1
00:00:09,046 --> 00:00:10,379
Come in.

2
00:00:13,423 --> 00:00:15,120
Commander, I just received word

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,654
that a Valerian transport
has requested permission

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,671
to dock here at the station.

5
00:00:19,705 --> 00:00:21,038
Let me guess.

6
00:00:21,074 --> 00:00:23,876
You're here to recommend
that we deny that request.

7
00:00:23,914 --> 00:00:25,851
The Valerians ran
weapons-grade dolamide

8
00:00:25,886 --> 00:00:28,518
to Cardassian forces
during the occupation of Bajor.

9
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:30,119
I'm aware of that.

10
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:32,031
I believe they're continuing

11
00:00:32,067 --> 00:00:34,300
to ship weapons
to the Cardassians...

12
00:00:34,339 --> 00:00:36,640
weapons that could eventually
be used to attack Bajor.

13
00:00:36,678 --> 00:00:38,979
I share your concern, Major,
but unless we have proof

14
00:00:39,018 --> 00:00:40,214
to back up those charges...

15
00:00:40,253 --> 00:00:41,916
The proof is on that ship.

16
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,518
Let me conduct a search

17
00:00:43,562 --> 00:00:45,897
and if I find any dolamide,
we can confiscate it.

18
00:00:45,934 --> 00:00:47,130
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

19
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,639
Dolamide is used
for power generators

20
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:51,374
reactors and short-range
transports.

21
00:00:51,414 --> 00:00:52,713
And for weapons.

22
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,051
Only if it's extremely pure.

23
00:00:55,089 --> 00:00:57,857
So we're going to do nothing?

24
00:00:57,896 --> 00:00:59,126
I didn't say that.

25
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:02,572
We just can't board their ship
and start tearing it apart.

26
00:01:02,608 --> 00:01:04,237
Well, what can we do?

27
00:01:06,082 --> 00:01:07,779
You bring me evidence
that the Valerians

28
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,449
are dealing
in weapons-grade dolamide

29
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,484
and I promise you
that the Federation will use

30
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,591
every kind of diplomatic
pressure to stop them.

31
00:01:13,634 --> 00:01:15,228
You really think that'll work?

32
00:01:15,304 --> 00:01:16,363
It will if the Valerians

33
00:01:16,407 --> 00:01:18,469
want to continue trading
with the Federation.

34
00:01:20,182 --> 00:01:21,481
All right.

35
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:23,956
We'll try it your way.

36
00:01:23,991 --> 00:01:25,255
Good.

37
00:01:25,328 --> 00:01:26,627
Then you will see to it

38
00:01:26,665 --> 00:01:29,297
that the Valerian ship
is cleared for docking.

39
00:01:32,813 --> 00:01:35,377
Yes, sir.

40
00:01:35,419 --> 00:01:39,828
Chief, I have a subspace message
for you from your wife.

41
00:01:39,863 --> 00:01:41,298
They've arrived safely on Bajor.

42
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:44,933
Imagine taking
11 bored school kids on a visit

43
00:01:44,976 --> 00:01:47,277
to the grain-processing center
at Lasuma.

44
00:01:47,314 --> 00:01:48,510
I'm glad it's not me.

45
00:01:49,921 --> 00:01:51,049
Major.

46
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,186
Here's the information
you requested

47
00:01:53,228 --> 00:01:55,324
on the Captain
of the Valerian ship.

48
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:57,338
Let me know
if you find anything else.

49
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:00,468
Sensors are reading elevated
neutrino levels at the wormhole.

50
00:02:00,512 --> 00:02:02,813
Something's coming through.

51
00:02:02,852 --> 00:02:04,846
On screen.

52
00:02:08,866 --> 00:02:12,170
Kira to Sisko.
You better come out here.

53
00:02:14,279 --> 00:02:16,843
It's the Klingon
Vessel <i>Toh'Kaht.</i>

54
00:02:16,885 --> 00:02:20,052
They weren't due back
for another month.

55
00:02:20,093 --> 00:02:22,223
Open hailing frequencies.

56
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:28,903
I'm reading
a transporter signal.

57
00:02:28,947 --> 00:02:31,418
Somebody must have beamed off
the ship just as it exploded.

58
00:02:35,429 --> 00:02:36,625
Mr. O'Brien?

59
00:02:38,671 --> 00:02:41,907
Something's interfering with
the rematerialization process.

60
00:02:41,945 --> 00:02:44,611
Lock onto him
with our transporter signal.

61
00:02:44,651 --> 00:02:46,280
Try boosting
the annular containment field.

62
00:02:46,323 --> 00:02:47,690
I'm already there.

63
00:02:58,417 --> 00:02:59,886
He's been hit by weapons fire.

64
00:02:59,922 --> 00:03:00,981
It's severe.

65
00:03:01,024 --> 00:03:02,927
We've got to get him
to cryostasis.

66
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:07,669
Victory.

67
00:03:13,086 --> 00:03:15,250
He's dead.

68
00:05:18,374 --> 00:05:22,544
Station Log, Stardate 46922.3.

69
00:05:22,584 --> 00:05:24,987
We have identified
the dead Klingon.

70
00:05:25,023 --> 00:05:28,361
His name was Hon'Tihl,
First Officer of the <i>Toh'Kaht.</i>

71
00:05:28,398 --> 00:05:31,530
Why he died, and the cause
of the ship's destruction

72
00:05:31,573 --> 00:05:33,544
is still unknown.

73
00:05:33,577 --> 00:05:35,605
I found
tritanium alloy fragments

74
00:05:35,648 --> 00:05:37,049
in his chest and upper arms.

75
00:05:37,085 --> 00:05:39,056
If that were all,
we could have saved him

76
00:05:39,124 --> 00:05:41,061
but those weapon burns
were too severe.

77
00:05:41,095 --> 00:05:43,693
Is there any way to identify
the kind of weapon used?

78
00:05:43,735 --> 00:05:45,329
I'm running a microtissue
analysis right now.

79
00:05:45,372 --> 00:05:47,069
I should have the results
in a couple of hours.

80
00:05:47,143 --> 00:05:48,076
The Klingon said

81
00:05:48,146 --> 00:05:49,513
"victory" just before he died.

82
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:50,643
I wonder what he meant.

83
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,085
According
to Klingon High Command

84
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:54,558
the <i>Toh'Kaht</i> was
in the Gamma Quadrant

85
00:05:54,594 --> 00:05:56,029
on a routine bio-survey mission.

86
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:58,536
"Victory" during a bio-survey?

87
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:02,033
As I recall, the <i>Toh'Kaht</i> put in
for a maintenance check.

88
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,138
Ask around the station

89
00:06:03,182 --> 00:06:05,517
and see what you can learn
about this bio-survey.

90
00:06:07,091 --> 00:06:09,791
Dax and O'Brien, I'd like the
two of you to take a runabout

91
00:06:09,831 --> 00:06:11,995
and try to find the <i>Toh'Kaht's</i>
mission recorder.

92
00:06:12,036 --> 00:06:14,234
I want to know what caused
that ship to explode.

93
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:15,766
Aye, sir.

94
00:06:23,697 --> 00:06:25,098
Lieutenant?

95
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,433
Yes?

96
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,769
You coming?

97
00:06:27,807 --> 00:06:29,242
Yes.

98
00:06:29,277 --> 00:06:30,576
I'm sorry.

99
00:06:30,614 --> 00:06:32,608
Never mind.

100
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,523
Damn it, not yet.

101
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:55,001
Deep Space 9, this is
Valerian Vessel <i>Sherval Das.</i>

102
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,306
We are entering
the Bajoran system.

103
00:06:57,344 --> 00:06:58,973
Clear us for docking.

104
00:06:59,015 --> 00:07:00,416
Negative, <i>Sherval Das.</i>

105
00:07:00,452 --> 00:07:02,787
There's going to be
a slight delay.

106
00:07:02,824 --> 00:07:04,852
We are in need of maintenance.

107
00:07:04,896 --> 00:07:06,593
It's been a long journey.

108
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:10,074
Oh, I'm sure it has,
but we have our own problems.

109
00:07:10,108 --> 00:07:12,579
You'll just have to wait.

110
00:07:12,615 --> 00:07:15,679
Stand by, <i>Sherval Das.</i>

111
00:07:15,722 --> 00:07:17,556
I'd like an explanation.

112
00:07:17,593 --> 00:07:19,826
I wasn't finished running
a background check

113
00:07:19,865 --> 00:07:21,164
on their ship.

114
00:07:21,202 --> 00:07:22,899
We agreed there
would be no delays

115
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:24,169
in the docking procedure.

116
00:07:24,276 --> 00:07:27,272
They just visited
Fahleena III and Mariah IV...

117
00:07:27,316 --> 00:07:28,785
the same two stops
they used to make

118
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:31,656
when they were running
dolamide to the Cardassians.

119
00:07:31,693 --> 00:07:34,359
The last stop would be
the purification plant

120
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,699
at Ultima Thule.

121
00:07:35,736 --> 00:07:37,205
Now, if I can place them there

122
00:07:37,307 --> 00:07:41,909
then we know they're running
weapons-grade material.

123
00:07:41,951 --> 00:07:44,924
Your ship has been
cleared for docking.

124
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,359
Thank you, Commander.

125
00:07:46,395 --> 00:07:47,989
<i>Sherval Das</i> out.

126
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:51,501
No delays.

127
00:07:56,219 --> 00:07:58,417
So, Quark

128
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:01,522
I heard you had some
problems with the Klingons

129
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:03,536
the last time they came through.

130
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,099
Spare me from beings
who think pain is pleasure.

131
00:08:08,248 --> 00:08:12,919
In small doses, perhaps,
but the Klingons

132
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,519
oh, they're hard
on the holosuites.

133
00:08:14,562 --> 00:08:15,758
They wreck the furniture.

134
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:19,069
I'm still fixing
the walls of Holosuite 6.

135
00:08:19,107 --> 00:08:21,909
I'm not saying
they don't spend big.

136
00:08:21,947 --> 00:08:24,647
I'm just saying, by the time
you figure in the damage

137
00:08:24,687 --> 00:08:26,681
I'm lucky to break even.

138
00:08:26,725 --> 00:08:30,063
They do tend toward bluster,
don't they?

139
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,698
Throwing their weight around,
bragging...

140
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,904
This crew was worse
than the last.

141
00:08:34,945 --> 00:08:36,916
A glorious mission!

142
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,613
I said, "What's so glorious

143
00:08:38,654 --> 00:08:40,887
about a Gamma Quadrant
bio-survey?"

144
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:45,631
And, uh... what did they say?

145
00:08:53,356 --> 00:08:55,793
Crafty tonight, Odo, aren't we?

146
00:08:55,828 --> 00:08:58,357
Looking for clues about
the fate of the Klingons?

147
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,606
If I tell you what I heard...

148
00:09:02,645 --> 00:09:04,809
what do I get in return?

149
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,117
The chances are
what you heard won't help

150
00:09:07,155 --> 00:09:09,490
so why should I give you
something for it?

151
00:09:09,528 --> 00:09:14,199
Because otherwise,
I heard nothing.

152
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,301
That damaged holosuite...

153
00:09:16,411 --> 00:09:19,817
work crew seven
is probably doing the repairs.

154
00:09:19,853 --> 00:09:21,186
Am I right?

155
00:09:22,225 --> 00:09:23,558
Uh-huh.

156
00:09:23,595 --> 00:09:26,933
Well, it looks as though
I might have to put in

157
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,271
a priority request
for work crew seven.

158
00:09:29,309 --> 00:09:30,835
The bulkheads in security

159
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,679
could use
a little shoring up.

160
00:09:36,927 --> 00:09:38,624
They said...

161
00:09:38,664 --> 00:09:41,694
they'd be coming back
through the wormhole

162
00:09:41,738 --> 00:09:44,267
with something

163
00:09:44,311 --> 00:09:48,720
that would make the enemies
of the Klingon Empire tremble.

164
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,623
Their exact words?

165
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,688
Direct quote.

166
00:09:52,732 --> 00:09:55,101
You've been most helpful.

167
00:09:57,644 --> 00:09:59,706
Don't let it get around.

168
00:10:06,932 --> 00:10:08,265
Odo?

169
00:10:18,527 --> 00:10:21,432
Dr. Bashir!
Dr. Bashir!

170
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:22,902
Dr. Bashir!

171
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,634
Welcome back, Constable.

172
00:10:48,675 --> 00:10:51,044
How am I?

173
00:10:51,081 --> 00:10:53,109
How do you feel?

174
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,283
Fine.

175
00:10:55,324 --> 00:10:57,888
Good, because I have
no way to know.

176
00:10:57,931 --> 00:11:00,027
Your body chemistry
defies analysis.

177
00:11:10,862 --> 00:11:13,494
I don't remember anything

178
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:16,702
but I'm back to normal?

179
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,507
Well, like I said, you tell me.

180
00:11:18,547 --> 00:11:19,572
I don't know what caused it

181
00:11:19,616 --> 00:11:21,347
and I couldn't tell you
if it'll happen again.

182
00:11:21,387 --> 00:11:24,793
In fact, there's really
nothing more I can do here.

183
00:11:24,862 --> 00:11:28,063
Then thank you
for your time, Doctor.

184
00:11:31,244 --> 00:11:33,773
Tell me, Odo.

185
00:11:35,622 --> 00:11:38,754
Do you share my concern
over this Valerian situation?

186
00:11:38,795 --> 00:11:40,595
Concern?

187
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:42,571
I think you know what I mean.

188
00:11:42,604 --> 00:11:44,233
Why don't you tell me.

189
00:11:44,276 --> 00:11:46,713
Then you can be sure I know.

190
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:48,377
Just don't be surprised

191
00:11:48,418 --> 00:11:51,220
if the uneasy alliance
on this station

192
00:11:51,258 --> 00:11:53,856
starts to show a few cracks.

193
00:11:53,965 --> 00:11:56,870
What uneasy alliance?

194
00:11:56,972 --> 00:12:00,208
Commander Sisko and Kira.

195
00:12:00,247 --> 00:12:04,349
Mark my words,
there's going to be trouble.

196
00:12:09,536 --> 00:12:13,375
What exactly are you basing
all this on, Doctor?

197
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:19,090
Very clever, Constable.

198
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,654
But you're probably right.

199
00:12:21,698 --> 00:12:25,332
It's a little too early
to commit oneself either way.

200
00:12:25,374 --> 00:12:28,074
Are you finished with me?

201
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,845
Well, unless you'd like
to pour yourself

202
00:12:29,884 --> 00:12:31,148
through my phoretic analyzer.

203
00:12:31,187 --> 00:12:32,451
I'd love to see the results.

204
00:12:32,491 --> 00:12:34,485
Another time, perhaps.

205
00:12:45,488 --> 00:12:47,322
I've got them.

206
00:12:48,596 --> 00:12:49,895
Who?

207
00:12:49,932 --> 00:12:51,231
The Valerians.

208
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:54,766
Their ship was at the Ultima
Thule station one week ago.

209
00:12:54,811 --> 00:12:56,110
That confirms it.

210
00:12:56,147 --> 00:12:57,616
They're definitely
running dolamide.

211
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:58,915
So?

212
00:12:58,954 --> 00:13:00,617
So I've got an armed team

213
00:13:00,658 --> 00:13:02,652
ready to board their vessel.

214
00:13:02,696 --> 00:13:04,325
Confiscate the material

215
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,999
and send them back
where they came from.

216
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,013
Frankly, I'm half-tempted
to take them to Bajor

217
00:13:10,048 --> 00:13:11,347
and press charges.

218
00:13:11,383 --> 00:13:13,616
By whose authority?

219
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:19,200
You're not going to do
anything about this.

220
00:13:19,236 --> 00:13:21,207
I'm not...

221
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,281
and neither are you.

222
00:13:25,819 --> 00:13:31,697
That ship is acting
against Bajoran interests.

223
00:13:31,733 --> 00:13:36,199
This station
is Bajoran property.

224
00:13:36,243 --> 00:13:40,116
Commanded
by a Federation officer.

225
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,624
Commanded by me.

226
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:45,096
Are you challenging that, Major?

227
00:13:49,341 --> 00:13:51,175
No, sir.

228
00:13:52,516 --> 00:13:55,114
Good.

229
00:13:59,165 --> 00:14:01,694
Short-range sensors
are picking up some debris.

230
00:14:01,738 --> 00:14:04,209
Looks like duranium alloy.

231
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:08,482
Probably pieces
of the Klingon secondary hull.

232
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,491
It's possible
their mission recorder

233
00:14:10,525 --> 00:14:12,085
is somewhere in the debris.

234
00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:13,894
The magnetic field
from the duranium

235
00:14:13,934 --> 00:14:15,905
could be masking it.

236
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:17,933
Let's get a little closer.

237
00:14:19,948 --> 00:14:23,218
Major Kira's
become awfully aggressive

238
00:14:23,256 --> 00:14:27,255
toward Commander Sisko lately
about station policy.

239
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,963
An honest difference of opinion.

240
00:14:30,373 --> 00:14:32,776
What if it's more
than a difference of opinion?

241
00:14:32,812 --> 00:14:36,378
What if Kira thinks the Bajorans
don't need us on DS9?

242
00:14:36,421 --> 00:14:38,050
It is their station.

243
00:14:38,092 --> 00:14:39,721
That would be suicidal.

244
00:14:39,762 --> 00:14:42,667
Without a Federation presence,
Bajor would be vulnerable

245
00:14:42,703 --> 00:14:44,400
again to the Cardassians.

246
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,408
Well, that doesn't mean

247
00:14:45,443 --> 00:14:47,208
there aren't plenty
of misguided Bajorans

248
00:14:47,246 --> 00:14:48,579
who think they can go it alone.

249
00:14:53,328 --> 00:14:57,566
You've become quite friendly
with Major Kira, haven't you?

250
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:00,099
Have I?

251
00:15:00,144 --> 00:15:04,017
Well, yes, I suppose I have,
if you say so.

252
00:15:04,054 --> 00:15:05,044
Well, I wouldn't get

253
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:07,219
too friendly with the natives,
if I were you.

254
00:15:07,261 --> 00:15:09,425
Remember
where your loyalties lie.

255
00:15:09,466 --> 00:15:10,958
Of course.

256
00:15:11,004 --> 00:15:14,445
Benjamin and I have been close
for a long time.

257
00:15:14,478 --> 00:15:15,811
Hand and glove.

258
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:18,548
I'm on his side...
no question about it.

259
00:15:18,588 --> 00:15:20,559
That reminds me

260
00:15:20,593 --> 00:15:22,028
- of the time we found...
- Good.

261
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,772
Anyone who's against Sisko
is against me.

262
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:33,955
I'm picking up a weak subspace
transponder signal.

263
00:15:33,992 --> 00:15:35,655
It's the mission recorder.

264
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,891
Constable.

265
00:15:47,925 --> 00:15:49,896
Can I help you, Major?

266
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:52,903
Oh, you always manage
to help me, Odo.

267
00:15:52,937 --> 00:15:57,346
In fact, I think we work
pretty well together

268
00:15:57,381 --> 00:15:58,543
you and I.

269
00:15:59,587 --> 00:16:02,219
Yes, I suppose our relationship

270
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,960
has always been... cooperative.

271
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,971
Exactly.

272
00:16:07,005 --> 00:16:10,468
And that's just
what I need right now...

273
00:16:10,513 --> 00:16:12,507
your cooperation.

274
00:16:13,654 --> 00:16:17,254
I'm convinced the Valerians
have dolamide on board

275
00:16:17,296 --> 00:16:20,463
but the evidence is
still circumstantial.

276
00:16:20,504 --> 00:16:23,477
I need solid proof.

277
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:27,179
I want you to slip

278
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,657
past their security systems

279
00:16:29,693 --> 00:16:32,164
and into their cargo bay.

280
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:34,932
I heard that Commander Sisko
was adamant

281
00:16:34,972 --> 00:16:37,911
about not interfering
with the Valerian ship.

282
00:16:37,945 --> 00:16:39,539
Has he changed his mind?

283
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:40,881
Yes.

284
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:42,947
How odd.

285
00:16:47,067 --> 00:16:48,970
Very well.

286
00:16:49,006 --> 00:16:52,503
I'll keep the two of you
informed about my progress.

287
00:16:52,547 --> 00:16:54,518
That won't be necessary.

288
00:16:54,551 --> 00:16:56,419
Commander Sisko's very busy.

289
00:16:56,456 --> 00:16:58,290
No sense in disturbing him.

290
00:17:06,147 --> 00:17:08,618
I can't fool you, Odo.

291
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:15,294
You wanted me to go
behind Sisko's back, didn't you?

292
00:17:18,276 --> 00:17:19,973
Forget it.

293
00:17:20,013 --> 00:17:22,007
Bad idea.

294
00:17:27,698 --> 00:17:30,192
What if you had to choose sides?

295
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:36,041
Just remember
who your friends are.

296
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:52,002
Personal Log, Miles O'Brien.
Stardate 46923.1.

297
00:17:52,043 --> 00:17:53,376
We've managed to retrieve

298
00:17:53,413 --> 00:17:55,714
a portion of
the Klingon officer's journal.

299
00:17:55,752 --> 00:17:58,246
Of course, Major Kira
heard about it immediately.

300
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,762
She must have spies everywhere.

301
00:18:00,797 --> 00:18:03,234
I believe the Captain
has gone insane.

302
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,673
He executed
two more crew members...

303
00:18:08,015 --> 00:18:10,988
...medical officer...
...my quarters...

304
00:18:11,022 --> 00:18:12,787
...violence

305
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,492
is being created by those...

306
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:18,301
energy spheres we brought back
from Saltah'na.

307
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,803
Believing him
to be the Captain's spy

308
00:18:21,881 --> 00:18:24,375
I slit...

309
00:18:24,421 --> 00:18:25,788
I've seen enough.

310
00:18:25,824 --> 00:18:26,952
There's more.

311
00:18:26,994 --> 00:18:29,329
Klingons' mission
must have failed.

312
00:18:29,366 --> 00:18:31,131
That failure caused
problems on board.

313
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:34,302
I couldn't care less
what happened to a Klingon ship.

314
00:18:34,345 --> 00:18:37,147
Well, the Klingons
might want to know.

315
00:18:37,185 --> 00:18:39,053
Dax and I have set up
a data interpolation

316
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,218
to fill in what's missing.

317
00:18:40,258 --> 00:18:41,352
It might take some time.

318
00:18:41,395 --> 00:18:42,694
If you have to.

319
00:18:42,732 --> 00:18:45,705
The search itself
is often reward enough.

320
00:18:45,739 --> 00:18:48,108
Benjamin, do you remember
that...

321
00:18:48,144 --> 00:18:50,445
Fine.
Do whatever you have to do.

322
00:18:50,483 --> 00:18:52,454
Don't bother me with it.

323
00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:07,390
Ah...

324
00:19:07,424 --> 00:19:09,053
Here we are.

325
00:19:09,094 --> 00:19:11,395
A Modela aperitif.

326
00:19:11,434 --> 00:19:13,871
It's bright and sweet.

327
00:19:13,939 --> 00:19:15,739
Much like yourself, Lieutenant.

328
00:19:15,777 --> 00:19:17,873
I'll put it on your tab.

329
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:20,217
The bad flattery's on the house.

330
00:19:20,254 --> 00:19:23,056
The two loveliest creatures
on DS9.

331
00:19:23,094 --> 00:19:25,896
I must be living correctly
to be so...

332
00:19:25,935 --> 00:19:27,735
so blessed.

333
00:19:27,773 --> 00:19:29,869
What can I do for you, Major?

334
00:19:29,911 --> 00:19:32,314
Get lost.

335
00:19:35,157 --> 00:19:37,151
As you wish.

336
00:19:43,511 --> 00:19:46,484
How are you, Lieutenant?

337
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,819
You know what they say...

338
00:19:48,856 --> 00:19:52,160
put the shoe
on the right foot first

339
00:19:52,198 --> 00:19:55,866
but put the left foot first
into the bathtub.

340
00:19:57,544 --> 00:19:59,515
I understand.

341
00:19:59,549 --> 00:20:03,514
But what I really meant was...

342
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:05,860
are you happy?

343
00:20:05,897 --> 00:20:09,531
That's not a question
I get asked very often.

344
00:20:09,573 --> 00:20:11,544
Oh, but it should be.

345
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:12,877
In my opinion

346
00:20:12,914 --> 00:20:16,719
you are the most valuable
officer on this station.

347
00:20:16,756 --> 00:20:18,225
May I?

348
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,923
Please.

349
00:20:25,444 --> 00:20:27,415
Not bad.

350
00:20:27,449 --> 00:20:29,043
For Quark.

351
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:30,953
It is good.

352
00:20:33,129 --> 00:20:37,595
I couldn't imagine running
this station without you.

353
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,137
Are you trying
to tell me something?

354
00:20:42,986 --> 00:20:47,088
My disagreement with Sisko
over the Valerians is no secret.

355
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:50,797
Well, you know how he gets
once he's made a decision.

356
00:20:50,838 --> 00:20:53,902
Yeah, it's like talking
to a stone.

357
00:20:53,945 --> 00:20:57,511
I remember a time...
on Rochani III

358
00:20:57,554 --> 00:21:00,118
we were cornered
by a party of Kaleans

359
00:21:00,227 --> 00:21:03,668
who were not very happy
to see us, but Benjamin...

360
00:21:03,703 --> 00:21:06,505
Y-You told me
this story this morning.

361
00:21:06,543 --> 00:21:08,343
Oh.

362
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,148
I suppose I did.

363
00:21:13,492 --> 00:21:16,693
If you were to talk
to Starfleet Command

364
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:19,298
tell them how displeased
the Bajorans are

365
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,641
with Sisko's handling of this.

366
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,379
I know they'll listen to you.

367
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:28,885
I was decorated
on my very first mission.

368
00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:31,230
The Admiral was a Vulcan.

369
00:21:31,268 --> 00:21:34,241
So during
the presentation ceremony...

370
00:21:34,275 --> 00:21:36,246
Dax.

371
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,683
We have to keep
the Valerians here

372
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,593
until we can search the ship
and confiscate the dolamide.

373
00:21:42,629 --> 00:21:44,862
You've got to convince
Starfleet.

374
00:21:44,901 --> 00:21:48,968
It's for the good of Bajor...
and the Federation.

375
00:21:49,011 --> 00:21:53,181
I've been friends
with Benjamin Sisko

376
00:21:53,288 --> 00:21:56,785
for... many years.

377
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:00,863
In many ways, he's like a son...

378
00:22:00,906 --> 00:22:03,538
or a nephew.

379
00:22:03,579 --> 00:22:06,883
Some kind of close relative,
anyway.

380
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,391
Jadzia, listen to me.

381
00:22:09,427 --> 00:22:14,029
I'm getting rid of Sisko,
one way or the other.

382
00:22:14,071 --> 00:22:18,571
Don't force me to get
rid of you as well.

383
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:31,512
Would you like to join us?

384
00:22:31,546 --> 00:22:33,175
Let me go!

385
00:22:33,217 --> 00:22:35,188
What did you hear?

386
00:22:35,222 --> 00:22:36,589
Nothing.

387
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,060
Nothing at all.

388
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:44,833
Good.

389
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:05,758
Is this a Ferengi fashion
I'm not aware of?

390
00:23:05,794 --> 00:23:10,636
Kira tried to tear my head off.

391
00:23:12,644 --> 00:23:14,979
I want to file charges.

392
00:23:15,017 --> 00:23:16,543
Tell me about it.

393
00:23:16,587 --> 00:23:19,219
I heard her plotting.

394
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,362
Go on.

395
00:23:23,404 --> 00:23:28,678
She tried to convince Dax
to take her side against Sisko.

396
00:23:30,019 --> 00:23:32,719
And did Dax seem persuaded?

397
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:34,456
What difference does that make?

398
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:36,468
I was attacked!

399
00:23:36,501 --> 00:23:38,130
Answer the question.

400
00:23:40,511 --> 00:23:42,641
I... I couldn't tell.

401
00:23:42,683 --> 00:23:44,677
She was on the fence.

402
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:51,097
Doesn't Kira's behavior seem
a little out of the ordinary?

403
00:23:51,137 --> 00:23:52,538
And the others...

404
00:23:52,574 --> 00:23:54,977
at the staff briefing,
Sisko was bored

405
00:23:55,012 --> 00:23:58,817
as if he couldn't be bothered
about running the station.

406
00:23:58,856 --> 00:24:00,827
And Bashir...

407
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:05,269
since when is he so concerned
about station politics?

408
00:24:06,607 --> 00:24:08,578
Don't look at me that way.

409
00:24:08,612 --> 00:24:10,138
I'm perfectly normal.

410
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:13,679
Yes, I suppose you are.

411
00:24:13,724 --> 00:24:17,426
It's time
I had a talk with Sisko.

412
00:24:17,467 --> 00:24:19,061
Odo, wait!

413
00:24:19,104 --> 00:24:21,337
Odo!

414
00:24:21,442 --> 00:24:23,879
Wait, Odo!

415
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:25,910
Odo!

416
00:24:25,953 --> 00:24:28,619
I want satisfaction!

417
00:24:30,565 --> 00:24:34,667
We have...
battle for decks... 12.

418
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:39,048
...armory... in the hands...
Captain Tel'Peh

419
00:24:39,085 --> 00:24:40,816
...my death.

420
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:43,190
But still, I... confident

421
00:24:43,229 --> 00:24:46,031
...gain control of this ship.

422
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:48,302
I am weakened by my wounds.

423
00:24:48,341 --> 00:24:49,640
Sisko?

424
00:24:49,677 --> 00:24:51,944
...my enemies closing in.

425
00:24:51,983 --> 00:24:55,856
Still... hide...

426
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:57,942
Come in.

427
00:24:58,075 --> 00:25:02,074
First Officer's Journal, Day 26.

428
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:03,748
Where's Commander Sisko?

429
00:25:03,789 --> 00:25:07,491
In his quarters
where he's safe.

430
00:25:07,532 --> 00:25:12,100
Still... been able to hide
a thalmerite device

431
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:16,016
under... beam near
the reactor... deck 26.

432
00:25:16,052 --> 00:25:18,387
Rather... taken prisoner

433
00:25:18,424 --> 00:25:23,060
I will blow up this ship
and transport to safety.

434
00:25:23,102 --> 00:25:27,808
Perhaps Medical Officer Kee'Bhor
was correct.

435
00:25:27,847 --> 00:25:31,880
Our... began when we opened
those energy spheres.

436
00:25:31,924 --> 00:25:36,162
All I know
is that Captain Tel'Peh

437
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:39,140
must die!

438
00:25:39,174 --> 00:25:41,611
Journal closed.

439
00:25:41,646 --> 00:25:43,411
Sounds like

440
00:25:43,451 --> 00:25:45,752
there was a power struggle
on board.

441
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,852
Some sort of attempted takeover.

442
00:25:47,895 --> 00:25:49,524
Management by mutiny.

443
00:25:49,565 --> 00:25:53,062
Standard operating procedure
on a Klingon vessel.

444
00:25:53,107 --> 00:25:58,108
But awfully unusual for a
Federation-run space station.

445
00:25:58,152 --> 00:25:59,451
Don't worry.

446
00:25:59,489 --> 00:26:02,759
If Major Kira tries anything,
we'll be ready.

447
00:26:04,969 --> 00:26:07,840
When will the other log entries
be available?

448
00:26:07,876 --> 00:26:09,175
At the current rate

449
00:26:09,213 --> 00:26:12,050
of processing, it'll take
at least seven more hours.

450
00:26:12,086 --> 00:26:14,250
But the computer's taking it
one entry at a time.

451
00:26:14,292 --> 00:26:17,424
I'll set it up
so you can access it as it goes.

452
00:26:17,465 --> 00:26:18,991
Thank you, Chief.

453
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:20,472
Of course, Constable.

454
00:26:20,507 --> 00:26:22,136
Don't the Commander and I

455
00:26:22,177 --> 00:26:24,341
always try to make you happy?

456
00:26:46,235 --> 00:26:48,206
What are you doing here?

457
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:50,233
Chief O'Brien's orders.

458
00:26:58,664 --> 00:27:00,327
Come in.

459
00:27:06,383 --> 00:27:08,012
Commander.

460
00:27:08,054 --> 00:27:09,717
Hello, Constable.

461
00:27:09,757 --> 00:27:11,728
How are you today?

462
00:27:11,762 --> 00:27:13,824
Concerned, sir.

463
00:27:13,934 --> 00:27:15,928
On such a fine afternoon?

464
00:27:15,972 --> 00:27:17,943
How inappropriate.

465
00:27:17,977 --> 00:27:23,389
Commander, I think
something might be wrong

466
00:27:23,424 --> 00:27:25,725
with... some of us.

467
00:27:25,763 --> 00:27:28,395
Ever since the Klingon ship
exploded

468
00:27:28,436 --> 00:27:30,873
and their First Officer
beamed over

469
00:27:30,942 --> 00:27:36,786
certain behaviors and attitudes
have been... abnormal.

470
00:27:41,767 --> 00:27:46,005
There appears to have been
a mutiny on the Klingon ship.

471
00:27:46,044 --> 00:27:48,311
I wouldn't go so far as to say

472
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,914
the same thing is
happening on DS9

473
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:57,404
but I... do find
some disturbing parallels.

474
00:27:57,438 --> 00:28:00,070
If something's bothering you,
Odo

475
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:02,413
tell it to Mr. O'Brien.

476
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:04,444
That's what he's there for.

477
00:28:08,666 --> 00:28:10,660
What do you think?

478
00:28:17,386 --> 00:28:19,015
What is it?

479
00:28:19,057 --> 00:28:20,686
A clock.

480
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:27,499
Fascinating, isn't it?

481
00:28:45,453 --> 00:28:48,757
It's not nice
to keep a friend waiting.

482
00:28:48,795 --> 00:28:52,702
Did we have an appointment?

483
00:28:54,509 --> 00:28:59,009
When have I ever had to stand
on ceremony with you, Odo?

484
00:29:03,363 --> 00:29:05,561
I need your help.

485
00:29:07,707 --> 00:29:10,977
I took care of the Valerians.

486
00:29:11,048 --> 00:29:12,517
What do you mean?

487
00:29:12,552 --> 00:29:14,420
I locked down
their docking clamps.

488
00:29:14,457 --> 00:29:17,430
That ship isn't leaving
until I say it is.

489
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:21,531
O'Brien will need at least a day
to do anything about it.

490
00:29:21,574 --> 00:29:23,374
By then, it won't matter.

491
00:29:25,216 --> 00:29:27,848
You're going after Sisko.

492
00:29:27,889 --> 00:29:30,828
And O'Brien.

493
00:29:30,863 --> 00:29:34,429
Either we get a more reasonable
Commander from Starfleet...

494
00:29:34,471 --> 00:29:37,308
someone we can control...

495
00:29:37,345 --> 00:29:39,578
or we go it alone.

496
00:29:39,617 --> 00:29:41,588
With me running this place

497
00:29:41,622 --> 00:29:44,926
you will be able to do
what needs to be done.

498
00:29:44,962 --> 00:29:47,935
If you want to toss
Quark out on his ears

499
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,439
toss him out.

500
00:29:49,474 --> 00:29:51,342
If you want to proclaim
martial law

501
00:29:51,378 --> 00:29:52,972
on the Promenade, proclaim it.

502
00:29:53,016 --> 00:29:55,580
This station will be yours
to protect

503
00:29:55,621 --> 00:29:57,615
with no interference.

504
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:00,633
What's your plan?

505
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,003
Oh, Odo...

506
00:30:05,045 --> 00:30:08,781
I trust you more than
anyone on this station

507
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,691
because you can't be corrupted.

508
00:30:13,264 --> 00:30:15,667
But this is a dangerous time.

509
00:30:15,703 --> 00:30:18,767
I can't take any chances,
even with you.

510
00:30:18,811 --> 00:30:22,684
When the time comes

511
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,714
you'll know it.

512
00:30:26,897 --> 00:30:30,497
I'll be counting on you.

513
00:30:37,489 --> 00:30:41,328
Computer, open a channel
to Starfleet Headquarters.

514
00:30:41,364 --> 00:30:44,770
Subspace communication
to Federation territories

515
00:30:44,806 --> 00:30:46,606
is currently unavailable.

516
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:47,738
Why?

517
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,842
By authority of Major Kira.

518
00:30:49,885 --> 00:30:51,685
Ah...

519
00:30:51,723 --> 00:30:55,323
Open a channel
to the Bajoran Council.

520
00:30:55,365 --> 00:30:58,931
Communication to Bajor
is currently unavailable.

521
00:30:58,974 --> 00:31:01,879
By authority of Chief O'Brien.

522
00:31:01,914 --> 00:31:05,150
That is correct.

523
00:31:05,189 --> 00:31:08,459
Computer, are you finished
reconstructing the journal

524
00:31:08,496 --> 00:31:11,128
of the Klingon First Officer?

525
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:13,470
Data interpolation is complete.

526
00:31:13,508 --> 00:31:15,536
On screen.

527
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:18,382
Computer, scan the journal

528
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:23,694
for mention of contact
with any alien race.

529
00:31:23,733 --> 00:31:25,202
One entry found.

530
00:31:25,237 --> 00:31:27,640
Play it.

531
00:31:27,676 --> 00:31:32,016
First Officer's Journal, Day 22.

532
00:31:32,053 --> 00:31:36,621
Exploration of the fifth planet
proved to be a waste of time.

533
00:31:36,664 --> 00:31:40,036
This world is not worthy
of a Klingon colony.

534
00:31:40,072 --> 00:31:43,808
All we found were
a collection of energy spheres

535
00:31:43,848 --> 00:31:47,448
which possess some type
of telepathic archive.

536
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:50,896
The spheres described
an ancient power struggle

537
00:31:50,932 --> 00:31:54,099
that destroyed a race
called the Saltah'na.

538
00:31:54,139 --> 00:31:57,580
We will forward our results
to our science division.

539
00:32:00,536 --> 00:32:03,668
Kira's already locked down
the Valerian ship

540
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:04,838
and she's diverted

541
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,512
half the station's systems
to her control.

542
00:32:07,553 --> 00:32:08,612
Since when?

543
00:32:08,655 --> 00:32:10,056
An hour ago.

544
00:32:10,092 --> 00:32:11,493
I've heard
some disturbing rumors

545
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:13,363
from our people
on the Promenade.

546
00:32:15,974 --> 00:32:18,811
I think she's going to make
an attempt on your life.

547
00:32:21,486 --> 00:32:24,118
I want you to arrest them...

548
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,132
Kira and every Bajoran
officer on this station.

549
00:32:27,166 --> 00:32:29,467
I want the name
of every sympathizer.

550
00:32:29,505 --> 00:32:31,999
That's not a good idea, sir.

551
00:32:32,045 --> 00:32:37,149
There's a lot more of them
than there are of us.

552
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:40,562
If we tip our hand,
it might work against us.

553
00:32:42,336 --> 00:32:43,965
What can we do?

554
00:32:44,007 --> 00:32:45,340
Leave the station.

555
00:32:45,377 --> 00:32:47,177
Never! Get me a phaser!

556
00:32:47,214 --> 00:32:48,683
I'll get rid of Kira!

557
00:32:48,718 --> 00:32:50,119
Hear me out, sir.

558
00:32:50,155 --> 00:32:53,687
We leave the station,
raise a Federation attack force

559
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:54,994
and return.

560
00:32:55,033 --> 00:32:56,502
And, on that day

561
00:32:56,537 --> 00:33:00,034
we'll get rid
of all your enemies.

562
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:07,755
How do we proceed?

563
00:33:07,797 --> 00:33:10,463
I'll need a few more hours
to free up the Valerian ship.

564
00:33:10,504 --> 00:33:12,235
I've already talked
to their Captain.

565
00:33:12,274 --> 00:33:15,042
He's more than happy to take us
back to Federation space.

566
00:33:16,585 --> 00:33:18,715
Call me as soon as you're ready.

567
00:33:26,409 --> 00:33:28,846
It'll take effect
in two minutes.

568
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:31,376
Plenty of time to get a good...

569
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:39,364
Plenty of time for you
to get a good night's sleep.

570
00:33:39,406 --> 00:33:40,602
Thank you, Doctor.

571
00:33:43,716 --> 00:33:45,345
Chronic insomnia.

572
00:33:45,388 --> 00:33:47,017
I think it's hormonal.

573
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:48,687
So, how are you?

574
00:33:48,728 --> 00:33:51,929
I take it you've completed
your autopsy of the Klingon.

575
00:33:52,003 --> 00:33:53,199
Of course.

576
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,607
You know, Odo

577
00:33:54,643 --> 00:33:56,944
events have been moving
rather rapidly

578
00:33:56,982 --> 00:33:58,246
since our last conversation.

579
00:33:58,285 --> 00:34:00,449
I'd advise you
to choose sides now

580
00:34:00,491 --> 00:34:03,259
or risk finding yourself
without any friends at all.

581
00:34:03,297 --> 00:34:05,564
The Klingon, Doctor...
what did you find?

582
00:34:05,603 --> 00:34:08,074
He's still dead,
if that's what you mean.

583
00:34:08,108 --> 00:34:10,306
I don't have time for jokes.

584
00:34:10,347 --> 00:34:16,488
Your findings could determine
who controls this station.

585
00:34:18,065 --> 00:34:19,534
How?

586
00:34:19,569 --> 00:34:21,437
All in good time.

587
00:34:21,474 --> 00:34:25,313
First, tell me
about the Klingon.

588
00:34:25,349 --> 00:34:30,818
Well, I found
nothing very unusual.

589
00:34:30,863 --> 00:34:33,461
The columnar cells
in his brain stem, perhaps.

590
00:34:33,503 --> 00:34:35,838
The membrane permeability
was off.

591
00:34:35,875 --> 00:34:36,934
What could cause that?

592
00:34:36,978 --> 00:34:37,968
Any number of things.

593
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,609
Could it have something
to do with telepathy?

594
00:34:40,653 --> 00:34:43,124
The Klingons were studying
the telepathic archives

595
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,526
of an ancient race.

596
00:34:44,562 --> 00:34:45,997
If those archives were contained

597
00:34:46,066 --> 00:34:48,537
in a self-sustaining
energy matrix

598
00:34:48,572 --> 00:34:52,411
that could explain the changes
in the Klingon's brain.

599
00:34:52,448 --> 00:34:55,478
Could that energy matrix
have somehow caused them

600
00:34:55,522 --> 00:34:59,224
to reenact the power struggle
that destroyed the Saltah'nans?

601
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,893
Possibly.

602
00:35:00,935 --> 00:35:02,769
What are you getting at?

603
00:35:02,806 --> 00:35:07,112
Doctor, I believe the Klingon
brought the matrix with him

604
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:09,621
and everyone in Ops
was affected except me.

605
00:35:09,656 --> 00:35:12,254
Without a humanoid brain,
my system rejected it.

606
00:35:12,295 --> 00:35:15,736
An interesting theory,
Constable

607
00:35:15,771 --> 00:35:19,907
but I'm certainly not behaving
out of the ordinary.

608
00:35:19,947 --> 00:35:23,011
Of course not

609
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:25,389
but what if you and I

610
00:35:25,427 --> 00:35:28,457
are the only two
who aren't affected?

611
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:31,030
Do you think we could use this
to our advantage?

612
00:35:31,107 --> 00:35:33,408
Exactly.

613
00:35:33,447 --> 00:35:34,916
Tell me your plan.

614
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:37,046
The first thing we have to do
is figure out

615
00:35:37,155 --> 00:35:39,719
how to remove the field
from everyone affected.

616
00:35:39,761 --> 00:35:41,492
Then we'd lose our advantage.

617
00:35:41,532 --> 00:35:44,369
Would you prefer that someone
blew up the station?

618
00:35:44,406 --> 00:35:45,705
I see your point.

619
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:48,716
The power to control
the energy matrix

620
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:51,655
is the power
to control this station.

621
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:54,254
If I could determine the natural
resonance frequencies

622
00:35:54,296 --> 00:35:55,458
of this telepathic field

623
00:35:55,499 --> 00:35:57,868
I might be able to generate
an interference signal

624
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,101
which could drive it out.

625
00:35:59,175 --> 00:36:00,405
Do it.

626
00:36:00,444 --> 00:36:04,180
I promise, Doctor,
you won't regret it.

627
00:36:11,771 --> 00:36:13,502
O'Brien, what's taking so long?

628
00:36:13,543 --> 00:36:14,637
Almost there, sir.

629
00:36:14,678 --> 00:36:15,737
We've got one more level

630
00:36:15,781 --> 00:36:17,444
of security lockouts
to break through

631
00:36:17,485 --> 00:36:19,422
and the Valerian ship
will be ready to go.

632
00:36:19,456 --> 00:36:21,927
Commander, I have
the report you asked for

633
00:36:21,962 --> 00:36:23,488
on those weapon scanners.

634
00:36:23,533 --> 00:36:25,093
Give it to Mr. O'Brien.

635
00:36:25,204 --> 00:36:29,043
I really think
you should see this, sir.

636
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:29,808
Commander!

637
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:36,061
Dax to Kira.

638
00:36:41,242 --> 00:36:42,141
Is it Kira?

639
00:36:42,245 --> 00:36:43,737
Did Kira put you up to this?

640
00:36:43,781 --> 00:36:45,615
No.

641
00:37:01,457 --> 00:37:02,926
I want the truth!

642
00:37:02,961 --> 00:37:04,955
Is that clear?!

643
00:37:09,911 --> 00:37:12,611
Let's see how this works.

644
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:17,857
Put it down...

645
00:37:17,897 --> 00:37:19,560
sir.

646
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,793
Take them.

647
00:37:53,949 --> 00:37:57,412
Dax, you were supposed
to deactivate the transporter.

648
00:37:57,458 --> 00:37:59,258
I forgot.

649
00:37:59,296 --> 00:38:01,928
Damn it, Kira must have
set up a force field

650
00:38:01,968 --> 00:38:03,699
to keep us from beaming
onto the Valerian ship.

651
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,936
The transporter
rerouted us here.

652
00:38:04,975 --> 00:38:07,208
We've got to get to that ship.

653
00:38:07,315 --> 00:38:08,944
Odo's our only chance.

654
00:38:08,985 --> 00:38:11,958
He might be able
to override the field.

655
00:38:11,992 --> 00:38:13,963
You're sure we can trust him?

656
00:38:13,997 --> 00:38:16,230
I don't see
that we have any choice.

657
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:17,532
Sisko to Odo.

658
00:38:19,711 --> 00:38:21,408
Odo here.

659
00:38:21,449 --> 00:38:22,748
Kira has moved against us.

660
00:38:22,785 --> 00:38:24,015
She has Dax on her side.

661
00:38:24,055 --> 00:38:26,253
We need your help, Constable.

662
00:38:26,293 --> 00:38:29,597
You've got to clear us a path
to the Valerian ship.

663
00:38:29,635 --> 00:38:32,574
Take Crossover Bridge 1
to the cargo bay entrance

664
00:38:32,609 --> 00:38:34,101
into Docking Port Four.

665
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:35,274
I'll keep it open for you.

666
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:37,377
Right. Sisko out.

667
00:38:38,724 --> 00:38:41,093
Leave your combadge here.

668
00:38:42,232 --> 00:38:45,673
Don't look so worried, Chief.

669
00:38:45,706 --> 00:38:47,609
She hasn't beaten us yet.

670
00:38:47,645 --> 00:38:49,639
Yes, sir.

671
00:38:49,683 --> 00:38:52,656
They're still
in Airlock Corridor 6.

672
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:54,820
What could they be doing in
there?

673
00:38:54,862 --> 00:38:56,331
Maybe they've given up.

674
00:38:56,365 --> 00:38:58,768
Sisko would rather die...

675
00:38:58,805 --> 00:39:00,605
which is fine with me.

676
00:39:00,642 --> 00:39:03,513
Oh...

677
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:06,283
they must have taken off
their combadges.

678
00:39:06,389 --> 00:39:08,052
That's all right.

679
00:39:08,094 --> 00:39:09,894
They won't get far.

680
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:12,300
Someone's taking out
our force fields.

681
00:39:15,178 --> 00:39:18,812
Whoever it is knows how
to override the security codes.

682
00:39:23,765 --> 00:39:25,736
Kira to Odo.

683
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,069
Go ahead, Major.

684
00:39:29,111 --> 00:39:31,709
Whose side are you on,
Constable?

685
00:39:31,751 --> 00:39:33,050
Yours, of course.

686
00:39:33,087 --> 00:39:34,990
Really?

687
00:39:35,025 --> 00:39:37,121
Then why are you helping
Sisko escape?

688
00:39:37,163 --> 00:39:39,293
On the contrary.

689
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:42,571
You'll find him trapped
in Cargo Bay 4.

690
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:45,104
Consider it my gift to you.

691
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,642
Oh, my apologies.

692
00:39:46,687 --> 00:39:48,316
We'll see you there.

693
00:39:48,357 --> 00:39:50,088
Kira out.

694
00:39:50,195 --> 00:39:52,166
Well done.

695
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:54,831
You certainly fooled her,
didn't you, Constable?

696
00:39:54,872 --> 00:39:57,343
We're running out of time,
Doctor.

697
00:39:57,379 --> 00:39:58,814
I'm just about finished.

698
00:39:58,849 --> 00:40:01,378
I've set up an ionic
interference signal

699
00:40:01,421 --> 00:40:03,756
in Cargo Bay 4,
calibrated to lock on

700
00:40:03,794 --> 00:40:07,166
to the resonance frequencies
of the telepathic field

701
00:40:07,202 --> 00:40:09,435
and drive it out
of all those affected.

702
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:11,444
And what will happen to it then?

703
00:40:11,545 --> 00:40:13,014
Well, it'll remain suspended

704
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:15,453
as long as the interference
is in effect.

705
00:40:15,555 --> 00:40:16,785
That's all I need to know.

706
00:40:16,825 --> 00:40:17,815
Let's go.

707
00:40:26,148 --> 00:40:27,276
What's wrong?

708
00:40:27,316 --> 00:40:28,284
It's been sealed.

709
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:29,481
I wouldn't do that, sir.

710
00:40:29,523 --> 00:40:30,719
You might run into Kira.

711
00:40:31,604 --> 00:40:34,338
She must have realized we
removed our combadges by now.

712
00:40:41,663 --> 00:40:43,634
It's completely locked down.

713
00:40:43,667 --> 00:40:46,299
Someone's activated
a level-5 security protocol.

714
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:49,837
There's only one other person
on this station besides yourself

715
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:51,577
has that kind of access.

716
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:52,849
Odo!

717
00:40:52,955 --> 00:40:54,755
Relax, Commander.

718
00:40:54,794 --> 00:40:57,961
He'll be here any minute.

719
00:40:58,001 --> 00:41:01,464
So, this is how it all ends.

720
00:41:02,512 --> 00:41:03,879
For you.

721
00:41:05,286 --> 00:41:09,592
You know what disturbs me?

722
00:41:09,629 --> 00:41:12,329
The ingratitude.

723
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:18,977
I offered you my kindness,
my help, my leadership

724
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:22,584
and how do you repay me?

725
00:41:22,627 --> 00:41:24,598
With betrayal.

726
00:41:24,632 --> 00:41:28,505
But you won't
get rid of me so easily.

727
00:41:28,541 --> 00:41:31,982
You see, unlike you,
I understand history.

728
00:41:32,016 --> 00:41:34,648
My name will blaze
across the stars

729
00:41:34,689 --> 00:41:37,628
long after your petty
treacheries have been forgotten.

730
00:41:37,663 --> 00:41:40,363
But you won't be here to see it.

731
00:41:41,672 --> 00:41:43,301
Major, wait!

732
00:41:43,343 --> 00:41:44,607
Glad you two could make it.

733
00:41:44,647 --> 00:41:46,811
Computer, execute Odo One.

734
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,168
Constable?

735
00:42:12,212 --> 00:42:15,550
Everybody grab hold
of something secure.

736
00:42:57,053 --> 00:42:59,753
Welcome back, everybody.

737
00:43:06,676 --> 00:43:11,711
Commander's Log,
Stardate 46924.5.

738
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,817
With nothing to contain it

739
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:16,492
the telepathic matrix
has dispersed in space.

740
00:43:16,533 --> 00:43:18,504
Meanwhile, I'm happy to report

741
00:43:18,538 --> 00:43:21,272
everything and everyone
aboard DS9

742
00:43:21,311 --> 00:43:22,905
has returned to normal.

743
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:35,033
Did you really build that?

744
00:43:35,111 --> 00:43:37,048
Apparently so.

745
00:43:37,116 --> 00:43:38,608
Why?

746
00:43:38,653 --> 00:43:41,022
I have no idea.

747
00:43:42,061 --> 00:43:45,331
I know that none of us
was really responsible

748
00:43:45,368 --> 00:43:49,070
for our actions, but...

749
00:43:49,112 --> 00:43:51,583
I feel I owe you an apology.

750
00:43:51,617 --> 00:43:53,382
For attempted mutiny.

751
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,416
Well...

752
00:43:55,459 --> 00:43:56,928
yes.

753
00:43:58,233 --> 00:44:01,104
I think we'll let it go...

754
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:03,168
this time.
