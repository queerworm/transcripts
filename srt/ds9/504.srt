1
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:07,758
I knew that my paper
was controversial,

2
00:00:07,758 --> 00:00:09,343
but I had no idea
that it would turn

3
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:11,094
the entire conference
upside-down.

4
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:13,973
Believe me, Jake,
panel discussions
between doctors

5
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:16,391
are usually a lot more
civilized than that.

6
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,894
I don't know.
They seemed
polite enough to me.

7
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:20,479
Oh, that was just a veneer.

8
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:22,898
That paper stepped
on quite a few toes,
I can tell you.

9
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:26,067
It's heresy
to even consider the possibility

10
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:28,278
that a prion replication
could be inhibited

11
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,030
by quantum resonance effects.

12
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,491
Aren't you going
to take any notes?

13
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:33,909
Oh, good idea.

14
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:35,870
According to the
so-called experts

15
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,456
it's all a matter
of amino acid re-sequencing
and disulfide shuffling.

16
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,792
Quantum dynamics has nothing
to do with it.

17
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,293
But how can that be?

18
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,170
(<i> thinking</i> ):
<i>I have absolutely no idea</i>

19
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,422
<i>what he's talking about.</i> 
...on a quantum level.

20
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,591
Ah, get this.

21
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:52,427
This is very good.
A few months ago...

22
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,930
<i>If I don't find a way to get</i>
<i>out of doing this article,</i>

23
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,391

<i>is going to be my last.</i>

24
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:01,311

Do you follow?

30
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:11,906
Sort of.

31
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:13,407
Good, because that's the key.

32
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:14,658
The protein anomalies--

33
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:16,493
<i>Who cares about anomalies?</i>

34
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,538
<i>People want stories about</i>

I thought I'd begin

(<i> console beeps</i> )

43
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:42,853
It's a distress call

44
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:45,480
from the Federation colony
on Ajilon Prime.

45
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,857
They're under attack.

46
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,776
The Klingons
have landed troops.

47
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:50,569
So much for
the cease fire.

48
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,279
The main hospital's
been damaged.

49
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,448
They're short on doctors
and running low on supplies.

50
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,366
What are we waiting
for? Let's go.

51
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,243
It's too risky.

52
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,245
The hospital's only
50 kilometers away
from the front line.

53
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:03,791
You put yourself into
dangerous situations
all the time.

54
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,001
Maybe, but that's not the same
as putting<i> you</i> into one.

55
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:07,419
Don't worry about me.

56
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:08,796
You're too young
to die, Jake.

57
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:11,048
I'm<i> 18.</i>

58
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,340
You know
what I mean.

59
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,884
I've been on the station

60
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:16,261
when it was under attack
plenty of times.

61
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,138
I can handle myself.
I'm a Sisko.

62
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,514
There are lives at stake.

63
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,808
These people need you.

64
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,561
(<i> sighs</i> ):
I hope I don't
regret this.

65
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,981
We'll be there
in just under an hour.

66
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:29,399
I can only imagine what
your father's going to say.

67
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,901
He'll understand.

68
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:32,694
I'll get you out of there

69
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,155
as soon
as reinforcements arrive.

70
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,490
Besides,
I wouldn't want you

71
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,908
to miss the deadline
on your story.

72
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,910
Do you think they'd want
a picture of me?

73
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,245
(<i> chuckling</i> )

74
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,123
Anyway, about those
quantum scans

75
00:02:44,123 --> 00:02:45,290
I was telling you about...

76
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,335
<i>"Surgery under Fire."</i>

77
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:49,503
(<i> chuckles to himself</i> )

78
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,338
<i>Now we're talking.</i>

79
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,504
What is it, Quark?

80
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,090
The Chief asked me
to come up

81
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,508
with a decaffeinated
<i>raktajino</i> for Kira.

82
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:03,011
I'm thinking
of marketing it.

83
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,809
Ugh! Ugh!
Oh, that's awful.

84
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,477
Give it a chance.

85
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:11,895
(<i> laughs dryly</i> )

86
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,230
Let me taste it.

87
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,073
<i>Quark.</i>

88
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,825
I did the best I could.

89
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:27,035
The removal of caffeine
from beverages

90
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:30,413
has plagued bartenders and
restaurateurs for centuries.

91
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,833
You can't expect me
to solve it overnight.

92
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,835
Well, I'm not
paying for that.

93
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,920
So much
for "Quark-tajino."

94
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,755
O'BRIEN:
I wanted to get her
off caffeine,

95
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,339
not poison her.

96
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,217
You make me sound
like some kind of addict.

97
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:45,470
She has<i> maybe</i> two
<i>raktajinos</i> a day.

98
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,181
Look, I just don't
want my son to be born

99
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:48,807
with a caffeine
habit, that's all.

100
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:50,892
You're being
ridiculous.

101
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,645
Why does pregnancy
always make<i> men</i>
hysterical?

102
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:56,606
Excuse me. This is not
the first baby I've had.

103
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,234
Excuse me.
<i>Keiko</i> had Molly.

104
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:00,777
It's not up to you
to tell Kira

105
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,196
what she can
and cannot do.

106
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:04,239
She<i> is</i> carrying
his child.

107
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,615
He should have
some say.

108
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,451
As the lessee, he does
have certain rights.

109
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:13,207
Back home, pregnancy
is considered a rental.

110
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:14,749
Rental?
Rental?

111
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,210
(<i> door opens</i> )

112
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,213
(<i> sighs</i> )

113
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,256
Something wrong,
Captain?

114
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,967
I just talked to Dr. Bashir.

115
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,094
He's on his way to Ajilon Prime

116
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,347
to answer a request
for medical assistance.

117
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:29,806
Jake's with him.

118
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,432
According to the
latest reports,

119
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:34,435
Klingon ground troops
have captured two settlements

120
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,937
in the northern
hemisphere.

121
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,231
Half the colonists

122
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:39,482
are still trapped
on the planet,

123
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,985
and there are no ships
in the area to evacuate them.

124
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,778
We're three days
away at best.

125
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,822
The<i> Farragut</i> will get there
the day after tomorrow.

126
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,991
Bashir says that he and Jake
will leave

127
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,160
as soon as the relief teams
are in place.

128
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,996
That means they'll
be home by Thursday.

129
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,331
Doesn't give
you much time

130
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,124
to snoop through
Jake's things.

131
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:10,638
Ready to beam down?

132
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:13,058
No, we can't leave
the runabout in orbit.

133
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:14,642
Not with the Klingons around.

134
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,770
Besides, the colonists
moved what was left

135
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,605
of the medical equipment
underground

136
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,315
when the hospital
was destroyed.

137
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,234
And there's magnesite
in the rock face.

138
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:24,319
There's no way
to transport through it.

139
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,197
I guess we'll have to
find a place to set down.

140
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:29,366
Looks like
there's a clearing

141
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:33,494
about a kilometer away
from the main settlement.

142
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:37,582
Jake... things could get
a little rough down there.

143
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,834
They've got a lot
of wounded.

144
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,502
I'll be all right.

145
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,263
We've got more wounded
coming in!

146
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:53,140
WOMAN:
I need that plasma!

147
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,933
WOMAN 2:
Are you Bashir?

148
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,643
We got a distress call.

149
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,686
Resource said
you were on your way.

150
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,355
Watch it. Watch it!

151
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,107
This is the last IP.

152
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,775
His pulse is thready.

153
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,652
He must be
bleeding somewhere.

154
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,487
We are losing him!

155
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,696
Dr. Kalandra!

156
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,324
Bashir, drop in,
standard triage.

157
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:13,160
Give him
15 milligrams
inaprovaline.

158
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,582
What should I do?

159
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,169
Just keep out
of the way, please.

160
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,089
Get this man
into surgery!

161
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,054
The artery's severed.

162
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,431
Her BP's
bottoming out!

163
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,852
NURSE:
O2, three liters.
One full saline.

164
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,313
Somebody, this man
needs some help!

165
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:42,939
Help me!
Somebody, help me!

166
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,899
I've been hit.

167
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,027
Took a disruptor
blast, real close.

168
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,403
I need that blood plasma!

169
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:49,988
Let's get you
up on the table.

170
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,120
There's nothing we can do.
He's too far gone.

171
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,465
(<i> groaning</i> )

172
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,675
It doesn't look
that bad.

173
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,760
I was stepping
over a Klingon.

174
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,471
I thought
he was dead.

175
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,890
He caught me right
in the foot... ah!

176
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,600
You people better
get out of here

177
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,935
while you still can.

178
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,145
The Klingons...

179
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,604
there's no stopping them.

180
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:26,024
This is a phaser burn.

181
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,734
What are you talking about?!

182
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,403
Just sit tight.

183
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:32,739
We'll... get to you
as soon as we can.

184
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,950
It's not a phaser burn!

185
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,536
It was a Klingon.

186
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,373
You weren't there.

187
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:43,375
You don't know
what it's like.

188
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,380
The Klingons had us pinned down.

189
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,091
We were done for.
We all knew it.

190
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:54,302
Hendriks and Pajal,
they got scared. They ran.

191
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,636
They<i> ran.</i>

192
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,058
Then Sully got hit in the leg...

193
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,645
and the medics
pulled him off the line

194
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,940
and all I could think was...

195
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,111
"I wish I were him."

196
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:15,156
And I took my phaser...

197
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,620
(<i> sobbing</i> )

198
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,372
Oh, God!

199
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:25,208
What did I do
to myself?

200
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,502
What did I do?

201
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:30,004
Find someplace else
to stand.

202
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,465
No problem.

203
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:41,516

00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,070
Give me a hand.

Come on! Come on!

210
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:01,202
I've got to get some plasma
for this guy.

211
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,830
Keep an eye on him for me.

212
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,706
I'll be right back.

213
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,810
Wait, wait, wait.

214
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,437
This way.
Over there.

215
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,608
Watch it.
Watch it!

216
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,818
Nice catch.

217
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,821
Here you are, sir, a nice
private room with a view.

218
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,573
One, two, three.

(<i> grunting</i> )

220
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,160
Well, you can count.
You're hired.

221
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,579
Let's get you dressed.

222
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:49,376
I'd like to try
an aortal graft.

223
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:52,086
All right, there's an extra
surgical table in the back.

224
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,385
He's dead.

225
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:00,178
(<i> sighing</i> )

226
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,972
Come on.
Let's get him out of here.

227
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:41,386
One, two, three...

00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,063
Party's over.

231
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:53,064
So soon?

232
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,608
DOCTOR:
And we were

233
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:55,942
just starting
to have fun.

234
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,902
Since you two aren't busy,

235
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,987
would you mind carrying me
to the nearest replicator

236
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,282
so that I can get
something to eat?

237
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,334
You wanted to see me,
Captain?

238
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,921
Yes. I, uh,
hear you, uh...

239
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,965
took a little trip
to the Infirmary.

240
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,216
(<i> snorts</i> )

241
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,051
I'll be fine.

242
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,554
The only permanent damage
was to my pride.

243
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:26,514
What happened?

244
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,308
Quark wanted me
to keep an eye

245
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,559
on two Yridians

246
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,519
who he suspected
were cheating at dabo.

247
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,730
Turns out he was right.

248
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,315
I could see
from the second level

249
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,857
that one of them was using

250
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,526
a miniature
gravimetric scanner

251
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,529
to predict where the ball
would land on the wheel

252
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,240
and signaling the information
to his partner.

253
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,242
Ingenious. Go on.

254
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,868
Well, I started
down the stairs

255
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,120
to make the arrest.

256
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,413
One of them spotted me.

257
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,915
They bolted.
I pursued.

258
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:57,170
I'm afraid
I got a bit carried away...

259
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,172
And jumped off the stairs.

260
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,048
(<i> grunts</i> )

261
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:05,386
I was planning
to change form in midair

262
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,806
and become a Tarkalean condor.

263
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:11,559
Ah...<i> that</i>
would have been impressive.

264
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,561
I thought so.

265
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,772
It's an understandable mistake.

266
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:19,275
You've been a changeling
longer than you've been a solid.

267
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,860
(<i> snorts</i> )

268
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:25,365
Solid-- I wonder why my people
use that term.

269
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:28,535
Humanoid bodies are so<i> fragile.</i>

270
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,331
Yes, they are.

271
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:39,962
And there are a lot of ways
you can get hurt.

272
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,386
You're worried about Jake.

273
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,055
I'm... sure

274
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:52,767
that Dr. Bashir
is looking after him.

275
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:59,482
It seems... just yesterday
he was five years old...

276
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:05,572
clinging to me, because he'd
just scraped his knee,

277
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:08,032
and I was
the only one in the world

278
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,784
who could make it better.

279
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:11,244
I remember,
sometimes

280
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,413
getting up in the
middle of the night

281
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,039
and slipping into his room,

282
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,166
just to make sure
he was all right...

283
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,754
and I'd sit there
and watch him sleep

284
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:24,424
and I'd think to myself
that no matter what,

285
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:29,303
I wasn't going to let anything
bad happen to this child.

286
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,601
Now he's a sector away
in a war zone,

287
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:37,353
and there's nothing
I can do to protect him.

288
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:40,022
Try not to worry, Captain.

289
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:43,067
It won't do
you or Jake any good.

290
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,778
Can't help it.

291
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:47,363
It comes with the territory.

292
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,783
But Jake is 18 years old.

293
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:52,993
Does your father
still worry about you?

294
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:56,414
Oh,<i> all</i> the time.

295
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:59,333
Ah... I never realized

296
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,002
how stressful it is
to be a parent.

297
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,756
I have to say,
I don't think it's for me.

298
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:09,677
That's your choice, but you
don't know what you're missing.

299
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:12,555
(<i> door chimes</i> )
Yes?

300
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:15,391
We just got word-- the
Klingons have destroyed

301
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,894
the<i> Farragut</i> near
the Lembatta cluster.

302
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,312
What about Ajilon Prime?

303
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,815
Without reinforcements--
Dax, you're with me.

304
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:24,024
We'll leave as soon
as the<i> Defiant</i> is ready.

305
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,622
Here you go.

306
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,290
Thanks.

307
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,041
How you holding up?

308
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,293
Okay.

309
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:45,045
Well, you handled
yourself well today.

310
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,840
I'm impressed.

311
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,758
I'm starved.

312
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:51,928
Think I'll start by making
a lateral incision

313
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:55,139
across the thigh joint.

314
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,683
Uh-oh.
Hang on.

315
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:57,725
Out we go.

316
00:16:58,643 --> 00:16:59,853
His first day?

317
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:00,895
Yeah.

318
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:02,271
Pass the salt.

319
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,942
How do you feel?

320
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,610
Fresh air did me good.

321
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:12,699
You remember that ensign,
the one who shot himself?

322
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,158
How could I forget?

323
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,618
What's going
to happen to him?

324
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,537
Oh, he'll probably be
court-martialed.

325
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,455
He said that some
of the people in his squad

326
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,915
got scared and ran.

327
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,208
It happens.

328
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,835
But they're Starfleet.

329
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:25,503
They've passed psych tests.

330
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,088
They've spent hundreds of hours
in battle simulations.

331
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,424
Simulations can't prepare you
for the real thing.

332
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,968
Nothing can.

333
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:33,928
Some people say
that you don't know

334
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:36,055
what you're really made of
until you've been in battle.

335
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,557
Well, let me tell you, Jake.

336
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,183
There are many
situations in life

337
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,685
which test a person's
character.

338
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,144
Thankfully, most of them

339
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,605
don't involve
death and destruction.

340
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,691
Dr. Kalandra is looking for you.

341
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,818
Something about
that aortal graft you did.

342
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,152
Oh, thanks.

343
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,405
Um... I'll see you later.

344
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:55,282
I put your tray
back in the replicator.

345
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,117
I didn't know
how long you'd be gone.

346
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,870
Me neither.

347
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,121
I think I could
handle some soup.

348
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,758
How is he?

349
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,634
The graft's holding.

350
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,762
Blood throughput
is almost 100 percent.

351
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,680
Nice job.

352
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,098
Thanks.

353
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,725
You have a good team.

354
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:23,352
My O.R. nurse was
as sharp as they come.

355
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:26,105
We do the best we
can, considering...

356
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,357
the circumstances.

357
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:31,694
So, are things
any better for us?

358
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:34,948
Last I heard,
Starfleet had pulled out

359
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:36,950
of the Archanis sector.

360
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,243
Well, the fleet's regrouping
for a counterattack.

361
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:42,538
Do you have any idea
what ships are involved?

362
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,415
We don't get much news here.

363
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:47,543
The Klingons have been jamming
the subspace traffic.

364
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:51,839
I think, um, the<i> Rutledge</i>
and the<i> Tecumseh</i>

365
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,132
are heading
things up.

366
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,094
The<i> Tecumseh.</i>

367
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:59,764
My husband's
the science officer.

368
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,349
Well, believe me,

369
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:05,185
Captain Raymond
is one of the best there is.

370
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:08,397
He saw the<i> Tecumseh</i>
through the Cardassian wars.

371
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:12,276
I don't think he's planning
on losing her now.

372
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,278
No.

373
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,155
I don't suppose he is.

374
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:19,575
Doctor?

375
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,494
They've prepped
the spinal trauma.

376
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,704
We're ready for
you in surgery.
I'll be right there.

377
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,414
They're keeping
you busy.

378
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,666
Yes.

379
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,835
It helps keep
my mind... off things.

380
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,133
It's good to see
you got your appetite back.

381
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:37,468
I have a pretty
strong stomach...

382
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:38,427
most of the time.

383
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,846
Don't worry about it.

384
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,722
Same thing happened
to me my first day.

385
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,725
You know what I heard?

386
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,979
That ship Starfleet
sent--- the<i> Farragut--</i>

387
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:49,563
the Klingons
intercepted it.

388
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:53,026
Starfleet will send
another one, won't they?

389
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,777
Won't be
here for days,

390
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:56,362
and in the meantime,
we're looking at a ground war,

391
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,072
which is just
what the Klingons want,

392
00:19:58,072 --> 00:19:59,907
and according
to a lieutenant I talked to,

393
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,242
they've got so many
transport scramblers on line

394
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,870
that we can't beam
troops anywhere.

395
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,579
What about using hoppers?

396
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,123
He says the Klingons

397
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:09,000
have been shooting them
out of the sky left and right.

398
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,293
Unless something changes,
he figures the Klingons

399
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,587
will take the settlement
the day after tomorrow.

400
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,466
Did you see
all the<i> bat'leth</i> wounds today?

401
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,635
Klingons get mad,

402
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:22,096
they forget about their
disruptors, go hand to hand.

403
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:24,057
If you ask me,
they're looking to get even

404
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:25,349
for what happened on Ganalda IV.

405
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,517
What happened?

406
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:28,019
They had to retreat.

407
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,478
Klingons hate that.

408
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,106
(<i> sighing</i> )

409
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:34,525
At least we don't have to worry
about them in here.

410
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:36,194
Oh, don't
be so sure.

411
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:37,820
Medical personnel
are fair game,

412
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,405
as far as Klingons
are concerned.

413
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,323
They'll even kill wounded
right in their beds.

414
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,784
Think they're giving
them an honorable death.

415
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:49,916
So, how'd you wind up here?

416
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:55,129
I, uh... I'm writing
an article about Dr. Bashir.

417
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:57,173
You're a journalist?

418
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,299
No, not exactly.

419
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,301
What does that mean?

420
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:05,556
I write stories, mostly--
you know, fiction.

421
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:08,893
(<i> thinking</i> ):
<i>I wonder if Kirby knew</i>

422
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:10,978
<i>that the whole time</i>
<i>we were talking,</i>

423
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:14,065
<i>all I could think about was</i>
<i>how close the Klingons were.</i>

424
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:16,316
<i>He didn't seem that worried.</i>

425
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,778
<i>No one else seems</i>
<i>to be losing sleep over it,</i>

426
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,989
<i>so why is it the only thing</i>
<i>I can think about?</i>

427
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,908
<i>I've been on the station</i>
<i>when it was under attack</i>

428
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:26,786
<i>plenty of times,</i>
<i>but somehow the danger</i>

429
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,913
<i>never seemed as real</i>
<i>as it does here.</i>

430
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:31,207
<i>Maybe it's</i>
<i>because I spent all day</i>

431
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:34,210
<i>seeing first-hand what</i>
<i>the Klingons are capable of,</i>

432
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,837
<i>or maybe it's because,</i>
<i>for the first time in my life,</i>

433
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,590
<i>my father's not here</i>
<i>to protect me.</i>

434
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,800
(<i> explosion</i> )

435
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,927
What was that?
The Klingons.

436
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:44,553
They must have taken out
the reactor.

437
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,764
(<i> people calling out orders</i> )

438
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:49,308
Come on, come on!

439
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,684
(<i> gasping</i> )

440
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,561
She's fibrillating.

441
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,521
If we don't get power back soon,
we'll lose half the ward.

442
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,398
KIRBY:
Kidney failure, he's
going into renal shock.

443
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,317
I just talked to Resource.

444
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,360
It's going to be
at least three hours
before we have power.

445
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,571
(<i> sighs</i> )

446
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,657
There must be some portable
generators we could use.

447
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:07,160
They're using them
to keep the shields up

448
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,578
around the settlement.
The runabout.

449
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,205
There's a portable
generator on the runabout.

450
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:13,457
Where is it?
About a kilometer
south of here.

451
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,293
I'll need help
carrying it though.

452
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:16,919
Well, you won't be able
to beam through the shields.

453
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,296
You'll have to take
the east tunnel.

454
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:20,047
That lets out
beyond the perimeter.

455
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,215
I'll show you.

456
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:47,533
We set down
just over that ridge.

457
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,702
Yeah. It looks familiar.

458
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:50,953
Get down!

459
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:54,248
Stay close.

460
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:55,582
And keep
your head low.

461
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:05,425
Whatever happens, one of us
has to get that generator.

462
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,719
Stick with me.

463
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:17,104
Come on, Jake!

464
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:27,740
Jake!

465
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,158
(<i> grunts</i> )

466
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:34,872
(<i> explosions continue</i> )

467
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:54,474
(<i> panting</i> )

468
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,102
(<i> yells</i> )

469
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,805
(<i> groaning</i> )

470
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:39,812
Medkit...

471
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:42,231
over there.

472
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:43,941
Now!

473
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:48,362
Hypo.

474
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:50,197
Sit me up.

475
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:53,742
(<i> groaning</i> )

476
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,328
Do it!

477
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:58,456
I'm not going to die
with my face in the dirt.

478
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:04,170
Okay...

479
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,052
How's your head?

480
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:15,431
Hurts.

481
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:17,183
You're lucky
I didn't kill you.

482
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:19,101
I thought you were
a Klingon.

483
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:20,436
Have you seen any?

484
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:21,854
What?

485
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,147
Klingons!

486
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:25,816
Are there any
patrols around?

487
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:27,901
What about Starfleet?

488
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,820
No.

489
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,613
It's just you and me then.

490
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:34,158
What are you doing
out here anyway?

491
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:36,576
Why'd you leave
the settlement?

492
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:40,789
I, uh... I was outside
when the shelling started.

493
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:44,251
I... I guess I got lost
looking for cover.

494
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,753
Lucky me.

495
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,255
I could use the company.

496
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:52,926
Here... water.

497
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,054
What about you?

498
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,972
Go ahead.

499
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,769
Thanks.

500
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:05,523
Probably would have
leaked out of me anyway.

501
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,902
Don't let me fall over.

502
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:12,821
I want to go out
looking up at the sky,

503
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,823
not at the ground.

504
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,075
Don't worry.

505
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:20,413
You didn't see a crashed
hopper around here,

506
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:21,372
did you?

507
00:26:21,372 --> 00:26:23,040
No.

508
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:25,792
They made it.

509
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,212
Who?

510
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:29,629
My platoon.

511
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,549
The Klingons
had us pinned down.

512
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:33,342
We couldn't beam out

513
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:35,677
'cause they had
a transport scrambler running.

514
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,762
We called for a hopper.

515
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,097
As soon as it set down,

516
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:39,932
the Klingons came after us.

517
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:42,017
CO ordered me and Brice
to lay down cover

518
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,186
so the squad
could get up the ramp.

519
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:46,522
By the time
Brice got in,

520
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:47,856
the Klingons were
practically on top of us.

521
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,400
Hopper was taking
such a pounding,

522
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,026
I didn't think
it'd make it off the ground.

523
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:55,906
You stayed behind on purpose
so they could get away.

524
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:58,242
The hypo... where is it?

525
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,786
It's empty.

526
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:03,080
Figures.

527
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:05,874
I'll get you out of here.

528
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,460
I'll make a stretcher.

529
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,752
With what?

530
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,337
Then I'll carry you.

531
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,214
Kid, you try carrying
me, my guts

532
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:14,508
are going to spill
all over your shoes.

533
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:16,552
But I have to do something.

534
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,471
I've got to try.

535
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:19,597
Forget it.

536
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:20,973
But I have to.

537
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:23,267
That way,
this will all make sense.

538
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:25,227
Maybe I ran for a reason--

539
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:27,563
so I could find you and...
and save your life.

540
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:31,649
Ran?
From the explosions.

541
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:35,070
We had to get to the runabout,
for the generator.

542
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,782
And... the shelling started,
and I couldn't see Dr. Bashir,

543
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:41,952
and the explosions,
they kept getting closer.

544
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,412
I had to get out of there.

545
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:44,788
So I ran.

546
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,082
I ran and I kept running
until I found you.

547
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,376
The doctor-- you left him.

548
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:52,838
It was a mistake.

549
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,548
That's what<i> you</i> call it.

550
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:57,092
I didn't mean for it to happen.

551
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,178
And now you think
bringing me back

552
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,679
is going to make
everything all right.

553
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,558
(<i> coughing</i> )

554
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:06,935
Sorry, kid...

555
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:10,772
life doesn't work like that.

556
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:13,066
(<i> choking</i> )

557
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,762
Benjamin.

558
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:44,390
I'll be right out.

559
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,145
What have you been
doing in there

560
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,522
for three hours?

561
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:53,815
I was tweaking
the pattern buffers

562
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,484
in the replicator systems.

563
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:57,277
Great.

564
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,905
I always thought the coffee
could be a little hotter.

565
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:01,740
I'm just trying
to keep busy.

566
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,534
Is it helping?

567
00:29:03,534 --> 00:29:05,994
No, not really.

568
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:09,331
I wish there was
something I could do.

569
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:10,874
Some way I could
promise you

570
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,876
that everything is
going to be okay.

571
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:15,421
But you can't.
No one can.

572
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:20,384
I know what it's like
to worry about a child.

573
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:25,764
Raifi put Tobin
through hell.

574
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,559
When Neema was six,

575
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,937
she came down
with Rugalan fever.

576
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:35,524
Audrid spent two weeks
in the hospital with her

577
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:39,111
and never left her side.

578
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:42,155
It was hundreds of years ago,

579
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:47,369
and I can still remember how...

580
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:49,705
helpless I felt.

581
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:53,208
I read her
all 17 volumes

582
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,711
of Caster's
<i>Down the River Light,</i>

583
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:59,423
even though I knew
she couldn't hear me.

584
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:05,387
It made me feel
like I was doing something--

585
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:07,264
that we were still connected.

586
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,227
It wasn't...

587
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,480
until much...

588
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:18,858
much after that,

589
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:23,489
that I realized that I
was doing it as much for me

590
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:26,199
as I was doing it for her.

591
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,410
Just to keep busy.

592
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:35,542
So, how did it turn out
with Neema?

593
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,836
She pulled through.

594
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:41,089
Whew. I was hoping you
were going to say that.

595
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,801
Because if this story
had an unhappy ending,

596
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:45,803
I would have never
forgiven you.

597
00:30:45,803 --> 00:30:48,388
(<i> chuckling</i> )

598
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,766
Of course, by the
time she was 21,

599
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:52,434
she wouldn't
even speak to me.

600
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:54,227
For how long?

601
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,979
About eight years.

602
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,397
Do me a favor.

603
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:59,983
Tell me about it
some other time.

604
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:03,779
Right now, all I care about
is seeing Jake.

605
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:07,032
You will, tomorrow,
when we get to Ajilon Prime.

606
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:14,164
You know, Ben,
coffee can never be too hot.

607
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:15,957
Are you sure
you got

608
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,293
the replicator buffers
synchronized?

609
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:21,254
You want to check it
for yourself?

610
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:23,590
I think I will.
Can I borrow
your decoupler?

611
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:26,593
Get your own.

612
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:29,095
I have to check
the sonic shower relays.

613
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:31,473
Good idea.

614
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:51,117
How are you feeling?

615
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:55,664
Jake!

616
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:57,207
Jake, we thought
you were--

617
00:31:57,207 --> 00:31:58,709
I'm okay.

618
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:00,794
This is great.

619
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:02,755
What happened?

620
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:07,509
I got knocked out when we tried
to get to the runabout.

621
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:10,345
Did Dr. Bashir
make it back all right?

622
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,930
He's in IC for the night.

623
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,640
He's got plasma burns
on his arm and shoulder.

624
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,684
I don't know
how he managed,

625
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:17,561
but he carried the generator
back here by himself.

626
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:20,021
We went looking for you right
after the shelling stopped.

627
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:22,691
I mean, there was
hardly anything left
of the runabout.

628
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:26,194
The whole place was nothing
but bomb craters and-and smoke.

629
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,071
We had pretty much
given up hope.

630
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:31,533
I must have wandered off in the
wrong direction when I came to.

631
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:33,869
You are lucky you didn't
get picked up by the Klingons.

632
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:36,705
Word is, they're massing
to attack the compound.

633
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:39,792
You want to see him?

634
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:42,377
No, I should let him rest.

635
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:46,005
He's awake.
I was just in there.

636
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:49,509
Go ahead.
He'll be glad
to see you're okay.

637
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,651
Jake?!

638
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:07,527
Oh!

639
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:10,322
Thank God!

640
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:13,116
I thought
you'd been killed.

641
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,076
Once the shelling
had stopped

642
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,036
and I couldn't
find you,

643
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:19,456
I assumed the worst.

644
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:21,541
I am so sorry.

645
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,001
It's all right.

646
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,377
No...

647
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,171
no, it isn't.

648
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:29,591
I should never have brought
you here in the first place.

649
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:32,886
Now we're stuck here, the
Klingons massing to attack...

650
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:34,304
What was I thinking?!

651
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:36,264
Forget it, okay!

652
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,224
What's done is...
is done.

653
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:43,772
<i>I couldn't stand hearing him</i>
<i>apologize to me like that,</i>

654
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:45,899
<i>not after what I'd done to him.</i>

655
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,527
All right, you two.

656
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:49,903
Visiting hours are over.

657
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:51,738
Let me have
a look at that.

658
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,955
<i>I keep turning it over</i>
<i>in my head--</i>

659
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:04,960
<i>the shelling, losing sight</i>
<i>of Bashir, running--</i>

660
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,379
<i>and I keep trying</i>
<i>to make sense of it all,</i>

661
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,756
<i>to justify what I did.</i>

662
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:14,302
<i>But when it comes down to it,</i>
<i>there's only one explanation.</i>

663
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,847
<i>I'm a coward.</i>

664
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:19,599
<i>Part of me wishes Bashir</i>
<i>had seen me run away</i>

665
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,727
<i>and told everyone the truth.</i>

666
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:23,770
<i>They deserve</i>
<i>to know what I am.</i>

667
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,064
<i>They should know</i>
<i>they can't count on me.</i>

668
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:29,108
<i>That, if the Klingons attack,</i>
<i>I'll run and hide,</i>

669
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,736
<i>just like I did before.</i>

670
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:39,036
Dr. Kalandra asked me
to give this to you.

671
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:40,495
Oh, thanks, Jake.

672
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:41,914
Would you take this
to the patient in G-4?

673
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:44,708
Sure.
Thanks.

674
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,422
Here you go.

675
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:59,639
Maybe I'll get
a job as a cutter.

676
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,683
Could be interesting work.

677
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:04,519
What's a cutter?

678
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,855
You know,
on a mining team.

679
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:09,524
They're the ones who split
asteroids up with phasers

680
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:12,945
so the excavators can
get at what's inside.

681
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:16,239
You got to have good aim,
and no matter what else

682
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,574
you can say about me,

683
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:19,826
you can't say that I
don't have good aim.

684
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:22,788
Because if I hadn't
hit my foot just right,

685
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:25,457
I would have taken
my whole leg off.

686
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:30,503
It's funny.

687
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,672
One minute, your
life's moving along

688
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:35,174
just like you always
thought it would,

689
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:38,303
and the next,
you do something

690
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:40,430
that changes everything,

691
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,432
and that makes you realize

692
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:44,768
you're not who you
thought you were.

693
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,686
At the Academy,
I did really well

694
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,480
in the battle
simulations.

695
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,649
I never had
any problems.

696
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:51,984
But when you're out there,

697
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:54,152
and the live shells
are detonating

698
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,654
all around you,

699
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:57,322
it's a whole
different thing.

700
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:58,907
All you can think about

701
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:01,159
is getting away
from the explosions.

702
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:04,537
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

703
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,623
You know
something?

704
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:08,374
You're the first
person I've met

705
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:10,168
since I've been here
that hasn't made me feel

706
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,671
like I'm taking up
valuable bed space.

707
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:17,092
The way everyone looks at me...

708
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:20,720
I can't stand it.

709
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:26,518
After the court-martial's over,
I'm definitely signing up

710
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:28,061
for the next
mining expedition

711
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:29,896
to the Gamma Quadrant.

712
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:32,315
Maybe there won't be
a court-martial.

713
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,733
You're right.

714
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:36,653
None of us may get
out of here alive.

715
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:39,572
No, I mean Starfleet
could decide

716
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,116
to send you
to counseling instead.

717
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:42,617
I won't go.

718
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,996
I don't deserve
to be in Starfleet.

719
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:49,582
Therapy won't change
what I did.

720
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:53,628
Nothing will.

721
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:59,634
I just wish I had aimed
that phaser a little higher.

722
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:16,902
I saw the report
on Dr. Kalandra's desk.

723
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:19,404
According to Resource,
it's just a matter of time

724
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:21,280
before the Klingons
reach the compound.

725
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,867
I guess that means
I have to decide.

726
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:25,326
Decide what?

727
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:26,703
Whether I'd rather
get hacked to bits

728
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:27,787
or blasted by a disrupter.

729
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,873
A disrupter,
no doubt about it.

730
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:33,251
Every molecule in your body...
vaporized in a flash.

731
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,627
No time to feel pain.

732
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,880
Don't be so sure
about that.

733
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,841
Some people think
it's like being boiled alive.

734
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:41,218
Decapitation has its virtues.

735
00:37:41,218 --> 00:37:43,261
Nice clean blow
with a sharp<i> bat'leth.</i>

736
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,971
The brain lives on

737
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,306
for five, ten seconds
at least.

738
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:51,895
In theory, your headless corpse
could be the last thing you see.

739
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:53,897
You're so negative.

740
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:55,314
I'm just telling you
what I heard.

741
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:56,983
What do you think, Jake?

742
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,985
I think it's not funny.
Well, of course not.

743
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,528
There's nothing funny
about having

744
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:01,571
your throat slit--

745
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:02,614
Cut it out!

746
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,323
I was just kidding.

747
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:06,367
JAKE:
You think this
is some joke.

748
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,161
It's not.
People are dying.

749
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:09,662
And it's all so stupid.

750
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:12,582
This whole stupid war
is such a waste.

751
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:14,375
In ten years, nobody's
going to remember

752
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,501
what anybody did here.

753
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,003
Jake...

754
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,464
Maybe you saved
a hopper full of people.

755
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,758
Maybe you shot yourself
in the foot.

756
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:23,342
No one's going
to remember!

757
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:24,636
Jake!

758
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:28,640
Let's take a walk.

759
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,029
I'm sorry.

760
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:47,826
Look, I know you're
scared, we all are.

761
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:51,454
No... it's not that.

762
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:54,582
What, Jake?
What is it?

763
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,963
I just didn't think
what they were saying was funny.

764
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:03,633
Come on, that's not
what set you off.

765
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:05,844
Something's eating at you.

766
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:07,262
I can see it.

767
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:09,181
I don't know
what you're talking about.

768
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:10,765
Ever since you came back here,

769
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,976
you've been walking around
looking miserable.

770
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,021
Leave me alone.

771
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:17,147
Jake...

772
00:39:17,147 --> 00:39:19,065
Leave me alone.

773
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:22,235
All right,
if that's what you want.

774
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:25,697
But if you want to talk,
you know where to find me.

775
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:10,742
(<i> explosions</i> )

776
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,789
What's going on?

777
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,291
Are they inside the compound?

778
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:20,252
Everybody, listen!
What's going on?

779
00:40:20,252 --> 00:40:22,337
Listen!
We're evacuating.

780
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:23,838
We're taking the patients

781
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,424
out through the north tunnel
to the surface.

782
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,426
A hopper will take us
down the peninsula

783
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,011
to the base at Tanandra Bay.

784
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:31,596
That tunnel is almost
two kilometers long.

785
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,181
We have over 70
patients to move.

786
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:34,640
Do you know how long
that's going to take?

787
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,768
Resource is sending
a security detail

788
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,811
to defend the hospital
and give us

789
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,897
time to evacuate.
We can do this.

790
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,275
We have to keep calm,
focus on our jobs.

791
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:44,734
Those people out
there need us.

792
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:46,819
Yes. Let's move.
Come on.

793
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,821
Go.

794
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,576
(<i> explosions</i> )

795
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,706
Give me a hand!

796
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,041
Keep moving!

797
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,584
Two guards?!
Is that it?!

798
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:04,129
The others are out
defending the perimeter.

799
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:05,713
KIRBY:
Great. One's leaving.

800
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,049
We're going
someplace safe, all right.

801
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:09,008
Come on.

802
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,760
(<i> explosions</i> )

803
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:31,072
They're coming! Let's go!

804
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:32,324
Move! Move!

805
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:33,325
Come on, let's go!

806
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:34,533
Anyone left
back there?!

807
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:35,534
No.

808
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:36,744
Go! Go!

809
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:41,707
Get down!

810
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:15,200
(<i> both yelling</i> )

811
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,202
(<i> yelling</i> )

812
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:25,835
BASHIR:
Jake... look who's here.

813
00:42:28,338 --> 00:42:29,672
Dad...

814
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,257
Don't move.

815
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:33,134
Let Dr. Bashir check
you for injuries.

816
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:35,345
What happened?

817
00:42:35,345 --> 00:42:36,888
I came back for you

818
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:38,723
when I realized you
weren't on the hopper.

819
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:41,017
The cease-fire has
been reinstated.

820
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:43,853
The Klingons
are pulling out.
It's over.

821
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:45,313
The timing could have been
a little bit better,

822
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:48,483
but... uh, he seems
to be all right.

823
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:52,028
Sealing the entranceway
was a risky thing to do.

824
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:55,490
You nearly brought
the whole ceiling
down on yourself.

825
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,534
We never would have got
those patients out alive

826
00:42:57,534 --> 00:42:58,659
if you hadn't
done it.

827
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,370
You're a hero.

828
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,831
JAKE:
<i>More than anything,</i>

829
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:06,667
<i>I wanted to believe</i>
<i>what he was saying,</i>

830
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,253
<i>but the truth is,</i>

831
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:10,213
<i>I was just as scared</i>
<i>in the hospital</i>

832
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:12,382
<i>as I'd been when we went</i>
<i>for the generator,</i>

833
00:43:12,382 --> 00:43:15,718
<i>so scared</i>
<i>that all I could think about</i>

834
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:18,513
<i>was doing whatever it took</i>
<i>to stay alive.</i>

835
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:20,723
<i>Once that meant running away,</i>

836
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:23,268
<i>and once it meant</i>
<i>picking up a phaser.</i>

837
00:43:23,268 --> 00:43:25,311
<i>The battle of Ajilon Prime</i>

838
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:28,231
<i>will probably be remembered</i>
<i>as a pointless skirmish,</i>

839
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:31,192
<i>but I'll always remember it</i>
<i>as something more--</i>

840
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:32,860
<i>as the place I learned</i>

841
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,987
<i>that the line</i>
<i>between courage and cowardice</i>

842
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,574
<i>is a lot thinner</i>
<i>than most people believe.</i>

843
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:44,247
I wasn't sure whether
to show it to you or not.

844
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:46,541
Hmm.

845
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:48,876
Anyone who's
been in battle

846
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,670
would recognize
himself in this,

847
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:54,132
but most of us wouldn't
care to admit it.

848
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:59,053
It takes courage
to look inside yourself,

849
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,721
and even more courage

850
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:03,141
to write it for
other people to see.

851
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:07,437
I'm proud of you, son.
