1
00:00:06,138 --> 00:00:08,165
I knew that my paper
was controversial

2
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,146
but I had no idea
that it would turn

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,013
the entire conference
upside-down.

4
00:00:12,051 --> 00:00:15,149
Believe me, Jake, panel
discussions between doctors

5
00:00:15,191 --> 00:00:17,184
are usually a lot
more civilized than that.

6
00:00:17,297 --> 00:00:18,196
I don't know.

7
00:00:18,299 --> 00:00:19,528
They seemed polite enough to me.

8
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:20,900
Oh, that was just a veneer.

9
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:24,001
That paper stepped on quite
a few toes, I can tell you.

10
00:00:24,045 --> 00:00:26,915
It's heresy
to even consider the possibility

11
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:29,217
that a prion replication
could be inhibited

12
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:30,918
by quantum resonance effects.

13
00:00:30,959 --> 00:00:32,895
Aren't you going
to take any notes?

14
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:35,026
Oh, good idea.

15
00:00:35,069 --> 00:00:36,595
According
to the so-called experts

16
00:00:36,639 --> 00:00:38,575
it's all a matter
of amino acid re-sequencing

17
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:39,804
and disulfide shuffling.

18
00:00:39,846 --> 00:00:42,181
Quantum dynamics
has nothing to do with it.

19
00:00:42,218 --> 00:00:43,710
But how can that be?

20
00:00:43,754 --> 00:00:46,852
<i>I have absolutely no idea</i>
<i>what he's talking about.</i>

21
00:00:46,894 --> 00:00:47,919
...on a quantum level.

22
00:00:47,963 --> 00:00:50,059
Ah, get this.

23
00:00:50,102 --> 00:00:51,070
This is very good.

24
00:00:51,104 --> 00:00:52,835
A few months ago...

25
00:00:52,874 --> 00:00:55,209
<i>If I don't find a way to get</i>
<i>out of doing this article</i>

26
00:00:55,246 --> 00:00:57,717
<i>my first writing assignment</i>
<i>is going to be my last.</i>

27
00:00:57,752 --> 00:01:01,591
<i>Maybe if I write to the</i> Journal
<i>and explain.</i>

28
00:01:01,627 --> 00:01:02,926
<i>"Dear Editors, thank you</i>

29
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:05,059
<i>"for the confidence</i>
<i>you expressed in me</i>

30
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:07,698
<i>"by accepting my proposed</i>
<i>profile of Dr. Bashir.</i>

31
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:08,969
<i>Unfortunately..."</i>

32
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,000
Do you follow?

33
00:01:11,081 --> 00:01:12,242
Sort of.

34
00:01:12,351 --> 00:01:13,650
Good, because that's the key.

35
00:01:13,686 --> 00:01:14,881
The protein anomalies...

36
00:01:14,923 --> 00:01:16,654
<i>Who cares about anomalies?</i>

37
00:01:16,693 --> 00:01:19,757
<i>People want stories about</i>
<i>things they can relate to:</i>

38
00:01:19,801 --> 00:01:21,668
<i>Life and death, good and evil.</i>

39
00:01:21,704 --> 00:01:25,577
<i>An outbreak of Cartalian fever</i>
<i>would be just the thing.</i>

40
00:01:25,613 --> 00:01:28,677
<i>"The brave doctor</i>
<i>battles the deadly virus. "

41
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:31,886
<i>Listen to me... I'm actually</i>
<i>rooting for a plague.</i>

42
00:01:31,927 --> 00:01:34,228
...quantum-scanning
each and every peptide bond

43
00:01:34,265 --> 00:01:36,463
I thought I'd begin
to make some kind of...

44
00:01:41,347 --> 00:01:43,283
It's a distress call

45
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:45,756
from the Federation colony
on Ajilon Prime.

46
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:47,090
They're under attack.

47
00:01:47,126 --> 00:01:49,096
The Klingons have landed troops.

48
00:01:49,131 --> 00:01:51,124
So much for the cease-fire.

49
00:01:51,169 --> 00:01:52,638
The main hospital's
been damaged.

50
00:01:52,672 --> 00:01:55,109
They're short on doctors
and running low on supplies.

51
00:01:55,144 --> 00:01:57,137
What are we waiting for?
Let's go.

52
00:01:57,182 --> 00:01:58,207
It's too risky.

53
00:01:58,252 --> 00:01:59,721
The hospital's
only 50 kilometers away

54
00:01:59,755 --> 00:02:00,984
from the front line.

55
00:02:01,024 --> 00:02:02,960
You put yourself
into dangerous situations

56
00:02:02,995 --> 00:02:04,294
all the time.

57
00:02:04,331 --> 00:02:06,632
Maybe, but that's not the same
as putting you into one.

58
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:07,969
Don't worry about me.

59
00:02:08,006 --> 00:02:09,475
You're too young to die, Jake.

60
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:10,636
I'm 18.

61
00:02:11,681 --> 00:02:12,876
You know what I mean.

62
00:02:12,917 --> 00:02:14,511
I've been on the station

63
00:02:14,554 --> 00:02:16,855
when it was under attack
plenty of times.

64
00:02:16,892 --> 00:02:18,725
I can handle myself.
I'm a Sisko.

65
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,232
There are lives at stake.

66
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:21,633
These people need you.

67
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:25,306
I hope I don't regret this.

68
00:02:25,344 --> 00:02:27,337
We'll be there
in just under an hour.

69
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:30,182
I can only imagine what
your father's going to say.

70
00:02:30,221 --> 00:02:31,554
He'll understand.

71
00:02:31,592 --> 00:02:33,357
I'll get you out of there

72
00:02:33,429 --> 00:02:35,798
as soon
as reinforcements arrive.

73
00:02:35,834 --> 00:02:37,029
Besides, I wouldn't want you

74
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,596
to miss the deadline
on your story.

75
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,542
Do you think they'd want
a picture of me?

76
00:02:42,882 --> 00:02:44,715
Anyway,
about those quantum scans

77
00:02:44,753 --> 00:02:45,880
I was telling you about...

78
00:02:45,923 --> 00:02:49,090
<i>"Surgery under Fire."</i>

79
00:02:50,332 --> 00:02:52,097
<i>Now we're talking.</i>

80
00:04:55,498 --> 00:04:57,058
What is it, Quark?

81
00:04:57,101 --> 00:04:58,730
The Chief asked me to come up

82
00:04:58,772 --> 00:05:01,175
with a decaffeinated
<i>raktajino</i> for Kira.

83
00:05:01,211 --> 00:05:03,238
I'm thinking of marketing it.

84
00:05:06,288 --> 00:05:07,723
Ugh! Ugh!

85
00:05:07,758 --> 00:05:09,057
Oh, that's awful.

86
00:05:09,094 --> 00:05:10,563
Give it a chance.

87
00:05:11,934 --> 00:05:13,403
Let me taste it.

88
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,050
Quark.

89
00:05:23,092 --> 00:05:24,891
I did the best I could.

90
00:05:24,929 --> 00:05:27,093
The removal of caffeine
from beverages

91
00:05:27,134 --> 00:05:30,437
has plagued bartenders and
restaurateurs for centuries.

92
00:05:30,475 --> 00:05:32,912
You can't expect me
to solve it overnight.

93
00:05:32,947 --> 00:05:34,883
Well, I'm not paying for that.

94
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,014
So much for "Quark-tajino."

95
00:05:37,056 --> 00:05:39,049
I wanted to get her
off caffeine

96
00:05:39,093 --> 00:05:40,061
not poison her.

97
00:05:40,096 --> 00:05:41,121
You make me sound

98
00:05:41,232 --> 00:05:42,633
like some kind of addict.

99
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:45,904
She has maybe
two <i>raktajinos</i> a day.

100
00:05:45,943 --> 00:05:47,674
Look, I just don't
want my son to be born

101
00:05:47,713 --> 00:05:49,307
with a caffeine habit,
that's all.

102
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,480
You're being ridiculous.

103
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:53,992
Why does pregnancy
always make men hysterical?

104
00:05:54,026 --> 00:05:56,930
Excuse me. This is not
the first baby I've had.

105
00:05:56,967 --> 00:05:59,530
Excuse me.
Keiko had Molly.

106
00:05:59,572 --> 00:06:01,132
It's not up to you
to tell Kira

107
00:06:01,176 --> 00:06:02,543
what she can and cannot do.

108
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:04,572
She is carrying his child.

109
00:06:04,617 --> 00:06:05,881
He should have some say.

110
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,984
As the lessee, he does
have certain rights.

111
00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:13,566
Back home, pregnancy
is considered a rental.

112
00:06:13,603 --> 00:06:15,038
- Rental?
- Rental?

113
00:06:19,616 --> 00:06:21,643
Something wrong, Captain?

114
00:06:21,687 --> 00:06:24,158
I just talked to Dr. Bashir.

115
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,321
He's on his way to Ajilon Prime

116
00:06:26,364 --> 00:06:29,063
to answer a request
for medical assistance.

117
00:06:29,103 --> 00:06:30,071
Jake's with him.

118
00:06:30,106 --> 00:06:31,301
According to the latest reports

119
00:06:31,342 --> 00:06:34,838
Klingon ground troops
have captured two settlements

120
00:06:34,883 --> 00:06:36,375
in the northern hemisphere.

121
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,757
Half the colonists
are still trapped on the planet

122
00:06:39,794 --> 00:06:42,322
and there are no ships
in the area to evacuate them.

123
00:06:42,366 --> 00:06:44,165
We're three days away at best.

124
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:46,196
The <i>Farragut</i> will get there
the day after tomorrow.

125
00:06:46,275 --> 00:06:48,371
Bashir says that he and Jake
will leave

126
00:06:48,413 --> 00:06:50,680
as soon as the relief teams
are in place.

127
00:06:50,718 --> 00:06:53,417
That means they'll be home
by Thursday.

128
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:56,590
Doesn't give you much time
to snoop through Jake's things.

129
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,537
Ready to beam down?

130
00:07:10,573 --> 00:07:12,806
No, we can't leave
the runabout in orbit.

131
00:07:12,845 --> 00:07:14,508
Not with the Klingons around.

132
00:07:14,549 --> 00:07:16,610
Besides, the colonists
moved what was left

133
00:07:16,653 --> 00:07:18,452
of the medical equipment
underground

134
00:07:18,491 --> 00:07:20,085
when the hospital was destroyed.

135
00:07:20,128 --> 00:07:22,030
And there's magnesite
in the rock face.

136
00:07:22,065 --> 00:07:24,161
There's no way
to transport through it.

137
00:07:24,203 --> 00:07:27,199
I guess we'll have to
find a place to set down.

138
00:07:27,243 --> 00:07:29,304
Looks like there's a clearing

139
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:33,221
about a kilometer away
from the main settlement.

140
00:07:33,256 --> 00:07:37,527
Jake... things could get
a little rough down there.

141
00:07:37,565 --> 00:07:39,729
They've got a lot of wounded.

142
00:07:39,771 --> 00:07:41,604
I'll be all right.

143
00:07:48,757 --> 00:07:51,251
We've got more wounded
coming in!

144
00:07:51,296 --> 00:07:53,163
I need that plasma!

145
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,965
Are you Bashir?

146
00:07:55,004 --> 00:07:56,564
We got a distress call.

147
00:07:56,607 --> 00:07:58,600
Resource said
you were on your way.

148
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:00,309
Watch it. Watch it!

149
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:02,046
This is the last IP.

150
00:08:02,086 --> 00:08:03,680
His pulse is thready.

151
00:08:03,723 --> 00:08:05,488
He must be bleeding somewhere.

152
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,394
We are losing him!

153
00:08:07,431 --> 00:08:08,558
Dr. Kalandra!

154
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:10,195
Bashir, drop in,
standard triage.

155
00:08:10,238 --> 00:08:13,108
Give him 15 milligrams
inaprovaline.

156
00:08:18,255 --> 00:08:19,554
What should I do?

157
00:08:19,592 --> 00:08:22,120
Just keep out
of the way, please.

158
00:08:24,034 --> 00:08:26,061
Get this man into surgery!

159
00:08:32,052 --> 00:08:33,111
The artery's severed.

160
00:08:33,154 --> 00:08:34,349
Her BP's bottoming out!

161
00:08:36,161 --> 00:08:37,630
O2, three liters.
One full saline.

162
00:08:39,368 --> 00:08:41,338
Somebody, this man
needs some help!

163
00:08:41,373 --> 00:08:42,808
Help me!
Somebody, help me!

164
00:08:42,843 --> 00:08:44,836
I've been hit.

165
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,850
Took a disruptor blast,
real close.

166
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:48,411
I need that blood plasma!

167
00:08:48,454 --> 00:08:50,014
Let's get you up on the table.

168
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:55,696
There's nothing we can do.

169
00:08:55,737 --> 00:08:57,138
He's too far gone.

170
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,629
It doesn't look that bad.

171
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,640
I was stepping over a Klingon.

172
00:09:12,674 --> 00:09:14,473
I thought he was dead.

173
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,813
He caught me right
in the foot... ah!

174
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,481
You people better
get out of here

175
00:09:19,523 --> 00:09:20,787
while you still can.

176
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:21,987
The Klingons...

177
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:23,521
there's no stopping them.

178
00:09:23,565 --> 00:09:26,059
This is a phaser burn.

179
00:09:26,105 --> 00:09:27,597
What are you talking about?!

180
00:09:27,641 --> 00:09:29,270
Just sit tight.

181
00:09:29,311 --> 00:09:32,648
We'll... get to you
as soon as we can.

182
00:09:32,685 --> 00:09:35,817
It's not a phaser burn!

183
00:09:35,859 --> 00:09:37,658
It was a Klingon.

184
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,303
You weren't there.

185
00:09:41,338 --> 00:09:43,331
You don't know what it's like.

186
00:09:46,449 --> 00:09:48,613
The Klingons had us pinned down.

187
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:49,849
We were done for.

188
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,189
We all knew it.

189
00:09:51,226 --> 00:09:54,495
Hendriks and Pajal,
they got scared. They ran.

190
00:09:54,534 --> 00:09:55,935
They ran.

191
00:09:57,941 --> 00:10:00,276
Then Sully got hit in the leg...

192
00:10:02,084 --> 00:10:04,783
and the medics
pulled him off the line

193
00:10:04,823 --> 00:10:07,192
and all I could think was...

194
00:10:09,332 --> 00:10:11,325
"I wish I were him."

195
00:10:12,473 --> 00:10:15,571
And I took my phaser...

196
00:10:20,991 --> 00:10:22,654
Oh, God!

197
00:10:22,695 --> 00:10:25,462
What did I do to myself?

198
00:10:25,502 --> 00:10:27,700
What did I do?

199
00:10:27,739 --> 00:10:30,302
Find someplace else to stand.

200
00:10:30,346 --> 00:10:31,838
No problem.

201
00:10:38,196 --> 00:10:41,727
<i>"Triage...</i>
<i>the sorting of the wounded...</i>

202
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:44,298
<i>forces decisions that..."</i>

203
00:10:44,342 --> 00:10:48,043
<i>I got to get a grip... focus.</i>

204
00:10:48,084 --> 00:10:51,023
<i>"...decisions that test</i>
<i>what it means to be a doctor. "

205
00:10:51,057 --> 00:10:52,856
Hey, you!

206
00:10:52,895 --> 00:10:54,364
Give me a hand.

207
00:10:56,236 --> 00:10:58,503
Come on! Come on!

208
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,444
I've got to get some plasma
for this guy.

209
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,951
Keep an eye on him for me.

210
00:11:03,986 --> 00:11:05,215
I'll be right back.

211
00:11:24,765 --> 00:11:26,394
Wait, wait, wait.

212
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:27,768
This way.
Over there.

213
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:31,200
Watch it.
Watch it!

214
00:11:32,448 --> 00:11:34,418
Nice catch.

215
00:11:34,452 --> 00:11:37,584
Here you are, sir, a nice
private room with a view.

216
00:11:37,626 --> 00:11:39,186
One, two, three.

217
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:41,935
Well, you can count.

218
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:42,937
You're hired.

219
00:11:42,972 --> 00:11:44,464
Let's get you dressed.

220
00:11:48,317 --> 00:11:49,980
I'd like to try
an aortal graft.

221
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,821
All right, there's an extra
surgical table in the back.

222
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,696
He's dead.

223
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,635
Come on.

224
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,273
Let's get him out of here.

225
00:12:39,863 --> 00:12:41,492
One, two, three...

226
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,189
Party's over.

227
00:12:52,257 --> 00:12:53,350
So soon?

228
00:12:53,393 --> 00:12:56,194
And we were just starting
to have fun.

229
00:12:56,232 --> 00:12:57,667
Since you two aren't busy

230
00:12:57,702 --> 00:13:00,196
would you mind carrying me
to the nearest replicator

231
00:13:00,308 --> 00:13:02,541
so that I can get
something to eat?

232
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:13,499
You wanted to see me,
Captain?

233
00:13:13,537 --> 00:13:17,170
Yes. I, uh, hear you, uh...

234
00:13:17,212 --> 00:13:19,114
took a little trip
to the Infirmary.

235
00:13:20,385 --> 00:13:22,014
I'll be fine.

236
00:13:22,055 --> 00:13:24,822
The only permanent damage
was to my pride.

237
00:13:24,862 --> 00:13:26,593
What happened?

238
00:13:26,633 --> 00:13:29,629
Quark wanted me to keep an eye
on two Yridians

239
00:13:29,672 --> 00:13:31,768
who he suspected
were cheating at dabo.

240
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,780
Turns out he was right.

241
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:35,374
I could see
from the second level

242
00:13:35,418 --> 00:13:36,887
that one of them was using

243
00:13:36,922 --> 00:13:38,619
a miniature
gravimetric scanner

244
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:41,632
to predict where the ball
would land on the wheel

245
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:44,399
and signaling the information
to his partner.

246
00:13:44,438 --> 00:13:46,408
Ingenious. Go on.

247
00:13:46,443 --> 00:13:48,242
Well, I started
down the stairs

248
00:13:48,314 --> 00:13:49,247
to make the arrest.

249
00:13:49,316 --> 00:13:50,808
One of them spotted me.

250
00:13:50,852 --> 00:13:51,911
They bolted.

251
00:13:51,955 --> 00:13:53,048
I pursued.

252
00:13:53,091 --> 00:13:57,624
I'm afraid
I got a bit carried away...

253
00:13:57,667 --> 00:13:59,603
And jumped off the stairs.

254
00:14:01,576 --> 00:14:05,711
I was planning
to change form in midair

255
00:14:05,752 --> 00:14:08,315
and become a Tarkalean condor.

256
00:14:08,358 --> 00:14:12,059
Ah... that
would have been impressive.

257
00:14:12,099 --> 00:14:14,069
I thought so.

258
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:16,097
It's an understandable mistake.

259
00:14:16,141 --> 00:14:19,842
You've been a changeling
longer than you've been a solid.

260
00:14:21,219 --> 00:14:25,889
Solid... I wonder why my people
use that term.

261
00:14:25,929 --> 00:14:29,027
Humanoid bodies are so fragile.

262
00:14:31,976 --> 00:14:33,878
Yes, they are.

263
00:14:36,586 --> 00:14:40,584
And there are a lot of ways
you can get hurt.

264
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,937
You're worried about Jake.

265
00:14:48,245 --> 00:14:49,055
I'm... sure

266
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:52,628
that Dr. Bashir
is looking after him.

267
00:14:52,662 --> 00:14:59,542
It seems... just yesterday
he was five years old...

268
00:15:00,981 --> 00:15:05,446
clinging to me, because he'd
just scraped his knee

269
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,961
and I was
the only one in the world

270
00:15:07,996 --> 00:15:09,795
who could make it better.

271
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,200
I remember, sometimes

272
00:15:11,236 --> 00:15:13,469
getting up
in the middle of the night

273
00:15:13,508 --> 00:15:15,034
and slipping into his room

274
00:15:15,078 --> 00:15:17,174
just to make sure
he was all right...

275
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:20,621
and I'd sit there
and watch him sleep

276
00:15:20,657 --> 00:15:24,392
and I'd think to myself
that no matter what

277
00:15:24,432 --> 00:15:29,375
I wasn't going to let anything
bad happen to this child.

278
00:15:32,216 --> 00:15:34,517
Now he's a sector away
in a war zone

279
00:15:34,554 --> 00:15:37,253
and there's nothing
I can do to protect him.

280
00:15:37,293 --> 00:15:40,060
Try not to worry, Captain.

281
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,073
It won't do you or Jake
any good.

282
00:15:43,106 --> 00:15:44,803
Can't help it.

283
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:47,474
It comes with the territory.

284
00:15:47,516 --> 00:15:49,646
But Jake is 18 years old.

285
00:15:49,687 --> 00:15:52,990
Does your father
still worry about you?

286
00:15:53,028 --> 00:15:56,524
Oh, all the time.

287
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:59,303
Ah... I never realized

288
00:15:59,342 --> 00:16:01,939
how stressful it is
to be a parent.

289
00:16:01,981 --> 00:16:05,045
I have to say,
I don't think it's for me.

290
00:16:05,088 --> 00:16:10,293
That's your choice, but you
don't know what you're missing.

291
00:16:11,803 --> 00:16:13,032
Yes?

292
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:15,703
We just got word...
the Klingons have destroyed

293
00:16:15,744 --> 00:16:18,215
the <i>Farragut</i> near
the Lembatta cluster.

294
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,844
What about Ajilon Prime?

295
00:16:19,887 --> 00:16:20,877
Without reinforcements...

296
00:16:20,923 --> 00:16:22,222
Dax, you're with me.

297
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:23,922
We'll leave as soon
as the <i>Defiant</i> is ready.

298
00:16:36,891 --> 00:16:38,224
Here you go.

299
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,752
Thanks.

300
00:16:39,797 --> 00:16:41,596
How you holding up?

301
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:42,796
Okay.

302
00:16:42,838 --> 00:16:45,605
Well, you handled
yourself well today.

303
00:16:45,643 --> 00:16:46,942
I'm impressed.

304
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,778
I'm starved.

305
00:16:48,817 --> 00:16:52,052
Think I'll start by making
a lateral incision

306
00:16:52,091 --> 00:16:55,462
across the thigh joint.

307
00:16:55,499 --> 00:16:56,866
Uh-oh.
Hang on.

308
00:16:56,902 --> 00:16:57,892
Out we go.

309
00:16:58,906 --> 00:16:59,965
His first day?

310
00:17:00,042 --> 00:17:01,067
Yeah.

311
00:17:01,111 --> 00:17:02,478
Pass the salt.

312
00:17:04,485 --> 00:17:06,011
How do you feel?

313
00:17:06,055 --> 00:17:07,752
Fresh air did me good.

314
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:12,863
You remember that Ensign,
the one who shot himself?

315
00:17:12,904 --> 00:17:14,271
How could I forget?

316
00:17:14,307 --> 00:17:15,708
What's going to happen to him?

317
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,542
Oh, he'll probably be
court-martialed.

318
00:17:17,581 --> 00:17:19,642
He said that some of the people
in his squad

319
00:17:19,685 --> 00:17:21,052
got scared and ran.

320
00:17:21,088 --> 00:17:22,283
It happens.

321
00:17:22,324 --> 00:17:23,953
But they're Starfleet.

322
00:17:24,061 --> 00:17:25,587
They've passed psych-tests.

323
00:17:25,631 --> 00:17:28,296
They've spent hundreds of hours
in battle simulations.

324
00:17:28,337 --> 00:17:30,968
Simulations can't prepare you
for the real thing.

325
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,171
Nothing can.

326
00:17:32,213 --> 00:17:33,682
Some people say
that you don't know

327
00:17:33,716 --> 00:17:36,153
what you're really made of
until you've been in battle.

328
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:37,851
Well, let me tell you, Jake.

329
00:17:37,892 --> 00:17:39,384
There are many
situations in life

330
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:40,864
which test a person's
character.

331
00:17:40,899 --> 00:17:41,992
Thankfully, most of them

332
00:17:42,068 --> 00:17:43,765
don't involve
death and destruction.

333
00:17:45,877 --> 00:17:47,938
Dr. Kalandra is looking for you.

334
00:17:47,981 --> 00:17:50,008
Something about
that aortal graft you did.

335
00:17:50,086 --> 00:17:51,350
Oh, thanks.

336
00:17:51,388 --> 00:17:53,518
Um... I'll see you later.

337
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,656
I put your tray
back in the replicator.

338
00:17:55,697 --> 00:17:57,724
I didn't know
how long you'd be gone.

339
00:17:57,769 --> 00:17:59,033
Me neither.

340
00:17:59,105 --> 00:18:00,665
I think I could
handle some soup.

341
00:18:10,697 --> 00:18:11,996
How is he?

342
00:18:12,067 --> 00:18:13,798
The graft's holding.

343
00:18:13,837 --> 00:18:16,001
Blood throughput
is almost 100 percent.

344
00:18:16,076 --> 00:18:17,943
Nice job.

345
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,279
Thanks.

346
00:18:19,317 --> 00:18:20,410
You have a good team.

347
00:18:20,452 --> 00:18:23,584
My O.R. Nurse was
as sharp as they come.

348
00:18:23,626 --> 00:18:26,530
We do the best we can,
considering...

349
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:28,592
the circumstances.

350
00:18:28,637 --> 00:18:31,804
So, are things
any better for us?

351
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:35,181
Last I heard,
Starfleet had pulled out

352
00:18:35,218 --> 00:18:37,314
of the Archanis sector.

353
00:18:37,356 --> 00:18:39,623
Well, the fleet's regrouping
for a counterattack.

354
00:18:41,298 --> 00:18:42,927
Do you have any idea
what ships are involved?

355
00:18:42,968 --> 00:18:44,597
We don't get much news here.

356
00:18:44,639 --> 00:18:47,771
The Klingons have been jamming
the subspace traffic.

357
00:18:47,812 --> 00:18:52,220
I think, um, the <i>Rutledge</i>
and the <i>Tecumseh</i>

358
00:18:52,255 --> 00:18:53,588
are heading things up.

359
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:56,461
The <i>Tecumseh.</i>

360
00:18:56,498 --> 00:19:00,269
My husband's
the Science Officer.

361
00:19:01,275 --> 00:19:02,539
Well, believe me

362
00:19:02,577 --> 00:19:05,447
Captain Raymond
is one of the best there is.

363
00:19:05,484 --> 00:19:08,651
He saw the <i>Tecumseh</i>
through the Cardassian wars.

364
00:19:08,692 --> 00:19:12,656
I don't think he's planning
on losing her now.

365
00:19:12,701 --> 00:19:14,500
No.

366
00:19:14,538 --> 00:19:16,531
I don't suppose he is.

367
00:19:18,412 --> 00:19:19,813
Doctor?

368
00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:21,751
They've prepped
the spinal trauma.

369
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:22,913
We're ready for you in surgery.

370
00:19:22,956 --> 00:19:24,083
I'll be right there.

371
00:19:24,158 --> 00:19:25,752
They're keeping you busy.

372
00:19:25,795 --> 00:19:26,785
Yes.

373
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,303
It helps keep my mind...
off things.

374
00:19:32,945 --> 00:19:35,382
It's good to see
you got your appetite back.

375
00:19:35,417 --> 00:19:37,820
I have a pretty
strong stomach...

376
00:19:37,856 --> 00:19:38,846
most of the time.

377
00:19:38,891 --> 00:19:40,018
Don't worry about it.

378
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,053
Same thing happened
to me my first day.

379
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,934
You know what I heard?

380
00:19:44,971 --> 00:19:48,342
That ship Starfleet sent... -
the <i>Farragut...</i>

381
00:19:48,378 --> 00:19:49,904
the Klingons intercepted it.

382
00:19:51,118 --> 00:19:53,419
Starfleet will send
another one, won't they?

383
00:19:53,456 --> 00:19:55,016
Won't be here for days

384
00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:56,995
and in the meantime,
we're looking at a ground war

385
00:19:57,031 --> 00:19:58,432
which is just
what the Klingons want

386
00:19:58,467 --> 00:20:00,334
and according
to a Lieutenant I talked to

387
00:20:00,372 --> 00:20:02,605
they've got so many
transport scramblers on line

388
00:20:02,643 --> 00:20:04,169
that we can't beam
troops anywhere.

389
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:05,943
What about using hoppers?

390
00:20:05,983 --> 00:20:07,178
He says the Klingons

391
00:20:07,287 --> 00:20:09,154
have been shooting them
out of the sky left and right.

392
00:20:09,191 --> 00:20:11,560
Unless something changes,
he figures the Klingons

393
00:20:11,596 --> 00:20:13,965
will take the settlement
the day after tomorrow.

394
00:20:16,073 --> 00:20:17,906
Did you see
all the <i>bat'leth</i> wounds today?

395
00:20:17,944 --> 00:20:19,880
Klingons get mad

396
00:20:19,914 --> 00:20:22,511
they forget about their
disruptors, go hand to hand.

397
00:20:22,553 --> 00:20:24,352
If you ask me,
they're looking to get even

398
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:25,826
for what happened on Ganalda IV.

399
00:20:25,861 --> 00:20:26,954
What happened?

400
00:20:26,997 --> 00:20:28,364
They had to retreat.

401
00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:29,925
Klingons hate that.

402
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:34,877
At least we don't have to worry
about them in here.

403
00:20:34,914 --> 00:20:36,577
Oh, don't be so sure.

404
00:20:36,618 --> 00:20:37,745
Medical personnel are fair game

405
00:20:37,787 --> 00:20:39,780
as far as Klingons
are concerned.

406
00:20:39,825 --> 00:20:41,658
They'll even kill wounded
right in their beds.

407
00:20:41,695 --> 00:20:44,166
Think they're giving
them an honorable death.

408
00:20:46,206 --> 00:20:48,973
So, how'd you wind up here?

409
00:20:50,247 --> 00:20:55,589
I, uh... I'm writing
an article about Dr. Bashir.

410
00:20:55,626 --> 00:20:57,493
You're a journalist?

411
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,591
No, not exactly.

412
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:01,696
What does that mean?

413
00:21:01,739 --> 00:21:05,942
I write stories, mostly...
you know, fiction.

414
00:21:07,452 --> 00:21:09,115
<i>I wonder if Kirby knew</i>

415
00:21:09,156 --> 00:21:10,853
<i>that the whole time</i>
<i>we were talking</i>

416
00:21:10,893 --> 00:21:14,424
<i>all I could think about was</i>
<i>how close the Klingons were.</i>

417
00:21:14,468 --> 00:21:16,666
<i>He didn't seem that worried.</i>

418
00:21:16,706 --> 00:21:19,041
<i>No one else seems</i>
<i>to be losing sleep over it</i>

419
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:22,245
<i>so why is it the only thing</i>
<i>I can think about?</i>

420
00:21:22,285 --> 00:21:24,278
<i>I've been on the station</i>
<i>when it was under attack</i>

421
00:21:24,389 --> 00:21:27,054
<i>plenty of times,</i>
<i>but somehow the danger</i>

422
00:21:27,096 --> 00:21:29,192
<i>never seemed as real</i>
<i>as it does here.</i>

423
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:31,534
<i>Maybe it's</i>
<i>because I spent all day</i>

424
00:21:31,572 --> 00:21:34,305
<i>seeing first-hand what</i>
<i>the Klingons are capable of</i>

425
00:21:34,411 --> 00:21:37,315
<i>or maybe it's because,</i>
<i>for the first time in my life</i>

426
00:21:37,385 --> 00:21:40,050
<i>my father's not here</i>
<i>to protect me.</i>

427
00:21:41,293 --> 00:21:42,318
What was that?

428
00:21:42,396 --> 00:21:43,329
The Klingons.

429
00:21:43,398 --> 00:21:44,833
They must have taken out
the reactor.

430
00:21:48,542 --> 00:21:49,841
Come on, come on!

431
00:21:51,215 --> 00:21:52,514
She's fibrillating.

432
00:21:52,551 --> 00:21:54,886
If we don't get power back soon,
we'll lose half the ward.

433
00:21:54,923 --> 00:21:56,722
Kidney failure,
he's going into renal shock.

434
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,252
I just talked to Resource.

435
00:21:58,297 --> 00:21:59,823
It's going to be
at least three hours

436
00:21:59,867 --> 00:22:00,857
before we have power.

437
00:22:02,841 --> 00:22:04,971
There must be some portable
generators we could use.

438
00:22:05,012 --> 00:22:07,506
They're using them
to keep the shields up

439
00:22:07,551 --> 00:22:08,644
around the settlement.

440
00:22:08,687 --> 00:22:09,951
The runabout.

441
00:22:09,989 --> 00:22:11,618
There's a portable
generator on the runabout.

442
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,993
Where is it?

443
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,123
About a kilometer south of here.

444
00:22:14,165 --> 00:22:15,326
I'll need help carrying it
though.

445
00:22:15,435 --> 00:22:17,337
Well, you won't be able
to beam through the shields.

446
00:22:17,406 --> 00:22:18,670
You'll have to take
the east tunnel.

447
00:22:18,709 --> 00:22:20,440
That lets out
beyond the perimeter.

448
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,709
I'll show you.

449
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:47,843
We set down
just over that ridge.

450
00:22:47,878 --> 00:22:50,008
Yeah. It looks familiar.

451
00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:51,382
Get down!

452
00:22:53,423 --> 00:22:54,516
Stay close.

453
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,892
And keep your head low.

454
00:23:03,078 --> 00:23:05,879
Whatever happens, one of us
has to get that generator.

455
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:06,943
Stick with me.

456
00:23:15,673 --> 00:23:17,472
Come on, Jake!

457
00:23:26,997 --> 00:23:28,022
Jake!

458
00:24:38,287 --> 00:24:40,520
Medkit...

459
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,826
over there.

460
00:24:42,864 --> 00:24:44,595
Now!

461
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,167
Hypo.

462
00:24:49,211 --> 00:24:51,010
Sit me up.

463
00:24:54,523 --> 00:24:55,856
Do it!

464
00:24:55,893 --> 00:24:59,230
I'm not going to die
with my face in the dirt.

465
00:25:02,974 --> 00:25:04,944
Okay...

466
00:25:10,892 --> 00:25:12,657
How's your head?

467
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:16,132
Hurts.

468
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:17,867
You're lucky I didn't kill you.

469
00:25:17,907 --> 00:25:19,740
I thought you were a Klingon.

470
00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:21,180
Have you seen any?

471
00:25:21,215 --> 00:25:22,514
What?

472
00:25:22,551 --> 00:25:23,850
Klingons!

473
00:25:23,887 --> 00:25:26,518
Are there any patrols around?

474
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,553
What about Starfleet?

475
00:25:28,598 --> 00:25:30,568
No.

476
00:25:30,603 --> 00:25:32,197
It's just you and me then.

477
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,833
What are you doing

478
00:25:33,876 --> 00:25:34,844
out here anyway?

479
00:25:34,879 --> 00:25:36,006
Why'd you leave the settlement?

480
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:41,351
I, uh... I was outside
when the shelling started.

481
00:25:41,392 --> 00:25:44,888
I... I guess I got lost
looking for cover.

482
00:25:44,934 --> 00:25:47,269
Lucky me.

483
00:25:47,306 --> 00:25:49,071
I could use the company.

484
00:25:50,445 --> 00:25:53,612
Here... water.

485
00:25:53,653 --> 00:25:55,749
What about you?

486
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:57,852
Go ahead.

487
00:26:01,938 --> 00:26:02,963
Thanks.

488
00:26:03,006 --> 00:26:06,241
Probably would have
leaked out of me anyway.

489
00:26:08,385 --> 00:26:10,412
Don't let me fall over.

490
00:26:10,489 --> 00:26:13,519
I want to go out
looking up at the sky

491
00:26:13,563 --> 00:26:15,533
not at the ground.

492
00:26:15,567 --> 00:26:16,900
Don't worry.

493
00:26:19,076 --> 00:26:20,978
You didn't see a crashed
hopper around here

494
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:21,981
did you?

495
00:26:22,015 --> 00:26:23,882
No.

496
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:26,450
They made it.

497
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,860
Who?

498
00:26:28,896 --> 00:26:30,263
My platoon.

499
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,167
The Klingon's
had us pinned down.

500
00:26:32,204 --> 00:26:33,468
We couldn't beam out

501
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,239
'cause they had
a transport scrambler running.

502
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:37,474
We called for a hopper.

503
00:26:37,549 --> 00:26:38,778
As soon as it set down

504
00:26:38,818 --> 00:26:40,481
the Klingons came after us.

505
00:26:40,522 --> 00:26:42,789
CO ordered me and Brice
to lay down cover

506
00:26:42,827 --> 00:26:44,923
so the squad
could get up the ramp.

507
00:26:44,966 --> 00:26:47,199
By the time Brice got in

508
00:26:47,237 --> 00:26:48,866
the Klingons were
practically on top of us.

509
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:50,171
Hopper was taking
such a pounding

510
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,907
I didn't think
it'd make it off the ground.

511
00:26:53,885 --> 00:26:56,618
You stayed behind on purpose
so they could get away.

512
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:59,095
The hypo... where is it?

513
00:27:00,132 --> 00:27:01,533
It's empty.

514
00:27:01,569 --> 00:27:03,904
Figures.

515
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:06,570
I'll get you out of here.

516
00:27:06,613 --> 00:27:08,048
I'll make a stretcher.

517
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:09,484
With what?

518
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:11,011
Then I'll carry you.

519
00:27:11,056 --> 00:27:12,855
Kid, you try carrying
me, my guts

520
00:27:12,893 --> 00:27:15,091
are going to spill
all over your shoes.

521
00:27:15,132 --> 00:27:17,330
But I have to do something.

522
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,066
I've got to try.

523
00:27:19,108 --> 00:27:20,337
Forget it.

524
00:27:20,376 --> 00:27:21,503
But I have to.

525
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,915
That way,
this will all make sense.

526
00:27:23,951 --> 00:27:25,750
Maybe I ran for a reason...

527
00:27:25,789 --> 00:27:28,420
so I could find you and...
and save your life.

528
00:27:28,461 --> 00:27:30,898
Ran?

529
00:27:30,933 --> 00:27:32,300
From the explosions.

530
00:27:32,336 --> 00:27:35,673
We had to get to the runabout,
for the generator.

531
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:39,411
And... the shelling started,
and I couldn't see Dr. Bashir

532
00:27:39,452 --> 00:27:42,482
and the explosions,
they kept getting closer.

533
00:27:42,526 --> 00:27:44,052
I had to get out of there.

534
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:45,395
So I ran.

535
00:27:45,431 --> 00:27:47,800
I ran and I kept running
until I found you.

536
00:27:47,837 --> 00:27:50,206
The doctor... you left him.

537
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:53,572
It was a mistake.

538
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:55,176
That's what you call it.

539
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,851
I didn't mean for it to happen.

540
00:27:57,892 --> 00:27:59,919
And now you think
bringing me back

541
00:27:59,964 --> 00:28:02,265
is going to make
everything all right.

542
00:28:05,175 --> 00:28:07,476
Sorry, kid...

543
00:28:07,514 --> 00:28:11,512
life doesn't work like that.

544
00:28:42,056 --> 00:28:43,787
Benjamin.

545
00:28:43,826 --> 00:28:45,659
I'll be right out.

546
00:28:49,506 --> 00:28:52,604
What have you been doing
in there for three hours?

547
00:28:52,646 --> 00:28:54,810
I was tweaking
the pattern buffers

548
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:56,581
in the replicator systems.

549
00:28:56,621 --> 00:28:57,988
Great.

550
00:28:58,024 --> 00:29:00,963
I always thought the coffee
could be a little hotter.

551
00:29:00,998 --> 00:29:02,934
I'm just trying to keep busy.

552
00:29:02,968 --> 00:29:04,369
Is it helping?

553
00:29:04,405 --> 00:29:06,933
No, not really.

554
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:10,242
I wish there was
something I could do.

555
00:29:10,285 --> 00:29:11,754
Some way I could promise you

556
00:29:11,788 --> 00:29:13,724
that everything is
going to be okay.

557
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:16,287
But you can't.
No one can.

558
00:29:18,168 --> 00:29:21,266
I know what it's like
to worry about a child.

559
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:26,584
Raifi put Tobin through hell.

560
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:29,524
When Neema was six

561
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,795
she came down
with Rugalan fever.

562
00:29:32,834 --> 00:29:36,399
Audrid spent two weeks
in the hospital with her

563
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:39,904
and never left her side.

564
00:29:39,949 --> 00:29:42,922
It was hundreds of years ago

565
00:29:42,956 --> 00:29:48,298
and I can still remember how...

566
00:29:48,334 --> 00:29:50,669
helpless I felt.

567
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:56,709
I read her all 17 volumes
of Caster's <i>Down the River Light</i>

568
00:29:56,754 --> 00:30:00,559
even though I knew
she couldn't hear me.

569
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:06,171
It made me feel
like I was doing something...

570
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:08,235
that we were still connected.

571
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:13,251
It wasn't...

572
00:30:13,289 --> 00:30:15,624
until much...

573
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:19,631
much after that

574
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:24,477
that I realized that I
was doing it as much for me

575
00:30:24,515 --> 00:30:27,043
as I was doing it for her.

576
00:30:27,087 --> 00:30:29,388
Just to keep busy.

577
00:30:33,535 --> 00:30:36,531
So, how did it turn out
with Neema?

578
00:30:36,574 --> 00:30:38,178
She pulled through.

579
00:30:38,311 --> 00:30:41,341
Whew. I was hoping you
were going to say that.

580
00:30:41,385 --> 00:30:44,118
Because if this story
had an unhappy ending

581
00:30:44,157 --> 00:30:46,127
I would have never forgiven you.

582
00:30:48,701 --> 00:30:51,195
Of course,
by the time she was 21

583
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,800
she wouldn't even speak to me.

584
00:30:52,844 --> 00:30:54,473
For how long?

585
00:30:54,514 --> 00:30:56,211
About eight years.

586
00:30:56,318 --> 00:30:57,810
Do me a favor.

587
00:30:57,855 --> 00:31:00,224
Tell me about it
some other time.

588
00:31:00,327 --> 00:31:03,926
Right now, all I care about
is seeing Jake.

589
00:31:03,968 --> 00:31:07,430
You will, tomorrow,
when we get to Ajilon Prime.

590
00:31:10,182 --> 00:31:14,590
You know, Ben,
coffee can never be too hot.

591
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:16,288
Are you sure you got

592
00:31:16,329 --> 00:31:18,664
the replicator buffers
synchronized?

593
00:31:19,969 --> 00:31:21,802
You want to check it
for yourself?

594
00:31:21,841 --> 00:31:22,809
I think I will.

595
00:31:22,843 --> 00:31:24,107
Can I borrow your decoupler?

596
00:31:25,415 --> 00:31:26,941
Get your own.

597
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:29,548
I have to check
the sonic shower relays.

598
00:31:29,591 --> 00:31:31,824
Good idea.

599
00:31:49,167 --> 00:31:51,570
How are you feeling?

600
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,040
Jake!

601
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:57,712
Jake, we thought you were...

602
00:31:57,753 --> 00:31:59,086
I'm okay.

603
00:31:59,122 --> 00:32:01,149
This is great.

604
00:32:01,194 --> 00:32:02,925
What happened?

605
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:07,703
I got knocked out when we were
trying to get to the runabout.

606
00:32:07,742 --> 00:32:10,715
Did Dr. Bashir
make it back all right?

607
00:32:10,748 --> 00:32:12,240
He's in IC for the night.

608
00:32:12,285 --> 00:32:14,084
He's got plasma burns
on his arm and shoulder.

609
00:32:14,122 --> 00:32:15,489
I don't know how he managed

610
00:32:15,525 --> 00:32:17,996
but he carried the generator
back here by himself.

611
00:32:18,031 --> 00:32:19,124
We went looking for you

612
00:32:19,166 --> 00:32:20,259
right after
the shelling stopped.

613
00:32:20,369 --> 00:32:21,268
I mean, there was

614
00:32:21,371 --> 00:32:22,840
hardly anything left
of the runabout.

615
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:26,508
The whole place was nothing
but bomb craters and-and smoke.

616
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:28,280
We had pretty much
given up hope.

617
00:32:28,386 --> 00:32:31,791
I must have wandered off in the
wrong direction when I came to.

618
00:32:31,827 --> 00:32:34,230
You are lucky you didn't
get picked up by the Klingons.

619
00:32:34,266 --> 00:32:37,239
Word is, they're massing
to attack the compound.

620
00:32:38,877 --> 00:32:40,106
You want to see him?

621
00:32:41,182 --> 00:32:42,981
No, I should let him rest.

622
00:32:43,019 --> 00:32:45,149
He's awake.
I was just in there.

623
00:32:46,793 --> 00:32:48,057
Go ahead.

624
00:32:48,097 --> 00:32:50,364
He'll be glad
to see you're okay.

625
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:06,132
Jake?!

626
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:08,003
Oh!

627
00:33:09,243 --> 00:33:10,974
Thank God!

628
00:33:11,013 --> 00:33:13,576
I thought you'd been killed.

629
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:17,458
Once the shelling had stopped,
and I couldn't find you

630
00:33:17,494 --> 00:33:19,988
I assumed the worst.

631
00:33:20,033 --> 00:33:22,060
I am so sorry.

632
00:33:22,105 --> 00:33:23,631
It's all right.

633
00:33:23,675 --> 00:33:24,974
No...

634
00:33:25,011 --> 00:33:26,640
no, it isn't.

635
00:33:26,681 --> 00:33:30,018
I should never have brought
you here in the first place.

636
00:33:30,055 --> 00:33:33,358
Now we're stuck here, the
Klingons massing to attack...

637
00:33:33,396 --> 00:33:34,865
What was I thinking?!

638
00:33:34,899 --> 00:33:36,732
Forget it, okay!

639
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:38,797
What's done is... is done.

640
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:44,274
<i>I couldn't stand hearing him</i>
<i>apologize to me like that</i>

641
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,553
<i>not after what I'd done to him.</i>

642
00:33:47,594 --> 00:33:49,063
All right, you two.

643
00:33:49,097 --> 00:33:50,396
Visiting hours are over.

644
00:33:50,434 --> 00:33:52,427
Let me have
a look at that.

645
00:33:57,849 --> 00:34:00,412
<i>I keep turning it over</i>
<i>in my head...</i>

646
00:34:00,523 --> 00:34:05,466
<i>the shelling, losing sight</i>
<i>of Bashir, running...</i>

647
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,903
<i>and I keep trying</i>
<i>to make sense of it all</i>

648
00:34:07,939 --> 00:34:10,103
<i>to justify what I did.</i>

649
00:34:10,143 --> 00:34:14,916
<i>But when it comes down to it,</i>
<i>there's only one explanation.</i>

650
00:34:14,954 --> 00:34:17,152
<i>I'm a coward.</i>

651
00:34:17,193 --> 00:34:20,132
<i>Part of me wishes Bashir</i>
<i>had seen me run away</i>

652
00:34:20,165 --> 00:34:22,101
<i>and told everyone the truth.</i>

653
00:34:22,137 --> 00:34:24,164
<i>They deserve</i>
<i>to know what I am.</i>

654
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:26,406
<i>They should know</i>
<i>they can't count on me.</i>

655
00:34:26,446 --> 00:34:29,510
<i>That, if the Klingons attack,</i>
<i>I'll run and hide</i>

656
00:34:29,552 --> 00:34:31,215
<i>just like I did before.</i>

657
00:34:37,403 --> 00:34:39,430
Dr. Kalandra asked me
to give this to you.

658
00:34:39,508 --> 00:34:40,875
Oh, thanks, Jake.

659
00:34:40,911 --> 00:34:42,608
Would you take this
to the patient in G-4?

660
00:34:42,648 --> 00:34:43,616
Sure.

661
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,415
Thanks.

662
00:34:49,664 --> 00:34:50,654
Here you go.

663
00:34:57,347 --> 00:35:00,217
Maybe I'll get
a job as a cutter.

664
00:35:00,253 --> 00:35:02,246
Could be interesting work.

665
00:35:02,292 --> 00:35:04,923
What's a cutter?

666
00:35:04,964 --> 00:35:07,231
You know, on a mining team.

667
00:35:07,269 --> 00:35:09,934
They're the ones who split
asteroids up with phasers

668
00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:13,278
so the excavators
can get at what's inside.

669
00:35:13,316 --> 00:35:16,847
You got to have good aim,
and no matter what else

670
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:17,983
you can say about me

671
00:35:18,026 --> 00:35:20,429
you can't say that I
don't have good aim.

672
00:35:20,465 --> 00:35:23,369
Because if I hadn't
hit my foot just right

673
00:35:23,404 --> 00:35:26,001
I would have taken
my whole leg off.

674
00:35:28,182 --> 00:35:30,983
It's funny.

675
00:35:31,021 --> 00:35:33,219
One minute,
your life's moving along

676
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,629
just like you always
thought it would

677
00:35:35,665 --> 00:35:41,702
and the next, you do something
that changes everything

678
00:35:41,745 --> 00:35:42,940
and that makes you realize

679
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,383
you're not
who you thought you were.

680
00:35:45,419 --> 00:35:47,321
At the Academy,
I did really well

681
00:35:47,357 --> 00:35:49,156
in the battle simulations.

682
00:35:49,194 --> 00:35:51,392
I never had any problems.

683
00:35:51,433 --> 00:35:52,526
But when you're out there

684
00:35:52,635 --> 00:35:56,440
and the live shells are
detonating all around you

685
00:35:56,477 --> 00:35:58,106
it's a whole different thing.

686
00:35:58,148 --> 00:35:59,640
All you can think about

687
00:35:59,685 --> 00:36:01,986
is getting away
from the explosions.

688
00:36:03,025 --> 00:36:05,326
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

689
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:07,732
You know something?

690
00:36:07,768 --> 00:36:09,032
You're the first person I've met

691
00:36:09,072 --> 00:36:10,871
since I've been here
that hasn't made me feel

692
00:36:10,909 --> 00:36:13,540
like I'm taking up
valuable bed space.

693
00:36:15,385 --> 00:36:17,879
The way everyone looks at me...

694
00:36:19,694 --> 00:36:21,596
I can't stand it.

695
00:36:23,503 --> 00:36:27,342
After the court-martial's over,
I'm definitely signing up

696
00:36:27,379 --> 00:36:30,546
for the next mining expedition
to the Gamma Quadrant.

697
00:36:30,652 --> 00:36:33,123
Maybe there won't be
a court-martial.

698
00:36:33,158 --> 00:36:34,525
You're right.

699
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,396
None of us may get
out of here alive.

700
00:36:37,434 --> 00:36:40,338
No, I mean Starfleet
could decide

701
00:36:40,373 --> 00:36:41,967
to send you
to counseling instead.

702
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:43,274
I won't go.

703
00:36:43,313 --> 00:36:46,775
I don't deserve
to be in Starfleet.

704
00:36:46,821 --> 00:36:50,317
Therapy won't change
what I did.

705
00:36:52,567 --> 00:36:54,560
Nothing will.

706
00:36:56,409 --> 00:37:00,578
I just wish I had aimed
that phaser a little higher.

707
00:37:14,615 --> 00:37:17,416
I saw the report
on Dr. Kalandra's desk.

708
00:37:17,455 --> 00:37:19,983
According to Resource,
it's just a matter of time

709
00:37:20,027 --> 00:37:21,963
before the Klingons
reach the compound.

710
00:37:21,998 --> 00:37:24,526
I guess that means
I have to decide.

711
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,039
Decide what?

712
00:37:26,074 --> 00:37:27,441
Whether I'd rather
get hacked to bits

713
00:37:27,477 --> 00:37:28,502
or blasted by a disrupter.

714
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:30,607
A disrupter, no doubt about it.

715
00:37:30,684 --> 00:37:34,089
Every molecule in your body...
vaporized in a flash.

716
00:37:34,125 --> 00:37:35,458
No time to feel pain.

717
00:37:35,494 --> 00:37:37,624
Don't be so sure about that.

718
00:37:37,733 --> 00:37:40,569
Some people think
it's like being boiled alive.

719
00:37:40,605 --> 00:37:41,800
Decapitation has its virtues.

720
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,903
Nice clean blow
with a sharp <i>bat'leth.</i>

721
00:37:43,946 --> 00:37:47,078
The brain lives on
for five, ten seconds at least.

722
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:52,793
In theory, your headless corpse
could be the last thing you see.

723
00:37:52,832 --> 00:37:54,802
You're so negative.

724
00:37:54,837 --> 00:37:56,272
I'm just telling you
what I heard.

725
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:57,867
What do you think, Jake?

726
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:58,935
I think it's not funny.

727
00:37:58,979 --> 00:37:59,947
Well, of course not.

728
00:37:59,982 --> 00:38:01,474
There's nothing funny
about having

729
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:02,487
your throat slit...

730
00:38:02,521 --> 00:38:03,489
Cut it out!

731
00:38:03,523 --> 00:38:05,186
I was just kidding.

732
00:38:05,227 --> 00:38:07,197
You think this is some joke.

733
00:38:07,231 --> 00:38:08,928
It's not.
People are dying.

734
00:38:08,968 --> 00:38:10,562
And it's all so stupid.

735
00:38:10,605 --> 00:38:13,578
This whole stupid war
is such a waste.

736
00:38:13,612 --> 00:38:15,309
In ten years, nobody's
going to remember

737
00:38:15,349 --> 00:38:16,374
what anybody did here.

738
00:38:16,417 --> 00:38:17,476
Jake...

739
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,219
Maybe you saved
a hopper full of people.

740
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,663
Maybe you shot yourself
in the foot.

741
00:38:22,698 --> 00:38:24,292
No one's going to remember!

742
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:25,702
Jake!

743
00:38:27,943 --> 00:38:29,708
Let's take a walk.

744
00:38:41,908 --> 00:38:42,967
I'm sorry.

745
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:48,044
Look, I know you're scared,
we all are.

746
00:38:48,088 --> 00:38:51,927
No... it's not that.

747
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,835
What, Jake?
What is it?

748
00:38:57,208 --> 00:39:00,272
I just didn't think
what they were saying was funny.

749
00:39:00,315 --> 00:39:03,880
Come on, that's not
what set you off.

750
00:39:03,922 --> 00:39:06,018
Something's eating at you.

751
00:39:06,061 --> 00:39:07,496
I can see it.

752
00:39:07,531 --> 00:39:09,296
I don't know
what you're talking about.

753
00:39:09,335 --> 00:39:10,861
Ever since you came back here

754
00:39:10,905 --> 00:39:13,308
you've been walking around
looking miserable.

755
00:39:14,646 --> 00:39:16,343
Leave me alone.

756
00:39:16,383 --> 00:39:17,442
Jake...

757
00:39:17,486 --> 00:39:19,285
Leave me alone.

758
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:22,387
All right,
if that's what you want.

759
00:39:22,431 --> 00:39:26,098
But if you want to talk,
you know where to find me.

760
00:40:16,315 --> 00:40:17,442
What's going on?

761
00:40:17,485 --> 00:40:19,079
Are they inside the compound?

762
00:40:19,121 --> 00:40:20,089
Everybody, listen!

763
00:40:20,124 --> 00:40:21,092
What's going on?

764
00:40:21,126 --> 00:40:22,094
Listen!

765
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:23,096
We're evacuating.

766
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,497
We're taking the patients

767
00:40:24,533 --> 00:40:26,970
out through the north tunnel
to the surface.

768
00:40:27,005 --> 00:40:29,135
A hopper will take us
down the peninsula

769
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:30,703
to the base at Tanandra Bay.

770
00:40:30,746 --> 00:40:32,375
That tunnel is almost
two kilometers long.

771
00:40:32,417 --> 00:40:33,716
We have over 70 patients
to move.

772
00:40:33,753 --> 00:40:35,416
Do you know how long
that's going to take?

773
00:40:35,457 --> 00:40:37,518
Resource is sending
a security detail

774
00:40:37,562 --> 00:40:39,498
to defend the hospital
and give us

775
00:40:39,533 --> 00:40:40,501
time to evacuate.

776
00:40:40,535 --> 00:40:41,628
We can do this.

777
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:43,868
We have to keep calm,
focus on our jobs.

778
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:45,469
Those people out there need us.

779
00:40:45,512 --> 00:40:46,480
Yes. Let's move.

780
00:40:46,514 --> 00:40:47,482
Come on.

781
00:40:47,516 --> 00:40:48,506
Go.

782
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,401
Give me a hand!

783
00:40:59,443 --> 00:41:00,707
Keep moving!

784
00:41:00,746 --> 00:41:02,340
Two guards?!
Is that it?!

785
00:41:02,383 --> 00:41:04,616
The others are out
defending the perimeter.

786
00:41:04,655 --> 00:41:06,488
Great. One's leaving.

787
00:41:06,525 --> 00:41:08,621
We're going
someplace safe, all right.

788
00:41:08,664 --> 00:41:09,632
Come on.

789
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:31,912
They're coming! Let's go!

790
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:32,916
Move! Move!

791
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:33,918
Come on, let's go!

792
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:35,251
Anyone left back there?!

793
00:41:35,289 --> 00:41:36,257
No.

794
00:41:36,291 --> 00:41:37,624
Go! Go!

795
00:41:41,202 --> 00:41:42,397
Get down!

796
00:42:23,194 --> 00:42:26,497
Jake... look who's here.

797
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,439
Dad...

798
00:42:30,477 --> 00:42:31,570
Don't move.

799
00:42:31,612 --> 00:42:33,776
Let Dr. Bashir check
you for injuries.

800
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:35,947
What happened?

801
00:42:35,989 --> 00:42:37,356
I came back for you

802
00:42:37,458 --> 00:42:39,519
when I realized you
weren't on the hopper.

803
00:42:39,563 --> 00:42:41,761
The cease-fire has
been reinstated.

804
00:42:41,801 --> 00:42:43,361
The Klingons are pulling out.

805
00:42:43,404 --> 00:42:44,633
It's over.

806
00:42:44,674 --> 00:42:46,268
The timing could have been
a little bit better

807
00:42:46,311 --> 00:42:49,078
but... uh, he seems
to be all right.

808
00:42:49,117 --> 00:42:53,058
Sealing the entranceway
was a risky thing to do.

809
00:42:53,093 --> 00:42:56,089
You nearly brought the whole
ceiling down on yourself.

810
00:42:56,133 --> 00:42:58,229
We never would have got
those patients out alive

811
00:42:58,271 --> 00:42:59,398
if you hadn't done it.

812
00:42:59,507 --> 00:43:01,170
You're a hero.

813
00:43:02,881 --> 00:43:04,350
More than anything

814
00:43:04,418 --> 00:43:07,721
I wanted to believe
what he was saying

815
00:43:07,759 --> 00:43:08,727
but the truth is

816
00:43:08,761 --> 00:43:10,754
I was just as scared
in the hospital

817
00:43:10,798 --> 00:43:12,495
as I'd been when we went
for the generator

818
00:43:12,535 --> 00:43:16,306
so scared
that all I could think about

819
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:19,077
was doing whatever it took
to stay alive.

820
00:43:19,116 --> 00:43:21,280
Once that meant running away

821
00:43:21,322 --> 00:43:23,885
and once it meant
picking up a phaser.

822
00:43:23,927 --> 00:43:25,988
The battle of Ajilon Prime

823
00:43:26,031 --> 00:43:28,970
will probably be remembered
as a pointless skirmish

824
00:43:29,005 --> 00:43:31,806
but I'll always remember it
as something more...

825
00:43:31,844 --> 00:43:33,073
as the place I learned

826
00:43:33,114 --> 00:43:35,551
that the line
between courage and cowardice

827
00:43:35,586 --> 00:43:38,319
is a lot thinner
than most people believe.

828
00:43:41,799 --> 00:43:45,068
I wasn't sure whether
to show it to you or not.

829
00:43:45,107 --> 00:43:47,237
Hmm.

830
00:43:47,278 --> 00:43:52,347
Anyone who's been in battle
would recognize himself in this

831
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:54,987
but most of us wouldn't
care to admit it.

832
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,771
It takes courage
to look inside yourself

833
00:43:59,806 --> 00:44:01,298
and even more courage

834
00:44:01,343 --> 00:44:03,940
to write it
for other people to see.

835
00:44:05,952 --> 00:44:08,185
I'm proud of you, son.
