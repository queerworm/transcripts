1
00:00:01,168 --> 00:00:03,378
<i>Last time on</i>
Deep Space Nine...

2
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:06,465
Bashir to Infirmary.
Medical emergency
on the Promenade.

3
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:10,344
I find it odd that
a conduit running
behind Garak's shop

4
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,596
should just happen
to overload.

5
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:18,101
Why would the Romulans want
to destroy the Flaxian's ship?

6
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:22,397
One possibility
is that the Romulans hired
the Flaxian to kill Garak

7
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:25,359
and then killed the Flaxian
when he failed
in his mission.

8
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,529
Do you know why
the Romulans might hire
someone to kill you?

9
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:29,822
I have
no idea.

10
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:32,825
MALE:
<i>You are investigating</i>

11
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:34,869
a very insignificant piece

12
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:36,704
of a much larger puzzle.

13
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:38,163
What do you mean?

14
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,957
There's been a great deal

15
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:42,376
of unusual Romulan activity
these past weeks.

16
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,753
You dragged me
into this investigation,

17
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,547
and you are now going
to cooperate with me!

18
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:49,299
"Dragged you in"?
I don't know what
you're talking...

19
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:52,135
You blew up
your own shop, Garak!

20
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,556
ODO:
<i>It's a Romulan warbird.</i>

21
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,182
In Cardassian space?

22
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,935
You're going to
attack the Dominion,
aren't you?

23
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:02,312
You're going to stage
a first strike against them

24
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,648
before they can come
into the Alpha Quadrant.

25
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:10,362
I'm asking you to serve
Cardassia again, by my side.

26
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:13,323
Garak, this is the man
who put you into exile.

27
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,367
This is the man
who just two days ago

28
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,244
tried to have you killed.

29
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,830
Yes, he is...

30
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:23,876
but it doesn't matter.

31
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,672
I am back.

32
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:31,050
<i>And now, the conclusion.</i>

33
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,092
BASHIR: I mean,
if you ask me
modern theater

34
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:35,387
has been on
the decline since
the late 23rd century.

35
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,222
I mean, just look
at the plays to have
come out of Earth

36
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,266
in the last 50 years,
and compare them

37
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:42,061
to the works of Willemheld
or Barton or Chow-yun.

38
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:45,439
Yes, yes!
Modern playwrights
have become obsessed

39
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,609
with writing human
interpretations of
alien theatrical works

40
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:52,112
while ignoring completely
our own unique
cultural heritage.

41
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,363
In the hopes of...

42
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,365
Chief?

43
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,993
Are you
listening to me?
What?

44
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:00,287
I thought so.

45
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,789
Oh.

46
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:04,332
Oh, I-I heard
every word you said.

47
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:05,626
And what do you think?

48
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,878
About what?

49
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,046
Any of it.

50
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:12,758
I...

51
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,509
don't know.

52
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,431
Look, what do you
want me to say?

53
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:22,726
Say you agree,
or say you disagree.

54
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:26,521
Say you hate theater.
Just say something.

55
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:30,484
Look, Julian, you said
you wanted to have lunch.

56
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,402
Well, we're having lunch.

57
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:35,280
Yes! But I was hoping
for a little more conversation

58
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,198
with my<i> plomeek</i> soup.

59
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:40,035
Ah, my mother taught me

60
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:42,454
if you try to combine
talking and eating,

61
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:45,373
you'll end up doing neither
very well.

62
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,420
Well, I suppose Garak taught me
to think of lunch

63
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,132
as a sort of arena
for philosophical debate.

64
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,095
I take it there's still no word
about Garak and Odo?

65
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:01,765
The Starship<i> Portland</i>
and a Cardassian cruiser

66
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:05,102
are still searching the Algira
sector for the runabout.

67
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:07,437
Well, that's not
entirely bad news.

68
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,397
If the runabout
had been destroyed,

69
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:12,026
they would have
found debris by now
or something to...

70
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:13,485
Kira to O'Brien.

71
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:14,778
Go ahead, Major.

72
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,655
Report to Ops, Chief.

73
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,866
There's something here we'd
like you to take a look at.

74
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,534
On my way.

75
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:28,125
SISKO: About ten minutes ago
our sensors picked up
high concentrations

76
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,794
of tetryon particles
moving toward the station.

77
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:33,380
I've never seen
readings like these.
What do you think?

78
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,674
Subspace energy
fluctuations?

79
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,843
Quantum fractures
in the electrodynamic
field?

80
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:40,428
EM spikes across
the spectrum?
You've got me.

81
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,056
Whatever it is,
it's getting closer.

82
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:44,683
And larger.
The tetryon concentrations

83
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:47,728
have increased ten percent
in the last 30 seconds.

84
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:51,481
There's an energy surge,
bearing 210 mark 315.

85
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:55,485
A ship is de-cloaking.
It's a Romulan warbird.

86
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,321
Romulans?
Open a channel...

87
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,448
Another warbird
is de-cloaking at 010...

88
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:03,368
No, it's a Cardassian ship.

89
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,579
A Cardassian ship
with a cloaking device?

90
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,790
Definitely Cardassian,
Keldon-class.

91
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,086
Benjamin, there's an entire
fleet de-cloaking out there.

92
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:15,005
Red Alert! All hands
to battle stations.

93
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:18,133
Shields up!
Stand by weapons.

94
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,313
Try to hail them,
Lieutenant.
Their weapons are charged,

95
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,024
but they haven't
locked on to us yet.

96
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:36,151
Lead ship's headed for
the wormhole, Commander.

97
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:43,075
No response to our hails.
The fleet's following
the lead ship.

98
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:45,202
They're headed for
the Gamma Quadrant.

99
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:49,206
Lieutenant, open
a priority channel
to Starfleet Command now.

100
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,787
You should have seen the look
on Legate Porania's face

101
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:56,457
when I told him I was going
into retirement three years ago.

102
00:06:56,457 --> 00:07:00,045
He was literally speechless--
a rare event.

103
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:03,257
I remember wanting to invent
charges of treason
against him

104
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:05,759
just so I wouldn't have
to hear his voice again.

105
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,054
And you would have, too,
if I hadn't held you back.

106
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,765
You had quite a vicious
streak in those days.

107
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,433
Oh, I learned...
from the best.

108
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,643
No, no,
you had a gift.

109
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:18,605
I never met anyone else
who relished a good
interrogation

110
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,565
as much as you did.

111
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,860
Do you remember getting
that confession
out of Dr. Parmak?

112
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,820
I never even touched him.

113
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,614
That was
the beauty of it.

114
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,950
You just sat there
for, what?
Three hours?

115
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,244
Four!
And after four hours

116
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:36,456
of watching you
stare at him,
he confessed.

117
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,834
(<i> chuckles</i> ):
I<i> was</i> good, wasn't I?

118
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,502
You were brilliant.

119
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:44,047
Afterwards,
he just kept saying,

120
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:47,508
"His eyes...
his eyes."

121
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,140
I've missed you, Elim.

122
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,476
Things just haven't been
the same since you left.

123
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,438
I've missed you,
too, Enabran.

124
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,529
We're both getting
sentimental
in our old age.

125
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,948
Hmm.
Next thing you know,

126
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:12,200
we'll be crying
over our lost youth.

127
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:16,455
So, whatever happened
to Dr. Parmak?

128
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:18,873
He spent three years
in a labor camp,

129
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,460
then returned
to Cardassia Prime.

130
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,754
I think he's practicing
medicine again.

131
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:28,549
When we get back,
you should look him up.

132
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:32,262
Oh, there are a number
of people I intend to
look up when we get back.

133
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,763
For instance,

134
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,766
do you remember
a Gul named Dukat?

135
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,435
Dukat?

136
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:41,355
Oh, yes, the business
with the arms merchants.

137
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:44,358
Mm-hmm.
I take it you'd like
to have him eliminated.

138
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,609
The thought had
crossed my mind.

139
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,695
When this mission
is completed,

140
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:52,032
you'll be in a position to
eliminate anyone you want.

141
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:55,285
I'll make up a list
and give it to Mila.

142
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,122
Perhaps you'd better
give it to me personally.

143
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:02,376
Mila may not be
around much longer.

144
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:07,547
She knows a great deal about me,
too much for her own good.

145
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:13,094
Well, still, it would be
a shame to have her killed.

146
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,431
She's proven that she can be
trusted on numerous occasions,

147
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:20,310
and you'd be hard put
to find a better housekeeper.

148
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,063
Is this a request I hear?

149
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,690
Not at all.
Just an observation.

150
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,569
No reason to pretend, Garak.
You're fond of Mila.

151
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,322
You don't want
her hurt, right?

152
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,199
If you're looking
for an excuse

153
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,076
to spare the life
of your own housekeeper,

154
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:39,037
you don't need me
to provide you with one.

155
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:43,333
You can do it out
of the kindness of your heart.

156
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,919
Mila always believed

157
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,048
you were innocent
of betraying Cardassia...

158
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,134
and me.

159
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:55,929
I was.

160
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,680
Of course.

161
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:07,566
No wonder the Romulans
can't conquer the galaxy.

162
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:09,443
No one can stomach
their cuisine.

163
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:10,735
(<i> door opening</i> )

164
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,488
TAIN:
Ah, Colonel Lovok.

165
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:17,200
Allow me to introduce
my associate, Elim Garak.

166
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,494
And what is his role to be
in this operation?

167
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:22,330
He will do whatever
I require of him.

168
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,625
Elim is
a cherished colleague
of long standing.

169
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,627
He will not enter the Bridge

170
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,589
or any other secured space
aboard this ship unescorted.

171
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,632
If you do so,
you will be killed.

172
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,551
Direct, isn't he?

173
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,844
I'm afraid
the Colonel believes
in wasting little time

174
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:39,306
on pleasantries
or idle conversation.

175
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,308
The fleet is re-cloaked
and is about to set course

176
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,184
for the Founders' homeworld
at warp six.

177
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,478
GARAK:
Warp six?

178
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,521
That's a bit slow,
isn't it?

179
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:48,982
Something wrong
with your engines?

180
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:53,403
If we travel any faster,
our warp signatures may be
detected by the Jem'Hadar,

181
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:55,405
even through
the cloaking devices.

182
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,157
Very clever.

183
00:10:57,157 --> 00:11:00,368
The changeling is
in quarters on C deck.

184
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:03,121
There are force fields
in place to prevent his escape.

185
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:07,125
Good. Which brings us
to your first
assignment, Garak.

186
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,127
I want you to
explain to Odo

187
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,254
that it would be
in everyone's
best interest--

188
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:14,215
especially his-- if
he were to provide us

189
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,675
with all the information
he has on his people.

190
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:20,221
Now, that might
prove difficult.
He can be quite stubborn.

191
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:23,517
Then you'll have
to find a way
of convincing him.

192
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,274
(<i> door opening</i> )

193
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:34,819
Well, Odo, I trust
the accommodations

194
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,030
meet with your approval.
(<i> snorts</i> )

195
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,283
Well, you have to admit
it's certainly better
than a prison cell.

196
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,701
There are force fields
around the bulkheads

197
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,703
and a guard outside the door.

198
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:46,623
Feels like a prison cell to me.

199
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,583
I see your point.

200
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,127
And believe me, if it were
my decision, things would...

201
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,963
I<i> don't</i> believe you, Garak,
and I doubt I'll believe

202
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,840
much of what you have
to say from now on.

203
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,176
So save us both some trouble
and leave me alone.

204
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:02,472
Why, Constable, you seem
positively disappointed in me.

205
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:05,308
Well, I suppose
it's understandable.

206
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:09,354
After all, I did pledge
my undying devotion

207
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:12,232
and eternal allegiance
to both you and the Federation.

208
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:15,610
And you and I have been
through so much together--

209
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:21,533
shared many experiences--
and I know you considered me
a close friend.

210
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,784
No wonder you
feel betrayed.

211
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,120
You're wasting
your time, Garak.

212
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,289
I don't care about
the rationalizations

213
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,208
you come up with
to justify your actions.

214
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:35,672
To justify? I don't
need to justify
anything to you.

215
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:38,799
Living on Deep Space 9
has made you a little rusty.

216
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:42,136
Your lies are becoming
more transparent.
You should be careful.

217
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:45,557
You don't want Tain to know
that you're feeling guilty
about what you've done.

218
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:48,435
You<i> are</i>
imaginative, I'llgrant
you that, Constable,

219
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:53,565
but I would suggest that
you put those creative
powers to better use.

220
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,568
We would like you to share

221
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:59,778
your<i> unique</i> insights
on the Founders.

222
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:02,823
Would you?
We would be grateful--
most grateful--

223
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,825
for any information
you could provide.

224
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,327
And if I refuse?

225
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,996
Oh, really, Odo.

226
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,165
You really must stop reading

227
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,543
those human crime novels
Chief O'Brien gives you.

228
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:15,794
It's poisoning your thinking.

229
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:20,799
I'm not here to threaten you.
I just want to talk.

230
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,303
I don't feel like talking.

231
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:26,889
Surely, you can see that we
share a common enemy--

232
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,391
the Founders.

233
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,143
By cooperating,

234
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:33,187
you'll be helping
us provide security

235
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,523
for the entire
Alpha Quadrant.

236
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:39,235
The only common enemy
you and I share
is Enabran Tain.

237
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:44,073
The difference
between you and I
is that you don't know it.

238
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:49,036
I suggest that you think over
what I've said, Constable.

239
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:52,915
Funny, I was about to make
the same suggestion.

240
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:06,179
Since the Jem'Hadar

241
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,846
are genetically
addicted to a drug

242
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:09,848
that only the Founders
can provide,

243
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:12,477
we expect the Jem'Hadar
to weaken and die

244
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:15,062
once their supplies
of the drug run out.

245
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,524
A matter of days,
by our estimates.

246
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:20,193
However, that will give them
enough time to stage

247
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:23,571
some kind of counterattack
against the Alpha Quadrant.

248
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:27,116
So I suggest you place
the Cardassian fleet on alert.

249
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,076
I take this action
not in defiance

250
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:32,121
of the Cardassian state,
but in defense of it.

251
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,040
You in the Central Command

252
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,626
have neglected
the security of our people

253
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:39,086
and allowed peace with Bajor
and the Federation

254
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:43,007
to blind you to the real threat,
the Dominion.

255
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,677
I intend to remove that threat.

256
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:47,637
Let history be my judge.

257
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,015
That message was intercepted

258
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,933
by a Federation outpost
earlier today.

259
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,228
A similar message was sent
to the Romulan Senate.

260
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,313
Now both governments
are denying

261
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,315
any prior knowledge
of Tain's plans

262
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,401
and calling this
a rogue operation.

263
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,528
Are they going to do
anything to stop Tain?

264
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,405
Both the Romulans
and the Cardassians

265
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,741
claim to be studying ways
to stop Tain.

266
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,534
But we believe
that they'll just sit back

267
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,786
and wait to see
if he succeeds or not.

268
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,496
But, sir, that could
plunge Romulus

269
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,998
and Cardassia into war
with the Dominion.

270
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,917
Only if he fails, Lieutenant.

271
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:21,212
His plan looks like it's got
a fair chance of success.

272
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:23,005
He's commanding
a fleet of 20 ships

273
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,049
manned by combat veterans.

274
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,468
They know the location
of the Founders' homeworld

275
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,345
and they've modified
their cloaks

276
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:32,098
so the Jem'Hadar
can't detect their approach.

277
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,975
It sounds like you're hoping
Tain<i> will</i> succeed.

278
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,270
I never hope for war, Major.

279
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,732
But if it comes,
I'd rather see the Dominion

280
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,316
on the losing side.

281
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:45,236
However, we have to plan
for the worst.

282
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:50,241
Ben, I want you to evacuate DS9
of all non-essential personnel

283
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,535
and put the<i> Defiant</i>
on standby alert.

284
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:54,871
Even if Tain succeeds,

285
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:57,290
the Jem'Hadar are going to come
screaming out of the wormhole

286
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,250
looking for revenge,
and they may not be

287
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,419
too particular
who their targets are.

288
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:04,631
Admiral, we believe
Security Chief Odo

289
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,507
is aboard one
of the Romulan ships.

290
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,426
Odo's message said
the runabout

291
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,887
had been caught
in a tractor beam.

292
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,472
That suggests
he was captured

293
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,307
and taken aboard
one of their ships.

294
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,809
SISKO: I'd like permission
to take the<i> Defiant</i>

295
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,310
into the Gamma Quadrant

296
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,061
and try to determine
if he's still alive.

297
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,814
I'm sorry about your officer,

298
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,523
but there's nothing we can do.

299
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,859
I want the<i> Defiant</i>
guarding Bajor.

300
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:28,112
That's your top priority.

301
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,447
Toddman out.

302
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:40,374
Commander Eddington,
am I correct in assuming

303
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,126
Starfleet is
planning to send

304
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,295
substantial reinforcements
to this sector?

305
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:47,214
Yes, sir.
A task force of nine starships

306
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,008
is due to arrive tomorrow.

307
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,802
Nine starships.

308
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,305
I want the<i> Defiant</i>
prepared to leave

309
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:56,349
for the Gamma Quadrant
in two hours.

310
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:59,226
Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders
were quite clear on...

311
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:02,229
I am not going to just
abandon one of my officers.

312
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:05,191
Toddman's concerned
about the defense of Bajor,

313
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,693
and so am I.

314
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,611
If we detect
a Jem'Hadar strike force

315
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,363
heading for the Alpha Quadrant,

316
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,782
we'll use the communications
relay to warn DS9.

317
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:16,410
And we'll do everything we can
to stop them before
they reach the wormhole.

318
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:20,206
I consider this
a volunteer mission,

319
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:23,001
but don't volunteer yet.

320
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:27,380
There's a good chance
you won't be coming back
from this mission.

321
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,132
And even if you do,

322
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:33,720
you'll probably be facing
a general court-martial.

323
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,891
If you do decide to go,

324
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:41,185
be aboard the<i> Defiant</i>
at 1530 hours.

325
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,103
Dismissed.

326
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,957
All stations report.

327
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,458
KIRA: Tactical ready.

328
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,168
O'BRIEN:
Warp and impulse
engines on line.

329
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,962
Cloaking device standing by.
DAX: Helm ready.

330
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:10,006
Security detachment
is aboard

331
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,008
and phaser rifles have been
issued to every fire team.

332
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,384
SISKO:
Release docking clamps.

333
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:14,969
Commander,
there's an incoming

334
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,804
priority message
from Starfleet Command.

335
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,305
It's Admiral Toddman.

336
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,433
He's repeating
his order

337
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,309
not to enter
the Gamma Quadrant.

338
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:25,312
That's what you
<i>think</i> it says.

339
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,273
How can you be sure

340
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:30,359
when a transmission is as
badly garbled as that one?

341
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,196
You're right.

342
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,449
There's an awful lot
of subspace interference

343
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:37,992
on this channel.

344
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:40,286
Must be an ion storm
or something.

345
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,537
Must be.

346
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:45,416
Aft thrusters,
back one-quarter.

347
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,501
Port and starboard
at station keeping.

348
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,668
The cloaking device
is operating within
normal parameters.

349
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,795
Set course for
the Founders' homeworld.

350
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:33,255
Warp eight.

351
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,466
LOVOK:
We know that the Founders'
planet lies

352
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:39,178
at approximately
these coordinates
within the Omarion Nebula.

353
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:43,141
As you can see, there are
no Jem'Hadar bases nearby.

354
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:44,892
This means that
even if the Founders

355
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,936
did send out
a distress call

356
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:49,522
it would take
at least seven hours
for any help to arrive.

357
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:53,233
Our plan is to wait
until we've entered orbit
of the Founders' planet,

358
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,569
then de-cloak and begin
massive bombardment.

359
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,155
LOVOK:
Computer analysis
indicates

360
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:58,823
that the planet's crust
will be destroyed

361
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:01,117
within one hour,
and the mantle within five.

362
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:03,494
Well, that should more than
take care of the Founders.

363
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:07,665
Yes, it should.
Unless they have some
planetary defenses

364
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,458
we don't know about.

365
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,169
There is one person here

366
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:14,714
who might answer
that question-- Mr. Odo.

367
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,133
Anything he knows
about the Founders
and their planet

368
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:20,053
was undoubtedly included
in his report to Starfleet.

369
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:24,682
The Constable is
remarkably thorough
in these matters.

370
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:29,020
There was a time when
you were eager to begin
an interrogation, Elim.

371
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:34,192
In fact, I remember having
to restrain your enthusiasm
on several occasions.

372
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:38,154
Well, then you should
also remember the pride
I took in my work.

373
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:42,867
I don't think that
interrogating someone who
can alter their form at will

374
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:46,662
is likely to provide either
amusement or information.

375
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:50,457
I wouldn't worry about Mr. Odo's
shape-shifting, if I were you.

376
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:53,335
The Obsidian Order
has developed a device

377
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:56,547
which should prove quite
effective in neutralizing him.

378
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:58,549
I was not informed
about this device.

379
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,426
It's only a prototype.

380
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,762
We've never had
a chance to test it...

381
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,764
until now.

382
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:07,266
Perhaps the Tal Shiar
should take over

383
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,185
the interrogation
of the changeling.

384
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:11,478
No.
It's all right, Garak.

385
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,355
It's my fault.

386
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,608
I should have known
you'd develop feelings

387
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:18,861
for these people
you've been living with
for the past few years.

388
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:22,489
But I just never expected
that you would become friends

389
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:25,118
with someone who worked
for the Bajorans.

390
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:28,996
This has nothing to do with
my friends or my feelings.

391
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:32,959
I simply don't believe he has
the information you want.

392
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:35,795
Possibly.
Colonel Lovok will find out.

393
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,379
No.

394
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,924
I brought Odo here.

395
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:44,011
He's my prisoner
and my responsibility.

396
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,512
You don't have to do this.

397
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:46,764
Yes, I do.

398
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:48,348
And I think we both know

399
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:52,103
that you won't trust me
until I do.

400
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:54,730
All right.

401
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,067
I look forward
to hearing your results.

402
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:04,865
(<i> console beeping</i> )
Commander,

403
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,993
I'm reading some kind
of power fluctuation

404
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:08,535
in the cloaking device.

405
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:11,205
What kind of fluctuation?
I don't know.

406
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:13,291
I can't locate the source
of the problem,

407
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:14,750
but it<i> is</i>
getting worse.

408
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,836
KIRA:
We're de-cloaking.

409
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,172
All stop. Full scan,
Lieutenant.

410
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:21,465
Are there any other
ships in the area?

411
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,217
No, nothing in
sensor range.

412
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:24,927
Commander,
if the Jem'Hadar show up

413
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,428
while we're de-cloaked...

414
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,514
We'll have to fight
our way out of here.

415
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,648
Everything looks fine.

416
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:39,441
The power converters
are on line.

417
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:42,528
The projection matrix
looks normal.

418
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,404
The cloaking device
should be working.

419
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:46,657
Maybe there's some kind
of spatial anomaly nearby

420
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:48,909
that's interfering
with the cloak's
power systems.

421
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:52,330
This isn't the result
of a spatial anomaly, Major.

422
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:55,958
The tetryon compositor
on the cloaking device
has been sabotaged.

423
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,126
How do you know that?

424
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,087
Because I sabotaged it.

425
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:03,132
Why?
I was under orders
from Admiral Toddman

426
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:05,383
to stop you from pursuing
the Romulan/Cardassian fleet.

427
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:07,385
O'BRIEN:
You've turned us
into sitting ducks

428
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:08,846
for the Jem'Hadar!

429
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:10,514
But we can still
defend ourselves.

430
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,766
I didn't damage any
of the ship's weapon systems

431
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,727
or the engines.

432
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:18,898
But, without the cloak,
we'll have to return to DS9.

433
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:22,235
I'm sorry, Commander.
I didn't want to do this.

434
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:26,322
Odo's my friend, too,
but I report directly
to Admiral Toddman

435
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:29,116
and he gave me
an explicit order.
I couldn't disobey it.

436
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,077
I don't suppose
you could.

437
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,619
Chief...

438
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,412
now that we know
that the problem

439
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:36,165
is in the tetryon
compositor,

440
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,209
how long until
you can fix it?

441
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:39,710
About ten hours.
You've got two.

442
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,961
On your way.

443
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,679
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to confine you

444
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,139
to quarters,
<i>Mr.</i> Eddington.

445
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,767
Sir, if we run
into the Jem'Hadar,

446
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:57,103
you're still going to need
a Chief Security Officer.

447
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,146
What makes you think
we'll trust you again?

448
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:02,275
Because I give you my word.

449
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:05,403
I make it a policy to
never question the word

450
00:24:05,403 --> 00:24:09,073
of anyone who wears
that uniform.

451
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:12,576
Don't make me
change that policy.

452
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,536
Man your station, Commander.

453
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:21,627
But... I'd stay out
of the Chief's way
if I were you.

454
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:31,469
I realize it must be
nearly time for you

455
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,347
to return
to your liquid state,

456
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:37,017
so I thought I'd bring you
something to relax in.

457
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,437
How kind.
But before you
go for a swim,

458
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:41,897
I have a few questions
I'd like to ask you.

459
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,565
I have nothing to say.

460
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,525
Well, I had hoped
a few hours alone

461
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,569
might jog your memory,
but I can see

462
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:52,074
I'm going to have to take
some steps I'd hoped to avoid.

463
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:56,494
Oh, no, you're going to
torture me, aren't you?

464
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:58,914
How I've been
dreading this.

465
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,499
Please, have mercy, Garak.

466
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:05,379
You do have a certain
flair for sarcasm.

467
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:08,548
It's one of the things
I like about you.

468
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,720
You can go now.

469
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:18,142
I'd bring those guards
back, if I were you.

470
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:20,186
I'm not in a
very good mood.

471
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,146
Yes, under normal
circumstances,

472
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:25,107
you would pose quite
a threat to me.

473
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:30,029
You could turn yourself into,
uh, a Vicarian razorback

474
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:35,117
or stretch out your arms
and strangle me from
across the room.

475
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:37,161
But not this time.

476
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:40,080
Oh, and why is that?

477
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,541
Because this device is emitting
a quantum stasis field

478
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:45,919
designed to prevent
any changeling

479
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,672
from altering
his biomolecular structure.

480
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:58,765
(<i> grunts</i> )

481
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,144
(<i> grunts</i> )
Yes.

482
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:05,481
It must be
very disconcerting for you

483
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:09,151
to be locked into a humanoid
form, especially now.

484
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:11,278
I'm sure you were
looking forward

485
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:14,740
to returning
to your liquid state.

486
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,535
Tell me...

487
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:21,080
what will happen if you
<i>can't</i> revert to a liquid?

488
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,667
I don't know.
An honest answer.

489
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:30,548
But it's probably safe to say
that it won't be pleasant.

490
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:35,928
Garak, this is pointless.

491
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:39,432
There's nothing I can tell you
about the Founders
that you don't already know.

492
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:41,183
I wish I could believe that.

493
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:42,600
Then why don't you?

494
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,479
Because you and I are so alike.

495
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:49,191
We both value our privacy,
our secrets.

496
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:52,861
That's why I know there's
something about the Founders
you haven't told anyone.

497
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,239
Something you didn't even share

498
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:59,243
with Starfleet
and Commander Sisko, hmm?

499
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:04,790
But you are going
to tell me, Odo.

500
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,833
There's nothing to tell!

501
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:11,297
Well, perhaps something
will come to you.

502
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:13,215
I can wait.

503
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:15,384
The question is...

504
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,596
can you?

505
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:30,648
Major...

506
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:32,443
leave the Chief alone.

507
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:35,279
What makes you think
I'm going to see O'Brien?

508
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,325
All right, it's
been three hours.

509
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:41,368
I just wanted to see
if he needed some help.

510
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,911
If he needed help,
he would ask for it.

511
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,247
For now, the best thing
we can do

512
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:46,915
is to stay out of his way.

513
00:27:58,511 --> 00:28:00,012
(<i> sighs</i> )

514
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,807
(<i> shuddering</i> )

515
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,858
What's the matter, Garak?

516
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:15,027
You don't look very happy.

517
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:17,029
Aren't you enjoying yourself?

518
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:20,949
There is no pleasure
in this for me, Constable.

519
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:24,203
I assure you.
I am simply doing my job.

520
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:25,871
Your job?

521
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,414
Yes!

522
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:31,126
This job you've been
waiting for...

523
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:34,838
all... all these years of exile.

524
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:40,553
And here you are,
interrogating a prisoner again.

525
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:45,224
It must fill you with pride.

526
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:49,353
Odo, just tell me what I need
to know, and this will end.

527
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:52,398
(<i> screaming</i> )

528
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:57,861
But... but... but you don't
want it to end, do you, Garak?

529
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:01,865
Isn't this what you've
been dreaming of?

530
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,909
Back at work...

531
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:06,453
serving Cardassia.

532
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:07,913
That's right.

533
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:10,249
And you have information
that I need,

534
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:14,127
information that it's my duty
to extract from you.

535
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,546
It's not personal.

536
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:17,631
(<i> screaming</i> )

537
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,303
Odo, talk to me!

538
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,389
Tell me something!

539
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:27,558
Anything.

540
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:32,563
Lie if you have to,
but say it now, please.

541
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:39,194
Home! I want to go home!

542
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,738
And you will, I promise.

543
00:29:40,738 --> 00:29:42,573
As soon as
this is all over,

544
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:45,200
I promise I'll take you back
to Deep Space 9.

545
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,287
No! Not the station.

546
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,581
Home with my people.

547
00:29:50,581 --> 00:29:52,207
The Founders?
Yes.

548
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,293
You want to return
to the Founders?
Yes.

549
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:56,169
I thought you turned
your back on them.

550
00:29:56,169 --> 00:30:00,048
I did, but they're
still my people.

551
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,050
I tried to deny it.

552
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,677
I tried to forget.

553
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:05,512
But I can't.

554
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,264
They're my people,

555
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:12,728
and I want to be with
them in the Great Link.

556
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:17,023
I knew there was
something secret
you were holding back.

557
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:20,360
And now you've found it.

558
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,238
I hope it's useful.

559
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:54,311
Repairs are
complete, sir.

560
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:56,104
The cloaking device
is on line.

561
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:59,566
A souvenir
of your handiwork.

562
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,487
Engage cloak.

563
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:06,031
DAX:
The cloak is
operating normally.

564
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,907
Resume course
to the Founders' planet.

565
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:09,660
Maximum warp.

566
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,662
Did you get anything
out of him at all?

567
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:14,373
Nothing.
He never broke.

568
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:16,082
Well, that's unfortunate.

569
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:19,127
I see no further use
for Mr. Odo.
Terminate him.

570
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:23,131
On the other hand, he is a
member of the Bajoran Militia

571
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,425
and an officer
on Deep Space 9.

572
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:28,928
We may not wish to provoke
the Federation by killing him.

573
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,889
I agree with Garak.
Do you?

574
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,266
Yes. There's no
way to be certain

575
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,727
that all of the
Founders will be

576
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:36,478
on the planet
when we attack.

577
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:38,063
We should be prepared
to encounter

578
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:40,065
other changelings
in the future.

579
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:43,068
And we could use
more information
on their capabilities.

580
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:46,112
I want to take Odo back to
Romulus for further study.

581
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:49,241
All right, in the interest
of cooperation.

582
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:50,826
ROMULAN:
Bridge to Colonel Lovok.

583
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:52,285
This is Lovok.

584
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,537
We have entered
the Omarion Nebula

585
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:55,288
and dropped out of warp.

586
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:57,165
We should be in orbit of
the planet in 15 minutes.

587
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,876
Acknowledged.

588
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:02,588
Well, it seems the moment
is nearly at hand.

589
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:03,963
Gentlemen.

590
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,014
Can I do something
for you, Colonel?

591
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:15,016
Why were you trying to
protect the changeling?

592
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,894
I wasn't trying
to protect him.

593
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:19,145
And as I recall, you thought
it was a good idea

594
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:20,814
to keep him alive as well.

595
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:23,191
My interest in
the changeling
is based on

596
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:26,236
what I believe to be
the strategic interests
of the Romulan Empire.

597
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:29,948
But you... you seem to have
a personal interest in him.

598
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,659
Well, tell me,
what else am I feeling?

599
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:36,329
I've never been
psychoanalyzed
by a Romulan before.

600
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,874
This is a fascinating
experience.

601
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:41,251
You are a practiced
liar, Mr. Garak,

602
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:43,211
but I am a
practiced observer.

603
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,464
And I can assure you,
I am going to be

604
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:48,007
observing you
very closely.

605
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,727
HELM:
We are within disruptor range.

606
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:00,479
Scan the planet for life-signs.

607
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:02,355
Sensors show multiple
life-forms on the surface.

608
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,107
They appear to be
in a liquid state.

609
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,442
The Founders.

610
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:07,068
Signal the fleet
to charge weapons

611
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:09,112
and lock on to
their targets.

612
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:11,573
We will open fire
the moment we drop
our cloaks.

613
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:14,701
All ships report ready,
all weapons charged.

614
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:18,163
So much for the Dominion.

615
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:19,915
Open fire.

616
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,379
HELM:
The first barrage
is complete.

617
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,840
Effect?

618
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,591
30 percent
of the planetary crust

619
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:31,677
destroyed on opening volley.

620
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:33,553
No change in life-form readings.

621
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:36,348
What?
That's impossible.

622
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,016
Some of them had
to be killed.

623
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,726
Our sensor readings
have been confirmed

624
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:41,520
by three other warbirds.
There's no change

625
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,188
in the number of life-signs
on the surface.

626
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:45,231
They're using
an automated transponder

627
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:47,526
to send back
false sensor readings.

628
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,194
The planet's deserted!

629
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,112
Colonel, signal the fleet...

630
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,698
Colonel, there are
ships coming out
of the nebula.

631
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:54,867
What type of ships?
Jem'Hadar fighters.

632
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:55,951
How many?

633
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,829
I asked you a question!

634
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:01,206
One hundred fifty.

635
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,045
Tactical display on screen.

636
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:10,423
GARAK:
It's a trap.

637
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:14,177
They've been waiting
for us all along.

638
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:35,156
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

639
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,534
The Cardassian Cruiser
<i>Koranak</i> has been destroyed.

640
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:40,286
Romulan Warbirds<i> Makar</i>
and<i> Belak</i> have lost
main power.

641
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,706
Bring us about
to 318 mark 215.

642
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:45,375
Concentrate fire
on ships attacking
on the port quarter.

643
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:47,044
(<i> yells</i> )

644
00:34:47,044 --> 00:34:49,922
The Jem'Hadar will destroy
every ship if we stay!

645
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:52,591
Our only hope is to return
to the Alpha Quadrant!

646
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:54,217
There's no way
out of here, Garak.

647
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,094
The Jem'Hadar have cut us off.

648
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,805
We need to consolidate the fleet
and make our stand here.

649
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,807
How could this be?
What could have happened?

650
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:04,227
I'm afraid the fault, dear Tain,
is not in our stars

651
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,271
but in ourselves.
What?!

652
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:09,274
Something I learned
from Dr. Bashir.

653
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:12,069
Main power's out.
Switching to emergency backups.

654
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:14,529
Bridge to Engineering.
We need power to the weapons.

655
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:17,991
Bridge to Engineering,
respond!

656
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:19,492
I'll be in Engineering.

657
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,327
Tain, take command
of the Bridge.

658
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:24,664
Four more Jem'Hadar vessels
closing on our position.

659
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,438
(<i> grunts</i> )

660
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,778
I take it the attack
on the Founders

661
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:56,780
is not proceeding
according to plan.

662
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,574
No, it's not, but I suggest
we make our way to the runabout.

663
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:02,494
For once, Garak,
I agree with you.

664
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,749
You'll need this in order to
gain access to your runabout.

665
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,044
Why are you doing this?

666
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:14,339
Because no changeling
has ever harmed another.

667
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,675
You are one
of the Founders?

668
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:19,594
Of course.
This whole plan

669
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,680
was the Founders' idea
in the first place.

670
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,058
You<i> wanted</i>
the Tal Shiar
and the Obsidian Order

671
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:27,602
to combine forces
and come into
the Gamma Quadrant

672
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,270
so you could
wipe them out.

673
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:32,149
Not exactly--
Tain originated the plan,

674
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:36,361
and when we learned of it,
we did everything we could
to carry it forward.

675
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:38,155
The Tal Shiar
and the Obsidian Order

676
00:36:38,155 --> 00:36:40,448
are both ruthless,
efficient organizations.

677
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,117
A definite
threat to us.

678
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:43,994
But not after today.

679
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:46,329
After today,
the only real threat to us

680
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:49,624
from the Alpha Quadrant
are the Klingons
and the Federation.

681
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,626
And I doubt that
either of them

682
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,837
will be a threat
for much longer.

683
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:03,596
It is not too late
for you, Odo.

684
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,682
Come with me.

685
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:07,350
You can still become one

686
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,769
with the Great Link,
if you wish.

687
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,150
Thank you.

688
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:18,028
But my answer
is still no.

689
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:30,040
Come on! I don't think
we have much time.

690
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,751
The runabout is that way.
Two decks down, section 25.

691
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:34,293
Wait for me there.
Where are you going?

692
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:36,213
To the Bridge,
to get Tain.
What?

693
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:38,506
I know it's difficult for you
to understand, Constable,

694
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,341
but I still owe him
a personal debt

695
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:42,135
and I have to try
to repay it.

696
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:44,345
Wait for us
as long as you can.

697
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:51,394
GARAK:
Tain! We have to go!

698
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,689
There must have been
an informant.

699
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,649
That's the only
explanation.

700
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:59,360
Yes, there was an informant.
You're right.

701
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,030
Colonel Lovok
is a changeling.
Lovok?

702
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:04,282
Yes, but that's something
we can discuss at another time.

703
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,992
Right now, we have to...

704
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,827
It appears I have
underestimated the Founders.

705
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,454
I should have seen it coming.

706
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:11,539
There was a time
when nothing got past me.

707
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,208
You remember, don't you, Elim?

708
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:17,254
Yes, I do!
But now we have to go!

709
00:38:17,254 --> 00:38:20,423
Go where? Back to Mila
and my quiet retirement?

710
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,509
I don't think so.
I must be getting old.

711
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:26,930
I let my pride
override my instinct.

712
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:29,099
Wouldn't have played it
that way in the old days.

713
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:32,227
In the old days, I would have
kept Lovok at arm's length.

714
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:34,104
He was too cagey, too smart.

715
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:36,940
I can't just leave you here!

716
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,734
I always did have
a soft spot for you, Garak.

717
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,027
Another of my flaws.

718
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,488
Enabran!

719
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:44,739
(<i> grunts</i> )

720
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:47,450
These Founders, Elim,

721
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,368
they're very good.

722
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:53,248
Next time, we should
be more careful.

723
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:59,921
You can be very persuasive
on occasion, Constable.

724
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:03,175
But in the future,
I hope you'll consider
using gentler language.

725
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:06,803
I'll keep that in mind.
A Jem'Hadar ship
is following us.

726
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:09,430
Raise shields and
charge the weapons.

727
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,432
Aft shields
down to 50 percent.

728
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,434
More speed would
be advisable.

729
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,353
The warp drive
is off-line.

730
00:39:18,315 --> 00:39:20,317
Shields down
to 30 percent!

731
00:39:20,317 --> 00:39:22,819
Another Jem'Hadar ship is
approaching to starboard.

732
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:24,321
Hang on!

733
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:26,572
Shields down
to 15 percent.

734
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:31,077
Main power is failing.
We're losing speed.

735
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:35,874
The shields are gone.

736
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:41,171
Odo, I hope
that you will accept

737
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:44,174
my sincere apologies
for all this.

738
00:39:44,174 --> 00:39:46,009
A little late, isn't it?

739
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:47,677
Nevertheless.

740
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:54,017
I may not agree
with what you did,

741
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:58,479
but I can certainly understand
your desire to return home.

742
00:39:58,479 --> 00:39:59,772
Thank you.

743
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,149
(<i> console beeping</i> )

744
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,317
What?

745
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,869
Three more coming in
off the port bow.

746
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:15,621
Fire on the lead ship, then
bring us back to the runabout.

747
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:20,377
Two life-signs on
the runabout, Commander.

748
00:40:20,377 --> 00:40:22,712
Drop shields.
Bridge to Transporter Room.

749
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:25,257
Beam them aboard, Chief.
O'BRIEN: Aye, sir.

750
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:28,134
Four more Jem'Hadar ships
closing to starboard.

751
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,594
O'Brien to Bridge.
I've got them.

752
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:30,929
Raise shields.

753
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,513
Welcome back.

754
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:33,723
Thank you.

755
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:35,392
Oh, that
looks painful.

756
00:40:35,392 --> 00:40:38,311
It is,
but it did save my life.

757
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:43,816
Shields at 80 percent.

758
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:46,319
Attack pattern Omega four.
Full impulse power.

759
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:49,197
Hold your fire until we're
within 500 meters.

760
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,283
We might get pretty singed
at that range.

761
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:55,287
Not as singed
as they're going to get.

762
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:56,329
Engage!

763
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:00,959
50,000 meters and closing.

764
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,714
2,000 meters.

765
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:10,051
Five hundred.
Fire!

766
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,608
The third Jem'Hadar ship
is still pursuing.

767
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,152
Aft torpedoes, fire!

768
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,072
KIRA:
Direct hit on
their port nacelle.

769
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:32,615
They're losing speed.

770
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,409
We're out
of their weapons range.

771
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:36,535
Any other signs of pursuit?
DAX: Negative.

772
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:38,746
The other fighters
are still concentrating

773
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,999
on the remaining Romulan
and Cardassian ships.

774
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:43,335
Let's not wait around for them
to change their minds.

775
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:46,004
Set course for the wormhole,
Lieutenant, warp eight.

776
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,551
It's good to see
you again, Constable.

777
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:53,970
Likewise, Major.

778
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,263
DAX:
Course laid in.

779
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,684
Engage.

780
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:05,773
There is still
no indication

781
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,608
that any Romulan or
Cardassian vessel

782
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,110
survived the attack.

783
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,821
Sounds like Wolf 359
all over again.

784
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:13,781
I had the same thought.

785
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:16,701
You may be interested to know
I've decided not to file charges

786
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:19,329
against anyone
aboard the<i> Defiant.</i>
Thank you, sir.

787
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:21,039
But if you pull a stunt
like that again,

788
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,875
I'll court-martial you,
or I'll promote you.

789
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,960
Either way, you'll be
in a lot of trouble.

790
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,546
I'll keep that in mind, sir.

791
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:47,440
(<i> sighs</i> )

792
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:05,208
ODO:
I just read the report
that you wrote

793
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:07,001
and I wanted
to thank you.

794
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:10,046
Me? For what?

795
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:16,553
For not mentioning
my desire to return
to my people.

796
00:43:16,553 --> 00:43:19,180
I consider
the entire conversation

797
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:22,892
as something...
best forgotten.

798
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:24,477
As do I.

799
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:29,315
Quark has expressed
an interest

800
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:32,402
in renting this space
if you're not going
to be using it.

801
00:43:32,402 --> 00:43:34,153
Oh?
He mentioned something

802
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:36,989
about an Argelian
massage facility.

803
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:40,034
Unfortunately, I don't think
Commander Sisko would approve

804
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:43,788
of such an interesting facility
on the Promenade.

805
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:45,831
I tend to agree.

806
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:50,420
But I do think he would
approve of a tailor's shop.

807
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:54,466
Do you know
what the sad part is, Odo?

808
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,803
I'm a very good tailor.

809
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:06,436
Garak...

810
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:09,439
I was thinking
that you and I

811
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:12,400
should have breakfast
together sometime.

812
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,235
Why, Constable--

813
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:17,280
I thought
you<i> didn't</i> eat.

814
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,948
I don't.
