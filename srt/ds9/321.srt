1
00:00:03,131 --> 00:00:04,259
Last time on <i>Deep Space Nine...</i>

2
00:00:04,301 --> 00:00:05,291
Bashir to Infirmary.

3
00:00:05,336 --> 00:00:07,773
Medical emergency
on the Promenade.

4
00:00:07,809 --> 00:00:09,108
I find it odd

5
00:00:09,146 --> 00:00:11,617
that a conduit running
behind Garak's shop

6
00:00:11,651 --> 00:00:13,747
should just happen to overload.

7
00:00:16,597 --> 00:00:19,263
Why would the Romulans want
to destroy the Flaxian's ship?

8
00:00:19,303 --> 00:00:20,431
One possibility

9
00:00:20,473 --> 00:00:23,503
is that the Romulans hired
the Flaxian to kill Garak

10
00:00:23,547 --> 00:00:26,748
and then killed the Flaxian
when he failed in his mission.

11
00:00:26,788 --> 00:00:29,625
Do you know why the Romulans
might hire someone to kill you?

12
00:00:29,661 --> 00:00:31,028
I have no idea.

13
00:00:32,301 --> 00:00:34,066
You are investigating

14
00:00:34,106 --> 00:00:38,173
a very insignificant piece
of a much larger puzzle.

15
00:00:38,283 --> 00:00:40,048
What do you mean?

16
00:00:40,086 --> 00:00:41,316
There's been a great deal

17
00:00:41,356 --> 00:00:43,623
of unusual Romulan activity
these past weeks.

18
00:00:43,662 --> 00:00:46,031
Now you dragged me
into this investigation

19
00:00:46,067 --> 00:00:47,696
and you are now going
to cooperate with me!

20
00:00:47,738 --> 00:00:49,037
"Dragged you in"?

21
00:00:49,075 --> 00:00:50,476
I don't know
what you're talking...

22
00:00:50,512 --> 00:00:53,383
You blew up your
own shop, Garak!

23
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:56,856
It's a Romulan warbird.

24
00:00:56,894 --> 00:00:58,557
In Cardassian space?

25
00:00:58,598 --> 00:01:01,332
You're going to attack
the Dominion, aren't you?

26
00:01:01,371 --> 00:01:03,774
You're going to stage
a first strike against them

27
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,008
before they can come
into the Alpha Quadrant.

28
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:11,619
I'm asking you to serve
Cardassia again, by my side.

29
00:01:11,662 --> 00:01:14,601
Garak, this is the man
who put you into exile.

30
00:01:14,636 --> 00:01:16,607
This is the man
who just two days ago

31
00:01:16,641 --> 00:01:18,544
tried to have you killed.

32
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:21,108
Yes, he is...

33
00:01:23,089 --> 00:01:25,618
but it doesn't matter.

34
00:01:27,935 --> 00:01:29,906
I am back.

35
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,241
And now, the conclusion.

36
00:01:32,312 --> 00:01:33,576
I mean, if you ask me

37
00:01:33,615 --> 00:01:35,244
modern theater has
been on the decline

38
00:01:35,352 --> 00:01:36,616
since the late 23rd century.

39
00:01:36,655 --> 00:01:39,184
I mean, just look at the plays
to have come out of Earth

40
00:01:39,228 --> 00:01:40,993
in the last 50 years,
and compare them

41
00:01:41,032 --> 00:01:43,561
to the works of Willemheld
or Barton or Chow-yun.

42
00:01:43,606 --> 00:01:44,768
Yes, yes!

43
00:01:44,809 --> 00:01:46,837
Modern playwrights
have become obsessed

44
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:48,679
with writing
human interpretations

45
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:51,452
of alien theatrical works,
while ignoring completely

46
00:01:51,491 --> 00:01:53,485
our own unique
cultural heritage.

47
00:01:53,529 --> 00:01:54,657
In the hopes of...

48
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:56,760
Chief?

49
00:01:56,803 --> 00:01:58,295
Are you listening to me?

50
00:01:58,374 --> 00:01:59,307
What?

51
00:01:59,377 --> 00:02:01,644
I thought so.

52
00:02:01,682 --> 00:02:02,810
Oh.

53
00:02:02,852 --> 00:02:05,723
Oh, I-I heard
every word you said.

54
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,023
And what do you think?

55
00:02:07,062 --> 00:02:09,260
About what?

56
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,394
Any of it?

57
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:14,072
I...

58
00:02:14,111 --> 00:02:15,842
don't know.

59
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,917
Look, what do you
want me to say?

60
00:02:20,961 --> 00:02:24,025
Say you agree,
or say you disagree.

61
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:26,302
Say you hate theater.

62
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:27,935
Just say something.

63
00:02:27,978 --> 00:02:31,817
Look, Julian, you said
you wanted to have lunch.

64
00:02:31,854 --> 00:02:33,882
Well, we're having lunch.

65
00:02:33,926 --> 00:02:37,196
Yes! But I was hoping
for a little more conversation

66
00:02:37,234 --> 00:02:38,567
with my <i>plomeek</i> soup.

67
00:02:38,604 --> 00:02:40,438
Ah, my mother taught me

68
00:02:40,475 --> 00:02:43,642
if you try to combine
talking and eating

69
00:02:43,683 --> 00:02:46,747
you'll end up doing neither
very well.

70
00:02:48,962 --> 00:02:52,198
Well, I suppose Garak taught me
to think of lunch

71
00:02:52,237 --> 00:02:54,835
as a sort of arena
for philosophical debate.

72
00:02:56,781 --> 00:02:59,618
I take it there's still no word
about Garak and Odo?

73
00:02:59,654 --> 00:03:03,117
The Starship <i>Portland</i>
and a Cardassian cruiser

74
00:03:03,163 --> 00:03:05,566
are still searching the Algira
sector for the runabout.

75
00:03:05,601 --> 00:03:08,301
Well, that's not
entirely bad news.

76
00:03:08,341 --> 00:03:10,312
If the runabout
had been destroyed

77
00:03:10,346 --> 00:03:12,340
they would have found
debris by now

78
00:03:12,418 --> 00:03:13,682
or something to...

79
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:15,247
Kira to O'Brien.

80
00:03:15,292 --> 00:03:16,454
Go ahead, Major.

81
00:03:16,495 --> 00:03:17,691
Report to Ops, Chief.

82
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,099
There's something here
we'd like you to take a look at.

83
00:03:20,137 --> 00:03:21,902
On my way.

84
00:03:26,485 --> 00:03:27,715
About ten minutes ago

85
00:03:27,754 --> 00:03:29,622
our sensors picked up
high concentrations

86
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:32,257
of tetryon particles
moving toward the station.

87
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:33,734
I've never seen
readings like these.

88
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:34,737
What do you think?

89
00:03:34,771 --> 00:03:37,004
Subspace energy fluctuations?

90
00:03:37,043 --> 00:03:39,378
Quantum fractures
in the electrodynamic field?

91
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,079
EM spikes across the spectrum?

92
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,145
You've got me.

93
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,819
Whatever it is,
it's getting closer.

94
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,988
And larger.

95
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,003
The tetryon concentrations
have increased ten percent

96
00:03:48,037 --> 00:03:49,336
in the last 30 seconds.

97
00:03:49,374 --> 00:03:52,245
There's an energy surge,
bearing 210 mark 315.

98
00:03:52,281 --> 00:03:54,411
A ship is de-cloaking.

99
00:03:54,452 --> 00:03:56,821
It's a Romulan warbird.

100
00:03:56,858 --> 00:03:59,854
Romulans?
Open a channel...

101
00:03:59,898 --> 00:04:02,803
Another warbird
is de-cloaking at 010...

102
00:04:02,838 --> 00:04:04,934
No, it's a Cardassian ship.

103
00:04:04,977 --> 00:04:07,950
A Cardassian ship
with a cloaking device?

104
00:04:07,985 --> 00:04:10,149
Definitely Cardassian,
Keldon-class.

105
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,631
Benjamin, there's an entire
fleet de-cloaking out there.

106
00:04:13,665 --> 00:04:14,724
Red Alert!

107
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:16,567
All hands to battle stations.

108
00:04:16,605 --> 00:04:17,904
Shields up!

109
00:04:17,942 --> 00:04:19,639
Stand by weapons.

110
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:32,870
Try to hail them, Lieutenant.

111
00:04:32,911 --> 00:04:34,005
Their weapons are charged

112
00:04:34,047 --> 00:04:35,641
but they haven't
locked on to us yet.

113
00:04:35,684 --> 00:04:37,678
Lead ship's headed
for the wormhole, Commander.

114
00:04:41,732 --> 00:04:42,928
No response to our hails.

115
00:04:42,969 --> 00:04:44,769
The fleet's following
the lead ship.

116
00:04:44,806 --> 00:04:46,503
They're headed
for the Gamma Quadrant.

117
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,741
Lieutenant,
open a priority channel

118
00:04:48,783 --> 00:04:50,845
to Starfleet Command now.

119
00:06:50,003 --> 00:06:53,307
You should have seen the look
on Legate Porania's face

120
00:06:53,345 --> 00:06:56,877
when I told him I was going
into retirement three years ago.

121
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,016
He was literally speechless...

122
00:06:59,059 --> 00:07:00,289
a rare event.

123
00:07:00,329 --> 00:07:03,826
I remember wanting to invent
charges of treason against him

124
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,399
just so I wouldn't have
to hear his voice again.

125
00:07:06,443 --> 00:07:09,177
And you would have, too,
if I hadn't held you back.

126
00:07:09,216 --> 00:07:11,745
You had quite a vicious
streak in those days.

127
00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:13,919
Oh, I learned...
from the best.

128
00:07:13,961 --> 00:07:16,398
No, no, you had a gift.

129
00:07:16,433 --> 00:07:17,766
I never met anyone else

130
00:07:17,803 --> 00:07:19,603
who relished
a good interrogation

131
00:07:19,641 --> 00:07:20,940
as much as you did.

132
00:07:20,978 --> 00:07:23,108
Do you remember getting
that confession

133
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,847
out of Dr. Parmak?

134
00:07:24,887 --> 00:07:26,413
I never even touched him.

135
00:07:26,457 --> 00:07:28,051
That was the beauty of it.

136
00:07:28,094 --> 00:07:29,928
You just sat there for, what?

137
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:30,934
Three hours?

138
00:07:30,968 --> 00:07:32,164
Four!

139
00:07:32,204 --> 00:07:35,474
And after four hours
of watching you stare at him

140
00:07:35,513 --> 00:07:37,039
he confessed.

141
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:40,455
I was good, wasn't I?

142
00:07:40,491 --> 00:07:42,085
You were brilliant.

143
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,657
Afterwards, he just kept saying

144
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:48,233
"His eyes... his eyes."

145
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,513
I've missed you, Elim.

146
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:57,122
Things just haven't been
the same since you left.

147
00:07:57,164 --> 00:08:00,103
I've missed you, too, Enabran.

148
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:09,053
We're both getting sentimental
in our old age.

149
00:08:09,093 --> 00:08:10,083
Hmm.

150
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:11,496
Next thing you know

151
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:14,026
we'll be crying
over our lost youth.

152
00:08:14,072 --> 00:08:17,170
So, whatever happened
to Dr. Parmak?

153
00:08:17,212 --> 00:08:19,547
He spent three years
in a labor camp

154
00:08:19,584 --> 00:08:22,318
then returned
to Cardassia Prime.

155
00:08:22,358 --> 00:08:25,525
I think he's practicing
medicine again.

156
00:08:25,566 --> 00:08:29,337
When we get back,
you should look him up.

157
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,004
Oh, there are a number of people

158
00:08:31,045 --> 00:08:32,982
I intend to look up
when we get back.

159
00:08:33,017 --> 00:08:34,281
For instance

160
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,692
do you remember
a Gul named Dukat?

161
00:08:37,728 --> 00:08:39,197
Dukat?

162
00:08:39,232 --> 00:08:41,499
Oh, yes, the business
with the arms merchants.

163
00:08:41,537 --> 00:08:42,767
Mm-hmm.

164
00:08:42,874 --> 00:08:45,038
I take it you'd like
to have him eliminated.

165
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:47,608
The thought had crossed my mind.

166
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,383
When this mission is completed

167
00:08:49,423 --> 00:08:52,521
you'll be in a position
to eliminate anyone you want.

168
00:08:52,564 --> 00:08:56,027
I'll make up a list
and give it to Mila.

169
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,943
Perhaps you'd better
give it to me personally.

170
00:08:59,982 --> 00:09:03,183
Mila may not be
around much longer.

171
00:09:03,222 --> 00:09:08,394
She knows a great deal about me,
too much for her own good.

172
00:09:08,435 --> 00:09:13,778
Well, still, it would be
a shame to have her killed.

173
00:09:13,881 --> 00:09:17,788
She's proven that she can be
trusted on numerous occasions

174
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:21,128
and you'd be hard put
to find a better housekeeper.

175
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,730
Is this a request I hear?

176
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:24,900
Not at all.

177
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:26,604
Just an observation.

178
00:09:26,645 --> 00:09:28,445
No reason to pretend, Garak.

179
00:09:28,483 --> 00:09:30,386
You're fond of Mila.

180
00:09:30,421 --> 00:09:32,824
You don't want her hurt, right?

181
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,830
If you're looking for an excuse

182
00:09:34,932 --> 00:09:37,666
to spare the life
of your own housekeeper

183
00:09:37,706 --> 00:09:40,474
you don't need me
to provide you with one.

184
00:09:40,512 --> 00:09:44,180
You can do it out
of the kindness of your heart.

185
00:09:44,221 --> 00:09:46,715
Mila always believed

186
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,827
you were innocent
of betraying Cardassia...

187
00:09:52,374 --> 00:09:53,968
and me.

188
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,744
I was.

189
00:09:56,784 --> 00:09:59,153
Of course.

190
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:07,908
No wonder the Romulans
can't conquer the galaxy.

191
00:10:07,978 --> 00:10:09,641
No one can stomach
their cuisine.

192
00:10:12,856 --> 00:10:14,450
Ah, Colonel Lovok.

193
00:10:14,493 --> 00:10:18,127
Allow me to introduce
my associate, Elim Garak.

194
00:10:18,169 --> 00:10:20,504
And what is his role to be
in this operation?

195
00:10:20,542 --> 00:10:23,174
He will do whatever
I require of him.

196
00:10:23,214 --> 00:10:26,552
Elim is a cherished colleague
of long standing.

197
00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:28,320
He will not enter the Bridge

198
00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:31,526
or any other secured space
aboard this ship, unescorted.

199
00:10:31,568 --> 00:10:33,596
If you do so,
you will be killed.

200
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:34,733
Direct, isn't he?

201
00:10:34,775 --> 00:10:37,976
I'm afraid the Colonel believes
in wasting little time

202
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,316
on pleasantries
or idle conversation.

203
00:10:40,355 --> 00:10:42,553
The fleet is re-cloaked
and is about to set course

204
00:10:42,594 --> 00:10:44,428
for the Founders' homeworld
at warp six.

205
00:10:44,465 --> 00:10:45,524
Warp six?

206
00:10:45,568 --> 00:10:46,764
That's a bit slow, isn't it?

207
00:10:46,804 --> 00:10:48,866
Something wrong
with your engines?

208
00:10:48,909 --> 00:10:50,469
If we travel any faster

209
00:10:50,513 --> 00:10:54,010
our warp signatures may be
detected by the Jem'Hadar

210
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:56,355
even through
the cloaking devices.

211
00:10:56,394 --> 00:10:58,228
Very clever.

212
00:10:58,265 --> 00:11:00,759
The changeling is
in quarters on C deck.

213
00:11:00,804 --> 00:11:04,267
There are force fields
in place to prevent his escape.

214
00:11:04,313 --> 00:11:07,651
Good. Which brings us
to your first assignment, Garak.

215
00:11:07,687 --> 00:11:09,418
I want you to explain to Odo

216
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:12,260
that it would be in
everyone's best interest...

217
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:14,793
especially his...
if he were to provide us

218
00:11:14,837 --> 00:11:17,776
with all the information
he has on his people.

219
00:11:17,812 --> 00:11:19,783
Now, that might prove difficult.

220
00:11:19,816 --> 00:11:21,547
He can be quite stubborn.

221
00:11:21,588 --> 00:11:25,894
Then you'll have to find a way
of convincing him.

222
00:11:32,447 --> 00:11:35,352
Well, Odo, I trust
the accommodations

223
00:11:35,387 --> 00:11:37,358
meet with your approval.

224
00:11:37,392 --> 00:11:38,884
Well, you have

225
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:41,423
to admit it's certainly better
than a prison cell.

226
00:11:41,469 --> 00:11:43,804
There are force fields
around the bulkheads

227
00:11:43,841 --> 00:11:45,401
and a guard outside the door.

228
00:11:45,444 --> 00:11:47,677
Feels like a prison cell to me.

229
00:11:47,716 --> 00:11:49,083
I see your point.

230
00:11:49,186 --> 00:11:52,888
And believe me, if it were
my decision, things would...

231
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:55,230
I don't believe you, Garak,
and I doubt I'll believe

232
00:11:55,268 --> 00:11:57,102
much of what you have to say
from now on.

233
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,304
So save us both some trouble
and leave me alone.

234
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:03,651
Why, Constable, you seem
positively disappointed in me.

235
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:07,596
Well, I suppose
it's understandable.

236
00:12:07,631 --> 00:12:10,365
After all, I did pledge
my undying devotion

237
00:12:10,404 --> 00:12:14,072
and eternal allegiance
to both you and the Federation.

238
00:12:14,113 --> 00:12:16,813
And you and I have been
through so much together...

239
00:12:16,853 --> 00:12:21,193
shared many experiences...
and I know you considered me

240
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,722
a close friend.

241
00:12:22,767 --> 00:12:24,430
No wonder you feel betrayed.

242
00:12:24,472 --> 00:12:26,409
You're wasting your time, Garak.

243
00:12:26,443 --> 00:12:28,812
I don't care
about the rationalizations

244
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:31,378
you come up with
to justify your actions.

245
00:12:31,422 --> 00:12:32,823
To justify?

246
00:12:32,859 --> 00:12:36,801
I don't need to justify
anything to you.

247
00:12:36,834 --> 00:12:39,966
Living on Deep Space 9
has made you a little rusty.

248
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,310
Your lies are becoming
more transparent.

249
00:12:42,348 --> 00:12:43,544
You should be careful.

250
00:12:43,584 --> 00:12:45,110
You don't want Tain to know

251
00:12:45,155 --> 00:12:47,319
that you're feeling guilty
about what you've done.

252
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,160
You are imaginative,
Constable

253
00:12:49,264 --> 00:12:51,667
I'll grant you that,
but I would suggest

254
00:12:51,703 --> 00:12:54,642
that you put those creative
powers to better use.

255
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,076
We would like you to share

256
00:12:58,119 --> 00:13:01,058
your unique insights
on the Founders.

257
00:13:01,092 --> 00:13:02,060
Would you?

258
00:13:02,094 --> 00:13:03,962
We would be grateful...
most grateful...

259
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:05,867
for any information
you could provide.

260
00:13:05,904 --> 00:13:08,102
And if I refuse?

261
00:13:08,143 --> 00:13:10,046
Oh, really, Odo.

262
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:12,143
You really must stop reading

263
00:13:12,253 --> 00:13:14,919
those human crime novels
Chief O'Brien gives you.

264
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,157
It's poisoning your thinking.

265
00:13:17,198 --> 00:13:18,895
I'm not here to threaten you.

266
00:13:18,935 --> 00:13:22,033
I just want to talk.

267
00:13:22,076 --> 00:13:25,380
I don't feel like talking.

268
00:13:25,417 --> 00:13:28,413
Surely, you can see that we
share a common enemy...

269
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:29,893
the Founders.

270
00:13:29,928 --> 00:13:31,295
By cooperating

271
00:13:31,331 --> 00:13:34,304
you'll be helping us
provide security

272
00:13:34,338 --> 00:13:36,741
for the entire Alpha Quadrant.

273
00:13:36,778 --> 00:13:39,615
The only common enemy
you and I share

274
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,882
is Enabran Tain.

275
00:13:40,922 --> 00:13:43,393
The difference between you and I

276
00:13:43,427 --> 00:13:45,398
is that you don't know it.

277
00:13:45,432 --> 00:13:50,240
I suggest that you think over
what I've said, Constable.

278
00:13:50,311 --> 00:13:54,116
Funny, I was about to make
the same suggestion.

279
00:14:05,948 --> 00:14:06,938
Since the Jem'Hadar

280
00:14:06,984 --> 00:14:08,749
are genetically addicted
to a drug

281
00:14:08,788 --> 00:14:09,984
that only the Founders

282
00:14:10,024 --> 00:14:13,020
can provide,
we expect the Jem'Hadar

283
00:14:13,065 --> 00:14:14,364
to weaken and die

284
00:14:14,401 --> 00:14:16,132
once their supplies
of the drug run out.

285
00:14:16,172 --> 00:14:18,473
A matter of days,
by our estimates.

286
00:14:18,511 --> 00:14:21,211
However, that will give them
enough time to stage

287
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:24,692
some kind of counterattack
against the Alpha Quadrant.

288
00:14:24,726 --> 00:14:25,684
So I suggest you place
the Cardassian fleet on alert.

289
00:14:25,684 --> 00:14:28,019
So I suggest you place
the Cardassian fleet on alert.

290
00:14:28,057 --> 00:14:30,221
I take this action
not in defiance

291
00:14:30,262 --> 00:14:33,759
of the Cardassian state,
but in defense of it.

292
00:14:33,804 --> 00:14:35,103
You in the Central Command

293
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:37,201
have neglected
the security of our people

294
00:14:37,245 --> 00:14:39,774
and allowed peace with Bajor
and the Federation

295
00:14:39,818 --> 00:14:43,691
to blind you to the real threat,
the Dominion.

296
00:14:43,727 --> 00:14:46,256
I intend to remove that threat.

297
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,703
Let history be my judge.

298
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,811
That message was intercepted

299
00:14:51,847 --> 00:14:53,750
by a Federation outpost
earlier today.

300
00:14:53,785 --> 00:14:56,758
A similar message was sent
to the Romulan Senate.

301
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:58,352
Now both governments are denying

302
00:14:58,396 --> 00:15:00,367
any prior knowledge
of Tain's plans

303
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:02,395
and calling this
a rogue operation.

304
00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:05,344
Are they going to do
anything to stop Tain?

305
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:06,848
Both the Romulans
and the Cardassians

306
00:15:06,883 --> 00:15:09,481
claim to be studying ways
to stop Tain.

307
00:15:09,523 --> 00:15:11,083
But we believe
that they'll just sit back

308
00:15:11,126 --> 00:15:13,495
and wait to see
if he succeeds or not.

309
00:15:13,532 --> 00:15:15,058
But, sir, that could
plunge Romulus

310
00:15:15,102 --> 00:15:16,936
and Cardassia into war
with the Dominion.

311
00:15:17,007 --> 00:15:18,841
Only if he fails, Lieutenant.

312
00:15:18,878 --> 00:15:22,182
His plan looks like it's got
a fair chance of success.

313
00:15:22,219 --> 00:15:24,281
He's commanding
a fleet of 20 ships

314
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:25,759
manned by combat veterans.

315
00:15:25,794 --> 00:15:28,892
They know the location
of the Founders' homeworld

316
00:15:28,936 --> 00:15:30,303
and they've modified
their cloaks

317
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:33,210
so the Jem'Hadar
can't detect their approach.

318
00:15:33,246 --> 00:15:35,946
It sounds like you're hoping
Tain will succeed.

319
00:15:35,986 --> 00:15:38,184
I never hope for war, Major.

320
00:15:38,225 --> 00:15:41,666
But if it comes,
I'd rather see the Dominion

321
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,192
on the losing side.

322
00:15:43,237 --> 00:15:46,267
However, we have to plan
for the worst.

323
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:51,277
Ben, I want you to evacuate DS9
of all non-essential personnel

324
00:15:51,322 --> 00:15:53,350
and put the <i>Defiant</i>
on standby alert.

325
00:15:53,394 --> 00:15:54,624
Even if Tain succeeds

326
00:15:54,664 --> 00:15:58,400
the Jem'Hadar are going to come
screaming out of the wormhole

327
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,308
looking for revenge,
and they may not be

328
00:16:00,344 --> 00:16:02,406
too particular
who their targets are.

329
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,979
Admiral, we believe
Security Chief Odo

330
00:16:05,055 --> 00:16:07,584
is aboard one
of the Romulan ships.

331
00:16:07,628 --> 00:16:09,599
Odo's message said the runabout

332
00:16:09,633 --> 00:16:11,763
had been caught
in a tractor beam.

333
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,776
That suggests he was captured

334
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:15,438
and taken aboard
one of their ships.

335
00:16:15,481 --> 00:16:16,882
I'd like permission to take

336
00:16:16,917 --> 00:16:18,386
the <i>Defiant</i>
into the Gamma Quadrant

337
00:16:18,421 --> 00:16:20,186
and try to determine
if he's still alive.

338
00:16:20,225 --> 00:16:23,529
I'm sorry about your officer,
but there's nothing we can do.

339
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,799
I want the <i>Defiant</i>
guarding Bajor.

340
00:16:25,838 --> 00:16:28,367
That's your top priority.

341
00:16:28,411 --> 00:16:30,074
Toddman out.

342
00:16:37,734 --> 00:16:41,004
Commander Eddington,
am I correct in assuming

343
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,704
Starfleet is planning to send

344
00:16:42,746 --> 00:16:45,183
substantial reinforcements
to this sector?

345
00:16:45,218 --> 00:16:46,653
Yes, sir.

346
00:16:46,688 --> 00:16:50,094
A task force of nine starships
is due to arrive tomorrow.

347
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,363
Nine starships.

348
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,102
I want the <i>Defiant</i>
prepared to leave

349
00:16:56,178 --> 00:16:58,274
for the Gamma Quadrant
in two hours.

350
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:00,983
Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders
were quite clear on...

351
00:17:01,022 --> 00:17:04,052
I am not going to just
abandon one of my officers.

352
00:17:04,097 --> 00:17:07,036
Toddman's concerned
about the defense of Bajor

353
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,199
and so am I.

354
00:17:08,241 --> 00:17:10,405
If we detect
a Jem'Hadar strike force

355
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,881
heading for the Alpha Quadrant

356
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,046
we'll use the communications
relay to warn DS9.

357
00:17:14,088 --> 00:17:15,455
And we'll do everything we can

358
00:17:15,491 --> 00:17:17,553
to stop them
before they reach the wormhole.

359
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:21,362
I consider this
a volunteer mission

360
00:17:21,405 --> 00:17:23,774
but don't volunteer yet.

361
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,874
There's a good chance
you won't be coming back

362
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:28,513
from this mission.

363
00:17:28,555 --> 00:17:30,685
And even if you do

364
00:17:30,727 --> 00:17:34,760
you'll probably be facing
a general court-martial.

365
00:17:36,808 --> 00:17:38,904
If you do decide to go

366
00:17:38,947 --> 00:17:42,353
be aboard the <i>Defiant</i>
at 1530 hours.

367
00:17:42,388 --> 00:17:44,222
Dismissed.

368
00:18:02,303 --> 00:18:03,362
All stations report.

369
00:18:03,406 --> 00:18:04,636
Tactical ready.

370
00:18:04,675 --> 00:18:06,372
Warp and impulse engines
on line.

371
00:18:06,413 --> 00:18:07,575
Cloaking device standing by.

372
00:18:07,616 --> 00:18:08,812
Helm ready.

373
00:18:08,852 --> 00:18:10,151
Security detachment is aboard

374
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:12,854
and phaser rifles have been
issued to every fire team.

375
00:18:12,895 --> 00:18:14,387
Release docking clamps.

376
00:18:14,432 --> 00:18:16,596
Commander, there's
an incoming priority message

377
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,072
from Starfleet Command.

378
00:18:18,107 --> 00:18:19,337
It's Admiral Toddman.

379
00:18:19,377 --> 00:18:23,615
He's repeating his order
not to enter the Gamma Quadrant.

380
00:18:23,654 --> 00:18:25,955
That's what you think it says.

381
00:18:26,962 --> 00:18:28,363
How can you be sure

382
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:32,306
when a transmission is as
badly garbled as that one?

383
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:35,205
You're right.

384
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:38,117
There's an awful lot
of subspace interference

385
00:18:38,155 --> 00:18:39,214
on this channel.

386
00:18:39,258 --> 00:18:41,229
Must be an ion storm
or something.

387
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,526
Must be.

388
00:18:44,069 --> 00:18:46,097
Aft thrusters, back one-quarter.

389
00:18:46,141 --> 00:18:48,476
Port and starboard
at station keeping.

390
00:19:26,872 --> 00:19:29,868
The cloaking device is operating
within normal parameters.

391
00:19:29,913 --> 00:19:32,511
Set course
for the Founders' homeworld.

392
00:19:32,552 --> 00:19:34,523
Warp eight.

393
00:19:34,557 --> 00:19:37,189
We know that the Founders'
planet lies

394
00:19:37,231 --> 00:19:39,259
at approximately
these coordinates

395
00:19:39,302 --> 00:19:40,896
within the Omarion Nebula.

396
00:19:40,939 --> 00:19:44,071
As you can see, there are
no Jem'Hadar bases nearby.

397
00:19:44,113 --> 00:19:46,277
This means that
even if the Founders

398
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:48,050
did send out a distress call

399
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,650
it would take
at least seven hours

400
00:19:49,693 --> 00:19:50,855
for any help to arrive.

401
00:19:50,896 --> 00:19:52,229
Our plan is to wait

402
00:19:52,267 --> 00:19:54,796
until we've entered orbit
of the Founders' planet

403
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:57,072
then de-cloak and begin
massive bombardment.

404
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,775
Computer analysis indicates

405
00:19:58,815 --> 00:20:00,478
that the planet's crust
will be destroyed

406
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:02,319
within one hour,
and the mantle within five.

407
00:20:02,357 --> 00:20:04,794
Well, that should more than
take care of the Founders.

408
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:05,991
Yes, it should.

409
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:09,097
Unless they have some
planetary defenses

410
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,700
we don't know about.

411
00:20:10,744 --> 00:20:12,647
There is one person here

412
00:20:12,682 --> 00:20:15,883
who might answer
that question... Mr. Odo.

413
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:16,891
Anything he knows

414
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:18,862
about the Founders
and their planet

415
00:20:18,897 --> 00:20:21,870
was undoubtedly included
in his report to Starfleet.

416
00:20:21,904 --> 00:20:23,932
The Constable is
remarkably thorough

417
00:20:23,975 --> 00:20:25,205
in these matters.

418
00:20:25,245 --> 00:20:26,646
There was a time

419
00:20:26,682 --> 00:20:30,248
when you were eager to begin
an interrogation, Elim.

420
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:33,993
In fact, I remember having
to restrain your enthusiasm

421
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:35,434
on several occasions.

422
00:20:35,536 --> 00:20:37,803
Well, then you should
also remember

423
00:20:37,843 --> 00:20:39,608
the pride I took in my work.

424
00:20:39,646 --> 00:20:42,278
I don't think that
interrogating someone

425
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,450
who can alter their form at will

426
00:20:44,492 --> 00:20:47,989
is likely to provide either
amusement or information.

427
00:20:48,033 --> 00:20:51,838
I wouldn't worry about Mr. Odo's
shape-shifting, if I were you.

428
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,405
The Obsidian Order
has developed a device

429
00:20:54,449 --> 00:20:57,855
which should prove quite
effective in neutralizing him.

430
00:20:57,891 --> 00:21:00,489
I was not informed
about this device.

431
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:01,658
It's only a prototype.

432
00:21:01,699 --> 00:21:03,966
We've never had
a chance to test it...

433
00:21:04,005 --> 00:21:06,033
until now.

434
00:21:06,076 --> 00:21:08,309
Perhaps the Tal Shiar
should take over

435
00:21:08,348 --> 00:21:10,444
the interrogation
of the changeling.

436
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,921
No.

437
00:21:11,957 --> 00:21:13,324
It's all right, Garak.

438
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,659
It's my fault.

439
00:21:14,697 --> 00:21:17,100
I should have known
you'd develop feelings

440
00:21:17,136 --> 00:21:19,437
for these people
you've been living with

441
00:21:19,476 --> 00:21:20,809
for the past few years.

442
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:24,047
But I just never expected
that you would become friends

443
00:21:24,086 --> 00:21:26,455
with someone who worked
for the Bajorans.

444
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:30,332
This has nothing to do with
my friends or my feelings.

445
00:21:30,368 --> 00:21:34,310
I simply don't believe he has
the information you want.

446
00:21:34,345 --> 00:21:37,079
Possibly.
Colonel Lovok will find out.

447
00:21:37,117 --> 00:21:38,643
No.

448
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,852
I brought Odo here.

449
00:21:40,894 --> 00:21:45,337
He's my prisoner
and my responsibility.

450
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:46,840
You don't have to do this.

451
00:21:46,874 --> 00:21:48,002
Yes, I do.

452
00:21:48,044 --> 00:21:50,208
And I think we both know

453
00:21:50,249 --> 00:21:53,381
that you won't trust me
until I do.

454
00:21:53,423 --> 00:21:56,123
All right.

455
00:21:56,163 --> 00:21:59,763
I look forward
to hearing your results.

456
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:08,624
Commander, I'm reading
some kind of power fluctuation

457
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,924
in the cloaking device.

458
00:22:09,963 --> 00:22:11,523
What kind of fluctuation?

459
00:22:11,634 --> 00:22:12,762
I don't know.

460
00:22:12,803 --> 00:22:14,534
I can't locate the source
of the problem

461
00:22:14,574 --> 00:22:16,271
but it is getting worse.

462
00:22:16,311 --> 00:22:18,111
We're de-cloaking.

463
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:19,117
All stop.

464
00:22:19,151 --> 00:22:20,450
Full scan, Lieutenant.

465
00:22:20,488 --> 00:22:22,789
Are there any other ships
in the area?

466
00:22:22,827 --> 00:22:24,558
No, nothing in sensor range.

467
00:22:24,632 --> 00:22:27,799
Commander, if the Jem'Hadar show
up while we're de-cloaked...

468
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:30,333
We'll have to fight
our way out of here.

469
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,769
Everything looks fine.

470
00:22:37,811 --> 00:22:40,112
The power converters
are on line.

471
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,679
The projection matrix
looks normal.

472
00:22:42,756 --> 00:22:44,419
The cloaking device
should be working.

473
00:22:44,461 --> 00:22:46,694
Maybe there's some kind
of spatial anomaly nearby

474
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:49,068
that's interfering
with the cloak's power systems.

475
00:22:49,105 --> 00:22:51,976
This isn't the result
of a spatial anomaly, Major.

476
00:22:52,012 --> 00:22:54,712
The tetryon compositor
on the cloaking device

477
00:22:54,752 --> 00:22:55,914
has been sabotaged.

478
00:22:55,955 --> 00:22:57,049
How do you know that?

479
00:22:58,394 --> 00:23:00,194
Because I sabotaged it.

480
00:23:00,232 --> 00:23:01,291
Why?

481
00:23:01,334 --> 00:23:03,669
I was under orders
from Admiral Toddman to stop you

482
00:23:03,774 --> 00:23:05,574
from pursuing
the Romulan/Cardassian fleet.

483
00:23:05,611 --> 00:23:08,607
You've turned us into sitting
ducks for the Jem'Hadar!

484
00:23:08,651 --> 00:23:10,588
But we can still
defend ourselves.

485
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:14,223
I didn't damage any
of the ship's weapon systems

486
00:23:14,265 --> 00:23:15,393
or the engines.

487
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:19,001
But, without the cloak,
we'll have to return to DS9.

488
00:23:19,043 --> 00:23:20,376
I'm sorry, Commander.

489
00:23:20,413 --> 00:23:22,110
I didn't want to do this.

490
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,585
Odo's my friend, too

491
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:26,457
but I report directly
to Admiral Toddman

492
00:23:26,494 --> 00:23:27,929
and he gave me
an explicit order.

493
00:23:27,964 --> 00:23:29,297
I couldn't disobey it.

494
00:23:29,334 --> 00:23:31,065
I don't suppose you could.

495
00:23:31,106 --> 00:23:32,700
Chief...

496
00:23:32,743 --> 00:23:34,372
now that we know
that the problem

497
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:37,545
is in the tetryon compositor,
how long until you can fix it?

498
00:23:37,588 --> 00:23:39,285
About ten hours.

499
00:23:39,325 --> 00:23:40,521
You've got two.

500
00:23:40,561 --> 00:23:41,655
On your way.

501
00:23:48,848 --> 00:23:50,944
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to confine you

502
00:23:50,987 --> 00:23:52,354
to quarters, Mr. Eddington.

503
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,418
Sir, if we run
into the Jem'Hadar

504
00:23:54,461 --> 00:23:57,263
you're still going to need
a Chief Security Officer.

505
00:23:57,301 --> 00:23:59,272
What makes you think
we'll trust you again?

506
00:23:59,306 --> 00:24:02,473
Because I give you my word.

507
00:24:02,514 --> 00:24:06,319
I make it a policy
to never question the word

508
00:24:06,356 --> 00:24:09,124
of anyone who wears
that uniform.

509
00:24:09,163 --> 00:24:12,467
Don't make me
change that policy.

510
00:24:12,505 --> 00:24:14,567
Man your station, Commander.

511
00:24:17,115 --> 00:24:19,747
But... I'd stay out
of the Chief's way

512
00:24:19,789 --> 00:24:21,692
if I were you.

513
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,512
I realize it must be
nearly time for you

514
00:24:32,553 --> 00:24:34,547
to return to your liquid state

515
00:24:34,591 --> 00:24:37,189
so I thought I'd bring you
something to relax in.

516
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,358
How kind.

517
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,268
But before you go for a swim

518
00:24:40,305 --> 00:24:42,538
I have a few questions
I'd like to ask you.

519
00:24:42,577 --> 00:24:43,944
I have nothing to say.

520
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,247
Well, I had hoped
a few hours alone

521
00:24:46,286 --> 00:24:48,689
might jog your memory,
but I can see

522
00:24:48,724 --> 00:24:52,426
I'm going to have to take
some steps I'd hoped to avoid.

523
00:24:52,467 --> 00:24:56,705
Oh, no, you're going to
torture me, aren't you?

524
00:24:56,744 --> 00:24:59,273
How I've been dreading this.

525
00:24:59,317 --> 00:25:01,754
Please, have mercy, Garak.

526
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:05,128
You do have a certain
flair for sarcasm.

527
00:25:05,164 --> 00:25:08,570
It's one of the things
I like about you.

528
00:25:12,247 --> 00:25:13,910
You can go now.

529
00:25:16,091 --> 00:25:18,119
I'd bring those guards
back, if I were you.

530
00:25:18,161 --> 00:25:20,223
I'm not in a very good mood.

531
00:25:20,266 --> 00:25:22,669
Yes, under normal circumstances

532
00:25:22,706 --> 00:25:25,508
you would pose
quite a threat to me.

533
00:25:25,546 --> 00:25:29,419
You could turn yourself
into, uh, a Vicarian razorback

534
00:25:29,455 --> 00:25:32,087
or stretch out your arms

535
00:25:32,129 --> 00:25:35,626
and strangle me
from across the room.

536
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,401
But not this time.

537
00:25:37,441 --> 00:25:40,380
Oh, and why is that?

538
00:25:40,416 --> 00:25:43,788
Because this device is emitting
a quantum stasis field

539
00:25:43,823 --> 00:25:46,056
designed to prevent
any changeling

540
00:25:46,096 --> 00:25:48,898
from altering
his biomolecular structure.

541
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:02,427
Yes.

542
00:26:02,468 --> 00:26:05,532
It must be
very disconcerting for you

543
00:26:05,576 --> 00:26:09,814
to be locked into a humanoid
form, especially now.

544
00:26:09,853 --> 00:26:12,587
I'm sure you were
looking forward

545
00:26:12,626 --> 00:26:15,463
to returning
to your liquid state.

546
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,630
Tell me...

547
00:26:17,671 --> 00:26:21,305
what will happen if you can't
revert to a liquid?

548
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:24,647
I don't know.

549
00:26:24,687 --> 00:26:26,156
An honest answer.

550
00:26:26,192 --> 00:26:30,794
But it's probably safe to say
that it won't be pleasant.

551
00:26:32,874 --> 00:26:34,674
Garak, this is pointless.

552
00:26:34,711 --> 00:26:37,981
There's nothing I can tell you
about the Founders

553
00:26:38,053 --> 00:26:39,750
that you don't already know.

554
00:26:39,791 --> 00:26:41,522
I wish I could believe that.

555
00:26:41,562 --> 00:26:43,999
Then why don't you?

556
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:46,006
Because you and I are so alike.

557
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:48,510
We both value our privacy,
our secrets.

558
00:26:48,545 --> 00:26:51,951
That's why I know there's
something about the Founders

559
00:26:51,987 --> 00:26:53,547
you haven't told anyone.

560
00:26:53,591 --> 00:26:55,824
Something you didn't even share

561
00:26:55,862 --> 00:27:00,202
with Starfleet
and Commander Sisko, hmm?

562
00:27:01,376 --> 00:27:05,147
But you are going to tell me,
Odo.

563
00:27:05,185 --> 00:27:08,090
There's nothing to tell!

564
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:11,998
Well, perhaps something
will come to you.

565
00:27:12,068 --> 00:27:13,537
I can wait.

566
00:27:13,572 --> 00:27:15,736
The question is...

567
00:27:17,414 --> 00:27:18,906
can you?

568
00:27:29,109 --> 00:27:31,046
Major...

569
00:27:31,113 --> 00:27:33,050
leave the Chief alone.

570
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:35,682
What makes you think
I'm going to see O'Brien?

571
00:27:38,364 --> 00:27:39,856
All right,
it's been three hours.

572
00:27:39,902 --> 00:27:41,930
I just wanted to see
if he needed some help.

573
00:27:41,973 --> 00:27:44,069
If he needed help,
he would ask for it.

574
00:27:44,111 --> 00:27:45,842
For now, the best thing
we can do

575
00:27:45,882 --> 00:27:47,819
is to stay out of his way.

576
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,304
What's the matter, Garak?

577
00:28:13,348 --> 00:28:15,444
You don't look very happy.

578
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:17,548
Aren't you enjoying yourself?

579
00:28:17,591 --> 00:28:21,430
There is no pleasure
in this for me, Constable.

580
00:28:21,468 --> 00:28:24,669
I assure you.
I am simply doing my job.

581
00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:26,302
Your job?

582
00:28:26,346 --> 00:28:27,838
Yes!

583
00:28:27,883 --> 00:28:31,483
This job you've been
waiting for...

584
00:28:31,525 --> 00:28:35,330
all... all these years of exile.

585
00:28:35,367 --> 00:28:41,007
And here you are,
interrogating a prisoner again.

586
00:28:41,048 --> 00:28:45,822
It must fill you with pride.

587
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:49,893
Odo, just tell me what I need
to know, and this will end.

588
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:58,447
But... but... but you don't
want it to end, do you, Garak?

589
00:28:58,489 --> 00:29:02,328
Isn't this what you've
been dreaming of?

590
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:04,337
Back at work...

591
00:29:04,371 --> 00:29:07,139
serving Cardassia.

592
00:29:07,211 --> 00:29:08,544
That's right.

593
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:11,052
And you have information
that I need

594
00:29:11,086 --> 00:29:14,549
information that it's my duty
to extract from you.

595
00:29:14,595 --> 00:29:15,859
It's not personal.

596
00:29:21,311 --> 00:29:23,008
Odo, talk to me!

597
00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:25,020
Tell me something!

598
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:27,891
Anything.

599
00:29:27,927 --> 00:29:33,601
Lie if you have to,
but say it now, please.

600
00:29:36,615 --> 00:29:39,588
Home! I want to go home!

601
00:29:39,622 --> 00:29:41,216
And you will, I promise.

602
00:29:41,292 --> 00:29:43,092
As soon as this is all over

603
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:45,601
I promise I'll take you back
to Deep Space 9.

604
00:29:45,636 --> 00:29:48,666
No! Not the station.

605
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:51,113
Home with my people.

606
00:29:51,149 --> 00:29:52,448
The Founders?

607
00:29:52,486 --> 00:29:53,476
Yes.

608
00:29:53,521 --> 00:29:54,854
You want to return
to the Founders?

609
00:29:54,891 --> 00:29:55,881
Yes.

610
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:57,761
I thought you turned
your back on them.

611
00:29:57,798 --> 00:30:00,532
I did, but they're
still my people.

612
00:30:00,571 --> 00:30:02,542
I tried to deny it.

613
00:30:02,576 --> 00:30:04,479
I tried to forget.

614
00:30:04,515 --> 00:30:05,916
But I can't.

615
00:30:05,951 --> 00:30:07,979
They're my people

616
00:30:08,023 --> 00:30:13,297
and I want to be with them
in the Great Link.

617
00:30:13,369 --> 00:30:15,806
I knew there was
something secret

618
00:30:15,842 --> 00:30:17,505
you were holding back.

619
00:30:17,546 --> 00:30:20,850
And now you've found it.

620
00:30:20,887 --> 00:30:24,054
I hope it's useful.

621
00:30:52,354 --> 00:30:53,653
Repairs are complete, sir.

622
00:30:53,691 --> 00:30:55,559
The cloaking device
is on line.

623
00:30:56,932 --> 00:30:59,461
A souvenir of your handiwork.

624
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:02,672
Engage cloak.

625
00:31:02,712 --> 00:31:05,685
The cloak is operating normally.

626
00:31:05,719 --> 00:31:08,088
Resume course
to the Founders' planet.

627
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:09,219
Maximum warp.

628
00:31:09,261 --> 00:31:11,323
Did you get anything
out of him at all?

629
00:31:11,366 --> 00:31:12,460
Nothing.

630
00:31:12,569 --> 00:31:13,936
He never broke.

631
00:31:13,973 --> 00:31:15,203
Well, that's unfortunate.

632
00:31:15,243 --> 00:31:17,339
I see no further use
for Mr. Odo.

633
00:31:17,381 --> 00:31:19,044
Terminate him.

634
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:22,651
On the other hand, he is a
member of the Bajoran Militia

635
00:31:22,693 --> 00:31:24,857
and an officer on Deep Space 9.

636
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:28,499
We may not wish to provoke
the Federation by killing him.

637
00:31:28,607 --> 00:31:29,506
I agree with Garak.

638
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:30,909
Do you?

639
00:31:30,947 --> 00:31:32,712
Yes. There's no way
to be certain

640
00:31:32,751 --> 00:31:36,089
that all of the Founders will be
on the planet when we attack.

641
00:31:36,126 --> 00:31:38,029
We should be prepared
to encounter

642
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:39,864
other changelings in the future.

643
00:31:39,901 --> 00:31:41,769
And we could use
more information

644
00:31:41,806 --> 00:31:43,070
on their capabilities.

645
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:45,546
I want to take Odo back
to Romulus for further study.

646
00:31:45,648 --> 00:31:48,780
All right, in the interest
of cooperation.

647
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,383
Bridge to Colonel Lovok.

648
00:31:50,427 --> 00:31:51,657
This is Lovok.

649
00:31:51,697 --> 00:31:53,132
We have entered
the Omarion Nebula

650
00:31:53,167 --> 00:31:54,329
and dropped out of warp.

651
00:31:54,369 --> 00:31:56,806
We should be in orbit
of the planet in 15 minutes.

652
00:31:56,842 --> 00:31:58,243
Acknowledged.

653
00:31:58,279 --> 00:32:02,415
Well, it seems the moment
is nearly at hand.

654
00:32:02,456 --> 00:32:03,515
Gentlemen.

655
00:32:10,475 --> 00:32:12,776
Can I do something for you,
Colonel?

656
00:32:12,813 --> 00:32:15,216
Why were you trying
to protect the changeling?

657
00:32:15,253 --> 00:32:16,882
I wasn't trying to protect him.

658
00:32:16,923 --> 00:32:18,358
And as I recall, you thought

659
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:20,797
it was a good idea
to keep him alive as well.

660
00:32:20,832 --> 00:32:24,466
My interest in the changeling
is based on what I believe to be

661
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:27,311
the strategic interests
of the Romulan Empire.

662
00:32:27,348 --> 00:32:29,819
But you... you seem to have
a personal interest in him.

663
00:32:29,854 --> 00:32:32,588
Well, tell me,
what else am I feeling?

664
00:32:32,694 --> 00:32:35,998
I've never been psychoanalyzed
by a Romulan before.

665
00:32:36,036 --> 00:32:38,507
This is
a fascinating experience.

666
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:41,106
You are a practiced liar,
Mr. Garak

667
00:32:41,148 --> 00:32:43,278
but I am a practiced observer.

668
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,054
And I can assure you,
I am going to be

669
00:32:46,094 --> 00:32:48,065
observing you very closely.

670
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:58,387
We are within disruptor range.

671
00:32:58,423 --> 00:32:59,983
Scan the planet for life-signs.

672
00:33:00,026 --> 00:33:02,259
Sensors show multiple
life-forms on the surface.

673
00:33:02,298 --> 00:33:03,995
They appear to be
in a liquid state.

674
00:33:04,036 --> 00:33:05,164
The Founders.

675
00:33:05,205 --> 00:33:07,267
Signal the fleet
to charge weapons

676
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:09,041
and lock on to their targets.

677
00:33:09,082 --> 00:33:12,021
We will open fire
the moment we drop our cloaks.

678
00:33:12,055 --> 00:33:14,424
All ships report ready,
all weapons charged.

679
00:33:14,461 --> 00:33:17,867
So much for the Dominion.

680
00:33:17,903 --> 00:33:19,566
Open fire.

681
00:33:23,081 --> 00:33:26,077
The first barrage is complete.

682
00:33:26,123 --> 00:33:27,148
Effect?

683
00:33:27,192 --> 00:33:29,026
30 percent
of the planetary crust

684
00:33:29,063 --> 00:33:31,057
destroyed on opening volley.

685
00:33:31,101 --> 00:33:33,402
No change in life-form readings.

686
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,568
What?

687
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:36,102
That's impossible.

688
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:37,878
Some of them had to be killed.

689
00:33:37,917 --> 00:33:39,409
Our sensor readings
have been confirmed

690
00:33:39,454 --> 00:33:40,684
by three other warbirds.

691
00:33:40,724 --> 00:33:43,059
There's no change in the number
of life-signs on the surface.

692
00:33:43,096 --> 00:33:45,397
They're using
an automated transponder

693
00:33:45,436 --> 00:33:47,566
to send back
false sensor readings.

694
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:49,009
The planet's deserted!

695
00:33:49,044 --> 00:33:50,274
Colonel, signal the fleet...

696
00:33:50,313 --> 00:33:52,511
Colonel, there are ships
coming out of the nebula.

697
00:33:52,553 --> 00:33:53,578
What type of ships?

698
00:33:53,622 --> 00:33:54,612
Jem'Hadar fighters.

699
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:55,284
How many?

700
00:33:57,063 --> 00:33:58,623
I asked you a question!

701
00:33:58,667 --> 00:34:00,934
One hundred fifty.

702
00:34:04,949 --> 00:34:06,783
Tactical display on screen.

703
00:34:08,624 --> 00:34:10,321
It's a trap.

704
00:34:10,361 --> 00:34:13,927
They've been waiting
for us all along.

705
00:34:34,319 --> 00:34:37,691
The Cardassian Cruiser <i>Koranak</i>
has been destroyed.

706
00:34:37,728 --> 00:34:40,199
Romulan Warbirds <i>Makar</i>
and <i>Belak</i> have lost main power.

707
00:34:40,233 --> 00:34:42,204
Bring us about to 318 mark 215.

708
00:34:42,238 --> 00:34:43,206
Concentrate fire

709
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,302
on ships attacking
on the port quarter.

710
00:34:46,715 --> 00:34:49,186
The Jem'Hadar will destroy
every ship if we stay!

711
00:34:49,222 --> 00:34:51,693
Our only hope is to return
to the Alpha Quadrant!

712
00:34:51,727 --> 00:34:54,164
There's no way
out of here, Garak.

713
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,692
The Jem'Hadar have cut us off.

714
00:34:55,737 --> 00:34:58,437
We need to consolidate the fleet
and make our stand here.

715
00:34:58,477 --> 00:35:00,505
How could this be?
What could have happened?

716
00:35:00,549 --> 00:35:03,921
I'm afraid the fault, dear Tain,
is not in our stars

717
00:35:03,956 --> 00:35:04,924
but in ourselves.

718
00:35:04,959 --> 00:35:05,927
What?!

719
00:35:05,961 --> 00:35:08,957
Something I learned
from Dr. Bashir.

720
00:35:09,002 --> 00:35:10,198
Main power's out.

721
00:35:10,238 --> 00:35:11,764
Switching to emergency backups.

722
00:35:11,842 --> 00:35:14,781
Bridge to Engineering.
We need power to the weapons.

723
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:17,652
Bridge to Engineering,
respond!

724
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:19,057
I'll be in Engineering.

725
00:35:19,093 --> 00:35:21,030
Tain, take command
of the Bridge.

726
00:35:21,064 --> 00:35:24,937
Four more Jem'Hadar vessels
closing on our position.

727
00:35:52,473 --> 00:35:54,444
I take it the attack
on the Founders

728
00:35:54,478 --> 00:35:56,472
is not proceeding
according to plan.

729
00:35:56,516 --> 00:35:59,752
No, it's not, but I suggest
we make our way to the runabout.

730
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,125
For once, Garak,
I agree with you.

731
00:36:04,735 --> 00:36:07,572
You'll need this in order to
gain access to your runabout.

732
00:36:09,314 --> 00:36:10,749
Why are you doing this?

733
00:36:10,784 --> 00:36:14,054
Because no changeling
has ever harmed another.

734
00:36:14,091 --> 00:36:16,221
You are one of the Founders?

735
00:36:16,264 --> 00:36:17,358
Of course.

736
00:36:17,399 --> 00:36:18,424
This whole plan

737
00:36:18,469 --> 00:36:21,408
was the Founders' idea
in the first place.

738
00:36:21,443 --> 00:36:24,713
You wanted the Tal Shiar
and the Obsidian Order

739
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:28,156
to combine forces
and come into the Gamma Quadrant

740
00:36:28,192 --> 00:36:30,060
so you could wipe them out.

741
00:36:30,097 --> 00:36:32,068
Not exactly...
Tain originated the plan

742
00:36:32,102 --> 00:36:33,469
and when we learned of it

743
00:36:33,505 --> 00:36:35,999
we did everything
we could to carry it forward.

744
00:36:36,044 --> 00:36:38,015
The Tal Shiar
and the Obsidian Order

745
00:36:38,049 --> 00:36:40,179
are both ruthless,
efficient organizations.

746
00:36:40,221 --> 00:36:42,488
A definite threat to us.

747
00:36:42,526 --> 00:36:44,463
But not after today.

748
00:36:44,498 --> 00:36:46,401
After today,
the only real threat to us

749
00:36:46,436 --> 00:36:47,564
from the Alpha Quadrant

750
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:49,370
are the Klingons
and the Federation.

751
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:51,381
And I doubt that either of them

752
00:36:51,415 --> 00:36:53,545
will be a threat
for much longer.

753
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,904
It is not too late for you, Odo.

754
00:37:02,942 --> 00:37:05,140
Come with me.

755
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,912
You can still become one

756
00:37:06,951 --> 00:37:09,320
with the Great Link,
if you wish.

757
00:37:13,166 --> 00:37:14,829
Thank you.

758
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:17,741
But my answer is still no.

759
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,430
Come on!

760
00:37:28,469 --> 00:37:30,098
I don't think we have much time.

761
00:37:30,141 --> 00:37:31,109
The runabout is that way.

762
00:37:31,143 --> 00:37:32,271
Two decks down, section 25.

763
00:37:32,312 --> 00:37:33,280
Wait for me there.

764
00:37:33,314 --> 00:37:34,282
Where are you going?

765
00:37:34,317 --> 00:37:35,479
To the Bridge, to get Tain.

766
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,488
What?

767
00:37:36,523 --> 00:37:37,513
I know it's difficult

768
00:37:37,558 --> 00:37:39,118
for you to understand,
Constable

769
00:37:39,162 --> 00:37:40,893
but I still owe him
a personal debt

770
00:37:40,933 --> 00:37:42,334
and I have to try to repay it.

771
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:44,238
Wait for us as long as you can.

772
00:37:48,618 --> 00:37:51,956
Tain! We have to go!

773
00:37:52,962 --> 00:37:54,762
There must have been
an informant.

774
00:37:54,799 --> 00:37:56,599
That's the only explanation.

775
00:37:56,637 --> 00:37:59,269
Yes, there was an informant.
You're right.

776
00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:00,780
Colonel Lovok is a changeling.

777
00:38:00,814 --> 00:38:01,976
Lovok?

778
00:38:02,016 --> 00:38:04,716
Yes, but that's something
we can discuss at another time.

779
00:38:04,756 --> 00:38:05,918
Right now, we have to...

780
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,124
It appears I have
underestimated the Founders.

781
00:38:08,165 --> 00:38:09,566
I should have seen it coming.

782
00:38:09,602 --> 00:38:11,596
There was a time
when nothing got past me.

783
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,109
You remember, don't you, Elim?

784
00:38:13,143 --> 00:38:14,737
Yes, I do!

785
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:17,217
But now we have to go!

786
00:38:17,254 --> 00:38:18,244
Go where?

787
00:38:18,289 --> 00:38:20,590
Back to Mila
and my quiet retirement?

788
00:38:20,628 --> 00:38:21,722
I don't think so.

789
00:38:21,764 --> 00:38:23,165
I must be getting old.

790
00:38:23,201 --> 00:38:27,006
I let my pride
override my instinct.

791
00:38:27,043 --> 00:38:29,241
Wouldn't have played it
that way in the old days.

792
00:38:29,282 --> 00:38:31,880
In the old days, I would have
kept Lovok at arm's length.

793
00:38:31,922 --> 00:38:34,052
He was too cagey, too smart.

794
00:38:34,093 --> 00:38:36,930
I can't just leave you here!

795
00:38:36,967 --> 00:38:39,633
I always did have
a soft spot for you, Garak.

796
00:38:39,674 --> 00:38:40,870
Another of my flaws.

797
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:43,347
Enabran!

798
00:38:45,688 --> 00:38:49,630
These Founders, Elim,
they're very good.

799
00:38:49,664 --> 00:38:53,230
Next time,
we should be more careful.

800
00:38:56,109 --> 00:38:58,980
You can be very persuasive
on occasion, Constable.

801
00:38:59,016 --> 00:39:00,041
But in the future

802
00:39:00,086 --> 00:39:02,888
I hope you'll consider
using gentler language.

803
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:04,418
I'll keep that in mind.

804
00:39:04,463 --> 00:39:06,593
A Jem'Hadar ship
is following us.

805
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:08,799
Raise shields
and charge the weapons.

806
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,640
Aft shields down to 50 percent.

807
00:39:10,677 --> 00:39:13,080
More speed would be advisable.

808
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:15,520
The warp drive is off-line.

809
00:39:17,427 --> 00:39:19,455
Shields down to 30 percent!

810
00:39:19,499 --> 00:39:22,871
Another Jem'Hadar ship is
approaching to starboard.

811
00:39:22,906 --> 00:39:23,874
Hang on!

812
00:39:23,909 --> 00:39:26,210
Shields down to 15 percent.

813
00:39:28,019 --> 00:39:31,323
Main power is failing.
We're losing speed.

814
00:39:33,131 --> 00:39:35,568
The shields are gone.

815
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:39,543
Odo, I hope
that you will accept

816
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:43,579
my sincere apologies
for all this.

817
00:39:43,623 --> 00:39:45,423
A little late, isn't it?

818
00:39:45,461 --> 00:39:47,455
Nevertheless.

819
00:39:51,141 --> 00:39:53,544
I may not agree
with what you did

820
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:57,920
but I can certainly understand
your desire to return home.

821
00:39:57,957 --> 00:39:59,153
Thank you.

822
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:01,720
What?

823
00:40:10,354 --> 00:40:12,348
Three more coming in
off the port bow.

824
00:40:12,392 --> 00:40:15,024
Fire on the lead ship, then
bring us back to the runabout.

825
00:40:18,073 --> 00:40:19,873
Two life-signs on
the runabout, Commander.

826
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:20,878
Drop shields.

827
00:40:20,913 --> 00:40:22,177
Bridge to Transporter Room.

828
00:40:22,215 --> 00:40:23,343
Beam them aboard, Chief.

829
00:40:23,385 --> 00:40:24,854
Aye, sir.

830
00:40:24,888 --> 00:40:27,690
Four more Jem'Hadar ships
closing to starboard.

831
00:40:27,762 --> 00:40:29,288
O'Brien to Bridge.
I've got them.

832
00:40:29,332 --> 00:40:30,391
Raise shields.

833
00:40:30,435 --> 00:40:32,098
Welcome back.

834
00:40:32,139 --> 00:40:33,233
Thank you.

835
00:40:33,275 --> 00:40:34,710
Oh, that looks painful.

836
00:40:34,779 --> 00:40:38,686
It is,
but it did save my life.

837
00:40:41,428 --> 00:40:43,331
Shields at 80 percent.

838
00:40:43,366 --> 00:40:44,460
Attack pattern Omega four.

839
00:40:44,503 --> 00:40:45,870
Full impulse power.

840
00:40:45,905 --> 00:40:48,274
Hold your fire until we're
within 500 meters.

841
00:40:48,311 --> 00:40:50,748
We might get pretty singed
at that range.

842
00:40:52,455 --> 00:40:54,756
Not as singed
as they're going to get.

843
00:40:54,794 --> 00:40:55,784
Engage!

844
00:40:58,335 --> 00:41:00,431
50,000 meters and closing.

845
00:41:04,651 --> 00:41:06,211
2,000 meters.

846
00:41:07,758 --> 00:41:08,657
Five hundred.

847
00:41:08,693 --> 00:41:09,558
Fire!

848
00:41:22,994 --> 00:41:25,158
The third Jem'Hadar ship
is still pursuing.

849
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:26,668
Aft torpedoes, fire!

850
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:29,976
Direct hit
on their port nacelle.

851
00:41:30,011 --> 00:41:32,278
They're losing speed.

852
00:41:32,316 --> 00:41:34,013
We're out
of their weapons range.

853
00:41:34,054 --> 00:41:35,148
Any other signs of pursuit?

854
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,158
Negative.

855
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:38,323
The other fighters
are still concentrating

856
00:41:38,365 --> 00:41:40,700
on the remaining Romulan
and Cardassian ships.

857
00:41:40,737 --> 00:41:43,505
Let's not wait around for them
to change their minds.

858
00:41:43,544 --> 00:41:45,301
Set course for the wormhole,
Lieutenant, warp eight.

859
00:41:49,846 --> 00:41:52,215
It's good to see you again,
Constable.

860
00:41:52,251 --> 00:41:53,276
Likewise, Major.

861
00:41:53,321 --> 00:41:54,585
Course laid in.

862
00:41:56,996 --> 00:41:58,990
Engage.

863
00:42:03,545 --> 00:42:05,208
There is still no indication

864
00:42:05,249 --> 00:42:07,345
that any Romulan
or Cardassian vessel

865
00:42:07,387 --> 00:42:08,822
survived the attack.

866
00:42:08,857 --> 00:42:11,158
Sounds like Wolf 359
all over again.

867
00:42:11,197 --> 00:42:12,757
I had the same thought.

868
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,366
You may be interested to know
I've decided not to file charges

869
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:17,810
against anyone
aboard the <i>Defiant.</i>

870
00:42:17,846 --> 00:42:19,646
Thank you, sir.

871
00:42:19,684 --> 00:42:21,347
But if you pull a stunt
like that again

872
00:42:21,388 --> 00:42:23,291
I'll court-martial you
or I'll promote you.

873
00:42:23,326 --> 00:42:25,354
Either way, you'll be
in a lot of trouble.

874
00:42:25,398 --> 00:42:27,869
I'll keep that in mind, sir.

875
00:43:00,849 --> 00:43:04,517
I just read the report
that you wrote

876
00:43:04,557 --> 00:43:06,790
and I wanted to thank you.

877
00:43:06,829 --> 00:43:10,030
Me? For what?

878
00:43:10,071 --> 00:43:16,610
For not mentioning my desire
to return to my people.

879
00:43:16,653 --> 00:43:18,920
I consider
the entire conversation

880
00:43:18,958 --> 00:43:22,957
as something...
best forgotten.

881
00:43:23,002 --> 00:43:24,494
As do I.

882
00:43:26,344 --> 00:43:30,251
Quark has expressed an interest
in renting this space

883
00:43:30,286 --> 00:43:32,154
if you're not going
to be using it.

884
00:43:32,191 --> 00:43:33,319
Oh?

885
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:34,830
He mentioned something

886
00:43:34,864 --> 00:43:37,131
about an Argelian
massage facility.

887
00:43:37,169 --> 00:43:40,165
Unfortunately, I don't think
Commander Sisko would approve

888
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:43,912
of such an interesting facility
on the Promenade.

889
00:43:43,952 --> 00:43:45,946
I tend to agree.

890
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:50,160
But I do think he would
approve of a tailor's shop.

891
00:43:51,404 --> 00:43:55,540
Do you know
what the sad part is, Odo?

892
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:58,074
I'm a very good tailor.

893
00:44:03,331 --> 00:44:05,199
Garak...

894
00:44:05,236 --> 00:44:09,508
I was thinking that you and I

895
00:44:09,547 --> 00:44:12,452
should have breakfast
together sometime.

896
00:44:12,487 --> 00:44:14,252
Why, Constable...

897
00:44:14,292 --> 00:44:16,559
I thought you didn't eat.

898
00:44:16,597 --> 00:44:18,500
I don't.
