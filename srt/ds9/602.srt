00:00:01,877 --> 00:00:04,212
SISKO:
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

2
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:06,340
<i>O'Brien needed three days</i>
<i>to restore main power</i>

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,175
<i>to our commandeered</i>
<i>Dominion ship</i>

4
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:10,177
<i>but he's not going to get them.</i>

5
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:12,638
<i>Sensors have detected</i>
<i>two Jem'Hadar fighters</i>

6
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:14,556
<i>heading our way,</i>
<i>and without main power</i>

7
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:18,059
<i>our chances of survival</i>
<i>are slim to none.</i>

8
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:21,689
Try it now.

9
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:23,148
Reroute the
damned gyrodyne

10
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,483
through the damned
thruster array.

11
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:25,693
Got it.

12
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,569
Mr. Garak, where are
those ships now?

13
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:32,324
Bearing 310 mark 215,
still closing.

14
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:35,035
O'BRIEN:
Nog, did you reroute
that damned gyrodyne?

15
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,704
NOG:
I'm trying, but
the damned thruster array

16
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:38,163
won't take the input.

17
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,623
Try the lateral
impulse thrusters.

18
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:40,666
And watch your mouth.

19
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,292
Access the auxiliary core

20
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,211
through the starboard
engineering console.

21
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:45,546
I've already tried that.

22
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:48,131
Still no power to
weapons or shields.

23
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,009
Dax, there's
a dark matter nebula

24
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:51,969
60 degrees above the bow.
Can we reach it?

25
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,345
Yes, but that nebula's
never been charted.

26
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:54,972
We don't know what's in there.

27
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:58,350
The Jem'Hadar ships
are entering weapons range.

28
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:03,647
Dax!

29
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:05,232
Get us into
the nebula.

30
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:06,274
Full impulse!

31
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:07,693
(<i> yells</i> )

32
00:01:18,037 --> 00:01:20,539
Sisko to Bashir,
medical emergency.

33
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,124
Helm control's gone.

34
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,932
Okay, all right.

35
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:41,309
You'll be feeling
better any second now.

36
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,564
She's got a puncture
of the right abdominal cavity.

37
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:48,901
It looks as thought the symbiont
may have been injured.

38
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:53,614
Sensors are gone,
impulse engines off-line.

39
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:54,823
In fact, everything's off-line.

40
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:57,117
Emergency power's
holding for now.

41
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,994
Mr. Garak, take a look outside.

42
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:00,079
Just a moment.

43
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,162
SISKO:
Chief, what happened?

44
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:02,497
O'BRIEN:
I don't know.

45
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,624
We must have been hit
by some kind

46
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:04,792
of gravitational
spike in the--

47
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:05,751
Oh, no!

48
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:06,794
Mr. Garak?

49
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:08,837
Hold on!

50
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,676
We have established
a defense perimeter

51
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,637
around the entrance
to the cavern.

52
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,807
I have sent two patrols
to reconnoiter the shoreline

53
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,017
in both directions.

54
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:31,813
The Vorta's condition
has worsened.

55
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,232
He will die soon.

56
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:35,067
What about the First
and the Second?

57
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:37,402
I vaporized their bodies myself

58
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,987
and redistributed
their equipment

59
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,030
to the rest of the men.

60
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,323
You are now the First.

61
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:45,077
No. I questioned
the Vorta's orders.

62
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:46,745
He will not forget that.

63
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:50,707
As long as he lives,
I will remain Third.

64
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,918
You were right
to question him.

65
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:55,045
If he had not ordered us
into the nebula two days ago

66
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,130
we would not have crashed.

67
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,673
It was not my place.

68
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:02,677
Remember,
obedience brings victory.

69
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,640
And victory is life.

70
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,391
Until we reestablish
communications

71
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,977
we will hold this world
for the Dominion.

72
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:12,437
And if we cannot
reestablish communications?

73
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,940
Then we will hold this world
for the Dominion...

74
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,900
until we die.

75
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,537
(<i> coughing</i> )

76
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,710
(<i> coughing</i> )

77
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,551
(<i> coughing and gasping</i> )

78
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:50,517
Cadet, this is no time

79
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:51,852
to lie down on the job.

80
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,021
(<i> coughs</i> )

81
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:58,859
SISKO:
Heave!

82
00:05:58,859 --> 00:05:59,776
(<i> all groaning</i> )

83
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,736
One more, now--
heave!

84
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:05,782
(<i> all sighing and panting</i> )

85
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:17,836
All right, how is she?

86
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,047
She's stable for now.

87
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:22,590
Garak! I need a hand.

88
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,731
Oh, no.

89
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,524
What?

90
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,151
I don't believe it.

91
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,443
What?

92
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:45,072
I tore my pants.

93
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:49,034
You... you tore your pants.

94
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,705
Yeah, I tore my pants.

95
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,707
(<i> chuckling</i> )

96
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:01,755
(<i> laughing</i> ):
I guess...

97
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:04,007
I guess I'm really
in trouble now, huh?

98
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,759
(<i> all laughing</i> )

99
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,483
COMPUTER:
The time is 0500 hours.

100
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,662
(<i> call button beeps</i> )

101
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,864
Thank you, Mavek.

102
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,622
VORTA:
This must be

103
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,459
quite gratifying for you

104
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:24,796
but I've decided not to give you
the pleasure of watching me die

105
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,756
in this foul-smelling cavern.

106
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,344
I intend to live.

107
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:31,886
I understand.

108
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,725
How long until we've
reestablished communications?

109
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:41,980
Seventh Yak'Talon estimates that
it will take at least ten days

110
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,149
before we can attempt
a low-power test.

111
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,485
Ten days.

112
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,611
(<i> coughs</i> )

113
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:52,699
It is time for the white.

114
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:55,910
(<i> groans</i> )

115
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,438
Third Remata'Klan...

116
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,899
can you vouch
for the loyalty of your men?

117
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,945
We pledge our loyalty
to the Founders

118
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,697
from now until death.

119
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:38,578
Then receive this reward
from the Founders.

120
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,999
May it keep
you strong.

121
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:45,919
Only one?

122
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,588
Keep your place.

123
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:54,553
This case of white must last
until we're rescued--

124
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:55,887
at least ten days

125
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:57,305
possibly more.

126
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,933
I will ration
the supply.

127
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,437
Don't worry.

128
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:05,813
I am the Vorta.

129
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:08,733
I will take care of you all.

130
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,655
(<i> coughs weakly</i> )

131
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:22,956
GARAK:
Lucky for you, it
ripped on the seam.

132
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,249
Can you fix it?

133
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,625
Unlucky for you

134
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,668
my sewing kit went
down with the ship.

135
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,712
WOMAN:
Maybe someone could go get it.

136
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,382
The ship's only about 500
meters below the surface.

137
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,092
O'BRIEN:
How long can you hold
your breath, Cadet?

138
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:39,764
Madame, your pants
are ready.

139
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,350
Your boots and vest will
take a little longer.

140
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,560
While you wait

141
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,520
I might suggest
that you browse

142
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,730
through the hotel's
gift shop.

143
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,609
No, thank you

144
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:54,695
but I would like
to lodge a complaint.

145
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:55,738
Hmm?

146
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,949
This bed is
as hard as a rock.

147
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:00,952
I will make
note of that.

148
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,662
What's the prognosis?

149
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,622
Guarded, but good.

150
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:04,998
The bleeding's stopped

151
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,292
and I've repaired all
the internal injuries.

152
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,210
The damage
to the symbiont

153
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,753
is a little harder
to diagnose.

154
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,255
Given enough rest

155
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,841
I think they'll both
make a full recovery.

156
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:19,638
In other words, I'm going to be
staring at this cave ceiling

157
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,473
for the rest
of my stay.

158
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:24,851
Lucky for you,
they have 24-hour
room service.

159
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,604
(<i> giggles, then gasps in pain)</i>

160
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:29,981
I will get you

161
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:33,276
out of here, old man, I promise.

162
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:36,571
I'm going to hold you
to that one, Benjamin.

163
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,698
(<i> tricorders beeping softly</i> )

164
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:56,508
What are you doing?

165
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:58,259
Following orders.

166
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,845
Captain told us to scan the area
for fresh water and vegetation--

167
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,263
You know precisely

168
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,598
what I mean.

169
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:04,807
You're deliberately
staying behind me

170
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,560
and I want
to know why.

171
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:09,312
Does this have anything to do

172
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:12,148
with that unfortunate business
between you and me last year?

173
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,192
You tied me up
and threatened to kill me.

174
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,570
There were extenuating
circumstances.

175
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,238
It happened.

176
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:21,824
So you can either stay in front
of me or walk beside me

177
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,702
but I won't turn my back
on you again.

178
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:28,831
Cadet, there may be
hope for you yet.

179
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,002
(<i> beeping loudly</i> )

180
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,128
What is it?

181
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,255
I'm not sure, but--

182
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,969
Now I'm sure.

183
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,810
How many others
are there in your unit?

184
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,521
Nog--

185
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:55,275
Cadet Third Class,
serial number CX-937--

186
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,317
Shut up.

187
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,196
As I tried to explain
to your men

188
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,365
my name is Kamar,
and I'm a member

189
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,618
of the Cardassian
Intelligence Bureau--

190
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:07,203
what used to be called
the Obsidian Order.

191
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,623
A week ago, as I was
performing my duties

192
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:12,041
in the glorious service
of the Founders

193
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,043
I was captured
by the USS<i> Centaur.</i>

194
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,503
I was held aboard

195
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,297
one of their shuttles
when we were forced--

196
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,424
Excuse me, Mr. Kamar--

197
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:22,510
if that's really your name--

198
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:28,349
but if you're one of our allies,
why were you wearing this?

199
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:31,770
Ah.

200
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:35,940
I was hoping you weren't going
to ask me about that.

201
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,193
I only have one
further question for you.

202
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:43,197
Is there a doctor in your unit?

203
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,951
Yes.

204
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,495
Garak!

205
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:51,665
Don't be too hard on him,
young man.

206
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,792
He just saved your life.

207
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:58,797
Take them to a secure area.

208
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:01,424
(<i> breathing shallowly</i> )

209
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,217
Third...

210
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,263
I have a mission for you.

211
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,684
I want you to find
the Starfleet unit

212
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:14,228
but do not engage them.

213
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,272
Locate them...

214
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:20,318
assess their strength
and then report back to me.

215
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:22,111
I understand.

216
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:25,156
No, you don't.

217
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:27,033
But that's all right.

218
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,994
It's not important
that you understand--

219
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:33,665
only that you carry out
my instructions precisely.

220
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:36,083
Obedience brings victory.

221
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,420
Yes...

222
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,381
yes, it does.

223
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:44,509
Go.

224
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,935
JAKE:
I understand
that a decision's been made

225
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:58,981
to send 4,000 Dominion
facilitators down to Bajor.

226
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,608
Would you care to elaborate?

227
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,403
It's only 400, and how
did you hear about that?

228
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,071
The official announcement

229
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,447
isn't scheduled
until tomorrow.

230
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,574
I hear things.

231
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,200
So could you
elaborate?

232
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,244
My readers want to know
what's going on.

233
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,953
You don't have any readers.

234
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,330
Weyoun is still blocking

235
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,124
the transmission
of your stories.

236
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,126
For now, but what
if he changes his mind?

237
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,545
Don't you want to explain

238
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:23,464
what's going on here
to the outside world?

239
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,218
Ever since
the war started

240
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:29,262
Bajor's been
completely cut off

241
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,764
from all outside trade.

242
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,515
We've had nowhere to turn

243
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:36,436
for things like spare parts
or medical supplies, nowhere--

244
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,479
except the Dominion.

245
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:42,567
So a group of facilitators is
going to Bajor for a few months

246
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:44,903
to provide
some technical
assistance.

247
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:47,405
How do you respond to critics
like Vedek Yassim

248
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:51,075
who say that by welcoming
a group of Vorta to Bajor

249
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,619
you're taking
the first step

250
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,120
towards Dominion
occupation?

251
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,371
I have been assured

252
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,498
that the facilitators
will be unarmed

253
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,376
and unaccompanied
by any Jem'Hadar soldiers.

254
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,213
Odo, do you have any concerns

255
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:08,259
that by joining the Ruling
Council here on the station

256
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,845
you're validating
the occupation?

257
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:13,807
The Dominion doesn't need
my validation.

258
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:16,517
They're here, and
they're not leaving--

259
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,645
not without a fight,
at least.

260
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:19,687
Are you finished?

261
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,481
Almost, almost.

262
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,399
Will either of you
be attending

263
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,192
the demonstration
tomorrow?

264
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,862
The what?

265
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:31,115
Vedek Yassim has organized
a demonstration

266
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,493
on the Promenade
tomorrow afternoon

267
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,745
to protest
the Dominion occupation

268
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,079
of the station.

269
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,874
That's all the excuse
Dukat will need

270
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:42,084
to order a new
security crackdown.

271
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,711
I'll talk to Yassim.

272
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:47,548
So, you're going to abolish
the right to protest

273
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:48,675
here on the station?

274
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:51,135
Hey, I'm not trying

275
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,638
to accuse you personally
of anything.

276
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:56,140
I'm just asking questions.

277
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,517
I think this interview

278
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:58,518
is over.

279
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,311
I couldn't agree more.

280
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,731
(<i> sighs</i> )

281
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,318
Wrong question,
Jake.

282
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,906
O'BRIEN:
I might be able to hard-wire

283
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:14,325
one of our combadges
into this sensor array.

284
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:15,576
That would give us

285
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,829
a crude transmitter,
but no power source.

286
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:20,247
What about draining
one of our phasers?

287
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,416
I thought about that,
but I need a converter

288
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,920
to bridge the two power cells,
and I can't build a converter

289
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,296
without an ion-exchange
matrix.

290
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,131
Captain, I think
we may have a problem.

291
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,133
Garak and Nog
haven't reported in yet

292
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,593
and they're not
answering my hails.

293
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:04,876
Captain, there's a group
of life-forms up in the cliffs.

294
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:07,086
Range 75 meters,
elevation 30 meters.

295
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,880
SISKO:
That's where I'd be.

296
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,090
Are they Jem'Hadar?

297
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,759
I think so.

298
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,135
Well, let's not
make it easy for them.

299
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:19,057
Tell the Chief to head toward
that large outcropping of rocks

300
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:20,349
at ten o'clock.

301
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,434
Walk, don't run.

302
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,898
(<i> quietly</i> ):
Chief...

303
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:29,191
we need to make
for those rocks up ahead.

304
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,290
I can't take it!

305
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,444
Terminate fire!

306
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:14,695
Terminate!

307
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,238
(<i> weapons fire continues</i> )

308
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,449
You have been ordered
to stop firing!

309
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,454
Your orders were clear.

310
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:25,706
You were not
to engage the enemy.

311
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:26,916
Who fired first?

312
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,501
I did.

313
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,169
You are reduced to Sixth.

314
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,629
You will shroud

315
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,213
and return to base camp.

316
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:36,092
I am no longer able
to shroud myself.

317
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:39,261
(<i> weapons fire continues</i> )

318
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,600
You, you.

319
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,061
Provide suppression fire
as we withdraw.

320
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:48,062
Understood.

321
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:50,106
Withdraw!

322
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:55,069
Remata'Klan

323
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,612
I regret my
disobedience.

324
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,621
Are they pulling out?

325
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:06,789
Looks that way.

326
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,332
Why aren't they camouflaged?

327
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,084
That's a good question.

328
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:13,212
Let's hope the answer is
something in our favor.

329
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,465
Cease fire!

330
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:20,678
VORTA:
Why were my orders disobeyed?

331
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:23,389
Lack of white produces
anxiety among us.

332
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,099
One man

333
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,809
could not restrain himself
when he saw the enemy.

334
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:27,852
Which man?

335
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:29,603
I have dealt with the matter.

336
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,438
I asked for his name!

337
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,566
He is my responsibility.

338
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,109
His name!

339
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:43,659
I may not be First,
but I am the unit leader.

340
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,079
You may discipline me.

341
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,706
But only<i> I</i> discipline the men.

342
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:51,125
That is the order of things.

343
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:56,881
Very well.

344
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:59,008
I'll leave him to you.

345
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:01,177
Dismissed.

346
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:07,516
You've done well, Third.

347
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,519
You may yet become First.

348
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,439
Now...

349
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:18,318
I have a new task for you.

350
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:25,201
The Dominion is evil

351
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:28,704
and the Prophets tell us
that evil must be opposed.

352
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,249
You'll get no argument
from me, Vedek

353
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:35,086
but protests and demonstrations
aren't going to change anything.

354
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:37,964
They're just going to cause
trouble for everyone.

355
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:40,800
Then what would you have us do
to oppose the Dominion?

356
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,884
I...

357
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,013
I don't think there's anything

358
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,891
you or the other Vedeks
can do right now.

359
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:50,935
I see.

360
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:53,229
Then as a Bajoran
Liaison Officer

361
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,648
what will you be doing
to fight the Dominion?

362
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,566
Fighting isn't an option.

363
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:03,363
This is different than
the Cardassian occupation.

364
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:05,032
Is it?

365
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:08,327
The Cardassians are in control
of the station.

366
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:12,414
Bajoran freedoms are being
curtailed one by one.

367
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,292
And soon the first wave

368
00:22:14,292 --> 00:22:17,461
of alien troops will be
landing on our world.

369
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:20,798
We're talking about
unarmed Vorta facilitators.

370
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:23,926
They come in, they do their job
and they're gone.

371
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:26,846
Can't you see
what is happening to you?

372
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:30,850
You're becoming an apologist
for them, a defender of evil.

373
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,895
What will it take
to make you act, Kira?

374
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:38,398
To stop accepting them
and start fighting back?

375
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:39,525
Vedek, you...

376
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,321
you just don't understand.

377
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,702
You are right.

378
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,537
I don't.

379
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,498
Maybe tomorrow...

380
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,750
we will both understand.

381
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:06,219
We'll set up three
defensive positions.

382
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:08,262
You and Ensign Gordon
on the south ridge.

383
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:10,681
Lieutenant Neeley
near the lava tube.

384
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:13,934
Bashir and I are
in the dunes.

385
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,103
I'll stay here
and guard my clothes.

386
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:17,313
(<i> on communicator</i> )
Neeley to Captain Sisko.

387
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:19,023
Go ahead.

388
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:22,026
A Jem'Hadar soldier has just
approached my position, sir.

389
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:24,904
He says he wants
to talk to you... alone.

390
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,924
NEELEY:
Sir?

391
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,934
I'm Captain
Benjamin Sisko.

392
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,394
Third Remata'Klan.

393
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:58,271
Two members of your unit

394
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:00,606
are being held
at our base camp.

395
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:03,692
We'll exchange them for
you and your doctor.

396
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,611
Why do you need a doctor?

397
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,571
The Vorta has been
severely wounded.

398
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:08,948
And why me?

399
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,284
The Vorta wishes
to speak with you.

400
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:12,868
Sounds like he wants to trade

401
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:16,663
two low-ranking prisoners
for two more valuable ones.

402
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:18,416
Would you make
a deal like that?

403
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:19,457
No.

404
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:21,252
Then why should I?

405
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:22,753
You shouldn't.

406
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:26,590
You're not a very good
negotiator, are you?

407
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,926
I was not sent
to negotiate.

408
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:32,930
I was instructed only
to deliver the terms.

409
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,014
I see.

410
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,682
Well, then, I want to talk

411
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:37,726
to someone
who<i> can</i> negotiate.

412
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,020
I want to speak
with your First.

413
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,981
There is no First.

414
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,358
I take it there's
no Second either.

415
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:45,901
I command the unit.

416
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,153
Under the Vorta.

417
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:53,491
It must be hard...

418
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:57,704
for a soldier
to take orders from a Vorta.

419
00:24:57,704 --> 00:25:00,291
The Vorta command the Jem'Hadar.

420
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:02,626
That is the order of things.

421
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:05,754
Obedience brings victory.

422
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:09,467
I was on a mission
with the Jem'Hadar once--

423
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:10,884
before the war, of course.

424
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:15,181
Oh, they were good,
tough, professional.

425
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:18,225
It was an honor
to serve with them.

426
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:23,605
But their Vorta, he...

427
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,441
was something different--

428
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:28,068
manipulative

429
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,279
treacherous...

430
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:32,031
trusted by neither side.

431
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:33,407
In the end...

432
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,077
he was killed...

433
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,079
by the Jem'Hadar First.

434
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:43,625
Surprised?

435
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:47,921
Such things have
been known to happen

436
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,257
but they are rare,
and only occur

437
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:52,926
in units that have
lost discipline.

438
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,970
Oh, you mean like a unit

439
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:58,307
marooned on the shores
of a deserted planet.

440
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,228
The Vorta has instructed me
to give you his assurance

441
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:04,813
that neither you nor
your doctor will be harmed

442
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,482
and you will both
be free to leave

443
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:07,816
at the end of your meeting.

444
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,443
What is your response?

445
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:13,197
The word of a Vorta carries
very little weight with me.

446
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,409
Can I have<i> your</i> assurance

447
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:18,911
that we'll be free
to go, Remata'Klan?

448
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:21,997
I have been ordered
to let you go free

449
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,290
after your meeting.

450
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:28,295
You can be assured that
I will obey that order.

451
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:34,260
Very well.

452
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:39,597
We'll make the trade
in one hour.

453
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:41,559
Agreed.

454
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,783
Sounded like you
were actually

455
00:26:57,783 --> 00:27:00,494
getting through to him
for a minute there.

456
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:02,079
You can't break through

457
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:05,332
all that Dominion
conditioning

458
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:07,460
in just one conversation.

459
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:12,131
Do you really think you can
turn him against his Vorta?

460
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,507
I don't know.

461
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:19,263
But there were at least
seven Jem'Hadar soldiers

462
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:21,890
up on that ridge
this morning--

463
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,893
say at least two more
at their base camp

464
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:28,105
guarding their prisoners
and their Vorta.

465
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:31,400
Without Nog and Mr. Garak
on our side

466
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,987
that gives them almost
a two-to-one advantage.

467
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:38,031
I think I'd like
to check out now.

468
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,326
So would I, old man.

469
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,629
You may go.

470
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:03,474
Now, don't get too
far ahead, Nog.

471
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:05,683
We don't want
to startle anyone.

472
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:09,980
Ah, good afternoon,
Captain, Doctor.

473
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,773
SISKO:
Are you two all right?

474
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,150
GARAK:
Perfect.
How are you?

475
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,234
BASHIR:
Felt better.

476
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,202
Anything yet?

477
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:24,953
Not yet.

478
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,873
There are two Vedeks inside,
but we've seen no indication

479
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:29,583
they intend
to leave the shrine.

480
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:30,584
What about Yassim?

481
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:31,627
She hasn't shown up.

482
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:32,919
Let's hope she doesn't.

483
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,463
The last thing
I want to do

484
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:36,173
is start arresting
Bajoran civilians

485
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:38,384
here on the Promenade.

486
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:39,926
Don't think there's
going to be any story

487
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,011
here for you
today, Jake.

488
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:42,179
You sure?

489
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:43,930
I got a message
from Vedek Yassim

490
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,684
saying the protest was
starting at exactly 1400.

491
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:48,602
It certainly doesn't
look like it.

492
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:49,895
MAN:
What's she doing?!

493
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:51,522
Evil must be opposed.

494
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:23,970
(<i> moans</i> )

495
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:28,850
Captain Sisko...

496
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,977
my name is Keevan.

497
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:33,230
We have a lot to talk about.

498
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,565
BASHIR:
Not for a while

499
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:36,024
you don't.

500
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,318
He needs immediate surgery.

501
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:39,695
Now?

502
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:41,572
I don't think I have any choice.

503
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,409
I am a doctor.

504
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:47,703
I'm not going
to harm him.

505
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:48,954
(<i> Keevan sighs</i> )

506
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:51,123
They're not here
to protect me.

507
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,750
They've just never seen

508
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,586
what the inside
of a Vorta looks like.

509
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,891
COMPUTER:
The time is 0500 hours.

510
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:29,119
Thank you, Mavek.

511
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,953
How was the show?

512
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:14,707
Informative.

513
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:17,793
(<i> sighs heavily</i> )

514
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:19,419
Ah, I am alive.

515
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,297
No self-diagnosis, please.

516
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,383
I'm the doctor here.

517
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:27,594
Your internal
hemorrhaging
has stopped.

518
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:30,305
Your free-collagen levels
are dropping.

519
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:33,684
Tissue growth factors
have stabilized nicely

520
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:36,936
and there's a 50 percent rise
in cell oxygenation.

521
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:39,189
You...<i> are</i> alive.

522
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:41,358
(<i> moans</i> )

523
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:42,526
Careful.

524
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:45,237
Your insides are
being held together

525
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:49,032
by cellular micro-sutures,
and... a lot of hope.

526
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,579
Leave us.

527
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:55,955
And take your men
with you.

528
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:12,556
May I have that case, please?

529
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,897
(<i> labored breathing</i> )

530
00:32:19,897 --> 00:32:23,149
There are ten Jem'Hadar soldiers
on this planet, Captain...

531
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:29,448
and that is
the only vial

532
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:31,825
of ketracel-white we have left.

533
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:35,995
When it's gone, my hold
over them will be broken

534
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,581
and they'll become
nothing more

535
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:40,542
than senseless,
violent animals.

536
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:43,879
They'll kill
everyone they can...

537
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:48,174
me, you, the rest of your men...

538
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,678
and finally turn on each other.

539
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:54,347
Why are you
telling us this?

540
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:57,601
I'm ordering the Jem'Hadar
to attack your base camp

541
00:32:57,601 --> 00:32:59,478
in the morning.

542
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,314
But I will
provide you

543
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,817
with their precise plan
of attack.

544
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:07,694
You should be able
to kill them all.

545
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:09,696
They're your own men.

546
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,740
Yes.

547
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,493
You still haven't answered
my question.

548
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,871
Why are you doing this?

549
00:33:19,957 --> 00:33:23,418
That... that's
a communications system.

550
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,129
It needs repair

551
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,965
but I'm willing to bet
that you've brought

552
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:30,383
one of those
famed Starfleet engineers

553
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:32,385
who can turn rocks
into replicators.

554
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,805
He should have
a lot more success

555
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:38,767
at repairing it than a Jem'Hadar
suffering from withdrawal.

556
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,769
Once you've
taken care

557
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,522
of the Jem'Hadar...

558
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:46,608
I'll give you the com system

559
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:48,944
and surrender to you...

560
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:50,904
as a prisoner of war.

561
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:54,533
And you spend the war
resting comfortably

562
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:56,493
as a Starfleet POW

563
00:33:56,493 --> 00:34:00,121
while your men lie
rotting on this planet.

564
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:03,000
I see we understand each other.

565
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,672
I'm going to order the Jem'Hadar

566
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:10,716
to attack your
position tomorrow

567
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:14,344
regardless of whether
you agree to my terms or not.

568
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:17,305
So you can either kill them...

569
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:18,849
or they'll kill you.

570
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:21,727
Either way...

571
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:25,146
they're coming.

572
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,487
And when they've reached
this point

573
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:35,365
we'll have them in a crossfire.

574
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:36,950
They won't have a chance.

575
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,326
Now, that<i> is</i> the point.

576
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,787
In case you've forgotten,
we're in a war.

577
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:43,164
There<i> are</i> 
rules, Garak

578
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,416
even in war.

579
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,752
Correction--
humans have rules in war.

580
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:48,712
Rules that tend to make victory

581
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:51,130
a little harder to achieve,
in my opinion.

582
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,633
So we just... shoot them down?

583
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:54,968
They wouldn't

584
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:56,636
hesitate
if the situation was reversed.

585
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,346
NOG:
But we're not
the Jem'Hadar.

586
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,305
It is our duty to--

587
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:00,807
This isn't a vote!

588
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:07,230
The decision's mine.

589
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,775
And Mr. Garak is right--
we are at war.

590
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:11,693
Given the choice
between us and them

591
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,904
there<i> is</i> no choice.

592
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,448
Let's move out.

593
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:23,997
I'd say good luck

594
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:26,666
but I... I don't think
you're going to need it.

595
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,543
Say it anyway,
old man.

596
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:31,922
I'm still hoping there's
another way out of this.

597
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:33,256
In that case...

598
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,383
good luck, Benjamin.

599
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,953
Damar has been trying
to contact you

600
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:04,704
for the past five hours.

601
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:13,212
I keep going over it
and over it in my mind.

602
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:15,298
And I can't
believe that...

603
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,844
that I stood there...

604
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:22,639
ready to use force
to stop a protest

605
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:23,932
against the Dominion.

606
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,266
Me.

607
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:28,895
When I was in the
resistance, I despised

608
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,856
people like me.

609
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:35,276
I'm a collaborator, Odo.

610
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,569
That's not true.

611
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,738
You're doing exactly
what Captain Sisko

612
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,949
wanted you and the rest
of Bajor to do--

613
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:43,660
remain neutral and stay
out of the fighting.

614
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,620
We used to have a saying
in the resistance:

615
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,956
If you're not fighting them,
you're helping them.

616
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:50,000
Half the Alpha
Quadrant is out there

617
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,501
right now, fighting
for my freedom

618
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:52,878
but not me.

619
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:55,630
What am I doing?

620
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,757
Eating a full meal
every day

621
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:59,551
sleeping in a soft bed--

622
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,011
even write reports

623
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:03,304
for the murderers
who run this station.

624
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,060
These are difficult
times for everyone.

625
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,103
Do you think
it's easy for me

626
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:12,772
to sit down with Dukat
and Weyoun every day

627
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,608
while they plot the destruction
of the Federation?

628
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:18,361
Odo...

629
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,446
I'm not pointing
a finger at you.

630
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:22,532
I'm the one who told you

631
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:25,202
to get more involved
in the first place.

632
00:37:25,202 --> 00:37:27,579
No, this is about me.

633
00:37:29,206 --> 00:37:32,042
This is about being able
to get up in the morning

634
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:34,753
and look in the mirror
and not feel nauseated

635
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:37,005
by what I see.

636
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:40,926
Yassim was right.

637
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:46,305
I have to do something.

638
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,474
I have to start
to fight back.

639
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:50,852
That would be a mistake.

640
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,771
Active resistance will
trigger a crackdown--

641
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,231
Odo...

642
00:37:54,231 --> 00:37:58,484
I don't want to end up
fighting you, too...

643
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,445
but if I have to...

644
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,447
I will.

645
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:07,035
(<i> sighs</i> )

646
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:08,453
All right.

647
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:11,831
But let's find
a more discreet place

648
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,833
to plan the new resistance.

649
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,593
SISKO:
Remata'Klan!

650
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:06,970
I want to talk!

651
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,224
Agreed!

652
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,068
Hold this position.

653
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,153
Do not fire

654
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:24,196
unless they do.

655
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:25,322
Understood.

656
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,846
There's no way
out of this canyon

657
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:52,849
and we have phasers locked
on every one of you.

658
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,562
It appears you have
a decisive advantage.

659
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,981
To fight a battle
under these circumstances

660
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:01,149
would serve no purpose.

661
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,817
I'm prepared to offer terms.

662
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,527
Hear me out!

663
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,654
I know you need
more ketracel-white.

664
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:09,115
My doctor can
sedate your men

665
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,492
and keep them alive
until we're rescued.

666
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:14,287
After that, we can put you
in medical stasis

667
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:16,206
until we secure
a new supply.

668
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:19,584
The Vorta did not give me
the option to surrender.

669
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:20,835
Keevan's betrayed you!

670
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:27,800
He gave us your entire plan
of attack last night.

671
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:38,353
It was obvious that approaching
your position from this canyon

672
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:40,813
was a deliberate
tactical error on his part.

673
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,315
You knew?

674
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:44,317
I suspected.

675
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:46,861
Despite what Keevan may think

676
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:50,323
the Jem'Hadar are often
one step ahead of the Vorta.

677
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:53,034
You can still stay
one step ahead.

678
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:53,993
Surrender.

679
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:56,162
I have my orders.

680
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,496
Keevan doesn't deserve

681
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:59,498
the unwavering loyalty
you're giving him.

682
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:03,169
He does not have to earn
my loyalty, Captain.

683
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:06,965
He has had it from the moment
I was conceived.

684
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:08,883
I am a Jem'Hadar.

685
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,885
He is a Vorta.

686
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,221
It is the order of things.

687
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:18,268
Do you really want
to give up your life

688
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:20,728
for the order of things?

689
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:23,231
It is not my life
to give up, Captain.

690
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,775
And it never was.

691
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:48,923
What'd he say?

692
00:41:50,175 --> 00:41:52,010
All the wrong things.

693
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:57,349
Our death is glory
to the Founders.

694
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,293
O'BRIEN:
Captain?

695
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:25,562
You know, Captain

696
00:43:25,562 --> 00:43:28,440
if I had had just
two more vials

697
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,442
of white...

698
00:43:30,442 --> 00:43:32,444
you never would've had a chance.

699
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:34,529
Chief!

700
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:35,947
Get this...

701
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,325
Take him back to base camp

702
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:42,161
then get to work
on that com system.

703
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:44,456
Aye, sir.

704
00:43:44,456 --> 00:43:46,291
Lieutenant Neeley!

705
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:47,917
Sir?

706
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:49,627
Form a burial detail.

707
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,004
Aye, sir.
