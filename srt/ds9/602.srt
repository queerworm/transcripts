1
00:00:02,197 --> 00:00:04,065
Captain's Log, supplemental.

2
00:00:04,102 --> 00:00:06,369
O'Brien needed three days
to restore main power

3
00:00:06,407 --> 00:00:08,104
to our commandeered
Dominion ship

4
00:00:08,144 --> 00:00:10,479
but he's not going to get them.

5
00:00:10,517 --> 00:00:12,613
Sensors have detected
two Jem'Hadar fighters

6
00:00:12,656 --> 00:00:14,559
heading our way,
and without main power

7
00:00:14,593 --> 00:00:17,965
our chances of survival
are slim to none.

8
00:00:19,104 --> 00:00:21,702
Try it now.

9
00:00:21,743 --> 00:00:23,007
Reroute the damned gyrodyne

10
00:00:23,047 --> 00:00:24,676
through the damned
thruster array.

11
00:00:24,718 --> 00:00:25,686
Got it.

12
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,554
Mr. Garak, where are
those ships now?

13
00:00:27,591 --> 00:00:32,763
Bearing 310 mark 215,
still closing.

14
00:00:32,804 --> 00:00:34,968
Nog, did you reroute
that damned gyrodyne?

15
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:36,946
I'm trying, but
the damned thruster array

16
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,005
won't take the input.

17
00:00:38,049 --> 00:00:39,746
Try the lateral
impulse thrusters.

18
00:00:39,787 --> 00:00:40,812
And watch your mouth.

19
00:00:40,856 --> 00:00:42,621
Access the auxiliary core

20
00:00:42,661 --> 00:00:44,187
through the starboard
engineering console.

21
00:00:44,231 --> 00:00:45,894
I've already tried that.

22
00:00:45,935 --> 00:00:48,065
Still no power
to weapons or shields.

23
00:00:48,107 --> 00:00:50,271
Dax, there's
a dark matter nebula

24
00:00:50,345 --> 00:00:51,370
60 degrees above the bow.

25
00:00:51,415 --> 00:00:52,383
Can we reach it?

26
00:00:52,417 --> 00:00:54,080
Yes, but that nebula's
never been charted.

27
00:00:54,122 --> 00:00:55,386
We don't know what's in there.

28
00:00:55,424 --> 00:00:58,522
The Jem'Hadar ships
are entering weapons range.

29
00:01:02,942 --> 00:01:03,875
Dax!

30
00:01:03,911 --> 00:01:05,244
Get us into the nebula.

31
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:06,271
Full impulse!

32
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:20,749
Sisko to Bashir,
medical emergency.

33
00:01:21,821 --> 00:01:23,313
Helm control's gone.

34
00:01:36,523 --> 00:01:37,856
Okay, all right.

35
00:01:37,893 --> 00:01:41,334
You'll be feeling
better any second now.

36
00:01:43,907 --> 00:01:45,878
She's got a puncture
of the right abdominal cavity.

37
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,111
It looks as thought the symbiont
may have been injured.

38
00:01:50,924 --> 00:01:53,692
Sensors are gone,
impulse engines off-line.

39
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:55,223
In fact, everything's off-line.

40
00:01:55,268 --> 00:01:57,637
Emergency power's
holding for now.

41
00:01:57,674 --> 00:01:59,337
Mr. Garak, take a look outside.

42
00:01:59,378 --> 00:02:00,346
Just a moment.

43
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,542
Chief, what happened?

44
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:02,551
I don't know.

45
00:02:02,585 --> 00:02:03,986
We must have been hit
by some kind

46
00:02:04,022 --> 00:02:05,081
of gravitational spike in the...

47
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,093
Oh, no!

48
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:07,026
Mr. Garak?

49
00:02:07,063 --> 00:02:09,159
Hold on!

50
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:19,095
We have established
a defense perimeter

51
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:20,699
around the entrance
to the cavern.

52
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,881
I have sent two patrols
to reconnoiter the shoreline

53
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,287
in both directions.

54
00:04:27,961 --> 00:04:30,900
The Vorta's condition
has worsened.

55
00:04:30,935 --> 00:04:32,302
He will die soon.

56
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:34,138
What about the First
and the Second?

57
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,408
I vaporized their bodies myself

58
00:04:36,515 --> 00:04:38,041
and redistributed
their equipment

59
00:04:38,085 --> 00:04:39,179
to the rest of the men.

60
00:04:39,221 --> 00:04:41,522
You are now the First.

61
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,124
No. I questioned
the Vorta's orders.

62
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,692
He will not forget that.

63
00:04:45,736 --> 00:04:49,769
As long as he lives,
I will remain Third.

64
00:04:49,813 --> 00:04:51,784
You were right to question him.

65
00:04:51,818 --> 00:04:54,119
If he had not ordered us
into the nebula two days ago

66
00:04:54,156 --> 00:04:55,284
we would not have crashed.

67
00:04:55,326 --> 00:04:57,820
It was not my place.

68
00:04:57,865 --> 00:05:01,772
Remember,
obedience brings victory.

69
00:05:03,412 --> 00:05:05,815
And victory is life.

70
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:07,321
Until we reestablish
communications

71
00:05:07,355 --> 00:05:09,086
we will hold this world
for the Dominion.

72
00:05:09,126 --> 00:05:11,620
And if we cannot
reestablish communications?

73
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:14,264
Then we will hold this world
for the Dominion...

74
00:05:14,305 --> 00:05:16,242
until we die.

75
00:05:46,248 --> 00:05:49,711
Cadet, this is no time

76
00:05:49,757 --> 00:05:51,226
to lie down on the job.

77
00:05:57,074 --> 00:05:58,042
Heave!

78
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,982
One more, now... heave!

79
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:17,082
All right, how is she?

80
00:06:17,122 --> 00:06:19,457
She's stable for now.

81
00:06:19,495 --> 00:06:21,989
Garak! I need a hand.

82
00:06:35,533 --> 00:06:37,002
Oh, no.

83
00:06:37,036 --> 00:06:38,801
What?

84
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:40,572
I don't believe it.

85
00:06:40,678 --> 00:06:41,703
What?

86
00:06:41,748 --> 00:06:44,380
I tore my pants.

87
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:48,487
You... you tore your pants.

88
00:06:51,304 --> 00:06:53,035
Yeah, I tore my pants.

89
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:01,183
I guess...

90
00:07:01,228 --> 00:07:03,495
I guess I'm really
in trouble now, huh?

91
00:07:18,507 --> 00:07:21,571
The time is 0500 hours.

92
00:08:07,492 --> 00:08:08,984
Thank you, Mavek.

93
00:08:14,441 --> 00:08:19,249
This must be
quite gratifying for you

94
00:08:19,353 --> 00:08:23,796
but I've decided not to give you
the pleasure of watching me die

95
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,926
in this foul-smelling cavern.

96
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:29,374
I intend to live.

97
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,073
I understand.

98
00:08:34,155 --> 00:08:36,855
How long until we've
reestablished communications?

99
00:08:36,895 --> 00:08:41,031
Seventh Yak'Talon estimates that
it will take at least ten days

100
00:08:41,071 --> 00:08:43,304
before we can attempt
a low-power test.

101
00:08:43,411 --> 00:08:45,473
Ten days.

102
00:08:49,558 --> 00:08:51,688
It is time for the white.

103
00:09:20,032 --> 00:09:22,333
Third Remata'Klan...

104
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:25,137
can you vouch
for the loyalty of your men?

105
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:30,218
We pledge our loyalty
to the Founders

106
00:09:30,256 --> 00:09:31,953
from now until death.

107
00:09:33,464 --> 00:09:37,839
Then receive this reward
from the Founders.

108
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,282
May it keep you strong.

109
00:09:43,588 --> 00:09:44,989
Only one?

110
00:09:45,025 --> 00:09:47,657
Keep your place.

111
00:09:49,803 --> 00:09:53,676
This case of white must last
until we're rescued...

112
00:09:53,712 --> 00:09:55,045
at least ten days

113
00:09:55,082 --> 00:09:56,551
possibly more.

114
00:09:56,586 --> 00:09:59,218
I will ration the supply.

115
00:10:00,696 --> 00:10:02,530
Don't worry.

116
00:10:02,566 --> 00:10:04,935
I am the Vorta.

117
00:10:04,973 --> 00:10:08,037
I will take care of you all.

118
00:10:19,006 --> 00:10:22,070
Lucky for you,
it ripped on the seam.

119
00:10:22,114 --> 00:10:23,708
Can you fix it?

120
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:24,879
Unlucky for you

121
00:10:24,921 --> 00:10:26,949
my sewing kit went
down with the ship.

122
00:10:26,992 --> 00:10:28,826
Maybe someone could go get it.

123
00:10:28,863 --> 00:10:31,461
The ship's only about 500
meters below the surface.

124
00:10:31,503 --> 00:10:33,371
How long can you hold
your breath, Cadet?

125
00:10:33,408 --> 00:10:38,786
Madame, your pants are ready.

126
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,850
Your boots and vest will
take a little longer.

127
00:10:41,894 --> 00:10:42,862
While you wait

128
00:10:42,897 --> 00:10:44,868
I might suggest that you browse

129
00:10:44,902 --> 00:10:46,873
through the hotel's gift shop.

130
00:10:46,906 --> 00:10:49,811
No, thank you

131
00:10:49,847 --> 00:10:53,880
but I would like
to lodge a complaint.

132
00:10:53,923 --> 00:10:54,948
Hmm?

133
00:10:54,993 --> 00:10:57,260
This bed is as hard as a rock.

134
00:10:57,298 --> 00:11:00,294
I will make note of that.

135
00:11:00,338 --> 00:11:01,830
What's the prognosis?

136
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:02,843
Guarded, but good.

137
00:11:02,878 --> 00:11:04,074
The bleeding's stopped

138
00:11:04,114 --> 00:11:06,517
and I've repaired all
the internal injuries.

139
00:11:06,587 --> 00:11:10,392
The damage to the symbiont
is a little harder to diagnose.

140
00:11:10,429 --> 00:11:11,419
Given enough rest

141
00:11:11,466 --> 00:11:13,960
I think they'll both
make a full recovery.

142
00:11:14,004 --> 00:11:18,880
In other words, I'm going to be
staring at this cave ceiling

143
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,681
for the rest of my stay.

144
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:24,127
Lucky for you, they have
24-hour room service.

145
00:11:28,038 --> 00:11:32,709
I will get you out of here,
old man, I promise.

146
00:11:32,749 --> 00:11:35,985
I'm going to hold you
to that one, Benjamin.

147
00:11:54,535 --> 00:11:55,868
What are you doing?

148
00:11:55,905 --> 00:11:57,340
Following orders.

149
00:11:57,375 --> 00:12:00,212
Captain told us to scan the area
for fresh water and vegetation...

150
00:12:00,249 --> 00:12:02,584
You know precisely what I mean.

151
00:12:02,654 --> 00:12:04,146
You're deliberately
staying behind me

152
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:05,820
and I want to know why.

153
00:12:07,065 --> 00:12:08,466
Does this have anything to do

154
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:11,474
with that unfortunate business
between you and me last year?

155
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:13,605
You tied me up
and threatened to kill me.

156
00:12:13,681 --> 00:12:15,879
There were extenuating
circumstances.

157
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,116
It happened.

158
00:12:17,156 --> 00:12:21,189
So you can either stay in front
of me or walk beside me

159
00:12:21,232 --> 00:12:23,203
but I won't turn my back
on you again.

160
00:12:24,407 --> 00:12:28,349
Cadet, there may be
hope for you yet.

161
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:33,527
What is it?

162
00:12:33,562 --> 00:12:34,552
I'm not sure, but...

163
00:12:38,908 --> 00:12:41,506
Now I'm sure.

164
00:12:47,065 --> 00:12:49,697
How many others
are there in your unit?

165
00:12:49,738 --> 00:12:50,934
Nog...

166
00:12:50,975 --> 00:12:54,575
Cadet Third Class,
serial number C X-937...

167
00:12:54,617 --> 00:12:55,813
Shut up.

168
00:12:57,324 --> 00:12:59,488
As I tried to explain
to your men

169
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,796
my name is Kamar,
and I'm a member

170
00:13:01,834 --> 00:13:04,101
of the Cardassian
Intelligence Bureau...

171
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:06,576
what used to be called
the Obsidian Order.

172
00:13:06,613 --> 00:13:09,016
A week ago, as I was
performing my duties

173
00:13:09,051 --> 00:13:11,488
in the glorious service
of the Founders

174
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:13,689
I was captured
by the USS <i>Centaur.</i>

175
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:14,960
I was held aboard

176
00:13:14,999 --> 00:13:16,628
one of their shuttles
when we were forced...

177
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,903
Excuse me, Mr. Kamar...

178
00:13:18,942 --> 00:13:21,972
if that's really your name...

179
00:13:22,016 --> 00:13:27,894
but if you're one of our allies,
why were you wearing this?

180
00:13:29,534 --> 00:13:31,060
Ah.

181
00:13:31,104 --> 00:13:35,410
I was hoping you weren't going
to ask me about that.

182
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:38,546
I only have one
further question for you.

183
00:13:40,427 --> 00:13:42,762
Is there a doctor in your unit?

184
00:13:45,372 --> 00:13:46,340
Yes.

185
00:13:46,407 --> 00:13:48,036
Garak!

186
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,052
Don't be too hard on him,
young man.

187
00:13:51,086 --> 00:13:53,182
He just saved your life.

188
00:13:56,098 --> 00:13:58,194
Take them to a secure area.

189
00:14:01,076 --> 00:14:02,602
Third...

190
00:14:04,918 --> 00:14:06,821
I have a mission for you.

191
00:14:06,857 --> 00:14:10,093
I want you to find
the Starfleet unit

192
00:14:10,132 --> 00:14:13,698
but do not engage them.

193
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,643
Locate them...

194
00:14:15,678 --> 00:14:19,780
assess their strength
and then report back to me.

195
00:14:19,821 --> 00:14:21,621
I understand.

196
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:24,655
No, you don't.

197
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,363
But that's all right.

198
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:29,307
It's not important
that you understand...

199
00:14:29,343 --> 00:14:33,148
only that you carry out
my instructions precisely.

200
00:14:33,187 --> 00:14:35,716
Obedience brings victory.

201
00:14:36,995 --> 00:14:39,125
Yes...

202
00:14:39,167 --> 00:14:41,035
yes, it does.

203
00:14:42,876 --> 00:14:44,175
Go.

204
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,201
I understand
that a decision's been made

205
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,270
to send 4,000 Dominion
facilitators down to Bajor.

206
00:14:58,313 --> 00:15:00,181
Would you care to elaborate?

207
00:15:00,218 --> 00:15:02,918
It's only 400,
and how did you hear about that?

208
00:15:02,957 --> 00:15:06,193
The official announcement
isn't scheduled until tomorrow.

209
00:15:06,232 --> 00:15:07,326
I hear things.

210
00:15:07,369 --> 00:15:08,668
So could you elaborate?

211
00:15:08,704 --> 00:15:10,834
My readers want to know
what's going on.

212
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,402
You don't have any readers.

213
00:15:12,481 --> 00:15:13,882
Weyoun is still blocking

214
00:15:13,918 --> 00:15:16,516
the transmission
of your stories.

215
00:15:16,557 --> 00:15:18,721
For now, but what
if he changes his mind?

216
00:15:18,762 --> 00:15:20,129
Don't you want to explain

217
00:15:20,165 --> 00:15:23,161
what's going on here
to the outside world?

218
00:15:25,077 --> 00:15:28,848
Ever since the war started,
Bajor's been completely cut off

219
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:30,288
from all outside trade.

220
00:15:30,324 --> 00:15:31,953
We've had nowhere to turn

221
00:15:31,994 --> 00:15:36,027
for things like spare parts
or medical supplies, nowhere...

222
00:15:36,071 --> 00:15:38,099
except the Dominion.

223
00:15:38,142 --> 00:15:42,312
So a group of facilitators is
going to Bajor for a few months

224
00:15:42,352 --> 00:15:44,380
to provide
some technical assistance.

225
00:15:44,423 --> 00:15:46,987
How do you respond to critics
like Vedek Yassim

226
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:50,698
who say that by welcoming
a group of Vorta to Bajor

227
00:15:50,739 --> 00:15:53,735
you're taking the first step
towards Dominion occupation?

228
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:55,009
I have been assured

229
00:15:55,049 --> 00:15:57,247
that the facilitators
will be unarmed

230
00:15:57,288 --> 00:16:00,159
and unaccompanied
by any Jem'Hadar soldiers.

231
00:16:01,464 --> 00:16:03,731
Odo, do you have any concerns

232
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:07,974
that by joining the Ruling
Council here on the station

233
00:16:08,013 --> 00:16:10,577
you're validating
the occupation?

234
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,388
The Dominion doesn't need
my validation.

235
00:16:13,427 --> 00:16:16,161
They're here,
and they're not leaving...

236
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,262
not without a fight, at least.

237
00:16:18,305 --> 00:16:19,467
Are you finished?

238
00:16:19,507 --> 00:16:21,136
Almost, almost.

239
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:24,779
Will either of you be attending
the demonstration tomorrow?

240
00:16:26,191 --> 00:16:27,524
The what?

241
00:16:27,594 --> 00:16:30,533
Vedek Yassim has organized
a demonstration

242
00:16:30,634 --> 00:16:33,128
on the Promenade
tomorrow afternoon

243
00:16:33,173 --> 00:16:36,807
to protest the Dominion
occupation of the station.

244
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:39,652
That's all the excuse
Dukat will need

245
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:42,059
to order
a new security crackdown.

246
00:16:42,095 --> 00:16:43,530
I'll talk to Yassim.

247
00:16:43,565 --> 00:16:47,165
So, you're going to abolish
the right to protest

248
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:48,506
here on the station?

249
00:16:49,546 --> 00:16:50,879
Hey, I'm not trying

250
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:53,514
to accuse you personally
of anything.

251
00:16:53,556 --> 00:16:55,823
I'm just asking questions.

252
00:16:55,861 --> 00:16:58,230
I think this interview
is over.

253
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:00,171
I couldn't agree more.

254
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,185
Wrong question, Jake.

255
00:17:09,394 --> 00:17:11,490
I might be able to hard-wire

256
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:14,026
one of our combadges
into this sensor array.

257
00:17:14,072 --> 00:17:15,302
That would give us

258
00:17:15,341 --> 00:17:17,437
a crude transmitter
but no power source.

259
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,781
What about draining
one of our phasers?

260
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:22,188
I thought about that,
but I need a converter

261
00:17:22,225 --> 00:17:25,461
to bridge the two power cells,
and I can't build a converter

262
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,060
without an ion-exchange
matrix.

263
00:17:27,103 --> 00:17:28,937
Captain, I think
we may have a problem.

264
00:17:28,975 --> 00:17:30,740
Garak and Nog
haven't reported in yet

265
00:17:30,778 --> 00:17:32,475
and they're not
answering my hails.

266
00:18:00,309 --> 00:18:04,581
Captain, there's a group
of life-forms up in the cliffs.

267
00:18:04,653 --> 00:18:06,920
Range 75 meters,
elevation 30 meters.

268
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:08,588
That's where I'd be.

269
00:18:08,696 --> 00:18:10,826
Are they Jem'Hadar?

270
00:18:10,868 --> 00:18:12,599
I think so.

271
00:18:12,639 --> 00:18:14,735
Well, let's not
make it easy for them.

272
00:18:14,778 --> 00:18:18,811
Tell the Chief to head toward
that large outcropping of rocks

273
00:18:18,854 --> 00:18:20,118
at ten o'clock.

274
00:18:20,157 --> 00:18:21,285
Walk, don't run.

275
00:18:24,835 --> 00:18:26,498
Chief...

276
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:29,137
we need to make
for those rocks up ahead.

277
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,238
I can't take it!

278
00:19:12,482 --> 00:19:13,815
Terminate fire!

279
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:14,877
Terminate!

280
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:18,796
You have been ordered
to stop firing!

281
00:19:22,006 --> 00:19:23,669
Your orders were clear.

282
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:26,078
You were not
to engage the enemy.

283
00:19:26,115 --> 00:19:27,311
Who fired first?

284
00:19:27,351 --> 00:19:28,843
I did.

285
00:19:28,888 --> 00:19:30,517
You are reduced to Sixth.

286
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:31,721
You will shroud

287
00:19:31,828 --> 00:19:33,696
and return to base camp.

288
00:19:33,733 --> 00:19:36,501
I am no longer able
to shroud myself.

289
00:19:43,457 --> 00:19:44,756
You, you.

290
00:19:44,859 --> 00:19:47,457
Provide suppression fire
as we withdraw.

291
00:19:47,499 --> 00:19:48,489
Understood.

292
00:19:48,536 --> 00:19:50,564
Withdraw!

293
00:19:53,681 --> 00:19:55,618
Remata'Klan

294
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,213
I regret my disobedience.

295
00:20:04,707 --> 00:20:06,006
Are they pulling out?

296
00:20:06,044 --> 00:20:07,103
Looks that way.

297
00:20:07,147 --> 00:20:08,776
Why aren't they camouflaged?

298
00:20:08,817 --> 00:20:10,411
That's a good question.

299
00:20:10,454 --> 00:20:13,860
Let's hope the answer is
something in our favor.

300
00:20:16,001 --> 00:20:17,095
Cease fire!

301
00:20:18,608 --> 00:20:21,206
Why were my orders disobeyed?

302
00:20:21,247 --> 00:20:24,049
Lack of white produces
anxiety among us.

303
00:20:24,087 --> 00:20:25,386
One man

304
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,258
could not restrain himself
when he saw the enemy.

305
00:20:27,295 --> 00:20:28,263
Which man?

306
00:20:28,297 --> 00:20:30,097
I have dealt with the matter.

307
00:20:30,135 --> 00:20:31,866
I asked for his name!

308
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,274
He is my responsibility.

309
00:20:34,312 --> 00:20:35,576
His name!

310
00:20:39,591 --> 00:20:44,125
I may not be First,
but I am the unit leader.

311
00:20:44,168 --> 00:20:46,571
You may discipline me.

312
00:20:46,608 --> 00:20:49,376
But only I discipline the men.

313
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,613
That is the order of things.

314
00:20:54,694 --> 00:20:57,258
Very well.

315
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,498
I'll leave him to you.

316
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:01,868
Dismissed.

317
00:21:05,586 --> 00:21:08,286
You've done well, Third.

318
00:21:08,326 --> 00:21:11,231
You may yet become First.

319
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:13,961
Now...

320
00:21:16,212 --> 00:21:19,049
I have a new task for you.

321
00:21:23,229 --> 00:21:25,632
The Dominion is evil

322
00:21:25,668 --> 00:21:29,404
and the Prophets tell us
that evil must be opposed.

323
00:21:29,444 --> 00:21:31,677
You'll get no argument
from me, Vedek

324
00:21:31,716 --> 00:21:35,589
but protests and demonstrations
aren't going to change anything.

325
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:38,564
They're just going to cause
trouble for everyone.

326
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:41,401
Then what would you have us do
to oppose the Dominion?

327
00:21:41,439 --> 00:21:42,772
I...

328
00:21:44,614 --> 00:21:46,847
I don't think there's anything

329
00:21:46,886 --> 00:21:49,484
you or the other Vedeks
can do right now.

330
00:21:49,525 --> 00:21:51,393
I see.

331
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:53,730
Then as a Bajoran
Liaison Officer

332
00:21:53,769 --> 00:21:56,263
what will you be doing
to fight the Dominion?

333
00:21:56,308 --> 00:21:58,336
Fighting isn't an option.

334
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:03,957
This is different than
the Cardassian occupation.

335
00:22:04,027 --> 00:22:05,496
Is it?

336
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:09,062
The Cardassians are in control
of the station.

337
00:22:09,105 --> 00:22:12,978
Bajoran freedoms are being
curtailed one by one.

338
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:14,986
And soon the first wave

339
00:22:15,053 --> 00:22:18,220
of alien troops will be
landing on our world.

340
00:22:18,261 --> 00:22:21,325
We're talking about
unarmed Vorta facilitators.

341
00:22:21,368 --> 00:22:24,706
They come in, they do their job
and they're gone.

342
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:27,443
Can't you see
what is happening to you?

343
00:22:27,483 --> 00:22:31,585
You're becoming an apologist
for them, a defender of evil.

344
00:22:31,626 --> 00:22:35,568
What will it take
to make you act, Kira?

345
00:22:35,602 --> 00:22:39,043
To stop accepting them
and start fighting back?

346
00:22:39,077 --> 00:22:40,512
Vedek, you...

347
00:22:42,084 --> 00:22:44,317
you just don't understand.

348
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:50,403
You are right.

349
00:22:50,438 --> 00:22:52,067
I don't.

350
00:22:53,311 --> 00:22:55,544
Maybe tomorrow...

351
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,417
we will both understand.

352
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,527
We'll set up
three defensive positions.

353
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,730
You and Ensign Gordon
on the south ridge.

354
00:23:08,772 --> 00:23:10,868
Lieutenant Neeley
near the lava tube.

355
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:13,474
Bashir and I are in the dunes.

356
00:23:14,485 --> 00:23:16,547
I'll stay here
and guard my clothes.

357
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,923
Neeley to Captain Sisko.

358
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,224
Go ahead.

359
00:23:19,263 --> 00:23:22,430
A Jem'Hadar soldier has just
approached my position, sir.

360
00:23:22,471 --> 00:23:25,273
He says he wants
to talk to you... alone.

361
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:45,523
Sir?

362
00:23:53,312 --> 00:23:55,408
I'm Captain Benjamin Sisko.

363
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:56,976
Third Remata'Klan.

364
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:01,019
Two members of your unit
are being held at our base camp.

365
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:04,094
We'll exchange them
for you and your doctor.

366
00:24:04,137 --> 00:24:05,937
Why do you need a doctor?

367
00:24:05,975 --> 00:24:08,242
The Vorta has been
severely wounded.

368
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:09,511
And why me?

369
00:24:09,551 --> 00:24:11,715
The Vorta wishes
to speak with you.

370
00:24:11,756 --> 00:24:13,750
Sounds like he wants to trade

371
00:24:13,793 --> 00:24:16,925
two low-ranking prisoners
for two more valuable ones.

372
00:24:16,968 --> 00:24:19,064
Would you make a deal like that?

373
00:24:19,107 --> 00:24:20,097
No.

374
00:24:20,142 --> 00:24:21,771
Then why should I?

375
00:24:21,813 --> 00:24:23,077
You shouldn't.

376
00:24:23,116 --> 00:24:26,955
You're not a very good
negotiator, are you?

377
00:24:26,992 --> 00:24:29,486
I was not sent to negotiate.

378
00:24:29,531 --> 00:24:33,370
I was instructed only
to deliver the terms.

379
00:24:33,408 --> 00:24:34,604
I see.

380
00:24:34,644 --> 00:24:38,210
Well, then, I want to talk
to someone who can negotiate.

381
00:24:38,253 --> 00:24:40,349
I want to speak with your First.

382
00:24:40,391 --> 00:24:42,362
There is no First.

383
00:24:42,395 --> 00:24:44,696
I take it
there's no Second either.

384
00:24:44,735 --> 00:24:46,204
I command the unit.

385
00:24:46,238 --> 00:24:47,673
Under the Vorta.

386
00:24:51,551 --> 00:24:53,954
It must be hard...

387
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:58,057
for a soldier
to take orders from a Vorta.

388
00:24:58,099 --> 00:25:00,663
The Vorta command the Jem'Hadar.

389
00:25:00,706 --> 00:25:02,973
That is the order of things.

390
00:25:03,011 --> 00:25:05,107
Obedience brings victory.

391
00:25:06,186 --> 00:25:09,820
I was on a mission
with the Jem'Hadar once...

392
00:25:09,862 --> 00:25:12,129
before the war, of course.

393
00:25:12,167 --> 00:25:15,573
Oh, they were good,
tough, professional.

394
00:25:15,609 --> 00:25:18,776
It was an honor
to serve with them.

395
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:24,160
But their Vorta, he...

396
00:25:24,196 --> 00:25:25,722
was something different...

397
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:28,465
manipulative

398
00:25:28,506 --> 00:25:30,636
treacherous...

399
00:25:30,678 --> 00:25:32,443
trusted by neither side.

400
00:25:32,482 --> 00:25:33,974
In the end...

401
00:25:35,355 --> 00:25:37,485
he was killed...

402
00:25:37,528 --> 00:25:39,465
by the Jem'Hadar First.

403
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:44,203
Surprised?

404
00:25:45,847 --> 00:25:48,445
Such things have
been known to happen

405
00:25:48,487 --> 00:25:50,788
but they are rare,
and only occur

406
00:25:50,826 --> 00:25:53,320
in units that have
lost discipline.

407
00:25:53,366 --> 00:25:55,303
Oh, you mean like a unit

408
00:25:55,337 --> 00:25:58,903
marooned on the shores
of a deserted planet.

409
00:26:00,516 --> 00:26:02,612
The Vorta has instructed me
to give you his assurance

410
00:26:02,655 --> 00:26:05,149
that neither you nor
your doctor will be harmed

411
00:26:05,194 --> 00:26:06,959
and you will both
be free to leave

412
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:08,434
at the end of your meeting.

413
00:26:08,469 --> 00:26:09,870
What is your response?

414
00:26:09,905 --> 00:26:13,812
The word of a Vorta carries
very little weight with me.

415
00:26:15,385 --> 00:26:16,979
Can I have your assurance

416
00:26:17,023 --> 00:26:19,460
that we'll be free to go,
Remata'Klan?

417
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:22,491
I have been ordered
to let you go free

418
00:26:22,535 --> 00:26:23,936
after your meeting.

419
00:26:25,308 --> 00:26:28,942
You can be assured
that I will obey that order.

420
00:26:33,696 --> 00:26:34,926
Very well.

421
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:40,035
We'll make the trade
in one hour.

422
00:26:40,078 --> 00:26:42,208
Agreed.

423
00:26:56,116 --> 00:26:58,178
Sounded like you were actually

424
00:26:58,221 --> 00:27:01,023
getting through to him
for a minute there.

425
00:27:01,061 --> 00:27:05,835
You can't break through
all that Dominion conditioning

426
00:27:05,873 --> 00:27:08,037
in just one conversation.

427
00:27:08,078 --> 00:27:12,680
Do you really think you can
turn him against his Vorta?

428
00:27:12,723 --> 00:27:14,215
I don't know.

429
00:27:16,365 --> 00:27:19,828
But there were at least
seven Jem'Hadar soldiers

430
00:27:19,873 --> 00:27:22,242
up on that ridge this morning...

431
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:25,252
say at least two more
at their base camp

432
00:27:25,286 --> 00:27:28,692
guarding their prisoners
and their Vorta.

433
00:27:28,727 --> 00:27:31,997
Without Nog and Mr. Garak
on our side

434
00:27:32,036 --> 00:27:35,636
that gives them almost
a two-to-one advantage.

435
00:27:35,678 --> 00:27:38,583
I think I'd like
to check out now.

436
00:27:38,618 --> 00:27:41,055
So would I, old man.

437
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:51,244
You may go.

438
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:03,078
Now, don't get too far ahead,
Nog.

439
00:28:03,118 --> 00:28:05,112
We don't want to startle anyone.

440
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:09,529
Ah, good afternoon,
Captain, Doctor.

441
00:28:09,567 --> 00:28:11,264
Are you two all right?

442
00:28:11,305 --> 00:28:12,831
Perfect.
How are you?

443
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:13,865
Felt better.

444
00:28:21,896 --> 00:28:22,864
Anything yet?

445
00:28:22,899 --> 00:28:24,300
Not yet.

446
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:27,366
There are two Vedeks inside,
but we've seen no indication

447
00:28:27,409 --> 00:28:29,072
they intend
to leave the shrine.

448
00:28:29,113 --> 00:28:30,081
What about Yassim?

449
00:28:30,116 --> 00:28:31,175
She hasn't shown up.

450
00:28:31,252 --> 00:28:32,516
Let's hope she doesn't.

451
00:28:32,555 --> 00:28:33,854
The last thing I want to do

452
00:28:33,892 --> 00:28:35,692
is start arresting
Bajoran civilians

453
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:36,892
here on the Promenade.

454
00:28:37,902 --> 00:28:39,633
Don't think there's
going to be any story

455
00:28:39,672 --> 00:28:40,697
here for you today, Jake.

456
00:28:40,742 --> 00:28:41,710
You sure?

457
00:28:41,744 --> 00:28:43,441
I got a message
from Vedek Yassim

458
00:28:43,482 --> 00:28:46,216
saying the protest was
starting at exactly 1400.

459
00:28:46,288 --> 00:28:48,225
It certainly doesn't
look like it.

460
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:49,592
What's she doing?!

461
00:28:49,629 --> 00:28:51,155
Evil must be opposed.

462
00:29:25,582 --> 00:29:28,612
Captain Sisko...

463
00:29:28,657 --> 00:29:30,958
my name is Keevan.

464
00:29:30,995 --> 00:29:33,091
We have a lot to talk about.

465
00:29:33,134 --> 00:29:35,800
Not for a while you don't.

466
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,107
He needs immediate surgery.

467
00:29:38,146 --> 00:29:39,479
Now?

468
00:29:39,516 --> 00:29:41,510
I don't think I have any choice.

469
00:29:43,893 --> 00:29:45,294
I am a doctor.

470
00:29:45,363 --> 00:29:47,459
I'm not going to harm him.

471
00:29:48,838 --> 00:29:50,934
They're not here to protect me.

472
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,570
They've just never seen

473
00:29:52,613 --> 00:29:55,313
what the inside
of a Vorta looks like.

474
00:30:06,814 --> 00:30:09,844
The time is 0500 hours.

475
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:29,095
Thank you, Mavek.

476
00:31:10,133 --> 00:31:12,001
How was the show?

477
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,666
Informative.

478
00:31:17,684 --> 00:31:19,347
Ah, I am alive.

479
00:31:19,388 --> 00:31:22,259
No self-diagnosis, please.

480
00:31:22,296 --> 00:31:24,460
I'm the doctor here.

481
00:31:24,567 --> 00:31:27,404
Your internal hemorrhaging
has stopped.

482
00:31:27,441 --> 00:31:30,380
Your free-collagen levels
are dropping.

483
00:31:30,415 --> 00:31:33,753
Tissue growth factors
have stabilized nicely

484
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:37,060
and there's a 50 percent rise
in cell oxygenation.

485
00:31:37,097 --> 00:31:39,261
You... are alive.

486
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,500
Careful.

487
00:31:42,577 --> 00:31:45,071
Your insides are
being held together

488
00:31:45,116 --> 00:31:49,115
by cellular micro-sutures,
and... a lot of hope.

489
00:31:52,634 --> 00:31:53,624
Leave us.

490
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:56,073
And take your men with you.

491
00:32:09,542 --> 00:32:12,481
May I have that case, please?

492
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,297
There are ten Jem'Hadar soldiers
on this planet, Captain...

493
00:32:26,048 --> 00:32:31,892
and that is the only vial
of ketracel-white we have left.

494
00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:36,201
When it's gone, my hold
over them will be broken

495
00:32:36,239 --> 00:32:40,705
and they'll become nothing more
than senseless, violent animals.

496
00:32:40,749 --> 00:32:43,881
They'll kill
everyone they can...

497
00:32:43,924 --> 00:32:48,367
me, you, the rest of your men...

498
00:32:49,638 --> 00:32:51,700
and finally turn on each other.

499
00:32:51,743 --> 00:32:54,580
Why are you telling us this?

500
00:32:54,617 --> 00:32:57,613
I'm ordering the Jem'Hadar
to attack your base camp

501
00:32:57,657 --> 00:32:59,491
in the morning.

502
00:33:00,697 --> 00:33:02,462
But I will provide you

503
00:33:02,502 --> 00:33:04,905
with their precise plan
of attack.

504
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,812
You should be able
to kill them all.

505
00:33:07,848 --> 00:33:09,785
They're your own men.

506
00:33:09,819 --> 00:33:11,949
Yes.

507
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:14,520
You still haven't answered
my question.

508
00:33:16,335 --> 00:33:18,100
Why are you doing this?

509
00:33:20,144 --> 00:33:23,448
That... that's
a communications system.

510
00:33:24,789 --> 00:33:25,985
It needs repair

511
00:33:26,025 --> 00:33:28,121
but I'm willing to bet
that you've brought

512
00:33:28,163 --> 00:33:30,361
one of those
famed Starfleet engineers

513
00:33:30,402 --> 00:33:32,566
who can turn rocks
into replicators.

514
00:33:32,608 --> 00:33:35,011
He should have
a lot more success

515
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:38,988
at repairing it than a Jem'Hadar
suffering from withdrawal.

516
00:33:39,023 --> 00:33:43,659
Once you've taken care
of the Jem'Hadar...

517
00:33:43,734 --> 00:33:46,673
I'll give you the com system

518
00:33:46,707 --> 00:33:49,076
and surrender to you...

519
00:33:49,114 --> 00:33:51,108
as a prisoner of war.

520
00:33:51,152 --> 00:33:54,649
And you spend the war
resting comfortably

521
00:33:54,694 --> 00:33:56,528
as a Starfleet POW

522
00:33:56,564 --> 00:34:00,198
while your men lie
rotting on this planet.

523
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,270
I see we understand each other.

524
00:34:06,422 --> 00:34:10,762
I'm going to order the Jem'Hadar
to attack your position tomorrow

525
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:14,296
regardless of whether
you agree to my terms or not.

526
00:34:14,341 --> 00:34:17,508
So you can either kill them...

527
00:34:17,549 --> 00:34:19,143
or they'll kill you.

528
00:34:20,856 --> 00:34:22,052
Either way...

529
00:34:23,563 --> 00:34:25,466
they're coming.

530
00:34:30,505 --> 00:34:32,476
And when they've reached
this point

531
00:34:32,509 --> 00:34:35,038
we'll have them in a crossfire.

532
00:34:35,082 --> 00:34:36,551
They won't have a chance.

533
00:34:36,586 --> 00:34:37,953
Now, that is the point.

534
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:40,460
In case you've forgotten,
we're in a war.

535
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:42,763
There are rules, Garak

536
00:34:42,801 --> 00:34:44,134
even in war.

537
00:34:44,171 --> 00:34:46,335
Correction...
humans have rules in war.

538
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:48,278
Rules that tend to make victory

539
00:34:48,315 --> 00:34:50,786
a little harder to achieve,
in my opinion.

540
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,452
So we just... shoot them down?

541
00:34:53,493 --> 00:34:56,227
They wouldn't hesitate
if the situation was reversed.

542
00:34:56,267 --> 00:34:57,964
But we're not the Jem'Hadar.

543
00:34:58,004 --> 00:34:59,029
It is our duty to...

544
00:34:59,074 --> 00:35:00,634
This isn't a vote!

545
00:35:04,353 --> 00:35:06,917
The decision's mine.

546
00:35:06,959 --> 00:35:09,488
And Mr. Garak is right...
we are at war.

547
00:35:09,531 --> 00:35:11,331
Given the choice
between us and them

548
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:13,534
there is no choice.

549
00:35:15,112 --> 00:35:16,308
Let's move out.

550
00:35:22,362 --> 00:35:23,797
I'd say good luck

551
00:35:23,832 --> 00:35:26,464
but I... I don't think
you're going to need it.

552
00:35:26,506 --> 00:35:28,135
Say it anyway, old man.

553
00:35:28,176 --> 00:35:31,617
I'm still hoping there's
another way out of this.

554
00:35:31,651 --> 00:35:33,143
In that case...

555
00:35:33,188 --> 00:35:35,250
good luck, Benjamin.

556
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,689
Damar has been trying
to contact you

557
00:36:02,726 --> 00:36:04,423
for the past five hours.

558
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:13,115
I keep going over it
and over it in my mind.

559
00:36:13,151 --> 00:36:15,247
And I can't believe that...

560
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:18,590
that I stood there...

561
00:36:20,168 --> 00:36:22,435
ready to use force
to stop a protest

562
00:36:22,473 --> 00:36:23,806
against the Dominion.

563
00:36:23,843 --> 00:36:25,142
Me.

564
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:30,854
When I was in the resistance,
I despised people like me.

565
00:36:33,165 --> 00:36:35,102
I'm a collaborator, Odo.

566
00:36:35,137 --> 00:36:36,265
That's not true.

567
00:36:36,307 --> 00:36:38,403
You're doing exactly
what Captain Sisko

568
00:36:38,445 --> 00:36:40,814
wanted you and the rest
of Bajor to do...

569
00:36:40,851 --> 00:36:43,322
remain neutral and stay
out of the fighting.

570
00:36:43,356 --> 00:36:45,350
We used to have a saying
in the resistance:

571
00:36:45,394 --> 00:36:47,888
If you're not fighting them,
you're helping them.

572
00:36:47,934 --> 00:36:49,962
Half the Alpha Quadrant
is out there

573
00:36:50,006 --> 00:36:51,305
right now, fighting
for my freedom

574
00:36:51,343 --> 00:36:52,710
but not me.

575
00:36:54,149 --> 00:36:55,413
What am I doing?

576
00:36:55,452 --> 00:36:57,616
Eating a full meal every day

577
00:36:57,657 --> 00:36:59,422
sleeping in a soft bed...

578
00:36:59,462 --> 00:37:00,590
even write reports

579
00:37:00,632 --> 00:37:03,126
for the murderers
who run this station.

580
00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:07,775
These are difficult
times for everyone.

581
00:37:07,815 --> 00:37:09,580
Do you think it's easy for me

582
00:37:09,619 --> 00:37:12,285
to sit down with Dukat
and Weyoun every day

583
00:37:12,326 --> 00:37:15,424
while they plot the destruction
of the Federation?

584
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:18,098
Odo...

585
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,373
I'm not pointing
a finger at you.

586
00:37:20,412 --> 00:37:22,246
I'm the one who told you

587
00:37:22,283 --> 00:37:24,915
to get more involved
in the first place.

588
00:37:24,957 --> 00:37:27,451
No, this is about me.

589
00:37:28,765 --> 00:37:31,863
This is about being able
to get up in the morning

590
00:37:31,906 --> 00:37:34,640
and look in the mirror
and not feel nauseated

591
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:36,673
by what I see.

592
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:40,817
Yassim was right.

593
00:37:43,133 --> 00:37:46,129
I have to do something.

594
00:37:46,173 --> 00:37:48,371
I have to start to fight back.

595
00:37:48,412 --> 00:37:50,406
That would be a mistake.

596
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:53,116
Active resistance
will trigger a crackdown...

597
00:37:53,157 --> 00:37:54,285
Odo...

598
00:37:54,327 --> 00:37:58,463
I don't want to end up
fighting you, too...

599
00:37:58,503 --> 00:38:00,371
but if I have to...

600
00:38:00,408 --> 00:38:02,379
I will.

601
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:08,282
All right.

602
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:11,357
But let's find
a more discreet place

603
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,735
to plan the new resistance.

604
00:39:03,492 --> 00:39:05,588
Remata'Klan!

605
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:07,122
I want to talk!

606
00:39:10,075 --> 00:39:11,408
Agreed!

607
00:39:20,696 --> 00:39:21,960
Hold this position.

608
00:39:21,999 --> 00:39:24,061
Do not fire unless they do.

609
00:39:24,104 --> 00:39:25,334
Understood.

610
00:39:47,628 --> 00:39:49,656
There's no way
out of this canyon

611
00:39:49,699 --> 00:39:52,729
and we have phasers locked
on every one of you.

612
00:39:55,346 --> 00:39:57,579
It appears you have
a decisive advantage.

613
00:39:57,618 --> 00:39:59,885
To fight a battle
under these circumstances

614
00:39:59,923 --> 00:40:01,119
would serve no purpose.

615
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,720
I'm prepared to offer terms.

616
00:40:02,764 --> 00:40:04,495
Hear me out!

617
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:06,597
I know you need
more ketracel-white.

618
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,169
My doctor can sedate your men

619
00:40:09,212 --> 00:40:11,547
and keep them alive
until we're rescued.

620
00:40:11,584 --> 00:40:14,216
After that, we can put you
in medical stasis

621
00:40:14,258 --> 00:40:16,195
until we secure
a new supply.

622
00:40:16,229 --> 00:40:19,601
The Vorta did not give me
the option to surrender.

623
00:40:19,638 --> 00:40:20,937
Keevan's betrayed you!

624
00:40:24,115 --> 00:40:27,920
He gave us your entire plan
of attack last night.

625
00:40:34,674 --> 00:40:38,376
It was obvious that approaching
your position from this canyon

626
00:40:38,416 --> 00:40:40,683
was a deliberate
tactical error on his part.

627
00:40:40,788 --> 00:40:42,314
You knew?

628
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:44,296
I suspected.

629
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:46,699
Despite what Keevan may think

630
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:50,302
the Jem'Hadar are often
one step ahead of the Vorta.

631
00:40:50,345 --> 00:40:53,011
You can still stay
one step ahead.

632
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,018
Surrender.

633
00:40:54,053 --> 00:40:56,149
I have my orders.

634
00:40:56,192 --> 00:40:57,354
Keevan doesn't deserve

635
00:40:57,395 --> 00:40:59,559
the unwavering loyalty
you're giving him.

636
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:03,234
He does not have to earn
my loyalty, Captain.

637
00:41:03,276 --> 00:41:07,012
He has had it from the moment
I was conceived.

638
00:41:07,051 --> 00:41:08,919
I am a Jem'Hadar.

639
00:41:08,956 --> 00:41:10,927
He is a Vorta.

640
00:41:10,961 --> 00:41:13,398
It is the order of things.

641
00:41:15,905 --> 00:41:18,274
Do you really want
to give up your life

642
00:41:18,312 --> 00:41:20,876
for the order of things?

643
00:41:20,917 --> 00:41:23,411
It is not my life
to give up, Captain.

644
00:41:24,493 --> 00:41:25,757
And it never was.

645
00:41:47,114 --> 00:41:48,948
What'd he say?

646
00:41:50,254 --> 00:41:52,248
All the wrong things.

647
00:41:54,999 --> 00:41:57,597
Our death is glory
to the Founders.

648
00:43:05,869 --> 00:43:07,634
Captain?

649
00:43:24,347 --> 00:43:25,873
You know, Captain

650
00:43:25,917 --> 00:43:30,623
if I had had just two more vials
of white...

651
00:43:30,662 --> 00:43:32,656
you never would've had a chance.

652
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,762
Chief!

653
00:43:34,806 --> 00:43:35,934
Get this...

654
00:43:37,311 --> 00:43:39,407
Take him back to base camp

655
00:43:39,449 --> 00:43:42,354
then get to work
on that com system.

656
00:43:43,393 --> 00:43:44,692
Aye, sir.

657
00:43:44,728 --> 00:43:46,493
Lieutenant Neeley!

658
00:43:46,533 --> 00:43:47,934
Sir?

659
00:43:48,003 --> 00:43:49,803
Form a burial detail.

660
00:43:51,144 --> 00:43:52,203
Aye, sir.
