1
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,747
Shoes.

2
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:41,959
(<i> door opens</i> )

3
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:46,755
Jake, I've got a terrific
surprise for you.

4
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:49,758
Oh, yeah?
What is it?

5
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,176
The two of us
are going to Bajor

6
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,012
for the start of the
Gratitude Festival.

7
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:54,805
What's
the Gratitude Festival?

8
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:57,641
It's the biggest Bajoran
holiday of the year.

9
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:59,685
Major Kira says
it's pretty spectacular.

10
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,645
And I figured while
we were on the surface,

11
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:02,938
we could visit
those fire caverns

12
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:04,189
you've been wanting
to see.

13
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,066
Sounds great.
When do we leave?

14
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,151
This afternoon,
right after school.

15
00:01:09,862 --> 00:01:11,697
For how long?

16
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:13,156
Three days.

17
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,242
Three days?

18
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,118
Computer, orange juice.

19
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,871
Dad, do I have to go?

20
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:20,998
Well, no...

21
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:22,457
not if you don't want to.

22
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,083
Thanks, Dad.

23
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:25,961
Nog and I kind of
have plans for tomorrow.

24
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:27,922
What kind of plans?
There's an Andorian freighter

25
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:30,424
due in for a maintenance check
tomorrow night.

26
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,051
An Andorian
freighter?

27
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:34,053
Uh, it's supposed to be carrying
a shipment

28
00:01:34,053 --> 00:01:36,137
of those new antigrav tractors.

29
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:39,266
We're hoping
we'll get a chance to see one.

30
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:40,893
Uh, let me get
this straight.

31
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:43,854
You would rather hang around
a cargo bay with Nog

32
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:46,982
than visit the Bajoran
fire caverns with the old man?

33
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:49,068
Nog's my friend.

34
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,783
No need to thank me, madam.

35
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,325
Here at Quark's

36
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:00,662
customer satisfaction
is our primary concern.

37
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,998
Now, you run along
back to the dabo table.

38
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,128
Rom, that lady tells me

39
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,714
she misplaced a
fat currency pouch.

40
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,925
Yes, brother?
And that you found it.

41
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:14,342
Yes, brother.

42
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:16,553
And that you returned
it to her intact.

43
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,806
I was dazzled by her beauty.

44
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:20,766
You worthless,
tiny-eared fool.

45
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,684
Don't you know the First
Rule of Acquisition?

46
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,979
Yes, brother.
Then say it.

47
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:29,316
"Once you have their money,
you never give it back."

48
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,943
Exactly.

49
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:32,861
You can ponder its
meaning this evening

50
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:36,239
while polishing every
rail in the place.

51
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,033
Now get out of my sight

52
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:40,452
before I toss you out
the nearest airlock.

53
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:43,914
(<i> growling</i> )

54
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:52,297
Nog!

55
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,133
(<i> crashing and clattering</i> )

56
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:55,968
Is this what
they teach you

57
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:58,012
at that human
school of yours?

58
00:02:58,012 --> 00:02:59,387
Sloth and indolence?

59
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:02,390
No, Father.
We'll see about that.

60
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,268
Tonight, you'll polish
every rail in the place

61
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,938
until they sparkle.
Is that clear?

62
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,898
Yes, Father, tonight--
every rail.

63
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:25,622
And, so, the Andorian says,

64
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:30,585
"Your brother?
I thought it was your wife."

65
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:36,133
Get it?
"Wife..."

66
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,135
(<i> laughing</i> )

67
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,846
Had to think about that one,
didn't you?

68
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,764
I'm looking
for Quark.

69
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:43,974
You found him.

70
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,435
I'm Krax,

71
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:51,356
and this is my father,
Grand Nagus Zek.

72
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,579
Tell me, is the Grand Nagus here

73
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,789
on business
or pleasure?

74
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,208
Is there a difference?

75
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,584
No, of course not.

76
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,712
My father will reveal
the purpose of his visit

77
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,380
when he sees fit.

78
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,717
As for now, he desires
the use of a holosuite.

79
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:21,053
He's heard that some
of your programs

80
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:22,512
are quite alluring.

81
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,264
Oh, they are, they are.

82
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:28,268
But, uh, they may prove
a touch energetic

83
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,021
for his advanced
years.

84
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,856
Are you refusing
his request?

85
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,649
Not at all,
not at all.

86
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,736
Is there a particular activity
he'd like to sample?

87
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:39,654
The Nagus dislikes
having to choose

88
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,656
between so many
delightful possibilities.

89
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,784
In that case...
(<i> snaps fingers</i> )

90
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,622
Here's a list
of five programs

91
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:51,625
that rank among
my personal favorites.

92
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,669
I'd be happy
to select one for him.

93
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,630
That won't be necessary.

94
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,925
The Nagus has decided
to try all five.

95
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,594
(<i> chuckling</i> )

96
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,795
(<i> kids laughing</i>
<i>and chattering</i> )

97
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,215
Sorry I'm late,

98
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:06,051
but the transporter in Ops
needed a minor adjustment

99
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,303
in its upper
molecular imaging scanner.

100
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,305
(<i> laughter continues</i> )

101
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,473
But never mind that.

102
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,226
All right, let's settle down.

103
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:16,811
Let's settle down!

104
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,399
Jake, Nog!

105
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,983
What we do is....

106
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,110
Nog!

107
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,739
Thank you.

108
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:31,285
Now, we only have two more weeks
to get through

109
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,954
before Mrs. O'Brien
returns from Earth.

110
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,706
So that shouldn't be
too difficult.

111
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,084
Right?

112
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:43,004
Right. Let's get out
our homework padds.

113
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,424
We'll begin
with the older students.

114
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:47,550
Your last assignment

115
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,845
was to write an essay
defining the term "ethics."

116
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,139
Let's start with...

117
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,099
Nog.

118
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,437
I don't have my essay.

119
00:07:58,437 --> 00:07:59,479
Why not?

120
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,189
My padd was stolen.

121
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,316
Is that a fact?

122
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,692
Any idea who stole it?

123
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,278
It happened at Quark's.

124
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:08,113
I put it on a table,

125
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:11,491
and there were
some Vulcans nearby...
Hold on.

126
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:15,870
You're saying Vulcans
stole your homework?

127
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,331
Yes, sir.

128
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,833
Any idea why?

129
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,839
Because they don't have ethics?

130
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,215
(<i> kids giggling</i> )

131
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:30,969
All right, that's enough.

132
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,720
It's the truth.

133
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,181
Ask Jake.

134
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,807
He was with me.

135
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,811
Go on.

136
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,688
Tell him.

137
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,775
I guess so.

138
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,111
You<i> guess</i> so?

139
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:53,992
He... yeah.

140
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,786
They took it.
I was there.

141
00:08:56,786 --> 00:09:01,291
All right, but I want
that essay in tomorrow.

142
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,502
Is that understood?
Yes.

143
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:04,752
I hope so.

144
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,758
(<i> Nagus laughing</i> )

145
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,891
Did the Nagus
happen to mention

146
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,894
how<i> long</i> he'd be
using the holosuite?

147
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,313
The Nagus will be done
when he's done.

148
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,981
What if he
injured himself?

149
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,359
My father left
specific instructions

150
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:28,860
not to be disturbed.

151
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,112
Are you suggesting
we disobey him?

152
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,407
Forget I ever said anything.

153
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:44,292
The Grand Nagus--
here under our roof.

154
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,753
I've never been so proud.

155
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,547
I hope you can
live on pride,

156
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:50,131
because that's all
we'll have left

157
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,841
once he's through with us.

158
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,801
You think he's here
to take over the bar?

159
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,803
Why else would he
have come all this way?

160
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:58,265
To buy me out

161
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,183
for a fraction of what
the place is worth.

162
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:02,352
You could always
refuse to sell.

163
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,979
Oh, why didn't I
think of that?

164
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,773
Idiot!

165
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:10,985
The Nagus doesn't take
"no" for an answer.

166
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,695
Quark.

167
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,782
Here.

168
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,119
(<i> moaning</i> )

169
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,791
Good program.

170
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,293
My father requires rest.

171
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:27,794
I would imagine.

172
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:31,172
Uh, please feel free
to use my own...

173
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,924
brother's quarters

174
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:36,136
for as long as
you're with us.

175
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,512
That should be satisfactory.

176
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:40,265
Now, uh, is there
anything else I could do

177
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,642
to make your stay
a pleasant one?

178
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,437
Invite me to dinner.

179
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:47,688
I'd be honored.

180
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,110
Chief, I just heard Airlock 9
is jammed again.

181
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,237
I'll get a crew on it
immediately, Commander.

182
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,363
Ensign Jonas?

183
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,200
So, how's school?

184
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,328
We'll muddle through,
I imagine,

185
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:04,789
though I'm counting the days
till Keiko gets back.

186
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,333
Are the students
giving you a hard time?

187
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,792
Well, you know
how it is, sir.

188
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,961
Kids-- there's nothing
they like better

189
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:12,464
than to take advantage
of a substitute teacher.

190
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:13,840
I always did.

191
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,883
I hope Jake's
behaving himself.

192
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,553
Jake?
He's a fine lad, sir.

193
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,597
It's just...

194
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,390
well...

195
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,975
Just what?

196
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,311
It's just,
if he were my son,

197
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:29,730
I'd find a friend for him
other than Nog.

198
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,983
I'm afraid that's
easier said than done.

199
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:34,861
The two of them have
become inseparable.

200
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,614
I'd find a way
to separate them, sir.

201
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,491
That Nog's a bad influence.

202
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:42,243
I appreciate the advice,
Chief, but I trust my son.

203
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,040
Besides, if I get
between them now,

204
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,833
it would become
me versus Nog

205
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,085
and I'm not going to force
Jake to choose between us.

206
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,504
Why not?

207
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,130
Because I'd probably lose.

208
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,465
Oh, I doubt that, sir.

209
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,884
That's because
your daughter's three.

210
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,387
Wait until she's 14.

211
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,162
Are you sure?

212
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,095
My compliments, Quark.

213
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,347
Mmm! These tube grubs

214
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,266
are chilled
to perfection.

215
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:51,563
Did I say I was finished?

216
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:57,026
Please, help yourself.

217
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:01,197
I ran into
your cousin Barbo recently.

218
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,366
Barbo? I thought he

219
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:06,536
was still in that
Tarahong detention center.

220
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,121
They finally
released him.

221
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,748
How fortunate.

222
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:11,874
He told me how the
two of you sold

223
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,461
those defective warp drives
to the Tarahong government.

224
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,963
Very clever.
Oh, it was nothing.

225
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,132
The Tarahongians are
an incredibly gullible people.

226
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,717
He also told me

227
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:23,136
how you betrayed him
to the authorities

228
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,930
and left him to rot behind bars
while you kept all the profits.

229
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,142
The Sixth Rule of Acquisition
expressly states...

230
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:32,937
"Never allow family to stand
in the way of opportunity."

231
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,397
I certainly never have.

232
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,232
You see?

233
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,318
I told you
he had brains.

234
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:41,820
You've done very well
for yourself, Quark.

235
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,156
Not that well.

236
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,325
Don't contradict
your elders.

237
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,909
It's impolite.

238
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,828
I suppose
I'm doing quite well at that.

239
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:51,998
It was a stroke of brilliance

240
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:55,460
to open a bar so close
to a stable wormhole.

241
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,255
He didn't even know
the wormhole existed!

242
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:02,049
That's what makes it
so impressive.

243
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,344
He had the instinct,
the ears,

244
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:07,722
to make the smart move
before anyone else did.

245
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:11,685
You could learn
from his example.

246
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,064
Boy!

247
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,483
Boy!

248
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,493
Can I go now?

249
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,119
I have homework.

250
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,830
Did he say...

251
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,122
...homework?

252
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,668
KRAX:
There's a Federation
school here

253
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:40,338
run by a hu-man, a female.

254
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:45,719
And you allow your son
to attend such a place?

255
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:48,722
Nog, I never want you to
step foot in there again.

256
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:51,015
Now go to
your room.

257
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,977
And no studying.

258
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,566
My apologies, Nagus.

259
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,818
It's those
Federation do-gooders--

260
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:05,613
always sticking their ugly noses
in other people's business.

261
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,741
Most distressing.

262
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:10,368
Yes, Nagus,
most distressing.

263
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,453
Yes, yes.

264
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,914
Now, speaking of business--

265
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:18,292
Quark, I've come to ask
a favor of you,

266
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:21,462
and one that would be
very important to me.

267
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,214
I need your bar.

268
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:25,842
I knew it.

269
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,635
And your services as host

270
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:31,723
for an important conference
to be held here tomorrow

271
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:33,057
at 9:00 sharp.

272
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,976
I would, uh,
consider it a privilege.

273
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:39,105
And the purpose
of this conference is, uh...?

274
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,607
ZEK:
The future,

275
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:44,151
and for Ferengi
business interests,

276
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,946
the future is already here

277
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,867
and its name
is the Gamma Quadrant.

278
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,212
Ferengi Transport<i> Sepulo</i>

279
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,673
has put in at
Docking Bay 5.

280
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:06,925
That's the third
Ferengi ship

281
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:08,760
to arrive here
in the last 18 hours.

282
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,804
Maybe it's Quark's birthday.

283
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,847
My advice is to lock
up the silverware.

284
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,432
I don't think we have
to go that far.

285
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,935
Sisko to Odo.
Go ahead, Commander.

286
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:20,688
About all of these Ferengi
visitors we've been getting...

287
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,816
I'm already on it.

288
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,152
(<i> genial conversation</i> )

289
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,115
No, no, no!

290
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,659
QUARK:
Is something wrong?

291
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:35,411
You can't seat
Turot next to Hoex.

292
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,622
They've been
bitter rivals

293
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:40,541
ever since Hoex bought out
Turot's controlling interest

294
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,336
in the cargo ports
on Volchok Prime.

295
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:46,923
Rom! Change these seating
arrangements immediately.

296
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,257
Quickly, you fool

297
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:51,218
before I toss you
out the nearest airlock.

298
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,804
I thought you understood

299
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:54,597
this was to be
a private meeting.

300
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:55,932
Yes.

301
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,143
Go away!

302
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,687
We're closed!

303
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:02,772
Go away!

304
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,276
Shoo! Shoo!

305
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,029
What's the delay?

306
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,948
We await
the Grand Nagus.

307
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,950
Well, he better show
his ears soon

308
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,159
or I'm leaving.

309
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,995
No one leaves

310
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:18,955
until the conference
has concluded.

311
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:22,500
Still hiding
in your father's shadow?

312
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,005
The Nagus casts
a very<i> long</i> shadow.

313
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:29,799
Careful you don't
disappear in it!

314
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,885
I see we're all here.

315
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,137
Enough drinks.

316
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,806
All right, I'm going.

317
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,016
Quickly.

318
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:41,477
No, you stay.

319
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,899
Me?

320
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:51,111
Gentlemen,
be seated.

321
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,620
JAKE:
Hey, Nog.

322
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:03,833
Where were you this morning?

323
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,251
I'm through with school.

324
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,003
What do you mean through?

325
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:10,590
I mean I don't have to attend
those boring classes anymore.

326
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,883
Is this your father's idea?

327
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:13,843
It's the right decision.

328
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:16,136
Look, if you want,
I'll talk to Mr. O'Brien.

329
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,514
No.

330
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,725
I don't belong there.

331
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,727
Don't you want to learn things?

332
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,896
You mean like ethics?

333
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:26,564
Yeah, and other stuff.

334
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,274
You don't understand.

335
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,859
I'm a Ferengi.

336
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,403
For me, school is
a waste of time.

337
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:33,821
Why is that?

338
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,115
Because there's
no profit in it.

339
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,533
So why are you
getting mad at me?

340
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,036
Because you're
a stupid hu-man

341
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,872
and I don't know
why I bother with you.

342
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,248
<i>I'm</i> stupid?

343
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:47,001
You're the one
not going to school.

344
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,962
See if I care.

345
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:54,092
And lastly, I would like
to salute Nava,

346
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:57,136
whose takeover of the Arcybite
mining refineries

347
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,056
in the Clarius System
is now complete.

348
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,058
I congratulate you all.

349
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:04,602
Profits are better than ever.

350
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:11,609
Nevertheless, it is becoming
more and more difficult

351
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:14,904
to find truly lucrative
business opportunities

352
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:17,782
here in the Alpha Quadrant.

353
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,408
And why?

354
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,494
Because no matter
where we go,

355
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,497
our reputation
precedes us--

356
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:29,543
a reputation tainted
by the lies of our competitors

357
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,713
who maliciously spread
the erroneous impression

358
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,215
that<i> we</i> are not to be trusted.

359
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:38,970
(<i> outraged grumbling</i> )

360
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:43,766
But now, thanks to the discovery
of the wormhole,

361
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:49,814
for the first time, we can now
avoid such falsehoods.

362
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:52,525
The Gamma Quadrant, gentlemen--

363
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:56,654
millions of new worlds
at our very doorstep.

364
00:19:56,654 --> 00:20:00,491
The potential
for Ferengi business expansion

365
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:03,410
is staggering.

366
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,330
And best of all,

367
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,750
no one there has
ever heard the name Ferengi.

368
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:13,129
Our reputation will be
absolutely stainless.

369
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:15,756
Our word can be our bond.

370
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,842
Until we decide
to break it.

371
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,553
(<i> all laughing</i> )

372
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:25,099
It'll be the good old days
all over again.

373
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:29,729
And who shall lead us
in this great endeavor?

374
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:30,938
Who else,
but my father?

375
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,190
The Nagus.

376
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,941
The Grand Nagus!
Yes! Yes!

377
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,359
Nagus!

378
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,653
I thank you
for your confidence,

379
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:41,323
but I must decline the offer.

380
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,658
But, Father...

381
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,785
I'm old.

382
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,370
The fire dims.

383
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:50,457
I'm just not as greedy
as I used to be.

384
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,710
Yes, you are, more so.

385
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:56,756
No, my mind's made up.

386
00:20:56,756 --> 00:21:00,676
I've already chosen
my successor.

387
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,761
Ooh.
Ooh.
Ooh.

388
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,012
Ahem.

389
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,430
A leader

390
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:08,184
whose vision, imagination
and avarice

391
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:12,230
will oversee Ferengi ventures
in the Gamma Quadrant.

392
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:17,068
The new Grand Nagus...

393
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:19,904
Quark!

394
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:23,866
(<i> shouting</i> )

395
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,492
He's a lobeless amateur!

396
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,912
Father, have you
lost your mind?

397
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,705
I won't stand for it!

398
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,540
This is outrageous!

399
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:42,593
Congratulations.

400
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:46,806
I know you'll do
a wonderful job.

401
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:58,609
(<i> laughing</i> )

402
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:18,045
Oatmeal lumpy again?

403
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,506
No, I'm just not hungry.

404
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:21,924
Want to talk about it?

405
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:23,759
It's Nog.

406
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,971
His father's pulled him
out of school.

407
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,264
I see.

408
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:29,932
It's not fair.

409
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:31,934
Nog can't even read.

410
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:34,895
School's not going
to be much fun without him.

411
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:38,316
You can still get together
with him after school.

412
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:42,153
Maybe. I don't think he wants
to be my friend anymore.

413
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:43,946
Did he say why?

414
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:46,740
He says humans and Ferengis
don't get along.

415
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,992
Usually they don't.

416
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:50,077
But you're the one
always saying

417
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,621
that we should make friends
with other cultures.

418
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:55,916
I believe that,
and I'm glad
you believe it, too

419
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:59,170
but human values
and Ferengi values
are very different.

420
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:02,006
We've never been able
to form a common bond.

421
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:04,050
So Nog goes his way,
and I go mine.

422
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,634
These things happen.

423
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:11,182
Hey, how about after school,
we play a little baseball?

424
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:14,060
I can't.

425
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,603
I have something to do.

426
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:27,073
Grand Nagus Quark.
I love the sound of that.

427
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:30,368
I'm afraid we were never
formally introduced.

428
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:33,079
I am Gral,
your new best friend.

429
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,621
You wish to serve me?

430
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,207
I wish to protect you.

431
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:37,917
Protect me?

432
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,711
From those who are jealous
of your position

433
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:42,880
and wish to take
your place.

434
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,132
They can be
very dangerous.

435
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:50,512
How do I stop them?

436
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:51,889
Leave it to me.

437
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:54,558
I'm not going
to allow anybody

438
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:58,020
to harm such a grateful friend
as yourself.

439
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,275
How grateful am I?

440
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:05,443
Grateful enough to make sure
that I have my pick

441
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:07,947
of the most lucrative
Gamma Quadrant opportunities.

442
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,698
And if I refuse?

443
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:13,702
You won't.

444
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:28,050
Nagus, I'm
in desperate trouble.

445
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:31,553
So am I-- and please,
call me Zek.

446
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:35,975
Now, which would you choose--
Risa or Balosnee VI?

447
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,393
I don't quite follow.

448
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,312
For my vacation.

449
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:42,815
My first in 85 years.

450
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:45,025
I'm told, on Balosnee,

451
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:47,361
the soothing harmonies
of the tides

452
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:51,782
can cause the most
stimulating hallucinations,

453
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:57,204
but when I think of those
voluptuous Risian females...

454
00:24:57,204 --> 00:25:00,124
Nagus, please...

455
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:01,875
Gral just threatened my life.

456
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,462
So he's the first, is he?

457
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:06,172
Well, he won't be the last.

458
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:07,881
But what am I to do?

459
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,425
You picked me
for your successor.

460
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:11,218
Surely, you must have
some advice.

461
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,887
To survive, you must
surround yourself

462
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,306
with loyal men.

463
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:16,849
That's good.

464
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,392
But not too loyal.

465
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:21,228
Never trust anyone who
places your prosperity

466
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:23,439
above their own.
I see.

467
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:26,066
And remember, when
in doubt, be ruthless.

468
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:30,779
Yes. I can do that.

469
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,032
Go on.

470
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,076
Zek?

471
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,038
Zek?!

472
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:54,428
I didn't do anything.

473
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:01,768
I don't know, Krax.

474
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:06,482
20 bars of gold-
pressed latinum?

475
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:10,986
Uh... I'll need
to think about it.

476
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,446
In a year, it'll be
worth twice as much.

477
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:14,448
All right, I'll take it.

478
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:17,535
You want<i> me</i> to be
your bodyguard?

479
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:19,119
Think of it as a promotion.

480
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,247
But why me?

481
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:24,333
You're the only one left
I can trust.

482
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:27,294
You're
my closest associate.

483
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:29,338
My friend, my brother.

484
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:31,048
But I thought...

485
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:34,218
since you'll be so busy
being Grand Nagus,

486
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:37,471
I could take over
running the bar.

487
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:41,475
(<i> laughing</i> )

488
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:43,477
You-- run my bar?

489
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:55,573
Not exactly overcome
by grief, are we?

490
00:26:55,573 --> 00:26:58,075
This is a private
funeral service.

491
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:00,911
Hmm. You have my sympathies
for your loss.

492
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:04,081
Nevertheless, when someone
dies on my station,

493
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:08,043
there are questions
that must be answered.

494
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,628
There was nothing suspicious
about my father's death.

495
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:12,339
It was caused
by a massive infection

496
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,715
of the tympanic
membrane--

497
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,050
a chronic condition.

498
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,676
Then I hope you won't mind

499
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:20,097
if I ask Dr. Bashir
to examine the body.

500
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:21,307
(<i> giggling</i> )

501
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:23,267
That would be difficult.

502
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:24,851
What's this?

503
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:26,437
My piece of Zek.

504
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:28,897
You see, when a Ferengi
of my father's stature dies,

505
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,150
the body is automatically
vacuum-desiccated,

506
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,277
and sold
as a prized collectible.

507
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:36,071
How touching.

508
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:55,799
I know there's...
I wonder...

509
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,218
Go ahead.
It wasn't important.

510
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:00,220
I guess humans
and Ferengis

511
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,348
don't have a lot
to talk about.

512
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:05,392
That's what my father says.
Mine, too.

513
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:08,187
That doesn't mean
they're right.

514
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:11,398
We always had stuff
to talk about before.

515
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,442
So, what do you say--

516
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:16,445
you still want
to be friends?

517
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:20,032
Yes.

518
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:25,371
When my father finds out,
he won't be happy.

519
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:28,081
Neither will mine.

520
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:31,335
Come on, I have
a great idea.

521
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:34,046
What is it?
Come on.

522
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:39,426
So, what exactly does it mean
becoming Grand Nagus?

523
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:42,846
It means that, from now on,
if you wish to speak to me,

524
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:45,182
you must first make
an appointment with Rom.

525
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:46,684
Don't be ludicrous.

526
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:48,935
It is also customary
to show respect

527
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:52,481
by kissing my scepter.

528
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:56,276
(<i> snorts</i> )

529
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,153
(<i> chuckling</i> )

530
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:02,366
I suppose I could make
an exception in your case.

531
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:03,659
(<i> coin clattering</i> )

532
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:16,963
(<i> screams</i> )

533
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:23,596
You see the discoloration
around the impact perimeter?

534
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:26,098
These are sorium
and argine traces.

535
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,225
Aren't they Ferengi explosives?

536
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:31,019
Exactly. What we have here
is a Ferengi locator bomb

537
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,272
designed to lock on
to a target's pheromones.

538
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,315
You mean they're
attracted to body odor?

539
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,693
Mm-hmm. Very deadly
and very accurate.

540
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:40,404
If Quark hadn't lowered
his head at the last second...

541
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:42,114
Commander.
Yes, Doctor?

542
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,199
I've just given Quark
a thorough examination.

543
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,118
He's a bit shaken
up, nothing more.

544
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:48,995
I guess it's time
to have a little chat

545
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:50,372
with the Grand Nagus.

546
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:52,332
ODO:
I'd be delighted.

547
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,962
(<i> boys laughing</i> )

548
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,303
When are you
going to get it through

549
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:05,804
your twisted
little brain that

550
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,723
we are trying
to save your life?

551
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:09,975
You're trying to interfere
in Ferengi affairs of state.

552
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,393
Which are none of your concern.

553
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:13,019
Now, look here, Quark...

554
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:16,231
Uh-uh-uh--
<i>Grand Nagus</i> Quark.

555
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:19,025
Those locator bombs
are damn near foolproof.

556
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,736
You were lucky once.

557
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:22,446
Next time, we could be
scraping you off the walls.

558
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:25,783
The Grand Nagus does not ask
for help from outsiders.

559
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:28,868
ODO:
I'm sure whoever tried to kill
you is counting on that.

560
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,454
You must have some suspicion
who that could be.

561
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:31,955
I'm suspicious
of everybody.

562
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,540
But who would you say

563
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,584
stands to benefit
the most from your death?

564
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,169
Let's see.

565
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:39,421
That would have
to be Krax.

566
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:42,758
Yes, if anything
were to happen to me,
Krax becomes Nagus.

567
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:45,427
True, but let's not forget that
it was Gral who threatened you.

568
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:46,595
(<i> snarls</i> )

569
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:48,888
Threatened you?
How?

570
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,849
That's none of your concern.

571
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:54,144
Besides, Gral and Krax
were at the funeral

572
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:56,146
when the bomb went off

573
00:30:56,146 --> 00:31:00,567
which means that neither one
of them could have set it.

574
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:03,570
Whoever planned this could
have had an accomplice.

575
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:07,324
You're sure all of Zek's
associates attended the funeral?

576
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:09,117
Yes, yes, they were all there.

577
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,994
Look, this is getting
us nowhere.

578
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,371
What about Zek's servant?

579
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:13,997
ROM:
You mean Maihar'du?

580
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,207
What about him?

581
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,875
Was he at the funeral?

582
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,877
I don't recall
seeing him there.

583
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:19,837
Do you?

584
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:21,755
Now that you mention it--

585
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:23,006
no, I don't.

586
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,051
Interesting.

587
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:28,011
Hupyrian servants are renowned

588
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,556
for their devotion
to their employers.

589
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:33,475
For Maihar'du
not to have shown up

590
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:36,520
at Zek's funeral
is very odd indeed.

591
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:47,906
You were out pretty
late last night.

592
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,115
I was?

593
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:51,117
You came in after midnight.

594
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:54,371
Uh... I guess I got
kind of busy doing stuff.

595
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:55,873
What kind of stuff?

596
00:31:55,873 --> 00:31:57,916
Nothing important,
just hanging around.

597
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,251
With Nog.

598
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:01,294
We weren't doing
anything wrong.

599
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,505
Good. Then you can
tell me all about it.

600
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:10,011
I can't.
It's private.

601
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:12,556
Private?

602
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:16,894
I got to go,
or I'll be late for school.

603
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:19,772
I want you home
in time for dinner.
Understood?

604
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:24,150
Understood.

605
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:33,993
The thing is, uh... Nagus,

606
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:40,041
I feel I've done all I can
in the field of gouge mining.

607
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,628
You wish
to find profit elsewhere?

608
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:44,045
Yes, Nagus.

609
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:46,548
Where would that be?

610
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:49,008
I'd like the chance

611
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:53,305
to introduce synthehol
to the Gamma Quadrant.

612
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:58,977
A very lucrative opportunity.

613
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:02,314
Tell me, Nava,

614
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:05,943
when Zek announced
I was to succeed him,

615
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:07,235
were you pleased?

616
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:11,072
Uh... no, Nagus.

617
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,995
Did you come to me
and offer your support?

618
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,834
No, Nagus.

619
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,838
Yet now you call me Nagus,

620
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:28,799
but is it
out of true friendship?

621
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,803
No, you only pretend
to show me respect

622
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:36,431
so I will grant you
this immense opportunity.

623
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:39,434
Which I'm willing
to split with you-- 50-50?

624
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,520
Well, in that case,

625
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,606
let's hope the Gamma Quadrant
develops a taste for synthehol.

626
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:45,858
(<i> laughs</i> )

627
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:48,067
Oh, yes.

628
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,281
A very smart deal, Nagus.

629
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:56,576
I seem to have
a knack for it, don't I?

630
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,077
ROM:
Yes, Nagus.

631
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:01,540
The rest will have
to come back tomorrow.

632
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,834
All this benevolence wearies me.

633
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:05,002
Yes, Nagus.

634
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:06,753
KRAX:
As you wish, Nagus.

635
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:09,631
I think
I'll head over to the bar

636
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:10,841
and check the receipts.

637
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:12,425
Yes, Nagus.
Yes, Nagus.

638
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:22,060
If he keeps handing out
these choice opportunities,

639
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,898
he's going to
become very popular.

640
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:29,693
We'll just have to come up
with a new plan.

641
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:33,906
Something more reliable
than a locator bomb.

642
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:37,075
Something that
can't possibly fail

643
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,745
to kill my dear brother.

644
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:42,706
(<i> chuckling</i> )

645
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:51,089
(<i> door chimes</i> )

646
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,841
Come in.

647
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:56,887
I was going to ask you

648
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:58,638
to join me in a round
of Jokarian chess,

649
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:01,224
but I can see you're just
sitting down to dinner.

650
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,642
I sat down
half an hour ago

651
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:05,020
about the time Jake
was supposed to be home.

652
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,773
Aubergine stew.

653
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:09,482
Looks delicious.

654
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,026
So, where's Jake?

655
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:13,737
Where else?
With Nog.

656
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:16,698
Going through my own adolescence
was difficult enough.

657
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:18,909
Surviving my son's
is going to take a miracle.

658
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:22,287
Maybe it's time you had
a little talk with Jake.

659
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:24,831
Children need to know
their boundaries.

660
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,583
I should know.

661
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,251
I've been a mother three times
and a father twice.

662
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,878
Which was easier?

663
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:33,548
Actually, I wasn't
very successful either way,

664
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:37,385
so... feel free to reject
what I'm about to say,

665
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,763
but if I were you,
I would go find Jake,

666
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:42,474
and bring him here
to eat his dinner.

667
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:44,434
You would?

668
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:46,144
Absolutely.

669
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:52,734
Computer, locate Jake Sisko.

670
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:56,029
Jake Sisko is in Cargo Bay 14.

671
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:59,324
Thanks, old man.

"System."

"System."

679
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,936
That was pretty good.

You want to strangle me?

My apologies, Nagus.

695
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:02,303
Stop daydreaming.

696
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,139
Pay attention
to your work.

697
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:06,725
Yes, Nagus.
When do we leave?

698
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:09,061
Just as soon
as you're ready, Nagus.

699
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:11,396
I've always wanted
to take a trip

700
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:12,939
through the wormhole.

701
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,066
Still, it's odd...

702
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:16,193
Zek never mentioned

703
00:37:16,193 --> 00:37:18,277
that he'd traveled
to the Gamma Quadrant

704
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:20,864
let alone opened negotiations
with one of its worlds.

705
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:23,491
Negotiations that you will have
the honor of completing.

706
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,202
According to Krax,

707
00:37:25,202 --> 00:37:27,954
Stakoron II contains
rich deposits of mizainite ore.

708
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,165
A very lucrative
opportunity.

709
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:31,875
Quark?

710
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:34,252
What now?

711
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,922
About the bar...

712
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:40,967
you have so much,
and I have so little...

713
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:44,429
Which is exactly
how it was meant to be.

714
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:47,640
Come.

715
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,019
Let's not keep
our new partners waiting.

716
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:10,205
May I say, Nagus,
that my father himself

717
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:12,165
never looked
more commanding.

I've been thinking,

719
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:14,960
maybe it would be wise

720
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,420
to take a dabo girl along
with us.

721
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,131
Whatever for?

722
00:38:19,131 --> 00:38:22,842
A pretty woman by my side
would only add to my prestige.

723
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,343
Never underestimate

724
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:26,554
the importance
of a first impression.

725
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:29,057
One look at your
imposing features,

726
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:30,976
and the Stakoron
negotiators

727
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:33,603
will give us
everything we ask for.

728
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:36,731
All right.

729
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,901
If you really think
I won't need her...

730
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:41,987
Believe me,
you won't.

731
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:43,905
Shall we?

732
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,465
(<i> door panel beeping</i> )

733
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:19,983
This is an historic moment.

734
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,987
Nagus.

735
00:39:29,326 --> 00:39:31,828
There must be some mistake.

736
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:36,582
There's no ship docked here.

737
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:39,085
Wait!

738
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:41,004
Rom, you idiot!

739
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:44,966
QUARK:
Krax, what are you
standing there for?

740
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:47,635
What's the matter with you two?

741
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:51,097
Open the door!

742
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:54,059
Do you hear me?!

743
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:55,476
Open up!

744
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,939
You must obey your Nagus!

745
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:03,276
Sorry, Quark, but you've just
been voted out of office.

746
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:07,446
Rom! Brother!

747
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:09,032
Please!

748
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:13,828
So,<i> you</i> were going
to toss me out an airlock.

749
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,414
I never meant it.

750
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,124
ROM:
Well,<i> I</i> do.

751
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:19,834
"Rom's."

752
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,670
Nice name for a bar,
don't you think?

753
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,005
Enough talk.

754
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,506
Let's get this started.

755
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:28,051
Would you like
to do the honors?

756
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:29,844
Or should I?

757
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,470
QUARK:
Let me out!

758
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:38,019
Let me out of here!

759
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:42,107
Please...

760
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:44,276
Release him!

761
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,070
Nagus!

762
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,988
You're alive!
You're alive!

763
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,160
Well, Quark,

764
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,955
looks like you needed
my help after all.

765
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:59,582
ZEK:
Don't you recognize
your father?

766
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,209
You died.

767
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:03,086
I saw it happen.

768
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:05,671
You saw me enter
a Dolbargy sleeping trance.

769
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,132
Maihar'du taught it to me.

770
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:08,300
But why, Father?

771
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,884
It was a test

772
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:13,512
to see if you were
ready to take my place,

773
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:16,557
and you failed... miserably!

774
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,853
But, Father, I am ready.

775
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,814
I am ready.

776
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,232
You saw for yourself.

777
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:26,067
I was about
to grab power!

778
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:27,819
You don't grab power.

779
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:31,281
You accumulate it quietly
without anyone noticing.

780
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:33,199
But I don't understand.

781
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,784
The bar, you fool.

782
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:36,035
That was the key.

783
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,870
All those visitors
stopping by

784
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:40,373
on their way
to and from the wormhole.

785
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:43,376
You could have sat there
quietly at your leisure

786
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:46,171
and gathered up
all the information you needed

787
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:48,589
about the Gamma Quadrant.
What about him?

788
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:51,176
Oh, you could have let him
hold the scepter

789
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:53,594
while you controlled everything
from the shadows.

790
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,805
And then, when everything
was running smoothly,

791
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:58,016
only then
would you take over.

792
00:41:58,016 --> 00:41:59,476
But, Father...

793
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:01,353
No! I'm not interested
in excuses!

794
00:42:01,353 --> 00:42:03,062
Go back to the ship.

795
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:05,106
We'll be
leaving here shortly.

796
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:06,732
Yes, Father.

797
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:08,067
It's like...

798
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:10,695
it's like talking to a Klingon.

799
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:18,619
QUARK:
I guess this
still belongs to you.

800
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,538
Yes.

801
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:23,249
It looks like I'll have
to remain Grand Nagus

802
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:26,544
long enough to establish
a Ferengi presence

803
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,754
in the Gamma Quadrant.

804
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:31,841
And I was really looking
forward to retirement.

805
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:34,552
If I hear of any good
Gamma Quadrant deals

806
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:37,389
you'd be right for,
I'll let you know.

807
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:38,931
You know where to find me.

808
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,809
You've done a very
profitable job

809
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,061
with this place.

810
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:45,730
Who knows,
maybe one day,

811
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:48,649
I'll come back
and buy it from you.

812
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:51,403
(<i> laughing</i> )

813
00:42:51,403 --> 00:42:53,863
(<i> laughing</i> )

814
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:57,492
So, Rom...

815
00:42:57,492 --> 00:43:00,870
you were going to toss
me out an airlock.

816
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:04,082
Forgive me, brother.

817
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:05,500
Forgive you?!

818
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,001
Why, brother...

819
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:10,963
I didn't think
you had the lobes.

820
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:13,966
Such wonderful treachery
deserves a reward.

821
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:15,885
I'm going to make you
the assistant manager

822
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:17,929
of policy and clientele
here at Quark's.

823
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:20,390
What exactly
does that mean?

824
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:21,807
How should I know?

825
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:23,351
I just made it up.

826
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:25,895
Come on,
I'll buy you a drink.

827
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:29,023
So what time tomorrow?

828
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:32,193
How about as soon
as you get out of school?

829
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:38,074
BOTH:
Whoa.

830
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:45,831
Jake.

831
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,419
Dad.

832
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:53,089
What are you doing here?

833
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:55,925
I was waiting for you.

834
00:43:55,925 --> 00:43:59,095
(<i> chuckling</i> )

835
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:04,601
Dad...

836
00:44:04,601 --> 00:44:07,728
You're a great boy,
you know that?

837
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,233
Now go be with your friend.
