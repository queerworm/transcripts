1
00:00:37,934 --> 00:00:39,266
Shoes.

2
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,514
Jake, I've got a terrific
surprise for you.

3
00:00:47,554 --> 00:00:50,583
Oh, yeah?
What is it?

4
00:00:50,626 --> 00:00:51,855
The two of us are going to Bajor

5
00:00:51,895 --> 00:00:53,762
for the start
of the Gratitude Festival.

6
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:55,598
What's the Gratitude Festival?

7
00:00:55,636 --> 00:00:58,267
It's the biggest Bajoran
holiday of the year.

8
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,278
Major Kira says
it's pretty spectacular.

9
00:01:00,312 --> 00:01:02,179
And I figured
while we were on the surface

10
00:01:02,216 --> 00:01:03,650
we could visit
those fire caverns

11
00:01:03,686 --> 00:01:04,881
you've been wanting to see.

12
00:01:04,921 --> 00:01:06,720
Sounds great.
When do we leave?

13
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:08,752
This afternoon,
right after school.

14
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,194
For how long?

15
00:01:12,236 --> 00:01:13,534
Three days.

16
00:01:13,571 --> 00:01:15,564
Three days?

17
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,512
Computer, orange juice.

18
00:01:17,546 --> 00:01:19,243
Dad, do I have to go?

19
00:01:19,316 --> 00:01:21,252
Well, no...

20
00:01:21,287 --> 00:01:22,778
not if you don't want to.

21
00:01:22,824 --> 00:01:24,053
Thanks, Dad.

22
00:01:24,093 --> 00:01:26,256
Nog and I kind of have plans
for tomorrow.

23
00:01:26,297 --> 00:01:27,891
What kind of plans?

24
00:01:27,934 --> 00:01:28,993
There's an Andorian freighter

25
00:01:29,036 --> 00:01:30,767
due in for a maintenance check
tomorrow night.

26
00:01:30,807 --> 00:01:31,775
An Andorian freighter?

27
00:01:31,809 --> 00:01:34,440
Uh, it's supposed to be carrying
a shipment

28
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,677
of those new antigrav tractors.

29
00:01:36,718 --> 00:01:39,656
We're hoping
we'll get a chance to see one.

30
00:01:39,691 --> 00:01:41,422
Uh, let me get this straight.

31
00:01:41,461 --> 00:01:44,194
You would rather hang around
a cargo bay with Nog

32
00:01:44,233 --> 00:01:47,228
than visit the Bajoran
fire caverns with the old man?

33
00:01:47,272 --> 00:01:49,265
Nog's my friend.

34
00:01:54,286 --> 00:01:56,256
No need to thank me, madam.

35
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,588
Here at Quark's

36
00:01:57,627 --> 00:02:01,122
customer satisfaction
is our primary concern.

37
00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:03,501
Now, you run along
back to the dabo table.

38
00:02:05,877 --> 00:02:08,713
Rom, that lady tells me

39
00:02:08,749 --> 00:02:11,151
she misplaced
a fat currency pouch.

40
00:02:11,187 --> 00:02:12,246
Yes, brother?

41
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:13,450
And that you found it.

42
00:02:13,491 --> 00:02:14,550
Yes, brother.

43
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:16,961
And that you returned
it to her intact.

44
00:02:16,999 --> 00:02:18,798
I was dazzled by her beauty.

45
00:02:18,836 --> 00:02:21,399
You worthless, tiny-eared fool.

46
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,137
Don't you know
the First Rule of Acquisition?

47
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:24,145
Yes, brother.

48
00:02:24,179 --> 00:02:25,545
Then say it.

49
00:02:25,582 --> 00:02:30,023
"Once you have their money,
you never give it back."

50
00:02:30,058 --> 00:02:31,321
Exactly.

51
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,330
You can ponder its meaning
this evening

52
00:02:33,364 --> 00:02:37,327
while polishing
every rail in the place.

53
00:02:37,406 --> 00:02:38,669
Now get out of my sight

54
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:40,975
before I toss you out
the nearest airlock.

55
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,829
Nog!

56
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:58,578
Is this what they teach you
at that human school of yours?

57
00:02:58,615 --> 00:02:59,981
Sloth and indolence?

58
00:03:00,018 --> 00:03:01,316
No, Father.

59
00:03:01,354 --> 00:03:02,686
We'll see about that.

60
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,821
Tonight, you'll polish
every rail in the place

61
00:03:05,863 --> 00:03:07,126
until they sparkle.

62
00:03:07,165 --> 00:03:08,292
Is that clear?

63
00:03:08,334 --> 00:03:09,461
Yes, Father, tonight...

64
00:03:09,503 --> 00:03:11,268
every rail.

65
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:26,069
And, so, the Andorian says

66
00:03:26,103 --> 00:03:31,341
"Your brother?
I thought it was your wife."

67
00:03:33,217 --> 00:03:34,583
Get it?

68
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,681
"Wife..."

69
00:03:38,762 --> 00:03:41,290
Had to think about that one,
didn't you?

70
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,166
I'm looking for Quark.

71
00:03:43,204 --> 00:03:44,536
You found him.

72
00:03:46,544 --> 00:03:47,978
I'm Krax

73
00:03:48,014 --> 00:03:52,979
and this is my father,
Grand Nagus Zek.

74
00:04:03,946 --> 00:04:06,007
Tell me, is the Grand Nagus here

75
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,179
on business or pleasure?

76
00:04:08,221 --> 00:04:09,689
Is there a difference?

77
00:04:09,723 --> 00:04:11,021
No, of course not.

78
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,521
My father will reveal
the purpose of his visit

79
00:04:14,566 --> 00:04:15,864
when he sees fit.

80
00:04:15,903 --> 00:04:19,307
As for now, he desires
the use of a holosuite.

81
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:21,745
He's heard
that some of your programs

82
00:04:21,782 --> 00:04:23,080
are quite alluring.

83
00:04:23,117 --> 00:04:24,551
Oh, they are, they are.

84
00:04:24,586 --> 00:04:28,924
But, uh, they may prove
a touch energetic

85
00:04:28,962 --> 00:04:31,593
for his advanced years.

86
00:04:31,634 --> 00:04:33,570
Are you refusing his request?

87
00:04:33,604 --> 00:04:35,004
Not at all, not at all.

88
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:38,572
Is there a particular activity
he'd like to sample?

89
00:04:38,614 --> 00:04:40,311
The Nagus dislikes
having to choose

90
00:04:40,351 --> 00:04:42,253
between so many
delightful possibilities.

91
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:43,279
In that case...

92
00:04:46,832 --> 00:04:49,234
Here's a list of five programs

93
00:04:49,269 --> 00:04:52,264
that rank among
my personal favorites.

94
00:04:52,309 --> 00:04:55,281
I'd be happy
to select one for him.

95
00:04:55,315 --> 00:04:57,308
That won't be necessary.

96
00:04:57,352 --> 00:05:00,518
The Nagus has decided
to try all five.

97
00:07:01,935 --> 00:07:03,369
Sorry I'm late

98
00:07:03,405 --> 00:07:06,377
but the transporter in Ops
needed a minor adjustment

99
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:08,438
in its upper
molecular imaging scanner.

100
00:07:10,452 --> 00:07:12,581
But never mind that.

101
00:07:12,623 --> 00:07:14,354
All right, let's settle down.

102
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:16,829
Let's settle down!

103
00:07:18,668 --> 00:07:20,467
Jake, Nog!

104
00:07:20,505 --> 00:07:22,099
What we do is...

105
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:23,268
Nog!

106
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,416
Thank you.

107
00:07:27,453 --> 00:07:32,293
Now, we only have two more weeks
to get through

108
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:34,231
before Mrs. O'Brien
returns from Earth.

109
00:07:34,266 --> 00:07:36,736
So that shouldn't be
too difficult.

110
00:07:36,771 --> 00:07:38,239
Right?

111
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:43,009
Right. Let's get out
our homework padds.

112
00:07:43,051 --> 00:07:45,521
We'll begin
with the older students.

113
00:07:45,555 --> 00:07:46,955
Your last assignment

114
00:07:46,992 --> 00:07:50,932
was to write an essay
defining the term "ethics."

115
00:07:50,966 --> 00:07:52,298
Let's start with...

116
00:07:52,336 --> 00:07:54,306
Nog.

117
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,610
I don't have my essay.

118
00:07:58,648 --> 00:07:59,707
Why not?

119
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,276
My padd was stolen.

120
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,549
Is that a fact?

121
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:04,923
Any idea who stole it?

122
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,589
It happened at Quark's.

123
00:08:06,631 --> 00:08:07,997
I put it on a table

124
00:08:08,034 --> 00:08:10,631
and there were
some Vulcans nearby...

125
00:08:10,672 --> 00:08:11,833
Hold on.

126
00:08:11,874 --> 00:08:16,281
You're saying Vulcans
stole your homework?

127
00:08:16,317 --> 00:08:17,615
Yes, sir.

128
00:08:17,653 --> 00:08:20,055
Any idea why?

129
00:08:23,631 --> 00:08:26,296
Because they don't have ethics?

130
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:31,374
All right, that's enough.

131
00:08:31,414 --> 00:08:32,940
It's the truth.

132
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:34,509
Ask Jake.

133
00:08:34,553 --> 00:08:36,250
He was with me.

134
00:08:38,328 --> 00:08:40,298
Go on.

135
00:08:40,332 --> 00:08:41,961
Tell him.

136
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,031
I guess so.

137
00:08:47,145 --> 00:08:48,511
You guess so?

138
00:08:52,723 --> 00:08:54,522
He... yeah.

139
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,858
They took it.

140
00:08:55,895 --> 00:08:57,124
I was there.

141
00:08:57,165 --> 00:09:01,663
All right, but I want
that essay in tomorrow.

142
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:02,800
Is that understood?

143
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:03,811
Yes.

144
00:09:03,845 --> 00:09:04,972
I hope so.

145
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:18,165
Did the Nagus happen to mention

146
00:09:18,207 --> 00:09:21,179
how long he'd be
using the holosuite?

147
00:09:21,213 --> 00:09:23,683
The Nagus will be done
when he's done.

148
00:09:23,718 --> 00:09:25,186
What if he injured himself?

149
00:09:25,221 --> 00:09:27,691
My father left
specific instructions

150
00:09:27,726 --> 00:09:29,126
not to be disturbed.

151
00:09:29,163 --> 00:09:31,497
Are you suggesting
we disobey him?

152
00:09:31,534 --> 00:09:33,731
Forget I ever said anything.

153
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:45,152
The Grand Nagus...
here under our roof.

154
00:09:45,195 --> 00:09:47,256
I've never been so proud.

155
00:09:47,365 --> 00:09:49,028
I hope you can live on pride

156
00:09:49,068 --> 00:09:50,594
because that's all
we'll have left

157
00:09:50,638 --> 00:09:51,867
once he's through with us.

158
00:09:51,907 --> 00:09:54,377
You think he's here
to take over the bar?

159
00:09:54,413 --> 00:09:56,280
Why else would he
have come all this way?

160
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,752
To buy me out

161
00:09:58,788 --> 00:10:00,621
for a fraction of what
the place is worth.

162
00:10:00,658 --> 00:10:02,787
You could always refuse to sell.

163
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:05,426
Oh, why didn't I think of that?

164
00:10:05,468 --> 00:10:07,301
Idiot!

165
00:10:07,405 --> 00:10:11,436
The Nagus doesn't take
"no" for an answer.

166
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,006
Quark.

167
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,079
Here.

168
00:10:22,602 --> 00:10:25,095
Good program.

169
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:26,701
My father requires rest.

170
00:10:26,744 --> 00:10:28,338
I would imagine.

171
00:10:28,381 --> 00:10:31,683
Uh, please feel free
to use my own...

172
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,553
brother's quarters

173
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,586
for as long as you're with us.

174
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,962
That should be satisfactory.

175
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:40,800
Now, uh, is there
anything else I could do

176
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:43,002
to make your stay
a pleasant one?

177
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:45,913
Invite me to dinner.

178
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:48,317
I'd be honored.

179
00:10:49,723 --> 00:10:52,695
Chief, I just heard Airlock 9
is jammed again.

180
00:10:52,729 --> 00:10:54,722
I'll get a crew on it
immediately, Commander.

181
00:10:54,766 --> 00:10:55,791
Ensign Jonas?

182
00:10:57,372 --> 00:10:59,808
So, how's school?

183
00:10:59,843 --> 00:11:01,779
We'll muddle through, I imagine

184
00:11:01,814 --> 00:11:05,116
though I'm counting the days
till Keiko gets back.

185
00:11:05,153 --> 00:11:06,816
Are the students
giving you a hard time?

186
00:11:06,857 --> 00:11:08,120
Well, you know how it is, sir.

187
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,459
Kids... there's nothing
they like better

188
00:11:10,498 --> 00:11:12,866
than to take advantage
of a substitute teacher.

189
00:11:12,903 --> 00:11:14,201
I always did.

190
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:16,232
I hope Jake's behaving himself.

191
00:11:16,277 --> 00:11:17,540
Jake?

192
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:19,549
He's a fine lad, sir.

193
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:20,949
It's just...

194
00:11:20,985 --> 00:11:22,818
well...

195
00:11:22,856 --> 00:11:24,324
Just what?

196
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:26,795
It's just, if he were my son

197
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:30,395
I'd find a friend for him
other than Nog.

198
00:11:30,438 --> 00:11:32,499
I'm afraid that's
easier said than done.

199
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:35,412
The two of them have
become inseparable.

200
00:11:35,481 --> 00:11:38,009
I'd find a way
to separate them, sir.

201
00:11:38,053 --> 00:11:39,989
That Nog's a bad influence.

202
00:11:40,023 --> 00:11:42,688
I appreciate the advice,
Chief, but I trust my son.

203
00:11:46,135 --> 00:11:47,626
Besides, if I get
between them now

204
00:11:47,672 --> 00:11:48,935
it would become me versus Nog

205
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:51,377
and I'm not going to force
Jake to choose between us.

206
00:11:51,413 --> 00:11:52,973
Why not?

207
00:11:53,016 --> 00:11:54,610
Because I'd probably lose.

208
00:11:54,653 --> 00:11:56,053
Oh, I doubt that, sir.

209
00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:58,457
That's because
your daughter's three.

210
00:11:58,494 --> 00:12:00,760
Wait until she's 14.

211
00:12:25,047 --> 00:12:26,607
Are you sure?

212
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:42,405
My compliments, Quark.

213
00:12:42,449 --> 00:12:47,391
Mmm! These tube grubs
are chilled to perfection.

214
00:12:48,561 --> 00:12:51,965
Did I say I was finished?

215
00:12:53,346 --> 00:12:57,047
Please, help yourself.

216
00:12:57,086 --> 00:13:01,049
I ran into
your cousin Barbo recently.

217
00:13:01,094 --> 00:13:02,654
Barbo? I thought he

218
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:06,331
was still in that
Tarahong detention center.

219
00:13:06,372 --> 00:13:08,001
They finally released him.

220
00:13:08,042 --> 00:13:09,203
How fortunate.

221
00:13:09,244 --> 00:13:11,680
He told me
how the two of you sold

222
00:13:11,716 --> 00:13:14,313
those defective warp drives
to the Tarahong government.

223
00:13:14,355 --> 00:13:15,345
Very clever.

224
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,756
Oh, it was nothing.

225
00:13:16,793 --> 00:13:19,492
The Tarahongians are
an incredibly gullible people.

226
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:20,557
He also told me

227
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,036
how you betrayed him
to the authorities

228
00:13:23,072 --> 00:13:25,908
and left him to rot behind bars
while you kept all the profits.

229
00:13:25,977 --> 00:13:29,108
The Sixth Rule of Acquisition
expressly states...

230
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:32,645
"Never allow family to stand
in the way of opportunity."

231
00:13:32,691 --> 00:13:34,217
I certainly never have.

232
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,196
You see?

233
00:13:36,231 --> 00:13:38,292
I told you he had brains.

234
00:13:38,336 --> 00:13:41,570
You've done very well
for yourself, Quark.

235
00:13:41,609 --> 00:13:42,907
Not that well.

236
00:13:42,945 --> 00:13:45,245
Don't contradict your elders.

237
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,945
It's impolite.

238
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:49,616
I suppose
I'm doing quite well at that.

239
00:13:49,658 --> 00:13:51,958
It was a stroke of brilliance

240
00:13:52,063 --> 00:13:55,628
to open a bar so close
to a stable wormhole.

241
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:59,405
He didn't even know
the wormhole existed!

242
00:13:59,445 --> 00:14:02,144
That's what makes it
so impressive.

243
00:14:02,183 --> 00:14:04,380
He had the instinct, the ears

244
00:14:04,422 --> 00:14:07,690
to make the smart move
before anyone else did.

245
00:14:07,728 --> 00:14:11,634
You could learn
from his example.

246
00:14:15,109 --> 00:14:16,908
Boy!

247
00:14:16,946 --> 00:14:18,472
Boy!

248
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,501
Can I go now?

249
00:14:28,536 --> 00:14:30,199
I have homework.

250
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:31,970
Did he say...

251
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:33,307
...homework?

252
00:14:33,345 --> 00:14:36,681
There's a Federation
school here

253
00:14:36,719 --> 00:14:40,454
run by a hu-man, a female.

254
00:14:40,494 --> 00:14:45,994
And you allow your son
to attend such a place?

255
00:14:46,037 --> 00:14:49,009
Nog, I never want you to
step foot in there again.

256
00:14:49,043 --> 00:14:51,138
Now, go to your room.

257
00:14:53,285 --> 00:14:54,914
And no studying.

258
00:14:58,028 --> 00:14:59,360
My apologies, Nagus.

259
00:14:59,397 --> 00:15:01,526
It's those
Federation do-gooders...

260
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:05,600
always sticking their ugly noses
in other people's business.

261
00:15:05,644 --> 00:15:07,978
Most distressing.

262
00:15:08,015 --> 00:15:10,417
Yes, Nagus, most distressing.

263
00:15:10,453 --> 00:15:12,480
Yes, yes.

264
00:15:12,524 --> 00:15:14,926
Now, speaking of business...

265
00:15:14,962 --> 00:15:18,423
Quark, I've come to ask
a favor of you

266
00:15:18,469 --> 00:15:21,464
and one that would be
very important to me.

267
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:23,308
I need your bar.

268
00:15:23,345 --> 00:15:26,010
I knew it.

269
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:27,714
And your services as host

270
00:15:27,754 --> 00:15:31,717
for an important conference
to be held here tomorrow

271
00:15:31,762 --> 00:15:33,230
at 9:00 sharp.

272
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,964
I would, uh,
consider it a privilege.

273
00:15:36,004 --> 00:15:39,306
And the purpose
of this conference is, uh?

274
00:15:39,344 --> 00:15:40,642
The future.

275
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,279
And for Ferengi
business interests

276
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,190
the future is already here

277
00:15:47,226 --> 00:15:50,996
and its name
is the Gamma Quadrant.

278
00:16:01,555 --> 00:16:03,354
Ferengi Transport <i>Sepulo</i>

279
00:16:03,392 --> 00:16:05,692
has put in at Docking Bay 5.

280
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,028
That's the third Ferengi ship

281
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,796
to arrive here
in the last 18 hours.

282
00:16:08,836 --> 00:16:10,772
Maybe it's Quark's birthday.

283
00:16:10,807 --> 00:16:12,834
My advice is to lock
up the silverware.

284
00:16:12,878 --> 00:16:14,472
I don't think we have
to go that far.

285
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,574
Sisko to Odo.

286
00:16:15,617 --> 00:16:16,983
Go ahead, Commander.

287
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:20,720
About all of these Ferengi
visitors we've been getting...

288
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,753
I'm already on it.

289
00:16:28,943 --> 00:16:31,243
No, no, no!

290
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,772
Is something wrong?

291
00:16:32,818 --> 00:16:35,585
You can't seat
Turot next to Hoex.

292
00:16:35,623 --> 00:16:37,684
They've been bitter rivals

293
00:16:37,728 --> 00:16:40,598
ever since Hoex bought out
Turot's controlling interest

294
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:43,434
in the cargo ports
on Volchok Prime.

295
00:16:43,472 --> 00:16:46,876
Rom! Change these seating
arrangements immediately.

296
00:16:46,912 --> 00:16:48,380
Quickly, you fool

297
00:16:48,415 --> 00:16:51,319
before I toss you
out the nearest airlock.

298
00:16:51,354 --> 00:16:52,822
I thought you understood

299
00:16:52,858 --> 00:16:54,623
this was to be
a private meeting.

300
00:16:54,661 --> 00:16:55,890
Yes.

301
00:16:57,801 --> 00:16:59,292
Go away!

302
00:16:59,337 --> 00:17:00,635
We're closed!

303
00:17:00,673 --> 00:17:02,700
Go away!

304
00:17:05,015 --> 00:17:07,315
Shoo! Shoo!

305
00:17:08,388 --> 00:17:10,085
What's the delay?

306
00:17:10,192 --> 00:17:12,094
We await the Grand Nagus.

307
00:17:12,129 --> 00:17:14,099
Well, he better show
his ears soon

308
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,260
or I'm leaving.

309
00:17:15,302 --> 00:17:16,931
No one leaves

310
00:17:16,972 --> 00:17:18,942
until the conference
has concluded.

311
00:17:18,976 --> 00:17:22,609
Still hiding
in your father's shadow?

312
00:17:22,651 --> 00:17:27,252
The Nagus casts
a very long shadow.

313
00:17:27,293 --> 00:17:29,821
Careful you don't
disappear in it!

314
00:17:29,865 --> 00:17:31,835
I see we're all here.

315
00:17:33,606 --> 00:17:35,074
Enough drinks.

316
00:17:35,108 --> 00:17:36,771
All right, I'm going.

317
00:17:36,812 --> 00:17:38,144
Quickly.

318
00:17:38,181 --> 00:17:41,517
No, you stay.

319
00:17:44,227 --> 00:17:45,856
Me?

320
00:17:48,736 --> 00:17:51,229
Gentlemen, be seated.

321
00:17:57,219 --> 00:17:59,655
Hey, Nog.

322
00:18:01,829 --> 00:18:03,799
Where were you this morning?

323
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,301
I'm through with school.

324
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:07,032
What do you mean through?

325
00:18:07,072 --> 00:18:10,603
I mean I don't have to attend
those boring classes anymore.

326
00:18:10,647 --> 00:18:12,138
Is this your father's idea?

327
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,152
It's the right decision.

328
00:18:14,253 --> 00:18:16,348
Look, if you want,
I'll talk to Mr. O'Brien.

329
00:18:16,391 --> 00:18:18,725
No.

330
00:18:18,763 --> 00:18:20,858
I don't belong there.

331
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,870
Don't you want to learn things?

332
00:18:22,904 --> 00:18:25,170
You mean like ethics?

333
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,768
Yeah, and other stuff.

334
00:18:26,812 --> 00:18:28,543
You don't understand.

335
00:18:28,581 --> 00:18:30,049
I'm a Ferengi.

336
00:18:30,085 --> 00:18:32,578
For me, school is
a waste of time.

337
00:18:32,624 --> 00:18:34,184
Why is that?

338
00:18:34,226 --> 00:18:36,389
Because there's no profit in it.

339
00:18:36,431 --> 00:18:37,831
So why are you
getting mad at me?

340
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:40,167
Because you're a stupid hu-man

341
00:18:40,205 --> 00:18:43,006
and I don't know
why I bother with you.

342
00:18:43,044 --> 00:18:44,205
I'm stupid?

343
00:18:44,313 --> 00:18:47,114
You're the one
not going to school.

344
00:18:47,152 --> 00:18:49,054
See if I care.

345
00:18:51,194 --> 00:18:54,189
And lastly, I would like
to salute Nava

346
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:57,433
whose takeover of the Arcybite
mining refineries

347
00:18:57,473 --> 00:19:00,240
in the Clarius System
is now complete.

348
00:19:00,312 --> 00:19:02,111
I congratulate you all.

349
00:19:02,149 --> 00:19:05,987
Profits are better than ever.

350
00:19:08,061 --> 00:19:11,796
Nevertheless, it is becoming
more and more difficult

351
00:19:11,835 --> 00:19:15,205
to find truly lucrative
business opportunities

352
00:19:15,242 --> 00:19:17,873
here in the Alpha Quadrant.

353
00:19:17,914 --> 00:19:19,679
And why?

354
00:19:19,718 --> 00:19:24,956
Because no matter where we go
our reputation precedes us...

355
00:19:24,995 --> 00:19:29,960
a reputation tainted
by the lies of our competitors

356
00:19:30,005 --> 00:19:33,068
who maliciously spread
the erroneous impression

357
00:19:33,111 --> 00:19:35,674
that we are not to be trusted.

358
00:19:39,523 --> 00:19:44,397
But now, thanks to the discovery
of the wormhole

359
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:50,139
for the first time, we can now
avoid such falsehoods.

360
00:19:50,178 --> 00:19:53,014
The Gamma Quadrant, gentlemen...

361
00:19:53,051 --> 00:19:57,116
millions of new worlds
at our very doorstep.

362
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:00,929
The potential
for Ferengi business expansion

363
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:03,837
is staggering.

364
00:20:03,873 --> 00:20:06,845
And best of all

365
00:20:06,879 --> 00:20:10,410
no one there has
ever heard the name Ferengi.

366
00:20:10,452 --> 00:20:13,652
Our reputation will be
absolutely stainless.

367
00:20:13,691 --> 00:20:16,322
Our word can be our bond.

368
00:20:16,397 --> 00:20:18,390
Until we decide to break it.

369
00:20:20,572 --> 00:20:27,246
It'll be the good old days
all over again.

370
00:20:27,286 --> 00:20:30,349
And who shall lead us
in this great endeavor?

371
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:31,517
Who else, but my father?

372
00:20:31,561 --> 00:20:32,756
The Nagus.

373
00:20:32,797 --> 00:20:34,323
The Grand Nagus!
Yes! Yes!

374
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:35,493
Nagus!

375
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:38,098
I thank you
for your confidence

376
00:20:38,141 --> 00:20:41,808
but I must decline the offer.

377
00:20:41,848 --> 00:20:43,111
But, Father...

378
00:20:43,151 --> 00:20:45,212
I'm old.

379
00:20:45,255 --> 00:20:46,952
The fire dims.

380
00:20:46,992 --> 00:20:50,955
I'm just not as greedy
as I used to be.

381
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,566
Yes, you are, more so.

382
00:20:52,698 --> 00:20:56,832
No, my mind's made up.

383
00:20:56,874 --> 00:21:00,439
I've already chosen
my successor.

384
00:21:00,481 --> 00:21:01,676
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

385
00:21:01,716 --> 00:21:02,843
Ahem.

386
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,286
A leader

387
00:21:04,322 --> 00:21:08,092
whose vision, imagination
and avarice

388
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:12,070
will oversee Ferengi ventures
in the Gamma Quadrant.

389
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:16,910
The new Grand Nagus...

390
00:21:18,383 --> 00:21:19,817
Quark!

391
00:21:23,828 --> 00:21:25,296
He's a lobeless amateur!

392
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:27,630
Father, have you
lost your mind?

393
00:21:27,668 --> 00:21:29,467
I won't stand for it!

394
00:21:29,505 --> 00:21:31,304
This is outrageous!

395
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:42,426
Congratulations.

396
00:21:42,465 --> 00:21:46,530
I know you'll do
a wonderful job.

397
00:22:15,631 --> 00:22:17,931
Oatmeal lumpy again?

398
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:20,303
No, I'm just not hungry.

399
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,638
Want to talk about it?

400
00:22:21,676 --> 00:22:23,543
It's Nog.

401
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,643
His father's pulled him
out of school.

402
00:22:26,686 --> 00:22:28,120
I see.

403
00:22:28,156 --> 00:22:29,647
It's not fair.

404
00:22:29,692 --> 00:22:31,889
Nog can't even read.

405
00:22:31,931 --> 00:22:34,903
School's not going
to be much fun without him.

406
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:38,171
You can still get together
with him after school.

407
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:42,048
Maybe. I don't think he wants
to be my friend anymore.

408
00:22:42,084 --> 00:22:43,279
Did he say why?

409
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,554
He says humans and Ferengis
don't get along.

410
00:22:46,593 --> 00:22:47,959
Usually they don't.

411
00:22:47,996 --> 00:22:49,795
But you're the one always saying

412
00:22:49,832 --> 00:22:52,599
that we should make friends
with other cultures.

413
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:55,474
I believe that, and I'm glad
you believe it, too

414
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,844
but human values
and Ferengi values

415
00:22:57,883 --> 00:22:59,181
are very different.

416
00:22:59,218 --> 00:23:01,688
We've never been able
to form a common bond.

417
00:23:01,723 --> 00:23:03,693
So Nog goes his way,
and I go mine.

418
00:23:03,727 --> 00:23:05,356
These things happen.

419
00:23:07,167 --> 00:23:11,005
Hey, how about after school,
we play a little baseball?

420
00:23:12,077 --> 00:23:13,910
I can't.

421
00:23:13,948 --> 00:23:16,350
I have something to do.

422
00:23:23,533 --> 00:23:24,831
Grand Nagus Quark.

423
00:23:24,902 --> 00:23:26,804
I love the sound of that.

424
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:30,209
I'm afraid we were never
formally introduced.

425
00:23:30,247 --> 00:23:32,775
I am Gral,
your new best friend.

426
00:23:32,818 --> 00:23:34,378
You wish to serve me?

427
00:23:34,422 --> 00:23:36,085
I wish to protect you.

428
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:37,856
Protect me?

429
00:23:37,895 --> 00:23:40,492
From those who are jealous
of your position

430
00:23:40,534 --> 00:23:42,629
and wish to take your place.

431
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,005
They can be very dangerous.

432
00:23:48,116 --> 00:23:50,313
How do I stop them?

433
00:23:50,354 --> 00:23:51,686
Leave it to me.

434
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:54,388
I'm not going to allow anybody

435
00:23:54,428 --> 00:23:58,368
to harm such a grateful friend
as yourself.

436
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:02,098
How grateful am I?

437
00:24:02,144 --> 00:24:05,241
Grateful enough to make sure
that I have my pick

438
00:24:05,283 --> 00:24:08,585
of the most lucrative
Gamma Quadrant opportunities.

439
00:24:08,623 --> 00:24:11,322
And if I refuse?

440
00:24:11,362 --> 00:24:13,855
You won't.

441
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:28,018
Nagus, I'm
in desperate trouble.

442
00:24:28,063 --> 00:24:31,433
So am l... and please,
call me Zek.

443
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:35,705
Now, which would you choose...
Risa or Balosnee VI?

444
00:24:35,744 --> 00:24:37,212
I don't quite follow.

445
00:24:37,247 --> 00:24:39,012
For my vacation.

446
00:24:39,051 --> 00:24:42,582
My first in 85 years.

447
00:24:42,624 --> 00:24:45,026
I'm told, on Balosnee

448
00:24:45,063 --> 00:24:47,295
the soothing harmonies
of the tides

449
00:24:47,334 --> 00:24:51,570
can cause the most
stimulating hallucinations

450
00:24:51,609 --> 00:24:56,881
but when I think of those
voluptuous Risian females...

451
00:24:56,919 --> 00:24:59,823
Nagus, please...

452
00:24:59,859 --> 00:25:01,624
Gral just threatened my life.

453
00:25:01,662 --> 00:25:04,293
So he's the first, is he?

454
00:25:04,335 --> 00:25:05,998
Well, he won't be the last.

455
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:07,598
But what am I to do?

456
00:25:07,641 --> 00:25:09,235
You picked me
for your successor.

457
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:10,872
Surely, you must have
some advice.

458
00:25:10,914 --> 00:25:13,613
To survive, you must
surround yourself

459
00:25:13,653 --> 00:25:15,144
with loyal men.

460
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,590
That's good.

461
00:25:16,626 --> 00:25:17,753
But not too loyal.

462
00:25:17,794 --> 00:25:21,096
Never trust anyone
who places your prosperity

463
00:25:21,135 --> 00:25:22,262
above their own.

464
00:25:22,304 --> 00:25:23,329
I see.

465
00:25:23,373 --> 00:25:25,741
And remember, when in doubt,
be ruthless.

466
00:25:25,777 --> 00:25:30,947
Yes. I can do that.

467
00:25:31,021 --> 00:25:32,718
Go on.

468
00:25:34,094 --> 00:25:35,757
Zek?

469
00:25:37,134 --> 00:25:38,728
Zek?!

470
00:25:51,729 --> 00:25:54,496
I didn't do anything.

471
00:25:59,345 --> 00:26:02,215
I don't know, Krax.

472
00:26:03,453 --> 00:26:06,391
20 bars of gold-pressed latinum?

473
00:26:06,425 --> 00:26:10,729
Uh... I'll need
to think about it.

474
00:26:10,767 --> 00:26:12,258
In a year, it'll be
worth twice as much.

475
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:14,331
All right, I'll take it.

476
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:17,313
You want me to be
your bodyguard?

477
00:26:17,347 --> 00:26:19,817
Think of it as a promotion.

478
00:26:19,852 --> 00:26:20,945
But why me?

479
00:26:20,987 --> 00:26:24,221
You're the only one left
I can trust.

480
00:26:24,261 --> 00:26:26,926
You're my closest associate.

481
00:26:26,966 --> 00:26:28,959
My friend, my brother.

482
00:26:29,003 --> 00:26:30,471
But I thought...

483
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:34,174
since you'll be so busy
being Grand Nagus

484
00:26:34,214 --> 00:26:37,311
I could take over
running the bar.

485
00:26:41,329 --> 00:26:43,299
You... run my bar?

486
00:26:52,784 --> 00:26:55,483
Not exactly overcome by grief,
are we?

487
00:26:55,523 --> 00:26:57,823
This is
a private funeral service.

488
00:26:57,861 --> 00:27:00,697
Hmm. You have my sympathies
for your loss.

489
00:27:00,734 --> 00:27:03,831
Nevertheless, when someone
dies on my station

490
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:07,813
there are questions
that must be answered.

491
00:27:07,848 --> 00:27:10,411
There was nothing suspicious
about my father's death.

492
00:27:10,453 --> 00:27:12,184
It was caused
by a massive infection

493
00:27:12,224 --> 00:27:13,453
of the tympanic membrane...

494
00:27:13,493 --> 00:27:14,791
a chronic condition.

495
00:27:14,828 --> 00:27:16,457
Then I hope you won't mind

496
00:27:16,499 --> 00:27:19,835
if I ask Dr. Bashir
to examine the body.

497
00:27:21,175 --> 00:27:23,168
That would be difficult.

498
00:27:23,212 --> 00:27:24,578
What's this?

499
00:27:24,615 --> 00:27:25,776
My piece of Zek.

500
00:27:25,817 --> 00:27:28,185
You see, when a Ferengi
of my father's stature dies

501
00:27:28,222 --> 00:27:30,853
the body is automatically
vacuum-desiccated

502
00:27:30,894 --> 00:27:32,812
and sold
as a prized collectible.

503
00:27:34,649 --> 00:27:36,083
How touching.

504
00:27:53,019 --> 00:27:55,512
- I know there's...
- I wonder...

505
00:27:55,557 --> 00:27:56,684
Go ahead.

506
00:27:56,726 --> 00:27:58,058
It wasn't important.

507
00:27:58,095 --> 00:28:02,058
I guess humans and Ferengis
don't have a lot to talk about.

508
00:28:02,103 --> 00:28:03,902
That's what my father says.

509
00:28:04,007 --> 00:28:05,202
Mine, too.

510
00:28:05,244 --> 00:28:07,772
That doesn't mean they're right.

511
00:28:07,815 --> 00:28:11,083
We always had stuff
to talk about before.

512
00:28:11,121 --> 00:28:13,182
So, what do you say...

513
00:28:13,226 --> 00:28:15,891
you still want to be friends?

514
00:28:18,236 --> 00:28:19,568
Yes.

515
00:28:22,478 --> 00:28:26,077
When my father finds out,
he won't be happy.

516
00:28:26,118 --> 00:28:27,712
Neither will mine.

517
00:28:27,755 --> 00:28:31,057
Come on, I have a great idea.

518
00:28:31,095 --> 00:28:32,427
What is it?

519
00:28:32,465 --> 00:28:34,162
Come on.

520
00:28:34,201 --> 00:28:39,542
So, what exactly does it mean
becoming Grand Nagus?

521
00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:42,483
It means that, from now on,
if you wish to speak to me

522
00:28:42,518 --> 00:28:44,750
you must first make
an appointment with Rom.

523
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:46,349
Don't be ludicrous.

524
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:48,556
It is also customary
to show respect

525
00:28:48,597 --> 00:28:52,162
by kissing my scepter.

526
00:28:57,848 --> 00:29:02,084
I suppose I could make
an exception in your case.

527
00:29:20,861 --> 00:29:23,331
You see the discoloration
around the impact perimeter?

528
00:29:23,366 --> 00:29:26,429
These are sorium
and argine traces.

529
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,999
Aren't they Ferengi explosives?

530
00:29:28,075 --> 00:29:30,706
Exactly. What we have here
is a Ferengi locator bomb

531
00:29:30,747 --> 00:29:33,013
designed to lock on
to a target's pheromones.

532
00:29:33,085 --> 00:29:34,884
You mean they're
attracted to body odor?

533
00:29:34,922 --> 00:29:37,450
Mm-hmm. Very deadly
and very accurate.

534
00:29:37,495 --> 00:29:39,931
If Quark hadn't lowered
his head at the last second...

535
00:29:39,966 --> 00:29:41,799
- Commander.
- Yes, Doctor?

536
00:29:41,836 --> 00:29:44,033
I've just given Quark
a thorough examination.

537
00:29:44,107 --> 00:29:45,804
He's a bit shaken
up, nothing more.

538
00:29:45,844 --> 00:29:48,611
I guess it's time
to have a little chat

539
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,210
with the Grand Nagus.

540
00:29:50,253 --> 00:29:51,847
I'd be delighted.

541
00:30:01,809 --> 00:30:04,075
When are you
going to get it through

542
00:30:04,181 --> 00:30:05,946
your twisted
little brain that we

543
00:30:05,984 --> 00:30:07,977
are trying to save your life?

544
00:30:08,022 --> 00:30:10,254
You're trying to interfere
in Ferengi affairs of state.

545
00:30:10,293 --> 00:30:11,591
Which are none of your concern.

546
00:30:11,629 --> 00:30:13,326
Now, look here, Quark...

547
00:30:13,366 --> 00:30:16,497
Uh-uh-uh... Grand Nagus Quark.

548
00:30:16,539 --> 00:30:19,511
Those locator bombs
are damn near foolproof.

549
00:30:19,545 --> 00:30:20,706
You were lucky once.

550
00:30:20,747 --> 00:30:22,717
Next time, we could be
scraping you off the walls.

551
00:30:22,751 --> 00:30:26,019
The Grand Nagus does not ask
for help from outsiders.

552
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:29,030
I'm sure whoever tried to kill
you is counting on that.

553
00:30:29,064 --> 00:30:30,795
You must have some suspicion
who that could be.

554
00:30:30,834 --> 00:30:32,268
I'm suspicious of everybody.

555
00:30:32,303 --> 00:30:33,430
But who would you say

556
00:30:33,473 --> 00:30:35,841
stands to benefit
the most from your death?

557
00:30:35,877 --> 00:30:38,006
Let's see.

558
00:30:38,048 --> 00:30:39,813
That would have to be Krax.

559
00:30:39,852 --> 00:30:41,583
Yes, if anything
were to happen to me

560
00:30:41,623 --> 00:30:42,989
Krax becomes Nagus.

561
00:30:43,025 --> 00:30:45,724
True, but let's not forget that
it was Gral who threatened you.

562
00:30:46,866 --> 00:30:48,164
Threatened you?

563
00:30:48,202 --> 00:30:49,261
How?

564
00:30:49,304 --> 00:30:51,297
That's none of your concern.

565
00:30:51,341 --> 00:30:54,472
Besides, Gral and Krax
were at the funeral

566
00:30:54,515 --> 00:30:56,485
when the bomb went off

567
00:30:56,519 --> 00:31:00,823
which means that neither one
of them could have set it.

568
00:31:00,861 --> 00:31:03,833
Whoever planned this could
have had an accomplice.

569
00:31:03,867 --> 00:31:07,568
You're sure all of Zek's
associates attended the funeral?

570
00:31:07,608 --> 00:31:09,475
Yes, yes, they were all there.

571
00:31:09,512 --> 00:31:11,106
Look, this is getting us
nowhere.

572
00:31:11,148 --> 00:31:12,708
What about Zek's servant?

573
00:31:12,751 --> 00:31:14,117
You mean Maihar'du?

574
00:31:14,154 --> 00:31:15,452
What about him?

575
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:17,050
Was he at the funeral?

576
00:31:17,093 --> 00:31:18,995
I don't recall
seeing him there.

577
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:19,998
Do you?

578
00:31:20,032 --> 00:31:21,934
Now that you mention it...

579
00:31:21,969 --> 00:31:23,301
no, I don't.

580
00:31:24,975 --> 00:31:26,341
Interesting.

581
00:31:26,378 --> 00:31:28,348
Hupyrian servants are renowned

582
00:31:28,382 --> 00:31:30,818
for their devotion
to their employers.

583
00:31:30,854 --> 00:31:33,758
For Maihar'du
not to have shown up

584
00:31:33,793 --> 00:31:36,731
at Zek's funeral
is very odd indeed.

585
00:31:45,282 --> 00:31:48,049
You were out pretty
late last night.

586
00:31:48,088 --> 00:31:49,454
I was?

587
00:31:49,492 --> 00:31:51,462
You came in after midnight.

588
00:31:51,496 --> 00:31:54,662
Uh... I guess I got
kind of busy doing stuff.

589
00:31:54,702 --> 00:31:56,228
What kind of stuff?

590
00:31:56,304 --> 00:31:58,240
Nothing important,
just hanging around.

591
00:31:58,308 --> 00:31:59,606
With Nog.

592
00:31:59,645 --> 00:32:01,615
We weren't doing anything wrong.

593
00:32:01,649 --> 00:32:03,676
Good. Then you can
tell me all about it.

594
00:32:07,961 --> 00:32:08,951
I can't.

595
00:32:08,997 --> 00:32:10,295
It's private.

596
00:32:10,332 --> 00:32:12,734
Private?

597
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:17,372
I got to go,
or I'll be late for school.

598
00:32:17,413 --> 00:32:19,076
I want you home
in time for dinner.

599
00:32:19,117 --> 00:32:20,107
Understood?

600
00:32:22,825 --> 00:32:24,225
Understood.

601
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:34,437
The thing is, uh... Nagus

602
00:32:34,482 --> 00:32:40,393
I feel I've done all I can
in the field of gouge mining.

603
00:32:40,426 --> 00:32:42,828
You wish to find profit
elsewhere?

604
00:32:42,865 --> 00:32:44,163
Yes, Nagus.

605
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,831
Where would that be?

606
00:32:46,873 --> 00:32:49,436
I'd like the chance

607
00:32:49,478 --> 00:32:53,612
to introduce synthehol
to the Gamma Quadrant.

608
00:32:53,653 --> 00:32:59,291
A very lucrative opportunity.

609
00:33:01,434 --> 00:33:02,766
Tell me, Nava

610
00:33:02,804 --> 00:33:06,072
when Zek announced
I was to succeed him

611
00:33:06,111 --> 00:33:07,477
were you pleased?

612
00:33:07,514 --> 00:33:12,354
Uh... no, Nagus.

613
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,296
Did you come to me
and offer your support?

614
00:33:19,838 --> 00:33:21,967
No, Nagus.

615
00:33:23,746 --> 00:33:26,046
Yet now you call me Nagus

616
00:33:26,084 --> 00:33:29,056
but is it
out of true friendship?

617
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:33,053
No, you only pretend
to show me respect

618
00:33:33,098 --> 00:33:36,799
so I will grant you
this immense opportunity.

619
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:39,834
Which I'm willing
to split with you... 50-50?

620
00:33:39,878 --> 00:33:41,848
Well, in that case

621
00:33:41,882 --> 00:33:44,877
let's hope the Gamma Quadrant
develops a taste for synthehol.

622
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:48,186
Oh, yes.

623
00:33:51,468 --> 00:33:53,802
A very smart deal, Nagus.

624
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,244
I seem to have
a knack for it, don't I?

625
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:58,645
Yes, Nagus.

626
00:33:58,683 --> 00:34:01,849
The rest will have
to come back tomorrow.

627
00:34:01,889 --> 00:34:04,121
All this benevolence wearies me.

628
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,526
Yes, Nagus.

629
00:34:05,563 --> 00:34:07,123
As you wish, Nagus.

630
00:34:07,166 --> 00:34:09,933
I think
I'll head over to the bar

631
00:34:09,972 --> 00:34:11,304
and check the receipts.

632
00:34:11,374 --> 00:34:12,774
- Yes, Nagus.
- Yes, Nagus.

633
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:22,557
If he keeps handing out
these choice opportunities

634
00:34:22,597 --> 00:34:26,230
he's going to become
very popular.

635
00:34:26,271 --> 00:34:30,041
We'll just have to come up
with a new plan.

636
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:34,247
Something more reliable
than a locator bomb.

637
00:34:34,287 --> 00:34:37,316
Something that
can't possibly fail

638
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:40,126
to kill my dear brother.

639
00:34:51,383 --> 00:34:52,943
Come in.

640
00:34:55,224 --> 00:34:57,023
I was going to ask you

641
00:34:57,062 --> 00:34:58,861
to join me in a round
of Jokarian chess

642
00:34:58,899 --> 00:35:01,427
but I can see you're just
sitting down to dinner.

643
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,768
I sat down half an hour ago

644
00:35:02,807 --> 00:35:05,039
about the time Jake
was supposed to be home.

645
00:35:05,078 --> 00:35:07,845
Aubergine stew.

646
00:35:07,883 --> 00:35:09,614
Looks delicious.

647
00:35:09,654 --> 00:35:11,317
So, where's Jake?

648
00:35:11,357 --> 00:35:12,518
Where else?

649
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:14,050
With Nog.

650
00:35:14,096 --> 00:35:17,091
Going through my own adolescence
was difficult enough.

651
00:35:17,135 --> 00:35:19,401
Surviving my son's
is going to take a miracle.

652
00:35:19,439 --> 00:35:22,673
Maybe it's time you had
a little talk with Jake.

653
00:35:22,713 --> 00:35:25,276
Children need to know
their boundaries.

654
00:35:25,318 --> 00:35:26,616
I should know.

655
00:35:26,654 --> 00:35:28,647
I've been a mother three times
and a father twice.

656
00:35:28,692 --> 00:35:30,389
Which was easier?

657
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:33,923
Actually, I wasn't
very successful either way

658
00:35:33,969 --> 00:35:37,773
so... feel free to reject
what I'm about to say

659
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:40,212
but if I were you,
I would go find Jake

660
00:35:40,314 --> 00:35:42,807
and bring him here
to eat his dinner.

661
00:35:42,853 --> 00:35:44,789
You would?

662
00:35:44,824 --> 00:35:46,555
Absolutely.

663
00:35:50,936 --> 00:35:53,236
Computer, locate Jake Sisko.

664
00:35:53,307 --> 00:35:56,473
Jake Sisko is in Cargo Bay 14.

665
00:35:57,783 --> 00:35:59,719
Thanks, old man.

666
00:36:10,174 --> 00:36:13,010
...are four...
teen, fourteen...

667
00:36:13,047 --> 00:36:14,015
"Planets..."

668
00:36:14,049 --> 00:36:20,085
"...planets
in the Bajoran s..."

669
00:36:20,128 --> 00:36:22,598
What's that word?

670
00:36:22,632 --> 00:36:24,898
"System."

671
00:36:24,937 --> 00:36:26,600
"System."

672
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,405
That was pretty good.

673
00:36:28,444 --> 00:36:30,972
Want to try some more?

674
00:36:31,016 --> 00:36:33,077
"The lar...

675
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:38,586
"largest planet is Bajor.

676
00:36:38,631 --> 00:36:42,901
"It has... three...

677
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,238
moons?"

678
00:36:44,276 --> 00:36:45,608
You got it!

679
00:36:47,115 --> 00:36:48,846
Keep going, keep going.

680
00:36:48,885 --> 00:36:51,185
Okay.

681
00:36:51,223 --> 00:36:54,218
"The third... moon...

682
00:36:54,262 --> 00:36:55,730
it has..."

683
00:36:57,268 --> 00:36:58,566
You clumsy idiot.

684
00:36:58,604 --> 00:37:00,233
You want to strangle me?

685
00:37:00,274 --> 00:37:01,572
My apologies, Nagus.

686
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:02,737
Stop daydreaming.

687
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,579
Pay attention to your work.

688
00:37:04,616 --> 00:37:05,914
Yes, Nagus.

689
00:37:05,953 --> 00:37:07,251
When do we leave?

690
00:37:07,288 --> 00:37:09,588
Just as soon
as you're ready, Nagus.

691
00:37:09,626 --> 00:37:11,755
I've always wanted
to take a trip

692
00:37:11,798 --> 00:37:13,232
through the wormhole.

693
00:37:13,267 --> 00:37:14,496
Still, it's odd...

694
00:37:14,536 --> 00:37:15,834
Zek never mentioned

695
00:37:15,872 --> 00:37:18,274
that he'd traveled
to the Gamma Quadrant

696
00:37:18,377 --> 00:37:21,144
let alone opened negotiations
with one of its worlds.

697
00:37:21,183 --> 00:37:23,814
Negotiations that you will have
the honor of completing.

698
00:37:23,855 --> 00:37:25,016
According to Krax

699
00:37:25,057 --> 00:37:28,223
Stakoron II contains
rich deposits of mizainite ore.

700
00:37:28,264 --> 00:37:30,564
A very lucrative opportunity.

701
00:37:30,601 --> 00:37:32,298
Quark?

702
00:37:32,372 --> 00:37:34,638
What now?

703
00:37:34,676 --> 00:37:37,273
About the bar...

704
00:37:37,315 --> 00:37:41,255
you have so much,
and I have so little...

705
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:44,785
Which is exactly
how it was meant to be.

706
00:37:46,633 --> 00:37:48,101
Come.

707
00:37:48,137 --> 00:37:51,473
Let's not keep
our new partners waiting.

708
00:38:06,908 --> 00:38:10,609
May I say, Nagus,
that my father himself

709
00:38:10,648 --> 00:38:12,618
never looked more commanding.

710
00:38:12,652 --> 00:38:13,950
I've been thinking

711
00:38:13,988 --> 00:38:15,456
maybe it would be wise

712
00:38:15,491 --> 00:38:17,791
to take a dabo girl along
with us.

713
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:19,128
Whatever for?

714
00:38:19,165 --> 00:38:23,128
A pretty woman by my side
would only add to my prestige.

715
00:38:23,173 --> 00:38:24,471
Never underestimate

716
00:38:24,509 --> 00:38:26,979
the importance
of a first impression.

717
00:38:27,014 --> 00:38:29,314
One look
at your imposing features

718
00:38:29,352 --> 00:38:31,322
and the Stakoron negotiators

719
00:38:31,356 --> 00:38:35,319
will give us
everything we ask for.

720
00:38:35,364 --> 00:38:37,357
All right.

721
00:38:37,402 --> 00:38:40,306
If you really think
I won't need her...

722
00:38:40,341 --> 00:38:42,470
Believe me, you won't.

723
00:38:42,512 --> 00:38:44,175
Shall we?

724
00:39:16,914 --> 00:39:20,409
This is an historic moment.

725
00:39:22,758 --> 00:39:24,421
Nagus.

726
00:39:29,772 --> 00:39:32,106
There must be some mistake.

727
00:39:33,614 --> 00:39:36,916
There's no ship docked here.

728
00:39:36,954 --> 00:39:39,517
Wait!

729
00:39:39,559 --> 00:39:41,529
Rom, you idiot!

730
00:39:41,563 --> 00:39:45,435
Krax, what are you
standing there for?

731
00:39:45,504 --> 00:39:49,376
What's the matter with you two?

732
00:39:49,412 --> 00:39:51,541
Open the door!

733
00:39:51,583 --> 00:39:54,316
Do you hear me?!

734
00:39:54,355 --> 00:39:55,846
Open up!

735
00:39:57,996 --> 00:40:00,559
You must obey your Nagus!

736
00:40:00,601 --> 00:40:03,698
Sorry, Quark, but you've just
been voted out of office.

737
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:04,107
Rom!

738
00:40:04,108 --> 00:40:05,907
Rom!

739
00:40:05,946 --> 00:40:07,848
Brother!

740
00:40:07,882 --> 00:40:09,613
Please!

741
00:40:09,652 --> 00:40:14,185
So, you were going
to toss me out an airlock.

742
00:40:14,228 --> 00:40:16,927
I never meant it.

743
00:40:16,968 --> 00:40:18,436
Well, I do.

744
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:20,269
"Rom's."

745
00:40:20,307 --> 00:40:23,040
Nice name for a bar,
don't you think?

746
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,378
Enough talk.

747
00:40:24,415 --> 00:40:26,009
Let's get this started.

748
00:40:26,052 --> 00:40:28,352
Would you like
to do the honors?

749
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:30,223
Or should I?

750
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,889
Let me out!

751
00:40:35,571 --> 00:40:38,338
Let me out of here!

752
00:40:40,614 --> 00:40:42,413
Please...

753
00:40:43,654 --> 00:40:44,747
Release him!

754
00:40:46,192 --> 00:40:47,490
Nagus!

755
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,327
- You're alive!
- You're alive!

756
00:40:52,538 --> 00:40:54,508
Well, Quark

757
00:40:54,542 --> 00:40:57,514
looks like you needed
my help after all.

758
00:40:57,548 --> 00:41:00,018
Don't you recognize your father?

759
00:41:00,054 --> 00:41:01,648
You died.

760
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:03,626
I saw it happen.

761
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:06,096
You saw me enter
a Dolbargy sleeping trance.

762
00:41:06,132 --> 00:41:07,532
Maihar'du taught it to me.

763
00:41:07,635 --> 00:41:08,762
But why, Father?

764
00:41:08,804 --> 00:41:10,295
It was a test

765
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:13,905
to see if you were
ready to take my place

766
00:41:13,947 --> 00:41:16,942
and you failed... miserably!

767
00:41:18,522 --> 00:41:20,685
But, Father, I am ready.

768
00:41:20,726 --> 00:41:22,662
I am ready.

769
00:41:22,697 --> 00:41:24,257
You saw for yourself

770
00:41:24,301 --> 00:41:26,032
I was about to grab power!

771
00:41:26,104 --> 00:41:27,664
You don't grab power.

772
00:41:27,707 --> 00:41:31,272
You accumulate it quietly
without anyone noticing.

773
00:41:31,315 --> 00:41:32,944
But I don't understand.

774
00:41:32,984 --> 00:41:34,613
The bar, you fool.

775
00:41:34,654 --> 00:41:36,054
That was the key.

776
00:41:36,091 --> 00:41:37,720
All those visitors stopping by

777
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,323
on their way
to and from the wormhole.

778
00:41:40,366 --> 00:41:43,338
You could have sat there quietly
at your leisure

779
00:41:43,372 --> 00:41:46,003
and gathered up
all the information you needed

780
00:41:46,044 --> 00:41:47,342
about the Gamma Quadrant.

781
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,507
What about him?

782
00:41:48,549 --> 00:41:51,180
Oh, you could have let him
hold the scepter

783
00:41:51,221 --> 00:41:53,521
while you controlled everything
from the shadows.

784
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:55,688
And then, when everything
was running smoothly

785
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:57,859
only then would you take over.

786
00:41:57,901 --> 00:41:59,199
But, Father...

787
00:41:59,237 --> 00:42:01,230
No! I'm not interested
in excuses!

788
00:42:01,275 --> 00:42:02,869
Go back to the ship.

789
00:42:02,911 --> 00:42:05,040
We'll be leaving here shortly.

790
00:42:05,082 --> 00:42:06,550
Yes, Father.

791
00:42:06,585 --> 00:42:08,053
It's like...

792
00:42:08,088 --> 00:42:10,889
it's like talking to a Klingon.

793
00:42:15,436 --> 00:42:18,772
I guess this
still belongs to you.

794
00:42:18,809 --> 00:42:20,277
Yes.

795
00:42:20,313 --> 00:42:23,513
It looks like I'll have
to remain Grand Nagus

796
00:42:23,552 --> 00:42:26,752
long enough to establish
a Ferengi presence

797
00:42:26,792 --> 00:42:28,260
in the Gamma Quadrant.

798
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:32,258
And I was really looking
forward to retirement.

799
00:42:32,303 --> 00:42:35,104
If I hear of any good
Gamma Quadrant deals

800
00:42:35,142 --> 00:42:37,612
you'd be right for,
I'll let you know.

801
00:42:37,647 --> 00:42:39,378
You know where to find me.

802
00:42:39,417 --> 00:42:41,945
You've done a very
profitable job

803
00:42:41,989 --> 00:42:43,457
with this place.

804
00:42:43,492 --> 00:42:45,962
Who knows, maybe one day

805
00:42:45,997 --> 00:42:48,833
I'll come back
and buy it from you.

806
00:42:56,184 --> 00:42:57,813
So, Rom...

807
00:42:57,854 --> 00:43:00,951
you were going to toss
me out an airlock.

808
00:43:02,697 --> 00:43:04,326
Forgive me, brother.

809
00:43:04,367 --> 00:43:05,665
Forgive you?!

810
00:43:05,703 --> 00:43:07,332
Why, brother...

811
00:43:07,373 --> 00:43:11,074
I didn't think
you had the lobes.

812
00:43:11,114 --> 00:43:14,450
Such wonderful treachery
deserves a reward.

813
00:43:14,487 --> 00:43:16,047
I'm going to make you
the assistant manager

814
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:18,322
of policy and clientele
here at Quark's.

815
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:20,594
What exactly does that mean?

816
00:43:20,633 --> 00:43:22,124
How should I know?

817
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:23,638
I just made it up.

818
00:43:23,672 --> 00:43:26,006
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

819
00:43:27,113 --> 00:43:29,413
So what time tomorrow?

820
00:43:29,451 --> 00:43:32,446
How about as soon
as you get out of school?

821
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,159
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

822
00:43:44,314 --> 00:43:45,977
Jake.

823
00:43:48,155 --> 00:43:49,646
Dad.

824
00:43:51,428 --> 00:43:53,398
What are you doing here?

825
00:43:53,432 --> 00:43:56,097
I was waiting for you.

826
00:44:03,185 --> 00:44:04,814
Dad...

827
00:44:04,854 --> 00:44:07,849
You're a great boy,
you know that?

828
00:44:10,031 --> 00:44:12,867
Now go be with your friend.
