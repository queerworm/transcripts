1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,095
Last time on <i>Star Trek:</i>
<i>Deep Space Nine...</i>

2
00:00:04,135 --> 00:00:05,297
I think I know what happened

3
00:00:05,337 --> 00:00:06,806
to Commander Sisko
and the others.

4
00:00:06,842 --> 00:00:09,143
The transporter beam was
redirected as it passed

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,014
through the polarized particles.

6
00:00:11,051 --> 00:00:13,079
Redirected where?

7
00:00:13,123 --> 00:00:13,954
Not where... when.

8
00:00:13,992 --> 00:00:15,427
You ever hear of the Bell Riots?

9
00:00:15,462 --> 00:00:17,433
It is one of the most violent

10
00:00:17,466 --> 00:00:19,197
civil disturbances
in American history

11
00:00:19,238 --> 00:00:21,368
and it happened right here...
San Francisco

12
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:22,811
Sanctuary District "A"

13
00:00:22,846 --> 00:00:24,908
the first week of September,
2024.

14
00:00:24,951 --> 00:00:27,218
But that's only a few days
from now.

15
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:28,691
The riots will be

16
00:00:28,727 --> 00:00:31,894
one of the watershed events
of the 21st century.

17
00:00:31,935 --> 00:00:33,963
Gabriel Bell will see to that.

18
00:00:34,007 --> 00:00:36,001
I still haven't
found my friends.

19
00:00:36,044 --> 00:00:38,538
And you think they might be
in a Sanctuary District?

20
00:00:38,584 --> 00:00:39,678
It's possible.

21
00:00:39,721 --> 00:00:41,749
If you hadn't found me,
I might have wound up in one.

22
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,659
This place is about to explode.

23
00:00:43,696 --> 00:00:46,726
Most of us agreed to live here
because they promised us jobs.

24
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:47,932
I don't know about you

25
00:00:47,973 --> 00:00:50,444
but I haven't been on
any job interviews lately.

26
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,216
That man who just got killed
trying to help us...

27
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:57,696
that man was Gabriel Bell.

28
00:01:01,806 --> 00:01:04,506
Give me that!
Get back!

29
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:06,677
Get away!
Get away from him!

30
00:01:06,718 --> 00:01:08,347
Come on, we have to get him
off the street!

31
00:01:08,389 --> 00:01:11,556
I've waited a long time
for this.

32
00:01:13,401 --> 00:01:16,431
And I know I won't
be disappointed.

33
00:01:16,475 --> 00:01:17,967
Ain't that right, new boy?

34
00:01:18,012 --> 00:01:20,483
The name is Bell.

35
00:01:21,887 --> 00:01:23,652
Gabriel Bell.

36
00:01:25,062 --> 00:01:27,260
And now, the conclusion.

37
00:01:29,272 --> 00:01:31,436
Hey! What are you looking at?

38
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:33,415
Nothing.

39
00:01:33,449 --> 00:01:35,647
If you're trying
to find a way out

40
00:01:35,688 --> 00:01:37,453
forget it... Bernardo.

41
00:01:37,492 --> 00:01:39,257
You ain't going anywhere.

42
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:43,606
None of you are.

43
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,941
What are you going
to do with us?

44
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:48,781
I was going to let you
think about that

45
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:50,619
for a little bit.

46
00:01:50,657 --> 00:01:53,128
Now, everybody,
against the wall!

47
00:01:53,162 --> 00:01:54,791
Sit down over there.

48
00:01:54,834 --> 00:01:56,828
Move! Move it!

49
00:01:56,871 --> 00:02:00,243
If any of them moves,
shoot them.

50
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,444
No one's shooting anyone.

51
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,187
Maybe... maybe not.

52
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,220
We need them alive.

53
00:02:08,265 --> 00:02:10,759
They're the only thing
we have to bargain with.

54
00:02:10,805 --> 00:02:12,297
You think I didn't know that?

55
00:02:12,342 --> 00:02:13,743
Just making sure.

56
00:02:13,779 --> 00:02:15,773
We need to get
these blinds closed.

57
00:02:15,817 --> 00:02:17,480
Police will drop
snipers on the roofs

58
00:02:17,521 --> 00:02:19,651
across the street,
and pick us off one by one.

59
00:02:19,693 --> 00:02:21,994
All right. Let's use
the benches as barricades.

60
00:02:22,032 --> 00:02:24,026
We'll stack them up
against the windows.

61
00:02:31,053 --> 00:02:32,682
It's too bad.

62
00:02:32,725 --> 00:02:35,391
I kind of like watching
this place burn.

63
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,922
Drop your weapons!

64
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:41,410
What's so funny?

65
00:02:41,512 --> 00:02:42,674
You.

66
00:02:42,714 --> 00:02:43,978
You're dead.

67
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:48,256
Shut up!

68
00:02:49,364 --> 00:02:50,332
That's enough!

69
00:02:50,366 --> 00:02:51,596
I said shut up!

70
00:02:51,636 --> 00:02:52,866
Leave her alone!

71
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,535
She's just scared.

72
00:02:54,576 --> 00:02:56,706
Listen, calm down.

73
00:02:56,748 --> 00:02:58,742
No one's going to hurt you.

74
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:04,964
Get over there with the others.

75
00:03:05,002 --> 00:03:06,232
I know you.

76
00:03:06,271 --> 00:03:08,765
I picked you up the other day.

77
00:03:08,811 --> 00:03:11,613
I know.
It's my way of saying thank you.

78
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:12,710
Get over there with the others!

79
00:03:12,753 --> 00:03:15,088
Hey, nice tackle, Bell.

80
00:03:15,126 --> 00:03:17,120
You ever play any football?

81
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:18,690
Baseball, actually.

82
00:03:18,735 --> 00:03:19,863
Really?

83
00:03:19,903 --> 00:03:21,202
I'd hate to be a catcher

84
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,268
and see you barreling
towards home plate.

85
00:03:24,648 --> 00:03:26,676
Hey, you, get up.

86
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,714
Leave her alone.

87
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:30,285
Oh, nice mouth.

88
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:33,029
All right, you get up.

89
00:03:34,873 --> 00:03:37,003
I said, get up!

90
00:03:37,044 --> 00:03:38,844
What are you doing?

91
00:03:38,883 --> 00:03:39,908
Relax, I just want to see

92
00:03:39,952 --> 00:03:41,581
what they're saying
about us on the Net.

93
00:03:41,623 --> 00:03:42,956
I need his access code
to log on.

94
00:03:44,897 --> 00:03:46,800
Don't make me ask you again.

95
00:03:46,835 --> 00:03:48,999
Get lost.

96
00:03:50,143 --> 00:03:51,510
After you.

97
00:03:51,547 --> 00:03:53,518
Wait. I'll do it.

98
00:03:53,618 --> 00:03:54,917
What are you doing?
Sit down.

99
00:03:54,954 --> 00:03:58,451
Hey, Vin, we're not on duty now,
so don't give me orders.

100
00:04:02,272 --> 00:04:04,904
I just want to make it home
in one piece.

101
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:06,916
Smart boy.

102
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,921
Move.
Get back there.

103
00:04:18,812 --> 00:04:20,874
I know what you're thinking.

104
00:04:20,917 --> 00:04:24,289
It's not going to be easy
keeping the hostages safe.

105
00:04:24,325 --> 00:04:27,492
It's not just them
I'm worried about.

106
00:04:27,532 --> 00:04:29,092
It's you.

107
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:31,369
Didn't you say Gabriel Bell died
when the police

108
00:04:31,408 --> 00:04:32,877
stormed the building?

109
00:04:32,913 --> 00:04:34,542
Right, but I'm not Bell.

110
00:04:34,616 --> 00:04:38,956
No, but we're the only
ones who know that.

111
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:44,773
...Governor Chen has issued
a statement saying

112
00:06:44,809 --> 00:06:47,577
the uprising will be quelled
and the district secured.

113
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,951
It's still not clear
how this riot began

114
00:06:49,988 --> 00:06:52,186
though rumors of mounting
tensions have been filtering

115
00:06:52,226 --> 00:06:53,855
out of the District
for weeks...

116
00:06:53,898 --> 00:06:55,698
This is great.
We're on every channel.

117
00:06:55,735 --> 00:06:59,871
I bet they're watching this
in China.

118
00:06:59,912 --> 00:07:01,040
Why do they sound so surprised?

119
00:07:01,081 --> 00:07:02,641
I mean, when you treat people
like animals

120
00:07:02,685 --> 00:07:03,653
you're going to get bit.

121
00:07:03,687 --> 00:07:04,655
Hey, hold, hold it!

122
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,658
Let me through.

123
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:06,854
Stop right there.

124
00:07:06,895 --> 00:07:08,057
Hey!

125
00:07:08,097 --> 00:07:09,259
Who said you
could come in here?

126
00:07:09,334 --> 00:07:10,462
It's okay, let him in.

127
00:07:10,504 --> 00:07:11,472
You know this gimme?

128
00:07:11,506 --> 00:07:13,169
He's a friend.

129
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:16,316
Go join your friends.

130
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,288
...20-block area
containing some 10,000...

131
00:07:20,361 --> 00:07:22,491
Glad to see you're all right.

132
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:25,301
So much for our peaceful
demonstration.

133
00:07:25,373 --> 00:07:27,810
I know it's not
what we talked about

134
00:07:27,845 --> 00:07:29,542
but it's what happened

135
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,679
and now we have to deal with it.

136
00:07:31,722 --> 00:07:33,920
How?
It's a madhouse out there

137
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,626
and this building is
crawling with ghosts.

138
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:37,634
I know.

139
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:39,469
That's the first thing
we have to fix.

140
00:07:39,506 --> 00:07:42,000
I want you to go out and find
gimmes... people you know

141
00:07:42,046 --> 00:07:44,313
people who can be trusted
to guard the hostages.

142
00:07:44,351 --> 00:07:45,615
If we leave it

143
00:07:45,654 --> 00:07:47,784
to the ghosts, there's no
telling what could happen.

144
00:07:49,563 --> 00:07:51,591
I think I know just the people
you're looking for.

145
00:07:51,635 --> 00:07:53,036
Good. We're going to need them.

146
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:55,636
Hey, Bell, you're really missing
something over here.

147
00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:04,130
Many of the district employees
fleeing the riot

148
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,294
have been reported injured

149
00:08:05,335 --> 00:08:07,568
and several have yet
to be accounted for.

150
00:08:07,607 --> 00:08:09,840
There's been no official count
of injuries

151
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:11,314
among Sanctuary residents.

152
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:14,881
However, satellite pictures show
a number of possible casualties.

153
00:08:14,925 --> 00:08:16,519
We'll have more on this story

154
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:18,556
as information
becomes available.

155
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,568
This is terrible.

156
00:08:19,602 --> 00:08:20,901
I've got to get down there.

157
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:22,842
What are you talking about?

158
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,346
My friends are in there.

159
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,610
I know they are

160
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,644
but there's nothing
you can do for them.

161
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:29,626
I have to try.

162
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,893
Jadzia, it is too dangerous.
You could get hurt.

163
00:08:31,932 --> 00:08:33,595
I just can't stay here
and watch that place burn

164
00:08:33,636 --> 00:08:34,832
knowing my friends are inside.

165
00:08:34,873 --> 00:08:37,778
Look, I have friends
in the police department.

166
00:08:37,813 --> 00:08:40,718
When things settle down a little
bit, I will talk to them.

167
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,188
I can't wait that long.

168
00:08:42,223 --> 00:08:44,091
By the time things settle down

169
00:08:44,128 --> 00:08:46,326
my friends could be hurt
or even killed.

170
00:08:46,367 --> 00:08:48,030
They don't belong in there.

171
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,630
None of those people do.

172
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:54,550
First Officer's Log,
supplemental.

173
00:08:54,586 --> 00:08:57,890
Somehow, Sisko, Dax and Bashir
have altered Earth's history.

174
00:08:57,928 --> 00:09:01,391
We have no choice but to send
an away team into the past

175
00:09:01,469 --> 00:09:05,240
to try to find them and correct
the changes to the timeline.

176
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:06,713
The only problem is

177
00:09:06,748 --> 00:09:09,585
we're not exactly sure
where to look, or when.

178
00:09:09,622 --> 00:09:11,855
According to our
computer simulations

179
00:09:11,895 --> 00:09:13,660
the degree
of temporal displacement

180
00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:14,963
is directly proportional

181
00:09:15,002 --> 00:09:17,132
to the number
of chroniton particles

182
00:09:17,174 --> 00:09:19,441
interacting with
the transporter beam.

183
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:22,316
Unfortunately, there's no way
to know the exact concentration

184
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,118
of particles at the time
of the accident

185
00:09:24,157 --> 00:09:26,891
but I've narrowed it down
to ten possibilities

186
00:09:26,931 --> 00:09:29,995
each one corresponding
with a different time frame.

187
00:09:30,038 --> 00:09:31,564
One of them has to be right.

188
00:09:31,608 --> 00:09:33,373
We just hope we find
the right one

189
00:09:33,413 --> 00:09:36,045
before we run out
of chroniton particles.

190
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,299
I feel ridiculous.

191
00:09:42,334 --> 00:09:47,438
Well, it does effectively
disguise your Bajoran heritage.

192
00:09:47,479 --> 00:09:50,213
Just say you broke your nose.

193
00:09:50,253 --> 00:09:51,847
On the other hand, uh...

194
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,054
maybe you better say nothing.

195
00:09:54,096 --> 00:09:55,725
I'll do the talking.

196
00:09:55,766 --> 00:09:57,634
That's fine with me.

197
00:09:57,671 --> 00:09:58,799
Good luck.

198
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,038
Energize.

199
00:10:11,136 --> 00:10:14,440
If this is where Commander Sisko
and the others materialized

200
00:10:14,478 --> 00:10:16,949
there should be a residual
electrostatic charge.

201
00:10:16,984 --> 00:10:18,818
Kira to Sisko.

202
00:10:20,826 --> 00:10:22,489
Kira to Dax.

203
00:10:24,168 --> 00:10:25,603
Kira to Bashir.

204
00:10:25,671 --> 00:10:29,305
Judging by this vehicle, I'd say
we're in the mid-20th century.

205
00:10:29,347 --> 00:10:31,147
No one's responding to my hails.

206
00:10:31,184 --> 00:10:33,212
I'm not reading any
electrostatic variance

207
00:10:33,256 --> 00:10:34,520
or any distress signals.

208
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:36,153
They're definitely not here.

209
00:10:36,196 --> 00:10:38,497
How long before
the transporter re-engages?

210
00:10:38,536 --> 00:10:39,664
About 30 seconds.

211
00:10:47,056 --> 00:10:49,027
Evening.

212
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,056
I... I broke my nose.

213
00:10:56,412 --> 00:10:59,180
I told you not to say anything.

214
00:11:01,524 --> 00:11:04,053
I've got one question
for you two:

215
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:06,625
What are all these gimmes
doing here?

216
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:08,867
I asked them to help.

217
00:11:08,908 --> 00:11:10,241
And who invited you?

218
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:11,747
I did.

219
00:11:11,781 --> 00:11:13,512
Look, last time I checked,
this was my party.

220
00:11:13,553 --> 00:11:17,552
That means I get to decide who's
on the guest list and who isn't.

221
00:11:17,595 --> 00:11:19,566
We needed people we could trust
in here.

222
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,662
What's that supposed to mean?

223
00:11:21,705 --> 00:11:24,006
How many ghosts do you know
who you can really trust?

224
00:11:25,281 --> 00:11:28,186
One... me.
And that's enough.

225
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:30,556
No, it isn't.
Not here, not now!

226
00:11:30,593 --> 00:11:34,398
We need people to guard the
building, watch the exits

227
00:11:34,436 --> 00:11:37,706
keep an eye on the hostages
when we need to sleep.

228
00:11:37,811 --> 00:11:39,576
All right, all right,
you made your point.

229
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:40,914
Just keep them out of my hair.

230
00:11:40,952 --> 00:11:42,512
The important thing
we have to decide

231
00:11:42,555 --> 00:11:44,423
is what we're going to do
with those hostages.

232
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,428
Don't worry about that.

233
00:11:45,462 --> 00:11:47,159
I've got it all figured out.

234
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,364
I bet you do.

235
00:11:49,405 --> 00:11:51,569
And just to prove
I'm not such a bad guy

236
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:53,514
I'm going to let
you two in on it.

237
00:11:55,319 --> 00:11:56,948
It's simple.

238
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,724
We trade the hostages
for our freedom.

239
00:11:59,763 --> 00:12:02,827
We get amnesty,
a handful of credit chips

240
00:12:02,871 --> 00:12:05,308
and a flight
to anywhere we want.

241
00:12:05,343 --> 00:12:07,907
Personally,
I'm thinking Tasmania.

242
00:12:09,988 --> 00:12:11,719
Tasmania...

243
00:12:11,825 --> 00:12:13,317
Errol Flynn

244
00:12:13,362 --> 00:12:15,059
was born in Tasmania!

245
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:17,365
Look, you guys go where you want

246
00:12:17,406 --> 00:12:18,739
and I'll go where I want,
all right?

247
00:12:18,776 --> 00:12:19,835
Yeah, and as soon

248
00:12:19,878 --> 00:12:21,746
as we step off the plane,
they lock us up.

249
00:12:21,849 --> 00:12:24,116
Besides, we just can't think
about ourselves.

250
00:12:24,155 --> 00:12:26,058
There are 10,000 people
living in here.

251
00:12:26,093 --> 00:12:27,961
Well, let them get
their own hostages.

252
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:28,966
No, Gabe is right.

253
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,028
This is an opportunity
for us to be heard

254
00:12:31,072 --> 00:12:32,632
to let people
on the outside know

255
00:12:32,675 --> 00:12:34,235
exactly what's going on in here.

256
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,308
You want to make demands?

257
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,580
I'll give you some demands.

258
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,420
We tell them if they want
the hostages back

259
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:41,760
they've got to shut down
the Sanctuaries.

260
00:12:41,797 --> 00:12:44,268
And reinstate
the Federal Employment Act.

261
00:12:44,304 --> 00:12:46,468
Why don't you have them throw in
a couple of silk shirts?

262
00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:49,641
Maybe a penthouse in Singapore?

263
00:12:49,683 --> 00:12:53,089
Jobs?
You guys want jobs?

264
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:56,998
When are you going to get it?
There are no jobs!

265
00:12:57,033 --> 00:12:58,092
Not for us, anyway.

266
00:12:58,137 --> 00:13:00,165
They'll find jobs.

267
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:01,643
They'll have to.

268
00:13:01,678 --> 00:13:04,819
After tonight, they won't
be able to ignore us anymore.

269
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:06,980
All right.

270
00:13:07,024 --> 00:13:09,792
All right.
We'll do it your way.

271
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:12,302
I'll log on the Interface,
and I'll tell them

272
00:13:12,404 --> 00:13:14,238
that we want
the District closed.

273
00:13:14,275 --> 00:13:16,212
Not you, him.

274
00:13:20,423 --> 00:13:24,296
Uh, funny, I... I
would have nominated you.

275
00:13:24,332 --> 00:13:26,235
What?

276
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,434
Is there something wrong
with me?

277
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,039
I can be as eloquent
as the next guy.

278
00:13:31,082 --> 00:13:32,141
I'm sure you can.

279
00:13:32,184 --> 00:13:36,057
But they can't dismiss Webb
as easily as you or me.

280
00:13:36,094 --> 00:13:38,794
He's got the face,
he's got the family.

281
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:40,531
He's the guy next door.

282
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:43,544
And that's
what they need to see.

283
00:13:56,142 --> 00:13:59,240
My name is Michael Webb.

284
00:13:59,282 --> 00:14:04,124
I used to be a plant manager
at ChemTech Industries.

285
00:14:04,161 --> 00:14:09,539
I'm speaking for the residents
of Sanctuary District "A."

286
00:14:09,574 --> 00:14:12,376
We are holding six hostages.

287
00:14:12,481 --> 00:14:15,249
We don't want to hurt them.

288
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:16,382
All we want is...

289
00:14:17,727 --> 00:14:18,855
What happened?

290
00:14:18,897 --> 00:14:20,993
Someone cut off our access
to the Interface.

291
00:14:21,035 --> 00:14:22,265
I knew it!

292
00:14:22,305 --> 00:14:24,674
I knew this was a waste of time.

293
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,179
They don't care.

294
00:14:26,214 --> 00:14:27,740
No one cares about us.

295
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,253
Why should they?

296
00:14:29,288 --> 00:14:31,452
You're all a bunch of losers.

297
00:14:33,231 --> 00:14:34,928
What did you say?

298
00:14:34,968 --> 00:14:36,437
He didn't say anything.

299
00:14:36,505 --> 00:14:37,997
You heard me.

300
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,446
I called you a loser
'cause that's what you are

301
00:14:40,515 --> 00:14:42,986
and this time,
you're going to lose big.

302
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:45,589
That's enough!

303
00:14:47,131 --> 00:14:50,127
And check your E-mail, buddy.

304
00:14:50,171 --> 00:14:51,765
You're a loser, too.

305
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:54,407
If you want to get out of here,
you better hope you're wrong.

306
00:14:54,448 --> 00:14:56,942
Quiet down, Vin.
You'll only make things worse.

307
00:14:56,988 --> 00:14:59,825
I just want these guys to know
what they're in for.

308
00:14:59,861 --> 00:15:00,851
I bet the National Guard

309
00:15:00,897 --> 00:15:02,332
already has this place
surrounded.

310
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,966
Sooner or later, they're going
to come rolling right in here

311
00:15:05,007 --> 00:15:07,240
and you people aren't
even going to slow them down.

312
00:15:09,484 --> 00:15:13,186
I really think we
should kill this guy.

313
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:17,634
Mr. Webb, I'm Detective Preston,
from the SFPD.

314
00:15:17,671 --> 00:15:20,644
It's urgent
that I speak with you.

315
00:15:20,678 --> 00:15:23,115
Did you shut off our access
to the Interface?

316
00:15:23,151 --> 00:15:24,882
I'm afraid
it's Department policy

317
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:26,481
in these types of situations

318
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:29,293
but it does give us
a chance to talk one-on-one.

319
00:15:31,203 --> 00:15:33,801
All right, let's talk.

320
00:15:33,843 --> 00:15:35,837
First, I want to see
the hostages.

321
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,518
What for?

322
00:15:40,626 --> 00:15:42,927
I need to make sure
they're okay.

323
00:15:42,964 --> 00:15:45,801
You said you weren't
going to hurt them.

324
00:15:45,838 --> 00:15:47,501
I need to know
I can count on that.

325
00:15:47,542 --> 00:15:48,636
Get up, let's go.

326
00:15:48,678 --> 00:15:50,113
They want to see a hostage?

327
00:15:50,148 --> 00:15:51,276
Let's show them a hostage.

328
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:52,308
Take a good look, lady.

329
00:15:52,353 --> 00:15:53,652
I've got five more
just like her.

330
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,957
And if we don't
get what we want

331
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:58,092
they're going to get hurt.

332
00:16:03,982 --> 00:16:06,682
I think you've made your point.

333
00:16:06,722 --> 00:16:08,282
Have I, Detective?

334
00:16:08,326 --> 00:16:09,625
I'd say so.

335
00:16:09,662 --> 00:16:10,961
Good.

336
00:16:10,998 --> 00:16:12,729
Look, um, if you don't mind

337
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:15,240
I'd like to speak
with Mr. Webb again.

338
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:16,539
Why would I mind?

339
00:16:16,611 --> 00:16:18,980
All right, Detective,
I'm here.

340
00:16:19,018 --> 00:16:21,421
Your friend has quite a temper.

341
00:16:23,395 --> 00:16:25,730
That's because he's angry.

342
00:16:25,767 --> 00:16:27,066
We all are.

343
00:16:27,104 --> 00:16:29,872
B.C., let me ask you something.

344
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,379
Go ahead.

345
00:16:31,414 --> 00:16:33,043
Why do I get the feeling

346
00:16:33,084 --> 00:16:35,214
that you're not
going to be happy

347
00:16:35,256 --> 00:16:37,888
until you've hurt
one of those hostages?

348
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:41,426
I have to admit,
the thought has crossed my mind.

349
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,940
It might alleviate

350
00:16:42,975 --> 00:16:45,139
some of the, uh,
stress I'm feeling.

351
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:49,851
I think you'd better find a way
to deal with that stress.

352
00:16:49,892 --> 00:16:51,920
It's sure to be
a whole lot healthier

353
00:16:51,963 --> 00:16:53,330
for you in the long run.

354
00:16:54,502 --> 00:16:56,871
No kidding.

355
00:16:56,909 --> 00:16:59,142
Let me ask you something.

356
00:16:59,181 --> 00:17:03,681
You think it looks
better like this

357
00:17:03,724 --> 00:17:06,127
or like this?

358
00:17:06,164 --> 00:17:08,101
It's your head...

359
00:17:10,374 --> 00:17:12,242
and your decision.

360
00:17:12,278 --> 00:17:15,410
Hey, Gabe, Detective Preston
wants to meet with me.

361
00:17:15,453 --> 00:17:16,752
When?

362
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:18,315
Now, by the main gate.

363
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,624
May I join you?

364
00:17:19,697 --> 00:17:21,462
I was hoping you'd say that.

365
00:17:21,501 --> 00:17:22,834
Keep an eye on the hostages.

366
00:17:22,871 --> 00:17:24,636
Got it.

367
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:26,178
Good luck.

368
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,342
It's been a long night.

369
00:17:28,384 --> 00:17:29,580
For all of us.

370
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,887
You guys must be exhausted.

371
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:33,520
We're okay.

372
00:17:33,563 --> 00:17:36,468
We could use some breakfast
come morning.

373
00:17:36,503 --> 00:17:38,029
Breakfast for 10,000?

374
00:17:38,073 --> 00:17:39,873
That's a lot of take-out

375
00:17:39,912 --> 00:17:42,042
but in the interest
of friendship

376
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,054
I'll do what I can.

377
00:17:44,088 --> 00:17:46,321
Now, how about
returning the favor

378
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,026
and letting me have
one of the hostages?

379
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:52,667
No hostage, no food...
is that what you're saying?

380
00:17:52,709 --> 00:17:54,110
Not at all.

381
00:17:54,146 --> 00:17:56,310
You'll get the food either way.

382
00:17:56,351 --> 00:17:59,518
Giving up one of the hostages
would show good faith.

383
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:03,397
Besides, you'd still have
five left.

384
00:18:03,435 --> 00:18:05,872
Those hostages
aren't going anywhere

385
00:18:05,907 --> 00:18:07,775
until we get what we want.

386
00:18:07,812 --> 00:18:09,908
Which is what?

387
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,351
We want the Sanctuaries closed

388
00:18:11,387 --> 00:18:13,324
and the Federal
Employment Act reinstated.

389
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,957
That's asking a lot.

390
00:18:15,998 --> 00:18:17,467
I don't think so.

391
00:18:17,501 --> 00:18:20,839
What we want is to get out
from behind these walls...

392
00:18:20,876 --> 00:18:23,006
to stop having
to depend on handouts.

393
00:18:23,048 --> 00:18:24,517
That's right.

394
00:18:24,551 --> 00:18:27,251
All we're asking for is a chance
to get back on our feet again.

395
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,820
We don't deserve
to be locked up in here.

396
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,734
Obviously, I can't
make any promises

397
00:18:34,843 --> 00:18:38,750
but... I will see to it
the Governor hears your demands.

398
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:40,379
You do that.

399
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,657
Are you all right?

400
00:18:57,698 --> 00:18:58,997
Hey!

401
00:18:59,034 --> 00:19:00,196
Leave her alone.

402
00:19:00,237 --> 00:19:01,467
I'm a doctor.

403
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:03,272
Sure you are.

404
00:19:05,984 --> 00:19:08,752
You were here the other day,
weren't you?

405
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,090
That's right.

406
00:19:12,266 --> 00:19:15,171
Are you hypoglycemic?

407
00:19:15,206 --> 00:19:17,040
You really are a doctor.

408
00:19:17,078 --> 00:19:19,311
Why didn't you tell someone?

409
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,787
I was afraid to.

410
00:19:21,822 --> 00:19:24,351
Well, I'll see about
getting you some medicine.

411
00:19:24,395 --> 00:19:25,887
In the meantime

412
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:28,496
I'll try and find you
a chocolate bar or something.

413
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,210
I'm going to get some sleep.

414
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:37,217
He was here with you,
wasn't he?

415
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,728
Bell?

416
00:19:38,763 --> 00:19:41,132
We came in together.

417
00:19:41,168 --> 00:19:43,162
He gave me a false name,
didn't he?

418
00:19:43,207 --> 00:19:45,678
Well...

419
00:19:45,713 --> 00:19:47,182
yes.

420
00:19:47,217 --> 00:19:50,623
He got into a little trouble
a while back

421
00:19:50,658 --> 00:19:53,597
and um... didn't want you
to put his real name

422
00:19:53,632 --> 00:19:56,503
on the computer.

423
00:19:56,539 --> 00:20:00,982
When I first started
working here

424
00:20:01,016 --> 00:20:05,584
I processed a woman
who had a warrant out on her

425
00:20:05,628 --> 00:20:09,034
for abandoning her kid.

426
00:20:09,068 --> 00:20:13,374
She couldn't take care of him.

427
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:16,818
So she left him with a family
that she worked for

428
00:20:16,854 --> 00:20:19,383
over in the Marina.

429
00:20:21,432 --> 00:20:24,337
I felt so sorry for her.

430
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:28,173
I didn't log her in.

431
00:20:28,214 --> 00:20:31,279
I just let her disappear
into the Sanctuary.

432
00:20:31,413 --> 00:20:33,247
Well, that was very kind of you.

433
00:20:33,284 --> 00:20:39,197
Almost got me fired
when my supervisor found out.

434
00:20:39,231 --> 00:20:41,259
What happened to this woman?

435
00:20:42,606 --> 00:20:45,670
I don't know.

436
00:20:45,714 --> 00:20:49,621
But I think about her
all the time.

437
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,804
Ever since then,
I've just done my job, you know.

438
00:20:57,843 --> 00:21:01,113
Tried not to let it
get the best of me.

439
00:21:03,489 --> 00:21:06,485
It's not your fault that
things are the way they are.

440
00:21:10,273 --> 00:21:14,545
Everybody tells themselves that

441
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:18,216
and nothing ever changes.

442
00:21:38,841 --> 00:21:39,969
Hold it!

443
00:21:41,013 --> 00:21:43,416
Don't!
Don't do it, B. C!

444
00:21:43,452 --> 00:21:45,514
Give me one reason why not.

445
00:21:45,557 --> 00:21:46,856
All right.

446
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:56,079
You really going to shoot me,
Bell?

447
00:21:56,116 --> 00:21:57,881
I don't think so.

448
00:21:57,921 --> 00:21:59,117
Think again.

449
00:22:00,794 --> 00:22:02,924
I thought we were
on the same side here!

450
00:22:02,966 --> 00:22:06,304
We are,
but you get on my nerves

451
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,777
and I don't like your hat.

452
00:22:08,813 --> 00:22:10,807
Now, put the gun down.

453
00:22:10,851 --> 00:22:12,651
Yeah, you and I can see
how tough you really are.

454
00:22:13,324 --> 00:22:14,349
Shut up!

455
00:22:17,701 --> 00:22:18,829
Now, put it down!

456
00:22:28,593 --> 00:22:30,757
You heard the man.

457
00:22:38,317 --> 00:22:39,445
You gimmes...

458
00:22:39,487 --> 00:22:41,822
no sense of fun.

459
00:22:43,262 --> 00:22:44,230
Come here!

460
00:22:44,264 --> 00:22:45,426
Hey!

461
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,641
Now, you listen to me closely

462
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,548
because I'm not going
to say this again.

463
00:22:52,584 --> 00:22:54,349
The next time you
try something stupid

464
00:22:54,388 --> 00:22:55,618
I will make you regret it.

465
00:22:55,658 --> 00:22:57,492
You trying to scare me?

466
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:00,059
I'm trying to save your life

467
00:23:00,102 --> 00:23:02,164
and the lives of every hostage
in that room

468
00:23:02,207 --> 00:23:04,269
and, Mister, you
are not making it easy.

469
00:23:04,312 --> 00:23:06,306
If you're so concerned
about our welfare

470
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,649
why don't you let us go?

471
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:14,065
You don't know what any
of this is about, do you?

472
00:23:14,103 --> 00:23:15,402
You work here.

473
00:23:15,439 --> 00:23:18,936
You see these people every day...
how they live...

474
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:21,111
and you just don't get it!

475
00:23:21,153 --> 00:23:23,488
What do you want me to say?

476
00:23:23,525 --> 00:23:25,154
That I feel for them?

477
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:26,996
That they got a bad break?

478
00:23:27,033 --> 00:23:28,593
What good would it do?

479
00:23:28,637 --> 00:23:30,870
It would be a start.

480
00:23:33,616 --> 00:23:39,256
Now, you get back in that room
and you shut up.

481
00:23:51,927 --> 00:23:55,527
Kira to Sisko.

482
00:23:55,569 --> 00:23:58,235
Kira to Dax.

483
00:23:58,275 --> 00:23:59,744
Kira to Bashir.

484
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:01,579
I'm not picking up

485
00:24:01,616 --> 00:24:03,746
any residual
electrostatic charge.

486
00:24:03,856 --> 00:24:05,759
What?

487
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,560
I said I'm not picking up any
residual electrostatic charge!

488
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,069
What?!

489
00:24:10,103 --> 00:24:11,231
They're not here!

490
00:24:18,022 --> 00:24:20,152
Thank you.

491
00:24:34,295 --> 00:24:35,628
Uh-oh...

492
00:24:36,834 --> 00:24:38,326
Wow.

493
00:24:48,562 --> 00:24:49,530
Danny.

494
00:24:49,564 --> 00:24:51,033
Dad...

495
00:24:51,069 --> 00:24:53,336
He was outside looking for you.

496
00:24:53,374 --> 00:24:55,868
Your mother and Jennie...
are they okay?

497
00:24:55,946 --> 00:24:57,540
They're fine.
They're with the Petersons.

498
00:24:57,584 --> 00:24:59,851
So, what are you doing here?

499
00:24:59,889 --> 00:25:02,487
I wanted to be with you.

500
00:25:02,529 --> 00:25:03,998
All right.

501
00:25:04,033 --> 00:25:06,368
All right, you can
stay for a while

502
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:08,136
but when I tell you to go

503
00:25:08,175 --> 00:25:09,940
I don't want to hear arguments.

504
00:25:17,031 --> 00:25:20,802
Now that didn't hurt
a bit, did it?

505
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:24,302
I managed to find some glucajen
in what was left of the clinic.

506
00:25:24,348 --> 00:25:26,478
You should be
feeling better soon.

507
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,251
Thank you.

508
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:30,194
Is that your family?

509
00:25:32,601 --> 00:25:34,002
Yeah.

510
00:25:34,038 --> 00:25:35,530
Let him see it.

511
00:25:43,294 --> 00:25:44,490
Nice looking bunch, huh?

512
00:25:44,529 --> 00:25:45,930
Absolutely.

513
00:25:46,033 --> 00:25:48,938
Right now, those two kids
are sitting at home

514
00:25:48,974 --> 00:25:51,913
wondering if they'll
ever see their dad again.

515
00:25:51,948 --> 00:25:54,112
Look, I realize
this won't make

516
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:56,682
what you're going through
any easier

517
00:25:56,725 --> 00:25:59,857
but something good
will come from all this.

518
00:26:01,905 --> 00:26:04,878
You think they're just going
to close down the Sanctuary

519
00:26:04,912 --> 00:26:06,404
and let you walk out of here?

520
00:26:06,449 --> 00:26:08,613
No...

521
00:26:08,654 --> 00:26:10,921
but I do know that someday

522
00:26:10,993 --> 00:26:14,194
there won't be a need
for places like this.

523
00:26:15,971 --> 00:26:18,033
I hope you're right.

524
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,910
Even though it'll mean
I'll be out of a job

525
00:26:19,948 --> 00:26:22,785
I hope you're right.

526
00:26:22,821 --> 00:26:25,419
I just want to get home...

527
00:26:25,461 --> 00:26:26,953
you know?

528
00:26:27,065 --> 00:26:28,659
I know.

529
00:26:28,702 --> 00:26:31,436
So do I.

530
00:26:34,182 --> 00:26:37,212
The Governor assures me
that if you let the hostages go

531
00:26:37,256 --> 00:26:39,250
he'll reduce the charges
against you

532
00:26:39,294 --> 00:26:40,820
to incitement to riot.

533
00:26:40,864 --> 00:26:43,462
That's it?

534
00:26:43,504 --> 00:26:45,269
What about closing
the Sanctuary?

535
00:26:45,308 --> 00:26:46,367
What about jobs?

536
00:26:46,411 --> 00:26:48,176
The Governor intends
to form a committee

537
00:26:48,215 --> 00:26:50,744
to look into the problems
facing the District residents.

538
00:26:50,788 --> 00:26:53,989
So, what you're telling us is
that nothing is going to change.

539
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,023
I wouldn't say that.

540
00:26:56,067 --> 00:26:58,300
But change takes time.

541
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,709
You've run out of time.

542
00:27:00,746 --> 00:27:02,614
Gentlemen...

543
00:27:02,651 --> 00:27:04,120
if I were you

544
00:27:04,154 --> 00:27:06,202
I would seriously consider
taking this offer.

545
00:27:06,335 --> 00:27:07,497
Or else what?

546
00:27:07,537 --> 00:27:10,841
The Governor is not going
to let this situation

547
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,439
continue forever.

548
00:27:16,493 --> 00:27:20,093
You tell him if he wants
to see those hostages again

549
00:27:20,135 --> 00:27:22,629
he's going to have to do better.

550
00:27:29,223 --> 00:27:30,658
Tough talk.

551
00:27:30,694 --> 00:27:32,129
I was bluffing.

552
00:27:32,164 --> 00:27:33,690
I couldn't tell.

553
00:27:33,734 --> 00:27:36,298
I hope she couldn't either.

554
00:28:15,868 --> 00:28:17,805
Try opening that menu.

555
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:21,939
It just brings me back
to the same screen.

556
00:28:21,982 --> 00:28:23,144
There doesn't seem to be any way

557
00:28:23,186 --> 00:28:25,214
of getting past the lockout
and logging onto the Net.

558
00:28:25,257 --> 00:28:26,225
There has to be.

559
00:28:26,259 --> 00:28:28,321
How can you be certain?

560
00:28:28,364 --> 00:28:29,663
Because according to history

561
00:28:29,701 --> 00:28:31,672
the residents were
able to get onto the Net

562
00:28:31,706 --> 00:28:33,198
and tell their side
of the story.

563
00:28:33,243 --> 00:28:35,146
Millions of people watched.

564
00:28:35,181 --> 00:28:38,553
Well, no one here's been able
to get past the lockout.

565
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,618
Maybe it was Bell.

566
00:28:40,661 --> 00:28:43,828
And if he did it,
we have to, also.

567
00:28:43,869 --> 00:28:45,634
Hey, listen up, everybody.

568
00:28:45,673 --> 00:28:49,136
A couple of dims just brought us
a little present.

569
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,542
I don't know about you fellas,
but I'm in love.

570
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:04,745
Jadzia...

571
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:05,913
You know her?

572
00:29:05,955 --> 00:29:07,356
Julian.

573
00:29:08,962 --> 00:29:10,397
Can you believe it?

574
00:29:10,432 --> 00:29:12,426
That's the story of my life.

575
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:14,441
All the good ones are taken.

576
00:29:14,542 --> 00:29:16,740
You remember my friend, Gabe.

577
00:29:16,781 --> 00:29:18,114
Gabriel Bell.

578
00:29:18,151 --> 00:29:19,450
Good to see you again.

579
00:29:19,487 --> 00:29:21,287
Good to see you.

580
00:29:21,325 --> 00:29:23,957
Allow me to introduce myself.

581
00:29:23,998 --> 00:29:25,627
Biddle Coleridge.

582
00:29:25,668 --> 00:29:26,762
Biddle?

583
00:29:26,805 --> 00:29:27,465
Hey!

584
00:29:28,508 --> 00:29:29,704
I didn't say a word.

585
00:29:29,745 --> 00:29:32,377
I've been looking
all over for you.

586
00:29:32,418 --> 00:29:34,480
Excuse me.

587
00:29:34,557 --> 00:29:39,297
You obviously don't live here,
so how did you get in?

588
00:29:39,335 --> 00:29:41,465
I managed to re-code
my I.D. Card

589
00:29:41,507 --> 00:29:43,307
so that I could get past

590
00:29:43,344 --> 00:29:45,815
the Sanitation
Department Checkpoint.

591
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:48,688
You, you crawled in
through the sewers?

592
00:29:48,724 --> 00:29:51,424
You must really like these guys.

593
00:29:51,464 --> 00:29:53,958
You should, uh, sit down.

594
00:29:54,003 --> 00:29:55,997
You must be exhausted.

595
00:30:02,056 --> 00:30:03,685
It's too bad.

596
00:30:03,727 --> 00:30:05,458
I think me and her

597
00:30:05,497 --> 00:30:07,126
could have had
something special.

598
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:09,834
So what you're saying is

599
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:12,004
that even if I could get
you out, you wouldn't leave.

600
00:30:12,046 --> 00:30:14,313
Those hostages have to be
protected, whatever the cost.

601
00:30:14,352 --> 00:30:15,946
You said that one of the men

602
00:30:15,989 --> 00:30:18,290
who brought you here took
your combadge?

603
00:30:18,328 --> 00:30:19,695
That's right.

604
00:30:19,732 --> 00:30:21,726
And it's set to emit
a subspace distress signal.

605
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:24,607
Julian, I want you
to help Dax find the men

606
00:30:24,677 --> 00:30:26,739
who took her combadge

607
00:30:26,782 --> 00:30:29,049
and then I want both of you
to get away from this place.

608
00:30:29,087 --> 00:30:31,456
But if the <i>Defiant</i> locks on
to my distress signal

609
00:30:31,494 --> 00:30:32,724
and we're not together...

610
00:30:32,763 --> 00:30:35,600
As soon as the hostages
are in police custody

611
00:30:35,636 --> 00:30:38,473
I'll try to make it back
to the beam-in site.

612
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:40,207
If for some reason,
I can't make it

613
00:30:40,248 --> 00:30:41,842
you'll have to leave without me.

614
00:30:41,885 --> 00:30:44,049
Sir...

615
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:46,186
obviously,
Jadzia has got to leave.

616
00:30:46,228 --> 00:30:48,358
If something were
to happen to her

617
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,803
it wouldn't take a doctor long
to figure out she wasn't human.

618
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,811
But you're still going
to need help

619
00:30:52,844 --> 00:30:54,575
to keep those hostages alive.

620
00:30:54,615 --> 00:30:58,785
And if it's all the same
to you, I'll stay.

621
00:31:00,796 --> 00:31:02,265
All right.

622
00:31:02,301 --> 00:31:04,602
See if you can get
her combadge back.

623
00:31:04,639 --> 00:31:07,008
I'll keep trying
to log onto the Net.

624
00:31:11,021 --> 00:31:12,958
The police cut off our access.

625
00:31:12,993 --> 00:31:14,987
That's one problem
I might be able

626
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,465
to help you with.

627
00:31:24,988 --> 00:31:26,321
Do you really think

628
00:31:26,358 --> 00:31:28,488
you can convince your friend
to put us on the Net?

629
00:31:28,529 --> 00:31:29,828
It'll take some persuading

630
00:31:29,866 --> 00:31:31,700
but I think
he'll do what's right.

631
00:31:31,738 --> 00:31:32,706
This is it.

632
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:35,338
The men who took my combadge
brought me here

633
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:38,376
before they took me
to the Processing Center.

634
00:31:49,446 --> 00:31:51,006
Hello?

635
00:31:54,124 --> 00:31:55,593
Hello?

636
00:31:55,628 --> 00:31:57,622
There's nobody here.

637
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,877
Uh, we just want to talk.

638
00:32:14,239 --> 00:32:15,868
Whoosh.

639
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:18,612
I'm invisible.

640
00:32:20,755 --> 00:32:22,224
If you say so.

641
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,466
You can see me?

642
00:32:28,507 --> 00:32:31,845
Just... barely.

643
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:34,921
That's okay.

644
00:32:34,955 --> 00:32:36,949
As long as they can't see me.

645
00:32:38,431 --> 00:32:39,900
Who?

646
00:32:39,934 --> 00:32:41,301
The aliens.

647
00:32:41,337 --> 00:32:44,504
They'll suck your brains out
right through your ears.

648
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:46,517
I know.

649
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:49,455
You see, I'm an alien.

650
00:32:51,195 --> 00:32:52,687
I thought so...

651
00:32:52,731 --> 00:32:54,668
but you're a good alien.

652
00:32:54,703 --> 00:32:56,697
Right.
I'm here to protect

653
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:58,644
the Earth from its enemies

654
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:02,347
but I need that piece of jewelry
you're holding to do it.

655
00:33:02,387 --> 00:33:03,686
I understand.

656
00:33:03,724 --> 00:33:05,159
Here, you take it.

657
00:33:06,131 --> 00:33:08,068
Good luck.

658
00:33:08,101 --> 00:33:10,334
Thank you.

659
00:33:10,374 --> 00:33:13,279
Shh, don't tell anyone.

660
00:33:13,314 --> 00:33:15,114
I won't, I won't.

661
00:33:30,455 --> 00:33:32,186
I came in there.

662
00:33:37,639 --> 00:33:39,576
Take care of yourself.

663
00:33:39,611 --> 00:33:41,080
We'll see you
at the beam-in site.

664
00:33:48,967 --> 00:33:52,533
Let me see if I understand
what you're asking me to do.

665
00:33:52,575 --> 00:33:54,910
You want me to override
a government block

666
00:33:54,981 --> 00:33:57,475
violate my Interface
operating license

667
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,251
and turn over my channels
to a bunch of criminals.

668
00:33:59,291 --> 00:34:00,259
They're not criminals.

669
00:34:00,293 --> 00:34:01,261
I know that

670
00:34:01,296 --> 00:34:03,529
but they are acting
like criminals.

671
00:34:03,568 --> 00:34:05,002
They have guns,
they have taken hostages...

672
00:34:05,135 --> 00:34:06,798
So why do you think
they're doing it?

673
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,241
Don't you want to know?

674
00:34:08,277 --> 00:34:10,714
Don't you think that the public
deserves to know?

675
00:34:12,887 --> 00:34:15,256
You are asking me
to break the law.

676
00:34:15,293 --> 00:34:18,825
I am asking you
to give those people a voice.

677
00:34:18,868 --> 00:34:20,531
Chris, sooner or later

678
00:34:20,606 --> 00:34:24,138
the government is going to
retake the Sanctuary District

679
00:34:24,181 --> 00:34:27,451
and when they do, a lot
of people are going to die.

680
00:34:27,489 --> 00:34:29,483
And unless the public learns

681
00:34:29,527 --> 00:34:32,432
why the Sanctuary residents
did what they did

682
00:34:32,467 --> 00:34:34,870
all those deaths
will be for nothing.

683
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:37,607
You know I'll lose my license.

684
00:34:40,153 --> 00:34:41,850
But I'll get great ratings.

685
00:34:46,903 --> 00:34:48,771
My name is Henry Garcia.

686
00:34:48,806 --> 00:34:51,243
I've been living here
two years now.

687
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,276
I came to San Francisco
to work in a brewery

688
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,484
but they laid a bunch of us off

689
00:34:56,525 --> 00:34:59,464
because they got
some new equipment, and...

690
00:34:59,499 --> 00:35:01,402
so I ended up here.

691
00:35:01,437 --> 00:35:04,569
I've never been in trouble
with the law or anything.

692
00:35:04,678 --> 00:35:06,512
I don't want to hurt anybody.

693
00:35:06,549 --> 00:35:09,283
I just want a chance to work

694
00:35:09,323 --> 00:35:12,353
and to live like regular people.

695
00:35:17,275 --> 00:35:18,744
My name is Julie Hess...

696
00:35:18,778 --> 00:35:21,910
Governor, I understand
your concern

697
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:25,952
but I think the use of force
would be premature at this time.

698
00:35:25,996 --> 00:35:28,833
I am aware that there
have been disturbances

699
00:35:28,869 --> 00:35:30,897
in other Sanctuary Districts

700
00:35:30,941 --> 00:35:33,539
but we have to think
about the hostages.

701
00:35:33,581 --> 00:35:35,779
I know, I've heard
the rumors, too.

702
00:35:35,819 --> 00:35:38,290
That... that's all
they are, rumors.

703
00:35:38,325 --> 00:35:40,854
If you just give me
another chance

704
00:35:40,898 --> 00:35:43,301
to talk with Webb and Bell, I...

705
00:35:43,337 --> 00:35:45,433
Yes, sir.

706
00:35:46,612 --> 00:35:48,674
Of course.

707
00:35:48,717 --> 00:35:50,847
We'll do our best.

708
00:35:53,562 --> 00:35:56,558
The Governor's made up his mind.

709
00:35:56,602 --> 00:35:58,630
We move in at 0500.

710
00:36:14,345 --> 00:36:15,507
No luck?

711
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,279
I'm afraid not.

712
00:36:18,388 --> 00:36:20,256
Well, we know one thing.

713
00:36:20,292 --> 00:36:22,890
They arrived
before the year 2048.

714
00:36:22,932 --> 00:36:24,026
How can you be sure?

715
00:36:24,068 --> 00:36:25,367
Because we were just there.

716
00:36:25,405 --> 00:36:26,499
And it's nothing like

717
00:36:26,541 --> 00:36:28,409
the mid-21st century
I read about in school.

718
00:36:28,446 --> 00:36:30,040
It's been changed.

719
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:32,920
I mean, Earth history has been
through its rough patches

720
00:36:32,956 --> 00:36:34,050
but never that rough.

721
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:36,359
If we limit our search
to dates before 2048

722
00:36:36,398 --> 00:36:38,962
how many possibilities
does that leave us with?

723
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:43,074
According to my calculations,
three.

724
00:36:43,114 --> 00:36:46,452
But we only have
enough chroniton particles

725
00:36:46,489 --> 00:36:48,392
for one more try.

726
00:36:48,426 --> 00:36:50,990
Well, pick one, Chief.

727
00:36:51,033 --> 00:36:53,061
Let's hope you get lucky.

728
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:56,679
That's my best guess.

729
00:36:57,816 --> 00:36:59,980
That's good enough for me.

730
00:37:01,959 --> 00:37:03,223
Energize.

731
00:37:13,854 --> 00:37:15,882
Kira to Sisko.
Kira...

732
00:37:15,926 --> 00:37:18,660
I'm picking up a combadge
distress signal.

733
00:37:18,699 --> 00:37:20,168
It's Dax!

734
00:37:20,203 --> 00:37:21,672
Kira to Dax.

735
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:23,175
Dax, do you hear me?

736
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:24,406
Kira!

737
00:37:24,446 --> 00:37:26,576
Dax, am I glad
to hear your voice.

738
00:37:26,618 --> 00:37:28,087
Where are you?

739
00:37:28,122 --> 00:37:30,457
Were at the corner
of Polk and California.

740
00:37:30,494 --> 00:37:31,963
I'll meet you there.

741
00:37:31,997 --> 00:37:33,797
Are Sisko and Bashir with you?

742
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:35,703
No. I'll explain everything
when I see you.

743
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,936
The transporter is set

744
00:37:36,976 --> 00:37:39,447
to automatically retrieve
us in about a minute.

745
00:37:39,482 --> 00:37:41,385
You better deactivate
your combadge.

746
00:37:41,421 --> 00:37:42,685
Acknowledged.

747
00:37:42,723 --> 00:37:46,289
We can reactivate them tomorrow
in time for the next beam-out.

748
00:37:46,332 --> 00:37:48,200
Should be interesting.

749
00:37:48,236 --> 00:37:51,107
Best ball club I ever saw?

750
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:52,612
'99 Yankees, no doubt about it.

751
00:37:52,647 --> 00:37:53,843
Get out of here.

752
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:56,114
The '15 Kings could
have taken them any day.

753
00:37:56,155 --> 00:37:57,249
- C'mon!
- Am I right?

754
00:37:57,292 --> 00:37:59,263
I wouldn't know.
I prefer tennis.

755
00:37:59,297 --> 00:38:00,960
Tennis?

756
00:38:03,473 --> 00:38:04,999
Soccer.

757
00:38:05,044 --> 00:38:07,174
It's up to you, Bell.

758
00:38:07,216 --> 00:38:10,155
I don't think there's
any question... the Kings.

759
00:38:10,189 --> 00:38:12,753
'15 was Buck Bokai's
rookie year.

760
00:38:12,795 --> 00:38:15,597
That's all they had
going for them.

761
00:38:15,635 --> 00:38:17,366
I've been up on the roof.

762
00:38:17,407 --> 00:38:20,437
It looks like another
National Guard unit arrived.

763
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,713
There's something
going on out there.

764
00:38:22,752 --> 00:38:24,415
Everybody on your feet.

765
00:38:24,457 --> 00:38:25,858
What are you doing?

766
00:38:25,894 --> 00:38:27,557
They'll be safer in there.
Let's go!

767
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:32,531
Watch your step.

768
00:38:36,653 --> 00:38:37,986
I want you in there with them.

769
00:38:38,023 --> 00:38:39,686
Make sure they keep
their heads down.

770
00:38:39,727 --> 00:38:41,891
I'll see if I can find
something to block the door.

771
00:38:49,116 --> 00:38:50,642
Danny... Danny, wake up.

772
00:38:50,686 --> 00:38:52,315
Come on.

773
00:38:52,357 --> 00:38:54,328
It's time for you to go.

774
00:38:54,362 --> 00:38:56,526
Dad, I want to be here with you.

775
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:58,595
I'll meet up with you later.

776
00:39:01,813 --> 00:39:04,342
Tell your mom I love her.

777
00:39:04,386 --> 00:39:06,083
And you give your sister
a kiss for me, huh?

778
00:39:09,164 --> 00:39:10,463
Go on, now.

779
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,833
Go on.

780
00:39:17,584 --> 00:39:19,144
Hey, kid...

781
00:39:24,099 --> 00:39:27,231
Yeah, I thought so.

782
00:39:27,274 --> 00:39:29,211
Looks good on you.

783
00:39:29,245 --> 00:39:31,010
Now, get lost.

784
00:39:36,462 --> 00:39:37,954
What the hell.

785
00:39:38,033 --> 00:39:41,303
It's probably raining
in Tasmania anyway.

786
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:49,116
I'm going to call Preston
and find out what's going on.

787
00:39:57,613 --> 00:39:58,638
Oh, my God.

788
00:40:19,398 --> 00:40:21,027
Stop shooting, damn it!!

789
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,060
We're okay!

790
00:40:22,138 --> 00:40:23,071
Hold it!

791
00:40:23,175 --> 00:40:24,165
No!

792
00:40:26,182 --> 00:40:27,515
Bell!

793
00:40:27,552 --> 00:40:29,215
Don't move.

794
00:40:29,255 --> 00:40:30,747
Damage control.

795
00:40:30,792 --> 00:40:32,261
Freeze!

796
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:33,663
I'm a hostage, you idiot!

797
00:40:35,337 --> 00:40:36,772
Blue leader, this is Team One.

798
00:40:36,807 --> 00:40:39,108
The Processing Center is secure.

799
00:40:39,146 --> 00:40:40,513
What's wrong with you people?

800
00:40:40,549 --> 00:40:42,246
You could have gotten
us all killed.

801
00:40:42,286 --> 00:40:43,778
There were rumors you were dead.

802
00:40:43,824 --> 00:40:45,293
Do I look dead to you?

803
00:40:45,328 --> 00:40:47,799
Our orders were
to pacify the building.

804
00:40:47,833 --> 00:40:49,633
Yeah...

805
00:40:49,671 --> 00:40:51,904
well, you certainly did
a good job.

806
00:40:51,943 --> 00:40:53,412
I'm a doctor.

807
00:40:53,447 --> 00:40:54,916
Leave him alone.

808
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:56,750
I copy.

809
00:40:56,789 --> 00:40:57,951
All right, listen up.

810
00:40:57,991 --> 00:40:59,585
There's trouble
on Second Street.

811
00:40:59,629 --> 00:41:01,497
You go pacify Second Street.

812
00:41:01,533 --> 00:41:04,027
Officer Calvera and I
can handle things in here.

813
00:41:04,073 --> 00:41:05,125
Give me that.

814
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:09,399
All right men, let's move!

815
00:41:10,973 --> 00:41:12,738
How is he?

816
00:41:12,777 --> 00:41:14,577
Lucky. He'll live.

817
00:41:15,617 --> 00:41:18,590
The next time I tell you
to stay down, you...

818
00:41:18,624 --> 00:41:20,025
Gotcha.

819
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:21,360
Yeah.

820
00:41:21,397 --> 00:41:22,889
What about Webb?

821
00:41:43,851 --> 00:41:44,841
Keep the pressure on...

822
00:41:44,887 --> 00:41:45,946
Over here, quick!

823
00:41:47,727 --> 00:41:49,755
...unexploded shell
on the first floor.

824
00:41:49,799 --> 00:41:53,205
Can I get some
more bandages here?!

825
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,695
Mommy! Mommy!

826
00:42:05,804 --> 00:42:08,173
How could we have
let this happen?

827
00:42:10,147 --> 00:42:14,385
The question is, how do we
stop it from happening again?

828
00:42:22,276 --> 00:42:25,648
So what do we do with them?

829
00:42:25,685 --> 00:42:27,314
I don't know.

830
00:42:27,355 --> 00:42:28,949
You could let us go.

831
00:42:31,499 --> 00:42:32,489
All right.

832
00:42:32,535 --> 00:42:33,697
Vin!

833
00:42:33,737 --> 00:42:35,229
They saved our lives back there.

834
00:42:35,274 --> 00:42:37,336
How can we explain
what happened to them?

835
00:42:38,849 --> 00:42:40,820
Give me your I.D. Cards.

836
00:42:42,959 --> 00:42:44,326
Pocket.

837
00:42:49,508 --> 00:42:52,744
We'll switch these
for two of the casualties.

838
00:42:52,783 --> 00:42:55,449
As far as anybody knows...

839
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,859
you both died here.

840
00:42:57,895 --> 00:42:59,763
Is that okay with you, Bell?

841
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,896
Thanks.

842
00:43:01,972 --> 00:43:04,034
My pleasure.

843
00:43:04,077 --> 00:43:05,546
Come on.

844
00:43:05,581 --> 00:43:08,018
Let's get you out of here.

845
00:43:08,053 --> 00:43:10,320
Anything else we can do for you?

846
00:43:10,358 --> 00:43:12,089
There is one more thing.

847
00:43:12,129 --> 00:43:13,792
Name it.

848
00:43:13,833 --> 00:43:17,935
Tell people the truth
about what happened here.

849
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:20,277
I would have done that anyway.

850
00:43:25,829 --> 00:43:27,925
First Officer's Log,
supplemental.

851
00:43:27,967 --> 00:43:31,203
Upon returning to the present
with our missing crew members

852
00:43:31,242 --> 00:43:32,768
we were relieved to discover

853
00:43:32,812 --> 00:43:35,717
that the timeline
had been restored.

854
00:43:37,624 --> 00:43:39,116
Come in.

855
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:47,502
How do you feel?

856
00:43:47,547 --> 00:43:49,415
Better.

857
00:43:49,452 --> 00:43:51,855
I thought you might
like to see this.

858
00:43:51,891 --> 00:43:54,455
I found it
in the historical database.

859
00:43:59,978 --> 00:44:01,311
Oh.

860
00:44:01,348 --> 00:44:02,942
I'm not looking forward

861
00:44:02,985 --> 00:44:05,286
to explaining this
to Starfleet Command.

862
00:44:05,323 --> 00:44:08,262
Well, at least
it's a good picture.

863
00:44:08,297 --> 00:44:10,200
You know, Commander

864
00:44:10,235 --> 00:44:12,638
having seen a little
of the 21st century

865
00:44:12,675 --> 00:44:15,010
there is one thing
I don't understand.

866
00:44:15,047 --> 00:44:18,020
How could they have
let things get so bad?

867
00:44:18,121 --> 00:44:20,115
That's a good question.

868
00:44:24,068 --> 00:44:26,062
I wish I had an answer.
