00:00:01,168 --> 00:00:03,838
<i>LAST TIME ON</i>
STAR TREK DEEP SPACE NINE:

2
00:00:03,838 --> 00:00:06,757
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO COMMANDER SISKO
AND THE OTHERS.

3
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:08,968
THE TRANSPORTER BEAM WAS
REDIRECTED AS IT PASSED

4
00:00:08,968 --> 00:00:10,845
THROUGH THE POLARIZED PARTICLES.

5
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:12,304
REDIRECTED WHERE?

6
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:14,389
NOT WHERE--<i> WHEN.</i>

7
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:16,809
YOU EVER HEAR OF
THE BELL RIOTS? IT IS ONE
OF THE MOST VIOLENT

8
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:18,811
CIVIL DISTURBANCES
IN AMERICAN HISTORY

9
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:21,229
AND IT HAPPENED RIGHT HERE--
SAN FRANCISCO

10
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:22,731
SANCTUARY
DISTRICT "A"

11
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,775
THE FIRST WEEK
OF SEPTEMBER, 2024.

12
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:27,068
BUT THAT'S ONLY
A FEW DAYS FROM NOW.

13
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:28,737
THE RIOTS WILL BE

14
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:31,866
ONE OF THE WATERSHED EVENTS
OF THE 21st CENTURY.

15
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:33,826
GABRIEL BELL WILL SEE TO THAT.

16
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:35,870
I STILL HAVEN'T
FOUND MY FRIENDS.

17
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,913
YOU THINK THEY MIGHT BE
IN A SANCTUARY DISTRICT?

18
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:41,667
IT'S POSSIBLE. IF YOU HADN'T
FOUND ME, I MIGHT HAVE WOUND
UP IN ONE.

19
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,544
THIS PLACE IS
ABOUT TO EXPLODE.

20
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,504
MOST OF US AGREED
TO LIVE HERE

21
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:47,840
BECAUSE THEY PROMISED
US JOBS, BUT I DON'T
KNOW ABOUT YOU,?

22
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,175
BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN ON ANY
JOB INTERVIEWS LATELY.

23
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,386
THAT MAN WHO
JUST GOT KILLED

24
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:53,888
TRYING TO HELP US--

25
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:57,599
THAT MAN WAS
GABRIEL BELL.

26
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,810
(<i> crowd yelling</i> )

27
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:02,730
GIVE ME THAT!

28
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,398
(<i> pump loads gun</i> )

29
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,233
(<i> gunshot</i> )
GET AWAY, GET AWAY FROM HIM.

30
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:08,485
C'MON, WE HAVE TO GET HIM
OFF THE STREET.

31
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:11,279
I'VE WAITED
A LONG TIME FOR THIS.

32
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:15,993
AND I KNOW I WON'T
BE DISAPPOINTED.

33
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:18,662
AIN'T THAT RIGHT, NEWBOY?

34
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,163
THE NAME IS BELL.

35
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,375
GABRIEL BELL.

36
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:26,879
<i>AND NOW THE CONCLUSION.</i>

37
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:30,966
HEY! WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT?

38
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:32,885
NOTHING.

39
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:35,262
IF YOU'RE TRYING
TO FIND A WAY OUT

40
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,972
FORGET IT... BERNARDO.

41
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,891
YOU AIN'T GOING ANYWHERE.

42
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,186
NONE OF YOU ARE.

43
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,647
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO WITH US?

44
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,442
I WAS GOING TO LET YOU
THINK ABOUT THAT

45
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,193
FOR A LITTLE BIT.

46
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,696
NOW, EVERYBODY,
AGAINST THE WALL!

47
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,406
SIT DOWN
OVER THERE.

48
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,450
MOVE! MOVE IT!

49
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,077
IF ANY OF
THEM MOVES

50
00:01:58,077 --> 00:01:59,703
SHOOT THEM.

51
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:02,163
NO ONE'S SHOOTING ANYONE.

52
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,794
MAYBE... MAYBE NOT.

53
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:10,422
WE NEED THEM ALIVE.
THEY'RE THE ONLY THING
WE HAVE TO BARGAIN WITH.

54
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:11,882
THINK I DIDN'T KNOW THAT?

55
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:14,051
JUST MAKING SURE.

56
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,636
WE NEED TO GET
THESE BLINDS CLOSED.

57
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,471
THE POLICE WILL
DROP SNIPERS

58
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,222
ON THE ROOFS
AND PICK US OFF
ONE BY ONE.

59
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,017
ALL RIGHT. LET'S USE
THE BENCHES AS BARRICADES.

60
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:23,811
WE'LL STACK THEM UP
AGAINST THE WINDOWS.

61
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:32,027
IT'S TOO BAD.

62
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:34,696
I KIND OF LIKE WATCHING
THIS PLACE BURN.

63
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,074
DROP YOUR WEAPONS!

64
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:39,326
(<i> laughs</i> )

65
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:40,786
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

66
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:41,996
YOU.

67
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:43,538
YOU'RE DEAD.

68
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,541
(<i> yells</i> )

69
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,835
SHUT UP!

70
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,628
(<i> frantic screaming</i> )

71
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:51,421
I SAID, SHUT UP!

72
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,508
LEAVE HER ALONE.
SHE'S JUST SCARED.

73
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:55,926
LISTEN, CALM DOWN.

74
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:58,219
NO ONE'S GOING
TO HURT YOU.

75
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:04,434
NOW GET OVER THERE
WITH THE OTHERS.

76
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:07,228
I KNOW YOU. I PICKED
YOU UP THE OTHER DAY.

77
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,857
I KNOW. IT'S MY WAY
OF SAYING THANK YOU.

78
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:12,109
NOW GET OVER THERE
WITH THE OTHERS!

79
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:14,611
B.C.:
HEY, NICE TACKLE, BELL.

80
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,571
YOU EVER PLAY ANY FOOTBALL?

81
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,281
BASEBALL, ACTUALLY.

82
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,283
REALLY? I'D HATE TO BE A CATCHER

83
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,536
AND SEEN YOU BARRELLING
TOWARDS HOME PLATE.

84
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:25,998
HEY, YOU, GET UP.
GET ON YOUR FEET!

85
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:28,042
LEAVE HER ALONE.

86
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:29,626
OH, NICE MOUTH.

87
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,587
ALL RIGHT. YOU GET UP.

88
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:36,424
I SAID, GET UP!

89
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,093
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

90
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:39,636
I JUST WANT TO SEE

91
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,347
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING
ABOUT US ON THE NET.

92
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,224
I NEED HIS ACCESS
CODE TO LOG ON.

93
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,185
DON'T MAKE ME ASK YOU AGAIN.

94
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:48,562
GET LOST.

95
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:50,856
AFTER YOU.

96
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:52,482
Bernardo:
WAIT. I'LL DO IT.

97
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,609
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
SIT DOWN.

98
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,696
HEY, VIN, WE'RE NOT ON DUTY NOW

99
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,823
SO DON'T
GIVE ME ORDERS.

100
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,411
I JUST WANT TO MAKE IT HOME
IN ONE PIECE.

101
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,413
SMART BOY.

102
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,498
MOVE. GET BACK THERE.

103
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,260
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING.

104
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,597
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY
KEEPING THE HOSTAGES SAFE.

105
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,766
IT'S NOT JUST THEM
I'M WORRIED ABOUT

106
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,350
IT'S YOU.

107
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,436
DIDN'T YOU SAY
GABRIEL BELL DIED

108
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,687
WHEN THE POLICE

109
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,313
STORMED
THE BUILDING?

110
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,857
RIGHT, BUT I'M NOT BELL.

111
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:38,486
NO, BUT WE'RE THE ONLY
ONES WHO KNOW THAT.

112
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,733
Newscaster:

113
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,651
The National Guard is mobilizing

114
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,486
and should reach Sanctuary
District "A" within the hour.

115
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,114
Governor River stated that
the uprising will be quelled

116
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,908
and the district secured.

117
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:51,452
It's not clear how this
riot began, though rumors

118
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:54,539
and mounting tensions have been
filtering out of the district
for weeks.

119
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,957
THIS IS GREAT.

120
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,792
WE'RE ON EVERY CHANNEL.

121
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,961
I BET THEY'RE
WATCHING THIS IN CHINA.

122
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,089
WHY DO THEY
SOUNDS SO SURPRISED?

123
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:05,050
I MEAN, YOU TREAT
PEOPLE LIKE ANIMALS,
YOU'RE GOING TO GET BIT.

124
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,468
LET ME THROUGH.

125
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,721
HEY! WHO SAID YOU
COULD COME IN HERE?

126
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:10,972
IT'S OKAY. LET HIM IN.

127
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:11,932
KNOW THIS GIMMIE?

128
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,641
HE'S A FRIEND.

129
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,229
GO JOIN YOUR FRIENDS.

130
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,984
I'M GLAD TO SEE
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

131
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,737
SO MUCH FOR OUR
PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATION.

132
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:28,073
I KNOW IT'S NOT
WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT

133
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,033
BUT IT'S WHAT HAPPENED

134
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,035
AND NOW WE HAVE
TO DEAL WITH IT.

135
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,246
HOW? IT'S A MADHOUSE OUT THERE

136
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:37,040
AND THIS BUILDING IS
CRAWLING WITH GHOSTS.

137
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,584
THAT'S THE FIRST THING
WE HAVE TO FIX.

138
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:43,088
I WANT YOU TO GO OUT AND FIND
GIMMIES-- PEOPLE YOU KNOW

139
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:46,091
PEOPLE WHO CAN BE TRUSTED
TO GUARD THE HOSTAGES.

140
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,926
IF WE LEAVE IT TO THE GHOSTS

141
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,761
THERE'S NO TELLING
WHAT COULD HAPPEN.

142
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,179
I THINK I KNOW JUST
THE PEOPLE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

143
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:54,057
GOOD. WE'RE GOING TO NEED THEM.

144
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:57,352
HEY, BELL, YOU'RE MISSING
SOMETHING OVER HERE.

145
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:59,813
Newscaster:
Sanctuary residents have looted
the district's

146
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,023
food distribution centers,
and there are reports
of at least a dozen fires.

147
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,277
Many of the District
employees fleeing the riot
are reported injured

148
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:07,862
and several have yet
to be accounted for.

149
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,157
There's been no official
count of injuries among
Sancutary residents,

150
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:14,661
however satellite pictures
show a number of possible
casualties.

151
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:18,706
We'll have more on this story as
information becomes available.

152
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:19,958
THIS IS TERRIBLE.

153
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,085
I'VE GOT TO
GET DOWN THERE.

154
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,295
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

155
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,921
MY FRIENDS ARE IN THERE.

156
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,256
I KNOW
THEY ARE

157
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,133
BUT THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO.

158
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:29,968
I HAVE TO TRY.

159
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:32,304
JADZIA, YOU COULD GET HURT.

160
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:35,265
I CAN'T STAY HERE AND WATCH
THAT PLACE BURN KNOWING MY
FRIENDS ARE INSIDE.

161
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:38,143
LOOK. I HAVE FRIENDS
IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT.

162
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,312
WHEN THINGS SETTLE DOWN
A LITTLE BIT, I WILL
TALK TO THEM.

163
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:41,938
I CAN'T WAIT THAT LONG.

164
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,606
BY THE TIME THINGS SETTLE DOWN

165
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,860
MY FRIENDS COULD BE HURT
OR EVEN KILLED.

166
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,487
THEY DON'T BELONG IN THERE.

167
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:50,322
NONE OF THOSE PEOPLE DO.

176
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,682
TO THE NUMBER
OF CHRONITON PARTICLES

177
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:20,018
INTERACTING WITH
THE TRANSPORTER BEAM.

178
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,896
UNFORTUNATELY, THERE'S NO WAY TO
KNOW THE EXACT CONCENTRATION

179
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,647
OF PARTICLES AT
THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT

180
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,359
BUT I'VE NARROWED IT DOWN
TO TEN POSSIBILITIES

181
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:30,529
EACH ONE CORRESPONDING
WITH A DIFFERENT TIME FRAME.

182
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:32,197
ONE HAS TO BE RIGHT.

183
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,948
WE HOPE WE FIND
THE RIGHT ONE

184
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,659
BEFORE WE RUN OUT
OF CHRONITON PARTICLES.

185
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,124
I FEEL RIDICULOUS.

186
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:48,004
WELL, IT DOES EFFECTIVELY
DISGUISE YOUR BAJORAN HERITAGE.

187
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:51,550
JUST SAY
YOU BROKE YOUR NOSE.

188
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,301
ON THE OTHER HAND

189
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,720
MAYBE YOU BETTER SAY NOTHING.
I'LL DO THE TALKING.

190
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,972
THAT'S FINE WITH ME.

191
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,266
GOOD LUCK.

192
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,601
ENERGIZE.

193
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,280
O'Brien:
IF THIS IS WHERE
COMMANDER SISKO

194
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,406
AND THE OTHERS
MATERIALIZED

195
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:15,782
THERE SHOULD BE

196
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,992
A RESIDUAL
ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE.

197
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,911
KIRA TO SISKO.

198
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,498
KIRA TO DAX.

199
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,000
KIRA TO BASHIR.

200
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,586
JUDGING BY THIS VEHICLE

201
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:29,087
WE'RE IN
THE MID-20th CENTURY.

202
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,381
NO ONE'S RESPONDING
TO MY HAILS.

203
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:35,176
I'M NOT READING ANY
ELECTROSTATIC VARIANCE
OR DISTRESS SIGNALS.

204
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,803
THEY'RE DEFINITELY
NOT HERE.

205
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,597
HOW LONG BEFORE
THE TRANSPORTER REENGAGES?

206
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:41,141
ABOUT 30 SECONDS.

207
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:45,186
(<i> man humming</i>
<i>"Sweet Georgia Brown"</i> )

208
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:49,149
EVENING.

209
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,277
I... I BROKE MY NOSE.

210
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:59,409
I TOLD YOU NOT
TO SAY ANYTHING.

211
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,872
I'VE GOT ONE QUESTION
FOR YOU TWO:

212
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,707
WHAT ARE ALL THESE GIMMIES
DOING HERE?

213
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,960
I ASKED THEM TO HELP.

214
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,378
AND WHO INVITED YOU?

215
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,963
I DID.

216
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:13,923
LOOK, LAST TIME I CHECKED
THIS IS MY PARTY.

217
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:17,594
THAT MEANS I GET TO DECIDE WHO'S
ON THE GUEST LIST AND WHO ISN'T.

218
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,554
WE NEEDED PEOPLE WE COULD TRUST.

219
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:21,680
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

220
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,519
HOW MANY GHOSTS DO YOU KNOW
CAN YOU REALLY TRUST?

221
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,020
ONE.<i> ME.</i>

222
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,355
AND THAT'S ENOUGH.

223
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,607
NO, IT ISN'T.
NOT HERE, NOT NOW!

224
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,984
WE NEED PEOPLE TO
GUARD THE BUILDING

225
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,611
WATCH THE EXITS

226
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:35,862
KEEP AN EYE ON
THE HOSTAGES

227
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,239
WHEN WE NEED
TO SLEEP.

228
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,034
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
YOU MADE YOUR POINT.
JUST KEEP THEM OUT OF MY HAIR.

229
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,785
THE IMPORTANT THING TO DECIDE

230
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,413
IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO
WITH THOSE HOSTAGES.

231
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,290
I'VE GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT.

232
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,376
I BET YOU DO.

233
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,961
AND JUST TO PROVE
I'M NOT SUCH A BAD GUY

234
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,172
I'M GOING TO LET
YOU TWO IN ON IT.

235
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,008
IT'S SIMPLE.

236
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:59,718
WE TRADE THE HOSTAGES
FOR OUR FREEDOM.

237
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:02,847
WE GET AMNESTY,
A HANDFUL OF CREDIT CHIPS

238
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,392
AND A FLIGHT
TO ANYWHERE WE WANT.

239
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:08,144
PERSONALLY,
I'M THINKING TASMANIA.

240
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,898
TASMANIA...

241
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,483
ERROL FLYNN

242
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:16,110
WAS BORN IN TASMANIA!

243
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,945
LOOK, YOU GUYS GO WHERE
YOU WANT AND I'LL GO
WHERE I WANT, ALL RIGHT?

244
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,947
Webb:
YEAH, AND AS SOON AS WE STEP OFF

245
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,824
THE PLANE, THEY LOCK US UP.

246
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,285
BESIDES, WE JUST CAN'T
THINK ABOUT OURSELVES.

247
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,204
THERE ARE 10,000 PEOPLE HERE.

248
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:28,248
LET THEM GET THEIR OWN HOSTAGES.

249
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,166
Webb:
NO, GABE IS RIGHT.
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY

250
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,377
FOR US TO BE HEARD, TO LET
PEOPLE ON THE OUTSIDE KNOW

251
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,337
EXACTLY WHAT'S
GOING ON IN HERE.

252
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,506
YOU WANT TO
MAKE DEMANDS?

253
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,091
I'LL GIVE YOU DEMANDS.

254
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,758
WE TELL THEM IF
THEY WANT THE HOSTAGES

255
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:41,802
THEY'VE GOT TO SHUT DOWN
THE SANCTUARIES.

256
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,638
AND REINSTATE
THE FEDERAL EMPLOYMENT ACT.

257
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:46,600
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE THEM THROW IN
A COUPLE OF SILK SHIRTS

258
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,269
MAYBE A PENTHOUSE IN SINGAPORE?

259
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:53,064
JOBS? YOU GUYS WANT JOBS?

260
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,733
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO GET IT?

261
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:56,526
THERE ARE NO JOBS.

262
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,194
NOT FOR US, ANYWAY.

263
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,946
THEY'LL FIND JOBS.

264
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,822
THEY'LL HAVE TO.

265
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:05,493
AFTER TONIGHT, THEY WON'T
BE ABLE TO IGNORE US ANYMORE.

266
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:09,830
ALL RIGHT. WE'LL DO IT YOUR WAY.

267
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,709
I'LL LOG ON THE INTERFACE
AND I'LL TELL THEM

268
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,835
THAT WE WANT
THE DISTRICT CLOSED.

269
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,879
NOT YOU, HIM.

270
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:24,887
UH, FUNNY, I... I
WOULD HAVE NOMINATED YOU.

271
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,681
WHAT?

272
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:29,016
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG
WITH ME?

273
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,519
I COULD BE AS ELOQUENT
AS THE NEXT GUY.

274
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,771
I'M SURE YOU CAN

275
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:34,689
BUT THEY CAN'T DISMISS WEBB

276
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,524
AS EASILY AS YOU OR ME.

277
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:39,486
HE'S GOT THE FACE,
HE'S GOT THE FAMILY.

278
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,112
HE'S THE GUY NEXT DOOR.

279
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,822
AND<i> THAT'S</i> WHAT
THEY NEED TO SEE.

280
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:59,756
MY NAME IS MICHAEL WEBB.

281
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:04,636
I USED TO BE A PLANT MANAGER
AT CHEMTECH INDUSTRIES.

282
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:10,224
I'M SPEAKING FOR THE RESIDENTS
OF SANCTUARY DISTRICT "A."

283
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,602
WE ARE HOLDING SIX HOSTAGES.

284
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:15,854
WE DON'T WANT TO HURT THEM.

285
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:18,399
ALL WE WANT IS...

286
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,984
WHAT HAPPENED?

287
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,862
SOMEONE'S CUT OFF
OUR ACCESS TO THE INTERFACE.

288
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,323
I KNEW THIS WAS A WASTE OF TIME.

289
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:26,700
THEY DON'T CARE.

290
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,242
NO ONE CARES
ABOUT US.

291
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,994
WHY SHOULD THEY?

292
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,830
YOU'RE ALL
A BUNCH OF LOSERS.

293
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:35,500
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

294
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,043
HE DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING.

295
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:40,505
YOU HEARD ME.
I CALLED YOU A LOSER

296
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,089
'CAUSE THAT'S
WHAT YOU ARE

297
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,551
AND THIS TIME,
YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE BIG.

298
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,344
THAT'S ENOUGH!

299
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,599
AND CHECK YOUR E-MAIL, BUDDY.
YOU'RE A LOSER TOO.

300
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,309
Bashir:
IF YOU WANT

301
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,102
TO GET OUT OF HERE,
YOU BETTER HOPE YOU'RE WRONG.

302
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,605
QUIET DOWN, VIN. YOU'LL
ONLY MAKE THINGS WORSE.

303
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,441
I WANT THESE GUYS TO KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE IN FOR.

304
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,694
I BET THE NATIONAL GUARD
ALREADY HAS THIS
PLACE SURROUNDED.

305
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:05,071
SOONER OR LATER,
THEY'LL COME ROLLING
RIGHT IN

306
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,741
AND YOU PEOPLE AREN'T EVEN
GOING TO SLOW THEM DOWN.

307
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:13,788
I REALLY THINK
WE SHOULD KILL
THIS GUY.

308
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,790
(<i> beeping</i> )

309
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,292
MR. WEBB, I'M DETECTIVE PRESTON,
S.F.P.D.

310
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,294
It's urgent that I speak to you.

311
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:23,297
DID YOU SHUT OFF OUR ACCESS
TO THE INTERFACE?

312
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:27,093
I'M AFRAID IT'S DEPARTMENT
POLICY IN THESE TYPES
OF SITUATIONS

313
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,970
but it does give us
a chance to talk one-on-one.

314
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:34,475
ALL RIGHT. LET'S TALK.

315
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,644
FIRST, I WANT
TO SEE THE HOSTAGES.

316
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,148
WHAT FOR?

317
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:43,984
I NEED TO MAKE SURE
THEY'RE OKAY.

318
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,487
YOU SAID YOU WEREN'T
GOING TO HURT THEM.

319
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:49,282
I need to know
I can count on that.

320
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,700
THEY WANT TO SEE
A HOSTAGE?

321
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,619
LET'S SHOW THEM
A HOSTAGE.

322
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,287
TAKE A GOOD LOOK, LADY.

323
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,623
I got five more just like her

324
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,708
AND IF WE DON'T
GET WHAT WE WANT

325
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,043
THEY'RE GOING
TO GET HURT.

326
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,924
I THINK YOU'VE
MADE YOUR POINT.

327
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:08,259
HAVE I,
DETECTIVE?

328
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,427
I'D SAY SO.

329
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:10,678
B.C.:
Good.

330
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,180
LOOK, IF YOU DON'T MIND

331
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,349
I'D LIKE TO SPEAK
WITH MR. WEBB AGAIN.

332
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,351
WHY WOULD
I MIND?

333
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,186
ALL RIGHT, DETECTIVE,
I'M HERE.

334
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,397
YOUR FRIEND HAS QUITE A TEMPER.

335
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:26,110
THAT'S BECAUSE HE'S ANGRY.

336
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,487
WE ALL ARE.

337
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,281
B.C., LET ME
ASK YOU SOMETHING.

338
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:31,866
GO AHEAD.

339
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:33,409
WHY DO I GET
THE FEELING

340
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,202
THAT YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO BE HAPPY

341
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:38,289
UNTIL YOU'VE HURT ONE
OF THOSE HOSTAGES?

342
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:39,666
I HAVE TO ADMIT

343
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,918
THE THOUGHT HAS
CROSSED MY MIND.

344
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,252
IT MIGHT ALLEVIATE

345
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,505
SOME OF THE STRESS
I'M FEELING.

346
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,966
I THINK YOU'D
BETTER FIND A WAY

347
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:50,176
TO DEAL WITH
THAT STRESS.

348
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,345
IT'S SURE TO BE A LOT
HEALTHIER FOR YOU

349
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,555
IN THE LONG RUN.

350
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,474
NO KIDDING.

351
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:59,560
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

352
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,396
YOU THINK IT LOOKS
BETTER LIKE THIS

353
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,609
OR LIKE THIS?

354
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,695
IT'S YOUR HEAD...

355
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:12,740
AND YOUR DECISION.

356
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,994
GABE, DETECTIVE PRESTON
WANTS TO MEET WITH ME.

357
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:17,161
WHEN?

358
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,872
NOW, BY THE MAIN GATE.

359
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:20,080
MAY I JOIN YOU?

360
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,958
I WAS HOPING
YOU'D SAY THAT.

361
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,877
KEEP AN EYE
ON THE HOSTAGES.

362
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:25,044
GOT IT.

363
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,587
GOOD LUCK.

364
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:30,341
IT'S BEEN A LONG NIGHT.
FOR ALL OF US.

365
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:32,218
YOU GUYS MUST
BE EXHAUSTED.

366
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,470
Webb:
WE'RE OKAY.

367
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,973
WE COULD USE SOME BREAKFAST
COME MORNING.

368
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:38,432
BREAKFAST
FOR 10,000?

369
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,226
THAT'S A LOT OF TAKE-OUT

370
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,436
BUT IN THE INTEREST
OF FRIENDSHIP

371
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:45,523
I'LL DO WHAT I CAN.

372
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,025
NOW, HOW ABOUT
RETURNING THE FAVOR

373
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:49,443
AND LETTING ME HAVE
ONE OF THE HOSTAGES?

374
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,945
NO HOSTAGE, NO FOOD--

375
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,405
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING?

376
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:53,698
NOT AT ALL.

377
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,700
YOU'LL GET THE FOOD EITHER WAY.

378
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,786
GIVING UP ONE OF THE HOSTAGES
WOULD SHOW GOOD FAITH.

379
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:02,164
BESIDES, YOU'D STILL HAVE

380
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,917
FIVE LEFT.

381
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:06,335
THOSE HOSTAGES
AREN'T GOING ANYWHERE

382
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,921
UNTIL WE GET WHAT WE WANT.

383
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,213
WHICH IS WHAT?

384
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,840
WE WANT
THE SANCTUARIES CLOSED

385
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,926
AND THE FEDERAL
EMPLOYMENT ACT REINSTATED.

386
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,054
THAT'S ASKING A LOT.

387
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:17,847
I DON'T THINK SO.

388
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:20,558
WHAT WE WANT IS TO GET OUT
FROM BEHIND THESE WALLS--

389
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,977
TO STOP HAVING TO
DEPEND ON HANDOUTS.

390
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:27,648
THAT'S RIGHT. ALL WE'RE
ASKING FOR IS A CHANCE TO
GET BACK ON OUR FEET AGAIN.

391
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,317
WE DON'T DESERVE
TO BE LOCKED UP IN HERE.

392
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,114
OBVIOUSLY, I CAN'T
MAKE ANY PROMISES

393
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:39,159
BUT I WILL SEE TO IT
THE GOVERNOR HEARS YOUR DEMANDS.

394
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,995
YOU DO THAT.

395
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,219
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

396
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,097
Vin:
HEY!

397
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:00,180
LEAVE HER ALONE.

398
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,058
I'M A DOCTOR.

399
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,935
SURE YOU ARE.

400
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:09,107
YOU WERE HERE THE OTHER DAY,
WEREN'T YOU?

401
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:12,359
THAT'S RIGHT.

402
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,070
ARE YOU
HYPOGLYCEMIC?

403
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,364
YOU REALLY ARE A DOCTOR.

404
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,867
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL SOMEONE?

405
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,120
I WAS AFRAID TO.

406
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,664
I'LL SEE ABOUT GETTING
YOU SOME MEDICINE.

407
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:28,417
IN THE MEANTIME I'LL
TRY AND FIND YOU A
CHOCOLATE BAR OR SOMETHING.

408
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:37,718
HE WAS HERE WITH YOU,
WASN'T HE?

409
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,219
BELL?

410
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,055
WE CAME IN TOGETHER.

411
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:43,599
HE GAVE ME A FALSE NAME,
DIDN'T HE?

412
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,185
WELL...

413
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,603
YES.

414
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,522
HE GOT INTO
A LITTLE TROUBLE

415
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,190
A WHILE BACK

416
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,567
AND UM... DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO PUT HIS REAL NAME

417
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:54,944
ON THE COMPUTER.

418
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,323
WHEN I FIRST STARTED
WORKING HERE

419
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:06,164
I PROCESSED A WOMAN
WHO HAD A WARRANT OUT ON HER

420
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:07,832
FOR ABANDONING HER KID.

421
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,585
SHE COULDN'T TAKE CARE OF HIM

422
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:17,257
SO SHE LEFT HIM WITH A FAMILY
THAT SHE WORKED FOR

423
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,093
OVER IN THE MARINA.

424
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,597
I FELT SO SORRY FOR HER.

425
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:28,561
I DIDN'T LOG HER IN.

426
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,605
I JUST LET HER DISAPPEAR
INTO THE SANCTUARY.

427
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:35,234
WELL, THAT WAS VERY KIND OF YOU.

428
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:39,572
ALMOST GOT ME FIRED
WHEN MY SUPERVISOR FOUND OUT.

429
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,699
WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS WOMAN?

430
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,869
I DON'T KNOW.

431
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,165
BUT I THINK ABOUT HER
ALL THE TIME.

432
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:58,507
EVER SINCE THEN I'VE JUST
DONE MY JOB, YOU KNOW.

433
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,718
TRIED NOT TO LET IT
GET THE BEST OF ME.

434
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:06,849
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT THAT
THINGS ARE THE WAY THEY ARE.

435
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:13,189
EVERYBODY TELLS THEMSELVES THAT

436
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:17,902
AND NOTHING EVER CHANGES.

GIVE ME ONE REASON WHY NOT.

441
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,765
ALL RIGHT.

442
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:56,649
YOU REALLY GOING TO
SHOOT ME, BELL?

443
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,234
I DON'T THINK SO.

444
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,653
THINK AGAIN.

445
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,989
I THOUGHT WE WERE ON
THE SAME SIDE HERE!

TO ME CLOSELY

GOING TO SAY THIS AGAIN.

THAT I FEEL FOR THEM?
THAT THEY GOT A BAD BREAK?

00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:33,967
SO DO I.

526
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,386
Preston:
THE GOVERNOR ASSURES ME

527
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:37,221
THAT IF YOU LET
THE HOSTAGES GO

528
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:39,139
HE'LL REDUCE THE CHARGES
AGAINST YOU

529
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,807
TO INCITEMENT
TO RIOT.

530
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:45,020
THAT'S IT? WHAT ABOUT
CLOSING THE SANCTUARY?

531
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,397
WHAT ABOUT JOBS?

532
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:48,357
THE GOVERNOR WILL
FORM A COMMITTEE

533
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:50,650
TO LOOK INTO THE PROBLEMS
FACING THE DISTRICT RESIDENTS.

534
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:54,696
SO YOU'RE TELLING US
THAT NOTHING IS GOING TO CHANGE.

535
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,782
I WOULDN'T SAY THAT

536
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,742
BUT CHANGE TAKES TIME.

537
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:00,702
YOU'VE RUN OUT OF TIME.

538
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,662
GENTLEMEN...

539
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:04,248
IF I WERE YOU

540
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:06,708
I WOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER
TAKING THIS OFFER.

541
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,002
OR ELSE WHAT?

542
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,004
THE GOVERNOR IS NOT GOING
TO LET THIS SITUATION

543
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:13,215
CONTINUE FOREVER.

544
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:20,013
YOU TELL HIM IF HE WANTS
TO SEE THOSE HOSTAGES AGAIN

545
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:22,182
HE'S GOING TO HAVE
TO DO BETTER.

546
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,275
TOUGH TALK.

547
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:32,859
I WAS BLUFFING.

548
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,278
I COULDN'T TELL.

549
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:37,239
I HOPE SHE
COULDN'T EITHER.

550
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:18,113
Sisko:
TRY OPENING THAT MENU.

551
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:22,326
IT JUST BRINGS ME BACK
TO THE SAME SCREEN.

552
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:24,244
THERE DOESN'T SEEM
TO BE ANY WAY

553
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,412
OF GETTING PAST THE LOCKOUT
AND LOGGING ONTO THE NET.

554
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:26,830
THERE<i> HAS</i> TO BE.

555
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,666
HOW CAN YOU
BE CERTAIN?

556
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:30,250
BECAUSE ACCORDING TO HISTORY

557
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,085
THE RESIDENTS
WERE ABLE TO GET
ONTO THE NET

558
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,046
AND TELL THEIR SIDE
OF THE STORY.

559
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:35,797
MILLIONS OF
PEOPLE WATCHED.

560
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:38,258
WELL, NO ONE
HERE'S BEEN ABLE

561
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,427
TO GET PAST
THE LOCKOUT.

562
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,054
MAYBE IT WAS BELL.

563
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:44,139
AND IF HE DID IT,
WE HAVE TO ALSO.

564
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,308
B.C.:
HEY, LISTEN UP,
EVERYBODY.

565
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:48,727
A COUPLE OF DIMS JUST BROUGHT US
A LITTLE PRESENT.

566
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:03,950
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU FELLAS,
BUT I'M IN LOVE.

567
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,160
JADZIA...

568
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,370
YOU KNOW HER?

569
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,913
JULIAN.

570
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:13,043
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?
THAT'S THE STORY OF MY LIFE.

571
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:15,170
ALL THE GOOD ONES
ARE TAKEN.

572
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,256
YOU REMEMBER
MY FRIEND GABE.

573
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,966
GABRIEL BELL.
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

574
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,719
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

575
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:24,430
ALLOW ME TO
INTRODUCE MYSELF.

576
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,014
BIDDLE COLERIDGE.

577
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,015
BIDDLE?

578
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,517
HEY!

579
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:30,728
I DIDN'T SAY A WORD.

580
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:32,938
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
ALL OVER FOR YOU.

581
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:34,690
Webb:
EXCUSE ME.

582
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:39,612
YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T LIVE HERE,
SO HOW DID YOU GET IN?

583
00:29:39,612 --> 00:29:41,655
I MANAGED TO RE-CODE
MY I.D. CARD

584
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:43,073
SO I COULD GET PAST

585
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:45,242
THE SANITATION
DEPARTMENT CHECKPOINT.

586
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:49,121
YOU CRAWLED IN
THROUGH THE SEWERS?

587
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,582
YOU MUST REALLY
LIKE THESE GUYS.

588
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:54,334
YOU SHOULD, UH, SIT DOWN.

589
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,295
YOU MUST BE
EXHAUSTED.

590
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:04,344
IT'S TOO BAD.

591
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,763
I THINK ME AND HER

592
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:08,766
COULD HAVE HAD
SOMETHING SPECIAL.

593
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:10,225
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS
EVEN IF I COULD GET YOU OUT

594
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:12,269
YOU WOULDN'T LEAVE.

595
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:15,230
THOSE HOSTAGES
HAVE TO BE PROTECTED,
WHATEVER THE COST.

596
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,442
YOU SAID THAT ONE OF THE MEN
WHO BROUGHT YOU HERE TOOK YOUR
COMBADGE?

597
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:21,987
THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S SET TO EMIT
A SUBSPACE DISTRESS SIGNAL.

598
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,823
JULIAN, I WANT YOU
TO HELP DAX FIND THE MEN

599
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,366
WHO TOOK
HER COMBADGE

600
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,702
AND THEN I WANT BOTH OF YOU
GET AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.

601
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:32,956
BUT IF THE<i> DEFIANT</i> LOCKS ON
TO MY DISTRESS SIGNAL AND WE'RE
NOT TOGETHER--

602
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:35,083
AS SOON AS THE HOSTAGES
ARE IN POLICE CUSTODY

603
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,711
I'LL TRY TO MAKE IT BACK
TO THE BEAM-IN SITE.

604
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:42,048
IF FOR SOME REASON
I CAN'T MAKE IT, YOU'LL HAVE
TO LEAVE WITHOUT ME.

605
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,092
Bashir:
SIR...

606
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,512
OBVIOUSLY,
JADZIA HAS GOT TO LEAVE.

607
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:48,472
IF SOMETHING WERE
TO HAPPEN TO HER

608
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:51,725
IT WOULDN'T TAKE A DOCTOR LONG
TO FIGURE OUT SHE WASN'T HUMAN.

609
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:55,312
BUT YOU'LL STILL NEED HELP
TO KEEP THOSE HOSTAGES ALIVE

610
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:58,482
AND IF IT'S ALL THE SAME
WITH YOU, I'LL STAY.

611
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,819
ALL RIGHT.

612
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:04,154
SEE IF YOU CAN GET
HER COMBADGE BACK.

613
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:07,199
I'LL KEEP TRYING
TO LOG ONTO THE NET.

614
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,246
THE POLICE CUT OFF
OUR ACCESS.

615
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:16,124
THAT'S ONE PROBLEM
I MIGHT BE ABLE
TO HELP YOU WITH.

616
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:26,510
Bashir:
DO YOU REALLY THINK

617
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,178
YOU CAN CONVINCE YOUR FRIEND
TO PUT US ON THE NET?

618
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:30,096
IT'LL TAKE
SOME PERSUADING

619
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:31,765
BUT I THINK HE'LL DO
WHAT'S RIGHT.

620
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:34,852
THIS IS IT.?
THE MEN WHO TOOK
MY COMBADGE

621
00:31:34,852 --> 00:31:38,230
BROUGHT ME HERE
BEFORE THEY TOOK ME TO
THE PROCESSING CENTER.

622
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,743
HELLO?

623
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:55,247
HELLO?

624
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:57,541
Man:
THERE'S
NOBODY HERE.

625
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,715
WE JUST WANT TO TALK.

626
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,726
WHOOSH.

627
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,562
I'M INVISIBLE.

628
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:22,065
IF YOU SAY SO.

629
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:28,697
YOU CAN SEE ME?

630
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:31,742
JUST... BARELY.

631
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:35,036
THAT'S OKAY.

632
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,747
AS LONG AS THEY CAN'T SEE ME.

633
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:40,041
WHO?

634
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,043
THE ALIENS.

635
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,546
THEY'LL SUCK YOUR BRAINS OUT
RIGHT THROUGH YOUR EARS.

636
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:46,256
I KNOW.

637
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:49,301
YOU SEE, I'M AN ALIEN.

638
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:52,429
I THOUGHT SO...

639
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:54,389
BUT YOU'RE A GOOD ALIEN.

640
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,516
RIGHT. I'M HERE
TO PROTECT

641
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,351
THE EARTH FROM ITS ENEMIES

642
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:02,940
BUT I NEED THAT PIECE OF JEWELRY
YOU'RE HOLDING TO DO IT.

643
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,024
I UNDERSTAND.
HERE, YOU TAKE IT.

644
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,236
GOOD LUCK.

645
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,113
THANK YOU.

646
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:12,991
SHH, DON'T TELL ANYONE.

647
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,952
I WON'T, I WON'T.

648
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,010
I CAME IN THERE.

649
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,309
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

650
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:42,354
WE'LL SEE YOU AT
THE BEAM-IN SITE.

651
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,403
LET ME SEE IF I UNDERSTAND

652
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,364
WHAT YOU'RE ASKING ME TO DO.

653
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:54,783
YOU WANT ME TO OVERRIDE
A GOVERNMENT BLOCK

654
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:56,368
VIOLATE MY INTERFACE

655
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:57,661
OPERATING LICENSE,
AND TURN OVER MY CHANNELS

656
00:33:57,661 --> 00:33:59,037
TO A BUNCH OF CRIMINALS.

657
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,789
THEY'RE NOT CRIMINALS.

658
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:02,875
I KNOW THAT.
BUT THEY ARE<i> ACTING</i>
<i>LIKE CRIMINALS.</i>

659
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:04,626
THEY HAVE GUNS,
THEY HAVE TAKEN HOSTAGES...

660
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:07,212
SO WHY DO<i> YOU</i> THINK
THEY'RE DOING IT?

661
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:08,797
DON'T YOU WANT TO KNOW?

662
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,924
DON'T YOU THINK THE PUBLIC
DESERVES TO KNOW?

663
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:16,555
YOU ARE ASKING ME
TO BREAK THE LAW.

664
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:19,975
I AM ASKING YOU
TO GIVE THOSE PEOPLE A VOICE.

665
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:21,810
CHRIS, SOONER OR LATER

666
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,103
THE GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO
RETAKE THE SANCTUARY DISTRICT

667
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:27,607
AND WHEN THEY DO, A LOT
OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DIE.

668
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,776
AND UNLESS THE PUBLIC LEARNS

669
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:32,487
WHY THE SANCTUARY RESIDENTS
DID WHAT THEY DID

670
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:35,782
ALL THOSE DEATHS
WILL BE FOR NOTHING.

671
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,910
YOU KNOW I'LL LOSE MY LICENSE.

672
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,163
BUT I'LL GET GREAT RATINGS.

673
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,545
MY NAME IS HENRY GARCIA.

674
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:50,923
I'VE BEEN LIVING HERE
TWO YEARS NOW.

675
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:54,509
I CAME TO SAN FRANCISCO
TO WORK IN A BREWERY

676
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,970
BUT THEY LAID A BUNCH OF US OFF

677
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:59,180
BECAUSE THEY GOT SOME
NEW EQUIPMENT, AND...

678
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:02,308
SO I ENDED UP HERE.

679
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:05,270
I'VE NEVER BEEN IN TROUBLE
WITH THE LAW OR ANYTHING.

680
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,522
I DON'T WANT TO HURT ANYBODY.

681
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:11,526
I JUST WANT A CHANCE TO WORK
AND TO LIVE LIKE REGULAR PEOPLE.

682
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:21,828
Preston:
GOVERNOR, I UNDERSTAND
YOUR CONCERN

683
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:25,832
BUT I THINK THE USE OF FORCE
WOULD BE PREMATURE AT THIS TIME.

684
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:28,752
I<i> AM</i> AWARE THAT THERE
HAVE BEEN DISTURBANCES

685
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:30,712
IN OTHER SANCTUARY DISTRICTS

686
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:33,298
BUT WE HAVE TO THINK
ABOUT THE HOSTAGES.

687
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:35,592
I KNOW, I'VE HEARD
THE RUMORS TOO.

688
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:38,011
THAT... THAT'S ALL
THEY ARE, RUMORS.

689
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:40,722
IF YOU JUST GIVE ME
ANOTHER CHANCE

690
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:43,058
TO TALK WITH WEBB
AND BELL, I...

691
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,310
YES, SIR.

692
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,480
OF COURSE.

693
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,065
WE'LL DO OUR BEST.

694
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:56,362
THE GOVERNOR'S
MADE UP HIS MIND.

695
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,490
WE MOVE IN AT 0500.

696
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:14,840
NO LUCK?

697
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,926
I'M AFRAID NOT.

698
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:19,886
WELL, WE KNOW ONE THING.

699
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,805
THEY ARRIVED
BEFORE THE YEAR 2048.

700
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:23,306
HOW CAN YOU BE SURE?

701
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:24,850
BECAUSE WE WERE
JUST THERE.

702
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,768
IT'S NOTHING LIKE
THE MID-21st CENTURY

703
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:29,771
I READ ABOUT IN SCHOOL.
IT'S BEEN CHANGED.

704
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:32,357
I MEAN, EARTH HISTORY
HAS BEEN THROUGH
ITS ROUGH PATCHES

705
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:33,900
BUT NEVER<i> THAT</i> ROUGH.

706
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,862
IF WE LIMIT OUR SEARCH
TO DATES BEFORE 2048

707
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:38,446
HOW MANY POSSIBILITIES

708
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:39,906
DOES THAT
LEAVE US?

709
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,575
ACCORDING TO MY
CALCULATIONS, THREE.

710
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:45,954
BUT WE ONLY HAVE ENOUGH
CHRONITON PARTICLES

711
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:47,956
FOR ONE MORE TRY.

712
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:50,333
WELL, PICK ONE, CHIEF.

713
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,669
LET'S HOPE
YOU GET LUCKY.

714
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,256
THAT'S MY BEST GUESS.

715
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:59,551
THAT'S GOOD
ENOUGH FOR ME.

716
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:02,846
ENERGIZE.

717
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:15,358
KIRA TO SISKO.

718
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:18,070
I'M PICKING UP A COMBADGE
DISTRESS SIGNAL.

719
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,696
IT'S DAX!

720
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:21,073
KIRA TO DAX.

721
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:22,782
Dax, do you hear me?

722
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,159
KIRA!

723
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:26,036
Dax, am I glad
to hear your voice.

724
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:27,662
WHERE ARE YOU?

725
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:30,415
O'Brien:
At the corner
of Polk and California.

726
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,000
I'LL MEET YOU THERE.

727
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,252
Kira:
Are Sisko and Bashir with you?

728
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,421
NO. I'LL EXPLAIN WHEN I SEE YOU.

729
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,965
THE TRANSPORTER IS
SET TO AUTOMATICALLY

730
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,759
RETRIEVE US
IN ABOUT A MINUTE.

731
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,343
DEACTIVATE
YOUR COMBADGE.

732
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,303
WE CAN REACTIVATE
THEM TOMORROW

733
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:46,139
IN TIME FOR
THE NEXT BEAM-OUT.

734
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:47,724
SHOULD BE
INTERESTING.

735
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:50,560
Vin:
BEST BALL CLUB I EVER SAW?

736
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,562
'99 YANKEES,
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

737
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:55,440
THE '15 KINGS COULD
HAVE TAKEN THEM ANY DAY.

738
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,858
AM I RIGHT?

739
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:58,818
I WOULDN'T KNOW.
I PREFER TENNIS.

740
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:00,237
TENNIS?

741
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,532
SOCCER.

742
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,659
IT'S UP TO YOU, BELL.

743
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:09,621
I DON'T THINK THERE'S
ANY QUESTION-- THE KINGS.

744
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:12,165
'15 WAS BUCK BOKAI'S
ROOKIE YEAR.

745
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:15,043
THAT'S ALL THEY HAD
GOING FOR THEM.

746
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:16,962
I'VE BEEN UP ON THE ROOF.

747
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:20,006
IT LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER
NATIONAL GUARD UNIT ARRIVED.

748
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,134
THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON
OUT THERE.

749
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:24,052
EVERYBODY
ON YOUR FEET.

750
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:25,262
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

751
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:27,097
THEY'LL BE SAFER
IN THERE.

752
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:28,723
LET'S GO!

753
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,940
I WANT YOU IN
THERE WITH THEM.

754
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,067
MAKE SURE THEY KEEP
THEIR HEADS DOWN.

755
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:42,654
I'LL SEE IF I CAN FIND
SOMETHING TO BLOCK THE DOOR.

756
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:50,162
DANNY... DANNY, WAKE UP.

757
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:51,871
COME ON.

758
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,873
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

759
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,084
DAD, I WANT TO BE
HERE WITH YOU.

760
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:58,336
I'LL MEET UP
WITH YOU LATER.

761
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:03,175
TELL YOUR MOM I LOVE HER.

762
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:05,760
AND GIVE YOUR SISTER A KISS
FOR ME, HUH?

763
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,514
GO ON, NOW.

764
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,432
GO ON.

765
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:18,815
HEY, KID...

766
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:26,072
YEAH, I THOUGHT SO.

767
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,866
LOOKS GOOD ON YOU.

768
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:30,618
NOW GET LOST.

769
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,583
WHAT THE HELL.

770
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:41,004
IT'S PROBABLY RAINING
IN TASMANIA ANYWAY.

771
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:47,344
I'M GOING TO CALL PRESTON
AND FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON.

772
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:51,597
(<i> whirring</i> )

773
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:56,728
(<i> helicopters approaching</i> )

774
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,396
OH, MY GOD.

775
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,917
(<i> groans</i> )

776
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,459
STOP SHOOTING, DAMMIT!

777
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:21,669
WE'RE OKAY!

778
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:23,629
NO!

779
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,631
(<i> shot</i> )

780
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:27,175
BELL!

781
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:31,721
FREEZE!

782
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:32,889
I'M A HOSTAGE

783
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:34,849
YOU IDIOT!

784
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:37,269
BLUE LEADER,
THE PROCESSING CENTER IS SECURE.

785
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:39,312
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU PEOPLE?

786
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:41,356
YOU COULD HAVE GOTTEN US
ALL KILLED.

787
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:43,066
THERE WERE RUMORS
YOU<i> WERE</i> DEAD.

788
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:44,609
DO I LOOK DEAD TO YOU?

789
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:47,362
OUR ORDERS WERE
TO PACIFY THE BUILDING.

790
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:49,155
YEAH...

791
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:51,199
WELL, YOU CERTAINLY DID
A GOOD JOB.

792
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,951
Bashir:
I'M A DOCTOR.

793
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,327
LEAVE HIM ALONE.

794
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:56,288
Man:
I COPY.

795
00:40:56,288 --> 00:40:58,873
ALL RIGHT LISTEN UP, THERE'S
TROUBLE ON SECOND STREET.

796
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:01,000
Vin:
YOU GO PACIFY
SECOND STREET.

797
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,710
OFFICER CALVERA AND I
CAN HANDLE THINGS HERE.

798
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,587
GIVE ME THAT.

799
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,091
ALL RIGHT MEN, LET'S MOVE!

800
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,053
HOW IS HE?

801
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:15,473
LUCKY. HE'LL LIVE.

802
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,393
THE NEXT TIME I TELL
YOU TO STAY DOWN, YOU...

803
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:19,936
GOTCHA.

804
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:21,354
YEAH.

805
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:22,855
WHAT ABOUT WEBB?

806
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:06,941
HOW COULD WE HAVE
LET THIS HAPPEN?

807
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:12,613
THE QUESTION IS, HOW DO WE
STOP IT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN?

808
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:23,082
SO WHAT DO WE
DO WITH THEM?

809
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:26,752
I DON'T KNOW.

810
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,421
YOU COULD LET US GO.

811
00:42:31,341 --> 00:42:32,384
ALL RIGHT.

812
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:33,718
VIN!

813
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:34,760
THEY SAVED OUR LIVES
BACK THERE.

814
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,970
HOW CAN WE EXPLAIN

815
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,597
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THEM?

816
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:40,308
GIVE ME YOUR I.D. CARDS.

817
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:43,353
POCKET.

818
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:51,110
WE'LL SWITCH THESE
FOR TWO OF THE CASUALTIES.

819
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,779
AS FAR AS
ANYBODY KNOWS...

820
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:57,242
YOU BOTH DIED HERE.

821
00:42:57,242 --> 00:42:58,993
IS THAT OKAY
WITH YOU, BELL?

822
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,953
THANKS.

823
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:03,081
MY PLEASURE.

824
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:04,790
COME ON.

825
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,918
LET'S GET YOU
OUT OF HERE.

826
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:09,170
ANYTHING ELSE
WE CAN DO FOR YOU?

827
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,922
THERE IS ONE
MORE THING.

828
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:12,798
Vin:
NAME IT.

829
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:16,302
Sisko:
TELL PEOPLE THE TRUTH
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

830
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,679
Vin:
WOULD HAVE DONE THAT ANYWAY.

831
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,398
Kira:
<i>FIRST OFFICER'S LOG,</i>
<i>SUPPLEMENTAL.</i>

832
00:43:28,398 --> 00:43:32,277
<i>UPON RETURNING TO THE PRESENT,</i>
<i>WE WERE RELIEVED TO DISCOVER</i>

833
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:34,862
<i>THAT THE TIMELINE</i>
<i>HAD BEEN RESTORED.</i>

834
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,655
(<i> door chimes</i> )

835
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:38,366
COME IN.

836
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,583
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

837
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:48,418
BETTER.

838
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:51,003
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
LIKE TO SEE THIS.

839
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:53,631
I FOUND IT IN
THE HISTORICAL DATABASE.

840
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:02,348
I'M NOT LOOKING
FORWARD

841
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:04,517
TO EXPLAINING THIS
TO STARFLEET COMMAND.

842
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:08,104
WELL, AT LEAST
IT'S A GOOD PICTURE.

843
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:09,647
YOU KNOW, COMMANDER

844
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,732
HAVING SEEN A LITTLE
OF THE 21st CENTURY

845
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:14,235
THERE IS ONE THING
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

846
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:18,239
HOW COULD THEY HAVE
LET THINGS GET SO BAD?

847
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:20,408
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

848
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:25,413
I WISH I HAD AN ANSWER.
