1
00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:09,180
I'm not what a lot of people
think.

2
00:00:09,214 --> 00:00:11,515
I mean, if you're a dabo girl

3
00:00:11,552 --> 00:00:14,023
you know, you get a reputation.

4
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:16,530
Miss Sarda, why don't you
tell me exactly what happened.

5
00:00:16,564 --> 00:00:19,435
When did you start
to have trouble with Quark?

6
00:00:19,471 --> 00:00:22,069
About five minutes
after I got off the ship.

7
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:23,945
He immediately made
sexual advances?

8
00:00:23,983 --> 00:00:26,216
He said it was part of the job.

9
00:00:26,255 --> 00:00:27,884
And what did you say?

10
00:00:27,925 --> 00:00:31,730
I told him I'd wear the costume
and entertain the gamblers

11
00:00:31,767 --> 00:00:34,238
but to keep his Ferengi
knuckles to himself.

12
00:00:34,307 --> 00:00:35,571
That didn't stop him?

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,877
No. He said again that
it was part of the job.

14
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:40,650
He showed me
my employment agreement.

15
00:00:40,689 --> 00:00:43,389
See, there it is
in the Ferengi print...

16
00:00:43,429 --> 00:00:46,561
page 21, subsection D,
paragraph 12.

17
00:00:47,806 --> 00:00:51,508
You're telling me the contract
you signed requires you to...

18
00:00:51,548 --> 00:00:53,815
I guess I should have
read it more carefully.

19
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:55,551
I'm not a legal expert,
Commander.

20
00:00:55,592 --> 00:00:58,656
I'm not a legal expert either,
but I can assure you

21
00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:00,168
after I talk to Quark

22
00:01:00,202 --> 00:01:03,073
he won't hold you or anyone else
to this provision concerning...

23
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:05,342
Commander, sensors
are picking up

24
00:01:05,381 --> 00:01:07,010
elevated neutrino readings.

25
00:01:07,052 --> 00:01:09,421
Something's coming
through the wormhole.

26
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:10,927
Excuse me.

27
00:01:10,961 --> 00:01:12,555
Thank you, Commander.

28
00:01:12,598 --> 00:01:14,899
Are any of the transports
due back?

29
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:16,738
Not according to our logs.

30
00:01:16,775 --> 00:01:18,609
Put us on Yellow Alert.

31
00:01:27,669 --> 00:01:29,298
It doesn't match anything
in Starfleet files.

32
00:01:29,372 --> 00:01:31,137
I'm getting readings
of a massive energy flux.

33
00:01:31,176 --> 00:01:34,149
It could be damaged.

34
00:01:34,184 --> 00:01:37,316
Sensors indicate a single
humanoid life-form on board.

35
00:01:37,391 --> 00:01:38,724
Hail it.

36
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:40,561
Aye, sir.

37
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,630
Hail acknowledged.
Response coming in.

38
00:01:43,673 --> 00:01:45,336
On screen.

39
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,711
Welcome to the Alpha Quadrant.

40
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,447
I'm Commander Benjamin Sisko

41
00:01:49,487 --> 00:01:51,458
of the United Federation
of Planets.

42
00:01:51,492 --> 00:01:53,326
Alpha Quadrant?

43
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:56,359
You've passed through a wormhole
into a new part of the galaxy.

44
00:01:56,437 --> 00:01:58,305
I saw a small ship disappear.

45
00:01:58,341 --> 00:01:59,469
I followed it.

46
00:01:59,511 --> 00:02:01,414
That was one
of our patrol vessels.

47
00:02:01,449 --> 00:02:03,852
You've traveled
almost 90,000 light years.

48
00:02:03,888 --> 00:02:05,551
What planet do you come from?

49
00:02:05,593 --> 00:02:07,564
How long does it last,
this anomaly?

50
00:02:07,597 --> 00:02:08,725
It's stable.

51
00:02:08,767 --> 00:02:11,068
You can return
whenever you want to.

52
00:02:11,105 --> 00:02:13,076
In the meantime,
you're welcome to dock here

53
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,513
and we'll try
to answer all your questions.

54
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,019
No. No time.

55
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:20,358
Inertial stress is overloading
his structural capacity.

56
00:02:20,394 --> 00:02:22,365
Prepare to transport him
off his ship.

57
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:24,461
I will not abandon my vessel.

58
00:02:24,504 --> 00:02:25,996
Sir, your ship
is in danger of...

59
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,567
I will not leave!

60
00:02:27,612 --> 00:02:29,480
We can use a tractor beam
to tow him in.

61
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:30,985
The beam's graviton field

62
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,253
should shore up
the structural integrity.

63
00:02:33,292 --> 00:02:34,260
Do it.

64
00:02:34,295 --> 00:02:35,263
Cut your engines.

65
00:02:35,297 --> 00:02:36,527
Why?

66
00:02:36,567 --> 00:02:38,765
So I can save your ship, friend.

67
00:02:38,805 --> 00:02:40,035
We'll bring you in

68
00:02:40,075 --> 00:02:42,012
try to fix you up
as good as new.

69
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,059
Good.

70
00:02:48,094 --> 00:02:49,529
Engaging tractor beam.

71
00:02:49,564 --> 00:02:51,432
Steady, now.

72
00:02:51,469 --> 00:02:53,770
You feel the graviton field

73
00:02:53,808 --> 00:02:55,972
taking hold?

74
00:02:56,013 --> 00:02:57,312
Yes.

75
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,344
You'll be fine now.

76
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:02,954
Just relax and enjoy the ride.

77
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:06,332
I think we might want to skip

78
00:03:06,372 --> 00:03:08,069
formal first-contact
procedures for now.

79
00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:09,772
Agreed.

80
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:13,318
Why don't you meet him
by yourself

81
00:03:13,354 --> 00:03:15,325
at the airlock, Mr. O'Brien?

82
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:18,423
He might find that
a little less intimidating.

83
00:03:18,534 --> 00:03:19,593
Aye, sir.

84
00:03:19,636 --> 00:03:22,609
And, if you can...

85
00:03:22,643 --> 00:03:26,106
find out
what he's so nervous about.

86
00:03:26,152 --> 00:03:27,644
Aye, sir.

87
00:05:57,928 --> 00:05:59,397
O'Brien to Ops.

88
00:05:59,433 --> 00:06:01,495
Go ahead, Chief.

89
00:06:01,537 --> 00:06:03,063
Sure you didn't

90
00:06:03,108 --> 00:06:05,011
beam this fellow out
when I wasn't looking?

91
00:06:05,046 --> 00:06:06,345
Negative.

92
00:06:06,382 --> 00:06:08,376
He's not in here.

93
00:06:10,392 --> 00:06:13,833
Sensors say
he's still on board, Chief.

94
00:06:15,805 --> 00:06:19,246
Friend... if you're in here

95
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,882
you've got nothing
to worry about from me.

96
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,919
Understand?

97
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:38,987
I'm just going to take
a look at your ship

98
00:06:39,027 --> 00:06:41,829
see what the problem is, okay?

99
00:06:47,982 --> 00:06:51,114
And just to let you know,
I'm an engineer.

100
00:06:51,157 --> 00:06:56,329
I know a little bit about ships.

101
00:06:56,369 --> 00:07:00,105
Well, more than a little,
actually.

102
00:07:00,144 --> 00:07:02,115
Though I'll tell you

103
00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:05,419
I've never seen anything
close to this.

104
00:07:06,928 --> 00:07:09,161
All right, then.

105
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,663
Is this some sort
of plasma injector?

106
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:16,149
Okay, then...

107
00:07:16,183 --> 00:07:21,423
then that must be an off-axis
field controller over there.

108
00:07:21,462 --> 00:07:22,863
Uh-huh.

109
00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:24,459
Uh-huh.

110
00:07:24,536 --> 00:07:28,238
The coladrium flow
has been damaged.

111
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:31,480
You can't go sneaking up
on someone like that, friend.

112
00:07:31,586 --> 00:07:33,420
It's an Alpha Quadrant rule.

113
00:07:36,733 --> 00:07:39,204
Can it be repaired?

114
00:07:39,238 --> 00:07:41,300
Well, that all depends.

115
00:07:41,343 --> 00:07:42,903
Depends?

116
00:07:42,947 --> 00:07:47,390
On what exactly
a coladrium flow is.

117
00:07:47,424 --> 00:07:48,893
On my world, it would be simple.

118
00:07:48,929 --> 00:07:51,366
With proper materials,
I could do it myself.

119
00:07:51,401 --> 00:07:52,529
Hang on.

120
00:07:52,604 --> 00:07:54,768
I didn't say we
couldn't figure it out.

121
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:57,441
You're just going to have
to teach me as we go.

122
00:07:57,482 --> 00:07:58,951
I'm sure that we can...

123
00:07:58,986 --> 00:08:00,615
I have no time.

124
00:08:00,656 --> 00:08:01,886
I know.

125
00:08:01,926 --> 00:08:04,022
Everyone's
in a hurry these days.

126
00:08:04,065 --> 00:08:05,159
We'll have you on your way

127
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,931
as soon as it's
humanly possible.

128
00:08:06,972 --> 00:08:10,002
That's me, by the way...
human species.

129
00:08:10,045 --> 00:08:12,039
Name's O'Brien.

130
00:08:12,084 --> 00:08:14,248
Oh Brien.

131
00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:16,760
Miles O'Brien,
Chief of Operations.

132
00:08:16,795 --> 00:08:18,264
How about you?

133
00:08:18,299 --> 00:08:21,295
I am Tosk.

134
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:24,905
That's your name
or your species?

135
00:08:26,518 --> 00:08:28,648
I am Tosk.

136
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:29,852
Oh.

137
00:08:29,893 --> 00:08:32,364
Tosk it is.

138
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,393
Come on.

139
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,112
There's nothing to be
afraid of out there.

140
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:43,888
We've got to wait for your
reactor to cool down anyway

141
00:08:43,926 --> 00:08:45,555
before we can
do anything else.

142
00:08:46,599 --> 00:08:47,898
Come on.

143
00:08:52,313 --> 00:08:55,411
I've got work to do.

144
00:09:12,896 --> 00:09:14,924
So, what happened
to you, anyway?

145
00:09:14,968 --> 00:09:15,936
Looks like you took

146
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,439
some sort of a shock
to your hull.

147
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:20,605
The passage through
the anomaly was very rough.

148
00:09:20,648 --> 00:09:22,744
Yeah, sure.

149
00:09:22,786 --> 00:09:25,053
The wormhole can
shake you up, all right.

150
00:09:35,517 --> 00:09:37,248
Security sensor.

151
00:09:37,288 --> 00:09:38,814
Screens for weapons.

152
00:09:38,858 --> 00:09:40,886
It's just picking up my phaser.

153
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,026
You're fine.

154
00:09:48,615 --> 00:09:50,449
You wear a weapon.

155
00:09:50,486 --> 00:09:52,457
Defensive purposes only.

156
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,552
It may not seem hospitable

157
00:09:54,596 --> 00:09:56,931
but when you go into an alien
ship for the first time

158
00:09:56,969 --> 00:09:59,601
you never know
what might be in there.

159
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:01,441
You may even find someone

160
00:10:01,479 --> 00:10:03,279
who can make
himself invisible.

161
00:10:03,316 --> 00:10:05,412
You know what I mean?

162
00:10:13,608 --> 00:10:15,841
I understand.

163
00:10:22,329 --> 00:10:24,858
A health center?

164
00:10:24,902 --> 00:10:27,466
Yeah. That's Dr. Bashir.

165
00:10:27,508 --> 00:10:30,413
He looks after
our medical problems.

166
00:10:32,788 --> 00:10:35,420
How many live here?

167
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,954
Well, 300, more or less.

168
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,403
What is its purpose?

169
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:42,342
Purpose?

170
00:10:42,377 --> 00:10:44,074
Defense?

171
00:10:44,114 --> 00:10:45,583
Surveillance?

172
00:10:45,618 --> 00:10:48,614
Well, sometimes,
when I walk along here

173
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:50,630
I feel like we're
the flea market

174
00:10:50,664 --> 00:10:51,654
to the sector.

175
00:10:52,668 --> 00:10:55,037
But I guess our real job

176
00:10:55,074 --> 00:10:57,545
is to keep an eye
on the wormhole.

177
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:01,316
There's traffic going in
and out all the time now.

178
00:11:01,356 --> 00:11:03,121
Many ships dock here.

179
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,789
Five or six a week.

180
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,462
We sometimes
have a whole convoy

181
00:11:07,504 --> 00:11:09,941
on its way
through the wormhole.

182
00:11:09,977 --> 00:11:11,948
But you have the honor

183
00:11:11,981 --> 00:11:14,954
of being the first visitor
from the other side.

184
00:11:14,989 --> 00:11:18,452
Others will detect ships
from your quadrant, as I did

185
00:11:18,497 --> 00:11:20,126
and follow them here.

186
00:11:20,168 --> 00:11:21,637
We hope so.

187
00:11:21,671 --> 00:11:23,642
Our mission as
Starfleet officers

188
00:11:23,676 --> 00:11:25,806
is to seek out new life-forms

189
00:11:25,848 --> 00:11:27,978
so we can learn
about each other.

190
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,788
Madam, I distinctly saw you

191
00:11:30,827 --> 00:11:32,957
move your wager
to the green line

192
00:11:32,998 --> 00:11:35,333
after the play was completed.

193
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,500
I will return your currency

194
00:11:37,542 --> 00:11:41,005
but you will promptly
leave the establishment.

195
00:11:41,051 --> 00:11:43,545
You are not welcome here.

196
00:11:46,364 --> 00:11:51,331
Well, there are some things
to learn about us that can wait.

197
00:11:54,216 --> 00:11:55,776
How about you?

198
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,386
You an explorer?
A scientist?

199
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:01,365
I am Tosk.

200
00:12:02,602 --> 00:12:04,367
Right.

201
00:12:06,211 --> 00:12:08,205
Computer, lights.

202
00:12:11,824 --> 00:12:15,458
Oh, I wasn't the decorator.

203
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,598
I wish to begin work
on my ship.

204
00:12:18,641 --> 00:12:21,671
Yes, well, we'll start
as soon as we can.

205
00:12:21,715 --> 00:12:24,711
Now, why don't
you get some rest?

206
00:12:24,755 --> 00:12:27,887
I require only 17 minutes
of sleep per rotation.

207
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,559
17? No kidding?

208
00:12:29,601 --> 00:12:32,574
If I don't get a good
eight hours a night

209
00:12:32,608 --> 00:12:34,408
I'm not the same man.

210
00:12:34,446 --> 00:12:35,915
Are you hungry?

211
00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:37,248
Hungry?

212
00:12:37,286 --> 00:12:39,757
You know, would you like to eat?

213
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,351
Take in sustenance.

214
00:12:41,395 --> 00:12:43,126
Liquid nutrients are stored

215
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,433
in plasmic fibers
throughout my body.

216
00:12:45,472 --> 00:12:46,941
Oh.

217
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,607
Well, this is the food
replicator over here

218
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:51,620
in case you change your mind.

219
00:12:51,654 --> 00:12:54,753
We finally got it making
a pretty good bowl of oatmeal.

220
00:12:54,886 --> 00:12:58,452
Just ask the computer
if you need anything else.

221
00:12:59,865 --> 00:13:02,359
Oh Brien...

222
00:13:02,405 --> 00:13:04,342
thank you.

223
00:13:04,376 --> 00:13:07,748
As the Vulcans say,
we're here to serve.

224
00:13:26,161 --> 00:13:27,892
Computer...

225
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:29,596
State request.

226
00:13:29,637 --> 00:13:33,271
I wish to see a display
of this facility.

227
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:37,117
Specify exterior
or interior display.

228
00:13:37,154 --> 00:13:39,318
Interior.

229
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:42,663
Interior display available
in 19 sections.

230
00:13:42,701 --> 00:13:45,138
Specify requirements.

231
00:13:45,174 --> 00:13:48,011
Show me where
the weapons are stored.

232
00:13:48,048 --> 00:13:52,754
Habitat ring, level five,
section three.

233
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:57,132
Access restricted to security
clearance 7 and above.

234
00:14:06,592 --> 00:14:08,323
It's hard to say, sir.

235
00:14:08,396 --> 00:14:10,526
You hate to prejudge anyone.

236
00:14:10,568 --> 00:14:12,664
What are you thinking, Chief?

237
00:14:12,706 --> 00:14:13,834
You know the old saying...

238
00:14:13,876 --> 00:14:16,040
"A man who's always
looking over his shoulder

239
00:14:16,081 --> 00:14:17,812
is waiting for trouble
to find him."

240
00:14:17,852 --> 00:14:18,911
You think he's on the run?

241
00:14:18,955 --> 00:14:20,515
I'll tell you this...
he wasn't telling

242
00:14:20,558 --> 00:14:23,497
the whole truth
about the damage to his ship.

243
00:14:23,532 --> 00:14:26,061
It sure wasn't caused
by the wormhole.

244
00:14:26,105 --> 00:14:27,973
Somebody took a shot at him.

245
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,847
It came in at a 45 degree angle
to the hull

246
00:14:30,884 --> 00:14:33,082
sliced through
two propulsion systems.

247
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,528
I'll know more when I get
a better look at it.

248
00:14:36,563 --> 00:14:40,197
Stay with him as much
as possible while he's here.

249
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:43,007
I'll tell Odo
to keep an eye on him, too.

250
00:14:43,046 --> 00:14:44,036
Aye, sir.

251
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,427
No. The coladrium flows
through the arva nodes.

252
00:14:52,469 --> 00:14:53,938
What are they?

253
00:14:53,972 --> 00:14:56,341
Some kind of high energy
magnetic coils?

254
00:14:56,377 --> 00:14:58,074
For fuel replenishment.

255
00:14:58,116 --> 00:15:00,053
Fuel?
Oh, like a ramscoop.

256
00:15:00,086 --> 00:15:01,385
Ramscoop?

257
00:15:01,423 --> 00:15:03,519
Yeah, to capture stellar gasses

258
00:15:03,561 --> 00:15:05,896
and convert them
into usable fuel.

259
00:15:05,934 --> 00:15:09,397
Yes. The arva nodes convert
space matter into fuel.

260
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,879
Ah, gotcha.

261
00:15:11,915 --> 00:15:13,909
Mm, piece of cake.

262
00:15:13,953 --> 00:15:16,687
Piece of cake.
Ramscoop. Arva nodes.

263
00:15:16,727 --> 00:15:19,928
"Piece of cake"...it's
an old human expression.

264
00:15:19,967 --> 00:15:22,336
It means they'll be
easy to fix.

265
00:15:22,374 --> 00:15:24,345
They will be easy to fix?

266
00:15:24,378 --> 00:15:25,642
Sure. Yeah.

267
00:15:25,681 --> 00:15:28,279
We'll just get my crew
to remove your arva nodes

268
00:15:28,321 --> 00:15:31,089
then we'll take them over
to the replicator center

269
00:15:31,128 --> 00:15:32,153
and make new ones.

270
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:34,992
Piece of cake.

271
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:40,204
How long?

272
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,312
Oh...

273
00:15:42,354 --> 00:15:44,484
maybe a day or two.

274
00:15:44,594 --> 00:15:49,037
We'll want to run some tests
after the replacement unit's in.

275
00:15:49,071 --> 00:15:50,871
No. No time for that.

276
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,642
Hey, I let you
take that unit out

277
00:15:53,681 --> 00:15:55,173
without proper testing

278
00:15:55,218 --> 00:15:57,018
it breaks down, you blame me

279
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,525
next thing I know

280
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,365
my work has a bad reputation
in the Gamma Quadrant.

281
00:16:02,402 --> 00:16:05,136
I would not blame you.

282
00:16:05,175 --> 00:16:07,646
I was joking, Tosk.

283
00:16:07,682 --> 00:16:10,712
I cannot tell... Oh Brien.

284
00:16:10,756 --> 00:16:12,750
Sorry, it's in my nature.

285
00:16:12,794 --> 00:16:15,961
And you're the most
natural straight man

286
00:16:16,001 --> 00:16:17,595
I've met in ages.

287
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:20,339
Come on, while the fellas
are working here

288
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,943
I'll buy you a drink
and you can tell me

289
00:16:22,985 --> 00:16:24,648
why you're in such a rush.

290
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:28,863
Dabo!

291
00:16:42,566 --> 00:16:46,234
Nothing like this
exists on my world.

292
00:16:46,274 --> 00:16:49,715
This is where we do
most of our R&R.

293
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,314
What is "R&R"?

294
00:16:52,355 --> 00:16:54,155
Rest and relaxation.

295
00:16:54,193 --> 00:16:56,187
You know, down time.

296
00:16:56,232 --> 00:16:58,430
When we're not working.

297
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:02,435
You sleep a full third
of your rotation.

298
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:07,287
You rest and relax
while you are awake.

299
00:17:07,324 --> 00:17:11,323
Alpha Quadrant has
far too much down time.

300
00:17:12,938 --> 00:17:14,875
My wife would laugh at that.

301
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,077
She's barely seen me
in the last three weeks.

302
00:17:18,117 --> 00:17:22,253
We are very different

303
00:17:22,294 --> 00:17:25,267
Tosk and Oh Brien.

304
00:17:25,301 --> 00:17:26,895
I've noticed.

305
00:17:28,509 --> 00:17:29,876
Hey, barkeep!

306
00:17:29,912 --> 00:17:31,347
Don't call me "barkeep."

307
00:17:31,382 --> 00:17:32,612
I'm not a barkeep.

308
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:35,122
I'm your host.

309
00:17:35,158 --> 00:17:36,525
The proprietor.

310
00:17:36,561 --> 00:17:38,030
A sympathetic ear
to the wretched souls

311
00:17:38,065 --> 00:17:39,261
that pass through
these portals.

312
00:17:39,301 --> 00:17:44,143
And a man who will exploit
any vice you may have.

313
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,982
Two synthales, barkeep.

314
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,250
I am sorry.

315
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:51,422
I have no vices
for you to exploit.

316
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,260
A challenge.

317
00:17:54,304 --> 00:17:58,542
Tosk is our first guest
from the Gamma Quadrant, Quark.

318
00:17:58,581 --> 00:18:00,415
I'd take him at his word.

319
00:18:00,452 --> 00:18:04,554
Perhaps a short adventure
in a holosuite?

320
00:18:04,595 --> 00:18:06,589
Holosuite?

321
00:18:06,633 --> 00:18:11,805
A fantasy encounter with
danger, romance, thrills

322
00:18:11,845 --> 00:18:14,579
created for
your personal entertainment

323
00:18:14,619 --> 00:18:16,282
by the brothers Quark.

324
00:18:16,324 --> 00:18:20,528
I have no use
for fantasy adventure.

325
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:24,669
I live the greatest adventure
one could ever desire.

326
00:18:27,283 --> 00:18:30,553
Then I envy you, Mr. Tosk.

327
00:18:40,214 --> 00:18:42,880
What are you talking
about, Tosk?

328
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:47,192
What is this adventure
you're on?

329
00:18:47,231 --> 00:18:50,136
I cannot discuss it.

330
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,369
Oh, sure.

331
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,743
Of course.

332
00:19:01,164 --> 00:19:03,635
Sounds like you've changed
your mind about him, Chief.

333
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:04,900
Not exactly.

334
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,970
I mean he's running from
something, that's for sure.

335
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:09,381
And he's in danger.

336
00:19:09,417 --> 00:19:12,117
And he can't, or won't
talk about it.

337
00:19:12,157 --> 00:19:14,721
People tell doctors things
they wouldn't tell anyone else.

338
00:19:14,796 --> 00:19:16,060
If you could get him to have

339
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,003
a routine medical
examination, maybe I...

340
00:19:18,038 --> 00:19:21,034
The thing is, I kind
of like the guy.

341
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:23,049
I'm not even sure why.

342
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,554
In a way, he's almost naive.

343
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:29,657
I guess anyone would be
in an alien environment

344
00:19:29,699 --> 00:19:31,932
but I don't sense a threat
of criminal intent

345
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:33,565
or dishonesty about him.

346
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:34,771
I thought you said
he lied about

347
00:19:34,879 --> 00:19:36,576
the damage to his ship.

348
00:19:36,616 --> 00:19:38,746
He didn't exactly lie.

349
00:19:38,788 --> 00:19:42,730
But he didn't exactly
tell the truth either.

350
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,928
He keeps the truth
pretty much to himself.

351
00:19:44,969 --> 00:19:47,099
When do you think
his ship will be ready?

352
00:19:47,141 --> 00:19:48,109
Tomorrow.

353
00:19:48,143 --> 00:19:51,379
I don't see that we have
much of a choice.

354
00:19:51,418 --> 00:19:52,717
We can't hold him.

355
00:19:52,755 --> 00:19:55,751
If he wants to tell
you the truth, fine.

356
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:57,959
If not...

357
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,794
wish him well
and send him on his way.

358
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:32,463
Just what do you
think you're doing?

359
00:20:36,411 --> 00:20:40,147
Computer, seal off
corridor 14-A, Habitat Level 5.

360
00:20:40,186 --> 00:20:41,485
Seal confirmed.

361
00:20:41,523 --> 00:20:44,394
Security to Habitat 514-A.

362
00:20:57,327 --> 00:20:58,887
When you get tired
of bouncing

363
00:20:58,931 --> 00:21:00,902
off force fields,
we can talk, all right?

364
00:21:02,773 --> 00:21:04,333
I did nothing to you.

365
00:21:04,378 --> 00:21:07,112
It's that security junction
I'm curious about.

366
00:21:07,151 --> 00:21:09,680
I must prepare.

367
00:21:09,723 --> 00:21:11,317
For what?

368
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,331
I cannot discuss it.

369
00:21:13,365 --> 00:21:14,595
I am Tosk.

370
00:21:14,668 --> 00:21:17,698
I'm sure you are.

371
00:21:17,742 --> 00:21:19,439
Why don't we go down
to my office

372
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,883
while your friend,
Chief O'Brien takes a look

373
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,322
to see just what you've
been doing in there?

374
00:21:25,394 --> 00:21:26,624
Oh Brien?

375
00:21:26,664 --> 00:21:27,826
Right.

376
00:21:27,866 --> 00:21:31,363
I'm going to release
the force fields now.

377
00:21:31,408 --> 00:21:35,008
I don't need a fight
from you, understand?

378
00:21:35,051 --> 00:21:36,851
I will not fight you.

379
00:21:36,888 --> 00:21:38,984
Good.

380
00:21:39,027 --> 00:21:42,866
Computer, release
the security seals.

381
00:22:10,669 --> 00:22:12,572
I cannot discuss it.

382
00:22:12,607 --> 00:22:14,441
And I can't accept
that as an answer.

383
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:16,176
I did nothing to you.

384
00:22:16,216 --> 00:22:18,449
You were tampering
with the security grid.

385
00:22:18,488 --> 00:22:19,684
I consider that a threat.

386
00:22:19,724 --> 00:22:22,356
I think he was trying
to shut out the lock-outs

387
00:22:22,398 --> 00:22:23,366
to section three.

388
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,528
The weapons locker.

389
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,803
What were you going
to do with the weapons?

390
00:22:26,841 --> 00:22:28,835
Are you wanted by authorities

391
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,509
somewhere
in the Gamma Quadrant?

392
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,817
"Wanted?"

393
00:22:32,855 --> 00:22:34,689
Have you committed crimes?

394
00:22:36,431 --> 00:22:38,732
Never. I am Tosk.

395
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,707
What does that mean?

396
00:22:40,741 --> 00:22:42,905
Is that supposed
to explain all this?

397
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:45,110
It is all I can say.

398
00:22:45,152 --> 00:22:48,250
Tosk, don't you think
we deserve some answers?

399
00:22:48,293 --> 00:22:50,594
What should I do with him?

400
00:22:50,632 --> 00:22:52,363
Hold him for now.

401
00:22:52,403 --> 00:22:53,531
We'll wait to see

402
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:55,303
if someone shows up
looking for him.

403
00:23:07,773 --> 00:23:10,405
Enough of this craziness, Tosk.

404
00:23:10,446 --> 00:23:12,975
Tell me, what were you doing?

405
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:17,724
Oh Brien...
you must let me out.

406
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:19,734
Tell me.

407
00:23:19,768 --> 00:23:22,673
Allow me to die with honor.

408
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:24,440
Die?

409
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,784
Who would want to kill you,
Tosk?

410
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:36,869
Allow me to die with honor.

411
00:23:41,855 --> 00:23:44,987
He's climbing the walls
like a trapped animal.

412
00:23:45,028 --> 00:23:49,164
I'm sorry our jail cells
aren't to his liking.

413
00:23:49,205 --> 00:23:51,608
Somehow, I feel responsible.

414
00:23:51,645 --> 00:23:53,376
You do?

415
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:57,984
Yeah, well, I guess
I kind of adopted him.

416
00:23:58,026 --> 00:24:00,429
I talked him into coming
on board.

417
00:24:00,466 --> 00:24:01,628
You didn't talk him

418
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:04,072
into breaking
into the security system.

419
00:24:04,108 --> 00:24:06,306
I just feel sorry for him.

420
00:24:06,346 --> 00:24:09,946
Somehow, I don't think
he means us any harm.

421
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:15,865
What the hell is his secret?

422
00:24:23,889 --> 00:24:27,523
Sensors are picking up
ionized L-band emissions.

423
00:24:27,564 --> 00:24:29,694
The patterns match Tosk's ship.

424
00:24:29,736 --> 00:24:32,972
Hail them. Maybe we'll
finally get a few answers.

425
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,981
No response.

426
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,248
Again, rotate frequencies.

427
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,886
It's a modulated particle beam.

428
00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:42,159
It's scanning us.

429
00:24:42,199 --> 00:24:43,167
Ready shields.

430
00:24:43,202 --> 00:24:44,227
Not yet, Major.

431
00:24:44,271 --> 00:24:45,399
Let them have a good look at us.

432
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,741
I'm reading phased
power fluctuations.

433
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:49,750
They may be readying
a transporter of some kind.

434
00:24:49,784 --> 00:24:50,752
Now, Major.

435
00:24:50,786 --> 00:24:51,754
Shields up.

436
00:24:51,789 --> 00:24:52,917
Open all hailing channels.

437
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,052
Open.

438
00:24:54,094 --> 00:24:57,226
This is Commander Benjamin Sisko
of the United...

439
00:24:57,268 --> 00:24:58,362
They're bombarding us

440
00:24:58,405 --> 00:25:00,376
with some kind of radiation
I've never seen before.

441
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,939
Very rapid magnetic
flux variations.

442
00:25:07,994 --> 00:25:09,019
What the?

443
00:25:09,064 --> 00:25:11,331
They've reversed
the polarity of our shields.

444
00:25:11,369 --> 00:25:13,465
I'm picking up
transporter locks.

445
00:25:13,507 --> 00:25:14,840
They're beaming on board.

446
00:25:14,877 --> 00:25:15,845
Location?

447
00:25:15,879 --> 00:25:17,816
Promenade.

448
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:19,582
Security to the Promenade.

449
00:25:19,622 --> 00:25:21,251
Kira and O'Brien with me.

450
00:25:21,293 --> 00:25:22,990
Dax, you have Ops.

451
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:42,334
Ready phasers.

452
00:25:53,102 --> 00:25:55,232
I'm Commander of this station.

453
00:25:55,274 --> 00:25:57,108
Put down your weapons.

454
00:26:21,035 --> 00:26:23,506
Increase setting to level six.

455
00:26:24,477 --> 00:26:26,242
It's that Tosk they're after.

456
00:26:26,282 --> 00:26:28,116
Maybe they have a right to him.

457
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:30,454
Nobody's abducting
a prisoner out of my brig

458
00:26:30,492 --> 00:26:31,961
as long as I'm alive.

459
00:26:34,101 --> 00:26:35,034
You may need this.

460
00:26:35,103 --> 00:26:36,036
Thanks, Major.

461
00:26:36,105 --> 00:26:37,130
You know I never use them.

462
00:27:56,552 --> 00:27:58,044
I have Tosk...

463
00:27:58,089 --> 00:28:00,060
...alive.

464
00:28:00,094 --> 00:28:02,588
It is over.

465
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:14,125
What a disappointment.

466
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:18,463
And after such
an entertaining beginning.

467
00:28:18,505 --> 00:28:19,473
Entertaining?!

468
00:28:19,541 --> 00:28:22,275
These aliens gave us
a great deal of resistance.

469
00:28:22,314 --> 00:28:24,683
We wondered how you got
their cooperation

470
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:27,248
without violating
your oath of silence.

471
00:28:27,293 --> 00:28:28,626
I told them nothing.

472
00:28:30,968 --> 00:28:33,439
But to see you here...

473
00:28:33,474 --> 00:28:35,308
caged...

474
00:28:35,345 --> 00:28:37,475
helpless...

475
00:28:37,517 --> 00:28:39,818
how could you allow this?

476
00:28:39,855 --> 00:28:42,190
It is a disgrace to all Tosk

477
00:28:42,229 --> 00:28:45,202
and the most disappointing
hunt in memory.

478
00:28:45,236 --> 00:28:48,141
You're saying that this
whole thing is a hunt

479
00:28:48,176 --> 00:28:50,170
and Tosk is the prey?

480
00:28:53,789 --> 00:28:55,258
You are right.

481
00:28:55,293 --> 00:28:59,633
This Tosk is unworthy
of such a noble description.

482
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:05,183
For this dishonor,
you will endure

483
00:29:05,217 --> 00:29:07,211
the greatest humiliation

484
00:29:07,255 --> 00:29:08,986
Tosk can know...

485
00:29:09,026 --> 00:29:13,401
to be captured
and brought home alive.

486
00:29:13,436 --> 00:29:17,138
You will live out your existence
on public display

487
00:29:17,179 --> 00:29:18,739
where children
can make fun of you

488
00:29:18,783 --> 00:29:21,551
toss you scraps of food

489
00:29:21,589 --> 00:29:23,890
which is more than you deserve.

490
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,669
Release him.

491
00:29:27,704 --> 00:29:30,404
You've disrupted
life on this station

492
00:29:30,444 --> 00:29:32,915
for the pleasure
of your "hunt"?

493
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:35,548
I'm not inclined to take orders
from you.

494
00:29:35,589 --> 00:29:37,058
Odo, watch the prisoner

495
00:29:37,093 --> 00:29:40,534
while our guest and I
discuss this in private

496
00:29:40,568 --> 00:29:42,869
unless you intend
to take him by force.

497
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:44,810
In which case, I'm
prepared to give orders

498
00:29:44,845 --> 00:29:46,405
to open fire on your ship.

499
00:29:46,449 --> 00:29:47,782
Over this Tosk?!

500
00:30:25,007 --> 00:30:27,809
Have you nothing similar
in your own society?

501
00:30:27,848 --> 00:30:30,548
Centuries ago, people on my
world engaged in blood sports...

502
00:30:30,588 --> 00:30:32,491
killing lower species
for pleasure.

503
00:30:32,526 --> 00:30:33,927
A few cultures still do

504
00:30:33,963 --> 00:30:36,936
but even they wouldn't consider
hunting a sentient being.

505
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:41,106
But he is sentient only because
we have made him sentient.

506
00:30:41,146 --> 00:30:44,119
He has been bred for the hunt.

507
00:30:44,153 --> 00:30:47,285
His entire reason
to exist is the hunt...

508
00:30:47,328 --> 00:30:52,068
to make it as exciting,
as interesting as he can.

509
00:30:52,106 --> 00:30:54,236
Obviously, you
do not comprehend.

510
00:30:54,278 --> 00:30:55,907
I comprehend just fine.

511
00:30:55,949 --> 00:30:59,515
I have no tolerance
for the abuse of any life-form.

512
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:01,221
Abuse?

513
00:31:04,001 --> 00:31:05,972
We honor Tosk.

514
00:31:06,006 --> 00:31:08,500
They are the symbol of all

515
00:31:08,545 --> 00:31:11,347
that is noble and courageous.

516
00:31:11,385 --> 00:31:13,879
They train and condition
themselves

517
00:31:13,925 --> 00:31:18,892
all their lives for this event.

518
00:31:18,937 --> 00:31:24,075
They're proud of their role
in our culture.

519
00:31:24,116 --> 00:31:28,752
I can't judge what is right
and wrong for your world

520
00:31:28,794 --> 00:31:31,265
but on this station...

521
00:31:34,374 --> 00:31:37,347
In the future,
passage through the anomaly

522
00:31:37,382 --> 00:31:40,355
will be considered
out of bounds for the hunt.

523
00:31:40,389 --> 00:31:42,052
Will that satisfy you?

524
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:51,173
Now, you will arrange
for release of the Tosk.

525
00:31:59,267 --> 00:32:01,067
I've agreed to release him.

526
00:32:01,105 --> 00:32:05,639
But, sir, Tosk is
an intelligent, living being.

527
00:32:05,682 --> 00:32:06,810
It's their custom, Chief.

528
00:32:06,852 --> 00:32:08,287
Under the Prime Directive

529
00:32:08,322 --> 00:32:09,985
we have no right to interfere.

530
00:32:10,026 --> 00:32:13,523
What if Tosk were
to request asylum?

531
00:32:21,253 --> 00:32:23,417
If he asks for it.

532
00:32:32,346 --> 00:32:35,809
All right,
I have a way out for you.

533
00:32:35,854 --> 00:32:38,827
A way out...

534
00:32:38,862 --> 00:32:40,354
of here?

535
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,529
Request asylum.

536
00:32:42,571 --> 00:32:44,565
Asylum.

537
00:32:44,609 --> 00:32:47,741
You ask for the protection
of the Federation.

538
00:32:47,783 --> 00:32:49,013
You understand?

539
00:32:49,053 --> 00:32:51,685
My Commander is willing
to protect you.

540
00:32:56,003 --> 00:33:00,970
Oh Brien, I am Tosk.

541
00:33:01,015 --> 00:33:03,647
I cannot hide here

542
00:33:03,688 --> 00:33:06,992
behind the protection
of your Federation.

543
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:10,161
It is against
everything I believe.

544
00:33:10,203 --> 00:33:11,502
You'd rather go back

545
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,841
and live in a cage
on public display?

546
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:18,016
To stay would be
a greater dishonor.

547
00:33:18,055 --> 00:33:20,653
I am Tosk

548
00:33:20,695 --> 00:33:23,064
the hunted.

549
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:29,242
I live to outwit the hunters
for another day

550
00:33:29,283 --> 00:33:33,658
to survive
until I die with honor.

551
00:33:44,085 --> 00:33:47,081
But that will not be my fate.

552
00:33:52,237 --> 00:33:56,407
But I will not deny
my existence as Tosk.

553
00:33:58,085 --> 00:34:01,582
Thank you, Oh Brien...

554
00:34:08,945 --> 00:34:12,944
but I cannot request asylum.

555
00:34:31,995 --> 00:34:34,262
So far, I'm not impressed
with the tourist trade

556
00:34:34,301 --> 00:34:35,463
from the Gamma Quadrant.

557
00:34:35,504 --> 00:34:37,498
Not one of them has
bought a single drink.

558
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:38,669
Shut up, Quark.

559
00:34:40,048 --> 00:34:42,178
More trouble
with the little woman.

560
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,450
What's that supposed to mean?

561
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:44,458
Nothing, nothing.

562
00:34:44,492 --> 00:34:46,326
I just thought you
might want to talk.

563
00:34:46,363 --> 00:34:48,561
There is nothing wrong
between my wife and I.

564
00:34:48,602 --> 00:34:50,573
And if there were,
I sure as hell

565
00:34:50,607 --> 00:34:53,478
wouldn't want to talk
to some barkeep about it.

566
00:34:53,514 --> 00:34:55,678
Sorry. My mistake.

567
00:34:59,227 --> 00:35:00,594
What?!

568
00:35:02,268 --> 00:35:04,603
Your face gets very...

569
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,342
pink when it gets aggravated.

570
00:35:08,383 --> 00:35:10,251
Much more so
than most other humans.

571
00:35:10,287 --> 00:35:11,517
So stop aggravating me.

572
00:35:11,557 --> 00:35:12,525
Oh, not me.

573
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:14,621
You came in the door this way.

574
00:35:14,664 --> 00:35:16,099
Fine. You're right,
I'm aggravated.

575
00:35:16,134 --> 00:35:18,503
I am a keen observer
of behavior.

576
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,508
You want to talk about it?

577
00:35:19,542 --> 00:35:20,510
No.

578
00:35:20,545 --> 00:35:21,809
Why not?

579
00:35:21,848 --> 00:35:24,412
Because it wouldn't do
any good talking to you.

580
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,653
Try me.

581
00:35:28,698 --> 00:35:30,099
Forget it.

582
00:35:30,134 --> 00:35:33,164
It's just the rules of the game.

583
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:34,507
Uh-huh.

584
00:35:34,545 --> 00:35:38,350
Rules of the game.
Go on.

585
00:35:38,388 --> 00:35:39,356
It's a hunt.

586
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,757
Did you know that?

587
00:35:40,793 --> 00:35:43,357
They're chasing Tosk in a hunt

588
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,234
and everybody's
playing by the rules.

589
00:35:45,271 --> 00:35:46,740
They're playing by their rules

590
00:35:46,774 --> 00:35:47,764
we're playing by ours

591
00:35:47,844 --> 00:35:49,336
and he's caught in the middle.

592
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:50,349
'Course, I suppose

593
00:35:50,383 --> 00:35:51,875
if the Ferengi don't
like the rules

594
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,888
they just change them.

595
00:35:52,923 --> 00:35:55,623
Well, rules, rules
are always subject to...

596
00:35:55,663 --> 00:35:57,257
Of course.

597
00:36:00,173 --> 00:36:01,973
Change the rules.

598
00:36:04,584 --> 00:36:06,555
Why didn't I think of that?

599
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,660
Thanks, barkeep.

600
00:36:16,879 --> 00:36:20,912
So... what's bothering you
today?

601
00:36:30,212 --> 00:36:32,410
Computer, access the power grid

602
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:35,788
to Security Checkpoint 4
on the Promenade.

603
00:36:39,367 --> 00:36:40,768
That isn't necessary.

604
00:36:40,804 --> 00:36:44,803
Our ritual requires it
when a Tosk is captured alive.

605
00:36:44,846 --> 00:36:46,440
All right, let's go.

606
00:36:46,484 --> 00:36:49,856
I'll escort the prisoner
to the transporter station.

607
00:36:49,893 --> 00:36:51,864
This is a security matter.

608
00:36:51,963 --> 00:36:53,866
This is a Starfleet matter.

609
00:36:53,968 --> 00:36:55,494
Orders from Sisko.

610
00:36:55,539 --> 00:36:57,635
We'll see about that.

611
00:36:57,677 --> 00:36:59,580
Do not trouble yourself.

612
00:36:59,615 --> 00:37:02,349
My ship will transport us.

613
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:04,189
No, sir,
that won't be necessary.

614
00:37:04,227 --> 00:37:06,289
Good relations
with other cultures

615
00:37:06,332 --> 00:37:07,824
is our highest priority.

616
00:37:07,869 --> 00:37:09,806
Commander Sisko
wants to make sure

617
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:14,010
you understand we're sorry
we interfered with your hunt.

618
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:16,146
The least we can do is give you

619
00:37:16,188 --> 00:37:18,854
an official escort
off the station.

620
00:37:18,928 --> 00:37:22,995
It's a token of goodwill
and respect in our society.

621
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:26,136
Very well.

622
00:37:32,327 --> 00:37:33,626
Starfleet has no business

623
00:37:33,664 --> 00:37:35,635
taking charge
of a prisoner transport.

624
00:37:35,669 --> 00:37:37,867
Calm down, Constable,
what are you talking about?

625
00:37:37,908 --> 00:37:39,879
I'm talking
about you ordering O'Brien

626
00:37:39,912 --> 00:37:41,506
to escort Tosk off the station.

627
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:44,021
I didn't give him
any orders at all.

628
00:37:44,055 --> 00:37:47,655
Sisko to O'Brien.

629
00:37:47,697 --> 00:37:50,397
Mr. O'Brien,
report to Ops immediately.

630
00:37:50,437 --> 00:37:51,997
This way.

631
00:38:09,416 --> 00:38:10,783
Glass jaw.

632
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:13,155
Now I know
why you wear a helmet.

633
00:38:13,192 --> 00:38:14,661
Up here!

634
00:38:20,476 --> 00:38:22,777
The hunt has resumed.

635
00:38:22,814 --> 00:38:24,113
Come on.

636
00:38:24,151 --> 00:38:25,985
Your ship's ready.

637
00:38:44,767 --> 00:38:48,003
Security reports a fight
in the Promenade. Here.

638
00:38:48,042 --> 00:38:50,206
Apparently,
O'Brien set him loose.

639
00:38:50,247 --> 00:38:53,949
I'm showing someone in an access
conduit above Quark's.

640
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:57,522
Two life-forms.

641
00:38:57,565 --> 00:38:59,502
One's human.

642
00:38:59,536 --> 00:39:01,632
They're heading out
toward the docking ring.

643
00:39:01,675 --> 00:39:03,669
I'll seal off
the adjoining corridors.

644
00:39:03,713 --> 00:39:04,807
They won't get far.

645
00:39:04,849 --> 00:39:05,908
Constable...

646
00:39:07,889 --> 00:39:09,324
there's no hurry.

647
00:39:35,155 --> 00:39:36,556
Here.

648
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:53,154
Now you are Tosk
as well, Oh Brien.

649
00:40:00,549 --> 00:40:02,018
The Cardies made these conduits

650
00:40:02,052 --> 00:40:03,920
from two-meter thick
duranium composite.

651
00:40:03,957 --> 00:40:05,483
I've never seen
a scanning device

652
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:06,690
that could penetrate it.

653
00:40:06,731 --> 00:40:09,100
Ah!

654
00:40:09,136 --> 00:40:10,571
Till now.

655
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:36,732
Come on, Tosk.

656
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:38,831
Around this next corner
and we're there.

657
00:40:39,576 --> 00:40:43,108
No, he is mine.

658
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,697
No!

659
00:40:59,923 --> 00:41:01,517
Go on.

660
00:41:17,298 --> 00:41:18,460
What now?

661
00:41:20,473 --> 00:41:22,444
The hunt...

662
00:41:22,478 --> 00:41:24,209
goes on.

663
00:41:27,055 --> 00:41:28,718
You wish to come?

664
00:41:28,759 --> 00:41:30,422
Oh, no, no.

665
00:41:30,463 --> 00:41:31,955
I don't think so.

666
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,335
One day as a Tosk
is enough for me

667
00:41:34,372 --> 00:41:35,773
and I've got a wife and kid

668
00:41:35,809 --> 00:41:38,338
that wouldn't fit too well
into this lifestyle.

669
00:41:39,652 --> 00:41:43,115
Will your Federation
punish you for helping me?

670
00:41:43,161 --> 00:41:46,499
Maybe. But if I know
my Commander...

671
00:41:46,535 --> 00:41:49,508
Hell, those guys
wanted a hunt.

672
00:41:49,542 --> 00:41:51,171
I just gave them one.

673
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,354
Go on.

674
00:41:56,392 --> 00:41:58,863
You better get out of here
while you still can.

675
00:41:58,898 --> 00:42:00,629
Oh Brien.

676
00:42:07,786 --> 00:42:12,753
Die with honor...

677
00:42:12,798 --> 00:42:14,894
Oh Brien.

678
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:22,953
Die with honor, Tosk.

679
00:42:48,215 --> 00:42:49,684
Just what did happen

680
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,089
at that security
checkpoint, Chief?

681
00:42:52,125 --> 00:42:54,187
The weapons' sensors
must have overloaded

682
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:55,722
on all his various gear, sir.

683
00:42:55,767 --> 00:42:56,735
Must have?

684
00:42:56,769 --> 00:42:57,759
Yes, sir.

685
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:04,015
"Must have," since
I increased their output

686
00:43:04,054 --> 00:43:05,455
by about 200%.

687
00:43:05,491 --> 00:43:07,462
So in effect,
you assaulted him...

688
00:43:07,495 --> 00:43:09,728
our first contact
with a new species.

689
00:43:09,801 --> 00:43:11,134
Yes, sir.

690
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:13,074
We've got dozens
of top-level officials

691
00:43:13,109 --> 00:43:14,373
back at Starfleet Command

692
00:43:14,412 --> 00:43:15,972
eagerly waiting to hear
about our encounter

693
00:43:16,016 --> 00:43:18,249
with the first new life-forms
to come through the wormhole.

694
00:43:18,288 --> 00:43:20,156
How do you suggest
I write up this report?

695
00:43:20,192 --> 00:43:23,633
Well, sir, I'm not
one to say, but...

696
00:43:23,668 --> 00:43:25,764
well, you know

697
00:43:25,806 --> 00:43:27,503
these hunters
weren't any happier

698
00:43:27,543 --> 00:43:29,639
than we were at having
to bring Tosk home.

699
00:43:29,682 --> 00:43:32,119
It seems to me,
in the interests

700
00:43:32,155 --> 00:43:34,558
of mutual understanding
and future relations...

701
00:43:34,593 --> 00:43:35,789
Save it.

702
00:43:35,897 --> 00:43:37,891
You ignored your duty
to Starfleet.

703
00:43:37,935 --> 00:43:40,635
You took off your combadge,
so you could ignore me.

704
00:43:40,675 --> 00:43:43,477
You even ignored the Prime
Directive by interfering

705
00:43:43,515 --> 00:43:44,814
with their damned hunt.

706
00:43:44,852 --> 00:43:45,911
Another stunt like this

707
00:43:45,954 --> 00:43:47,617
and your wife won't have
to complain

708
00:43:47,659 --> 00:43:49,219
about the conditions
here anymore.

709
00:43:49,262 --> 00:43:51,460
Do I make myself clear?

710
00:43:51,501 --> 00:43:53,335
I understand.

711
00:43:58,885 --> 00:44:01,356
I was surprised
by one thing, sir.

712
00:44:01,391 --> 00:44:02,621
What's that?

713
00:44:02,661 --> 00:44:04,757
Well, I knew I couldn't override

714
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,432
all the security seals
in the station

715
00:44:07,472 --> 00:44:11,345
and I figured once you
and the Constable located us

716
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:13,546
well, it'd be over.

717
00:44:13,587 --> 00:44:15,181
We'd find ourselves

718
00:44:15,224 --> 00:44:18,425
locked behind
some force field somewhere.

719
00:44:18,466 --> 00:44:21,598
I guess that one got by us.

720
00:44:24,213 --> 00:44:26,343
Yes, sir.

721
00:44:26,385 --> 00:44:28,253
Thank you, sir.

722
00:44:28,289 --> 00:44:29,553
Dismissed.
