1
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,843
I'm not what a lot
of people think.

2
00:00:08,843 --> 00:00:11,303
I mean, if you're
a dabo girl,

3
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:13,806
you know, you get
a reputation.

4
00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:16,308
Miss Sarda, why don't you
tell me exactly what happened.

5
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:19,186
When did you start to
have trouble with Quark?

6
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:21,730
About five minutes
after I got off the ship.

7
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,607
He immediately made
sexual advances?

8
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,693
He said it was
part of the job.

9
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,486
And what did you say?

10
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:29,530
I told him
I'd wear the costume

11
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,323
and entertain the gamblers

12
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:33,701
but to keep his Ferengi
knuckles to himself.

13
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:35,118
That didn't stop him?

14
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,496
No. He said again that
it was part of the job.

15
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:40,207
He showed me
my employment agreement.

16
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:42,877
See, there it is
in the Ferengi print--

17
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:47,214
page 21, subsection D,
paragraph 12.

18
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:51,010
You're telling me the contract
you signed requires you to...

19
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,345
I guess I should have
read it more carefully.

20
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:55,180
I'm not a legal expert,
Commander.

21
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,975
I'm not a legal expert either,
but I can assure you

22
00:00:57,975 --> 00:00:59,768
after I talk to Quark

23
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:02,604
he won't hold you or anyone else
to this provision concerning...

24
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,857
KIRA:
Commander, sensors
are picking up

25
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:06,567
elevated neutrino readings.

26
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:08,986
Something's coming
through the wormhole.

27
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:10,362
Excuse me.

28
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:12,031
Thank you, Commander.

29
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:14,533
Are any of the transports
due back?

30
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:16,368
Not according to our logs.

31
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:17,953
Put us on Yellow Alert.

32
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,923
It doesn't match anything
in Starfleet files.

33
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:30,549
I'm getting readings
of a massive energy flux.

34
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:33,802
It could be damaged.

35
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,847
Sensors indicate a single
humanoid life-form on board.

36
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:38,265
Hail it.

37
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,059
Aye, sir.

38
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:43,186
Hail acknowledged.
Response coming in.

39
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,813
On screen.

40
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,232
Welcome to
the Alpha Quadrant.

41
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,901
I'm Commander Benjamin Sisko

42
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:50,945
of the United Federation
of Planets.

43
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:52,947
Alpha Quadrant?

44
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:55,824
You've passed through a wormhole
into a new part of the galaxy.

45
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,701
I saw a small ship disappear.

46
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:58,911
I followed it.

47
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:00,871
That was one
of our patrol vessels.

48
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:03,457
You've traveled almost
90,000 light years.

49
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,000
What planet
do you come from?

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,086
How long does it last,
this anomaly?

51
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:08,295
It's stable.

52
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,672
You can return
whenever you want to.

53
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,173
In the meantime,
you're welcome to dock here

54
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,801
and we'll try
to answer all your questions.

55
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:16,595
No. No time.

56
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:17,972
O'BRIEN:
Inertial stress

57
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:19,807
is overloading
his structural capacity.

58
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:21,809
Prepare to transport him
off his ship.

59
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:23,936
I will not abandon my vessel.

60
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:25,353
Sir, your ship
is in danger of...

61
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,022
I will not leave!

62
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:28,816
We can use a tractor beam
to tow him in.

63
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,484
The beam's
graviton field

64
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,694
should shore up the
structural integrity.

65
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:33,654
Do it.

66
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:34,655
Cut your engines.

67
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,031
Why?

68
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,241
So I can save your ship, friend.

69
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,618
We'll bring you in

70
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:41,369
try to fix you up
as good as new.

71
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,083
(<i> engines power down</i> )

72
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,542
Good.

73
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:48,961
Engaging
tractor beam.

74
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,378
Steady, now.

75
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,298
You feel the graviton field

76
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,258
taking hold?

77
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,635
Yes.

78
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,720
You'll be fine now.

79
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,349
Just relax and enjoy the ride.

80
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,894
I think we might want to skip

81
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,312
formal first-contact
procedures for now.

82
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,939
Agreed.

83
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:12,526
Why don't you meet him
by yourself

84
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,569
at the airlock, Mr. O'Brien?

85
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,113
He might find that

86
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,823
a little less
intimidating.

87
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:18,949
Aye, sir.

88
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:21,869
And, if you can...

89
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:25,288
find out what he's
so nervous about.

90
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,748
Aye, sir.

91
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,985
O'Brien to Ops.

92
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:01,402
SISKO:
Go ahead, Chief.

93
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:03,571
Sure you didn't

94
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,448
beam this fellow out
when I wasn't looking?

95
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,534
Negative.

96
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:08,952
He's not in here.

97
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,540
Sensors say he's still
on board, Chief.

98
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:21,756
Friend... if you're in here

99
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,591
you've got nothing
to worry about from me.

100
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:26,178
Understand?

101
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:39,107
I'm just going to take
a look at your ship,

102
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,943
see what the problem is, okay?

103
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,286
And just to let you know,
I'm an engineer.

104
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:56,415
I know a little bit about ships.

105
00:06:56,415 --> 00:07:00,170
Well, more than a little,
actually.

106
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,463
Though I'll tell you

107
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:05,466
I've never seen anything
close to this.

108
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:09,512
All right, then.

109
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,974
Is this some sort
of plasma injector?

110
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:16,477
Okay, then...

111
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:21,691
then that must be an off-axis
field controller over there.

112
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:22,984
Uh-huh.

113
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,694
Uh-huh.

114
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:28,615
The coladrium flow
has been damaged.
Oh!

115
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:31,785
You can't go sneaking up
on someone like that, friend.

116
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,412
It's an Alpha Quadrant rule.

117
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,376
Can it be repaired?

118
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,502
Well, that all depends.

119
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,213
Depends?

120
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:47,759
On what exactly
a coladrium flow is.

121
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,303
On my world, it
would be simple.

122
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,763
With proper materials,
I could do it myself.

123
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,056
Hang on.

124
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,183
I didn't say we
couldn't figure it out.

125
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,769
You're just going to have
to teach me as we go.

126
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,229
I'm sure that we can...

127
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,064
I have no time.

128
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,316
I know.

129
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,276
Everyone's in a
hurry these days.

130
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:05,652
We'll have you
on your way

131
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,154
as soon as it's
humanly possible.

132
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:10,031
That's me, by the way--
human species.

133
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,159
Name's O'Brien.

134
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,369
Oh Brien.

135
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:17,038
Miles O'Brien,
Chief of Operations.

136
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,415
How about you?

137
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:21,418
I am Tosk.

138
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:25,005
That's your name
or your species?

139
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,675
I am Tosk.

140
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:29,926
Oh.

141
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,553
Tosk it is.

142
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,597
Come on.

143
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:41,229
There's nothing to be
afraid of out there.

144
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,065
We've got to wait
for your reactor
to cool down anyway

145
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,525
before we can
do anything else.

146
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:47,944
Come on.

147
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:55,576
I've got work to do.

148
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,096
So, what happened
to you, anyway?

149
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,223
Looks like you took

150
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,640
some sort of a shock
to your hull.

151
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,852
The passage through
the anomaly was very rough.

152
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:22,979
Yeah, sure.

153
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,148
The wormhole can
shake you up, all right.

154
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,658
(<i> alarm beeping</i> )

155
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,327
Security sensor.

156
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,037
Screens for weapons.

157
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,872
It's just picking up my phaser.

158
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:43,083
You're fine.

159
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,465
You wear a weapon.

160
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,551
Defensive
purposes only.

161
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:54,761
It may not
seem hospitable,

162
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,055
but when you go
into an alien ship
for the first time,

163
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:59,724
you never know what
might be in there.

164
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,435
You may even
find someone

165
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,353
who can make
himself invisible.

166
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,522
You know what I mean?

167
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,782
I understand.

168
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,999
A health center?

169
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,502
Yeah. That's Dr. Bashir.

170
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:30,464
He looks after
our medical problems.

171
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,469
How many live here?

172
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:38,138
Well, 300, more or less.

173
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,432
What is its purpose?

174
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,350
Purpose?

175
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,018
Defense?

176
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,770
Surveillance?

177
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,565
Well, sometimes,
when I walk along here

178
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,650
I feel like we're
the flea market

179
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,692
to the sector.

180
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:52,652
(<i> chuckles</i> )

181
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,071
But I guess
our real job

182
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,449
is to keep an eye
on the wormhole.

183
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:01,244
There's traffic
going in and out
all the time now.

184
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,204
Many ships dock here.

185
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,705
Five or six a week.

186
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,542
We sometimes
have a whole convoy

187
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,877
on its way
through the wormhole.

188
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,921
But you
have the honor

189
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,966
of being the
first visitor
from the other side.

190
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:18,386
Others will detect ships
from your quadrant, as I did,

191
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,929
and follow them here.

192
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,473
We hope so.

193
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:23,475
Our mission as
Starfleet officers

194
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:25,684
is to seek out
new life-forms

195
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:27,354
so we can learn
about each other.

196
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,230
QUARK:
Madam,

197
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,689
I distinctly saw you

198
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:32,066
move your wager
to the green line

199
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:35,320
after the play
was completed.

200
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,614
I will return
your currency

201
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:40,908
but you will promptly
leave the establishment.

202
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:43,453
You are not
welcome here.

203
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,583
Well, there are
some things

204
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,169
to learn about us
that can wait.

205
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,674
How about you?

206
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:59,219
You an explorer?
A scientist?

207
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,262
I am Tosk.

208
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,265
Right.

209
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,061
Computer, lights.

210
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:15,318
Oh, I wasn't
the decorator.

211
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:18,613
I wish to begin work
on my ship.

212
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:21,533
Yes, well, we'll start
as soon as we can.

213
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:24,785
Now, why don't
you get some rest?

214
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,872
I require only 17 minutes
of sleep per rotation.

215
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,624
17? No kidding?

216
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:32,419
If I don't get a good
eight hours a night

217
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,254
I'm not the same man.

218
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,880
Are you hungry?

219
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,257
Hungry?

220
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,676
You know, would
you like to eat?

221
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,386
Take in sustenance.

222
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,012
Liquid nutrients
are stored

223
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,265
in plasmic fibers
throughout my body.

224
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,849
Oh.

225
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,436
Well, this is the food
replicator over here

226
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,479
in case you
change your mind.

227
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,481
We finally got it making

228
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,358
a pretty good bowl
of oatmeal.

229
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:58,903
Just ask the computer
if you need anything else.

230
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,865
Oh Brien...

231
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,992
thank you.

232
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:08,246
As the Vulcans say,
we're here to serve.

233
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:10,331
(<i> door opens</i> )

234
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,461
(<i> door closes</i> )

235
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,433
Computer...

236
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,268
State request.

237
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:33,854
I wish to see a display
of this facility.

238
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:37,692
Specify exterior
or interior display.

239
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:39,902
Interior.

240
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:43,364
Interior display available
in 19 sections.

241
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,659
Specify requirements.

242
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:48,703
Show me where
the weapons are stored.

243
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:53,374
Habitat ring, level five,
section three.

244
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:57,712
Access restricted to security
clearance 7 and above.

245
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,098
It's hard to say, sir.

246
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,058
You hate to
prejudge anyone.

247
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:13,227
What are you
thinking, Chief?

248
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,729
You know the old saying--

249
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,606
"A man who's always
looking over his shoulder

250
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,358
is waiting for trouble
to find him."

251
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,651
You think he's on the run?

252
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,902
I'll tell you this--
he wasn't telling

253
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:24,113
the whole truth
about the damage
to his ship.

254
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,616
It sure wasn't caused
by the wormhole.

255
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,326
Somebody took
a shot at him.

256
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:31,245
It came in at
a 45-degree angle
to the hull,

257
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:34,915
sliced through two
propulsion systems.

258
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,959
I'll know more when
I get a better look at it.

259
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,547
Stay with him as much
as possible while he's here.

260
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:43,090
I'll tell Odo
to keep an eye on him, too.

261
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,175
Aye, sir.

262
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:52,767
TOSK:
No. The coladrium flows
through the arva nodes.

263
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,227
O'BRIEN:
What are they?

264
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,688
Some kind of high-energy
magnetic coils?

265
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:58,439
TOSK:
For fuel replenishment.

266
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,358
Fuel?
Oh, like a ramscoop.

267
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:01,776
Ramscoop?

268
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:04,028
Yeah, to capture
stellar gasses

269
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,406
and convert them
into usable fuel.

270
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,743
Yes. The arva nodes convert
space matter into fuel.

271
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:12,245
Ah, gotcha.

272
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,163
Mm, piece of cake.

273
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:17,166
Piece of cake.
Ramscoop. Arva nodes.

274
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,211
"Piece of cake"-- it's
an old human expression.

275
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:22,756
It means they'll be
easy to fix.

276
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,549
They will be
easy to fix?

277
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,092
Sure. Yeah.

278
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,636
We'll just get my crew
to remove your arva nodes

279
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,264
then we'll take them over
to the replicator center

280
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,306
and make new ones.

281
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,101
Piece of cake.

282
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,356
How long?

283
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,692
Oh...

284
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,861
maybe a day or two.

285
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,279
We'll want to
run some tests

286
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,365
after the replacement
unit's in.

287
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,033
No. No time for that.

288
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,828
Hey, I let you
take that unit out

289
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,413
without proper testing

290
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,290
it breaks down,
you blame me.

291
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,917
Next thing I know

292
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:00,668
my work has
a bad reputation

293
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,587
in the Gamma Quadrant.

294
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:05,506
I would not blame you.

295
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,926
I was joking, Tosk.

296
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:10,845
I cannot tell... Oh Brien.

297
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:13,222
Sorry, it's
in my nature.

298
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,516
And you're the most
natural straight man

299
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,977
I've met in ages.

300
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,688
Come on, while the
fellas are working here

301
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,107
I'll buy you a drink
and you can tell me

302
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,901
why you're in
such a rush.

303
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:29,071
PLAYER:
Dabo!

304
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,699
(<i> players cheering</i> )

305
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:36,788
(<i> laughing</i> )

306
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:46,506
Nothing like this
exists on my world.

307
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:49,926
This is where we do
most of our R&amp;R.

308
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,679
What is "R&amp;R"?

309
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,472
Rest and relaxation.

310
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,432
You know, down time.

311
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,685
When we're
not working.

312
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:02,856
You sleep a full third
of your rotation.

313
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:07,568
You rest and relax
while you are awake.

314
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:11,698
Alpha Quadrant has
far too much down time.

315
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,157
(<i> chuckles</i> )

316
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,326
My wife would laugh
at that.

317
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:18,371
She's barely seen me
in the last three weeks.

318
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:22,583
We are very different,

319
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,586
Tosk and Oh Brien.

320
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,171
I've noticed.

321
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:30,090
Hey, barkeep!

322
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,676
Don't call me "barkeep."

323
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:32,844
I'm not a barkeep.

324
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:35,429
I'm your host.

325
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,806
The proprietor.

326
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,182
A sympathetic ear
to the wretched souls

327
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,559
that pass through
these portals.

328
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,644
And a man who
will exploit

329
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:44,397
any vice
you may have.

330
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:47,191
Two synthales,
barkeep.

331
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,442
I am sorry.

332
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:51,529
I have no vices
for you to exploit.

333
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,448
A challenge.

334
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,701
Tosk is our
first guest

335
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,828
from the Gamma
Quadrant, Quark.

336
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,705
I'd take him
at his word.

337
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:04,709
Perhaps a short adventure
in a holosuite?

338
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:07,003
Holosuite?

339
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:12,258
A fantasy encounter with
danger, romance, thrills,

340
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,761
created for
your personal entertainment

341
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,387
by the brothers Quark.

342
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:20,683
I have no use for
fantasy adventure.

343
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:23,102
I live the
greatest adventure

344
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,729
one could
ever desire.

345
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:27,481
(<i> gasping</i> )

346
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:30,568
Then I envy you, Mr. Tosk.

347
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:43,122
What are you talking
about, Tosk?

348
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:47,334
What is this adventure
you're on?

349
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:50,254
I cannot discuss it.

350
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,548
Oh, sure.

351
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,758
Of course.

352
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,476
Sounds like you've changed
your mind about him, Chief.

353
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,061
Not exactly.

354
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:08,022
I mean he's running from
something, that's for sure.

355
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:09,482
And he's in danger.

356
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:12,234
And he can't, or won't
talk about it.

357
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,444
People tell
doctors things

358
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:15,029
they wouldn't
tell anyone else.

359
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,322
If you could
get him to have

360
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,074
a routine medical
examination, maybe I...

361
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:21,077
The thing is, I kind
of like the guy.

362
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,996
I'm not even sure why.

363
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:25,748
In a way, he's
almost naive.

364
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:29,836
I guess anyone would be
in an alien environment,

365
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,963
but I don't sense a threat
of criminal intent

366
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:33,673
or dishonesty
about him.

367
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:34,841
I thought you said
he lied about

368
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,676
the damage
to his ship.

369
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,845
He didn't exactly lie.

370
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:42,932
But he didn't exactly
tell the truth either.

371
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:45,018
He keeps the truth
pretty much to himself.

372
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:47,186
SISKO:
When do you think his
ship will be ready?

373
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,104
Tomorrow.

374
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,148
I don't see
that we have

375
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:51,440
much of a choice.

376
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,817
We can't hold him.

377
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:55,736
If he wants to tell
you the truth, fine.

378
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:58,156
If not...

379
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:01,159
wish him well
and send him on his way.

380
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:32,732
Just what do you
think you're doing?

381
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:40,489
Computer, seal off
corridor 14-A, Habitat Level 5.

382
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,949
COMPUTER:
Seal confirmed.

383
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,827
Security to Habitat 514-A.

384
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,871
(<i> air swishing</i> )

385
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,175
When you get tired
of bouncing

386
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:01,219
off force fields,
we can talk, all right?

387
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:04,638
I did nothing to you.

388
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,474
It's that security junction
I'm curious about.

389
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,894
I must prepare.

390
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:11,729
For what?

391
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:13,480
I cannot discuss it.

392
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,815
I am Tosk.

393
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:18,027
I'm sure you are.

394
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,695
Why don't we go down
to my office

395
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,281
while your friend,
Chief O'Brien takes a look

396
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,450
to see just what you've
been doing in there?

397
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,995
Oh Brien?
Right.

398
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:31,582
I'm going to release
the force fields now.

399
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:35,253
I don't need a fight
from you, understand?

400
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:37,088
I will not fight you.

401
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:39,381
Good.

402
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:43,094
Computer, release
the security seals.

403
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,957
I cannot
discuss it.

404
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:14,667
And I can't accept
that as an answer.

405
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,543
I did nothing to you.

406
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,545
SISKO:
You were tampering
with the security grid.

407
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:19,964
I consider that
a threat.

408
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:22,591
I think he was trying
to shut out the lock-outs

409
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,550
to section three.

410
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,927
The weapons
locker.

411
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,929
What were you going
to do with the weapons?

412
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:28,931
ODO:
Are you wanted
by authorities

413
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:30,599
somewhere
in the Gamma Quadrant?

414
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,935
"Wanted?"

415
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:34,603
Have you
committed crimes?

416
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,858
Never. I am Tosk.

417
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,818
SISKO:
What does<i> that</i> mean?

418
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:43,070
Is that supposed
to explain all this?

419
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,281
It is all I can say.

420
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:48,201
Tosk, don't you think
we deserve some answers?

421
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:50,661
ODO:
What should I
do with him?

422
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:52,205
Hold him for now.

423
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:53,497
We'll wait to see

424
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,333
if someone shows up
looking for him.

425
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,514
Enough of this craziness, Tosk.

426
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:13,100
Tell me, what were you doing?

427
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:17,897
Oh Brien...
you must let me out.

428
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,899
Tell me.

429
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,776
Allow me to die with honor.

430
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,402
Die?

431
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:27,698
Who would want
to kill you, Tosk?

432
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:36,790
Allow me to die with honor.

433
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:45,049
He's climbing the walls
like a trapped animal.

434
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:49,345
I'm sorry our jail cells
aren't to his liking.

435
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:51,680
Somehow, I feel responsible.

436
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,515
You do?

437
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:58,145
Yeah, well, I guess
I kind of adopted him.

438
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,397
I talked him into coming

439
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:00,398
on board.

440
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:01,648
You didn't talk him

441
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:04,277
into breaking
into the security system.

442
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:06,444
I just feel sorry for him.

443
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:09,907
Somehow, I don't think
he means us any harm.

444
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:13,577
(<i> sighs</i> )

445
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,788
What the hell is his secret?

446
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:27,507
Sensors are picking up
ionized L-band emissions.

447
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:29,718
The patterns
match Tosk's ship.

448
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,846
Hail them. Maybe we'll
finally get a few answers.

449
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:35,099
No response.

450
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:37,226
Again, rotate frequencies.

451
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:40,980
It's a modulated
particle beam.

452
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,064
It's scanning us.

453
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:43,107
Ready shields.

454
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:44,358
Not yet, Major.

455
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:45,692
Let them have
a good look at us.

456
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,694
I'm reading phased
power fluctuations.

457
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,738
They may be readying a
transporter of some kind.

458
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,657
Now, Major.
Shields up.

459
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:52,783
SISKO:
Open all hailing channels.

460
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,160
Open.

461
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,869
This is Commander Benjamin Sisko
of the United...

462
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,079
<i>( rumbling )</i>

463
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,789
O'BRIEN:
They're bombarding us

464
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:00,249
with some kind of radiation
I've never seen before.

465
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:02,668
Very rapid magnetic
flux variations.

466
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,091
What the...?

467
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:11,302
They've reversed
the polarity
of our shields.

468
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:13,262
I'm picking up
transporter locks.

469
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:14,763
They're beaming on board.

470
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:15,764
Location?

471
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,724
Promenade.

472
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,393
Security to the Promenade.

473
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:20,978
Kira and O'Brien with me.

474
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:22,688
Dax, you have Ops.

475
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:42,082
Ready phasers.

476
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,553
I'm Commander
of this station.

477
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:57,056
Put down your weapons.

(<i> groans</i> )

479
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,208
Increase setting to level six.

480
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:26,043
It's that Tosk
they're after.

481
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:28,003
Maybe they have
a right to him.

482
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,256
Nobody's abducting a
prisoner out of my brig

483
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:31,715
as long as I'm alive.

484
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:34,801
You may need this.

485
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:35,844
Thanks, Major.

486
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,012
You know I
never use them.

487
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,406
(<i> coughs</i> )

488
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,552
I have Tosk...

489
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:00,554
...alive.

490
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:03,015
It is over.

491
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:14,485
What a disappointment.

492
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,447
And after such
an entertaining beginning.

493
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:19,865
Entertaining?!

494
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:22,868
These aliens gave us
a great deal of resistance.

495
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,037
We wondered how you got
their cooperation

496
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:27,540
without violating
your oath of silence.

497
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,748
I told them nothing.

498
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:33,504
But to see you here...

499
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:35,339
caged...

500
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:37,799
helpless...

501
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,926
how could you allow this?

502
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:42,388
It is a disgrace
to all Tosk

503
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:45,265
and the most disappointing
hunt in memory.

504
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,476
You're saying that this
whole thing is a hunt,

505
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:50,145
and Tosk is the prey?

506
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,442
You are right.

507
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:59,697
This Tosk is unworthy
of such a noble description.

508
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,452
For this<i> dishonor,</i>
you will endure

509
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,496
the greatest humiliation

510
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,122
Tosk can know--

511
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:13,669
to be captured
and brought home alive.

512
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:17,339
You will live out your existence
on public display

513
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:18,882
where children
can make fun of you,

514
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,843
toss you scraps of food,

515
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:24,054
which is more
than you deserve.

516
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:26,390
(<i> grunts</i> )

517
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,933
Release him.

518
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:30,644
You've disrupted
life on this station

519
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:33,146
for the pleasure
of your "hunt"?

520
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:35,815
I'm not inclined to
take orders from you.

521
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:37,443
Odo, watch the prisoner

522
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:40,696
while our guest and I
discuss this in private.

523
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:43,073
Unless you intend
to take him by force,

524
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:45,033
in which case, I'm
prepared to give orders

525
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,660
to open fire
on your ship.

526
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,869
Over this Tosk?!

527
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:00,006
(<i> snorts</i> )

528
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,659
Have you nothing similar

529
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:28,327
in your own society?

530
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:30,704
Centuries ago, people on my
world engaged in blood sports--

531
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:32,498
killing lower species
for pleasure.

532
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:34,124
A few cultures still do,

533
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:37,127
but even they wouldn't consider
hunting a sentient being.

534
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:41,131
But he is sentient only because
we have made him sentient.

535
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:44,301
He has been bred
for the hunt.

536
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:47,012
His entire reason
to exist is the hunt--

537
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:52,225
to make it as exciting,
as interesting as he can.

538
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,311
Obviously, you
do not comprehend.

539
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:56,104
I comprehend just fine.

540
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:59,399
I have no tolerance for
the abuse of any life-form.

541
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,276
Abuse?

542
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,989
We honor Tosk.

543
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,659
They are the symbol of all

544
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:11,453
that is noble and courageous.

545
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:14,122
They train and
condition themselves

546
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:19,044
all their lives
for this event.

547
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:24,299
They're proud of their role
in our culture.

548
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:28,721
I can't judge what is right
and wrong for your world,

549
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:31,348
but on this station...

550
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:37,563
In the future,
passage through the anomaly

551
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:40,440
will be considered
out of bounds for the hunt.

552
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,067
Will that satisfy you?

553
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:51,201
Now, you will arrange
for release of the Tosk.

554
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,169
I've agreed to release him.

555
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:05,758
But, sir, Tosk is
an intelligent, living being.

556
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:07,008
It's their custom, Chief.

557
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,343
Under the Prime Directive

558
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,053
we have no right to interfere.

559
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:13,265
What if Tosk were
to request asylum?

560
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,108
If he asks for it.

561
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:35,871
All right,
I have a way out for you.

562
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:38,874
A way out...

563
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,542
of here?

564
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:42,586
Request asylum.

565
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:44,504
Asylum.

566
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,924
You ask for the protection
of the Federation.

567
00:32:46,924 --> 00:32:49,134
You understand?

568
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,511
My Commander is willing
to protect you.

569
00:32:55,849 --> 00:33:00,854
Oh Brien, I am Tosk.

570
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:03,649
I cannot hide here

571
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:07,152
behind the protection
of your Federation.

572
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:10,113
It is against
everything I believe.

573
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,448
You'd rather go back

574
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:13,951
and live in a cage
on public display?

575
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:17,913
To stay would be
a greater dishonor.

576
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:20,749
I am Tosk,

577
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:23,001
the hunted.

578
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:28,966
I live to outwit the hunters
for another day,

579
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:33,303
to survive
until I die with honor.

580
00:33:43,981 --> 00:33:46,817
But that will not be my fate.

581
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:56,201
But I will not deny
my existence as Tosk.

582
00:33:57,703 --> 00:34:01,164
Thank you, Oh Brien...

583
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:12,676
but I cannot request asylum.

584
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,906
So far, I'm not impressed
with the tourist trade

585
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:35,741
from the Gamma Quadrant.

586
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:36,950
Not one of them has
bought a single drink.

587
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,159
Shut up, Quark.

588
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:42,330
More trouble with
the little woman.

589
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,833
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing, nothing.

590
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,418
I just thought you
might want to talk.

591
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,795
There is nothing wrong
between my wife and I.

592
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:51,006
And if there were,
I sure as hell

593
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:53,675
wouldn't want to talk
to some barkeep about it.

594
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:55,969
Sorry. My mistake.

595
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:00,849
What?!

596
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:04,811
Your face gets very...

597
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:08,732
pink when it
gets aggravated.

598
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:10,734
Much more so than
most other humans.

599
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:11,777
So stop aggravating me.

600
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:12,945
Oh, not me.

601
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:15,072
You came in the
door this way.

602
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,489
Fine. You're right,
I'm aggravated.

603
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,742
I am a keen observer
of behavior.

604
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:19,785
You want to talk
about it?

605
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:20,786
No.

606
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:22,287
Why not?

607
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:24,664
Because it wouldn't do
any good talking to you.

608
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,919
Try me.

609
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:30,336
Forget it.

610
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:33,339
It's just the
rules of the game.

611
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:34,716
Uh-huh.

612
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:38,511
Rules of the game.
Go on.

613
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:39,763
It's a hunt.

614
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:41,139
Did you know that?

615
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,642
They're chasing
Tosk in a hunt,

616
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:44,977
and everybody's
playing by the rules.

617
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:46,269
They're playing
by their rules

618
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,479
we're playing by ours,

619
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,188
and he's caught
in the middle.

620
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,482
'Course, I suppose

621
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:51,650
if the Ferengi don't
like the rules

622
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,110
they just change them.

623
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,320
Well, rules, rules
are always subject to...

624
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,905
Of course.

625
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,534
Change the rules.

626
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,331
Why didn't I
think of that?

627
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,460
Thanks, barkeep.

628
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:20,762
So... what's
bothering<i> you</i> today?

629
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:21,805
(<i> groans</i> )

630
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:32,315
Computer,
access the power grid

631
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:35,568
to Security Checkpoint 4
on the Promenade.

632
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:41,741
That isn't necessary.

633
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,493
Our ritual
requires it

634
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:45,453
when a Tosk is
captured alive.

635
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,622
All right, let's go.

636
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:50,917
<i>I'll</i> escort the prisoner
to the transporter station.

637
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,460
This is a
security matter.

638
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,295
This is
a<i> Starfleet</i> matter.

639
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:55,630
Orders from Sisko.

640
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,675
We'll see
about that.

641
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:00,802
Do not trouble yourself.

642
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,428
My ship will
transport us.

643
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:04,263
No, sir, that
won't be necessary.

644
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:06,599
Good relations
with other cultures

645
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,143
is our highest priority.

646
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:09,811
Commander Sisko
wants to make sure

647
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:11,479
you understand
we're sorry

648
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,815
we interfered
with your hunt.

649
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:15,150
The least we
can do is give you

650
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,610
an official escort
off the station.

651
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:23,200
It's a token of goodwill
and respect in our society.

652
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,119
Very well.

653
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:33,919
Starfleet has no business

654
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:35,921
taking charge
of a prisoner transport.

655
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:38,131
Calm down, Constable,
what are you talking about?

656
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:39,966
I'm talking about
you ordering O'Brien

657
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,718
to escort Tosk
off the station.

658
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:44,096
I didn't give him
any orders at all.

659
00:37:44,096 --> 00:37:47,473
Sisko to O'Brien.

660
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:50,268
Mr. O'Brien,
report to Ops immediately.

661
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,811
This way.

662
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,199
(<i> screams</i> )

663
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:10,538
Glass jaw.

664
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,540
Now I know why
you wear a helmet.

665
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,000
Up here!

666
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,592
The hunt has resumed.

667
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:24,803
Come on.
Your ship's ready.

668
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,768
(<i> whirring whoosh</i>
<i>of alien transport</i> )

669
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:37,607
(<i> yelling</i> )

670
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:48,034
Security reports a fight
in the Promenade. Here.

671
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,203
Apparently,
O'Brien set him loose.

672
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:53,873
DAX:
I'm showing someone in an access
conduit above Quark's.

673
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:57,502
Two life-forms.

674
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:59,420
One's human.

675
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,631
They're heading out
toward the docking ring.

676
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:03,633
I'll seal off the
adjoining corridors.

677
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:04,676
They won't get far.

678
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:05,885
Constable...

679
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,139
there's no hurry.

680
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,374
Here.

681
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:53,058
Now you are Tosk
as well, Oh Brien.

682
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:54,100
(<i> chuckles</i> )

683
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,067
The Cardies made these conduits

684
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:03,902
from two-meter thick
duranium composite.

685
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,486
I've never seen
a scanning device

686
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:06,445
that could penetrate it.

687
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:08,948
Ah!

688
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,491
Till now.

689
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,035
(<i> yells</i> )

690
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,559
Come on, Tosk.

691
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,603
Around this next corner
and we're there.

692
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:42,941
No, he is mine.

693
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,405
No!

694
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:51,783
(<i> yelling</i> )

695
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:01,960
Go on.

696
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:18,935
What now?

697
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,897
The hunt...

698
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,607
goes on.

699
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,820
You wish to come?

700
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,363
Oh, no, no.

701
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:31,990
I don't think so.

702
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,409
One day as a Tosk
is enough for me.

703
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:35,701
And I've got
a wife and kid

704
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:37,287
that wouldn't
fit too well

705
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:38,330
into this lifestyle.

706
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:43,251
Will your Federation
punish you for helping me?

707
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:46,463
Maybe. But if I know
my Commander...

708
00:41:46,463 --> 00:41:49,507
Hell, those guys
wanted a hunt.

709
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,092
I just gave them one.

710
00:41:54,471 --> 00:41:56,514
Go on.

711
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,891
You better get out of here
while you still can.

712
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,643
Oh Brien.

713
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:12,864
Die with honor...

714
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:14,782
Oh Brien.

715
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:22,832
Die with honor, Tosk.

716
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:49,817
Just what did happen

717
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:52,111
at that security
checkpoint, Chief?

718
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,322
The weapons' sensors
must have overloaded

719
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:55,698
on all his various gear, sir.

720
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:56,741
Must have?

721
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:57,783
Yes, sir.

722
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:04,082
"Must have," since
I increased their output

723
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:05,583
by about 200%.

724
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,668
So in effect,
you assaulted him--

725
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,837
our first contact
with a new species.

726
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,214
Yes, sir.

727
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:13,216
We've got dozens
of top-level officials

728
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:14,551
back at Starfleet Command

729
00:43:14,551 --> 00:43:16,302
eagerly waiting to hear
about our encounter

730
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,388
with the first new life-forms
to come through the wormhole.

731
00:43:18,388 --> 00:43:20,139
How do you suggest
I write up this report?

732
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:23,601
Well, sir, I'm not
one to say, but...

733
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,895
well, you know

734
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:27,605
these hunters
weren't any happier

735
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,648
than we were at having
to bring Tosk home.

736
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:32,110
It seems to me,
in the interests

737
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:34,529
of mutual understanding
and future relations...

738
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:35,863
Save it.

739
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:38,157
You ignored your duty
to Starfleet.

740
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:40,826
You took off your combadge
so you could ignore me.

741
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:43,413
You even ignored the Prime
Directive by interfering

742
00:43:43,413 --> 00:43:44,830
with their damned hunt.

743
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,040
Another stunt like this

744
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,708
and your wife won't have
to complain

745
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,335
about the conditions
here anymore.

746
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:51,337
Do I make myself clear?

747
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:53,214
I understand.

748
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,431
I was surprised
by one thing, sir.

749
00:44:01,431 --> 00:44:02,681
What's that?

750
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:04,850
Well, I knew I couldn't override

751
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:08,313
all the security seals
in the station,

752
00:44:08,313 --> 00:44:12,066
and I figured once you
and the Constable located us,

753
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:14,193
well, it'd be over.

754
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:15,570
We'd find ourselves

755
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:18,531
locked behind some
force field somewhere.

756
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:21,576
I guess that one got by us.

757
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:26,498
Yes, sir.

758
00:44:26,498 --> 00:44:28,333
Thank you, sir.

759
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:29,501
Dismissed.
