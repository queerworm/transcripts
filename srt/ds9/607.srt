00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:06,298
SISKO:
<i>Captain's Personal Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 51247.5.</i>

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,551
<i>It's been a week since</i>
<i>our return to Deep Space 9,</i>

3
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:12,137
<i>but the mood</i>
<i>of celebration continues.</i>

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,264
<i>We're still at war,</i>
<i>and the station's</i>

5
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:16,308
<i>been designated headquarters</i>
<i>for the Ninth Fleet.</i>

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,435
<i>That, plus</i>
<i>our strategic position</i>

7
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:20,688
<i>guarding the wormhole,</i>
<i>makes DS9</i>

8
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,439
<i>one of the most</i>
<i>tempting targets</i>

9
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:24,065
<i>in the entire quadrant.</i>

10
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:28,069
<i>But for now, at least,</i>
<i>the war seems very far away.</i>

11
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:35,494
Morning.
Good morning.

12
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,329
Good morning.

13
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:38,747
Morning, Major.

14
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:40,541
Good morning, Captain.

15
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,250
Do you know
how much I missed

16
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:43,669
hearing you say that?

17
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:45,796
Do you know how much
I hated saying

18
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:46,881
"Good morning, Dukat"?

19
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:47,882
I can imagine.

20
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:49,299
What's on the agenda?

21
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:52,177
Uh, USS<i> Potemkin</i>
has completed her repairs

22
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:54,262
and is rejoining the fleet
later today.

23
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,015
<i>Exeter, Sutherland</i>
and<i> Agaki</i>

24
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,933
have submitted
resupply requests

25
00:00:57,975 --> 00:00:59,935
and there are
about 1,000 messages

26
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:01,353
from Starfleet Command

27
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,355
awaiting your "eyes-only"
attention.

28
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:04,773
Anything else?

29
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:06,901
General Martok is waiting
in your office.

30
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:08,861
Oh, I'll start
with the General.

31
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:10,278
I thought you would.

32
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:15,242
Have I mentioned
that it's good to be home?

33
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,328
Once or twice.

34
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,082
All right.

35
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:28,087
You knew about this,
didn't you?

36
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,798
Oh, I had a pretty good idea.

37
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,760
And you did nothing to stop it.

38
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,344
No.

39
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:37,180
In fact, I recommended you
for the position myself.

40
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,516
Allow me to offer
my congratulations

41
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:41,351
to the new
Supreme Commander

42
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:42,937
of the Ninth Fleet.

43
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,565
Do you have any idea
how much paperwork

44
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,859
a Supreme Commander
has to do?

45
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:49,860
You're welcome.

46
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:52,071
(<i> growls</i> )

47
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,948
May I arrange quarters
for you on the station?

48
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:57,534
No, I'll keep my flag
aboard the<i> Rotarran.</i>

49
00:01:57,576 --> 00:02:01,246
It may be cramped
but at least I'll feel
like I'm still in the war.

50
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:04,291
By the way, I'd like Worf
to continue functioning

51
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,167
as my principal
Intelligence Officer.

52
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,211
I don't see any problem
with that.

53
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:11,214
He's the only officer I know
who can never get enough work.

54
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,341
(<i> cackles</i> )

55
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,885
Well, at least if he's busy

56
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:18,263
he'll stop going on
about this wedding of his.

57
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,850
Oh, there were times
aboard the<i> Rotarran</i>

58
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:23,644
he nearly drove me mad.

59
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:26,855
Until his son arrived,
it was all he could talk about.

60
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:29,733
Then Alexander became
all he could talk about.

61
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:33,403
The man is nothing
if not single-minded.

62
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,238
I haven't met Worf's son yet.

63
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,240
What's he like?

64
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,951
He's a fine boy...

65
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:41,620
dedicated, eager.

66
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,456
He has the heart
of his father

67
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:47,918
but he's not the best
soldier I've ever seen.

68
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,545
But when he ordered me
to bring the system
back online,

69
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,880
I thought he was still talking

70
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:54,549
about the hydro-static
system, so...

71
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,759
You didn't
engage the pumps

72
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,427
while the check valves
were open.

73
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:58,762
He did.

74
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:00,681
I flooded
the entire deck

75
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,557
with super-heated
hydraulic fluid.

76
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,977
It took me three days
to clean it up

77
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:07,729
but, I swear, it still smells
like burnt dog hair in there.

78
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:11,025
Oh! Remind me to keep you away
from the<i> Defiant.</i>
You're a menace.

79
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:14,235
The<i> Rotarran's</i> crew
actually thinks of me
as a good luck charm.

80
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:19,533
You know, the more mistakes
<i>I</i> make, the safer<i> they</i> feel.

81
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:22,119
I hope the<i> Ya'Vang's crew</i>
feels the same way.

82
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:23,787
The<i> Ya'Vang?</i>

83
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,915
I got new orders this morning.

84
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:29,793
The battle cruiser<i> Ya'Vang</i>
took heavy losses

85
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:31,503
in their last engagement

86
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,922
so most of the<i> Rotarran's crew</i>
are being transferred there

87
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,675
at the end of the week,
including me.

88
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:41,180
Uh, more bloodwine?

89
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,389
Why not?

90
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,391
No. Not for me.

91
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,811
Handsome young man.

92
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:50,105
He must get his
looks from his
mother's side.

93
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,606
What do you want?

94
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:55,152
Have you had a chance
to reconsider my offer?

95
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:58,155
We are not getting
married in this bar.

96
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:00,782
The ceremony
will take place
on the Klingon homeworld

97
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,034
after the war.

98
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:05,204
Worf, let's do it here,
this week

99
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,538
before Alexander leaves.

100
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,831
QUARK:
Perfect.

101
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,124
I'll handle
all the arrangements.

102
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,919
Wait. I thought
we had agreed.

103
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,171
We did, but I would hate
for Alexander

104
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:15,422
to miss
his father's wedding.

105
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,092
It would mean so much to him.

106
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:22,012
And besides,
it may be a long time

107
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:24,098
before you see him again.

108
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,231
What's going on?

109
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,069
Our wedding plans
have changed.

110
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:40,280
We are getting
married here
on Deep Space 9

111
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:43,909
and I would like you
to be my<i> Tawi'Yan.</i>

112
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,872
"Sword-bearer."

113
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:51,499
It's sort of like
a best man.

114
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,668
Me?

115
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,003
Really?

116
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:55,879
Oh, that's great!

117
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:57,714
(<i> yelping</i> )

118
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:02,094
I'll put that
on your tab.

119
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,299
DAX:
It doesn't
leave much time

120
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,884
to make
all the arrangements

121
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,969
but fortunately, there isn't
that much left to do.

122
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,846
Worf's been planning
the ceremony

123
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,390
for the last three months.

124
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,267
He has everything
figured out

125
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,435
right down
to the color of my shoes.

126
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,397
No offense, Jadzia,
but it seems like this
wedding's

127
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,023
all about what Worf wants.

128
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,859
Uh, Habitat Ring,
Section 51 Gamma.

129
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,819
What about you?

130
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,322
A traditional Klingon wedding
with all the trimmings

131
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:30,450
is something Worf's
been thinking about
since he was a boy.

132
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:33,120
It probably has something
to do with being raised

133
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,704
by human parents.

134
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,915
In any case, when it comes
to Klingon tradition,

135
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,125
Worf is very sentimental.

136
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,667
Worf?

137
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,669
All men are sentimental.

138
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:45,299
They just cover it up with
scowls and clenched jaws.

139
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:50,011
There are times when Worf
literally gets misty-eyed

140
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,347
talking about
Klingon rituals.

141
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:55,392
So, uh, that's
why you're letting him

142
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:57,018
make the plans
for the wedding?

143
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,146
Mostly, but
the truth is

144
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,647
I've already
been through five

145
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:01,773
Trill ceremonies--

146
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,442
three as a bride,
two as a groom,

147
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,692
and I'm a little bored with it.

148
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,944
Is it my imagination

149
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,821
or did Odo just
try and avoid us?

150
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,239
I didn't notice.

151
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:10,991
(<i> sighs</i> )

152
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,617
We've been avoiding
each other

153
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,786
ever since the Dominion
left the station.

154
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,413
I think we're both
afraid of talking

155
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:18,415
about what happened
during the occupation.

156
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:20,917
What do you mean?

157
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,337
Oh, to tell you the truth,

158
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:26,423
it's nothing I want to talk
about right now either.

159
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,969
Thank you for coming.

160
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,929
As you probably know by now,

161
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:35,932
Jadzia and I will be married
here on the station
in six days.

162
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,517
There's nothing
more romantic

163
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,936
than a wedding on
DS9 in springtime.

164
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,688
When the neutrinos
are in bloom.

165
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,983
By tradition,
the Klingon man spends

166
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,360
the four nights
before his wedding

167
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,695
on a mental
and spiritual journey.

168
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:51,906
It is called<i> Kal'Hyah,</i>
"The Path of Clarity"

169
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:56,119
<i>and</i> he is accompanied
by his closest male friends.

170
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,663
You cannot imagine
the experience that awaits us--

171
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:03,251
four long nights filled
with song and fellowship.

172
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,628
A time of unbridled pleasures.

173
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,589
Are we talking
about a bachelor party here?

174
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,009
It is a similar ritual.

175
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,719
Sounds good to me.

176
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,221
Me, too.

177
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,889
Count me in.

178
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,391
We will meet
in the holosuite

179
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,100
tomorrow night
at 2100 hours.

180
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,395
MARTOK:
I advise you all
to get plenty of rest.

181
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,646
Four nights
at a Klingon bachelor party.

182
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,273
Just think of
the possibilities.

183
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,483
Thank God
Keiko's not here.

184
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:27,859
I wonder what Dax
will be doing

185
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,028
while we're traveling
down<i> Kal'Hyah.</i>

186
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,572
She will be taking
a different journey...

187
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,908
with my wife.

188
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,618
Your wife?

189
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,000
By marrying Worf,

190
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,169
Dax will be joining
the House of Martok.

191
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,004
Since the mistress
of a great House

192
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,630
must approve all marriages,

193
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,132
Sirella will spend
the next four days

194
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,967
evaluating Jadzia.

195
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,852
My lady.

196
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:05,730
You've put on weight...

197
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,149
and your hair is going gray.

198
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:14,030
My deterioration
is proceeding apace.

199
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:17,158
I thought you would be
in your grave by now.

200
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,326
(<i> chuckling</i> )

201
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,287
I shall endeavor to die--

202
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,080
this year, if possible.

203
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,999
Allow me to present
Captain Benjamin Sisko,

204
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,960
Commander of Deep Space 9.

205
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,962
Captain, may I present

206
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,881
the mistress of the House
of Martok, my wife

207
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,800
and the mother
of my children...

208
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:36,344
Sirella, daughter of Linkasa.

209
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:39,139
Welcome to
Deep Space 9.

210
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,308
Thank you, Captain.

211
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,725
Where is she?

212
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,395
Jadzia's quarters
are in the Habitat Ring,

213
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:48,231
Section... 25 Alpha.

214
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,483
Shall I escort you?

215
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,025
It's quite far away.

216
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,777
I'll find my way.

217
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,740
If you'll excuse me.

218
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:04,498
Magnificent, isn't she?

219
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:16,384
Are those real
<i>var'Hama</i> candles?

220
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,595
Yes, Worf,
I traveled to Kronos.

221
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:21,680
I captured three<i> targs</i>
in the Hamar mountains,

222
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,141
made the ritual
sacrifice at dawn,

223
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,226
came back
to the station,

224
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,437
asked Quark to boil their
shoulders into tallow.

225
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:30,940
Then, I spent two days
molding them into candles

226
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,066
with my own hands.

227
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,194
I was just asking.

228
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:37,864
You were
criticizing<i> again.</i>

229
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,534
Relax. She's not
going to reject

230
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:41,784
a prospective daughter

231
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,286
because the
<i>var'Hama</i> candles

232
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:44,787
in her welcoming
display were replicated.

233
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:45,913
(<i> door chimes</i> )

234
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,457
Come in.

235
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:55,882
<i>Tug son bosh mok</i>
<i>A'Beh, Sirella koH.</i>

236
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,384
<i>E'Gagh vet moh.</i>

237
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,719
What is<i> he</i> doing here?

238
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,763
I meant no disrespect.

239
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,015
Then leave.

240
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,236
Your worthiness to join
our House will now be judged

241
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,737
according to the traditions
of my family.

242
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,114
I am prepared, my lady.

243
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,949
I doubt that.

244
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:26,496
A Klingon woman would find it
difficult to gain my favor.

245
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:29,165
For...an<i> alien,</i>

246
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:31,543
it will most likely
be impossible.

247
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,086
I like a challenge.

248
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:37,716
I will not have my authority
challenged by you.

249
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:39,467
That's not what I meant.

250
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,845
If you cannot say
what you mean,
say nothing at all.

251
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,058
The evaluation
will begin tomorrow morning.

252
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,062
Have the traditional meal
prepared before I arrive.

253
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,524
And in the future,

254
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:58,403
if you cannot trouble yourself
to make real<i> var'Hama</i> candles,

255
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:02,156
try not to use
such obvious fakes.

256
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,550
You never told me
that your wife
was opposed to this marriage.

257
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:22,636
Sirella is a woman
of strong convictions.

258
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:24,512
She believes
that by bringing aliens

259
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:27,223
into our families,
we risk losing our identity

260
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:28,516
as Klingons.

261
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,393
That is a prejudiced,
xenophobic view.

262
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,395
We<i> are</i> Klingons, Worf.

263
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:36,357
We don't<i> embrace</i>
other cultures.
We<i> conquer</i> them.

264
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,778
If someone wishes to join us,
they must honor our traditions

265
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:41,446
and prove themselves worthy

266
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,990
of wearing the crest
of a Great House.

267
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,492
Jadzia<i> is</i> worthy.

268
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,327
Of course she is.

269
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:50,497
She's an honorable woman
and a formidable warrior.

270
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,249
You should say<i> that</i> to Sirella.

271
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,752
That's not such a good idea.

272
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,878
I don't want her to think

273
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,342
that I'm interfering
in her domain.

274
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,552
Perhaps I should
speak with her.

275
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,472
Coming from me, it would
not seem like a challenge

276
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:08,723
to her authority.

277
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,725
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

278
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:13,770
Why?

279
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,523
Well, um...

280
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,359
the truth is...

281
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,653
she doesn't like you
that much either.

282
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,488
Me.

283
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,532
Don't let that
bother you.

284
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,493
I had every right
to bring you into the family

285
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,244
and she's accepted the fact

286
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,039
that there's<i> nothing</i>
she can do about it.

287
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,499
How comforting.

288
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:36,751
(<i> chuckles</i> )

289
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:40,004
(<i> laughing</i> )

290
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:43,800
And they say that
you have no sense of humor.

291
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:47,303
(<i> laughing</i> )

292
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,528
Phew. I could do
without the heat.

293
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,113
I can't, uh, say much
for the decor either.

294
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,742
Well, it can't be
<i>all</i> fun and games.

295
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:12,078
I'm sure there has to be
some sort of ritual

296
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:15,081
we have to go through
before the party begins.

297
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:18,251
There<i> is</i> going to be
a party, isn't there?

298
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,753
You're asking me?

299
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:22,714
I can barely say
my name in Klingon.

300
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:25,759
MARTOK:
Prepare yourselves,
my friends

301
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,219
for a journey
you won't soon forget.

302
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,309
These...

303
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,853
are<i> Ma'Stakas.</i>

304
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:38,688
What, uh, what do
we do with them?

305
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,190
At the conclusion
of the wedding ceremony

306
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,693
you will use them
to attack Worf and Dax.

307
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,403
Obviously.
Don't you know anything?

308
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,696
The tradition dates back

309
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,740
to the wedding
of Kahless and Lukara

310
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,533
who were nearly killed
by Molor's troops

311
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:51,951
moments after they were
married.

312
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,661
Until the ceremony,

313
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,079
you should keep these with you
at all times.

314
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,706
SISKO:
I trust

315
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:59,292
this combat is non-lethal.

316
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,920
It is a symbolic
attack only.

317
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,254
Oh.

318
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,717
That food is not
to be eaten.

319
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,386
Then what is it for?

320
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:13,389
It is there to tempt us
to break our fast.

321
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:14,724
Fast?

322
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:16,016
There are six trials

323
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,603
we must face
on the path to<i> Kal'Hyah.</i>

324
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:21,021
This is the first--
deprivation.

325
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,274
We now begin a fast
that will continue

326
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,943
until the day of the wedding.

327
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,736
Well, th-that's
four days away.

328
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:28,362
MARTOK:
It is a short time,

329
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,114
I know, but we must
make the best of it.

330
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:33,326
What are
the other five trials?

331
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:36,996
Blood, pain, sacrifice,
anguish...

332
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,164
and death.

333
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,166
Sounds like marriage,
all right.

334
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,167
How would you know?

335
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,002
It is time to begin.

336
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,384
QUARK:
Need more flowers
on the banister.

337
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,011
MALE:
We're ready
with the banner, boss.

338
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,346
(<i> whistles</i> )

339
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,555
Raise it.

340
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,265
You're up early.

341
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:57,725
I thought writers
slept late.

342
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:58,893
Not always.

343
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,687
I sold my first
book today.

344
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:03,481
Really? How much
did you get for it?

345
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,149
It's just a
figure of speech.

346
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,776
The Federation
News Service

347
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:08,319
is going to publish
a book of my stories

348
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,737
about life on the station
under Dominion rule.

349
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,489
And they're not
paying you?

350
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,699
No.

351
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,492
Well, then you have
my sympathies

352
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,452
and the first round
of drinks is on the house.

353
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:17,578
Really?

354
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,790
No. It's a figure
of speech.

355
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:22,291
Look, I want to tell
my dad about the book.

356
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,002
Is he still in
the holosuite?

357
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,963
Oh, yeah.
They're still up there.

358
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,882
What are they doing?

359
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:31,509
It's a Klingon
bachelor party.

360
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:35,054
You're a writer.

361
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,181
Use your imagination.

362
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,895
BASHIR:
Alexander.

363
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,898
Grandma?

364
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:46,482
Guess again.

365
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,320
We're still on the...?

366
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:55,449
The road to<i> Kal'Hyah,</i>
day 500.

367
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,577
Maybe we should
turn down the heat

368
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,453
you know, for
Alexander's sake.

369
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,789
Oh, no, it's okay.
I, uh...

370
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,792
I just need some water.

371
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,712
Now, you don't want
to push yourself too hard.

372
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:11,549
You know, turning down the heat
might be a good idea.

373
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:14,552
The whole point
is to push yourself

374
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,513
to the limits
of your endurance.

375
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,100
(<i> panting</i> )

376
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,728
I will.

377
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:27,147
I want to travel
the entire path to<i> Kal'Hyah.</i>

378
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,400
Stoke the fire again!

379
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,318
As you wish.

380
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:37,241
Of course, we cannot expect
you non-Klingons to...

381
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,702
have the same stamina
as we do.

382
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:42,204
If you wish to quit,
no one will think

383
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,497
any less of you.

384
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,249
Who said anything
about quitting?

385
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,167
Not me.

386
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,378
I like the heat.

387
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,714
That's the spirit.

Again.

399
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,913
I've done it
three times already.

400
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:26,833
You continue
to rush through
the ceremony,

401
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,502
your body
position is poor,

402
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,504
and the placement
of the braziers

403
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:34,674
on their pedestals
is sloppy.

404
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:40,471
Do you know how heavy
those things are?

405
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,223
A Klingon woman
would not complain.

406
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,476
You wouldn't make
a Klingon woman

407
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:46,644
do it three times in a row.

408
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,146
I wouldn't have to.

409
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,439
She'd have done it correctly
the first time.

410
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:55,820
End this now, Jadzia.

411
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:58,197
Go back to your own people.

412
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,658
They will tolerate
your weaknesses

413
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,786
and your failings
in a way that
a Klingon family

414
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,412
never will.

415
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:09,167
In our House, you would
always be an alien--

416
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,293
an outsider.

417
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,879
At best, you'd be
an object of pity

418
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,297
but you'd never
be accepted

419
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,757
never an equal

420
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,553
because you can never
truly be one of us.

421
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:30,104
<i>Ko'ma tlang'goS ak-bay</i>

422
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:34,025
<i>Hava'dak croosh tovaH</i>

423
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,818
<i>Ko'ma Kahless</i>

424
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,362
<i>Ko'ma Kahless</i>

425
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:41,532
<i>Ko'ma Kahless.</i>

426
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:53,211
But the Second Dynasty ended
when General K'Trelan

427
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,254
assassinated Emperor Reclaw.

428
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:58,298
For the next ten years,
the Empire was ruled

429
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,551
by a Council elected
by the people.

430
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,762
Modern-day
Klingon historians

431
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,431
refer to this
as "The Dark Time."

432
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:09,852
But it's interesting to note
that this first and only

433
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:11,437
experiment
in Klingon democracy

434
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:14,190
actually produced
several reforms...

435
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:16,150
You are straying from the saga.

436
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,818
Am I?

437
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:22,740
Your task is to recite
the complete chronicle

438
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,825
of the women in my family.

439
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,410
I just thought I'd give you

440
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:29,288
a broader historical
perspective
along the way.

441
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:33,084
I am familiar
with Klingon history.

442
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:38,547
Now, return to the story
of my 23rd maternal grandmother

443
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:41,675
Shenara,
daughter of Emperor Reclaw

444
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,469
in the Second Dynasty.

445
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,931
Well, that's where we run
into a little bit of a problem.

446
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:49,016
You see, I did some research

447
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:51,351
and when Emperor Reclaw
was killed,

448
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:54,021
all of the members
of the Imperial Family

449
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:56,607
were put to death,
including Shenara.

450
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:59,860
When the Third Dynasty
was founded ten years later,

451
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:02,488
a new group of Klingons
were given the titles

452
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:06,450
and the names of the original
Imperial Family...

453
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:09,411
to create the<i> illusion</i>
of an unbroken line.

454
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,998
So, the woman
that you think of

455
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,834
as your 23rd
maternal grandmother...

456
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,003
isn't related to you at all.

457
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:20,589
Your real ancestor's name
was Karana,

458
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:24,135
a concubine living outside
the Imperial Stables.

459
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:27,596
My grandmother's name
was Shenara.

460
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:29,723
That may be
what's been passed down

461
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:33,936
from generation to generation,
but it has no basis in fact.

462
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:35,855
But who cares about facts?

463
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:39,399
The chronicle says
that you have
Imperial blood in your veins,

464
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:42,402
and that's exactly what
we'll keep telling everyone.

465
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:49,160
Continue with the saga.

466
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:51,453
My pleasure.

467
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,124
Hey, Major.

468
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,917
Is it true Dax is having
a party tomorrow night?

469
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,336
Ah, news travels fast.

470
00:22:58,376 --> 00:22:59,712
Well, is it by
invitation or...?

471
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,172
I'm sure you're welcome.

472
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:02,798
And you can tell Nog
the same goes for him, too.

473
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,383
Great.
Oh, I understand
congratulations are in order

474
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,345
to our newest
published author.

475
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:08,637
Thank you.

476
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:14,560
What was all that about?

477
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:15,519
Nothing.

478
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,395
There they go.

479
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,566
KIRA:
They look so serious.

480
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,068
It's all an act.

481
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,652
They don't want
the rest of us to know

482
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:26,239
what kind of debauchery
they're up to.
Like what?

483
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:31,118
It's a Klingon
bachelor party.

484
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,162
Use your imagination.

485
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,502
WORF:
Now begins
the Trial of Blood.

MARTOK:
Let rivers flow from our veins.

487
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:45,174
Who will be first?

488
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,894
I did not expect it
to be you, Doctor.

489
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:00,731
Neither did I.

490
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,024
Do not worry.

491
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:04,902
The pain will last
for only a moment.

492
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,078
Ta-hoo!

493
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,373
(<i> loud, rapid drumming</i> )

494
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,431
Isn't that grand?

495
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:35,808
Yeah! Whoo!

496
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,395
(<i> applause and cheering</i> )

497
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:40,938
All right!
He's unbelievable.

498
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,522
He's something.

499
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:48,362
Lieutenant Manuele Atoa

500
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:50,323
from the Starship
<i>Sutherland.</i>

501
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:52,116
I've never seen
anything like that.

502
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:54,327
Neither have I.

503
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:58,789
Let's get something to eat.

504
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:02,960
A woman of many talents.

505
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:05,045
It's a shame
she's about to waste them all

506
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:08,674
on that walking frown
she calls a fiancé.

507
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,092
She's too good for him.

508
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:11,302
I've said that
from the beginning.

509
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:13,053
Are you jealous?

510
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,307
There's no profit
in jealousy.

511
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:18,642
That's not a denial.

512
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:23,230
It's not to be
quoted either.

513
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:24,315
Oh, don't worry.

514
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:25,774
So when did
you first realize

515
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:27,443
you had these
feelings for Dax?

516
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,778
Quark, wait.

517
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:38,371
Miles?

518
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:39,997
Yeah?

519
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:43,209
It's working.

520
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,002
I've had a vision...

521
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,837
about the future.

522
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:49,715
I can see it so clearly.

523
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,801
What is it?

524
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:57,764
I'm going to kill Worf.

525
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,227
I'm going to kill Worf.

526
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,729
That's what I'm going to do.

527
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,731
I can see it clearly now.

528
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,607
I'm going to kill him.

529
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,151
Kill Worf.

530
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:10,486
Kill Worf.

531
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:11,529
Kill Worf.

532
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:12,738
Kill Worf.

533
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:13,739
(<i> coughs</i> )

534
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,324
Kill Worf.

535
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:18,077
(<i> loud drumming and</i>
<i>conversations continue</i> )

536
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:37,012
I've been getting complaints
about the noise.

537
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:39,265
Someone even
mentioned a fight?

538
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,183
Oh, there was a scuffle

539
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:43,685
between Morn
and one of the Bolians

540
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,438
but they
worked it out.

541
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:47,523
How long will this...

542
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:49,442
party continue?

543
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:53,153
This party will continue
until further notice

544
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:55,739
on the personal
authority

545
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,241
of this station's
First Officer

546
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:58,451
who just happens
to be me.

547
00:26:58,492 --> 00:26:59,826
Mm-hmm.

548
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,495
You're in a good mood.

549
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:04,123
Well, it's
a good party.

550
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,375
Well...

551
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:07,793
Odo...

552
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:10,796
Odo...

553
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:13,757
I think we have
a lot to talk about.

554
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:15,801
I agree.

555
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,595
So let's talk.

556
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:19,346
Now?

557
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:21,807
Don't you think we've
put it off long enough?

558
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:25,894
Enjoy yourselves.

559
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,356
Let's, um...

560
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,400
find someplace
a little quieter.

561
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,906
(<i> yells</i> )

562
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,620
Thanks for the show.

563
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,289
Thanks for getting me
the day off.

564
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:46,748
Captain Shelby
owed me a favor.

565
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,208
Actually,
owed me several.

566
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,877
In fact, how would
you like to have

567
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,546
another two days off?

568
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,214
Two?

569
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:55,508
What do I have to do?

570
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:56,842
Not much.

571
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,718
Just give me something
fun to look at

572
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,429
for the rest
of the evening.

573
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:01,347
Anything else?

574
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,641
I'll let you know.

575
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:05,309
SIRELLA:
You!

576
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:09,146
Leave her
or I'll cut your head off

577
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:10,688
and hang it from my belt.

578
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,316
I'll take care of this.

579
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:14,734
(<i> drumming and conversations</i>
<i>stop</i> )

580
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,028
You weren't invited.

581
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:18,989
It is time
for the<i> Bre'Nan</i> ritual.

582
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,616
I'm busy.

583
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:24,411
Busy acting
like a Risian slut.

584
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:28,040
I'm only going to ask
you to leave once.

585
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,209
You will come
with me now and perform

586
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,586
the<i> Bre'Nan</i> ritual
to my satisfaction

587
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:34,796
or I will cancel your wedding.

588
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,382
<i>Toruk-DOH!</i>

589
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,135
NOG:
Ladies, please.

590
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:42,054
SIRELLA:

00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,972
<i>kash a'VEH!</i>

592
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:52,814
Why is everyone
standing around?

593
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:55,108
The party's
just getting started.

594
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,652
Play something!

595
00:28:56,694 --> 00:28:58,862
(<i> drumming resumes</i> )

596
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:17,381
Double<i> raktajino,</i> extra sweet.

597
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,594
(<i> groans</i> )

598
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:23,679
What time is it?

599
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:25,389
1030 hours.

600
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:28,016
Come on.

601
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:33,606
Wrong door.

602
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:41,947
Excuse me, sir.

603
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,790
Jadzia

604
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:54,000
we need to...

605
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:58,631
You're mad.

606
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:01,467
I am concerned.

607
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,552
Yeah, well, I'm hung over.

608
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:05,137
Can we talk later?

609
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,681
We have a very
serious problem.

610
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:10,225
Sirella has canceled
the wedding.

611
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:13,186
She doesn't waste
any time, does she?

612
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,439
She said
you attacked her.

613
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:18,776
She pulled a knife.

614
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,865
You are forbidden to join
the House of Martok.

615
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,661
So I won't be invited
to the family picnics.

616
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:30,496
I'll live.

617
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:33,415
I cannot believe
how you're taking
this so lightly.

618
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:34,667
Do you hear that?

619
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,084
What?

620
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:37,628
(<i> muffled voices</i> )

621
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,630
It sounds like voices.

622
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,679
Hi.
Hi.

623
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,930
ODO:
Is the party over?

624
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:52,392
You could say that.
It's 10:30.

625
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:55,103
In the morning?
I'm on duty.

626
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:56,730
So am I.

627
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:57,856
It was a great party.

628
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:59,274
Thanks.

629
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:08,158
We must deal
with the situation now.

630
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,745
Stop yelling.
My head hurts.

631
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:15,123
You must go to Sirella
and beg her forgiveness.

632
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:24,007
I don't beg.

633
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:27,720
You are allowing
your pride to blind you.

634
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:29,179
Look who's talking.

635
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,139
You want me to go crawling
to some old hag

636
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:33,308
just so you can have your
traditional Klingon wedding.

637
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:36,144
This is about more
than just tradition.

638
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:41,734
You and I have embarked
on a spiritual journey,

639
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:43,276
one that will
bind us together

640
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,487
through this life
and into the next.

641
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:47,113
You cannot turn back now.

642
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,742
Maybe you're on
a spiritual journey, Worf,

643
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:51,869
but I just want
to get married.

644
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,497
So why don't you go back
to sweating and bleeding

645
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:57,416
with your friends
in the holosuite,

646
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:58,792
and when you're done,

647
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,586
meet me in
Benjamin's office

648
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:02,546
and he'll perform
the ceremony.

649
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,890
If that is your attitude...

650
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,436
perhaps Sirella
was right about you.

651
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:23,066
There should be no wedding.

652
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,111
That's fine with me.

653
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:31,241
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

654
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:49,802
(<i> whistling</i> )

655
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:51,219
What's going on?

656
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:52,304
Haven't you heard?

657
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,430
The wedding's off.

658
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:55,181
Off? Why?

659
00:32:55,223 --> 00:33:00,061
She says it's because
he's a pig-headed, stubborn man

660
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,606
who puts tradition
before everything else.

661
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:05,150
He says it's because
she's a frivolous

662
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,693
emotional woman

663
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:09,154
who refuses to take him
or his culture seriously.

664
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,490
You can see
the problem.

665
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,116
They're both right.

666
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:14,409
Exactly.

667
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:17,871
Well... there's only
one thing for it.

668
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,166
Dinner.

669
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,418
I'll get the menu.

670
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,011
(<i> door chimes</i> )

671
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:34,513
Enter.

672
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,730
Worf...

673
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:46,024
you've made a grave error.

674
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:50,904
Perhaps.

675
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:53,239
Do you still love her?

676
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,283
Of course.

677
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:58,411
However, in this
case,<i> that...</i>

678
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,580
may not be enough.

679
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:05,544
Anyone can see that we are
hopelessly mismatched.

680
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,796
She is a Trill;
I am a Klingon.

681
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:10,632
She has had
five marriages.

682
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:12,843
This would be my first.

683
00:34:12,885 --> 00:34:15,929
When she is laughing,
I am somber.

684
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:17,723
When I am happy,
she is crying.

685
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:21,059
She plays<i> tongo</i> with
the Ferengi bartender.

686
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,395
I can barely stand him.

687
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:28,400
She mocks everything...

688
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:31,152
while I take
everything seriously.

689
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,491
She is nothing
like the woman
I thought I would marry.

690
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:41,204
We are not accorded
the luxury

691
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:44,750
of choosing the women
we fall in love with.

692
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:47,711
Do you think Sirella
is anything like the woman

693
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:49,880
I thought that I'd marry?

694
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:56,302
She is a prideful,
arrogant, mercurial woman

695
00:34:56,344 --> 00:35:01,224
who shares my bed far too
infrequently for my taste.

696
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:04,394
And yet...

697
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:08,314
I love her...

698
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,400
deeply.

699
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,360
Hmm.

700
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:16,823
We Klingons often tout our...

701
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18,951
prowess in battle...

702
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:24,289
our desire for glory and honor
above all else...

703
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:27,751
but how hollow is
the sound of victory...

704
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:30,879
without someone
to share it with?

705
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:34,091
Honor gives
little comfort

706
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,259
to a man alone
in his home...

707
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:39,054
and in his heart.

708
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:46,352
One steak with mushrooms

709
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,187
baked potato, sour cream
and chives.

710
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:49,606
I should have had that.

711
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:53,026
One double Altair sandwich,
no mustard...

712
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:54,820
two bowls of linguini,

713
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:57,948
Bajoran shrimp
with extra cheese.

714
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:00,408
One loaf of mapa bread.

715
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,368
Quark, where's
the<i> kava</i> juice?

716
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,662
They're still
squeezing the roots

717
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,204
unless you want replicated.

718
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,581
We'll wait.

719
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:08,583
SISKO:
What do you think
you're doing?

720
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:10,794
The wedding's
been called off.

721
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:11,920
It's back on.

722
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:14,589
Worf is apologizing
to Jadzia

723
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:15,924
at this very moment.

724
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:17,509
Quark, take
it all away.

725
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,261
No food for those
on the path to<i> Kal'Hyah.</i>

726
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:23,473
No refunds for those
on the path
to<i> Kal'Hyah</i> as well.

727
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:24,766
Sorry.

728
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:32,024
Father, what happened?

729
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,277
She refused
to change her mind

730
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,363
and the wedding is still off.

731
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:39,656
(<i> sighs</i> )

732
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:40,824
Where is she?

733
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:42,826
In her quarters.

734
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:44,953
I'll go talk to her.

735
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:48,456
Just... keep them away
from the food?

736
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,589
(<i> door chimes</i> )

737
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:57,966
Come in!

738
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:00,969
Save your breath.

739
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:03,262
Worf's gone too far,
and now it's over.

740
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,306
Do you know what
he wanted me to do?

741
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:08,768
He wanted me to go crawling
on my hands and knees
to Sirella

742
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,353
to beg her forgiveness.

743
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:11,813
Beg her! Me!

744
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:13,523
I was once

745
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:16,860
the Federation Ambassador
to the Klingon Empire.

746
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,780
I negotiated
the Khitomer Accords

747
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:22,407
before Worf
was even born.

748
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:24,450
Curzonnegotiated the Accords!

749
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:25,994
And I've got news for you,
old man.

750
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:27,662
You're not Curzon anymore.

751
00:37:27,704 --> 00:37:30,082
And what the hell is that
supposed to mean?

752
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:32,042
It means that you
can't expect Sirella

753
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:33,292
to treat you like Curzon

754
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,670
just because you carry
his memories.

755
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:37,172
To her, you're just
a young woman

756
00:37:37,214 --> 00:37:39,465
who decided to marry
into her family.

757
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,051
If it means
you have to bow down

758
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:42,677
and kiss her boots,

759
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:45,972
that's exactly what you have
to do, and you knew that.

760
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:48,349
The moment you decided
to marry Worf,

761
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,643
you knew that sooner or later
you'd have to bow down

762
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,354
and show her the respect
that she's due.

763
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,023
This is Worf's fault--

764
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:57,650
Worf and his traditional
Klingon wedding.

765
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,945
Well, he may have let
this wedding business

766
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:04,116
go to his head,
but you are 356 years old.

767
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:07,077
Compared to you,
Worf is just a kid.

768
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,205
And if you can't abide
by Klingon traditions,

769
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:11,748
then you never should
have let yourself

770
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:14,500
fall in love with him
in the first place.

771
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:19,714
And you<i> are</i>
in love with him.

772
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:24,136
I wasn't looking
to fall in love.

773
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:27,346
I was perfectly happy
by myself.

774
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:30,850
I had friends, a career,
adventure...

775
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:36,773
Then one day...

776
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:39,609
this Klingon
with a bad attitude

777
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,153
walked into my life

778
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:45,490
and the next thing I know,
I'm getting married.

779
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:49,661
After 356 years
and seven lifetimes...

780
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:53,581
I still lead with my heart.

781
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:57,376
You know, that is
what I've always
loved about you.

782
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:03,049
And I think that's why
Worf loves you, too.

783
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:11,933
(<i> sighs</i> )

784
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:18,606
Whatever happened to that
young, callow Ensign
I used to know?

785
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:21,193
The one who used
to turn to me

786
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:23,361
for advice all the time?

787
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:27,365
You know,
the one with hair?

788
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,492
I grew up.

789
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:36,624
I guess it's time
I grow up, too.

790
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,751
Mmm.

791
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:21,586
With fire and steel

792
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:25,215
did the gods forge
the Klingon heart.

793
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:27,008
So fiercely did it beat,

794
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:30,887
so loud was the sound,
that the gods cried out,

795
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:33,973
"On this day
we have brought forth

796
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:37,685
"the strongest heart
in all the heavens.

797
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:41,189
"None can stand before it
without trembling

798
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:42,648
at its strength."

799
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:46,152
But then the Klingon heart
weakened

800
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:48,821
its steady rhythm faltered
and the gods said,

801
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,116
"Why have you weakened so?

802
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:52,658
"We have made you the strongest

803
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,661
in all of creation."

804
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,580
And the heart said...

805
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:58,915
I am alone.

806
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:03,044
And the gods knew
that they had erred.

807
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:04,879
So they went back
to their forge

808
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:08,216
and brought forth...
another heart.

809
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:41,707
But the second heart
beat stronger than the first,

810
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:44,043
and the first was jealous
of its power.

811
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,633
Fortunately...

812
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:52,218
the second heart
was tempered

813
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,678
by wisdom.

814
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:57,765
If we join together,
no force can stop us.

815
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:08,318
And when the two hearts
began to beat together,

816
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,322
they filled the heavens
with a terrible sound.

817
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:16,368
For the first time,
the gods knew fear.

818
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:19,371
They tried to flee,
but it was too late.

819
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:22,665
The Klingon hearts
destroyed the gods

820
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:23,875
who created them

821
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:27,253
and turned the heavens
to ashes.

822
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:28,963
To this very day

823
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:34,093
no one can oppose the beating
of two Klingon hearts.

824
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:38,139
Not even me.

825
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:46,523
Worf, son of Mogh,
does your heart beat

826
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,774
only for this woman?

827
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,860
Yes.

828
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:53,821
And will you swear
to join with her

829
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:57,242
and stand with her
against all
who oppose you?

830
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:59,869
I swear.

831
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:02,497
Jadzia, daughter of Kela,

832
00:43:02,539 --> 00:43:06,459
does your heart beat
only for this man?

833
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,503
Yes.

834
00:43:08,545 --> 00:43:10,755
And do you swear
to join with him

835
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:12,048
and stand with him

836
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,883
against all
who would oppose you?

837
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,011
(<i> whispering</i> ):
I swear.

838
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:20,639
Then let all present
here today know

839
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:25,437
that this man
and this woman are married.

840
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:27,980
(<i> applause</i> )

841
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:34,779
Now?

842
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,531
Not yet.

843
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:44,872
Now?

844
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:46,999
Patience.

845
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,628
My Lady.

846
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:54,424
Welcome to the House
of Martok...

847
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:57,718
my daughter.

848
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:03,600
Now, Doctor!

849
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,561
(<i> yelling</i> )
