1
00:00:02,999 --> 00:00:06,268
Captain's Personal Log,
Stardate 51247.5.

2
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:09,677
It's been a week since
our return to Deep Space 9

3
00:00:09,713 --> 00:00:12,150
but the mood
of celebration continues.

4
00:00:12,185 --> 00:00:14,155
We're still at war,
and the station's

5
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:16,490
been designated headquarters
for the Ninth Fleet.

6
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:18,589
That, plus
our strategic position

7
00:00:18,632 --> 00:00:20,728
guarding the wormhole,
makes DS9

8
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:22,468
one of the most
tempting targets

9
00:00:22,508 --> 00:00:24,034
in the entire quadrant.

10
00:00:24,078 --> 00:00:28,315
But for now, at least,
the war seems very far away.

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,727
- Morning.
- Good morning.

12
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,399
Good morning.

13
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:38,910
Morning, Major.

14
00:00:38,944 --> 00:00:40,641
Good morning, Captain.

15
00:00:40,681 --> 00:00:43,677
Do you know how much I missed
hearing you say that?

16
00:00:43,721 --> 00:00:45,748
Do you know how much
I hated saying

17
00:00:45,792 --> 00:00:47,056
"Good morning, Dukat"?

18
00:00:47,095 --> 00:00:48,063
I can imagine.

19
00:00:48,098 --> 00:00:49,431
What's on the agenda?

20
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:52,098
USS <i>Potemkin</i>
has completed her repairs

21
00:00:52,139 --> 00:00:54,406
and is rejoining the fleet
later today.

22
00:00:54,444 --> 00:00:56,175
<i>Exeter, Sutherland</i> and <i>Agaki</i>

23
00:00:56,215 --> 00:00:58,117
have submitted
resupply requests

24
00:00:58,153 --> 00:01:00,454
and there are
about 1,000 messages

25
00:01:00,492 --> 00:01:01,756
from Starfleet Command

26
00:01:01,794 --> 00:01:03,855
awaiting your "eyes-only"
attention.

27
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,026
Anything else?

28
00:01:05,068 --> 00:01:07,403
General Martok is waiting
in your office.

29
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,239
Oh, I'll start with the General.

30
00:01:09,344 --> 00:01:10,779
I thought you would.

31
00:01:12,551 --> 00:01:16,583
Have I mentioned
that it's good to be home?

32
00:01:16,627 --> 00:01:18,324
Once or twice.

33
00:01:20,334 --> 00:01:22,133
All right.

34
00:01:26,181 --> 00:01:28,014
You knew about this, didn't you?

35
00:01:28,052 --> 00:01:30,182
Oh, I had a pretty good idea.

36
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:33,219
And you did nothing to stop it.

37
00:01:33,263 --> 00:01:34,857
No.

38
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,303
In fact, I recommended you
for the position myself.

39
00:01:37,406 --> 00:01:40,071
Allow me to offer
my congratulations

40
00:01:40,111 --> 00:01:43,676
to the new Supreme Commander
of the Ninth Fleet.

41
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:46,623
Do you have any idea
how much paperwork

42
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:49,290
a Supreme Commander has to do?

43
00:01:49,332 --> 00:01:50,425
You're welcome.

44
00:01:52,137 --> 00:01:54,574
May I arrange quarters
for you on the station?

45
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,979
No, I'll keep my flag
aboard the <i>Rotarran.</i>

46
00:01:57,015 --> 00:01:58,484
It may be cramped

47
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:01,583
but at least I'll feel
like I'm still in the war.

48
00:02:01,626 --> 00:02:04,427
By the way, I'd like Worf
to continue functioning

49
00:02:04,465 --> 00:02:06,595
as my principal
Intelligence Officer.

50
00:02:06,637 --> 00:02:08,470
I don't see any problem
with that.

51
00:02:08,507 --> 00:02:11,810
He's the only officer I know
who can never get enough work.

52
00:02:13,451 --> 00:02:15,752
Well, at least if he's busy

53
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:19,629
he'll stop going on
about this wedding of his.

54
00:02:19,665 --> 00:02:21,829
Oh, there were times
aboard the <i>Rotarran</i>

55
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,737
he nearly drove me mad.

56
00:02:23,774 --> 00:02:27,077
Until his son arrived,
it was all he could talk about.

57
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:30,053
Then Alexander became
all he could talk about.

58
00:02:30,088 --> 00:02:33,687
The man is nothing
if not single-minded.

59
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:35,562
I haven't met Worf's son yet.

60
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,593
What's he like?

61
00:02:37,638 --> 00:02:39,369
He's a fine boy...

62
00:02:39,408 --> 00:02:41,902
dedicated, eager.

63
00:02:41,947 --> 00:02:44,851
He has the heart of his father

64
00:02:44,887 --> 00:02:48,622
but he's not the best
soldier I've ever seen.

65
00:02:48,662 --> 00:02:51,327
But when he ordered me
to bring the system back on line

66
00:02:51,368 --> 00:02:52,860
I thought he was still talking

67
00:02:52,904 --> 00:02:54,874
about the hydro-static
system, so...

68
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:56,242
You didn't engage the pumps

69
00:02:56,278 --> 00:02:57,975
while the check valves
were open.

70
00:02:58,016 --> 00:02:59,075
He did.

71
00:02:59,119 --> 00:03:01,055
I flooded the entire deck

72
00:03:01,089 --> 00:03:03,219
with super-heated
hydraulic fluid.

73
00:03:03,261 --> 00:03:05,163
It took me three days
to clean it up

74
00:03:05,198 --> 00:03:08,365
but, I swear, it still smells
like burnt dog hair in there.

75
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:10,842
Remind me to keep you away
from the <i>Defiant.</i>

76
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:11,846
You're a menace.

77
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,041
The <i>Rotarran's</i> crew

78
00:03:13,082 --> 00:03:15,553
actually thinks of me
as a good luck charm.

79
00:03:15,587 --> 00:03:19,892
You know, the more mistakes
I make, the safer they feel.

80
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:22,732
I hope the <i>Ya'Vang's</i> crew
feels the same way.

81
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,205
The <i>Ya'Vang?</i>

82
00:03:25,242 --> 00:03:27,041
I got new orders this morning.

83
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,847
The battle cruiser <i>Ya'Vang</i>
took heavy losses

84
00:03:29,886 --> 00:03:31,378
in their last engagement

85
00:03:31,422 --> 00:03:34,884
so most of the <i>Rotarran's</i> crew
are being transferred there

86
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:37,129
at the end of the week,
including me.

87
00:03:39,273 --> 00:03:41,767
Uh, more bloodwine?

88
00:03:41,812 --> 00:03:42,939
Why not?

89
00:03:42,981 --> 00:03:44,883
No. Not for me.

90
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,219
Handsome young man.

91
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,788
He must get his looks
from his mother's side.

92
00:03:50,832 --> 00:03:52,324
What do you want?

93
00:03:52,369 --> 00:03:55,809
Have you had a chance
to reconsider my offer?

94
00:03:55,843 --> 00:03:58,076
We are not getting
married in this bar.

95
00:03:58,114 --> 00:04:01,281
The ceremony will take place
on the Klingon homeworld

96
00:04:01,321 --> 00:04:03,223
after the war.

97
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,788
Worf, let's do it here,
this week

98
00:04:05,832 --> 00:04:07,267
before Alexander leaves.

99
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:08,394
Perfect.

100
00:04:08,437 --> 00:04:09,838
I'll handle
all the arrangements.

101
00:04:09,873 --> 00:04:12,572
Wait. I thought
we had agreed.

102
00:04:12,613 --> 00:04:14,549
We did, but I would hate
for Alexander

103
00:04:14,584 --> 00:04:16,053
to miss his father's wedding.

104
00:04:16,087 --> 00:04:19,390
It would mean so much to him

105
00:04:19,428 --> 00:04:22,401
and besides,
it may be a long time

106
00:04:22,435 --> 00:04:25,408
before you see him again.

107
00:04:30,452 --> 00:04:32,753
What's going on?

108
00:04:35,764 --> 00:04:37,757
Our wedding plans have changed.

109
00:04:37,802 --> 00:04:41,105
We are getting married here
on Deep Space 9

110
00:04:41,142 --> 00:04:45,413
and I would like you
to be my <i>Tawi'Yan.</i>

111
00:04:47,624 --> 00:04:49,150
"Sword-bearer."

112
00:04:49,194 --> 00:04:52,167
It's sort of like a best man.

113
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,170
Me?

114
00:04:54,205 --> 00:04:55,538
Really?

115
00:04:55,641 --> 00:04:56,631
Oh, that's great!

116
00:05:00,652 --> 00:05:03,180
I'll put that on your tab.

117
00:07:02,648 --> 00:07:05,211
It doesn't leave much time
to make all the arrangements

118
00:07:05,254 --> 00:07:07,555
but fortunately, there isn't
that much left to do.

119
00:07:07,591 --> 00:07:09,652
Worf's been planning
the ceremony

120
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:11,165
for the last three months.

121
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,863
He has everything figured out

122
00:07:12,903 --> 00:07:15,067
right down to the color
of my shoes.

123
00:07:15,109 --> 00:07:18,082
No offense, Jadzia,
but it seems like this wedding's

124
00:07:18,115 --> 00:07:19,584
all about what Worf wants.

125
00:07:19,652 --> 00:07:22,419
Uh, Habitat Ring,
Section 51 Gamma.

126
00:07:22,457 --> 00:07:23,550
What about you?

127
00:07:24,963 --> 00:07:27,127
A traditional Klingon wedding
with all the trimmings

128
00:07:27,168 --> 00:07:28,797
is something Worf's
been thinking about

129
00:07:28,838 --> 00:07:30,137
since he was a boy.

130
00:07:30,175 --> 00:07:32,738
It probably has something
to do with being raised

131
00:07:32,781 --> 00:07:34,273
by human parents.

132
00:07:34,318 --> 00:07:36,551
In any case, when it comes
to Klingon tradition

133
00:07:36,588 --> 00:07:37,749
Worf is very sentimental.

134
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:39,261
Worf?

135
00:07:39,294 --> 00:07:41,424
All men are sentimental.

136
00:07:41,466 --> 00:07:44,928
They just cover it up with
scowls and clenched jaws.

137
00:07:44,973 --> 00:07:49,848
There are times when Worf
literally gets misty-eyed

138
00:07:49,884 --> 00:07:51,820
talking about Klingon rituals.

139
00:07:53,192 --> 00:07:55,162
So, uh, that's
why you're letting him

140
00:07:55,197 --> 00:07:56,860
make the plans for the wedding?

141
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,836
Mostly, but the truth is

142
00:07:58,871 --> 00:08:01,206
I've already been through
five Trill ceremonies...

143
00:08:01,243 --> 00:08:03,110
three as a bride,
two as a groom,

144
00:08:03,147 --> 00:08:04,308
and I'm a little bored with it.

145
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,511
Is it my imagination

146
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:07,522
or did Odo just
try and avoid us?

147
00:08:07,556 --> 00:08:08,649
I didn't notice.

148
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,299
We've been avoiding each other

149
00:08:12,334 --> 00:08:14,430
ever since the Dominion
left the station.

150
00:08:14,472 --> 00:08:16,135
I think we're both
afraid of talking

151
00:08:16,176 --> 00:08:18,146
about what happened
during the occupation.

152
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,515
What do you mean?

153
00:08:20,552 --> 00:08:22,887
Oh, to tell you the truth

154
00:08:22,924 --> 00:08:26,295
it's nothing I want to talk
about right now either.

155
00:08:29,271 --> 00:08:30,638
Thank you for coming.

156
00:08:30,674 --> 00:08:32,200
As you probably know by now

157
00:08:32,244 --> 00:08:35,403
Jadzia and I will be married
here on the station in six days.

158
00:08:35,536 --> 00:08:36,971
There's nothing more romantic

159
00:08:37,006 --> 00:08:39,239
than a wedding
on DS9 in springtime.

160
00:08:39,277 --> 00:08:41,110
When the neutrinos are in bloom.

161
00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:43,620
By tradition,
the Klingon man spends

162
00:08:43,654 --> 00:08:45,647
the four nights
before his wedding

163
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,925
on a mental
and spiritual journey.

164
00:08:47,964 --> 00:08:51,369
It is called <i>Kal'Hyah,</i>
"The Path of Clarity"

165
00:08:51,404 --> 00:08:55,470
and he is accompanied
by his closest male friends.

166
00:08:55,514 --> 00:08:58,042
You cannot imagine
the experience that awaits us...

167
00:08:58,086 --> 00:09:02,619
four long nights filled
with song and fellowship.

168
00:09:02,662 --> 00:09:04,997
A time of unbridled pleasures.

169
00:09:05,034 --> 00:09:08,633
Are we talking
about a bachelor party here?

170
00:09:08,676 --> 00:09:10,339
It is a similar ritual.

171
00:09:10,446 --> 00:09:11,539
Sounds good to me.

172
00:09:11,582 --> 00:09:12,572
Me, too.

173
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:15,318
Count me in.

174
00:09:15,357 --> 00:09:18,592
We will meet in the holosuite
tomorrow night at 2100 hours.

175
00:09:18,631 --> 00:09:20,795
I advise you all
to get plenty of rest.

176
00:09:20,835 --> 00:09:23,068
Four nights
at a Klingon bachelor party.

177
00:09:23,107 --> 00:09:24,974
Just think of the possibilities.

178
00:09:25,011 --> 00:09:26,537
Thank God Keiko's not here.

179
00:09:26,582 --> 00:09:28,313
I wonder what Dax will be doing

180
00:09:28,352 --> 00:09:30,345
while we're traveling
down <i>Kal'Hyah.</i>

181
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,725
She will be taking
a different journey...

182
00:09:32,761 --> 00:09:35,665
with my wife.

183
00:09:35,702 --> 00:09:38,037
Your wife?

184
00:09:42,116 --> 00:09:43,243
By marrying Worf

185
00:09:43,285 --> 00:09:45,415
Dax will be joining
the House of Martok.

186
00:09:45,457 --> 00:09:47,427
Since the mistress
of a great House

187
00:09:47,494 --> 00:09:48,986
must approve all marriages

188
00:09:49,031 --> 00:09:51,058
Sirella will spend
the next four days

189
00:09:51,102 --> 00:09:52,401
evaluating Jadzia.

190
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,289
My lady.

191
00:10:02,327 --> 00:10:05,026
You've put on weight...

192
00:10:05,066 --> 00:10:07,435
and your hair is going gray.

193
00:10:08,473 --> 00:10:13,576
My deterioration
is proceeding apace.

194
00:10:13,618 --> 00:10:16,648
I thought you would be
in your grave by now.

195
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,458
I shall endeavor to die...

196
00:10:19,498 --> 00:10:21,331
this year, if possible.

197
00:10:21,369 --> 00:10:24,205
Allow me to present
Captain Benjamin Sisko

198
00:10:24,241 --> 00:10:26,177
Commander of Deep Space 9.

199
00:10:26,213 --> 00:10:28,446
Captain, may I present

200
00:10:28,484 --> 00:10:31,354
the mistress of the House
of Martok, my wife

201
00:10:31,391 --> 00:10:33,293
and the mother of my children...

202
00:10:33,328 --> 00:10:35,799
Sirella, daughter of Linkasa.

203
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:37,531
Welcome to Deep Space 9.

204
00:10:38,573 --> 00:10:40,669
Thank you, Captain.

205
00:10:40,711 --> 00:10:42,203
Where is she?

206
00:10:42,248 --> 00:10:44,719
Jadzia's quarters are
in the Habitat Ring

207
00:10:44,754 --> 00:10:47,385
Section... 25 Alpha.

208
00:10:47,426 --> 00:10:48,793
Shall I escort you?

209
00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:50,560
It's quite far away.

210
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,035
I'll find my way.

211
00:10:55,544 --> 00:10:57,879
If you'll excuse me.

212
00:11:00,053 --> 00:11:03,686
Magnificent, isn't she?

213
00:11:12,614 --> 00:11:15,518
Are those real <i>var'Hama</i> candles?

214
00:11:15,555 --> 00:11:17,719
Yes, Worf, I traveled to Kronos.

215
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:20,755
I captured three <i>targs</i>
in the Hamar mountains

216
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:22,769
made the ritual sacrifice
at dawn

217
00:11:22,803 --> 00:11:24,397
came back to the station

218
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,777
asked Quark to boil
their shoulders into tallow.

219
00:11:27,814 --> 00:11:30,513
Then, I spent two days
molding them into candles

220
00:11:30,554 --> 00:11:31,579
with my own hands.

221
00:11:31,656 --> 00:11:33,889
I was just asking.

222
00:11:33,928 --> 00:11:37,026
You were criticizing again.

223
00:11:37,068 --> 00:11:39,767
Relax.
She's not going to reject

224
00:11:39,808 --> 00:11:40,901
a prospective daughter

225
00:11:40,943 --> 00:11:42,344
because the <i>var'Hama</i> candles

226
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,213
in her welcoming
display were replicated.

227
00:11:45,253 --> 00:11:46,243
Come in.

228
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,001
<i>Tug son bosh mok</i>
<i>A 'Beh, Sirella koH.</i>

229
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:57,911
<i>E'Gagh vet moh.</i>

230
00:11:57,948 --> 00:12:00,283
What is he doing here?

231
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:01,845
I meant no disrespect.

232
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:03,222
Then leave.

233
00:12:11,477 --> 00:12:15,316
Your worthiness to join
our House will now be judged

234
00:12:15,352 --> 00:12:18,325
according to the traditions
of my family.

235
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:19,726
I am prepared, my lady.

236
00:12:19,762 --> 00:12:21,197
I doubt that.

237
00:12:21,231 --> 00:12:25,639
A Klingon woman would find it
difficult to gain my favor.

238
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:28,237
For... an alien

239
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:30,752
it will most likely
be impossible.

240
00:12:30,786 --> 00:12:32,779
I like a challenge.

241
00:12:32,824 --> 00:12:36,765
I will not have my authority
challenged by you.

242
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:39,236
That's not what I meant.

243
00:12:39,271 --> 00:12:42,301
If you cannot say what you mean,
say nothing at all.

244
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:46,818
The evaluation
will begin tomorrow morning.

245
00:12:46,855 --> 00:12:50,192
Have the traditional meal
prepared before I arrive.

246
00:12:51,832 --> 00:12:53,495
And in the future

247
00:12:53,536 --> 00:12:58,309
if you cannot trouble yourself
to make real <i>var'Hama</i> candles

248
00:12:58,347 --> 00:13:01,183
try not to use
such obvious fakes.

249
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:20,357
You never told me that your wife
was opposed to this marriage.

250
00:13:20,395 --> 00:13:22,525
Sirella is a woman
of strong convictions.

251
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:24,434
She believes
that by bringing aliens

252
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,908
into our families,
we risk losing our identity

253
00:13:26,943 --> 00:13:28,002
as Klingons.

254
00:13:28,045 --> 00:13:30,209
That is a prejudiced,
xenophobic view.

255
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,810
We are Klingons, Worf.

256
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:34,155
We don't embrace other cultures.

257
00:13:34,192 --> 00:13:35,353
We conquer them.

258
00:13:35,394 --> 00:13:36,886
If someone wishes

259
00:13:36,931 --> 00:13:39,562
to join us,
they must honor our traditions

260
00:13:39,604 --> 00:13:41,301
and prove themselves worthy

261
00:13:41,341 --> 00:13:43,744
of wearing the crest
of a Great House.

262
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:45,214
Jadzia is worthy.

263
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,015
Of course she is.

264
00:13:47,053 --> 00:13:50,288
She's an honorable woman
and a formidable warrior.

265
00:13:50,327 --> 00:13:52,263
You should say that to Sirella.

266
00:13:53,268 --> 00:13:55,466
That's not such a good idea.

267
00:13:55,505 --> 00:13:57,669
I don't want her to think

268
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:01,115
that I'm interfering
in her domain.

269
00:14:02,153 --> 00:14:04,123
Perhaps I should speak with her.

270
00:14:04,158 --> 00:14:07,256
Coming from me, it would
not seem like a challenge

271
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:08,267
to her authority.

272
00:14:08,301 --> 00:14:09,770
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

273
00:14:12,343 --> 00:14:13,368
Why?

274
00:14:14,414 --> 00:14:16,247
Well, um...

275
00:14:16,284 --> 00:14:18,983
the truth is...

276
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,461
she doesn't like you
that much either.

277
00:14:21,496 --> 00:14:22,464
Me.

278
00:14:22,498 --> 00:14:25,197
Don't let that bother you.

279
00:14:25,238 --> 00:14:28,211
I had every right
to bring you into the family

280
00:14:28,245 --> 00:14:30,010
and she's accepted the fact

281
00:14:30,048 --> 00:14:32,679
that there's nothing
she can do about it.

282
00:14:32,721 --> 00:14:34,156
How comforting.

283
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:43,701
And they say that you
have no sense of humor.

284
00:15:00,716 --> 00:15:03,017
Phew. I could do
without the heat.

285
00:15:03,054 --> 00:15:06,118
I can't, uh, say much
for the decor either.

286
00:15:06,161 --> 00:15:08,598
Well, it can't be
all fun and games.

287
00:15:08,633 --> 00:15:11,629
I'm sure there has to be
some sort of ritual

288
00:15:11,673 --> 00:15:14,805
we have to go through
before the party begins.

289
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:17,717
There is going to be
a party, isn't there?

290
00:15:17,753 --> 00:15:19,188
You're asking me?

291
00:15:19,223 --> 00:15:22,219
I can barely say
my name in Klingon.

292
00:15:22,262 --> 00:15:24,995
Prepare yourselves, my friends

293
00:15:25,036 --> 00:15:27,769
for a journey
you won't soon forget.

294
00:15:33,454 --> 00:15:34,980
These...

295
00:15:35,024 --> 00:15:36,425
are <i>Ma'Stakas.</i>

296
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,362
What, uh, what do
we do with them?

297
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,734
At the conclusion
of the wedding ceremony

298
00:15:40,771 --> 00:15:43,106
you will use them
to attack Worf and Dax.

299
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,009
Obviously.
Don't you know anything?

300
00:15:45,046 --> 00:15:46,070
The tradition dates back

301
00:15:46,203 --> 00:15:47,797
to the wedding
of Kahless and Lukara

302
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,810
who were nearly killed
by Molor's troops

303
00:15:49,844 --> 00:15:51,438
moments after they were married.

304
00:15:51,481 --> 00:15:52,540
Until the ceremony,

305
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:54,714
you should keep these with you
at all times.

306
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:58,388
I trust
this combat is non-lethal.

307
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:01,061
It is a symbolic attack only.

308
00:16:01,103 --> 00:16:02,298
Oh.

309
00:16:03,775 --> 00:16:06,771
That food is not to be eaten.

310
00:16:08,286 --> 00:16:09,721
Then what is it for?

311
00:16:09,755 --> 00:16:12,922
It is there to tempt us
to break our fast.

312
00:16:12,962 --> 00:16:14,089
Fast?

313
00:16:14,132 --> 00:16:15,692
There are six trials

314
00:16:15,734 --> 00:16:17,967
we must face
on the path to <i>Kal'Hyah.</i>

315
00:16:18,006 --> 00:16:19,908
This is the first...
deprivation.

316
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:22,280
We now begin a fast
that will continue

317
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:24,115
until the day of the wedding.

318
00:16:24,154 --> 00:16:25,919
Well, th-that's four days away.

319
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,450
It is a short time

320
00:16:27,494 --> 00:16:29,795
I know, but we must
make the best of it.

321
00:16:29,832 --> 00:16:32,999
What are
the other five trials?

322
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:36,376
Blood, pain, sacrifice,
anguish...

323
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:37,780
and death.

324
00:16:37,817 --> 00:16:39,480
Sounds like marriage,
all right.

325
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,784
How would you know?

326
00:16:40,824 --> 00:16:42,954
It is time to begin.

327
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:50,136
Need more flowers
on the banister.

328
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:51,874
We're ready with the banner,
boss.

329
00:16:53,117 --> 00:16:54,210
Raise it.

330
00:16:54,253 --> 00:16:55,882
You're up early.

331
00:16:55,923 --> 00:16:57,358
I thought writers slept late.

332
00:16:57,393 --> 00:16:58,361
Not always.

333
00:16:58,396 --> 00:17:00,332
I sold my first book today.

334
00:17:00,366 --> 00:17:03,464
Really?
How much did you get for it?

335
00:17:03,507 --> 00:17:05,409
It's just a figure of speech.

336
00:17:05,444 --> 00:17:06,503
The Federation News Service

337
00:17:06,546 --> 00:17:08,106
is going to publish
a book of my stories

338
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,983
about life on the station
under Dominion rule.

339
00:17:10,021 --> 00:17:11,046
And they're not paying you?

340
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,149
No.

341
00:17:12,192 --> 00:17:14,162
Well, then you have
my sympathies

342
00:17:14,197 --> 00:17:16,030
and the first round
of drinks is on the house.

343
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:17,161
Really?

344
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:20,404
No. It's a figure of speech.

345
00:17:20,444 --> 00:17:22,505
Look, I want to tell
my dad about the book.

346
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:23,710
Is he still in the holosuite?

347
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:26,416
Oh, yeah.
They're still up there.

348
00:17:26,457 --> 00:17:28,393
What are they doing?

349
00:17:28,428 --> 00:17:31,025
It's a Klingon bachelor party.

350
00:17:33,506 --> 00:17:34,873
You're a writer.

351
00:17:34,908 --> 00:17:36,901
Use your imagination.

352
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:40,844
Alexander.

353
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,557
Grandma?

354
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:45,930
Guess again.

355
00:17:49,608 --> 00:17:50,907
We're still on the?

356
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:55,181
The road to <i>Kal'Hyah,</i> day 500.

357
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,281
Maybe we should
turn down the heat

358
00:17:57,324 --> 00:17:59,260
you know, for Alexander's sake.

359
00:17:59,296 --> 00:18:00,423
Oh, no, it's okay.

360
00:18:00,465 --> 00:18:01,455
I, uh...

361
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,496
I just need some water.

362
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,308
Now, you don't want
to push yourself too hard.

363
00:18:07,346 --> 00:18:10,649
You know, turning down the heat
might be a good idea.

364
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,259
The whole point is
to push yourself

365
00:18:14,296 --> 00:18:16,494
to the limits of your endurance.

366
00:18:21,946 --> 00:18:23,175
I will.

367
00:18:23,215 --> 00:18:26,814
I want to travel
the entire path to <i>Kal'Hyah.</i>

368
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:28,588
Stoke the fire again!

369
00:18:28,627 --> 00:18:30,597
As you wish.

370
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:36,702
Of course, we cannot expect
you non-Klingons to...

371
00:18:36,778 --> 00:18:39,113
have the same stamina
as we do.

372
00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:41,916
If you wish to quit,
no one will think

373
00:18:41,956 --> 00:18:43,049
any less of you.

374
00:18:43,092 --> 00:18:44,959
Who said anything
about quitting?

375
00:18:44,996 --> 00:18:46,898
Not me.

376
00:18:46,934 --> 00:18:49,132
I like the heat.

377
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:51,164
That's the spirit.

378
00:18:52,747 --> 00:18:55,082
<i>Kaaa vek ko lee ko</i>

379
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:58,023

387
00:19:19,004 --> 00:19:19,994
Again.

388
00:19:21,343 --> 00:19:23,644
I've done it
three times already.

389
00:19:23,681 --> 00:19:27,052
You continue to rush
through the ceremony,

390
00:19:27,089 --> 00:19:29,253
your body position is poor,

391
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,992
and the placement
of the braziers

392
00:19:32,033 --> 00:19:34,436
on their pedestals is sloppy.

393
00:19:37,211 --> 00:19:39,204
Do you know how heavy
those things are?

394
00:19:40,451 --> 00:19:43,048
A Klingon woman
would not complain.

395
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,117
You wouldn't make
a Klingon woman

396
00:19:45,161 --> 00:19:46,892
do it three times in a row.

397
00:19:46,932 --> 00:19:48,196
I wouldn't have to.

398
00:19:48,235 --> 00:19:50,102
She'd have done it correctly
the first time.

399
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,379
End this now, Jadzia.

400
00:19:55,418 --> 00:19:57,753
Go back to your own people.

401
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:00,694
They will tolerate
your weaknesses

402
00:20:00,729 --> 00:20:03,599
and your failings in a way
that a Klingon family

403
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:04,935
never will.

404
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:08,844
In our House, you would
always be an alien...

405
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,850
an outsider.

406
00:20:10,884 --> 00:20:12,820
At best, you'd be
an object of pity

407
00:20:12,856 --> 00:20:16,854
but you'd never be accepted,
never an equal

408
00:20:16,932 --> 00:20:20,269
because you can never
truly be one of us.

409
00:20:26,987 --> 00:20:29,891
<i>Ko'ma tlang'goS ak-bay</i>

410
00:20:29,993 --> 00:20:33,489
<i>Hava'dak croosh tovaH</i>

411
00:20:33,534 --> 00:20:35,767
<i>Ko'ma Kahless</i>

412
00:20:35,806 --> 00:20:40,749
<i>Ko'ma Kahless,</i>
<i>Ko'ma Kahless.</i>

413
00:20:49,503 --> 00:20:52,908
But the Second Dynasty ended
when General K'Trelan

414
00:20:52,944 --> 00:20:54,914
assassinated Emperor Reclaw.

415
00:20:54,948 --> 00:20:57,944
For the next ten years,
the Empire was ruled

416
00:20:57,988 --> 00:21:00,357
by a Council elected
by the people.

417
00:21:00,394 --> 00:21:02,364
Modern-day Klingon historians

418
00:21:02,398 --> 00:21:05,029
refer to this
as "The Dark Time."

419
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:09,375
But it's interesting to note
that this first and only

420
00:21:09,413 --> 00:21:11,076
experiment in Klingon democracy

421
00:21:11,117 --> 00:21:13,110
actually produced
several reforms...

422
00:21:13,155 --> 00:21:15,683
You are straying from the saga.

423
00:21:15,727 --> 00:21:17,287
Am I?

424
00:21:18,701 --> 00:21:21,868
Your task is to recite
the complete chronicle

425
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:24,378
of the women in my family.

426
00:21:24,412 --> 00:21:26,041
I just thought I'd give you

427
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,919
a broader historical perspective
along the way.

428
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:32,157
I am familiar
with Klingon history.

429
00:21:32,197 --> 00:21:37,539
Now, return to the story
of my 23rd maternal grandmother

430
00:21:37,575 --> 00:21:40,776
Shenara,
daughter of Emperor Reclaw

431
00:21:40,815 --> 00:21:42,911
in the Second Dynasty.

432
00:21:42,954 --> 00:21:46,759
Well, that's where we run
into a little bit of a problem.

433
00:21:46,795 --> 00:21:48,697
You see, I did some research

434
00:21:48,733 --> 00:21:50,966
and when Emperor Reclaw
was killed

435
00:21:51,004 --> 00:21:53,703
all of the members
of the Imperial Family

436
00:21:53,744 --> 00:21:56,215
were put to death,
including Shenara.

437
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,519
When the Third Dynasty
was founded ten years later

438
00:21:59,557 --> 00:22:02,724
a new group of Klingons
were given the titles

439
00:22:02,763 --> 00:22:05,930
and the names of the original
Imperial Family...

440
00:22:05,971 --> 00:22:08,967
to create the illusion
of an unbroken line.

441
00:22:09,044 --> 00:22:11,675
So, the woman that you think of

442
00:22:11,717 --> 00:22:14,382
as your 23rd
maternal grandmother...

443
00:22:14,422 --> 00:22:16,552
isn't related to you at all.

444
00:22:16,594 --> 00:22:19,658
Your real ancestor's name
was Karana

445
00:22:19,701 --> 00:22:23,836
a concubine living outside
the Imperial Stables.

446
00:22:23,877 --> 00:22:27,282
My grandmother's name
was Shenara.

447
00:22:27,318 --> 00:22:29,585
That may be
what's been passed down

448
00:22:29,623 --> 00:22:33,530
from generation to generation,
but it has no basis in fact.

449
00:22:33,564 --> 00:22:35,124
But who cares about facts?

450
00:22:35,168 --> 00:22:38,699
The chronicle says that you have
Imperial blood in your veins

451
00:22:38,743 --> 00:22:41,875
and that's exactly what we'll
keep telling everyone.

452
00:22:45,391 --> 00:22:48,511
Continue with the saga.

453
00:22:48,643 --> 00:22:51,114
My pleasure.

454
00:22:53,154 --> 00:22:54,315
Hey, Major.

455
00:22:54,356 --> 00:22:56,121
Is it true Dax is having
a party tomorrow night?

456
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,561
Ah, news travels fast.

457
00:22:57,597 --> 00:22:59,066
Well, is it by invitation or?

458
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,159
I'm sure you're welcome.

459
00:23:00,202 --> 00:23:02,172
And you can tell Nog
the same goes for him, too.

460
00:23:02,207 --> 00:23:03,175
Great.

461
00:23:03,209 --> 00:23:05,179
Oh, I understand
congratulations are in order

462
00:23:05,213 --> 00:23:06,580
to our newest published author.

463
00:23:06,617 --> 00:23:07,744
Thank you.

464
00:23:12,396 --> 00:23:13,729
What was all that about?

465
00:23:13,766 --> 00:23:14,734
Nothing.

466
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,032
There they go.

467
00:23:18,075 --> 00:23:19,942
They look so serious.

468
00:23:19,979 --> 00:23:21,278
It's all an act.

469
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,945
They don't want
the rest of us to know

470
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:24,615
what kind of debauchery
they're up to.

471
00:23:24,657 --> 00:23:25,647
Like what?

472
00:23:27,763 --> 00:23:30,200
It's a Klingon bachelor party.

473
00:23:30,235 --> 00:23:32,365
Use your imagination.

474
00:23:37,451 --> 00:23:39,979
Now begins the Trial of Blood.

475
00:23:40,023 --> 00:23:42,824
Let rivers flow from our veins.

476
00:23:42,862 --> 00:23:44,593
Who will be first?

477
00:23:53,186 --> 00:23:56,182
I did not expect it
to be you, Doctor.

478
00:23:58,932 --> 00:24:00,127
Neither did I.

479
00:24:00,167 --> 00:24:01,294
Do not worry.

480
00:24:01,337 --> 00:24:04,104
The pain will last
for only a moment.

481
00:24:11,426 --> 00:24:12,587
Ta-hoo!

482
00:24:30,267 --> 00:24:32,032
Isn't that grand?

483
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,630
Yeah! Whoo!

484
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,649
All right!
He's unbelievable.

485
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:41,054
He's something.

486
00:24:44,665 --> 00:24:49,198
Lieutenant Manuele Atoa
from the Starship <i>Sutherland.</i>

487
00:24:49,242 --> 00:24:51,338
I've never seen
anything like that.

488
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,507
Neither have I.

489
00:24:55,957 --> 00:24:57,517
Let's get something to eat.

490
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:01,366
A woman of many talents.

491
00:25:01,402 --> 00:25:04,807
It's a shame she's
about to waste them all

492
00:25:04,843 --> 00:25:07,679
on that walking frown
she calls a fiancé.

493
00:25:07,716 --> 00:25:09,049
She's too good for him.

494
00:25:09,086 --> 00:25:10,419
I've said that
from the beginning.

495
00:25:10,455 --> 00:25:11,616
Are you jealous?

496
00:25:13,128 --> 00:25:14,859
There's no profit in jealousy.

497
00:25:14,899 --> 00:25:17,268
That's not a denial.

498
00:25:20,277 --> 00:25:22,304
It's not to be quoted either.

499
00:25:22,348 --> 00:25:23,373
Oh, don't worry.

500
00:25:23,417 --> 00:25:24,784
So when did you first realize

501
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,346
you had these feelings for Dax?

502
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,554
Quark, wait.

503
00:25:36,446 --> 00:25:37,414
Miles?

504
00:25:37,448 --> 00:25:39,111
Yeah?

505
00:25:39,152 --> 00:25:42,284
It's working.

506
00:25:42,326 --> 00:25:43,955
I've had a vision...

507
00:25:43,996 --> 00:25:45,966
about the future.

508
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,836
I can see it so clearly.

509
00:25:50,343 --> 00:25:51,903
What is it?

510
00:25:54,485 --> 00:25:56,888
I'm going to kill Worf.

511
00:25:58,394 --> 00:26:00,296
I'm going to kill Worf.

512
00:26:00,331 --> 00:26:02,700
That's what I'm going to do.

513
00:26:02,737 --> 00:26:04,833
I can see it clearly now.

514
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:06,742
I'm going to kill him.

515
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:08,078
Kill Worf.

516
00:26:08,115 --> 00:26:10,643
- Kill Worf.
- Kill Worf.

517
00:26:10,688 --> 00:26:11,917
Kill Worf.

518
00:26:13,293 --> 00:26:14,557
Kill Worf.

519
00:26:32,436 --> 00:26:35,876
I've been getting complaints
about the noise.

520
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:38,279
Someone even mentioned a fight?

521
00:26:38,315 --> 00:26:40,012
Oh, there was a scuffle

522
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:42,818
between Morn
and one of the Bolians

523
00:26:42,858 --> 00:26:44,452
but they worked it out.

524
00:26:44,495 --> 00:26:46,488
How long will this...

525
00:26:46,533 --> 00:26:48,196
party continue?

526
00:26:48,237 --> 00:26:52,235
This party will continue
until further notice

527
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:56,276
on the personal authority
of this station's First Officer

528
00:26:56,321 --> 00:26:57,620
who just happens to be me.

529
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:58,716
Mm-hmm.

530
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:00,558
You're in a good mood.

531
00:27:00,597 --> 00:27:02,932
Well, it's a good party.

532
00:27:03,971 --> 00:27:05,463
Well...

533
00:27:05,508 --> 00:27:06,533
Odo...

534
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,679
Odo...

535
00:27:09,717 --> 00:27:12,781
I think we have
a lot to talk about.

536
00:27:13,926 --> 00:27:14,894
I agree.

537
00:27:14,929 --> 00:27:16,626
So let's talk.

538
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:18,533
Now?

539
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,700
Don't you think we've
put it off long enough?

540
00:27:22,879 --> 00:27:24,872
Enjoy yourselves.

541
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,151
Let's, um...

542
00:27:28,191 --> 00:27:30,252
find someplace a little quieter.

543
00:27:39,749 --> 00:27:41,742
Thanks for the show.

544
00:27:41,788 --> 00:27:43,781
Thanks for getting me
the day off.

545
00:27:43,825 --> 00:27:45,624
Captain Shelby owed me a favor.

546
00:27:45,662 --> 00:27:47,256
Actually, owed me several.

547
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:49,702
In fact, how would
you like to have

548
00:27:49,738 --> 00:27:51,605
another two days off?

549
00:27:51,643 --> 00:27:53,112
Two?

550
00:27:53,179 --> 00:27:54,648
What do I have to do?

551
00:27:54,682 --> 00:27:55,650
Not much.

552
00:27:55,684 --> 00:27:57,620
Just give me something
fun to look at

553
00:27:57,656 --> 00:27:59,489
for the rest of the evening.

554
00:27:59,526 --> 00:28:00,494
Anything else?

555
00:28:00,528 --> 00:28:02,521
I'll let you know.

556
00:28:02,567 --> 00:28:04,161
You!

557
00:28:05,673 --> 00:28:08,042
Leave her
or I'll cut your head off

558
00:28:08,078 --> 00:28:09,843
and hang it from my belt.

559
00:28:09,882 --> 00:28:11,647
I'll take care of this.

560
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:15,287
You weren't invited.

561
00:28:15,328 --> 00:28:18,095
It is time
for the <i>Bre'Nan</i> ritual.

562
00:28:18,134 --> 00:28:19,797
I'm busy.

563
00:28:19,837 --> 00:28:23,538
Busy acting like a Risian slut.

564
00:28:24,548 --> 00:28:26,985
I'm only going to ask
you to leave once.

565
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,423
You will come
with me now and perform

566
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:31,896
the Bre'Nan ritual
to my satisfaction

567
00:28:31,931 --> 00:28:33,958
or I will cancel your wedding.

568
00:28:34,002 --> 00:28:35,403
<i>Toruk-DOH!</i>

569
00:28:37,911 --> 00:28:39,312
Ladies, please.

570
00:28:39,348 --> 00:28:42,844
<i>Mok'Ta vor kash a'VEH!</i>

571
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:52,000
Why is everyone standing around?

572
00:28:52,042 --> 00:28:54,172
The party's
just getting started.

573
00:28:54,214 --> 00:28:55,513
Play something!

574
00:29:14,056 --> 00:29:16,357
Double <i>raktajino,</i> extra sweet.

575
00:29:20,371 --> 00:29:22,899
What time is it?

576
00:29:22,943 --> 00:29:24,469
1030 hours.

577
00:29:25,715 --> 00:29:26,842
Come on.

578
00:29:30,626 --> 00:29:32,687
Wrong door.

579
00:29:39,078 --> 00:29:41,048
Excuse me, sir.

580
00:29:49,568 --> 00:29:50,693
Jadzia, we need to...

581
00:29:50,693 --> 00:29:52,356
Jadzia, we need to...

582
00:29:55,537 --> 00:29:57,507
You're mad.

583
00:29:57,541 --> 00:29:59,808
I am concerned.

584
00:29:59,846 --> 00:30:01,839
Yeah, well, I'm hung over.

585
00:30:01,951 --> 00:30:03,386
Can we talk later?

586
00:30:03,421 --> 00:30:05,790
We have a very serious problem.

587
00:30:05,826 --> 00:30:08,491
Sirella has canceled
the wedding.

588
00:30:08,533 --> 00:30:11,403
She doesn't waste
any time, does she?

589
00:30:11,438 --> 00:30:13,568
She said you attacked her.

590
00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:17,210
She pulled a knife.

591
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:24,865
You are forbidden to join
the House of Martok.

592
00:30:24,901 --> 00:30:27,840
So I won't be invited
to the family picnics.

593
00:30:27,875 --> 00:30:29,538
I'll live.

594
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:31,014
I cannot believe
how you're taking

595
00:30:31,049 --> 00:30:32,039
this so lightly.

596
00:30:32,084 --> 00:30:33,576
Do you hear that?

597
00:30:33,621 --> 00:30:35,090
What?

598
00:30:36,627 --> 00:30:38,757
It sounds like voices.

599
00:30:43,476 --> 00:30:45,674
- Hi.
- Hi.

600
00:30:45,714 --> 00:30:47,844
Is the party over?

601
00:30:47,886 --> 00:30:49,947
You could say that.

602
00:30:50,023 --> 00:30:51,116
It's 10:30.

603
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:52,594
In the morning?

604
00:30:52,629 --> 00:30:53,790
I'm on duty.

605
00:30:53,832 --> 00:30:55,301
So am I.

606
00:30:55,335 --> 00:30:56,634
It was a great party.

607
00:30:56,671 --> 00:30:58,072
Thanks.

608
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:07,217
We must deal
with the situation now.

609
00:31:07,261 --> 00:31:08,422
Stop yelling.

610
00:31:08,463 --> 00:31:09,692
My head hurts.

611
00:31:10,936 --> 00:31:13,932
You must go to Sirella
and beg her forgiveness.

612
00:31:21,426 --> 00:31:22,952
I don't beg.

613
00:31:23,029 --> 00:31:26,696
You are allowing
your pride to blind you.

614
00:31:26,737 --> 00:31:27,705
Look who's talking.

615
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,801
You want me to go crawling
to some old hag

616
00:31:29,844 --> 00:31:32,543
just so you can have your
traditional Klingon wedding.

617
00:31:32,583 --> 00:31:35,111
This is about more
than just tradition.

618
00:31:37,527 --> 00:31:40,864
You and I have embarked
on a spiritual journey

619
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:42,495
one that will bind us together

620
00:31:42,538 --> 00:31:44,839
through this life
and into the next.

621
00:31:44,877 --> 00:31:46,278
You cannot turn back now.

622
00:31:46,314 --> 00:31:48,979
Maybe you're on a
spiritual journey, Worf

623
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,013
but I just want to get married.

624
00:31:51,058 --> 00:31:54,759
So why don't you go back
to sweating and bleeding

625
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,530
with your friends
in the holosuite

626
00:31:56,569 --> 00:31:57,902
and when you're done

627
00:31:57,939 --> 00:31:59,738
meet me in Benjamin's office

628
00:31:59,777 --> 00:32:01,144
and he'll perform the ceremony.

629
00:32:09,665 --> 00:32:14,004
If that is your attitude...

630
00:32:14,075 --> 00:32:16,945
perhaps Sirella
was right about you.

631
00:32:19,587 --> 00:32:21,956
There should be no wedding.

632
00:32:23,261 --> 00:32:25,163
That's fine with me.

633
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:49,676
What's going on?

634
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,745
Haven't you heard?

635
00:32:50,788 --> 00:32:51,813
The wedding's off.

636
00:32:51,857 --> 00:32:53,588
Off? Why?

637
00:32:53,629 --> 00:32:57,764
She says it's because he's
a pig-headed, stubborn man

638
00:32:57,804 --> 00:33:00,800
who puts tradition
before everything else.

639
00:33:00,844 --> 00:33:03,543
He says it's because
she's a frivolous

640
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:04,847
emotional woman

641
00:33:04,886 --> 00:33:07,585
who refuses to take him
or his culture seriously.

642
00:33:07,625 --> 00:33:09,618
You can see the problem.

643
00:33:09,664 --> 00:33:11,361
They're both right.

644
00:33:11,401 --> 00:33:12,562
Exactly.

645
00:33:12,603 --> 00:33:15,770
Well... there's only
one thing for it.

646
00:33:17,214 --> 00:33:19,549
Dinner.

647
00:33:19,586 --> 00:33:21,283
I'll get the menu.

648
00:33:31,478 --> 00:33:32,811
Enter.

649
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,800
Worf...

650
00:33:41,834 --> 00:33:44,203
you've made a grave error.

651
00:33:46,344 --> 00:33:49,145
Perhaps.

652
00:33:49,217 --> 00:33:51,450
Do you still love her?

653
00:33:51,489 --> 00:33:53,550
Of course.

654
00:33:53,593 --> 00:33:56,794
However, in this case, that...

655
00:33:56,833 --> 00:33:58,427
may not be enough.

656
00:34:00,742 --> 00:34:03,738
Anyone can see that we are
hopelessly mismatched.

657
00:34:03,783 --> 00:34:06,084
She is a Trill;
I am a Klingon.

658
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,921
She has had five marriages.

659
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,124
This would be my first.

660
00:34:11,198 --> 00:34:13,999
When she is laughing,
I am somber.

661
00:34:14,038 --> 00:34:16,134
When I am happy, she is crying.

662
00:34:16,176 --> 00:34:19,149
She plays <i>tongo</i> with
the Ferengi bartender.

663
00:34:19,249 --> 00:34:21,720
I can barely stand him.

664
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:26,598
She mocks everything...

665
00:34:26,632 --> 00:34:29,399
while I take
everything seriously.

666
00:34:32,178 --> 00:34:37,019
She is nothing like the woman
I thought I would marry.

667
00:34:37,055 --> 00:34:39,356
We are not accorded
the luxury

668
00:34:39,394 --> 00:34:42,834
of choosing the women
we fall in love with.

669
00:34:42,868 --> 00:34:46,000
Do you think Sirella
is anything like the woman

670
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:49,503
I thought that I'd marry?

671
00:34:49,549 --> 00:34:54,322
She is a prideful,
arrogant, mercurial woman

672
00:34:54,360 --> 00:35:00,671
who shares my bed far too
infrequently for my taste.

673
00:35:00,707 --> 00:35:04,169
And yet...

674
00:35:04,215 --> 00:35:06,618
I love her...

675
00:35:06,654 --> 00:35:08,647
deeply.

676
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:10,422
Hmm.

677
00:35:10,463 --> 00:35:14,962
We Klingons often tout our...

678
00:35:15,005 --> 00:35:17,442
prowess in battle...

679
00:35:17,478 --> 00:35:21,442
our desire for glory and honor
above all else...

680
00:35:23,257 --> 00:35:27,028
but how hollow is
the sound of victory...

681
00:35:27,065 --> 00:35:28,830
without someone
to share it with?

682
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:32,207
Honor gives little comfort

683
00:35:32,244 --> 00:35:34,841
to a man alone in his home...

684
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:37,081
and in his heart.

685
00:35:43,301 --> 00:35:44,600
One steak with mushrooms

686
00:35:44,637 --> 00:35:46,539
baked potato, sour cream
and chives.

687
00:35:46,575 --> 00:35:47,839
I should have had that.

688
00:35:47,877 --> 00:35:50,873
One double Altair sandwich,
no mustard...

689
00:35:50,918 --> 00:35:52,820
two bowls of linguini

690
00:35:52,855 --> 00:35:56,090
Bajoran shrimp
with extra cheese.

691
00:35:56,129 --> 00:35:59,159
One loaf of mapa bread.

692
00:35:59,202 --> 00:36:00,694
Quark, where's the <i>kava</i> juice?

693
00:36:00,739 --> 00:36:02,106
They're still
squeezing the roots

694
00:36:02,142 --> 00:36:03,577
unless you want replicated.

695
00:36:03,612 --> 00:36:04,979
We'll wait.

696
00:36:05,015 --> 00:36:07,042
What do you think you're doing?

697
00:36:08,423 --> 00:36:09,618
The wedding's been called off.

698
00:36:09,658 --> 00:36:10,683
It's back on.

699
00:36:10,728 --> 00:36:13,359
Worf is apologizing
to Jadzia

700
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,664
at this very moment.

701
00:36:14,704 --> 00:36:16,173
Quark, take it all away.

702
00:36:16,206 --> 00:36:18,507
No food for those
on the path to <i>Kal'Hyah.</i>

703
00:36:18,545 --> 00:36:22,246
No refunds for those
on the path to <i>Kal'Hyah</i> as well.

704
00:36:22,287 --> 00:36:23,654
Sorry.

705
00:36:28,266 --> 00:36:30,499
Father, what happened?

706
00:36:32,909 --> 00:36:34,845
She refused to change her mind

707
00:36:34,881 --> 00:36:37,079
and the wedding is still off.

708
00:36:38,389 --> 00:36:39,482
Where is she?

709
00:36:39,524 --> 00:36:41,517
In her quarters.

710
00:36:41,562 --> 00:36:43,658
I'll go talk to her.

711
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,696
Just... keep them away
from the food?

712
00:36:54,691 --> 00:36:56,160
Come in!

713
00:36:57,931 --> 00:36:59,332
Save your breath.

714
00:36:59,368 --> 00:37:01,839
Worf's gone too far,
and now it's over.

715
00:37:01,873 --> 00:37:03,412
Do you know
what he wanted me to do?

716
00:37:03,545 --> 00:37:06,985
He wanted me to go crawling
on my hands and knees to Sirella

717
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:08,420
to beg her forgiveness.

718
00:37:08,456 --> 00:37:09,948
Beg her! Me!

719
00:37:09,993 --> 00:37:11,724
I was once

720
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:14,827
the Federation Ambassador
to the Klingon Empire.

721
00:37:16,741 --> 00:37:19,042
I negotiated
the Khitomer Accords

722
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,515
before Worf was even born.

723
00:37:20,549 --> 00:37:22,348
Curzon negotiated the Accords!

724
00:37:22,387 --> 00:37:24,357
And I've got news for you,
old man.

725
00:37:24,391 --> 00:37:25,917
You're not Curzon anymore.

726
00:37:25,961 --> 00:37:28,022
And what the hell is that
supposed to mean?

727
00:37:28,065 --> 00:37:30,058
It means that you
can't expect Sirella

728
00:37:30,104 --> 00:37:31,437
to treat you like Curzon

729
00:37:31,474 --> 00:37:33,501
just because you carry
his memories.

730
00:37:33,545 --> 00:37:35,447
To her, you're
just a young woman

731
00:37:35,482 --> 00:37:37,749
who decided to marry
into her family.

732
00:37:37,787 --> 00:37:40,817
If it means you have to bow down
and kiss her boots

733
00:37:40,894 --> 00:37:44,197
that's exactly what you have
to do, and you knew that.

734
00:37:44,235 --> 00:37:46,262
The moment you decided
to marry Worf

735
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:49,210
you knew that sooner or later
you'd have to bow down

736
00:37:49,246 --> 00:37:51,547
and show her the respect
that she's due.

737
00:37:51,585 --> 00:37:53,214
This is Worf's fault...

738
00:37:53,255 --> 00:37:55,556
Worf and his traditional
Klingon wedding.

739
00:37:55,593 --> 00:37:58,326
Well, he may have let
this wedding business

740
00:37:58,366 --> 00:38:02,033
go to his head,
but you are 356 years old.

741
00:38:02,074 --> 00:38:04,807
Compared to you,
Worf is just a kid

742
00:38:04,847 --> 00:38:08,116
and if you can't abide
by Klingon traditions

743
00:38:08,153 --> 00:38:10,488
then you never should
have let yourself

744
00:38:10,525 --> 00:38:14,090
fall in love with him
in the first place.

745
00:38:14,134 --> 00:38:17,505
And you are in love with him.

746
00:38:19,947 --> 00:38:22,384
I wasn't looking
to fall in love.

747
00:38:22,419 --> 00:38:25,084
I was perfectly happy
by myself.

748
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:28,656
I had friends, a career,
adventure...

749
00:38:31,438 --> 00:38:34,434
Then one day...

750
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:39,649
this Klingon with a bad attitude
walked into my life

751
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:43,756
and the next thing I know,
I'm getting married.

752
00:38:43,799 --> 00:38:49,141
After 356 years
and seven lifetimes...

753
00:38:49,178 --> 00:38:51,411
I still lead with my heart.

754
00:38:51,449 --> 00:38:53,078
You know, that is

755
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,682
what I've always loved
about you.

756
00:38:58,398 --> 00:39:01,165
And I think that's why
Worf loves you, too.

757
00:39:10,491 --> 00:39:13,760
Whatever happened
to that young, callow Ensign

758
00:39:13,798 --> 00:39:16,429
I used to know?

759
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:21,915
The one who used to turn to me
for advice all the time?

760
00:39:21,983 --> 00:39:26,118
You know, the one with hair?

761
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:28,152
I grew up.

762
00:39:31,805 --> 00:39:35,245
I guess it's time
I grow up, too.

763
00:39:35,279 --> 00:39:37,272
Mmm.

764
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:19,632
With fire and steel

765
00:40:19,676 --> 00:40:23,275
did the gods forge
the Klingon heart.

766
00:40:23,317 --> 00:40:25,344
So fiercely did it beat

767
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:29,387
so loud was the sound,
that the gods cried out

768
00:40:29,431 --> 00:40:31,959
"On this day
we have brought forth

769
00:40:32,003 --> 00:40:35,670
"the strongest heart
in all the heavens.

770
00:40:35,711 --> 00:40:39,584
"None can stand before it
without trembling

771
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,853
at its strength."

772
00:40:41,892 --> 00:40:44,022
But then the Klingon heart
weakened

773
00:40:44,063 --> 00:40:46,694
its steady rhythm faltered
and the gods said

774
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:48,729
"Why have you weakened so?

775
00:40:48,773 --> 00:40:53,773
"We have made you the strongest
in all of creation."

776
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:55,685
And the heart said...

777
00:40:55,722 --> 00:40:58,786
I am alone.

778
00:40:58,829 --> 00:41:01,494
And the gods knew
that they had erred.

779
00:41:01,534 --> 00:41:03,903
So they went back to their forge

780
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:06,468
and brought forth...
another heart.

781
00:41:35,476 --> 00:41:39,417
But the second heart
beat stronger than the first

782
00:41:39,452 --> 00:41:42,425
and the first was jealous
of its power.

783
00:41:46,968 --> 00:41:48,369
Fortunately...

784
00:41:48,404 --> 00:41:51,844
the second heart was tempered
by wisdom.

785
00:41:51,879 --> 00:41:56,082
If we join together,
no force can stop us.

786
00:42:03,003 --> 00:42:06,808
And when the two hearts
began to beat together

787
00:42:06,845 --> 00:42:10,684
they filled the heavens
with a terrible sound.

788
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,353
For the first time,
the gods knew fear.

789
00:42:14,395 --> 00:42:17,891
They tried to flee,
but it was too late.

790
00:42:17,936 --> 00:42:21,137
The Klingon hearts
destroyed the gods

791
00:42:21,177 --> 00:42:22,167
who created them

792
00:42:22,245 --> 00:42:25,081
and turned the heavens
to ashes.

793
00:42:25,118 --> 00:42:27,054
To this very day

794
00:42:27,089 --> 00:42:32,226
no one can oppose the beating
of two Klingon hearts.

795
00:42:34,739 --> 00:42:37,643
Not even me.

796
00:42:40,919 --> 00:42:45,054
Worf, son of Mogh,
does your heart beat

797
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:47,589
only for this woman?

798
00:42:47,634 --> 00:42:48,829
Yes.

799
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:52,332
And will you swear
to join with her

800
00:42:52,378 --> 00:42:55,715
and stand with her
against all who oppose you?

801
00:42:55,752 --> 00:42:58,383
I swear.

802
00:42:58,424 --> 00:43:00,952
Jadzia, daughter of Kela

803
00:43:00,997 --> 00:43:04,995
does your heart beat
only for this man?

804
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:07,100
Yes.

805
00:43:07,144 --> 00:43:09,342
And do you swear
to join with him

806
00:43:09,383 --> 00:43:10,373
and stand with him

807
00:43:10,418 --> 00:43:12,285
against all
who would oppose you?

808
00:43:13,558 --> 00:43:15,460
I swear.

809
00:43:15,496 --> 00:43:17,694
Then let all present

810
00:43:17,734 --> 00:43:22,507
here today, know that
this man and this woman

811
00:43:22,544 --> 00:43:24,104
are married.

812
00:43:31,764 --> 00:43:32,959
Now?

813
00:43:33,001 --> 00:43:34,994
Not yet.

814
00:43:42,455 --> 00:43:43,423
Now?

815
00:43:43,457 --> 00:43:45,450
Patience.

816
00:43:47,734 --> 00:43:50,297
My Lady.

817
00:43:50,373 --> 00:43:54,474
Welcome to the House
of Martok...

818
00:43:54,515 --> 00:43:56,508
my daughter.

819
00:44:00,695 --> 00:44:01,924
Now, Doctor!
