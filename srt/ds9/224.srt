00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,746
(<i> static hissing</i> )

2
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,461
Nerys?

3
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:47,006
Vedek Bareil.

4
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:48,632
Wanna play?

5
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,261
Help me.

6
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,098
Please.

7
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:01,020
(<i> sighs</i> )
All right.

8
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:10,779
Who is it?

9
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:16,911
It's Prylar Bek.

10
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:18,746
No, it's not.

11
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,083
It's you.

12
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,862
KIRA:
Good morning.

13
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:58,197
(<i> chuckling</i> )

14
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:00,908
I thought you'd sleep
till noon.

15
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:06,371
Shh... you're supposed
to be relaxing.

16
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,332
Oh, I'm very relaxed.

17
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,376
Good.

18
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,587
How are you feeling
this morning?

19
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,923
Oh, miserable.

20
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:18,550
I wish you could
stay here longer.

21
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,220
All right, I will.

22
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,304
I'll stay a
few more days.

23
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,224
You know
you can't do that.

24
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:26,641
Why not?

25
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,393
Because in two days,

26
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,271
you are going
to be elected kai.

27
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,232
Hmm?

28
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:36,068
Oh,<i> that!</i>

29
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:39,279
You know, there's
no guarantee
I'm going to win.

30
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,240
Of course,
you're going to win.

31
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,617
The people need you.

32
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,664
Are you...

33
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,625
going to vote for me?

34
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:54,962
Ho, ho!

35
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:58,757
Is<i> that</i> why you spent
the last three days here, huh?

36
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:01,760
To get my vote?

37
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,720
Well, I know
you don't agree

38
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,264
with many of my views,

39
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:08,267
so I thought
a personal appearance

40
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:10,144
might sway your opinion.

41
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:13,521
I was going to vote
for Vedek Tolena.

42
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,947
But I might be persuaded
to change my mind.

43
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,951
Good.

44
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,244
Because your vote

45
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,955
is the only one
that matters to me.

46
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,376
I may not always agree

47
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,879
with your interpretations
of the prophecies,

48
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:42,259
but I think you will make
a wonderful kai.

49
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,303
Besides, everyone knows

50
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:47,764
that you were Kai Opaka's
personal choice to succeed her.

51
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,897
I could never replace Opaka.

52
00:05:55,897 --> 00:06:00,735
Bajor wouldn't have survived
the occupation without her.

53
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,154
Once you become kai,

54
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:05,157
we'll never have
these times together.

55
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:06,950
Listen to me.

56
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,077
No matter how
busy I become,

57
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,872
I will always have
time for you.

58
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,207
It won't be easy.

59
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:14,958
I didn't say
it would be.

60
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:19,546
I'm not going to
lose you, Nerys.

61
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,256
I promise you that.

62
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:30,057
Remember now,
honor the Prophets

63
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,726
and they will
always love you.

64
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,145
As I understand
the sacred texts,

65
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,898
the Prophets' love
is unconditional.

66
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,317
They ask nothing
in return.

67
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:43,444
Thank you,
Vedek Bareil,
for reminding us

68
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:46,948
how the sacred text can be
so easily misinterpreted.

69
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,993
Nothing pleases me more
than providing you

70
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,745
with an opposing viewpoint,
Vedek Winn.

71
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:55,082
Somehow you never
fail to do that.

72
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:57,667
I had no idea you
were on the station,

73
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:01,004
but perhaps I shouldn't
be so surprised.

74
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,757
Oh, I wouldn't even
try to surprise you.

75
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,634
I understand you've
been keeping a close eye

76
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,887
on my activities
these last few weeks.

77
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:12,849
The eyes of all of Bajor
are focused on you, Bareil.

78
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,851
Why should I be
any different?

79
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,187
After all, the
common wisdom

80
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:20,690
is that you are destined
to be the next kai.

81
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,651
Was that a concession speech?
Hardly.

82
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:26,613
The choosing is still
two days away.

83
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,699
The Prophets may yet
surprise us all.

84
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,534
Remember that, Bareil.

85
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,827
I would hate
for you

86
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,955
to start celebrating
prematurely.

87
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:38,292
What brings you to the station,
Vedek Winn?

88
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,252
My child, if I thought
the Prophets

89
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:42,670
wanted you to know
the purpose of my visit,

90
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,881
I would have informed you
of it in advance.

91
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,884
Well, now that I know
you're here, I'll be sure

92
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:51,179
to inform Constable Odo
to increase station security.

93
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,098
That won't be necessary.

94
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,849
I feel quite safe here.

95
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:58,061
No, it wasn't<i> your</i> safety
that concerned me.

96
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:01,356
Just what are you trying
to infer, child?

97
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,566
I'm sure
Major Kira meant

98
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,986
no disrespect.

99
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,321
No, not at all.

100
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:09,697
I just want to
avoid the violence

101
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:12,326
that occurred during
your last visit.

102
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:16,288
My child, I know
you still hold me responsible

103
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:20,459
for the deplorable attempt
on Vedek Bareil's life,

104
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:23,586
but I can only pray
that some day,

105
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,798
you will be cured of
this unfortunate misconception.

106
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:29,968
Well, that's one prayer
that will never be answered.

107
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:32,887
What a pity, for both of us.

108
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:39,560
Ooh!
Oh! Excuse me.

109
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:52,907
Uh, excuse me.

110
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,242
Don't I know you?

111
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,910
You must
be mistaken.

112
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,954
No, no, I've
seen you before.

113
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:01,333
You're... Kubus,
that's it.

114
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,792
Kubus Oak.

115
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,627
You worked for
the Cardassians.

116
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,962
Out of my way!

117
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,173
Now, you wait a minute!

118
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,509
You're not going anywhere.

119
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:14,095
I know who you are,
and I know what you did!

120
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,014
You're a traitor!

121
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,099
This is Kubus Oak!

122
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,434
He's a traitor!

123
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:22,979
He worked
for the Cardassians!

124
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,647
What's going on here?

125
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,107
See for yourself.

126
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,404
Secretary Kubus.

127
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:33,573
Last I heard, you were
living on Cardassia.

128
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,867
I decided it was time
to come home.

129
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,618
Welcome back.

130
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,287
You're under arrest.

131
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,873
(<i> mutters of approval</i> )

132
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,018
The Prophets
have spoken.

133
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,354
All blessings
on the new Kai.

134
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:07,566
ALL:
Blessings on the Kai.

135
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:10,110
May the Prophets guide you.

136
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:21,788
Kai Opaka.

137
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:30,671
Be at peace, my child.

138
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:34,384
You must be strong,
now more than ever.

139
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:37,220
Why did you
leave us?

140
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,390
All is as the Prophets
will it to be,

141
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,767
as you will learn.

142
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,062
Follow me.

143
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,648
Be careful, Bareil.

144
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,485
The path she walks
is a narrow one.

145
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:53,736
See that you
don't stumble.

146
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,780
Heed her words.

147
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,284
But I don't deserve
to walk in your path.

148
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:02,621
You must.
It is your destiny.

149
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:18,052
Prylar Bek?

150
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:23,517
Accept this gift
from the Prophets.

151
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:37,489
You must not refuse
their offering.

152
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,785
Take it,
my child.

153
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,579
Its venom will
make you stronger.

154
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,747
(<i> hissing</i> )

155
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,693
There was quite a mob
gathering out there.

156
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:17,320
I had to call in
extra security

157
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,988
to disperse it.

158
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:23,535
I never doubted your ability
to handle the situation, Odo.

159
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:25,744
You always were good
at your job.

160
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:30,542
I could say the same for you,
Secretary Kubus...

161
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:34,087
special liaison between
the Cardassian occupation forces

162
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,548
and their pawns
in the Bajoran government.

163
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:39,050
I served the only
recognized government

164
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,052
on Bajor during
the occupation.

165
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:43,388
Recognized by the Cardassians.

166
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:46,474
If it wasn't for us,
the situation on Bajor

167
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:49,644
would have been ten times
worse than it was.

168
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,854
Maybe, but I don't see
how you could know that

169
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:55,191
seeing that you spent nearly all
your time here on the station.

170
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:58,319
I remember Gul Dukat
telling me once

171
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,572
that you were
his favorite Bajoran.

172
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:04,992
Really? Well, I never could
stand that arrogant tyrant!

173
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,994
You hid your
feelings well.

174
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,414
It kept me
alive.

175
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,585
Bajor is my home.

176
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:18,548
I never should have left it.

177
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:21,301
KIRA:
But you did...

178
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:24,095
and you're going to have
to live with that decision.

179
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,890
This is Major Kira,

180
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,602
the highest-ranking Bajoran
on the station.

181
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:33,313
Then I suppose you're the one
I should be talking to.

182
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,939
Make it brief.

183
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,108
I don't enjoy
talking to collaborators.

184
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,235
I'm not asking you to like me.

185
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,904
I'm simply requesting that I be
allowed to return home.

186
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,197
Your request is denied.

187
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,783
I doubt if
you have

188
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:46,618
the authority
to make that decision.

189
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:49,078
The decision has
already been made.

190
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,997
In the Ilvian Proclamation,

191
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,915
every Bajoran
who was a member

192
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,168
of the Cardassian
occupational government

193
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,253
was sentenced to exile.

194
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,799
Your name was number four
on that list.

195
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:05,011
Personally, I think
you all got off too easy.

196
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,099
Major...

197
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,018
I'm an old man.

198
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,894
I don't have
many years left.

199
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:17,398
What's the harm of letting me
live them out on Bajor?

200
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,400
When the Cardassians needed

201
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,612
a new group of Bajorans
to work in the mines,

202
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:25,532
who approved
those work orders?

203
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,701
The Bajoran government.

204
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:31,412
Whose signature was
on those authorization forms?

205
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,376
Mine.
And you had to know

206
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,628
that those authorizations
were death sentences.

207
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:41,840
Did you ever once refuse
to sign them?

208
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,968
No.

209
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:49,138
And that's why
you can never be allowed

210
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,265
to set foot on Bajor again.

211
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:54,101
Because, if you do,
it would dishonor

212
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:58,105
the memory of every person
you sentenced to death.

213
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:20,211
Vedek Winn.
What can I do for you?

214
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:23,297
Emissary...

215
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,675
it has recently come
to my attention

216
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:28,553
that there are
some on Bajor who believe

217
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:32,557
that my relationship with you
is not all it should be.

218
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:35,560
Really?

219
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,228
Personally,
I find

220
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:39,689
such a perception,
however inaccurate,

221
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,399
to be most distressing.

222
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,234
I suppose
the question

223
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:44,944
we have to ask ourselves

224
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,614
is whether or not
that perception is inaccurate.

225
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:51,117
Don't tell me
that you yourself, Emissary,

226
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:54,454
believe that you and I are...

227
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,664
how shall I put it?

228
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,458
Enemies?

229
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,461
At odds.

230
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,004
Well...

231
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,466
let's see.

232
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:10,428
How could I have come
to such a conclusion?

233
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:13,514
Maybe it has something
to do with the fact

234
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,642
that the last time
you were here at this station,

235
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:18,185
you claimed that I was
a danger to Bajor;

236
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,647
that I was here
to destroy your people.

237
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,649
What I was really saying--

238
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:26,319
what I have always maintained--

239
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:29,948
is that you, Emissary, were
sent here by the Prophets

240
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:32,408
to challenge
our long-held beliefs.

241
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:35,620
Am I correct in assuming
that you no longer consider

242
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,080
the Federation to be
an enemy to Bajor?

243
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,334
Emissary, I admit,
I had some concerns

244
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:44,587
about Bajor's application
for Federation membership,

245
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:47,799
but now, I see
that the Federation's

246
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,968
presence here
is essential

247
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:53,053
for our long-term
security and growth.

248
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:56,599
Then, you support the notion
of Bajor joining the Federation?

249
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:59,811
If that is the will
of the Prophets,

250
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:02,689
I would never oppose it.

251
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,983
I'm glad you said that.

252
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:07,109
And I would be grateful

253
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,989
if you would tell it
to the Bajoran people.

254
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,492
Nothing could
make me happier

255
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,494
than to please
you, Emissary.

256
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,663
Perhaps you and I
could address

257
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,498
the Vedek Assembly
together

258
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:24,627
so everyone can celebrate
our new friendship.

259
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:26,880
An excellent idea.

260
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,632
Perhaps sometime next week.

261
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,926
Why wait,
Emissary?

262
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:35,137
I'm sure the Assembly would
grant us an immediate audience.

263
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,639
I'm sure
they would.

264
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:39,559
Unfortunately, if we were
to appear together

265
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:43,021
in public before the choosing,
it might be misconstrued

266
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:46,273
as an endorsement of your bid
to become the kai.

267
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,609
Oh, I doubt
that, Emissary.

268
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:52,112
It's common knowledge
that you support Vedek Bareil,

269
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:56,534
although I have been pleasantly
surprised that you haven't made

270
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,077
any public statement
to that effect.

271
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,579
The election of the kai

272
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,623
is strictly
an internal affair to Bajor.

273
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,793
As a Federation officer,
I would never interfere.

274
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,421
What an enlightened philosophy.

275
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,297
So then, it's agreed.

276
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:13,133
I'll be seeing you
sometime next week.

277
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,636
I look forward to it.

278
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:28,441
Odo to Major Kira.
This is Kira.

279
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,027
Sorry to disturb you, Major,
but I thought you should know

280
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,946
that Secretary Kubus
is about to leave for Bajor.

281
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,740
How can that be?

282
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,409
Vedek Winn has
granted him sanctuary.

283
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:39,619
I'll be right there.

284
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,580
Kira to Ops.
DAX:
Go ahead.

285
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,498
Dax, has Winn's ship
left the station?

286
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,209
Not yet. I was about to clear
them for departure.

287
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,211
Well, keep those docking clamps
locked on.

288
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,798
I don't want that ship going
anywhere until I say so.

289
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,633
Understood.

290
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,849
Tell me what happened.

291
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,311
Kubus requested
a private meeting

292
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,270
with Vedek Winn.

293
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,022
They talked for ten minutes

294
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:09,941
after which, Winn asked
for the use of my computer.

295
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:12,401
She accessed some
information from
the library system.

296
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,861
And?

297
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:17,156
And then she called the
provisional government

298
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,326
and informed them she was
granting Kubus sanctuary.

299
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,288
Do you know what she looked up?

300
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,125
I'm trying to find
that out right now.

301
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,299
Ah...

302
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,843
That's Prylar Bek.

303
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,761
Now, why would Winn
be interested

304
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:41,388
in another Bajoran
collaborator?

305
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,683
I'm not sure.

306
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,727
But Bek and Kubus
did know each other.

307
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,395
Bek was the liaison

308
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,606
between the Cardassians
and the Vedek Assembly

309
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,358
at the same time
that Kubus was secretary

310
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,110
to the occupational government.

311
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,863
They spent a lot
of time together
on the station.

312
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,238
Hold on a minute.

313
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,949
See if Winn accessed
any information

314
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:01,951
about the Kendra Valley
massacre.

315
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:05,830
You're right, she did.

316
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,707
Do you think Kubus told her

317
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,792
something new
about the massacre?

318
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,544
What else is
there to know?

319
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:14,172
Kai Opaka's son and 42 other
Bajoran freedom fighters

320
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:17,091
were ambushed and killed,
because Bek gave the Cardassians

321
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:18,676
the location
of their encampment.

322
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:21,512
He made a full confession
in his suicide note.

323
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:23,848
Well, you were
here then.

324
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,558
You must have
read it.

325
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,185
(<i> door opens</i> )

326
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:29,896
Major Kira, may I speak
to you, please?

327
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:32,065
Of course.

328
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,369
I was told you were the one

329
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,747
who stopped my
ship from leaving.

330
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,456
Yes, I did.

331
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,834
You know, you're
the last person I would expect

332
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,794
to help a collaborator
like Kubus,

333
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:56,630
unless, of course,
he has something you need.

334
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,926
My needs are no concern
of yours, child.

335
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,719
Now, I suggest

336
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:04,097
you allow my ship
to depart immediately.

337
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:09,936
Oh,<i> you're</i> free to leave
any time you like.

338
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:13,147
Unfortunately, in light of
public feelings about Kubus,

339
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:15,441
I can't allow
any ship with him on board

340
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,944
to leave the station
until it's undergone

341
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:19,319
a thorough security check.

342
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,072
To prevent sabotage.

343
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:22,740
And that includes

344
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,618
a molecular scan
for nanotechnology.

345
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,913
And how long
would such a scan take?

346
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,497
Oh, I'm no expert,

347
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:33,834
but I'm sure it could
take days... even weeks.

348
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:40,841
Very well.

349
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,971
It seems the Prophets
have decided

350
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:47,974
you will have a part
in this, after all.

351
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:53,271
In exchange for sanctuary,
Kubus has agreed to provide

352
00:21:53,271 --> 00:21:55,982
the name of the man
responsible for the massacre

353
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:57,608
at Kendra Valley.

354
00:21:57,608 --> 00:22:00,736
Prylar Bek was responsible
for the massacre.

355
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,071
Everyone knows that.

356
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,531
Bek was a pawn,
an intermediary.

357
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,284
He killed himself

358
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:08,744
to prevent the discovery
of the real traitor.

359
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,288
The real traitor?

360
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:11,705
Bek's superior--

361
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,083
the person
who ordered him to reveal

362
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:17,711
the location of the rebel base
to the Cardassians--

363
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:21,423
the man who was truly
responsible for the massacre--

364
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,967
Vedek Bareil.

365
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,687
Do you really think I'm going
to let you get away with this?

366
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:37,023
You know, no one's
going to believe

367
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:40,358
the word of a convicted
traitor like Kubus.

368
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:42,695
I never said I believed him.

369
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:47,200
I'm only trying to protect
the spiritual life of Bajor.

370
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,202
Don't flatter
yourself.

371
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:51,369
You're trying to grab
power, nothing more.

372
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:55,457
My child, do you want
to risk the consequences

373
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:58,836
of having a collaborator
as the next kai?

374
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:01,255
He is not a collaborator.

375
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:03,674
That's yet
to be determined.

376
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,509
But if he is chosen,

377
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,511
and turns out to be guilty,

378
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:11,849
the ramifications for Bajor
would be catastrophic.

379
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:15,061
It would shatter faith
in the authority of the kai,

380
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:20,440
and without a strong kai,
Bajor cannot survive.

381
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,737
You can't condemn
Bareil without proof.

382
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,155
I don't intend to.

383
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:29,533
I was planning to conduct
a quiet investigation

384
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,285
when I return to Bajor,

385
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:33,495
but I didn't know
whom to trust

386
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,497
with such
a delicate assignment

387
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,958
until now.

388
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:41,087
You want me to do your
dirty work for you.

389
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:43,256
All I care about
is the truth,

390
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:45,716
and I believe the Prophets
have chosen you

391
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,467
to help me find it.

392
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:50,428
I'll find out the truth.
Don't worry about that.

393
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:53,057
But I want you to keep
Kubus' accusations

394
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:54,767
from becoming public

395
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:57,561
until I have a chance to
prove Bareil's innocence.

396
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,479
You have my word.

397
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:02,566
Let the Prophets be my witness.

398
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,695
But if you discover proof
that he's guilty...

399
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,740
Whatever I find out,
I will share with you.

400
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:15,037
Then it's decided.

401
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:18,416
Oh, and, child, one last thing.

402
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:22,878
I know you're
under a terrible strain,

403
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,089
but if you're wise,

404
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:29,593
you will never speak to me
with such disrespect again.

405
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:46,319
Were you aware
at the time

406
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:48,486
that Prylar Bek was
a collaborator?
He wasn't a collaborator.

407
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:50,197
He was only a messenger

408
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,490
between the Cardassians
and the Vedek Assembly.

409
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,452
At the time, I could,
I could see

410
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:56,829
in the weeks
prior to the massacre

411
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,457
that something
was bothering him.

412
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:01,167
He was tense and nervous,

413
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:03,002
and he was in
constant communication

414
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,295
with the Vedek Assembly.

415
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:05,838
Do you know who?

416
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:08,299
Not at the time,
but the day after the incident,

417
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:11,344
Vedek Bareil came
to visit him at the station.

418
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:13,012
Did you see them
together?

419
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:15,264
I saw Bareil
enter Bek's quarters,

420
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,433
which were in the same section
as mine.

421
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:20,311
He was in there
for a couple of hours,
and at times,

422
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:22,688
I could hear shouting
through the bulkhead.

423
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,398
WINN:
Did you hear
what they were saying?

424
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:27,901
No, but I saw Bareil
when he left the station.

425
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,278
He was upset.

426
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:31,155
In the morning,

427
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:34,867
Bek hanged himself.

428
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,452
This...

429
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,162
is all the evidence
you have?

430
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:40,122
Well, isn't
that enough?

431
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:42,458
Bek was obviously
working with Bareil,

432
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:45,961
and when he realized
the enormity of what he'd done,

433
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,838
he must have wanted to confess.

434
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:49,507
Bareil wouldn't
allow it,

435
00:25:49,507 --> 00:25:52,051
so Bek took the
only way out he had.

436
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:55,346
That's a fascinating story,
but it is pure conjecture.

437
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:57,639
There have to be
a dozen explanations

438
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,726
for why Bareil came
to see Bek.

439
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,686
And it's up to you

440
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:05,439
to find out which of these
explanations is true.

441
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:11,111
What exactly is it
you're asking me, Nerys?

442
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:13,947
(<i> sighs</i> )

443
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:18,327
I guess I'm asking
whether or not

444
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:21,997
you came to the station
to see Bek that day.

445
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,374
I visited Bek, yes.

446
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:26,377
That hardly makes me
a collaborator.

447
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:27,961
I know that.

448
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,714
It's Vedek Winn
who needs convincing.

449
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,799
Oh, poor Winn.

450
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,178
Her desire to become kai
has clouded her judgment.

451
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:38,389
I wouldn't take
her so lightly,
if I were you.

452
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:40,433
She is determined to ruin you.

453
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:42,268
Believe me
when I tell you

454
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:44,019
there's no reason to worry.

455
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,855
I had nothing to do
with the massacre,

456
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:50,443
and Winn will never
be able to prove otherwise.

457
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:52,486
All right.

458
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:58,492
But... I still need to know
why you came to the station.

459
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:03,122
Bek was a deeply troubled man
seeking spiritual guidance.

460
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:06,750
His guilt at betraying
the Kendra Valley base

461
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,127
was overwhelming.

462
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:09,295
He called me
for help.

463
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:10,921
I came as soon
as I could.

464
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:12,965
I only wish I could have done
more for him.

465
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:15,384
What did he tell you
about the massacre?

466
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:17,261
Nerys, you must understand,

467
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:20,514
he was a monk speaking
in confidence to his Vedek.

468
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:22,349
I cannot betray that trust.

469
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,768
I understand.

470
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:29,064
Is there anything else you think
I should know about Bek,

471
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,816
about the
massacre?

472
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:32,859
Nothing that will satisfy Winn.

473
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:35,321
All right.

474
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:37,448
I'll keep looking,

475
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:39,492
but one way or another,

476
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:42,244
I am going to prove to Winn
that you are innocent.

477
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:44,871
Thank you, Nerys.

478
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,218
Ha, just as I thought.

479
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,761
When the Cardassians left

480
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:02,181
they purged all records
of communication

481
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:04,099
between the station and Bajor.

482
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:07,394
Then we'll just have
to get the information
from the other end.

483
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,104
I'll establish
a computer link

484
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,190
with the Bajoran
Central Archives.

485
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,233
That way, I can
access the files

486
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,485
of the Vedek Assembly.

487
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:25,663
Are you all right?

488
00:28:25,663 --> 00:28:27,206
I'm fine.

489
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:30,250
You don't
seem fine.

490
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,586
It's nothing.

491
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:34,380
Uh-huh.

492
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,298
If you say so.

493
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:39,426
He says he's not guilty.

494
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:42,346
I know he's not guilty.

495
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:44,056
But you're afraid he's guilty.

496
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:47,351
I love him, Odo.

497
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,980
Really?

498
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,943
Well, I, uh...

499
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:59,196
What?

500
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:00,989
I was just wondering

501
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:04,702
when you were going
to figure that out.

502
00:29:04,702 --> 00:29:06,286
You humanoids.

503
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:08,247
When it comes
to emotional
attachments,

504
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:09,956
you never see
the obvious.

505
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:13,043
Ah, I'm into
the Vedek Assembly files.

506
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:15,337
Can you retrieve
the communication files

507
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:17,839
between the station
and the Assembly?

508
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,841
I'll need a time frame.

509
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,553
Uh, try the week leading up
to the Kendra massacre.

510
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,307
That's odd.

511
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:29,560
What?

512
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,271
All the communications records
between the Assembly members

513
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:34,356
and Bek for that week
have been sealed.

514
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:35,774
Sealed? By who?
It doesn't say.

515
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,151
It just indicates
a security seal.

516
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,778
In the Assembly records?

517
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,114
Who has that kind of authority?

518
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,285
Only a Vedek.

519
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:58,046
QUARK:
One, two, three,

520
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,673
four, five,

521
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:02,217
six, seven,

522
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:06,346
eight, nine, ten.

523
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:09,266
Okay, okay.

524
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:12,436
Eleven...

525
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:15,314
Fine, 12, 13, 14.

526
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:17,107
(<i> giggling</i> )

527
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:19,401
And not a strip more.

528
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:21,320
I hate payday.

529
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,780
(<i> clears throat</i> )

530
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,367
Whatever she told you,
I didn't do it.

531
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:28,661
Relax, Quark.

532
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:31,413
No one's accusing you
of anything.

533
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:33,165
Eh, the day's
still young.

534
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:35,208
Don't be
so defensive.

535
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,376
I can't help it.

536
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,795
Between the two of you,

537
00:30:37,795 --> 00:30:40,255
I'm developing
a persecution complex.

538
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,090
KIRA:
I'm sorry
to hear that.

539
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,217
All right.

540
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,720
What's going on?

541
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:51,141
You want something from me,
don't you?

542
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:53,519
How did you guess?
It's simple.

543
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,228
We've been here
more than a minute,

544
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:57,272
and we haven't insulted him,
threatened him,

545
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,732
or arrested him.

546
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:00,108
Exactly.
So, what is it?

547
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:03,028
And how much trouble
is it going to cause me?

548
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:04,613
No trouble at all.

549
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:07,324
We just need you to
bypass a security seal.

550
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:09,909
Isn't that illegal?

551
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:11,203
Oh, spare us.

552
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,079
Quark, this
is important.

553
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,790
We need access to certain
communication files

554
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,709
in the Vedek
Assembly records.

555
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:19,169
Perfect-- not only is it
illegal, it's sacrilegious.

556
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:21,880
I'm sure the Prophets
won't mind just this once.

557
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,383
Okay, but I'm going
to have to have

558
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,760
written authorization from you,
countersigned by Commander...

559
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,387
Just do it, Quark!

560
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:30,556
Sure, when things go wrong,
I take the fall!

561
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:32,015
Nothing is going
to go wrong!

562
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,350
That's what you think!

563
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,268
But I happen to be
a firm believer

564
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,187
In Rule of Acquisition
Number 285:

565
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:39,356
"No good deed ever
goes unpunished."

566
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,151
You can access the
Vedek Assembly records

567
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,945
through the Bajoran
Central Archives.

568
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,614
Of course I can,

569
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:51,201
if I wanted to barge in
like some rank amateur.

570
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:58,625
This is going to take
a little while.

571
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:01,211
I'll let you know
when I'm done.

572
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,135
It happened
right about here.

573
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:12,431
Bek hanged himself in front
of dozens of witnesses.

574
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:13,807
Caused quite a stir.

575
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:15,601
At least he had
the decency

576
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:17,644
to feel guilty
about what he'd done.

577
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:18,937
Strange.

578
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,064
Bek and I were
passing acquaintances

579
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,315
here on the station.

580
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,067
From what little
I knew about him,

581
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,652
I always thought
he was a good man.

582
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:28,530
A good man does not betray
his own people.

583
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:31,991
The one thing
I've learned about humanoids

584
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:34,536
is that in extreme situations,

585
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:39,332
even the best of you are capable
of doing terrible things.

586
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,918
QUARK:
Hey.

587
00:32:40,918 --> 00:32:42,544
Hey, Odo.

588
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:47,132
The good news is

589
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,384
I broke through
the security seal.

590
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:52,095
The bad news is,
the file is empty.

591
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,681
All the messages
have been erased.

592
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:03,440
They're erased, all right.

593
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,400
Is there anything
you can do about it?

594
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,444
I could scan the
empty file for traces

595
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:08,946
of recurring
data fragments.

596
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:10,781
There's always
a faint residue

597
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:12,908
of the original data, if
you know where to look.

598
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:15,494
But to unscramble
those fragments

599
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:16,912
so they make a
coherent pattern

600
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:18,079
could take a while.

601
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,748
So what you're
telling me is

602
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:21,416
we're never going
to retrieve that information.

603
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,502
Well, not in time
to do you any good.

604
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:25,295
But hold on a second.

605
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:27,088
Let me see something.

606
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,090
I may not be able
to get you the data,

607
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,259
but I might be able to
find out who erased it.

608
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,928
Their retinal scan
would have been noted

609
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,054
by the authorization
subroutine when
they logged on.

610
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:38,057
But wouldn't the scans
have been erased, too?

611
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:40,727
Sure, but even a fragment
of the retinal scan

612
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,980
might be enough
to identify the user.

613
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,732
Here. I'll run a sweep
of the authorization subroutine,

614
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,901
see if we can find
out anything.

615
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:49,319
Okay.

616
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:51,864
These are
mathematical representations

617
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:53,949
of a fragment
of the retinal scan.

618
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:57,285
We can use these to reassemble
a portion of the original image.

619
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:00,163
Not bad.

620
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:02,123
Now we'll
cross-reference this

621
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,709
with the Assembly's
main archive,

622
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:06,252
see if we can find out
who it is.

623
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:17,347
I think we've got something.

624
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:31,904
ALL:
Blessings on Kai Bareil.

625
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:37,784
MAN:
You.

626
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:40,996
I trusted you.

627
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:43,498
I needed you.

628
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:46,334
And you let me die.

629
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,940
You will be rewarded.

630
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:21,494
Accept this gift
from the Prophets.

631
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:28,961
(<i> grunting</i> )

632
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:30,796
(<i> dagger scraping</i> )

633
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:45,769
May the Prophets
comfort you, my child.

634
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:47,980
May they comfort us all.

635
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:06,623
(<i> knocking</i> )

636
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:08,625
Come in.

637
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:14,840
Nerys.

638
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,510
Did you really believe
I wouldn't learn the truth?

639
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:23,222
The truth is not
always easy to recognize.

640
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:25,183
I recognize it now,

641
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,894
and I don't like what I see.

642
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,230
Why did you do it?

643
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,441
Why did you erase

644
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,360
those transmission records?

645
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,446
Don't make me do this.

646
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,448
I don't have any choice.

647
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:43,160
Winn is waiting to hear from me.

648
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,453
Do you really want me
to tell her

649
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,706
that you ordered Bek
to give the Cardassians

650
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,499
the location of that
resistance base?

651
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:52,002
That you are responsible

652
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:55,213
for the deaths
of those 43 people?

653
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,094
That you killed Kai Opaka's son?

654
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:13,523
The Cardassians were determined

655
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:17,235
to eliminate all resistance
in the Kendra Valley.

656
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:21,447
If someone hadn't told them
the location of that base,

657
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:25,577
they would have wiped out
every village in the area.

658
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:29,247
That would have meant the death
of 1,200 innocent Bajorans.

659
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:33,334
I could not allow that.

660
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:36,129
There had to have been
another way.

661
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:42,802
I believed in you.

662
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:46,514
I defended you,

663
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:49,601
and Winn was right all along.

664
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:55,648
And now she's going
to destroy you.

665
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,400
No.

666
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:01,780
I've destroyed myself.

667
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,335
What's our status?

668
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,255
Everything is
under control.

669
00:38:18,255 --> 00:38:20,506
You received
a subspace transmission

670
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:22,592
from Vedek Winn.

671
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:24,427
She seemed anxious
to talk to you.

672
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,721
Open a channel to
the Vedek Assembly.

673
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,181
Put it on monitor seven.

674
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:30,349
I might as well
get this over with.

675
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:37,356
I was wondering when
you'd contact me, child.

676
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:39,901
I was waiting to complete
my investigation.

677
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:41,444
I must
congratulate you

678
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,613
on a job well done.

679
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:46,699
I knew the Prophets were right
in picking you to assist me.

680
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,327
You sound like you already know
what I'm going to tell you.

681
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,829
Oh, but I do.

682
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:53,456
Bareil has just made
a surprise announcement

683
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,958
to the Vedek Assembly.

684
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,793
He's withdrawn himself
from the choosing.

685
00:38:56,793 --> 00:39:00,463
He no longer wishes
to be the next kai.

686
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,757
I know this is painful
for you, child,

687
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:06,011
but you've done a great service
for all of Bajor.

688
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:10,015
Whoever is chosen
tomorrow as the new kai

689
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:13,059
will owe you
a debt of gratitude.

690
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:15,561
May the Prophets guide you.

691
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,400
(<i> sighs</i> )

692
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,422
Are you all right?

693
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:44,716
It doesn't make sense.

694
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:46,759
Vedek Bareil is
an honorable man.

695
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:49,470
He wouldn't hide
from the consequences

696
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,472
of his actions
by covering them up.

697
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,933
I'm missing something.

698
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,476
Chief.

699
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:56,728
I need to get back

700
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,563
into the Vedek
Assembly archives.

701
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:00,606
Yes, sir.

702
00:40:46,236 --> 00:40:48,613
Kai Winn.

703
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:54,744
Your<i> pagh</i> is strong,
my child.

704
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:56,913
Be at peace.

705
00:40:56,913 --> 00:41:00,375
In time, you will learn
I am not your enemy.

706
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:03,002
I hope that's true.

707
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,546
I know you do.

708
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,799
Oh, and tell
Commander Sisko

709
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:12,095
I must postpone appearing
with him before the Assembly.

710
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:13,721
At least for now.

711
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:32,657
(<i> indistinct conversation</i> )

712
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:39,705
Nerys?

713
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:42,334
I didn't expect
to see you here.

714
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:45,628
You forgot to erase
the transit files.

715
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,715
I'm not sure I understand
what you mean.

716
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:53,511
Oh, you did a wonderful job
erasing the transmission reports

717
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:56,139
but you forgot
all about the transit files,

718
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:58,724
the files that prove
you weren't a collaborator.

719
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:03,396
It's over.

720
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:05,482
Let it rest.

721
00:42:05,482 --> 00:42:07,317
The people have chosen Winn.

722
00:42:07,317 --> 00:42:10,987
Only because you withdrew
and you didn't have to.

723
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:12,530
The transit reports clearly show

724
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,491
you were on a personal retreat

725
00:42:14,491 --> 00:42:16,951
at the Dakeen Monastery
during the week

726
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,453
leading up
to the massacre.

727
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:20,497
I checked the Dakeen
transmission reports.

728
00:42:20,497 --> 00:42:23,041
You had contact with no one

729
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:25,502
except one transmission
after the massacre

730
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:27,795
ordering you back
to the Vedek Assembly.

731
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,005
That's enough.

732
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:31,590
No, it is not enough.

733
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:35,345
There is no way
you ordered Bek

734
00:42:35,345 --> 00:42:39,265
to reveal the location of
the Kendra Valley encampment.

735
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,809
You were covering up
for someone else.

736
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:45,604
Someone who meant more
to you than me.

737
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:47,815
More to you even
than becoming kai.

738
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:50,735
Please, Nerys, don't.

739
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:51,861
Why not?

740
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:54,697
It's the truth, isn't it?

741
00:42:56,366 --> 00:42:59,452
Who else meant
that much to you?

742
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:01,620
It had to be Kai Opaka.

743
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,540
Opaka knew where

744
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:06,625
the resistance cell
was located...

745
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:11,423
because her son
was a member.

746
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:16,386
She was the collaborator,
wasn't she?

747
00:43:16,386 --> 00:43:20,765
She sacrificed her own son
to save 1,000 people.

748
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:24,643
I had to protect her.

749
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,650
So...

750
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:37,782
instead of you, we
have Winn to lead us.

751
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:40,452
It is the will
of the Prophets.

752
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:43,829
The question is...

753
00:43:45,582 --> 00:43:47,792
where will
she lead us?

754
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:52,422
Down paths she cannot
possibly imagine.

755
00:43:52,422 --> 00:43:55,633
She's going to need
our help along the way,

756
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,803
even if she doesn't
realize it yet.

757
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,889
What happens to us?

758
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:04,350
What do you want to happen?

759
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:15,903
(<i> sighs</i> )

760
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:19,698
Let's go pay our respects
to the new kai.
