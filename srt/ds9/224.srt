1
00:00:44,155 --> 00:00:45,681
Nerys?

2
00:00:45,726 --> 00:00:48,129
Vedek Bareil.

3
00:00:48,164 --> 00:00:49,793
Wanna play?

4
00:00:53,376 --> 00:00:54,503
Help me.

5
00:00:56,816 --> 00:00:58,376
Please.

6
00:01:00,424 --> 00:01:02,053
All right.

7
00:01:10,246 --> 00:01:11,909
Who is it?

8
00:01:16,025 --> 00:01:18,258
It's Prylar Bek.

9
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,890
No, it's not.

10
00:01:22,907 --> 00:01:24,376
It's you.

11
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,038
Good morning.

12
00:03:59,384 --> 00:04:01,981
I thought you'd sleep till noon.

13
00:04:04,095 --> 00:04:07,591
Shh... you're supposed
to be relaxing.

14
00:04:07,636 --> 00:04:10,437
Oh, I'm very relaxed.

15
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,603
Good.

16
00:04:12,647 --> 00:04:14,708
How are you feeling
this morning?

17
00:04:14,751 --> 00:04:16,618
Oh, miserable.

18
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:19,720
I wish you could
stay here longer.

19
00:04:19,762 --> 00:04:22,325
All right, I will.

20
00:04:22,367 --> 00:04:24,337
I'll stay a few more days.

21
00:04:24,372 --> 00:04:26,433
You know you can't do that.

22
00:04:26,476 --> 00:04:27,775
Why not?

23
00:04:27,813 --> 00:04:29,578
Because in two days

24
00:04:29,617 --> 00:04:32,487
you are going
to be elected kai.

25
00:04:32,524 --> 00:04:34,460
Hmm?

26
00:04:34,494 --> 00:04:36,396
Oh, that!

27
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:40,499
You know, there's no guarantee
I'm going to win.

28
00:04:40,574 --> 00:04:42,271
Of course, you're going to win.

29
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:44,805
The people need you.

30
00:04:48,559 --> 00:04:50,860
Are you...

31
00:04:50,898 --> 00:04:52,834
going to vote for me?

32
00:04:54,338 --> 00:04:56,137
Ho, ho!

33
00:04:56,175 --> 00:04:59,910
Is that why you spent
the last three days here, huh?

34
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:02,947
To get my vote?

35
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,892
Well, I know you don't agree

36
00:05:04,928 --> 00:05:07,627
with many of my views,
so I thought

37
00:05:07,668 --> 00:05:11,301
a personal appearance
might sway your opinion.

38
00:05:11,342 --> 00:05:15,113
I was going to vote
for Vedek Tolena.

39
00:05:19,427 --> 00:05:24,166
But I might be persuaded
to change my mind.

40
00:05:25,206 --> 00:05:27,108
Good.

41
00:05:27,143 --> 00:05:28,407
Because your vote

42
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:31,078
is the only one
that matters to me.

43
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,657
I may not always agree

44
00:05:36,698 --> 00:05:39,067
with your interpretations
of the prophecies

45
00:05:39,103 --> 00:05:43,340
but I think you will make
a wonderful kai.

46
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,974
Besides, everyone knows

47
00:05:45,017 --> 00:05:49,482
that you were Kai Opaka's
personal choice to succeed her.

48
00:05:54,504 --> 00:05:57,841
I could never replace Opaka.

49
00:05:57,878 --> 00:06:02,047
Bajor wouldn't have survived
the occupation without her.

50
00:06:02,087 --> 00:06:03,454
Once you become kai

51
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,257
we'll never have
these times together.

52
00:06:06,296 --> 00:06:07,491
Listen to me.

53
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:13,035
No matter how busy I become,
I will always have time for you.

54
00:06:13,078 --> 00:06:14,547
It won't be easy.

55
00:06:14,581 --> 00:06:17,382
I didn't say it would be.

56
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,791
I'm not going to lose you,
Nerys.

57
00:06:20,828 --> 00:06:23,322
I promise you that.

58
00:06:28,377 --> 00:06:31,213
Remember now,
honor the Prophets

59
00:06:31,251 --> 00:06:33,950
and they will always love you.

60
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,325
As I understand the sacred texts

61
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:39,061
the Prophets' love
is unconditional.

62
00:06:39,101 --> 00:06:41,470
They ask nothing in return.

63
00:06:41,507 --> 00:06:44,810
Thank you, Vedek Bareil,
for reminding us

64
00:06:44,847 --> 00:06:48,130
how the sacred text can be
so easily misinterpreted.

65
00:06:48,263 --> 00:06:51,030
Nothing pleases me more
than providing you

66
00:06:51,137 --> 00:06:52,970
with an opposing viewpoint,
Vedek Winn.

67
00:06:53,007 --> 00:06:56,174
Somehow you never
fail to do that.

68
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:58,948
I had no idea you
were on the station

69
00:06:58,987 --> 00:07:02,085
but perhaps I shouldn't
be so surprised.

70
00:07:02,127 --> 00:07:04,690
Oh, I wouldn't even
try to surprise you.

71
00:07:04,733 --> 00:07:07,569
I understand you've
been keeping a close eye

72
00:07:07,607 --> 00:07:10,010
on my activities
these last few weeks.

73
00:07:10,078 --> 00:07:13,745
The eyes of all of Bajor
are focused on you, Bareil.

74
00:07:13,786 --> 00:07:15,950
Why should I be any different?

75
00:07:15,992 --> 00:07:18,225
After all, the common wisdom

76
00:07:18,263 --> 00:07:21,703
is that you are destined
to be the next kai.

77
00:07:21,737 --> 00:07:23,536
Was that a concession speech?

78
00:07:23,575 --> 00:07:24,668
Hardly.

79
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,614
The choosing is still
two days away.

80
00:07:27,651 --> 00:07:30,647
The Prophets may yet
surprise us all.

81
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,523
Remember that, Bareil.

82
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,897
I would hate for you to start
celebrating prematurely.

83
00:07:35,934 --> 00:07:39,396
What brings you to the station,
Vedek Winn?

84
00:07:39,443 --> 00:07:41,345
My child, if I thought
the Prophets

85
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,715
wanted you to know
the purpose of my visit

86
00:07:43,752 --> 00:07:46,087
I would have informed you
of it in advance.

87
00:07:46,191 --> 00:07:49,061
Well, now that I know
you're here, I'll be sure

88
00:07:49,097 --> 00:07:52,366
to inform Constable Odo
to increase station security.

89
00:07:52,404 --> 00:07:54,101
That won't be necessary.

90
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,905
I feel quite safe here.

91
00:07:55,945 --> 00:07:59,112
No, it wasn't your safety
that concerned me.

92
00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:02,386
Just what are you trying
to infer, child?

93
00:08:02,426 --> 00:08:06,868
I'm sure Major Kira meant
no disrespect.

94
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,064
No, not at all.

95
00:08:08,106 --> 00:08:10,634
I just want to avoid
the violence

96
00:08:10,678 --> 00:08:13,582
that occurred
during your last visit.

97
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:17,423
My child, I know
you still hold me responsible

98
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:21,525
for the deplorable attempt
on Vedek Bareil's life

99
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:24,005
but I can only pray
that some day

100
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,004
you will be cured of
this unfortunate misconception.

101
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,885
Well, that's one prayer
that will never be answered.

102
00:08:30,922 --> 00:08:34,054
What a pity, for both of us.

103
00:08:37,537 --> 00:08:38,505
Ooh!

104
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,533
Oh! Excuse me.

105
00:08:52,703 --> 00:08:53,864
Uh, excuse me.

106
00:08:53,906 --> 00:08:55,341
Don't I know you?

107
00:08:55,376 --> 00:08:57,107
You must be mistaken.

108
00:08:57,147 --> 00:08:59,174
No, no, I've seen you before.

109
00:08:59,218 --> 00:09:02,316
You're... Kubus, that's it.

110
00:09:02,358 --> 00:09:03,725
Kubus Oak.

111
00:09:03,761 --> 00:09:05,594
You worked for the Cardassians.

112
00:09:05,632 --> 00:09:07,033
Out of my way!

113
00:09:07,069 --> 00:09:09,233
Now, you wait a minute!

114
00:09:09,273 --> 00:09:11,506
You're not going anywhere.

115
00:09:11,545 --> 00:09:15,144
I know who you are,
and I know what you did!

116
00:09:15,219 --> 00:09:17,086
You're a traitor!

117
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:18,991
This is Kubus Oak!

118
00:09:19,028 --> 00:09:20,520
He's a traitor!

119
00:09:20,565 --> 00:09:23,936
He worked for the Cardassians!

120
00:09:23,972 --> 00:09:25,601
What's going on here?

121
00:09:25,643 --> 00:09:27,169
See for yourself.

122
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,521
Secretary Kubus.

123
00:09:31,556 --> 00:09:34,586
Last I heard, you were living
on Cardassia.

124
00:09:34,629 --> 00:09:37,157
I decided it was time
to come home.

125
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,795
Welcome back.

126
00:09:38,838 --> 00:09:40,501
You're under arrest.

127
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:04,120
The Prophets have spoken.

128
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,461
All blessings on the new Kai.

129
00:10:06,499 --> 00:10:08,936
Blessings on the Kai.

130
00:10:08,971 --> 00:10:11,340
May the Prophets guide you.

131
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:22,895
Kai Opaka.

132
00:10:28,748 --> 00:10:31,846
Be at peace, my child.

133
00:10:31,888 --> 00:10:35,693
You must be strong,
now more than ever.

134
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,497
Why did you leave us?

135
00:10:38,536 --> 00:10:41,600
All is as the Prophets
will it to be

136
00:10:41,643 --> 00:10:43,910
as you will learn.

137
00:10:45,652 --> 00:10:47,349
Follow me.

138
00:10:47,422 --> 00:10:49,916
Be careful, Bareil.

139
00:10:49,961 --> 00:10:52,831
The path she walks
is a narrow one.

140
00:10:52,868 --> 00:10:55,101
See that you don't stumble.

141
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:57,006
Heed her words.

142
00:10:57,044 --> 00:11:00,779
But I don't deserve
to walk in your path.

143
00:11:00,818 --> 00:11:02,117
You must.

144
00:11:02,155 --> 00:11:04,022
It is your destiny.

145
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,319
Prylar Bek?

146
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:24,968
Accept this gift
from the Prophets.

147
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:39,131
You must not refuse
their offering.

148
00:11:42,376 --> 00:11:43,970
Take it, my child.

149
00:11:44,013 --> 00:11:45,812
Its venom
will make you stronger.

150
00:12:12,518 --> 00:12:15,582
There was quite a mob
gathering out there.

151
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:19,896
I had to call in extra security
to disperse it.

152
00:12:19,935 --> 00:12:24,343
I never doubted your ability
to handle the situation, Odo.

153
00:12:24,378 --> 00:12:26,872
You always were good
at your job.

154
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:31,655
I could say the same for you,
Secretary Kubus...

155
00:12:31,694 --> 00:12:35,134
special liaison between
the Cardassian occupation forces

156
00:12:35,168 --> 00:12:37,731
and their pawns
in the Bajoran government.

157
00:12:37,774 --> 00:12:40,143
I served the only
recognized government

158
00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:42,081
on Bajor during the occupation.

159
00:12:42,116 --> 00:12:44,451
Recognized by the Cardassians.

160
00:12:44,488 --> 00:12:47,484
If it wasn't for us,
the situation on Bajor

161
00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:50,627
would have been ten times
worse than it was.

162
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:52,970
Maybe, but I don't see
how you could know that

163
00:12:53,007 --> 00:12:56,242
seeing that you spent nearly all
your time here on the station.

164
00:12:56,281 --> 00:12:59,379
I remember Gul Dukat
telling me once

165
00:12:59,421 --> 00:13:01,585
that you were
his favorite Bajoran.

166
00:13:01,626 --> 00:13:05,965
Really? Well, I never could
stand that arrogant tyrant!

167
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:08,166
You hid your feelings well.

168
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,475
It kept me alive.

169
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,446
Bajor is my home.

170
00:13:17,661 --> 00:13:19,654
I never should have left it.

171
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:22,500
But you did...

172
00:13:22,539 --> 00:13:25,238
and you're going to have
to live with that decision.

173
00:13:26,915 --> 00:13:29,113
This is Major Kira

174
00:13:29,154 --> 00:13:31,955
the highest-ranking Bajoran
on the station.

175
00:13:31,993 --> 00:13:34,430
Then I suppose you're the one
I should be talking to.

176
00:13:34,465 --> 00:13:35,626
Make it brief.

177
00:13:35,668 --> 00:13:38,333
I don't enjoy
talking to collaborators.

178
00:13:38,374 --> 00:13:40,435
I'm not asking you to like me.

179
00:13:40,478 --> 00:13:43,041
I'm simply requesting that I be
allowed to return home.

180
00:13:43,151 --> 00:13:44,450
Your request is denied.

181
00:13:44,487 --> 00:13:47,824
I doubt if you have the
authority to make that decision.

182
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:50,298
The decision has
already been made.

183
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:54,172
In the Ilvian Proclamation,
every Bajoran who was a member

184
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:56,339
of the Cardassian
occupational government

185
00:13:56,379 --> 00:13:58,509
was sentenced to exile.

186
00:13:58,551 --> 00:14:02,150
Your name was number four
on that list.

187
00:14:02,192 --> 00:14:06,156
Personally, I think
you all got off too easy.

188
00:14:09,575 --> 00:14:11,306
Major...

189
00:14:11,346 --> 00:14:13,248
I'm an old man.

190
00:14:13,284 --> 00:14:15,186
I don't have many years left.

191
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,490
What's the harm of letting me
live them out on Bajor?

192
00:14:18,528 --> 00:14:20,555
When the Cardassians needed

193
00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:23,902
a new group of Bajorans
to work in the mines

194
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,810
who approved those work orders?

195
00:14:26,847 --> 00:14:29,045
The Bajoran government.

196
00:14:29,085 --> 00:14:32,525
Whose signature was
on those authorization forms?

197
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:36,257
Mine.

198
00:14:36,301 --> 00:14:37,600
And you had to know

199
00:14:37,637 --> 00:14:39,436
that those authorizations
were death sentences.

200
00:14:39,474 --> 00:14:43,073
Did you ever once refuse
to sign them?

201
00:14:44,752 --> 00:14:46,221
No.

202
00:14:47,326 --> 00:14:50,356
And that's why
you can never be allowed

203
00:14:50,398 --> 00:14:52,528
to set foot on Bajor again.

204
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:55,371
Because, if you do,
it would dishonor

205
00:14:55,409 --> 00:14:59,316
the memory of every person
you sentenced to death.

206
00:15:18,427 --> 00:15:19,520
Vedek Winn.

207
00:15:19,562 --> 00:15:21,395
What can I do for you?

208
00:15:21,433 --> 00:15:24,497
Emissary...

209
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,034
it has recently come
to my attention

210
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:29,915
that there are
some on Bajor who believe

211
00:15:29,952 --> 00:15:33,859
that my relationship with you
is not all it should be.

212
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:36,967
Really?

213
00:15:37,001 --> 00:15:38,493
Personally, I find

214
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:40,975
such a perception,
however inaccurate

215
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,570
to be most distressing.

216
00:15:42,613 --> 00:15:45,950
I suppose the question
we have to ask ourselves

217
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:49,051
is whether or not
that perception is inaccurate.

218
00:15:49,094 --> 00:15:52,363
Don't tell me
that you yourself, Emissary

219
00:15:52,402 --> 00:15:55,637
believe that you and I are...

220
00:15:55,675 --> 00:15:57,771
how shall I put it?

221
00:15:57,813 --> 00:15:59,612
Enemies?

222
00:16:00,652 --> 00:16:02,554
At odds.

223
00:16:02,591 --> 00:16:05,689
Well...

224
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,860
let's see.

225
00:16:07,902 --> 00:16:11,535
How could I have come
to such a conclusion?

226
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,845
Maybe it has something
to do with the fact

227
00:16:14,884 --> 00:16:16,945
that the last time
you were here at this station

228
00:16:16,989 --> 00:16:19,392
you claimed that I was
a danger to Bajor;

229
00:16:19,427 --> 00:16:21,762
that I was here
to destroy your people.

230
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:23,701
What I was really saying...

231
00:16:23,737 --> 00:16:27,576
what I have always maintained...

232
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:31,211
is that you, Emissary, were
sent here by the Prophets

233
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,723
to challenge
our long-held beliefs.

234
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,960
Am I correct in assuming
that you no longer consider

235
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:39,402
the Federation to be
an enemy to Bajor?

236
00:16:39,438 --> 00:16:41,966
Emissary, I admit
I had some concerns

237
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:45,849
about Bajor's application
for Federation membership

238
00:16:45,886 --> 00:16:49,189
but now, I see
that the Federation's

239
00:16:49,226 --> 00:16:51,253
presence here is essential

240
00:16:51,297 --> 00:16:54,270
for our long-term
security and growth.

241
00:16:54,371 --> 00:16:58,004
Then, you support the notion
of Bajor joining the Federation?

242
00:16:58,045 --> 00:17:01,109
If that is the will
of the Prophets

243
00:17:01,152 --> 00:17:02,883
I would never oppose it.

244
00:17:04,025 --> 00:17:06,189
I'm glad you said that.

245
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,394
And I would be grateful

246
00:17:08,435 --> 00:17:12,206
if you would tell it
to the Bajoran people.

247
00:17:13,947 --> 00:17:17,911
Nothing could make me happier
than to please you, Emissary.

248
00:17:17,956 --> 00:17:21,920
Perhaps you and I could address
the Vedek Assembly together

249
00:17:21,965 --> 00:17:25,736
so everyone can celebrate
our new friendship.

250
00:17:25,773 --> 00:17:28,176
An excellent idea.

251
00:17:28,211 --> 00:17:31,047
Perhaps sometime next week.

252
00:17:31,085 --> 00:17:33,283
Why wait, Emissary?

253
00:17:33,322 --> 00:17:36,420
I'm sure the Assembly would
grant us an immediate audience.

254
00:17:36,463 --> 00:17:37,864
I'm sure they would.

255
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,770
Unfortunately, if we were
to appear together

256
00:17:40,806 --> 00:17:44,302
in public before the choosing,
it might be misconstrued

257
00:17:44,414 --> 00:17:47,581
as an endorsement of your bid
to become the kai.

258
00:17:47,621 --> 00:17:50,184
Oh, I doubt that, Emissary.

259
00:17:50,227 --> 00:17:53,428
It's common knowledge
that you support Vedek Bareil

260
00:17:53,468 --> 00:17:57,739
although I have been pleasantly
surprised that you haven't made

261
00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:59,337
any public statement
to that effect.

262
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,849
The election of the kai

263
00:18:00,884 --> 00:18:03,754
is strictly
an internal affair to Bajor.

264
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:07,230
As a Federation officer,
I would never interfere.

265
00:18:07,264 --> 00:18:09,929
What an enlightened philosophy.

266
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:11,599
So then, it's agreed.

267
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,613
I'll be seeing you
sometime next week.

268
00:18:14,647 --> 00:18:16,743
I look forward to it.

269
00:18:25,507 --> 00:18:27,374
Odo to Major Kira.

270
00:18:27,411 --> 00:18:28,436
This is Kira.

271
00:18:28,481 --> 00:18:30,314
Sorry to disturb you, Major

272
00:18:30,351 --> 00:18:31,512
but I thought you should know

273
00:18:31,554 --> 00:18:33,490
that Secretary Kubus
about to leave for Bajor.

274
00:18:35,162 --> 00:18:36,631
How can that be?

275
00:18:36,665 --> 00:18:39,136
Vedek Winn has
granted him sanctuary.

276
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,537
I'll be right there.

277
00:18:40,574 --> 00:18:42,441
Kira to Ops.

278
00:18:42,477 --> 00:18:43,536
Go ahead.

279
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:45,244
Dax, has Winn's ship
left the station?

280
00:18:45,284 --> 00:18:46,411
Not yet.

281
00:18:46,453 --> 00:18:47,979
I was about to clear them
for departure.

282
00:18:48,023 --> 00:18:50,016
Well, keep those docking clamps
locked on.

283
00:18:50,061 --> 00:18:52,624
I don't want that ship going
anywhere until I say so.

284
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:54,261
Understood.

285
00:19:01,353 --> 00:19:02,788
Tell me what happened.

286
00:19:04,025 --> 00:19:06,964
Kubus requested a private
meeting with Vedek Winn.

287
00:19:06,999 --> 00:19:08,298
They talked for ten minutes

288
00:19:08,334 --> 00:19:10,828
after which, Winn asked
for the use of my computer.

289
00:19:10,873 --> 00:19:13,640
She accessed some information
from the library system.

290
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,944
And?

291
00:19:14,982 --> 00:19:17,955
And then she called
the provisional government

292
00:19:17,989 --> 00:19:21,326
and informed them she was
granting Kubus sanctuary.

293
00:19:23,367 --> 00:19:25,428
Do you know what she looked up?

294
00:19:25,472 --> 00:19:28,502
I'm trying to find
that out right now.

295
00:19:34,325 --> 00:19:36,022
Ah...

296
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,464
That's Prylar Bek.

297
00:19:37,498 --> 00:19:39,594
Now, why would Winn
be interested

298
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:42,108
in another Bajoran collaborator?

299
00:19:42,142 --> 00:19:44,409
I'm not sure.

300
00:19:44,448 --> 00:19:47,512
But Bek and Kubus
did know each other.

301
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:48,613
Bek was the liaison

302
00:19:48,657 --> 00:19:51,254
between the Cardassians
and the Vedek Assembly

303
00:19:51,296 --> 00:19:53,597
at the same time
that Kubus was secretary

304
00:19:53,634 --> 00:19:54,933
to the occupational government.

305
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:57,703
They spent a lot of time
together on the station.

306
00:19:57,744 --> 00:19:58,712
Hold on a minute.

307
00:19:58,746 --> 00:20:00,807
See if Winn accessed
any information

308
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,752
about the Kendra Valley
massacre.

309
00:20:05,327 --> 00:20:06,694
You're right, she did.

310
00:20:06,729 --> 00:20:08,460
Do you think Kubus told her

311
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,561
something new
about the massacre?

312
00:20:10,605 --> 00:20:12,268
What else is there to know?

313
00:20:12,308 --> 00:20:14,973
Kai Opaka's son and 42 other
Bajoran freedom fighters

314
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,986
were ambushed and killed,
because Bek gave the Cardassians

315
00:20:18,021 --> 00:20:19,650
the location
of their encampment.

316
00:20:19,691 --> 00:20:22,595
He made a full confession
in his suicide note.

317
00:20:22,631 --> 00:20:24,533
Well, you were here then.

318
00:20:24,569 --> 00:20:26,300
You must have read it.

319
00:20:27,408 --> 00:20:30,973
Major Kira, may I speak
to you, please?

320
00:20:31,016 --> 00:20:32,986
Of course.

321
00:20:44,546 --> 00:20:46,243
I was told you were the one

322
00:20:46,283 --> 00:20:48,447
who stopped
my ship from leaving.

323
00:20:48,487 --> 00:20:49,956
Yes, I did.

324
00:20:49,991 --> 00:20:52,758
You know, you're
the last person I would expect

325
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:54,734
to help a collaborator
like Kubus

326
00:20:54,768 --> 00:20:57,467
unless, of course,
he has something you need.

327
00:20:57,507 --> 00:21:00,969
My needs are no concern
of yours, child.

328
00:21:01,015 --> 00:21:02,541
Now, I suggest

329
00:21:02,585 --> 00:21:05,352
you allow my ship
to depart immediately.

330
00:21:07,596 --> 00:21:10,660
Oh, you're free to leave
anytime you like.

331
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:14,040
Unfortunately, in light
of public feelings about Kubus

332
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,275
I can't allow
any ship with him on board

333
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,617
to leave the station
until it's undergone

334
00:21:18,655 --> 00:21:20,056
a thorough security check.

335
00:21:20,124 --> 00:21:21,923
To prevent sabotage.

336
00:21:21,962 --> 00:21:23,488
And that includes

337
00:21:23,531 --> 00:21:26,834
a molecular scan
for nanotechnology.

338
00:21:26,872 --> 00:21:29,639
And how long
would such a scan take?

339
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,012
Oh, I'm no expert

340
00:21:31,048 --> 00:21:35,149
but I'm sure it could
take days... even weeks.

341
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,536
Very well.

342
00:21:43,542 --> 00:21:45,877
It seems the Prophets
have decided

343
00:21:45,914 --> 00:21:48,647
you will have a part
in this, after all.

344
00:21:50,691 --> 00:21:54,131
In exchange for sanctuary,
Kubus has agreed to provide

345
00:21:54,165 --> 00:21:57,138
the name of the man
responsible for the massacre

346
00:21:57,239 --> 00:21:58,468
at Kendra Valley.

347
00:21:58,508 --> 00:22:01,481
Prylar Bek was responsible
for the massacre.

348
00:22:01,515 --> 00:22:02,916
Everyone knows that.

349
00:22:02,952 --> 00:22:05,253
Bek was a pawn,
an intermediary.

350
00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:06,553
He killed himself

351
00:22:06,593 --> 00:22:09,930
to prevent the discovery
of the real traitor.

352
00:22:09,967 --> 00:22:11,402
The real traitor?

353
00:22:11,437 --> 00:22:12,736
Bek's superior...

354
00:22:12,773 --> 00:22:15,244
the person
who ordered him to reveal

355
00:22:15,278 --> 00:22:18,740
the location of the rebel base
to the Cardassians...

356
00:22:18,787 --> 00:22:22,488
the man who was truly
responsible for the massacre...

357
00:22:22,528 --> 00:22:24,122
Vedek Bareil.

358
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:36,791
Do you really think I'm going
to let you get away with this?

359
00:22:36,826 --> 00:22:39,024
You know, no one's
going to believe

360
00:22:39,064 --> 00:22:41,627
the word of a convicted
traitor like Kubus.

361
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:44,005
I never said I believed him.

362
00:22:44,042 --> 00:22:48,609
I'm only trying to protect
the spiritual life of Bajor.

363
00:22:48,651 --> 00:22:50,416
Don't flatter yourself.

364
00:22:50,456 --> 00:22:52,689
You're trying to grab power,
nothing more.

365
00:22:52,727 --> 00:22:56,532
My child, do you want
to risk the consequences

366
00:22:56,569 --> 00:23:00,031
of having a collaborator
as the next kai?

367
00:23:00,077 --> 00:23:02,412
He is not a collaborator.

368
00:23:02,449 --> 00:23:04,818
That's yet to be determined.

369
00:23:04,854 --> 00:23:08,795
But if he is chosen
and turns out to be guilty

370
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:13,101
the ramifications for Bajor
would be catastrophic.

371
00:23:13,139 --> 00:23:16,408
It would shatter faith
in the authority of the kai

372
00:23:16,446 --> 00:23:21,754
and without a strong kai,
Bajor cannot survive.

373
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:25,926
You can't condemn
Bareil without proof.

374
00:23:25,967 --> 00:23:27,196
I don't intend to.

375
00:23:27,304 --> 00:23:30,744
I was planning to conduct
a quiet investigation

376
00:23:30,778 --> 00:23:32,407
when I return to Bajor

377
00:23:32,448 --> 00:23:34,544
but I didn't know
whom to trust

378
00:23:34,586 --> 00:23:36,716
with such
a delicate assignment...

379
00:23:36,757 --> 00:23:39,194
until now.

380
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:42,226
You want me to do
your dirty work for you.

381
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,366
All I care about is the truth

382
00:23:44,407 --> 00:23:47,243
and I believe the Prophets
have chosen you

383
00:23:47,281 --> 00:23:48,614
to help me find it.

384
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:51,623
I'll find out the truth.
Don't worry about that.

385
00:23:51,657 --> 00:23:54,185
But I want you to keep
Kubus' accusations

386
00:23:54,229 --> 00:23:55,562
from becoming public

387
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:58,800
until I have a chance
to prove Bareil's innocence.

388
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,537
You have my word.

389
00:24:00,577 --> 00:24:03,744
Let the Prophets be my witness.

390
00:24:05,688 --> 00:24:07,955
But if you discover proof
that he's guilty...

391
00:24:07,993 --> 00:24:10,897
Whatever I find out,
I will share with you.

392
00:24:13,171 --> 00:24:16,144
Then it's decided.

393
00:24:16,177 --> 00:24:19,708
Oh, and, child, one last thing.

394
00:24:19,752 --> 00:24:24,057
I know you're
under a terrible strain

395
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:26,225
but if you're wise

396
00:24:26,266 --> 00:24:31,209
you will never speak to me
with such disrespect again.

397
00:24:45,255 --> 00:24:46,314
Were you aware at the time

398
00:24:46,357 --> 00:24:47,724
that Prylar Bek was
a collaborator?

399
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,853
He wasn't a collaborator.

400
00:24:48,897 --> 00:24:50,092
He was only a messenger

401
00:24:50,132 --> 00:24:53,401
between the Cardassians
and the Vedek Assembly.

402
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,171
At the time, I could,
I could see

403
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:57,681
in the weeks
prior to the massacre

404
00:24:57,716 --> 00:25:00,085
that something
was bothering him.

405
00:25:00,121 --> 00:25:01,886
He was tense and nervous

406
00:25:01,925 --> 00:25:03,656
and he was in
constant communication

407
00:25:03,695 --> 00:25:04,822
with the Vedek Assembly.

408
00:25:04,932 --> 00:25:06,025
Do you know who?

409
00:25:06,067 --> 00:25:07,035
Not at the time

410
00:25:07,069 --> 00:25:09,005
but the day after the incident

411
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:12,014
Vedek Bareil came
to visit him at the station.

412
00:25:12,047 --> 00:25:13,744
Did you see them together?

413
00:25:13,784 --> 00:25:15,948
I saw Bareil
enter Bek's quarters

414
00:25:15,989 --> 00:25:18,085
which were in the same section
as mine.

415
00:25:18,128 --> 00:25:20,098
He was in there
for a couple of hours

416
00:25:20,132 --> 00:25:21,361
and at times

417
00:25:21,401 --> 00:25:23,497
I could hear shouting
through the bulkhead.

418
00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:25,304
Did you hear
what they were saying?

419
00:25:25,343 --> 00:25:28,839
No, but I saw Bareil
when he left the station.

420
00:25:28,884 --> 00:25:30,353
He was upset.

421
00:25:30,387 --> 00:25:35,797
In the morning,
Bek hanged himself.

422
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:37,496
This...

423
00:25:37,537 --> 00:25:39,302
is all the evidence you have?

424
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,037
Well, isn't that enough?

425
00:25:41,078 --> 00:25:43,606
Bek was obviously
working with Bareil

426
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:46,885
and when he realized
the enormity of what he'd done

427
00:25:46,924 --> 00:25:48,917
he must have wanted to confess.

428
00:25:48,962 --> 00:25:50,556
Bareil wouldn't allow it

429
00:25:50,598 --> 00:25:53,092
so Bek took the only way out
he had.

430
00:25:53,138 --> 00:25:56,475
That's a fascinating story,
but it is pure conjecture.

431
00:25:56,512 --> 00:25:58,745
There have to be
a dozen explanations

432
00:25:58,783 --> 00:26:01,779
for why Bareil
came to see Bek.

433
00:26:01,823 --> 00:26:03,122
And it's up to you

434
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,224
to find out which of these
explanations is true.

435
00:26:08,471 --> 00:26:12,104
What exactly is it
you're asking me, Nerys?

436
00:26:16,455 --> 00:26:19,222
I guess I'm asking
whether or not

437
00:26:19,262 --> 00:26:23,067
you came to the station
to see Bek that day.

438
00:26:23,103 --> 00:26:24,595
I visited Bek, yes.

439
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,579
That hardly makes me
a collaborator.

440
00:26:27,613 --> 00:26:28,774
I know that.

441
00:26:28,815 --> 00:26:31,845
It's Vedek Winn
who needs convincing.

442
00:26:31,889 --> 00:26:33,586
Oh, poor Winn.

443
00:26:33,626 --> 00:26:37,590
Her desire to become kai
has clouded her judgment.

444
00:26:37,635 --> 00:26:39,605
I wouldn't take her so lightly,
if I were you.

445
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:41,632
She is determined to ruin you.

446
00:26:41,678 --> 00:26:45,379
Believe me when I tell you
there's no reason to worry.

447
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:47,982
I had nothing to do
with the massacre

448
00:26:48,091 --> 00:26:51,496
and Winn will never
be able to prove otherwise.

449
00:26:51,533 --> 00:26:53,400
All right.

450
00:26:53,437 --> 00:26:59,644
But... I still need to know
why you came to the station.

451
00:26:59,683 --> 00:27:04,422
Bek was a deeply troubled man
seeking spiritual guidance.

452
00:27:04,461 --> 00:27:07,866
His guilt at betraying
the Kendra Valley base

453
00:27:07,901 --> 00:27:09,200
was overwhelming.

454
00:27:09,238 --> 00:27:10,502
He called me for help.

455
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,066
I came as soon as I could.

456
00:27:12,111 --> 00:27:14,104
I only wish I could have done
more for him.

457
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:16,586
What did he tell you
about the massacre?

458
00:27:16,621 --> 00:27:18,352
Nerys, you must understand

459
00:27:18,392 --> 00:27:21,695
he was a monk speaking
in confidence to his Vedek.

460
00:27:21,732 --> 00:27:23,565
I cannot betray that trust.

461
00:27:23,603 --> 00:27:25,904
I understand.

462
00:27:25,941 --> 00:27:30,212
Is there anything else you think
I should know about Bek

463
00:27:30,251 --> 00:27:31,914
about the massacre?

464
00:27:31,954 --> 00:27:33,981
Nothing that will satisfy Winn.

465
00:27:34,025 --> 00:27:36,588
All right.

466
00:27:36,632 --> 00:27:38,659
I'll keep looking

467
00:27:38,703 --> 00:27:40,138
but one way or another

468
00:27:40,173 --> 00:27:43,510
I am going to prove to Winn
that you are innocent.

469
00:27:43,547 --> 00:27:45,984
Thank you, Nerys.

470
00:27:57,611 --> 00:27:59,513
Ha, just as I thought.

471
00:27:59,548 --> 00:28:01,017
When the Cardassians left

472
00:28:01,052 --> 00:28:03,421
they purged all records
of communication

473
00:28:03,457 --> 00:28:05,222
between the station and Bajor.

474
00:28:05,261 --> 00:28:07,391
Then we'll just have
to get the information

475
00:28:07,432 --> 00:28:08,696
from the other end.

476
00:28:08,735 --> 00:28:10,432
I'll establish a computer link

477
00:28:10,472 --> 00:28:12,442
with the Bajoran
Central Archives.

478
00:28:12,477 --> 00:28:15,644
That way, I can access the files
of the Vedek Assembly.

479
00:28:25,505 --> 00:28:26,872
Are you all right?

480
00:28:26,909 --> 00:28:28,378
I'm fine.

481
00:28:28,412 --> 00:28:31,544
You don't seem fine.

482
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:33,749
It's nothing.

483
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,419
Uh-huh.

484
00:28:35,461 --> 00:28:37,363
If you say so.

485
00:28:37,398 --> 00:28:40,462
He says he's not guilty.

486
00:28:40,505 --> 00:28:43,478
I know he's not guilty.

487
00:28:43,512 --> 00:28:45,141
But you're afraid he's guilty.

488
00:28:46,752 --> 00:28:48,585
I love him, Odo.

489
00:28:51,095 --> 00:28:53,088
Really?

490
00:28:54,536 --> 00:28:58,101
Well, I, uh...

491
00:28:58,143 --> 00:29:00,307
What?

492
00:29:00,349 --> 00:29:02,216
I was just wondering

493
00:29:02,253 --> 00:29:05,852
when you were going
to figure that out.

494
00:29:05,895 --> 00:29:07,455
You humanoids.

495
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:09,364
When it comes
to emotional attachments

496
00:29:09,402 --> 00:29:11,099
you never see the obvious.

497
00:29:11,206 --> 00:29:14,110
Ah, I'm into
the Vedek Assembly files.

498
00:29:14,178 --> 00:29:16,649
Can you retrieve
the communication files

499
00:29:16,684 --> 00:29:18,985
between the station
and the Assembly?

500
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:20,549
I'll need a time frame.

501
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:23,828
Uh, try the week leading up
to the Kendra massacre.

502
00:29:27,007 --> 00:29:28,567
That's odd.

503
00:29:28,611 --> 00:29:30,844
What?

504
00:29:30,883 --> 00:29:33,616
All the communications records
between the Assembly members

505
00:29:33,655 --> 00:29:35,454
and Bek for that week
have been sealed.

506
00:29:35,492 --> 00:29:36,984
- Sealed? By who?
- It doesn't say.

507
00:29:37,029 --> 00:29:39,364
It just indicates
a security seal.

508
00:29:39,401 --> 00:29:41,064
In the Assembly records?

509
00:29:41,105 --> 00:29:43,338
Who has that kind of authority?

510
00:29:45,481 --> 00:29:47,474
Only a Vedek.

511
00:29:55,536 --> 00:30:00,775
One, two, three, four, five

512
00:30:00,814 --> 00:30:07,284
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

513
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,228
Okay, okay.

514
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:13,572
Eleven...

515
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:16,514
Fine, 12, 13, 14.

516
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:20,590
And not a strip more.

517
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:22,288
I hate payday.

518
00:30:26,237 --> 00:30:28,264
Whatever she told you,
I didn't do it.

519
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:29,844
Relax, Quark.

520
00:30:29,878 --> 00:30:32,714
No one's accusing you
of anything.

521
00:30:32,752 --> 00:30:34,449
Eh, the day's still young.

522
00:30:34,489 --> 00:30:36,254
Don't be so defensive.

523
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:36,955
I can't help it.

524
00:30:37,088 --> 00:30:38,387
Between the two of you

525
00:30:38,424 --> 00:30:40,657
I'm developing
a persecution complex.

526
00:30:40,763 --> 00:30:42,528
I'm sorry to hear that.

527
00:30:42,566 --> 00:30:44,833
All right.

528
00:30:44,872 --> 00:30:48,573
What's going on?

529
00:30:48,614 --> 00:30:51,985
You want something from me,
don't you?

530
00:30:52,021 --> 00:30:52,989
How did you guess?

531
00:30:53,023 --> 00:30:54,150
It's simple.

532
00:30:54,192 --> 00:30:55,684
We've been here
more than a minute

533
00:30:55,796 --> 00:30:57,857
and we haven't insulted him,
threatened him

534
00:30:57,901 --> 00:30:59,268
or arrested him.

535
00:30:59,303 --> 00:31:00,567
Exactly.
So, what is it?

536
00:31:00,606 --> 00:31:03,442
And how much trouble
is it going to cause me?

537
00:31:03,479 --> 00:31:04,948
No trouble at all.

538
00:31:04,982 --> 00:31:08,478
We just need you to
bypass a security seal.

539
00:31:08,524 --> 00:31:10,357
Isn't that illegal?

540
00:31:10,395 --> 00:31:11,659
Oh, spare us.

541
00:31:11,697 --> 00:31:12,926
Quark, this is important.

542
00:31:12,967 --> 00:31:15,336
We need access to certain
communication files

543
00:31:15,372 --> 00:31:16,898
in the Vedek Assembly records.

544
00:31:16,943 --> 00:31:19,676
Perfect... not only is it
illegal, it's sacrilegious.

545
00:31:19,748 --> 00:31:23,188
I'm sure the Prophets
won't mind just this once.

546
00:31:23,223 --> 00:31:24,692
Okay, but I'm going
to have to have

547
00:31:24,793 --> 00:31:27,594
written authorization from you,
countersigned by Commander...

548
00:31:27,632 --> 00:31:28,691
Just do it, Quark!

549
00:31:28,802 --> 00:31:31,103
Sure, when things go wrong,
I take the fall!

550
00:31:31,141 --> 00:31:32,474
Nothing is going to go wrong!

551
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,705
That's what you think!

552
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:35,681
But I happen to be
a firm believer

553
00:31:35,717 --> 00:31:37,619
In Rule of Acquisition
Number 285:

554
00:31:37,654 --> 00:31:39,715
"No good deed
ever goes unpunished."

555
00:31:41,763 --> 00:31:43,859
You can access
the Vedek Assembly records

556
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,396
through the Bajoran
Central Archives.

557
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,171
Of course, I can

558
00:31:48,211 --> 00:31:51,616
if I wanted to barge in
like some rank amateur.

559
00:31:56,629 --> 00:31:59,260
This is going to take
a little while.

560
00:31:59,302 --> 00:32:01,637
I'll let you know
when I'm done.

561
00:32:07,821 --> 00:32:09,620
It happened right about here.

562
00:32:09,658 --> 00:32:12,961
Bek hanged himself in front
of dozens of witnesses.

563
00:32:12,999 --> 00:32:14,298
Caused quite a stir.

564
00:32:14,335 --> 00:32:16,168
At least he had the decency

565
00:32:16,206 --> 00:32:18,142
to feel guilty
about what he'd done.

566
00:32:18,177 --> 00:32:19,476
Strange.

567
00:32:19,513 --> 00:32:21,506
Bek and I were
passing acquaintances

568
00:32:21,551 --> 00:32:22,678
here on the station.

569
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,553
From what little
I knew about him

570
00:32:24,591 --> 00:32:26,561
I always thought
he was a good man.

571
00:32:26,595 --> 00:32:29,499
A good man does not betray
his own people.

572
00:32:29,535 --> 00:32:32,975
The one thing
I've learned about humanoids

573
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:35,447
is that in extreme situations

574
00:32:35,482 --> 00:32:40,323
even the best of you are capable
of doing terrible things.

575
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:41,726
Hey.

576
00:32:41,762 --> 00:32:43,391
Hey, Odo.

577
00:32:46,606 --> 00:32:48,132
The good news is

578
00:32:48,176 --> 00:32:50,340
I broke through
the security seal.

579
00:32:50,381 --> 00:32:52,909
The bad news is,
the file is empty.

580
00:32:52,953 --> 00:32:55,516
All the messages
have been erased.

581
00:33:02,942 --> 00:33:04,309
They're erased, all right.

582
00:33:04,345 --> 00:33:06,338
Is there anything
you can do about it?

583
00:33:06,383 --> 00:33:08,376
I could scan
the empty file for traces

584
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,014
of recurring data fragments.

585
00:33:10,057 --> 00:33:11,583
There's always a faint residue

586
00:33:11,627 --> 00:33:13,757
of the original data,
if you know where to look.

587
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:15,530
But to unscramble
those fragments

588
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:17,199
so they make
a coherent pattern

589
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,073
could take a while.

590
00:33:19,111 --> 00:33:20,170
So, what you're telling me is

591
00:33:20,213 --> 00:33:21,807
we're never going
to retrieve that information.

592
00:33:21,883 --> 00:33:24,377
Well, not in time
to do you any good.

593
00:33:24,422 --> 00:33:26,221
But hold on a second.

594
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,059
Let me see something.

595
00:33:28,097 --> 00:33:29,930
I may not be able
to get you the data

596
00:33:29,968 --> 00:33:32,269
but I might be able
to find out who erased it.

597
00:33:32,306 --> 00:33:33,969
Their retinal scan
would have been noted

598
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:36,140
by the authorization
subroutine when they logged on.

599
00:33:36,182 --> 00:33:38,847
But wouldn't the scans
have been erased, too?

600
00:33:38,888 --> 00:33:41,587
Sure, but even a fragment
of the retinal scan

601
00:33:41,627 --> 00:33:43,825
might be enough
to identify the user.

602
00:33:43,865 --> 00:33:46,564
Here. I'll run a sweep
of the authorization subroutine

603
00:33:46,604 --> 00:33:48,734
see if we can find out anything.

604
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,336
Okay.

605
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,783
These are
mathematical representations

606
00:33:52,818 --> 00:33:54,549
of a fragment
of the retinal scan.

607
00:33:54,589 --> 00:33:58,222
We can use these to reassemble
a portion of the original image.

608
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,329
Not bad.

609
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:04,605
Now we'll cross-reference this
with the Assembly's main archive

610
00:34:04,644 --> 00:34:07,617
see if we can find out
who it is.

611
00:34:15,768 --> 00:34:18,239
I think we've got something.

612
00:34:29,966 --> 00:34:33,201
Blessings on Kai Bareil.

613
00:34:35,946 --> 00:34:38,850
You.

614
00:34:38,886 --> 00:34:42,326
I trusted you.

615
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,490
I needed you.

616
00:34:44,531 --> 00:34:47,367
And you let me die.

617
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:09,017
You will be rewarded.

618
00:35:19,375 --> 00:35:22,473
Accept this gift
from the Prophets.

619
00:35:43,394 --> 00:35:46,925
May the Prophets
comfort you, my child.

620
00:35:46,968 --> 00:35:49,098
May they comfort us all.

621
00:36:07,814 --> 00:36:09,784
Come in.

622
00:36:13,995 --> 00:36:16,091
Nerys.

623
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:19,573
Did you really believe
I wouldn't learn the truth?

624
00:36:19,607 --> 00:36:24,312
The truth is not
always easy to recognize.

625
00:36:24,351 --> 00:36:26,321
I recognize it now

626
00:36:26,355 --> 00:36:29,020
and I don't like what I see.

627
00:36:30,865 --> 00:36:32,334
Why did you do it?

628
00:36:32,369 --> 00:36:36,470
Why did you erase
those transmission records?

629
00:36:36,511 --> 00:36:39,712
Don't make me do this.

630
00:36:39,752 --> 00:36:41,688
I don't have any choice.

631
00:36:41,722 --> 00:36:44,353
Winn is waiting to hear from me.

632
00:36:44,395 --> 00:36:46,593
Do you really want me
to tell her

633
00:36:46,633 --> 00:36:48,934
that you ordered Bek
to give the Cardassians

634
00:36:48,972 --> 00:36:50,737
the location
of that resistance base?

635
00:36:50,776 --> 00:36:53,247
That you are responsible

636
00:36:53,281 --> 00:36:56,311
for the deaths
of those 43 people?

637
00:36:59,394 --> 00:37:02,230
That you killed Kai Opaka's son?

638
00:37:12,222 --> 00:37:14,625
The Cardassians were determined

639
00:37:14,661 --> 00:37:18,432
to eliminate all resistance
in the Kendra Valley.

640
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:22,571
If someone hadn't told them
the location of that base

641
00:37:22,612 --> 00:37:26,644
they would have wiped out
every village in the area.

642
00:37:26,688 --> 00:37:30,493
That would have meant the death
of 1,200 innocent Bajorans.

643
00:37:32,266 --> 00:37:34,115
I could not allow that.

644
00:37:34,249 --> 00:37:36,846
There had to have been
another way.

645
00:37:39,594 --> 00:37:43,626
I believed in you...

646
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:47,405
I defended you

647
00:37:47,445 --> 00:37:50,441
and Winn was right all along.

648
00:37:53,458 --> 00:37:56,328
And now she's going
to destroy you.

649
00:37:56,364 --> 00:37:58,300
No.

650
00:37:59,805 --> 00:38:02,538
I've destroyed myself.

651
00:38:16,008 --> 00:38:17,307
What's our status?

652
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,973
Everything is under control.

653
00:38:19,015 --> 00:38:21,145
You received
a subspace transmission

654
00:38:21,185 --> 00:38:23,452
from Vedek Winn.

655
00:38:23,491 --> 00:38:25,393
She seemed anxious
to talk to you.

656
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,524
Open a channel
to the Vedek Assembly.

657
00:38:27,566 --> 00:38:28,967
Put it on monitor seven.

658
00:38:29,002 --> 00:38:31,029
I might as well
get this over with.

659
00:38:34,581 --> 00:38:38,112
I was wondering
when you'd contact me, child.

660
00:38:38,156 --> 00:38:40,719
I was waiting to complete
my investigation.

661
00:38:40,762 --> 00:38:43,929
I must congratulate you
on a job well done.

662
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:47,601
I knew the Prophets were right
in picking you to assist me.

663
00:38:47,677 --> 00:38:50,205
You sound like you already know
what I'm going to tell you.

664
00:38:50,249 --> 00:38:51,376
Oh, but I do.

665
00:38:51,418 --> 00:38:54,391
Bareil has just made
a surprise announcement

666
00:38:54,425 --> 00:38:55,552
to the Vedek Assembly.

667
00:38:55,594 --> 00:38:57,724
He's withdrawn himself
from the choosing.

668
00:38:57,766 --> 00:39:01,262
He no longer wishes
to be the next kai.

669
00:39:01,307 --> 00:39:03,574
I know this is painful
for you, child

670
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:06,846
but you've done a great service
for all of Bajor.

671
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:10,850
Whoever is chosen
tomorrow as the new kai

672
00:39:10,895 --> 00:39:13,834
will owe you
a debt of gratitude.

673
00:39:13,868 --> 00:39:16,396
May the Prophets guide you.

674
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,191
Are you all right?

675
00:39:44,235 --> 00:39:45,670
It doesn't make sense.

676
00:39:45,704 --> 00:39:47,674
Vedek Bareil is
an honorable man.

677
00:39:47,776 --> 00:39:50,213
He wouldn't hide
from the consequences

678
00:39:50,248 --> 00:39:52,446
of his actions
by covering them up.

679
00:39:52,487 --> 00:39:54,685
I'm missing something.

680
00:39:54,791 --> 00:39:56,226
Chief.

681
00:39:56,261 --> 00:39:59,462
I need to get back into
the Vedek Assembly archives.

682
00:39:59,502 --> 00:40:01,495
Yes, sir.

683
00:40:47,106 --> 00:40:49,373
Kai Winn.

684
00:40:52,217 --> 00:40:55,679
Your <i>pagh</i> is strong, my child.

685
00:40:55,725 --> 00:40:57,821
Be at peace.

686
00:40:57,896 --> 00:41:01,461
In time, you will learn
I am not your enemy.

687
00:41:01,504 --> 00:41:03,771
I hope that's true.

688
00:41:03,876 --> 00:41:06,507
I know you do.

689
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:08,712
Oh, and tell Commander Sisko

690
00:41:08,754 --> 00:41:13,196
I must postpone appearing
with him before the Assembly.

691
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,631
At least for now.

692
00:41:37,984 --> 00:41:40,717
Nerys?

693
00:41:40,757 --> 00:41:43,354
I didn't expect
to see you here.

694
00:41:43,396 --> 00:41:46,392
You forgot to erase
the transit files.

695
00:41:48,107 --> 00:41:50,738
I'm not sure I understand
what you mean.

696
00:41:50,779 --> 00:41:54,412
Oh, you did a wonderful job
erasing the transmission reports

697
00:41:54,454 --> 00:41:57,153
but you forgot
all about the transit files

698
00:41:57,193 --> 00:41:59,687
the files that prove
you weren't a collaborator.

699
00:42:01,971 --> 00:42:04,204
It's over.

700
00:42:04,242 --> 00:42:06,269
Let it rest.

701
00:42:06,313 --> 00:42:08,180
The people have chosen Winn.

702
00:42:08,217 --> 00:42:11,850
Only because you withdrew
and you didn't have to.

703
00:42:11,893 --> 00:42:13,522
The transit reports clearly show

704
00:42:13,563 --> 00:42:15,499
you were on a personal retreat

705
00:42:15,534 --> 00:42:18,005
at the Dakeen Monastery
during the week

706
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:19,338
leading up to the massacre.

707
00:42:19,376 --> 00:42:21,506
I checked the Dakeen
transmission reports.

708
00:42:21,547 --> 00:42:23,984
You had contact with no one

709
00:42:24,019 --> 00:42:26,582
except one transmission
after the massacre

710
00:42:26,624 --> 00:42:28,754
ordering you back
to the Vedek Assembly.

711
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:29,889
That's enough.

712
00:42:29,965 --> 00:42:32,459
No, it is not enough.

713
00:42:32,504 --> 00:42:36,275
There is no way you ordered Bek

714
00:42:36,313 --> 00:42:40,152
to reveal the location of
the Kendra Valley encampment.

715
00:42:40,188 --> 00:42:42,853
You were covering up
for someone else.

716
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:46,493
Someone who meant more
to you than me.

717
00:42:46,535 --> 00:42:48,802
More to you even
than becoming kai.

718
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,505
Please, Nerys, don't.

719
00:42:51,546 --> 00:42:52,913
Why not?

720
00:42:52,949 --> 00:42:55,682
It's the truth, isn't it?

721
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:00,332
Who else meant that much to you?

722
00:43:00,366 --> 00:43:02,633
It had to be Kai Opaka.

723
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:07,375
Opaka knew where the resistance
cell was located...

724
00:43:09,886 --> 00:43:12,221
because her son was a member.

725
00:43:14,397 --> 00:43:17,233
She was the collaborator,
wasn't she?

726
00:43:17,269 --> 00:43:22,873
She sacrificed her own son
to save 1,000 people.

727
00:43:22,915 --> 00:43:25,409
I had to protect her.

728
00:43:30,966 --> 00:43:32,435
So...

729
00:43:34,774 --> 00:43:38,579
instead of you,
we have Winn to lead us.

730
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,281
It is the will of the Prophets.

731
00:43:42,792 --> 00:43:44,785
The question is...

732
00:43:46,467 --> 00:43:48,563
where will she lead us?

733
00:43:50,242 --> 00:43:53,340
Down paths she cannot
possibly imagine.

734
00:43:53,382 --> 00:43:56,719
She's going to need
our help along the way

735
00:43:56,756 --> 00:43:59,592
even if she doesn't
realize it yet.

736
00:44:01,065 --> 00:44:02,967
What happens to us?

737
00:44:03,003 --> 00:44:05,406
What do you want to happen?

738
00:44:16,967 --> 00:44:20,463
Let's go pay our respects
to the new Kai.
