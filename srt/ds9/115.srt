1
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,011
QUARK:
I thought I told you
to cancel that order.

2
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:16,099
Now, what am I supposed to do
with 5,000 wrappages

3
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:18,310
of Cardassian<i> yamok</i> sauce?

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,770
They're the only ones

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,438
who could stomach
that swill.

6
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,022
Hey, Nog, are you going
to play or what?

7
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:25,066
You ordered it,
you're going to pay for it.

8
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:27,820
I'm going to take
half your paycheck every week

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,989
for the next six years!

10
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:35,828
From now on, no more
Cardassian food in here

11
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:37,329
ever!

12
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:39,790
Come on, Nog,
it's your turn.

13
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,834
5,000 wrappages.

14
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:45,128
That's a lot of<i> yamok</i> sauce.

15
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,214
Look, either
take your turn, or I win.

16
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,842
It'd be a shame
to let it go to waste.

17
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:52,720
That's it-- game over.

18
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,347
Jake, I'm getting
that tingling in the lobes

19
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:58,433
and when a lobe tingles,
it means only one thing--

20
00:00:58,433 --> 00:00:59,894
opportunity.

21
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:02,730
What are you talking about?

22
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,106
I'm talking about
gold-pressed latinum--

23
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:06,942
maybe four or five bars.

24
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:09,737
I thought you were
talking about<i> yamok</i> sauce.

25
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:12,990
You've got a lot to learn
about opportunity.

26
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,408
Come on.

27
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:15,951
Where?

28
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:21,081
SISKO:
<i>Station Log, Stardate 46844.3.</i>

29
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,791
<i>With the help of the Federation</i>

30
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,835
<i>Bajor is about to commence</i>

31
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:27,504
<i>its first large-scale</i>
<i>energy transfer--</i>

32
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:31,759
<i>the tapping of the molten core</i>
<i>of its fifth moon, Jeraddo.</i>

33
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,970
Magma pressure's
remained constant.

34
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:40,517
Differential subsurface
movement is at 0.3 percent.

35
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:41,810
Is that good?

36
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,812
They'd tell you
if it weren't.

37
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,940
Oh, uh, why is that
red light blinking?

38
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,650
We're in normal standby mode.

39
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,612
Oh, I take it, then,
we're not expecting
any surprises.

40
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:55,282
We don't like surprises
any more than you do.

41
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,951
Minister Toran, these
people are professionals.

42
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:58,994
Forgive my bureaucratic
nit-picking, Major

43
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,121
but we're counting
on Jeraddo's energy

44
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,748
to heat a few
hundred thousand

45
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:04,083
Bajoran homes
this winter.

46
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:05,876
And, with that in mind

47
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:08,587
we're due to make
our next inspection.

48
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:18,806
Anyway, so there I was,
sitting in Quark's

49
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:20,599
when Morn just
comes over to me

50
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,559
and invites me for dinner.

51
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,980
Grid square 12-delta
reads clear of life-forms.

52
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,398
Morn?
Are you serious?

53
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,192
Beginning scan
of grid square 15-delta.

54
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,236
So, what did you say?

55
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,989
I said I was busy.

56
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:36,698
Good.

57
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:40,619
But you know those seven
or eight little wiry hairs

58
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:43,413
that come out
of his forehead?

59
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,248
What?

60
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,960
Well, they make him
look kind of cute.

61
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,628
That's odd.

62
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:52,422
Sensors read a humanoid presence
in 15-delta.

63
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,258
Could be one
of the project thermologists.

64
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,011
Not in 15-delta.

65
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:59,680
Look for yourself.

66
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,264
All the inhabitants

67
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,350
were supposed to be
evacuated by now.

68
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,936
Well, I better
beam down there

69
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:08,229
take a look around.

70
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,984
Ready to transport.

71
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:14,111
I won't be long.

72
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:46,805
MAN:
The problem is, they
don't like uniforms.

73
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:50,684
Neither do I,
but it comes with the job.

74
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,686
Which is?

75
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,105
Do we talk, or do they attack?

76
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,116
You're halfway pretty.

77
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:07,617
Does that mean
I can come in?

78
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,744
No. No, I don't like
uniforms either.

79
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,830
I'm scared of them.

80
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,457
See, we had our fill
of uniformed bullies.

81
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,417
I'm no Cardassian.

82
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,712
You know you were supposed
to be out of here by now.

83
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:21,298
All I know is this farm, girl.

84
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:24,634
Now, you want proof,
just look at my crop.

85
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:27,428
Uh, I'd rather you
didn't call me "girl."

86
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,306
It's mostly katterpod beans

87
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,474
but you won't find
better katterpods.

88
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,353
My father always said
you get bigger katterpods

89
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:36,771
when you spray in
some chlorobicrobes.

90
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:37,856
Is that right?

91
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,107
Well, that could be.

92
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,817
Your family's
farmers then?

93
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,486
No, but if I don't get
on your good side soon

94
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,613
my arm's going
to fall off.

95
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:48,283
Yeah, pretty eyes like
yours deserve a meal.

96
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:49,617
You come on in.

97
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,536
I'm afraid
we don't have time.

98
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,621
Look, obviously
you were overlooked

99
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,207
in the general evacuation.

100
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:56,583
I got to get
you out of here.

101
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,210
We'll talk about
that over supper.

102
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,003
Come on.

103
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,347
There he is.

104
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:17,396
220, bottom price. 220.

105
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:20,065
(<i> scoffing</i> )

106
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,942
Excuse me, sir.

107
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,319
Are you the Captain
of the Lissepian
cargo ship?

108
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,071
That's right.

109
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:27,739
And you do a lot
of trading with
the Cardassians.

110
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,741
Why not? One thing
about Cardassians--

111
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:30,825
they pay their bills.

112
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,744
Yes, I've heard that.

113
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:35,205
I have also heard they
love their<i> yamok</i> sauce.

114
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:38,083
Look, if you're trying to buy
some<i> yamok</i> sauce from me, boy

115
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,209
you're wasting your time.

116
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,585
I'm not carrying any.

117
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,462
We're not buying,
we're selling.

118
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,964
5,000 wrappages of it.

119
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,924
Original, not
replicated.

120
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,302
Where would you two boys
get all that<i> yamok</i> sauce?

121
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:49,928
We have connections.

122
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:51,388
5,000, you say?

123
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,473
And they could
be yours for, say

124
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,184
five bars of
gold-pressed latinum.

125
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,103
That's a lot
of latinum.

126
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,230
That's a lot
of<i> yamok</i> sauce.

127
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,774
Look, I'm not carrying
any latinum

128
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:05,235
but I'll tell
you what I'll do--

129
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,737
I'll trade you
something for it.

130
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,823
We were counting
on latinum.

131
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,283
Hold on.

132
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:13,076
What would you trade?

133
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:16,246
I'll give you 100 gross
of self-sealing stem bolts.

134
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:19,707
Some Bajoran ordered them
from me, and now he can't pay.

135
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,419
Self-sealing stem bolts?

136
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:23,795
Top-grade merchandise.

137
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,880
You won't find
a better stem bolt

138
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,881
in this sector.

139
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,716
I don't think so.

140
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,510
We deal strictly
in latinum.

141
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:35,432
Nog, are you sure?

142
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,934
What are we going
to do with stem bolts?

143
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,520
What are we going
to do with<i> yamok</i> sauce?

144
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:49,029
Sir, I have discussed
it with my partner

145
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,947
and you have a deal.

146
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,449
Good.

147
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:55,910
I'll meet you at Cargo Bay 9
at 2100 hours.

148
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,121
We'll make the trade then.

149
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,292
Now, the question is,
what are we going to do

150
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:05,712
with a hundred gross
of self-sealing stem bolts?

151
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,714
I have a better question.

152
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:10,300
How do we get
your uncle's<i> yamok</i> sauce?

153
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,688
At least you're not the type

154
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:26,274
that's going to dispossess
a man on an empty stomach.

155
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,734
Wouldn't think of it.

156
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,528
Well, that's good,
'cause these roots

157
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:30,987
are going to take
three hours to soften.

158
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,989
What?

159
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:36,368
You wouldn't want
to eat your roots
hard, now, would you?

160
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:38,036
I'm in no hurry.

161
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:40,580
Kira to<i> Ganges.</i>

162
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,207
This is Dax.

163
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:43,708
Are you all right?

164
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,919
A man with
a talent for delay

165
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,547
has just invited me
to a farewell supper here.

166
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:50,173
You go on.

167
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,384
I'll have one of
the thermologists bring me back.

168
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,428
Enjoy supper.
Dax out.

169
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:56,304
Here you go.

170
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,805
You wash it off first

171
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,849
and then you scrape
the skin off.

172
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,202
You don't talk much.

173
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,204
Oh, they don't talk at all.

174
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:24,249
The Cardassians
took care of that.

175
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,918
They escaped up
to this moon 18 years ago.

176
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:29,379
I've been here 40.

177
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,339
We did real well together.

178
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,007
Oh, get out the plates

179
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,675
and utensils like
a good girl, would you?

180
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,677
That cupboard
right over there.

181
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,570
You know, you look real good

182
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,572
even from this angle.

183
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:58,283
But you know something?

184
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:01,328
You walk
like a carnivorous rastipod.

185
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,954
Now, look...

186
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:10,003
You're trying to make me mad.

187
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,631
How am I doing?

188
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:15,300
Not well enough
to get rid of me.

189
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,468
Damn!

190
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:18,386
(<i> sighs</i> )

191
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,679
Well,
what do they call you, dear?

192
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,307
I'm Major Kira.

193
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:23,975
I'm in charge of evacuating...

194
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:25,684
Your given name.

195
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,564
Nerys.

196
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:32,400
Nerys.

197
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,402
Well, Nerys, I'm Mullibok.

198
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,695
And these roots are really going
to take three hours to cook

199
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:38,365
so you might as well
just sit down

200
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:39,491
and relax yourself, child.

201
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:41,700
It's going to be tasty.

202
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,127
Mullibok...

203
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:54,339
they begin tapping the core
of this moon in seven days.

204
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,424
I know.

205
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,468
You are only three people.

206
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:01,137
This project is going
to benefit thousands...

207
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,805
hundreds of thousands.

208
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,933
I made myself unconcerned
with that 40 years ago

209
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,603
when I escaped
from a Cardassian labor camp

210
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:11,439
on your precious Bajor.

211
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,401
What we're trying
to create now

212
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,403
is what you weren't allowed
to have then.

213
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,407
It can be your Bajor, too.

214
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,908
This is where I live.

215
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,243
This is my home.

216
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,286
You can have a home on Bajor

217
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:28,373
with people to welcome you
and your friends.

218
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:32,544
Life will be different, yes,
but it will be fine

219
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:34,504
really.

220
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,506
No, it won't.

221
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,841
I told you, my life's here.

222
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,802
If I leave here, I'll die.

223
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:44,472
So I'd rather die here.

224
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,822
Dabo!

225
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,455
Uncle Quark!

226
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:11,124
You.

227
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:14,919
Last night, that dabo player
who dropped his drink?

228
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,171
I saw you run
and get him another one

229
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,381
without charging him.

230
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,593
I warned you

231
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:24,095
about picking up
your father's habits.

232
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,180
It'll never
happen again, Uncle.

233
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:38,276
You know, I was trying
to find some storage space

234
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:41,070
for the shipment of<i> lokarbeans</i>
<i>that are due in tomorrow.</i>

235
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,991
Is it okay if I stack them
on top of the<i> yamok</i> sauce--

236
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,701
if I can reach that high?

237
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,453
Please don't talk to me
about<i> yamok</i> sauce.

238
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,538
Do you want me
to get rid of it?

239
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,166
I could take it to the
matter reclamation unit.

240
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,042
Anything. Just get it
out of my sight.

241
00:13:57,211 --> 00:14:00,757
Nog... you're a good boy.

242
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:16,189
I stowed away aboard
a Cardassian survey vessel

243
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:19,108
which was making stops
all through the Bajoran system.

244
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,069
They were looking
for possible mining sites.

245
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,364
Anyway, when we got here
to Jeraddo

246
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,282
I overpowered the crew

247
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,577
and I stole whatever I'd need
to start building a life here.

248
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,995
You overpowered the crew?

249
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,330
Yourself?

250
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,624
There was
only six of them.

251
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,167
That was fortunate
for me

252
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:37,877
because I was
somewhat weakened

253
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,671
by the captivity
and starvation.

254
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,381
Anyway, here I was

255
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:44,467
the first person ever
to settle on this moon

256
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,052
and the only trouble was

257
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,928
that I didn't have any
kind of farm implements.

258
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,889
So, once again,
starvation and I

259
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,099
were staring each
other in the face.

260
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,268
Uh... I'm not
boring you?

261
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,395
No, no.

262
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,355
I want to hear who won.

263
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:58,773
Ah.

264
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,567
Well, it was
mind over matter.

265
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,151
Every 26 hours

266
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,529
I'd just tighten up my
waist belt another notch

267
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:05,822
and, that way, my
belly didn't know

268
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:06,865
that it was shrinking.

269
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:08,533
Excuse me?

270
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,744
You asked me to tell you
how I got started here

271
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,370
which I'm very
politely trying to do.

272
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,205
Now, will you
kindly let me finish?

273
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:16,666
I assume you found some food
before you ran out
of belt notches.

274
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,209
Are you telling the story
or am I?

275
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:21,462
By all means.

276
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,964
I can't wait
to hear how it ends.

277
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,175
Obviously, I was going

278
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:30,012
to have to plant
and harvest a crop.

279
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:33,057
So I did what
any person would do

280
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,309
who had to build
an entire world
for himself.

281
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:39,355
First, I rolled back
and forth on the ground

282
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,190
till it surrendered.

283
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,650
Then I got down
on my hands and knees

284
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,360
and I started to plow

285
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,195
using nothing but
my fingernails, mind you.

286
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,906
I plowed every furrow
in that field

287
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:49,657
straight as a plumb line.

288
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,618
Now, that is inventive.

289
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:54,120
Yeah. If I came
across a deposit
of mineralized clay

290
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,539
what I'd do is just
grind it up in my teeth.

291
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,875
That way, it
enriched the soil.

292
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,461
Baltrim, how about some

293
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,464
of that wonderful
wine here?

294
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,591
What I'm telling you, Major...

295
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:10,010
I tamed this place.

296
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,220
Me.

297
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,764
I believe you.

298
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:17,894
You look like a bit
of a fighter yourself.

299
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:20,354
Well, on Bajor,
we had to be.

300
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:24,066
To get rid of the
Cardassians, huh?

301
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,903
Mindless butchers.

302
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,112
We paid them back.

303
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,614
I bet you did.

304
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:32,283
They probably didn't
know what hit them.

305
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:35,202
I'm sorry
I missed the fun.

306
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,204
Fun?

307
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:40,249
Must have been like spearing
kandippers in a bottle.

308
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,543
Wait a minute.
Are you serious?

309
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,378
You know what
the Cardassians were like--

310
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,880
what weapons they had.

311
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,924
We didn't stand a chance
against them.

312
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:49,342
How did you beat them then?

313
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,511
Well, we beat them because...

314
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:58,225
because we hung on
like fanatics.

315
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,481
Hung on like fanatics.

316
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,280
I got to remember that.

317
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,416
Mullibok, listen to me.

318
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,960
One of these days

319
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,046
I'm going to have
to finish up that kiln.

320
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,298
Then I can temper my baking pots

321
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,509
put some colorful
lids on them.

322
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:34,053
That'd be nice,
wouldn't it?

323
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,930
I appreciate your trying
to hang on here.

324
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,765
I sympathize,
but you can't stay here.

325
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,560
The minute they start
tapping the crust

326
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,603
it will release carbon
and sulfur compounds.

327
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,104
It will make
the air unbreathable.

328
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,566
The Cardassians
probably told you

329
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,609
you didn't stand
a chance either.

330
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,069
Did you surrender?

331
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,863
No.

332
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:55,157
Why do expect me to act
any different than you?

333
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,743
Now, you tell them

334
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,494
they can start
cracking this moon apart

335
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,996
whenever they're ready.

336
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,748
I'll be here.

337
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,629
I'll tell them.

338
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,481
So that's a stem bolt.

339
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:30,068
A<i> self-sealing</i>
<i>stem bolt.</i>

340
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:31,360
There's a difference.

341
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,279
You're sure about that?

342
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,658
What's important is that
it's top-grade merchandise.

343
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,870
You can't get a better
stem bolt in this sector.

344
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,497
And we have
a hundred gross of them.

345
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,666
That's a lot
of stem bolts.

346
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,376
Excuse me,
gentlemen.

347
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:50,337
Anyone know what
this cargo's
doing here?

348
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,756
It belongs

349
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:52,882
to my Uncle Quark.

350
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,634
They're stem bolts.

351
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,761
Will you do me
a favor, and
tell your uncle

352
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:59,013
we're getting
a little weary

353
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,390
of him bypassing
import procedures.

354
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,434
I'll certainly
do that, sir.

355
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:05,478
It's just
that my Uncle Quark

356
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,396
really needed
some stem bolts.

357
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,274
You mean
self-sealing stem bolts.

358
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,026
That's right!
That's it!

359
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:14,070
<i>Self-sealing</i> stem bolts.

360
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,114
Well, he sure needs
a lot of them.

361
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:18,116
It's top-grade
merchandise.

362
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:20,493
You can't find
a better stem bolt
in this sector.

363
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,578
Oh, I don't doubt it.

364
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,664
What does
he need them for?

365
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,457
Uh, the usual.

366
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:27,750
The usual?

367
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,836
Well, you know.

368
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:32,379
Why does anybody use
self-sealing stem bolts?

369
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,674
I wouldn't know.

370
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:35,883
I've never used them.

371
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,426
Never?

372
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,345
I've never
even seen one.

373
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:42,264
Then how do you know
they're self-sealing?

374
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:46,393
I read it here
on the manifest pad.

375
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,858
I would have
bet anything

376
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,818
that he would have
known what they were.

377
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,695
I told you, we should have
asked that freighter captain.

378
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,905
Wait.

379
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,533
I know who could tell us what
self-sealing stem bolts are--

380
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,911
the Bajoran who ordered
them in the first place.

381
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:07,040
His name's got to be
on the shipping codes.

382
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,422
Sirco Ch'Ano.

383
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,466
It has his address
and everything.

384
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,094
You think he'll be mad
that we have his stem bolts?

385
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:24,431
He couldn't afford them.
Remember?

386
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:29,395
But we'll offer to sell them
to him at a discount.

387
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:43,201
I'm glad you finally
made it back.

388
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:45,619
I was getting
worried about you.

389
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,287
Is he alone?

390
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:50,624
I think Minister Toran
is in there with him.

391
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,626
Even better.

392
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,796
I don't understand.

393
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,007
There were 47 other people
living on that moon.

394
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,383
They all left willingly.

395
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,635
How do we know?

396
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,596
All we know is that they
obeyed the order to leave.

397
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,514
And so will
these people.

398
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,433
You haven't met Mullibok.

399
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,476
Is there anything
you can offer that might

400
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,229
make him more
willing to leave?

401
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:12,605
Not a thing,
believe me.

402
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,232
Would a postponement help?

403
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:15,942
Give us time to work
something out with him.

404
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:17,693
We can't postpone.

405
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,446
And, if he stays, he'll
be committing suicide.

406
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:23,074
We'll have to beam
him off the surface.

407
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:26,452
If we take him like that,
<i>we'll</i> be killing him.

408
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,621
I refuse to allow
three stubborn holdouts

409
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,497
to jeopardize a project

410
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:33,626
that will benefit so
many of our people.

411
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,335
I am sorry, Major.

412
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:36,587
If there was anything
else that we could do

413
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:37,838
we'd have done it.

414
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,548
But there is another way.

415
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:42,009
We can tap the core using
phased energy retrieval.

416
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,803
I thought we'd agreed

417
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,554
phased energy retrieval
would take too long.

418
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,473
It would mean
waiting a full year

419
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:50,143
before we can extract any
meaningful amount of energy.

420
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:52,186
I wish we had the time
to be more delicate

421
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:53,729
but we don't.

422
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,397
So, instead, we'll act
like Cardassians.

423
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,565
Easy, Major.

424
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:57,608
I resent that.

425
00:21:57,608 --> 00:21:59,359
It's obvious to me

426
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,695
that you've developed
a feeling for this man.

427
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,739
Fine, I can accept that.

428
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:07,285
But if you're not comfortable
with completing this assignment

429
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:09,495
I'll find someone else who is.

430
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:14,167
That won't be necessary.

431
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:22,591
Mullibok?

432
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,926
Mullibok?

433
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,636
What about
the other two?

434
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,096
They, uh,
have a cottage

435
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,597
35, 40 meters
through there.

436
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,183
Now, remember,
these people

437
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:31,934
were victims
of the Cardassians.

438
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:33,644
They don't speak.

439
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:36,730
They're very frightened
of uniforms. Understood?

440
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,440
Understood, Major.

441
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,526
If, uh, you find them
working in the fields

442
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:43,904
just gather up
their clothes and
supplies, I guess.

443
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,489
Without permission?

444
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:48,201
We're not going to
get their permission.

445
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:50,911
Just be very careful
with everything.

446
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,758
You plan to use that?

447
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:07,803
Protocol.

448
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,722
If you like,
I'll help

449
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,598
you pack your things.

450
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:14,601
You sent those two uniforms
after Baltrim and Keena.

451
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:17,604
That's right.
I'm doing what has to be done.

452
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:18,981
Me, too.

453
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:30,534
Don't make us take you by force.

454
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:31,952
Please.

455
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:38,751
I promise you,
it won't be so bad.

456
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,836
You can plant whatever
you want to on Bajor.

457
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:44,131
Stay by yourself
if you want to-- that's fine.

458
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,883
Take some seeds with you

459
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:49,136
for those terrible roots
of yours I had to eat.

460
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,846
Just listen to reason.

461
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,015
Listen to
yourself, Major.

462
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:55,059
Tell me what you hear.

463
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:56,310
What do you mean?

464
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,895
Well, I mean,
you sound

465
00:23:57,895 --> 00:23:59,479
like a two-headed
Malgorian I knew

466
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,315
when I was a boy.

467
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:03,776
You ever try to talk to
a two-headed Malgorian?

468
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,903
This is no time
for one of your stories.

469
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:07,780
See, the thing with
two-headed Malgorians is

470
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,324
that it can never figure out
what it really wants to do

471
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:12,326
and that can be very
confusing, believe me.

472
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:14,328
You know, eventually,
you're going

473
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:16,789
to have to stop talking
and deal with this.

474
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:19,166
And the trouble with
my Malgorian friend

475
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,377
was he had all
kinds of problems

476
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,837
and he couldn't decide
how to solve them.

477
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,257
So he'd always
come running to me

478
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:28,384
so I could solve
them for him.

479
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:30,136
Mullibok...

480
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:32,846
You know what I finally
said to that Malgorian?

481
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:37,684
I said, "Fellas, deal
with it yourselves." Hmm?

482
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:40,104
(<i> chuckling</i> )

483
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,192
Fine.

484
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,111
I'll pack your things myself.

485
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:48,112
Major!

486
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:49,738
They're crazy!

487
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,824
This man just stuck me
with a farm implement.

488
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,784
And she attacked
me from behind.

489
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:54,827
Let her go!

490
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:55,828
Stay back!

491
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:56,912
Let her go!

00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,747
(<i> grunting</i> )

493
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,461
No!

(<i> grunts</i> )

You!

496
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:13,887
Beam up to the runabout
and call the station.

497
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,555
Get Dr. Bashir.

498
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:17,141
Move!

499
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,028
SIRCO:
I still can't see you.

500
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,863
What did you say your name was?

501
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,866
I'm getting some kind
of subspace interference.

502
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,326
My name's...

503
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:37,995
We're the, um,
the Nog and...

504
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:39,913
the Noh-Jay Consortium

505
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:43,292
and we have 100 gross
of self-sealing stem bolts.

506
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:44,793
And we were wondering...

507
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,086
You have my stem bolts?

508
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,838
What would you want for them?

509
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:51,050
We'll let you
have them for...

510
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:54,345
five bars of
gold-pressed latinum.

511
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:55,804
Five bars?!

512
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:56,930
Four bars.

513
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,265
I don't think I...

514
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,017
Three bars.

515
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:03,062
If I had any latinum,
I'd already have the bolts.

516
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:05,439
Would you consider an exchange?

517
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:07,900
I would consider
one bar of latinum.

518
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,902
He doesn't
have any latinum.

519
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,695
Let's exchange
for something.

520
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,113
I don't want
"something."

521
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,656
I want latinum.

522
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,283
I can't hear you.

523
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:19,078
Can I interest you
in a piece of land?

524
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:20,079
Land is good.

525
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,205
For what?

526
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:22,789
It's nothing but dirt.

527
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,291
How much land?

528
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:27,086
I can let you have
seven tessipates.

529
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:28,712
Seven sounds good.

530
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:31,048
First<i> yamok</i> sauce,
then stem bolts

531
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:34,718
now tessipates--
and still no profit.

532
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,262
We're getting closer.

533
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:37,888
I can feel it.

534
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:39,265
You can?

535
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:40,849
I think so.

536
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,435
Do we have a deal?

537
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:45,062
We'd have to see proof
that you own the land.

538
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:46,813
Naturally.

539
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:49,567
You'll get the transmission
on that by 1200 hours.

540
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:53,195
You just bought yourself
some stem bolts.

541
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:55,114
Land.

542
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:57,283
Dirt.

543
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,203
(<i> Mullibok groans</i> )

544
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:04,373
Just rest easy.

545
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:07,418
You took a phaser blast
which punctured your peritoneum.

546
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:10,045
It's serious.

547
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:13,090
And if you try to move around,
you'll make it worse.

548
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,175
Another uniform.

549
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,594
Dr. Julian Bashir

550
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:17,761
Starfleet.

551
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,305
Major Kira sent for me.

552
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:20,598
She did, huh?

553
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:22,308
You're backwards, Nerys.

554
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:23,725
I told you.

555
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,692
With me unconscious

556
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:34,111
she could have swept us all
off of here

557
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:36,405
with no trouble at all.

558
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:39,908
My friends Baltrim and Keena?

559
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,744
They've been evacuated to Bajor.

560
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:45,581
I'll be taking you back
to our station, so I can...

561
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:46,790
No.

562
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,001
I stay here.

563
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:00,929
He refuses to leave.

564
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,640
Really?

565
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,643
Well, he's got
to be cared for.

566
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:08,145
I'm going to take him
without his permission.

567
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:09,938
No, you're not.

568
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,316
Well, he needs
close attention.

569
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:13,859
I'll be here.

570
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:16,195
There's no medical
facility here.

571
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:17,821
Leave the instructions

572
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,866
and whatever medication
you think he'll need.

573
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:33,711
She didn't offer a word
of explanation, sir.

574
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:35,922
She simply removed
her uniform tunic

575
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,341
and started building.

576
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:38,884
Well, Doctor

577
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:41,387
right now she stands
a pretty good chance

578
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:43,639
of being out of uniform
permanently.

579
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:45,891
I'm going
to tell Minister Toran

580
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:48,394
that she's remained
temporarily on Jeraddo

581
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:50,145
at your request.

582
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:53,023
But, sir,
that isn't true.

583
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:58,237
Make it true, Doctor.

584
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,072
Now, please.

585
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:04,493
Commander, I'd advise that
Major Kira remain on Jeraddo

586
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:08,372
for humanitarian reasons....

587
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:10,457
How long?

588
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,167
The next day or two.

589
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,545
For the next day or two, sir.

590
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:16,088
Thank you, Doctor.

591
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:18,298
I will consider that request.

592
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,008
Dismissed.

593
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:35,274
What's that?

594
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:36,734
It's for deep bruises.

595
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:38,736
Don't ask me why it works.

596
00:29:38,736 --> 00:29:40,571
I'm not the doctor.

597
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:43,990
What are they going to do
to you for staying here?

598
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:47,620
Probably the same thing
they're going to do to you.

599
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:51,164
I don't really know.

600
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,917
What are you
so angry about?

601
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,253
I don't really know.

602
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:01,300
(<i> sighs</i> )

603
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,637
When I was very small

604
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:07,806
I remember there was this tree
right outside my window.

605
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,558
It was the ugliest

606
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:12,852
most gnarled and battered
old tree I'd ever seen.

607
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:15,314
Even the birds
stayed away from it.

608
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:17,691
But you loved it, huh?

609
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:19,693
Hated it.

610
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:21,903
Because it had grown so huge

611
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:25,991
its branches blocked out the sun
for<i> kellipates</i>

612
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:28,702
and its roots buried themselves
so deep in the soil

613
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:30,829
nothing else could grow there.

614
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:34,416
Oh, it was a big,
selfish, annoying...

615
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:36,001
Nasty...

616
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:39,379
Nasty... nasty old tree.

617
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:41,423
Hmm.

618
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:44,677
Sounds to me like it had
a lot of character.

619
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:51,057
A lot.

620
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:54,311
So what happened?

621
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:55,479
Did you cut it down?

622
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,441
I don't know yet.

623
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:01,443
Sisko to Kira.

624
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,447
Commander.

625
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:07,407
I'm preparing to beam down.

626
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:10,703
I don't think
that's a good idea.

627
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:14,748
Major, either I'm coming down
or you're coming up.

628
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:19,545
He doesn't have much faith
in you, does he?

629
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,394
Nerys.

630
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,565
This is still my home.

631
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,235
What do you want?

632
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:45,111
I'm here to
see Major Kira.

633
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:47,364
Well, she doesn't
want to see you.

634
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:48,741
Neither do I.

635
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:49,825
Wait a minute.

636
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:51,535
Don't speak for me.

637
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:53,453
You know,
you're causing
a lot of trouble.

638
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:56,456
I can't tell you how delighted
I am to hear that.

639
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,500
How many of you
Federated uniforms

640
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,419
you going to send after me?

641
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:01,879
40, 50?

642
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:04,297
I don't think
it will come to that.

643
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,675
That depends on how bad
you want to get rid of me.

644
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:09,553
Mr. Mullibok, I'm here
because I'm concerned

645
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:11,388
about my First Officer.

646
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:13,724
What about her?

647
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:16,727
By staying here,
she's jeopardizing her career.

648
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,524
Would you
go back to bed?

649
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:24,484
You quit telling
me what to do.

650
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,027
Major

651
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,654
can I see you outside
for a minute?

652
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:31,199
Talk to him
as long as you want.

653
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:34,453
Why don't you tell
him the story
about your tree?

654
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:35,954
Be quiet.

655
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:39,499
There was this big,
ugly tree, uh...

656
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,627
Go on.

657
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:43,837
Never mind.

658
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:51,887
I can see why
you like him.

659
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:54,055
What can I do for you,
Commander?

660
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:57,100
You and I have a
material subsistence
report to finish

661
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,977
by the end
of the week.

662
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,354
I don't think I'm going to
be able to help you with that.

663
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:04,107
It's part of
the liaison
officer's job.

664
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,400
I know.

665
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,985
I don't like
the prospect

666
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,070
of having to
break in a new one.

667
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,114
You have a job
to do here, Major

668
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,699
and you're
not doing it.

669
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,200
It's not that simple.

670
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,202
I'm not saying
it's simple.

671
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:18,413
I'm saying
it can't wait.

672
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,415
(<i> sighs</i> )

673
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,167
Look... I understand

674
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:25,462
you're used to
sympathizing
with the underdog.

675
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:27,881
You've spent
your life fighting

676
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:30,425
to overcome
impossible odds

677
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,385
just like he's doing.

678
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:36,097
But you have to realize
something, Major.

679
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,517
You're on the
other side now.

680
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:45,482
Pretty uncomfortable,
isn't it?

681
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,613
It's awful.

682
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:04,668
When I first met you, Major

683
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:08,672
I thought you were
hostile and arrogant

684
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:10,716
but I was wrong.

685
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:15,595
Bajor needs you,
and I need you.

686
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,848
I like you

687
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:20,392
and I don't want
you to be hurt.

688
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:26,815
So, as a friend,
I'm here to remind you

689
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:29,526
that his fate
is already decided.

690
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:31,528
Yours isn't.

691
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,577
Thank you.

692
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:43,916
There will be a runabout
standing by.

693
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:48,545

I didn't say anything,
did I?

715
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,182
No.

716
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,642
You thirsty?

717
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:26,810
No.

718
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,227
Hungry?

719
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:30,396
No. Leave me alone.

720
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:34,400
Go back to sleep.

721
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:39,114
Where you going?

722
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:41,616
I'd like to get
some sleep, too.

723
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:45,537
Fine, bring the chair over here.

724
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:47,873
Well, are you
my nurse, or not?

725
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,216
Is this better?

726
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,427
Are you going
to talk all night?

727
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,346
Let me sleep.

728
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:15,192
(<i> snoring</i> )

729
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:33,459
Nog, I'm waiting.

730
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:34,836
I'm thinking.

731
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:36,213
About what?

732
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:39,091
Latinum, and how
we don't have any.

733
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:41,009
All we have is dirt.

734
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:43,553
How many times do
I have to tell you?

735
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:45,430
It's not dirt--
it's land.

736
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:48,474
What are we supposed
to do with this land?

737
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:50,102
Sell it, I guess.

738
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:51,603
To who?

739
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,312
Why do I have
to think of everything?

740
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:55,356
We should have kept
the stem bolts.

741
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,067
Land is better than bolts.

742
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:58,735
How do you know?

743
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:01,029
You can build things on land.

744
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:03,782
You can't build anything
without bolts.

745
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,283
(<i> sighs</i> )

746
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,953
Just throw down a card.

747
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,999
QUARK:
And you say they're based
here on the station?

748
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,417
ODO:
That's correct.

749
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:17,003
The Noh-Jay Consortium?

750
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,422
No, never heard of it.

751
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:20,423
Why do you ask?

752
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,008
I was contacted

753
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,760
by a government
official this morning.

754
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,678
They want to build
a reclamation facility

755
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:28,223
on a strip of land owned
by four different people.

756
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:30,475
Three of them
have agreed to sell

757
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:32,018
but the government

758
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:34,312
doesn't know how
to reach the fourth--

759
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,855
this Noh-Jay
Consortium.

760
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,941
You mean the government
can't build

761
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:39,901
without that
one piece of land.

762
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:41,444
Apparently not.

763
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,655
What a wonderful
opportunity for profit.

764
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:45,782
I told you that land
was better than bolts.

765
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:47,284
(<i> speaks Ferengi</i> )

766
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:48,785
And you think I'm part
of this Consortium?

767
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:50,870
I think very little
goes on here

768
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,705
without your knowledge.

769
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:54,791
True. This time, however

770
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:57,794
someone has failed
to include me.

771
00:38:57,794 --> 00:39:01,798
Are you telling me
you're not involved?

772
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:05,844
Oh, not yet,
but that will be remedied.

773
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:07,762
You can tell the Bajorans

774
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:11,683
I'll be opening negotiations
with them shortly.

775
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:31,494
Let's see.

776
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,872
Who on this station
is clever enough?

777
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:36,833
Uncle Quark?

778
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,001
Not now.

779
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:39,377
But, Uncle Quark...

780
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,962
Go sweep the floor.

781
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,421
It's important.

782
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:44,382
All right, make it fast.

783
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:48,594
I have a business opportunity
that might interest you.

784
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:50,347
Huh?

785
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:56,061
It'll only cost you five bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

786
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:06,071
Nog...

787
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:10,491
(<i> sighs</i> )

788
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:19,876
(<i> tiles clattering</i> )

789
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:21,627
(<i> sighs</i> )

790
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:27,050
(<i> groaning</i> )

791
00:40:57,914 --> 00:40:59,249
Any pain?

792
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:00,875
Just a little sore.

793
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,711
I was starting to think
you'd sleep all day.

794
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:07,757
That's because I
was taking care
of<i> you</i> all night.

795
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:10,635
I don't recall
asking you to do that.

796
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,513
I can handle this.

797
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:16,433
Go get something to eat.

798
00:41:16,433 --> 00:41:18,851
There isn't time.

799
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:24,690
You're finally leaving?

800
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,696
Last one.

801
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:47,297
I didn't think
I'd ever finish it.

802
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:49,507
It's finished.

803
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:52,469
Nothing to do
but fire it up.

804
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:35,761
What's all this?

805
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:37,263
You finished
your work.

806
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,765
Now I have
to finish mine.

807
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:41,809
But you don't want to.

808
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,020
I could use a friend on Bajor.

809
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,813
I'd like it to be you.

810
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:52,237
As long as that cottage
is standing, I stay here.

811
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:57,033
What the hell are you doing?!

812
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:59,244
Saving your life.

813
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:45,623
So you chose your uniform
over me after all.

814
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,041
That's not true.

815
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:49,377
The time
I've spent here with you

816
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:52,088
has meant so much to me,
but it's over.

817
00:43:52,088 --> 00:43:55,091
It's time we went on
with our lives--

818
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:57,302
mine and yours.

819
00:43:57,302 --> 00:44:00,472
You say you're my friend.

820
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:02,140
Prove it.

821
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,767
Use that weapon on me.

822
00:44:07,604 --> 00:44:10,815
I can't.

823
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:13,485
If I leave here, I'll die.

824
00:44:13,485 --> 00:44:14,819
No, you won't.

825
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:16,695
I won't let you.

826
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:29,459
Two to beam up.
