1
00:00:08,811 --> 00:00:12,307
I thought I told you
to cancel that order.

2
00:00:12,352 --> 00:00:16,350
Now, what am I supposed to do
with 5,000 wrappages

3
00:00:16,395 --> 00:00:18,730
of Cardassian <i>yamok</i> sauce?

4
00:00:18,766 --> 00:00:21,533
They're the only ones
who could stomach that swill.

5
00:00:21,572 --> 00:00:23,371
Hey, Nog, are you going
to play or what?

6
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,471
You ordered it,
you're going to pay for it.

7
00:00:25,515 --> 00:00:27,952
I'm going to take
half your paycheck every week

8
00:00:27,987 --> 00:00:30,356
for the next six years!

9
00:00:30,391 --> 00:00:35,961
From now on, no more
Cardassian food in here

10
00:00:36,004 --> 00:00:37,633
ever!

11
00:00:37,674 --> 00:00:39,975
Come on, Nog, it's your turn.

12
00:00:40,013 --> 00:00:42,246
5,000 wrappages.

13
00:00:42,285 --> 00:00:45,520
That's a lot of <i>yamok</i> sauce.

14
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:47,552
Look, either
take your turn, or I win.

15
00:00:47,596 --> 00:00:50,090
It'd be a shame
to let it go to waste.

16
00:00:50,135 --> 00:00:53,039
That's it... game over.

17
00:00:53,075 --> 00:00:55,706
Jake, I'm getting
that tingling in the lobes

18
00:00:55,748 --> 00:00:58,721
and when a lobe tingles,
it means only one thing...

19
00:00:58,754 --> 00:01:00,189
opportunity.

20
00:01:00,224 --> 00:01:02,957
What are you talking about?

21
00:01:02,997 --> 00:01:05,400
I'm talking about
gold-pressed latinum...

22
00:01:05,435 --> 00:01:07,234
maybe four or five bars.

23
00:01:07,306 --> 00:01:10,176
I thought you were
talking about <i>yamok</i> sauce.

24
00:01:10,212 --> 00:01:13,242
You've got a lot to learn
about opportunity.

25
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:14,618
Come on.

26
00:01:14,655 --> 00:01:15,954
Where?

27
00:01:17,295 --> 00:01:21,361
Station Log, Stardate 46844.3.

28
00:01:21,404 --> 00:01:22,964
With the help of the Federation

29
00:01:23,007 --> 00:01:25,137
Bajor is about to commence

30
00:01:25,179 --> 00:01:27,776
its first large-scale
energy transfer...

31
00:01:27,818 --> 00:01:32,089
the tapping of the molten core
of its fifth moon, Jeraddo.

32
00:01:32,127 --> 00:01:34,997
Magma pressure's
remained constant.

33
00:01:37,339 --> 00:01:40,779
Differential subsurface
movement is at 0.3 percent.

34
00:01:40,813 --> 00:01:42,282
Is that good?

35
00:01:42,317 --> 00:01:44,287
They'd tell you if it weren't.

36
00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:46,314
Oh, uh, why is that
red light blinking?

37
00:01:46,358 --> 00:01:48,955
We're in normal standby mode.

38
00:01:48,998 --> 00:01:51,937
Oh, I take it, then, we're not
expecting any surprises.

39
00:01:51,971 --> 00:01:55,604
We don't like surprises
any more than you do.

40
00:01:55,646 --> 00:01:57,309
Minister Toran, these
people are professionals.

41
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,514
Forgive my bureaucratic
nit-picking, Major

42
00:01:59,554 --> 00:02:01,421
but we're counting
on Jeraddo's energy

43
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:04,295
to heat a few hundred thousand
Bajoran homes this winter.

44
00:02:04,398 --> 00:02:06,061
And, with that in mind

45
00:02:06,102 --> 00:02:08,665
we're due to make
our next inspection.

46
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:18,487
Anyway, so there I was,
sitting in Quark's

47
00:02:18,529 --> 00:02:22,800
when Morn just comes over to me
and invites me for dinner.

48
00:02:22,838 --> 00:02:26,334
Grid square 12-delta
reads clear of life-forms.

49
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:28,680
Morn?
Are you serious?

50
00:02:28,718 --> 00:02:31,519
Beginning scan
of grid square 15-delta.

51
00:02:31,558 --> 00:02:33,528
So, what did you say?

52
00:02:33,562 --> 00:02:35,191
I said I was busy.

53
00:02:35,232 --> 00:02:36,861
Good.

54
00:02:36,903 --> 00:02:40,867
But you know those seven
or eight little wiry hairs

55
00:02:40,912 --> 00:02:43,679
that come out of his forehead?

56
00:02:43,718 --> 00:02:45,585
What?

57
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:48,220
Well, they make him
look kind of cute.

58
00:02:48,261 --> 00:02:49,890
That's odd.

59
00:02:49,932 --> 00:02:52,733
Sensors read a humanoid presence
in 15-delta.

60
00:02:52,771 --> 00:02:55,572
Could be one
of the project thermologists.

61
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,239
Not in 15-delta.

62
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,113
Look for yourself.

63
00:02:59,152 --> 00:03:00,781
All the inhabitants

64
00:03:00,822 --> 00:03:03,692
were supposed to be
evacuated by now.

65
00:03:03,728 --> 00:03:08,227
Well, I better beam down there,
take a look around.

66
00:03:10,576 --> 00:03:12,205
Ready to transport.

67
00:03:12,247 --> 00:03:14,114
I won't be long.

68
00:05:41,973 --> 00:05:45,504
The problem is,
they don't like uniforms.

69
00:05:45,548 --> 00:05:49,512
Neither do I,
but it comes with the job.

70
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,960
Which is?

71
00:05:51,995 --> 00:05:54,523
Do we talk, or do they attack?

72
00:06:03,286 --> 00:06:05,621
You're halfway pretty.

73
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:07,059
Does that mean I can come in?

74
00:06:07,095 --> 00:06:09,293
No. No, I don't like
uniforms either.

75
00:06:09,334 --> 00:06:10,803
I'm scared of them.

76
00:06:10,836 --> 00:06:13,273
See, we had our fill
of uniformed bullies.

77
00:06:13,308 --> 00:06:14,834
I'm no Cardassian.

78
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:18,250
You know you were supposed
to be out of here by now.

79
00:06:18,286 --> 00:06:20,917
All I know is this farm, girl.

80
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:24,330
Now, you want proof,
just look at my crop.

81
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:27,066
Uh, I'd rather you
didn't call me "girl."

82
00:06:27,106 --> 00:06:28,973
It's mostly katterpod beans

83
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,140
but you won't find
better katterpods.

84
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,983
My father always said
you get bigger katterpods

85
00:06:34,021 --> 00:06:36,322
when you spray in
some chlorobicrobes.

86
00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:37,349
Is that right?

87
00:06:37,395 --> 00:06:38,522
Well, that could be.

88
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,296
Your family's farmers then?

89
00:06:40,335 --> 00:06:43,205
No, but if I don't get
on your good side soon

90
00:06:43,241 --> 00:06:45,211
my arm's going to fall off.

91
00:06:45,246 --> 00:06:47,774
Yeah, pretty eyes like yours
deserve a meal.

92
00:06:47,818 --> 00:06:49,287
You come on in.

93
00:06:49,322 --> 00:06:51,292
I'm afraid we don't have time.

94
00:06:51,326 --> 00:06:53,296
Look, obviously,
you were overlooked

95
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,856
in the general evacuation.

96
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,164
I got to get you out of here.

97
00:06:56,203 --> 00:06:57,729
We'll talk about that
over supper.

98
00:06:57,773 --> 00:06:59,470
Come on.

99
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:09,692
There he is.

100
00:07:14,377 --> 00:07:17,213
220, bottom price. 220.

101
00:07:20,055 --> 00:07:21,524
Excuse me, sir.

102
00:07:21,558 --> 00:07:24,029
Are you the Captain
of the Lissepian cargo ship?

103
00:07:24,064 --> 00:07:25,363
That's right.

104
00:07:25,401 --> 00:07:27,371
And you do a lot of trading
with the Cardassians.

105
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,466
Why not?
One thing about Cardassians...

106
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,705
they pay their bills.

107
00:07:30,745 --> 00:07:32,271
Yes, I've heard that.

108
00:07:32,316 --> 00:07:34,913
I have also heard
they love their <i>yamok</i> sauce.

109
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,756
Look, if you're trying to buy
some <i>yamok</i> sauce from me, boy

110
00:07:37,795 --> 00:07:38,763
you're wasting your time.

111
00:07:38,797 --> 00:07:39,765
I'm not carrying any.

112
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:42,066
We're not buying,
we're selling.

113
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:43,800
5,000 wrappages of it.

114
00:07:43,841 --> 00:07:45,310
Original, not replicated.

115
00:07:45,345 --> 00:07:48,010
Where would you two boys
get all that <i>yamok</i> sauce?

116
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,519
We have connections.

117
00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:51,183
5,000, you say?

118
00:07:51,224 --> 00:07:53,251
And they could be yours for, say

119
00:07:53,295 --> 00:07:55,789
five bars of
gold-pressed latinum.

120
00:07:55,834 --> 00:07:57,804
That's a lot of latinum.

121
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,969
That's a lot of <i>yamok</i> sauce.

122
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,447
Look, I'm not carrying
any latinum

123
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,953
but I'll tell you what I'll do...

124
00:08:04,987 --> 00:08:07,356
I'll trade you something for it.

125
00:08:07,393 --> 00:08:09,420
We were counting on latinum.

126
00:08:09,464 --> 00:08:10,933
Hold on.

127
00:08:10,967 --> 00:08:12,596
What would you trade?

128
00:08:12,637 --> 00:08:15,804
I'll give you 100 gross
of self-sealing stem bolts.

129
00:08:15,844 --> 00:08:18,783
Some Bajoran ordered them
from me, and now he can't pay.

130
00:08:18,818 --> 00:08:22,087
Self-sealing stem bolts?

131
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,458
Top-grade merchandise.

132
00:08:23,494 --> 00:08:26,467
You won't find a better
stem bolt in this sector.

133
00:08:26,501 --> 00:08:28,368
I don't think so.

134
00:08:28,405 --> 00:08:31,036
We deal strictly in latinum.

135
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,213
Nog, are you sure?

136
00:08:35,254 --> 00:08:37,555
What are we going
to do with stem bolts?

137
00:08:37,592 --> 00:08:40,086
What are we going
to do with <i>yamok</i> sauce?

138
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:48,609
Sir, I have discussed
it with my partner

139
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,552
and you have a deal.

140
00:08:50,588 --> 00:08:52,148
Good.

141
00:08:52,258 --> 00:08:55,561
I'll meet you at Cargo Bay 9
at 2100 hours.

142
00:08:55,599 --> 00:08:57,592
We'll make the trade then.

143
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:02,070
Now, the question is,
what are we going to do

144
00:09:02,113 --> 00:09:05,314
with a hundred gross
of self-sealing stem bolts?

145
00:09:05,354 --> 00:09:07,381
I have a better question.

146
00:09:07,424 --> 00:09:10,328
How do we get
your uncle's <i>yamok</i> sauce?

147
00:09:21,522 --> 00:09:23,151
At least you're not the type

148
00:09:23,193 --> 00:09:25,824
that's going to dispossess
a man on an empty stomach.

149
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:27,300
Wouldn't think of it.

150
00:09:27,335 --> 00:09:28,998
Well, that's good,
'cause these roots

151
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,872
are going to take
three hours to soften.

152
00:09:30,909 --> 00:09:32,572
What?

153
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:36,053
You wouldn't want to eat your
roots hard, now, would you?

154
00:09:36,087 --> 00:09:37,750
I'm in no hurry.

155
00:09:38,827 --> 00:09:40,296
Kira to <i>Ganges.</i>

156
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:41,800
This is Dax.

157
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,393
Are you all right?

158
00:09:43,437 --> 00:09:45,567
A man with a talent for delay

159
00:09:45,609 --> 00:09:48,206
has just invited me
to a farewell supper here.

160
00:09:48,281 --> 00:09:49,750
You go on.

161
00:09:49,784 --> 00:09:52,221
I'll have one of
the thermologists bring me back.

162
00:09:52,257 --> 00:09:54,056
Enjoy supper.
Dax out.

163
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,893
Here you go.

164
00:09:55,931 --> 00:09:57,230
You wash it off first

165
00:09:57,301 --> 00:09:59,397
and then you scrape
the skin off.

166
00:10:16,843 --> 00:10:18,870
You don't talk much.

167
00:10:18,915 --> 00:10:20,885
Oh, they don't talk at all.

168
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:23,550
The Cardassians
took care of that.

169
00:10:23,591 --> 00:10:27,292
They escaped up
to this moon 18 years ago.

170
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,994
I've been here 40.

171
00:10:29,037 --> 00:10:30,939
We did real well together.

172
00:10:30,974 --> 00:10:32,705
Oh, get out the plates

173
00:10:32,745 --> 00:10:35,478
and utensils like a good girl,
would you?

174
00:10:35,518 --> 00:10:37,614
That cupboard right over there.

175
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,644
You know, you look real good

176
00:10:52,689 --> 00:10:54,682
even from this angle.

177
00:10:54,727 --> 00:10:58,030
But you know something?

178
00:10:58,068 --> 00:11:00,938
You walk
like a carnivorous rastipod.

179
00:11:00,974 --> 00:11:02,500
Now, look...

180
00:11:07,288 --> 00:11:09,555
You're trying to make me mad.

181
00:11:10,862 --> 00:11:12,331
How am I doing?

182
00:11:12,366 --> 00:11:14,929
Not well enough
to get rid of me.

183
00:11:14,971 --> 00:11:16,304
Damn!

184
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:20,446
Well,
what do they call you, dear?

185
00:11:20,484 --> 00:11:21,953
I'm Major Kira.

186
00:11:21,986 --> 00:11:23,649
I'm in charge of evacuating...

187
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,683
Your given name.

188
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,563
Nerys.

189
00:11:28,601 --> 00:11:31,802
Nerys.

190
00:11:31,842 --> 00:11:34,109
Well, Nerys, I'm Mullibok.

191
00:11:34,147 --> 00:11:36,482
And these roots are really going
to take three hours to cook

192
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:37,988
so you might as well
just sit down

193
00:11:38,022 --> 00:11:39,183
and relax yourself, child.

194
00:11:39,225 --> 00:11:41,252
It's going to be tasty.

195
00:11:48,378 --> 00:11:50,906
Mullibok...

196
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,980
they begin tapping the core
of this moon in seven days.

197
00:11:54,024 --> 00:11:56,085
I know.

198
00:11:56,128 --> 00:11:58,361
You are only three people.

199
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,769
This project is going
to benefit thousands...

200
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:02,034
hundreds of thousands.

201
00:12:02,074 --> 00:12:05,639
I made myself unconcerned
with that 40 years ago

202
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:09,384
when I escaped
from a Cardassian labor camp

203
00:12:09,457 --> 00:12:11,188
on your precious Bajor.

204
00:12:11,228 --> 00:12:14,258
What we're trying to create now

205
00:12:14,302 --> 00:12:17,639
is what you weren't allowed
to have then.

206
00:12:17,676 --> 00:12:20,045
It can be your Bajor, too.

207
00:12:20,081 --> 00:12:21,641
This is where I live.

208
00:12:21,685 --> 00:12:22,914
This is my home.

209
00:12:22,954 --> 00:12:25,551
You can have a home on Bajor

210
00:12:25,594 --> 00:12:28,726
with people to welcome you
and your friends.

211
00:12:28,766 --> 00:12:32,331
Life will be different, yes,
but it will be fine

212
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,277
really.

213
00:12:34,312 --> 00:12:36,373
No, it won't.

214
00:12:36,417 --> 00:12:39,150
I told you, my life's here.

215
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,593
If I leave here, I'll die.

216
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:43,998
So I'd rather die here.

217
00:12:59,786 --> 00:13:01,722
Dabo!

218
00:13:06,901 --> 00:13:08,530
Uncle Quark!

219
00:13:08,571 --> 00:13:10,370
You.

220
00:13:10,408 --> 00:13:14,179
Last night, that dabo player
who dropped his drink?

221
00:13:14,217 --> 00:13:16,347
I saw you run
and get him another one

222
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:17,618
without charging him.

223
00:13:19,528 --> 00:13:20,963
I warned you

224
00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:23,368
about picking up
your father's habits.

225
00:13:23,404 --> 00:13:25,271
It'll never happen again, Uncle.

226
00:13:33,025 --> 00:13:37,730
You know, I was trying
to find some storage space

227
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:40,605
for the shipment of <i>lokar</i> beans
that are due in tomorrow.

228
00:13:40,642 --> 00:13:44,275
Is it okay if I stack them
on top of the <i>yamok</i> sauce...

229
00:13:44,316 --> 00:13:46,013
if I can reach that high?

230
00:13:46,054 --> 00:13:47,921
Please don't talk to me
about <i>yamok</i> sauce.

231
00:13:47,957 --> 00:13:49,927
Do you want me to get rid of it?

232
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:52,935
I could take it
to the matter reclamation unit.

233
00:13:52,968 --> 00:13:55,838
Anything.
Just get it out of my sight.

234
00:13:57,178 --> 00:14:00,447
Nog... you're a good boy.

235
00:14:12,545 --> 00:14:15,518
I stowed away aboard
a Cardassian survey vessel

236
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:18,615
which was making stops
all through the Bajoran system.

237
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:21,391
They were looking
for possible mining sites.

238
00:14:21,431 --> 00:14:23,732
Anyway, when we got here
to Jeraddo

239
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,399
I overpowered the crew

240
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,902
and I stole whatever I'd need
to start building a life here.

241
00:14:28,947 --> 00:14:30,507
You overpowered the crew?

242
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:31,678
Yourself?

243
00:14:31,721 --> 00:14:34,056
There was only six of them.

244
00:14:34,093 --> 00:14:35,528
That was fortunate for me

245
00:14:35,562 --> 00:14:39,024
because I was somewhat weakened
by the captivity and starvation.

246
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,699
Anyway, here I was

247
00:14:40,741 --> 00:14:43,942
the first person ever
to settle on this moon

248
00:14:43,981 --> 00:14:45,040
and the only trouble was

249
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,247
that I didn't have
any kind of farm implements.

250
00:14:47,288 --> 00:14:49,281
So, once again, starvation and I

251
00:14:49,326 --> 00:14:51,627
were staring each other
in the face.

252
00:14:51,665 --> 00:14:53,635
Uh... I'm not boring you?

253
00:14:53,669 --> 00:14:54,796
No, no.

254
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:56,775
I want to hear who won.

255
00:14:56,809 --> 00:14:57,936
Ah.

256
00:14:57,978 --> 00:14:59,948
Well, it was mind over matter.

257
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:01,316
Every 26 hours

258
00:15:01,419 --> 00:15:04,050
I'd just tighten up
my waist belt another notch

259
00:15:04,092 --> 00:15:05,527
and, that way,
my belly didn't know

260
00:15:05,561 --> 00:15:06,529
that it was shrinking.

261
00:15:06,564 --> 00:15:07,725
Excuse me?

262
00:15:07,766 --> 00:15:10,101
You asked me to tell you
how I got started here

263
00:15:10,138 --> 00:15:12,108
which I'm very
politely trying to do.

264
00:15:12,142 --> 00:15:13,611
Now, will you
kindly let me finish?

265
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:14,945
I assume you found some food

266
00:15:14,983 --> 00:15:16,612
before you ran out
of belt notches.

267
00:15:16,653 --> 00:15:18,054
Are you telling the story
or am I?

268
00:15:19,425 --> 00:15:20,826
By all means.

269
00:15:20,862 --> 00:15:23,265
I can't wait
to hear how it ends.

270
00:15:23,301 --> 00:15:25,602
Obviously, I was going

271
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:29,374
to have to plant
and harvest a crop.

272
00:15:29,414 --> 00:15:32,387
So I did what
any person would do

273
00:15:32,421 --> 00:15:35,222
who had to build
an entire world for himself.

274
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:38,756
First, I rolled back
and forth on the ground

275
00:15:38,801 --> 00:15:40,566
till it surrendered.

276
00:15:40,605 --> 00:15:42,370
Then I got down
on my hands and knees

277
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,400
and I started to plow

278
00:15:43,445 --> 00:15:45,541
using nothing but
my fingernails, mind you.

279
00:15:45,582 --> 00:15:48,680
I plowed every furrow
in that field

280
00:15:48,723 --> 00:15:49,782
straight as a plumb line.

281
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:51,089
Now, that is inventive.

282
00:15:51,128 --> 00:15:53,361
Yeah. If I came across a deposit
of mineralized clay

283
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,031
what I'd do is just
grind it up in my teeth.

284
00:15:56,073 --> 00:15:58,567
That way, it enriched the soil.

285
00:15:58,611 --> 00:16:04,352
Baltrim, how about some
of that wonderful wine here?

286
00:16:04,391 --> 00:16:07,158
What I'm telling you, Major...

287
00:16:07,197 --> 00:16:09,258
I tamed this place.

288
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,395
Me.

289
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:11,963
I believe you.

290
00:16:13,811 --> 00:16:16,578
You look like a bit
of a fighter yourself.

291
00:16:16,618 --> 00:16:19,853
Well, on Bajor, we had to be.

292
00:16:19,891 --> 00:16:23,353
To get rid of the Cardassians,
huh?

293
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,427
Mindless butchers.

294
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,372
We paid them back.

295
00:16:27,408 --> 00:16:29,037
I bet you did.

296
00:16:29,078 --> 00:16:31,845
They probably didn't
know what hit them.

297
00:16:31,885 --> 00:16:33,878
I'm sorry I missed the fun.

298
00:16:33,922 --> 00:16:36,450
Fun?

299
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:40,228
Must have been like spearing
kandippers in a bottle.

300
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,569
Wait a minute.
Are you serious?

301
00:16:41,605 --> 00:16:43,735
You know what
the Cardassians were like...

302
00:16:43,777 --> 00:16:45,110
what weapons they had.

303
00:16:45,147 --> 00:16:47,277
We didn't stand a chance
against them.

304
00:16:47,318 --> 00:16:48,787
How did you beat them then?

305
00:16:48,822 --> 00:16:51,453
Well, we beat them because...

306
00:16:54,901 --> 00:16:58,306
because we hung on
like fanatics.

307
00:17:00,514 --> 00:17:03,384
Hung on like fanatics.

308
00:17:08,432 --> 00:17:11,165
I got to remember that.

309
00:17:19,856 --> 00:17:21,826
Mullibok, listen to me.

310
00:17:21,861 --> 00:17:23,330
One of these days

311
00:17:23,365 --> 00:17:26,338
I'm going to have
to finish up that kiln.

312
00:17:26,371 --> 00:17:28,740
Then I can temper my baking pots

313
00:17:28,776 --> 00:17:31,077
put some colorful
lids on them.

314
00:17:31,115 --> 00:17:33,382
That'd be nice, wouldn't it?

315
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,322
I appreciate your trying
to hang on here.

316
00:17:35,357 --> 00:17:37,156
I sympathize,
but you can't stay here.

317
00:17:37,195 --> 00:17:40,532
The minute they start
tapping the crust

318
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:42,629
it will release carbon
and sulfur compounds.

319
00:17:42,674 --> 00:17:44,234
It will make
the air unbreathable.

320
00:17:44,277 --> 00:17:46,042
The Cardassians
probably told you

321
00:17:46,081 --> 00:17:48,051
you didn't stand
a chance either.

322
00:17:48,085 --> 00:17:49,384
Did you surrender?

323
00:17:49,422 --> 00:17:51,016
No.

324
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:54,499
Why do expect me to act
any different than you?

325
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:56,162
Now, you tell them

326
00:17:56,203 --> 00:17:58,868
they can start
cracking this moon apart

327
00:17:58,909 --> 00:18:00,503
whenever they're ready.

328
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,448
I'll be here.

329
00:18:05,557 --> 00:18:07,892
I'll tell them.

330
00:18:25,868 --> 00:18:28,066
So that's a stem bolt.

331
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:30,042
A self-sealing stem bolt.

332
00:18:30,077 --> 00:18:31,740
There's a difference.

333
00:18:31,782 --> 00:18:34,015
You're sure about that?

334
00:18:34,053 --> 00:18:37,824
What's important is that
it's top-grade merchandise.

335
00:18:37,861 --> 00:18:41,357
You can't get a better
stem bolt in this sector.

336
00:18:41,402 --> 00:18:44,101
And we have
a hundred gross of them.

337
00:18:44,141 --> 00:18:46,271
That's a lot of stem bolts.

338
00:18:46,313 --> 00:18:48,010
Excuse me, gentlemen.

339
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:50,749
Anyone know what
this cargo's doing here?

340
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:53,590
It belongs
to my Uncle Quark.

341
00:18:53,629 --> 00:18:55,064
They're stem bolts.

342
00:18:55,099 --> 00:18:57,400
Will you do me a favor,
and tell your uncle

343
00:18:57,437 --> 00:18:59,567
we're getting a little weary

344
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:01,842
of him bypassing
import procedures.

345
00:19:01,881 --> 00:19:03,874
I'll certainly do that, sir.

346
00:19:03,918 --> 00:19:07,950
It's just that my Uncle Quark
really needed some stem bolts.

347
00:19:07,994 --> 00:19:10,727
You mean
self-sealing stem bolts.

348
00:19:10,767 --> 00:19:12,430
That's right!
That's it!

349
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,269
Self-sealing stem bolts.

350
00:19:14,308 --> 00:19:16,609
Well, he sure needs
a lot of them.

351
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:18,615
It's top-grade merchandise.

352
00:19:18,684 --> 00:19:20,985
You can't find a better
stem bolt in this sector.

353
00:19:21,023 --> 00:19:22,424
Oh, I don't doubt it.

354
00:19:22,459 --> 00:19:24,486
What does he need them for?

355
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:26,609
Uh, the usual.

356
00:19:26,742 --> 00:19:28,006
The usual?

357
00:19:28,046 --> 00:19:29,515
Well, you know.

358
00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:32,522
Why does anybody use
self-sealing stem bolts?

359
00:19:32,555 --> 00:19:34,184
I wouldn't know.

360
00:19:34,225 --> 00:19:36,092
I've never used them.

361
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:37,599
Never?

362
00:19:37,633 --> 00:19:39,603
I've never even seen one.

363
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:42,405
Then how do you know
they're self-sealing?

364
00:19:42,477 --> 00:19:46,418
I read it here
on the manifest padd.

365
00:19:50,462 --> 00:19:51,589
I would have bet anything

366
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,566
that he would have
known what they were.

367
00:19:53,602 --> 00:19:56,267
I told you, we should have
asked that freighter captain.

368
00:19:56,308 --> 00:19:57,902
Wait.

369
00:19:57,945 --> 00:20:00,746
I know who could tell us what
self-sealing stem bolts are...

370
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:03,951
the Bajoran who ordered
them in the first place.

371
00:20:03,991 --> 00:20:07,158
His name's got to be
on the shipping codes.

372
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,449
Sirco Ch'Ano.

373
00:20:15,483 --> 00:20:17,476
It has his address
and everything.

374
00:20:17,554 --> 00:20:20,219
You think he'll be mad
that we have his stem bolts?

375
00:20:21,931 --> 00:20:24,801
He couldn't afford them.
Remember?

376
00:20:24,837 --> 00:20:29,211
But we'll offer to sell them
to him at a discount.

377
00:20:40,972 --> 00:20:43,535
I'm glad you finally
made it back.

378
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:45,846
I was getting worried about you.

379
00:20:45,883 --> 00:20:47,512
Is he alone?

380
00:20:47,553 --> 00:20:50,890
I think Minister Toran
is in there with him.

381
00:20:50,927 --> 00:20:52,760
Even better.

382
00:20:54,401 --> 00:20:55,870
I don't understand.

383
00:20:55,905 --> 00:20:58,308
There were 47 other people
living on that moon.

384
00:20:58,344 --> 00:20:59,813
They all left willingly.

385
00:20:59,847 --> 00:21:01,248
How do we know?

386
00:21:01,284 --> 00:21:04,017
All we know is that they
obeyed the order to leave.

387
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:05,685
And so will these people.

388
00:21:05,727 --> 00:21:07,526
You haven't met Mullibok.

389
00:21:07,564 --> 00:21:09,660
Is there anything
you can offer that might

390
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:11,467
make him more willing to leave?

391
00:21:11,506 --> 00:21:12,975
Not a thing, believe me.

392
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,343
Would a postponement help?

393
00:21:14,379 --> 00:21:16,543
Give us time to work
something out with him.

394
00:21:16,584 --> 00:21:17,883
We can't postpone.

395
00:21:17,921 --> 00:21:20,688
And, if he stays,
he'll be committing suicide.

396
00:21:20,726 --> 00:21:23,129
We'll have to beam
him off the surface.

397
00:21:23,165 --> 00:21:26,730
If we take him like that,
we'll be killing him.

398
00:21:26,773 --> 00:21:28,903
I refuse to allow
three stubborn holdouts

399
00:21:28,945 --> 00:21:30,710
to jeopardize a project

400
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:33,846
that will benefit
so many of our people.

401
00:21:33,889 --> 00:21:35,358
I am sorry, Major.

402
00:21:35,392 --> 00:21:36,918
If there was anything else
that we could do

403
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:37,952
we'd have done it.

404
00:21:37,998 --> 00:21:39,592
But there is another way.

405
00:21:39,668 --> 00:21:42,766
We can tap the core using
phased energy retrieval.

406
00:21:42,808 --> 00:21:43,867
I thought we'd agreed

407
00:21:43,911 --> 00:21:45,881
phased energy retrieval
would take too long.

408
00:21:45,915 --> 00:21:47,612
It would mean
waiting a full year

409
00:21:47,652 --> 00:21:50,522
before we can extract any
meaningful amount of energy.

410
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,792
I wish we had the time
to be more delicate

411
00:21:52,831 --> 00:21:53,799
but we don't.

412
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,632
So, instead, we'll act
like Cardassians.

413
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:57,037
Easy, Major.

414
00:21:57,073 --> 00:21:58,372
I resent that.

415
00:21:58,409 --> 00:21:59,434
It's obvious to me

416
00:21:59,478 --> 00:22:02,075
that you've developed
a feeling for this man.

417
00:22:02,118 --> 00:22:03,587
Fine, I can accept that.

418
00:22:03,653 --> 00:22:07,560
But if you're not comfortable
with completing this assignment

419
00:22:07,596 --> 00:22:09,566
I'll find someone else who is.

420
00:22:11,938 --> 00:22:14,307
That won't be necessary.

421
00:22:21,193 --> 00:22:22,753
Mullibok?

422
00:22:22,796 --> 00:22:24,265
Mullibok?

423
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:26,098
What about the other two?

424
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,972
They, uh, have a cottage
35, 40 meters through there.

425
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:32,279
Now, remember, these people
were victims of the Cardassians.

426
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:33,946
They don't speak.

427
00:22:33,987 --> 00:22:36,960
They're very frightened
of uniforms. Understood?

428
00:22:36,993 --> 00:22:38,462
Understood, Major.

429
00:22:38,497 --> 00:22:40,934
If, uh, you find them
working in the fields

430
00:22:40,969 --> 00:22:44,272
just gather up their clothes
and supplies, I guess.

431
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,779
Without permission?

432
00:22:45,813 --> 00:22:48,512
We're not going to get
their permission.

433
00:22:48,552 --> 00:22:51,080
Just be very careful
with everything.

434
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,777
You plan to use that?

435
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:08,185
Protocol.

436
00:23:08,229 --> 00:23:11,760
If you like, I'll help
you pack your things.

437
00:23:11,803 --> 00:23:14,935
You sent those two uniforms
after Baltrim and Keena.

438
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:17,813
That's right.
I'm doing what has to be done.

439
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,183
Me, too.

440
00:23:27,238 --> 00:23:30,700
Don't make us take you by force.

441
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:32,078
Please.

442
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:38,059
I promise you,
it won't be so bad.

443
00:23:38,095 --> 00:23:41,262
You can plant whatever
you want to on Bajor.

444
00:23:41,302 --> 00:23:44,434
Stay by yourself
if you want to... that's fine.

445
00:23:44,475 --> 00:23:46,274
Take some seeds with you

446
00:23:46,313 --> 00:23:49,445
for those terrible roots
of yours I had to eat.

447
00:23:49,486 --> 00:23:51,251
Just listen to reason.

448
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:53,386
Listen to yourself, Major.

449
00:23:53,428 --> 00:23:55,421
Tell me what you hear.

450
00:23:55,466 --> 00:23:56,935
What do you mean?

451
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:58,028
Well, I mean, you sound

452
00:23:58,072 --> 00:23:59,769
like a two-headed
Malgorian I knew

453
00:23:59,809 --> 00:24:01,369
when I was a boy.

454
00:24:01,413 --> 00:24:04,044
You ever try to talk
to a two-headed Malgorian?

455
00:24:04,085 --> 00:24:06,249
This is no time
for one of your stories.

456
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:08,157
See, the thing with
two-headed Malgorians is

457
00:24:08,194 --> 00:24:10,665
that it can never figure out
what it really wants to do

458
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,636
and that can be very
confusing, believe me.

459
00:24:12,671 --> 00:24:14,607
You know, eventually,
you're going

460
00:24:14,641 --> 00:24:17,169
to have to stop talking
and deal with this.

461
00:24:17,214 --> 00:24:19,549
And the trouble
with my Malgorian friend

462
00:24:19,585 --> 00:24:21,749
was he had all kinds of problems

463
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:24,319
and he couldn't decide
how to solve them.

464
00:24:24,363 --> 00:24:26,561
So he'd always
come running to me

465
00:24:26,601 --> 00:24:28,902
so I could solve them for him.

466
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,409
Mullibok...

467
00:24:30,443 --> 00:24:33,313
You know what I finally
said to that Malgorian?

468
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:37,917
I said, "Fellas, deal
with it yourselves." Hmm?

469
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,539
Fine.

470
00:24:45,577 --> 00:24:47,479
I'll pack your things myself.

471
00:24:47,514 --> 00:24:48,743
Major!

472
00:24:48,783 --> 00:24:49,773
They're crazy!

473
00:24:49,819 --> 00:24:52,154
This man just stuck me
with a farm implement.

474
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,023
And she attacked me from behind.

475
00:24:54,062 --> 00:24:55,030
Let her go!

476
00:24:55,064 --> 00:24:56,032
Stay back!

477
00:24:56,066 --> 00:24:57,227
Let her go!

478
00:25:02,614 --> 00:25:03,878
No!

479
00:25:10,698 --> 00:25:12,133
You!

480
00:25:12,168 --> 00:25:14,138
Beam up to the runabout
and call the station.

481
00:25:14,173 --> 00:25:15,802
Get Dr. Bashir.

482
00:25:15,843 --> 00:25:17,335
Move!

483
00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:29,201
I still can't see you.

484
00:25:29,239 --> 00:25:31,369
What did you say your name was?

485
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:34,075
I'm getting some kind
of subspace interference.

486
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,745
My name's...

487
00:25:35,787 --> 00:25:38,350
We're the, um, the Nog and...

488
00:25:38,392 --> 00:25:40,191
the Noh-Jay Consortium

489
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:43,601
and we have 100 gross
of self-sealing stem bolts.

490
00:25:43,637 --> 00:25:45,004
And we were wondering...

491
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,373
You have my stem bolts?

492
00:25:46,409 --> 00:25:48,106
What would you want for them?

493
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:51,518
We'll let you have them for...

494
00:25:51,555 --> 00:25:54,687
five bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

495
00:25:54,728 --> 00:25:56,027
Five bars?!

496
00:25:56,064 --> 00:25:57,191
Four bars.

497
00:25:57,233 --> 00:25:58,600
I don't think I...

498
00:25:58,637 --> 00:26:00,368
Three bars.

499
00:26:00,407 --> 00:26:03,437
If I had any latinum,
I'd already have the bolts.

500
00:26:03,481 --> 00:26:05,782
Would you consider an exchange?

501
00:26:05,819 --> 00:26:08,120
I would consider
one bar of latinum.

502
00:26:08,158 --> 00:26:10,128
He doesn't have any latinum.

503
00:26:10,162 --> 00:26:11,961
Let's exchange for something.

504
00:26:11,999 --> 00:26:13,468
I don't want "something."

505
00:26:13,503 --> 00:26:14,870
I want latinum.

506
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:16,272
I can't hear you.

507
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:19,282
Can I interest you
in a piece of land?

508
00:26:19,316 --> 00:26:20,443
Land is good.

509
00:26:20,484 --> 00:26:21,509
For what?

510
00:26:21,554 --> 00:26:22,989
It's nothing but dirt.

511
00:26:23,023 --> 00:26:24,492
How much land?

512
00:26:24,527 --> 00:26:27,328
I can let you have
seven tessipates.

513
00:26:27,367 --> 00:26:28,836
Seven sounds good.

514
00:26:28,869 --> 00:26:31,340
First <i>yamok</i> sauce,
then stem bolts

515
00:26:31,375 --> 00:26:34,906
now tessipates...
and still no profit.

516
00:26:35,017 --> 00:26:36,577
We're getting closer.

517
00:26:36,621 --> 00:26:38,090
I can feel it.

518
00:26:38,123 --> 00:26:39,592
You can?

519
00:26:39,627 --> 00:26:41,096
I think so.

520
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:42,599
Do we have a deal?

521
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:45,435
We'd have to see proof
that you own the land.

522
00:26:45,473 --> 00:26:46,045
Naturally.

523
00:26:46,178 --> 00:26:49,151
You'll get the transmission
on that by 1200 hours.

524
00:26:49,185 --> 00:26:52,818
You just bought yourself
some stem bolts.

525
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,762
Land.

526
00:26:54,797 --> 00:26:56,664
Dirt.

527
00:27:00,878 --> 00:27:03,281
Just rest easy.

528
00:27:03,316 --> 00:27:07,017
You took a phaser blast
which punctured your peritoneum.

529
00:27:07,057 --> 00:27:08,549
It's serious.

530
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:12,592
And if you try to move around,
you'll make it worse.

531
00:27:12,637 --> 00:27:14,767
Another uniform.

532
00:27:14,807 --> 00:27:17,210
Dr. Julian Bashir, Starfleet.

533
00:27:17,313 --> 00:27:18,907
Major Kira sent for me.

534
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:20,179
She did, huh?

535
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,917
You're backwards, Nerys.

536
00:27:21,957 --> 00:27:23,118
I told you.

537
00:27:30,576 --> 00:27:32,045
With me unconscious

538
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:34,516
she could have swept us all
off of here

539
00:27:34,551 --> 00:27:36,521
with no trouble at all.

540
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:39,425
My friends Baltrim and Keena?

541
00:27:39,462 --> 00:27:41,432
They've been evacuated to Bajor.

542
00:27:41,466 --> 00:27:45,167
I'll be taking you back
to our station, so I can...

543
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:46,267
No.

544
00:27:46,377 --> 00:27:48,644
I stay here.

545
00:27:57,969 --> 00:28:00,440
He refuses to leave.

546
00:28:00,475 --> 00:28:02,240
Really?

547
00:28:02,312 --> 00:28:04,749
Well, he's got to be cared for.

548
00:28:04,784 --> 00:28:07,757
I'm going to take him
without his permission.

549
00:28:07,791 --> 00:28:09,420
No, you're not.

550
00:28:09,461 --> 00:28:11,955
Well, he needs close attention.

551
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,469
I'll be here.

552
00:28:13,504 --> 00:28:15,634
There's no medical facility
here.

553
00:28:15,675 --> 00:28:17,201
Leave the instructions

554
00:28:17,245 --> 00:28:20,241
and whatever medication
you think he'll need.

555
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:33,312
She didn't offer a word
of explanation, sir.

556
00:28:33,381 --> 00:28:35,442
She simply removed
her uniform tunic

557
00:28:35,485 --> 00:28:36,954
and started building.

558
00:28:36,988 --> 00:28:38,321
Well, Doctor

559
00:28:38,392 --> 00:28:41,023
right now she stands
a pretty good chance

560
00:28:41,064 --> 00:28:43,262
of being out of uniform
permanently.

561
00:28:43,302 --> 00:28:45,466
I'm going
to tell Minister Toran

562
00:28:45,507 --> 00:28:48,001
that she's remained
temporarily on Jeraddo

563
00:28:48,046 --> 00:28:49,845
at your request.

564
00:28:49,883 --> 00:28:52,411
But, sir, that isn't true.

565
00:28:55,095 --> 00:28:57,692
Make it true, Doctor.

566
00:28:57,734 --> 00:28:59,704
Now, please.

567
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:04,077
Commander, I'd advise that
Major Kira remain on Jeraddo

568
00:29:04,114 --> 00:29:07,987
for humanitarian reasons...

569
00:29:08,023 --> 00:29:10,050
How long?

570
00:29:10,095 --> 00:29:11,621
The next day or two.

571
00:29:11,664 --> 00:29:14,135
For the next day or two, sir.

572
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,571
Thank you, Doctor.

573
00:29:15,606 --> 00:29:17,941
I will consider that request.

574
00:29:17,978 --> 00:29:19,379
Dismissed.

575
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:34,747
What's that?

576
00:29:34,782 --> 00:29:36,308
It's for deep bruises.

577
00:29:36,352 --> 00:29:38,322
Don't ask me why it works.

578
00:29:38,356 --> 00:29:40,053
I'm not the doctor.

579
00:29:40,094 --> 00:29:43,556
What are they going to do
to you for staying here?

580
00:29:43,602 --> 00:29:47,235
Probably the same thing
they're going to do to you.

581
00:29:47,276 --> 00:29:50,875
I don't really know.

582
00:29:50,918 --> 00:29:53,412
What are you so angry about?

583
00:29:53,524 --> 00:29:55,620
I don't really know.

584
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:04,276
When I was very small

585
00:30:04,314 --> 00:30:07,412
I remember there was this tree
right outside my window.

586
00:30:07,453 --> 00:30:09,150
It was the ugliest

587
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:12,459
most gnarled and battered
old tree I'd ever seen.

588
00:30:12,531 --> 00:30:14,900
Even the birds
stayed away from it.

589
00:30:14,937 --> 00:30:17,340
But you loved it, huh?

590
00:30:17,375 --> 00:30:19,345
Hated it.

591
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,476
Because it had grown so huge

592
00:30:21,551 --> 00:30:24,854
its branches blocked out the sun
for <i>kellipates</i>

593
00:30:24,892 --> 00:30:28,332
and its roots buried themselves
so deep in the soil

594
00:30:28,366 --> 00:30:30,496
nothing else could grow there.

595
00:30:30,571 --> 00:30:34,136
Oh, it was a big,
selfish, annoying...

596
00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:35,614
Nasty...

597
00:30:35,649 --> 00:30:39,111
Nasty... nasty old tree.

598
00:30:39,156 --> 00:30:41,217
Hmm.

599
00:30:41,261 --> 00:30:45,532
Sounds to me like it had
a lot of character.

600
00:30:48,544 --> 00:30:50,537
A lot.

601
00:30:52,285 --> 00:30:54,084
So what happened?

602
00:30:54,123 --> 00:30:55,752
Did you cut it down?

603
00:30:55,793 --> 00:30:58,232
I don't know yet.

604
00:30:58,232 --> 00:30:58,722
I don't know yet.

605
00:30:58,767 --> 00:31:00,863
Sisko to Kira.

606
00:31:03,711 --> 00:31:05,180
Commander.

607
00:31:05,214 --> 00:31:07,184
I'm preparing to beam down.

608
00:31:07,218 --> 00:31:10,019
I don't think
that's a good idea.

609
00:31:10,058 --> 00:31:14,261
Major, either I'm coming down
or you're coming up.

610
00:31:16,172 --> 00:31:19,008
He doesn't have much faith
in you, does he?

611
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:34,808
Nerys.

612
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:39,020
This is still my home.

613
00:31:41,127 --> 00:31:43,097
What do you want?

614
00:31:43,131 --> 00:31:44,760
I'm here to see Major Kira.

615
00:31:44,801 --> 00:31:46,897
Well, she doesn't
want to see you.

616
00:31:46,939 --> 00:31:48,568
Neither do I.

617
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:49,909
Wait a minute.

618
00:31:49,945 --> 00:31:51,244
Don't speak for me.

619
00:31:51,282 --> 00:31:53,252
You know, you're causing
a lot of trouble.

620
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:56,259
I can't tell you how delighted
I am to hear that.

621
00:31:56,293 --> 00:31:58,263
How many of you
Federated uniforms

622
00:31:58,297 --> 00:32:00,164
you going to send after me?

623
00:32:00,201 --> 00:32:01,568
40, 50?

624
00:32:01,638 --> 00:32:03,939
I don't think
it will come to that.

625
00:32:03,976 --> 00:32:06,880
That depends on how bad
you want to get rid of me.

626
00:32:06,917 --> 00:32:09,582
Mr. Mullibok, I'm here
because I'm concerned

627
00:32:09,656 --> 00:32:11,091
about my First Officer.

628
00:32:11,126 --> 00:32:13,859
What about her?

629
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:17,201
By staying here,
she's jeopardizing her career.

630
00:32:20,246 --> 00:32:22,216
Would you go back to bed?

631
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,220
You quit telling me what to do.

632
00:32:24,254 --> 00:32:25,553
Major

633
00:32:25,591 --> 00:32:27,220
can I see you outside
for a minute?

634
00:32:28,664 --> 00:32:30,965
Talk to him as long as you want.

635
00:32:31,002 --> 00:32:33,975
Why don't you tell him
the story about your tree?

636
00:32:34,009 --> 00:32:35,638
Be quiet.

637
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,210
There was this big,
ugly tree, uh...

638
00:32:39,254 --> 00:32:41,315
Go on.

639
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:43,386
Never mind.

640
00:32:48,775 --> 00:32:51,576
I can see why you like him.

641
00:32:51,614 --> 00:32:53,675
What can I do for you,
Commander?

642
00:32:53,786 --> 00:32:56,690
You and I have a material
subsistence report to finish

643
00:32:56,792 --> 00:32:58,694
by the end of the week.

644
00:32:58,797 --> 00:33:01,360
I don't think I'm going to
be able to help you with that.

645
00:33:01,403 --> 00:33:03,636
It's part of
the liaison officer's job.

646
00:33:03,741 --> 00:33:05,074
I know.

647
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:08,743
I don't like the prospect
of having to break in a new one.

648
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:10,813
You have a job to do here, Major

649
00:33:10,856 --> 00:33:12,416
and you're not doing it.

650
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,929
It's not that simple.

651
00:33:13,964 --> 00:33:15,934
I'm not saying it's simple.

652
00:33:15,968 --> 00:33:17,961
I'm saying it can't wait.

653
00:33:19,977 --> 00:33:21,947
Look... I understand

654
00:33:21,981 --> 00:33:25,318
you're used to sympathizing
with the underdog.

655
00:33:25,356 --> 00:33:30,095
You've spent your life fighting
to overcome impossible odds

656
00:33:30,132 --> 00:33:32,102
just like he's doing.

657
00:33:32,137 --> 00:33:35,838
But you have to realize
something, Major.

658
00:33:35,878 --> 00:33:39,579
You're on the other side now.

659
00:33:43,194 --> 00:33:46,030
Pretty uncomfortable, isn't it?

660
00:33:49,374 --> 00:33:52,313
It's awful.

661
00:34:01,234 --> 00:34:04,366
When I first met you, Major

662
00:34:04,407 --> 00:34:08,576
I thought you were
hostile and arrogant

663
00:34:08,616 --> 00:34:10,478
but I was wrong.

664
00:34:10,612 --> 00:34:15,214
Bajor needs you, and I need you.

665
00:34:15,289 --> 00:34:17,054
I like you

666
00:34:17,093 --> 00:34:20,430
and I don't want you to be hurt.

667
00:34:22,271 --> 00:34:26,076
So, as a friend,
I'm here to remind you

668
00:34:26,112 --> 00:34:28,583
that his fate
is already decided.

669
00:34:28,618 --> 00:34:30,451
Yours isn't.

670
00:34:35,467 --> 00:34:37,494
Thank you.

671
00:34:38,874 --> 00:34:42,975
There will be a runabout
standing by.

672
00:34:45,054 --> 00:34:47,491
One to beam up.

673
00:35:21,668 --> 00:35:22,967
Mullibok.

674
00:35:23,005 --> 00:35:24,338
Mullibok.

675
00:35:25,677 --> 00:35:27,010
No!

676
00:35:32,358 --> 00:35:34,659
You're...
you're hurting her.

677
00:35:34,697 --> 00:35:35,996
Let go.

678
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:37,332
Easy.

679
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:38,668
Lussilla...

680
00:35:38,705 --> 00:35:40,504
Easy.

681
00:35:40,543 --> 00:35:45,543
I told you...
take your hands off me.

682
00:35:58,749 --> 00:36:00,982
That's right.

683
00:36:01,021 --> 00:36:03,185
It's okay.

684
00:36:03,226 --> 00:36:06,997
Everything's going to be fine.

685
00:36:07,034 --> 00:36:09,665
Oh...

686
00:36:09,707 --> 00:36:11,677
it's you.

687
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:15,014
You were having a bad dream.

688
00:36:15,052 --> 00:36:19,016
Not just a bad dream...
bad memories.

689
00:36:19,061 --> 00:36:22,364
I didn't say anything,
did I?

690
00:36:22,402 --> 00:36:24,372
No.

691
00:36:24,406 --> 00:36:25,705
You thirsty?

692
00:36:25,742 --> 00:36:27,041
No.

693
00:36:27,078 --> 00:36:28,377
Hungry?

694
00:36:28,415 --> 00:36:30,408
No. Leave me alone.

695
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:34,424
Go back to sleep.

696
00:36:36,399 --> 00:36:37,891
Where you going?

697
00:36:37,935 --> 00:36:41,397
I'd like to get some sleep, too.

698
00:36:41,477 --> 00:36:45,110
Fine, bring the chair over here.

699
00:36:45,151 --> 00:36:47,952
Well, are you my nurse, or not?

700
00:36:55,474 --> 00:36:57,945
Is this better?

701
00:36:57,979 --> 00:37:01,043
Are you going to talk all night?

702
00:37:01,086 --> 00:37:03,421
Let me sleep.

703
00:37:31,587 --> 00:37:33,614
Nog, I'm waiting.

704
00:37:33,658 --> 00:37:35,127
I'm thinking.

705
00:37:35,161 --> 00:37:36,460
About what?

706
00:37:36,498 --> 00:37:39,299
Latinum, and how
we don't have any.

707
00:37:39,337 --> 00:37:41,330
All we have is dirt.

708
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:43,972
How many times do
I have to tell you?

709
00:37:44,015 --> 00:37:45,609
It's not dirt... it's land.

710
00:37:45,651 --> 00:37:48,647
What are we supposed
to do with this land?

711
00:37:48,691 --> 00:37:50,320
Sell it, I guess.

712
00:37:50,361 --> 00:37:51,590
To who?

713
00:37:51,631 --> 00:37:53,498
Why do I have
to think of everything?

714
00:37:53,602 --> 00:37:55,504
We should have kept
the stem bolts.

715
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,337
Land is better than bolts.

716
00:37:57,377 --> 00:37:58,903
How do you know?

717
00:37:58,946 --> 00:38:01,383
You can build things on land.

718
00:38:01,419 --> 00:38:04,016
You can't build anything
without bolts.

719
00:38:05,494 --> 00:38:07,988
Just throw down a card.

720
00:38:11,007 --> 00:38:13,308
And you say they're based
here on the station?

721
00:38:13,345 --> 00:38:14,472
That's correct.

722
00:38:14,581 --> 00:38:16,483
The Noh-Jay Consortium?

723
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:19,924
No, never heard of it.

724
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,189
Why do you ask?

725
00:38:21,229 --> 00:38:22,197
I was contacted

726
00:38:22,231 --> 00:38:24,030
by a government
official this morning.

727
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:26,039
They want to build
a reclamation facility

728
00:38:26,073 --> 00:38:28,510
on a strip of land owned
by four different people.

729
00:38:28,545 --> 00:38:30,846
Three of them
have agreed to sell

730
00:38:30,884 --> 00:38:32,183
but the government

731
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,521
doesn't know
how to reach the fourth...

732
00:38:34,558 --> 00:38:36,187
this Noh-Jay Consortium.

733
00:38:36,229 --> 00:38:38,199
You mean the government
can't build

734
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:40,204
without that one piece of land.

735
00:38:40,238 --> 00:38:41,537
Apparently not.

736
00:38:41,574 --> 00:38:43,875
What a wonderful
opportunity for profit.

737
00:38:43,912 --> 00:38:47,374
I told you that land
was better than bolts.

738
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,946
And you think I'm part
of this Consortium?

739
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:51,154
I think very little
goes on here

740
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:52,824
without your knowledge.

741
00:38:52,865 --> 00:38:55,098
True. This time, however

742
00:38:55,137 --> 00:38:58,167
someone has failed
to include me.

743
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:02,015
Are you telling me
you're not involved?

744
00:39:02,052 --> 00:39:05,959
Oh, not yet,
but that will be remedied.

745
00:39:05,994 --> 00:39:07,930
You can tell the Bajorans

746
00:39:07,965 --> 00:39:11,666
I'll be opening negotiations
with them shortly.

747
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:30,738
Let's see.

748
00:39:30,782 --> 00:39:35,589
Who on this station
is clever enough?

749
00:39:35,626 --> 00:39:36,925
Uncle Quark?

750
00:39:36,962 --> 00:39:38,261
Not now.

751
00:39:38,299 --> 00:39:39,598
But, Uncle Quark...

752
00:39:39,635 --> 00:39:41,264
Go sweep the floor.

753
00:39:41,305 --> 00:39:42,604
It's important.

754
00:39:42,642 --> 00:39:44,612
All right, make it fast.

755
00:39:44,646 --> 00:39:48,951
I have a business opportunity
that might interest you.

756
00:39:48,988 --> 00:39:50,457
Huh?

757
00:39:50,492 --> 00:39:56,165
It'll only cost you five bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

758
00:40:03,181 --> 00:40:05,550
Nog...

759
00:40:57,801 --> 00:40:59,100
Any pain?

760
00:40:59,137 --> 00:41:00,697
Just a little sore.

761
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,713
I was starting to think
you'd sleep all day.

762
00:41:03,747 --> 00:41:07,482
That's because I was taking care
of you all night.

763
00:41:07,522 --> 00:41:12,227
I don't recall
asking you to do that.

764
00:41:12,266 --> 00:41:14,236
I can handle this.

765
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:16,241
Go get something to eat.

766
00:41:16,275 --> 00:41:18,405
There isn't time.

767
00:41:21,954 --> 00:41:24,289
You're finally leaving?

768
00:41:28,368 --> 00:41:30,304
Last one.

769
00:41:43,602 --> 00:41:47,167
I didn't think
I'd ever finish it.

770
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:49,306
It's finished.

771
00:41:49,348 --> 00:41:52,515
Nothing to do but fire it up.

772
00:42:33,545 --> 00:42:35,515
What's all this?

773
00:42:35,549 --> 00:42:37,178
You finished your work.

774
00:42:37,219 --> 00:42:39,520
Now I have to finish mine.

775
00:42:39,558 --> 00:42:41,528
But you don't want to.

776
00:42:41,562 --> 00:42:43,863
I could use a friend on Bajor.

777
00:42:43,901 --> 00:42:45,461
I'd like it to be you.

778
00:42:45,504 --> 00:42:51,815
As long as that cottage
is standing, I stay here.

779
00:42:55,125 --> 00:42:56,890
What the hell are you doing?!

780
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:58,900
Saving your life.

781
00:43:41,962 --> 00:43:45,424
So you chose your uniform
over me after all.

782
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:46,962
That's not true.

783
00:43:47,006 --> 00:43:49,307
The time
I've spent here with you

784
00:43:49,344 --> 00:43:52,111
has meant so much to me,
but it's over.

785
00:43:52,151 --> 00:43:54,782
It's time we went on
with our lives...

786
00:43:54,823 --> 00:43:56,087
mine and yours.

787
00:43:56,126 --> 00:43:59,224
You say you're my friend.

788
00:43:59,266 --> 00:44:01,897
Prove it.

789
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:04,433
Use that weapon on me.

790
00:44:07,451 --> 00:44:10,549
I can't.

791
00:44:10,591 --> 00:44:13,290
If I leave here, I'll die.

792
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:14,594
No, you won't.

793
00:44:14,634 --> 00:44:16,331
I won't let you.

794
00:44:27,495 --> 00:44:29,158
Two to beam up.
