1
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:07,291
Captain's Log, Stardate 50485.2.

2
00:00:07,327 --> 00:00:10,632
I've come to Marva IV,
a planet near the Badlands

3
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,037
to rendezvous with an informer

4
00:00:12,073 --> 00:00:14,375
who claims to have information
on the whereabouts

5
00:00:14,413 --> 00:00:17,251
of the Maquis leader
and former Starfleet officer

6
00:00:17,288 --> 00:00:19,260
Michael Eddington.

7
00:00:34,503 --> 00:00:36,634
Looking for a friend of mine.

8
00:00:40,352 --> 00:00:42,152
His name is Cing'ta.

9
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:12,901
Cing'ta?

10
00:01:16,253 --> 00:01:17,985
Throw it on the ground.

11
00:01:27,953 --> 00:01:29,651
Turn around.

12
00:01:36,175 --> 00:01:37,474
Hello, Captain.

13
00:01:37,512 --> 00:01:38,982
Eddington.

14
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:41,888
Mr. Cing'ta
won't be joining us.

15
00:01:41,925 --> 00:01:45,389
His shuttle had an accident
on the way to this rendezvous.

16
00:01:45,434 --> 00:01:46,801
Is he dead?

17
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:49,642
You just don't understand
the Maquis, do you, Captain?

18
00:01:49,713 --> 00:01:51,742
We're not killers.

19
00:01:51,785 --> 00:01:54,257
Mr. Cing'ta's accident
has marooned him

20
00:01:54,293 --> 00:01:57,233
on a particularly nasty planet
in the Badlands

21
00:01:57,267 --> 00:02:00,105
but I assure you
he's very much alive.

22
00:02:00,142 --> 00:02:01,612
How merciful.

23
00:02:01,646 --> 00:02:04,211
You condemned him
to a slow death.

24
00:02:04,254 --> 00:02:05,621
It's more than he deserved.

25
00:02:05,691 --> 00:02:08,163
He was going
to sell us out to you.

26
00:02:08,198 --> 00:02:09,964
He betrayed us.

27
00:02:10,003 --> 00:02:12,772
Now there's a subject
you know a lot about.

28
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,614
You've been on my tail
for eight months

29
00:02:15,652 --> 00:02:17,145
and now that we're face to face

30
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,751
that's all you have
to say to me?

31
00:02:18,794 --> 00:02:20,492
I will say the rest
at your court-martial.

32
00:02:21,535 --> 00:02:23,335
Tell me, Captain.

33
00:02:23,374 --> 00:02:25,174
What is it
that bothers you more...

34
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:28,415
the fact that I left Starfleet
to fight for a higher cause

35
00:02:28,454 --> 00:02:31,257
or the fact that it happened
on your watch?

36
00:02:31,295 --> 00:02:33,494
You didn't "leave" Starfleet.

37
00:02:33,535 --> 00:02:35,973
If you had, I wouldn't be here.

38
00:02:36,009 --> 00:02:37,946
You betrayed Starfleet.

39
00:02:37,981 --> 00:02:39,815
You used your position
as Security Chief

40
00:02:39,853 --> 00:02:42,486
to feed the Maquis
information about us

41
00:02:42,528 --> 00:02:44,523
and at the same time,
you misled us

42
00:02:44,566 --> 00:02:46,629
with false information
about them.

43
00:02:46,672 --> 00:02:48,506
There is a word for that...

44
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:49,980
treason.

45
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,820
Look out there.

46
00:03:05,157 --> 00:03:08,861
Those people... they were
colonists on Salva II.

47
00:03:08,901 --> 00:03:13,243
They had farms and shops
and homes and schools.

48
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,152
And then one day,
the Federation signed a treaty

49
00:03:16,188 --> 00:03:18,753
and handed their world
over to the Cardassians...

50
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:21,929
just like that.

51
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,739
They made these people
refugees overnight.

52
00:03:24,778 --> 00:03:26,773
It's not that simple
and you know it.

53
00:03:26,884 --> 00:03:29,517
These people don't have
to live here like this.

54
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:31,690
We've offered them resettlement.

55
00:03:31,731 --> 00:03:33,599
They don't want to be resettled.

56
00:03:33,636 --> 00:03:38,206
They want to go home
to the lives they built.

57
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,480
How would you feel

58
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,323
if the Federation gave
your father's home

59
00:03:42,361 --> 00:03:43,728
to the Cardassians?

60
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,330
I'm not here to debate
Federation policy with...

61
00:03:46,372 --> 00:03:49,141
I didn't tell you
to turn around.

62
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,853
Look at them, Captain.

63
00:03:58,741 --> 00:04:02,844
They're humans,
just like you and me

64
00:04:02,885 --> 00:04:05,552
and Starfleet took
everything away from them.

65
00:04:05,593 --> 00:04:09,035
Remember that the next time
you put on that uniform.

66
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:11,804
There's a war out there
and you're on the wrong side.

67
00:04:11,843 --> 00:04:15,547
You know what I see out there,
Mr. Eddington?

68
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:17,023
I see victims

69
00:04:17,058 --> 00:04:21,366
but not of Cardassia
or the Federation.

70
00:04:21,403 --> 00:04:23,271
Victims of you...

71
00:04:23,309 --> 00:04:25,246
the Maquis.

72
00:04:25,281 --> 00:04:27,583
You sold these people
on the dream

73
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,888
that one day they could go back

74
00:04:29,928 --> 00:04:32,731
to those farms and schools
and homes

75
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:34,866
but you know they never can

76
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:37,379
and the longer you keep
that hope alive

77
00:04:37,415 --> 00:04:39,614
the longer these people
will suffer.

78
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,853
Go ahead, shoot me.

79
00:04:43,298 --> 00:04:46,295
Someday, I may
take you up on that.

80
00:04:49,214 --> 00:04:53,420
For now, let me leave you
with one piece of advice.

81
00:04:54,964 --> 00:04:57,129
Don't come after me.

82
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,165
You'll regret it.

83
00:05:03,488 --> 00:05:05,356
Sisko to <i>Defiant.</i>

84
00:05:05,393 --> 00:05:07,261
Eddington just beamed out.

85
00:05:07,299 --> 00:05:09,635
Trace his transporter signal.

86
00:05:09,672 --> 00:05:10,800
We've got it, Captain.

87
00:05:10,842 --> 00:05:12,175
He's on a Maquis raider.

88
00:05:12,213 --> 00:05:14,378
They're breaking orbit
and heading out of the system.

89
00:05:14,418 --> 00:05:16,913
Beam me aboard
and lay in a pursuit course.

90
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,452
All hands to battle stations.

91
00:05:18,497 --> 00:05:19,523
Aye, sir.

92
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:28,047
He's headed for the Badlands,
all right.

93
00:07:28,086 --> 00:07:29,920
Course is zero mark 213.

94
00:07:29,957 --> 00:07:31,187
Commander?

95
00:07:31,227 --> 00:07:34,965
Changing course now
to zero mark 213.

96
00:07:35,005 --> 00:07:36,304
We're on his tail, Captain.

97
00:07:36,341 --> 00:07:37,503
Maximum warp.

98
00:07:37,545 --> 00:07:39,379
How long until we're
in firing range?

99
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,681
22 minutes.

100
00:07:40,787 --> 00:07:42,519
- Major?
- Not good enough.

101
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:43,961
He'll reach the plasma fields

102
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:45,660
two minutes
before we're in range.

103
00:07:45,701 --> 00:07:47,000
We need some help.

104
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,238
What's the position
of the Starship <i>Malinche?</i>

105
00:07:49,278 --> 00:07:52,252
They're on patrol in the DMZ,
near the Gamma 7 outpost.

106
00:07:52,286 --> 00:07:53,482
Hmm. Perfect.

107
00:07:53,523 --> 00:07:56,053
Is the new
holocommunicator ready?

108
00:07:56,097 --> 00:07:58,126
Oh, the Chief's had it on line
for six hours now.

109
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:00,233
I think he's eager for someone
to give it a try.

110
00:08:00,275 --> 00:08:02,372
Always like to please the Chief.

111
00:08:02,414 --> 00:08:05,878
Open a channel to Captain
Sanders on the <i>Malinche.</i>

112
00:08:09,534 --> 00:08:11,300
Are you receiving my image,
Captain?

113
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:13,402
Yes, and you?

114
00:08:13,445 --> 00:08:15,542
You appear to be sitting
on my Bridge.

115
00:08:15,585 --> 00:08:17,921
It may take me a while
to get used to this.

116
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,724
I'm not fond
of uninvited guests.

117
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,733
I'll try not
to overstay my welcome

118
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:23,739
but at the moment
I need your help.

119
00:08:23,775 --> 00:08:25,712
We're in pursuit
of a Maquis raider

120
00:08:25,746 --> 00:08:27,079
headed for the Badlands.

121
00:08:27,117 --> 00:08:28,143
Can you intercept?

122
00:08:28,187 --> 00:08:30,021
You seem pretty eager, Captain.

123
00:08:30,058 --> 00:08:31,892
What did this Maquis raider do?

124
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,332
It's not what they did.

125
00:08:33,368 --> 00:08:34,667
It's who's in command...

126
00:08:34,704 --> 00:08:36,003
Michael Eddington.

127
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:39,176
Ah.
Everyone's favorite traitor.

128
00:08:39,217 --> 00:08:40,881
Captain, if you don't mind...

129
00:08:40,923 --> 00:08:42,359
You want him in your brig.

130
00:08:42,393 --> 00:08:43,521
We'll cut him off.

131
00:08:43,563 --> 00:08:45,033
You can grab him.

132
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:46,731
Sanders out.

133
00:08:46,772 --> 00:08:49,040
The <i>Malinche</i> is
moving to intercept.

134
00:08:49,078 --> 00:08:51,073
Prepare to target
the Maquis ship.

135
00:08:51,117 --> 00:08:53,818
I want to disable them,
but I want them alive.

136
00:08:53,925 --> 00:08:54,825
Understood.

137
00:08:54,928 --> 00:08:57,629
Send a security detachment
to the transporter room.

138
00:08:57,669 --> 00:08:58,831
Have them prepare to...

139
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:01,173
Captain, Eddington's
dropped out of warp.

140
00:09:02,817 --> 00:09:05,085
Go to impulse.
Raise shields.

141
00:09:05,123 --> 00:09:07,254
What is he doing?

142
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,291
He's changed course.

143
00:09:09,335 --> 00:09:10,965
Now he's headed directly for us.

144
00:09:11,007 --> 00:09:12,477
He has locked
his weapons on us.

145
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,037
He's no match for the <i>Defiant.</i>

146
00:09:14,081 --> 00:09:15,779
Is this some kind
of suicide run?

147
00:09:15,819 --> 00:09:16,788
Not Eddington.

148
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:18,086
He's up to something.

149
00:09:18,126 --> 00:09:20,496
Let's not give him a chance
to make his move.

150
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:23,564
Mr. Worf, fire phasers.

151
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,815
Report.

152
00:09:27,853 --> 00:09:30,691
We've got a massive
computer failure.

153
00:09:30,728 --> 00:09:33,429
Every computer system is down...

154
00:09:33,469 --> 00:09:35,269
and all the backups.

155
00:09:35,307 --> 00:09:37,745
We're losing control over...

156
00:09:37,781 --> 00:09:38,875
everything.

157
00:09:38,918 --> 00:09:42,622
Weapons, navigation,
helm, propulsion...

158
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:44,256
Bridge to Engine Room.

159
00:09:45,268 --> 00:09:46,567
Commander, get down there.

160
00:09:46,606 --> 00:09:48,270
Find out what's going on.

161
00:09:48,311 --> 00:09:51,308
Try to route the auxiliary
controls through the...

162
00:09:52,622 --> 00:09:54,058
Before you waste a lot of time

163
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,931
running around trying
to restore computer control

164
00:09:57,001 --> 00:09:59,337
let me save you some trouble.

165
00:09:59,374 --> 00:10:00,844
You can't.

166
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:03,044
You'll find that your memory
cores are completely wiped

167
00:10:03,085 --> 00:10:06,390
and will have to be
reprogrammed from scratch.

168
00:10:06,428 --> 00:10:08,923
These work remarkably well.

169
00:10:08,968 --> 00:10:12,068
Glad we were able
to procure one.

170
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,313
You left a cascade virus
in the <i>Defiant's</i> computers.

171
00:10:15,352 --> 00:10:17,220
Sounds simple, doesn't it?

172
00:10:17,258 --> 00:10:20,232
But I assure you
it took a great deal of time

173
00:10:20,266 --> 00:10:22,899
to devise one
that wouldn't be detected

174
00:10:22,941 --> 00:10:24,571
by Odo or Chief O'Brien.

175
00:10:24,612 --> 00:10:26,641
I'm really quite proud of it.

176
00:10:26,685 --> 00:10:29,318
I'll add it to the list
of charges against you.

177
00:10:29,358 --> 00:10:31,762
Well, as long
as you're making a list

178
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:34,033
why don't you add this?

179
00:10:42,328 --> 00:10:43,992
You know what your problem is,
Captain?

180
00:10:44,033 --> 00:10:45,663
You've made this personal.

181
00:10:45,704 --> 00:10:47,231
It didn't have to be.

182
00:10:47,276 --> 00:10:48,540
It wasn't with me.

183
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:52,180
I have no animosity,
no harsh feelings toward you.

184
00:10:52,222 --> 00:10:54,056
I wish I could say the same.

185
00:10:54,094 --> 00:10:55,496
Does it really pay

186
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:58,369
to risk yourself,
your ship, your crew

187
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,105
on a personal vendetta?

188
00:11:00,178 --> 00:11:02,412
And would Starfleet approve?

189
00:11:02,451 --> 00:11:05,448
I don't need any lectures
about Starfleet from you.

190
00:11:05,492 --> 00:11:07,623
And no matter what happens
here today

191
00:11:07,665 --> 00:11:09,067
it's not over between us.

192
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,973
I'm the one in control here,
Captain.

193
00:11:12,011 --> 00:11:13,914
Your ship is defenseless.

194
00:11:13,949 --> 00:11:16,080
I could destroy you right now

195
00:11:16,155 --> 00:11:17,819
but I won't.

196
00:11:17,861 --> 00:11:21,030
Like I said,
the Maquis aren't killers.

197
00:11:21,069 --> 00:11:24,739
Our quarrel is
with the Cardassians, not you.

198
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,153
Leave us alone
and we'll leave you alone.

199
00:11:30,162 --> 00:11:31,495
Cease fire.

200
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,505
Am I supposed to thank you?

201
00:11:36,546 --> 00:11:38,039
No.

202
00:11:38,084 --> 00:11:41,685
I'm not going to make you
grovel for your life.

203
00:11:41,727 --> 00:11:46,399
Unlike you, Captain,
I know when to walk away.

204
00:11:46,441 --> 00:11:49,176
Maybe you should
think about that...

205
00:11:49,215 --> 00:11:52,246
on your long trip home.

206
00:12:04,917 --> 00:12:08,553
Captain's Log, Stardate 50488.2.

207
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,896
The <i>Defiant</i> has returned
to the station

208
00:12:10,934 --> 00:12:13,338
but not under its own power.

209
00:12:13,374 --> 00:12:16,143
The Starship <i>Malinche</i>
had to tow us home.

210
00:12:16,182 --> 00:12:17,777
We've got our work
cut out for us.

211
00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:19,882
Eddington's cascade
virus disabled

212
00:12:19,926 --> 00:12:21,829
every memory circuit
on the <i>Defiant.</i>

213
00:12:21,865 --> 00:12:23,129
We'll have to reload

214
00:12:23,168 --> 00:12:24,763
and reprogram
the entire database.

215
00:12:24,806 --> 00:12:25,775
How long?

216
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:29,012
Well, if we were at a shipyard
with a space dock and a crew...

217
00:12:29,051 --> 00:12:30,988
We're not.
How long?

218
00:12:31,023 --> 00:12:32,287
Two weeks.

219
00:12:32,327 --> 00:12:33,523
And that's working
with three shifts

220
00:12:33,564 --> 00:12:34,533
'round the clock.

221
00:12:34,566 --> 00:12:36,059
Get started.

222
00:12:36,104 --> 00:12:38,576
If there's any way
you can speed things up...

223
00:12:38,612 --> 00:12:40,446
I'll do what I can.

224
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:45,188
I've removed two similar
cascade viruses

225
00:12:45,229 --> 00:12:47,201
hidden on the station's
main computer.

226
00:12:47,235 --> 00:12:48,899
By transmitting a signal

227
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,846
Eddington could have disabled
our entire defense system.

228
00:12:51,881 --> 00:12:55,551
How long until you've eliminated
all of Eddington's handiwork?

229
00:12:55,592 --> 00:12:56,754
It's a good question.

230
00:12:56,795 --> 00:12:58,595
I can't guarantee
we found all of them.

231
00:12:58,634 --> 00:13:00,606
Eddington was DS9's

232
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,975
Chief of Starfleet Security
for 18 months.

233
00:13:03,012 --> 00:13:05,747
He had the opportunity
to infiltrate and compromise

234
00:13:05,787 --> 00:13:07,154
every system on the station.

235
00:13:07,191 --> 00:13:09,163
Then check every system
on the station.

236
00:13:09,197 --> 00:13:10,690
I intend to.

237
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:15,770
Sir, have you ever reminded
Starfleet Command

238
00:13:15,815 --> 00:13:17,251
that they stationed
Eddington here

239
00:13:17,286 --> 00:13:19,554
because they didn't trust me?

240
00:13:19,592 --> 00:13:20,492
No.

241
00:13:20,528 --> 00:13:21,930
Please do.

242
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,738
What word do you have
from Starfleet Intelligence?

243
00:13:25,776 --> 00:13:26,904
Two Bolian freighters

244
00:13:26,946 --> 00:13:28,883
have disappeared
near the Badlands.

245
00:13:28,918 --> 00:13:31,015
They believe the Maquis
are responsible.

246
00:13:31,058 --> 00:13:32,585
What were
the freighters carrying?

247
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:36,093
Several thousand tons
of selenium and rhodium nitrite.

248
00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:37,973
That's not very valuable cargo.

249
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,776
What would they want with it?

250
00:13:39,816 --> 00:13:41,913
Commander Dax
is analyzing the possibilities.

251
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:42,923
Good.

252
00:13:42,957 --> 00:13:44,393
In the meantime,
help Chief O'Brien

253
00:13:44,429 --> 00:13:45,693
get the <i>Defiant</i> back on line.

254
00:13:45,732 --> 00:13:47,430
I want to get out there
as soon as possible.

255
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,461
Aye, sir.

256
00:13:49,977 --> 00:13:51,344
What can I do for you, Captain?

257
00:13:51,381 --> 00:13:53,980
I don't know quite
how to tell you this

258
00:13:54,022 --> 00:13:55,424
so I'll just say it.

259
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,765
Starfleet Command has given me
a new assignment.

260
00:13:58,802 --> 00:14:00,899
They want me
to bring in Eddington.

261
00:14:00,942 --> 00:14:02,309
Oh, you mean
you've been ordered

262
00:14:02,345 --> 00:14:03,906
to help me bring him in,
don't you?

263
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:06,651
No. Your mission orders
have changed.

264
00:14:06,691 --> 00:14:09,426
Eddington is no longer
your responsibility.

265
00:14:09,465 --> 00:14:12,030
Did they give you a reason?

266
00:14:12,073 --> 00:14:13,600
Well...

267
00:14:13,643 --> 00:14:17,951
you've been after him
for, uh, eight months.

268
00:14:19,393 --> 00:14:22,630
Not to put too fine
a point on it, but...

269
00:14:22,669 --> 00:14:24,641
you haven't gotten the job done.

270
00:14:26,647 --> 00:14:30,488
Look, Captain,
I understand how you feel.

271
00:14:30,558 --> 00:14:32,495
If one of my officers
had fooled me

272
00:14:32,563 --> 00:14:35,093
the way Eddington fooled you,
I...

273
00:14:35,137 --> 00:14:37,005
I'd take it personally, too.

274
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,375
Bad choice of words.

275
00:14:38,413 --> 00:14:39,849
I didn't mean "fooled."

276
00:14:39,883 --> 00:14:41,376
No, you're exactly right.

277
00:14:41,421 --> 00:14:42,720
I was fooled.

278
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:44,422
But it won't happen again.

279
00:14:44,463 --> 00:14:46,058
That's not the issue.

280
00:14:46,101 --> 00:14:47,731
Starfleet also believes

281
00:14:47,772 --> 00:14:51,909
that where Eddington is
concerned, you're vulnerable.

282
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,651
He just knows you too well,
Captain.

283
00:14:54,691 --> 00:14:56,890
So maybe it's time
for someone he doesn't know

284
00:14:56,931 --> 00:14:57,922
to go after him.

285
00:15:04,753 --> 00:15:06,690
Good hunting.

286
00:15:07,728 --> 00:15:09,198
Thank you, Captain.

287
00:15:28,619 --> 00:15:29,815
The good news is

288
00:15:29,856 --> 00:15:31,987
Starfleet Intelligence
is making progress

289
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:34,228
breaking the Maquis
communication codes.

290
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:37,437
The bad news is,
it won't do us any good.

291
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,948
We're out of the game.

292
00:15:38,982 --> 00:15:40,110
But what the hell, right?

293
00:15:40,152 --> 00:15:42,055
You win some, you lose some.

294
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,029
You always had problems

295
00:15:44,063 --> 00:15:45,499
with the "lose some"
part of that.

296
00:15:45,533 --> 00:15:47,596
What can I say, old man?

297
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:48,608
In 25 years of duty

298
00:15:48,642 --> 00:15:50,442
I have never been
taken off an assignment

299
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,471
until now!

300
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,546
Right.

301
00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:55,993
This is about being
taken off the assignment.

302
00:15:56,029 --> 00:15:57,966
It has nothing to do
with a certain

303
00:15:58,002 --> 00:15:59,802
ex-security officer
we both know.

304
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,244
He worked under me
for a year and a half.

305
00:16:02,281 --> 00:16:03,876
I saw him almost every day

306
00:16:03,918 --> 00:16:06,015
read his reports,
had him to dinner.

307
00:16:06,057 --> 00:16:07,618
I even took him
to a baseball game

308
00:16:07,662 --> 00:16:08,631
in the holosuite once

309
00:16:08,698 --> 00:16:09,792
and I never saw it!

310
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:12,502
It's my job to be
a good judge of character

311
00:16:12,542 --> 00:16:13,738
and what did I do?

312
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:16,446
Not only did I not see it,
I put him up for a promotion.

313
00:16:18,225 --> 00:16:20,162
He played his hand well.

314
00:16:20,197 --> 00:16:21,758
He played me, all right.

315
00:16:21,802 --> 00:16:23,432
And what is my excuse?

316
00:16:23,473 --> 00:16:25,205
Is he a changeling?
No.

317
00:16:25,245 --> 00:16:28,881
Is he a being with seven
lifetimes of experience? No.

318
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,687
Is he a wormhole alien?
No.

319
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,891
He's just a man, like me...

320
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,934
and he beat me!

321
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,177
It's good.

322
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,211
"Good"?

323
00:16:42,593 --> 00:16:45,727
It's good you're working it out
on the bag, Benjamin.

324
00:16:45,835 --> 00:16:50,041
Because... you're going
to have to let go of this one.

325
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,484
Eddington is someone
else's problem now

326
00:16:52,521 --> 00:16:54,925
and you're going
to have to live with that.

327
00:16:54,961 --> 00:16:56,328
Ops to Captain Sisko.

328
00:16:56,365 --> 00:16:57,767
What is it, Major?

329
00:16:57,802 --> 00:16:59,329
Sir, you'd better get up here.

330
00:16:59,373 --> 00:17:01,345
There's news
and it's about Eddington.

331
00:17:05,256 --> 00:17:06,988
Report.

332
00:17:07,028 --> 00:17:08,088
Eddington just upped the ante.

333
00:17:08,131 --> 00:17:10,228
He attacked the Cardassian
colony on Veloz Prime

334
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,330
with a biogenic weapon.

335
00:17:11,374 --> 00:17:13,004
What?!

336
00:17:13,045 --> 00:17:15,610
He launched three stratospheric
torpedoes at the planet

337
00:17:15,651 --> 00:17:18,717
and spread cobalt diselenide
throughout the biosphere.

338
00:17:18,761 --> 00:17:21,360
A nerve agent that is
harmless to most humanoids

339
00:17:21,402 --> 00:17:23,339
but it is deadly to Cardassians.

340
00:17:23,373 --> 00:17:24,968
The Cardassians are
already evacuating.

341
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:27,951
And Eddington has announced
that the Maquis intend

342
00:17:27,987 --> 00:17:30,221
to reclaim the planet
once they are gone.

343
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,060
What I don't understand
is where the Maquis

344
00:17:32,098 --> 00:17:34,765
got the materials
to make a biogenic weapon.

345
00:17:34,806 --> 00:17:35,934
I do.

346
00:17:35,975 --> 00:17:38,642
I should have seen it earlier.

347
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:41,213
The selenium
and the rhodium nitrites

348
00:17:41,256 --> 00:17:44,754
they hijacked,
can be reformulated

349
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,040
and with some work, synthesized
to produce...

350
00:17:49,078 --> 00:17:51,073
cobalt diselenide.

351
00:17:51,118 --> 00:17:52,178
Where's the <i>Malinche?</i>

352
00:17:52,221 --> 00:17:54,386
On the other side
of the Badlands.

353
00:17:54,427 --> 00:17:55,521
They're headed
for Veloz Prime now

354
00:17:55,563 --> 00:17:56,623
but by the time
they get there...

355
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,638
Eddington will be long gone.

356
00:17:58,672 --> 00:18:00,472
Given the amount

357
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:02,642
of chemical compounds
Eddington stole

358
00:18:02,683 --> 00:18:05,282
how many of these weapons
will he be able to make?

359
00:18:05,324 --> 00:18:10,270
Enough to poison every
Cardassian colony in the DMZ.

360
00:18:10,305 --> 00:18:12,436
There must something we can do.

361
00:18:12,477 --> 00:18:14,779
Worf, are there any other
starships near Veloz Prime?

362
00:18:14,817 --> 00:18:18,384
The <i>Malinche</i> is our only
ship in the sector.

363
00:18:18,427 --> 00:18:20,992
So unless they stop Eddington...

364
00:18:22,271 --> 00:18:24,139
the Maquis have turned the tide.

365
00:18:24,176 --> 00:18:26,979
There is another ship
in the area.

366
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,989
It's moored at Docking Bay 3.

367
00:18:37,748 --> 00:18:39,309
<i>Defiant.</i>

368
00:18:43,301 --> 00:18:45,067
It's going to be tricky,
Captain.

369
00:18:45,106 --> 00:18:46,872
Only half the systems
are back on line.

370
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,645
And most of those are not
operating at full capacity.

371
00:18:49,685 --> 00:18:50,915
What about the warp drive?

372
00:18:50,956 --> 00:18:52,323
We can go to warp six

373
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:54,661
but the inertial dampers
haven't been fully repaired

374
00:18:54,699 --> 00:18:56,329
so don't expect a smooth ride.

375
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,068
The weapons are also on line

376
00:18:58,108 --> 00:19:01,208
but the targeting scanners
have to be manually calibrated.

377
00:19:01,251 --> 00:19:03,416
We can shoot, but God knows
what we'll hit.

378
00:19:03,457 --> 00:19:04,790
What about communications?

379
00:19:04,828 --> 00:19:06,058
The <i>Defiant's</i> com system

380
00:19:06,098 --> 00:19:08,195
is fried...
and I do mean fried.

381
00:19:08,271 --> 00:19:09,832
Well, we still have
our com badges.

382
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:10,775
I'm afraid not.

383
00:19:10,811 --> 00:19:12,543
They won't work either

384
00:19:12,582 --> 00:19:14,018
not with all the interference

385
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:16,618
from the unshielded
EPS conduits.

386
00:19:16,661 --> 00:19:18,461
Well, what do we use?

387
00:19:18,499 --> 00:19:20,471
Cups and a long string?

388
00:19:20,505 --> 00:19:21,998
We'll have to improvise.

389
00:19:22,042 --> 00:19:24,344
Let me introduce you
to your new com system.

390
00:19:24,382 --> 00:19:25,373
Cadet?

391
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:30,154
Cadet Nog,
reporting as ordered, sir.

392
00:19:30,198 --> 00:19:31,029
Stand easy.

393
00:19:31,068 --> 00:19:34,738
With most of the Bridge control
functions off line

394
00:19:34,777 --> 00:19:38,082
all orders to Engineering
will have to be relayed.

395
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,217
In the interest of clarity,
I thought it best

396
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,596
that those messages be
relayed with one voice.

397
00:19:42,633 --> 00:19:44,764
Mister Academy here.

398
00:19:44,805 --> 00:19:47,506
I figured you'd want somebody
who could hear you

399
00:19:47,547 --> 00:19:49,211
while the Bridge
is exploding all around you.

400
00:19:49,251 --> 00:19:50,515
Exploding?

401
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:53,051
We may be going
into a combat situation.

402
00:19:53,095 --> 00:19:54,588
Do you think you're ready
for that, Cadet?

403
00:19:54,633 --> 00:19:56,628
Sir. Yes, sir.

404
00:19:56,673 --> 00:19:57,903
Absolutely, sir.

405
00:19:57,943 --> 00:19:59,470
I'm glad to hear it.

406
00:19:59,514 --> 00:20:00,778
Report to the Bridge.

407
00:20:00,817 --> 00:20:02,481
Aye, sir.

408
00:20:02,522 --> 00:20:04,619
"Exploding"?

409
00:20:06,132 --> 00:20:08,627
Let me give you
all the bad news at once, sir.

410
00:20:08,672 --> 00:20:11,977
We have no cloak,
no transporters

411
00:20:12,015 --> 00:20:14,180
no replicators,
and the stabilizing gyros

412
00:20:14,221 --> 00:20:16,489
are at only 50 percent.

413
00:20:16,527 --> 00:20:18,259
So don't ask for any sharp turns

414
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,168
unless you want to end up
doing barrel rolls.

415
00:20:20,205 --> 00:20:22,609
That could be fun.

416
00:20:22,645 --> 00:20:24,309
Do you have any good news,
Chief?

417
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:28,726
The new holocommunicator
I installed works perfectly.

418
00:20:28,762 --> 00:20:31,098
Well, let's be thankful
for small favors.

419
00:20:31,136 --> 00:20:32,503
Prepare for departure.

420
00:20:36,685 --> 00:20:37,779
All right, say it.

421
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:38,790
What?

422
00:20:38,823 --> 00:20:40,225
That I have lost all perspective

423
00:20:40,261 --> 00:20:41,891
that I'm turning this
into a vendetta

424
00:20:41,932 --> 00:20:43,334
between me and Eddington

425
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:45,433
and that I am putting
the ship, the crew

426
00:20:45,475 --> 00:20:46,945
and my entire career at risk

427
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,677
and if I had any brains at all

428
00:20:48,718 --> 00:20:50,713
I'd go back to my office,
sit down

429
00:20:50,757 --> 00:20:52,956
and read Odo's crime reports.

430
00:20:52,996 --> 00:20:54,968
I wasn't going to say that.

431
00:20:55,001 --> 00:20:56,767
But that's what you
were thinking, right?

432
00:20:56,807 --> 00:20:58,641
No.

433
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:02,121
Actually,
what I was thinking is...

434
00:21:02,155 --> 00:21:05,996
you're becoming more like Curzon
all the time.

435
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:08,562
I don't know how to take that.

436
00:21:08,607 --> 00:21:10,271
Consider it a compliment.

437
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:11,941
And the next time I go off

438
00:21:11,983 --> 00:21:14,182
half-cocked
on some wild-eyed adventure

439
00:21:14,222 --> 00:21:16,353
think back to this moment

440
00:21:16,395 --> 00:21:18,263
and be a little more
understanding.

441
00:21:32,105 --> 00:21:34,543
Recalibrate phaser banks
one and two.

442
00:21:34,646 --> 00:21:38,019
Initialize starboard
and port thrusters.

443
00:21:38,056 --> 00:21:40,290
Captain, Ops has cleared us
for departure.

444
00:21:40,329 --> 00:21:41,298
Very well.

445
00:21:41,332 --> 00:21:43,030
Engine Room,
stand by impulse power.

446
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,369
Engine Room, Bridge.

447
00:21:44,406 --> 00:21:47,540
- Stand by impulse power.
- Stand by impulse power.

448
00:21:47,582 --> 00:21:49,577
Stand by to increase
deuterium injection rate.

449
00:21:49,622 --> 00:21:50,591
Standing by...

450
00:21:50,657 --> 00:21:53,061
Configure driver coils
for impulse speed.

451
00:21:53,098 --> 00:21:54,534
Processing configuration.

452
00:21:54,569 --> 00:21:56,768
Set EPS taps at level three.

453
00:21:56,808 --> 00:21:57,799
Ops.

454
00:21:57,844 --> 00:22:00,146
Seal the airlock
and release docking clamps.

455
00:22:00,184 --> 00:22:01,483
Close exterior hatches.

456
00:22:01,521 --> 00:22:03,458
Depressurize the airlock.

457
00:22:03,494 --> 00:22:06,525
Detach umbilicals,
clear all moorings.

458
00:22:06,568 --> 00:22:08,129
Thrusters at station keeping.

459
00:22:08,173 --> 00:22:10,168
Initialize deflector field.

460
00:22:10,212 --> 00:22:12,080
Docking clamps released.

461
00:22:12,117 --> 00:22:14,112
Helm, ease us out.

462
00:22:14,157 --> 00:22:16,722
Port and starboard thrusters
at one-quarter.

463
00:22:16,763 --> 00:22:18,427
Bearing 180 mark zero.

464
00:22:23,015 --> 00:22:26,184
Distance from docking ring:
50 meters.

465
00:22:26,223 --> 00:22:27,317
Sixty.

466
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,329
Seventy.

467
00:22:28,363 --> 00:22:29,332
Eighty.

468
00:22:29,366 --> 00:22:30,392
Bring us about, old man.

469
00:22:30,435 --> 00:22:31,404
Hard to port.

470
00:22:31,438 --> 00:22:32,600
Ten degrees pitch.

471
00:22:32,641 --> 00:22:34,636
Minimal power to aft thrusters.

472
00:22:34,714 --> 00:22:37,152
Let the momentum
bring us around.

473
00:22:45,477 --> 00:22:46,947
Hold at five degrees pitch.

474
00:22:46,982 --> 00:22:48,144
We're coming around too fast.

475
00:22:48,185 --> 00:22:49,587
I see it.

476
00:22:49,622 --> 00:22:51,286
Ease off on the port thrusters.

477
00:22:51,327 --> 00:22:53,161
Pitch back to zero degrees.

478
00:22:58,781 --> 00:23:01,414
Pulse starboard thrusters,
point-five-second bursts.

479
00:23:01,456 --> 00:23:03,986
Engine Room,
helm control is sluggish.

480
00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:06,024
Realign the navigational gyros.

481
00:23:06,068 --> 00:23:07,936
...Realign navigational gyros.

482
00:23:07,973 --> 00:23:09,203
Port thruster,
two second burst.

483
00:23:09,244 --> 00:23:10,213
Double pulse port thruster.

484
00:23:10,246 --> 00:23:13,049
Helm, I hope you see that pylon.

485
00:23:13,088 --> 00:23:15,287
Bow thrusters,
pitch up 16 degrees.

486
00:23:15,328 --> 00:23:16,821
Full power to port thrusters.

487
00:23:16,865 --> 00:23:18,631
Half roll... now.

488
00:23:26,893 --> 00:23:27,987
Engine Room.

489
00:23:28,029 --> 00:23:29,431
One-quarter impulse power.

490
00:23:29,467 --> 00:23:30,663
Engine Room, Bridge.

491
00:23:30,703 --> 00:23:32,002
One-quarter impulse power.

492
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:34,240
Helm, lay in a course
for the Badlands.

493
00:23:34,281 --> 00:23:36,253
Engine Room,
stand by for warp speed.

494
00:23:36,286 --> 00:23:37,881
Set intermix to point zero-one.

495
00:23:37,924 --> 00:23:40,158
Initialize warp
chamber on my mark.

496
00:23:40,197 --> 00:23:42,396
Three, two, one.

497
00:23:42,436 --> 00:23:43,427
Mark.

498
00:23:46,047 --> 00:23:47,073
Warp one, sir.

499
00:23:47,116 --> 00:23:49,452
Engine Room,
increase speed to warp six

500
00:23:49,489 --> 00:23:50,515
as soon as possible.

501
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,154
...to warp six
as soon as possible.

502
00:23:53,768 --> 00:23:55,899
Sir, Engine Room reports

503
00:23:55,941 --> 00:23:57,205
we could go to warp seven.

504
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:01,419
Well done, people.

505
00:24:01,457 --> 00:24:04,488
Mr. Worf, I think
we should start running

506
00:24:04,531 --> 00:24:06,503
battle drills.

507
00:24:06,537 --> 00:24:07,973
Aye, sir.

508
00:24:08,008 --> 00:24:10,412
Captain's Log, supplemental.

509
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:12,443
After completing a series
of readiness drills

510
00:24:12,487 --> 00:24:14,789
we've entered the plasma fields
of the Badlands

511
00:24:14,861 --> 00:24:17,026
and begun our search
for Eddington.

512
00:24:18,036 --> 00:24:19,130
Steady as she goes.

513
00:24:19,172 --> 00:24:20,266
Watch those gyros.

514
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:22,246
Check the status of torpedoes
three and four.

515
00:24:22,281 --> 00:24:25,654
We have an energy variance
on the plasma warheads.

516
00:24:25,691 --> 00:24:27,355
Transfer power from the...

517
00:24:27,395 --> 00:24:29,298
Forward scanners are
still not functioning.

518
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:31,238
Engine Room, where are
those field stabilizers?

519
00:24:31,273 --> 00:24:32,367
Engine Room, Bridge.

520
00:24:32,409 --> 00:24:34,312
Where are those
field stabilizers?

521
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:37,688
Major, Engine Room
reports field stabilizers

522
00:24:37,725 --> 00:24:40,129
should be on line
in 15 minutes.

523
00:24:40,164 --> 00:24:42,295
Oh, I've got something.

524
00:24:42,337 --> 00:24:45,744
It's a small neutrino signature,
bearing...

525
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,252
218 mark 135.

526
00:24:48,287 --> 00:24:51,490
Distance...
approximately 900 kilometers.

527
00:24:51,529 --> 00:24:53,397
It's moving.

528
00:24:53,435 --> 00:24:55,133
It's a Maquis raider.

529
00:24:55,173 --> 00:24:57,908
Helm, set intercept course.

530
00:24:58,014 --> 00:24:59,575
Engine Room,
three-quarter impulse.

531
00:24:59,619 --> 00:25:01,419
Engine Room,
three-quarter impulse.

532
00:25:01,457 --> 00:25:03,759
Incoming transmission
from the Maquis raider.

533
00:25:03,798 --> 00:25:05,770
It's Eddington.

534
00:25:05,803 --> 00:25:07,239
Put him through.

535
00:25:09,212 --> 00:25:11,548
Well, well, Mr. Eddington.

536
00:25:12,722 --> 00:25:14,386
You just couldn't resist
the temptation

537
00:25:14,427 --> 00:25:16,022
to come after me,
could you, Captain?

538
00:25:16,065 --> 00:25:17,831
I like to finish what I start.

539
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:20,206
Well, I'm afraid you're going
to be disappointed...

540
00:25:20,243 --> 00:25:21,212
again.

541
00:25:21,246 --> 00:25:22,579
You won't get me, Captain.

542
00:25:22,616 --> 00:25:25,887
But I do have
a consolation prize for you.

543
00:25:25,925 --> 00:25:28,227
Actually, it's more of a gift.

544
00:25:28,265 --> 00:25:30,294
Incoming transmission.

545
00:25:30,338 --> 00:25:32,833
Sending over a document.

546
00:25:32,879 --> 00:25:34,041
It's a book.

547
00:25:34,082 --> 00:25:35,916
One of my favorites.

548
00:25:35,953 --> 00:25:37,320
<i>Les Misérables.</i>

549
00:25:37,358 --> 00:25:39,090
Thank you, but I've read it.

550
00:25:39,129 --> 00:25:40,223
Recently?

551
00:25:40,266 --> 00:25:42,431
If not, you should
read it again.

552
00:25:42,472 --> 00:25:44,102
Pay close attention

553
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:46,479
to the character
of Inspector Javert...

554
00:25:46,516 --> 00:25:49,855
the French policeman who spends
20 years chasing a man

555
00:25:49,892 --> 00:25:52,262
for stealing a loaf of bread.

556
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,001
Sound like anyone you know?

557
00:25:55,107 --> 00:25:58,743
Why don't you beam over
and we'll discuss it?

558
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,687
Captain, closing
on the Maquis ship.

559
00:26:00,723 --> 00:26:02,284
700 kilometers.

560
00:26:02,328 --> 00:26:03,821
Ready weapons.

561
00:26:03,864 --> 00:26:05,425
Phaser banks charged.

562
00:26:05,469 --> 00:26:06,962
Lock target.

563
00:26:07,007 --> 00:26:08,237
Locked.

564
00:26:08,277 --> 00:26:09,337
It's over, Eddington.

565
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,750
Why don't you surrender
your vessel

566
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:13,621
and prepare to be boarded?

567
00:26:13,659 --> 00:26:16,497
It's a tempting offer,
but I have other plans.

568
00:26:17,503 --> 00:26:19,269
Enjoy the book.

569
00:26:22,317 --> 00:26:25,953
Sir, the neutrino readings
are dissipating.

570
00:26:25,993 --> 00:26:27,691
It's not a ship.

571
00:26:27,731 --> 00:26:28,961
It's an unmanned probe

572
00:26:29,002 --> 00:26:31,497
set to transmit
a false warp signature.

573
00:26:31,542 --> 00:26:33,844
He wanted to lure us here.

574
00:26:33,882 --> 00:26:35,716
Why?

575
00:26:35,754 --> 00:26:38,056
He's up to something...
outside the plasma fields.

576
00:26:41,102 --> 00:26:43,667
Helm, bring us about.
Get us out of here.

577
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,838
Engines at full impulse.

578
00:26:44,879 --> 00:26:46,075
Engine Room, Bridge...

579
00:26:46,149 --> 00:26:47,710
Hard to port.
Full thrusters.

580
00:26:47,754 --> 00:26:49,885
Course 180 mark zero.

581
00:26:56,345 --> 00:26:58,213
Sir, Chief O'Brien
doesn't recommend

582
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,688
increasing velocity
through the plasma fields.

583
00:27:00,724 --> 00:27:01,693
Objection noted.

584
00:27:01,726 --> 00:27:03,059
Now get me more speed.

585
00:27:03,164 --> 00:27:04,930
Engine Room, Bridge.
More speed.

586
00:27:07,978 --> 00:27:10,027
Sir, picking up
a distress signal.

587
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,132
It's the Starship <i>Malinche.</i>

588
00:27:13,268 --> 00:27:15,798
They've been ambushed
by the Maquis.

589
00:27:17,447 --> 00:27:19,008
It's dead in space.

590
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:41,209
How can we help you, Captain?

591
00:27:41,246 --> 00:27:44,186
Our warp core matrix
compositor is fused.

592
00:27:44,222 --> 00:27:46,855
Our navigational systems
are disabled.

593
00:27:46,896 --> 00:27:50,303
If you could spare
some micro-power relays

594
00:27:50,339 --> 00:27:52,504
we should have the engines
back on line in a day or two.

595
00:27:52,578 --> 00:27:53,706
Engine Room.

596
00:27:53,748 --> 00:27:56,449
Beam a damage control team
to the <i>Malinche.</i>

597
00:27:56,489 --> 00:28:00,125
Tell them to take along
a dozen micro-power relays.

598
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:01,226
Engine Room...

599
00:28:01,269 --> 00:28:03,902
We got a distress signal
from a Cardassian freighter.

600
00:28:03,943 --> 00:28:05,436
They'd just been attacked
by the Maquis.

601
00:28:05,481 --> 00:28:07,953
Suffered some casualties.

602
00:28:07,988 --> 00:28:10,483
Our sensors confirmed
what we were being told

603
00:28:10,528 --> 00:28:11,622
but when we lowered the shields

604
00:28:11,665 --> 00:28:13,499
to transport
some of the wounded...

605
00:28:13,536 --> 00:28:16,031
The sensor readings
had been faked.

606
00:28:16,077 --> 00:28:17,843
There were no Cardassians
on that freighter.

607
00:28:17,882 --> 00:28:20,879
The Maquis had rigged it
with a focused particle beam

608
00:28:20,924 --> 00:28:22,485
that punched
through our gyro shielding

609
00:28:22,529 --> 00:28:23,520
and we lost helm control.

610
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:25,160
And by the time we got
back on our feet again

611
00:28:25,202 --> 00:28:27,801
three Maquis raiders
came out of the plasma field.

612
00:28:30,518 --> 00:28:32,421
Well...

613
00:28:32,456 --> 00:28:36,490
it seems I couldn't get the job
done either, Captain.

614
00:28:36,535 --> 00:28:38,267
It's not over.

615
00:28:38,306 --> 00:28:41,007
I figured you'd
be going after him.

616
00:28:41,047 --> 00:28:44,181
We have something
that might be useful to you.

617
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:48,360
We intercepted a coded message
from one of Eddington's raiders.

618
00:28:48,401 --> 00:28:50,099
Maybe you can decode it.

619
00:28:50,139 --> 00:28:51,609
Our, uh, computers
are still down.

620
00:28:51,677 --> 00:28:52,805
I appreciate it.

621
00:28:52,847 --> 00:28:55,319
Do me a favor?

622
00:28:55,354 --> 00:28:56,151
Of course.

623
00:28:56,189 --> 00:28:57,488
Save me a seat

624
00:28:57,526 --> 00:28:59,725
at his court-martial.

625
00:29:01,303 --> 00:29:02,933
Count on it.

626
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:04,970
Good hunting, Captain.

627
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:14,432
Captain's Log, supplemental.

628
00:29:14,474 --> 00:29:17,505
With the <i>Defiant's</i> computers
still not fully operational

629
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:20,021
we're relying on Odo,
back at Deep Space 9

630
00:29:20,056 --> 00:29:21,822
to decipher the Maquis message.

631
00:29:21,861 --> 00:29:25,030
In the meantime,
we're combing the DMZ

632
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:27,600
in the hopes of a chance
encounter with Eddington

633
00:29:27,644 --> 00:29:31,017
but with each passing hour,
our hopes are fading.

634
00:29:31,054 --> 00:29:32,387
Sir, incoming transmission.

635
00:29:32,424 --> 00:29:33,415
It's Odo.

636
00:29:34,463 --> 00:29:36,435
Captain.

637
00:29:36,468 --> 00:29:39,671
Odo, we need
some good news around here.

638
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:41,408
Tell me that you have some.

639
00:29:41,449 --> 00:29:42,679
Possibly.

640
00:29:42,786 --> 00:29:45,088
I've analyzed
the Maquis message.

641
00:29:45,126 --> 00:29:46,926
And?

642
00:29:46,964 --> 00:29:49,699
It appears to be a simple
Breen nursery rhyme.

643
00:29:49,805 --> 00:29:51,708
A heterophonic,
five-line verse.

644
00:29:51,778 --> 00:29:53,750
Quite a catchy one, too.

645
00:29:56,491 --> 00:29:57,858
What does it mean?

646
00:29:57,895 --> 00:29:59,262
Well, metrical analysis

647
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:02,570
shows an alternating tetrameter
and pentameter structure

648
00:30:02,608 --> 00:30:05,674
but the computer could find no
meaningful pattern in the words.

649
00:30:05,717 --> 00:30:07,415
They appear to be
just what they are...

650
00:30:07,455 --> 00:30:11,421
nonsensical phrases strung
together because they rhyme...

651
00:30:11,466 --> 00:30:13,130
at least to the Breen.

652
00:30:13,171 --> 00:30:14,367
And the music?

653
00:30:14,408 --> 00:30:16,607
It's written on a Lyxian scale.

654
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,551
I ran it
through the computer, too.

655
00:30:18,586 --> 00:30:19,885
No meaningful pattern.

656
00:30:19,924 --> 00:30:21,622
So we're nowhere.

657
00:30:21,662 --> 00:30:22,790
Now, I wouldn't say that.

658
00:30:22,898 --> 00:30:26,203
You see, I remembered something
that Eddington once said to me.

659
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:30,150
"The best place to hide
something is in plain sight."

660
00:30:30,185 --> 00:30:34,322
And since this is
a Breen nursery rhyme...

661
00:30:34,363 --> 00:30:37,827
So you think that Eddington
is using the music as a signal

662
00:30:37,907 --> 00:30:39,810
for a rendezvous
in the Breen system?

663
00:30:39,845 --> 00:30:41,041
Or a Breen settlement

664
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:45,117
like the one on Portas V,
which isn't far from the DMZ.

665
00:30:45,161 --> 00:30:48,295
The biogenic components of the
weapons Eddington's been using

666
00:30:48,336 --> 00:30:50,365
are very bulky
and very unstable.

667
00:30:50,408 --> 00:30:51,775
They need to be kept

668
00:30:51,813 --> 00:30:54,616
in a large, sophisticated
cold-storage unit.

669
00:30:54,654 --> 00:30:58,118
And if anyone knows how to keep
things cold, it's the Breen.

670
00:30:59,501 --> 00:31:00,731
Thank you, Odo.

671
00:31:00,771 --> 00:31:02,104
Captain.

672
00:31:06,788 --> 00:31:12,498
Mr. Worf, do we have a series
of sensor relays near Portas V?

673
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,836
Yes, sir.

674
00:31:13,874 --> 00:31:15,811
Two class-5 intelligence drones.

675
00:31:15,846 --> 00:31:17,977
Pull their sensor logs.

676
00:31:18,019 --> 00:31:21,085
I want to see who's been
visiting the Breen system.

677
00:31:22,365 --> 00:31:24,860
Captain's Log, supplemental.

678
00:31:24,905 --> 00:31:26,877
Odo's hunch has proven accurate.

679
00:31:26,911 --> 00:31:29,383
Our intelligence drones
detected a Maquis freighter

680
00:31:29,417 --> 00:31:31,514
entering Portas V
three hours ago.

681
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:32,924
The freighter was last seen

682
00:31:33,028 --> 00:31:36,025
headed into the Dorvan sector
of the DMZ.

683
00:31:36,069 --> 00:31:39,043
Considering the freighter's
range, velocity and heading

684
00:31:39,078 --> 00:31:42,247
Eddington's next target is one
of four Cardassian colonies.

685
00:31:42,287 --> 00:31:43,620
But...

686
00:31:43,657 --> 00:31:46,928
these targets are unlikely.

687
00:31:46,967 --> 00:31:49,269
Their defense systems
were recently upgraded

688
00:31:49,306 --> 00:31:50,605
by the Cardassians.

689
00:31:50,644 --> 00:31:51,738
Hmm.

690
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,345
Eddington isn't looking
for a fight.

691
00:31:54,387 --> 00:31:57,658
That leaves only Quatal
and Panora.

692
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,926
Quatal has a lucrative

693
00:31:58,966 --> 00:32:01,769
mining operation,
and their weapon systems

694
00:32:01,808 --> 00:32:03,506
are in the process
of being upgraded

695
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:05,950
but they're not
fully operational.

696
00:32:06,053 --> 00:32:07,683
A tempting target.

697
00:32:07,724 --> 00:32:08,818
Not as tempting as Panora.

698
00:32:08,861 --> 00:32:10,958
The Maquis attacked
them two months ago.

699
00:32:11,034 --> 00:32:13,735
And most of their defense
systems were severely damaged.

700
00:32:13,775 --> 00:32:14,903
They're almost helpless.

701
00:32:14,944 --> 00:32:17,509
And there are constant
ion storms in that system...

702
00:32:17,552 --> 00:32:18,816
good places to hide

703
00:32:18,855 --> 00:32:20,723
if you want to mount
a surprise attack.

704
00:32:20,761 --> 00:32:22,527
A tactic Eddington knows well.

705
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:25,563
Panora is a more logical
target than Quatal.

706
00:32:25,607 --> 00:32:27,875
Then Eddington will attack
Quatal.

707
00:32:27,914 --> 00:32:28,883
Sir?

708
00:32:28,917 --> 00:32:30,912
He likes being unpredictable.

709
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,670
Approaching Quatal Prime.

710
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:38,938
Slow to impulse power.

711
00:32:38,978 --> 00:32:39,947
Full scan.

712
00:32:39,981 --> 00:32:41,849
Activate parabolic
sensor arrays.

713
00:32:41,887 --> 00:32:44,359
Initiate lateral scanners.

714
00:32:44,393 --> 00:32:46,227
We're too late, Captain.

715
00:32:46,265 --> 00:32:48,760
Eddington's detonated
his weapon.

716
00:32:48,806 --> 00:32:50,299
The nerve agent
is already spreading

717
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:51,871
through the planet's atmosphere.

718
00:32:51,915 --> 00:32:53,715
Which means the
Cardassians don't have

719
00:32:53,753 --> 00:32:55,348
much time to get away.

720
00:32:55,391 --> 00:32:57,488
Eddington's always
one step ahead of us.

721
00:32:57,531 --> 00:32:59,263
Maybe not this time.

722
00:32:59,302 --> 00:33:00,932
I'm reading residual
neutrino levels.

723
00:33:00,973 --> 00:33:03,207
Looks like one,
maybe two Maquis raiders

724
00:33:03,246 --> 00:33:04,648
behind the fourth moon.

725
00:33:04,684 --> 00:33:05,744
They're on the run.

726
00:33:05,787 --> 00:33:06,881
Go after them.
Full impulse.

727
00:33:06,924 --> 00:33:08,690
Engine Room, Bridge.
Full impulse.

728
00:33:08,728 --> 00:33:09,856
On screen.
Shields up.

729
00:33:09,898 --> 00:33:11,026
Charge phaser banks.

730
00:33:11,068 --> 00:33:12,504
Aye, sir.

731
00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:14,032
How long to intercept?

732
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:15,045
15 seconds.

733
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:16,446
Prepare to lock targets.

734
00:33:16,483 --> 00:33:18,249
Targeting sequence on...

735
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:19,484
Hard to port.

736
00:33:19,525 --> 00:33:21,462
Stick with this one, old man.

737
00:33:21,497 --> 00:33:22,693
They've locked phasers on us.

738
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,729
Power to forward shields.

739
00:33:24,773 --> 00:33:26,836
Forward shields, on line.

740
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:27,848
Restabilize port and...

741
00:33:27,882 --> 00:33:28,816
Lock target.

742
00:33:28,851 --> 00:33:31,119
Targeting scanners...
synchronized.

743
00:33:31,191 --> 00:33:32,160
Fire!

744
00:33:33,364 --> 00:33:35,666
Helm, bring us about.

745
00:33:35,703 --> 00:33:37,264
One more to go.

746
00:33:41,988 --> 00:33:44,723
Sir, this one's making
another run for the planet.

747
00:33:44,763 --> 00:33:46,894
I don't get it... they've
already poisoned the atmosphere.

748
00:33:48,406 --> 00:33:49,500
More speed.

749
00:33:49,542 --> 00:33:50,875
Engine Room, Bridge.
More speed.

750
00:33:50,913 --> 00:33:53,443
They've locked phasers
on one of the transport ships

751
00:33:53,486 --> 00:33:54,888
evacuating the Cardassians.

752
00:34:02,445 --> 00:34:04,143
They've disabled the transport.

753
00:34:04,217 --> 00:34:05,778
It's losing power.

754
00:34:05,821 --> 00:34:07,257
It's going down.

755
00:34:07,292 --> 00:34:08,488
Can we beam the crew off?

756
00:34:08,528 --> 00:34:09,588
We're out of transporter range.

757
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:11,261
Incoming transmission.

758
00:34:15,047 --> 00:34:17,110
Well, Javert...

759
00:34:17,153 --> 00:34:19,854
let's see how deep
your obsession with me is.

760
00:34:19,894 --> 00:34:21,124
You've got me.

761
00:34:21,164 --> 00:34:24,537
I can't outrun or outfight
the <i>Defiant,</i> but...

762
00:34:24,573 --> 00:34:27,776
if you come after me,
you'll have to pay a price...

763
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:31,349
you'll have to let
all those helpless Cardassians

764
00:34:31,392 --> 00:34:33,864
spiral down to their deaths.

765
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,768
The choice is yours.

766
00:34:37,977 --> 00:34:39,241
How long do they have?

767
00:34:39,315 --> 00:34:40,511
Two minutes to impact.

768
00:34:40,552 --> 00:34:41,680
Not much time.

769
00:34:41,721 --> 00:34:44,091
Probably take you
at least a minute

770
00:34:44,128 --> 00:34:45,826
to get back to the planet.

771
00:34:45,866 --> 00:34:47,598
They're just Cardassians.

772
00:34:49,911 --> 00:34:51,848
Helm, bring us about.

773
00:34:51,883 --> 00:34:53,581
Prepare to engage tractor beam.

774
00:34:53,621 --> 00:34:55,148
Initializing tractor beam.

775
00:34:55,192 --> 00:34:56,422
Aligning induction field.

776
00:34:56,462 --> 00:34:57,989
Alignment complete.

777
00:35:31,652 --> 00:35:34,182
We've towed the transport ship

778
00:35:34,225 --> 00:35:36,697
out of the planet's
gravitational pull.

779
00:35:36,732 --> 00:35:38,966
Once our repair team
is back on board

780
00:35:39,005 --> 00:35:40,908
release the tractor beam.

781
00:35:40,943 --> 00:35:43,108
The Cardassians can
limp their way home

782
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,449
in a day or two.

783
00:35:48,398 --> 00:35:49,731
<i>Les Misérables?</i>

784
00:35:49,768 --> 00:35:51,101
You know it?

785
00:35:51,139 --> 00:35:53,704
I can't stand Victor Hugo.

786
00:35:53,746 --> 00:35:57,210
I tried reading
<i>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</i>

787
00:35:57,256 --> 00:35:59,855
but I couldn't get through it.

788
00:35:59,896 --> 00:36:02,198
It was so melodramatic

789
00:36:02,237 --> 00:36:05,838
and his heroines are
so two-dimensional.

790
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,481
Eddington compares me
to one of the characters...

791
00:36:09,524 --> 00:36:11,358
Inspector Javert...

792
00:36:11,396 --> 00:36:15,499
a policeman who
relentlessly pursues

793
00:36:15,608 --> 00:36:18,080
a man named Valjean.

794
00:36:18,114 --> 00:36:20,382
Guilty of a trivial offense.

795
00:36:20,421 --> 00:36:22,825
And in the end

796
00:36:22,861 --> 00:36:26,394
Javert's own inflexibility
destroys him.

797
00:36:26,438 --> 00:36:27,999
He commits suicide.

798
00:36:28,042 --> 00:36:31,815
You can't believe
that description fits you.

799
00:36:31,853 --> 00:36:36,195
Eddington is just trying
to... get under your skin.

800
00:36:36,232 --> 00:36:38,466
He did that eight months ago.

801
00:36:40,276 --> 00:36:43,774
What strikes me about this book

802
00:36:43,819 --> 00:36:46,816
is that Eddington said that
it's one of his favorites.

803
00:36:46,862 --> 00:36:49,266
There's no accounting for taste.

804
00:36:49,301 --> 00:36:52,139
Oh, let's think about it.

805
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:55,983
A Starfleet security officer
is fascinated

806
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:59,963
by a nineteenth-century
French melodrama, and now

807
00:36:59,998 --> 00:37:02,368
he's a leader of the Maquis...
a resistance group

808
00:37:02,405 --> 00:37:06,576
fighting the noble battle
against the "evil" Cardassians.

809
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:09,521
It sounds like he's living out
his own fantasy.

810
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:10,585
Mm-hmm.

811
00:37:10,627 --> 00:37:12,393
Exactly.

812
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,599
And you know what?

813
00:37:15,709 --> 00:37:19,482
<i>Les Misérables</i> isn't
about the policeman.

814
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:26,768
It's about Valjean... the victim
of a monstrous injustice

815
00:37:26,807 --> 00:37:29,645
who spends his entire
life helping people.

816
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:33,885
Making noble sacrifices
for others.

817
00:37:36,835 --> 00:37:39,809
That's how Eddington
sees himself.

818
00:37:39,843 --> 00:37:41,838
He's Valjean.

819
00:37:41,882 --> 00:37:44,116
He's Robin Hood.

820
00:37:44,155 --> 00:37:47,859
He's a romantic, dashing figure

821
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:51,807
fighting the good fight
against insurmountable odds.

822
00:37:51,843 --> 00:37:54,578
The secret life
of Michael Eddington.

823
00:37:56,088 --> 00:37:57,718
How does it help us?

824
00:37:57,826 --> 00:38:01,633
Well, Eddington is the hero
of his own story.

825
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:04,337
That makes me the villain.

826
00:38:04,378 --> 00:38:07,045
And what is it
that every hero wants to do?

827
00:38:07,086 --> 00:38:09,320
Kill the bad guy.

828
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:10,988
Ah, that's part of it.

829
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:13,502
Heroes only kill
when they have to.

830
00:38:13,536 --> 00:38:16,135
Eddington could have killed me
back at the refugee camp

831
00:38:16,177 --> 00:38:18,513
or when he disabled the <i>Defiant</i>

832
00:38:18,551 --> 00:38:23,395
but, in the best melodramas,
the villain creates a situation

833
00:38:23,431 --> 00:38:26,565
where the hero is forced
to sacrifice himself

834
00:38:26,607 --> 00:38:30,607
for the people, for the cause...
one final, grand gesture.

835
00:38:30,651 --> 00:38:32,451
What are you getting at,
Benjamin?

836
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:36,867
I think it's time
for me to become the villain.

837
00:38:38,641 --> 00:38:41,206
Commander.

838
00:38:41,247 --> 00:38:43,583
Prepare two quantum torpedoes.

839
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:45,889
Have Engineering
attach a cargo pod

840
00:38:45,928 --> 00:38:49,461
with 200 kilograms of trilithium
to each torpedo.

841
00:38:49,504 --> 00:38:51,168
Yes, sir, but...

842
00:38:51,209 --> 00:38:52,269
But what?

843
00:38:52,312 --> 00:38:53,907
The extra mass of a cargo pod

844
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:56,286
will make the torpedo
less effective.

845
00:38:56,323 --> 00:38:59,526
Maquis raiders are small
and maneuverable.

846
00:38:59,565 --> 00:39:02,334
I'm not planning to fire
at any ships, Mr. Worf.

847
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:03,342
Major.

848
00:39:03,376 --> 00:39:05,644
What is the nearest
Maquis colony?

849
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,554
Solosos III.
Less than an hour away.

850
00:39:09,593 --> 00:39:11,120
Helm, set a course
for Solosos III.

851
00:39:11,164 --> 00:39:12,133
Aye, sir.

852
00:39:12,167 --> 00:39:13,603
Major, I want you to send

853
00:39:13,638 --> 00:39:16,544
the following message
on all Maquis frequencies.

854
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:19,987
"To all the members
of the Maquis resistance.

855
00:39:20,023 --> 00:39:23,328
"This is Captain Sisko
of the USS <i>Defiant.</i>

856
00:39:23,365 --> 00:39:26,932
"In response to the Maquis' use
of biogenic weapons

857
00:39:26,975 --> 00:39:28,171
"in their recent attacks

858
00:39:28,212 --> 00:39:31,015
"I am about to take
the following action.

859
00:39:31,054 --> 00:39:32,182
"In exactly one hour

860
00:39:32,223 --> 00:39:34,354
I will detonate
two quantum torpedoes

861
00:39:34,396 --> 00:39:36,868
"that will scatter trilithium
resin into the atmosphere

862
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:39,033
"of Solosos III.

863
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:41,412
"I thereby will make
the planet uninhabitable

864
00:39:41,449 --> 00:39:45,050
"to all human life
for the next 50 years.

865
00:39:45,093 --> 00:39:48,763
I suggest evacuation plans
begin immediately."

866
00:39:57,962 --> 00:39:59,660
What are you
waiting for, people?

867
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,672
Carry out your orders.

868
00:40:17,784 --> 00:40:19,618
Set torpedo targets
to 50 kilometers

869
00:40:19,656 --> 00:40:20,647
above ground level.

870
00:40:20,692 --> 00:40:21,661
Aye, sir.

871
00:40:21,695 --> 00:40:23,894
Lock.
Ready, Captain.

872
00:40:23,935 --> 00:40:24,904
Time?

873
00:40:24,938 --> 00:40:25,998
One minute left.

874
00:40:26,041 --> 00:40:27,568
And still no transport ship
activity

875
00:40:27,611 --> 00:40:29,708
or any other sign
they're beginning to evacuate.

876
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:33,523
Commander Worf, prepare
to fire torpedoes on my mark.

877
00:40:33,561 --> 00:40:35,863
Detach safeties
on torpedoes one and two.

878
00:40:35,901 --> 00:40:37,394
Incoming transmission.

879
00:40:37,439 --> 00:40:38,601
It's Eddington.

880
00:40:41,751 --> 00:40:44,486
What are you really
up to, Javert?

881
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:46,292
Do you expect me to believe

882
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:48,802
that a decorated
Starfleet officer...

883
00:40:48,838 --> 00:40:50,068
the pride of the service...

884
00:40:50,141 --> 00:40:51,907
is going to poison
an entire planet?

885
00:40:51,946 --> 00:40:54,418
That's exactly
what I'm going to do.

886
00:40:55,422 --> 00:40:56,858
You're bluffing.

887
00:40:56,893 --> 00:40:59,195
Am I?

888
00:40:59,233 --> 00:41:02,367
Commander, launch torpedoes.

889
00:41:08,191 --> 00:41:11,964
Commander, I said
launch torpedoes.

890
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:13,997
Aye, sir.

891
00:41:25,641 --> 00:41:27,670
The trilithium resin

892
00:41:27,712 --> 00:41:29,741
is dissipating
throughout the biosphere.

893
00:41:29,785 --> 00:41:31,757
The Maquis are scrambling
their transport ships.

894
00:41:31,791 --> 00:41:32,919
They're starting
to evacuate.

895
00:41:32,961 --> 00:41:34,260
Do you realize what you've done?

896
00:41:34,298 --> 00:41:35,392
I've only just begun.

897
00:41:35,434 --> 00:41:38,876
I'm going to eliminate
every Maquis colony

898
00:41:38,911 --> 00:41:40,278
in the DMZ.

899
00:41:40,315 --> 00:41:42,845
You're talking about turning
hundreds of thousands of people

900
00:41:42,889 --> 00:41:43,880
into homeless refugees.

901
00:41:43,925 --> 00:41:45,258
That's right.

902
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:48,167
When you attacked the <i>Malinche,</i>
you proved one thing...

903
00:41:48,203 --> 00:41:51,041
that the Maquis have become
an intolerable threat

904
00:41:51,078 --> 00:41:52,946
to the security
of the Federation

905
00:41:52,983 --> 00:41:55,319
and I am going
to eliminate that threat.

906
00:41:55,357 --> 00:41:57,294
But think about those people
you saw in the caves

907
00:41:57,329 --> 00:41:58,298
huddled and starving.

908
00:41:58,331 --> 00:41:59,801
They didn't attack the <i>Malinche.</i>

909
00:41:59,836 --> 00:42:01,203
You should have thought
about that

910
00:42:01,307 --> 00:42:03,141
before you attacked
a Federation starship.

911
00:42:04,248 --> 00:42:07,086
Helm, lay in a course
for Tracken II, warp six.

912
00:42:07,123 --> 00:42:09,425
Commander, prepare
two more torpedoes.

913
00:42:09,462 --> 00:42:10,556
Engine Room, Bridge.

914
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:11,761
Set course 050 mark 179.

915
00:42:11,803 --> 00:42:13,968
Unlock safeties
on torpedoes three and four.

916
00:42:15,179 --> 00:42:16,979
Can't you see
what's happening to you?

917
00:42:17,017 --> 00:42:20,151
You're going against everything
you claim to believe in.

918
00:42:20,193 --> 00:42:21,720
And for what?

919
00:42:21,764 --> 00:42:23,827
To satisfy a personal vendetta?

920
00:42:23,869 --> 00:42:25,396
You betrayed your uniform!

921
00:42:25,441 --> 00:42:27,879
And you're betraying yours,
right now.

922
00:42:27,915 --> 00:42:30,912
The sad part is,
you don't even realize it.

923
00:42:32,895 --> 00:42:34,992
I feel sorry for you, Captain.

924
00:42:35,034 --> 00:42:38,738
This obsession with me...
look what it's cost you.

925
00:42:38,778 --> 00:42:40,408
Major!
Shut that thing off.

926
00:42:40,449 --> 00:42:43,082
Commander Worf,
prepare to launch torpedoes.

927
00:42:43,123 --> 00:42:43,818
Wait!

928
00:42:48,706 --> 00:42:50,701
Lf...

929
00:42:50,745 --> 00:42:53,548
you call off your attack

930
00:42:53,586 --> 00:42:56,617
I'll turn over
all our biogenic weapons.

931
00:42:56,661 --> 00:42:57,960
Not enough.

932
00:43:04,617 --> 00:43:07,147
All right, Javert.

933
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:10,393
I'll give you what you want...

934
00:43:12,338 --> 00:43:14,310
me.

935
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:30,555
Captain's Log, supplemental.

936
00:43:30,589 --> 00:43:33,792
Resettlement efforts
in the DMZ are underway.

937
00:43:33,832 --> 00:43:35,598
The Cardassian
and Maquis colonists

938
00:43:35,637 --> 00:43:37,198
who were forced
to abandon their homes

939
00:43:37,241 --> 00:43:39,041
will make new lives
for themselves

940
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:41,449
on the planets
their counterparts evacuated.

941
00:43:41,487 --> 00:43:43,857
The balance in the region
will be restored

942
00:43:43,893 --> 00:43:46,696
though the situation
remains far from stable.

943
00:43:46,734 --> 00:43:48,865
Captain. Commander.

944
00:43:48,907 --> 00:43:49,967
Welcome home.

945
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:51,309
It's good to be back.

946
00:43:51,347 --> 00:43:54,150
I gather your trip
was productive.

947
00:44:02,378 --> 00:44:04,646
Constable.

948
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:05,880
This way.

949
00:44:12,741 --> 00:44:15,009
Benjamin, I'm curious.

950
00:44:15,047 --> 00:44:18,511
Your plan to poison
the Maquis planets...

951
00:44:18,556 --> 00:44:21,121
you didn't clear it
with Starfleet first, did you?

952
00:44:21,164 --> 00:44:23,534
I knew I'd forgotten
to do something.

953
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:25,667
Ah. Big gamble.

954
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:28,309
That's what it takes
to be a good villain.

955
00:44:28,351 --> 00:44:32,124
You know, sometimes I like it
when the bad guy wins.
