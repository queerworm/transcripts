00:00:01,836 --> 00:00:05,923
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 50485.2.</i>

2
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:09,092
<i>I've come to Marva IV,</i>
<i>a planet near the Badlands</i>

3
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:11,219
<i>to rendezvous</i>
<i>with an informer</i>

4
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,472
<i>who claims to have information</i>
<i>on the whereabouts</i>

5
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:15,933
<i>of the Maquis leader</i>
<i>and former Starfleet officer,</i>

6
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:17,977
<i>Michael Eddington.</i>

7
00:00:18,978 --> 00:00:21,605
(<i> electrical crackling</i> )

8
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:35,160
Looking for a friend of mine.

9
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,791
His name is Cing'ta.

10
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:11,488
(<i> whispering</i> ):
Cing'ta?

11
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:16,577
Throw it
on the ground.

12
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,584
(<i> weapon thuds to ground</i> )

13
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,129
Turn around.

14
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:37,138
Hello, Captain.
Eddington.

15
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:40,099
Mr. Cing'ta
won't be joining us.

16
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:43,812
His shuttle had an accident
on the way to this rendezvous.

17
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:44,939
Is he dead?

18
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,398
You just don't
understand

19
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:47,858
the Maquis, do you, Captain?

20
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:49,860
We're not killers.

21
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,571
Mr. Cing'ta's accident
has marooned him

22
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:55,490
on a particularly nasty planet
in the Badlands,

23
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,410
but I assure you
he's very much alive.

24
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,995
How merciful.

25
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:02,581
You condemned him
to a slow death.

26
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:03,832
It's more than he deserved.

27
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,585
He was going
to sell us out to you.

28
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:08,629
He betrayed us.

29
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:11,924
Now there's a subject
<i>you</i> know a<i> lot</i> about.

30
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:13,842
You've been on my tail
for eight months,

31
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,385
and now that we're face to face,

32
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,929
that's all you have
to say to me?

33
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:18,973
I will say the rest
at your court-martial.

34
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:21,683
Tell me, Captain.

35
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,435
What is it
that bothers you more--

36
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:26,772
the fact that I left Starfleet
to fight for a higher cause

37
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:29,566
or the fact that it happened
on your watch?

38
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,777
You didn't "leave" Starfleet.

39
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:34,279
If you had,
I wouldn't be here.

40
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,197
You betrayed Starfleet.

41
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,950
You used your position
as Security Chief

42
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,786
to feed the Maquis
information about us,

43
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,830
and at the same time,
you misled us

44
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,999
with false information
about them.

45
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:48,251
There is a word for that--
treason.

46
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,047
Look out there.

47
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:07,021
Those people-- they were
colonists on Salva II.

48
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:09,898
They had farms
and shops and homes

49
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,483
and schools.

50
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:14,361
And then one day,
the Federation signed a treaty

51
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:17,031
and handed their world
over to the Cardassians--

52
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:20,075
just like that.

53
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,828
They made these people
refugees overnight.

54
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:24,997
It's not that simple
and you know it.

55
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:27,875
These people don't have
to live here like this.

56
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,085
We've offered them resettlement.

57
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:31,920
They don't want to be resettled.

58
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,422
They want to go home
to the lives they built.

59
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:37,676
How would you feel

60
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:40,179
if the Federation gave
your father's home

61
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:42,014
to the Cardassians?

62
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:44,474
I'm not here to debate
Federation policy with--

63
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,394
I didn't tell<i> you</i>
to turn around.

64
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,023
Look at them, Captain.

65
00:03:56,945 --> 00:04:00,949
They're humans,
just like you and me,

66
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,869
and Starfleet took
everything away from them.

67
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:07,122
Remember that the next time
you put on that uniform.

68
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:09,875
There's a war out there
and you're on the wrong side.

69
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:13,879
You know what I see out there,
Mr. Eddington?

70
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,714
I see victims,

71
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:19,676
but not of Cardassia
or the Federation.

72
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,553
Victims of you--

73
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,471
the Maquis.

74
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,933
You sold these people
on the dream

75
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,935
that one day they could go back

76
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:31,063
to those farms and schools
and homes,

77
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:33,023
but you know they never can,

78
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:35,650
and the longer you keep
that hope alive,

79
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,860
the longer these people

80
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,903
will suffer.

81
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:40,239
Go ahead, shoot me.

82
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,534
Someday, I may
take you up on that.

83
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:51,666
For now, let me leave you
with one piece of advice.

84
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,212
Don't come after me.

85
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,338
You'll regret it.

86
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,595
Sisko to<i> Defiant.</i>

87
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,472
Eddington just beamed out.

88
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,808
Trace his transporter signal.

89
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,143
KIRA:
We've got it, Captain.

90
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:11,019
He's on a Maquis raider.

91
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,896
They're breaking orbit
and heading out of the system.

92
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,023
Beam me aboard
and lay in a pursuit course.

93
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,691
All hands to battle stations.

94
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,818
Aye, sir.

95
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,321
He's headed for the
Badlands, all right.

96
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:29,490
Course is zero mark 213.
Commander?

97
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,370
Changing course now
to zero mark 213.

98
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,872
We're on his tail,
Captain.
Maximum warp.

99
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,749
How long until we're
in firing range?

100
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,209
22 minutes.

101
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,877
Major?
Not good enough.

102
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,379
He'll reach the plasma fields

103
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,089
two minutes
before we're in range.

104
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,799
We need some help.

105
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,884
What's the position
of the Starship<i> Malinche?</i>

106
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,553
They're on patrol in the DMZ,
near the Gamma 7 outpost.

107
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:51,846
Hmm. Perfect.

108
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:54,224
Is the new
holocommunicator ready?

109
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,310
Oh, the Chief's had it on line
for six hours now.

110
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,561
I think he's eager for someone
to give it a try.

111
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,855
Always like to please the Chief.

112
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,066
Open a channel
to Captain Sanders

113
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,401
on the<i> Malinche.</i>

114
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,697
Are you receiving
my image, Captain?

115
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,825
Yes, and you?

116
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,910
You appear to be sitting
on my bridge.

117
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,413
It may take me a while
to get used to this.

118
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,165
I'm not fond
of uninvited guests.

119
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,167
I'll try not
to overstay my welcome,

120
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,127
but at the moment
I need your help.

121
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:24,171
We're in pursuit
of a Maquis raider

122
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:25,339
headed for the Badlands.

123
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:26,465
Can you intercept?

124
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:28,549
You seem pretty eager, Captain.

125
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,344
What did this Maquis raider do?

126
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:31,594
It's not what they did.

127
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,054
It's who's in command--

128
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,389
Michael Eddington.

129
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:37,392
Ah.
Everyone's favorite traitor.

130
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,311
Captain, if you don't mind--

131
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:40,603
You want him in your brig.

132
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,855
We'll cut him off.

133
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,482
You can grab him.

134
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:45,108
Sanders out.

135
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,486
KIRA:
The<i> Malinche</i> is
moving to intercept.

136
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:49,529
Prepare to target
the Maquis ship.

137
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,115
I want to disable them,
but I want them alive.

138
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,659
Understood.
Send a security
detachment

139
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,287
to the transporter room.
Have them prepare to--

140
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,622
Captain, Eddington's
dropped out of warp.

141
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,543
Go to impulse.
Raise shields.

142
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,504
What is he doing?

143
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:07,506
He's changed course.

144
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:09,341
Now he's headed
directly for us.

145
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:10,717
WORF:
He has locked
his weapons on us.

146
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,386
He's no match
for the<i> Defiant.</i>

147
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:14,012
Is this some kind
of suicide run?

148
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:16,390
Not Eddington.
He's up to something.

149
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,683
Let's not give him a chance
to make his move.

150
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,853
Mr. Worf,
fire phasers.

151
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,397
(<i> alarms beeping</i> )

152
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,024
Report.

153
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:29,027
We've got a massive
computer failure.

154
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,654
Every computer system is down...

155
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,407
and all the backups.

156
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,658
We're losing control over...

157
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,202
everything.

158
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:40,872
Weapons, navigation,
helm, propulsion...

159
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,874
Bridge to Engine Room.

160
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,751
Commander,
get down there.

161
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,336
Find out
what's going on.

162
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:49,506
Try to route the auxiliary
controls through the--

163
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,467
Before you waste
a lot of time

164
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:55,136
running around
trying to restore
computer control,

165
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:58,973
let me save you some trouble.
You can't.

166
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,351
You'll find that your memory
cores are completely wiped

167
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:02,394
and will have to be

168
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:04,521
reprogrammed
from scratch.

169
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:07,107
These work remarkably well.

170
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:10,277
Glad we were able
to procure one.

171
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:13,363
You left a cascade virus
in the<i> Defiant's</i> computers.

172
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,490
Sounds simple, doesn't it?

173
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,410
But I assure you
it took a great deal of time

174
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,121
to devise one
that wouldn't be detected

175
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,663
by Odo or Chief O'Brien.

176
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,749
I'm really quite proud of it.

177
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,544
I'll add it to the list
of charges against you.

178
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,921
Well, as long
as you're making a list,

179
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,299
why don't you add this?

180
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:40,557
(<i> explosions</i> )

181
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,142
You know what your
problem is, Captain?

182
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,726
You've made this personal.

183
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,437
It didn't have to be.

184
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:47,314
It wasn't with me.

185
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:50,400
I have no animosity,
no harsh feelings toward you.

186
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,235
I wish I could say the same.

187
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:53,820
Does it really pay

188
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,656
to risk yourself,
your ship, your crew,

189
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,325
on a personal vendetta?

190
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,535
And would Starfleet approve?

191
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:03,455
I don't need any lectures
about Starfleet from you.

192
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,706
And no matter what happens
here today,

193
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,292
it's not over between us.

194
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:10,170
I'm the one in control here,
Captain.

195
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,088
Your ship is defenseless.

196
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,341
I could destroy you right now,

197
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:15,842
but I won't.

198
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:19,137
Like I said,
the Maquis aren't killers.

199
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:22,723
Our quarrel is
with the Cardassians, not you.

200
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:26,353
Leave us alone
and we'll leave you alone.

201
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,313
(<i> explosion</i> )

202
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,564
Cease fire.

203
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:34,528
Am I supposed to thank you?

204
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,070
No.

205
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,658
I'm not going to make you
grovel for your life.

206
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:44,579
Unlike you, Captain,
I know when to walk away.

207
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:47,374
Maybe you should
think about that...

208
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:50,251
on your long trip<i> home.</i>

209
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:06,476
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 50488.2.</i>

210
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,978
<i>The</i> Defiant<i> has returned</i>
<i>to the station,</i>

211
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,481
<i>but not under its own power.</i>

212
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:14,150
<i>The Starship</i> Malinche
<i>had to tow us home.</i>

213
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,694
We've got our work
cut out for us.

214
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:17,945
Eddington's cascade
virus disabled

215
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,864
every memory circuit
on the<i> Defiant.</i>

216
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,408
We'll have to reload

217
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,784
and reprogram
the entire database.
How long?

218
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,453
Well, if we were
at a shipyard

219
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,497
with a space dock
and a crew--

220
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:30,333
We're not.
How long?
Two weeks.

221
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,711
And that's working
with three shifts
'round the clock.

222
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:34,421
Get started.

223
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,715
If there's any way
you can speed things up...

224
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:38,633
I'll do what I can.

225
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,137
I've removed two similar
cascade viruses

226
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,265
hidden on the station's
main computer.

227
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,807
By transmitting a signal,

228
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:47,975
Eddington could
have disabled

229
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:50,437
our entire
defense system.

230
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:53,398
How long until you've eliminated
all of Eddington's handiwork?

231
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:54,815
It's a good question.

232
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,317
I can't guarantee
we found all of them.

233
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,361
Eddington
was DS9's

234
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,655
Chief of Starfleet Security
for 18 months.

235
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,366
He had the opportunity
to infiltrate and compromise

236
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:04,951
every system
on the station.

237
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,953
Then check every system
on the station.

238
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,330
I intend to.

239
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:13,376
Sir, have you ever reminded
Starfleet Command

240
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,002
that they stationed
Eddington here

241
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,338
because they didn't trust me?

242
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:20,592
No.
Please do.

243
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:23,386
What word do you have
from Starfleet Intelligence?

244
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:24,971
Two Bolian freighters

245
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,931
have disappeared
near the Badlands.

246
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,683
They believe the Maquis
are responsible.

247
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,393
What were
the freighters carrying?

248
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:33,812
Several thousand tons
of selenium and rhodium nitrite.

249
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,649
That's not very valuable cargo.

250
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,358
What would they want with it?

251
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,444
Commander Dax
is analyzing the possibilities.

252
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:42,155
Good. In the meantime,
help Chief O'Brien

253
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,531
get the<i> Defiant</i> back on line.

254
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,241
I want to get out there
as soon as possible.

255
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,160
Aye, sir.

256
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,953
What can I do
for you, Captain?

257
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,623
I don't know quite
how to tell you this,

258
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:53,082
so I'll just say it.

259
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,917
Starfleet Command
has given me

260
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,252
a new assignment.

261
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,379
They want me
to bring in Eddington.

262
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,922
Oh, you mean
you've been ordered

263
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,549
to help me bring him in,
don't you?

264
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,427
No. Your mission orders
have changed.

265
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:07,221
Eddington is no longer
your responsibility.

266
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,766
Did they give you a reason?

267
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,309
Well...

268
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:15,647
you've been after him
for, uh, eight months.

269
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:20,443
Not to put too fine
a point on it, but...

270
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,487
you haven't gotten the job done.

271
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,490
Look, Captain,

272
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,201
I understand
how you feel.

273
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,203
If one of my officers
had fooled me

274
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,706
the way Eddington
fooled you, I...

275
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,624
I'd take it personally, too.

276
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,083
Bad choice of words.

277
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,377
I didn't mean "fooled."

278
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,086
No, you're exactly right.

279
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,463
I was fooled.

280
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,089
But it won't happen again.

281
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,717
That's not the issue.

282
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,426
Starfleet also believes

283
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,428
that where Eddington
is concerned,

284
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,389
you're vulnerable.

285
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:52,225
He just knows you
too well, Captain.

286
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,477
So maybe it's time
for someone he doesn't know

287
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:55,520
to go after him.

288
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,529
Good hunting.

289
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:06,906
Thank you, Captain.

290
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,594
DAX:
The good news is

291
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,554
Starfleet Intelligence
is making progress

292
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:31,806
breaking the Maquis
communication codes.

293
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:35,101
The bad news is,
it won't do us any good.

294
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,477
We're out of the game.

295
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,687
But what the hell,
right?

296
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,440
You win some,
you lose some.

297
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,150
You always had problems
with the "lose some"
part of that.

298
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,236
What can I say,
old man?

299
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:48,030
In 25 years of duty,
I have never been
taken off an assignment

300
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,409
until now!
Right.

301
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:53,494
This is about being
taken off the assignment.

302
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,371
It has nothing to do
with a certain

303
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,498
ex-security officer
we both know.

304
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,834
He worked under me
for a year and a half.

305
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,669
I saw him almost every day,

306
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,588
read his reports,
had him to dinner.

307
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,339
I even took him
to a baseball game

308
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,508
in the holosuite once,
and I never saw it!

309
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,677
It's my job to be
a good judge of character,

310
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,471
and what did I do?

311
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:14,140
Not only did I not see it,
I put him up for a promotion.

312
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,769
He played his hand well.

313
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,520
He played me, all right.

314
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,063
And what is my excuse?

315
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,774
Is he a changeling?
No.

316
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:26,569
Is he a being with seven
lifetimes of experience? No.

317
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,362
Is he a wormhole alien?
No.

318
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,573
He's just a man, like me...

319
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:33,701
(<i> yells</i> )
and he<i> beat</i> me!

320
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,747
It's good.

321
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:40,040
"Good"?

322
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,377
It's good you're working it out
on the bag, Benjamin.

323
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:47,465
Because... you're going
to have to let go of this one.

324
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:49,968
Eddington is someone
else's problem now,

325
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:52,512
and you're going
to have to live with that.

326
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:53,888
KIRA:
Ops to Captain Sisko.

327
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:55,348
What is it, Major?

328
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,266
Sir, you'd better get up here.

329
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,019
There's news
and it's about Eddington.

330
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,231
Report.

331
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,108
Eddington just
upped the ante.

332
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,777
He attacked the Cardassian
colony on Veloz Prime

333
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:08,945
with a biogenic weapon.

334
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,738
What?!

335
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,157
He launched three stratospheric
torpedoes at the planet

336
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:16,369
and spread cobalt diselenide
throughout the biosphere.

337
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,913
A nerve agent that is
harmless to most humanoids,

338
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,707
but it is deadly
to Cardassians.

339
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,583
WORF:
The Cardassians are
already evacuating.

340
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,545
And Eddington has announced
that the Maquis intend

341
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,672
to reclaim the planet
once they are gone.

342
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,757
What I don't understand
is where the Maquis

343
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,426
got the materials
to make a biogenic weapon.

344
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,594
I do.

345
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,222
I should have seen
it earlier.

346
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,599
The selenium
and the rhodium nitrites

347
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:42,269
they hijacked,
can be reformulated

348
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,355
and with some work,
synthesized

349
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,691
to produce...

350
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,359
cobalt diselenide.

351
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,652
Where's the<i> Malinche?</i>

352
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,487
On the other side
of the Badlands.

353
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,697
They're headed
for Veloz Prime now

354
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:53,823
but by the time
they get there...

355
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,867
Eddington will be long gone.

356
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,618
Given the amount

357
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,829
of chemical compounds
Eddington stole,

358
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:02,373
how many of these weapons
will he be able to make?

359
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:07,461
Enough to poison every
Cardassian colony in the DMZ.

360
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,547
There must something we can do.

361
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:12,050
Worf, are there any other
starships near Veloz Prime?

362
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:15,553
The<i> Malinche</i> is our only
ship in the sector.

363
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:18,347
So unless
they stop Eddington...

364
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,392
the Maquis
have turned the tide.

365
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:24,311
There is another ship
in the area.

366
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:28,315
It's moored at Docking Bay 3.

367
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:36,449
<i>Defiant.</i>

368
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,955
It's going to be tricky,
Captain.

369
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,706
Only half the systems
are back on line.

370
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,374
And most of those
are not operating

371
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,417
at full capacity.

372
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:47,794
What about the warp drive?

373
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,670
We can go to warp six,

374
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,380
but the inertial dampers
haven't been fully repaired

375
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,215
so don't expect
a smooth ride.

376
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,926
The weapons are also
on line,

377
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:56,094
but the targeting scanners

378
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:58,054
have to be manually
calibrated.

379
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:00,347
We can shoot, but God knows
what we'll hit.

380
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,599
What about communications?

381
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:02,892
The<i> Defiant's</i>
com system

382
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,185
is fried--
and I do mean fried.

383
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,604
Well, we still have
our com badges.

384
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:09,315
I'm afraid not.
They won't work either,

385
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:10,817
not with all the interference

386
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,402
from the unshielded
EPS conduits.

387
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,363
Well, what<i> do</i> we use?
Cups and a long string?

388
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,783
O'BRIEN:
We'll have to improvise.

389
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:21,327
Let me introduce you
to your new com system.

390
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,369
Cadet?

391
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:27,041
Cadet Nog,
reporting as ordered, sir.

392
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,002
Stand easy.

393
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:31,420
With most of the bridge control
functions off line,

394
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,924
all orders to Engineering
will have to be relayed.

395
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:37,010
In the interest of clarity,
I thought it best

396
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,595
that those messages be
relayed with one voice.

397
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,722
Mr. Academy here.

398
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,391
I figured you'd
want somebody
who could<i> hear</i> you

399
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,060
while the bridge
is exploding all around you.

400
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,770
Exploding?

401
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,772
We may be going into
a combat situation.

402
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,524
Do you think you're ready
for that, cadet?

403
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,609
Sir. Yes, sir.

404
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,610
Absolutely, sir.

405
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,362
I'm glad to hear it.

406
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:57,488
Report to the bridge.

407
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:59,281
Aye, sir.

408
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,492
(<i> quietly</i> ):
"Exploding"?

409
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:05,454
Let me give you
all the bad news at once, sir.

410
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:08,624
We have no cloak,
no transporters,

411
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,002
no replicators, and
the stabilizing gyros

412
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:13,337
are at only 50 percent.

413
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,964
So don't ask for any sharp turns

414
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:16,966
unless you want to end up
doing barrel rolls.

415
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:19,385
That could be fun.

416
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,054
Do you have any
good news, Chief?

417
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:25,474
The new holocommunicator
I installed works perfectly.

418
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,810
Well, let's be thankful
for small favors.

419
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,353
Prepare for departure.

420
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:35,401
All right, say it.
What?

421
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:36,819
That I have lost
all perspective,

422
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:38,529
that I'm turning this
into a vendetta

423
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:39,989
between me and Eddington,

424
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,200
and that I am putting
the ship, the crew,

425
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,492
and my entire career
at risk,

426
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,452
and if I had
any brains at all,

427
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,413
I'd go back to
my office, sit down,

428
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,540
and read Odo's
crime reports.

429
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,458
I wasn't going
to say that.

430
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,627
But that's what you
were thinking, right?

431
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,337
No.

432
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:58,674
Actually,
what I was thinking is...

433
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:02,636
you're becoming more like Curzon
all the time.

434
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,223
I don't know how to take<i> that.</i>

435
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:07,016
Consider it a compliment.

436
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:08,517
And the next time<i> I</i> go off

437
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,895
half-cocked
on some wild-eyed adventure,

438
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:13,022
think back
to this moment,

439
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:15,024
and be a little more
understanding.

440
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:31,331
WORF:
Recalibrate phaser banks
one and two.

441
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:34,627
DAX:
Initialize starboard
and port thrusters.

442
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,796
Captain, Ops has cleared us
for departure.

443
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:39,673
Very well.
Engine Room, stand
by impulse power.

444
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,092
Engine room, bridge.

445
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:42,635
Stand by impulse power.

446
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,178
Stand by impulse power.

447
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:45,930
Stand by to increase
deuterium injection rate.

Processing

451
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,437
Set EPS taps at level three.

452
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:56,732
Ops. Seal the airlock and
release docking clamps.

453
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,151
KIRA:
Close exterior hatches.

454
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:00,027
Depressurize the airlock.

455
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:03,239
Detach umbilicals,
clear all moorings.

456
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:04,782
SISKO:
Thrusters at
station keeping.

457
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,826
Initialize deflector field.

458
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,619

00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,499
Port and starboard thrusters
at one-quarter.

461
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,168
Bearing 180 mark zero.

462
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,800
Distance from docking ring:
50 meters.

463
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,010
Sixty.

464
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,011
Seventy.

465
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:26,012
Eighty.

466
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:26,971
Bring us about, old man.

467
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,055
DAX:
Hard to port.

468
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,307
Ten degrees pitch.

469
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:31,391
Minimal power to aft thrusters.

470
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:33,769
Let the momentum
bring us around.

471
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,654
Hold at five degrees pitch.

472
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:44,697
We're coming around
too fast.

473
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,157
I see it.

474
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:47,867
Ease off on the
port thrusters.

475
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,743
Pitch back to zero degrees.

476
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,918
Pulse starboard thrusters,
point-five-second bursts.

477
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,754
Engine Room,
helm control is sluggish.

478
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,506
Realign the navigational gyros.

Helm,
I hope you see that pylon.

483
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,891
Bow thrusters,
pitch up 16 degrees.

484
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,559
Full power to port thrusters.

485
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,353
Half roll... now.

Helm, lay in a course
for the Badlands.

491

Engine room,
stand by for warp speed.

00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:34,496
Set intermix

Well done, people.

502
00:23:57,895 --> 00:24:01,107
Mr. Worf, I think
we should start running

503
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:03,109
battle drills.

504
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:04,277

00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,042
It's Eddington.

530
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,377
Put him through.

531
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:07,798
Well, well, Mr. Eddington.

532
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:10,426
You just couldn't resist
the temptation

533
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,303
to come after me,
could you, Captain?

534
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:14,472
I like to finish what I start.

535
00:25:14,472 --> 00:25:16,390
Well, I'm afraid you're going
to be disappointed...

536
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,642
again.
You won't get me, Captain.

537
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:21,979
But I do have
a consolation prize for you.

538
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:24,564
Actually, it's more
of a gift.

539
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:26,400
KIRA:
Incoming transmission.

540
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,986
Sending over a document.

541
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:30,279
It's a book.

542
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:32,156
One of my favorites.

543
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:33,324
<i>Les Misérables.</i>

544
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:35,326
Thank you, but I've read it.

545
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:36,869
Recently?

546
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,496
If not, you should
read it again.

547
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:40,289
Pay close attention

548
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:42,500
to the character
of Inspector Javert--

549
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,003
the French policeman who spends
20 years chasing a man

550
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:48,506
for stealing a loaf of bread.

551
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:51,133
Sound like anyone you know?

552
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:54,803
Why don't you beam over
and we'll discuss it?

553
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,805
Captain, closing
on the Maquis ship.

554
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,516
700 kilometers.

555
00:25:58,516 --> 00:25:59,933
Ready weapons.

556
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,519
Phaser banks charged.

557
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:03,187
Lock target.

558
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:04,480
WORF:
Locked.

559
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,440
SISKO:
It's over, Eddington.

560
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,900
Why don't you surrender
your vessel

561
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,651
and prepare to be boarded?

562
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:12,612
It's a tempting offer,
but I have other plans.

563
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:15,573
Enjoy the book.

564
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,494
(<i> console beeping</i> )

565
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:22,122
Sir, the neutrino readings
are dissipating.

566
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,749
It's not a ship.

567
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,125
It's an unmanned probe,

568
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,545
set to transmit
a false warp signature.

569
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:30,005
He wanted to lure us here.

570
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,673
Why?

571
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,260
He's up to something--
outside the plasma fields.

572
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,681
Helm, bring us about.
Get us out of here.

573
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:42,142
Engines at full impulse.
NOG:
Engine Room, Bridge...

574
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,769
DAX:
Hard to port.
Full thrusters.

575
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:46,021
Course 180 mark zero.

576
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:54,363
Sir, Chief O'Brien
doesn't recommend

577
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:56,740
increasing velocity
through the plasma fields.

578
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,699
Objection noted.

579
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,243
Now get me more<i> speed.</i>

580
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:01,120
Engine room, bridge.
More speed.

581
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,708
Sir, picking up
a distress signal.

582
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,961
It's the Starship<i> Malinche.</i>

583
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:12,548
They've been ambushed
by the Maquis.

584
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:15,801
It's dead in space.

585
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:37,239
How can we help you, Captain?

586
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:40,451
Our warp core matrix
compositor is fused.

587
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:43,036
Our navigational systems
are disabled.

588
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:45,456
If you could spare
some micro-power relays,

589
00:27:45,456 --> 00:27:46,999
we should have
the engines

590
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,917
back on line
in a day or two.

591
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:52,296
Engine room, beam a damage
control team to the<i> Malinche.</i>

592
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:55,549
Tell them to take along
a dozen micro-power relays.

593
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:57,217
Engine room...

594
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,719
We got a distress signal
from a Cardassian freighter.

595
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,347
They'd just been attacked
by the Maquis.

596
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:03,932
Suffered some casualties.

597
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,018
Our sensors confirmed
what we were being told,

598
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:07,603
but when we lowered the shields

599
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:09,355
to transport some
of the wounded...

600
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:12,024
The sensor readings
had been faked.

601
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:13,775
There were no Cardassians
on that freighter.

602
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:16,778
The Maquis had rigged it
with a focused particle beam

603
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,364
that punched
through our gyro shielding,

604
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:19,865
and we lost helm control.

605
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:21,699
And by the time we got
back on our feet again,

606
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:23,785
three Maquis raiders
came out of the plasma field.

607
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:28,165
Well...

608
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:32,294
it seems I couldn't get the job
done either, Captain.

609
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:34,213
It's not over.

610
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:36,882
I figured you'd
be going after him.

611
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:40,093
We have something
that might be useful to you.

612
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:44,306
We intercepted a coded message
from one of Eddington's raiders.

613
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:46,016
Maybe you
can decode it.

614
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:47,518
Our, uh, computers
are still down.

615
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:48,644
I appreciate it.

616
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:52,022
Do me a favor?
Of course.

617
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:55,651
Save me a seat
at his court-martial.

618
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:58,820
Count on it.

619
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,989
Good hunting, Captain.

620
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,416
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

621
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:13,252
<i>With the</i> Defiant's<i> computers</i>

622
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:16,004

627
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:29,476
Sir, incoming transmission.
It's Odo.

628
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:32,354
Captain.

629
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:35,566
Odo, we need
some good news around here.

630
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:37,443
Tell me that you have some.

631
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:38,985
Possibly.

632
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:40,987
I've analyzed
the Maquis message.

633
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,781
And?

634
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,576
It appears to be a simple
Breen nursery rhyme.

635
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:47,578
A heterophonic,
five-line verse.

636
00:29:47,578 --> 00:29:49,538
Quite a catchy one, too.

637
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:52,374
(<i> music playing</i> )

638
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:55,168
What does it mean?
Well, metrical analysis

639
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:58,505
shows an alternating tetrameter
and pentameter structure,

640
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:01,425
but the computer could find no
meaningful pattern in the words.

641
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:03,260
They appear to be
just what they are--

642
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:07,264
nonsensical phrases strung
together because they rhyme--

643
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:10,142
at least to the Breen.
And the music?

644
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,519
It's written
on a Lyxian scale.

645
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,480
I ran it through
the computer, too.

646
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,606
No meaningful pattern.

647
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:17,566
So we're nowhere.

648
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,401
Now, I wouldn't say that.

649
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:21,987
You see, I remembered something
that Eddington once said to me.

650
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:25,949
"The best place to hide
something is in plain sight."

651
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:30,078
And since this is
a<i> Breen</i> nursery rhyme...

652
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:33,540
So you think that Eddington
is using the music as a signal

653
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,542
for a rendezvous
in the Breen system?

654
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,503
Or a Breen settlement

655
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:40,756
like the one on Portas V,
which isn't far from the DMZ.

656
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:44,009
The biogenic components of the
weapons Eddington's been using

657
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:46,178
are very bulky
and very unstable.

658
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,763
They need to be kept

659
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:50,390
in a large, sophisticated
cold-storage unit.

660
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:53,893
And if anyone knows how to keep
things cold, it's the Breen.

661
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:56,647
Thank you, Odo.

662
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:57,856
Captain.

663
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:05,698
Mr. Worf,
do we have a series

664
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:08,408
of sensor relays near Portas V?

665
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:09,576
Yes, sir.

666
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,537
Two class-5 intelligence drones.

667
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:13,622
Pull their sensor logs.

668
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:16,875
I want to see who's been
visiting the Breen system.

669
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:20,462
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

670
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:22,548
<i>Odo's hunch</i>
<i>has proven accurate.</i>

671
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:25,091
<i>Our intelligence drones</i>
<i>detected a Maquis freighter</i>

672
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:27,344
<i>entering Portas V</i>
<i>three hours ago.</i>

673
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:29,095
<i>The freighter was last seen</i>

674
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:31,682
<i>headed into the Dorvan sector</i>
<i>of the DMZ.</i>

675
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:34,685
Considering the freighter's
range, velocity and heading,

676
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:38,021
Eddington's next target is one
of four Cardassian colonies.

677
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,356
But...

678
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:42,484
these targets
are unlikely.

679
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,986
Their defense systems
were recently upgraded

680
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,405
by the Cardassians.

681
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:47,823
Hmm.

682
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:50,033
Eddington isn't looking
for a fight.

683
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:53,286
That leaves only Quatal
and Panora.

684
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:55,121
WORF:
Quatal has
a lucrative

685
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:57,499
mining operation, and
their weapon systems

686
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:59,125
are in the process
of being upgraded,

687
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,712
<i>but</i> they're not
fully operational.

688
00:32:01,712 --> 00:32:03,589
A tempting target.

689
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:05,090
Not as tempting as Panora.

690
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,592
The Maquis attacked
them two months ago.

691
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:08,385
And most of their
defense systems

692
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:10,554
were severely damaged.
They're almost helpless.

693
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:13,306
And there are constant
ion storms in that system--

694
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,683
good places to hide

695
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:16,560
if you want to mount
a surprise attack.

696
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,270
A tactic Eddington knows well.

697
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:21,314
Panora<i> is</i> a more logical
target than Quatal.

698
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,400
Then Eddington will attack
Quatal.

699
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,943
WORF:
Sir?

700
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,570
He likes being unpredictable.

701
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:33,368
Approaching Quatal Prime.

702
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,495
Slow to impulse power.
Full scan.

703
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,664

704
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:40,041
Initiate lateral scanners.

705
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,752
We're too late, Captain.

706
00:32:41,752 --> 00:32:44,504
Eddington's detonated
his weapon.

707
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:45,964
The nerve agent
is already spreading

708
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,007
through the planet's atmosphere.

709
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:50,886
Which means the
Cardassians don't have
much time to get away.

710
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:53,221
Eddington's always
one step ahead of us.

711
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,848
Maybe not this time.

712
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:56,725
I'm reading residual
neutrino levels.

713
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:58,852
Looks like one,
maybe two Maquis raiders

714
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:00,353
behind the fourth moon.

715
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:01,480
They're on the run.

716
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,731
Go after them.
Full impulse.

717
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:04,483
Engine room, bridge.
Full impulse.

718
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,568
On screen.
Shields up.
Charge phaser banks.

719
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:08,111
CREWPERSON:
Aye, sir.

720
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,572
SISKO:
How long to intercept?
15 seconds.

721
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:12,115
Prepare to
lock targets.

722
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,826
WORF:
Targeting sequence on...

723
00:33:13,826 --> 00:33:15,201
SISKO:
Hard to port.

724
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,162
Stick with this one, old man.

725
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:18,455
They've locked phasers on us.

726
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:20,540
Power to forward shields.

727
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,584
Forward shields, on line.

728
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:24,503
DAX:
Restabilize port and...
Lock target.

729
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:26,672
Targeting scanners...
synchronized.

730
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:27,798
Fire!

731
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:31,426
SISKO:
Helm, bring us about.

732
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,928
One more to go.

733
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:40,352
Sir, this one's making
another run for the planet.

734
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,938
I don't get it-- they've
already poisoned the atmosphere.

735
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:44,314
More speed.

736
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:46,483
Engine room, bridge.
More speed.

737
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:49,068
They've locked phasers
on one of the transport ships

738
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,654
evacuating the Cardassians.

739
00:33:57,995 --> 00:33:59,705
They've disabled the transport.

740
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:01,540
It's losing power.

741
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,791
It's going down.

742
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,125
Can we beam
the crew off?

743
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,335
We're out
of transporter range.

744
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:06,920
Incoming transmission.

745
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,551
Well, Javert...

746
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:15,345
let's see how deep your
obsession with me is.

747
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:18,223
You've got me.
I can't outrun
or outfight

748
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,058
the<i> Defiant,</i> but...

749
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:23,353
if you come after me,
you'll have to pay a price--

750
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:26,940
you'll have to let
all those helpless Cardassians

751
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,275
spiral down to their deaths.

752
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,152
The choice is yours.

753
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,281
How long
do they have?
Two minutes to impact.

754
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,909
EDDINGTON:
Not much time.

755
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:39,494
Probably take you
at least a minute

756
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,120
to get back to the planet.

757
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,915
They're just Cardassians.

758
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,210
Helm, bring us about.

759
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,837
Prepare to engage tractor beam.

760
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:50,338
WORF:
Initializing tractor beam.

761
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,631
Aligning induction field.

762
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,383
CREWPERSON:
Alignment complete.

763
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:29,127
We've towed
the transport ship

764
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,546
out of the planet's
gravitational pull.

765
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,882
Once our repair team
is back on board,

766
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:35,717
release the tractor beam.

767
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:38,095
The Cardassians can
limp their way home

768
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:39,512
in a day or two.

769
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,601
<i>Les Misérables?</i>

770
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:46,019
You know it?

771
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:48,521
I can't stand Victor Hugo.

772
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:52,109
I tried reading
<i>The Hunchback of Notre Dame,</i>

773
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:54,736
but I couldn't
get through it.

774
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:57,114
It was<i> so</i> melodramatic,

775
00:35:57,114 --> 00:36:00,659
and his heroines are
so two-dimensional.

776
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:04,537
Eddington compares me
to one of the characters--

777
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,372
Inspector Javert--

778
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:10,418
a policeman who
relentlessly pursues

779
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,921
a man named Valjean.

780
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:15,381
Guilty of
a trivial offense.

781
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:17,550
And in the end,

782
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:21,387
Javert's own inflexibility
destroys him.

783
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:22,848
He commits suicide.

784
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:26,643
You can't believe
that description fits you.

785
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:31,106
Eddington is just trying
to... get under your skin.

786
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:33,483
He did that eight months ago.

787
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:38,446
What strikes me about this book

788
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:41,616
is that Eddington said that
it's one of his favorites.

789
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,119
There's no accounting for taste.

790
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:46,913
Oh, let's think about it.

791
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:50,709
A Starfleet security officer
is fascinated

792
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:54,629
by a 19th-century
French melodrama, and now,

793
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,006
he's a leader
of the Maquis--

794
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:57,716
a resistance group

795
00:36:57,716 --> 00:37:01,302
fighting the noble battle
against the "evil" Cardassians.

796
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:04,305
It sounds like he's
living out his own fantasy.

797
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:05,390
Mm-hmm.

798
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,142
Exactly.

799
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,062
And you know what?

800
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:14,066
<i>Les Misérables</i> isn't
about the policeman.

801
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:19,029
It's about Valjean--
the victim

802
00:37:19,029 --> 00:37:21,198
of a monstrous
injustice,

803
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:24,117
who spends his entire
life helping people.

804
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:28,454
Making noble sacrifices
for others.

805
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:34,293
That's how Eddington
sees himself.

806
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:36,337
<i>He's</i> Valjean.

807
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,631
He's Robin Hood.

808
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:42,301
He's a romantic,
dashing figure,

809
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:46,223
fighting the good fight
against insurmountable odds.

810
00:37:46,223 --> 00:37:49,267
The secret life
of Michael Eddington.

811
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,145
How does it help us?

812
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:56,315
Well, Eddington is the hero
of his own story.

813
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,818
That makes me the villain.

814
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,613
And what is it
that every hero wants to do?

815
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,823
Kill the bad guy.

816
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,491
Ah, that's
part of it.

817
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:08,120
Heroes only kill
when they have to.

818
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,622
Eddington could have killed me
back at the refugee camp,

819
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:13,125
or when he disabled
the<i> Defiant,</i>

820
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:17,963
but in the best melodramas,
the villain creates a situation

821
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:21,174
where the hero is forced
to sacrifice himself

822
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:25,220
for the people, for the cause--
one final, grand gesture.

823
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,930
What are you getting at,
Benjamin?

824
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:31,350
I think it's time
for me to become the villain.

825
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:35,647
Commander.

826
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:38,150
Prepare two
quantum torpedoes.

827
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:40,235
Have Engineering
attach a cargo pod

828
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:42,695
with 200 kilograms
of trilithium

829
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,072
to each torpedo.

830
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:45,698
Yes, sir, but...

831
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:46,783
But what?

832
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:48,326
The extra mass
of a cargo pod

833
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,787
will make the torpedo
less effective.

834
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:54,040
Maquis raiders are small
and maneuverable.

835
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,709
I'm not planning to fire
at any ships, Mr. Worf.

836
00:38:56,709 --> 00:39:00,255
Major, what's the nearest
Maquis colony?

837
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:04,134
Solosos III.
Less than an hour away.

838
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:06,552
Helm, set a course
for Solosos III.

839
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:08,221
Major, I want
you to send

840
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:11,057
the following message on
all Maquis frequencies.

841
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:14,352
"To all the members
of the Maquis resistance.

842
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:17,772
"This is Captain Sisko
of the USS<i> Defiant.</i>

843
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:21,276
"In response to the Maquis' use
of biogenic weapons

844
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:22,861
"in their
recent attacks,

00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,446

"to all human life

852
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:43,381
I suggest evacuation plans
begin immediately."

853
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:54,184
What are you
waiting for, people?

854
00:39:54,184 --> 00:39:56,228
Carry out your orders.

855
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:13,995
Set torpedo targets
to 50 kilometers

856
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:15,997
above ground level.
CREWPERSON:
Aye, sir.

857
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:19,376
Lock.
Ready, Captain.
Time?

858
00:40:19,376 --> 00:40:21,961
One minute left.
And still no transport
ship activity

859
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:24,172
or any other sign
they're beginning to evacuate.

860
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:25,506
Commander Worf,

861
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,884
prepare to fire torpedoes
on my mark.

862
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:30,303
Detach safeties
on torpedoes one and two.

863
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:33,056
Incoming transmission.
It's Eddington.

864
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:38,853
What are you really
up to, Javert?

865
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,521
Do you expect me
to believe

866
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:43,233
that a decorated
Starfleet officer--

867
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:44,525
the pride of the service--

868
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,194
is going to poison
an entire planet?

869
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:48,780
That's exactly
what I'm going to do.

870
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,283
You're bluffing.

871
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:53,451
Am I?

872
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,704
Commander, launch torpedoes.

873
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:06,464
Commander, I said
launch torpedoes.

874
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,549
Aye, sir.

875
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:22,063
KIRA:
The trilithium resin

876
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:24,065
is dissipating
throughout the biosphere.

877
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:26,109
The Maquis are scrambling
their transport ships.

878
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:27,360
They're starting
to evacuate.

879
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,486
Do you realize what you've done?

880
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,405
SISKO:
I've only just begun.

881
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:34,826
I'm going to eliminate
every Maquis colony in the DMZ.

882
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:37,203
You're talking about turning
hundreds of thousands of people

883
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,456
into homeless refugees.
That's right.

884
00:41:39,456 --> 00:41:42,541
When you attacked the<i> Malinche,</i>
you proved one thing--

885
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:45,420
that the Maquis have become
an intolerable threat

886
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,255
to the security
of the Federation,

887
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:49,466
and I am going
to eliminate that threat.

888
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:51,426
But think about those people
you saw in the caves,

889
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:54,095
huddled and starving.
They didn't attack the<i> Malinche.</i>

890
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,763
You should have thought
about that

891
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:58,557
before you attacked
a Federation starship.

892
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:01,478
Helm, lay in a course
for Tracken II, warp six.

893
00:42:01,478 --> 00:42:03,729
Commander, prepare
two more torpedoes.

894
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:06,149
Engine room, bridge.
Set course 050 mark 179.

895
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:09,486
Unlock safeties on
torpedoes three and four.

896
00:42:09,486 --> 00:42:11,904
Can't you see
what's happening to you?

897
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:14,615
You're going against everything
you claim to believe in.

898
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,117
And for what?

899
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:18,203
To satisfy a personal vendetta?

900
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:19,537
You betrayed your uniform!

901
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:22,165
And you're betraying yours,
right now.

902
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:25,335
The sad part is,
you don't even realize it.

903
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:29,339
I feel sorry for you, Captain.

904
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:32,967
This obsession with me--
look what it's cost you.

905
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,886
Major!
Shut that thing off.

906
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:38,181
Commander Worf, prepare to
launch torpedoes.
Wait!

907
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:45,021
If...

908
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:47,648
you call off your attack,

909
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:50,860
I'll turn over
all our biogenic weapons.

910
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,320
Not enough.

911
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:55,323
(<i> sighs</i> )

912
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:01,538
All right, Javert.

913
00:43:01,538 --> 00:43:04,665
I'll give you what you want.

914
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08,794
Me.

915
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:24,685
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

916
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:28,064
<i>Resettlement efforts</i>
<i>in the DMZ are underway.</i>

917
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:29,815
<i>The Cardassian</i>
<i>and Maquis colonists</i>

918
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:31,484
<i>who were forced</i>
<i>to abandon their homes</i>

919
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:33,361
<i>will make new lives</i>
<i>for themselves</i>

920
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:35,530
<i>on the planets</i>
<i>their counterparts evacuated.</i>

921
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:38,032
<i>The balance in the region</i>
<i>will be restored,</i>

922
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:40,952
<i>though the situation</i>
<i>remains far from stable.</i>

923
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:43,162
Captain. Commander.

924
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:44,205
Welcome home.

925
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:45,664
It's good to be back.

926
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:48,501
I gather your trip
was productive.

927
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:58,803
Constable.

928
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:00,930
ODO:
This way.

929
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:09,314
Benjamin, I'm curious.

930
00:44:09,314 --> 00:44:12,691
Your plan to poison
the Maquis planets--

931
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:15,403
you didn't clear it
with Starfleet first, did you?

932
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,738
I knew I'd forgotten
to do something.

933
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,740
Ah. Big gamble.

934
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,660
That's what it takes
to be a good villain.

935
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:26,456
You know, sometimes I like it
when the bad guy wins.
