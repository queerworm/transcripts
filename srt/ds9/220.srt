1
00:00:44,155 --> 00:00:47,185
The Cardassian Freighter <i>Bok'Nor</i>
is requesting permission

2
00:00:47,229 --> 00:00:49,632
to depart Upper Pylon 1
in three minutes.

3
00:00:49,668 --> 00:00:51,798
We have an incoming
Bolian vessel

4
00:00:51,839 --> 00:00:53,832
at coordinates 101 mark 38.

5
00:00:53,877 --> 00:00:55,278
Give the <i>Bok'Nor</i>
a clear trajectory

6
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:56,439
out of the traffic pattern.

7
00:00:56,483 --> 00:00:58,282
Acknowledged.

8
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,290
Feel like getting together
for dinner tonight?

9
00:01:00,357 --> 00:01:03,090
Can't. I'm having dinner
with Captain Boday.

10
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:04,190
The Gallamite?

11
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:06,032
You're going
out on a date with him?

12
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,371
Is something wrong with that?

13
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:11,006
No... not at all.

14
00:01:11,047 --> 00:01:12,812
He happens to be brilliant.

15
00:01:12,851 --> 00:01:15,186
His brain is twice the size
of yours and mine.

16
00:01:15,223 --> 00:01:17,193
I know, I've seen it.

17
00:01:17,228 --> 00:01:20,724
It's not his fault Gallamites
have transparent skulls.

18
00:01:20,769 --> 00:01:22,204
No, it's not.

19
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:27,273
It's... not exactly the view
I want to have with dinner.

20
00:01:27,384 --> 00:01:30,015
You know, Kira,
sometimes I think you place

21
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:32,152
too much emphasis
on how men look.

22
00:01:32,195 --> 00:01:33,687
What's that supposed to mean?

23
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,529
Nothing.

24
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:37,767
Look, when I kiss a man
good night

25
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:40,277
I like to know
where I'm kissing him.

26
00:01:40,312 --> 00:01:43,752
I guess seven lifetimes gives me
a somewhat broader perspective.

27
00:01:43,786 --> 00:01:45,653
Well, since I just have
one lifetime

28
00:01:45,691 --> 00:01:47,627
I have to be
a little more particular

29
00:01:47,661 --> 00:01:48,994
about whom I go out with.

30
00:01:49,031 --> 00:01:51,332
I never said
I wasn't particular.

31
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:53,670
I'm not the one
who dates Ferengis.

32
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:55,439
And what's that
supposed to mean?

33
00:01:55,478 --> 00:01:56,845
Nothing.

34
00:02:00,322 --> 00:02:03,261
Releasing docking clamps
at Upper Pylon 1.

35
00:02:04,465 --> 00:02:06,298
That's funny.

36
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:08,704
I'm picking up elevated...

37
00:02:08,741 --> 00:02:11,110
DS9 to <i>Bok'Nor.</i>
Shut down your engines.

38
00:02:11,146 --> 00:02:13,116
Repeat.
Shut down your engines!

39
00:02:17,861 --> 00:02:19,296
Report.

40
00:02:19,331 --> 00:02:21,028
Some kind of impulse overload.
Checking.

41
00:02:21,068 --> 00:02:22,628
Ops to all
engineering personnel.

42
00:02:22,672 --> 00:02:23,936
Report to rescue stations.

43
00:02:23,975 --> 00:02:26,310
We have an S.I.D. In progress.

44
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,579
There's nothing left of it.

45
00:02:28,618 --> 00:02:31,146
There's no one left to rescue.

46
00:04:38,105 --> 00:04:41,272
Kelindide, rodinium...

47
00:04:41,312 --> 00:04:42,371
nothing unusual there.

48
00:04:42,414 --> 00:04:45,546
All materials commonly used
in Cardassian ship construction.

49
00:04:45,588 --> 00:04:48,185
Maybe it was a malfunction
in the impulse generator.

50
00:04:48,227 --> 00:04:50,460
I'd like to be able
to tell you that, Major

51
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:51,968
but it's too soon to be sure.

52
00:04:52,002 --> 00:04:53,562
I can't believe the Cardassians

53
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:56,133
have waited this long
for an official explanation.

54
00:04:56,178 --> 00:04:57,271
Anything, Chief?

55
00:04:57,313 --> 00:04:59,374
No sign of an explosive device
yet, sir.

56
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:02,084
I've got every Admiral within
subspace range on my back.

57
00:05:02,124 --> 00:05:05,120
Can I at least tell them
that it looks like an accident?

58
00:05:05,165 --> 00:05:06,964
Well, I wouldn't do that yet.

59
00:05:07,002 --> 00:05:08,266
When?

60
00:05:08,305 --> 00:05:09,330
I'll let you know, sir.

61
00:05:09,374 --> 00:05:11,105
Anything from the Cardassians,
Commander?

62
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,339
Not a word.

63
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,510
All Bajoran outposts
have been put on alert

64
00:05:14,552 --> 00:05:16,146
for retaliatory strikes.

65
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:18,558
The provisional government
has made a statement

66
00:05:18,661 --> 00:05:20,221
disavowing any responsibility.

67
00:05:20,264 --> 00:05:21,995
Maybe it really was an accident.

68
00:05:22,035 --> 00:05:23,561
I mean, it is a possibility.

69
00:05:23,605 --> 00:05:25,040
An accident involving

70
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,569
a Cardassian ship
in Bajoran space?

71
00:05:27,614 --> 00:05:30,450
If I were a Cardassian,
I wouldn't easily accept...

72
00:05:30,487 --> 00:05:31,751
That's odd.

73
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,089
What?

74
00:05:33,126 --> 00:05:35,597
I'm picking up traces
of a mercassium compound.

75
00:05:35,698 --> 00:05:37,327
Mercassium?
There shouldn't have been

76
00:05:37,368 --> 00:05:39,532
any mercassium
on board that ship.

77
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:41,236
Well, there was.

78
00:05:41,277 --> 00:05:42,336
Meaning?

79
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:43,848
I'm not quite sure yet.

80
00:05:43,883 --> 00:05:45,716
Well, is mercassium
some kind of explosive?

81
00:05:45,753 --> 00:05:47,746
No, it's a synthetic composite

82
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:49,922
used in shield generator
construction

83
00:05:49,962 --> 00:05:51,522
by the Federation.

84
00:05:51,566 --> 00:05:53,969
We don't share that technology
with anyone.

85
00:05:54,005 --> 00:05:57,103
Chief, I don't think you're
going to find any evidence

86
00:05:57,145 --> 00:05:58,113
of an explosive device.

87
00:05:58,147 --> 00:05:59,115
Lieutenant, respectfully

88
00:05:59,149 --> 00:06:00,846
these kinds of things
take time, and I...

89
00:06:00,887 --> 00:06:02,322
I don't think
you're going to find

90
00:06:02,356 --> 00:06:04,019
any evidence
of an explosive device

91
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,221
because I'm pretty sure

92
00:06:05,263 --> 00:06:07,496
it was an implosive
protomatter device

93
00:06:07,535 --> 00:06:09,972
designed to match
the impulse signature.

94
00:06:10,006 --> 00:06:11,532
Just before the explosion

95
00:06:11,577 --> 00:06:13,410
I picked up a sudden increase

96
00:06:13,448 --> 00:06:14,747
in their fusion rate.

97
00:06:14,784 --> 00:06:16,914
I've been trying to find
any sign of malfunction

98
00:06:16,956 --> 00:06:18,892
in the <i>Bok'Nor's</i>
engines to explain it

99
00:06:18,926 --> 00:06:20,190
but there just isn't one.

100
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,758
This doesn't look
like an accident.

101
00:06:22,802 --> 00:06:24,465
The fusion shock
had to be caused

102
00:06:24,505 --> 00:06:27,136
by something external
to the impulse drive system.

103
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,911
If a protomatter device
was attached to the cross-feeds

104
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,647
that could have created
the overload

105
00:06:31,755 --> 00:06:33,418
and we'd never see
any sign of it.

106
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:34,928
Can you prove
that's what happened?

107
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,260
Maybe

108
00:06:36,298 --> 00:06:38,131
if we can get
a high resolution spectra

109
00:06:38,168 --> 00:06:39,158
of the impulse debris

110
00:06:39,204 --> 00:06:40,503
but that's going to take...

111
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,009
Time.
Yes, I know.

112
00:06:42,044 --> 00:06:43,273
Get it started.

113
00:06:43,313 --> 00:06:45,249
I'll tell the Admirals.

114
00:06:45,285 --> 00:06:46,549
Sisko out.

115
00:06:48,725 --> 00:06:50,024
Benjamin.

116
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:51,051
Ah.

117
00:06:52,734 --> 00:06:55,103
Cal, thanks for coming
on such short notice.

118
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,441
I wish it didn't take
a disaster like this

119
00:06:57,477 --> 00:06:59,140
to bring us back together again.

120
00:06:59,181 --> 00:07:00,707
Hi, Calvin.

121
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,188
Jadzia Dax.

122
00:07:04,225 --> 00:07:06,218
Dax?!

123
00:07:07,968 --> 00:07:08,993
My goodness!

124
00:07:09,036 --> 00:07:12,476
Well, you look a lot better
than when last I saw you.

125
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,979
Chief of Security Odo.

126
00:07:14,014 --> 00:07:16,110
Commander Calvin Hudson

127
00:07:16,152 --> 00:07:18,521
Starfleet's attaché to
the Federation colonies

128
00:07:18,558 --> 00:07:20,050
in the new
Demilitarized Zone.

129
00:07:20,094 --> 00:07:21,825
You must be concerned about

130
00:07:21,865 --> 00:07:24,701
the colonies' security
at a time like this.

131
00:07:24,804 --> 00:07:26,603
Well, we haven't noticed
any unusual deployment

132
00:07:26,641 --> 00:07:28,133
from the Cardassians
along the border.

133
00:07:28,178 --> 00:07:31,117
Neither have we, and that's
what's got me worried.

134
00:07:31,152 --> 00:07:32,815
Let's go into my office.

135
00:07:32,856 --> 00:07:35,487
Lieutenant, I don't
have time this trip

136
00:07:35,528 --> 00:07:38,865
but you and I have a few stories
to catch up on.

137
00:07:38,902 --> 00:07:42,342
- Next time.
- Next time.

138
00:07:42,376 --> 00:07:46,317
That woman knows more about me
than any woman ever has.

139
00:07:46,352 --> 00:07:48,083
More than my wife, even.

140
00:07:48,122 --> 00:07:49,751
Tell me about it.

141
00:07:49,826 --> 00:07:52,993
Don't you find things
a little uncomfortable?

142
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:56,268
Oh, no, she's a good officer.

143
00:07:56,307 --> 00:07:58,004
Yes, but Curzon was...

144
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:00,071
She's not Curzon.

145
00:08:00,115 --> 00:08:02,416
Now, you two aren't, I mean...

146
00:08:04,091 --> 00:08:06,824
Oh, no.
She may not be Curzon

147
00:08:06,864 --> 00:08:08,493
but she is Dax.

148
00:08:08,534 --> 00:08:13,033
Yes, that would be
extremely... strange.

149
00:08:13,077 --> 00:08:16,539
So, Ben, how is Jake?

150
00:08:16,585 --> 00:08:17,678
As tall as me.

151
00:08:17,721 --> 00:08:18,950
No!

152
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,291
He throws inside to knock
the old man off the plate.

153
00:08:21,329 --> 00:08:22,958
A little chin music, huh?

154
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:25,596
Yeah, he's growing up
too fast.

155
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:28,235
Yeah.

156
00:08:30,282 --> 00:08:32,879
It must have been difficult
for you.

157
00:08:32,921 --> 00:08:36,588
At least I didn't have
a child to raise by myself.

158
00:08:36,629 --> 00:08:41,334
Well, we kind of helped
each other through it.

159
00:08:43,177 --> 00:08:44,976
I heard about Gretchen.

160
00:08:45,014 --> 00:08:47,645
I wanted to be there for you.

161
00:08:47,686 --> 00:08:51,285
There was just
no way to get back.

162
00:08:51,328 --> 00:08:53,629
I know that, Ben.

163
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:54,828
You know, I was hoping

164
00:08:54,869 --> 00:08:56,736
when they sent me
to the colonies

165
00:08:56,773 --> 00:08:59,006
that you and I would
have a little time

166
00:08:59,045 --> 00:09:00,344
for some R&R together.

167
00:09:00,381 --> 00:09:01,782
Who's got R&R time?

168
00:09:01,884 --> 00:09:03,649
I know.

169
00:09:03,689 --> 00:09:06,525
You can't imagine
how my life has changed

170
00:09:06,561 --> 00:09:09,796
since the Federation
abandoned these colonies.

171
00:09:09,835 --> 00:09:10,803
Abandoned them?

172
00:09:10,837 --> 00:09:12,136
Doesn't your presence?

173
00:09:12,174 --> 00:09:14,167
My presence there is a joke.

174
00:09:14,211 --> 00:09:17,378
I am supposed to help
these colonies function

175
00:09:17,418 --> 00:09:19,787
under the terms
of the new treaty.

176
00:09:19,824 --> 00:09:22,557
Now, Ben, what the hell
does that mean?

177
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:24,999
I thought these colonists
wanted to stay.

178
00:09:25,035 --> 00:09:26,595
That they refused to evacuate.

179
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,735
The treaty gave away
their territory

180
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,006
to the Cardassians...

181
00:09:30,046 --> 00:09:33,417
territory that these people
had invested their lives in.

182
00:09:33,453 --> 00:09:35,389
Now, Ben, if you knew them
as I do

183
00:09:35,425 --> 00:09:37,452
you'd know why they can't leave.

184
00:09:37,496 --> 00:09:38,657
It's a bad treaty.

185
00:09:38,699 --> 00:09:40,829
The Federation
gave away too much.

186
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,169
Several Cardassian colonies

187
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:45,373
wanted to stay on the Federation
side of the zone, too.

188
00:09:45,414 --> 00:09:47,885
It seemed like
a reasonable compromise.

189
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:49,650
Oh, yes,
the Cardassians would love

190
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,287
to have their colonies
in our territory

191
00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:54,630
because they know
we'd protect them

192
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:57,731
but they have no intention
of doing the same for ours.

193
00:09:57,773 --> 00:10:00,769
A number of Admirals
at Starfleet Command are worried

194
00:10:00,814 --> 00:10:03,650
the destruction of the <i>Bok'Nor</i>
might jeopardize the treaty.

195
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:04,848
Oh, are they really?

196
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:08,056
As the two ranking officers
along the Cardassian border

197
00:10:08,097 --> 00:10:11,036
we've been asked to assess
the potential risk.

198
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,834
There is no risk, Ben.

199
00:10:12,874 --> 00:10:14,844
None.

200
00:10:14,878 --> 00:10:16,939
I have been dealing
with the Cardassians

201
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,419
most of my professional life,
and believe me

202
00:10:19,454 --> 00:10:22,518
they are very pleased with
what they got from the treaty.

203
00:10:22,561 --> 00:10:25,089
They are not about
to risk losing

204
00:10:25,134 --> 00:10:28,973
all they've gained
by sending forces into the zone.

205
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:31,446
They're much too slick for that.

206
00:10:31,481 --> 00:10:35,286
If I were you, I'd be
very concerned with security

207
00:10:35,322 --> 00:10:37,486
along the Bajoran border.

208
00:10:40,535 --> 00:10:43,997
Are you surprised they haven't
responded at all yet?

209
00:10:44,109 --> 00:10:46,239
Well, Ben, you and I both know

210
00:10:46,281 --> 00:10:49,516
they never let you see
what you expect to see.

211
00:10:49,555 --> 00:10:51,856
They'll respond.

212
00:11:06,358 --> 00:11:09,923
Quarters have been arranged
through discreet channels...

213
00:11:09,966 --> 00:11:11,458
Deck 7, Section 4-G.

214
00:11:11,503 --> 00:11:15,170
I suggest you keep a low profile
until your ship arrives.

215
00:11:39,106 --> 00:11:40,666
Can I get you something?

216
00:11:40,776 --> 00:11:42,507
You are Quark, aren't you?

217
00:11:42,547 --> 00:11:44,483
I assure you,
the warrant is out of date.

218
00:11:44,517 --> 00:11:46,248
I cleared that matter up
months ago.

219
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,156
Warrant?

220
00:11:48,193 --> 00:11:50,687
Oh, uh, when you recognized me,
I assumed...

221
00:11:50,765 --> 00:11:52,564
You are counting your receipts.

222
00:11:52,602 --> 00:11:54,094
It is logical to conclude

223
00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:56,702
you are the proprietor
of the establishment.

224
00:11:56,778 --> 00:11:58,077
You're very observant.

225
00:11:58,114 --> 00:11:59,447
What can I do for you?

226
00:11:59,484 --> 00:12:02,285
I was hoping to discuss
a business proposition.

227
00:12:02,324 --> 00:12:03,657
With me?

228
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:06,857
Uh, perhaps I should explain
about that slip of the tongue.

229
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,893
Your past
is of no consequence to me.

230
00:12:08,938 --> 00:12:10,771
I'm delighted
to hear you say that

231
00:12:10,809 --> 00:12:12,779
because nothing
would please me more

232
00:12:12,813 --> 00:12:15,786
than to make a fresh start
with the Vulcans, Ms., uh?

233
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,850
- Sakonna.
- Sakonna.

234
00:12:18,894 --> 00:12:20,523
Such a handsome name

235
00:12:20,564 --> 00:12:23,127
for such a handsome young woman.

236
00:12:23,169 --> 00:12:25,402
What will you have to drink?

237
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,601
Wait a minute.

238
00:12:26,644 --> 00:12:28,546
I have just the thing.

239
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,314
Vulcan port.

240
00:12:32,957 --> 00:12:34,517
Three centuries old.

241
00:12:34,561 --> 00:12:38,023
Very rare, very expensive.

242
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:39,196
Shall I pour you a glass?

243
00:12:39,238 --> 00:12:40,206
No.

244
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,971
Not even a taste?
It's exquisite.

245
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:42,978
I'm not thirsty

246
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,744
thus, I see no reason
to have a drink.

247
00:12:44,784 --> 00:12:48,451
Well, it'll be right here
should you develop a thirst.

248
00:12:48,491 --> 00:12:51,658
Now, uh, you mentioned
a business proposition.

249
00:12:51,699 --> 00:12:52,963
It is a private matter.

250
00:12:53,001 --> 00:12:54,971
I would rather not
discuss it here.

251
00:12:55,006 --> 00:12:56,873
Then we can discuss
it over dinner.

252
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,108
That is, we can plan
the business meeting

253
00:12:59,148 --> 00:13:01,984
to coincide with when you think
you might get hungry.

254
00:13:02,021 --> 00:13:03,388
That would be acceptable.

255
00:13:03,424 --> 00:13:04,723
That would be wonderful.

256
00:13:04,761 --> 00:13:06,594
How does 8:00
sound to your tummy?

257
00:13:06,632 --> 00:13:08,762
I will return then.

258
00:13:13,046 --> 00:13:15,176
And, by the way

259
00:13:15,217 --> 00:13:20,856
I'd love to melt
that cold Vulcan heart of yours.

260
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:25,832
Bleech.

261
00:13:29,615 --> 00:13:30,879
Oh!

262
00:13:30,918 --> 00:13:33,719
Oh, here, allow me.

263
00:13:33,757 --> 00:13:35,784
Thank you.

264
00:13:35,896 --> 00:13:39,199
Ah! Oh...

265
00:13:48,356 --> 00:13:50,258
Jake-o?

266
00:13:50,294 --> 00:13:52,959
Your son is not here,
Commander.

267
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,263
Dukat.

268
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,501
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.

269
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:57,840
Where is he?

270
00:13:57,944 --> 00:13:59,277
Who? Your son?

271
00:13:59,314 --> 00:14:01,113
How would I know?

272
00:14:01,151 --> 00:14:02,244
I just...

273
00:14:02,287 --> 00:14:05,088
Commander, you don't?

274
00:14:08,099 --> 00:14:12,804
Do you think I would ever
do anything to harm your son?

275
00:14:12,843 --> 00:14:14,813
I think
you're capable of anything.

276
00:14:14,848 --> 00:14:16,681
You wound me, sir.

277
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:19,190
I'm here as your friend.

278
00:14:19,224 --> 00:14:20,488
Sisko to Kira.

279
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:23,830
Please do not do anything
hastily, Commander.

280
00:14:23,867 --> 00:14:25,359
We must talk in private.

281
00:14:25,404 --> 00:14:26,703
Yes, Commander?

282
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,768
Major, I want you to find Jake.

283
00:14:28,812 --> 00:14:30,007
Is he missing?

284
00:14:30,048 --> 00:14:31,016
I don't know.

285
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,679
Find out where he is
and let me know.

286
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,710
Understood.

287
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:36,958
How the hell
did you get in here?

288
00:14:36,996 --> 00:14:38,863
I was an unregistered passenger

289
00:14:38,934 --> 00:14:41,873
on a Kotakian ship
that docked here this morning.

290
00:14:41,941 --> 00:14:44,071
I slipped in
through the cargo bay.

291
00:14:44,112 --> 00:14:49,055
Hmm. And made your way here
without anyone seeing you.

292
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,459
I was the Commander
of this station

293
00:14:51,495 --> 00:14:53,294
for almost ten years.

294
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:56,329
When one knows
the various corridors

295
00:14:56,372 --> 00:14:59,003
and passageways as well as I...

296
00:14:59,045 --> 00:15:00,844
Oh, by the way, I love

297
00:15:00,883 --> 00:15:03,856
what you've done
with these quarters.

298
00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:04,948
Kira to Sisko.

299
00:15:04,992 --> 00:15:06,085
Jake's fine, Commander.

300
00:15:06,127 --> 00:15:08,325
He's with Nog,
watching the women

301
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,701
coming off the Bajoran transport
at Docking Bay 1.

302
00:15:10,738 --> 00:15:12,868
Shall I have him
brought to your quarters?

303
00:15:12,909 --> 00:15:14,310
No, that's all right.

304
00:15:14,345 --> 00:15:15,609
Thank you, Major.

305
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,812
Sisko out.

306
00:15:17,853 --> 00:15:19,846
There. You see?

307
00:15:19,891 --> 00:15:22,624
Safe and sound.

308
00:15:23,866 --> 00:15:26,269
What are you doing here?

309
00:15:29,947 --> 00:15:32,510
You have a problem.

310
00:15:32,552 --> 00:15:33,611
Do I?

311
00:15:33,654 --> 00:15:34,883
The <i>Bok'Nor?</i>

312
00:15:34,924 --> 00:15:37,361
Is this the Cardassian
Central Command's way

313
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:39,423
of responding to my communiqués?

314
00:15:39,467 --> 00:15:41,460
On the contrary.

315
00:15:41,504 --> 00:15:43,634
Central Command
has no idea I'm here.

316
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:45,543
It's true.

317
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,072
I'm here unofficially

318
00:15:47,117 --> 00:15:50,488
to help you find out
the truth about the <i>Bok'Nor.</i>

319
00:15:50,524 --> 00:15:52,118
Why would you want to help me?

320
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:54,655
Because I already know
the truth.

321
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,964
Do you know who's responsible?

322
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,197
- I do.
- Who?

323
00:15:57,239 --> 00:15:58,538
You are.

324
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,619
Well, not you personally,
Commander.

325
00:16:03,653 --> 00:16:06,454
I know you to be
an honorable man.

326
00:16:06,493 --> 00:16:09,021
You're not one to sneak around

327
00:16:09,065 --> 00:16:12,938
attaching implosion devices
to impulse engines.

328
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:14,908
But believe it or not

329
00:16:14,945 --> 00:16:19,046
there are those of your brethren
who are willing

330
00:16:19,087 --> 00:16:20,886
to do such things.

331
00:16:23,597 --> 00:16:26,433
Morally superior human beings

332
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:29,932
and other members
of the Federation.

333
00:16:29,978 --> 00:16:33,919
I'm supposed
to take your word for that?

334
00:16:33,953 --> 00:16:35,354
Of course not.

335
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,520
It's my job to convince you

336
00:16:37,562 --> 00:16:40,295
so you can clean up
your own house

337
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:43,398
instead of forcing us
to do it for you

338
00:16:43,441 --> 00:16:47,176
which would certainly
endanger the new treaty.

339
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:49,881
We'll need
one of your runabouts.

340
00:16:49,921 --> 00:16:51,720
Where are we going?

341
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,422
The Volon colonies.

342
00:16:53,463 --> 00:16:55,456
The Demilitarized Zone?

343
00:16:55,501 --> 00:17:00,911
Hmm. Not so demilitarized,
I'm afraid.

344
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:09,396
I can't help but notice

345
00:17:09,431 --> 00:17:11,766
that my controls
are not illuminated.

346
00:17:11,803 --> 00:17:13,830
Isn't it customary
for both seats

347
00:17:13,874 --> 00:17:16,710
to be turned on, so that
I may pilot the craft

348
00:17:16,748 --> 00:17:18,547
in the event of an emergency?

349
00:17:18,585 --> 00:17:21,854
If there's an emergency,
I guess you're out of luck.

350
00:17:21,892 --> 00:17:24,125
Commander, I'm not
going to sit here

351
00:17:24,163 --> 00:17:26,634
and steal
your little technical secrets

352
00:17:26,669 --> 00:17:28,138
I promise you.

353
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,732
I appreciate your assurances

354
00:17:29,776 --> 00:17:33,238
but Cardassians are famous
for their photographic memories.

355
00:17:33,283 --> 00:17:35,048
Oh, so you turn off my controls

356
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:36,681
so I don't have enough light

357
00:17:36,725 --> 00:17:38,695
to take my photograph,
is that it?

358
00:17:38,729 --> 00:17:40,996
I've heard they put
Cardassian children

359
00:17:41,034 --> 00:17:42,936
in intense
mind training programs

360
00:17:42,972 --> 00:17:44,566
when they're four years old.

361
00:17:44,609 --> 00:17:45,668
Is that true?

362
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:48,080
The Cardassian
educational system

363
00:17:48,183 --> 00:17:50,244
is unparalleled
in the quadrant.

364
00:17:50,288 --> 00:17:53,591
If you don't mind taking
the joy out of growing up.

365
00:17:53,629 --> 00:17:55,326
Education is power.

366
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:57,735
Joy is vulnerability.

367
00:17:57,771 --> 00:17:58,898
What?

368
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,639
Your reaction
surprises me, Commander.

369
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,912
I thought you
would understand.

370
00:18:03,951 --> 00:18:05,853
Of all the humans I've met

371
00:18:05,889 --> 00:18:08,292
you strike me
as the most joyless

372
00:18:08,327 --> 00:18:10,058
and the least vulnerable.

373
00:18:10,165 --> 00:18:11,828
I am when I'm with you.

374
00:18:14,173 --> 00:18:15,608
Well said.

375
00:18:15,643 --> 00:18:17,579
But, in truth,
I'm looking forward

376
00:18:17,615 --> 00:18:20,280
to getting to know you
better on this journey.

377
00:18:20,321 --> 00:18:22,622
I think we know each other
well enough.

378
00:18:22,659 --> 00:18:26,215
Is that a ramscoop control

379
00:18:26,348 --> 00:18:28,011
or a deflector grid panel?

380
00:18:29,856 --> 00:18:31,655
Just curious.

381
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,526
It really doesn't matter.

382
00:18:33,564 --> 00:18:37,528
Cardassian pursuit vessels
are years ahead of this design.

383
00:18:38,676 --> 00:18:39,803
What is it?

384
00:18:39,844 --> 00:18:41,974
Long-range sensors
are picking up

385
00:18:42,016 --> 00:18:43,280
a distress signal.

386
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:44,446
From who?

387
00:18:44,488 --> 00:18:47,791
A Federation merchant vessel
under attack

388
00:18:47,829 --> 00:18:48,797
by Cardassians.

389
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:54,771
I'm reading
two Cardassian attack vessels

390
00:18:54,811 --> 00:18:57,214
just inside
the Demilitarized Zone.

391
00:18:57,249 --> 00:18:58,582
That's not possible.

392
00:18:58,619 --> 00:19:01,922
I promise you, Commander,
we would not violate the treaty.

393
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,761
The merchant vessel's
com links are down.

394
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,200
I can't raise them.

395
00:19:06,236 --> 00:19:10,041
Computer, fix source coordinates
of the distress signal

396
00:19:10,077 --> 00:19:12,605
and lay in a new course...
warp 3.

397
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,176
I hope you don't mind.

398
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,347
Not at all.

399
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:18,761
I'm as curious about this
as you are.

400
00:19:22,806 --> 00:19:24,867
What type of Cardassian
ships are they?

401
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,504
Patrol cruisers?

402
00:19:26,547 --> 00:19:27,515
No, much smaller.

403
00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:28,608
They look like shuttlecraft.

404
00:19:28,652 --> 00:19:29,677
Cardassian shuttles

405
00:19:29,721 --> 00:19:31,315
attacking a Federation
merchant ship?

406
00:19:31,358 --> 00:19:34,889
They seem to be armed
with Galor-class phaser banks.

407
00:19:34,932 --> 00:19:36,196
They must be from

408
00:19:36,235 --> 00:19:39,002
Cardassian colonies
in the Demilitarized Zone.

409
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,305
Hail them.

410
00:19:40,344 --> 00:19:43,283
- No response.
- Open a channel.

411
00:19:43,317 --> 00:19:45,150
Go ahead.

412
00:19:45,189 --> 00:19:48,720
To the pilots of the Cardassian
attack vessels.

413
00:19:48,763 --> 00:19:52,568
This is Gul Dukat,
Commander of the Second Order.

414
00:19:52,604 --> 00:19:53,799
Please respond.

415
00:19:57,448 --> 00:20:02,517
This is Gul Dukat, security
identification: A-D-L 4-Zero.

416
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:07,332
I order you to immediately
disengage your attack.

417
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:11,978
We're still two minutes away.

418
00:20:12,014 --> 00:20:15,181
The Federation vessel's shields
are down to 40 percent.

419
00:20:15,221 --> 00:20:17,157
Hail those
Cardassians again.

420
00:20:17,192 --> 00:20:20,427
I don't know who you are
or where you come from

421
00:20:20,466 --> 00:20:23,165
but you're going to pay
for this, I promise you.

422
00:20:23,205 --> 00:20:26,178
Answer me immediately,
or I personally will fire

423
00:20:26,212 --> 00:20:28,376
the photons
that will destroy you.

424
00:20:30,988 --> 00:20:32,981
Arm the photons.

425
00:20:34,362 --> 00:20:35,523
The photon launcher is...

426
00:20:35,566 --> 00:20:36,659
I know.

427
00:20:36,701 --> 00:20:39,674
I knew all about these controls
before I ever came on board.

428
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,541
Tell me when we're
in torpedo range.

429
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:42,878
Stand by.

430
00:20:42,915 --> 00:20:45,751
I'm picking up another ship
moving toward them.

431
00:20:45,788 --> 00:20:50,059
That's a Federation signature,
I believe, Commander.

432
00:20:50,097 --> 00:20:51,828
It sure isn't from Starfleet.

433
00:20:51,867 --> 00:20:55,068
I've never seen a ship
configuration like that before.

434
00:20:55,175 --> 00:20:57,646
It almost seems
like someone has modified

435
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,081
an old support courier.

436
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,379
Hmm.

437
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,914
Hailing them.

438
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:04,690
No response.

439
00:21:06,467 --> 00:21:08,027
They fired torpedoes.

440
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:11,009
What kind of civilian
vessel that size

441
00:21:11,043 --> 00:21:13,013
would be carrying photon?

442
00:21:13,048 --> 00:21:16,510
Something from one
of your colonies, perhaps?

443
00:21:21,566 --> 00:21:24,197
Now do you begin to see,
Commander

444
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:27,610
that without any help
from either one of us

445
00:21:27,646 --> 00:21:31,883
they've managed to start
their own little war out here?

446
00:21:44,016 --> 00:21:45,383
I hope you're hungry.

447
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:47,788
I've planned
a wonderful meal for us

448
00:21:47,825 --> 00:21:49,351
starting with <i>plomeek</i> soup

449
00:21:49,394 --> 00:21:51,661
which I know is
a traditional Vulcan favorite

450
00:21:51,699 --> 00:21:56,369
followed by jumbo
Romulan mollusks.

451
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:59,143
You can't get those back
on Vulcan anymore, can you?

452
00:21:59,249 --> 00:22:01,516
Do you eat in this grand
a manner every night?

453
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:03,490
Certainly not; this
is a special occasion.

454
00:22:03,525 --> 00:22:04,584
It is?

455
00:22:04,628 --> 00:22:07,031
The commencement
of a new business relationship

456
00:22:07,067 --> 00:22:09,436
is the most special
occasion for any Ferengi.

457
00:22:09,471 --> 00:22:12,876
It's a cause for opening
great bottles of wine

458
00:22:12,913 --> 00:22:17,287
dancing into the wee,
small hours of the morning.

459
00:22:17,322 --> 00:22:19,121
We'll let it breathe
for a few minutes.

460
00:22:19,226 --> 00:22:21,697
Very well;
I will attempt to respect

461
00:22:21,732 --> 00:22:24,329
some of your cultural
idiosyncrasies.

462
00:22:24,371 --> 00:22:28,142
I will drink the wine,
but I won't dance.

463
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:31,583
Maybe you'll change your mind
after you drink the wine.

464
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,146
No, I won't.

465
00:22:33,191 --> 00:22:34,785
Oh, come on.

466
00:22:34,828 --> 00:22:38,997
Somewhere inside that cool,
controlled exterior of yours

467
00:22:39,037 --> 00:22:43,035
there is a wild woman
screaming to get out.

468
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:44,378
Maybe by the end of the night

469
00:22:44,415 --> 00:22:46,112
you'll be dancing
on the table tops.

470
00:22:46,152 --> 00:22:48,521
Maybe not.

471
00:22:48,557 --> 00:22:52,794
Is it appropriate to begin
our business discussion now?

472
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:55,031
Rule of Acquisition
Number 214:

473
00:22:55,072 --> 00:22:56,974
Never begin
a business negotiation

474
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:58,170
on an empty stomach.

475
00:22:58,212 --> 00:22:59,806
Rule of Acquisition?

476
00:22:59,849 --> 00:23:01,341
Yes.

477
00:23:01,386 --> 00:23:03,823
Every Ferengi
business transaction

478
00:23:03,858 --> 00:23:06,888
is governed
by 285 Rules of Acquisition

479
00:23:06,931 --> 00:23:11,373
to ensure a fair and honest deal
for all parties concerned.

480
00:23:11,408 --> 00:23:13,469
Well, most of them, anyway.

481
00:23:13,512 --> 00:23:16,143
Commendable... to create
a code of behavior

482
00:23:16,184 --> 00:23:17,983
for business transactions...

483
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:19,390
Is logical.

484
00:23:19,425 --> 00:23:21,418
And quite reassuring.

485
00:23:21,463 --> 00:23:23,524
Do Vulcans have
anything similar?

486
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:27,200
In structure, it reminds one
of the Vulcan Bill of Rights

487
00:23:27,243 --> 00:23:30,478
which guarantees the fundamental
personal freedoms

488
00:23:30,517 --> 00:23:32,077
of every Vulcan citizen.

489
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,680
Same thing exactly.

490
00:23:33,723 --> 00:23:35,590
May I propose a toast?

491
00:23:35,628 --> 00:23:38,760
Is this another
cultural idiosyncrasy?

492
00:23:38,802 --> 00:23:41,239
Yes. You know, I can't describe

493
00:23:41,307 --> 00:23:44,246
the honor I feel at this moment.

494
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,720
It's rare that a Ferengi
and a Vulcan

495
00:23:47,754 --> 00:23:49,553
can overcome
their inherent differences

496
00:23:49,591 --> 00:23:51,185
to see eye-to-eye
as we are doing.

497
00:23:51,228 --> 00:23:53,631
I've always had
the greatest respect

498
00:23:53,667 --> 00:23:57,438
for Vulcans, even though
the few I've met

499
00:23:57,476 --> 00:24:00,175
haven't exactly felt
the same way about me.

500
00:24:00,215 --> 00:24:02,413
You're a noble people...

501
00:24:02,453 --> 00:24:04,856
and I salute you.

502
00:24:14,479 --> 00:24:18,112
Now then, what kind
of business proposition

503
00:24:18,155 --> 00:24:20,251
do you have in mind?

504
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:22,192
I wish to procure weapons.

505
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:25,260
I beg your pardon?

506
00:24:25,336 --> 00:24:27,272
Guns, phaser banks,
photon torpedoes...

507
00:24:27,308 --> 00:24:29,643
- Shh.
...troop transports

508
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,878
and a number
of cobalt-thorium devices.

509
00:24:31,918 --> 00:24:33,547
My list is quite extensive.

510
00:24:33,588 --> 00:24:35,684
You're a gun runner?

511
00:24:35,726 --> 00:24:37,696
I am prepared
to pay in latinum

512
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:40,794
and I will very likely need
a continuous supply

513
00:24:40,838 --> 00:24:42,569
for the foreseeable future.

514
00:24:45,047 --> 00:24:49,011
You're not like other Vulcans,
are you?

515
00:24:56,606 --> 00:24:59,545
The Federation merchant ship
refused to be boarded!

516
00:24:59,578 --> 00:25:02,015
So your ships
just decided to open fire?

517
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:04,544
It was clear the Federation ship
was carrying weapons

518
00:25:04,589 --> 00:25:06,582
through the Demilitarized Zone.

519
00:25:06,628 --> 00:25:08,895
That ship was carrying
medical supplies to Saltok IV.

520
00:25:08,933 --> 00:25:11,302
Ben, what are you doing here?

521
00:25:11,371 --> 00:25:12,670
I'm not sure yet.

522
00:25:12,707 --> 00:25:15,178
Gul Dukat asked me
to accompany him.

523
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:16,306
Dukat...

524
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:18,443
no one informed us
you were coming.

525
00:25:18,487 --> 00:25:22,086
I decided an impromptu visit
would be preferable

526
00:25:22,128 --> 00:25:26,126
so you wouldn't be bothered
with special preparations.

527
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:27,138
I see.

528
00:25:27,172 --> 00:25:29,142
Commander Sisko, you know

529
00:25:29,177 --> 00:25:32,290
my counterpart
from the colonies, Gul Evek.

530
00:25:32,423 --> 00:25:34,450
I'm glad you're here
to listen to this, Commander.

531
00:25:34,494 --> 00:25:36,931
We monitored the attack
on the way in.

532
00:25:36,999 --> 00:25:39,129
Yes, "monitor"
is the proper word

533
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:42,611
because none of the ships
would respond to our hails.

534
00:25:42,645 --> 00:25:46,085
Even the Cardassian pilots
refused to acknowledge me.

535
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,489
A strange voice
from a Federation runabout.

536
00:25:48,525 --> 00:25:51,589
I gave them
my security identification.

537
00:25:51,632 --> 00:25:53,967
Well, obviously,
they had their hands full.

538
00:25:54,004 --> 00:25:55,701
With an unprovoked attack.

539
00:25:55,741 --> 00:25:57,142
Unprovoked, was it?

540
00:25:57,177 --> 00:25:59,978
Do you deny that
the Federation is engaging

541
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:02,214
in organized
terrorist activities

542
00:26:02,255 --> 00:26:03,815
against the Cardassian people

543
00:26:03,858 --> 00:26:06,329
deliberately undermining
this treaty?

544
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:08,927
The Federation does not conduct
secret wars.

545
00:26:09,004 --> 00:26:10,199
Then perhaps you can explain

546
00:26:10,239 --> 00:26:11,731
where the Federation ship
came from...

547
00:26:11,776 --> 00:26:13,473
the one outfitted
with photon torpedoes.

548
00:26:13,513 --> 00:26:14,914
Explain why your ships
were armed

549
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,715
with Galor-class phaser banks.

550
00:26:16,754 --> 00:26:18,519
They have a right
to defend themselves

551
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:20,391
against organized
terrorist activities.

552
00:26:20,428 --> 00:26:22,057
I haven't heard any proof yet

553
00:26:22,098 --> 00:26:23,965
of organized
terrorist activities.

554
00:26:24,037 --> 00:26:25,438
Because there is none.

555
00:26:25,473 --> 00:26:26,965
On the contrary.

556
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:29,982
We have the confession
of the Federation terrorist

557
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:32,749
responsible for the destruction
of the <i>Bok'Nor</i>

558
00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:34,349
at your station, Commander.

559
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:36,419
Confession?

560
00:26:38,502 --> 00:26:41,873
A 43-year-old male human,
William Patrick Samuels

561
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:44,642
born Bergen, Norway, Earth...

562
00:26:44,681 --> 00:26:46,275
We know who he is.

563
00:26:46,318 --> 00:26:48,755
What have you done with him?

564
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:51,591
Came to the Federation colony
on Volon II 20 years ago.

565
00:26:51,631 --> 00:26:53,932
Married, wife's name Louise,
two female children

566
00:26:53,968 --> 00:26:56,337
aged 14 and 12.

567
00:26:56,374 --> 00:26:57,501
He was quite cooperative

568
00:26:57,544 --> 00:26:59,446
once we apprehended
him on Deep Space 9.

569
00:27:07,933 --> 00:27:09,459
Begin.

570
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:11,599
My name is William Samuels.

571
00:27:11,641 --> 00:27:16,208
I am being held for crimes
against the Cardassian people.

572
00:27:16,251 --> 00:27:18,347
I have been well-treated.

573
00:27:19,858 --> 00:27:21,259
I have confessed

574
00:27:21,295 --> 00:27:24,496
that as a member of a well-armed
anti-Cardassian force

575
00:27:24,536 --> 00:27:26,973
organized
by Federation colonists

576
00:27:27,008 --> 00:27:30,277
I set an implosion device

577
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:33,048
that destroyed
the freighter <i>Bok'Nor.</i>

578
00:27:33,088 --> 00:27:36,550
I deeply regret participating
in this arbitrary attack

579
00:27:36,596 --> 00:27:39,831
that led to the deaths
of over 75 crewmen.

580
00:27:39,869 --> 00:27:45,040
To my wife and children...
I'm sorry

581
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:48,612
and... I love you.

582
00:27:52,431 --> 00:27:54,595
He would have
confessed to anything

583
00:27:54,635 --> 00:27:56,731
after you were through with him.

584
00:27:56,774 --> 00:27:57,833
On the contrary.

585
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:59,539
He confessed quite early

586
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:01,709
in the interrogation
procedure...

587
00:28:01,751 --> 00:28:03,721
far sooner than we expected.

588
00:28:03,755 --> 00:28:06,056
I believe he truly felt remorse.

589
00:28:06,094 --> 00:28:08,030
We want to talk
to him ourselves.

590
00:28:08,065 --> 00:28:09,694
Bring him in.

591
00:28:09,735 --> 00:28:13,904
Unfortunately, he committed
suicide in his cell.

592
00:28:26,773 --> 00:28:27,798
Come on, come on!

593
00:28:27,842 --> 00:28:28,810
It's all right!

594
00:28:28,844 --> 00:28:30,609
Dukat, get them out of here!

595
00:28:33,354 --> 00:28:34,914
Go on, we'll talk later.

596
00:28:34,957 --> 00:28:37,360
We can't let them
get away with this.

597
00:28:37,395 --> 00:28:39,297
We'll talk later.
You go on!

598
00:28:42,508 --> 00:28:44,501
Get him out of here.

599
00:28:58,576 --> 00:29:02,347
I knew him.

600
00:29:02,384 --> 00:29:05,755
Bill Samuels was a farmer.

601
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:10,530
He cultivated his land
for 20 years.

602
00:29:10,569 --> 00:29:14,031
He raised two children
on that land.

603
00:29:14,076 --> 00:29:18,040
He made something
out of that land

604
00:29:18,085 --> 00:29:20,488
and the Federation told him

605
00:29:20,524 --> 00:29:24,556
he had to give it all
up to the Cardassians.

606
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,767
Well, he just was not
willing to do that.

607
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:30,370
And it was people like him
who made both sides realize

608
00:29:30,412 --> 00:29:34,113
that some accommodation had
to be made for the colonies

609
00:29:34,153 --> 00:29:35,645
so they could stay.

610
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,287
The Cardassians
have no intention

611
00:29:38,329 --> 00:29:40,926
of allowing these
people to stay.

612
00:29:40,969 --> 00:29:45,434
They will either force them out
or they will kill them.

613
00:29:45,479 --> 00:29:47,780
It's already started.

614
00:29:47,817 --> 00:29:49,012
Not a day goes by

615
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:51,752
when there's not some
random act of violence

616
00:29:51,793 --> 00:29:52,988
against our people.

617
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:54,362
Every Federation colonist knows

618
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,895
you do not go out alone
at night.

619
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,537
Can you imagine living
under that kind of fear?

620
00:30:00,578 --> 00:30:02,947
If you're saying
the Cardassian authorities

621
00:30:02,984 --> 00:30:04,385
are not enforcing the laws...

622
00:30:04,421 --> 00:30:05,389
Enforcing the laws?

623
00:30:05,423 --> 00:30:07,120
The Cardassian authorities

624
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,030
were part of a mob that
stoned two colonists

625
00:30:10,066 --> 00:30:12,970
on the streets of Ropal City
three days ago.

626
00:30:13,006 --> 00:30:15,910
That's something the Federation
can take up with the Cardassians

627
00:30:15,946 --> 00:30:16,971
at the highest levels.

628
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:18,814
Well, that will help a lot.

629
00:30:20,155 --> 00:30:23,492
The word is
the Cardassian High Command

630
00:30:23,529 --> 00:30:26,866
is arming their colonists
to the teeth.

631
00:30:26,903 --> 00:30:28,429
You really think they'd risk

632
00:30:28,474 --> 00:30:30,638
sending weapons
into the Demilitarized Zone

633
00:30:30,678 --> 00:30:32,147
and breaking the treaty?

634
00:30:32,181 --> 00:30:35,518
I think they'll find
a way to do it

635
00:30:35,555 --> 00:30:37,719
that's not so obvious.

636
00:30:37,761 --> 00:30:41,964
Not long ago, we caught
the Cardassians shipping weapons

637
00:30:42,003 --> 00:30:46,342
to Bajoran extremists through
a third party, the Yridians.

638
00:30:46,446 --> 00:30:48,279
That sounds about right.

639
00:30:48,316 --> 00:30:51,915
Would the <i>Bok'Nor</i> have been
transferring weapons

640
00:30:51,958 --> 00:30:54,361
to someone else
to bring in here?

641
00:30:54,397 --> 00:30:57,461
If it was,
then the transfer was made

642
00:30:57,503 --> 00:30:59,564
before the ship
reached the station.

643
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:02,877
The cargo holds
of the <i>Bok'Nor</i> were empty.

644
00:31:02,916 --> 00:31:05,012
Do you think he did it?

645
00:31:05,053 --> 00:31:07,422
Samuels?

646
00:31:09,931 --> 00:31:11,730
I don't know.

647
00:31:11,768 --> 00:31:15,333
They could have forced him
to make a false confession

648
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,811
and then killed him.

649
00:31:16,847 --> 00:31:18,977
I don't think Gul Dukat
would drag me all the way here

650
00:31:19,017 --> 00:31:21,250
unless he knew
he could prove it.

651
00:31:21,289 --> 00:31:23,419
Well, maybe he did do it, Ben.
I don't know.

652
00:31:26,935 --> 00:31:28,928
Damn!

653
00:31:28,973 --> 00:31:31,774
I've got to go see his wife.

654
00:31:31,812 --> 00:31:35,810
I don't know
what I'm going to tell her.

655
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,725
It makes you pine for
the good old, dull days

656
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:43,863
in New Berlin, doesn't it?

657
00:31:43,906 --> 00:31:45,773
Sausage and beer all around

658
00:31:45,809 --> 00:31:48,144
and everyone's idea
of a good time

659
00:31:48,182 --> 00:31:51,155
was the mazurka festival.

660
00:31:51,189 --> 00:31:55,028
Gretchen and Jennifer had a ball
there together, didn't they?

661
00:31:55,063 --> 00:31:59,164
I'll never forget the sight
of you in those lederhosen.

662
00:31:59,206 --> 00:32:03,204
I still have the hat.

663
00:32:04,952 --> 00:32:08,483
Is there something larger
going on here, Cal?

664
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:14,733
Are these colonists organizing
some kind of terrorist campaign?

665
00:32:14,773 --> 00:32:16,140
Well, if they are

666
00:32:16,177 --> 00:32:19,241
they're not about
to tell me about it.

667
00:32:19,283 --> 00:32:21,219
But I'll tell you one thing,
Ben.

668
00:32:21,255 --> 00:32:22,348
Between you and me

669
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:25,761
those people have every right
to defend themselves.

670
00:32:25,797 --> 00:32:29,100
When the Federation
said good-bye to them

671
00:32:29,138 --> 00:32:31,547
they left them no other choice.

672
00:32:44,008 --> 00:32:46,981
You're very quiet, Commander.

673
00:32:47,015 --> 00:32:50,820
You knew about Samuels
before we left.

674
00:32:50,856 --> 00:32:53,726
I knew about his confession,
yes.

675
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,596
I didn't know he was...

676
00:32:55,633 --> 00:32:59,972
I was as surprised
as you were by his death.

677
00:33:00,009 --> 00:33:04,451
No one is going to buy
your suicide story.

678
00:33:04,486 --> 00:33:06,957
I don't care what he did.

679
00:33:06,992 --> 00:33:09,623
This kind of barbaric disregard
for life

680
00:33:09,664 --> 00:33:11,099
will gut this treaty.

681
00:33:11,133 --> 00:33:14,368
If it means anything,
I entirely agree.

682
00:33:14,407 --> 00:33:18,815
I told Evek he was a fool
to let Samuels die.

683
00:33:18,851 --> 00:33:22,347
A good interrogator doesn't
allow his subject to die.

684
00:33:22,392 --> 00:33:23,986
You lose the advantage.

685
00:33:24,029 --> 00:33:25,965
That's all
you're interested in, isn't it?

686
00:33:25,999 --> 00:33:27,092
The advantage.

687
00:33:27,136 --> 00:33:30,075
Oh, now, don't go spouting off

688
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:34,848
your holier-than-thou
Federation fair play dogma.

689
00:33:34,886 --> 00:33:38,987
And lest we forget,
your man was responsible

690
00:33:39,028 --> 00:33:41,898
for the deaths
of 78 innocent crewmen.

691
00:33:41,934 --> 00:33:44,030
What was the <i>Bok'Nor</i>
transporting?

692
00:33:44,073 --> 00:33:46,476
The <i>Bok'Nor</i> had just delivered

693
00:33:46,512 --> 00:33:49,348
14 metric tons of golside ore
to the Regulon system

694
00:33:49,384 --> 00:33:51,445
prior to its arrival
at the wormhole.

695
00:33:51,489 --> 00:33:53,220
You're sure
it wasn't carrying weapons?

696
00:33:53,326 --> 00:33:55,228
Weapons? To whom?

697
00:33:55,297 --> 00:33:57,996
To the Cardassians
in the Demilitarized Zone.

698
00:33:58,037 --> 00:33:59,734
No, the route of the <i>Bok'Nor</i>

699
00:33:59,774 --> 00:34:02,906
didn't take it anywhere near
the Demilitarized Zone.

700
00:34:02,948 --> 00:34:04,918
It could have rendezvoused
with someone else...

701
00:34:04,952 --> 00:34:06,113
with the Lissepians, maybe.

702
00:34:06,154 --> 00:34:08,181
They could have transferred
the weapons to them

703
00:34:08,259 --> 00:34:10,126
and they could have taken
the weapons to...

704
00:34:10,163 --> 00:34:11,131
Commander!

705
00:34:11,165 --> 00:34:12,896
I know you'd love to find

706
00:34:12,937 --> 00:34:15,636
some justification
for this mass murder

707
00:34:15,676 --> 00:34:18,011
to ease
your Federation conscience

708
00:34:18,048 --> 00:34:22,889
but if the <i>Bok'Nor</i> was carrying
weapons, I would know.

709
00:34:22,925 --> 00:34:28,370
And on the lives of my children,
I swear to you it was not.

710
00:34:30,442 --> 00:34:32,913
I didn't know you had children.

711
00:34:32,947 --> 00:34:35,441
Seven.

712
00:34:54,093 --> 00:34:55,392
I received your message.

713
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:57,024
How soon will it be available?

714
00:34:57,066 --> 00:34:59,537
My source can have
everything ready tomorrow.

715
00:34:59,571 --> 00:35:00,561
Say by 1400 hours.

716
00:35:00,608 --> 00:35:02,100
That's not soon enough.

717
00:35:02,145 --> 00:35:03,512
I must leave
the station tonight.

718
00:35:03,547 --> 00:35:04,572
You're leaving so soon?

719
00:35:04,617 --> 00:35:06,052
My plans have changed.

720
00:35:06,086 --> 00:35:09,082
Can your source have the
materials ready by tonight?

721
00:35:09,126 --> 00:35:10,595
I guess he'll have to.

722
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:13,762
I have your latinum,
if you'd like to count it.

723
00:35:13,804 --> 00:35:15,433
Are you trustworthy?

724
00:35:15,474 --> 00:35:17,273
I'm a Vulcan.

725
00:35:17,345 --> 00:35:18,438
Of course.

726
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,607
Just a little joke.

727
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,119
I'm sure it's all there.

728
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:22,587
Well, it wouldn't hurt

729
00:35:22,622 --> 00:35:24,957
to give it a quick
count, I suppose.

730
00:35:24,995 --> 00:35:27,626
I will have it brought
to your quarters.

731
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:31,300
I was looking forward
to showing you more ways

732
00:35:31,409 --> 00:35:33,812
to mix business with pleasure.

733
00:35:33,848 --> 00:35:36,149
Perhaps in the future.

734
00:35:36,185 --> 00:35:40,684
I do find you...
intriguing, Quark.

735
00:35:43,368 --> 00:35:45,896
"Intriguing."

736
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:50,480
You can stay in the guest suite
on Level H-2

737
00:35:50,518 --> 00:35:52,921
while you arrange transport
back to Cardassia.

738
00:35:52,955 --> 00:35:55,153
I'll have a security guard
meet you there.

739
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:57,791
Starfleet security,
if you don't mind, Commander.

740
00:35:57,833 --> 00:36:00,361
Some of the Bajoran deputies
are still around

741
00:36:00,439 --> 00:36:02,466
from the good old days
when I was in charge.

742
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:03,535
I understand.

743
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:05,139
If there's anything else
I can do

744
00:36:05,183 --> 00:36:07,016
to assist you in
your investigation...

745
00:36:07,053 --> 00:36:08,852
I think I can
handle it from here.

746
00:36:14,904 --> 00:36:16,168
Chief?

747
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:17,232
Yes, sir.

748
00:36:17,276 --> 00:36:18,505
I've got answers for you

749
00:36:18,545 --> 00:36:20,914
but I'm not sure
you're going to like them.

750
00:36:20,951 --> 00:36:22,352
It was an implosive device.

751
00:36:22,454 --> 00:36:24,083
Yes, sir.
And not only that...

752
00:36:24,125 --> 00:36:26,858
Not only that, it was
a Federation implosive device.

753
00:36:26,897 --> 00:36:29,630
Yes, sir. The traces
of mercassium we found

754
00:36:29,669 --> 00:36:32,266
were from the casing
of the device itself.

755
00:36:32,309 --> 00:36:34,370
It had to be
a Federation design.

756
00:36:34,413 --> 00:36:37,409
Get me Starfleet Command
on subspace.

757
00:36:46,774 --> 00:36:50,509
Commander, is there anything
you'd like me to communicate

758
00:36:50,549 --> 00:36:52,519
to the provisional
government?

759
00:36:52,554 --> 00:36:55,424
Tell them some reckless colonist
in the Demilitarized Zone

760
00:36:55,493 --> 00:36:56,518
blew up the <i>Bok'Nor.</i>

761
00:36:56,563 --> 00:36:59,034
There's no further threat
of Cardassian reprisals

762
00:36:59,068 --> 00:37:00,263
to Bajor.

763
00:37:00,304 --> 00:37:02,741
I'll advise all of our outposts
to stand down.

764
00:37:04,746 --> 00:37:09,154
Sir, are... are we facing
the prospect of war here?

765
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,716
Not if I can help it.

766
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,525
But that's what
the colonists are after.

767
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:15,058
I don't think they know
what they're after, Major.

768
00:37:15,103 --> 00:37:16,402
I just know
they have to be stopped

769
00:37:16,473 --> 00:37:18,204
and it's Starfleet's job
to stop them.

770
00:37:18,244 --> 00:37:19,736
Sir, I know this is
none of my business...

771
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,409
But you're going to give
me your opinion anyway.

772
00:37:21,517 --> 00:37:23,077
I don't know
what the Cardassians told you.

773
00:37:23,121 --> 00:37:25,957
They played a confession
of the man who planted the bomb.

774
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:28,021
A man they most likely
tortured to death.

775
00:37:28,064 --> 00:37:30,365
And you don't think you might
be playing into their hands?

776
00:37:30,403 --> 00:37:32,897
I've got people out there
killing people, Major.

777
00:37:32,942 --> 00:37:34,434
You suggest I turn
a blind eye to that?

778
00:37:34,545 --> 00:37:36,276
They don't have a right
to defend themselves?

779
00:37:36,316 --> 00:37:37,341
They've crossed the line!

780
00:37:37,386 --> 00:37:39,447
If Starfleet is unwilling
to defend their people...

781
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:41,152
They chose to live
with the Cardassians!

782
00:37:41,193 --> 00:37:42,218
Well, I didn't!

783
00:37:42,262 --> 00:37:44,027
But I lived with them
for 26 years

784
00:37:44,067 --> 00:37:45,468
before the liberation came.

785
00:37:45,569 --> 00:37:47,836
Every Bajoran lived with them
in constant fear.

786
00:37:47,875 --> 00:37:50,108
I know what those colonists
are going through.

787
00:37:50,147 --> 00:37:52,380
Most of all, I know

788
00:37:52,419 --> 00:37:54,252
that the Cardassians
can't be trusted

789
00:37:54,289 --> 00:37:56,783
to keep their side
of the bargain in this treaty.

790
00:37:56,828 --> 00:37:58,388
So, you'd suggest the Federation

791
00:37:58,432 --> 00:38:00,402
not keep our side
of the bargain either...

792
00:38:00,436 --> 00:38:02,065
perhaps by arming
these colonists?

793
00:38:02,106 --> 00:38:04,942
I can tell you
one thing for certain.

794
00:38:04,979 --> 00:38:08,612
The Cardassians are the enemy,
not your own colonists

795
00:38:08,654 --> 00:38:10,385
and if Starfleet
can't understand that

796
00:38:10,424 --> 00:38:12,189
then the Federation
is even more naive

797
00:38:12,228 --> 00:38:13,561
than I already think it is.

798
00:38:23,085 --> 00:38:24,748
I've been sent to relieve you.

799
00:38:24,789 --> 00:38:26,315
There must be some mistake.

800
00:38:26,359 --> 00:38:28,420
I just reported for duty
an hour...

801
00:38:35,045 --> 00:38:36,013
Yes?

802
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:37,140
Sorry to disturb you, sir

803
00:38:37,183 --> 00:38:39,381
but there's a message here
from Commander Sisko.

804
00:38:41,927 --> 00:38:44,694
We have been asked to escort you
to Airlock 11, sir.

805
00:38:44,733 --> 00:38:46,703
A Cardassian freighter
has just arrived.

806
00:38:46,738 --> 00:38:47,899
Is there a problem?

807
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,571
Apparently, another bomb
has been found and disarmed.

808
00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:05,908
Where's Commander Sisko?

809
00:39:05,947 --> 00:39:08,783
Comfortably asleep
in his quarters, I hope.

810
00:39:11,124 --> 00:39:13,254
Remember me?

811
00:39:13,296 --> 00:39:16,531
I take it
we're not about to board

812
00:39:16,637 --> 00:39:18,801
a Cardassian freighter.

813
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:46,949
What do you think
they're telling him?

814
00:39:47,053 --> 00:39:48,818
With two kidnappings
and a ship exploding

815
00:39:48,857 --> 00:39:49,847
in the course of a week

816
00:39:49,892 --> 00:39:51,691
I'm sure they've got
a few things to say.

817
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:52,698
It's their own fault.

818
00:39:52,732 --> 00:39:54,793
I've been warning them
since the beginning.

819
00:39:54,837 --> 00:39:57,901
What are you talking about...
their fault?

820
00:39:57,944 --> 00:39:59,777
You're in charge of security.

821
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:02,810
If you will let me be
in charge of security

822
00:40:02,855 --> 00:40:05,349
I will give you a safe station.

823
00:40:05,393 --> 00:40:07,762
You people tell me to do my job

824
00:40:07,799 --> 00:40:09,701
then give me a
Federation rule book

825
00:40:09,736 --> 00:40:11,672
listing all the things
I can't do.

826
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:13,177
Untie my hands

827
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,443
before you start
to blame me, Mr. O'Brien.

828
00:40:15,482 --> 00:40:17,817
I'm sure no one meant
to blame you, Odo.

829
00:40:17,854 --> 00:40:19,517
Give me the right
to set a curfew.

830
00:40:19,558 --> 00:40:21,927
Let me do more searches
of arriving passengers.

831
00:40:21,963 --> 00:40:23,398
Give me 50 more deputies.

832
00:40:23,433 --> 00:40:25,996
And this station will be
just the way it was

833
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:27,338
during the occupation.

834
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:28,844
Say what you like.

835
00:40:28,878 --> 00:40:30,347
It was safer then.

836
00:40:30,382 --> 00:40:32,409
Unless you happened
to be a Bajoran.

837
00:40:33,689 --> 00:40:34,953
I want a complete review

838
00:40:34,991 --> 00:40:37,519
of all security measures
on board this station.

839
00:40:37,565 --> 00:40:38,932
I'll be delighted
to accommodate you.

840
00:40:38,967 --> 00:40:40,527
What do we have from the guard?

841
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:43,635
He's given us a description
of the two who assaulted him...

842
00:40:43,678 --> 00:40:45,045
A Vulcan female
and a human male

843
00:40:45,081 --> 00:40:46,778
in a Starfleet officer's
uniform.

844
00:40:46,818 --> 00:40:49,449
We're trying to locate anyone
they might have contacted here.

845
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,460
How many ships left the station
during the night?

846
00:40:51,494 --> 00:40:52,689
Only two, sir.

847
00:40:52,731 --> 00:40:54,462
The Bardeezan merchant ship
and a Galador freighter.

848
00:40:54,501 --> 00:40:56,027
What were their destinations?

849
00:40:56,072 --> 00:40:58,202
The Bardeezans went
through the wormhole.

850
00:40:58,243 --> 00:41:00,236
The freighter is operating
on a trade route

851
00:41:00,281 --> 00:41:02,548
between Galador II
and Farius Prime.

852
00:41:02,586 --> 00:41:04,180
I'm guessing these people

853
00:41:04,223 --> 00:41:06,854
wouldn't take Dukat
through the wormhole.

854
00:41:06,895 --> 00:41:10,232
They'd head back to the
Demilitarized Zone with him.

855
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:12,206
Dax, check the Galador
ship's registry

856
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,675
and make sure it's in order.

857
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,735
Chief, see if you

858
00:41:14,779 --> 00:41:17,182
can identify its warp signature
from our sensor records.

859
00:41:17,218 --> 00:41:18,778
No problem, Commander.

860
00:41:18,821 --> 00:41:19,789
I've got it.

861
00:41:19,823 --> 00:41:22,021
Last known course.

862
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:26,401
The computer's showing it was
on a bearing 216 mark 177.

863
00:41:26,438 --> 00:41:27,737
As it left our sensor range

864
00:41:27,775 --> 00:41:29,574
it was still heading
for Farius Prime.

865
00:41:30,982 --> 00:41:34,251
Major, send a message
to Farius Prime.

866
00:41:34,289 --> 00:41:36,020
If that ship shows up,
and I doubt that it will

867
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,030
I want to know it right away.

868
00:41:38,064 --> 00:41:40,262
I could send the warp signature
out over subspace.

869
00:41:40,302 --> 00:41:42,067
You could make it
a general transmission.

870
00:41:42,106 --> 00:41:44,099
If it changes course,
someone should spot it.

871
00:41:44,143 --> 00:41:45,270
Do it.

872
00:41:45,313 --> 00:41:46,646
It's a phony.

873
00:41:46,682 --> 00:41:49,883
The Galadorans don't have
any ships in this sector.

874
00:41:49,923 --> 00:41:51,256
The registry is forged.

875
00:41:51,293 --> 00:41:53,821
Doctor, Major, you're with me.

876
00:41:53,865 --> 00:41:55,732
Odo, send a message
to Commander Hudson

877
00:41:55,769 --> 00:41:58,332
at the Volon colony that I'm
moving in his direction

878
00:41:58,375 --> 00:42:00,038
on the assumption
that Dukat will be taken

879
00:42:00,078 --> 00:42:01,137
to the Demilitarized Zone.

880
00:42:01,181 --> 00:42:02,775
Give him the warp signature
of the ship.

881
00:42:02,818 --> 00:42:03,786
Aye, sir.

882
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:07,625
Commander, we just received
a general subspace transmission

883
00:42:07,662 --> 00:42:09,758
from somewhere
in the Demilitarized Zone.

884
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,898
A group there is taking credit
for the kidnapping of Dukat.

885
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,569
They're calling themselves...

886
00:42:14,611 --> 00:42:15,806
"the Maquis."

887
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,743
Commander, a Klingon freighter

888
00:42:32,784 --> 00:42:35,278
two light-years
from the Demilitarized Zone

889
00:42:35,323 --> 00:42:36,883
has ID'd the warp signature.

890
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:39,831
The ship did change course,
just as you predicted.

891
00:42:39,866 --> 00:42:41,597
Transmit
their last known coordinates

892
00:42:41,636 --> 00:42:42,900
and heading to us, Chief.

893
00:42:44,042 --> 00:42:45,341
Acknowledged.

894
00:42:45,378 --> 00:42:48,145
Let us know if anyone else
picks up their signature.

895
00:42:48,184 --> 00:42:49,209
Aye, sir.

896
00:42:49,253 --> 00:42:50,312
O'Brien out.

897
00:42:50,356 --> 00:42:51,620
Set a new course, Major.

898
00:42:51,658 --> 00:42:54,027
Yes, sir.

899
00:42:54,064 --> 00:42:56,125
Their heading takes them
into the badlands.

900
00:42:56,169 --> 00:42:57,228
Badlands?

901
00:42:57,271 --> 00:42:59,241
It's a stretch
of the Cardassian border

902
00:42:59,308 --> 00:43:00,241
ships try to avoid.

903
00:43:00,345 --> 00:43:02,144
A lot of plasma storms
in the area.

904
00:43:02,182 --> 00:43:05,815
A few ships have been lost there
in the past year or two.

905
00:43:05,856 --> 00:43:08,726
Sounds like the perfect place
for a hideout.

906
00:43:08,763 --> 00:43:10,096
Excuse me, sir.

907
00:43:10,132 --> 00:43:13,128
What do you plan to do
if we catch up with them?

908
00:43:13,172 --> 00:43:16,441
After all, these Maquis
are Federation colonists.

909
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,507
We're going
to get Gul Dukat back

910
00:43:18,552 --> 00:43:20,112
by any means necessary.

911
00:43:20,154 --> 00:43:23,889
Even if we have to fire
on our own people?

912
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:29,033
Long-range sensors are picking
up the warp signature.

913
00:43:29,074 --> 00:43:31,375
It leads to an M-Class asteroid.

914
00:43:31,413 --> 00:43:32,905
Take us there.

915
00:43:42,103 --> 00:43:44,802
Scanning the surface.

916
00:43:44,842 --> 00:43:46,709
I've located the ship.

917
00:43:46,746 --> 00:43:48,010
Those are human life signs.

918
00:43:48,049 --> 00:43:49,609
Is there a Cardassian
among them?

919
00:43:49,653 --> 00:43:50,746
No, sir.

920
00:43:50,788 --> 00:43:52,724
Prepare to beam down.

921
00:44:15,108 --> 00:44:19,049
I'm glad to see you had
no trouble finding us, Ben.

922
00:44:19,084 --> 00:44:22,855
It seems that one disaster
after another

923
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:26,526
keeps bringing us
back together again.
