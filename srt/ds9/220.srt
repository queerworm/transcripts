1
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,742
(<i> instrument whirring</i> )

2
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:46,045
The Cardassian
Freighter<i> Bok'Nor</i>

3
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:49,257
is requesting permission
to depart Upper Pylon 1
in three minutes.

4
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:51,468
We have an incoming
Bolian vessel

5
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,345
at coordinates
101 mark 38.

6
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:54,847
Give the<i> Bok'Nor</i>
a clear trajectory

7
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:56,139
out of the
traffic pattern.

8
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,850
Acknowledged.

9
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,810
Feel like getting together
for dinner tonight?

10
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,646
Can't. I'm having dinner
with Captain Boday.

11
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:05,691
The Gallamite? You're going
out on a date with him?

12
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:08,027
Is something wrong with that?

13
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:10,696
No... not at all.

14
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:12,447
He happens to be brilliant.

15
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,783
His brain is twice the size
of yours and mine.

16
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,744
I know, I've seen it.

17
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:20,330
It's not his fault Gallamites
have transparent skulls.

18
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,290
No, it's not.

19
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,921
It's... not exactly the view
I want to have with dinner.

20
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:29,297
You know, Kira,
sometimes I think you place

21
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,759
too much emphasis
on how men look.

22
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,343
What's that supposed to mean?

23
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,094
Nothing.

24
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:37,556
Look, when I kiss a man
good night

25
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:39,892
I like to know
where I'm kissing him.

26
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:43,353
I guess seven lifetimes gives me
a somewhat broader perspective.

27
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,313
Well, since
I just have one lifetime

28
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,982
I have to be
a little more particular

29
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,483
about whom I go out with.

30
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,861
I never said
I wasn't particular.

31
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:53,196
I'm not the one
who dates Ferengis.

32
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,074
And what's that
supposed to mean?

33
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:56,491
Nothing.

34
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,828
(<i> console beeping</i> )

35
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:02,497
Releasing docking clamps
at Upper Pylon 1.

36
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:05,918
That's funny.

37
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:08,211
I'm picking up elevated...

38
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,714
DS9 to<i> Bok'Nor.</i>
Shut down your engines.

39
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,716
Repeat.
Shut down your engines!

40
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,179
Report.

41
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,515
Some kind of impulse overload.
Checking.

42
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:23,435
Ops to all
engineering personnel.
Report to rescue stations.

43
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,729
We have an S.I.D.
in progress.

44
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:28,065
There's nothing left of it.

45
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:30,776
There's no one left to rescue.

46
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,781
O'BRIEN:
Kelindide, rodinium--

47
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,824
nothing unusual
there.

48
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,410
All materials commonly used
in Cardassian ship construction.

49
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,122
Maybe it was a malfunction
in the impulse generator.

50
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:49,790
I'd like to be able
to tell you that, Major,

51
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,458
but it's too soon
to be sure.

52
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,418
I can't believe
the Cardassians

53
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,462
have waited this long for
an official explanation.

54
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,672
SISKO:
Anything, Chief?

55
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,716
No sign of an
explosive device yet, sir.

56
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,636
I've got every Admiral within
subspace range on my back.

57
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,513
Can I at least tell them
that it looks like an accident?

58
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,224
Well, I wouldn't
do that yet.

59
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,559
When?
I'll let you know, sir.

60
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,436
Anything from the
Cardassians, Commander?

61
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,647
Not a word.
All Bajoran outposts

62
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,399
have been put on alert
for retaliatory strikes.

63
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,526
The provisional
government has
made a statement

64
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,570
disavowing any
responsibility.

65
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,363
Maybe it really<i> was</i>
an accident.

66
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,991
I mean, it is a possibility.

67
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,826
An accident
involving

68
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,829
a Cardassian ship
in Bajoran space?

69
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,747
If I were a Cardassian
I wouldn't easily accept...

70
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,040
O'BRIEN:
That's odd.

71
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,792
SISKO:
What?

72
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,919
I'm picking up traces
of a mercassium compound.

73
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,672
Mercassium?
There shouldn't have been

74
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,423
any mercassium
on board that ship.

75
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,676
O'BRIEN: Well, there was.
Meaning?

76
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,219
I'm not quite sure yet.

77
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,847
Is mercassium
some kind of explosive?

78
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,183
No, it's a synthetic
composite

79
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,768
used in shield generator
construction
by the Federation.

80
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,353
We don't share that
technology with anyone.

81
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:58,399
Chief, I don't think you're
going to find any evidence
of an explosive device.

82
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,486
Lieutenant, respectfully,
these kinds of things
take time, and I...

83
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,281
I don't think you're going
to find any evidence
of an explosive device

84
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:07,742
because I'm pretty sure
it was an implosive
protomatter device

85
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,453
designed to match
the impulse signature.

86
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,248
Just before the explosion,
I picked up a sudden increase

87
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:15,083
in their fusion rate.

88
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,294
I've been trying to find
any sign of malfunction

89
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:20,463
in the<i> Bok'Nor's</i>
engines to explain it,
but there just isn't one.

90
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:23,008
This doesn't look
like an accident.

91
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,843
The fusion shock
had to be caused

92
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:27,386
by something external
to the impulse drive system.

93
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:30,389
If a protomatter device
was attached to the cross-feeds

94
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:31,975
that could have created
the overload

95
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,518
and we'd never see
any sign of it.

96
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,562
Can you prove
that's what happened?

97
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,190
Maybe, if we can get
a high resolution spectra

98
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,192
of the impulse debris,
but that's going to take...

99
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:43,945
Time. Yes, I know.
Get it started.

100
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,614
I'll tell the admirals.
Sisko out.

101
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:50,202
Benjamin.

102
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:51,452
Ah.

103
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:55,374
Cal, thanks for coming
on such short notice.

104
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:57,376
I wish it didn't take
a disaster like this

105
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:59,378
to bring us
back together again.

106
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:00,879
Hi, Calvin.

107
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,549
Jadzia Dax.

108
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,551
Dax?!

109
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,136
(<i> laughing</i> )

110
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,930
My goodness!

111
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,557
Well, you look
a lot better than
when last I saw you.

112
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,184
Chief of Security Odo.

113
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,186
Commander Calvin Hudson,

114
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,646
Starfleet's attaché to
the Federation colonies

115
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,148
in the new
Demilitarized Zone.

116
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,234
You must be
concerned about

117
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:24,903
the colonies' security
at a time like this.

118
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:26,529
Well, we haven't noticed
any unusual deployment

119
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,240
from the Cardassians
along the border.

120
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,285
Neither have we, and that's
what's got me worried.

121
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:32,953
Let's go into my office.

122
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,789
Lieutenant, I don't
have time this trip,

123
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:39,084
but you and I have a few stories
to catch up on.

124
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,419
Next time.

125
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:42,503
Next time.

126
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,672
That woman knows
more about me

127
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,383
than any woman ever has.

128
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,260
More than my wife, even.

129
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,011
Tell me about it.

130
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:53,140
Don't you find things
a little uncomfortable?

131
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,268
Oh, no, she's
a good officer.

132
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:58,061
Yes, but Curzon was...

133
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:00,105
She's not Curzon.

134
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,565
Now, you two aren't, I mean...

135
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,484
(<i> both laughing</i> )

136
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,070
Oh, no.
She may not be Curzon,

137
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,571
but she<i> is</i> Dax.

138
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,199
Yes, that would be
extremely...

139
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,243
strange.

140
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:16,621
So, Ben, how is Jake?

141
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,665
As tall as me.
No!

142
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,376
He throws inside to knock
the old man off the plate.

143
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,003
A little chin music, huh?

144
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,713
Yeah, he's growing up
too fast.

145
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,882
Yeah.

146
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,305
It must have been difficult
for you.

147
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:36,683
At least I didn't have
a child to raise by myself.

148
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:40,520
Well, we kind of helped
each other through it.

149
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,192
I heard about Gretchen.

150
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,735
I wanted to be there for you.

151
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:51,281
There was just
no way to get back.

152
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:54,117
I know that, Ben.

153
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,661
You know,
I was hoping when they
sent me to the colonies

154
00:08:56,661 --> 00:09:00,332
that you and I would
have a little time
for some R&amp;R together.

155
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:02,042
Who's got R&amp;R time?

156
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,668
I know.

157
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:07,088
You can't imagine how
my life has changed

158
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,924
since the Federation
abandoned these colonies.

159
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,177
Abandoned them?
Doesn't your presence...?

160
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:14,637
My presence there is a joke.

161
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,974
I am supposed to help
these colonies function

162
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,101
under the terms
of the new treaty.

163
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,521
Now, Ben, what the hell
does that mean?

164
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:26,441
I thought these colonists
wanted to stay, that they
refused to evacuate.

165
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:30,111
The treaty gave away
their territory
to the Cardassians--

166
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,323
territory that these people
had invested their lives in.

167
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,283
Now, Ben, if you
knew them as I do,

168
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:38,661
you'd know why they can't leave.
It's a bad treaty.

169
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,830
The Federation
gave away too much.

170
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,790
Several Cardassian colonies

171
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,293
wanted to stay on the Federation
side of the zone, too.

172
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,837
It seemed like
a reasonable compromise.

173
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,881
Oh, yes,
the Cardassians would love

174
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:52,217
to have their colonies
in our territory

175
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,635
because they know
we'd protect them,

176
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:57,680
but they have no intention
of doing the same for ours.

177
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,683
A number of admirals
at Starfleet Command are worried

178
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,144
the destruction
of the<i> Bok'Nor</i>  might
jeopardize the treaty.

179
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,854
Oh, are they really?

180
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,606
As the two ranking officers

181
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,400
along the Cardassian border

182
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,152
we've been asked to assess
the potential risk.

183
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,904
There is no risk, Ben.

184
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:14,822
None.

185
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,991
I have been dealing
with the Cardassians

186
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,702
most of my professional life,
and believe me,

187
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,372
they are very pleased with
what they got from the treaty.

188
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,999
They are not about
to risk losing

189
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:28,503
all they've gained
by sending forces into the zone.

190
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:31,256
They're much too slick for that.

191
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:35,135
If I were you, I'd be
very concerned with security

192
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,471
along the
Bajoran border.

193
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:43,977
Are you surprised they haven't
responded at all yet?

194
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,271
Well, Ben, you and I both know

195
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:49,441
they never let you see
what you expect to see.

196
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:51,818
They'll respond.

197
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,752
Quarters have been arranged
through discreet channels--

198
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,421
Deck 7, Section 4-G.

199
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,173
I suggest you keep
a low profile

200
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,882
until your ship arrives.

201
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,741
Can I get you something?

202
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,743
You are Quark,
aren't you?

203
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,787
I assure you,
the warrant
is out of date.

204
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,623
I cleared that
matter up months ago.

205
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,416
Warrant?

206
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,169
Oh, uh, when you
recognized me,
I assumed...

207
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,672
You are counting your receipts.
It is logical to conclude

208
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:55,714
you are the proprietor
of the establishment.

209
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:59,219
You're very observant.
What can I do for you?

210
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,929
I was hoping to discuss
a business proposition.

211
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:05,183
With me? Uh, perhaps
I should explain

212
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,060
about that slip
of the tongue.

213
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,646
Your past
is of no consequence to me.

214
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,606
I'm delighted to
hear you say that,

215
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:13,692
because nothing
would please me more

216
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,985
than to make a fresh start
with the Vulcans,
Ms., uh...?

217
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:19,322
Sakonna.
Sakonna.

218
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:23,660
Such a handsome name
for such a handsome
young woman.

219
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,704
What will you
have to drink?

220
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:28,998
Wait a minute.
I have just the thing.

221
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,958
Vulcan port.

222
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,837
Three centuries old.

223
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:38,425
Very rare,
very expensive.

224
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,093
Shall I pour
you a glass?
No.

225
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,387
Not even a taste?
It's exquisite.

226
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,763
I'm not thirsty,
thus, I see no reason
to have a drink.

227
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:48,476
Well, it'll be right here
should you develop a thirst.

228
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:52,021
Now, uh, you mentioned
a business proposition.

229
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:55,024
It is a private matter.
I would rather not
discuss it here.

230
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,318
Then we can discuss
it over dinner.

231
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,613
That is, we can plan
the business meeting

232
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:02,198
to coincide with
when you think you
might get hungry.

233
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,951
That would be acceptable.
That would be wonderful.

234
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,661
How does 8:00
sound to your tummy?

235
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,329
I will return then.

236
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,295
And, by the way,

237
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:20,675
I'd love to melt
that cold Vulcan heart of yours.

238
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,013
Bleech.

239
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,018
Oh!

240
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:34,147
Oh, here, allow me.

241
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,316
Thank you.

242
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,859
Ah! Oh...

243
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,246
Jake-o?

244
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,666
Your son is not here,
Commander.

245
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,208
Dukat.

246
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,586
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.

247
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,838
Where is he?
Who? Your son?

248
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:02,383
How would I know?
I just...

249
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:05,094
Commander, you don't...?

250
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:12,893
Do you think I would ever
do anything to harm your son?

251
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,937
I think
you're capable of anything.

252
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:19,317
You wound me, sir.
I'm here as your friend.

253
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:21,194
Sisko to Kira.

254
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,988
Please do not do anything
hastily, Commander.

255
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,239
We must talk in private.

256
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,741
KIRA:
Yes, Commander?

257
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,785
Major, I want you
to find Jake.

258
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,745
Is he missing?
I don't know.

259
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:32,872
Find out where he
is and let me know.

260
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,041
Understood.

261
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,084
How the hell did
you get in here?

262
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,253
I was an unregistered passenger

263
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,964
on a Kotakian ship
that docked here this morning.

264
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,050
I slipped in
through the cargo bay.

265
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:48,513
Hmm. And made your way here
without anyone seeing you.

266
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:53,434
I was the Commander
of this station
for almost ten years.

267
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,604
When one knows
the various corridors

268
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,981
and passageways as well as I...

269
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:03,695
Oh, by the way,
I love what you've done
with these quarters.

270
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:06,364
Kira to Sisko.
Jake's fine, Commander.

271
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,324
He's with Nog,
watching the women

272
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,660
coming off the Bajoran transport
at Docking Bay 1.

273
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,953
Shall I have him
brought to your quarters?

274
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,915
No, that's all right.
Thank you, Major.

275
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,876
Sisko out.

276
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:20,044
There. You see?

277
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,921
Safe and sound.

278
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,509
What are you doing here?

279
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:28,052
(<i> sighing</i> )

280
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,096
(<i> sighs again</i> )

281
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,724
You have a problem.

282
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:34,726
Do I?
The<i> Bok'Nor?</i>

283
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:37,228
Is this the Cardassian
Central Command's way

284
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:39,564
of responding
to my communiqués?

285
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,107
On the contrary.

286
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,526
Central Command
has no idea I'm here.

287
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:47,113
It's true.
I'm here unofficially

288
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:50,450
to help you find out
the truth about the<i> Bok'Nor.</i>

289
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,034
Why would you want to help me?

290
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,537
Because I already know
the truth.

291
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,330
Do you know who's responsible?
I do.

292
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,583
Who?
You are.

293
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:03,630
Well, not you personally,
Commander.

294
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,132
I know you
to be an honorable man.

295
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,134
You're not one to sneak around,

296
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:12,889
attaching implosion devices
to impulse engines.

297
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:15,308
But believe it or not,

298
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:19,019
there are those of your brethren
who are willing

299
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,772
to do such things.

300
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:26,861
Morally superior
human beings

301
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:29,697
and other members
of the Federation.

302
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:33,242
I'm supposed
to take your word for that?

303
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:37,497
Of course not.
It's my job to convince you

304
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,707
so you can clean up
your own house

305
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:43,085
instead of forcing us
to do it for you,

306
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:47,006
which would certainly
endanger the new treaty.

307
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,634
We'll need
one of your runabouts.

308
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,761
Where are
<i>we</i> going?

309
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,346
The Volon colonies.

310
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,348
The Demilitarized Zone?

311
00:16:55,348 --> 00:17:00,812
Hmm. Not so demilitarized,
I'm afraid.

312
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:12,406
I can't help but notice
that my controls
are not illuminated.

313
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,868
Isn't it customary
for both seats

314
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:17,328
to be turned on, so that
I may pilot the craft

315
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,079
in the event of
an emergency?

316
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,624
If there's an emergency,
I guess you're out of luck.

317
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,626
Commander, I'm not
going to sit here

318
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,962
and steal your little
technical secrets,

319
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,547
I promise you.

320
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,465
I appreciate
your assurances,

321
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,092
but Cardassians are famous
for their photographic memories.

322
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:34,220
Oh, so you turn
off my controls

323
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,305
so I don't have
enough light

324
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,641
to take my photograph,
is that it?

325
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,810
I've heard they put
Cardassian children

326
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,520
in intense
mind training programs

327
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,981
when they're
four years old.
Is that true?

328
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:47,358
The Cardassian
educational system

329
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:49,360
is unparalleled
in the quadrant.

330
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,780
If you don't mind taking
the joy out of growing up.

331
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,199
Education is power.

332
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,117
Joy is vulnerability.

333
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,119
What?

334
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,956
Your reaction
surprises me, Commander.

335
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,666
I thought you
would understand.

336
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,793
Of all the humans
I've met,

337
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,128
you strike me as
the most joyless

338
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,006
and the least
vulnerable.

339
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,841
I am when I'm with you.

340
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:14,052
(<i> laughing</i> )

341
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:15,469
Well said.

342
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,471
But, in truth,
I'm looking forward

343
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,974
to getting to know you
better on this journey.

344
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,602
I think we know each other
well enough.

345
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:25,104
Is that a ramscoop control

346
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,314
or a deflector
grid panel?

347
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:31,778
Just curious.

348
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,780
It really doesn't matter.

349
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,908
Cardassian pursuit vessels
are years ahead of this design.

350
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:38,451
(<i> console beeping</i> )

351
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,244
What is it?

352
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,997
Long-range sensors
are picking up
a distress signal.

353
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,457
From who?

354
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,250
A Federation
merchant vessel,

355
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,461
under attack
by Cardassians.

356
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:49,879
(<i> sighs</i> )

357
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:54,759
I'm reading
two Cardassian attack vessels

358
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,136
just inside
the Demilitarized Zone.

359
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,764
That's not possible.
I promise you, Commander,

360
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,891
we would not violate the treaty.

361
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:04,852
The merchant vessel's
com links are down.

362
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,980
I can't raise them.

363
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,483
Computer, fix source coordinates
of the distress signal

364
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,735
and lay in a new course--
warp 3.

365
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:15,488
I hope you don't mind.
Not at all.

366
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:18,866
I'm as curious about this
as you are.

367
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,998
What type of Cardassian
ships are they?

368
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,833
Patrol cruisers?
No, much smaller.

369
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,835
They look
like shuttlecraft.

370
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:32,171
Cardassian shuttles
attacking a Federation
merchant ship?

371
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,841
They seem to be armed
with Galor-class phaser banks.

372
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:38,136
They must be from
Cardassian colonies in
the Demilitarized Zone.

373
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:40,262
Hail them.

374
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:43,265
No response.
Open a channel.

375
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,018
Go ahead.

376
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:48,855
To the pilots of
the Cardassian attack vessels.

377
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:51,899
This is Gul Dukat,
Commander of the Second Order.

378
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,860
Please respond.

379
00:19:57,989 --> 00:20:03,410
This is Gul Dukat, security
identification: A-D-L 4-Zero.

380
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:07,414
I order you to immediately
disengage your attack.

381
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:12,003
We're still two minutes away.

382
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:15,089
The Federation vessel's shields
are down to 40 percent.

383
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:17,091
Hail those
Cardassians again.

384
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:19,927
I don't know who you are
or where you come from,

385
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,763
but you're going to pay
for this, I promise you.

386
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,641
Answer me immediately,
or I personally will fire

387
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,727
the photons that
will destroy you.

388
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:32,732
Arm the photons.

389
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,443
The photon launcher is...
I know.

390
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,905
I knew all about
these controls before
I ever came on board.

391
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:41,074
Tell me when we're
in torpedo range.

392
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,783
Stand by.

393
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,494
I'm picking up another ship
moving toward them.

394
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:50,290
That's a Federation
signature, I believe,
Commander.

395
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,126
It sure isn't
from Starfleet.

396
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:55,004
I've never seen a ship
configuration like that before.

397
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:59,050
It almost seems
like someone has modified
an old support courier.

398
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,426
Hmm.

399
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,887
Hailing them.

400
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:04,638
No response.

401
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,934
They fired torpedoes.

402
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:10,394
What kind of civilian
vessel that size

403
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,855
would be carrying photon?

404
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:16,483
Something from one of
your colonies, perhaps?

405
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:24,324
Now do you begin
to see, Commander,

406
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:27,203
that without any help
from either one of us,

407
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,205
they've managed
to start

408
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,624
their own little
war out here?

409
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,221
QUARK:
I hope you're hungry.

410
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,556
I've planned
a wonderful meal for us,

411
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,225
starting with
<i>plomeek</i> soup,

412
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,310
which I know is
a traditional Vulcan favorite,

413
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:56,107
followed by jumbo
Romulan mollusks.

414
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:59,068
You can't get those back
on Vulcan anymore, can you?

415
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:01,070
Do you eat in this grand
a manner every night?

416
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,864
Certainly not; this
is a special occasion.
It is?

417
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:06,659
The commencement
of a new business
relationship

418
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,162
is the most special
occasion for any Ferengi.

419
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:13,249
It's a cause for opening
great bottles of wine,

420
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:17,170
dancing into the wee,
small hours of the morning.

421
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,088
We'll let it breathe
for a few minutes.

422
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:21,465
Very well;
I will attempt to respect

423
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:24,177
some of your cultural
idiosyncrasies.

424
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:27,888
I will drink the wine,
but I won't dance.

425
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:31,309
Maybe you'll change
your mind after
you drink the wine.

426
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:33,060
No, I won't.

427
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,937
Oh, come on.

428
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:38,732
Somewhere inside that cool,
controlled exterior of yours

429
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:42,528
there is a wild woman
screaming to get out.

430
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,113
Maybe by the end
of the night

431
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:45,990
you'll be dancing
on the table tops.

432
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,868
Maybe not.

433
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:52,454
Is it appropriate to begin
our business discussion now?

434
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,790
Rule of Acquisition
Number 214:

435
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,918
Never begin a
business negotiation
on an empty stomach.

436
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,503
Rule of Acquisition?

437
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:03,216
Yes. Every Ferengi
business transaction

438
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:06,719
is governed
by 285 Rules of Acquisition

439
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:11,265
to ensure a fair and honest deal
for all parties concerned.

440
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:13,184
Well, most of them, anyway.

441
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:16,062
Commendable-- to create
a code of behavior

442
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:17,730
for business transactions...

443
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,148
Is logical.

444
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:21,025
And quite reassuring.

445
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:24,028
Do Vulcans have
anything similar?

446
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:27,031
In structure, it reminds one
of the Vulcan Bill of Rights,

447
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:30,117
which guarantees
the fundamental
personal freedoms

448
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,744
of every Vulcan citizen.

449
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,411
Same thing exactly.

450
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:35,581
May I propose a toast?

451
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:38,458
Is this another
cultural idiosyncrasy?

452
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:42,296
Yes. You know,
I can't describe

453
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:44,422
the honor I feel
at this moment.

454
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:47,425
It's rare that a
Ferengi and a Vulcan

455
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:49,220
can overcome their
inherent differences

456
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,931
to see eye-to-eye
as we are doing.

457
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:55,059
I've always had
the greatest respect
for Vulcans,

458
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:56,852
even though
the few I've met

459
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,063
haven't exactly felt
the same way about me.

460
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:02,275
You're a noble people...

461
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:04,526
and I salute you.

462
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:18,456
Now then, what kind
of business proposition

463
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:20,209
do you have in mind?

464
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:21,835
I wish to procure weapons.

465
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:24,088
I beg your pardon?

466
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:26,882
Guns, phaser banks,
photon torpedoes...

467
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,260
Shh.
...troop transports,

468
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:32,096
and a number of
cobalt-thorium devices.

469
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:35,308
My list is quite extensive.
You're a gun runner?

470
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:37,935
I am prepared
to pay in latinum

471
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:40,562
and I will very likely need
a continuous supply

472
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,231
for the foreseeable future.

473
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,403
You're not like other Vulcans,
are you?

474
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:59,081
The Federation merchant ship
refused to be boarded!

475
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:01,583
So your ships just
decided to open fire?

476
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:05,087
It was clear the Federation ship
was carrying weapons through
the Demilitarized Zone.

477
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:08,382
That ship was carrying
medical supplies to Saltok IV.

478
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:10,926
Ben, what are
you doing here?

479
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:14,347
I'm not sure yet.
Gul Dukat asked me
to accompany him.

480
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:18,017
Dukat--
no one informed us
<i>you</i> were coming.

481
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:21,645
I decided an impromptu visit
would be preferable

482
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:25,149
so you wouldn't be bothered
with special preparations.

483
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:26,692
I see.

484
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,402
Commander Sisko,
you know

485
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:32,031
my counterpart from
the colonies, Gul Evek.

486
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:34,367
I'm glad you're here to
listen to this, Commander.

487
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:36,410
We monitored the attack
on the way in.

488
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:39,205
Yes, "monitor"
is the proper word

489
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:42,582
because none of the ships
would respond to our hails.

490
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:45,961
Even the Cardassian pilots
refused to acknowledge<i> me.</i>

491
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,464
A strange voice from
a Federation runabout.

492
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:51,467
I gave them my
security identification.

493
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,886
Well, obviously, they
had their hands full.

494
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,721
With an unprovoked attack.

495
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,515
Unprovoked, was it?

496
00:25:57,515 --> 00:25:59,766
Do you deny that
the Federation is engaging

497
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:02,061
in organized
terrorist activities

498
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:05,731
against the Cardassian people,
deliberately undermining
this treaty?

499
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:08,275
The Federation does not conduct
secret wars.

500
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,861
Then perhaps you can explain
where the Federation ship
came from--

501
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:13,447
the one outfitted
with photon torpedoes.

502
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:14,990
Explain why your
ships were armed

503
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,616
with Galor-class
phaser banks.

504
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,411
They have a right
to defend themselves

505
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:20,329
against organized
terrorist activities.

506
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:21,914
I haven't heard any proof yet

507
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,999
of organized
terrorist activities.

508
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,418
Because there is none.

509
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:26,960
On the contrary.

510
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,670
We have the confession

511
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,464
of the Federation terrorist

512
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:32,758
responsible for the destruction
of the<i> Bok'Nor</i>

513
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,301
at your station, Commander.

514
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,429
Confession?

515
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:42,726
A 43-year-old male human,
William Patrick Samuels,

516
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,562
born Bergen, Norway,
Earth...

517
00:26:44,562 --> 00:26:47,898
We know who he is.
What have you done
with him?

518
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:51,193
Came to the Federation colony
on Volon II 20 years ago.

519
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:53,862
Married, wife's name Louise,
two female children,

520
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:56,240
aged 14 and 12.

521
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,326
He was quite cooperative
once we apprehended
him on Deep Space 9.

522
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,420
CARDASSIAN:
Begin.

523
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,464
My name is William Samuels.

524
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:16,302
I am being held for crimes
against the Cardassian people.

525
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:18,220
I have been well-treated.

526
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,515
I have confessed

527
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:24,393
that as a member of a well-armed
anti-Cardassian force

528
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:27,771
organized
by Federation colonists

529
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,232
I set an implosion device

530
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:32,650
that destroyed
the freighter<i> Bok'Nor.</i>

531
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:36,363
I deeply regret participating
in this arbitrary attack

532
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:39,657
that led to the deaths
of over 75 crewmen.

533
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:45,080
To my wife and children...
I'm sorry

534
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,459
and... I love you.

535
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:56,674
He would have confessed
to anything after you
were through with him.

536
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:58,802
On the contrary.
He confessed quite early

537
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,846
in the interrogation
procedure--

538
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:02,973
far sooner than we expected.

539
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:05,058
I believe he truly felt remorse.

540
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,894
We want to talk
to him ourselves.

541
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,480
Bring him in.

542
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,399
Unfortunately,
he committed suicide

543
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,942
in his cell.

544
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:24,328
(<i> yelling</i> )

545
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:28,706
Come on, come on!
It's all right!

546
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:30,459
Dukat, get them
out of here!

547
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,796
Go on, we'll talk later.

548
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,507
We can't let them
get away with this.

549
00:28:36,507 --> 00:28:38,425
We'll talk later.
You go on!

550
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,473
Get him out of here.

551
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,239
I knew him.

552
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:05,994
Bill Samuels
was a farmer.

553
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:10,249
He cultivated his land
for 20 years.

554
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:13,627
He raised two children
on that land.

555
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:17,631
He made something
out of that land,

556
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:20,092
and the Federation
told him

557
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:24,179
he had to give it all
up to the Cardassians.

558
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:27,433
Well, he just was not
willing to do that.

559
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:30,519
And it was people like him
who made both sides realize

560
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:33,855
that some accommodation had
to be made for the colonies

561
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,357
so they could stay.

562
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:37,443
The Cardassians
have no intention

563
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:40,779
of allowing these
people to stay.

564
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,115
They will either
force them out

565
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:45,242
or they will kill them.

566
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:49,037
It's already started.
Not a day goes by

567
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:52,666
when there's not some
random act of violence
against our people.

568
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,710
Every Federation
colonist knows

569
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,463
you do not go out
alone at night.

570
00:29:57,463 --> 00:30:00,006
Can you imagine living
under that kind of fear?

571
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:03,885
If you're saying
the Cardassian authorities
are not enforcing the laws...

572
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,555
Enforcing the laws?
The Cardassian authorities

573
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:09,349
were part of a mob that
stoned two colonists

574
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:12,519
on the streets
of Ropal City
three days ago.

575
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:16,607
That's something the Federation
can take up with the Cardassians
at the highest levels.

576
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:18,233
Well, that will help a lot.

577
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,988
The word is the
Cardassian High Command

578
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:26,450
is arming their colonists
to the teeth.

579
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,243
You really think they'd risk

580
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,287
sending weapons
into the Demilitarized Zone

581
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:31,705
and breaking the treaty?

582
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:34,040
I think they'll find
a way to do it

583
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,336
that's not so obvious.

584
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:41,507
Not long ago, we caught
the Cardassians shipping weapons

585
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:45,969
to Bajoran extremists through
a third party, the Yridians.

586
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:49,055
That sounds about right.

587
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:51,433
Would the<i> Bok'Nor</i> have
been transferring weapons

588
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:53,852
to someone else
to bring in here?

589
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,313
If it was,
then the transfer was made

590
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:58,565
before the ship
reached the station.

591
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:02,528
The cargo holds
of the<i> Bok'Nor</i> were empty.

592
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:04,655
Do you think he did it?

593
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:06,281
Samuels?

594
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:11,495
I don't know.

595
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:14,206
They could have forced him
to make a false confession

596
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,291
and then killed him.

597
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,794
I don't think Gul Dukat
would drag me all the way here

598
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:20,671
unless he knew
he could prove it.

599
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:22,964
Well, maybe he did do it, Ben.
I don't know.

600
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,466
(<i> sighs</i> )

601
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,887
Damn!

602
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,223
I've got to go see his wife.

603
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:35,352
I don't know
what I'm going to tell her.

604
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:43,360
It makes you pine for
the good old, dull days
in New Berlin, doesn't it?

605
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,487
Sausage and beer all around,

606
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:48,365
and everyone's idea
of a good time

607
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:50,576
was the mazurka festival.

608
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:54,496
Gretchen and Jennifer had a ball
there together, didn't they?

609
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:58,792
I'll never forget the sight
of you in those lederhosen.

610
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:01,961
I still have the hat.

611
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,051
Is there something larger
going on here, Cal?

612
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,263
<i>Are</i> these colonists

613
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:14,224
organizing some kind
of terrorist campaign?

614
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:18,562
Well, if they are,
they're not about
to tell me about it.

615
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:21,815
But I'll tell you
one thing, Ben.
Between you and me,

616
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:25,277
those people have every right
to defend themselves.

617
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:28,655
When the Federation
said good-bye to them,

618
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:31,366
they left them no other choice.

619
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:47,132
You're very quiet,
Commander.

620
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:50,636
You knew about Samuels
before we left.

621
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:53,555
I knew about
his confession, yes.

622
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:55,307
I didn't know he was...

623
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:59,728
I was as surprised
as you were by his death.

624
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:02,898
No one is going to buy
your suicide story.

625
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:07,068
I don't care what he did.

626
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:10,823
This kind of barbaric
disregard for life
will gut this treaty.

627
00:33:10,823 --> 00:33:14,117
If it means anything,
I entirely agree.

628
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,662
I told Evek
he was a fool

629
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:18,997
to let Samuels die.

630
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,875
A good interrogator doesn't
allow his subject to die.

631
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:23,627
You lose the advantage.

632
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:26,839
That's all you're interested in,
isn't it? The advantage.

633
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:29,508
Oh, now, don't go spouting off

634
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:34,638
your holier-than-thou
Federation fair play dogma.

635
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:37,223
And lest we forget

636
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:41,561
your man was responsible
for the deaths of
78 innocent crewmen.

637
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,605
What was the<i> Bok'Nor</i>
transporting?

638
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:45,607
The<i> Bok'Nor</i>
had just delivered

639
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:49,110
14 metric tons of golside ore
to the Regulon system

640
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,988
prior to its arrival
at the wormhole.

641
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:53,031
You're sure
it wasn't carrying weapons?

642
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,033
Weapons? To whom?

643
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,661
To the Cardassians
in the Demilitarized Zone.

644
00:33:57,661 --> 00:33:59,913
No, the route
of the<i> Bok'Nor</i>

645
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:02,624
didn't take it anywhere near
the Demilitarized Zone.

646
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:05,126
It could have rendezvoused
with someone else--

647
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:08,005
with the Lissepians, maybe.
They could have transferred
the weapons to them

648
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:09,923
and they could have taken
the weapons to...

649
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:12,634
Commander! I know
you'd love to find

650
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:15,345
some justification
for this mass murder

651
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:17,514
to ease
your Federation conscience,

652
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:22,728
but if the<i> Bok'Nor</i>
was carrying weapons,
I would know.

653
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:28,107
And on the lives of my children,
I swear to you it was not.

654
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:32,654
I didn't know you had children.

655
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:34,406
Seven.

656
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,595
I received your message.
How soon will it be available?

657
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:59,890
My source can have
everything ready tomorrow.
Say, by 1400 hours.

658
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:02,350
That's not soon enough.
I must leave
the station tonight.

659
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,812
You're leaving so soon?
My plans have changed.

660
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:08,273
Can your source
have the materials
ready by tonight?

661
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:10,108
I guess he'll have to.

662
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:13,403
I have your latinum,
if you'd like to count it.

663
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:15,321
Are you trustworthy?

664
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:17,074
I'm a Vulcan.

665
00:35:17,074 --> 00:35:19,034
Of course.
Just a little joke.

666
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:21,578
I'm sure it's all there.

667
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:24,790
Well, it wouldn't hurt
to give it a quick
count, I suppose.

668
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,542
I will have it brought
to your quarters.

669
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:31,129
I was looking forward
to showing you more ways

670
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,799
to mix business
with pleasure.

671
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:35,926
Perhaps in the future.

672
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:40,513
I do find you...
intriguing, Quark.

673
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,560
"Intriguing."

674
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:50,356
You can stay in the guest suite
on Level H-2

675
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,776
while you arrange transport
back to Cardassia.

676
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:54,778
I'll have a security guard
meet you there.

677
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:57,614
Starfleet security, if you
don't mind, Commander.

678
00:35:57,614 --> 00:36:00,075
Some of the Bajoran
deputies are still around

679
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:02,828
from the good old days
when I was in charge.
I understand.

680
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:04,871
If there's anything
else I can do

681
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,832
to assist you in
your investigation...

682
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:08,750
I think I can
handle it from here.

683
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,215
Chief?

684
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:18,176
O'BRIEN: Yes, sir.
I've got answers for you,

685
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,761
but I'm not sure
you're going to like them.

686
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:21,554
It<i> was</i>
an implosive device.

687
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:23,348
Yes, sir.
And not only that...

688
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:26,143
Not only that, it was a
Federation implosive device.

689
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:29,521
Yes, sir. The traces
of mercassium we found

690
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,606
were from the casing
of the device itself.

691
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,109
It had to be
a Federation design.

692
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:36,778
Get me Starfleet Command
on subspace.

693
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:50,583
Commander, is there anything
you'd like me to communicate

694
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,627
to the provisional
government?

695
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:54,796
Tell them some reckless colonist
in the Demilitarized Zone

696
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:57,256
blew up the<i> Bok'Nor.</i>
There's no further threat

697
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:59,551
of Cardassian reprisals
to Bajor.

698
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:02,054
I'll advise all of our outposts
to stand down.

699
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:08,518
Sir, are... are we facing
the prospect of war here?

700
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:11,396
Not if I can help it.
But that's what
the colonists are after.

701
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:13,690
I don't think
they know<i> what</i>
they're after, Major.

702
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,274
I just know
they have to be stopped,

703
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:17,194
and it's Starfleet's job
to stop them.

704
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:18,862
Sir, I know this is
none of my business...

705
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:20,488
But you're going to give
me your opinion anyway.

706
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,490
I don't know what
the Cardassians told you.

707
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,617
They played a confession
of the man who planted the bomb,

708
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,619
a man they most likely
tortured to death.

709
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,955
And you don't think you might
be playing into their hands?

710
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,499
I've got people out there
killing people, Major.

711
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,752
You suggest I turn
a blind eye to that?

712
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:36,129
They don't have a right
to defend themselves?
They've crossed the line!

713
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:38,215
If Starfleet is unwilling
to defend their people...

714
00:37:38,215 --> 00:37:40,133
They chose to live
with the Cardassians!

715
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:43,220
Well, I didn't!
But I lived with them
for 26 years

716
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:47,224
before the liberation came.
Every Bajoran lived with them
in constant fear.

717
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:49,851
I know what those colonists
are going through.

718
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:53,312
Most of all, I know
that the Cardassians
can't be trusted

719
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:56,066
to keep their side
of the bargain in this treaty.

720
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:59,318
So, you'd suggest the Federation
not keep our side
of the bargain either--

721
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:01,362
perhaps by arming
these colonists?

722
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:04,074
I can tell you
one thing for certain.

723
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:07,326
The Cardassians are the enemy,
not your own colonists,

724
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:09,746
and if Starfleet
can't understand that,

725
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:12,999
then the Federation
is even more naive
than I already think it is.

726
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:23,927
I've been sent to relieve you.

727
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:25,553
There must be
some mistake.

728
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,430
I just reported
for duty an hour...

729
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:35,188
(<i> door chimes</i> )
DUKAT: Yes?

730
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:37,398
Sorry to disturb you,
sir, but there's
a message here

731
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:39,067
from Commander Sisko.

732
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:44,030
We have been asked to escort you
to Airlock 11, sir.

733
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,740
A Cardassian freighter
has just arrived.

734
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,784
Is there a problem?

735
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:49,911
Apparently, another bomb
has been found and disarmed.

736
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:05,177
Where's Commander Sisko?

737
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:07,846
MAN:
Comfortably asleep
in his quarters, I hope.

738
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,934
Remember me?

739
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:15,937
I take it
we're not about to board

740
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:18,064
a Cardassian freighter.

741
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:44,299
(<i> intense,</i>
<i>indistinct conversation</i> )

742
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:46,759
BASHIR:
What do you think
they're telling him?

743
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:49,387
With two kidnappings
and a ship exploding
in the course of a week,

744
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,472
I'm sure they've got
a few things to say.

745
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:54,642
It's their own fault.
I've been warning them
since the beginning.

746
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:57,520
What are you
talking about--
<i>their</i> fault?

747
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,564
You're in charge
of security.

748
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:02,608
If you will let me be
in charge of security,

749
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:05,028
I will give you
a safe station.

750
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:07,613
You people tell
me to do my job,

751
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,241
then give me a
Federation rule book

752
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:11,409
listing all the
things I can't do.

753
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:15,038
Untie my hands before
you start to blame me,
Mr. O'Brien.

754
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:17,415
DAX:
I'm sure no one meant
to blame you, Odo.

755
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,292
Give me the right
to set a curfew.

756
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:21,669
Let me do more searches
of arriving passengers.

757
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,380
Give me 50
more deputies.

758
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,090
And this station will be
just the way it was

759
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:27,008
during the occupation.

760
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:29,886
Say what you like.
It was safer then.

761
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:33,348
Unless you happened
to be a Bajoran.

762
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:37,269
I want a complete review
of all security measures
on board this station.

763
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:38,853
I'll be delighted
to accommodate you.

764
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,897
What do we have from the guard?

765
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,441
KIRA: He's given us
a description of the two
who assaulted him--

766
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:46,485
A Vulcan female
and a human male in
a Starfleet officer's uniform.

767
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:49,239
We're trying to locate anyone
they might have contacted here.

768
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:51,324
How many ships left the station
during the night?

769
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:53,618
Only two, sir.
The Bardeezan
merchant ship

770
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,870
and a Galador freighter.
What were their destinations?

771
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,081
O'BRIEN:
The Bardeezans went
through the wormhole.

772
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:00,041
The freighter is operating
on a trade route

773
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:02,377
between Galador II
and Farius Prime.

774
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:04,212
I'm guessing these people

775
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:06,631
wouldn't take Dukat
through the wormhole.

776
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:08,925
They'd head back to
the Demilitarized Zone with him.

777
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:13,305
Dax, check the Galador
ship's registry and make sure
it's in order.

778
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:16,849
Chief, see if you can
identify its warp signature
from our sensor records.

779
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,602
No problem, Commander.
I've got it.

780
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,229
Last known course.

781
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:23,273
The computer's showing
it was on a bearing

782
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:26,067
216 mark 177.

783
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:29,404
As it left our sensor range,
it was still heading
for Farius Prime.

784
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:34,033
Major, send a message
to Farius Prime.

785
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:37,829
If that ship shows up,
and I doubt that it will,
I want to know it right away.

786
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:39,831
I could send the warp signature
out over subspace.

787
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,833
You could make it a
general transmission.

788
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,876
If it changes course,
someone should spot it.

789
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,628
Do it.

790
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,422
DAX: It's a phony.
The Galadorans

791
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:49,507
don't have any ships
in this sector.

792
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,009
The registry is forged.

793
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:53,594
Doctor, Major, you're with me.

794
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:56,764
Odo, send a message to Commander
Hudson at the Volon colony

795
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,641
that I'm moving in his direction
on the assumption

796
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,852
that Dukat will be taken
to the Demilitarized Zone.

797
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:03,771
Give him the warp
signature of the ship.
O'BRIEN: Aye, sir.

798
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,774
Commander, we just
received a general
subspace transmission

799
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,734
from somewhere in the
Demilitarized Zone.

800
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,236
A group there
is taking credit

801
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:11,779
for the kidnapping
of Dukat.

802
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,739
They're calling
themselves...

803
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:15,574
"the Maquis."

804
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:32,800
O'BRIEN:
Commander, a
Klingon freighter

805
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,802
two light-years from
the Demilitarized Zone

806
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,929
has ID'd the warp signature.

807
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:39,265
The ship<i> did</i> change course,
just as you predicted.

808
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:42,560
Transmit their
last known coordinates
and heading to us, Chief.

809
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,937
(<i> console beeping</i> )
Acknowledged.

810
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:47,273
Let us know if anyone else
picks up their signature.

811
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,401
Aye, sir. O'Brien out.

812
00:42:49,401 --> 00:42:51,819
Set a new course, Major.
Yes, sir.

813
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:56,866
Their heading takes them
into the badlands.
Badlands?

814
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:59,494
It's a stretch of
the Cardassian border
ships try to avoid.

815
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:01,620
A lot of plasma
storms in the area.

816
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:05,166
A few ships have been lost there
in the past year or two.

817
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:08,545
Sounds like the perfect place
for a hideout.

818
00:43:08,545 --> 00:43:10,422
Excuse me, sir.

819
00:43:10,422 --> 00:43:13,341
What do you plan to do
if we catch up with them?

820
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:16,594
After all, these Maquis
<i>are</i> Federation colonists.

821
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:19,722
We're going
to get Gul Dukat back
by any means necessary.

822
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,725
Even if we have to fire
on our own people?

823
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:25,103
(<i> console beeping</i> )

824
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:28,773
Long-range sensors
are picking up
the warp signature.

825
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:31,234
It leads to an
M-Class asteroid.

826
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:32,610
Take us there.

827
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,497
Scanning
the surface.

828
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:46,332
I've located
the ship.

829
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:47,833
Those are
human life signs.

830
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:49,335
Is there a Cardassian
among them?

831
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:50,503
No, sir.

832
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:52,380
Prepare to beam down.

833
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:18,615
HUDSON:
I'm glad to see you had
no trouble finding us, Ben.

834
00:44:18,615 --> 00:44:22,535
It seems that one disaster
after another

835
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:25,121
keeps bringing us
back together again.
