00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:08,884
(<i> chuckling</i> )

2
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:11,971
When my husband was alive,
we ran the business together

3
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:13,764
and I managed to put away

4
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:17,351
a bit of latinum
every year just for myself.

5
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,937
Now he's gone, well...

6
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:23,357
I've got quite a little sum.

7
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,024
That's important.

8
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:27,444
Well, to be honest,
it's not enough--

9
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,112
not for the future--

10
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:32,449
not for the way I want
to live out my retirement.

11
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:35,118
So, I've decided
to invest it all in...

12
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:38,121
I can't believe
I'm telling you this.

13
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:40,582
I just met you.

14
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:43,084
But I feel like
I can really trust you.

15
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,462
It's like I've
known you forever.

16
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,715
When hearts
are in sympathy

17
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:49,842
time collapses.

18
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:51,844
I'm taking
everything I saved

19
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:54,346
and I'm purchasing
the mining concession

20
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:56,765
on the entire
Vlugtan asteroid belt.

21
00:00:56,765 --> 00:01:00,060
How ambitious, and such
an adventurous undertaking

22
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,604
for a woman of
your delicate
sensibilities.

23
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,523
But are you sure that's wise?

24
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:06,316
Prospecting can be risky.

25
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,902
Not this time.

26
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:10,654
My father was
a stellar cartographer.

27
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:11,906
30 years ago

28
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:13,657
he conducted
a full spectrum

29
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:15,826
mineral analysis
of those asteroids

30
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:19,538
but he never had the means
to follow up on what he found.

31
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:23,250
And now you plan to carry
out your father's dream.

32
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,794
When his survey results
become public

33
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:29,631
I'll get seven times
my investment back-- overnight.

34
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:34,511
I still can't believe
I'm telling you this.

35
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,722
My secret plan.

36
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:38,640
I've been thinking
about it for years.

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,809
I never even told my husband.

38
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:43,604
It must be all
this Gamzian wine.

39
00:01:46,065 --> 00:01:48,275
How brave you are

40
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:50,778
to do all of this on your own.

41
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:52,487
(<i> sighing</i> ):
It hasn't been easy.

42
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,865
There's so much
to keep track of

43
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:57,367
so much to do.

44
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,870
Maybe I could help.

45
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,706
(<i> sighs</i> )

46
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:07,419
Would you consider some
kind of partnership?

47
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:09,170
Let's go.

48
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,465
Exactly where are we going?

49
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:12,800
To Security.

50
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,301
But I've done
nothing wrong.

51
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,261
It's true.
We were just talking.

52
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,596
<i>You</i> were talking, Madam.

53
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:19,431
<i>He</i> was listening.

54
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,186
Security Chief Odo,
isn't it?

55
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:27,898
I've been watching you
ever since you arrived.

56
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,691
Should I be flattered?

57
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,736
Martus Mazur, a refugee
from the El-Aurian system.

58
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:35,322
Well, everyone has to be
from somewhere.

59
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,532
Where are you from, Odo?

60
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,910
Don't pull that
routine on me.

61
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,244
What routine?

62
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,163
I know all about
you El-Aurians.

63
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,166
You're listeners.
People like to
talk to you.

64
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,961
Everyone has to have
someone to confide in--

65
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:51,212
someone to hear
their stories.

66
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,881
I offer a sympathetic ear

67
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,342
and if they request my help,
I give it to them.

68
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,052
That couple from
Pythro V told me

69
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:59,138
you asked for their
financial access codes.

70
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:01,222
Some might call helping
an elderly couple

71
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,350
invest their savings
a compassionate act.

72
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,353
<i>Not</i> when you invest it
in your own business--

73
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,522
a business that
promptly folds.

74
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,858
I had a run of bad luck.

75
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:12,860
No one regrets it
more than I do.

76
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,444
You're a con man.

77
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,446
And they've signed
a complaint.

78
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,741
This isn't necessary.

79
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,243
It really
<i>isn't</i> necessary.

80
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,663
I'm not going anywhere.

81
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,331
Let's have a drink.

82
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,167
Talk a bit?

83
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,004
(<i> sighs</i> )

84
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,762
Chief.

85
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,430
Hello, Doctor.

86
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,807
Great job.

87
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:50,809
You built it yourself,
didn't you?

88
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,435
Yeah, just finished.

89
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,979
I missed playing

90
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:56,898
and I figured
there would be at least

91
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,234
a couple of other players
on board.

92
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,569
Didn't think
you'd be one of them.

93
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,946
Captain of
the team

94
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,823
at Starfleet Medical Academy.

95
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,616
We took the Sector Championships
in my final year.

96
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,327
Against other medical students?

97
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:09,786
Against everybody.

98
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,454
Played a Vulcan
in the finals.

99
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,165
Talk about stamina.

100
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:15,209
Didn't think he ever actually
broke a sweat.

101
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:16,668
And you won?

102
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,503
Took him
on a back wall riser shot.

103
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,174
Oh, well, I can't say

104
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:26,094
I've had much in the way
of formal training myself

105
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,305
but it's been a serious pastime

106
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:30,098
for a lot of years.

107
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,391
Oh, some of the toughest players
I've come up against

108
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,228
didn't really know
what they were doing.

109
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:35,354
Really?

110
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:37,522
Ah... formally, I mean.

111
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,650
Hey, whatever works, works.

112
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,443
This exercise, for example

113
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:44,612
I picked up at a tournament
from a top player.

114
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,614
It's a 5,000-year-old
battle warm-up.

115
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,826
According to
the legend

116
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,661
it makes the heart
a friend to the hand.

117
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,378
Medically, I don't really know
what that means

118
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:01,462
but, uh, it seems to give me
a lot of energy.

119
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,631
Fancy a game?

120
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,508
Serve.

121
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:08,262
I guess by the lines,
you prefer the old-style rules?

122
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:13,725
I can play
any style you like.

123
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,394
Traditional it is, then.

124
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:17,229
Always been my
personal favorite.

125
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:18,730
Serve.

126
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:29,157
One.

127
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:37,040
(<i> loud, raspy snoring</i> )

128
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,712
Pardon me, friend.

129
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,301
(<i> snoring</i> )

130
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:49,761
Pardon<i> me.</i>

131
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,679

132
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,777

(<i> gasping groan</i> )

135
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:29,343
Friend...

136
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:32,095
friend, are you all right?

137
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,805
(<i> hacking gurgle</i> )

138
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,350
I thought you died.

139
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,353
If only I could be
so fortunate.

140
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:41,355
You were snoring.

141
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:43,648
Please accept
my apologies.

142
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,151
I didn't mean
to disturb you.

143
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:50,905
But, as you can see,
my health is not so good.

144
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:54,326
Yes. Well, I'm sorry
I had to wake you.

145
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:57,245
I wasn't always like this.

146
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,538
Of course not.

147
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,081
I had youth

148
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,792
vigor, fame...

149
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:06,587
wealth beyond measure.

150
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:09,341
All gone.

151
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:13,387
I'm not listening.

152
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:18,225
All because of this.

153
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,935
(<i> electronic beeping</i>
<i>and whirring</i> )

154
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,941
A gambling device?

155
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:33,823
Did you win?

156
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,076
Of course not.

157
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:39,620
You gambled away
everything you had?

158
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,622
In a manner of speaking.

159
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:46,169
Every trade deal I struck
was a disaster.

160
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,296
Every alliance I formed
fell apart.

161
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:52,967
Every endeavor backed,
a failure.

162
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,345
Well, what does this
have to do with a toy?

163
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:58,473
Sounds like you just had
a lot of rotten luck.

164
00:09:58,473 --> 00:09:59,433
Yes...

165
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,351
rotten luck.

166
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:08,149
In the end,
it all comes down to luck.

167
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:11,528
(<i> electronic beeping</i>
<i>and whirring</i> )

168
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,157
I won!

169
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,284
That's nice.

170
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:18,868
What did you win?

171
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,703
(<i> sighs deeply</i> )

172
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,686
Officer...

173
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:48,731
you've got a dead
prisoner in here.

174
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,276
Officer!

175
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,034
How'd it go?

176
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:06,249
(<i> panting</i> )

177
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,004
Good workout?

178
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,671
Medical school...

179
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,882
Captain of the team
at medical school.

180
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,926
Who are you talking about?

181
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,553
Bashir.

182
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:19,887
You had a game?

183
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,722
No,<i> he</i> had a game.

184
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,891
I just kind of stumbled around
the court for 90 minutes

185
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,393
and made
a complete ass of myself.

186
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,604
I'm sure
he didn't see it that way.

187
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,730
The hell he didn't--

188
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,442
that smug look on his face.

189
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:36,321
"I guess you prefer
old-style rules."

190
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,448
Like I was some kind of fossil.

191
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:41,075
In my day, I could have wiped
the court with him.

192
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,203
That's a point.
You're not a kid anymore.

193
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:46,373
It's nothing to
be ashamed of.

194
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,291
People just naturally slow down.

195
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,585
Oh, like molasses
in winter, huh?

196
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,212
Thanks.

197
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,839
Miles, you're taking this
way too seriously.

198
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,592
I'm out of shape, that's all.

199
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,969
I just need to get me wind back.

200
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,971
Sector champion, my eye.

201
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,475
He's vulnerable
to every one of my best shots.

202
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:11,898
I just...
I just couldn't get them there.

203
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,692
This time.

204
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,533
I thought he was going
to have a heart attack.

205
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,577
Come on, Julian,
it couldn't have been that bad.

206
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,036
No, really, his
face was flushed.

207
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,663
I could have
taken his pulse

208
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,540
just watching the
side of his neck.

209
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,832
Then why didn't you stop it?

210
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,501
Well, don't think
I didn't try.

211
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,086
After the first game,
I told him I had

212
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,295
an appointment--
he ignored me.

213
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,630
After the second game

214
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,755
I told him I was
getting tired.

215
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:38,717
He didn't believe me.

216
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:41,302
And then his racket broke,
and I thought, "Finally..."

217
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,137
But no, he made
me stay there

218
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,390
while he went away and
replicated another one.

219
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,683
So, what finally happened?

220
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,437
While he was gone

221
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,355
I called my assistant
and told her...

222
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,065
May I?

223
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:55,942
...told her to call me back
after five minutes

224
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,944
and say there was an
emergency at the Infirmary.

225
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,320
Oh, that's terrible.

226
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,072
There was no
other way out.

227
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:02,616
Otherwise, there
<i>would</i> have been

228
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:04,284
an emergency-- Chief
O'Brien's coronary.

229
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,620
Well, at least
it's all over.

230
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,912
That's just it.

231
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,623
This is just the beginning.

232
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,458
The Chief wants a rematch

233
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:14,377
and I'm telling you,
it's going to kill him.

234
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,254
Honestly, Julian,
you're exaggerating.

235
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:18,339
O'Brien can't be a day over 38.

236
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,717
That's too young to die.

237
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:26,556
I guess I'm overstating
the health risk.

238
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,725
That's not the point.

239
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,310
The Chief has
a lot of pride

240
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,978
and for good reason.

241
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,647
I really respect him--
the things he does

242
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:34,939
the kind of man he is.

243
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:40,361
I just... I just don't
want to humiliate him.

244
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,038
Another winner.

245
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,624
What luck.

246
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:54,000
The Pythron couple

247
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,918
has refused to
press charges.

248
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,545
You can go.

249
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:58,546
Of course.

250
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,632
Didn't I tell you?

251
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:03,426
They're my friends.

252
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:06,053
(<i> groans</i> )

253
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,388
All right.

254
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,182
Double or nothing.

255
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,351
House always
takes blue.

256
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,394
Sorry,
the drink's on you.

257
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,729
Can I help you?

258
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,314
Prosecco.

259
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:20,610
And how do you plan
on paying for this?

260
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,944
With charm, perhaps?

261
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,571
Double or nothing.

262
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,573
Double nothing
is still nothing.

263
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,826
If I lose, I'll
give you this.

264
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:30,662
House always takes blue.

265
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,083
Lucky.

266
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,585
My luck's running
good today.

267
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,086
So I've heard.

268
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,047
Decided not to testify,
did they?

269
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,256
I don't know
what you mean.

270
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,717
No?

271
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,802
The 47th Rule
of Acquisition says

272
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:48,847
"Don't trust a man wearing
a better suit than your own."

273
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:51,474
Either you're a con artist

274
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,727
or you're covering up
an empty coin purse.

275
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,812
I happen to know
it's both.

276
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:58,815
Well, we can't be all
as successful as you are.

277
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,317
(<i> laughing</i> )

278
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,027
Too true.

279
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,864
(<i> electronic beeping</i>
<i>and whirring</i> )

280
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,495
Some kind of game?

281
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:13,996
I've never seen
that one before.

282
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,081
How do you play?

283
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,999
Just press the key.

284
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:26,217
(<i> electronic beeping</i>
<i>and whirring fades down</i> )

285
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,094
Too bad.

286
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:36,603
(<i> beeping reaches crescendo</i> )

287
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:39,814
As I told you,
my luck's running good today.

288
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,816
Am I supposed to be impressed?

289
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,984
A little tinkering

290
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,613
some replication
and expansion...

291
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,865
It might make
a nice addition to your casino.

292
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,533
And who would play this?

293
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:54,537
It's just a child's toy.

294
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,623
My nephew, um...

295
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,792
it might keep him
out of my ears

296
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,084
for a couple of days.

297
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,253
I'll take it.

298
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,464
That's a tidy sum.

299
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,508
I'm feeling benevolent today.

300
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,927
Have another.

301
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:18,018
I might have accepted,
but the offer of the drink--

302
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:21,147
that tells me
you're very interested.

303
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,900
Nonsense.
You read too much into nothing.

304
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,653
My benevolence
is known far and wide.

305
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,530
Oh, it's legendary, I'm sure.

306
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,911
I'll take 100 times
what you've got here.

307
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:37,872
Not in this space-time
continuum, you won't.

308
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,791
Go try to peddle
this little triviality

309
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,417
down on Bajor.

310
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,838
You might be able
to trade it for a meal

311
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:48,174
but it won't be a hot one.

312
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:51,177
You'll be in profit
by the end of the week.

313
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,558
Final offer.

314
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,936
Take it before
my generosity fades.

315
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:05,441
(<i> electronic beeping</i>
<i>and whirring crescendos</i> )

316
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:12,532
Perhaps I'll hold onto it
a bit longer.

317
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,534
Suit yourself.

318
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:17,077
But be under no illusion--

319
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:20,164
if I was serious about
acquiring this, it would be mine

320
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,499
and for
substantially less

321
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:22,917
than what
you had hoped for.

322
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,544
It seems that overconfidence

323
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,546
comes in small packages
around here.

324
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:29,382
My track record
speaks for itself

325
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,551
just like your security file.

326
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:37,390
Thanks for the drink.

327
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,294
Times are difficult.

328
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,629
Oh, it's not that.

329
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:09,923
Business was good.

330
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,716
Then why are you
shutting down?

331
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:14,677
My husband and I ran
this place for nine years.

332
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:18,681
Before that, we had
a shop on Bajor for 17.

333
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:21,935
But a few months ago,
he passed away

334
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:25,772
and my heart's
just not in it anymore.

335
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,815
Not the same, is it?

336
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,401
Working by yourself?

337
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,194
No.

338
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:35,907
It's so much nicer
working next to someone else.

339
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,169
You understand.

340
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,845
Nice shot.

341
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,028
Damn!

342
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:20,534
You think I'm<i> stupid,</i> too, hmm?

343
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:23,121
I... don't know what
you're talking about.

344
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:25,123
I don't need
your charity.

345
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:26,958
Next time, you either
play your best game

346
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,584
or you don't play.

347
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:37,844
He can't do this.

348
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:39,345
I have an
exclusive contract.

349
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,554
I want him arrested.

350
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,056
Who are you
talking about?

351
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:43,641
Martus, that listener.

352
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,143
What's he done?

353
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:46,519
Just look.

354
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,521
Welcome, friends.

355
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,482
Welcome, welcome.

356
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:55,194
Welcome to Club Martus.

357
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,376
I<i> have</i> a contract

358
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,336
for which I paid
considerably.

359
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,213
All gambling at DS9

360
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,298
happens at Quark's,
or it doesn't happen.

361
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,633
A few bribes to
the Cardassians

362
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,885
when they ran this place

363
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:20,344
doesn't constitute
a contract.

364
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,679
Not in the eyes
of the Federation.

365
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,430
He's a con artist, a crook.

366
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,766
One more won't make
much difference.

367
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,434
Need I remind you
that without me

368
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,228
the other merchants
would have abandoned

369
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,147
this station after
the occupation.

370
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,439
You owe me!

371
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,816
You begged me
to stay here

372
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:35,651
when you first
came on board

373
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,278
and I did, against
my better judgment.

374
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,073
I didn't beg.
I blackmailed you.

375
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:42,116
And don't pretend
it hasn't paid off
for you either.

376
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,618
It's paid off
fine until now.

377
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,871
Martus is cutting
into my profits.

378
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:49,373
I want him stopped,
before it gets any worse.

379
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,918
Too late for
that, my brother.

380
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,419
What's the meaning of this?

381
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:56,172
I've promised
your underpaid sibling

382
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:59,508
a one-quarter partnership
in my establishment.

383
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,594
Make me a better offer.

384
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:04,180
A... a bidding war, over you?

385
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,224
Ha, don't make me laugh.

386
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:07,934
(<i> nervous laughter</i> )

387
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,518
Careful, Martus.

388
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,687
He shaves
the latinum.

389
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,313
I do not.

390
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,648
Not much.

391
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:24,324
(<i> laughter and conversation</i> )

392
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:33,584
Martus?

393
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:35,253
I've just received word

394
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:37,379
the Vlugtan government
has accepted my bid.

395
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,090
Well, that's wonderful.

396
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,800
(<i> sighs</i> )

397
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,342
What's wrong?

398
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,470
They won't finalize
the transaction

399
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:49,100
until I commission a study on
the effects of asteroid mining

400
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,726
on inner-system
navigation.

401
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,812
All my money is
committed to the bid.

402
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,981
I can't afford the study

403
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:58,151
and I only have
a week to get it done.

404
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,819
How much do you need?

405
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:02,613
10,000 isiks.

406
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:04,323
10,000 isiks?

407
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,034
It won't be easy to raise
that kind of money.

408
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,577
I know, I know.

409
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,663
I hope I can find
an investor in time.

410
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,498
I might know someone.

411
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,667
But what kind of return

412
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:17,586
can they expect
on their investment?

413
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:23,383
Well, once I began mining,
I'd pay back ten times 10,000.

414
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,385
Don't worry, Alsia.

415
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:28,597
I'll do everything in my power
to keep your dream alive.

416
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,850
Oh, Martus.

417
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,436
I don't know
how to thank you.

418
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,438
Is there
some problem, Rom?

419
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,815
Not with this batch

420
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:39,650
but with my
brother around

421
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,568
you can never be
too careful.

422
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,487
You mean to say
he'd poison the canapés?

423
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,822
Maybe not poison

424
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,782
but a small
intestinal bug?

425
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,701
I wouldn't put
it past him.

426
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,494
Oh, don't worry
about Quark.

427
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:53,789
I've had the most astonishing
run of luck lately.

428
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,958
I'm beginning to think
I can do no wrong.

429
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:01,505
Neatness counts.

430
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,007
Never think
it doesn't.

431
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:09,555
A toast...

432
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,682
to the Queen of
the Promenade.

433
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:15,186
A woman whose business
acumen is matched

434
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:17,604
only by her beauty and charm.

435
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,565
Have I missed anything?

436
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,067
To you...

437
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:23,277
my treasure.

438
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:27,531
Are you as
pleased as I am?

439
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,991
What do you think?

440
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:31,952
I think we make
quite a good team.

441
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:34,247
Perhaps we should consider

442
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:36,540
formalizing
our relationship.

443
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:40,460
Are you proposing to me?

444
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,339
What do you think?

445
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:46,424
Oh, it's beautiful.

446
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:48,969
You deserve nothing less.

447
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,764
(<i> electronic beeping</i>
<i>and whirring</i> )

448
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:53,599
And these are wonderful.

449
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,517
Where did you find them?

450
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,103
I had them replicated

451
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,313
from a hand-held version
a friend gave me.

452
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:01,357
I've never seen
anything like them.

453
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:02,983
No one has.

454
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,526
All right. Is
this everything

455
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,986
you'll need for the lab?

456
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,529
I think so.

457
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,115
(<i> console beeping</i> )

458
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:10,490
I don't believe it.

459
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,450
Believe what?

460
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,870
I've had the computer looking
for this program for weeks.

461
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,580
It was buried somewhere
in the deep code level

462
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,456
right before
the Cardassians left.

463
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:20,126
Huh. How did
you find it?

464
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:21,877
I'm not sure.
It's more like it found<i> me.</i>

465
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,587
Just lucky, I guess.

466
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:27,216
I am so sorry.

467
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:28,592
What happened?

468
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,386
Well, you served.
I returned low.

469
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,845
You slipped on the ball.

470
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,180
I slipped on a ball?

471
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,556
Stepped right on it,
mid-flight.

472
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,766
Never seen anything
like it.

473
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,143
(<i> scoffs</i> )

474
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:38,560
Easy now,
let me check you out.

475
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,478
I'm fine. Serve.

476
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:42,564
<i>MAN:</i>
<i>Dr. Bashir,</i>
<i>report to the Infirmary.</i>

477
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:45,525
I'm sorry, Chief.
I have to go.

478
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,569
I'll get you
next time, okay?

479
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:48,988
Look, about that...

480
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:50,614
It's just that...
I guess I don't enjoy

481
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,241
this game
as much as I used to.

482
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:53,867
I hope you don't mind.

483
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,661
I'm sure you'll find
another opponent.

484
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,433
Where is everybody?

485
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:20,811
My friendly
competitor's place.

486
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:22,646
A listener.

487
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,773
So what?

488
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,400
So he listens.

489
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,943
I can listen.

490
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,736
I can listen
as well as anyone.

491
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,197
What happened?

492
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:33,573
I fell down.

493
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:34,825
See? I'm listening.

494
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:35,993
Nothing to it.

495
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:37,619
How did you fall down?

496
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,664
Playing racquetball
with Bashir.

497
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,458
Where?

498
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,584
At the court.
Where do you think?

499
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:45,961
What was the score?

500
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,046
Who cares?

501
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,588
I care. I'm listening.

502
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:50,383
Tell me your problems.
All of them.

503
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:52,676
I've got no problems
a good drop shot wouldn't cure.

504
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:53,969
He beat you.

505
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,180
Only by half a step,
that's all.

506
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,015
He's got a few years
on me, so what?

507
00:25:58,015 --> 00:25:59,641
I've got
more experience.

508
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,101
The aging champion...

509
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,312
I've got spin shots
he's never seen.

510
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:04,938
...versus the
daring challenger.

511
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,648
So I had a few bad breaks, huh?

512
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,275
One more game,
that's all I needed.

513
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,860
Come one, come all...

514
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,611
I could have kicked him
all over the court

515
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:12,654
and he knows it, too.

516
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:13,989
Welcome to Quark's.

517
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,824
Thanks.

518
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,701
Don't mention it.

519
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:20,496
Quark's House of Champions.

520
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,499
Damn!

521
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:24,833
Something wrong, Major?

522
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:25,918
My terminal just
self-destructed.

523
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,253
What?

524
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:28,754
I lost an
evaluation report

525
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,130
I've been working
on for weeks.

526
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,215
Even the backups?

527
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:32,966
Even the backups.

528
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:35,052
Funny. I've been hearing
a lot of bad luck stories

529
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:36,220
in the last few hours.

530
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,888
Doctor Bashir tells me

531
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:39,265
the Infirmary is full
of minor accidents.

532
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:40,640
People slipping and falling

533
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,268
walking through
turbolift doors

534
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:43,519
before they open--
that kind of thing.

535
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,145
Well, I've had
a great day

536
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,356
so don't try sending
your misfortunes my way.

537
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:48,982
Come on, you make
your own luck.

538
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:51,318
We all know that.

539
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,487
(<i> crash, groan</i> )

540
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:58,409
(<i> excited yelling</i> )

541
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:06,041
They all hit the
jackpot at once?

542
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:09,128
Is there any way I
can blame this on you?

543
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:10,963
I don't think so.

544
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,465
No, I suppose not.

545
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:16,093
All right.
Pay them all off.

546
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:19,138
Challenge of the Galaxy.

547
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:23,183
Match of the Century.

548
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:28,147
Wonder of the Wormhole.

549
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:35,321
House always takes blue.

550
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:43,703
If it's action you want,
you've come to the right place.

551
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:46,499
Excitement?
We've got it all.

552
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:50,294
Thrills and spills.
Victory and defeat.

553
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:53,380
Look no further,
we've got it all.

554
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,924
And here he is--
the reigning champion

555
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,635
of Starfleet--

556
00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:59,677
a legend on both sides
of the wormhole.

557
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:01,514
Ladies and gentlemen

558
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:04,391
Miles "The Mechanic" O'Brien.

559
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,106
What's this all about?

560
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,941
I got an emergency call.

561
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,485
Well, so did I

562
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:15,861
but I don't see
any emergency.

563
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,695
And the challenger.

564
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:21,867
He's fast, he's deadly,
he's Julian Bashir.

565
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:24,702
They call him
"The Doctor."

566
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:27,873
The grudge match
of the galaxy.

567
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:30,083
Get down here.

568
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,545
And all for a worthy cause.

569
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:35,839
Yes, these noble competitors
have insisted

570
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,884
that I donate half
the house's winnings

571
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:41,637
to the Bajoran Fund
for Orphans.

572
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:43,263
Orphans?

573
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,015
(<i> appreciative murmuring</i> )

574
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:47,934
QUARK:
The Mechanic
versus The Doctor.

575
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,895
Tomorrow, 1200 hours.

576
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:54,525
Only one will emerge victorious,
so place your bets

577
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:58,654
and in the meantime,
the tables are open.

578
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:01,365
This is outrageous.

579
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:03,450
We haven't agreed
to anything.

580
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,160
As your exclusive promoter

581
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,912
I have the right
to arrange matches as I see fit.

582
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:08,121
Exclusive promoter?

583
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,456
Just sign here.

584
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,790
Forget it, Quark.

585
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,586
I understand
how you feel

586
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:17,089
but... think
of the children.

587
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:19,925
The monks have already
made a down payment

588
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:21,843
on new blankets
for the winter.

589
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:24,930
(<i> sighing</i> ):
Ah, well, I'm sure
the little ones

590
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,725
can huddle together
for warmth.

591
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:34,273
Looks like you're going to get
that rematch after all.

592
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,010
I don't believe it.

593
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,929
The program I found--
it disappeared.

594
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,514
Have you checked
the deep code level?

595
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,349
No luck.

596
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,184
It's funny.

597
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,729
It's like the computer brought
that program up at random

598
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:16,189
and then just swallowed
it up again.

599
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,066
SISKO:
Major,
you're all right.

600
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:20,068
Not even a sprain,
which is more than I can say

601
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,820
for everybody else
in the Infirmary.

602
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,697
Still crowded?

603
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:25,907
Yeah, and Doctor Bashir tells me
it's a whole<i> new</i> batch.

604
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,243
More minor accidents?
Dozens of them.

605
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,412
Could there be a connection
between the accidents

606
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:32,247
and the increase
in the system failures?

607
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:36,042
I didn't get hurt
by a system failure.
I tripped and fell.

608
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,086
Just coincidence,
that's all.

609
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:42,841
There must be a logical
explanation for all this.

610
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,761
Maybe a virus or some kind
of spatial disruption.

611
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:47,387
It would have
to be something

612
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:50,432
that would affect
both people and machinery.
Get on it.

613
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,523
I always had smaller lobes
than the rest of the boys.

614
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:59,232
They used to
tease me about it.

615
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,567
Quark was the worst.

616
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,361
He told everyone
I was adopted.

617
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:04,946
I just don't understand.
Things were going so well.

618
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,073
On my Naming Day,
Quark substituted

619
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:09,242
old vegetables
for my presents.

620
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,786
Then he sold
the presents

621
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,579
for more than our
father had paid...

622
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:16,208
I couldn't care less
about your trivial childhood!

623
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:22,130
We've been
virtually abandoned

624
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,257
and I want to know why.

625
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,802
A bad streak--
it happens.

626
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,928
Not to me, it doesn't.

627
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,556
I require the comfort

628
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:32,432
of a compassionate soul.

629
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:36,645
(<i> sighs</i> )

630
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:39,064
Don't think I didn't see
through you

631
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:41,400
right from
the start.

632
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,526
(<i> nervous laughter</i> )

633
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:44,403
It's a joke.
Really.

634
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:46,279
Well, in case

635
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:49,157
you've forgotten, I still
hold the lease on this place.

636
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,951
I want you out of here
by tomorrow

637
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:54,663
and take those damn things
with you.

638
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:57,416
But... but...
but...

639
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,377
But, treasure.

640
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:03,088
Oh, I knew no good
would come of this.

641
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,715
I never should
have left Quark.

642
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:06,299
What's going
to happen now?

643
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,718
I'm not sure.

644
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:12,556
But I have an idea.

645
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:26,820
The profits from the club.

646
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:30,616
I believe it comes
to just about 10,000 isiks.

647
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:34,994
Oh, Martus, you don't know
what this means to me.

648
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:37,122
I know what
it means to me--

649
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:38,832
ten times as much
in return.

650
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:40,292
You won't regret this.

651
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:44,087
You'll see.
We'll both be rich.

652
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:53,012
(<i> beeping fades down</i> )

653
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,985
You can beat his backhand.

654
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,570
Keep the ball low

655
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,238
and to his left.

656
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:15,243
Corner return
on the serve.

657
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:21,207
Then kill shot left.

658
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:24,210
If he returns again

659
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,756
high back wall.

660
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:29,215
And remember...

661
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:33,261
Win or lose,
tonight we celebrate.

662
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,311
Miles, wait.

663
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:48,401
A silk handkerchief

664
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:52,906
medieval Japanese design...

665
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:55,241
scented with my perfume.

666
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:03,124
Kick his butt.

667
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:14,177
Doctor, I brought
you something.

668
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,304
A token of thanks
from the monks

669
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:17,723
to show you how much

670
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:19,098
they appreciate
your participation

671
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:20,517
in their little
fund-raiser.

672
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:21,935
Oh, thanks.
Put it over there.

673
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:25,355
Um, aren't you going
to try some?

674
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:26,857
What is it?

675
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:29,484
The monks tell me
it's a medicinal brew--

676
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,778
an ancient secret
of their order.

677
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:34,823
It's supposed to impart
great energy and vigor.

678
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:36,909
Just the kind
of thing to have

679
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:39,285
before an athletic
competition.

680
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:43,832
But... you're
a man of science.

681
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:46,793
You probably don't believe
in folk medicine.

682
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,253
Actually, you'd
be surprised

683
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:49,963
just how often
traditional medicine

684
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:52,007
turns out to have
genuine value.

685
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,508
Did they say
what was in this stuff?

686
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,134
They didn't exactly

687
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:57,554
but I'm sure it's all
completely natural.

688
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,848
Oh, the monks said
you should drink
the whole thing

689
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:02,059
in one gulp in order to
get the proper effect.

690
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:04,019
Did they?

691
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:09,900
What are you doing?

692
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,944
Just curious
about its contents.

693
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:14,237
Uh... what about
your exercises?

694
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,655
This won't take a second.

695
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:16,782
Oh, why bother?

696
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:18,241
Don't you trust the monks?

697
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,704
Ah, water, sucrose,
dextrose

698
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:24,456
tribnel root extract

699
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:28,001
grain particulates,
yeast, synthehol...

700
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:30,128
and 17 milligrams

701
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:34,800
of hyvroxilated
quint-ethyl metacetamine.

702
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,802
Like I said,
all natural.

703
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:38,929
It's an anesthetic, Quark.

704
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:41,014
If I drank that,
I'd hardly be able to stand

705
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:42,641
let alone play
racquetball.

706
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,017
You were trying to fix
the match, weren't you?

707
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:45,852
Would I do that?

708
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:48,229
If you had enough latinum bet
on Chief O'Brien, you would.

709
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,899
No one's betting
on Chief O'Brien.

710
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:52,525
All the money's on you.

711
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:54,027
If you win, there
won't be any profits.

712
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:56,863
And if there
aren't any profits

713
00:35:56,863 --> 00:36:00,408
I can't donate
anything to the monks.

714
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:05,664
No donations,
no winter blankets
for the children.

715
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:10,335
But... if you lose

716
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,045
then the house would win

717
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:15,090
and the monks would
get their blankets.

718
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:18,093
Are you suggesting
that I throw the match?

719
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:21,346
For the children.

720
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:22,430
Forget it, Quark.

721
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,057
But the blankets...

722
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:25,642
Will be provided by you
one way or another.

723
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:27,686
And if the monks don't get
their blankets

724
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,938
Chief O'Brien and I
will be very upset.

725
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:31,690
Do I make myself clear?

726
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,608
Perfectly.

727
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:37,946
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a match to play.

728
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:48,040
Kira said you've
found something.

729
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,457
Oh, I found
something, all right.

730
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,043
I just don't know
what it means.

731
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:52,127
Look at this.

732
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:53,252
Solar neutrinos.

733
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,587
Notice anything unusual?

734
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,089
KIRA:
There are a lot
of them?

735
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:58,008
The spin.

736
00:36:58,008 --> 00:37:00,593
Given the laws of probability,
from any point of view

737
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:03,972
about half of them
should be spinning clockwise

738
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:06,016
and the other half
counterclockwise.

739
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:09,227
But over 80% of them
are spinning clockwise.

740
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,104
You're saying people
are having accidents

741
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:13,565
because of the way
the neutrinos
are spinning?

742
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,483
No, but I think
it's a symptom

743
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,194
of the same problem.

744
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:20,072
The neutrinos outside
the station are normal

745
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:21,573
but inside the station

746
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:24,701
something very strange
is going on.

747
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:26,745
Have a good game, Julian.

748
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,705
You, too.

749
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:41,300
First point, O'Brien,
breaking the serve

750
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,553
and so it begins.

751
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,441
2-0, O'Brien.

752
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,985
Not a rousing start
for The Doctor.

753
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,488
Where is she?

754
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:04,116
Who?

755
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:06,618
Alsia. She was supposed
to meet me here

756
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:08,327
to tell me
how the bid went.

757
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:10,080
I still don't think
it's fair

758
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,957
you investing my
money without asking.

759
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:13,666
Your money?

760
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,460
You promised me
one-quarter
of the profits

761
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,629
but then you gave her
everything we earned.

762
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:20,632
I promised you one-quarter of
the profits<i> after</i> expenses.

763
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:23,927
Expenses?
What expenses?

764
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:27,513
Operating costs, overhead,
recapitalization.

765
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:30,600
Ooh, that does it.

766
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:33,311
Where are you going?

767
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,938
Back to Quark.

768
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:37,356
At least then
I'll get cheated by family.

769
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:39,442
Let's get out of here.

770
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,746
Ooh, another bad
break for Bashir.

771
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,539
9-3, O'Brien.

772
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:56,876
Quark, I'm cutting
the transmission.

773
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,586
What? You can't.

774
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,963
Watch me.

775
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:02,465
(<i> crowd complains</i> )

776
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:05,218
Ladies and
gentlemen

777
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:07,804
the players have called
a three-minute break.

778
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:09,806
Betting is reopened.

779
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:12,391
Three minutes,
three minutes only.

780
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:13,518
Why did you do that?

781
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,020
Something's wrong here.

782
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,521
With me, maybe

783
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,273
but you're having
a great game.

784
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:20,275
Yeah, the best I've
played my entire life.

785
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:22,735
I'm making shots
I couldn't have
made 15 years ago

786
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:25,363
when I was playing five
hours a day, every day.

787
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,199
I can't miss.

788
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:30,493
And I can't hit the broadside
of a Plygorian mammoth.

789
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:33,371
Try throwing the ball
against the wall.

790
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:41,046
It should have come
straight back to me.

791
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:42,672
You try.

792
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:04,777
O'Brien to Ops.

793
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:12,827
(<i> ball thwacking off walls</i> )

794
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:15,538
It goes right into his hand
every single time.

795
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,498
I must have done it
a dozen times by now

796
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:18,958
and I haven't missed yet.

797
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,044
Nobody could be that lucky.
It's impossible.

798
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:23,380
Not impossible,
just extremely improbable.

799
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,257
Improbable?

800
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:27,800
Like the neutrinos on the
station spinning the same way

801
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,054
or a few dozen people
having minor accidents

802
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:32,764
at the same instant

803
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:35,308
or a system failing
just at the wrong time.

804
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:36,726
Exactly.

805
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:38,686
Someone or something
on this station

806
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,563
is distorting the laws
of probability.

807
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:43,066
Changing them
so incredibly
unlikely things

808
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:44,609
can happen on
a regular basis.

809
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:46,945
How can we find out
what's causing it?

810
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:49,030
I think I know a way.

811
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,413
98% of the neutrinos
in this room

812
00:40:56,413 --> 00:40:58,290
are rotating clockwise.

813
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,624
The games are open.

814
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,709
We're not here
to play. Dax?

815
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:04,212
100% clockwise.

816
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:05,504
It's these machines.

817
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:06,839
What, my gambling
machines?

818
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,633
What's wrong with them?

819
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:11,136
Somehow, these machines
are altering

820
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:13,263
the laws of probability
all over the station.

821
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:15,473
So,<i> that's</i> what he meant.

822
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,891
Who?

823
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,435
The alien who gave me
the original.

824
00:41:18,435 --> 00:41:21,562
He said it all came down
to luck.

825
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,606
That must be how it works.

826
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,900
When you win,
it makes you lucky.

827
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,110
When you lose...

828
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,694
DAX:
But these machines

829
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:30,113
are affecting
everyone on the station

830
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:31,656
whether they're playing
them or not.

831
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:33,741
Impossible.
You must be mistaken.

832
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,201
Wait a minute.

833
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,494
You said there was
an original machine?

834
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,371
Yes, a smaller one.

835
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:41,666
When I opened the club,
I replicated these larger ver...

836
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:45,253
Larger versions.

837
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:49,257
So, how do you
turn them off?

838
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:51,634
I'm not completely sure.

839
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:53,803
Then how did you turn them
on in the first place?

840
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:55,596
I didn't... exactly.

841
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,807
I just told the replicator

842
00:41:57,807 --> 00:42:02,103
to scan the original
and make copies.

843
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:06,232
I think they have some kind
of internal power source.

844
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:08,151
Lieutenant.

845
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:11,529
Wait, wait, wait!
What are you doing?

846
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:16,951
Now, as for you...

847
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,911
You can't possibly blame me
for this, Commander.

848
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:20,205
Oh, I'd like to.

849
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:21,664
Unfortunately,
I don't have

850
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:22,957
anything I can
charge you with.

851
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:25,084
Fortunately, I do.

852
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:27,586
That elderly Pythron
couple you "assisted"

853
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:29,172
has had a change of heart.

854
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:31,799
They've decided to
press charges after all.

855
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:49,775
Alsia!

856
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:52,695
I knew you'd come to get me out.

857
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,864
Inside.

858
00:42:58,535 --> 00:43:00,203
What's the meaning of this?

859
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:01,787
Ask him.

860
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:04,457
Your lady friend here
just tried to scam me.

861
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:06,167
Scam?

862
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:07,668
Asteroid mining.

863
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,795
To think anyone
would be foolish enough

864
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:11,630
to be taken in
by that old trick.

865
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:14,842
But don't worry, Martus,
I've come to get you out.

866
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:17,095
In return for what?

867
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:19,472
Nothing.
Pure generosity.

868
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:20,973
Huh!

869
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:25,144
You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

870
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:28,773
Oh, taken in by one
of your own victims

871
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:30,567
and no one to turn to but me?

872
00:43:30,567 --> 00:43:31,776
(<i> laughing</i> )

873
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:34,112
I can't remember when I've been

874
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:35,530
so entertained.

875
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,907
I'm glad
you're enjoying yourself.

876
00:43:37,907 --> 00:43:40,659
Now, how about
giving me 2,000 isiks

877
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:42,454
to book passage out of here?

878
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:47,041
You want<i> me</i> to give<i> you</i> money?

879
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,877
Ridiculous.

880
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:52,922
Of all the ungrateful arrogance.

881
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:57,093
Unless you want me
to stay here on the station.

882
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,805
All right.

883
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:04,725
I'll<i> loan</i> you 500 isiks.

884
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:07,395
You can book passage
on a cargo ship.

885
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:10,440
1,500. After all,
I do have expenses.

886
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,941
600.

887
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:14,611
1,200.
I still have my dignity.

888
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:16,737
Dignity and an empty sack
is worth the sack--

889
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:19,115
Rule of Acquisition
Number 109.

890
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:21,826
All right.

891
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:25,121
800.

892
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:27,873
Go on.

893
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,459
I'm listening.
