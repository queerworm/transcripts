1
00:00:10,212 --> 00:00:13,707
When my husband was alive,
we ran the business together

2
00:00:13,753 --> 00:00:15,518
and I managed to put away

3
00:00:15,556 --> 00:00:18,551
a bit of latinum
every year just for myself.

4
00:00:18,596 --> 00:00:21,193
Now he's gone, well...

5
00:00:21,234 --> 00:00:24,570
I've got quite a little sum.

6
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,305
That's important.

7
00:00:26,344 --> 00:00:28,576
Well, to be honest,
it's not enough...

8
00:00:28,616 --> 00:00:30,050
not for the future...

9
00:00:30,085 --> 00:00:33,650
not for the way I want
to live out my retirement.

10
00:00:33,693 --> 00:00:36,426
So, I've decided
to invest it all in...

11
00:00:36,464 --> 00:00:39,334
I can't believe
I'm telling you this.

12
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,738
I just met you.

13
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,406
But I feel like
I can really trust you.

14
00:00:44,447 --> 00:00:46,713
It's like I've
known you forever.

15
00:00:46,752 --> 00:00:51,125
When hearts are in sympathy,
time collapses.

16
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,993
I'm taking everything I saved

17
00:00:53,031 --> 00:00:55,559
and I'm purchasing
the mining concession

18
00:00:55,603 --> 00:00:58,734
on the entire
Vlugtan asteroid belt.

19
00:00:58,776 --> 00:01:02,271
How ambitious, and such
an adventurous undertaking

20
00:01:02,316 --> 00:01:04,947
for a woman
of your delicate sensibilities.

21
00:01:04,988 --> 00:01:06,422
But are you sure that's wise?

22
00:01:06,457 --> 00:01:07,686
Prospecting can be risky.

23
00:01:07,727 --> 00:01:09,218
Not this time.

24
00:01:09,296 --> 00:01:11,927
My father was
a stellar cartographer.

25
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:14,964
30 years ago, he conducted
a full spectrum

26
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,205
mineral analysis
of those asteroids

27
00:01:17,246 --> 00:01:20,879
but he never had the means
to follow up on what he found.

28
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,553
And now you plan to carry
out your father's dream.

29
00:01:24,594 --> 00:01:27,259
When his survey results
become public

30
00:01:27,332 --> 00:01:30,931
I'll get seven times
my investment back... overnight.

31
00:01:30,973 --> 00:01:35,745
I still can't believe
I'm telling you this.

32
00:01:35,783 --> 00:01:38,049
My secret plan.

33
00:01:38,087 --> 00:01:40,650
I've been thinking
about it for years.

34
00:01:40,693 --> 00:01:42,663
I never even told my husband.

35
00:01:42,697 --> 00:01:44,929
It must be
all this Gamzian wine.

36
00:01:46,304 --> 00:01:48,297
How brave you are

37
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:52,109
to do all of this on your own.

38
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:53,812
It hasn't been easy.

39
00:01:53,853 --> 00:01:58,659
There's so much to keep
track of, so much to do.

40
00:01:58,696 --> 00:02:01,293
Maybe I could help.

41
00:02:04,006 --> 00:02:08,846
Would you consider some
kind of partnership?

42
00:02:08,883 --> 00:02:10,614
Let's go.

43
00:02:10,653 --> 00:02:12,680
Exactly where are we going?

44
00:02:12,724 --> 00:02:14,124
To Security.

45
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:16,026
But I've done nothing wrong.

46
00:02:16,063 --> 00:02:17,896
It's true.
We were just talking.

47
00:02:17,934 --> 00:02:19,733
You were talking, Madam.

48
00:02:19,771 --> 00:02:21,262
He was listening.

49
00:02:24,246 --> 00:02:26,113
Security Chief Odo, isn't it?

50
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,122
I've been watching you
ever since you arrived.

51
00:02:29,156 --> 00:02:30,716
Should I be flattered?

52
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,960
Martus Mazur, a refugee
from the El-Aurian system.

53
00:02:33,999 --> 00:02:37,028
Well, everyone has to be
from somewhere.

54
00:02:37,072 --> 00:02:38,905
Where are you from, Odo?

55
00:02:38,943 --> 00:02:41,140
Don't pull that routine on me.

56
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,478
What routine?

57
00:02:42,516 --> 00:02:44,679
I know all about you El-Aurians.

58
00:02:44,721 --> 00:02:47,522
You're listeners.
People like to talk to you.

59
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:50,360
Everyone has to have
someone to confide in...

60
00:02:50,398 --> 00:02:52,527
someone to hear their stories.

61
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:54,266
I offer a sympathetic ear

62
00:02:54,306 --> 00:02:56,674
and if they request my help,
I give it to them.

63
00:02:56,712 --> 00:02:58,306
That couple
from Pythro V told me

64
00:02:58,348 --> 00:03:00,511
you asked for their
financial access codes.

65
00:03:00,552 --> 00:03:02,579
Some might call helping
an elderly couple

66
00:03:02,623 --> 00:03:04,684
invest their savings
a compassionate act.

67
00:03:04,728 --> 00:03:07,700
Not when you invest it
in your own business...

68
00:03:07,734 --> 00:03:09,704
a business that promptly folds.

69
00:03:09,738 --> 00:03:12,038
I had a run of bad luck.

70
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:14,238
No one regrets it
more than I do.

71
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:15,976
You're a con man.

72
00:03:16,017 --> 00:03:17,782
And they've signed a complaint.

73
00:03:19,123 --> 00:03:20,990
This isn't necessary.

74
00:03:21,027 --> 00:03:23,555
It really isn't necessary.

75
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:25,898
I'm not going anywhere.

76
00:03:25,936 --> 00:03:27,599
Let's have a drink.

77
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:29,575
Talk a bit?

78
00:05:45,715 --> 00:05:46,705
Chief.

79
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,413
Hello, Doctor.

80
00:05:48,454 --> 00:05:49,479
Great job.

81
00:05:49,523 --> 00:05:51,720
You built it yourself,
didn't you?

82
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,423
Yeah, just finished.

83
00:05:53,464 --> 00:05:54,932
I missed playing

84
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:57,906
and I figured
there would be at least

85
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,410
a couple of other players
on board.

86
00:06:00,445 --> 00:06:02,745
Didn't think
you'd be one of them.

87
00:06:02,782 --> 00:06:05,447
Captain of the team
at Starfleet Medical Academy.

88
00:06:05,488 --> 00:06:07,481
We took the Sector Championships
in my final year.

89
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:09,722
Against other medical students?

90
00:06:09,763 --> 00:06:11,061
Against everybody.

91
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,002
Played a Vulcan in the finals.

92
00:06:13,037 --> 00:06:14,505
Talk about stamina.

93
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:16,600
Didn't think he ever actually
broke a sweat.

94
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:18,077
And you won?

95
00:06:18,114 --> 00:06:20,107
Took him
on a back wall riser shot.

96
00:06:21,787 --> 00:06:23,484
Oh, well, I can't say

97
00:06:23,524 --> 00:06:27,521
I've had much in the way
of formal training myself

98
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:31,437
but it's been a serious pastime
for a lot of years.

99
00:06:31,473 --> 00:06:33,841
Oh, some of the toughest players
I've come up against

100
00:06:33,878 --> 00:06:35,643
didn't really know
what they were doing.

101
00:06:35,681 --> 00:06:36,740
Really?

102
00:06:36,784 --> 00:06:39,118
Ah... formally, I mean.

103
00:06:40,324 --> 00:06:42,226
Hey, whatever works, works.

104
00:06:42,262 --> 00:06:43,662
This exercise, for example

105
00:06:43,697 --> 00:06:46,225
I picked up at a tournament
from a top player.

106
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,297
It's a 5,000-year-old
battle warm-up.

107
00:06:50,144 --> 00:06:51,237
According to the legend

108
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,761
it makes the heart
a friend to the hand.

109
00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:00,468
Medically, I don't really know
what that means

110
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,377
but, uh, it seems to give me
a lot of energy.

111
00:07:02,414 --> 00:07:04,577
Fancy a game?

112
00:07:04,618 --> 00:07:06,109
Serve.

113
00:07:06,155 --> 00:07:09,150
I guess by the lines,
you prefer the old-style rules?

114
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:14,626
I can play any style you like.

115
00:07:14,671 --> 00:07:16,368
Traditional it is, then.

116
00:07:16,408 --> 00:07:18,037
Always been
my personal favorite.

117
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,742
Serve.

118
00:07:27,898 --> 00:07:30,266
One.

119
00:07:41,158 --> 00:07:43,925
Pardon me, friend.

120
00:07:48,506 --> 00:07:50,908
Pardon me.

121
00:08:27,584 --> 00:08:30,385
Friend...

122
00:08:30,423 --> 00:08:33,122
friend, are you all right?

123
00:08:34,965 --> 00:08:37,562
I thought you died.

124
00:08:37,604 --> 00:08:40,405
If only I could be
so fortunate.

125
00:08:40,443 --> 00:08:42,572
You were snoring.

126
00:08:42,614 --> 00:08:44,846
Please accept my apologies.

127
00:08:44,885 --> 00:08:47,253
I didn't mean to disturb you.

128
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:52,062
But, as you can see,
my health is not so good.

129
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:55,537
Yes. Well, I'm sorry
I had to wake you.

130
00:08:55,573 --> 00:08:58,306
I wasn't always like this.

131
00:08:58,345 --> 00:08:59,711
Of course not.

132
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:03,882
I had youth, vigor, fame...

133
00:09:03,923 --> 00:09:07,727
wealth beyond measure.

134
00:09:07,764 --> 00:09:10,565
All gone.

135
00:09:10,603 --> 00:09:14,441
I'm not listening.

136
00:09:16,115 --> 00:09:19,349
All because of this.

137
00:09:26,235 --> 00:09:28,102
A gambling device?

138
00:09:31,712 --> 00:09:34,946
Did you win?

139
00:09:34,985 --> 00:09:37,217
Of course not.

140
00:09:37,257 --> 00:09:40,752
You gambled away
everything you had?

141
00:09:40,796 --> 00:09:42,823
In a manner of speaking.

142
00:09:42,867 --> 00:09:47,274
Every trade deal I struck
was a disaster.

143
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,337
Every alliance I formed
fell apart.

144
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:54,119
Every endeavor backed,
a failure.

145
00:09:54,191 --> 00:09:56,661
Well, what does this
have to do with a toy?

146
00:09:56,695 --> 00:09:59,462
Sounds like you just had
a lot of rotten luck.

147
00:09:59,501 --> 00:10:00,469
Yes...

148
00:10:00,503 --> 00:10:02,564
rotten luck.

149
00:10:02,607 --> 00:10:09,349
In the end,
it all comes down to luck.

150
00:10:14,931 --> 00:10:17,265
I won!

151
00:10:17,303 --> 00:10:18,362
That's nice.

152
00:10:18,405 --> 00:10:19,999
What did you win?

153
00:10:44,056 --> 00:10:47,028
Officer...

154
00:10:47,062 --> 00:10:49,932
you've got
a dead prisoner in here.

155
00:10:49,968 --> 00:10:52,461
Officer!

156
00:10:59,621 --> 00:11:01,648
How'd it go?

157
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:12,509
Good workout?

158
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:13,981
Medical school...

159
00:11:14,016 --> 00:11:16,179
Captain of the team
at medical school.

160
00:11:16,221 --> 00:11:18,418
Who are you talking about?

161
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:20,122
Bashir.

162
00:11:20,161 --> 00:11:21,527
You had a game?

163
00:11:21,565 --> 00:11:23,033
No, he had a game.

164
00:11:23,067 --> 00:11:25,469
I just kind of stumbled around
the court for 90 minutes

165
00:11:25,506 --> 00:11:26,997
and made
a complete ass of myself.

166
00:11:27,042 --> 00:11:29,239
I'm sure
he didn't see it that way.

167
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,250
The hell he didn't...

168
00:11:31,318 --> 00:11:33,949
that smug look on his face.

169
00:11:33,989 --> 00:11:37,052
"I guess you prefer
old-style rules."

170
00:11:37,095 --> 00:11:39,258
Like I was some kind of fossil.

171
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:42,601
In my day, I could have wiped
the court with him.

172
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,803
That's a point.
You're not a kid anymore.

173
00:11:44,844 --> 00:11:47,816
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

174
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,820
People just naturally slow down.

175
00:11:49,854 --> 00:11:52,290
Oh, like molasses in winter,
huh?

176
00:11:52,326 --> 00:11:53,658
Thanks.

177
00:11:53,695 --> 00:11:56,496
Miles, you're taking this
way too seriously.

178
00:11:56,535 --> 00:11:59,098
I'm out of shape, that's all.

179
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:01,507
I just need to get me wind back.

180
00:12:01,545 --> 00:12:03,538
Sector champion, my eye.

181
00:12:03,582 --> 00:12:06,952
He's vulnerable
to every one of my best shots.

182
00:12:09,327 --> 00:12:13,427
I just...
I just couldn't get them there.

183
00:12:13,469 --> 00:12:15,336
This time.

184
00:12:20,983 --> 00:12:23,044
I thought he was going
to have a heart attack.

185
00:12:23,087 --> 00:12:25,250
Come on, Julian,
it couldn't have been that bad.

186
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:26,818
No, really,
his face was flushed.

187
00:12:26,862 --> 00:12:28,160
I could have taken his pulse

188
00:12:28,197 --> 00:12:30,167
just watching
the side of his neck.

189
00:12:30,201 --> 00:12:31,464
Then why didn't you stop it?

190
00:12:31,505 --> 00:12:32,939
Well, don't think
I didn't try.

191
00:12:32,974 --> 00:12:34,603
After the first game,
I told him I had

192
00:12:34,644 --> 00:12:36,078
an appointment...
he ignored me.

193
00:12:36,113 --> 00:12:38,276
After the second game,
I told him I was getting tired.

194
00:12:38,318 --> 00:12:39,616
He didn't believe me.

195
00:12:39,654 --> 00:12:42,990
And then his racket broke,
and I thought, "Finally..."

196
00:12:43,027 --> 00:12:44,461
But no, he made me stay there

197
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,865
while he went away
and replicated another one.

198
00:12:46,902 --> 00:12:48,336
So, what finally happened?

199
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:51,807
While he was gone

200
00:12:51,845 --> 00:12:53,815
I called my assistant
and told her...

201
00:12:53,849 --> 00:12:55,443
May I?

202
00:12:55,486 --> 00:12:57,456
...told her to call me back
after five minutes

203
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,790
and say there was an emergency
at the Infirmary.

204
00:12:59,827 --> 00:13:00,795
Oh, that's terrible.

205
00:13:00,829 --> 00:13:02,161
There was no other way out.

206
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,464
Otherwise, there would have been
an emergency...

207
00:13:04,504 --> 00:13:05,767
Chief O'Brien's coronary.

208
00:13:05,806 --> 00:13:08,072
Well, at least it's all over.

209
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,203
That's just it.

210
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,216
This is just the beginning.

211
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,083
The Chief wants a rematch

212
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,921
and I'm telling you,
it's going to kill him.

213
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,759
Honestly, Julian,
you're exaggerating.

214
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,790
O'Brien can't be a day over 38.

215
00:13:19,834 --> 00:13:22,202
That's too young to die.

216
00:13:24,877 --> 00:13:28,008
I guess I'm overstating
the health risk.

217
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,350
That's not the point.

218
00:13:30,422 --> 00:13:32,187
The Chief has a lot of pride

219
00:13:32,225 --> 00:13:33,193
and for good reason.

220
00:13:33,227 --> 00:13:35,129
I really respect him...
the things he does

221
00:13:35,164 --> 00:13:36,564
the kind of man he is.

222
00:13:38,237 --> 00:13:41,904
I just... I just don't
want to humiliate him.

223
00:13:50,744 --> 00:13:52,373
Another winner.

224
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:53,883
What luck.

225
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:57,219
The Pythron couple
has refused to press charges.

226
00:13:57,323 --> 00:13:58,791
You can go.

227
00:13:58,827 --> 00:13:59,795
Of course.

228
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:02,129
Didn't I tell you?

229
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:04,695
They're my friends.

230
00:14:07,378 --> 00:14:08,607
All right.

231
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:10,480
Double or nothing.

232
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,646
House always takes blue.

233
00:14:12,688 --> 00:14:14,624
Sorry, the drink's on you.

234
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:16,127
Can I help you?

235
00:14:16,161 --> 00:14:17,652
Prosecco.

236
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,797
And how do you plan
on paying for this?

237
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,308
With charm, perhaps?

238
00:14:23,342 --> 00:14:24,810
Double or nothing.

239
00:14:24,846 --> 00:14:27,043
Double nothing is still nothing.

240
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,178
If I lose, I'll give you this.

241
00:14:29,221 --> 00:14:31,954
House always takes blue.

242
00:14:35,968 --> 00:14:37,459
Lucky.

243
00:14:37,505 --> 00:14:38,837
My luck's running good today.

244
00:14:38,874 --> 00:14:40,434
So I've heard.

245
00:14:40,477 --> 00:14:42,504
Decided not to testify,
did they?

246
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,245
I don't know what you mean.

247
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:45,649
No?

248
00:14:45,687 --> 00:14:47,748
The 47th Rule
of Acquisition says

249
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:50,763
"Don't trust a man wearing
a better suit than your own."

250
00:14:50,797 --> 00:14:52,767
Either you're a con artist

251
00:14:52,801 --> 00:14:55,067
or you're covering up
an empty coin purse.

252
00:14:55,106 --> 00:14:57,269
I happen to know it's both.

253
00:14:57,343 --> 00:15:00,213
Well, we can't be all
as successful as you are.

254
00:15:02,555 --> 00:15:04,320
Too true.

255
00:15:12,441 --> 00:15:13,739
Some kind of game?

256
00:15:13,777 --> 00:15:15,245
I've never seen that one before.

257
00:15:15,313 --> 00:15:16,246
How do you play?

258
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,376
Just press the key.

259
00:15:27,504 --> 00:15:29,474
Too bad.

260
00:15:37,891 --> 00:15:41,193
As I told you,
my luck's running good today.

261
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,030
Am I supposed to be impressed?

262
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:44,697
A little tinkering

263
00:15:44,739 --> 00:15:47,005
some replication
and expansion...

264
00:15:47,043 --> 00:15:50,209
It might make
a nice addition to your casino.

265
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,809
And who would play this?

266
00:15:51,853 --> 00:15:54,848
It's just a child's toy.

267
00:15:54,892 --> 00:15:57,864
My nephew, um...

268
00:15:57,898 --> 00:16:01,429
it might keep him out of my ears
for a couple of days.

269
00:16:01,472 --> 00:16:02,667
I'll take it.

270
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:05,680
That's a tidy sum.

271
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:08,686
I'm feeling benevolent today.

272
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,154
Have another.

273
00:16:15,332 --> 00:16:19,397
I might have accepted,
but the offer of the drink...

274
00:16:19,441 --> 00:16:22,470
that tells me
you're very interested.

275
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:25,315
Nonsense.
You read too much into nothing.

276
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:27,915
My benevolence
is known far and wide.

277
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:31,453
Oh, it's legendary, I'm sure.

278
00:16:31,499 --> 00:16:36,339
I'll take 100 times
what you've got here.

279
00:16:36,408 --> 00:16:39,312
Not in this space-time
continuum, you won't.

280
00:16:39,347 --> 00:16:43,651
Go try to peddle this little
triviality down on Bajor.

281
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:46,253
You might be able
to trade it for a meal

282
00:16:46,294 --> 00:16:48,355
but it won't be a hot one.

283
00:16:48,432 --> 00:16:52,566
You'll be in profit
by the end of the week.

284
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,810
Final offer.

285
00:16:58,853 --> 00:17:01,187
Take it before
my generosity fades.

286
00:17:10,509 --> 00:17:13,743
Perhaps I'll hold onto it
a bit longer.

287
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,753
Suit yourself.

288
00:17:15,787 --> 00:17:17,757
But be under no illusion...

289
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:21,458
if I was serious about
acquiring this, it would be mine

290
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:24,163
and for substantially less
than what you had hoped for.

291
00:17:24,204 --> 00:17:25,798
It seems that overconfidence

292
00:17:25,841 --> 00:17:28,073
comes in small packages
around here.

293
00:17:28,111 --> 00:17:30,639
My track record
speaks for itself

294
00:17:30,684 --> 00:17:33,018
just like your security file.

295
00:17:36,662 --> 00:17:39,793
Thanks for the drink.

296
00:18:07,123 --> 00:18:08,752
Times are difficult.

297
00:18:08,793 --> 00:18:09,988
Oh, it's not that.

298
00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:11,258
Business was good.

299
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:13,200
Then why are you shutting down?

300
00:18:13,235 --> 00:18:16,071
My husband and I ran
this place for nine years.

301
00:18:16,107 --> 00:18:20,070
Before that, we had
a shop on Bajor for 17.

302
00:18:20,115 --> 00:18:23,519
But a few months ago,
he passed away

303
00:18:23,555 --> 00:18:27,256
and my heart's
just not in it anymore.

304
00:18:27,296 --> 00:18:29,357
Not the same, is it?

305
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,836
Working by yourself?

306
00:18:31,872 --> 00:18:33,739
No.

307
00:18:33,776 --> 00:18:37,546
It's so much nicer
working next to someone else.

308
00:18:48,806 --> 00:18:50,776
You understand.

309
00:18:58,191 --> 00:18:59,352
Nice shot.

310
00:19:14,323 --> 00:19:15,621
Damn!

311
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,570
You think I'm stupid, too, hmm?

312
00:19:21,604 --> 00:19:24,269
I... don't know
what you're talking about.

313
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,473
I don't need your charity.

314
00:19:26,514 --> 00:19:28,780
Next time, you either
play your best game

315
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,311
or you don't play.

316
00:19:38,538 --> 00:19:39,506
He can't do this.

317
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,031
I have an exclusive contract.

318
00:19:41,077 --> 00:19:42,170
I want him arrested.

319
00:19:42,213 --> 00:19:43,842
Who are you talking about?

320
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:45,512
Martus, that listener.

321
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:46,884
What's he done?

322
00:19:46,922 --> 00:19:48,390
Just look.

323
00:19:48,425 --> 00:19:50,395
Welcome, friends.

324
00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:51,727
Welcome, welcome.

325
00:19:51,765 --> 00:19:56,571
Welcome to Club Martus.

326
00:20:10,737 --> 00:20:12,035
I have a contract

327
00:20:12,072 --> 00:20:13,974
for which I paid considerably.

328
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,946
All gambling at DS9

329
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,950
happens at Quark's,
or it doesn't happen.

330
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:20,547
A few bribes to the Cardassians
when they ran this place

331
00:20:20,589 --> 00:20:21,921
doesn't constitute a contract.

332
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:23,485
Not in the eyes
of the Federation.

333
00:20:23,528 --> 00:20:25,293
He's a con artist, a crook.

334
00:20:25,332 --> 00:20:27,598
One more won't make
much difference.

335
00:20:27,636 --> 00:20:29,196
Need I remind you
that without me

336
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,176
the other merchants
would have abandoned

337
00:20:31,211 --> 00:20:32,840
this station
after the occupation.

338
00:20:32,881 --> 00:20:34,042
You owe me!

339
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:37,522
You begged me to stay here
when you first came on board

340
00:20:37,556 --> 00:20:40,026
and I did,
against my better judgment.

341
00:20:40,062 --> 00:20:41,622
I didn't beg.
I blackmailed you.

342
00:20:41,731 --> 00:20:43,860
And don't pretend it hasn't
paid off for you either.

343
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:46,466
It's paid off fine until now.

344
00:20:46,507 --> 00:20:48,636
Martus is cutting
into my profits.

345
00:20:48,745 --> 00:20:51,238
I want him stopped,
before it gets any worse.

346
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:53,652
Too late for that, my brother.

347
00:20:53,756 --> 00:20:55,316
What's the meaning of this?

348
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:57,887
I've promised
your underpaid sibling

349
00:20:57,931 --> 00:21:01,335
a one-quarter partnership
in my establishment.

350
00:21:01,371 --> 00:21:03,364
Make me a better offer.

351
00:21:03,408 --> 00:21:05,844
A... a bidding war, over you?

352
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,907
Ha, don't make me laugh.

353
00:21:09,654 --> 00:21:11,317
Careful, Martus.

354
00:21:11,357 --> 00:21:13,452
He shaves the latinum.

355
00:21:13,495 --> 00:21:14,963
I do not.

356
00:21:14,998 --> 00:21:16,489
Not much.

357
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,781
Martus?

358
00:21:34,915 --> 00:21:36,008
I've just received word

359
00:21:36,084 --> 00:21:38,520
the Vlugtan government
has accepted my bid.

360
00:21:38,555 --> 00:21:40,149
Well, that's wonderful.

361
00:21:41,963 --> 00:21:43,397
What's wrong?

362
00:21:43,432 --> 00:21:45,595
They won't finalize
the transaction

363
00:21:45,636 --> 00:21:50,169
until I commission a study on
the effects of asteroid mining

364
00:21:50,212 --> 00:21:51,875
on inner-system navigation.

365
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,943
All my money is
committed to the bid.

366
00:21:53,987 --> 00:21:56,048
I can't afford the study

367
00:21:56,157 --> 00:21:59,220
and I only have
a week to get it done.

368
00:21:59,264 --> 00:22:00,961
How much do you need?

369
00:22:01,001 --> 00:22:03,734
10,000 isiks.

370
00:22:03,772 --> 00:22:05,366
10,000 isiks?

371
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:08,279
It won't be easy to raise
that kind of money.

372
00:22:08,315 --> 00:22:09,283
I know, I know.

373
00:22:09,317 --> 00:22:11,787
I hope I can find
an investor in time.

374
00:22:11,821 --> 00:22:13,620
I might know someone.

375
00:22:13,659 --> 00:22:15,822
But what kind of return

376
00:22:15,864 --> 00:22:18,802
can they expect
on their investment?

377
00:22:18,835 --> 00:22:23,868
Well, once I began mining,
I'd pay back ten times 10,000.

378
00:22:23,913 --> 00:22:26,578
Don't worry, Alsia.

379
00:22:26,618 --> 00:22:29,749
I'll do everything in my power
to keep your dream alive.

380
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:32,057
Oh, Martus.

381
00:22:32,096 --> 00:22:35,627
I don't know how to thank you.

382
00:22:35,669 --> 00:22:37,468
Is there some problem, Rom?

383
00:22:37,506 --> 00:22:38,974
Not with this batch

384
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:42,780
but, with my brother around,
you can never be too careful.

385
00:22:42,817 --> 00:22:44,480
You mean to say
he'd poison the canapés?

386
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,988
Maybe not poison

387
00:22:46,024 --> 00:22:48,017
but a small intestinal bug?

388
00:22:48,061 --> 00:22:49,894
I wouldn't put it past him.

389
00:22:49,932 --> 00:22:51,731
Oh, don't worry about Quark.

390
00:22:51,768 --> 00:22:54,968
I've had the most astonishing
run of luck lately.

391
00:22:55,009 --> 00:22:57,138
I'm beginning to think
I can do no wrong.

392
00:23:01,287 --> 00:23:02,755
Neatness counts.

393
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,122
Never think it doesn't.

394
00:23:08,668 --> 00:23:10,763
A toast...

395
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,867
to the Queen of the Promenade.

396
00:23:12,911 --> 00:23:16,213
A woman whose business
acumen is matched

397
00:23:16,251 --> 00:23:18,744
only by her beauty and charm.

398
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:20,588
Have I missed anything?

399
00:23:20,626 --> 00:23:22,094
To you...

400
00:23:22,129 --> 00:23:24,361
my treasure.

401
00:23:25,836 --> 00:23:28,467
Are you as pleased as I am?

402
00:23:28,508 --> 00:23:30,273
What do you think?

403
00:23:30,312 --> 00:23:33,045
I think we make
quite a good team.

404
00:23:33,085 --> 00:23:37,618
Perhaps we should consider
formalizing our relationship.

405
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:41,464
Are you proposing to me?

406
00:23:41,501 --> 00:23:44,371
What do you think?

407
00:23:44,407 --> 00:23:47,436
Oh, it's beautiful.

408
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,179
You deserve nothing less.

409
00:23:52,923 --> 00:23:54,756
And these are wonderful.

410
00:23:54,794 --> 00:23:56,593
Where did you find them?

411
00:23:56,631 --> 00:23:58,099
I had them replicated

412
00:23:58,135 --> 00:24:00,401
from a hand-held version
a friend gave me.

413
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,375
I've never seen
anything like them.

414
00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:04,038
No one has.

415
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,606
All right.
Is this everything

416
00:24:05,649 --> 00:24:07,015
you'll need for the lab?

417
00:24:07,052 --> 00:24:08,543
I think so.

418
00:24:10,225 --> 00:24:11,854
I don't believe it.

419
00:24:11,895 --> 00:24:13,363
Believe what?

420
00:24:13,398 --> 00:24:15,995
I've had the computer looking
for this program for weeks.

421
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:18,132
It was buried somewhere
in the deep code level

422
00:24:18,175 --> 00:24:19,701
right before
the Cardassians left.

423
00:24:19,744 --> 00:24:21,042
Huh. How did you find it?

424
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,982
I'm not sure.
It's more like it found me.

425
00:24:23,018 --> 00:24:24,612
Just lucky, I guess.

426
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:28,158
I am so sorry.

427
00:24:28,261 --> 00:24:29,286
What happened?

428
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:31,357
Well, you served.
I returned low.

429
00:24:31,401 --> 00:24:32,927
You slipped on the ball.

430
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,097
I slipped on a ball?

431
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,574
Stepped right on it,
mid-flight.

432
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:36,907
Never seen anything like it.

433
00:24:38,181 --> 00:24:39,707
Easy now, let me check you out.

434
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,379
I'm fine. Serve.

435
00:24:41,421 --> 00:24:43,755
Dr. Bashir,
report to the Infirmary.

436
00:24:43,792 --> 00:24:46,730
I'm sorry, Chief.
I have to go.

437
00:24:46,764 --> 00:24:48,529
I'll get you next time, okay?

438
00:24:48,568 --> 00:24:50,036
Look, about that...

439
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:51,803
It's just that...
I guess I don't enjoy

440
00:24:51,841 --> 00:24:53,309
this game
as much as I used to.

441
00:24:53,345 --> 00:24:55,076
I hope you don't mind.

442
00:24:55,115 --> 00:24:56,914
I'm sure you'll find
another opponent.

443
00:25:16,124 --> 00:25:18,526
Where is everybody?

444
00:25:18,561 --> 00:25:21,931
My friendly competitor's place.

445
00:25:21,968 --> 00:25:23,597
A listener.

446
00:25:23,638 --> 00:25:25,198
So what?

447
00:25:25,309 --> 00:25:26,938
So he listens.

448
00:25:26,978 --> 00:25:28,607
I can listen.

449
00:25:28,648 --> 00:25:30,880
I can listen as well as anyone.

450
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:32,217
What happened?

451
00:25:32,256 --> 00:25:34,590
I fell down.

452
00:25:34,627 --> 00:25:35,925
See? I'm listening.

453
00:25:35,962 --> 00:25:37,089
Nothing to it.

454
00:25:37,132 --> 00:25:38,623
How did you fall down?

455
00:25:38,668 --> 00:25:41,640
Playing racquetball with Bashir.

456
00:25:41,674 --> 00:25:43,200
Where?

457
00:25:43,244 --> 00:25:45,578
At the court.
Where do you think?

458
00:25:45,615 --> 00:25:47,244
What was the score?

459
00:25:47,286 --> 00:25:48,254
Who cares?

460
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,449
I care. I'm listening.

461
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,958
Tell me your problems.
All of them.

462
00:25:50,992 --> 00:25:53,657
I've got no problems
a good drop shot wouldn't cure.

463
00:25:53,698 --> 00:25:54,666
He beat you.

464
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,260
Only by half a step, that's all.

465
00:25:56,371 --> 00:25:58,899
He's got a few years on me,
so what?

466
00:25:58,942 --> 00:26:00,775
I've got more experience.

467
00:26:00,812 --> 00:26:02,280
The aging champion...

468
00:26:02,316 --> 00:26:04,309
I've got spin shots
he's never seen.

469
00:26:04,353 --> 00:26:05,982
...versus the daring challenger.

470
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,616
So I had a few bad breaks, huh?

471
00:26:07,659 --> 00:26:09,526
One more game,
that's all I needed.

472
00:26:09,563 --> 00:26:10,622
Come one, come all...

473
00:26:10,665 --> 00:26:12,760
I could have kicked him
all over the court

474
00:26:12,803 --> 00:26:13,828
and he knows it, too.

475
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:15,033
Welcome to Quark's.

476
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:16,977
Thanks.

477
00:26:17,011 --> 00:26:18,878
Don't mention it.

478
00:26:18,915 --> 00:26:23,448
Quark's House of Champions.

479
00:26:23,491 --> 00:26:24,459
Damn!

480
00:26:24,493 --> 00:26:25,620
Something wrong, Major?

481
00:26:25,662 --> 00:26:27,153
My terminal just
self-destructed.

482
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:28,394
What?

483
00:26:28,435 --> 00:26:31,168
I lost an evaluation report
I've been working on for weeks.

484
00:26:31,207 --> 00:26:32,197
Even the backups?

485
00:26:32,242 --> 00:26:33,836
Even the backups.

486
00:26:33,878 --> 00:26:36,679
Funny. I've been hearing
a lot of bad luck stories

487
00:26:36,717 --> 00:26:37,980
in the last few hours.

488
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,283
Doctor Bashir tells me

489
00:26:39,323 --> 00:26:41,054
the Infirmary is full
of minor accidents.

490
00:26:41,092 --> 00:26:42,287
People slipping and falling

491
00:26:42,329 --> 00:26:43,661
walking through
turbolift doors

492
00:26:43,698 --> 00:26:45,292
before they open...
that kind of thing.

493
00:26:45,402 --> 00:26:46,870
Well, I've had a great day

494
00:26:46,904 --> 00:26:49,136
so don't try sending
your misfortunes my way.

495
00:26:49,176 --> 00:26:50,576
Come on, you make
your own luck.

496
00:26:50,612 --> 00:26:53,048
We all know that.

497
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:07,667
They all hit the jackpot
at once?

498
00:27:07,713 --> 00:27:10,844
Is there any way
I can blame this on you?

499
00:27:10,886 --> 00:27:12,515
I don't think so.

500
00:27:12,556 --> 00:27:14,185
No, I suppose not.

501
00:27:14,226 --> 00:27:17,054
All right.
Pay them all off.

502
00:27:17,187 --> 00:27:20,125
Challenge of the Galaxy.

503
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:24,294
Match of the Century.

504
00:27:24,335 --> 00:27:29,175
Wonder of the Wormhole.

505
00:27:33,853 --> 00:27:36,518
House always takes blue.

506
00:27:41,101 --> 00:27:44,734
If it's action you want,
you've come to the right place.

507
00:27:44,775 --> 00:27:47,508
Excitement?
We've got it all.

508
00:27:47,548 --> 00:27:51,318
Thrills and spills.
Victory and defeat.

509
00:27:51,355 --> 00:27:54,350
Look no further,
we've got it all.

510
00:27:54,395 --> 00:27:58,563
And here he is... the reigning
champion of Starfleet...

511
00:27:58,603 --> 00:28:00,596
a legend on both sides
of the wormhole.

512
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,507
Ladies and gentlemen

513
00:28:02,544 --> 00:28:05,380
Miles "The Mechanic" O'Brien.

514
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:11,121
What's this all about?

515
00:28:11,161 --> 00:28:13,028
I got an emergency call.

516
00:28:13,065 --> 00:28:14,694
Well, so did I

517
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:16,762
but I don't see any emergency.

518
00:28:16,872 --> 00:28:18,774
And the challenger.

519
00:28:18,876 --> 00:28:22,714
He's fast, he's deadly,
he's Julian Bashir.

520
00:28:22,751 --> 00:28:25,587
They call him "The Doctor."

521
00:28:25,624 --> 00:28:28,892
The grudge match of the galaxy.

522
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:31,059
Get down here.

523
00:28:31,101 --> 00:28:33,469
And all for a worthy cause.

524
00:28:33,506 --> 00:28:36,740
Yes, these noble competitors
have insisted

525
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:39,910
that I donate half
the house's winnings

526
00:28:39,952 --> 00:28:42,515
to the Bajoran Fund for Orphans.

527
00:28:42,557 --> 00:28:44,288
Orphans?

528
00:28:46,131 --> 00:28:48,762
The Mechanic versus The Doctor.

529
00:28:48,803 --> 00:28:50,773
Tomorrow, 1200 hours.

530
00:28:50,807 --> 00:28:55,545
Only one will emerge victorious,
so place your bets

531
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:59,546
and in the meantime,
the tables are open.

532
00:28:59,591 --> 00:29:01,458
This is outrageous.

533
00:29:01,495 --> 00:29:04,365
We haven't agreed to anything.

534
00:29:04,401 --> 00:29:05,699
As your exclusive promoter

535
00:29:05,737 --> 00:29:07,798
I have the right
to arrange matches as I see fit.

536
00:29:07,908 --> 00:29:09,069
Exclusive promoter?

537
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,373
Just sign here.

538
00:29:10,413 --> 00:29:11,642
Forget it, Quark.

539
00:29:11,682 --> 00:29:18,093
I understand how you feel,
but... think of the children.

540
00:29:18,128 --> 00:29:20,827
The monks have already
made a down payment

541
00:29:20,867 --> 00:29:22,837
on new blankets for the winter.

542
00:29:22,904 --> 00:29:25,967
Ah, well, I'm sure
the little ones

543
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:28,675
can huddle together for warmth.

544
00:29:30,987 --> 00:29:35,325
Looks like you're going to get
that rematch after all.

545
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:04,751
I don't believe it.

546
00:30:04,788 --> 00:30:07,351
The program I found...
it disappeared.

547
00:30:07,394 --> 00:30:09,694
Have you checked
the deep code level?

548
00:30:09,731 --> 00:30:10,699
No luck.

549
00:30:10,733 --> 00:30:11,928
It's funny.

550
00:30:11,969 --> 00:30:14,668
It's like the computer brought
that program up at random

551
00:30:14,708 --> 00:30:17,305
and then just swallowed
it up again.

552
00:30:17,347 --> 00:30:18,941
Major, you're all right.

553
00:30:19,016 --> 00:30:21,213
Not even a sprain,
which is more than I can say

554
00:30:21,254 --> 00:30:22,917
for everybody else
in the Infirmary.

555
00:30:22,958 --> 00:30:24,518
Still crowded?

556
00:30:24,561 --> 00:30:26,929
Yeah, and Doctor Bashir tells me
it's a whole new batch.

557
00:30:26,966 --> 00:30:27,956
More minor accidents?

558
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,127
Dozens of them.

559
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:31,903
Could there be a connection
between the accidents

560
00:30:31,942 --> 00:30:34,641
and the increase
in the system failures?

561
00:30:34,681 --> 00:30:36,878
I didn't get hurt
by a system failure

562
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:38,319
I tripped and fell.

563
00:30:38,356 --> 00:30:40,919
Just coincidence, that's all.

564
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,864
There must be a logical
explanation for all this.

565
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,770
Maybe a virus or some kind
of spatial disruption.

566
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:48,775
It would have to be something

567
00:30:48,809 --> 00:30:51,109
that would affect
both people and machinery.

568
00:30:51,147 --> 00:30:52,581
Get on it.

569
00:30:56,057 --> 00:30:58,620
I always had smaller lobes
than the rest of the boys.

570
00:30:58,663 --> 00:31:00,257
They used to tease me about it.

571
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:01,597
Quark was the worst.

572
00:31:01,635 --> 00:31:03,400
He told everyone I was adopted.

573
00:31:03,439 --> 00:31:06,070
I just don't understand.
Things were going so well.

574
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:08,137
On my Naming Day,
Quark substituted

575
00:31:08,181 --> 00:31:10,481
old vegetables for my presents.

576
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,681
Then he sold the presents

577
00:31:11,722 --> 00:31:13,487
for more than our father
had paid...

578
00:31:13,526 --> 00:31:17,626
I couldn't care less
about your trivial childhood!

579
00:31:20,807 --> 00:31:25,374
We've been virtually abandoned
and I want to know why.

580
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:27,750
A bad streak... it happens.

581
00:31:27,787 --> 00:31:29,814
Not to me, it doesn't.

582
00:31:29,858 --> 00:31:31,521
I require the comfort

583
00:31:31,562 --> 00:31:33,532
of a compassionate soul.

584
00:31:37,807 --> 00:31:40,004
Don't think I didn't see
through you

585
00:31:40,045 --> 00:31:42,447
right from the start.

586
00:31:43,619 --> 00:31:45,748
It's a joke.
Really.

587
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,053
Well, in case

588
00:31:47,126 --> 00:31:50,326
you've forgotten, I still
hold the lease on this place.

589
00:31:50,365 --> 00:31:52,893
I want you out of here
by tomorrow

590
00:31:52,937 --> 00:31:55,670
and take those damn things
with you.

591
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:58,546
But... but...
but...

592
00:31:59,818 --> 00:32:01,447
But, treasure.

593
00:32:01,488 --> 00:32:04,016
Oh, I knew no good
would come of this.

594
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,689
I never should have left Quark.

595
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:07,324
What's going to happen now?

596
00:32:07,366 --> 00:32:08,732
I'm not sure.

597
00:32:12,276 --> 00:32:14,839
But I have an idea.

598
00:32:25,536 --> 00:32:27,768
The profits from the club.

599
00:32:27,807 --> 00:32:31,713
I believe it comes
to just about 10,000 isiks.

600
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:35,917
Oh, Martus, you don't know
what this means to me.

601
00:32:35,957 --> 00:32:38,086
I know what it means to me...

602
00:32:38,128 --> 00:32:40,462
ten times as much in return.

603
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,402
You won't regret this.

604
00:32:42,436 --> 00:32:45,067
You'll see.
We'll both be rich.

605
00:33:05,315 --> 00:33:08,549
You can beat his backhand.

606
00:33:08,589 --> 00:33:10,183
Keep the ball low

607
00:33:10,225 --> 00:33:11,819
and to his left.

608
00:33:14,501 --> 00:33:16,937
Corner return on the serve.

609
00:33:19,109 --> 00:33:22,742
Then kill shot left.

610
00:33:22,784 --> 00:33:25,847
If he returns again

611
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:29,351
high back wall.

612
00:33:29,396 --> 00:33:31,025
And remember...

613
00:33:31,067 --> 00:33:34,973
Win or lose,
tonight we celebrate.

614
00:33:40,887 --> 00:33:43,119
Miles, wait.

615
00:33:46,698 --> 00:33:49,465
A silk handkerchief

616
00:33:49,503 --> 00:33:53,773
medieval Japanese design...

617
00:33:53,812 --> 00:33:56,875
scented with my perfume.

618
00:34:02,162 --> 00:34:04,725
Kick his butt.

619
00:34:12,015 --> 00:34:15,146
Doctor, I brought you something.

620
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:18,625
A token of thanks from the monks
to show you how much

621
00:34:18,662 --> 00:34:20,130
they appreciate
your participation

622
00:34:20,165 --> 00:34:21,394
in their little fund-raiser.

623
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:22,766
Oh, thanks.
Put it over there.

624
00:34:22,804 --> 00:34:26,299
Um, aren't you going
to try some?

625
00:34:26,344 --> 00:34:27,812
What is it?

626
00:34:27,847 --> 00:34:30,444
The monks tell me
it's a medicinal brew...

627
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,717
an ancient secret
of their order.

628
00:34:32,757 --> 00:34:35,729
It's supposed to impart
great energy and vigor.

629
00:34:35,763 --> 00:34:40,330
Just the kind of thing to have
before an athletic competition.

630
00:34:40,372 --> 00:34:44,779
But... you're
a man of science.

631
00:34:44,814 --> 00:34:47,752
You probably don't believe
in folk medicine.

632
00:34:47,787 --> 00:34:49,187
Actually, you'd be surprised

633
00:34:49,223 --> 00:34:51,056
just how often
traditional medicine

634
00:34:51,093 --> 00:34:53,086
turns out to have genuine value.

635
00:34:53,131 --> 00:34:54,794
Did they say
what was in this stuff?

636
00:34:54,834 --> 00:34:56,029
They didn't exactly

637
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:58,667
but I'm sure it's all
completely natural.

638
00:34:58,709 --> 00:35:00,975
Oh, the monks said
you should drink the whole thing

639
00:35:01,013 --> 00:35:03,108
in one gulp in order
to get the proper effect.

640
00:35:03,151 --> 00:35:04,950
Did they?

641
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:10,593
What are you doing?

642
00:35:10,637 --> 00:35:12,869
Just curious about its contents.

643
00:35:12,908 --> 00:35:15,208
Uh... what about your exercises?

644
00:35:15,245 --> 00:35:16,805
This won't take a second.

645
00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:18,078
Oh, why bother?

646
00:35:18,185 --> 00:35:20,087
Don't you trust the monks?

647
00:35:21,157 --> 00:35:23,525
Ah, water, sucrose, dextrose

648
00:35:23,562 --> 00:35:25,293
tribnel root extract

649
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:28,897
grain particulates,
yeast, synthehol...

650
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:31,035
and 17 milligrams

651
00:35:31,077 --> 00:35:35,575
of hyvroxilated
quint-ethyl metacetamine.

652
00:35:35,619 --> 00:35:37,589
Like I said, all natural.

653
00:35:37,623 --> 00:35:39,786
It's an anesthetic, Quark.

654
00:35:39,828 --> 00:35:41,957
If I drank that,
I'd hardly be able to stand

655
00:35:41,999 --> 00:35:43,331
let alone play racquetball.

656
00:35:43,368 --> 00:35:45,235
You were trying to fix
the match, weren't you?

657
00:35:45,272 --> 00:35:46,501
Would I do that?

658
00:35:46,541 --> 00:35:49,274
If you had enough latinum bet
on Chief O'Brien, you would.

659
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:52,251
No one's betting
on Chief O'Brien.

660
00:35:52,286 --> 00:35:53,276
All the money's on you.

661
00:35:53,321 --> 00:35:55,052
If you win, there
won't be any profits.

662
00:35:55,092 --> 00:35:57,928
And if there aren't any profits

663
00:35:57,964 --> 00:36:01,425
I can't donate
anything to the monks.

664
00:36:01,471 --> 00:36:06,436
No donations, no winter blankets
for the children.

665
00:36:06,481 --> 00:36:13,018
But... if you lose,
then the house would win

666
00:36:13,061 --> 00:36:15,999
and the monks would
get their blankets.

667
00:36:16,034 --> 00:36:19,063
Are you suggesting
that I throw the match?

668
00:36:20,977 --> 00:36:22,138
For the children.

669
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:23,146
Forget it, Quark.

670
00:36:23,248 --> 00:36:24,546
But the blankets...

671
00:36:24,584 --> 00:36:26,486
Will be provided by you
one way or another.

672
00:36:26,521 --> 00:36:28,514
And if the monks don't get
their blankets

673
00:36:28,558 --> 00:36:30,653
Chief O'Brien and I
will be very upset.

674
00:36:30,697 --> 00:36:32,462
Do I make myself clear?

675
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,470
Perfectly.

676
00:36:34,504 --> 00:36:39,811
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a match to play.

677
00:36:47,363 --> 00:36:48,923
Kira said you've found
something.

678
00:36:48,966 --> 00:36:50,366
Oh, I found something,
all right.

679
00:36:50,402 --> 00:36:51,893
I just don't know what it means.

680
00:36:51,939 --> 00:36:53,032
Look at this.

681
00:36:53,074 --> 00:36:54,440
Solar neutrinos.

682
00:36:54,477 --> 00:36:55,604
Notice anything unusual?

683
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:57,046
There are a lot of them?

684
00:36:57,082 --> 00:36:58,676
The spin.

685
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:01,486
Given the laws of probability,
from any point of view

686
00:37:01,524 --> 00:37:04,826
about half of them
should be spinning clockwise

687
00:37:04,865 --> 00:37:07,335
and the other half
counterclockwise.

688
00:37:07,369 --> 00:37:10,466
But over 80% of them
are spinning clockwise.

689
00:37:10,509 --> 00:37:12,308
You're saying people
are having accidents

690
00:37:12,346 --> 00:37:15,807
because of the way
the neutrinos are spinning?

691
00:37:15,854 --> 00:37:19,315
No, but I think it's a symptom
of the same problem.

692
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,332
The neutrinos outside
the station are normal

693
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:23,960
but inside the station

694
00:37:24,003 --> 00:37:26,975
something very strange
is going on.

695
00:37:27,009 --> 00:37:28,672
Have a good game, Julian.

696
00:37:28,712 --> 00:37:30,203
You, too.

697
00:37:39,868 --> 00:37:42,704
First point, O'Brien,
breaking the serve

698
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:45,074
and so it begins.

699
00:37:55,934 --> 00:37:57,961
2-0, O'Brien.

700
00:37:58,004 --> 00:38:00,532
Not a rousing start
for The Doctor.

701
00:38:02,212 --> 00:38:03,841
Where is she?

702
00:38:03,883 --> 00:38:05,512
Who?

703
00:38:05,552 --> 00:38:08,183
Alsia. She was supposed
to meet me here

704
00:38:08,224 --> 00:38:10,023
to tell me how the bid went.

705
00:38:10,062 --> 00:38:11,530
I still don't think it's fair

706
00:38:11,564 --> 00:38:13,363
you investing my money
without asking.

707
00:38:13,401 --> 00:38:14,927
Your money?

708
00:38:14,972 --> 00:38:16,805
You promised me
one-quarter of the profits

709
00:38:16,842 --> 00:38:18,835
but then you gave her
everything we earned.

710
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:22,215
I promised you one-quarter
of the profits after expenses.

711
00:38:22,252 --> 00:38:25,383
Expenses?
What expenses?

712
00:38:25,425 --> 00:38:29,024
Operating costs, overhead,
recapitalization.

713
00:38:29,066 --> 00:38:32,197
Ooh, that does it.

714
00:38:33,976 --> 00:38:35,239
Where are you going?

715
00:38:35,278 --> 00:38:36,268
Back to Quark.

716
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,716
At least then
I'll get cheated by family.

717
00:38:38,752 --> 00:38:40,881
Let's get out of here.

718
00:38:48,505 --> 00:38:51,944
Ooh, another bad break
for Bashir.

719
00:38:51,979 --> 00:38:55,145
9-3, O'Brien.

720
00:38:55,185 --> 00:38:58,316
Quark, I'm cutting
the transmission.

721
00:38:58,425 --> 00:39:00,054
What? You can't.

722
00:39:00,095 --> 00:39:01,495
Watch me.

723
00:39:04,036 --> 00:39:06,667
Ladies and gentlemen

724
00:39:06,707 --> 00:39:09,679
the players have called
a three-minute break.

725
00:39:09,713 --> 00:39:11,273
Betting is reopened.

726
00:39:11,317 --> 00:39:13,719
Three minutes,
three minutes only.

727
00:39:13,755 --> 00:39:14,916
Why did you do that?

728
00:39:14,958 --> 00:39:16,426
Something's wrong here.

729
00:39:16,461 --> 00:39:19,763
With me, maybe,
but you're having a great game.

730
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,827
Yeah, the best I've played
my entire life.

731
00:39:21,872 --> 00:39:24,308
I'm making shots I couldn't
have made 15 years ago

732
00:39:24,343 --> 00:39:26,779
when I was playing
five hours a day, every day.

733
00:39:26,814 --> 00:39:28,443
I can't miss.

734
00:39:28,485 --> 00:39:32,050
And I can't hit the broadside
of a Plygorian mammoth.

735
00:39:32,092 --> 00:39:34,825
Try throwing the ball
against the wall.

736
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:42,471
It should have come
straight back to me.

737
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:44,176
You try.

738
00:40:04,223 --> 00:40:06,386
O'Brien to Ops.

739
00:40:14,376 --> 00:40:16,904
It goes right into his hand
every single time.

740
00:40:16,949 --> 00:40:18,816
I must have done it
a dozen times by now

741
00:40:18,851 --> 00:40:20,114
and I haven't missed yet.

742
00:40:20,155 --> 00:40:21,418
Nobody could be that lucky.

743
00:40:21,457 --> 00:40:22,891
It's impossible.

744
00:40:22,927 --> 00:40:24,920
Not impossible,
just extremely improbable.

745
00:40:24,965 --> 00:40:26,594
Improbable?

746
00:40:26,634 --> 00:40:29,435
Like the neutrinos on the
station spinning the same way

747
00:40:29,473 --> 00:40:32,570
or a few dozen people
having minor accidents

748
00:40:32,613 --> 00:40:34,013
at the same instant

749
00:40:34,049 --> 00:40:36,748
or a system failing
just at the wrong time.

750
00:40:36,787 --> 00:40:38,085
Exactly.

751
00:40:38,124 --> 00:40:40,287
Someone or something
on this station

752
00:40:40,328 --> 00:40:42,321
is distorting the laws
of probability.

753
00:40:42,366 --> 00:40:43,766
Changing them so incredibly

754
00:40:43,801 --> 00:40:45,549
unlikely things
can happen on a regular basis.

755
00:40:45,682 --> 00:40:47,447
How can we find out
what's causing it?

756
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:49,956
I think I know a way.

757
00:40:55,569 --> 00:40:57,163
98% of the neutrinos
in this room

758
00:40:57,206 --> 00:40:59,073
are rotating clockwise.

759
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,578
The games are open.

760
00:41:00,612 --> 00:41:02,548
We're not here to play.
Dax?

761
00:41:02,583 --> 00:41:04,109
100% clockwise.

762
00:41:04,153 --> 00:41:05,747
It's these machines.

763
00:41:05,822 --> 00:41:07,689
What, my gambling machines?

764
00:41:07,726 --> 00:41:09,559
What's wrong with them?

765
00:41:09,597 --> 00:41:11,999
Somehow, these machines
are altering

766
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:14,735
the laws of probability
all over the station.

767
00:41:14,774 --> 00:41:16,573
So, that's what he meant.

768
00:41:16,611 --> 00:41:17,579
Who?

769
00:41:17,613 --> 00:41:19,242
The alien who gave me
the original.

770
00:41:19,283 --> 00:41:21,914
He said it all came down
to luck.

771
00:41:21,954 --> 00:41:24,390
That must be how it works.

772
00:41:24,427 --> 00:41:26,795
When you win,
it makes you lucky.

773
00:41:26,898 --> 00:41:27,797
When you lose...

774
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,368
But these machines

775
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:30,735
are affecting
everyone on the station

776
00:41:30,772 --> 00:41:32,104
whether they're playing
them or not.

777
00:41:32,142 --> 00:41:34,544
Impossible.
You must be mistaken.

778
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,775
Wait a minute.

779
00:41:35,816 --> 00:41:37,445
You said there was
an original machine?

780
00:41:37,486 --> 00:41:38,818
Yes, a smaller one.

781
00:41:38,922 --> 00:41:42,453
When I opened the club,
I replicated these larger ver...

782
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:46,136
Larger versions.

783
00:41:47,673 --> 00:41:50,075
So, how do you turn them off?

784
00:41:50,112 --> 00:41:52,605
I'm not completely sure.

785
00:41:52,649 --> 00:41:54,744
Then how did you turn them
on in the first place?

786
00:41:54,787 --> 00:41:56,347
I didn't... exactly.

787
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:58,792
I just told the replicator

788
00:41:58,828 --> 00:42:02,198
to scan the original
and make copies.

789
00:42:02,236 --> 00:42:07,144
I think they have some kind
of internal power source.

790
00:42:07,179 --> 00:42:08,944
Lieutenant.

791
00:42:08,982 --> 00:42:12,318
Wait, wait, wait!
What are you doing?

792
00:42:16,297 --> 00:42:17,629
Now, as for you...

793
00:42:17,666 --> 00:42:19,761
You can't possibly blame me
for this, Commander.

794
00:42:19,804 --> 00:42:20,999
Oh, I'd like to.

795
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,773
Unfortunately, I don't have
anything I can charge you with.

796
00:42:23,812 --> 00:42:25,975
Fortunately, I do.

797
00:42:26,016 --> 00:42:28,715
That elderly Pythron
couple you "assisted"

798
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:30,691
has had a change of heart.

799
00:42:30,725 --> 00:42:33,526
They've decided to
press charges after all.

800
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,596
Alsia!

801
00:42:50,632 --> 00:42:52,795
I knew you'd come to get me out.

802
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:55,672
Inside.

803
00:42:59,383 --> 00:43:01,012
What's the meaning of this?

804
00:43:01,052 --> 00:43:02,520
Ask him.

805
00:43:02,556 --> 00:43:05,187
Your lady friend here
just tried to scam me.

806
00:43:05,228 --> 00:43:06,857
Scam?

807
00:43:06,964 --> 00:43:08,262
Asteroid mining.

808
00:43:08,301 --> 00:43:10,635
To think anyone
would be foolish enough

809
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:12,403
to be taken in
by that old trick.

810
00:43:12,442 --> 00:43:15,710
But don't worry, Martus,
I've come to get you out.

811
00:43:15,749 --> 00:43:17,878
In return for what?

812
00:43:17,953 --> 00:43:20,185
Nothing.
Pure generosity.

813
00:43:20,225 --> 00:43:21,888
Huh!

814
00:43:23,631 --> 00:43:25,897
You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

815
00:43:26,002 --> 00:43:29,441
Oh, taken in
by one of your own victims

816
00:43:29,476 --> 00:43:31,309
and no one to turn to but me?

817
00:43:32,616 --> 00:43:36,386
I can't remember when I've been
so entertained.

818
00:43:36,424 --> 00:43:38,860
I'm glad
you're enjoying yourself.

819
00:43:38,895 --> 00:43:41,388
Now, how about
giving me 2,000 isiks

820
00:43:41,434 --> 00:43:43,529
to book passage out of here?

821
00:43:43,571 --> 00:43:47,602
You want me to give you money?

822
00:43:47,646 --> 00:43:49,616
Ridiculous.

823
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:54,319
Of all the ungrateful arrogance.

824
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:58,027
Unless you want me
to stay here on the station.

825
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:01,873
All right.

826
00:44:01,907 --> 00:44:05,813
I'll loan you 500 isiks.

827
00:44:05,849 --> 00:44:08,514
You can book passage
on a cargo ship.

828
00:44:08,554 --> 00:44:11,492
1,500.
After all, I do have expenses.

829
00:44:11,527 --> 00:44:13,018
600.

830
00:44:13,063 --> 00:44:15,728
1,200.
I still have my dignity.

831
00:44:15,769 --> 00:44:18,400
Dignity and an empty sack
is worth the sack...

832
00:44:18,441 --> 00:44:19,739
Rule of Acquisition
Number 109.

833
00:44:21,781 --> 00:44:24,412
All right.

834
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:26,218
800.

835
00:44:26,257 --> 00:44:28,922
Go on.

836
00:44:28,961 --> 00:44:31,354
I'm listening.
