00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:06,966
SISKO:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 51408.6.</i>

2
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:09,384
<i>I've been aboard the Honshu</i>
<i>for two days now</i>

3
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:11,470
<i>and I still</i>
<i>haven't spoken to him</i>

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,263
<i>although the doctors</i>
<i>have assured me</i>

5
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:14,849
<i>that he's made a full recovery.</i>

6
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,851
<i>Maybe that's</i>
<i>what I'm afraid of.</i>

7
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:21,438
<i>Maybe I prefer to think of him</i>
<i>as a crazy man... a broken man.</i>

8
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:24,608
<i>He'd be</i>
<i>less dangerous that way.</i>

9
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,360
<i>As terrible as it sounds,</i>

10
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,446
<i>there's a part of me</i>
<i>that wishes he were dead,</i>

11
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:35,703
<i>but that's a thought unworthy</i>
<i>of a Starfleet Officer.</i>

12
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:40,499
<i>He lost an empire,</i>
<i>he lost his daughter,</i>
<i>and he nearly lost his mind.</i>

13
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:45,963
<i>Whatever his crimes</i>
<i>isn't that enough punishment</i>
<i>for one lifetime?</i>

14
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,847
I heard
you were aboard.

15
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:02,396
I was wondering
if you'd make an appearance.

16
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,481
How are you?

17
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,191
Better.

18
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:13,365
(<i> sighs</i> )

19
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:18,119
The doctors tell me
I've made a remarkable recovery.

20
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,247
They told me
the same thing.

21
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:21,790
Good.

22
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,251
I'd hate to think
they were patronizing me.

23
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,755
So I'm a war criminal.

24
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:30,215
In the Federation,
you're innocent
'till proven guilty.

25
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,800
So I'm told.

26
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:35,930
Do you believe I'm guilty,
Benjamin?

27
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:42,352
I haven't seen
all of the charges.

28
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,438
It's not like you to equivocate.

29
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,189
I'm trying
to be fair.

30
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,859
You won't be tried
until the war is over.

31
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,111
Your appearance before
the special jury

32
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,487
is just a formality.

33
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:56,324
And you'll be testifying
for the prosecution.

34
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,287
I will tell them what I know.

35
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,122
Care to elaborate?

36
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,291
Not really.

37
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,584
I see.

38
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:16,511
I never got a chance to tell you
how sorry I am about Ziyal.

39
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:24,311
Do I detect the fine hand
of Dr. Cox at work once again?

40
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:27,481
I told him I wanted
to offer my condolences.

41
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,069
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,197
The good doctor encourages me

43
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:38,492
to talk about Ziyal
whenever possible

44
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,910
since it was her...

45
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,289
death...

46
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:48,794
that brought on
my momentary instability.

47
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:51,088
I shouldn't be so suspicious.

48
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,465
It's all right.

49
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,222
Well...

50
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:04,434
we should be arriving
at Starbase 621

51
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,936
by noon tomorrow.

52
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,938
I will see you
at the arraignment.

53
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:12,901
Benjamin...

54
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,448
about my daughter...

55
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,827
you and Major Kira

56
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:24,746
took care of her
for almost a year.

57
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,581
I wanted to thank you
for that.

58
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,125
It was very generous.

59
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,548
Ziyal...

60
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:37,676
was a very special young woman.

61
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:40,846
It was a pleasure
to have her with us

62
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:43,098
even if it was
only a short time.

63
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:48,353
A short time
is all she ever had.

64
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:53,525
Is there anything
I can get for you?

65
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:55,736
Hmm.

66
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,989
A bottle of<i> kanar</i>

67
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:02,492
and an Orion slave girl
would be nice.

68
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,205
I'll see what I can do.

69
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,876
(<i> alarm blares</i> )

70
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,377
CREWMAN:
<i>Battle stations.</i>

71
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:15,630
<i>Damage control teams</i>
<i>report to Level 5-J.</i>

72
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,174
It's confirmed.

73
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:25,426
USS<i> Honshu</i> was destroyed
this morning at 1030 hours

74
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:28,889
by an attack wing
of Cardassian destroyers.

75
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,849
Starfleet<i> has</i> picked up
the distress beacons

76
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,310
from three escape pods
and one shuttlecraft

77
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,812
so there<i> are</i> survivors.

78
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,772
ODO:
The signals
are coming from this area.

79
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,525
The last reported position
of the<i> Honshu</i> was here

80
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,070
which means there could
be survivors in any of these

81
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,571
adjacent star systems.

82
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,156
That's a pretty
large area.

83
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,407
How many ships in
the search party?

84
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:51,203
Two-- the<i> Constellation</i>
and the<i> Defiant.</i>

85
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:52,537
Two? It could take days.

86
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,997
KIRA:
With all the
Dominion activity

87
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,540
along the border,

88
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,376
it's all Starfleet
can spare at the moment

89
00:06:57,376 --> 00:07:00,879
<i>and</i> the<i> Defiant</i> has
another appointment.

90
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,214
In 52 hours

91
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:04,925
you need to be at this
rendezvous point

92
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,386
outside the Badlands.

93
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:10,180
You are the escort
for a Federation troop convoy.

94
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,390
It will take 12 hours

95
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,599
just to arrive
at the coordinates

96
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:13,975
where the<i> Honshu</i> was destroyed.

97
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,936
And 12 more
to reach the Badlands, I know,

98
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,230
but this convoy
is completely unprotected.

99
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,232
They've been using
the plasma fields

100
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:22,067
in the Badlands
to hide their movements

101
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,403
and when they emerge, they're
helpless without the<i> Defiant.</i>

102
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:25,946
Can't they delay
the convoy?

103
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,989
I mean, if Captain
Sisko is still alive

104
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,157
we have to give
him every chance.

105
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,410
I raised
the same objection myself

106
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,203
and the orders still stand.

107
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,872
Now, every
minute spent

108
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:39,376
arguing here is one less minute
spent searching for the Captain.

109
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,211
Prepare
for immediate departure.

110
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,799
KIRA:
Worf...

111
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,218
there are over 30,000

112
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,429
Federation troops
in that convoy.

113
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:52,639
You have 52 hours,
not one second longer.

114
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,848
Understood?

115
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,309
Understood.

116
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,771
<i>Defiant.</i>

117
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,449
(<i> whoosh of hypospray</i> )

118
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,617
DUKAT:
Benjamin, can
you hear me?

119
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,454
Dukat?

120
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:16,746
Yes.

121
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,539
Everything's all right

122
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,917
but don't try
to move too quickly.

123
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,585
The left side
of your body

124
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,171
is covered with
plasma burns.

125
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,590
We were in the brig

126
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,634
and the ship went
to Red Alert.

127
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,136
We were attacked

128
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:35,056
by a wing of Cardassian
ships, ironically.

129
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,642
I was headed
to Engineering.

130
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,519
Well, you didn't
get very far.

131
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,229
A plasma conduit exploded

132
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,815
before you got 15 meters
down the corridor.

133
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:46,776
That's where Lieutenant
McConnell and I found you

134
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,862
when the order came
to abandon ship.

135
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,280
Where's McConnell?

136
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,781
Dead.

137
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:55,243
A piece of shrapnel
hit him in the head

138
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:59,789
just as we were carrying
you into the shuttle.

139
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,124
Any other survivors?

140
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:03,043
I saw
a few escape pods

141
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:06,129
leaving the ship
just before it exploded

142
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,881
but I had my hands full

143
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,175
just trying to keep
us in one piece.

144
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:15,472
The engines were damaged
from the shock waves

145
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:18,058
and I set us down here,

146
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,394
wherever "here" is.

147
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:21,644
But that shuttle's

148
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,563
never going
to reach orbit again.

149
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:30,153
The shuttle's distress
beacon was damaged...

150
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:32,739
(<i> beeping softly</i> )

151
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:36,117
but I think
I managed to repair it.

152
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:40,663
So now all we have to do
is wait for someone to pick up
our signal.

153
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,832
Whose signal
are you transmitting--

154
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,877
Starfleet or
the Dominion, hmm?

155
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:49,214
It's a general distress call,
Benjamin.

156
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:53,343
Whoever gets here first
will find one comrade-in-arms...

157
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,844
and one prisoner.

158
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,346
That's fair, isn't it?

159
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:57,764
Fair enough.

160
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,352
Did you do this?

161
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,979
You shattered most
of the bones in your arm.

162
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,690
There was a bone regenerator
in the medkit

163
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,569
but I'm afraid
I'm not much of a doctor

164
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:12,404
so I just
put on the cast.

165
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:14,948
You did plenty.

166
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,491
Thank you.

167
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,744
We have enough field rations

168
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,913
to last us a few weeks,
but I'd feel

169
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:23,540
better if I could locate

170
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,292
another source
of food and water.

171
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:31,339
The surface is inhospitable,
to say the least,

172
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:35,260
but I did manage to find
some firewood and kindling

173
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,471
so there's a good chance
there's edible vegetation

174
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,931
out there--
I just have to find it.

175
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,518
You could have left me behind.

176
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:44,685
Why didn't you?

177
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,438
I didn't want to.

178
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,442
I'll be back within the hour.

179
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,993
What are you planning
to do with him?

180
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,911
The Captain and I have
a lot to talk about.

181
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:02,954
Such as?

182
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:04,414
It's of a personal nature.

183
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,457
I see.

184
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,252
You're going
to share your feelings

185
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:10,337
of loneliness and sorrow

186
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,839
with your long-time
adversary.

187
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,215
Dr. Cox would be so proud.

188
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,134
Go away.

189
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,345
You should kill him now
while you still can.

190
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,846
That won't be necessary.

191
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,055
He's in no condition
to challenge me.

192
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,432
I can afford to be patient.

193
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,724
You should
kill him.

194
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,393
I don't care for your tone!

195
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,228
Spare me your
endless posturing.

196
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,063
You're lucky I
speak to you at all

197
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,899
after that pathetic display
back at the hospital.

198
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,151
That's enough.

199
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:36,112
Oh, I see. It's
a sensitive topic.

200
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,614
I wonder what Captain
Sisko would think

201
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,407
if he'd seen you
curled up in a ball

202
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,618
crying yourself
to sleep every night.

203
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,036
Stop it!

204
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,664
I doubt he'd still have
the same respect for you

205
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:49,626
if he'd heard you screaming
and screaming and screaming

206
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,919
like a madman 'till
the nurses came

207
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,589
and the doctors
had to sedate you.

208
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:57,925
(<i> laughing</i> )
No!

209
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,447
Is that breakfast?

210
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,490
(<i> chuckling</i> )

211
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,700
Possibly.

212
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,701
Good morning.

213
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:23,868
Morning.

214
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,912
What's it like outside?

215
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,788
Oh, the wind
has died down

216
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,542
and the temperature
has gone up 20 degrees.

217
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:31,918
I rather like it

218
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,920
but I think you'll
be more comfortable

219
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,088
in here where it's cooler.

220
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,091
Too much.

221
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,387
I'm doing the cooking here,
thank you.

222
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:43,471
Pardon me.

223
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,139
You're not the
only officer

224
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,392
who learned how to cook,
you know.

225
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:48,727
How are you feeling?

226
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:49,810
A little better.

227
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:50,853
Good.

228
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:51,896
After last night,

229
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,732
I was beginning to get worried.

230
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:54,815
Last night?

231
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:57,360
You don't remember?

232
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:02,657
Now that you mention it,
I remember waking up

233
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,701
and I was feeling
a little dizzy.

234
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:07,203
You had a bout
of nausea.

235
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,872
Not exactly a little bout.

236
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:10,831
Oh. I'm sorry.

237
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,083
That's all right.

238
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,793
I've had to clean up
a lot worse

239
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,087
in my time.

240
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,380
Once, when I was

241
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:21,134
a newly minted glinn
on the<i> Kornaire,</i>

242
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,885
I had to help
clean out a compartment

243
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:27,766
where three men had gone through
an explosive decompression.

244
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:29,100
(<i> chuckles</i> )

245
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,145
I didn't sleep for a week
after that.

246
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,730
Let's change the subject.

247
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,486
The Emissary has spoken.

248
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:43,740
Oh, come on, Benjamin.

249
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,451
Have a sense of humor
about all this.

250
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:48,286
I'm not in much
of a joking mood.

251
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,705
Well, that's a shame
because there's so much

252
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:53,333
to laugh about.

253
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,335
You don't see
it, do you?

254
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:58,004
Benjamin, just
a few hours ago

255
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,465
I was a prisoner
on my way to trial

256
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:03,343
and you were my
dear old friend

257
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,011
come to visit
me in my cell.

258
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,137
(<i> laughing</i> )

259
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:07,888
Now look at us.

260
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:12,226
I'm free, and you're a prisoner
of your own battered body,

261
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,479
and there's a good chance

262
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:18,941
we'll be rescued
by the Dominion.

263
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,360
(<i> laughing</i> )

264
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,529
You've got
to laugh at
a universe

265
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:27,283
that allows such radical shifts
in fortune, Benjamin.

266
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,161
I will laugh when
a Federation starship arrives

267
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:31,912
and puts you back in a cell.

268
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,289
(<i> laughs</i> )

269
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,082
Whatever you say.

270
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:38,878
What?

271
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,423
Nothing.

272
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:45,134
It's probably just the wind.

273
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:55,895
How is it?

274
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,355
Needs salt.

275
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,232
There's probably some

276
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,150
in one of the ration packs.

277
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:08,282
You know... we didn't get
much of a chance

278
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,660
to catch up
before the attack.

279
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,329
How is everybody
on what I'm sure

280
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,374
you're once again calling
Deep Space 9?

281
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:19,085
Odo and... Kira?
Quark?

282
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,545
They're all fine.

283
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:23,464
And, no, they don't miss you.

284
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,260
Perhaps not.

285
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,971
They never really did
give me much of a chance.

286
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:34,475
They were too busy
plotting my downfall.

287
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,018
Pepper.

288
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,064
If you only want
me to tell you

289
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,149
what you want
to hear, just say so.

290
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,572
Well, I hope
they at least told you

291
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,699
that my policies
toward the Bajorans

292
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,451
were most generous this time.

293
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:54,454
They told me Weyoun didn't
give you much of a choice.

294
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:58,082
Major Kira knows full well
I made every effort

295
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:02,169
to heal the wounds
between Cardassia and Bajor.

296
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,297
Since the very beginning,

297
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:08,092
it was my intention to rectify
the mistakes of the past

298
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:11,095
and begin a new chapter
in our relations.

299
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,433
Are you going
to put that in my soup?

300
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,518
Oh.

301
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,025
Well?

302
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,863
Better.

303
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,408
(<i> sighing</i> )

304
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:35,202
You're not going to give me
the benefit of the doubt

305
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,663
are you, Benjamin?

306
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,748
Do you really care what I think?

307
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:41,918
Don't<i> you</i> care what
your old friends think of<i> you?</i>

308
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:45,463
Dukat, we're not old friends.

309
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:48,758
You saved my life
and I'm grateful,

310
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:51,218
but that's as far as it goes.

311
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,015
You keep hearing
something.

312
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,434
Are you sure
there's nothing out there?

313
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:01,688
It's just the wind.

314
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:02,814
I'm certain.

315
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:09,946
But I'm going to double-check,
just to make sure.

316
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:18,830
No.

317
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,331
I won't do it-- not yet.

318
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:21,833
You're wasting time.

319
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,417
It's my time
to waste, Damar.

320
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,878
Remember your place.

321
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,337
I mean no
disrespect--

322
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:28,798
you know that-- but without you,

323
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:32,510
the war will be lost
and Cardassia will lie in ruins.

324
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,136
Don't let this one man

325
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,514
stand in the way
of your final triumph.

326
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:39,392
I have to know
that he respects me.

327
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,268
I think I've earned it.

328
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,687
Of course you have.

329
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,438
He's just trying

330
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:47,608
to deny you the satisfaction
of hearing him say it.

331
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,694
You know in
your heart

332
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,487
he secretly
admires you.

333
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,989
Isn't that enough?

334
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:56,409
Kill him and be done with it.

335
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,455
(<i> groaning</i> )

336
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,427
Think of it...

337
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:17,137
the leader of Cardassia

338
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:20,975
bringing the dead body
of the Emissary back

339
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,518
to the
Bajoran people.

340
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,853
They'll take
it as a sign

341
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:26,064
that the Prophets
have abandoned them.

342
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:28,148
The Shakaar government
will be overthrown

343
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:31,193
and the Federation position
on Terok Nor

344
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,987
will become untenable.

345
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,822
Very tempting thought.

346
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,732
You've made
some good points, Damar,

347
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:12,068
but there will be time enough
for all of that later.

348
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:15,195
It's all right.

349
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:18,324
I know you have
my best interests at heart.

350
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:25,081
I wanted to get
some water out of the kit.

351
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,248
Oh.

352
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:29,127
Here.

353
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:30,210
Thanks.

354
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,754
Oh...

355
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,131
Anything out there?

356
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:34,090
Hmm?

357
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,967
Uh, no. No.

358
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:39,929
Some rocks slid down the cliff.

359
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,723
I think something's wrong
with the com system.

360
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:46,477
Oh?

361
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:47,854
It was beeping a second ago.

362
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,063
It might need recalibrating.

363
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,692
I'll check.

364
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:56,904
Well...

365
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,364
everything's fine.

366
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,449
The unit's still on line.

367
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,409
If you open up the casing,

368
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:05,204
you'll be able to run
a full diagnostic.

369
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,873
Better safe than sorry.

370
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:09,208
You're right.

371
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:17,967
Ah...

372
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,097
Nothing to worry about.

373
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:25,432
It's working fine.

374
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,227
That's all I wanted to know.

375
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,071
WORF:
<i>Ship's Log, supplemental.</i>

376
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:41,365
<i>We have picked up a total</i>
<i>of 12</i> Honshu<i> survivors so far</i>

377
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,910
<i>but there is still</i>
<i>no sign of Captain Sisko.</i>

378
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,661
<i>We have less than 12 hours</i>

379
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,413
<i>before we must</i>
<i>abandon the search.</i>

380
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,101
(<i> grunts</i> )

381
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,487
(<i> beeping</i> )

382
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,241
(<i> powering down</i> )

383
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:24,450
Damn.

384
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,534
(<i> taps on console</i> )

385
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:29,455
(<i> beeping softly</i> )

386
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:30,456
(<i> sighs</i> )

387
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,457
(<i> console beeps</i> )

388
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:32,875
Commander, I'm picking up

389
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,376
a distress signal.

390
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,669
(<i> footsteps approaching</i> )

391
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:55,564
Good evening.

392
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,859
(<i> turns flashlight off</i> )

393
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,486
Pleasant dreams, I hope.

394
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:03,322
I don't remember.

395
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,324
Is it still dark out?

396
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,076
I do apologize

397
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,452
for bringing you

398
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,246
to such a gloomy
latitude.

399
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:12,331
The nights seem
to last 18 hours,

400
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,083
the days less
than five.

401
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,793
Sit up.

402
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:23,176
Well, looks like you're
planning a long stay.

403
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:24,551
Oh, no,
not at all.

404
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,344
Someone's bound
to pick up

405
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:28,181
our signal
any time now

406
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:29,598
but I see
no reason

407
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,684
why we shouldn't
be comfortable

408
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:32,977
in the meantime.

409
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:34,520
How's that?

410
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,022
That's just fine,
thank you.

411
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:37,731
Good.

412
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,743
Ah!

413
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,787
Much better, hmm?

414
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:56,834
You know,

415
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:59,920
when I was out there
in the shuttle just now,

416
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,255
it occurred to me

417
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:04,091
that the Bajorans
would be very confused

418
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,801
if they could see us here

419
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,888
sharing
the same food,

420
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:11,015
the same hardships.

421
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:13,059
What do you think they would say
if they knew

422
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:18,396
the Emissary of the Prophets
and the evil Gul Dukat

423
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:22,609
were sitting here,
together

424
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:25,363
getting along
just like the two old friends

425
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:26,822
that they really are?

426
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:32,786
Oh...

427
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:35,915
I... forgot.

428
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:39,417
You don't think of me
as your old friend

429
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:40,920
do you, Benjamin?

430
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,421
It's all right.

431
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:45,423
There's no one here.

432
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:47,467
Just the two of us.

433
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,845
No one to impress.

434
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:53,640
No one to judge what you say.

435
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,851
We can be honest
with each other.

436
00:23:57,395 --> 00:23:59,772
So tell me...

437
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,941
what do you really

438
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,734
think of me?

439
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:07,196
I'll tell you
what<i> I</i> think.

440
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:09,156
I think you're
an evil, sadistic man

441
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,199
who should
have been tried

442
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:12,285
as a war criminal
years ago--

443
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:14,787
put up against
a wall and shot.

444
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:17,873
(<i> chuckling</i> )

445
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:21,085
You probably agree
with Major Kira

446
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:23,003
don't you, Benjamin?

447
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,589
I<i> am</i> the former
Prefect of Bajor--

448
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,049
an evil man

449
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:30,468
who sent thousands of
Bajorans to their deaths

450
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:33,847
to satisfy his own
sadistic desires, hmm?

451
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:36,100
Of course,
he agrees with me

452
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,851
and it was<i> millions.</i>

453
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,854
I don't think there's any point
in discussing this.

454
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,856
I<i> do.</i>

455
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:47,653
My name and reputation
have been slandered and twisted

456
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,822
ever since the end
of the occupation

457
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:52,158
of Bajor.

458
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:54,285
I have been vilified...

459
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:59,039
by ignorant, small-minded people

460
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:03,043
throughout the Quadrant
for the past six years.

461
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:06,672
I just want to know
if you're one of them, Benjamin.

462
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:09,925
I wasn't there
during the occupation.

463
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,927
I didn't see all the things

464
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,388
you had to struggle with
day after day.

465
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:18,976
I don't think
I<i> can</i> pass judgment.

466
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:20,936
He just doesn't
want to anger you.

467
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,813
He really thinks
you're a vicious

468
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:24,940
cold-blooded killer,
Dukat, and so do I.

469
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,400
I don't care

470
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,861
what you think,
so I suggest

471
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,030
you keep your opinions
to yourself.

472
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,663
I don't think

473
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,041
you're being entirely honest
with me, Benjamin.

474
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:45,461
You're not a man who hesitates
to make snap judgments

475
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:47,421
when the situation calls for it.

476
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:50,632
It's one of the signs
of a good commander.

477
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:54,303
Now, I'm asking
for your opinion of me,

478
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:58,974
and I'd find it hard to believe
you don't have one.

479
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,976
All right.

480
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:05,231
I think you're right.

481
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:07,565
You<i> have</i> been judged unfairly.

482
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:09,943
<i>I've</i> judged
you unfairly

483
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:12,696
but I think you
probably had

484
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:15,074
good reasons
for everything you did on Bajor.

485
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:16,492
<i>Yes.</i>

486
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:18,869
Yes. That's it, exactly.

487
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:22,206
I had good reasons.

488
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:24,958
Some of the harsher actions
I took

489
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:28,128
were forced on me
by Central Command.

490
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:31,798
I wanted to use
entirely different tactics

491
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,675
with the Bajorans.

492
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:36,762
I wanted to rule
with a<i> softer</i> hand,

493
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:40,682
but my superiors
didn't see it that way.

494
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:43,601
You were a soldier, and you
had to carry out your orders.

495
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:45,354
Precisely.

496
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,189
(<i> raucous laughter</i> )

497
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:55,322
You are such a fool!

498
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:56,907
Leave us alone!

499
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:58,242
This doesn't

500
00:26:58,242 --> 00:26:59,617
concern you!

501
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:01,537
He's patronizing you.

502
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:02,996
"You were a soldier

503
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,873
and you had
to carry out your orders."

504
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,834
He doesn't believe
that lame excuse
any more than I do.

505
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,920
DUKAT:
This is growing
tiresome.

506
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,004
Dukat?

507
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:14,425
Dukat!

508
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:15,968
I thought you wanted
to talk to me.

509
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,677
Yes!

510
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,388
But Nerys won't

511
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:20,431
leave well enough
alone.

512
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:21,974
She's always
interfering,

513
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:24,642
always trying to upset me!

514
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:27,896
Maybe we should
just ignore her.

515
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:32,151
Let's pretend that
the Major's not even here.

516
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:40,159
I'm picking up two humanoid
life-forms on the surface.

517
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,077
Bridge to
Transporter Room.

518
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,703
There's no reason to get upset.

519
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,498
We're just
talking.

520
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:47,207
Two old
soldiers

521
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,543
talking around the campfire.

522
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:51,753
KIRA:
I'm going to enjoy
watching this.

523
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,755
He's going
to beat you, Dukat.

524
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,215
He's going
to escape

525
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,675
and go back to DS9
and his friends

526
00:27:57,675 --> 00:28:01,347
and we're all going
to have a good, long laugh

527
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:03,182
at<i> your</i> expense.

528
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:06,226
(<i> laughing</i> )

529
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:09,563
(<i> screaming</i> )

530
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:11,565
Enough!

531
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:13,442
(<i> laughing</i> )

532
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,989
(<i> laughter continues</i> )

533
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:22,951
(<i> laughter fades away</i> )

534
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:25,787
(<i> beeping</i> )

535
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,414
I've locked onto them.

536
00:28:36,507 --> 00:28:38,258
Transporter Room to Bridge.

537
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,177
We have the survivors on board.

538
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:42,137
Two women--

539
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,639
<i>an Ensign and a Lieutenant.</i>

540
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:45,849
<i>Dr. Bashir</i>
<i>is checking them now.</i>

541
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,881
That must have been

542
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:21,427
very uncomfortable,
Benjamin.

543
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:23,845
Look at that.

544
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,847
One of the tines is missing.

545
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,558
How did that happen?

546
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:28,850
Did you
break it off?

547
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:35,691
But why would you want
a small, thin piece of met...

548
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:41,530
Unless you needed a tool.

549
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:51,123
I see you've
been busy.

550
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:54,334
A little repair work

551
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,669
while I was gone.

552
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:58,756
Very thoughtful.

553
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,013
DAX:
Worf!

554
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:11,059
What is it?

555
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:14,647
I thought I picked up
another distress signal,
but now it's gone.

556
00:30:17,775 --> 00:30:20,360
You know, Benjamin,

557
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,070
I thought we had established

558
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,073
a level of trust
between us,

559
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,784
but I was wrong.

560
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,911
If there's
one thing

561
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,456
I can't abide, it's betrayal.

562
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:44,468
Our rescue efforts
have been delayed.

563
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:46,178
If we could just have
a few more hours.

564
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,680
(<i> static</i> ):
<i>The troop convoy</i>

565
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,014
<i>will be completely</i>
<i>unprotected...</i>

566
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,056
<i>when they... the plasma...</i>

567
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,933
<i>...strict radio silence.</i>

568
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,894
<i>...they can acknowledge</i>
<i>our signal even if...</i>

569
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:57,147
<i>...sorry, Worf,</i>
<i>but you're going to have...</i>

570
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:59,149
<i>your search and...</i>

571
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:01,109
I'm sorry, Captain.

572
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,069
There's some kind
of subspace interference

573
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,154
between us
and the station.

574
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:05,572
I'll keep trying.

575
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:08,158
I couldn't understand
a word Kira said.

576
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:09,868
Too much
interference.

577
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,745
It looks to me
like we're on our own.

578
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:14,373
I could understand
what she was trying to say.

579
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:15,791
What about
you, Chief?

580
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:16,916
Did you understand?

581
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:20,713
No, I couldn't understand
a word.

582
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:21,880
Well, it doesn't
really matter

583
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,465
what<i> we</i> think.

584
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:25,467
Commander Worf is Captain here.

585
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:30,764
We all know
what Major Kira's orders were.

586
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:33,225
It would be dishonorable
to ignore them.

587
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,602
You will forgive me...

588
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,937
if I don't consider
your honor...

589
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:40,524
to be worth
Captain Sisko's life.

590
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:42,942
You may leave the Bridge,
Doctor.

591
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:51,368
Helm.

592
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:53,203
Set a course
for the third planet.

593
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:54,705
Aye, Captain.

594
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:07,342
You brought it
on yourself, you know.

595
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,429
Just like all
your victims.

596
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:14,600
All my victims.

597
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,603
It always comes back
to that, doesn't it?

598
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:19,271
All my crimes.

599
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,147
I'm such a monster,

600
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:24,192
such an evil man.

601
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:29,114
Behold... Benjamin Sisko...

602
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:34,578
supreme arbiter of right
and wrong in the universe...

603
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:37,330
a man of such high
moral caliber

604
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,292
that he can sit
in judgment

605
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:42,377
on<i> all</i> the rest of us.

606
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,379
What the<i> hell</i> do you want
from me?!

607
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,924
My approval?

608
00:32:46,924 --> 00:32:49,593
Is that what this
is all about?

609
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,637
You want me to give you
my permission

610
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:53,472
to cause more suffering
and death?

611
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:55,307
Well, if that's
what you're after,

612
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,309
you might as well
pull out that phaser

613
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:58,811
and end this right now

614
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:00,687
because I will never
give it to you!

615
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:01,814
Good!

616
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:03,398
Good. I like this.

617
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,191
No more pretense.

618
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:07,026
No games.

619
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:10,614
Just you, me and the truth.

620
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:12,282
What do you know
about the truth?

621
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:15,034
You bend the truth
into whatever shape suits you.

622
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,954
(<i> laughs</i> )

623
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:20,123
Judge Sisko hands down
another ruling.

624
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,167
But where's his evidence?

625
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,711
All right.

626
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,463
You really want
to do this?

627
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:27,547
Here? Now?

628
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:28,590
Yes!

629
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,508
Okay.

630
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:32,302
Okay. Let's do it!

631
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:34,554
You were Prefect of Bajor
during the occupation.

632
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,681
True or false?

633
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:37,056
True.

634
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,475
And you were responsible
for everything

635
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:39,559
that happened
under your command.

636
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,560
True or false?

637
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,812
True.

638
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:43,605
So that means
that you are responsible

639
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:45,357
for the murder
of over five million Bajorans

640
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:46,316
on your watch.

641
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:48,109
True or false?!

642
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:51,237
False. I tried to<i> save lives</i>
during my administration.

643
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,280
Evidence?!

644
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,866
Evidence!

645
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:55,784
He wants evidence.

646
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:58,286
By the time I became Prefect,

647
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:01,414
the occupation had been going on
for almost 40 years

648
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:03,291
but the planet
still wasn't ready

649
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,168
for full-scale
colonization.

650
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:08,672
Central Command
wanted the situation resolved

651
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:11,591
and they didn't care
how it was done.

652
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:18,181
I was convinced
that a gentler hand

653
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:21,059
was required to deal
with the Bajorans.

654
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:25,605
It was a noble,
if misguided vision.

655
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:29,985
So in my first official
act as Prefect,

656
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:34,072
I ordered
all labor camp commanders

657
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:38,952
to reduce their output quotas
by 50 percent.

658
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:43,206
Then I reorganized
the camps themselves.

659
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,792
Child labor was abolished.

660
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,378
Medical care was improved.

661
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:50,964
Food rations were increased.

662
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:54,133
At the end of one month
of my administration,

663
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:58,096
the death rate had dropped
by 20 percent.

664
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:02,267
Now, how did the Bajorans
react to all this?

665
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:05,270
On my one-month anniversary,

666
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,065
they blew up
an orbital dry dock...

667
00:35:08,065 --> 00:35:13,987
killing over 200 Cardassian
soldiers and workers.

668
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:15,530
We didn't want
a reconciliation.

669
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,033
We wanted
to destroy you.

670
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:20,535
So I had to order a response.

671
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:21,912
But even then,

672
00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:26,207
it was
a carefully-tempered one.

673
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:30,587
I ordered 200 suspected members
of the resistance

674
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:33,548
rounded up and executed.

675
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:36,593
200 lives for 200 lives.

676
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:39,012
That's justice,
not malevolence.

677
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:40,013
<i>Justice.</i>

678
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:41,098
The Dominion
would have

679
00:35:41,098 --> 00:35:43,433
never been
so generous.

680
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:45,060
But did I give up

681
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,937
my efforts to reach out
to the Bajorans?

682
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:50,023
No. I tried again,

683
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:52,859
and what did I get
for my troubles?

684
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:57,155
An assassination attempt...
on my own station.

685
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:00,075
Another round of executions
followed--

686
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:04,412
once again, courtesy
of the Bajoran resistance.

687
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,081
We never
wanted peace.

688
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:07,373
We hated you.

689
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:08,875
We hated
all of you.

690
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,251
On and on it went,

691
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:13,797
year after
blood-soaked year.

692
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:16,382
Time and again,
I would reach out

693
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,717
with an open hand
of friendship,

694
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,260
and time and again

695
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,304
they would
slap it away.

696
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,515
The Bajorans understand
a clenched fist,

697
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,100
not an open hand.

698
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,226
Being reasonable
only made us bolder.

699
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:28,812
The Dominion
would have killed

700
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:30,897
every man, woman
and child on Bajor

701
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,273
long ago.

702
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,526
I hope you're
listening to
all this.

703
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:38,530
Oh, believe me...
you have my undivided attention.

704
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,950
Now, let me get this straight.

705
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,410
You're not responsible

706
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,163
for what happened
during the occupation,

707
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:47,413
the Bajorans are, hmm?

708
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:48,915
Yes.

709
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,167
Yes!

710
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:51,793
Exactly.

711
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:55,630
So, why do you
think they didn't

712
00:36:55,630 --> 00:37:00,010
appreciate this rare opportunity
you were offering them, hmm?

713
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,428
Oh, because...

714
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:07,017
they were blind, ignorant fools.

715
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:09,853
If only they had
cooperated with us,

716
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:13,065
we could have turned
their world into a paradise.

717
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:15,942
From the moment
we arrived on Bajor,

718
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:20,238
it was clear
that<i> we</i> were the superior race,

719
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,866
but they couldn't accept that.

720
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:25,451
They wanted
to be treated as equals

721
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:28,205
when they most certainly
were not.

722
00:37:28,205 --> 00:37:32,667
Militarily, technologically,
culturally--

723
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:37,839
we were almost a century
ahead of them in every way.

724
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,800
We did not choose to be
the superior race.

725
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,636
Fate handed us that role,

726
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:46,514
and it would have been
so much easier on everyone

727
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,474
if the Bajorans
had simply

728
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:49,809
accepted<i> their</i> role.

729
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:54,689
But, no...
day after day,

730
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:58,985
they clustered in their temples
and<i> prayed</i> for deliverance,

731
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:02,989
and night after night,
they planted<i> bombs</i>

732
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:05,117
outside of our homes.

733
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:06,993
Pride...

734
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:12,582
stubborn, unyielding pride.

735
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:17,587
From the servant girl
that cleaned my quarters,

736
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:19,380
to the condemned man

737
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,299
toiling
in a labor camp,

738
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:26,429
to the terrorist
skulking through the hills
of Dahkur Province...

739
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,142
they all wore their pride

740
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:35,354
like some...
twisted badge of honor.

741
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:38,233
And you hated them for it.

742
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:43,155
Of course I hated them!
I hated everything about them!

743
00:38:43,155 --> 00:38:46,908
Their superstitions
and their cries for sympathy,

744
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:49,119
their treachery and their lies,

745
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:54,124
their smug superiority
and their stiff-necked
obstinacy,

746
00:38:54,124 --> 00:38:57,794
their earrings and their
broken, wrinkled noses.

747
00:38:57,794 --> 00:38:59,963
You should have killed them all,
hmm?

748
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:00,922
Yes!

749
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:02,423
Yes!

750
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,425
That's right, isn't it?!

751
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,094
I knew it.

752
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:08,054
I've always known it.

753
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,807
I should have killed
every last one of them.

754
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:12,391
I should have
turned their planet

755
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:13,768
into a graveyard

756
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:18,356
the likes of which
the galaxy had never seen!

757
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:25,864
I should have killed them all.

758
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,324
(<i> Sisko yells</i> )

759
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:30,035
And that is why...

760
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:32,912
you're not an evil man.

761
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:30,887
(<i> yelling</i> )

762
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:32,764
(<i> both grunting</i> )

763
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,033
Do it!

764
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:03,544
(<i> yelling</i> )

765
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:09,259
I'm so glad we had
this time together, Benjamin

766
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:12,137
because we won't be seeing
each other for a while.

767
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:14,597
I have unfinished business
on Bajor.

768
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,515
They thought
I was their enemy.

769
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:19,978
They don't know what it is
to be my enemy, but they will.

770
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:21,729
From this day
forward,

771
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:24,983
Bajor is dead!

772
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:27,402
All of Bajor!

773
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:28,861
And this time,

774
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:31,572
even their Emissary
won't be able

775
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,574
to save them!

776
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,160
(<i> yelling</i> )

777
00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:40,039
(<i> groaning</i> )

778
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:03,104
It's time.

779
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:07,817
Plot a course
out of the system.

780
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:09,110
Full impulse.

781
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,903
Once we've cleared
the outer planets,

782
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:15,450
head for the rendezvous
coordinates... maximum warp.

783
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:18,036
Course laid in.

784
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:21,164
Engaging impulse engines.

785
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:22,707
(<i> console beeping</i> )

786
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:24,334
Captain,
I'm picking up a signal.

787
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:27,545
It's from Gul Dukat.

788
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:35,387
WORF:
<i>Ship's Log, Stardate 51413.6.</i>

789
00:42:35,387 --> 00:42:37,889
<i>We have rescued Captain Sisko,</i>

790
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:41,059
<i>but we did not have time</i>
<i>to locate Gul Dukat's shuttle.</i>

791
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:43,228
<i>We are now en route</i>
<i>to our rendezvous</i>

792
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:45,688
<i>with the troop convoy</i>
<i>near the Badlands</i>

793
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:48,274
<i>and the Captain</i>
<i>is recovering in Sick Bay.</i>

794
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:54,489
DAX:
Benjamin?

795
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:03,789
I've notified Starfleet
of Dukat's last known position.

796
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:04,957
They'll find him.

797
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:07,752
No, they won't.

798
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:10,880
You know, old man,

799
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,175
sometimes life seems
so complicated...

800
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:18,388
nothing is truly good
or truly evil.

801
00:43:18,388 --> 00:43:22,058
Everything seems to be
a shade of gray.

802
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:26,604
And then, you spend some time
with a man like Dukat,

803
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:32,860
and you realize that there is
such a thing as truly evil.

804
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:37,198
To realize that is one thing.

805
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:40,785
To do something about it
is another.

806
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:43,621
So, what are you going to do?

807
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,207
I'll tell you
what I'm not going to do.

808
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:49,461
I'm not going
to let him destroy Bajor.

809
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:52,671
I fear no evil.

810
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,468
From now on,

811
00:43:56,468 --> 00:43:58,344
it's him...

812
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:01,013
or me.
