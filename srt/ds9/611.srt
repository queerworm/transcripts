1
00:00:03,535 --> 00:00:07,948
Captain's Log, Stardate 51408.6.

2
00:00:07,983 --> 00:00:10,479
I've been aboard the <i>Honshu</i>
for two days now

3
00:00:10,524 --> 00:00:13,192
and I still
haven't spoken to him

4
00:00:13,266 --> 00:00:14,600
although the doctors
have assured me

5
00:00:14,637 --> 00:00:16,575
that he's made a full recovery.

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:18,377
Maybe that's
what I'm afraid of.

7
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:21,415
Maybe I prefer to think of him
as a crazy man...

8
00:00:21,459 --> 00:00:22,485
a broken man.

9
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:25,630
He'd be less dangerous that way.

10
00:00:25,672 --> 00:00:27,907
As terrible as it sounds

11
00:00:27,946 --> 00:00:30,385
there's a part of me
that wishes he were dead

12
00:00:30,421 --> 00:00:35,803
but that's a thought unworthy
of a Starfleet Officer.

13
00:00:37,143 --> 00:00:40,016
He lost an empire,
he lost his daughter

14
00:00:40,052 --> 00:00:41,717
and he nearly lost his mind.

15
00:00:41,757 --> 00:00:43,193
Whatever his crimes

16
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:47,106
isn't that enough punishment
for one lifetime?

17
00:00:53,361 --> 00:00:56,029
I heard you were aboard.

18
00:01:00,049 --> 00:01:03,457
I was wondering
if you'd make an appearance.

19
00:01:03,493 --> 00:01:05,693
How are you?

20
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:07,466
Better.

21
00:01:14,361 --> 00:01:19,709
The doctors tell me
I've made a remarkable recovery.

22
00:01:19,745 --> 00:01:21,341
They told me the same thing.

23
00:01:21,384 --> 00:01:22,854
Good.

24
00:01:22,888 --> 00:01:25,556
I'd hate to think
they were patronizing me.

25
00:01:27,068 --> 00:01:28,903
So I'm a war criminal.

26
00:01:28,941 --> 00:01:31,814
In the Federation, you're
innocent till proven guilty.

27
00:01:31,851 --> 00:01:33,412
So I'm told.

28
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,731
Do you believe I'm guilty,
Benjamin?

29
00:01:40,779 --> 00:01:43,914
I haven't seen...
all of the charges.

30
00:01:43,955 --> 00:01:46,292
It's not like you to equivocate.

31
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:47,856
I'm trying to be fair.

32
00:01:47,902 --> 00:01:50,398
You won't be tried
until the war is over.

33
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,848
Your appearance
before the special jury

34
00:01:52,884 --> 00:01:54,115
is just a formality.

35
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:58,100
And you'll be testifying
for the prosecution.

36
00:01:59,138 --> 00:02:02,045
I will tell them what I know.

37
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,915
Care to elaborate?

38
00:02:03,953 --> 00:02:06,017
Not really.

39
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,257
I see.

40
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:18,230
I never got a chance to tell you
how sorry I am about Ziyal.

41
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,948
Do I detect the fine hand
of Dr. Cox at work once again?

42
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:29,227
I told him I wanted
to offer my condolences.

43
00:02:32,544 --> 00:02:33,878
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:35,888 --> 00:02:37,883
The good doctor encourages me

45
00:02:37,928 --> 00:02:40,265
to talk about Ziyal
whenever possible

46
00:02:40,302 --> 00:02:41,567
since it was her...

47
00:02:44,249 --> 00:02:45,948
death

48
00:02:45,987 --> 00:02:50,559
that brought on
my momentary instability.

49
00:02:50,601 --> 00:02:52,938
I shouldn't be so suspicious.

50
00:02:53,946 --> 00:02:56,215
It's all right.

51
00:03:00,634 --> 00:03:02,869
Well...

52
00:03:02,908 --> 00:03:06,009
we should be arriving
at Starbase 621

53
00:03:06,051 --> 00:03:07,487
by noon tomorrow.

54
00:03:07,523 --> 00:03:09,792
I will see you
at the arraignment.

55
00:03:13,575 --> 00:03:14,566
Benjamin...

56
00:03:18,023 --> 00:03:21,592
about my daughter...

57
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:23,606
you and Major Kira

58
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,513
took care of her
for almost a year.

59
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:28,350
I wanted to thank you
for that.

60
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:29,985
It was very generous.

61
00:03:34,675 --> 00:03:36,111
Ziyal...

62
00:03:36,147 --> 00:03:39,317
was a very special young woman.

63
00:03:39,358 --> 00:03:42,459
It was a pleasure
to have her with us

64
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,031
even if it was
only a short time.

65
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,222
A short time
is all she ever had.

66
00:03:53,068 --> 00:03:55,439
Is there anything
I can get for you?

67
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:59,045
Hmm.

68
00:03:59,087 --> 00:04:00,580
A bottle of <i>kanar</i>

69
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:04,033
and an Orion slave girl
would be nice.

70
00:04:06,076 --> 00:04:08,048
I'll see what I can do.

71
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:14,099
Battle stations.

72
00:04:14,135 --> 00:04:17,407
Damage control teams
report to Level 5-J.

73
00:06:20,993 --> 00:06:22,658
It's confirmed.

74
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:25,903
USS <i>Honshu</i> was destroyed
this morning at 1030 hours

75
00:06:25,942 --> 00:06:28,781
by an attack wing
of Cardassian destroyers.

76
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:31,453
Starfleet has picked up
the distress beacons

77
00:06:31,493 --> 00:06:33,966
from three escape pods
and one shuttlecraft

78
00:06:34,002 --> 00:06:35,633
so there are survivors.

79
00:06:35,674 --> 00:06:38,274
The signals
are coming from this area.

80
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:41,119
The last reported position
of the <i>Honshu</i> was here

81
00:06:41,158 --> 00:06:43,792
which means there could
be survivors in any of these

82
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,269
adjacent star systems.

83
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:46,901
That's a pretty large area.

84
00:06:46,943 --> 00:06:48,470
How many ships
in the search party?

85
00:06:48,515 --> 00:06:51,491
Two... the <i>Constellation</i>
and the <i>Defiant.</i>

86
00:06:51,524 --> 00:06:53,051
Two? It could take days.

87
00:06:53,096 --> 00:06:56,197
With all the Dominion activity
along the border

88
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,676
it's all Starfleet
can spare at the moment

89
00:06:57,711 --> 00:07:01,348
and, the <i>Defiant</i> has
another appointment.

90
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:02,483
In 52 hours

91
00:07:02,527 --> 00:07:05,229
you need to be at this
rendezvous point

92
00:07:05,269 --> 00:07:07,640
outside the Badlands.

93
00:07:07,676 --> 00:07:10,675
You are the escort
for a Federation troop convoy.

94
00:07:10,719 --> 00:07:12,019
It will take 12 hours

95
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,184
just to arrive
at the coordinates

96
00:07:13,227 --> 00:07:14,321
where the <i>Honshu</i> was destroyed.

97
00:07:14,364 --> 00:07:16,268
And 12 more
to reach the Badlands, I know,

98
00:07:16,304 --> 00:07:18,573
but this convoy
is completely unprotected.

99
00:07:18,611 --> 00:07:20,583
They've been using
the plasma fields

100
00:07:20,617 --> 00:07:22,248
in the Badlands
to hide their movements

101
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:24,855
and when they emerge, they're
helpless without the <i>Defiant.</i>

102
00:07:24,898 --> 00:07:26,266
Can't they delay the convoy?

103
00:07:26,302 --> 00:07:28,434
I mean, if Captain
Sisko is still alive

104
00:07:28,475 --> 00:07:30,106
we have to give him
every chance.

105
00:07:30,147 --> 00:07:31,880
I raised
the same objection myself

106
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,551
and the orders still stand.

107
00:07:33,592 --> 00:07:36,065
Now, every minute spent

108
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,669
arguing here is one less minute
spent searching for the Captain.

109
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:41,706
Prepare
for immediate departure.

110
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,195
Worf...

111
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,603
there are over 30,000

112
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,806
Federation troops
in that convoy.

113
00:07:50,847 --> 00:07:53,116
You have 52 hours,
not one second longer.

114
00:07:53,155 --> 00:07:54,283
Understood?

115
00:07:54,325 --> 00:07:55,818
Understood.

116
00:07:58,872 --> 00:08:00,206
<i>Defiant.</i>

117
00:08:10,911 --> 00:08:14,411
Benjamin, can you hear me?

118
00:08:14,455 --> 00:08:15,925
Dukat?

119
00:08:15,961 --> 00:08:17,226
Yes.

120
00:08:17,265 --> 00:08:18,861
Everything's all right

121
00:08:18,903 --> 00:08:21,399
but don't try
to move too quickly.

122
00:08:21,445 --> 00:08:24,717
The left side of your body
is covered with plasma burns.

123
00:08:26,293 --> 00:08:27,889
We were in the brig

124
00:08:27,932 --> 00:08:30,098
and the ship went to Red Alert.

125
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:31,575
We were attacked

126
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:35,486
by a wing of Cardassian
ships, ironically.

127
00:08:35,523 --> 00:08:37,962
I was headed to Engineering.

128
00:08:37,997 --> 00:08:39,832
Well, you didn't get very far.

129
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,603
A plasma conduit exploded

130
00:08:41,642 --> 00:08:44,138
before you got 15 meters
down the corridor.

131
00:08:44,184 --> 00:08:47,125
That's where Lieutenant
McConnell and I found you

132
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,326
when the order came
to abandon ship.

133
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:50,837
Where's McConnell?

134
00:08:50,872 --> 00:08:52,342
Dead.

135
00:08:52,377 --> 00:08:55,410
A piece of shrapnel
hit him in the head

136
00:08:55,453 --> 00:08:59,158
just as we were carrying
you into the shuttle.

137
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:01,103
Any other survivors?

138
00:09:01,138 --> 00:09:03,772
I saw a few escape pods

139
00:09:03,814 --> 00:09:06,516
leaving the ship
just before it exploded

140
00:09:06,556 --> 00:09:08,391
but I had my hands full

141
00:09:08,428 --> 00:09:10,560
just trying to keep
us in one piece.

142
00:09:10,602 --> 00:09:15,812
The engines were damaged
from the shock waves

143
00:09:15,852 --> 00:09:18,486
and I set us down here

144
00:09:18,527 --> 00:09:20,830
wherever "here" is.

145
00:09:20,868 --> 00:09:22,031
But that shuttle's

146
00:09:22,072 --> 00:09:24,067
never going
to reach orbit again.

147
00:09:26,418 --> 00:09:30,591
The shuttle's distress
beacon was damaged...

148
00:09:33,107 --> 00:09:36,413
but I think
I managed to repair it.

149
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:40,292
So now all we have to do
is wait for someone to pick up

150
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,823
our signal.

151
00:09:41,868 --> 00:09:44,341
Whose signal
are you transmitting...

152
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:46,474
Starfleet or
the Dominion, hmm?

153
00:09:46,517 --> 00:09:49,652
It's a general distress call,
Benjamin.

154
00:09:49,693 --> 00:09:53,763
Whoever gets here first
will find one comrade-in-arms...

155
00:09:53,807 --> 00:09:55,438
and one prisoner.

156
00:09:55,478 --> 00:09:56,778
That's fair, isn't it?

157
00:09:56,849 --> 00:09:58,514
Fair enough.

158
00:10:00,527 --> 00:10:02,796
Did you do this?

159
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:05,399
You shattered most
of the bones in your arm.

160
00:10:05,443 --> 00:10:08,442
There was a bone regenerator
in the medkit

161
00:10:08,487 --> 00:10:11,223
but I'm afraid
I'm not much of a doctor

162
00:10:11,262 --> 00:10:13,063
so I just put on the cast.

163
00:10:13,101 --> 00:10:15,540
You did plenty.

164
00:10:15,575 --> 00:10:17,308
Thank you.

165
00:10:18,887 --> 00:10:20,448
We have enough field rations

166
00:10:20,491 --> 00:10:22,486
to last us a few weeks,
but I'd feel

167
00:10:22,532 --> 00:10:24,025
better, if I could locate

168
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,099
another source
of food and water.

169
00:10:27,614 --> 00:10:31,889
The surface is inhospitable,
to say the least

170
00:10:31,961 --> 00:10:35,700
but I did manage to find
some firewood and kindling

171
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,009
so there's a good chance
there's edible vegetation

172
00:10:38,048 --> 00:10:40,521
out there...
I just have to find it.

173
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,024
You could have left me behind.

174
00:10:44,067 --> 00:10:45,401
Why didn't you?

175
00:10:45,438 --> 00:10:47,137
I didn't want to.

176
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,145
I'll be back within the hour.

177
00:10:58,345 --> 00:11:00,511
What are you planning
to do with him?

178
00:11:00,553 --> 00:11:02,491
The Captain and I have
a lot to talk about.

179
00:11:02,525 --> 00:11:03,585
Such as?

180
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,099
It's of a personal nature.

181
00:11:05,134 --> 00:11:06,125
I see.

182
00:11:08,177 --> 00:11:09,944
You're going
to share your feelings

183
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,281
of loneliness and sorrow

184
00:11:11,321 --> 00:11:13,487
with your long-time adversary.

185
00:11:13,528 --> 00:11:14,964
Dr. Cox would be so proud.

186
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:16,595
Go away.

187
00:11:16,637 --> 00:11:18,906
You should kill him now
while you still can.

188
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:20,380
That won't be necessary.

189
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,251
He's in no condition
to challenge me.

190
00:11:22,289 --> 00:11:23,657
I can afford to be patient.

191
00:11:23,693 --> 00:11:24,662
You should kill him.

192
00:11:24,696 --> 00:11:26,395
I don't care for your tone!

193
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:27,928
Spare me your endless posturing.

194
00:11:27,973 --> 00:11:29,569
You're lucky
I speak to you at all

195
00:11:29,612 --> 00:11:32,679
after that pathetic display
back at the hospital.

196
00:11:32,722 --> 00:11:34,421
That's enough.

197
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,831
Oh, I see.
It's a sensitive topic.

198
00:11:36,869 --> 00:11:38,237
I wonder what Captain
Sisko would think

199
00:11:38,273 --> 00:11:40,040
if he'd seen you
curled up in a ball

200
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,552
crying yourself to sleep
every night.

201
00:11:42,586 --> 00:11:43,714
Stop it!

202
00:11:43,757 --> 00:11:47,201
I doubt he'd still have
the same respect for you

203
00:11:47,235 --> 00:11:50,268
if he'd heard you screaming
and screaming and screaming

204
00:11:50,311 --> 00:11:53,287
like a madman
till the nurses came

205
00:11:53,321 --> 00:11:55,385
and the doctors
had to sedate you.

206
00:11:56,631 --> 00:11:58,934
No!

207
00:12:17,234 --> 00:12:18,899
Is that breakfast?

208
00:12:20,077 --> 00:12:21,205
Possibly.

209
00:12:21,247 --> 00:12:22,216
Good morning.

210
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,378
Morning.

211
00:12:23,421 --> 00:12:25,416
What's it like outside?

212
00:12:25,528 --> 00:12:27,193
Oh, the wind has died down

213
00:12:27,233 --> 00:12:29,901
and the temperature
has gone up 20 degrees.

214
00:12:29,942 --> 00:12:31,344
I rather like it

215
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:33,283
but I think you'll
be more comfortable

216
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,756
in here where it's cooler.

217
00:12:36,496 --> 00:12:37,556
Too much.

218
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:41,973
I'm doing the cooking here,
thank you.

219
00:12:42,014 --> 00:12:42,983
Pardon me.

220
00:12:43,017 --> 00:12:44,453
You're not the only officer

221
00:12:44,488 --> 00:12:46,825
who learned how to cook,
you know.

222
00:12:46,862 --> 00:12:48,264
How are you feeling?

223
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:49,361
A little better.

224
00:12:49,404 --> 00:12:50,373
Good.

225
00:12:50,407 --> 00:12:51,398
After last night

226
00:12:51,443 --> 00:12:53,472
I was beginning to get worried.

227
00:12:53,517 --> 00:12:54,349
Last night?

228
00:12:55,891 --> 00:12:56,985
You don't remember?

229
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:02,075
Now that you mention it,
I remember waking up

230
00:13:02,111 --> 00:13:04,140
and I was feeling
a little dizzy.

231
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:06,680
You had a bout of nausea.

232
00:13:06,726 --> 00:13:09,496
Not exactly a little bout.

233
00:13:09,535 --> 00:13:10,629
Oh. I'm sorry.

234
00:13:10,672 --> 00:13:11,698
That's all right.

235
00:13:11,742 --> 00:13:15,516
I've had to clean up
a lot worse in my time.

236
00:13:15,621 --> 00:13:16,886
Once, when I was

237
00:13:16,925 --> 00:13:20,528
a newly minted glinn
on the <i>Kornaire</i>

238
00:13:20,603 --> 00:13:23,339
I had to help
clean out a compartment

239
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:27,381
where three men had gone through
an explosive decompression.

240
00:13:28,596 --> 00:13:31,731
I didn't sleep for a week
after that.

241
00:13:31,773 --> 00:13:33,802
Let's change the subject.

242
00:13:36,989 --> 00:13:39,555
The Emissary has spoken.

243
00:13:41,102 --> 00:13:43,200
Oh, come on, Benjamin.

244
00:13:43,242 --> 00:13:46,582
Have a sense of humor
about all this.

245
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,489
I'm not in much
of a joking mood.

246
00:13:48,526 --> 00:13:50,931
Well, that's a shame,
because there's so much

247
00:13:50,967 --> 00:13:53,533
to laugh about.

248
00:13:53,576 --> 00:13:55,514
You don't see it, do you?

249
00:13:55,548 --> 00:13:58,250
Benjamin, just a few hours ago

250
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,821
I was a prisoner
on my way to trial

251
00:14:00,866 --> 00:14:05,313
and you were my dear old friend
come to visit me in my cell.

252
00:14:06,684 --> 00:14:08,154
Now look at us.

253
00:14:08,189 --> 00:14:12,568
I'm free, and you're a prisoner
of your own battered body

254
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:14,769
and there's a good chance

255
00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:19,279
we'll be rescued
by the Dominion.

256
00:14:20,662 --> 00:14:22,634
You've got to laugh
at a universe

257
00:14:22,669 --> 00:14:27,481
that allows such radical shifts
in fortune, Benjamin.

258
00:14:27,517 --> 00:14:30,321
I will laugh when
a Federation starship arrives

259
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,127
and puts you back in a cell.

260
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,437
Whatever you say.

261
00:14:37,883 --> 00:14:39,285
What?

262
00:14:40,827 --> 00:14:42,560
Nothing.

263
00:14:42,598 --> 00:14:45,471
It's probably just the wind.

264
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:56,135
How is it?

265
00:14:56,175 --> 00:14:57,736
Needs salt.

266
00:14:57,781 --> 00:14:59,377
There's probably some

267
00:14:59,419 --> 00:15:01,448
in one of the ration packs.

268
00:15:04,034 --> 00:15:08,606
You know... we didn't get
much of a chance

269
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:10,952
to catch up before the attack.

270
00:15:10,989 --> 00:15:13,485
How is everybody
on what I'm sure

271
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:16,700
you're once again calling
Deep Space 9?

272
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,510
Odo and... Kira?
Quark?

273
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,678
They're all fine.

274
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,753
And, no, they don't miss you.

275
00:15:25,904 --> 00:15:27,431
Perhaps not.

276
00:15:27,475 --> 00:15:31,214
They never really did
give me much of a chance.

277
00:15:31,254 --> 00:15:34,789
They were too busy
plotting my downfall.

278
00:15:34,832 --> 00:15:36,393
Pepper.

279
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,279
If you only want me to tell you

280
00:15:40,316 --> 00:15:42,482
what you want to hear,
just say so.

281
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,872
Well, I hope
they at least told you

282
00:15:47,907 --> 00:15:49,879
that my policies
toward the Bajorans

283
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,679
were most generous this time.

284
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:54,660
They told me Weyoun didn't
give you much of a choice.

285
00:15:54,696 --> 00:15:58,367
Major Kira knows full well
I made every effort

286
00:15:58,407 --> 00:16:02,284
to heal the wounds
between Cardassia and Bajor.

287
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:04,451
Since the very beginning

288
00:16:04,493 --> 00:16:08,301
it was my intention to rectify
the mistakes of the past

289
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:11,440
and begin a new chapter
in our relations.

290
00:16:13,322 --> 00:16:15,727
Are you going
to put that in my soup?

291
00:16:16,732 --> 00:16:17,792
Oh.

292
00:16:23,621 --> 00:16:25,422
Well?

293
00:16:27,701 --> 00:16:29,297
Better.

294
00:16:32,683 --> 00:16:35,624
You're not going to give me
the benefit of the doubt

295
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,960
are you, Benjamin?

296
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:39,232
Do you really care what I think?

297
00:16:39,271 --> 00:16:42,212
Don't you care what your
old friends think of you?

298
00:16:42,247 --> 00:16:45,713
Dukat, we're not old friends.

299
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,894
You saved my life
and I'm grateful

300
00:16:48,935 --> 00:16:51,603
but that's as far as it goes.

301
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,191
You keep hearing something.

302
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:58,791
Are you sure
there's nothing out there?

303
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:01,974
It's just the wind.

304
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:03,241
I'm certain.

305
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:10,359
But I'm going to double-check,
just to make sure.

306
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,131
No.

307
00:17:19,165 --> 00:17:20,658
I won't do it... not yet.

308
00:17:20,704 --> 00:17:21,935
You're wasting time.

309
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,775
It's my time to waste, Damar.

310
00:17:23,813 --> 00:17:25,147
Remember your place.

311
00:17:25,184 --> 00:17:26,484
I mean no disrespect...

312
00:17:26,522 --> 00:17:28,927
you know that... but without you

313
00:17:28,963 --> 00:17:32,702
the war will be lost
and Cardassia will lie in ruins.

314
00:17:32,742 --> 00:17:34,407
Don't let this one man

315
00:17:34,447 --> 00:17:36,920
stand in the way
of your final triumph.

316
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:39,589
I have to know
that he respects me.

317
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,499
I think I've earned it.

318
00:17:41,536 --> 00:17:43,006
Of course you have.

319
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:44,673
He's just trying

320
00:17:44,713 --> 00:17:48,019
to deny you the satisfaction
of hearing him say it.

321
00:17:48,058 --> 00:17:51,695
You know in your heart
he secretly admires you.

322
00:17:51,736 --> 00:17:53,263
Isn't that enough?

323
00:17:53,307 --> 00:17:57,616
Kill him and be done with it.

324
00:18:13,304 --> 00:18:14,569
Think of it...

325
00:18:14,609 --> 00:18:17,448
the leader of Cardassia

326
00:18:17,484 --> 00:18:21,520
bringing the dead body
of the Emissary back

327
00:18:21,564 --> 00:18:22,727
to the Bajoran people.

328
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,170
They'll take it as a sign

329
00:18:24,206 --> 00:18:26,144
that the Prophets
have abandoned them.

330
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:28,414
The Shakaar government
will be overthrown

331
00:18:28,453 --> 00:18:31,429
and the Federation position
on Terok Nor

332
00:18:31,463 --> 00:18:33,298
will become untenable.

333
00:18:33,335 --> 00:18:35,535
Very tempting thought.

334
00:19:07,411 --> 00:19:09,349
You've made
some good points, Damar

335
00:19:09,383 --> 00:19:12,952
but there will be time
enough for all of that later.

336
00:19:13,965 --> 00:19:15,937
It's all right.

337
00:19:15,972 --> 00:19:19,176
I know you have
my best interests at heart.

338
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,026
I wanted to get
some water out of the kit.

339
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,130
Oh.

340
00:19:28,979 --> 00:19:30,039
Here.

341
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,109
Thanks.

342
00:19:31,153 --> 00:19:32,555
Oh...

343
00:19:32,591 --> 00:19:34,061
Anything out there?

344
00:19:34,095 --> 00:19:35,064
Hmm?

345
00:19:35,099 --> 00:19:36,730
Uh, no. No.

346
00:19:36,771 --> 00:19:40,648
Some rocks slid down the cliff.

347
00:19:40,684 --> 00:19:43,523
I think something's wrong
with the com system.

348
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,370
Oh?

349
00:19:47,405 --> 00:19:48,670
It was beeping a second ago.

350
00:19:48,709 --> 00:19:50,009
It might need recalibrating.

351
00:19:52,253 --> 00:19:53,723
I'll check.

352
00:19:56,133 --> 00:19:57,764
Well...

353
00:19:57,804 --> 00:19:59,138
everything's fine.

354
00:19:59,175 --> 00:20:01,375
The unit's still on line.

355
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,251
If you open up the casing

356
00:20:03,288 --> 00:20:06,161
you'll be able to run
a full diagnostic.

357
00:20:06,198 --> 00:20:07,897
Better safe than sorry.

358
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:10,168
You're right.

359
00:20:17,936 --> 00:20:18,996
Ah...

360
00:20:22,349 --> 00:20:23,980
Nothing to worry about.

361
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:26,393
It's working fine.

362
00:20:27,399 --> 00:20:29,234
That's all I wanted to know.

363
00:20:34,906 --> 00:20:37,175
Ship's Log, supplemental.

364
00:20:37,214 --> 00:20:40,384
We have picked up a total
of 12 <i>Honshu</i> survivors so far

365
00:20:40,424 --> 00:20:43,058
but there is still
no sign of Captain Sisko.

366
00:20:43,099 --> 00:20:44,569
We have less than 12 hours

367
00:20:44,604 --> 00:20:46,668
before we must
abandon the search.

368
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:23,825
Damn.

369
00:21:30,717 --> 00:21:33,385
Commander, I'm picking up
a distress signal.

370
00:21:53,223 --> 00:21:54,716
Good evening.

371
00:21:58,005 --> 00:21:59,738
Pleasant dreams, I hope.

372
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:02,308
I don't remember.

373
00:22:02,352 --> 00:22:04,484
Is it still dark out?

374
00:22:04,526 --> 00:22:09,303
I do apologize for bringing you
to such a gloomy latitude.

375
00:22:09,341 --> 00:22:11,610
The nights seem to last 18 hours

376
00:22:11,648 --> 00:22:13,347
the days less than five.

377
00:22:13,387 --> 00:22:14,880
Sit up.

378
00:22:19,908 --> 00:22:22,381
Well, looks like you're
planning a long stay.

379
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:23,716
Oh, no, not at all.

380
00:22:23,754 --> 00:22:27,391
Someone's bound to pick up
our signal any time now

381
00:22:27,432 --> 00:22:30,898
but I see no reason
why we shouldn't be comfortable

382
00:22:30,944 --> 00:22:32,414
in the meantime.

383
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,918
How's that?

384
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:35,423
That's just fine, thank you.

385
00:22:35,457 --> 00:22:36,950
Good.

386
00:22:47,496 --> 00:22:48,966
Ahh!

387
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:51,167
Much better, hmm?

388
00:22:54,285 --> 00:22:55,846
You know

389
00:22:55,889 --> 00:22:59,093
when I was out there
in the shuttle just now

390
00:22:59,133 --> 00:23:00,433
it occurred to me

391
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:03,172
that the Bajorans
would be very confused

392
00:23:03,213 --> 00:23:04,946
if they could see us here

393
00:23:04,985 --> 00:23:09,956
sharing the same food,
the same hardships.

394
00:23:10,001 --> 00:23:12,236
What do you think they would say
if they knew

395
00:23:12,275 --> 00:23:17,485
the Emissary of the Prophets
and the evil Gul Dukat

396
00:23:17,525 --> 00:23:21,698
were sitting here, together

397
00:23:21,739 --> 00:23:24,646
getting along
just like the two old friends

398
00:23:24,682 --> 00:23:26,175
that they really are?

399
00:23:30,566 --> 00:23:32,036
Oh...

400
00:23:32,072 --> 00:23:35,048
I... forgot.

401
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:38,547
You don't think of me
as your old friend

402
00:23:38,592 --> 00:23:40,153
do you, Benjamin?

403
00:23:40,198 --> 00:23:42,798
It's all right.

404
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:44,572
There's no one here.

405
00:23:44,611 --> 00:23:46,583
Just the two of us.

406
00:23:46,618 --> 00:23:49,091
No one to impress.

407
00:23:49,126 --> 00:23:52,934
No one to judge what you say.

408
00:23:52,972 --> 00:23:56,541
We can be honest
with each other.

409
00:23:56,584 --> 00:23:58,989
So tell me...

410
00:23:59,091 --> 00:24:02,933
what do you really think of me?

411
00:24:04,742 --> 00:24:06,577
I'll tell you what I think.

412
00:24:06,616 --> 00:24:08,714
I think you're
an evil, sadistic man

413
00:24:08,755 --> 00:24:11,959
who should have been tried
as a war criminal years ago...

414
00:24:12,067 --> 00:24:14,598
put up against a wall and shot.

415
00:24:17,584 --> 00:24:20,924
You probably agree
with Major Kira

416
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:22,626
don't you, Benjamin?

417
00:24:22,667 --> 00:24:25,267
I am the former Prefect
of Bajor...

418
00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:26,643
an evil man

419
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:30,249
who sent thousands of Bajorans
to their deaths

420
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:33,495
to satisfy his own
sadistic desires, hmm?

421
00:24:33,535 --> 00:24:35,872
Of course, he agrees with me

422
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:37,608
and it was millions.

423
00:24:37,648 --> 00:24:40,521
I don't think there's any point
in discussing this.

424
00:24:40,557 --> 00:24:42,529
I do.

425
00:24:42,563 --> 00:24:47,375
My name and reputation
have been slandered and twisted

426
00:24:47,412 --> 00:24:51,721
ever since the end
of the occupation of Bajor.

427
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,029
I have been vilified...

428
00:24:55,705 --> 00:24:58,681
by ignorant, small-minded people

429
00:24:58,715 --> 00:25:02,683
throughout the Quadrant
for the past six years.

430
00:25:02,728 --> 00:25:06,228
I just want to know
if you're one of them, Benjamin.

431
00:25:06,273 --> 00:25:09,579
I wasn't there
during the occupation.

432
00:25:09,617 --> 00:25:12,090
I didn't see all the things

433
00:25:12,124 --> 00:25:15,624
you had to struggle with
day after day.

434
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:18,702
I don't think
I can pass judgment.

435
00:25:18,746 --> 00:25:20,615
He just doesn't
want to anger you.

436
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:22,487
He really thinks
you're a vicious

437
00:25:22,524 --> 00:25:24,759
cold-blooded killer,
Dukat, and so do I.

438
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:28,341
I don't care what you think,
so I suggest

439
00:25:28,474 --> 00:25:30,538
you keep your opinions
to yourself.

440
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,003
I don't think

441
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:41,514
you're being entirely honest
with me, Benjamin.

442
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:44,685
You're not a man who hesitates
to make snap judgments

443
00:25:44,726 --> 00:25:46,698
when the situation calls for it.

444
00:25:46,732 --> 00:25:50,106
It's one of the signs
of a good commander.

445
00:25:50,144 --> 00:25:53,679
Now, I'm asking
for your opinion of me

446
00:25:53,722 --> 00:25:58,568
and I'd find it hard to believe
you don't have one.

447
00:25:58,604 --> 00:26:00,542
All right.

448
00:26:01,881 --> 00:26:04,515
I think you're right.

449
00:26:04,556 --> 00:26:07,087
You have been judged unfairly.

450
00:26:07,131 --> 00:26:09,366
I've judged you unfairly

451
00:26:09,405 --> 00:26:12,141
but I think you probably had

452
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,551
good reasons
for everything you did on Bajor.

453
00:26:14,588 --> 00:26:15,922
Yes.

454
00:26:15,959 --> 00:26:18,228
Yes. That's it, exactly.

455
00:26:18,267 --> 00:26:21,573
I had good reasons.

456
00:26:21,611 --> 00:26:24,381
Some of the harsher actions
I took

457
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,453
were forced on me
by Central Command.

458
00:26:27,496 --> 00:26:31,201
I wanted to use
entirely different tactics

459
00:26:31,241 --> 00:26:32,940
with the Bajorans.

460
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:36,218
I wanted to rule
with a softer hand

461
00:26:36,257 --> 00:26:39,996
but my superiors
didn't see it that way.

462
00:26:40,036 --> 00:26:43,012
You were a soldier, and you
had to carry out your orders.

463
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:44,640
Precisely.

464
00:26:51,372 --> 00:26:54,780
You are such a fool!

465
00:26:54,817 --> 00:26:56,287
Leave us alone!

466
00:26:56,321 --> 00:26:59,057
This doesn't concern you!

467
00:26:59,097 --> 00:27:00,966
He's patronizing you.

468
00:27:01,003 --> 00:27:02,303
"You were a soldier

469
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,278
and you had to carry out
your orders."

470
00:27:04,314 --> 00:27:06,149
He doesn't believe
that lame excuse

471
00:27:06,187 --> 00:27:07,657
any more than I do.

472
00:27:07,691 --> 00:27:09,252
This is growing tiresome.

473
00:27:09,297 --> 00:27:10,528
Dukat?

474
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:13,704
Dukat!

475
00:27:13,743 --> 00:27:15,339
I thought you wanted
to talk to me.

476
00:27:15,382 --> 00:27:17,047
Yes!

477
00:27:17,155 --> 00:27:19,959
But Nerys won't
leave well enough alone.

478
00:27:19,997 --> 00:27:24,067
She's always interfering,
always trying to upset me!

479
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:27,348
Maybe we should
just ignore her.

480
00:27:27,387 --> 00:27:32,164
Let's pretend that the Major's
not even here.

481
00:27:36,449 --> 00:27:39,584
I'm picking up two humanoid
life-forms on the surface.

482
00:27:39,626 --> 00:27:41,461
Bridge to Transporter Room.

483
00:27:41,499 --> 00:27:43,266
There's no reason to get upset.

484
00:27:43,305 --> 00:27:45,004
We're just talking.

485
00:27:45,044 --> 00:27:46,571
Two old soldiers

486
00:27:46,616 --> 00:27:48,987
talking around the campfire.

487
00:27:49,023 --> 00:27:51,292
I'm going to enjoy
watching this.

488
00:27:51,331 --> 00:27:53,303
He's going to beat you, Dukat.

489
00:27:53,337 --> 00:27:55,469
He's going to escape

490
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,949
and go back to DS9
and his friends

491
00:27:57,985 --> 00:28:00,824
and we're all going
to have a good, long laugh

492
00:28:00,861 --> 00:28:04,031
at your expense.

493
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:10,982
Enough!

494
00:28:25,305 --> 00:28:26,901
I've locked onto them.

495
00:28:35,906 --> 00:28:37,639
Transporter Room to Bridge.

496
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,777
We have the survivors on board.

497
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:41,551
Two women...

498
00:28:41,591 --> 00:28:43,222
an Ensign and a Lieutenant.

499
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,292
Dr. Bashir is checking them now.

500
00:29:15,968 --> 00:29:20,939
That must have been
very uncomfortable, Benjamin.

501
00:29:20,984 --> 00:29:23,287
Look at that.

502
00:29:23,324 --> 00:29:25,296
One of the tines is missing.

503
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,857
How did that happen?

504
00:29:26,903 --> 00:29:29,308
Did you break it off?

505
00:29:30,681 --> 00:29:35,185
But why would you want
a small, thin piece of met...

506
00:29:38,707 --> 00:29:41,774
Unless you needed a tool.

507
00:29:48,236 --> 00:29:50,539
I see you've been busy.

508
00:29:50,578 --> 00:29:58,023
A little repair work
while I was gone.

509
00:29:58,068 --> 00:30:00,371
Very thoughtful.

510
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:06,652
Worf!

511
00:30:09,137 --> 00:30:10,607
What is it?

512
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,115
I thought I picked up
another distress signal

513
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,746
but now it's gone.

514
00:30:17,163 --> 00:30:19,797
You know, Benjamin

515
00:30:19,838 --> 00:30:24,718
I thought we had established
a level of trust between us

516
00:30:24,754 --> 00:30:26,190
but I was wrong.

517
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:32,071
If there's one thing
I can't abide, it's betrayal.

518
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,654
Our rescue efforts
have been delayed.

519
00:30:42,697 --> 00:30:44,897
If we could just have
a few more hours.

520
00:30:44,938 --> 00:30:46,066
The troop convoy

521
00:30:46,109 --> 00:30:47,340
will be completely
unprotected...

522
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:48,472
when they... the plasma...

523
00:30:48,516 --> 00:30:50,215
...strict radio silence.

524
00:30:50,255 --> 00:30:52,227
...they can acknowledge
our signal

525
00:30:52,261 --> 00:30:53,230
even if...

526
00:30:53,264 --> 00:30:55,567
...sorry, Worf,
but you're going to have...

527
00:30:55,605 --> 00:30:56,733
your search and...

528
00:30:57,411 --> 00:30:59,383
I'm sorry, Captain.

529
00:30:59,418 --> 00:31:01,322
There's some kind
of subspace interference

530
00:31:01,357 --> 00:31:02,588
between us and the station.

531
00:31:02,628 --> 00:31:03,962
I'll keep trying.

532
00:31:03,999 --> 00:31:06,336
I couldn't understand
a word Kira said.

533
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,207
Too much interference.

534
00:31:08,246 --> 00:31:09,877
It looks to me
like we're on our own.

535
00:31:09,918 --> 00:31:12,586
I could understand
what she was trying to say.

536
00:31:12,627 --> 00:31:14,063
What about you, Chief?

537
00:31:14,098 --> 00:31:15,329
Did you understand?

538
00:31:17,073 --> 00:31:19,045
No, I couldn't understand
a word.

539
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,782
Well, it doesn't really matter
what we think.

540
00:31:21,822 --> 00:31:23,988
Commander Worf is Captain here.

541
00:31:26,838 --> 00:31:29,073
We all know
what Major Kira's orders were.

542
00:31:29,112 --> 00:31:31,415
It would dishonorable
to ignore them.

543
00:31:31,486 --> 00:31:33,823
You will forgive me...

544
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,333
if I don't consider
your honor...

545
00:31:36,369 --> 00:31:38,900
to be worth
Captain Sisko's life.

546
00:31:38,944 --> 00:31:41,417
You may leave the Bridge,
Doctor.

547
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:49,604
Helm.

548
00:31:49,645 --> 00:31:51,640
Set a course
for the third planet.

549
00:31:51,684 --> 00:31:53,211
Aye, Captain.

550
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:05,727
You brought it
on yourself, you know.

551
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,466
Just like all your victims.

552
00:32:10,578 --> 00:32:13,017
All my victims.

553
00:32:13,052 --> 00:32:15,993
It always comes back
to that, doesn't it?

554
00:32:16,029 --> 00:32:17,499
All my crimes.

555
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,595
I'm such a monster

556
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,479
such an evil man.

557
00:32:22,516 --> 00:32:27,430
Behold... Benjamin Sisko...

558
00:32:27,465 --> 00:32:32,779
supreme arbiter of right
and wrong in the universe...

559
00:32:32,816 --> 00:32:35,552
a man of such high
moral caliber

560
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:40,699
that he can sit in judgment
on all the rest of us.

561
00:32:40,741 --> 00:32:43,808
What the hell do you want
from me?!

562
00:32:43,851 --> 00:32:45,344
My approval?

563
00:32:45,389 --> 00:32:47,862
Is that what this is all about?

564
00:32:47,897 --> 00:32:49,892
You want me to give you
my permission

565
00:32:49,937 --> 00:32:51,806
to cause more suffering
and death?

566
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,611
Well, if that's
what you're after

567
00:32:53,683 --> 00:32:55,781
you might as well
pull out that phaser

568
00:32:55,822 --> 00:32:57,019
and end this right now

569
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,055
because I will never
give it to you!

570
00:32:59,099 --> 00:33:00,159
Good!

571
00:33:00,203 --> 00:33:01,799
Good. I like this.

572
00:33:01,841 --> 00:33:03,574
No more pretense.

573
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:05,312
No games.

574
00:33:05,353 --> 00:33:08,819
Just you, me and the truth.

575
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,597
What do you know
about the truth?

576
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:13,372
You bend the truth
into whatever shape suits you.

577
00:33:15,385 --> 00:33:18,486
Judge Sisko hands down
another ruling.

578
00:33:18,528 --> 00:33:20,626
But where's his evidence?

579
00:33:21,638 --> 00:33:23,165
All right.

580
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,874
You really want to do this?

581
00:33:24,915 --> 00:33:25,941
Here? Now?

582
00:33:25,985 --> 00:33:26,976
Yes!

583
00:33:27,022 --> 00:33:27,991
Okay.

584
00:33:28,025 --> 00:33:30,659
Okay. Let's do it!

585
00:33:30,701 --> 00:33:33,004
You were Prefect of Bajor
during the occupation.

586
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:34,101
True or false?

587
00:33:34,144 --> 00:33:35,444
True.

588
00:33:35,482 --> 00:33:36,884
And you were responsible
for everything

589
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,117
that happened
under your command.

590
00:33:38,157 --> 00:33:39,251
True or false?

591
00:33:39,295 --> 00:33:40,264
True.

592
00:33:40,298 --> 00:33:41,929
So that means
that you are responsible

593
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:43,908
for the murder
of over five million Bajorans

594
00:33:43,943 --> 00:33:44,969
on your watch.

595
00:33:45,013 --> 00:33:46,347
True or false?!

596
00:33:46,384 --> 00:33:49,884
False. I tried to save lives
during my administration.

597
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:50,726
Evidence?!

598
00:33:50,831 --> 00:33:52,267
Evidence!

599
00:33:52,302 --> 00:33:54,206
He wants evidence.

600
00:33:54,243 --> 00:33:56,648
By the time I became Prefect

601
00:33:56,684 --> 00:33:59,751
the occupation had been going on
for almost 40 years

602
00:33:59,794 --> 00:34:01,629
but the planet
still wasn't ready

603
00:34:01,666 --> 00:34:03,501
for full-scale colonization.

604
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:06,947
Central Command
wanted the situation resolved

605
00:34:06,982 --> 00:34:09,981
and they didn't care
how it was done.

606
00:34:13,269 --> 00:34:16,507
I was convinced
that a gentler hand

607
00:34:16,546 --> 00:34:19,419
was required to deal
with the Bajorans.

608
00:34:19,456 --> 00:34:23,960
It was a noble,
if misguided vision.

609
00:34:24,004 --> 00:34:29,249
So in my first official
act as Prefect

610
00:34:29,287 --> 00:34:32,457
I ordered
all labor camp commanders

611
00:34:32,497 --> 00:34:37,377
to reduce their output quotas
by 50 percent.

612
00:34:37,413 --> 00:34:41,586
Then I reorganized
the camps themselves.

613
00:34:41,627 --> 00:34:44,261
Child labor was abolished.

614
00:34:44,302 --> 00:34:46,741
Medical care was improved.

615
00:34:46,777 --> 00:34:49,445
Food rations were increased.

616
00:34:49,485 --> 00:34:52,518
At the end of one month
of my administration

617
00:34:52,562 --> 00:34:56,370
the death rate had dropped
by 20 percent.

618
00:34:56,407 --> 00:35:00,648
Now, how did the Bajorans
react to all this?

619
00:35:00,687 --> 00:35:03,663
On my one-month anniversary

620
00:35:03,697 --> 00:35:07,163
they blew up
an orbital dry dock...

621
00:35:07,209 --> 00:35:12,853
killing over 200 Cardassian
soldiers and workers.

622
00:35:12,893 --> 00:35:14,831
We didn't want a reconciliation.

623
00:35:14,866 --> 00:35:16,359
We wanted to destroy you.

624
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,776
So I had to order a response.

625
00:35:18,812 --> 00:35:23,988
But even then,
it was a carefully-tempered one.

626
00:35:25,266 --> 00:35:29,040
I ordered 200 suspected members
of the resistance

627
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:31,815
rounded up and executed.

628
00:35:31,854 --> 00:35:34,921
200 lives for 200 lives.

629
00:35:34,998 --> 00:35:38,133
That's justice, not malevolence.

630
00:35:38,174 --> 00:35:39,200
Justice.

631
00:35:39,244 --> 00:35:41,775
The Dominion would have
never been so generous.

632
00:35:41,819 --> 00:35:43,312
But did I give up

633
00:35:43,357 --> 00:35:45,853
my efforts to reach out
to the Bajorans?

634
00:35:45,899 --> 00:35:48,499
No. I tried again

635
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:51,846
and what did I get
for my troubles?

636
00:35:51,885 --> 00:35:55,990
An assassination attempt...
on my own station.

637
00:35:56,098 --> 00:35:59,005
Another round of executions
followed...

638
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,349
once again, courtesy
of the Bajoran resistance.

639
00:36:03,388 --> 00:36:05,053
We never wanted peace.

640
00:36:05,094 --> 00:36:06,325
We hated you.

641
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:07,698
We hated all of you.

642
00:36:07,735 --> 00:36:08,966
On and on it went

643
00:36:09,072 --> 00:36:12,675
year after blood-soaked year.

644
00:36:12,818 --> 00:36:14,687
Time and again,
I would reach out

645
00:36:14,724 --> 00:36:16,593
with an open hand
of friendship

646
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,261
and time and again

647
00:36:18,302 --> 00:36:20,001
they would slap it away.

648
00:36:20,108 --> 00:36:22,411
The Bajorans understand
a clenched fist

649
00:36:22,449 --> 00:36:23,919
not an open hand.

650
00:36:23,953 --> 00:36:26,017
Being reasonable
only made us bolder.

651
00:36:26,127 --> 00:36:27,758
The Dominion would have killed

652
00:36:27,799 --> 00:36:31,037
every man, woman and child
on Bajor long ago.

653
00:36:31,143 --> 00:36:33,275
I hope you're listening
to all this.

654
00:36:33,317 --> 00:36:37,456
Oh, believe me...
you have my undivided attention.

655
00:36:37,497 --> 00:36:40,837
Now, let me get this straight.

656
00:36:40,874 --> 00:36:43,245
You're not responsible

657
00:36:43,282 --> 00:36:44,981
for what happened
during the occupation

658
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,388
the Bajorans are, hmm?

659
00:36:46,425 --> 00:36:49,195
Yes. Yes!

660
00:36:49,235 --> 00:36:50,831
Exactly.

661
00:36:50,872 --> 00:36:54,372
So, why do you
think they didn't

662
00:36:54,417 --> 00:36:58,830
appreciate this rare opportunity
you were offering them, hmm?

663
00:36:58,865 --> 00:37:01,134
Oh, because...

664
00:37:01,206 --> 00:37:05,812
they were blind, ignorant fools.

665
00:37:05,854 --> 00:37:08,488
If only they had
cooperated with us

666
00:37:08,529 --> 00:37:11,869
we could have turned
their world into a paradise.

667
00:37:11,906 --> 00:37:14,813
From the moment
we arrived on Bajor

668
00:37:14,849 --> 00:37:19,022
it was clear
that we were the superior race

669
00:37:19,063 --> 00:37:21,536
but they couldn't accept that.

670
00:37:21,571 --> 00:37:24,137
They wanted
to be treated as equals

671
00:37:24,246 --> 00:37:27,050
when they most certainly
were not.

672
00:37:27,089 --> 00:37:31,729
Militarily, technologically,
culturally...

673
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:36,741
we were almost a century
ahead of them in every way.

674
00:37:36,786 --> 00:37:40,194
We did not choose to be
the superior race.

675
00:37:40,297 --> 00:37:42,361
Fate handed us that role

676
00:37:42,404 --> 00:37:45,208
and it would have been
so much easier on everyone

677
00:37:45,313 --> 00:37:50,125
if the Bajorans had simply
accepted their role.

678
00:37:50,162 --> 00:37:53,502
But, no...
day after day

679
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:57,919
they clustered in their temples
and prayed for deliverance

680
00:37:57,953 --> 00:38:01,864
and night after night,
they planted bombs

681
00:38:01,899 --> 00:38:03,894
outside of our homes.

682
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:06,004
Pride...

683
00:38:07,651 --> 00:38:11,493
stubborn, unyielding pride.

684
00:38:13,002 --> 00:38:16,468
From the servant girl
that cleaned my quarters

685
00:38:16,513 --> 00:38:20,390
to the condemned man
toiling in a labor camp

686
00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:21,827
to the terrorist

687
00:38:21,863 --> 00:38:25,705
skulking through the hills
of Dahkur Province...

688
00:38:27,247 --> 00:38:29,014
they all wore their pride

689
00:38:29,053 --> 00:38:34,161
like some...
twisted badge of honor.

690
00:38:34,202 --> 00:38:37,474
And you hated them for it.

691
00:38:37,513 --> 00:38:39,314
Of course I hated them!

692
00:38:39,385 --> 00:38:41,824
I hated everything about them!

693
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:45,565
Their superstitions
and their cries for sympathy

694
00:38:45,606 --> 00:38:48,079
their treachery and their lies

695
00:38:48,114 --> 00:38:52,960
their smug superiority
and their stiff-necked obstinacy

696
00:38:52,996 --> 00:38:57,237
their earrings and their
broken, wrinkled noses.

697
00:38:57,276 --> 00:38:59,511
You should have killed them all,
hmm?

698
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:01,955
Yes! Yes!

699
00:39:01,991 --> 00:39:03,860
That's right, isn't it?!

700
00:39:03,897 --> 00:39:05,630
I knew it.

701
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:07,335
I've always known it.

702
00:39:07,442 --> 00:39:10,212
I should have killed
every last one of them.

703
00:39:10,251 --> 00:39:13,250
I should have turned their
planet into a graveyard

704
00:39:13,294 --> 00:39:17,764
the likes of which
the galaxy had never seen!

705
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:25,228
I should have killed them all.

706
00:39:28,041 --> 00:39:29,375
And that is why...

707
00:39:29,412 --> 00:39:32,445
you're not an evil man.

708
00:40:48,802 --> 00:40:50,204
Do it!

709
00:41:03,549 --> 00:41:05,248
I'm so glad

710
00:41:05,288 --> 00:41:07,420
we had this time together,
Benjamin

711
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:10,264
because we won't be seeing
each other for a while.

712
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:12,641
I have unfinished business
on Bajor.

713
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,616
They thought I was their enemy.

714
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:18,116
They don't know what it is
to be my enemy, but they will.

715
00:41:18,162 --> 00:41:22,666
From this day forward,
Bajor is dead!

716
00:41:22,743 --> 00:41:25,684
All of Bajor!

717
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,951
And this time

718
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:31,562
even their Emissary
won't be able to save them!

719
00:41:59,393 --> 00:42:01,194
It's time.

720
00:42:03,439 --> 00:42:05,674
Plot a course out of the system.

721
00:42:05,713 --> 00:42:07,081
Full impulse.

722
00:42:07,118 --> 00:42:09,250
Once we've cleared
the outer planets

723
00:42:09,291 --> 00:42:13,327
head for the rendezvous
coordinates... maximum warp.

724
00:42:14,642 --> 00:42:16,010
Course laid in.

725
00:42:16,046 --> 00:42:19,147
Engaging impulse engines.

726
00:42:20,661 --> 00:42:22,257
Captain,
I'm picking up a signal.

727
00:42:23,938 --> 00:42:25,603
It's from Gul Dukat.

728
00:42:29,189 --> 00:42:33,328
Ship's Log, Stardate 51413.6.

729
00:42:33,368 --> 00:42:35,603
We have rescued Captain Sisko

730
00:42:35,642 --> 00:42:38,846
but we did not have time
to locate Gul Dukat's shuttle.

731
00:42:38,953 --> 00:42:41,051
We are now en route
to our rendezvous

732
00:42:41,093 --> 00:42:43,362
with the troop convoy
near the Badlands

733
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,170
and the Captain
is recovering in Sick Bay.

734
00:42:51,092 --> 00:42:52,585
Benjamin?

735
00:42:57,512 --> 00:43:01,651
I've notified Starfleet
of Dukat's last known position.

736
00:43:01,692 --> 00:43:03,026
They'll find him.

737
00:43:04,167 --> 00:43:05,798
No, they won't.

738
00:43:07,243 --> 00:43:08,679
You know, old man

739
00:43:08,715 --> 00:43:11,885
sometimes life seems
so complicated...

740
00:43:11,992 --> 00:43:16,097
nothing is truly good
or truly evil.

741
00:43:16,138 --> 00:43:19,638
Everything seems to be
a shade of gray.

742
00:43:19,683 --> 00:43:23,651
And then, you spend some time
with a man like Dukat

743
00:43:23,696 --> 00:43:31,746
and you realize that there is
such a thing as truly evil.

744
00:43:31,788 --> 00:43:34,923
To realize that is one thing.

745
00:43:34,965 --> 00:43:38,568
To do something about it
is another.

746
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:41,346
So, what are you going to do?

747
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:43,985
I'll tell you
what I'm not going to do.

748
00:43:44,027 --> 00:43:47,265
I'm not going
to let him destroy Bajor.

749
00:43:47,304 --> 00:43:51,443
I fear no evil.

750
00:43:52,621 --> 00:43:54,354
From now on

751
00:43:54,394 --> 00:43:56,229
it's him...

752
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:58,501
or me.
