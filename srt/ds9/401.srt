1
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:30,572
(<i> beeping</i> )

2
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,700
O'Brien to Sisko.
Go ahead.

3
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,828
We've swept all of Level 17.
No sign of the changeling.

4
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:36,787
Move down to 18.

5
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:38,372
We'll meet you there

6
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,499
after we finish checking
the guest quarters.

7
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:41,959
Watch yourself, Chief.

8
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:43,627
This changeling knows
the station as well as we do.

9
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,671
He could be anywhere...
or anything.

10
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:46,839
O'BRIEN:
Aye, Major.

11
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,726
We found him!

12
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:00,978
He's headed to the Promenade!

13
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:09,820
Just there.

14
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,618
All right, I want phaser sweeps
of everything on the Promenade.

15
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,161
He's here somewhere.
Let's find him.

16
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,329
On three.

17
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,415
One... two...

18
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,881
Bang. You're dead.

19
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:31,132
And so is Dr. Bashir.

20
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:34,929
Computer, elapsed time?

21
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:36,555
Three hours, 27 minutes.

22
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:38,306
That's not good enough.

23
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,684
If one of my people were loose
on the station for that long,

24
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:42,561
there's no telling how much
damage they could do.

25
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:44,063
Schedule another surprise drill.

26
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:45,689
If the Dominion tries
to infiltrate the station,

27
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:46,648
I want to be ready for them.

28
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,233
ODO:
And remind everyone

29
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,485
that next time, they'd
better sweep everything.

30
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,738
A changeling can be
anything-- a post, a pillar,

31
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:54,740
even a patch of
reflective surfacing.

32
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,950
We get the message,
Constable.

33
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,117
I hope so, Chief.

34
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,619
Just remember
that the Founders

35
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,454
are even better shape-
shifters than I am.

36
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:01,914
Excuse me.

37
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:03,874
If you're done
scaring my customers away,

38
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,292
I'd like to open the bar.

39
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,710
Go right ahead.

40
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,753
Thank you.

41
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:09,546
Constable...

42
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:12,132
it just occurred to me
that, if I knew in advance

43
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,634
just how long it will take

44
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,011
for them to catch you
during the next drill...

45
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,512
Well, let's just say

46
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:20,557
you and I could share
a substantial profit.

47
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,017
(<i> groaning</i> )

48
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:23,852
Think about it.

49
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,813
Performance reviews
will be held tomorrow

50
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,898
starting at 0800 hours
in the Wardroom.

51
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,942
Check your team leaders
for the schedule.

52
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:31,485
Dismissed.

53
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:33,946
(<i> sighing</i> )

54
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:34,947
How about some dinner?

55
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:36,031
Oh, not tonight.

56
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:37,616
I have a previous
engagement.

57
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:38,742
Oh, that's right--

58
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:39,910
Captain Yates got in
this morning.

59
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,078
Give her my regards.

60
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:43,204
I will.

61
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:52,798
(<i> door chimes</i> )

62
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:53,841
Come in.

63
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,554
Hello, Ben.

64
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,515
I hope I'm not too late.

65
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:06,520
Some things<i> are</i>
worth waiting for.

66
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,147
Oh...

67
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:10,357
Nice...

68
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:13,360
I'm glad you like it.

69
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,409
For you.

70
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,954
Isn't that a coincidence?

71
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,497
I have something
for you, too.

72
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:28,458
Uh...

73
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,839
Oh!

74
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:36,424
Where did you find
Tholian silk?

75
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:41,055
The Tholian Ambassador
owed me a favor.

76
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:42,890
May I?

77
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,183
It's... not silk,

78
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:45,767
but I-I think you'll like it.

79
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,311
(<i> laughing</i> )

80
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,271
It's from my brother's team.

81
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,399
The Pike City Pioneers.

82
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,985
My brother says if you're
ever on Cestus III,

83
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,196
he'll get you seats
in the dugout.

84
00:03:57,196 --> 00:03:58,572
How far is Cestus III?

85
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:02,617
Eight weeks, at maximum warp.

86
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,787
To see a real baseball game...

87
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,289
it might be worth the trip.

88
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:12,127
If you ever decide to go,
I'll take you there myself...

89
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,504
as long as you don't mind
traveling by freighter.

90
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,716
I just might take
you up on that.

91
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,510
Oh!

92
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,347
Did you do this all yourself?

93
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:30,062
Well, my father always says
the way to a woman's heart

94
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:31,813
is through her stomach.

95
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,274
So it's my

96
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,235
heart you're after.

97
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:37,945
I never could keep a secret.

98
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:41,198
In that case, uh,
maybe you could tell me

99
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:44,701
what all those maintenance crews
are doing in the docking ring.

100
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,995
Just some retrofitting.

101
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,539
Now you<i> are</i> keeping a secret.

102
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:54,669
Let's just say... we're
preparing a few surprises

103
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,256
just in case the Dominion
comes through the wormhole.

104
00:04:57,256 --> 00:05:00,592
It seems like everyone's
got the Dominion

105
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:02,719
on their minds these days.

106
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,388
I hear the Cardassians
have even sealed their borders.

107
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:10,769
What do you say we forget
about... business for a while?

108
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,897
I'd say that's a good idea.

109
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,737
(<i> beeping</i> )

110
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,114
Dax to Sisko.

111
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,242
Go ahead.

112
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,619
DAX: I think you'd better
get up here.

113
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,960
On my way.

114
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:41,049
I'll be back as...
soon as I can.

115
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,676
I know you will.

116
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,938
DAX:
Benjamin, take a look at this.

117
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,940
We've got
some unexpected company.

118
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,109
It's just de-cloaked.

119
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,568
Ah, the new Klingon flagship.

120
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,321
The<i> Negh'Var.</i>

121
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:05,240
There's a General Martok on
board asking to speak with you.

122
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,658
Put him through.

123
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:10,204
Captain Sisko,
I bring you greetings

124
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,998
from your allies
in the Klingon Empire.

125
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,125
Welcome to Deep Space 9,
General.

126
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,336
Is there something
I can do for you?

127
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:19,004
It has been a long journey.

128
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,547
My men require shore leave.

129
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,342
Certainly. They can come
aboard any time they like.

130
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:25,010
Good.

131
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,845
<i>Sowee TAH!</i>

132
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,940
(<i> muted conversations</i> )

133
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,370
Oh, Chief...

134
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,288
I'm beginning to think
there's no limit

135
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,664
to the wonders you can perform.

136
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,209
That's what I like
about you, Julian--

137
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,169
you're easily impressed.

138
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,170
(<i> chuckles</i> )

139
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,463
Thank you, Quark.

140
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:07,881
Can we get a
little<i> yamok</i> sauce

141
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:08,965
for these sand peas?

142
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,262
Quark?
Listen.

143
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,347
Do you hear that?

144
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,183
I don't hear a thing.

145
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:22,437
Exactly. The ambient noise level
in this room

146
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,481
is less than 30 decibels.

147
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:27,108
On an average day, it's 65.

148
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:30,153
When there are Klingons in the
room, it can go as high as 85.

149
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:33,865
So what you're trying
to say is... it's quiet in here.

150
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:36,034
<i>Too</i> quiet.

151
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,660
Something is terribly wrong.

152
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,661
(<i> whispers</i> ):
Well, like what?

153
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,288
I don't know,

154
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,291
but have you ever met
a<i> quiet</i> Klingon before?

155
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,626
Look how they're watching

156
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,170
the room.

157
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,130
It's like they're
picking out targets.

158
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:52,426
(<i> clears throat</i> )

159
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,761
Where are you going?

160
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,137
Well, I thought

161
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,514
I'd ask the Klingons
what they're up to.

162
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:58,557
Don't do that.

163
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:00,141
Why not?

164
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,893
Because I don't want them
to know we're onto them.

165
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:03,144
Well, suit yourself.

166
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:10,902
No, the secret is positioning
the pea correctly on the hand.

167
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:12,070
But I thought I had that.

168
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,738
What are you two doing?

169
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,199
I'm telling you, the Klingons
are up to something.

170
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,200
Calm down, Quark.

171
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,326
The Klingons are our allies.

172
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,827
They might be

173
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,955
<i>your</i> allies,
but they're not mine.

174
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,124
Relax. If there's something up
with the Klingons,

175
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,625
Captain Sisko will
find out about it.

176
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:30,589
Yeah, but will he tell<i> me?</i>

177
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,799
So, what brings
you here, General?

178
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,051
A valid question.

179
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,137
But first...

180
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,846
let us be sure
we are all

181
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,599
who we say we are.

182
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:52,110
You think we're changelings?

183
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,489
What I<i> think</i> doesn't matter.

184
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:56,656
The blood

185
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,283
will tell.

186
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:21,973
Hmm...

187
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:24,851
Now that that's over with...

188
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:30,689
We have been sent here to fight
alongside our Federation allies

189
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:32,484
against the Dominion.

190
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:33,692
I appreciate
your gesture,

191
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:35,820
but I'm not sure it's necessary.

192
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,948
The Klingon High Council
thinks it is.

193
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,284
Our communications relay
in the Gamma Quadrant

194
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:44,162
hasn't detected any signs
of Jem'Hadar activity

195
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:45,746
for quite some time.

196
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:48,082
They seem to be giving
the wormhole a wide berth.

197
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,084
They will come,

198
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:54,339
and when they do,
we will be ready for them.

199
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:05,808
(<i> laughing</i> )

200
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,352
DAX:
Oh, there you are.

201
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,728
We've been looking
all over for you.

202
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:12,440
Malko here just gave me
the most...

203
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,484
(<i> sighing</i> ):
amazing massage

204
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:17,529
and I'm sure, if you ask nicely,
he'll do the same for you.

205
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,531
No, thanks.

206
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,616
Why?

207
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:23,117
Because Malko's not real.

208
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,579
He's a puppet
made out of holographic light

209
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:26,954
and replicated matter.

210
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,665
Boys...

211
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,041
can you wait outside?

212
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,714
(<i> laughing</i> )

213
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:37,965
Are you afraid I hurt
their feelings?

214
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,676
Oh, you really
should try to get

215
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,469
into the spirit of things.

216
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,097
People come from all over Trill
to visit the Hoobishan Baths.

217
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,807
If I'm ever on Trill,
I'm sure I'll visit them,

218
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,727
but we're not on Trill,

219
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:50,729
and this isn't
the Hoobishan Baths.

220
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:53,231
It's a holosuite,
and none of it is real.

221
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:54,482
And?

222
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,484
"And"?

223
00:12:56,484 --> 00:13:00,196
I'm sorry. I feel silly.

224
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:03,283
Good! That's what
a holosuite's for--

225
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,825
to have a good time.

226
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:09,205
All you have to do is relax
and use your imagination.

227
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,959
I guess I don't have
much of an imagination.

228
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,087
Of course you do.
Everyone does.

229
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:20,091
Didn't you play make-believe
when you were a child?

230
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:22,552
Yeah. I used to make
believe the Cardassians

231
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,304
would stop killing the Bajorans

232
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,388
and just go away.

233
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:26,389
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

234
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:27,974
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

235
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:33,563
I... I guess I never had
much use for my imagination.

236
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:36,357
I mean, look at me.

237
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,485
You plan a fun evening for us,

238
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:42,322
and all I can do is sit here
and worry about Klingons.

239
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,324
You can worry
about the Klingons tomorrow.

240
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,743
From what I hear,
they're not going anywhere.

241
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:50,997
And as for your<i> underdeveloped</i>
imagination,

242
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:55,710
I prescribe
a strict regime of exercise

243
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,629
starting immediately.

244
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:01,341
All right.

245
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,343
I'll give it a try.

246
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,011
That's all I ask.

247
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:08,973
Come on. Malko couldn't
have gone far.

248
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:47,512
Fascinating. So both
the cup and the liquid

249
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:49,263
are merely extensions
of your body.

250
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,640
That is correct.

251
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,893
And if I want to, I can
even drink the liquid,

252
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,353
reabsorb it,

253
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:59,566
and produce new coffee
in the cup.

254
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,283
This way, I can give

255
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:12,412
the illusion that I'm sharing
the dining experience.

256
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,414
Very thoughtful.

257
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:22,505
Tell me, Odo, have you heard
any news from Cardassia lately?

258
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,758
Not since they sealed
their borders.

259
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:28,469
Well, I have, and frankly,
I don't like what I've heard--

260
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,513
rumors of uprising,
civil disturbance.

261
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,223
It's all very alarming.

262
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:36,352
I didn't know you still had
friends inside the Empire.

263
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,439
One or two, but I can't even
get through to them now.

264
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,981
That's what worries me.

265
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,902
With the destruction
of the Obsidian Order

266
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:45,986
and the threat of the Dominion,

267
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:49,407
these are unsettling times
for Cardassia.

268
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:50,825
They're unsettling
for everyone...

269
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:52,368
MALE:
Stop! What are
you doing here?

270
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,328
Let me see that!

271
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:57,081
But if I hear anything,
I'll let you know.

272
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,958
I'd appreciate that, Constable.

273
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,043
Excuse me for a moment.

274
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,630
KLINGON:
...so far away from
the Firelight Nebula.

275
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,466
So what is it that you
do on this station?

276
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,093
Can I help you?

277
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:12,806
<i>Lohd Zoss-lee chaw-KU</i>
<i>sohk jaTAL?</i>

278
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:15,600
Actually, I'm not sure
Constable Odo has a mother.

279
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,393
ODO:
Morn, I believe

280
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,604
Ensign Saunders
was looking for you.

281
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:22,398
Gentlemen, if you have
business on this Promenade,

282
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,900
I suggest you get on
with it.

283
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,735
I'd listen to him,
if I were you.

284
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:29,739
I don't take orders
from shape-shifters

285
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,492
or their Cardassian
lapdogs.

286
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,744
I may be a shape-shifter,
but I am also

287
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:36,746
Chief of Security
of this station,

288
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,038
so either move along

289
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,374
or you'll be continuing
this conversation

290
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,668
from inside
a holding cell.

291
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,252
(<i> growls</i> )

292
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:47,465
As long as you wear
that Bajoran uniform,

293
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:49,133
we're allies.

294
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,845
Make sure you never
take it off.

295
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,810
I didn't know
you spoke Klingon.

296
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:01,354
Oh, you'd be surprised at
the things you can learn

297
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,064
when you're doing
alterations.

298
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,956
Well, let me guess--

299
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,332
you're either lost

300
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:24,878
or desperately searching
for a good tailor.

301
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,337
Guess again!

302
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:28,464
(<i> grunts</i> )

303
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,266
I can't believe
you're not pressing charges.

304
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:42,562
Constable Odo and Captain Sisko
expressed a similar concern.

305
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,481
But really, Doctor,
there was no harm done.

306
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,316
They broke seven
of your transverse ribs

307
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,777
and fractured
your clavicle.

308
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,612
Ah, but I got off
several cutting remarks,

309
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:55,700
which no doubt did
serious damage to their egos.

310
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,743
Garak, this
isn't funny.

311
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:57,827
I'm serious, Doctor.

312
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,037
Thanks to your
ministrations,

313
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:01,039
I am almost
completely healed.

314
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,752
But the damage I did to
them will last a lifetime.

315
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,004
What I can't understand

316
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:11,841
is their inexplicable
hostility toward me.

317
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,760
Maligning Constable
Odo is one thing--

318
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,386
after all, he's a changeling.

319
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,972
The Klingons don't know
him as well as we do.

320
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:21,017
But relations between the
Klingon and Cardassian Empires

321
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:23,519
have never been
anything but amicable.

322
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,397
With the exception
of the Betreka Nebula Incident.

323
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:27,941
A minor skirmish.

324
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,526
It lasted 18 years.

325
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,236
It was ages ago.

326
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:36,991
Perhaps they decided
they just didn't like me.

327
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:38,117
Not like you?

328
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,452
Impossible.

329
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,120
You're right.

330
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,874
(<i> groaning</i> ):
As always, Doctor.

331
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,671
They must have mistaken me
for someone else.

332
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,173
The Klingon ships keep
cloaking and de-cloaking,

333
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,593
so it's impossible
to get an exact count,

334
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:58,262
but so far, we've been
able to identify

335
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,555
at least 20 different warships

336
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,307
in the vicinity
of the station.

337
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,059
DAX:
Captain, we're receiving

338
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,937
a priority one distress call
from the Freighter<i> Xhosa.</i>

339
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:07,229
Kasidy's ship?

340
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:10,149
She left the station
an hour ago.

341
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,026
Put her through.

342
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,656
This is the Freighter<i> Xhosa</i>
to Deep Space 9.

343
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,157
We're under attack by--

344
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:26,874
Her signal's been jammed.

345
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,626
Get a fix on her location.

346
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:30,586
Tell the crew on the<i> Defiant</i>
to man their stations.

347
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,421
We'll meet you on the Bridge.

348
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,007
<i>Defiant.</i>

349
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:42,181
Forward scanners
are detecting the<i> Xhosa</i>

350
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,976
at bearing 017 mark 346.

351
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:46,769
I'm picking up another ship.

352
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,938
It's got a tractor beam
on the<i> Xhosa.</i>

353
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,564
On screen.

354
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,069
A Klingon ship?

355
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,696
I can't get through to Kasidy.

356
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,698
They're still jamming
her communications.

357
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,658
Hail the Klingon vessel.

358
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:03,577
This is Commander Kaybok
of the<i> M'Char.</i>

359
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,245
What is it you want?

360
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,497
I want to know
why you stopped that ship.

361
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:08,290
KAYBOK:
We have orders

362
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,544
to search all vessels attempting
to leave Bajoran space.

363
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:12,586
Search them for what?

364
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,088
KAYBOK:
For shape-shifters.

365
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:16,507
Each ship will be scanned,
its cargo searched,

366
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:18,592
and its crew members
and passengers

367
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,636
subjected to genetic testing.

368
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,304
On whose authority?

369
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:25,432
On the authority of Gowron
and the Klingon High Council.

370
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,643
The Klingon High Council
has no jurisdiction

371
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,062
over ships in Bajoran space.

372
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:30,479
KAYBOK: We assumed

373
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,190
you would welcome
our assistance.

374
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,859
Do you have any evidence
that there are changelings

375
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,527
aboard this particular ship?

376
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:40,114
How can we have evidence
until we conduct our tests?

377
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:43,993
Commander, Bajoran law strictly
prohibits any unwarranted

378
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:47,205
search and seizure
of vessels in our territory.

379
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:49,373
I have my orders.

380
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,670
The Klingon ship has increased
power to its tractor beam.

381
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,131
It looks like they're preparing
to board the<i> Xhosa.</i>

382
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:59,926
Major, raise shields.

383
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,427
Power up the forward phasers.

384
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,930
See if that gets
their attention.

385
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:04,931
Shields up.

386
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:07,558
Forward phasers standing by.

387
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,853
They're still not releasing
the tractor beam.

388
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:16,525
Fire a warning shot 200 meters
off their starboard bow.

389
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,028
Yes, sir.

390
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,114
(<i> console beeping</i> )

391
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:23,199
Commander Kaybok would
like to speak with you.

392
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,825
Let's hear what
he has to say.

393
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,453
Captain, this is outrageous!

394
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:28,955
I agree.

395
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,664
But you leave me no choice.

396
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,208
You're violating Bajoran law.

397
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,128
Now, I will ask you
one last time.

398
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:37,088
Release that ship immediately.

399
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:38,464
We are your allies.

400
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:39,840
Major,

401
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,176
lock phasers
on<i> M'Char's</i> engines.

402
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:43,928
Prepare to fire on my command.

403
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:46,305
Phasers ready.

404
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,727
<i>K'trek im stram.</i>

405
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,520
Gowron will hear of this.

406
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:00,319
I'm receiving a hail
from the<i> Xhosa.</i>

407
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,988
It's Captain Yates.

408
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:03,656
Put her through.

409
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:06,993
Captain, I don't know
what you said

410
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,829
to those Klingons,
but it must have been good.

411
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,330
Is everyone all right?

412
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:15,584
<i>Everyone</i> is fine.

413
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:18,921
I'm glad to hear it.

414
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:22,549
We'll keep you on sensors
as long as we can,

415
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:26,344
but I doubt the Klingons
will give you any more trouble.

416
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:27,888
I appreciate that, Captain.

417
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,016
I'll see you in about two weeks.

418
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:31,976
You know where to find me.

419
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,655
According to our
long-range sensors,

420
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:46,699
the Klingon task force
has withdrawn

421
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,534
to just outside
Bajoran territory.

422
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,911
So now they're
in unclaimed space.

423
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:53,622
And if they decide
to continue
searching ships...

424
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,083
There's nothing
we can do about it.

425
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,627
Unless they try to stop
a Federation or Bajoran vessel.

426
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,254
Which so far,
they haven't done.

427
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:01,881
(<i> beeping</i> )

428
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:04,717
O'BRIEN: Captain, General
Martok is here to see you.

429
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:05,801
Send him in.

430
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:06,886
Yes, sir.

431
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:09,722
Ah, General.

432
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:10,931
We need to talk.

433
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,728
<i>SOHK-vad.</i>

434
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:30,784
It's Commander Kaybok's.

435
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,410
Why did he
give it to me?

436
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,956
He's letting you know
Kaybok's dead.

437
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:39,168
Martok probably had him
executed for disobeying orders.

438
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:42,671
Which means, our
next confrontation

439
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:46,884
with the Klingons won't
be resolved so easily.

440
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:49,762
Any suggestions, old man?

441
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:52,932
The longer the Klingons
are here,

442
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,934
the worse things
are going to get.

443
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:58,645
Whatever you decide to do,
you'd better do it soon.

444
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:02,775
Curzon told me once
that, in the long run,

445
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:06,279
the only people who can
really handle the Klingons

446
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,822
are Klingons.

447
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:12,576
Get me Starfleet Command.

448
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:39,770
O'BRIEN:
Commander Worf.

449
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,356
Chief. It has been
a long time.

450
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:43,357
Too long.

451
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:44,400
Welcome aboard.

452
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:47,820
Just what this station needs...

453
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,487
another Klingon.

454
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:50,530
Come on.

455
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,795
Lieutenant Commander Worf
reporting for duty, sir.

456
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:09,716
It's good to have you aboard,
Commander.

457
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,260
Thank you, sir.

458
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,053
At ease, Mr. Worf.

459
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:18,434
I was sorry to hear
about the<i> Enterprise.</i>

460
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,102
She was a good ship.

461
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:21,603
Yes, sir.

462
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:24,357
I understand you've been
on extended leave.

463
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:26,025
Yes, I have
been visiting

464
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:28,568
the Klingon monastery on Boreth.

465
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:30,363
I found my discussions
with the clerics there

466
00:25:30,363 --> 00:25:32,656
to be most enlightening.

467
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,241
Well, I hope you'll forgive me

468
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,909
for pulling you
away from your studies,

469
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:38,329
but I doubt that this assignment
will take very long.

470
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:40,373
My leave was almost over, sir.

471
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:43,625
Do you have any idea
where you'll be stationed next?

472
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:46,544
I am considering resigning
my commission.

473
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:47,838
Really?

474
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:50,049
May I ask why?

475
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:56,138
I have spent
most of my life among humans.

476
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:59,641
It has not always been
easy for me.

477
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:03,645
And since the destruction
of the<i> Enterprise,</i>

478
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:06,648
it has become
even more difficult.

479
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:10,110
I am no longer sure
I belong in this uniform.

480
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:18,576
Mr. Worf, if I told you
we didn't need you here,

481
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:22,039
I'd be lying,

482
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:25,000
but if you don't want to take
this assignment, I'd understand.

483
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,794
Thank you, sir,
but until I make my decision,

484
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,213
I intend to do my duty.

485
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:30,839
I'm glad to hear that.

486
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:34,301
I assume you've read
my situation report.

487
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,761
Yes, sir.

488
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,846
I can't help but feel
that General Martok

489
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:41,308
isn't telling the whole truth
about this Klingon task force.

490
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,476
There are too many

491
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:43,643
unanswered questions.

492
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:45,354
Then I will find you
some answers.

493
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:46,564
Good.

494
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:48,023
If you need any help,
let me know.

495
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,900
Yes, sir.

496
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,279
Commander.

497
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:59,577
I once thought about resigning
from Starfleet, too.

498
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:02,871
I know if I had,
I would have regretted it.

499
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,459
Don't make any quick decisions.

500
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:09,669
I will keep that in mind.

501
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,980
Let me guess--
Klingon bloodwine.

502
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,523
Prune juice, chilled.

503
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:31,442
(<i> laughing</i> ):
Prune juice?

504
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:33,986
I-If you say so.

505
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:43,287
O'BRIEN:
Commander, over here.

506
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:53,380
Dr. Julian Bashir,
Lieutenant Commander Worf.

507
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,090
Care for a game of darts?

508
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,634
I do not play games.

509
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:59,345
It's like poker,
but with pointed tips.

510
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:05,559
All right, think of it
as target practice.

511
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,603
The object is
to throw this dart

512
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:09,687
and hit that board
over there.

513
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:13,066
Aim for the dot
in the middle.

514
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,946
(<i> short-circuiting</i> )

515
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:21,908
KIRA:
Well, you saw how he was acting!

516
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,827
DAX:
I can't believe you did that!

517
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,663
Well, he didn't
leave me any choice.

518
00:28:25,663 --> 00:28:26,746
BASHIR:
Wait, wait, wait.

519
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:27,789
What did she do?

520
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,707
She knocked
out Lancelot.

521
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:30,959
He<i> kissed</i> me.

522
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,919
He's supposed
to kiss you.

523
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,254
But I was playing
a married woman.

524
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,631
BASHIR:
Uh, Lieutenant
Commander Worf--

525
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:38,925
this is Lieutenant
Commander Jadzia Dax

526
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,802
and Major Kira Nerys--

527
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:43,472
our First Officer.

528
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,393
Nice hat.

529
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,525
I, uh...

530
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:57,403
I don't usually dress like this.

531
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:00,614
We were in the holosuite.

532
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:01,990
So I gathered.

533
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:05,160
You used to be Curzon Dax.

534
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:09,081
That's right, and I don't
usually dress like this either.

535
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,291
Curzon's name is
an honored one

536
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,959
among my people.

537
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:15,629
<i>Louk, a jeek CHIM-ta law.</i>

538
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,595
I suppose so.

539
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:23,762
KLINGON:
Bartender!

540
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:24,763
(<i> pounding</i> )

541
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,515
Bloodwine!

542
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:27,766
And hurry!

543
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,771
Excuse me.

544
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,774
What did you say to him?

545
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,777
It loses something
in the translation.

546
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:42,573
This bloodwine is cold!

547
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:44,157
Get me another one!

548
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:48,746
You are Drex,
son of Martok.

549
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,791
That's right.

550
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,669
I am Worf, son of Mogh.

551
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,646
He's good.

552
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:15,897
What did I tell you?

553
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,124
(<i> sighing</i> )

554
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:35,875
(<i> doors chimes</i> )

555
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,586
Enter.

556
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,716
I have come
for my son's<i> d'k tahg.</i>

557
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:45,803
Give it to me...
or I will take it from you.

558
00:30:45,803 --> 00:30:49,139
Now that you are here...

559
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:54,102
I have no further need of it.

560
00:30:55,895 --> 00:31:00,776
You robbed my son of his honor
just to get my attention?

561
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:04,196
You cannot take away
what someone does not have.

562
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,864
You're saying my son
is without honor.

563
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,826
I am saying your son
is a coward and a liar.

564
00:31:08,826 --> 00:31:10,076
And what of his father?

565
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,497
That remains to be seen.

566
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:19,837
Tell me, what have I done
to earn your disrespect?

567
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:23,799
The misdeeds your troops have
committed speak for themselves--

568
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:26,885
attacking a Cardassian tailor,

569
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,763
detaining and searching ships
in neutral space without warning

570
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:31,348
or provocation...

571
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:35,227
and<i> you</i> executing
one of your Commanders

572
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:38,104
because he refused
to fire on a Federation ship.

573
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,606
Whatever we have done

574
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:42,192
is in the best interest
of the Alpha Quadrant.

575
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:44,986
You must think me a fool to make
your lies so transparent.

576
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,616
I do not wish to quarrel
with you, Worf.

577
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:51,869
Nor I with you.

578
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:54,913
The House of Martok
is an honored one

579
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,582
with a proud tradition,

580
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:58,709
but I must know
why you are here.

581
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:02,796
I am here under the authority
of Gowron himself.

582
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:04,882
I am carrying out his orders.

583
00:32:04,882 --> 00:32:06,675
That should be
all the explanation

584
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:08,134
a Klingon warrior needs.

585
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:12,556
You forget,
I am not only a Klingon warrior,

586
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:14,391
I am a Starfleet officer,

587
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:16,476
and Starfleet deserves
an explanation.

588
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:19,813
They will get one soon enough.

589
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:24,401
Until then, know this:

590
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:28,405
My mission will determine

591
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:30,741
the fate
of the Klingon Empire.

592
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:35,829
Interfere, and you risk
destroying us all.

593
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:57,225
(<i> door opens</i> )

594
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:06,860
You shouldn't drop
your left arm like that.

595
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,822
I do not remember
asking you for advice.

596
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:11,364
I'm just trying to help.

597
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:22,876
So, how did you
like the program?

598
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:25,086
I found it adequate,

599
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,755
although I was
surprised to find

600
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:30,049
a Klingon exercise program
on the holosuite.

601
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,050
It's mine.

602
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,845
You mean Curzon's.

603
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:34,680
No. I mean it's mine.

604
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,056
Computer,<i> bat'leth.</i>

605
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,144
I thought you might be tired
of fighting holograms.

606
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:43,355
It would not be
a fair match.

607
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:47,901
I'll go easy on you.

608
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:49,778
Very well.

609
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,949
Defend yourself.

610
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,712
I hope you're not holding back
because I'm a woman.

611
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:08,755
If it makes things any easier,
think of me as a man.

612
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,883
I've been one several times.

613
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,232
Feel better?

614
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:28,775
(<i> groans</i> )

615
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,276
I take it your conversation

616
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:32,612
with General Martok
didn't go all that well.

617
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:36,491
He was not forthcoming,
and he is not the only one.

618
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:38,827
I tried to contact

619
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:41,621
Gowron, Emperor Kahless,

620
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,206
even my brother,
who sits on the High Council.

621
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,791
No one will speak with me.

622
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,251
Maybe you're going
about this

623
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:47,293
the wrong way.

624
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:48,879
With so many Klingons around,

625
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,339
there must be someone
who owes your family a favor.

(<i> both yell</i> )

632
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:22,037
Your father and I
used to sing that song

633
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:25,040
when you were just a small boy.

634
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,544
Did I ever tell you how your
father saved my family's honor

635
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,923
during our blood feud
with the House of Duras?

636
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:34,382
Many times.

637
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,426
It is a<i> good</i> story.

638
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:38,553
Yes, and you tell it well.

639
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:41,431
Your father was a great warrior.

640
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:44,684
My family owes him
everything we have.

641
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:49,856
I wish there was some way
I could repay him.

642
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,235
There is.

643
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,863
Tell me why the task force
is here,

644
00:35:56,863 --> 00:36:00,283
the real reason, not the one
Martok gave the Federation.

645
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,619
The real reason?

646
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:06,790
I suppose you have
a right to know.

647
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,875
You are a Klingon warrior,

648
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:12,921
and it would be wrong
to keep you away from battle.

649
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:19,719
And it's going to be
a<i> glorious</i> battle.

650
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,054
(<i> laughing</i> )

651
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,068
ODO:
It all seems simpler

652
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:36,862
from up here,
doesn't it?

653
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:42,534
If you are looking
to start a conversation,

654
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:43,660
look somewhere else.

655
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,912
I would prefer to be left alone.

656
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:50,083
That may be, but you
can't stay up here forever.

657
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:53,419
Sooner or later, you're going to
have to talk to Captain Sisko.

658
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:56,255
Whatever it is you've found out
about the Klingons,

659
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,549
he should be the
first to know.

660
00:36:57,549 --> 00:37:00,760
You have been spying on me.

661
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,679
As Chief of Security,

662
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:06,599
it's my duty to observe
the inhabitants of this station.

663
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:11,437
Since your arrival,
you've transmitted an average

664
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,648
of five messages a day
to the Klingon Homeworld.

665
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,902
None of which has
gotten a response.

666
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:20,572
Then last night, you met

667
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:23,075
with a Klingon officer
in your quarters.

668
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:25,160
Since then, you haven't
sent a single message.

669
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,786
In fact, you've
done nothing

670
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,663
to further your investigation
of the Klingon task force.

671
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,916
None of which
is your business.

672
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:34,460
The security of this station
<i>is</i> my business.

673
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,880
Your behavior leads
me to conclude

674
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,799
that either you've given up
your investigation,

675
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:42,677
in which case,
it's my duty to take over,

676
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:45,847
or... you found something--

677
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:49,392
something so disturbing
that you're hesitant

678
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,936
to inform Captain Sisko.

679
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:58,443
I am not interested
in your... conclusions.

680
00:37:58,443 --> 00:37:59,652
Commander?

681
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,828
I just wanted to say
that I understand

682
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,747
what you're going through.

683
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:13,250
I've also had to choose
between duty

684
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,626
and loyalty to my people.

685
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:15,752
Yes. I've read

686
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:17,462
your Starfleet security file.

687
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:22,675
Frankly, Mr. Worf, I don't care
which choice you make,

688
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,928
but you owe it to Captain Sisko
to let him know

689
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:28,473
which side you're on,
before it's too late.

690
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:32,102
Enjoy the view.

691
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,699
Mr. Worf, what can I do for you?

692
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,410
Where is Captain Sisko?

693
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,621
I think he's
in a briefing session with--

694
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:53,915
I need to talk to him<i> now.</i>

695
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:55,416
Cardassia?

696
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:58,086
Why would the Klingons
want to invade Cardassia?

697
00:38:58,086 --> 00:38:59,671
According to my source,

698
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:02,174
there has been an uprising
on the Cardassian homeworld.

699
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:04,342
The Central Command
has been overthrown

700
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,678
and power transferred
to civilian authorities.

701
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:08,346
Even if your source is correct,

702
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,431
what does that have to do
with the Klingons?

703
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,809
Gowron and the High
Council believe the coup

704
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,102
was engineered
by the Dominion.

705
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:15,436
Do they have any proof?

706
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,272
None that I know of,
but they are convinced

707
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:18,606
that civilians could
not have overthrown

708
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,441
the Central Command
without help.

709
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:23,569
So, by attacking Cardassia,
they think they're protecting

710
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:25,697
the Alpha Quadrant
from the Dominion.

711
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:29,117
Sisko to Dax.

712
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:30,869
Contact General Martok.

713
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:33,163
Tell him I need
to meet with him immediately.

714
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:34,747
DAX: Yes, sir.

715
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:36,833
Hmm.

716
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:39,460
(<i> sighing</i> )

717
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:45,633
Mr. Worf, I know this hasn't
been an easy assignment for you.

718
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,677
No, it has not.

719
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:50,305
But I knew this day
would come again

720
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:51,890
when I'd be forced
to choose

721
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,433
between the Federation
and the Klingon Empire.

722
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:58,646
Maybe you don't have
to make that choice just yet.

723
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:01,900
I don't think there's any need

724
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,069
for you to be there
when I meet with Martok.

725
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:05,820
I would prefer to be there.

726
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,490
I cannot avoid responsibility
for what I have done today.

727
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:17,999
I must compliment you on your
intelligence network, Captain.

728
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:21,753
One day, you must tell me
<i>how</i> you learned of our plans.

729
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:23,129
General...!

730
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,964
How I got the information
isn't important.

731
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:28,009
I think it is,
and so will Gowron.

732
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:31,888
General, I want you to
call off this attack.

733
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:34,682
And what do you propose
we do instead?

734
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:38,686
Stand by and allow the Dominion
to take over the Alpha Quadrant?

735
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:41,731
You have no proof that there are
any Founders on Cardassia.

736
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:44,692
The change in government
is all the proof we need.

737
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,194
And what if you are wrong?

738
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:50,365
That would be unfortunate...
for the Cardassians.

739
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:54,327
General, the Federation Council
has made it clear to me

740
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:57,372
that they cannot support
your plans to attack Cardassia.

741
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,751
Are you saying the Federation
will sit back and do nothing

742
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:03,878
while Klingon soldiers
give their lives

743
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,671
to protect the Alpha Quadrant?

744
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,299
WORF:
Starfleet will
not participate

745
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:08,925
in an unprovoked invasion.

746
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:11,928
Then the victory
will be<i> ours</i> alone!

747
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:16,015
General, I would advise you
to reconsider.

748
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,768
The Federation Council
has informed Gowron

749
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:22,814
that if the attack goes forward,
it will jeopardize our treaty

750
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:25,817
with the
Klingon Empire.

751
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:31,697
Believe me, Captain, we have no
wish to antagonize your people.

752
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:34,242
Then call off the attack.

753
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,164
I will consult with Gowron.

754
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:42,041
You will have his decision
within the hour.

755
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:52,718
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

756
00:41:55,347 --> 00:41:57,056
(<i> sighs</i> )

757
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,146
DAX:
Captain, I think

758
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:04,605
you better take a look at this.

759
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,152
SISKO:
Report.

760
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:10,236
DAX: As soon
as General Martok

761
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:11,612
beamed back
to his ship,

762
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,948
he sent a message
to the Klingon fleet.

763
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:16,409
It was just one word--<i> "In'Cha."</i>

764
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:19,412
"Begin."

765
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:21,664
O'BRIEN:
I'm picking up
a huge distortion wave

766
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,041
in subspace.

767
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:25,043
The Klingon ships
are going to warp.

768
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:26,627
Can you plot their course?

769
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:27,920
Judging from the vector
on the subspace disturbance,

770
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,132
I'd say their heading is...
269

771
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:34,010
mark 032.

772
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:37,138
Straight
to the Cardassian Empire.

773
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:47,899
The Federation Council

774
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:49,942
has been trying
to contact Gowron.

775
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:52,195
So far they've had no response.

776
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:54,739
So until they've had a chance
to speak with him,

777
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:57,242
we've been ordered
not to get involved.

778
00:42:57,242 --> 00:42:58,993
KIRA:
The Bajoran government
has agreed

779
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:01,787
to abide by the decisions
of the Federation Council.

780
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:03,915
So that means we're not going
to warn the Cardassians?

781
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:05,833
DAX:
The Klingons are
still our allies.

782
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,961
If we warn the Cardassians,
we'd be betraying them.

783
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:11,881
Besides, what if the
Klingons are right?

784
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:13,216
What if the Dominion

785
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:15,427
has taken over the
Cardassian government?

786
00:43:15,427 --> 00:43:18,637
If my people wanted to seize
control of Cardassia,

787
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:20,681
that<i> is</i> how they would do it.

788
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:21,807
The coup could have happened

789
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:23,726
just as easily
without the Founders.

790
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,103
The Cardassian
dissident movement

791
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:26,687
has been gaining
strength for years.

792
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:28,314
With the Obsidian Order
out of the way,

793
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:30,567
they might have
finally succeeded.

794
00:43:30,567 --> 00:43:31,901
WORF:
The issue is not

795
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:34,904
if there are any Founders
on Cardassia.

796
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:36,239
There are many Klingons

797
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:38,241
who say we have been
at peace too long,

798
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:40,826
that the Empire must expand
in order to survive.

799
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:43,662
Fear of the Dominion
has given my people an excuse

800
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:45,248
to do what they were born
to do--

801
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:47,666
to fight and to conquer.

802
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:49,919
If they're so eager to fight,

803
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:51,463
who's to say they'll stop

804
00:43:51,463 --> 00:43:52,922
with the Cardassians?

805
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:55,300
Next target could be anyone,
even the Federation.

806
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,509
DAX:
If I were you,

807
00:43:56,509 --> 00:43:58,219
I'd be more worried about Bajor.

808
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,597
Think about it.

809
00:44:00,597 --> 00:44:02,474
What good would it do
the Klingons to defeat

810
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:04,976
Cardassia if they don't
control the wormhole?

811
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:06,644
Agreed.

812
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:10,731
If my people return to the
old ways, no one will be safe.

813
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:13,318
Then we'll have to make sure
that doesn't happen.

814
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:14,777
O'BRIEN:
But how?

815
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:17,530
The way I see it,
we only have two choices.

816
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,031
Both of them bad.

817
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,866
If we stand by and do nothing,

818
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:24,036
we run the risk of being
the Klingons' next target.

819
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:26,705
But if we disobey Starfleet
orders and warn the Cardassians,

820
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:29,542
we may end up starting
a war with the Klingons.

821
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:33,212
Which means...
we need a third option.

822
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:40,386
Trust me, you
won't regret this.

823
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:42,221
When it comes
to keeping warm,

824
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:44,098
nothing beats
Vitarian wool undergarments.

825
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:46,017
And in case you change your mind
about those earmuffs,

826
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:47,810
I'll keep them
on hold for you.

827
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:53,899
SISKO:
Mr. Garak, I'd like to see you
in the Wardroom immediately.

828
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:55,692
Bring your tailor's kit.

829
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,614
All together,
we're talking

830
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:01,324
about well over
a hundred ships

831
00:45:01,324 --> 00:45:02,659
just in the first wave.

832
00:45:02,659 --> 00:45:03,868
Excuse me.

833
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:05,328
I hope I'm not
interrupting.

834
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:06,996
I'd like to be measured
for a new suit.

835
00:45:06,996 --> 00:45:08,039
Now?

836
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:09,332
Right now.

837
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:10,791
But, Captain, I do have
your measurements.

838
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,126
Take them again.

839
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,919
You were saying, Commander?

840
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:16,381
I was saying that between
ground forces and warships,

841
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:18,049
the Klingons
have committed

842
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:21,260
almost a third of their
military to this invasion.

843
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,928
How long before they reach
their target?

844
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:25,931
According to our estimates,

845
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:27,350
the task force
should enter

846
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:28,643
Cardassian space
within the hour.

847
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:29,935
SISKO:
Don't forget
the waist.

848
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:32,021
I think I've lost
a little weight.

849
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:33,606
Well, thank you, Captain.

850
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:36,275
I believe
I have everything I need.

851
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:44,659
The Klingons?

852
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:47,078
Why would the Klingons
invade us?

853
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:49,997
According to my sources, the
Klingon High Council believes

854
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:52,417
that Cardassia has been
taken over by the Founders.

855
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:54,293
That's ridiculous.

856
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:55,878
Is it?

857
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:58,047
Garak, you have got
to talk to Sisko.

858
00:45:58,047 --> 00:46:01,842
Tell him he has to find some way
to stop the Klingons.

859
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:04,554
Cardassia has enough
problems right now.

860
00:46:04,554 --> 00:46:07,640
Having trouble
keeping the civilians in line?

861
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,142
How do<i> you</i> know about that?

862
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:12,604
I'm afraid that since the fall
of the Obsidian Order,

863
00:46:12,604 --> 00:46:15,940
Cardassian security
isn't what it used to be.

864
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,942
Yes.

865
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:20,319
Shame about the Order.

866
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:24,115
I suppose there won't be
much demand

867
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:26,783
for your services anymore.

868
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:29,746
Looks like you'll be
hemming women's dresses

869
00:46:29,746 --> 00:46:32,123
for the rest of your life.

870
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:34,459
We can stand here all day
reminding ourselves

871
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:36,210
just how much
we hate each other,

872
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,630
but<i> you</i> don't have the time.

873
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:40,965
The Klingon fleet will reach
Cardassian territory

874
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:43,718
in less than one hour.

875
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:45,553
I suggest you prepare for them.

876
00:46:52,602 --> 00:46:54,562
KIRA:
Based on Klingon
transmissions,

877
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:57,690
we've intercepted,
the outlying Cardassian colonies

878
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:00,109
were overrun almost immediately.

879
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:02,695
But now that the Cardassian
fleet has mobilized,

880
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:04,656
the Klingons are meeting
stronger resistance.

881
00:47:04,656 --> 00:47:05,990
You'd almost think
somebody warned

882
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:07,408
the Cardassians
they were coming.

883
00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:09,285
Hopefully, it'll make
the Klingons

884
00:47:09,285 --> 00:47:11,036
think twice
about what they're doing.

885
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:12,871
Unlikely, Major.

886
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:15,249
Now that the battle has begun,
Martok and his troops

887
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,251
will settle for nothing
less than victory.

888
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:24,550
(<i> sighs</i> )

889
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:25,842
O'BRIEN:
Well...

890
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:27,637
what did the Federation
Council say?

891
00:47:27,637 --> 00:47:30,973
They've decided to condemn
the Klingon invasion.

892
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:34,602
In response...
Gowron has expelled

893
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:37,355
all Federation citizens
from the Klingon Empire

894
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:38,606
and recalled

895
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:41,025
his Ambassadors
from the Federation.

896
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:43,152
You're saying he cut off
diplomatic relations?

897
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:45,530
He's done more than that.

898
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:50,159
The Klingons have withdrawn
from the Khitomer Accords.

899
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:52,995
The peace treaty
between the Federation

900
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:54,622
and the Klingon Empire

901
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:56,081
has ended.

902
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,208
O'BRIEN:
Captain.

903
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:00,085
You're never going
to believe this.

904
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:02,254
A Klingon ship
just de-cloaked

905
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:03,673
off Upper Pylon 3

906
00:48:03,673 --> 00:48:05,842
and is requesting
permission to dock.

907
00:48:05,842 --> 00:48:09,512
They claim they have
Chancellor Gowron on board,

908
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:12,264
and he is demanding
to speak with Mr. Worf...

909
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:13,974
personally.

910
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:24,901
Chancellor Gowron.

911
00:48:24,901 --> 00:48:26,612
You wished
to speak with me?

912
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:28,573
Worf.

913
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:31,992
Worf!

914
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:34,119
It is good to see you.

915
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:35,329
I always said that uniform

916
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:36,997
would get you into
trouble one day.

917
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:40,084
It seems you were right,

918
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:41,627
but I do not apologize for my--

919
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:43,838
Yes, yes, I know.

920
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:45,964
You did what you thought
was right.

921
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:48,467
And even though you may
have made some enemies,

922
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:51,262
I assure you, ha,
I am not one of them.

923
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:53,514
I am glad.

924
00:48:53,514 --> 00:48:55,057
Your friendship
means much to me.

925
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:56,642
And yours to me.

926
00:48:56,642 --> 00:49:00,605
It has been too long since
you last fought at my side.

927
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:03,315
Now the time
has come again.

928
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:06,861
We will do great deeds
in the coming days.

929
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:09,946
Deeds worthy of song!

930
00:49:09,946 --> 00:49:13,242
You want me to go
to Cardassia with you?

931
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:15,912
What better way
to redeem yourself

932
00:49:15,912 --> 00:49:17,914
in the eyes of your people?

933
00:49:17,914 --> 00:49:20,040
Come with me, Worf.

934
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,542
Glory awaits you

935
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:23,711
on Cardassia.

936
00:49:32,637 --> 00:49:36,223
Worf, why do you stand there
like a mute<i> d'blok?</i>

937
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,309
I have offered you
a chance for glory.

938
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:39,894
All you have to do is take it.

939
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:42,814
If there's any glory
to be won, Gowron,

940
00:49:42,814 --> 00:49:44,732
it'll have to be yours alone.

941
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:46,983
I cannot come with you.

942
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:49,153
Of course you can.

943
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:51,280
It is where you belong.

944
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,325
I cannot abandon my post.

945
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:55,992
You no longer have a post.

946
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:57,453
You have no place
on that station

947
00:49:57,453 --> 00:49:59,246
and no business
wearing that uniform.

948
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:01,081
I have sworn
an oath of allegiance.

949
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:02,207
To the Federation!

950
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:03,292
You would
have me

951
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:04,335
break my word?

952
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:05,962
Your word?

953
00:50:05,962 --> 00:50:07,588
What good is your word

954
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:09,757
when you give it to people
who care nothing for honor?

955
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:11,342
Who refuse to lift a finger

956
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:14,679
while Klingon warriors
shed blood for their protection?

957
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:17,431
I tell you,
they are without honor,

958
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:20,768
and you do not
owe them anything!

959
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:22,895
It is not what I owe them
that matters.

960
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:24,355
It is what I owe myself.

961
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:26,899
Worf, son of Mogh,
does not break his word.

962
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:28,943
And what of your debt to me?

963
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:30,736
Are you saying
you owe me nothing?

964
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:32,822
I gave you back your name,
restored your house,

965
00:50:32,822 --> 00:50:34,949
gave your family a seat
on the High Council,

966
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:36,492
and this is how you repay me?

967
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:37,535
It is true.

968
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:39,077
I owe you a great debt.

969
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:42,665
I would give up my life for you.

970
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:45,710
But invading Cardassia is wrong,
and I cannot support it.

971
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:49,338
Worf... I have
always considered you

972
00:50:49,338 --> 00:50:51,423
a friend and an ally.

973
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:54,010
And because you
are my friend,

974
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:59,515
I am giving you this one
last chance to redeem yourself.

975
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:01,642
Come with me.

976
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:05,021
I cannot.

977
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:09,233
Think about what
you are doing.

978
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:12,194
If you turn your
back on me now,

979
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:14,154
for as long as I live,

980
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:15,740
you will not be welcome

981
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:18,158
anywhere in the
Klingon Empire.

982
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:20,703
Your family
will be removed

983
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:23,414
from the High Council,
your lands seized,

984
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:26,417
and your House
stripped of its titles!

985
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:28,335
You will have nothing!

986
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:34,008
Except my honor.

987
00:51:36,928 --> 00:51:38,930
So be it.

988
00:51:49,899 --> 00:51:52,902
(<i> loud conversation</i>
<i>and laughter</i> )

989
00:51:52,902 --> 00:51:53,819
MALE:
Dabo!

990
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:54,987
ALL:
Dabo!

991
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:12,046
You look like you could
use some company.

992
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:24,558
Chief, do you remember the time

993
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,978
we rescued Captain Picard
from the Borg?

994
00:52:26,978 --> 00:52:29,145
How could I forget?

995
00:52:29,145 --> 00:52:31,941
It was touch and go there
for a while.

996
00:52:31,941 --> 00:52:33,943
There were a couple of moments

997
00:52:33,943 --> 00:52:37,529
when I thought we were all going
to wind up being "assimilated."

998
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:39,865
Well, I never doubted
the outcome.

999
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:42,952
We were like... warriors
from the ancient sagas.

1000
00:52:42,952 --> 00:52:45,370
There was nothing
we could not do.

1001
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:47,915
Except keep the holodecks
working right.

1002
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:58,592
I... have decided
to resign from Starfleet.

1003
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,970
Resign?

1004
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:02,847
What are you talking about?

1005
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,723
I have made up my mind.

1006
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:06,224
It is for the best.

1007
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:09,895
Look, I-I know how much
you miss the<i> Enterprise,</i>

1008
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:13,273
but I'm sure they'll be
building a new one soon.

1009
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,026
It will not be the same.

1010
00:53:15,026 --> 00:53:16,944
The<i> Enterprise</i> I knew is gone.

1011
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:20,280
Now those were good years.

1012
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,867
But now it is time
for me to move on.

1013
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:24,035
And do what?

1014
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:30,791
I do not know.

1015
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:32,668
I thought I would be returning
to Boreth,

1016
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:35,420
but now that is impossible.

1017
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,213
I have made an enemy of Gowron

1018
00:53:37,213 --> 00:53:39,508
and every other Klingon
in the Empire.

1019
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:42,469
All the more reason
to stay in Starfleet.

1020
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,972
This uniform will only serve
to remind me

1021
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:48,642
of how I have disgraced myself
in the eyes of my people.

1022
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:53,772
I suppose I could get a berth
on a Nyberrite Alliance cruiser.

1023
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:56,775
They are always eager to hire
experienced officers.

1024
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:58,485
The Nyberrite Alliance?

1025
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:00,863
That's a long way.

1026
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:02,489
And what about your son?

1027
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:05,534
Alexander is much happier

1028
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:07,745
living with his grandparents
on Earth

1029
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:09,663
than he ever was
staying with me.

1030
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:12,124
And one thing is certain...

1031
00:54:12,124 --> 00:54:14,668
the sooner I leave here,
the better.

1032
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:16,712
My continued presence
on Deep Space 9

1033
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:18,839
would only be a liability
to Captain Sisko

1034
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:20,799
in his dealings
with the Klingons.

1035
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,509
Do you hear
that, Chief?

1036
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:25,846
72 decibels.
Music to my ears.

1037
00:54:25,846 --> 00:54:26,931
I think I
liked it better

1038
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:28,099
when it was quiet.

1039
00:54:28,099 --> 00:54:30,559
You want quiet,
go to the Replimat.

1040
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:33,395
This is Quark's
the way Quark's should be,

1041
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:35,231
the way it was meant to be.

1042
00:54:35,231 --> 00:54:37,024
Am I glad
we finally got rid

1043
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:38,525
of all those Klingons.

1044
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:42,362
Uh... present company
excepted, of course.

1045
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:50,829
I got to hand it
to you, Quark.

1046
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,372
You really know
how to make

1047
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:54,166
your customers
feel welcome.

1048
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:57,211
What do I care?

1049
00:54:57,211 --> 00:54:59,546
All he ever drinks
is prune juice.

1050
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:01,173
I'm sorry, Mr. Worf,

1051
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:04,969
but I can't accept your
resignation at this time.

1052
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:08,013
I do not understand.

1053
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:10,099
What further use
could I be here?

1054
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:11,725
I'm not sure yet.

1055
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:13,894
But as long
as the fighting continues

1056
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:15,938
between the Klingons
and the Cardassians,

1057
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:17,982
I need you here on the station.

1058
00:55:19,984 --> 00:55:22,402
If you think that is wise.

1059
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:23,695
(<i> chuckles</i> )

1060
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:26,782
I don't know
if it's wise or not.

1061
00:55:26,782 --> 00:55:29,034
But I do know
that you're a good officer,

1062
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:32,288
and right now, I need
every good officer I can get.

1063
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:36,875
Captain, we just got word
from Bajoran Intelligence.

1064
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:39,586
The Klingons have broken through
the Cardassian fleet.

1065
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:42,756
How long before they reach
Cardassia Prime?

1066
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:44,424
52 hours.

1067
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:47,052
If the Klingon Empire has
reverted to the old practices,

1068
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:48,846
they will occupy
the Cardassian homeworld,

1069
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:50,472
execute all
government officials,

1070
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:52,850
and install
an Imperial Overseer

1071
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:55,269
to put down
any further resistance.

1072
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:58,897
I think it's about time we had
a talk with the Cardassians.

1073
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:01,150
Captain, I'm a little busy
at the moment,

1074
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:04,153
so whatever you have to say,
please make it brief.

1075
00:56:04,153 --> 00:56:05,904
Dukat?

1076
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:08,573
I was trying to reach someone
in the civilian government.

1077
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:10,284
And you have succeeded.

1078
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:13,287
You are speaking to the new
Chief Military Advisor

1079
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:14,288
to the Detapa Council.

1080
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:15,747
Does this mean

1081
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:17,958
you've turned
your back on Central Command?

1082
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:21,795
It means that as a loyal officer
of the Cardassian military,

1083
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:23,172
I am pledged to serve

1084
00:56:23,172 --> 00:56:25,924
the legitimate ruling body
of the Empire,

1085
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:27,592
whoever that may be.

1086
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:31,013
In other words, you saw
which way the wind was blowing

1087
00:56:31,013 --> 00:56:32,388
and switched sides.

1088
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:34,766
It seemed like a good idea
at the time.

1089
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:37,936
Dukat, you have got to get
those council members to safety

1090
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:40,564
before the Klingons
reach Cardassia Prime.

1091
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:43,192
I am open to suggestions,
Captain.

1092
00:56:43,192 --> 00:56:44,693
If you can get a ship

1093
00:56:44,693 --> 00:56:46,778
and meet me at
these coordinates,

1094
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:48,072
I'll do what I can

1095
00:56:48,072 --> 00:56:50,366
to escort you
out of the war zone.

1096
00:56:50,366 --> 00:56:53,994
That is a very generous offer.

1097
00:56:53,994 --> 00:56:56,830
I must say I am touched.

1098
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,666
By saving the members
of the Detapa Council

1099
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,377
you will be saving some very...

1100
00:57:01,377 --> 00:57:02,711
Forget the
speech, Dukat.

1101
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:04,462
Just meet me
at the rendezvous point.

1102
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:06,422
And if the Klingons
try to stop us?

1103
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:08,550
Then I'll be there
to reason with them.

1104
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,969
I doubt the Klingons
will fire on a Federation ship.

1105
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:13,889
I'm not sure I share
your optimism.

1106
00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:17,601
But, then, I don't have
much choice, do I?

1107
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:19,353
We'll meet you there.

1108
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:24,316
WORF:
Sir...

1109
00:57:24,316 --> 00:57:25,901
if the Klingons are right--

1110
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:27,236
if the Cardassian government

1111
00:57:27,236 --> 00:57:28,946
has been taken over
by the Founders--

1112
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:30,614
Then we'll be helping
them to escape.

1113
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:32,657
That's the chance
we'll have to take.

1114
00:57:35,911 --> 00:57:38,789
I know you want to be
out of that uniform,

1115
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:41,666
but right now,
I need you with me.

1116
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:44,711
I understand.

1117
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:50,426
Make sure the Chief
double-checks

1118
00:57:50,426 --> 00:57:51,385
all our new systems.

1119
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:52,677
We may need them.

1120
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:54,054
I'll tell him,
but knowing the Chief,

1121
00:57:54,054 --> 00:57:55,513
he's probably
doing it already.

1122
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:57,015
Keep the station
on Yellow Alert.

1123
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:58,600
And just to be
on the safe side,

1124
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,978
I'd recommend that you send

1125
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:03,439
some of the civilian population
down to Bajor.

1126
00:58:03,439 --> 00:58:05,399
I was planning to.

1127
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:07,901
I wish I was
going with you.

1128
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:08,902
So do I.

1129
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:11,155
But I need you here.

1130
00:58:14,783 --> 00:58:15,993
Ben!

1131
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:19,997
I'm, uh... glad
I caught you

1132
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:21,206
before you left.

1133
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:22,249
So am I.

1134
00:58:22,249 --> 00:58:23,334
When'd you get back?

1135
00:58:23,334 --> 00:58:25,085
Uh, less than an hour ago.

1136
00:58:25,085 --> 00:58:29,714
Jake told me you were
about to go off on...

1137
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:31,133
some kind of mission.

1138
00:58:31,133 --> 00:58:33,844
The<i> Defiant</i> leaves
in a few minutes.

1139
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:36,388
And you can't tell me
about it.

1140
00:58:36,388 --> 00:58:39,266
I'll be back in
four or five days.

1141
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:43,354
I'm leaving tomorrow.

1142
00:58:43,354 --> 00:58:45,189
Phew!

1143
00:58:45,189 --> 00:58:48,484
I guess our timing
hasn't been too good.

1144
00:58:48,484 --> 00:58:49,776
No.

1145
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:51,611
No, it's been terrible.

1146
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:55,449
I'm not even sure
when I'll be back.

1147
00:58:57,826 --> 00:58:59,703
Make it soon.

1148
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:24,811
Don't get killed.

1149
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:27,064
I'll do my best.

1150
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:48,085
Activate the cloaking device.

1151
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:49,711
Cloaking device
is functioning

1152
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:50,962
within normal
parameters.

1153
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:54,591
Set a course
for the rendezvous point.

1154
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:55,633
Maximum warp.

1155
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:57,677
Course laid in.

1156
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,012
Engage.

1157
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:00,305
Mr. Worf,

1158
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:02,224
keep an eye out
for Klingon ships

1159
01:00:02,224 --> 01:00:03,475
cloaked
or otherwise.

1160
01:00:03,475 --> 01:00:05,352
Aye, sir.

1161
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:10,566
Is something wrong,
Mr. Worf?

1162
01:00:10,566 --> 01:00:13,151
No, sir.

1163
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:15,195
Yes, sir.

1164
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:16,821
It is just...

1165
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:18,865
I have never been
on a Federation starship

1166
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:20,284
that had a cloaking device.

1167
01:00:20,284 --> 01:00:23,203
It is... a little strange.

1168
01:00:24,496 --> 01:00:26,039
You'll get used to it.

1169
01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:32,463
Sir, I hate to bring this up,

1170
01:00:32,463 --> 01:00:34,005
but our agreement
with the Romulans

1171
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:35,799
expressly prohibits use
of the cloaking device

1172
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:37,050
in the Alpha Quadrant.

1173
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,676
You're right, it does.

1174
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:40,596
But there are hundreds
of Klingon ships

1175
01:00:40,596 --> 01:00:42,180
between us and Dukat,

1176
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:45,434
and I intend to make
that rendezvous in one piece.

1177
01:00:45,434 --> 01:00:48,186
Well, I won't tell the Romulans
if you don't.

1178
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:58,905
I never thought I'd say this,

1179
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:04,244
but right now...
I'm glad the Dominion's around.

1180
01:01:04,244 --> 01:01:06,871
Otherwise, we never would have
started these upgrades,

1181
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:09,791
let alone have them
almost finished by now.

1182
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:11,709
Well, there's something to be
said for incentive.

1183
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:13,003
Uh-huh.

1184
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:14,921
I just hope everything
works okay.

1185
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:17,299
You're saying
you're not sure?

1186
01:01:17,299 --> 01:01:18,425
The way I see it

1187
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:20,511
there are two
possibilities.

1188
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:22,262
Either everything
will be fine, or...

1189
01:01:22,262 --> 01:01:23,721
Or?

1190
01:01:23,721 --> 01:01:26,891
Or we'll end up blowing
the station to pieces.

1191
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:28,685
Oh.

1192
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,895
Well, let's hope
we don't have to find out.

1193
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:32,147
(<i> chuckling</i> )

1194
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:35,442
WORF:
Captain...

1195
01:01:35,442 --> 01:01:37,735
I am detecting some debris.

1196
01:01:37,735 --> 01:01:41,573
Bearing 025 mark 319.

1197
01:01:41,573 --> 01:01:44,075
Commander, drop us
to one-quarter impulse.

1198
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:46,036
Aye, Captain.

1199
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:47,579
It appears to be the wreckage

1200
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:49,623
of a number
of Cardassian vessels.

1201
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:50,957
On screen.

1202
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:55,295
BASHIR:
Are there any signs

1203
01:01:55,295 --> 01:01:56,754
of survivors?

1204
01:01:56,754 --> 01:01:59,007
I suppose it's possible.

1205
01:01:59,007 --> 01:02:01,092
But there's no way to know
without de-cloaking

1206
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:03,011
and using our primary
sensor array.

1207
01:02:03,011 --> 01:02:05,889
Sir, I strongly recommend
against that.

1208
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:08,308
It is likely there are
cloaked Klingon warships

1209
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:09,809
in the vicinity lying in wait.

1210
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:12,437
Well, that doesn't sound
very honorable to me.

1211
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:16,149
In war, there is nothing
more honorable than victory.

1212
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:22,656
Commander, keep us
at one-quarter impulse...

1213
01:02:22,656 --> 01:02:25,116
until we've cleared
the wreckage.

1214
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:26,826
Then take us to warp.

1215
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:29,871
But, sir...
if there<i> are</i> survivors...

1216
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:31,873
I'm sorry, Doctor,
we can't risk it.

1217
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:33,584
We have to reach Dukat.

1218
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:37,879
And double-check the
secondary power grid.

1219
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:39,005
It's still
not performing

1220
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:40,257
as well as
it should.

1221
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:41,383
Yes, sir.

1222
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:46,513
What's our status?

1223
01:02:46,513 --> 01:02:48,682
We're approaching
the rendezvous point.

1224
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:52,352
Captain, I am detecting
weapons fire ahead.

1225
01:02:52,352 --> 01:02:54,938
It appears to be three
Klingon birds-of-prey

1226
01:02:54,938 --> 01:02:56,814
attacking a Cardassian vessel.

1227
01:02:56,814 --> 01:02:58,400
The vessel is badly damaged.

1228
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,402
Captain, I'm picking up
a distress signal

1229
01:03:00,402 --> 01:03:01,403
from Dukat, audio only.

1230
01:03:01,403 --> 01:03:02,654
Put it through.

1231
01:03:02,654 --> 01:03:04,322
(staticky<i> ):</i>
This is Gul Dukat

1232
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:05,657
of the Cruiser<i> Prakesh.</i>

1233
01:03:05,657 --> 01:03:07,033
We're under heavy fire.

1234
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:08,577
Our shields are failing.

1235
01:03:08,577 --> 01:03:11,037
I don't know how much longer
we can hold out.

1236
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:13,331
Send reinforcements immediately.

1237
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:14,958
I repeat, this is--

1238
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:16,334
We're in visual range.

1239
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:18,128
On screen.

1240
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:19,921
Maximum magnification.

1241
01:03:22,633 --> 01:03:25,552
Two decades of peace
with the Klingons,

1242
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:27,304
and it all comes down to this.

1243
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:30,265
WORF:
Orders, Captain.

1244
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:36,521
DAX:
Benjamin...

1245
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:39,775
Dukat's ship isn't going
to last much longer.

1246
01:03:43,654 --> 01:03:45,656
Arm quantum torpedoes...

1247
01:03:45,656 --> 01:03:49,993
drop the cloak,
and raise shields.

1248
01:03:49,993 --> 01:03:51,620
We're going in.

1249
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:04,841
Red Alert.

1250
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:06,176
Doctor.

1251
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:08,679
Commander Worf, transmit
a priority one signal

1252
01:04:08,679 --> 01:04:09,887
to the Klingon ship.

1253
01:04:09,887 --> 01:04:11,723
Tell them to break off
their attack

1254
01:04:11,723 --> 01:04:13,558
and stand down immediately.

1255
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,102
Message sent.

1256
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:17,729
Captain, I find it
highly unlikely

1257
01:04:17,729 --> 01:04:20,732
that the Klingons
will heed your...

1258
01:04:20,732 --> 01:04:22,900
We've been fired upon
by the lead bird-of-prey.

1259
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:23,860
Shields are holding.

1260
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,070
I see your point, Mr. Worf.

1261
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:29,658
Let's show them
what they're up against.

1262
01:04:29,658 --> 01:04:32,118
Attack pattern omega.
Target their engines.

1263
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:40,627
(<i> console beeping</i> )

1264
01:04:40,627 --> 01:04:42,671
Incoming message from
the Cardassian ship.

1265
01:04:42,671 --> 01:04:44,214
Put it through.

1266
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:50,637
DUKAT: I must
compliment you, Captain.

1267
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:53,682
You're nearly Cardassian
in your punctuality.

1268
01:04:53,682 --> 01:04:55,517
Fire phasers!

1269
01:04:55,517 --> 01:04:57,101
Dukat, power up your engines

1270
01:04:57,101 --> 01:04:59,020
and prepare to follow us
back to DS9.

1271
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:01,606
An excellent suggestion,,
Captain,

1272
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:04,275
assuming
we had any engines left.

1273
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:05,569
What's your status?

1274
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:10,114
Our engines are gone,
our shields are down,

1275
01:05:10,114 --> 01:05:12,116
and we have no weapons
to speak of.

1276
01:05:12,116 --> 01:05:13,660
Prepare to evacuate.

1277
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:15,036
We'll start to beam you over
as soon as possible.

1278
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:16,329
You'd have
to drop your shields

1279
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:17,789
to use your transporters.

1280
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:19,624
Let me worry about that.
Sisko out.

1281
01:05:26,715 --> 01:05:28,258
WORF:
Sir, restricting our fire

1282
01:05:28,258 --> 01:05:30,594
to their engines has not
proven effective.

1283
01:05:30,594 --> 01:05:32,721
Very well.
Target at your discretion.

1284
01:05:32,721 --> 01:05:34,180
Aye, aye, sir.

1285
01:05:49,237 --> 01:05:50,655
Dukat's ship is under fire.

1286
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:52,073
I don't know how much longer
they can hold out.

1287
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:54,367
Another Klingon ship
has just de-cloaked.

1288
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:56,160
It is a Vor'cha-class
attack cruiser.

1289
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,121
Sisko to Transporter Bay.

1290
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:00,707
Stand by to beam aboard
survivors.

1291
01:06:08,632 --> 01:06:10,216
Sisko to Bashir.

1292
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:11,718
Prepare to receive casualties.

1293
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:14,011
And, Doctor, have Security
standing by.

1294
01:06:14,011 --> 01:06:16,973
I want our guests
to undergo blood screenings.

1295
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:18,182
BASHIR: Understood.

1296
01:06:18,182 --> 01:06:19,267
Blood screenings?

1297
01:06:19,267 --> 01:06:21,853
Just in case Martok was right.

1298
01:06:21,853 --> 01:06:24,940
Benjamin, it's going to take
at least two minutes

1299
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:26,149
to evacuate Dukat's ship.

1300
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:27,651
Even with the<i> Defiant's</i>

1301
01:06:27,651 --> 01:06:28,902
new armor, I don't think
we can last that long

1302
01:06:28,902 --> 01:06:30,695
with our
shields down.

1303
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:31,947
WORF:
Sir.

1304
01:06:31,947 --> 01:06:33,281
I have a suggestion.

1305
01:06:42,624 --> 01:06:44,000
You were right, Mr. Worf.

1306
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,543
The modulated tractor
beam's deflecting

1307
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:47,587
some of the Klingon's
disrupter fire.

1308
01:06:47,587 --> 01:06:49,923
Disrupter's effectiveness
at 50 percent.

1309
01:06:49,923 --> 01:06:51,549
Well done, Mr. Worf.

1310
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:52,843
Lower shields.

1311
01:06:52,843 --> 01:06:54,385
Sisko to Transporter Bay.

1312
01:06:54,385 --> 01:06:56,346
Begin emergency transports.

1313
01:06:56,346 --> 01:06:58,139
Transports underway.

1314
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,352
The ablative armor is holding.

1315
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:04,020
Klingon ships are closing.

1316
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,271
Armor on the port side

1317
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:06,940
is losing integrity.

1318
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:09,442
Transporter Bay,
what's our status?

1319
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:12,069
Captain, this is Dukat.

1320
01:07:12,069 --> 01:07:14,865
Almost half the council members
are still aboard my ship.

1321
01:07:14,865 --> 01:07:17,575
We need at least another minute.

1322
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:19,202
Looks like we're going
to find out

1323
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:21,287
just how much of a pounding
this ship can take.

1324
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:23,080
The Klingons have closed

1325
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:24,541
to point-blank range.

1326
01:07:26,668 --> 01:07:28,336
DAX:
Ablative armor
has failed.

1327
01:07:28,336 --> 01:07:30,839
We've got plasma leaks
on decks 2, 3 and 5.

1328
01:07:30,839 --> 01:07:34,133
And we've lost our
aft torpedo launchers.

1329
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:35,092
Dukat to Sisko.

1330
01:07:35,092 --> 01:07:36,260
Go ahead.

1331
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:38,054
The council members are aboard.

1332
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,389
Raise shields.
Activate the cloak.

1333
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:41,098
WORF:
Shields up.

1334
01:07:41,098 --> 01:07:44,352
I'm not getting any response
from the cloaking device.

1335
01:07:44,352 --> 01:07:45,729
It's not working.

1336
01:07:45,729 --> 01:07:47,146
Well, that should make
the trip home

1337
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:48,439
a little more interesting.

1338
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:51,693
Set a course for DS9,
maximum warp.

1339
01:08:09,753 --> 01:08:12,047
Thank you, Doctor,
but if you don't mind,

1340
01:08:12,047 --> 01:08:14,007
I would like to go
to the Bridge now.

1341
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:16,133
This will only take a minute.
Your arm, please.

1342
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:18,135
What is the meaning
of this?

1343
01:08:18,135 --> 01:08:19,679
Just a simple
blood screening.

1344
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:22,891
I assure you, Doctor,
I am not a changeling.

1345
01:08:22,891 --> 01:08:24,559
Then you have nothing
to worry about.

1346
01:08:24,559 --> 01:08:26,644
I find this whole
procedure offensive.

1347
01:08:26,644 --> 01:08:27,645
And I find you offensive.

1348
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:29,064
Now hold up your arm,

1349
01:08:29,064 --> 01:08:31,274
or I'll have a Security
Officer do it for you.

1350
01:08:44,328 --> 01:08:46,831
Captain, would
you kindly inform

1351
01:08:46,831 --> 01:08:48,332
this security guard

1352
01:08:48,332 --> 01:08:51,753
that he does not have
to monitor my every move.

1353
01:08:51,753 --> 01:08:54,130
It makes me
feel unwelcome.

1354
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:56,340
DAX:
Looks like
I won, Benjamin.

1355
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:57,675
You owe me dinner.

1356
01:08:57,675 --> 01:09:00,303
And what is that
supposed to mean?

1357
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:03,473
Captain Sisko bet me that you
would thank him for the rescue

1358
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:05,182
before you started
complaining.

1359
01:09:05,182 --> 01:09:06,392
I lost.

1360
01:09:07,852 --> 01:09:12,273
Captain, are you aware
there's a Klingon

1361
01:09:12,273 --> 01:09:13,775
on your Bridge?

1362
01:09:13,775 --> 01:09:16,152
He's not the Klingon you
should be worried about.

1363
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:20,239
Switch to aft view,
maximum magnification.

1364
01:09:25,578 --> 01:09:27,747
Hmm.

1365
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:31,417
I'd suggest you cloak
immediately.

1366
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:34,129
We lost our cloaking device
rescuing you.

1367
01:09:48,143 --> 01:09:51,270
Might I trouble you
for a glass of<i> kanar?</i>

1368
01:09:54,357 --> 01:09:55,566
Help yourself.

1369
01:09:55,566 --> 01:09:57,152
It's on the house.

1370
01:09:57,152 --> 01:09:59,904
Well, how uncharacteristically
generous of you.

1371
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:02,032
I'm in an
uncharacteristic mood.

1372
01:10:02,032 --> 01:10:03,867
Besides, I've got
80 cases of this stuff

1373
01:10:03,867 --> 01:10:04,951
sitting in my stockroom.

1374
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:06,119
And the way things
are going,

1375
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:07,495
I'll never unload
another bottle

1376
01:10:07,495 --> 01:10:09,080
unless it's to you.

1377
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:11,624
How thoughtless of me
not to consider the effect

1378
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:15,211
the destruction of my homeworld
would have on your business.

1379
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:18,339
These must be
trying times for you.

1380
01:10:18,339 --> 01:10:19,716
Be brave.

1381
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:22,093
I should have listened
to my cousin Gaila.

1382
01:10:22,093 --> 01:10:26,263
He said to me, "Quark, I got
one word for you... weapons."

1383
01:10:26,263 --> 01:10:27,765
No one ever went broke

1384
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:29,017
selling weapons.

1385
01:10:29,017 --> 01:10:31,102
But did I take
his advice?

1386
01:10:31,102 --> 01:10:33,270
No.

1387
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:35,773
And why not?

1388
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:38,526
Because I'm a people person.

1389
01:10:38,526 --> 01:10:41,654
I like interacting
with my customers

1390
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:43,823
like you and I are doing
right now.

1391
01:10:43,823 --> 01:10:45,241
Talking to each other,

1392
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:47,035
getting to know
one another.

1393
01:10:47,035 --> 01:10:49,996
I can see the attraction
for you.

1394
01:10:49,996 --> 01:10:51,664
But when you're dealing
in weapons,

1395
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:54,167
buyers aren't interested
in casual conversation.

1396
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:56,086
They just want
their merchandise,

1397
01:10:56,086 --> 01:10:57,420
no questions asked.

1398
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:58,755
So impersonal.

1399
01:10:58,755 --> 01:11:01,132
Your charms would be wasted.

1400
01:11:01,132 --> 01:11:02,800
Exactly.

1401
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:08,264
So now, Gaila owns his own moon,

1402
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:12,018
and I'm staring into the abyss.

1403
01:11:12,018 --> 01:11:14,311
And the worst part of it is,

1404
01:11:14,311 --> 01:11:18,357
my only hope for salvation
is the Federation.

1405
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:21,569
I know precisely how you feel.

1406
01:11:27,324 --> 01:11:30,327
I want you to try
something for me.

1407
01:11:30,327 --> 01:11:31,955
Take sip of this.

1408
01:11:31,955 --> 01:11:33,164
What is it?

1409
01:11:33,164 --> 01:11:35,208
A human drink.

1410
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:36,709
It's called root beer.

1411
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:37,794
I don't know.

1412
01:11:37,794 --> 01:11:39,045
Come on.

1413
01:11:39,045 --> 01:11:41,881
Aren't you just
a little bit curious?

1414
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:44,842
(<i> sighs</i> )

1415
01:11:47,095 --> 01:11:48,596
What do you think?

1416
01:11:48,596 --> 01:11:50,473
It's vile.

1417
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:52,016
I know.

1418
01:11:52,016 --> 01:11:54,560
It's so bubbly and cloying

1419
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,353
and happy.

1420
01:11:56,353 --> 01:11:59,565
Just like the Federation.

1421
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:01,859
But you know
what's really frightening?

1422
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:06,114
If you drink enough of it,
you begin to like it.

1423
01:12:06,114 --> 01:12:08,283
It's insidious.

1424
01:12:08,283 --> 01:12:11,911
Just like the Federation.

1425
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:16,291
Do you think
they'll be able to save us?

1426
01:12:18,126 --> 01:12:20,211
I hope so.

1427
01:12:21,254 --> 01:12:22,839
Any luck?
Not yet.

1428
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:23,881
(<i> console beeps</i> )

1429
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:25,300
Hold on.

1430
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:28,261
I'm picking up something
on long-range scanners.

1431
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:29,345
It's the<i> Defiant.</i>

1432
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:30,680
They made it.

1433
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,890
Yeah, but they've got
two Klingon ships

1434
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:34,475
on their tail.

1435
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:36,853
The Captain's hailing us.

1436
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:38,938
On screen.

1437
01:12:38,938 --> 01:12:40,606
Chief, our ETA
is in five minutes.

1438
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:41,816
Are the new systems on line?

1439
01:12:41,816 --> 01:12:42,984
Yes, sir.

1440
01:12:42,984 --> 01:12:44,527
I think
we're going to need them.

1441
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:46,279
I wish we could have
tested them first.

1442
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:47,905
No time like the present.

1443
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:49,406
Raise shields.

1444
01:12:49,406 --> 01:12:51,075
Red Alert.

1445
01:12:51,075 --> 01:12:53,369
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

1446
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:54,537
Now what?!

1447
01:12:54,537 --> 01:12:56,372
Well, I can't be
sure, of course,

1448
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:58,541
but my guess
would be Klingons.

1449
01:12:58,541 --> 01:13:00,335
The Klingons?

1450
01:13:00,335 --> 01:13:04,339
First, it was the Cardassians,
then it was the Dominion,

1451
01:13:04,339 --> 01:13:06,465
<i>now</i> it's the Klingons!

1452
01:13:06,465 --> 01:13:08,176
How's a Ferengi supposed
to make an honest living

1453
01:13:08,176 --> 01:13:10,136
in a place like this?

1454
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:20,897
Drop out of warp.

1455
01:13:20,897 --> 01:13:22,106
Reverse thrusters
at maximum.

1456
01:13:22,106 --> 01:13:23,107
Prepare for docking.

1457
01:13:23,107 --> 01:13:24,275
DAX:
Aye, sir.

1458
01:13:24,275 --> 01:13:26,236
Well, it looks
like the Klingons

1459
01:13:26,236 --> 01:13:28,321
chased us all this way
for nothing.

1460
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:30,281
That remains to be seen.

1461
01:13:30,281 --> 01:13:33,243
Klingons do not give up easily.

1462
01:13:33,243 --> 01:13:35,286
Two ships against a station?

1463
01:13:35,286 --> 01:13:37,372
I don't think they'd risk it.

1464
01:13:37,372 --> 01:13:39,665
It may not be much of a risk.

1465
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:41,000
Why do you say that?

1466
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,543
They've got friends.

1467
01:13:54,264 --> 01:13:55,639
Status report, Major.

1468
01:13:55,639 --> 01:13:57,725
I'm detecting
several dozen Klingon ships

1469
01:13:57,725 --> 01:13:58,935
including the<i> Negh'Var.</i>

1470
01:13:58,935 --> 01:14:00,270
They're in
an attack formation.

1471
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:01,354
While you were gone,

1472
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:02,563
we spoke to
Starfleet Command.

1473
01:14:02,563 --> 01:14:03,773
They sent a
relief force

1474
01:14:03,773 --> 01:14:05,024
under Admiral Hastur.

1475
01:14:05,024 --> 01:14:06,276
When will they get here?

1476
01:14:06,276 --> 01:14:07,693
Not soon enough.

1477
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:10,071
DAX: The Klingon ships
have raised their shields

1478
01:14:10,071 --> 01:14:11,572
and charged
their weapons.

1479
01:14:11,572 --> 01:14:13,950
What are your
orders, Captain?

1480
01:14:18,162 --> 01:14:20,497
Battle stations.

1481
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:27,297
The thing to remember is
that the Klingons prefer to use

1482
01:14:27,297 --> 01:14:29,840
their knives and<i> bat'leths</i>
in close combat.

1483
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,635
So if we get boarded, you can
expect severe lacerations,

1484
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:35,554
broken bones,
and blunt force traumas.

1485
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:39,267
All I can say is keep calm,
remember your training...

1486
01:14:39,267 --> 01:14:41,352
and do the best that you can.

1487
01:14:41,352 --> 01:14:42,686
Report to your posts.

1488
01:14:46,565 --> 01:14:48,651
Doctor.

1489
01:14:48,651 --> 01:14:50,445
Constable, what can I
do for you?

1490
01:14:50,445 --> 01:14:51,528
I just wanted you

1491
01:14:51,528 --> 01:14:52,947
to know I'll be assigning

1492
01:14:52,947 --> 01:14:54,991
a security unit
to the Infirmary

1493
01:14:54,991 --> 01:14:56,367
for your protection.

1494
01:14:56,367 --> 01:14:58,244
Well, thank you,
but I'd rather you didn't.

1495
01:14:58,244 --> 01:14:59,745
I'm going to have
wounded people in here.

1496
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:01,080
The last thing I need
is a team of deputies

1497
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:03,040
having a fire fight
in my doorway.

1498
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,625
I understand.

1499
01:15:06,169 --> 01:15:07,837
Just do me a favor.

1500
01:15:07,837 --> 01:15:11,132
Don't count on that blue uniform
to protect you.

1501
01:15:11,132 --> 01:15:13,009
In the heat of battle,

1502
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:15,636
Klingons aren't very choosy
about their targets.

1503
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:17,013
Doctor or no doctor,

1504
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:20,141
you might end up
having to defend yourself.

1505
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:22,143
Well, hopefully,
it won't come to that.

1506
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:25,313
But if it does,
I promise you I'll be ready.

1507
01:15:25,313 --> 01:15:26,689
That's all I ask.

1508
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:28,691
And while we're
on the subject, Constable,

1509
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:30,567
I'm sure there's
more than one Klingon

1510
01:15:30,567 --> 01:15:32,528
who thinks that slaying
a changeling

1511
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:34,113
would be worthy
of a song or two.

1512
01:15:34,113 --> 01:15:35,990
Doctor, if a Klingon
<i>were</i> to kill me,

1513
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:39,327
I'd expect nothing less than
an entire opera on the subject.

1514
01:15:39,327 --> 01:15:40,953
Maybe.

1515
01:15:40,953 --> 01:15:43,247
I just don't want
to have to listen to it.

1516
01:15:43,247 --> 01:15:44,581
Watch your back.

1517
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:55,634
Come on, Quark,
move it along.

1518
01:15:55,634 --> 01:15:57,720
You should be
in the emergency
shelter by now.

1519
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,680
I'm not going
to any emergency shelter.

1520
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,974
This is my bar,
and I'm going to defend it.

1521
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:04,352
Really? And how do
you plan to do that?

1522
01:16:04,352 --> 01:16:05,644
With this.

1523
01:16:05,644 --> 01:16:07,688
You're going to hit
them with a box?

1524
01:16:07,688 --> 01:16:09,315
No. This is
my disrupter pistol.

1525
01:16:09,315 --> 01:16:10,691
The one I used to carry
in the old days

1526
01:16:10,691 --> 01:16:12,276
when I was serving
on that Ferengi freighter.

1527
01:16:12,276 --> 01:16:14,237
I thought you were
the ship's cook.

1528
01:16:14,237 --> 01:16:15,905
That's right.

1529
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:17,656
And every member of that crew
thought he was a food critic.

1530
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:20,493
If the Klingons try
to get through these doors,

1531
01:16:20,493 --> 01:16:22,453
I'll be ready for them.

1532
01:16:22,453 --> 01:16:24,830
"Dear Quark,

1533
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:27,417
"I used parts of your disrupter
to fix the replicators.

1534
01:16:27,417 --> 01:16:29,668
Will return them soon. Rom."

1535
01:16:29,668 --> 01:16:31,962
I will kill him.

1536
01:16:31,962 --> 01:16:33,464
With what?

1537
01:16:57,447 --> 01:17:00,283
That's close enough, Garak.

1538
01:17:00,283 --> 01:17:03,536
I wanted to make sure that
the council members were safe.

1539
01:17:03,536 --> 01:17:06,330
Hoping, no doubt,
that your concern

1540
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:09,500
would curry
some political favor?

1541
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,127
Oh, and I take it

1542
01:17:11,127 --> 01:17:15,214
your concern is motivated
<i>strictly</i> by patriotism.

1543
01:17:15,214 --> 01:17:18,926
Oh, the council members
are well aware of my patriotism.

1544
01:17:18,926 --> 01:17:23,264
And the sacrifices I was willing
to make in order to save them.

1545
01:17:23,264 --> 01:17:27,643
Now, why don't you go back
to your little tailor shop

1546
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:30,687
and sew something?

1547
01:17:30,687 --> 01:17:33,857
Because if the Klingons
<i>do</i> invade this station,

1548
01:17:33,857 --> 01:17:38,237
you may just need... my help.

1549
01:17:38,237 --> 01:17:40,697
Who would
have thought

1550
01:17:40,697 --> 01:17:43,159
that the two of us
would be fighting

1551
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:45,869
side by side.

1552
01:17:48,331 --> 01:17:51,125
Just remember
when you fire that thing,

1553
01:17:51,125 --> 01:17:53,710
you're aiming it
at a Klingon.

1554
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:56,339
I'll try to keep
that in mind.

1555
01:18:08,725 --> 01:18:10,436
(<i> console beeps</i> )

1556
01:18:10,436 --> 01:18:13,397
We're receiving a transmission
from General Martok.

1557
01:18:13,397 --> 01:18:15,191
Put him through.

1558
01:18:15,191 --> 01:18:17,485
Captain, I demand you surrender

1559
01:18:17,485 --> 01:18:20,363
the Cardassian council members
to us immediately.

1560
01:18:20,363 --> 01:18:22,281
They're not Founders, Martok.

1561
01:18:22,281 --> 01:18:23,574
We tested them.

1562
01:18:23,574 --> 01:18:24,617
You were wrong.

1563
01:18:24,617 --> 01:18:27,161
It is of no consequence.

1564
01:18:27,161 --> 01:18:30,540
All that matters is
the Alpha Quadrant will be safer

1565
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:33,376
with the Klingon Empire
in control of Cardassia.

1566
01:18:33,376 --> 01:18:36,671
<i>Now,</i> surrender
the council members,

1567
01:18:36,671 --> 01:18:39,256
or we will have no choice
but to take them by force.

1568
01:18:39,256 --> 01:18:42,635
And risk an all-out war
with the Federation?

1569
01:18:42,635 --> 01:18:45,513
If a war starts here,
the blame will be yours.

1570
01:18:45,513 --> 01:18:48,098
I doubt very much
history will agree.

1571
01:18:48,098 --> 01:18:50,017
History is written
by the victors.

1572
01:18:50,017 --> 01:18:51,977
Consider what you're
doing, Captain.

1573
01:18:51,977 --> 01:18:55,648
The lives of everyone on
your station are at risk.

1574
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:57,233
I am aware of that.

1575
01:18:57,233 --> 01:18:59,610
But maybe you're not aware
of what you're risking.

1576
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:01,571
We've had a year
to prepare this station

1577
01:19:01,571 --> 01:19:05,115
for a Dominion attack,
and we're more than ready.

1578
01:19:05,115 --> 01:19:06,617
(<i> chuckles</i> )

1579
01:19:06,617 --> 01:19:09,370
You're like a toothless
old<i> Grishnar</i> cat,

1580
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:12,623
trying to frighten us
with your roar.

1581
01:19:12,623 --> 01:19:14,124
I can assure you

1582
01:19:14,124 --> 01:19:17,794
this old cat may not be
as toothless as you think.

1583
01:19:17,794 --> 01:19:20,881
Right now, I've got
5,000 photon torpedoes

1584
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:22,592
armed and ready to launch.

1585
01:19:22,592 --> 01:19:26,596
If you don't believe me,
feel free to scan the station.

1586
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:31,308
It is a trick.

1587
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:32,643
An illusion created

1588
01:19:32,643 --> 01:19:35,896
by thoron fields
and duranium shadows.

1589
01:19:35,896 --> 01:19:38,148
It's no illusion.

1590
01:19:38,148 --> 01:19:40,109
We shall see.

1591
01:19:40,109 --> 01:19:43,237
<i>CHEGH-chew jaj-VAM jaj-KAK!</i>

1592
01:19:47,824 --> 01:19:51,828
He said,
"Today is a good day to die."

1593
01:20:12,224 --> 01:20:13,850
Target the lead ships.

1594
01:20:13,850 --> 01:20:15,936
Ready even-numbered
photon launchers.

1595
01:20:15,936 --> 01:20:17,563
WORF:
Aye, sir.

1596
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:29,866
Fire on my mark.

1597
01:20:31,868 --> 01:20:33,412
Fire!

1598
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:43,172
Ready odd-numbered launchers.

1599
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:46,883
Fire!

1600
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:51,888
They're still closing.

1601
01:20:51,888 --> 01:20:53,724
Ready phasers.

1602
01:20:53,724 --> 01:20:54,809
Standing by.

1603
01:20:54,809 --> 01:20:55,976
Fire!

1604
01:21:05,027 --> 01:21:06,529
Eight Klingon ships destroyed.

1605
01:21:06,529 --> 01:21:07,613
Several heavily damaged.

1606
01:21:07,613 --> 01:21:08,614
Contact Gowron.

1607
01:21:08,614 --> 01:21:10,407
Maybe we can put an end to this

1608
01:21:10,407 --> 01:21:12,034
before it gets any further.

1609
01:21:14,203 --> 01:21:15,912
They're not responding.

1610
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:21,460
They have given you
your answer, Captain.

1611
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:26,048
Weapons stations, fire at will.

1612
01:21:42,939 --> 01:21:45,025
<i>A TLING-on kaogh.</i>

1613
01:21:45,025 --> 01:21:46,402
<i>Zo a TLING-on HegH-lah.</i>

1614
01:21:46,402 --> 01:21:47,944
<i>YoD-wee KAW.</i>

1615
01:21:47,944 --> 01:21:49,154
<i>TIG-mang-Rup.</i>

1616
01:21:49,154 --> 01:21:50,906
<i>jee-YAJ.</i>

1617
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:53,909
<i>DuJ-va, YoD-wee KAW!</i>

1618
01:21:58,873 --> 01:22:00,207
(<i> screams</i> )

1619
01:22:04,253 --> 01:22:07,548
They've disabled
two of our shield generators.

1620
01:22:15,305 --> 01:22:16,599
(<i> groans</i> )

1621
01:22:17,974 --> 01:22:19,017
(<i> yells</i> )

1622
01:22:35,992 --> 01:22:37,286
(<i> screams</i> )

1623
01:22:40,372 --> 01:22:42,040
(<i> screams</i> )

1624
01:22:48,297 --> 01:22:49,673
(<i> groans</i> )

1625
01:22:51,174 --> 01:22:52,635
Thank you, Doctor.

1626
01:22:52,635 --> 01:22:54,010
Any time.

1627
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:57,389
I find this
hand-to-hand combat

1628
01:22:57,389 --> 01:22:59,266
really quite
distasteful.

1629
01:22:59,266 --> 01:23:00,893
DUKAT:
I suppose you prefer
the simplicity

1630
01:23:00,893 --> 01:23:03,061
of an interrogation chamber.

1631
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:06,315
You have to admit,
it's much more civilized.

1632
01:24:04,707 --> 01:24:06,792
(<i> coughing</i> )

1633
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:20,096
Mr. O'Brien?

1634
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:21,264
Yeah.

1635
01:24:21,264 --> 01:24:23,350
Get those shields
back on line.

1636
01:24:29,023 --> 01:24:30,482
Major?

1637
01:24:30,482 --> 01:24:32,108
I'll be okay.
It's not as bad as it looks.

1638
01:24:32,108 --> 01:24:33,485
Sisko to Odo.

1639
01:24:33,485 --> 01:24:34,486
Odo here.

1640
01:24:34,486 --> 01:24:35,529
Status report.

1641
01:24:35,529 --> 01:24:36,864
ODO:
We have Klingon troops

1642
01:24:36,864 --> 01:24:38,574
on the Promenade,
the Habitat Ring,

1643
01:24:38,574 --> 01:24:39,783
and Lower Pylon Three.

1644
01:24:39,783 --> 01:24:41,201
They seem to be
contained for now,

1645
01:24:41,201 --> 01:24:42,202
but I can't guarantee

1646
01:24:42,202 --> 01:24:43,328
it'll stay that way.

1647
01:24:43,328 --> 01:24:44,413
Keep me informed.

1648
01:24:46,665 --> 01:24:49,209
There is another wave
of Klingon ships coming in.

1649
01:24:49,209 --> 01:24:50,586
I've got the shields back up,

1650
01:24:50,586 --> 01:24:52,379
but I don't know
how long they'll hold.

1651
01:24:52,379 --> 01:24:54,924
I'm reading a cluster
of warp signatures approaching,

1652
01:24:54,924 --> 01:24:57,634
bearing 187 mark 025.

1653
01:24:57,634 --> 01:24:58,844
It's Starfleet, Benjamin.

1654
01:24:58,844 --> 01:25:01,096
Six starships led
by the<i> Venture.</i>

1655
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:03,139
They'll be here
in 15 minutes.

1656
01:25:03,139 --> 01:25:06,226
Contact the<i> Negh'Var</i> again.

1657
01:25:06,226 --> 01:25:08,896
Maybe now Gowron will be
in the mood to talk.

1658
01:25:08,896 --> 01:25:10,105
DAX:
I've got him.

1659
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:11,815
GOWRON:
Captain, your shields

1660
01:25:11,815 --> 01:25:13,567
have been weakened,
your station boarded,

1661
01:25:13,567 --> 01:25:15,945
and more Klingon ships
are on their way.

1662
01:25:15,945 --> 01:25:17,071
Surrender while you can.

1663
01:25:17,071 --> 01:25:18,655
I don't think so.

1664
01:25:18,655 --> 01:25:20,074
My shields are holding.

1665
01:25:20,074 --> 01:25:21,784
Your boarding parties
are contained.

1666
01:25:21,784 --> 01:25:24,327
And my reinforcements
are closer than yours.

1667
01:25:24,327 --> 01:25:26,121
You're facing a war
on two fronts.

1668
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:28,164
Is that what you really want?

1669
01:25:28,164 --> 01:25:29,666
The Empire is not strong enough

1670
01:25:29,666 --> 01:25:32,294
to fight the Federation
<i>and</i> the Cardassians.

1671
01:25:32,294 --> 01:25:34,004
End this now, Gowron,

1672
01:25:34,004 --> 01:25:37,340
before you lead the Empire
to its worst defeat in history.

1673
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:39,384
We will<i> not</i> surrender!

1674
01:25:39,384 --> 01:25:42,345
This is exactly
what the Founders want.

1675
01:25:42,345 --> 01:25:44,389
Klingon against Cardassian.

1676
01:25:44,389 --> 01:25:46,433
Federation against Klingon.

1677
01:25:46,433 --> 01:25:49,519
The more we fight each other,
the weaker we'll get,

1678
01:25:49,519 --> 01:25:52,564
and the less chance we have
against the Dominion.

1679
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:55,025
Consider what you do here,
Gowron.

1680
01:25:55,025 --> 01:25:57,111
Kahless himself said,

1681
01:25:57,111 --> 01:26:01,323
"Destroying an Empire
to win a war is no victory."

1682
01:26:01,323 --> 01:26:05,160
"And ending a battle to save
an Empire is no defeat."

1683
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,620
We can still win!

1684
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:09,999
Not before those Starships
get here.

1685
01:26:09,999 --> 01:26:12,167
Now, what do you want me
to tell them?

1686
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:16,546
To stand down,
or to come in firing?

1687
01:26:17,881 --> 01:26:20,134
It is we
who shall stand down.

1688
01:26:20,134 --> 01:26:21,802
<i>Ach, Gowron, yay chol!</i>

1689
01:26:21,802 --> 01:26:22,845
Enough.

1690
01:26:22,845 --> 01:26:24,054
Cease fire.

1691
01:26:24,054 --> 01:26:25,597
Order our ships
in Cardassian territory

1692
01:26:25,597 --> 01:26:27,016
to halt their advance.

1693
01:26:27,016 --> 01:26:31,186
I do not intend to hand victory
to the Dominion.

1694
01:26:31,186 --> 01:26:32,896
But let your people know

1695
01:26:32,896 --> 01:26:36,316
the Klingon Empire will remember
what has happened here.

1696
01:26:36,316 --> 01:26:39,111
You have sided against us
in battle,

1697
01:26:39,111 --> 01:26:45,159
and this, we do not forgive...
or forget.

1698
01:26:49,872 --> 01:26:53,458
The Klingon ships
have powered down their weapons.

1699
01:26:55,002 --> 01:26:56,712
It's over.

1700
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:01,925
For now.

1701
01:27:04,427 --> 01:27:08,473
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 49011.4.</i>

1702
01:27:08,473 --> 01:27:10,851
<i>Gowron has returned</i>
<i>to the Klingon Homeworld,</i>

1703
01:27:10,851 --> 01:27:14,646
<i>and his task force has</i>
<i>withdrawn from Bajoran space.</i>

1704
01:27:14,646 --> 01:27:17,315
<i>I don't know if I can</i>
<i>fully express the pride I felt</i>

1705
01:27:17,315 --> 01:27:19,275
<i>at seeing how well</i>
<i>Deep Space 9 and its crew</i>

1706
01:27:19,275 --> 01:27:22,029
<i>weathered this latest crisis.</i>

1707
01:27:22,029 --> 01:27:24,489
<i>Though the station</i>
<i>suffered heavy damage</i>

1708
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:26,033
<i>during the Klingon attack,</i>

1709
01:27:26,033 --> 01:27:28,284
<i>repairs are</i>
<i>well ahead of schedule</i>

1710
01:27:28,284 --> 01:27:30,996
<i>and life on the station is</i>
<i>beginning to return to normal,</i>

1711
01:27:30,996 --> 01:27:35,250
<i>leaving me with one final piece</i>
<i>of unfinished business.</i>

1712
01:27:46,887 --> 01:27:49,723
(<i> door chimes</i> )

1713
01:27:49,723 --> 01:27:51,516
Enter.

1714
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:55,979
I brought your discharge papers.

1715
01:27:55,979 --> 01:27:57,814
I thought you might want
to take a look at them

1716
01:27:57,814 --> 01:27:59,524
before I send them off
to Starfleet.

1717
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:01,193
Thank you, sir.

1718
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:07,532
I understand you're headed
for the Nyberrite Alliance.

1719
01:28:07,532 --> 01:28:08,825
Yes, I leave

1720
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:10,535
this afternoon.

1721
01:28:11,536 --> 01:28:13,622
For me, it was a job on Earth,

1722
01:28:13,622 --> 01:28:16,959
directing construction
of orbital habitats.

1723
01:28:18,794 --> 01:28:20,796
Why did you change your mind?

1724
01:28:20,796 --> 01:28:22,839
I finally realized

1725
01:28:22,839 --> 01:28:26,927
that it wasn't Starfleet
I wanted to get away from.

1726
01:28:26,927 --> 01:28:32,724
I was trying to escape the pain
I felt after my wife's death.

1727
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:36,352
I thought I could take
the uniform,

1728
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:40,649
wrap it around that pain,
and toss them both away.

1729
01:28:40,649 --> 01:28:44,153
But it doesn't work like that.

1730
01:28:44,153 --> 01:28:47,572
Running may help,
for a little while,

1731
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:51,160
but sooner or later the pain
catches up with you,

1732
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:53,245
and the only way
to get rid of it

1733
01:28:53,245 --> 01:28:57,373
is to stand your ground
and face it.

1734
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:01,586
But wearing that uniform
must remind you

1735
01:29:01,586 --> 01:29:03,213
of what you have lost.

1736
01:29:03,213 --> 01:29:05,966
Sometimes...

1737
01:29:05,966 --> 01:29:09,094
but it also reminds me
of what I've gained

1738
01:29:09,094 --> 01:29:10,637
and who I am.

1739
01:29:10,637 --> 01:29:13,182
Oh, I can throw away
the uniform,

1740
01:29:13,182 --> 01:29:16,601
resign my commission,
run all the way

1741
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:19,562
to the Nyberrite
Alliance...

1742
01:29:19,562 --> 01:29:22,316
but it really wouldn't matter.

1743
01:29:22,316 --> 01:29:26,736
A Starfleet Officer--

1744
01:29:26,736 --> 01:29:28,404
that's what I am,

1745
01:29:28,404 --> 01:29:30,824
and that's what I'll always be.

1746
01:29:33,785 --> 01:29:35,745
And you think that is true
of me as well.

1747
01:29:35,745 --> 01:29:40,083
What's important, Mr. Worf,
is what you think.

1748
01:29:42,669 --> 01:29:46,215
I think Starfleet has been
my home for many years.

1749
01:29:47,841 --> 01:29:50,426
Perhaps it still is.

1750
01:29:50,426 --> 01:29:53,847
There are starships out there

1751
01:29:53,847 --> 01:29:56,683
that are in need
of good officers.

1752
01:29:56,683 --> 01:30:00,478
In fact, the Captain of
the<i> Venture</i> is a friend of mine.

1753
01:30:00,478 --> 01:30:03,106
If you'd like,
I can talk to him,

1754
01:30:03,106 --> 01:30:07,069
see if he has an opening
for a Lieutenant Commander.

1755
01:30:11,073 --> 01:30:14,408
Perhaps that
will not be necessary.

1756
01:30:25,337 --> 01:30:26,588
Lieutenant Commander Worf

1757
01:30:26,588 --> 01:30:28,548
reporting
for duty, sir.

1758
01:30:28,548 --> 01:30:32,969
Well, you all know our new
Strategic Operations Officer.

1759
01:30:32,969 --> 01:30:33,887
Commander.

1760
01:30:33,887 --> 01:30:34,888
Glad you're here.

1761
01:30:34,888 --> 01:30:36,014
Thank you.
Thank you.

1762
01:30:36,014 --> 01:30:37,015
Congratulations.

1763
01:30:37,015 --> 01:30:38,225
Assume your post,

1764
01:30:38,225 --> 01:30:39,559
Mr. Worf.

1765
01:30:39,559 --> 01:30:40,852
Yes, sir.

1766
01:30:42,271 --> 01:30:45,148
You look good in red.

1767
01:30:45,148 --> 01:30:46,733
It feels good.

1768
01:30:46,733 --> 01:30:49,819
But I have a lot to
learn about command.

1769
01:30:49,819 --> 01:30:52,364
Well, you couldn't ask
for a better teacher.

1770
01:30:54,866 --> 01:30:57,660
Now that everyone is here,
I wanted you to know

1771
01:30:57,660 --> 01:30:59,288
I've spoken with Dukat

1772
01:30:59,288 --> 01:31:01,998
and several members
of the Detapa Council.

1773
01:31:01,998 --> 01:31:05,127
They've returned to Cardassia
Prime without incident

1774
01:31:05,127 --> 01:31:08,380
and wanted me to convey to you
their personal thanks.

1775
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:10,173
(<i> sighs</i> )

1776
01:31:10,173 --> 01:31:12,259
Who'd have thought I'd help
save the Cardassian government?

1777
01:31:12,259 --> 01:31:13,718
ODO:
Don't worry.

1778
01:31:13,718 --> 01:31:16,679
I'm sure Gul Dukat
will take all the credit.

1779
01:31:16,679 --> 01:31:18,556
Poor Garak-- Dukat's a hero,

1780
01:31:18,556 --> 01:31:22,144
and Garak's still stuck in his
tailor shop hemming trousers.

1781
01:31:22,144 --> 01:31:25,355
Captain, I'm receiving
a priority one message

1782
01:31:25,355 --> 01:31:26,982
from Starfleet
Intelligence.

1783
01:31:26,982 --> 01:31:29,359
The Klingons are refusing
to give up

1784
01:31:29,359 --> 01:31:31,569
several
of the Cardassian colonies

1785
01:31:31,569 --> 01:31:33,405
they seized during the invasion.

1786
01:31:33,405 --> 01:31:35,740
They're fortifying
their positions

1787
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:38,534
and deploying
orbital defense systems.

1788
01:31:38,534 --> 01:31:41,621
Looks like the Klingons
are here to stay.

1789
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:50,297
Maybe they are...

1790
01:31:52,048 --> 01:31:54,301
but so are we.
