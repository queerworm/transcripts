1
00:00:32,002 --> 00:00:33,232
O'Brien to Sisko.

2
00:00:33,305 --> 00:00:34,706
Go ahead.

3
00:00:34,742 --> 00:00:37,340
We've swept all of Level 17.
No sign of the changeling.

4
00:00:37,381 --> 00:00:38,349
Move down to 18.

5
00:00:38,384 --> 00:00:39,374
We'll meet you there

6
00:00:39,419 --> 00:00:41,890
after we finish checking
the guest quarters.

7
00:00:41,926 --> 00:00:43,259
Watch yourself, Chief.

8
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:45,527
This changeling knows
the station as well as we do.

9
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,128
He could be anywhere...
or anything.

10
00:00:47,171 --> 00:00:48,299
Aye, Major.

11
00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:00,168
We found him!

12
00:01:00,202 --> 00:01:02,435
He's headed to the Promenade!

13
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,273
All right, I want phaser sweeps
of everything on the Promenade.

14
00:01:18,346 --> 00:01:19,645
He's here somewhere.
Let's find him.

15
00:01:19,682 --> 00:01:20,776
On three.

16
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:22,813
One... two...

17
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,402
Bang. You're dead.

18
00:01:30,441 --> 00:01:32,605
And so is Dr. Bashir.

19
00:01:35,186 --> 00:01:36,450
Computer, elapsed time?

20
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,518
Three hours, 27 minutes.

21
00:01:38,561 --> 00:01:39,860
That's not good enough.

22
00:01:39,898 --> 00:01:42,199
If one of my people were loose
on the station for that long

23
00:01:42,237 --> 00:01:44,174
there's no telling how much
damage they could do.

24
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:45,677
Schedule another surprise drill.

25
00:01:45,712 --> 00:01:47,341
If the Dominion tries
to infiltrate the station

26
00:01:47,382 --> 00:01:48,350
I want to be ready for them.

27
00:01:48,452 --> 00:01:49,716
And remind everyone

28
00:01:49,754 --> 00:01:51,952
that next time, they'd
better sweep everything.

29
00:01:51,994 --> 00:01:54,363
A changeling can be anything...
a post, a pillar

30
00:01:54,466 --> 00:01:56,369
even a patch
of reflective surfacing.

31
00:01:56,404 --> 00:01:57,532
We get the message, Constable.

32
00:01:57,573 --> 00:01:58,837
I hope so, Chief.

33
00:01:58,876 --> 00:02:00,140
Just remember that the Founders

34
00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:01,944
are even better shape-shifters
than I am.

35
00:02:01,984 --> 00:02:03,544
Excuse me.

36
00:02:03,588 --> 00:02:05,456
If you're done
scaring my customers away

37
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:06,722
I'd like to open the bar.

38
00:02:06,762 --> 00:02:08,095
Go right ahead.

39
00:02:08,132 --> 00:02:09,328
Thank you.

40
00:02:09,368 --> 00:02:10,962
Constable...

41
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:13,603
it just occurred to me
that, if I knew in advance

42
00:02:13,645 --> 00:02:15,046
just how long it will take

43
00:02:15,082 --> 00:02:17,553
for them to catch you
during the next drill...

44
00:02:17,588 --> 00:02:18,955
Well, let's just say

45
00:02:18,991 --> 00:02:21,987
you and I could share
a substantial profit.

46
00:02:23,368 --> 00:02:25,236
Think about it.

47
00:02:25,273 --> 00:02:27,369
Performance reviews
will be held tomorrow

48
00:02:27,445 --> 00:02:29,473
starting at 0800 hours
in the Wardroom.

49
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,384
Check your team leaders
for the schedule.

50
00:02:31,455 --> 00:02:32,924
Dismissed.

51
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:36,623
How about some dinner?

52
00:02:36,667 --> 00:02:37,635
Oh, not tonight.

53
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:39,070
I have a previous engagement.

54
00:02:39,106 --> 00:02:40,074
Oh, that's right...

55
00:02:40,109 --> 00:02:41,408
Captain Yates got in
this morning.

56
00:02:41,512 --> 00:02:42,606
Give her my regards.

57
00:02:42,648 --> 00:02:44,710
I will.

58
00:02:54,243 --> 00:02:55,233
Come in.

59
00:02:59,822 --> 00:03:01,052
Hello, Ben.

60
00:03:01,092 --> 00:03:03,120
I hope I'm not too late.

61
00:03:03,164 --> 00:03:07,938
Some things are
worth waiting for.

62
00:03:07,975 --> 00:03:09,672
Oh...

63
00:03:09,713 --> 00:03:11,911
Nice...

64
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:14,856
I'm glad you like it.

65
00:03:21,775 --> 00:03:22,971
For you.

66
00:03:23,011 --> 00:03:25,380
Isn't that a coincidence?

67
00:03:25,417 --> 00:03:26,977
I have something for you, too.

68
00:03:28,825 --> 00:03:29,953
Uh...

69
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:35,304
Oh!

70
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:38,041
Where did you find
Tholian silk?

71
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:42,649
The Tholian Ambassador
owed me a favor.

72
00:03:42,691 --> 00:03:44,354
May I?

73
00:03:44,396 --> 00:03:45,831
It's... not silk

74
00:03:45,866 --> 00:03:47,358
but I-I think you'll like it.

75
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,844
It's from my brother's team.

76
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,010
The Pike City Pioneers.

77
00:03:54,052 --> 00:03:56,489
My brother says if you're
ever on Cestus III

78
00:03:56,525 --> 00:03:58,826
he'll get you seats
in the dugout.

79
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,163
How far is Cestus III?

80
00:04:00,201 --> 00:04:04,234
Eight weeks, at maximum warp.

81
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:07,250
To see a real baseball game...

82
00:04:07,284 --> 00:04:09,882
it might be worth the trip.

83
00:04:09,923 --> 00:04:13,762
If you ever decide to go,
I'll take you there myself...

84
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,271
as long as you don't mind
traveling by freighter.

85
00:04:16,305 --> 00:04:19,335
I just might take
you up on that.

86
00:04:21,017 --> 00:04:22,179
Oh!

87
00:04:23,657 --> 00:04:26,186
Did you do this all yourself?

88
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:31,766
Well, my father always says
the way to a woman's heart

89
00:04:31,809 --> 00:04:33,472
is through her stomach.

90
00:04:33,513 --> 00:04:37,922
So it's my heart you're after.

91
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,655
I never could keep a secret.

92
00:04:39,695 --> 00:04:42,862
In that case, uh,
maybe you could tell me

93
00:04:42,903 --> 00:04:46,344
what all those maintenance crews
are doing in the docking ring.

94
00:04:46,377 --> 00:04:48,678
Just some retrofitting.

95
00:04:48,717 --> 00:04:51,211
Now you are keeping a secret.

96
00:04:51,256 --> 00:04:56,291
Let's just say...
we're preparing a few surprises

97
00:04:56,335 --> 00:04:59,001
just in case the Dominion
comes through the wormhole.

98
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:02,173
It seems like everyone's
got the Dominion

99
00:05:02,216 --> 00:05:04,244
on their minds these days.

100
00:05:04,287 --> 00:05:07,226
I hear the Cardassians
have even sealed their borders.

101
00:05:07,261 --> 00:05:12,570
What do you say we forget
about... business for a while?

102
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,613
I'd say that's a good idea.

103
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,796
Dax to Sisko.

104
00:05:25,805 --> 00:05:27,035
Go ahead.

105
00:05:27,075 --> 00:05:29,205
I think you'd better
get up here.

106
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,494
On my way.

107
00:05:39,104 --> 00:05:42,806
I'll be back as...
soon as I can.

108
00:05:42,846 --> 00:05:44,440
I know you will.

109
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,569
Benjamin, take a look at this.

110
00:05:56,613 --> 00:05:58,777
We've got
some unexpected company.

111
00:05:58,818 --> 00:06:00,880
It's just de-cloaked.

112
00:06:00,923 --> 00:06:02,826
Ah, the new Klingon flagship.

113
00:06:02,861 --> 00:06:04,057
The <i>Negh'Var.</i>

114
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,899
There's a General Martok on
board asking to speak with you.

115
00:06:06,937 --> 00:06:08,236
Put him through.

116
00:06:09,777 --> 00:06:11,941
Captain Sisko,
I bring you greetings

117
00:06:11,983 --> 00:06:14,820
from your allies
in the Klingon Empire.

118
00:06:14,856 --> 00:06:16,918
Welcome to Deep Space 9,
General.

119
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:19,023
Is there something
I can do for you?

120
00:06:19,066 --> 00:06:21,037
It has been a long journey.

121
00:06:21,071 --> 00:06:22,472
My men require shore leave.

122
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:25,208
Certainly. They can come
aboard any time they like.

123
00:06:25,248 --> 00:06:26,774
Good.

124
00:06:26,818 --> 00:06:28,412
<i>Sowee TAH!</i>

125
00:08:56,201 --> 00:08:57,966
Oh, Chief...

126
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,564
I'm beginning to think
there's no limit

127
00:08:59,608 --> 00:09:00,907
to the wonders you can perform.

128
00:09:00,945 --> 00:09:03,178
That's what I like about you,
Julian...

129
00:09:03,217 --> 00:09:05,154
you're easily impressed.

130
00:09:06,158 --> 00:09:07,354
Thank you, Quark.

131
00:09:07,393 --> 00:09:09,957
Can we get a little <i>yamok</i> sauce
for these sand peas?

132
00:09:14,177 --> 00:09:15,407
- Quark?
- Listen.

133
00:09:15,447 --> 00:09:16,415
Do you hear that?

134
00:09:17,952 --> 00:09:19,353
I don't hear a thing.

135
00:09:19,389 --> 00:09:23,593
Exactly. The ambient noise level
in this room

136
00:09:23,633 --> 00:09:25,661
is less than 30 decibels.

137
00:09:25,704 --> 00:09:28,198
On an average day, it's 65.

138
00:09:28,243 --> 00:09:31,444
When there are Klingons in the
room, it can go as high as 85.

139
00:09:31,485 --> 00:09:35,017
So what you're trying
to say is... it's quiet in here.

140
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,031
Too quiet.

141
00:09:37,132 --> 00:09:38,829
Something is terribly wrong.

142
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:39,894
Well, like what?

143
00:09:39,939 --> 00:09:41,033
I don't know

144
00:09:41,141 --> 00:09:44,342
but have you ever met
a quiet Klingon before?

145
00:09:44,382 --> 00:09:48,518
Look how they're watching
the room.

146
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:50,256
It's like they're
picking out targets.

147
00:09:53,638 --> 00:09:56,236
Where are you going?

148
00:09:56,278 --> 00:09:57,246
Well, I thought

149
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,613
I'd ask the Klingons
what they're up to.

150
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,618
Don't do that.

151
00:09:59,652 --> 00:10:00,746
Why not?

152
00:10:00,788 --> 00:10:02,952
Because I don't want them
to know we're onto them.

153
00:10:02,994 --> 00:10:04,190
Well, suit yourself.

154
00:10:08,206 --> 00:10:12,205
No, the secret is positioning
the pea correctly on the hand.

155
00:10:12,249 --> 00:10:13,217
But I thought I had that.

156
00:10:13,251 --> 00:10:14,584
What are you two doing?

157
00:10:14,621 --> 00:10:17,321
I'm telling you, the Klingons
are up to something.

158
00:10:17,361 --> 00:10:18,386
Calm down, Quark.

159
00:10:18,431 --> 00:10:19,866
The Klingons are our allies.

160
00:10:19,901 --> 00:10:23,137
They might be your allies,
but they're not mine.

161
00:10:23,175 --> 00:10:25,146
Relax. If there's something up
with the Klingons

162
00:10:25,213 --> 00:10:26,807
Captain Sisko
will find out about it.

163
00:10:28,054 --> 00:10:31,756
Yeah, but will he tell me?

164
00:10:31,796 --> 00:10:33,994
So, what brings you here,
General?

165
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:36,164
A valid question.

166
00:10:36,206 --> 00:10:38,268
But first...

167
00:10:38,311 --> 00:10:41,808
let us be sure we are all
who we say we are.

168
00:10:51,744 --> 00:10:53,407
You think we're changelings?

169
00:10:53,448 --> 00:10:56,752
What I think doesn't matter.

170
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:59,523
The blood will tell.

171
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,309
Hmm...

172
00:11:23,352 --> 00:11:25,984
Now that that's over with...

173
00:11:26,026 --> 00:11:31,700
We have been sent here to fight
alongside our Federation allies

174
00:11:31,739 --> 00:11:33,676
against the Dominion.

175
00:11:33,711 --> 00:11:35,078
I appreciate your gesture

176
00:11:35,114 --> 00:11:37,176
but I'm not sure it's necessary.

177
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,216
The Klingon High Council
thinks it is.

178
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,493
Our communications relay
in the Gamma Quadrant

179
00:11:42,532 --> 00:11:45,403
hasn't detected any signs
of Jem'Hadar activity

180
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:46,806
for quite some time.

181
00:11:46,842 --> 00:11:49,406
They seem to be giving
the wormhole a wide berth.

182
00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:51,283
They will come

183
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:55,659
and when they do,
we will be ready for them.

184
00:12:07,057 --> 00:12:08,424
Oh, there you are.

185
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,693
We've been looking
all over for you.

186
00:12:10,733 --> 00:12:13,467
Malko here just gave me
the most...

187
00:12:13,506 --> 00:12:16,000
amazing massage

188
00:12:16,046 --> 00:12:18,712
and I'm sure, if you ask nicely,
he'll do the same for you.

189
00:12:18,752 --> 00:12:20,916
No, thanks.

190
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,054
Why?

191
00:12:23,096 --> 00:12:24,497
Because Malko's not real.

192
00:12:24,533 --> 00:12:27,004
He's a puppet
made out of holographic light

193
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:28,268
and replicated matter.

194
00:12:28,308 --> 00:12:29,834
Boys...

195
00:12:29,878 --> 00:12:31,347
can you wait outside?

196
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,326
Are you afraid I hurt
their feelings?

197
00:12:39,369 --> 00:12:40,476
Oh, you really should try to get
into the spirit of things.

198
00:12:40,475 --> 00:12:42,001
Oh, you really should try to get
into the spirit of things.

199
00:12:42,045 --> 00:12:44,950
People come from all over Trill
to visit the Hoobishan Baths.

200
00:12:44,985 --> 00:12:47,583
If I'm ever on Trill,
I'm sure I'll visit them

201
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,562
but we're not on Trill

202
00:12:49,597 --> 00:12:51,591
and this isn't
the Hoobishan Baths.

203
00:12:51,635 --> 00:12:54,004
It's a holosuite,
and none of it is real.

204
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,237
And?

205
00:12:55,277 --> 00:12:57,111
"And"?

206
00:12:57,148 --> 00:13:01,055
I'm sorry. I feel silly.

207
00:13:01,091 --> 00:13:03,962
Good! That's
what a holosuite's for...

208
00:13:03,998 --> 00:13:05,627
to have a good time.

209
00:13:05,668 --> 00:13:09,974
All you have to do is relax
and use your imagination.

210
00:13:11,516 --> 00:13:13,851
I guess I don't have
much of an imagination.

211
00:13:13,888 --> 00:13:16,952
Of course you do.
Everyone does.

212
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:20,938
Didn't you play make-believe
when you were a child?

213
00:13:20,972 --> 00:13:23,409
Yeah. I used to make
believe the Cardassians

214
00:13:23,444 --> 00:13:25,107
would stop killing the Bajorans

215
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:26,345
and just go away.

216
00:13:26,385 --> 00:13:27,547
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

217
00:13:27,588 --> 00:13:28,716
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

218
00:13:28,758 --> 00:13:34,466
I... I guess I never had
much use for my imagination.

219
00:13:34,505 --> 00:13:37,103
I mean, look at me.

220
00:13:37,144 --> 00:13:39,274
You plan a fun evening for us

221
00:13:39,315 --> 00:13:43,257
and all I can do is sit here
and worry about Klingons.

222
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:45,195
You can worry
about the Klingons tomorrow.

223
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,701
From what I hear,
they're not going anywhere.

224
00:13:47,736 --> 00:13:51,906
And as for your underdeveloped
imagination

225
00:13:51,946 --> 00:13:56,617
I prescribe
a strict regime of exercise

226
00:13:56,658 --> 00:13:58,526
starting immediately.

227
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:02,093
All right.

228
00:14:02,137 --> 00:14:04,233
I'll give it a try.

229
00:14:04,275 --> 00:14:05,869
That's all I ask.

230
00:14:05,913 --> 00:14:09,820
Come on. Malko couldn't
have gone far.

231
00:14:44,673 --> 00:14:48,341
Fascinating.
So both the cup and the liquid

232
00:14:48,381 --> 00:14:50,146
are merely extensions
of your body.

233
00:14:50,186 --> 00:14:51,587
That is correct.

234
00:14:51,623 --> 00:14:54,755
And if I want to,
I can even drink the liquid

235
00:14:54,797 --> 00:14:56,164
reabsorb it

236
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,302
and produce new coffee
in the cup.

237
00:15:09,098 --> 00:15:10,397
This way, I can give

238
00:15:10,434 --> 00:15:13,339
the illusion that I'm sharing
the dining experience.

239
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,346
Very thoughtful.

240
00:15:18,487 --> 00:15:23,591
Tell me, Odo, have you heard
any news from Cardassia lately?

241
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:25,865
Not since they sealed
their borders.

242
00:15:25,972 --> 00:15:29,435
Well, I have, and frankly,
I don't like what I've heard...

243
00:15:29,479 --> 00:15:31,848
rumors of uprising,
civil disturbance.

244
00:15:31,886 --> 00:15:33,355
It's all very alarming.

245
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:37,456
I didn't know you still had
friends inside the Empire.

246
00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:40,563
One or two, but I can't even
get through to them now.

247
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,041
That's what worries me.

248
00:15:42,077 --> 00:15:44,914
With the destruction
of the Obsidian Order

249
00:15:44,984 --> 00:15:47,080
and the threat of the Dominion

250
00:15:47,122 --> 00:15:50,528
these are unsettling times
for Cardassia.

251
00:15:50,564 --> 00:15:51,828
They're unsettling
for everyone...

252
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,200
Stop!
What are you doing here?

253
00:15:53,237 --> 00:15:55,265
Let me see that!

254
00:15:55,309 --> 00:15:58,111
But if I hear anything,
I'll let you know.

255
00:15:58,149 --> 00:15:59,949
I'd appreciate that, Constable.

256
00:15:59,986 --> 00:16:02,116
Excuse me for a moment.

257
00:16:02,158 --> 00:16:04,652
...so far away
from the Firelight Nebula.

258
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:07,227
So what is it that you
do on this station?

259
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:10,141
Can I help you?

260
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:13,913
<i>Lohd Zoss-lee chaw-KU</i>
<i>sohk jaTAL?</i>

261
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,652
Actually, I'm not sure
Constable Odo has a mother.

262
00:16:16,692 --> 00:16:20,463
Morn, I believe Ensign Saunders
was looking for you.

263
00:16:20,502 --> 00:16:23,270
Gentlemen, if you have
business on this Promenade

264
00:16:23,309 --> 00:16:24,938
I suggest you get on with it.

265
00:16:24,979 --> 00:16:26,813
I'd listen to him,
if I were you.

266
00:16:26,851 --> 00:16:30,793
I don't take orders
from shape-shifters

267
00:16:30,827 --> 00:16:33,595
or their Cardassian lapdogs.

268
00:16:33,633 --> 00:16:35,797
I may be a shape-shifter,
but I am also

269
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,776
Chief of Security
of this station

270
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:38,972
so either move along

271
00:16:39,047 --> 00:16:41,484
or you'll be continuing
this conversation

272
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,216
from inside a holding cell.

273
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:48,397
As long as you wear
that Bajoran uniform

274
00:16:48,436 --> 00:16:50,304
we're allies.

275
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,869
Make sure you never
take it off.

276
00:16:58,159 --> 00:16:59,993
I didn't know you spoke Klingon.

277
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:03,197
Oh, you'd be surprised
at the things you can learn

278
00:17:03,238 --> 00:17:05,141
when you're doing alterations.

279
00:17:19,376 --> 00:17:21,176
Well, let me guess...

280
00:17:21,215 --> 00:17:22,684
you're either lost

281
00:17:22,718 --> 00:17:26,022
or desperately searching
for a good tailor.

282
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:27,392
Guess again!

283
00:17:37,504 --> 00:17:39,566
I can't believe
you're not pressing charges.

284
00:17:39,609 --> 00:17:43,141
Constable Odo and Captain Sisko
expressed a similar concern.

285
00:17:43,184 --> 00:17:46,021
But really, Doctor,
there was no harm done.

286
00:17:46,057 --> 00:17:47,925
They broke seven
of your transverse ribs

287
00:17:47,962 --> 00:17:50,058
and fractured your clavicle.

288
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:52,004
Ah, but I got off
several cutting remarks

289
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:55,981
which no doubt did
serious damage to their egos.

290
00:17:56,015 --> 00:17:57,040
Garak, this isn't funny.

291
00:17:57,084 --> 00:17:58,052
I'm serious, Doctor.

292
00:17:58,086 --> 00:17:59,248
Thanks to your ministrations

293
00:17:59,356 --> 00:18:01,384
I am almost completely healed.

294
00:18:01,428 --> 00:18:05,871
But the damage I did to them
will last a lifetime.

295
00:18:05,905 --> 00:18:08,103
What I can't understand

296
00:18:08,144 --> 00:18:12,177
is their inexplicable
hostility toward me.

297
00:18:12,221 --> 00:18:14,158
Maligning Constable Odo
is one thing...

298
00:18:14,192 --> 00:18:15,661
after all, he's a changeling.

299
00:18:15,696 --> 00:18:18,099
The Klingons don't know
him as well as we do.

300
00:18:18,134 --> 00:18:22,099
But relations between the
Klingon and Cardassian Empires

301
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:24,810
have never been
anything but amicable.

302
00:18:24,851 --> 00:18:26,845
With the exception
of the Betreka Nebula Incident.

303
00:18:26,889 --> 00:18:29,360
A minor skirmish.

304
00:18:29,395 --> 00:18:31,024
It lasted 18 years.

305
00:18:31,065 --> 00:18:32,261
It was ages ago.

306
00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:37,040
Perhaps they decided
they just didn't like me.

307
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,379
Not like you?

308
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:39,716
Impossible.

309
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:41,484
You're right.

310
00:18:41,524 --> 00:18:44,987
As always, Doctor.

311
00:18:47,204 --> 00:18:51,077
They must have mistaken me
for someone else.

312
00:18:51,113 --> 00:18:53,584
The Klingon ships keep
cloaking and de-cloaking

313
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,887
so it's impossible
to get an exact count

314
00:18:55,925 --> 00:18:58,557
but so far, we've been
able to identify

315
00:18:58,599 --> 00:18:59,966
at least 20 different warships

316
00:19:00,002 --> 00:19:01,905
in the vicinity of the station.

317
00:19:01,939 --> 00:19:03,408
Captain, we're receiving

318
00:19:03,444 --> 00:19:06,281
a priority one distress call
from the Freighter <i>Xhosa.</i>

319
00:19:06,384 --> 00:19:07,648
Kasidy's ship?

320
00:19:07,687 --> 00:19:10,387
She left the station
an hour ago.

321
00:19:10,426 --> 00:19:12,294
Put her through.

322
00:19:13,968 --> 00:19:16,839
This is the Freighter <i>Xhosa</i>
to Deep Space 9.

323
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,208
We're under attack by...

324
00:19:25,496 --> 00:19:26,988
Her signal's been jammed.

325
00:19:27,034 --> 00:19:28,834
Get a fix on her location.

326
00:19:28,871 --> 00:19:30,808
Tell the crew on the <i>Defiant</i>
to man their stations.

327
00:19:30,842 --> 00:19:32,642
We'll meet you on the Bridge.

328
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,115
<i>Defiant.</i>

329
00:19:40,298 --> 00:19:42,462
Forward scanners
are detecting the <i>Xhosa</i>

330
00:19:42,503 --> 00:19:45,374
at bearing 017 mark 346.

331
00:19:45,444 --> 00:19:47,073
I'm picking up another ship.

332
00:19:47,115 --> 00:19:49,279
It's got a tractor beam
on the <i>Xhosa.</i>

333
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,983
On screen.

334
00:19:54,031 --> 00:19:55,523
A Klingon ship?

335
00:19:55,568 --> 00:19:57,402
I can't get through to Kasidy.

336
00:19:57,473 --> 00:19:59,067
They're still jamming
her communications.

337
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,138
Hail the Klingon vessel.

338
00:20:01,181 --> 00:20:04,052
This is Commander Kaybok
of the <i>M'Char.</i>

339
00:20:04,088 --> 00:20:05,751
What is it you want?

340
00:20:05,793 --> 00:20:07,422
I want to know
why you stopped that ship.

341
00:20:07,463 --> 00:20:08,727
We have orders

342
00:20:08,767 --> 00:20:12,003
to search all vessels attempting
to leave Bajoran space.

343
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,270
Search them for what?

344
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,609
For shape-shifters.

345
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:17,084
Each ship will be scanned,
its cargo searched

346
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,091
and its crew members
and passengers

347
00:20:19,124 --> 00:20:21,095
subjected to genetic testing.

348
00:20:21,129 --> 00:20:22,393
On whose authority?

349
00:20:22,432 --> 00:20:25,929
On the authority of Gowron
and the Klingon High Council.

350
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:28,138
The Klingon High Council
has no jurisdiction

351
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,672
over ships in Bajoran space.

352
00:20:29,716 --> 00:20:32,689
We assumed you would welcome
our assistance.

353
00:20:32,723 --> 00:20:35,491
Do you have any evidence
that there are changelings

354
00:20:35,564 --> 00:20:37,033
aboard this particular ship?

355
00:20:37,067 --> 00:20:40,633
How can we have evidence
until we conduct our tests?

356
00:20:40,677 --> 00:20:44,516
Commander, Bajoran law strictly
prohibits any unwarranted

357
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:47,683
search and seizure
of vessels in our territory.

358
00:20:47,726 --> 00:20:49,788
I have my orders.

359
00:20:52,238 --> 00:20:55,143
The Klingon ship has increased
power to its tractor beam.

360
00:20:55,178 --> 00:20:57,547
It looks like they're preparing
to board the <i>Xhosa.</i>

361
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,282
Major, raise shields.

362
00:21:00,323 --> 00:21:01,952
Power up the forward phasers.

363
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:04,227
See if that gets
their attention.

364
00:21:04,266 --> 00:21:05,234
Shields up.

365
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:07,901
Forward phasers standing by.

366
00:21:09,712 --> 00:21:11,341
They're still not releasing
the tractor beam.

367
00:21:13,889 --> 00:21:17,056
Fire a warning shot 200 meters
off their starboard bow.

368
00:21:17,096 --> 00:21:19,533
Yes, sir.

369
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,702
Commander Kaybok would
like to speak with you.

370
00:21:23,746 --> 00:21:25,375
Let's hear what he has to say.

371
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,946
Captain, this is outrageous!

372
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,289
I agree.

373
00:21:29,327 --> 00:21:31,092
But you leave me no choice.

374
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,759
You're violating Bajoran law.

375
00:21:32,801 --> 00:21:35,569
Now, I will ask you
one last time.

376
00:21:35,674 --> 00:21:37,577
Release that ship immediately.

377
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:38,978
We are your allies.

378
00:21:39,016 --> 00:21:42,479
Major, lock phasers
on <i>M'Char's</i> engines.

379
00:21:42,524 --> 00:21:44,495
Prepare to fire on my command.

380
00:21:44,529 --> 00:21:46,830
Phasers ready.

381
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,144
<i>K'trek im stram.</i>

382
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,048
Gowron will hear of this.

383
00:21:58,362 --> 00:22:00,856
I'm receiving a hail
from the <i>Xhosa.</i>

384
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:02,269
It's Captain Yates.

385
00:22:02,305 --> 00:22:04,367
Put her through.

386
00:22:05,446 --> 00:22:07,576
Captain, I don't know
what you said

387
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:10,420
to those Klingons
but it must have been good.

388
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:11,984
Is everyone all right?

389
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:16,198
Everyone is fine.

390
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:19,803
I'm glad to hear it.

391
00:22:19,847 --> 00:22:23,219
We'll keep you on sensors
as long as we can

392
00:22:23,255 --> 00:22:26,991
but I doubt the Klingons
will give you any more trouble.

393
00:22:27,031 --> 00:22:28,500
I appreciate that, Captain.

394
00:22:28,534 --> 00:22:30,630
I'll see you in about two weeks.

395
00:22:30,706 --> 00:22:32,734
You know where to find me.

396
00:22:43,003 --> 00:22:45,201
According
to our long-range sensors

397
00:22:45,242 --> 00:22:47,236
the Klingon task force
has withdrawn

398
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,217
to just outside
Bajoran territory.

399
00:22:49,251 --> 00:22:51,552
So now they're
in unclaimed space.

400
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:54,222
And if they decide
to continue searching ships...

401
00:22:54,263 --> 00:22:56,564
There's nothing
we can do about it.

402
00:22:56,602 --> 00:22:59,838
Unless they try to stop
a Federation or Bajoran vessel.

403
00:22:59,876 --> 00:23:01,847
Which so far, they haven't done.

404
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:05,185
Captain, General Martok
is here to see you.

405
00:23:05,223 --> 00:23:06,317
Send him in.

406
00:23:06,358 --> 00:23:07,348
Yes, sir.

407
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:10,364
Ah, General.

408
00:23:10,402 --> 00:23:11,564
We need to talk.

409
00:23:14,478 --> 00:23:16,209
<i>SOHK-vad.</i>

410
00:23:29,581 --> 00:23:31,381
It's Commander Kaybok's.

411
00:23:31,418 --> 00:23:33,218
Why did he give it to me?

412
00:23:33,257 --> 00:23:36,595
He's letting you know
Kaybok's dead.

413
00:23:36,632 --> 00:23:40,038
Martok probably had him
executed for disobeying orders.

414
00:23:40,072 --> 00:23:43,478
Which means,
our next confrontation

415
00:23:43,514 --> 00:23:47,752
with the Klingons
won't be resolved so easily.

416
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:50,423
Any suggestions, old man?

417
00:23:52,135 --> 00:23:53,764
The longer the Klingons are here

418
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:55,639
the worse things
are going to get.

419
00:23:55,677 --> 00:23:59,448
Whatever you decide to do,
you'd better do it soon.

420
00:23:59,485 --> 00:24:03,689
Curzon told me once
that, in the long run

421
00:24:03,729 --> 00:24:07,033
the only people who can
really handle the Klingons

422
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,440
are Klingons.

423
00:24:11,114 --> 00:24:13,244
Get me Starfleet Command.

424
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:40,187
Commander Worf.

425
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:42,757
Chief.
It has been a long time.

426
00:24:42,801 --> 00:24:43,769
Too long.

427
00:24:43,803 --> 00:24:44,793
Welcome aboard.

428
00:24:45,908 --> 00:24:48,141
Just what this station needs...

429
00:24:48,181 --> 00:24:49,878
another Klingon.

430
00:24:49,918 --> 00:24:50,908
Come on.

431
00:25:02,047 --> 00:25:04,815
Lieutenant Commander Worf
reporting for duty, sir.

432
00:25:07,561 --> 00:25:09,725
It's good to have you aboard,
Commander.

433
00:25:09,766 --> 00:25:11,235
Thank you, sir.

434
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,035
At ease, Mr. Worf.

435
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:18,386
I was sorry to hear
about the <i>Enterprise.</i>

436
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,117
She was a good ship.

437
00:25:20,157 --> 00:25:21,592
Yes, sir.

438
00:25:21,627 --> 00:25:24,395
I understand you've been
on extended leave.

439
00:25:24,434 --> 00:25:28,570
Yes, I have been visiting
the Klingon monastery on Boreth.

440
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:31,243
I found my discussions
with the clerics there

441
00:25:31,284 --> 00:25:32,753
to be most enlightening.

442
00:25:32,788 --> 00:25:33,950
Well, I hope you'll forgive me

443
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:35,791
for pulling you
away from your studies

444
00:25:35,828 --> 00:25:38,426
but I doubt that this assignment
will take very long.

445
00:25:38,468 --> 00:25:40,530
My leave was almost over, sir.

446
00:25:40,573 --> 00:25:43,843
Do you have any idea
where you'll be stationed next?

447
00:25:43,881 --> 00:25:46,615
I am considering resigning
my commission.

448
00:25:46,654 --> 00:25:48,055
Really?

449
00:25:48,091 --> 00:25:50,187
May I ask why?

450
00:25:53,371 --> 00:25:56,367
I have spent
most of my life among humans.

451
00:25:56,411 --> 00:25:59,681
It has not always been
easy for me.

452
00:26:01,623 --> 00:26:03,924
And since the destruction
of the <i>Enterprise</i>

453
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:06,696
it has become
even more difficult.

454
00:26:06,735 --> 00:26:10,198
I am no longer sure
I belong in this uniform.

455
00:26:13,552 --> 00:26:18,861
Mr. Worf, if I told you
we didn't need you here

456
00:26:18,898 --> 00:26:20,698
I'd be lying

457
00:26:20,736 --> 00:26:25,202
but if you don't want to take
this assignment, I'd understand.

458
00:26:25,246 --> 00:26:27,775
Thank you, sir,
but until I make my decision

459
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,414
I intend to do my duty.

460
00:26:29,457 --> 00:26:30,949
I'm glad to hear that.

461
00:26:30,994 --> 00:26:34,628
I assume you've read
my situation report.

462
00:26:34,669 --> 00:26:35,865
Yes, sir.

463
00:26:35,905 --> 00:26:38,172
I can't help but feel
that General Martok

464
00:26:38,211 --> 00:26:41,515
isn't telling the whole truth
about this Klingon task force.

465
00:26:41,619 --> 00:26:43,954
There are too many
unanswered questions.

466
00:26:43,991 --> 00:26:45,791
Then I will find you
some answers.

467
00:26:45,829 --> 00:26:46,854
Good.

468
00:26:46,899 --> 00:26:48,334
If you need any help,
let me know.

469
00:26:48,369 --> 00:26:50,100
Yes, sir.

470
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:53,407
Commander.

471
00:26:55,486 --> 00:26:59,724
I once thought about resigning
from Starfleet, too.

472
00:26:59,762 --> 00:27:02,826
I know if I had,
I would have regretted it.

473
00:27:04,107 --> 00:27:06,671
Don't make any quick decisions.

474
00:27:06,712 --> 00:27:10,016
I will keep that in mind.

475
00:27:25,157 --> 00:27:28,255
Let me guess...
Klingon bloodwine.

476
00:27:28,297 --> 00:27:29,960
Prune juice, chilled.

477
00:27:30,002 --> 00:27:31,665
Prune juice?

478
00:27:31,706 --> 00:27:34,304
I-if you say so.

479
00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:43,559
Commander, over here.

480
00:27:49,917 --> 00:27:53,619
Dr. Julian Bashir,
Lieutenant Commander Worf.

481
00:27:53,692 --> 00:27:55,423
Care for a game of darts?

482
00:27:55,462 --> 00:27:56,954
I do not play games.

483
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,632
It's like poker,
but with pointed tips.

484
00:28:01,276 --> 00:28:05,776
All right, think of it
as target practice.

485
00:28:05,821 --> 00:28:07,815
The object is to throw this dart

486
00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:09,955
and hit that board over there.

487
00:28:11,735 --> 00:28:13,329
Aim for the dot in the middle.

488
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:22,392
Well, you saw how he was acting!

489
00:28:22,427 --> 00:28:24,261
I can't believe you did that!

490
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:25,893
Well, he didn't
leave me any choice.

491
00:28:25,936 --> 00:28:27,030
Wait, wait, wait.

492
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:28,200
What did she do?

493
00:28:28,241 --> 00:28:30,109
She knocked out Lancelot.

494
00:28:30,146 --> 00:28:31,445
He kissed me.

495
00:28:31,483 --> 00:28:33,317
He's supposed to kiss you.

496
00:28:33,353 --> 00:28:34,617
But I was playing
a married woman.

497
00:28:34,657 --> 00:28:36,092
Uh, Lieutenant Commander Worf...

498
00:28:36,127 --> 00:28:39,225
this is Lieutenant
Commander Jadzia Dax

499
00:28:39,268 --> 00:28:41,136
and Major Kira Nerys...

500
00:28:41,172 --> 00:28:43,736
our First Officer.

501
00:28:45,784 --> 00:28:47,755
Nice hat.

502
00:28:53,268 --> 00:28:54,828
I, uh...

503
00:28:54,871 --> 00:28:57,708
I don't usually dress like this.

504
00:28:59,115 --> 00:29:01,086
We were in the holosuite.

505
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,384
So I gathered.

506
00:29:02,423 --> 00:29:05,659
You used to be Curzon Dax.

507
00:29:05,732 --> 00:29:09,571
That's right, and I don't
usually dress like this either.

508
00:29:09,607 --> 00:29:13,343
Curzon's name is an honored one
among my people.

509
00:29:13,383 --> 00:29:16,151
<i>Louk, a jeek CHIM-ta law.</i>

510
00:29:20,233 --> 00:29:22,967
I suppose so.

511
00:29:23,006 --> 00:29:24,134
Bartender!

512
00:29:25,178 --> 00:29:26,875
Bloodwine!

513
00:29:26,915 --> 00:29:28,282
And hurry!

514
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:33,153
Excuse me.

515
00:29:33,197 --> 00:29:36,170
What did you say to him?

516
00:29:36,204 --> 00:29:40,738
It loses something
in the translation.

517
00:29:40,816 --> 00:29:42,753
This bloodwine is cold!

518
00:29:42,854 --> 00:29:44,585
Get me another one!

519
00:29:44,624 --> 00:29:48,964
You are Drex, son of Martok.

520
00:29:51,475 --> 00:29:53,240
That's right.

521
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:55,910
I am Worf, son of Mogh.

522
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:13,925
He's good.

523
00:30:13,961 --> 00:30:16,125
What did I tell you?

524
00:30:36,415 --> 00:30:37,907
Enter.

525
00:30:40,725 --> 00:30:43,289
I have come
for my son's <i>d'k tahg.</i>

526
00:30:43,332 --> 00:30:46,305
Give it to me...
or I will take it from you.

527
00:30:46,339 --> 00:30:49,575
Now that you are here...

528
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:54,556
I have no further need of it.

529
00:30:56,530 --> 00:31:01,406
You robbed my son of his honor
just to get my attention?

530
00:31:01,441 --> 00:31:04,882
You cannot take away
what someone does not have.

531
00:31:04,916 --> 00:31:06,476
You're saying my son
is without honor.

532
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,288
I am saying your son
is a coward and a liar.

533
00:31:09,327 --> 00:31:10,626
And what of his father?

534
00:31:11,933 --> 00:31:14,131
That remains to be seen.

535
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:20,450
Tell me, what have I done
to earn your disrespect?

536
00:31:20,487 --> 00:31:24,326
The misdeeds your troops have
committed speak for themselves...

537
00:31:24,363 --> 00:31:27,393
attacking a Cardassian tailor

538
00:31:27,438 --> 00:31:30,502
detaining and searching ships
in neutral space without warning

539
00:31:30,545 --> 00:31:34,954
or provocation... and you
executing one of your Commanders

540
00:31:35,022 --> 00:31:38,724
because he refused
to fire on a Federation ship.

541
00:31:38,765 --> 00:31:39,961
Whatever we have done

542
00:31:40,067 --> 00:31:42,869
is in the best interest
of the Alpha Quadrant.

543
00:31:42,907 --> 00:31:45,573
You must think me a fool to make
your lies so transparent.

544
00:31:47,284 --> 00:31:50,189
I do not wish to quarrel
with you, Worf.

545
00:31:50,226 --> 00:31:52,288
Nor I with you.

546
00:31:52,331 --> 00:31:55,463
The House of Martok
is an honored one

547
00:31:55,505 --> 00:31:56,997
with a proud tradition

548
00:31:57,075 --> 00:31:59,444
but I must know
why you are here.

549
00:31:59,481 --> 00:32:03,320
I am here under the authority
of Gowron himself.

550
00:32:03,357 --> 00:32:05,453
I am carrying out his orders.

551
00:32:05,495 --> 00:32:07,398
That should be
all the explanation

552
00:32:07,433 --> 00:32:08,834
a Klingon warrior needs.

553
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:12,903
You forget,
I am not only a Klingon warrior

554
00:32:12,946 --> 00:32:14,849
I am a Starfleet officer

555
00:32:14,884 --> 00:32:17,151
and Starfleet deserves
an explanation.

556
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:20,357
They will get one soon enough.

557
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:24,807
Until then, know this:

558
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:28,841
My mission will determine

559
00:32:28,885 --> 00:32:31,118
the fate
of the Klingon Empire.

560
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:36,158
Interfere, and you risk
destroying us all.

561
00:33:04,877 --> 00:33:07,212
You shouldn't drop
your left arm like that.

562
00:33:07,249 --> 00:33:10,154
I do not remember
asking you for advice.

563
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:11,556
I'm just trying to help.

564
00:33:21,049 --> 00:33:23,179
So, how did you
like the program?

565
00:33:23,221 --> 00:33:24,781
I found it adequate

566
00:33:24,825 --> 00:33:27,126
although I was surprised to find

567
00:33:27,163 --> 00:33:30,433
a Klingon exercise program
on the holosuite.

568
00:33:30,472 --> 00:33:31,371
It's mine.

569
00:33:31,407 --> 00:33:33,036
You mean Curzon's.

570
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:35,105
No. I mean it's mine.

571
00:33:35,149 --> 00:33:37,552
Computer, <i>bat'leth.</i>

572
00:33:37,589 --> 00:33:41,531
I thought you might be tired
of fighting holograms.

573
00:33:41,565 --> 00:33:43,593
It would not be a fair match.

574
00:33:46,543 --> 00:33:48,274
I'll go easy on you.

575
00:33:48,315 --> 00:33:49,944
Very well.

576
00:33:52,592 --> 00:33:54,289
Defend yourself.

577
00:34:05,188 --> 00:34:07,159
I hope you're not holding back
because I'm a woman.

578
00:34:07,193 --> 00:34:09,130
If it makes things any easier,
think of me as a man.

579
00:34:09,164 --> 00:34:11,192
I've been one several times.

580
00:34:25,804 --> 00:34:27,535
Feel better?

581
00:34:29,212 --> 00:34:30,613
I take it your conversation

582
00:34:30,649 --> 00:34:33,086
with General Martok
didn't go all that well.

583
00:34:33,121 --> 00:34:36,892
He was not forthcoming,
and he is not the only one.

584
00:34:38,301 --> 00:34:41,901
I tried to contact
Gowron, Emperor Kahless

585
00:34:41,943 --> 00:34:44,039
even my brother,
who sits on the High Council.

586
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,312
No one will speak with me.

587
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,719
Maybe you're going about this
the wrong way.

588
00:34:47,757 --> 00:34:49,158
With so many Klingons around

589
00:34:49,194 --> 00:34:51,758
there must be someone
who owes your family a favor.

590
00:34:56,678 --> 00:35:00,380
<i>Ej IM-ta fey DE-ja i

591
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:04,419
<i>ejadahk-so-TAS</i>
<i>ghos va Skral byteek</i>

592
00:35:04,463 --> 00:35:08,268
<i>Empa jaj law-moch jaj-pusH</i>

593
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:14,652
<i>jaj Kayless Molor-migh</i>
<i>hohk-chew koo.</i>

594
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:22,662
Your father and I
used to sing that song

595
00:35:22,707 --> 00:35:25,680
when you were just a small boy.

596
00:35:25,714 --> 00:35:30,089
Did I ever tell you how your
father saved my family's honor

597
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:33,588
during our blood feud
with the House of Duras?

598
00:35:33,633 --> 00:35:34,966
Many times.

599
00:35:35,003 --> 00:35:36,997
It is a good story.

600
00:35:37,042 --> 00:35:39,036
Yes, and you tell it well.

601
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,076
Your father was a great warrior.

602
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:45,492
My family owes him
everything we have.

603
00:35:45,529 --> 00:35:50,530
I wish there was some way
I could repay him.

604
00:35:52,846 --> 00:35:54,908
There is.

605
00:35:54,951 --> 00:35:57,149
Tell me why the task force
is here

606
00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:00,892
the real reason, not the one
Martok gave the Federation.

607
00:36:00,932 --> 00:36:03,369
The real reason?

608
00:36:03,405 --> 00:36:07,472
I suppose you have
a right to know.

609
00:36:07,514 --> 00:36:09,610
You are a Klingon warrior

610
00:36:09,653 --> 00:36:13,595
and it would be wrong
to keep you away from battle.

611
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:20,271
And it's going to be
a glorious battle.

612
00:36:34,245 --> 00:36:37,549
It all seems simpler
from up here, doesn't it?

613
00:36:40,661 --> 00:36:43,132
If you are looking
to start a conversation

614
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:44,396
look somewhere else.

615
00:36:44,436 --> 00:36:46,669
I would prefer to be left alone.

616
00:36:46,708 --> 00:36:50,844
That may be, but you
can't stay up here forever.

617
00:36:50,885 --> 00:36:54,121
Sooner or later, you're going to
have to talk to Captain Sisko.

618
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:56,927
Whatever it is you've found out
about the Klingons

619
00:36:56,966 --> 00:36:58,367
he should be the first to know.

620
00:36:58,403 --> 00:37:01,433
You have been spying on me.

621
00:37:01,477 --> 00:37:03,505
As Chief of Security

622
00:37:03,549 --> 00:37:07,456
it's my duty to observe
the inhabitants of this station.

623
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:12,093
Since your arrival,
you've transmitted an average

624
00:37:12,136 --> 00:37:14,403
of five messages a day
to the Klingon Homeworld.

625
00:37:14,442 --> 00:37:17,540
None of which
has gotten a response.

626
00:37:17,582 --> 00:37:21,353
Then last night, you met

627
00:37:21,392 --> 00:37:23,795
with a Klingon officer
in your quarters.

628
00:37:23,831 --> 00:37:25,995
Since then, you haven't
sent a single message.

629
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:27,335
In fact, you've done nothing

630
00:37:27,372 --> 00:37:29,468
to further your investigation
of the Klingon task force.

631
00:37:29,511 --> 00:37:31,641
None of which is your business.

632
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:35,146
The security of this station
is my business.

633
00:37:35,191 --> 00:37:37,720
Your behavior
leads me to conclude

634
00:37:37,763 --> 00:37:40,668
that either you've given up
your investigation

635
00:37:40,705 --> 00:37:43,269
in which case,
it's my duty to take over

636
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:46,648
or... you found something...

637
00:37:46,685 --> 00:37:50,023
something so disturbing
that you're hesitant

638
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,654
to inform Captain Sisko.

639
00:37:54,571 --> 00:37:59,207
I am not interested
in your... conclusions.

640
00:37:59,248 --> 00:38:00,342
Commander?

641
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,594
I just wanted to say
that I understand

642
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,577
what you're going through.

643
00:38:11,612 --> 00:38:13,913
I've also had to choose
between duty

644
00:38:13,951 --> 00:38:15,511
and loyalty to my people.

645
00:38:15,554 --> 00:38:18,322
Yes. I've read
your Starfleet security file.

646
00:38:18,361 --> 00:38:23,271
Frankly, Mr. Worf, I don't care
which choice you make

647
00:38:23,306 --> 00:38:25,800
but you owe it to Captain Sisko
to let him know

648
00:38:25,846 --> 00:38:29,082
which side you're on,
before it's too late.

649
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:32,794
Enjoy the view.

650
00:38:45,025 --> 00:38:47,496
Mr. Worf, what can I do for you?

651
00:38:47,531 --> 00:38:50,129
Where is Captain Sisko?

652
00:38:50,238 --> 00:38:52,436
I think he's
in a briefing session with...

653
00:38:52,476 --> 00:38:54,743
I need to talk to him now.

654
00:38:54,782 --> 00:38:56,012
Cardassia?

655
00:38:56,052 --> 00:38:58,889
Why would the Klingons
want to invade Cardassia?

656
00:38:58,925 --> 00:39:00,087
According to my source

657
00:39:00,128 --> 00:39:02,999
there has been an uprising
on the Cardassian homeworld.

658
00:39:03,035 --> 00:39:05,029
The Central Command
has been overthrown

659
00:39:05,074 --> 00:39:07,477
and power transferred
to civilian authorities.

660
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:09,004
Even if your source is correct

661
00:39:09,049 --> 00:39:11,282
what does that have to do
with the Klingons?

662
00:39:11,321 --> 00:39:13,383
Gowron and the High
Council believe the coup

663
00:39:13,426 --> 00:39:14,895
was engineered by the Dominion.

664
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:16,126
Do they have any proof?

665
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,137
None that I know of,
but they are convinced

666
00:39:18,171 --> 00:39:19,868
that civilians
could not have overthrown

667
00:39:19,908 --> 00:39:21,309
the Central Command
without help.

668
00:39:21,345 --> 00:39:25,081
So, by attacking Cardassia,
they think they're protecting

669
00:39:25,122 --> 00:39:28,756
the Alpha Quadrant
from the Dominion.

670
00:39:28,797 --> 00:39:29,822
Sisko to Dax.

671
00:39:29,866 --> 00:39:31,700
Contact General Martok.

672
00:39:31,737 --> 00:39:33,901
Tell him I need
to meet with him immediately.

673
00:39:33,942 --> 00:39:35,377
Yes, sir.

674
00:39:35,413 --> 00:39:37,407
Hmm.

675
00:39:41,728 --> 00:39:46,536
Mr. Worf, I know this hasn't
been an easy assignment for you.

676
00:39:46,573 --> 00:39:48,737
No, it has not.

677
00:39:50,182 --> 00:39:51,674
But I knew this day
would come again

678
00:39:51,718 --> 00:39:52,880
when I'd be forced to choose

679
00:39:52,921 --> 00:39:55,485
between the Federation
and the Klingon Empire.

680
00:39:55,527 --> 00:39:59,833
Maybe you don't have
to make that choice just yet.

681
00:39:59,871 --> 00:40:01,899
I don't think there's any need

682
00:40:01,943 --> 00:40:04,939
for you to be there
when I meet with Martok.

683
00:40:04,983 --> 00:40:06,714
I would prefer to be there.

684
00:40:06,754 --> 00:40:10,422
I cannot avoid responsibility
for what I have done today.

685
00:40:15,308 --> 00:40:19,147
I must compliment you on your
intelligence network, Captain.

686
00:40:19,184 --> 00:40:22,647
One day, you must tell me
how you learned of our plans.

687
00:40:22,692 --> 00:40:23,660
General!

688
00:40:23,694 --> 00:40:25,995
How I got the information
isn't important.

689
00:40:26,034 --> 00:40:29,030
I think it is,
and so will Gowron.

690
00:40:29,074 --> 00:40:32,879
General, I want you
to call off this attack.

691
00:40:32,917 --> 00:40:35,685
And what do you propose
we do instead?

692
00:40:35,723 --> 00:40:39,528
Stand by and allow the Dominion
to take over the Alpha Quadrant?

693
00:40:39,567 --> 00:40:42,563
You have no proof that there are
any Founders on Cardassia.

694
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:45,238
The change in government
is all the proof we need.

695
00:40:45,371 --> 00:40:46,704
And what if you are wrong?

696
00:40:46,741 --> 00:40:50,774
That would be unfortunate...
for the Cardassians.

697
00:40:50,817 --> 00:40:54,759
General, the Federation Council
has made it clear to me

698
00:40:54,794 --> 00:40:57,858
that they cannot support
your plans to attack Cardassia.

699
00:40:59,438 --> 00:41:02,138
Are you saying the Federation
will sit back and do nothing

700
00:41:02,178 --> 00:41:04,342
while Klingon soldiers
give their lives

701
00:41:04,383 --> 00:41:06,114
to protect the Alpha Quadrant?

702
00:41:06,154 --> 00:41:09,492
Starfleet will not participate
in an unprovoked invasion.

703
00:41:09,529 --> 00:41:12,559
Then the victory
will be ours alone!

704
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:16,545
General, I would advise you
to reconsider.

705
00:41:16,579 --> 00:41:19,108
The Federation Council
has informed Gowron

706
00:41:19,152 --> 00:41:23,492
that if the attack goes forward,
it will jeopardize our treaty

707
00:41:23,529 --> 00:41:26,093
with the Klingon Empire.

708
00:41:26,136 --> 00:41:32,243
Believe me, Captain, we have no
wish to antagonize your people.

709
00:41:32,283 --> 00:41:34,777
Then call off the attack.

710
00:41:37,463 --> 00:41:39,661
I will consult with Gowron.

711
00:41:39,701 --> 00:41:42,503
You will have his decision
within the hour.

712
00:42:02,523 --> 00:42:05,155
Captain, I think
you better take a look at this.

713
00:42:08,035 --> 00:42:09,664
Report.

714
00:42:09,707 --> 00:42:12,339
As soon as General Martok
beamed back to his ship

715
00:42:12,379 --> 00:42:14,441
he sent a message
to the Klingon fleet.

716
00:42:14,484 --> 00:42:16,978
It was just one word... <i>"In'Cha."</i>

717
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:20,195
"Begin."

718
00:42:20,231 --> 00:42:22,293
I'm picking up
a huge distortion wave

719
00:42:22,336 --> 00:42:23,600
in subspace.

720
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,668
The Klingon ships
are going to warp.

721
00:42:25,711 --> 00:42:27,305
Can you plot their course?

722
00:42:27,348 --> 00:42:29,251
Judging from the vector
on the subspace disturbance

723
00:42:29,287 --> 00:42:34,699
I'd say their heading is...
269 mark 032.

724
00:42:34,733 --> 00:42:37,729
Straight
to the Cardassian Empire.

725
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:51,035
The Federation Council has been
trying to contact Gowron.

726
00:42:51,106 --> 00:42:53,373
So far they've had no response.

727
00:42:53,411 --> 00:42:56,009
So until they've had a chance
to speak with him

728
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:58,453
we've been ordered
not to get involved.

729
00:42:58,490 --> 00:42:59,925
The Bajoran government
has agreed

730
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,592
to abide by the decisions
of the Federation Council.

731
00:43:02,634 --> 00:43:04,935
So that means we're not going
to warn the Cardassians?

732
00:43:04,972 --> 00:43:06,806
The Klingons are
still our allies.

733
00:43:06,844 --> 00:43:09,840
If we warn the Cardassians,
we'd be betraying them.

734
00:43:09,884 --> 00:43:12,982
Besides, what if the Klingons
are right?

735
00:43:13,025 --> 00:43:14,119
What if the Dominion

736
00:43:14,161 --> 00:43:16,462
has taken over
the Cardassian government?

737
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:19,770
If my people wanted to seize
control of Cardassia

738
00:43:19,808 --> 00:43:21,608
that is how they would do it.

739
00:43:21,645 --> 00:43:22,944
The coup could have happened

740
00:43:22,982 --> 00:43:24,679
just as easily
without the Founders.

741
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,189
The Cardassian
dissident movement

742
00:43:26,223 --> 00:43:27,852
has been gaining strength
for years.

743
00:43:27,894 --> 00:43:29,363
With the Obsidian Order
out of the way

744
00:43:29,397 --> 00:43:31,561
they might have
finally succeeded.

745
00:43:31,602 --> 00:43:32,969
The issue is not

746
00:43:33,006 --> 00:43:36,036
if there are any Founders
on Cardassia.

747
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,242
There are many Klingons

748
00:43:37,283 --> 00:43:39,254
who say we have been
at peace too long

749
00:43:39,288 --> 00:43:41,920
that the Empire must expand
in order to survive.

750
00:43:41,961 --> 00:43:44,866
Fear of the Dominion
has given my people an excuse

751
00:43:44,901 --> 00:43:46,530
to do what they were born
to do...

752
00:43:46,572 --> 00:43:48,702
to fight and to conquer.

753
00:43:48,744 --> 00:43:50,806
If they're so eager to fight

754
00:43:50,849 --> 00:43:53,720
who's to say they'll stop
with the Cardassians?

755
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:56,456
Next target could be anyone,
even the Federation.

756
00:43:56,496 --> 00:43:59,162
If I were you,
I'd be more worried about Bajor.

757
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:01,366
Think about it.

758
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:03,605
What good would it do
the Klingons to defeat

759
00:44:03,646 --> 00:44:05,913
Cardassia if they don't
control the wormhole?

760
00:44:05,951 --> 00:44:07,443
Agreed.

761
00:44:07,488 --> 00:44:11,931
If my people return to the
old ways, no one will be safe.

762
00:44:11,966 --> 00:44:14,530
Then we'll have to make sure
that doesn't happen.

763
00:44:14,572 --> 00:44:15,905
But how?

764
00:44:15,942 --> 00:44:18,540
The way I see it,
we only have two choices.

765
00:44:18,582 --> 00:44:19,812
Both of them bad.

766
00:44:19,852 --> 00:44:21,948
If we stand by and do nothing

767
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:24,861
we run the risk of being
the Klingons' next target.

768
00:44:24,897 --> 00:44:27,768
But if we disobey Starfleet
orders and warn the Cardassians

769
00:44:27,804 --> 00:44:30,470
we may end up starting
a war with the Klingons.

770
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:34,246
Which means...
we need a third option.

771
00:44:39,432 --> 00:44:41,630
Trust me, you won't regret this.

772
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:43,162
When it comes to keeping warm

773
00:44:43,241 --> 00:44:44,904
nothing beats
Vitarian wool undergarments.

774
00:44:44,945 --> 00:44:47,075
And in case you change your mind
about those earmuffs

775
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:48,643
I'll keep them on hold for you.

776
00:44:51,026 --> 00:44:55,401
Mr. Garak, I'd like to see you
in the Wardroom immediately.

777
00:44:55,436 --> 00:44:56,962
Bring your tailor's kit.

778
00:44:59,179 --> 00:45:02,311
All together, we're talking
about well over a hundred ships

779
00:45:02,353 --> 00:45:03,652
just in the first wave.

780
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:05,125
Excuse me.

781
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,356
I hope I'm not interrupting.

782
00:45:06,397 --> 00:45:08,128
I'd like to be measured
for a new suit.

783
00:45:08,167 --> 00:45:09,135
Now?

784
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:10,160
Right now.

785
00:45:10,205 --> 00:45:11,868
But, Captain, I do have
your measurements.

786
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:12,877
Take them again.

787
00:45:12,912 --> 00:45:15,008
You were saying, Commander?

788
00:45:15,051 --> 00:45:17,649
I was saying that between
ground forces and warships

789
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:18,920
the Klingons have committed

790
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,492
almost a third of their
military to this invasion.

791
00:45:22,535 --> 00:45:24,004
How long before they reach
their target?

792
00:45:25,943 --> 00:45:27,139
According to our estimates

793
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,308
the task force should enter

794
00:45:28,349 --> 00:45:29,784
Cardassian space
within the hour.

795
00:45:29,819 --> 00:45:31,083
Don't forget the waist.

796
00:45:31,122 --> 00:45:33,150
I think I've lost
a little weight.

797
00:45:33,194 --> 00:45:34,788
Well, thank you, Captain.

798
00:45:34,831 --> 00:45:37,234
I believe
I have everything I need.

799
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:45,647
The Klingons?

800
00:45:45,691 --> 00:45:48,255
Why would the Klingons
invade us?

801
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:50,894
According to my sources, the
Klingon High Council believes

802
00:45:50,936 --> 00:45:53,602
that Cardassia has been
taken over by the Founders.

803
00:45:53,643 --> 00:45:55,408
That's ridiculous.

804
00:45:55,447 --> 00:45:57,178
Is it?

805
00:45:57,218 --> 00:45:59,280
Garak, you have got
to talk to Sisko.

806
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:02,957
Tell him he has to find some way
to stop the Klingons.

807
00:46:02,999 --> 00:46:05,836
Cardassia has enough
problems right now.

808
00:46:05,872 --> 00:46:08,845
Having trouble
keeping the civilians in line?

809
00:46:08,879 --> 00:46:11,443
How do you know about that?

810
00:46:11,486 --> 00:46:14,391
I'm afraid that since the fall
of the Obsidian Order

811
00:46:14,426 --> 00:46:17,126
Cardassian security
isn't what it used to be.

812
00:46:17,166 --> 00:46:19,137
Yes.

813
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:21,505
Shame about the Order.

814
00:46:21,543 --> 00:46:25,279
I suppose there won't be
much demand

815
00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:28,121
for your services anymore.

816
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:30,961
Looks like you'll be
hemming women's dresses

817
00:46:30,999 --> 00:46:33,300
for the rest of your life.

818
00:46:33,404 --> 00:46:36,036
We can stand here all day
reminding ourselves

819
00:46:36,078 --> 00:46:37,981
just how much we hate each other

820
00:46:38,016 --> 00:46:39,953
but you don't have the time.

821
00:46:39,988 --> 00:46:42,459
The Klingon fleet will reach
Cardassian territory

822
00:46:42,493 --> 00:46:44,760
in less than one hour.

823
00:46:44,798 --> 00:46:46,735
I suggest you prepare for them.

824
00:46:53,921 --> 00:46:55,892
Based on Klingon transmissions

825
00:46:55,926 --> 00:46:58,922
we've intercepted,
the outlying Cardassian colonies

826
00:46:58,966 --> 00:47:01,130
were overrun almost immediately.

827
00:47:01,171 --> 00:47:03,803
But now that the Cardassian
fleet has mobilized

828
00:47:03,844 --> 00:47:05,781
the Klingons are meeting
stronger resistance.

829
00:47:05,816 --> 00:47:07,217
You'd almost think
somebody warned

830
00:47:07,253 --> 00:47:08,620
the Cardassians
they were coming.

831
00:47:08,656 --> 00:47:10,524
Hopefully, it'll make
the Klingons

832
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,189
think twice
about what they're doing.

833
00:47:12,232 --> 00:47:13,963
Unlikely, Major.

834
00:47:14,002 --> 00:47:16,439
Now that the battle has begun,
Martok and his troops

835
00:47:16,475 --> 00:47:18,503
will settle for nothing
less than victory.

836
00:47:26,164 --> 00:47:27,189
Well...

837
00:47:27,234 --> 00:47:29,068
what did the Federation Council
say?

838
00:47:29,105 --> 00:47:32,078
They've decided to condemn
the Klingon invasion.

839
00:47:32,112 --> 00:47:36,054
In response...
Gowron has expelled

840
00:47:36,088 --> 00:47:38,856
all Federation citizens
from the Klingon Empire

841
00:47:38,895 --> 00:47:42,096
and recalled his Ambassadors
from the Federation.

842
00:47:42,136 --> 00:47:44,539
You're saying he cut off
diplomatic relations?

843
00:47:44,575 --> 00:47:46,876
He's done more than that.

844
00:47:46,914 --> 00:47:51,550
The Klingons have withdrawn
from the Khitomer Accords.

845
00:47:51,592 --> 00:47:54,394
The peace treaty
between the Federation

846
00:47:54,433 --> 00:47:57,429
and the Klingon Empire
has ended.

847
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:58,530
Captain.

848
00:48:00,012 --> 00:48:01,538
You're never going
to believe this.

849
00:48:01,583 --> 00:48:05,115
A Klingon ship just de-cloaked
off Upper Pylon 3

850
00:48:05,158 --> 00:48:07,095
and is requesting
permission to dock.

851
00:48:07,129 --> 00:48:10,831
They claim they have
Chancellor Gowron on board

852
00:48:10,872 --> 00:48:13,572
and he is demanding
to speak with Mr. Worf...

853
00:48:13,611 --> 00:48:15,732
personally.

854
00:48:23,919 --> 00:48:25,890
Chancellor Gowron.

855
00:48:25,924 --> 00:48:27,416
You wished to speak with me?

856
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:29,431
Worf.

857
00:48:29,465 --> 00:48:32,769
Worf!

858
00:48:32,806 --> 00:48:35,039
It is good to see you.

859
00:48:35,111 --> 00:48:36,307
I always said that uniform

860
00:48:36,348 --> 00:48:37,942
would get you
into trouble one day.

861
00:48:37,985 --> 00:48:40,822
It seems you were right

862
00:48:40,859 --> 00:48:42,488
but I do not apologize for my...

863
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:44,899
Yes, yes, I know.

864
00:48:44,935 --> 00:48:46,963
You did what you thought
was right.

865
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,444
And even though you may
have made some enemies

866
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:52,180
I assure you, ha,
I am not one of them.

867
00:48:52,219 --> 00:48:54,417
I am glad.

868
00:48:54,458 --> 00:48:56,292
Your friendship
means much to me.

869
00:48:56,329 --> 00:48:57,593
And yours to me.

870
00:48:57,633 --> 00:49:01,575
It has been too long since
you last fought at my side.

871
00:49:01,608 --> 00:49:04,274
Now the time has come again.

872
00:49:04,315 --> 00:49:07,653
We will do great deeds
in the coming days.

873
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:10,720
Deeds worthy of song!

874
00:49:10,764 --> 00:49:14,205
You want me to go
to Cardassia with you?

875
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:16,710
What better way
to redeem yourself

876
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:18,716
in the eyes of your people?

877
00:49:18,749 --> 00:49:20,777
Come with me, Worf.

878
00:49:20,821 --> 00:49:24,523
Glory awaits you on Cardassia.

879
00:49:34,655 --> 00:49:38,255
Worf, why do you stand there
like a mute <i>d'blok?</i>

880
00:49:38,297 --> 00:49:40,268
I have offered you
a chance for glory.

881
00:49:40,302 --> 00:49:41,931
All you have to do is take it.

882
00:49:42,941 --> 00:49:45,242
If there's any glory
to be won, Gowron

883
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,114
it'll have to be yours alone.

884
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:48,916
I cannot come with you.

885
00:49:48,956 --> 00:49:51,018
Of course you can.

886
00:49:51,061 --> 00:49:53,157
It is where you belong.

887
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:56,172
I cannot abandon my post.

888
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,766
You no longer have a post.

889
00:49:57,810 --> 00:49:59,336
You have no place
on that station

890
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:01,180
and no business
wearing that uniform.

891
00:50:01,252 --> 00:50:03,017
I have sworn
an oath of allegiance.

892
00:50:03,056 --> 00:50:04,115
To the Federation!

893
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:06,187
You would have me
break my word?

894
00:50:06,264 --> 00:50:07,927
Your word?

895
00:50:07,967 --> 00:50:09,129
What good is your word

896
00:50:09,171 --> 00:50:11,574
when you give it to people
who care nothing for honor?

897
00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:13,203
Who refuse to lift a finger

898
00:50:13,247 --> 00:50:16,551
while Klingon warriors
shed blood for their protection?

899
00:50:16,588 --> 00:50:19,390
I tell you,
they are without honor

900
00:50:19,428 --> 00:50:22,664
and you do not
owe them anything!

901
00:50:22,703 --> 00:50:24,867
It is not what I owe them
that matters.

902
00:50:24,908 --> 00:50:26,241
It is what I owe myself.

903
00:50:26,345 --> 00:50:28,839
Worf, son of Mogh,
does not break his word.

904
00:50:28,885 --> 00:50:30,822
And what of your debt to me?

905
00:50:30,856 --> 00:50:32,656
Are you saying
you owe me nothing?

906
00:50:32,694 --> 00:50:34,892
I gave you back your name,
restored your house

907
00:50:34,932 --> 00:50:36,960
gave your family a seat
on the High Council

908
00:50:37,004 --> 00:50:38,439
and this is how you repay me?

909
00:50:38,474 --> 00:50:39,464
It is true.

910
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:41,104
I owe you a great debt.

911
00:50:41,148 --> 00:50:44,611
I would give up my life for you.

912
00:50:44,656 --> 00:50:47,720
But invading Cardassia is wrong,
and I cannot support it.

913
00:50:47,763 --> 00:50:51,295
Worf... I have
always considered you

914
00:50:51,372 --> 00:50:53,434
a friend and an ally.

915
00:50:53,477 --> 00:50:55,914
And because you are my friend

916
00:50:55,949 --> 00:51:01,520
I am giving you this one
last chance to redeem yourself.

917
00:51:01,563 --> 00:51:03,591
Come with me.

918
00:51:05,372 --> 00:51:07,035
I cannot.

919
00:51:08,846 --> 00:51:11,215
Think about what you are doing.

920
00:51:11,253 --> 00:51:14,226
If you turn your back on me now

921
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:17,928
for as long as I live,
you will not be welcome

922
00:51:17,969 --> 00:51:20,270
anywhere in the Klingon Empire.

923
00:51:20,307 --> 00:51:24,043
Your family will be removed
from the High Council

924
00:51:24,084 --> 00:51:28,424
your lands seized and your House
stripped of its titles!

925
00:51:28,461 --> 00:51:30,329
You will have nothing!

926
00:51:33,506 --> 00:51:35,875
Except my honor.

927
00:51:39,053 --> 00:51:41,024
So be it.

928
00:51:54,924 --> 00:51:57,088
- Dabo!
- Dabo!

929
00:52:11,664 --> 00:52:13,897
You look like you could
use some company.

930
00:52:23,559 --> 00:52:26,726
Chief, do you remember the time

931
00:52:26,767 --> 00:52:29,102
we rescued Captain Picard
from the Borg?

932
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:31,407
How could I forget?

933
00:52:31,445 --> 00:52:33,974
It was touch and go there
for a while.

934
00:52:34,017 --> 00:52:35,988
There were a couple of moments

935
00:52:36,022 --> 00:52:39,758
when I thought we were all going
to wind up being "assimilated."

936
00:52:39,799 --> 00:52:41,929
Well, I never doubted
the outcome.

937
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:45,240
We were like... warriors
from the ancient sagas.

938
00:52:45,278 --> 00:52:47,613
There was nothing
we could not do.

939
00:52:47,651 --> 00:52:50,145
Except keep the holodecks
working right.

940
00:52:56,872 --> 00:53:00,711
I... have decided
to resign from Starfleet.

941
00:53:00,748 --> 00:53:03,049
Resign?

942
00:53:03,087 --> 00:53:04,852
What are you talking about?

943
00:53:04,892 --> 00:53:06,795
I have made up my mind.

944
00:53:06,829 --> 00:53:08,389
It is for the best.

945
00:53:08,434 --> 00:53:12,205
Look, I-I know how much
you miss the <i>Enterprise</i>

946
00:53:12,243 --> 00:53:15,444
but I'm sure they'll be
building a new one soon.

947
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:17,009
It will not be the same.

948
00:53:17,054 --> 00:53:19,184
The <i>Enterprise</i> I knew is gone.

949
00:53:19,226 --> 00:53:22,462
Now those were good years.

950
00:53:22,567 --> 00:53:25,061
But now it is time
for me to move on.

951
00:53:25,107 --> 00:53:26,235
And do what?

952
00:53:30,854 --> 00:53:32,950
I do not know.

953
00:53:32,992 --> 00:53:35,692
I thought I would be returning
to Boreth

954
00:53:35,732 --> 00:53:37,600
but now that is impossible.

955
00:53:37,636 --> 00:53:39,470
I have made an enemy of Gowron

956
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:41,809
and every other Klingon
in the Empire.

957
00:53:41,846 --> 00:53:44,785
All the more reason
to stay in Starfleet.

958
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:47,314
This uniform will only serve
to remind me

959
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:50,823
of how I have disgraced myself
in the eyes of my people.

960
00:53:50,868 --> 00:53:55,972
I suppose I could get a berth
on a Nyberrite Alliance cruiser.

961
00:53:56,014 --> 00:53:58,953
They are always eager to hire
experienced officers.

962
00:53:58,988 --> 00:54:00,719
The Nyberrite Alliance?

963
00:54:00,759 --> 00:54:02,957
That's a long way.

964
00:54:02,998 --> 00:54:04,592
And what about your son?

965
00:54:06,271 --> 00:54:07,706
Alexander is much happier

966
00:54:07,742 --> 00:54:09,838
living with his grandparents
on Earth

967
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,783
than he ever was
staying with me.

968
00:54:11,818 --> 00:54:14,382
And one thing is certain...

969
00:54:14,425 --> 00:54:16,828
the sooner I leave here,
the better.

970
00:54:16,864 --> 00:54:18,858
My continued presence
on Deep Space 9

971
00:54:18,902 --> 00:54:21,169
would only be a liability
to Captain Sisko

972
00:54:21,207 --> 00:54:23,075
in his dealings
with the Klingons.

973
00:54:23,112 --> 00:54:24,672
Do you hear that, Chief?

974
00:54:24,716 --> 00:54:28,213
72 decibels.
Music to my ears.

975
00:54:28,258 --> 00:54:30,286
I think I liked it better
when it was quiet.

976
00:54:30,329 --> 00:54:32,800
You want quiet,
go to the Replimat.

977
00:54:32,836 --> 00:54:35,570
This is Quark's
the way Quark's should be

978
00:54:35,608 --> 00:54:37,476
the way it was meant to be.

979
00:54:37,513 --> 00:54:40,817
Am I glad we finally got rid
of all those Klingons.

980
00:54:41,924 --> 00:54:44,556
Uh... present company
excepted, of course.

981
00:54:50,846 --> 00:54:53,044
I got to hand it to you, Quark.

982
00:54:53,084 --> 00:54:56,422
You really know how to make
your customers feel welcome.

983
00:54:58,530 --> 00:54:59,520
What do I care?

984
00:54:59,566 --> 00:55:01,901
All he ever drinks
is prune juice.

985
00:55:01,938 --> 00:55:03,567
I'm sorry, Mr. Worf

986
00:55:03,676 --> 00:55:06,530
but I can't accept
your resignation at this time.

987
00:55:07,967 --> 00:55:09,767
I do not understand.

988
00:55:09,804 --> 00:55:11,866
What further use
could I be here?

989
00:55:11,909 --> 00:55:13,606
I'm not sure yet.

990
00:55:13,647 --> 00:55:15,550
But as long
as the fighting continues

991
00:55:15,584 --> 00:55:17,680
between the Klingons
and the Cardassians

992
00:55:17,723 --> 00:55:19,523
I need you here on the station.

993
00:55:21,766 --> 00:55:24,135
If you think that is wise.

994
00:55:25,241 --> 00:55:28,511
I don't know
if it's wise or not.

995
00:55:28,548 --> 00:55:30,883
But I do know
that you're a good officer

996
00:55:30,921 --> 00:55:33,985
and right now, I need
every good officer I can get.

997
00:55:35,532 --> 00:55:38,528
Captain, we just got word
from Bajoran Intelligence.

998
00:55:38,572 --> 00:55:41,374
The Klingons have broken through
the Cardassian fleet.

999
00:55:41,413 --> 00:55:44,443
How long before they reach
Cardassia Prime?

1000
00:55:44,487 --> 00:55:46,013
52 hours.

1001
00:55:46,058 --> 00:55:48,895
If the Klingon Empire has
reverted to the old practices

1002
00:55:48,931 --> 00:55:50,765
they will occupy
the Cardassian homeworld

1003
00:55:50,803 --> 00:55:52,238
execute all government officials

1004
00:55:52,273 --> 00:55:54,642
and install an Imperial Overseer

1005
00:55:54,678 --> 00:55:57,149
to put down
any further resistance.

1006
00:55:57,184 --> 00:56:00,784
I think it's about time we had
a talk with the Cardassians.

1007
00:56:00,827 --> 00:56:02,991
Captain, I'm a little busy
at the moment

1008
00:56:03,065 --> 00:56:05,902
so whatever you have to say,
please make it brief.

1009
00:56:05,939 --> 00:56:07,238
Dukat?

1010
00:56:07,275 --> 00:56:10,339
I was trying to reach someone
in the civilian government.

1011
00:56:10,382 --> 00:56:12,011
And you have succeeded.

1012
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:15,025
You are speaking to the new
Chief Military Advisor

1013
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:16,359
to the Detapa Council.

1014
00:56:16,396 --> 00:56:19,802
Does this mean you've turned
your back on Central Command?

1015
00:56:19,838 --> 00:56:23,438
It means that as a loyal officer
of the Cardassian military

1016
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,006
I am pledged to serve

1017
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:27,750
the legitimate ruling body
of the Empire

1018
00:56:27,791 --> 00:56:29,317
whoever that may be.

1019
00:56:29,361 --> 00:56:32,631
In other words, you saw
which way the wind was blowing

1020
00:56:32,669 --> 00:56:34,298
and switched sides.

1021
00:56:34,339 --> 00:56:36,640
It seemed like a good idea
at the time.

1022
00:56:36,679 --> 00:56:39,846
Dukat, you have got to get
those council members to safety

1023
00:56:39,886 --> 00:56:42,415
before the Klingons
reach Cardassia Prime.

1024
00:56:42,459 --> 00:56:45,023
I am open to suggestions,
Captain.

1025
00:56:45,065 --> 00:56:48,562
If you can get a ship
and meet me at these coordinates

1026
00:56:48,607 --> 00:56:52,104
I'll do what I can to escort you
out of the war zone.

1027
00:56:52,182 --> 00:56:55,816
That is a very generous offer.

1028
00:56:55,859 --> 00:56:58,798
I must say I am touched.

1029
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:01,361
By saving the members
of the Detapa Council

1030
00:57:01,404 --> 00:57:03,307
you will be saving some very...

1031
00:57:03,343 --> 00:57:04,642
Forget the speech, Dukat.

1032
00:57:04,679 --> 00:57:06,376
Just meet me
at the rendezvous point.

1033
00:57:06,416 --> 00:57:08,444
And if the Klingons
try to stop us?

1034
00:57:08,488 --> 00:57:10,288
Then I'll be there
to reason with them.

1035
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:12,958
I doubt the Klingons
will fire on a Federation ship.

1036
00:57:12,999 --> 00:57:15,597
I'm not sure I share
your optimism.

1037
00:57:15,639 --> 00:57:19,341
But, then, I don't have
much choice, do I?

1038
00:57:19,381 --> 00:57:21,078
We'll meet you there.

1039
00:57:23,825 --> 00:57:26,228
Sir...

1040
00:57:26,264 --> 00:57:27,927
if the Klingons are right...

1041
00:57:27,968 --> 00:57:29,096
if the Cardassian government

1042
00:57:29,138 --> 00:57:30,630
has been taken over
by the Founders...

1043
00:57:30,675 --> 00:57:32,669
Then we'll be helping
them to escape.

1044
00:57:32,713 --> 00:57:34,342
That's the chance
we'll have to take.

1045
00:57:37,892 --> 00:57:40,558
I know you want to be
out of that uniform

1046
00:57:40,598 --> 00:57:43,537
but right now,
I need you with me.

1047
00:57:45,042 --> 00:57:46,409
I understand.

1048
00:57:50,622 --> 00:57:52,387
Make sure the Chief
double-checks

1049
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:53,555
all our new systems.

1050
00:57:53,596 --> 00:57:54,586
We may need them.

1051
00:57:54,632 --> 00:57:56,033
I'll tell him,
but knowing the Chief

1052
00:57:56,069 --> 00:57:57,299
he's probably doing it already.

1053
00:57:57,338 --> 00:57:58,898
Keep the station
on Yellow Alert.

1054
00:57:58,943 --> 00:58:02,885
And just to be on the safe side,
I'd recommend that you send

1055
00:58:02,918 --> 00:58:05,389
some of the civilian population
down to Bajor.

1056
00:58:05,425 --> 00:58:07,419
I was planning to.

1057
00:58:07,463 --> 00:58:09,730
I wish I was going with you.

1058
00:58:09,769 --> 00:58:10,737
So do I.

1059
00:58:10,771 --> 00:58:13,140
But I need you here.

1060
00:58:16,819 --> 00:58:17,809
Ben!

1061
00:58:19,692 --> 00:58:23,189
I'm, uh... glad I caught you
before you left.

1062
00:58:23,234 --> 00:58:24,202
So am I.

1063
00:58:24,303 --> 00:58:25,293
When'd you get back?

1064
00:58:25,339 --> 00:58:27,139
Uh, less than an hour ago.

1065
00:58:27,177 --> 00:58:31,745
Jake told me you were
about to go off on...

1066
00:58:31,788 --> 00:58:33,223
some kind of mission.

1067
00:58:33,292 --> 00:58:35,786
The <i>Defiant</i> leaves
in a few minutes.

1068
00:58:35,831 --> 00:58:38,497
And you can't tell me
about it.

1069
00:58:38,537 --> 00:58:41,271
I'll be back
in four or five days.

1070
00:58:42,981 --> 00:58:45,384
I'm leaving tomorrow.

1071
00:58:45,421 --> 00:58:47,358
Phew!

1072
00:58:47,391 --> 00:58:50,489
I guess our timing
hasn't been too good.

1073
00:58:50,533 --> 00:58:51,729
No.

1074
00:58:51,769 --> 00:58:53,740
No, it's been terrible.

1075
00:58:53,773 --> 00:58:57,441
I'm not even sure
when I'll be back.

1076
00:58:59,822 --> 00:59:01,725
Make it soon.

1077
00:59:24,314 --> 00:59:26,946
Don't get killed.

1078
00:59:26,987 --> 00:59:29,117
I'll do my best.

1079
00:59:48,438 --> 00:59:50,203
Activate the cloaking device.

1080
00:59:50,242 --> 00:59:53,010
Cloaking device is functioning
within normal parameters.

1081
00:59:54,653 --> 00:59:56,624
Set a course
for the rendezvous point.

1082
00:59:56,658 --> 00:59:57,717
Maximum warp.

1083
00:59:57,761 --> 00:59:59,664
Course laid in.

1084
00:59:59,699 --> 01:00:01,134
Engage.

1085
01:00:01,169 --> 01:00:04,336
Mr. Worf, keep an eye out
for Klingon ships

1086
01:00:04,376 --> 01:00:05,538
cloaked or otherwise.

1087
01:00:05,579 --> 01:00:07,413
Aye, sir.

1088
01:00:09,923 --> 01:00:12,657
Is something wrong, Mr. Worf?

1089
01:00:12,697 --> 01:00:15,363
No, sir.

1090
01:00:15,402 --> 01:00:17,396
Yes, sir.

1091
01:00:17,441 --> 01:00:19,138
It is just...

1092
01:00:19,179 --> 01:00:21,150
I have never been
on a Federation starship

1093
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:22,414
that had a cloaking device.

1094
01:00:22,519 --> 01:00:25,390
It is... a little strange.

1095
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:28,256
You'll get used to it.

1096
01:00:32,276 --> 01:00:34,976
Sir, I hate to bring this up

1097
01:00:35,016 --> 01:00:36,315
but our agreement
with the Romulans

1098
01:00:36,353 --> 01:00:38,118
expressly prohibits use
of the cloaking device

1099
01:00:38,157 --> 01:00:39,251
in the Alpha Quadrant.

1100
01:00:39,293 --> 01:00:40,853
You're right, it does.

1101
01:00:40,897 --> 01:00:43,232
But there are hundreds
of Klingon ships

1102
01:00:43,269 --> 01:00:44,465
between us and Dukat

1103
01:00:44,539 --> 01:00:47,740
and I intend to make
that rendezvous in one piece.

1104
01:00:47,781 --> 01:00:50,413
Well, I won't tell the Romulans
if you don't.

1105
01:00:59,074 --> 01:01:01,102
I never thought I'd say this

1106
01:01:01,145 --> 01:01:06,454
but right now...
I'm glad the Dominion's around.

1107
01:01:06,525 --> 01:01:09,191
Otherwise, we never would have
started these upgrades

1108
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:12,137
let alone have them
almost finished by now.

1109
01:01:12,172 --> 01:01:14,143
Well, there's something to be
said for incentive.

1110
01:01:14,177 --> 01:01:15,339
Uh-huh.

1111
01:01:15,379 --> 01:01:17,282
I just hope everything
works okay.

1112
01:01:17,318 --> 01:01:19,482
You're saying you're not sure?

1113
01:01:19,523 --> 01:01:22,759
The way I see it,
there are two possibilities.

1114
01:01:22,798 --> 01:01:24,894
Either everything
will be fine, or...

1115
01:01:24,936 --> 01:01:25,961
Or?

1116
01:01:26,005 --> 01:01:28,978
Or we'll end up blowing
the station to pieces.

1117
01:01:29,012 --> 01:01:30,949
Oh.

1118
01:01:30,984 --> 01:01:33,114
Well, let's hope
we don't have to find out.

1119
01:01:36,564 --> 01:01:37,692
Captain...

1120
01:01:37,734 --> 01:01:39,898
I am detecting some debris.

1121
01:01:39,939 --> 01:01:43,846
Bearing 025 mark 319.

1122
01:01:43,881 --> 01:01:46,352
Commander, drop us
to one-quarter impulse.

1123
01:01:46,388 --> 01:01:48,153
Aye, Captain.

1124
01:01:48,191 --> 01:01:49,854
It appears to be the wreckage

1125
01:01:49,896 --> 01:01:51,833
of a number
of Cardassian vessels.

1126
01:01:51,867 --> 01:01:53,268
On screen.

1127
01:01:56,445 --> 01:01:58,939
Are there any signs
of survivors?

1128
01:01:58,984 --> 01:02:01,182
I suppose it's possible.

1129
01:02:01,222 --> 01:02:03,386
But there's no way to know
without de-cloaking

1130
01:02:03,429 --> 01:02:05,366
and using our primary
sensor array.

1131
01:02:05,399 --> 01:02:08,031
Sir, I strongly recommend
against that.

1132
01:02:08,073 --> 01:02:10,544
It is likely there are
cloaked Klingon warships

1133
01:02:10,579 --> 01:02:12,208
in the vicinity lying in wait.

1134
01:02:12,249 --> 01:02:14,813
Well, that doesn't sound
very honorable to me.

1135
01:02:14,855 --> 01:02:18,387
In war, there is nothing
more honorable than victory.

1136
01:02:21,705 --> 01:02:24,941
Commander, keep us
at one-quarter impulse...

1137
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:27,417
until we've cleared
the wreckage.

1138
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:29,217
Then take us to warp.

1139
01:02:29,257 --> 01:02:32,355
But, sir...
if there are survivors...

1140
01:02:32,398 --> 01:02:33,992
I'm sorry, Doctor,
we can't risk it.

1141
01:02:34,035 --> 01:02:35,129
We have to reach Dukat.

1142
01:02:37,978 --> 01:02:40,142
And double-check the
secondary power grid.

1143
01:02:40,183 --> 01:02:42,518
It's still not performing
as well as it should.

1144
01:02:42,555 --> 01:02:44,379
Yes, sir.

1145
01:02:47,051 --> 01:02:48,452
What's our status?

1146
01:02:48,489 --> 01:02:50,517
We're approaching
the rendezvous point.

1147
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:54,365
Captain, I am detecting
weapons fire ahead.

1148
01:02:54,403 --> 01:02:56,874
It appears to be three
Klingon birds-of-prey

1149
01:02:56,908 --> 01:02:58,605
attacking a Cardassian vessel.

1150
01:02:58,646 --> 01:03:00,446
The vessel is badly damaged.

1151
01:03:00,484 --> 01:03:02,249
Captain, I'm picking up
a distress signal

1152
01:03:02,288 --> 01:03:03,313
from Dukat, audio only.

1153
01:03:03,357 --> 01:03:04,519
Put it through.

1154
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:07,431
This is Gul Dukat
of the Cruiser <i>Prakesh.</i>

1155
01:03:07,467 --> 01:03:08,697
We're under heavy fire.

1156
01:03:08,737 --> 01:03:10,434
Our shields are failing.

1157
01:03:10,474 --> 01:03:12,968
I don't know how much longer
we can hold out.

1158
01:03:13,014 --> 01:03:15,178
Send reinforcements immediately.

1159
01:03:15,219 --> 01:03:16,916
I repeat, this is...

1160
01:03:16,956 --> 01:03:18,323
We're in visual range.

1161
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:19,829
On screen.

1162
01:03:19,863 --> 01:03:21,857
Maximum magnification.

1163
01:03:24,742 --> 01:03:27,647
Two decades of peace
with the Klingons

1164
01:03:27,682 --> 01:03:29,242
and it all comes down to this.

1165
01:03:29,353 --> 01:03:32,121
Orders, Captain.

1166
01:03:37,339 --> 01:03:38,672
Benjamin...

1167
01:03:38,709 --> 01:03:41,705
Dukat's ship isn't going
to last much longer.

1168
01:03:45,491 --> 01:03:47,519
Arm quantum torpedoes...

1169
01:03:47,563 --> 01:03:51,767
drop the cloak,
and raise shields.

1170
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:53,436
We're going in.

1171
01:04:06,141 --> 01:04:07,440
Red Alert.

1172
01:04:07,478 --> 01:04:08,446
Doctor.

1173
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:11,214
Commander Worf, transmit
a priority one signal

1174
01:04:11,253 --> 01:04:12,449
to the Klingon ship.

1175
01:04:12,490 --> 01:04:14,050
Tell them to break off
their attack

1176
01:04:14,093 --> 01:04:15,790
and stand down immediately.

1177
01:04:17,301 --> 01:04:18,634
Message sent.

1178
01:04:18,672 --> 01:04:20,141
Captain, I find it
highly unlikely

1179
01:04:20,175 --> 01:04:21,735
that the Klingons
will heed your...

1180
01:04:23,149 --> 01:04:25,120
We've been fired upon
by the lead bird-of-prey.

1181
01:04:25,154 --> 01:04:26,122
Shields are holding.

1182
01:04:26,156 --> 01:04:28,559
I see your point, Mr. Worf.

1183
01:04:28,594 --> 01:04:32,035
Let's show them
what they're up against.

1184
01:04:32,070 --> 01:04:34,303
Attack pattern omega.
Target their engines.

1185
01:04:43,063 --> 01:04:44,966
Incoming message
from the Cardassian ship.

1186
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,401
Put it through.

1187
01:04:51,316 --> 01:04:53,219
I must compliment you, Captain.

1188
01:04:53,254 --> 01:04:56,022
You're nearly Cardassian
in your punctuality.

1189
01:04:56,061 --> 01:04:57,861
Fire phasers!

1190
01:04:57,898 --> 01:04:59,367
Dukat, power up your engines

1191
01:04:59,402 --> 01:05:01,373
and prepare to follow us
back to DS9.

1192
01:05:01,406 --> 01:05:03,970
An excellent suggestion, Captain

1193
01:05:04,013 --> 01:05:06,611
assuming
we had any engines left.

1194
01:05:06,653 --> 01:05:07,849
What's your status?

1195
01:05:10,027 --> 01:05:12,362
Our engines are gone,
our shields are down

1196
01:05:12,433 --> 01:05:14,370
and we have no weapons
to speak of.

1197
01:05:14,438 --> 01:05:15,497
Prepare to evacuate.

1198
01:05:15,541 --> 01:05:17,512
We'll start to beam you over
as soon as possible.

1199
01:05:17,546 --> 01:05:20,178
You'd have to drop your shields
to use your transporters.

1200
01:05:20,219 --> 01:05:21,916
Let me worry about that.
Sisko out.

1201
01:05:29,073 --> 01:05:30,633
Sir, restricting our fire

1202
01:05:30,677 --> 01:05:33,046
to their engines
has not proven effective.

1203
01:05:33,083 --> 01:05:35,077
Very well.
Target at your discretion.

1204
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:36,384
Aye, aye, sir.

1205
01:05:51,661 --> 01:05:52,686
Dukat's ship is under fire.

1206
01:05:52,730 --> 01:05:54,427
I don't know how much longer
they can hold out.

1207
01:05:54,468 --> 01:05:56,871
Another Klingon ship
has just de-cloaked.

1208
01:05:56,907 --> 01:05:58,433
It is a Vor'cha-class
attack cruiser.

1209
01:05:58,477 --> 01:06:00,448
Sisko to Transporter Bay.

1210
01:06:00,482 --> 01:06:03,046
Stand by to beam aboard
survivors.

1211
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:12,644
Sisko to Bashir.

1212
01:06:12,678 --> 01:06:14,113
Prepare to receive casualties.

1213
01:06:14,148 --> 01:06:16,346
And, Doctor, have Security
standing by.

1214
01:06:16,386 --> 01:06:19,416
I want our guests
to undergo blood screenings.

1215
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:20,428
Understood.

1216
01:06:20,463 --> 01:06:21,693
Blood screenings?

1217
01:06:21,733 --> 01:06:24,399
Just in case Martok was right.

1218
01:06:25,709 --> 01:06:27,907
Benjamin, it's going to take
at least two minutes

1219
01:06:27,947 --> 01:06:29,075
to evacuate Dukat's ship.

1220
01:06:29,117 --> 01:06:31,315
Even with the <i>Defiant's</i>
new armor, I don't think

1221
01:06:31,356 --> 01:06:33,384
we can last that long
with our shields down.

1222
01:06:33,427 --> 01:06:34,395
Sir.

1223
01:06:34,429 --> 01:06:35,625
I have a suggestion.

1224
01:06:45,188 --> 01:06:46,521
You were right, Mr. Worf.

1225
01:06:46,592 --> 01:06:48,186
The modulated tractor
beam's deflecting

1226
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:50,167
some of the Klingon's
disrupter fire.

1227
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:52,398
Disrupter's effectiveness
at 50 percent.

1228
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,103
Well done, Mr. Worf.

1229
01:06:54,144 --> 01:06:55,340
Lower shields.

1230
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:56,974
Sisko to Transporter Bay.

1231
01:06:57,017 --> 01:06:58,954
Begin emergency transports.

1232
01:06:58,989 --> 01:07:00,549
Transports underway.

1233
01:07:03,199 --> 01:07:04,828
The ablative armor is holding.

1234
01:07:04,869 --> 01:07:06,429
Klingon ships are closing.

1235
01:07:06,473 --> 01:07:09,446
Armor on the port side
is losing integrity.

1236
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:11,883
Transporter Bay,
what's our status?

1237
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:14,722
Captain, this is Dukat.

1238
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:17,289
Almost half the council members
are still aboard my ship.

1239
01:07:17,332 --> 01:07:20,203
We need at least another minute.

1240
01:07:20,239 --> 01:07:21,674
Looks like we're going
to find out

1241
01:07:21,709 --> 01:07:23,771
just how much of a pounding
this ship can take.

1242
01:07:23,814 --> 01:07:26,981
The Klingons have closed
to point-blank range.

1243
01:07:29,729 --> 01:07:30,959
Ablative armor has failed.

1244
01:07:30,998 --> 01:07:33,367
We've got plasma leaks
on decks 2, 3 and 5.

1245
01:07:33,404 --> 01:07:36,468
And we've lost
our aft torpedo launchers.

1246
01:07:36,512 --> 01:07:37,480
Dukat to Sisko.

1247
01:07:37,515 --> 01:07:38,814
Go ahead.

1248
01:07:38,850 --> 01:07:40,684
The council members are aboard.

1249
01:07:40,722 --> 01:07:42,522
Raise shields.
Activate the cloak.

1250
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:43,756
Shields up.

1251
01:07:43,795 --> 01:07:47,031
I'm not getting any response
from the cloaking device.

1252
01:07:47,070 --> 01:07:48,369
It's not working.

1253
01:07:48,407 --> 01:07:49,933
Well, that should make
the trip home

1254
01:07:49,977 --> 01:07:51,139
a little more interesting.

1255
01:07:51,181 --> 01:07:53,813
Set a course for DS9,
maximum warp.

1256
01:08:12,431 --> 01:08:14,595
Thank you, Doctor,
but if you don't mind

1257
01:08:14,636 --> 01:08:16,504
I would like to go
to the Bridge now.

1258
01:08:16,541 --> 01:08:18,603
This will only take a minute.
Your arm, please.

1259
01:08:18,713 --> 01:08:20,616
What is the meaning
of this?

1260
01:08:20,651 --> 01:08:22,314
Just a simple blood screening.

1261
01:08:22,355 --> 01:08:25,419
I assure you, Doctor,
I am not a changeling.

1262
01:08:25,463 --> 01:08:27,160
Then you have nothing
to worry about.

1263
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:29,330
I find this whole
procedure offensive.

1264
01:08:29,372 --> 01:08:30,602
And I find you offensive.

1265
01:08:30,642 --> 01:08:31,610
Now hold up your arm

1266
01:08:31,644 --> 01:08:33,706
or I'll have a Security
Officer do it for you.

1267
01:08:47,048 --> 01:08:49,383
Captain, would
you kindly inform

1268
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:50,821
this security guard

1269
01:08:50,856 --> 01:08:54,353
that he does not have
to monitor my every move.

1270
01:08:54,398 --> 01:08:56,699
It makes me feel unwelcome.

1271
01:08:56,737 --> 01:08:58,935
Looks like I won, Benjamin.

1272
01:08:58,975 --> 01:09:00,274
You owe me dinner.

1273
01:09:00,312 --> 01:09:03,046
And what is that
supposed to mean?

1274
01:09:03,086 --> 01:09:06,116
Captain Sisko bet me that you
would thank him for the rescue

1275
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:07,629
before you started
complaining.

1276
01:09:07,664 --> 01:09:08,997
I lost.

1277
01:09:10,604 --> 01:09:14,944
Captain, are you aware
there's a Klingon

1278
01:09:14,981 --> 01:09:16,245
on your Bridge?

1279
01:09:16,284 --> 01:09:19,052
He's not the Klingon you
should be worried about.

1280
01:09:19,091 --> 01:09:22,827
Switch to aft view,
maximum magnification.

1281
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:30,578
Hmm.

1282
01:09:30,619 --> 01:09:34,219
I'd suggest you cloak
immediately.

1283
01:09:34,261 --> 01:09:36,755
We lost our cloaking device
rescuing you.

1284
01:09:51,134 --> 01:09:54,107
Might I trouble you
for a glass of <i>kanar?</i>

1285
01:09:57,216 --> 01:09:58,378
Help yourself.

1286
01:09:58,419 --> 01:09:59,786
It's on the house.

1287
01:09:59,889 --> 01:10:02,691
Well, how uncharacteristically
generous of you.

1288
01:10:02,729 --> 01:10:04,791
I'm in an uncharacteristic mood.

1289
01:10:04,834 --> 01:10:06,497
Besides, I've got
80 cases of this stuff

1290
01:10:06,538 --> 01:10:07,768
sitting in my stockroom.

1291
01:10:07,808 --> 01:10:10,474
And the way things are going,
I'll never unload another bottle

1292
01:10:10,514 --> 01:10:11,915
unless it's to you.

1293
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:14,514
How thoughtless of me
not to consider the effects

1294
01:10:14,557 --> 01:10:18,191
the destruction of my homeworld
would have on your business.

1295
01:10:18,232 --> 01:10:21,399
These must be
trying times for you.

1296
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:22,082
Be brave.

1297
01:10:22,215 --> 01:10:24,550
I should have listened
to my cousin Gaila.

1298
01:10:24,587 --> 01:10:28,426
He said to me, "Quark, I got
one word for you... weapons."

1299
01:10:28,464 --> 01:10:29,933
No one ever went broke

1300
01:10:29,967 --> 01:10:31,231
selling weapons.

1301
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:33,298
But did I take his advice?

1302
01:10:33,341 --> 01:10:35,642
No.

1303
01:10:35,681 --> 01:10:38,084
And why not?

1304
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:40,888
Because I'm a people person.

1305
01:10:40,927 --> 01:10:43,991
I like interacting
with my customers

1306
01:10:44,034 --> 01:10:46,028
like you and I are doing
right now.

1307
01:10:46,072 --> 01:10:47,632
Talking to each other

1308
01:10:47,676 --> 01:10:49,270
getting to know one another.

1309
01:10:49,314 --> 01:10:52,310
I can see the attraction
for you.

1310
01:10:52,354 --> 01:10:54,017
But when you're dealing
in weapons

1311
01:10:54,058 --> 01:10:56,461
buyers aren't interested
in casual conversation.

1312
01:10:56,497 --> 01:10:58,331
They just want
their merchandise

1313
01:10:58,368 --> 01:10:59,803
no questions asked.

1314
01:10:59,838 --> 01:11:01,000
So impersonal.

1315
01:11:01,041 --> 01:11:03,274
Your charms would be wasted.

1316
01:11:03,313 --> 01:11:04,942
Exactly.

1317
01:11:06,755 --> 01:11:10,560
So now, Gaila owns his own moon

1318
01:11:10,597 --> 01:11:14,163
and I'm staring into the abyss.

1319
01:11:14,207 --> 01:11:16,474
And the worst part of it is

1320
01:11:16,512 --> 01:11:20,648
my only hope for salvation
is the Federation.

1321
01:11:20,689 --> 01:11:23,787
I know precisely how you feel.

1322
01:11:29,543 --> 01:11:32,607
I want you to try
something for me.

1323
01:11:32,650 --> 01:11:34,142
Take sip of this.

1324
01:11:34,187 --> 01:11:35,486
What is it?

1325
01:11:35,524 --> 01:11:37,586
A human drink.

1326
01:11:37,629 --> 01:11:39,064
It's called root beer.

1327
01:11:39,099 --> 01:11:40,295
I don't know.

1328
01:11:40,336 --> 01:11:41,395
Come on.

1329
01:11:41,472 --> 01:11:44,206
Aren't you just
a little bit curious?

1330
01:11:49,424 --> 01:11:50,950
What do you think?

1331
01:11:50,994 --> 01:11:52,725
It's vile.

1332
01:11:52,765 --> 01:11:54,234
I know.

1333
01:11:54,269 --> 01:11:56,798
It's so bubbly and cloying

1334
01:11:56,842 --> 01:11:58,676
and happy.

1335
01:11:58,713 --> 01:12:01,949
Just like the Federation.

1336
01:12:01,987 --> 01:12:04,117
But you know
what's really frightening?

1337
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:08,397
If you drink enough of it,
you begin to like it.

1338
01:12:08,503 --> 01:12:10,633
It's insidious.

1339
01:12:10,674 --> 01:12:14,376
Just like the Federation.

1340
01:12:15,386 --> 01:12:18,622
Do you think
they'll be able to save us?

1341
01:12:20,298 --> 01:12:22,292
I hope so.

1342
01:12:23,673 --> 01:12:25,199
- Any luck?
- Not yet.

1343
01:12:26,245 --> 01:12:27,213
Hold on.

1344
01:12:27,248 --> 01:12:29,719
I'm picking up something
on long-range scanners.

1345
01:12:30,722 --> 01:12:31,712
It's the <i>Defiant.</i>

1346
01:12:31,759 --> 01:12:32,727
They made it.

1347
01:12:32,761 --> 01:12:35,232
Yeah, but they've got
two Klingon ships

1348
01:12:35,267 --> 01:12:36,600
on their tail.

1349
01:12:36,637 --> 01:12:39,040
The Captain's hailing us.

1350
01:12:39,076 --> 01:12:41,411
On screen.

1351
01:12:41,448 --> 01:12:42,883
Chief, our ETA
is in five minutes.

1352
01:12:42,919 --> 01:12:44,149
Are the new systems on line?

1353
01:12:44,188 --> 01:12:45,247
Yes, sir.

1354
01:12:45,291 --> 01:12:46,988
I think
we're going to need them.

1355
01:12:47,028 --> 01:12:48,657
I wish we could have
tested them first.

1356
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:50,329
No time like the present.

1357
01:12:50,370 --> 01:12:51,737
Raise shields.

1358
01:12:51,773 --> 01:12:53,504
Red Alert.

1359
01:12:55,682 --> 01:12:56,878
Now what?!

1360
01:12:56,919 --> 01:12:58,513
Well, I can't be sure, of course

1361
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:00,618
but my guess would be Klingons.

1362
01:13:00,661 --> 01:13:02,564
The Klingons?

1363
01:13:02,599 --> 01:13:06,632
First, it was the Cardassians,
then it was the Dominion

1364
01:13:06,676 --> 01:13:08,772
now it's the Klingons!

1365
01:13:08,814 --> 01:13:11,149
How's a Ferengi supposed
to make an honest living

1366
01:13:11,186 --> 01:13:12,245
in a place like this?

1367
01:13:22,247 --> 01:13:23,215
Drop out of warp.

1368
01:13:23,249 --> 01:13:24,684
Reverse thrusters at maximum.

1369
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:25,778
Prepare for docking.

1370
01:13:25,822 --> 01:13:26,790
Aye, sir.

1371
01:13:26,824 --> 01:13:28,521
Well, it looks like the Klingons

1372
01:13:28,628 --> 01:13:30,758
chased us all this way
for nothing.

1373
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,737
That remains to be seen.

1374
01:13:32,771 --> 01:13:35,539
Klingons do not give up easily.

1375
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:37,845
Two ships against a station?

1376
01:13:37,883 --> 01:13:39,854
I don't think they'd risk it.

1377
01:13:39,888 --> 01:13:42,086
It may not be much of a risk.

1378
01:13:42,127 --> 01:13:43,391
Why do you say that?

1379
01:13:43,430 --> 01:13:44,956
They've got friends.

1380
01:13:56,629 --> 01:13:58,121
Status report, Major.

1381
01:13:58,166 --> 01:14:00,160
I'm detecting
several dozen Klingon ships

1382
01:14:00,204 --> 01:14:01,366
including the <i>Negh'Var.</i>

1383
01:14:01,407 --> 01:14:02,706
They're in an attack formation.

1384
01:14:02,743 --> 01:14:05,044
While you were gone,
we spoke to Starfleet Command.

1385
01:14:05,082 --> 01:14:07,451
They sent a relief force
under Admiral Hastur.

1386
01:14:07,488 --> 01:14:08,752
When will they get here?

1387
01:14:08,792 --> 01:14:09,988
Not soon enough.

1388
01:14:10,027 --> 01:14:12,556
The Klingon ships
have raised their shields

1389
01:14:12,634 --> 01:14:14,001
and charged their weapons.

1390
01:14:14,037 --> 01:14:16,440
What are your orders, Captain?

1391
01:14:20,686 --> 01:14:22,919
Battle stations.

1392
01:14:27,803 --> 01:14:30,172
The thing to remember is
that the Klingons prefer to use

1393
01:14:30,210 --> 01:14:32,340
their knives and <i>bat'leths</i>
in close combat.

1394
01:14:32,381 --> 01:14:35,354
So if we get boarded, you can
expect severe lacerations

1395
01:14:35,388 --> 01:14:38,555
broken bones,
and blunt force traumas.

1396
01:14:38,596 --> 01:14:42,264
All I can say is keep calm,
remember your training...

1397
01:14:42,304 --> 01:14:44,332
and do the best that you can.

1398
01:14:44,376 --> 01:14:45,572
Report to your posts.

1399
01:14:49,523 --> 01:14:51,254
Doctor.

1400
01:14:51,293 --> 01:14:53,058
Constable, what can I
do for you?

1401
01:14:53,098 --> 01:14:55,535
I just wanted you to know
I'll be assigning

1402
01:14:55,570 --> 01:14:58,634
a security unit to the Infirmary
for your protection.

1403
01:14:58,677 --> 01:15:00,511
Well, thank you,
but I'd rather you didn't.

1404
01:15:00,549 --> 01:15:02,314
I'm going to have
wounded people in here.

1405
01:15:02,352 --> 01:15:03,844
The last thing I need
is a team of deputies

1406
01:15:03,890 --> 01:15:05,758
having a fire fight
in my doorway.

1407
01:15:05,794 --> 01:15:07,127
I understand.

1408
01:15:08,836 --> 01:15:10,567
Just do me a favor.

1409
01:15:10,606 --> 01:15:13,773
Don't count on that blue uniform
to protect you.

1410
01:15:13,814 --> 01:15:15,785
In the heat of battle

1411
01:15:15,818 --> 01:15:18,586
Klingons aren't very choosy
about their targets.

1412
01:15:18,625 --> 01:15:19,650
Doctor or no doctor

1413
01:15:19,761 --> 01:15:22,859
you might end up
having to defend yourself.

1414
01:15:22,902 --> 01:15:24,873
Well, hopefully,
it won't come to that.

1415
01:15:24,907 --> 01:15:28,005
But if it does,
I promise you I'll be ready.

1416
01:15:28,047 --> 01:15:29,448
That's all I ask.

1417
01:15:29,484 --> 01:15:31,455
And while we're
on the subject, Constable

1418
01:15:31,489 --> 01:15:33,357
I'm sure there's
more than one Klingon

1419
01:15:33,394 --> 01:15:35,159
who thinks that slaying
a changeling

1420
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:36,827
would be worthy
of a song or two.

1421
01:15:36,869 --> 01:15:38,634
Doctor, if a Klingon
were to kill me

1422
01:15:38,673 --> 01:15:41,977
I'd expect nothing less than
an entire opera on the subject.

1423
01:15:42,015 --> 01:15:43,712
Maybe.

1424
01:15:43,785 --> 01:15:45,881
I just don't want
to have to listen to it.

1425
01:15:45,924 --> 01:15:47,188
Watch your back.

1426
01:15:57,117 --> 01:15:58,484
Come on, Quark, move it along.

1427
01:15:58,521 --> 01:16:00,617
You should be
in the emergency shelter by now.

1428
01:16:00,659 --> 01:16:02,562
I'm not going
to any emergency shelter.

1429
01:16:02,597 --> 01:16:04,693
This is my bar
and I'm going to defend it.

1430
01:16:04,736 --> 01:16:07,003
Really? And how do
you plan to do that?

1431
01:16:07,041 --> 01:16:08,442
With this.

1432
01:16:08,478 --> 01:16:10,449
You're going to hit
them with a box?

1433
01:16:10,483 --> 01:16:12,043
No. This is my disrupter pistol.

1434
01:16:12,087 --> 01:16:13,454
The one I used to carry
in the old days

1435
01:16:13,490 --> 01:16:15,119
when I was serving
on that Ferengi freighter.

1436
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:16,925
I thought you were
the ship's cook.

1437
01:16:16,965 --> 01:16:18,229
That's right.

1438
01:16:18,268 --> 01:16:20,432
And every member of that crew
thought he was a food critic.

1439
01:16:20,474 --> 01:16:23,106
If the Klingons try
to get through these doors

1440
01:16:23,146 --> 01:16:25,049
I'll be ready for them.

1441
01:16:25,084 --> 01:16:27,555
"Dear Quark

1442
01:16:27,591 --> 01:16:30,758
"I used parts of your disrupter
to fix the replicators.

1443
01:16:30,798 --> 01:16:32,427
Will return them soon. Rom."

1444
01:16:32,468 --> 01:16:34,598
I will kill him.

1445
01:16:34,641 --> 01:16:36,133
With what?

1446
01:17:00,168 --> 01:17:03,141
That's close enough, Garak.

1447
01:17:03,175 --> 01:17:06,376
I wanted to make sure that
the council members were safe.

1448
01:17:06,417 --> 01:17:09,049
Hoping, no doubt,
that your concern

1449
01:17:09,090 --> 01:17:12,291
would curry
some political favor?

1450
01:17:12,331 --> 01:17:13,630
Oh, and I take it

1451
01:17:13,667 --> 01:17:18,007
your concern is motivated
strictly by patriotism.

1452
01:17:18,044 --> 01:17:21,815
Oh, the council members
are well aware of my patriotism.

1453
01:17:21,921 --> 01:17:26,227
And the sacrifices I was willing
to make in order to save them.

1454
01:17:26,265 --> 01:17:30,640
Now, why don't you go back
to your little tailor shop

1455
01:17:30,675 --> 01:17:33,512
and sew something?

1456
01:17:33,549 --> 01:17:36,454
Because if the Klingons
do invade this station

1457
01:17:36,489 --> 01:17:40,955
you may just need... my help.

1458
01:17:40,999 --> 01:17:43,402
Who would have thought

1459
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:46,003
that the two of us
would be fighting

1460
01:17:46,045 --> 01:17:48,643
side by side.

1461
01:17:51,090 --> 01:17:53,892
Just remember
when you fire that thing

1462
01:17:53,964 --> 01:17:56,596
you're aiming it at a Klingon.

1463
01:17:56,637 --> 01:17:59,663
I'll try to keep that in mind.

1464
01:18:12,862 --> 01:18:15,835
We're receiving a transmission
from General Martok.

1465
01:18:15,869 --> 01:18:17,498
Put him through.

1466
01:18:17,539 --> 01:18:20,068
Captain, I demand you surrender

1467
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:22,846
the Cardassian council members
to us immediately.

1468
01:18:22,886 --> 01:18:24,789
They're not Founders, Martok.

1469
01:18:24,824 --> 01:18:25,918
We tested them.

1470
01:18:25,959 --> 01:18:27,087
You were wrong.

1471
01:18:27,129 --> 01:18:29,727
It is of no consequence.

1472
01:18:29,768 --> 01:18:33,072
All that matters is
the Alpha Quadrant will be safer

1473
01:18:33,110 --> 01:18:35,947
with the Klingon Empire
in control of Cardassia.

1474
01:18:35,983 --> 01:18:39,389
Now, surrender
the council members

1475
01:18:39,425 --> 01:18:41,794
or we will have no choice
but to take them by force.

1476
01:18:41,831 --> 01:18:45,169
And risk an all-out war
with the Federation?

1477
01:18:45,206 --> 01:18:48,145
If a war starts here,
the blame will be yours.

1478
01:18:48,179 --> 01:18:50,582
I doubt very much
history will agree.

1479
01:18:50,686 --> 01:18:52,714
History is written
by the victors.

1480
01:18:52,757 --> 01:18:54,728
Consider what you're
doing, Captain.

1481
01:18:54,761 --> 01:18:58,202
The lives of everyone
on your station are at risk.

1482
01:18:58,237 --> 01:18:59,570
I am aware of that.

1483
01:18:59,607 --> 01:19:02,171
But maybe you're not aware
of what you're risking.

1484
01:19:02,213 --> 01:19:04,446
We've had a year
to prepare this station

1485
01:19:04,485 --> 01:19:07,823
for a Dominion attack,
and we're more than ready.

1486
01:19:09,430 --> 01:19:11,959
You're like a toothless
old <i>Grishnar</i> cat

1487
01:19:12,004 --> 01:19:15,102
trying to frighten us
with your roar.

1488
01:19:15,144 --> 01:19:16,773
I can assure you

1489
01:19:16,814 --> 01:19:20,585
this old cat may not be
as toothless as you think.

1490
01:19:20,624 --> 01:19:23,791
Right now, I've got
5,000 photon torpedoes

1491
01:19:23,831 --> 01:19:25,391
armed and ready to launch.

1492
01:19:25,435 --> 01:19:29,103
If you don't believe me,
feel free to scan the station.

1493
01:19:32,519 --> 01:19:33,920
It is a trick.

1494
01:19:33,956 --> 01:19:35,448
An illusion created

1495
01:19:35,492 --> 01:19:38,522
by thoron fields
and duranium shadows.

1496
01:19:38,567 --> 01:19:40,629
It's no illusion.

1497
01:19:40,739 --> 01:19:42,642
We shall see.

1498
01:19:42,710 --> 01:19:45,740
<i>CHEGH-chew jaj-VAM jaj-KAK!</i>

1499
01:19:50,528 --> 01:19:54,230
He said,
"Today is a good day to die."

1500
01:20:15,355 --> 01:20:16,847
Target the lead ships.

1501
01:20:16,892 --> 01:20:19,193
Ready even-numbered
photon launchers.

1502
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:20,324
Aye, sir.

1503
01:20:31,193 --> 01:20:32,526
Fire on my mark.

1504
01:20:34,935 --> 01:20:36,199
Fire!

1505
01:20:44,325 --> 01:20:46,319
Ready odd-numbered launchers.

1506
01:20:48,702 --> 01:20:49,692
Fire!

1507
01:20:53,847 --> 01:20:55,146
They're still closing.

1508
01:20:55,184 --> 01:20:56,585
Ready phasers.

1509
01:20:56,621 --> 01:20:57,646
Standing by.

1510
01:20:57,689 --> 01:20:58,748
Fire!

1511
01:21:07,981 --> 01:21:09,348
Eight Klingon ships destroyed.

1512
01:21:09,385 --> 01:21:10,479
Several heavily damaged.

1513
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:11,488
Contact Gowron.

1514
01:21:11,523 --> 01:21:13,357
Maybe we can put an end to this

1515
01:21:13,394 --> 01:21:15,023
before it gets any further.

1516
01:21:17,237 --> 01:21:18,729
They're not responding.

1517
01:21:21,847 --> 01:21:24,318
They have given you
your answer, Captain.

1518
01:21:24,354 --> 01:21:28,854
Weapons stations, fire at will.

1519
01:21:45,872 --> 01:21:48,070
<i>A TLING-on kaogh.</i>

1520
01:21:48,111 --> 01:21:49,375
<i>Zo a TLING-on HegH-lah.</i>

1521
01:21:49,414 --> 01:21:50,815
<i>YoD-wee KAW.</i>

1522
01:21:50,851 --> 01:21:52,218
<i>TIG-mang-Rup.</i>

1523
01:21:52,254 --> 01:21:53,814
<i>Jee-YAJ.</i>

1524
01:21:53,858 --> 01:21:56,797
<i>DuJ-va, YOD-wee-KAW!</i>

1525
01:22:07,290 --> 01:22:10,457
They've disabled
two of our shield generators.

1526
01:22:54,102 --> 01:22:55,628
Thank you, Doctor.

1527
01:22:55,672 --> 01:22:57,198
Any time.

1528
01:22:57,242 --> 01:23:02,346
I find this hand-to-hand combat
really quite distasteful.

1529
01:23:02,389 --> 01:23:03,858
I suppose you prefer
the simplicity

1530
01:23:03,892 --> 01:23:06,090
of an interrogation chamber.

1531
01:23:06,131 --> 01:23:09,298
You have to admit,
it's much more civilized.

1532
01:24:22,313 --> 01:24:23,372
Mr. O'Brien?

1533
01:24:23,416 --> 01:24:24,406
Yeah.

1534
01:24:24,451 --> 01:24:26,388
Get those shields back on line.

1535
01:24:32,203 --> 01:24:33,399
Major?

1536
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:35,240
I'll be okay.
It's not as bad as it looks.

1537
01:24:35,277 --> 01:24:36,746
Sisko to Odo.

1538
01:24:36,782 --> 01:24:37,807
Odo here.

1539
01:24:37,850 --> 01:24:38,818
Status report.

1540
01:24:38,852 --> 01:24:40,082
We have Klingon troops

1541
01:24:40,189 --> 01:24:41,749
on the Promenade,
the Habitat Ring

1542
01:24:41,794 --> 01:24:42,819
and Lower Pylon Three.

1543
01:24:42,862 --> 01:24:44,388
They seem to be
contained for now

1544
01:24:44,433 --> 01:24:46,427
but I can't guarantee
it'll stay that way.

1545
01:24:46,471 --> 01:24:47,461
Keep me informed.

1546
01:24:49,813 --> 01:24:52,445
There is another wave
of Klingon ships coming in.

1547
01:24:52,486 --> 01:24:53,785
I've got the shields back up

1548
01:24:53,822 --> 01:24:55,656
but I don't know
how long they'll hold.

1549
01:24:55,693 --> 01:24:57,926
I'm reading a cluster
of warp signatures approaching

1550
01:24:57,965 --> 01:25:00,733
bearing 187 mark 025.

1551
01:25:00,772 --> 01:25:02,071
It's Starfleet, Benjamin.

1552
01:25:02,109 --> 01:25:04,307
Six starships
led by the <i>Venture.</i>

1553
01:25:04,347 --> 01:25:06,078
They'll be here in 15 minutes.

1554
01:25:06,185 --> 01:25:09,090
Contact the <i>Negh'Var</i> again.

1555
01:25:09,192 --> 01:25:12,097
Maybe now Gowron will be
in the mood to talk.

1556
01:25:12,133 --> 01:25:13,261
I've got him.

1557
01:25:13,302 --> 01:25:15,033
Captain, your shields

1558
01:25:15,073 --> 01:25:16,599
have been weakened,
your station boarded

1559
01:25:16,643 --> 01:25:18,876
and more Klingon ships
are on their way.

1560
01:25:18,915 --> 01:25:20,384
Surrender while you can.

1561
01:25:20,419 --> 01:25:21,649
I don't think so.

1562
01:25:21,688 --> 01:25:23,089
My shields are holding.

1563
01:25:23,125 --> 01:25:25,119
Your boarding parties
are contained.

1564
01:25:25,164 --> 01:25:27,728
And my reinforcements
are closer than yours.

1565
01:25:27,770 --> 01:25:29,604
You're facing a war
on two fronts.

1566
01:25:29,641 --> 01:25:31,372
Is that what you really want?

1567
01:25:31,412 --> 01:25:33,143
The Empire is not strong enough

1568
01:25:33,250 --> 01:25:35,414
to fight the Federation
and the Cardassians.

1569
01:25:35,455 --> 01:25:37,323
End this now, Gowron

1570
01:25:37,359 --> 01:25:40,595
before you lead the Empire
to its worst defeat in history.

1571
01:25:40,634 --> 01:25:42,628
We will not surrender!

1572
01:25:42,673 --> 01:25:45,612
This is exactly
what the Founders want.

1573
01:25:45,646 --> 01:25:47,640
Klingon against Cardassian.

1574
01:25:47,685 --> 01:25:49,781
Federation against Klingon.

1575
01:25:49,823 --> 01:25:52,819
The more we fight each other,
the weaker we'll get

1576
01:25:52,864 --> 01:25:55,837
and the less chance we have
against the Dominion.

1577
01:25:55,871 --> 01:25:58,365
Consider what you do here,
Gowron.

1578
01:25:58,410 --> 01:26:00,472
Kahless himself said

1579
01:26:00,515 --> 01:26:03,959
"Destroying an Empire
to win a war is no victory."

1580
01:26:04,092 --> 01:26:07,464
"And ending a battle to save
an Empire is no defeat."

1581
01:26:07,566 --> 01:26:09,297
We can still win!

1582
01:26:09,338 --> 01:26:12,436
Not before those Starships
get here.

1583
01:26:12,478 --> 01:26:14,813
Now, what do you want me
to tell them?

1584
01:26:14,851 --> 01:26:19,157
To stand down,
or to come in firing?

1585
01:26:20,532 --> 01:26:22,730
It is we who shall stand down.

1586
01:26:22,770 --> 01:26:24,673
<i>Ach, Gowron, yay chol!</i>

1587
01:26:24,707 --> 01:26:25,675
Enough.

1588
01:26:25,710 --> 01:26:26,678
Cease fire.

1589
01:26:26,712 --> 01:26:28,409
Order our ships
in Cardassian territory

1590
01:26:28,451 --> 01:26:29,441
to halt their advance.

1591
01:26:29,486 --> 01:26:33,792
I do not intend to hand victory
to the Dominion.

1592
01:26:33,830 --> 01:26:35,356
But let your people know

1593
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:39,034
the Klingon Empire will remember
what has happened here.

1594
01:26:39,076 --> 01:26:41,776
You have sided against us
in battle

1595
01:26:41,815 --> 01:26:47,784
and this, we do not forgive...
or forget.

1596
01:26:52,641 --> 01:26:56,082
The Klingon ships
have powered down their weapons.

1597
01:26:57,754 --> 01:26:59,348
It's over.

1598
01:27:02,966 --> 01:27:04,937
For now.

1599
01:27:07,076 --> 01:27:11,075
Captain's Log, Stardate 49011.4.

1600
01:27:11,119 --> 01:27:13,956
Gowron has returned
to the Klingon Homeworld

1601
01:27:13,992 --> 01:27:17,228
and his task force has withdrawn
from Bajoran space.

1602
01:27:17,267 --> 01:27:19,967
I don't know if I can
fully express the pride I felt

1603
01:27:20,007 --> 01:27:22,069
at seeing how well
Deep Space 9 and its crew

1604
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:24,744
weathered this latest crisis.

1605
01:27:24,785 --> 01:27:27,052
Though the station
suffered heavy damage

1606
01:27:27,091 --> 01:27:28,560
during the Klingon attack

1607
01:27:28,595 --> 01:27:30,725
repairs are
well ahead of schedule

1608
01:27:30,766 --> 01:27:33,500
and life on the station is
beginning to return to normal

1609
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:37,642
leaving me with one final piece
of unfinished business.

1610
01:27:52,318 --> 01:27:54,221
Enter.

1611
01:27:56,361 --> 01:27:58,491
I brought your discharge papers.

1612
01:27:58,533 --> 01:28:00,663
I thought you might want
to take a look at them

1613
01:28:00,705 --> 01:28:02,299
before I send them off
to Starfleet.

1614
01:28:02,342 --> 01:28:03,936
Thank you, sir.

1615
01:28:05,984 --> 01:28:10,518
I understand you're headed
for the Nyberrite Alliance.

1616
01:28:10,561 --> 01:28:13,055
Yes, I leave this afternoon.

1617
01:28:14,237 --> 01:28:16,231
For me, it was a job on Earth

1618
01:28:16,275 --> 01:28:19,716
directing construction
of orbital habitats.

1619
01:28:21,688 --> 01:28:23,556
Why did you change your mind?

1620
01:28:23,593 --> 01:28:25,655
I finally realized

1621
01:28:25,698 --> 01:28:29,663
that it wasn't Starfleet
I wanted to get away from.

1622
01:28:29,774 --> 01:28:35,584
I was trying to escape the pain
I felt after my wife's death.

1623
01:28:35,621 --> 01:28:39,255
I thought I could take
the uniform

1624
01:28:39,297 --> 01:28:43,501
wrap it around that pain,
and toss them both away.

1625
01:28:43,541 --> 01:28:47,107
But it doesn't work like that.

1626
01:28:47,150 --> 01:28:50,488
Running may help,
for a little while

1627
01:28:50,524 --> 01:28:54,090
but sooner or later the pain
catches up with you

1628
01:28:54,132 --> 01:28:56,194
and the only way
to get rid of it

1629
01:28:56,237 --> 01:29:00,144
is to stand your ground
and face it.

1630
01:29:02,286 --> 01:29:04,655
But wearing that uniform
must remind you

1631
01:29:04,691 --> 01:29:06,058
of what you have lost.

1632
01:29:06,094 --> 01:29:08,692
Sometimes...

1633
01:29:08,734 --> 01:29:11,707
but it also reminds me
of what I've gained

1634
01:29:11,741 --> 01:29:13,404
and who I am.

1635
01:29:13,445 --> 01:29:16,213
Oh, I can throw away the uniform

1636
01:29:16,252 --> 01:29:19,453
resign my commission,
run all the way

1637
01:29:19,494 --> 01:29:22,467
to the Nyberrite Alliance...

1638
01:29:22,501 --> 01:29:25,099
but it really wouldn't matter.

1639
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:29,480
A Starfleet Officer...

1640
01:29:29,518 --> 01:29:31,215
that's what I am

1641
01:29:31,255 --> 01:29:33,692
and that's what I'll always be.

1642
01:29:36,601 --> 01:29:38,765
And you think that is true
of me as well.

1643
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:42,942
What's important, Mr. Worf,
is what you think.

1644
01:29:45,489 --> 01:29:48,827
I think Starfleet has been
my home for many years.

1645
01:29:50,601 --> 01:29:53,369
Perhaps it still is.

1646
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:56,609
There are starships out there

1647
01:29:56,649 --> 01:29:59,451
that are in need
of good officers.

1648
01:29:59,489 --> 01:30:03,396
In fact, the Captain of
the <i>Venture</i> is a friend of mine.

1649
01:30:03,432 --> 01:30:05,835
If you'd like,
I can talk to him

1650
01:30:05,871 --> 01:30:09,973
see if he has an opening
for a Lieutenant Commander.

1651
01:30:14,091 --> 01:30:17,327
Perhaps that
will not be necessary.

1652
01:30:28,258 --> 01:30:29,557
Lieutenant Commander Worf

1653
01:30:29,595 --> 01:30:31,623
reporting for duty, sir.

1654
01:30:31,667 --> 01:30:35,700
Well, you all know our new
Strategic Operations Officer.

1655
01:30:35,742 --> 01:30:36,710
Commander.

1656
01:30:36,745 --> 01:30:37,735
Glad you're here.

1657
01:30:37,781 --> 01:30:38,909
Thank you.
Thank you.

1658
01:30:39,017 --> 01:30:39,916
Congratulations.

1659
01:30:40,019 --> 01:30:42,388
Assume your post, Mr. Worf.

1660
01:30:42,426 --> 01:30:43,622
Yes, sir.

1661
01:30:45,199 --> 01:30:47,865
You look good in red.

1662
01:30:47,905 --> 01:30:49,568
It feels good.

1663
01:30:49,609 --> 01:30:52,673
But I have a lot to learn
about command.

1664
01:30:52,717 --> 01:30:55,246
Well, you couldn't ask
for a better teacher.

1665
01:30:58,030 --> 01:31:00,901
Now that everyone is here,
I wanted you to know

1666
01:31:00,937 --> 01:31:02,304
I've spoken with Dukat

1667
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:04,904
and several members
of the Detapa Council.

1668
01:31:04,946 --> 01:31:08,113
They've returned to Cardassia
Prime without incident

1669
01:31:08,154 --> 01:31:11,424
and wanted me to convey to you
their personal thanks.

1670
01:31:12,965 --> 01:31:15,529
Who'd have thought I'd help
save the Cardassian government?

1671
01:31:15,571 --> 01:31:16,801
Don't worry.

1672
01:31:16,841 --> 01:31:19,814
I'm sure Gul Dukat
will take all the credit.

1673
01:31:19,848 --> 01:31:21,511
Poor Garak... Dukat's a hero

1674
01:31:21,552 --> 01:31:25,323
and Garak's still stuck in his
tailor shop hemming trousers.

1675
01:31:25,362 --> 01:31:28,392
Captain, I'm receiving
a priority one message

1676
01:31:28,435 --> 01:31:30,132
from Starfleet Intelligence.

1677
01:31:30,173 --> 01:31:32,303
The Klingons are refusing
to give up

1678
01:31:32,345 --> 01:31:34,407
several
of the Cardassian colonies

1679
01:31:34,449 --> 01:31:36,386
they seized during the invasion.

1680
01:31:36,421 --> 01:31:38,619
They're fortifying
their positions

1681
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:41,656
and deploying
orbital defense systems.

1682
01:31:41,701 --> 01:31:44,674
Looks like the Klingons
are here to stay.

1683
01:31:51,390 --> 01:31:53,224
Maybe they are...

1684
01:31:54,899 --> 01:31:56,733
but so are we.
