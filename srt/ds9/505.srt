1
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:04,167
You know, Morn

2
00:00:04,201 --> 00:00:05,500
there's nothing
more invigorating

3
00:00:05,537 --> 00:00:06,664
than breakfast in a bar.

4
00:00:06,706 --> 00:00:09,041
Where else can you
get raw slug liver

5
00:00:09,078 --> 00:00:10,411
first thing in the morning?

6
00:00:10,448 --> 00:00:13,615
Mmm, mmm.

7
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:22,934
What's this?

8
00:00:22,976 --> 00:00:24,639
What do you mean, "what's this?"

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,206
It's puree of beetle.

10
00:00:26,249 --> 00:00:27,843
I didn't order it.

11
00:00:27,886 --> 00:00:29,321
Of course you didn't order it.

12
00:00:29,356 --> 00:00:30,585
You don't need to order it.

13
00:00:30,626 --> 00:00:33,325
You have it after work
every morning.

14
00:00:33,365 --> 00:00:37,066
Well, I'm not having it
this morning.

15
00:00:37,106 --> 00:00:39,076
I'd like...

16
00:00:40,948 --> 00:00:42,645
two eggs over easy,
three strips of bacon

17
00:00:42,685 --> 00:00:44,052
and a side of corned beef hash.

18
00:00:45,057 --> 00:00:46,890
What kind of breakfast is that?

19
00:00:46,928 --> 00:00:49,729
It's Chief O'Brien's
breakfast of choice.

20
00:00:51,939 --> 00:00:54,969
That's the problem
with working alongside hu-mans...

21
00:00:55,012 --> 00:00:57,711
you pick up
their disgusting habits.

22
00:00:57,752 --> 00:00:58,742
Bacon...

23
00:00:58,787 --> 00:01:01,588
corned beef hash.

24
00:01:01,627 --> 00:01:03,791
What's next, Rom?

25
00:01:03,832 --> 00:01:06,201
Orange juice and coffee?

26
00:01:06,237 --> 00:01:07,466
That might be nice.

27
00:01:09,644 --> 00:01:11,842
I don't understand.

28
00:01:11,883 --> 00:01:15,618
You gave up
a perfectly good job with me

29
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:19,257
to work on the station's
waste extraction system?

30
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:21,668
A good waste extraction system
is important.

31
00:01:21,704 --> 00:01:23,469
Imagine where we'd be
without one.

32
00:01:23,508 --> 00:01:25,638
Of course it's important,
but my point is

33
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,676
you're not getting
the choice assignments.

34
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,524
O'Brien's got you
on the night shift

35
00:01:32,562 --> 00:01:35,729
doing all the work
nobody else wants to do.

36
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:37,466
I like my work.

37
00:01:37,506 --> 00:01:40,775
You like standing all night long

38
00:01:40,813 --> 00:01:42,977
knee-deep in waste

39
00:01:43,017 --> 00:01:45,545
fixing some broken
flow regulator

40
00:01:45,591 --> 00:01:47,561
when you could be here

41
00:01:47,595 --> 00:01:53,131
staring at half-naked
dabo girls?

42
00:01:58,385 --> 00:01:59,718
I have a good job.

43
00:01:59,755 --> 00:02:01,851
I'm proud of the work I do

44
00:02:01,893 --> 00:02:04,558
and I know that one day

45
00:02:04,598 --> 00:02:07,537
Chief O'Brien will recognize
my efforts

46
00:02:07,572 --> 00:02:10,066
and reward me
with a position of respect

47
00:02:10,111 --> 00:02:12,275
and responsibility, and why?

48
00:02:12,316 --> 00:02:15,083
Because that's just
the way things are

49
00:02:15,122 --> 00:02:16,317
in Engineering.

50
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:21,027
I'm sorry I brought it up.

51
00:02:29,486 --> 00:02:31,353
They don't look so fine now.

52
00:02:31,424 --> 00:02:32,357
I can't understand it.

53
00:02:32,427 --> 00:02:34,363
I followed Keiko's instructions
to the letter.

54
00:02:34,397 --> 00:02:35,365
They were dry as a bone

55
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:36,834
when I came by
for you yesterday.

56
00:02:36,869 --> 00:02:37,859
I mean, I gave them water.

57
00:02:37,905 --> 00:02:39,204
I just don't think
it was enough.

58
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:41,108
You watered them?

59
00:02:41,145 --> 00:02:43,378
These are Idran hybrids.

60
00:02:43,484 --> 00:02:45,283
Too much water rots their roots.

61
00:02:45,321 --> 00:02:46,289
Oh.

62
00:02:49,263 --> 00:02:51,199
Mommy's going to be mad.

63
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,599
I can't believe it.

64
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:57,375
Keiko's gone five days
and we kill her plants.

65
00:02:57,415 --> 00:02:58,884
She'll understand, won't she?

66
00:02:58,917 --> 00:03:00,546
I mean, after all,
they're just plants.

67
00:03:00,588 --> 00:03:02,148
They're not just plants.

68
00:03:02,191 --> 00:03:05,187
These are her bonsai trees.

69
00:03:05,232 --> 00:03:07,202
She's cared for them,
and nurtured them

70
00:03:07,236 --> 00:03:10,698
and carefully sculpted
their growth for months...

71
00:03:10,744 --> 00:03:11,712
years.

72
00:03:11,746 --> 00:03:13,181
You're in trouble.

73
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:18,553
Listen, Molly, I think you and I

74
00:03:18,594 --> 00:03:22,159
should both go to the airlock
and welcome Mommy back

75
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,503
and then after we've
hugged and kissed and...

76
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,637
you can tell her what happened.

77
00:03:26,679 --> 00:03:28,205
Not me.

78
00:03:29,785 --> 00:03:31,812
Well, don't look at me.

79
00:03:31,857 --> 00:03:33,690
Well, you killed her plants.

80
00:03:33,728 --> 00:03:35,322
We killed them.

81
00:03:35,364 --> 00:03:37,391
But I think you're overreacting
to the situation.

82
00:03:37,436 --> 00:03:38,700
I mean, Keiko will forgive you.

83
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:40,402
It's your birthday today,
isn't it?

84
00:03:40,442 --> 00:03:42,207
Yeah, so far, it's one
I'd like to forget.

85
00:03:42,246 --> 00:03:44,342
Well, she's been away on Bajor.

86
00:03:44,384 --> 00:03:46,878
She's missed you.

87
00:03:46,923 --> 00:03:47,891
Bring her a gift.

88
00:03:47,925 --> 00:03:49,986
What kind of chocolates
does she like?

89
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,659
Tellurian mint truffles

90
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:53,728
but I still think
you should be with me.

91
00:03:53,772 --> 00:03:55,264
You don't need me there.

92
00:03:55,308 --> 00:03:58,247
I've seen you handle your wife
thousands of times.

93
00:03:58,282 --> 00:03:59,375
Just say you're sorry

94
00:03:59,417 --> 00:04:01,284
and that you take
full responsibility.

95
00:04:01,321 --> 00:04:03,519
You'll be fine.

96
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,430
Besides, I, uh...
have to be in surgery...

97
00:04:06,499 --> 00:04:07,432
operating.

98
00:04:07,502 --> 00:04:08,766
On who?

99
00:04:08,805 --> 00:04:10,034
I'll find someone.

100
00:04:23,537 --> 00:04:24,972
It was Julian.

101
00:04:25,007 --> 00:04:26,636
He was trying to be helpful.

102
00:04:26,678 --> 00:04:27,977
He over-watered them.

103
00:04:28,013 --> 00:04:29,676
It's not his fault.

104
00:04:29,717 --> 00:04:31,414
You know how he is.

105
00:04:31,454 --> 00:04:33,515
Sometimes he doesn't even
know what he's doing.

106
00:04:35,029 --> 00:04:36,794
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

107
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,735
We'll buy some new ones.

108
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,207
Forget it, Miles.
They're just plants.

109
00:04:41,243 --> 00:04:42,837
Exactly.

110
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,075
It's not as if

111
00:04:44,116 --> 00:04:46,212
something happened
to Molly or the baby.

112
00:04:46,254 --> 00:04:47,723
Right, right.

113
00:04:47,757 --> 00:04:50,924
I mean, everybody's fine.
No problems.

114
00:04:50,964 --> 00:04:51,932
Good.

115
00:04:51,966 --> 00:04:53,059
What about Kira?

116
00:04:53,102 --> 00:04:54,092
Is she back yet?

117
00:04:54,138 --> 00:04:56,336
No, she's still with Shakaar.

118
00:04:56,376 --> 00:04:58,540
They're traveling around
Dahkur Province.

119
00:04:58,648 --> 00:04:59,947
I thought you were
going to visit them.

120
00:04:59,984 --> 00:05:01,681
I didn't get a chance.

121
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:04,192
So, how are the Fire Caves?

122
00:05:04,227 --> 00:05:05,252
Fine.

123
00:05:05,296 --> 00:05:09,932
And now it's time for me
to tell you some news.

124
00:05:09,973 --> 00:05:12,034
I'm not Keiko.

125
00:05:14,883 --> 00:05:16,182
No?

126
00:05:16,219 --> 00:05:18,884
Who are you?

127
00:05:20,228 --> 00:05:22,027
Listen carefully, Miles.

128
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:25,506
I have taken possession
of your wife's body.

129
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,476
I will hold it hostage

130
00:05:27,511 --> 00:05:30,244
until you do everything
I tell you to

131
00:05:30,284 --> 00:05:32,345
accurately,
and without question.

132
00:05:32,388 --> 00:05:35,452
Hmm... everything?

133
00:05:35,495 --> 00:05:37,124
If you don't do
precisely what I ask

134
00:05:37,165 --> 00:05:38,429
I'll kill your wife.

135
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,201
Are you all right?

136
00:05:43,078 --> 00:05:44,570
Maybe there's
been an outbreak

137
00:05:44,615 --> 00:05:46,380
of Rudellian brain
fever on Bajor.

138
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:48,082
We should go see Julian...

139
00:05:48,123 --> 00:05:49,558
I see I'm going
to have to give you

140
00:05:49,593 --> 00:05:50,960
a demonstration
of my sincerity.

141
00:05:53,969 --> 00:05:54,732
Keiko!

142
00:05:59,314 --> 00:06:00,475
Keiko!

143
00:06:02,688 --> 00:06:04,385
No.

144
00:06:05,394 --> 00:06:06,453
No, Miles.

145
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:07,691
You're not telling anyone.

146
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:09,600
If you do, I'll stop
her heart forever.

147
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:11,348
If you're really
in control my wife's body

148
00:08:11,393 --> 00:08:12,794
let me speak to her.

149
00:08:12,829 --> 00:08:15,300
She can hear
whatever you have to say.

150
00:08:15,335 --> 00:08:16,325
Not good enough.

151
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,135
I want to talk to her.

152
00:08:18,174 --> 00:08:20,201
I want her to talk to me.

153
00:08:20,246 --> 00:08:23,219
You're in no position
to bargain, Miles.

154
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:26,817
Strange, these corporeal
bodies of yours... so fragile.

155
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,730
Burst even a tiny blood vessel
in the brain

156
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:31,235
and every memory

157
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:35,005
every passionate emotion...
gone forever.

158
00:08:35,044 --> 00:08:38,677
You really shouldn't let me
eat all these by myself, Miles.

159
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,189
I'm not hungry.

160
00:08:40,223 --> 00:08:42,524
Look, why don't you just tell me
what it is you want me to do

161
00:08:42,561 --> 00:08:43,688
so we can get this over with.

162
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:44,960
Very well.

163
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,765
But let me make one thing clear:

164
00:08:46,803 --> 00:08:49,799
I will not do anything
to jeopardize this station

165
00:08:49,844 --> 00:08:51,073
or the people on it.

166
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:52,413
Don't worry, Miles.

167
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,385
All I want you to do
is reconfigure

168
00:08:54,421 --> 00:08:55,856
some of the communication

169
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,450
and sensor relays
on the station.

170
00:08:57,494 --> 00:08:58,621
Why?

171
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,656
I can't tell you.

172
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,144
You'll have to be patient.

173
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,082
The communications
and sensor relays

174
00:09:08,117 --> 00:09:10,281
are distributed throughout
the entire station.

175
00:09:12,895 --> 00:09:15,332
You know your wife
well, Miles

176
00:09:15,367 --> 00:09:16,596
but she knows you even better.

177
00:09:16,636 --> 00:09:18,105
I know you're just
playing for time

178
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:19,631
until you can get
to your friends...

179
00:09:19,676 --> 00:09:22,979
Julian, Dax, Captain Sisko.

180
00:09:23,017 --> 00:09:24,543
I know they'll all
want to help you.

181
00:09:24,587 --> 00:09:27,115
The Captain may even allow you
to do what I'm asking

182
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:30,029
at least
until someone figures out

183
00:09:30,065 --> 00:09:31,898
a way to catch me
in some sort of stasis field

184
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,943
or some other clever device
you're already dreaming up.

185
00:09:36,948 --> 00:09:39,351
And you know what?
It might work.

186
00:09:39,385 --> 00:09:41,618
You might be able to stop me

187
00:09:41,657 --> 00:09:43,924
but I promise you one thing:

188
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:45,794
If you do, Keiko will die.

189
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,931
All I need is a split second

190
00:09:49,007 --> 00:09:51,740
to cause a massive
brain hemorrhage, and...

191
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:53,408
she's gone.

192
00:09:57,325 --> 00:09:59,796
I know this is a difficult
adjustment for you to make

193
00:09:59,831 --> 00:10:01,596
but we don't have a lot of time.

194
00:10:03,272 --> 00:10:05,333
What do you want me to do?

195
00:10:06,345 --> 00:10:07,939
How long is this going to take?

196
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,510
In order to keep
the polarity shift

197
00:10:10,555 --> 00:10:13,995
invisible to security checks,
I'm going to have to tap

198
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:16,660
into the optronic integrator
on Level Five.

199
00:10:16,701 --> 00:10:17,794
You're the engineer.

200
00:10:21,445 --> 00:10:23,472
What is it, Miles?

201
00:10:23,516 --> 00:10:25,646
What do you want to ask me?

202
00:10:25,688 --> 00:10:27,555
You always tighten
your brow just a tiny bit

203
00:10:27,592 --> 00:10:29,756
whenever you're about
to ask a question.

204
00:10:29,797 --> 00:10:31,995
It's something
only a wife would notice.

205
00:10:32,035 --> 00:10:33,595
Why Keiko?

206
00:10:33,638 --> 00:10:35,540
Why take control of her?
Why not me?

207
00:10:35,576 --> 00:10:37,341
I'm the one who can do the work.

208
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,872
It would be more efficient.

209
00:10:42,926 --> 00:10:43,916
Come in.

210
00:10:45,999 --> 00:10:48,060
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

211
00:10:48,137 --> 00:10:49,663
Yes, you are.
We're busy.

212
00:10:49,707 --> 00:10:51,940
Miles, don't be so rude.

213
00:10:51,978 --> 00:10:54,848
Aw, Bajoran spiny basil...
how thoughtful.

214
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,089
It's the least
I could do after...

215
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:00,596
Oh, it's all right, Julian.

216
00:11:00,631 --> 00:11:01,930
I forgive you.

217
00:11:01,967 --> 00:11:03,698
Now, you are coming
to the party tonight

218
00:11:03,738 --> 00:11:04,706
aren't you?

219
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,867
I'll be here.

220
00:11:05,909 --> 00:11:08,005
I guess it's not
a surprise anymore.

221
00:11:08,048 --> 00:11:10,246
Oh, I can't believe
I did that.

222
00:11:10,285 --> 00:11:12,586
I arranged a birthday
dinner for you tonight

223
00:11:12,624 --> 00:11:15,061
but I wanted it
to be a surprise.

224
00:11:15,129 --> 00:11:17,031
Well, that's okay.

225
00:11:17,068 --> 00:11:19,562
I... I don't like surprises.

226
00:11:19,606 --> 00:11:21,075
Well, I better be going.

227
00:11:21,109 --> 00:11:23,307
I left a patient
on the operating table.

228
00:11:23,348 --> 00:11:24,908
I'll see you later.

229
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:26,443
Thanks, Julian.

230
00:11:26,488 --> 00:11:27,821
This was so sweet.

231
00:11:27,857 --> 00:11:28,847
No problem.

232
00:11:34,238 --> 00:11:35,969
A party? Tonight?

233
00:11:36,008 --> 00:11:37,443
It is your birthday.

234
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:39,073
We can't have
all those people here.

235
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:40,084
We'll have to cancel.

236
00:11:40,118 --> 00:11:42,088
And raise suspicions?

237
00:11:42,123 --> 00:11:44,219
It's better if the dinner
goes on as planned.

238
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,387
Besides, Keiko

239
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,958
went to a lot of trouble
to arrange it for you.

240
00:11:48,002 --> 00:11:50,303
Now, you better
get back to work.

241
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,834
You don't want to be late
for your shift briefing

242
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,043
and I've got a lot
of cooking to do.

243
00:12:10,819 --> 00:12:15,124
Diagnostic and Repair Technician
Junior Grade Rom reporting.

244
00:12:15,195 --> 00:12:17,826
Right. You're Duarte's
replacement. Have a seat.

245
00:12:17,867 --> 00:12:20,498
I'm on the swing shift?

246
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,975
For a day or two.

247
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:24,310
What's the matter with Duarte?

248
00:12:24,348 --> 00:12:26,341
Sick as a vole.

249
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:31,897
Is this where Duarte sits?

250
00:12:33,903 --> 00:12:35,736
So, what are you drinking?

251
00:12:35,773 --> 00:12:37,072
<i>Raktajino.</i>

252
00:12:37,109 --> 00:12:38,578
Great.

253
00:12:38,613 --> 00:12:42,418
Is that what we drink
on the swing shift?

254
00:12:42,455 --> 00:12:44,619
You can drink
anything you want.

255
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:47,426
I'll have a <i>raktajino.</i>

256
00:12:50,272 --> 00:12:52,208
It's not like this
on the night shift.

257
00:12:52,243 --> 00:12:54,441
We don't drink <i>raktajino.</i>

258
00:12:56,184 --> 00:12:57,983
We really don't drink anything.

259
00:12:58,023 --> 00:12:59,549
Fascinating.

260
00:12:59,592 --> 00:13:01,585
Change of plans today, people.

261
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:04,762
I need to recalibrate
the optronic integrator

262
00:13:04,804 --> 00:13:06,273
on Level Five.

263
00:13:06,307 --> 00:13:08,174
What is it, Rom?

264
00:13:08,211 --> 00:13:09,680
I volunteer.

265
00:13:09,715 --> 00:13:11,845
I like phase-shifting
reconfigurations.

266
00:13:11,886 --> 00:13:13,856
Thank you, but I'll
take care of that myself.

267
00:13:13,891 --> 00:13:15,086
I want the rest of you

268
00:13:15,126 --> 00:13:17,495
to concentrate
on the new inertial couplings.

269
00:13:17,532 --> 00:13:20,528
I want all 64 couplings
done today.

270
00:13:20,572 --> 00:13:24,775
Watley, you and Tekoa
cover the docking ring.

271
00:13:24,815 --> 00:13:27,082
Abdon and Nori, the cargo bays.

272
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:29,180
Rom, the upper pylons.

273
00:13:29,224 --> 00:13:30,419
Any questions?

274
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,655
Good.

275
00:13:31,696 --> 00:13:33,359
Now, since I'll be
working alone today

276
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,233
I'm going to be very busy,
so I don't want

277
00:13:35,337 --> 00:13:37,239
to be interrupted
by anything unimportant.

278
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:38,243
Is that clear?

279
00:13:38,344 --> 00:13:39,677
Yes, sir.

280
00:13:51,305 --> 00:13:55,269
Computer...
Locate Keiko O'Brien.

281
00:13:55,314 --> 00:13:59,551
Keiko O'Brien is
in her quarters.

282
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:04,533
Computer, initiate full
identity scan of Keiko O'Brien

283
00:14:04,568 --> 00:14:07,939
and note any inconsistencies
with existing medical records.

284
00:14:10,114 --> 00:14:12,813
Scan complete.
No inconsistencies found.

285
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:15,620
Identity confirmed.

286
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:20,500
How long would it take
a level-3 stasis field

287
00:14:20,536 --> 00:14:23,269
to render Keiko O'Brien
unconscious?

288
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:26,772
All cognitive reflexes
would cease in 2.1 seconds.

289
00:14:26,817 --> 00:14:28,309
Too long.

290
00:14:30,325 --> 00:14:33,696
Calculate the time
if anesthetine gas were used.

291
00:14:33,732 --> 00:14:36,830
1.4 seconds.

292
00:14:36,873 --> 00:14:39,003
What about a phaser set on stun?

293
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,345
0.9 seconds.

294
00:14:46,426 --> 00:14:48,259
God help me.

295
00:15:14,593 --> 00:15:15,788
There you are, Chief.

296
00:15:15,897 --> 00:15:17,058
I was beginning to think

297
00:15:17,099 --> 00:15:18,500
you were going to miss
your own party.

298
00:15:18,536 --> 00:15:19,504
I'm sorry I'm late.

299
00:15:19,538 --> 00:15:20,973
I had a few odds
and ends to tie up.

300
00:15:21,008 --> 00:15:21,976
Have you seen Keiko?

301
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,103
Oh, she's in the bedroom

302
00:15:23,145 --> 00:15:24,444
helping Molly try on
different shoes...

303
00:15:24,482 --> 00:15:25,609
a little fashion crisis.

304
00:15:25,651 --> 00:15:27,314
But as usual, your wife
has handled everything.

305
00:15:27,355 --> 00:15:28,722
You're a lucky man, Miles.

306
00:15:28,758 --> 00:15:31,662
Keiko has really
outdone herself this time.

307
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:33,224
Take it from an old cook...

308
00:15:33,268 --> 00:15:36,001
Q'parol is a very
time-consuming dish.

309
00:15:37,043 --> 00:15:38,569
Happy birthday, Daddy!

310
00:15:38,613 --> 00:15:39,672
For...

311
00:15:39,715 --> 00:15:42,482
He's a jolly good fellow

312
00:15:42,522 --> 00:15:45,825
For he's a jolly good fellow

313
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:49,998
For he's
a jolly good fellow

314
00:15:50,038 --> 00:15:53,136
Which nobody can deny.

315
00:15:53,178 --> 00:15:55,308
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

316
00:15:56,787 --> 00:15:58,188
Make a wish.

317
00:16:04,236 --> 00:16:08,473
Single malt Irish whiskey.
Neat.

318
00:16:08,512 --> 00:16:12,077
Molly wanted to wear
her new purple shoes for you.

319
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,349
Doesn't she look pretty?

320
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,483
Very pretty.

321
00:16:14,525 --> 00:16:16,256
Now all the food's set out
on the table

322
00:16:16,296 --> 00:16:19,428
so just relax with your friends
and I'll pass these around.

323
00:16:23,946 --> 00:16:25,175
I want to talk to you.

324
00:16:25,216 --> 00:16:27,015
Not right now, Miles.
We have guests.

325
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:29,983
Sorry I'm late.

326
00:16:30,026 --> 00:16:32,691
Dax, I was afraid
you weren't coming.

327
00:16:32,732 --> 00:16:34,463
Well, I heard you
were serving Q'parol

328
00:16:34,503 --> 00:16:35,698
and how could I miss it?

329
00:16:41,719 --> 00:16:43,313
What's the matter, Chief?

330
00:16:43,356 --> 00:16:44,381
You look a little preoccupied.

331
00:16:44,424 --> 00:16:45,392
Everything all right?

332
00:16:45,426 --> 00:16:47,727
Well, there's, um...

333
00:16:47,765 --> 00:16:49,895
there's something
I forgot to tell Keiko.

334
00:16:49,936 --> 00:16:51,165
Would you excuse me
for a moment?

335
00:16:51,206 --> 00:16:52,470
Of course.

336
00:16:56,417 --> 00:16:57,886
Did you see any Pah-wraiths?

337
00:16:57,921 --> 00:16:58,889
Pah-wraiths?

338
00:16:58,923 --> 00:17:00,118
In the Fire Caves.

339
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,494
Odo was telling me the Caves
were haunted by some

340
00:17:02,531 --> 00:17:04,194
sort of weird
supernatural beings.

341
00:17:04,235 --> 00:17:06,638
Don't tell me you believe
in wraiths.

342
00:17:06,674 --> 00:17:09,475
Well, I may have mentioned
the Bajoran legends

343
00:17:09,513 --> 00:17:11,312
about creatures living
in the caves

344
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,685
but I never said
I believe in them.

345
00:17:13,722 --> 00:17:15,521
Well, the only thing
I saw in the caves

346
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:18,555
were some beautiful and
botanically fascinating fungi.

347
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,901
Well, maybe the next time

348
00:17:20,938 --> 00:17:22,430
you go to the Fire Caves,
I could come along.

349
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:24,911
I've always wanted
to meet a Pah-wraith.

350
00:17:24,946 --> 00:17:27,076
Maybe you will.
You never know.

351
00:17:27,118 --> 00:17:28,245
I've done what you asked.

352
00:17:28,287 --> 00:17:29,586
That's terrific, Miles.

353
00:17:29,624 --> 00:17:30,751
We'll talk later.

354
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:35,226
Can I have cake now?

355
00:17:35,269 --> 00:17:37,239
Oh, in a bit, sweetie.

356
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:43,153
Miles, are you bleeding?

357
00:17:43,186 --> 00:17:44,985
No. It's... it's nothing.

358
00:17:45,091 --> 00:17:46,252
Let me take a look.

359
00:17:46,293 --> 00:17:47,592
I said I'm all right!

360
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:53,299
I'm sorry.

361
00:17:53,342 --> 00:17:55,677
I'm sorry, everybody.

362
00:17:55,714 --> 00:17:57,513
Excuse me.

363
00:18:08,409 --> 00:18:10,208
Get ahold of yourself.

364
00:18:14,188 --> 00:18:16,989
Look, I've done everything
you've asked me to do.

365
00:18:17,061 --> 00:18:18,792
Just give me back my wife.

366
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:20,267
You've done well, Miles

367
00:18:20,302 --> 00:18:24,209
but recalibrating the optronic
integrator was only a test.

368
00:18:24,244 --> 00:18:26,647
I had to be sure
I could trust you.

369
00:18:26,682 --> 00:18:29,552
Tomorrow the real work begins.

370
00:18:29,589 --> 00:18:32,790
Now it's time to get back
to our guests.

371
00:18:32,829 --> 00:18:34,765
We don't want
to raise suspicions, do we?

372
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,971
Is Molly asleep?

373
00:18:56,014 --> 00:18:57,415
Yes.

374
00:18:57,449 --> 00:18:59,613
The Q'parol was a huge success.

375
00:19:03,129 --> 00:19:05,362
Look, no more tests,
no more games.

376
00:19:05,401 --> 00:19:07,428
Just tell me what you want done.

377
00:19:07,471 --> 00:19:09,464
We'll talk about it
in the morning.

378
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:12,745
It's late and you're working
a double shift tomorrow.

379
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:14,310
I want to talk about it now!

380
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:17,521
Miles, I make the rules.

381
00:19:18,997 --> 00:19:20,466
Now relax.

382
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,962
Everything's going to be fine
as long as you do what I ask.

383
00:19:26,113 --> 00:19:28,174
I'll sleep on the couch.

384
00:19:28,217 --> 00:19:30,620
Don't be childish.

385
00:19:30,656 --> 00:19:32,091
What if Molly has one
of her nightmares

386
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:33,788
and comes running in?

387
00:19:37,537 --> 00:19:41,238
You'll sleep in bed with me
just like you always do.

388
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:44,448
I'll be there in a minute.

389
00:19:44,487 --> 00:19:45,751
Don't be too late.

390
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:47,782
You've got a busy day tomorrow.

391
00:19:56,413 --> 00:19:57,814
Computer...

392
00:19:59,185 --> 00:20:02,124
give me the record
of all Bajoran legends

393
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,790
concerning the Pah-wraiths.

394
00:20:04,831 --> 00:20:08,795
There are 6,427 entries
in the data banks

395
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,639
that reference that subject.

396
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:12,442
Please specify.

397
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,944
Miles?

398
00:20:29,318 --> 00:20:31,311
Sleep well.

399
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:07,636
Another weakness
of you corporeal life-forms...

400
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:10,642
your need for physical intimacy.

401
00:21:10,676 --> 00:21:13,147
It's especially irritating
in your young.

402
00:21:13,181 --> 00:21:15,618
I have to get Molly
ready for school.

403
00:21:15,653 --> 00:21:18,216
I'll do it.
You have a big day ahead of you.

404
00:21:18,259 --> 00:21:20,389
Molly is going to sleep over
at the Davis' tonight

405
00:21:20,431 --> 00:21:22,527
and she's staying there
until this is over.

406
00:21:22,568 --> 00:21:24,265
You really think that's wise?

407
00:21:24,372 --> 00:21:26,069
A little girl needs her mother.

408
00:21:26,109 --> 00:21:27,908
Molly would be lost
without hers.

409
00:21:27,947 --> 00:21:29,576
You stay away from her.

410
00:21:29,618 --> 00:21:32,682
Miles, I'd never do anything
to hurt your daughter...

411
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:34,888
unless you force me to.

412
00:21:37,268 --> 00:21:39,238
These are your instructions.

413
00:21:39,272 --> 00:21:40,935
Follow them precisely.

414
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,529
Computer, locate Captain Sisko.

415
00:21:52,568 --> 00:21:55,233
Captain Sisko is in Security.

416
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,245
Miles?

417
00:22:16,887 --> 00:22:17,513
No!

418
00:22:27,495 --> 00:22:31,026
And you didn't see anyone
near her before she fell?

419
00:22:31,069 --> 00:22:35,204
Nobody, but I was passing
underneath the walkway

420
00:22:35,245 --> 00:22:37,078
and I had my back toward her.

421
00:22:37,117 --> 00:22:38,643
What were you doing
on the Promenade?

422
00:22:38,686 --> 00:22:39,654
What?

423
00:22:39,689 --> 00:22:40,850
Weren't you supposed
to be working

424
00:22:40,891 --> 00:22:43,260
on optronic circuitry
on Level Five?

425
00:22:43,296 --> 00:22:46,599
I was going to the Replimat
for lunch.

426
00:22:46,637 --> 00:22:48,072
Keiko is going to be all right.

427
00:22:48,107 --> 00:22:49,940
She's lucky that she landed
the way that she did.

428
00:22:49,978 --> 00:22:51,572
It distributed the impact.

429
00:22:51,615 --> 00:22:53,084
Otherwise, a fall
from that height

430
00:22:53,118 --> 00:22:54,382
could easily have killed her

431
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,581
or left her paralyzed.

432
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,592
Is she conscious?

433
00:22:56,626 --> 00:22:58,493
Yes, but she's still in shock.

434
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:00,329
She has a broken femur
and a hairline fracture

435
00:23:00,367 --> 00:23:01,859
of the right parietal lobe.

436
00:23:01,904 --> 00:23:03,031
Can I see her?

437
00:23:03,073 --> 00:23:05,340
Maybe in a couple of hours.

438
00:23:05,378 --> 00:23:06,539
Right now, she needs to rest.

439
00:23:06,581 --> 00:23:07,640
Julian...

440
00:23:07,716 --> 00:23:09,413
I really need to see her now.

441
00:23:09,453 --> 00:23:10,786
Doctor.

442
00:23:13,129 --> 00:23:14,496
All right...

443
00:23:14,531 --> 00:23:16,330
but only for a few minutes.

444
00:23:16,369 --> 00:23:18,465
Don't excite her.

445
00:23:31,168 --> 00:23:33,161
Keiko?

446
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:37,413
You were going
to tell them about me.

447
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:39,180
How did you know?

448
00:23:39,219 --> 00:23:41,816
I know everything
your wife knows

449
00:23:41,858 --> 00:23:43,487
and she knows you.

450
00:23:43,528 --> 00:23:46,056
I told you we have
to trust one another.

451
00:23:46,101 --> 00:23:47,934
You violated that trust.

452
00:23:47,972 --> 00:23:49,839
Now look where it's led us.

453
00:23:49,876 --> 00:23:52,712
I want my wife back,
do you hear? I want her...

454
00:23:52,749 --> 00:23:54,412
Then stop trying to fool me.

455
00:23:54,452 --> 00:23:57,049
How much more damage do you
think this body can take?

456
00:23:58,595 --> 00:23:59,722
Now...

457
00:23:59,765 --> 00:24:01,394
no more tricks.

458
00:24:01,435 --> 00:24:02,768
Agreed?

459
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:07,837
Say it.

460
00:24:09,687 --> 00:24:10,882
Agreed.

461
00:24:10,922 --> 00:24:12,221
Good.

462
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:13,728
You know what you need to do.

463
00:24:13,795 --> 00:24:15,287
You should get back to work.

464
00:24:15,332 --> 00:24:17,997
I'll have everything completed
in 36 hours.

465
00:24:18,038 --> 00:24:20,509
You have 13
and not a minute more.

466
00:24:20,544 --> 00:24:22,343
I can't do it that fast.

467
00:24:22,381 --> 00:24:24,648
You're a very resourceful man.

468
00:24:24,686 --> 00:24:26,850
I'm sure you can find a way...

469
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:28,860
for Keiko's sake.

470
00:24:28,895 --> 00:24:30,865
You bloody...

471
00:24:30,899 --> 00:24:33,700
She does need to rest, Chief.

472
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:35,606
Tell Molly I'll be home soon.

473
00:24:35,643 --> 00:24:37,374
Tell her Mommy's fine.

474
00:24:37,414 --> 00:24:40,045
Don't scare her.

475
00:24:40,086 --> 00:24:41,715
Miles...

476
00:24:41,757 --> 00:24:43,750
give me a kiss.

477
00:24:55,386 --> 00:24:57,379
I'm counting on you.

478
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:02,395
She'll be back on her feet soon,
I promise.

479
00:25:04,974 --> 00:25:07,878
Computer, begin a 13-hour
countdown, starting now.

480
00:25:07,914 --> 00:25:09,383
Clock activated.

481
00:25:09,417 --> 00:25:10,886
Chief.

482
00:25:10,921 --> 00:25:13,552
I heard about Keiko's accident.

483
00:25:13,593 --> 00:25:14,561
How is she?

484
00:25:14,595 --> 00:25:16,588
Julian said she'll be home soon.

485
00:25:16,633 --> 00:25:17,760
That is good.

486
00:25:17,802 --> 00:25:19,795
If there is anything
I can do...

487
00:25:19,841 --> 00:25:21,902
I wish there was.

488
00:25:21,945 --> 00:25:24,246
I really do.

489
00:25:24,283 --> 00:25:25,912
I'd better get going.

490
00:25:25,954 --> 00:25:28,050
I'm falling behind schedule.

491
00:25:34,974 --> 00:25:36,773
Computer, time remaining?

492
00:25:36,811 --> 00:25:39,978
Eight hours, 22 minutes,
three seconds.

493
00:25:49,572 --> 00:25:50,540
Chief!

494
00:25:51,577 --> 00:25:52,545
Sorry.

495
00:25:52,579 --> 00:25:54,378
I didn't mean to startle you.

496
00:25:54,416 --> 00:25:55,885
Rom, what are you doing here?

497
00:25:55,953 --> 00:25:58,424
Reporting
for my next assignment.

498
00:25:58,458 --> 00:26:00,519
I've completed
calibration tests

499
00:26:00,563 --> 00:26:03,559
on the inertial coupling ports
on all three upper pylons.

500
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:04,662
Already?

501
00:26:16,732 --> 00:26:18,497
How did you finish so quickly?

502
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:20,597
I just did the work.

503
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,111
I didn't allow myself
to get caught up

504
00:26:23,145 --> 00:26:25,012
in any of the
distracting discussions

505
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,146
the other workers engage in.

506
00:26:27,188 --> 00:26:28,521
Ferengi can be

507
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:30,893
very focused,
especially when no one

508
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,524
bothers to talk to them.

509
00:26:32,567 --> 00:26:34,332
I see.

510
00:26:34,371 --> 00:26:35,396
Not that I mind.

511
00:26:35,439 --> 00:26:37,375
I'm used to being ignored.

512
00:26:39,415 --> 00:26:41,112
Is something wrong, Chief?

513
00:26:41,152 --> 00:26:43,385
I can work slower
if you want me to.

514
00:26:45,528 --> 00:26:47,361
Rom...

515
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,869
I need your help

516
00:26:48,902 --> 00:26:51,135
and I need you
to keep your mouth shut.

517
00:26:51,174 --> 00:26:52,541
Can I count on you?

518
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:54,479
Is that a trick question?

519
00:26:54,515 --> 00:26:56,144
Rom, this is serious.

520
00:26:56,185 --> 00:26:58,155
You can depend on me, Chief.

521
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:00,423
We're going to make
some modifications

522
00:27:00,461 --> 00:27:02,762
to several
of the station's systems.

523
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,399
I don't want you to breathe
a word of this to anyone.

524
00:27:06,441 --> 00:27:10,108
That includes Dax, Odo
Captain Sisko, Worf...

525
00:27:10,149 --> 00:27:11,482
They don't know?

526
00:27:11,518 --> 00:27:13,317
Of course they know.

527
00:27:13,356 --> 00:27:15,691
Well, at least some of them do

528
00:27:15,729 --> 00:27:18,702
but they have to pretend
that they don't.

529
00:27:18,735 --> 00:27:21,502
This is a top secret
Starfleet operation.

530
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,032
Culpable deniability.

531
00:27:23,077 --> 00:27:24,546
I understand.

532
00:27:24,581 --> 00:27:27,520
Don't worry about me, Chief.
My lips are sealed.

533
00:27:27,554 --> 00:27:29,787
Nobody will get anything
out of me.

534
00:27:29,825 --> 00:27:31,226
Not even my name.

535
00:27:31,262 --> 00:27:34,758
Rom, everybody on the station
knows your name.

536
00:27:34,803 --> 00:27:37,570
Right.

537
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:39,911
But I won't confirm it.

538
00:27:39,948 --> 00:27:41,850
Where do we start?

539
00:28:03,533 --> 00:28:05,560
Computer, time remaining?

540
00:28:05,604 --> 00:28:09,100
Six hours, 41 minutes,
26 seconds.

541
00:28:19,835 --> 00:28:21,429
Chief...

542
00:28:21,472 --> 00:28:24,468
Commander, what are you
doing up at this hour?

543
00:28:24,512 --> 00:28:26,277
I want you to have
a look at something.

544
00:28:26,316 --> 00:28:28,787
I couldn't sleep,
so I got up and decided

545
00:28:28,822 --> 00:28:31,886
to scan the wormhole
for radiometric anomalies.

546
00:28:31,929 --> 00:28:33,626
At 3:00 in the morning?

547
00:28:33,666 --> 00:28:37,630
I've always found anomalies
to be very relaxing.

548
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:38,904
It's a curse.

549
00:28:38,944 --> 00:28:42,315
I was using the wideband
filter protocols

550
00:28:42,351 --> 00:28:45,324
and when I ran
the primary calibrations check

551
00:28:45,358 --> 00:28:47,191
I found this.

552
00:28:49,868 --> 00:28:51,998
Oh, they're slightly off spec.

553
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,377
Yes. I thought it might be
a fused matrix inverter

554
00:28:55,414 --> 00:28:57,407
until I ran
a level-3 diagnostic.

555
00:28:57,451 --> 00:28:59,148
Have a look.

556
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,886
We'd better wake the Captain.

557
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:05,163
We have a saboteur
on the station.

558
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,188
All right, what have we got?

559
00:29:15,224 --> 00:29:17,957
Computer, display diagnostic.

560
00:29:17,997 --> 00:29:20,058
Chief?

561
00:29:20,168 --> 00:29:24,234
We've identified
943 tiny fluctuations

562
00:29:24,277 --> 00:29:26,646
in the primary
communication relays

563
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,746
and several power
distribution junctions.

564
00:29:29,789 --> 00:29:31,622
Fluctuations that
can't be attributed

565
00:29:31,659 --> 00:29:34,290
to anything except
external intervention.

566
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:36,827
Someone's gained
access to our systems

567
00:29:36,872 --> 00:29:37,931
and is altering them.

568
00:29:37,974 --> 00:29:39,238
For what purpose?

569
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,803
We're working on that.

570
00:29:40,846 --> 00:29:43,842
At this point, it's hard
to even call it sabotage.

571
00:29:43,887 --> 00:29:45,914
There's been no real damage.

572
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:47,951
The systems are just
a little off spec.

573
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:50,935
So far, these alterations
don't seem

574
00:29:50,969 --> 00:29:52,495
to pose any threat
to the station.

575
00:29:52,539 --> 00:29:54,065
So far.

576
00:29:54,109 --> 00:29:55,806
But this might be just the tip

577
00:29:55,846 --> 00:29:58,785
of a very large
and dangerous iceberg.

578
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:02,625
Is there any way to trace how
this was done, and by whom?

579
00:30:02,662 --> 00:30:05,429
It has to be someone familiar
with the station's systems.

580
00:30:05,468 --> 00:30:06,994
Maybe someone who worked
on the station

581
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:08,701
under the Cardassians.

582
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:10,176
I'm running extensive
security checks

583
00:30:10,278 --> 00:30:12,180
on all recent visitors,
but so far, I haven't

584
00:30:12,216 --> 00:30:13,343
found anything.

585
00:30:13,384 --> 00:30:14,579
It could have been someone

586
00:30:14,621 --> 00:30:16,090
who's been on the station
a long time...

587
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:17,651
someone with a lot of access.

588
00:30:17,695 --> 00:30:19,460
Maybe even someone
on the maintenance crew.

589
00:30:19,499 --> 00:30:21,093
Chief?

590
00:30:22,772 --> 00:30:23,831
Yes.

591
00:30:23,875 --> 00:30:26,005
Yes, what?

592
00:30:26,046 --> 00:30:27,777
Do you think
it's someone on your staff?

593
00:30:27,817 --> 00:30:32,020
Chief O'Brien, I have
a call from your daughter.

594
00:30:32,059 --> 00:30:33,528
Go ahead.

595
00:30:41,981 --> 00:30:43,575
Molly, honey, what is it?

596
00:30:43,618 --> 00:30:46,614
Hi, Daddy. Mommy told
me I could call you.

597
00:30:46,658 --> 00:30:49,186
I hope we didn't interrupt
anything important.

598
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,494
It's all right, Molly.

599
00:30:50,533 --> 00:30:51,900
I'm glad you called.

600
00:30:51,937 --> 00:30:55,206
What are you doing at home?

601
00:30:55,244 --> 00:30:56,473
She missed her mommy.

602
00:30:56,513 --> 00:30:57,538
Isn't that sweet?

603
00:30:57,582 --> 00:30:59,245
When are you going to come?

604
00:30:59,285 --> 00:31:00,584
Ow, Mommy! That hurt.

605
00:31:00,622 --> 00:31:02,421
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.

606
00:31:02,459 --> 00:31:04,429
Are you all right, Molly?

607
00:31:04,464 --> 00:31:05,557
She's fine, Miles.

608
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,570
She just wants to know
when you'll be finished.

609
00:31:07,604 --> 00:31:09,005
I told her you had to work

610
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,241
another two hours,
22 minutes and 13 seconds.

611
00:31:12,281 --> 00:31:14,809
How long is that, Daddy?

612
00:31:14,853 --> 00:31:18,122
Soon.
I'll be home very soon.

613
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,859
Good.
We both miss you.

614
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,292
Everything all right?

615
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,091
Fine. I'm sorry
about the interruption.

616
00:31:35,131 --> 00:31:36,566
You were saying
you thought you knew

617
00:31:36,601 --> 00:31:38,161
who the saboteur might be.

618
00:31:38,204 --> 00:31:41,905
I think I have an idea.

619
00:31:53,404 --> 00:31:54,737
Hello, Constable.

620
00:31:57,513 --> 00:31:58,914
Hello, Chief.

621
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:02,219
What are you doing, Rom?

622
00:32:02,257 --> 00:32:04,592
I can't talk about it.

623
00:32:04,629 --> 00:32:06,292
Oh, yes, you can.

624
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:08,702
And you will.

625
00:32:14,885 --> 00:32:16,184
Coming, Chief?

626
00:32:16,222 --> 00:32:19,559
I'd better see what
he's been up to here.

627
00:32:19,596 --> 00:32:21,623
I'll take care of those.

628
00:32:43,404 --> 00:32:45,340
Has he said anything?

629
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:46,742
Not much.

630
00:32:46,778 --> 00:32:48,543
For the first 40 minutes,
it was

631
00:32:48,582 --> 00:32:50,780
like pulling teeth
even getting him

632
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,788
to admit his name.

633
00:32:51,822 --> 00:32:53,189
You think he's working alone?

634
00:32:53,226 --> 00:32:54,387
I don't know.

635
00:32:54,428 --> 00:32:55,555
Rom admits to nothing.

636
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:57,728
Now he's asking
to see Chief O'Brien.

637
00:32:57,768 --> 00:32:59,237
He won't talk to anybody else.

638
00:32:59,272 --> 00:33:00,935
Then get the Chief down here.

639
00:33:00,976 --> 00:33:02,775
I want to know what's going on.

640
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,285
Security to Chief O'Brien.

641
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:06,845
Go ahead, Constable.

642
00:33:06,889 --> 00:33:08,916
We need you in Security
right away.

643
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,297
I'm still trying to figure out
what Rom did to these systems.

644
00:33:12,334 --> 00:33:13,667
That'll have to wait.

645
00:33:13,704 --> 00:33:16,335
I have Captain's orders to get
you down here immediately.

646
00:33:16,377 --> 00:33:18,006
On my way.

647
00:33:18,047 --> 00:33:19,949
Computer, time remaining?

648
00:33:19,984 --> 00:33:23,048
36 minutes, nine seconds.

649
00:33:23,091 --> 00:33:26,087
Computer, locate
Maintenance Technician Rom.

650
00:33:26,131 --> 00:33:28,067
Maintenance Technician Rom

651
00:33:28,102 --> 00:33:30,471
is in Security Holding Cell
Number Four.

652
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,909
Initiate security override

653
00:33:31,944 --> 00:33:35,715
and scramble surveillance
channels 4-A, B, C and D.

654
00:33:35,752 --> 00:33:38,656
Authorization:
O'Brien-seven-one-two.

655
00:33:38,693 --> 00:33:41,096
Specified security
channels scrambled.

656
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:44,160
Now begin recalibration
of gravitic sensors

657
00:33:44,204 --> 00:33:48,202
at Access Panel 379
as indicated.

658
00:33:48,246 --> 00:33:49,772
I'll be back in ten minutes.

659
00:33:56,999 --> 00:33:58,400
The Chief is here, Rom.

660
00:33:58,435 --> 00:34:00,872
Now, what do you want to say?

661
00:34:02,144 --> 00:34:03,704
Alone.

662
00:34:03,748 --> 00:34:06,151
I'll only talk if we're alone.

663
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:17,802
What is it, Rom?

664
00:34:17,844 --> 00:34:21,545
It's okay... I've disconnected
Odo's eavesdropping devices.

665
00:34:21,586 --> 00:34:24,525
I haven't told anyone anything,
just like you said.

666
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,393
You're a good man.

667
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:28,196
Now, why did you call me?

668
00:34:28,234 --> 00:34:30,899
I told you we're under
very tight time constraints.

669
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,933
Captain Sisko is really angry.

670
00:34:32,978 --> 00:34:34,641
If I didn't know
he was pretending...

671
00:34:34,682 --> 00:34:35,650
Rom...

672
00:34:35,684 --> 00:34:36,652
Don't worry.

673
00:34:36,686 --> 00:34:39,021
I can hold out
until you say otherwise

674
00:34:39,058 --> 00:34:42,327
but there is
one thing I have to know.

675
00:34:42,365 --> 00:34:44,563
Go ahead.

676
00:34:44,604 --> 00:34:47,702
Why are we focusing
a chroniton beam

677
00:34:47,743 --> 00:34:49,042
at the wormhole?

678
00:34:50,282 --> 00:34:51,341
What?

679
00:34:51,385 --> 00:34:52,580
The new frequency

680
00:34:52,621 --> 00:34:55,058
of the deflector grid
is set to turn the station

681
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:58,828
into a massive chroniton array
aimed directly at the wormhole.

682
00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:01,670
So, I just wanted to know...

683
00:35:01,708 --> 00:35:05,672
why are we trying to kill
the wormhole aliens?

684
00:35:13,534 --> 00:35:15,026
What are you talking about?

685
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:17,803
The chroniton beam is harmless.

686
00:35:17,843 --> 00:35:21,875
To us, but its
temporal disruption

687
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:24,356
would kill a wormhole
alien instantly.

688
00:35:24,391 --> 00:35:25,883
Of course.

689
00:35:25,928 --> 00:35:28,365
Why didn't I think of that?

690
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,869
She has me so on edge

691
00:35:29,903 --> 00:35:32,466
I haven't been able to see
the forest for the trees.

692
00:35:32,509 --> 00:35:33,602
Who's she?

693
00:35:33,644 --> 00:35:36,047
I don't have time
to explain now.

694
00:35:36,083 --> 00:35:39,056
The question is:

695
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:42,291
Why would anyone want to kill
the wormhole aliens?

696
00:35:42,331 --> 00:35:45,270
Everyone has enemies,
even the Prophets.

697
00:35:45,303 --> 00:35:47,102
That's right.

698
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:50,136
They're not just
wormhole aliens, they're...

699
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:51,741
they're Prophets

700
00:35:51,784 --> 00:35:54,119
part of Bajoran mythology...

701
00:35:54,156 --> 00:35:57,652
just like the Pah-wraiths
of the Fire Caves.

702
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:00,430
So...

703
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:03,033
what have those wraiths

704
00:36:03,076 --> 00:36:05,843
got to do
with the wormhole aliens?

705
00:36:05,882 --> 00:36:07,476
<i>Koss'moran.</i>

706
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:09,318
What?

707
00:36:09,356 --> 00:36:10,723
It's a Bajoran legend.

708
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,630
From the verb <i>kosst</i>
meaning "to be"

709
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:16,730
and <i>amoran...</i> "banished."

710
00:36:16,773 --> 00:36:20,076
Leeta's been telling me
all about Bajoran legends.

711
00:36:20,113 --> 00:36:21,412
She can go on for hours.

712
00:36:21,483 --> 00:36:23,681
She says I'm a good listener.

713
00:36:23,721 --> 00:36:25,247
I'm sure you are.

714
00:36:25,291 --> 00:36:27,261
Now it's time to be
a good talker... go on.

715
00:36:27,296 --> 00:36:29,665
Well, uh, according to Leeta

716
00:36:29,701 --> 00:36:32,366
the Pah-wraiths used to live
in the wormhole.

717
00:36:32,407 --> 00:36:34,434
They were part
of the Celestial Temple.

718
00:36:34,478 --> 00:36:35,537
They were Prophets.

719
00:36:35,581 --> 00:36:36,880
False Prophets.

720
00:36:36,917 --> 00:36:38,944
They were cast out
of the Temple

721
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,457
exiled to the Caves

722
00:36:40,524 --> 00:36:42,893
where they were imprisoned
in crystal fire cages

723
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:45,163
and forbidden to ever return

724
00:36:45,202 --> 00:36:49,143
"lest they face the wrath
of the true Prophets."

725
00:36:49,177 --> 00:36:51,307
So if these false Prophets
were to return

726
00:36:51,348 --> 00:36:53,113
to the Celestial Temple...

727
00:36:53,153 --> 00:36:54,713
I don't think
they'd be welcomed.

728
00:36:54,757 --> 00:37:00,498
Unless... she kills
all the wormhole aliens first.

729
00:37:00,603 --> 00:37:04,942
Rom... I'm going to have
to leave you in a tough spot.

730
00:37:04,979 --> 00:37:07,314
Captain Sisko, Odo...

731
00:37:07,351 --> 00:37:09,447
they don't know
about any of this, do they?

732
00:37:09,488 --> 00:37:12,153
No. No, they don't

733
00:37:12,194 --> 00:37:14,061
and I want you to help me
keep it that way

734
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:15,294
for a little while longer.

735
00:37:15,334 --> 00:37:17,361
I have to stay here
and play the idiot?

736
00:37:17,406 --> 00:37:18,396
I'm afraid so.

737
00:37:18,442 --> 00:37:20,606
Now, no matter
what Odo asks you...

738
00:37:20,647 --> 00:37:22,207
I'm Quark's brother.

739
00:37:22,249 --> 00:37:23,843
I know the role.

740
00:37:26,629 --> 00:37:29,260
Computer, time remaining?

741
00:37:29,302 --> 00:37:31,705
12 minutes, 22 seconds.

742
00:37:50,348 --> 00:37:52,147
Sorry to disturb you, Chief.

743
00:37:52,185 --> 00:37:55,181
Couple of things
are still bothering me.

744
00:37:55,225 --> 00:37:57,127
Rom couldn't have

745
00:37:57,162 --> 00:37:59,029
done all this sabotage alone.

746
00:37:59,067 --> 00:38:02,632
There were too many changes
for any one person to make.

747
00:38:02,675 --> 00:38:04,201
Maybe so.

748
00:38:04,245 --> 00:38:07,241
Right now, I've got a frequency
problem in the cascade feeder.

749
00:38:07,284 --> 00:38:09,448
I checked with the repair logs.

750
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:12,657
I was hoping to match
someone's movements

751
00:38:12,697 --> 00:38:15,066
to the locations
where the alterations were made

752
00:38:15,102 --> 00:38:17,335
but I couldn't do that.

753
00:38:17,374 --> 00:38:20,141
We had a matrix systems
failure yesterday.

754
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:22,116
Those files were lost.
Sorry.

755
00:38:22,151 --> 00:38:25,818
Hmm. We've had a lot
of systems failures recently

756
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:27,020
haven't we, Chief?

757
00:38:27,062 --> 00:38:28,223
Really?
I hadn't noticed.

758
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:29,996
I've been too busy
repairing things.

759
00:38:30,035 --> 00:38:33,840
Like the surveillance channels
in the holding cells?

760
00:38:33,943 --> 00:38:35,810
You authorized
a security override.

761
00:38:35,848 --> 00:38:37,215
What was wrong with them?

762
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:40,120
The fiber optic relay
was out of sync.

763
00:38:40,157 --> 00:38:41,854
The isolinear chip
junction was...

764
00:38:41,928 --> 00:38:43,557
Enough, Chief.

765
00:38:43,598 --> 00:38:45,865
You didn't cover your tracks
very well.

766
00:38:45,903 --> 00:38:46,962
Why?

767
00:38:48,476 --> 00:38:50,378
I didn't have time.

768
00:38:50,413 --> 00:38:53,146
I still don't.

769
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:57,223
Sorry, Odo.

770
00:39:00,903 --> 00:39:02,999
Chief O'Brien to Keiko O'Brien.

771
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,235
This is Keiko.

772
00:39:04,277 --> 00:39:06,304
I've finished,
but we have to move quickly.

773
00:39:06,348 --> 00:39:08,751
This place is going to be
swarming with Security.

774
00:39:08,787 --> 00:39:11,486
Meet me
at Runabout Pad C now.

775
00:39:11,526 --> 00:39:13,519
How did you know
I'd want a runabout?

776
00:39:13,564 --> 00:39:15,124
Because I know
what you're planning to do

777
00:39:15,168 --> 00:39:16,660
but don't worry,
I don't give a damn

778
00:39:16,704 --> 00:39:19,039
about the Celestial Temple
or your non-corporeal feuds.

779
00:39:19,075 --> 00:39:20,738
I just want my wife back.

780
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:24,379
Now, you still need me to
pilot you to the wormhole.

781
00:39:24,421 --> 00:39:26,357
So let's stop wasting time.

782
00:39:26,392 --> 00:39:27,656
Agreed?

783
00:39:27,695 --> 00:39:28,924
I'll meet you there.

784
00:39:42,928 --> 00:39:44,295
That's correct, Commander.

785
00:39:44,332 --> 00:39:46,325
I want to test
some new magnetic constrictors

786
00:39:46,369 --> 00:39:48,499
in the runabout's impulse
thrusters.

787
00:39:48,541 --> 00:39:50,204
Very well, Chief.

788
00:39:50,245 --> 00:39:52,773
You're cleared for departure,
but before you go

789
00:39:52,817 --> 00:39:54,753
there's one thing
I'd like to ask you.

790
00:39:54,787 --> 00:39:56,620
What's that?

791
00:39:56,659 --> 00:39:59,826
Did you enjoy your birthday?

792
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:03,966
Well, it was full of surprises.

793
00:40:04,008 --> 00:40:07,915
Good.
Those are always my favorites.

794
00:40:15,935 --> 00:40:18,338
Hold position here.

795
00:40:18,373 --> 00:40:21,778
Computer, initiate modifications
O'Brien-731

796
00:40:21,814 --> 00:40:24,513
and enable remote com link.

797
00:40:24,553 --> 00:40:26,683
Com link enabled.

798
00:40:32,738 --> 00:40:34,071
What the hell?

799
00:40:37,181 --> 00:40:39,584
Target the center
of the wormhole.

800
00:40:39,619 --> 00:40:41,988
Target coordinates set.

801
00:40:42,025 --> 00:40:43,790
Have us face the Temple.

802
00:40:43,829 --> 00:40:45,890
The blast will last
only a fraction of a second.

803
00:40:45,934 --> 00:40:47,870
They'll all be dead
before they even see it.

804
00:40:52,615 --> 00:40:55,018
Oh! You have no idea

805
00:40:55,054 --> 00:40:56,887
how many centuries
I've waited for this.

806
00:40:56,924 --> 00:40:59,054
Let's get on with it!

807
00:40:59,095 --> 00:41:00,860
Miles, you have a lot to learn
about patience.

808
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,927
Proceed.

809
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,543
Chief, what's going on
out there?

810
00:41:06,578 --> 00:41:08,776
I'm ordering you to return
to the station.

811
00:41:08,817 --> 00:41:10,286
Now.

812
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,051
Activate.

813
00:41:35,509 --> 00:41:36,636
Keiko?

814
00:41:40,386 --> 00:41:42,219
Keiko?

815
00:41:42,257 --> 00:41:44,785
Miles...

816
00:42:00,062 --> 00:42:02,158
Chief...

817
00:42:02,201 --> 00:42:04,604
you have some explaining to do.

818
00:42:10,051 --> 00:42:12,215
It was more like having
something

819
00:42:12,256 --> 00:42:14,750
coiled around inside my head.

820
00:42:14,795 --> 00:42:17,289
I could see and hear
through it

821
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:20,865
but anytime I tried
to do anything...

822
00:42:20,908 --> 00:42:26,045
it was like being stuck
in sand and squeezed.

823
00:42:26,087 --> 00:42:27,579
Yeah.

824
00:42:27,623 --> 00:42:29,525
Could you sense
any of its thoughts?

825
00:42:29,561 --> 00:42:31,862
Just feelings, sometimes.

826
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:34,839
Kind of a cold rage.

827
00:42:34,872 --> 00:42:37,173
I don't think it had
any intention

828
00:42:37,211 --> 00:42:39,614
of leaving either one of us
alive.

829
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:42,383
You don't have to talk about
it if you don't want to.

830
00:42:42,422 --> 00:42:44,119
Oh, it feels better
to talk about it.

831
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:48,898
Besides, I don't want to forget
how hard you fought for me.

832
00:43:07,411 --> 00:43:09,541
Hello, Brother.

833
00:43:09,582 --> 00:43:11,883
You look horrible.

834
00:43:11,921 --> 00:43:14,791
I'm telling you, Rom

835
00:43:14,827 --> 00:43:16,160
working the night shift

836
00:43:16,197 --> 00:43:17,632
is driving you
to an early grave.

837
00:43:17,666 --> 00:43:18,999
I wasn't working.

838
00:43:19,036 --> 00:43:20,903
What do you mean
you weren't working?

839
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,534
I'm not on
the night shift anymore.

840
00:43:22,577 --> 00:43:25,675
I knew it.
O'Brien fired you.

841
00:43:25,718 --> 00:43:26,777
No, Brother.

842
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:28,221
In appreciation of my work

843
00:43:28,256 --> 00:43:32,061
the Chief... has promoted me

844
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:34,195
to the day shift.

845
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:36,639
He says I have a promising
future in engineering.

846
00:43:36,675 --> 00:43:38,144
Then why do you look so tired?

847
00:43:38,178 --> 00:43:39,477
I was out celebrating.

848
00:43:39,515 --> 00:43:40,608
With who?

849
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:42,244
My crewmates.

850
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:43,916
I think they like me.

851
00:43:43,958 --> 00:43:45,757
Do they?

852
00:43:45,795 --> 00:43:46,922
Especially Litana.

853
00:43:46,965 --> 00:43:49,995
She's always finding excuses
to talk to me.

854
00:43:50,037 --> 00:43:53,272
Well, Rom...

855
00:43:53,378 --> 00:43:56,476
I'm glad things are going
so well for you.

856
00:43:56,519 --> 00:43:57,818
No, you're not

857
00:43:57,855 --> 00:44:00,953
but thanks anyway, Brother.

858
00:44:00,995 --> 00:44:04,435
I guess you'll be wanting
the "Chief's Special" again?

859
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:05,871
Actually, no.

860
00:44:05,906 --> 00:44:09,107
I've discovered that bacon
doesn't agree with me.

861
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,171
What a surprise.

862
00:44:10,215 --> 00:44:11,444
Instead

863
00:44:11,485 --> 00:44:14,925
I'll have
a short stack of pancakes

864
00:44:14,959 --> 00:44:18,364
dripping with butter,
a side of sausage

865
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,201
and... pineapple.

866
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,573
Pineapple?

867
00:44:22,609 --> 00:44:26,014
That's the breakfast
of choice on the day shift.

868
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:28,613
Pineapple.
