1
00:00:00,918 --> 00:00:02,085
You know, Morn,

2
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:04,087
there's nothing
more invigorating

3
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:05,213
than breakfast in a bar.

4
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:07,758
Where else can you
get raw slug liver

5
00:00:07,758 --> 00:00:09,134
first thing
in the morning?

6
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:12,387
Mmm, mmm.

7
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:21,647
What's this?

8
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:23,357
What do you mean,
"what's this?"

9
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:24,859
It's puree of beetle.

10
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:26,527
I didn't order it.

11
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:27,862
Of course you didn't order it.

12
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:29,196
You don't need to order it.

13
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,949
You have it after work
every morning.

14
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:35,703
Well, I'm not having it
<i>this</i> morning.

15
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:37,830
I'd like...

16
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:41,375
two eggs over easy,
three strips of bacon,

17
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,793
and a side of corned beef hash.

18
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,337
What kind of breakfast is that?

19
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:48,465
It's Chief O'Brien's
breakfast of choice.

20
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:53,595
That's the problem
with working alongside hu-mans--

21
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:56,431
you pick up
their disgusting habits.

22
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,432
Bacon...

23
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:00,143
corned beef hash.

24
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,479
What's next, Rom?

25
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,899
Orange juice and coffee?

26
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:06,107
That might be nice.

27
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:08,235
(<i> sighing</i> )

28
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,404
I don't understand.

29
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:14,241
You gave up
a perfectly good job with me

30
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:17,828
to work on the station's
waste extraction system?

31
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:20,163
A good waste extraction system
is important.

32
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,041
Imagine where we'd be
without one.

33
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:24,209
Of course it's important,
but my point is

34
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:27,128
you're not getting
the choice assignments.

35
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:31,090
O'Brien's got you
on the night shift

36
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,386
doing all the work
nobody else wants to do.

37
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:36,055
I like my work.

38
00:01:36,055 --> 00:01:39,391
You like standing
all night long,

39
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:41,518
knee-deep in waste,

40
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:44,063
fixing some broken
flow regulator

41
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:46,105
when you
could be here,

42
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:51,779
staring at half-naked
dabo girls?

43
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:58,285
I have a good job.

44
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,412
I'm proud of the work I do,

45
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:03,040
and I know that one day,

46
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,043
Chief O'Brien will recognize
my efforts

47
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:08,670
and reward me
with a position of respect

48
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,798
and responsibility,
and<i> why?</i>

49
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:13,717
Because that's just
the way things are

50
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:14,885
in Engineering.

51
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:15,970
(<i> plate clatters</i> )

52
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,640
I'm sorry I brought it up.

53
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:29,566
They don't look
so fine now.

54
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,985
I can't understand it.

55
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:32,903
I followed Keiko's instructions
to the letter.

56
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:34,071
They were dry as a bone

57
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,196
when I came by
for you yesterday.

58
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:36,531
I mean, I gave
them water.

59
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,783
I just don't think
it was enough.

60
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:39,701
You watered them?

61
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,996
These are Idran hybrids.

62
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:43,872
Too much water
rots their roots.

63
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:44,873
Oh.

64
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,125
(<i> door opening</i> )

65
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,795
Mommy's going to be mad.

66
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,090
I can't believe it.

67
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,717
Keiko's gone five days,
and we kill her plants.

68
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,344
She'll understand,
won't she?

69
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,054
I mean, after all,
they're just plants.

70
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,722
They're not just plants.

71
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,684
These are her bonsai trees.

72
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,727
She's cared for them,
and nurtured them

73
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:09,272
and carefully sculpted
their growth for months...

74
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,189
years.

75
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,733
You're in trouble.

76
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,989
Listen, Molly,
I think you and I

77
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:19,074
should both go
to the airlock

78
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:20,617
and welcome Mommy back,

79
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,995
and then after we've
hugged and kissed and...

80
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:25,164
you can tell her
what happened.

81
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:26,748
Not me.

82
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,293
Well, don't look at me.

83
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,211
Well,<i> you</i> killed
her plants.

84
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,755
<i>We</i> killed them.

85
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,757
But I think you're overreacting
to the situation.

86
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,092
I mean, Keiko
will forgive you.

87
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:38,719
It's your birthday today,
isn't it?

88
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,637
Yeah, so far, it's one
I'd like to forget.

89
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,806
Well, she's been
away on Bajor.

90
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:45,142
She's missed you.

91
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,351
Bring her a gift.

92
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,478
What kind of chocolates
does she like?

93
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,022
Tellurian mint truffles,

94
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:52,191
but I still think
you should be with me.

95
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:53,692
You don't need me there.

96
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:56,486
I've seen you handle your wife
thousands of times.

97
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,779
Just say you're sorry

98
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,740
and that you take
full responsibility.

99
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,950
You'll be fine.

100
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,953
Besides, I, uh...
have to be in surgery...

101
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:05,913
operating.

102
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,206
On who?

103
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:08,540
I'll find someone.

104
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,304
It was Julian.

105
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,057
He was trying
to be helpful.

106
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:26,349
He over-watered them.

107
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,018
It's not his fault.

108
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,686
You know how he is.

109
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,980
Sometimes he doesn't even
know what he's doing.

110
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,192
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

111
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,027
We'll buy some new ones.

112
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,654
Forget it, Miles.
They're just plants.

113
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,073
Exactly.

114
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:42,407
It's not as if

115
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,618
something happened
to Molly or the baby.

116
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,994
Right, right.

117
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:49,330
I mean, everybody's fine.
No problems.

118
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,373
Good.

119
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,499
What about Kira?

120
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:52,626
Is she back yet?

121
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,669
No, she's still
with Shakaar.

122
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,005
They're traveling around
Dahkur Province.

123
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,339
I thought you were
going to visit them.

124
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,925
I didn't get a chance.

125
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,177
So, how are
the Fire Caves?

126
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:03,595
Fine.

127
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:08,267
And now it's time for me
to tell you some news.

128
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:10,435
I'm not Keiko.

129
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,564
No?

130
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,276
Who are you?

131
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,320
Listen carefully, Miles.

132
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,907
I have taken possession
of your wife's body.

133
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,826
I will hold it hostage

134
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,578
until you do everything
I tell you to

135
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,705
accurately,
and without question.

136
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,750
Hmm... everything?

137
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,460
If you don't do
precisely what I ask,

138
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,795
I'll kill your wife.

139
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:39,589
Are you all right?

140
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,801
Maybe there's
been an outbreak

141
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,719
of Rudellian brain
fever on Bajor.

142
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,305
We should go see Julian--

143
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:47,889
I see I'm going
to have to give you

144
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,308
a demonstration
of my sincerity.

145
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,227
(<i> groaning and choking</i> )

146
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,228

(<i> choking</i> )

148
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:58,817
Keiko!

149
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,737
No.

150
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:04,656
No, Miles.

151
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:05,949
You're not telling anyone.

152
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,951
If you do, I'll stop
her heart forever.

153
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,449
If you're really in
control my wife's body,

154
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,575
let me speak to her.

155
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,453
She can hear whatever
you have to say.

156
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:15,454
Not good enough.

157
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:17,205
I want to talk to her.

158
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,333
I want her
to talk to me.

159
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,377
You're in no position
to bargain, Miles.

160
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,964
Strange, these corporeal
bodies of yours-- so fragile.

161
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,883
Burst even a tiny blood vessel
in the brain,

162
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,302
and every memory,

163
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:34,055
every passionate emotion--
gone forever.

164
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:37,725
You really shouldn't let me
eat all these by myself, Miles.

165
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,269
I'm not hungry.

166
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,561
Look, why don't
you just tell me

167
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,646
what it is you
want me to do

168
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,814
so we can get
this over with.

169
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,107
Very well.

170
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,817
But let me make
one thing clear:

171
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:48,945
I will not do anything
to jeopardize this station

172
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,155
or the people on it.

173
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,448
Don't worry, Miles.

174
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,408
All I want you to
do is reconfigure

175
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:54,909
some of the
communication

176
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,577
and sensor relays
on the station.

177
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:57,662
Why?

178
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,747
I can't tell you.

179
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,253
You'll have to be patient.

180
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,172
The communications
and sensor relays

181
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,341
are distributed throughout
the entire station.

182
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,221
You know your wife
well, Miles,

183
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,555
but she knows
you even better.

184
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,098
I know you're just
playing for time

185
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,599
until you can get
to your friends--

186
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:21,936
Julian, Dax,
Captain Sisko.

187
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,646
I know they'll all
want to help you.

188
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:24,814
The Captain may
even allow you

189
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,024
to do what I'm asking,

190
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,734
at least until
someone figures out

191
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:30,820
a way to catch me
in some sort of stasis field

192
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,990
or some other clever device
you're already dreaming up.

193
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,328
And you know what?
It might work.

194
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,621
You might be able to stop me,

195
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,957
but I promise you one thing:

196
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,792
If you do, Keiko will die.

197
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,878
All I need

198
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,213
is a split second

199
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,673
to cause a massive
brain hemorrhage, and...

200
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,426
she's gone.

201
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,765
I know this is a difficult
adjustment for you to make,

202
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,600
but we don't have a lot of time.

203
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,229
What do you want me to do?

204
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:06,814
KEIKO:
How long is this
going to take?

205
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:09,484
In order to keep
the polarity shift

206
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:10,985
invisible to
security checks,

207
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,071
I'm going to
have to tap into

208
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,615
the optronic integrator
on Level Five.

209
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,783
You're the engineer.

210
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,414
What is it, Miles?

211
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:24,583
What do you want
to ask me?

212
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,460
You always tighten
your brow just a tiny bit

213
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,628
whenever you're about
to ask a question.

214
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,922
It's something
only a wife would notice.

215
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:32,466
Why Keiko?

216
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,468
Why take control of her?
Why not me?

217
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,261
I'm the one who can do the work.

218
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:37,845
It would be more efficient.

219
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:38,930
(<i> door chimes</i> )

220
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:42,892
Come in.

221
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,896
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

222
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,565
Yes, you are.
We're busy.

223
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,775
Miles, don't be so rude.

224
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,778
Aw, Bajoran spiny basil--
how thoughtful.

225
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,906
It's the least
I could do after...

226
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,493
Oh, it's all
right, Julian.

227
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:00,868
I forgive you.

228
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,579
Now, you are coming
to the party tonight,

229
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:03,538
aren't you?

230
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:04,831
BASHIR:
I'll be here.

231
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,749
I guess it's not
a surprise anymore.

232
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,043
Oh, I can't believe
I did that.

233
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,379
I arranged a birthday
dinner for you tonight,

234
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,923
but I wanted it
to be a surprise.

235
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,842
Well, that's okay.

236
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,470
I... I don't like surprises.

237
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,929
Well, I better be going.

238
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,182
I left a patient
on the operating table.

239
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,766
I'll see you later.

240
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,310
Thanks, Julian.

241
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,727
This was so sweet.

242
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:27,770
No problem.

243
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,819
A party? Tonight?

244
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,154
It is your birthday.

245
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:37,864
We can't have
all those people here.

246
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:38,906
We'll have to cancel.

247
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,783
And raise suspicions?

248
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,785
It's better if the dinner
goes on as planned.

249
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,204
Besides, Keiko

250
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,747
went to a lot of trouble
to arrange it for you.

251
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:49,042
Now, you better
get back to work.

252
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,628
You don't want to be late
for your shift briefing,

253
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,921
and I've got a lot
of cooking to do.

254
00:11:57,676 --> 00:11:58,759
(<i> sighing</i> )

255
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:13,858
Diagnostic and Repair Technician
Junior Grade Rom reporting.

256
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,611
Right. You're Duarte's
replacement. Have a seat.

257
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:19,322
I'm on the swing shift?

258
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:20,699
For a day or two.

259
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:23,117
WOMAN:
What's the matter
with Duarte?

260
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,203
MALE:
Sick as a vole.

261
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:30,709
Is this where Duarte sits?

262
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,546
So, what are you drinking?

263
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:35,880
<i>Raktajino.</i>

264
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,257
Great.

265
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:41,177
Is that what we drink
on the swing shift?

266
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,346
You can drink
anything you want.

267
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:46,224
I'll have a<i> raktajino.</i>

268
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,937
It's not like this
on the night shift.

269
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,231
We don't drink<i> raktajino.</i>

270
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,775
We really don't drink anything.

271
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:58,278
Fascinating.

272
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,238
Change of plans today, people.

273
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:03,491
I need to recalibrate
the optronic integrator

274
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,034
on Level Five.

275
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,911
What is it, Rom?

276
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,329
I volunteer.

277
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,457
I like phase-shifting
reconfigurations.

278
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,292
Thank you, but I'll
take care of that myself.

279
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,752
I want the rest of you

280
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:16,170
to concentrate
on the new inertial couplings.

281
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,173
I want all 64 couplings
done today.

282
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:23,511
Watley, you and Tekoa
cover the docking ring.

283
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,764
Abdon and Nori, the cargo bays.

284
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:27,848
Rom, the upper pylons.

285
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:28,849
Any questions?

286
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,226
Good.

287
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,894
Now, since I'll be
working alone today,

288
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,938
I'm going to be very busy,
so I don't want

289
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,898
to be interrupted
by anything unimportant.

290
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,024
Is that clear?

291
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,401
Yes, sir.

292
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:53,832
Computer...
locate Keiko O'Brien.

293
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:58,087
COMPUTER: Keiko O'Brien
is in her quarters.

294
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:03,092
Computer, initiate full
identity scan of Keiko O'Brien

295
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:06,596
and note any inconsistencies
with existing medical records.

296
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,434
COMPUTER: Scan complete.
No inconsistencies found.

297
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,270
Identity confirmed.

298
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,025
How long would it take
a level-3 stasis field

299
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,820
to render Keiko O'Brien
unconscious?

300
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,365
COMPUTER: All cognitive reflexes
would cease in 2.1 seconds.

301
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,949
Too long.

302
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:32,205
Calculate the time
if anesthetine gas were used.

303
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:35,458
COMPUTER:
1.4 seconds.

304
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,585
What about a phaser set on stun?

305
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,962
COMPUTER: 0.9 seconds.

306
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,886
God help me.

JAKE:
There you
are, Chief.

308
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,165
I was beginning to think

309
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,250
you were going to miss
your own party.

00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,585
I'm sorry I'm late.

311
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:19,919
I had a few odds
and ends to tie up.

00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,879
Have you seen Keiko?

313
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,088
Oh, she's in the bedroom

314
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,297
helping Molly try on
different shoes--

315
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,716
a little fashion crisis.

316
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:26,384
But as usual, your wife
has handled everything.

317
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:27,802
You're a lucky man, Miles.

318
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:30,805
Keiko has really
outdone herself this time.

00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,265
Take it from an old cook--

320
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:35,101

KEIKO:
Single malt Irish whiskey.
Neat.

Molly wanted to wear
her new purple shoes for you.

Doesn't she look pretty?

334
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,514
Very pretty.

335
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,266
Now all the food's set out
on the table,

336
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:18,519
so just relax with your friends
and I'll pass these around.

Sorry I'm late.

00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,574
Dax, I was afraid
you weren't coming.

342
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,409
Well, I heard you
were serving Q'parol,

343
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,744
and how could
I miss it?

344
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,251
What's the matter, Chief?

345
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,377
You look a little
preoccupied.

346
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,378
Everything all right?

347
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,673
Well, there's, um...

348
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,883
there's something
I forgot to tell Keiko.

349
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:50,217
Would you excuse me
for a moment?

350
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,511
Of course.

351
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:56,850
Did you see
any Pah-wraiths?

352

Odo was telling me
the Caves

355
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,437
were haunted by some

00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,189
sort of weird
supernatural beings.

357
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,441
Don't tell me you believe
in wraiths.

have mentioned

00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,237
about creatures living
in the caves,

361
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,657
but I never said
I believe in them.

362
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,492
Well, the only thing
I saw in the caves

363
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:17,453
were some beautiful and
botanically fascinating fungi.

364
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,538
JAKE:
Well,

365
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:19,998
maybe the next time

366
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:21,457
you go to the Fire Caves,
I could come along.

367
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,793
I've always wanted
to meet a Pah-wraith.

368
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:26,045
Maybe you will.
You never know.

369
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,171
I've done what you asked.

370
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,506
That's terrific, Miles.

371
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:29,757
We'll talk later.

372
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,094
MOLLY:
Can I have cake now?

373
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,763
KEIKO:
Oh, in a bit, sweetie.

374
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:38,975
(<i> groans</i> )

375
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,978
Miles, are you
bleeding?

376
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,980
No. It's...
it's nothing.

377
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,231
Let me take a look.

378
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,566
I said I'm all right!

379
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,238
I'm sorry.

380
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,574
I'm sorry, everybody.

381
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,492
Excuse me.

382
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,171
Get ahold of yourself.

383
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,510
Look, I've done
everything

384
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,929
you've asked me to do.

385
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,680
Just give me back my wife.

386
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,390
You've done well, Miles,

387
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:23,102
but recalibrating the optronic
integrator was only a test.

388
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,521
I had to be sure
I could trust you.

389
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,315
Tomorrow the real work begins.

390
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:31,527
Now it's time to get back
to our guests.

391
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,696
We don't want
to raise suspicions, do we?

392
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,842
Is Molly asleep?

393
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,260
Yes.

394
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,512
The Q'parol was a huge success.

395
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:04,184
Look, no more tests,
no more games.

396
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,145
Just tell me
what you want done.

397
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,188
We'll talk about it
in the morning.

398
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,857
It's late and
you're working

399
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,609
a double shift
tomorrow.

400
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,193
I want to talk about it now!

401
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:16,405
Miles, I make the rules.

402
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,158
Now relax.

403
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,829
Everything's going to be fine
as long as you do what I ask.

404
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,000
I'll sleep on the couch.

405
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,335
Don't be childish.

406
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,920
What if Molly has one
of her nightmares

407
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,630
and comes running in?

408
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:40,096
You'll sleep in bed with me
just like you always do.

409
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,223
I'll be there
in a minute.

410
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,517
Don't be too late.

411
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,602
You've got a busy day tomorrow.

412
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:56,529
Computer...

413
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:00,867
give me the record
of all Bajoran legends

414
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:03,452
concerning the Pah-wraiths.

415
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:07,540
COMPUTER: There are 6,427
entries in the data banks

416
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,416
that reference that subject.

417
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,251
Please specify.

418
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,755
KEIKO:
Miles?

419
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:30,104
Sleep well.

420
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,109
(<i> sighs</i> )

421
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,348
Another weakness
of you corporeal life-forms--

422
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,185
your need for physical intimacy.

423
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:11,729
It's especially irritating
in your young.

424
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:14,190
I have to get Molly
ready for school.

425
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,859
I'll do it.
You have a big day ahead of you.

426
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,945
Molly is going to sleep over
at the Davis' tonight,

427
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:21,197
and she's staying there
until this is over.

428
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,032
You really think that's wise?

429
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,742
A little girl needs her mother.

430
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:26,535
Molly would be lost
without hers.

431
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,162
You stay away from her.

432
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:31,373
Miles, I'd never do anything
to hurt your daughter...

433
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,584
unless you force me to.

434
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,880
These are your instructions.

435
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,632
Follow them precisely.

436
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:51,144
Computer, locate Captain Sisko.

437
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:53,896
Captain Sisko is in Security.

438
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:12,999
Miles?

439
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,502
No!

440
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:28,097
ODO:
And you didn't see anyone

441
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,723
near her before she fell?

442
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:33,936
Nobody, but I was passing
underneath the walkway,

443
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:35,813
and I had my back toward her.

444
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:37,148
What were you doing
on the Promenade?

445
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:38,316
What?

446
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:39,608
Weren't you supposed
to be working

447
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,902
on optronic circuitry
on Level Five?

448
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:44,947
I was going to the Replimat
for lunch.

449
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,657
BASHIR:
Keiko is going
to be all right.

450
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:48,659
She's lucky that she landed
the way that she did.

451
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,203
It distributed the impact.

452
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:51,829
Otherwise, a fall
from that height

453
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:53,080
could easily have killed her

454
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,165
or left her paralyzed.

455
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:55,333
Is she conscious?

456
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,626
Yes, but she's
still in shock.

457
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:58,961
She has a broken femur
and a hairline fracture

458
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:00,587
of the right
parietal lobe.

459
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:01,714
Can I see her?

460
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:03,966
Maybe in a couple of hours.

461
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,259
Right now, she
needs to rest.

462
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:06,927
Julian...

463
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,679
I really need
to see her now.

464
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:10,056
Doctor.

465
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,642
All right...

466
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,519
but only for
a few minutes.

467
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,730
Don't excite her.

468
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:32,410
Keiko?

469
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,623
You were going
to tell them about me.

470
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,334
How did you know?

471
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:41,003
I know everything
your wife knows,

472
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:42,588
and she knows you.

473
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:45,299
I told you we have
to trust one another.

474
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,093
You violated that trust.

475
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:48,928
Now look where it's led us.

476
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:51,889
I want my wife back,
do you hear? I want her...

477
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:53,515
Then stop trying
to fool me.

478
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:56,269
How much more damage do you
think this body can take?

479
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:58,938
Now...

480
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,647
no more tricks.

481
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:01,982
Agreed?

482
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:07,071
Say it.

483
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,032
Agreed.

484
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:11,367
Good.

485
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:12,910
You know what you need to do.

486
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,412
You should get back to work.

487
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:17,081
I'll have everything completed
in 36 hours.

488
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:19,666
You have 13 and not
a minute more.

489
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,459
I can't do it that fast.

490
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:23,754
You're a very
resourceful man.

491
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:25,965
I'm sure you can
find a way...

492
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,050
for Keiko's sake.

493
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,010
You bloody...

494
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,721
She does need to rest, Chief.

495
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,598
Tell Molly I'll
be home soon.

496
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,516
Tell her
Mommy's fine.

497
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:39,228
Don't scare her.

498
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:40,854
Miles...

499
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,940
give me a kiss.

500
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:56,536
I'm counting on you.

501
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:01,459
She'll be back on her feet soon,
I promise.

502
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,922
Computer, begin a 13-hour
countdown, starting now.

503
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,506
COMPUTER:
Clock activated.

504
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:09,842
Chief.

505
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,636
I heard about
Keiko's accident.

506
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:13,804
How is she?

507
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:15,681
Julian said
she'll be home soon.

508
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:16,849
That is good.

509
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,934
If there is anything
I can do...

510
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,020
I wish there was.

511
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,314
I really do.

512
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:25,024
I'd better get going.

513
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,151
I'm falling behind schedule.

514
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:35,784
Computer, time remaining?

515
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:39,079
Eight hours, 22 minutes,
three seconds.

516
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:49,631
Chief!

517
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:50,590
(<i> gasps</i> )

518
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,758
Sorry.

519
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:53,427
I didn't mean
to startle you.

520
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:54,928
Rom, what are you
doing here?

521
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,306
Reporting for my
next assignment.

522
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:59,475
I've completed
calibration tests

523
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:00,851
on the inertial
coupling ports

524
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:02,644
on all three
upper pylons.

525
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:03,729
Already?

526
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,535
How did you finish
so quickly?

527
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:19,495
I just did the work.

528
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:22,039
I didn't allow myself
to get caught up

529
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:23,916
in any of the
distracting discussions

530
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:26,126
the other workers
engage in.

531
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,503
Ferengi can be

532
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:29,922
very focused,
especially when no one

533
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,507
bothers to talk to them.

534
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:33,342
I see.

535
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:34,385
Not that I mind.

536
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:36,387
I'm used to being ignored.

537
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:40,099
Is something wrong, Chief?

538
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:42,393
I can work slower
if you want me to.

539
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:46,313
Rom...

540
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,773
I need your help,

541
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:50,109
and I need you to
keep your mouth shut.

542
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,485
Can I count on you?

543
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:53,446
Is that
a trick question?

544
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:55,114
Rom, this is serious.

545
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:56,990
You can depend
on me, Chief.

546
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,243
We're going to make
some modifications

547
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:01,537
to several
of the station's systems.

548
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:05,374
I don't want you to breathe
a word of this to anyone.

549
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:07,625
That includes Dax, Odo,

550
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,044
Captain Sisko,
Worf...

551
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,421
They don't know?

552
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:12,298
Of course they know.

553
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:14,592
Well, at least some of them do,

554
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:17,553
but they have to pretend
that they don't.

555
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:20,431
This is a top secret
Starfleet operation.

556
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:21,765
Culpable deniability.

557
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,350
I understand.

558
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:26,395
Don't worry about me, Chief.
My lips are sealed.

559
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:28,688
Nobody will get anything
out of me.

560
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:30,149
Not even my name.

561
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:33,693
Rom, everybody on the station
knows your name.

562
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:36,489
Right.

563
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:38,824
But I won't confirm it.

564
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:40,784
Where do we start?

565
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,350
Computer, time remaining?

566
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:08,020
Six hours, 41 minutes,
26 seconds.

567
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:20,240
DAX:
Chief...

568
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,243
Commander, what are you
doing up at this hour?

569
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,078
I want you to have
a look at something.

570
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,540
I couldn't sleep,
so I got up and decided

571
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,792
to scan the wormhole
for radiometric anomalies.

572
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,419
At 3:00 in the morning?

573
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:36,465
I've always found anomalies
to be<i> very</i> relaxing.

574
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:37,757
It's a curse.

575
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:41,053
I was using the wideband
filter protocols,

576
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:44,139
and when I ran
the primary calibrations check,

577
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,058
I found this.

578
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:50,812
Oh, they're
slightly off spec.

579
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:54,191
Yes. I thought it might be
a fused matrix inverter

580
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:56,235
until I ran
a level-3 diagnostic.

581
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:58,028
Have a look.

582
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:01,615
We'd better wake
the Captain.

583
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:04,034
We have a saboteur
on the station.

584
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:13,627
All right, what have we got?

585
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:16,463
Computer, display diagnostic.

586
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,549
Chief?

587
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:22,678
We've identified
943 tiny fluctuations

588
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:25,097
in the primary
communication relays

589
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:28,058
and several power
distribution junctions.

590
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:29,976
Fluctuations that
can't be attributed

591
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:32,605
to anything except
external intervention.

592
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:35,315
Someone's gained
access to our systems

593
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:36,358
and is altering them.

594
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:37,568
For what purpose?

595
00:29:37,568 --> 00:29:39,486
We're working on that.

596
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:42,239
At this point, it's hard
to even call it sabotage.

597
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:44,700
There's been no real damage.

598
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,702
The systems are just
a little off spec.

599
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:49,705
So far, these alterations
don't seem

600
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:51,290
to pose any threat
to the station.

601
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,791
So far.

602
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,543
But this might
be just the tip

603
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:57,463
of a very large
and dangerous iceberg.

604
00:29:57,463 --> 00:30:01,341
Is there any way to trace how
this was done, and by whom?

605
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:04,177
It has to be someone familiar
with the station's systems.

606
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:05,763
Maybe someone who worked
on the station

607
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:07,431
under the Cardassians.

608
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:08,974
I'm running extensive
security checks

609
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,892
on all recent visitors,
but so far, I haven't

610
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,018
found anything.

611
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,520
DAX:
It could have been someone

612
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,813
who's been on the station
a long time--

613
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,356
someone with
a lot of access.

614
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,150
Maybe even someone
on the maintenance crew.

615
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,901
Chief?

616
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,571
Yes.

617
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:24,531
Yes, what?

618
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,450
Do you think
it's someone
on your staff?

619
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,118
(<i> beeping</i> )

620
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:30,746
MAN: Chief O'Brien, I have
a call from your daughter.

621
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:32,331
Go ahead.

622
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:42,215
Molly, honey, what is it?

623
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:45,302
Hi, Daddy. Mommy told
me I could call you.

624
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:47,805
I hope we didn't interrupt
anything important.

625
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:49,181
It's all right, Molly.

626
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:50,599
I'm glad you called.

627
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:53,977
What are you doing at home?

628
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,061
She missed her mommy.

629
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,188
Isn't that sweet?

630
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:57,939
When are you
going to come...?

631
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,274
Ow, Mommy! That hurt.

632
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,109
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.

633
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,069
Are you all right, Molly?

634
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,530
She's fine, Miles.

635
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,114
She just wants to know
when you'll be finished.

636
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,574
I told her
you had to work

637
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:10,869
another two hours,
22 minutes and 13 seconds.

638
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,372
MOLLY:
How long is that, Daddy?

639
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:16,750
Soon.
I'll be home very soon.

640
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,545
Good.
We both miss you.

641
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,807
Everything all right?

642
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,726
Fine. I'm sorry about
the interruption.

643
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:35,185
You were saying
you thought you knew

644
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:36,812
who the saboteur
might be.

645
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:40,566
I think I have an idea.

646
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:53,370
Hello, Constable.

647
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,541
Hello, Chief.

648
00:31:57,541 --> 00:32:00,753
What are you doing, Rom?

649
00:32:00,753 --> 00:32:03,213
I can't talk about it.

650
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:04,923
Oh, yes, you can.

651
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,342
And you will.

652
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,600
Coming, Chief?

653
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,144
I'd better see what
he's been up to here.

654
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:20,230
I'll take care of those.

655
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,995
(<i> sighs in frustration</i> )

656
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:44,087
Has he said anything?

657
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,464
Not much.

658
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,173
For the first
40 minutes, it was

659
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:49,509
like pulling teeth
even getting him

660
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:50,636
to admit his name.

661
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:51,887
You think he's
working alone?

662
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:52,930
I don't know.

663
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:54,180
Rom admits to nothing.

664
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,391
Now he's asking
to see Chief O'Brien.

665
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,851
He won't talk
to anybody else.

666
00:32:57,851 --> 00:32:59,603
Then get the Chief
down here.

667
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:01,438
I want to know
what's going on.

668
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:03,899
Security to Chief O'Brien.

669
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:05,484
O'BRIEN:
Go ahead, Constable.

670
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,486
We need you in Security
right away.

671
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:10,363
I'm still trying to figure out
what Rom did to these systems.

672
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,240
ODO:
That'll have to wait.

673
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,034
I have Captain's orders to get
you down here immediately.

674
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,703
On my way.

675
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,538
Computer, time remaining?

676
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:21,667
COMPUTER:
36 minutes, nine seconds.

677
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:24,670
Computer, locate
Maintenance Technician Rom.

678
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,630
COMPUTER:
Maintenance Technician Rom

679
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,841
is in Security Holding Cell
Number Four.

680
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:30,467
Initiate security override

681
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:34,262
and scramble surveillance
channels 4-A, B, C and D.

682
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:37,223
Authorization:
O'Brien-seven-one-two.

683
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:39,685
COMPUTER: Specified security
channels scrambled.

684
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:42,729
Now begin recalibration
of gravitic sensors

685
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:46,817
at Access Panel 379
as indicated.

686
00:33:46,817 --> 00:33:48,485
I'll be back in ten minutes.

687
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:57,076
The Chief is here, Rom.

688
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,161
Now, what do you want

689
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,538
to say?

690
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,165
Alone.

691
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,835
I'll only talk if we're alone.

692
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:16,221
What is it, Rom?

693
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:20,099
It's okay-- I've disconnected
Odo's eavesdropping devices.

694
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:23,061
I haven't told anyone anything,
just like you said.

695
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,980
You're a good man.

696
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,648
Now, why did you call me?

697
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:29,526
I told you we're under
very tight time constraints.

698
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:31,486
Captain Sisko is<i> really</i> angry.

699
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,238
If I didn't know
he was pretending--

700
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:34,239
Rom...

701
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,448
Don't worry.

702
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,617
I can hold out
until you say otherwise,

703
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:40,913
but there is
one thing I have to know.

704
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:43,122
Go ahead.

705
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:46,334
Why are we focusing
a chroniton beam

706
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,669
at the wormhole?

707
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:49,963
What?

708
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:51,339
The new frequency

709
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,633
of the deflector grid
is set to turn the station

710
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:57,387
into a massive chroniton array
aimed directly at the wormhole.

711
00:34:57,387 --> 00:35:00,139
So, I just wanted to know...

712
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:04,269
why are we trying to kill
the wormhole aliens?

713
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,653
What are you
talking about?

714
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:16,322
The chroniton beam
is harmless.

715
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:20,410
To us, but its
temporal disruption

716
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,955
would kill a wormhole
alien instantly.

717
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:24,456
Of course.

718
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,959
Why didn't I think of that?

719
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:29,044
She has me so on edge,

720
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:30,963
I haven't been able to see
the forest for the trees.

721
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:32,213
Who's she?

722
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,591
I don't have time
to explain now.

723
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:37,469
The question is:

724
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:40,722
Why would anyone want to kill
the wormhole aliens?

725
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:43,725
Everyone has enemies,
even the Prophets.

726
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:45,477
That's right.

727
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:48,647
They're not just
wormhole aliens, they're...

728
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:50,273
they're Prophets

729
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,525
part of Bajoran mythology...

730
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:56,154
just like the Pah-wraiths
of the Fire Caves.

731
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,949
So...

732
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:01,451
what have those wraiths

733
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:04,287
got to do
with the wormhole aliens?

734
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,956
<i>Koss'moran.</i>

735
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:07,749
What?

736
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:09,167
It's a Bajoran legend.

737
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:12,045
From the verb<i> kosst</i>
meaning "to be"

738
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:15,132
and<i> amoran--</i>
"banished."

739
00:36:15,132 --> 00:36:18,593
Leeta's been telling me
all about Bajoran legends.

740
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:19,845
She can go on for hours.

741
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:22,139
She says I'm a good listener.

742
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:23,598
I'm sure you are.

743
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,725
Now it's time to be
a good talker-- go on.

744
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:28,061
Well, uh, according to Leeta,

745
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:30,772
the Pah-wraiths used to live
in the wormhole.

746
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,899
They were part
of the Celestial Temple.

747
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,026
They were Prophets.

748
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:35,234
<i>False</i> Prophets.

749
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:37,362
They were cast out
of the Temple,

750
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:38,864
exiled to the Caves,

751
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:41,324
where they were imprisoned
in crystal fire cages

752
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,493
and forbidden to ever return

753
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:47,497
"lest they face the wrath
of the true Prophets."

754
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:49,749
So if these false Prophets
were to return

755
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,376
to the Celestial Temple...

756
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:53,086
I don't think
they'd be welcomed.

757
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:58,884
Unless... she kills
all the wormhole aliens first.

758
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:03,346
Rom... I'm going to have
to leave you in a tough spot.

759
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,640
Captain Sisko, Odo--

760
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,809
they don't know
about any of this, do they?

761
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:10,520
No. No, they don't,

762
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,230
and I want you to help me
keep it that way

763
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,606
for a little while longer.

764
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,692
I have to stay here
and play the idiot?

765
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:17,152
I'm afraid so.

766
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:18,945
Now, no matter
what Odo asks you...

767
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,655
I'm Quark's brother.

768
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,281
I know the role.

769
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:25,577
(<i> sighs</i> )

770
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:28,413
Computer, time remaining?

771
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:30,874
12 minutes, 22 seconds.

772
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:45,931
(<i> Odo clears throat</i> )

773
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,228
Sorry to disturb you, Chief.

774
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:54,272
Couple of things
are still bothering me.

775
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,191
Rom couldn't have

776
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:58,026
done all this sabotage alone.

777
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:01,696
There were too many changes
for any one person to make.

778
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,489
Maybe so.

779
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:06,367
Right now, I've got a frequency
problem in the cascade feeder.

780
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,369
I checked with the repair logs.

781
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:11,706
I was hoping to match
someone's movements

782
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:14,126
to the locations
where the alterations were made,

783
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:16,335
but I couldn't do that.

784
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:19,089
We had a matrix systems
failure yesterday.

785
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:21,049
Those files were lost.
Sorry.

786
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:24,803
Hmm. We've had a lot
of systems failures recently,

787
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:25,971
haven't we, Chief?

788
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:27,346
Really?
I hadn't noticed.

789
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:29,015
I've been too busy
repairing things.

790
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:32,852
Like the surveillance channels
in the holding cells?

791
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,854
You authorized
a security override.

792
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,189
What was wrong with them?

793
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:39,109
The fiber optic relay
was out of sync.

794
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:40,902
The isolinear chip
junction was...

795
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,445
Enough, Chief.

796
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,864
You didn't cover your tracks
very well.

797
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,032
Why?

798
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,327
I didn't have time.

799
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,122
I still don't.

800
00:38:52,122 --> 00:38:53,372
(<i> groans</i> )

801
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,293
Sorry, Odo.

802
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,631
Chief O'Brien to Keiko O'Brien.

803
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:03,091
This is Keiko.

804
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:05,260
I've finished,
but we have to move quickly.

805
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,679
This place is going to be
swarming with Security.

806
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:10,389
Meet me
at Runabout Pad C now.

807
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,391
KEIKO: How did you know
I'd want a runabout?

808
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:13,810
Because I know
what you're planning to do,

809
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,561
but don't worry,
I don't give a damn

810
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:18,023
about the Celestial Temple
or your non-corporeal feuds.

811
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:19,691
I just want my wife back.

812
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:23,320
Now, you still need me to
pilot you to the wormhole.

813
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,363
So let's stop wasting time.

814
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,489
Agreed?

815
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:27,949
KEIKO:
I'll meet you there.

816
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,256
That's correct, Commander.

817
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:45,133
I want to test
some new magnetic constrictors

818
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:47,344
in the runabout's impulse
thrusters.

819
00:39:47,344 --> 00:39:49,012
DAX:
Very well, Chief.

820
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:51,556
You're cleared for departure,
but before you go,

821
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:53,641
there's one thing
I'd like to ask you.

822
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,476
What's that?

823
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:58,813
DAX:
Did you enjoy your birthday?

824
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:02,817
Well, it was full of surprises.

825
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:06,863
DAX: Good.
Those are always my favorites.

826
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:17,165
Hold position here.

827
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:20,668
Computer, initiate modifications
O'Brien-731

828
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,338
and enable remote com link.

829
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:25,631
COMPUTER:
Com link enabled.

830
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:31,596
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

831
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,014
What the hell?

832
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:38,519
Target the center
of the wormhole.

833
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,897
Target coordinates set.

834
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:42,607
Have us face the Temple.

835
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:44,692
The blast will last
only a fraction of a second.

836
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,778
They'll all be dead
before they even see it.

837
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,743
Oh! You have no idea

838
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:55,703
how many centuries
I've waited for this.

839
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,872
Let's get on with it!

840
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,791
Miles, you have a lot to learn
about patience.

841
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:02,668
Proceed.

842
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:05,297
SISKO:
Chief, what's going on
out there?

843
00:41:05,297 --> 00:41:07,632
I'm ordering you to return
to the station.

844
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:09,134
<i>Now.</i>

845
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:10,927
Activate.

846
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:18,977
(<i> screams</i> )

847
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,316
(<i> screaming</i> )

848
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:35,493
Keiko?

849
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,082
Keiko?

850
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:43,584
Miles...

851
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,670
(<i> relieved sighs</i> )

852
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,852
Chief...

853
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:03,438
you have some
explaining to do.

854
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:10,987
It was more like
having something

855
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:13,531
coiled around
inside my head.

856
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,075
I could see and hear
through it,

857
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:19,620
but anytime I tried
to do anything...

858
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:24,792
it was like being stuck
in sand and squeezed.

859
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,336
Yeah.

860
00:42:26,336 --> 00:42:28,254
Could you sense
any of its thoughts?

861
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:30,589
Just feelings, sometimes.

862
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:33,468
Kind of a cold rage.

863
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:35,845
I don't think it had
any intention

864
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:38,264
of leaving either one of us
alive.

865
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:40,975
You don't have to talk about
it if you don't want to.

866
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,768
Oh, it feels better
to talk about it.

867
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:47,690
Besides, I don't want to forget
how hard you fought for me.

868
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,294
Hello, Brother.

869
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:10,588
You look horrible.

870
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,508
I'm telling you, Rom,

871
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:14,842
working the night shift

872
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,261
is driving you
to an early grave.

873
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:17,636
I wasn't working.

874
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,514
What do you mean
you weren't working?

875
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:21,182
I'm not on
the night shift anymore.

876
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:24,352
I knew it.
O'Brien fired you.

877
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:25,395
No, Brother.

878
00:43:25,395 --> 00:43:26,896
In appreciation
of my work,

879
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:30,733
the Chief... has promoted me

880
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,777
to the day shift.

881
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:35,321
He says I have a promising
future in engineering.

882
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:36,822
Then why do you look so tired?

883
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:38,157
I was out
celebrating.

884
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:39,284
With who?

885
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:40,910
My crewmates.

886
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,620
I think they like me.

887
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,414
Do they?

888
00:43:44,414 --> 00:43:45,831
Especially Litana.

889
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:48,667
She's always finding excuses
to talk to me.

890
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:51,921
Well, Rom...

891
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:55,133
I'm glad things are going
so well for you.

892
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:56,468
No, you're not,

893
00:43:56,468 --> 00:43:59,429
but thanks anyway, Brother.

894
00:43:59,429 --> 00:44:02,723
I guess you'll be wanting
the "Chief's Special" again?

895
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,350
Actually, no.

896
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:07,770
I've discovered that bacon
doesn't agree with me.

897
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:08,729
What a surprise.

898
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,022
Instead

899
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:13,443
I'll have
a short stack of pancakes,

900
00:44:13,443 --> 00:44:16,988
dripping with butter,
a side of sausage,

901
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:19,824
and... pineapple.

902
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:21,409
Pineapple?

903
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:24,621
That's the breakfast
of choice on the day shift.

904
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:27,290
Pineapple.

905
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:30,793
(<i> sighs</i> )
