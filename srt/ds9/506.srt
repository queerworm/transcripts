1
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:20,688
Welcome to Deep Space 9.

2
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:22,731
I'm Major Kira.
I'm Dulmer.

3
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:25,024
Lucsly. Department
of Temporal Investigations.

4
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:26,318
We've been
expecting you.

5
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:27,862
DAX:
I guess you boys

6
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:30,739
from Temporal Investigations
are always on time.

7
00:00:32,867 --> 00:00:34,743
Where's Captain Sisko?

8
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:44,169
Are you sure
you don't want anything?

9
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:45,587
Just the truth, Captain.

10
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:51,134
You'll get it.

11
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,636
Where do you want to start?

12
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:53,888
The beginning.

13
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:56,306
If there<i> is</i>
such a thing.

14
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:59,685
Captain, why'd you take
the<i> Defiant</i> back in time?

15
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:00,895
It was an accident.

16
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:02,563
So you're
not contending

17
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,314
it was
a predestination paradox?

18
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,900
A time loop--
that you were

19
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,275
meant to go back
into the past.

20
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,237
Uh, no.

21
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:12,364
Good.
We hate those.

22
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:15,034
So... what happened?

23
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,537
This may take some time.

24
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:20,205
Is that a joke?

25
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,289
No.

26
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:22,249
Good.

27
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:23,918
We hate those, too.

28
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:27,629
All right, Captain,
whenever you're ready.

29
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,256
Two weeks ago,

30
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,383
the Cardassian government
contacted me

31
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:33,301
and wanted to return an Orb

32
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,302
to the Bajorans.

33
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,470
Orb?

34
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,138
They're devices
of an alien origin

35
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,724
that are considered
sacred objects

36
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:40,225
by the Bajoran people.

37
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,894
SISKO:
Each has
a unique property,

38
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:45,313
like the Orb of Prophecy
or the Orb of Wisdom.

39
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,441
The one we received
from the Cardassians

40
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:51,820
was the Orb of Time, although
we didn't know that at first.

41
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,616
SISKO:
<i>But when the</i> Defiant<i> arrived</i>
<i>at Cardassia Prime</i>

42
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,159
<i>we weren't sure if we were</i>
<i>dealing with a genuine Orb</i>

43
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,288
<i>or one of the fakes</i>
<i>that</i> <i> have cropped up</i>
<i>over the years.</i>

44
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,164
<i>I had it secured</i>
<i>in one of the crew quarters</i>

45
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:06,543
<i>so we could bring it back</i>
<i>to Bajor for authentication,</i>

46
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,088
<i>but before we left Cardassia,</i>

47
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:11,214
<i>we took on a passenger.</i>

48
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,178
Humans!

49
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:22,225
I never thought I'd see
another normal face again.

50
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,061
This is Mr. Waddle.

51
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:27,564
Yeah, Barry.
Call me Barry.

52
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,150
We are taking him back
to the Federation.

53
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,151
He was trapped on Cardassia

54
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,319
when the Klingons
attacked.

55
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,821
WADDLE:
I'm a merchant.

56
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:36,239
I deal in gemstones,
kevas and trillium mostly.

57
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,574
May I?

58
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,409
Help yourself.

59
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,120
You know what Cardassians
drink in the morning?

60
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,580
Fish juice-- hot fish juice.

61
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,206
<i>Raktajino.</i>

62
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,500
After six months,

63
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,378
I was hoping the Klingons
would invade.

64
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:53,214
Ah, at least they know
how to make coffee,

65
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:56,718
even if they are
foul-smelling barbarians.

66
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,262
S-S-Sorry.

67
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:03,433
I wouldn't take it
personally, Worf.

68
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,102
I rather like
the way you smell.

69
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:07,604
Yeah, sort
of earthy,

70
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,188
peaty aroma.

71
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:11,441
With a touch of lilac.

72
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:19,366
SISKO:
<i>With the</i> Defiant<i> under cloak,</i>
<i>we left Cardassian space</i>

73
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:23,370
<i>and managed to avoid being</i>
<i>detected by the Klingons.</i>

74
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,955
<i>We were halfway home,</i>

75
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:27,166
<i>and I was just starting</i>
<i>to breathe easy.</i>

76
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,542
Trust me.

77
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,585
Next time you see him,
just sniff the air

78
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,880
and go, "Is that lilac?"

79
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,132
No! Find somebody else.

80
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:38,677
I have my own ways
of torturing Worf.

81
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,345
Don't look at me.

82
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,264
(<i> console beeps</i> )

83
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,976
I'm picking up a massive surge
in chroniton radiation around...

84
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:54,776
What happened?

85
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,528
I don't know,
but we've dropped out of warp.

86
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,864
Sensors are coming
back on line.

87
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:01,825
Benjamin,
something's very wrong.

88
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,744
According
to the navigational computer,

89
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,412
we're over 200 light-years

90
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:06,580
from our last position.

91
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,998
O'BRIEN:
We're de-cloaking.

92
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,958
Someone's activated
the transporter.

93
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,293
Deactivate it and get
us back under cloak.

94
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,504
I'm picking up another ship
dead ahead.

95
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,547
Can you identify it?

96
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:17,298
DAX:
Not yet, but it's close,

97
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,218
very close.

98
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:21,720
Chief, I need
that viewscreen.

99
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,056
I think I've got it.

100
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,356
That's...

101
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,067
The<i> Enterprise.</i>

102
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,940
Be specific, Captain.
Which<i> Enterprise?</i>

103
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,067
There have been five.

104
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,236
Six.

105
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:45,197
This was the first<i> Enterprise,</i>
Constitution-class.

106
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,449
His ship.

107
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,577
James T. Kirk.

108
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,871
The one and only.

109
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:55,207
17 separate
temporal violations--

110
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:56,415
the biggest file on record.

111
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:57,918
Man was a menace.

112
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,254
What was the date
of your arrival?

113
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:03,173
Stardate 4523.7.

114
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,008
105 years, one month,
12 days ago.

115
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:06,551
A Friday.

116
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,887
What was the
<i>Enterprise</i> doing?

117
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:12,307
SISKO:
<i>She was orbiting one of the old</i>
<i>deep space stations-- K-7,</i>

118
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:13,892
<i>near the Klingon border.</i>

119
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,977
<i>Security reported</i>

120
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,854
<i>that just before</i>
<i>we were thrown back in time,</i>

121
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,981
<i>someone stunned the deputy</i>
<i>who was guarding the Orb</i>

122
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,816
<i>and broke into the cabin.</i>

123
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:25,779
<i>It didn't take us long</i>
<i>to realize who it was.</i>

124
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,656
His real name
is Arne Darvin--
he's a Klingon altered

125
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:29,908
to look human.

126
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,618
His surgeon
does nice work.

127
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,787
We're assuming
that he came aboard the<i> Defiant</i>

128
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:37,040
for the express purpose
of gaining access to the Orb.

129
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,418
Any idea why he brought us
back to this point in time?

130
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:40,460
We have a theory.

131
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,923
This is Darvin as he appeared
during that time period.

132
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,216
At this moment

133
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,051
he is aboard
Space Station K-7

134
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,928
posing as a Federation official.

135
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:52,013
So you're saying
he's a spy.

136
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,681
ODO:
The younger
Darvin's mission

137
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:56,435
was to derail
Federation colonization efforts

138
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:58,770
by poisoning a shipment of grain

139
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:03,691
which was... which<i> is</i> stored
aboard the station.

140
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:06,778
However, 18 hours from now,

141
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:09,781
James Kirk will expose him,
and he will be arrested.

142
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,326
That arrest
will end his career.

143
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,161
Klingon Intelligence
will turn their back on him,

144
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:16,204
and he will become an outcast.

145
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,914
From what we've been able
to piece together,

146
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,916
he spent
the next hundred years

147
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,670
eking out a meager living
posing as a human merchant.

148
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,797
Then, in a final indignity,

149
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,425
he was trapped
in Cardassian space

150
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:31,136
by the Klingon invasion.
Ah.

151
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:33,138
Until he heard rumors
about an Orb

152
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,932
capable of taking him
back in time.

153
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,600
So what is he
planning to do?

154
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,562
Contact his younger self
and warn himself about Kirk?

155
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:44,191
He could be planning
to kill Kirk.

156
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,442
The bottom line is,

157
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,110
we have to find Darvin
and stop him

158
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,737
before he has a chance
to alter history.

159
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,407
Do we know
where he beamed to?

160
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:55,910
No. He wiped the transporter
logs when he beamed out.

161
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,872
So he could be on
the<i> Enterprise</i> or the station.

162
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:02,042
We'll have to search both
without raising suspicion

163
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,044
or altering
the timeline ourselves.

164
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,004
The last thing I want

165
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:09,049
is a visit from Temporal
Investigations when we get home.

166
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:13,220
I suppose we ought
to find a way to blend in.

167
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,316
(<i> beeps</i> )

168
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:33,948
Captain.

169
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,117
Well... lieutenant,
actually.

170
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,328
I didn't want
to push my luck.

171
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,288
O'BRIEN:
Looks good
on you, sir.

172
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,376
Thank you, ensign.
Wait a minute.

173
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:46,378
Aren't you two
wearing the wrong color?

174
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:48,129
Don't you know anything
about this period in time?

175
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,673
I'm a doctor,
not an historian.

176
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:51,883
In the old days,

177
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:53,718
Operations officers
wore red.

178
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,803
Command officers
wore gold.

179
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,680
DAX:
And women wore less.

180
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,728
I think I'm going
to like history.

181
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:06,440
O'BRIEN:
The original<i> Enterprise</i>
used an old-style

182
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,191
duotronic sensor array.

183
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,860
If we wait for just
the right point
in the scan cycle,

184
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,362
we can de-cloak
the<i> Defiant</i> 

185
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:14,614
for almost three seconds
without being detected.

186
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,866
Is that enough time
to transport us aboard?

187
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:17,992
Barely.

188
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,078
Chief, here are
the coordinates.

189
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,913
The captain and I
will start on deck four

190
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:23,123
and work our way aft.

191
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,958
You and Julian
should start on deck 21...

192
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,294
And work our
way forward.

193
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,836
What about the station?

194
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:31,298
Little of it
is habitable.

195
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:34,008
Most of K-7 consists
of storage areas

196
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,094
and industrial
fabrication facilities.

197
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,845
It shouldn't take
long to search.

198
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,680
Security isn't as tight
as it is on a starship.

199
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,559
Remember--
try to avoid contact

200
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,227
with people of this
time period.

201
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:45,270
We're coming up
on a band shift

202
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,188
in the scan cycle.
Dax.

203
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:40,116
Ready?
Deck 21.

204
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,244
Deck 21.

205
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,165
I said, Deck 21.

206
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,042
Maybe if you
said please.

207
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,709
What's wrong
with this thing?

208
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,379
Don't ask me.

209
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,673
I don't know anything
about this time period.

210
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:55,756
Maybe it's jammed.

211
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,009
Take that panel
off the wall.

212
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,266
Deck 15.

213
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,940
I won't tell anyone
if you don't.

214
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,115
They really
packed them in

215
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,409
on these old ships.

216
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,660
What about over there?

217
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,078
Perfect.

218
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,247
An auxiliary
communications juncture.

219
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,998
I'll pretend
to do repairs.

220
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,458
You scan for Darvin.

221
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,293
(<i> Sisko whistles</i> )

222
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:35,338
I used to have
one of these.

223
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:39,926
Hmm. I love classic
23rd-century design.

224
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,094
Black finish...

225
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,387
silver highlights.

226
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:43,597
Dax...

227
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,683
Sorry.

228
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,476
MAN:
I don't want any more
Spican flame gems.

229
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,311
Thanks to you,

230
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,854
I already have
enough Spican flame gems
to last me a lifetime.

231
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:36,316
How sad for
you, my friend.
You won't find

232
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,816
a finer stone
anywhere...

233
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,152
What's your pleasure?

234
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,407
Uh, I'll have a<i> raktajino.</i>

235
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:45,992
You're the second person
today who ordered that.

236
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,034
What is it?

237
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,203
Klingon coffee.

238
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,622
The second person?

239
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:51,748
Who was the first?

240
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,832
An older man-- a human.

241
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,293
Where is he now?

242
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:56,461
I don't know.

243
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:58,296
He left about an hour ago.

244
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:00,047
I think he said he'd be back.

245
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:03,593
We don't have
any Klingon beverages.

246
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,637
Would you like something else?

247
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,141
Um...
Tarkalean tea.

248
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,601
Okay.

249
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,603
JONES:
You're a difficult
man to reach

250
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:14,853
but I have something

251
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:17,064
from the far reaches
of the galaxy.

252
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,065
Surely you want--

253
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,066
Not at your price.

254
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,235
Ooh, what is it?

255
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,945
Is it alive?

256
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,989
May I hold it?

257
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,407
(<i> cooing</i> )

258
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:30,244
UHURA:
Oh, it's adorable.

259
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,121
What is it?

260
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:43,383
Chief, you're supposed
to be working.

261
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,802
I'm afraid
to touch anything.

262
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:48,638
It's all cross-circuited
and patched together.

263
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,598
I can't make
head nor tails of it.

264
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,475
Sounds like one
of your repair jobs.

265
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:53,934
(<i> both chuckle</i> )

266
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,563
Well, there's no sign of
Darvin in this section.

267
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:59,940
I'm going to have
to widen the scan radius.

268
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,360
If I can figure out how.

269
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,238
Well, keep the scan field
below 20 milliwatts.

270
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,281
Otherwise, you'll set off
the internal sensors.

271
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:10,076
Thank you, Chief.
I was listening during
the mission briefing.

272
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,954
What are you two
doing here?

273
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,582
Scotty told me to do this.

274
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:19,460
Oh, you were
going to... do this?

275
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,337
It's on the duty roster.

276
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,840
Must have been...
some mix-up.

277
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,384
Isn't that a medical tricorder?

278
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,511
Yes. Yes, it is.

279
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,555
I'm a doctor.

280
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:33,349
Why do we need a doctor
to repair a power relay?

281
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,309
You don't...

282
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,270
obviously.

283
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,480
No. I'm doing a study.

284
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,650
It... has to do with...
work-related stress.

285
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,612
Oh.

286
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,488
Why don't you two, um, go on?

287
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,948
Pretend I'm not here.

288
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,075
So where should we start?

289
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,744
Well...

(<i> clears throat</i> )

291
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,205
obviously, the...
first thing

292
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,708
we should do is
to take this, uh...

293
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,668
this transtator here...

294
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,169
and...

been getting to him.

Why don't you
take over?

300
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,308
All right, Ensign.

301
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,059
I think I've
seen enough.

302
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,812
Let's get you
back to Sick Bay.

303
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,229
Oh.

304
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,189
Oh, uh, I'd appreciate it

305
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,984
if you wouldn't
mention this to anyone.

306
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,319
No problem.

307
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,195
Hope you feel better.

308
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:42,877

From a man named
Cyrano Jones.

The feeling's mutual.

324
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:27,463
They are detestable creatures.

Hmm. Interesting.

326
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,300
It's been my observation

327
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,095
that most humanoids
love soft, furry animals

328
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:38,057
especially if they make
pleasing sounds.

329
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,310
They do nothing
but consume food and breed.

330
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,479
If you feed that thing
more than the smallest morsel,

331
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,857
in a few hours,
you'll have ten tribbles,

332
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:46,816
then a hundred,
then a thousand.

333
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:47,984
Calm down.

334
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,193

of the Klingon Empire.

A mortal enemy of the Empire?

338

They were an ecological menace,
a plague to be wiped out.

of the 23rd century,

00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,601
KIRA:
<i>Defiant</i> here.

359
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,185
Report.

360
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,146
A Klingon D7 battle cruiser
just dropped out of warp.

361
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,689
It's approaching the station.

362
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,024
Have they locked weapons?

363
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,152
Not yet.

364
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,488
Kira, can you identify
the Klingon vessel?

365
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:20,743
The IKS<i> Gr'oth.</i>

366
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:22,161
That's Koloth's ship.

367
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,496
Curzon's old friend?

368
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,373
Yes, and he isn't
going to attack.

369
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:29,961
I remember Koloth telling me
he once traded insults with Kirk

370
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:32,880
on a space station
near the Federation border.

371
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,134
He always regretted
never getting the chance
to face him in battle.

372
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:38,845
The Klingon ship
just transported two people

373
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:41,139
to the Station Manager's office,
Captain.

374
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:43,099
That's Koloth.

375
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:45,643
Maybe we should beam over
to the station

376
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,020
to help Odo and Worf.

377
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,896
We know Darvin was there
a few hours ago.

378
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,397
I think it
might be better

379
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,942
if Chief O'Brien
and Dr. Bashir go.

380
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:56,654
But if<i> we</i> went,
we might run into Koloth.

381
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,238
Exactly.

382
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:01,325
It's not as if he
would recognize me.

383
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,285
I'd love to see him
at his prime.

384
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,996
Dax.

385
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:07,957
Major, beam the chief
and the doctor to K-7

386
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:09,583
and fill them in.

387
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,002
Aye, sir.

388
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,006
It would have been fun.

389
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:18,384
Too much fun.

390
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:21,012
SISKO:
<i>Dax was right</i>
<i>about the Klingons.</i>

391
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:23,305
<i>They were only interested</i>
<i>in shore leave,</i>

392
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,265
<i>and Captain Kirk allowed them</i>

393
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,518
<i>to beam aboard the station</i>
<i>in small groups.</i>

394
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,854
<i>When the</i> Enterprise<i> stood down</i>
<i>from Red Alert,</i>

395
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:32,773
<i>we all resumed our search</i>
<i>for Darvin.</i>

396
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,608
KIRA:
The next band shift

397
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,986
in the<i> Enterprise</i> scan cycle
will be in three minutes.

398
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,363
We'll be ready, Major.
O'Brien out.

399
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,907
We should find
a turbolift.

400
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,211
Hello again.

401
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:55,088
Hello.

402
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,801
Deck Ten.

403
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,849
Your flap's open.

404
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:09,894
Excuse me?

405
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:12,521
On your tricorder.

406
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,148
You're
draining power.

407
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:16,776
Oh...
thank you.

408
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:20,613
He's always doing that.

409
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,781
You're a doctor?

410
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,032
Yes.

411
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,533
I just transferred here

412
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,410
from the<i> Lexington</i> last week.

413
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,370
Welcome aboard.

414
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:32,208
I'm coming into Sick Bay
tomorrow for my physical.

415
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,465
1500.

416
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,092
Lieutenant Watley.

417
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:48,682
You realize, of course,
she was just using you

418
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,268
to get to me?

419
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:52,186
Watley...

420
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:54,814
that was my great-
grandmother's name.

421
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,023
Funny.

422
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,234
And I think she
was in Starfleet.

423
00:21:58,234 --> 00:21:59,526
Well, it's
a common enough name.

424
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,361
But what if
that<i> was</i> her?

425
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,156
Do you realize
the odds?

426
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,076
No one ever met
my great-grandfather.

427
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:09,745
This could be a
predestination paradox.

428
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,165
Come on, Chief.
Surely you
took elementary

429
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:13,916
temporal mechanics
at the Academy.

430
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,501
I could be destined

431
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:17,128
to fall in love
with that woman

432
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:21,423
and become my own
great-grandfather.

433
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,591
You're being ridiculous.

434
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,468
Ridiculous?

435
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,220
If I don't meet with her
tomorrow, I may never be born!

436
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,430
KIRA:
Chief, are you ready
for transport?

437
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,431
Are we ever.

438
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,850
Stand by.

439
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,893
You saw the way
she looked at me.

440
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,478
You can't just dismiss this.

441
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:35,604
I can try.

442
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,064
All right.

443
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:39,859
Fine,

444
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,277
but I can't wait to get
back to Deep Space 9

445
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:42,611
and see your face
when you find out

446
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,280
that I never existed.

447
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,532
(<i> chuckling</i> )

448
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:55,624
SISKO:
<i>Dax and I resumed our search</i>
<i>for Darvin.</i>

449
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:58,127
Benjamin, look.

450
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:05,218
CHEKOV:
Bridge to Captain Kirk.

451
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,889
Kirk here.
Mr. Baris is waiting

452
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,765
on Channel E
to speak to you, sir.

453
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:14,101
Keep working.
We're a maintenance crew
just doing our job.

454
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,062
Mr. Baris is coming on.

455
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:17,771
Yes, Mr. Baris,
what can I do for you?

456
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:20,816
BARIS:
Kirk, this station
is swarming with Klingons.

457
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,568
I was not aware, Mr. Baris,

458
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,945
that 12 Klingons
constitutes a swarm.

459
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,404
Captain Kirk, I consider

460
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:28,490
your security measures
a disgrace.

461
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,202
In my opinion,
you have taken this entire...

462
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:32,536
I had no idea.

463
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,038
What?

464
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:37,457
He's so much more
handsome in person.

465
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:38,834
Those eyes.

466
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,502
Kirk had quite
the reputation

467
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,462
as a ladies' man.

468
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:45,549
Not him-- Spock.

469
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:48,386
BARIS:
...free and complete access
to this station

470
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:50,679
for that man who just
walked out of here--

471
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,390
Let's go.

472
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,934
Mr. Baris, I have guards
around the grain.

473
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:57,019
I have guards around
the Klingons.

474
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,478
I can't believe
you don't at least

475
00:23:58,478 --> 00:23:59,980
want to meet
Captain Kirk.

476
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,399
That's the last thing
on my mind.

477
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:04,860
Oh, come on, Benjamin,
are you telling me

478
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,113
you're not the tiniest
bit interested in meeting

479
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:09,740
one of the most famous
men in Starfleet history?

480
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,991
We have a job to do.

481
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:14,078
But it's...
it's James Kirk.

482
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:16,205
Look, of course,
I want to meet him.

483
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:19,708
I'd like to shake his hand,
ask him about...

484
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,919
fighting the Gorn
on Cestus III.

485
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,629
But that's not why
we're here, old man.

486
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:27,174
You're right.

487
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,926
I guess the difference
between you and me is

488
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:30,428
I remember this time.

489
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:32,972
I lived in this
time, and it's...

490
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:35,849
it's hard to not want
to be a part of it again.

491
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,618
Clearly, we've been
going about

492
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,329
this search business
all wrong, Chief.

493
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:59,081
You're right.
Why bother searching

494
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:00,791
30 decks when you can
just plunk yourself down

495
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:03,585
at the bar here
and wait for Darvin
to come to you?

496
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,087
We have reason
to believe

497
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:07,214
that he'll return
to this area.

498
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:10,343
Ah, yes, the<i> raktajino.</i>

499
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:13,179
A vital clue that others
might have missed.

500
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:14,512
How fortunate it is

501
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:16,140
that it has kept you
stuck at this bar

502
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,685
for the past three
hours having drinks

503
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:22,188
while we've been crawling
through conduits.

504
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,484
My God, that's him.

505
00:25:26,484 --> 00:25:27,567
Who?

506
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:28,694
Kirk.

507
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:29,736
Where?

508
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,155
The one on the left

509
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:32,781
in the gold,
just sitting down.

510
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,741
That's Kirk?

511
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:40,289
It would be an honor
to meet him.

512
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:42,249
Let's buy him a drink.

513
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:43,501
Gentlemen...

514
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:46,462
no one is buying
anyone a drink.

515
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,255
He's right.

516
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:51,842
We can't risk altering
the timeline.

517
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:58,224
What'll it be, boys?
And don't ask for<i> raktajino.</i>

518
00:25:58,224 --> 00:25:59,683
If I have to say we don't
carry that one more...

519
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:00,684
Who ordered
a<i> raktajino?</i>

520
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,478
The Klingons.

521
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:03,896
Klingons?

522
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:05,439
Over there.

523
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:07,816
And over there.

524
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:10,777
Those are Klingons?

525
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:13,906
All right, you boys
have had enough.

526
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:22,122
Mr. Worf?

527
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:29,838
They<i> are</i> Klingons,
and it is a long story.

528
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,048
What happened?

529
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:32,925
Some kind
of genetic engineering?

530
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,718
A viral mutation?

531
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:37,637
We do not discuss it
with outsiders.

532
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:39,557
(<i> chair scraping</i> )

533
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:41,141
Take it easy, lad.

534
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:44,019
Everybody's entitled
to an opinion.

535
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,687
That's right,

536
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,398
and if I think

537
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:52,361
that Kirk is a Denebian
slime devil,

538
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:55,155
well, that's
my opinion, too.

539
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:57,699
Don't do it, mister,
and that's an order.

540
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:00,202
But you heard what he called
the Captain.

541
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:02,121
Look at the way Kirk
is ignoring that Klingon.

542
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:04,081
He's letting
his security officer handle it.

543
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:06,125
Chief, are you sure
that's Kirk?

544
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,543
Absolutely.

545
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:09,378
Why is he wearing
lieutenant's stripes?

546
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:11,088
KLINGON:
...saggy, old rust...

547
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:12,839
I think we've got
bigger problems

548
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,467
than a case
of mistaken identity.

549
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:15,759
...garbage scow.

550
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,220
Half the Quadrant knows it.

551
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:21,348
That's why they're learning
to speak Klingonese.

552
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,350
(<i> Klingon laughing</i> )

553
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,935
Mr. Scott.

554
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:28,481
Laddie...

555
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:32,568
don't you think you should...
rephrase that?

556
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:34,487
You're right.

557
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:36,238
I should.

558
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:38,157
I didn't mean to say

559
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:41,327
that the<i> Enterprise</i>
should be hauling garbage.

560
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:46,790
I meant to say that it should
be hauled away<i> as</i> garbage.

561
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:50,668
(<i> Klingon laughing</i> )

562
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:04,099
What are you doing?

563
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:12,232
(<i> yells</i> )

564
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,485
(<i> growling</i> )

565
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:26,746
(<i> grunts</i> )

566
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:46,725
(<i> grunting</i> )

567
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:20,967
It's Darvin!

568
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,457
Your men could've avoided
that fight, Captain.

569
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:54,710
Regulation 157,
Section Three, Paragraph 18:

570
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:58,338
"Starfleet officers shall take
all necessary precautions

571
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,633
"to minimize any participation

572
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:02,760
in historical events."

573
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,638
All right.

574
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:07,055
It was a mistake.

575
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,725
But there were
no lasting repercussions.

576
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:11,184
How do you know that?

577
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,811
For all we know,
we could be living

578
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,605
in an alternate timeline
right now.

579
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:16,856
If my people had caused
any changes in the timeline,

580
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:20,694
we would've been the first
to notice when we got back.

581
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:23,447
Why do they all
have to say that?

582
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:24,864
So...

583
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:27,409
your men were arrested...

584
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:30,537
SISKO:
<i>That's right, but instead</i>
<i>of being taken to the brig,</i>

585
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:34,541
<i>they were brought</i>
<i>in for questioning.</i>

586
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,669
I want to know
who started it.

587
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:37,961
I'm waiting.

588
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:41,799
Who started the fight?

589
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:43,717
I don't know, sir.

590
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:46,136
All right.

591
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:49,139
Chekov...
I know you.

592
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:50,599
You started it, didn't you?

593
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:51,850
No, sir.
I didn't.

594
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,976
Well, who did?

595
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,687
I don't know, sir.

596
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:58,482
"I don't know, sir."

597
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:01,568
I want to know who
threw the first punch.

598
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,029
All right, you're all
confined to quarters

599
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:05,864
until I find out
who started it.

600
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,324
Dismissed.

601
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,998
That was close.

602
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,668
Me-- of all the people
in the lineup,

603
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:19,753
he asks<i> me</i> who threw
the first punch.

604
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:21,588
And you lied to him.

605
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,089
I lied to Captain Kirk.

606
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,758
I wish Keiko could've
been here to see it.

607
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:26,760
(<i> loud squeaking</i> )

608
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,554
(<i> cooing</i> )

609
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:31,181
I'm sorry about that,
little fellow.

610
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:34,309
Who left you out
here all alone?

611
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:41,024
He's not alone.

612
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:46,988
(<i> tribbles cooing</i> )

613
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,752
Welcome back,
Mr. Darvin.

614
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:01,754
The pleasure is all mine.

615
00:32:01,754 --> 00:32:02,796
(<i> grunts</i> )

616
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:05,758
Worf...
hold on.

617
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:08,385
I hope you realize
you'll be facing

618
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:12,472
some very serious charges
when we get back.

619
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,975
You wouldn't dare

620
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:18,061
put one of the greatest heroes
of the Klingon Empire

621
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,063
into the brig.

622
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:23,024
You are no hero to the Empire.

623
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,735
I will be.

624
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:26,486
I've been thinking
about my statue

625
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:27,821
in the Hall
of Warriors.

626
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:30,699
I want it to capture
my essence.

627
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:33,660
Our statues can be so...

628
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,788
generic sometimes,
don't you think?

629
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:37,289
I take it whatever
your plan is,

630
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:39,708
you've already set it
in motion.

631
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:43,253
I see myself standing
with Kirk's head in one hand...

632
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,883
and a tribble in the other.

633
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:50,469
What have you done?

634
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:53,472
Did you hire someone
to kill him?

635
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:55,223
Did you sabotage the<i> Enterprise?</i>

636
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,601
Nothing so mundane.

637
00:32:57,601 --> 00:33:00,228
Let's just say
that Kirk's death

638
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:03,189
will have a certain
poetic justice to it.

639
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,944
(<i> laughing</i> )

640
00:33:06,944 --> 00:33:08,737
He put a bomb in a tribble?

641
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:10,572
ODO:
It's his revenge.

642
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:13,575
Originally, Kirk saw
how a tribble reacted

643
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:15,702
to Darvin and realized
that he was a Klingon.

644
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,788
He wouldn't say
where this tribble was,

645
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:21,583
but he did say that it was set
to go off within the hour.

646
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,878
It could be anywhere.

647
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:27,464
Benjamin, I think we should risk
going to the Bridge.

648
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:28,841
If we can use
the internal sensors,

649
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:31,677
we can scan the entire ship
for explosives

650
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:33,679
in a matter of seconds.

651
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,431
Dax and I will take care
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

652
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:37,933
The rest of you
beam over to K-7

653
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:38,976
and start searching there.

654
00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:40,727
Understood.

655
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:44,898
But I think Mr. Worf
should remain here.

656
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:48,861
It seems he's...
allergic

657
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:50,988
to tribbles.
All right.

658
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:52,990
O'BRIEN:
Captain,

659
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:55,659
I'm not sure we can get
to K-7's internal sensors.

660
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:57,452
Then you will have
to manually scan

661
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,162
every tribble
on the station.

662
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,831
There must be thousands
of them by now.

663
00:34:00,831 --> 00:34:01,915
Hundreds of thousands.

664
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:06,294
1,771,561.

665
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,922
That's starting with one tribble
with an average litter of ten

666
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:10,507
every 12 hours.

667
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:11,508
After three days--

668
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:12,592
Thank you.

669
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:16,930
You have your orders, people.
Sisko out.

670
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:36,033
(<i> squeaking</i> )

671
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,538
(<i> cooing</i> )

672
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,807
Dr. McCoy, would you mind
coming up to the bridge?

673
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,702
I rerouted
the sensor interface.

674
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,247
It worked.

675
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,332
I'm scanning the bridge.

676
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,211
Nothing up here.

677
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,380
That's a relief.

678
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,882
When Kirk
sat on that tribble,

679
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:35,592
I half expected it
to go off.

680
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,596
Nothing on
the first six decks.

681
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:44,183
McCOY:
Did you want
to see me, Jim?

682
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:49,439
Well, don't look at me.
It's the tribbles
who are breeding.

683
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:51,441
I know him.

684
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:53,860
That must be McCoy,
the ship's doctor.

685
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,404
McCoy...

686
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:59,491
McCoy...

687
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,159
Well, the nearest thing
I can figure out

688
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,661
is that they're
<i>born</i> pregnant...

689
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:05,497
which seems to be
quite a time saver.

690
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:08,333
Leonard McCoy.

691
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:11,086
I met him when he was
a student at Ole Miss.

692
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:12,295
Who met him-- Curzon?

693
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,546
No.

694
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,465
My host at the time was Emony.

695
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:18,677
She was on Earth judging
a gymnastics competition.

696
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:20,846
I had a feeling
he'd become a doctor.

697
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:25,684
He had the hands of a surgeon.

698
00:36:30,147 --> 00:36:32,024
I've scanned every deck.

699
00:36:32,024 --> 00:36:34,526
The bomb's not aboard the ship.

700
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:37,696
Then it must be somewhere
on K-7.

701
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,772
(<i> cooing</i> )

702
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:26,203
(<i> com link beeps</i> )
Odo here.

703
00:37:26,203 --> 00:37:28,830
The bomb's not on
the<i> Enterprise;</i>
it must be over there.

704
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,124
We've only been able
to get through two decks.

705
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:33,251
We're running out of time.
I can send more teams
from the<i> Defiant.</i>

706
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,503
It's not a question
of manpower.

707
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,756
It's a question
of multiplication.

708
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:39,925
The tribbles are breeding so
fast we can't keep up with them.

709
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:42,844
Benjamin, maybe we could
narrow things down a little.

710
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:44,721
Presumably, Darvin
put the bomb

711
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:46,264
somewhere
he knows Kirk

712
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,432
is going to be
in the next half an hour,

713
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:49,517
so if we stick close
to Kirk...

714
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,144
He might lead us
right to it.

715
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:53,312
It's worth a try,
but there's no reason

716
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:55,356
for us to stop searching
over here.

717
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,109
Keep at it
for now, Constable.

718
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:59,485
Deck Five.

719
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,172
This is my chicken sandwich
and coffee.

720
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:21,424
I want these things
off the ship.

721
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:23,509
I don't care if it takes
every man we've got.
I want them off the ship.

722
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,598
Aye, they're into the
machinery, all right,

723
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:30,892
and they're probably
in all the other

724
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:32,060
food processors, too.

725
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,228
How?

726
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:34,687
Probably through one
of the air vents.

727
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,689
Captain, there are vents
of that type

728
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,024
on the space station.

729
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,859
KIRK:
And in the storage
compartments.

730
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,945
Storage
compartments.

731
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:43,446
Storage compartments.

732
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,240
KIRK:
...meet us near
the storage compartments.

733
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,407
We're beaming down.

734
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,215
Most of these are dead.

735
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:04,050
The grain's poisoned.

736
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,636
I'm picking up a faint
tricobalt signature.

737
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,721
The bomb's under
here somewhere.

738
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:13,768
(<i> beeping</i> )
What's that?

739
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,937
It's not working, sir.
It seems to be stuck.

740
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,105
Here, let me try.

741
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:22,902
Someone's trying to
open the bay door.

742
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,071
(<i> beeping</i> )

743
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:27,740
(<i> beeping</i> )

744
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:34,914
(<i> beeping</i> )

745
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:51,639
Benjamin, it's right
here in front of us.

746
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:06,988
(<i> sighs</i> )

747
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:11,868
They seem
to be gorged.

748
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:14,287
Gorged?!
On my grain?!

749
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:17,415
Kirk, I am going
to hold you responsible!

750
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,667
Must be thousands of them.

751
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,044
Hundreds of thousands.

752
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:24,756
1,771,561.

753
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,925
That's assuming one
tribble multiplying

754
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:30,095
with an average litter of ten
producing a new generation

755
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:32,513
every 12 hours over
a period of three days.

756
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:33,973
(<i> tricorder beeps</i> )

757
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,267
I found it.

758
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:42,232
Sisko to<i> Defiant.</i>

759
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:43,275
Go ahead, Captain.

760
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:44,525
I found the bomb.

761
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,319
Lock on to my tricorder signal

762
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:47,612
and beam it into space.

763
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:48,780
Acknowledged.

764
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:12,887
Kira to Sisko.

765
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,722
It worked.

766
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,433
KIRK:
And as Captain,
I want two things done.

767
00:41:16,433 --> 00:41:17,642
First, find Cyrano Jones...

768
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:18,810
and second...

769
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,689
close that door.

770
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:26,276
SISKO:
<i>After the bomb was detonated,</i>

771
00:41:26,276 --> 00:41:27,777
<i>history continued</i>
<i>uninterrupted.</i>

772
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:29,612
<i>And thanks to the tribbles,</i>

773
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:32,490
<i>Kirk was able to uncover</i>
<i>the truth about Darvin.</i>

774
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,452
(<i> shrill chattering</i> )

775
00:41:35,452 --> 00:41:37,120
They don't like you,
Mr. Darvin.

776
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,872
I wonder why? Bones?

777
00:41:46,463 --> 00:41:48,256
Jim, this man is a Klingon.

778
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:56,639
SISKO:
<i>By the time we returned</i>
<i>to the</i> Defiant,

779
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,766
<i>Major Kira had discovered</i>
<i>how to use the Orb</i>

780
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,936
<i>to bring us back</i>
<i>to our own time.</i>

781
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,938
And that's when you
returned to the present?

782
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:07,275
Well... not exactly.

783
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:10,569
Before we left,

784
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:15,283
I realized there was one
last thing I had to do--

785
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:17,494
<i>something I'd been</i>
<i>thinking about</i>

786
00:42:17,494 --> 00:42:20,455
<i>ever since I saw that ship</i>
<i>on the viewscreen.</i>

787
00:42:21,498 --> 00:42:23,624
Excuse me, Captain.

788
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,502
Here's tomorrow's duty roster
for your approval.

789
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:28,004
Lieutenant, uh...
Lieutenant...

790
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:29,547
Benjamin Sisko, sir.

791
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,716
I've been
on temporary assignment here.

792
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:34,135
Before I leave,
I just want to say...

793
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:37,055
it's been an honor
serving with you, sir.

794
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,726
All right, lieutenant,
carry on.

795
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:42,768
Thank you, sir.

796
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:48,900
Now...

797
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:53,446
if you want to put
a letter of reprimand

798
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:55,614
in my file for that,
then go ahead.

799
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:57,783
We'll have
to review the case

800
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:59,536
before making any
recommendations.

801
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:01,996
However, I don't think
there was any harm done.

802
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,624
Probably would have done
the same thing myself.

803
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:13,841
You'll be receiving our report
in about a month.

804
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:16,886
But based on what
you've told us,

805
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:18,555
I don't think you have
anything to worry about.

806
00:43:18,555 --> 00:43:20,139
I'm glad to hear it.

807
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:22,850
Good-bye, Captain.
Good-bye.

808
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:28,273
Docking Port Seven.

809
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,153
It went well?

810
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,490
Good.

811
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:41,286
The Constable wants to
see us on the Promenade.

812
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:42,870
Did you tell them?

813
00:43:44,456 --> 00:43:46,458
They didn't ask.

814
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:50,669
I'm open to
suggestions, people.

815
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:53,465
We could build
another station.

816
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,889
(<i> tribbles cooing</i> )
