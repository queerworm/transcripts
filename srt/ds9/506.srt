1
00:00:20,408 --> 00:00:21,900
Welcome to Deep Space 9.

2
00:00:21,944 --> 00:00:22,912
I'm Major Kira.

3
00:00:22,946 --> 00:00:24,176
I'm Dulmer.

4
00:00:24,216 --> 00:00:26,483
Lucsly. Department
of Temporal Investigations.

5
00:00:26,522 --> 00:00:27,889
We've been expecting you.

6
00:00:27,925 --> 00:00:29,224
I guess you boys

7
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:32,462
from Temporal Investigations
are always on time.

8
00:00:34,474 --> 00:00:36,274
Where's Captain Sisko?

9
00:00:43,061 --> 00:00:45,625
Are you sure
you don't want anything?

10
00:00:45,668 --> 00:00:47,160
Just the truth, Captain.

11
00:00:51,482 --> 00:00:52,644
You'll get it.

12
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:53,984
Where do you want to start?

13
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:55,080
The beginning.

14
00:00:55,124 --> 00:00:57,459
If there is such a thing.

15
00:00:57,496 --> 00:01:01,062
Captain, why'd you take
the <i>Defiant</i> back in time?

16
00:01:01,104 --> 00:01:02,129
It was an accident.

17
00:01:02,174 --> 00:01:03,700
So you're not contending

18
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,578
it was
a predestination paradox?

19
00:01:05,616 --> 00:01:08,646
A time loop... that you were
meant to go back into the past.

20
00:01:09,658 --> 00:01:11,492
Uh, no.

21
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,498
Good.

22
00:01:12,532 --> 00:01:13,522
We hate those.

23
00:01:13,568 --> 00:01:16,473
So... what happened?

24
00:01:18,112 --> 00:01:19,706
This may take some time.

25
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:21,652
Is that a joke?

26
00:01:21,687 --> 00:01:22,484
No.

27
00:01:22,522 --> 00:01:23,490
Good.

28
00:01:23,525 --> 00:01:25,119
We hate those, too.

29
00:01:25,162 --> 00:01:29,001
All right, Captain,
whenever you're ready.

30
00:01:29,038 --> 00:01:30,564
Two weeks ago

31
00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:32,603
the Cardassian government
contacted me

32
00:01:32,647 --> 00:01:34,515
and wanted to return an Orb

33
00:01:34,551 --> 00:01:35,519
to the Bajorans.

34
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:36,716
Orb?

35
00:01:36,756 --> 00:01:38,419
They're devices
of an alien origin

36
00:01:38,461 --> 00:01:40,055
that are considered
sacred objects

37
00:01:40,098 --> 00:01:41,533
by the Bajoran people.

38
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:43,333
Each has a unique property

39
00:01:43,406 --> 00:01:46,903
like the Orb of Prophecy
or the Orb of Wisdom.

40
00:01:46,948 --> 00:01:49,078
The one we received
from the Cardassians

41
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,358
was the Orb of Time, although
we didn't know that at first.

42
00:01:53,464 --> 00:01:57,235
But when the <i>Defiant</i> arrived
at Cardassia Prime

43
00:01:57,273 --> 00:01:59,871
we weren't sure if we were
dealing with a genuine Orb

44
00:01:59,913 --> 00:02:02,852
or one of the fakes that
have cropped up over the years.

45
00:02:02,886 --> 00:02:04,549
I had it secured
in one of the crew quarters

46
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,224
so we could bring it back
to Bajor for authentication

47
00:02:08,265 --> 00:02:10,634
but before we left Cardassia

48
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,939
we took on a passenger.

49
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,651
Humans!

50
00:02:20,696 --> 00:02:24,000
I never thought I'd see
another normal face again.

51
00:02:24,036 --> 00:02:25,665
This is Mr. Waddle.

52
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:29,149
Yeah, Barry.
Call me Barry.

53
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:31,747
We are taking him back
to the Federation.

54
00:02:31,788 --> 00:02:33,691
He was trapped on Cardassia
when the Klingons attacked.

55
00:02:33,727 --> 00:02:34,957
I'm a merchant.

56
00:02:34,997 --> 00:02:37,993
I deal in gemstones,
kevas and trillium mostly.

57
00:02:38,037 --> 00:02:39,301
May I?

58
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,037
Help yourself.

59
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,740
You know what Cardassians
drink in the morning?

60
00:02:42,782 --> 00:02:45,311
Fish juice... hot fish juice.

61
00:02:45,354 --> 00:02:46,789
<i>Raktajino.</i>

62
00:02:46,824 --> 00:02:48,123
After six months

63
00:02:48,161 --> 00:02:51,966
I was hoping the Klingons
would invade.

64
00:02:52,003 --> 00:02:54,874
Ah, at least they know
how to make coffee

65
00:02:54,911 --> 00:02:56,745
even if they are
foul-smelling barbarians.

66
00:02:59,488 --> 00:03:01,048
S-S-Sorry.

67
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:04,962
I wouldn't take it personally,
Worf.

68
00:03:05,002 --> 00:03:06,767
I rather like the way you smell.

69
00:03:06,806 --> 00:03:10,748
Yeah, a sort of earthy,
peaty aroma.

70
00:03:10,782 --> 00:03:13,151
With a touch of lilac.

71
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:21,003
With the <i>Defiant</i> under cloak,
we left Cardassian space

72
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,947
and managed to avoid
being detected by the Klingons.

73
00:03:24,983 --> 00:03:26,111
We were halfway home

74
00:03:26,152 --> 00:03:28,954
and I was just starting
to breathe easy.

75
00:03:28,992 --> 00:03:30,086
Trust me.

76
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:32,293
Next time you see him,
just sniff the air

77
00:03:32,334 --> 00:03:34,567
and go, "Is that lilac?"

78
00:03:34,606 --> 00:03:36,839
No! Find somebody else.

79
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:40,444
I have my own ways
of torturing Worf.

80
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:42,149
Don't look at me.

81
00:03:44,797 --> 00:03:47,827
I'm picking up a massive surge
in chroniton radiation around...

82
00:03:55,355 --> 00:03:56,449
What happened?

83
00:03:56,492 --> 00:03:58,189
I don't know,
but we've dropped out of warp.

84
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:00,462
Sensors are coming back on line.

85
00:04:00,501 --> 00:04:03,565
Benjamin,
something's very wrong.

86
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:05,477
According
to the navigational computer

87
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:06,948
we're over 200 light-years

88
00:04:06,983 --> 00:04:08,418
from our last position.

89
00:04:08,453 --> 00:04:09,717
We're de-cloaking.

90
00:04:09,756 --> 00:04:11,693
Someone's activated
the transporter.

91
00:04:11,728 --> 00:04:13,926
Deactivate it
and get us back under cloak.

92
00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:16,268
I'm picking up another ship
dead ahead.

93
00:04:16,305 --> 00:04:17,330
Can you identify it?

94
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,106
Not yet, but it's close

95
00:04:19,145 --> 00:04:20,876
very close.

96
00:04:20,917 --> 00:04:23,617
Chief, I need that viewscreen.

97
00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:25,889
I think I've got it.

98
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,148
That's...

99
00:04:35,184 --> 00:04:36,915
The <i>Enterprise.</i>

100
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:40,293
Be specific, Captain.
Which <i>Enterprise?</i>

101
00:06:40,331 --> 00:06:41,561
There have been five.

102
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,537
Six.

103
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:46,669
This was the first <i>Enterprise,</i>
Constitution-class.

104
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,646
His ship.

105
00:06:49,686 --> 00:06:51,782
James T. Kirk.

106
00:06:51,825 --> 00:06:54,194
The one and only.

107
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,463
17 separate
temporal violations...

108
00:06:56,502 --> 00:06:57,664
the biggest file on record.

109
00:06:57,705 --> 00:06:59,106
Man was a menace.

110
00:06:59,142 --> 00:07:01,272
What was the date
of your arrival?

111
00:07:01,314 --> 00:07:04,219
Stardate 4523.7.

112
00:07:04,254 --> 00:07:06,019
105 years, one month,
12 days ago.

113
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,187
A Friday.

114
00:07:07,228 --> 00:07:09,290
What was the <i>Enterprise</i> doing?

115
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:13,298
She was orbiting one of the old
deep space stations... K-7

116
00:07:13,343 --> 00:07:14,937
near the Klingon border.

117
00:07:15,013 --> 00:07:16,346
Security reported

118
00:07:16,383 --> 00:07:18,445
that just before
we were thrown back in time

119
00:07:18,488 --> 00:07:21,188
someone stunned the Deputy
who was guarding the Orb

120
00:07:21,228 --> 00:07:22,754
and broke into the cabin.

121
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:26,832
It didn't take us long
to realize who it was.

122
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,640
His real name is Arne Darvin...

123
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:30,843
he's a Klingon altered
to look human.

124
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:32,615
His surgeon does nice work.

125
00:07:32,656 --> 00:07:34,718
We're assuming
that he came aboard the <i>Defiant</i>

126
00:07:34,761 --> 00:07:37,893
for the express purpose
of gaining access to the Orb.

127
00:07:37,935 --> 00:07:40,429
Any idea why he brought us
back to this point in time?

128
00:07:40,475 --> 00:07:41,671
We have a theory.

129
00:07:43,148 --> 00:07:46,019
This is Darvin as he appeared
during that time period.

130
00:07:46,088 --> 00:07:49,118
At this moment,
he is aboard Space Station K-7

131
00:07:49,162 --> 00:07:50,893
posing as a Federation official.

132
00:07:50,932 --> 00:07:52,960
So you're saying he's a spy.

133
00:07:53,004 --> 00:07:54,667
The younger Darvin's mission

134
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:57,443
was to derail
Federation colonization efforts

135
00:07:57,482 --> 00:07:59,783
by poisoning a shipment of grain

136
00:07:59,821 --> 00:08:04,629
which was... which is stored
aboard the station.

137
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:07,696
However, 18 hours from now

138
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,736
James Kirk will expose him,
and he will be arrested.

139
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,183
That arrest will end his career.

140
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,214
Klingon Intelligence
will turn their back on him

141
00:08:15,257 --> 00:08:17,455
and he will become an outcast.

142
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,365
From what we've been able
to piece together

143
00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:21,201
he spent the next hundred years

144
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:25,010
eking out a meager living
posing as a human merchant.

145
00:08:25,048 --> 00:08:27,178
Then, in a final indignity

146
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,852
he was trapped
in Cardassian space

147
00:08:29,893 --> 00:08:31,453
by the Klingon invasion.

148
00:08:31,497 --> 00:08:32,659
Ah.

149
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,671
Until he heard rumors
about an Orb

150
00:08:34,705 --> 00:08:37,507
capable of taking him
back in time.

151
00:08:37,545 --> 00:08:38,980
So, what is he planning to do?

152
00:08:39,015 --> 00:08:43,014
Contact his younger self
and warn himself about Kirk?

153
00:08:43,057 --> 00:08:45,621
He could be planning
to kill Kirk.

154
00:08:45,664 --> 00:08:46,860
The bottom line is

155
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,598
we have to find Darvin
and stop him

156
00:08:48,638 --> 00:08:51,109
before he has a chance
to alter history.

157
00:08:51,144 --> 00:08:53,708
Do we know where he beamed to?

158
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:57,088
No. He wiped the transporter
logs when he beamed out.

159
00:08:57,125 --> 00:09:00,121
So, he could be on
the <i>Enterprise</i> or the station.

160
00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:03,172
We'll have to search both
without raising suspicion

161
00:09:03,206 --> 00:09:05,302
or altering
the timeline ourselves.

162
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:07,075
The last thing I want

163
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:10,213
is a visit from Temporal
Investigations when we get home.

164
00:09:10,256 --> 00:09:14,460
I suppose we ought
to find a way to blend in.

165
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:35,305
Captain.

166
00:09:35,349 --> 00:09:37,286
Well... Lieutenant, actually.

167
00:09:37,321 --> 00:09:39,690
I didn't want to push my luck.

168
00:09:39,726 --> 00:09:41,560
Looks good on you, sir.

169
00:09:43,302 --> 00:09:44,737
Thank you, Ensign.

170
00:09:44,773 --> 00:09:45,741
Wait a minute.

171
00:09:45,775 --> 00:09:47,404
Aren't you two
wearing the wrong color?

172
00:09:47,445 --> 00:09:49,575
Don't you know anything
about this period in time?

173
00:09:49,617 --> 00:09:52,088
I'm a doctor,
not an historian.

174
00:09:52,123 --> 00:09:54,960
In the old days,
Operations officers wore red.

175
00:09:54,997 --> 00:09:57,195
Command officers wore gold.

176
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:59,103
And women wore less.

177
00:10:02,381 --> 00:10:05,047
I think I'm going
to like history.

178
00:10:05,088 --> 00:10:07,754
The original <i>Enterprise</i>
used an old-style

179
00:10:07,794 --> 00:10:09,161
duotronic sensor array.

180
00:10:09,198 --> 00:10:10,963
If we wait for just
the right point

181
00:10:11,002 --> 00:10:13,702
in the scan cycle,
we can de-cloak the <i>Defiant</i>

182
00:10:13,742 --> 00:10:15,940
for almost three seconds
without being detected.

183
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,247
Is that enough time
to transport us aboard?

184
00:10:18,352 --> 00:10:19,411
Barely.

185
00:10:19,455 --> 00:10:21,255
Chief, here are the coordinates.

186
00:10:21,327 --> 00:10:23,127
The Captain and I
will start on Deck Four

187
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,258
and work our way aft.

188
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:26,395
You and Julian
should start on Deck 21...

189
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:28,637
And work our way forward.

190
00:10:28,677 --> 00:10:30,169
What about the station?

191
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:32,708
Little of it is habitable.

192
00:10:32,754 --> 00:10:35,283
Most of K-7 consists
of storage areas

193
00:10:35,326 --> 00:10:37,422
and industrial
fabrication facilities.

194
00:10:37,465 --> 00:10:38,764
It shouldn't take
long to search.

195
00:10:38,802 --> 00:10:41,273
Security isn't as tight
as it is on a starship.

196
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,974
Remember...
try to avoid contact

197
00:10:44,014 --> 00:10:45,483
with people of this time period.

198
00:10:45,517 --> 00:10:47,750
We're coming up on a band shift
in the scan cycle.

199
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:48,780
Dax.

200
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:39,547
Ready?

201
00:11:39,581 --> 00:11:40,914
Deck 21.

202
00:11:43,257 --> 00:11:44,726
Deck 21.

203
00:11:46,932 --> 00:11:48,561
I said, Deck 21.

204
00:11:48,603 --> 00:11:50,437
Maybe if you said, "Please."

205
00:11:50,474 --> 00:11:52,171
What's wrong with this thing?

206
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,442
Don't ask me.

207
00:11:53,481 --> 00:11:56,113
I don't know anything
about this time period.

208
00:11:56,154 --> 00:11:57,179
Maybe it's jammed.

209
00:11:57,224 --> 00:11:59,559
Take that panel off the wall.

210
00:12:05,577 --> 00:12:06,910
Deck 15.

211
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,589
I won't tell anyone
if you don't.

212
00:12:21,081 --> 00:12:23,849
They really packed them in
on these old ships.

213
00:12:23,888 --> 00:12:25,255
What about over there?

214
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,419
Perfect.

215
00:12:26,461 --> 00:12:28,659
An auxiliary
communications juncture.

216
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:30,328
I'll pretend to do repairs.

217
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,930
You scan for Darvin.

218
00:12:33,845 --> 00:12:36,647
I used to have one of these.

219
00:12:36,685 --> 00:12:41,060
Hmm. I love classic
23rd-century design.

220
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:42,223
Black finish...

221
00:12:42,265 --> 00:12:43,632
silver highlights.

222
00:12:43,669 --> 00:12:45,002
Dax...

223
00:12:46,341 --> 00:12:47,867
Sorry.

224
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:31,507
I don't want
any more Spican flame gems.

225
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,387
Thanks to you I already have
enough Spican flame gems

226
00:13:34,424 --> 00:13:35,392
to last me a lifetime.

227
00:13:35,426 --> 00:13:36,554
How sad for you, my friend.

228
00:13:36,595 --> 00:13:39,227
You won't find
a finer stone anywhere...

229
00:13:39,268 --> 00:13:40,293
What's your pleasure?

230
00:13:42,476 --> 00:13:45,712
Uh, I'll have a <i>raktajino.</i>

231
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,344
You're the second person
today who ordered that.

232
00:13:47,388 --> 00:13:48,356
What is it?

233
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,518
Klingon coffee.

234
00:13:50,562 --> 00:13:52,054
The second person?

235
00:13:52,099 --> 00:13:53,124
Who was the first?

236
00:13:53,168 --> 00:13:55,162
An older man... a human.

237
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,834
Where is he now?

238
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:57,936
I don't know.

239
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,643
He left about an hour ago.

240
00:13:59,684 --> 00:14:01,518
I think he said he'd be back.

241
00:14:01,555 --> 00:14:04,996
We don't have
any Klingon beverages.

242
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:07,000
Would you like something else?

243
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,639
Um...

244
00:14:10,676 --> 00:14:11,644
Tarkalean tea.

245
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:12,978
Okay.

246
00:14:13,016 --> 00:14:14,987
You're a difficult man to reach

247
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,148
but I have something

248
00:14:16,257 --> 00:14:18,353
from the far reaches
of the galaxy.

249
00:14:18,395 --> 00:14:19,363
Surely you want...

250
00:14:19,397 --> 00:14:20,365
Not at your price.

251
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,701
Ooh, what is it?

252
00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:24,470
Is it alive?

253
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,344
May I hold it?

254
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:31,755
Oh, it's adorable.

255
00:14:31,794 --> 00:14:33,628
What is it?

256
00:14:42,252 --> 00:14:44,723
Chief, you're supposed
to be working.

257
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,229
I'm afraid to touch anything.

258
00:14:47,297 --> 00:14:50,134
It's all cross-circuited
and patched together.

259
00:14:50,171 --> 00:14:52,074
I can't make
head nor tails of it.

260
00:14:52,109 --> 00:14:53,943
Sounds like one
of your repair jobs.

261
00:14:55,217 --> 00:14:57,951
Well, there's no sign
of Darvin in this section.

262
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:01,260
I'm going to have
to widen the scan radius.

263
00:15:01,365 --> 00:15:03,632
If I can figure out how.

264
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:07,133
Well, keep the scan field
below 20 milliwatts.

265
00:15:07,178 --> 00:15:08,909
Otherwise, you'll set off
the internal sensors.

266
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,078
Thank you, Chief.

267
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:11,588
I was listening during
the mission briefing.

268
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:13,821
What are you two doing here?

269
00:15:15,365 --> 00:15:16,994
Scotty told me to do this.

270
00:15:18,004 --> 00:15:20,875
Oh, you were
going to... do this?

271
00:15:20,911 --> 00:15:22,471
It's on the duty roster.

272
00:15:22,516 --> 00:15:25,250
Must have been...
some mix-up.

273
00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:27,853
Isn't that a medical tricorder?

274
00:15:27,895 --> 00:15:30,025
Yes. Yes, it is.

275
00:15:30,067 --> 00:15:31,832
I'm a doctor.

276
00:15:31,871 --> 00:15:34,867
Why do we need a doctor
to repair a power relay?

277
00:15:34,912 --> 00:15:36,849
You don't...

278
00:15:36,883 --> 00:15:38,648
obviously.

279
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,851
No. I'm doing a study.

280
00:15:40,892 --> 00:15:44,298
It... has to do with...
work-related stress.

281
00:15:45,504 --> 00:15:47,133
Oh.

282
00:15:47,174 --> 00:15:49,042
Why don't you two, um, go on?

283
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:50,309
Pretend I'm not here.

284
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,683
So, where should we start?

285
00:15:52,721 --> 00:15:54,213
Well...

286
00:15:55,928 --> 00:15:57,659
obviously, the... first thing

287
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,171
we should do is
to take this, uh...

288
00:16:00,205 --> 00:16:02,176
this transtator here...

289
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,509
and...

290
00:16:06,554 --> 00:16:08,855
Leave it exactly where it is.

291
00:16:08,894 --> 00:16:10,831
The, uh...

292
00:16:10,864 --> 00:16:12,767
job pressure's
been getting to him.

293
00:16:12,803 --> 00:16:15,469
Why don't you take over?

294
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:16,671
All right, Ensign.

295
00:16:16,711 --> 00:16:18,545
I think I've seen enough.

296
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,417
Let's get you back to Sick Bay.

297
00:16:20,455 --> 00:16:21,617
Oh.

298
00:16:21,657 --> 00:16:23,560
Oh, uh, I'd appreciate it

299
00:16:23,595 --> 00:16:26,568
if you wouldn't
mention this to anyone.

300
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:27,832
No problem.

301
00:16:27,872 --> 00:16:29,740
Hope you feel better.

302
00:16:42,908 --> 00:16:46,075
I have completed my search
of the Primary Habitat Level...

303
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,682
What is that sound?

304
00:16:48,722 --> 00:16:50,955
Soothing, isn't it?

305
00:16:50,994 --> 00:16:52,327
The bartender called it...

306
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,662
A tribble.

307
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:04,860
Sit down.

308
00:17:04,969 --> 00:17:06,438
You're drawing attention.

309
00:17:12,721 --> 00:17:16,423
Where did you get that...
thing?

310
00:17:16,463 --> 00:17:19,061
From a man named Cyrano Jones.

311
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,903
He told me tribbles
like everyone

312
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:23,104
but this one doesn't
seem to like you.

313
00:17:23,145 --> 00:17:24,637
The feeling's!

314
00:17:24,683 --> 00:17:26,312
The feeling's mutual.

315
00:17:26,354 --> 00:17:28,450
They are detestable creatures.

316
00:17:28,492 --> 00:17:30,895
Hmm. Interesting.

317
00:17:30,931 --> 00:17:32,366
It's been my observation

318
00:17:32,401 --> 00:17:36,172
that most humanoids
love soft, furry animals

319
00:17:36,211 --> 00:17:39,184
especially if they make
pleasing sounds.

320
00:17:39,218 --> 00:17:42,419
They do nothing
but consume food and breed.

321
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,759
If you feed that thing
more than the smallest morsel

322
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:46,769
in a few hours,
you'll have ten tribbles

323
00:17:46,802 --> 00:17:47,964
then a hundred,
then a thousand.

324
00:17:48,005 --> 00:17:49,064
Calm down.

325
00:17:49,108 --> 00:17:50,338
They were once considered

326
00:17:50,377 --> 00:17:52,142
mortal enemies
of the Klingon Empire.

327
00:17:52,182 --> 00:17:53,845
This?

328
00:17:54,688 --> 00:17:58,254
A mortal enemy of the Empire?

329
00:17:58,297 --> 00:18:02,672
They were an ecological menace,
a plague to be wiped out.

330
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,405
Wiped out?

331
00:18:04,445 --> 00:18:06,142
What are you saying?

332
00:18:06,183 --> 00:18:08,849
Hundreds of warriors
were sent to track them down

333
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:10,517
throughout the galaxy.

334
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,158
An armada obliterated
the tribble homeworld.

335
00:18:13,199 --> 00:18:16,867
By the end of the 23rd century,
they had been eradicated.

336
00:18:16,908 --> 00:18:20,212
Hmm. Another glorious chapter
of Klingon history.

337
00:18:20,249 --> 00:18:22,379
Tell me,
do they still sing songs

338
00:18:22,421 --> 00:18:24,152
of the great tribble hunt?

339
00:18:33,948 --> 00:18:35,748
What should we do?

340
00:18:35,787 --> 00:18:37,621
Get to battle stations.

341
00:18:48,984 --> 00:18:50,647
Deck Seven.

342
00:18:51,992 --> 00:18:54,726
Let's see if we can
find out what's going on.

343
00:18:54,765 --> 00:18:56,428
Sisko to <i>Defiant.</i>

344
00:19:01,615 --> 00:19:03,244
Sisko to <i>Defiant.</i>

345
00:19:03,285 --> 00:19:04,754
<i>Defiant</i> here.

346
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:06,383
Report.

347
00:19:06,427 --> 00:19:08,591
A Klingon D7 battle cruiser
just dropped out of warp.

348
00:19:08,632 --> 00:19:09,862
It's approaching the station.

349
00:19:09,902 --> 00:19:11,337
Have they locked weapons?

350
00:19:13,343 --> 00:19:14,471
Not yet.

351
00:19:14,513 --> 00:19:16,916
Kira, can you identify
the Klingon vessel?

352
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:21,988
The IKS <i>Gr'oth.</i>

353
00:19:22,031 --> 00:19:23,500
That's Koloth's ship.

354
00:19:23,535 --> 00:19:24,799
Curzon's old friend?

355
00:19:24,837 --> 00:19:27,469
Yes, and he isn't
going to attack.

356
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:31,349
I remember Koloth telling me
he once traded insults with Kirk

357
00:19:31,387 --> 00:19:34,326
on a space station
near the Federation border.

358
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,422
He always regretted
never getting the chance

359
00:19:36,465 --> 00:19:37,524
to face him in battle.

360
00:19:37,568 --> 00:19:40,097
The Klingon ship
just transported two people

361
00:19:40,141 --> 00:19:42,510
to the Station Manager's office,
Captain.

362
00:19:42,546 --> 00:19:44,483
That's Koloth.

363
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:46,887
Maybe we should beam over
to the station

364
00:19:46,923 --> 00:19:48,222
to help Odo and Worf.

365
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,390
We know Darvin was there
a few hours ago.

366
00:19:50,432 --> 00:19:51,799
I think it might be better

367
00:19:51,835 --> 00:19:54,136
if Chief O'Brien
and Dr. Bashir go.

368
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:58,115
But if we went,
we might run into Koloth.

369
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,244
Exactly.

370
00:19:59,287 --> 00:20:02,728
It's not as if he
would recognize me.

371
00:20:02,762 --> 00:20:04,824
I'd love to see him
at his prime.

372
00:20:04,866 --> 00:20:06,301
Dax.

373
00:20:06,337 --> 00:20:09,401
Major, beam the Chief
and the Doctor to K-7

374
00:20:09,444 --> 00:20:11,107
and fill them in.

375
00:20:11,148 --> 00:20:12,617
Aye, sir.

376
00:20:14,623 --> 00:20:16,457
It would have been fun.

377
00:20:16,495 --> 00:20:18,557
Too much fun.

378
00:20:19,902 --> 00:20:22,339
Dax was right
about the Klingons.

379
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,710
They were only interested
in shore leave

380
00:20:24,747 --> 00:20:26,216
and Captain Kirk allowed them

381
00:20:26,251 --> 00:20:28,917
to beam aboard the station
in small groups.

382
00:20:28,957 --> 00:20:31,190
When the <i>Enterprise</i> stood down
from Red Alert

383
00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:34,327
we all resumed our search
for Darvin.

384
00:20:34,371 --> 00:20:35,840
The next band shift

385
00:20:35,874 --> 00:20:38,403
in the <i>Enterprise</i> scan cycle
will be in three minutes.

386
00:20:38,447 --> 00:20:40,782
We'll be ready, Major.
O'Brien out.

387
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,585
We should find a turbolift.

388
00:20:53,684 --> 00:20:54,846
Hello again.

389
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:56,754
Hello.

390
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:02,334
Deck Ten.

391
00:21:06,347 --> 00:21:08,318
Your flap's open.

392
00:21:09,855 --> 00:21:11,381
Excuse me?

393
00:21:11,426 --> 00:21:13,990
On your tricorder.

394
00:21:14,032 --> 00:21:15,661
You're draining power.

395
00:21:15,702 --> 00:21:16,966
Oh...

396
00:21:17,006 --> 00:21:18,270
thank you.

397
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,974
He's always doing that.

398
00:21:22,018 --> 00:21:23,282
You're a doctor?

399
00:21:23,321 --> 00:21:24,483
Yes.

400
00:21:24,524 --> 00:21:25,925
I just transferred here

401
00:21:25,961 --> 00:21:27,795
from the <i>Lexington</i> last week.

402
00:21:27,832 --> 00:21:29,962
Welcome aboard.

403
00:21:31,508 --> 00:21:33,843
I'm coming into Sick Bay
tomorrow for my physical.

404
00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:40,888
1500.

405
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,764
Lieutenant Watley.

406
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:50,252
You realize, of course,
she was just using you

407
00:21:50,286 --> 00:21:51,755
to get to me?

408
00:21:51,789 --> 00:21:53,589
Watley...

409
00:21:53,628 --> 00:21:56,362
that was my great-
grandmother's name.

410
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,596
Funny.

411
00:21:57,637 --> 00:21:59,767
And I think she
was in Starfleet.

412
00:21:59,808 --> 00:22:01,038
Well, it's a common enough name.

413
00:22:01,078 --> 00:22:02,843
But if that was her?

414
00:22:02,882 --> 00:22:04,785
Do you realize the odds?

415
00:22:06,057 --> 00:22:08,426
No one ever met
my great-grandfather.

416
00:22:08,462 --> 00:22:11,435
This could be
a predestination paradox.

417
00:22:11,469 --> 00:22:12,437
Come on, Chief.

418
00:22:12,472 --> 00:22:13,702
Surely you took elementary

419
00:22:13,742 --> 00:22:15,439
temporal mechanics
at the Academy.

420
00:22:15,479 --> 00:22:18,043
I could be destined
to fall in love with that woman

421
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:22,860
and become
my own great-grandfather.

422
00:22:22,897 --> 00:22:24,196
You're being ridiculous.

423
00:22:24,233 --> 00:22:25,361
Ridiculous?

424
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,634
If I don't meet with her
tomorrow, I may never be born!

425
00:22:27,675 --> 00:22:30,078
Chief, are you ready
for transport?

426
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:31,083
Are we ever.

427
00:22:31,117 --> 00:22:32,245
Stand by.

428
00:22:32,287 --> 00:22:34,281
You saw the way
she looked at me.

429
00:22:34,324 --> 00:22:36,124
You can't just dismiss this.

430
00:22:36,162 --> 00:22:37,221
I can try.

431
00:22:37,265 --> 00:22:38,757
All right.

432
00:22:39,938 --> 00:22:41,339
Fine

433
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:42,844
but I can't wait to get
back to Deep Space 9

434
00:22:42,878 --> 00:22:44,040
and see your face
when you find out

435
00:22:44,081 --> 00:22:45,744
that I never existed.

436
00:22:51,733 --> 00:22:52,679
Dax and I resumed our search
for Darvin.

437
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:57,019
Dax and I resumed our search
for Darvin.

438
00:22:57,056 --> 00:22:59,391
Benjamin, look.

439
00:23:04,073 --> 00:23:06,408
Bridge to Captain Kirk.

440
00:23:08,751 --> 00:23:10,050
Kirk here.

441
00:23:10,087 --> 00:23:11,055
Mr. Baris is waiting

442
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,719
on Channel E
to speak to you, sir.

443
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,750
Keep working.

444
00:23:13,797 --> 00:23:15,323
We're a maintenance crew
just doing our job.

445
00:23:15,367 --> 00:23:17,338
Mr. Baris is coming on.

446
00:23:17,372 --> 00:23:19,035
Yes, Mr. Baris,
what can I do for you?

447
00:23:19,075 --> 00:23:21,912
Kirk, this station
is swarming with Klingons.

448
00:23:21,949 --> 00:23:23,749
I was not aware, Mr. Baris

449
00:23:23,787 --> 00:23:26,190
that 12 Klingons
constitutes a swarm.

450
00:23:26,259 --> 00:23:27,694
Captain Kirk, I consider

451
00:23:27,729 --> 00:23:29,757
your security measures
a disgrace.

452
00:23:29,801 --> 00:23:32,433
In my opinion,
you have taken this entire...

453
00:23:32,474 --> 00:23:33,909
I had no idea.

454
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:35,209
What?

455
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:38,653
He's so much more
handsome in person.

456
00:23:38,689 --> 00:23:39,988
Those eyes.

457
00:23:40,025 --> 00:23:43,659
Kirk had quite the reputation
as a ladies' man.

458
00:23:43,701 --> 00:23:46,674
Not him... Spock.

459
00:23:46,709 --> 00:23:49,511
...free and complete access
to this station

460
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:51,918
for that man who just
walked out of here...

461
00:23:51,954 --> 00:23:53,116
Let's go.

462
00:23:53,157 --> 00:23:56,096
Mr. Baris, I have guards
around the grain.

463
00:23:56,131 --> 00:23:58,568
I have guards around
the Klingons.

464
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,072
I can't believe
you don't at least

465
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:01,633
want to meet Captain Kirk?

466
00:24:01,678 --> 00:24:02,977
That's the last thing
on my mind.

467
00:24:03,014 --> 00:24:06,352
Oh, come on, Benjamin,
are you telling me

468
00:24:06,389 --> 00:24:08,724
you're not the tiniest
bit interested in meeting

469
00:24:08,761 --> 00:24:11,325
one of the most famous
men in Starfleet history?

470
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:12,631
We have a job to do.

471
00:24:12,671 --> 00:24:15,644
But it's... it's James Kirk.

472
00:24:15,678 --> 00:24:17,774
Look, of course,
I want to meet him.

473
00:24:17,816 --> 00:24:21,348
I'd like to shake his hand,
ask him about...

474
00:24:21,391 --> 00:24:23,385
fighting the Gorn on Cestus III.

475
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:25,264
But that's not why we're here,
old man.

476
00:24:26,972 --> 00:24:28,271
You're right.

477
00:24:28,308 --> 00:24:30,541
I guess the difference
between you and me is

478
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,049
I remember this time.

479
00:24:32,084 --> 00:24:34,487
I lived in this time,
and it's...

480
00:24:34,522 --> 00:24:37,654
it's hard to not want
to be a part of it again.

481
00:24:54,671 --> 00:24:56,197
Clearly, we've been
going about

482
00:24:56,242 --> 00:24:58,145
this search business
all wrong, Chief.

483
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,513
You're right.

484
00:24:59,549 --> 00:25:00,517
Why bother searching

485
00:25:00,552 --> 00:25:02,420
30 decks when you can
just plunk yourself down

486
00:25:02,456 --> 00:25:03,948
at the bar here
and wait for Darvin

487
00:25:03,994 --> 00:25:05,293
to come to you?

488
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:08,771
We have reason to believe
that he'll return to this area.

489
00:25:08,805 --> 00:25:11,903
Ah, yes, the <i>raktajino.</i>

490
00:25:11,946 --> 00:25:14,748
A vital clue that others
might have missed.

491
00:25:14,786 --> 00:25:15,880
How fortunate it is

492
00:25:15,922 --> 00:25:17,790
that it has kept you
stuck at this bar

493
00:25:17,827 --> 00:25:21,268
for the past three
hours having drinks

494
00:25:21,302 --> 00:25:23,934
while we've been crawling
through conduits.

495
00:25:26,581 --> 00:25:28,210
My God, that's him.

496
00:25:28,252 --> 00:25:29,277
Who?

497
00:25:29,321 --> 00:25:30,346
Kirk.

498
00:25:30,424 --> 00:25:31,357
Where?

499
00:25:31,426 --> 00:25:32,759
The one on the left

500
00:25:32,796 --> 00:25:34,493
in the gold,
just sitting down.

501
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,401
That's Kirk?

502
00:25:40,046 --> 00:25:41,914
It would be an honor
to meet him.

503
00:25:41,951 --> 00:25:43,854
Let's buy him a drink.

504
00:25:43,889 --> 00:25:45,051
Gentlemen...

505
00:25:45,092 --> 00:25:48,259
no one is buying anyone a drink.

506
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,963
He's right.

507
00:25:50,004 --> 00:25:53,501
We can't risk altering
the timeline.

508
00:25:57,054 --> 00:25:58,421
What'll it be, boys?

509
00:25:58,491 --> 00:25:59,755
And don't ask for <i>raktajino.</i>

510
00:25:59,794 --> 00:26:01,423
If I have to say we don't
carry that one more...

511
00:26:01,464 --> 00:26:02,432
Who ordered a <i>raktajino?</i>

512
00:26:02,466 --> 00:26:04,197
The Klingons.

513
00:26:04,238 --> 00:26:05,537
Klingons?

514
00:26:05,575 --> 00:26:07,169
Over there.

515
00:26:07,212 --> 00:26:09,445
And over there.

516
00:26:10,853 --> 00:26:12,322
Those are Klingons?

517
00:26:12,357 --> 00:26:15,729
All right, you boys
have had enough.

518
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:23,707
Mr. Worf?

519
00:26:26,758 --> 00:26:31,532
They are Klingons,
and it is a long story.

520
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:32,732
What happened?

521
00:26:32,773 --> 00:26:34,607
Some kind
of genetic engineering?

522
00:26:34,644 --> 00:26:36,273
A viral mutation?

523
00:26:36,315 --> 00:26:39,186
We do not discuss it
with outsiders.

524
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:42,685
Take it easy, lad.

525
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:45,703
Everybody's entitled
to an opinion.

526
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:47,434
That's right

527
00:26:47,474 --> 00:26:49,034
and if I think

528
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:54,023
that Kirk is a Denebian
slime devil

529
00:26:54,058 --> 00:26:56,895
well, that's my opinion, too.

530
00:26:56,931 --> 00:26:59,334
Don't do it, mister,
and that's an order.

531
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:01,739
But you heard what he called
the Captain.

532
00:27:01,775 --> 00:27:03,678
Look at the way Kirk
is ignoring that Klingon.

533
00:27:03,714 --> 00:27:05,617
He's letting
his security officer handle it.

534
00:27:05,652 --> 00:27:07,748
Chief, are you sure
that's Kirk?

535
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:08,849
Absolutely.

536
00:27:08,892 --> 00:27:09,882
Why is he wearing

537
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:11,023
Lieutenant's stripes?

538
00:27:11,064 --> 00:27:12,590
...saggy, old rust...

539
00:27:12,634 --> 00:27:14,399
I think we've got
bigger problems

540
00:27:14,439 --> 00:27:16,204
than a case
of mistaken identity.

541
00:27:16,244 --> 00:27:17,474
...garbage scow.

542
00:27:17,513 --> 00:27:19,780
Half the Quadrant knows it.

543
00:27:19,819 --> 00:27:22,951
That's why they're learning
to speak Klingonese.

544
00:27:25,198 --> 00:27:26,599
Mr. Scott.

545
00:27:28,038 --> 00:27:30,168
Laddie...

546
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:34,175
don't you think you should...
rephrase that?

547
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,088
You're right.

548
00:27:36,124 --> 00:27:37,924
I should.

549
00:27:37,962 --> 00:27:39,329
I didn't mean to say

550
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:42,829
that the <i>Enterprise</i>
should be hauling garbage.

551
00:27:42,874 --> 00:27:48,548
I meant to say that it should
be hauled away as garbage.

552
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:05,926
What are you doing?

553
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:22,676
It's Darvin!

554
00:29:51,153 --> 00:29:52,953
Your men could've avoided
that fight, Captain.

555
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:56,432
Regulation 157,
Section Three, Paragraph 18:

556
00:29:56,466 --> 00:30:00,066
"Starfleet officers shall take
all necessary precautions

557
00:30:00,108 --> 00:30:02,306
"to minimize any participation

558
00:30:02,346 --> 00:30:04,579
in historical events."

559
00:30:05,788 --> 00:30:07,314
All right.

560
00:30:07,358 --> 00:30:08,725
It was a mistake.

561
00:30:08,762 --> 00:30:11,199
But there were
no lasting repercussions.

562
00:30:11,234 --> 00:30:12,464
How do you know that?

563
00:30:12,504 --> 00:30:14,064
For all we know,
we could be living

564
00:30:14,107 --> 00:30:15,736
in an alternate timeline
right now.

565
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:18,581
If my people had caused
any changes in the timeline

566
00:30:18,619 --> 00:30:22,116
we would've been the first
to notice when we got back.

567
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,894
Why do they all
have to say that?

568
00:30:24,933 --> 00:30:26,266
So...

569
00:30:26,303 --> 00:30:29,105
your men were arrested...

570
00:30:29,143 --> 00:30:32,310
That's right, but instead
of being taken to the brig

571
00:30:32,352 --> 00:30:36,123
they were brought
in for questioning.

572
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,595
I want to know who started it.

573
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:39,761
I'm waiting.

574
00:30:42,242 --> 00:30:43,404
Who started the fight?

575
00:30:43,511 --> 00:30:44,342
I don't know, sir.

576
00:30:45,449 --> 00:30:48,013
All right.

577
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:49,993
Chekov...

578
00:30:50,027 --> 00:30:50,995
I know you.

579
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,363
You started it, didn't you?

580
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,733
No, sir.
I didn't.

581
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:54,829
Well, who did?

582
00:30:54,872 --> 00:30:56,239
I don't know, sir.

583
00:30:56,275 --> 00:31:00,114
"I don't know, sir."

584
00:31:00,152 --> 00:31:03,216
I want to know
who threw the first punch.

585
00:31:03,259 --> 00:31:05,628
All right, you're all
confined to quarters

586
00:31:05,664 --> 00:31:07,498
until I find out who started it.

587
00:31:07,536 --> 00:31:09,028
Dismissed.

588
00:31:14,285 --> 00:31:16,620
That was close.

589
00:31:16,658 --> 00:31:19,358
Me... of all the people
in the lineup

590
00:31:19,397 --> 00:31:21,391
he asks me who threw
the first punch.

591
00:31:21,435 --> 00:31:23,269
And you lied to him.

592
00:31:23,307 --> 00:31:24,742
I lied to Captain Kirk.

593
00:31:24,777 --> 00:31:26,440
I wish Keiko could've
been here to see it.

594
00:31:30,424 --> 00:31:32,793
I'm sorry about that,
little fellow.

595
00:31:32,829 --> 00:31:36,270
Who left you out here all alone?

596
00:31:40,848 --> 00:31:42,842
He's not alone.

597
00:31:58,725 --> 00:32:01,493
Welcome back, Mr. Darvin.

598
00:32:01,531 --> 00:32:03,468
The pleasure is all mine.

599
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:05,565
Worf...

600
00:32:05,608 --> 00:32:07,476
hold on.

601
00:32:07,513 --> 00:32:10,213
I hope you realize
you'll be facing

602
00:32:10,253 --> 00:32:14,195
some very serious charges
when we get back.

603
00:32:15,699 --> 00:32:16,827
You wouldn't dare

604
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:19,671
put one of the greatest heroes
of the Klingon Empire

605
00:32:19,709 --> 00:32:21,474
into the brig.

606
00:32:21,513 --> 00:32:24,486
You are no hero to the Empire.

607
00:32:24,521 --> 00:32:26,150
I will be.

608
00:32:26,191 --> 00:32:28,059
I've been thinking
about my statue

609
00:32:28,096 --> 00:32:29,326
in the Hall of Warriors.

610
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:32,338
I want it to capture
my essence.

611
00:32:32,373 --> 00:32:35,278
Our statues can be so...

612
00:32:35,313 --> 00:32:37,375
generic sometimes,
don't you think?

613
00:32:37,418 --> 00:32:38,512
I take it
whatever your plan is

614
00:32:38,554 --> 00:32:41,493
you've already
set it in motion.

615
00:32:41,527 --> 00:32:44,933
I see myself standing
with Kirk's head in one hand...

616
00:32:47,241 --> 00:32:49,941
and a tribble in the other.

617
00:32:51,284 --> 00:32:52,446
What have you done?

618
00:32:52,487 --> 00:32:55,119
Did you hire someone
to kill him?

619
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,925
Did you sabotage the <i>Enterprise?</i>

620
00:32:56,965 --> 00:32:59,368
Nothing so mundane.

621
00:32:59,403 --> 00:33:01,806
Let's just say that Kirk's death

622
00:33:01,843 --> 00:33:04,816
will have a certain
poetic justice to it.

623
00:33:08,692 --> 00:33:10,560
He put a bomb in a tribble?

624
00:33:10,631 --> 00:33:12,225
It's his revenge.

625
00:33:12,268 --> 00:33:15,173
Originally, Kirk saw
how a tribble reacted

626
00:33:15,208 --> 00:33:17,509
to Darvin and realized
that he was a Klingon.

627
00:33:17,547 --> 00:33:19,541
He wouldn't say
where this tribble was

628
00:33:19,586 --> 00:33:23,357
but he did say that it was set
to go off within the hour.

629
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:26,598
It could be anywhere.

630
00:33:26,702 --> 00:33:29,105
Benjamin, I think we should risk
going to the Bridge.

631
00:33:29,142 --> 00:33:30,611
If we can use
the internal sensors

632
00:33:30,712 --> 00:33:33,446
we can scan the entire ship
for explosives

633
00:33:33,485 --> 00:33:35,513
in a matter of seconds.

634
00:33:35,557 --> 00:33:38,291
Dax and I will take care
of the <i>Enterprise.</i>

635
00:33:38,331 --> 00:33:40,895
The rest of you beam over to K-7
and start searching there.

636
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,530
Understood.

637
00:33:42,574 --> 00:33:46,641
But I think Mr. Worf
should remain here.

638
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:51,990
It seems he's... allergic
to tribbles.

639
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:52,998
All right.

640
00:33:53,032 --> 00:33:54,296
Captain

641
00:33:54,335 --> 00:33:57,571
I'm not sure we can get
to K-7's internal sensors.

642
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:59,204
Then you will have
to manually scan

643
00:33:59,247 --> 00:34:00,580
every tribble on the station.

644
00:34:00,617 --> 00:34:02,645
There must be thousands
of them by now.

645
00:34:02,689 --> 00:34:03,851
Hundreds of thousands.

646
00:34:03,891 --> 00:34:08,027
1,771,561.

647
00:34:08,068 --> 00:34:10,836
That's starting with one tribble
with an average litter of ten

648
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:12,310
every 12 hours.

649
00:34:12,345 --> 00:34:13,335
After three days...

650
00:34:13,381 --> 00:34:14,371
Thank you.

651
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:18,479
You have your orders, people.
Sisko out.

652
00:34:59,878 --> 00:35:02,213
Dr. McCoy, would you mind
coming up to the Bridge?

653
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:22,294
I rerouted
the sensor interface.

654
00:35:23,935 --> 00:35:25,564
It worked.

655
00:35:25,606 --> 00:35:27,804
I'm scanning the Bridge.

656
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,744
Nothing up here.

657
00:35:31,787 --> 00:35:33,758
That's a relief.

658
00:35:33,792 --> 00:35:37,028
When Kirk sat on that tribble,
I half expected it to go off.

659
00:35:38,838 --> 00:35:41,241
Nothing on the first six decks.

660
00:35:43,483 --> 00:35:45,716
Did you want to see me, Jim?

661
00:35:48,327 --> 00:35:49,386
Well, don't look at me.

662
00:35:49,497 --> 00:35:50,932
It's the tribbles
who are breeding.

663
00:35:50,967 --> 00:35:52,801
I know him.

664
00:35:52,838 --> 00:35:55,402
That must be McCoy,
the ship's doctor.

665
00:35:55,511 --> 00:36:00,889
McCoy...
McCoy...

666
00:36:00,924 --> 00:36:02,655
Well, the nearest thing
I can figure out

667
00:36:02,695 --> 00:36:04,164
is that they're born pregnant...

668
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:06,967
which seems to be
quite a time saver.

669
00:36:07,006 --> 00:36:09,706
Leonard McCoy.

670
00:36:09,745 --> 00:36:12,377
I met him when he was
a student at OI' Miss.

671
00:36:12,485 --> 00:36:13,818
Who met him... Curzon?

672
00:36:13,855 --> 00:36:14,823
No.

673
00:36:14,858 --> 00:36:16,795
My host at the time was Emony.

674
00:36:16,829 --> 00:36:19,996
She was on Earth judging
a gymnastics competition.

675
00:36:20,037 --> 00:36:22,440
I had a feeling
he'd become a doctor.

676
00:36:24,314 --> 00:36:27,116
He had the hands of a surgeon.

677
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,432
I've scanned every deck.

678
00:36:33,469 --> 00:36:35,872
The bomb's not aboard the ship.

679
00:36:35,908 --> 00:36:39,144
Then it must be somewhere
on K-7.

680
00:37:26,095 --> 00:37:27,655
Odo here.

681
00:37:27,698 --> 00:37:28,757
The bomb's

682
00:37:28,801 --> 00:37:30,498
not on the <i>Enterprise.</i>
It must be over there.

683
00:37:30,538 --> 00:37:32,406
We've only been able
to get through two decks.

684
00:37:32,443 --> 00:37:33,502
We're running out of time.

685
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,049
I can send more teams
from the <i>Defiant.</i>

686
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:37,054
It's not a question
of manpower.

687
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,184
It's a question
of multiplication.

688
00:37:39,226 --> 00:37:41,288
The tribbles are breeding so
fast we can't keep up with them.

689
00:37:41,331 --> 00:37:44,498
Benjamin, maybe we could
narrow things down a little.

690
00:37:44,539 --> 00:37:47,809
Presumably, Darvin put the bomb
somewhere he knows Kirk

691
00:37:47,847 --> 00:37:49,180
is going to be
in the next half an hour

692
00:37:49,216 --> 00:37:51,187
so if we stick close to Kirk...

693
00:37:51,221 --> 00:37:52,554
He might lead us right to it.

694
00:37:52,658 --> 00:37:54,856
It's worth a try,
but there's no reason

695
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:56,868
for us to stop searching
over here.

696
00:37:56,902 --> 00:37:58,839
Keep at it for now, Constable.

697
00:37:58,873 --> 00:38:01,140
Deck Five.

698
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,656
This is my chicken sandwich
and coffee.

699
00:38:21,695 --> 00:38:22,720
I want these things
off the ship.

700
00:38:22,763 --> 00:38:24,096
I don't care if it takes
every man we've got.

701
00:38:24,134 --> 00:38:25,124
I want them off the ship.

702
00:38:28,077 --> 00:38:30,071
Aye, they're into the machinery,
all right

703
00:38:30,115 --> 00:38:32,484
and they're probably
in all the other

704
00:38:32,521 --> 00:38:33,580
food processors, too.

705
00:38:33,624 --> 00:38:34,752
How?

706
00:38:34,792 --> 00:38:36,159
Probably through one
of the air vents.

707
00:38:36,196 --> 00:38:38,326
Captain, there are vents
of that type

708
00:38:38,368 --> 00:38:39,598
on the space station.

709
00:38:39,638 --> 00:38:41,472
And in the storage compartments.

710
00:38:41,509 --> 00:38:44,779
Storage compartments.
Storage compartments.

711
00:38:44,816 --> 00:38:46,787
...meet us near
the storage compartments.

712
00:38:46,821 --> 00:38:47,811
We're beaming down.

713
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:03,792
Most of these are dead.

714
00:39:03,829 --> 00:39:05,492
The grain's poisoned.

715
00:39:05,533 --> 00:39:08,097
I'm picking up a faint
tricobalt signature.

716
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:10,303
The bomb's under here somewhere.

717
00:39:14,388 --> 00:39:15,413
What's that?

718
00:39:15,457 --> 00:39:16,482
It's not working, sir.

719
00:39:16,526 --> 00:39:17,516
It seems to be stuck.

720
00:39:17,562 --> 00:39:18,826
Here, let me try.

721
00:39:21,204 --> 00:39:24,508
Someone's trying
to open the bay door.

722
00:39:50,106 --> 00:39:53,307
Benjamin, it's right
here in front of us.

723
00:40:11,658 --> 00:40:13,595
They seem to be gorged.

724
00:40:13,629 --> 00:40:14,619
Gorged?!

725
00:40:14,665 --> 00:40:15,895
On my grain?!

726
00:40:15,935 --> 00:40:18,999
Kirk, I am going
to hold you responsible!

727
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:21,411
Must be thousands of them.

728
00:40:21,448 --> 00:40:22,974
Hundreds of thousands.

729
00:40:23,018 --> 00:40:26,652
1,771,561.

730
00:40:26,694 --> 00:40:28,961
That's assuming one
tribble multiplying

731
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,064
with an average litter of ten
producing a new generation

732
00:40:32,107 --> 00:40:34,578
every 12 hours over
a period of three days.

733
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:37,346
I found it.

734
00:40:43,234 --> 00:40:44,362
Sisko to <i>Defiant.</i>

735
00:40:44,403 --> 00:40:45,393
Go ahead, Captain.

736
00:40:45,439 --> 00:40:46,601
I found the bomb.

737
00:40:46,642 --> 00:40:48,202
Lock on to my tricorder signal

738
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:49,681
and beam it into space.

739
00:40:49,716 --> 00:40:50,980
Acknowledged.

740
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:15,400
Kira to Sisko.

741
00:41:15,444 --> 00:41:16,811
It worked.

742
00:41:16,848 --> 00:41:18,317
And as Captain,
I want two things done.

743
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:19,684
First, find Cyrano Jones...

744
00:41:19,721 --> 00:41:20,883
and second...

745
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,057
close that door.

746
00:41:25,189 --> 00:41:28,960
After the bomb was detonated,
history continued uninterrupted.

747
00:41:28,999 --> 00:41:30,867
And thanks to the tribbles

748
00:41:30,903 --> 00:41:33,899
Kirk was able to uncover
the truth about Darvin.

749
00:41:37,018 --> 00:41:38,578
They don't like you, Mr. Darvin.

750
00:41:38,622 --> 00:41:39,590
I wonder why?

751
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:41,390
Bones?

752
00:41:47,944 --> 00:41:49,538
Jim, this man is a Klingon.

753
00:41:55,295 --> 00:41:57,927
By the time we returned
to the <i>Defiant</i>

754
00:41:57,968 --> 00:42:00,235
Major Kira had discovered
how to use the Orb

755
00:42:00,273 --> 00:42:03,337
to bring us back
to our own time.

756
00:42:03,381 --> 00:42:05,215
And that's when you
returned to the present?

757
00:42:05,285 --> 00:42:08,691
Well... not exactly.

758
00:42:10,465 --> 00:42:11,764
Before we left

759
00:42:11,802 --> 00:42:16,803
I realized there was one
last thing I had to do...

760
00:42:16,847 --> 00:42:18,784
something I'd been
thinking about

761
00:42:18,818 --> 00:42:21,848
ever since I saw that ship
on the viewscreen.

762
00:42:22,961 --> 00:42:24,521
Excuse me, Captain.

763
00:42:24,565 --> 00:42:26,729
Here's tomorrow's duty roster
for your approval.

764
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:29,264
Lieutenant, uh...
Lieutenant...

765
00:42:29,343 --> 00:42:31,074
Benjamin Sisko, sir.

766
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:33,143
I've been
on temporary assignment here.

767
00:42:33,185 --> 00:42:35,554
Before I leave,
I just want to say...

768
00:42:35,592 --> 00:42:38,565
it's been an honor
serving with you, sir.

769
00:42:41,372 --> 00:42:43,103
All right, Lieutenant,
carry on.

770
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,339
Thank you, sir.

771
00:42:48,221 --> 00:42:49,520
Now...

772
00:42:52,198 --> 00:42:54,796
if you want to put
a letter of reprimand

773
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:57,105
in my file for that,
then go ahead.

774
00:42:57,143 --> 00:42:59,205
We'll have to review the case

775
00:42:59,248 --> 00:43:00,842
before making
any recommendations.

776
00:43:00,885 --> 00:43:03,483
However, I don't think
there was any harm done.

777
00:43:04,829 --> 00:43:06,993
Probably would have done
the same thing myself.

778
00:43:12,848 --> 00:43:15,319
You'll be receiving our report
in about a month.

779
00:43:15,353 --> 00:43:18,087
But, based on what
you've told us

780
00:43:18,127 --> 00:43:19,995
I don't think you have
anything to worry about.

781
00:43:20,031 --> 00:43:21,500
I'm glad to hear it.

782
00:43:21,535 --> 00:43:22,503
Good-bye, Captain.

783
00:43:22,537 --> 00:43:24,200
Good-bye.

784
00:43:27,549 --> 00:43:29,747
Docking Port Seven.

785
00:43:34,166 --> 00:43:35,658
It went well?

786
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:38,770
Good.

787
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:42,615
The Constable wants to see us
on the Promenade.

788
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:44,453
Did you tell them?

789
00:43:45,993 --> 00:43:47,930
They didn't ask.

790
00:43:49,435 --> 00:43:52,135
I'm open to suggestions, people.

791
00:43:52,175 --> 00:43:54,943
We could build another station.
