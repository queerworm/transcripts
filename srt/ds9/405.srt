1
00:00:02,897 --> 00:00:04,092
Worf to Major Kira.

2
00:00:04,134 --> 00:00:06,731
This is Kira.

3
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:10,338
Major, you have an incoming
transmission from a...

4
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:12,146
Razka Karn.

5
00:00:12,185 --> 00:00:14,246
He claims to be an old friend.

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,459
Put him through.

7
00:00:22,241 --> 00:00:24,177
Razka... it's been awhile.

8
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:25,612
How's business?

9
00:00:25,648 --> 00:00:28,176
Oh, let's just say,
I miss the old days on Bajor.

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,955
Smuggling might not have been
the safest line of work

11
00:00:31,995 --> 00:00:34,728
but it was a lot more exciting
than selling scrap metal.

12
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:36,635
What's on your mind, Razka?

13
00:00:36,672 --> 00:00:40,009
I picked up a lead
on the <i>Ravinok.</i>

14
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:43,743
Like the last time?

15
00:00:43,787 --> 00:00:45,883
Last time, it was just a rumor.

16
00:00:45,926 --> 00:00:48,990
This time I've got evidence...
a fragment of metal.

17
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:51,698
Looks like it's part
of the forward sensor array.

18
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:54,906
Can you bring it
to Deep Space 9 for analysis?

19
00:00:54,946 --> 00:00:57,816
Sorry, I'm afraid I can't leave
the Badlands right now.

20
00:00:57,852 --> 00:00:59,378
Important business.

21
00:00:59,422 --> 00:01:01,119
You understand.

22
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:02,856
Tholians are after you again.

23
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:06,837
Let's just say it would be
better if you came to me.

24
00:01:09,177 --> 00:01:11,774
It's been six years.

25
00:01:11,816 --> 00:01:14,219
Even if you have found
a piece of the <i>Ravinok</i>

26
00:01:14,255 --> 00:01:15,884
it doesn't mean
there are any survivors.

27
00:01:15,925 --> 00:01:19,866
There's only one way
for you to find out.

28
00:01:19,901 --> 00:01:21,997
I'll be waiting.

29
00:03:22,297 --> 00:03:27,036
And item number 17,
Trelos Vren was arrested

30
00:03:27,075 --> 00:03:29,410
on the Promenade outside
of the Klingon restaurant.

31
00:03:29,447 --> 00:03:32,386
He's being held on four
counts of petty theft.

32
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:35,360
Trelos Vren... where have I
heard that name before?

33
00:03:35,393 --> 00:03:36,726
We arrested him once

34
00:03:36,763 --> 00:03:38,961
for attempting to break
into the Assay Office.

35
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:40,766
And now he's taken up
pick-pocketing?

36
00:03:40,806 --> 00:03:42,867
Mmm... without much success.

37
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,317
Still, I suppose you
should admire him

38
00:03:48,355 --> 00:03:50,883
for his persistence.

39
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:54,829
That was a joke.

40
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,809
I'm sorry, Odo.

41
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,817
I may have a lead
on the <i>Ravinok.</i>

42
00:04:02,854 --> 00:04:05,257
I know what you're going to say.

43
00:04:05,292 --> 00:04:07,057
It's been six years since
the <i>Ravinok</i> disappeared.

44
00:04:07,096 --> 00:04:08,963
Odds are,
everyone on board is dead.

45
00:04:09,068 --> 00:04:10,263
That all may be true

46
00:04:10,303 --> 00:04:12,797
but that is not
what I was going to say.

47
00:04:12,842 --> 00:04:15,575
I was going to say "good luck."

48
00:04:15,615 --> 00:04:17,916
Good luck?

49
00:04:17,953 --> 00:04:20,720
You had a friend aboard
the <i>Ravinok,</i> correct?

50
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,493
Lorit Akrem.

51
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:25,868
Which means it doesn't matter

52
00:04:25,905 --> 00:04:27,738
if I think
there are any survivors

53
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,642
of even if you think
there are any survivors.

54
00:04:29,679 --> 00:04:31,912
You're going to go
looking for that ship

55
00:04:31,951 --> 00:04:34,787
and all I can say
is "good luck."

56
00:04:34,823 --> 00:04:36,919
And I hope you find them.

57
00:04:44,645 --> 00:04:45,978
Come in.

58
00:04:47,084 --> 00:04:48,644
Captain.

59
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:49,883
You here to see me off?

60
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:52,827
I'm afraid not.

61
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,061
I'd like for you
to postpone your trip

62
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,159
for at least a day or two.

63
00:04:56,204 --> 00:04:57,172
What's wrong?

64
00:04:57,206 --> 00:04:58,732
Somehow the Cardassian
government

65
00:04:58,776 --> 00:05:01,646
got wind of your plan
to search for the <i>Ravinok.</i>

66
00:05:01,683 --> 00:05:05,020
They've asked permission
to send someone with you.

67
00:05:05,057 --> 00:05:06,549
And you said yes?

68
00:05:06,593 --> 00:05:08,826
I said I'd talk to you about it.

69
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,806
The <i>Ravinok</i> was
a Cardassian ship.

70
00:05:13,843 --> 00:05:16,474
Carrying Bajoran prisoners.

71
00:05:20,524 --> 00:05:23,257
No, I'm not stopping
anyone else from looking.

72
00:05:23,297 --> 00:05:25,734
I just don't see why
they have to come with me.

73
00:05:27,272 --> 00:05:28,673
The request came directly

74
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:31,476
from the leader
of the new civilian government.

75
00:05:32,618 --> 00:05:34,087
Nerys...

76
00:05:34,188 --> 00:05:36,989
I know this isn't
what you had in mind

77
00:05:37,027 --> 00:05:41,766
but Bajor and Cardassia
must learn to work together

78
00:05:41,805 --> 00:05:47,010
and that means cooperating
on missions like these.

79
00:05:50,657 --> 00:05:52,320
All right.

80
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:54,798
Just tell them
I'm not going to wait forever.

81
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,666
If their representative
isn't here

82
00:05:56,704 --> 00:05:58,537
within 52 hours,
I'm going alone.

83
00:06:04,721 --> 00:06:06,988
I'll be sure
they get the message.

84
00:06:15,311 --> 00:06:17,874
So, did you and Kasidy
have a nice time last night?

85
00:06:17,917 --> 00:06:21,015
Huh. I just wish she
wasn't leaving tomorrow.

86
00:06:21,057 --> 00:06:23,460
Sounds like the two of you
are getting serious.

87
00:06:23,496 --> 00:06:24,725
I don't know about that.

88
00:06:24,765 --> 00:06:26,792
I don't think Kasidy is
looking to get serious.

89
00:06:26,837 --> 00:06:27,805
Ben!

90
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,807
Kasidy!

91
00:06:28,841 --> 00:06:31,005
We were just talking about you.

92
00:06:31,046 --> 00:06:32,481
I don't mean to interrupt.

93
00:06:32,515 --> 00:06:33,642
I wanted you to know

94
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:36,156
that I won't be leaving
tomorrow after all.

95
00:06:36,191 --> 00:06:39,824
Ah, that's good news.
I mean, that's great.

96
00:06:39,865 --> 00:06:41,129
How long are you
going to be here?

97
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:42,136
Well, that depends

98
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,833
on whether I get
this new job or not.

99
00:06:43,874 --> 00:06:45,571
I've, uh, applied for a position

100
00:06:45,611 --> 00:06:47,638
with the Bajoran
Ministry of Commerce

101
00:06:47,683 --> 00:06:49,346
to captain
one of their freighters.

102
00:06:49,386 --> 00:06:51,185
You're going to work
for the Bajorans?

103
00:06:51,224 --> 00:06:54,197
If we can hammer
out an agreement.

104
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,200
It's a terrific opportunity.

105
00:06:56,235 --> 00:06:58,638
I get to use my own ship,
pick my own crew

106
00:06:58,673 --> 00:07:00,142
and the best part is

107
00:07:00,177 --> 00:07:02,238
I never have
to leave this sector.

108
00:07:02,281 --> 00:07:04,514
Where are you going to live?

109
00:07:04,553 --> 00:07:06,420
On my ship, I suppose.

110
00:07:06,457 --> 00:07:07,824
Well, why don't you stay here?

111
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,730
I'm sure that Benjamin
could arrange for some quarters.

112
00:07:10,766 --> 00:07:14,297
That's, uh...
not a bad idea.

113
00:07:17,214 --> 00:07:18,808
Yeah.

114
00:07:19,986 --> 00:07:22,287
Well, I... have
a meeting on Bajor

115
00:07:22,325 --> 00:07:23,851
and the shuttle leaves

116
00:07:23,895 --> 00:07:25,330
in a few minutes.

117
00:07:25,365 --> 00:07:27,529
I'll see you tonight?

118
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,349
That answers that.

119
00:07:35,387 --> 00:07:37,585
She's serious.

120
00:07:46,946 --> 00:07:48,245
Captain...

121
00:07:48,315 --> 00:07:51,550
the Cardassian Transport <i>Rabol</i>
is approaching the station.

122
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:53,422
They are requesting
permission to beam

123
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,259
their representative
directly to Ops.

124
00:07:55,331 --> 00:07:57,028
Someone's in a big hurry.

125
00:07:57,068 --> 00:07:58,799
Permission granted.

126
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:00,138
Aye, sir.

127
00:08:05,253 --> 00:08:06,346
Ah!

128
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:07,688
Major Kira.

129
00:08:10,498 --> 00:08:13,471
I'm ready to leave
whenever you are.

130
00:08:26,066 --> 00:08:28,264
We'll be crossing
into the Badlands

131
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,862
in approximately six hours.

132
00:08:29,907 --> 00:08:31,843
Very good, Major.

133
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:34,111
Dukat, let's get
one thing straight.

134
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:35,117
This is my mission.

135
00:08:35,151 --> 00:08:36,450
The only reason you're here

136
00:08:36,488 --> 00:08:39,051
is because I agreed
to let you come along.

137
00:08:39,094 --> 00:08:41,190
When I give an order,
I expect you to follow it

138
00:08:41,232 --> 00:08:42,667
no questions asked.

139
00:08:42,701 --> 00:08:44,797
Believe me, Major,
I want nothing more

140
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,175
than for this mission
to be concluded

141
00:08:47,212 --> 00:08:49,809
as quickly and as efficiently
as possible

142
00:08:49,851 --> 00:08:53,313
and I leave the details
in your capable hands.

143
00:08:53,358 --> 00:08:55,693
Good. Then we shouldn't
have any problems.

144
00:08:58,302 --> 00:08:59,737
There's one thing
I don't understand.

145
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:01,538
Why did the Cardassian
government send you?

146
00:09:02,913 --> 00:09:06,080
The <i>Ravinok</i> was under
my general command.

147
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,487
Those were my troops

148
00:09:07,523 --> 00:09:10,154
and it is my duty
to try to find them.

149
00:09:10,195 --> 00:09:14,136
The question is,
what are you doing here, Major?

150
00:09:15,741 --> 00:09:17,837
I knew someone
aboard the <i>Ravinok.</i>

151
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:19,975
One of the prisoners, I assume?

152
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:22,617
Lorit Akrem.

153
00:09:22,656 --> 00:09:24,626
I see.

154
00:09:24,661 --> 00:09:27,497
So you're on this mission
for personal reasons.

155
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,629
Is there something wrong
with that?

156
00:09:29,672 --> 00:09:31,437
No, not at all.

157
00:09:31,475 --> 00:09:34,607
I've found that when one
has a difficult job to do

158
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:39,251
personal reasons can be
quite an incentive.

159
00:09:39,292 --> 00:09:41,957
So who was he?

160
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:45,063
A family member, a compatriot...

161
00:09:45,105 --> 00:09:46,631
a lover?

162
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,280
Lorit recruited me into
the Shakaar resistance cell.

163
00:09:53,323 --> 00:09:55,624
Ah...

164
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:58,133
the infamous Shakaar resistance.

165
00:09:58,167 --> 00:10:02,199
We never could eliminate
that little group of yours.

166
00:10:02,243 --> 00:10:06,014
And it was not from lack
of trying, I can assure you.

167
00:10:06,051 --> 00:10:09,582
I... hope you don't take this
the wrong way, Major

168
00:10:09,626 --> 00:10:11,406
but I've always admired you.

169
00:10:13,276 --> 00:10:15,839
You are the embodiment
of the new Bajor...

170
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:20,153
a Bajoran born out of the ashes
of the occupation.

171
00:10:20,191 --> 00:10:23,756
A Bajoran tempered
with Cardassian steel.

172
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,294
Oh, Captain Sisko's right.

173
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:28,640
You are in love with
the sound of your own voice.

174
00:10:28,677 --> 00:10:32,914
I know you find this
hard to accept, but...

175
00:10:32,953 --> 00:10:35,049
I believe that, in some ways

176
00:10:35,124 --> 00:10:38,063
the occupation
actually helped Bajor.

177
00:10:38,098 --> 00:10:39,965
Which part?

178
00:10:40,002 --> 00:10:43,066
The massacres
or the strip mining?

179
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,235
I have no desire

180
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:46,977
to debate the merits
of the occupation with you.

181
00:10:47,017 --> 00:10:50,548
I'm even willing to admit that
perhaps we were a little harsh

182
00:10:50,592 --> 00:10:53,656
in our methods, but the fact is,
the Bajoran people

183
00:10:53,698 --> 00:10:57,229
are stronger now than they
have been in centuries.

184
00:10:57,273 --> 00:11:01,146
When we arrived, you were
a weak, contemplative race

185
00:11:01,181 --> 00:11:03,448
choking on your isolation

186
00:11:03,486 --> 00:11:06,014
and now you have
a new confidence

187
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:08,394
a whole new sense of purpose

188
00:11:08,431 --> 00:11:11,198
not to mention a key role

189
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:14,038
in the future
of this entire Quadrant.

190
00:11:14,077 --> 00:11:18,075
All of which Bajor accomplished
in spite of the Cardassians

191
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:19,554
not because of them.

192
00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:22,288
Think what you must

193
00:11:22,328 --> 00:11:24,561
but I believe the time will come

194
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,971
when Cardassia
and Bajor will grow

195
00:11:28,008 --> 00:11:30,502
to be not only allies

196
00:11:30,546 --> 00:11:33,951
but also close friends.

197
00:11:33,987 --> 00:11:37,449
Bajor and Cardassia, maybe.

198
00:11:37,495 --> 00:11:39,556
You and me...

199
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,069
I doubt it.

200
00:11:41,102 --> 00:11:43,938
All I ask is that
you have an open mind.

201
00:11:43,976 --> 00:11:46,140
All right, Dukat, that's enough.

202
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,340
Now, if you don't mind

203
00:11:47,383 --> 00:11:49,410
I would like to spend
the next six hours

204
00:11:49,454 --> 00:11:51,424
in silent meditation.

205
00:11:51,459 --> 00:11:53,930
Is that a request or an order?

206
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:55,900
Whatever it takes.

207
00:11:55,935 --> 00:12:00,206
Well, in that case,
as much as it pains me...

208
00:12:08,864 --> 00:12:10,128
Hmm.

209
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,671
We both might survive
this trip after all.

210
00:12:18,351 --> 00:12:20,948
They didn't even wait
for the interview to be over.

211
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,430
After 20 minutes, Minister Azin
said she'd heard enough

212
00:12:24,464 --> 00:12:26,697
and if I wanted the job,
it was mine.

213
00:12:26,736 --> 00:12:28,467
So what did you tell them?

214
00:12:28,507 --> 00:12:30,671
What do you think I told them?

215
00:12:30,712 --> 00:12:31,771
I said yes.

216
00:12:31,814 --> 00:12:33,283
Congratulations.

217
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:36,549
That's it?

218
00:12:36,591 --> 00:12:38,026
Oh.

219
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,603
That's...
that's not what I meant.

220
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:45,907
I want to know
how you feel about it.

221
00:12:45,945 --> 00:12:49,385
Well... I think it's great.

222
00:12:49,419 --> 00:12:51,218
We'll see a lot more
of each other.

223
00:12:51,323 --> 00:12:54,956
You know, I was thinking
about what Dax said.

224
00:12:54,998 --> 00:12:58,905
Maybe I should get
quarters on the station.

225
00:12:58,941 --> 00:13:01,002
That's a big step.

226
00:13:01,045 --> 00:13:02,776
What does that mean?

227
00:13:06,289 --> 00:13:08,385
Well, I just meant...

228
00:13:08,428 --> 00:13:10,159
it's a big step.

229
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:15,832
A bad big step
or a good big step?

230
00:13:17,815 --> 00:13:19,512
A good one.

231
00:13:19,552 --> 00:13:22,787
Could you muster up
a little more enthusiasm?

232
00:13:22,826 --> 00:13:25,559
I am enthusiastic.

233
00:13:25,599 --> 00:13:27,228
I'm proud of you.

234
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,329
This job...

235
00:13:28,372 --> 00:13:30,433
Forget about the job.

236
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,243
I'm talking about us.

237
00:13:33,349 --> 00:13:36,880
I tell you I'm thinking
about living on the station

238
00:13:36,924 --> 00:13:40,386
and all you can say is,
"it's a big step"?

239
00:13:40,431 --> 00:13:44,736
Oh, I don't think you took it
the way I meant it.

240
00:13:44,775 --> 00:13:48,510
I don't think you know
what you meant, but I do.

241
00:13:48,549 --> 00:13:51,716
You're afraid of commitment.

242
00:13:51,756 --> 00:13:54,284
Who said anything
about commitment?

243
00:13:54,395 --> 00:13:55,624
Obviously not you.

244
00:13:55,665 --> 00:13:58,432
You... you know what?

245
00:13:58,471 --> 00:13:59,906
Forget the whole thing.

246
00:13:59,941 --> 00:14:02,435
I'm not going to take the job.

247
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,951
If you don't want me
to stay here

248
00:14:04,986 --> 00:14:06,147
that's fine with me.

249
00:14:10,063 --> 00:14:11,464
Whew!

250
00:14:31,477 --> 00:14:32,946
How'd you get ahold of this,
Razka?

251
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,816
I bought it off
a Ferengi scrap-metal merchant.

252
00:14:35,853 --> 00:14:41,161
Hmm... it appears to be
composed of uridium alloy.

253
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:42,633
It's definitely Cardassian.

254
00:14:42,668 --> 00:14:44,399
Can you tell if it's
from the <i>Ravinok?</i>

255
00:14:52,757 --> 00:14:55,058
Why didn't you tell me
you were bringing him along?

256
00:14:55,096 --> 00:14:57,260
Because when we talked,
I didn't know I would be.

257
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,268
Too bad.

258
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,863
The Maquis would've
paid handsomely

259
00:14:59,906 --> 00:15:01,067
to get their hands on him.

260
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,304
And my government

261
00:15:02,345 --> 00:15:05,785
would be very happy
to get its hands on you.

262
00:15:06,821 --> 00:15:09,190
Razka Karn, if I'm not mistaken.

263
00:15:09,227 --> 00:15:13,066
Smuggler, thief,
black marketeer.

264
00:15:13,101 --> 00:15:16,233
There are at least
12 outstanding warrants

265
00:15:16,275 --> 00:15:19,942
for your arrest
on Cardassia right now

266
00:15:19,984 --> 00:15:22,581
but I suggest
we ignore all that

267
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,527
and try to cooperate
with one another.

268
00:15:25,562 --> 00:15:28,090
The voice of the new Cardassia...

269
00:15:28,134 --> 00:15:30,799
so compassionate,
so understanding.

270
00:15:30,841 --> 00:15:33,278
Almost makes you forget
that five years ago

271
00:15:33,313 --> 00:15:34,873
he was working
Bajorans to death

272
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:35,976
in forced labor camps

273
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,388
and shooting anybody
who tried to stop him.

274
00:15:38,424 --> 00:15:40,952
Almost makes you forget.

275
00:15:40,996 --> 00:15:43,763
It's from the <i>Ravinok...</i>

276
00:15:43,802 --> 00:15:45,601
no doubt about it.

277
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:48,076
Did the Ferengi tell you
where he found it?

278
00:15:48,111 --> 00:15:49,238
No, but I was curious

279
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,012
so I bribed one
of his crew members.

280
00:15:51,052 --> 00:15:54,150
Turns out his last trip
was to the Dozaria system.

281
00:15:54,192 --> 00:15:56,025
Dozaria...

282
00:15:56,063 --> 00:16:00,300
I believe there is one
Class-M planet in that system.

283
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:02,070
Barely Class-M.

284
00:16:02,109 --> 00:16:04,307
He found that in orbit.

285
00:16:06,686 --> 00:16:08,451
Dozaria it is, then.

286
00:16:10,294 --> 00:16:11,786
Thanks, Razka.

287
00:16:11,831 --> 00:16:13,198
I owe you one.

288
00:16:13,233 --> 00:16:15,704
Just let me know
what you find out.

289
00:16:15,739 --> 00:16:18,108
Lorit was my friend, too.

290
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,427
I just don't understand
how the <i>Ravinok</i>

291
00:16:27,499 --> 00:16:29,435
could have gotten
so far off course.

292
00:16:29,469 --> 00:16:31,599
Dozaria's light years away

293
00:16:31,641 --> 00:16:33,076
from where they
should have been.

294
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,012
The Central Command
always believed

295
00:16:35,049 --> 00:16:36,575
that the ship was destroyed

296
00:16:36,619 --> 00:16:39,956
in some sort of escape attempt
by the Bajoran prisoners.

297
00:16:39,993 --> 00:16:40,983
Maybe.

298
00:16:41,028 --> 00:16:42,223
Or they could
have had a problem

299
00:16:42,264 --> 00:16:43,391
with their navigational array

300
00:16:43,434 --> 00:16:45,905
or run into some kind
of subspace anomaly.

301
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:47,806
Hopefully, we'll find the truth.

302
00:16:50,682 --> 00:16:52,174
We're entering orbit.

303
00:16:55,526 --> 00:16:59,297
Hmm... I'm reading
severe ionic interference

304
00:16:59,335 --> 00:17:01,237
in the planet's atmosphere.

305
00:17:01,272 --> 00:17:03,607
Sensors will be limited,
to say the least.

306
00:17:03,644 --> 00:17:06,879
I'm picking up
a faint magneton signature.

307
00:17:06,918 --> 00:17:09,979
It could be residual radiation
from a damaged warp nacelle.

308
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:10,943
Shall we beam down?

309
00:17:10,981 --> 00:17:12,040
I wouldn't advise it.

310
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,213
All this ionic interference

311
00:17:14,255 --> 00:17:17,022
will scatter our molecules
halfway around the planet.

312
00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:20,125
We're going to have to do this
the old-fashioned way.

313
00:17:20,168 --> 00:17:22,035
It's going to be
a difficult landing.

314
00:17:22,072 --> 00:17:24,805
I'll take the controls
if you like.

315
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,813
That'll be the day.

316
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,408
Going in.

317
00:17:37,472 --> 00:17:39,773
Invigorating, isn't it?

318
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,541
A bit sunny, perhaps

319
00:17:41,581 --> 00:17:43,848
but this heat feels wonderful.

320
00:17:43,886 --> 00:17:44,979
Only a Cardassian

321
00:17:45,021 --> 00:17:47,458
would call
this hellhole invigorating.

322
00:17:47,494 --> 00:17:48,827
Oh, I forgot.

323
00:17:48,864 --> 00:17:52,463
Compared to us, you Bajorans
are a bit fragile...

324
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:54,772
physiologically
speaking, of course.

325
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,439
Don't worry about me.

326
00:18:05,467 --> 00:18:07,061
The <i>Ravinok.</i>

327
00:18:22,738 --> 00:18:24,834
"It's a big step."

328
00:18:24,876 --> 00:18:27,370
That's all you said?

329
00:18:27,415 --> 00:18:28,884
That's all.

330
00:18:28,918 --> 00:18:30,011
You're sure?

331
00:18:30,054 --> 00:18:31,421
Positive.

332
00:18:31,457 --> 00:18:32,892
What do you think, Julian?

333
00:18:32,927 --> 00:18:36,059
It's ambiguous; definitely
open to interpretation.

334
00:18:36,101 --> 00:18:37,330
But it could have been worse.

335
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,272
He could have said,
"It's a very big step."

336
00:18:39,308 --> 00:18:42,041
You didn't say that, did you?

337
00:18:42,081 --> 00:18:44,348
I don't think so.

338
00:18:44,386 --> 00:18:45,855
Well, that's good, anyway.

339
00:18:45,888 --> 00:18:47,585
So what does he do now?

340
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:48,595
It's simple.

341
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:49,928
He goes to Kasidy

342
00:18:49,964 --> 00:18:52,197
admits that everything
was his fault

343
00:18:52,236 --> 00:18:53,728
and pledges his undying love.

344
00:18:53,773 --> 00:18:56,871
That sounds
a little extreme to me.

345
00:18:56,913 --> 00:18:58,940
What if he just tells her
he made a mistake?

346
00:18:59,018 --> 00:19:00,783
That there had been
a misunderstanding

347
00:19:00,821 --> 00:19:02,313
and that he really
would like her

348
00:19:02,358 --> 00:19:03,417
to live on the station?

349
00:19:03,461 --> 00:19:04,794
Could work.

350
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,629
Assuming that's what you want.

351
00:19:06,668 --> 00:19:10,803
Captain, I would
think long and hard

352
00:19:10,843 --> 00:19:12,608
before answering.

353
00:19:12,648 --> 00:19:15,119
I don't recall asking
your opinion, Quark.

354
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,281
Well, maybe you should.

355
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:18,259
I mean, who knows more
about women than me?

356
00:19:18,293 --> 00:19:19,626
Everyone.

357
00:19:19,663 --> 00:19:22,932
You hu-mans...

358
00:19:23,004 --> 00:19:24,769
all you want to do
is please your women.

359
00:19:24,808 --> 00:19:26,209
You want them to be your friends

360
00:19:26,244 --> 00:19:27,770
but we Ferengi know better.

361
00:19:27,815 --> 00:19:29,808
Women are the enemy

362
00:19:29,852 --> 00:19:32,016
and we treat them accordingly.

363
00:19:33,794 --> 00:19:37,929
The key is to never let them
get the upper hand.

364
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:40,840
If she says she
doesn't see you enough

365
00:19:40,876 --> 00:19:43,211
threaten to see her even less.

366
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:44,911
If she wants more gifts

367
00:19:44,952 --> 00:19:47,446
take back the ones
you've already given her.

368
00:19:47,491 --> 00:19:50,190
It's all about control.

369
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:51,723
What if your woman leaves you?

370
00:19:51,767 --> 00:19:54,637
That's what holosuites are for.

371
00:19:54,673 --> 00:19:59,012
It's a wonder the Ferengi
reproduce at all.

372
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,577
So, you never answered
the question.

373
00:20:01,622 --> 00:20:04,595
Do you want her to stay or not?

374
00:20:07,601 --> 00:20:10,038
I appreciate all the advice.

375
00:20:10,073 --> 00:20:12,567
I'll let you know
how it turns out.

376
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:19,316
So, just between you and me,
what do you think

377
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,729
about Kasidy moving
onto the station?

378
00:20:21,766 --> 00:20:24,705
It's a big step.

379
00:20:24,739 --> 00:20:26,174
A very big step.

380
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:35,261
Oh, she didn't just crash.

381
00:20:35,296 --> 00:20:37,027
These are phaser hits.

382
00:20:37,067 --> 00:20:39,834
Looks like she put up
quite a fight.

383
00:20:39,873 --> 00:20:41,604
And paid for it.

384
00:20:58,213 --> 00:21:00,616
12 graves.

385
00:21:00,652 --> 00:21:04,092
There were 18 crew members
and 32 prisoners aboard.

386
00:21:04,126 --> 00:21:06,825
So where's everybody else?

387
00:21:08,636 --> 00:21:10,766
First things first.

388
00:21:13,046 --> 00:21:14,538
What are you doing?

389
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:19,253
We need to identify
these bodies.

390
00:21:19,292 --> 00:21:20,784
I'll help.

391
00:21:20,829 --> 00:21:21,455
No!

392
00:21:27,177 --> 00:21:29,740
Our funeral rites
are very strict.

393
00:21:29,782 --> 00:21:31,649
It would dishonor the dead

394
00:21:31,686 --> 00:21:34,659
for a non-Cardassian
to view the remains.

395
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:37,426
There could be Bajorans
buried here, too.

396
00:21:37,466 --> 00:21:39,163
No doubt.

397
00:21:39,236 --> 00:21:42,072
But, if my memory's correct

398
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:46,449
Bajorans are much more concerned
with the souls of the dead

399
00:21:46,486 --> 00:21:48,821
than they are
with the physical remains.

400
00:21:48,858 --> 00:21:51,591
How did Kai Meressa put it?

401
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:57,907
"What remains after death
is but a shell... a sign

402
00:21:57,944 --> 00:21:59,914
"that the <i>pagh</i> has begun

403
00:21:59,948 --> 00:22:02,784
its final journey
to the Prophets."

404
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:07,662
Please, Major, don't make this
any more difficult for me

405
00:22:07,699 --> 00:22:09,259
than it already is.

406
00:22:13,813 --> 00:22:15,977
I have a list
of the missing Bajorans.

407
00:22:16,017 --> 00:22:17,543
I should be able
to identify them

408
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:19,888
from the family imprint
on the earrings.

409
00:22:19,926 --> 00:22:22,956
I'll work on the <i>Ravinok.</i>

410
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:24,696
I should be able
to get something

411
00:22:24,737 --> 00:22:26,206
from the ship's computers.

412
00:22:26,273 --> 00:22:28,140
You'll need the command codes.

413
00:22:28,177 --> 00:22:30,204
Standard Cardassian
military codes

414
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:31,807
from six years ago, right?

415
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:32,842
Yes.

416
00:22:32,888 --> 00:22:34,448
Yeah, I got them

417
00:22:34,491 --> 00:22:38,489
from Bajoran Intelligence
before we left.

418
00:22:38,533 --> 00:22:41,734
Very good, Major.

419
00:22:41,774 --> 00:22:43,403
Very good.

420
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:40,031
Dukat...

421
00:23:40,068 --> 00:23:42,061
I was able to reactivate the...

422
00:23:48,855 --> 00:23:50,290
Dukat.

423
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,871
What was her name?

424
00:24:01,582 --> 00:24:05,317
I recognize a Bajoran pledge
bracelet when I see one.

425
00:24:07,796 --> 00:24:10,826
Her name was Tora... Naprem.

426
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:16,875
You see, Major...

427
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:18,317
you're not the only one...

428
00:24:18,386 --> 00:24:21,826
who had a friend
aboard that ship.

429
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,161
A friend... is that all she was?

430
00:24:28,308 --> 00:24:30,609
I see.

431
00:24:30,646 --> 00:24:31,739
Don't worry, Dukat.

432
00:24:31,782 --> 00:24:33,980
You're not
the only Cardassian officer

433
00:24:34,021 --> 00:24:35,718
who kept a Bajoran mistress.

434
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,327
It wasn't like that.

435
00:24:41,336 --> 00:24:43,238
Naprem and I...

436
00:24:44,576 --> 00:24:46,877
Loved each other.

437
00:24:46,915 --> 00:24:49,716
The head of the occupation...

438
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:51,459
in love with a Bajoran?

439
00:24:54,565 --> 00:24:56,262
Ironic, isn't it?

440
00:24:56,302 --> 00:24:58,101
Did your wife know?

441
00:24:59,376 --> 00:25:00,811
No...

442
00:25:00,846 --> 00:25:03,819
and she's never going
to find out.

443
00:25:03,852 --> 00:25:05,948
Now, if you don't mind, Major

444
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:08,986
I'd rather not talk
about this right now.

445
00:25:11,937 --> 00:25:13,998
Here are the earrings
you wanted.

446
00:25:23,896 --> 00:25:25,229
No...

447
00:25:26,836 --> 00:25:28,271
If Lorit's dead...

448
00:25:28,306 --> 00:25:31,336
he's not buried here.

449
00:25:33,451 --> 00:25:35,615
According
to the ship's computers

450
00:25:35,656 --> 00:25:39,323
the <i>Ravinok</i> was attacked
by two unidentified warships.

451
00:25:39,364 --> 00:25:41,391
The attackers chased
the <i>Ravinok</i> here

452
00:25:41,435 --> 00:25:43,633
and must have forced her
to crash land.

453
00:25:43,673 --> 00:25:44,698
Then the survivors

454
00:25:44,742 --> 00:25:47,213
could have been captured
and taken away.

455
00:25:47,247 --> 00:25:50,345
Or they could still be here,
somewhere on this planet.

456
00:25:50,388 --> 00:25:52,187
Maybe we should go up
in the runabout

457
00:25:52,225 --> 00:25:53,717
and scan for them from orbit.

458
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:56,029
Too much ionic interference.

459
00:25:56,067 --> 00:25:58,595
The sensors would never be able
to pick up their life signs.

460
00:25:58,639 --> 00:26:00,438
There may be another way.

461
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:04,815
In these conditions,
tricorder readings

462
00:26:04,853 --> 00:26:08,452
will only be about 12 meters,
but that should be enough.

463
00:26:08,494 --> 00:26:09,484
Enough for what?

464
00:26:11,233 --> 00:26:14,229
During the occupation,
Bajoran resistance fighters

465
00:26:14,274 --> 00:26:17,247
carried subdermal implants
of tritonium isotopes.

466
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,219
The idea was
that if they were captured

467
00:26:20,253 --> 00:26:21,688
they could activate the implant

468
00:26:21,724 --> 00:26:24,491
which would leave
a trail of isotopes

469
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:26,089
so they could be
tracked and rescued.

470
00:26:28,472 --> 00:26:30,773
I think I have something.

471
00:26:32,714 --> 00:26:33,682
That way.

472
00:26:33,716 --> 00:26:35,117
Let's go.

473
00:26:44,607 --> 00:26:47,010
I don't know
why we have to stop.

474
00:26:47,045 --> 00:26:48,674
For one thing...

475
00:26:48,716 --> 00:26:52,315
I can't see two meters
in front of us

476
00:26:52,358 --> 00:26:54,328
and, anyway, we could
both use the rest.

477
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:57,266
So stop pacing and sit down.

478
00:27:04,184 --> 00:27:05,152
What is it?!

479
00:27:05,186 --> 00:27:06,347
Oh! Oh! I don't know.

480
00:27:06,388 --> 00:27:09,361
I sat on something.
I sat on something!

481
00:27:09,395 --> 00:27:10,989
Let me see.

482
00:27:11,032 --> 00:27:12,899
Oh!

483
00:27:12,936 --> 00:27:14,337
Oh, get it out.

484
00:27:14,372 --> 00:27:16,205
Well, keep still

485
00:27:16,243 --> 00:27:17,712
and let me see what I can do.

486
00:27:17,746 --> 00:27:19,238
Get it out!

487
00:27:19,283 --> 00:27:21,447
Oh, this is going to hurt.

488
00:27:21,487 --> 00:27:23,788
It already hurts.

489
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:25,726
Just take it out.

490
00:27:25,764 --> 00:27:28,327
If you say so.

491
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,203
Ow!

492
00:27:30,241 --> 00:27:32,302
Oh... oh...

493
00:27:32,345 --> 00:27:33,609
Ouch.

494
00:27:43,202 --> 00:27:47,234
Run this dermal regenerator
over the wound.

495
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,549
Ooh.

496
00:27:55,362 --> 00:27:56,854
This isn't funny!

497
00:27:56,933 --> 00:27:59,166
It is from this angle.

498
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,324
You know what's even funnier?

499
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,829
This doesn't work.

500
00:28:13,936 --> 00:28:15,337
You...

501
00:28:15,373 --> 00:28:16,568
have to...

502
00:28:16,608 --> 00:28:18,669
activate it.

503
00:28:18,714 --> 00:28:21,015
Oh.

504
00:28:22,823 --> 00:28:24,953
Oh, oh, yes.

505
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:27,091
Oh, much better.

506
00:28:31,241 --> 00:28:32,436
Oh.

507
00:28:33,747 --> 00:28:35,410
You probably should
eat one of these.

508
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:37,215
Ah...

509
00:28:37,254 --> 00:28:42,323
I haven't had field rations
in a very long time.

510
00:28:42,365 --> 00:28:46,397
I'm sure they haven't
improved a bit.

511
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:51,844
Actually, they've gotten
a little worse.

512
00:28:55,161 --> 00:28:57,097
Tell me something.

513
00:28:57,131 --> 00:28:58,566
What?

514
00:28:58,601 --> 00:29:00,537
Who's Tora Ziyal?

515
00:29:04,448 --> 00:29:08,287
When I reactivated
the <i>Ravinok's</i> computer, I...

516
00:29:08,322 --> 00:29:09,791
downloaded the manifest.

517
00:29:09,826 --> 00:29:11,796
There were two civilians
on board

518
00:29:11,831 --> 00:29:14,029
in addition to the prisoners
and crew.

519
00:29:14,068 --> 00:29:16,232
One... was your friend...

520
00:29:16,273 --> 00:29:19,405
Tora Naprem...

521
00:29:19,447 --> 00:29:21,178
and the other...

522
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:26,059
was Tora Ziyal...
a 13-year-old girl.

523
00:29:29,302 --> 00:29:31,363
I suppose you wouldn't...

524
00:29:31,406 --> 00:29:36,076
believe me if I told you
she was Naprem's sister?

525
00:29:36,117 --> 00:29:37,916
Mm-mm.

526
00:29:37,954 --> 00:29:40,448
Ziyal is a Cardassian name.

527
00:29:40,493 --> 00:29:42,896
The way I see it...

528
00:29:42,932 --> 00:29:44,925
there's only one explanation.

529
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:49,171
Ziyal

530
00:29:49,212 --> 00:29:50,977
was Naprem's daughter,
and you...

531
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:52,518
I was her father.

532
00:29:55,893 --> 00:29:57,829
Well...

533
00:29:57,865 --> 00:30:03,002
now I know why you're in such
a hurry to find the survivors.

534
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:04,976
You're hoping that...

535
00:30:05,013 --> 00:30:05,981
Oh.

536
00:30:06,016 --> 00:30:10,287
...she's still alive
and you can rescue her.

537
00:30:14,401 --> 00:30:16,132
Not quite.

538
00:30:18,009 --> 00:30:20,948
You see, if my daughter
is still alive

539
00:30:20,983 --> 00:30:25,288
I'll have no choice
but to kill her.

540
00:30:35,948 --> 00:30:37,975
You know I'm not going
to let you do it.

541
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:38,988
I mean it, Dukat.

542
00:30:39,022 --> 00:30:40,992
You are not going
to kill that girl.

543
00:30:41,027 --> 00:30:43,225
Major, why don't you worry
about the other survivors

544
00:30:43,264 --> 00:30:45,394
and let me worry about Ziyal.

545
00:30:45,436 --> 00:30:46,529
After all, she is my daughter.

546
00:30:46,571 --> 00:30:48,097
That's right...
she's your daughter.

547
00:30:48,175 --> 00:30:49,404
And there is nothing
more important

548
00:30:49,445 --> 00:30:50,572
to a Cardassian than family.

549
00:30:50,614 --> 00:30:52,641
At least, that's what your
people are always saying.

550
00:30:52,686 --> 00:30:54,679
I have a wife
and seven children.

551
00:30:54,723 --> 00:30:55,691
They are my family.

552
00:30:55,725 --> 00:30:56,784
They're the ones I must protect.

553
00:30:56,828 --> 00:30:58,092
Well, you should have
thought of that

554
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,394
before you got
involved with Naprem.

555
00:30:59,434 --> 00:31:01,598
You're right.
I should have.

556
00:31:01,638 --> 00:31:03,301
But I made a mistake...

557
00:31:03,342 --> 00:31:04,868
a mistake I intend to correct.

558
00:31:04,912 --> 00:31:07,577
You don't have to take her
back to Cardassia with you.

559
00:31:07,617 --> 00:31:09,086
Let me take her to Bajor.

560
00:31:09,121 --> 00:31:11,285
No one has to know
that you're her father.

561
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:15,658
What kind of life
would that be for her?

562
00:31:15,702 --> 00:31:17,798
Your people have
never exactly welcomed

563
00:31:17,841 --> 00:31:20,312
half-Cardassian children
into your society.

564
00:31:20,346 --> 00:31:22,407
That's why I sent her
and her mother away

565
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,418
in the first place.

566
00:31:23,452 --> 00:31:25,616
I knew the occupation
was coming to an end

567
00:31:25,657 --> 00:31:27,354
and that there'd be
no place for them

568
00:31:27,395 --> 00:31:29,024
on Bajor or Cardassia.

569
00:31:29,065 --> 00:31:31,001
So you sent them
to a prison camp.

570
00:31:31,036 --> 00:31:33,633
They were not on their way
to a prison camp!

571
00:31:33,675 --> 00:31:36,671
The <i>Ravinok</i> was supposed to
rendezvous with a freighter

572
00:31:36,715 --> 00:31:39,779
which would take Naprem
and Ziyal to Lissepia

573
00:31:39,822 --> 00:31:41,348
where they could live out
their lives

574
00:31:41,392 --> 00:31:43,294
in some sort of peace.

575
00:31:43,329 --> 00:31:45,026
I don't understand.

576
00:31:45,066 --> 00:31:47,002
If you cared enough
to help Ziyal then

577
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:48,598
how can you think
about killing her now?

578
00:31:48,642 --> 00:31:49,941
Why not just send her
away again?

579
00:31:49,977 --> 00:31:54,510
Because my position isn't nearly
as stable as it once was.

580
00:31:54,555 --> 00:31:57,322
By aligning myself
with the new civilian government

581
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,852
I've made many enemies, enemies

582
00:31:58,897 --> 00:32:01,232
that wouldn't hesitate
to use Ziyal against me.

583
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:02,795
Listen to you!

584
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,038
It's not your wife
and your seven children

585
00:32:05,077 --> 00:32:06,546
you're protecting, it's you.

586
00:32:06,581 --> 00:32:08,642
By protecting myself,
I am protecting them.

587
00:32:08,686 --> 00:32:10,254
And the only one
who suffers is Ziyal.

588
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:15,092
You would kill your own
daughter to save your career.

589
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:17,624
I don't understand you.

590
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:19,468
You said you loved Naprem.

591
00:32:19,507 --> 00:32:22,503
I saw you crying at her grave.

592
00:32:22,547 --> 00:32:23,914
I...

593
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:26,183
did love her.

594
00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:33,202
And when I bury Ziyal,
I'll weep over her grave

595
00:32:33,237 --> 00:32:35,606
just as I wept over her mother's

596
00:32:35,642 --> 00:32:39,549
but that will not stop me
from doing what I have to do.

597
00:32:39,585 --> 00:32:42,022
Do you understand?

598
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:44,459
And when the time comes

599
00:32:44,496 --> 00:32:47,765
I suggest you stay
out of my way.

600
00:32:57,357 --> 00:32:59,350
Good morning, Jake-o.

601
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:00,727
Morning, Dad.

602
00:33:00,764 --> 00:33:02,233
So...

603
00:33:02,268 --> 00:33:03,931
what's new?

604
00:33:03,971 --> 00:33:06,568
Nog and I
ran into Kasidy last night

605
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:09,138
over at the, uh,
Vulcan restaurant.

606
00:33:09,183 --> 00:33:11,746
I guess she's not going to take
that job after all.

607
00:33:11,788 --> 00:33:13,621
She told you?

608
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,927
Did she say why?

609
00:33:15,964 --> 00:33:17,593
She said you didn't
want her to take it.

610
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,039
Look, Jake...

611
00:33:22,111 --> 00:33:24,639
sometimes things
between men and women

612
00:33:24,684 --> 00:33:25,983
can get a little...

613
00:33:26,019 --> 00:33:27,784
complicated.

614
00:33:27,824 --> 00:33:29,487
Yeah, maybe, but I
don't think this is

615
00:33:29,528 --> 00:33:30,963
one of those times.

616
00:33:30,997 --> 00:33:32,591
It's pretty simple, Dad.

617
00:33:32,634 --> 00:33:33,602
You're scared.

618
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:35,230
What do I have to be afraid of?

619
00:33:35,273 --> 00:33:36,833
A lot.

620
00:33:36,877 --> 00:33:39,474
Kasidy's willing to make
a major change in her life

621
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,781
just to be close to you.

622
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:44,088
If things don't work out,
you're going to feel responsible

623
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,685
and that's scary.

624
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:48,703
You figured out
all this by yourself?

625
00:33:48,737 --> 00:33:50,935
Actually, I talked
with Nog about it.

626
00:33:52,979 --> 00:33:56,043
You talked to Nog about
my relationship with Kasidy?

627
00:33:56,085 --> 00:33:59,115
And we think
you have nothing to worry about.

628
00:33:59,226 --> 00:34:03,065
If Kasidy wants to change jobs,
that's her decision, not yours.

629
00:34:03,135 --> 00:34:05,834
Same thing if she wants to live
on the station.

630
00:34:05,874 --> 00:34:09,645
If things don't work out,
they don't work out.

631
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:15,591
Have you told
any of this to Kasidy?

632
00:34:15,629 --> 00:34:18,499
Nog and I thought about it,
but, uh...

633
00:34:18,535 --> 00:34:21,132
we thought it would be better
if you told her yourself.

634
00:34:22,877 --> 00:34:24,244
I see.

635
00:34:26,252 --> 00:34:28,985
So, uh, what's new with you?

636
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:37,237
Take a look.

637
00:34:43,523 --> 00:34:45,516
Breen?

638
00:34:45,561 --> 00:34:47,497
What are they doing here?

639
00:34:47,532 --> 00:34:48,865
My tricorder's picking up

640
00:34:48,902 --> 00:34:51,841
a large concentration
of dilithium in the area.

641
00:34:51,875 --> 00:34:53,936
They must be using

642
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,451
the survivors of the
<i>Ravinok</i> to mine the ore.

643
00:34:56,485 --> 00:34:58,455
It makes perfect sense.

644
00:34:58,489 --> 00:35:01,894
The Breen homeworld
is a frozen wasteland.

645
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:04,697
This place is about 50
degrees too hot for them.

646
00:35:04,737 --> 00:35:08,370
You approve
of what they're doing?

647
00:35:08,411 --> 00:35:10,644
No! Not at all.

648
00:35:10,683 --> 00:35:13,850
I do admire their ingenuity.

649
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:18,097
What is it?

650
00:35:27,653 --> 00:35:28,986
It's her.

651
00:35:30,292 --> 00:35:32,023
My daughter.

652
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,618
All right, we're going
to need some help.

653
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,325
I'm going to stay here
and keep an eye on things

654
00:35:48,366 --> 00:35:50,427
while you go back to DS9
for reinforcements.

655
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:52,337
I have a better idea.

656
00:35:52,375 --> 00:35:55,940
You go back to the station.
I'll stay here.

657
00:35:55,982 --> 00:35:58,078
I'm sending you back, Dukat.
That's an order.

658
00:35:58,121 --> 00:36:00,615
And I hate to refuse it,
but I'm afraid I must.

659
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,756
You're welcome to file
an official protest

660
00:36:02,797 --> 00:36:05,929
with the Cardassian military
when we get back.

661
00:36:05,971 --> 00:36:09,502
There's no way
I'm leaving you here alone.

662
00:36:09,545 --> 00:36:11,174
Well...

663
00:36:11,216 --> 00:36:14,155
then I suggest we devise a plan

664
00:36:14,189 --> 00:36:17,560
to rescue
these prisoners together.

665
00:36:17,597 --> 00:36:20,968
You need me, Major.

666
00:36:21,004 --> 00:36:22,701
Maybe I do.

667
00:36:22,741 --> 00:36:26,146
But if you hurt that girl...

668
00:36:26,182 --> 00:36:30,089
I promise I'll kill you.

669
00:36:47,896 --> 00:36:49,229
Don't make any noise.
We're here to help.

670
00:36:49,266 --> 00:36:50,895
You're Bajoran!

671
00:36:50,937 --> 00:36:52,429
Gather up as many prisoners
as you can.

672
00:36:52,473 --> 00:36:53,498
Tell them to meet us here.

673
00:36:53,542 --> 00:36:55,011
How many Breen guards
are there?

674
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,447
I'm not sure.

675
00:36:56,482 --> 00:36:58,543
There are always at least
eight in the mines.

676
00:36:58,586 --> 00:36:59,747
How many prisoners?

677
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:01,259
There are only 31 of us left.

678
00:37:01,292 --> 00:37:02,818
What about Lorit Akrem?
Did he make it?

679
00:37:02,862 --> 00:37:05,231
He died in a cave-in
two years ago.

680
00:37:05,268 --> 00:37:06,760
You knew him?

681
00:37:06,805 --> 00:37:08,935
He was a friend.

682
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:11,881
My condolences, Major,
but we don't have time for this.

683
00:37:11,916 --> 00:37:14,285
Tell me where I can find
Tora Ziyal?

684
00:37:14,355 --> 00:37:15,380
Don't tell him anything.

685
00:37:15,423 --> 00:37:16,790
He's a Cardassian.

686
00:37:16,827 --> 00:37:18,022
I don't understand.

687
00:37:18,062 --> 00:37:19,691
There's a peace treaty.

688
00:37:19,733 --> 00:37:21,897
You mean the occupation is over?

689
00:37:21,938 --> 00:37:23,498
I need to find the girl!
Where is she?

690
00:37:35,367 --> 00:37:36,631
Dukat!

691
00:37:52,171 --> 00:37:54,141
Go get the rest
of the prisoners.

692
00:37:54,176 --> 00:37:56,112
Meet me at the entrance
to the mine.

693
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:11,244
Where is Tora Ziyal?

694
00:38:31,591 --> 00:38:33,220
Ziyal.

695
00:38:36,168 --> 00:38:37,603
Father?

696
00:38:39,475 --> 00:38:40,842
Oh, it's really you.

697
00:38:40,878 --> 00:38:42,507
Mother said you'd...

698
00:38:46,356 --> 00:38:49,329
Father, what's wrong?

699
00:38:50,265 --> 00:38:52,759
Dukat, no!

700
00:38:52,804 --> 00:38:54,740
I'm warning you, Dukat.

701
00:38:54,775 --> 00:38:56,142
Don't do it.

702
00:38:57,147 --> 00:38:58,446
I have no choice.

703
00:38:58,483 --> 00:39:00,419
There's always a choice.

704
00:39:00,454 --> 00:39:02,789
You don't want to do this.

705
00:39:02,826 --> 00:39:05,924
If you did, you never would
have told me about Ziyal.

706
00:39:05,967 --> 00:39:06,944
Now put the rifle down.

707
00:39:07,077 --> 00:39:08,876
No.

708
00:39:16,331 --> 00:39:19,235
The Cardassian prisoners...

709
00:39:19,271 --> 00:39:23,076
they told me this would happen.

710
00:39:23,112 --> 00:39:25,777
That you'd never let me go home

711
00:39:25,819 --> 00:39:28,620
but I-I-I didn't,
didn't believe them.

712
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:29,785
Ziyal, run!

713
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:40,511
I used to dream about you
coming to save me.

714
00:39:43,023 --> 00:39:45,551
That's what kept me alive.

715
00:39:45,595 --> 00:39:47,565
Ziyal...

716
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:59,515
If I can't be with you...

717
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:06,032
then I'd rather die.

718
00:40:20,338 --> 00:40:22,639
Let's go home.

719
00:40:34,269 --> 00:40:36,000
Kasidy Yates.

720
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,669
Hello, Ben.

721
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,771
Hold this a second.

722
00:40:39,814 --> 00:40:40,782
About that job

723
00:40:40,816 --> 00:40:42,946
with the Bajoran
Commerce Ministry...

724
00:40:42,988 --> 00:40:44,981
You know someone
who's qualified for it?

725
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:48,693
I know someone who would
be perfect for it... you.

726
00:40:48,734 --> 00:40:51,228
I think you
should take the job.

727
00:40:51,273 --> 00:40:54,109
I want you to take the job.

728
00:40:54,213 --> 00:40:57,117
You've been talking to Jake.

729
00:40:57,186 --> 00:40:58,245
How'd you know?

730
00:40:58,288 --> 00:41:00,053
Oh, he's a smart boy.

731
00:41:00,093 --> 00:41:01,756
Must take after his mother.

732
00:41:06,006 --> 00:41:08,067
I owe you an apology.

733
00:41:08,176 --> 00:41:12,846
You came to tell me
all this wonderful news

734
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:17,090
and all I could say was,
"It's a big step."

735
00:41:17,196 --> 00:41:18,995
I don't know
what I was thinking.

736
00:41:19,034 --> 00:41:21,198
Take a guess.

737
00:41:29,824 --> 00:41:31,487
I wanted to tell you

738
00:41:31,528 --> 00:41:34,261
how happy I was
for you... f-for us

739
00:41:34,301 --> 00:41:37,034
but it didn't come out that way.

740
00:41:39,412 --> 00:41:42,145
I...

741
00:41:42,185 --> 00:41:46,149
I was uncomfortable
and a little nervous.

742
00:41:46,227 --> 00:41:48,163
A little nervous?

743
00:41:48,264 --> 00:41:52,501
All right.
A lot nervous.

744
00:41:57,886 --> 00:42:01,291
I haven't been
in a serious relationship

745
00:42:01,327 --> 00:42:04,300
for a long time, and I didn't

746
00:42:04,334 --> 00:42:06,703
expect to be in one
any time soon...

747
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:10,277
until I met you.

748
00:42:12,251 --> 00:42:15,918
This life I lead...

749
00:42:15,959 --> 00:42:18,658
this job I do...

750
00:42:20,402 --> 00:42:22,395
that's what got Jennifer killed.

751
00:42:24,845 --> 00:42:27,943
If anything ever
happened to you...

752
00:42:27,985 --> 00:42:31,926
Why not let me
worry about that?

753
00:42:33,565 --> 00:42:35,000
That's what Jake said.

754
00:42:35,034 --> 00:42:38,064
You see? Smart boy.

755
00:42:38,107 --> 00:42:40,408
Look, I could stay here

756
00:42:40,446 --> 00:42:43,886
and listen to you
apologize all day

757
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,321
but I've got to get to Bajor.

758
00:42:45,357 --> 00:42:46,826
Bajor?

759
00:42:46,861 --> 00:42:47,829
I thought...

760
00:42:47,863 --> 00:42:49,993
Oh, I know what you thought

761
00:42:50,033 --> 00:42:51,696
but I took the job.

762
00:42:51,737 --> 00:42:55,074
Do you think I'd give
up a great opportunity

763
00:42:55,111 --> 00:42:57,013
just because you got cold feet?

764
00:42:59,053 --> 00:43:01,456
You're a good man,
Benjamin Sisko

765
00:43:01,492 --> 00:43:03,690
but you've got a lot
to learn about women...

766
00:43:03,731 --> 00:43:05,360
especially this one.

767
00:43:05,401 --> 00:43:07,394
I'll see you when I get back.

768
00:43:07,438 --> 00:43:12,609
You can... help me
pick out quarters.

769
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:15,589
I'll be here.

770
00:43:26,047 --> 00:43:27,812
What was it like...

771
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:29,251
all that time alone with Dukat?

772
00:43:29,353 --> 00:43:31,483
I've had better weeks

773
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:33,495
but I'll never forget
the look on his face

774
00:43:33,529 --> 00:43:35,590
when he sat on that sand spine.

775
00:43:36,836 --> 00:43:38,203
I wish I'd been there.

776
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:39,868
Major.

777
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:41,277
Dukat.

778
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:42,370
Where's Ziyal?

779
00:43:42,415 --> 00:43:44,282
Waiting for me aboard my ship.

780
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:47,223
We'll be leaving
for Cardassia shortly.

781
00:43:47,259 --> 00:43:51,132
I think I'll leave
the two of you alone.

782
00:43:52,638 --> 00:43:56,409
I just wanted to say...
thank you, Major

783
00:43:56,446 --> 00:43:58,974
for a most interesting journey.

784
00:43:59,019 --> 00:44:01,650
You're taking Ziyal back
to Cardassia with you.

785
00:44:01,691 --> 00:44:06,030
After six years,
she deserves a home...

786
00:44:06,067 --> 00:44:07,536
and a father.

787
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:09,837
Won't that make things
difficult for you?

788
00:44:15,922 --> 00:44:18,052
I'll let you know.
