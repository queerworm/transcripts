1
00:00:00,876 --> 00:00:02,711
(<i> beeping</i> )

2
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:03,921
Worf to Major Kira.

3
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:06,381
(<i> sighing</i> ):
This is Kira.

4
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:09,969
Major, you have an incoming
transmission from a...

5
00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:11,971
Razka Karn.

6
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:13,889
He claims to be an old friend.

7
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,142
Put him through.

8
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:23,732
Razka... it's been awhile.

9
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,150
How's business?

10
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,735
Oh, let's just say,
I miss the old days

11
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:27,736
on Bajor.

12
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:28,946
Smuggling might not

13
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:31,323
have been
the safest line of work,

14
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:34,368
but it was a lot more exciting
than selling scrap metal.

15
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,244
What's on your mind, Razka?

16
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:39,790
I picked up a lead
on the<i> Ravinok.</i>

17
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:43,460
Like the last time?

18
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,462
Last time, it was just a rumor.

19
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,590
This time I've got evidence--
a fragment of metal.

20
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,301
Looks like it's part
of the forward sensor array.

21
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:54,471
Can you bring it
to Deep Space 9 for analysis?

22
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:57,474
Sorry, I'm afraid I can't leave
the Badlands right now.

23
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,976
Important business.

24
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:00,811
You understand.

25
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:02,479
Tholians are after you again.

26
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,483
Let's just say it would be
better if you came to me.

27
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,568
(<i> sighs</i> )

28
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,446
It's been six years.

29
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,574
Even if you<i> have</i> found
a piece of the<i> Ravinok,</i>

30
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,409
it doesn't mean
there are any survivors.

31
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:19,287
There's only one way
for you to find out.

32
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,081
I'll be waiting.

33
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:26,581
And item number 17,
Trelos Vren was arrested

34
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:29,043
on the Promenade outside
of the Klingon restaurant.

35
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:31,795
He's being held on four
counts of petty theft.

36
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:34,840
Trelos Vren... where have I
heard that name before?

37
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,299
We arrested him once

38
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,259
for attempting to break
into the Assay Office.

39
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,137
And now he's taken up
pick-pocketing?

40
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:42,263
Mmm... without much success.

41
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:47,895
Still, I suppose you
should admire him

42
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,313
for his persistence.

43
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:54,234
That was a joke.

44
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,196
I'm sorry, Odo.

45
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,117
I may have a lead
on the<i> Ravinok.</i>

46
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,619
I know what you're
going to say.

47
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,538
It's been six years since
the<i> Ravinok</i> disappeared.

48
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:08,582
Odds are,
everyone on board is dead.

49
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:09,875
That all may be true,

50
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,293
but that is not
what I was going to say.

51
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,963
I was going to say "good luck."

52
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,382
Good luck?

53
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,094
You had a friend aboard
the<i> Ravinok,</i> correct?

54
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:22,804
Lorit Akrem.

55
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,306
Which means it doesn't matter

56
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:27,142
if I think
there are any survivors,

57
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,936
of even if you think
there are any survivors.

58
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:31,354
You're going to go
looking for that ship,

59
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34,191
and all I can say
is "good luck."

60
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,359
And I hope you find them.

61
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:43,992
(<i> door chimes</i> )

62
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,410
Come in.

63
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,955
Captain.

64
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,289
You here
to see me off?

65
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,209
I'm afraid not.

66
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,419
I'd like for you
to postpone your trip

67
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,336
for at least
a day or two.

68
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:56,546
What's wrong?

69
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,090
Somehow
the Cardassian government

70
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,968
got wind of your plan
to search for the<i> Ravinok.</i>

71
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:04,304
They've asked permission
to send someone with you.

72
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,764
And you said yes?

73
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:08,142
I said I'd talk
to you about it.

74
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:13,063
The<i> Ravinok</i> was
a Cardassian ship.

75
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:15,941
Carrying Bajoran prisoners.

76
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:22,489
No, I'm not stopping
anyone else from looking.

77
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,950
I just don't see why
they have to come with me.

78
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,451
(<i> sighs</i> )

79
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,869
The request came directly

80
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,747
from the leader
of the new civilian government.

81
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:33,250
Nerys...

82
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,211
I know this isn't
what you had in mind,

83
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:40,924
but Bajor and Cardassia
must learn to work together,

84
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:46,305
and that means cooperating
on missions like these.

85
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,518
All right.

86
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,854
Just tell them
I'm not going to wait forever.

87
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,647
If their representative
isn't here

88
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,941
within 52 hours,
I'm going alone.

89
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,325
I'll be sure
they get the message.

90
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,293
So, did you and Kasidy

91
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:17,752
have a nice time
last night?

92
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,172
Huh. I just wish she
wasn't leaving tomorrow.

93
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:22,090
Sounds like the two of you
are getting serious.

94
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,675
I don't know about that.

95
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:25,927
I don't think Kasidy is
looking to get serious.

96
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:26,928
Ben!

97
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:27,929
Kasidy!

98
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,015
We were just
talking about you.

99
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:31,390
I don't mean
to interrupt.

100
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,809
I wanted you to know

101
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,145
that I won't be leaving
tomorrow after all.

102
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:38,857
Ah, that's good news.
I mean, that's great.

103
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,108
How long are you
going to be here?

104
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,276
Well, that depends

105
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:42,777
on whether I get
this new job or not.

106
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,821
I've, uh, applied
for a position

107
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,823
with the Bajoran
Ministry of Commerce

108
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,491
to captain one of
their freighters.

109
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,244
You're going to work
for the Bajorans?

110
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:53,330
If we can hammer
out an agreement.

111
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,249
It's a terrific opportunity.

112
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,750
I get to use my own ship,
pick my own crew,

113
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,668
and the best part is,

114
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,380
I never have to
leave this sector.

115
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,590
Where are you going to live?

116
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,466
On my ship, I suppose.

117
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,760
Well, why don't you stay here?

118
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,886
I'm sure that Benjamin

119
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,679
could arrange
for some quarters.

120
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:13,558
That's, uh...
not a bad idea.

121
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:17,979
Yeah.

122
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,482
Well, I... have
a meeting on Bajor,

123
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:22,943
and the shuttle leaves

124
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,485
in a few minutes.

125
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,821
I'll see you
tonight?

126
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,537
That answers that.

127
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,873
She's serious.

128
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,342
Captain...

129
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:48,969
the Cardassian
Transport<i> Rabol</i>

130
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,678
is approaching
the station.

131
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,097
They are requesting
permission to beam

132
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,391
their representative
directly to Ops.

133
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,143
Someone's in a big hurry.

134
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,061
Permission granted.

135
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,271
Aye, sir.

136
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:05,485
Ah!

137
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,028
Major Kira.

138
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,533
I'm ready to leave
whenever you are.

139
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,382
We'll be crossing
into the Badlands

140
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:28,758
in approximately six hours.

141
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,677
Very good, Major.

142
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,096
Dukat, let's get
one thing straight.

143
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,055
This is my mission.

144
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,474
The only reason you're here

145
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:37,976
is because I agreed
to let you come along.

146
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,145
When I give an order,
I expect you to follow it,

147
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,396
no questions asked.

148
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,606
Believe me, Major,
I want nothing more

149
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,275
than for this mission
to be concluded

150
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:48,569
as quickly and as
efficiently as possible,

151
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:52,157
and I leave the details
in your capable hands.

152
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,534
Good. Then we shouldn't
have any problems.

153
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,538
There's one thing
I don't understand.

154
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,457
Why did the Cardassian
government send you?

155
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,045
The<i> Ravinok</i> was under
my general command.

156
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,463
Those were my troops,

157
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:09,132
and it is my duty
to try to find them.

158
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:13,136
The question is,
what are you doing here, Major?

159
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,806
I knew someone
aboard the<i> Ravinok.</i>

160
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,933
One of the prisoners, I assume?

161
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,561
Lorit Akrem.

162
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,313
I see.

163
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:26,400
So you're on this mission
for personal reasons.

164
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,609
Is there something wrong
with that?

165
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,362
No, not at all.

166
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:33,614
I've found that when one
has a difficult job to do,

167
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:38,203
personal reasons can be
quite an incentive.

168
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:40,872
So who was he?

169
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:44,000
A family member, a compatriot...

170
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,626
a lover?

171
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:49,089
(<i> sighs</i> )

172
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:52,092
Lorit recruited me into
the Shakaar resistance cell.

173
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,553
Ah...

174
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:56,846
the infamous Shakaar resistance.

175
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:00,934
We never could eliminate
that little group of yours.

176
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:04,604
And it was not from lack
of trying, I can assure you.

177
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:08,400
I... hope you don't take this
the wrong way, Major,

178
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,610
but I've always admired you.

179
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:15,031
You are the embodiment
of the new Bajor--

180
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,408
a Bajoran born

181
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:19,327
out of the ashes
of the occupation.

182
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,914
A Bajoran tempered
with Cardassian steel.

183
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:25,584
Oh, Captain Sisko's right.

184
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,752
You<i> are</i> in love with
the sound of your own voice.

185
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:32,006
I know you find this
hard to accept, but...

186
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:35,009
I believe that,
in some ways,

187
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,262
the occupation
actually helped Bajor.

188
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,055
Which part?

189
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,765
The massacres
or the strip mining?

190
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,225
I have no desire

191
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:46,020
to debate the merits
of the occupation with you.

192
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,732
I'm even willing to admit that
perhaps we were a little harsh

193
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:50,942
in our methods,

194
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,819
but the fact is,
the Bajoran people

195
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:56,490
are stronger now than they
have been in centuries.

196
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:00,452
When we arrived, you were
a weak, contemplative race,

197
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:02,621
choking on your isolation,

198
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:05,373
and now you have
a new confidence,

199
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,584
a whole new sense of purpose,

200
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:10,545
not to mention a key role

201
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:13,173
in the future
of this entire Quadrant.

202
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:17,427
All of which Bajor accomplished
in spite of the Cardassians,

203
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:18,761
not because of them.

204
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,722
Think what you must,

205
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,682
but I believe the time will come

206
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:27,270
when Cardassia
and Bajor will grow

207
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,772
to be not only allies,

208
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:33,067
but also close friends.

209
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:36,571
Bajor and Cardassia, maybe.

210
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,739
You and me...

211
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,116
I doubt it.

212
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,243
All I ask is that
you have an open mind.

213
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,330
All right, Dukat,
that's enough.

214
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,705
Now, if you don't mind

215
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,833
I would like to spend
the next six hours

216
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,460
in silent meditation.

217
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,753
Is that a request
or an order?

218
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,048
Whatever it takes.

219
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:59,553
Well, in that case, as
much as it pains me...

220
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,521
Hmm.

221
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:11,939
We both might survive
this trip after all.

222
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:20,532
They didn't even wait for
the interview to be over.

223
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:23,284
After 20 minutes, Minister
Azin said she'd heard enough

224
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,328
and if I wanted the job,
it was mine.

225
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,121
So what did
you tell them?

226
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,747
What do you think I told them?

227
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,542
I said yes.

228
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:32,168
Congratulations.

229
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,255
That's it?

230
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,839
Oh.

231
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,177
That's...
that's not what I meant.

232
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:44,889
I want to know
how you feel about it.

233
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:48,476
Well... I think
it's great.

234
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,395
We'll see a lot more
of each other.

235
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:53,981
You know, I was thinking
about what Dax said.

236
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:57,860
Maybe I should get
quarters on the station.

237
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,029
That's a big step.

238
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,864
What does that mean?

239
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,579
Well, I just meant...

240
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:09,205
it's a big step.

241
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:14,919
A bad big step
or a good big step?

242
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:18,423
A good one.

243
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:21,800
Could you muster up
a little more enthusiasm?

244
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,471
I<i> am</i> enthusiastic.

245
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,347
I'm proud of you.

246
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,474
This job...

247
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,392
Forget about
the job.

248
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:32,186
I'm talking about us.

249
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:35,690
I tell you I'm thinking
about living on the station,

250
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:39,235
and all you can say is,
"it's a big step"?

251
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:43,573
Oh, I don't think you took it
the way I meant it.

252
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:47,452
I don't think you know
what you meant, but I do.

253
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:50,622
You're afraid of commitment.

254
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:53,416
Who said anything
about commitment?

255
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,584
Obviously
not you.

256
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:57,629
You... you know what?

257
00:13:57,629 --> 00:13:58,879
Forget the whole thing.

258
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,466
I'm not going to take the job.

259
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:04,010
If you don't want me
to stay here,

260
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,136
that's fine with me.

261
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,725
Whew!

262
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:31,746
How'd you get ahold
of this, Razka?

263
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:32,997
I bought it off

264
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,833
a Ferengi scrap-
metal merchant.

265
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:39,962
Hmm... it appears to be
composed of uridium alloy.

266
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,548
It's definitely
Cardassian.

267
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,591
Can you tell if it's
from the<i> Ravinok?</i>

268
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:52,600
Why didn't you tell me

269
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,185
you were bringing
him along?

270
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:55,812
Because when we talked,
I didn't know I would be.

271
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,063
Too bad.

272
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,648
The Maquis would've
paid handsomely

273
00:14:58,648 --> 00:14:59,691
to get their
hands on him.

274
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,067
DUKAT:
And my government

275
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:04,571
would be very happy
to get its hands on you.

276
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:05,739
(<i> laughs</i> )

277
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:08,157
Razka Karn,
if I'm not mistaken.

278
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:11,994
Smuggler, thief,
black marketeer.

279
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,496
There are at least

280
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:16,332
12 outstanding warrants
for your arrest

281
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,835
on Cardassia right now,

282
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,337
but I suggest
we ignore all that

283
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:24,340
and try to cooperate
with one another.

284
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,801
The voice of the new Cardassia--

285
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:29,596
so compassionate,
so understanding.

286
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:32,014
Almost makes you forget
that five years ago

287
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,349
he was working
Bajorans to death

288
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,726
in forced labor camps

289
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:37,353
and shooting anybody
who tried to stop him.

290
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,773
<i>Almost</i> makes you forget.

291
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:42,567
It's from the<i> Ravinok...</i>

292
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:44,485
no doubt about it.

293
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,946
Did the Ferengi tell you
where he found it?

294
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,155
No, but I was curious,

295
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,783
so I bribed one
of his crew members.

296
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:53,035
Turns out his last trip
was to the Dozaria system.

297
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,829
DUKAT:
Dozaria...

298
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,456
I believe there is

299
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:59,083
one Class-M planet
in that system.

300
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,794
Barely Class-M.

301
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:03,129
He found that in orbit.

302
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,548
(<i> sighs</i> )

303
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,341
Dozaria it is, then.

304
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,511
Thanks, Razka.

305
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,888
I owe you one.

306
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:14,265
Just let me know
what you find out.

307
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,893
Lorit was
my friend, too.

308
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,277
I just don't understand
how the<i> Ravinok</i>

309
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:28,237
could have gotten
so far off course.

310
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,448
Dozaria's light years away

311
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:31,699
from where they
should have been.

312
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,660
The Central Command
always believed

313
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,328
that the ship was destroyed

314
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:38,581
in some sort of escape attempt
by the Bajoran prisoners.

315
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:39,666
Maybe.

316
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:40,875
Or they could
have had a problem

317
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,168
with their
navigational array

318
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,504
or run into some kind
of subspace anomaly.

319
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,464
Hopefully, we'll
find the truth.

320
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,927
We're entering orbit.

321
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:57,892
Hmm... I'm reading severe
ionic interference

322
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,936
in the planet's
atmosphere.

323
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:02,480
Sensors will be limited,
to say the least.

324
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,648
I'm picking up

325
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,483
a faint magneton signature.

326
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:09,362
It could be residual radiation
from a damaged warp nacelle.

327
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,363
Shall we beam down?

328
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,447
I wouldn't
advise it.

329
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,491
All this ionic interference

330
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:16,452
will scatter our molecules
halfway around the planet.

331
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,455
We're going to have to do this
the old-fashioned way.

332
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,457
It's going to be
a difficult landing.

333
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,168
I'll take the controls
if you like.

334
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,379
That'll be the day.

335
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:27,839
Going in.

336
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:39,225
Invigorating, isn't it?

337
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,935
A bit sunny, perhaps

338
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:43,062
but this heat feels wonderful.

339
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,397
Only a Cardassian

340
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,816
would call this
hellhole invigorating.

341
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,359
Oh, I forgot.

342
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:51,779
Compared to us, you Bajorans
are a bit fragile...

343
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,073
physiologically
speaking, of course.

344
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,742
Don't worry
about me.

345
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:57,618
(<i> Dukat chuckles</i> )

346
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,622
(<i> breathing heavily</i> )

347
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,669
The<i> Ravinok.</i>

348
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,686
"It's a big step."

349
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:26,146
That's all you said?

350
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,690
That's all.

351
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:28,858
You're sure?

352
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,068
Positive.

353
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:31,652
DAX: What do you
think, Julian?

354
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,864
It's ambiguous; definitely
open to interpretation.

355
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:36,365
But it could
have been worse.

356
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,909
He could have said,
"It's a<i> very</i> big step."

357
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:40,828
You<i> didn't</i> say
that, did you?

358
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,205
I don't think so.

359
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,624
Well, that's good, anyway.

360
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,292
So what does
he do now?

361
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,293
It's simple.

362
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,628
He goes to Kasidy,

363
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,964
admits that everything
was his fault,

364
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:52,465
and pledges
his undying love.

365
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,635
BASHIR: That sounds
a little extreme to me.

366
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,762
What if he just tells her
he made a mistake?

367
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:59,513
That there had been
a misunderstanding,

368
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,807
and that he really
would like her

369
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,100
to live on
the station?

370
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,476
Could work.

371
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,394
Assuming that's
what<i> you</i> want.

372
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:09,649
Captain, I would
think long and hard

373
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,484
before answering.

374
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,861
I don't recall asking
your opinion, Quark.

375
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,195
Well, maybe you should.

376
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:17,031
I mean, who knows more
about women than me?

377
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:18,491
Everyone.

378
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:21,619
You hu-mans...

379
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,370
all you want to do
is please your women.

380
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,914
You want them
to be your friends,

381
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,415
but we Ferengi
know better.

382
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,459
Women are the enemy,

383
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,711
and we treat them
accordingly.

384
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:36,509
The key is to never let them
get the upper hand.

385
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,428
If she says she
doesn't see you enough,

386
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,931
threaten to see her
even less.

387
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,474
If she wants more gifts,

388
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:46,185
take back the ones
you've already given her.

389
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,771
It's all about control.

390
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,439
What if your woman
leaves you?

391
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,359
That's what
holosuites are for.

392
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,195
BASHIR: It's a wonder
the Ferengi

393
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,571
reproduce at all.

394
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:00,324
So, you never answered
the question.

395
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,369
Do you want her
to stay or not?

396
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,499
I appreciate all the advice.

397
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:11,335
I'll let you know
how it turns out.

398
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,716
So, just between
you and me,

399
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:17,967
what do you think

400
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,469
about Kasidy moving
onto the station?

401
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,472
It's a big step.

402
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,807
A very big step.

403
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:33,900
Oh, she didn't
just crash.

404
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,484
These are phaser hits.

405
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,612
Looks like she put up
quite a fight.

406
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,322
And paid for it.

407
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:59,258
12 graves.

408
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,553
There were 18 crew members
and 32 prisoners aboard.

409
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:05,639
So where's
everybody else?

410
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,560
First things first.

411
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:13,231
What are you doing?

412
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:16,567
We need to identify
these bodies.

413
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,403
I'll help.

414
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,696
No!

415
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,659
(<i> sighs</i> )

416
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,454
Our funeral rites
are very strict.

417
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,248
It would dishonor the dead

418
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:33,126
for a non-Cardassian
to view the remains.

419
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:36,003
There could be Bajorans
buried here, too.

420
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,713
No doubt.

421
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,549
But, if my memory's correct,

422
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:44,971
Bajorans are much more concerned
with the souls of the dead

423
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:47,514
than they are
with the physical remains.

424
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:50,184
How did Kai Meressa put it?

425
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:56,523
"What remains after death
is but a shell... a sign

426
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,609
"that the<i> pagh</i> has begun

427
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:01,195
its final journey
to the Prophets."

428
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:06,366
Please, Major, don't make this
any more difficult for me

429
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:07,827
than it already is.

430
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,500
I have a list
of the missing Bajorans.

431
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,210
I should be able
to identify them

432
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,587
from the family imprint
on the earrings.

433
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:21,715
I'll work on the<i> Ravinok.</i>

434
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,342
I should be able
to get something

435
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,760
from the ship's computers.

436
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,595
You'll need
the command codes.

437
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,722
Standard Cardassian
military codes

438
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,390
from six years
ago, right?

439
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,433
Yes.

440
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,019
Yeah, I got them

441
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:37,023
from Bajoran Intelligence
before we left.

442
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:40,400
Very good, Major.

443
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,028
Very good.

444
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:46,199

Dukat...

447
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,836
I was able to reactivate the...

448
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:48,594
Dukat.

449
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:55,601
(<i> sighs</i> )

450
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,353
What was her name?

451
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:03,734
I recognize a Bajoran pledge
bracelet when I see one.

452
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:09,365
Her name was Tora... Naprem.

453
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,329
You see, Major...

454
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:16,663
you're not the only one...

455
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:20,209
who had a friend
aboard that ship.

456
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:22,502
A friend... is that all she was?

457
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,634
I see.

458
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:30,052
Don't worry, Dukat.

459
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:32,263
You're not
the only Cardassian officer

460
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:34,181
who kept a Bajoran mistress.

461
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:37,684
It wasn't like that.

462
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,563
Naprem and I...

463
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,192
loved each other.

464
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:48,154
The head of the occupation...

465
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:50,572
in love with a Bajoran?

466
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:55,369
Ironic, isn't it?

467
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:57,204
Did your wife know?

468
00:24:58,331 --> 00:24:59,665
No...

469
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:02,835
and she's never going
to find out.

470
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,920
Now, if you don't mind, Major,

471
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,132
I'd rather not talk
about this right now.

472
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:13,137
Here are the
earrings you wanted.

473
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,398
No...

474
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,360
If Lorit's dead...

475
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,528
he's not buried here.

476
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,574
According
to the ship's computers,

477
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:38,412
the<i> Ravinok</i> was attacked
by two unidentified warships.

478
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:40,498
The attackers chased
the<i> Ravinok here</i>

479
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:42,375
and must have forced her
to crash land.

480
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:43,709
Then the
survivors

481
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:46,128
could have been captured
and taken away.

482
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:49,340
Or they could still be here,
somewhere on this planet.

483
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,258
Maybe we should go up
in the runabout

484
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,718
and scan for them from orbit.

485
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:55,012
Too much ionic interference.

486
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:57,515
The sensors would never be able
to pick up their life signs.

487
00:25:57,515 --> 00:25:59,475
There may be another way.

488
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:03,729
In these conditions,
tricorder readings

489
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:05,814
will only be
about 12 meters,

490
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,483
but that should
be enough.

491
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:08,526
Enough for what?

492
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:12,405
During the occupation,
Bajoran resistance fighters

493
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:16,283
carried subdermal implants
of tritonium isotopes.

494
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:19,119
The idea was
that if they were captured

495
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,578
they could activate
the implant,

496
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:23,457
which would leave
a trail of isotopes

497
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,125
so they could be
tracked and rescued.

498
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,503
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

499
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:29,796
I think I have
something.

500
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:32,632
That way.

501
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,218
Let's go.

502
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:46,063
DUKAT:
I don't know why
we have to stop.

503
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:47,523
For one thing...

504
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:51,318
I can't see two meters
in front of us,

505
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,404
and, anyway, we could
both use the rest.

506
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:56,365
So stop pacing and sit down.

Get it out!

Oh, this is
going to hurt.

520
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:22,891
It already hurts.

521
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,684
Just take it out.

522
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:27,480
If you say so.

523
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,315
Ow!

00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:25,954
Oh, much better.

541
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,251
Oh.

542
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:34,505
You probably should
eat one of these.

543
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:36,131
Ah...

544
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:41,261
I haven't had field rations
in a very long time.

545
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:45,265
I'm sure they haven't
improved a bit.

546
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:50,604
Actually, they've gotten
a little worse.

547
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:52,606
(<i> chuckles</i> )

548
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,901
Tell me something.

549
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,444
What?

550
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,488
Who's Tora Ziyal?

551
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:07,246
When I reactivated
the<i> Ravinok's</i> computer, I...

552
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:08,581
downloaded the manifest.

553
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:10,499
There were two civilians
on board

554
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,876
in addition to the prisoners
and crew.

555
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,920
One... was your friend...

556
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,173
Tora Naprem...

557
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,966
and the other...

558
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:24,846
was Tora Ziyal...
a 13-year-old girl.

559
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:30,227
I suppose you wouldn't...

560
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:34,814
believe me if I told you
she was Naprem's sister?

561
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,567
Mm-mm.

562
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:39,236
Ziyal is a Cardassian name.

563
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:41,488
The way I see it...

564
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,616
there's only one explanation.

565
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:47,745
Ziyal

566
00:29:47,745 --> 00:29:49,705
was Naprem's daughter,
and you...

567
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:51,331
I was her father.

568
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,295
Well...

569
00:29:56,295 --> 00:30:01,675
now I know why you're in such
a hurry to find the survivors.

570
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:03,594
You're hoping that...

571
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:05,763
Oh.

572
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:09,015
...she's still alive
and you can rescue her.

573
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:13,061
(<i> sighs</i> )

574
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,813
Not quite.

575
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:19,443
You see, if my daughter
is still alive,

576
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:23,989
I'll have no choice
but to kill her.

577
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,710
You know I'm not going
to let you do it.

578
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,211
I mean it, Dukat.

579
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,921
You are not going
to kill that girl.

580
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,215
Major, why don't you worry
about the other survivors

581
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,092
and let me worry
about Ziyal.

582
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,511
After all,
she<i> is</i> my daughter.

583
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:46,720
That's right--
she's your daughter.

584
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,263
And there is nothing
more important

585
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,640
to a Cardassian
than family.

586
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,724
At least, that's
what your people

587
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:51,850
are always saying.

588
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,393
I have a wife
and seven children.

589
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:54,520
They are my family.

590
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,854
They're the ones
I must protect.

591
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,189
Well, you should have
thought of that

592
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:58,649
before you got
involved with Naprem.

593
00:30:58,649 --> 00:31:00,442
You're right.
I should have.

594
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:02,361
But I made a mistake--

595
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:04,154
a mistake I
intend to correct.

596
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:06,490
You don't have to take her
back to Cardassia with you.

597
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,907
Let me take her to Bajor.

598
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:10,076
No one has to know
that you're her father.

599
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:14,164
What kind of life
would that be for her?

600
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:16,542
Your people have
never exactly welcomed

601
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:19,085
half-Cardassian children
into your society.

602
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,087
That's why I sent her
and her mother away

603
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:22,506
in the first place.

604
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:24,049
I knew the occupation
was coming to an end

605
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:26,092
and that there'd be
no place for them

606
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:27,761
on Bajor or Cardassia.

607
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:29,847
So you sent them
to a prison camp.

608
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:32,391
They were not on their way
to a prison camp!

609
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:34,434
The<i> Ravinok</i> was
supposed to rendezvous

610
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,769
with a freighter,

611
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:38,522
which would take Naprem
and Ziyal to Lissepia,

612
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:40,315
where they could live out
their lives

613
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,108
in some sort of peace.

614
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,736
I don't understand.

615
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:45,779
If you cared enough
to help Ziyal then

616
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,113
how can you think
about killing her now?

617
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,574
Why not just send her
away again?

618
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:51,869
Because my position
isn't nearly as stable

619
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:52,911
as it once was.

620
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,162
By aligning myself

621
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,039
with the new
civilian government,

622
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,541
I've made many
enemies, enemies

623
00:31:57,541 --> 00:32:00,085
that wouldn't hesitate
to use Ziyal against me.

624
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:01,461
Listen to you!

625
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,589
It's not your wife
and your seven children

626
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:05,173
you're protecting,
it's you.

627
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,384
By protecting myself,
I am protecting them.

628
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:09,219
And the only one
who suffers is Ziyal.

629
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:14,182
You would kill your own
daughter to save your career.

630
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,643
I don't understand you.

631
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,395
You said you loved Naprem.

632
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:21,481
I saw you crying
at her grave.

633
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:22,941
I...

634
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,318
did love her.

635
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:32,158
And when I bury Ziyal,
I'll weep over her grave,

636
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:34,536
just as I wept
over her mother's,

637
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,329
but that will not stop me

638
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,457
from doing
what I have to do.

639
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:41,126
Do you understand?

640
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:43,253
And when the time comes,

641
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:46,757
I suggest you stay
out of my way.

642
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:58,184
Good morning, Jake-o.

643
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,686
Morning, Dad.

644
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,271
So...

645
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:02,898
what's new?

646
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,442
Nog and I ran into
Kasidy last night

647
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:08,111
over at the, uh,
Vulcan restaurant.

648
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,696
I guess she's not
going to take

649
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:10,781
that job after all.

650
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:12,616
She told you?

651
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,827
Did she say why?

652
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:16,536
She said you didn't
want her to take it.

653
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:19,331
(<i> sighs</i> )

654
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:21,124
Look, Jake...

655
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,627
sometimes things
between men and women

656
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:25,044
can get a little...

657
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,630
complicated.

658
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,381
Yeah, maybe, but I
don't think this is

659
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,967
one of those times.

660
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:31,510
It's pretty simple, Dad.

661
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,552
You're scared.

662
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,179
What do I have to be afraid of?

663
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:35,722
A lot.

664
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,850
Kasidy's willing to make
a major change in her life

665
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,685
just to be close to you.

666
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:41,102
If things don't work out,

667
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,980
you're going
to feel responsible,

668
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,606
and that's scary.

669
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:47,484
You figured out
all this by yourself?

670
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:49,862
Actually, I talked
with Nog about it.

671
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:55,033
You talked to Nog about
my relationship with Kasidy?

672
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,451
And we think

673
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,244
you have nothing to worry about.

674
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:02,081
If Kasidy wants to change jobs,
that's her decision, not yours.

675
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:04,668
Same thing if she wants to live
on the station.

676
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:08,547
If things don't work out,
they don't work out.

677
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:14,386
Have you told
any of this to Kasidy?

678
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:17,305
Nog and I thought about it,
but, uh...

679
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:20,017
we thought it would be better
if you told her yourself.

680
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,353
I see.

681
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,858
So, uh, what's new with you?

682
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:36,324
Take a look.

683
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,290
Breen?

684
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,292
What are they
doing here?

685
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:47,794
My tricorder's
picking up

686
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,797
a large concentration
of dilithium in the area.

687
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,883
They must be using

688
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:55,510
the survivors of the
<i>Ravinok</i> to mine the ore.

689
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,429
It makes perfect sense.

690
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:00,724
The Breen homeworld
is a frozen wasteland.

691
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:03,602
This place is about 50
degrees too hot for them.

692
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:07,480
You approve of
what they're doing?

693
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,608
No! Not at all.

694
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:12,861
I do admire
their ingenuity.

695
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,156
What is it?

696
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,001
It's her.

697
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:31,046
My daughter.

698
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:43,308
All right, we're going
to need some help.

699
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:46,311
I'm going to stay here
and keep an eye on things

700
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:48,480
while you go back to DS9
for reinforcements.

701
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,315
I have a better idea.

702
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:53,526
You go back to the station.
I'll stay here.

703
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,737
I'm sending you back, Dukat.
That's an order.

704
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:58,281
And I hate to refuse it,
but I'm afraid I must.

705
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:00,325
You're welcome to file
an official protest

706
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:03,453
with the Cardassian military
when we get back.

707
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:07,206
There's no way
I'm leaving you here alone.

708
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:09,042
Well...

709
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:11,878
then I suggest we devise a plan

710
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:15,256
to rescue
these prisoners together.

711
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:18,718
You need me, Major.

712
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,386
Maybe I do.

713
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:23,932
But if you hurt that girl...

714
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:27,769
I promise I'll kill you.

715
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,119
(<i> grunting</i> )

716
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:46,955
Don't make any noise.
We're here to help.

717
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:48,540
You're Bajoran!

718
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,666
Gather up as many prisoners
as you can.

719
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:51,043
Tell them to meet us here.

720
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:52,502
KIRA:
How many Breen guards
are there?

721
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:54,004
I'm not sure.

722
00:36:54,004 --> 00:36:56,173
There are always at least
eight in the mines.

723
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:57,256
How many prisoners?

724
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,884
There are only
31 of us left.

725
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:00,343
What about Lorit Akrem?
Did he make it?

726
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,929
He died in a cave-in
two years ago.

727
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,389
You knew him?

728
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,474
He was a friend.

729
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:09,519
My condolences, Major,
but we don't have time for this.

730
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:11,021
Tell me where I can find

731
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:12,022
Tora Ziyal?

732
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:13,065
Don't tell him anything.

733
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:14,399
He's a Cardassian.

734
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:15,650
I don't understand.

735
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,152
There's a peace treaty.

736
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:19,445
You mean the
occupation is over?

737
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:21,280
I need to find the girl!
Where is she?

738
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:34,252
Dukat!

739
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,686
Go get the rest
of the prisoners.

740
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,730
Meet me at the entrance
to the mine.

741
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:03,364
(<i> grunts</i> )

742
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:08,954
Where is Tora Ziyal?

743
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,767
Ziyal.

744
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,354
Father?

745
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,316
Oh, it's really you.

746
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,026
Mother said you'd...

747
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:46,866
Father, what's wrong?

748
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:50,120
KIRA:
Dukat, no!

749
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,164
I'm warning
you, Dukat.

750
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:53,665
Don't do it.

751
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,042
I have no choice.

752
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,836
There's always
a choice.

753
00:38:57,836 --> 00:39:00,172
You don't want to do this.

754
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:02,548
If you did, you never would
have told me about Ziyal.

755
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,926
Now put the rifle down.

756
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:06,928
No.

757
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:17,314
The Cardassian prisoners...

758
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:21,026
they told me this would happen.

759
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:23,569
That you'd never
let me go home,

760
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:26,531
but I-I-I didn't,
didn't believe them.

761
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:27,782
Ziyal, run!

762
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:38,417
I used to dream about you
coming to save me.

763
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,548
That's what kept me alive.

764
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,342
Ziyal...

765
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:57,395
If I can't be with you...

766
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:04,027
then I'd rather die.

767
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:13,328
(<i> sighs</i> )

768
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,501
Let's go home.

769
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,932
Kasidy Yates.

770
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:35,474
Hello, Ben.

771
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:37,476
Hold this a second.

772
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,603
About that job

773
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,688
with the Bajoran
Commerce Ministry...

774
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,899
You know someone
who's qualified for it?

775
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:46,485
I know someone who would
be perfect for it-- you.

776
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:49,155
I think you
should take the job.

777
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:52,033
I<i> want</i> you
to take the job.

778
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:55,036
You've been
talking to Jake.

779
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:56,079
How'd you know?

780
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,789
Oh, he's a smart boy.

781
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,540
Must take after
his mother.

782
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,089
I owe you an apology.

783
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:08,300
You came to tell me

784
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,592
all this wonderful news,

785
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:15,014
and all I could say was,
"It's a big step."

786
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,808
I don't know
what I was thinking.

787
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:19,144
Take a guess.

788
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,195
I wanted to tell you

789
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:32,115
how happy I was
for you... f-for us,

790
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:34,909
but it didn't
come out that way.

791
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:38,121
I...

792
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:44,043
I was uncomfortable
and a little nervous.

793
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:46,087
A<i> little</i> nervous?

794
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:50,467
All right.
A lot nervous.

795
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:59,100
I haven't been
in a serious relationship

796
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:02,061
for a long time,
and I didn't

797
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:04,439
expect to be in one
any time soon...

798
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:08,151
until I met you.

799
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:13,698
This life I lead...

800
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:16,368
this job I do...

801
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:20,205
that's what got
Jennifer killed.

802
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:25,502
If anything ever
happened to you...

803
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:29,672
Why not let me
worry about that?

804
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:32,717
That's what Jake said.

805
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:35,803
You see? Smart boy.

806
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:38,806
Look, I could stay here

807
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:41,518
and listen to you
apologize all day,

808
00:42:41,518 --> 00:42:43,061
but I've got
to get to Bajor.

809
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,312
Bajor?

810
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:45,397
I thought...

811
00:42:45,397 --> 00:42:47,690
Oh, I know
what you thought,

812
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,234
but I took the job.

813
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:52,778
Do you think I'd give
up a great opportunity

814
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,739
just because<i> you</i>
got cold feet?

815
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:59,118
You're a good man,
Benjamin Sisko,

816
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:01,329
but you've got a lot
to learn about women--

817
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:03,039
especially this one.

818
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:05,166
I'll see you
when I get back.

819
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:10,255
You can... help me
pick out quarters.

820
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:13,258
I'll be here.

821
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:25,270
DAX:
What was it like--

822
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:26,854
all that time
alone with Dukat?

823
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:29,065
I've had
better weeks,

824
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:31,192
but I'll never forget
the look on his face

825
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:33,278
when he sat on
that sand spine.

826
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:34,320
(<i> laughing</i> )

827
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,821
I wish I'd been there.

828
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:37,407
DUKAT:
Major.

829
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:38,950
Dukat.

830
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,034
Where's Ziyal?

831
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,911
Waiting for me
aboard my ship.

832
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:44,872
We'll be leaving
for Cardassia shortly.

833
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:48,751
I think I'll leave
the two of you alone.

834
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:54,048
I just wanted to say...
thank you, Major,

835
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,593
for a most
interesting journey.

836
00:43:56,593 --> 00:43:59,304
You're taking Ziyal back
to Cardassia with you.

837
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:03,641
After six years,
she deserves a home...

838
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,017
and a father.

839
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:07,562
Won't that make things
difficult for you?

840
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:13,526
(<i> sighs</i> )

841
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:15,820
I'll let you know.
