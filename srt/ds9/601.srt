1
00:00:05,975 --> 00:00:08,972
Last time on
<i>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine...</i>

2
00:00:09,017 --> 00:00:10,316
More Jem'Hadar ships

3
00:00:10,354 --> 00:00:11,756
come through the wormhole
every week.

4
00:00:11,791 --> 00:00:13,158
It must stop.

5
00:00:13,195 --> 00:00:14,391
It's going to stop.

6
00:00:14,432 --> 00:00:16,096
How do we keep them out?

7
00:00:16,137 --> 00:00:17,937
We're going to mine
the entrance to the wormhole.

8
00:00:17,975 --> 00:00:19,809
Prevent the Dominion
from bringing

9
00:00:19,847 --> 00:00:21,910
any more reinforcements
to Cardassia.

10
00:00:21,952 --> 00:00:23,547
Either you remove the mines

11
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,226
or we will take this station
from you...

12
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:29,136
and remove them ourselves.

13
00:00:31,814 --> 00:00:34,379
Mr. Worf, all weapons
fire at will.

14
00:00:42,477 --> 00:00:45,315
I've been waiting
for this moment for five years.

15
00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:54,770
We've lost main power
to the shields.

16
00:01:03,202 --> 00:01:04,832
What are your orders, Captain?

17
00:01:04,873 --> 00:01:06,868
We've done all we can here.

18
00:01:06,912 --> 00:01:10,479
Notify all remaining
Starfleet personnel.

19
00:01:10,522 --> 00:01:14,295
We're evacuating the station.

20
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:15,528
I heard you're not
coming with us...

21
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,063
that you've been assigned
to Martok's ship.

22
00:01:17,107 --> 00:01:19,637
It may be some time
before we see each other again.

23
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:21,515
Worf, we may never
see each other again.

24
00:01:25,798 --> 00:01:28,100
Dukat wanted the station back.

25
00:01:28,137 --> 00:01:29,869
He can have it.

26
00:01:38,902 --> 00:01:41,740
And now, the continuation.

27
00:02:05,308 --> 00:02:07,074
Cadet?

28
00:02:07,113 --> 00:02:09,814
Long-range scanners show
no sign of Jem'Hadar ships.

29
00:02:09,854 --> 00:02:12,190
Looks like they've broken off
the pursuit.

30
00:02:12,228 --> 00:02:15,397
I guess they got tired
of looking at our backs.

31
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,496
Three months of bloody slaughter

32
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:17,735
and what have we got
to show for it?

33
00:02:17,777 --> 00:02:18,837
Not a damned thing.

34
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,510
Engage, retreat,
engage, retreat.

35
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:21,884
Just once, I would've liked

36
00:02:21,921 --> 00:02:23,414
to have gotten
a look at their backs.

37
00:02:23,526 --> 00:02:24,893
Chief, that's enough.

38
00:02:24,929 --> 00:02:26,228
Sorry, sir.

39
00:02:26,267 --> 00:02:28,364
Nothing a little sleep
won't cure.

40
00:02:28,407 --> 00:02:30,811
We could all use some sleep.

41
00:02:30,846 --> 00:02:33,250
What has it been... 78 hours?

42
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,779
Shouldn't we have heard
something

43
00:02:34,824 --> 00:02:35,918
from the Seventh Fleet
by now?

44
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,658
I wouldn't worry just yet.

45
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,363
The Tyra system
is far enough away

46
00:02:39,403 --> 00:02:41,841
that it'll be a day or two
before we get any message.

47
00:02:41,877 --> 00:02:44,372
You think they could
stop the Dominion?

48
00:02:44,417 --> 00:02:45,944
Damn right they can.

49
00:02:45,988 --> 00:02:47,218
Somebody has to.

50
00:02:54,546 --> 00:02:55,776
Ah, there you are.

51
00:02:55,816 --> 00:02:58,619
I was beginning
to give up hope, Doctor.

52
00:02:58,657 --> 00:03:01,095
I would think that all
those lunches we've shared

53
00:03:01,131 --> 00:03:03,467
would have entitled me
to preferential treatment.

54
00:03:03,505 --> 00:03:06,274
Look, I have 12 wounded officers
and crewman out there

55
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:09,081
all of whom are in a lot
worse shape than you, Garak.

56
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,886
Well, if you're trying
to cheer me up

57
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:11,894
it's working.

58
00:03:11,928 --> 00:03:13,489
I feel better already.

59
00:03:13,566 --> 00:03:14,626
What happened?

60
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:17,302
I was studying some star charts
for Captain Sisko

61
00:03:17,343 --> 00:03:19,041
during the last assault,
when I had a sudden

62
00:03:19,081 --> 00:03:21,782
and rather violent encounter
with a bulkhead.

63
00:03:21,823 --> 00:03:23,384
You'll live.

64
00:03:23,427 --> 00:03:25,261
I wish I shared your confidence.

65
00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:27,635
I'm sure my head will heal

66
00:03:27,672 --> 00:03:29,267
but the way this war is going

67
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,307
I wouldn't bet on any of us
living to a ripe old age.

68
00:03:32,352 --> 00:03:34,917
I admit the odds are not good,
but they could be worse.

69
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,053
Ah, let me guess.

70
00:03:36,095 --> 00:03:38,567
You've used your
genetically enhanced brain

71
00:03:38,603 --> 00:03:40,905
to calculate
our chances for survival.

72
00:03:40,942 --> 00:03:42,344
It really wasn't that difficult.

73
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,816
I simply started
with a binomial...

74
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,415
I'm really not interested,
Doctor.

75
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,088
Ever since it's become
public knowledge

76
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:49,599
that you're
genetically engineered

77
00:03:49,667 --> 00:03:52,266
you've used every opportunity
to show off.

78
00:03:52,307 --> 00:03:53,709
I have nothing to hide anymore.

79
00:03:53,745 --> 00:03:55,842
I might as well use what I have.

80
00:03:55,884 --> 00:03:59,257
Well... what are our chances?

81
00:03:59,294 --> 00:04:00,263
Over 50 percent?

82
00:04:00,297 --> 00:04:02,428
32.7.

83
00:04:02,469 --> 00:04:03,939
I'm sorry I asked.

84
00:04:03,973 --> 00:04:05,910
You're certain
about that figure?

85
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:07,006
Do you want me to take you

86
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:08,576
through the entire set
of calculations?

87
00:04:08,687 --> 00:04:10,716
Not really.

88
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,856
"Genetically engineered,"
indeed.

89
00:04:12,898 --> 00:04:14,231
Excuse me?

90
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:15,295
Well, look at you.

91
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:18,177
You act as if you haven't
a care in the world.

92
00:04:18,213 --> 00:04:21,085
It's exactly that kind
of smug, superior attitude

93
00:04:21,121 --> 00:04:23,616
that makes people like
you so... unpopular.

94
00:04:23,662 --> 00:04:25,029
Are you trying to insult me?

95
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:27,537
"A 32.7 percent chance
of survival"...

96
00:04:27,573 --> 00:04:29,134
I call that insulting.

97
00:04:29,177 --> 00:04:31,240
Don't take it
so personally, Garak.

98
00:04:31,282 --> 00:04:33,082
It's strictly a matter
of mathematics.

99
00:04:33,122 --> 00:04:35,321
No. It's strictly
a matter of our lives.

100
00:04:35,361 --> 00:04:38,062
You're not genetically
engineered.

101
00:04:38,102 --> 00:04:40,097
You're a Vulcan.

102
00:04:40,141 --> 00:04:41,873
If I'm a Vulcan

103
00:04:41,913 --> 00:04:44,385
then how do you explain
my boyish smile?

104
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,793
Not so boyish anymore, Doctor.

105
00:04:49,634 --> 00:04:50,864
So where do you think

106
00:04:50,905 --> 00:04:52,603
Starfleet will be
sending us next?

107
00:04:52,643 --> 00:04:54,706
I don't know, but if I have
anything to say about the matter

108
00:04:54,782 --> 00:04:57,312
we'll be going right back
to the front lines.

109
00:04:57,355 --> 00:04:59,053
Well said, Captain

110
00:04:59,094 --> 00:05:01,624
and my ship
will be at your side.

111
00:05:03,372 --> 00:05:05,002
Worf!

112
00:05:07,718 --> 00:05:09,120
Tell her.

113
00:05:09,155 --> 00:05:10,785
Tell me what?

114
00:05:10,826 --> 00:05:13,230
It can wait.

115
00:05:13,267 --> 00:05:16,504
No! It cannot.

116
00:05:16,543 --> 00:05:18,036
<i>Raktajino.</i>

117
00:05:18,081 --> 00:05:20,646
It's been weighing heavily
on his mind.

118
00:05:21,824 --> 00:05:23,658
What is it, Worf?
What's wrong?

119
00:05:27,106 --> 00:05:29,271
It is about our wedding.

120
00:05:29,312 --> 00:05:32,081
You're getting cold feet?

121
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,685
You have scheduled
the ritual sacrifice of the <i>targ</i>

122
00:05:34,726 --> 00:05:37,198
to occur after the wedding feast
has been served.

123
00:05:37,234 --> 00:05:39,068
We haven't seen each other

124
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,908
for five weeks and that's
the first thing you say to me?

125
00:05:41,947 --> 00:05:45,651
We agreed it would be
a traditional ceremony.

126
00:05:48,131 --> 00:05:50,160
Okay. Have it your way.

127
00:05:51,273 --> 00:05:53,438
First, we'll shed blood,
and then we'll feast.

128
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:54,743
As it should be.

129
00:05:54,782 --> 00:05:59,728
He has been unable to talk
of anything else for days.

130
00:05:59,763 --> 00:06:02,430
He is such a worrier.

131
00:06:02,471 --> 00:06:03,497
Take it from me, old man...

132
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,910
a small wedding
is the way to go.

133
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,885
Well, you get married
the way you want

134
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,484
and I'll get married
the way I want.

135
00:06:10,527 --> 00:06:11,929
I'll see you later, Captain.

136
00:06:11,964 --> 00:06:13,993
Try not to break any bones.

137
00:06:17,513 --> 00:06:19,485
Now that that's settled

138
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,718
I'm going to take care of this.

139
00:06:21,758 --> 00:06:24,698
Klingons make great warriors,
but...

140
00:06:24,733 --> 00:06:26,226
terrible doctors.

141
00:06:26,271 --> 00:06:27,832
Captain...

142
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:29,345
Just the man I wanted to see.

143
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,411
We've been ordered
to report to Starbase 375

144
00:06:32,455 --> 00:06:33,685
for reassignment.

145
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:39,199
Something else, Doctor?

146
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,773
I have news
of the Seventh Fleet.

147
00:06:45,157 --> 00:06:47,254
Go on.

148
00:06:47,296 --> 00:06:49,359
Only 14 ships made it back
to our lines.

149
00:06:49,403 --> 00:06:52,640
Fourteen...
out of 112.

150
00:06:52,677 --> 00:06:55,115
We can't keep taking
these kinds of losses, sir

151
00:06:55,152 --> 00:06:56,314
not if we expect to win this.

152
00:06:56,355 --> 00:06:58,019
Thank you, Doctor.

153
00:06:58,059 --> 00:06:59,187
That will be all.

154
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,581
I'll take a look
at that arm now.

155
00:09:18,581 --> 00:09:24,086
Permanent Documentation File,
Dukat, S.G.

156
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,333
Each day brings reports
of new victories.

157
00:09:27,371 --> 00:09:29,605
The war continues to go well.

158
00:09:29,645 --> 00:09:32,483
The enemy is retreating.
On almost all fronts.

159
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:37,227
It's only a matter of time
before the Federation collapses

160
00:09:37,266 --> 00:09:39,865
and Earth becomes
another conquered planet

161
00:09:39,907 --> 00:09:42,106
under Dominion rule.

162
00:09:42,147 --> 00:09:46,683
All in all, it's a good time
for Cardassia.

163
00:09:46,726 --> 00:09:49,700
And the Dominion.

164
00:09:49,735 --> 00:09:52,573
My dear Major Kira,
you have no idea

165
00:09:52,609 --> 00:09:54,477
how it pleases me
to hear you say that.

166
00:09:54,514 --> 00:09:56,816
Dukat,
the Major has just given me

167
00:09:56,922 --> 00:09:58,186
the most wonderful news.

168
00:09:58,225 --> 00:10:01,256
Bajorans are returning
to the station.

169
00:10:02,938 --> 00:10:04,499
I'm well aware of it.

170
00:10:04,542 --> 00:10:06,410
Then I'm sure you share
my delight

171
00:10:06,448 --> 00:10:09,217
in knowing that life here
is returning to normal.

172
00:10:09,256 --> 00:10:10,726
The shops are reopening.

173
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:13,699
The Promenade is abuzz
with activity once again.

174
00:10:13,735 --> 00:10:15,171
The Habitat Ring echoes

175
00:10:15,205 --> 00:10:16,869
with the laughter
of happy children.

176
00:10:16,978 --> 00:10:19,314
I've doubled security patrols
throughout the station.

177
00:10:22,927 --> 00:10:26,563
Are such precautions
really necessary?

178
00:10:26,604 --> 00:10:30,046
I've found that one
can't be too careful

179
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,143
when dealing with the Bajorans.

180
00:10:32,186 --> 00:10:33,314
What's the matter, Dukat?

181
00:10:33,356 --> 00:10:35,624
Afraid we'll take the station
away from you again?

182
00:10:35,663 --> 00:10:37,794
You're welcome to try.

183
00:10:37,835 --> 00:10:38,861
Come now, come now.

184
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:41,173
There's no need
for this petty bickering.

185
00:10:41,211 --> 00:10:42,271
We're all friends here.

186
00:10:42,315 --> 00:10:43,341
Are we?

187
00:10:43,384 --> 00:10:45,686
Of course we are

188
00:10:45,724 --> 00:10:47,627
and if you have
any suggestions, Major

189
00:10:47,663 --> 00:10:49,965
feel free to bring them
to me at any time.

190
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,369
Fine.

191
00:10:51,406 --> 00:10:55,406
We'd like the station's Bajoran
security force reinstated.

192
00:10:55,452 --> 00:10:56,716
I suppose you want us

193
00:10:56,755 --> 00:10:58,989
to give them back
their weapons as well.

194
00:10:59,028 --> 00:11:01,159
That's right.

195
00:11:01,201 --> 00:11:05,771
The station no longer requires
a Bajoran security force.

196
00:11:05,813 --> 00:11:09,220
Our troops can handle
any problems that might arise.

197
00:11:09,256 --> 00:11:11,626
The Federation and Bajor
always shared

198
00:11:11,663 --> 00:11:14,364
equal responsibility
for station security.

199
00:11:14,405 --> 00:11:16,536
I thought you said
that we would have

200
00:11:16,577 --> 00:11:18,070
the same arrangement
with the Dominion.

201
00:11:18,114 --> 00:11:20,086
After all

202
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,524
we are all friends here...

203
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,996
aren't we?

204
00:11:24,098 --> 00:11:27,699
Perhaps you should
reconsider your decision.

205
00:11:27,742 --> 00:11:30,842
The order stands.

206
00:11:30,883 --> 00:11:34,917
You may trust
the Bajorans, but I don't

207
00:11:34,962 --> 00:11:37,834
and until they earn my trust

208
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,435
I prefer to keep them unarmed.

209
00:11:40,478 --> 00:11:41,971
And if you were in my position,
Major

210
00:11:42,014 --> 00:11:45,217
you would do
exactly the same thing.

211
00:11:47,196 --> 00:11:49,327
Perhaps it would be best

212
00:11:49,369 --> 00:11:50,896
to let the matter rest
for a while.

213
00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:53,469
I'm sure in time
we'll be able to resolve

214
00:11:53,514 --> 00:11:55,952
all these minor problems
to our mutual satisfaction.

215
00:11:55,987 --> 00:11:57,183
I'll remember you said that.

216
00:11:57,224 --> 00:11:58,751
I'm sure you will.

217
00:11:58,795 --> 00:11:59,889
One last thing...

218
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:02,899
Odo.

219
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,376
What about him?

220
00:12:06,082 --> 00:12:10,390
Is he aware
that I'm doing everything I can

221
00:12:10,427 --> 00:12:11,863
to strengthen the bond

222
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,770
between the Dominion
and the Bajoran people?

223
00:12:15,976 --> 00:12:17,879
Why don't you ask him
yourself?

224
00:12:17,915 --> 00:12:22,086
No, no. I wouldn't
want to bother him.

225
00:12:24,434 --> 00:12:25,836
Good day, Major.

226
00:12:33,425 --> 00:12:35,795
She's a fascinating woman,
isn't she?

227
00:12:35,832 --> 00:12:37,564
I wouldn't know...

228
00:12:37,603 --> 00:12:40,634
but I do know
we need her as an ally.

229
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:42,651
The Bajorans will never
be our allies.

230
00:12:42,684 --> 00:12:43,710
Out.

231
00:12:43,754 --> 00:12:45,156
Don't look at him.

232
00:12:45,225 --> 00:12:46,786
I'm telling you to leave.

233
00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:48,231
Now!

234
00:12:58,061 --> 00:13:00,033
I find him useful.

235
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:01,662
In the future...

236
00:13:02,841 --> 00:13:06,716
it might be prudent
for you to include me

237
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:10,250
in all decisions
regarding station policy.

238
00:13:11,498 --> 00:13:12,934
Now...

239
00:13:12,969 --> 00:13:15,271
what about the wormhole?

240
00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:17,406
You assured me
that you would be able

241
00:13:17,448 --> 00:13:19,282
to dismantle the minefield
within a month.

242
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,188
That was two months ago.

243
00:13:21,226 --> 00:13:22,320
Well, I admit

244
00:13:22,362 --> 00:13:26,362
the work is proceeding
more slowly than expected

245
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:29,904
but as you know,
these are not ordinary mines.

246
00:13:29,949 --> 00:13:33,722
Every time we deactivate
or destroy one of them

247
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,929
its neighbor replicates
a new one.

248
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,073
We have to take down
that minefield

249
00:13:41,114 --> 00:13:42,982
and reopen the wormhole.

250
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,492
And we will.

251
00:13:45,526 --> 00:13:48,091
But there's no need for panic.

252
00:13:48,134 --> 00:13:50,869
We are winning the war.

253
00:13:50,908 --> 00:13:54,281
For the moment, yes,
but to defeat the Federation

254
00:13:54,351 --> 00:13:55,753
we're going to need
reinforcements

255
00:13:55,789 --> 00:13:58,592
and new supplies
of ketracel-white...

256
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,032
soon.

257
00:14:00,067 --> 00:14:01,594
Weyoun...

258
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:07,484
I said I will deal
with the minefield

259
00:14:07,521 --> 00:14:10,016
and I will.

260
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:11,656
Hmm.

261
00:14:24,292 --> 00:14:26,264
Good evening, gentlemen.

262
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:29,831
Once again, I see
you're at your usual table.

263
00:14:29,874 --> 00:14:32,507
It's amazing
how many of my customers

264
00:14:32,549 --> 00:14:35,021
think of Quark's
as their second home.

265
00:14:35,055 --> 00:14:38,896
I only wish I had a holo-imager,
so I could preserve

266
00:14:38,933 --> 00:14:43,640
this warm and wonderful moment
of camaraderie.

267
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,920
Something you could hang
on the wall of your barracks.

268
00:14:50,499 --> 00:14:53,496
Have you tried the dabo tables?

269
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,012
I'm sure one
of my lovely hostesses

270
00:14:56,047 --> 00:14:59,751
would be happy
to teach you the game.

271
00:14:59,792 --> 00:15:01,729
I know...

272
00:15:01,763 --> 00:15:03,894
a complimentary hour

273
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:07,503
in one of our
state-of-the-art holosuites.

274
00:15:07,547 --> 00:15:09,951
Whatever your desires

275
00:15:09,986 --> 00:15:13,359
I'm sure we can satisfy them.

276
00:15:14,466 --> 00:15:16,096
Perhaps another time.

277
00:15:16,137 --> 00:15:17,504
Enjoy the evening.

278
00:15:20,483 --> 00:15:22,147
Tough crowd.

279
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,553
I'm telling you, Odo

280
00:15:23,591 --> 00:15:26,063
Dukat has only one thing
on his mind

281
00:15:26,098 --> 00:15:27,294
and that's revenge.

282
00:15:27,335 --> 00:15:30,606
He can't stand the thought
that Bajor defeated Cardassia.

283
00:15:30,644 --> 00:15:33,379
You think he wants
to reopen the labor camps?

284
00:15:33,418 --> 00:15:34,979
Oh, eventually.

285
00:15:35,023 --> 00:15:37,963
Well, then, I suppose
we should be grateful

286
00:15:37,998 --> 00:15:41,132
that he has Weyoun
looking over his shoulder.

287
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:42,369
Maybe.

288
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,439
Weyoun's a hard one
to figure out.

289
00:15:44,483 --> 00:15:46,887
I don't really trust him, but...

290
00:15:46,923 --> 00:15:49,989
I trust him more than Dukat.

291
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:54,135
Weyoun knows that it's
in the Dominion's best interest

292
00:15:54,176 --> 00:15:56,341
to honor its treaty with Bajor.

293
00:15:56,382 --> 00:15:59,824
They want to prove to the rest
of the Alpha Quadrant

294
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:01,831
that they're true to their word.

295
00:16:01,864 --> 00:16:03,836
Weyoun asked me about you.

296
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,708
He seemed very concerned
about what you thought of him.

297
00:16:07,982 --> 00:16:10,785
I try not to think of him.

298
00:16:10,823 --> 00:16:13,227
He'd be hurt to hear
you say that.

299
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,735
I'll have to mention it
to him.

300
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:21,584
I'm glad you can still smile.

301
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,150
Ah, only when I'm with you.

302
00:16:24,193 --> 00:16:25,595
That's kind of you to say.

303
00:16:25,631 --> 00:16:27,397
No, it's true.

304
00:16:27,436 --> 00:16:30,308
When I talk to you,
things don't seem as bad.

305
00:16:31,313 --> 00:16:34,811
When I think of Dukat
in the Captain's office

306
00:16:34,857 --> 00:16:38,299
or the fact that the Federation
seems to be losing this war

307
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,702
and we're sitting here
doing nothing...

308
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,110
I share your frustration, Major,
but right now

309
00:16:43,146 --> 00:16:45,711
there's really nothing we can do
but bide our time.

310
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:49,321
It's like Captain Sisko said...
Bajor must be kept

311
00:16:49,364 --> 00:16:51,666
out of the fighting.

312
00:16:51,704 --> 00:16:54,337
And who am I to argue
with the Emissary?

313
00:16:54,378 --> 00:16:55,642
Thanks for waiting.

314
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,485
Things have been
a little busier than expected.

315
00:16:58,523 --> 00:17:01,395
This one's on the house.

316
00:17:02,501 --> 00:17:04,165
What do you want, Quark?

317
00:17:04,205 --> 00:17:07,669
The usual...
peace, love and understanding.

318
00:17:07,716 --> 00:17:11,420
Not to mention
a generous profit margin

319
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:14,194
which, I'm happy to say,
is looking more and more likely.

320
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:18,199
You know, I never
expected to say this

321
00:17:18,244 --> 00:17:22,518
but as occupations go,
this one's not so bad.

322
00:17:22,557 --> 00:17:23,821
No, I suppose that's true

323
00:17:23,861 --> 00:17:26,767
if all you're worried about
is a monthly balance sheet.

324
00:17:26,802 --> 00:17:30,005
I'm not just concerned
with profit, Major.

325
00:17:31,281 --> 00:17:33,149
Look around.

326
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:36,126
Do you see any ghetto fences
dividing the Promenade?

327
00:17:36,162 --> 00:17:38,863
Or exhausted
Bajoran slave laborers

328
00:17:38,903 --> 00:17:40,898
sprawled on the ground
after a grueling day

329
00:17:40,941 --> 00:17:42,308
in the ore-processing
center?

330
00:17:42,346 --> 00:17:44,750
Do you hear
the cries of starving children?

331
00:17:44,785 --> 00:17:45,811
I don't.

332
00:17:45,855 --> 00:17:47,758
Now don't get me wrong.

333
00:17:47,794 --> 00:17:50,632
I miss the Federation, too.

334
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:53,735
All I'm saying is

335
00:17:53,777 --> 00:17:56,444
things could be a lot worse.

336
00:18:00,797 --> 00:18:03,931
I hate to say this,
but he's right.

337
00:18:03,973 --> 00:18:06,343
The Dominion seems
determined to prove

338
00:18:06,379 --> 00:18:08,783
that it can be
a friend to Bajor.

339
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,553
If it's such a good friend

340
00:18:11,593 --> 00:18:15,434
why are there
no Bajoran security officers

341
00:18:15,538 --> 00:18:17,031
on the station?

342
00:18:31,282 --> 00:18:34,017
I'm glad you made it back
in one piece, Ben.

343
00:18:34,057 --> 00:18:35,287
I was lucky.

344
00:18:35,327 --> 00:18:37,127
We lost a lot of good people.

345
00:18:37,165 --> 00:18:38,327
Yes, we did

346
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,636
and we're going
to lose a lot more

347
00:18:40,675 --> 00:18:42,270
before this is over.

348
00:18:44,285 --> 00:18:46,621
I hope you'll find
this office satisfactory.

349
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:47,957
Office?

350
00:18:47,996 --> 00:18:49,489
I wasn't aware
I'd be needing an office.

351
00:18:49,534 --> 00:18:51,402
I thought I was here
for an assignment briefing.

352
00:18:51,439 --> 00:18:52,932
I'm afraid
you're going to be here

353
00:18:52,976 --> 00:18:54,810
for a lot longer
than you think, Captain.

354
00:18:54,848 --> 00:18:56,546
As of right now,
you're no longer

355
00:18:56,586 --> 00:18:58,022
in command of the <i>Defiant.</i>

356
00:19:08,264 --> 00:19:10,327
Relieved of command?

357
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:11,339
Why?

358
00:19:11,373 --> 00:19:13,470
Admiral Ross didn't say.

359
00:19:14,749 --> 00:19:16,686
He did say we'll be getting

360
00:19:16,721 --> 00:19:19,125
our new assignment
at 1600 hours.

361
00:19:19,162 --> 00:19:22,626
Well, at least the crew
is staying together.

362
00:19:24,176 --> 00:19:26,478
We are staying together,
aren't we?

363
00:19:26,515 --> 00:19:27,814
You can count on it.

364
00:19:30,259 --> 00:19:33,199
So what do you plan on doing
the next couple of hours?

365
00:19:33,234 --> 00:19:35,764
I haven't given
it much thought.

366
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,608
Maybe now would be
a good time

367
00:19:37,646 --> 00:19:39,412
to contact your father.

368
00:19:41,824 --> 00:19:43,385
Maybe.

369
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,834
Benjamin, you haven't
spoken to him for months

370
00:19:48,878 --> 00:19:50,873
and Jake is his grandson.

371
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:53,013
How do I explain

372
00:19:53,056 --> 00:19:55,655
that I evacuated
every Federation citizen

373
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:59,160
off Deep Space 9
except his grandson?

374
00:19:59,207 --> 00:20:00,905
You'll think of something.

375
00:20:01,012 --> 00:20:03,884
You always do.

376
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,447
You did what?

377
00:20:05,491 --> 00:20:07,929
Dad, it's not quite
as bad as it sounds.

378
00:20:07,997 --> 00:20:10,435
You mean, you didn't leave
my grandson

379
00:20:10,472 --> 00:20:13,207
at the mercy of a vicious,
bloodthirsty enemy?

380
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:16,415
Well... no.

381
00:20:16,455 --> 00:20:18,392
I did.

382
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:21,527
Then it's certainly
just as bad as it sounds.

383
00:20:21,569 --> 00:20:23,403
Dad, it was not my decision.

384
00:20:23,441 --> 00:20:25,504
It was Jake's choice
to stay behind.

385
00:20:25,547 --> 00:20:28,316
Oh, so now you're going
to blame this on Jake.

386
00:20:28,355 --> 00:20:29,985
I'm not blaming Jake.

387
00:20:30,093 --> 00:20:31,757
He's not a child anymore.

388
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:34,099
He's responsible
for his own actions.

389
00:20:34,137 --> 00:20:35,869
I don't care who's responsible.

390
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,813
It's wrong, and I want him back.

391
00:20:37,848 --> 00:20:39,580
And so do I.

392
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,170
Do you think he's all right?

393
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:48,141
I hope so.

394
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:51,977
I'll bring him back, Dad.

395
00:20:52,021 --> 00:20:53,491
I promise.

396
00:20:53,525 --> 00:20:54,516
When?

397
00:20:54,561 --> 00:20:55,791
That I don't know.

398
00:20:55,831 --> 00:20:56,925
It might be a while.

399
00:20:56,968 --> 00:20:58,301
I'm about to be given new orders

400
00:20:58,339 --> 00:21:00,276
and I don't know
where they're going to send me.

401
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,475
Tell them
you want to go get your son.

402
00:21:02,516 --> 00:21:03,485
It's wartime.

403
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:05,491
It's not up to me.
I go where I'm sent.

404
00:21:10,673 --> 00:21:13,203
How's the restaurant doing?

405
00:21:13,247 --> 00:21:14,877
All right.

406
00:21:14,918 --> 00:21:18,257
It's been three weeks
since I poisoned anyone.

407
00:21:18,294 --> 00:21:23,070
Are things really as bad
as the news service claims?

408
00:21:23,107 --> 00:21:25,044
Maybe worse.

409
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,750
Well, you certainly know how
to comfort a frightened old man.

410
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:31,059
You didn't raise me
to be a liar.

411
00:21:31,097 --> 00:21:34,197
I raised you to be a chef,
for all the good it did me.

412
00:21:34,238 --> 00:21:37,235
You know, there's something
I just don't understand.

413
00:21:37,281 --> 00:21:41,418
You're always telling me
that space is big

414
00:21:41,459 --> 00:21:45,630
that it's an endless frontier
filled with infinite wonders.

415
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:46,605
It's true.

416
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,609
Well, if that's the case

417
00:21:47,643 --> 00:21:49,375
you would think it would be...

418
00:21:49,415 --> 00:21:50,817
more than enough room

419
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:53,587
to allow people
to leave each other alone.

420
00:21:55,097 --> 00:21:58,037
It just doesn't work that way.

421
00:21:58,072 --> 00:22:00,978
It should, but it doesn't.

422
00:22:03,052 --> 00:22:04,545
I better be going.

423
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,220
The lunch crowd's coming in.

424
00:22:08,701 --> 00:22:11,641
You watch yourself, Ben...

425
00:22:11,677 --> 00:22:14,846
and bring me back my grandson.

426
00:22:14,885 --> 00:22:16,549
I will.

427
00:22:16,591 --> 00:22:19,394
I love you.

428
00:22:19,432 --> 00:22:21,164
I love you, too.

429
00:22:24,312 --> 00:22:25,303
Hello.

430
00:22:27,421 --> 00:22:29,187
Excuse me, Mr. Weyoun.

431
00:22:29,226 --> 00:22:31,357
Oh... please.

432
00:22:31,398 --> 00:22:33,529
Uh, I prefer just, uh... Weyoun.

433
00:22:33,571 --> 00:22:37,069
That's the kind of detail
people like to know.

434
00:22:37,114 --> 00:22:38,607
Ah, would this be a good time?

435
00:22:38,652 --> 00:22:39,621
For what?

436
00:22:39,655 --> 00:22:40,954
For the interview
we talked about...

437
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:42,690
you know, for the
Federation News Service.

438
00:22:42,731 --> 00:22:45,226
Oh, ho, I'm afraid that
will be quite impossible.

439
00:22:45,304 --> 00:22:46,432
Why?

440
00:22:46,474 --> 00:22:48,342
Because I've read
your previous articles

441
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,784
and they left me with
one inescapable conclusion...

442
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:53,486
you are biased
against the Dominion.

443
00:22:53,527 --> 00:22:55,259
What-what gave you that idea?

444
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:56,562
You keep referring to us

445
00:22:56,602 --> 00:23:00,409
as the station's
"occupying force."

446
00:23:00,446 --> 00:23:01,415
What's wrong with that?

447
00:23:01,449 --> 00:23:04,014
It has a negative connotation.

448
00:23:04,057 --> 00:23:08,091
All your articles are filled
with pejorative terminology

449
00:23:08,134 --> 00:23:11,541
which is why I've been forced
to withhold their transmission.

450
00:23:11,577 --> 00:23:12,944
Are you telling me that no one

451
00:23:12,982 --> 00:23:14,646
from the Federation
read my reports?

452
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:16,247
If I don't send them,
they don't read them.

453
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:17,624
What about freedom of the press?

454
00:23:17,661 --> 00:23:21,194
Please tell me
you're not that naive.

455
00:23:21,238 --> 00:23:25,113
The only reason I stayed here
was to report on the occupation.

456
00:23:25,149 --> 00:23:26,619
You see, there you go again.

457
00:23:26,652 --> 00:23:29,217
This is not an occupation.

458
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,732
This is a Cardassian
station, Jake

459
00:23:31,768 --> 00:23:33,295
and I'm sure you're aware

460
00:23:33,338 --> 00:23:35,206
there are no Dominion troops
on Bajor.

461
00:23:35,244 --> 00:23:36,213
Why should there be?

462
00:23:36,247 --> 00:23:37,307
We have a treaty with them.

463
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,341
They're our friends.

464
00:23:40,091 --> 00:23:41,287
All right.
I'm sorry.

465
00:23:41,327 --> 00:23:43,025
I didn't mean anything by it.

466
00:23:43,066 --> 00:23:44,160
If you want me

467
00:23:44,202 --> 00:23:46,197
to send your articles
to the Federation

468
00:23:46,241 --> 00:23:50,116
you're going to have to provide
a more balanced perspective.

469
00:23:50,152 --> 00:23:52,590
I won't write
Dominion propaganda.

470
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:54,859
I would never dream
of asking you to.

471
00:23:54,898 --> 00:23:58,966
All I want is for you
to keep an open mind.

472
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,377
All right.
My mind is open.

473
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:02,179
Now can we do the interview?

474
00:24:04,492 --> 00:24:06,122
All in good time.

475
00:24:06,163 --> 00:24:08,135
You keep writing.
I'll keep reading.

476
00:24:08,169 --> 00:24:09,331
Let's leave it at that for now.

477
00:24:09,439 --> 00:24:12,038
Good day, Jake.

478
00:24:19,879 --> 00:24:21,782
Starfleet Intelligence
has discovered

479
00:24:21,819 --> 00:24:24,554
what we believe to be
their main storage facility

480
00:24:24,593 --> 00:24:26,997
for ketracel-white
in the Alpha Quadrant...

481
00:24:27,033 --> 00:24:29,164
right here,
deep in Cardassian space.

482
00:24:29,206 --> 00:24:30,836
We need to destroy it.

483
00:24:30,944 --> 00:24:32,847
Without the white
to sustain them

484
00:24:32,882 --> 00:24:35,081
the Jem'Hadar
won't be able to function.

485
00:24:35,121 --> 00:24:37,355
Without the white,
the Jem'Hadar will die.

486
00:24:37,395 --> 00:24:38,865
I won't shed any tears

487
00:24:38,966 --> 00:24:40,834
not if it
helps end this war.

488
00:24:40,872 --> 00:24:45,043
It may be our only way to end
this war, short of surrendering.

489
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:47,852
How do you expect us to
infiltrate Cardassian territory

490
00:24:47,891 --> 00:24:50,261
without the <i>Defiant</i>
and its cloaking abilities?

491
00:24:50,298 --> 00:24:52,395
I was wondering the same thing.

492
00:24:52,437 --> 00:24:54,271
You won't need
a cloaking device.

493
00:24:54,309 --> 00:24:56,143
We have something even better.

494
00:25:00,626 --> 00:25:02,860
A Jem'Hadar attack ship.

495
00:25:02,933 --> 00:25:05,634
It's the one you captured
last year, Captain.

496
00:25:05,674 --> 00:25:08,341
Now you get a chance
to see what it can do.

497
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:10,751
Do you even know
how to fly that thing?

498
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:14,960
Not yet, but I intend to learn.

499
00:25:25,663 --> 00:25:27,760
Guidance matrix, check.

500
00:25:27,802 --> 00:25:31,802
Aft parabolic thrusters, check.

501
00:25:31,847 --> 00:25:33,613
Sensor feed, check.

502
00:25:33,652 --> 00:25:35,350
Chief.

503
00:25:35,391 --> 00:25:37,191
Reactor core, check.

504
00:25:37,229 --> 00:25:40,169
Induction stabilizers, check.

505
00:25:40,203 --> 00:25:41,696
Phaser coils, check.

506
00:25:41,741 --> 00:25:42,869
Nog.

507
00:25:42,911 --> 00:25:44,643
Resonance emitters, check.

508
00:25:44,682 --> 00:25:46,380
Subspace field grid, check.

509
00:25:46,422 --> 00:25:49,260
Signal subprocessors, check.

510
00:25:49,296 --> 00:25:50,663
I think.

511
00:25:50,699 --> 00:25:51,998
You think?

512
00:25:52,037 --> 00:25:53,336
We've been training
on this ship

513
00:25:53,374 --> 00:25:54,536
for two weeks now.

514
00:25:54,577 --> 00:25:56,742
I would like to put a Jem'Hadar
soldier on the <i>Defiant</i>

515
00:25:56,783 --> 00:25:58,880
and see how well he does
after two weeks.

516
00:25:58,923 --> 00:26:01,418
These controls
are very... different.

517
00:26:01,464 --> 00:26:03,264
They take time to get used to.

518
00:26:03,302 --> 00:26:04,932
We don't have any more time.

519
00:26:04,973 --> 00:26:07,138
We're about to take this ship
into enemy territory.

520
00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:08,581
We don't want any slip-ups.

521
00:26:08,616 --> 00:26:10,781
I don't intend
to make any, Chief.

522
00:26:10,822 --> 00:26:12,554
Good.

523
00:26:12,595 --> 00:26:13,997
I still don't see
why we couldn't install

524
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:15,227
a few chairs on the Bridge.

525
00:26:15,268 --> 00:26:17,467
Because this ship
wasn't designed for chairs.

526
00:26:17,508 --> 00:26:18,944
Well, my feet aren't designed

527
00:26:18,979 --> 00:26:20,916
to stand
for long periods of time.

528
00:26:20,951 --> 00:26:22,387
They get tired.

529
00:26:22,421 --> 00:26:23,823
Maybe we should
leave you behind.

530
00:26:23,859 --> 00:26:26,526
My feet might like that,
but I wouldn't.

531
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:29,039
It's not your feet
you need to worry about.

532
00:26:29,107 --> 00:26:30,041
It's your stomach.

533
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,443
Have you noticed?

534
00:26:31,481 --> 00:26:33,145
There isn't
a single food replicator

535
00:26:33,186 --> 00:26:34,918
anywhere on this ship.

536
00:26:34,957 --> 00:26:37,054
That shouldn't be a problem.

537
00:26:37,163 --> 00:26:38,223
Captain Sisko says
there'll be

538
00:26:38,266 --> 00:26:39,530
plenty of field rations.

539
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:42,042
Trying eating field rations
for three weeks

540
00:26:42,077 --> 00:26:43,410
and then tell me
it isn't a problem.

541
00:26:43,447 --> 00:26:44,711
You know what is a problem?

542
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,049
No viewscreen.

543
00:26:46,088 --> 00:26:48,083
Who builds a Bridge
without a window?

544
00:26:48,126 --> 00:26:50,793
The same people who build a ship
without an Infirmary.

545
00:26:50,834 --> 00:26:53,204
Here's a list of all the medical
supplies I brought on board.

546
00:26:53,242 --> 00:26:55,977
They're in my quarters,
for want of a better space.

547
00:26:56,016 --> 00:26:56,985
Well, don't worry.

548
00:26:57,018 --> 00:26:59,388
We'll try not to have
any medical emergencies

549
00:26:59,425 --> 00:27:00,918
while you're sleeping.

550
00:27:00,962 --> 00:27:02,261
I'm so glad that you find

551
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:05,240
the lack of proper
medical facilities amusing

552
00:27:05,275 --> 00:27:07,075
but if trouble breaks out

553
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:10,884
it's not a viewscreen
or a chair or even a sandwich

554
00:27:10,923 --> 00:27:12,325
you'll be wanting.

555
00:27:12,361 --> 00:27:13,421
It's a bio-bed

556
00:27:13,464 --> 00:27:15,367
with a surgical
tissue regenerator.

557
00:27:15,403 --> 00:27:16,565
Maybe, but right now

558
00:27:16,607 --> 00:27:18,909
I would settle
for a viewscreen.

559
00:27:18,946 --> 00:27:19,812
Or a chair.

560
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:21,181
Or a sandwich.

561
00:27:24,862 --> 00:27:26,696
All right, people,
prepare for departure.

562
00:27:26,735 --> 00:27:28,228
All systems ready, sir.

563
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:30,245
Garak, come to see us off?

564
00:27:30,278 --> 00:27:31,247
Uh, not quite.

565
00:27:31,281 --> 00:27:32,683
I invited Mr. Garak
to join us.

566
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:34,987
Considering we're heading
into Cardassian territory

567
00:27:35,025 --> 00:27:36,689
I thought
he might prove useful.

568
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,029
Well, it's been
known to happen.

569
00:27:39,036 --> 00:27:40,232
Pull up a chair.

570
00:27:41,977 --> 00:27:43,139
We're cleared for departure,
sir.

571
00:27:47,927 --> 00:27:49,864
Take us out, old man.

572
00:27:49,899 --> 00:27:51,198
Aye, Captain.

573
00:27:51,237 --> 00:27:52,832
Aft thrusters at one-half.

574
00:27:56,217 --> 00:27:58,280
Bring us about.

575
00:28:04,173 --> 00:28:05,540
Just wanted
to make sure

576
00:28:05,577 --> 00:28:07,275
everyone was awake.

577
00:28:08,752 --> 00:28:10,051
We are now.

578
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:13,428
Just take it nice and easy,
all right?

579
00:28:13,466 --> 00:28:14,765
I can try.

580
00:28:14,802 --> 00:28:16,568
Set a course

581
00:28:16,607 --> 00:28:20,380
for the Cardassian border,
heading 054 mark 093.

582
00:28:20,418 --> 00:28:21,717
Warp six.

583
00:28:21,755 --> 00:28:22,917
Yes, sir.

584
00:28:36,485 --> 00:28:37,955
Come in.

585
00:28:39,727 --> 00:28:41,163
You wanted to see me?

586
00:28:41,199 --> 00:28:44,903
I always want to see you, Major

587
00:28:45,008 --> 00:28:47,641
and therein lies the problem.

588
00:28:47,683 --> 00:28:51,090
It's been three months
since my return to this station

589
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:54,898
and you and I have barely spent
any time with one another.

590
00:28:54,936 --> 00:28:56,908
Oh, I know you could point out

591
00:28:56,942 --> 00:28:59,414
the various meetings
we've attended together

592
00:28:59,449 --> 00:29:02,082
but... they never seem
to offer us

593
00:29:02,123 --> 00:29:06,226
the opportunity to venture
beyond station business.

594
00:29:06,269 --> 00:29:08,103
I don't have time for this.

595
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,131
Major!

596
00:29:13,054 --> 00:29:16,393
I haven't dismissed you yet.

597
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:20,396
What do you want from me, Dukat?

598
00:29:22,012 --> 00:29:23,482
Come now, Major.

599
00:29:23,517 --> 00:29:27,392
Have the last three months
been that bad?

600
00:29:27,428 --> 00:29:29,400
Is that what you want?

601
00:29:29,433 --> 00:29:31,165
Is that why I'm here?

602
00:29:31,204 --> 00:29:32,834
To flatter you?

603
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:35,610
To tell you what a good job
you've done

604
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:38,180
and how happy we all are
to have you back?

605
00:29:38,224 --> 00:29:41,198
Sarcasm doesn't become you,
Major.

606
00:29:41,232 --> 00:29:43,704
It's your directness

607
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,543
that I've always found
most appealing.

608
00:29:46,581 --> 00:29:48,553
Dukat, I got better things
to do

609
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:50,889
than to stand around
and help you play out

610
00:29:50,926 --> 00:29:52,624
one of your little fantasies.

611
00:29:55,406 --> 00:29:58,175
You feel I've betrayed you.

612
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,580
Not just me.

613
00:29:59,617 --> 00:30:01,589
Everyone.

614
00:30:01,623 --> 00:30:03,253
Even your own people.

615
00:30:06,637 --> 00:30:13,555
Cardassia was on the edge
of an abyss, Major.

616
00:30:15,662 --> 00:30:20,631
The war with the Klingons
left us a third-rate power.

617
00:30:20,676 --> 00:30:22,648
My people had lost their way.

618
00:30:22,682 --> 00:30:24,984
I've made them strong again.

619
00:30:25,021 --> 00:30:26,251
At what price?

620
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:28,593
You sold Cardassia
to the Dominion.

621
00:30:28,632 --> 00:30:29,999
Yes...

622
00:30:30,035 --> 00:30:32,873
a high price, to be sure

623
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:36,910
but look what we're getting
in return.

624
00:30:36,955 --> 00:30:39,929
The Alpha Quadrant itself.

625
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:42,162
We'll see about that.

626
00:30:42,203 --> 00:30:45,701
Yes, we will.

627
00:30:45,746 --> 00:30:52,288
Oh... I could make things very
pleasant for you here, Kira.

628
00:30:52,331 --> 00:30:56,365
You could start by doing
something about your breath.

629
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:00,520
I'm a patient man.

630
00:31:00,554 --> 00:31:02,388
I can wait.

631
00:31:02,426 --> 00:31:04,523
Wait for what?

632
00:31:04,565 --> 00:31:07,368
What do you think
is going to happen here, Dukat?

633
00:31:07,406 --> 00:31:09,674
That you're going
to wear me down

634
00:31:09,713 --> 00:31:11,411
with your charming personality?

635
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:13,389
That I'm going
to be swept off my feet

636
00:31:13,423 --> 00:31:14,859
by that insincere smile?

637
00:31:14,894 --> 00:31:18,199
Are you really so deluded
that you actually believe

638
00:31:18,304 --> 00:31:19,204
that we're going to have

639
00:31:19,307 --> 00:31:20,606
some kind
of intimate relationship?

640
00:31:20,644 --> 00:31:24,417
Oh, we already do.

641
00:31:35,151 --> 00:31:36,484
Good day, Major.

642
00:31:38,326 --> 00:31:40,993
I have work to do.

643
00:32:05,068 --> 00:32:06,538
There.

644
00:32:06,572 --> 00:32:07,871
I wish I had more time

645
00:32:07,909 --> 00:32:10,108
to study the side effects
of wearing that headset.

646
00:32:10,149 --> 00:32:12,280
At least we know one
side effect... headaches.

647
00:32:12,355 --> 00:32:13,517
Well, the headsets
were designed

648
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:15,655
to be worn by the Vorta and
the Jem'Hadar, not humans.

649
00:32:15,697 --> 00:32:17,292
Captain, may I make
a suggestion?

650
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:19,032
Only if you talk softly.

651
00:32:19,073 --> 00:32:20,566
- We saw Dukat...
- Shh.

652
00:32:20,611 --> 00:32:22,013
Wearing one of these headsets

653
00:32:22,048 --> 00:32:24,020
during the attack
on Deep Space 9.

654
00:32:24,054 --> 00:32:28,088
Perhaps Cardassian physiology
is more compatible.

655
00:32:28,132 --> 00:32:29,192
Are you volunteering?

656
00:32:29,235 --> 00:32:30,568
I suppose I am.

657
00:32:30,606 --> 00:32:32,635
This ship is equipped
with two of them.

658
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:35,312
If I wore one,
then you wouldn't have to.

659
00:32:35,352 --> 00:32:37,255
At least, not all the time.

660
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:38,886
I agree with Garak, Captain.

661
00:32:38,929 --> 00:32:40,456
The less you wear it,
the better.

662
00:32:43,241 --> 00:32:44,574
Garak.

663
00:32:47,921 --> 00:32:49,687
Ah, it's like having
a viewscreen

664
00:32:49,726 --> 00:32:50,717
inside your brain.

665
00:32:51,765 --> 00:32:53,064
Sir...

666
00:32:53,102 --> 00:32:56,407
there's a Federation ship
off our starboard bow

667
00:32:56,511 --> 00:32:59,816
bearing 157 mark 095.

668
00:32:59,854 --> 00:33:01,791
It's the USS <i>Centaur.</i>

669
00:33:01,826 --> 00:33:03,193
That's Charlie Reynolds' ship.

670
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,529
I see it.

671
00:33:06,606 --> 00:33:07,369
Ah.

672
00:33:13,426 --> 00:33:15,694
Cadet, open a channel
to the <i>Centaur.</i>

673
00:33:15,732 --> 00:33:17,362
I can't.
Our com system's down.

674
00:33:17,403 --> 00:33:19,398
Perhaps we should consider
returning fire.

675
00:33:19,476 --> 00:33:21,106
We can't do that.
They're Starfleet.

676
00:33:23,286 --> 00:33:25,690
Well, you tell them, not us.

677
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,429
We better do something.

678
00:33:28,468 --> 00:33:31,169
Dax, get us
across the border, maximum warp.

679
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:33,704
I hope Charlie Reynolds
knows better

680
00:33:33,749 --> 00:33:35,481
than to follow us
into Dominion territory.

681
00:33:41,738 --> 00:33:43,436
How long before we
cross the border?

682
00:33:43,476 --> 00:33:45,276
We just did.

683
00:33:47,186 --> 00:33:48,485
The <i>Centaur's</i> still with us.

684
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,493
Charlie never did know
when to quit.

685
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:51,690
I hope he knows
what he's doing.

686
00:33:51,733 --> 00:33:53,206
The question is:
Do we know what we're doing?

687
00:33:54,576 --> 00:33:55,704
Captain, that last hit

688
00:33:55,746 --> 00:33:57,741
damaged one of our
guidance thrusters.

689
00:33:57,784 --> 00:33:59,379
Drop us out of warp.

690
00:33:59,422 --> 00:34:01,690
Come about.
Prepare to return fire.

691
00:34:05,004 --> 00:34:06,234
Yes, sir.

692
00:34:06,275 --> 00:34:08,942
The <i>Centaur</i> has dropped
out of warp.

693
00:34:10,988 --> 00:34:13,290
Target their weapons array.

694
00:34:13,328 --> 00:34:14,730
Avoid their engines.

695
00:34:14,765 --> 00:34:16,737
I don't want to leave
Charlie out here stranded

696
00:34:16,771 --> 00:34:18,469
on the wrong side
of the border.

697
00:34:24,525 --> 00:34:26,018
We're coming about
for another pass.

698
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:29,129
Charlie likes to swing
for the fences so stay in tight.

699
00:34:29,172 --> 00:34:30,699
Attack pattern omega.

700
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:42,903
The <i>Centaur</i>
is going into warp.

701
00:34:42,944 --> 00:34:45,577
They're heading back
to Federation space.

702
00:34:45,618 --> 00:34:47,020
Yes.

703
00:34:47,055 --> 00:34:48,616
Nice work, Chief.

704
00:34:48,727 --> 00:34:51,861
I didn't know
I'd scored a direct hit.

705
00:34:51,903 --> 00:34:53,065
Maybe you didn't.

706
00:34:53,106 --> 00:34:55,544
I'm picking up three Jem'Hadar
ships headed this way.

707
00:34:55,579 --> 00:34:57,608
He must have seen them.

708
00:35:01,663 --> 00:35:03,030
They went right by us.

709
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:05,597
Without even bothering
to say hello.

710
00:35:05,674 --> 00:35:07,703
They're too busy
chasing the <i>Centaur.</i>

711
00:35:07,746 --> 00:35:09,809
Do you think Reynolds
will outrun them?

712
00:35:09,853 --> 00:35:12,155
Charlie's been
in tight spots before.

713
00:35:12,192 --> 00:35:13,388
He'll make it.

714
00:35:13,429 --> 00:35:14,831
I wish we could help.

715
00:35:14,867 --> 00:35:16,497
We can't.

716
00:35:16,538 --> 00:35:19,604
Chief, get our com system
back on line.

717
00:35:19,647 --> 00:35:21,812
Return to course.

718
00:35:21,852 --> 00:35:24,655
Warp seven.

719
00:35:24,694 --> 00:35:25,822
Yes, sir.

720
00:35:32,449 --> 00:35:33,349
You should have seen

721
00:35:33,385 --> 00:35:34,821
the arrogant, smug look
on his face.

722
00:35:34,856 --> 00:35:36,155
He was in control.

723
00:35:36,192 --> 00:35:38,494
And there was nothing
that I could do about it.

724
00:35:38,532 --> 00:35:40,162
The war isn't over yet

725
00:35:40,203 --> 00:35:43,041
but as far as Dukat is
concerned, he's already won.

726
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:45,678
I would love to show him
that he's wrong.

727
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:48,386
Well, for the moment, at least,
I'm afraid he has won.

728
00:35:48,427 --> 00:35:49,487
Look at me.

729
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:52,129
I don't know why I bother
to sit here every day.

730
00:35:52,171 --> 00:35:54,234
I don't even have
a security force

731
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,907
to patrol the Promenade.

732
00:35:55,948 --> 00:35:57,920
Then ask for one.

733
00:35:57,953 --> 00:36:02,523
Demand that they reinstate
your Bajoran deputies.

734
00:36:02,567 --> 00:36:04,401
Dukat will never agree to that.

735
00:36:04,438 --> 00:36:05,908
Forget about Dukat.

736
00:36:05,943 --> 00:36:07,573
Go to Weyoun.
He'll listen to you.

737
00:36:07,614 --> 00:36:09,586
As far as he's concerned

738
00:36:09,619 --> 00:36:11,818
you are a God,
and that gives you power.

739
00:36:13,698 --> 00:36:16,297
But what good is power
if you're not willing to use it?

740
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,380
We pledge our loyalty
to the Founders

741
00:36:22,422 --> 00:36:24,451
from now until death.

742
00:36:24,494 --> 00:36:26,762
Then receive this reward
from the Founders.

743
00:36:26,834 --> 00:36:28,464
May it keep you strong.

744
00:36:43,681 --> 00:36:45,812
You enjoy that, don't you?

745
00:36:45,921 --> 00:36:50,491
That constant reminder
that you're their master.

746
00:36:50,534 --> 00:36:52,733
The Founders are the masters.

747
00:36:52,774 --> 00:36:54,608
I am merely their servant

748
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:56,172
as are the Jem'Hadar...

749
00:36:56,216 --> 00:36:57,515
and you.

750
00:36:58,724 --> 00:37:00,558
That may be...

751
00:37:00,595 --> 00:37:02,897
but even amongst servants

752
00:37:02,935 --> 00:37:05,465
someone has to be
in charge, hmm?

753
00:37:07,114 --> 00:37:09,952
That is exactly
the kind of observation

754
00:37:09,988 --> 00:37:12,392
I've come to expect from you,
Dukat.

755
00:37:12,428 --> 00:37:15,995
Interesting, yet somewhat petty.

756
00:37:18,512 --> 00:37:21,077
Forgive the interruption,
but he insisted

757
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,318
on seeing you immediately.

758
00:37:25,899 --> 00:37:29,603
Founder, I'm honored
by your visit.

759
00:37:29,643 --> 00:37:31,477
Is there some way
I can be of service?

760
00:37:31,514 --> 00:37:34,580
I want my Bajoran security
officers reinstated.

761
00:37:34,624 --> 00:37:35,752
Consider it done.

762
00:37:35,793 --> 00:37:37,388
From now on,
they'll be responsible

763
00:37:37,431 --> 00:37:39,026
for security on the Promenade.

764
00:37:39,069 --> 00:37:40,231
I don't see
any problem with that.

765
00:37:41,209 --> 00:37:42,200
I do.

766
00:37:42,245 --> 00:37:44,308
This is between me and Odo.

767
00:37:45,755 --> 00:37:48,855
I'll thank you
to keep out of it.

768
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,371
I'll have
my officers report

769
00:37:54,413 --> 00:37:57,718
to the armory
within the hour.

770
00:37:57,755 --> 00:37:59,157
Now that I've done
something for you

771
00:37:59,192 --> 00:38:02,258
perhaps there's something
you'd consent to do for me.

772
00:38:11,728 --> 00:38:14,132
A member of the station's
Ruling Council.

773
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:15,397
You?

774
00:38:15,437 --> 00:38:17,932
Along with Weyoun and Dukat.

775
00:38:17,978 --> 00:38:20,543
Now, I'll have a voice
in station policy.

776
00:38:20,586 --> 00:38:22,181
You sure this is a good idea?

777
00:38:22,224 --> 00:38:24,696
Dukat thought it
was a terrible idea.

778
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:26,200
You should have seen his face

779
00:38:26,235 --> 00:38:28,264
when Weyoun offered
me the position.

780
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,243
But don't you see
that Weyoun is using you?

781
00:38:30,279 --> 00:38:32,216
Your presence on the Council

782
00:38:32,252 --> 00:38:34,588
validates the Dominion
control of the station.

783
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:37,155
I thought we were using him.

784
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:42,641
I know the danger, Major.

785
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,675
I've had to, to walk
this line before

786
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:46,656
during the Cardassian
occupation.

787
00:38:46,692 --> 00:38:47,683
I can do it again

788
00:38:47,727 --> 00:38:49,561
but this time,
I won't be alone.

789
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,765
I'll have you to help me.

790
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,985
That's right, you will.

791
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:00,325
Then this is
a victory after all.

792
00:39:00,363 --> 00:39:03,064
I suppose it is...

793
00:39:06,045 --> 00:39:09,042
but for some reason
it just doesn't feel like one.

794
00:39:19,977 --> 00:39:22,610
The ship ahead
just transmitted a message

795
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:24,782
to the asteroid
storage facility.

796
00:39:24,824 --> 00:39:29,132
They're requesting to be
resupplied with ketracel-white.

797
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:32,167
Looks like we've come
to the right place.

798
00:39:37,225 --> 00:39:41,191
The ship beamed down
110 empty canisters.

799
00:39:41,237 --> 00:39:45,146
Now the storage facility
is beaming up 110 full ones.

800
00:39:45,181 --> 00:39:46,981
Everything ready, Chief?

801
00:39:47,019 --> 00:39:48,887
I've got 83 empty canisters

802
00:39:48,924 --> 00:39:50,690
standing by,
and one not-so-empty.

803
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:53,235
90 isotons
of enriched ultritium.

804
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:55,401
It should take care
of the entire storage facility

805
00:39:55,443 --> 00:39:57,813
and everything else
within 800 kilometers.

806
00:39:57,849 --> 00:39:58,875
Which means we have to be

807
00:39:58,919 --> 00:40:01,825
900 kilometers away
before the bomb goes off.

808
00:40:01,861 --> 00:40:03,263
The other ship is leaving orbit.

809
00:40:03,298 --> 00:40:04,996
Dax.

810
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:07,167
The entire exchange
took 92.3 seconds.

811
00:40:07,209 --> 00:40:10,206
I've asked for 84 canisters
of ketracel-white.

812
00:40:13,627 --> 00:40:14,596
Excellent.

813
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:16,727
They're acknowledging
my request.

814
00:40:20,781 --> 00:40:23,117
Chief, set the detonator
for three minutes.

815
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:24,647
Detonator set.

816
00:40:26,363 --> 00:40:27,457
Three minutes?

817
00:40:27,499 --> 00:40:29,698
If it takes 92.3 seconds
to make the exchange

818
00:40:29,739 --> 00:40:31,106
that doesn't give us
much time, sir.

819
00:40:31,142 --> 00:40:33,079
That doesn't give the
Jem'Hadar much time

820
00:40:33,115 --> 00:40:34,813
to detect the explosive either.

821
00:40:34,886 --> 00:40:36,150
Commander, beam
down the canisters.

822
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,162
Canisters away.

823
00:40:38,196 --> 00:40:40,133
I hope whoever's
in charge down there

824
00:40:40,167 --> 00:40:41,933
hasn't taken a lunch break.

825
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:43,841
The Jem'Hadar don't eat, Nog.

826
00:40:43,878 --> 00:40:44,847
That's good.

827
00:40:44,881 --> 00:40:46,283
How do we know
they're Jem'Hadar?

828
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:48,290
Relax, Cadet.
Everything's on schedule.

829
00:40:48,324 --> 00:40:49,851
They've just beamed

830
00:40:49,928 --> 00:40:52,366
84 canisters of white
into our cargo bay.

831
00:40:52,402 --> 00:40:53,872
I've acknowledged
receipt

832
00:40:53,939 --> 00:40:56,138
and requested clearance
for departure.

833
00:40:56,179 --> 00:40:57,375
Good.
Prepare to go to warp.

834
00:40:57,416 --> 00:40:59,216
Standing by.

835
00:41:04,636 --> 00:41:07,201
Captain, I think
we have a problem.

836
00:41:07,243 --> 00:41:10,046
They've just raised
the security net.

837
00:41:10,085 --> 00:41:12,080
Repeat our request
for clearance.

838
00:41:13,094 --> 00:41:14,689
They're not responding.

839
00:41:16,503 --> 00:41:17,665
If they don't
shut down that net

840
00:41:17,706 --> 00:41:19,574
before the bomb goes off,
we don't have a chance.

841
00:41:19,611 --> 00:41:22,083
One minute, 30 seconds
to detonation.

842
00:41:29,539 --> 00:41:31,066
Do you think
they found the bomb?

843
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:32,774
I doubt it, not this fast.

844
00:41:32,815 --> 00:41:34,376
Then why aren't they
letting us go?

845
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,514
That's a good question.

846
00:41:35,556 --> 00:41:36,650
Captain, they're responding.

847
00:41:36,692 --> 00:41:38,424
They're ordering
us to stand by.

848
00:41:38,464 --> 00:41:39,295
For what?

849
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:40,563
They're not saying.

850
00:41:40,603 --> 00:41:42,039
One minute, 15 seconds.

851
00:41:42,074 --> 00:41:45,778
Chief, can we punch a hole
in the security net?

852
00:41:45,818 --> 00:41:47,652
Sure, but it'll take
a couple of minutes.

853
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:49,685
We don't have
a couple of minutes.

854
00:41:49,728 --> 00:41:52,293
What if we disable
the net's power generator?

855
00:41:52,336 --> 00:41:53,703
The explosion will do that.

856
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,540
Well, that won't do us
much good.

857
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:56,479
One minute.

858
00:41:56,515 --> 00:41:58,213
Maybe it will.

859
00:41:58,253 --> 00:42:01,319
When the generator's destroyed,
the net'll come down.

860
00:42:01,361 --> 00:42:02,854
All we have to do is to time it

861
00:42:02,899 --> 00:42:04,335
so that we're
moving fast enough

862
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:05,566
at the moment of detonation

863
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:08,045
to avoid being caught
in the explosion.

864
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,450
But not so fast
that we smash into the net

865
00:42:10,487 --> 00:42:11,957
before it's deactivated.

866
00:42:11,991 --> 00:42:13,085
It's tricky.

867
00:42:13,127 --> 00:42:14,859
Not if we time it right.

868
00:42:16,136 --> 00:42:20,273
Let's see... a radial geodesic
in a 39 Cochrane warp field

869
00:42:20,314 --> 00:42:22,752
contracts normal space
at a rate of...

870
00:42:22,788 --> 00:42:23,757
We have to go to full impulse

871
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:26,263
1.3 seconds
before the bomb detonates.

872
00:42:26,298 --> 00:42:27,460
Dax?

873
00:42:27,501 --> 00:42:29,199
The computer agrees with Julian.

874
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:30,333
Of course it does.

875
00:42:30,375 --> 00:42:31,401
They think alike.

876
00:42:31,445 --> 00:42:32,778
Turning over

877
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:35,483
piloting controls
to the main computer.

878
00:42:35,524 --> 00:42:36,618
Set.

879
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:37,423
Time?

880
00:42:37,462 --> 00:42:39,627
22 seconds until the explosion.

881
00:42:39,668 --> 00:42:40,830
22 seconds.

882
00:42:40,871 --> 00:42:42,273
That's plenty of time.

883
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:44,109
See, Cadet? There was
nothing to worry about.

884
00:42:55,278 --> 00:42:56,474
Must have gone off early.

885
00:42:56,515 --> 00:42:57,506
Dax, get us out of here!

886
00:43:17,942 --> 00:43:20,609
Well, not quite
according to plan

887
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:23,819
but I'm sure Starfleet
will be quite satisfied

888
00:43:23,859 --> 00:43:25,055
with the results.

889
00:43:25,096 --> 00:43:26,087
I agree, Mr. Garak.

890
00:43:26,165 --> 00:43:27,259
Well done, old man.

891
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:30,572
How bad is it, Chief?

892
00:43:30,611 --> 00:43:32,309
It doesn't look good.

893
00:43:32,349 --> 00:43:34,321
I'm going to have to switch
to auxiliary life support.

894
00:43:34,354 --> 00:43:38,890
Deflectors are down,
guidance system's shot, and...

895
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:41,339
And what?

896
00:43:42,511 --> 00:43:44,414
The core matrix is fried.

897
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:46,684
We don't have warp drive.

898
00:43:49,531 --> 00:43:53,338
Uh, forgive my ignorance,
but if we don't have warp drive

899
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:54,845
how long is it going
to take us

900
00:43:54,878 --> 00:43:56,850
to reach the closest
Federation starbase?

901
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:59,551
A long time, Mr. Garak.

902
00:43:59,592 --> 00:44:00,788
How long?

903
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:06,703
17 years, two months
and three days...

904
00:44:06,745 --> 00:44:09,948
give or take an hour.
