1
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:08,592
<i>Last time on</i>
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine...

2
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:10,051
O'BRIEN:
<i>More Jem'Hadar ships</i>

3
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:11,512
come through the
wormhole every week.

4
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:12,847
It must stop.

5
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:14,181
It's going to stop.

6
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,724
How do we keep them out?

7
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:17,601
We're going to mine
the entrance to the wormhole.

8
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:19,478
<i>Prevent the Dominion</i>
<i>from bringing</i>

9
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:21,730
<i>any more reinforcements</i>
<i>to Cardassia.</i>

10
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,231
Either you remove the mines,

11
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:25,400
or we will take
this station

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,944
from you...

13
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,821
and remove them ourselves.

14
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:35,202
Mr. Worf, all weapons
fire at will.

15
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,962
I've been waiting
for this moment
for five years.

16
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,471
We've lost main power
to the shields.

17
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,436
(<i> yells</i> )

18
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:04,439
What are your orders, Captain?

19
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,525
We've done
all we can here.

20
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:10,070
Notify all remaining
Starfleet personnel.

21
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,866
We're evacuating
the station.

22
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:15,450
I heard you're not
coming with us--

23
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,702
that you've been assigned
to Martok's ship.

24
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:17,745
It may be some time

25
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,246
before we see
each other again.

26
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,122
Worf, we may<i> never</i> 
see each other again.

27
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,713
Dukat wanted
the station back.

28
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:29,464
He can have it.

29
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,100
<i>And now, the continuation.</i>

30
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,543
Cadet?

31
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,212
Long-range scanners show
no sign of Jem'Hadar ships.

32
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,590
Looks like they've broken off
the pursuit.

33
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,885
O'BRIEN:
I guess they got tired
of looking at our backs.

34
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:16,219
Three months
of bloody slaughter,

35
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,262
and what have we got
to show for it?

36
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,346
Not a damned thing.

37
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:19,765
Engage, retreat,
engage, retreat.

38
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:21,308
Just once, I
would've liked

39
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:22,935
to have gotten
a look at<i> their</i> backs.

40
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:24,352
Chief, that's enough.

41
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,604
Sorry, sir.

42
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:27,856
Nothing a little sleep
won't cure.

43
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,317
We could all use some sleep.

44
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,611
What has it been-- 78 hours?

45
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,113
Shouldn't we
have heard something

46
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:35,322
from the Seventh Fleet
by now?

47
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,116
DAX:
I wouldn't worry
just yet.

48
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:38,784
The Tyra system
is far enough away

49
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:41,244
that it'll be a day or two
before we get any message.

50
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,831
You think they could
stop the Dominion?

51
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,457
Damn right they can.

52
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:46,667
Somebody has to.

53
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:55,216
Ah, there you are.

54
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:58,012
I was beginning
to give up hope, Doctor.

55
00:02:58,012 --> 00:03:00,388
I would think that all
those lunches we've shared

56
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,766
would have entitled me
to preferential treatment.

57
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:05,560
Look, I have 12
wounded officers and
crewman out there,

58
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,438
all of whom are in
a lot worse shape
than you, Garak.

59
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,273
Well, if you're trying
to cheer me up,

60
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,358
it's working.

61
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,567
I feel better already.

62
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,028
What happened?

63
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:16,697
I was studying some star charts
for Captain Sisko

64
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,448
during the last assault,
when I had a sudden

65
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:21,160
and rather violent encounter
with a bulkhead.

66
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,786
You'll live.

67
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,538
I wish I shared
your confidence.

68
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,999
I'm sure my
head will heal,

69
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:28,583
but the way this
war is going,

70
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,127
I wouldn't bet
on any of us

71
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,712
living to a ripe old age.

72
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,964
I admit the odds are not good,
but they could be worse.

73
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,340
Ah, let me guess.

74
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,885
You've used your
genetically enhanced brain

75
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:40,220
to<i> calculate</i> our
chances for survival.

76
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,638
It really wasn't
that difficult.

77
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,057
I simply started
with a binomial--

78
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:45,684
I'm<i> really</i> not
interested, Doctor.

79
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,310
Ever since it's become
public knowledge

80
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,896
that you're genetically
engineered,

81
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:51,606
you've used every
opportunity to show off.

82
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,067
I have nothing
to hide anymore.

83
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:55,110
I might as well use
what I have.

84
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,613
Well... what<i> are</i> 
our chances?

85
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,573
Over 50 percent?

86
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,700
32.7.

87
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,118
I'm sorry I asked.

88
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,286
You're certain
about that figure?

89
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,496
Do you want me to take you

90
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,956
through the entire set
of calculations?

91
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,000
Not really.

92
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,169
"Genetically engineered,"
indeed.

93
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,212
Excuse me?

94
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:14,588
Well, look at you.

95
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,424
You act as if you haven't
a care in the world.

96
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:20,343
It's exactly that kind
of smug, superior attitude

97
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,930
that makes people like
you so... unpopular.

98
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,223
Are you trying
to insult me?

99
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:26,808
"A 32.7 percent chance
of survival"--

100
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,393
I call<i> that</i> insulting.

101
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,478
Don't take it
so personally, Garak.

102
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,231
It's strictly a matter
of mathematics.

103
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:34,482
No. It's strictly
a matter of our lives.

104
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,318
You're not genetically
engineered.

105
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,362
You're a Vulcan.

106
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,115
If I'm a Vulcan

107
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:43,575
then how do you explain
my boyish smile?

108
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:47,037
Not so boyish
anymore, Doctor.

109
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,082
DAX:
So where do you think

110
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:51,792
Starfleet will be
sending us next?

111
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:52,876
I don't know,
but if I have anything

112
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,253
to say about the matter,

113
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:56,546
we'll be going right back
to the front lines.

114
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,215
MARTOK:
Well said, Captain,

115
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,842
and my ship
will be at your side.

116
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,221
Worf!

117
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,308
Tell her.

118
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,018
Tell me what?

119
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,437
It can wait.

120
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,690
No! It cannot.

121
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,109
<i>Raktajino.</i>

122
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:20,862
It's been weighing heavily
on his mind.

123
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,447
What is it, Worf?
What's wrong?

124
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:28,453
It is about our wedding.

125
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,039
You're getting cold feet?

126
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,207
You have scheduled

127
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:33,834
the ritual sacrifice
of the<i> targ</i>

128
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,253
to occur<i> after</i> the wedding feast
has been served.

129
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,172
DAX:
We haven't
seen each other

130
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:40,924
for five weeks and that's
the first thing you say to me?

131
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:44,803
(<i> quietly</i> ):
We agreed it would be
a traditional ceremony.

132
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:47,264
(<i> sighing</i> )

133
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:50,267
Okay. Have it your way.

134
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,602
First, we'll shed blood,
and then we'll feast.

135
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:53,854
As it should be.

136
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,563
He has been unable

137
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:58,859
to talk of anything
else for days.

138
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,236
He's such a worrier.

139
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:02,612
SISKO:
Take it from me,
old man--

140
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,032
a small wedding
is the way to go.

141
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:06,950
Well, you get married
the way you want,

142
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,536
and I'll get married
the way I want.

143
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:10,996
I'll see you later,
Captain.

144
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,039
SISKO:
Try not to break

145
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,123
any bones.

146
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,419
Now that that's settled,

147
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,755
I'm going to take
care of this.

148
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,758
Klingons make great
warriors, but...

149
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,302
terrible doctors.

150
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:26,720
Captain...

151
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,263
Just the man
I wanted to see.

152
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:31,474
We've been ordered
to report to Starbase 375

153
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,726
for reassignment.

154
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,273
Something else, Doctor?

155
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:41,818
I have news of
the Seventh Fleet.

156
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,281
Go on.

157
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,325
Only 14 ships made it back
to our lines.

158
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,827
MARTOK:
Fourteen...

159
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:51,828
out of 112.

160
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:52,913
We can't keep taking

161
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,081
these kinds of
losses, sir,

162
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,332
not if we expect
to win this.

163
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,042
Thank you, Doctor.

164
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,168
That will be all.

165
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,468
I'll take a look
at that arm now.

166
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:23,938
DUKAT:
<i>Permanent Documentation File,</i>
<i>Dukat, S.G.</i>

167

<i>Each day brings reports</i>

00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,028

175
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:53,385
My dear Major Kira,
you have no idea

176
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:55,345
how it pleases me
to hear you say that.

177
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:56,388
Dukat,

178
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:57,638
the Major has
just given me

179
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:58,973
the most
wonderful news.

180
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:02,060
Bajorans are returning
to the station.

181
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,313
I'm well aware of it.

182
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,274
Then I'm sure you share
my delight

183
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:10,068
in knowing that life here
is returning to normal.

184
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,570
The shops are reopening.

185
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:14,573
The Promenade is abuzz
with activity once again.

186
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:16,032
The Habitat Ring echoes

187
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,700
with the laughter
of happy children.

188
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,077
I've doubled
security patrols

189
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,078
throughout the station.

190
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:27,294
Are such precautions
really necessary?

191
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:30,838
I've found that one
can't be too careful

192
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,882
when dealing
with the Bajorans.

193
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,426
What's the matter, Dukat?

194
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:36,303
Afraid we'll take the station
away from you again?

195
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,513
You're welcome
to try.

196
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:39,931
Come now, come now.

197
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,849
There's no need
for this petty bickering.

198
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,101
We're all
friends here.

199
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,102
Are we?

200
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:46,396
Of course we are,

201
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,398
and if you have
any suggestions, Major,

202
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,733
feel free to bring them
to me at any time.

203
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,527
Fine.

204
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:56,030
We'd like the station's Bajoran
security force reinstated.

205
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,407
I suppose you want us

206
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,700
to give them back
their weapons as well.

207
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,953
That's right.

208
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:04,205
The station
no longer requires

209
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,541
a Bajoran security force.

210
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,877
Our troops can handle
any problems that might arise.

211
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,297
The Federation and Bajor
always shared

212
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:15,049
equal responsibility
for station security.

213
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,218
I thought you said
that we would have

214
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,761
the same arrangement
with the Dominion.

215
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,763
After all,

216
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,141
we<i> are</i> all friends here...

217
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,643
aren't we?

218
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:28,396
Perhaps you should
reconsider your decision.

219
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,898
The order stands.

220
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,278
You may trust the Bajorans,
but I don't...

221
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,406
and until they earn my trust,

222
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,992
I prefer to keep
them unarmed.

223
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,536
And if you were in
my position, Major,

224
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:45,830
you would do
exactly the same thing.

225
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,834
Perhaps it would be best

226
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,336
to let the matter rest
for a while.

227
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:54,047
I'm sure in time we'll
be able to resolve

228
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,508
all these minor problems
to our mutual satisfaction.

229
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:57,716
I'll remember
you said that.

230
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:59,344
I'm sure you will.

231
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:00,470
One last thing...

232
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,515
Odo.

233
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:04,932
What about him?

234
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:08,520
(<i> quietly</i> ):
Is he aware

235
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,980
that I'm doing
everything I can

236
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,399
to strengthen the bond

237
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,318
between the Dominion
and the Bajoran people?

238
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,321
Why don't you ask him
yourself?

239
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:22,617
No, no. I wouldn't
want to bother him.

240
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,371
Good day, Major.

241
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,256
She's a fascinating
woman, isn't she?

242
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,091
I wouldn't know...

243
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:41,094
but I<i> do</i> know we
need her as an ally.

244
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,096
The Bajorans will never
be our allies.

245
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,097
Out.

246
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,599
Don't look
at him.

247
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,350
I'm telling you to leave.

248
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,727
Now!

249
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,530
I find him useful.

250
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,948
In the future...

251
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:07,120
it might be prudent
for you to include me

252
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,707
in all decisions
regarding station policy.

253
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,293
Now...

254
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,629
what about
the wormhole?

255
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,756
You assured me that
you would be able

256
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:19,758
to dismantle the minefield
within a month.

257
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,175
That was<i> two</i> months ago.

258
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,677
Well, I admit

259
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:26,765
the work is proceeding
more slowly than expected,

260
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:30,351
but as you know,
these are not ordinary mines.

261
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:34,105
Every time we deactivate
or destroy one of them,

262
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:37,317
its neighbor replicates
a new one.

263
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,529
We have to take down
that minefield

264
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,364
and reopen the wormhole.

265
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,824
And we will.

266
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:48,536
But there's no need for panic.

267
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,164
We are winning the war.

268
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:54,584
For the moment, yes,
but to defeat the Federation,

269
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,085
we're going to need
reinforcements

270
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,963
and new supplies
of ketracel-white...

271
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,381
soon.

272
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,966
Weyoun...

273
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:07,846
I said I will deal
with the minefield,

274
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:10,391
and I will.

275
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,976
Hmm.

276
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,700
Good evening, gentlemen.

277
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,328
Once again, I see
you're at your usual table.

278
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:33,039
It's amazing
how many of my customers

279
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,583
think of Quark's
as their second home.

280
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,960
I only wish I had
a holo-imager

281
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,420
so I could preserve

282
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:44,175
this warm and wonderful
moment of camaraderie.

283
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,177
Something
you could hang

284
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,429
on the wall
of your barracks.

285
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:53,893
Have you tried
the dabo tables?

286
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,437
I'm sure one
of my lovely hostesses

287
00:14:56,437 --> 00:15:00,274
would be happy
to teach you the game.

288
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,235
I know...

289
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,320
a complimentary hour

290
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,990
in one of our
state-of-the-art holosuites.

291
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,410
Whatever
your desires,

292
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,830
I'm sure we can satisfy them.

293
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,583
Perhaps another time.

294
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,958
Enjoy the evening.

295
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,672
Tough crowd.

296
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,006
I'm telling you, Odo,

297
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,509
Dukat has only one thing
on his mind,

298
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:27,719
and that's revenge.

299
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:29,303
He can't stand
the thought

300
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,971
that Bajor
defeated Cardassia.

301
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:33,850
You think he wants to
reopen the labor camps?

302
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,351
Oh, eventually.

303
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,312
Well, then, I suppose
we should be grateful

304
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,566
that he has Weyoun
looking over his shoulder.

305
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:42,776
Maybe.

306
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,819
Weyoun's a hard one
to figure out.

307
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:47,321
I don't really
trust him, but...

308
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,324
I trust him
more than Dukat.

309
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,992
Weyoun knows
that it's

310
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:54,454
in the Dominion's
best interest

311
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,748
to honor its treaty
with Bajor.

312
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:58,082
They want to prove

313
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,084
to the rest of
the Alpha Quadrant

314
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,211
that they're true
to their word.

315
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,255
Weyoun asked me
about you.

316
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:05,632
He seemed very concerned

317
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,007
about what you
thought of him.

318
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,301
(<i> scoffs</i> )

319
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:11,137
I try<i> not</i> 
to think of him.

320
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,556
He'd be hurt to hear
you say that.

321
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:16,100
I'll have to mention it
to him.

322
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:19,437
(<i> chuckles</i> )

323
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:21,898
I'm glad you
can still smile.

324
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:24,400
Ah, only
when I'm with you.

325
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,902
That's kind of
you to say.

326
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,612
No, it's true.

327
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:31,532
When I talk to you,
things don't seem<i> as</i> bad.

328
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:35,119
When I think of Dukat
in the Captain's office

329
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,623
or the fact that the Federation
seems to be losing this war,

330
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:41,000
and we're sitting here
doing<i> nothing...</i>

331
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,336
I share your frustration, Major,
but right now,

332
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,922
there's really nothing we can do
but bide our time.

333
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:49,676
It's like Captain Sisko said--
Bajor must be kept

334
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,970
out of the fighting.

335
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,430
And who am I to argue
with the Emissary?

336
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,890
QUARK:
Thanks for waiting.

337
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,726
Things have been
a little busier than expected.

338
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,646
This one's
on the house.

339
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,398
What do you want, Quark?

340
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:07,986
The usual--
peace, love, and understanding.

341
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:09,821
Not to mention

342
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,656
a generous profit margin,

343
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:14,450
which, I'm happy to say,
is looking more and more likely.

344
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:18,329
You know, I never
expected to say this,

345
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:22,667
but as occupations go,
this one's not so bad.

346
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,335
No, I suppose
that's true

347
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,880
if all you're worried about
is a monthly balance sheet.

348
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,216
I'm not just concerned
with profit, Major.

349
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,344
Look around.

350
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:36,263
Do you see any ghetto fences
dividing the Promenade?

351
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:39,099
Or exhausted
Bajoran slave laborers

352
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,101
sprawled on the ground
after a grueling day

353
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,478
in the ore-processing
center?

354
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,939
Do you hear
the cries of starving children?

355
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:45,982
I don't.

356
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,942
Now, don't
get me wrong.

357
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,778
I miss the Federation, too.

358
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,948
All I'm saying is

359
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:56,617
things could be a lot worse.

360
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,747
(<i> sighs</i> )

361
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:04,042
I hate to say this,
but he's right.

362
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:06,419
The Dominion seems
determined to prove

363
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,922
that it can be
a friend to Bajor.

364
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,632
If it's such
a good friend,

365
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:15,678
why are there
no Bajoran security officers

366
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,179
on the station?

367
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:34,196
I'm glad you made it back
in one piece, Ben.

368
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,322
I was lucky.

369
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,241
We lost a lot
of good people.

370
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,451
Yes, we did,

371
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,787
and we're going
to lose a lot more

372
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,371
before this is over.

373
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,417
I hope you'll find
this office satisfactory.

374
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:47,877
Office?

375
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,545
I wasn't aware
I'd be needing an office.

376
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,380
I thought I was here
for an assignment briefing.

377
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,007
I'm afraid
you're going to be here

378
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:54,842
for a lot longer
than you think, Captain.

379
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,636
As of right now,
you're no longer

380
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,096
in command of the<i> Defiant.</i>

381
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:11,692
Relieved of command?

382
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,693
Why?

383
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,904
Admiral Ross
didn't say.

384
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,032
He<i> did</i> say
we'll be getting

385
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:20,576
our new assignment
at 1600 hours.

386
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:24,038
Well, at least the crew
is staying together.

387
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,959
We<i> are</i> staying together,
aren't we?

388
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:29,209
You can count on it.

389
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:34,548
So what do you plan on doing
the next couple of hours?

390
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,176
I haven't given
it much thought.

391
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,053
Maybe now would be
a good time

392
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:40,805
to contact your father.

393
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:46,102
Maybe.

394
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:50,272
Benjamin, you haven't
spoken to him for months,

395
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,358
and Jake<i> is</i> 
his grandson.

396
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,401
How do I explain

397
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,988
that I evacuated
every Federation citizen

398
00:19:56,988 --> 00:20:00,491
off Deep Space 9
<i>except</i> his grandson?

399
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:02,326
You'll think of something.

400
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:05,245
You always do.

401
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,706
You did what?

402
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:09,208
Dad, it's not quite
as bad as it sounds.

403
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,711
You mean, you didn't leave
my grandson

404
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:14,547
at the mercy of a vicious,
bloodthirsty enemy?

405
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,758
Well... no.

406
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,593
I did.

407
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,847
Then it's certainly
just as bad as it sounds.

408
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,640
Dad, it was not my decision.

409
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,767
It was Jake's choice
to stay behind.

410
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,645
Oh, so now you're going
to blame this on Jake.

411
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,313
I'm not blaming Jake.

412
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,024
He's not a child anymore.

413
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:35,359
He's responsible
for his own actions.

414
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,195
I don't care who's responsible.

415
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:39,113
It's wrong, and I want him back.

416
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:40,865
And so do I.

417
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,454
Do you think he's all right?

418
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,415
I hope so.

419
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,252
I'll bring him back, Dad.

420
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,754
I promise.

421
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:55,796
When?

422
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:56,881
That I don't know.

423
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:58,091
It might be a while.

424
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:59,717
I'm about to be given
new orders,

425
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,385
and I don't know
where they're going to send me.

426
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,721
Tell them
you want to go get your son.

427
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:05,223
It's wartime.

428
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:06,807
It's not up to me.
I go where I'm sent.

429
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:11,854
(<i> sighing</i> )

430
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:14,481
How's the restaurant doing?

431
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,025
All right.

432
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:19,445
It's been three weeks
since I poisoned anyone.

433
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:24,283
Are things really as bad
as the news service claims?

434
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,202
Maybe worse.

435
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:29,830
Well, you certainly know how
to comfort a frightened old man.

436
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,166
You didn't raise me
to be a liar.

437
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,294
I raised you to be a chef,
for all the good it did me.

438
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,338
You know, there's something
I just don't understand.

439
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:42,468
You're always telling me
that space is big,

440
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:46,764
that it's an endless frontier
filled with infinite wonders.

441
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:47,807
It's true.

442
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:48,891
Well, if that's the case,

443
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:50,559
you would think it would be...

444
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,936
<i>more</i> than enough room

445
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:54,730
to allow people
to leave each other alone.

446
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,152
It just doesn't work that way.

447
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:02,113
It should, but it doesn't.

448
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:05,658
I better be going.

449
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07,367
The lunch crowd's coming in.

450
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:12,790
You watch yourself, Ben...

451
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:16,002
and bring me back my grandson.

452
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:17,670
I will.

453
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,547
I love you.

454
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,300
I love you, too.

455
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,302
(<i> breaks connection</i> )

456
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,512
Hello.

457
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,348
Excuse me,
Mr. Weyoun.

458
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:32,476
Oh... please.

459
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,478
Uh, I prefer
just, uh... Weyoun.

460
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:38,107
That's the kind
of detail people
like to know.

461
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,317
Uh, would this
be a good time?

462
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:40,567
For what?

463
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:41,986
For the interview
we talked about--

464
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,737
you know, for the
Federation News Service.

465
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:46,115
Oh, ho, I'm afraid that
will be quite impossible.

466
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:47,449
Why?

467
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,409
Because I've read
your previous articles,

468
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,829
and they left me with
one inescapable conclusion--

469
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:54,456
you are biased
against the Dominion.

470
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,374
What-what gave
you that idea?

471
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:57,584
You keep referring to us

472
00:22:57,584 --> 00:23:01,088
as the station's
"occupying force."

473
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,380
What's wrong
with that?

474
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,051
It has a negative
connotation.

475
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:09,096
All your articles are filled
with pejorative terminology,

476
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,597
which is why
I've been forced

477
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,474
to withhold
their transmission.

478
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,934
Are you telling me
that no one

479
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,602
from the Federation
read my reports?

480
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,188
If I don't send them,
they don't read them.

481
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:18,605
What about freedom
of the press?

482
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:22,109
Please tell me
you're not that naive.

483
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,986
The only reason
I stayed here

484
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:26,113
was to report on
the occupation.

485
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,656
You see,
there you go again.

486
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:30,201
This is<i> not</i> an occupation.

487
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:32,661
This is a Cardassian
station, Jake,

488
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,288
and I'm sure you're aware

489
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:36,249
there are no Dominion troops
on Bajor.

490
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:37,250
Why should there be?

491
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,292
We have a treaty with them.

492
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:39,377
They're our friends.

493
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,129
All right.
I'm sorry.

494
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,881
I didn't mean
anything by it.

495
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:45,132
If you want me

496
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,134
to send your articles
to the Federation,

497
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:50,971
you're going to have to provide
a more balanced perspective.

498
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,557
I won't write
Dominion propaganda.

499
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,809
I would never dream
of asking you to.

500
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:59,813
All I want is for you
to keep an open mind.

501
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,274
All right. My
mind is open.

502
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:03,109
Now can we do
the interview?

503
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:05,443
(<i> chuckling</i> )

504
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:07,029
All in good time.

505
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:09,031
You keep writing.
I'll keep reading.

506
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:10,324
Let's leave it
at that for now.

507
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:12,952
(<i> chuckling</i> ):
Good day, Jake.

508
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,670
Starfleet Intelligence
has discovered

509
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,965
what we believe to be
their main storage facility

510
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,342
for ketracel-white
in the Alpha Quadrant--

511
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:30,510
right here,
deep in Cardassian space.

512
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,305
We need to
destroy it.

513
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:34,098
Without the white
to sustain them,

514
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:36,434
the Jem'Hadar
won't be able to function.

515
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:38,769
Without the white,
the Jem'Hadar will die.

516
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:40,354
I won't shed any tears,

517
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:42,231
not if it
helps end this war.

518
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:46,444
It may be our only way to end
this war, short of surrendering.

519
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:49,196
How do you expect us to
infiltrate Cardassian territory

520
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,573
without the<i> Defiant</i> 
and its cloaking abilities?

521
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,659
I was wondering
the same thing.

522
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,661
You won't need
a cloaking device.

523
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:57,537
We have something even better.

524
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,170
DAX:
A Jem'Hadar attack ship.

525
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,922
It's the one you captured
last year, Captain.

526
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,675
Now you get a chance
to see what it can do.

527
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:12,094
Do you even know
how to fly that thing?

528
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:16,307
Not yet, but I
intend to learn.

529
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:30,112
Guidance matrix, check.

530
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:34,450
Aft parabolic thrusters, check.

531
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,493
Sensor feed, check.

532
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:36,910
Chief.

533
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,288
Reactor core, check.

534
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:41,957
Induction stabilizers, check.

535
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,583
Phaser coils, check.

536
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:44,751
Nog.

537
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:46,544
Resonance emitters, check.

538
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:48,255
Subspace field grid, check.

539
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:51,175
Signal subprocessors, check.

540
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:52,468
I think.

541
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:53,677
You think?

542
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:54,761
We've been training
on this ship

543
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,430
for two weeks now.

544
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,598
I would like to put a Jem'Hadar
soldier on the<i> Defiant</i>

545
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:00,726
and see how well<i> he</i> does
after two weeks.

546
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:03,229
These controls
are very... different.

547
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:04,897
They take time
to get used to.

548
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,773
We don't have
any more time.

549
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,901
We're about
to take this ship
into enemy territory.

550
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,361
We don't want
any slip-ups.

551
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:12,612
I don't intend
to make any, Chief.

552
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:14,240
Good.

553
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,449
I still don't see
why we couldn't install

554
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:16,950
a few chairs on the Bridge.

555
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,245
Because this ship
wasn't designed for chairs.

556
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:20,746
Well, my feet
aren't designed

557
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,789
to stand
for long periods of time.

558
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,124
They get tired.

559
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,583
Maybe we should
leave you behind.

560
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:28,295
My feet might like that,
but I wouldn't.

561
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,881
It's not your feet
you need to worry about.

562
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:31,924
It's your stomach.

563
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,217
Have you noticed?

564
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:34,968
There isn't
a single food replicator

565
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,594
anywhere on this ship.

566
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:38,805
That shouldn't
be a problem.

567
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,057
Captain Sisko says
there'll be

568
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:41,392
plenty of field rations.

569
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:43,769
Trying eating field rations
for three weeks

570
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,145
and then tell me
it isn't a problem.

571
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,522
DAX:
You know what
is a problem?

572
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:47,856
No viewscreen.

573
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,816
Who builds a Bridge
without a window?

574
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:52,486
The same people who build a ship
without an Infirmary.

575
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:54,863
Here's a list of all the medical
supplies I brought on board.

576
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,283
They're in my quarters,
for want of a better space.

577
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:58,700
Well, don't worry.

578
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,120
We'll try not to have
any medical emergencies

579
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,288
while you're sleeping.

580
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:03,914
I'm so glad that you find

581
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:06,959
the lack of proper
medical facilities amusing,

582
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,752
but if trouble breaks out,

583
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:12,590
it's not a viewscreen
or a chair or even a sandwich

584
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,799
you'll be wanting.

585
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,092
It's a bio-bed

586
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:17,136
with a surgical
tissue regenerator.

587
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:18,304
Maybe, but right now,

588
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:20,598
I would settle
for a viewscreen.

589
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:21,599
Or a chair.

590
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:22,891
Or a sandwich.

591
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:28,439
All right, people,
prepare for departure.

592
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:30,023
All systems ready, sir.

593
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,442
Garak, come to see us off?

594
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:32,610
Uh, not quite.

595
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,320
I invited Mr. Garak
to join us.

596
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,572
Considering we're heading
into Cardassian territory,

597
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:38,282
I thought
he might prove useful.

598
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:39,699
Well, it's been
known to happen.

599
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,496
Pull up a chair.

600
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:44,830
We're cleared for departure,
sir.

601
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:51,504
Take us out, old man.

602
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:52,838
Aye, Captain.

603
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,465
Aft thrusters at one-half.

604
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,761
SISKO:
Bring us about.

605
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,186
DAX:
Just wanted
to make sure

606
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,895
everyone was awake.

607
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:11,649
We are now.

608
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:15,027
Just take it nice and easy,
all right?

609
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,403
I can try.

610
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,113
Set a course

611
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:21,992
for the Cardassian border,
heading 054 mark 093.

612
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:23,369
Warp six.

613
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:24,495
Yes, sir.

614
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,425
(<i> door chimes</i> )

615
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,885
Come in.

616
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:43,138
You wanted to see me?

617
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:46,892
I<i> always</i> want to see you, Major,

618
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:49,478
and therein lies
the problem.

619
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:53,023
It's been three months
since my return to this station,

620
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:56,818
and you and I have barely spent
any time with one another.

621
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,737
Oh, I know you could point out

622
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,240
the various meetings
we've attended together,

623
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,950
but... they never seem
to offer us

624
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:08,080
the opportunity to venture
beyond station business.

625
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,956
I don't have time for this.

626
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:10,999
Major!

627
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:18,215
I haven't dismissed you yet.

628
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:22,261
What do you want
from me, Dukat?

629
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,347
Come now, Major.

630
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:29,268
Have the last three months
been that bad?

631
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:31,228
Is that what you want?

632
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:33,063
Is that why I'm here?

633
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:34,607
To flatter you?

634
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:37,401
To tell you what
a good job you've done

635
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:39,986
and how happy we all
are to have you back?

636
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:43,031
Sarcasm doesn't
become you, Major.

637
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,409
It's your directness

638
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:48,287
that I've always found
most appealing.

639
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,289
Dukat, I got better things
to do

640
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,708
than to stand around
and help you play out

641
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:54,418
one of your little fantasies.

642
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:59,965
You feel I've betrayed you.

643
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,383
Not just me.

644
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:03,427
Everyone.

645
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:05,053
Even your own people.

646
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:15,105
Cardassia was on the edge
of an abyss, Major.

647
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:22,321
The war with the Klingons
left us a third-rate power.

648
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:24,406
My people had
lost their way.

649
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:26,784
I've made them strong again.

650
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:27,951
At what price?

651
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:30,329
You sold Cardassia
to the Dominion.

652
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:31,747
Yes--

653
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:34,500
a high price, to be sure,

654
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,671
but look what we're getting
in return.

655
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:41,632
The Alpha Quadrant itself.

656
00:30:41,632 --> 00:30:43,883
We'll see about that.

657
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:47,346
Yes, we will.

658
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:54,019
Oh... I could make things very
pleasant for you here, Kira.

659
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:58,064
You could start by doing
something about your breath.

660
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:02,110
I'm a patient man.

661
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,070
I can wait.

662
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,156
Wait for what?

663
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:08,950
What do you think
is going to happen here, Dukat?

664
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,411
That you're going
to wear me down

665
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,038
with your charming personality?

666
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:15,081
That I'm going
to be swept off my feet

667
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,542
by that insincere smile?

668
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:17,917
Are you really so deluded

669
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,878
that you
actually believe

670
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,129
that we're going to have

671
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,255
some kind
of intimate relationship?

672
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:26,051
Oh, we already do.

673
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:36,770
(<i> chuckling</i> )

674
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,146
Good day, Major.

675
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,609
I have work to do.

676
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:08,093
BASHIR:
There.

677
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:09,595
I wish I had more time

678
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:11,680
to study the side effects
of wearing that headset.

679
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,223
At least we know one
side effect-- headaches.

680
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:14,974
Well, the headsets
were designed

681
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:17,143
to be worn by the Vorta and
the Jem'Hadar, not humans.

682
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,978
Captain, may I make
a suggestion?

683
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,480
Only if you talk softly.

684
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,065
We saw Dukat...
Shh.

685
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,525
(<i> softly</i> ):
wearing one of these headsets

686
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:25,485
during the attack
on Deep Space 9.

687
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:29,656
Perhaps Cardassian physiology
is more compatible.

688
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:30,741
Are you volunteering?

689
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:32,033
I suppose I am.

690
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,035
This ship is equipped
with two of them.

691
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,830
If I wore one,
then you wouldn't have to.

692
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,749
At least, not all the time.

693
00:32:38,749 --> 00:32:40,333
I agree with
Garak, Captain.

694
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,960
The less you wear
it, the better.

695
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:46,172
Garak.

696
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:51,052
Ah, it's like having
a viewscreen

697
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,053
inside your brain.

698
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,054
(<i> console beeping</i> )

699
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,598
NOG:
Sir...

700
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:57,935
there's a Federation ship
off our starboard bow

701
00:32:57,935 --> 00:33:01,271
bearing 157 mark 095.

702
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:03,106
It's the USS<i> Centaur.</i>

703
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,650
That's Charlie
Reynolds' ship.

704
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:05,984
I see it.

705
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,070
Ah.

706
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:15,869
Cadet, open a channel

707
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:17,036
to the<i> Centaur.</i>

708
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,956
I can't.
Our com system's down.

709
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:20,874
Perhaps we should consider
returning fire.

710
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:22,709
We can't do that.
They're Starfleet.

711
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:27,297
Well, you tell
them, not us.

712
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:29,967
We better do something.

713
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:32,761
Dax, get us
across the border, maximum warp.

714
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:35,305
I hope Charlie Reynolds
knows better

715
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:37,056
than to follow us
into Dominion territory.

716
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,064
How long before we
cross the border?

717
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:46,817
We just did.

718
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,111
The<i> Centaur's</i> still with us.

719
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,905
Charlie never did know
when to quit.

720
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:53,406
I hope he knows
what he's doing.

721
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,659
The question is:
Do we know what we're doing?

722
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,328
Captain, that last hit

723
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:00,288
damaged one of our
guidance thrusters.

724
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,832
Drop us out of warp.

725
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:04,167
Come about.
Prepare to return fire.

726
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:08,672
Yes, sir.

727
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:11,424
The<i> Centaur</i> has dropped
out of warp.

728
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,804
Target their weapons array.

729
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:17,222
Avoid their engines.

730
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:19,182
I don't want to leave
Charlie out here stranded

731
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,934
on the wrong side
of the border.

732
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:28,483
We're coming about
for another pass.

733
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:31,611
Charlie likes to swing
for the fences so stay in tight.

734
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,112
Attack pattern omega.

735
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:43,916
DAX:
The<i> Centaur</i>

736
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:45,333
is going into warp.

737
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,793
They're heading back

738
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,003
to Federation space.

739
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:49,421
Yes.

740
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:51,006
Nice work, Chief.

741
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:54,175
I didn't know
I'd scored a direct hit.

742
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,928
Maybe you didn't.

743
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:57,971
I'm picking up three Jem'Hadar
ships headed this way.

744
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:59,973
He must have seen them.

745
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:05,311
They went right by us.

746
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:07,981
Without even bothering
to say hello.

747
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:10,025
They're too busy
chasing the<i> Centaur.</i>

748
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:12,151
Do you think Reynolds
will outrun them?

749
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:14,529
Charlie's been
in tight spots before.

750
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,739
He'll make it.

751
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:17,156
I wish we could help.

752
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:18,784
We can't.

753
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:21,954
Chief, get our com system
back on line.

754
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:24,163
Return to course.

755
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:27,000
Warp seven.

756
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,167
Yes, sir.

757
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,635
You should have seen the
arrogant, smug look on his face.

758
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,386
He was in control.

759
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,764
And there was<i> nothing</i> 
that I could do about it.

760
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:42,348
The war isn't over yet,

761
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:45,310
but as far as Dukat is
concerned, he's already won.

762
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,896
I would love to show him
that he's wrong.

763
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:50,107
Well, for the moment, at least,
I'm afraid he<i> has</i> won.

764
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:51,650
Look at me.

765
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,360
I don't know why I bother
to sit here every day.

766
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,571
I don't even have
a security force

767
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,197
to patrol the Promenade.

768
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:00,117
Then ask for one.

769
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:04,830
Demand that they reinstate
your Bajoran deputies.

770
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,665
Dukat will never agree to that.

771
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:08,041
Forget about Dukat.

772
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,709
Go to Weyoun.
He'll listen to you.

773
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,753
As far as
he's concerned,

774
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:14,047
you are a God,
and that gives you power.

775
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:18,593
But what good is power
if you're not willing to use it?

776
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:24,683
JEM'HADAR SOLDIERS:
We pledge our loyalty
to the Founders

777
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,643
from now until death.

778
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:29,062
Then receive this reward
from the Founders.

779
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:30,689
May it keep you strong.

780
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:48,040
You enjoy that, don't you?

781
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:52,669
That constant reminder
that you're their master.

782
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:54,838
The Founders
are the masters.

783
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:56,756
I am merely
their servant,

784
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,383
as are the Jem'Hadar...

785
00:36:58,383 --> 00:36:59,676
and you.

786
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:02,679
That may be...

787
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:05,057
but even amongst servants,

788
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:07,600
someone has to be
in charge, hmm?

789
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:12,022
That is exactly the
kind of observation

790
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:14,524
I've come to expect
from you, Dukat.

791
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:18,111
Interesting, yet
somewhat petty.

792
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:23,200
Forgive the interruption,
but he insisted

793
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,451
on seeing you
immediately.

794
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:31,666
Founder, I'm honored
by your visit.

795
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,585
Is there some way
I can be of service?

796
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:36,713
I want my Bajoran security
officers reinstated.

797
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:37,923
Consider it done.

798
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:39,507
From now on,
they'll be responsible

799
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,009
for security
on the Promenade.

800
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:42,301
I don't see any
problem with that.

801
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,345
I do.

802
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,389
This is between
me and Odo.

803
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:50,977
I'll thank you
to keep out of it.

804
00:37:54,231 --> 00:37:56,482
I'll have
my officers report

805
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:59,652
to the armory
within the hour.

806
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:00,946
Now that I've done
something for you,

807
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:02,155
perhaps there's
something

808
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:04,323
you'd consent
to do for me.

809
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:16,169
A member of the station's
Ruling Council.

810
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:17,336
You?

811
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,839
Along with Weyoun
and Dukat.

812
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,592
Now,<i> I'll</i> have a voice
in station policy.

813
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:24,219
You sure this
is a good idea?

814
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:26,638
Dukat thought it
was a terrible idea.

815
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,181
You should have
seen his face

816
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:30,225
when Weyoun offered
me the position.

817
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:32,269
But don't you see
that Weyoun is using you?

818
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:34,229
Your presence
on the Council

819
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:36,564
validates the Dominion
control of the station.

820
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,151
I thought<i> we</i> 
were using<i> him.</i>

821
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,572
I know the danger, Major.

822
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,658
I've had to, to walk
this line before

823
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,534
during the Cardassian
occupation.

824
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:49,619
I can do it again,

825
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,537
but this time,
I won't be alone.

826
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:53,706
I'll have you to help me.

827
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,962
That's right, you will.

828
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:02,215
Then this is
a victory after all.

829
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:05,010
I suppose it is...

830
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,014
but for some reason,

831
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:10,974
it just doesn't
feel like one.

832
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:24,946
GARAK:
The ship ahead
just transmitted a message

833
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:27,115
to the asteroid
storage facility.

834
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:31,452
They're requesting to be
resupplied with ketracel-white.

835
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:34,497
Looks like we've come
to the right place.

836
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:43,464
The ship beamed down
110 empty canisters.

837
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:47,510
Now the storage facility
is beaming up 110 full ones.

838
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,179
Everything ready, Chief?

839
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:51,097
O'BRIEN:
I've got 83 empty canisters

840
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,932
standing by,
and one not-so-empty.

841
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:55,434
90 isotons
of enriched ultritium.

842
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,603
It should take care
of the entire storage facility

843
00:39:57,603 --> 00:40:00,106
and everything else
within 800 kilometers.

844
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,607
Which means we have to be

845
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:04,152
900 kilometers away
before the bomb goes off.

846
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:05,528
The other ship is leaving orbit.

847
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,280
Dax.

848
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,366
The entire exchange
took 92.3 seconds.

849
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:10,909
I've asked for
84 canisters

850
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,451
of ketracel-white.

851
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:15,872
(<i> communications beep</i> )

852
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,123
Excellent.

853
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,958
They're acknowledging
my request.

854
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:25,298
Chief, set the detonator
for three minutes.

855
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:26,883
O'BRIEN:
Detonator set.

856
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:29,928
Three minutes?

857
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,679
If it takes 92.3 seconds
to make the exchange,

858
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,181
that doesn't give us
much time, sir.

859
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:35,225
That doesn't give the
Jem'Hadar much time

860
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:36,976
to detect the
explosive either.

861
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,436
Commander, beam
down the canisters.

862
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,313
Canisters away.

863
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:42,315
I hope whoever's
in charge down there

864
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:44,025
hasn't taken a lunch break.

865
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:46,027
The Jem'Hadar
don't eat, Nog.

866
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:47,362
That's good.

867
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,821
How do we know
they're Jem'Hadar?

868
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,489
Relax, Cadet.
Everything's on schedule.

869
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,075
They've just beamed

870
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:54,452
84 canisters of white
into our cargo bay.

871
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,995
I've acknowledged
receipt

872
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,248
and requested clearance
for departure.

873
00:40:58,248 --> 00:40:59,582
Good. Prepare
to go to warp.

874
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,376
Standing by.

875
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,259
Captain, I think
we have a problem.

876
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:12,137
They've just raised
the security net.

877
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:14,222
Repeat our request
for clearance.

878
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:16,891
They're not responding.

879
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,145
If they don't
shut down that net

880
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:21,646
before the bomb goes off,
we don't have a chance.

881
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:24,190
One minute, 30 seconds
to detonation.

882
00:41:31,448 --> 00:41:33,574
Do you think
they found the bomb?

883
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,201
I doubt it, not this fast.

884
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,828
Then why aren't they
letting us go?

885
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:37,996
That's a good question.

886
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:39,205
Captain, they're responding.

887
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,915
They're ordering
us to stand by.

888
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:41,874
For what?

889
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:43,084
They're not saying.

890
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:44,461
One minute, 15 seconds.

891
00:41:44,461 --> 00:41:48,131
Chief, can we punch a hole
in the security net?

892
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:49,966
Sure, but it'll take
a couple of minutes.

893
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:52,010
We don't have a
couple of minutes.

894
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,762
What if we disable the
net's power generator?

895
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,097
The explosion will do that.

896
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:57,974
Well, that won't
do us much good.

897
00:41:57,974 --> 00:41:58,975
One minute.

898
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:00,559
Maybe it will.

899
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,312
When the generator's
destroyed,

900
00:42:02,312 --> 00:42:03,604
the net'll come down.

901
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:05,148
All we have to do
is to time it

902
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:06,399
so that we're
moving fast enough

903
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:07,900
at the moment
of detonation

904
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,403
to avoid being caught
in the explosion.

905
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:12,864
But not so fast
that we smash into the net

906
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:14,324
before it's deactivated.

907
00:42:14,324 --> 00:42:15,574
It's tricky.

908
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:18,370
Not if we time it right.

909
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:22,665
Let's see... a radial geodesic
in a 39 Cochrane warp field

910
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,209
contracts normal space

911
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:25,210
at a rate of--

912
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,503
We have to go to full impulse

913
00:42:26,503 --> 00:42:28,629
1.3 seconds
before the bomb detonates.

914
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:29,839
Dax?

915
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,590
The computer
agrees with Julian.

916
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,717
Of course it does.

917
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:33,843
They think alike.

918
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:35,136
Turning over

919
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:37,847
piloting controls
to the main computer.

920
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:39,015
Set.

921
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:40,058
Time?

922
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:42,018
22 seconds until the explosion.

923
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:43,144
22 seconds.

924
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:44,603
That's plenty of time.

925
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,439
See, Cadet? There was
nothing to worry about.

926
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:58,868
Must have gone off early.

927
00:42:58,868 --> 00:42:59,911
Dax, get us out of here!

928
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:22,767
Well, not quite
according to plan,

929
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:26,104
but I'm sure Starfleet
will be quite satisfied

930
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:27,355
with the results.

931
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:28,398
I agree, Mr. Garak.

932
00:43:28,398 --> 00:43:29,524
Well done, old man.

933
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,818
How bad is it, Chief?

934
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:34,529
It doesn't look good.

935
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:36,448
I'm going to have to switch
to auxiliary life support.

936
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:41,119
Deflectors are down,
guidance system's shot, and...

937
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,662
And what?

938
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,624
The core matrix is fried.

939
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,918
We don't have warp drive.

940
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:55,550
Uh, forgive my ignorance,
but if we don't have warp drive,

941
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,051
how long is it going
to take us

942
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:59,053
to reach the closest
Federation starbase?

943
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:01,806
A long time, Mr. Garak.

944
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:02,974
How long?

945
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:08,896
17 years, two months
and three days...

946
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:11,690
give or take an hour.
