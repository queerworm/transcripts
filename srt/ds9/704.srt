1
00:00:05,671 --> 00:00:07,163
Kira to Sisko.

2
00:00:07,275 --> 00:00:08,642
Go ahead, Colonel.

3
00:00:08,677 --> 00:00:12,014
Captain Solok of the Starship
<i>T'Kumbra</i> is here to see you.

4
00:00:15,726 --> 00:00:17,662
Send him in.

5
00:00:21,204 --> 00:00:24,143
Welcome to Deep Space 9,
Captain.

6
00:00:24,178 --> 00:00:26,205
Your welcome is acknowledged.

7
00:00:26,283 --> 00:00:27,512
Have a seat.

8
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:33,190
It's been a long time.

9
00:00:33,231 --> 00:00:35,532
Ten years, two months,
five days.

10
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,233
You mean you don't know it
to the minute?

11
00:00:37,274 --> 00:00:41,545
Of course I do, but humans are
often irked by such precision.

12
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:45,922
Especially the more
emotional humans.

13
00:00:45,959 --> 00:00:47,588
Our repair list.

14
00:00:51,805 --> 00:00:54,208
I understand
you were recently honored

15
00:00:54,244 --> 00:00:56,909
with the Christopher Pike Medal
for Valor.

16
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,419
Congratulations.

17
00:00:58,453 --> 00:01:00,480
Thank you.

18
00:01:00,525 --> 00:01:02,689
And congratulations to you.

19
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:06,134
I heard you received your medal
last month.

20
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,437
My second, actually.

21
00:01:08,475 --> 00:01:12,712
The <i>T'Kumbra</i> has been in combat
for over six months.

22
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:15,518
Spending time behind the lines
will be a welcome change.

23
00:01:15,558 --> 00:01:17,425
This isn't exactly
a safe harbor.

24
00:01:17,462 --> 00:01:19,261
We have seen
our share of action.

25
00:01:19,366 --> 00:01:22,270
Of course you have.

26
00:01:24,677 --> 00:01:27,274
We can upgrade
your inertial dampers

27
00:01:27,317 --> 00:01:28,877
by the end of the day

28
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:30,948
but to begin to overhaul
your warp core

29
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:32,392
will take at least a week.

30
00:01:32,428 --> 00:01:35,663
Oh, that is most inefficient.

31
00:01:35,702 --> 00:01:38,071
War is an inefficient business.

32
00:01:38,107 --> 00:01:40,977
A somewhat
unprofessional attitude.

33
00:01:41,013 --> 00:01:43,314
However, I've come to expect

34
00:01:43,419 --> 00:01:46,449
a lack of professionalism
and efficiency

35
00:01:46,493 --> 00:01:49,226
on starbases run
by human officers.

36
00:01:49,265 --> 00:01:52,966
You're welcome to take your ship
to a Vulcan station.

37
00:01:53,006 --> 00:01:56,207
I think there's one
about 50 light-years away.

38
00:01:56,247 --> 00:01:58,114
But if you're planning
to stay here with us...

39
00:01:58,151 --> 00:01:59,950
behind the lines

40
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:02,688
then my Chief of Operations
will see to your requests.

41
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:04,163
Very well.

42
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:12,814
There is another matter
not listed on the formal report.

43
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,820
I need use of a holosuite.

44
00:02:14,855 --> 00:02:18,124
The <i>T'Kumbra</i> holodecks
are currently under repair.

45
00:02:18,162 --> 00:02:21,624
To arrange holosuite time,
you have to go through Quark.

46
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,503
He owns the only ones
on the station.

47
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,442
Then I will speak to Quark.

48
00:02:25,477 --> 00:02:28,780
I have created a special program
for my senior staff

49
00:02:28,818 --> 00:02:31,187
and they are quite eager
to resume using it.

50
00:02:31,223 --> 00:02:32,191
Really?

51
00:02:32,225 --> 00:02:33,626
Yes.

52
00:02:33,662 --> 00:02:38,367
In fact, you may find
the program of some interest.

53
00:02:38,473 --> 00:02:42,004
It is based on an Earth game.

54
00:02:42,047 --> 00:02:44,074
And what game would that be?

55
00:02:50,867 --> 00:02:53,236
Colonel, assemble
the senior staff

56
00:02:53,272 --> 00:02:54,741
in the Wardroom now.

57
00:03:07,036 --> 00:03:11,102
As you probably know,
the Starship <i>T'Kumbra</i>

58
00:03:11,145 --> 00:03:12,512
is docked at our station.

59
00:03:12,548 --> 00:03:13,709
What you may not know

60
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,085
is that their Captain
considers his crew...

61
00:03:16,122 --> 00:03:20,029
an all Vulcan crew, by the way...
to be the finest in the fleet.

62
00:03:20,065 --> 00:03:23,505
I happen to think that
the people sitting at this table

63
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:26,067
comprise the finest crew
in the Quadrant.

64
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:27,306
You're not going to get

65
00:03:27,347 --> 00:03:29,317
much of an argument
from this group.

66
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:30,820
I didn't think so.

67
00:03:30,855 --> 00:03:33,885
Which is why when their Captain
challenged us to a contest

68
00:03:33,928 --> 00:03:36,924
of courage, teamwork
and sacrifice

69
00:03:36,968 --> 00:03:38,835
I accepted on your behalf.

70
00:03:38,872 --> 00:03:40,341
We will destroy them.

71
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,436
I was hoping for that reaction.

72
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,450
So when is
this clash of the titans?

73
00:03:44,485 --> 00:03:46,979
Two weeks in Holosuite 5.

74
00:03:47,023 --> 00:03:48,082
What's the contest?

75
00:03:51,032 --> 00:03:53,367
Baseball.

76
00:05:57,683 --> 00:06:00,519
"Chapter 25:
The infield fly rule

77
00:06:00,556 --> 00:06:02,287
"is invoked in instances where

78
00:06:02,326 --> 00:06:04,353
"with both first base
and second base occupied

79
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:06,425
"or with first, second
and third base occupied...

80
00:06:06,502 --> 00:06:07,697
What if there is
a runner at home?

81
00:06:07,738 --> 00:06:09,173
There's never a runner at home.

82
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:12,444
Okay, uh..."and
fewer than two outs

83
00:06:12,481 --> 00:06:14,748
the batter hits a high fly..."

84
00:06:21,335 --> 00:06:22,804
"Fly: The term

85
00:06:22,838 --> 00:06:25,139
for a batted ball
while it is in the air."

86
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:27,910
Oh, right.
Uh, uh, "fewer than two outs

87
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:28,974
"the batter hits a high fly...

88
00:06:29,018 --> 00:06:30,954
"which in the judgment
of the umpire

89
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,721
"can readily be caught
by an infielder

90
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,231
"or the pitcher or catcher
inside fair ground.

91
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:36,599
"The batter is then called out

92
00:06:36,635 --> 00:06:39,471
regardless of whether the ball
is subsequently caught or not."

93
00:06:39,508 --> 00:06:40,875
That seems simple enough.

94
00:06:40,911 --> 00:06:43,007
"An attempt to bunt

95
00:06:43,049 --> 00:06:46,022

"which results in a fair fly

shall not be regarded
an infield fly."

98
00:06:50,499 --> 00:06:52,800
What's a bunt?

99
00:06:52,837 --> 00:06:53,805
A bunt:

100
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:55,206
A ball that has been
deliberately tapped

101
00:06:55,243 --> 00:06:57,179
into the area between
the pitcher and the catcher

102
00:06:57,213 --> 00:06:59,810
by the batter in order to force
the fielding side

103
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:02,483
to throw out the batter
and allow a runner to advance.

104
00:07:02,525 --> 00:07:05,156
Right.
Chief, what's a grand slam?

105
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:11,166
Uh... a home run that's hit
when the bases are crowded.

106
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:13,409
Right,
except it's "bases loaded."

107
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,249
Now...

108
00:07:15,287 --> 00:07:16,346
what's a "Fancy Dan"?

109
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:17,414
You're making that up.

110
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,893
I most certainly am not.

111
00:07:21,835 --> 00:07:22,860
Hi.

112
00:07:22,903 --> 00:07:24,896
Jake told us about the game

113
00:07:24,941 --> 00:07:26,410
against the Vulcans.

114
00:07:26,444 --> 00:07:28,380
It sounds really exciting.

115
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:29,748
You should come watch.

116
00:07:29,785 --> 00:07:32,655
"Fancy Dan: A fielder who puts
an extra flourish

117
00:07:32,692 --> 00:07:34,890
"on his movements
while making a play

118
00:07:34,929 --> 00:07:37,833
in hopes of gaining the approval
of the spectators."

119
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,669
Actually, we were
thinking of doing

120
00:07:39,707 --> 00:07:40,732
more than watching.

121
00:07:40,776 --> 00:07:42,245
If we can.

122
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:46,345
That is, if there's still room
for other potential players

123
00:07:46,388 --> 00:07:48,187
to possibly try and...

124
00:07:48,225 --> 00:07:49,854
We want to try out.

125
00:07:49,896 --> 00:07:51,125
Nog always talks about

126
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,467
how Captain Sisko
and Jake play baseball

127
00:07:53,504 --> 00:07:55,201
and how it brings them
closer together.

128
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,209
Since Nog and I

129
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:57,610
haven't seen much
of each other lately

130
00:07:57,646 --> 00:07:59,240
I thought this might
be a good way

131
00:07:59,283 --> 00:08:00,752
of spending some time together.

132
00:08:00,786 --> 00:08:03,137
And I decided to make it
a complete family outing.

133
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,796
That is so sweet.

134
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,808
Isn't it?

135
00:08:05,842 --> 00:08:07,037
Idiotic is what it is.

136
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:09,516
You're going to make a fool
out of yourself.

137
00:08:09,551 --> 00:08:11,418
I will not.

138
00:08:11,455 --> 00:08:13,619
You can barely spin a dabo wheel

139
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,493
much less kick a ball
around a field.

140
00:08:15,531 --> 00:08:17,467
Shows how much you know.

141
00:08:17,501 --> 00:08:19,631
You don't kick the ball...

142
00:08:19,673 --> 00:08:21,006
do you?

143
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:23,639
You won't make the team.

144
00:08:23,682 --> 00:08:24,809
At least we're trying out.

145
00:08:24,851 --> 00:08:25,841
What about you?

146
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,655
I don't have the slightest
interest in this hu-man game.

147
00:08:30,697 --> 00:08:31,926
You know why?

148
00:08:32,034 --> 00:08:34,505
Jake says it's a game
that takes heart

149
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:36,840
and you sold yours
a long time ago.

150
00:08:36,878 --> 00:08:38,039
Come on, Rom.

151
00:08:42,056 --> 00:08:44,186
What time are tryouts?

152
00:08:44,227 --> 00:08:46,391
1300, Holosuite 4.

153
00:08:55,852 --> 00:08:56,979
Hey, hey!

154
00:08:57,022 --> 00:08:58,491
All right!

155
00:08:58,525 --> 00:09:00,324
Ha, ha, whoo!

156
00:09:00,363 --> 00:09:02,196
Yes!

157
00:09:03,302 --> 00:09:05,865
First day of practice
and it's an exciting time!

158
00:09:05,908 --> 00:09:06,933
Am I right?

159
00:09:06,977 --> 00:09:08,742
Oh, yeah.

160
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:09,749
Yeah! There we go.
There we go.

161
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:10,808
That's the spirit!

162
00:09:10,852 --> 00:09:12,719
Now, first let me introduce
you to our pitcher

163
00:09:12,757 --> 00:09:16,823
and our secret weapon,
Jake "The Slider" Sisko!

164
00:09:16,865 --> 00:09:17,628
Good luck, Jake.

165
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:18,635
- The Slider.
- Very nice.

166
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,367
Now, all the other positions

167
00:09:20,407 --> 00:09:22,640
are still open for tryouts.

168
00:09:22,678 --> 00:09:24,147
Now, every one of you here today

169
00:09:24,181 --> 00:09:27,450
has seen at least
one baseball game

170
00:09:27,489 --> 00:09:28,753
with me in the holosuite.

171
00:09:28,792 --> 00:09:31,389
Now, I know it looks simple...

172
00:09:31,431 --> 00:09:34,461
you throw the ball, you catch
the ball, you hit the ball...

173
00:09:34,505 --> 00:09:36,407
but it is not that easy.

174
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,139
It's a difficult game.

175
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:41,846
It was a difficult game to play
even for seasoned professionals

176
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,017
who spent their
lifetime practicing.

177
00:09:44,092 --> 00:09:45,025
And now we have

178
00:09:45,094 --> 00:09:47,327
less than two weeks
to build a team

179
00:09:47,366 --> 00:09:49,929
and to face the opponent.

180
00:09:49,971 --> 00:09:52,807
Now, I know
what some of you are thinking.

181
00:09:52,845 --> 00:09:56,410
"How are we going to beat
the Logicians?

182
00:09:56,453 --> 00:09:57,786
"They're all Vulcans.

183
00:09:57,823 --> 00:10:00,294
"They're stronger and faster
than any one of us...

184
00:10:00,328 --> 00:10:01,387
"except for Worf

185
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:05,531
and our genetically
enhanced doctor."

186
00:10:05,573 --> 00:10:08,876
But there is more to baseball
than physical strength.

187
00:10:08,913 --> 00:10:11,544
It's, uh...

188
00:10:11,586 --> 00:10:14,285
it's about courage...

189
00:10:14,325 --> 00:10:17,787
and it's also about faith

190
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:22,104
and it is also about heart

191
00:10:22,142 --> 00:10:24,272
and if there's one thing

192
00:10:24,313 --> 00:10:27,753
our Vulcan friends lack,
it's heart.

193
00:10:27,787 --> 00:10:31,660
I think we can beat them.

194
00:10:31,696 --> 00:10:33,256
I know we can beat them.

195
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,325
Yep.

196
00:10:34,369 --> 00:10:36,772
We are going to beat them!

197
00:10:36,807 --> 00:10:38,299
- Am I right?
- Yeah!

198
00:10:38,344 --> 00:10:40,314
I can't hear you.

199
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,840
Yes, sir!

200
00:10:41,885 --> 00:10:44,083
Are we going
to beat the Vulcans?

201
00:10:44,124 --> 00:10:45,092
I can't hear you!

202
00:10:45,126 --> 00:10:46,390
Yes, sir!

203
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:48,957
All right, then.
Let's play some baseball!

204
00:10:49,001 --> 00:10:50,834
First, I want you
to pair off.

205
00:10:50,872 --> 00:10:53,366
Spread yourselves
about ten meters apart

206
00:10:53,411 --> 00:10:55,005
and, uh, play some catch.

207
00:10:55,048 --> 00:10:57,519
Have fun.

208
00:10:57,553 --> 00:11:01,494
Yeah. Just a little, uh,
throw and catch.

209
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:02,930
Nice and easy.

210
00:11:05,638 --> 00:11:06,937
You almost had it.

211
00:11:10,281 --> 00:11:12,046
I said, throw it here.

212
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,691
Don't throw it to her.

213
00:11:18,734 --> 00:11:21,467
You've got to throw it
to someone who's looking at you.

214
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,741
Oh, come on, Quark.

215
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:35,168
This is going to be
two long, hard weeks.

216
00:11:35,202 --> 00:11:38,334
Jake, I don't care
how hard and long

217
00:11:38,376 --> 00:11:40,346
these two weeks are

218
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,011
but I'm not going
to lose to Solok

219
00:11:43,054 --> 00:11:44,421
in a baseball game.

220
00:11:44,456 --> 00:11:46,950
We are going to win.

221
00:11:51,772 --> 00:11:53,139
Umpire?

222
00:11:53,176 --> 00:11:54,440
That's right.
Will you do it?

223
00:11:54,478 --> 00:11:58,681
Well, wouldn't
a holographic umpire

224
00:11:58,721 --> 00:11:59,985
be more accurate?

225
00:12:00,024 --> 00:12:02,894
I don't want a computer program
calling a baseball game.

226
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,456
That's something Solok
would do.

227
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,527
I want a real person
behind the plate

228
00:12:06,572 --> 00:12:10,479
not just some collection
of photons and magnetic fields.

229
00:12:10,514 --> 00:12:14,010
I-I-I also want a person who
can be completely impartial

230
00:12:14,055 --> 00:12:17,085
and I can't think
of anyone I trust more.

231
00:12:17,128 --> 00:12:18,722
Well, that's, uh...

232
00:12:18,765 --> 00:12:20,564
that's very flattering.

233
00:12:20,603 --> 00:12:22,368
Oh, it's the truth.
Will you do it?

234
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:26,239
All right.

235
00:12:26,281 --> 00:12:27,249
Outstanding.

236
00:12:27,351 --> 00:12:28,250
Here are the rules.

237
00:12:28,353 --> 00:12:29,879
Uh, if you have any questions

238
00:12:29,923 --> 00:12:31,552
I'll be with the team
in the Infirmary.

239
00:12:31,593 --> 00:12:32,720
The Infirmary?

240
00:12:32,762 --> 00:12:36,031
Ah, we had a few problems
at practice today.

241
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:38,438
Remember, the game is
in less than two weeks.

242
00:12:38,475 --> 00:12:40,969
So you better start
to, uh, work on your moves.

243
00:12:44,354 --> 00:12:46,256
My moves?

244
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:47,282
I can't believe this.

245
00:12:47,328 --> 00:12:48,797
I used to be an athlete.

246
00:12:48,831 --> 00:12:50,824
At least, I remember
being an athlete.

247
00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:53,397
My third host, Emony,
was an Olympic gymnast.

248
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:56,072
I keep expecting my legs
to react like hers did

249
00:12:56,113 --> 00:12:58,209
but I fell all over myself.

250
00:12:58,252 --> 00:13:00,279
It's like I don't know
my own body anymore.

251
00:13:00,323 --> 00:13:02,453
I don't know what
you're complaining about.

252
00:13:02,494 --> 00:13:07,130
At least you didn't
require major surgery.

253
00:13:07,171 --> 00:13:08,504
Knitting together
a couple of bones

254
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,477
is not major surgery, Quark.

255
00:13:10,511 --> 00:13:14,110
It is if the bones
are in the back of your skull.

256
00:13:16,525 --> 00:13:18,962
I hope you learned
your lesson.

257
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,834
Always look behind you
before swinging a bat.

258
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,897
So, how are my casualties doing?

259
00:13:23,942 --> 00:13:24,910
We'll live.

260
00:13:24,944 --> 00:13:26,105
If you believe Julian.

261
00:13:26,146 --> 00:13:27,672
Personally, I'm not sure
I'm going to make it.

262
00:13:27,716 --> 00:13:28,980
That's the spirit, old man.

263
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,512
Don't lose your sense of humor.

264
00:13:32,126 --> 00:13:34,324
Hey, Chief, how's the shoulder?

265
00:13:34,431 --> 00:13:35,764
He's out, I'm afraid.

266
00:13:35,801 --> 00:13:37,464
His rotator cuff was badly torn.

267
00:13:37,505 --> 00:13:38,700
Can't you repair the damage?

268
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,935
I need him on third,

269
00:13:39,977 --> 00:13:41,947
and he's anchoring
the second half of the lineup.

270
00:13:41,981 --> 00:13:43,280
I've repaired
the rotator cuff

271
00:13:43,318 --> 00:13:45,185
but the ligaments need time
to knit together

272
00:13:45,221 --> 00:13:46,348
with the clavicular joint.

273
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:47,893
I can't let him play baseball.

274
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:48,952
Damn!

275
00:13:48,997 --> 00:13:50,364
I'm sorry, sir.

276
00:13:50,466 --> 00:13:52,129
I was really looking
forward to the game.

277
00:13:53,406 --> 00:13:56,538
Well, there's an old saying...
"those who can't... coach."

278
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,576
As for now, you are batting,
pitching and first base coach.

279
00:13:59,619 --> 00:14:01,749
Oh, great.

280
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:04,160
Which one is first base?

281
00:14:04,197 --> 00:14:06,293
We'll go over that again later.

282
00:14:06,334 --> 00:14:10,069
All right. Practice
tomorrow morning at 0730.

283
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,237
Don't be late.

284
00:14:12,382 --> 00:14:13,350
We'll be there.

285
00:14:13,384 --> 00:14:14,352
Well, if you excuse me

286
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:16,482
I still have to realign
Worf's zygomatic bone.

287
00:14:16,524 --> 00:14:17,617
Ow.

288
00:14:18,996 --> 00:14:21,832
Tell him I'm sorry.

289
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:24,931
Ah, we can move Ezri
over to third.

290
00:14:24,976 --> 00:14:26,240
No, no, no,
I need her in center.

291
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:27,507
Ooh! I know who we can get.

292
00:14:27,548 --> 00:14:29,484
I'll have to pull some strings,
but I think I can do it.

293
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,509
Who?

294
00:14:42,113 --> 00:14:43,639
Welcome home.

295
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:46,314
Oh, music to my ears.

296
00:14:47,325 --> 00:14:49,352
Mmm. Does this mean
you missed me?

297
00:14:49,396 --> 00:14:52,335
Like a piece
of my heart was missing.

298
00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:53,668
Oh, sweet words.

299
00:14:53,705 --> 00:14:56,472
And flowers, too?

300
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:58,848
Are you feeling all right?

301
00:14:58,883 --> 00:15:01,047
Now that you're back,
I feel outstanding.

302
00:15:01,088 --> 00:15:03,389
Oh, I could get used to this.

303
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,225
And well you should... are
you going to be here long?

304
00:15:05,264 --> 00:15:06,597
Um, as a matter of fact

305
00:15:06,634 --> 00:15:09,401
my next three cargo runs
have been reassigned.

306
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,408
Really?

307
00:15:10,475 --> 00:15:11,408
Oh, bureaucrats...

308
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:13,003
who knows why they do anything?

309
00:15:13,047 --> 00:15:14,174
Who knows?

310
00:15:14,217 --> 00:15:15,550
So...

311
00:15:16,656 --> 00:15:19,823
what are we going to do
with all my time off?

312
00:15:19,863 --> 00:15:21,264
I have a few ideas.

313
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:22,267
I bet you do.

314
00:15:22,301 --> 00:15:23,428
So tell me

315
00:15:23,471 --> 00:15:25,635
how's your throwing
arm holding up?

316
00:15:31,923 --> 00:15:32,872
There you go, Kas!

317
00:15:33,005 --> 00:15:35,203
That's what I'm talking about.

318
00:15:35,311 --> 00:15:37,441
All right.
Head's up, people.

319
00:15:37,482 --> 00:15:40,147
There's a runner on first,
one away.

320
00:15:43,762 --> 00:15:44,957
I got it!

321
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:47,368
I got it! I got it!

322
00:15:49,642 --> 00:15:50,610
Oh!

323
00:15:50,644 --> 00:15:52,113
How many is that?

324
00:15:52,147 --> 00:15:53,342
Today?

325
00:15:53,384 --> 00:15:55,821
I think he's missed ten.

326
00:16:09,686 --> 00:16:11,679
Damn.

327
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:19,297
All right. Batting practice.

328
00:16:27,425 --> 00:16:29,395
What's he doing here?

329
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,990
He's scouting us.

330
00:16:33,372 --> 00:16:36,368
If he is taking the time
to conduct reconnaissance

331
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:38,005
he must be worried.

332
00:16:38,048 --> 00:16:39,016
He should be.

333
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,578
Next week on this field,
that man is going to get

334
00:16:41,623 --> 00:16:43,217
a painful lesson in humility.

335
00:16:48,972 --> 00:16:50,635
Batter up.

336
00:16:57,758 --> 00:17:00,731
Today, I'm going
to hit the ball.

337
00:17:00,764 --> 00:17:02,199
You just watch.

338
00:17:10,052 --> 00:17:11,281
Oh!

339
00:17:15,631 --> 00:17:18,604
All right, Rom,
remember what we talked about.

340
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:19,731
Keep your eye on the ball.

341
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:22,210
Follow the ball
from the pitcher's hands

342
00:17:22,245 --> 00:17:23,839
all the way to the bat.

343
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,198
Oh!

344
00:17:37,412 --> 00:17:39,348
Sorry.

345
00:17:39,383 --> 00:17:40,647
You can do it.

346
00:17:40,686 --> 00:17:42,178
Hang in there, Rom.

347
00:17:42,223 --> 00:17:43,452
All right, Rom.

348
00:17:51,576 --> 00:17:52,737
Oh-oh.

349
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:54,408
Sorry.

350
00:17:57,522 --> 00:17:58,786
That's it.
You're done.

351
00:17:58,826 --> 00:18:01,059
I'll do better tomorrow,
Captain.

352
00:18:01,098 --> 00:18:02,066
No, you won't.

353
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,068
You are finished. Gone.

354
00:18:03,102 --> 00:18:04,070
Off the team.

355
00:18:04,104 --> 00:18:05,596
Sir, can't you give him
another chance...

356
00:18:05,641 --> 00:18:07,338
Is anyone talking to you,
Ensign?

357
00:18:07,411 --> 00:18:08,504
I can't play?

358
00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:10,814
That's the smartest
thing you said all week.

359
00:18:10,852 --> 00:18:12,845
You can't play.
Now, get your gear.

360
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,860
Get out of here.
Worf, you're up.

361
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,517
Captain Sisko hates me.

362
00:18:30,562 --> 00:18:32,293
He doesn't hate you, Rom.

363
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,200
Sisko was just
blowing off steam.

364
00:18:34,236 --> 00:18:35,261
He'll get over it.

365
00:18:35,306 --> 00:18:36,365
That's right.

366
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:38,139
I'll go talk with
him in the morning.

367
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:39,580
Maybe he'll change his...

368
00:18:39,615 --> 00:18:42,348
No! I don't want him to kick
you off the team, too.

369
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:43,857
I don't care about the team.

370
00:18:43,891 --> 00:18:45,690
If you can't play,
I won't, either.

371
00:18:45,729 --> 00:18:47,596
- Oh, that goes for me, too.
- And me.

372
00:18:47,633 --> 00:18:49,125
And us.

373
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,105
Benjamin was way
out of line today, Rom.

374
00:18:51,141 --> 00:18:52,940
Yeah. This game is
supposed to be fun

375
00:18:52,978 --> 00:18:54,447
not a life-and-death struggle.

376
00:18:54,515 --> 00:18:55,642
So we've decided to quit

377
00:18:55,684 --> 00:18:57,449
unless he reinstates
you immediately.

378
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:58,544
No! Please!

379
00:18:58,591 --> 00:18:59,559
Rom...

380
00:18:59,593 --> 00:19:00,788
we're on your side.

381
00:19:00,828 --> 00:19:02,924
I don't want to make
the team like this.

382
00:19:02,967 --> 00:19:05,234
I had my chance,
but I wasn't good enough.

383
00:19:05,272 --> 00:19:07,505
Let's face it...
the Captain's right.

384
00:19:07,543 --> 00:19:08,533
I'm hopeless.

385
00:19:08,579 --> 00:19:10,344
I don't deserve
to be on the team.

386
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:11,852
You play.
You've earned it.

387
00:19:11,887 --> 00:19:13,356
Playing baseball doesn't
mean anything to me.

388
00:19:13,389 --> 00:19:14,357
But it should.

389
00:19:14,392 --> 00:19:15,656
You're good at it.

390
00:19:15,694 --> 00:19:18,131
So are you, and I
want to see you play.

391
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:19,932
I want to see all of you play.

392
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:23,535
I want to see our team
beat the Vulcans

393
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,677
even if I'm only watching
from the... the, uh...

394
00:19:26,718 --> 00:19:27,845
The stands.

395
00:19:27,888 --> 00:19:28,947
Right.

396
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,289
Please?

397
00:19:31,663 --> 00:19:35,296
If, uh... that's the way
you feel about it.

398
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:39,008
Rom, there are moments

399
00:19:39,046 --> 00:19:43,112
when I know exactly
why I married you.

400
00:19:45,861 --> 00:19:46,954
What are you eating?

401
00:19:46,997 --> 00:19:48,296
I'm not eating.
I'm chewing.

402
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,460
Chewing what?

403
00:19:49,503 --> 00:19:50,630
Gum. It's traditional.

404
00:19:50,671 --> 00:19:52,402
I had the replicator
create me some.

405
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:53,501
They just chewed it?

406
00:19:53,612 --> 00:19:55,605
No, they infused
the gum with flavor.

407
00:19:55,649 --> 00:19:57,209
What did you infuse it with?

408
00:19:57,253 --> 00:19:58,950
Scotch.

409
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,325
Here. Try some.

410
00:20:04,769 --> 00:20:05,964
Hmm.

411
00:20:09,145 --> 00:20:10,910
All right.
You got a runner on first.

412
00:20:10,949 --> 00:20:12,384
You got a runner on second.

413
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,321
One away. Ground ball
to the second baseman.

414
00:20:14,356 --> 00:20:15,483
Kira, what do you do?

415
00:20:15,526 --> 00:20:16,721
I go for the double play

416
00:20:16,762 --> 00:20:18,561
unless the runner
on third is already

417
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:20,364
on his way home, in which case...

418
00:20:20,404 --> 00:20:21,565
Okay, relax

419
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:24,008
and keep your weight
on the balls of your feet.

420
00:20:24,045 --> 00:20:25,844
Back elbow up.

421
00:20:25,882 --> 00:20:28,410
Yeah. Good.

422
00:20:28,454 --> 00:20:29,821
Yeah.

423
00:20:32,029 --> 00:20:33,396
Faster.
Come on, come on.

424
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,699
Faster. Come on,
come on...

425
00:20:35,737 --> 00:20:37,036
Come on! Come on!

426
00:20:37,074 --> 00:20:38,042
Faster!

427
00:20:38,076 --> 00:20:39,340
Ooh, yeah! Good!

428
00:20:39,378 --> 00:20:40,346
- I got it!
- Mine!

429
00:20:40,381 --> 00:20:41,371
I got it!

430
00:20:42,652 --> 00:20:43,711
Well, don't look at me!

431
00:20:43,755 --> 00:20:44,984
- You called it!
- You should have got it.

432
00:20:45,024 --> 00:20:46,721
- I was out of position!
- That was yours all the way!

433
00:20:46,761 --> 00:20:48,196
Oh, come on, Julian.

434
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:00,780
Safe!

435
00:21:02,864 --> 00:21:03,763
Safe!

436
00:21:05,403 --> 00:21:07,339
Safe!

437
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:11,446
You're out!

438
00:21:13,053 --> 00:21:14,248
You're out!

439
00:21:17,595 --> 00:21:19,155
Oh, that's quite a knot.

440
00:21:21,538 --> 00:21:24,408
Your back is like a minefield
of bruised muscles.

441
00:21:24,444 --> 00:21:28,111
You tell me something
I don't know. Ow!

442
00:21:28,152 --> 00:21:29,245
Okay.

443
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,284
You're lifting your foot up
at the plate.

444
00:21:32,328 --> 00:21:34,025
What?

445
00:21:34,065 --> 00:21:35,534
Okay. Take a swing.

446
00:21:53,374 --> 00:21:54,103
Wait.

447
00:21:54,143 --> 00:21:56,239
Stop.
Right there. Look.

448
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:58,183
You're lifting your foot
in the backswing.

449
00:21:58,218 --> 00:22:00,348
It's been messing up
your whole rhythm.

450
00:22:01,425 --> 00:22:02,586
Not that bad.

451
00:22:03,998 --> 00:22:05,490
I know that look.

452
00:22:05,535 --> 00:22:07,027
It's the I'd-really-
like-to-smash-something-

453
00:22:07,027 --> 00:22:08,154
It's the I'd-really-
like-to-smash-something-

454
00:22:08,196 --> 00:22:10,063
but-she'll-think-I'm-crazy look.

455
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,967
Well, don't let me stop you.

456
00:22:12,003 --> 00:22:13,232
They're your quarters.

457
00:22:13,273 --> 00:22:15,140
Smash away,
if it'll make you feel better.

458
00:22:15,177 --> 00:22:16,202
The only way I'll

459
00:22:16,247 --> 00:22:18,343
feel better
is to beat Solok tomorrow.

460
00:22:18,384 --> 00:22:22,017
So, do I get to hear
the Solok story now?

461
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,429
And before you say no,
you'd better consider the fact

462
00:22:24,464 --> 00:22:27,129
that if you don't tell me,
you won't have a third baseman.

463
00:22:31,313 --> 00:22:35,118
We were in the same class
at the Academy, you know.

464
00:22:35,155 --> 00:22:37,148
One weekend I was
with some friends

465
00:22:37,193 --> 00:22:39,528
at an off-campus bar...
the Launching Pad...

466
00:22:39,565 --> 00:22:44,098
and Solok came in
with some Vulcan Cadets

467
00:22:44,141 --> 00:22:46,134
who said
they were doing research

468
00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:49,550
on illogical
human bonding rituals.

469
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,784
We didn't take kindly to that.

470
00:22:51,824 --> 00:22:53,691
And you'd... had a few drinks.

471
00:22:53,728 --> 00:22:56,564
Yeah... one or two.

472
00:22:56,602 --> 00:22:59,575
Well, we got into a debate,
and Solok said

473
00:22:59,676 --> 00:23:03,515
that Vulcans were
naturally superior to humans

474
00:23:03,584 --> 00:23:07,251
and other "emotionally
handicapped" species.

475
00:23:07,292 --> 00:23:09,525
Of course, I took
the opposite position.

476
00:23:09,563 --> 00:23:12,798
So... there I am...

477
00:23:12,837 --> 00:23:17,871
drunk... and debating
logic versus emotion

478
00:23:17,915 --> 00:23:21,013
with a smug...
and very sober Vulcan.

479
00:23:21,055 --> 00:23:23,253
Well, to make

480
00:23:23,294 --> 00:23:26,095
a long story short, I decided
that the best way to prove

481
00:23:26,133 --> 00:23:29,129
that humans were every bit
the equal of Vulcans

482
00:23:29,173 --> 00:23:31,838
was to challenge him
to a wrestling match.

483
00:23:31,879 --> 00:23:32,847
Wrestling?

484
00:23:32,881 --> 00:23:34,008
All I wanted to do

485
00:23:34,051 --> 00:23:35,782
was to wipe that arrogant look
off his face

486
00:23:35,821 --> 00:23:39,694
so in the heat of the moment...
I challenged him.

487
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,700
And?

488
00:23:41,734 --> 00:23:45,869
I, uh... ended up
in the Infirmary...

489
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:49,441
with a separated shoulder,
two cracked ribs

490
00:23:49,484 --> 00:23:52,719
and a very bruised ego.

491
00:23:52,758 --> 00:23:54,625
Oh, Ben...

492
00:23:54,697 --> 00:23:57,829
I don't... no, I
don't mean to laugh

493
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:59,965
but... what did you expect?

494
00:24:00,008 --> 00:24:04,416
A Vulcan has three times
the strength of a human.

495
00:24:05,453 --> 00:24:06,945
And they're faster, too.

496
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:08,424
But you're right.

497
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,590
I got what I deserved.

498
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:13,603
And if it had ended right there

499
00:24:13,704 --> 00:24:15,834
it would've been fine,
but it didn't.

500
00:24:15,876 --> 00:24:19,407
Solok took every opportunity
to remind me of our match.

501
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:22,217
He used to point me out whenever
I walked across the campus.

502
00:24:22,257 --> 00:24:24,626
In fact, he wrote
five psychology papers

503
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:26,096
about our match.

504
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:27,761
I became the living embodiment

505
00:24:27,802 --> 00:24:31,242
of why Vulcans were
inherently superior to humans.

506
00:24:31,276 --> 00:24:33,645
You don't mean he was gloating?
A Vulcan?

507
00:24:33,715 --> 00:24:34,979
That's exactly what I mean.

508
00:24:35,018 --> 00:24:38,082
He may have hidden it
beneath that Vulcan calm

509
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:41,587
but... he loved
every minute of it.

510
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:47,343
And you'd think
that once we graduated

511
00:24:47,379 --> 00:24:49,212
it would've stopped,
but it didn't.

512
00:24:49,249 --> 00:24:52,586
Over the years,
Solok wrote over a dozen papers

513
00:24:52,623 --> 00:24:55,527
on Vulcan/human
comparative profiles...

514
00:24:55,564 --> 00:24:58,161
and in the beginning
of every paper...

515
00:24:58,203 --> 00:25:01,176
is an analysis of that...

516
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:03,908
damned wrestling match.

517
00:25:03,949 --> 00:25:07,013
And now he comes to your station
and announces

518
00:25:07,055 --> 00:25:09,322
that he's put together
a baseball team.

519
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,262
He doesn't care about baseball.

520
00:25:11,297 --> 00:25:13,894
All he wants to do is to rub
my nose in it one more time

521
00:25:13,937 --> 00:25:16,933
but now he is using my game.
My game!

522
00:25:16,977 --> 00:25:19,038
You should tell that
to the Niners.

523
00:25:19,082 --> 00:25:21,815
They don't understand
why you're so caught up in this.

524
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:24,087
Oh, no, I'd rather they think

525
00:25:24,126 --> 00:25:26,187
I'm just caught up
in some baseball game

526
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:30,866
than pursuing...
an adolescent rivalry.

527
00:25:30,908 --> 00:25:32,343
Just tell them the truth.

528
00:25:32,378 --> 00:25:33,813
They'll understand.

529
00:25:33,847 --> 00:25:36,478
They need to know how personal
this is to you.

530
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,183
Oh, no.

531
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,393
No.

532
00:25:43,435 --> 00:25:44,460
I mean it.

533
00:25:44,504 --> 00:25:48,171
And you can't tell them, either.

534
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:55,756
I want you to promise me.

535
00:25:58,802 --> 00:25:59,929
All right.

536
00:26:01,374 --> 00:26:03,173
I promise.

537
00:26:03,212 --> 00:26:04,373
He made me promise
not to tell you

538
00:26:04,414 --> 00:26:06,179
so you'll have to keep this
under your hats.

539
00:26:06,218 --> 00:26:07,413
Curzon and Jadzia

540
00:26:07,455 --> 00:26:09,448
always wondered why
Benjamin hated Solok

541
00:26:09,492 --> 00:26:10,721
but he'd never talk about it.

542
00:26:10,762 --> 00:26:12,026
Well, he's embarrassed.

543
00:26:12,064 --> 00:26:14,695
He's calling it
an "adolescent rivalry"

544
00:26:14,737 --> 00:26:16,707
but Solok's the one
that's kept this thing going.

545
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:17,937
And now he's trying

546
00:26:17,977 --> 00:26:19,310
to beat the Captain
at his own game.

547
00:26:20,349 --> 00:26:21,750
It is a dishonorable motive.

548
00:26:21,786 --> 00:26:24,257
I'm beginning
to hate him myself.

549
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,193
So, what are we going
to do about it?

550
00:26:26,229 --> 00:26:27,664
I tell you what we do.

551
00:26:27,699 --> 00:26:29,032
We go out there tomorrow

552
00:26:29,069 --> 00:26:31,096
and we put that Vulcan
in his place.

553
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,199
We win it for the Captain.

554
00:26:32,242 --> 00:26:35,477
And for all our "emotionally
handicapped" races.

555
00:26:35,516 --> 00:26:38,079
Now, there's something
worth fighting for, right?

556
00:26:45,706 --> 00:26:47,973
- Niners!
- Niners!

557
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,142
Okay, laddies, let's go.

558
00:28:04,178 --> 00:28:06,945
Let's go. Come on.
Let's show these guys.

559
00:28:12,028 --> 00:28:15,695
Look, let's, uh, dispense
with the crowd.

560
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:19,005
My team has never played
in front of people before.

561
00:28:19,043 --> 00:28:21,879
If you wish.

562
00:28:21,983 --> 00:28:25,388
Computer, eliminate
the spectators.

563
00:28:25,424 --> 00:28:27,793
Play ball!

564
00:28:31,772 --> 00:28:33,765
Batter up!

565
00:28:40,223 --> 00:28:41,886
All right, Niners,
Let's hear some chatter.

566
00:28:41,927 --> 00:28:43,362
Hey, batter, batter,
batter, batter, batter!

567
00:28:43,397 --> 00:28:46,164
Hey, batter, batter, batter,
batter, batter, batter, batter!

568
00:28:46,203 --> 00:28:47,934
Death to the opposition.

569
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,373
Hey, batter, swing, batter.

570
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:50,743
Strike him out!

571
00:29:00,568 --> 00:29:01,901
Lucky swing.

572
00:29:01,938 --> 00:29:03,635
All right.

573
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:05,910
Hey, don't worry.

574
00:29:06,014 --> 00:29:07,449
You'll get the next one, okay?

575
00:29:07,483 --> 00:29:09,579
Okay?

576
00:29:09,621 --> 00:29:11,250
Okay.

577
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,555
All right.

578
00:29:36,665 --> 00:29:37,724
All right.

579
00:29:37,768 --> 00:29:39,704
You're making mental
errors out there.

580
00:29:39,739 --> 00:29:41,072
Stupid mistakes.

581
00:29:41,109 --> 00:29:43,273
You have to start thinking
about what you're doing.

582
00:29:43,313 --> 00:29:44,942
Colonel, you have
to charge the ball.

583
00:29:44,984 --> 00:29:46,578
Don't wait for it
to come to you.

584
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,112
Ezri, you're playing too deep!

585
00:29:49,828 --> 00:29:51,354
They rattled you.

586
00:29:51,398 --> 00:29:52,731
Yeah. They're pretty good.

587
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:55,069
What are you talking about,
they're pretty good?

588
00:29:55,107 --> 00:29:56,406
You better stop admiring them

589
00:29:56,509 --> 00:29:57,842
and start striking them out!

590
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,074
Batter up!

591
00:29:59,115 --> 00:30:00,584
Let's play ball.

592
00:30:02,489 --> 00:30:04,322
Strike three.

593
00:30:04,961 --> 00:30:07,364
Strike three.

594
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:11,268
Strike three.

595
00:30:14,114 --> 00:30:15,845
Let's go!

596
00:30:34,025 --> 00:30:34,788
Out!

597
00:30:34,827 --> 00:30:37,697
You want to try that again?

598
00:30:37,733 --> 00:30:39,225
Hey, hey, hey!
Colonel, stay cool.

599
00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:41,330
Don't do anything
to get yourself thrown out.

600
00:30:41,374 --> 00:30:43,937
Wouldn't dream of it, Captain.

601
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,007
You're out, by the way.

602
00:30:48,757 --> 00:30:50,693
Play ball!

603
00:30:56,007 --> 00:30:57,533
Was that slide at second legal?

604
00:30:57,644 --> 00:30:58,805
'Fraid so.

605
00:30:58,846 --> 00:31:00,315
Doesn't seem very sporting.

606
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,944
These guys are playing to win.

607
00:31:01,987 --> 00:31:03,684
Sporting doesn't enter into it.

608
00:31:19,792 --> 00:31:20,760
Safe!

609
00:31:25,838 --> 00:31:27,467
It's about time.

610
00:31:36,229 --> 00:31:37,197
Strike one.

611
00:31:37,231 --> 00:31:38,564
If it's not there, let it go.
All right!

612
00:31:38,601 --> 00:31:40,298
Don't reach for it.

613
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,007
Ball one.

614
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:43,009
Hey, now!

615
00:31:43,043 --> 00:31:44,033
Good eye, Worf!

616
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:45,012
Good eye!

617
00:31:49,691 --> 00:31:50,990
Ball two.

618
00:31:51,027 --> 00:31:52,963
Remember what we talked about.
Keep your eye on the ball.

619
00:32:00,415 --> 00:32:01,884
Foul ball. Strike two.

620
00:32:01,918 --> 00:32:02,886
Big stick!

621
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,910
Good eye, Worf.
Good eye.

622
00:32:12,541 --> 00:32:13,942
Ball three.

623
00:32:13,978 --> 00:32:15,037
Time.

624
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,379
Time!

625
00:32:19,457 --> 00:32:21,894
Let's go, batter.

626
00:32:23,131 --> 00:32:25,124
Do not rush me.

627
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:51,353
Strike three!

628
00:32:51,394 --> 00:32:52,623
What?! What are you
talking about?

629
00:32:52,662 --> 00:32:54,632
That ball was at least
a half a meter out!

630
00:32:54,667 --> 00:32:56,660
How can you call it a strike?

631
00:32:56,705 --> 00:32:58,538
Reverse the call!
Reverse the call!

632
00:32:58,575 --> 00:32:59,634
That was low and outside.

633
00:32:59,678 --> 00:33:00,907
The ball was clearly outside.

634
00:33:00,947 --> 00:33:02,610
Oh, what the hell
were you looking at?

635
00:33:02,718 --> 00:33:04,745
You can't tell me
that ball was over the plate.

636
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:06,225
What were you doing,
regenerating?

637
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,854
Caught the outside corner.

638
00:33:07,897 --> 00:33:09,058
Outside corner?!
Maybe the corner of the dugout!

639
00:33:09,099 --> 00:33:10,067
That was a ball and you know it!

640
00:33:10,101 --> 00:33:11,593
We should have two men on!

641
00:33:11,638 --> 00:33:13,005
Two men on! Two men on!

642
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:15,535
Gentlemen,
you are trying my patience.

643
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:18,278
You stole a run from us.

644
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:20,312
You stole it
just as if you reached up

645
00:33:20,357 --> 00:33:21,951
and tore it off
the scoreboard!

646
00:33:21,994 --> 00:33:23,121
You stole it from us!

647
00:33:23,163 --> 00:33:25,361
You... you're outta here!

648
00:33:25,402 --> 00:33:26,894
What?!

649
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:28,874
"No player shall at any time

650
00:33:28,909 --> 00:33:31,939
make contact with the
umpire in any manner."

651
00:33:31,982 --> 00:33:34,921
The prescribed penalty
for the violation is

652
00:33:34,956 --> 00:33:37,189
immediate ejection
from the game.

653
00:33:37,228 --> 00:33:40,531
Rule number 4.06, subsection
"A", paragraph four.

654
00:33:40,568 --> 00:33:43,039
Look it up,
but do it in the stands.

655
00:33:43,074 --> 00:33:46,070
You're gone!

656
00:34:07,127 --> 00:34:09,394
It was a ball.
That was no strike.

657
00:34:09,431 --> 00:34:11,094
I know it was a ball.

658
00:34:12,572 --> 00:34:13,699
Chief?

659
00:34:13,741 --> 00:34:14,709
What?

660
00:34:14,743 --> 00:34:16,269
I think that means
you're in charge now.

661
00:34:17,649 --> 00:34:18,742
You're right.

662
00:34:20,155 --> 00:34:22,216
Well, what are you
standing around for?

663
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,356
You never seen a man
thrown out of the game?

664
00:34:24,397 --> 00:34:25,730
Come on.
Get your gloves on

665
00:34:25,767 --> 00:34:26,894
and get in that field!

666
00:34:26,936 --> 00:34:28,097
Let's go! Come on!

667
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:29,631
Quark! Wake up!

668
00:34:29,676 --> 00:34:30,735
You're in right.

669
00:34:30,778 --> 00:34:32,304
Julian, you're on second.

670
00:34:32,349 --> 00:34:33,613
Leeta, you're in left.

671
00:34:33,651 --> 00:34:34,619
Come on.
Let's go, let's go.

672
00:34:34,654 --> 00:34:35,747
We got a game to play.

673
00:34:35,789 --> 00:34:37,053
Come on! Move it!

674
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,055
Play ball.

675
00:34:43,106 --> 00:34:44,598
Ball one.

676
00:34:51,491 --> 00:34:53,484
Strike one!

677
00:35:04,787 --> 00:35:07,224
Back, Ezri, back!
Go, go, go!

678
00:35:07,259 --> 00:35:08,660
All right!

679
00:35:09,764 --> 00:35:10,629
Yeah!

680
00:35:11,702 --> 00:35:13,467
Y-y-y-y-yes!

681
00:35:13,505 --> 00:35:16,136
Now that is a Fancy Dan.

682
00:35:16,178 --> 00:35:17,704
All right!

683
00:35:31,244 --> 00:35:33,305
Batter up!

684
00:35:51,623 --> 00:35:54,026
Home! Worf!
Bring it home!

685
00:36:06,422 --> 00:36:08,085
What's wrong?

686
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,600
He didn't touch home, Nog.

687
00:36:15,642 --> 00:36:16,941
Is that true?

688
00:36:18,815 --> 00:36:21,446
W-what do I do?!

689
00:36:21,488 --> 00:36:22,683
Find him and kill him!

690
00:36:22,724 --> 00:36:23,505
Just tag him out.

691
00:36:25,409 --> 00:36:26,638
Jake, cover home.

692
00:36:30,754 --> 00:36:32,451
Which one?

693
00:36:32,525 --> 00:36:33,686
Tag them all.

694
00:36:42,647 --> 00:36:45,551
Come on, Nog, hurry up.

695
00:36:47,658 --> 00:36:49,389
No. Tag the next one.

696
00:36:52,469 --> 00:36:53,459
Jake!

697
00:36:55,508 --> 00:36:56,635
He's out!

698
00:36:56,678 --> 00:36:57,407
You're out!

699
00:36:58,415 --> 00:37:00,282
Yeah, Nog, well done!

700
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:02,586
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

701
00:37:02,624 --> 00:37:04,891
He's out.

702
00:37:06,633 --> 00:37:07,726
Did you see that?

703
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:10,002
That's what I love
about this game.

704
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:11,738
You never know
what's going to happen next.

705
00:37:11,778 --> 00:37:13,145
Every situation is different,
huh?

706
00:37:13,181 --> 00:37:15,174
It looks like a lot of fun.

707
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:20,460
Rom... come here.

708
00:37:23,035 --> 00:37:25,131
Let's go.

709
00:37:26,977 --> 00:37:29,312
Where are we going?

710
00:37:36,031 --> 00:37:36,999
Safe!

711
00:37:41,577 --> 00:37:42,876
Do it, come on! Come on!

712
00:37:42,912 --> 00:37:44,039
Hey, come on, Jake!
You can do it!

713
00:37:44,082 --> 00:37:45,050
Come on!

714
00:37:45,084 --> 00:37:47,054
Chief! Chief! Chief!

715
00:37:47,088 --> 00:37:48,557
Call time out.

716
00:37:48,658 --> 00:37:49,717
Why?

717
00:37:49,761 --> 00:37:51,128
You're making a substitution.

718
00:37:51,164 --> 00:37:52,154
What?

719
00:37:59,415 --> 00:38:02,718
- Time!
- Time!

720
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:08,057
You're up, Rom.

721
00:38:08,101 --> 00:38:09,536
Oh, you've got to be kidding.

722
00:38:09,638 --> 00:38:11,631
We got man on third.
We could score.

723
00:38:11,676 --> 00:38:12,975
Sit down, Quark.

724
00:38:13,012 --> 00:38:14,173
Go ahead, Rom.

725
00:38:18,257 --> 00:38:20,250
You can do it.

726
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:31,349
All right, Dad!

727
00:38:31,385 --> 00:38:33,583
Come on, you can do it!

728
00:38:33,657 --> 00:38:34,852
Okay, go.
Let's play ball!

729
00:38:34,894 --> 00:38:36,193
Computer...

730
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,255
Come on, Rom.

731
00:38:37,298 --> 00:38:38,323
Go, Rom.

732
00:38:38,368 --> 00:38:39,860
Your attention, please.

733
00:38:39,905 --> 00:38:44,472
Now pinch-hitting for
Jake Sisko, number 13: Rom.

734
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:59,179
Come on, Dad!

735
00:38:59,214 --> 00:39:00,341
You can do it.

736
00:39:01,786 --> 00:39:03,187
I hope.

737
00:39:14,213 --> 00:39:15,580
Strike one.

738
00:39:17,386 --> 00:39:18,547
Come on, Dad.

739
00:39:20,995 --> 00:39:22,122
Come on, Rom.

740
00:39:22,164 --> 00:39:23,724
You can do it.
Come on, Rom.

741
00:39:33,356 --> 00:39:34,985
Strike two!

742
00:39:35,026 --> 00:39:37,463
It's okay, Rom.

743
00:39:39,268 --> 00:39:40,532
Julian.

744
00:39:43,544 --> 00:39:45,138
What was that thing called...

745
00:39:45,181 --> 00:39:48,518
you know, when you just
tap the ball down the baseline?

746
00:39:48,555 --> 00:39:49,888
Uh, bunt?

747
00:39:49,924 --> 00:39:51,484
That's it... a bunt.

748
00:39:51,528 --> 00:39:53,327
We've got to give him
the sign.

749
00:39:55,805 --> 00:39:57,104
Rom!

750
00:40:04,089 --> 00:40:05,956
What?

751
00:40:08,533 --> 00:40:09,398
What?

752
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,471
Go!

753
00:40:18,888 --> 00:40:22,055
Rom... run!

754
00:40:22,096 --> 00:40:27,096
Keep going, Rom!

755
00:40:40,736 --> 00:40:41,567
Safe!

756
00:40:44,979 --> 00:40:47,246
All right, Rom!

757
00:40:49,189 --> 00:40:51,490
All right, Rom!

758
00:40:53,097 --> 00:40:56,093
Rom! Rom! Rom!

759
00:41:02,284 --> 00:41:05,917
Umpire, this is
completely improper.

760
00:41:05,959 --> 00:41:08,487
The game is not over.

761
00:41:11,003 --> 00:41:12,336
You're gone!

762
00:41:18,687 --> 00:41:21,683
That was great, Dad!
A great bunt!

763
00:41:26,003 --> 00:41:27,973
Hey, Jake, that was
a hell of a game.

764
00:41:28,007 --> 00:41:29,374
A hell of a game.

765
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:31,004
I gave up ten runs.

766
00:41:31,047 --> 00:41:32,174
They're Vulcans.

767
00:41:32,216 --> 00:41:33,184
If they were humans

768
00:41:33,218 --> 00:41:35,519
you'd have held them
to just two or three.

769
00:41:35,557 --> 00:41:37,892
Well, when you
put it that way...

770
00:41:38,897 --> 00:41:40,092
Yes.

771
00:41:40,134 --> 00:41:42,367
Now, pardon me.

772
00:41:42,405 --> 00:41:44,638
I owe you an apology.

773
00:41:44,677 --> 00:41:48,173
No.
Unless you really want to.

774
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,959
I'm sorry.

775
00:41:55,668 --> 00:41:58,641
Apology accepted.

776
00:41:58,675 --> 00:42:00,976
If you have some time,
one day

777
00:42:01,013 --> 00:42:03,416
maybe you can teach me
how to bunt.

778
00:42:03,452 --> 00:42:05,582
Sure.

779
00:42:09,598 --> 00:42:11,329
What's a bunt?

780
00:42:11,369 --> 00:42:12,702
Oh.

781
00:42:14,409 --> 00:42:16,106
That's my dad.

782
00:42:16,146 --> 00:42:19,119
I fail to see why
you are celebrating.

783
00:42:19,152 --> 00:42:20,746
The Ferengi's bunt
was an accident

784
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:23,556
and you still lost the game.

785
00:42:23,596 --> 00:42:26,090
You are absolutely right

786
00:42:26,135 --> 00:42:27,627
and I couldn't be happier.

787
00:42:27,672 --> 00:42:30,508
Quark, a round of drinks
for the house

788
00:42:30,544 --> 00:42:31,843
on my tab.

789
00:42:31,881 --> 00:42:33,908
I'm way ahead of you, Captain.

790
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:36,854
You are attempting
to manufacture a triumph

791
00:42:36,892 --> 00:42:38,121
where none exists.

792
00:42:38,161 --> 00:42:39,926
I'd say he succeeded.

793
00:42:39,965 --> 00:42:41,662
To manufactured triumph.

794
00:42:41,702 --> 00:42:43,331
Manufactured triumph.
Hear, hear!

795
00:42:43,372 --> 00:42:44,636
Hear, hear!

796
00:42:44,675 --> 00:42:47,146
This is a typical human reaction

797
00:42:47,181 --> 00:42:49,584
based on emotionalism
and illogic.

798
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:53,391
Did I hear irritation
in that voice?

799
00:42:53,428 --> 00:42:55,364
Certainly not.

800
00:42:55,399 --> 00:42:58,566
That sounded positively
defensive to me.

801
00:42:58,606 --> 00:42:59,631
With a hint of anger.

802
00:42:59,675 --> 00:43:01,702
And just a touch of jealousy.

803
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:03,181
And a lot of bitterness.

804
00:43:03,216 --> 00:43:05,049
Are you always this emotional?

805
00:43:05,086 --> 00:43:07,649
I refuse to engage in this...

806
00:43:07,693 --> 00:43:09,926
human game of taunting.

807
00:43:09,964 --> 00:43:10,932
Human?

808
00:43:10,999 --> 00:43:12,901
Did I forget to wear
my spots today?

809
00:43:12,938 --> 00:43:13,906
All that intelligence

810
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,569
and he doesn't know
what a human looks like.

811
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:18,444
Captain...

812
00:43:18,483 --> 00:43:20,476
here's something else
for your desk.

813
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:26,297
Well...

814
00:43:26,334 --> 00:43:28,133
will you look at that?

815
00:43:29,808 --> 00:43:32,006
Would you like to sign it?

816
00:43:37,258 --> 00:43:38,317
No.

817
00:43:41,902 --> 00:43:44,032
Oh, my.

818
00:43:45,543 --> 00:43:46,005
Yes.
