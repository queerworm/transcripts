1
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:08,258
Kira to Sisko.
Go ahead, Colonel.

2
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:11,887
Captain Solok of
the Starship<i>  T'Kumbra</i>
is here to see you.

3
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,392
Send him in.

4
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:23,858
Welcome to Deep Space 9,
Captain.

5
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:25,943
Your welcome is acknowledged.

6
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:27,235
Have a seat.

7
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,867
It's been a long time.

8
00:00:32,867 --> 00:00:35,118
Ten years, two months,
five days.

9
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,871
You mean you don't know it
to the minute?

10
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:38,706
Of course I do,
but humans

11
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:41,208
are often irked
by such precision.

12
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:44,503
Especially the more
emotional humans.

13
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:47,297
Our repair list.

14
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,679
I understand
you were recently honored

15
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,431
with the Christopher Pike
Medal for Valor.

16
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,058
Congratulations.

17
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,768
Thank you.

18
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:02,396
And congratulations to you.

19
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,815
I heard you received your medal
last month.

20
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:07,818
My second, actually.

21
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:12,197
The<i> T'Kumbra</i> has been
in combat for over six months.

22
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:15,075
Spending time behind the lines
will be a welcome change.

23
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,118
This isn't exactly
a safe harbor.

24
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,996
We have seen
our share of action.

25
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:21,957
Of course you have.

26
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:28,171
We can upgrade
your inertial dampers
by the end of the day,

27
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,424
but to begin to overhaul
your warp core

28
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,009
will take at least a week.

29
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,345
Oh, that is most inefficient.

30
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,639
War is an inefficient business.

31
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:40,809
A somewhat
unprofessional attitude.

32
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:43,562
However, I've come to expect

33
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:45,814
a lack of professionalism
and efficiency

34
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,734
on starbases run by
human officers.

35
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:52,613
You're welcome to take your ship
to a Vulcan station.

36
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:55,699
I think there's
one about 50
light-years away.

37
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:57,785
But if you're planning
to stay here with us...

38
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:59,703
behind the lines,

39
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:02,289
then my Chief of Operations
will see to your requests.

40
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,041
Very well.

41
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,674
There is another matter
not listed on the formal report.

42
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:15,094
I need use of a holosuite.

43
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:17,721
The<i> T'Kumbra</i> holodecks
are currently under repair.

44
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:20,265
To arrange holosuite time,
you have to go through Quark.

45
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,768
He owns the only ones
on the station.

46
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,979
Then I will
speak to Quark.

47
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:28,315
I have created a special program
for my senior staff,

48
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,943
and they are quite eager
to resume using it.

49
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:33,070
Really?
Yes.

50
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:38,533
In fact,<i> you</i> may find
the program of some interest.

51
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:41,536
It is based on an Earth game.

52
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,455
And what game would that be?

53
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,424
Colonel, assemble
the senior staff
in the Wardroom<i> now.</i>

54
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,770
(<i> sighs</i> )

55
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,607
As you probably know,
the Starship<i> T'Kumbra</i>

56
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,234
is docked at our station.
What you may not know

57
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,529
is that their Captain
considers his crew--

58
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:19,783
an all Vulcan crew, by the way--
to be the finest in the fleet.

59
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:22,744
I happen to think that
the people sitting at this table

60
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,455
comprise the finest crew
in the Quadrant.

61
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,709
You're not going to get
much of an argument
from this group.

62
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,294
I didn't think so.
Which is why when their Captain

63
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:36,341
challenged us
to a contest of courage,
teamwork and sacrifice,

64
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,301
I accepted on your behalf.

65
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,845
We will destroy them.

66
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,930
I was hoping for that reaction.

67
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,265
So when is
this clash of the titans?

68
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,393
Two weeks in Holosuite 5.

69
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,602
What's the contest?

70
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:52,315
Baseball.

71
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:01,236
"Chapter 25:
The infield fly rule

72
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:02,988
"is invoked in instances where

73
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:04,823
"with both first base
and second base occupied

74
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,700
"or with first, second
and third base occupied--

75
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,367
What if there is
a runner at home?

76
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,870
There's never a runner at home.

77
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,914
Okay, uh... "and
fewer than two outs

78
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,167
the batter hits a high fly..."

79
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:25,510
"Fly: The term
for a batted ball
while it is in the air."

80
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:29,181
Oh, right.
Uh, uh, "fewer than two outs
the batter hits a high fly...

81
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,390
"which in the judgment
of the umpire

82
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,268
"can readily be caught
by an infielder

83
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,312
"or the pitcher or catcher
inside fair ground.

84
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,356
"The batter is then called out

85
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:39,900
regardless of whether the ball
is subsequently caught or not."

86
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,318
That seems simple enough.

87
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,362
"An attempt to bunt,

88
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:46,447
"however, under the
conditions noted above,

89
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,075
"which results in a fair fly,

90
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:51,245
shall not be regarded
an infield fly."

91
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,163
What's a bunt?

92
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,498
A bunt: A ball that has
been deliberately tapped

93
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,709
into the area between
the pitcher and the catcher

94
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,295
by the batter in order to force
the fielding side

95
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,964
to throw out the batter
and allow a runner to advance.

96
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,592
Right. Chief,
what's a grand slam?

97
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,888
Uh... a home run
that's hit

98
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,390
when the bases
are crowded.

99
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,725
Right,
except it's "bases loaded."

100
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,603
Now...
what's a "Fancy Dan"?

101
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,273
You're making that up.
I most certainly am not.

102
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:26,154
Hi. Jake told us
about the game
against the Vulcans.

103
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:30,117
It sounds really exciting.
You should come watch.

104
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:33,078
"Fancy Dan: a fielder
who puts an extra flourish

105
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:35,414
"on his movements
while making a play

106
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:38,208
in hopes of gaining the approval
of the spectators."

107
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,710
Actually, we were
thinking of doing
more than watching.

108
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,587
If we can.

109
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:46,591
That is, if there's
still room for other
potential players

110
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,509
to possibly try and--

111
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,845
We want to try out.

112
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,765
Nog always talks about
how Captain Sisko
and Jake play baseball

113
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,642
and how it brings them
closer together.

114
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,727
Since Nog and I
haven't seen much
of each other lately,

115
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,520
I thought this might
be a good way

116
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,315
of spending some
time together.

117
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,984
And I decided to make it
a complete family outing.

118
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,194
That is so sweet.
Isn't it?

119
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,946
QUARK:
Idiotic is
what it is.

120
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,490
You're going to make
a fool out of yourself.

121
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,242
I will not.

122
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,619
You can barely spin
a dabo wheel,

123
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,496
much less kick a ball
around a field.

124
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,332
Shows how much you know.

125
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:21,960
You don't kick the ball...
do you?

126
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,463
You won't make the team.

127
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:26,673
At least we're trying out.
What about you?

128
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:31,511
I don't have the slightest
interest in this hu-man game.

129
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:35,515
You know why?
Jake says it's a game
that takes heart,

130
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,809
and you sold yours
a long time ago.

131
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,019
Come on, Rom.

132
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,108
What time are tryouts?

133
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,361
1300, Holosuite 4.

134
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,038
SISKO:
Hey, hey!

135
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,539
All right!

136
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,249
Ha, ha, whoo!

137
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,002
Yes!

138
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:07,797
First day of practice,
and it's an exciting time!
Am I right?

139
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,549
ALL:
Oh, yeah.

140
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,510
Yeah! There we go.
There we go.
That's the spirit!

141
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,636
Now, first let me introduce
you to our pitcher

142
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:17,724
and our secret weapon,
Jake "The Slider" Sisko!

143
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,434
Good luck, Jake.
The Slider.

144
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:22,229
Now, all the other
positions

145
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,855
are still open
for tryouts.

146
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,648
Now, every one
of you here today

147
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,193
has seen at least
one baseball game

148
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:29,694
with me in
the holosuite.

149
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,113
Now, I know
it looks simple--

150
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:35,200
you throw the ball,
you catch the ball,
you hit the ball--

151
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,244
<i>but</i> it is
not that easy.

152
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,037
It's a difficult game.

153
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,955
It was a difficult
game to play

154
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,582
even for seasoned
professionals

155
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,876
who spent their
lifetime practicing.

156
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:48,088
And now we have
less than two weeks
to build a team

157
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,298
and to face
the opponent.

158
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:53,634
Now, I know
what some of you
are thinking.

159
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:56,179
"How are we
going to beat
the Logicians?

160
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:59,307
"They're all Vulcans.
They're stronger
and faster

161
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:02,143
than any one of us..."
Except for Worf.

162
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:05,313
And our genetically
enhanced doctor.

163
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:09,526
But there is more to baseball
than physical strength.

164
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:10,818
It's, uh...

165
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:15,532
it's about courage...

166
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,535
and it's also about faith,

167
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:23,331
and it is also
about heart.

168
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:28,545
And if there's one thing
our Vulcan friends lack,
it's heart.

169
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:31,756
I think we
can beat them.

170
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:35,510
I know we
can beat them.
Yep.

171
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,429
We<i> are</i> going
to beat them!

172
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:39,055
Am I right?
ALL:
Yeah!

173
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,557
I can't hear you.

174
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,476
ALL:
Yes, sir!

175
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:45,479
Are we going
to beat the Vulcans?
I can't hear you!

176
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,105
ALL:
Yes, sir!

177
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:48,898
All right, then. Let's
play some baseball!

178
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,817
First, I want you
to pair off.

179
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,653
Spread yourselves
about ten meters apart

180
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,738
and, uh, play some catch.

181
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,199
Have fun.

182
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:01,453
Yeah. Just a little, uh,
throw and catch.

183
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:02,954
Nice and easy.

184
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:06,291
(<i> grunts</i> )

185
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,750
EZRI:
You almost had it.

186
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,839
WORF:
I said, throw it here.

187
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:20,180
BASHIR:
Don't throw it to her.

188
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,390
You've got to throw it
to someone who's
looking at you.

189
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,479
Oh, come on, Quark.

190
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:35,736
This is going to be
two long, hard weeks.

191
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:39,115
Jake, I don't care
how hard and long

192
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,201
these two weeks are,

193
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,662
but I'm not going
to lose to Solok

194
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,746
in a baseball game.

195
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,624
We are going to win.

196
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:53,796
Umpire?

197
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,714
That's right.
Will you do it?

198
00:11:55,714 --> 00:12:00,554
Well, wouldn't
a holographic umpire
be more accurate?

199
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:03,473
I don't want
a computer program
calling a baseball game.

200
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,266
That's something Solok
would do.

201
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,852
I want a real person
behind the plate,

202
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,980
not just some collection
of photons and magnetic fields.

203
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,568
I-I-I also want a person who
can be completely impartial,

204
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:17,654
and I can't think
of anyone I trust more.

205
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,322
Well, that's, uh...

206
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,115
that's very flattering.

207
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,076
Oh, it's the truth.
Will you do it?

208
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,662
(<i> sighs</i> )

209
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,914
All right.
Outstanding.

210
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:30,375
Here are the rules.
Uh, if you have
any questions,

211
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,294
I'll be with the team
in the Infirmary.
The Infirmary?

212
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,631
Ah, we had a few problems
at practice today.

213
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:39,092
Remember, the game is
in less than two weeks.

214
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,928
So you better start
to, uh, work on your moves.

215
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,849
My moves?

216
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,352
I can't believe this.
I used to be an athlete.

217
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,312
At least, I remember
being an athlete.

218
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,898
My third host, Emony,
was an Olympic gymnast.

219
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,693
I keep expecting my legs
to react like hers did,

220
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,653
but I fell
all over myself.

221
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,614
It's like I don't know
my own body anymore.

222
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:03,032
QUARK:
I don't know what
you're complaining about.

223
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:07,621
At least you didn't
require major surgery.

224
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:11,040
Knitting together
a couple of bones is not
major surgery, Quark.

225
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,753
It is if the bones
are in the back
of your skull.

226
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,507
I hope you learned
your lesson.

227
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,427
Always look behind you
before swinging a bat.

228
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,429
SISKO: So, how are
my casualties doing?

229
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,473
We'll live.
If you believe Julian.

230
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,057
Personally, I'm not sure
I'm going to make it.

231
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,517
That's the
spirit, old man.

232
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,144
Don't lose your
sense of humor.

233
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:35,231
Hey, Chief,
how's the shoulder?

234
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,942
He's out, I'm afraid.
His rotator cuff
was badly torn.

235
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,194
Can't you repair
the damage?
I need him on third,

236
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,363
<i>and</i> he's anchoring
the second half of the lineup.

237
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,658
I've repaired
the rotator cuff,
but the ligaments

238
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:46,825
need time to knit together
with the clavicular joint.

239
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,286
I can't let him play baseball.

240
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,997
Damn!
O'BRIEN:
I'm sorry, sir.

241
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,624
I was really looking
forward to the game.

242
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:54,668
Well, there's an old saying--

243
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,919
"those who can't... coach."

244
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:00,173
As for now, you are batting,
pitching and first base coach.

245
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,676
Oh, great.

246
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,719
Which one
is first base?

247
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,763
We'll go over that again later.

248
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,265
All right. Practice
tomorrow morning

249
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:12,059
at 0730.
Don't be late.

250
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,646
We'll be there.
Well, if you'll excuse me,

251
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:16,690
I still have to realign
Worf's zygomatic bone.

252
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,191
Ow.

253
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,402
Tell him I'm sorry.

254
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,072
Ah, we can move Ezri
over to third.

255
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,616
No, no, no,
I need her in center.

256
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,451
Ooh! I know
who we can get.

257
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:30,328
I'll have to pull some strings,
but I think I can do it.

258
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:31,371
Who?

259
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:44,175
Welcome home.

260
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,469
Oh, music to my ears.

261
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,306
Mmm. Does this mean
you missed me?

262
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,851
Like a piece of my
heart was missing.

263
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:57,522
Oh, sweet words.
And flowers, too?

264
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:59,232
Are you feeling all right?

265
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,568
Now that you're back,
I feel outstanding.

266
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,820
Oh, I could get used to this.

267
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,739
And well you should-- are
you going to be here long?

268
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,657
Um, as a matter of fact,

269
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,868
my next three cargo runs
have been reassigned.

270
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:11,703
Really?
Oh, bureaucrats--

271
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:13,413
who knows why
they do anything?

272
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,831
Who knows?

273
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:17,041
So...

274
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,878
what are we going to do
with all my time off?

275
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:21,421
I have a few ideas.

276
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:22,756
I bet you do.

277
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,215
So tell me,

278
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,175
how's your throwing
arm holding up?

279
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:35,935
There you go, Kas!
That's what I'm talking about.

280
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,145
All right.
Head's up, people.

281
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,981
There's a runner on first,
one away.

282
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,820
I got it!

283
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,114
I got it! I got it!

284
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,367
Oh!

285
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,952
How many is that?

286
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,328
Today?

287
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,497
I think he's missed ten.

288
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,635
(<i> grunting</i> )

289
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,971
Damn.

290
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:19,437
All right. Batting practice.

291
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,072
What's he doing here?

292
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,658
He's scouting us.

293
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:36,913
If he is taking the time
to conduct reconnaissance,

294
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,623
he must be worried.

295
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,458
He should be.
Next week on this field,

296
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,835
that man is
going to get

297
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,795
a painful lesson
in humility.

298
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,051
Batter up.

299
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,854
Today, I'm going
to hit the ball.

300
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,814
You just watch.

301
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,865
Oh!

302
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,746
All right, Rom,
remember what we talked about.

303
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,247
Keep your eye on the ball.

304
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,583
Follow the ball
from the pitcher's hands

305
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,460
all the way
to the bat.

306
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:34,762
Oh!

307
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,893
Sorry.

308
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,227
You can do it.

309
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,770
Hang in there, Rom.

310
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,022
All right, Rom.

311
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,280
Oh-oh.

312
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,949
Sorry.

313
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,787
That's it.
You're done.

314
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,622
I'll do better
tomorrow, Captain.

315
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:04,667
No, you won't.
You are finished.
Gone. Off the team.

316
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,210
Sir, can't you give him
another chance--

317
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,837
Is anyone talking
to you, Ensign?

318
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,422
I can't play?

319
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,049
That's the smartest
thing you said all week.

320
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:12,926
You can't play.
Now, get your gear.

321
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,428
Get out of here.
Worf, you're up.

322
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,402
Captain Sisko hates me.

323
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:32,904
He doesn't
hate you, Rom.

324
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:34,989
Sisko was just
blowing off steam.

325
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,199
He'll get over it.
That's right.

326
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,577
I'll go talk
with him in the morning.
Maybe he'll change his--

327
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:42,162
No! I don't want
him to kick you
off the team, too.

328
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,790
I don't care
about the team.

329
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,792
If you can't play,
I won't, either.

330
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,752
Oh, that goes
for me, too.
And me.

331
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:49,587
O'BRIEN:
And us.

332
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:51,464
Benjamin was way
out of line today, Rom.

333
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,091
Yeah. This game is
supposed to be fun,

334
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:55,134
not a life-and-
death struggle.

335
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,845
So we've decided to quit
unless he reinstates
you immediately.

336
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:01,181
No! Please!
Rom, we're on
your side.

337
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,768
I don't want to make
the team like this.

338
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:05,561
I had my chance, but
I wasn't good enough.

339
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,814
Let's face it--
the Captain's right.

340
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,941
I'm hopeless.
I don't deserve
to be on the team.

341
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:12,234
You play.
You've earned it.

342
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,070
Playing baseball doesn't
mean anything to me.

343
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,863
But it should.
You're good at it.

344
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,198
So are you, and I
want to see you play.

345
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,200
I want to see
all of you play.

346
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,788
I want to see<i> our</i>
team beat the Vulcans,

347
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:27,041
even if I'm only watching
from the... the, uh...

348
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,335
The stands.
Right.

349
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,711
Please?

350
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,714
If, uh...

351
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,716
that's the way
you feel about it.

352
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,637
Rom, there are moments

353
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:42,556
when I know exactly
why I married you.

354
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:48,312
What are you eating?
I'm not eating.
I'm chewing.

355
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,438
Chewing what?

356
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,024
Gum. It's traditional.

357
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,525
I had the replicator
create me some.

358
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:53,943
They just chewed it?

359
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,903
No, they infused
the gum with flavor.

360
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,613
What did you infuse it with?

361
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,239
Scotch.

362
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,617
Here. Try some.

363
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,288
Hmm.

364
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,581
(<i> chuckles</i> )

365
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,044
All right.
You got a runner on first.

366
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:13,129
You got a runner on second.
One away.

367
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:15,798
Ground ball
to the second baseman.
Kira, what do you do?

368
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,466
I go for the
double play,

369
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,052
unless the runner
on third is already

370
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:20,678
on his way home,
in which case--

371
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:22,346
KASIDY:
Okay, relax,

372
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,306
and keep your weight
on the balls of your feet.

373
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,266
Back elbow up.

374
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,811
Yeah. Good.

375
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:30,188
Yeah.

376
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,733
Faster.
Come on, come on.

377
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,069
Faster. Come on,
come on...

378
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,277
Come on! Come on!

379
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:39,613
Faster!
Ooh, yeah! Good!

380
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:40,698
I got it!
Mine!

381
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:42,491
I got it!

382
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,118
Well, don't
look at me!

383
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:45,661
You called it!
I was out of position!

384
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,163
That was yours all the way!

385
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,706
(<i> groaning</i> )
Oh, come on, Julian.

386
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,626
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

387
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,094
Safe!

388
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,222
Safe!

389
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:06,974
Safe!

390
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,729
You're out!

391
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:14,565
You're out!

392
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,445
Oh, that's quite a knot.

393
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,864
(<i> grunting and groaning</i> )

394
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,617
Your back is like a minefield
of bruised muscles.

395
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:28,037
You tell me something
I don't know. Ow!

396
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,747
Okay.

397
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:32,625
You're lifting
your foot up
at the plate.

398
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,293
<i>What?</i>

399
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,795
Okay. Take a swing.

400
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,549
(<i> sighs</i> )

401
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:56,440
Wait. Stop.
Right there. Look.

402
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,525
You're lifting your foot
in the backswing.

403
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,611
It's been messing up
your whole rhythm.

404
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:02,905
Not<i> that</i> bad.

405
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,242
I know that look.

406
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,244
It's the I'd-really-
like-to-smash-something-

407
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:10,329
but-she'll-think-
I'm-crazy look.

408
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,207
Well, don't let me stop you.
They're<i> your</i> quarters.

409
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:15,793
Smash away,
if it'll make you feel better.

410
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:18,838
The only way
I'll feel better
is to beat Solok tomorrow.

411
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:22,382
So, do I get to hear
the Solok story now?

412
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:24,885
And before you say no,
you'd better consider the fact

413
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:27,596
that if you don't tell me,
you won't have a third baseman.

414
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,723
(<i> sighs</i> )

415
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:35,395
We were in the same class
at the Academy, you know.

416
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:37,523
One weekend I was
with some friends

417
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:40,651
at an off-campus bar--
the Launching Pad--

418
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:44,113
and Solok came in
with some Vulcan Cadets

419
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:46,532
who said
they were doing research

420
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:50,119
on illogical
human bonding rituals.

421
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,163
We didn't take kindly to that.

422
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:54,040
And you'd... had a few drinks.

423
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,084
Yeah... one or two.

424
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,962
Well, we got into a debate,
and Solok said

425
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:03,924
that Vulcans were
naturally superior to humans

426
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:07,553
and other "emotionally
handicapped" species.

427
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,972
Of course, I took
the opposite position.

428
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:13,600
So... there I am...

429
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,147
drunk... and debating
logic versus emotion

430
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:22,360
with a smug...
and very sober Vulcan.

431
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:26,364
Well, to make
a long story short, I decided
that the best way to prove

432
00:23:26,364 --> 00:23:29,367
that humans were every bit
the equal of Vulcans

433
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:32,078
was to challenge him
to a wrestling match.

434
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:34,247
Wrestling?
All I wanted to do

435
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:36,207
was to wipe that arrogant look
off his face,

436
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:40,044
so in the heat of the moment...
I challenged him.

437
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:41,921
And?

438
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:46,217
I, uh... ended up
in the Infirmary...

439
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:50,304
with a separated shoulder,
two cracked ribs

440
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:52,932
and a very bruised ego.

441
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,808
(<i> laughing</i> ):
Oh, Ben...

442
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:57,353
I don't... no,
I don't mean to laugh,

443
00:23:57,353 --> 00:24:00,273
but... what did you expect?

444
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:04,568
A Vulcan has three times
the strength of a human.

445
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:07,196
(<i> whistles</i> )
And they're faster, too.

446
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:10,908
But you're right.
I got what I deserved.

447
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,994
<i>And</i> if it had ended
right there,

448
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,122
it would've been fine,
but it didn't.

449
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:19,750
Solok took every opportunity
to remind me of our match.

450
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,211
He used to point me out whenever
I walked across the campus.

451
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:25,965
In fact, he wrote
five psychology papers
about our match.

452
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,134
I became the living embodiment

453
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:31,387
of why Vulcans were
inherently superior to humans.

454
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:33,764
You don't mean he was gloating?
A Vulcan?

455
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:35,224
That's exactly
what I mean.

456
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:36,725
He may have hidden it

457
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,311
beneath that Vulcan calm,

458
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:41,855
but... he loved
every minute of it.

459
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,485
And you'd think
that once we graduated

460
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:49,487
it would've stopped,
but it didn't.

461
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:52,950
Over the years,
Solok wrote over a dozen papers

462
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,828
on Vulcan/human
comparative profiles...

463
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:58,998
and in the beginning
of every paper...

464
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:01,834
is an analysis of that...

465
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:04,086
damned wrestling match.

466
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:07,214
And now he comes to your station
and announces

467
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:09,507
that he's put together
a baseball team.

468
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:11,469
He doesn't care about baseball.

469
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:14,138
All he wants to do is to rub
my nose in it one more time,

470
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:17,057
but now he is using my game.
<i>My game!</i>

471
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,310
You should tell that
to the Niners.

472
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,979
They don't understand
why you're so caught up in this.

473
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:24,106
Oh, no, I'd rather they think

474
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:26,608
I'm just caught up
in some baseball game

475
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:30,988
than pursuing...
an adolescent rivalry.

476
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:33,949
Just tell them the truth.
They'll understand.

477
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:36,702
They need to know how personal
this is to you.

478
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,371
Oh, no.

479
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:39,579
(<i> exasperated sigh</i> )

480
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:43,541
No.

481
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:45,627
I mean it.

482
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,297
And you can't tell
them, either.

483
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:55,888
I want you
to promise me.

484
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:03,145
All right. I promise.

485
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:06,148
He made me promise
not to tell you, so you'll have
to keep this under your hats.

486
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:09,193
Curzon and Jadzia
always wondered why
Benjamin hated Solok,

487
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:10,861
but he'd never
talk about it.

488
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:12,363
Well, he's embarrassed.

489
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:14,781
He's calling it
an "adolescent rivalry"

490
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:17,451
but Solok's the one
that's kept this thing going.

491
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:19,412
And now he's trying
to beat the Captain
at his own game.

492
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:21,830
It is a
dishonorable motive.

493
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,623
I'm beginning to
hate him myself.

494
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:26,043
So, what are we going
to do about it?

495
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:28,921
I tell you what we do.
We go out there tomorrow

496
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,756
and we put that Vulcan
in his place.

497
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:32,632
We win it for the Captain.

498
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:35,428
And for all
our "emotionally
handicapped" races.

499
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:38,305
Now, there's something
worth fighting for, right?

500
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:46,772
Niners!

501
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,315
ALL:
Niners!

502
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:49,649
(<i> laughter and hooting</i> )

503
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:57,408
(<i> anthem playing</i> )

504
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:44,662
(<i> applause</i> )

505
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:46,624
(<i> cheers and whistles</i> )

506
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:04,016
O'BRIEN:
Okay, laddies, let's go.

507
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:06,768
Let's go. Come on.
Let's show these guys.

508
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:15,819
Look, let's, uh, dispense
with the crowd.

509
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:19,406
My team has never played
in front of people before.

510
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,783
If you wish.

511
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:25,371
Computer, eliminate
the spectators.

512
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:27,705
Play ball!

513
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,795
Batter up!

514
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:41,761
All right, Niners,
Let's hear some chatter.

515
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:43,930
Hey, batter, batter,
batter, batter, batter!

516
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,141
Hey, batter, batter, batter,
batter, batter, batter, batter!

517
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,934
Death to the opposition.

518
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,353
SISKO:

to charge the ball.

They rattled you.
Yeah. They're pretty good.

That ball was at least

Caught the outside corner.

00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:42,899
Safe!
(<i> all cheering</i> )

700
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:47,404
All right, Rom!

701
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:51,657
All right, Rom!

702
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:56,162
(<i> all chanting</i> ):
Rom! Rom! Rom!

703
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:06,131
Umpire, this is
completely improper.

704
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:08,716
The game is not over.

705
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:12,470
You're gone!

706
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:20,979
That was great, Dad!
A great bunt!

707
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:28,153
Hey, Jake, that was
a hell of a game.

708
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:29,570
A hell of a game.

709
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,739
I gave up ten runs.
They're Vulcans.

710
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:35,785
If they were humans,
you'd have held them
to just two or three.

711
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:38,997
Well, when you
put it that way...

712
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,248
Yes.

713
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:42,583
Now, pardon me.

714
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,710
I owe you an apology.

715
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:48,256
No.
Unless you really want to.

716
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:54,012
I'm sorry.

717
00:41:55,472 --> 00:41:57,765
Apology accepted.

718
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:00,977
If you have some time,
one day,

719
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:03,480
maybe you can teach me
how to bunt.

720
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,648
Sure.

721
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:11,363
What's a bunt?

722
00:42:11,363 --> 00:42:12,905
Oh.

723
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,117
That's my dad.

724
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:19,162
I fail to see why
you are celebrating.

725
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:21,414
The Ferengi's bunt
was an accident

726
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:23,875
and you still
lost the game.

727
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:26,002
You are absolutely right,

728
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:27,586
and I couldn't
be happier.

729
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:30,382
Quark, a round of drinks
for the house

730
00:42:30,382 --> 00:42:31,799
on my tab.

731
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,885
I'm way ahead of you, Captain.

732
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:36,554
You are attempting to
manufacture a triumph

733
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,056
where none exists.

734
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:39,974
I'd say he succeeded.

735
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,559
To manufactured triumph.

736
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,228
Manufactured triumph.
Hear, hear!

737
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:44,687
ALL:
Hear, hear!

738
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,814
This is a typical
human reaction

739
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:49,608
based on emotionalism
and illogic.

740
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:51,152
(<i> theatrical gasp</i> )

741
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:53,571
Did I hear irritation
in that voice?

742
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,240
Certainly not.

743
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,451
That sounded positively
defensive to me.

744
00:42:58,451 --> 00:42:59,869
With a hint
of anger.

745
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:01,746
And just a touch
of jealousy.

746
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:03,122
And a lot of bitterness.

747
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:04,916
Are you always
this emotional?

748
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:07,793
I refuse to
engage in this...

749
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,879
<i>human</i> game
of taunting.

750
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:12,631
Human?
Did I forget to wear
my spots today?

751
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:15,301
All that intelligence,
and he doesn't know
what a human looks like.

752
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:16,594
(<i> all laughing</i> )

753
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,263
KIRA:
Captain...

754
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:20,515
here's something else
for your desk.

755
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:26,521
Well...

756
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:28,106
will you look at that?

757
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:31,984
Would you like to sign it?

758
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:34,404
(<i> all laughing</i> )

759
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:38,533
No.

760
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:40,743
(<i> all laughing louder</i> )

761
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:43,829
Oh, my.

762
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:46,749
Yes.
