1
00:00:01,751 --> 00:00:02,711
( computer beeps )

2
00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:04,254
COMPUTER:<i> The time is 0500.</i>

3
00:00:04,462 --> 00:00:05,755
Mmm... yeah, all right...

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,094
Julian?

5
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:12,262
Yes.

6
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:14,264
We have to get up.

7
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:15,807
Yeah, sure.

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,309
It's a big day.

9
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:19,728
( satisfied sigh )

10
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:21,438
It was a big night.

11
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:22,564
( laughs softly )

12
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,987
Cleared up a lot of unanswered questions.

13
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:31,364
Such as?

14
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:35,744
Such as just how far
these spots really go down.

15
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,581
I suppose you'll want to tell Miles.

16
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:41,541
Now why would I want to do that?

17
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,710
Because you tell him everything.

18
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:45,420
True.

19
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,380
But you know what?

20
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,007
In this case...

21
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,761
I'm going to make an exception.

22
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,137
Good.

23
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,890
( sighs )

24
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:59,100
Mmm... we really should get up.

25
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,102
We don't want the <i>Defiant</i>
leaving without us.

26
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,856
You know, I've never been into battle
with someone I've slept with before.

27
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:08,401
Well, there's a first time for everything.

28
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,945
Now that we're finally together

29
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,616
it'd be such a shame
if something happened to one of us.

30
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,411
Let's make a pact.

31
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,622
We both come home alive.

32
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:22,415
You got yourself a deal.

33
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,002
I'm holding you to that.

34
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,429
Oh, and don't forget,
Kirayoshi has his checkup

35
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:37,347
at 0900 tomorrow.

36
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,349
I've already confirmed
the appointment with Nurse Bandee.

37
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,350
Come on, sweetie, one more bite.

38
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,519
And don't stay up all night
writing that paper on...

39
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:43,520
W--what are those trees called?

40
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:46,481
Arfillian Ficus.
And they're not trees, they're shrubs.

41
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:49,400
Yeah, well... try to get some sleep.
Oh, and--

42
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,986
Honey... we'll be fine. Stop worrying.

43
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,154
Right.

44
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,156
Molly...

45
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,534
please don't touch that.

46
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:59,994
I let you play with my toys.

47
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,288
Yeah, but, see, this isn't a toy.

48
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,791
This is a... model.

49
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,584
Maybe it belongs in a museum then.

50
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,841
I suppose I could give it to Julian.

51
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,801
Sounds good to me.

52
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,429
Speaking of Julian have you told him
about Starfleet's offer yet?

53
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:20,932
Uh... no, not yet.

54
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:22,684
I knew it.

55
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,394
What's that supposed to mean?

56
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,062
We're not going back to Earth.

57
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,564
Of course we are.

58
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:31,609
Daddy's going to teach at the Academy...
when the war's over.

59
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,987
Then why haven't you told Julian?

60
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,823
"Out of the mouth of babes."

61
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:42,078
I'll tell him, you know... when...
I think he's ready to hear it.

62
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:44,873
How's that?

63
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:50,253
Oh, it's doing wonders for my head
but it's my stomach that's bothering me.

64
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,507
If it will help, morning sickness ends
after the first trimester.

65
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:57,427
Oh, that's two more months.
I don't think I'm going to make it.

66
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,636
You're going to make it.

67
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:01,472
-Ben?
-Hmm?

68
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,351
Promise me something.

69
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,689
Promise that you'll come home to us.

70
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,025
I promise.

71
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:15,361
I don't believe it.

72
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,822
I said I promise.

73
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,198
No, it's not...

74
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,534
( groaning )

75
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,161
( door chimes )

76
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,162
Come in.

77
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,208
Hey, I thought I'd walk you
to the <i>Defiant.</i>

78
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:30,919
I'd like that.

79
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:33,796
Ah.

80
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,048
How's Kas?

81
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,382
( coughing and retching )

82
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,762
Reports of my death
have been exaggerated...

83
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,223
but not by much.

84
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,682
( groaning )

85
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,894
Isn't there something
she can take to make her feel better?

86
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:52,190
She doesn't like taking medication
unless it's absolutely necessary.

87
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,149
( groaning )

88
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,525
Sounds necessary to me.

89
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,695
Waiting for you to leave
only makes me feel worse.

90
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,864
If you're going to go, just go.

91
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,162
Are you sure I can't get you anything?

92
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,999
Just hurry up and come back home.

93
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:13,711
( groaning )

94
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,882
Mind if I walk with you, Commander?

95
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:18,800
Not at all.

96
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,387
Captain Sisko informed me that you would
be joining us on the mission.

97
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:27,100
I hope that when we reach Cardassia
we find Colonel Kira alive and well.

98
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:30,270
So do I, Commander. So do I.

99
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,443
NOG: Captain on the Bridge.

100
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,363
All right, people.

101
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,699
What do you say we end this war?

102
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,200
Sounds good to me.

103
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,869
Ensign, I believe you know
the way to Cardassia.

104
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,706
If I get lost, I'll just
follow the ship in front of us.

105
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,295
{\an8}WEYOUN: The Federation invasion fleet
has left Deep Space 9.

106
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,882
{\an8}They'll reach the Cardassian
border by tomorrow night.

107
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:06,759
{\an8}( electronically distorted voice )

108
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:12,306
{\an8}Our brave Jem'Hadar soldiers
have a motto,"Victory is life."

109
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,851
{\an8}( distorted voice )

110
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,061
{\an8}I'm glad you're familiar with it,

111
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:20,606
{\an8}because today those words
have meaning for us all.

112
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,569
{\an8}The outcome of this battle will determine
the outcome of the war.

113
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,365
{\an8}Either we destroy their invasion forces
or they destroy us.

114
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,825
{\an8}There is no other option.

115
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,494
{\an8}( distorted voice )

116
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,246
{\an8}Fight well today...

117
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:39,292
{\an8}and Romulus will be yours
to do with as you wish.

118
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,335
{\an8}( distorted voice )

119
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:44,714
{\an8}Yes, yes. And Earth, too.

120
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,217
{\an8}( distorted voice )

121
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:52,096
{\an8}I assure you... the pleasure is all mine.

122
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,681
{\an8}( distorted voice )

123
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,523
{\an8}Is something bothering you?

124
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:09,697
{\an8}Apparently, uh...
I was under the mistaken impression

125
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:13,784
{\an8}that all Federation territories
would fall under my jurisdiction...

126
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,411
{\an8}including Earth.

127
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,538
{\an8}And so they shall.

128
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:19,665
{\an8}But...

129
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,543
{\an8}you promised the Breen.

130
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:26,255
{\an8}I would promise the Breen
the entire Alpha Quadrant

131
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,591
{\an8}if I thought it would help win this war.

132
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:35,640
{\an8}The Founder is wise in all things.

133
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:36,682
{\an8}( door opening )

134
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:44,732
{\an8}Founder, I've heard a disturbing rumor
about the traitor Damar.

135
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,150
{\an8}What about him?

136
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:47,944
{\an8}He may be alive.

137
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,488
{\an8}Is this possible?

138
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,908
{\an8}I don't see how.
We destroyed his ship, his rebel bases...

139
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,826
{\an8}But his body was never found.

140
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:01,082
{\an8}They say he's here... on Cardassia Prime.
In the capital, no less.

141
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,667
{\an8}Look into this matter.

142
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:08,839
{\an8}-If Damar is alive...
-He won't be for long.

143
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:28,317
{\an8}JEM HADAR SOLDIER: Halt!

144
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,487
{\an8}Step forward... slowly.

145
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,364
{\an8}I'm sorry, have we done something wrong?

146
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,741
{\an8}We're new to the city
and I'm afraid we're lost.

147
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:36,659
{\an8}Quiet!

148
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,704
{\an8}You are Legate Damar.

149
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:43,165
{\an8}I told you-- you look just like him.
I can't tell you how many times

150
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,084
my cousin
has been mistaken for that traitor.

151
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:49,463
He will be taken to Dominion headquarters.
You will die here.

152
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,049
( distorted voice )

153
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,510
I do not understand you.

154
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:56,679
( groaning )

155
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:05,646
I don't mean to sound ungrateful, but...
what are you doing here?

156
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,023
Watching your backs.

157
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:10,443
I thought we decided it would be safer
if you stayed out of sight.

158
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,446
Well, that's what the helmet's for.
You should be wearing one, too.

159
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,824
Every Jem'Hadar and Breen soldier
on Cardassia's looking for you.

160
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,869
If I'm to lead this revolt
I can't do it hiding in a cellar.

161
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,288
It was necessary for me
to attend that gathering tonight.

162
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:27,752
Well, fill me in later.
If anyone stops us, you're my prisoners.

163
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:35,051
But the vote was unanimous.
The work disruptions begin tomorrow.

164
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,720
Power, communication
and transportation facilities

165
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,347
throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged.

166
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,891
The Dominion fleet will be cut off
from all ground support.

167
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,560
That way, they'll have to face
the invasion force on their own.

168
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,228
And once the Dominion is crushed...

169
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:50,900
MILA: All Cardassia will be free again.
Oh, when you were a small boy

170
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:55,321
I was worried about you.
Always getting into trouble.

171
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:59,575
So secretive, so full of deceit.

172
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:03,245
Who would've thought
those disgraceful characteristics

173
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,915
would be turned to virtues.

174
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,669
-More tea?
-You're too kind.

175
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,014
Do you hear that, Chief?

176
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,811
Sounds like the Doppler
compensators are out of phase.

177
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,105
Ensign, how's she handling?

178
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,607
She's not quite as smooth
as the old <i>Defiant,</i> sir.

179
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,651
Feels a bit sluggish.

180
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:34,819
Chief?

181
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,862
I'm on it. O'Brien to Engineering.

182
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:37,822
CREWMAN: ( on com ) <i>Engineering.</i>

183
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,659
Recalibrate the inertial dampers
and check the plasma flow regulators

184
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:42,660
while you're at it.

185
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:43,577
CREWMAN:<i> Right away, Chief.</i>

186
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,163
You think someone would've come up
with a better inertial control system.

187
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,081
What's that, Miles?

188
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,878
I said, I wish you'd wipe
that grin off your face.

189
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,965
You're not the first person
to fall in love, you know.

190
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,635
-I thought you'd be happy for me.
-I am happy for you.

191
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,304
O'Brien to Engineering.

192
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,264
CREWMAN: <i>Engineering.</i>

193
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,182
Now try realigning the induction coils.

194
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,392
<i>Will do.</i>

195
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,271
You're sure you're not angry.

196
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,148
Why should I be angry?

197
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:17,611
I have been asking you to tell the doctor
how you feel about him for the past month.

198
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,531
Well... now that he knows how I feel...

199
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,199
I am happy for you.

200
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,368
That's a relief.

201
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:28,581
But... I am going to kill him.

202
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,292
You're kidding, right?

203
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,838
And Jadzia said I did not
have a sense of humor.

204
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:41,510
Julian, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

205
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,846
You're getting pressure
from Keiko, aren't you?

206
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,264
How did you know?

207
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,474
It's a big decision.

208
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,268
I'm surprised it didn't come up sooner.

209
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,104
Actually we've been talking
about it for quite a while.

210
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:56,066
Well, you can stop talking about it.
We'll move the Alamo into my quarters.

211
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:59,862
NOG: I could still use a little more
equalization on the torque buffers.

212
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:01,780
Uh, right.

213
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,909
I'll try to compensate
with the impulse response filters.

214
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,577
That way, your quarters
won't be so cluttered

215
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,746
and, uh, you can still use it
whenever you want.

216
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:12,291
I wasn't talking about the Alamo model.

217
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,668
Besides, it's too big for your quarters.

218
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,587
You let me worry about that.

219
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,881
So... what were you talking about?

220
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,551
Oh, it's nothing that can't wait.

221
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,471
Is that any better, Nog?

222
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,097
Torque buffers are stable.

223
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:29,433
I wish she were here, too, Constable.

224
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:36,106
If we only knew where Kira was.

225
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,108
If we could only be sure
that she was all right.

226
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,610
The Colonel's a survivor.

227
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:48,244
This war, Captain... it has to end.

228
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,412
And it will... soon.

229
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,040
One way or the other.

230
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,626
Mother?

231
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,588
The Emissary's task is nearing completion.

232
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:02,049
Are you talking about the war?

233
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:07,763
You have walked the path
the Prophets laid out for you, Benjamin.

234
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,808
Do not falter now.

235
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,185
I don't intend to.

236
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,818
Know this... my son.

237
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:26,657
Your journey's end lies not before you...

238
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,368
but behind you.

239
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:35,416
ODO: Captain?

240
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:36,917
Captain...

241
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:38,961
The Prophets...

242
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,171
came to me in a vision.

243
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:46,260
I take it they weren't bringing good news.

244
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,179
I'm not sure.

245
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,557
Only time will tell.

246
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,150
( door opening )

247
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,863
Hello, Adami.

248
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,406
You're back.

249
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:11,744
( sighs )

250
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,829
Is that all you have to say to me?

251
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,251
I see the Pah-wraiths
have restored your sight.

252
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,378
Yes, they've forgiven me.

253
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:25,841
I was hoping you could find it
in your heart to do the same.

254
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,427
I don't forgive war criminals.

255
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:34,725
To think I took Gul Dukat to my bed

256
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:38,938
one of the most hated men
in Bajoran history.

257
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,649
I've already told you
how much I regret my actions

258
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,400
during the occupation.

259
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,235
Of course you do.

260
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:53,911
Have you learned how to release
the Pah-wraiths?

261
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:59,541
The secrets of the <i>Kosst Amojan</i>
have been revealed to me, yes.

262
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:03,796
Then why haven't you gone
to the Fire Caves and freed them?

263
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:05,839
I was waiting for you.

264
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:10,761
Then you do forgive me.

265
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,976
I need your help, Dukat.
It's as simple as that.

266
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:24,149
All you have to do is ask.
Together, we will release the Pah-wraiths

267
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,528
so they can lay claim
to the Celestial Temple

268
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,488
and destroy the Prophets.

269
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,323
And their Emissary.

270
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,242
No, no, no.

271
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:37,830
Benjamin Sisko will be dealt with by me...

272
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,790
and me alone.

273
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,502
Assuming he survives
the invasion of Cardassia.

274
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:44,962
Oh, he'll survive...

275
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,464
but I promise you...

276
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,676
he'll wish he hadn't.

277
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,107
You going to sit there all night, Quark?

278
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,901
Got any... threes?

279
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,029
Go fish.

280
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,535
Don't tell me you're quitting?

281
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,037
It's just not my game.

282
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,955
Well, you want to try pinochle again?

283
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,917
How about rummy? Or gin rummy?
Five card stud?

284
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:25,711
Uh, canasta?

285
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,171
How about some tongo?

286
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:30,215
Did they play tongo in Las Vegas in 1962?

287
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,925
How could they? It's a Ferengi game.

288
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,554
Which is why my holographic
program can't create it.

289
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,682
I know, I know.
This place is period specific.

290
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:43,979
For a hologram,
you're not very accommodating.

291
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,690
Oh, is that why you dropped by,
to insult me?

292
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,818
I dropped by
because I had nothing else to do.

293
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,654
My bar hasn't had half a dozen
customers all day.

294
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,408
Everyone's off fighting this stupid war.

295
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:02,289
It's not easy staying behind, is it?
Knowing your friends are out there

296
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,248
risking their lives?

297
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,543
They think they have it rough?

298
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,588
They should try leading my life for a day.

299
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,217
The hospitality industry
isn't for the fainthearted.

300
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,677
A bartender's life is a lonely one.

301
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,597
That's true, but few people understand it.

302
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,433
They think it's one big happy party.

303
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,936
They forget that the person
giving the party never has any fun.

304
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,605
He's too busy making sure
everyone else is having fun.

305
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:31,652
All I do, all day long,
is give, give, give.

306
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,322
Bartending is a very noble profession
and you do it well

307
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,784
under some very difficult circumstances
I might add.

308
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,077
You should be proud.

309
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,079
Think so?

310
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,622
I know so, pally.

311
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,167
I just hope Nog...

312
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,380
and the rest of those heroic idiots
come back in one piece.

313
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,589
There you are.

314
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,678
Vic, sweetie, are you ready?
Jimmy and Peter are about to go on.

315
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,472
Sorry, pally, got to run.

316
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:04,268
Durante and Lawford are at the Sands.
Can't miss that.

317
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:07,771
I thought you said a bartender's life
was a lonely one.

318
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,440
It is, but I'm not a bartender.

319
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,116
Huh.

320
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,995
Go fish.

321
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:39,803
( groaning )

322
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:43,348
Is it really necessary to rest so often?

323
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,145
You don't need to wait for me.
Go on ahead.

324
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:53,650
Wander aimlessly through these caves
for the rest of your miserable life.

325
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,738
I'm in no hurry.

326
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,701
During the occupation

327
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:09,416
my people found the Bajorans' fear
of these caves amusing...

328
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,462
and yet, we never took
the time to visit them...

329
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,298
and now here I am.

330
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,384
It's ironic, isn't it?

331
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,220
I don't care.

332
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,349
Excuse me, I just meant--

333
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,851
I'm sure you
have many interesting anecdotes

334
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:32,231
about the occupation
but I don't have any desire to hear them.

335
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,816
I meant no disrespect, Adami.

336
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,152
And stop calling me "Adami."

337
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,197
That privilege is no longer yours.

338
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,660
How should I address you, then?

339
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,247
From now on, you will address me
as "Eminence."

340
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:49,915
Is that clear?

341
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:52,709
Perfectly...

342
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,549
Eminence.

343
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,100
I see your point

344
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:12,437
but for two millennia,
the Jem'Hadar have been

345
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:17,192
the Dominion's first line of defense.
It would damage their morale

346
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,319
to have to take a backseat to the Breen.

347
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:21,196
( distorted voice )

348
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:22,948
Very well.

349
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:27,244
In the spirit of our new alliance
I will inform the Jem'Hadar

350
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:30,414
that the Breen forces will stand
alongside them.

351
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:32,416
( distorted voice )

352
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,501
I'm glad that pleases you.

353
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,086
I think we have a problem.

354
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,380
( distorted voice )

355
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:43,302
Our lines are spread too thin,
especially here, at the center.

356
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,263
WEYOUN: We need to dispatch
reinforcements immediately.

357
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,182
-Do you agree?
-( distorted voice )

358
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,935
Notify the Jem'Hadar.

359
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,147
Order them to reinforce
the center of their lines.

360
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,191
Now what?

361
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,027
( distorted voice )

362
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,279
COMPUTER:<i> Emergency power engaged.</i>

363
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:08,952
Founder, I'm relieved
to see that you're all right.

364
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,496
WEYOUN: Long-range
communications are down.

365
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,082
I can't contact the Jem'Hadar.

366
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,293
-( distorted voice )
-Of course I'll keep trying.

367
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:20,297
-What caused the power failure?
-I'm afraid it was sabotage.

368
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:24,968
Almost every Dominion installation
on Cardassian Prime has suffered damage.

369
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:26,845
Damar.

370
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,848
We captured some of the terrorists

371
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:33,602
but they're not soldiers,
they're ordinary citizens.

372
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,772
Are you telling me

373
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:40,108
that the Cardassian people
are rising up against us?

374
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:43,111
I'm sure it's only a small
number of malcontents.

375
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,864
But we have no way of knowing that, do we?

376
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,492
Founder, may I make a suggestion?

377
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,411
Yes, I am sure that Broca
will be very happy

378
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,996
to hear what you have to say.

379
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:57,334
If the Cardassian people are responsible
for these acts of terrorism...

380
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:01,046
if Damar and his fanatics
have turned them against us

381
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,466
then it's the people
who should be punished.

382
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,927
Now, what do you say to that?

383
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,471
( strained ) Severely punished.

384
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,682
Well, I'm glad we all agree.

385
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:13,934
See to it.

386
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:29,991
DAMAR: It's been 24 minutes.

387
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:30,909
Not bad.

388
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:34,246
If the Dominion hasn't been able
to restore power to the capital

389
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,456
then the entire planet must be in chaos.

390
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:37,791
I hope so.

391
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:41,002
I'm afraid I was only able
to find two more light sticks.

392
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,338
There's more about the house
somewhere, but I--

393
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:45,715
Would you stop dawdling
and give them to me?

394
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:49,928
Oh, well, I remember that tone of voice.
It reminds me of the demanding

395
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:52,389
and inconsiderate boy you used to be.

396
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,141
I haven't changed much, have I?

397
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,351
DAMAR: This will send a clear message
to the Dominion,

398
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,396
the Cardassian people will fight
to regain their freedom.

399
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,773
I hope they realize
their fight is just beginning.

400
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,151
We're going to have to hit the enemy again
and harder this time.

401
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:07,404
Well, that won't be easy.
They will have tightened their security.

402
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,948
Well, that doesn't matter.
We can't lose our momentum.

403
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:14,786
The Commander is right.
We cannot rest until Cardassia is free.

404
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:19,541
And when it is,
we'll have you to thank for it.

405
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:24,004
Without you, this rebellion
would have died in its infancy.

406
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:29,509
Ironic, isn't it? The savior of Cardassia
a former Bajoran terrorist?

407
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,511
Well, don't canonize me just yet.

408
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:35,640
It's been 26 and a half minutes.

409
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:38,351
Let's see what the Dominion
has to say for itself.

410
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:42,898
<i>Citizens of Cardassia </i>
<i>this latest wave of vandalism</i>

411
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:47,068
<i>directed against </i>
<i>your Dominion allies must stop.</i>

412
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,403
I wouldn't count on it.

413
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:51,031
WEYOUN:<i> We know that these disgraceful </i>
<i>acts of sabotage</i>

414
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:54,367
<i>were carried out</i>
<i>by a mere handful of extremists</i>

415
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,786
<i>but these radicals must come to realize</i>

416
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:00,165
<i>that their disobedience</i>
<i>will not be tolerated.</i>

417
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:05,295
<i>That you, the Cardassian people,</i>
<i>will suffer the consequences</i>

418
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:07,464
<i>of their cowardly actions.</i>

419
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:13,678
<i>Which is why I must inform you,</i>
<i>a few moments ago</i>

420
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:19,392
<i>Dominion troops</i>
<i>reduced Lakarian City to ashes.</i>

421
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,270
<i>There were no survivors.</i>

422
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:26,608
<i>Two million men, women and children</i>

423
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,653
<i>gone in a matter of moments.</i>

424
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,573
<i>For each act of sabotage</i>
<i>committed against the Dominion</i>

425
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,243
<i>another Cardassian city will be destroyed.</i>

426
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,913
<i>I implore you not to let that happen.</i>

427
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:44,751
<i>Let us return to the spirit</i>
<i>of friendship and cooperation</i>

428
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,211
<i>between our peoples</i>

429
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:50,465
<i>so that together, we can destroy</i>
<i>our common enemies</i>

430
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,177
<i>the Federation, the Klingons, the Romulans</i>

431
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:56,388
<i>and all the others that stand against us.</i>

432
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:58,890
<i>Thank you.</i>

433
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:03,186
I should have killed
that Vorta jackal when I had the chance.

434
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:06,481
You want another one?
We'll attack Dominion Headquarters.

435
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,858
Chop off a snake's head
and the body will die.

436
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,026
KIRA: Exactly.

437
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,613
Damar, for the past two years
you've practically lived in that building.

438
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:16,533
If you're asking me
if I know a way in the answer is no,

439
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,619
not without a valid security protocol.

440
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,037
All right, we'll use force.

441
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:22,998
We're going to need
some kind of explosives.

442
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,124
I'll get right on it.

443
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,501
What you're proposing is suicide.

444
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:29,629
If you have nothing positive
to say, Mila...

445
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,840
All right, I'll prepare some food.

446
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,551
Nobody should die on an empty stomach.

447
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,432
Sir, Chancellor Martok

448
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:42,309
would like to speak to you
and Admiral Ross.

449
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:43,435
Put them through.

450
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:44,936
MARTOK: <i>Gentlemen...</i>

451
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,605
<i>a magnificent victory lies before us.</i>

452
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:50,608
<i>I trust those</i>
<i>are prophetic words, Chancellor.</i>

453
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:55,238
<i>They are... and I've not forgotten</i>
<i>the promise I made to both of you.</i>

454
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:58,867
That the three of us would share
a bottle of bloodwine on Cardassia Prime.

455
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,076
<i>"A bottle"?</i>

456
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,369
( chuckles )

457
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:06,416
<i>I brought a barrel of 2309.</i>
<i>There is no finer vintage.</i>

458
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,377
<i>Then I'll meet you both on Cardassia.</i>

459
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,379
<i>We'll see who gets there first.</i>

460
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,217
The Chancellor makes victory sound easy.

461
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:21,723
He knows it won't be. Sisko to all hands.
Prepare to engage the enemy.

462
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:50,418
I'll say one thing for the Breen,
they know how to pilot their ships.

463
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,587
-So do you, Ensign.
-Stay with him.

464
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,589
I'm trying, but he's slippery.

465
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:55,882
Mr. Worf?

466
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,967
Unable to lock target.

467
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:06,684
We have two Jem'Hadar ships
closing aft of us, bearing 136 mark 4.

468
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,269
Evasive action, pattern delta.

469
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:10,814
Hang on.

470
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,117
Well done, Ensign.

471
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:24,119
But I lost the Breen ship we were after.

472
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:27,872
I wouldn't worry about it.
There are plenty more to choose from.

473
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:43,805
You've hardly touched your meal.
No wonder you're not looking well.

474
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,183
I'm not looking well
because I live in a cellar.

475
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,185
Well, so does Legate Damar.

476
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:50,311
And what about him?

477
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,647
Well, he's finished
everything on his plate

478
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,107
which explains

479
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,110
why he is such a fine,
handsome figure of a man.

480
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,570
Oh, I'm afraid I don't follow you.

481
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:01,489
I do. Mila, I believe
you're falling in love.

482
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,700
Oh, I'm old enough to be his mother.

483
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:04,826
Ah-ah.

484
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,036
Nonsense.

485
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:08,997
Politicians.

486
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,625
( door chimes )

487
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,085
Now, who could that be?

488
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:16,045
Uh... I'll go see.

489
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,389
Uh, may I help you?

490
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,767
( whispering ) What's taking her so long?

491
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:30,226
I don't know.

492
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,563
( door opening )

493
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:34,731
( loud thud )

494
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:38,151
Mila!

495
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,237
KIRA: Garak!

496
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,823
Garak, get out of there!

497
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,201
( grunting )

498
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,205
( coughing )

499
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,706
( grunting in pain )

500
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:54,375
( grunts )

501
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,252
I can't look away for a second.

502
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,753
Just fix the shoulder.

503
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,047
Careful!

504
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,341
Sit still or you'll end up
with one arm shorter than the other.

505
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:46,970
You'd do anything to beat me at darts.

506
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:49,389
I haven't lost a game to you in months.

507
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,932
I'm going to miss our games, Julian.

508
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,310
What are you talking about?
You're going to be fine.

509
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:57,272
I'm leaving DS9, Julian.
I'm moving back to Earth.

510
00:30:58,314 --> 00:30:59,148
Why?

511
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:02,610
I've been offered
a position at the Starfleet Academy...

512
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,404
Professor of Engineering.

513
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:05,613
When?

514
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,032
When the war's over.

515
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,493
Oh... I see.

516
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,997
Somebody has to teach you officers
the difference between a warp matrix

517
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,376
flux capacitor
and a self-sealing stem bolt.

518
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:20,879
Of course, of course.

519
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,005
( computer beeping )

520
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,464
EZRI: Captain, Admiral Ross for you.

521
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:24,507
On screen.

522
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,634
ROSS: <i>The Romulan flagship's</i>

523
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,053
<i>been destroyed.</i>
<i>Their entire line is collapsing.</i>

524
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:30,722
We'll try to help.

525
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:33,933
<i>With what?</i>
<i>Ben, we're losing too many ships.</i>

526
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:36,227
<i>We've got to find a way to turn</i>
<i>the Dominion's left flank.</i>

527
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,478
It's too well protected

528
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,647
but their lines are spread
pretty thin in the middle.

529
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,818
<i>You help the Romulans.</i>
<i>Martok and I will hit the center.</i>

530
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,069
On my way.

531
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,947
Dax, have attack wings
64 and 65 follow us.

532
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:48,990
Aye, sir.

533
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,784
What's taking so long?

534
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:54,996
Our engineers have assured me
that our long-range communications

535
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,748
will be restored momentarily.

536
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:59,208
But you have been saying that for hours

537
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:02,503
and meantime, there's no way
of contacting our ships

538
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,590
no way of knowing
how the battle is progressing.

539
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,674
BROCA: Founder

540
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,510
our troops have captured
the traitor Damar.

541
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:13,014
Finally... some good news.

542
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:17,852
And there's more. Colonel Kira
and Garak have been apprehended with him.

543
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:21,189
Even better.
Shall I have them brought here?

544
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:23,399
What for?

545
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,861
Have them executed...

546
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:29,072
immediately.

547
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,951
With pleasure

548
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:44,087
Understood. It will be done at once.
On your feet.

549
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,463
Why?

550
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:49,133
We prefer our prisoners
to be standing when they die.

551
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:55,056
Does anyone have any last words?

552
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:57,684
You may kill us,
but Cardassia will never--

553
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:58,685
JEM'HADAR: Enough.

554
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:02,230
-Final words are not permitted.
-How disappointing.

555
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:03,523
Ready weapons.

556
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,234
On my mark.

557
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,575
That's for Lakarian City.

558
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:24,210
Legate Damar, I pledge my life
to free Cardassia from the Dominion.

559
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:28,339
With men like you on our side...
how can we fail?

560
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,273
( yells )

561
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:48,192
Jem'Hadar ship off the port bow.

562
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,111
WORF: Shields are down to 60 percent.

563
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:53,614
Miles, this is no good.
I'm going to have to get you to Sick Bay.

564
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,325
-I'm kind of busy right now.
-That's an order.

565
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,369
-Look, Julian!
-You heard him, Chief.

566
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,371
Yes, sir.

567
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:02,415
Another Jem'Hadar to port.

568
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:03,708
( console beeping )

569
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,960
Transferring auxiliary power
to the port shields.

570
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,671
Dax, we need some support
from our attack fighters.

571
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:09,797
Aye, sir.

572
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,842
Breen ship off the starboard aft.

573
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,177
EZRI: Sir, most of our fighters

574
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,637
are either destroyed
or under attack themselves.

575
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,306
Ensign, get us out of here.

576
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:20,975
I'm trying, sir.

577
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:40,453
Sir, the Cardassians... they're attacking
the other Dominion ships.

578
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,798
They've switched sides.

579
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,424
Yes!

580
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,093
The timing couldn't be better.

581
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,887
Come about and head
for the center of their lines.

582
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,972
This is our chance to punch through.

583
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,224
NOG: Aye, sir.

584
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:10,191
Founder, our long-range communications
are back on line.

585
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,818
It's about time.

586
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,115
I don't believe it.

587
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:19,826
What now?

588
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:23,204
The Cardassian fleet
has turned against us.

589
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:26,833
( distorted voice )

590
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:31,796
Have our forces pull back
and regroup at Cardassia Prime.

591
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,215
But we'll be totally surrounded.

592
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,384
There will be no more running.

593
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,927
( distorted voice )

594
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,012
We should've rid ourselves
of the Cardassians

595
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:42,265
at the first sign of rebellion.

596
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:48,104
If I could talk to the rebels
get them to change their minds.

597
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:51,315
Perhaps you could reawaken
their patriotic spirit.

598
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,233
Exactly.

599
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:57,572
On the other hand, they're just as likely
to convince you to betray us.

600
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,158
Me? Betray you?

601
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:01,993
-Never!
-That's right.

602
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:04,495
We are not going to give you
that opportunity.

603
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,249
Wait! You're making a terrible mistake.

604
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,167
I don't think so.

605
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,127
But I've done everything you've asked.

606
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:16,174
I tell you, I'm loyal!
I believe in the Dominion! No! Wait! No!

607
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:18,426
I won't miss him.

608
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,512
I want the Cardassians exterminated.

609
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:22,847
Which ones?

610
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:28,895
-All of them, the entire population.
-That will take some time.

611
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,689
Then I suggest that you begin at once.

612
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:50,833
Captain, the Dominion forces
are retreating towards Cardassia Prime.

613
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:55,046
Sir? Admiral Ross and Chancellor Martok
would like to talk to you.

614
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:56,547
On screen.

615
00:36:56,964 --> 00:37:00,509
<i>I never thought I'd say this</i>
<i>but thank God for the Cardassians.</i>

616
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:03,888
<i>As I predicted, the day is ours.</i>

617
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:05,556
Not yet, it isn't.

618
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,893
<i>Ben, we've driven the Dominion</i>
<i>back into Cardassia Prime.</i>

619
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:11,395
<i>We can keep them bottled up</i>
<i>there indefinitely.</i>

620
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,606
What if they use this time
to rebuild their fleet?

621
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:17,109
<i>He's right. The Dominion </i>
<i>has displayed an ability</i>

622
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,445
<i>to build ships at an impressive rate.</i>

623
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,322
<i>We should continue the attack.</i>

624
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:25,409
<i>At what cost?</i>
<i>We've already lost a third of our fleet.</i>

625
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:29,747
<i>Then we must see to it</i>
<i>that those soldiers did not die in vain.</i>

626
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:34,335
Admiral, with the Cardassians joining us
we have an opportunity

627
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,796
to put an end to this war
once and for all.

628
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:43,302
<i>All right, gentlemen.</i> <i>We press on.</i>

629
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:48,015
<i>My friends, </i>
<i>songs will be sung about this day.</i>

630
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:55,606
All right, people... you heard the orders.
Let's finish what we started.

631
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:10,454
DUKAT: Let me guess...

632
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,375
we're here.

633
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:20,756
We've reached the end of one journey
and stand ready to begin another.

634
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:29,724
What's the matter, Dukat?
You look disappointed.

635
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:35,521
Well, this may sound naive,
but I was expecting to see fire.

636
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:38,649
They are called the fire caves.

637
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:41,360
And with good reason.

638
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:53,331
<i>Lano ka'la bo'shar</i> <i>lanu no'vala</i>

639
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:56,334
<i>pahrom carana mokado ba'jah.</i>

640
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,628
<i>Ko'se nusso</i> <i>ma'kora kajani...</i>

641
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:04,008
<i>lano ka'la Kosst Amojan.</i>

642
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:12,975
Is that better?

643
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:39,293
According to this map, it's a long way
from the cargo door to the briefing room.

644
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,837
Well, that could be a problem
if we get trapped in the corridor.

645
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:43,964
-( explosion )
-What the hell?

646
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:47,051
It's the Jem'Hadar. They're leveling
the city, building by building.

647
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,552
All right, we have to go now.

648
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,721
Once we get inside the complex

649
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,807
we stop at nothing
until we capture the changeling.

650
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,308
SOLDIER: Let it be done! We're with you!

651
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,351
For Cardassia!

652
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,436
ALL: For Cardassia!

653
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:01,732
Garak.

654
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,859
All during the years of my exile

655
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:06,404
I imagined what it would
be like to come home.

656
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:09,073
I even thought of living
in this house again

657
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,199
with Mila...

658
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,660
but now she's dead

659
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:15,871
and this house is about to be reduced
to a pile of rubble.

660
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:20,876
-My Cardassia is gone.
-Then fight for a new Cardassia.

661
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,129
( explosion )

662
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:26,298
I have an even better reason, Commander.

663
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,134
Revenge.

664
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,053
That works, too.

665
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,280
Oh!

666
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:54,660
I rid myself of the Prophets
and shed a lifetime of hypocrisy.

667
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:06,881
I've never seen you look so radiant.

668
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:11,051
I feel like a young woman
waiting for my lover to sweep me away.

669
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,138
Do you give yourself willingly
to the Pah-wraiths?

670
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:18,309
-With all my heart.
-Then call to them.

671
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,520
Bring me the book.

672
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,363
<i>Meek rak dorrah Pah-wran.</i>

673
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:34,074
<i>Yelim cha ono</i> <i>Kosst Amojan...</i>

674
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,660
<i>shay ta-hel ter-rah</i>

675
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:37,953
<i>no'vala de-ram...</i>

676
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:47,421
Sisko to Bashir. Report.

677
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:49,924
Three dead, eight wounded,
four of them critically.

678
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,510
SISKO:<i> Doctor, I need every able-bodied</i>
<i>crewman at their post.</i>

679
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:55,262
I won't keep anybody here
a second longer than I have to, sir.

680
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,681
Put him over here, will you?

681
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:01,060
She did pretty well for a first date
don't you think, Captain?

682
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,854
I'd say she did fine, Ensign.

683
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,149
Mr. Worf.

684
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:13,072
Sir, phaser banks are fully charged
but we are down to 45 quantum torpedoes.

685
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:16,992
That'll have to do.
How are you holding up, old man?

686
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,789
All things considered
I think I'd rather be on Risa.

687
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:25,251
Well... that makes two of us.

688
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,215
Have you seen these reports, Captain?

689
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:35,094
The Dominion has begun
destroying Cardassian cities.

690
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:36,845
Millions of people are dying.

691
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:40,182
NOG: Captain, we're approaching
the Dominion defense perimeter.

692
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:41,934
Well...

693
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:47,731
let's see what they have waiting for us.
On screen.

694
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:05,958
Now we know.

695
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,592
( distant explosions )

696
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:17,886
-We have a problem.
-Just one?

697
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:21,890
I'm afraid it's a rather large problem.
The cargo door is made of neutronium.

698
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:26,312
Then the explosives we brought
aren't even going to make a dent.

699
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:28,731
-You see the problem.
-What do we do?

700
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,025
I don't know

701
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:33,360
but I'm through hiding in basements.

702
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,699
I fail to see what is so funny, Garak.

703
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:44,788
Well, isn't it obvious?
Here we are, ready to storm the castle

704
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:48,667
willing to sacrifice our lives
in the noble effort

705
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:51,754
to slay the Dominion beast in its lair...

706
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:53,213
( Kira and Garak laughing )

707
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:56,467
we can't even get inside the gates.

708
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,886
( Kira and Garak laughing )

709
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:01,221
Maybe... maybe...
we could go up to the door, and...

710
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:05,225
and ask the Jem'Hadar to let us in?

711
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,186
Why don't we just have them
send the shape-shifter out to us?

712
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:09,313
( all laughing )

713
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:17,696
As I said... we have a problem.

714
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:24,995
But I've come to depend
on having you here at my side.

715
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,497
( distorted voice )

716
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:30,000
Your advice to the Dominion
has proven invaluable.

717
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:32,169
( distorted voice )

718
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:35,798
Very well. If you feel the situation
on the front lines

719
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:39,426
demands your presence
I will not stand in your way.

720
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:42,554
Knowing that you'll be leading
our troops into battle

721
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,640
is very reassuring.

722
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:47,559
( distorted voice )

723
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:56,276
I still can't help but wonder.

724
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:59,947
-Wonder what?
-What's under that helmet.

725
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:03,283
A braver man than you are.

726
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:09,706
Though I do find the shrillness
of his voice very... tiresome.

727
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:13,752
Founder, what's wrong?

728
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:17,506
I'm dying.

729
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,050
That's what's wrong.

730
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:24,596
Perhaps you should rest for a while
revert to your natural state.

731
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:29,643
I haven't been able
to change form in weeks.

732
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:38,110
It's ironic, isn't it?
That I should die as a solid.

733
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:42,030
You're not going to die. You're a God.

734
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:48,996
My loyal Weyoun...
the only solid I have ever trusted.

735
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:53,167
I live only to serve you.

736
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,878
And you have served me well.

737
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:03,760
I don't mind dying.
It's knowing that my entire race

738
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:09,558
is dying of the same illness
and there is nothing I can do about it.

739
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:15,189
I would give my life to save yours.

740
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:19,318
If only it were that simple.

741
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:26,074
What if I give myself up
pretend to be your prisoner?

742
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:29,203
-They'd kill you on sight.
-And us along with you.

743
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,662
( door opening )

744
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:31,997
The cargo door...

745
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,333
MALE: You're making a terrible mistake!

746
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:39,046
I'm not a traitor!
Please, just let me speak to the Founder!

747
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:41,381
No! Wait! No!

748
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:42,841
( painful groaning )

749
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:43,926
No!

750
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,763
For Cardassia!

751
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:49,515
ALL: For Cardassia!

752
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,391
( groans )

753
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:02,236
( groaning )

754
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,154
Fall back! Fall back!

755
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:15,624
Keep...

756
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:19,461
He's dead.

757
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:24,049
Remember his orders. We stop for nothing.

758
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:28,011
For Cardassia!

759
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,055
ALL: Cardassia!

760
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:32,975
We have a security breach.

761
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,060
The guards will deal with it.

762
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,022
Is there a problem?

763
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:42,901
The guards... there's only a handful
left in the building.

764
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:46,196
I sent the rest to help
eradicate the Cardassians.

765
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,490
( phasers firing )

766
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,075
You two, get out there

767
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:51,910
and see that no one
gets through that door.

768
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:57,165
You stay here in case they fail.

769
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:04,840
<i>We'll launch a three-pronged attack.</i>

770
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:07,509
<i>The Romulans and our new Cardassian allies</i>

771
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:11,638
<i>will engage the Jem'Hadar forces.</i>
<i>The Klingons will target the Breen</i>

772
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:15,183
<i>and the Federation</i>
<i>will take on the orbital weapon platforms.</i>

773
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:16,768
<i>Any questions?</i>

774
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:17,978
When do we go?

775
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,521
<i>As soon as everyone's in position.</i>

776
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:22,566
<i>It will be a glorious battle.</i>

777
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:25,110
<i>But a costly one.</i>
<i>Estimates project our casualties</i>

778
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:27,070
<i>to be as high as 40 percent.</i>

779
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:30,157
<i>There's no telling how</i>
<i>much higher they'll go</i>

780
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,491
<i>once we send in our ground forces.</i>

781
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,869
The Dominion is beaten and they know it

782
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:37,956
but they're going to make us pay
for every kilometer of the planet.

783
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,666
<i>Yes, they will.</i>

784
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:42,919
Let's get on with it.

785
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:45,631
Godspeed, everyone.

786
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:46,923
<i>Qapla'.</i>

787
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:49,301
( phasers firing )

788
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:52,804
Founder, perhaps we should consider
finding a safer location.

789
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,348
And just where would that be?

790
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:57,517
( yelling )

791
00:49:09,946 --> 00:49:11,031
Well...

792
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:15,786
Colonel Kira... what a pleasant surprise.

793
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,746
The pleasure's all mine.

794
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:20,999
The Federation fleet
has surrounded the planet.

795
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,835
I want you to contact
the Jem'Hadar and the Breen

796
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:26,922
and you order their ships to stand down.

797
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:29,383
And order the troops on Cardassia
to do the same.

798
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:31,718
I will do no such thing.

799
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:35,430
Tell me, where is my old friend Damar?

800
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:37,015
Damar is dead.

801
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:39,226
What a pity.

802
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,895
He died trying to free Cardassia.

803
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:44,272
What's left of it.

804
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,659
I wish you hadn't done that.

805
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:58,995
That was Weyoun's last clone.

806
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:01,081
I was hoping you'd say that.

807
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:07,254
This war's over. You lost.

808
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:08,296
Have I?

809
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:13,218
I think you'll find
that neither the Jem'Hadar

810
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:16,263
or the Breen will agree
with that assessment.

811
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:21,435
-They will fight to the last man.
-And what will that accomplish?

812
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:24,688
Isn't it obvious?

813
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:31,403
You may win this war, Commander
but I promise you, when it is over

814
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:35,991
you will have lost
so many ships, so many lives

815
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:41,037
that your victory will taste
as bitter as defeat.

816
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:50,672
We're glad to find you
in one piece, Commander.

817
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:51,798
Very glad.

818
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:53,133
SISKO: What's your status?

819
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:55,552
<i>Only three of us</i>
<i>made it to the briefing room.</i>

820
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:57,262
What about Damar?

821
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:58,847
<i>He's dead.</i>

822
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:02,559
Is your position secure?

823
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:07,898
<i>I don't think the Jem'Hadar will attack.</i>
<i>They won't risk endangering the Founder</i>

824
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:11,777
<i>and she's in pretty bad shape.</i>
<i>She just sits at her desk</i>

825
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,111
<i>deteriorating.</i>

826
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:15,906
If she dies before ordering
the Jem'Hadar to surrender...

827
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:18,283
Then they will fight to the last man.

828
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:19,785
Captain,

829
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:22,954
I should beam down there.
The Founder will speak to me.

830
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:24,206
I can reason with her.

831
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:27,667
You haven't had much success
with her in the past.

832
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:30,545
It's worth a try.
Think of the lives it could save.

833
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,174
Very well.

834
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:35,884
Commander,

835
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:39,596
tell the Founder that Odo
is going to pay her a visit.

836
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:55,570
<i>Tarna pur-ono</i> <i>ull-kess Pah-wran.</i>

837
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:59,324
<i>Lano ka'la</i> <i>bo'shar lanu.</i>

838
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:04,204
After you.

839
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,374
I'm honored.

840
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:17,300
Now you.

841
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:37,904
Why?

842
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:43,994
The Pah-wraiths demand a sacrifice
someone worthy of them.

843
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:45,328
Who better than you?

844
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:11,229
I offer you this life as nourishment
to feed your hunger

845
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:14,774
to fuel the fires that will set you free.

846
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:22,699
Kosst Amojan, I am yours, now and forever!

847
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:30,457
( whir of active transport )

848
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:34,878
Nerys...

849
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:40,550
-It's been a while.
-Yes.

850
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:43,386
Watch yourself. I don't trust her.

851
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:45,764
But you trust me?

852
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:47,849
Of course.

853
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:50,810
That's all I need to know.

854
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:53,980
Constable.

855
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,231
Garak.

856
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:57,984
You're looking well, Odo.

857
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:00,320
Thank you for seeing me.

858
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:03,823
It's always good to see you...

859
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:07,953
but I have no intention
of surrendering my forces.

860
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:12,832
It would be a sign of weakness on my part
an invitation to the solids

861
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:16,753
to cross into the Gamma Quadrant
and destroy the Great Link.

862
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:20,757
Believe me, I'm well aware
that the Federation has its flaws

863
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,259
but a desire for conquest
isn't one of them.

864
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:29,057
And what of the Klingons and the Romulans?
Can you make that claim for them, too?

865
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:31,142
The Klingon and Romulan Empires

866
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:33,645
are in no shape to wage
war against anyone.

867
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:37,148
Besides, the Federation wouldn't allow it.

868
00:54:37,273 --> 00:54:41,903
The Dominion has spent the last two years
trying to destroy the Federation

869
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:45,824
and now you're asking me
to put our fate in their hands?

870
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:47,409
Yes.

871
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:50,286
I can't do that, Odo.

872
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:55,875
-I don't have your faith in the solids.
-But perhaps I can change your mind.

873
00:54:58,128 --> 00:54:59,129
Link with me.

874
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:02,048
Odo, what are you doing?

875
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:08,638
I'm afraid I can't link with you, Odo.
My disease prevents me from changing form.

876
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:12,976
If we link, I believe I can cure you.

877
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:15,228
That's a very bad idea, Constable.

878
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:16,229
I agree.

879
00:55:16,312 --> 00:55:21,484
Nerys, I know what I'm doing.
Please, take my hand.

880
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:27,240
And if you cure me,
what will you ask in return?

881
00:55:27,323 --> 00:55:30,285
All I ask is that you link with me.

882
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,162
I'm warning you, Odo.

883
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:33,413
Nerys...

884
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:38,001
Garak, put down your weapon.

885
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:39,169
I don't think so.

886
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:41,713
I said put it down.

887
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:08,490
Move aside, Odo.

888
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:12,285
That won't be necessary... will it?

889
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:22,921
If you will stand aside
I'll order the Jem'Hadar to cease fire.

890
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:27,675
I suggest we secure her
in a containment field.

891
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:28,802
ODO: Don't worry, Garak.

892
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:31,137
She won't try to escape.

893
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:33,181
She's agreed to stand trial

894
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:35,767
and accept responsibility
for what she's done.

895
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:44,067
I would've thought she'd insist
on going back to the Gamma Quadrant

896
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:47,070
-to cure her people.
-There's no need for that.

897
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:50,949
I'm going in her place.

898
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:54,536
For how long?

899
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:56,746
Nerys...

900
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:02,293
it's time I rejoined the Great Link.

901
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:18,017
This is a moment worth savoring.

902
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:20,979
To victory...

903
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:23,857
hard fought

904
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:26,192
and well earned.

905
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:34,534
What's wrong?

906
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:36,828
Suddenly, I'm not thirsty.

907
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:38,997
Neither am I.

908
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:46,129
Before you waste too many tears
remember... these are Cardassians

909
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:50,717
lying dead at your feet.
Bajorans would call this...

910
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:52,677
poetic justice.

911
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:57,807
That doesn't mean I have to drink
a toast over their bodies.

912
00:57:57,891 --> 00:57:58,892
( bloodwine splattering )

913
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:12,572
Humans...

914
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:15,283
( speaking Klingon )

915
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:25,043
Eight hundred million dead.

916
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:28,338
And casualty reports still coming in.

917
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:33,843
Well, aren't you going
to congratulate me, Doctor?

918
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:38,431
My exile is now officially over.
I've returned home...

919
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:41,392
or rather, to what's left of it.

920
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:45,396
Listen, I-I know that this must seem--

921
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:49,108
You know, some may say
that we've gotten just what we deserved.

922
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:52,195
After all, we're not entirely innocent,
are we?

923
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:55,573
And I'm not just speaking
of the Bajoran occupation.

924
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:59,452
No, our whole history
is one of arrogant aggression.

925
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:04,958
We've collaborated with the Dominion
betrayed the entire Alpha Quadrant.

926
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:11,256
Oh, no, no, there's no doubt about it.
We're guilty as charged.

927
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:16,928
You and I both know that the Cardassians
are a strong people.

928
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:20,974
-They'll survive. Cardassia will survive.
-Oh, please, Doctor.

929
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:25,144
Spare me your insufferable
Federation optimism.

930
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:29,691
Of course, it'll survive...
but not as the Cardassia I knew.

931
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:34,153
We had a rich and ancient culture.

932
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:37,782
Our literature, music,
art was second to none.

933
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:39,534
And now...

934
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:42,370
so much of it is...

935
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:44,038
lost.

936
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:49,252
So many of our best people...

937
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:53,840
our most gifted minds...

938
00:59:57,135 --> 01:00:02,557
-I'm sorry, Garak. I didn't mean...
-Oh, it's... it's quite all right, Doctor.

939
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:11,858
You've been such a good friend.
I'm going to miss our lunches together.

940
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:16,321
-I'm sure we'll see each other again.
-I'd like to think so.

941
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,574
But one can never say.

942
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:24,662
We live in uncertain times.

943
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:51,981
The war between
the Dominion and the Federation Alliance

944
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:53,816
is now over.

945
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:58,863
Four hundred years ago,
a victorious general

946
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:02,283
spoke the following words
at the end of another costly war,

947
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:07,288
"Today the guns are silent.
A great tragedy has ended.

948
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:11,793
We have known the bitterness of defeat
and the exultation of triumph

949
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,756
and from both we have learned
there can be no going back.

950
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:20,927
We must move forward

951
01:01:21,302 --> 01:01:24,097
to preserve in peace
what we've won in war."

952
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:34,982
It's up to you now, Odo.

953
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:45,326
-You're coming to Vic's tonight, right?
-I will be there.

954
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:47,120
But I will not dance.

955
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:48,621
Who's asking?

956
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:50,331
-SISKO: Commander Worf.
-Captain.

957
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,334
-Can you spare a moment?
-WORF: Yes, sir.

958
01:01:53,751 --> 01:01:56,713
We've been discussing
your plans for the future.

959
01:01:58,172 --> 01:02:00,425
I was not aware I had any plans.

960
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:02,760
Commander, how would you feel
about being named

961
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:04,762
Federation Ambassador to Kronos?

962
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:07,432
I am not a diplomat.

963
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:09,934
And I am not a politician

964
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:14,564
but sometimes fate plays
cruel tricks on us, Worf.

965
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:19,318
Come. Kronos needs you.
And what's more, I need you.

966
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:26,033
You helped him become Chancellor.
Can't very well turn your back on him now.

967
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:31,581
Well, my first loyalty is to you, Captain.

968
01:02:31,956 --> 01:02:33,332
Thank you, Mr. Worf.

969
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:37,003
I'll probably regret this in the morning
but, if it's what you want...

970
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:39,380
then by all means.

971
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:46,095
It has been a great honor
serving with you.

972
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:47,972
The honor is mine.

973
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:51,642
I accept.

974
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:53,311
Excellent.

975
01:02:55,646 --> 01:02:58,566
An ambassador
who'll go<i> targ</i> hunting with me.

976
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:04,572
Well... perhaps being Chancellor
won't be so bad after all.

977
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:06,282
Congratulations, Worf.

978
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:13,915
When will you be going?

979
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:16,292
Soon.

980
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:22,131
You could come back, you know...
once you've cured your people.

981
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:25,218
I could.

982
01:03:27,261 --> 01:03:29,013
But you're not going to do that.

983
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:31,808
( sighing ) Nerys...

984
01:03:36,437 --> 01:03:39,774
you know my feelings for you
will never change...

985
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:46,823
but I have to do this. My people need me.

986
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:53,830
They need to know what I know
to learn what I've learned...

987
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:57,166
from living among solids.

988
01:03:59,585 --> 01:04:01,879
It's the only way
they'll ever learn to trust you.

989
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:06,133
You don't have to justify
your decision, Odo.

990
01:04:08,427 --> 01:04:09,679
There's just one thing...

991
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:11,430
Anything.

992
01:04:12,765 --> 01:04:15,685
I'd like to take you
back to your home world.

993
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:19,063
I'd like that.

994
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:22,817
I'd like that very much.

995
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:27,405
Hey... pally.

996
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:29,907
If you're here for another game
of "Go Fish"

997
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:31,367
I'm a little busy right now.

998
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:33,578
Actually, I'm here
for the "End of the war,

999
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:36,080
good-bye to Chief O'Brien, good-bye to Odo

1000
01:04:36,455 --> 01:04:38,332
good-bye to Worf party."

1001
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:39,333
At the bar.

1002
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:43,713
No, seriously, Miles.
You know, I envy you,

1003
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:46,674
going back to Earth...
chance to enjoy paradise again.

1004
01:04:46,757 --> 01:04:48,551
Any idea where you're going to live?

1005
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:52,013
No, Keiko and I are still mulling
over a few possibilities.

1006
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:52,930
Have you ever considered Minsk?

1007
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:54,765
I don't think that's on our list.

1008
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:56,475
New Orleans is a gorgeous city.

1009
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,477
I've heard great things about Paris.

1010
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:00,271
Minsk.

1011
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:02,231
Jadzia loved Rio.

1012
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:04,734
Well, you've certainly
got a lot of choices.

1013
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:06,402
Yeah. Too many, hmm?

1014
01:05:06,527 --> 01:05:07,486
WORF: Minsk.

1015
01:05:07,653 --> 01:05:08,821
Well, wherever you decide to go

1016
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:11,407
I'm sure that you and Keiko
will both be very happy.

1017
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:14,577
Listen, Julian, I know Earth
isn't exactly around the corner

1018
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:17,079
-but I still expect you to visit.
-I intend to.

1019
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:18,080
Yeah.

1020
01:05:18,789 --> 01:05:21,250
You and me, take a little trip to Texas.

1021
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:23,419
Standing side by side
in front of the Alamo.

1022
01:05:23,502 --> 01:05:24,754
The real Alamo, hmm?

1023
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:26,339
See? It's going to be great.

1024
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:27,965
Absolutely.

1025
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:29,508
I don't see how great it would be.

1026
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:32,053
Earth's nothing more than
a rotating ball of boredom.

1027
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:35,973
If you ask me,
you'd be better off staying here.

1028
01:05:36,515 --> 01:05:38,726
And that goes for you and Worf as well.

1029
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:40,603
Don't tell me you're getting
sentimental, Quark.

1030
01:05:40,811 --> 01:05:41,646
Me?

1031
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:43,773
Not a chance.

1032
01:05:44,815 --> 01:05:46,609
I just don't like change.

1033
01:05:47,026 --> 01:05:47,944
You better get used to it.

1034
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:50,821
Things are going to be pretty
different around here now.

1035
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:57,078
To the best crew any Captain ever had.

1036
01:05:57,662 --> 01:06:00,539
This may be the last time
we're all together...

1037
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:06,087
but no matter what the future holds...
no matter how far we travel

1038
01:06:06,545 --> 01:06:10,299
a part of us... a very important part,

1039
01:06:10,424 --> 01:06:14,762
will always remain here...
on Deep Space 9.

1040
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:16,597
Hear, hear! Cheers.

1041
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:23,729
VIC: Ladies and gentlemen,

1042
01:06:24,063 --> 01:06:26,857
tonight is a very special night
for some friends of mine.

1043
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,818

"Nothing lasts forever."

So, gang...

1048
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:39,203

01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:00,905
No!

( slow jazz playing )

1087

Ben, what's wrong?

1088
01:10:17,671 --> 01:10:19,215
I understand now.

1089
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:20,799
Understand what?

1090
01:10:21,592 --> 01:10:27,097
What I have to do. What I was meant to do.
Kasidy, I have to go.

1091
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:28,390
Go where?

1092
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:31,227
-To Bajor, to the fire caves.
-I'll go with you.

1093
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:32,144
No...

1094
01:10:33,979 --> 01:10:35,356
I have to do this alone.

( Dukat laughs )

1096
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:54,166
Did you really think
the Pah-wraiths would choose you

1097
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,001
as their Emissary?

1098
01:10:57,294 --> 01:10:58,837
( laughs )

1099
01:11:01,382 --> 01:11:05,386
Soon the Pah-wraiths
will burn across Bajor...

1100
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:08,472
the Celestial Temple...

1101
01:11:09,598 --> 01:11:13,560
the Alpha Quadrant. Can you picture it?

1102
01:11:13,727 --> 01:11:18,482
An entire universe... set in flames...

1103
01:11:19,566 --> 01:11:22,736
to burn for all eternity.

1104
01:11:26,865 --> 01:11:29,827
The Prophets have sent me a gift.

1105
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:38,752
Their beloved Emissary sent forth
like an avenging angel

1106
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:40,421
to slay the demon.

1107
01:11:40,838 --> 01:11:43,257
I should have known
the demon would be you.

1108
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:47,261
Go on... kill me if you can.

1109
01:11:49,888 --> 01:11:51,890
( Dukat laughing )

1110
01:11:53,225 --> 01:11:55,728
You'll have to do better
than that, Captain.

1111
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:01,066
( Dukat laughs )

1112
01:12:01,525 --> 01:12:03,235
It's just too easy.

1113
01:12:05,195 --> 01:12:08,741
That's it. Come closer. That's it.

1114
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:19,418
Now bow to me.

1115
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:24,423
I said bow.

1116
01:12:30,471 --> 01:12:32,723
( struggling ) You are pathetic.

1117
01:12:32,973 --> 01:12:34,933
Then why are you the one on your knees?

1118
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:38,687
First the Dominion, now the Pah-wraiths.

1119
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:42,232
You have a talent
for picking the losing sides.

1120
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:46,070
Benjamin, please,
we've know each other too long.

1121
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:50,074
And since this is the last time
we will ever be together

1122
01:12:50,157 --> 01:12:52,493
let's try to speak honestly.

1123
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:56,288
We've both had our victories
and our defeats.

1124
01:12:56,747 --> 01:12:59,458
Now it's time to resolve our differences

1125
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:04,463
and face the ultimate truth.
I've won, Benjamin.

1126
01:13:06,173 --> 01:13:07,800
You've lost.

1127
01:13:09,176 --> 01:13:11,804
The Pah-wraiths
will never conquer anything,

1128
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:15,808
not Bajor... not the Celestial Temple

1129
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:19,186
and certainly not the Alpha Quadrant.

1130
01:13:20,604 --> 01:13:22,356
And who's going to stop us?

1131
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:23,565
I am!

1132
01:13:27,694 --> 01:13:29,905
You can't even stand up.

1133
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:33,117
WINN: Then I'll stop you.

1134
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:43,043
Are you still here?

1135
01:13:44,294 --> 01:13:46,422
Emissary, the book!

1136
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:58,684
Farewell, Adami.

1137
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:01,353
( screams )

1138
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:10,904

1139
01:14:13,657 --> 01:14:15,117
( heartbeat thudding )

1140
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:16,076
Sarah?

1141
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:19,455
Are you here?

1142
01:14:21,248 --> 01:14:22,082
What happened?

1143
01:14:23,375 --> 01:14:25,961
The Emissary has completed his task.

1144
01:14:26,044 --> 01:14:27,254
But the Pah-wraiths...

1145
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:31,800
You've returned them to their prison
within the fire caves.

1146
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:34,386
The book was the key, wasn't it?

1147
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:37,473
To a door that can never be opened again.

1148
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:39,808
And Dukat... is he dead?

1149
01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:44,104
He's where he belongs,
with the Pah-wraiths.

1150
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:49,985
Your time of trial has ended.

1151
01:14:51,069 --> 01:14:52,571
You need to rest now.

1152
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:59,203
Oh, I intend to as soon as I return
to Deep Space 9.

1153
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:02,414
That won't be necessary.

1154
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:09,213
You're with us now.

1155
01:15:22,267 --> 01:15:24,895
We found the Captain's runabout
orbiting Bajor.

1156
01:15:25,103 --> 01:15:28,065
But when we scanned the fire caves
there was no sign of him.

1157
01:15:28,148 --> 01:15:29,733
Tarkalian tea. Soothing.

1158
01:15:30,609 --> 01:15:31,818
Better keep it coming.

1159
01:15:32,069 --> 01:15:34,112
You're not calling off
the search yet, are you?

1160
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:36,114
Not until we find your father.

1161
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:41,662
What about the Kendra Province,
where he bought that land?

1162
01:15:42,579 --> 01:15:44,122
Maybe he went there for some reason.

1163
01:15:44,414 --> 01:15:48,544
Colonel Kira and Chief O'Brien
have completed another scan of the planet.

1164
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:51,463
As far as they can tell, he is not there.

1165
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:55,551
Something's happened to Ben...
something bad.

1166
01:15:55,634 --> 01:15:56,718
I can feel it.

1167
01:15:59,096 --> 01:16:00,347
The Prophets warned us.

1168
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:03,976
( whispering voices, heartbeat thudding )

1169
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:05,227
Hello?

1170
01:16:06,853 --> 01:16:08,188
Is anyone here?

1171
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:13,860
Ben? Is that you?

1172
01:16:14,361 --> 01:16:15,279
SISKO: Kasidy...

1173
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:17,656
Oh, Ben.

1174
01:16:20,867 --> 01:16:22,744
Oh, I've been so worried about you.

1175
01:16:25,622 --> 01:16:26,957
Where are we?

1176
01:16:27,457 --> 01:16:29,001
The Celestial Temple.

1177
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:34,298
This is scaring me. Let's go home.

1178
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:38,176
I can't. Not now.

1179
01:16:39,344 --> 01:16:40,262
Why not?

1180
01:16:44,349 --> 01:16:45,601
Oh, God.

1181
01:16:49,104 --> 01:16:51,398
This is it, isn't it?

1182
01:16:55,068 --> 01:16:58,155
The sorrow that the Prophets
warned us about.

1183
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:04,911
It's difficult to explain.

1184
01:17:07,331 --> 01:17:08,206
It's not linear.

1185
01:17:08,957 --> 01:17:10,000
What isn't?

1186
01:17:10,834 --> 01:17:11,835
My life...

1187
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:14,338
my destiny...

1188
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:18,759
The Prophets saved me, Kasidy.

1189
01:17:19,676 --> 01:17:21,345
I'm their Emissary

1190
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:26,350
and they still have a great deal
for me to do.

1191
01:17:27,142 --> 01:17:28,226
But first...

1192
01:17:29,269 --> 01:17:31,313
there is much to learn...

1193
01:17:32,856 --> 01:17:35,525
things only the Prophets can teach me.

1194
01:17:37,069 --> 01:17:38,904
When will you be back?

1195
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:40,864
It's hard to say.

1196
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:45,285
Maybe a year...

1197
01:17:45,369 --> 01:17:46,578
maybe...

1198
01:17:47,579 --> 01:17:48,997
yesterday.

1199
01:17:50,707 --> 01:17:52,167
But I will be back.

1200
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:57,047
And I will be waiting.

1201
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:05,055
Kas, can you hear me?

1202
01:18:08,642 --> 01:18:11,144
You seemed pretty far away for a second.

1203
01:18:13,605 --> 01:18:15,941
I was talking to your father.

1204
01:22:05,086 --> 01:22:07,130
Are you sure you want to leave
without saying good-bye?

1205
01:22:07,255 --> 01:22:09,758
I'm sure.
I've never been good at good-byes.

1206
01:22:10,008 --> 01:22:12,636
There are going to be a lot of people
that are disappointed.

1207
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:14,554
If they don't know
how I feel about them now

1208
01:22:14,679 --> 01:22:16,514
a few parting words
won't make the difference.

1209
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:18,767
Aha! I knew it.

1210
01:22:19,017 --> 01:22:21,519
When I saw the two of you slip out
I said to myself

1211
01:22:21,811 --> 01:22:26,858
"That no-good, misanthropic
cantankerous changeling is trying

1212
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:29,277
to sneak off the station
without anyone noticing."

1213
01:22:29,736 --> 01:22:31,237
That was the idea.

1214
01:22:31,321 --> 01:22:32,739
Well, it's not going to happen, is it?

1215
01:22:32,822 --> 01:22:34,032
Apparently not.

1216
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:36,201
So...

1217
01:22:37,118 --> 01:22:38,828
now that I'm here...

1218
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:44,751
is there something you want to say to me?

1219
01:22:45,335 --> 01:22:46,670
Such as...?

1220
01:22:46,878 --> 01:22:48,797
Such as...

1221
01:22:49,506 --> 01:22:53,176
"Good-bye. You certainly were
a worthy adversary."

1222
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:57,847
Or maybe something
with the words "mutual respect" in it.

1223
01:22:58,598 --> 01:22:59,474
No.

1224
01:22:59,933 --> 01:23:01,851
No? What do you mean, no?

1225
01:23:02,185 --> 01:23:03,353
I mean no.

1226
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:06,314
I have nothing I want to say to you.

1227
01:23:06,523 --> 01:23:07,983
Are you telling me
that after all these years

1228
01:23:08,108 --> 01:23:09,442
after all we've been through

1229
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:11,611
you're not even going
to say good-bye to me?

1230
01:23:12,028 --> 01:23:13,446
That's right.

1231
01:23:15,699 --> 01:23:17,993
Nerys... I'll be on the runabout.

1232
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:20,245
( scoffs )

1233
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:26,876
Don't take it hard, Quark.

1234
01:23:27,127 --> 01:23:27,961
Hard?

1235
01:23:28,878 --> 01:23:31,881
What are you talking about?
That man loves me.

1236
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:36,219
Couldn't you see?
It was written all over his back.

1237
01:24:18,511 --> 01:24:19,304
The Link...

1238
01:24:20,430 --> 01:24:21,306
it's so different.

1239
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:24,517
They're dying.

1240
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:27,020
You should go to them.

1241
01:24:28,521 --> 01:24:29,355
Yes.

1242
01:24:33,151 --> 01:24:33,985
Nerys...

1243
01:24:35,153 --> 01:24:38,073
please, tell everyone I'll miss them.

1244
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:39,741
Even Quark?

1245
01:24:40,825 --> 01:24:41,951
Even Quark.

1246
01:24:44,496 --> 01:24:45,538
But most of all...

1247
01:24:48,708 --> 01:24:49,584
I know.

1248
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:22,242
Odo...

1249
01:25:22,325 --> 01:25:25,120
You always said I looked good in a tuxedo.

1250
01:25:27,413 --> 01:25:28,748
You do.

1251
01:25:29,249 --> 01:25:31,584
Then this is the way
I want you to remember me.

1252
01:25:32,919 --> 01:25:34,712
I'll never forget you.

1253
01:25:41,719 --> 01:25:42,887
Good-bye, Nerys.

1254
01:26:29,976 --> 01:26:31,311
The duty roster, Colonel.

1255
01:26:33,646 --> 01:26:34,564
Nice work.

1256
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:37,817
Congratulations
on your promotion, Lieutenant.

1257
01:26:37,984 --> 01:26:38,985
Thank you, sir.

1258
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:41,863
I guess putting me in for a promotion

1259
01:26:41,946 --> 01:26:45,116
was one of Captain Sisko's
last official acts.

1260
01:26:45,283 --> 01:26:46,784
I'm sure he's very proud of you, Nog.

1261
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:49,871
I'd like to think so, sir.

1262
01:26:50,371 --> 01:26:52,665
Now, about the cargo inventories...

1263
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:55,001
I'll get right on it.

1264
01:27:21,569 --> 01:27:24,030
You know, the thing is,
the apoptosis is really

1265
01:27:24,113 --> 01:27:26,199
just part of the normal
cardiac renewal process.

1266
01:27:26,574 --> 01:27:27,492
What do you think?

1267
01:27:28,451 --> 01:27:30,870
I think that after dinner tonight
we should go to Quark's

1268
01:27:30,954 --> 01:27:32,247
spend some time in the holosuite.

1269
01:27:32,330 --> 01:27:34,165
Oh... I'd like a trip to Vegas.

1270
01:27:34,791 --> 01:27:36,542
Actually, I was thinking about the Alamo.

1271
01:27:37,585 --> 01:27:39,003
-We can't go there.
-Why not?

1272
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:41,130
Because that's what Miles and I... did.

1273
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:44,884
But I do have a new program,
the Battle of Thermopylae.

1274
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:46,094
Do you know it?

1275
01:27:46,594 --> 01:27:49,764
Well, it's about a force of Spartans
led by King Leonidas

1276
01:27:50,014 --> 01:27:53,726
who defend a mountain pass
against a vast army of Persians.

1277
01:27:54,102 --> 01:27:55,270
What happens then?

1278
01:27:55,728 --> 01:27:59,315
Well, for two days
the Spartans lead a heroic struggle.

1279
01:27:59,774 --> 01:28:01,150
Until they're wiped out.

1280
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:02,193
Yes.

1281
01:28:02,443 --> 01:28:03,361
How'd you know?

1282
01:28:03,444 --> 01:28:04,404
Lucky guess.

1283
01:28:04,612 --> 01:28:05,863
I take it we'll be the Spartans.

1284
01:28:05,947 --> 01:28:09,409
-Fighting to the last man.
-Just like the Alamo.

1285
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:10,952
Exactly.

1286
01:28:11,869 --> 01:28:15,957
Have you talked to a Counselor
about these annihilation fantasies?

1287
01:28:16,541 --> 01:28:17,583
Do you think I should?

1288
01:28:17,709 --> 01:28:20,128
Mm-hmm. I'll set up a session
for you tomorrow.

1289
01:28:20,461 --> 01:28:21,462
What about tonight?

1290
01:28:22,088 --> 01:28:23,673
Tonight, we defend the pass.

1291
01:28:25,633 --> 01:28:28,469
Don't worry.
It's guaranteed to grow hair within a week

1292
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:32,015
though if you ask me
that dome of yours is hairy enough.

1293
01:28:32,849 --> 01:28:36,227
Besides, hasn't there been enough change
around here already?

1294
01:28:38,521 --> 01:28:39,689
KIRA: Quark!

1295
01:28:42,275 --> 01:28:44,235
You mind explaining this?

1296
01:28:45,570 --> 01:28:50,241
Oh, uh, that's, um...
this week's betting pool.

1297
01:28:50,450 --> 01:28:52,285
You're taking bets
on who's going to be the new Kai?

1298
01:28:52,869 --> 01:28:54,370
It's a wide open field.

1299
01:28:54,746 --> 01:28:58,791
Just between you and me
the smart money is on Vedek Ungtae.

1300
01:28:58,875 --> 01:29:02,754
Ah... well, just between you and me
all bets are off.

1301
01:29:02,837 --> 01:29:03,755
What are you talking about?

1302
01:29:03,921 --> 01:29:05,798
As of this moment,
betting pools of any kind

1303
01:29:05,882 --> 01:29:07,091
are illegal on this station.

1304
01:29:07,216 --> 01:29:08,885
I catch someone placing a bet

1305
01:29:09,177 --> 01:29:12,638
I put you in a holding cell for 15 days.
Is that clear?

1306
01:29:12,722 --> 01:29:13,765
Fifteen days?

1307
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:15,683
Can I bring my own pillow?

1308
01:29:16,017 --> 01:29:16,851
Quark...

1309
01:29:17,226 --> 01:29:18,811
It's clear, it's clear.

1310
01:29:19,937 --> 01:29:20,772
Better be.

1311
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:35,370
( sighs ) It's like I said,

1312
01:29:35,578 --> 01:29:40,541
the more things change,
the more they stay the same.
