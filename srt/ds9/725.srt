1
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:06,301
The time is 0500.

2
00:00:06,337 --> 00:00:08,330
Mmm... yeah, all right...

3
00:00:11,047 --> 00:00:12,447
Julian?

4
00:00:12,483 --> 00:00:13,610
Yes.

5
00:00:13,653 --> 00:00:15,486
We have to get up.

6
00:00:15,523 --> 00:00:17,493
Yeah, sure.

7
00:00:17,527 --> 00:00:19,861
It's a big day.

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,002
It was a big night.

9
00:00:27,413 --> 00:00:30,544
Cleared up a lot
of unanswered questions.

10
00:00:30,586 --> 00:00:32,180
Such as?

11
00:00:32,222 --> 00:00:38,224
Such as just how far
these spots really go down.

12
00:00:38,335 --> 00:00:40,532
I suppose you'll
want to tell Miles.

13
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:42,941
Now why would I want to do that?

14
00:00:42,977 --> 00:00:45,470
Because you tell him
everything.

15
00:00:45,515 --> 00:00:47,006
True.

16
00:00:47,052 --> 00:00:48,749
But you know what?

17
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:50,315
In this case...

18
00:00:52,296 --> 00:00:54,163
I'm going to make an exception.

19
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,432
Good.

20
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,744
Mmm... we really should get up.

21
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,909
We don't want the <i>Defiant</i>
leaving without us.

22
00:01:02,951 --> 00:01:04,545
You know, I've never
been into battle

23
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:06,217
with someone
I've slept with before.

24
00:01:07,961 --> 00:01:10,431
Well, there's a first time
for everything.

25
00:01:10,465 --> 00:01:13,369
Now that we're finally together

26
00:01:13,405 --> 00:01:16,434
it'd be such a shame if
something happened to one of us.

27
00:01:18,381 --> 00:01:20,180
Let's make a pact.

28
00:01:20,218 --> 00:01:21,983
We both come home alive.

29
00:01:22,022 --> 00:01:23,958
You got yourself a deal.

30
00:01:25,529 --> 00:01:27,522
I'm holding you to that.

31
00:01:34,681 --> 00:01:37,278
Oh, and don't forget,
Kirayoshi has his checkup

32
00:01:37,386 --> 00:01:38,615
at 0900 tomorrow.

33
00:01:38,656 --> 00:01:40,592
I've already confirmed the
appointment with Nurse Bandee.

34
00:01:40,626 --> 00:01:41,753
Come on, sweetie, one more bite.

35
00:01:41,795 --> 00:01:43,890
And don't stay up all night
writing that paper on...

36
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:45,265
W-what are those trees called?

37
00:01:45,302 --> 00:01:46,292
Arfillian Ficus.

38
00:01:46,404 --> 00:01:47,872
And they're not trees,
they're shrubs.

39
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:49,307
Yeah, well...
try to get some sleep.

40
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:50,309
Oh, and...

41
00:01:50,378 --> 00:01:51,311
Honey...

42
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,313
we'll be fine.

43
00:01:52,382 --> 00:01:53,315
Stop worrying.

44
00:01:53,418 --> 00:01:54,351
Right.

45
00:01:55,355 --> 00:01:56,345
Molly...

46
00:01:57,593 --> 00:01:59,324
please don't touch that.

47
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,263
I let you play with my toys.

48
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,702
Yeah, but, see,
this isn't a toy.

49
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:06,005
This is a... model.

50
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:08,343
Maybe it belongs
in a museum then.

51
00:02:12,222 --> 00:02:14,249
I suppose I could
give it to Julian.

52
00:02:14,293 --> 00:02:16,024
Sounds good to me.

53
00:02:16,063 --> 00:02:17,726
Speaking of Julian

54
00:02:17,767 --> 00:02:20,067
have you told him about
Starfleet's offer yet?

55
00:02:20,105 --> 00:02:22,633
Uh... no, not yet.

56
00:02:22,677 --> 00:02:24,168
I knew it.

57
00:02:24,213 --> 00:02:25,807
What's that supposed to mean?

58
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,513
We're not going back to Earth.

59
00:02:27,553 --> 00:02:28,919
Of course we are.

60
00:02:28,956 --> 00:02:31,826
Daddy's going to teach
at the Academy...

61
00:02:31,862 --> 00:02:33,228
when the war's over.

62
00:02:33,264 --> 00:02:35,734
Then why haven't
you told Julian?

63
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:38,263
"Out of the mouth of babes."

64
00:02:39,945 --> 00:02:42,245
I'll tell him,
you know... when...

65
00:02:42,282 --> 00:02:43,876
I think he's ready to hear it.

66
00:02:45,455 --> 00:02:46,981
How's that?

67
00:02:47,025 --> 00:02:49,188
Oh, it's doing
wonders for my head

68
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:51,860
but it's my stomach
that's bothering me.

69
00:02:51,902 --> 00:02:54,168
If it will help,
morning sickness ends

70
00:02:54,206 --> 00:02:55,800
after the first trimester.

71
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:57,369
Oh, that's two more months.

72
00:02:57,412 --> 00:02:59,075
I don't think
I'm going to make it.

73
00:02:59,116 --> 00:03:00,915
You're going to make it.

74
00:03:00,953 --> 00:03:02,479
Ben?

75
00:03:02,522 --> 00:03:03,683
Hmm?

76
00:03:05,028 --> 00:03:06,759
Promise me something.

77
00:03:09,036 --> 00:03:11,906
Promise that you'll
come home to us.

78
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,673
I promise.

79
00:03:15,215 --> 00:03:17,276
I don't believe it.

80
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:19,312
I said I promise.

81
00:03:19,356 --> 00:03:20,688
No, it's not...

82
00:03:24,801 --> 00:03:25,928
Come in.

83
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:30,902
Hey... I thought I'd walk you
to the <i>Defiant.</i>

84
00:03:30,946 --> 00:03:32,575
I'd like that.

85
00:03:34,153 --> 00:03:35,553
Ah.

86
00:03:35,588 --> 00:03:36,556
How's Kas?

87
00:03:38,661 --> 00:03:42,761
Reports of my death
have been exaggerated...

88
00:03:42,804 --> 00:03:44,933
but not by much.

89
00:03:46,812 --> 00:03:48,280
Isn't there something
she can take

90
00:03:48,314 --> 00:03:49,373
to make her feel better?

91
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,318
She doesn't like
taking medication

92
00:03:51,353 --> 00:03:52,947
unless it's
absolutely necessary.

93
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:56,425
Sounds necessary to me.

94
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,400
Waiting for you to leave
only makes me feel worse.

95
00:03:59,436 --> 00:04:00,962
If you're going to go, just go.

96
00:04:05,115 --> 00:04:07,951
Are you sure I can't
get you anything?

97
00:04:09,056 --> 00:04:11,526
Just hurry up
and come back home.

98
00:04:16,872 --> 00:04:19,138
Mind if I walk with you,
Commander?

99
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,405
Not at all.

100
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:21,639
Captain Sisko informed me

101
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,616
that you would be joining
us on the mission.

102
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:26,087
I hope that when we
reach Cardassia

103
00:04:26,123 --> 00:04:28,686
we find Colonel Kira
alive and well.

104
00:04:28,728 --> 00:04:30,561
So do I, Commander.

105
00:04:30,598 --> 00:04:31,861
So do I.

106
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:39,276
Captain on the Bridge.

107
00:04:40,853 --> 00:04:42,116
All right, people.

108
00:04:42,155 --> 00:04:44,182
What do you say we end this war?

109
00:04:44,226 --> 00:04:45,455
Sounds good to me.

110
00:04:45,528 --> 00:04:48,364
Ensign, I believe you know
the way to Cardassia.

111
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:51,396
If I get lost, I'll just
follow the ship in front of us.

112
00:06:58,934 --> 00:07:02,465
The Federation invasion fleet
has left Deep Space 9.

113
00:07:02,508 --> 00:07:06,448
They'll reach the Cardassian
border by tomorrow night.

114
00:07:07,952 --> 00:07:11,413
Our brave Jem'Hadar soldiers
have a motto:

115
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:14,090
"Victory is life."

116
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,562
I'm glad you're familiar with it

117
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:21,840
because today those words
have meaning for us all.

118
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:24,008
The outcome of this
battle will determine

119
00:07:24,051 --> 00:07:26,078
the outcome of the war.

120
00:07:26,122 --> 00:07:28,855
Either we destroy
their invasion forces

121
00:07:28,893 --> 00:07:30,692
or they destroy us.

122
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,359
There is no other option.

123
00:07:34,905 --> 00:07:36,898
Fight well today...

124
00:07:36,943 --> 00:07:40,713
and Romulus will be yours
to do with as you wish.

125
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,317
Yes, yes.

126
00:07:44,358 --> 00:07:46,260
And Earth, too.

127
00:07:49,301 --> 00:07:51,294
I assure you...

128
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:53,366
the pleasure is all mine.

129
00:08:01,225 --> 00:08:04,061
Is something bothering you?

130
00:08:06,035 --> 00:08:08,403
Apparently, uh...

131
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:10,932
I was under
the mistaken impression

132
00:08:10,977 --> 00:08:12,742
that all Federation territories

133
00:08:12,781 --> 00:08:14,978
would fall
under my jurisdiction...

134
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,990
including Earth.

135
00:08:17,024 --> 00:08:19,051
And so they shall.

136
00:08:20,363 --> 00:08:21,626
But...

137
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:24,570
you promised the Breen.

138
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:27,771
I would promise the Breen
the entire Alpha Quadrant

139
00:08:27,811 --> 00:08:30,281
if I thought it would help
win this war.

140
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:36,621
The Founder is wise
in all things.

141
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:42,506
Founder...

142
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:46,106
I've heard a disturbing rumor
about the traitor Damar.

143
00:08:46,148 --> 00:08:47,777
What about him?

144
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,685
He may be alive.

145
00:08:49,722 --> 00:08:51,783
Is this possible?

146
00:08:51,826 --> 00:08:53,420
I don't see how.

147
00:08:53,463 --> 00:08:55,524
We destroyed his ship,
his rebel bases...

148
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:57,058
But his body was never found.

149
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:58,664
They say he's here...

150
00:08:58,706 --> 00:09:00,174
on Cardassia Prime.

151
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:02,112
In the capital, no less.

152
00:09:02,147 --> 00:09:03,912
Look into this matter.

153
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,011
If Damar is alive...

154
00:09:07,357 --> 00:09:10,352
He won't be for long.

155
00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:29,826
Halt!

156
00:09:29,868 --> 00:09:31,428
Step forward...

157
00:09:31,472 --> 00:09:32,872
slowly.

158
00:09:32,908 --> 00:09:34,137
I'm sorry, have we done
something wrong?

159
00:09:34,178 --> 00:09:36,741
We're new to the city
and I'm afraid we're lost.

160
00:09:36,782 --> 00:09:38,775
Quiet!

161
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,790
You are Legate Damar.

162
00:09:40,824 --> 00:09:42,315
I told you...
you look just like him.

163
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,989
I can't tell you
how many times

164
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,000
my cousin has been
mistaken for that traitor.

165
00:09:46,034 --> 00:09:48,870
He will be taken
to Dominion headquarters.

166
00:09:48,906 --> 00:09:51,240
You will die here.

167
00:09:53,783 --> 00:09:55,810
I do not understand you.

168
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,104
I don't mean to sound
ungrateful, but...

169
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,007
what are you doing here?

170
00:10:07,042 --> 00:10:08,671
Watching your backs.

171
00:10:08,713 --> 00:10:10,376
I thought we decided
it would be safer

172
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:11,782
if you stayed out of sight.

173
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,482
Well, that's
what the helmet's for.

174
00:10:13,523 --> 00:10:15,083
You should be wearing one, too.

175
00:10:15,126 --> 00:10:16,720
Every Jem'Hadar
and Breen soldier

176
00:10:16,762 --> 00:10:18,253
on Cardassia's looking for you.

177
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:19,392
If I'm to lead this revolt

178
00:10:19,434 --> 00:10:20,868
I can't do it
hiding in a cellar.

179
00:10:20,904 --> 00:10:23,306
It was necessary for me to
attend that gathering tonight.

180
00:10:23,409 --> 00:10:26,848
Well, fill me in later.

181
00:10:26,882 --> 00:10:29,581
If anyone stops us,
you're my prisoners.

182
00:10:32,126 --> 00:10:34,187
But the vote was unanimous.

183
00:10:34,231 --> 00:10:36,428
The work disruptions
begin tomorrow.

184
00:10:36,468 --> 00:10:38,563
Power, communication and
transportation facilities

185
00:10:38,606 --> 00:10:40,576
throughout Cardassia
will be sabotaged.

186
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:43,343
The Dominion fleet will be
cut off from all ground support.

187
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,979
That way, they'll have to face
the invasion force on their own.

188
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,853
And once the Dominion
is crushed...

189
00:10:47,891 --> 00:10:50,488
All Cardassia
will be free again.

190
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,500
Oh, when you were a small boy

191
00:10:52,534 --> 00:10:54,970
I was worried about you.

192
00:10:55,005 --> 00:10:57,134
Always getting into trouble.

193
00:10:57,177 --> 00:10:59,147
So secretive

194
00:10:59,181 --> 00:11:01,378
so full of deceit.

195
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:05,085
Who would've thought those
disgraceful characteristics

196
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,527
would be turned to virtues.

197
00:11:07,564 --> 00:11:09,534
More tea?

198
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:11,663
You're too kind.

199
00:11:22,294 --> 00:11:23,820
Do you hear that, Chief?

200
00:11:25,566 --> 00:11:28,629
Sounds like the Doppler
compensators are out of phase.

201
00:11:28,673 --> 00:11:30,643
Ensign, how's she handling?

202
00:11:30,677 --> 00:11:33,240
She's not quite as smooth
as the old <i>Defiant,</i> sir.

203
00:11:33,282 --> 00:11:35,115
Feels a bit sluggish.

204
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,313
Chief?

205
00:11:36,355 --> 00:11:38,154
I'm on it.
O'Brien to Engineering.

206
00:11:38,191 --> 00:11:39,284
Engineering.

207
00:11:39,328 --> 00:11:40,888
Recalibrate
the inertial dampers

208
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,866
and check the plasma
flow regulators

209
00:11:42,901 --> 00:11:43,960
while you're at it.

210
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:45,096
Right away, Chief.

211
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:46,367
You think
someone would've come up

212
00:11:46,408 --> 00:11:47,842
with a better
inertial control system.

213
00:11:47,877 --> 00:11:49,004
What's that, Miles?

214
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:54,519
I said I wish you'd wipe
that grin off your face.

215
00:11:54,558 --> 00:11:57,428
You're not the first person
to fall in love, you know.

216
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,329
I thought you'd be happy for me.

217
00:11:59,368 --> 00:12:01,167
I am happy for you.

218
00:12:02,607 --> 00:12:03,768
O'Brien to Engineering.

219
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:04,868
Engineering.

220
00:12:04,911 --> 00:12:06,505
Now try realigning
the induction coils.

221
00:12:06,548 --> 00:12:07,846
Will do.

222
00:12:10,088 --> 00:12:12,058
You're sure you're not angry.

223
00:12:12,092 --> 00:12:14,324
Why should I be angry?

224
00:12:14,364 --> 00:12:16,596
I have been asking you
to tell the doctor

225
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:18,935
how you feel about him
for the past month.

226
00:12:18,973 --> 00:12:21,843
Well... now that
he knows how I feel...

227
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:24,407
I am happy for you.

228
00:12:24,484 --> 00:12:26,681
That's a relief.

229
00:12:26,722 --> 00:12:30,287
But... I am going to kill him.

230
00:12:31,498 --> 00:12:32,796
You're kidding, right?

231
00:12:34,604 --> 00:12:37,337
And Jadzia said I did not
have a sense of humor.

232
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:42,417
Julian, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

233
00:12:42,457 --> 00:12:44,484
You're getting pressure
from Keiko, aren't you?

234
00:12:44,527 --> 00:12:45,927
How did you know?

235
00:12:45,963 --> 00:12:47,933
It's a big decision.

236
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,664
I'm surprised
it didn't come up sooner.

237
00:12:49,704 --> 00:12:51,104
Actually

238
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,973
we've been talking about it
for quite a while.

239
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,877
Well, you can stop
talking about it.

240
00:12:54,914 --> 00:12:56,907
We'll move the Alamo
into my quarters.

241
00:12:56,952 --> 00:12:58,284
I could still use

242
00:12:58,322 --> 00:13:00,588
a little more equalization
on the torque buffers.

243
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:02,493
Uh, right.

244
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,696
I'll try to compensate with
the impulse response filters.

245
00:13:05,736 --> 00:13:07,365
That way, your quarters
won't be so cluttered

246
00:13:07,406 --> 00:13:09,740
and, uh, you can still
use it whenever you want.

247
00:13:09,777 --> 00:13:13,376
I wasn't talking
about the Alamo model.

248
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,752
Besides, it's too big
for your quarters.

249
00:13:15,856 --> 00:13:17,723
You let me worry about that.

250
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,060
So... what were
you talking about?

251
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:23,764
Oh, it's nothing
that can't wait.

252
00:13:23,872 --> 00:13:25,774
Is that any better, Nog?

253
00:13:25,876 --> 00:13:28,005
Torque buffers are stable.

254
00:13:28,047 --> 00:13:30,449
I wish she were here, too,
Constable.

255
00:13:33,592 --> 00:13:36,894
If we only knew
where Kira was.

256
00:13:36,932 --> 00:13:38,902
If we could only be sure
that she was all right.

257
00:13:38,936 --> 00:13:40,565
The Colonel's a survivor.

258
00:13:45,081 --> 00:13:47,712
This war, Captain...

259
00:13:47,753 --> 00:13:49,279
it has to end.

260
00:13:49,323 --> 00:13:51,816
And it will... soon.

261
00:13:51,861 --> 00:13:53,990
One way or the other.

262
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:57,100
Mother?

263
00:13:57,138 --> 00:14:00,599
The Emissary's task
is nearing completion.

264
00:14:00,646 --> 00:14:02,912
Are you talking about the war?

265
00:14:04,854 --> 00:14:06,345
You have walked the path

266
00:14:06,391 --> 00:14:08,793
the Prophets laid out
for you, Benjamin.

267
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,799
Do not falter now.

268
00:14:11,835 --> 00:14:13,964
I don't intend to.

269
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:23,083
Know this... my son.

270
00:14:23,124 --> 00:14:28,157
Your journey's end
lies not before you...

271
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,363
but behind you.

272
00:14:35,014 --> 00:14:36,448
Captain?

273
00:14:36,484 --> 00:14:38,317
Captain...

274
00:14:38,354 --> 00:14:40,381
The Prophets...

275
00:14:40,426 --> 00:14:42,521
came to me in a vision.

276
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:47,396
I take it they weren't
bringing good news.

277
00:14:48,475 --> 00:14:50,377
I'm not sure.

278
00:14:50,412 --> 00:14:52,575
Only time will tell.

279
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,011
Hello, Adami.

280
00:15:07,045 --> 00:15:08,912
You're back.

281
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,922
Is that all
you have to say to me?

282
00:15:17,298 --> 00:15:20,168
I see the Pah-wraiths
have restored your sight.

283
00:15:20,204 --> 00:15:22,436
Yes, they've forgiven me.

284
00:15:22,476 --> 00:15:27,077
I was hoping you could find it
in your heart to do the same.

285
00:15:27,118 --> 00:15:29,715
I don't forgive war criminals.

286
00:15:31,995 --> 00:15:35,490
To think I took Gul Dukat
to my bed...

287
00:15:35,536 --> 00:15:39,840
one of the most hated men
in Bajoran history.

288
00:15:39,877 --> 00:15:42,678
I've already told you
how much I regret my actions

289
00:15:42,716 --> 00:15:44,811
during the occupation.

290
00:15:44,854 --> 00:15:46,847
Of course you do.

291
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:55,370
Have you learned how to release
the Pah-wraiths?

292
00:15:55,408 --> 00:16:00,943
The secrets of the <i>Kosst Amojan</i>
have been revealed to me, yes.

293
00:16:01,053 --> 00:16:04,993
Then why haven't you gone to
the fire caves and freed them?

294
00:16:05,027 --> 00:16:07,122
I was waiting for you.

295
00:16:10,004 --> 00:16:11,997
Then you do forgive me.

296
00:16:14,881 --> 00:16:16,510
I need your help, Dukat.

297
00:16:16,551 --> 00:16:18,145
It's as simple as that.

298
00:16:20,057 --> 00:16:22,152
All you have to do is ask.

299
00:16:22,195 --> 00:16:25,099
Together, we will release
the Pah-wraiths

300
00:16:25,134 --> 00:16:28,504
so they can lay claim
to the Celestial Temple

301
00:16:28,542 --> 00:16:30,444
and destroy the Prophets.

302
00:16:30,478 --> 00:16:32,846
And their Emissary.

303
00:16:32,883 --> 00:16:34,546
No, no, no.

304
00:16:35,722 --> 00:16:39,287
Benjamin Sisko will be
dealt with by me...

305
00:16:39,329 --> 00:16:41,231
and me alone.

306
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:44,466
Assuming he survives
the invasion of Cardassia.

307
00:16:44,507 --> 00:16:47,172
Oh, he'll survive...

308
00:16:47,211 --> 00:16:48,611
but I promise you...

309
00:16:50,084 --> 00:16:52,316
he'll wish he hadn't.

310
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:05,712
You going to sit
there all night, Quark?

311
00:17:05,749 --> 00:17:09,153
Got any... threes?

312
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:10,852
Go fish.

313
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,837
Don't tell me you're quitting?

314
00:17:16,871 --> 00:17:18,500
It's just not my game.

315
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:20,738
Well, you want
to try pinochle again?

316
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:21,906
How about rummy?

317
00:17:21,948 --> 00:17:23,075
Or gin rummy?

318
00:17:23,117 --> 00:17:24,244
Five card stud?

319
00:17:24,285 --> 00:17:26,084
Uh, canasta?

320
00:17:26,123 --> 00:17:27,489
How about some <i>tongo?</i>

321
00:17:27,525 --> 00:17:30,292
Did they play <i>tongo</i>
in Las Vegas in 1962?

322
00:17:30,331 --> 00:17:31,356
How could they?

323
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,766
It's a Ferengi game.

324
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:35,171
Which is why
my holographic program

325
00:17:35,207 --> 00:17:36,334
can't create it.

326
00:17:36,376 --> 00:17:37,503
I know, I know.

327
00:17:37,545 --> 00:17:39,879
This place is period specific.

328
00:17:41,219 --> 00:17:44,521
For a hologram, you're
not very accommodating.

329
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,360
Oh, is that why you
dropped by... to insult me?

330
00:17:47,398 --> 00:17:50,268
I dropped by because
I had nothing else to do.

331
00:17:50,304 --> 00:17:53,367
My bar hasn't had
half a dozen customers all day.

332
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,938
Everyone's off fighting
this stupid war.

333
00:17:58,855 --> 00:18:00,791
It's not easy
staying behind, is it...

334
00:18:00,826 --> 00:18:02,659
knowing your friends
are out there

335
00:18:02,696 --> 00:18:03,857
risking their lives?

336
00:18:05,468 --> 00:18:07,335
They think they have it rough?

337
00:18:07,371 --> 00:18:10,172
They should try leading
my life for a day.

338
00:18:10,211 --> 00:18:13,513
The hospitality industry
isn't for the fainthearted.

339
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,884
A bartender's life
is a lonely one.

340
00:18:15,922 --> 00:18:19,019
That's true, but few
people understand it.

341
00:18:19,062 --> 00:18:21,032
They think it's
one big happy party.

342
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:22,660
They forget that the person
giving the party

343
00:18:22,703 --> 00:18:23,966
never has any fun.

344
00:18:24,005 --> 00:18:27,570
He's too busy making sure
everyone else is having fun.

345
00:18:27,613 --> 00:18:31,883
All I do, all day long,
is give, give, give.

346
00:18:31,921 --> 00:18:34,391
Bartending is
a very noble profession

347
00:18:34,425 --> 00:18:35,757
and you do it well...

348
00:18:35,796 --> 00:18:38,359
under some very
difficult circumstances

349
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,527
I might add.

350
00:18:39,569 --> 00:18:40,969
You should be proud.

351
00:18:41,006 --> 00:18:42,304
Think so?

352
00:18:42,341 --> 00:18:44,368
I know so, pally.

353
00:18:45,949 --> 00:18:48,010
I just hope Nog...

354
00:18:48,053 --> 00:18:50,455
and the rest
of those heroic idiots

355
00:18:50,491 --> 00:18:51,925
come back in one piece.

356
00:18:51,961 --> 00:18:53,760
There you are.

357
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:56,098
Vic, sweetie, are you ready?

358
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:58,801
Jimmy and Peter
are about to go on.

359
00:18:58,842 --> 00:19:00,744
Sorry, pally, got to run.

360
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:03,045
Durante and Lawford
are at the Sands.

361
00:19:03,116 --> 00:19:04,516
Can't miss that.

362
00:19:04,552 --> 00:19:08,253
I thought you said a bartender's
life was a lonely one.

363
00:19:08,293 --> 00:19:09,591
It is

364
00:19:09,629 --> 00:19:11,097
but I'm not a bartender.

365
00:19:18,313 --> 00:19:19,804
Huh.

366
00:19:21,821 --> 00:19:23,484
Go fish.

367
00:19:40,161 --> 00:19:44,865
Is it really necessary
to rest so often?

368
00:19:44,971 --> 00:19:47,271
You don't need to wait for me.

369
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:48,607
Go on ahead.

370
00:19:48,644 --> 00:19:51,241
Wander aimlessly
through these caves

371
00:19:51,283 --> 00:19:53,948
for the rest
of your miserable life.

372
00:19:55,793 --> 00:19:58,127
I'm in no hurry.

373
00:20:01,303 --> 00:20:03,273
During the occupation

374
00:20:03,307 --> 00:20:10,277
my people found the Bajorans'
fear of these caves amusing...

375
00:20:10,321 --> 00:20:14,455
and yet, we never took
the time to visit them...

376
00:20:14,496 --> 00:20:16,762
and now here I am.

377
00:20:16,802 --> 00:20:19,774
It's ironic, isn't it?

378
00:20:19,808 --> 00:20:21,801
I don't care.

379
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,050
Excuse me, I just meant...

380
00:20:25,084 --> 00:20:27,920
I'm sure you have
many interesting anecdotes

381
00:20:27,957 --> 00:20:29,357
about the occupation

382
00:20:29,393 --> 00:20:32,297
but I don't have any desire
to hear them.

383
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:35,133
I meant no disrespect, Adami.

384
00:20:35,171 --> 00:20:38,302
And stop calling me "Adami."

385
00:20:38,344 --> 00:20:40,814
That privilege
is no longer yours.

386
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:45,154
How should I address you, then?

387
00:20:45,191 --> 00:20:48,561
From now on, you will address me
as "Eminence."

388
00:20:48,598 --> 00:20:49,964
Is that clear?

389
00:20:51,737 --> 00:20:53,502
Perfectly...

390
00:20:58,251 --> 00:21:00,016
Eminence.

391
00:21:06,801 --> 00:21:08,498
I see your point

392
00:21:08,538 --> 00:21:12,137
but for two millennia,
the Jem'Hadar have been

393
00:21:12,178 --> 00:21:15,116
the Dominion's
first line of defense.

394
00:21:15,151 --> 00:21:17,314
It would damage their morale

395
00:21:17,355 --> 00:21:19,416
to have to take a backseat
to the Breen.

396
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,198
Very well.

397
00:21:23,234 --> 00:21:25,466
In the spirit
of our new alliance

398
00:21:25,505 --> 00:21:27,372
I will inform the Jem'Hadar

399
00:21:27,409 --> 00:21:30,745
that the Breen forces will stand
alongside them.

400
00:21:32,586 --> 00:21:34,988
I'm glad that pleases you.

401
00:21:35,024 --> 00:21:36,789
I think we have a problem.

402
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:43,433
Our lines are spread too thin,
especially here, at the center.

403
00:21:43,474 --> 00:21:46,605
We need to dispatch
reinforcements immediately.

404
00:21:46,647 --> 00:21:48,276
Do you agree?

405
00:21:49,753 --> 00:21:52,053
Notify the Jem'Hadar.

406
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:55,461
Order them to reinforce
the center of their lines.

407
00:21:57,235 --> 00:21:58,795
Now what?

408
00:22:00,943 --> 00:22:02,970
Emergency power engaged.

409
00:22:05,886 --> 00:22:07,515
Founder...

410
00:22:07,555 --> 00:22:09,115
I'm relieved to see
that you're all right.

411
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:12,256
Long-range communications
are down.

412
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:14,234
I can't contact the Jem'Hadar.

413
00:22:15,605 --> 00:22:17,302
Of course I'll keep trying.

414
00:22:17,342 --> 00:22:18,936
What caused the power failure?

415
00:22:18,979 --> 00:22:20,676
I'm afraid it was sabotage.

416
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:22,878
Almost every
Dominion installation

417
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,186
on Cardassian Prime
has suffered damage.

418
00:22:25,224 --> 00:22:27,160
Damar.

419
00:22:27,195 --> 00:22:30,167
We captured some
of the terrorists

420
00:22:30,201 --> 00:22:32,330
but they're not soldiers...

421
00:22:32,372 --> 00:22:35,276
they're ordinary citizens.

422
00:22:35,311 --> 00:22:36,779
Are you telling me

423
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:40,082
that the Cardassian people
are rising up against us?

424
00:22:40,154 --> 00:22:43,092
I'm sure it's only a small
number of malcontents.

425
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,893
But we have no way
of knowing that, do we?

426
00:22:45,933 --> 00:22:49,099
Founder,
may I make a suggestion?

427
00:22:49,139 --> 00:22:51,609
Yes, I am sure that
Broca will be very happy

428
00:22:51,643 --> 00:22:53,272
to hear what you have to say.

429
00:22:53,314 --> 00:22:54,714
If the Cardassian people

430
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,688
are responsible
for these acts of terrorism...

431
00:22:57,722 --> 00:23:01,321
if Damar and his fanatics
have turned them against us

432
00:23:01,363 --> 00:23:04,928
then it's the people
who should be punished.

433
00:23:04,971 --> 00:23:07,407
Now, what do you say to that?

434
00:23:07,442 --> 00:23:09,776
Severely punished.

435
00:23:09,813 --> 00:23:13,252
Well, I'm glad we all agree.

436
00:23:13,287 --> 00:23:14,778
See to it.

437
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,576
It's been 24 minutes.

438
00:23:29,619 --> 00:23:30,587
Not bad.

439
00:23:30,621 --> 00:23:32,215
If the Dominion hasn't been able

440
00:23:32,258 --> 00:23:33,818
to restore power to the capital

441
00:23:33,861 --> 00:23:36,331
then the entire planet
must be in chaos.

442
00:23:36,366 --> 00:23:37,664
I hope so.

443
00:23:37,702 --> 00:23:40,902
I'm afraid I was only able
to find two more lightsticks.

444
00:23:40,943 --> 00:23:42,674
There's more about the house
somewhere, but I...

445
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:45,309
Would you stop dawdling
and give them to me?

446
00:23:45,351 --> 00:23:47,787
Oh, well, I remember
that tone of voice.

447
00:23:47,822 --> 00:23:49,290
It reminds me of the demanding

448
00:23:49,326 --> 00:23:51,728
and inconsiderate boy
you used to be.

449
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,596
I haven't changed much, have I?

450
00:23:53,634 --> 00:23:56,162
This will send a clear message
to the Dominion...

451
00:23:56,273 --> 00:23:59,177
the Cardassian people will fight
to regain their freedom.

452
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,181
I hope they realize
their fight is just beginning.

453
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,879
We're going to have
to hit the enemy again

454
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:03,909
and harder this time.

455
00:24:03,955 --> 00:24:05,218
Well, that won't be easy.

456
00:24:05,258 --> 00:24:07,057
They will have tightened
their security.

457
00:24:07,095 --> 00:24:08,393
Well, that doesn't matter.

458
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:09,796
We can't lose our momentum.

459
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:11,735
The Commander is right.

460
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:14,833
We cannot rest
until Cardassia is free.

461
00:24:16,213 --> 00:24:19,744
And when it is, we'll
have you to thank for it.

462
00:24:19,786 --> 00:24:24,056
Without you, this rebellion
would have died in its infancy.

463
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:27,124
Ironic, isn't it...
the savior of Cardassia

464
00:24:27,168 --> 00:24:29,161
a former Bajoran terrorist?

465
00:24:29,205 --> 00:24:31,141
Well, don't canonize me
just yet.

466
00:24:33,714 --> 00:24:35,547
It's been 26 and a half minutes.

467
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:38,054
Let's see what the Dominion
has to say for itself.

468
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:42,759
Citizens of Cardassia,
this latest wave of vandalism

469
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,864
directed against
your Dominion allies must stop.

470
00:24:46,907 --> 00:24:48,068
I wouldn't count on it.

471
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:50,707
We know that these
disgraceful acts of sabotage

472
00:24:50,748 --> 00:24:53,879
were carried out
by a mere handful of extremists

473
00:24:53,921 --> 00:24:56,484
but these radicals
must come to realize

474
00:24:56,526 --> 00:24:59,828
that their disobedience
will not be tolerated.

475
00:24:59,866 --> 00:25:05,002
That you, the Cardassian people,
will suffer the consequences

476
00:25:05,044 --> 00:25:07,880
of their cowardly actions.

477
00:25:07,915 --> 00:25:13,187
Which is why I must inform you,
a few moments ago

478
00:25:13,227 --> 00:25:19,194
Dominion troops
reduced Lakarian City to ashes.

479
00:25:19,305 --> 00:25:21,936
There were no survivors.

480
00:25:21,977 --> 00:25:26,578
Two million men, women
and children

481
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:29,922
gone in a matter of moments.

482
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:33,193
For each act of sabotage
committed against the Dominion

483
00:25:33,233 --> 00:25:36,694
another Cardassian city
will be destroyed.

484
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,644
I implore you
not to let that happen.

485
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,519
Let us return to the spirit
of friendship and cooperation

486
00:25:44,556 --> 00:25:46,185
between our peoples

487
00:25:46,226 --> 00:25:50,530
so that together, we can destroy
our common enemies...

488
00:25:50,568 --> 00:25:53,904
the Federation, the Klingons,
the Romulans

489
00:25:53,941 --> 00:25:56,434
and all the others
that stand against us.

490
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,077
Thank you.

491
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:00,918
I should have killed

492
00:26:00,955 --> 00:26:02,891
that Vorta jackal
when I had the chance.

493
00:26:02,925 --> 00:26:04,416
You want another one?

494
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:06,432
We'll attack
Dominion Headquarters.

495
00:26:06,466 --> 00:26:08,834
Chop off a snake's head
and the body will die.

496
00:26:08,871 --> 00:26:10,237
Exactly.

497
00:26:10,341 --> 00:26:11,434
Damar, for the past two years

498
00:26:11,476 --> 00:26:13,537
you've practically lived
in that building.

499
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,573
If you're asking me
if I know a way in

500
00:26:15,618 --> 00:26:16,586
the answer is no...

501
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,421
not without a valid
security protocol.

502
00:26:19,459 --> 00:26:20,825
All right, we'll use force.

503
00:26:20,861 --> 00:26:22,990
We're going to need
some kind of explosives.

504
00:26:23,032 --> 00:26:24,000
I'll get right on it.

505
00:26:24,034 --> 00:26:26,163
What you're proposing
is suicide.

506
00:26:26,206 --> 00:26:29,235
If you have nothing positive
to say, Mila...

507
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,647
All right,
I'll prepare some food.

508
00:26:31,683 --> 00:26:34,153
Nobody should die
on an empty stomach.

509
00:26:37,945 --> 00:26:39,574
Sir, Chancellor Martok

510
00:26:39,616 --> 00:26:41,643
would like to speak to you
and Admiral Ross.

511
00:26:41,686 --> 00:26:42,779
Put them through.

512
00:26:42,822 --> 00:26:44,290
Gentlemen...

513
00:26:44,325 --> 00:26:46,956
a magnificent victory
lies before us.

514
00:26:46,997 --> 00:26:49,969
I trust those are
prophetic words, Chancellor.

515
00:26:50,003 --> 00:26:51,836
They are... and
I've not forgotten

516
00:26:51,873 --> 00:26:55,243
the promise I made
to both of you.

517
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:56,544
That the three of us would share

518
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:58,246
a bottle of bloodwine
on Cardassia Prime.

519
00:26:58,287 --> 00:26:59,653
"A bottle"?

520
00:27:00,858 --> 00:27:03,830
I brought a barrel of 2309.

521
00:27:03,931 --> 00:27:05,798
There is no finer vintage.

522
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:09,034
Then I'll meet you both
on Cardassia.

523
00:27:09,074 --> 00:27:11,442
We'll see who gets there first.

524
00:27:13,417 --> 00:27:15,751
The Chancellor makes
victory sound easy.

525
00:27:15,788 --> 00:27:17,485
He knows it won't be.

526
00:27:17,525 --> 00:27:19,461
Sisko to all hands.

527
00:27:19,495 --> 00:27:21,260
Prepare to engage the enemy.

528
00:27:45,214 --> 00:27:47,013
I'll say one thing
for the Breen...

529
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:48,917
they know how
to pilot their ships.

530
00:27:48,987 --> 00:27:50,012
So do you, Ensign.

531
00:27:50,056 --> 00:27:51,115
Stay with him.

532
00:27:51,158 --> 00:27:53,458
I'm trying, but he's slippery.

533
00:27:53,497 --> 00:27:54,522
Mr. Worf?

534
00:27:54,565 --> 00:27:56,865
Unable to lock target.

535
00:27:59,709 --> 00:28:01,679
We have two Jem'Hadar ships

536
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:05,244
closing aft of us,
bearing 136 mark 4.

537
00:28:05,287 --> 00:28:06,984
Evasive action, pattern delta.

538
00:28:08,092 --> 00:28:09,526
Hang on.

539
00:28:19,549 --> 00:28:20,778
Well done, Ensign.

540
00:28:20,818 --> 00:28:22,720
But I lost the Breen ship
we were after.

541
00:28:22,755 --> 00:28:24,315
I wouldn't worry about it.

542
00:28:24,358 --> 00:28:26,590
There are plenty more
to choose from.

543
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:40,146
You've hardly touched your meal.

544
00:28:40,189 --> 00:28:42,421
No wonder you're
not looking well.

545
00:28:42,461 --> 00:28:45,592
I'm not looking well
because I live in a cellar.

546
00:28:45,634 --> 00:28:47,433
Well, so does Legate Damar.

547
00:28:47,471 --> 00:28:48,769
And what about him?

548
00:28:48,807 --> 00:28:51,243
Well, he's finished
everything on his plate

549
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,770
which explains

550
00:28:52,815 --> 00:28:55,217
why he is such a fine,
handsome figure of a man.

551
00:28:55,254 --> 00:28:56,985
Oh, I'm afraid
I don't follow you.

552
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:58,217
I do.

553
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,457
Mila, I believe you're
falling in love.

554
00:29:00,497 --> 00:29:02,729
Oh, I'm old enough
to be his mother.

555
00:29:02,768 --> 00:29:04,738
Ah-ah.

556
00:29:04,772 --> 00:29:06,401
Nonsense.

557
00:29:06,442 --> 00:29:08,105
Politicians.

558
00:29:11,286 --> 00:29:12,915
Now, who could that be?

559
00:29:12,955 --> 00:29:14,788
Uh... I'll go see.

560
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,075
Uh, may I help you?

561
00:29:25,112 --> 00:29:27,605
What's taking her so long?

562
00:29:27,651 --> 00:29:29,917
I don't know.

563
00:29:35,934 --> 00:29:37,300
Mila!

564
00:29:38,607 --> 00:29:39,666
Garak!

565
00:29:40,611 --> 00:29:42,638
Garak, get out of there!

566
00:30:34,017 --> 00:30:35,953
I can't look away for a second.

567
00:30:35,987 --> 00:30:37,650
Just fix the shoulder.

568
00:30:37,691 --> 00:30:39,752
Careful!

569
00:30:39,795 --> 00:30:40,763
Sit still or you'll end up

570
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:42,026
with one arm shorter
than the other.

571
00:30:43,068 --> 00:30:45,699
You'd do anything
to beat me at darts.

572
00:30:45,741 --> 00:30:48,143
I haven't lost
a game to you in months.

573
00:30:48,212 --> 00:30:49,680
I'm going to miss
our games, Julian.

574
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:51,344
What are you talking about?

575
00:30:51,386 --> 00:30:53,049
You're going to be fine.

576
00:30:53,088 --> 00:30:54,648
I'm leaving DS9, Julian.

577
00:30:54,692 --> 00:30:56,024
I'm moving back to Earth.

578
00:30:56,061 --> 00:30:57,792
Why?

579
00:30:57,831 --> 00:30:59,299
I've been offered

580
00:30:59,334 --> 00:31:01,395
a position
at the Starfleet Academy...

581
00:31:01,439 --> 00:31:03,102
Professor of Engineering.

582
00:31:03,175 --> 00:31:04,507
When?

583
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,106
When the war's over.

584
00:31:07,183 --> 00:31:09,483
Oh... I see.

585
00:31:09,522 --> 00:31:11,048
Somebody has to teach
you officers

586
00:31:11,091 --> 00:31:12,754
the difference
between a warp matrix

587
00:31:12,795 --> 00:31:17,430
flux capacitor
and a self-sealing stem bolt.

588
00:31:17,471 --> 00:31:19,873
Of course, of course.

589
00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:22,106
Captain, Admiral Ross for you.

590
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:23,273
On screen.

591
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:26,412
The Romulan flagship's
been destroyed.

592
00:31:26,456 --> 00:31:27,856
Their entire line is collapsing.

593
00:31:27,891 --> 00:31:29,520
We'll try to help.

594
00:31:29,562 --> 00:31:30,621
With what?

595
00:31:30,664 --> 00:31:32,155
Ben, we're losing
too many ships.

596
00:31:32,233 --> 00:31:35,034
We've got to find a way to turn
the Dominion's left flank.

597
00:31:35,072 --> 00:31:36,563
It's too well protected

598
00:31:36,609 --> 00:31:38,579
but their lines are spread
pretty thin in the middle.

599
00:31:40,182 --> 00:31:41,150
You help the Romulans.

600
00:31:41,184 --> 00:31:42,778
Martok and I
will hit the center.

601
00:31:42,821 --> 00:31:44,016
On my way.

602
00:31:44,057 --> 00:31:46,688
Dax, have attack wings
64 and 65 follow us.

603
00:31:46,729 --> 00:31:48,129
Aye, sir.

604
00:31:48,165 --> 00:31:50,362
What's taking so long?

605
00:31:50,402 --> 00:31:52,031
Our engineers have assured me

606
00:31:52,073 --> 00:31:54,066
that our long-range
communications

607
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,807
will be restored momentarily.

608
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:58,147
But you have been
saying that for hours

609
00:31:58,185 --> 00:32:01,351
and meantime, there's no way
of contacting our ships

610
00:32:01,391 --> 00:32:04,158
no way of knowing how
the battle is progressing.

611
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:05,459
Founder

612
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,631
our troops have captured
the traitor Damar.

613
00:32:08,673 --> 00:32:10,141
Finally...

614
00:32:10,175 --> 00:32:11,541
some good news.

615
00:32:11,579 --> 00:32:13,047
And there's more.

616
00:32:13,081 --> 00:32:14,344
Colonel Kira

617
00:32:14,384 --> 00:32:16,684
and Garak have been
apprehended with him.

618
00:32:16,722 --> 00:32:17,985
Even better.

619
00:32:18,025 --> 00:32:19,995
Shall I have them brought here?

620
00:32:20,029 --> 00:32:22,397
What for?

621
00:32:23,903 --> 00:32:26,305
Have them executed...

622
00:32:26,341 --> 00:32:28,208
immediately.

623
00:32:28,278 --> 00:32:31,512
With pleasure.

624
00:32:38,031 --> 00:32:38,999
Understood.

625
00:32:39,033 --> 00:32:40,399
It will be done at once.

626
00:32:40,436 --> 00:32:41,461
On your feet.

627
00:32:41,505 --> 00:32:43,134
Why?

628
00:32:44,344 --> 00:32:47,373
We prefer our prisoners to be
standing when they die.

629
00:32:48,953 --> 00:32:53,257
Does anyone have
any last words?

630
00:32:53,295 --> 00:32:55,424
You may kill us,
but Cardassia will never...

631
00:32:55,466 --> 00:32:56,525
Enough.

632
00:32:56,569 --> 00:32:58,505
Final words are not permitted.

633
00:32:58,539 --> 00:33:00,270
How disappointing.

634
00:33:00,376 --> 00:33:01,605
Ready weapons.

635
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:04,915
On my mark.

636
00:33:11,264 --> 00:33:13,029
That's for Lakarian City.

637
00:33:17,476 --> 00:33:20,414
Legate Damar, I pledge my life

638
00:33:20,449 --> 00:33:22,351
to free Cardassia
from the Dominion.

639
00:33:22,386 --> 00:33:25,017
With men like you on our side...

640
00:33:25,059 --> 00:33:26,619
how can we fail?

641
00:33:44,293 --> 00:33:45,819
Jem'Hadar ship off the port bow.

642
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,797
Shields are down to 60 percent.

643
00:33:47,834 --> 00:33:49,667
Miles, this is no good.

644
00:33:49,704 --> 00:33:51,298
I'm going to have
to get you to Sick Bay.

645
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,003
I'm kind of busy right now.

646
00:33:53,044 --> 00:33:54,012
That's an order.

647
00:33:54,046 --> 00:33:55,014
Look, Julian!

648
00:33:55,048 --> 00:33:56,243
You heard him, Chief.

649
00:33:56,283 --> 00:33:58,344
Yes, sir.

650
00:33:58,387 --> 00:34:00,482
Another Jem'Hadar to port.

651
00:34:01,628 --> 00:34:03,962
Transferring auxiliary power
to the port shields.

652
00:34:03,999 --> 00:34:06,333
Dax, we need some support
from our attack fighters.

653
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:07,338
Aye, sir.

654
00:34:07,372 --> 00:34:10,503
Breen ship off
the starboard aft.

655
00:34:10,545 --> 00:34:11,808
Sir, most of our fighters

656
00:34:11,915 --> 00:34:14,351
are either destroyed
or under attack themselves.

657
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,015
Ensign, get us out of here.

658
00:34:16,056 --> 00:34:18,549
I'm trying, sir.

659
00:34:33,257 --> 00:34:34,225
Sir...

660
00:34:34,259 --> 00:34:35,819
the Cardassians...

661
00:34:35,863 --> 00:34:38,333
they're attacking
the other Dominion ships.

662
00:34:47,853 --> 00:34:49,516
They've switched sides.

663
00:34:49,556 --> 00:34:51,150
Yes!

664
00:34:51,193 --> 00:34:52,890
The timing couldn't be better.

665
00:34:52,997 --> 00:34:55,628
Come about and head
for the center of their lines.

666
00:34:55,669 --> 00:34:57,730
This is our chance
to punch through.

667
00:34:57,773 --> 00:34:58,934
Aye, sir.

668
00:35:03,752 --> 00:35:06,120
Founder, our long-range
communications

669
00:35:06,156 --> 00:35:07,624
are back on line.

670
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,926
It's about time.

671
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:15,037
I don't believe it.

672
00:35:16,443 --> 00:35:17,604
What now?

673
00:35:17,647 --> 00:35:20,585
The Cardassian fleet
has turned against us.

674
00:35:24,526 --> 00:35:27,157
Have our forces pull back

675
00:35:27,198 --> 00:35:29,600
and regroup at Cardassia Prime.

676
00:35:29,637 --> 00:35:31,539
But we'll be totally surrounded.

677
00:35:31,573 --> 00:35:34,568
There will be
no more running.

678
00:35:35,783 --> 00:35:38,015
We should've rid ourselves
of the Cardassians

679
00:35:38,054 --> 00:35:40,024
at the first sign of rebellion.

680
00:35:42,162 --> 00:35:45,932
If I could talk to the rebels...
get them to change their minds.

681
00:35:45,969 --> 00:35:49,100
Perhaps you could reawaken
their patriotic spirit.

682
00:35:49,142 --> 00:35:50,542
Exactly.

683
00:35:50,578 --> 00:35:52,377
On the other hand,
they're just as likely

684
00:35:52,415 --> 00:35:55,854
to convince you to betray us.

685
00:35:55,889 --> 00:35:57,050
Me?

686
00:35:57,092 --> 00:35:58,253
Betray you?

687
00:35:58,294 --> 00:35:59,820
- Never!
- That's right.

688
00:35:59,864 --> 00:36:02,266
We are not going to give you
that opportunity.

689
00:36:03,672 --> 00:36:06,074
Wait! You're making
a terrible mistake.

690
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:08,080
I don't think so.

691
00:36:08,114 --> 00:36:09,913
But I've done everything
you've asked.

692
00:36:09,984 --> 00:36:11,316
I tell you, I'm loyal!

693
00:36:11,353 --> 00:36:14,018
I believe in the Dominion!
No! Wait! No!

694
00:36:14,059 --> 00:36:16,690
I won't miss him.

695
00:36:16,731 --> 00:36:19,532
I want the Cardassians
exterminated.

696
00:36:19,569 --> 00:36:21,037
Which ones?

697
00:36:21,073 --> 00:36:24,204
All of them...
the entire population.

698
00:36:24,246 --> 00:36:26,877
That will take some time.

699
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:29,754
Then I suggest
that you begin at once.

700
00:36:45,188 --> 00:36:46,987
Captain, the Dominion forces

701
00:36:47,025 --> 00:36:49,086
are retreating
towards Cardassia Prime.

702
00:36:49,129 --> 00:36:51,156
Sir? Admiral Ross
and Chancellor Martok

703
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,897
would like to talk to you.

704
00:36:52,937 --> 00:36:55,271
On screen.

705
00:36:55,308 --> 00:36:56,937
I never thought I'd say this

706
00:36:56,978 --> 00:36:58,709
but thank God
for the Cardassians.

707
00:36:58,748 --> 00:37:01,743
As I predicted, the day is ours.

708
00:37:01,788 --> 00:37:03,451
Not yet, it isn't.

709
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:06,553
Ben, we've driven the Dominion
back into Cardassia Prime.

710
00:37:06,597 --> 00:37:09,296
We can keep them bottled up
there indefinitely.

711
00:37:09,336 --> 00:37:11,967
What if they use this time
to rebuild their fleet?

712
00:37:12,075 --> 00:37:13,065
He's right.

713
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,807
The Dominion has
displayed an ability

714
00:37:14,847 --> 00:37:17,340
to build ships
at an impressive rate.

715
00:37:17,385 --> 00:37:19,412
We should continue the attack.

716
00:37:19,456 --> 00:37:20,754
At what cost?

717
00:37:20,792 --> 00:37:23,320
We've already lost
a third of our fleet.

718
00:37:23,364 --> 00:37:24,662
Then we must see to it

719
00:37:24,699 --> 00:37:27,637
that those soldiers
did not die in vain.

720
00:37:27,672 --> 00:37:31,008
Admiral, with the Cardassians
joining us

721
00:37:31,046 --> 00:37:32,241
we have an opportunity

722
00:37:32,282 --> 00:37:34,684
to put an end to this war
once and for all.

723
00:37:37,392 --> 00:37:39,157
All right, gentlemen.

724
00:37:39,195 --> 00:37:41,392
We press on.

725
00:37:41,433 --> 00:37:46,569
My friends, songs will
be sung about this day.

726
00:37:47,211 --> 00:37:49,147
All right, people...

727
00:37:49,182 --> 00:37:50,947
you heard the orders.

728
00:37:50,986 --> 00:37:53,252
Let's finish what we started.

729
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:08,648
Let me guess...

730
00:38:11,193 --> 00:38:12,787
we're here.

731
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:15,961
We've reached the end
of one journey

732
00:38:16,003 --> 00:38:18,907
and stand ready
to begin another.

733
00:38:23,852 --> 00:38:26,322
What's the matter, Dukat?

734
00:38:26,356 --> 00:38:28,485
You look disappointed.

735
00:38:28,527 --> 00:38:33,492
Well, this may sound naive,
but I was expecting to see fire.

736
00:38:33,537 --> 00:38:37,341
They are called the fire caves.

737
00:38:37,378 --> 00:38:39,871
And with good reason.

738
00:38:47,732 --> 00:38:51,297
<i>Lano ka'la bo'shar</i>
<i>lanu no'vala</i>

739
00:38:51,339 --> 00:38:54,311
<i>pahrom carana mokado ba'jah.</i>

740
00:38:54,345 --> 00:38:57,408
<i>Ko'se nusso</i>
<i>ma'kora kajani...</i>

741
00:38:57,452 --> 00:39:01,985
<i>lano ka'la Kosst Amojan.</i>

742
00:39:09,576 --> 00:39:10,976
Is that better?

743
00:39:32,121 --> 00:39:34,455
According to this map,
it's a long way

744
00:39:34,492 --> 00:39:36,587
from the cargo door
to the briefing room.

745
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:37,689
Well, that could be a problem

746
00:39:37,732 --> 00:39:38,995
if we get trapped
in the corridor.

747
00:39:40,271 --> 00:39:41,261
What the hell?

748
00:39:41,306 --> 00:39:42,365
It's the Jem'Hadar.

749
00:39:42,408 --> 00:39:44,002
They're leveling the city,
building by building.

750
00:39:44,045 --> 00:39:45,878
All right, we have to go now.

751
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:47,818
Once we get inside the complex

752
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:50,118
we stop at nothing
until we capture the changeling.

753
00:39:50,157 --> 00:39:51,625
- Let it be done!
- We're with you!

754
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,894
- For Cardassia!
- For Cardassia!

755
00:39:57,906 --> 00:39:59,067
Garak.

756
00:39:59,108 --> 00:40:00,805
All during the years of my exile

757
00:40:00,844 --> 00:40:03,543
I imagined what it would
be like to come home.

758
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:06,181
I even thought of living
in this house again

759
00:40:06,256 --> 00:40:08,385
with Mila...

760
00:40:08,427 --> 00:40:10,090
but now she's dead

761
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:12,829
and this house
is about to be reduced

762
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,359
to a pile of rubble.

763
00:40:14,405 --> 00:40:16,466
My Cardassia is gone.

764
00:40:16,509 --> 00:40:18,638
Then fight for a new Cardassia.

765
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:24,314
I have an even better
reason, Commander.

766
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:25,588
Revenge.

767
00:40:27,098 --> 00:40:29,173
That works, too.

768
00:40:45,405 --> 00:40:46,600
Oh!

769
00:40:46,641 --> 00:40:49,204
I rid myself of the Prophets

770
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:52,343
and shed a lifetime
of hypocrisy.

771
00:41:00,902 --> 00:41:03,738
I've never seen you
look so radiant.

772
00:41:03,775 --> 00:41:05,369
I feel like a young woman

773
00:41:05,412 --> 00:41:07,882
waiting for my lover
to sweep me away.

774
00:41:07,949 --> 00:41:11,787
Do you give yourself willingly
to the Pah-wraiths?

775
00:41:11,824 --> 00:41:13,487
With all my heart.

776
00:41:13,528 --> 00:41:15,589
Then call to them.

777
00:41:17,002 --> 00:41:18,972
Bring me the book.

778
00:41:26,087 --> 00:41:28,923
<i>Meek rak dorrah Pah-wran.</i>

779
00:41:28,958 --> 00:41:31,428
<i>Yelim cha ono Kosst Amojan...</i>

780
00:41:31,464 --> 00:41:33,525
<i>shay ta-hel ter-rah</i>

781
00:41:33,568 --> 00:41:35,162
<i>no'vala de-ram...</i>

782
00:41:41,817 --> 00:41:43,183
Sisko to Bashir.

783
00:41:43,221 --> 00:41:44,587
Report.

784
00:41:44,623 --> 00:41:46,820
Three dead, eight wounded...
four of them critically.

785
00:41:46,861 --> 00:41:49,697
Doctor, I need every able-bodied
crewman at their post.

786
00:41:49,733 --> 00:41:50,701
I won't keep anybody here

787
00:41:50,735 --> 00:41:52,500
a second longer
than I have to, sir.

788
00:41:53,641 --> 00:41:54,768
Put him over here, will you?

789
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:56,473
She did pretty well
for a first date

790
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,575
don't you think, Captain?

791
00:41:58,618 --> 00:42:01,111
I'd say she did fine, Ensign.

792
00:42:02,893 --> 00:42:04,361
Mr. Worf.

793
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:07,061
Sir, phaser banks
are fully charged

794
00:42:07,102 --> 00:42:10,199
but we are down
to 45 quantum torpedoes.

795
00:42:10,241 --> 00:42:12,769
That'll have to do.

796
00:42:12,813 --> 00:42:14,612
How are you holding up, old man?

797
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:17,086
All things considered

798
00:42:17,122 --> 00:42:18,921
I think I'd rather be on Risa.

799
00:42:18,958 --> 00:42:20,655
Well...

800
00:42:20,695 --> 00:42:22,790
that makes two of us.

801
00:42:26,373 --> 00:42:28,536
Have you seen these
reports, Captain?

802
00:42:28,578 --> 00:42:32,211
The Dominion has begun
destroying Cardassian cities.

803
00:42:32,252 --> 00:42:34,449
Millions of people are dying.

804
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:37,724
Captain, we're approaching
the Dominion defense perimeter.

805
00:42:37,762 --> 00:42:40,255
Well...

806
00:42:40,301 --> 00:42:43,296
let's see what they
have waiting for us.

807
00:42:43,341 --> 00:42:45,470
On screen.

808
00:43:01,544 --> 00:43:03,537
Now we know.

809
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:14,435
We have a problem.

810
00:43:14,469 --> 00:43:15,494
Just one?

811
00:43:15,538 --> 00:43:16,972
I'm afraid it's
a rather large problem.

812
00:43:17,007 --> 00:43:19,204
The cargo door is
made of neutronium.

813
00:43:20,648 --> 00:43:21,980
Then the explosives we brought

814
00:43:22,017 --> 00:43:23,508
aren't even going
to make a dent.

815
00:43:23,554 --> 00:43:24,852
You see the problem.

816
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:26,256
What do we do?

817
00:43:26,293 --> 00:43:28,890
I don't know

818
00:43:28,931 --> 00:43:30,730
but I'm through hiding
in basements.

819
00:43:33,774 --> 00:43:35,869
I fail to see
what is so funny, Garak.

820
00:43:35,912 --> 00:43:39,248
Well, isn't it obvious?

821
00:43:39,286 --> 00:43:42,156
Here we are, ready
to storm the castle

822
00:43:42,192 --> 00:43:44,720
willing to sacrifice our lives

823
00:43:44,763 --> 00:43:46,061
in the noble effort

824
00:43:46,099 --> 00:43:48,935
to slay the Dominion
beast in its lair...

825
00:43:50,308 --> 00:43:53,873
we can't even get
inside the gates.

826
00:43:56,119 --> 00:43:58,612
Maybe... maybe we could
go up to the door, and...

827
00:43:58,658 --> 00:44:01,289
and ask the Jem'Hadar
to let us in?

828
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:02,662
Why don't we just have them

829
00:44:02,699 --> 00:44:04,396
send the shape-shifter
out to us?

830
00:44:11,684 --> 00:44:13,175
As I said...

831
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,452
we have a problem.

832
00:44:18,129 --> 00:44:22,194
But I've come to depend on
having you here at my side.

833
00:44:24,008 --> 00:44:27,412
Your advice to the Dominion
has proven invaluable.

834
00:44:29,186 --> 00:44:30,449
Very well.

835
00:44:30,488 --> 00:44:33,460
If you feel the situation
on the front lines

836
00:44:33,494 --> 00:44:34,928
demands your presence

837
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:36,933
I will not stand
in your way.

838
00:44:36,967 --> 00:44:39,962
Knowing that you'll be leading
our troops into battle

839
00:44:40,006 --> 00:44:41,805
is very reassuring.

840
00:44:51,129 --> 00:44:53,999
I still can't help but wonder.

841
00:44:54,034 --> 00:44:55,127
Wonder what?

842
00:44:55,238 --> 00:44:57,937
What's under that helmet.

843
00:44:57,976 --> 00:45:01,312
A braver man than you are.

844
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:04,915
Though I do find
the shrillness of his voice

845
00:45:04,956 --> 00:45:07,119
very... tiresome.

846
00:45:09,666 --> 00:45:11,363
Founder, what's wrong?

847
00:45:13,641 --> 00:45:15,406
I'm dying.

848
00:45:15,444 --> 00:45:17,778
That's what's wrong.

849
00:45:17,816 --> 00:45:19,718
Perhaps you should
rest for a while...

850
00:45:19,753 --> 00:45:21,848
revert to your natural state.

851
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:25,660
I haven't been able
to change form

852
00:45:25,698 --> 00:45:27,395
in weeks.

853
00:45:29,739 --> 00:45:33,406
It's ironic, isn't it?

854
00:45:33,447 --> 00:45:35,747
That I should die as a solid.

855
00:45:35,785 --> 00:45:38,051
You're not going to die.

856
00:45:38,089 --> 00:45:39,956
You're a God.

857
00:45:39,993 --> 00:45:43,159
My loyal Weyoun...

858
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:46,638
the only solid
I have ever trusted.

859
00:45:46,673 --> 00:45:48,575
I live

860
00:45:48,611 --> 00:45:50,843
only to serve you.

861
00:45:50,882 --> 00:45:53,352
And you have served me well.

862
00:45:55,591 --> 00:45:58,358
I don't mind dying.

863
00:45:58,397 --> 00:46:01,494
It's knowing that my entire race

864
00:46:01,536 --> 00:46:04,029
is dying of the same illness

865
00:46:04,074 --> 00:46:07,171
and there is nothing
I can do about it.

866
00:46:09,218 --> 00:46:11,245
I would give my life

867
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:12,850
to save yours.

868
00:46:12,892 --> 00:46:17,196
If only it were that simple.

869
00:46:20,206 --> 00:46:21,697
What if I give myself up...

870
00:46:21,743 --> 00:46:23,406
pretend to be your prisoner?

871
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,938
They'd kill you on sight.

872
00:46:24,983 --> 00:46:26,509
And us along with you.

873
00:46:28,022 --> 00:46:29,320
The cargo door...

874
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:31,659
You're making
a terrible mistake!

875
00:46:31,697 --> 00:46:33,063
I'm not a traitor!

876
00:46:33,099 --> 00:46:36,367
Please, just let me
speak to the Founder!

877
00:46:36,406 --> 00:46:37,669
No! Wait!

878
00:46:37,709 --> 00:46:38,699
No!

879
00:46:40,213 --> 00:46:41,374
No!

880
00:46:42,885 --> 00:46:47,053
- For Cardassia!
- For Cardassia!

881
00:46:59,619 --> 00:47:01,885
Fall back!
Fall back!

882
00:47:11,743 --> 00:47:13,542
Keep...

883
00:47:15,684 --> 00:47:16,982
He's dead.

884
00:47:18,857 --> 00:47:20,223
Remember his orders.

885
00:47:20,293 --> 00:47:21,420
We stop for nothing.

886
00:47:22,899 --> 00:47:25,632
For Cardassia!

887
00:47:25,671 --> 00:47:28,107
Cardassia!

888
00:47:28,142 --> 00:47:30,807
We have a security breach.

889
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,750
The guards will deal with it.

890
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:36,524
Is there a problem?

891
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,189
The guards...

892
00:47:38,229 --> 00:47:40,826
there's only a handful
left in the building.

893
00:47:40,868 --> 00:47:43,863
I sent the rest to help
eradicate the Cardassians.

894
00:47:45,945 --> 00:47:47,243
You two, get out there

895
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,877
and see that no one
gets through that door.

896
00:47:51,222 --> 00:47:52,919
You stay here

897
00:47:52,959 --> 00:47:54,792
in case they fail.

898
00:48:00,063 --> 00:48:01,896
We'll launch
a three-pronged attack.

899
00:48:01,933 --> 00:48:04,461
The Romulans and our new
Cardassian allies

900
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:06,237
will engage
the Jem'Hadar forces.

901
00:48:06,275 --> 00:48:08,575
The Klingons will target
the Breen

902
00:48:08,614 --> 00:48:10,481
and the Federation
will take on

903
00:48:10,518 --> 00:48:12,351
the orbital weapon platforms.

904
00:48:12,387 --> 00:48:13,753
Any questions?

905
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:14,780
When do we go?

906
00:48:14,826 --> 00:48:16,489
As soon as everyone's
in position.

907
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:19,661
It will be a glorious battle.

908
00:48:19,702 --> 00:48:20,670
But a costly one.

909
00:48:20,704 --> 00:48:22,104
Estimates project
our casualties

910
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:24,042
to be as high as 40 percent.

911
00:48:24,077 --> 00:48:27,106
There's no telling
how much higher they'll go

912
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:29,177
once we send in
our ground forces.

913
00:48:29,221 --> 00:48:31,521
The Dominion is beaten
and they know it

914
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,154
but they're going
to make us pay

915
00:48:33,196 --> 00:48:34,961
for every kilometer
of the planet.

916
00:48:34,999 --> 00:48:36,662
Yes, they will.

917
00:48:38,574 --> 00:48:39,872
Let's get on with it.

918
00:48:41,212 --> 00:48:42,305
Godspeed, everyone.

919
00:48:42,347 --> 00:48:43,838
<i>Qapla'.</i>

920
00:48:46,756 --> 00:48:48,316
Founder,
perhaps we should consider

921
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:49,622
finding a safer location.

922
00:48:49,662 --> 00:48:51,495
And just where would that be?

923
00:49:06,696 --> 00:49:08,325
Well...

924
00:49:08,366 --> 00:49:10,029
Colonel Kira...

925
00:49:10,069 --> 00:49:13,064
what a pleasant surprise.

926
00:49:13,109 --> 00:49:15,011
The pleasure's all mine.

927
00:49:15,046 --> 00:49:18,041
The Federation fleet
has surrounded the planet.

928
00:49:18,085 --> 00:49:21,319
I want you to contact
the Jem'Hadar and the Breen

929
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:23,521
and you order their ships
to stand down.

930
00:49:23,563 --> 00:49:26,433
And order the troops on
Cardassia to do the same.

931
00:49:26,469 --> 00:49:28,871
I will do no such thing.

932
00:49:28,974 --> 00:49:32,709
Tell me, where is
my old friend Damar?

933
00:49:32,748 --> 00:49:34,377
Damar is dead.

934
00:49:34,418 --> 00:49:36,445
What a pity.

935
00:49:36,489 --> 00:49:39,222
He died trying
to free Cardassia.

936
00:49:39,261 --> 00:49:41,789
What's left of it.

937
00:49:50,149 --> 00:49:53,315
I wish you hadn't done that.

938
00:49:53,356 --> 00:49:56,351
That was Weyoun's last clone.

939
00:49:56,395 --> 00:49:58,422
I was hoping you'd say that.

940
00:50:00,971 --> 00:50:03,203
This war's over.

941
00:50:03,242 --> 00:50:04,335
You lost.

942
00:50:04,378 --> 00:50:07,316
Have I?

943
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:10,618
I think you'll find
that neither the Jem'Hadar

944
00:50:10,657 --> 00:50:13,857
or the Breen will agree
with that assessment.

945
00:50:13,897 --> 00:50:16,698
They will fight to the last man.

946
00:50:16,736 --> 00:50:18,831
And what will that accomplish?

947
00:50:20,243 --> 00:50:22,840
Isn't it obvious?

948
00:50:22,882 --> 00:50:25,854
You may win this war, Commander

949
00:50:25,888 --> 00:50:28,985
but I promise you,
when it is over

950
00:50:29,027 --> 00:50:33,297
you will have lost
so many ships, so many lives

951
00:50:33,335 --> 00:50:38,334
that your victory will taste
as bitter as defeat.

952
00:50:44,859 --> 00:50:47,193
We're glad to find you
in one piece, Commander.

953
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:48,198
Very glad.

954
00:50:48,232 --> 00:50:49,963
What's your status?

955
00:50:50,002 --> 00:50:52,370
Only three of us
made it to the briefing room.

956
00:50:52,407 --> 00:50:53,841
What about Damar?

957
00:50:53,877 --> 00:50:55,403
He's dead.

958
00:50:57,484 --> 00:50:58,952
Is your position secure?

959
00:50:58,987 --> 00:51:01,618
I don't think
the Jem'Hadar will attack.

960
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:04,324
They won't risk
endangering the Founder

961
00:51:04,364 --> 00:51:06,391
and she's in pretty bad shape.

962
00:51:06,435 --> 00:51:09,532
She just sits at her desk
deteriorating.

963
00:51:09,575 --> 00:51:12,342
If she dies before ordering
the Jem'Hadar to surrender...

964
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:14,873
Then they will fight
to the last man.

965
00:51:14,919 --> 00:51:17,720
Captain,
I should beam down there.

966
00:51:17,758 --> 00:51:19,591
The Founder will speak to me.

967
00:51:19,629 --> 00:51:21,029
I can reason with her.

968
00:51:21,098 --> 00:51:23,763
You haven't had much success
with her in the past.

969
00:51:23,803 --> 00:51:25,032
It's worth a try.

970
00:51:25,139 --> 00:51:27,132
Think of the lives
it could save.

971
00:51:29,047 --> 00:51:30,812
Very well.

972
00:51:30,851 --> 00:51:32,342
Commander

973
00:51:32,387 --> 00:51:35,986
tell the Founder that Odo
is going to pay her a visit.

974
00:51:48,018 --> 00:51:51,822
<i>Tarna pur-ono</i>
<i>ull-kess Pah-wran.</i>

975
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:56,699
<i>Lano ka'la bo'shar lanu.</i>

976
00:51:59,207 --> 00:52:01,143
After you.

977
00:52:02,547 --> 00:52:04,312
I'm honored.

978
00:52:12,901 --> 00:52:14,199
Now you.

979
00:52:33,208 --> 00:52:35,110
Why?!

980
00:52:35,212 --> 00:52:38,116
The Pah-wraiths
demand a sacrifice...

981
00:52:38,218 --> 00:52:40,518
someone worthy of them.

982
00:52:40,556 --> 00:52:41,819
Who better than you?

983
00:53:02,266 --> 00:53:05,899
I offer you this life
as nourishment

984
00:53:05,941 --> 00:53:07,570
to feed your hunger

985
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:12,575
to fuel the fires
that will set you free.

986
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:19,499
Kosst Amojan,
I am yours, now and forever!

987
00:53:30,256 --> 00:53:32,488
Nerys...

988
00:53:34,597 --> 00:53:36,031
It's been a while.

989
00:53:36,067 --> 00:53:37,399
Yes.

990
00:53:37,436 --> 00:53:39,929
Watch yourself.
I don't trust her.

991
00:53:39,975 --> 00:53:42,411
But you trust me?

992
00:53:42,446 --> 00:53:45,009
Of course.

993
00:53:45,052 --> 00:53:47,751
That's all I need to know.

994
00:53:49,427 --> 00:53:50,725
Constable.

995
00:53:50,764 --> 00:53:52,927
Garak.

996
00:53:52,968 --> 00:53:54,938
You're looking well, Odo.

997
00:53:54,972 --> 00:53:56,942
Thank you for seeing me.

998
00:53:56,976 --> 00:54:00,609
It's always good to see you...

999
00:54:00,649 --> 00:54:04,612
but I have no intention
of surrendering my forces.

1000
00:54:04,657 --> 00:54:07,527
It would be a sign
of weakness on my part...

1001
00:54:07,563 --> 00:54:11,628
an invitation to the solids
to cross into the Gamma Quadrant

1002
00:54:11,671 --> 00:54:13,300
and destroy the Great Link.

1003
00:54:13,342 --> 00:54:15,039
Believe me, I'm well aware

1004
00:54:15,079 --> 00:54:17,311
that the Federation
has its flaws

1005
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:19,981
but a desire for conquest
isn't one of them.

1006
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:23,590
And what of the Klingons
and the Romulans?

1007
00:54:23,629 --> 00:54:25,929
Can you make that claim
for them, too?

1008
00:54:25,967 --> 00:54:27,732
The Klingon and Romulan Empires

1009
00:54:27,771 --> 00:54:30,207
are in no shape to wage
war against anyone.

1010
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:33,942
Besides, the Federation
wouldn't allow it.

1011
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:36,385
The Dominion has spent
the last two years

1012
00:54:36,421 --> 00:54:38,220
trying to destroy
the Federation

1013
00:54:38,325 --> 00:54:42,960
and now you're asking me
to put our fate in their hands?

1014
00:54:43,001 --> 00:54:45,871
Yes.

1015
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:47,968
I can't do that, Odo.

1016
00:54:48,011 --> 00:54:50,539
I don't have your faith
in the solids.

1017
00:54:50,582 --> 00:54:53,018
But perhaps I can
change your mind.

1018
00:54:54,691 --> 00:54:56,251
Link with me.

1019
00:54:56,361 --> 00:54:58,661
Odo, what are you doing?

1020
00:54:58,699 --> 00:55:01,751
I'm afraid I can't link
with you, Odo.

1021
00:55:01,885 --> 00:55:05,051
My disease prevents me
from changing form.

1022
00:55:05,091 --> 00:55:09,088
If we link,
I believe I can cure you.

1023
00:55:09,133 --> 00:55:11,194
That's a very bad idea,
Constable.

1024
00:55:11,237 --> 00:55:12,398
I agree.

1025
00:55:12,439 --> 00:55:15,206
Nerys, I know what I'm doing.

1026
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:18,274
Please, take my hand.

1027
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:21,654
And if you cure me...

1028
00:55:21,691 --> 00:55:23,422
what will you ask in return?

1029
00:55:23,461 --> 00:55:26,763
All I ask is that
you link with me.

1030
00:55:26,869 --> 00:55:28,498
I'm warning you, Odo.

1031
00:55:28,538 --> 00:55:30,667
Nerys...

1032
00:55:30,709 --> 00:55:32,508
Garak...

1033
00:55:32,546 --> 00:55:34,175
put down your weapon.

1034
00:55:34,216 --> 00:55:35,514
I don't think so.

1035
00:55:35,552 --> 00:55:38,217
I said put it down.

1036
00:56:03,274 --> 00:56:04,708
Move aside, Odo.

1037
00:56:04,743 --> 00:56:07,236
That won't be necessary...

1038
00:56:07,282 --> 00:56:09,275
will it?

1039
00:56:14,965 --> 00:56:16,935
If you will stand aside

1040
00:56:16,969 --> 00:56:20,271
I'll order the Jem'Hadar
to cease fire.

1041
00:56:20,308 --> 00:56:23,803
I suggest we secure her
in a containment field.

1042
00:56:23,916 --> 00:56:25,545
Don't worry, Garak.

1043
00:56:25,585 --> 00:56:27,555
She won't try to escape.

1044
00:56:27,589 --> 00:56:29,422
She's agreed to stand trial

1045
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:32,591
and accept responsibility
for what she's done.

1046
00:56:36,774 --> 00:56:38,676
I would've thought she'd insist

1047
00:56:38,711 --> 00:56:40,840
on going back
to the Gamma Quadrant

1048
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:42,248
to cure her people.

1049
00:56:42,285 --> 00:56:43,948
There's no need for that.

1050
00:56:45,625 --> 00:56:48,290
I'm going in her place.

1051
00:56:49,633 --> 00:56:51,124
For how long?

1052
00:56:52,305 --> 00:56:55,277
Nerys...

1053
00:56:55,311 --> 00:56:59,012
it's time I rejoined
the Great Link.

1054
00:57:08,972 --> 00:57:13,676
This is a moment worth savoring.

1055
00:57:15,518 --> 00:57:16,952
To victory...

1056
00:57:18,558 --> 00:57:20,391
hard fought

1057
00:57:20,428 --> 00:57:22,261
and well earned.

1058
00:57:28,911 --> 00:57:30,574
What's wrong?

1059
00:57:30,615 --> 00:57:33,108
Suddenly, I'm not thirsty.

1060
00:57:33,154 --> 00:57:35,647
Neither am I.

1061
00:57:37,028 --> 00:57:39,328
Before you waste too many tears

1062
00:57:39,366 --> 00:57:41,997
remember...
these are Cardassians

1063
00:57:42,038 --> 00:57:44,508
lying dead at your feet.

1064
00:57:44,543 --> 00:57:46,877
Bajorans would call this...

1065
00:57:46,914 --> 00:57:48,850
poetic justice.

1066
00:57:48,885 --> 00:57:53,486
That doesn't mean I have to
drink a toast over their bodies.

1067
00:58:07,088 --> 00:58:08,215
Humans...

1068
00:58:18,444 --> 00:58:21,075
800 million dead.

1069
00:58:21,116 --> 00:58:24,611
And casualty reports
still coming in.

1070
00:58:26,727 --> 00:58:29,756
Well, aren't you going
to congratulate me, Doctor?

1071
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:32,270
My exile is now officially over.

1072
00:58:32,305 --> 00:58:35,368
I've returned home...

1073
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:37,438
or rather, to what's left of it.

1074
00:58:37,482 --> 00:58:41,445
Listen, I-I know
that this must seem...

1075
00:58:41,490 --> 00:58:42,958
You know, some may say

1076
00:58:42,993 --> 00:58:45,361
that we've gotten
just what we deserved.

1077
00:58:45,398 --> 00:58:48,165
After all, we're not
entirely innocent, are we?

1078
00:58:48,204 --> 00:58:51,699
And I'm not just speaking
of the Bajoran occupation.

1079
00:58:51,744 --> 00:58:56,584
No, our whole history is
one of arrogant aggression.

1080
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:57,986
We've collaborated
with the Dominion

1081
00:58:58,023 --> 00:59:01,189
betrayed
the entire Alpha Quadrant.

1082
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:04,202
Oh, no, no,
there's no doubt about it.

1083
00:59:04,236 --> 00:59:07,402
We're guilty as charged.

1084
00:59:09,011 --> 00:59:11,379
You and I both know
that the Cardassians

1085
00:59:11,417 --> 00:59:12,715
are a strong people.

1086
00:59:12,752 --> 00:59:13,720
They'll survive.

1087
00:59:13,754 --> 00:59:15,587
Cardassia will survive.

1088
00:59:15,625 --> 00:59:17,219
Oh, please, Doctor.

1089
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:21,202
Spare me your insufferable
Federation optimism.

1090
00:59:21,236 --> 00:59:23,172
Of course, it'll survive...

1091
00:59:23,207 --> 00:59:26,077
but not
as the Cardassia I knew.

1092
00:59:26,113 --> 00:59:29,678
We had a rich
and ancient culture.

1093
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:33,990
Our literature, music,
art was second to none.

1094
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:36,693
And now...

1095
00:59:36,734 --> 00:59:38,863
so much of it is...

1096
00:59:38,904 --> 00:59:40,236
Lost.

1097
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:45,145
So many of our best people...

1098
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:50,022
our most gifted minds...

1099
00:59:52,565 --> 00:59:54,033
I'm sorry, Garak.

1100
00:59:54,068 --> 00:59:55,536
I didn't mean...

1101
00:59:55,571 --> 00:59:58,475
Oh, it's... it's quite
all right, Doctor.

1102
01:00:02,285 --> 01:00:05,587
You've been such a good friend.

1103
01:00:05,625 --> 01:00:07,993
I'm going to miss
our lunches together.

1104
01:00:08,029 --> 01:00:10,329
I'm sure we'll see
each other again.

1105
01:00:10,368 --> 01:00:12,838
I'd like to think so.

1106
01:00:12,872 --> 01:00:15,503
But one can never say.

1107
01:00:17,515 --> 01:00:20,544
We live in uncertain times.

1108
01:00:43,968 --> 01:00:48,033
The war between the Dominion
and the Federation Alliance

1109
01:00:48,076 --> 01:00:50,741
is now over.

1110
01:00:52,318 --> 01:00:54,881
400 years ago,
a victorious general

1111
01:00:54,923 --> 01:00:56,289
spoke the following words

1112
01:00:56,326 --> 01:00:58,091
at the end
of another costly war:

1113
01:00:58,129 --> 01:01:01,397
"Today the guns are silent.

1114
01:01:01,436 --> 01:01:03,269
"A great tragedy has ended.

1115
01:01:03,307 --> 01:01:05,777
"We have known
the bitterness of defeat

1116
01:01:05,811 --> 01:01:07,838
"and the exultation of triumph

1117
01:01:07,882 --> 01:01:13,120
"and from both we have learned
there can be no going back.

1118
01:01:13,227 --> 01:01:16,860
"We must move forward

1119
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:19,667
to preserve in peace
what we've won in war."

1120
01:01:28,791 --> 01:01:31,261
It's up to you now, Odo.

1121
01:01:38,142 --> 01:01:39,975
You're coming to Vic's
tonight, right?

1122
01:01:40,013 --> 01:01:41,106
I will be there.

1123
01:01:41,148 --> 01:01:43,516
But I will not dance.

1124
01:01:43,554 --> 01:01:44,886
Who's asking?

1125
01:01:44,923 --> 01:01:45,891
Commander Worf.

1126
01:01:45,925 --> 01:01:46,893
Captain.

1127
01:01:46,927 --> 01:01:48,190
Can you spare a moment?

1128
01:01:48,297 --> 01:01:49,560
Yes, sir.

1129
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:52,833
We've been discussing
your plans for the future.

1130
01:01:52,872 --> 01:01:56,367
I was not aware I had any plans.

1131
01:01:56,413 --> 01:01:59,214
Commander, how would you feel
about being named

1132
01:01:59,252 --> 01:02:01,188
Federation Ambassador to Kronos?

1133
01:02:01,223 --> 01:02:03,523
I am not a diplomat.

1134
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:06,327
And I am not a politician

1135
01:02:06,366 --> 01:02:11,104
but sometimes fate plays
cruel tricks on us, Worf.

1136
01:02:11,142 --> 01:02:13,909
Come.
Kronos needs you.

1137
01:02:13,947 --> 01:02:15,176
And what's more, I need you.

1138
01:02:18,089 --> 01:02:19,922
You helped him
become Chancellor.

1139
01:02:19,959 --> 01:02:22,429
Can't very well
turn your back on him now.

1140
01:02:24,969 --> 01:02:27,566
Well, my first loyalty
is to you, Captain.

1141
01:02:27,608 --> 01:02:29,578
Thank you, Mr. Worf.

1142
01:02:29,612 --> 01:02:31,548
I'll probably regret this
in the morning

1143
01:02:31,583 --> 01:02:33,382
but, if it's what you want...

1144
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:35,413
then by all means.

1145
01:02:39,332 --> 01:02:42,122
It has been a great honor
serving with you.

1146
01:02:42,254 --> 01:02:44,087
The honor is mine.

1147
01:02:45,528 --> 01:02:47,498
I accept.

1148
01:02:47,532 --> 01:02:49,593
Excellent.

1149
01:02:51,206 --> 01:02:54,201
An ambassador who'll go
<i>targ</i> hunting with me.

1150
01:02:56,249 --> 01:03:00,519
Well... perhaps being Chancellor
won't be so bad after all.

1151
01:03:00,558 --> 01:03:02,551
Congratulations, Worf.

1152
01:03:08,106 --> 01:03:09,871
When will you be going?

1153
01:03:10,878 --> 01:03:13,850
Soon.

1154
01:03:13,884 --> 01:03:15,820
You could come back, you know...

1155
01:03:15,855 --> 01:03:17,950
once you've cured your people.

1156
01:03:19,396 --> 01:03:20,887
I could.

1157
01:03:22,702 --> 01:03:25,902
But you're not going to do that.

1158
01:03:25,942 --> 01:03:27,935
Nerys...

1159
01:03:31,987 --> 01:03:36,691
you know my feelings for you
will never change...

1160
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:40,966
but I have to do this.

1161
01:03:41,005 --> 01:03:44,205
My people need me.

1162
01:03:44,245 --> 01:03:46,808
They need to know what I know

1163
01:03:46,850 --> 01:03:51,188
to learn what I've learned...

1164
01:03:51,225 --> 01:03:53,593
from living among solids.

1165
01:03:55,133 --> 01:03:58,333
It's the only way they'll
ever learn to trust you.

1166
01:03:58,374 --> 01:04:02,144
You don't have to justify
your decision, Odo.

1167
01:04:04,118 --> 01:04:05,712
There's just one thing...

1168
01:04:05,755 --> 01:04:07,588
Anything.

1169
01:04:07,625 --> 01:04:12,032
I'd like to take you
back to your homeworld.

1170
01:04:13,604 --> 01:04:15,597
I'd like that.

1171
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:19,105
I'd like that very much.

1172
01:04:21,453 --> 01:04:23,719
Hey... pally.

1173
01:04:23,758 --> 01:04:25,694
If you're here for
another game of "Go Fish"

1174
01:04:25,728 --> 01:04:26,957
I'm a little busy right now.

1175
01:04:26,997 --> 01:04:29,365
Actually, I'm here
for the "End of the war,

1176
01:04:29,403 --> 01:04:31,873
"good-bye to Chief O'Brien,
good-bye to Odo

1177
01:04:31,907 --> 01:04:33,877
good-bye to Worf party."

1178
01:04:33,911 --> 01:04:35,277
At the bar.

1179
01:04:36,517 --> 01:04:38,008
No, seriously, Miles.

1180
01:04:38,052 --> 01:04:39,520
You know, I envy you...

1181
01:04:39,556 --> 01:04:40,854
going back to Earth...

1182
01:04:40,892 --> 01:04:42,452
chance to enjoy paradise again.

1183
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:44,362
Any idea where
you're going to live?

1184
01:04:44,399 --> 01:04:45,765
No, Keiko and I are

1185
01:04:45,802 --> 01:04:47,829
still mulling over
a few possibilities.

1186
01:04:47,872 --> 01:04:49,238
Have you ever considered Minsk?

1187
01:04:49,275 --> 01:04:51,074
I don't think
that's on our list.

1188
01:04:51,112 --> 01:04:52,775
New Orleans is a gorgeous city.

1189
01:04:52,816 --> 01:04:55,013
I've heard great things
about Paris.

1190
01:04:55,053 --> 01:04:56,920
Minsk.

1191
01:04:56,957 --> 01:04:58,357
Jadzia loved Rio.

1192
01:04:58,393 --> 01:05:00,886
Well, you've certainly
got a lot of choices.

1193
01:05:00,932 --> 01:05:02,264
Yeah. Too many, hmm?

1194
01:05:02,301 --> 01:05:03,394
Minsk.

1195
01:05:03,437 --> 01:05:04,997
Well, wherever you decide to go

1196
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:07,739
I'm sure that you and Keiko
will both be very happy.

1197
01:05:07,779 --> 01:05:10,410
Listen, Julian, I know Earth
isn't exactly around the corner

1198
01:05:10,451 --> 01:05:11,885
but I still expect you to visit.

1199
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:12,910
I intend to.

1200
01:05:12,956 --> 01:05:14,516
Yeah.

1201
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:16,893
You and me, take
a little trip to Texas.

1202
01:05:16,930 --> 01:05:19,264
Standing side by side
in front of the Alamo.

1203
01:05:19,301 --> 01:05:20,964
The real Alamo, hmm?

1204
01:05:21,005 --> 01:05:22,439
See?
It's going to be great.

1205
01:05:22,475 --> 01:05:23,807
Absolutely.

1206
01:05:23,844 --> 01:05:25,404
I don't see how great
it would be.

1207
01:05:25,448 --> 01:05:29,047
Earth's nothing more than
a rotating ball of boredom.

1208
01:05:29,088 --> 01:05:32,390
If you ask me, you'd be
better off staying here.

1209
01:05:32,427 --> 01:05:34,363
And that goes for you
and Worf and well.

1210
01:05:34,398 --> 01:05:36,664
Don't tell me you're
getting sentimental, Quark.

1211
01:05:36,703 --> 01:05:38,263
Me?

1212
01:05:38,306 --> 01:05:40,572
Not a chance.

1213
01:05:40,611 --> 01:05:42,740
I just don't like change.

1214
01:05:42,782 --> 01:05:43,841
You better get used to it.

1215
01:05:43,884 --> 01:05:44,852
Things are going to be

1216
01:05:44,886 --> 01:05:46,286
pretty different
around here now.

1217
01:05:49,361 --> 01:05:54,360
To the best crew
any Captain ever had.

1218
01:05:54,405 --> 01:05:57,036
This may be the last time
we're all together...

1219
01:05:57,077 --> 01:06:00,015
but no matter what
the future holds...

1220
01:06:00,050 --> 01:06:04,514
no matter how far we travel,
a part of us...

1221
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:06,495
a very important part...

1222
01:06:06,530 --> 01:06:09,127
will always remain here...

1223
01:06:09,201 --> 01:06:11,467
on Deep Space 9.

1224
01:06:11,506 --> 01:06:12,838
- Hear, hear!
- Cheers.

1225
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:20,154
Ladies and gentlemen

1226
01:06:20,256 --> 01:06:23,023
tonight is a very special night
for some friends of mine.

1227
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:24,725
They've been together
a long time.

1228
01:06:26,903 --> 01:06:29,135
But like the man said

1229
01:06:29,174 --> 01:06:31,440
"Nothing lasts forever."

1230
01:06:31,479 --> 01:06:32,447
So, gang...

1231
01:06:32,481 --> 01:06:35,612
this one's from the heart.

1232
01:06:35,655 --> 01:06:39,561
Someday

1233
01:06:39,596 --> 01:06:44,402
When I'm awfully low

1234
01:06:44,438 --> 01:06:49,608
When the world is cold

1235
01:06:49,649 --> 01:06:57,621
I will feel a glow
just thinking of you

1236
01:06:59,803 --> 01:07:05,212
And the way you look tonight

1237
01:07:08,987 --> 01:07:14,659
You are lovely

1238
01:07:14,699 --> 01:07:20,142
With your smile so warm

1239
01:07:20,176 --> 01:07:25,209
And your cheeks so soft

1240
01:07:25,253 --> 01:07:33,464
There is nothing for me
but to love you

1241
01:07:35,273 --> 01:07:38,906
Just the way you look

1242
01:07:38,947 --> 01:07:40,974
Tonight

1243
01:07:45,828 --> 01:07:49,632
With each word

1244
01:07:49,669 --> 01:07:53,666
Your tenderness grows

1245
01:07:55,681 --> 01:07:58,151
Tearing my fear

1246
01:07:59,722 --> 01:08:03,560
Apart

1247
01:08:05,734 --> 01:08:10,232
And that laugh

1248
01:08:10,276 --> 01:08:13,771
That wrinkles your nose

1249
01:08:15,855 --> 01:08:19,021
Touches my

1250
01:08:19,061 --> 01:08:20,495
Foolish heart

1251
01:08:26,041 --> 01:08:28,477
Someday

1252
01:08:30,383 --> 01:08:33,914
When I'm awfully low

1253
01:08:36,161 --> 01:08:41,297
When the world is cold

1254
01:08:41,405 --> 01:08:44,502
I will feel a glow

1255
01:08:44,544 --> 01:08:49,282
Just thinking of you

1256
01:08:50,925 --> 01:08:57,268
And the way you look

1257
01:08:57,304 --> 01:09:04,444
Tonight.

1258
01:09:15,273 --> 01:09:18,404
<i>Dorrah tolka bretri Pah-wran.</i>

1259
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:21,509
Kosst Amojan, come to me.

1260
01:09:21,552 --> 01:09:24,022
I await you.

1261
01:09:55,257 --> 01:09:56,748
No!

1262
01:10:10,254 --> 01:10:12,451
Ben, what's wrong?

1263
01:10:12,491 --> 01:10:15,327
I understand now.

1264
01:10:15,364 --> 01:10:17,231
Understand what?

1265
01:10:17,268 --> 01:10:19,761
What I have to do.
What I was meant to do.

1266
01:10:19,806 --> 01:10:22,835
Kasidy, I have to go.

1267
01:10:22,879 --> 01:10:24,040
Go where?

1268
01:10:24,148 --> 01:10:26,050
To Bajor, to the fire caves.

1269
01:10:26,152 --> 01:10:27,245
I'll go with you.

1270
01:10:27,288 --> 01:10:28,779
No...

1271
01:10:28,824 --> 01:10:31,056
I have to do this alone.

1272
01:10:45,490 --> 01:10:49,931
Did you really think
the Pah-wraiths would choose you

1273
01:10:49,967 --> 01:10:52,962
as their Emissary?

1274
01:10:56,914 --> 01:11:02,050
Soon the Pah-wraiths
will burn across Bajor...

1275
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:04,654
the Celestial Temple...

1276
01:11:04,695 --> 01:11:07,292
the Alpha Quadrant.

1277
01:11:07,334 --> 01:11:09,634
Can you picture it?

1278
01:11:09,672 --> 01:11:12,610
An entire universe...

1279
01:11:12,645 --> 01:11:14,740
set in flames...

1280
01:11:14,783 --> 01:11:18,951
to burn for all eternity.

1281
01:11:22,631 --> 01:11:26,001
The Prophets have sent me
a gift.

1282
01:11:28,143 --> 01:11:31,638
Their beloved Emissary
sent forth

1283
01:11:31,683 --> 01:11:34,119
like an avenging angel

1284
01:11:34,155 --> 01:11:36,557
to slay the demon.

1285
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:39,062
I should have known
the demon would be you.

1286
01:11:39,098 --> 01:11:40,396
Go on...

1287
01:11:40,434 --> 01:11:43,235
kill me if you can.

1288
01:11:47,748 --> 01:11:51,688
You'll have to do
better than that, Captain.

1289
01:11:57,301 --> 01:11:59,430
It's just too easy.

1290
01:12:01,042 --> 01:12:02,340
That's it.

1291
01:12:02,377 --> 01:12:04,540
Come closer. That's it.

1292
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:15,629
Now bow to me.

1293
01:12:17,674 --> 01:12:20,202
I said bow.

1294
01:12:26,092 --> 01:12:28,585
You are pathetic.

1295
01:12:28,630 --> 01:12:31,066
Then why are you
the one on your knees?

1296
01:12:31,102 --> 01:12:34,336
First the Dominion,
now the Pah-wraiths.

1297
01:12:34,375 --> 01:12:38,008
You have a talent
for picking the losing sides.

1298
01:12:38,049 --> 01:12:42,684
Benjamin, please, we've
know each other too long.

1299
01:12:42,724 --> 01:12:46,391
And since this is the last time
we will ever be together

1300
01:12:46,432 --> 01:12:48,664
let's try to speak honestly.

1301
01:12:48,703 --> 01:12:52,541
We've both had our victories
and our defeats.

1302
01:12:52,578 --> 01:12:55,345
Now it's time
to resolve our differences

1303
01:12:55,383 --> 01:12:57,717
and face the ultimate truth.

1304
01:12:57,754 --> 01:13:00,817
I've won, Benjamin.

1305
01:13:00,861 --> 01:13:03,833
You've lost.

1306
01:13:03,867 --> 01:13:07,705
The Pah-wraiths
will never conquer anything...

1307
01:13:07,741 --> 01:13:09,904
not Bajor...

1308
01:13:09,946 --> 01:13:11,711
not the Celestial Temple

1309
01:13:11,749 --> 01:13:14,550
and certainly
not the Alpha Quadrant.

1310
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:17,991
And who's going to stop us?

1311
01:13:18,029 --> 01:13:19,497
I am!

1312
01:13:23,273 --> 01:13:26,211
You can't even stand up.

1313
01:13:26,245 --> 01:13:28,408
Then I'll stop you.

1314
01:13:36,632 --> 01:13:39,229
Are you still here?

1315
01:13:39,271 --> 01:13:41,241
Emissary

1316
01:13:41,309 --> 01:13:42,299
the book!

1317
01:13:52,297 --> 01:13:54,631
Farewell, Adami.

1318
01:14:11,102 --> 01:14:12,468
Sarah?

1319
01:14:13,974 --> 01:14:15,705
Are you here?

1320
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:18,706
What happened?

1321
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:22,189
The Emissary has
completed his task.

1322
01:14:22,224 --> 01:14:23,214
But the Pah-wraiths...

1323
01:14:23,259 --> 01:14:25,992
You've returned them
to their prison

1324
01:14:26,032 --> 01:14:27,763
within the fire caves.

1325
01:14:27,801 --> 01:14:30,203
The book was the key,
wasn't it?

1326
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:33,805
To a door that can
never be opened again.

1327
01:14:33,846 --> 01:14:36,009
And Dukat... is he dead?

1328
01:14:36,052 --> 01:14:38,545
He's where he belongs...

1329
01:14:38,589 --> 01:14:40,491
with the Pah-wraiths.

1330
01:14:42,697 --> 01:14:46,398
Your time of trial has ended.

1331
01:14:46,439 --> 01:14:48,932
You need to rest now.

1332
01:14:48,976 --> 01:14:51,777
Oh, I intend to

1333
01:14:51,816 --> 01:14:55,152
as soon as I return
to Deep Space 9.

1334
01:14:56,425 --> 01:14:58,588
That won't be necessary.

1335
01:15:02,971 --> 01:15:05,602
You're with us now.

1336
01:15:16,612 --> 01:15:19,277
We found the Captain's runabout
orbiting Bajor.

1337
01:15:19,318 --> 01:15:20,809
But when we scanned
the fire caves

1338
01:15:20,854 --> 01:15:22,322
there was no sign of him.

1339
01:15:22,357 --> 01:15:24,452
Tarkalian tea.
Soothing.

1340
01:15:24,495 --> 01:15:26,055
Better keep it coming.

1341
01:15:26,098 --> 01:15:28,330
You're not calling off
the search yet, are you?

1342
01:15:28,403 --> 01:15:30,532
Not until we find your father.

1343
01:15:32,244 --> 01:15:34,237
What about the Kendra Province...

1344
01:15:34,281 --> 01:15:36,046
where he bought that land?

1345
01:15:36,085 --> 01:15:38,613
Maybe he went there
for some reason.

1346
01:15:38,656 --> 01:15:40,523
Colonel Kira and Chief O'Brien

1347
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:42,962
have completed another
scan of the planet.

1348
01:15:42,998 --> 01:15:45,936
As far as they can
tell, he is not there.

1349
01:15:45,971 --> 01:15:48,772
Something's happened to Ben...

1350
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:50,039
something bad.

1351
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,378
I can feel it.

1352
01:15:53,319 --> 01:15:54,982
The Prophets warned us.

1353
01:15:58,296 --> 01:16:00,232
Hello?

1354
01:16:00,267 --> 01:16:02,635
Is anyone here?

1355
01:16:05,343 --> 01:16:08,782
Ben? Is that you?

1356
01:16:08,816 --> 01:16:10,445
Kasidy...

1357
01:16:10,487 --> 01:16:12,116
Oh, Ben.

1358
01:16:14,828 --> 01:16:17,391
Oh, I've been
so worried about you.

1359
01:16:19,371 --> 01:16:21,273
Where are we?

1360
01:16:21,309 --> 01:16:23,940
The Celestial Temple.

1361
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:27,248
This is scaring me.

1362
01:16:27,287 --> 01:16:29,655
Let's go home.

1363
01:16:29,692 --> 01:16:32,493
I can't. Not now.

1364
01:16:32,531 --> 01:16:34,728
Why not?

1365
01:16:38,242 --> 01:16:40,337
Oh, God.

1366
01:16:42,918 --> 01:16:45,890
This is it, isn't it?

1367
01:16:49,164 --> 01:16:52,432
The sorrow that the Prophets
warned us about.

1368
01:16:57,614 --> 01:17:00,279
It's difficult to explain.

1369
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:02,552
It's not linear.

1370
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:05,290
What isn't?

1371
01:17:05,330 --> 01:17:07,323
My life...

1372
01:17:07,367 --> 01:17:10,032
my destiny...

1373
01:17:10,072 --> 01:17:13,637
The Prophets saved me, Kasidy.

1374
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:16,014
I'm their Emissary

1375
01:17:16,051 --> 01:17:21,119
and they still have
a great deal for me to do.

1376
01:17:21,162 --> 01:17:23,325
But first...

1377
01:17:23,366 --> 01:17:25,894
there is much to learn...

1378
01:17:25,937 --> 01:17:30,675
things only the Prophets
can teach me.

1379
01:17:30,714 --> 01:17:33,481
When will you be back?

1380
01:17:34,488 --> 01:17:35,683
It's hard to say.

1381
01:17:37,627 --> 01:17:39,756
Maybe a year...

1382
01:17:39,798 --> 01:17:42,098
maybe...

1383
01:17:42,136 --> 01:17:43,468
yesterday.

1384
01:17:45,042 --> 01:17:47,444
But I will be back.

1385
01:17:49,284 --> 01:17:51,881
And I will be waiting.

1386
01:17:56,632 --> 01:17:59,570
Kas, can you hear me?

1387
01:18:02,844 --> 01:18:05,714
You seemed pretty
far away for a second.

1388
01:18:07,988 --> 01:18:10,458
I was talking to your father.

1389
01:21:59,851 --> 01:22:01,753
Are you sure you want to leave
without saying good-bye?

1390
01:22:01,788 --> 01:22:04,385
I'm sure. I've never
been good at good-byes.

1391
01:22:04,427 --> 01:22:06,192
There are going
to be a lot of people

1392
01:22:06,230 --> 01:22:07,289
that are disappointed.

1393
01:22:07,332 --> 01:22:09,632
If they don't know
how I feel about them now

1394
01:22:09,671 --> 01:22:12,107
a few parting words won't
make the difference.

1395
01:22:12,142 --> 01:22:13,633
Aha! I knew it.

1396
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:15,045
When I saw
the two of you slip out

1397
01:22:15,081 --> 01:22:16,344
I said to myself

1398
01:22:16,384 --> 01:22:20,194
"That no-good, misanthropic

1399
01:22:20,327 --> 01:22:21,488
"cantankerous changeling
is trying

1400
01:22:21,530 --> 01:22:24,161
to sneak off the station
without anyone noticing."

1401
01:22:24,202 --> 01:22:25,728
That was the idea.

1402
01:22:25,772 --> 01:22:27,240
Well, it's not going
to happen, is it?

1403
01:22:27,275 --> 01:22:28,938
Apparently not.

1404
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:31,643
So...

1405
01:22:31,684 --> 01:22:34,383
now that I'm here...

1406
01:22:36,961 --> 01:22:39,431
is there something
you want to say to me?

1407
01:22:39,466 --> 01:22:41,197
Such as?

1408
01:22:41,236 --> 01:22:43,706
Such as...

1409
01:22:43,741 --> 01:22:47,704
"Good-bye. You certainly were
a worthy adversary."

1410
01:22:47,749 --> 01:22:49,412
Or maybe something

1411
01:22:49,452 --> 01:22:52,583
with the words
"mutual respect" in it.

1412
01:22:52,659 --> 01:22:54,288
No.

1413
01:22:54,329 --> 01:22:56,595
No? What do you mean, no?

1414
01:22:56,634 --> 01:22:58,000
I mean no.

1415
01:22:58,036 --> 01:23:00,974
I have nothing
I want to say to you.

1416
01:23:01,009 --> 01:23:03,002
Are you telling me
that after all these years

1417
01:23:03,046 --> 01:23:04,309
after all we've been through

1418
01:23:04,349 --> 01:23:06,285
you're not even going
to say good-bye to me?

1419
01:23:06,319 --> 01:23:08,346
That's right.

1420
01:23:09,793 --> 01:23:12,924
Nerys... I'll be
on the runabout.

1421
01:23:19,613 --> 01:23:21,310
Don't take it hard, Quark.

1422
01:23:21,349 --> 01:23:22,943
Hard?

1423
01:23:22,986 --> 01:23:24,546
What are you talking about?

1424
01:23:24,590 --> 01:23:26,389
That man loves me.

1425
01:23:26,426 --> 01:23:27,894
Couldn't you see?

1426
01:23:27,929 --> 01:23:30,867
It was written
all over his back.

1427
01:24:12,218 --> 01:24:14,518
The Link...

1428
01:24:14,556 --> 01:24:16,287
it's so different.

1429
01:24:18,129 --> 01:24:20,497
They're dying.

1430
01:24:20,534 --> 01:24:23,199
You should go to them.

1431
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:24,299
Yes.

1432
01:24:27,281 --> 01:24:29,444
Nerys...

1433
01:24:29,485 --> 01:24:33,050
please, tell everyone
I'll miss them.

1434
01:24:33,093 --> 01:24:35,222
Even Quark?

1435
01:24:35,264 --> 01:24:38,236
Even Quark.

1436
01:24:38,270 --> 01:24:40,137
But most of all...

1437
01:24:42,946 --> 01:24:45,007
I know.

1438
01:25:15,143 --> 01:25:16,908
Odo...

1439
01:25:16,947 --> 01:25:19,885
You always said
I looked good in a tuxedo.

1440
01:25:21,924 --> 01:25:23,415
You do.

1441
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:26,694
Then this is the way
I want you to remember me.

1442
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:30,136
I'll never forget you.

1443
01:25:35,985 --> 01:25:38,251
Good-bye, Nerys.

1444
01:26:24,482 --> 01:26:26,008
The duty roster, Colonel.

1445
01:26:28,089 --> 01:26:29,057
Nice work.

1446
01:26:29,091 --> 01:26:31,892
Congratulations
on your promotion, Lieutenant.

1447
01:26:31,930 --> 01:26:34,093
Thank you, sir.

1448
01:26:34,135 --> 01:26:36,766
I guess putting me in
for a promotion

1449
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:39,971
was one of Captain Sisko's
last official acts.

1450
01:26:40,013 --> 01:26:41,983
I'm sure he's very proud
of you, Nog.

1451
01:26:43,153 --> 01:26:45,055
I'd like to think so, sir.

1452
01:26:45,090 --> 01:26:47,891
Now, about the cargo
inventories...

1453
01:26:47,929 --> 01:26:49,956
I'll get right on it.

1454
01:27:16,252 --> 01:27:18,586
...you know, the thing is,
the apoptosis is really

1455
01:27:18,623 --> 01:27:20,957
just part of the normal
cardiac renewal process.

1456
01:27:20,995 --> 01:27:22,555
What do you think?

1457
01:27:22,598 --> 01:27:24,329
I think that
after dinner tonight

1458
01:27:24,368 --> 01:27:25,631
we should go to Quark's

1459
01:27:25,670 --> 01:27:27,002
spend some time
in the holosuite.

1460
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:28,907
Oh... I'd like a trip to Vegas.

1461
01:27:28,944 --> 01:27:31,472
Actually, I was thinking
about the Alamo.

1462
01:27:31,515 --> 01:27:32,983
We can't go there.

1463
01:27:33,019 --> 01:27:33,987
Why not?

1464
01:27:34,021 --> 01:27:36,287
Because that's what
Miles and I... did.

1465
01:27:36,325 --> 01:27:38,261
But I do have a new program...

1466
01:27:38,296 --> 01:27:39,959
the Battle of Thermopylae.

1467
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:40,968
Do you know it?

1468
01:27:41,002 --> 01:27:43,199
Well, it's about
a force of Spartans

1469
01:27:43,239 --> 01:27:44,707
led by King Leonidas

1470
01:27:44,742 --> 01:27:48,773
who defend a mountain pass
against a vast army of Persians.

1471
01:27:48,817 --> 01:27:50,616
What happens then?

1472
01:27:50,654 --> 01:27:51,781
Well, for two days

1473
01:27:51,823 --> 01:27:54,089
the Spartans lead
a heroic struggle.

1474
01:27:54,128 --> 01:27:56,064
Until they're wiped out.

1475
01:27:56,098 --> 01:27:57,157
Yes.

1476
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:58,327
How'd you know?

1477
01:27:58,369 --> 01:27:59,462
Lucky guess.

1478
01:27:59,505 --> 01:28:00,700
I take it we'll be the Spartans.

1479
01:28:00,740 --> 01:28:02,437
Fighting to the last man.

1480
01:28:02,477 --> 01:28:04,538
Just like the Alamo.

1481
01:28:04,581 --> 01:28:06,175
Exactly.

1482
01:28:06,218 --> 01:28:08,279
Have you talked to a Counselor

1483
01:28:08,323 --> 01:28:10,759
about these
annihilation fantasies?

1484
01:28:10,795 --> 01:28:12,526
Do you think I should?

1485
01:28:12,564 --> 01:28:15,365
Mm-hmm. I'll set up a
session for you tomorrow.

1486
01:28:15,403 --> 01:28:16,803
What about tonight?

1487
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:18,639
Tonight, we defend the pass.

1488
01:28:20,447 --> 01:28:21,415
Don't worry.

1489
01:28:21,449 --> 01:28:23,476
It's guaranteed
to grow hair within a week

1490
01:28:23,519 --> 01:28:24,851
though if you ask me...

1491
01:28:24,923 --> 01:28:26,859
that dome of yours
is hairy enough.

1492
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:29,693
Besides, hasn't there
been enough change

1493
01:28:29,732 --> 01:28:31,200
around here already?

1494
01:28:33,506 --> 01:28:34,633
Quark!

1495
01:28:37,047 --> 01:28:39,347
You mind explaining this?

1496
01:28:39,385 --> 01:28:42,824
Oh, uh, that's, um...

1497
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:45,056
this week's betting pool.

1498
01:28:45,096 --> 01:28:46,064
You're taking bets

1499
01:28:46,098 --> 01:28:47,396
on who's going
to be the new Kai?

1500
01:28:47,434 --> 01:28:49,131
It's a wide open field.

1501
01:28:49,171 --> 01:28:51,266
Just between you and me

1502
01:28:51,308 --> 01:28:53,676
the smart money
is on Vedek Ungtae.

1503
01:28:53,713 --> 01:28:56,310
Ah... well, just
between you and me

1504
01:28:56,352 --> 01:28:57,581
all bets are off.

1505
01:28:57,621 --> 01:28:58,611
What are you talking about?

1506
01:28:58,656 --> 01:29:01,024
As of this moment,
betting pools of any kind

1507
01:29:01,062 --> 01:29:02,827
are illegal on this station.

1508
01:29:02,865 --> 01:29:04,197
I catch someone placing a bet

1509
01:29:04,234 --> 01:29:06,500
I put you in a holding cell
for 15 days.

1510
01:29:06,539 --> 01:29:07,507
Is that clear?

1511
01:29:07,541 --> 01:29:09,170
15 days?

1512
01:29:09,211 --> 01:29:10,611
Can I bring my own pillow?

1513
01:29:10,647 --> 01:29:12,047
Quark...

1514
01:29:12,084 --> 01:29:13,678
It's clear, it's clear.

1515
01:29:14,755 --> 01:29:16,087
Better be.

1516
01:29:26,980 --> 01:29:30,384
It's like I said...

1517
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:35,556
the more things change,
the more they stay the same.
