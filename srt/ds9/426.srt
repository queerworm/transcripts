1
00:00:05,235 --> 00:00:07,535
You wanted to see me, Garak?

2
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:08,701
Ah! Constable.

3
00:00:08,743 --> 00:00:11,009
How good of you to stop by.

4
00:00:12,182 --> 00:00:13,913
A shoplifter?

5
00:00:13,953 --> 00:00:15,684
Excuse me?

6
00:00:15,723 --> 00:00:18,057
Is something wrong?

7
00:00:18,094 --> 00:00:20,360
Here I come.

8
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:21,697
What do you think?

9
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:28,212
"A thing of beauty
is a joy forever."

10
00:00:28,315 --> 00:00:31,219
Oh, well, then
put it on my account.

11
00:00:31,254 --> 00:00:32,654
I'll wear it to work.

12
00:00:32,691 --> 00:00:33,784
A splendid idea.

13
00:00:36,397 --> 00:00:38,128
Ah. Security Chief Odo

14
00:00:38,168 --> 00:00:40,765
I'd like to introduce you
to Chalan Aroya...

15
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:42,640
one of my best customers.

16
00:00:44,815 --> 00:00:46,648
I own the Celestial Cafe...

17
00:00:46,685 --> 00:00:49,919
the new Bajoran restaurant
overlooking the Promenade.

18
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:52,428
I-I'm familiar with it.

19
00:00:55,703 --> 00:00:58,266
I watch you walk by
every morning

20
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,005
when you're on patrol.

21
00:01:00,045 --> 00:01:02,447
0937.

22
00:01:02,483 --> 00:01:04,851
You're very precise.

23
00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:10,698
How... nice of you to notice.

24
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:13,728
I was hoping
one day you might stop in

25
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:15,436
when you're not working.

26
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:19,381
Uh... I don't eat.

27
00:01:19,417 --> 00:01:20,851
I do

28
00:01:20,887 --> 00:01:23,153
and I hate to eat alone.

29
00:01:24,594 --> 00:01:26,655
Think about it.

30
00:01:30,272 --> 00:01:33,767
Oh, and next time you're
on the Second Level

31
00:01:33,813 --> 00:01:36,306
don't forget to say hello.

32
00:01:40,492 --> 00:01:42,621
The next time you call me

33
00:01:42,664 --> 00:01:45,295
it had better be
to report a crime.

34
00:01:45,335 --> 00:01:49,105
Now that you mention it,
I've just witnessed a crime.

35
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:53,481
Letting Aroya walk out of here
without arranging a date.

36
00:01:53,518 --> 00:01:55,579
You should be locked away
for that.

37
00:01:55,623 --> 00:01:57,991
You humanoids...
you're all obsessed

38
00:01:58,027 --> 00:02:00,463
with these convoluted
mating rituals.

39
00:02:00,499 --> 00:02:02,560
True, but do you think
we'd waste

40
00:02:02,603 --> 00:02:05,700
so much time on something
that wasn't worthwhile?

41
00:02:05,743 --> 00:02:07,372
I'll never understand you.

42
00:02:07,412 --> 00:02:09,279
You're such a sensitive man

43
00:02:09,316 --> 00:02:11,981
yet there are so many aspects
of humanoid life

44
00:02:12,022 --> 00:02:15,051
that you simply refuse
to explore.

45
00:02:15,095 --> 00:02:16,724
I have no desire

46
00:02:16,765 --> 00:02:19,965
to become a slave
to humanoid obsessions.

47
00:02:20,005 --> 00:02:21,770
But you have to admit

48
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,971
she is quite lovely.

49
00:02:26,217 --> 00:02:29,884
Well... she is, isn't she?

50
00:02:29,925 --> 00:02:31,052
Mm-hmm.

51
00:02:31,093 --> 00:02:32,220
Oh!

52
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,329
Odo!

53
00:02:35,368 --> 00:02:37,338
What's wrong?

54
00:02:37,406 --> 00:02:39,672
I... I don't know.

55
00:02:50,398 --> 00:02:51,832
Garak to Dr. Bashir.

56
00:02:51,868 --> 00:02:56,640
I need a medical emergency team
sent to my shop immediately.

57
00:04:54,513 --> 00:04:57,451
Doctor, this is a waste of time.

58
00:04:57,485 --> 00:04:59,648
You don't know enough
about changeling physiology

59
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:02,092
to diagnose what's wrong
with me, no one does.

60
00:05:02,128 --> 00:05:04,428
Actually, I do have
some idea what's going on.

61
00:05:04,499 --> 00:05:06,435
I've compared
your current medical scans

62
00:05:06,537 --> 00:05:08,028
with ones I made
over the last four years

63
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:10,101
and there are
some noticeable differences.

64
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:11,612
Normally, when you're
in humanoid form

65
00:05:11,647 --> 00:05:13,947
you have a specific
density of 1.4

66
00:05:13,986 --> 00:05:15,615
which is constant
throughout your body.

67
00:05:15,655 --> 00:05:18,456
Your mass and density only vary
when you change shape.

68
00:05:18,494 --> 00:05:21,660
Right now, your mass and density
are in a state of fluctuation.

69
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,963
Do you know what's causing it?

70
00:05:23,004 --> 00:05:23,972
No.

71
00:05:24,006 --> 00:05:25,338
Well, do you know
how to prevent it

72
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,365
from happening again?

73
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,378
Not yet.

74
00:05:27,412 --> 00:05:29,314
Well, then let me know
when you do.

75
00:05:29,349 --> 00:05:31,444
I'm afraid I can't
let you leave just yet.

76
00:05:31,487 --> 00:05:33,218
Moving seems to increase
the fluctuations

77
00:05:33,257 --> 00:05:35,056
and may bring on another attack.

78
00:05:35,094 --> 00:05:36,893
Are you saying
I have to stay here

79
00:05:36,932 --> 00:05:38,400
until you discover a cure?

80
00:05:38,434 --> 00:05:40,700
Or until the fluctuations
stop on their own.

81
00:05:40,738 --> 00:05:42,036
For all I know

82
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:43,977
this could be a normal
biological process...

83
00:05:44,012 --> 00:05:46,005
the changeling
equivalent of puberty...

84
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,747
or menopause.

85
00:05:47,786 --> 00:05:50,349
That's an interesting
theory, Doctor

86
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:53,522
one I suggest
that you keep to yourself.

87
00:05:53,564 --> 00:05:54,964
Don't worry.

88
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:57,233
This could just as easily
turn out to be a virus

89
00:05:57,272 --> 00:05:58,740
or a bacterial infection.

90
00:05:58,774 --> 00:06:01,678
Now, lie back, and I promise
I'll do everything I can

91
00:06:01,714 --> 00:06:03,741
to get you out of here
as soon as possible.

92
00:06:16,601 --> 00:06:18,434
We find the Federation's demands

93
00:06:18,505 --> 00:06:20,873
that we return
the captured Cardassian colonies

94
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,210
insulting and provocative.

95
00:06:23,248 --> 00:06:26,618
Klingon blood was spilled
to conquer those worlds.

96
00:06:26,654 --> 00:06:29,182
They are now part
of the Klingon Empire

97
00:06:29,226 --> 00:06:31,458
and we will never give them up.

98
00:06:31,531 --> 00:06:33,592
Furthermore, if the Federation

99
00:06:33,635 --> 00:06:36,573
still harbors any hope
of peaceful coexistence

100
00:06:36,607 --> 00:06:38,474
with the Klingon Empire

101
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:41,915
it must abandon all starbases
and military installations

102
00:06:41,952 --> 00:06:43,649
in the Archanis sector.

103
00:06:43,688 --> 00:06:49,291
Our claim to Archanis IV
and the surrounding territory

104
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,462
is ancient and indisputable.

105
00:06:51,504 --> 00:06:54,670
We advise the Federation
to leave Archanis

106
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,648
or prepare to face
the consequences.

107
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:59,448
Long live the Empire.

108
00:07:03,695 --> 00:07:06,326
This recording was sent
to the Federation Council

109
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:07,835
three days ago.

110
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,933
If Gowron is willing to go to
war over the Archanis sector

111
00:07:10,977 --> 00:07:13,915
then he has become even more
dangerous than I thought.

112
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:15,349
I don't get it.

113
00:07:15,385 --> 00:07:17,982
The Klingons relinquished
their claim to Archanis IV

114
00:07:18,024 --> 00:07:19,322
100 years ago.

115
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,193
I guess
they changed their mind.

116
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:24,293
I don't think Gowron
gives a damn about Archanis.

117
00:07:24,336 --> 00:07:27,069
He's just looking for an excuse
to rattle his saber.

118
00:07:27,109 --> 00:07:28,338
The question is why.

119
00:07:28,378 --> 00:07:31,248
Yesterday, I talked
to an old friend of Curzon's

120
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,083
from the diplomatic corps.

121
00:07:33,121 --> 00:07:34,988
She says that representatives

122
00:07:35,025 --> 00:07:37,929
from Federation worlds
near the Klingon border

123
00:07:37,964 --> 00:07:40,457
are already urging
a preemptive strike.

124
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,529
Sounds like war
may be inevitable.

125
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,541
I hope you're wrong, Major

126
00:07:44,643 --> 00:07:48,811
but right now, there's not much
we can do about it either way.

127
00:07:48,852 --> 00:07:52,724
Archanis IV
is a long way from here.

128
00:07:55,031 --> 00:07:57,058
Two, three...

129
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:59,368
I say she stops at seven.

130
00:07:59,406 --> 00:08:01,069
I say eight.
Mr. Worf?

131
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,376
Ten.

132
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:08,523
Oh, I hate being pregnant!

133
00:08:08,558 --> 00:08:09,685
I win.

134
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,893
My nose hasn't
stopped itching for weeks.

135
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:14,333
We've noticed.

136
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,171
Is there anything
Dr. Bashir can do about it?

137
00:08:17,209 --> 00:08:18,177
I'm Bajoran.

138
00:08:18,211 --> 00:08:20,181
Human women get nauseous...
we sneeze.

139
00:08:20,215 --> 00:08:23,085
Besides, I think Dr. Bashir's
hands are full right now.

140
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:24,214
How is the Constable?

141
00:08:24,256 --> 00:08:25,383
No news yet.

142
00:08:25,425 --> 00:08:28,261
I was thinking
about going to visit him.

143
00:08:28,298 --> 00:08:29,561
I doubt that he
would wish to be seen

144
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:31,033
in such a weakened state.

145
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,265
What if he wants
some company...

146
00:08:32,306 --> 00:08:33,797
someone to take his
mind off his problems?

147
00:08:33,841 --> 00:08:36,677
That is doubtful.
Odo values his privacy.

148
00:08:36,714 --> 00:08:39,345
He does not like
to... socialize.

149
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:40,854
I think it's all an act.

150
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:43,452
It is not an act.
He told me so himself.

151
00:08:43,494 --> 00:08:46,694
But you were socializing
with him when he said it.

152
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:50,299
Captain, was Dax's last host
as argumentative as this one?

153
00:08:50,342 --> 00:08:51,310
Worse.

154
00:08:51,344 --> 00:08:53,780
Thank you, Benjamin...
I think.

155
00:08:53,815 --> 00:08:56,217
Hopefully, Odo will get
back on his feet soon.

156
00:08:56,253 --> 00:08:59,248
In the meantime, I want him
left alone to rest. Agreed?

157
00:09:00,295 --> 00:09:01,285
Agreed.

158
00:09:15,325 --> 00:09:16,851
May I come in?

159
00:09:16,894 --> 00:09:21,232
If you're looking for Dr.
Bashir, he's not in right now.

160
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,536
Actually, I came to see you.

161
00:09:23,574 --> 00:09:25,237
To be honest, Major

162
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:28,273
I really don't feel like
company at the moment.

163
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,014
I didn't plan on staying.

164
00:09:30,054 --> 00:09:31,751
I just came to bring you this.

165
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:38,201
Today's criminal
activities report.

166
00:09:38,237 --> 00:09:40,730
I figured you might
be getting tired

167
00:09:40,775 --> 00:09:43,474
of staring at medical consoles
all day.

168
00:09:43,514 --> 00:09:46,247
That was very thoughtful
of you, Major.

169
00:09:46,287 --> 00:09:48,416
If there's anything
else you need

170
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:49,858
you let me know.

171
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:51,726
Yeah. I-I'll do that.

172
00:09:57,876 --> 00:09:59,971
What?

173
00:10:03,721 --> 00:10:06,693
Ah...

174
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,559
ah.

175
00:10:08,598 --> 00:10:10,066
Keep moving.

176
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,038
I'll feel a lot better
once we're off this station.

177
00:10:13,073 --> 00:10:14,564
Too bad

178
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,876
because you're not leaving.

179
00:10:16,914 --> 00:10:18,474
Security Chief Odo.

180
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:20,886
I heard you were indisposed.

181
00:10:20,922 --> 00:10:22,721
Well, you heard wrong.

182
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:25,058
Now, you and I need to talk

183
00:10:25,097 --> 00:10:28,399
about those missing
Falangian diamonds.

184
00:10:28,437 --> 00:10:29,837
I told you before

185
00:10:29,873 --> 00:10:32,640
I don't know anything
about them.

186
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:34,410
Well, tell me again.

187
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:37,782
Oh, no, you don't.

188
00:10:46,373 --> 00:10:48,366
Let's go.

189
00:11:02,505 --> 00:11:05,136
How are you feeling?

190
00:11:07,114 --> 00:11:08,879
See for yourself.

191
00:11:10,788 --> 00:11:12,781
It's gotten worse.

192
00:11:14,229 --> 00:11:15,994
Very observant, Doctor.

193
00:11:19,306 --> 00:11:21,971
It's been more
and more difficult

194
00:11:22,011 --> 00:11:24,574
for me to maintain
humanoid form.

195
00:11:24,616 --> 00:11:27,417
The latest test results
aren't encouraging.

196
00:11:27,455 --> 00:11:30,586
The destabilization
of your molecular structure

197
00:11:30,628 --> 00:11:32,791
is increasing
at an alarming rate.

198
00:11:32,832 --> 00:11:40,542
How much longer before I totally
lose my ability to stay solid?

199
00:11:40,581 --> 00:11:44,578
One week, maybe two.

200
00:11:44,623 --> 00:11:47,595
After that, if the
destabilization continues...

201
00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:48,961
Ah.

202
00:11:52,706 --> 00:11:55,872
I sent my findings
to, uh, Dr. Mora.

203
00:11:57,214 --> 00:11:59,411
Frankly,
he was as baffled as I am

204
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:02,425
but he wants you to come
to his laboratory on Bajor

205
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:03,518
for further tests.

206
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:08,793
Seven years of playing lab rat
for him was quite enough.

207
00:12:08,838 --> 00:12:11,503
Besides, you have
complete access to his data.

208
00:12:11,543 --> 00:12:13,809
If the answer was there,
you'd have found it by now.

209
00:12:13,848 --> 00:12:17,618
I don't suppose you'd agree
on a trip to Starfleet Medical.

210
00:12:19,359 --> 00:12:21,922
Doctor...

211
00:12:21,964 --> 00:12:25,300
I think we both know
where I have to go.

212
00:12:27,308 --> 00:12:29,471
I was hoping
it wouldn't come to that.

213
00:12:29,513 --> 00:12:33,613
There doesn't seem to be
much choice.

214
00:12:33,654 --> 00:12:37,856
You have to take me
back to my people.

215
00:12:37,962 --> 00:12:41,766
The only ones
who can help me now

216
00:12:41,804 --> 00:12:44,867
are the Founders.

217
00:12:44,943 --> 00:12:46,810
Once we enter the Gamma Quadrant

218
00:12:46,847 --> 00:12:49,340
we'll begin transmitting
a subspace signal

219
00:12:49,386 --> 00:12:51,618
explaining the purpose
of our mission.

220
00:12:51,657 --> 00:12:53,490
Then we'll enter Dominion space

221
00:12:53,527 --> 00:12:56,192
and try to locate
the Founders' new homeworld.

222
00:12:56,232 --> 00:12:59,432
Odo's only got
a few weeks at best.

223
00:12:59,473 --> 00:13:01,636
You think we can locate
his people in time?

224
00:13:01,677 --> 00:13:03,168
If we go into Dominion air space

225
00:13:03,213 --> 00:13:05,376
without cloaking,
we'll get their attention.

226
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:06,852
You can be sure of that.

227
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:08,514
I'd like to come along.

228
00:13:08,557 --> 00:13:10,254
I don't think so, Major.

229
00:13:10,294 --> 00:13:13,664
I know Odo's your friend,
but I need you here. Besides...

230
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,373
I know, I know.

231
00:13:22,418 --> 00:13:23,716
When will you leave?

232
00:13:23,754 --> 00:13:24,722
Doctor?

233
00:13:24,756 --> 00:13:26,350
As soon as possible.

234
00:13:26,393 --> 00:13:28,056
We'll prepare the <i>Defiant.</i>

235
00:13:28,096 --> 00:13:29,827
You prepare the Constable.

236
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,631
All systems are ready
for departure.

237
00:13:33,674 --> 00:13:36,544
Thank you, Mr. O'Brien.

238
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,741
The Medical Bay's all set

239
00:13:37,782 --> 00:13:40,116
but it'll take a little while
to get Odo on board.

240
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,214
Why not use the transporter?

241
00:13:42,257 --> 00:13:44,727
Well, his molecular structure
is scrambled enough as it is.

242
00:13:44,763 --> 00:13:45,890
The last thing he needs

243
00:13:45,932 --> 00:13:47,868
is a trip
through a transporter buffer.

244
00:13:47,902 --> 00:13:49,769
Benjamin, someone's
requesting permission

245
00:13:49,806 --> 00:13:50,774
to come on board.

246
00:13:50,808 --> 00:13:52,276
Who is it?

247
00:13:52,311 --> 00:13:53,370
Garak.

248
00:13:53,414 --> 00:13:55,942
Tell him the ship is off limits
to Cardassian spies.

249
00:13:55,985 --> 00:13:58,855
Sir, if Garak
is asking to come aboard

250
00:13:58,891 --> 00:14:00,690
I'm sure he has a good reason.

251
00:14:00,728 --> 00:14:03,723
Have Mr. Garak
escorted to the mess hall.

252
00:14:03,767 --> 00:14:04,961
I'll meet him there.

253
00:14:08,468 --> 00:14:10,199
Personally, I think Starfleet

254
00:14:10,238 --> 00:14:12,333
should allow their officers
more latitude

255
00:14:12,376 --> 00:14:15,815
in accessorizing
their uniforms, hmm?

256
00:14:15,849 --> 00:14:18,377
You'd be surprised
what a nice scarf can do.

257
00:14:18,422 --> 00:14:22,522
Ah, Captain,
how good of you to see me.

258
00:14:22,563 --> 00:14:23,724
Make it brief, Garak.

259
00:14:23,765 --> 00:14:26,566
I'd like to accompany you
on your mission.

260
00:14:26,671 --> 00:14:29,302
There are some questions
I'd like to ask the Founders.

261
00:14:29,342 --> 00:14:30,469
Such as?

262
00:14:30,512 --> 00:14:33,040
The Cardassian Empire
lost a number of warships

263
00:14:33,084 --> 00:14:35,384
during their aborted attack
on the Dominion.

264
00:14:35,422 --> 00:14:38,053
I want to know what happened
to the crew members.

265
00:14:38,094 --> 00:14:39,927
I was under the impression
that those ships

266
00:14:39,964 --> 00:14:41,490
were destroyed with all hands.

267
00:14:41,534 --> 00:14:43,436
Oh, we don't know that
for a fact.

268
00:14:43,472 --> 00:14:45,271
As I recall, when the <i>Defiant</i>

269
00:14:45,308 --> 00:14:47,335
left the scene of the battle,
there were a number

270
00:14:47,378 --> 00:14:49,575
of Cardassian warships
still fighting.

271
00:14:49,617 --> 00:14:51,610
Ah, and you think
some of their crew members

272
00:14:51,654 --> 00:14:53,020
might have been taken prisoner.

273
00:14:53,057 --> 00:14:55,357
I live in hope.

274
00:14:57,265 --> 00:14:59,030
Besides, if you do take me along

275
00:14:59,069 --> 00:15:01,130
I think you'll find me
quite useful.

276
00:15:01,173 --> 00:15:03,906
I'm a man of many talents.

277
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:07,476
I have no need for a tailor
on this mission

278
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,046
let alone a spy...

279
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:13,291
but maybe there is something
you can do for me.

280
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,598
This is going to be
a long trip for Odo.

281
00:15:16,638 --> 00:15:19,610
I need someone
to occupy his attention

282
00:15:19,677 --> 00:15:21,544
take his mind off
his condition.

283
00:15:21,581 --> 00:15:24,178
You want me
to keep him company.

284
00:15:24,219 --> 00:15:25,779
No.

285
00:15:25,822 --> 00:15:30,320
Anyone can do that...
Dax, Bashir, myself.

286
00:15:30,364 --> 00:15:33,234
And what would we
have to offer him?

287
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,365
Kindness, sympathy.

288
00:15:35,408 --> 00:15:36,842
That's the last thing he wants.

289
00:15:36,878 --> 00:15:40,373
But where you offer kindness,
I offer mystery.

290
00:15:40,418 --> 00:15:43,356
Where you offer sympathy,
I offer intrigue.

291
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,383
Just give me a seat
next to Odo's bed

292
00:15:45,428 --> 00:15:48,457
and I promise you I'll
conjure up enough innuendoes

293
00:15:48,501 --> 00:15:51,064
half-truths and bald-faced lies

294
00:15:51,106 --> 00:15:54,237
about my so-called career
in the Obsidian Order

295
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:57,217
to keep the Constable
distracted for days.

296
00:15:57,252 --> 00:16:00,281
If there's one thing
Cardassians excel at

297
00:16:00,324 --> 00:16:02,385
it's conversation.

298
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:04,125
You've got yourself a job.

299
00:16:04,165 --> 00:16:06,533
But all questions
for the Founders

300
00:16:06,571 --> 00:16:09,441
will have to wait until after
Odo gets the help he needs.

301
00:16:09,477 --> 00:16:12,472
We share the same priorities,
Captain.

302
00:16:13,952 --> 00:16:15,854
Make sure you remember that.

303
00:16:22,803 --> 00:16:25,331
Odo...

304
00:16:25,374 --> 00:16:27,310
Not now, Quark.

305
00:16:27,345 --> 00:16:28,939
I'm busy.

306
00:16:30,117 --> 00:16:32,349
I hear you're taking
a little trip

307
00:16:32,388 --> 00:16:33,788
to the Gamma Quadrant.

308
00:16:35,796 --> 00:16:37,128
Care to come along?

309
00:16:37,165 --> 00:16:38,497
Are you kidding?

310
00:16:38,535 --> 00:16:41,268
I expect to own this station
by the time you get back.

311
00:16:41,306 --> 00:16:43,105
With you gone

312
00:16:43,143 --> 00:16:46,513
profits from smuggling alone
should go up 60 percent.

313
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,720
Well, don't get used to it.

314
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:53,491
I'll be back before you know it

315
00:16:53,531 --> 00:16:55,831
making your life miserable.

316
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,273
Then you are coming back.

317
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,304
Count on it.

318
00:17:02,348 --> 00:17:04,580
I will.

319
00:17:13,605 --> 00:17:14,903
Take your time.

320
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:18,505
I promise the <i>Defiant</i>
won't leave without you.

321
00:17:27,766 --> 00:17:31,467
Would you like me
to have the Promenade cleared?

322
00:17:31,506 --> 00:17:33,499
That won't be necessary.

323
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,458
We've just cleared
the wormhole.

324
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:17,964
Begin transmitting
a request for assistance.

325
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,970
Then set a course
for the Dominion.

326
00:18:20,004 --> 00:18:21,336
Aye, sir.

327
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,773
It's funny.

328
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:26,908
I've served
on half a dozen ships

329
00:18:26,951 --> 00:18:29,514
and none of them have
had cloaking devices

330
00:18:29,556 --> 00:18:30,751
except the <i>Defiant.</i>

331
00:18:30,792 --> 00:18:33,525
Now that we're not using it,
I feel naked.

332
00:18:33,564 --> 00:18:37,095
It is disconcerting,
to say the least.

333
00:18:37,138 --> 00:18:40,406
Gentlemen, I feel
the same breeze you do.

334
00:18:40,444 --> 00:18:42,573
What are you smiling at?

335
00:18:42,615 --> 00:18:43,810
I don't know.

336
00:18:43,885 --> 00:18:46,550
I guess it's just
being in the same room

337
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,024
with so many naked men.

338
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:53,494
Ah, yes, the assassination
of Proconsul Merrok of Romulus.

339
00:18:53,537 --> 00:18:54,732
Such a tragedy.

340
00:18:54,773 --> 00:18:56,834
I met him once,
a few weeks before he died.

341
00:18:56,911 --> 00:18:58,243
I was working as a gardener

342
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,250
at the Cardassian Embassy
during the...

343
00:19:00,284 --> 00:19:03,415
You were a gardener on Romulus?

344
00:19:03,457 --> 00:19:06,020
My specialty
was Edosian orchids.

345
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,259
Beautiful, but highly toxic.

346
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:13,538
As I recall,
Proconsul Merrok was poisoned.

347
00:19:13,577 --> 00:19:16,242
Funny... I don't remember that

348
00:19:16,282 --> 00:19:20,154
but then again,
so many Romulan dignitaries

349
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,921
died unexpectedly that year.

350
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:24,592
Must be hard
to keep them all straight.

351
00:19:24,632 --> 00:19:25,827
Oh, you can't imagine.

352
00:19:25,935 --> 00:19:30,000
Maybe we should let
the Constable get some rest.

353
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:33,779
I'll let you know
when I need rest, Doctor.

354
00:19:33,818 --> 00:19:38,692
A gardener... at the Cardassian
Embassy on Romulus?

355
00:19:38,728 --> 00:19:39,787
Mm-hmm.

356
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:40,855
Hmm.

357
00:19:40,899 --> 00:19:43,233
Fascinating.

358
00:19:51,352 --> 00:19:53,447
So I get off duty
the other night

359
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,187
and I walk into my quarters

360
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:57,858
and there's Keiko
and Major Kira talking.

361
00:19:57,899 --> 00:19:59,528
Go on.

362
00:19:59,569 --> 00:20:01,698
As soon as I walked
in, they stopped.

363
00:20:01,741 --> 00:20:04,338
It was like turning off
a holosuite program.

364
00:20:04,378 --> 00:20:07,407
They did not want you
to hear what they were saying.

365
00:20:07,451 --> 00:20:10,116
Exactly, but I think
they were talking about me.

366
00:20:10,157 --> 00:20:11,386
Come on, Chief.

367
00:20:11,426 --> 00:20:13,123
You have no way of knowing that.

368
00:20:13,163 --> 00:20:14,928
Oh, I may not have the proof

369
00:20:14,967 --> 00:20:17,028
but I know one thing...
Molly was there

370
00:20:17,071 --> 00:20:19,473
and when she saw me,
she started giggling.

371
00:20:20,745 --> 00:20:22,111
Laugh all you want.

372
00:20:22,148 --> 00:20:25,849
I'm thinking of asking Julian
to come live with us.

373
00:20:25,889 --> 00:20:27,654
Even things up a little.

374
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:31,092
Hold on. I'm reading warp
signatures headed our way.

375
00:20:31,132 --> 00:20:33,261
It looks like our signal's
finally getting

376
00:20:33,303 --> 00:20:34,498
a little attention.

377
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:35,905
Full stop. On screen.

378
00:20:42,021 --> 00:20:44,218
Make that a lot of attention.

379
00:20:57,518 --> 00:20:58,781
We're being hailed.

380
00:20:58,821 --> 00:21:01,418
They want to beam someone aboard
to discuss our request.

381
00:21:01,459 --> 00:21:02,893
I would advise against allowing

382
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,956
Dominion representatives
aboard this ship.

383
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,436
It might be better to negotiate
over the viewscreen.

384
00:21:07,471 --> 00:21:08,939
But I don't want
to give them any reason

385
00:21:08,975 --> 00:21:10,307
to think
that we're hiding something.

386
00:21:10,344 --> 00:21:12,541
Odo needs their help and I'm
going to make sure he gets it.

387
00:21:12,581 --> 00:21:14,210
Commander, tell the Jem'Hadar
that I'll meet

388
00:21:14,252 --> 00:21:15,812
their representative
in the transport bay.

389
00:21:15,855 --> 00:21:16,845
Aye, sir.

390
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,599
That's enough.
Let him go.

391
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,180
Please, everyone.

392
00:21:30,217 --> 00:21:31,708
Lower your weapons.

393
00:21:31,753 --> 00:21:34,121
There's no need for violence.

394
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:39,191
Are you okay?

395
00:21:39,235 --> 00:21:42,139
I've felt better.

396
00:21:44,312 --> 00:21:46,782
I've come for Odo.

397
00:21:46,817 --> 00:21:48,251
Can you help him?

398
00:21:48,286 --> 00:21:51,258
Only the Great Link
can help him.

399
00:21:51,292 --> 00:21:52,955
Leave him with me

400
00:21:52,996 --> 00:21:54,898
and you may return home
unharmed.

401
00:21:54,933 --> 00:21:55,910
I can't do that.

402
00:21:56,043 --> 00:21:59,015
A Founder has given you
an order.

403
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:01,144
You will obey it.

404
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:04,182
I'll let you know
when I need you.

405
00:22:04,226 --> 00:22:07,665
I understand
your concern for Odo.

406
00:22:07,733 --> 00:22:09,099
I feel it, too.

407
00:22:09,136 --> 00:22:11,197
Then let's not stand here
and argue.

408
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,506
Just tell us
where we need to take him.

409
00:22:13,544 --> 00:22:16,175
The faster we get moving,
the better off he'll be.

410
00:22:16,217 --> 00:22:19,678
Your loyalty to Odo
is commendable.

411
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,589
I will not stop you

412
00:22:21,627 --> 00:22:24,895
from accompanying him
on the rest of his journey.

413
00:22:24,934 --> 00:22:28,202
However, I am sure
you understand my reluctance

414
00:22:28,241 --> 00:22:31,008
to reveal the location
of our new home.

415
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:37,357
Commander, I must ask you
to surrender the helm.

416
00:22:37,392 --> 00:22:41,298
Amat'igan will guide your ship
for the remainder of the voyage.

417
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:42,699
Captain?

418
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:46,972
My terms
are not open to negotiation.

419
00:22:47,012 --> 00:22:49,711
Commander, give him your seat.

420
00:22:54,126 --> 00:22:57,189
This will prevent
your navigational computers

421
00:22:57,232 --> 00:22:59,999
from retaining any record
of our journey.

422
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,907
Sir...

423
00:23:02,944 --> 00:23:04,675
Not now, Mr. Worf.

424
00:23:06,383 --> 00:23:08,410
There, that's better.

425
00:23:08,454 --> 00:23:12,895
Now, Captain,
if it's not too much trouble

426
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:16,700
I would like
to pay Odo a visit.

427
00:23:20,011 --> 00:23:21,640
How do I look, Doctor?

428
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,148
Does it matter?

429
00:23:23,184 --> 00:23:24,652
Of course it matters.

430
00:23:24,686 --> 00:23:28,090
I'm here as a representative
of the Cardassian Empire

431
00:23:28,127 --> 00:23:30,655
and I want to make
a good first impression.

432
00:23:30,698 --> 00:23:32,759
Constable, what do you think?

433
00:23:32,836 --> 00:23:36,674
I think the Romulans
poisoned Proconsul Merrok

434
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:40,650
and you were the one responsible
for the transporter accident

435
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:43,121
that killed Subcommander Ustard.

436
00:23:43,157 --> 00:23:46,790
You're getting warmer,
but how do I look?

437
00:23:52,175 --> 00:23:53,804
May I come in?

438
00:23:53,844 --> 00:23:57,180
You'll pardon me
if I don't get up.

439
00:23:57,219 --> 00:24:00,589
Poor Odo...
Look what's become of you.

440
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:03,995
Not a pretty sight, am I?

441
00:24:04,032 --> 00:24:05,763
Pretty?

442
00:24:05,868 --> 00:24:08,168
I wasn't aware
you applied such value

443
00:24:08,207 --> 00:24:09,767
to your outward appearance.

444
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:13,944
Such concerns are
more fitting for solids.

445
00:24:13,986 --> 00:24:15,512
Excuse me, I, um,
don't mean to interrupt

446
00:24:15,555 --> 00:24:17,787
but is there anything
you can do for him?

447
00:24:17,892 --> 00:24:20,523
Odo...

448
00:24:20,565 --> 00:24:22,899
give me your hand.

449
00:24:26,277 --> 00:24:28,874
Don't be afraid.

450
00:25:12,836 --> 00:25:14,533
Amazing.

451
00:25:14,573 --> 00:25:16,941
Feeling better?

452
00:25:16,977 --> 00:25:22,477
Yes, though I still
have to concentrate

453
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:24,583
to hold my form.

454
00:25:24,626 --> 00:25:27,757
Your molecular structure
is still fluctuating

455
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:30,862
but it's nowhere near
as unstable as it was.

456
00:25:30,972 --> 00:25:32,874
Leave now.

457
00:25:32,976 --> 00:25:34,969
I wish to speak
to Odo in private.

458
00:25:35,013 --> 00:25:37,210
Odo is my... patient.

459
00:25:37,252 --> 00:25:39,313
It's all right, Doctor.

460
00:25:39,356 --> 00:25:43,126
Then I'll be right outside.

461
00:25:45,401 --> 00:25:47,462
It can wait, Garak.

462
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:49,407
Of course.

463
00:25:51,447 --> 00:25:54,510
What we have to say
is not for your ears.

464
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:55,953
Wait for me outside.

465
00:26:03,871 --> 00:26:08,073
I wish this meeting were
under better circumstances.

466
00:26:08,113 --> 00:26:13,385
I'm not exactly thrilled
with the circumstances myself.

467
00:26:13,424 --> 00:26:16,555
I had hoped that you'd
return to us on your own.

468
00:26:16,597 --> 00:26:20,036
After all, that Bajoran woman
you were so fond of

469
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:24,238
seems to have taken
an interest in someone else.

470
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:28,686
You know about Major Kira
and First Minister Shakaar.

471
00:26:28,721 --> 00:26:31,454
Despite your rejection of us

472
00:26:31,493 --> 00:26:34,761
we still take an active interest
in your well-being.

473
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:39,240
And just how do you
keep so informed

474
00:26:39,276 --> 00:26:41,839
about my well-being?

475
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,341
There's very little
that escapes our attention.

476
00:26:45,388 --> 00:26:47,585
Are you saying
that you knew I was sick

477
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:49,356
even before we left the station?

478
00:26:49,396 --> 00:26:51,866
What do you think?

479
00:26:57,412 --> 00:26:59,905
I think you did this to me.

480
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,681
You caused my illness

481
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,122
so that I'd be forced
to come home.

482
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,186
As I said

483
00:27:06,229 --> 00:27:09,531
I wish the circumstances
of this meeting were different.

484
00:27:10,972 --> 00:27:14,411
You killed a changeling, Odo.

485
00:27:14,446 --> 00:27:17,179
He was trying
to kill my friends.

486
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,812
I had no choice.

487
00:27:18,854 --> 00:27:21,724
Of course you had a choice

488
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,357
and you chose to side
with the solids.

489
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,098
To protect them,
you were willing to violate

490
00:27:27,137 --> 00:27:29,266
the most sacred law
of our people.

491
00:27:32,382 --> 00:27:36,152
No changeling has ever
harmed another.

492
00:27:36,189 --> 00:27:39,161
Until you.

493
00:27:39,195 --> 00:27:42,634
That's why
we forced you to return home...

494
00:27:42,669 --> 00:27:46,404
to enter the Great Link
and be judged.

495
00:27:54,826 --> 00:27:58,960
What does that mean,
I'm going to be judged?

496
00:27:59,001 --> 00:28:01,403
You will join us
in the Great Link

497
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,742
open your thoughts,
allow us to understand you.

498
00:28:04,779 --> 00:28:07,342
Only then will we
be able to decide

499
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:09,982
whether your actions
were justified.

500
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:12,620
And if you decide
that they weren't?

501
00:28:13,864 --> 00:28:15,332
You will be punished.

502
00:28:15,367 --> 00:28:17,269
Punished how?

503
00:28:17,305 --> 00:28:19,537
You have to understand

504
00:28:19,576 --> 00:28:21,478
that nothing like this
has ever happened

505
00:28:21,513 --> 00:28:24,110
in the entire history
of our people.

506
00:28:24,151 --> 00:28:26,212
We have never had
to sit in judgment

507
00:28:26,256 --> 00:28:28,249
over one of our own.

508
00:28:28,293 --> 00:28:31,663
That's why we took so long
to bring you home.

509
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,697
There was... disagreement
in the Link

510
00:28:35,741 --> 00:28:38,041
over what to do with you.

511
00:28:38,146 --> 00:28:41,607
I'm sorry I've caused you
so much trouble.

512
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:44,420
Perhaps we are to blame.

513
00:28:44,459 --> 00:28:46,452
We sent you away.

514
00:28:46,496 --> 00:28:50,630
But I'm the one
who's going to be punished.

515
00:28:50,671 --> 00:28:54,166
That remains to be seen.

516
00:28:54,211 --> 00:28:58,083
What if I refuse to cooperate?

517
00:28:58,186 --> 00:29:03,094
What if I...
refuse to join the Link?

518
00:29:03,129 --> 00:29:07,331
I stabilized
your condition temporarily.

519
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:10,207
Only the Link can heal you.

520
00:29:10,243 --> 00:29:14,810
If you refuse to join with us,
you will die.

521
00:29:23,202 --> 00:29:25,069
You may go in now, Doctor.

522
00:29:25,106 --> 00:29:26,735
Thank you.

523
00:29:26,776 --> 00:29:28,837
Try not to disturb him.

524
00:29:28,881 --> 00:29:30,544
He needs his rest.

525
00:29:30,584 --> 00:29:32,713
I'll bear that in mind.

526
00:29:37,865 --> 00:29:39,094
Excuse me, madam.

527
00:29:39,201 --> 00:29:41,103
May I have
a moment of your time?

528
00:29:41,205 --> 00:29:42,765
You are Cardassian.

529
00:29:42,808 --> 00:29:45,244
That's right,
and on behalf of my people

530
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,081
I'd like to learn
if there were any survivors

531
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,248
after our attack
on your homeland.

532
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:51,782
Cardassian survivors?

533
00:29:51,826 --> 00:29:53,955
Yes.

534
00:29:53,997 --> 00:29:56,525
There were
no Cardassian survivors.

535
00:29:56,569 --> 00:30:00,236
You mean... they're all dead?

536
00:30:00,276 --> 00:30:01,802
They're dead.

537
00:30:01,846 --> 00:30:03,314
You're dead.

538
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,947
Cardassia is dead.

539
00:30:05,988 --> 00:30:10,292
Your people were doomed
the moment they attacked us.

540
00:30:10,331 --> 00:30:13,428
I believe
that answers your question.

541
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:19,073
It was a pleasure meeting you.

542
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:36,919
I don't suppose there's any way

543
00:30:36,962 --> 00:30:38,362
Odo could hide
a communicator on him

544
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:39,958
when he's in the Link
with the Founders.

545
00:30:40,001 --> 00:30:41,971
I do not think
he'll be able to hide anything

546
00:30:42,005 --> 00:30:42,973
from the Founders.

547
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,339
There must be
some way we can keep

548
00:30:44,377 --> 00:30:46,370
a transporter lock on him
while he's in the Link.

549
00:30:46,414 --> 00:30:48,782
What about injecting him
with radio-nuclides?

550
00:30:48,852 --> 00:30:50,515
Well, that would give
the transporter

551
00:30:50,556 --> 00:30:51,546
something to lock onto

552
00:30:51,591 --> 00:30:53,493
but there's no way
to be sure the nuclides

553
00:30:53,528 --> 00:30:55,122
won't disperse
throughout the Link.

554
00:30:55,164 --> 00:30:57,566
If he's in there for more than
a few hours, we could end up

555
00:30:57,603 --> 00:30:59,505
with a transporter pad
full of shape-shifters.

556
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,008
I wouldn't worry
about that, Chief.

557
00:31:04,349 --> 00:31:06,251
Constable, shouldn't you
be in bed?

558
00:31:06,287 --> 00:31:08,314
He insisted on coming
to see you himself.

559
00:31:08,357 --> 00:31:10,988
I thought you might
be trying to help me

560
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:13,968
and I wanted to say
don't bother.

561
00:31:14,002 --> 00:31:16,599
Odo, surely you don't expect us
to just stand by

562
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,634
while they do
God knows what to you.

563
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:21,776
That is exactly what I expect.

564
00:31:21,851 --> 00:31:26,725
Captain, I want to be judged.

565
00:31:26,761 --> 00:31:30,029
I'm the only changeling
who's ever harmed another.

566
00:31:30,068 --> 00:31:34,406
I've spent most of my life
bringing people to justice.

567
00:31:34,444 --> 00:31:37,939
Now that it's my turn,
how can I run away?

568
00:31:39,186 --> 00:31:41,520
Are you sure
that's what you'll find

569
00:31:41,558 --> 00:31:43,460
in the Great Link... justice?

570
00:31:43,495 --> 00:31:44,724
I've heard lots of stories

571
00:31:44,764 --> 00:31:46,461
about the Dominion
and the Founders

572
00:31:46,501 --> 00:31:49,234
and justice seems to be
the last thing on their minds.

573
00:31:49,272 --> 00:31:52,767
Nevertheless, they're my people

574
00:31:52,813 --> 00:31:55,842
and I intend
to accept their judgment.

575
00:31:58,892 --> 00:32:00,190
Report.

576
00:32:00,228 --> 00:32:01,822
Everything's status quo.

577
00:32:01,865 --> 00:32:03,026
If you want
more details than that

578
00:32:03,067 --> 00:32:05,003
you'll have to ask
our navigator.

579
00:32:06,908 --> 00:32:08,399
How much longer?

580
00:32:08,445 --> 00:32:11,144
You'll be informed
when we reach our destination.

581
00:32:11,183 --> 00:32:14,019
We will be within
transporter range

582
00:32:14,055 --> 00:32:16,686
of my world
in less than an hour.

583
00:32:16,728 --> 00:32:18,254
After we have achieved orbit

584
00:32:18,297 --> 00:32:21,998
Odo and I
will transport to the surface.

585
00:32:22,038 --> 00:32:24,531
Dr. Bashir and I
will be joining you.

586
00:32:25,846 --> 00:32:27,782
If you wish

587
00:32:27,817 --> 00:32:31,416
but Odo may be
in the Link for days.

588
00:32:31,458 --> 00:32:33,291
We'll wait.

589
00:32:50,996 --> 00:32:52,761
Come, Odo.

590
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,326
It's time.

591
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,490
How long has it been?

592
00:33:55,524 --> 00:33:57,391
I've lost track.

593
00:33:57,428 --> 00:33:59,125
So have I.

594
00:34:00,501 --> 00:34:02,494
Doctor...

595
00:34:02,538 --> 00:34:04,371
Oh...

596
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:06,379
oh...

597
00:34:06,413 --> 00:34:08,178
right.

598
00:34:23,815 --> 00:34:25,341
Wait here.

599
00:34:35,104 --> 00:34:36,333
Garak.

600
00:34:36,373 --> 00:34:37,899
Just as I thought.

601
00:34:37,943 --> 00:34:39,104
Don't tell me.

602
00:34:39,145 --> 00:34:41,513
I overlooked one
of the security monitors.

603
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,918
You were trying to override
the launch controls

604
00:34:43,955 --> 00:34:45,218
for the quantum torpedoes.

605
00:34:45,257 --> 00:34:47,990
I was hoping to gain control
of the phasers as well.

606
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:50,091
I just hadn't got
around to it yet.

607
00:34:50,134 --> 00:34:51,363
Don't you see?

608
00:34:51,403 --> 00:34:52,871
We have an opportunity here...

609
00:34:52,906 --> 00:34:55,469
a chance to end
the Dominion threat

610
00:34:55,511 --> 00:34:56,638
once and for all.

611
00:34:56,681 --> 00:34:59,015
We have enough firepower
on this ship

612
00:34:59,052 --> 00:35:01,751
to turn that planet
into a smoking cinder.

613
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:05,492
Personally, I think that
would be a very good thing.

614
00:35:05,531 --> 00:35:06,692
And what about Odo

615
00:35:06,734 --> 00:35:08,499
and Captain Sisko
and Dr. Bashir?

616
00:35:08,537 --> 00:35:09,698
They'll die.

617
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,337
And once the Jem'Hadar ships
realize what we're doing

618
00:35:12,378 --> 00:35:13,641
so will we.

619
00:35:13,681 --> 00:35:15,275
But what are our lives

620
00:35:15,317 --> 00:35:19,451
compared to saving
the entire Alpha Quadrant?

621
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,223
We are not here to wage war.

622
00:35:21,263 --> 00:35:24,201
I'm not talking about war.

623
00:35:24,235 --> 00:35:29,109
What I'm proposing is wiping out
every Founder on that planet...

624
00:35:29,145 --> 00:35:32,015
obliterating the Great Link.

625
00:35:32,118 --> 00:35:35,284
Come now, Mr. Worf,
you're a Klingon.

626
00:35:35,324 --> 00:35:38,421
Don't tell me you'd object
to a little genocide

627
00:35:38,463 --> 00:35:40,399
in the name of self-defense.

628
00:35:41,771 --> 00:35:44,766
I am a warrior, not a murderer.

629
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:50,345
What you are
is a great disappointment.

630
00:36:10,127 --> 00:36:12,222
You fight well...

631
00:36:12,265 --> 00:36:13,825
for a tailor.

632
00:36:19,646 --> 00:36:20,875
Doctor.

633
00:36:43,527 --> 00:36:45,554
Odo, are you all right?

634
00:36:45,597 --> 00:36:49,594
Captain, I'm getting
some strange readings.

635
00:37:02,198 --> 00:37:03,310
What have you done to him?

636
00:37:03,443 --> 00:37:05,174
He has been judged.

637
00:37:05,214 --> 00:37:07,081
Captain...

638
00:37:07,118 --> 00:37:08,678
I'm reading a heart...

639
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,188
lungs...

640
00:37:10,224 --> 00:37:12,126
and a digestive system.

641
00:37:12,161 --> 00:37:14,427
It's as if he were... human.

642
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:16,435
We gave him what he wanted.

643
00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:18,098
We made him a solid.

644
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:21,135
He's one of you now.

645
00:37:23,316 --> 00:37:25,616
Oh, poor Odo.

646
00:37:25,654 --> 00:37:28,626
Perhaps we should
have killed you.

647
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:31,791
It would have been
far less cruel.

648
00:37:36,609 --> 00:37:38,135
He's yours.

649
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,616
Take him and go.

650
00:37:42,956 --> 00:37:44,585
Sisko to <i>Defiant.</i>

651
00:37:44,625 --> 00:37:46,059
Go ahead, Captain.

652
00:37:46,095 --> 00:37:47,655
Three to beam up.

653
00:38:09,642 --> 00:38:12,409
Staring at it isn't going
to make it change shape.

654
00:38:12,448 --> 00:38:14,247
It's blood all right.

655
00:38:14,318 --> 00:38:16,686
Not a trace
of changeling protoplasm

656
00:38:16,723 --> 00:38:18,283
in your entire system.

657
00:38:22,301 --> 00:38:25,364
Type "O" negative,
if you're wondering.

658
00:38:25,407 --> 00:38:28,436
I'll be sure to remember that.

659
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,318
Well, physiologically,
you're completely human.

660
00:38:33,824 --> 00:38:35,521
Except for my face.

661
00:38:35,561 --> 00:38:38,192
Yes, I was wondering
about that...

662
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:40,226
why they left it unchanged.

663
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,208
They left it this way
on purpose...

664
00:38:44,245 --> 00:38:47,115
to make sure
I'd never forget what I was...

665
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:50,750
and...

666
00:38:50,791 --> 00:38:52,624
what I've lost.

667
00:39:02,983 --> 00:39:07,253
Captain's Log, Stardate 49962.4.

668
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:09,124
After leaving
our Jem'Hadar escorts

669
00:39:09,161 --> 00:39:10,892
at the edge of Dominion space

670
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:13,402
the <i>Defiant</i> has returned home

671
00:39:13,436 --> 00:39:14,870
but for Constable Odo

672
00:39:14,906 --> 00:39:17,639
I'm afraid
the journey has just begun.

673
00:39:17,678 --> 00:39:18,668
How does it feel?

674
00:39:20,317 --> 00:39:22,446
You comfortable?

675
00:39:22,488 --> 00:39:24,822
Not too tight?

676
00:39:24,859 --> 00:39:26,886
It's fine.

677
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:30,700
Though it does
make me feel a bit...

678
00:39:30,737 --> 00:39:32,171
Itchy?

679
00:39:32,207 --> 00:39:33,767
It's the Inkarian wool.

680
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:35,301
You'll get used to it.

681
00:39:35,347 --> 00:39:38,842
Unless, of course, you're
allergic to Inkarian wool.

682
00:39:38,888 --> 00:39:40,721
No, it's not the uniform.

683
00:39:40,757 --> 00:39:42,283
I...

684
00:39:42,327 --> 00:39:43,956
I think I'm...

685
00:39:43,998 --> 00:39:46,298
hungry?

686
00:39:46,335 --> 00:39:48,805
You know, I envy you.

687
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:52,643
Well, think of all
the wonderful foods

688
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:55,244
you'll get to enjoy
for the first time.

689
00:39:55,287 --> 00:39:58,054
Hmph! I can hardly wait.

690
00:39:58,093 --> 00:40:02,227
Well, you've done your job.

691
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:06,071
Now I have to do mine.

692
00:40:06,109 --> 00:40:07,669
Yes, I suppose you do.

693
00:40:07,711 --> 00:40:10,945
Six months
in a holding cell, hmm?

694
00:40:10,985 --> 00:40:15,654
The thought is unattractive,
to say the least.

695
00:40:15,694 --> 00:40:18,723
Well, if you ask me, Captain
Sisko let you off lightly.

696
00:40:18,767 --> 00:40:21,671
Sabotage, assaulting
a Federation officer

697
00:40:21,706 --> 00:40:22,969
attempting to incite war

698
00:40:23,009 --> 00:40:25,343
between the Federation
and the Dominion.

699
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:29,844
Yes, but my heart
was in the right place.

700
00:40:29,889 --> 00:40:30,652
Hmph.

701
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:33,092
There you are, Odo.

702
00:40:33,129 --> 00:40:34,689
I've been looking
all over for you.

703
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:36,998
I heard about what happened.

704
00:40:37,037 --> 00:40:38,096
I'm so sorry.

705
00:40:38,139 --> 00:40:40,109
Oh...

706
00:40:40,143 --> 00:40:41,577
thank you.

707
00:40:41,612 --> 00:40:44,584
I know it won't be easy,
but, eventually

708
00:40:44,618 --> 00:40:47,954
you'll see how being a humanoid
has its advantages.

709
00:40:47,992 --> 00:40:54,700
If there's anything at all
I can do, just let me know.

710
00:41:03,489 --> 00:41:06,256
What a generous offer.

711
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,359
Let's go, Garak.

712
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,585
Constable?

713
00:41:21,626 --> 00:41:23,186
You all right?

714
00:41:23,229 --> 00:41:24,322
It's nothing.

715
00:41:24,365 --> 00:41:26,164
It's just a headache.

716
00:41:26,202 --> 00:41:30,040
Every once in a while,
I still get flashes of memory

717
00:41:30,076 --> 00:41:34,916
from the Great Link...
a jumble of images, or a word

718
00:41:34,952 --> 00:41:36,819
but I can't quite
make sense of it.

719
00:41:36,856 --> 00:41:38,985
You know, there's
no reason to rush things.

720
00:41:39,028 --> 00:41:41,328
You don't have to go back
to work right away.

721
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:43,267
Yes, I do!

722
00:41:48,713 --> 00:41:51,047
When I joined
with the other changelings

723
00:41:51,085 --> 00:41:52,451
in the Great Link, I...

724
00:41:52,487 --> 00:41:55,254
felt something
I've never felt before.

725
00:41:56,262 --> 00:41:58,825
In that moment...

726
00:41:58,866 --> 00:42:01,565
I knew I was home.

727
00:42:01,672 --> 00:42:03,106
For the first time

728
00:42:03,142 --> 00:42:05,978
I felt that I
understood my people...

729
00:42:06,014 --> 00:42:08,450
their distrust of the solids...

730
00:42:08,486 --> 00:42:12,790
their willingness to do anything
to protect themselves.

731
00:42:12,828 --> 00:42:15,766
And then...

732
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,535
in an instant,
it was all snatched away.

733
00:42:21,479 --> 00:42:25,044
I'm trapped inside this body.

734
00:42:25,086 --> 00:42:28,924
I can never rejoin
the Great Link.

735
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,126
My job is the only thing
I have left.

736
00:42:37,944 --> 00:42:39,811
Besides, I'm still the best

737
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:42,581
law enforcement officer
on this station.

738
00:42:42,621 --> 00:42:43,748
You're the best

739
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:46,489
law enforcement officer
in this sector...

740
00:42:46,529 --> 00:42:48,465
maybe the whole damn Quadrant.

741
00:42:50,503 --> 00:42:51,869
Maybe.

742
00:42:56,182 --> 00:42:58,345
What's that all about?

743
00:42:58,386 --> 00:42:59,581
I have no idea.

744
00:42:59,621 --> 00:43:02,616
The Klingon Empire
is tired of words

745
00:43:02,661 --> 00:43:05,131
of negotiation

746
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:07,729
of the endless delaying tactics
of the Federation.

747
00:43:07,771 --> 00:43:10,675
Therefore, as of today,
a Klingon task force

748
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:13,546
has been dispatched
to the Archanis sector.

749
00:43:13,583 --> 00:43:16,316
Starfleet has ten days
to abandon their bases

750
00:43:16,355 --> 00:43:18,918
and withdraw their forces
from the sector.

751
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,583
It's coming in
on all frequencies.

752
00:43:20,716 --> 00:43:23,050
...after that time
will be considered the enemy

753
00:43:23,087 --> 00:43:24,055
and fired upon.

754
00:43:24,157 --> 00:43:27,892
Major, put the station
on combat alert.

755
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:29,923
Notify the Bajoran militia.

756
00:43:31,938 --> 00:43:32,997
Captain...

757
00:43:33,041 --> 00:43:35,409
Those in the Klingon Empire...

758
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,573
It's him.

759
00:43:36,615 --> 00:43:38,881
Gowron?
What about him?

760
00:43:38,919 --> 00:43:42,552
During the Link, I sensed
that the other changelings

761
00:43:42,593 --> 00:43:48,469
were trying to hide things
from me... faces, names...

762
00:43:48,505 --> 00:43:51,375
one of them was him.

763
00:43:51,411 --> 00:43:52,879
What are you saying?

764
00:43:52,914 --> 00:43:57,116
I'm saying
that he's one of them.

765
00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:01,494
Gowron, the head
of the Klingon Empire

766
00:44:01,531 --> 00:44:04,298
is a changeling.

767
00:44:04,337 --> 00:44:06,068
Let there be no mistake

768
00:44:06,107 --> 00:44:07,974
no misinterpretation
of my words.

769
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:11,882
Archanis is ours
and we will take it back.

770
00:44:11,918 --> 00:44:14,754
Resist us in any way
and there will be war.
