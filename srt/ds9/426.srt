1
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:05,464
You wanted to
see me, Garak?

2
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:08,717
Ah! Constable.
How good of you
to stop by.

3
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:12,554
A shoplifter?

4
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,473
Excuse me?

5
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:16,684
Is something wrong?

6
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:19,060
WOMAN:
Here I come.

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,270
What do you think?

8
00:00:22,982 --> 00:00:26,944
"A thing of beauty
is a joy forever."

9
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:29,321
Oh, well, then
put it on my account.

10
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:30,698
I'll wear it to work.

11
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:32,491
A splendid idea.

12
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:36,954
Ah. Security Chief Odo

13
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:39,581
I'd like to introduce you
to Chalan Aroya--

14
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,166
one of my best customers.

15
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,295
I own the Celestial Cafe--

16
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:48,674
the new Bajoran restaurant
overlooking the Promenade?

17
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:50,885
I-I'm familiar with it.

18
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,891
I watch you walk by
every morning

19
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:59,184
when you're on patrol.

20
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,186
0937.

21
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,480
You're very precise.

22
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:09,277
How... nice of
you to notice.

23
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:10,946
I was hoping

24
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:12,531
one day
you might stop in

25
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:14,115
when you're not working.

26
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:18,119
Uh... I don't eat.

27
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,538
I do

28
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:21,832
and I hate to eat alone.

29
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,210
Think about it.

30
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:32,509
Oh, and next time you're
on the Second Level

31
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,012
don't forget to say hello.

32
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,268
The next time you call me

33
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:44,145
it had better be
to report a crime.

34
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:47,691
Now that you mention it,
I've just witnessed a crime:

35
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:50,569
Letting Aroya
walk out of here

36
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,153
without arranging a date.

37
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,197
You should be locked away
for that.

38
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,742
You humanoids--
you're all obsessed

39
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:59,078
with these convoluted
mating rituals.

40
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:01,246
True, but do you think
we'd waste

41
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:04,458
so much time on something
that wasn't worthwhile?

42
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,043
I'll never understand you.

43
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:08,169
You're such a sensitive man

44
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,589
yet there are so many aspects
of humanoid life

45
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:12,132
that you simply refuse

46
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,717
to explore.

47
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,469
I have no desire

48
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:18,555
to become a slave
to humanoid obsessions.

49
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,599
But you have
to admit

50
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,601
she is quite lovely.

51
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,482
Well... she is, isn't she?

52
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,691
Mm-hmm.

53
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:30,859
Oh!

54
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,360
(<i> groaning</i> )

55
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,988
Odo!

56
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:35,990
What's wrong?

57
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,408
I... I don't know.

58
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,869
(<i> yelling in pain</i> )

59
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,587
Garak to Dr. Bashir.

60
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,673
I need a medical
emergency team

61
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,134
sent to my shop
immediately.

62
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:56,379
Doctor, this is a waste of time.

63
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,465
You don't know enough
about changeling physiology

64
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,009
to diagnose what's wrong
with me, no one does.

65
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,303
Actually, I do have
some idea what's going on.

66
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,388
I've compared
your current medical scans

67
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,057
with ones I made
over the last four years

68
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,017
and there are
some noticeable differences.

69
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,435
Normally, when you're
in humanoid form

70
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,604
you have a specific
density of 1.4

71
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:14,522
which is constant
throughout your body.

72
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:17,525
Your mass and density only vary
when you change shape.

73
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:20,403
Right now, your mass and density
are in a state of fluctuation.

74
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,530
Do you know what's causing it?
No.

75
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,824
Well, do you know
how to prevent it

76
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,201
from happening again?
Not yet.

77
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,203
Well, then let me know
when you do.

78
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:30,289
I'm afraid I can't
let you leave just yet.

79
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:31,999
Moving seems to increase
the fluctuations

80
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,042
and may bring on
another attack.

81
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,836
Are you saying
I have to stay here

82
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,378
until you discover a cure?

83
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,422
Or until the fluctuations
stop on their own.

84
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,467
For all I know
this could be a normal
biological process--

85
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,678
the changeling
equivalent of puberty...

86
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,596
or menopause.

87
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,141
That's an interesting
theory, Doctor--

88
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:52,019
one I suggest
that you keep to yourself.

89
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,812
Don't worry.

90
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,981
This could just as easily
turn out to be a virus

91
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,774
or a bacterial infection.

92
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,443
Now, lie back, and I promise
I'll do everything I can

93
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:03,697
to get you out of here
as soon as possible.

94
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,573
(<i> sigh of disgust</i> )

95
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:08,618
(<i> sighing</i> )

96
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,294
We find the Federation's demands

97
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:20,172
that we return
the captured Cardassian colonies

98
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:22,216
insulting and provocative.

99
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:25,426
Klingon blood was spilled
to conquer those worlds.

100
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:28,013
They are now part
of the Klingon Empire

101
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:30,349
and we will never give them up.

102
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,433
Furthermore, if the Federation

103
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:35,478
still harbors any hope
of peaceful coexistence

104
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,522
with the Klingon Empire

105
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,901
it must abandon all starbases
and military installations

106
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,485
in the Archanis sector.

107
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:46,156
Our claim to Archanis IV
and the surrounding territory

108
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:49,868
is ancient and indisputable.

109
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:53,038
We advise the Federation
to leave Archanis

110
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,083
or prepare to face
the consequences.

111
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,876
Long live the Empire.

112
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:06,176
This recording was sent
to the Federation Council
three days ago.

113
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:09,512
If Gowron is willing to go to
war over the Archanis sector

114
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,473
then he has become even more
dangerous than I thought.

115
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,017
I don't get it.

116
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,353
The Klingons relinquished
their claim to Archanis IV

117
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:17,729
a hundred years ago.

118
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,564
I guess
they changed their mind.

119
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:20,982
I don't think Gowron

120
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,859
gives a damn about Archanis.

121
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,404
He's just looking for an excuse
to rattle his saber.

122
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:27,030
The question is why.

123
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,616
Yesterday, I talked to
an old friend of Curzon's

124
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,618
from the diplomatic corps.

125
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,494
She says
that representatives

126
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,580
from Federation worlds
near the Klingon border

127
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,625
are already urging
a preemptive strike.

128
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,002
Sounds like war
may be inevitable.

129
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,213
I hope you're wrong, Major,

130
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:47,259
but right now, there's not much
we can do about it either way.

131
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:51,221
Archanis IV
is a long way from here.

132
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,307
(<i> sneezing</i> )

133
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:55,600
Two, three...

134
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,727
I say she stops
at seven.

135
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,354
I say eight.
Mr. Worf?

136
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,856
Ten.

137
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,820
Oh, I hate being pregnant!

138
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,156
I win.
My nose hasn't

139
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:12,700
stopped itching for weeks.
DAX:
We've noticed.

140
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,412
Is there anything
Dr. Bashir can do about it?

141
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:18,665
I'm Bajoran. Human women
get nauseous-- we sneeze.

142
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,376
Besides, I think Dr. Bashir's
hands are full right now.

143
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:24,296
How<i> is</i> 
the Constable?
No news yet.

144
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:26,589
I was thinking
about going to visit him.

145
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,091
I doubt that he
would wish to be seen

146
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,592
in such a weakened state.

147
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,969
What if he wants
some company--

148
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,429
someone to take his
mind off his problems?

149
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:35,140
That is doubtful.
Odo values his privacy.

150
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,684
He does not like
to... socialize.

151
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,269
I think it's
all an act.

152
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,855
It is not an act.
He told me so himself.

153
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,024
But you were
socializing with him

154
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,066
when he said it.

155
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,319
Captain,
was Dax's last host

156
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:48,695
as argumentative
as this one?

157
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:49,821
Worse.

158
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,240
Thank you, Benjamin...
I think.

159
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,784
Hopefully, Odo will get
back on his feet soon.

160
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,578
In the meantime, I want him
left alone to rest. Agreed?

161
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:58,621
(<i> Kira sneezing</i> )

162
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,664
Agreed.

163
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,263
May I come in?

164
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,640
If you're looking
for Dr. Bashir

165
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,851
he's not in right now.

166
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:21,978
Actually,
I came to see you.

167
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,813
To be honest, Major

168
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,649
I really don't feel like
company at the moment.

169
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,568
I didn't plan on staying.

170
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,028
I just came
to bring you this.

171
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,784
Today's criminal
activities report.

172
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:39,204
I figured you might
be getting tired

173
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,873
of staring at
medical consoles all day.

174
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:44,792
That was very thoughtful
of you, Major.

175
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,836
If there's anything
else you need

176
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,296
you let me know.

177
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,964
Yeah. I-I'll do that.

178
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,473
What?

179
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,141
(<i> grunting</i> )

180
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:05,146
Ah...

181
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,940
ah.

182
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,608
Keep moving.

183
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,445
I'll feel a lot better
once we're off this station.

184
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:12,904
ODO:
Too bad

185
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:15,365
because you're not leaving.

186
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:16,824
Security Chief Odo.

187
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:19,327
I heard
you were indisposed.

188
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,079
Well, you heard wrong.

189
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,457
Now, you and I
need to talk

190
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:26,751
about those missing
Falangian diamonds.

191
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,211
I told you before

192
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:31,047
I don't know anything
about them.

193
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,757
Well, tell me again.

194
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:36,177
Oh, no, you don't.

195
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,305
(<i> yelling in pain</i> )

196
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,687
Let's go.

197
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:02,203
How are you feeling?

198
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,124
See for yourself.

199
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,003
It's gotten worse.

200
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:13,006
Very observant, Doctor.

201
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:19,095
It's been more
and more difficult

202
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,848
for me to maintain
humanoid form.

203
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,643
The latest test results
aren't encouraging.

204
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:27,854
The destabilization
of your molecular structure

205
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:31,107
is increasing
at an alarming rate.

206
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:37,531
How much longer before I totally
lose my ability to stay solid?

207
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:41,201
One week, maybe two.

208
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:44,663
After that, if
the destabilization continues...

209
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:46,164
Ah.

210
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:53,046
I sent my findings
to, uh, Dr. Mora.

211
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,633
Frankly,
he was as baffled as I am,

212
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:59,135
but he wants you to come
to his laboratory on Bajor

213
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,637
for further tests.

214
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,347
(<i> snorts</i> )

215
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:06,142
Seven years of playing lab rat
for him was quite enough.

216
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,769
Besides, you have
complete access to his data.

217
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,938
If the answer was there,
you'd have found it by now.

218
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:12,731
I don't suppose
you'd agree

219
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,775
on a trip to Starfleet Medical.

220
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,613
Doctor...

221
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:22,367
I think we both know
where I have to go.

222
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,705
I was hoping
it wouldn't come to that.

223
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:30,875
There doesn't seem to be
much choice.

224
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:35,255
You have to take me
back to my people.

225
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:38,883
The only ones
who can help me now

226
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,844
are the Founders.

227
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,431
Once we enter the Gamma Quadrant

228
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,558
we'll begin transmitting
a subspace signal

229
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:48,643
explaining the purpose
of our mission.

230
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,478
Then we'll enter
Dominion space

231
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,064
and try to locate
the Founders' new homeworld.

232
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:56,401
Odo's only got
a few weeks at best.

233
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,612
You think we can locate
his people in time?

234
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:00,238
If we go into
Dominion air space

235
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,490
without cloaking, we'll
get their attention.

236
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,824
You can be sure of that.

237
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,577
I'd like
to come along.

238
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:07,454
I don't think
so, Major.

239
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:10,582
I know Odo's your friend,
but I need you here. Besides...

240
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,875
(<i> sneezes</i> )

241
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:19,466
I know, I know.

242
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:20,634
When will you leave?

243
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:21,635
Doctor?

244
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,344
As soon as possible.

245
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,012
We'll prepare the<i> Defiant.</i>

246
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,765
You prepare the Constable.

247
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,727
All systems are ready
for departure.

248
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:33,605
Thank you, Mr. O'Brien.

249
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,315
The Medical Bay's all set

250
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,066
but it'll take a little while
to get Odo on board.

251
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,360
Why not use
the transporter?

252
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,571
Well, his molecular structure
is scrambled enough as it is.

253
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:42,947
The last thing he needs

254
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,865
is a trip through a
transporter buffer.

255
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,618
Benjamin, someone's
requesting permission

256
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:47,619
to come on board.

257
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:49,245
Who is it?

258
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,330
Garak.

259
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,790
Tell him the ship
is off limits

260
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,040
to Cardassian spies.

261
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,918
Sir, if Garak
is asking to come aboard

262
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,671
I'm sure he has
a good reason.

263
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:00,757
Have Mr. Garak
escorted to the mess hall.

264
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,133
I'll meet him there.

265
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:07,597
Personally,
I think Starfleet

266
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,766
should allow their officers
more latitude

267
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:13,060
in accessorizing
their uniforms, hmm?

268
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,814
You'd be surprised
what a nice scarf can do.

269
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:19,734
Ah, Captain,
how good of you to see me.

270
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,152
Make it brief, Garak.

271
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:24,071
I'd like to accompany you
on your mission.

272
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,491
There are some questions
I'd like to ask the Founders.

273
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,908
Such as?

274
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:30,370
The Cardassian Empire
lost a number of warships

275
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,789
during their aborted attack
on the Dominion.

276
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,291
I want to know what happened
to the crew members.

277
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,126
I was under the impression
that those ships

278
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,878
were destroyed
with all hands.

279
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,839
Oh, we don't know that
for a fact.

280
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:42,632
As I recall,
when the<i> Defiant</i>

281
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,718
left the scene of the battle,
there were a number

282
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:46,927
of Cardassian warships
still fighting.

283
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,971
Ah, and you think some
of their crew members

284
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,348
might have been
taken prisoner.

285
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,517
I live in hope.

286
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,270
Besides, if you do
take me along,

287
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,439
I think you'll find me
quite useful.

288
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,150
I'm a man
of many talents.

289
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,696
I have no need for a
tailor on this mission

290
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,322
let alone a spy...

291
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,825
but maybe there
is something

292
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,702
you can do for me.

293
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:13,996
This is going to be
a long trip for Odo.

294
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:17,041
I need someone to
occupy his attention,

295
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,752
take his mind off
his condition.

296
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:21,295
You want me
to keep him company.

297
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,214
No.

298
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:27,635
Anyone can do that--
Dax, Bashir, myself.

299
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,597
And what would we
have to offer him?

300
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,473
Kindness, sympathy.

301
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,100
That's the last
thing he wants.

302
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,771
But where you offer kindness,
I offer mystery.

303
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:40,732
Where you offer sympathy,
I offer intrigue.

304
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,734
Just give me a seat
next to Odo's bed

305
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:45,862
and I promise you I'll
conjure up enough innuendoes,

306
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:48,364
half-truths
and bald-faced lies

307
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,576
about my so-called career
in the Obsidian Order

308
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:54,495
to keep the Constable
distracted for days.

309
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:57,624
If there's one thing
Cardassians excel at

310
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,709
it's conversation.

311
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,419
You've got yourself a job.

312
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,922
But all questions
for the Founders

313
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:06,883
will have to wait until after
Odo gets the help he needs.

314
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:09,719
We share the same priorities,
Captain.

315
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,180
Make sure you remember that.

316
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,853
(<i> groaning</i> )

317
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,523
QUARK:
Odo...

318
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,400
Not now, Quark.

319
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,026
I'm busy.

320
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,739
I hear you're taking
a little trip

321
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:31,073
to the Gamma Quadrant.

322
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,243
Care to come along?

323
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,829
Are you kidding?

324
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:38,414
I expect to own this station
by the time you get back.

325
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,374
With you gone

326
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,711
profits from smuggling alone
should go up 60 percent.

327
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,966
Well, don't get used to it.

328
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:50,885
I'll be back before you know it

329
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:53,095
making your life miserable.

330
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:57,308
Then you are coming back.

331
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:59,393
Count on it.

332
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,855
I will.

333
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:12,406
Take your time.

334
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:15,743
I promise the<i> Defiant</i>
won't leave without you.

335
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,462
Would you
like me

336
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,882
to have the
Promenade cleared?

337
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,717
That won't be necessary.

338
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,425
We've just cleared
the wormhole.

339
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,802
Begin transmitting
a request for assistance.

340
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,846
Then set a course
for the Dominion.

341
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,056
Aye, sir.

342
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,684
It's funny.

343
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,895
I've served on
half a dozen ships

344
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:26,230
and none of them have
had cloaking devices

345
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,690
except the<i> Defiant.</i>

346
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,484
Now that we're not
using it, I feel naked.

347
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:33,863
It is disconcerting,
to say the least.

348
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:37,366
Gentlemen, I feel the
same breeze you do.

349
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,452
What are you smiling at?

350
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:40,954
I don't know.

351
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:42,872
I guess it's just
being in the same room

352
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,707
with so many naked men.

353
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:50,212
Ah, yes, the assassination
of Proconsul Merrok of Romulus.

354
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,714
Such a tragedy.

355
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,674
I met him once,
a few weeks before he died.

356
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,093
I was working as a gardener

357
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:57,011
at the Cardassian Embassy
during the...

358
00:18:57,011 --> 00:19:00,306
You were a gardener
on Romulus?

359
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,892
My specialty
was Edosian orchids.

360
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,185
Beautiful,
but highly toxic.

361
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,353
As I recall

362
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:10,524
Proconsul Merrok was poisoned.

363
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:13,152
Funny... I don't remember that,

364
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:17,031
but then again,
so many Romulan dignitaries

365
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:18,825
died unexpectedly
that year.

366
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:21,494
Must be hard
to keep them
all straight.

367
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:22,703
Oh, you can't imagine.

368
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,455
Maybe

369
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:26,958
we should let the
Constable get some rest.

370
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:30,753
I'll let you know
when I need rest, Doctor.

371
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:35,466
A gardener... at the Cardassian
Embassy on Romulus?

372
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:36,550
Mm-hmm.

373
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,635
Hmm.

374
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:39,887
Fascinating.

375
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,314
So I get off duty
the other night

376
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,899
and I walk into
my quarters

377
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,777
and there's Keiko
and Major Kira talking.

378
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:56,362
Go on.

379
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,572
As soon as I walked
in, they stopped.

380
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,200
It was like turning off
a holosuite program.

381
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,203
They did not want you
to hear what they were saying.

382
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,914
Exactly, but I think they
were talking about me.

383
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,290
SISKO:
Come on, Chief.

384
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,917
You have no way of knowing that.

385
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,878
Oh, I may not have the proof

386
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,963
but I know one thing--
Molly was there

387
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:16,340
and when she saw me,
she started giggling.

388
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,550
(<i> laughing</i> )

389
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,259
Laugh all you want.

390
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:22,596
I'm thinking of asking Julian
to come live with us.

391
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,473
Even things up a little.

392
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,184
(<i> console beeping</i> )

393
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:28,061
Hold on. I'm reading warp
signatures headed our way.

394
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:30,063
It looks like our signal's
finally getting

395
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:31,355
a little attention.

396
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,648
Full stop. On screen.

397
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:40,781
Make that a lot of attention.

398
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:56,589
We're being hailed.

399
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,841
They want to beam someone aboard
to discuss our request.

400
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,426
I would advise
against allowing

401
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,553
Dominion representatives
aboard this ship.

402
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:04,889
It might be better to negotiate
over the viewscreen.

403
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,306
But I don't want
to give them any reason

404
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,184
to think
that we're hiding something.

405
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:09,894
Odo needs their help and I'm
going to make sure he gets it.

406
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:11,562
Commander, tell the Jem'Hadar
that I'll meet

407
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:13,147
their representative
in the transport bay.

408
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:14,232
Aye, sir.

409
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,403
(<i> screams</i> )

410
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,907
That's enough.
Let him go.

411
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:27,578
Please, everyone.

412
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:29,205
Lower your weapons.

413
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,540
There's no need for violence.

414
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,587
Are you okay?

415
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:39,548
I've felt better.

416
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:44,053
I've come for Odo.

417
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:45,638
Can you help him?

418
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,682
Only the Great Link
can help him.

419
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,350
Leave him with me

420
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,311
and you may return home
unharmed.

421
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,562
I can't do that.

422
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,816
A Founder has given you
an order.

423
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,901
You will obey it.

424
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:02,071
I'll let you know
when I need you.

425
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:05,491
I understand
your concern for Odo.

426
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:06,826
I feel it, too.

427
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,995
Then let's not stand here
and argue.

428
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:11,371
Just tell us
where we need to take him.

429
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,916
The faster we get moving,
the better off he'll be.

430
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:17,419
Your loyalty to Odo
is commendable.

431
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,379
I will not stop you

432
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:22,758
from accompanying him
on the rest of his journey.

433
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:25,928
However, I am sure
you understand my reluctance

434
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:28,514
to reveal the location
of our new home.

435
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:35,021
Commander, I must ask you
to surrender the helm.

436
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,939
Amat'igan will
guide your ship

437
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:38,858
for the remainder
of the voyage.

438
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,358
Captain?

439
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:41,861
My terms

440
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:44,571
are not open to negotiation.

441
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:47,365
Commander, give
him your seat.

442
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:54,874
This will prevent
your navigational computers

443
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,459
from retaining any record
of our journey.

444
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,546
Sir...

445
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,380
Not now, Mr. Worf.

446
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:06,135
FOUNDER:
There, that's better.

447
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:10,597
Now, Captain,
if it's not too much trouble

448
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:14,392
I would like
to pay Odo a visit.

449
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:19,315
How do I look, Doctor?

450
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:20,900
Does it matter?

451
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,235
Of course it matters.

452
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:24,237
I'm here as
a representative

453
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:25,821
of the Cardassian Empire

454
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,448
and I want to make
a good first impression.

455
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,617
Constable, what
do you think?

456
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:34,496
I think the Romulans
poisoned Proconsul Merrok

457
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:38,292
and you were the one responsible
for the transporter accident

458
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:40,711
that killed Subcommander Ustard.

459
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:44,422
You're getting warmer,
but how do I look?

460
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:46,342
(<i> groans</i> )

461
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:47,634
(<i> door opens</i> )

462
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,305
May I come in?

463
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:54,683
You'll pardon me
if I don't get up.

464
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:58,145
Poor Odo...
look what's become of you.

465
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:01,774
Not a pretty sight, am I?

466
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:03,483
Pretty?

467
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,986
I wasn't aware
you applied such value

468
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,696
to your outward appearance.

469
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:11,617
Such concerns are
more fitting for solids.

470
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,369
Excuse me, I, um,
don't mean to interrupt

471
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:15,579
but is there anything
you can do for him?

472
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,165
Odo...

473
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,626
give me your hand.

474
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,590
Don't be afraid.

475
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,444
(<i> groaning</i> )

476
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:12,178
Amazing.

477
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:14,805
Feeling better?

478
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:20,102
Yes, though I still
have to concentrate

479
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:22,438
to hold my form.

480
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:25,649
Your molecular structure
is still fluctuating,

481
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:28,652
but it's nowhere near
as unstable as it was.

482
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,612
Leave now.

483
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,698
I wish to speak
to Odo in private.

484
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,825
Odo is my... patient.

485
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:37,036
It's all right,
Doctor.

486
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:40,622
Then I'll
be right outside.

487
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:45,044
It can wait, Garak.

488
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,962
Of course.

489
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:52,051
What we have to say
is not for your ears.

490
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,635
Wait for me outside.

491
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:05,439
I wish this meeting were
under better circumstances.

492
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:10,819
Hmm. I'm not exactly thrilled
with the circumstances myself.

493
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,906
I had hoped that you'd
return to us on your own.

494
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:17,243
After all, that Bajoran woman
you were so fond of

495
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:21,663
seems to have taken
an interest in someone else.

496
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:26,168
You know about Major Kira
and First Minister Shakaar.

497
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:28,879
Despite your
rejection of us

498
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:32,174
we still take an active interest
in your well-being.

499
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:36,636
And just how<i> do</i> you
keep so informed

500
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:39,306
about my well-being?

501
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:42,642
There's very little
that escapes our attention.

502
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:44,937
Are you saying that
you knew I was sick

503
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,772
even before we
left the station?

504
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:49,149
What do you think?

505
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,652
(<i> sighs</i> )

506
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,157
I think you did this to me.

507
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,992
You caused my illness

508
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:01,579
so that I'd be forced
to come home.

509
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:03,581
As I said

510
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:06,792
I wish the circumstances
of this meeting were different.

511
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:09,878
You killed

512
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,755
a changeling, Odo.

513
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,592
He was trying
to kill my friends.

514
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:16,260
I had no choice.

515
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,179
Of course you had a choice

516
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,723
and you chose to side
with the solids.

517
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,351
To protect them,
you were willing to violate

518
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,728
the most sacred law
of our people.

519
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:33,527
No changeling has ever
harmed another.

520
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:36,489
Until you.

521
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:40,033
That's why
we forced you to return home...

522
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:43,579
to enter the Great Link
and be judged.

523
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:56,216
What does that mean,
I'm going to be judged?

524
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,511
You will join us
in the Great Link,

525
00:27:58,511 --> 00:28:02,014
open your thoughts,
allow us to understand you.

526
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:04,517
Only then will we
be able to decide

527
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:07,186
whether your actions
were justified.

528
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,647
And if you decide
that they weren't?

529
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,483
You will be punished.

530
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:14,401
Punished how?

531
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,654
You have to understand

532
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:18,572
that nothing like this
has ever happened

533
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:21,367
in the entire history
of our people.

534
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:23,327
We have never had
to sit in judgment

535
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:25,496
over one of our own.

536
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:28,790
That's why we took so long
to bring you home.

537
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:32,919
There was... disagreement
in the Link

538
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:35,297
over what to do with you.

539
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:38,842
I'm sorry I've caused you
so much trouble.

540
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:41,554
Perhaps we are to blame.

541
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:43,722
We sent you away.

542
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:47,851
But I'm the one
who's going to be punished.

543
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:51,230
That remains to be seen.

544
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:55,401
What if I refuse to cooperate?

545
00:28:55,401 --> 00:29:00,280
What if I...
refuse to join the Link?

546
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:04,493
I stabilized
your condition temporarily.

547
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:07,496
Only the Link can heal you.

548
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:11,417
If you refuse to join with us,
you will die.

549
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:22,177
You may go in now, Doctor.

550
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,012
Thank you.

551
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,098
Try not to disturb him.

552
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,683
He needs his rest.

553
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:29,727
I'll bear that
in mind.

554
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:36,233
Excuse me, madam.

555
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:38,235
May I have
a moment of your time?

556
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:39,945
You are Cardassian.

557
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:42,531
That's right,
and on behalf of my people

558
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:45,367
I'd like to learn
if there were any survivors

559
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,327
after our attack
on your homeland.

560
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:48,787
Cardassian survivors?

561
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,206
Yes.

562
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,667
There were no
Cardassian survivors.

563
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:57,254
You mean... they're all dead?

564
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:58,964
They're dead.

565
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:00,382
<i>You're</i> dead.

566
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:03,135
Cardassia is dead.

567
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:07,514
Your people were doomed
the moment they attacked us.

568
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:10,559
I believe
that answers your question.

569
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:16,106
It was a pleasure meeting you.

570
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:34,458
O'BRIEN:
I don't suppose
there's any way

571
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:36,001
Odo could hide a
communicator on him

572
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,670
when he's in the Link
with the Founders.

573
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,505
I do not think he'll be
able to hide anything

574
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:40,631
from the Founders.

575
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:42,299
There must be
some way we can keep

576
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:43,925
a transporter lock on him
while he's in the Link.

577
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,428
What about injecting him
with radio-nuclides?

578
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:48,138
Well, that would give
the transporter

579
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:49,556
something to lock onto,

580
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,057
but there's no way
to be sure the nuclides

581
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,934
won't disperse
throughout the Link.

582
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,103
If he's in there for more than
a few hours, we could end up

583
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,896
with a transporter pad
full of shape-shifters.

584
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:58,524
ODO:
I wouldn't worry
about that, Chief.

585
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,779
SISKO:
Constable, shouldn't you
be in bed?

586
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,905
He insisted on coming
to see you himself.

587
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:08,492
ODO:
I thought you might
be trying to help me

588
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:11,620
and I wanted to say
don't bother.

589
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,079
O'BRIEN:
Odo, surely you
don't expect us

590
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,414
to just stand by

591
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,375
while they do God
knows what to you.

592
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:19,294
That is exactly what I expect.

593
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:24,257
Captain, I<i> want</i> to be judged.

594
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:27,678
I'm the only changeling
who's ever harmed another.

595
00:31:27,678 --> 00:31:31,973
I've spent most of my life
bringing people to justice.

596
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:36,395
Now that it's my turn,
how can I run away?

597
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:39,147
Are you sure
that's what you'll find

598
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,940
in the Great Link-- justice?

599
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,317
I've heard
lots of stories

600
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,069
about the Dominion
and the Founders

601
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:45,237
and justice seems to be

602
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:46,655
the last thing
on their minds.

603
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:50,325
Nevertheless, they're my people

604
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:53,328
and I intend
to accept their judgment.

605
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,666
Report.

606
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,334
Everything's
status quo.

607
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,460
If you want
more details than that

608
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,588
you'll have to ask
our navigator.

609
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:05,924
How much longer?

610
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,635
You'll be informed
when we reach our destination.

611
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:11,471
We will be within
transporter range

612
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:14,391
of my world in
less than an hour.

613
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:15,768
After we have achieved orbit

614
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:19,354
Odo and I
will transport to the surface.

615
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,981
Dr. Bashir and I
will be joining you.

616
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,026
If you wish,

617
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:28,739
but Odo may be
in the Link for days.

618
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:30,282
We'll wait.

619
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,802
Come, Odo.

620
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:51,303
It's time.

621
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:51,864
How long
has it been?

622
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:53,740
I've lost track.

623
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,450
So have I.

624
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:58,662
Doctor...

625
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:00,747
Oh...

626
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,791
oh...

627
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,334
right.

628
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:09,506
(<i> sighs</i> )

629
00:34:20,017 --> 00:34:21,518
Wait here.

630
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:32,696
Garak.

631
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:34,113
Just as I thought.

632
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,615
Don't tell me.

633
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,826
I overlooked one
of the security monitors.

634
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:40,203
You were trying to override
the launch controls

635
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,788
for the quantum torpedoes.

636
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:44,374
I was hoping to gain control
of the phasers as well.

637
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:46,334
I just hadn't got
around to it yet.

638
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,627
Don't you see?

639
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,254
We have
an opportunity here--

640
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:51,840
a chance to end
the Dominion threat

641
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,050
once and for all.

642
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:55,427
We have enough firepower
on this ship

643
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:58,096
to turn that planet
into a smoking cinder.

644
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:01,975
Personally, I think that
would be a very good thing.

645
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:03,184
And what about Odo

646
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,895
and Captain Sisko
and Dr. Bashir?

647
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:06,646
They'll die.

648
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,732
And once the Jem'Hadar ships
realize what we're doing,

649
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:10,108
so will we.

650
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,568
But what are our lives

651
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:15,822
compared to saving
the entire Alpha Quadrant?

652
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,574
We are not here to wage war.

653
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:20,744
I'm not talking about war.

654
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:25,457
What I'm proposing is wiping out
every Founder on that planet--

655
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:28,585
obliterating the Great Link.

656
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:31,546
Come now, Mr. Worf,
you're a Klingon.

657
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:34,841
Don't tell me you'd object
to a little genocide

658
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,760
in the name of self-defense.

659
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:41,098
I am a warrior,
not a murderer.

660
00:35:41,098 --> 00:35:45,894
What you are
is a great disappointment.

661
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:08,625
You fight well...

662
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:10,127
for a tailor.

663
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:17,175
Doctor.

664
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,188
(<i> groaning</i> )

665
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,700
Odo, are you all right?

666
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,787
Captain, I'm getting
some strange readings.

667
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:00,426
What have you done to him?

668
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,428
He has been judged.

669
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:04,222
Captain...

670
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,682
I'm reading a heart,

671
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:08,518
lungs...
and a digestive system.

672
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:11,479
It's as if he
were... human.

673
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,732
We gave him
what he wanted.

674
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:15,274
We made him a solid.

675
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:17,360
He's one of you now.

676
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:22,908
Oh...poor Odo.

677
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:25,660
Perhaps we should
have killed you.

678
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,914
It would have been
far less cruel.

679
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,336
He's yours.

680
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,672
Take him and go.

681
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,593
Sisko to<i> Defiant.</i>

682
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,178
DAX:
Go ahead, Captain.

683
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:44,721
Three to beam up.

684
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:09,621
Staring at it isn't going
to make it change shape.

685
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,706
It's blood, all right.

686
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:14,000
Not a trace
of changeling protoplasm

687
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,543
in your entire system.

688
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:22,550
Type "O" negative,
if you're wondering.

689
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,887
I'll be sure
to remember that.

690
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:29,557
Well, physiologically,
you're completely human.

691
00:38:31,143 --> 00:38:32,685
Except for my face.

692
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:35,354
Yes, I was wondering
about that--

693
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:37,440
why they left it unchanged.

694
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,486
They left it this way
on purpose--

695
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:44,281
to make sure
I'd never forget what I was...

696
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:48,034
and...

697
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,661
what I've lost.

698
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:04,425
SISKO:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 49962.4.</i>

699
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,552
<i>After leaving</i>
<i>our Jem'Hadar escorts</i>

700
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:08,263
<i>at the edge of Dominion space</i>

701
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:10,431
<i>the</i> Defiant<i> has returned home.</i>

702
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,142
<i>But for Constable Odo,</i>

703
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:14,936
<i>I'm afraid</i>
<i>the journey has just begun.</i>

704
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:16,479
How does it feel?

705
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:19,774
You comfortable?

706
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:22,110
Not too tight?

707
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,154
It's fine.

708
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:28,033
Though it does
make me feel a bit...

709
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:29,326
Itchy?

710
00:39:29,326 --> 00:39:31,077
It's the Inkarian wool.

711
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,704
You'll get used to it.

712
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:36,124
Unless, of course, you're
allergic to Inkarian wool.

713
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:38,043
No, it's not
the uniform.

714
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:39,418
I...

715
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:41,087
I think I'm...

716
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:43,506
hungry?

717
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,884
You know, I envy you.

718
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:49,554
Well, think of all
the wonderful foods

719
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:52,431
you'll get to enjoy
for the first time.

720
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:55,352
Hmph! I can hardly wait.

721
00:39:55,352 --> 00:39:59,356
Well, you've done your job.

722
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:02,192
Now I have to do mine.

723
00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:04,903
Yes, I suppose you do.

724
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:08,240
Six months
in a holding cell, hmm?

725
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:12,535
The thought is unattractive,
to say the least.

726
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:15,372
Well, if you ask me, Captain
Sisko let you off lightly.

727
00:40:15,372 --> 00:40:18,416
Sabotage, assaulting
a Federation officer,

728
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,876
attempting to incite war

729
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:22,628
between the Federation
and the Dominion.

730
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:26,799
Yes, but my heart
was in the right place.

731
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,260
Hmph.

732
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,928
AROYA:
There you are, Odo.

733
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:32,055
I've been looking
all over for you.

734
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:33,765
I heard about what happened.

735
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:35,058
I'm so sorry.

736
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:37,018
Oh...

737
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:38,811
thank you.

738
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:41,814
I know it won't be easy,
but eventually

739
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:46,111
you'll see how being a humanoid
has its advantages.

740
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:51,241
If there's anything at all
I can do, just let me know.

741
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,253
What a generous offer.

742
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:04,754
(<i> sighs</i> )

743
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:08,300
Let's go, Garak.

744
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:18,684
Constable?

745
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:20,103
You all right?

746
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:21,271
It's nothing.

747
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:23,273
It's just a headache.

748
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:26,609
Every once in a while, I
still get flashes of memory

749
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:28,611
from the Great Link--

750
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:31,489
a jumble of images,
or a word--

751
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,866
but I can't quite
make sense of it.

752
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:36,077
You know, there's
no reason to rush things.

753
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:38,288
You don't have to go back
to work right away.

754
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:40,248
Yes, I do!

755
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:48,214
When I joined
with the other changelings

756
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,590
in the Great Link, I...

757
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,218
felt something
I've never felt before.

758
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:55,888
In that moment...

759
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:58,641
I knew I was home.

760
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,143
For the first time

761
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:03,146
I felt that I
understood my people--

762
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:05,690
their distrust of the solids,

763
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:09,902
their willingness to do anything
to protect themselves.

764
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:12,780
And then...

765
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:16,534
in an instant,
it was all snatched away.

766
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:22,165
I'm trapped inside this body.

767
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:26,002
I can never rejoin
the Great Link.

768
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:28,963
My job is the only thing
I have left.

769
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:36,888
Besides, I'm still the best

770
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:39,598
law enforcement officer
on this station.

771
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:40,933
You're the best

772
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:43,478
law enforcement officer
in this sector--

773
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:45,480
maybe the whole damn Quadrant.

774
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,983
Maybe.

775
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:53,154
(<i> raised voices</i> )

776
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:56,282
What's that all about?
I have no idea.

777
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:59,452
The Klingon Empire
is tired of words

778
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:01,829
of negotiation,

779
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:04,457
of the endless delaying tactics
of the Federation.

780
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:07,960
Therefore, as of today,
a Klingon task force

781
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,505
has been dispatched
to the Archanis sector.

782
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:12,924
Starfleet has ten days
to abandon their bases

783
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:15,343
and withdraw their forces
from the sector.

784
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:17,762
It's coming in
on all frequencies.

785
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:20,098
...after that time
will be considered the enemy

786
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:21,433
and fired upon.

787
00:43:21,433 --> 00:43:25,186
Major, put the station
on combat alert.

788
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:27,230
Notify the Bajoran militia.

789
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:30,316
Captain...

790
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:32,735
Those in the Klingon Empire...

791
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,986
It's him.

792
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:36,114
Gowron?
What about him?

793
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:37,698
During the Link

794
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,867
I sensed that the
other changelings

795
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:42,579
were trying to hide
things from me--

796
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:45,873
faces, names...

797
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,585
one of them was him.

798
00:43:48,585 --> 00:43:50,169
What are you saying?

799
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:54,632
I'm saying
that he's one of<i> them.</i>

800
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:58,553
Gowron, the head
of the Klingon Empire,

801
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:01,347
is a changeling.

802
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:02,932
GOWRON:
Let there be no mistake,

803
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:05,143
no misinterpretation
of my words.

804
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:08,896
Archanis is ours
and we will take it back.

805
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:12,358
Resist us in any way
and there will be war.
