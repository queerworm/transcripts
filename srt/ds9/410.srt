1
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:43,752
A LOT OF KICK FOR A '45 DOM.

2
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,796
THANK YOU, MISTER...?

3
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,631
MISTER..?

4
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:52,720
BASHIR.
JULIAN BASHIR.

5
00:00:57,474 --> 00:01:01,687
(<i> clapping continues</i> )

6
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,689
WHO'S THAT?

7
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,941
AN UNINVITED GUEST.

8
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:08,402
EXCUSE ME.

9
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:13,949
NICE TUX.
THANK YOU.

10
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:16,159
NOW...
GET OUT.

11
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,328
BUT, DOCTOR, I'VE
ONLY JUST ARRIVED.

12
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,247
BREAKING INTO A HOLOSUITE
DURING SOMEONE'S PROGRAM

13
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:21,999
IS NOT ONLY RUDE,
IT'S ILLEGAL.

14
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,625
I SHOULD CALL ODO
AND HAVE YOU ARRESTED.

15
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,794
WHAT AN EXTREME REACTION
THAT WOULD BE.

16
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:28,296
YOU MUST BE VERY EMBARRASSED
BY THIS PROGRAM.

17
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:30,173
I'M NOT EMBARRASSED.

18
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,968
I'M ANNOYED THAT YOU HAVE
INTRUDED INTO MY PRIVACY.

19
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:34,553
OH, PRIVACY, INDEED.

20
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:36,430
I THINK IT GOES FAR DEEPER
THAN THAT, DOCTOR.

21
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,182
EVER SINCE YOU'VE RECEIVED
THIS NEW PROGRAM,

22
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:41,018
YOU'VE SPENT VIRTUALLY
EVERY FREE HOUR

23
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,644
IN THE HOLOSUITE.

24
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,940
BUT YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ANYONE
WHAT THE PROGRAM IS.

25
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,734
AM I SUPPOSED TO?
NO, NO. NO.

26
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:50,485
BUT YOU'RE SUCH A...

27
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:53,238
FORGIVE ME--
A TALKATIVE MAN,

28
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:56,324
AND IT'S<i> SO</i> UNUSUAL
FOR YOU TO HAVE SECRETS.

29
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,911
I MUST HAVE PICKED UP
THAT HABIT FROM YOU.

30
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:01,413
NOW, IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME.

31
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:04,374
IS THIS FANTASY OF YOURS...

32
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,961
TRULY REVEALING
OF YOUR INNER PSYCHE?

33
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:08,670
WHAT?

34
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,465
IS THAT WHY YOU'RE
SO PROTECTIVE?

35
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,801
ARE YOU AFRAID
THAT I'LL FIND OUT

36
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:18,430
SOME HUMILIATING SECRETS
OF THE REAL JULIAN BASHIR?

37
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,099
THIS IS A FANTASY.

38
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:21,767
I'M NOT HIDING ANYTHING.

39
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,936
WELL, IF YOU'VE
NOTHING TO HIDE,

40
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:27,314
THEN WHY NOT LET ME STAY?

41
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,441
ALL RIGHT.
AH.

42
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:31,068
Bashir:
NOW, I HAVE
TO BE AT WORK

43
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,778
IN TWO HOURS, AND I'D LIKE
TO ENJOY MYSELF.

44
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:34,362
SO KEEP QUIET

45
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:38,075
AND DON'T RAIN
ON MY PARADE.

46
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,701
PARADE?!

47
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:40,869
NEVER MIND.

48
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,370
DON'T WORRY, DOCTOR.

49
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,205
I CAN BE VERY
DISCREET.

50
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:45,415
YOU'LL BARELY
KNOW I'M HERE.

51
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,834
GOOD.

52
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:49,086
BUT IF I MAY MAKE
ONE OBSERVATION...

53
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:50,712
GARAK...
I ONLY WANT TO POINT OUT

54
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,674
THAT YOUR LOVELY
COMPANION IS LEAVING.

55
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:57,552
ODD. SHE SEEMED
SO INTERESTED

56
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,888
IN YOUR ADVANCES
JUST A MOMENT AGO.

57
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,891
I WONDER WHAT
SCARED HER AWAY.

58
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,103
OH, NO.

59
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:08,647
I DO APOLOGIZE.

60
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:10,816
YOU MUST BE INCENSED.

61
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:12,693
IN FACT, IF I WERE
IN YOUR SHOES

62
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:15,112
I'D GRAB A BOTTLE
OF CHAMPAGNE

63
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,780
AND SHOOT ME.

64
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,449
I CAN SEE I'M GOING
TO REGRET THIS.

65
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,326
DON'T WORRY, DOCTOR.

66
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,162
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
A WONDERFUL TIME.

67
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:26,790
AFTER ALL, WHAT COULD
POSSIBLY GO WRONG?

68
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,035
YOU LIVE HERE?

69
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,203
THAT'S RIGHT.

70
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:30,622
DECORATE IT
YOURSELF?

71
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:34,293
THE DECOR IS APPROPRIATE
FOR THE PERIOD-- 1964.

72
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:36,335
HOW DID YOU PRONOUNCE
THE NAME OF THIS CITY?

73
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:38,880
KOWLOON.
IT'S PART OF HONG KONG.

74
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,883
AND THE NIGHTCLUB WAS IN PARIS,
WHICH, IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY,

75
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:44,511
WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE PLANET.

76
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,933
MR. BASHIR,

77
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,060
I DIDN'T EXPECT
YOU HOME SO SOON.

78
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,771
I DECIDED TO LEAVE PARIS
A LITTLE EARLY.

79
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,857
ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE
MY FRIEND, MR. GARAK.

80
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,567
GARAK, THIS IS
MY PERSONAL VALET, MONA LUVSITT.

81
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,196
PLEASED TO MAKE
YOUR ACQUAINTANCE.

82
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:04,781
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CHANGE
INTO SOMETHING MORE COMFORTABLE?

83
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,867
OH, THAT WOULD BE PERFECT.
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN FIND

84
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,786
MR. GARAK SOMETHING
AS WELL.

85
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,872
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

86
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,999
WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO PUT THIS AWAY?

87
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,625
PLEASE.

88
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,129
CARE FOR A DRINK?

89
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,048
NOT JUST YET.

90
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:29,639
IS SHE YOUR VALET
OR YOUR PERSONAL ASSASSIN? 

91
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,475
VALET.
MONA'S VERY CAPABLE.

92
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,061
SHE SPEAKS SEVEN LANGUAGES,

93
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,729
HAS DEGREES IN BIOLOGY
AND CHEMISTRY

94
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,105
AND PHYSICS,
CAN FLY ANYTHING

95
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,815
FROM A JET
TO A HELICOPTER,

96
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,734
AND MAKES
AN EXCELLENT MARTINI.

97
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,153
CHEERS.

98
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,780
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
I CAN DO FOR YOU?

99
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,283
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

100
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,328
I TAKE IT
YOUR CHARACTER

101
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,080
IS SOME KIND
OF RICH DILETTANTE

102
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,874
WITH A FASCINATION
FOR WOMEN AND WEAPONS.

103
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:58,626
ACTUALLY, MY CHARACTER
IS FAR MORE DISREPUTABLE.

104
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,212
I'M A SPY.

105
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:04,258
A SPY?
AND YOU LIVE HERE?

106
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:05,508
YES. I WORK FOR ONE
OF THE NATION-STATES

107
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,761
OF THIS ERA,
GREAT BRITAIN

108
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,721
WHICH IS BATTLING
VARIOUS OTHER NATIONS

109
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,765
IN WHAT IS CALLED
THE "COLD WAR."

110
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,434
THIS APARTMENT, MY CLOTHES,
WEAPONS, EVEN MY VALET,

111
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,811
WERE PROVIDED TO ME
BY MY GOVERNMENT.

112
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:20,774
I THINK I JOINED
THE WRONG INTELLIGENCE SERVICE.

113
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,989
Sisko:
<i>ORINOCO</i> TO
DEEP SPACE NINE.

114
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,200
THIS IS CAPTAIN SISKO
REQUESTING LANDING CLEARANCE.

115
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,618
Welcome back, Captain.

116
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:34,162
YOU'RE CLEAR TO SET DOWN
ON LANDING PAD 3.

117
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,205
HOW WAS THE CONFERENCE?

118
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:36,664
INFORMATIVE, BUT I'VE GOT

119
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,666
A SHIPLOAD
OF TIRED OFFICERS HERE.

120
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,752
I THINK WE'LL BE HAPPY
TO BE IN OUR OWN BEDS TONIGHT.

121
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,337
I can imagine.

122
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,005
THERE'S SOME MESSAGE TRAFFIC

123
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,216
FROM STARFLEET COMMAND
FOR YOU TO LOOK AT...

124
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:49,803
CAPTAIN, THERE'S SOME KIND
OF POWER SURGE IN THE WARP CORE.

125
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,264
LOOKS LIKE A FLUCTUATION
IN THE PLASMA COILS.

126
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:54,599
WE BETTER TAKE THE WARP CORE
OFF-LINE.

127
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,936
I CAN'T. THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG WITH THE COMMAND

128
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,562
CONTROL SYSTEMS;
I'M COMPLETELY LOCKED OUT.

129
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,773
MAGNETIC INTERLOCKS
ARE FAILING.

130
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:03,191
WARP CORE BREACH
IS IMMINENT.

131
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,068
EJECT THE WARP CORE.

132
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,446
THE EJECTION SYSTEM
ISN'T RESPONDING.

133
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:09,948
CORRECTION:
THE EJECTION SYSTEM IS MISSING.

134
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,699
WE'VE BEEN SABOTAGED.

135
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,077
TEN SECONDS
TO WARP CORE BREACH.

136
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,163
<i>ORINOCO,</i> CUT YOUR IMPULSE
ENGINES AND DROP YOUR
DEFLECTORS.

137
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,705
WE'RE GOING TO BEAM YOU
OUT OF THERE.

138
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:21,084
ACKNOWLEDGED.
CUT MAIN POWER.

139
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:28,258
I'VE LOCKED ON. ENERGIZING.

140
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,200
Odo:
WHAT HAPPENED?

141
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,784
CAPTAIN SISKO'S
RUNABOUT

142
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,953
EXPLODED WHILE I WAS
TRYING TO BEAM THEM BACK.

143
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,538
SOME ENERGY TRAVELED BACK

144
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,290
ALONG THE TRANSPORTER BEAM
AND BLEW UP THE PRIMARY

145
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,666
ENERGIZING COILS.

146
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,210
DO STILL WE HAVE
THEIR PATTERNS?

147
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,295
YES. THEY'RE IN THE BUFFER,

148
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,714
BUT THE PATTERNS
WILL START TO DEGRADE
IF NOT USED IMMEDIATELY.

149
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,799
WE NEED TO STORE
THE PATTERNS SOMEWHERE.

150
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,386
THIS IS MORE COMPLICATED
THAN JUST AN ORDINARY
TRANSPORTER PATTERN.

151
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:14,137
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PRESERVE
ALL THE NEURAL SIGNATURES

152
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,056
OF EVERYONE ON THAT RUNABOUT.

153
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,849
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MEMORY
IT WOULD TAKE

154
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:19,809
TO SAVE JUST ONE PERSON'S
NEURAL SIGNATURE,

155
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,062
MUCH LESS FIVE?
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE
ANY CHOICE.

156
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,481
COMPUTER, I NEED TO STORE ALL
DATA CURRENTLY IN

157
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,691
THE TRANSPORTER PATTERN BUFFER

158
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,318
WHERE CAN I SAVE IT?

159
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,653
There is insufficient computer
memory to save the data.

160
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,613
PATTERN BUFFERS BEGINNING TO
LOSE COHERENCE.

161
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:35,116
THE PATTERNS WILL START TO
DEGRADE ANY SECOND NOW.

162
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:38,328
COMPUTER, WHAT IF WE WIPED
ALL COMPUTER MEMORY IN
EVERY SYSTEM ON THE STATION,

163
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,621
AND THEN STORE THE PATTERNS?

164
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:44,334
That procedure has not been
tested. It cannot be predicted.

165
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,211
THE BUFFER IS DEPOLARIZING.

166
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:49,464
COMPUTER, THIS IS A COMMAND
PRIORITY OVERRIDE.

167
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:54,177
WIPE ALL COMPUTER MEMORY
NECESSARY IN ORDER TO SAVE
THE PATTERNS FROM THE BUFFER.

168
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:57,972
AUTHORIZATION EDDINGTON,
065 ALPHA ENABLED.

169
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:01,142
Executing command override.

170
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,938
TRICORDER.

171
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,569
THE BUFFER'S LOST COHERENCE.

172
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:12,820
THE PATTERNS ARE GONE.

173
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,655
DID THE COMPUTER SAVE THEM
IN TIME?

174
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,783
I THINK SO,
BUT I'M NOT SURE WHERE.

175
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,162
THANK YOU, MY DEAR.

176
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:24,499
YES, THIS SHOULD
DO NICELY.

177
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,918
ALTHOUGH I'M NOT TOO
SURE ABOUT THE COLLAR.

178
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:28,920
IT'S PERFECT.
HUH?

179
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:33,883
I'LL HAVE THESE CLEANED
RIGHT AWAY.

180
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,510
THANK YOU.

181
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,804
ISN'T THIS A RATHER
OSTENTATIOUS LIFE FOR A SPY?

182
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,222
IT'S ALL PART
OF MY COVER.

183
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:40,474
I'M POSING AS
A WEALTHY JET-SETTER,

184
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,183
SO I HAVE TO ACT
LIKE ONE.

185
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,060
JET-SETTER?

186
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,854
PEOPLE OF THIS ERA
USED TO TRAVEL IN...

187
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,565
(<i> pounding</i> )

188
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,709
(<i> with Russian accent</i> ):
JULIAN.

189
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:12,130
I MUST HAVE FALLEN ASLEEP.

190
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,466
VERY FUNNY.

191
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:17,218
WHO ELSE DID YOU INVITE
ALONG WITH YOU TODAY?

192
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,929
WELL, THIS WASN'T
MY IDEA.

193
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,181
MAJOR?

194
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,642
COLONEL, ACTUALLY.

195
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:27,854
COLONEL ANASTASIA KOMANANOV,
K.G.B.

196
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:32,484
OH, JULIAN, I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D SEE YOU ALIVE AGAIN.

197
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:35,529
NOT AFTER YOU FELL OUT
OF THAT DIRIGIBLE OVER ICELAND.

198
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,322
I HAD A PARACHUTE,

199
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:40,116
AND THERE WAS A SUBMARINE THERE
WAITING FOR ME,

200
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,826
BUT HOW DID YOU
KNOW ABOUT THAT?

201
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,453
HAVE YOU BEEN DOWNLOADING
MY HOLOSUITE PROGRAM?

202
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:46,289
OH, JULIAN,
YOU ARE NOT WELL.

203
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:47,582
LET'S LIE DOWN.

204
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:49,584
Garak:
I MUST SAY

205
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:53,421
MAJOR KIRA'S CERTAINLY THROWING
HERSELF INTO THE ROLE, DOCTOR.

206
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:56,007
NERYS, PLEASE...

207
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:00,220
WHO IS THIS
MAJOR NERYS KIRA?

208
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,263
KIRA NERYS, ACTUALLY.

209
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,432
PERHAPS...

210
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:07,143
THIS ISN'T MAJOR KIRA AFTER ALL.

211
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,563
I'M BEGINNING
TO THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

212
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,481
COMPUTER, RESTORE
THE IMAGE

213
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:14,192
OF COLONEL KOMANANOV BACK
TO ITS ORIGINAL PARAMETERS.

214
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,069
Unable to comply.

215
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,238
The character parameters of
Colonel Komananov are correct.

216
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,656
I'D SAY SOMEONE'S

217
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,700
BEEN TAMPERING
WITH YOUR PROGRAM, DOCTOR.

218
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,202
JULIAN, WE DON'T
HAVE TIME FOR GAMES.

219
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:25,328
THERE IS MUCH TO TALK ABOUT.

220
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:26,745
EXCUSE ME.

221
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:29,332
COMPUTER,
FREEZE PROGRAM.

222
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:30,791
Unable to comply.

223
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,335
Computer control
has been disrupted

224
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:33,961
due to
a station-wide emergency.

225
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,423
EMERGENCY?
BASHIR TO OPS,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

226
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,466
WE'VE GOT OUR HANDS FULL RIGHT
NOW, DOCTOR. STAND BY.

227
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,385
ODO, WAIT.
DOCTOR, WHERE ARE YOU

228
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:42,011
AND DO YOU HAVE ACCESS
TO A WORKING COMPUTER CONSOLE?

229
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,097
I'm in Holosuite 3.

230
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,433
THE PROGRAM IS RUNNING, BUT IT
WON'T COMPLY WITH MY COMMANDS.

231
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,184
THE PROGRAM IS
STILL RUNNING?

232
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,978
I DEMAND TO KNOW
WHO YOU ARE TALKING TO.

233
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:53,648
...Julian, tell me!

234
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:56,025
THAT SOUNDED LIKE KIRA.
Bashir:
Not exactly.

235
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:59,446
SOMEONE HAS REPLACED
ONE OF THE CHARACTERS

236
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,281
WITH THE IMAGE OF MAJOR KIRA.

237
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,407
WHAT'S GOING ON?

238
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:03,824
Stay where you are, Doctor.

239
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,326
KEEP THE PROGRAM RUNNING
FOR NOW.

240
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,536
WE'LL GET RIGHT BACK TO YOU.

241
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:10,039
JULIAN, TALK TO ME.

242
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,916
TELL ME WHAT IS HAPPENING.

243
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:15,253
I'M NOT SURE MYSELF.
Eddington:
Ops to Bashir.

244
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:17,297
DOCTOR, WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T END THAT PROGRAM.

245
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,590
WHY NOT?

246
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,133
There has been
a transporter accident.

247
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,718
WE BELIEVE THE HOLOSUITE
MEMORY CORE

248
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,303
IS HOLDING THE
TRANSPORTER PATTERNS

249
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,472
OF FIVE CREW MEMBERS.
IF YOU STOP THE PROGRAM

250
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:26,973
their patterns might be lost.

251
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,350
HOW COULD THAT HAPPEN?
It's a long story,

252
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,519
BUT AT THIS MOMENT, THE PATTERNS
OF CAPTAIN SISKO,

253
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,812
KIRA, WORF, DAX
AND O'BRIEN

254
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:36,274
EXIST ONLY IN THE
HOLOSUITE DATABASE.

255
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:37,984
DON'T LEAVE THE HOLOSUITE.

256
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,570
IF YOU DO, IT MIGHT DISRUPT
THE HOLO-IMAGING ARRAY,

257
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,071
AND RIGHT NOW
WE CAN'T TAKE ANY CHANCES.

258
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,490
YOU'LL HAVE TO STAY IN THERE

259
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,241
AND KEEP THE PROGRAM RUNNING
FOR NOW.

260
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,534
UNDERSTOOD.

261
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:49,162
We'll get back to you, Doctor.

262
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,422
OH, JULIAN...

263
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:01,424
YOU ARE SO TENSE.

264
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,343
IT'S BEEN ONE OF THOSE DAYS.

265
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,970
I WISH I COULD
RELAX YOU,

266
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,223
BUT I AM HERE
ON BUSINESS.

267
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,225
IN THE LAST 24 HOURS,

268
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,770
A SERIES OF EARTHQUAKES
HAVE STRUCK CITIES

269
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,147
FROM VLADIVOSTOK
TO NEW YORK.

270
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,483
OUR SEISMOLOGISTS HAVE ANALYZED
THE EARTHQUAKES,

271
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,401
AND HAVE COME
TO THE CONCLUSION

272
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,320
THAT THEY
ARE ARTIFICIAL.

273
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,905
SO? THAT'S NOT SO DIFFICULT.

274
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,783
ONE ONLY HAS TO...
GARAK.

275
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,830
YOUR FRIEND
SEEMS TO KNOW SOMETHING.

276
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:35,166
BELIEVE ME,
HE KNOWS NOTHING.

277
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:40,963
IF YOU SAY SO.

278
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:44,300
BECAUSE OF THE GLOBAL NATURE
OF THIS CRISIS,

279
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:49,096
MY GOVERNMENT AND YOURS
HAVE DECIDED TO COOPERATE.

280
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:52,099
WE WILL
BE WORKING...

281
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,685
VERY CLOSELY.

282
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:56,479
I'M SURE WE WILL.

283
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:59,858
OUR ASSIGNMENT
IS TO FIND OUT

284
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:02,235
WHO CAUSED
THE EARTHQUAKES

285
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,862
AND WHAT THEY WANT.

286
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:05,905
A RATHER VAGUE ASSIGNMENT.

287
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,783
WE DO HAVE ONE CLUE.

288
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:11,619
ONE OF THE WORLD'S
LEADING SEISMOLOGISTS,

289
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:14,914
PROFESSOR HONEY BARE,
HAS VANISHED.

290
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:19,836
WE BELIEVE... SHE
HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED.

291
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:27,051
I DIDN'T THINK
SHE WAS YOUR TYPE.

292
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,011
YOU SAID
SHE'S BEEN KIDNAPPED.

293
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,513
WE THINK SO.

294
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,473
SHE DISAPPEARED
ONLY A FEW HOURS

295
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,726
BEFORE THE FIRST QUAKE
STRUCK NEW YORK CITY.

296
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:36,811
DOCTOR, WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF AN EMERGENCY.

297
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:40,314
IS THIS REALLY THE TIME
TO BE PLAYING GAMES?

298
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,567
LOOK!
INTERESTING.

299
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,862
IF HONEY BARE IS KILLED,
THE COMPUTER

300
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:48,364
WILL ERASE HER CHARACTER
FROM ITS PROGRAM.

301
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,117
NOW SINCE THE PROGRAM THINKS
THAT DAX<i> IS</i> HONEY BARE...

302
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:55,037
THE COMPUTER WOULD ACTUALLY BE
ERASING COMMANDER DAX'S PATTERN.

303
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:58,708
KIRA... UH, ANA...

304
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:02,629
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE PROFESSOR BARE IS?

305
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,672
SHE WAS LAST SEEN...

306
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,468
I'LL BE RIGHT
WITH YOU, MONA.

307
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,025
CHIEF...

308
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:28,488
NO.
IT'S FALCON.

309
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,783
NICE TO SEE YOU, MR. BASHIR.

310
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:35,870
NOW I THINK WE HAVE
A LITTLE UNFINISHED BUSINESS.

311
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:49,300
SURPRISED TO SEE ME,
MR. BASHIR?

312
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,802
YOU COULD SAY THAT.

313
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:52,720
WELL, YOU SHOULD USE SOMETHING

314
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,097
A LITTLE MORE LETHAL
THAN A CHAMPAGNE CORK.

315
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,724
SOMETHING...

316
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:57,684
LIKE THIS.

317
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,644
Kira:
WAIT.

318
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:02,062
WAIT, PLEASE.

319
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,190
LET US HAVE ONE LAST KISS.

320
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,403
WHY NOT?

321
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:12,156
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
A ROMANTIC AT HEART.

322
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,581
EARRING.

323
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:33,344
ALL RIGHT, BASHIR,
THAT'S ENOUGH.

324
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,523
(<i> groaning</i> )

325
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,904
INTERESTING JEWELRY.

326
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:54,156
I BOUGHT THOSE
FOR ANASTASIA LAST CHRISTMAS.

327
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,158
YOU'RE BLEEDING.

328
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,411
THE HOLOSUITE SAFETIES
MUST BE OFF.

329
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,913
TIME TO CLIP
THIS BIRD'S WINGS.

330
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,706
NO!

331
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,457
<i>NYET.</i> WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

332
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,167
WE CAN'T KILL HIM.

333
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,669
JULIAN, WHAT
ARE YOU SAYING?

334
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,671
HE'S BEEN TRYING TO KILL YOU
FOR NINE YEARS.

335
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:11,382
I WOULDN'T DISMISS HER IDEA
SO QUICKLY, DOCTOR.

336
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:12,759
BUT THAT'S MILES.

337
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,428
NO. AS YOU
POINTED OUT, HE'S FALCON--

338
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,763
A HIRED ASSASSIN
WHO'S GOING TO DO

339
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,389
EVERYTHING HE CAN
TO KILL YOU,

340
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:20,349
AND WITHOUT THE HOLOSUITE
SAFETIES IN PLACE,

341
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,935
HE MAY JUST DO THAT.

342
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:24,103
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO--
KILL HIM?

343
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,188
I WANT YOU TO STOP
TREATING THIS LIKE A GAME

344
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:30,150
WHERE EVERYTHING'S GOING TO
TURN OUT ALL RIGHT IN THE END.

345
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,987
REAL SPIES
HAVE TO MAKE HARD CHOICES.

346
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,238
YOU WANT TO SAVE DAX?

347
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,699
FINE, BUT YOU MAY NOT
HAVE THE LUXURY

348
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,076
OF SAVING EVERYONE.

349
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:39,619
WHO IS DAX?
EVENTUALLY,

350
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,913
YOU MAY HAVE
TO LET SOMEONE DIE.

351
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:43,289
I'LL DEAL WITH
THAT SITUATION

352
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,083
IF AND WHEN IT HAPPENS.

353
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,085
IN THE MEANTIME,
WE HAVE TO FIND DAX.

354
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:48,711
WHO IS DAX?

355
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:51,422
ANNA, I PROMISE I'LL EXPLAIN
EVERYTHING LATER.

356
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:54,050
NOW, YOU SAID PROFESSOR BARE
HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED.

357
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,010
DO YOU HAVE
ANY SUSPECTS?

358
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,930
WE BELIEVE THAT DR. NOAH
IS BEHIND THE ABDUCTIONS.

359
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:02,141
DURING THE LAST TWO YEARS,
HE HAS KIDNAPPED

360
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,477
AN ELITE GROUP
OF 60 ARTISANS AND SCIENTISTS

361
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:05,979
FROM AROUND THE WORLD.

362
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,731
NO ONE KNOWS WHY
OR WHERE HE HAS TAKEN THEM,

363
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:12,359
BUT OUR SOURCES TELL US
THAT EACH OF THE MISSING PEOPLES

364
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,404
WAS INVITED TO MEET DR. NOAH
AT A CLUB IN PARIS

365
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,906
SHORTLY BEFORE
THEY DISAPPEARED.

366
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,158
THE CLUB INGÉNUE.<i> </i>
<i>DA.</i>

367
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,743
I HAD A FEELING.

368
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:26,958
SORRY, MY DEAR.

369
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:31,629
I HOPE YOU REMEMBER
HOW TO TIE A BOW TIE.

370
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,840
WE'RE GOING TO PARIS.

371
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,760
WHO IS DAX?!

372
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,681
I'VE HAD TO MAKE
A FEW MODIFICATIONS

373
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,017
TO THIS HOLOSUITE
OVER THE YEARS.

374
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,726
A FEW? IT'S LIKE A JUNKYARD
IN HERE.

375
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,854
MY BROTHER WON'T LET ME
BUY NEW COMPONENTS

376
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,772
SO I'VE HAD TO SCAVENGE
FOR WHAT I NEED.

377
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,108
I'M BARELY BREAKING EVEN
ON THE HOLOSUITES AS IT IS.

378
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:54,068
IF I HAD TO BUY NEW EQUIPMENT
EVERY TIME...

379
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:56,070
WHERE'S THE CORE
MEMORY INTERFACE?

380
00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:01,117
OH... IT'S... RIGHT
BEHIND THE SPATULA.

381
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,994
THE SPATULA?

382
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:04,829
IT'S MADE OF A COPPER-
YTTERBIUM COMPOSITE--

383
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,831
THE PERFECT
PLASMA CONDUCTOR.

384
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,712
I FOUND THEM.

385
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,422
ALL FIVE OF THEIR PHYSICAL
PATTERNS ARE IN HERE...

386
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,216
AND THEY'RE STABLE.

387
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,676
WHY HERE?

388
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:20,344
THE HOLOSUITE
IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED

389
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:23,305
TO STORE
HIGHLY COMPLEX ENERGY PATTERNS.

390
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,766
THE COMPUTER'S PROCESSING
THEIR PHYSICAL PATTERNS

391
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,895
AS IF THEY WERE
HOLOSUITE CHARACTERS.

392
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,855
THE TROUBLE IS,

393
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:32,940
I'M NOT READING
ANY NEURAL ENERGY.

394
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,401
NEURAL ENERGY HAS TO BE STORED
AT THE QUANTUM LEVEL.

395
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,444
THE HOLOSUITE
CAN'T HANDLE THAT.

396
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:40,239
SO IF THEIR PHYSICAL BODIES
ARE STORED HERE,

397
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,951
WHERE ARE
THEIR BRAIN PATTERNS?

398
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,870
EVERYWHERE ELSE.

399
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,329
THEIR BRAIN PATTERNS
ARE SO LARGE

400
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,915
THAT THEY'RE TAKING UP

401
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,875
EVERY BIT OF COMPUTER MEMORY
ON THE STATION--

402
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,126
REPLICATOR MEMORY,

403
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:54,962
WEAPONS,
LIFE SUPPORTS.

404
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,673
HE MAY BE RIGHT.

405
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,675
SO WHAT DO WE DO
ABOUT IT?

406
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,636
HOW DO WE
GET THEM BACK?

407
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:09,185
♪ ♪

408
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:24,200
UH, I'D LIKE
TO SEE DR. NOAH.

409
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,952
I HAVE AN INVITATION.

410
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,320
MAY I SEE YOUR INVITATION?

411
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,696
DR. NOAH?

412
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:03,948
I AM DUCHAMPS.

413
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:07,367
I AM DR. NOAH'S...
ASSOCIATE.

00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,369
MAY I?

415
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,917
MY NAME'S MERRIWEATHER--

416
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:18,129
PATRICK MERRIWEATHER,
AND THIS IS MY WIFE

417
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:22,800
ANASTASIA,
AND MY FRIEND, MR. GARAK.

418
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,927
CHARMED.

419
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,767
YOUR INVITATION,
MR. MERRIWEATHER.

420
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,270
I... DON'T HAVE ONE.

421
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:39,192
DR. NOAH DOES NOT LIKE
UNEXPECTED GUESTS.

422
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:42,069
OH, I BELIEVE DR. NOAH
WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED

423
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,322
IN MEETING MY HUSBAND.

424
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:46,740
HE'S ONE OF
THE LEADING GEOLOGISTS

425
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,284
IN THE WORLD.

426
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:54,332
NOW, WHY WOULD THAT
INTEREST DR. NOAH?

427
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:55,749
OH, WE BELIEVE HE'S TAKEN

428
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,835
QUITE AN INTEREST
IN THE SCIENCES.

429
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,879
AFTER ALL, HE HAS
INVITED SEVERAL

430
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:04,008
OF THE WORLD'S TOP SCIENTISTS
TO THIS... CLUB.

431
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:05,551
ISN'T THAT TRUE?

432
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,928
I MUST SAY,
I FEEL A LITTLE INSULTED

433
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:11,224
BY BEING LEFT OUT
OF SUCH AN ILLUSTRIOUS GROUP.

434
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:13,517
HOW UNFORTUNATE.

435
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,312
OF COURSE...

436
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:19,648
A MEETING STILL CAN BE ARRANGED
FOR A PRICE.

437
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:20,858
OH?

438
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:23,194
FIVE MILLION FRANCS.

439
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,701
NO PROBLEM.

440
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:35,413
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

441
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:37,124
WHERE'S THE REST
OF YOUR MONEY?

442
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,293
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.

443
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,505
SHALL WE BEGIN?

444
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,383
Odo:
A CARDASSIAN
SEPARATIST GROUP

445
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:47,093
CALLING THEMSELVES
"THE TRUE WAY"

446
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:48,886
HAS CLAIMED
RESPONSIBILITY

447
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:50,512
FOR SABOTAGING
THE RUNABOUT.

448
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,306
EVER HEARD
OF THEM BEFORE?

449
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:54,516
MMM. THEY'RE OPPOSED
TO THE PEACE TREATY.

450
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:57,477
THEY BLAME THE FEDERATION
FOR CARDASSIA'S ECONOMIC

451
00:23:57,477 --> 00:24:00,314
AND POLITICAL TROUBLES,
ET CETERA, ET CETERA.

452
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:03,234
UNTIL NOW, THEY'VE NEVER
COMMITTED ANY TERRORIST ACTIONS

453
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:04,735
TO SUPPORT THEIR BELIEFS.

454
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,528
WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND?

455
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:10,532
FROM WHAT WE CAN TELL,
QUARK WAS RIGHT.

456
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,785
THE COMPUTER HAS STORED
THE NEURAL ENERGY PATTERNS

457
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:15,204
OF EVERYONE ON THE RUNABOUT
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATION.

458
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:17,039
DON'T EVERYONE
THANK ME AT ONCE.

459
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,708
WHAT WE NEED TO DO
IS REINTEGRATE
THEIR NEURAL PATTERNS

460
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,794
WITH THEIR PHYSICAL PATTERNS
FROM THE HOLOSUITE

461
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,337
AND RE-MATERIALIZE THEM.

462
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:24,964
Eddington:
I SAY WE USE THE<i> DEFIANT.</i>

463
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,590
ITS POWER SYSTEMS
AND COMPUTERS

464
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,342
ARE INDEPENDENT
OF THE STATION

465
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:30,177
AND IT HAS ITS
OWN TRANSPORTER.

466
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,972
SOUNDS GOOD, EXCEPT...

467
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,807
EXCEPT WHAT?

468
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,309
WELL, MY EQUIPMENT
ISN'T DESIGNED

469
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:38,436
TO INTERFACE WITH
STARFLEET SYSTEMS.

470
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:41,772
I MAY HAVE TO MAKE
SOME MODIFICATIONS.

471
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:07,798
CARD.

472
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:17,975
NINE.

473
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:23,397
FIVE MILLION FRANCS.

474
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,152
YOU'RE QUITE A BACCARAT PLAYER,
MR. MERRIWEATHER.

475
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:31,864
BACCARAT AND GEOLOGY
ARE MY LIFE.

476
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:36,494
NOW, MR. DUCHAMPS, I BELIEVE
I'VE MET YOUR CONDITIONS.

477
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,080
WHEN DO WE LEAVE?

478
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,084
RIGHT NOW.

479
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:16,325
(<i> speaking Russian</i> )

480
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:19,412
ANOTHER DECORATOR'S
NIGHTMARE.

481
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:22,873
THIS ERA HAD
A DISTINCT LACK OF TASTE.

482
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:24,375
WHERE ARE WE?

483
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:27,711
WELCOME TO PARADISE,
MR. MERRIWEATHER.

484
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,672
I BELIEVE
YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR ME.

485
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:35,052
MY NAME IS HIPPOCRATES NOAH.

486
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:44,644
MR. MERRIWEATHER...

487
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:47,440
I UNDERSTAND
YOUR FIELD IS GEOLOGY.

488
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,733
THAT'S RIGHT.

489
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,609
THEN I AM SURE
YOU CAN APPRECIATE

490
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:55,155
THE STONES IN MY MOST
RECENT ACQUISITION.

491
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:57,450
A MOST STRIKING
DISPLAY...

492
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:00,618
OF RUBIES...
TOURMALINE...

493
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:03,205
SAPPHIRE... TOPAZ...

494
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:05,958
AND JUDGING BY THE HIGH CHROMIUM
CONTENT OF THE RUBIES,

495
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,085
I'D SAY THEY COME FROM

496
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:12,465
THE HYDROTHERMAL DEPOSITS
ON THE TIBETAN PLATEAU...

497
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:14,632
WHICH ISN'T SURPRISING

498
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:17,635
CONSIDERING WE'RE ON
THE SOUTHEASTERN SLOPE

499
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:23,350
OF MT. EVEREST AT ABOUT
22,000 FEET, I SHOULD SAY.

500
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,978
25, ACTUALLY.

501
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:29,022
YOU MUST NOT GET MANY TOURISTS.

502
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:37,281
MY GUESTS AND I
PLACE A PREMIUM ON OUR PRIVACY.

503
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:39,699
WE DON'T WANT
ANY UNWELCOME GUESTS,

504
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:41,994
SUCH AS MEN SENT BY GOVERNMENTS

505
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:46,081
WHO DISAGREE
WITH MY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY.

506
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:49,042
AND WHAT IS YOUR PHILOSOPHY?

507
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:51,420
ARE YOU
SOME KIND OF ANARCHIST?

508
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,213
QUITE THE OPPOSITE.

509
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:57,384
I BELIEVE IN AN ORDERLY WORLD...

510
00:27:57,384 --> 00:28:01,180
A FAR CRY FROM THE CHAOS
WE FIND OURSELVES IN TODAY.

511
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:05,058
WE ARE BUILDING
A NEW FUTURE HERE,

512
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:08,145
A NEW BEGINNING
FOR MANKIND.

513
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:11,398
A NEW CHAPTER
IN HUMAN HISTORY

514
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,942
WILL OPEN RIGHT HERE
ON MY ISLAND.

515
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,361
ISLAND?

516
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,824
FORGIVE ME.

517
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:23,869
SOMETIMES I DO
GET AHEAD OF MYSELF.

518
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:26,288
ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN.

519
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:35,964
WE'RE ALMOST READY.

520
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,008
I PROGRAMMED
THE LASER SEQUENCE,

521
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:39,552
AND I'M MAKING SOME
LAST-MINUTE ADJUSTMENTS

522
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,428
TO THE SOUTH AMERICAN SITE.

523
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:44,723
I DO HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE
IN YOU, MY DEAR.

524
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,933
SHE'S WORKING WITH HIM.

525
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:49,228
YOU SEE, MR. MERRIWEATHER,

526
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,855
NOT ONLY DO I INTEND
TO CREATE A NEW FUTURE,

527
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,567
I INTEND TO CREATE
A NEW WORLD.

528
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:56,235
AT EACH ONE OF THESE POINTS,

529
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:58,862
I HAVE HIDDEN
A NEW FORM OF LASER--

530
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:01,114
ONE THAT CAN PENETRATE
THE EARTH'S CRUST

531
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,325
DOWN INTO THE MANTLE ITSELF.

532
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:06,119
THE GLOBAL EARTHQUAKES.

533
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,247
THOSE WERE ONLY TESTS.

534
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:12,418
SOON I WILL ACTIVATE
ALL OF THESE LASERS TOGETHER

535
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:15,254
AND WHEN I DO,
THEY WILL PRODUCE

536
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:17,423
WORLDWIDE EARTHQUAKES
THE LIKES OF WHICH

537
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:19,883
WE HAVE NEVER
FELT BEFORE.

538
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,428
KILLING EVERYONE
ON THE PLANET.

539
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:25,055
MORE THAN THAT.

540
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:28,934
THERE COMES A TIME
WHEN A HOUSE HAS BEEN

541
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:31,270
SO DAMAGED BY TERMITES

542
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:34,022
THAT YOU MUST NOT ONLY
KILL THE TERMITES,

543
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:38,151
BUT DEMOLISH THE HOUSE
AND BUILD AGAIN.

544
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:43,323
THE QUAKES ARE ONLY
A MINOR SIDE EFFECT.

545
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:46,744
THE REAL GOAL OF THIS PROJECT

546
00:29:46,744 --> 00:29:50,456
IS TO HAVE THESE LASERS OF MINE

547
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:54,042
PRODUCE MASSIVE FISSURES
IN THE EARTH'S CRUST,

548
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:58,380
RELEASING MILLIONS OF TONS
OF MOLTEN LAVA.

549
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:05,512
NOW, MR. MERRIWEATHER,
YOU'RE THE GEOLOGIST.

550
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:09,182
TELL ME, WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

551
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:12,603
ONCE THAT MUCH LAVA
IS RELEASED,

552
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:15,481
THE TECTONIC PLATES
WOULD BEGIN TO SETTLE.

553
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:19,109
AND THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET
WILL SHRINK

554
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:22,571
JUST LIKE LETTING AIR
OUT OF A BALLOON.

555
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:27,660
BUT IF THE SURFACE
OF THE EARTH SHRINKS,

556
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,035
THE OCEANS...

557
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:31,830
WILL COVER THE EARTH.

558
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,624
DIABOLICAL.

559
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:36,669
VISIONARY.

560
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:42,132
I AM GOING TO LET
MANKIND BEGIN ANEW...

561
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:46,720
HERE... ON THIS ISLAND PARADISE.

562
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,098
THE ONLY PLACE
THAT WILL REMAIN ABOVE WATER

563
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:53,560
ON MY BRAVE NEW WORLD.

564
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,689
AND THAT IS WHY I HAVE GATHERED

565
00:30:56,689 --> 00:31:01,568
THE FINEST MINDS, THE VERY BEST
THAT MANKIND HAS TO OFFER.

566
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:05,823
WE WILL REPOPULATE
AND START A NEW HUMAN RACE.

567
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:09,034
PITY
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO JOIN US.

568
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,578
ARE YOU REVOKING
MY INVITATION?

569
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:17,835
OH, I INTEND TO DO MORE
THAN THAT, MR. BASHIR.

570
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:23,089
NOT ONLY HAVE I BROUGHT
THE GREATEST MINDS

571
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,759
TO MY MOUNTAIN RETREAT,

572
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:30,889
BUT I HAVE ALSO HIRED
THE GREATEST PROTECTION

573
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,975
THAT MONEY CAN BUY.

574
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:39,565
I BELIEVE
YOU ALREADY KNOW...

575
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:42,234
MY NEWEST EMPLOYEE.

576
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,410
IS ALL THIS
REALLY NECESSARY?

577
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,328
IT'S THE BEST I CAN DO.

578
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,456
HOW LONG UNTIL
WE'RE READY

579
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,250
TO TRY RETRIEVING
THEIR PATTERNS?

580
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,044
I'D SAY ANOTHER HOUR.

581
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,713
(<i> sighs</i> )

582
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:05,215
O'BRIEN'S GOING TO KILL ME
WHEN HE GETS BACK.

583
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:17,561
THIS IS ONE OF 74 LASERS

584
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:19,855
THAT I'VE DEPLOYED
AROUND THE WORLD.

585
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:21,440
WHEN I THROW THAT SWITCH,

586
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,233
IT WILL BEGIN
A FIVE-MINUTE COUNTDOWN

587
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:25,903
THAT EVEN I CAN'T STOP.

588
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:29,114
AND ONCE THE LASER FIRES,
THE WHOLE CAVE

589
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:31,533
WILL BE FILLED
WITH MOLTEN LAVA.

590
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:34,244
WHERE'S COLONEL KOMANANOV?

591
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:36,663
SHE'S A SPIRITED
INDIVIDUAL.

592
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:39,082
YOUNG...
HEALTHY.

593
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,584
WE'LL NEED WOMEN LIKE HER

594
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:43,295
TO HELP PROPAGATE
THE SECOND HUMAN RACE.

595
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:51,136
TRY TO STAY COOL, MR. BASHIR.

596
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,946
Garak:
SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

597
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:11,740
Bashir: I'M THINKING.
THINK FAST.

598
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:15,911
I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE MADE THIS
EXPLICIT TO YOU OR NOT, DOCTOR,

599
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:20,749
BUT I REALLY DON'T WANT TO DIE
CHAINED TO A 20th-CENTURY LASER.

600
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:22,876
I THINK IT'S TIME TO END
THIS PROGRAM.

601
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:24,544
WE CAN'T DO THAT.

602
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,630
WE'D WIPE OUT THE PATTERNS
OF SISKO AND THE OTHERS.

603
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,842
THEN MAY I SUGGEST CALLING
COMMANDER EDDINGTON

604
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:31,551
AND HAVING HIM
SEND SOMEONE IN HERE

605
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:34,053
TO REMOVE THESE HANDCUFFS?

606
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:36,515
YOU HEARD WHAT ODO SAID--
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'LL HAPPEN

607
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,308
IF WE INTERRUPT
THE HOLO-IMAGING ARRAY

608
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:40,018
BY CALLING FOR THE DOORS.

609
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,937
THE ENTIRE PROGRAM MIGHT
COLLAPSE AND KILL THEM ALL.

610
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:44,481
WELL, I ONLY KNOW
ONE THING FOR SURE, DOCTOR,

611
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:47,651
THAT WHEN THE MOLTEN LAVA
BEGINS POURING INTO THIS CAVE,

612
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:51,947
YOU AND I ARE GOING TO BE
VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.

613
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:53,490
(<i> footsteps approaching)</i>

614
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,951
WHO'S THAT?

615
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:57,870
IT'S OUR TICKET OUT OF HERE.

616
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:04,042
WHAT A WASTE...

617
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,920
THAT NO ONE CAN SEE
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN YOU ARE.

618
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,588
IS THAT YOUR PLAN?

619
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,089
SHUT UP.

620
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:15,470
NOAH ONLY WANTS YOU
FOR YOUR MIND.

621
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,765
HE CAN'T APPRECIATE
THE WOMAN INSIDE YOU.

622
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:22,352
HONEY,
WOULD YOU GRANT ME

623
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:27,273
ONE LAST REQUEST
AND TAKE OFF THOSE GLASSES?

624
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,286
LIKE THIS?

625
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,163
YES.

626
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:51,256
YOU KNOW,

627
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:55,176
YOUR HAIR WOULD LOOK
SO MUCH BETTER

628
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,678
IF IT WERE FREE.

629
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:57,971
I MUST SAY, DOCTOR,

630
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:59,806
THIS IS MORE THAN I EVER
WANTED TO KNOW

631
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,808
ABOUT YOUR FANTASY LIFE.

632
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:16,239
THERE...

633
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:19,701
THAT'S THE LAST THING
I WANT TO REMEMBER

634
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:21,995
BEFORE I DIE.

635
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,457
THANK YOU.

636
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:43,934
I'D GIVE YOU BOTH
SOME PRIVACY IF I COULD.

637
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:53,902
GREAT PLAN.

638
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:56,404
NOW CAN WE CALL EDDINGTON?

639
00:35:57,823 --> 00:36:01,660
THAT WILL NOT BE NECESSARY.

640
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,370
HONEY HAS GIVEN ME
ALL WE NEED.

641
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,665
KISS THE GIRL,
GET THE KEY.

642
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:08,500
THEY NEVER TAUGHT ME THAT
IN THE OBSIDIAN ORDER.

643
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:12,754
COME ON!

644
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,483
WE HAVE TO GET
TO THE CONTROL ROOM.

645
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:34,943
WHAT?!

646
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:37,195
IF THIS PROGRAM ENDS
LIKE THE OTHERS,

647
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:40,991
EITHER KOMANANOV OR HONEY BARE
WILL BE KILLED BY DR. NOAH.

648
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:43,493
THE OTHER'S SUPPOSED TO
END UP WITH ME.

649
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:45,370
IN EITHER CASE,

650
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,246
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE
THAT BOTH OF THEM SURVIVE.

651
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,666
YOU EXPECT TO TAKE ON NOAH
AND HIS MEN WITH THAT?

652
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:51,334
IT'S MY FANTASY.

653
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,377
TRUST ME.

654
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,880
NO!

655
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,673
THIS HAS GONE FAR ENOUGH.

656
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:58,466
IT'S TIME TO CUT OUR LOSSES.

657
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,677
WE CAN'T DO THAT.
KIRA OR DAX MIGHT...

658
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:03,555
YES, THEY MIGHT BE KILLED,
AND THAT IS UNFORTUNATE

659
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:06,016
BUT THERE COMES A TIME
WHEN THE ODDS ARE AGAINST YOU,

660
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:08,518
AND THE ONLY REASONABLE
COURSE OF ACTION IS TO QUIT.

661
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:09,728
QUIT?

662
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,396
YES!

663
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:14,107
IS THAT WHAT THEY TAUGHT YOU
IN THE OBSIDIAN ORDER?

664
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:15,400
TO GIVE UP
WHEN THINGS GET TOUGH?

665
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,069
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
THEY DID.

666
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:18,945
THAT'S WHY I'VE MANAGED
TO STAY ALIVE

667
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,906
WHILE MOST OF MY
COLLEAGUES ARE DEAD--

668
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:22,908
BECAUSE I KNOW
WHEN TO WALK AWAY,

669
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:25,368
AND THAT TIME
IS NOW. NOW!

670
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,204
AND YOU'D KNOW THAT,
DOCTOR, IF YOU WERE

671
00:37:27,204 --> 00:37:29,164
A<i> REAL</i>
INTELLIGENCE AGENT.

672
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:31,708
OH, SO THAT'S
WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT.

673
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:33,752
THE FACT THAT MY FANTASY
HAPPENS TO STEP ON

674
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:36,004
WHAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE
YOUR PRIVATE DOMAIN.

675
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:37,881
WHAT'S THE MATTER, GARAK?

676
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:39,966
HAVE I BRUISED YOUR EGO
BY PLAY-ACTING AT SOMETHING

677
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,634
YOU TAKE SO VERY SERIOUSLY?

678
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,970
THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE
YOU'VE YET TO LEARN, DOCTOR.

679
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:47,933
A REAL INTELLIGENCE AGENT
HAS NO EGO, NO CONSCIENCE,

680
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:52,104
NO REMORSE-- ONLY A SENSE
OF PROFESSIONALISM,

681
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:55,648
AND MINE IS TELLING ME
THAT IT'S TIME TO GO.

682
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:58,568
COMPUTER!
DON'T!

683
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,570
OR WHAT?

684
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,321
YOU'LL KILL ME?

685
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:05,242
IF YOU CALL FOR THE EXIT,

686
00:38:05,242 --> 00:38:07,493
YOU MIGHT KILL SISKO
AND THE OTHERS,

687
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:09,704
AND I AM NOT PREPARED
TO RISK THAT.

688
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:13,458
I'M AFRAID I DON'T BELIEVE
YOU'LL PULL THAT TRIGGER.

689
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,710
I WOULDN'T BE SO SURE
ABOUT THAT.

690
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:19,089
IT'S TIME
TO FACE REALITY, DOCTOR.

691
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:21,841
YOU'RE A MAN
WHO DREAMS OF BEING A HERO

692
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:26,429
BECAUSE YOU KNOW, DEEP DOWN,
THAT YOU'RE NOT.

693
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,098
I'M NO HERO EITHER,

694
00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:32,060
BUT I DO KNOW
HOW TO MAKE A CHOICE,

695
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:36,273
AND I AM CHOOSING
TO SAVE MYSELF.

696
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:40,485
COMPUTER, SHOW ME
THE MECHANISM...

697
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:51,037
YOU'LL BE FINE.

698
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,747
IT'S JUST A FLESH WOUND.

699
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:56,668
THAT WAS AWFULLY CLOSE.

700
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:58,586
WHAT IF YOU'D KILLED ME?

701
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:01,464
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I WASN'T TRYING?

702
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:06,385
DOCTOR, I DO BELIEVE
THERE'S HOPE FOR YOU YET.

703
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:08,680
I'M SO RELIEVED.

704
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,473
NOW WE HAVE TO GET
TO THE CONTROL ROOM.

705
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,391
ARE YOU COMING OR NOT?

706
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:18,898
WELL, WHO AM I TO QUESTION
JULIAN BASHIR, SECRET AGENT?

707
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,900
LEAD ON.

708
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,069
EVERYBODY STAY
WHERE YOU ARE.
JULIAN.

709
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,322
YOUR WEAPON, DR. NOAH.

710
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:27,406
THIS IS YOUR DOING.

711
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:30,743
YOU LET THEM GO.
I'M SORRY, DOCTOR.

712
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,579
JULIAN, YOU ARE JUST IN TIME.
HE WAS ABOUT TO ACTIVATE

713
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,999
THE FINAL SEQUENCE
OF THE LASERS.

714
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:37,125
KILL HIM, JULIAN.

715
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:39,044
NOT THIS TIME, ANA.

716
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:41,129
THEN I WILL.
NO!

717
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:42,255
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

718
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:44,299
MAKING A MISTAKE.

719
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:47,510
THANK YOU,
MR. DUCHAMPS.

720
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,262
Eddington to Bashir.

721
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:50,596
We're going to try
rematerializing

722
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,265
their patterns
in about two minutes.

723
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:54,976
UNDERSTOOD.

724
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:58,980
AND WHAT IS IT YOU UNDERSTAND,
MR. BASHIR?

725
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,566
THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE KILLED ME
WHEN YOU HAD THE CHANCE?

726
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:04,152
I AGREE.

727
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:10,242
BUT, THEN AGAIN, I SUPPOSE
IT WOULDN'T BE VERY... HEROIC.

728
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:13,328
I, ON THE OTHER HAND,

729
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:18,375
HAVE NO PRETENSIONS
ABOUT THE IDEA OF BEING A HERO.

730
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:19,709
WAIT!

731
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:25,548
MAYBE I'M TIRED
OF BEING A HERO.

732
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,133
MAYBE I'VE THOUGHT OVER
WHAT YOU'VE SAID,

733
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:31,179
AND DECIDED
THAT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

734
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:32,889
ABOUT WHAT?

735
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:34,266
EVERYTHING--
THE DECADENCE

736
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:35,892
OF THE WORLD,
THE NEED FOR ORDER.

737
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:37,894
THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT,
THE MORE I REALIZE

738
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:41,940
THAT YOUR WAY
MAY BE THE ONLY WAY.

739
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,235
HA!

740
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:56,454
<i>YOU</i> EXPECT<i> ME</i> 
TO BELIEVE THAT?

741
00:40:57,747 --> 00:41:01,084
YOU ARE JULIAN BASHIR,

742
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:04,254
A MAN WHO HAS SPENT
HIS ENTIRE LIFE

743
00:41:04,254 --> 00:41:06,298
DEDICATED TO FIGHTING AGAINST...

744
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:07,882
YES!

745
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:10,218
BUT THAT'S ALL ABOUT
TO END NOW, ISN'T IT?

746
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:12,553
YOU'RE GOING TO DESTROY THIS
WORLD AND START A NEW ONE.

747
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:15,640
WHAT'S THE USE OF ME CONTINUING
TO DEFEND A DOOMED PLANET?

748
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,976
CAN YOU SEE
THE SENSE IN THAT?

749
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:23,648
NO.
NO.

750
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:26,151
I'M AN INTELLIGENCE AGENT,

751
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:28,486
AND IF THERE'S
ANY ONE THING I'VE LEARNED,

752
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,697
IT IS THAT THERE COMES A POINT
WHEN THE ODDS ARE AGAINST YOU

753
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:34,700
AND THERE IS NO REASONABLE
COURSE OF ACTION BUT TO QUIT.

754
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,996
HOW DO YOU THINK I'VE MANAGED
TO STAY ALIVE SO LONG

755
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:40,248
WHEN ALL OF MY COMPATRIOTS
ARE DEAD?

756
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:43,876
IT IS BECAUSE I HAVE KNOWN
WHEN TO WALK AWAY.

757
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:53,511
ROM TO OPS, I'M READY.

758
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,472
YOU CAN START TRANSFERRING
THE NEURAL ENERGY

759
00:41:55,472 --> 00:41:56,681
TO THE<i> DEFIANT.</i>

760
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:57,807
Acknowledged.

761
00:41:57,807 --> 00:41:59,476
BEGINNING DATA TRANSFER.

762
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:05,564
YOU MAKE A VERY INTERESTING
ARGUMENT, MR. BASHIR.

763
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:09,194
BUT I'M AFRAID I'VE BEEN
LOOKING FORWARD TO KILLING YOU

764
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:11,237
FOR A LONG TIME.

765
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:14,032
YOU NEED TO MOVE BEYOND THAT.

766
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:18,328
YOU NEED TO START THINKING
ABOUT YOUR NEW WORLD ORDER.

767
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:20,913
YOU MAY EVEN NEED
SOMEONE LIKE ME.

768
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:24,625
IF YOU THINK
THAT BY GOING OVER THERE,

769
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:27,962
YOU ARE GOING TO DESTROY
MY CONTROL CONSOLE,

770
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,715
YOU ARE WASTING YOUR TIME.

771
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:38,556
I DON'T INTEND
TO DESTROY YOUR CONSOLE, DOCTOR.

772
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,641
I INTEND TO USE IT.

773
00:42:42,394 --> 00:42:44,979
YOU'VE JUST ACTIVATED
THE FINAL LASER SEQUENCE.

774
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,525
YOU'VE DESTROYED THE WORLD.

775
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,030
Odo:
DATA TRANSFER COMPLETE.

776
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,865
I AM REESTABLISHING
COMPUTER CONTROL

777
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:57,616
OVER THE STATION.

778
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:04,707
O'Brien:
<i>IT'S WORKING</i>
<i>JUST AS YOU PLANNED.</i>

779
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:06,292
YOU'VE DONE IT DOCTOR.

780
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,503
YES.

781
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:12,924
BUT SOMEHOW,
I DIDN'T EXPECT TO WIN.

782
00:43:15,427 --> 00:43:17,095
I SUPPOSE

783
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:21,391
THE ONLY THING LEFT TO DO NOW
IS TO KILL YOU.

784
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:33,278
WHAT HAPPENED, COMMANDER?

785
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:34,862
WHAT DID YOU DO
TO MY SHIP?

786
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,989
Eddington:
IT'S GOING TO TAKE
SOME EXPLAINING.

787
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:40,535
EDDINGTON TO BASHIR.
WE'VE GOT THEM, DOCTOR.

788
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:42,703
You can leave the holosuite now.

789
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,456
THANK YOU.

790
00:43:44,456 --> 00:43:46,291
INTERESTING.

791
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:49,210
YOU SAVED THE DAY
BY DESTROYING THE WORLD.

792
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:50,920
I BET THEY DIDN'T
TEACH YOU<i> THAT</i>

793
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,547
AT THE OBSIDIAN ORDER.

794
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:57,218
NO, THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL
THEY DIDN'T TEACH ME.

795
00:43:57,218 --> 00:44:00,972
LIKE THE VALUE
OF A GOOD GAME OF CHANCE,

796
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:04,934
OR HOW INDULGING
IN FANTASY

797
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:07,937
KEEPS THE MIND CREATIVE.

798
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:10,356
LUNCH TOMORROW?

799
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:11,941
OF COURSE.

800
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:14,611
BUT WHY DON'T WE
HAVE IT AT YOUR PLACE...

801
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:16,613
IN HONG KONG.

802
00:44:16,613 --> 00:44:20,241
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
THIS WAS YOUR LAST MISSION.

803
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:23,035
OH, I THINK
IT'S SAFE TO SAY

804
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:27,665
THAT JULIAN BASHIR,
SECRET AGENT, WILL RETURN.

805
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,708
HMM...
