1
00:00:42,082 --> 00:00:45,078
A lot of kick for a '45 Dom.

2
00:00:45,123 --> 00:00:47,424
Thank you, Mister?

3
00:00:47,462 --> 00:00:48,988
Mister?

4
00:00:49,032 --> 00:00:51,025
Bashir.

5
00:00:52,306 --> 00:00:54,003
Julian Bashir.

6
00:01:02,928 --> 00:01:04,557
Who's that?

7
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,400
An uninvited guest.

8
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,272
Excuse me.

9
00:01:14,287 --> 00:01:15,414
Nice tux.
Thank you.

10
00:01:15,456 --> 00:01:16,424
Now...

11
00:01:16,459 --> 00:01:17,484
get out.

12
00:01:17,528 --> 00:01:19,259
But, Doctor,
I've only just arrived.

13
00:01:19,365 --> 00:01:22,064
Breaking into a holosuite
during someone's program

14
00:01:22,104 --> 00:01:23,767
is not only rude,
it's illegal.

15
00:01:23,807 --> 00:01:25,834
I should call Odo
and have you arrested.

16
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:27,940
What an extreme reaction
that would be.

17
00:01:27,983 --> 00:01:30,284
You must be very embarrassed
by this program.

18
00:01:30,355 --> 00:01:31,654
I'm not embarrassed.

19
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:34,186
I'm annoyed that you have
intruded into my privacy.

20
00:01:34,231 --> 00:01:35,598
Oh, privacy, indeed.

21
00:01:35,634 --> 00:01:38,037
I think it goes far deeper
than that, Doctor.

22
00:01:38,073 --> 00:01:40,306
Ever since you've received
this new program,

23
00:01:40,411 --> 00:01:42,541
you've spent virtually
every free hour

24
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:43,812
in the holosuite.

25
00:01:43,851 --> 00:01:47,484
But you haven't told anyone
what the program is.

26
00:01:47,527 --> 00:01:48,826
Am I supposed to?

27
00:01:48,862 --> 00:01:50,491
No, no. No.

28
00:01:50,533 --> 00:01:53,334
But you're such a...
forgive me...

29
00:01:53,406 --> 00:01:54,670
a talkative man

30
00:01:54,709 --> 00:01:57,510
and it's so unusual
for you to have secrets.

31
00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:00,545
I must have picked up
that habit from you.

32
00:02:00,589 --> 00:02:02,958
Now, if you will excuse me.

33
00:02:02,994 --> 00:02:05,830
Is this fantasy of yours...

34
00:02:05,867 --> 00:02:08,806
truly revealing
of your inner psyche?

35
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,808
What?

36
00:02:09,843 --> 00:02:13,112
Is that why you're
so protective?

37
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,781
Are you afraid
that I'll find out

38
00:02:15,822 --> 00:02:19,991
some humiliating secrets
of the real Julian Bashir?

39
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,159
This is a fantasy.

40
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,999
I'm not hiding anything.

41
00:02:23,038 --> 00:02:27,537
Well, if you've nothing to hide,
then why not let me stay?

42
00:02:29,385 --> 00:02:30,786
- All right.
- Ah.

43
00:02:30,822 --> 00:02:33,726
Now, I have to be at work
in two hours, and I'd like

44
00:02:33,761 --> 00:02:34,888
to enjoy myself.

45
00:02:34,931 --> 00:02:39,202
So keep quiet
and don't rain on my parade.

46
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,711
Parade?!

47
00:02:41,746 --> 00:02:42,714
Never mind.

48
00:02:42,748 --> 00:02:43,875
Don't worry, Doctor.

49
00:02:43,917 --> 00:02:45,819
I can be very discreet.

50
00:02:45,855 --> 00:02:47,324
You'll barely know I'm here.

51
00:02:47,358 --> 00:02:48,383
Good.

52
00:02:48,427 --> 00:02:50,625
But if I may make
one observation...

53
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,192
- Garak...
- I only want to point out

54
00:02:52,235 --> 00:02:56,233
that your lovely companion
is leaving.

55
00:02:56,277 --> 00:02:57,245
Odd.

56
00:02:57,279 --> 00:02:58,508
She seemed so interested

57
00:02:58,549 --> 00:03:00,416
in your advances
just a moment ago.

58
00:03:00,453 --> 00:03:05,192
I wonder what scared her away.

59
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:07,201
Oh, no.

60
00:03:07,235 --> 00:03:09,068
I do apologize.

61
00:03:10,575 --> 00:03:11,702
You must be incensed.

62
00:03:11,745 --> 00:03:14,182
In fact,
if I were in your shoes

63
00:03:14,217 --> 00:03:18,056
I'd grab a bottle of champagne
and shoot me.

64
00:03:18,092 --> 00:03:20,495
I can see I'm going
to regret this.

65
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:22,398
Don't worry, Doctor.

66
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,404
We're going to have
a wonderful time.

67
00:03:24,506 --> 00:03:28,504
After all, what could
possibly go wrong?

68
00:05:26,615 --> 00:05:28,016
You live here?

69
00:05:28,052 --> 00:05:29,179
That's right.

70
00:05:29,222 --> 00:05:31,420
Decorate it yourself?

71
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,627
The decor is appropriate
for the period... 1964.

72
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,230
How did you pronounce
the name of this city?

73
00:05:37,272 --> 00:05:38,240
Kowloon.

74
00:05:38,274 --> 00:05:39,242
It's part of Hong Kong.

75
00:05:39,277 --> 00:05:41,042
And the nightclub was in Paris

76
00:05:41,081 --> 00:05:43,074
which, if I remember correctly

77
00:05:43,119 --> 00:05:45,818
was on the other side
of the planet.

78
00:05:49,299 --> 00:05:50,632
Mr. Bashir

79
00:05:50,668 --> 00:05:52,433
I didn't expect
you home so soon.

80
00:05:52,472 --> 00:05:55,411
I decided to leave Paris
a little early.

81
00:05:55,446 --> 00:05:57,849
Allow me to introduce
my friend, Mr. Garak.

82
00:05:57,885 --> 00:06:00,186
Garak, this is
my personal valet, Mona Luvsitt.

83
00:06:00,223 --> 00:06:02,056
Pleased to make
your acquaintance.

84
00:06:02,094 --> 00:06:05,124
Would you like to change
into something more comfortable?

85
00:06:05,168 --> 00:06:06,603
Oh, that would be perfect.

86
00:06:06,637 --> 00:06:09,974
Let's see if we can find
Mr. Garak something as well.

87
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:12,915
I'll see what I can do.

88
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:14,750
Would you like me
to put this away?

89
00:06:14,788 --> 00:06:16,121
Please.

90
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:19,498
Care for a drink?

91
00:06:19,532 --> 00:06:21,525
Not just yet.

92
00:06:26,647 --> 00:06:30,314
Is she your valet,
or your personal assassin?

93
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:31,322
Valet.

94
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:32,484
Mona's very capable.

95
00:06:32,527 --> 00:06:34,121
She speaks seven languages

96
00:06:34,164 --> 00:06:36,328
has degrees in biology,
chemistry, physics

97
00:06:36,402 --> 00:06:39,341
can fly anything
from a jet to a helicopter

98
00:06:39,376 --> 00:06:41,005
and makes an excellent martini.

99
00:06:41,046 --> 00:06:43,813
Cheers.

100
00:06:43,852 --> 00:06:46,653
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

101
00:06:46,691 --> 00:06:49,356
I'll let you know.

102
00:06:51,168 --> 00:06:53,138
I take it your character

103
00:06:53,172 --> 00:06:54,801
is some kind
of rich dilettante

104
00:06:54,843 --> 00:06:57,007
with a fascination
for women and weapons.

105
00:06:57,048 --> 00:07:00,783
Actually, my character
is far more disreputable.

106
00:07:00,822 --> 00:07:01,812
I'm a spy.

107
00:07:01,859 --> 00:07:03,328
A spy?

108
00:07:03,361 --> 00:07:04,887
And you live here?

109
00:07:04,931 --> 00:07:06,160
Yes.

110
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:07,636
I work for one
of the nation-states

111
00:07:07,672 --> 00:07:08,731
of this era, Great Britain

112
00:07:08,774 --> 00:07:11,678
which is battling
various other nations

113
00:07:11,713 --> 00:07:13,342
in what is called
the "Cold War."

114
00:07:13,383 --> 00:07:16,481
This apartment, my clothes,
weapons, even my valet

115
00:07:16,524 --> 00:07:18,323
were provided to me
by my government.

116
00:07:18,361 --> 00:07:22,632
I think I joined
the wrong intelligence service.

117
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,779
<i>Orinoco</i> to Deep Space 9.

118
00:07:28,818 --> 00:07:31,517
This is Captain Sisko
requesting landing clearance.

119
00:07:31,557 --> 00:07:32,752
Welcome back, Captain.

120
00:07:32,793 --> 00:07:35,264
You're cleared to set down
on Landing Pad 3.

121
00:07:35,299 --> 00:07:36,632
How was the conference?

122
00:07:36,668 --> 00:07:37,967
Informative, but I've got

123
00:07:38,004 --> 00:07:39,803
a ship full
of tired officers here.

124
00:07:39,842 --> 00:07:42,245
I think we'll all be happy
to be in our own beds tonight.

125
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,544
I can imagine.

126
00:07:43,584 --> 00:07:45,554
There's some message traffic
from Starfleet Command

127
00:07:45,588 --> 00:07:46,887
for you to look at,
but nothing...

128
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:50,523
Captain, there's some kind
of power surge in the warp core.

129
00:07:50,565 --> 00:07:53,366
Looks like a fluctuation
in the plasma coils.

130
00:07:53,405 --> 00:07:55,706
We'd better take
the warp core off line.

131
00:07:56,745 --> 00:07:57,713
I can't.

132
00:07:57,748 --> 00:07:58,943
There's something wrong

133
00:07:58,984 --> 00:08:00,283
with the command
control systems.

134
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,379
I'm completely locked out.

135
00:08:01,423 --> 00:08:02,687
Magnetic interlocks are failing.

136
00:08:02,726 --> 00:08:03,887
Warp core breach is imminent.

137
00:08:03,928 --> 00:08:06,058
Eject the warp core.

138
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,401
The ejection system
isn't responding.

139
00:08:08,471 --> 00:08:11,535
Correction.
The ejection system is missing.

140
00:08:11,578 --> 00:08:13,047
We've been sabotaged.

141
00:08:13,081 --> 00:08:14,710
Ten seconds to warp core breach.

142
00:08:14,752 --> 00:08:15,981
<i>Orinoco,</i>
cut your impulse engines

143
00:08:16,022 --> 00:08:17,012
and drop your deflectors.

144
00:08:17,057 --> 00:08:18,720
We're going to try
to beam you out of there.

145
00:08:18,761 --> 00:08:19,729
Acknowledged.

146
00:08:19,763 --> 00:08:20,753
Cut main power.

147
00:08:26,077 --> 00:08:29,812
I've locked on.
Energizing.

148
00:08:53,704 --> 00:08:54,672
What happened?

149
00:08:54,706 --> 00:08:55,731
Captain Sisko's runabout

150
00:08:55,775 --> 00:08:58,110
exploded while I was trying
to beam them back.

151
00:08:58,147 --> 00:08:59,514
Some of the energy traveled

152
00:08:59,551 --> 00:09:01,749
back along the transporter
beam and blew up

153
00:09:01,788 --> 00:09:02,949
the primary energizing coils.

154
00:09:02,991 --> 00:09:04,460
Do we still have their patterns?

155
00:09:04,495 --> 00:09:06,055
Yes, they're in the buffer.

156
00:09:06,098 --> 00:09:07,931
But the patterns
will start to degrade

157
00:09:07,969 --> 00:09:09,028
if not used immediately.

158
00:09:09,071 --> 00:09:10,973
We need to store
the patterns somewhere.

159
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,067
No, this is more complicated

160
00:09:12,111 --> 00:09:13,705
than just an ordinary
transporter pattern.

161
00:09:13,748 --> 00:09:16,049
We're going to have to preserve
all the neural signatures

162
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:17,282
of everyone on that runabout.

163
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,316
Do you know how much memory
it would take

164
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,333
to save just one person's neural
signature, much less five?

165
00:09:22,367 --> 00:09:23,768
I don't think
we have any choice.

166
00:09:23,804 --> 00:09:25,273
Computer,
I need to store all data

167
00:09:25,307 --> 00:09:27,243
currently in the transporter
pattern buffer.

168
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:29,009
Where can I save it?

169
00:09:29,048 --> 00:09:31,611
There is insufficient computer
memory to save the data.

170
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,353
Pattern buffer
is beginning to lose coherence.

171
00:09:34,393 --> 00:09:36,454
The patterns will start
to degrade any second now.

172
00:09:36,498 --> 00:09:39,299
Computer, what if we wiped all
computer memory in every system

173
00:09:39,337 --> 00:09:41,934
on the station, and then
stored the patterns?

174
00:09:41,977 --> 00:09:44,107
That procedure
has not been tested.

175
00:09:44,148 --> 00:09:45,549
It cannot be predicted.

176
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,885
The buffer is depolarizing.

177
00:09:47,923 --> 00:09:50,417
Computer, this is
a command priority override.

178
00:09:50,462 --> 00:09:52,261
Wipe all computer memory
necessary

179
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:54,827
in order to save the patterns
from the buffer.

180
00:09:54,872 --> 00:09:59,246
Authorization: Eddington-
zero-six-five-alpha enabled.

181
00:09:59,281 --> 00:10:01,650
Executing command override.

182
00:10:04,092 --> 00:10:05,721
Tricorder.

183
00:10:09,638 --> 00:10:11,608
The buffer's lost coherence.

184
00:10:11,642 --> 00:10:13,339
The patterns are gone.

185
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,044
Did the computer
save them in time?

186
00:10:16,085 --> 00:10:18,021
I think so,
but I'm not sure where.

187
00:10:20,895 --> 00:10:22,558
Thank you, my dear.

188
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:25,002
Yes, this should do nicely.

189
00:10:25,038 --> 00:10:28,443
Although I'm not too sure
about the collar.

190
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,538
It's perfect.

191
00:10:29,582 --> 00:10:30,572
Oh?

192
00:10:32,856 --> 00:10:35,020
I'll have these cleaned
right away.

193
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,359
Thank you.

194
00:10:36,396 --> 00:10:39,163
Isn't this a rather
ostentatious life for a spy?

195
00:10:39,202 --> 00:10:40,671
It's all part of my cover.

196
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:42,642
I'm posing
as a wealthy jet-setter

197
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:44,145
so I have to act like one.

198
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,341
Jet-setter?

199
00:10:45,383 --> 00:10:47,752
People of this era
used to travel in...

200
00:11:07,665 --> 00:11:09,932
Julian.

201
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,533
I must have fallen asleep.

202
00:11:12,576 --> 00:11:15,207
Very funny.

203
00:11:15,248 --> 00:11:18,152
Who else did you invite
along with you today?

204
00:11:18,188 --> 00:11:21,525
Well, this wasn't my idea.

205
00:11:21,562 --> 00:11:22,689
Major?

206
00:11:22,731 --> 00:11:24,633
Colonel, actually.

207
00:11:24,669 --> 00:11:28,610
Colonel Anastasia Komananov,
KGB.

208
00:11:28,644 --> 00:11:33,644
Oh, Julian, I never thought
I'd see you alive again.

209
00:11:33,688 --> 00:11:36,889
Not after you fell out
of that dirigible over Iceland.

210
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,228
I had a parachute

211
00:11:38,266 --> 00:11:41,136
and there was a submarine there
waiting for me.

212
00:11:41,171 --> 00:11:43,198
But how did you know about that?

213
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:46,216
Have you been downloading
my holosuite program?

214
00:11:46,249 --> 00:11:48,116
Oh, Julian, you are not well.

215
00:11:48,154 --> 00:11:49,453
Let's lie down.

216
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,959
I must say

217
00:11:50,993 --> 00:11:54,694
Major Kira's certainly throwing
herself into the role, Doctor.

218
00:11:54,735 --> 00:11:57,138
Nerys, please...

219
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:01,309
Who is this Major Nerys Kira?

220
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,685
Kira Nerys, actually.

221
00:12:03,721 --> 00:12:05,452
Perhaps...

222
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:07,827
this isn't Major Kira after all.

223
00:12:07,863 --> 00:12:10,562
I'm beginning
to think you're right.

224
00:12:10,603 --> 00:12:12,300
Computer, restore the image

225
00:12:12,341 --> 00:12:15,006
of Colonel Komananov back
to its original parameters.

226
00:12:15,046 --> 00:12:16,743
Unable to comply.

227
00:12:16,817 --> 00:12:20,052
The character parameters of
Colonel Komananov are correct.

228
00:12:20,091 --> 00:12:21,150
I'd say someone's

229
00:12:21,193 --> 00:12:23,186
been tampering
with your program, Doctor.

230
00:12:23,231 --> 00:12:25,429
Julian, we don't
have time for games.

231
00:12:25,469 --> 00:12:27,200
There is much to talk about.

232
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,208
Excuse me.

233
00:12:28,242 --> 00:12:29,939
Computer, freeze program.

234
00:12:29,979 --> 00:12:31,208
Unable to comply.

235
00:12:31,248 --> 00:12:33,218
Computer control
has been disrupted

236
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,052
due to station-wide emergency.

237
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,058
Emergency?

238
00:12:36,092 --> 00:12:37,789
Bashir to Ops.
What's going on?

239
00:12:37,863 --> 00:12:39,959
We've got our hands full
right now, Doctor. Stand by.

240
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:40,969
Odo, wait.

241
00:12:41,003 --> 00:12:42,802
Doctor, where are you
and do you have access

242
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,139
to a working computer console?

243
00:12:44,177 --> 00:12:45,612
I'm in Holosuite 3.

244
00:12:45,647 --> 00:12:48,084
The program's running, but it
won't comply with my commands.

245
00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:49,713
The program is still running?

246
00:12:49,756 --> 00:12:52,193
I demand to know
who you are talking to.

247
00:12:52,228 --> 00:12:54,529
Julian, tell me!

248
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,160
That sounded like Kira.

249
00:12:56,203 --> 00:12:57,604
Not exactly.

250
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,111
Someone has replaced
one of the characters

251
00:13:00,145 --> 00:13:01,876
with the image of Major Kira.

252
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:02,884
What's going on?

253
00:13:02,918 --> 00:13:04,547
Stay where you are, Doctor.

254
00:13:04,588 --> 00:13:06,455
Keep the program running
for now.

255
00:13:06,493 --> 00:13:08,156
We'll get right back to you.

256
00:13:08,197 --> 00:13:10,998
Julian, talk to me.

257
00:13:11,036 --> 00:13:13,599
Tell me what is happening.

258
00:13:13,641 --> 00:13:14,802
I'm not sure myself.

259
00:13:14,845 --> 00:13:16,212
Ops to Bashir.

260
00:13:16,247 --> 00:13:18,775
Doctor, whatever you do,
don't end that program.

261
00:13:18,819 --> 00:13:19,980
Why not?

262
00:13:20,022 --> 00:13:21,457
There's been
a transporter accident.

263
00:13:21,493 --> 00:13:22,826
We believe
the holosuite memory core

264
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:24,955
is holding
the transporter patterns

265
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,264
of five crew members.

266
00:13:26,302 --> 00:13:28,830
If you stop the program,
their patterns might be lost.

267
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:29,843
How could that happen?

268
00:13:29,878 --> 00:13:31,107
It's a long story

269
00:13:31,147 --> 00:13:33,014
but, at this moment,
the patterns

270
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,647
of Captain Sisko, Kira,
Worf, Dax and O'Brien

271
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,786
exist only
in the holosuite database.

272
00:13:37,828 --> 00:13:39,354
Don't leave the holosuite.

273
00:13:39,398 --> 00:13:42,302
If you do, it might disrupt
the holo-imaging array

274
00:13:42,338 --> 00:13:43,967
and right now,
we can't take any chances.

275
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:45,204
You'll have to stay in there

276
00:13:45,244 --> 00:13:46,770
and keep the program running
for now.

277
00:13:46,814 --> 00:13:49,217
Understood.

278
00:13:49,253 --> 00:13:50,854
We'll get back to you, Doctor.

279
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,364
Oh, Julian...

280
00:14:00,408 --> 00:14:02,435
you are so tense.

281
00:14:02,479 --> 00:14:04,415
It's been one of those days.

282
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:07,946
I wish I could relax you

283
00:14:07,991 --> 00:14:10,087
but I am here on business.

284
00:14:10,129 --> 00:14:11,462
In the last 24 hours

285
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:14,300
a series of earthquakes
have struck cities

286
00:14:14,338 --> 00:14:16,240
from Vladivostok to New York.

287
00:14:16,276 --> 00:14:19,909
Our seismologists
have analyzed the earthquakes

288
00:14:19,951 --> 00:14:23,516
and have come to the conclusion
that they are artificial.

289
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:25,826
So? That's not so difficult.

290
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:27,163
One only has to...

291
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:27,963
Garak.

292
00:14:30,507 --> 00:14:33,308
Your friend
seems to know something.

293
00:14:33,347 --> 00:14:36,809
Believe me, he knows nothing.

294
00:14:38,993 --> 00:14:41,521
If you say so.

295
00:14:41,565 --> 00:14:45,666
Because of the global nature
of this crisis

296
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:50,515
my government and yours
have decided to cooperate.

297
00:14:50,551 --> 00:14:52,954
We will be working...

298
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,223
very closely.

299
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:57,460
I'm sure we will.

300
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:03,468
Our assignment is to find out
who caused the earthquakes

301
00:15:03,513 --> 00:15:05,244
and what they want.

302
00:15:05,284 --> 00:15:07,277
A rather vague assignment.

303
00:15:07,321 --> 00:15:09,451
We do have one clue.

304
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:12,625
One of the world's
leading seismologists

305
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:16,004
Professor Honey Bare,
has vanished.

306
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:20,483
We believe...
she has been kidnapped.

307
00:15:25,863 --> 00:15:28,300
I didn't think
she was your type.

308
00:15:28,335 --> 00:15:30,271
You said she's been kidnapped?

309
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:31,638
We think so.

310
00:15:31,675 --> 00:15:33,702
She disappeared only a few hours

311
00:15:33,746 --> 00:15:36,582
before the first quake
struck New York City.

312
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,091
Doctor, we're in the middle
of an emergency.

313
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,756
Is this really the time
to be playing games?

314
00:15:41,864 --> 00:15:42,763
Look.

315
00:15:42,866 --> 00:15:43,959
Interesting.

316
00:15:45,505 --> 00:15:47,566
If Honey Bare
is killed, the computer

317
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,580
will erase her character
from its program.

318
00:15:49,614 --> 00:15:52,211
Now, since the program thinks
that Dax is Honey Bare...

319
00:15:52,253 --> 00:15:56,456
The computer would actually be
erasing Commander Dax's pattern.

320
00:15:56,496 --> 00:15:58,990
Kira... uh, Ana...

321
00:15:59,035 --> 00:16:03,944
do you have any idea
where Professor Bare is?

322
00:16:03,979 --> 00:16:06,450
She was last seen...

323
00:16:07,854 --> 00:16:09,187
I'll be right with you, Mona.

324
00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:26,220
Chief...

325
00:16:26,261 --> 00:16:27,787
No.

326
00:16:27,898 --> 00:16:29,994
It's Falcon.

327
00:16:30,037 --> 00:16:32,133
Nice to see you, Mr. Bashir.

328
00:16:32,174 --> 00:16:36,707
Now I think we have
a little unfinished business.

329
00:16:48,644 --> 00:16:50,842
Surprised to see me, Mr. Bashir?

330
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:52,316
You could say that.

331
00:16:52,352 --> 00:16:53,946
Well, you should use something

332
00:16:53,989 --> 00:16:56,392
a little more lethal
than a champagne cork.

333
00:16:56,428 --> 00:16:57,453
Something...

334
00:16:57,497 --> 00:16:58,590
like this.

335
00:16:58,633 --> 00:16:59,760
Wait.

336
00:17:01,138 --> 00:17:02,971
Wait, please.

337
00:17:03,009 --> 00:17:05,674
Let us have one last kiss.

338
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,380
Why not?

339
00:17:09,423 --> 00:17:13,626
I've always been
a romantic at heart.

340
00:17:19,979 --> 00:17:22,006
Earring.

341
00:17:32,574 --> 00:17:35,137
All right, Bashir,
that's enough.

342
00:17:51,148 --> 00:17:52,116
Interesting jewelry.

343
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:55,715
I bought those
for Anastasia last Christmas.

344
00:17:55,758 --> 00:17:57,819
You're bleeding.

345
00:17:57,863 --> 00:18:00,096
The holosuite safeties
must be off.

346
00:18:00,135 --> 00:18:01,468
Time to clip
this bird's wings.

347
00:18:01,504 --> 00:18:02,472
No!

348
00:18:02,506 --> 00:18:05,707
<i>Nyet!</i>
What are you doing?

349
00:18:05,746 --> 00:18:06,805
We can't kill him.

350
00:18:06,849 --> 00:18:08,182
Julian, what are you saying?

351
00:18:08,219 --> 00:18:10,383
He's been trying to kill you
for nine years.

352
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:13,021
I wouldn't dismiss her idea
so quickly, Doctor.

353
00:18:13,063 --> 00:18:14,088
But that's Miles.

354
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:16,534
No, as you pointed out,
he's Falcon...

355
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,403
a hired assassin
who's going to do

356
00:18:18,442 --> 00:18:19,911
everything he can to kill you

357
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:22,346
and without the holosuite
safeties in place

358
00:18:22,383 --> 00:18:23,476
he may just do that.

359
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,455
Well, what do you want me
to do... kill him?

360
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:28,155
I want you to stop
treating this like a game

361
00:18:28,196 --> 00:18:31,931
where everything's going to
turn out all right in the end.

362
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:34,441
Real spies
have to make hard choices.

363
00:18:34,477 --> 00:18:35,844
You want to save Dax?

364
00:18:35,879 --> 00:18:38,316
Fine, but you may not
have the luxury

365
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:39,376
of saving everyone.

366
00:18:39,421 --> 00:18:40,389
Who is Dax?

367
00:18:40,423 --> 00:18:43,590
Eventually, you may have
to let someone die.

368
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,327
I'll deal with that situation

369
00:18:45,367 --> 00:18:46,734
if and when it happens.

370
00:18:46,771 --> 00:18:48,969
In the meantime,
we have to find Dax.

371
00:18:49,042 --> 00:18:50,409
Who is Dax?

372
00:18:50,445 --> 00:18:53,212
Ana, I promise I'll
explain everything later.

373
00:18:53,251 --> 00:18:55,984
Now, you said Professor
Bare had been kidnapped.

374
00:18:56,091 --> 00:18:57,583
Do you have any suspects?

375
00:18:57,628 --> 00:19:00,601
We believe that Dr. Noah
is behind the abductions.

376
00:19:00,634 --> 00:19:03,869
During the last two years,
he has kidnapped

377
00:19:03,908 --> 00:19:06,539
an elite group
of 60 artisans and scientists

378
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,913
from around the world.

379
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,547
No one knows why
or where he has taken them

380
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:13,926
but our sources tell us
that each of the missing peoples

381
00:19:13,963 --> 00:19:16,764
was invited to meet Dr. Noah
at a club in Paris

382
00:19:16,802 --> 00:19:18,738
shortly before they disappeared.

383
00:19:18,774 --> 00:19:19,935
The Club Ingenue.

384
00:19:19,976 --> 00:19:21,171
<i>Da.</i>

385
00:19:21,213 --> 00:19:22,546
I had a feeling.

386
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,925
Sorry, my dear.

387
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,998
I hope you remember
how to tie a bow tie.

388
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:34,574
We're going to Paris.

389
00:19:37,348 --> 00:19:39,069
Who is Dax?!

390
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,335
I've had to make

391
00:19:42,376 --> 00:19:44,506
a few modifications to this
holosuite over the years.

392
00:19:44,548 --> 00:19:45,516
A few?

393
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,315
It's like a junkyard in here.

394
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:49,017
My brother won't let me
buy new components

395
00:19:49,057 --> 00:19:50,686
so I've had to scavenge
for what I need.

396
00:19:50,728 --> 00:19:52,698
I'm barely breaking even
on the holosuites as it is.

397
00:19:52,766 --> 00:19:55,203
If I had to buy new equipment
every time there was a glitch...

398
00:19:55,238 --> 00:19:57,573
Where's the core
memory interface?

399
00:19:57,609 --> 00:20:02,051
Oh... it's...
right behind the spatula.

400
00:20:02,086 --> 00:20:04,147
The spatula?

401
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:06,388
It's made of
a copper-ytterbium composite...

402
00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:08,160
the perfect plasma conductor.

403
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,074
I found them.

404
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:16,606
All five of their physical
patterns are in here...

405
00:20:16,651 --> 00:20:18,621
and they're stable.

406
00:20:18,656 --> 00:20:19,646
Why here?

407
00:20:19,692 --> 00:20:22,061
The holosuite
is specifically designed

408
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:24,295
to store
highly complex energy patterns.

409
00:20:24,335 --> 00:20:27,365
The computer's processing
their physical patterns

410
00:20:27,408 --> 00:20:29,504
as if they were
holosuite characters.

411
00:20:29,547 --> 00:20:31,745
The trouble is...

412
00:20:31,784 --> 00:20:34,449
I'm not reading
any neural energy.

413
00:20:34,491 --> 00:20:35,652
Neural energy

414
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,185
has to be stored
at the quantum level.

415
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,961
The holosuite can't handle that.

416
00:20:39,001 --> 00:20:41,802
So, if their physical bodies
are stored here

417
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,969
where are their brain patterns?

418
00:20:44,012 --> 00:20:46,985
Everywhere else.

419
00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:48,921
Their brain patterns
are so large

420
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:49,924
that they're taking up

421
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,723
every bit of computer memory
on the station...

422
00:20:51,762 --> 00:20:55,828
replicator memory,
weapons, life supports.

423
00:20:55,937 --> 00:20:57,770
He may be right.

424
00:20:57,809 --> 00:21:00,372
So what do we do about it?

425
00:21:00,415 --> 00:21:02,852
How do we get them back?

426
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,597
Uh, I'd like to see Dr. Noah.

427
00:21:25,636 --> 00:21:27,037
I have an invitation.

428
00:22:00,847 --> 00:22:02,840
May I see your invitation?

429
00:22:02,885 --> 00:22:04,354
Dr. Noah?

430
00:22:04,388 --> 00:22:05,652
I am Duchamps.

431
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:08,858
I am Dr. Noah's... associate.

432
00:22:08,932 --> 00:22:10,868
May I?

433
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:15,811
My name's Merriweather...

434
00:22:15,846 --> 00:22:19,377
Patrick Merriweather,
and this is my wife

435
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:23,920
Anastasia,
and my friend, Mr. Garak.

436
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,236
Charmed.

437
00:22:31,214 --> 00:22:33,583
Your invitation,
Mr. Merriweather.

438
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:35,920
I... don't have one.

439
00:22:35,991 --> 00:22:41,333
Dr. Noah does not like
unexpected guests.

440
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:44,400
Oh, I believe Dr. Noah
would be very interested

441
00:22:44,442 --> 00:22:45,877
in meeting my husband.

442
00:22:45,912 --> 00:22:50,183
He's one of the leading
geologists in the world.

443
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:55,956
Now, why would that
interest Dr. Noah?

444
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:57,470
Oh, we believe he's taken

445
00:22:57,505 --> 00:22:59,441
quite an interest
in the sciences.

446
00:22:59,475 --> 00:23:01,536
After all, he has
invited several

447
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:05,521
of the world's top scientists
to this... club.

448
00:23:05,556 --> 00:23:07,150
Isn't that true?

449
00:23:07,193 --> 00:23:09,824
I must say,
I feel a little insulted

450
00:23:09,865 --> 00:23:12,769
by being left out
of such an illustrious group.

451
00:23:12,805 --> 00:23:14,775
How unfortunate.

452
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,304
Of course...

453
00:23:17,349 --> 00:23:19,946
a meeting still can be arranged

454
00:23:19,987 --> 00:23:21,320
for a price.

455
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,451
Oh?

456
00:23:22,493 --> 00:23:24,760
Five million francs.

457
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:32,278
No problem.

458
00:23:34,954 --> 00:23:36,287
I do not understand.

459
00:23:36,324 --> 00:23:38,454
Where's the rest
of your money?

460
00:23:38,495 --> 00:23:40,488
Right in front of you.

461
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:45,373
Shall we begin?

462
00:23:45,443 --> 00:23:47,413
A Cardassian separatist group

463
00:23:47,448 --> 00:23:49,384
calling themselves
"The True Way"

464
00:23:49,419 --> 00:23:52,551
has claimed responsibility
for sabotaging the runabout.

465
00:23:52,592 --> 00:23:54,027
Ever heard of them before?

466
00:23:54,062 --> 00:23:56,465
Mmm. They're opposed
to the peace treaty.

467
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:59,838
They blame the Federation
for Cardassia's economic

468
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:01,640
and political troubles,
et cetera, et cetera.

469
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,675
Until now, they've never
committed any terrorist actions

470
00:24:04,719 --> 00:24:06,086
to support their beliefs.

471
00:24:06,122 --> 00:24:07,215
What have you found?

472
00:24:07,258 --> 00:24:11,461
From what we can tell,
Quark was right.

473
00:24:11,501 --> 00:24:14,166
The computer has stored
the neural energy patterns

474
00:24:14,207 --> 00:24:17,008
of everyone on the runabout
throughout the entire station.

475
00:24:17,046 --> 00:24:18,743
Don't everyone thank me at once.

476
00:24:18,783 --> 00:24:19,751
What we need to do

477
00:24:19,786 --> 00:24:21,346
is reintegrate
their neural patterns

478
00:24:21,389 --> 00:24:23,587
with their physical patterns
from the holosuite

479
00:24:23,627 --> 00:24:25,028
and rematerialize them.

480
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:26,590
I say we use the <i>Defiant.</i>

481
00:24:26,634 --> 00:24:29,937
Its power systems and computers
are independent of the station

482
00:24:29,975 --> 00:24:31,877
and it has its own transporter.

483
00:24:31,912 --> 00:24:34,908
Sounds good, except...

484
00:24:34,952 --> 00:24:36,011
Except what?

485
00:24:36,054 --> 00:24:38,218
Well, my equipment
isn't designed

486
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,561
to interface
with Starfleet systems.

487
00:24:40,598 --> 00:24:43,069
I may have to make
some modifications.

488
00:25:07,524 --> 00:25:09,426
Card.

489
00:25:18,381 --> 00:25:20,044
Nine.

490
00:25:23,092 --> 00:25:25,028
Five million francs.

491
00:25:27,301 --> 00:25:30,000
You're quite a baccarat player,
Mr. Merriweather.

492
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,070
Baccarat and geology
are my life.

493
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:34,309
Now then

494
00:25:34,349 --> 00:25:37,322
Mr. Duchamps, I believe
I've met your conditions.

495
00:25:40,195 --> 00:25:41,824
When do we leave?

496
00:25:44,304 --> 00:25:46,171
Right now.

497
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:20,107
Another decorator's nightmare.

498
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:24,148
This era had
a distinct lack of taste.

499
00:26:24,192 --> 00:26:25,923
Where are we?

500
00:26:25,963 --> 00:26:29,596
Welcome to paradise,
Mr. Merriweather.

501
00:26:29,637 --> 00:26:32,131
I believe you've
been looking for me.

502
00:26:32,176 --> 00:26:36,881
My name is Hippocrates Noah.

503
00:26:44,637 --> 00:26:47,040
Mr. Merriweather...

504
00:26:47,075 --> 00:26:49,808
I understand
your field is geology.

505
00:26:49,849 --> 00:26:51,910
That's right.

506
00:26:51,953 --> 00:26:54,390
Then I am sure
you can appreciate

507
00:26:54,425 --> 00:26:57,329
the stones in my most
recent acquisition.

508
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,632
A most striking display...

509
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:02,198
of rubies...
tourmaline...

510
00:27:02,242 --> 00:27:05,306
sapphire... topaz...

511
00:27:05,349 --> 00:27:08,185
and judging by the high chromium
content of the rubies,

512
00:27:08,223 --> 00:27:10,387
I'd say they come from

513
00:27:10,427 --> 00:27:13,400
the hydrothermal deposits
on the Tibetan plateau...

514
00:27:13,434 --> 00:27:16,965
which isn't surprising

515
00:27:17,008 --> 00:27:20,209
considering we're
on the southeastern slope

516
00:27:20,315 --> 00:27:24,985
of Mt. Everest at about...
22,000 feet, I should say.

517
00:27:25,026 --> 00:27:27,520
25, actually.

518
00:27:27,565 --> 00:27:30,629
You must not get many tourists.

519
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:39,050
My guests and I
place a premium on our privacy.

520
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,151
We don't want
any unwelcomed guests

521
00:27:41,194 --> 00:27:44,725
such as men sent by governments

522
00:27:44,769 --> 00:27:47,742
who disagree
with my political philosophy.

523
00:27:47,776 --> 00:27:50,270
And what is your philosophy?

524
00:27:50,348 --> 00:27:53,047
Are you some kind of anarchist?

525
00:27:53,087 --> 00:27:54,681
Quite the opposite.

526
00:27:54,724 --> 00:27:58,995
I believe in an orderly world...

527
00:27:59,033 --> 00:28:02,906
a far cry from the chaos
we find ourselves in today.

528
00:28:02,942 --> 00:28:06,541
We are building
a new future here.

529
00:28:06,583 --> 00:28:09,886
A new beginning for mankind.

530
00:28:09,924 --> 00:28:13,261
A new chapter in human history

531
00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:15,827
will open right here
on my island.

532
00:28:15,871 --> 00:28:17,465
Island?

533
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,976
Forgive me.

534
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,685
Sometimes I do
get ahead of myself.

535
00:28:25,725 --> 00:28:28,768
Allow me to explain.

536
00:28:36,017 --> 00:28:37,509
We're almost ready.

537
00:28:37,554 --> 00:28:39,787
I've programmed
the laser sequence

538
00:28:39,825 --> 00:28:41,419
and I'm making
some last-minute adjustments

539
00:28:41,462 --> 00:28:43,125
to a South American site.

540
00:28:43,166 --> 00:28:46,264
I do have every confidence
in you, my dear.

541
00:28:46,306 --> 00:28:48,470
She's working with him.

542
00:28:48,511 --> 00:28:50,744
You see, Mr. Merriweather

543
00:28:50,782 --> 00:28:53,151
not only do I intend
to create a new future

544
00:28:53,188 --> 00:28:56,024
I intend to create a new world.

545
00:28:56,061 --> 00:28:57,997
At each one of these points

546
00:28:58,032 --> 00:28:59,729
I have hidden
a new form of laser...

547
00:28:59,769 --> 00:29:03,004
one that can penetrate
the Earth's crust

548
00:29:03,043 --> 00:29:04,876
down into the mantle itself.

549
00:29:04,913 --> 00:29:07,714
The global earthquakes.

550
00:29:07,754 --> 00:29:09,724
Those were only tests.

551
00:29:09,758 --> 00:29:13,254
Soon, I will activate
all of these lasers together

552
00:29:13,298 --> 00:29:17,033
and when I do, they will produce

553
00:29:17,074 --> 00:29:20,172
worldwide earthquakes
the likes of which

554
00:29:20,281 --> 00:29:21,807
we have never felt before.

555
00:29:21,851 --> 00:29:24,049
Killing everyone on the planet.

556
00:29:24,089 --> 00:29:26,025
More than that.

557
00:29:26,061 --> 00:29:31,506
There comes a time
when a house has been so damaged

558
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:33,669
by termites that you must

559
00:29:33,711 --> 00:29:37,709
not only kill the termites,
but demolish the house

560
00:29:37,753 --> 00:29:39,849
and build again.

561
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:45,027
The quakes are only
a minor side effect.

562
00:29:45,069 --> 00:29:47,404
The real goal of this project

563
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,609
is to have these lasers of mine

564
00:29:51,649 --> 00:29:55,681
produce massive fissures
in the Earth's crust

565
00:29:55,725 --> 00:29:58,960
releasing millions of tons
of molten lava.

566
00:30:01,571 --> 00:30:06,913
Now, Mr. Merriweather,
you're the geologist.

567
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:10,914
Tell me, what happens next?

568
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:14,091
Once that much lava is released

569
00:30:14,132 --> 00:30:17,162
the tectonic plates
would begin to settle.

570
00:30:17,206 --> 00:30:20,611
And the surface of the planet
will shrink

571
00:30:20,647 --> 00:30:24,314
just like letting air
out of a balloon.

572
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:28,490
But if the surface
of the Earth shrinks

573
00:30:28,531 --> 00:30:30,627
the oceans...

574
00:30:30,669 --> 00:30:33,334
Will cover the Earth.

575
00:30:33,408 --> 00:30:35,173
Diabolical.

576
00:30:35,213 --> 00:30:38,209
Visionary.

577
00:30:38,252 --> 00:30:43,628
I am going to let
mankind begin anew...

578
00:30:43,664 --> 00:30:48,664
here... on this island paradise.

579
00:30:48,709 --> 00:30:52,240
The only place
that will remain above water

580
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:55,187
on my brave new world.

581
00:30:55,223 --> 00:30:58,059
And that is why I have gathered

582
00:30:58,096 --> 00:31:03,335
the finest minds, the very best
that mankind has to offer.

583
00:31:03,374 --> 00:31:07,679
We will repopulate and
start a new human race.

584
00:31:07,717 --> 00:31:10,781
Pity you won't be able
to join us.

585
00:31:10,823 --> 00:31:13,351
Are you revoking my invitation?

586
00:31:13,396 --> 00:31:19,273
Oh, I intend to do more
than that... Mr. Bashir.

587
00:31:21,347 --> 00:31:25,755
Not only have I brought
the greatest minds

588
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,384
to my mountain retreat

589
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:31,902
but I have also hired
the greatest protection

590
00:31:31,937 --> 00:31:35,708
that money can buy.

591
00:31:39,554 --> 00:31:43,586
I believe you already know
my newest employee.

592
00:31:50,811 --> 00:31:52,781
Is all this really necessary?

593
00:31:52,816 --> 00:31:54,445
It's the best I can do.

594
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:58,055
How long until we're ready

595
00:31:58,094 --> 00:31:59,723
to try retrieving
their patterns?

596
00:31:59,765 --> 00:32:01,998
I'd say... another hour.

597
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,434
O'Brien's going to kill me
when he gets back.

598
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:19,436
This is one of 74 lasers

599
00:32:19,508 --> 00:32:21,307
that I've deployed
around the world.

600
00:32:21,345 --> 00:32:23,247
When I throw that switch

601
00:32:23,283 --> 00:32:25,846
it will begin
a five-minute countdown

602
00:32:25,888 --> 00:32:27,448
that even I can't stop.

603
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:30,930
And once the laser fires,
the whole cave

604
00:32:30,966 --> 00:32:33,301
will be filled
with molten lava.

605
00:32:33,338 --> 00:32:35,969
Where's Colonel Komananov?

606
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:37,912
She's a spirited individual...

607
00:32:37,949 --> 00:32:38,917
young...

608
00:32:38,951 --> 00:32:40,648
healthy.

609
00:32:40,688 --> 00:32:42,157
We'll need women like her

610
00:32:42,191 --> 00:32:44,788
to help propagate
the second human race.

611
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:52,840
Try to stay cool, Mr. Bashir.

612
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,749
So what do we do now?

613
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:12,090
I'm thinking.

614
00:33:12,127 --> 00:33:13,892
Think faster.

615
00:33:13,931 --> 00:33:17,462
I don't know if I've made this
explicit to you or not, Doctor

616
00:33:17,505 --> 00:33:22,175
but I really don't want to die
chained to a 20th-century laser.

617
00:33:22,216 --> 00:33:24,813
I think it's time to end
this program.

618
00:33:24,855 --> 00:33:26,188
We can't do that.

619
00:33:26,225 --> 00:33:29,528
We'd wipe out the patterns
of Sisko and the others.

620
00:33:29,566 --> 00:33:32,265
Then may I suggest calling
Commander Eddington

621
00:33:32,305 --> 00:33:34,366
and having him
send someone in here

622
00:33:34,409 --> 00:33:35,969
to remove these handcuffs?

623
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:38,382
You heard what Odo said...
we don't know what'll happen

624
00:33:38,418 --> 00:33:40,012
if we interrupt
the holo-imaging array

625
00:33:40,088 --> 00:33:41,215
by calling for the doors.

626
00:33:41,258 --> 00:33:43,627
The entire program might
collapse and kill them all.

627
00:33:43,663 --> 00:33:46,226
Well, I only know
one thing for sure, Doctor

628
00:33:46,269 --> 00:33:50,210
that when the molten lava
begins pouring into this cave

629
00:33:50,244 --> 00:33:53,479
you and I are going to be
very uncomfortable.

630
00:33:55,389 --> 00:33:56,379
Who's that?

631
00:33:57,593 --> 00:33:59,153
It's our ticket out of here.

632
00:34:02,271 --> 00:34:05,107
What a waste...

633
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:08,548
that no one can see
what a beautiful woman you are.

634
00:34:08,584 --> 00:34:10,019
Is that your plan?

635
00:34:10,121 --> 00:34:12,718
Shut up.

636
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,427
Noah only wants you
for your mind.

637
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:20,467
He can't appreciate
the woman inside you.

638
00:34:20,511 --> 00:34:24,042
Honey, would you grant me

639
00:34:24,085 --> 00:34:28,994
one last request...
and take off those glasses?

640
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,499
Oh...

641
00:34:40,555 --> 00:34:41,922
Like this?

642
00:34:41,957 --> 00:34:43,756
Yes.

643
00:34:51,712 --> 00:34:53,011
You know

644
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:57,013
your hair would look
so much better

645
00:34:57,057 --> 00:34:58,356
if it were free.

646
00:34:58,394 --> 00:34:59,487
I must say, Doctor

647
00:34:59,529 --> 00:35:01,932
this is more than I
ever wanted to know

648
00:35:01,968 --> 00:35:03,699
about your fantasy life.

649
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,991
There...

650
00:35:16,032 --> 00:35:21,568
that's the last thing
I want to remember

651
00:35:21,612 --> 00:35:23,605
before I die.

652
00:35:25,153 --> 00:35:26,816
Thank you.

653
00:35:41,355 --> 00:35:44,624
I'd give you both
some privacy if I could.

654
00:35:54,417 --> 00:35:55,886
Great plan.

655
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,118
Now can we call Eddington?

656
00:35:59,862 --> 00:36:02,527
That will not be necessary.

657
00:36:02,568 --> 00:36:05,973
Honey has given me
all we need.

658
00:36:06,009 --> 00:36:07,842
Hmm... kiss the girl,
get the key.

659
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:10,214
They never taught me that
in the Obsidian Order.

660
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:14,189
Come on!

661
00:36:33,236 --> 00:36:35,297
We have to get
to the control room.

662
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,604
What?!

663
00:36:36,643 --> 00:36:39,012
If this program ends
like the others

664
00:36:39,049 --> 00:36:42,820
either Komananov or Honey Bare
will be killed by Dr. Noah.

665
00:36:42,856 --> 00:36:44,485
The other's supposed
to end up with me.

666
00:36:44,527 --> 00:36:47,397
In either case

667
00:36:47,434 --> 00:36:49,131
we have to make sure
that both of them survive.

668
00:36:49,171 --> 00:36:50,970
You expect to take on Noah
and his men with that?

669
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:53,138
It's my fantasy.

670
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,375
Trust me.

671
00:36:54,415 --> 00:36:56,146
No!

672
00:36:56,186 --> 00:36:58,623
This has gone far enough.

673
00:36:58,658 --> 00:37:00,252
It's time to cut our losses.

674
00:37:00,362 --> 00:37:01,455
We can't do that.

675
00:37:01,498 --> 00:37:02,727
Kira or Dax might...

676
00:37:02,767 --> 00:37:05,204
Yes, they might be killed,
and that is unfortunate

677
00:37:05,272 --> 00:37:07,971
but there comes a time
when the odds are against you

678
00:37:08,011 --> 00:37:11,007
and the only reasonable
course of action is to quit.

679
00:37:11,052 --> 00:37:12,020
Quit?

680
00:37:12,054 --> 00:37:13,147
Yes!

681
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:16,026
Is that what they taught you
at the Obsidian Order?

682
00:37:16,063 --> 00:37:17,498
To give up
when things get tough?

683
00:37:17,533 --> 00:37:18,832
As a matter of fact, they did.

684
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:20,839
That's why I've managed
to stay alive

685
00:37:20,874 --> 00:37:22,810
while most of my colleagues
are dead

686
00:37:22,844 --> 00:37:25,247
because I know
when to walk away

687
00:37:25,316 --> 00:37:27,252
and that time is now.
Now!

688
00:37:27,321 --> 00:37:29,451
And you'd know that,
Doctor, if you were

689
00:37:29,492 --> 00:37:30,859
a real intelligence agent.

690
00:37:30,896 --> 00:37:33,390
Oh, so that's
what this is all about.

691
00:37:33,435 --> 00:37:35,668
The fact that my fantasy
happens to step

692
00:37:35,706 --> 00:37:38,007
on what you consider to be
your private domain.

693
00:37:38,044 --> 00:37:39,479
Well, what's the matter, Garak?

694
00:37:39,514 --> 00:37:41,849
Have I bruised your ego
by playacting at something

695
00:37:41,886 --> 00:37:43,788
you take so very seriously?

696
00:37:43,824 --> 00:37:45,760
That's something else
you've yet to learn, Doctor.

697
00:37:45,795 --> 00:37:49,827
A real intelligence agent
has no ego, no conscience,

698
00:37:49,871 --> 00:37:53,972
no remorse... only a sense
of professionalism

699
00:37:54,013 --> 00:37:57,248
and mine is telling me
that it's time to go.

700
00:37:57,286 --> 00:37:58,254
Computer!

701
00:37:58,289 --> 00:37:59,279
Don't!

702
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,289
Or what?

703
00:38:02,332 --> 00:38:04,234
You'll kill me?

704
00:38:04,269 --> 00:38:06,262
If you call for the exit

705
00:38:06,306 --> 00:38:09,473
you might kill Sisko
and the others

706
00:38:09,514 --> 00:38:11,815
and I am not prepared
to risk that.

707
00:38:11,852 --> 00:38:15,485
I'm afraid I don't believe
you'll pull that trigger.

708
00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:17,463
I wouldn't be so sure
about that.

709
00:38:17,498 --> 00:38:20,494
It's time
to face reality, Doctor.

710
00:38:20,538 --> 00:38:23,909
You're a man
who dreams of being a hero

711
00:38:23,945 --> 00:38:27,886
because you know, deep down,
that you're not.

712
00:38:27,921 --> 00:38:30,222
I'm no hero either

713
00:38:30,259 --> 00:38:34,098
but I do know
how to make a choice

714
00:38:34,135 --> 00:38:38,270
and I'm choosing to save myself.

715
00:38:39,914 --> 00:38:40,882
Computer

716
00:38:40,916 --> 00:38:42,283
show me the mechanism...

717
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:43,480
Oh!

718
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,537
You'll be fine.

719
00:38:53,577 --> 00:38:55,513
It's just a flesh wound.

720
00:38:55,548 --> 00:38:57,678
That was awfully close.

721
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,624
What if you'd killed me?

722
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:02,960
What makes you think
I wasn't trying?

723
00:39:02,998 --> 00:39:08,340
Doctor, I do believe
there's hope for you yet.

724
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:10,073
I'm so relieved.

725
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:12,585
Now we have to get
to the control room.

726
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:14,054
Are you coming or not?

727
00:39:14,089 --> 00:39:20,593
Well, who am I to question
Julian Bashir, secret agent?

728
00:39:20,636 --> 00:39:23,039
Lead on.

729
00:39:23,142 --> 00:39:24,805
Everybody stay where you are.

730
00:39:24,845 --> 00:39:25,835
Julian.

731
00:39:25,882 --> 00:39:27,181
Your weapon, Dr. Noah.

732
00:39:27,217 --> 00:39:29,381
This is your doing.

733
00:39:29,456 --> 00:39:31,323
You let them go.

734
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,387
I'm sorry, Doctor.

735
00:39:33,498 --> 00:39:34,625
Julian, you are just in time.

736
00:39:34,667 --> 00:39:36,000
He was about to activate

737
00:39:36,037 --> 00:39:37,870
the final sequence
of the lasers.

738
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:39,537
Kill him, Julian.

739
00:39:39,578 --> 00:39:40,979
Not this time, Ana.

740
00:39:41,015 --> 00:39:42,074
Well, then I will.

741
00:39:42,117 --> 00:39:43,085
No!

742
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,280
What are you doing?

743
00:39:44,322 --> 00:39:46,418
Making a mistake.

744
00:39:46,493 --> 00:39:49,898
Thank you, Mr. Duchamps.

745
00:39:49,934 --> 00:39:51,198
Eddington to Bashir.

746
00:39:51,237 --> 00:39:52,432
We're going to try

747
00:39:52,507 --> 00:39:54,774
rematerializing their patterns
in about two minutes.

748
00:39:54,811 --> 00:39:55,801
Understood.

749
00:39:57,317 --> 00:40:00,813
And what is it you understand,
Mr. Bashir?

750
00:40:00,859 --> 00:40:04,458
That you should have killed me
when you had the chance?

751
00:40:04,533 --> 00:40:06,560
I agree.

752
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:11,980
But, then again, I suppose
it wouldn't be very... heroic.

753
00:40:12,016 --> 00:40:14,920
I, on the other hand

754
00:40:14,955 --> 00:40:20,491
have no pretensions
about the idea of being a hero.

755
00:40:20,601 --> 00:40:22,332
Wait!

756
00:40:24,075 --> 00:40:26,672
Maybe I'm tired of being a hero.

757
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:29,916
Maybe I've thought over
what you've said

758
00:40:29,955 --> 00:40:32,647
and decided
that you're absolutely right.

759
00:40:32,781 --> 00:40:33,749
About what?

760
00:40:33,783 --> 00:40:35,377
Everything... the decadence

761
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,413
of the world,
the need for order.

762
00:40:37,458 --> 00:40:40,021
The more I think about it,
the more I realize

763
00:40:40,064 --> 00:40:43,595
that your way
may be the only way.

764
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:46,232
Ha!

765
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:57,561
You expect me to believe that?

766
00:40:59,573 --> 00:41:02,272
You are Julian Bashir

767
00:41:02,312 --> 00:41:05,979
a man who has spent
his entire life

768
00:41:06,021 --> 00:41:08,014
dedicated to fighting against...

769
00:41:08,058 --> 00:41:09,185
Yes!

770
00:41:09,228 --> 00:41:11,756
But that's all about to end now,
isn't it?

771
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,328
You're going to destroy
this world and start a new one.

772
00:41:14,373 --> 00:41:18,178
What's the use of me continuing
to defend a doomed planet?

773
00:41:18,214 --> 00:41:20,344
Can you see the sense in that?

774
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:24,818
- No.
- No.

775
00:41:24,862 --> 00:41:26,855
I'm an intelligence agent

776
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,736
and if there's
any one thing I've learned

777
00:41:29,773 --> 00:41:33,178
it is that there comes a point
when the odds are against you

778
00:41:33,213 --> 00:41:36,414
and there is no reasonable
course of action but to quit.

779
00:41:36,454 --> 00:41:39,586
How do you think I've managed
to stay alive so long

780
00:41:39,628 --> 00:41:41,826
when all of my compatriots
are dead?

781
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:45,362
It is because I have known
when to walk away.

782
00:41:52,155 --> 00:41:54,991
Rom to Ops.
I'm ready.

783
00:41:55,061 --> 00:41:57,965
You can start transferring the
neural energy to the <i>Defiant.</i>

784
00:41:58,002 --> 00:41:58,970
Acknowledged.

785
00:41:59,004 --> 00:42:01,100
Beginning data transfer.

786
00:42:03,413 --> 00:42:06,818
You make a very interesting
argument, Mr. Bashir.

787
00:42:06,855 --> 00:42:10,556
But I'm afraid I've been
looking forward to killing you

788
00:42:10,596 --> 00:42:12,760
for a long time.

789
00:42:12,801 --> 00:42:14,634
You need to move beyond that.

790
00:42:14,672 --> 00:42:19,171
You need to start thinking
about your new world order.

791
00:42:19,214 --> 00:42:22,551
You may even need
someone like me.

792
00:42:22,588 --> 00:42:25,720
If you think
that by going over there

793
00:42:25,762 --> 00:42:29,429
you are going to destroy
my control console

794
00:42:29,471 --> 00:42:31,999
you are wasting your time.

795
00:42:36,386 --> 00:42:40,259
I don't intend
to destroy your console, Doctor.

796
00:42:40,295 --> 00:42:42,630
I intend to use it.

797
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:46,100
You've just activated
the final laser sequence.

798
00:42:47,643 --> 00:42:50,080
You've destroyed the world.

799
00:42:53,724 --> 00:42:55,421
Data transfer complete.

800
00:42:55,461 --> 00:42:57,625
I am reestablishing
computer control

801
00:42:57,665 --> 00:42:58,758
over the station.

802
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,681
It's working
just as you planned.

803
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:08,154
You've done it, Doctor.

804
00:43:08,189 --> 00:43:09,522
Yes.

805
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:15,698
But somehow,
I didn't expect to win.

806
00:43:15,739 --> 00:43:18,040
I suppose

807
00:43:18,077 --> 00:43:23,316
the only thing left to do now
is to kill you.

808
00:43:33,144 --> 00:43:34,875
What happened, Commander?

809
00:43:34,914 --> 00:43:36,474
What did you do to my ship?

810
00:43:36,518 --> 00:43:39,319
It's going to take
some explaining.

811
00:43:39,357 --> 00:43:40,883
Eddington to Bashir.

812
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:42,726
We've got them, Doctor.

813
00:43:42,765 --> 00:43:44,667
You can leave the holosuite now.

814
00:43:44,703 --> 00:43:46,036
Thank you.

815
00:43:46,073 --> 00:43:47,736
Interesting.

816
00:43:47,776 --> 00:43:50,680
You saved the day
by destroying the world.

817
00:43:50,716 --> 00:43:53,917
I bet they didn't teach you that
at the Obsidian Order.

818
00:43:53,956 --> 00:43:58,125
No, no, there was a great deal
they didn't teach me.

819
00:43:58,199 --> 00:44:01,400
Like the value
of a good game of chance

820
00:44:01,439 --> 00:44:09,116
or how indulging in fantasy
keeps the mind creative.

821
00:44:10,793 --> 00:44:12,092
Lunch tomorrow?

822
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:13,463
Of course.

823
00:44:13,499 --> 00:44:16,300
But why don't we
have it at your place...

824
00:44:16,339 --> 00:44:18,206
in Hong Kong.

825
00:44:18,243 --> 00:44:21,808
Unless, of course,
this was your last mission.

826
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:24,549
Oh, I think it's safe to say

827
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:29,123
that Julian Bashir,
secret agent, will return.

828
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:30,360
Hmm...
