1
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:07,758
<i>Chief Medical Officer's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 52645.7.</i>

2
00:00:07,758 --> 00:00:11,846
<i>Colonel Kira, Garak and Odo</i>
<i>have returned to the station.</i>

3
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:14,389
<i>Despite my best efforts,</i>
<i>I have yet to make any progress</i>

4
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:16,600
<i>toward finding a cure</i>
<i>for Odo's disease.</i>

5
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:20,980
How long do I have?

6
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:24,065
I can't be sure.

7
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:27,235
You can make an educated guess.

8
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:30,280
I could, but first, I'd like
to talk about slowing down

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,783
the progress of the disease
with a series

10
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:34,075
of nadion bursts.

11
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:37,245
I want a time frame, Doctor.

12
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,290
A week... maybe two

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,376
with the
nadion therapy.

14
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,461
Thank you.

15
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,755
Now I want to see Kira.

16
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:50,342
Let me emphasize, Odo,
that I haven't given up hope

17
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:51,552
and it's very important

18
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:52,887
that you don't
give up, either.

19
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:54,179
Understood.

20
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:58,141
Now, please...
let me see Kira.

21
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,543
How do you feel?

22
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,336
Better.

23
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:31,926
This contraption of Julian's
seems to alleviate the pain.

24
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:33,218
Good.

25
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:37,848
You should be going soon.

26
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:40,183
I'm not going anywhere.

27
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,978
Damar and Garak can lead
the rebellion without me.

28
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:46,189
Damar needs someone

29
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:49,985
who's actually fought
with a resistance movement.

30
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:52,071
That's you, not Garak.

31
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:57,076
I am not leaving
until I know that you're...

32
00:01:57,076 --> 00:02:00,662
I want... you... to leave.

33
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,539
Why?

34
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:10,923
You... watched Bareil die

35
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:12,758
in this very room.

36
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:16,095
I know how that's
haunted you.

37
00:02:16,095 --> 00:02:19,389
I don't want
your last memory of me

38
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:23,978
to be witnessing my death.

39
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,567
Isn't that my choice?

40
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:34,029
Maybe it is...

41
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:37,908
and maybe I'm being selfish

42
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:42,121
telling you
all the things<i> I</i> want

43
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:49,128
but I don't want...
the last thing I see...

44
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:53,256
to be... pain in your eyes.

45
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:59,304
You'd be surprised how well
I can hide my feelings...

46
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,347
when I need to.

47
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,474
Not from me.

48
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:07,354
You<i> have</i> to go, Nerys.

49
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:14,528
(<i> softly</i> ):
All right.

50
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,160
Uh...

51
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,622
I-I can't be
a very pleasant sight.

52
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:30,585
I don't care how you look.

53
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,430
I've got so much to say, I...

54
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,807
I don't know where to begin.

55
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,435
Just say you love me.

56
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,646
That's all
I've ever cared about.

57
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:55,652
I love you, Odo.

58
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:59,364
I love you, Nerys.

59
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,825
O'BRIEN:
After I finished the tests

60
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,326
I forwarded the schematics

61
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,829
of the Breen weapon
to Starfleet Engineering.

62
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,414
They should have
a preliminary repor...

63
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,167
Garak and I should
be getting underway.

64
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,626
The Commander
is correct.

65
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,046
We have to evade several
Jem'Hadar patrols

66
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:16,090
in order to reach
Damar's base.

67
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,216
If we wait too long

68
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:19,176
they may alter
their patrol routes.

69
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:23,180
Chief... is there anything else
before they go?

70
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,933
No, sir. I think we have
all the data we need.

71
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,435
Well, then.

72
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,104
Good hunting to you both.

73
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,481
Thank you, sir.

74
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,319
Julian...

75
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,738
I'll do
everything I can.

76
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,662
Doctor?

77
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,831
Is there anything
I can do to help?

78
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,625
Any additional resources
you might want

79
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,834
from Starfleet Medical?

80
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,044
No, thank you, sir.

81
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,503
I think I have
everything I need.

82
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:58,966
Sir, we should inform you
that research

83
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:00,341
is not the only avenue
we've been pursuing.

84
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:01,468
(<i> softly</i> ):
Miles!

85
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,011
He needs to know.

86
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:06,223
Whatever's going on,
I want to know it right now.

87
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:12,020
We're... trying to lure
someone from Section 31

88
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,230
here to the station.

89
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,522
Section 31?

90
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,316
What do they have
to do with this?

91
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,567
We believe that
they were responsible

92
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,319
for infecting Odo
in the first place.

93
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,904
What?

94
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,322
We believe that he became
infected three years ago

95
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,782
when he underwent
a medical examination

96
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,910
at Starfleet
Headquarters.

97
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,328
O'BRIEN:
Evidently,
Section 31 hoped

98
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,289
that Odo would
transmit the disease

99
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:32,373
to the other Founders
when he linked with them.

100
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,584
Genocide...

101
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:42,801
committed by people who call
themselves Federation citizens.

102
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,512
Why didn't you come to me
earlier with this?

103
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,016
Sir, we felt that...

104
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,934
Miles wanted to
tell you, sir

105
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:51,977
but I ordered
him not to.

106
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,520
It's my fault.

107
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,106
I'm still waiting for an answer
to my question.

108
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,483
We have no proof.

109
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,777
Besides, I knew that if we
told you what we suspected

110
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,196
you'd feel obliged to inform

111
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:03,404
Starfleet Command,
and once you did that

112
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,073
Section 31
would realize

113
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:08,243
that we were on to them,
and go even deeper into hiding.

114
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:11,370
What difference did that make?

115
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,831
There came a point
when I had to admit

116
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,167
that my research
was going nowhere.

117
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,669
I couldn't find a cure
here in the lab.

118
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,296
So Miles and I decided

119
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,798
to look for one within
Section 31 itself.

120
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,925
So a few days ago,
I sent a false message

121
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,510
to Starfleet Medical

122
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,346
informing them that I had,
indeed, found a cure.

123
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:30,224
The idea is that when
Section 31 hears about it

124
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:33,101
they'll want to destroy
Julian's research

125
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,103
in order to prevent it falling
into the hands of the Dominion.

126
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,231
So you're trying to lure

127
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:39,398
one of their operatives
to the station.

128
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:41,318
Okay.

129
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,028
Let's say it works.
What then?

130
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,822
We capture him or her,
find out everything

131
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,242
they know about the disease,
who's involved

132
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:50,327
and maybe even where
to find the cure.

133
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:51,912
How do you propose to do that?

134
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,330
They're not going to be
very cooperative.

135
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,999
I, uh, managed
to get my hands

136
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,336
on a Romulan
memory scanner, sir.

137
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,922
(<i> whispers</i> ):
Oh...

138
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,174
Since<i> they're</i> illegal
in the Federation

139
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:07,135
I'll assume that's<i> another</i> 
reason you didn't come to me.

140
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,137
Yes, sir.

141
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:13,141
Well... setting aside

142
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:17,020
all the legal
and ethical issues involved...

143
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:21,482
I still think
this is a pretty long shot.

144
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,277
I do, too

145
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:25,528
but I'm afraid
it's the only shot Odo has.

146
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,299
Can't sleep?

147
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,052
No.

148
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,972
How'd you get in?

149
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,640
The lock isn't that complex.

150
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,934
What are you doing up?

151
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,894
Oh, I was running
another power test

152
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,479
on the Breen weapon.

153
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,399
I was trying
to read

154
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,567
and I kept reading
the same page

155
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:09,901
over and over again.

156
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,530
What were you reading?

157
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,574
"It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times..."

158
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:18,910
<i>A Tale of Two Cities--</i> 
my mother's favorite book.

159
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,413
I was enjoying it, too

160
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:24,499
except tonight...
my mind was elsewhere.

161
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,586
Odo?

162
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:29,754
Section 31.

163
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,590
I kept thinking
just how many people had

164
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,383
to have been involved
in the conspiracy

165
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,009
to infect him
with the disease--

166
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:40,014
computer experts, doctors,
security officers

167
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:43,101
admirals... clerks.

168
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:47,730
In the end, I came up
with<i> at least</i> 73 people.

169
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,982
For a minute there

170
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,401
I thought you were going
to say 70,000.

171
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,069
This...

172
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,154
organization...

173
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,447
this...

174
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:57,949
<i>thing...</i>
that slithered its way

175
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:00,494
into the heart
of the Federation...

176
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:02,287
it has to be destroyed.

177
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:07,375
Well, you won't get any argument
from me on that...

178
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,795
but for now,
the focus has to be Odo

179
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,422
finding him a cure.

180
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,174
That<i> has</i> to be our priority.

181
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,425
You're right.

182
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:17,760
I've had enough.

183
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,719
Have you?

184
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,221
Sure.

185
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,223
Let's sleep lightly tonight.

186
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:25,560
Section 31 may still fall
for the trap and show.

187
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,479
I'll be ready.

188
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:35,945
Lights.

189
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,282
Hello, Doctor.

190
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:42,243
I didn't think
I'd ever see<i> you</i> again.

191
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,996
I have another assignment
for you.

192
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,039
Really?

193
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,877
What a coincidence...

194
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:54,422
because<i> I</i> have an assignment
for<i> you.</i>

195
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:02,889
I take it I'm supposed
to feel shocked and humbled

196
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,807
by your ingenuity.

197
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:08,727
Frankly,
I don't care how you feel.

198
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:10,813
Bashir to O'Brien.

199
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,273
O'BRIEN (<i> on com</i> ):
Yeah?

200
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,192
Mr. Sloan is here.

201
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,277
I have him
in the containment field.

202
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,571
O'BRIEN:
I'm on my way.

203
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:18,737
Good.

204
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:19,989
Bashir out.

205
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,575
What do you want, Doctor?

206
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:24,244
Why, the same thing<i> you</i> want--

207
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,913
the cure... to Odo's disease.

208
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,498
What are you talking about?

209
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,041
You already have the cure.

210
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,589
No...

211
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:37,549
no, you don't.

212
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:41,177
Your message to Starfleet
Medical was just bait.

213
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:44,138
Which I'm happy to see
you swallowed.

214
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,764
(<i> laughing</i> )

215
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:47,892
Well...

216
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,977
you've got me.

217
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:53,189
What good do you think is going
to come of this?

218
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,524
Turning me over
to Starfleet Security

219
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:55,816
would be a waste of time.

220
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,736
You don't have a shred
of evidence.

221
00:12:57,736 --> 00:13:00,572
Oh, I'm not interested
in turning you over...

222
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:02,407
to anyone.

223
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:03,950
Wel...
(<i> grunts</i> )

224
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:24,803
Hello again.

225
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,514
Shooting an unarmed man--

226
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:29,267
that's a little ungallant,
isn't it?

227
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,518
Somehow, I didn't expect you

228
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,186
to come here
of your own volition.

229
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:35,273
Oh, you're probably right.

230
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:36,857
Hello, Chief.

231
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,026
How's the family?

232
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,861
Everyone okay
at home?

233
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:43,030
What's that supposed to mean?

234
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,532
Nothing.

235
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,825
I'd just hate
to see anything happen to them.

236
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:47,952
BASHIR:
Don't listen

237
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,621
to him, Chief.

238
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:51,289
He's just playing games
with you.

239
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:52,999
That's easy for him to say.

240
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,376
He doesn't have a wife
and children to worry about

241
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,795
but trust me, Chief--

242
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:58,379
if something<i> were</i> 
to happen to me...

243
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,464
What?

244
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:00,632
They'd be killed?

245
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:02,676
I'm disappointed in you, Sloan.

246
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:05,052
You don't usually wield
such a<i> blunt</i> instrument.

247
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,639
(<i> chuckles</i> )

248
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:10,891
So... am I supposed to guess
what's going on

249
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,186
or do I have
to lay here in terror

250
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,729
waiting for you to tell me?

251
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,731
I told you what's going on.

252
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,775
I'm going to find a cure
for Odo's disease

253
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,527
and you're going to help me.

254
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,529
What makes you think
<i>I</i> know anything about it?

255
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,238
You came here

256
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,991
because you<i> thought</i> 
I had discovered a cure

257
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,868
and you wanted
to destroy it

258
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:32,622
but, first, you'd have
to find it in my lab

259
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,457
and in order to do that,
you'd have to know

260
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:36,417
<i>exactly</i> what it was
you were looking for.

261
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,711
(<i> chuckling</i> )

262
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,546
You call that reasoning?

263
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,464
If I wanted
to eliminate your work

264
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,466
all I'd have to do
is destroy your lab.

265
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,510
Oh, no, no, no, Sloan.

266
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,178
That would be too sloppy.

267
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:49,430
You like surgical precision.

268
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,392
You came here
to destroy the cure.

269
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,976
So, somewhere
in that brain of yours

270
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,854
is the information that I want.

271
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:58,732
You really expect me
to tell you?

272
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,066
No.

273
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,569
I expect you to resist
to the bitter end.

274
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,320
We're ready.

275
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,617
Remember these?

276
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,494
Romulan mind probes.

277
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:14,288
They're not
the most pleasant of devices

278
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:16,123
but they're very efficient.

279
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:19,001
They're also illegal
in the Federation.

280
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:22,797
Oh, I hope you can appreciate
the irony of<i> that</i> statement.

281
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:27,176
I'm telling you

282
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,387
I don't know anything
about the cure.

283
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,514
Then I won't find anything,
will I?

284
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,266
If Sisko finds out
what you're do...

285
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,518
The Captain already knows
what we're doing.

286
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:36,770
We have his full support.

287
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,355
Julian...

288
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,774
I'm sorry about Odo

289
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:43,443
but I can't let you have
the cure.

290
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:48,114
I can't take a chance it'll fall
into the hands of the Founders.

291
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:51,325
I'm afraid the choice is
no longer yours, Sloan.

292
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,414
I misread you.

293
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,165
I thought you were

294
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,126
just a misguided idealist

295
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,378
but you're a dangerous man.

296
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,715
People like you
would destroy the Federation

297
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,341
if given a chance.

298
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:10,344
Fortunately,
there are people like me

299
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,430
who will die to protect it.

300
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,768
(<i> grunting</i> )

301
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:17,894
Damn!

302
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:18,978
What's going on?

303
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,020
He's trying to kill himself.

304
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,355
He's activated

305
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,649
a neuro-depolarizing
device in his brain.

306
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:23,775
I have to stabilize him

307
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:25,401
before he does
irreversible damage.

308
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,527
If he dies...

309
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,987
The cure for Odo
dies with him!

310
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:37,455
(<i> console beeping</i> )

311
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,375
O'BRIEN:
What's the verdict?

312
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,252
Well, he's stable for now

313
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,213
but the neuro-depolarizer
did damage his brain.

314
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:49,342
Even on full life support,
his higher cortical functions

315
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,260
will fail within
the next hour.

316
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:55,598
He committed suicide...

317
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:58,518
just to prevent us
finding the cure.

318
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,521
We had him cornered
and he knew it.

319
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:04,607
He just couldn't let
one of Section 31's

320
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,943
darkest secrets
get away from him.

321
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,277
The frustrating
thing is

322
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,237
the cure's still
in there somewhere.

323
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:13,366
Julian, this might sound
a bit morbid, but...

324
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:17,328
what if you were to use your
Romulan mental probes now?

325
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,205
His memory pathways
have been scrambled--

326
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:22,041
probably to prevent someone
from doing just that.

327
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:26,170
There must be<i> some</i> way
to retrieve that data.

328
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,673
Well, maybe we should just
let him die in peace.

329
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:31,258
Miles...

330
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,427
I need a multitronic
engrammatic interpreter.

331
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,180
Or maybe I'll find you

332
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,224
a multitronic engrammatic
interpreter.

333
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,980
This is crazy.

334
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,315
Oh, it'll work.

335
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:55,324
You have me rerouting so many
power relays and transfer coils

336
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,577
I can't guarantee
any of this will work

337
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,495
without running
a series of diagnostics.

338
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,622
I've already done
the diagnostics, Miles

339
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,082
in my head.

340
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,252
The neural interface
will then provide

341
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,629
a basic pattern to
my hippocampal nuclei.

342
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,381
(<i> frustrated sigh</i> )

343
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:11,925
I give up.

344
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:13,634
You've explained it
to me three times

345
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,969
and I still don't get it.

346
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,721
You just have to
trust me, Chief.

347
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,389
I know what I'm doing.

348
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:23,227
But, now even if you<i> can</i>
link minds with Sloan

349
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,812
how are you going
to find the cure?

350
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,188
The entire experience

351
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,148
will be processed
into images and sounds

352
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,401
that my conscious mind
can comprehend.

353
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,152
In essence, I will see

354
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,738
the neuronal pathways
in Sloan's brain

355
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:35,656
as literal pathways...

356
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:38,076
or streets or corridors
or something.

357
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:40,202
Oh, so you're
just going to...

358
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,288
wander around
these streets

359
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,498
looking for a little box
labeled "The Cure."

360
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,209
As strange as it sounds,
it may be just that simple

361
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,669
or it may be a good deal
more surrealistic.

362
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,504
I may wind up in memories
of Sloan's childhood.

363
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,927
Will he be...

364
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:58,596
you know,<i> aware</i> of
what you're doing?

365
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,140
I won't know that
till I'm in there.

366
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:05,812
We don't know what

367
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,688
the conscious mind
can perceive

368
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,023
this close to
brain death.

369
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,320
How will you get out?

370
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,405
One of the advantages
of being genetically-enhanced

371
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,950
is the ability to control
my own vital signs.

372
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,119
When I find a cure
and I want to get out

373
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:23,079
I'll send my hypothalamus
a signal

374
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,956
to raise my blood
pressure 40 percent

375
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:28,126
and the equipment will
automatically break the link.

376
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:30,003
What if you get disoriented,
or...

377
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:32,797
lost in some nightmare
of Sloan's

378
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:34,966
and he dies while
you're still in there?

379
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:38,678
Worst-case scenario--
I die with him, I suppose

380
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,554
but I think
that's a manageable risk.

381
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,890
I'm going with you.

382
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,767
What?
You heard me.

383
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,226
And it's not open to debate.

384
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:47,937
If you're determined to go

385
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:50,940
on this lunatic mission
inside Sloan's head

386
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,109
then somebody with an ounce
of sanity has to be with you.

387
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,861
You just want to come
because you don't want

388
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:56,779
Captain Sisko to find
out what we're doing.

389
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:59,281
Well, there's that, too.

390
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,159
I better get another bed.

391
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,166
How long have we got?

392
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:11,418
Sloan's brain's going to die
in about 43 minutes.

393
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:14,172
We have that long to get in,
find the cure...

394
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:16,132
and get out.

395
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:18,676
The analyzer's on line.

396
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:20,636
Are you ready?

397
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:24,264
No...

398
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,392
but let's do it anyway.

399
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,239
Jules?

400
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,241
Miles.

401
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,660
Why are we in a turbolift?

402
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,579
I'm not sure.

403
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,957
I don't remember
getting in here.

404
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,375
We're in Sloan's mind...

405
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,752
remember?

406
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:55,796
Sloan.

407
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,340
But we're really still...

408
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,134
in the lab.

409
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:01,677
Yes.

410
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,180
This turbolift
is just an abstraction.

411
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,640
Then where are we going?

412
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,808
I don't know...

413
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,309
(<i> speed increases rapidly</i> )

414
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,811
but we're not wasting any time
getting there.

415
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,319
Aren't you glad
you came along?

416
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,821
Oh, I wouldn't have
missed it for the world.

417
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,531
(<i> turbolift slows and stops</i> )

418
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,162
So, what do you think?

419
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,957
I think we stopped.

420
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:32,666
Are you sure?

421
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,461
Either that, or we're falling
very, very slowly.

422
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,591
You mean we can let go?

423
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,053
I don't see why not.

424
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:47,347
Well?

425
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:48,557
Well, what?

426
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:49,809
You first.

427
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,060
Oh, no.

428
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,853
This little trip wasn't my idea.

429
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,273
All right.

430
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:56,774
We'll let go together.

431
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:58,317
On the count of three.

432
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,070
One...
One...

433
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,488
two...
two...

434
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:05,616
three.
three.

435
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:09,996
See?

436
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:12,206
Nothing to worry about.

437
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:13,666
I wasn't worried.

438
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,542
(<i> dropping with a loud crash)</i>

439
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:19,338
What now?

440
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,380
Good question.

441
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:23,717
Doctor, Chief O'Brien.

442
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,178
Welcome.

443
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:27,763
I can't tell you
how happy I am to see you.

444
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,308
Well, we're glad
you're happy, Sloan.

445
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:33,560
Now, tell us how to cure Odo
and we can all be happy.

446
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,979
Believe me, Doctor

447
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:36,522
nothing would give
me greater pleasure

448
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:37,857
but first, there
are a few people

449
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,275
I'd like you to meet.

450
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:42,195
Look, Sloan, we're a
bit pressed for time.

451
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:43,570
But you just arrived.

452
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:48,868
Oh... I see.

453
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:51,495
You're afraid that if I die
while you're still in here

454
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,831
you'll die, too.

455
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:56,374
Yes... well, we can't let
that happen, can we?

456
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:58,002
We'd better hurry.

457
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:00,671
We're not going anywhere
till you give us the cure.

458
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:02,298
All right.

459
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:04,217
If you insist.

460
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:07,720
It... it's a simple nucleotide
marking sequence.

461
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,387
Radodine...

462
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:11,224
(<i> slightly garbled</i> ):
uh, lidestolinine...

463
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:13,934
(<i> electronically</i>
<i>garbled voice</i> )

464
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,561
Would you mind repeating that?

465
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,980
(<i> electronically</i>
<i>garbled voice</i> )

466
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,233
We're not playing
games, Sloan!

467
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:23,110
Believe me, I want to tell you
what you need to know.

468
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,111
Then tell us.

469
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,445
I can't.

470
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:28,949
(<i> electronically</i>
<i>garbled voice</i> )

471
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:29,992
Do you see?

472
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,410
I suppose there's
some part of me

473
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,121
that doesn't
want you to know.

474
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:37,083
Well, not until you come
to the Wardroom.

475
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,335
Maybe we should do as he says.

476
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:41,837
I don't blame you
for being suspicious

477
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,589
but if you want the cure

478
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,799
you're going
to have to trust me...

479
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,301
and the clock is ticking.

480
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:48,719
He's right about that.

481
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:52,890
Follow me.

482
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,397
Relax, Doctor.

483
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:01,648
I'm the one who's dying,
not you.

484
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:02,942
Why Deep Space 9?

485
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,484
Excuse me?

486
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:06,486
I'm just wondering why
the inside of your head

487
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:08,072
looks like our
space station.

488
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:10,199
I wanted you to feel at home,
comfortable.

489
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:11,658
Why?

490
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,702
I thought it was
the decent thing to do.

491
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,419
Everyone...

492
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:23,379
if I could have your
attention, please.

493
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:26,173
Now that we're all here,
I hope you'll forgive me

494
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,342
if I take a moment
and say a few words.

495
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,179
As I stand here...

496
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,932
reunited with my friends
and my family

497
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:38,227
for one last time,
I want you

498
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:42,064
the people I love,
to know just how sorry I am

499
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:46,444
for all the pain
that I've caused you.

500
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:50,030
I dedicated my life
to the preservation

501
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,242
and the protection
of the Federation.

502
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:56,454
This duty, which I carried out
to the best of my ability

503
00:24:56,454 --> 00:24:58,789
took precedence over
everything else--

504
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:03,543
my parents, my wife,
my children.

505
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:07,214
I lived in a world of secrets...

506
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,590
of sabotage

507
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,633
and deceit.

508
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:12,136
I spent so
much time...

509
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:14,221
erasing my
movements

510
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,556
covering
my tracks

511
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:18,642
that now, as I look back
on my life...

512
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,520
I find nothing.

513
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,232
It's as if I never
really existed.

514
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:31,447
I cheated you all
out of being in my life...

515
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:35,575
and what's more,
I cheated myself, as well.

516
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:39,997
Now, I know a simple apology
won't change that.

517
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:42,708
Still, I feel the need
to apologize anyway.

518
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:45,919
No tears, please.

519
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,464
My death isn't
a tragedy

520
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:51,300
it's a celebration.

521
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:55,012
In death, I can finally
step out of the shadows

522
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:58,724
and prove to myself
that I existed...

523
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:01,060
that I lived.

524
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,104
(<i> applause</i> )

525
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:16,492
That was beautiful, Luther.

526
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:29,380
Gentlemen...

527
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,382
I'd like you to meet
my wife, Jessica.

528
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:35,344
This is Dr. Bashir,
Chief O'Brien.

529
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:37,471
If it weren't for them,
I wouldn't be here.

530
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:40,433
I'd like to thank you for
all you've done for Luther

531
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:42,226
and me.

532
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:46,272
Frankly, being married
to him was a living hell...

533
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:48,606
but thanks to you

534
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:50,359
that's all changed.

535
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,027
Well, congratulations.

536
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:55,155
Doctor, you've been
a beacon of light to me.

537
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:58,367
You're living proof
that ideology

538
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:01,370
is a poor substitute
for kindness and decency

539
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,997
and that at the end of the day,
it's our actions

540
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,832
and not our beliefs
that define

541
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:07,042
who we are

542
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,044
what we are.

543
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,213
Yes... I mean, thank you.

544
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:14,300
I'm... I'm very glad
to have been helpful.

545
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,760
Um... but if
you don't mind...

546
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,388
You want me to tell you
how to cure Odo.

547
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:21,014
Gladly, Doctor.

548
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:24,351
My dear, I need that padd
I gave you for safekeeping.

549
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,395
Oh, yes, I think
I have it here.

550
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:29,731
Thanks, muffin.

551
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,317
Here you go, Doctor.

(<i> Jessica screaming</i> )

553
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:34,487
I'm sorry, Doctor

554
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:36,447
but I can't let you have that.

555
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:44,288
Julian...

556
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:46,873
Don't look at me
for explanations.

557
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:02,764
I knew it.

558
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,433
Knew what?

559
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:06,393
That this wasn't
going to be easy.

560
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:18,614
(<i> door opens</i> )

561
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,866
SISKO:
Do you mind telling me
what's going on here?

562
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,993
I have no idea.

563
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:24,370
The Chief was
supposed to come

564
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,871
fix my sonic shower
this morning

565
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,080
but he never showed up.

566
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,124
I asked the computer
where he was

567
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,293
and when I came in,
this is what I found.

568
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,796
Have any idea
who this is?

569
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,757
Sloan. He works
for Section 31.

570
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:40,135
Then I guess this
isn't some kind

571
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,346
of obscure
meditation therapy.

572
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:44,306
Definitely not.

573
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:45,599
Sisko to Infirmary.

574
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:47,100

Infirmary.

575
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,228
Send a medical team
to Science Lab 4 right away.

576
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:50,604
Aye, sir.

577
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:53,023
I wish I knew how long
we've been in here.

578
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:54,608
23 minutes
and 11 seconds.

579
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:56,193
Show-off.

580
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:57,570
That leaves us
less than 20 minutes

581
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,071
to find a cure
and get out.

582
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:04,201
Locked-- all locked.

583
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:06,912
Sloan could be hiding
in any one of these rooms.

584
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:08,539
Or he could have taken
that turnoff we passed.

585
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:09,707
What's your point, Miles?

586
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:10,790
He's not going
to be found

587
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,000
unless he wants
to be found.

588
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,210
I mean, it's his
playing field.

589
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,670
MALE:
You two--

590
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,754
stop right there.

591
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,963
Now what?

592
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,757
You're in a restricted area.

593
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,051
I thought we were
in the cerebellum.

594
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:22,261
(<i> sighing</i> )

595
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:23,679
We're looking for Sloan.

596
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,139
Mr. Sloan's not available
at the moment.

597
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,933
Damn it, we-we don't
have time for this.

598
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,727
We need to speak
to Sloa...

599
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:31,729
(<i> groaning</i> )

600
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:33,188
You shot him!

601
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,565
That really hurt.

602
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:36,275
He was a threat
to the Federation.

603
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,443
Yeah?

604
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:41,821
(<i> groaning</i> )

605
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:49,246
You all right?

606
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:51,290
Do I look all right?

607
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,750
(<i> both panting</i> )

608
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,167
It doesn't make sense.

609
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,002
I mean, if none
of this is real

610
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,504
why does it hurt so much?

611
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,632
Well, Sloan's mind
must be sending

612
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:01,007
sensory stimuli
into ours

613
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:03,009
causing us to
experience pain--

614
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:05,679
just as we would had
we really been shot.

615
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,098
Of course, that's
just a theory.

616
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:09,725
Oh. Well, that makes sense.

617
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:13,019
Maybe this is a good time
for you to get us out of here.

618
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:15,188
I can't.

619
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,650
What do you mean,
you can't?

620
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,859
I just tried--

621
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:22,780
the hypothalamic
feedback loop.

622
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,864
I must be too weak.

623
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:26,950
What do you mean,
you're too weak?

624
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,661
Julian, we have
to get out of here!

625
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:31,664
I know that,
but I've been shot.

626
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:33,666
At least my body
thinks I have.

627
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,168
Well...

628
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:38,003
I don't believe this.

629
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,132
I'm sorry.

630
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:45,927
Well, so... this is it?

631
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,971
It does look that way.

632
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:51,350
Oh...

633
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:54,770
I should have left
a note for Keiko

634
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,022
to let her know
what we were planning.

635
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,357
Ah, why worry her?

636
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:00,066
No, I want her
and the kids

637
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:01,943
to understand why
I had to do this.

638
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,278
She'll understand.
She'll know.

639
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,113
You did it for me.

640
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,783
That's what'll upset her
the most.

641
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,328
She always said I...

642
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:14,122
I liked you more
than I liked her.

643
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:17,334
That-that-that's
ridiculous.

644
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:19,211
Right.

645
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,296
Well, maybe-maybe
you do...

646
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:22,881
a bit more.

647
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,133
What? Are you crazy?

648
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,426
She's my wife.

649
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:27,803
I love her.

650
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:29,888
Of course you love her.
She's your wife.

651
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:30,806
Yeah.

652
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:32,307
I'm just saying

653
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,685
maybe you like me a
bit more, that's all.

654
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:36,895
I do not.

655
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,735
You spend more
time with me.

656
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:44,277
We<i> work</i> together.

657
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,738
We have more in common.

658
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,949
Julian, you are
beginning to annoy me.

659
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:53,286
Darts, racquetball,

00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:56,206

need I go on?

661
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:58,333
I<i> love</i> my wife.

00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:02,921
And I love Ezri,
passionately.

663
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,005
You do?

664
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,257
Yes.

665
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:06,759
Have you told her?

666
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:08,051
Not yet...

667
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:10,053
but I will.

668
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,304
Oh, yeah? Ha!

669
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,264
When?

670
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:13,640
When I'm ready.

671
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:18,186
It's just that
I like you...

672
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,439
a bit more.

673
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:23,108
See, there,
I've admitted it.

674
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,405
Yeah, well...

675
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:31,784
I love my wife.

676
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:37,122
What's that?

677
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,753
O'BRIEN:
It's the tunnel.

678
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:44,129
What tunnel?

679
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:46,339
You know, the...

680
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:49,968
the tunnel
to the Great Beyond.

681
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:53,597
Oh... it is.

682
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:55,974
I must say, I'm
a bit disappointed.

683
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,769
I expected it
to be more elaborate.

684
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:01,855
No...

685
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:04,733
No, no, no.
Come on, come on, we ca...

686
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:10,238

waiting for... death.

Come on, come on.

Let's check one more door.

What's the point?

691
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,999
The point is to do our duty
right up until the end.

00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:24,127
Like Travis
and Crockett?

693
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,879

I'm fine.

No, I'm afraid not.

We can't risk losing you
as well.

He can't die...

00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:52,447
not yet.

You're not getting away from me
that easily, Sloan.

00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:43,456
Doctor...

720
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,750
It's over, Julian.

721
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,959
He's gone.

722
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,759
And so is any hope
of curing Odo.

723
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,938
I'm sorry, Odo.

724
00:35:05,938 --> 00:35:08,440
I wish I had better news.

725
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:11,902
I understand, Doctor.

726
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:14,613
You've done
everything you could...

727
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:17,657
more than I would
have thought possible.

728
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,284
I appreciate it.

729
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:21,160
Is there anything I can do

730
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,204
to make you feel
more comfortable?

731
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,831
Thank you

732
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:28,418
but right now,
I'd simply like to be alone.

733
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:30,712
Of course.

734
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,927
How'd he take it?

735
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:38,762
(<i> sighing</i> )

736
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:41,514
You know, better
than I would've.

737
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,141
(<i> sighing</i> )

738
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,560
I need some sleep.
So do you.

739
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:48,730
Look, Julian...
No. I know.

740
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,608
I know. I did
all I could.

741
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:53,652
That is a small
comfort, isn't it?

742
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:23,056
"It was the best of times..."?

743
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:24,557
"It was the worst of times."

744
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:25,934
Well, it's the first
line of the book.

745
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:27,102
That's right.

746
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:28,687
So why is it there
on page 294?

747
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:30,814
Well, it must
be a misprint.

748
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:32,941
The book starts
over again.

749
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,567
It can't be--
Ezri loaned it to me

750
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,069
and before that,
it was Jadzia's

751
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:37,654
and I know for a<i> fact</i> 
that she read it.

752
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:39,072
You and Ezri are
exchanging books?

753
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:40,323
Oh, forget about that.

754
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,867
Don't you see
what's going on?

755
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:43,743
Yeah, she's playing a
practical joke on you.

756
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:46,121
No, she isn't.
It's Sloan.

757
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:47,706
We're still inside his mind.

758
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,166
What are you
talking about?

759
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:50,416
These are my quarters.

760
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:51,668
Keiko's asleep
in that room.

761
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:52,794
No, she isn't.

762
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:54,253
Sloan's drawing
on our memories

763
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:55,547
making us think
we're back on the station.

764
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:56,882
That's why
the book's incomplete--

765
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:58,758
because I hadn't
finished reading it.

766
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,635
And because you don't
know what happens

767
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,345
after page 294...

768
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,263
He couldn't fill in
the rest of the story.

769
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:06,391
He's trying to stop us
finding the cure.

770
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:08,434
We must have been
close to finding it.

771
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:12,271
That door we were about to open
when we woke up...

772
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:14,024
the cure must be in there.

773
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:16,609
(<i> deep rumbling</i> )

774
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:17,986
What's happening?

775
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:19,071
Sloan's dying.
His mind's shutting down.

776
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:20,155
We haven't got much time.

777
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,419
(<i> deep rumbling</i> )

778
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:40,800
This is it.

779
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,968
Are you sure?

780
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,553
I can tell.

781
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,648
Sloan?

782
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:56,733
(<i> rumbling</i> )

783
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:03,198
Welcome to Section 31,
gentlemen.

784
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:05,408
You know exactly
why we're here.

785
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,578
You don't really expect me
to help you.

786
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,553
Are you sure
you want to throw

787
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,180
that one away?

788
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,848
I'm collecting
medical information

789
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,016
not surveillance reports.

790
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:32,852
That's not just any report.

791
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:35,230
That's on Jaresh-Inyo.

792
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,065
The former President Inyo?

793
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,566
The one and only.

794
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:46,491
My God...
31 had a man in his cabinet.

795
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:50,453
Don't let him distract you.

796
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,705
Just one of the little nuggets

797
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:55,667
lying around
in this once tidy room.

798
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,461
You'd be amazed
at what you could find.

799
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:00,130
Current operations on Kronos.

800
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:02,966
Chancellor Martok would love
to get his hands on this.

801
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:06,845
Julian...

802
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:09,430
look at this.

803
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,891
Radodine, lidestolinine,
asporanine, adenine.

804
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,185
That's it.

805
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:16,604
I think it's time
we got out of here.

806
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:17,563
Hold on a minute.

807
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:18,690
What for?

808
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,025
These files-- they contain

809
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:21,484
all of Sloan's memories
on Section 31.

810
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:22,819
With this information

811
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:24,487
we can destroy the
entire organization.

812
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:27,532
That'll have to wait!

813
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:29,201
It's not that simple, Chief.

814
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:30,493
There is no building

815
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:34,413
no room like this
in the real world.

816
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:37,125
Section 31<i> has</i> 
no headquarters.

817
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:39,294
These files...

818
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:43,589
they exist only in the minds
of a very select group of people

819
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:46,301
and I happen to be one of them.

820
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:53,725
If you really want to destroy
Section 31

821
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:56,019
it's now or never.

822
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:57,436
He's right.

823
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,521
This is a once-in-a-
lifetime opportunity.

824
00:39:58,521 --> 00:39:59,647
We can't pass it up.

825
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:01,900
Julian!

826
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,942
What?!
Listen to me.

827
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,069
He wants us to die with him.

828
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:06,071
If we die, Odo dies, too.

829
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:08,865
SLOAN:
All my secrets

830
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:11,617
yours for the taking, Doctor...

831
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:14,871
if you want them badly enough.

832
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:16,455
Odo needs you, Julian.

833
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:17,707
He's counting on you.

834
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:24,714
You're making
a terrible mistake, Doctor.

835
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:30,053
I don't think so.

836
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:37,310
EZRI:
Julian?

837
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,644
Are you with us?

838
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:41,398
Ezri...

839
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:44,525
you look so... beautiful.

840
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:49,239
Did you locate
the cure?

841
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:51,241
I think so...

842
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:56,204
but there's only one way
to know for sure.

843
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:57,496
Sloan?

844
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:59,540
SISKO:
He died about
two minutes ago.

845
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,294
He almost took you with him.

846
00:41:02,294 --> 00:41:04,963
Hey, Julian,
next time you take a trip

847
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:08,133
inside someone's mind,
you're going on your own.

848
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:09,926
Right.

849
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:21,229
I should warn you,
you may feel some discomfort.

850
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:24,107
If you mean
it's going to be painful

851
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:25,524
just say so.

852
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:28,236
It's going to be painful.

853
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:30,989
All right, then.

854
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:32,865
Go ahead.

855
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,287
(<i> gasping</i> )

856
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:42,000
(<i> groaning</i> )

857
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,267
(<i> relieved sigh</i> )

858
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:11,529
So, when will Odo
be up and around again?

859
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,572
Well, his
morphogenic matrix

860
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,283
needs a little
time to heal

861
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:17,076
but he should be
his old self

862
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:18,119
in a couple of days.

863
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:19,996
Aha!

864
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:21,831
Here we go.

865
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:24,834
I knew Quark was hoarding
a bottle of the good stuff.

866
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:26,961
This is older
than I am.

867
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,004
What?!

868
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:33,176
I'm drinking with a child.

869
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:35,261
(<i> chuckles</i> )

870
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,474
To aging... gracefully.

871
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:41,226
Very funny.

872
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:42,935
To Odo.

873
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,025
Wow.

874
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:50,693
Wow is right.

875
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:54,531
Tell me something.

876
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:57,867
If you'd had more time

877
00:42:57,867 --> 00:43:00,786
to read the data
in Sloan's mind

878
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:03,622
do you think we would've
brought down Section 31?

879
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:05,542
Ah, we'll never
know now, will we?

880
00:43:05,542 --> 00:43:06,959
But one thing's for sure--

881
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:09,795
Sloan<i> knew</i> he had
the perfect bait

882
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:11,714
that I wouldn't be
able to resist it

883
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,966
but there was one thing
he failed to consider.

884
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:15,009
And what's that?

885
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:15,968
You.

886
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:19,180
To Miles Edward O'Brien.

887
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:22,641
To friendship.

888
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,105
Oh.

889
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:28,689
Ah.

890
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:30,066
Ah.

891
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:32,610
Well, I better get home.

892
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,653
Keiko is holding
dinner for me.

893
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:35,947
This late?

894
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:38,157
Yeah, well,
she's a hell of a woman.

895
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:39,658
That's why you love her.

896
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:40,993
Mmm, that's right.

897
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,870
That's why I love her.

898
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,752
You want to come?

899
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:50,795
Sure.
