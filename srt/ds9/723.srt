1
00:00:02,697 --> 00:00:07,538
Chief Medical Officer's Log,
Stardate 52645.7.

2
00:00:07,575 --> 00:00:11,846
Colonel Kira, Garak and Odo
have returned to the station.

3
00:00:11,884 --> 00:00:14,857
Despite my best efforts,
I have yet to make any progress

4
00:00:14,891 --> 00:00:17,887
toward finding a cure
for Odo's disease.

5
00:00:20,069 --> 00:00:21,732
How long do I have?

6
00:00:22,808 --> 00:00:24,334
I can't be sure.

7
00:00:24,378 --> 00:00:27,476
You can make an educated guess.

8
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,686
I could, but first, I'd like
to talk about slowing down

9
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:33,095
the progress of the disease
with a series

10
00:00:33,131 --> 00:00:34,430
of nadion bursts.

11
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:37,736
I want a time frame, Doctor.

12
00:00:38,743 --> 00:00:42,912
A week... maybe two
with the nadion therapy.

13
00:00:42,952 --> 00:00:44,785
Thank you.

14
00:00:44,824 --> 00:00:47,193
Now I want to see Kira.

15
00:00:47,229 --> 00:00:50,725
Let me emphasize, Odo,
that I haven't given up hope

16
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,264
and it's very important
that you don't give up, either.

17
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:54,608
Understood.

18
00:00:54,644 --> 00:00:58,642
Now, please...
let me see Kira.

19
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,178
How do you feel?

20
00:01:25,212 --> 00:01:26,841
Better.

21
00:01:26,882 --> 00:01:32,292
This contraption of Julian's
seems to alleviate the pain.

22
00:01:32,328 --> 00:01:33,797
Good.

23
00:01:36,336 --> 00:01:38,272
You should be going soon.

24
00:01:38,308 --> 00:01:40,438
I'm not going anywhere.

25
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,418
Damar and Garak can lead
the rebellion without me.

26
00:01:43,452 --> 00:01:46,721
Damar needs someone

27
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:50,460
who's actually fought
with a resistance movement.

28
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:52,597
That's you, not Garak.

29
00:01:52,639 --> 00:01:57,446
I am not leaving
until I know that you're...

30
00:01:57,483 --> 00:02:01,014
I want... you... to leave.

31
00:02:01,057 --> 00:02:02,890
Why?

32
00:02:06,403 --> 00:02:13,249
You... watched Bareil die
in this very room.

33
00:02:13,285 --> 00:02:16,656
I know how that's haunted you.

34
00:02:16,692 --> 00:02:19,859
I don't want
your last memory of me

35
00:02:19,899 --> 00:02:23,863
to be witnessing my death.

36
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:31,018
Isn't that my choice?

37
00:02:31,057 --> 00:02:34,326
Maybe it is...

38
00:02:34,364 --> 00:02:38,031
and maybe I'm being selfish

39
00:02:38,072 --> 00:02:42,241
telling you
all the things I want

40
00:02:42,282 --> 00:02:49,390
but I don't want...
the last thing I see...

41
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:53,872
to be... pain in your eyes.

42
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:59,746
You'd be surprised how well
I can hide my feelings...

43
00:02:59,786 --> 00:03:00,845
when I need to.

44
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,882
Not from me.

45
00:03:04,764 --> 00:03:07,760
You have to go, Nerys.

46
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,942
All right.

47
00:03:19,998 --> 00:03:21,592
Uh...

48
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:26,077
I-I can't be
a very pleasant sight.

49
00:03:27,815 --> 00:03:31,050
I don't care how you look.

50
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,772
I've got so much to say, I...

51
00:03:42,814 --> 00:03:44,306
I don't know where to begin.

52
00:03:45,921 --> 00:03:47,914
Just say you love me.

53
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:50,123
That's all
I've ever cared about.

54
00:03:53,204 --> 00:03:56,200
I love you, Odo.

55
00:03:56,244 --> 00:03:59,979
I love you, Nerys.

56
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:03,754
After I finished the tests,
I forwarded the schematics

57
00:04:03,794 --> 00:04:06,027
of the Breen weapon
to Starfleet Engineering.

58
00:04:06,065 --> 00:04:07,762
They should have
a preliminary repor...

59
00:04:07,803 --> 00:04:10,833
Garak and I should
be getting underway.

60
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,003
The Commander is correct.

61
00:04:12,045 --> 00:04:14,243
We have to evade several
Jem'Hadar patrols

62
00:04:14,284 --> 00:04:16,414
in order to reach Damar's base.

63
00:04:16,454 --> 00:04:17,581
If we wait too long

64
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:19,754
they may alter
their patrol routes.

65
00:04:19,795 --> 00:04:23,462
Chief... is there anything else
before they go?

66
00:04:23,571 --> 00:04:26,270
No, sir. I think we have
all the data we need.

67
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,781
Well, then.

68
00:04:28,815 --> 00:04:30,614
Good hunting to you both.

69
00:04:32,991 --> 00:04:34,016
Thank you, sir.

70
00:04:36,967 --> 00:04:38,834
Julian...

71
00:04:38,871 --> 00:04:40,272
I'll do everything I can.

72
00:04:46,755 --> 00:04:48,281
Doctor?

73
00:04:48,325 --> 00:04:50,421
Is there anything
I can do to help?

74
00:04:50,463 --> 00:04:52,194
Any additional resources
you might want

75
00:04:52,233 --> 00:04:53,360
from Starfleet Medical?

76
00:04:53,403 --> 00:04:54,530
No, thank you, sir.

77
00:04:54,572 --> 00:04:56,439
I think I have
everything I need.

78
00:04:56,476 --> 00:04:59,540
Sir, we should inform you
that research

79
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,485
is not the only avenue
we've been pursuing.

80
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,488
Miles!

81
00:05:02,523 --> 00:05:03,787
He needs to know.

82
00:05:03,825 --> 00:05:06,798
Whatever's going on,
I want to know it right now.

83
00:05:09,171 --> 00:05:12,406
We're... trying to lure
someone from Section 31

84
00:05:12,444 --> 00:05:13,879
here to the station.

85
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:15,007
Section 31?

86
00:05:15,051 --> 00:05:16,987
What do they have
to do with this?

87
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:18,354
We believe that they
were responsible

88
00:05:18,391 --> 00:05:19,951
for infecting Odo
in the first place.

89
00:05:19,995 --> 00:05:21,396
What?

90
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:24,028
We believe that he became
infected three years ago

91
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,131
when he underwent
a medical examination

92
00:05:26,175 --> 00:05:27,336
at Starfleet Headquarters.

93
00:05:27,377 --> 00:05:29,006
Evidently, Section 31 hoped

94
00:05:29,047 --> 00:05:30,539
that Odo would
transmit the disease

95
00:05:30,584 --> 00:05:32,987
to the other Founders
when he linked with them.

96
00:05:33,992 --> 00:05:35,187
Genocide...

97
00:05:37,366 --> 00:05:43,209
committed by people who call
themselves Federation citizens.

98
00:05:43,245 --> 00:05:46,115
Why didn't you come to me
earlier with this?

99
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:49,381
Sir, we felt that...

100
00:05:49,426 --> 00:05:51,293
Miles wanted to tell you, sir

101
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,924
but I ordered him not to.

102
00:05:52,967 --> 00:05:54,266
It's my fault.

103
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,797
I'm still waiting for an answer
to my question.

104
00:05:56,842 --> 00:05:58,835
We have no proof.

105
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,613
Besides, I knew that if we
told you what we suspected

106
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:02,985
you'd feel obliged to inform

107
00:06:03,022 --> 00:06:04,548
Starfleet Command,
and once you did that

108
00:06:04,592 --> 00:06:05,787
Section 31 would realize

109
00:06:05,828 --> 00:06:08,960
that we were on to them,
and go even deeper into hiding.

110
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:12,169
What difference did that make?

111
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:14,008
There came a point
when I had to admit

112
00:06:14,046 --> 00:06:15,743
that my research
was going nowhere.

113
00:06:15,783 --> 00:06:18,186
I couldn't find a cure
here in the lab.

114
00:06:18,222 --> 00:06:20,124
So Miles and I decided

115
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,597
to look for one within
Section 31 itself.

116
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,069
So a few days ago,
I sent a false message

117
00:06:25,105 --> 00:06:26,300
to Starfleet Medical

118
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,173
informing them that I had,
indeed, found a cure.

119
00:06:28,211 --> 00:06:30,876
The idea is that when
Section 31 hears about it

120
00:06:30,917 --> 00:06:33,480
they'll want to destroy
Julian's research

121
00:06:33,523 --> 00:06:35,858
in order to prevent it falling
into the hands of the Dominion.

122
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,762
So you're trying to lure

123
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:40,134
one of their operatives
to the station.

124
00:06:40,171 --> 00:06:41,970
Okay.

125
00:06:42,008 --> 00:06:43,875
Let's say it works.
What then?

126
00:06:43,912 --> 00:06:46,281
We capture him or her,
find out everything

127
00:06:46,317 --> 00:06:48,652
they know about the disease,
who's involved

128
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:51,058
and maybe even
where to find the cure.

129
00:06:51,095 --> 00:06:52,359
How do you propose to do that?

130
00:06:52,397 --> 00:06:54,196
They're not going to be
very cooperative.

131
00:06:54,234 --> 00:06:57,035
I, uh, managed to get my hands

132
00:06:57,074 --> 00:07:00,172
on a Romulan memory scanner,
sir.

133
00:07:00,215 --> 00:07:02,584
Oh...

134
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,750
Since they're illegal
in the Federation

135
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,889
I'll assume that's another
reason you didn't come to me.

136
00:07:07,932 --> 00:07:09,663
Yes, sir.

137
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:13,809
Well... setting aside

138
00:07:13,844 --> 00:07:17,545
all the legal
and ethical issues involved...

139
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:22,290
I still think
this is a pretty long shot.

140
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,027
I do, too

141
00:07:24,067 --> 00:07:26,300
but I'm afraid
it's the only shot Odo has.

142
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,600
Can't sleep?

143
00:09:52,937 --> 00:09:54,132
No.

144
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,807
How'd you get in?

145
00:09:57,848 --> 00:09:59,647
The lock isn't that complex.

146
00:09:59,685 --> 00:10:00,710
What are you doing up?

147
00:10:00,754 --> 00:10:02,918
Oh, I was running
another power test

148
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,292
on the Breen weapon.

149
00:10:05,832 --> 00:10:07,267
I was trying to read

150
00:10:07,302 --> 00:10:08,327
and I kept reading
the same page

151
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:09,931
over and over again.

152
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,106
What were you reading?

153
00:10:13,148 --> 00:10:15,278
"It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times..."

154
00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:18,884
<i>A Tale of Two Cities...</i>
my mother's favorite book.

155
00:10:18,928 --> 00:10:21,024
I was enjoying it, too

156
00:10:21,065 --> 00:10:24,334
except tonight...
my mind was elsewhere.

157
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:27,376
Odo?

158
00:10:27,413 --> 00:10:29,543
Section 31.

159
00:10:29,585 --> 00:10:31,384
I kept thinking
just how many people had

160
00:10:31,455 --> 00:10:33,288
to have been involved
in the conspiracy

161
00:10:33,326 --> 00:10:35,057
to infect him
with the disease...

162
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:40,104
computer experts, doctors,
security officers

163
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,136
admirals... clerks.

164
00:10:44,551 --> 00:10:47,615
In the end, I came up
with at least 73 people.

165
00:10:47,657 --> 00:10:48,784
For a minute there

166
00:10:48,827 --> 00:10:51,264
I thought you were going
to say 70,000.

167
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:52,996
This...

168
00:10:53,036 --> 00:10:54,265
organization...

169
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:55,432
this...

170
00:10:55,508 --> 00:10:57,945
thing...
that slithered its way

171
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,451
into the heart
of the Federation...

172
00:11:00,486 --> 00:11:02,183
it has to be destroyed.

173
00:11:03,592 --> 00:11:07,363
Well, you won't get any argument
from me on that...

174
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:10,932
but for now,
the focus has to be Odo

175
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,376
finding him a cure.

176
00:11:12,412 --> 00:11:14,143
That has to be our priority.

177
00:11:14,182 --> 00:11:15,515
You're right.

178
00:11:16,888 --> 00:11:17,856
I've had enough.

179
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:18,858
Have you?

180
00:11:18,893 --> 00:11:20,192
Sure.

181
00:11:20,228 --> 00:11:22,061
Let's sleep lightly tonight.

182
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,540
Section 31 may still fall
for the trap and show.

183
00:11:25,574 --> 00:11:27,407
I'll be ready.

184
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:36,055
Lights.

185
00:11:37,935 --> 00:11:39,404
Hello, Doctor.

186
00:11:39,437 --> 00:11:42,273
I didn't think
I'd ever see you again.

187
00:11:42,311 --> 00:11:44,942
I have another assignment
for you.

188
00:11:44,983 --> 00:11:46,144
Really?

189
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,925
What a coincidence...

190
00:11:50,963 --> 00:11:54,562
because I have an assignment
for you.

191
00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:02,884
I take it I'm supposed
to feel shocked and humbled

192
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,892
by your ingenuity.

193
00:12:04,927 --> 00:12:08,800
Frankly,
I don't care how you feel.

194
00:12:08,836 --> 00:12:10,897
Bashir to O'Brien.

195
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,239
Yeah?

196
00:12:12,277 --> 00:12:14,304
Mr. Sloan is here.

197
00:12:14,347 --> 00:12:16,408
I have him
in the containment field.

198
00:12:16,453 --> 00:12:17,580
I'm on my way.

199
00:12:17,621 --> 00:12:18,748
Good.

200
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,985
Bashir out.

201
00:12:20,027 --> 00:12:21,587
What do you want, Doctor?

202
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,295
Why, the same thing you want...

203
00:12:24,336 --> 00:12:26,933
the cure... to Odo's disease.

204
00:12:26,975 --> 00:12:28,501
What are you talking about?

205
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:30,208
You already have the cure.

206
00:12:33,723 --> 00:12:35,693
No...

207
00:12:35,728 --> 00:12:37,698
no, you don't.

208
00:12:37,732 --> 00:12:41,331
Your message to Starfleet
Medical was just bait.

209
00:12:41,374 --> 00:12:44,210
Which I'm happy to see
you swallowed.

210
00:12:46,017 --> 00:12:47,987
Well...

211
00:12:48,022 --> 00:12:50,049
you've got me.

212
00:12:50,093 --> 00:12:53,328
What good do you think is going
to come of this?

213
00:12:53,367 --> 00:12:54,893
Turning me over
to Starfleet Security

214
00:12:54,937 --> 00:12:55,996
would be a waste of time.

215
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,906
You don't have a shred
of evidence.

216
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,710
Oh, I'm not interested
in turning you over...

217
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,515
to anyone.

218
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,180
Wel...

219
00:13:22,865 --> 00:13:24,892
Hello again.

220
00:13:24,936 --> 00:13:26,769
Shooting an unarmed man...

221
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:29,404
that's a little ungallant,
isn't it?

222
00:13:29,446 --> 00:13:30,710
Somehow, I didn't expect you

223
00:13:30,749 --> 00:13:32,343
to come here
of your own volition.

224
00:13:32,386 --> 00:13:35,359
Oh, you're probably right.

225
00:13:35,392 --> 00:13:37,021
Hello, Chief.

226
00:13:37,062 --> 00:13:39,158
How's the family?

227
00:13:39,201 --> 00:13:41,034
Everyone okay at home?

228
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:43,098
What's that supposed to mean?

229
00:13:43,143 --> 00:13:44,407
Nothing.

230
00:13:44,445 --> 00:13:46,973
I'd just hate
to see anything happen to them.

231
00:13:47,018 --> 00:13:49,387
Don't listen to him, Chief.

232
00:13:49,423 --> 00:13:51,450
He's just playing games
with you.

233
00:13:51,495 --> 00:13:52,896
That's easy for him to say.

234
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:55,528
He doesn't have a wife
and children to worry about

235
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:56,764
but trust me, Chief...

236
00:13:56,806 --> 00:13:58,537
if something were
to happen to me...

237
00:13:58,576 --> 00:13:59,601
What?

238
00:13:59,645 --> 00:14:00,613
They'd be killed?

239
00:14:00,648 --> 00:14:02,413
I'm disappointed in you, Sloan.

240
00:14:02,452 --> 00:14:05,219
You don't usually wield
such a blunt instrument.

241
00:14:08,064 --> 00:14:10,900
So... am I supposed to guess
what's going on

242
00:14:10,937 --> 00:14:13,101
or do I have
to lay here in terror

243
00:14:13,142 --> 00:14:14,941
waiting for you to tell me?

244
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,574
I told you what's going on.

245
00:14:16,616 --> 00:14:19,053
I'm going to find a cure
for Odo's disease

246
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:20,786
and you're going to help me.

247
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:22,956
What makes you think
I know anything about it?

248
00:14:22,997 --> 00:14:24,466
You came here

249
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,994
because you thought
I had discovered a cure

250
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:28,633
and you wanted to destroy it

251
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:32,410
but, first, you'd have
to find it in my lab

252
00:14:32,451 --> 00:14:34,284
and in order to do that,
you'd have to know

253
00:14:34,322 --> 00:14:36,589
exactly what it was
you were looking for.

254
00:14:37,629 --> 00:14:39,360
You call that reasoning?

255
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,336
If I wanted
to eliminate your work

256
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,637
all I'd have to do
is destroy your lab.

257
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:45,269
Oh, no, no, no, Sloan.

258
00:14:45,312 --> 00:14:47,145
That would be too sloppy.

259
00:14:47,183 --> 00:14:49,279
You like surgical precision.

260
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:52,556
You came here
to destroy the cure.

261
00:14:52,595 --> 00:14:54,462
So, somewhere
in that brain of yours

262
00:14:54,499 --> 00:14:56,162
is the information that I want.

263
00:14:56,203 --> 00:14:58,936
You really expect me
to tell you?

264
00:14:58,975 --> 00:15:00,239
No.

265
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:02,842
I expect you to resist
to the bitter end.

266
00:15:02,884 --> 00:15:04,683
We're ready.

267
00:15:08,464 --> 00:15:09,831
Remember these?

268
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,860
Romulan mind probes.

269
00:15:11,904 --> 00:15:14,569
They're not
the most pleasant of devices

270
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,477
but they're very efficient.

271
00:15:16,514 --> 00:15:19,350
They're also illegal
in the Federation.

272
00:15:19,387 --> 00:15:23,192
Oh, I hope you can appreciate
the irony of that statement.

273
00:15:26,169 --> 00:15:27,296
I'm telling you

274
00:15:27,338 --> 00:15:29,707
I don't know anything
about the cure.

275
00:15:29,743 --> 00:15:31,907
Then I won't find anything,
will I?

276
00:15:31,948 --> 00:15:33,542
If Sisko finds out
what you're do...

277
00:15:33,585 --> 00:15:35,715
The Captain already knows
what we're doing.

278
00:15:35,757 --> 00:15:37,056
We have his full support.

279
00:15:37,093 --> 00:15:39,656
Julian...

280
00:15:39,698 --> 00:15:41,099
I'm sorry about Odo

281
00:15:41,135 --> 00:15:43,606
but I can't let you have
the cure.

282
00:15:43,641 --> 00:15:48,448
I can't take a chance it'll fall
into the hands of the Founders.

283
00:15:48,485 --> 00:15:51,549
I'm afraid the choice is
no longer yours, Sloan.

284
00:15:55,233 --> 00:15:56,702
I misread you.

285
00:15:56,736 --> 00:16:00,507
I thought you were
just a misguided idealist

286
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:02,708
but you're a dangerous man.

287
00:16:02,749 --> 00:16:06,211
People like you
would destroy the Federation

288
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:07,692
if given a chance.

289
00:16:07,727 --> 00:16:10,631
Fortunately,
there are people like me

290
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,899
who will die to protect it.

291
00:16:17,281 --> 00:16:18,408
Damn!

292
00:16:18,451 --> 00:16:19,419
What's going on?

293
00:16:19,453 --> 00:16:20,443
He's trying to kill himself.

294
00:16:20,488 --> 00:16:21,456
He's activated

295
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:22,925
a neuro-depolarizing device
in his brain.

296
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,087
I have to stabilize him

297
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,861
before he does
irreversible damage.

298
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,868
If he dies...

299
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,462
The cure for Odo dies with him!

300
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,284
What's the verdict?

301
00:16:41,356 --> 00:16:42,985
Well, he's stable for now

302
00:16:43,026 --> 00:16:45,965
but the neuro-depolarizer
did damage his brain.

303
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,733
Even on full life support,
his higher cortical functions

304
00:16:48,772 --> 00:16:50,799
will fail within the next hour.

305
00:16:52,046 --> 00:16:55,076
He committed suicide...

306
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,921
just to prevent us
finding the cure.

307
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:01,091
We had him cornered
and he knew it.

308
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:04,037
He just couldn't let
one of Section 31's

309
00:17:04,072 --> 00:17:06,543
darkest secrets
get away from him.

310
00:17:06,578 --> 00:17:07,739
The frustrating thing is

311
00:17:07,781 --> 00:17:09,648
the cure's still
in there somewhere.

312
00:17:09,685 --> 00:17:12,783
Julian, this might sound
a bit morbid, but...

313
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:16,560
what if you were to use your
Romulan mental probes now?

314
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,730
His memory pathways
have been scrambled...

315
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:21,470
probably to prevent someone
from doing just that.

316
00:17:21,511 --> 00:17:25,475
There must be some way
to retrieve that data.

317
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,287
Well, maybe we should just
let him die in peace.

318
00:17:28,325 --> 00:17:30,523
Miles...

319
00:17:30,564 --> 00:17:33,035
I need a multitronic
engrammatic interpreter.

320
00:17:34,439 --> 00:17:35,532
Or maybe I'll find you

321
00:17:35,575 --> 00:17:37,842
a multitronic engrammatic
interpreter.

322
00:17:41,221 --> 00:17:43,488
This is crazy.

323
00:17:43,526 --> 00:17:45,724
Oh, it'll work.

324
00:17:49,272 --> 00:17:54,945
You have me rerouting so many
power relays and transfer coils

325
00:17:54,984 --> 00:17:57,045
I can't guarantee
any of this will work

326
00:17:57,089 --> 00:17:59,082
without running
a series of diagnostics.

327
00:17:59,126 --> 00:18:01,324
I've already done
the diagnostics, Miles

328
00:18:01,365 --> 00:18:02,526
in my head.

329
00:18:03,904 --> 00:18:05,840
The neural interface
will then provide

330
00:18:05,874 --> 00:18:08,072
a basic pattern to
my hippocampal nuclei.

331
00:18:10,085 --> 00:18:11,280
I give up.

332
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,153
You've explained it
to me three times

333
00:18:13,191 --> 00:18:14,490
and I still don't get it.

334
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:16,258
You just have to trust me,
Chief.

335
00:18:16,298 --> 00:18:18,063
I know what I'm doing.

336
00:18:19,372 --> 00:18:22,834
But, now even if you can
link minds with Sloan

337
00:18:22,879 --> 00:18:24,712
how are you going
to find the cure?

338
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,775
The entire experience

339
00:18:25,818 --> 00:18:27,481
will be processed
into images and sounds

340
00:18:27,522 --> 00:18:29,891
that my conscious mind
can comprehend.

341
00:18:29,927 --> 00:18:31,726
In essence, I will see

342
00:18:31,766 --> 00:18:33,395
the neuronal pathways
in Sloan's brain

343
00:18:33,469 --> 00:18:35,166
as literal pathways...

344
00:18:35,206 --> 00:18:37,643
or streets or corridors
or something.

345
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,809
Oh, so you're just going to...

346
00:18:39,849 --> 00:18:41,819
wander around these streets

347
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,824
looking for a little box
labeled "The Cure."

348
00:18:43,858 --> 00:18:46,557
As strange as it sounds,
it may be just that simple

349
00:18:46,597 --> 00:18:48,260
or it may be a good deal
more surrealistic.

350
00:18:48,301 --> 00:18:50,203
I may wind up in memories
of Sloan's childhood.

351
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,416
Will he be...

352
00:18:55,451 --> 00:18:58,218
you know, aware
of what you're doing?

353
00:18:58,256 --> 00:19:00,727
I won't know that
till I'm in there.

354
00:19:04,437 --> 00:19:05,405
We don't know what

355
00:19:05,506 --> 00:19:07,339
the conscious mind can perceive

356
00:19:07,376 --> 00:19:08,936
this close to brain death.

357
00:19:12,154 --> 00:19:13,987
How will you get out?

358
00:19:14,024 --> 00:19:16,291
One of the advantages
of being genetically-enhanced

359
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,631
is the ability to control
my own vital signs.

360
00:19:18,668 --> 00:19:21,003
When I find a cure
and I want to get out

361
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,737
I'll send my hypothalamus
a signal

362
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:24,645
to raise my blood
pressure 40 percent

363
00:19:24,681 --> 00:19:27,813
and the equipment will
automatically break the link.

364
00:19:27,855 --> 00:19:29,916
What if you get disoriented,
or...

365
00:19:29,959 --> 00:19:32,430
Lost in some nightmare
of Sloan's

366
00:19:32,465 --> 00:19:34,663
and he dies
while you're still in there?

367
00:19:34,703 --> 00:19:38,404
Worst-case scenario...
I die with him, I suppose

368
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:40,209
but I think
that's a manageable risk.

369
00:19:41,451 --> 00:19:42,476
I'm going with you.

370
00:19:42,587 --> 00:19:44,454
- What?
- You heard me.

371
00:19:44,492 --> 00:19:46,086
And it's not open to debate.

372
00:19:46,129 --> 00:19:47,655
If you're determined to go

373
00:19:47,699 --> 00:19:50,603
on this lunatic mission
inside Sloan's head

374
00:19:50,638 --> 00:19:52,836
then somebody with an ounce
of sanity has to be with you.

375
00:19:52,877 --> 00:19:54,608
You just want to come
because you don't want

376
00:19:54,647 --> 00:19:56,378
Captain Sisko to find
out what we're doing.

377
00:19:56,418 --> 00:19:58,889
Well, there's that, too.

378
00:19:58,923 --> 00:20:00,256
I better get another bed.

379
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:07,640
How long have we got?

380
00:20:07,675 --> 00:20:10,807
Sloan's brain's going to die
in about 43 minutes.

381
00:20:10,849 --> 00:20:13,753
We have that long to get in,
find the cure...

382
00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:15,759
and get out.

383
00:20:15,793 --> 00:20:18,424
The analyzer's on line.

384
00:20:18,466 --> 00:20:20,402
Are you ready?

385
00:20:21,406 --> 00:20:23,934
No...

386
00:20:23,978 --> 00:20:25,971
but let's do it anyway.

387
00:20:38,143 --> 00:20:39,840
Jules?

388
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,873
Miles.

389
00:20:41,918 --> 00:20:44,287
Why are we in a turbolift?

390
00:20:44,323 --> 00:20:46,293
I'm not sure.

391
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:49,631
I don't remember
getting in here.

392
00:20:49,735 --> 00:20:51,034
We're in Sloan's mind...

393
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,438
remember?

394
00:20:52,474 --> 00:20:55,310
Sloan.

395
00:20:55,348 --> 00:20:57,842
But we're really still...

396
00:20:57,886 --> 00:20:59,856
in the lab.

397
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,484
Yes.

398
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:03,828
This turbolift
is just an abstraction.

399
00:21:03,866 --> 00:21:06,360
Then where are we going?

400
00:21:06,405 --> 00:21:07,532
I don't know...

401
00:21:08,744 --> 00:21:10,475
but we're not wasting any time
getting there.

402
00:21:17,162 --> 00:21:18,756
Aren't you glad
you came along?

403
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,428
Oh, I wouldn't have
missed it for the world.

404
00:21:26,516 --> 00:21:27,815
So, what do you think?

405
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,615
I think we stopped.

406
00:21:30,658 --> 00:21:32,491
Are you sure?

407
00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:35,126
Either that, or we're falling
very, very slowly.

408
00:21:38,008 --> 00:21:40,001
You mean we can let go?

409
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,686
I don't see why not.

410
00:21:45,524 --> 00:21:46,857
Well?

411
00:21:46,893 --> 00:21:48,088
Well, what?

412
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:49,291
You first.

413
00:21:49,332 --> 00:21:50,699
Oh, no.

414
00:21:50,735 --> 00:21:52,568
This little trip wasn't my idea.

415
00:21:52,606 --> 00:21:54,839
All right.

416
00:21:54,878 --> 00:21:56,472
We'll let go together.

417
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,041
On the count of three.

418
00:21:58,085 --> 00:22:00,818
- One...
- One...

419
00:22:00,858 --> 00:22:02,157
- two...
- two...

420
00:22:03,931 --> 00:22:05,298
- three.
- Three.

421
00:22:07,539 --> 00:22:09,509
See?

422
00:22:09,544 --> 00:22:11,777
Nothing to worry about.

423
00:22:11,815 --> 00:22:13,216
I wasn't worried.

424
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:18,853
What now?

425
00:22:18,898 --> 00:22:19,888
Good question.

426
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:23,239
Doctor, Chief O'Brien.

427
00:22:23,274 --> 00:22:24,971
Welcome.

428
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:27,608
I can't tell you
how happy I am to see you.

429
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:30,087
Well, we're glad
you're happy, Sloan.

430
00:22:30,122 --> 00:22:33,653
Now, tell us how to cure Odo
and we can all be happy.

431
00:22:33,696 --> 00:22:34,721
Believe me, Doctor

432
00:22:34,766 --> 00:22:36,463
nothing would give
me greater pleasure

433
00:22:36,503 --> 00:22:38,063
but first,
there are a few people

434
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,370
I'd like you to meet.

435
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:42,108
Look, Sloan, we're
a bit pressed for time.

436
00:22:42,149 --> 00:22:43,310
But you just arrived.

437
00:22:45,957 --> 00:22:48,758
Oh... I see.

438
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:51,461
You're afraid that if I die
while you're still in here

439
00:22:51,502 --> 00:22:53,735
you'll die, too.

440
00:22:53,774 --> 00:22:56,371
Yes... well, we can't let
that happen, can we?

441
00:22:56,413 --> 00:22:57,882
We'd better hurry.

442
00:22:57,917 --> 00:23:00,445
We're not going anywhere
till you give us the cure.

443
00:23:00,489 --> 00:23:02,356
All right.

444
00:23:02,393 --> 00:23:04,329
If you insist.

445
00:23:04,364 --> 00:23:08,135
It... it's a simple nucleotide
marking sequence.

446
00:23:08,172 --> 00:23:09,471
Radodine...

447
00:23:09,508 --> 00:23:11,205
uh, lidestolinine...

448
00:23:13,785 --> 00:23:15,345
Would you mind repeating that?

449
00:23:17,961 --> 00:23:20,194
We're not playing games, Sloan!

450
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,102
Believe me, I want to tell you
what you need to know.

451
00:23:23,139 --> 00:23:24,107
Then tell us.

452
00:23:24,141 --> 00:23:25,474
I can't.

453
00:23:28,951 --> 00:23:29,941
Do you see?

454
00:23:30,955 --> 00:23:32,481
I suppose there's
some part of me

455
00:23:32,526 --> 00:23:33,927
that doesn't want you to know.

456
00:23:33,962 --> 00:23:36,935
Well, not until you come
to the Wardroom.

457
00:23:36,968 --> 00:23:39,201
Maybe we should do as he says.

458
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,803
I don't blame you
for being suspicious

459
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:43,508
but if you want the cure

460
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,611
you're going
to have to trust me...

461
00:23:45,655 --> 00:23:46,871
and the clock is ticking.

462
00:23:47,004 --> 00:23:48,473
He's right about that.

463
00:23:51,213 --> 00:23:52,648
Follow me.

464
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,091
Relax, Doctor.

465
00:23:59,131 --> 00:24:01,432
I'm the one who's dying,
not you.

466
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,631
Why Deep Space 9?

467
00:24:02,672 --> 00:24:04,005
Excuse me?

468
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:06,172
I'm just wondering why
the inside of your head

469
00:24:06,213 --> 00:24:07,512
looks like our space station.

470
00:24:07,616 --> 00:24:09,780
I wanted you to feel at home,
comfortable.

471
00:24:09,822 --> 00:24:11,257
Why?

472
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:13,455
I thought it was
the decent thing to do.

473
00:24:19,175 --> 00:24:21,042
Everyone...

474
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:23,072
if I could have your attention,
please.

475
00:24:23,118 --> 00:24:25,783
Now that we're all here,
I hope you'll forgive me

476
00:24:25,823 --> 00:24:27,919
if I take a moment
and say a few words.

477
00:24:29,598 --> 00:24:31,568
As I stand here...

478
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:34,573
reunited with my friends
and my family

479
00:24:34,675 --> 00:24:37,910
for one last time, I want you

480
00:24:37,949 --> 00:24:41,582
the people I love,
to know just how sorry I am

481
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:46,192
for all the pain
that I've caused you.

482
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:49,571
I dedicated my life
to the preservation

483
00:24:49,608 --> 00:24:52,775
and the protection
of the Federation.

484
00:24:52,816 --> 00:24:56,187
This duty, which I carried out
to the best of my ability

485
00:24:56,223 --> 00:24:58,421
took precedence over
everything else...

486
00:24:58,462 --> 00:25:03,167
my parents, my wife,
my children.

487
00:25:03,206 --> 00:25:06,907
I lived in a world of secrets...

488
00:25:06,947 --> 00:25:09,510
of sabotage and deceit.

489
00:25:09,552 --> 00:25:11,887
I spent so much time...

490
00:25:11,924 --> 00:25:16,229
erasing my movements,
covering my tracks

491
00:25:16,267 --> 00:25:18,465
that now, as I look back
on my life...

492
00:25:19,876 --> 00:25:22,313
I find nothing.

493
00:25:22,348 --> 00:25:25,081
It's as if I never
really existed.

494
00:25:27,124 --> 00:25:31,031
I cheated you all
out of being in my life...

495
00:25:31,066 --> 00:25:34,267
and what's more,
I cheated myself, as well.

496
00:25:35,442 --> 00:25:39,611
Now, I know a simple apology
won't change that.

497
00:25:39,652 --> 00:25:42,351
Still, I feel the need
to apologize anyway.

498
00:25:43,928 --> 00:25:45,659
No tears, please.

499
00:25:45,766 --> 00:25:48,203
My death isn't a tragedy

500
00:25:48,238 --> 00:25:50,835
it's a celebration.

501
00:25:50,877 --> 00:25:54,648
In death, I can finally
step out of the shadows

502
00:25:54,685 --> 00:25:58,456
and prove to myself
that I existed...

503
00:25:58,493 --> 00:26:00,794
that I lived.

504
00:26:14,195 --> 00:26:16,393
That was beautiful, Luther.

505
00:26:27,591 --> 00:26:29,185
Gentlemen...

506
00:26:29,228 --> 00:26:31,198
I'd like you to meet
my wife, Jessica.

507
00:26:31,232 --> 00:26:35,196
This is Dr. Bashir,
Chief O'Brien.

508
00:26:35,241 --> 00:26:37,405
If it weren't for them,
I wouldn't be here.

509
00:26:37,446 --> 00:26:40,385
I'd like to thank you for
all you've done for Luther

510
00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:41,888
and me.

511
00:26:41,922 --> 00:26:46,057
Frankly, being married
to him was a living hell...

512
00:26:46,098 --> 00:26:50,164
but thanks to you,
that's all changed.

513
00:26:50,207 --> 00:26:51,870
Well, congratulations.

514
00:26:51,911 --> 00:26:54,747
Doctor, you've been
a beacon of light to me.

515
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:58,187
You're living proof
that ideology

516
00:26:58,225 --> 00:27:01,026
is a poor substitute
for kindness and decency

517
00:27:01,064 --> 00:27:03,797
and that at the end of the day,
it's our actions

518
00:27:03,837 --> 00:27:08,803
and not our beliefs that define
who we are, what we are.

519
00:27:08,848 --> 00:27:10,909
Yes... I mean, thank you.

520
00:27:10,953 --> 00:27:14,154
I'm... I'm very glad
to have been helpful.

521
00:27:14,193 --> 00:27:16,596
Um... but if you don't mind...

522
00:27:16,632 --> 00:27:19,160
You want me to tell you
how to cure Odo.

523
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:20,639
Gladly, Doctor.

524
00:27:20,673 --> 00:27:24,204
My dear, I need that padd
I gave you for safekeeping.

525
00:27:24,249 --> 00:27:26,185
Oh, yes, I think I have it here.

526
00:27:27,956 --> 00:27:29,482
Thanks, muffin.

527
00:27:29,527 --> 00:27:31,156
Here you go, Doctor.

528
00:27:32,834 --> 00:27:34,360
I'm sorry, Doctor

529
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:36,465
but I can't let you have that.

530
00:27:42,522 --> 00:27:44,287
Julian...

531
00:27:44,326 --> 00:27:46,889
Don't look at me
for explanations.

532
00:28:00,695 --> 00:28:02,597
I knew it.

533
00:28:02,633 --> 00:28:04,102
Knew what?

534
00:28:04,136 --> 00:28:06,197
That this wasn't
going to be easy.

535
00:28:17,265 --> 00:28:19,429
Do you mind telling me
what's going on here?

536
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,668
I have no idea.

537
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:24,612
The Chief was supposed to come
fix my sonic shower this morning

538
00:28:24,648 --> 00:28:25,775
but he never showed up.

539
00:28:25,817 --> 00:28:27,650
I asked the computer
where he was

540
00:28:27,688 --> 00:28:30,091
and when I came in,
this is what I found.

541
00:28:31,329 --> 00:28:33,425
Have any idea who this is?

542
00:28:33,467 --> 00:28:36,337
Sloan.
He works for Section 31.

543
00:28:36,373 --> 00:28:38,844
Then I guess this isn't
some kind

544
00:28:38,879 --> 00:28:41,146
of obscure meditation therapy.

545
00:28:41,184 --> 00:28:42,847
Definitely not.

546
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:44,288
Sisko to Infirmary.

547
00:28:44,325 --> 00:28:45,554
Infirmary.

548
00:28:45,594 --> 00:28:48,464
Send a medical team
to Science Lab 4 right away.

549
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,525
Aye, sir.

550
00:28:49,569 --> 00:28:51,699
I wish I knew how long
we've been in here.

551
00:28:51,741 --> 00:28:53,438
23 minutes and 11 seconds.

552
00:28:53,478 --> 00:28:54,845
Show-off.

553
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,406
That leaves us
less than 20 minutes

554
00:28:56,451 --> 00:28:57,680
to find a cure and get out.

555
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,821
Locked... all locked.

556
00:29:02,898 --> 00:29:05,392
Sloan could be hiding
in any one of these rooms.

557
00:29:05,437 --> 00:29:07,373
Or he could have taken
that turnoff we passed.

558
00:29:07,408 --> 00:29:08,433
What's your point, Miles?

559
00:29:08,478 --> 00:29:09,468
He's not going to be found

560
00:29:09,513 --> 00:29:10,708
unless he wants to be found.

561
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:11,842
I mean, it's his playing field.

562
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:14,651
You two...
stop right there.

563
00:29:14,691 --> 00:29:15,955
Now what?

564
00:29:15,994 --> 00:29:17,691
You're in a restricted area.

565
00:29:17,731 --> 00:29:20,168
I thought we were
in the cerebellum.

566
00:29:21,305 --> 00:29:22,774
We're looking for Sloan.

567
00:29:22,809 --> 00:29:25,144
Mr. Sloan's not available
at the moment.

568
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:26,878
Damn it, we-we don't
have time for this.

569
00:29:26,918 --> 00:29:28,683
We need to speak to Sloa...

570
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:32,160
You shot him!

571
00:29:32,196 --> 00:29:33,357
That really hurt.

572
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:35,232
He was a threat
to the Federation.

573
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,329
Yeah?

574
00:29:45,696 --> 00:29:47,461
You all right?

575
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,733
Do I look all right?

576
00:29:51,075 --> 00:29:52,442
It doesn't make sense.

577
00:29:52,478 --> 00:29:54,243
I mean, if none of this is real

578
00:29:54,282 --> 00:29:55,717
why does it hurt so much?

579
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,813
Well, Sloan's mind
must be sending

580
00:29:57,857 --> 00:29:59,383
sensory stimuli into ours

581
00:29:59,427 --> 00:30:01,260
causing us to experience pain...

582
00:30:01,331 --> 00:30:04,098
just as we would had
we really been shot.

583
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:06,370
Of course, that's just a theory.

584
00:30:06,409 --> 00:30:07,844
Oh. Well, that makes sense.

585
00:30:07,879 --> 00:30:11,512
Maybe this is a good time
for you to get us out of here.

586
00:30:11,553 --> 00:30:13,523
I can't.

587
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:15,927
What do you mean, you can't?

588
00:30:15,963 --> 00:30:18,161
I just tried...

589
00:30:18,201 --> 00:30:21,105
the hypothalamic feedback loop.

590
00:30:21,141 --> 00:30:23,237
I must be too weak.

591
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,272
What do you mean,
you're too weak?

592
00:30:25,317 --> 00:30:26,911
Julian, we have
to get out of here!

593
00:30:26,954 --> 00:30:29,790
I know that,
but I've been shot.

594
00:30:29,827 --> 00:30:31,957
At least my body thinks I have.

595
00:30:33,367 --> 00:30:34,494
Well...

596
00:30:34,537 --> 00:30:36,473
I don't believe this.

597
00:30:38,412 --> 00:30:40,348
I'm sorry.

598
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:44,289
Well, so... this is it?

599
00:30:44,326 --> 00:30:46,456
It does look that way.

600
00:30:46,497 --> 00:30:49,698
Oh...

601
00:30:49,737 --> 00:30:52,904
I should have left
a note for Keiko

602
00:30:52,944 --> 00:30:55,381
to let her know
what we were planning.

603
00:30:55,416 --> 00:30:56,908
Ah, why worry her?

604
00:30:56,953 --> 00:30:58,388
No, I want her and the kids

605
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:00,449
to understand why
I had to do this.

606
00:31:00,494 --> 00:31:01,861
She'll understand.
She'll know.

607
00:31:01,898 --> 00:31:03,561
You did it for me.

608
00:31:03,601 --> 00:31:06,300
That's what'll upset her
the most.

609
00:31:08,044 --> 00:31:09,707
She always said I...

610
00:31:09,748 --> 00:31:12,549
I liked you more
than I liked her.

611
00:31:12,587 --> 00:31:15,856
That-that-that's ridiculous.

612
00:31:15,894 --> 00:31:17,693
Right.

613
00:31:17,732 --> 00:31:19,828
Well, maybe-maybe you do...

614
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:21,237
a bit more.

615
00:31:21,273 --> 00:31:23,506
What? Are you crazy?

616
00:31:23,545 --> 00:31:25,105
She's my wife.

617
00:31:25,148 --> 00:31:26,116
I love her.

618
00:31:26,151 --> 00:31:28,247
Of course you love her.
She's your wife.

619
00:31:28,288 --> 00:31:29,256
Yeah.

620
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:30,589
I'm just saying

621
00:31:30,627 --> 00:31:33,064
maybe you like me
a bit more, that's all.

622
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:35,229
I do not.

623
00:31:39,413 --> 00:31:41,110
You spend more time with me.

624
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,676
We work together.

625
00:31:42,721 --> 00:31:44,088
We have more in common.

626
00:31:45,727 --> 00:31:48,426
Julian, you are
beginning to annoy me.

627
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:51,801
Darts, racquetball,
Vic's Lounge

628
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,573
the Alamo... need I go on?

629
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:56,914
I love my wife.

630
00:31:58,555 --> 00:32:01,391
And I love Ezri, passionately.

631
00:32:01,428 --> 00:32:02,396
You do?

632
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:03,659
Yes.

633
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,169
Have you told her?

634
00:32:05,202 --> 00:32:06,397
Not yet...

635
00:32:06,506 --> 00:32:08,636
but I will.

636
00:32:08,678 --> 00:32:09,907
Oh, yeah? Ha!

637
00:32:09,946 --> 00:32:10,914
When?

638
00:32:10,948 --> 00:32:12,143
When I'm ready.

639
00:32:12,185 --> 00:32:16,593
It's just that I like you...

640
00:32:16,628 --> 00:32:18,826
a bit more.

641
00:32:18,866 --> 00:32:21,736
See, there, I've admitted it.

642
00:32:25,113 --> 00:32:27,015
Yeah, well...

643
00:32:28,621 --> 00:32:30,215
I love my wife.

644
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:35,768
What's that?

645
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:41,180
It's the tunnel.

646
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,583
What tunnel?

647
00:32:42,618 --> 00:32:44,816
You know, the...

648
00:32:44,857 --> 00:32:48,422
the tunnel to the Great Beyond.

649
00:32:48,464 --> 00:32:51,995
Oh... it is.

650
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:54,476
I must say,
I'm a bit disappointed.

651
00:32:54,512 --> 00:32:57,211
I expected it
to be more elaborate.

652
00:32:58,386 --> 00:33:00,356
No...

653
00:33:00,391 --> 00:33:03,056
No, no, no.
Come on, come on, we ca...

654
00:33:03,097 --> 00:33:08,770
we can't just sit here
waiting for... death.

655
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:10,473
Come on, on your feet, man.

656
00:33:10,547 --> 00:33:13,178
Come on, come on.

657
00:33:13,219 --> 00:33:15,018
Let's check one more door.

658
00:33:15,056 --> 00:33:16,320
What's the point?

659
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:19,594
The point is to do our duty
right up until the end.

660
00:33:19,633 --> 00:33:21,603
Like Travis and Crockett?

661
00:33:22,841 --> 00:33:24,572
One more door.

662
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:30,389
Dr. Bashir's regaining
consciousness, Captain.

663
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:34,799
How's Miles?

664
00:33:36,604 --> 00:33:38,073
I'm fine.

665
00:33:38,107 --> 00:33:41,080
Did you find the information
you were looking for?

666
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:43,051
No, I'm afraid not.

667
00:33:43,085 --> 00:33:44,384
I'm going to have to go back in.

668
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,479
Sloan is dying.

669
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:48,553
We can't risk losing you
as well.

670
00:33:48,596 --> 00:33:50,065
He can't die...

671
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,159
not yet.

672
00:33:55,412 --> 00:33:58,077
Get me cordrazine,
ten milligrams.

673
00:33:59,855 --> 00:34:01,848
His alpha waves are attenuating.

674
00:34:03,095 --> 00:34:04,324
Cortical stimulator.

675
00:34:05,434 --> 00:34:07,564
You're not getting away from me
that easily, Sloan.

676
00:34:09,877 --> 00:34:12,246
Increase the resonance
frequency ten percent.

677
00:34:12,282 --> 00:34:15,118
His neurosynaptic activity
is falling.

678
00:34:15,155 --> 00:34:16,350
I can see that!

679
00:34:16,391 --> 00:34:17,883
50 milligrams neurotropan.

680
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,565
Come on, Sloan.
Come on back!

681
00:34:22,604 --> 00:34:23,765
Complete neural failure.

682
00:34:23,808 --> 00:34:24,798
No!

683
00:34:35,232 --> 00:34:38,797
Doctor... he is dead.

684
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:42,141
Doctor...

685
00:34:42,181 --> 00:34:43,410
It's over, Julian.

686
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:44,509
He's gone.

687
00:34:49,898 --> 00:34:52,563
And so is any hope
of curing Odo.

688
00:35:02,994 --> 00:35:05,090
I'm sorry, Odo.

689
00:35:05,131 --> 00:35:07,124
I wish I had better news.

690
00:35:08,472 --> 00:35:10,442
I understand, Doctor.

691
00:35:10,477 --> 00:35:13,108
You've done
everything you could...

692
00:35:13,149 --> 00:35:16,122
more than I would
have thought possible.

693
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,624
I appreciate it.

694
00:35:17,692 --> 00:35:19,389
Is there anything I can do

695
00:35:19,429 --> 00:35:21,593
to make you feel
more comfortable?

696
00:35:21,634 --> 00:35:23,126
Thank you

697
00:35:23,171 --> 00:35:26,804
but right now,
I'd simply like to be alone.

698
00:35:26,846 --> 00:35:28,839
Of course.

699
00:35:33,962 --> 00:35:35,488
How'd he take it?

700
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:39,833
You know,
better than I would've.

701
00:35:41,545 --> 00:35:43,880
I need some sleep.
So do you.

702
00:35:45,219 --> 00:35:47,189
- Look, Julian...
- No. I know.

703
00:35:47,224 --> 00:35:50,128
I know.
I did all I could.

704
00:35:50,164 --> 00:35:52,157
That is a small comfort,
isn't it?

705
00:36:19,561 --> 00:36:21,428
"It was the best of times..."?

706
00:36:21,466 --> 00:36:22,799
"It was the worst of times."

707
00:36:22,835 --> 00:36:24,532
Well, it's the first
line of the book.

708
00:36:24,572 --> 00:36:25,540
That's right.

709
00:36:25,575 --> 00:36:27,204
So why is it there
on page 294?

710
00:36:27,246 --> 00:36:29,307
Well, it must be a misprint.

711
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:31,343
The book starts over again.

712
00:36:31,388 --> 00:36:33,187
It can't be...
Ezri loaned it to me

713
00:36:33,225 --> 00:36:34,489
and before that, it was Jadzia's

714
00:36:34,527 --> 00:36:36,156
and I know for a fact
that she read it.

715
00:36:36,198 --> 00:36:38,396
You and Ezri
are exchanging books?

716
00:36:38,436 --> 00:36:39,404
Oh, forget about that.

717
00:36:39,438 --> 00:36:40,428
Don't you see what's going on?

718
00:36:40,474 --> 00:36:42,273
Yeah, she's playing
a practical joke on you.

719
00:36:42,312 --> 00:36:44,545
No, she isn't.
It's Sloan.

720
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:46,246
We're still inside his mind.

721
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,620
What are you talking about?

722
00:36:47,657 --> 00:36:48,750
These are my quarters.

723
00:36:48,825 --> 00:36:50,158
Keiko's asleep in that room.

724
00:36:50,195 --> 00:36:51,322
No, she isn't.

725
00:36:51,364 --> 00:36:52,389
Sloan's drawing on our memories

726
00:36:52,434 --> 00:36:53,869
making us think
we're back on the station.

727
00:36:53,904 --> 00:36:55,031
That's why
the book's incomplete...

728
00:36:55,073 --> 00:36:56,372
because I hadn't
finished reading it.

729
00:36:57,378 --> 00:36:59,474
And because you don't
know what happens

730
00:36:59,516 --> 00:37:00,951
after page 294...

731
00:37:00,986 --> 00:37:02,888
He couldn't fill in
the rest of the story.

732
00:37:02,923 --> 00:37:04,916
He's trying to stop us
finding the cure.

733
00:37:04,961 --> 00:37:06,931
We must have been
close to finding it.

734
00:37:06,965 --> 00:37:10,906
That door we were about to open
when we woke up...

735
00:37:10,941 --> 00:37:12,535
the cure must be in there.

736
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:16,218
What's happening?

737
00:37:16,252 --> 00:37:17,516
Sloan's dying.
His mind's shutting down.

738
00:37:17,556 --> 00:37:18,546
We haven't got much time.

739
00:37:38,067 --> 00:37:39,331
This is it.

740
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:40,463
Are you sure?

741
00:37:40,506 --> 00:37:42,066
I can tell.

742
00:37:51,949 --> 00:37:54,113
Sloan?

743
00:37:58,463 --> 00:38:01,595
Welcome to Section 31,
gentlemen.

744
00:38:01,671 --> 00:38:03,938
You know exactly
why we're here.

745
00:38:03,975 --> 00:38:07,142
You don't really expect me
to help you.

746
00:38:22,315 --> 00:38:25,652
Are you sure you want to throw
that one away?

747
00:38:25,757 --> 00:38:27,283
I'm collecting
medical information

748
00:38:27,326 --> 00:38:28,487
not surveillance reports.

749
00:38:28,529 --> 00:38:31,330
That's not just any report.

750
00:38:31,369 --> 00:38:33,670
That's on Jaresh-Inyo.

751
00:38:33,707 --> 00:38:35,506
The former President Inyo?

752
00:38:35,544 --> 00:38:37,138
The one and only.

753
00:38:41,257 --> 00:38:44,890
My God...
31 had a man in his cabinet.

754
00:38:46,035 --> 00:38:48,905
Don't let him distract you.

755
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:51,207
Just one of the little nuggets

756
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:53,945
lying around
in this once tidy room.

757
00:38:53,985 --> 00:38:56,924
You'd be amazed
at what you could find.

758
00:38:56,958 --> 00:38:58,587
Current operations on Kronos.

759
00:38:58,629 --> 00:39:01,602
Chancellor Martok would love
to get his hands on this.

760
00:39:03,907 --> 00:39:05,308
Julian...

761
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,678
Look at this.

762
00:39:07,749 --> 00:39:10,380
Radodine, lidestolinine,
asporanine, adenine.

763
00:39:10,421 --> 00:39:11,650
That's it.

764
00:39:13,829 --> 00:39:15,058
I think it's time
we got out of here.

765
00:39:15,099 --> 00:39:16,067
Hold on a minute.

766
00:39:16,101 --> 00:39:17,330
What for?

767
00:39:17,369 --> 00:39:18,564
These files... they contain

768
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,371
all of Sloan's memories
on Section 31.

769
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:21,378
With this information

770
00:39:21,412 --> 00:39:22,938
we can destroy
the entire organization.

771
00:39:24,752 --> 00:39:26,085
That'll have to wait!

772
00:39:26,123 --> 00:39:27,649
It's not that simple, Chief.

773
00:39:27,693 --> 00:39:29,094
There is no building

774
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:32,729
no room like this
in the real world.

775
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:35,640
Section 31 has no headquarters.

776
00:39:35,676 --> 00:39:37,646
These files...

777
00:39:37,681 --> 00:39:42,055
they exist only in the minds
of a very select group of people

778
00:39:42,091 --> 00:39:44,790
and I happen to be one of them.

779
00:39:47,402 --> 00:39:52,311
If you really want to destroy
Section 31

780
00:39:52,346 --> 00:39:54,579
it's now or never.

781
00:39:54,618 --> 00:39:55,586
He's right.

782
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,919
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

783
00:39:56,957 --> 00:39:58,152
We can't pass it up.

784
00:39:59,162 --> 00:40:00,323
Julian!

785
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:01,423
- What?!
- Listen to me.

786
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:02,765
He wants us to die with him.

787
00:40:02,803 --> 00:40:04,705
If we die, Odo dies, too.

788
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:07,371
All my secrets

789
00:40:07,413 --> 00:40:10,146
yours for the taking, Doctor...

790
00:40:10,186 --> 00:40:13,387
if you want them badly enough.

791
00:40:13,427 --> 00:40:15,021
Odo needs you, Julian.

792
00:40:15,064 --> 00:40:16,397
He's counting on you.

793
00:40:20,675 --> 00:40:23,408
You're making
a terrible mistake, Doctor.

794
00:40:26,756 --> 00:40:28,749
I don't think so.

795
00:40:33,771 --> 00:40:35,798
Julian?

796
00:40:35,843 --> 00:40:37,176
Are you with us?

797
00:40:37,212 --> 00:40:39,740
Ezri...

798
00:40:39,784 --> 00:40:43,087
you look so... beautiful.

799
00:40:46,132 --> 00:40:47,863
Did you locate the cure?

800
00:40:47,902 --> 00:40:49,838
I think so...

801
00:40:51,844 --> 00:40:54,908
but there's only one way
to know for sure.

802
00:40:55,017 --> 00:40:56,110
Sloan?

803
00:40:56,154 --> 00:40:58,147
He died about two minutes ago.

804
00:40:58,191 --> 00:41:00,719
He almost took you with him.

805
00:41:00,763 --> 00:41:03,360
Hey, Julian,
next time you take a trip

806
00:41:03,403 --> 00:41:06,740
inside someone's mind,
you're going on your own.

807
00:41:06,777 --> 00:41:08,508
Right.

808
00:41:15,129 --> 00:41:19,765
I should warn you,
you may feel some discomfort.

809
00:41:19,805 --> 00:41:22,778
If you mean
it's going to be painful

810
00:41:22,812 --> 00:41:24,213
just say so.

811
00:41:24,249 --> 00:41:26,846
It's going to be painful.

812
00:41:26,888 --> 00:41:29,451
All right, then.

813
00:41:29,494 --> 00:41:31,487
Go ahead.

814
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:10,141
So, when will Odo
be up and around again?

815
00:42:10,183 --> 00:42:13,816
Well, his morphogenic matrix
needs a little time to heal

816
00:42:13,858 --> 00:42:16,831
but he should be his old self
in a couple of days.

817
00:42:16,865 --> 00:42:18,494
Aha!

818
00:42:18,535 --> 00:42:20,164
Here we go.

819
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:23,508
I knew Quark was hoarding
a bottle of the good stuff.

820
00:42:23,546 --> 00:42:25,516
This is older than I am.

821
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:26,677
What?!

822
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:31,928
I'm drinking with a child.

823
00:42:35,572 --> 00:42:38,169
To aging... gracefully.

824
00:42:38,211 --> 00:42:39,942
Very funny.

825
00:42:39,981 --> 00:42:41,644
To Odo.

826
00:42:46,262 --> 00:42:47,561
Wow.

827
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:49,192
Wow is right.

828
00:42:51,875 --> 00:42:53,242
Tell me something.

829
00:42:54,414 --> 00:42:56,475
If you'd had more time

830
00:42:56,518 --> 00:42:59,217
to read the data in Sloan's mind

831
00:42:59,257 --> 00:43:02,389
do you think we would've
brought down Section 31?

832
00:43:02,431 --> 00:43:04,401
Ah, we'll never know now,
will we?

833
00:43:04,436 --> 00:43:05,631
But one thing's for sure...

834
00:43:05,671 --> 00:43:08,302
Sloan knew he had
the perfect bait

835
00:43:08,344 --> 00:43:10,211
that I wouldn't be able
to resist it

836
00:43:10,248 --> 00:43:12,742
but there was one thing
he failed to consider.

837
00:43:12,787 --> 00:43:13,755
And what's that?

838
00:43:13,789 --> 00:43:14,757
You.

839
00:43:14,791 --> 00:43:17,923
To Miles Edward O'Brien.

840
00:43:19,267 --> 00:43:21,363
To friendship.

841
00:43:24,613 --> 00:43:25,912
Oh.

842
00:43:25,949 --> 00:43:27,248
Ah.

843
00:43:27,285 --> 00:43:28,584
Ah.

844
00:43:28,622 --> 00:43:31,219
Well, I better get home.

845
00:43:31,261 --> 00:43:33,231
Keiko is holding dinner for me.

846
00:43:33,265 --> 00:43:34,598
This late?

847
00:43:34,635 --> 00:43:36,765
Yeah, well,
she's a hell of a woman.

848
00:43:36,806 --> 00:43:38,275
That's why you love her.

849
00:43:38,309 --> 00:43:39,608
Mmm, that's right.

850
00:43:39,646 --> 00:43:41,639
That's why I love her.

851
00:43:46,996 --> 00:43:48,397
You want to come?

852
00:43:48,432 --> 00:43:49,593
Sure.
