(<i> sniffing</i> )

00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:25,609
(<i> coughing</i> )

3
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:31,072
MALE 1:
Raimus isn't going to
be happy about this.

4
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:32,950
MALE 2:
What are you
going to do?

5
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,202
MALE 3:
I don't know.

6
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,872
Don't you mean what
are<i> we</i> going to do?

7
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:40,958
Raimus told<i> you</i> to
get the merchandise.

8
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:43,502
MALE 3:
I'll figure
something out.

9
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:44,795
You better.

10
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:47,130
I said I'll
figure it out.

11
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,924
I'm hungry.

12
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:50,968
Let's have Krellan food.

13
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:53,136
No. Last time, that
gave me heartburn.

14
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,514
That's because
you eat too fast.

15
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:56,849
I eat when I'm hungry

16
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:59,351
and when I'm hungry,
I eat fast.

17
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:00,895
If you're not careful,

18
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:03,313
that appetite of yours
is going to kill you someday.

19
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,024
Don't get your hopes up.

20
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,107
Hey!

21
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,860
We're using
that com booth.

22
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,570
Go.

23
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,282
MALE 3:
Order some nozala
sandwiches.

24
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:28,797
COMPUTER:
Computer accessed.

25
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,258
Get them to deliver
some extra vilm sauce.

26
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,469
Who should I bill<i> this</i> time?

27
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,804
I don't care
who pays for it,

28
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,431
just so long
as it isn't us.

29
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:38,473
How about the police?

30
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:39,767
No.

31
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:42,227
We billed them
for last night's dinner.

32
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,729
Municipal sanitation?

33
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:46,189
Do you have
their account code?

34
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,442
I will...
in a minute.

35
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,404
(<i> gasps</i> )
Krole!

36
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,033
Don't!
Don't touch him!

37
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,325
He's being spiked!

38
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,792
(<i> gasping</i> )

39
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,585
You all right?

40
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:07,878
They spiked him.

41
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,671
They spiked him
over a free lunch!

42
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,799
What's this city
coming to?

43
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,968
Look at this! Fused.

44
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:15,719
Too bad.

45
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:18,931
That's an expensive piece
of hardware.

46
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:20,766
What are we going to do?

47
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,225
Don't you mean

48
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,811
what is<i> Krole</i>
going to do?

49
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,479
I can't go to Raimus

50
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,773
and ask him to pay
for a replacement.

51
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:31,568
Well, it might not be
as bad as it seems.

52
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,321
Are you saying you can fix it?

53
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,865
Depends.

54
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,784
On what?

55
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,953
How much you're willing to pay.

56
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,873
(<i> chuckles</i> )

57
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,334
Do you know who I am?

58
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,044
No.

59
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:52,339
Well, if you did,
you wouldn't ask that.

60
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,548
Oh. All right.

61
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,425
Who<i> are</i> you?

62
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,511
Listen, Mister, um...?

63
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,220
Connelly.

64
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,973
Yeah, I've seen you around here
these last few weeks.

65
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:02,641
You're always in here
tinkering around

66
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,392
with one piece of junk
or another,

67
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,145
which tells me

68
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:08,772
that things are not going
too well for you.

69
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:11,441
Now, here's
my advice to you.

70
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:14,277
Give it!

71
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,115
You take these...

72
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:21,785
you bring them back
tomorrow morning fixed

73
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:22,995
and polished.

74
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,832
Tomorrow morning it is.

75
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:31,920
(<i> chuckles</i> )

76
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:55,069
Bilby asked me to
fix these for him.

77
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,945
I'm impressed.

78
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,864
I don't think anyone's
managed to make contact

79
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,866
with the Orion Syndicate
so quickly.

80
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,534
How'd you do it?

81
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:05,954
I spiked one of his men
while he was interfacing.

82
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,331
That was
a risky thing to do.

83
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,417
Well, maybe...

84
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,920
but I had to get noticed.

85
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,048
I want to get this mission
over with and go home.

86
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:19,426
I realize you didn't
exactly volunteer for this.

87
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:22,846
Believe me, I wish we hadn't
been forced to turn to someone

88
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,224
outside Starfleet Intelligence
for help.

89
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:27,434
Me, too.

90
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,103
The Syndicate killed

91
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:32,064
another one of our undercover
operatives last week.

92
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:34,108
That makes five
in the last year.

93
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:35,567
We need you to find out

94
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,986
who their informant
in Starfleet is.

95
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,529
Once you give me the name,

96
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,949
I'll put you on the
next transport home.

97
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,075
(<i> glass shattering</i> )

98
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:48,455
So, what do you
want me to do now?

99
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:51,125
Bilby's going to check
into your background.

100
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,918
Whatever he finds
will confirm

101
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:55,087
that you're a fix-it man
down on your luck.

102
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:57,214
Stick to that cover.

103
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:00,008
The Syndicate is always looking
for people with your skills.

104
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,302
Bilby offers you more work,
take it.

105
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,638
Get as close to him
as possible.

106
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,306
Right.

107
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,058
O'Brien.

108
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:12,520
Don't take any more
unnecessary risks.

109
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,731
These are dangerous men.

110
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:18,401
If they find out who you are,
they'll kill you.

111
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:36,331
Excuse me, Major. I--
Major, I'm sorry--

112
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,792
Go ahead.
Go ahead.

113
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,460
There's
something--
I need a--

114
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,837
All right.
You first, then you.

115
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,547
Hmm.

116
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:47,259
I need an engineering crew
to run a diagnostic

117
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,261
on the internal
security sensors.

118
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:52,764
There's been an unusual number
of false alarms lately.

119
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:55,475
I'll have someone
take a look at it
as soon as possible.

120
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,312
Now, Quark.
There's something's wrong

121
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:00,188
with the fire-suppression
system in the bar.

122
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:03,024
Every time I serve
a flaming cocktail,

123
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,734
the system engages
and snuffs it out.

124
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,986
I'll put it on the list.

125
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,654
Please do.

126
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,281
You have no idea what
people are willing to pay

127
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:10,824
for a glass of
burning alcohol.

128
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,827
Excuse me.
Major--
Oh, let me guess.

129
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,996
There's a malfunction
in the Infirmary.

130
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,080
How did you know?

131
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,710
(<i> sighs</i> )

132
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,340
Major, there is something wrong
with the turbolift.

133
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,841
I can see that.

134
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,969
We seem to be having
a lot of system glitches.

135
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:33,554
Happens every time
Chief O'Brien goes away.

136
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,056
I do not understand
why his staff

137
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,142
cannot keep the station running
in his absence.

138
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,269
Must have left
my idiot brother
in charge.

139
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,980
The engineering
crew is doing
the best they can.

140
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,316
The problem is
no one knows how the Chief

141
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:46,693
keeps all this Federation
and Cardassian technology

142
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:47,986
working together.

143
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,904
We've got to
do something.

144
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,239
This can't go on.

145
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:57,120
Sorry, I can't discuss
the Chief's whereabouts.

146
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,164
I understand that, sir, but...

147
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,375
it's getting ridiculous,
isn't it?

148
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,085
How much longer are
we supposed to put up
with these malfunctions?

149
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,046
You know,
I wouldn't be surprised

150
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,673
if Major Kira or Commander Worf
came in here demanding answers,

151
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,134
but<i> you?</i> 
It's not your style.

152
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,387
Apparently, it is.
Here I am.

153
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,930
I'm not buying it, Doctor.

154
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,807
You didn't come
in here to complain.

155
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,893
You came here because you are
worried about your friend,

156
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,437
and you want me to set
your mind at ease.

157
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:23,980
I wish I could.

158
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,983
But if it helps,
I will tell you this.

159
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,443
The Chief can take
care of himself

160
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,487
as well as<i> anyone</i> I know.

161
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,323
You're right
about that, sir.

162
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,909
You're right about that.

163
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:00,392
Did you fix it?

164
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,110
Any feedback?

165
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,903
Feedback gives him
a headache.

166
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:14,072
No, there's no feedback.

167
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,741
Well, we'll see,
won't we?

168
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,206
I told you.

169
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,502
Very impressive.

170
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,259
You know, if I was
a suspicious man,

171
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:37,178
I might ask myself
how a tinkerer living

172
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,431
in one room
on Jinami Street

173
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:42,476
managed to fix such
a complicated piece

174
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,269
of hardware so quickly.

175
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,854
Good question.

176
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:49,232
How do you know
where I live?

177
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,485
I know a lot
about you...

178
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:54,195
maybe more than
you want me to.

179
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,572
Come with me.

For a walk.

Have a seat.

00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:25,935
Not there.

Something wrong?

You tell me.

Did you think I brought you here

I guess a man
that's been knocked around

as much as you have is always
expecting the worst, huh?

199
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:10,897
Well, I've pretty much
had to get used to the idea

200
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,065
that I've got bad luck.

201
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,066
Yeah, that was

202
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,151
a tough break on Dayos IV.

203

Two years for dealing
in stolen goods?

Well, I didn't know
they were stolen.

205
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:23,702
I guess I should have asked
the guy I bought them from, huh?

Who's to say
he'd have told you the truth?

Take this, for example.

208
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:30,083
My employer asked me to get him
three Klingon disruptors.

209

Did the man I bought them from
tell me they didn't work?

No, he did not.

211

00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:45,306
The induction coil

Can you fix it?

Sure.

Well, I'm glad to hear it.

It's going to make my employer

What does he want
with Klingon disruptors?

I didn't ask him.

When Raimus tells
you to do something,

221
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,740
you just do it.

00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,034

It's good.

Yeah, she makes it herself.

This is her.

00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,728
These are my children.

Oh...

233
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:33,980
great.

234
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,398
Where are they?

235
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,692
They're in New Sydney.

236
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:39,944
I'd love to have them
here on Farius,

237
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:44,365
but, uh, considering
the business I'm in,

238
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,950
it's not a good idea.

239
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,329
You got a family?

240
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,331
No.
You should.

241
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,667
It's the most important thing.

242
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,920
I send them everything.

243
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,547
I pay my fare to Raimus.

244
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,466
The rest goes straight
to my wife.

245
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,386
Your fare?

246
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,347
Yeah, to Raimus every month.

247
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:08,931
That's the way it works.

248
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,058
He's above me
in the organization.

249
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,689
You do know what organization
I'm referring to,

250
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:16,731
don't you?

251
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:17,732
I think so.

252
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:19,400
Good.

253
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,195
Krole and Flith,
the gentlemen you met earlier?

254
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,571
They're below me.

255
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:25,990
Lucky them.

256
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,534
If you fix

257
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:30,203
these disruptors for me,
you could be lucky, too.

258
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,287
That's good to know.

259
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,455
Don't misunderstand me.

260
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,332
I'm not promising you anything.

261
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:36,710
I just need to be sure
that I can trust you first.

262
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,880
Have some more cake.

263
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,883
No, thanks.

264
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,426
I thought you said
you were hungry.

265
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,804
Oh... I'm all right.
What's the matter?

266
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,681
Don't you like my wife's cake?

267
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,058
Oh, I didn't say that.

268
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,601
So, answer me.

it's a little dry.

Gowron mustn't

Do you have any idea why Raimus

No.

Listen, is there, uh...

291
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,291
any way
I could talk to my wife,

292
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,585
and let her know
I'm all right?

00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:35,995
Contact Raimus.

How did you get a hold
of replacement parts?

308

Klingon technology
isn't easy to come by.

Well, you know, you...

who to go to.

00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:01,103
Hmm. Why don't
you enlighten us,

in case we need
to procure something else?

Why don't you stay
out of my business?

Tell us where
you got the parts.

We can always use
a good contact.

317

I can't.

318
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,867
Why not?

319
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,160
Well, my supplier would
rather remain anonymous.

320

I don't care
about your supplier.

00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:34,303
From a warehouse on,
uh, Degora Street.

Well, why didn't
you just say so?

Well, I thought it was
better if you didn't know.

331

You know, in case the
police caught up with me.

332
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,190
You lied to me

333
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,985
because you didn't want me
to be implicated?

334
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:49,986
Yeah.

335
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,779

He's willing
to protect me

if he gets caught.

00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:02,874
And try hard as I may,

wouldn't buy anything

from a man that sold me
three useless disruptors.

00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:58,972
Those disruptors
were working fine

363
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:00,347
when I gave them to you.

364
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:03,726
What happened after that,
I don't know.

365
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:06,353
Perhaps you dropped them.

366
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,739
I want my money back.

367
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:20,118
(<i> laughing</i> )

368
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:23,245
You know I can't do that.

369
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,164
You took delivery.

370
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,000
Let me get
something straight.

371
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,210
You're telling me there
was nothing wrong with this

372
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,712
when you sold it to me.

373
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:32,964
That's correct.

374
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:34,757
Well, maybe I, uh...

375
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:38,385
just don't know
how to work it.

376
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,428
That must be it.

377
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:44,391
(<i> screams</i> )

378
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,268
Well, what do you know?

379
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,770
I figured it out.

380
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,188
Bilby--

381
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,398
Do you know
what would've happened

382
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:54,027
if I'd given Raimus
three useless disruptors?

383
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:55,653
He'd have killed me.

384
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:58,990
If you want your money back...
you can have it!

385
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,241
Why would
I want my money back?

386
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,577
It works fine now.

387
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:19,218
No one takes me for a fool.

388
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,429
I'll do whatever it takes
to protect what I have.

389
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:26,184
This life...

390
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:28,477
it isn't for everyone.

391
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,647
Sometimes I wish I could
just get away from it all.

392
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:36,152
But what would I do with myself?

393
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,613
I'm too old to start over.

394
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,450
Besides,
who am I to complain?

395
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,285
The organization's
given me opportunities

396
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,537
I never thought I would have.

397
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,916
Once you're part of it...

398
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,210
once you're accepted...

399
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,754
there's no limit
to what you can do

400
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,756
if you're smart about it.

401
00:20:58,132 --> 00:20:59,884
Smart and careful.

402
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:02,386
Glad you're paying attention.

403
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,555
I mean, we got people
everywhere...

404
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:05,973
even on Earth.

405
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,935
Hell, we've even got a man
in Starfleet.

406
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,730
Come on-- Starfleet?

407
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,731
(<i> chuckling</i> )

408
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:14,982
That's correct.

409
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,567
Hey, would you
do me a favor?

410
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:18,444
Would you remind me

411
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,487
to pick up a present
for my daughter tomorrow?

412
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,448
She's got a birthday coming up.

413
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,033
Sure thing.

414
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,661
Oh, I want to be there.

415
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,872
Sure hope I can make it.

416
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:33,960
How did you get
to someone in Starfleet?

417
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,086
It wasn't me.

418
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:36,503
It was Raimus.

419
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,589
Hey...

420
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:41,467
do you want to come
to New Sydney with me,

421
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:42,843
meet my family?

422
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:46,013
Well, if you go, yeah.

423
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,556
How'd he do it?

424
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,350
What's with
all the questions?

425
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,978
Nothing. Uh...

426
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:54,105
I just find it hard to believe

427
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:57,108
that someone in Starfleet
could be bought.

428
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:59,944
Makes me wonder
if... he's a double agent.

429
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:01,279
A double agent?

430
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:03,072
Well, why would he have
given us the names

431
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,740
of all their
undercover operatives?

432
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:07,534
Don't worry.

433
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,287
He's the real thing.

434
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:13,166
Raimus met him when he was
vacationing on Risa last year.

435
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:16,836
Mr. Starfleet was in charge
of the weather-control system.

436
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,212
Raimus offered him

437
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:20,298
a very substantial
amount of money

438
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:22,008
to make it stop raining.

439
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:24,302
(<i> chuckling</i> )

440
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:27,554
Well, everyone has
their price, I guess.

441

(<i> beeping</i> )

442
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:37,564
It's Krole.

443
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,154
Raimus wants to see me.

444
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:44,989
What, in the middle
of the night?

445
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:47,533
Hmm...

446
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:08,637
Bilby.

447
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,388
Raimus.

448
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:12,516
I brought someone
here to meet you.

449
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:20,024
I hope I didn't get
you gentlemen

450
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:22,235
out of bed.

451
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:23,819
Bilby...

452
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:26,113
who is this?

453
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,242
He's someone I know.

454
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,786
I've never seen him before.

455
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:35,039
How well do you know him?

456
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,375
I know him.

457
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:41,962
Then it's settled.

458
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:45,716
Is that the extent of your
security precautions?

459
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,260
Bilby witnessed for him.

460
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,427
That's all
that's necessary.

(<i> snickers</i> )

462
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,100
If you say so.

463
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,979
So...

464
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:01,399
this is Bilby.

465
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:03,692
He seems
capable enough.

466
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,236
I told you.

467
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:09,115
I wanted to see
for myself.

468
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:14,995
You procured the
disruptors for us?

469
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,663
That's right.

470
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:20,458
We're going to ask you
to do something else...

471
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:23,003
something very important.

472
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,756
You can count on me.

473
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:27,465
I hope so.

475
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:32,096
We'll contact you
when it's time.

Don't let me down.

477
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,147
I won't.

478
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:42,398

479
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:46,819

what I just did for you?

I think so.

485
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:11,927
I witnessed for you.

486
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,722
If anything happens...

487
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,933
I'm accountable.

488
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,559
I understand.

489
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:22,688
Good.

490
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,583
Nice suit.

491
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,336
Bilby got it for me.

492
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:46,795
That was generous.

493
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,630
He's like that.

494
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,509
I found out
who the informer is.

495
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:54,136
Bilby told me
he was in charge

496
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:56,096
of the weather-control
system on Risa

497
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,806
about a year ago.

498
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,100
It should be easy enough
to figure out who that was.

499
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,352
Yeah.

500
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:05,605
Is something wrong?

501
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:11,111
Raimus brought somebody
to meet Bilby.

502
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,279
A Vorta.

503
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:16,783
You're telling me

504
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:20,787
that the Orion Syndicate
is working for the Dominion?

505
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,915
Opens up a lot of
possibilities, doesn't it?

506
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:24,875
None of them very pleasant.

507
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,462
So, do I get
to go home now?

508
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:30,672
Not until you find out
what's going on.

509
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,677
I was afraid
you were going to say that.

All right.

I'm reading a three-tier

I see it.

514
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:55,030
It looks like
an isolation matrix
is protecting the data.

515
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,074
You'll have to bypass
the encryption lockouts.

516
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:59,493
You make it sound so easy.

517
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:01,454
Watch out
for recursive dataloops.

518
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:03,163
You don't want to get
diverted into a backflow.

I'm past the lockouts.

520
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,085
Sweep the matrix.

521
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:10,212
Give me an access point.

00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:12,714

about opening an account there.

Maybe you should go
with a different bank.

00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,729
What do you mean,
you don't want to?

546
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,607
I brought her
here for you.

547
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:12,941
I appreciate that, but--

548
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,318
But what?

549
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,156
Don't tell me
you don't like girls.

550
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:22,242
I have a girlfriend.

551
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,743
Since when?

552
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:26,038
A-a few days...

553
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,914
a week... I don't know.

554
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:30,584
That's great.
Why didn't you say anything?

555
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:31,709
I don't know.

556
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:33,546
It didn't come up.

557
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:34,754
(<i> chuckling</i> )

558
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,010
Listen, I understand,

559
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:43,556
uh, but that's no reason
to hurt this girl's feelings.

560
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:56,402
Um... we've got some
business to discuss,

561
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:58,278
so, uh, why don't you...

562
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:00,155
go on ahead home and...

563
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,699
(<i> clears throat</i> )

564
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:04,076
...I'll call you in a
couple of days, okay?

565
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:08,914
And thanks for coming over.

566
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,374
It was really nice to meet you.

567
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,132
So who is she?

568
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,551
This new girl.

569
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:23,637
Oh, her name's... Kimiko.

570
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:25,764
Where'd you meet her?

571
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,182
She works in a flower shop...

572
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,559
arranging flowers.

573
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:29,976
Well, bring her by sometime.

574
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,437
I'd like to meet her.

575
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:32,396
Yeah, I will.

576
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:33,731
A man your age,

577
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:35,815
you should settle down
and have a family.

578
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:37,610
It's the most
important thing.

579
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:40,237
I don't know
if it's that serious yet.

580
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:42,489
Well, you let me talk
to her for three minutes.

581
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,908
I'll let you know if
she's the marrying kind.

582
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,368
I can read people
right away--

583
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,745
what's in their hearts.

584
00:29:47,745 --> 00:29:49,496
You, for instance.

585
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:52,374
I saw through you the first
time I laid eyes on you.

586
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:53,292
Oh, yeah?

587
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,001
I don't think

588
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:57,337
I've ever seen anyone so
alone in my entire life.

589
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,047
I said to myself,

590
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:02,384
"That man, he doesn't have
a friend in the Quadrant."

591
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:04,928
Flith and Krole--

592
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,013
they thought
you were a snake.

593
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,307
Really?

594
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:11,935
But I knew better.

595
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,729
When you came back
that next day

596
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:15,147
with the
dataport repaired,

597
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:16,898
that's when I knew

598
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,817
we're going to do
great things together.

599
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,611
I'm about to
take a step up

600
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:22,112
in the organization.

601
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:24,030
Raimus is giving me
an opportunity,

602
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,658
and I'm going to
make the best of it.

603
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:27,409
Everything's changing.

604
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:28,868
I can feel it.

605
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:31,371
And it all started
when you came along.

606
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:32,706
You changed my luck.

607
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:34,500
I thought
you'd changed mine.

608
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,085
I'm going
to take care of you.

609
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,129
I don't forget
my friends,

610
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:41,715
'cause friends...

611
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:43,925
they're like family,

612
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,052
and nothing's
more important.

613
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:47,805
Nothing.

614
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:49,889
(<i> clink</i> )

615
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:03,862
You're late.

616
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:04,904
I was beginning to worry.

617
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:06,156
Sorry.

618
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:07,533
That's all right.

619
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:09,201
I imagine the Dominion
is keeping you busy.

620
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:10,619
No, nothing's
happened with that yet.

621
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:12,037
I was just doing
something with Bilby.

622
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:13,497
Anything worth reporting?

623
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:14,873
We went to the races.

624
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,459
We came out ahead.

625
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:20,045
I'm glad to hear that you're
enjoying your assignment.

626
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,547
Well, you told me
to get close to him.

627
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:23,173
He said he wanted to go;
I went with him.

628
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:25,008
There's no need to explain.
I've been undercover.

629
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,721
Bilby's witnessed for me.

630
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:31,264
Sounds like you've really
got your hooks into him.

631
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,435
What's going to
happen to him
when you pull me out?

632
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,521
That's nothing that you need
to think about.

633
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:39,356
They're going to kill him,
aren't they?

634
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:43,276
Listen, Bilby chose this life.

635
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:45,696
Whatever happens to him
is his fault,

636
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:47,322
not yours.

637
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,825
Besides, if he's lucky,
we'll get to him

638
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:51,076
before they do.

639
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:53,203
He'll be safe
in a Federation prison.

640
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:56,081
Just help us build a good case
against him.

641
00:31:58,375 --> 00:31:59,626
Right.

642
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,567
(<i> laughing</i> )

643
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:28,947
Good morning, Graife.

644
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:31,450
Raimus.

645
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,992
I didn't know you were coming.

646
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:34,745
I can see that.

647
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:37,372
Well, let me get you something.

648
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,124
Graife, make us
a strong pot of--

649
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:41,251
Bilby, not
right now.

650
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:43,503
This isn't a social visit.

651
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,965
Which one is it?

652
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:50,594
Wait. Don't tell me.

653
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:53,221
Let me see if I can guess.

654
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:01,146
They say you can
tell a traitor

655
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:03,440
by looking in his eyes.

656
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,944
Do you think
that's true, Bilby?

657
00:33:06,944 --> 00:33:08,445
I wouldn't know.

658
00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:13,742
Raimus, what's this all about?

659
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:16,119
What does it look like?
If you ask me,
none of them

660
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,704
look particularly
trustworthy.

661
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:23,669
Raimus--

662
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:24,711
Not now.

663
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:25,796
But--

664
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:27,547
I said not now.

665
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:40,936
Him.

666
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:44,063
I've been saying so
all along!

667
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,524
Raimus, this is crazy.

668
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:47,400
He doesn't know
what he's talking about.

669
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:54,115
He was going
to be my second guess.

670
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,326
W-what did he do?

671
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:58,620
Let's just say he conducted
some business on the side

672
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,623
and neglected to pay his fare.
I see.

673
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:04,250
It's a good thing
you never witnessed
for<i> him,</i>

674
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,336
or you'd be lying
there, too, Bilby.

675
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:09,088
(<i> nervous chuckle</i> )

676
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,340
Yeah.

677
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,802
Well, now that that's
out of the way,

678
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:17,014
shall we discuss
the matter at hand?

679
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,141
We mentioned we
might ask you

680
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,811
to do something for us.
Yeah, whatever you need.

681
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:25,856
Mmm. So accommodating.
He reminds me of a Jem'Hadar.

682
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:28,149
We want you
to assassinate

683
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,610
the Klingon Ambassador
to Farius.

684
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,237
All right.
And you'll

685
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:35,198
use the disruptors
you procured earlier.

686
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,533
O'BRIEN:
You want it to look

687
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:38,785
like he was killed
by a rival House.

688
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,453
Connelly!

689
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,747
It's all right.

690
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,166
Very astute.

691
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:48,754
Do you know much about
political affairs?

692
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:50,547
Not really.

693
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:53,675
Well, then, allow me
to enlighten you.

694
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:56,553
The Ambassador has
been advocating

695
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:58,096
that the Klingons break
off their alliance

696
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,514
with the Federation

697
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,974
and concentrate
on defending

698
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:03,476
the Empire against
the Dominion.

699
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,520
Chancellor Gowron,
on the other hand,

700
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,398
is adamantly committed
to the Alliance.

701
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:09,858
You're going to making it look

702
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:11,568
like Gowron ordered
the assassination.

703
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:12,945
Exactly.

704
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:15,614
The Ambassador will
be seen as a martyr

705
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:17,908
and his cause
will gain strength.

706
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:19,576
If all goes well,

707
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:22,829
the Klingons will retreat
into their own territory,

708
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,372
and then, all we'll
have to deal with

709
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,583
is the Federation.

710
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:29,002
Makes sense.

711
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:31,588
I'm glad you think so.

712
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:35,592
Needless to say,
it is very important

713
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:40,430
that the Dominion's part
in this remain secret.

714
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,599
If something
goes wrong,

715
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:45,518
and you're captured...

716
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,854
you never met our friend here.

717
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:50,023
I understand.

718
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,360
I knew I could count on you.

719
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,740
I never realized
how much the Dominion

720
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,034
and the Orion Syndicate
have in common.

721
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:04,788
It seems
that in both organizations...

722
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:06,581
loyalty is everything.

723
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:12,170
How are they planning
to get past the
Embassy's security?

724
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,755
Bilby asked me
the same thing.

725
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:16,341
I figured out a way
to interrupt the power grid

726
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:17,717
for a few seconds.

727
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,511
Bilby and his men
will be able to beam in

728
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,429
before the backup
generator kicks in.

729
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,098
When is this
supposed to happen?

730
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:24,141
Tonight.

731
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:25,558
I'll contact
the Klingons

732
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:27,268
so they can be
ready for them.

733
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:28,812
What are you talking about?

734
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:31,230
If the Klingons get their hands
on Bilby and his men,

735
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,691
they'll kill them.

736
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,359
That's not really our business,
is it?

737
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:36,319
You're setting them up
to be murdered?

738
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,988
You have things backwards.

739
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:40,115
Bilby and his friends
are the ones

740
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:41,658
that murder people, not us.

741
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:43,076
(<i> scoffs</i> )

742
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:44,786
We just get Klingons
to do it for us.

743
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:46,163
All I'm doing
is following

744
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:48,247
procedures
and warning our allies

745
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,416
about a possible
assassination attempt.

746
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:52,544
What happens after that
is not my concern,

747
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:55,047
but believe me,
if the Klingons go after Raimus

748
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:56,923
and the rest
of the Orion Syndicate,

749
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,133
I won't shed any tears.

750
00:36:58,133 --> 00:36:59,968
I'm sure you won't.

751
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:02,137
Miles...

752
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,557
listen to me.

753
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,227
You've lost perspective.

754
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,354
You're starting
to sympathize

755
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,940
with these people.

756
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,401
It's good
that we're pulling you out.

757
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,653
Pulling me out?

758
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,656
We're putting you
on the next transport home.

759
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,408
Your assignment's over.

760
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:27,204
You told me we were going
to make a case against Bilby.

761
00:37:27,204 --> 00:37:29,330
You told me
he was going to prison!

762
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,958
I'm sorry.
I didn't want to mislead you,

763
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,334
but you were starting to waver.

764
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,336
I needed to keep
you on track.

765
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,761
Come on.

766
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,303
Let's get you home.

767
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:45,430

Did you come
to see me off?

774
00:38:15,252 --> 00:38:16,795
We need to talk.

775
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:17,921
Have to wait.

776
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:19,047
I was just leaving.

777
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:20,090
You can't go.

778
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,674
What are you talking about?

779
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:24,928
Look, just
trust me.

780
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:26,763
You can't go.

781
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:27,847
Why not?

782
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,225
It's a trap.

783
00:38:36,148 --> 00:38:37,649
Listen to me!

784
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:39,317
The Klingons know
what you're planning to do.

785
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,986
That's impossible.

786
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:44,072
Someone traced my signal
when I accessed the power grid.

787
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:45,782
I saw you
access the grid.

788
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:47,159
You cut off the trace.

789
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:49,161
No, they just made me
<i>think</i> I had.

790
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:51,246
You're panicking.

791
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:53,456
Try not to
worry so much.

792
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,167
You're the one who should
be worried.

793
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:56,960
Do you have any idea
what the Klingons

794
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,586
will do to you
when they catch you?

795
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,338
They're not going to catch me.

796
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,965
Yes, they will.

797
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:04,383
Starfleet Intelligence
will warn them you're coming.

798
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:05,384
How do you know that?

799
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:06,594
I suppose you work for them.

800
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:13,893
What if I said I did?

801
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:17,814
Very good. You had me.
I mean, just for a minute there,

802
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:20,275
I actually thought that
you<i> were</i> working for Starfleet.

803
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:22,194
I am.

804
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:25,947
Come on.

805
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,532
That's enough.

806
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:28,992
You had me. I admit it.

807
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:31,036
I am working for Starfleet.

808
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:32,704
That's enough! I said
I don't want to hear that!

Do you understand me?

00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,290
I don't want to hear that.

00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,547
Why'd you have to come here?

812
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:45,424
Why'd you have to tell me that?

813
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:46,926
I couldn't just let you go.

814
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,761
The Klingons will kill you.

815
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,180
I'm dead already.

816
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,806
Can't you see that?

00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,350
I<i> witnessed</i> for you.

818
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,768
Do you have any idea
what that means?

819
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,645
What if I get you off Farius?

820
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,272
Find you a place to hide?

821
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:00,815
There's no hiding
from the Syndicate.

822
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,525
You know that.

823
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,861
Well, then turn yourself in.
You'll be safe in prison.

824
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:06,905
No! They'd go
after my family!

825
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:11,617
They'd make
an example of me.

826
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,376
Raimus may
leave them alone

827
00:40:19,376 --> 00:40:21,378
if he thinks that I died

not knowing
about you.

829
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:25,006
But you can't
just let them kill you.

00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:28,134
What choice do I have?

You were too good to be true.

that my luck had changed,

I never meant
for this to happen.

840
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:01,667
I wasn't after you.

841
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,836
I was just trying to find out

842
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:06,672
how the Syndicate
compromised Starfleet.

843
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:09,092
I wasn't even your target.

844
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:13,430
I suppose
I'm not important enough.

845
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:16,474
I've always known
something like this

846
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,642
might happen.

847
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,772
The smart thing would be
to kill you.

848
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,611
But I guess
I've already proved...

849
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,947
I'm not too smart.

850
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:33,199

00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:45,170
will you make sure
Chester is looked after?

Well, you took an enormous risk
by telling him.

He could have killed you.

to put everything in his report.

Bilby trusted me.

He put his life
in my hands, and...

I killed him,

just as surely as if I'd
pulled that trigger myself.

You did what you had to do--
your duty.

Is that what I'm supposed
to tell myself?

It is the truth.
