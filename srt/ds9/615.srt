1
00:00:27,987 --> 00:00:30,983
Raimus isn't going
to be happy about this.

2
00:00:31,026 --> 00:00:33,087
What are you going to do?

3
00:00:33,131 --> 00:00:34,725
I don't know.

4
00:00:36,204 --> 00:00:38,174
Don't you mean
what are we going to do?

5
00:00:38,209 --> 00:00:41,614
Raimus told you
to get the merchandise.

6
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,053
I'll figure something out.

7
00:00:44,089 --> 00:00:45,422
You better.

8
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:47,622
I said I'll figure it out.

9
00:00:47,663 --> 00:00:49,428
I'm hungry.

10
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:51,528
Let's have Krellan food.

11
00:00:51,572 --> 00:00:53,633
No. Last time,
that gave me heartburn.

12
00:00:53,676 --> 00:00:55,943
That's because you eat too fast.

13
00:00:55,981 --> 00:00:57,416
I eat when I'm hungry

14
00:00:57,451 --> 00:00:59,786
and when I'm hungry, I eat fast.

15
00:00:59,823 --> 00:01:00,950
If you're not careful

16
00:01:00,992 --> 00:01:03,657
that appetite of yours
is going to kill you someday.

17
00:01:03,698 --> 00:01:05,634
Don't get your hopes up.

18
00:01:05,669 --> 00:01:06,637
Hey!

19
00:01:06,671 --> 00:01:08,231
We're using that com booth.

20
00:01:08,342 --> 00:01:10,073
Go.

21
00:01:12,251 --> 00:01:14,848
Order some nozala sandwiches.

22
00:01:26,482 --> 00:01:29,181
Computer accessed.

23
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:31,852
Get them to deliver
some extra vilm sauce.

24
00:01:32,895 --> 00:01:34,888
Who should I bill this time?

25
00:01:34,934 --> 00:01:36,426
I don't care who pays for it

26
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,997
just so long as it isn't us.

27
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:39,031
How about the police?

28
00:01:39,076 --> 00:01:40,305
No.

29
00:01:40,412 --> 00:01:42,645
We billed them
for last night's dinner.

30
00:01:42,684 --> 00:01:44,278
Municipal sanitation?

31
00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:46,656
Do you have their account code?

32
00:01:46,693 --> 00:01:47,718
I will...

33
00:01:47,761 --> 00:01:49,025
in a minute.

34
00:01:52,004 --> 00:01:52,994
Krole!

35
00:01:55,044 --> 00:01:55,909
Don't!

36
00:01:55,946 --> 00:01:56,914
Don't touch him!

37
00:01:56,948 --> 00:01:57,938
He's being spiked!

38
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,394
You all right?

39
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:08,428
They spiked him.

40
00:02:08,474 --> 00:02:10,239
They spiked him
over a free lunch!

41
00:02:10,278 --> 00:02:12,305
What's this city coming to?

42
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:14,410
Look at this! Fused.

43
00:02:14,453 --> 00:02:16,286
Too bad.

44
00:02:16,324 --> 00:02:19,320
That's an expensive piece
of hardware.

45
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,333
What are we going to do?

46
00:02:21,368 --> 00:02:22,735
Don't you mean

47
00:02:22,772 --> 00:02:24,332
what is Krole going to do?

48
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:25,867
I can't go to Raimus

49
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:28,179
and ask him to pay
for a replacement.

50
00:02:28,217 --> 00:02:32,124
Well, it might not be
as bad as it seems.

51
00:02:33,262 --> 00:02:34,925
Are you saying you can fix it?

52
00:02:35,968 --> 00:02:37,369
Depends.

53
00:02:37,404 --> 00:02:38,337
On what?

54
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,642
How much you're willing to pay.

55
00:02:45,455 --> 00:02:47,983
Do you know who I am?

56
00:02:48,027 --> 00:02:49,394
No.

57
00:02:49,497 --> 00:02:52,800
Well, if you did,
you wouldn't ask that.

58
00:02:52,838 --> 00:02:54,171
Oh. All right.

59
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,871
Who are you?

60
00:02:55,911 --> 00:02:58,144
Listen, Mister, um?

61
00:02:58,183 --> 00:02:59,584
Connelly.

62
00:02:59,619 --> 00:03:01,521
Yeah, I've seen you around here
these last few weeks.

63
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:03,049
You're always in here
tinkering around

64
00:03:03,093 --> 00:03:04,790
with one piece of junk
or another

65
00:03:04,831 --> 00:03:06,664
which tells me

66
00:03:06,702 --> 00:03:09,105
that things are not going
too well for you.

67
00:03:09,141 --> 00:03:12,011
Now, here's my advice to you.

68
00:03:13,517 --> 00:03:14,884
Give it!

69
00:03:16,891 --> 00:03:18,383
You take these...

70
00:03:18,494 --> 00:03:22,299
you bring them back
tomorrow morning fixed

71
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:23,463
and polished.

72
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:27,545
Tomorrow morning it is.

73
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,601
Bilby asked me
to fix these for him.

74
00:03:55,642 --> 00:03:56,975
I'm impressed.

75
00:03:57,012 --> 00:03:59,449
I don't think anyone's
managed to make contact

76
00:03:59,484 --> 00:04:01,386
with the Orion Syndicate
so quickly.

77
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:02,981
How'd you do it?

78
00:04:03,025 --> 00:04:06,430
I spiked one of his men
while he was interfacing.

79
00:04:06,499 --> 00:04:08,936
That was a risky thing to do.

80
00:04:08,971 --> 00:04:10,838
Well, maybe...

81
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,313
but I had to get noticed.

82
00:04:13,348 --> 00:04:16,378
I want to get this mission
over with and go home.

83
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:19,690
I realize you didn't
exactly volunteer for this.

84
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:23,190
Believe me, I wish we hadn't
been forced to turn to someone

85
00:04:23,237 --> 00:04:25,674
outside Starfleet Intelligence
for help.

86
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:28,043
Me, too.

87
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,413
The Syndicate killed

88
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,651
another one of our undercover
operatives last week.

89
00:04:32,691 --> 00:04:34,593
That makes five
in the last year.

90
00:04:34,628 --> 00:04:35,995
We need you to find out

91
00:04:36,031 --> 00:04:38,502
who their informant
in Starfleet is.

92
00:04:38,537 --> 00:04:40,006
Once you give me the name

93
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,511
I'll put you on the
next transport home.

94
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:48,954
So, what do you
want me to do now?

95
00:04:48,993 --> 00:04:51,658
Bilby's going to check
into your background.

96
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:53,328
Whatever he finds will confirm

97
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,534
that you're a fix-it man
down on your luck.

98
00:04:55,641 --> 00:04:57,076
Stick to that cover.

99
00:04:57,111 --> 00:05:00,551
The Syndicate is always looking
for people with your skills.

100
00:05:00,618 --> 00:05:02,748
Bilby offers you more work,
take it.

101
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:05,193
Get as close to him as possible.

102
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:06,755
Right.

103
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:08,530
O'Brien.

104
00:05:10,006 --> 00:05:12,910
Don't take any more
unnecessary risks.

105
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:15,213
These are dangerous men.

106
00:05:15,251 --> 00:05:19,022
If they find out who you are,
they'll kill you.

107
00:07:34,174 --> 00:07:35,905
- Excuse me, Major. L...
- Major, I'm sorry...

108
00:07:37,115 --> 00:07:38,310
- Go ahead.
- Go ahead.

109
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,343
- There's something...
- I need a...

110
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:42,792
All right.
You first, then you.

111
00:07:42,827 --> 00:07:44,353
Hmm.

112
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:47,131
I need an engineering crew
to run a diagnostic

113
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,163
on the internal
security sensors.

114
00:07:49,207 --> 00:07:52,772
There's been an unusual number
of false alarms lately.

115
00:07:52,816 --> 00:07:54,581
I'll have someone
take a look at it

116
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,645
as soon as possible.

117
00:07:55,689 --> 00:07:57,090
Now, Quark.

118
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,252
There's something's wrong

119
00:07:58,294 --> 00:08:00,287
with the fire-suppression
system in the bar.

120
00:08:00,332 --> 00:08:02,963
Every time
I serve a flaming cocktail

121
00:08:03,005 --> 00:08:04,702
the system engages
and snuffs it out.

122
00:08:04,742 --> 00:08:05,903
I'll put it on the list.

123
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,003
Please do.

124
00:08:07,047 --> 00:08:09,314
You have no idea what people
are willing to pay

125
00:08:09,352 --> 00:08:10,821
for a glass of burning alcohol.

126
00:08:10,855 --> 00:08:11,982
Excuse me.

127
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:12,754
Major...

128
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:13,761
Oh, let me guess.

129
00:08:13,795 --> 00:08:15,925
There's a malfunction
in the Infirmary.

130
00:08:15,966 --> 00:08:16,956
How did you know?

131
00:08:22,715 --> 00:08:26,177
Major, there is something wrong
with the turbolift.

132
00:08:26,223 --> 00:08:27,852
I can see that.

133
00:08:27,893 --> 00:08:30,957
We seem to be having
a lot of system glitches.

134
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:33,368
Happens every time
Chief O'Brien goes away.

135
00:08:33,404 --> 00:08:34,964
I do not understand
why his staff

136
00:08:35,008 --> 00:08:37,275
cannot keep the station running
in his absence.

137
00:08:37,313 --> 00:08:39,283
Must have left
my idiot brother in charge.

138
00:08:39,317 --> 00:08:41,982
The engineering crew is doing
the best they can.

139
00:08:42,024 --> 00:08:44,257
The problem is,
no one knows how the Chief

140
00:08:44,295 --> 00:08:47,028
keeps all this Federation
and Cardassian technology

141
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,036
working together.

142
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,937
We've got to do something.

143
00:08:49,974 --> 00:08:51,375
This can't go on.

144
00:08:53,817 --> 00:08:57,052
Sorry, I can't discuss
the Chief's whereabouts.

145
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,151
I understand that, sir, but...

146
00:08:59,195 --> 00:09:01,222
it's getting ridiculous,
isn't it?

147
00:09:01,266 --> 00:09:02,963
How much longer are
we supposed to put up

148
00:09:03,003 --> 00:09:04,028
with these malfunctions?

149
00:09:04,072 --> 00:09:05,974
You know,
I wouldn't be surprised

150
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:08,810
if Major Kira or Commander Worf
came in here demanding answers

151
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:09,818
but you?

152
00:09:09,852 --> 00:09:11,151
It's not your style.

153
00:09:11,188 --> 00:09:12,247
Apparently, it is.

154
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,315
Here I am.

155
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:15,956
I'm not buying it, Doctor.

156
00:09:15,998 --> 00:09:17,695
You didn't come
in here to complain.

157
00:09:17,735 --> 00:09:19,968
You came here because you are
worried about your friend

158
00:09:20,007 --> 00:09:22,501
and you want me to set
your mind at ease.

159
00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:24,048
I wish I could.

160
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:27,056
But, if it helps,
I will tell you this.

161
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,525
The Chief can take
care of himself

162
00:09:28,592 --> 00:09:30,562
as well as anyone I know.

163
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:33,464
You're right about that, sir.

164
00:09:33,503 --> 00:09:36,100
You're right about that.

165
00:09:58,693 --> 00:10:00,526
Did you fix it?

166
00:10:08,648 --> 00:10:10,140
Any feedback?

167
00:10:10,184 --> 00:10:11,983
Feedback gives him a headache.

168
00:10:12,022 --> 00:10:14,186
No, there's no feedback.

169
00:10:14,226 --> 00:10:17,027
Well, we'll see, won't we?

170
00:10:22,177 --> 00:10:23,145
I told you.

171
00:10:25,885 --> 00:10:27,650
Very impressive.

172
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:34,369
You know, if I was
a suspicious man

173
00:10:34,404 --> 00:10:37,240
I might ask myself
how a tinkerer living

174
00:10:37,277 --> 00:10:39,510
in one room on Jinami Street

175
00:10:39,549 --> 00:10:42,681
managed to fix
such a complicated piece

176
00:10:42,722 --> 00:10:44,351
of hardware so quickly.

177
00:10:44,392 --> 00:10:46,829
Good question.

178
00:10:46,864 --> 00:10:49,131
How do you know where I live?

179
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,403
I know a lot about you...

180
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,107
maybe more than you want me to.

181
00:10:54,147 --> 00:10:55,582
Come with me.

182
00:10:56,586 --> 00:10:58,522
Where are we going?

183
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:01,726
For a walk.

184
00:11:23,678 --> 00:11:24,703
Have a seat.

185
00:11:24,748 --> 00:11:25,875
Not there.

186
00:11:25,917 --> 00:11:28,890
Chester doesn't like
people sitting in his chair.

187
00:11:31,228 --> 00:11:33,426
Don't touch anything.

188
00:11:48,466 --> 00:11:49,799
Something wrong?

189
00:11:51,005 --> 00:11:52,998
You tell me.

190
00:11:53,044 --> 00:11:55,311
Did you think I brought you here
to kill you?

191
00:11:58,055 --> 00:12:00,788
Why would I kill someone
that can fix things for me?

192
00:12:02,497 --> 00:12:04,695
I guess a man
that's been knocked around

193
00:12:04,736 --> 00:12:07,732
as much as you have is always
expecting the worst, huh?

194
00:12:07,842 --> 00:12:11,213
Well, I've pretty much
had to get used to the idea

195
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,377
that I've got bad luck.

196
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:15,483
Yeah, that was
a tough break on Dayos IV.

197
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:18,225
Two years for dealing
in stolen goods?

198
00:12:18,266 --> 00:12:20,931
Well, I didn't know
they were stolen.

199
00:12:20,971 --> 00:12:24,035
I guess I should have asked
the guy I bought them from, huh?

200
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:26,105
Who's to say
he'd have told you the truth?

201
00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:27,482
Take this, for example.

202
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,320
My employer asked me to get him
three Klingon disruptors.

203
00:12:30,358 --> 00:12:32,625
Did the man I bought them from
tell me they didn't work?

204
00:12:32,664 --> 00:12:34,156
No, he did not.

205
00:12:35,202 --> 00:12:37,172
Have a look.

206
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:42,942
Ah...

207
00:12:42,986 --> 00:12:45,514
The induction coil
is burned out.

208
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:47,085
Can you fix it?

209
00:12:47,128 --> 00:12:49,189
Sure.

210
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:50,827
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

211
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,034
It's going to make my employer
very happy.

212
00:12:54,044 --> 00:12:57,415
What does he want
with Klingon disruptors?

213
00:12:57,452 --> 00:12:58,579
I didn't ask him.

214
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,283
When Raimus tells
you to do something

215
00:13:00,324 --> 00:13:02,123
you just do it.

216
00:13:02,161 --> 00:13:03,186
You hungry?

217
00:13:03,231 --> 00:13:04,392
A little.

218
00:13:05,837 --> 00:13:07,636
Have some cake.

219
00:13:07,674 --> 00:13:09,644
My wife sent it.

220
00:13:09,678 --> 00:13:10,771
No, thanks.

221
00:13:10,814 --> 00:13:11,645
Go ahead.

222
00:13:24,144 --> 00:13:25,169
It's good.

223
00:13:25,212 --> 00:13:27,182
Yeah, she makes it herself.

224
00:13:27,216 --> 00:13:30,383
This is her.

225
00:13:30,424 --> 00:13:32,121
These are my children.

226
00:13:32,161 --> 00:13:33,186
Oh...

227
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,529
great.

228
00:13:34,566 --> 00:13:35,865
Where are they?

229
00:13:35,936 --> 00:13:38,237
They're in New Sydney.

230
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,439
I'd love to have them
here on Farius

231
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:44,716
but, uh, considering
the business I'm in

232
00:13:44,756 --> 00:13:46,521
it's not a good idea.

233
00:13:47,929 --> 00:13:49,694
You got a family?

234
00:13:49,732 --> 00:13:50,700
No.

235
00:13:50,735 --> 00:13:51,703
You should.

236
00:13:51,737 --> 00:13:54,300
It's the most important thing.

237
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,315
I send them everything.

238
00:13:58,352 --> 00:13:59,912
I pay my fare to Raimus.

239
00:13:59,956 --> 00:14:01,892
The rest goes straight
to my wife.

240
00:14:04,398 --> 00:14:05,867
Your fare?

241
00:14:05,902 --> 00:14:07,633
Yeah, to Raimus every month.

242
00:14:07,672 --> 00:14:09,403
That's the way it works.

243
00:14:09,443 --> 00:14:11,573
He's above me
in the organization.

244
00:14:13,585 --> 00:14:17,150
You do know what organization
I'm referring to, don't you?

245
00:14:17,193 --> 00:14:18,161
I think so.

246
00:14:18,196 --> 00:14:19,722
Good.

247
00:14:19,765 --> 00:14:22,761
Krole and Flith,
the gentlemen you met earlier?

248
00:14:22,805 --> 00:14:24,000
They're below me.

249
00:14:25,044 --> 00:14:26,570
Lucky them.

250
00:14:26,614 --> 00:14:27,809
If you fix

251
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:30,789
these disruptors for me,
you could be lucky, too.

252
00:14:30,823 --> 00:14:31,848
That's good to know.

253
00:14:31,892 --> 00:14:32,917
Don't misunderstand me.

254
00:14:32,994 --> 00:14:34,725
I'm not promising you anything.

255
00:14:34,765 --> 00:14:37,134
I just need to be sure
that I can trust you first.

256
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:41,479
Have some more cake.

257
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:44,342
No, thanks.

258
00:14:44,386 --> 00:14:45,946
I thought you said
you were hungry.

259
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,185
Oh... I'm all right.

260
00:14:47,225 --> 00:14:48,318
What's the matter?

261
00:14:48,362 --> 00:14:50,127
Don't you like my wife's cake?

262
00:14:51,168 --> 00:14:52,660
Oh, I didn't say that.

263
00:14:52,705 --> 00:14:54,140
So, answer me.

264
00:14:54,175 --> 00:14:56,373
Do you like my wife's cake?

265
00:14:58,417 --> 00:15:00,011
To tell you the truth,
it's, uh...

266
00:15:01,223 --> 00:15:02,988
it's a little dry.

267
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,722
You're right, it is.

268
00:15:07,571 --> 00:15:10,544
Had you wondering
which way to jump, didn't I?

269
00:15:12,415 --> 00:15:13,748
You know, Krole and Flith...

270
00:15:13,784 --> 00:15:16,723
they always act as if it's
the best thing they ever tasted.

271
00:15:16,758 --> 00:15:18,751
Whoo.

272
00:15:18,795 --> 00:15:20,959
Hey, what do you make
of that, Chester?

273
00:15:21,067 --> 00:15:24,370
I've found me an honest man.

274
00:15:24,408 --> 00:15:26,811
Must be my lucky day.

275
00:15:32,859 --> 00:15:34,989
The induction coils
you asked for...

276
00:15:35,098 --> 00:15:38,538
courtesy of the Klingon
Ambassador to Farius.

277
00:15:40,911 --> 00:15:42,778
There's a Klingon Ambassador
here?

278
00:15:42,815 --> 00:15:44,979
Gowron mustn't
like him too much.

279
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:48,653
Do you have any idea why Raimus
wants these disruptors?

280
00:15:48,694 --> 00:15:49,993
No.

281
00:15:50,031 --> 00:15:52,366
Bilby doesn't even know.

282
00:15:54,307 --> 00:15:56,471
Listen, is there, uh...

283
00:15:56,511 --> 00:15:58,846
any way
I could talk to my wife

284
00:15:58,883 --> 00:16:01,218
and let her know I'm all right?

285
00:16:01,255 --> 00:16:02,588
We can't risk it.

286
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,994
I'm sorry.

287
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:09,631
Better be going.

288
00:16:23,938 --> 00:16:25,635
Flith...

289
00:16:25,675 --> 00:16:27,873
go stand over there.

290
00:16:27,914 --> 00:16:29,143
Why?

291
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:33,018
I want to see
if he really fixed this.

292
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:34,391
Very funny.

293
00:16:35,397 --> 00:16:36,730
Contact Raimus.

294
00:16:36,767 --> 00:16:39,204
Tell him we have the disruptors.

295
00:16:42,613 --> 00:16:44,583
Good job.

296
00:16:44,617 --> 00:16:46,610
I'm curious about something.

297
00:16:48,124 --> 00:16:50,721
How did you get ahold
of replacement parts?

298
00:16:50,763 --> 00:16:54,032
Klingon technology
isn't easy to come by.

299
00:16:54,071 --> 00:16:55,973
Well, you know, you...

300
00:16:56,009 --> 00:16:59,380
have to know who to go to.

301
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,614
Hmm. Why don't you enlighten us

302
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:04,655
in case we need
to procure something else?

303
00:17:04,787 --> 00:17:05,914
I've got a better idea.

304
00:17:05,957 --> 00:17:08,018
Why don't you stay
out of my business?

305
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:09,690
Tell us where you got the parts.

306
00:17:09,732 --> 00:17:11,395
We can always use
a good contact.

307
00:17:11,435 --> 00:17:12,403
I can't.

308
00:17:12,437 --> 00:17:13,701
Why not?

309
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,178
Well, my supplier would
rather remain anonymous.

310
00:17:16,213 --> 00:17:17,876
I don't care
about your supplier.

311
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,476
I'm asking the question.

312
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,387
I told him I wouldn't.

313
00:17:21,424 --> 00:17:22,916
Where did you get the parts?!

314
00:17:26,034 --> 00:17:27,560
I stole them.

315
00:17:27,605 --> 00:17:29,575
You stole them?

316
00:17:29,642 --> 00:17:30,837
Yeah.

317
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:34,684
From a warehouse on,
uh, Degora Street.

318
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,587
Well, why didn't
you just say so?

319
00:17:36,691 --> 00:17:40,826
Well, I thought it was
better if you didn't know.

320
00:17:40,867 --> 00:17:44,968
You know, in case the
police caught up with me.

321
00:17:45,009 --> 00:17:46,376
You lied to me

322
00:17:46,412 --> 00:17:49,385
because you didn't want me
to be implicated?

323
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:50,444
Yeah.

324
00:17:50,488 --> 00:17:52,219
I'm sorry.

325
00:17:54,397 --> 00:17:55,866
Did you hear that?

326
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,635
He's willing to protect me
if he gets caught.

327
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:03,079
And try hard as I may,
I can't imagine either of you

328
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:05,313
willing to do that.

329
00:18:07,358 --> 00:18:09,089
Hey...

330
00:18:09,128 --> 00:18:10,757
you know something?

331
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,895
I think it's time
we did something

332
00:18:12,937 --> 00:18:14,463
about the way you look.

333
00:18:17,146 --> 00:18:19,947
Now, that's more like it.

334
00:18:19,986 --> 00:18:22,253
I think you look great,
Connelly.

335
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:24,056
What do you think, Krole?

336
00:18:25,398 --> 00:18:27,129
He looks fine.

337
00:18:27,168 --> 00:18:28,603
What are you talking about?

338
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:30,940
I took him to the same
tailor that I use.

339
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:32,310
You look fine, too.

340
00:18:36,422 --> 00:18:38,655
I understand...

341
00:18:38,761 --> 00:18:40,994
you've been looking for me.

342
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,468
That's right.

343
00:18:46,511 --> 00:18:48,982
I take it you're in the market
for something.

344
00:18:49,016 --> 00:18:51,112
Well, if I was,
I wouldn't buy anything

345
00:18:51,155 --> 00:18:53,922
from a man that sold me
three useless disruptors.

346
00:18:53,961 --> 00:18:55,487
You know me better than that.

347
00:18:55,531 --> 00:18:57,364
I thought I did.

348
00:18:57,401 --> 00:18:59,337
Those disruptors
were working fine

349
00:18:59,373 --> 00:19:00,774
when I gave them to you.

350
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:04,112
What happened after that,
I don't know.

351
00:19:04,149 --> 00:19:06,780
Perhaps you dropped them.

352
00:19:14,873 --> 00:19:17,140
I want my money back.

353
00:19:20,719 --> 00:19:23,692
You know I can't do that.

354
00:19:23,793 --> 00:19:25,558
You took delivery.

355
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:27,430
Let me get something straight.

356
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:30,702
You're telling me there
was nothing wrong with this

357
00:19:30,741 --> 00:19:32,233
when you sold it to me.

358
00:19:32,278 --> 00:19:33,337
That's correct.

359
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,213
Well, maybe I, uh...

360
00:19:35,252 --> 00:19:38,851
just don't know how to work it.

361
00:19:38,893 --> 00:19:40,088
That must be it.

362
00:19:44,906 --> 00:19:46,739
Well, what do you know?

363
00:19:46,844 --> 00:19:48,404
I figured it out.

364
00:19:48,447 --> 00:19:49,574
Bilby...

365
00:19:49,616 --> 00:19:51,712
Do you know
what would've happened

366
00:19:51,754 --> 00:19:54,624
if I'd given Raimus
three useless disruptors?

367
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:55,960
He'd have killed me.

368
00:19:55,996 --> 00:19:59,401
If you want your money back...
you can have it!

369
00:19:59,438 --> 00:20:02,605
Why would I want my money back?

370
00:20:02,644 --> 00:20:04,238
It works fine now.

371
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:19,677
No one takes me for a fool.

372
00:20:19,716 --> 00:20:22,951
I'll do whatever it takes
to protect what I have.

373
00:20:24,693 --> 00:20:26,823
This life...

374
00:20:26,864 --> 00:20:28,834
it isn't for everyone.

375
00:20:28,903 --> 00:20:32,343
Sometimes I wish I could
just get away from it all.

376
00:20:34,347 --> 00:20:36,750
But what would I do with myself?

377
00:20:38,256 --> 00:20:40,317
I'm too old to start over.

378
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,860
Besides, who am I to complain?

379
00:20:43,969 --> 00:20:45,700
The organization's
given me opportunities

380
00:20:45,739 --> 00:20:47,072
I never thought I would have.

381
00:20:48,412 --> 00:20:50,405
Once you're part of it...

382
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,717
once you're accepted...

383
00:20:52,755 --> 00:20:55,318
there's no limit
to what you can do

384
00:20:55,361 --> 00:20:57,457
if you're smart about it.

385
00:20:58,635 --> 00:21:00,537
Smart and careful.

386
00:21:00,572 --> 00:21:03,009
Glad you're paying attention.

387
00:21:03,044 --> 00:21:05,071
I mean, we got people
everywhere...

388
00:21:05,115 --> 00:21:06,516
even on Earth.

389
00:21:06,552 --> 00:21:09,548
Hell, we've even got a man
in Starfleet.

390
00:21:10,961 --> 00:21:13,228
Come on... Starfleet?

391
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:15,396
That's correct.

392
00:21:15,438 --> 00:21:17,101
Hey, would you do me a favor?

393
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:18,201
Would you remind me

394
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:20,442
to pick up a present
for my daughter tomorrow?

395
00:21:20,483 --> 00:21:23,011
She's got a birthday coming up.

396
00:21:23,055 --> 00:21:24,649
Sure thing.

397
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:28,158
Oh, I want to be there.

398
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:30,534
Sure hope I can make it.

399
00:21:31,975 --> 00:21:34,469
How did you get
to someone in Starfleet?

400
00:21:34,514 --> 00:21:35,709
It wasn't me.

401
00:21:35,749 --> 00:21:37,048
It was Raimus.

402
00:21:37,086 --> 00:21:38,919
Hey...

403
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:42,020
do you want to come
to New Sydney with me

404
00:21:42,064 --> 00:21:43,363
meet my family?

405
00:21:43,399 --> 00:21:46,531
Well, if you go, yeah.

406
00:21:46,573 --> 00:21:48,167
How'd he do it?

407
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,943
What's with all the questions?

408
00:21:51,016 --> 00:21:52,485
Nothing. Uh...

409
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,615
I just find it hard to believe

410
00:21:54,658 --> 00:21:57,654
that someone in Starfleet
could be bought.

411
00:21:57,697 --> 00:22:00,430
Makes me wonder
if... he's a double agent.

412
00:22:00,471 --> 00:22:01,700
A double agent?

413
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,573
Well, why would he have
given us the names

414
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:05,409
of all their
undercover operatives?

415
00:22:06,417 --> 00:22:08,080
Don't worry.

416
00:22:08,121 --> 00:22:09,681
He's the real thing.

417
00:22:09,724 --> 00:22:13,597
Raimus met him when he was
vacationing on Risa last year.

418
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:17,299
Mr. Starfleet was in charge
of the weather-control system.

419
00:22:17,341 --> 00:22:18,640
Raimus offered him

420
00:22:18,676 --> 00:22:20,874
a very substantial
amount of money

421
00:22:20,915 --> 00:22:22,441
to make it stop raining.

422
00:22:24,824 --> 00:22:28,093
Well, everyone has
their price, I guess.

423
00:22:36,983 --> 00:22:38,316
It's Krole.

424
00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:43,696
Raimus wants to see me.

425
00:22:43,732 --> 00:22:45,668
What, in the middle
of the night?

426
00:22:47,005 --> 00:22:48,304
Hmm...

427
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:09,345
Bilby.

428
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,982
Raimus.

429
00:23:11,092 --> 00:23:13,461
I brought someone
here to meet you.

430
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:23,013
I hope I didn't get
you gentlemen out of bed.

431
00:23:23,085 --> 00:23:24,714
Bilby...

432
00:23:24,756 --> 00:23:26,954
who is this?

433
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,065
He's someone I know.

434
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:33,540
I've never seen him before.

435
00:23:33,575 --> 00:23:35,910
How well do you know him?

436
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:38,384
I know him.

437
00:23:41,258 --> 00:23:42,750
Then it's settled.

438
00:23:42,795 --> 00:23:46,793
Is that the extent of your
security precautions?

439
00:23:46,837 --> 00:23:48,272
Bilby witnessed for him.

440
00:23:48,307 --> 00:23:50,243
That's all that's necessary.

441
00:23:53,285 --> 00:23:54,982
If you say so.

442
00:23:57,728 --> 00:23:59,926
So...

443
00:23:59,966 --> 00:24:02,267
this is Bilby.

444
00:24:02,305 --> 00:24:04,606
He seems capable enough.

445
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,044
I told you.

446
00:24:07,516 --> 00:24:09,953
I wanted to see for myself.

447
00:24:13,596 --> 00:24:15,726
You procured
the disruptors for us?

448
00:24:15,768 --> 00:24:17,499
That's right.

449
00:24:17,538 --> 00:24:21,273
We're going to ask you
to do something else...

450
00:24:21,312 --> 00:24:23,875
something very important.

451
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,482
You can count on me.

452
00:24:26,525 --> 00:24:28,256
I hope so.

453
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:32,964
We'll contact you
when it's time.

454
00:24:38,317 --> 00:24:40,344
Don't let me down.

455
00:24:40,388 --> 00:24:42,017
I won't.

456
00:24:42,058 --> 00:24:43,219
Raimus...

457
00:24:45,332 --> 00:24:47,769
My love to your family.

458
00:25:06,813 --> 00:25:09,786
Do you know
what I just did for you?

459
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,119
I think so.

460
00:25:11,156 --> 00:25:12,819
I witnessed for you.

461
00:25:14,396 --> 00:25:16,492
If anything happens...

462
00:25:16,535 --> 00:25:18,870
I'm accountable.

463
00:25:18,907 --> 00:25:20,342
I understand.

464
00:25:22,013 --> 00:25:23,642
Good.

465
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,394
Nice suit.

466
00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:46,194
Bilby got it for me.

467
00:25:46,266 --> 00:25:47,599
That was generous.

468
00:25:47,636 --> 00:25:49,469
He's like that.

469
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:52,376
I found out who the informer is.

470
00:25:52,413 --> 00:25:54,884
Bilby told me he was in charge

471
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:57,015
of the weather-control
system on Risa

472
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:58,183
about a year ago.

473
00:25:58,226 --> 00:26:00,959
It should be easy enough
to figure out who that was.

474
00:26:00,999 --> 00:26:02,160
Yeah.

475
00:26:04,941 --> 00:26:06,376
Is something wrong?

476
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:11,983
Raimus brought somebody
to meet Bilby.

477
00:26:12,023 --> 00:26:13,116
A Vorta.

478
00:26:16,198 --> 00:26:17,565
You're telling me

479
00:26:17,602 --> 00:26:21,407
that the Orion Syndicate
is working for the Dominion?

480
00:26:21,443 --> 00:26:23,676
Opens up a lot of
possibilities, doesn't it?

481
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:25,811
None of them very pleasant.

482
00:26:27,022 --> 00:26:29,220
So, do I get to go home now?

483
00:26:29,261 --> 00:26:31,459
Not until you find out
what's going on.

484
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:36,466
I was afraid
you were going to say that.

485
00:26:43,124 --> 00:26:44,923
All right.

486
00:26:44,962 --> 00:26:47,263
I've accessed
the bank's data files.

487
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,931
I'm reading a three-tier
security protocol.

488
00:26:49,973 --> 00:26:52,034
I see it.

489
00:26:53,214 --> 00:26:55,275
It looks like
an isolation matrix

490
00:26:55,351 --> 00:26:56,546
is protecting the data.

491
00:26:56,588 --> 00:26:58,752
You'll have to bypass
the encryption lockouts.

492
00:26:58,792 --> 00:27:01,127
You make it sound so easy.

493
00:27:01,164 --> 00:27:02,755
Watch out
for recursive dataloops.

494
00:27:02,888 --> 00:27:04,551
You don't want to get
diverted into a backflow.

495
00:27:06,429 --> 00:27:08,296
I'm past the lockouts.

496
00:27:08,334 --> 00:27:09,302
Sweep the matrix.

497
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,306
Give me an access point.

498
00:27:12,309 --> 00:27:13,608
Stand by.

499
00:27:16,652 --> 00:27:18,212
Go!

500
00:27:19,658 --> 00:27:22,129
Initiating data transfer.

501
00:27:22,164 --> 00:27:23,463
Faster.

502
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,764
I'm trying.

503
00:27:24,803 --> 00:27:26,796
I can't hold the matrix
open much longer.

504
00:27:26,841 --> 00:27:27,570
Hurry!

505
00:27:28,612 --> 00:27:29,739
Got it!

506
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,545
Get us out, Krole.

507
00:27:32,821 --> 00:27:34,290
Faster. They're tracing you.

508
00:27:34,324 --> 00:27:35,793
The lockouts are closing.

509
00:27:35,828 --> 00:27:36,488
Move!

510
00:27:36,528 --> 00:27:37,257
Come on!

511
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:43,810
I'm out.

512
00:27:44,847 --> 00:27:46,476
We did it.

513
00:27:46,517 --> 00:27:48,487
Gentlemen...

514
00:27:48,522 --> 00:27:52,861
we just robbed
the Bank of Bolias.

515
00:27:52,898 --> 00:27:55,529
I was thinking
about opening an account there.

516
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,199
Maybe you should go
with a different bank.

517
00:27:57,241 --> 00:27:59,474
One with better security.

518
00:28:03,355 --> 00:28:05,086
What do you think?

519
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:06,924
Very nice but, uh...

520
00:28:06,963 --> 00:28:07,931
But what?

521
00:28:07,965 --> 00:28:09,194
I-I don't want to, you know...

522
00:28:09,234 --> 00:28:10,931
What do you mean,
you don't want to?

523
00:28:10,972 --> 00:28:12,942
I brought her here for you.

524
00:28:12,976 --> 00:28:14,205
I appreciate that, but...

525
00:28:14,245 --> 00:28:15,714
But what?

526
00:28:18,288 --> 00:28:20,589
Don't tell me
you don't like girls.

527
00:28:21,895 --> 00:28:23,455
I have a girlfriend.

528
00:28:23,499 --> 00:28:25,059
Since when?

529
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:27,336
A-a few days...

530
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:29,367
a week... I don't know.

531
00:28:29,412 --> 00:28:30,380
That's great.

532
00:28:30,414 --> 00:28:31,974
Why didn't you say anything?

533
00:28:32,018 --> 00:28:33,111
I don't know.

534
00:28:33,153 --> 00:28:34,713
It didn't come up.

535
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,232
Listen, I understand

536
00:28:41,271 --> 00:28:44,938
uh, but that's no reason
to hurt this girl's feelings.

537
00:28:52,863 --> 00:28:57,670
Um... we've got some
business to discuss

538
00:28:57,707 --> 00:28:59,574
so, uh, why don't you...

539
00:28:59,611 --> 00:29:01,410
go on ahead home and...

540
00:29:02,718 --> 00:29:05,519
...l'll call you
in a couple of days, okay?

541
00:29:08,364 --> 00:29:10,197
And thanks for coming over.

542
00:29:10,235 --> 00:29:11,761
It was really nice to meet you.

543
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,422
So who is she?

544
00:29:20,457 --> 00:29:21,756
This new girl.

545
00:29:21,794 --> 00:29:24,858
Oh, her name's... Kimiko.

546
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,893
Where'd you meet her?

547
00:29:26,938 --> 00:29:28,430
She works in a flower shop...

548
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,774
arranging flowers.

549
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:31,337
Well, bring her by sometime.

550
00:29:31,381 --> 00:29:32,645
I'd like to meet her.

551
00:29:32,684 --> 00:29:33,652
Yeah, I will.

552
00:29:33,686 --> 00:29:34,985
A man your age

553
00:29:35,022 --> 00:29:37,220
you should settle down
and have a family.

554
00:29:37,261 --> 00:29:38,890
It's the most important thing.

555
00:29:38,931 --> 00:29:41,402
I don't know
if it's that serious yet.

556
00:29:41,436 --> 00:29:43,805
Well, you let me talk
to her for three minutes.

557
00:29:43,842 --> 00:29:46,075
I'll let you know if
she's the marrying kind.

558
00:29:46,181 --> 00:29:47,673
I can read people right away...

559
00:29:47,717 --> 00:29:49,084
what's in their hearts.

560
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:50,816
You, for instance.

561
00:29:50,857 --> 00:29:53,624
I saw through you the first
time I laid eyes on you.

562
00:29:53,664 --> 00:29:54,632
Oh, yeah?

563
00:29:54,666 --> 00:29:55,827
I don't think

564
00:29:55,868 --> 00:29:58,841
I've ever seen anyone
so alone in my entire life.

565
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:00,310
I said to myself

566
00:30:00,345 --> 00:30:03,682
"That man, he doesn't have
a friend in the Quadrant."

567
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:06,122
Flith and Krole...

568
00:30:06,225 --> 00:30:08,355
they thought you were a snake.

569
00:30:08,395 --> 00:30:09,796
Really?

570
00:30:11,236 --> 00:30:13,138
But I knew better.

571
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,543
When you came back that next day
with the dataport repaired

572
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,879
that's when I knew

573
00:30:17,917 --> 00:30:20,150
we're going to do
great things together.

574
00:30:20,189 --> 00:30:23,560
I'm about to take a step up
in the organization.

575
00:30:23,596 --> 00:30:25,259
Raimus is giving me
an opportunity

576
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,167
and I'm going
to make the best of it.

577
00:30:27,204 --> 00:30:28,730
Everything's changing.

578
00:30:28,774 --> 00:30:30,107
I can feel it.

579
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:32,672
And it all started
when you came along.

580
00:30:32,716 --> 00:30:34,015
You changed my luck.

581
00:30:34,052 --> 00:30:35,919
I thought you'd changed mine.

582
00:30:35,957 --> 00:30:38,588
I'm going to take care of you.

583
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:40,565
I don't forget my friends

584
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,197
'cause friends...

585
00:30:43,272 --> 00:30:45,208
they're like family

586
00:30:45,311 --> 00:30:47,441
and nothing's more important.

587
00:30:47,481 --> 00:30:49,280
Nothing.

588
00:31:04,051 --> 00:31:05,178
You're late.

589
00:31:05,288 --> 00:31:06,278
I was beginning to worry.

590
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:07,518
Sorry.

591
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:08,527
That's all right.

592
00:31:08,562 --> 00:31:10,464
I imagine the Dominion
is keeping you busy.

593
00:31:10,499 --> 00:31:11,968
No, nothing's
happened with that yet.

594
00:31:12,002 --> 00:31:13,403
I was just doing
something with Bilby.

595
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:14,805
Anything worth reporting?

596
00:31:14,842 --> 00:31:16,311
We went to the races.

597
00:31:16,345 --> 00:31:18,646
We came out ahead.

598
00:31:18,684 --> 00:31:21,451
I'm glad to hear that you're
enjoying your assignment.

599
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:22,857
Well, you told me
to get close to him.

600
00:31:22,893 --> 00:31:24,226
He said he wanted to go;
I went with him.

601
00:31:24,329 --> 00:31:25,558
There's no need to explain.

602
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:26,589
I've been undercover.

603
00:31:28,438 --> 00:31:30,032
Bilby's witnessed for me.

604
00:31:30,075 --> 00:31:32,808
Sounds like you've really
got your hooks into him.

605
00:31:34,619 --> 00:31:36,852
What's going to happen to him
when you pull me out?

606
00:31:36,891 --> 00:31:38,987
That's nothing that you need
to think about.

607
00:31:39,028 --> 00:31:40,725
They're going to kill him,
aren't they?

608
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:44,706
Listen, Bilby chose this life.

609
00:31:44,741 --> 00:31:47,178
Whatever happens to him
is his fault

610
00:31:47,213 --> 00:31:48,773
not yours.

611
00:31:48,817 --> 00:31:51,288
Besides, if he's lucky,
we'll get to him

612
00:31:51,322 --> 00:31:52,586
before they do.

613
00:31:52,624 --> 00:31:54,685
He'll be safe
in a Federation prison.

614
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:57,702
Just help us build a good case
against him.

615
00:31:59,974 --> 00:32:01,067
Right.

616
00:32:28,136 --> 00:32:30,129
Good morning, Graife.

617
00:32:32,178 --> 00:32:33,442
Raimus.

618
00:32:33,481 --> 00:32:34,848
I didn't know you were coming.

619
00:32:34,884 --> 00:32:36,615
I can see that.

620
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:39,149
Well, let me get you something.

621
00:32:39,193 --> 00:32:41,220
Graife, make us
a strong pot of...

622
00:32:41,265 --> 00:32:43,098
Bilby, not right now.

623
00:32:43,136 --> 00:32:45,437
This isn't a social visit.

624
00:32:46,978 --> 00:32:49,039
Which one is it?

625
00:32:49,082 --> 00:32:52,522
Wait. Don't tell me.

626
00:32:52,556 --> 00:32:55,221
Let me see if I can guess.

627
00:33:00,307 --> 00:33:05,273
They say you can tell a traitor
by looking in his eyes.

628
00:33:05,318 --> 00:33:08,780
Do you think that's true, Bilby?

629
00:33:08,826 --> 00:33:10,352
I wouldn't know.

630
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:15,669
Raimus, what's this all about?

631
00:33:15,707 --> 00:33:16,936
What does it look like?

632
00:33:16,976 --> 00:33:19,777
If you ask me, none of them
look particularly trustworthy.

633
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,755
Raimus...

634
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:26,627
Not now.

635
00:33:26,665 --> 00:33:27,690
But...

636
00:33:27,733 --> 00:33:29,464
I said not now.

637
00:33:41,597 --> 00:33:42,930
Him.

638
00:33:42,967 --> 00:33:46,099
I've been saying so all along!

639
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,335
Raimus, this is crazy.

640
00:33:47,377 --> 00:33:49,575
He doesn't know
what he's talking about.

641
00:33:53,557 --> 00:33:55,994
He was going
to be my second guess.

642
00:33:56,029 --> 00:33:58,262
W-what did he do?

643
00:33:58,301 --> 00:34:00,636
Let's just say he conducted
some business on the side

644
00:34:00,673 --> 00:34:02,040
and neglected to pay his fare.

645
00:34:02,076 --> 00:34:03,705
I see.

646
00:34:03,747 --> 00:34:04,806
It's a good thing

647
00:34:04,849 --> 00:34:06,148
you never witnessed for him

648
00:34:06,184 --> 00:34:08,280
or you'd be lying there, too,
Bilby.

649
00:34:11,162 --> 00:34:12,289
Yeah.

650
00:34:13,667 --> 00:34:15,694
Well, now that that's
out of the way

651
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:19,042
shall we discuss
the matter at hand?

652
00:34:20,182 --> 00:34:23,644
We mentioned we might ask you
to do something for us.

653
00:34:23,689 --> 00:34:24,748
Yeah, whatever you need.

654
00:34:24,793 --> 00:34:25,920
Mmm. So accommodating.

655
00:34:25,961 --> 00:34:27,828
He reminds me of a Jem'Hadar.

656
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:30,063
We want you to assassinate

657
00:34:30,104 --> 00:34:32,837
the Klingon Ambassador
to Farius.

658
00:34:32,876 --> 00:34:34,071
- All right.
- And you'll

659
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:37,280
use the disruptors you procured
earlier.

660
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,725
You want it to look like he was
killed by a rival House.

661
00:34:40,761 --> 00:34:41,421
Connelly!

662
00:34:42,498 --> 00:34:43,865
It's all right.

663
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:47,106
Very astute.

664
00:34:47,142 --> 00:34:51,208
Do you know much about
political affairs?

665
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,479
Not really.

666
00:34:52,587 --> 00:34:55,719
Well, then, allow me
to enlighten you.

667
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,858
The Ambassador has been
advocating that the Klingons

668
00:34:58,901 --> 00:35:01,532
break off their alliance
with the Federation

669
00:35:01,573 --> 00:35:05,446
and concentrate on defending
the Empire against the Dominion.

670
00:35:05,549 --> 00:35:07,451
Chancellor Gowron,
on the other hand

671
00:35:07,553 --> 00:35:10,617
is adamantly committed
to the Alliance.

672
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,959
You're going to making it look

673
00:35:11,996 --> 00:35:13,932
like Gowron ordered
the assassination.

674
00:35:13,967 --> 00:35:15,128
Exactly.

675
00:35:15,169 --> 00:35:17,868
The Ambassador will be seen
as a martyr

676
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:20,210
and his cause
will gain strength.

677
00:35:20,247 --> 00:35:21,841
If all goes well

678
00:35:21,884 --> 00:35:25,016
the Klingons will retreat
into their own territory

679
00:35:25,058 --> 00:35:26,584
and then,
all we'll have to deal with

680
00:35:26,628 --> 00:35:28,963
is the Federation.

681
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,164
Makes sense.

682
00:35:31,204 --> 00:35:33,835
I'm glad you think so.

683
00:35:33,878 --> 00:35:37,683
Needless to say,
it is very important

684
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:42,685
that the Dominion's part in this
remain secret.

685
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:47,764
If something goes wrong
and you're captured...

686
00:35:47,808 --> 00:35:50,041
you never met our friend here.

687
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,347
I understand.

688
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:56,618
I knew I could count on you.

689
00:35:58,465 --> 00:36:00,959
I never realized
how much the Dominion

690
00:36:01,004 --> 00:36:03,168
and the Orion Syndicate
have in common.

691
00:36:03,209 --> 00:36:06,944
It seems
that in both organizations...

692
00:36:06,983 --> 00:36:08,953
Loyalty is everything.

693
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:12,320
How are they planning

694
00:36:12,362 --> 00:36:14,264
to get past
the Embassy's security?

695
00:36:14,299 --> 00:36:15,928
Bilby asked me the same thing.

696
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:18,533
I figured out a way
to interrupt the power grid

697
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:19,542
for a few seconds.

698
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:21,740
Bilby and his men
will be able to beam in

699
00:36:21,783 --> 00:36:23,753
before the backup
generator kicks in.

700
00:36:23,787 --> 00:36:25,381
When is this supposed to happen?

701
00:36:25,424 --> 00:36:26,551
Tonight.

702
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:29,530
I'll contact the Klingons,
so they can be ready for them.

703
00:36:29,566 --> 00:36:31,001
What are you talking about?

704
00:36:31,036 --> 00:36:33,872
If the Klingons get their hands
on Bilby and his men

705
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:34,935
they'll kill them.

706
00:36:34,978 --> 00:36:36,709
That's not really our business,
is it?

707
00:36:36,749 --> 00:36:38,582
You're setting them up
to be murdered?

708
00:36:38,653 --> 00:36:40,213
You have things backwards.

709
00:36:40,256 --> 00:36:42,249
Bilby and his friends
are the ones

710
00:36:42,295 --> 00:36:43,889
that murder people, not us.

711
00:36:45,034 --> 00:36:47,095
We just get Klingons
to do it for us.

712
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:48,573
All I'm doing is following

713
00:36:48,608 --> 00:36:50,407
procedures
and warning our allies

714
00:36:50,445 --> 00:36:52,541
about a possible
assassination attempt.

715
00:36:52,584 --> 00:36:54,817
What happens after that
is not my concern

716
00:36:54,856 --> 00:36:57,293
but believe me,
if the Klingons go after Raimus

717
00:36:57,328 --> 00:36:59,127
and the rest
of the Orion Syndicate

718
00:36:59,165 --> 00:36:59,781
I won't shed any tears.

719
00:36:59,914 --> 00:37:01,440
I'm sure you won't.

720
00:37:01,484 --> 00:37:03,580
Miles...

721
00:37:05,292 --> 00:37:07,125
listen to me.

722
00:37:08,633 --> 00:37:10,603
You've lost perspective.

723
00:37:10,638 --> 00:37:15,411
You're starting to sympathize
with these people.

724
00:37:15,448 --> 00:37:17,783
It's good
that we're pulling you out.

725
00:37:17,853 --> 00:37:19,949
Pulling me out?

726
00:37:19,992 --> 00:37:23,056
We're putting you
on the next transport home.

727
00:37:23,098 --> 00:37:24,727
Your assignment's over.

728
00:37:24,768 --> 00:37:28,539
You told me we were going
to make a case against Bilby.

729
00:37:28,577 --> 00:37:30,946
You told me
he was going to prison!

730
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:31,950
I'm sorry.

731
00:37:31,984 --> 00:37:33,283
I didn't want to mislead you

732
00:37:33,321 --> 00:37:34,813
but you were starting to waver.

733
00:37:34,858 --> 00:37:36,988
I needed to keep you on track.

734
00:37:42,173 --> 00:37:44,200
Come on.

735
00:37:44,245 --> 00:37:45,771
Let's get you home.

736
00:37:45,815 --> 00:37:47,079
Chadwick.

737
00:37:55,536 --> 00:37:57,472
There you go, Chester.

738
00:38:09,935 --> 00:38:11,928
Who could that be?

739
00:38:15,179 --> 00:38:16,705
Did you come to see me off?

740
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,185
We need to talk.

741
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,279
Have to wait.

742
00:38:19,322 --> 00:38:20,621
I was just leaving.

743
00:38:20,657 --> 00:38:21,625
You can't go.

744
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,357
What are you talking about?

745
00:38:23,398 --> 00:38:24,457
Look, just

746
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,333
trust me.

747
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,135
You can't go.

748
00:38:28,174 --> 00:38:29,473
Why not?

749
00:38:29,511 --> 00:38:31,709
It's a trap.

750
00:38:37,762 --> 00:38:38,889
Listen to me!

751
00:38:38,998 --> 00:38:40,900
The Klingons know
what you're planning to do.

752
00:38:40,969 --> 00:38:42,438
That's impossible.

753
00:38:42,473 --> 00:38:45,708
Someone traced my signal
when I accessed the power grid.

754
00:38:45,747 --> 00:38:47,273
I saw you access the grid.

755
00:38:47,316 --> 00:38:48,580
You cut off the trace.

756
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:50,749
No, they just made me
think I had.

757
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,919
You're panicking.

758
00:38:52,962 --> 00:38:54,932
Try not to worry so much.

759
00:38:54,967 --> 00:38:56,664
You're the one
who should be worried.

760
00:38:56,704 --> 00:38:58,503
Do you have any idea
what the Klingons

761
00:38:58,541 --> 00:39:00,170
will do to you
when they catch you?

762
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:02,045
They're not going to catch me.

763
00:39:02,082 --> 00:39:03,608
Yes, they will.

764
00:39:03,652 --> 00:39:06,488
Starfleet Intelligence
will warn them you're coming.

765
00:39:06,525 --> 00:39:07,493
How do you know that?

766
00:39:07,528 --> 00:39:08,827
I suppose you work for them.

767
00:39:14,243 --> 00:39:16,339
What if I said I did?

768
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:18,418
Very good. You had me.

769
00:39:18,452 --> 00:39:19,853
I mean, just for a minute there

770
00:39:19,888 --> 00:39:22,382
I actually thought that you
were working for Starfleet.

771
00:39:22,427 --> 00:39:24,260
I am.

772
00:39:26,637 --> 00:39:28,197
Come on.

773
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:29,606
That's enough.

774
00:39:29,643 --> 00:39:31,203
You had me. I admit it.

775
00:39:31,246 --> 00:39:33,182
I am working for Starfleet.

776
00:39:33,217 --> 00:39:34,948
That's enough! I said
I don't want to hear that!

777
00:39:35,022 --> 00:39:35,955
Do you understand me?

778
00:39:36,057 --> 00:39:37,356
I don't want to hear that.

779
00:39:42,638 --> 00:39:44,871
Why'd you have to come here?

780
00:39:44,909 --> 00:39:47,608
Why'd you have to tell me that?

781
00:39:47,649 --> 00:39:49,175
I couldn't just let you go.

782
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,917
The Klingons will kill you.

783
00:39:50,957 --> 00:39:52,426
I'm dead already.

784
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,089
Can't you see that?

785
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,565
I witnessed for you.

786
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,003
Do you have any idea
what that means?

787
00:39:58,105 --> 00:39:59,768
What if I get you off Farius?

788
00:39:59,809 --> 00:40:01,574
Find you a place to hide?

789
00:40:01,613 --> 00:40:03,583
There's no hiding
from the Syndicate.

790
00:40:03,618 --> 00:40:04,745
You know that.

791
00:40:04,786 --> 00:40:05,754
Well, then turn yourself in.

792
00:40:05,788 --> 00:40:07,189
You'll be safe in prison.

793
00:40:07,225 --> 00:40:09,161
No! They'd go after my family!

794
00:40:12,403 --> 00:40:13,929
They'd make an example of me.

795
00:40:19,786 --> 00:40:23,659
Raimus may leave them alone
if he thinks that I died

796
00:40:23,695 --> 00:40:25,255
not knowing about you.

797
00:40:25,299 --> 00:40:27,463
But you can't
just let them kill you.

798
00:40:28,606 --> 00:40:30,576
What choice do I have?

799
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:40,091
How did I let this happen?

800
00:40:40,198 --> 00:40:42,601
I should have known.

801
00:40:42,637 --> 00:40:45,404
You were too good to be true.

802
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:49,612
I wanted so much to believe
that my luck had changed

803
00:40:49,652 --> 00:40:51,053
I didn't see it.

804
00:40:52,625 --> 00:40:54,356
I didn't see it.

805
00:40:56,467 --> 00:40:58,198
I never meant
for this to happen.

806
00:41:01,611 --> 00:41:03,809
I wasn't after you.

807
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:06,014
I was just trying to find out

808
00:41:06,055 --> 00:41:09,051
how the Syndicate
compromised Starfleet.

809
00:41:09,094 --> 00:41:11,531
I wasn't even your target.

810
00:41:13,605 --> 00:41:15,735
I suppose
I'm not important enough.

811
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:19,979
I've always known something
like this might happen.

812
00:41:23,192 --> 00:41:25,094
The smart thing would be
to kill you.

813
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:31,040
But I guess I've already
proved...

814
00:41:31,076 --> 00:41:33,274
I'm not too smart.

815
00:41:33,314 --> 00:41:35,478
I'm sorry, Bilby.

816
00:41:36,856 --> 00:41:39,089
You'll never know
how little comfort that is.

817
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,435
If it's not too much trouble

818
00:41:44,473 --> 00:41:47,640
will you make sure
Chester is looked after?

819
00:41:57,902 --> 00:41:59,269
Be good.

820
00:42:11,465 --> 00:42:13,128
Do you mind
if I ask you something?

821
00:42:13,168 --> 00:42:15,469
Back home...
wherever that is...

822
00:42:15,507 --> 00:42:17,637
do you have a family?

823
00:42:19,616 --> 00:42:21,085
Yeah.

824
00:42:23,692 --> 00:42:25,184
Good.

825
00:42:25,262 --> 00:42:28,326
It's the most important thing.

826
00:42:44,605 --> 00:42:46,906
I'll never forget
the look on his face

827
00:42:46,943 --> 00:42:48,606
when he found out
who I really was.

828
00:42:48,647 --> 00:42:50,845
Well, you took an enormous risk
by telling him.

829
00:42:50,884 --> 00:42:52,079
He could have killed you.

830
00:42:52,121 --> 00:42:54,649
I knew he wouldn't.

831
00:42:54,693 --> 00:42:57,028
Well, all I can say
is that you're lucky

832
00:42:57,065 --> 00:43:00,561
that Chadwick decided not
to put everything in his report.

833
00:43:00,606 --> 00:43:05,139
Julian, you don't understand
what I'm trying to tell you.

834
00:43:05,183 --> 00:43:07,518
Bilby trusted me.

835
00:43:07,554 --> 00:43:10,390
He put his life in my hands,
and...

836
00:43:10,428 --> 00:43:12,159
I killed him

837
00:43:12,198 --> 00:43:14,225
just as surely as if I'd
pulled that trigger myself.

838
00:43:14,302 --> 00:43:17,400
That's not fair,
and you know it.

839
00:43:17,443 --> 00:43:21,110
You did what you had to do...
your duty.

840
00:43:21,152 --> 00:43:23,282
Is that what I'm supposed
to tell myself?

841
00:43:25,528 --> 00:43:27,395
It is the truth.

842
00:43:31,841 --> 00:43:34,278
Look, I'm sorry that I don't
have all the answers.

843
00:43:34,346 --> 00:43:37,147
All I know for sure

844
00:43:37,187 --> 00:43:38,850
is that I'm glad you're back.
