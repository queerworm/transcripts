00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:06,590
SISKO:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 49263.5.</i>

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,926
<i>At the request of</i>
<i>the Karemma Commerce Ministry,</i>

3
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:10,594
<i>we've brought the</i> Defiant

4
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:12,554
<i>to a remote system</i>
<i>in the Gamma Quadrant</i>

5
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,598
<i>to discuss problems</i>
<i>that have surfaced</i>

6
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,809
<i>regarding</i>
<i>our recent trade agreement.</i>

7
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:20,270
When we first agreed to use
Ferengi as intermediaries,

8
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,648
we did it because
we knew the Dominion

9
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:24,608
would never tolerate
direct trade

10
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,276
between us
and the Federation.

11
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,111
And we're glad
to be of service,

12
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,447
and I'm happy to say that
not a single Ferengi vessel

13
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,783
has been stopped
by the Jem'Hadar.

14
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:34,493
Unfortunately,
we have found

15
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:36,286
there is very
little profit

16
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,664
in doing business
with the Federation.

17
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:41,583
In order to comply with
all your commerce laws,

18
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,461
we have had to pay
a series of taxes and fees

19
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,672
that have made
the costs too high.

20
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:48,841
SISKO:
What sort
of taxes and fees

21
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:50,175
are you referring to?

22
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,510
For example,

23
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,221
on a recent shipment
of Karemman fleece,

24
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,557
a four percent surcharge
was added

25
00:00:56,557 --> 00:01:00,060
to inspect the cargo
for changeling infiltrators.

26
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,478
What?!

27
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:04,064
You never know where
they might be hiding.

28
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,650
And a six percent tariff
was imposed

29
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,654
to help offset the lost income
of Tarkalian sheepherders.

30
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:11,864
Hardworking people.

31
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:13,448
You have to feel
for them.

32
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,367
Need I go on, Captain?

33
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:16,451
No.

34
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:19,788
I think you've made
your point.

35
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:28,714
These are the results of
the last weapons drill, sir.

36
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,471
These response times
are unacceptable, Ensign.

37
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,223
They are a little high, sir,

38
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,601
but not if you take
into account that...

39
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,227
I want these response times

40
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,271
reduced by
15 percent.

41
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,480
Schedule another drill.

42
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,066
Yes, sir.

43
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,194
(<i> sighs</i> )

44
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:54,448
Want one?

45
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,200
I'm fasting.

46
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,535
Today is<i> Ha'mara.</i>

47
00:01:58,535 --> 00:01:59,828
<i>Ha'mara?</i>

48
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,204
It's the anniversary

49
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,957
of the Emissary's arrival.

50
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:05,542
We fast to show our
gratitude to the Prophets

51
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,753
for sending him to us.

52
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:11,048
Last night, there was a festival
of lights in the capital.

53
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,424
Sounds beautiful.

54
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:13,968
Sorry we missed it.

55
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:15,302
Something tells me

56
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,596
the Captain scheduled
these negotiations

57
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:19,473
so he wouldn't
have to attend.

58
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,976
Benjamin's never been one
for ceremonies,

59
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:24,895
especially where
he's the center of attention.

60
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,648
Oh, I understand
how the Captain feels.

61
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:31,526
Still, it would have meant a lot
if the Emissary had been there.

62
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,279
After being stuck
in the Mess Hall all morning

63
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:37,574
with Quark and Hanok,
I'll bet he wishes he had gone.

64
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,951
(<i> chuckles</i> )

65
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:41,161
Two ships have just entered
sensor range.

66
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,913
They're Jem'Hadar warships.

67
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,289
Red Alert.

68
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,207
Captain Sisko
to the Bridge.

69
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,127
All hands,
battle stations.

70
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:50,004
(<i> alarm blares</i> )

71
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,749
WORF:
The Jem'Hadar are powering
up their weapons systems.

72
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,500
They are targeting
the Karemma ship.

73
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,253
They're here to punish us
for meeting with you.

74
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,297
If I give myself up

75
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,592
and assume full responsibility,
they may spare my ship.

76
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:03,344
I'm not about
to turn you over to them.

77
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:05,388
Open a channel.

78
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,015
(<i> beeping</i> )

79
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,643
This is Captain Benjamin Sisko
of the USS<i> Defiant.</i>

80
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,812
Stand down,
or we'll be forced to...

81
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,482
Return fire!

82
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,775
The Karemma ship
is coming about.

83
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:17,985
They're moving away, Captain.

84
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,987
Tell your people
to hold position.

85
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,696
We can't protect them
if they run.

86
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:24,324
The Karemma aren't responding
to our hails.

87
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,492
WORF:
The Jem'Hadar

88
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:26,785
are changing course.

89
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,036
They're going
after the Karemma ship.

90
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,454
Move to intercept.

91
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:38,839
What are they doing?

92
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,257
They're hoping
that the Jem'Hadar

93
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:41,549
won't follow them
into the atmosphere.

94
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:44,011
They'd be smart not to.

95
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,428
That's a Class-J gas giant.

96
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,264
I'm reading wind speeds

97
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:50,225
of over 10,000
kilometers per hour.

98
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,770
23 of my people
are on that ship,

99
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,480
and they're going to die

100
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,357
because I was foolish enough
to defy the Dominion.

101
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:00,194
They're not going to die,
Minister.

102
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,030
Not if I can help it.

103
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,447
Sisko to O'Brien.

104
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,033
Go ahead, sir.

105
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:09,244
SISKO: I'm taking the ship
into the atmosphere.

106
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,787
I know she wasn't

107
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,413
built for it, but I think
the ship can handle it.

108
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:13,707
O'BRIEN: Aye, sir.

109
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,292
I'll see if we can get
more power

110
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,918
to the structural
integrity field.

111
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:20,922
Adjusting shield geometry
for atmospheric entry.

112
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,175
Transferring auxiliary power
to the forward shields.

113
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:24,592
Take us in.

114
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,261
Five seconds to atmosphere.

115
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,815
KIRA:
There is so
much interference

116
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,235
our imaging systems
are practically useless.

117
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:44,196
We've hit a crosscurrent.

118
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:45,280
Head into it.

119
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,370
We've slipped between
two thermal layers.

120
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,622
Wind velocities are
a little more manageable here.

121
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:55,999
Hold this altitude.

122
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,210
Any sign of the Karemma
or the Jem'Hadar?

123
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,046
No, but sensor range
is less than two kilometers.

124
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:03,257
There might be a way
we can increase it.

125
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:04,383
SISKO:
Let's do it.

126
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,473
Mr. Hanok,
I think it'd be best

127
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,976
if you returned
to the Mess Hall.

128
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,978
As you wish, Captain.

129
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:19,231
Mr. Worf.

130
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:20,648
WORF:
Sir.

131
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,150
What's the status
of our weapons systems?

132
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,237
The cloak is not effective
in this atmosphere,

133
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:27,322
and the interference will jam
our torpedo guidance systems.

134
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,116
What about phasers?

135
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,867
We'll have to target them
manually.

136
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,786
Benjamin, we have an idea.

137
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,829
It's a little trick I learned
during the occupation.

138
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,207
Sometimes we'd evade
the Cardassian ships

139
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,750
by hiding
in the Badlands.

140
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,502
Sensor range was limited,
so we learned to use

141
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,088
an active scan system
to navigate.

142
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,881
It works by echo location.

143
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,591
We send out a modulated
tetryon pulse,

144
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,260
and if it reflects off
the hull of a ship,

145
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,677
we can approximate
its location.

146
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,805
But won't these pulses give away

147
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:52,889
our position
as well?

148
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,308
We'd have
to alter course

149
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:55,809
and speed
after every one.

150
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,695
Good news, Minister.

151
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,197
Really?

152
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,865
I think I found the problem.

153
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,576
I made the mistake
of letting my brother Rom

154
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,245
execute these contracts.

155
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,579
Your brother?

156
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,956
Yes.

157
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:20,834
I'm ashamed to say it,
but he's an idiot.

158
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,502
You see, the Federation

159
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,129
and the Karemma

160
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:27,048
have very different laws
governing commerce,

161
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,843
and I think poor Rom
must have gotten confused

162
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,637
by all the legalism.

163
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,889
Now, I will be
more than willing

164
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:38,143
to make up any losses
you might have encountered.

165
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,937
In fact, I will pay them back
with interest.

166
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,606
You cheated me, Quark,
and you haven't

167
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,608
even got the courage
to admit it.

168
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:46,818
If we survive this,

169
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,528
I'll see that
you never work

170
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,364
in the Gamma
Quadrant again.

171
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,666
Nothing within
10,000 kilometers.

172
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,751
Ahead at
one-quarter impulse.

173
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,420
Try again, Major.

174
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:11,092
There's something
400 kilometers below us.

175
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,593
It could be the Karemma.

176
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,554
I can't tell at this range.

177
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,264
Close to ten kilometers.

178
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,816
We're crossing into
another thermal layer.

179
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,529
Holding position

222
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,011
Well, we'd have to pull

The Captain's gotten us out

Last year, when the Romulans

tried to invade
the Founders' homeworld,

234
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,918
we went up against
a dozen Jem'Hadar ships.

Oh, yeah? Well, unless you

237
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,759
you better get down
to the torpedo bay

238
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,719
and start working
on those probes.

We've got to get them

If we don't seal off
that deck now,

00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,879
we'll lose the entire ship.

I don't think there's anybody
left alive up there.

361
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,461
(<i> groaning</i> )

362
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,382
Are you all right?

363
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,467
I think so.

364
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:00,473
Captain.

365
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:07,229
WORF:
Computer,

366
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,941
lights.

367
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:12,068
Bridge to Engine Room.

368
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:16,280
Boyce and Peterson
are dead, sir.

369
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:24,204
(<i> loud crackling</i> )

370
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,415
Try not
to move.

371
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,709
You took a bad blow.
Get me a medkit.

372
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,141
Bridge systems
are completely off line.

373
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:45,768
We're not getting any power
to these consoles.

374
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:55,028
There.
The bleeding's stopped.

375
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,243
He's got a concussion.

376
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:05,163
Subcranial bleeding...

377
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:06,706
We need a medic.

378
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,374
The com system's down.

379
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,793
I'll go below
and try and find one.

380
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:15,339
It's stuck.

381
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,842
WORF:
We will have to force it open.

382
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,348
I'm afraid if he
loses consciousness

383
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,892
he may slip into a coma,

384
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:27,727
but I don't think I can risk
using a stimulant on him.

385
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,103
You have
to keep him awake.

386
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:32,190
Talk to him. Give him
something to focus on.

387
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,900
All right.

388
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,526
I will attempt
to reach the Engine Room

389
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:36,944
and take over the ship
from there.

390
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,197
Good luck.

391
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,333
Captain.

392
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,920
Everything's going
to be all right,

393
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,339
but you have to try
and stay awake for me.

394
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:02,011
I'm just going to keep talking,
all right?

395
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,470
But you have to listen.

396
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:07,683
It's very important
that you listen to me,

397
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:12,396
beca... because there's
going to be a test later.

398
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,073
(<i> Dax coughing</i> )

399
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,373
How do you feel?

400
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,792
Terrible.

401
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,002
That's not surprising
considering you took in

402
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,588
a few lungfuls
of fluorine.

403
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:39,090
(<i> groans</i> )

404
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,383
Remind me to hold
my breath next time.

405
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,302
I take it we're stuck in here?

406
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:47,098
I thought of trying to climb
up the turbolift shaft,

407
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:48,808
but it flooded with gas.

408
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,477
I've had enough fluorine
for one day.

409
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,437
Maybe we should just stay put

410
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,898
and wait for someone
to come get us.

411
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:58,151
They probably don't even know
we're in here.

412
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:00,945
Our com signals can't cut
through the interference.

413
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:02,488
Is there anything else
I should know?

414
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:05,532
We only have a few hours
of breathable air.

415
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,201
Thanks, anyway...

416
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:09,787
for trying to rescue me.

417
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:12,081
A lot of good it did you.

418
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,540
I mean it.

419
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,584
It's funny.

420
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,462
A year ago, if you'd done
something like this,

421
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:22,258
I would have thought you were
just trying to be a hero.

422
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,218
And now?

423
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:27,930
Now that I know you better...

424
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:32,685
I realize it was just
a really stupid thing to do.

425
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,479
(<i> laughing</i> )

426
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,982
Ah, you're welcome.

427
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:44,530
You're taking this
too personally.

428
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,406
Okay, I cheated you.

429
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,242
I cheat everyone.

430
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:49,910
It's business.

431
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,287
You see what you
can get away with

432
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,621
and you got to figure

433
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,498
the other guy's doing
the same to you.

434
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,542
That's not the way
the Karemma conduct business.

435
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,085
Oh, come on.

436
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,377
You can't tell me

437
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:01,339
you never padded
an inventory

438
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:04,217
or pawned off a load of
substandard merchandise?

439
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:05,634
No, I haven't.

440
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,886
The Karemma believe

441
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:08,637
that merchandise
has a set value,

442
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:12,099
determined by the raw materials
and the labor

443
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,185
involved
in creating it.

444
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:18,731
Factor in transportation costs
and a reasonable profit margin

445
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:21,192
and you arrive
at a fair price.

446
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:23,777
You make it sound
so antiseptic.

447
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,071
Where's the bargaining?

448
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:26,239
Where's the scheming?

449
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,699
Where's the greed?

450
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:31,035
Greed leads to misjudgment,

451
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:33,204
and that can result
in a loss of profits.

452
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:37,041
If there's no risk,
there's no thrill!

453
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,835
Your way is just barter.

454
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,881
If you want to win big,

455
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:46,466
you got to be willing
to play the odds.

456
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,552
It's like gambling!

457
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:51,722
Gambling is the last
recourse of the desperate.

458
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:55,433
Only a fool would
risk losing what
he has to chance.

459
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:56,643
Bah!

460
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,146
(<i> sighs</i> )

461
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,523
Commander, am I
glad to see you.

462
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:02,775
The Captain is injured,

463
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,568
and all Bridge functions
are off line.

464
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:05,986
We're trying to route
command functions

465
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:08,155
to these consoles.

466
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,657
All right. I will
take command from here.

467
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,534
Who configured
these helm controls?

468
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:13,660
I did, sir.

469
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,871
They are not
laid out properly.

470
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,623
I realize they're not
the same as on the Bridge,

471
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:19,166
but I had to make
some changes, because...

472
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,418
I need to be able

473
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:22,086
to ascertain our
status at a glance.

474
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:24,797
Reconfigure these controls
to their standard layout.

475
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:27,007
Aye, sir.

476
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,759
Mr. Stevens,
you will operate

477
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,177
the echo-location system

478
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,054
we've been using
to track the Jem'Hadar.

479
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:33,347
I'll do my best.

480
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:35,015
I expect nothing less.

481
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,062
Let's get to work.

482
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:44,775
So, I, ah, I was thinking

483
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:47,069
that we could go on
a four-shift rotation,

484
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:48,862
because that
would give people

485
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:52,366
a little more flexibility
with their time.

486
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:55,328
Th-There is a down side,
because that would mean

487
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:58,164
that every shift would have...

488
00:24:58,164 --> 00:24:59,748
What am I doing?

489
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:03,669
I'm supposed to keep you awake,
not bore you to tears.

490
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,171
I'm sorry.

491
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:07,714
I don't know why
this is so hard for me.

492
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,258
I...

493
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:11,509
All I have to do is talk to you.

494
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:14,430
I mean, what do we
usually talk about?

495
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,141
(<i> faintly</i> ):
We...talk about...

496
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:24,106
work.

497
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,276
You're right.

498
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,988
That is
what we usually talk about...

499
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,950
even when we're not working.

500
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:40,622
I get the feeling
it's not that way

501
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,500
between you and Dax, or...

502
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,961
you and Chief O'Brien,

503
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:49,923
but then you're not a revered
figure in their religions.

504
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,967
I know.

505
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:56,514
You don't like it when I talk
about you as the Emissary.

506
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:00,518
That's how I think of you.

507
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,854
(<i> sighs</i> )

508
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:07,024
And maybe
that's why sometimes...

509
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:11,862
it's hard for me
to relax around you.

510
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:14,114
Nerys...

511
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,825
Y-yes, sir.

512
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,245
Tell me a story.

513
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:21,663
All right.

514
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,082
All right. Um...

515
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:27,253
Um, do you know the one
about the three brothers

516
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:28,962
who go to Jo'kala?

517
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,215
No.

518
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:36,429
Uh, they, um,
they were<i> kava</i> farmers,

519
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:40,516
and one day,
they go into their field,

520
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:44,228
and they see
the biggest<i> kava</i> root

521
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:45,521
that, uh, they've ever seen.

522
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:47,231
It's as big as a house.

523
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:49,649
"Well, that's going to make
us rich," says the oldest.

524
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:53,529
So, they decide
to sell it in the city.

525
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:56,240
Sir, I have something.

526
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:03,663
They're too small
to be ships.

527
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,249
They're closing fast.

528
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,877
Torpedoes!

529
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,003
Hard a-port.

530
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:13,966
O'BRIEN:
I'm modulating the deflectors.

531
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,427
It might confuse
their guidance systems.

532
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:24,435
Second one's still closing.

533
00:27:25,603 --> 00:27:27,729
Range 100 meters.

534
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,273
Seventy-five...

535
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,733
Fifty...

536
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:37,281
(<i> loud thump and rumble</i> )

537
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,246
Wha...?

538
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,175
HANOK:
I suggest

539
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:58,260
we leave this
room immediately.

540
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,677
And go where?

541
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:01,721
If that thing explodes,

542
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:04,682
the entire ship
will be destroyed.

543
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:06,768
No. Maybe we should try
and defuse it.

544
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:10,272
I think we should wait for help.

545
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:14,860
All right, but what if no one
can get to us?

546
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,903
(<i> hissing sound</i> )

547
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,573
I don't like

548
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:22,159
the sound of that.

549
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,370
It's up to us.

550
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:27,873
Ah, there must be

551
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:31,251
an emergency tool kit
around here somewhere.

552
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,670
There.

553
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:43,889
The arming mechanism
must be somewhere in here.

554
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:50,354
I'm going to have
to remove this casing.

555
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:51,897
How?

556
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:54,233
There's no lock
that can't be picked.

557
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,943
Looks like the torpedo
hit somewhere in here.

558
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,028
Problem is,
we're cut off

559
00:28:58,028 --> 00:28:59,071
from that part
of the ship.

560
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,406
Mm-hmm.

561
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:03,325
But we'll have to
think of something.

562
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:04,993
Mr. Stevens, recalibrate

563
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,786
the structural
integrity field

564
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:10,123
to minimize the strain
caused by the torpedo.

565
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,543
The field generators are
already at their limits

566
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:15,462
compensating for the hull breach
on deck two.

567
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,256
I am aware of the situation.

568
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,592
If you cannot
carry out my orders,

569
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:21,552
I will find someone who can.

570
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:27,974
That won't be necessary, sir.

571
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:37,984
Can I have a word
with you, sir?

572
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:39,278
Of course.

573
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:40,696
With all due respect,

574
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:43,073
I think you're riding
the men a bit hard.

575
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:44,491
You have to understand

576
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,285
they're out
of their element.

577
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:47,994
They're not
Bridge officers.

578
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:50,414
They haven't been to
Starfleet Academy.

579
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:51,873
They're engineers.

580
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:54,000
They're used to being
given a problem to solve

581
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,877
and then going out and
figuring out how to do it.

582
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,379
What are you suggesting?

583
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:59,465
Well, give them
a little slack.

584
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:00,924
Ease up on the reins.

585
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,009
Let them do what
they're good at

586
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:06,179
and give them a little
encouragement now and then.

587
00:30:07,765 --> 00:30:10,100
I will take it
under consideration.

588
00:30:16,774 --> 00:30:18,108
I'm so cold.

589
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:20,444
These walls aren't
that well insulated.

590
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:22,571
It's going
to get even colder.

591
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:23,781
Come here.

592
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,410
Better?

593
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,955
(<i> chuckles</i> )

594
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,123
What?

595
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:34,916
Just remembering something.

596
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,209
Tell me.

597
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,086
When I first got
to the station,

598
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,005
I used to have this fantasy

599
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:42,758
that you and I went off
on a runabout together

600
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:44,050
on some mission.

601
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,345
Something went wrong
with the ship

602
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:48,597
and we ended up
drifting around for a few days

603
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,683
until they sent someone
to rescue us.

604
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:53,185
If you don't mind
my saying, Julian,

605
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:55,395
that's a very
strange fantasy.

606
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,022
It seemed the only way

607
00:30:57,022 --> 00:31:00,066
that you and I could spend
any time alone together.

608
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:01,901
You were always avoiding me.

609
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,945
Oh, it's just that...

610
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,031
you came on so strong.

611
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,949
You never really
gave me a chance

612
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,242
to get to know you.

613
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:13,622
Well, you're right.
I didn't.

614
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:16,249
Well, don't worry, Jadzia.

615
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,710
It's been a long time

616
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:20,295
since I had
that particular fantasy.

617
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,963
Oh?

618
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:24,424
You sound disappointed.

619
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,218
Julian!

620
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:27,594
That's right.

621
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:30,639
You enjoyed being chased
and now you miss it.

622
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:32,057
That's preposterous,

623
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:34,476
and if you start
chasing after me again...

624
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:36,228
Oh, don't worry, Jadzia.

625
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:39,356
Now I know you liked it,
I don't need to, do I?

626
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:44,236
(<i> both shivering</i> )

627
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,328
I require your assistance.

628
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,248
I need a weapon.

629
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:58,417
We still have one
atmospheric probe.

630
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:02,087
No, if my plan is going to work,
the probe will not be available.

631
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:03,672
I need something else.

632
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:05,716
The phasers are
out of the question.

633
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:07,467
The emitters are
completely fused.

634
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:10,053
But the phaser
generator's
working fine.

635
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,304
The deflector array.

636
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,598
MUNIZ:
With a few modifications,

637
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,057
we could use it
as a phaser emitter.

638
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,852
It might not be
what you have in mind, sir.

639
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:18,270
And there is one problem.

640
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,606
It will overload
after the first shot.

641
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:22,232
I only need one shot.

642
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:24,484
How long will it take you
to make the modifications?

643
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,527
20 minutes?

644
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,070
Ten if we bypass
the safeties.

645
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,614
Proceed.

646
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:29,907
I think we should route
the generator output

647
00:32:29,907 --> 00:32:31,366
through the secondary
power grid.

648
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,618
We'll have to recalibrate
the ODN manifold.

649
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:33,702
That'll overload
the whole system.

650
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:34,870
What a mess.

651
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,413
Ah, we'll worry
about that tomorrow.

652
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:38,039
STEVENS:
Yeah, that's easy
for you to say.

653
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,082
It's your day off.

654
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:41,794
Don't count on it.

655
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:53,096
...so the three brothers
started arguing

656
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:56,433
about how to divide the money
for the<i> kava</i> root.

657
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:59,185
The oldest said
that, uh, he should get more

658
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:00,938
because it was his idea

659
00:33:00,938 --> 00:33:02,397
to sell it
in the city,

660
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,316
and the
youngest objected,

661
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:06,234
saying he was
the one to till the...

662
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:12,282
This can't happen!

663
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:13,742
You can't die!

664
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,201
You're the Emissary.

665
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,621
There's still so much
for you to do.

666
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:23,001
I don't know if this is
the right thing to do or not,

667
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:26,004
but I'm going to give
you a stimulant.

668
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:32,678
Captain...

669
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:34,721
I know my beliefs

670
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:37,808
make you uncomfortable
around me sometimes,

671
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:43,730
and... maybe that's why
you keep me at arm's length.

672
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,942
But I don't care
about that right now,

673
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,777
and I am going to pray,

674
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:50,988
because I don't know
what else to do.

675
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:53,866
I'm losing you,
and I can't let that happen.

676
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,917

We can target
the deflector from here.

682
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:27,399
Good work.

683
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,526
Take your posts.

684
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:31,361
Mr. O'Brien.

685
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:33,530
Nothing within
scanning range, sir.

686
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,532
The Jem'Hadar are out there.

687
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:36,992
You can be certain of that.

688
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:51,464
Gently!

689
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:01,934
All right.

690
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,688
Now... what?

691
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:08,648
One of these diodes

692
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:11,192
connects the warhead
to the power source.

693
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,611
The other one

694
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,195
is the firing
mechanism.

695
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,530
How do you know that?

696
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:20,452
I saw a design schematic once.

697
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:23,329
Where?

698
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:25,665
At the Ministry of Trade

699
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,292
on Karemma.

700
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:30,420
We sell these torpedoes
to the Jem'Hadar.

701
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,922
I thought
you said

702
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:35,174
you never sold
substandard merchandise?

703
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:40,764
This<i> was</i> supposed
to explode on impact, wasn't it?

704
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:47,854
Maybe I should
offer them a refund.

705
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,564
(<i> laughing</i> )

706
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:00,117
(<i> hissing</i> )

707
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:01,743
We'd better
do something

708
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:03,870
about this
torpedo of yours.

709
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,918
We have to remove
the firing diode...

710
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:13,088
only I don't know
which one it is.

711
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:17,843
And if we pick the wrong one,

712
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:19,094
we die!

713
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:29,938
Oh... it's not funny.

714
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:32,941
We just have
to pick the right one.

715
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:35,527
It's fifty-fifty.

716
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:38,113
Better odds than you get
at the dabo table.

717
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:40,073
Dabo?

718
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:41,616
Yes. It's a game.

719
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,785
If we get out of this,
I'll teach it to you.

720
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,790
Choose one.

721
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,376
How?

722
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:52,711
It's a gamble.

723
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,379
Go with your instincts.

724
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:03,180
You're thinking too much.

725
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:08,226
You just have
to reach in and...

726
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,268
pick one!

727
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,228
Ooh! Oh, oh.

728
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,855
(<i> gasping</i> )

729
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:21,447
I think we have a winner.

730
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:29,206
(<i> panting</i> )

731
00:37:29,206 --> 00:37:33,376
That was... exciting.

732
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,587
Feels good, doesn't it?

733
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:37,047
Yes!

734
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:38,965
That's how it works.

735
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:42,427
The bigger the risk,
the bigger the win.

736
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,303
Yes.

737
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:46,431
(<i> laughing</i> )

738
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:48,058
You know...

739
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:50,518
there's another risk
you could take.

740
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,395
Staying in business with me.

741
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:55,941
You never give up, do you?

742
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,195
No.

743
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:04,282
I tried to cheat you and I lost,

744
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,035
but that doesn't mean
I'm going to give up the game.

745
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,789
Come on, Hanok.

746
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:11,957
What do you say?

747
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:14,209
You want to keep playing?

748
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:20,924
Let's talk about those
Bolian currency fluctuations.

749
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:27,639
<i>Jia'kaja, tre'nu'tol'a rem...</i>

754
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,988
Yes, Captain?

755
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:45,323
What happened?

756
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,075
The Jem'Hadar hit us pretty bad,

757
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:49,161
and Worf went down
to the Engine Room...

758
00:38:49,161 --> 00:38:50,745
No, no, no.

759
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:55,500
What happened
to the three brothers?

760
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,462
They... gave all the money away

761
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:02,174
and went back
to the farm where they belonged.

762
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:03,549
(<i> sighs</i> )

763
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:06,052
It's good.

764
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,471
Major...

765
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,849
Sir?

766
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:14,602
Tell me another story.

767
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,689
I'd love to, sir.

768
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,944
I've got
something, sir.

769
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:24,279
It's the Jem'Hadar.

770
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:26,281
They've locked on
to the tetryon pulse.

771
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,200
Stand by, Mr. Stevens.

772
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:42,630
Now.

773
00:39:57,687 --> 00:39:59,647
What do you say
we find the Karemma

774
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:00,899
and get out of here?

775
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,113
WORF:
Defiant<i> Log, supplemental.</i>

776
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:10,367
<i>Damage control teams are</i>
<i>repairing the ship's systems</i>

777
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:13,203
<i>and medics are tending</i>
<i>to injured crew members.</i>

778
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:16,455
<i>We have located the Karemma</i>
<i>ship deep in the atmosphere</i>

779
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:18,166
<i>and are moving to assist.</i>

780
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:20,001
<i>It appears that it</i>
<i>will have to be abandoned</i>

781
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:22,587
<i>and its crew brought back</i>
<i>to Deep Space 9</i>

782
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:25,090
<i>until transportation</i>
<i>can be arranged</i>

783
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,799
<i>to the Karemma homeworld.</i>

784
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:27,800
It's going to be a levy.

785
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,177
A levy?
A levy.

786
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:30,511
Where do you.....?
I don't see any levy.

787
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,180
Right here.
Put the levy right there.

788
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,777
QUARK:
Oh!

789
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:46,945
Pass five.

790
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:49,030
Too bad-- you lose
half your stake.

791
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,323
You can either quit now or...

792
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:51,657
try to double it.

793
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,326
ODO:
My advice is to take

794
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:56,204
what latinum you have left
and walk away.

795
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:58,039
Just because one loses a bet

796
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:00,708
doesn't mean
one gives up the game.

797
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,419
Exactly.

798
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:06,381
May I suggest

799
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:09,426
placing your next wager
on double down.

800
00:41:09,426 --> 00:41:13,138
Put it all on triple over.

801
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:15,140
Oh, I think
that's a big mistake.

802
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,849
Triple over.

803
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,477
Nothing personal, Quark.

804
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,146
Of course not.

805
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,159
ALL:
Dabo!

806
00:41:35,452 --> 00:41:37,745
You're really catching on.

807
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:42,125
(<i> chuckling</i> )

808
00:41:51,301 --> 00:41:52,510
Ah!

809
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:58,057
17 brothers<i> and</i> sisters.

810
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,476
Well, now...

811
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:02,270
that's quite a family.

812
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,022
Excuse me, Morn.

813
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:05,731
It's your turn.

814
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:07,400
For what?

815
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,986
Darts.

816
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:12,447
That's right.

817
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:15,325
I'm sorry, Morn.

818
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:21,539
It's been, uh...
nice talking to you.

819
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,542
Thank you
for rescuing me.

820
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,169
Now we're even.

821
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,675
Excuse me, sir.

822
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:36,095
Here's the repair schedule
we drew up for the<i> Defiant.</i>

823
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:38,139
With your approval,

824
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:41,267
we thought we'd start
by tearing out the ODN lines.

825
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,519
They're shot.

826
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:43,769
It'd be easier to get
to the manifolds

827
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:45,146
that way, and then
we figured...

828
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:47,857
Proceed at your own discretion,
Mr. Stevens.

829
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,403
Thank you, sir.

830
00:42:51,403 --> 00:42:52,820
How long will the repairs take?

831
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:55,948
16 hours.

832
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:58,451
Oh, you can do it in 12.

833
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:01,413
12-- sure.

834
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:03,373
No problem.

835
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:06,792
See?

836
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:08,794
You can give them
a little slack,

837
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:11,589
but you can't take
your hands off the reins.

838
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:18,096
The Karemma transport will be
here at 1800 hours tomorrow,

839
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:19,889
and the<i> Defiant</i>
should be ready

840
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:21,974
to escort them back
to the Gamma Quadrant.

841
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,184
Good.

842
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:24,519
Major...

843
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:27,063
it occurred to me
that we might consider

844
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:28,898
going to a four-
shift rotation.

845
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:30,316
I think the crew might

846
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:31,943
appreciate
more flexibility

847
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:33,486
in their schedules.

848
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:37,198
I'll look into it
first thing in the morning.

849
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:39,242
Major...

850
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:41,453
what are you doing
for the next few hours?

851
00:43:41,453 --> 00:43:46,583
Well, I'm... going off duty,
so I thought I'd just relax.

852
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:50,711
Would you like to go
to a baseball game?

853
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:55,133
I'd love to, sir.

854
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:56,426
Good.

855
00:43:56,426 --> 00:43:59,095
Meet me at Holosuite 3
in half an hour.

856
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:01,764
I'll... I'll see you there.

857
00:44:03,933 --> 00:44:05,393
Nerys...

858
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:11,023
You need one of those.

859
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:17,155
You can get
the hot dogs from Quark.

860
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:18,615
Hot<i> dogs?</i>

861
00:44:18,615 --> 00:44:21,326
Oh, he'll know.
