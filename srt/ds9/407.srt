1
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:06,835
Captain's Log, Stardate 49263.5.

2
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:09,367
At the request of
the Karemma Commerce Ministry

3
00:00:09,412 --> 00:00:10,881
we've brought the <i>Defiant</i>

4
00:00:10,915 --> 00:00:12,817
to a remote system
in the Gamma Quadrant

5
00:00:12,853 --> 00:00:14,846
to discuss problems
that have surfaced

6
00:00:14,891 --> 00:00:17,192
regarding
our recent trade agreement.

7
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,567
When we first agreed to use
Ferengi as intermediaries

8
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:22,939
we did it because
we knew the Dominion

9
00:00:22,976 --> 00:00:24,969
would never tolerate
direct trade

10
00:00:25,013 --> 00:00:26,846
between us and the Federation.

11
00:00:26,884 --> 00:00:28,547
And we're glad to be of service

12
00:00:28,587 --> 00:00:31,184
and I'm happy to say that
not a single Ferengi vessel

13
00:00:31,226 --> 00:00:33,162
has been stopped
by the Jem'Hadar.

14
00:00:33,198 --> 00:00:36,603
Unfortunately, we have found
there is very little profit

15
00:00:36,639 --> 00:00:39,042
in doing business
with the Federation.

16
00:00:39,078 --> 00:00:41,982
In order to comply
with all your commerce laws

17
00:00:42,017 --> 00:00:44,853
we have had to pay
a series of taxes and fees

18
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,020
that have made
the costs too high.

19
00:00:47,061 --> 00:00:50,592
What sort of taxes and fees
are you referring to?

20
00:00:50,636 --> 00:00:51,900
For example

21
00:00:51,939 --> 00:00:54,604
on a recent shipment
of Karemman fleece

22
00:00:54,644 --> 00:00:56,979
a four percent surcharge
was added

23
00:00:57,016 --> 00:01:00,421
to inspect the cargo
for changeling infiltrators.

24
00:01:00,457 --> 00:01:01,892
What?!

25
00:01:01,927 --> 00:01:04,398
You never know
where they might be hiding.

26
00:01:04,433 --> 00:01:07,064
And a six percent tariff
was imposed

27
00:01:07,105 --> 00:01:11,012
to help offset the lost income
of Tarkalian sheepherders.

28
00:01:11,047 --> 00:01:12,208
Hardworking people.

29
00:01:12,251 --> 00:01:13,811
You have to feel for them.

30
00:01:13,854 --> 00:01:15,687
Need I go on, Captain?

31
00:01:15,725 --> 00:01:16,852
No.

32
00:01:16,894 --> 00:01:20,095
I think you've made your point.

33
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:29,044
These are the results
of the last weapons drill, sir.

34
00:01:33,831 --> 00:01:36,827
These response times
are unacceptable, Ensign.

35
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:38,670
They are a little high, sir

36
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:40,975
but not if you take
into account that...

37
00:01:41,013 --> 00:01:44,612
I want these response times
reduced by 15 percent.

38
00:01:44,654 --> 00:01:45,815
Schedule another drill.

39
00:01:45,858 --> 00:01:47,418
Yes, sir.

40
00:01:53,274 --> 00:01:54,800
Want one?

41
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,640
I'm fasting.

42
00:01:57,683 --> 00:01:58,947
Today is <i>Ha'mara.</i>

43
00:01:58,987 --> 00:02:00,216
<i>Ha'mara?</i>

44
00:02:00,256 --> 00:02:01,657
It's the anniversary

45
00:02:01,692 --> 00:02:03,457
of the Emissary's arrival.

46
00:02:03,496 --> 00:02:05,990
We fast to show our gratitude
to the Prophets

47
00:02:06,035 --> 00:02:08,199
for sending him to us.

48
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,441
Last night, there was a festival
of lights in the capital.

49
00:02:11,481 --> 00:02:12,814
Sounds beautiful.

50
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,319
Sorry we missed it.

51
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,753
Something tells me

52
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,159
the Captain scheduled
these negotiations

53
00:02:18,195 --> 00:02:19,994
so he wouldn't have to attend.

54
00:02:20,033 --> 00:02:22,504
Benjamin's never been one
for ceremonies

55
00:02:22,538 --> 00:02:25,339
especially where
he's the center of attention.

56
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:28,042
Oh, I understand
how the Captain feels.

57
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:32,047
Still, it would have meant a lot
if the Emissary had been there.

58
00:02:32,092 --> 00:02:34,825
After being stuck
in the Mess Hall all morning

59
00:02:34,865 --> 00:02:38,032
with Quark and Hanok,
I'll bet he wishes he had gone.

60
00:02:39,442 --> 00:02:41,640
Two ships have just entered
sensor range.

61
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,377
They're Jem'Hadar warships.

62
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:44,750
Red Alert.

63
00:02:44,787 --> 00:02:46,689
Captain Sisko to the Bridge.

64
00:02:46,725 --> 00:02:48,592
All hands, battle stations.

65
00:04:47,859 --> 00:04:50,456
The Jem'Hadar are powering
up their weapons systems.

66
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,161
They are targeting
the Karemma ship.

67
00:04:52,201 --> 00:04:53,932
They're here to punish us
for meeting with you.

68
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:56,943
If I give myself up

69
00:04:56,979 --> 00:05:00,419
and assume full responsibility,
they may spare my ship.

70
00:05:00,453 --> 00:05:02,981
I'm not about
to turn you over to them.

71
00:05:03,025 --> 00:05:05,086
Open a channel.

72
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:09,366
This is Captain Benjamin Sisko
of the USS <i>Defiant.</i>

73
00:05:09,406 --> 00:05:11,502
Stand down,
or we'll be forced to...

74
00:05:13,281 --> 00:05:15,148
Return fire!

75
00:05:15,186 --> 00:05:16,450
The Karemma ship
is coming about.

76
00:05:16,555 --> 00:05:17,648
They're moving away, Captain.

77
00:05:17,691 --> 00:05:19,752
Tell your people
to hold position.

78
00:05:19,795 --> 00:05:21,458
We can't protect them
if they run.

79
00:05:21,532 --> 00:05:24,095
The Karemma aren't responding
to our hails.

80
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:26,440
The Jem'Hadar
are changing course.

81
00:05:26,477 --> 00:05:27,810
They're going
after the Karemma ship.

82
00:05:27,847 --> 00:05:29,180
Move to intercept.

83
00:05:37,234 --> 00:05:38,202
What are they doing?

84
00:05:38,236 --> 00:05:39,637
They're hoping
that the Jem'Hadar

85
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,302
won't follow them
into the atmosphere.

86
00:05:41,343 --> 00:05:43,074
They'd be smart not to.

87
00:05:43,113 --> 00:05:45,174
That's a Class-J gas giant.

88
00:05:45,218 --> 00:05:46,983
I'm reading wind speeds

89
00:05:47,022 --> 00:05:49,961
of over 10,000
kilometers per hour.

90
00:05:51,532 --> 00:05:55,233
23 of my people are on that ship
and they're going to die

91
00:05:55,274 --> 00:05:58,178
because I was foolish enough
to defy the Dominion.

92
00:05:58,213 --> 00:05:59,944
They're not going to die,
Minister.

93
00:06:01,087 --> 00:06:02,784
Not if I can help it.

94
00:06:02,824 --> 00:06:04,225
Sisko to O'Brien.

95
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,593
Go ahead, sir.

96
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:08,100
I'm taking the ship
into the atmosphere.

97
00:06:09,037 --> 00:06:10,404
I know she wasn't

98
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,501
built for it, but I think
the ship can handle it.

99
00:06:12,545 --> 00:06:13,513
Aye, sir.

100
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,073
I'll see if we can get
more power

101
00:06:15,118 --> 00:06:16,712
to the structural
integrity field.

102
00:06:16,855 --> 00:06:20,796
Adjusting shield geometry
for atmospheric entry.

103
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:22,890
Transferring auxiliary power
to the forward shields.

104
00:06:22,934 --> 00:06:24,369
Take us in.

105
00:06:24,404 --> 00:06:26,033
Five seconds to atmosphere.

106
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,701
There is so much interference

107
00:06:38,736 --> 00:06:41,139
our imaging systems
are practically useless.

108
00:06:41,175 --> 00:06:44,045
We've hit a crosscurrent.

109
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,070
Head into it.

110
00:06:48,724 --> 00:06:51,287
We've slipped between
two thermal layers.

111
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:54,497
Wind velocities are
a little more manageable here.

112
00:06:54,537 --> 00:06:55,505
Hold this altitude.

113
00:06:55,539 --> 00:06:57,338
Any sign of the Karemma
or the Jem'Hadar?

114
00:06:57,376 --> 00:07:01,009
No, but sensor range
is less than two kilometers.

115
00:07:01,052 --> 00:07:03,148
There might be a way
we can increase it.

116
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,179
Let's do it.

117
00:07:09,837 --> 00:07:12,365
Mr. Hanok, I think it'd be best

118
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:14,846
if you returned
to the Mess Hall.

119
00:07:14,882 --> 00:07:16,818
As you wish, Captain.

120
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:19,357
Mr. Worf.

121
00:07:19,392 --> 00:07:20,691
Sir.

122
00:07:20,728 --> 00:07:22,163
What's the status
of our weapons systems?

123
00:07:22,198 --> 00:07:24,328
The cloak is not effective
in this atmosphere

124
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:27,206
and the interference will jam
our torpedo guidance systems.

125
00:07:27,242 --> 00:07:29,144
What about phasers?

126
00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:30,773
We'll have to target them
manually.

127
00:07:30,816 --> 00:07:32,251
Benjamin, we have an idea.

128
00:07:32,287 --> 00:07:34,781
It's a little trick I learned
during the occupation.

129
00:07:34,825 --> 00:07:37,126
Sometimes we'd evade
the Cardassian ships

130
00:07:37,164 --> 00:07:38,633
by hiding in the Badlands.

131
00:07:38,668 --> 00:07:41,435
Sensor range was limited,
so we learned to use

132
00:07:41,473 --> 00:07:42,999
an active scan system
to navigate.

133
00:07:43,044 --> 00:07:44,877
It works by echo location.

134
00:07:44,914 --> 00:07:46,611
We send out a modulated
tetryon pulse

135
00:07:46,651 --> 00:07:48,280
and if it reflects
off the hull of a ship

136
00:07:48,322 --> 00:07:49,621
we can approximate its location.

137
00:07:49,658 --> 00:07:52,859
But won't these pulses give away
our position as well?

138
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:55,700
We'd have to alter course
and speed after every one.

139
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,623
Good news, Minister.

140
00:08:07,698 --> 00:08:09,099
Really?

141
00:08:09,134 --> 00:08:10,831
I think I found the problem.

142
00:08:10,871 --> 00:08:13,468
I made the mistake
of letting my brother Rom

143
00:08:13,511 --> 00:08:15,208
execute these contracts.

144
00:08:15,248 --> 00:08:16,649
Your brother?

145
00:08:16,684 --> 00:08:18,017
Yes.

146
00:08:18,054 --> 00:08:20,753
I'm ashamed to say it,
but he's an idiot.

147
00:08:20,793 --> 00:08:24,096
You see, the Federation
and the Karemma

148
00:08:24,134 --> 00:08:27,004
have very different laws
governing commerce

149
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:30,446
and I think poor Rom
must have gotten confused

150
00:08:30,481 --> 00:08:32,611
by all the legalism.

151
00:08:32,652 --> 00:08:34,850
Now, I will be
more than willing

152
00:08:34,891 --> 00:08:38,126
to make up any losses
you might have encountered.

153
00:08:38,165 --> 00:08:41,069
In fact, I will pay them back
with interest.

154
00:08:41,105 --> 00:08:43,599
You cheated me, Quark,
and you haven't

155
00:08:43,644 --> 00:08:45,614
even got the courage
to admit it.

156
00:08:45,648 --> 00:08:46,947
If we survive this

157
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:50,321
I'll see that you never work
in the Gamma Quadrant again.

158
00:08:59,244 --> 00:09:01,681
Nothing within
10,000 kilometers.

159
00:09:01,716 --> 00:09:03,686
Ahead at one-quarter impulse.

160
00:09:03,754 --> 00:09:05,383
Try again, Major.

161
00:09:08,665 --> 00:09:11,068
There's something
400 kilometers below us.

162
00:09:11,104 --> 00:09:12,664
It could be the Karemma.

163
00:09:12,707 --> 00:09:14,540
I can't tell at this range.

164
00:09:14,578 --> 00:09:16,241
Close to ten kilometers.

165
00:09:23,665 --> 00:09:26,797
We're crossing into
another thermal layer.

166
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,568
Holding position
at ten kilometers.

167
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:32,709
Major?

168
00:09:37,662 --> 00:09:40,931
From the size of it,
I'd say it's the Karemma.

169
00:09:43,174 --> 00:09:44,939
I'm picking up two more ships.

170
00:09:52,996 --> 00:09:54,590
Shields at 60 percent.

171
00:09:54,633 --> 00:09:56,466
Return fire!

172
00:09:56,503 --> 00:09:59,635
The Jem'Hadar
are breaking off their attack.

173
00:09:59,677 --> 00:10:00,736
Are they going
after the Karemma?

174
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:02,339
I don't think
they've spotted them.

175
00:10:02,383 --> 00:10:04,410
Captain, impulse
power is off line.

176
00:10:04,454 --> 00:10:05,444
We're losing altitude.

177
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,620
Try using thrusters
to stabilize.

178
00:10:09,131 --> 00:10:10,498
It's no use.

179
00:10:10,534 --> 00:10:12,094
Hull pressure at two million GSC
and rising.

180
00:10:12,138 --> 00:10:13,835
Sisko to Engine Room.

181
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,344
We need impulse power.

182
00:10:15,379 --> 00:10:18,044
The primary ODN lines
have overloaded, Captain.

183
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:19,576
It'll be a few minutes.

184
00:10:19,621 --> 00:10:22,617
Chief, if you can spare someone
to meet me in Jefferies tube 4

185
00:10:22,661 --> 00:10:25,725
I'll try to reroute the power
through the secondary couplings.

186
00:10:28,573 --> 00:10:29,802
Muniz, you go.

187
00:10:29,843 --> 00:10:31,369
Yes, sir.

188
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,779
Hull pressure at nine million
GSC and still rising.

189
00:10:47,816 --> 00:10:50,287
If we keep losing
altitude at this rate

190
00:10:50,321 --> 00:10:52,519
the hull will collapse
in less than six minutes.

191
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,430
Sir, the phaser couplings were
overloaded during the attack.

192
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:57,369
It'll take at least two hours
to repair them.

193
00:10:57,404 --> 00:10:59,169
Well, the Jem'Hadar
aren't going to let us

194
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,959
tractor the Karemma out of here
without a fight.

195
00:11:01,092 --> 00:11:02,391
Right now, it seems
like we're the ones

196
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:03,830
who need to be
tractored out of here.

197
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:06,201
One thing at a time, Major.

198
00:11:06,238 --> 00:11:08,869
Sisko to O'Brien.

199
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:09,969
O'Brien here.

200
00:11:10,012 --> 00:11:11,811
How many atmospheric probes
do we have on board?

201
00:11:11,849 --> 00:11:12,817
Two.

202
00:11:12,851 --> 00:11:15,049
Could they be rigged
with warheads

203
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,058
from quantum torpedoes?

204
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,994
Well, we'd have to pull
the imaging systems out

205
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,431
to make room
in the casings, but...

206
00:11:19,466 --> 00:11:20,434
I don't see why not.

207
00:11:20,469 --> 00:11:21,768
How long?

208
00:11:21,805 --> 00:11:23,104
20 minutes.

209
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,576
You've got ten.

210
00:11:38,809 --> 00:11:40,108
You okay?

211
00:11:40,145 --> 00:11:41,774
I'm all right.

212
00:11:41,815 --> 00:11:44,788
The Captain's gotten us out
of tougher spots than this.

213
00:11:44,822 --> 00:11:46,348
Last year, when the Romulans

214
00:11:46,392 --> 00:11:48,556
tried to invade
the Founders' homeworld

215
00:11:48,597 --> 00:11:50,966
we went up against
a dozen Jem'Hadar ships.

216
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:53,975
I know, Chief,
uh, you've told me the story.

217
00:11:54,009 --> 00:11:56,674
Oh, yeah? Well, unless you
want to hear it again

218
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,708
you better get down
to the torpedo bay

219
00:11:58,786 --> 00:12:00,688
and start working
on those probes.

220
00:12:00,724 --> 00:12:02,820
I'm going.

221
00:12:04,966 --> 00:12:06,435
Janklow.

222
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,600
I'm going to need
a dualitic inverter.

223
00:12:08,641 --> 00:12:10,440
There's one in the cargo bay.

224
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,812
Right, Chief.

225
00:12:17,294 --> 00:12:19,196
Hull breach on deck two.

226
00:12:19,231 --> 00:12:21,862
An emergency force field
is in place

227
00:12:21,903 --> 00:12:24,466
but it won't hold up long
against this pressure.

228
00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:25,944
How many people are down there?

229
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:27,471
Half a dozen in Sick Bay.

230
00:12:27,516 --> 00:12:29,418
Dax and Muniz
in Jefferies tube 4.

231
00:12:29,453 --> 00:12:31,013
We've got to get them
out of there.

232
00:12:31,057 --> 00:12:33,084
If we don't seal off
that deck now

233
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:34,825
we'll lose the entire ship.

234
00:12:42,114 --> 00:12:43,082
Easy now.

235
00:12:43,117 --> 00:12:44,244
Sisko to Bashir.

236
00:12:44,286 --> 00:12:45,413
Go ahead.

237
00:12:45,455 --> 00:12:48,052
The emergency force field
won't hold much longer.

238
00:12:48,095 --> 00:12:50,760
We've got to evacuate that deck,
so we can seal it off.

239
00:12:50,834 --> 00:12:51,961
Aye, sir.

240
00:12:52,003 --> 00:12:53,734
Let's get everybody
past that bulkhead.

241
00:12:54,743 --> 00:12:56,406
Dax, are you finished?

242
00:12:56,446 --> 00:12:57,745
Not quite.

243
00:12:57,782 --> 00:12:59,878
Get out of there
as soon as you're done.

244
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,155
In about 30 seconds, we're going
to have to seal that deck.

245
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:10,844
Bashir to Bridge.

246
00:13:10,878 --> 00:13:12,177
I'm sealing the bulkhead now.

247
00:13:13,784 --> 00:13:15,344
Dax!

248
00:13:15,387 --> 00:13:16,252
Hurry!

249
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,670
Jadzia!

250
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,116
The force field is down.

251
00:13:29,151 --> 00:13:30,984
Doctor, close that bulkhead.

252
00:13:31,022 --> 00:13:33,049
But Jadzia's still in there!

253
00:13:33,094 --> 00:13:35,121
Now, Doctor.
That's an order.

254
00:13:39,173 --> 00:13:41,337
Julian...

255
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,523
Bridge.

256
00:14:20,965 --> 00:14:22,559
Bridge.

257
00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:35,286
She did it.

258
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:36,629
Helm.

259
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,568
Take us to a higher altitude.

260
00:14:40,574 --> 00:14:42,635
O'Brien to Bridge.

261
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:45,173
One of the atmospheric probes
is armed and standing by.

262
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,085
We'll have the second one ready
in a few minutes.

263
00:14:47,122 --> 00:14:49,024
Very good, Chief.

264
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,053
All right, Major.

265
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:54,367
Now that we've got something
to defend ourselves with

266
00:14:54,405 --> 00:14:56,398
let's start looking
for the Karemma.

267
00:15:04,794 --> 00:15:06,423
We're gaining altitude.

268
00:15:06,464 --> 00:15:07,865
How can you tell?

269
00:15:07,901 --> 00:15:09,803
Oh, I've got the lobes.

270
00:15:09,838 --> 00:15:12,309
You've got them, too.

271
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:14,406
It's an old Ferengi expression.

272
00:15:14,449 --> 00:15:16,476
Usually when we say
that someone has the lobes

273
00:15:16,521 --> 00:15:18,388
we mean that they have
a keen business sense.

274
00:15:18,425 --> 00:15:20,395
That's you.

275
00:15:20,429 --> 00:15:22,593
I'll admit it...
you had me fooled.

276
00:15:22,634 --> 00:15:24,467
I thought you were
just another easy mark

277
00:15:24,504 --> 00:15:27,135
but you saw right
through my little scam

278
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:28,441
and taught me a thing or two

279
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,507
about doing business
in the Gamma Quadrant.

280
00:15:30,551 --> 00:15:33,524
I guess I've gotten lazy.

281
00:15:34,894 --> 00:15:37,525
I'm used to dealing
with the Federation.

282
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:41,432
If you thought
I was cheating you...

283
00:15:41,475 --> 00:15:44,744
oh, you have no idea
what I was doing to them

284
00:15:44,782 --> 00:15:48,119
and they still
haven't caught on.

285
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:52,530
If someone like me
could put one over on them

286
00:15:52,566 --> 00:15:56,131
think what someone
like you could do.

287
00:15:58,045 --> 00:16:00,710
Someone with my... lobes?

288
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,050
Exactly.

289
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:04,923
And I'm just the man
to help you do it.

290
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,930
We could become rich.

291
00:16:06,964 --> 00:16:09,561
Rich beyond our dreams.

292
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:17,720
You...

293
00:16:17,755 --> 00:16:19,885
are despicable.

294
00:16:23,968 --> 00:16:26,405
I hate the Gamma Quadrant.

295
00:16:27,944 --> 00:16:30,211
Sir, I have something.

296
00:16:30,249 --> 00:16:32,652
It's a Jem'Hadar ship.

297
00:16:32,688 --> 00:16:33,747
Just one?

298
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,830
They must have split up
to search for the Karemma.

299
00:16:37,866 --> 00:16:39,836
It's about 70 kilometers
above us

300
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,499
on a roughly
perpendicular course.

301
00:16:44,012 --> 00:16:45,481
Helm.

302
00:16:45,516 --> 00:16:48,147
Come about
to course 075, mark 4.

303
00:16:48,188 --> 00:16:51,389
Let's fall in behind them.

304
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:53,022
You think they detected us?

305
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:56,266
I don't know, but let's make it
harder for them.

306
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:59,039
Shut down
all nonessential systems.

307
00:16:59,146 --> 00:17:01,982
It'll minimize
our power signature.

308
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,406
All stop.

309
00:17:17,485 --> 00:17:19,546
Program the probe to home in

310
00:17:19,591 --> 00:17:22,587
on the first metallic signature
it finds.

311
00:17:24,368 --> 00:17:25,667
Sir.

312
00:17:25,704 --> 00:17:28,871
If it does not locate anything
within 50 kilometers

313
00:17:28,911 --> 00:17:30,710
the probe might turn back

314
00:17:30,748 --> 00:17:33,151
and home in on the <i>Defiant.</i>

315
00:17:33,187 --> 00:17:37,219
What if they changed course
or moved out of range?

316
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:42,039
Something tells me they may be
closer than you think.

317
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,520
The probe is ready, sir.

318
00:17:52,195 --> 00:17:53,459
Fire.

319
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,908
O'Brien to Bridge.

320
00:18:23,716 --> 00:18:25,846
Try the com panel.

321
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:29,019
Engine Room to Bridge.

322
00:18:29,996 --> 00:18:32,797
Bridge, please respond.

323
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:36,566
Save your breath.

324
00:18:37,947 --> 00:18:41,114
I don't think there's anybody
left alive up there.

325
00:18:52,112 --> 00:18:53,775
Are you all right?

326
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,009
I think so.

327
00:18:59,193 --> 00:19:00,924
Captain.

328
00:19:06,276 --> 00:19:10,377
Computer, lights.

329
00:19:10,419 --> 00:19:12,446
Bridge to Engine Room.

330
00:19:13,793 --> 00:19:16,697
Boyce and Peterson are dead,
sir.

331
00:19:24,717 --> 00:19:26,915
Try not to move.

332
00:19:26,955 --> 00:19:29,119
You took a bad blow.
Get me a medkit.

333
00:19:41,787 --> 00:19:43,757
Bridge systems
are completely off line.

334
00:19:43,792 --> 00:19:46,195
We're not getting any power
to these consoles.

335
00:19:52,712 --> 00:19:55,479
There.
The bleeding's stopped.

336
00:20:01,965 --> 00:20:03,764
He's got a concussion.

337
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:05,636
Subcranial bleeding...

338
00:20:05,673 --> 00:20:07,199
We need a medic.

339
00:20:07,243 --> 00:20:08,872
The com system's down.

340
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,247
I'll go below
and try and find one.

341
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,887
It's stuck.

342
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:18,330
We will have to force it open.

343
00:20:22,443 --> 00:20:24,846
I'm afraid
if he loses consciousness

344
00:20:24,882 --> 00:20:26,476
he may slip into a coma

345
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:28,455
but I don't think I can risk
using a stimulant on him.

346
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:29,651
You have to keep him awake.

347
00:20:29,693 --> 00:20:32,723
Talk to him.
Give him something to focus on.

348
00:20:32,766 --> 00:20:34,429
All right.

349
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,064
I will attempt
to reach the Engine Room

350
00:20:36,107 --> 00:20:37,508
and take over the ship
from there.

351
00:20:37,543 --> 00:20:39,673
Good luck.

352
00:20:50,237 --> 00:20:51,968
Captain.

353
00:20:52,075 --> 00:20:54,569
Everything's going
to be all right

354
00:20:54,614 --> 00:20:57,849
but you have to try
and stay awake for me.

355
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:02,524
I'm just going to keep talking,
all right?

356
00:21:02,565 --> 00:21:04,159
But you have to listen.

357
00:21:04,202 --> 00:21:08,337
It's very important
that you listen to me

358
00:21:08,377 --> 00:21:12,910
beca... because there's
going to be a test later.

359
00:21:30,426 --> 00:21:31,986
How do you feel?

360
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,465
Terrible.

361
00:21:33,499 --> 00:21:36,369
That's not surprising
considering you took in

362
00:21:36,406 --> 00:21:38,239
a few lungfuls of fluorine.

363
00:21:39,747 --> 00:21:42,014
Remind me to hold
my breath next time.

364
00:21:42,085 --> 00:21:43,952
I take it we're stuck in here?

365
00:21:43,989 --> 00:21:47,690
I thought of trying to climb
up the turbolift shaft

366
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,495
but it flooded with gas.

367
00:21:49,535 --> 00:21:52,029
I've had enough fluorine
for one day.

368
00:21:52,141 --> 00:21:54,043
Maybe we should just stay put

369
00:21:54,145 --> 00:21:56,673
and wait for someone
to come get us.

370
00:21:56,717 --> 00:21:58,915
They probably don't even know
we're in here.

371
00:21:58,955 --> 00:22:01,722
Our com signals can't cut
through the interference.

372
00:22:01,761 --> 00:22:03,196
Is there anything else
I should know?

373
00:22:03,231 --> 00:22:06,170
We only have a few hours
of breathable air.

374
00:22:06,205 --> 00:22:07,799
Thanks, anyway...

375
00:22:07,842 --> 00:22:10,439
for trying to rescue me.

376
00:22:10,481 --> 00:22:12,748
A lot of good it did you.

377
00:22:12,785 --> 00:22:14,254
I mean it.

378
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:16,350
It's funny.

379
00:22:16,394 --> 00:22:19,230
A year ago, if you'd done
something like this

380
00:22:19,266 --> 00:22:22,899
I would have thought you were
just trying to be a hero.

381
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:24,878
And now?

382
00:22:24,912 --> 00:22:28,683
Now that I know you better...

383
00:22:28,721 --> 00:22:33,357
I realize it was just
a really stupid thing to do.

384
00:22:36,238 --> 00:22:38,641
Ah, you're welcome.

385
00:22:42,651 --> 00:22:45,214
You're taking this
too personally.

386
00:22:45,257 --> 00:22:47,090
Okay, I cheated you.

387
00:22:47,162 --> 00:22:48,995
I cheat everyone.

388
00:22:49,032 --> 00:22:50,763
It's business.

389
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:52,432
You see what you
can get away with

390
00:22:52,473 --> 00:22:53,441
and you got to figure

391
00:22:53,475 --> 00:22:55,240
the other guy's doing
the same to you.

392
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:57,215
That's not the way
the Karemma conduct business.

393
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,844
Oh, come on.

394
00:22:58,887 --> 00:23:02,054
You can't tell me
you never padded an inventory

395
00:23:02,161 --> 00:23:04,928
or pawned off a load
of substandard merchandise?

396
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:06,334
No, I haven't.

397
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:09,366
The Karemma believe
that merchandise has a set value

398
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:12,850
determined by the raw materials
and the labor

399
00:23:12,884 --> 00:23:14,980
involved in creating it.

400
00:23:15,022 --> 00:23:19,464
Factor in transportation costs
and a reasonable profit margin

401
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:21,936
and you arrive at a fair price.

402
00:23:21,971 --> 00:23:24,534
You make it sound
so antiseptic.

403
00:23:24,576 --> 00:23:25,805
Where's the bargaining?

404
00:23:25,846 --> 00:23:26,973
Where's the scheming?

405
00:23:27,015 --> 00:23:29,452
Where's the greed?

406
00:23:29,487 --> 00:23:31,890
Greed leads to misjudgment

407
00:23:31,926 --> 00:23:34,124
and that can result
in a loss of profits.

408
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:37,763
If there's no risk,
there's no thrill!

409
00:23:37,805 --> 00:23:40,538
Your way is just barter.

410
00:23:42,883 --> 00:23:44,648
If you want to win big

411
00:23:44,688 --> 00:23:47,159
you got to be willing
to play the odds.

412
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,424
It's like gambling!

413
00:23:49,464 --> 00:23:52,665
Gambling is the last
recourse of the desperate.

414
00:23:52,705 --> 00:23:56,167
Only a fool would risk losing
what he has to chance.

415
00:23:56,212 --> 00:23:57,373
Bah!

416
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,888
Commander,
am I glad to see you.

417
00:24:01,925 --> 00:24:03,326
The Captain is injured

418
00:24:03,362 --> 00:24:05,492
and all Bridge functions
are off line.

419
00:24:05,534 --> 00:24:07,698
We're trying to route
command functions

420
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:09,037
to these consoles.

421
00:24:09,075 --> 00:24:11,444
All right. I will
take command from here.

422
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,382
Who configured
these helm controls?

423
00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:14,544
I did, sir.

424
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,819
They are not laid out properly.

425
00:24:16,858 --> 00:24:18,452
I realize they're not
the same as on the Bridge

426
00:24:18,495 --> 00:24:19,964
but I had to make
some changes, because...

427
00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:20,967
I need to be able

428
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,834
to ascertain our
status at a glance.

429
00:24:22,871 --> 00:24:25,604
Reconfigure these controls
to their standard layout.

430
00:24:25,645 --> 00:24:27,809
Aye, sir.

431
00:24:27,849 --> 00:24:31,186
Mr. Stevens, you will operate
the echo-location system

432
00:24:31,223 --> 00:24:32,886
we've been using
to track the Jem'Hadar.

433
00:24:32,926 --> 00:24:34,190
I'll do my best.

434
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,790
I expect nothing less.

435
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:40,832
Let's get to work.

436
00:24:44,252 --> 00:24:45,551
So, I, ah, I was thinking

437
00:24:45,588 --> 00:24:47,991
that we could go
on a four-shift rotation

438
00:24:48,026 --> 00:24:49,791
because that would give people

439
00:24:49,831 --> 00:24:53,202
a little more flexibility
with their time.

440
00:24:53,238 --> 00:24:56,177
Th-There is a down side,
because that would mean

441
00:24:56,211 --> 00:24:58,978
that every shift would have...

442
00:24:59,018 --> 00:25:00,681
What am I doing?

443
00:25:00,722 --> 00:25:04,595
I'm supposed to keep you awake,
not bore you to tears.

444
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:06,098
I'm sorry.

445
00:25:06,133 --> 00:25:08,604
I don't know why
this is so hard for me.

446
00:25:08,638 --> 00:25:10,107
I...

447
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:12,443
All I have to do is talk to you.

448
00:25:12,481 --> 00:25:15,385
I mean, what do we
usually talk about?

449
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,948
We... talk about...

450
00:25:22,926 --> 00:25:24,395
work.

451
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,792
You're right.

452
00:25:28,873 --> 00:25:31,276
That is
what we usually talk about...

453
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,246
even when we're not working.

454
00:25:38,561 --> 00:25:40,998
I get the feeling
it's not that way

455
00:25:41,033 --> 00:25:42,832
between you and Dax, or...

456
00:25:44,474 --> 00:25:46,444
you and Chief O'Brien

457
00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:50,284
but then you're not a revered
figure in their religions.

458
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,450
I know.

459
00:25:52,492 --> 00:25:56,866
You don't like it when I talk
about you as the Emissary.

460
00:25:58,705 --> 00:26:00,869
That's how I think of you.

461
00:26:04,384 --> 00:26:07,357
And maybe that's why
sometimes...

462
00:26:09,395 --> 00:26:12,231
it's hard for me
to relax around you.

463
00:26:12,268 --> 00:26:14,501
Nerys...

464
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,171
Y-yes, sir.

465
00:26:17,212 --> 00:26:19,649
Tell me a story.

466
00:26:19,684 --> 00:26:22,019
All right.

467
00:26:22,056 --> 00:26:23,423
All right. Um...

468
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:27,731
Um, do you know the one
about the three brothers

469
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:29,363
who go to Jo'kala?

470
00:26:29,406 --> 00:26:31,741
No.

471
00:26:31,778 --> 00:26:36,915
Uh, they, um,
they were <i>kava</i> farmers

472
00:26:36,956 --> 00:26:41,022
and one day,
they go into their field

473
00:26:41,065 --> 00:26:44,698
and they see
the biggest <i>kava</i> root

474
00:26:44,739 --> 00:26:46,208
that, uh, they've ever seen.

475
00:26:46,243 --> 00:26:47,803
It's as big as a house.

476
00:26:47,846 --> 00:26:50,113
"Well, that's going to make
us rich," says the oldest.

477
00:26:50,152 --> 00:26:53,957
So, they decide
to sell it in the city.

478
00:26:53,993 --> 00:26:56,658
Sir, I have something.

479
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:04,109
They're too small to be ships.

480
00:27:04,149 --> 00:27:05,675
They're closing fast.

481
00:27:07,957 --> 00:27:09,358
Torpedoes!

482
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:10,419
Hard a-port.

483
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:14,430
I'm modulating the deflectors.

484
00:27:14,472 --> 00:27:16,841
It might confuse
their guidance systems.

485
00:27:23,124 --> 00:27:24,855
Second one's still closing.

486
00:27:26,097 --> 00:27:28,193
Range 100 meters.

487
00:27:28,236 --> 00:27:29,705
Seventy-five...

488
00:27:30,841 --> 00:27:32,174
Fifty...

489
00:27:42,567 --> 00:27:44,697
Wha?

490
00:27:55,128 --> 00:27:58,727
I suggest we leave
this room immediately.

491
00:27:58,769 --> 00:28:00,170
And go where?

492
00:28:00,206 --> 00:28:02,336
If that thing explodes

493
00:28:02,376 --> 00:28:05,212
the entire ship
will be destroyed.

494
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,186
No. Maybe we should try
and diffuse it.

495
00:28:09,226 --> 00:28:10,855
I think we should wait for help.

496
00:28:10,896 --> 00:28:15,361
All right, but what if no one
can get to us?

497
00:28:18,379 --> 00:28:22,718
I don't like the sound of that.

498
00:28:22,755 --> 00:28:24,816
It's up to us.

499
00:28:26,964 --> 00:28:28,456
Ah, there must be

500
00:28:28,501 --> 00:28:31,770
an emergency tool kit
around here somewhere.

501
00:28:31,808 --> 00:28:33,141
There.

502
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:44,563
The arming mechanism
must be somewhere in here.

503
00:28:48,378 --> 00:28:50,849
I'm going to have
to remove this casing.

504
00:28:50,884 --> 00:28:52,513
How?

505
00:28:52,554 --> 00:28:54,855
There's no lock
that can't be picked.

506
00:28:54,892 --> 00:28:57,693
Looks like the torpedo
hit somewhere in here.

507
00:28:57,732 --> 00:28:59,793
Problem is, we're cut off
from that part of the ship.

508
00:28:59,836 --> 00:29:01,065
Mm-hmm.

509
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:03,839
But we'll have
to think of something.

510
00:29:03,878 --> 00:29:07,409
Mr. Stevens, recalibrate
the structural integrity field

511
00:29:07,453 --> 00:29:10,688
to minimize the strain
caused by the torpedo.

512
00:29:10,727 --> 00:29:13,164
The field generators are
already at their limits

513
00:29:13,199 --> 00:29:16,035
compensating for the hull breach
on deck two.

514
00:29:16,072 --> 00:29:17,905
I am aware of the situation.

515
00:29:17,943 --> 00:29:20,141
If you cannot
carry out my orders

516
00:29:20,181 --> 00:29:22,083
I will find someone who can.

517
00:29:26,094 --> 00:29:28,497
That won't be necessary, sir.

518
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:38,546
Can I have a word with you, sir?

519
00:29:38,588 --> 00:29:39,887
Of course.

520
00:29:39,924 --> 00:29:41,393
With all due respect

521
00:29:41,428 --> 00:29:43,661
I think you're riding
the men a bit hard.

522
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,935
You have to understand,
they're out of their element.

523
00:29:46,973 --> 00:29:48,636
They're not Bridge officers.

524
00:29:48,677 --> 00:29:51,012
They haven't been
to Starfleet Academy.

525
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:52,382
They're engineers.

526
00:29:52,418 --> 00:29:54,685
They're used to being
given a problem to solve

527
00:29:54,724 --> 00:29:56,455
and then going out
and figuring out how to do it.

528
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:58,020
What are you suggesting?

529
00:29:58,098 --> 00:30:00,034
Well, give them a little slack.

530
00:30:00,103 --> 00:30:01,595
Ease up on the reins.

531
00:30:01,638 --> 00:30:03,699
Let them do what they're good at

532
00:30:03,744 --> 00:30:06,740
and give them a little
encouragement now and then.

533
00:30:08,421 --> 00:30:10,688
I will take it
under consideration.

534
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,773
I'm so cold.

535
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:21,077
These walls aren't
that well insulated.

536
00:30:21,182 --> 00:30:23,175
It's going to get even colder.

537
00:30:23,219 --> 00:30:24,380
Come here.

538
00:30:27,696 --> 00:30:29,029
Better?

539
00:30:32,641 --> 00:30:33,734
What?

540
00:30:33,776 --> 00:30:35,541
Just remembering something.

541
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,879
Tell me.

542
00:30:36,917 --> 00:30:40,688
When I first got to the station,
I used to have this fantasy

543
00:30:40,724 --> 00:30:43,389
that you and I went off
on a runabout together

544
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:44,729
on some mission.

545
00:30:44,767 --> 00:30:47,000
Something went wrong
with the ship

546
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,272
and we ended up
drifting around for a few days

547
00:30:49,311 --> 00:30:51,475
until they sent someone
to rescue us.

548
00:30:51,515 --> 00:30:53,918
If you don't mind
my saying, Julian

549
00:30:53,954 --> 00:30:56,015
that's a very strange fantasy.

550
00:30:56,059 --> 00:30:57,722
It seemed the only way

551
00:30:57,762 --> 00:31:00,735
that you and I could spend
any time alone together.

552
00:31:00,768 --> 00:31:02,704
You were always avoiding me.

553
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,642
Oh, it's just that...

554
00:31:04,677 --> 00:31:06,704
you came on so strong.

555
00:31:06,748 --> 00:31:08,650
You never really
gave me a chance

556
00:31:08,686 --> 00:31:10,019
to get to know you.

557
00:31:10,055 --> 00:31:14,326
Well, you're right.
I didn't.

558
00:31:14,366 --> 00:31:16,963
Well, don't worry, Jadzia.

559
00:31:17,005 --> 00:31:18,440
It's been a long time

560
00:31:18,474 --> 00:31:20,968
since I had
that particular fantasy.

561
00:31:21,014 --> 00:31:22,643
Oh?

562
00:31:22,684 --> 00:31:25,121
You sound disappointed.

563
00:31:25,155 --> 00:31:27,125
Julian!

564
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,321
That's right.

565
00:31:28,362 --> 00:31:31,358
You enjoyed being chased
and now you miss it.

566
00:31:31,403 --> 00:31:32,770
That's preposterous

567
00:31:32,806 --> 00:31:35,175
and if you start
chasing after me again...

568
00:31:35,245 --> 00:31:37,010
Oh, don't worry, Jadzia.

569
00:31:37,049 --> 00:31:40,045
Now I know you liked it,
I don't need to, do I?

570
00:31:52,182 --> 00:31:54,049
I require your assistance.

571
00:31:55,723 --> 00:31:57,090
I need a weapon.

572
00:31:57,126 --> 00:31:59,153
We still have
one atmospheric probe.

573
00:31:59,197 --> 00:32:02,898
No, if my plan is going to work,
the probe will not be available.

574
00:32:02,939 --> 00:32:04,431
I need something else.

575
00:32:04,476 --> 00:32:06,469
The phasers are
out of the question.

576
00:32:06,513 --> 00:32:08,449
The emitters
are completely fused.

577
00:32:08,484 --> 00:32:10,785
But the phaser generator's
working fine.

578
00:32:10,822 --> 00:32:12,155
The deflector array.

579
00:32:12,192 --> 00:32:13,353
With a few modifications

580
00:32:13,395 --> 00:32:14,830
we could use it
as a phaser emitter.

581
00:32:14,865 --> 00:32:17,632
It might not be
what you have in mind, sir.

582
00:32:17,671 --> 00:32:19,140
And there is one problem.

583
00:32:19,174 --> 00:32:21,015
It will overload
after the first shot.

584
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:22,344
I only need one shot.

585
00:32:22,385 --> 00:32:24,822
How long will it take you
to make the modifications?

586
00:32:24,924 --> 00:32:25,823
20 minutes?

587
00:32:25,926 --> 00:32:27,418
Ten if we bypass the safeties.

588
00:32:27,463 --> 00:32:29,023
Proceed.

589
00:32:29,066 --> 00:32:30,592
I think we should route
the generator output

590
00:32:30,636 --> 00:32:31,797
through the secondary
power grid.

591
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:33,365
We'll have to recalibrate
the ODN manifold.

592
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:34,604
That'll overload
the whole system.

593
00:32:34,645 --> 00:32:35,613
What a mess.

594
00:32:35,647 --> 00:32:37,014
Ah, we'll worry
about that tomorrow.

595
00:32:37,051 --> 00:32:38,486
Yeah, that's easy
for you to say.

596
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,510
It's your day off.

597
00:32:39,556 --> 00:32:42,153
Don't count on it.

598
00:32:50,881 --> 00:32:53,614
...so the three brothers
started arguing

599
00:32:53,654 --> 00:32:56,889
about how to divide the money
for the <i>kava</i> root.

600
00:32:56,927 --> 00:32:59,558
The oldest said
that, uh, he should get more

601
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,971
because it was his idea
to sell it in the city

602
00:33:03,008 --> 00:33:04,807
and the youngest objected

603
00:33:04,845 --> 00:33:06,610
saying he was the one
to till the...

604
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:12,787
This can't happen!

605
00:33:12,829 --> 00:33:14,230
You can't die!

606
00:33:14,265 --> 00:33:15,791
You're the Emissary.

607
00:33:15,835 --> 00:33:18,033
There's still so much
for you to do.

608
00:33:21,248 --> 00:33:23,583
I don't know if this is
the right thing to do or not

609
00:33:23,619 --> 00:33:26,420
but I'm going to give
you a stimulant.

610
00:33:31,837 --> 00:33:33,136
Captain...

611
00:33:33,174 --> 00:33:35,270
I know my beliefs

612
00:33:35,311 --> 00:33:38,409
make you uncomfortable
around me sometimes

613
00:33:38,452 --> 00:33:44,295
and... maybe that's why
you keep me at arm's length.

614
00:33:44,331 --> 00:33:47,395
But I don't care
about that right now

615
00:33:47,438 --> 00:33:49,340
and I am going to pray

616
00:33:49,376 --> 00:33:51,609
because I don't know
what else to do.

617
00:33:51,648 --> 00:33:54,313
I'm losing you
and I can't let that happen.

Everything's ready, sir.

623
00:34:22,082 --> 00:34:23,813
We can target
the deflector from here.

624
00:34:26,524 --> 00:34:27,857
Good work.

625
00:34:27,893 --> 00:34:30,057
Take your posts.

626
00:34:30,099 --> 00:34:31,898
Mr. O'Brien.

627
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:34,134
Nothing within
scanning range, sir.

628
00:34:34,174 --> 00:34:36,076
The Jem'Hadar are out there.

629
00:34:36,112 --> 00:34:37,513
You can be certain of that.

630
00:34:50,209 --> 00:34:51,701
Gently!

631
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:02,031
All right.

632
00:35:04,642 --> 00:35:07,273
Now... what?

633
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:08,749
One of these diodes

634
00:35:08,784 --> 00:35:11,483
connects the warhead
to the power source.

635
00:35:11,523 --> 00:35:14,393
The other one
is the firing mechanism.

636
00:35:14,429 --> 00:35:15,658
How do you know that?

637
00:35:17,837 --> 00:35:20,604
I saw a design schematic once.

638
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,479
Where?

639
00:35:23,516 --> 00:35:27,582
At the Ministry of Trade
on Karemma.

640
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:30,723
We sell these torpedoes
to the Jem'Hadar.

641
00:35:30,765 --> 00:35:32,200
I thought you said

642
00:35:32,236 --> 00:35:35,368
you never sold
substandard merchandise?

643
00:35:36,745 --> 00:35:40,948
This was supposed
to explode on impact, wasn't it?

644
00:35:45,464 --> 00:35:48,129
Maybe I should
offer them a refund.

645
00:36:00,463 --> 00:36:04,062
We'd better do something
about this torpedo of yours.

646
00:36:07,846 --> 00:36:10,283
We have to remove
the firing diode...

647
00:36:10,319 --> 00:36:13,315
only I don't know
which one it is.

648
00:36:15,931 --> 00:36:18,061
And if we pick the wrong one

649
00:36:18,103 --> 00:36:19,332
we die!

650
00:36:25,285 --> 00:36:30,285
Oh... it's not funny.

651
00:36:30,329 --> 00:36:33,268
We just have
to pick the right one.

652
00:36:33,303 --> 00:36:35,866
It's fifty-fifty.

653
00:36:35,908 --> 00:36:38,402
Better odds than you get
at the dabo table.

654
00:36:38,447 --> 00:36:40,645
Dabo?

655
00:36:40,686 --> 00:36:42,053
Yes. It's a game.

656
00:36:42,088 --> 00:36:44,058
If we get out of this,
I'll teach it to you.

657
00:36:47,801 --> 00:36:49,065
Choose one.

658
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:51,735
How?

659
00:36:51,777 --> 00:36:52,972
It's a gamble.

660
00:36:53,012 --> 00:36:54,641
Go with your instincts.

661
00:37:01,364 --> 00:37:03,665
You're thinking too much.

662
00:37:03,703 --> 00:37:08,544
You just have to reach in and...

663
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,548
pick one!

664
00:37:09,582 --> 00:37:10,572
Ooh! Oh, oh.

665
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:21,735
I think we have a winner.

666
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:33,728
That was... exciting.

667
00:37:33,769 --> 00:37:35,967
Feels good, doesn't it?

668
00:37:36,007 --> 00:37:37,476
Yes!

669
00:37:37,511 --> 00:37:39,413
That's how it works.

670
00:37:39,448 --> 00:37:42,785
The bigger the risk,
the bigger the win.

671
00:37:42,822 --> 00:37:44,689
Yes.

672
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:48,527
You know...

673
00:37:48,568 --> 00:37:50,903
there's another risk
you could take.

674
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,773
Staying in business with me.

675
00:37:52,811 --> 00:37:56,273
You never give up, do you?

676
00:37:59,091 --> 00:38:00,560
No.

677
00:38:00,594 --> 00:38:04,831
I tried to cheat you and I lost

678
00:38:04,871 --> 00:38:07,365
but that doesn't mean
I'm going to give up the game.

679
00:38:09,814 --> 00:38:11,147
Come on, Hanok.

680
00:38:11,184 --> 00:38:12,345
What do you say?

681
00:38:12,387 --> 00:38:14,551
You want to keep playing?

682
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:21,295

Bolian currency fluctuations.

Yes, Captain?

689
00:38:43,489 --> 00:38:45,790
What happened?

690
00:38:45,827 --> 00:38:47,626
The Jem'Hadar hit us pretty bad

691
00:38:47,665 --> 00:38:49,635
and Worf went down
to the Engine Room...

692
00:38:49,669 --> 00:38:51,263
No, no, no.

693
00:38:51,306 --> 00:38:55,908
What happened
to the three brothers?

694
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:59,948
They... gave all the money away

695
00:38:59,992 --> 00:39:02,657
and went back
to the farm where they belonged.

696
00:39:04,101 --> 00:39:06,504
It's good.

697
00:39:06,539 --> 00:39:08,942
Major...

698
00:39:08,978 --> 00:39:11,245
Sir?

699
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:14,456
Tell me another story.

700
00:39:15,826 --> 00:39:17,489
I'd love to, sir.

701
00:39:21,805 --> 00:39:23,172
I've got something, sir.

702
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:24,176
It's the Jem'Hadar.

703
00:39:24,211 --> 00:39:26,147
They've locked on
to the tetryon pulse.

704
00:39:26,181 --> 00:39:28,014
Stand by, Mr. Stevens.

705
00:39:40,948 --> 00:39:42,440
Now.

706
00:39:57,684 --> 00:39:59,551
What do you say
we find the Karemma

707
00:39:59,588 --> 00:40:00,749
and get out of here?

708
00:40:04,967 --> 00:40:07,165
<i>Defiant</i> Log, supplemental.

709
00:40:07,205 --> 00:40:10,337
Damage control teams are
repairing the ship's systems

710
00:40:10,379 --> 00:40:13,146
and medics are tending
to injured crew members.

711
00:40:13,184 --> 00:40:16,453
We have located the Karemma
ship deep in the atmosphere

712
00:40:16,492 --> 00:40:18,189
and are moving to assist.

713
00:40:18,229 --> 00:40:19,994
It appears that it
will have to be abandoned

714
00:40:20,034 --> 00:40:22,597
and its crew brought back
to Deep Space 9

715
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:25,042
until transportation
can be arranged

716
00:40:25,078 --> 00:40:26,775
to the Karemma homeworld.

717
00:40:26,815 --> 00:40:27,783
It's going to be a levy.

718
00:40:27,817 --> 00:40:28,785
- A levy?
- A levy.

719
00:40:28,819 --> 00:40:30,448
Where do you?
I don't see any levy.

720
00:40:30,489 --> 00:40:32,049
Right here.
Put the levy right there.

721
00:40:43,585 --> 00:40:45,715
Oh!

722
00:40:45,756 --> 00:40:46,951
Pass five.

723
00:40:46,992 --> 00:40:48,985
Too bad... you lose
half your stake.

724
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,294
You can either quit now or...

725
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:51,632
try to double it.

726
00:40:51,669 --> 00:40:53,366
My advice is to take

727
00:40:53,407 --> 00:40:56,174
what latinum you have left
and walk away.

728
00:40:56,213 --> 00:40:58,149
Just because one loses a bet

729
00:40:58,183 --> 00:41:00,654
doesn't mean
one gives up the game.

730
00:41:00,689 --> 00:41:02,352
Exactly.

731
00:41:04,731 --> 00:41:06,360
May I suggest

732
00:41:06,401 --> 00:41:09,397
placing your next wager
on double down.

733
00:41:09,442 --> 00:41:13,247
Put it all on triple over.

734
00:41:13,283 --> 00:41:15,150
Oh, I think
that's a big mistake.

735
00:41:15,188 --> 00:41:16,817
Triple over.

736
00:41:16,858 --> 00:41:19,489
Nothing personal, Quark.

737
00:41:19,531 --> 00:41:21,091
Of course not.

738
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,124
Dabo!

739
00:41:35,566 --> 00:41:37,696
You're really catching on.

740
00:41:51,334 --> 00:41:52,495
Ah!

741
00:41:54,274 --> 00:41:58,045
17 brothers and sisters.

742
00:41:58,082 --> 00:41:59,551
Well, now...

743
00:41:59,585 --> 00:42:02,284
that's quite a family.

744
00:42:02,324 --> 00:42:04,089
Excuse me, Morn.

745
00:42:04,128 --> 00:42:05,791
It's your turn.

746
00:42:05,832 --> 00:42:07,461
For what?

747
00:42:07,502 --> 00:42:10,099
Darts.

748
00:42:10,142 --> 00:42:12,511
That's right.

749
00:42:12,546 --> 00:42:15,450
I'm sorry, Morn.

750
00:42:15,487 --> 00:42:21,592
It's been, uh...
nice talking to you.

751
00:42:21,633 --> 00:42:24,663
Thank you for rescuing me.

752
00:42:24,707 --> 00:42:26,199
Now we're even.

753
00:42:31,255 --> 00:42:32,781
Excuse me, sir.

754
00:42:32,825 --> 00:42:36,162
Here's the repair schedule
we drew up for the <i>Defiant.</i>

755
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:38,363
With your approval

756
00:42:38,403 --> 00:42:41,376
we thought we'd start
by tearing out the ODN lines.

757
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:42,378
They're shot.

758
00:42:42,412 --> 00:42:43,904
It'd be easier to get
to the manifolds

759
00:42:43,949 --> 00:42:45,144
that way, and then we figured...

760
00:42:45,186 --> 00:42:47,919
Proceed at your own discretion,
Mr. Stevens.

761
00:42:49,662 --> 00:42:51,461
Thank you, sir.

762
00:42:51,499 --> 00:42:52,866
How long will the repairs take?

763
00:42:54,706 --> 00:42:55,970
16 hours.

764
00:42:56,043 --> 00:42:58,571
Oh, you can do it in 12.

765
00:42:58,615 --> 00:43:01,519
12... sure.

766
00:43:01,554 --> 00:43:03,456
No problem.

767
00:43:05,029 --> 00:43:06,931
See?

768
00:43:07,034 --> 00:43:09,027
You can give them a little slack

769
00:43:09,071 --> 00:43:11,668
but you can't take
your hands off the reins.

770
00:43:15,886 --> 00:43:18,255
The Karemma transport
will be here at 1800 tomorrow

771
00:43:18,291 --> 00:43:19,954
and the <i>Defiant</i> should be ready

772
00:43:20,062 --> 00:43:22,123
to escort them back
to the Gamma Quadrant.

773
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:23,431
Good.

774
00:43:23,469 --> 00:43:24,768
Major...

775
00:43:24,806 --> 00:43:27,209
it occurred to me
that we might consider

776
00:43:27,244 --> 00:43:28,975
going to a four-shift rotation.

777
00:43:29,082 --> 00:43:30,449
I think the crew might

778
00:43:30,485 --> 00:43:33,754
appreciate more flexibility
in their schedules.

779
00:43:33,792 --> 00:43:37,323
I'll look into it
first thing in the morning.

780
00:43:37,366 --> 00:43:39,462
Major...

781
00:43:39,505 --> 00:43:41,772
what are you doing
for the next few hours?

782
00:43:41,809 --> 00:43:46,843
Well, I'm... going off duty,
so I thought I'd just relax.

783
00:43:46,887 --> 00:43:50,851
Would you like to go
to a baseball game?

784
00:43:53,535 --> 00:43:55,334
I'd love to, sir.

785
00:43:55,373 --> 00:43:56,672
Good.

786
00:43:56,709 --> 00:43:59,374
Meet me at Holosuite 3
in half an hour.

787
00:43:59,415 --> 00:44:01,909
I'll... I'll see you there.

788
00:44:04,125 --> 00:44:05,560
Nerys...

789
00:44:09,069 --> 00:44:11,165
You need one of those.

790
00:44:15,016 --> 00:44:17,385
You can get
the hot dogs from Quark.

791
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:18,822
Hot dogs?

792
00:44:18,858 --> 00:44:21,489
Oh, he'll know.
