2
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:13,012
(<i> muted screaming</i> )

00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:36,620
(<i> muted, distorted</i>
<i>alarm ringing</i> )

00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,914
(<i> gasps</i> )

5
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:49,633
You all right?

6
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:51,218
What time is it?

7
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:53,012
0400.

8
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:54,722
Your hearing starts
in four hours.

9
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:56,891
I suggest trying
to get some sleep.

10
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:59,184
You've got a big day
ahead of you.

11
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,557
(<i> dings</i> )

12
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:06,812
This hearing will come to order.

13
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:09,481
We are here to consider the
request of the Klingon Empire

14
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,066
that Lieutenant Commander Worf

15
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:13,777
be extradited for trial
on charges of murder.

16
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,696
Advocate Ch'Pok.

17
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,614
You may present
your charges.

18
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,492
The Klingon Empire makes
the following allegations

19
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,870
against Lieutenant
Commander Worf:

20
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,288
That on stardate 49648

21
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,499
while commanding
the Starship<i> Defiant</i>

22
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:29,751
he knowingly fired upon

23
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,963
and destroyed a Klingon
civilian transport ship

24
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,007
near the Pentath system.

25
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:37,092
That as a result
of that action

26
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:40,554
441 Klingon civilians
were killed.

27
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,347
It is my intention to prove

28
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:45,350
that Mr. Worf was
grossly negligent

29
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,936
in his command
of the<i> Defiant.</i>

30
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:53,192
That his lust for combat
overrode his good judgment.

31
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:56,987
I ask only that he
be returned to us

32
00:03:56,987 --> 00:04:00,657
to face the judgment
of his own people.

33
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,660
Thank you.

34
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,793
The Advocate
neglected to mention

35
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:15,005
in his opening statement
that at the time in question

36
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:18,717
the<i> Defiant</i> was under attack
by two Klingon warships.

37
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:21,720
This was a combat situation
with hundreds of lives at stake.

38
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,723
It was at that moment,
when suddenly

39
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:27,101
the transport ship de-cloaked
in front of the<i> Defiant.</i>

40
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:28,602
Worf gave the order to fire.

41
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:32,814
Not because he was
reckless or negligent

42
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,817
but because he believed
he was firing on a warship.

43
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:39,654
We intend to show that the
destruction of the transport

44
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:43,283
was a tragic
but unavoidable accident.

45
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,079
I will hear formal evidence

46
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:50,207
beginning tomorrow afternoon
at 1500 hours.

47
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,840
I want to know everything
there is to know

48
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,342
about the Klingon
who was commanding
that transport ship.

49
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,929
You suspect it wasn't
just an innocent passenger run.

50
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:06,140
I'm going to argue
that he saw the battle

51
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,933
and then decided to join it

52
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,477
that he de-cloaked in order
to attack the<i> Defiant.</i>

53
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,646
Not the smartest
decision he ever made.

54
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,355
That's where you come in.

55
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,983
Use your contacts
in the Empire

56
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:18,526
and find out something
about this Captain I can use.

57
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:19,736
Was he reckless?

58
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,613
Did he have a reputation
for drinking?

59
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,615
Did he have a death wish?
Something.

60
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:25,659
I'll see what I can do.

61
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,704
CH'POK:
Captain.

62
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,792
The witnesses
I intend to call.

63
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,128
Thank you.

64
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:38,755
A remarkable
station, Captain.

65
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,132
Thank you.

66
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:42,467
We don't get many Klingon
visitors anymore.

67
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:43,760
After this case is over

68
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,304
you might be seeing
a lot more of us.

69
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:47,097
Oh?

70
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,474
<i>When</i> Worf is extradited

71
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,643
the Federation will
be forced to admit

72
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,770
that one of its officers
committed a massacre.

73
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,522
That will put you
on the defensive

74
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,731
throughout the Quadrant.

75
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,984
And while you're busy
trying to repair

76
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:01,278
a badly damaged reputation

77
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:04,031
we'll find ourselves
with certain...

78
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,658
opportunities.

79
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:10,329
An opportunity to annex
more Cardassian space

80
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:13,248
and set up additional
military bases in this sector?

81
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:14,749
Possibly.

82
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,836
But in any case, Worf
is about to present us

83
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,547
with something we never
could have won in battle.

84
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,216
Sympathy.

85
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:24,218
Any move we make
against you

86
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,761
will be seen as
a legitimate response

87
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,638
to an outrageous slaughter.

88
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,349
You're presuming
an awful lot.

89
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,433
Worf maintains
his innocence.

90
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,728
And you're about
to remind me

91
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,564
that the burden
of proof is mine.

92
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:41,400
It's an interesting system
of justice you have, Captain.

93
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,611
It does have
its flaws, however.

94
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:47,699
It emphasizes procedure
over substance

95
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,285
form over fact.

96
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:53,080
I'm sorry if you feel it
puts you at a disadvantage.

97
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,622
On the contrary.

98
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:57,251
I look forward to
fighting on your terms.

99
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:58,960
This is not a fight.

100
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,962
It's the search
for the truth.

101
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:05,592
The truth must be won.

102
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,595
I'll see you
on the battlefield.

103
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,230
I have studied
Commander Worf's reports

104
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,773
the<i> Defiant's</i> sensor logs

105
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,359
and the reports of the
other officers on the Bridge.

106
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:25,028
And I believe
every word of it.

107
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:28,448
It's a matter of pride
for the Federation

108
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,034
that Starfleet officers
never lie or commit fraud.

109
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:33,287
So I will accept
the facts of the case

110
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:35,330
as they have
been submitted.

111
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:40,127
Admiral, if there are
no facts in dispute,

112
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:43,380
then this hearing would
appear to be at an end.

113
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,674
We Klingons
are not concerned

114
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:49,261
with matters of fact
and circumstance.

115
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:51,430
What matters to us
is what was in Worf's heart

116
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,223
when he gave
the order to fire.

117
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:56,143
Was he just a Starfleet officer
doing his duty,

118
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,646
or was he a Klingon warrior
reveling in the battle?

119
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,898
That is why I am here.

120
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,775
Because if he was a Klingon

121
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:06,778
lost in the bloodlust
of combat,

122
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:10,282
only<i> we</i> can judge him,
not you.

123
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,119
We can't put a man's
heart on trial.

124
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:17,831
It's a subjective issue
that cannot be reasoned
in a court of law.

125
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,500
I ask that the Advocate
be limited

126
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,170
to arguing the evidence
in this case.

127
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,755
Someone told me this was
a search for the truth.

128
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,258
Should we not
follow that search

129
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:29,968
wherever it takes us?

130
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:34,473
The question of Commander Worf's
motive<i> is</i> relevant.

131
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:37,642
I will allow you
to explore this issue

132
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:41,188
but only as far
as logic permits.

133
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,564
I bow to your judgment.

134
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:47,652
You may call
your first witness.

135
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,821
CH'POK:
You are considered
something of an expert

136
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,907
on Klingon society,
aren't you, Commander?

137
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:56,411
My previous host, Curzon, would
have called himself an expert.

138
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:57,996
I tend to think of myself

139
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:00,999
as having a passing familiarity
with your culture.

140
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:04,044
In your opinion,
as someone with a...

141
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,796
<i>passing</i> familiarity
with our culture

142
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,756
wouldn't you say
the Klingons are

143
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:11,259
a violent, warrior race?

144
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:14,388
Yes, there is that
aspect to your people.

145
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,139
Would you agree that
one of the things

146
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,850
that makes a Klingon
warrior so formidable

147
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:23,063
is his predatory instinct,
his blood lust, if you will?

148
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,106
I'd agree with that.

149
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,692
Now, when Worf
was on the<i> Defiant</i>

150
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,736
engaged in combat,
don't you think

151
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:33,198
his predatory instinct
took over?

152
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,492
I think that instinct
was present

153
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,994
but I've seen Mr. Worf
restrain it before.

154
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,497
How do you know so much
about how he behaves in battle?

155
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:43,041
In the holosuite,
we've fought many times.

156
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:46,294
You mean you practiced
with Mr. Worf.

157
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,713
You<i> played</i> with him.

158
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,048
Oh, no.

159
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,926
When we fight, we fight.

160
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,636
<i>I've made it very clear</i>
<i>to Mr. Worf</i>

161
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:58,932
<i>that I never want him</i>
<i>to take it easy on me</i>

162
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,934
<i>because I'm a woman or a Trill.</i>

163
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,643
Have you ever been injured?

164
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,438
A few bruises here and there.

165
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:06,606
A broken finger once.

166
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,067
Nothing serious,
and I've given him

167
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:12,362
a few lumps
of his own.

168
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:15,574
CH'POK:
<i>So you're not afraid</i>
<i>of Mr. Worf.</i>

169
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:17,075
I'm no fool.

170
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,369
I can see the killer instinct
in his eyes.

171
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,872
And I know he could
kill me if he wants to.

172
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,417
But that look always goes away.

173
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:27,127
He knows when to stop.

174
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,421
<i>Jadt.</i>

175
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:30,880
Admiral, at this time

176
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,217
I would like to enter into
evidence files I obtained

177
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:35,676
from the defendant's private
data base this morning.

178
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,262
SISKO:
Objection.

179
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:40,014
There's been no search order
issued for those files.

180
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,642
This is a violation
of Mr. Worf's privacy.

181
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,519
The Captain is correct.

182
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,063
Without a properly
executed search order

183
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,898
or the permission of the
defendant, any information

184
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,526
you have accessed
from his private data base

185
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:54,154
may not be admitted
into evidence.

186
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,738
Ah. I see.

187
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,074
Well, I obviously
have no search order

188
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:01,244
so I'll ask you, Worf.

189
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,455
May I enter this file
into evidence

190
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:06,333
or do you have
something to hide?

191
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,209
(<i> whispers</i> ):
Don't play his game.

192
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,836
I have nothing to hide.

193
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,798
Use whatever you wish.

194
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,261
CH'POK:
Commander Dax,
are you familiar

195
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:21,764
with the holosuite program known
as "The Battle of Tong Vey"?

196
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,933
Yes.
It's one of the programs

197
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,311
Mr. Worf brought with him
from the<i> Enterprise.</i>

198
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,104
Describe it for us.

199
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,148
It's an historical reenactment

200
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,526
of one
of the epic Klingon battles.

201
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:36,070
10,000 warriors under the
command of Emperor Sompek

202
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:40,074
conquer the city of Tong Vey
after a long siege.

203
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,577
A glorious battle.

204
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:46,122
When Worf recreates it
in the holosuite

205
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,208
what role does he play?

206
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,460
Sompek.

207
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,795
Of course.
The conqueror's role.

208
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,839
One of our
greatest heroes.

209
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,884
Tell me, Commander.

210
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,470
What was the final order
Sompek gave to his men

211
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,139
once they had conquered
the city of Tong Vey?

212
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,648
Commander?

213
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:16,819
He told them to burn
the city to the ground

214
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,196
and kill everyone in it.

215
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:20,615
Everyone?

216
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:25,828
Not just the soldiers,
but the people of the town, too?

217
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,583
Civilians?

218
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,376
Women?

219
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,044
Children?

220
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,380
Yes.

221
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,341
CH'POK:
Now, Commander

222
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:43,762
when Mr. Worf runs this program,
does<i> he</i> give the final order

223
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:47,225
to destroy the city
and kill all of the inhabitants?

224
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,562
It's not the same thing.

225
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:52,063
It's a simulation...

226
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:53,814
Answer the question.

227
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,656
That's the way the program
is supposed to end.

228
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,074
You have to give that command...

229
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:04,242
Admiral

230
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:05,868
I ask that the witness
be instructed

231
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,538
to answer the question
"yes" or "no."

232
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,123
Yes or no, Commander.

233
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:16,879
Yes.

234
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,797
CH'POK:
Of course he does.

235
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:20,592
Because he is
a Klingon warrior.

236
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:23,928
He doesn't have
the same moral code
as a Starfleet officer.

237
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:27,515
He is one of us--
a killer, a predator
among sheep.

238
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,016
Objection!

239
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,851
Restrain yourself, Advocate.

240
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:38,359
I have only one more
question for this witness

241
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,902
Admiral.

242
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:44,616
Commander Dax

243
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:50,163
when was the last time
Worf used that program?

244
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:58,463
(<i> padd beeping</i> )

245
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,757
The day before he left
on the convoy mission.

246
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,846
The day before.

247
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,726
The<i> day</i> before.

248
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:17,023
I have nothing further.

249
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:33,540
Captain, you ordered Worf
to command the<i> Defiant</i>

250
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,750
on the mission in
question, did you not?

251
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,418
That's right.

252
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,882
How did you describe
the mission to Worf?

253
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,718
An outbreak
of Rudellian plague

254
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:47,679
has struck the Cardassian colony
on Pentath III.

255
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,597
The Cardassians are
preparing several convoys

256
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,599
of medical supplies
and relief workers

257
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,435
but the Pentath system
borders Klingon territory

258
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:59,607
and the Cardassians
are worried about raids.

259
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,861
Well, Pentath is a strategically
important system.

260
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:05,530
The Klingons will
try to stop them.

261
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,408
The problem is the Cardassians
don't have enough warships

262
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,910
available to protect
the relief convoy.

263
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,912
They've asked
for Starfleet protection

264
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,290
and because of the humanitarian
nature of the request

265
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,958
we've agreed.

266
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:21,796
There will be seven convoys
headed for Pentath III

267
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:23,214
in the next week.

268
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:25,341
Each of them protected
by a Federation starship.

269
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,678
The<i> Defiant</i> has been assigned
to escort convoy six

270
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,930
and I've chosen you
to be in command.

271
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:35,351
CH'POK:
<i>Why did you select Worf</i>
<i>for this mission?</i>

272
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,646
I felt that he was
an experienced officer

273
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:43,234
who was ready to take on
greater responsibilities.

274
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:44,652
He had a distinguished record

275
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,238
and obviously understood
the Klingons.

276
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:50,324
Weren't you a little worried,
Captain, that Worf--

277
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,493
a famed Klingon warrior--

278
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,954
might jump at the chance
for combat

279
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,749
and forget about
the plague victims?

280
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:00,334
If I were, I wouldn't
have given him the assignment.

281
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:03,379
And you're sure you
made your instructions

282
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,924
perfectly clear--
that Commander Worf

283
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:08,593
knew he was on a
humanitarian relief mission

284
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:09,886
that he was not being

285
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,679
sent out to seek combat?

286
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,013
Yes.

287
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,140
Thank you, Captain.

288
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,558
I have nothing
further for you.

289
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:21,272
Captain, since you are
also acting as defense counsel

290
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:23,817
if you wish to add anything
to the record

291
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,526
you're free to do so.

292
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,361
Not at this time, Admiral.

293
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,948
Call your next witness.

294
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:32,450
It was about 1700 hours.

295
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,577
I was doing some cleanup work.

296
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:37,789
Dr. Bashir was at the
bar talking to Etheria

297
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,457
one of the dabo girls.

298
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:42,293
Have you ever seen
the wormhole open?

299
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:43,586
No, wait.

300
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,463
It wasn't Etheria;
it was Glidia.

301
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:49,717
Have you ever seen
the wormhole open?

302
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:54,472
Or was it... Midia?

303
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,683
CH'POK:
<i>Mr. Quark, is this necess...?</i>

304
00:16:56,683 --> 00:17:01,813
No, no. No, it was Ralidia,
and she was with Morn

305
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:04,774
and he was the one
who turned to her and said...

306
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:08,152
Can we get back
to the matter at hand, please?

307
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,070
Oh, right.

308
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,198
Um... well, as I said

309
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,951
I was cleaning up,
and I saw Mr. Worf come in.

310
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:18,621
CH'POK:
<i>Was there anything unusual</i>
<i>about that?</i>

311
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,248
No. He comes in here
all the time.

312
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:24,919
But he was in a good mood.

313
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:26,337
And that's unusual?

314
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:28,297
Well, he's a Klingon

315
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,718
and you people are rarely
in what I would call good moods.

316
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:37,390
Not that you're anything
but a pleasant, charming race.

317
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,517
Let's get back to Mr. Worf.

318
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,394
Describe what happened next.

319
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:46,273
He came in, he ordered a drink--
prune juice, I believe--

320
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,067
and we started to talk.

321
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,153
I'd heard
about the convoy mission

322
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,989
so I asked him about it

323
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:56,242
and he said he was going
to be commanding the<i> Defiant.</i>

324
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,785
What was his attitude?

325
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,664
Hard to say.

326
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:05,043
He's a very private man.

327
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:08,087
He doesn't share a lot
with his bartender.

328
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,172
Did he seem...

329
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,674
afraid of the mission?

330
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:14,134
No.

331
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,136
Did he seem excited
by the mission?

332
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:19,933
Not excited exactly.

333
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:22,351
Then<i> what</i> exactly?

334
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,938
I just remember asking him...

335
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:28,816
What happens if the Klingons
go after the convoy?

336
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,903
And then he got this
funny look on his face.

337
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:33,863
He put down
his prune juice

338
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:37,199
looked me right in the
eye, and then he said...

339
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,786
I hope they do.

340
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,788
"I hope they do."

341
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:44,082
Well, it would appear

342
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:46,667
Commander Worf's
hopes were answered.

343
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,628
I have nothing further.

344
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,430
What do you have
for me, Constable?

345
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,975
Background on
the Klingon transport captain.

346
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,018
He'd never been
in the military

347
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:06,020
and he was known
to his family and friends

348
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,856
as a quiet, efficient man
who was content in his position.

349
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,025
Doesn't sound like a man

350
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:12,902
who'd suddenly decide
to take on the<i> Defiant.</i>

351
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,570
No.

352
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,740
What about this story of theirs
that the transport ship

353
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,242
just wandered off course
into a combat area?

354
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,327
I checked the flight plan

355
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,954
the Captain filed

356
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:25,790
and the projected course
was near the border.

357
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:29,127
It would have taken only a
very slight error in navigation

358
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:31,337
for the ship to stray
into the fight.

359
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:34,090
But why did he drop his cloak
right in front of the<i> Defiant?</i>

360
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:37,176
Ah, that's the question
no one seems able to answer.

361
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:41,347
No one seems able,
or no one seems willing?

362
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,016
Oh, they're too willing

363
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:45,101
to answer questions--
that's the problem.

364
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:47,103
I'm always suspicious of people

365
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,772
who are eager to help
a police officer.

366
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,984
Start looking into
the passengers on that ship.

367
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:55,402
Maybe someone with a grudge
against Worf

368
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,904
or the Federation was aboard--

369
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,948
someone who could have
seized control

370
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,908
of the ship and taken
it into the battle.

371
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,410
I'm reaching, I know.

372
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,788
But at the moment,
it's all we have.

373
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:08,207
I'll keep looking.

374
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,834
There were two Klingon ships--

375
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,961
a bird-of-prey
and an old battle cruiser.

376
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:14,421
One would engage us while
the other went after the convoy.

377
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:15,882
Then they'd switch.

378
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,717
The first ship going
after the Cardassians

379
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,635
while the second ship
came after us.

380
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,767
We've lost the number
three starboard shield.

381
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,310
Come about.

382
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,813
The cruiser has taken us
too far away from the convoy.

383
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,773
Try to keep our port side
to the Klingons.

384
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,483
Aye, sir.

385
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:38,071
This went on for-- I don't know,
maybe five minutes.

386
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:40,239
They'd come at us, try to draw
us away from the Cardassians.

387
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,866
We'd head back.

388
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:44,660
Then the bird-of-prey came
toward us off the port bow.

389
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,957
I have phaser lock.

390
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,291
Fire.

391
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:57,215
We damaged them but not much.

392
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,967
We'd seen them do this cloak-
and-run maneuver a few times

393
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,053
and Commander Worf
thought he saw a pattern.

394
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:04,513
We have them now.

395
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,933
Come to course 185 mark 278.

396
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:09,018
Stand by quantum
torpedoes, full spread.

397
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,770
Aye, sir.

398
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,522
I ran a quick sensor sweep
then I reported.

399
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,858
I'm picking up a tachyon surge
directly ahead.

400
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:16,901
Fire.

401
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:24,450
SISKO:
<i>When did you realize</i>
<i>it wasn't a bird-of-prey?</i>

402
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,077
As soon as it exploded.

403
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:27,411
Oh, my God.

404
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,163
We were all stunned.

405
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:31,999
I scanned for survivors,
but there were none.

406
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,127
Chief, do you believe

407
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:36,587
Worf was correct in
giving the order to fire?

408
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:38,923
I stand by his decision.

409
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:42,093
Is there any question
in your mind about his motives?

410
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:43,510
No, sir.

411
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,555
I've known Commander Worf
for nine years.

412
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,515
He's an honorable man.

413
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:51,144
He would never intentionally
fire on an unarmed ship.

414
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:52,561
Thank you, Chief.

415
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:00,360
I'm curious, Chief.

416
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,490
You say you stand by
Commander Worf's decision.

417
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,950
Do you agree with it?

418
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,828
I completely support him.

419
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,663
That's not my question.

420
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:13,124
Do you agree
with his decision?

421
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:15,501
I wasn't in command.

422
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:18,378
It's not my place
to question his judgment.

423
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,047
What if you were in command?

424
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,590
What would you have done?

425
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,636
I don't know.

426
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:30,016
Chief, how many years have
you been in Starfleet?

427
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:31,517
Twenty-two.

428
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:34,561
And how many combat
situations have you been in?

429
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:37,023
I couldn't even guess.

430
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:38,232
Try.

431
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:41,819
100, 150.

432
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,487
For the record

433
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:47,033
Chief O'Brien has been
in 235 separate engagements

434
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:50,786
and Starfleet has
decorated him 15 times.

435
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,706
I would like to have him
declared an expert

436
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,749
in the area
of starship combat.

437
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,293
Any objection?

438
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:59,753
None.

439
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:04,550
Chief O'Brien,
if Mr. Worf had been injured

440
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,303
could you have taken over
command of that ship?

441
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:09,263
I would have.

442
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:11,140
Let's say that happened.

443
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,351
You're in command.

444
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:16,020
<i>You're chasing</i>
<i>the bird-of-prey.</i>

445
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,604
<i>It cloaks.</i>

446
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,357
<i>You anticipate</i>
<i>your opponent's maneuver</i>

447
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:21,567
<i>so you give the order.</i>

448
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,944
Come about
to 185 mark 278.

449
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:27,198
Stand by quantum
torpedoes, full spread.

450
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:28,574
CH'POK:
<i>The crew obeys.</i>

451
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,284
<i>The ship comes about.</i>

452
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:32,619
<i>And then your helm officer</i>
<i>tells you...</i>

453
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:35,581
I'm picking up a tachyon surge,
directly ahead.

454
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:36,790
<i>Now, stop right there.</i>

455
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,625
Freeze that moment in time.

456
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,379
Everything rides
on your next decision.

457
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:43,672
<i>Do you give the order to fire?</i>

458
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,632
This isn't a fair question.

459
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,301
It didn't really
happen this way.

460
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:49,427
I wasn't in command.

461
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:51,013
CH'POK:
<i>I'm not interested</i>
<i>in whether you think</i>

462
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:52,265
<i>it's a fair question or not.</i>

463
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:54,016
<i>You're in command.</i>

464
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:55,976
<i>There's a ship out there</i>
<i>de-cloaking.</i>

465
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,895
<i>You don't know what it is.</i>

466
00:23:57,895 --> 00:23:59,397
Do you fire?

467
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,322
No.

468
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:13,869
But that's just my opinion now,
after the fact.

469
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,538
I wasn't in command that day.

470
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:20,000
Things look a lot different when
you're sitting in that chair.

471
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:27,633
I'm sure they do.

472
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:49,905
Captain Sisko

473
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:53,117
mind if I sit down?

474
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:04,378
I understand you're
going to put Worf

475
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:06,504
on the stand
this afternoon.

476
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:07,840
That's right.

477
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,549
May I make a suggestion?

478
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,179
Concede.

479
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:15,513
Let me take him back
to the Empire

480
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:17,683
and I'll make sure
he's not put to death.

481
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:20,853
In fact, I'll
defend him myself.

482
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:21,979
You?

483
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:23,647
What matters to me

484
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:26,650
is the thrill of the fight,
not which side I'm on.

485
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:30,904
And I think we both know
the extradition fight is over.

486
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:33,531
You're not making
this offer out of kindness.

487
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:35,868
You want the Federation
to concede

488
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:37,661
so the convoys will stop

489
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:42,291
and the Klingons can move in
on the Pentath system.

490
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:48,255
As humans would say,
that would be icing on the cake.

491
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:52,968
I wouldn't try eating that cake
just yet, if I were you.

492
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:58,474
But you have told me one thing
I needed to know--

493
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:05,856
you're worried about what Worf
might say on the stand.

494
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:09,860
I'm not worried--
but<i> you</i> should be.

495
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,254
ODO:
Captain.

496
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,426
Good news or bad?

497
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:36,429
Bad. I checked
the backgrounds

498
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:38,264
of every passenger
on that transport.

499
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:40,015
None had any
connection with Worf

500
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,226
or grudge against
the Federation

501
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:45,145
or any motive
for seizing control

502
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,356
of the ship and
attacking the<i> Defiant.</i>

503
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:49,483
But I'm still not
giving up.

504
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:51,777
I appreciate that

505
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:53,946
but I get the feeling
that at this point

506
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:57,408
the only one who can
help Worf is Worf.

507
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:10,712
The escort mission had
proceeded smoothly for two days.

508
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,798
We detected
several subspace distortions

509
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,091
which might have been
cloaked ships

510
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:16,260
but nothing definite.

511
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,678
SISKO:
<i>So, what was the first sign</i>
<i>of trouble, Mr. Worf?</i>

512
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:20,097
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

513
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:21,515
There was no warning.

514
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:26,145
A bird-of-prey just de-cloaked
off the port quarter.

515
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,646
Raise shields.
Arm phasers.

516
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:31,317
Commander, another
ship's de-cloaking.

517
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:32,859
It's an older battle cruiser.

518
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:35,321
She's going after the convoy.

519
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:38,031
Bring us about.

520
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,366
SISKO:
<i>How did you feel</i>

521
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:40,951
when the Klingons attacked?

522
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:43,036
Were you excited?

523
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,079
Of course.

524
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,789
I am a Klingon.

525
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,625
We live for battle.

526
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:49,376
So that's all
that mattered to you--

527
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,961
the chance to fight?

528
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:54,507
No, sir. Whatever my
personal feelings may be

529
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:57,384
I do not allow them
to interfere with my duty

530
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,178
or my professional
judgment.

531
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,388
Chief O'Brien says
that he disagrees

532
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,140
with your decision to fire.

533
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,683
How do you respond to that?

534
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:07,645
I respect the Chief's opinion.

535
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:10,063
He and I have served together
for many years

536
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,773
and I consider him a friend.

537
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:14,485
However, he was not
in command that day.

538
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:16,153
What difference does that make?

539
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:18,280
It makes all
the difference.

540
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,240
He is looking<i> back</i>
at a decision

541
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,075
analyzing it weeks later.

542
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,411
As the Commanding Officer
of the<i> Defiant</i>

543
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,079
it was my duty to look<i> forward</i>

544
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,624
to anticipate
every possible situation.

545
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:30,125
Did you anticipate

546
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:33,504
encountering a civilian ship
on this mission?

547
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:36,173
I knew our convoy
would be passing

548
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:37,966
through civilian
shipping lanes, but...

549
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,969
in my judgment, the chances
of a civilian vessel

550
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:44,181
de-cloaking in the middle
of a battle were remote.

551
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:47,226
I decided that if I were
engaged in combat

552
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:50,187
I would not hesitate to
fire at a de-cloaking ship.

553
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:53,106
Mr. Worf, I want you to think

554
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:56,776
about the civilians who died
on that transport ship

555
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:59,196
and answer one question.

556
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:02,366
Under the same set
of circumstances

557
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:03,825
would you do it again?

558
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:08,914
Yes, sir.

559
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:11,875
If I had hesitated,
I would have been negligent.

560
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:14,211
I would have been risking
my ship, my crew

561
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:15,795
and the entire convoy.

562
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:20,884
Thank you.

563
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,930
Worf...

564
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:29,518
why are you considered
an outcast among Klingons?

565
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,645
I sided with the Federation

566
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:33,564
during the invasion
of Cardassia.

567
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:35,774
For that, Chancellor Gowron

568
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,652
stripped me of my name
and my family honor.

569
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:41,905
So you acted out of conscience
and you were punished for it.

570
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,450
How do you feel about that?

571
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,660
Angry? Bitter?

572
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:50,163
I am angry about
the treatment I have received.

573
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,832
I felt it was unjust.

574
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:55,835
Of course you are.
Who wouldn't be?

575
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:58,547
What happened affected
your entire family.

576
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:01,091
The House of Mogh
was brought down.

577
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:02,718
Your brother was ejected

578
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:05,053
from the High Council
in disgrace

579
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,846
your lands seized

580
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:10,476
and now your son, Alexander,
has to bear the stigma

581
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:12,728
of being the son
of a traitor.

582
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:14,563
Did I miss anything?

583
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,107
No.

584
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:18,692
In your opinion

585
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:20,986
what do they think of you
in the Empire, Worf?

586
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:22,946
I am hated.

587
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,864
Why? Because
of what you did?

588
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:26,283
Yes.

589
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:28,452
Are you sure it's not
something more basic?

590
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,622
What is that supposed to mean?

591
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:35,083
Isn't it obvious?

592
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:39,588
You were raised by humans

593
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:41,965
on Earth

594
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:44,884
and now you wear their uniform.

595
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:49,097
Haven't you really always been
a traitor in your heart?

596
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,182
No.

597
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,767
Are you telling us

598
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:54,936
that you live with humans,
but your heart is Klingon?

599
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,021
Yes.

600
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,273
But if your heart
is Klingon,

601
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,400
how could you fire
upon your own people?

602
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,110
They fired the first shot.

603
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,113
And when that happened,
they became my enemies.

604
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:08,158
Then why aren't you glad you
destroyed that transport?

605
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:10,619
It was filled with your
enemies and their children.

606
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:12,621
There is nothing honorable

607
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:15,123
about killing those
who cannot defend themselves.

608
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:20,462
Are you telling me
that you would never

609
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:23,674
attack a defenseless
opponent?

610
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:26,301
No. I would not.

611
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:33,933
Maybe I was wrong about you.

612
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:38,480
Maybe you aren't really
Klingon in your heart.

613
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,649
A true Klingon rejoices

614
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:42,025
at the death
of his enemies--

615
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:44,570
old, young, armed, unarmed.

616
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:47,155
All that matters
is the victory.

617
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,032
Tell me, Worf--

618
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:52,077
did you weep for those children?

619
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:57,332
I grieve for them.

620
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,625
Grieve for them?

621
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,919
A Klingon does not grieve.

622
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,129
They died in glorious battle.

623
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,298
They are with the honored dead
in<i> Sto-Vo-Kor.</i>

624
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:08,176
They do not want your grief.
You dishonor their memoryies!

625
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,678
Objection!

626
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:11,388
Advocate.

627
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:12,556
WORF:
You will say anything.

628
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:14,474
You have no honor.

629
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:17,060
I say this--
you live with humans

630
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,772
because you're afraid
to live with Klingons.

631
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:21,857
I fear nothing

632
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:23,692
and if you would like
to pick up a<i> bat'leth</i>

633
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:25,527
and face me with weapons
instead of words

634
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:26,862
I will prove it to you.

635
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:28,488
You'd like that,
wouldn't you, Worf?

636
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,449
You'd love to prove
that you are as strong

637
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:32,284
and courageous as
any<i> Klingon</i> warrior.

638
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,369
I<i> am</i> a Klingon warrior.

639
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,162
Advocate, you are stepping

640
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:38,206
well beyond the
bounds of protocol.

641
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,958
And that is why
you told the Ferengi

642
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,710
you hope the Klingons
do come for you.

643
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,588
You wanted to prove
yourself in the eyes

644
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:46,005
of the only people
that matter to you--

645
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:47,716
other Klingons!

646
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:50,803
This will stop, or I will hold
both of you in contempt.

647
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:55,682
I apologize, Worf.

648
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,520
Actually...

649
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,397
I pity you.

650
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:05,984
But the person I pity most
is Alexander--

651
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,945
because one day

652
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:10,530
he will come
to you and ask

653
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,325
"Father, who am I?"

654
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:15,285
And you will have to tell him

655
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:18,956
that he is the son
of a small, frightened man

656
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:21,875
who destroyed
a ship full of children

657
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:24,002
just to prove
his own courage.

658
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,545
Worf, no!

659
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:41,687
I thought you told me you'd
never attack an unarmed man.

660
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:49,235
Perhaps you should
have said

661
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:51,237
"not unless I get angry."

662
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:56,952
"Not unless I have
something to prove."

663
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,330
I rest my case.

664
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:21,309
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 49665.3.</i>

665
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,729
<i>The hearing is in recess</i>
<i>and Admiral T'Lara</i>

666
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:27,148
<i>has retired to her quarters</i>
<i>to begin deliberations.</i>

667
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:30,276
<i>I wish I could be more</i>
<i>optimistic about her decision.</i>

668
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,778
(<i> door opens</i> )

669
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,363
Constable.

670
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:37,409
Good news.

671
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:40,078
Don't worry. If he objects,
I know what to do.

672
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,507
(<i> dings</i> )

673
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:02,642
Captain Sisko.

674
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:05,020
Admiral, I apologize

675
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,064
for interrupting
your deliberations

676
00:35:07,064 --> 00:35:08,607
but I have
some new evidence

677
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:10,025
I'd like to present.

678
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:12,069
Very well.

679
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:16,740
I'd like Advocate Ch'Pok
to evaluate the evidence

680
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,659
as an expert witness
on the Klingon Empire.

681
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:23,329
I will not compel you
to testify, Advocate.

682
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,045
Care to step
onto my battlefield?

683
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:46,269
Advocate, how would you describe
the current relationship

684
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,981
between the Federation
and the Klingon Empire?

685
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:53,026
There<i> is</i> no formal relationship
between our two governments.

686
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:55,153
What would you call us?

687
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:58,448
Informal friends?
Informal enemies?

688
00:35:58,448 --> 00:35:59,741
I would say

689
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:02,243
there is potential
for either label.

690
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:05,497
But at the moment,
neither is entirely accurate.

691
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,248
Hmm, interesting.

692
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,208
Would you agree that,
at the moment

693
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:12,045
it is difficult for us
to trust each other?

694
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:14,881
Difficult, but not impossible.

695
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:18,051
There are things that transcend
our differences.

696
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:21,220
For example, we trust
that this case

697
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,722
can be decided fairly.

698
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:23,890
We have faith

699
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,476
in Admiral T'Lara's judgment.

700
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:28,645
Oh, I'm glad to hear you have

701
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:32,732
such a profound respect
for the Admiral.

702
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:37,112
But would it be fair to say
that outside this hearing

703
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:40,281
you do not entirely trust us?

704
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:46,038
Well, it is only prudent
that we question your motives

705
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:48,040
now that we are
no longer allies.

706
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,458
Of course, and
it is only

707
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,544
prudent of us
to question your motives.

708
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:54,295
After all, aren't there times

709
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:58,800
when you feel it's in your
best interest to deceive us?

710
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,302
I object to the question.

711
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,680
It is vague
and hypothetical.

712
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,016
Well, can you imagine
<i>any</i> circumstance

713
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:10,062
in which the Empire
would deceive the Federation?

714
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:12,898
I have a poor imagination.

715
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:16,317
Let's see what we
can do to spark it.

716
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,405
Do you recognize these names?

717
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,995
These are the people who were
killed on board the transport.

718
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:28,580
You're positive?

719
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,708
There are 441 of them.

720
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:34,586
The names and faces
of these people

721
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,922
are seared into my heart.

722
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:38,924
This is a list of heroes

723
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:41,218
who died at the hands
of a coward.

724
00:37:41,218 --> 00:37:44,137
It is a list I can never forget.

725
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:48,225
They are an interesting group
of people, aren't they?

726
00:37:48,225 --> 00:37:50,143
From every walk
of life--

727
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:54,606
merchants, soldiers,
artists, shopkeepers...

728
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,024
Children.

729
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:58,651
Children.

730
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,028
We've done

731
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:02,321
some checking
in their backgrounds

732
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,032
and in our opinion

733
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,409
they all appear to be
a random group of people

734
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,828
who shared only one thing
in common:

735
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:12,165
They all traveled
on the same ship.

736
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:14,126
Is that your conclusion as well?

737
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:15,877
Yes.

738
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:18,130
And it was just fate

739
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:22,508
that led these particular people
to board a doomed ship?

740
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:26,345
Fate is a human concept.

741
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:31,268
They simply boarded the wrong
ship at the wrong time.

742
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:33,895
And then... they did it again.

743
00:38:35,272 --> 00:38:38,566
I don't, uh...
think I understand

744
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,068
your line of...

745
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,778
Three months ago

746
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:44,572
a Klingon transport ship
crashed

747
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,616
in the mountains
of Galorda Prime.

748
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:48,618
Of course, everyone
assumed the worst--

749
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:51,621
that the passengers and the crew
had all been killed.

750
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:54,124
But then, miraculously...

751
00:38:54,124 --> 00:38:57,085
everyone survived.

752
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:59,838
Do you know anyone
who was on that ship?

753
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,633
No.

754
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:05,135
Are you sure?

755
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:08,221
You have the names
of the survivors right there.

756
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:15,561
I can understand your confusion.

757
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:18,815
The names in front of you
are identical

758
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:21,985
to the names on this list.

759
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:25,488
The people who were killed
in the<i> Defiant</i> incident.

760
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:28,825
So what does this mean?

761
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:36,666
441 people somehow survived
a crash on Galorda Prime.

762
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,835
And then a few weeks later

763
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:43,340
they all decide to take
another trip on the same day

764
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:47,510
on the same transport ship,
under the same Captain and crew.

765
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,387
And then that ship
is destroyed, too.

766
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,348
This is a very unlucky

767
00:39:51,348 --> 00:39:54,726
group of people,
wouldn't you say?

768
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:59,314
I am not an expert on luck.

769
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:03,568
No. You are an expert
on the Klingon Empire.

770
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:06,988
So, tell me, Advocate

771
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:10,325
isn't it possible
that there were no civilians

772
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:12,535
on the transport Worf destroyed?

773
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:15,454
Isn't it possible
that the ship he saw

774
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:18,375
was sending out
false sensor images

775
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:20,793
and that this
whole affair was staged

776
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:23,922
so that the only Klingon
officer in Starfleet

777
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:26,174
would be accused
of a massacre
and the Federation

778
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:28,634
would be forced
to stop escorting

779
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:30,178
the convoys?

780
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:33,598
Tell me, Advocate...

781
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:38,728
isn't it possible?

782
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:46,194
Yes.

783
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:05,838
Captain.

784
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,632
I thought you should know

785
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:10,302
O'Brien and Bashir are throwing
a party for you at Quark's.

786
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:12,387
Looks like quite a bash.

787
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:14,347
I am aware of it.

788
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:17,058
But I have
much on my mind.

789
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:18,935
Ch'Pok was right.

790
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:20,895
I did have
something to prove

791
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,189
when I took command
of the convoy.

792
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:26,192
And I did not realize it

793
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:29,528
until I stood there,
looking down at him

794
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:32,615
blood trickling
from his mouth.

795
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:35,493
In that moment,
I remember thinking

796
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,579
finally, he had given me
what I really wanted--

797
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:41,666
a reason to attack him.

798
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:44,043
And I had that
same feeling

799
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:46,296
when the Klingon ships
first attacked.

800
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:49,924
Finally, a chance for vengeance.

801
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:55,972
I should not have
accepted the mission.

802
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:58,557
I am glad you realize that.

803
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:06,274
That was your first mistake.

804
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:08,151
What was your second?

805
00:42:10,195 --> 00:42:12,280
When the ship de-cloaked

806
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,615
I should have checked
the target before I fired.

807
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,701
You're damned right
you should have checked.

808
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,911
You knew there were
civilian ships in the area.

809
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:21,289
You fired at something
you hadn't identified.

810
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:30,465
You made a military decision
to protect your ship and crew.

811
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:33,759
But you're
a Starfleet officer, Worf.

812
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:37,555
We don't put civilians at risk,
or even potentially at risk

813
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,057
to save ourselves.

814
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:41,309
Sometimes that means
we lose the battle

815
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:43,811
and sometimes our lives.

816
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:46,731
But if you can't make
<i>that</i> choice

817
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:50,276
then you can't wear
that uniform.

818
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,778
Yes, sir.

819
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,364
At ease, Commander.

820
00:42:58,243 --> 00:43:01,538
Now, all that being true

821
00:43:01,538 --> 00:43:04,290
the reality is
no harm's been done.

822
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:08,461
There are no dead children
on your conscience.

823
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:09,754
You got lucky.

824
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:14,592
I do not feel lucky.

825
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,387
And that's why, despite
everything that's happened

826
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:20,765
you're going to make
a hell of a Captain someday.

827
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:22,267
Now, let's go.

828
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:23,393
They'll all be waiting.

829
00:43:23,393 --> 00:43:26,020
(<i> sighs</i> )

830
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:29,857
Look, this party
isn't for you

831
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:31,817
as much as
it is for them.

832
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:34,404
Things got a little tense
there for a while.

833
00:43:34,404 --> 00:43:37,490
They need a release,
a chance to celebrate.

834
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:40,785
But<i> I</i> do not feel
like celebrating.

835
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:41,869
Part of being
a Captain

836
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,122
is knowing when to smile.

837
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:46,791
Make the troops happy--
even when it's

838
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:49,210
the last thing in the world
you want to do.

839
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,546
Because they're your troops

840
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:54,507
and you have
to take care of them.

841
00:43:56,842 --> 00:44:00,805
Life is a great deal more
complicated in this red uniform.

842
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:03,475
Wait till you get
four pips on that collar.

843
00:44:03,475 --> 00:44:06,603
You'll wish you had gone
into botany.
