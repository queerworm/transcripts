1
00:00:47,348 --> 00:00:49,616
You all right?

2
00:00:49,653 --> 00:00:51,556
What time is it?

3
00:00:51,592 --> 00:00:53,290
0400.

4
00:00:53,397 --> 00:00:54,730
Your hearing starts
in four hours.

5
00:00:54,767 --> 00:00:57,399
I suggest trying
to get some sleep.

6
00:00:57,441 --> 00:00:59,469
You've got a big day
ahead of you.

7
00:03:03,412 --> 00:03:06,250
This hearing will come to order.

8
00:03:06,287 --> 00:03:09,159
We are here to consider the
request of the Klingon Empire

9
00:03:09,194 --> 00:03:10,629
that Lieutenant Commander Worf

10
00:03:10,665 --> 00:03:13,399
be extradited for trial
on charges of murder.

11
00:03:13,438 --> 00:03:14,532
Advocate Ch'Pok.

12
00:03:14,575 --> 00:03:17,241
You may present your charges.

13
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:20,153
The Klingon Empire makes
the following allegations

14
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:22,423
against Lieutenant
Commander Worf:

15
00:03:22,495 --> 00:03:24,797
That on stardate 49648

16
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:27,170
while commanding
the Starship <i>Defiant</i>

17
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,371
he knowingly fired upon

18
00:03:29,413 --> 00:03:32,410
and destroyed a Klingon
civilian transport ship

19
00:03:32,454 --> 00:03:34,584
near the Pentath system.

20
00:03:34,627 --> 00:03:36,723
That as a result of that action

21
00:03:36,765 --> 00:03:40,229
441 Klingon civilians
were killed.

22
00:03:40,275 --> 00:03:41,939
It is my intention to prove

23
00:03:41,979 --> 00:03:44,953
that Mr. Worf was
grossly negligent

24
00:03:44,986 --> 00:03:47,618
in his command of the <i>Defiant.</i>

25
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:52,766
That his lust for combat
overrode his good judgment.

26
00:03:52,807 --> 00:03:56,613
I ask only that he
be returned to us

27
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,387
to face the judgment
of his own people.

28
00:04:00,427 --> 00:04:03,025
Thank you.

29
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:11,454
The Advocate
neglected to mention

30
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:14,361
in his opening statement
that at the time in question

31
00:04:14,396 --> 00:04:18,270
the <i>Defiant</i> was under attack
by two Klingon warships.

32
00:04:18,307 --> 00:04:20,835
This was a combat situation
with hundreds of lives at stake.

33
00:04:20,968 --> 00:04:23,634
It was at that moment,
when suddenly

34
00:04:23,675 --> 00:04:26,307
the transport ship de-cloaked
in front of the <i>Defiant.</i>

35
00:04:26,348 --> 00:04:27,783
Worf gave the order to fire.

36
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:31,693
Not because he was
reckless or negligent

37
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:34,760
but because he believed
he was firing on a warship.

38
00:04:34,804 --> 00:04:38,837
We intend to show that the
destruction of the transport

39
00:04:38,881 --> 00:04:42,448
was a tragic
but unavoidable accident.

40
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,194
I will hear formal evidence

41
00:04:46,233 --> 00:04:49,401
beginning tomorrow afternoon
at 1500 hours.

42
00:04:55,658 --> 00:04:57,788
I want to know everything
there is to know

43
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:00,395
about the Klingon who was
commanding that transport ship.

44
00:05:00,437 --> 00:05:03,069
You suspect it wasn't
just an innocent passenger run.

45
00:05:03,111 --> 00:05:05,345
I'm going to argue
that he saw the battle

46
00:05:05,384 --> 00:05:07,048
and then decided to join it

47
00:05:07,088 --> 00:05:09,617
that he de-cloaked in order
to attack the <i>Defiant.</i>

48
00:05:09,661 --> 00:05:11,791
Not the smartest decision
he ever made.

49
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,531
That's where you come in.

50
00:05:13,571 --> 00:05:15,040
Use your contacts in the Empire

51
00:05:15,075 --> 00:05:17,639
and find out something
about this Captain I can use.

52
00:05:17,681 --> 00:05:18,843
Was he reckless?

53
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:20,753
Did he have a reputation
for drinking?

54
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,784
Did he have a death wish?
Something.

55
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:24,959
I'll see what I can do.

56
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,004
Captain.

57
00:05:30,749 --> 00:05:32,879
The witnesses I intend to call.

58
00:05:32,922 --> 00:05:35,258
Thank you.

59
00:05:35,295 --> 00:05:37,995
A remarkable station, Captain.

60
00:05:38,102 --> 00:05:39,162
Thank you.

61
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:41,677
We don't get many Klingon
visitors anymore.

62
00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:42,771
After this case is over

63
00:05:42,814 --> 00:05:44,512
you might be seeing
a lot more of us.

64
00:05:44,551 --> 00:05:46,146
Oh?

65
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:48,559
When Worf is extradited

66
00:05:48,596 --> 00:05:50,624
the Federation
will be forced to admit

67
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:53,003
that one of its officers
committed a massacre.

68
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,670
That will put you
on the defensive

69
00:05:54,712 --> 00:05:55,908
throughout the Quadrant.

70
00:05:55,948 --> 00:05:58,044
And while you're busy
trying to repair

71
00:05:58,154 --> 00:06:00,422
a badly damaged reputation

72
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,092
we'll find ourselves
with certain...

73
00:06:03,133 --> 00:06:05,628
opportunities.

74
00:06:05,673 --> 00:06:09,410
An opportunity to annex
more Cardassian space

75
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:12,389
and set up additional
military bases in this sector?

76
00:06:12,424 --> 00:06:13,757
Possibly.

77
00:06:13,794 --> 00:06:17,030
But in any case,
Worf is about to present us

78
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:19,735
with something we never
could have won in battle.

79
00:06:19,777 --> 00:06:21,269
Sympathy.

80
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,342
Any move we make against you

81
00:06:23,385 --> 00:06:25,914
will be seen
as a legitimate response

82
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,863
to an outrageous slaughter.

83
00:06:27,898 --> 00:06:29,596
You're presuming an awful lot.

84
00:06:29,635 --> 00:06:31,503
Worf maintains his innocence.

85
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,978
And you're about to remind me

86
00:06:34,013 --> 00:06:36,645
that the burden
of proof is mine.

87
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:40,720
It's an interesting system
of justice you have, Captain.

88
00:06:40,764 --> 00:06:42,894
It does have its flaws, however.

89
00:06:42,937 --> 00:06:46,902
It emphasizes procedure
over substance

90
00:06:46,947 --> 00:06:49,419
form over fact.

91
00:06:49,453 --> 00:06:52,393
I'm sorry if you feel it
puts you at a disadvantage.

92
00:06:52,428 --> 00:06:53,920
On the contrary.

93
00:06:53,965 --> 00:06:56,529
I look forward
to fighting on your terms.

94
00:06:56,571 --> 00:06:58,131
This is not a fight.

95
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,237
It's the search for the truth.

96
00:07:01,217 --> 00:07:04,681
The truth must be won.

97
00:07:04,726 --> 00:07:07,757
I'll see you
on the battlefield.

98
00:07:14,251 --> 00:07:16,780
I have studied
Commander Worf's reports

99
00:07:16,825 --> 00:07:18,420
the <i>Defiant's</i> sensor logs

100
00:07:18,462 --> 00:07:21,630
and the reports of the
other officers on the Bridge.

101
00:07:21,671 --> 00:07:24,143
And I believe every word of it.

102
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:27,514
It's a matter of pride
for the Federation

103
00:07:27,552 --> 00:07:30,150
that Starfleet officers
never lie or commit fraud.

104
00:07:30,226 --> 00:07:32,596
So I will accept
the facts of the case

105
00:07:32,632 --> 00:07:34,728
as they have been submitted.

106
00:07:34,771 --> 00:07:38,804
Admiral, if there are
no facts in dispute

107
00:07:38,848 --> 00:07:42,654
then this hearing would
appear to be at an end.

108
00:07:42,691 --> 00:07:45,927
We Klingons are not concerned

109
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,438
with matters of fact
and circumstance.

110
00:07:48,473 --> 00:07:50,535
What matters to us
is what was in Worf's heart

111
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:51,946
when he gave the order to fire.

112
00:07:51,982 --> 00:07:54,614
Was he just a Starfleet officer

113
00:07:54,656 --> 00:07:57,424
doing his duty,
or was he a Klingon warrior

114
00:07:57,464 --> 00:07:58,899
reveling in the battle?

115
00:07:58,934 --> 00:08:01,064
That is why I am here.

116
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:03,168
Because if he was a Klingon

117
00:08:03,278 --> 00:08:06,046
lost in the bloodlust
of combat

118
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:10,188
only we can judge him, not you.

119
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:13,432
We can't put a man's
heart on trial.

120
00:08:13,471 --> 00:08:14,838
It's a subjective issue

121
00:08:14,876 --> 00:08:16,972
that cannot be reasoned
in a court of law.

122
00:08:17,014 --> 00:08:19,646
I ask that the Advocate
be limited

123
00:08:19,687 --> 00:08:22,319
to arguing the evidence
in this case.

124
00:08:22,361 --> 00:08:24,993
Someone told me this was
a search for the truth.

125
00:08:25,035 --> 00:08:29,240
Should we not follow that search
wherever it takes us?

126
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,621
The question of Commander Worf's
motive is relevant.

127
00:08:33,658 --> 00:08:36,962
I will allow you
to explore this issue

128
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:40,269
but only as far
as logic permits.

129
00:08:40,374 --> 00:08:42,676
I bow to your judgment.

130
00:08:42,714 --> 00:08:47,215
You may call your first witness.

131
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:49,196
You are considered
something of an expert

132
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,964
on Klingon society,
aren't you, Commander?

133
00:08:52,005 --> 00:08:55,742
My previous host, Curzon, would
have called himself an expert.

134
00:08:55,781 --> 00:08:57,250
I tend to think of myself

135
00:08:57,285 --> 00:09:00,259
as having a passing familiarity
with your culture.

136
00:09:00,293 --> 00:09:03,233
In your opinion,
as someone with a...

137
00:09:03,267 --> 00:09:06,069
passing familiarity
with our culture

138
00:09:06,108 --> 00:09:10,415
wouldn't you say the Klingons
are a violent, warrior race?

139
00:09:10,452 --> 00:09:13,517
Yes, there is that aspect
to your people.

140
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,394
Would you agree
that one of the things

141
00:09:15,432 --> 00:09:17,904
that makes a Klingon warrior
so formidable

142
00:09:17,938 --> 00:09:22,314
is his predatory instinct,
his blood lust, if you will?

143
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,321
I'd agree with that.

144
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:27,089
Now, when Worf
was on the <i>Defiant</i>

145
00:09:27,129 --> 00:09:29,100
engaged in combat,
don't you think

146
00:09:29,134 --> 00:09:31,504
his predatory instinct
took over?

147
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:34,743
I think that instinct
was present

148
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:37,448
but I've seen Mr. Worf
restrain it before.

149
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,724
How do you know so much
about how he behaves in battle?

150
00:09:39,762 --> 00:09:42,360
In the holosuite,
we've fought many times.

151
00:09:42,402 --> 00:09:45,672
You mean you practiced
with Mr. Worf.

152
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:47,375
You played with him.

153
00:09:47,448 --> 00:09:49,282
Oh, no.

154
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,385
When we fight, we fight.

155
00:09:52,495 --> 00:09:54,865
I've made it very clear
to Mr. Worf

156
00:09:54,901 --> 00:09:58,239
that I never want him
to take it easy on me

157
00:09:58,277 --> 00:10:00,248
because I'm a woman or a Trill.

158
00:10:00,282 --> 00:10:02,014
Have you ever been injured?

159
00:10:02,053 --> 00:10:03,853
A few bruises here and there.

160
00:10:03,892 --> 00:10:05,829
A broken finger once.

161
00:10:05,863 --> 00:10:08,631
Nothing serious,
and I've given him

162
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,368
a few lumps of his own.

163
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:15,013
So you're not afraid
of Mr. Worf.

164
00:10:15,054 --> 00:10:16,455
I'm no fool.

165
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,655
I can see the killer instinct
in his eyes.

166
00:10:18,696 --> 00:10:22,194
And I know he could
kill me if he wants to.

167
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:24,677
But that look always goes away.

168
00:10:24,712 --> 00:10:26,649
He knows when to stop.

169
00:10:26,684 --> 00:10:28,655
<i>Jadt.</i>

170
00:10:28,689 --> 00:10:30,056
Admiral, at this time

171
00:10:30,093 --> 00:10:33,499
I would like to enter into
evidence files I obtained

172
00:10:33,602 --> 00:10:35,664
from the defendant's private
data base this morning.

173
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:36,836
Objection.

174
00:10:36,877 --> 00:10:39,475
There's been no search order
issued for those files.

175
00:10:39,517 --> 00:10:42,046
This is a violation
of Mr. Worf's privacy.

176
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:43,857
The Captain is correct.

177
00:10:43,896 --> 00:10:46,266
Without a properly
executed search order

178
00:10:46,301 --> 00:10:48,169
or the permission of the
defendant, any information

179
00:10:48,206 --> 00:10:50,872
you have accessed
from his private data base

180
00:10:50,914 --> 00:10:53,478
may not be admitted
into evidence.

181
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,989
Ah. I see.

182
00:10:55,024 --> 00:10:57,462
Well, I obviously
have no search order

183
00:10:57,497 --> 00:11:00,596
so I'll ask you, Worf.

184
00:11:00,638 --> 00:11:02,700
May I enter this file
into evidence

185
00:11:02,744 --> 00:11:05,650
or do you have
something to hide?

186
00:11:05,685 --> 00:11:07,519
Don't play his game.

187
00:11:07,556 --> 00:11:09,390
I have nothing to hide.

188
00:11:11,066 --> 00:11:13,368
Use whatever you wish.

189
00:11:15,577 --> 00:11:17,879
Commander Dax, are you familiar

190
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:21,050
with the holosuite program known
as "The Battle of Tong Vey"?

191
00:11:21,092 --> 00:11:23,188
Yes.
It's one of the programs

192
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,930
Mr. Worf brought with him
from the <i>Enterprise.</i>

193
00:11:25,971 --> 00:11:27,021
Describe it for us.

194
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:29,022
It's an historical reenactment

195
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:31,361
of one
of the epic Klingon battles.

196
00:11:31,398 --> 00:11:34,999
10,000 warriors under the
command of Emperor Sompek

197
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:38,949
conquer the city of Tong Vey
after a long siege.

198
00:11:38,985 --> 00:11:41,423
A glorious battle.

199
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:44,991
When Worf recreates it
in the holosuite

200
00:11:45,033 --> 00:11:47,027
what role does he play?

201
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:49,375
Sompek.

202
00:11:49,411 --> 00:11:51,747
Of course.
The conqueror's role.

203
00:11:51,784 --> 00:11:53,778
One of our greatest heroes.

204
00:11:53,823 --> 00:11:56,625
Tell me, Commander.

205
00:11:56,664 --> 00:11:59,364
What was the final order
Sompek gave to his men

206
00:11:59,404 --> 00:12:02,276
once they had conquered
the city of Tong Vey?

207
00:12:09,263 --> 00:12:10,562
Commander?

208
00:12:13,474 --> 00:12:15,708
He told them to burn
the city to the ground

209
00:12:15,746 --> 00:12:17,045
and kill everyone in it.

210
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,419
Everyone?

211
00:12:19,456 --> 00:12:24,926
Not just the soldiers,
but the people of the town, too?

212
00:12:26,809 --> 00:12:28,575
Civilians?

213
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,140
Women?

214
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:32,245
Children?

215
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,762
Yes.

216
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:37,030
Now, Commander

217
00:12:37,068 --> 00:12:42,572
when Mr. Worf runs this program,
does he give the final order

218
00:12:42,616 --> 00:12:46,285
to destroy the city
and kill all of the inhabitants?

219
00:12:47,629 --> 00:12:49,623
It's not the same thing.

220
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:51,299
It's a simulation...

221
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:52,969
Answer the question.

222
00:12:58,491 --> 00:13:00,462
That's the way the program
is supposed to end.

223
00:13:00,496 --> 00:13:01,931
You have to give that command...

224
00:13:01,966 --> 00:13:03,094
Admiral

225
00:13:03,136 --> 00:13:04,800
I ask that the witness
be instructed

226
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:07,336
to answer the question
"yes" or "no."

227
00:13:07,381 --> 00:13:09,181
Yes or no, Commander.

228
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,869
Yes.

229
00:13:15,902 --> 00:13:17,566
Of course he does.

230
00:13:17,607 --> 00:13:19,669
Because he is
a Klingon warrior.

231
00:13:19,712 --> 00:13:20,681
He doesn't have

232
00:13:20,715 --> 00:13:22,914
the same moral code
as a Starfleet officer.

233
00:13:22,955 --> 00:13:26,123
He is one of us...
a killer, a predator

234
00:13:26,163 --> 00:13:27,325
among sheep.

235
00:13:27,366 --> 00:13:28,335
Objection!

236
00:13:28,368 --> 00:13:29,998
Restrain yourself, Advocate.

237
00:13:34,016 --> 00:13:37,422
I have only one more
question for this witness

238
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:39,054
Admiral.

239
00:13:40,734 --> 00:13:43,536
Commander Dax

240
00:13:43,575 --> 00:13:49,420
when was the last time
Worf used that program?

241
00:13:57,478 --> 00:13:59,780
The day before he left
on the convoy mission.

242
00:14:05,765 --> 00:14:11,178
The day before.
The day before.

243
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,154
I have nothing further.

244
00:14:29,192 --> 00:14:32,759
Captain, you ordered Worf
to command the <i>Defiant</i>

245
00:14:32,802 --> 00:14:35,070
on the mission in question,
did you not?

246
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:36,772
That's right.

247
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,186
How did you describe
the mission to Worf?

248
00:14:42,226 --> 00:14:44,060
An outbreak of Rudellian plague

249
00:14:44,098 --> 00:14:46,832
has struck the Cardassian colony
on Pentath III.

250
00:14:46,872 --> 00:14:48,968
The Cardassians are
preparing several convoys

251
00:14:49,011 --> 00:14:50,777
of medical supplies
and relief workers

252
00:14:50,816 --> 00:14:53,847
but the Pentath system
borders Klingon territory

253
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:57,798
and the Cardassians
are worried about raids.

254
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:02,208
Well, Pentath is a strategically
important system.

255
00:15:02,245 --> 00:15:04,774
The Klingons will
try to stop them.

256
00:15:04,818 --> 00:15:07,849
The problem is the Cardassians
don't have enough warships

257
00:15:07,893 --> 00:15:10,263
available to protect
the relief convoy.

258
00:15:10,299 --> 00:15:12,236
They've asked
for Starfleet protection

259
00:15:12,271 --> 00:15:15,735
and because of the humanitarian
nature of the request

260
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:17,307
we've agreed.

261
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:21,088
There will be seven convoys
headed for Pentath III

262
00:15:21,127 --> 00:15:22,187
in the next week.

263
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,634
Each of them protected
by a Federation starship.

264
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:27,940
The <i>Defiant</i> has been assigned
to escort convoy six

265
00:15:27,978 --> 00:15:30,416
and I've chosen you
to be in command.

266
00:15:30,485 --> 00:15:34,656
Why did you select Worf
for this mission?

267
00:15:34,696 --> 00:15:38,068
I felt that he was
an experienced officer

268
00:15:38,106 --> 00:15:42,447
who was ready to take on
greater responsibilities.

269
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,076
He had a distinguished record

270
00:15:44,121 --> 00:15:46,559
and obviously understood
the Klingons.

271
00:15:46,594 --> 00:15:49,796
Weren't you a little worried,
Captain, that Worf...

272
00:15:49,835 --> 00:15:51,965
a famed Klingon warrior...

273
00:15:52,008 --> 00:15:54,378
might jump at the chance
for combat

274
00:15:54,414 --> 00:15:56,978
and forget about
the plague victims?

275
00:15:57,021 --> 00:15:59,721
If I were, I wouldn't
have given him the assignment.

276
00:15:59,761 --> 00:16:02,667
And you're sure you
made your instructions

277
00:16:02,702 --> 00:16:05,300
perfectly clear...
that Commander Worf

278
00:16:05,342 --> 00:16:07,974
knew he was
on a humanitarian relief mission

279
00:16:08,016 --> 00:16:11,218
that he was not being
sent out to seek combat?

280
00:16:11,258 --> 00:16:12,318
Yes.

281
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,329
Thank you, Captain.

282
00:16:13,363 --> 00:16:14,923
I have nothing further for you.

283
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:20,477
Captain, since you are
also acting as defense counsel

284
00:16:20,582 --> 00:16:23,180
if you wish to add anything
to the record

285
00:16:23,223 --> 00:16:24,955
you're free to do so.

286
00:16:24,993 --> 00:16:26,793
Not at this time, Admiral.

287
00:16:26,831 --> 00:16:29,269
Call your next witness.

288
00:16:29,304 --> 00:16:31,902
It was about 1700 hours.

289
00:16:31,945 --> 00:16:33,882
I was doing some cleanup work.

290
00:16:33,917 --> 00:16:37,187
Dr. Bashir was at the bar
talking to Etheria

291
00:16:37,225 --> 00:16:38,785
one of the dabo girls.

292
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,804
Have you ever seen
the wormhole open?

293
00:16:41,837 --> 00:16:42,931
No, wait.

294
00:16:42,973 --> 00:16:45,001
It wasn't Etheria;
it was Glidia.

295
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:49,149
Have you ever seen
the wormhole open?

296
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:53,826
Or was it... Midia?

297
00:16:53,869 --> 00:16:56,307
Mr. Quark, is this necess?

298
00:16:56,342 --> 00:17:01,310
No, no. No, it was Ralidia,
and she was with Morn

299
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:04,352
and he was the one
who turned to her and said...

300
00:17:04,395 --> 00:17:07,665
Can we get back
to the matter at hand, please?

301
00:17:07,705 --> 00:17:09,403
Oh, right.

302
00:17:09,442 --> 00:17:11,538
Um... well, as I said

303
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:14,212
I was cleaning up,
and I saw Mr. Worf come in.

304
00:17:14,254 --> 00:17:18,128
Was there anything unusual
about that?

305
00:17:18,164 --> 00:17:20,762
No. He comes in here
all the time.

306
00:17:20,805 --> 00:17:24,474
But he was in a good mood.

307
00:17:24,515 --> 00:17:25,677
And that's unusual?

308
00:17:25,717 --> 00:17:27,585
Well, he's a Klingon

309
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:31,028
and you people are rarely
in what I would call good moods

310
00:17:31,065 --> 00:17:36,740
not that you're anything
but a pleasant, charming race.

311
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,014
Let's get back to Mr. Worf.

312
00:17:39,053 --> 00:17:40,717
Describe what happened next.

313
00:17:40,756 --> 00:17:45,599
He came in, he ordered a drink...
prune juice, I believe...

314
00:17:45,636 --> 00:17:47,539
and we started to talk.

315
00:17:47,574 --> 00:17:50,639
I'd heard
about the convoy mission

316
00:17:50,749 --> 00:17:52,241
so I asked him about it

317
00:17:52,287 --> 00:17:55,820
and he said he was going
to be commanding the <i>Defiant.</i>

318
00:17:55,863 --> 00:17:57,423
What was his attitude?

319
00:17:59,906 --> 00:18:01,170
Hard to say.

320
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,514
He's a very private man.

321
00:18:04,552 --> 00:18:07,424
He doesn't share a lot
with his bartender.

322
00:18:07,459 --> 00:18:09,521
Did he seem...

323
00:18:09,565 --> 00:18:11,867
afraid of the mission?

324
00:18:11,904 --> 00:18:13,636
No.

325
00:18:13,742 --> 00:18:15,645
Did he seem excited
by the mission?

326
00:18:15,747 --> 00:18:19,348
Not excited exactly.

327
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,658
Then what exactly?

328
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:24,362
I just remember asking him...

329
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:28,345
What happens if the Klingons
go after the convoy?

330
00:18:28,381 --> 00:18:31,412
And then he got this
funny look on his face.

331
00:18:31,454 --> 00:18:33,118
He put down his prune juice

332
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:36,692
looked me right in the eye,
and then he said...

333
00:18:36,802 --> 00:18:39,502
I hope they do.

334
00:18:39,542 --> 00:18:41,274
"I hope they do."

335
00:18:41,314 --> 00:18:43,548
Well, it would appear

336
00:18:43,587 --> 00:18:45,744
Commander Worf's hopes
were answered.

337
00:18:45,878 --> 00:18:47,906
I have nothing further.

338
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,136
What do you have
for me, Constable?

339
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:01,811
Background on
the Klingon transport captain.

340
00:19:01,853 --> 00:19:03,756
He'd never been in the military

341
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,557
and he was known
to his family and friends

342
00:19:05,596 --> 00:19:08,627
as a quiet, efficient man
who was content in his position.

343
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,664
Doesn't sound like a man

344
00:19:10,709 --> 00:19:12,839
who'd suddenly decide
to take on the <i>Defiant.</i>

345
00:19:12,882 --> 00:19:14,283
No.

346
00:19:14,318 --> 00:19:17,315
What about this story of theirs
that the transport ship

347
00:19:17,393 --> 00:19:19,922
just wandered off course
into a combat area?

348
00:19:19,966 --> 00:19:22,564
I checked the flight plan
the Captain filed

349
00:19:22,606 --> 00:19:25,444
and the projected course
was near the border.

350
00:19:25,481 --> 00:19:28,922
It would have taken only a
very slight error in navigation

351
00:19:28,956 --> 00:19:31,520
for the ship to stray
into the fight.

352
00:19:31,563 --> 00:19:33,933
But why did he drop his cloak
right in front of the <i>Defiant?</i>

353
00:19:33,969 --> 00:19:36,966
Ah, that's the question
no one seems able to answer.

354
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:41,283
No one seems able,
or no one seems willing?

355
00:19:41,322 --> 00:19:42,917
Oh, they're too willing

356
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,897
to answer questions...
that's the problem.

357
00:19:44,931 --> 00:19:46,959
I'm always suspicious of people

358
00:19:47,003 --> 00:19:49,498
who are eager to help
a police officer.

359
00:19:49,543 --> 00:19:52,881
Start looking into
the passengers on that ship.

360
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:55,153
Maybe someone with a grudge
against Worf

361
00:19:55,191 --> 00:19:56,821
or the Federation was aboard...

362
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,662
someone who could have
seized control

363
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,796
of the ship and taken
it into the battle.

364
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:03,277
I'm reaching, I know.

365
00:20:03,312 --> 00:20:05,716
But at the moment,
it's all we have.

366
00:20:05,752 --> 00:20:08,020
I'll keep looking.

367
00:20:08,058 --> 00:20:09,584
There were two Klingon ships...

368
00:20:09,628 --> 00:20:11,656
a bird-of-prey
and an old battle cruiser.

369
00:20:11,701 --> 00:20:14,435
One would engage us while
the other went after the convoy.

370
00:20:14,474 --> 00:20:15,636
Then they'd switch.

371
00:20:15,677 --> 00:20:17,705
The first ship going
after the Cardassians

372
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:19,549
while the second ship
came after us.

373
00:20:24,066 --> 00:20:26,664
We've lost the number three
starboard shield.

374
00:20:26,706 --> 00:20:27,970
Come about.

375
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,505
The cruiser has taken us
too far away from the convoy.

376
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,713
Try to keep our port side
to the Klingons.

377
00:20:32,755 --> 00:20:34,054
Aye, sir.

378
00:20:34,092 --> 00:20:37,864
This went on for... I don't know,
maybe five minutes.

379
00:20:37,901 --> 00:20:40,305
They'd come at us, try to draw
us away from the Cardassians.

380
00:20:40,341 --> 00:20:41,674
We'd head back.

381
00:20:41,712 --> 00:20:44,618
Then the bird-of-prey came
toward us off the port bow.

382
00:20:48,663 --> 00:20:49,893
I have phaser lock.

383
00:20:49,933 --> 00:20:51,334
Fire.

384
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,010
We damaged them but not much.

385
00:20:57,051 --> 00:20:59,923
We'd seen them do this cloak-
and-run maneuver a few times

386
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:01,987
and Commander Worf
thought he saw a pattern.

387
00:21:02,031 --> 00:21:04,265
We have them now.

388
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,708
Come to course 185 mark 278.

389
00:21:06,744 --> 00:21:08,874
Stand by quantum
torpedoes, full spread.

390
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,146
Aye, sir.

391
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:13,354
I ran a quick sensor sweep
then I reported.

392
00:21:13,394 --> 00:21:15,764
I'm picking up a tachyon surge
directly ahead.

393
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,791
Fire.

394
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:24,248
When did you realize
it wasn't a bird-of-prey?

395
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:25,987
As soon as it exploded.

396
00:21:26,026 --> 00:21:27,427
Oh, my God.

397
00:21:27,464 --> 00:21:29,094
We were all stunned.

398
00:21:29,134 --> 00:21:31,902
I scanned for survivors,
but there were none.

399
00:21:31,942 --> 00:21:34,038
Chief, do you believe

400
00:21:34,081 --> 00:21:36,576
Worf was correct
in giving the order to fire?

401
00:21:36,621 --> 00:21:38,615
I stand by his decision.

402
00:21:38,727 --> 00:21:41,997
Is there any question
in your mind about his motives?

403
00:21:42,035 --> 00:21:43,436
No, sir.

404
00:21:43,472 --> 00:21:46,640
I've known Commander Worf
for nine years.

405
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,412
He's an honorable man.

406
00:21:48,451 --> 00:21:51,049
He would never intentionally
fire on an unarmed ship.

407
00:21:51,091 --> 00:21:52,583
Thank you, Chief.

408
00:21:58,009 --> 00:22:00,311
I'm curious, Chief.

409
00:22:00,349 --> 00:22:04,314
You say you stand by
Commander Worf's decision.

410
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,852
Do you agree with it?

411
00:22:05,897 --> 00:22:08,837
I completely support him.

412
00:22:08,871 --> 00:22:10,535
That's not my question.

413
00:22:10,576 --> 00:22:13,048
Do you agree with his decision?

414
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,385
I wasn't in command.

415
00:22:15,421 --> 00:22:18,223
It's not my place
to question his judgment.

416
00:22:18,262 --> 00:22:19,994
What if you were in command?

417
00:22:20,034 --> 00:22:21,594
What would you have done?

418
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,544
I don't know.

419
00:22:25,581 --> 00:22:29,957
Chief, how many years have
you been in Starfleet?

420
00:22:29,993 --> 00:22:31,394
Twenty-two.

421
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:34,427
And how many combat
situations have you been in?

422
00:22:34,471 --> 00:22:36,966
I couldn't even guess.

423
00:22:37,011 --> 00:22:38,344
Try.

424
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:41,851
100, 150.

425
00:22:41,891 --> 00:22:43,292
For the record

426
00:22:43,327 --> 00:22:47,099
Chief O'Brien has been
in 235 separate engagements

427
00:22:47,137 --> 00:22:50,635
and Starfleet
has decorated him 15 times.

428
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,654
I would like to have him
declared an expert

429
00:22:53,687 --> 00:22:55,749
in the area of starship combat.

430
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,420
Any objection?

431
00:22:57,464 --> 00:22:59,732
None.

432
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:04,477
Chief O'Brien,
if Mr. Worf had been injured

433
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:07,422
could you have taken over
command of that ship?

434
00:23:07,456 --> 00:23:09,188
I would have.

435
00:23:09,228 --> 00:23:11,131
Let's say that happened.

436
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:13,330
You're in command.

437
00:23:13,372 --> 00:23:16,004
You're chasing the bird-of-prey.

438
00:23:16,045 --> 00:23:17,014
It cloaks.

439
00:23:17,048 --> 00:23:19,247
You anticipate
your opponent's maneuver

440
00:23:19,287 --> 00:23:21,657
so you give the order.

441
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:24,029
Come about to 185 mark 278.

442
00:23:24,066 --> 00:23:27,199
Stand by quantum torpedoes,
full spread.

443
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:28,676
The crew obeys.

444
00:23:28,711 --> 00:23:30,078
The ship comes about.

445
00:23:30,116 --> 00:23:32,554
And then your helm officer
tells you...

446
00:23:32,589 --> 00:23:35,461
I'm picking up a tachyon surge,
directly ahead.

447
00:23:35,496 --> 00:23:36,658
Now, stop right there.

448
00:23:36,699 --> 00:23:38,567
Freeze that moment in time.

449
00:23:38,604 --> 00:23:41,304
Everything rides
on your next decision.

450
00:23:41,345 --> 00:23:43,817
Do you give the order to fire?

451
00:23:43,851 --> 00:23:45,583
This isn't a fair question.

452
00:23:45,622 --> 00:23:47,320
It didn't really happen
this way.

453
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,331
I wasn't in command.

454
00:23:49,365 --> 00:23:51,097
I'm not interested
in whether you think

455
00:23:51,136 --> 00:23:52,298
it's a fair question or not.

456
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,935
You're in command.

457
00:23:53,978 --> 00:23:56,074
There's a ship out there
de-cloaking.

458
00:23:56,116 --> 00:23:57,984
You don't know what it is.

459
00:23:58,021 --> 00:23:59,547
Do you fire?

460
00:24:07,178 --> 00:24:08,442
No.

461
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,753
But that's just my opinion now,
after the fact.

462
00:24:13,795 --> 00:24:16,529
I wasn't in command that day.

463
00:24:16,569 --> 00:24:20,204
Things look a lot different when
you're sitting in that chair.

464
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:27,731
I'm sure they do.

465
00:24:48,151 --> 00:24:50,019
Captain Sisko

466
00:24:50,056 --> 00:24:53,360
mind if I sit down?

467
00:25:03,157 --> 00:25:05,253
I understand
you're going to put Worf

468
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:06,891
on the stand this afternoon.

469
00:25:06,933 --> 00:25:08,528
That's right.

470
00:25:08,571 --> 00:25:10,131
May I make a suggestion?

471
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:13,845
Concede.

472
00:25:13,884 --> 00:25:16,356
Let me take him back
to the Empire

473
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:18,453
and I'll make sure
he's not put to death.

474
00:25:18,497 --> 00:25:21,494
In fact, I'll defend him myself.

475
00:25:21,538 --> 00:25:22,598
You?

476
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,802
What matters to me

477
00:25:23,844 --> 00:25:27,377
is the thrill of the fight,
not which side I'm on.

478
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:31,659
And I think we both know
the extradition fight is over.

479
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:34,296
You're not making
this offer out of kindness.

480
00:25:34,338 --> 00:25:36,502
You want the Federation
to concede

481
00:25:36,544 --> 00:25:38,447
so the convoys will stop

482
00:25:38,482 --> 00:25:42,926
and the Klingons can move in
on the Pentath system.

483
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,909
As humans would say,
that would be icing on the cake.

484
00:25:48,942 --> 00:25:53,819
I wouldn't try eating that cake
just yet, if I were you.

485
00:25:56,061 --> 00:25:59,433
But you have told me one thing
I needed to know...

486
00:26:01,609 --> 00:26:05,419
you're worried about what Worf
might say on the stand.

487
00:26:05,552 --> 00:26:10,793
I'm not worried,
but you should be.

488
00:26:26,741 --> 00:26:28,905
Captain.

489
00:26:32,422 --> 00:26:33,948
Good news or bad?

490
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:36,966
Bad. I checked the backgrounds

491
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,766
of every passenger
on that transport.

492
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,605
None had any connection
with Worf

493
00:26:40,677 --> 00:26:42,807
or grudge against the Federation

494
00:26:42,848 --> 00:26:45,754
or any motive
for seizing control

495
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,954
of the ship
and attacking the <i>Defiant.</i>

496
00:26:47,996 --> 00:26:50,126
But I'm still not giving up.

497
00:26:50,168 --> 00:26:52,402
I appreciate that

498
00:26:52,441 --> 00:26:54,537
but I get the feeling
that at this point

499
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:58,077
the only one who can
help Worf is Worf.

500
00:27:08,448 --> 00:27:11,182
The escort mission had
proceeded smoothly for two days.

501
00:27:11,223 --> 00:27:13,457
We detected
several subspace distortions

502
00:27:13,495 --> 00:27:15,021
which might have been
cloaked ships

503
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:16,535
but nothing definite.

504
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:19,337
So, what was the first sign
of trouble, Mr. Worf?

505
00:27:20,881 --> 00:27:22,350
There was no warning.

506
00:27:23,689 --> 00:27:26,754
A bird-of-prey just de-cloaked
off the port quarter.

507
00:27:26,797 --> 00:27:29,395
Raise shields.
Arm phasers.

508
00:27:29,437 --> 00:27:31,875
Commander, another
ship's de-cloaking.

509
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,505
It's an older battle cruiser.

510
00:27:33,547 --> 00:27:36,019
She's going after the convoy.

511
00:27:36,053 --> 00:27:38,685
Bring us about.

512
00:27:38,728 --> 00:27:41,702
How did you feel
when the Klingons attacked?

513
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:43,637
Were you excited?

514
00:27:43,674 --> 00:27:44,870
Of course.

515
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,436
I am a Klingon.

516
00:27:46,481 --> 00:27:48,145
We live for battle.

517
00:27:48,185 --> 00:27:50,088
So that's all
that mattered to you...

518
00:27:50,124 --> 00:27:51,320
the chance to fight?

519
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,097
No, sir. Whatever
my personal feelings may be

520
00:27:55,137 --> 00:27:58,202
I do not allow them
to interfere with my duty

521
00:27:58,245 --> 00:27:59,737
or my professional judgment.

522
00:27:59,848 --> 00:28:01,944
Chief O'Brien says
that he disagrees

523
00:28:01,988 --> 00:28:03,686
with your decision to fire.

524
00:28:03,726 --> 00:28:06,528
How do you respond to that?

525
00:28:06,566 --> 00:28:08,366
I respect the Chief's opinion.

526
00:28:08,404 --> 00:28:10,638
He and I have served together
for many years

527
00:28:10,677 --> 00:28:12,443
and I consider him a friend.

528
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:15,148
However, he was not
in command that day.

529
00:28:15,189 --> 00:28:16,715
What difference does that make?

530
00:28:16,827 --> 00:28:18,855
It makes all the difference.

531
00:28:18,898 --> 00:28:20,994
He is looking back at a decision

532
00:28:21,037 --> 00:28:22,735
analyzing it weeks later.

533
00:28:22,775 --> 00:28:24,939
As the Commanding Officer
of the <i>Defiant</i>

534
00:28:24,981 --> 00:28:26,747
it was my duty to look forward

535
00:28:26,785 --> 00:28:29,280
to anticipate
every possible situation.

536
00:28:29,326 --> 00:28:30,454
Did you anticipate

537
00:28:30,494 --> 00:28:34,300
encountering a civilian ship
on this mission?

538
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:36,777
I knew our convoy
would be passing

539
00:28:36,879 --> 00:28:38,679
through civilian
shipping lanes, but...

540
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,451
in my judgment, the chances
of a civilian vessel

541
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:44,794
de-cloaking in the middle
of a battle were remote.

542
00:28:44,832 --> 00:28:47,897
I decided that if I were
engaged in combat

543
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,778
I would not hesitate
to fire at a de-cloaking ship.

544
00:28:50,814 --> 00:28:53,720
Mr. Worf, I want you to think

545
00:28:53,756 --> 00:28:57,459
about the civilians who died
on that transport ship

546
00:28:57,499 --> 00:28:59,835
and answer one question.

547
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:03,073
Under the same set
of circumstances

548
00:29:03,113 --> 00:29:04,639
would you do it again?

549
00:29:08,193 --> 00:29:09,560
Yes, sir.

550
00:29:09,596 --> 00:29:12,536
If I had hesitated,
I would have been negligent.

551
00:29:12,571 --> 00:29:15,009
I would have been risking
my ship, my crew

552
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,639
and the entire convoy.

553
00:29:19,656 --> 00:29:21,718
Thank you.

554
00:29:23,666 --> 00:29:25,603
Worf...

555
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:30,275
why are you considered
an outcast among Klingons?

556
00:29:30,317 --> 00:29:32,254
I sided with the Federation

557
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:34,316
during the invasion
of Cardassia.

558
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,331
For that, Chancellor Gowron

559
00:29:36,366 --> 00:29:39,670
stripped me of my name
and my family honor.

560
00:29:39,708 --> 00:29:42,614
So you acted out of conscience
and you were punished for it.

561
00:29:42,649 --> 00:29:45,247
How do you feel about that?

562
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:47,226
Angry? Bitter?

563
00:29:47,261 --> 00:29:50,998
I am angry about the treatment
I have received.

564
00:29:51,037 --> 00:29:53,669
I felt it was unjust.

565
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,442
Of course you are.

566
00:29:55,482 --> 00:29:56,644
Who wouldn't be?

567
00:29:56,685 --> 00:29:59,214
What happened affected
your entire family.

568
00:29:59,258 --> 00:30:01,753
The House of Mogh
was brought down.

569
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:03,564
Your brother was ejected

570
00:30:03,603 --> 00:30:05,767
from the High Council
in disgrace

571
00:30:05,809 --> 00:30:07,609
your lands seized

572
00:30:07,647 --> 00:30:11,111
and now your son, Alexander,
has to bear the stigma

573
00:30:11,156 --> 00:30:13,492
of being the son of a traitor.

574
00:30:13,529 --> 00:30:15,363
Did I miss anything?

575
00:30:16,336 --> 00:30:17,805
No.

576
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,366
In your opinion

577
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,905
what do they think of you
in the Empire, Worf?

578
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,716
I am hated.

579
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,623
Why?
Because of what you did?

580
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,651
Yes.

581
00:30:26,696 --> 00:30:29,294
Are you sure
it's not something more basic?

582
00:30:30,506 --> 00:30:32,443
What is that supposed to mean?

583
00:30:34,183 --> 00:30:36,017
Isn't it obvious?

584
00:30:38,226 --> 00:30:40,425
You were raised by humans

585
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:42,733
on Earth

586
00:30:42,772 --> 00:30:45,574
and now you wear their uniform.

587
00:30:45,612 --> 00:30:50,056
Haven't you really always been
a traitor in your heart?

588
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:51,150
No.

589
00:30:51,193 --> 00:30:52,423
Are you telling us

590
00:30:52,463 --> 00:30:55,733
that you live with humans,
but your heart is Klingon?

591
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:56,899
Yes.

592
00:30:56,941 --> 00:30:59,071
But if your heart is Klingon

593
00:30:59,147 --> 00:31:01,311
how could you fire
upon your own people?

594
00:31:01,353 --> 00:31:03,187
They fired the first shot.

595
00:31:03,224 --> 00:31:05,890
And when that happened,
they became my enemies.

596
00:31:05,932 --> 00:31:08,770
Then why aren't you glad you
destroyed that transport?

597
00:31:08,805 --> 00:31:11,471
It was filled with your
enemies and their children.

598
00:31:11,513 --> 00:31:13,347
There is nothing honorable

599
00:31:13,385 --> 00:31:15,949
about killing those
who cannot defend themselves.

600
00:31:15,991 --> 00:31:21,164
Are you telling me
that you would never

601
00:31:21,204 --> 00:31:24,508
attack a defenseless opponent?

602
00:31:24,546 --> 00:31:27,212
No. I would not.

603
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,864
Maybe I was wrong about you.

604
00:31:34,907 --> 00:31:39,214
Maybe you aren't really
Klingon in your heart.

605
00:31:39,251 --> 00:31:42,852
A true Klingon rejoices
at the death of his enemies...

606
00:31:42,894 --> 00:31:45,298
old, young, armed, unarmed.

607
00:31:45,334 --> 00:31:48,136
All that matters is the victory.

608
00:31:48,174 --> 00:31:49,838
Tell me, Worf...

609
00:31:49,879 --> 00:31:53,081
did you weep for those children?

610
00:31:56,697 --> 00:31:58,292
I grieve for them.

611
00:31:58,334 --> 00:31:59,564
Grieve for them?

612
00:31:59,604 --> 00:32:01,803
A Klingon does not grieve.

613
00:32:01,843 --> 00:32:03,837
They died in glorious battle.

614
00:32:03,882 --> 00:32:06,116
They are with the honored dead
in <i>Sto-Vo-Kor.</i>

615
00:32:06,155 --> 00:32:07,887
They do not want your grief.

616
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,327
You dishonor their memory.

617
00:32:09,363 --> 00:32:10,559
Objection.

618
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:12,125
Advocate.

619
00:32:12,171 --> 00:32:13,470
You will say anything.

620
00:32:13,507 --> 00:32:15,637
You have no honor.

621
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,981
I say this...
you live with humans

622
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,651
because you're afraid
to live with Klingons.

623
00:32:20,692 --> 00:32:22,629
I fear nothing

624
00:32:22,664 --> 00:32:24,726
and if you would like
to pick up a <i>bat'leth</i>

625
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:26,832
and face me with weapons
instead of words

626
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:28,174
I will prove it to you.

627
00:32:28,278 --> 00:32:29,713
You'd like that,
wouldn't you, Worf?

628
00:32:29,749 --> 00:32:31,583
You'd love to prove
that you are as strong

629
00:32:31,621 --> 00:32:33,455
and courageous
as any Klingon warrior.

630
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,589
I am a Klingon warrior.

631
00:32:35,631 --> 00:32:37,295
Advocate, you are stepping

632
00:32:37,336 --> 00:32:39,307
well beyond
the bounds of protocol.

633
00:32:39,341 --> 00:32:41,107
And that is why
you told the Ferengi

634
00:32:41,145 --> 00:32:42,877
you hope the Klingons
do come for you.

635
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:45,583
You wanted to prove
yourself in the eyes

636
00:32:45,624 --> 00:32:47,093
of the only people
that matter to you...

637
00:32:47,127 --> 00:32:48,722
other Klingons!

638
00:32:48,765 --> 00:32:52,137
This will stop, or I will hold
both of you in contempt.

639
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:56,842
I apologize, Worf.

640
00:32:59,693 --> 00:33:01,755
Actually...

641
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:03,531
I pity you.

642
00:33:03,571 --> 00:33:06,836
But the person I pity most
is Alexander...

643
00:33:06,969 --> 00:33:11,242
because one day,
he will come to you and ask

644
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:14,083
"Father, who am I?"

645
00:33:14,121 --> 00:33:15,921
And you will have to tell him

646
00:33:15,959 --> 00:33:19,628
that he is the son
of a small, frightened man

647
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:22,541
who destroyed
a ship full of children

648
00:33:22,576 --> 00:33:24,775
just to prove his own courage.

649
00:33:24,883 --> 00:33:26,443
Worf, no!

650
00:33:37,984 --> 00:33:44,422
I thought you told me you'd
never attack an unarmed man.

651
00:33:47,475 --> 00:33:49,845
Perhaps you should have said

652
00:33:49,914 --> 00:33:52,044
"not unless I get angry."

653
00:33:54,058 --> 00:33:58,969
"Not unless I have
something to prove."

654
00:33:59,004 --> 00:34:00,941
I rest my case.

655
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:22,186
Captain's Log, Stardate 49665.3.

656
00:34:22,231 --> 00:34:25,033
The hearing is in recess
and Admiral T'Lara

657
00:34:25,072 --> 00:34:28,274
has retired to her quarters
to begin deliberations.

658
00:34:28,314 --> 00:34:31,152
I wish I could be more
optimistic about her decision.

659
00:34:32,758 --> 00:34:34,159
Constable.

660
00:34:35,465 --> 00:34:37,025
Good news.

661
00:35:02,135 --> 00:35:03,570
Captain Sisko.

662
00:35:03,605 --> 00:35:06,203
Admiral, I apologize

663
00:35:06,246 --> 00:35:08,240
for interrupting
your deliberations

664
00:35:08,284 --> 00:35:11,018
but I have some new evidence
I'd like to present.

665
00:35:11,058 --> 00:35:12,926
Very well.

666
00:35:12,963 --> 00:35:17,670
I'd like Advocate Ch'Pok
to evaluate the evidence

667
00:35:17,709 --> 00:35:20,615
as an expert witness
on the Klingon Empire.

668
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:24,251
I will not compel you
to testify, Advocate.

669
00:35:29,038 --> 00:35:31,032
Care to step
onto my battlefield?

670
00:35:42,439 --> 00:35:47,110
Advocate, how would you describe
the current relationship

671
00:35:47,152 --> 00:35:49,886
between the Federation
and the Klingon Empire?

672
00:35:49,925 --> 00:35:54,028
There is no formal relationship
between our two governments.

673
00:35:54,103 --> 00:35:56,040
What would you call us?

674
00:35:56,108 --> 00:35:59,412
Informal friends?
Informal enemies?

675
00:35:59,451 --> 00:36:00,420
I would say

676
00:36:00,453 --> 00:36:03,153
there is potential
for either label.

677
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:06,430
But at the moment,
neither is entirely accurate.

678
00:36:06,469 --> 00:36:08,303
Hmm, interesting.

679
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,004
Would you agree that,
at the moment

680
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:12,880
it is difficult for us
to trust each other?

681
00:36:12,918 --> 00:36:15,756
Difficult, but not impossible.

682
00:36:15,793 --> 00:36:18,961
There are things that transcend
our differences.

683
00:36:19,001 --> 00:36:22,203
For example, we trust
that this case

684
00:36:22,243 --> 00:36:23,803
can be decided fairly.

685
00:36:23,847 --> 00:36:27,482
We have faith
in Admiral T'Lara's judgment.

686
00:36:27,523 --> 00:36:29,585
Oh, I'm glad to hear you have

687
00:36:29,629 --> 00:36:33,503
such a profound respect
for the Admiral.

688
00:36:33,539 --> 00:36:37,983
But would it be fair to say
that outside this hearing

689
00:36:38,017 --> 00:36:41,082
you do not entirely trust us?

690
00:36:41,192 --> 00:36:46,969
Well, it is only prudent
that we question your motives

691
00:36:47,007 --> 00:36:49,206
now that we are
no longer allies.

692
00:36:49,246 --> 00:36:51,342
Of course, and it is only

693
00:36:51,385 --> 00:36:53,584
prudent of us
to question your motives.

694
00:36:53,624 --> 00:36:55,219
After all, aren't there times

695
00:36:55,262 --> 00:36:59,763
when you feel it's in your
best interest to deceive us?

696
00:36:59,807 --> 00:37:02,371
I object to the question.

697
00:37:02,413 --> 00:37:04,977
It is vague and hypothetical.

698
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,957
Well, can you imagine
any circumstance

699
00:37:06,992 --> 00:37:10,934
in which the Empire
would deceive the Federation?

700
00:37:10,969 --> 00:37:13,909
I have a poor imagination.

701
00:37:13,944 --> 00:37:17,316
Let's see what we
can do to spark it.

702
00:37:18,656 --> 00:37:21,596
Do you recognize these names?

703
00:37:25,139 --> 00:37:28,113
These are the people who were
killed on board the transport.

704
00:37:28,147 --> 00:37:29,582
You're positive?

705
00:37:29,618 --> 00:37:32,717
There are 441 of them.

706
00:37:32,759 --> 00:37:35,597
The names and faces
of these people

707
00:37:35,633 --> 00:37:37,832
are seared into my heart.

708
00:37:37,872 --> 00:37:39,866
This is a list of heroes

709
00:37:39,911 --> 00:37:42,075
who died at the hands
of a coward.

710
00:37:42,117 --> 00:37:45,114
It is a list I can never forget.

711
00:37:45,157 --> 00:37:49,190
They are an interesting group
of people, aren't they?

712
00:37:49,235 --> 00:37:51,138
From every walk of life...

713
00:37:51,173 --> 00:37:55,810
merchants, soldiers,
artists, shopkeepers...

714
00:37:55,853 --> 00:37:59,920
- Children.
- Children.

715
00:37:59,963 --> 00:38:03,427
We've done some checking
in their backgrounds

716
00:38:03,472 --> 00:38:04,964
and in our opinion

717
00:38:05,009 --> 00:38:07,311
they all appear to be
a random group of people

718
00:38:07,349 --> 00:38:09,844
who shared only one thing
in common:

719
00:38:09,889 --> 00:38:13,022
They all traveled
on the same ship.

720
00:38:13,064 --> 00:38:15,194
Is that your conclusion as well?

721
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:16,796
Yes.

722
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,039
And it was just fate

723
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:23,524
that led these particular people
to board a doomed ship?

724
00:38:23,558 --> 00:38:27,227
Fate is a human concept.

725
00:38:27,301 --> 00:38:32,178
They simply boarded the wrong
ship at the wrong time.

726
00:38:32,214 --> 00:38:35,052
And then... they did it again.

727
00:38:36,525 --> 00:38:39,590
I don't, uh...
think I understand

728
00:38:39,632 --> 00:38:41,192
your line of...

729
00:38:41,237 --> 00:38:42,797
Three months ago

730
00:38:42,841 --> 00:38:45,643
a Klingon transport ship
crashed

731
00:38:45,681 --> 00:38:47,675
in the mountains
of Galorda Prime.

732
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,714
Of course, everyone
assumed the worst...

733
00:38:49,759 --> 00:38:52,699
that the passengers and the crew
had all been killed.

734
00:38:52,733 --> 00:38:55,297
But then, miraculously...

735
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:58,142
everyone survived.

736
00:38:58,181 --> 00:39:01,053
Do you know anyone
who was on that ship?

737
00:39:03,327 --> 00:39:04,660
No.

738
00:39:04,698 --> 00:39:06,133
Are you sure?

739
00:39:06,168 --> 00:39:09,301
You have the names
of the survivors right there.

740
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:16,493
I can understand your confusion.

741
00:39:16,528 --> 00:39:19,832
The names in front of you
are identical

742
00:39:19,871 --> 00:39:23,004
to the names on this list.

743
00:39:23,045 --> 00:39:26,543
The people who were killed
in the <i>Defiant</i> incident.

744
00:39:26,587 --> 00:39:30,028
So what does this mean?

745
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:37,747
441 people somehow survived
a crash on Galorda Prime.

746
00:39:37,783 --> 00:39:39,720
And then a few weeks later

747
00:39:39,756 --> 00:39:44,325
they all decide to take
another trip on the same day

748
00:39:44,367 --> 00:39:48,504
on the same transport ship,
under the same Captain and crew.

749
00:39:48,545 --> 00:39:50,516
And then that ship
is destroyed, too.

750
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:55,825
This is a very unlucky group
of people, wouldn't you say?

751
00:39:55,863 --> 00:40:00,364
I am not an expert on luck.

752
00:40:00,409 --> 00:40:04,716
No. You are an expert
on the Klingon Empire.

753
00:40:04,753 --> 00:40:08,159
So, tell me, Advocate

754
00:40:08,196 --> 00:40:11,295
isn't it possible
that there were no civilians

755
00:40:11,337 --> 00:40:13,605
on the transport Worf destroyed?

756
00:40:13,643 --> 00:40:16,674
Isn't it possible
that the ship he saw

757
00:40:16,718 --> 00:40:19,418
was sending out
false sensor images

758
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:21,930
and that this whole affair
was staged

759
00:40:21,965 --> 00:40:24,837
so that the only Klingon
officer in Starfleet

760
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:27,100
would be accused of a massacre,
and the Federation

761
00:40:27,142 --> 00:40:30,777
would be forced to stop
escorting the convoys?

762
00:40:30,818 --> 00:40:34,590
Tell me, Advocate...

763
00:40:36,099 --> 00:40:40,041
isn't it possible?

764
00:40:44,721 --> 00:40:46,783
Yes.

765
00:41:04,272 --> 00:41:06,402
Captain.

766
00:41:06,444 --> 00:41:08,004
I thought you should know

767
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:10,851
O'Brien and Bashir are throwing
a party for you at Quark's.

768
00:41:10,889 --> 00:41:12,951
Looks like quite a bash.

769
00:41:12,994 --> 00:41:14,862
I am aware of it.

770
00:41:14,967 --> 00:41:17,531
But I have much on my mind.

771
00:41:17,573 --> 00:41:19,476
Ch'Pok was right.

772
00:41:19,512 --> 00:41:21,449
I did have something to prove

773
00:41:21,483 --> 00:41:23,785
when I took command
of the convoy.

774
00:41:23,823 --> 00:41:26,625
And I did not realize it

775
00:41:26,663 --> 00:41:30,161
until I stood there,
looking down at him

776
00:41:30,206 --> 00:41:33,237
blood trickling from his mouth.

777
00:41:33,281 --> 00:41:35,879
In that moment,
I remember thinking

778
00:41:35,921 --> 00:41:39,157
finally, he had given me
what I really wanted...

779
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:42,295
a reason to attack him.

780
00:41:42,337 --> 00:41:44,605
And I had that same feeling

781
00:41:44,643 --> 00:41:46,705
when the Klingon ships
first attacked.

782
00:41:46,748 --> 00:41:50,622
Finally, a chance for vengeance.

783
00:41:54,068 --> 00:41:56,472
I should not have
accepted the mission.

784
00:41:56,508 --> 00:41:59,140
I am glad you realize that.

785
00:42:04,629 --> 00:42:06,897
That was your first mistake.

786
00:42:06,935 --> 00:42:08,769
What was your second?

787
00:42:10,845 --> 00:42:12,782
When the ship de-cloaked

788
00:42:12,816 --> 00:42:15,050
I should have checked
the target before I fired.

789
00:42:15,089 --> 00:42:17,117
You're damned right
you should have checked.

790
00:42:17,161 --> 00:42:19,325
You knew there were
civilian ships in the area.

791
00:42:19,366 --> 00:42:21,895
You fired at something
you hadn't identified.

792
00:42:26,251 --> 00:42:31,664
You made a military decision
to protect your ship and crew.

793
00:42:31,699 --> 00:42:34,867
But you're
a Starfleet officer, Worf.

794
00:42:34,907 --> 00:42:38,006
We don't put civilians at risk,
or even potentially at risk

795
00:42:38,048 --> 00:42:40,019
to save ourselves.

796
00:42:40,088 --> 00:42:42,458
Sometimes that means
we lose the battle

797
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:44,965
and sometimes our lives.

798
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,906
But if you can't make
that choice

799
00:42:47,941 --> 00:42:51,439
then you can't wear
that uniform.

800
00:42:51,484 --> 00:42:53,888
Yes, sir.

801
00:42:53,923 --> 00:42:55,689
At ease, Commander.

802
00:42:59,438 --> 00:43:02,708
Now, all that being true

803
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:05,480
the reality is
no harm's been done.

804
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,553
There are no dead children
on your conscience.

805
00:43:09,597 --> 00:43:10,964
You got lucky.

806
00:43:13,207 --> 00:43:15,839
I do not feel lucky.

807
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,409
And that's why, despite
everything that's happened

808
00:43:18,454 --> 00:43:21,952
you're going to make
a hell of a Captain someday.

809
00:43:21,996 --> 00:43:23,465
Now, let's go.

810
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,491
They'll all be waiting.

811
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:32,951
Look, this party isn't for you
as much as it is for them.

812
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:35,623
Things got a little tense
there for a while.

813
00:43:35,664 --> 00:43:37,692
They need a release,
a chance to celebrate.

814
00:43:38,739 --> 00:43:41,941
But I do not feel
like celebrating.

815
00:43:41,981 --> 00:43:45,251
Part of being a Captain
is knowing when to smile.

816
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:47,922
Make the troops happy...
even when it's

817
00:43:47,963 --> 00:43:50,458
the last thing in the world
you want to do.

818
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:52,771
Because they're your troops

819
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:55,841
and you have
to take care of them.

820
00:43:58,023 --> 00:44:02,090
Life is a great deal more
complicated in this red uniform.

821
00:44:02,134 --> 00:44:04,663
Wait till you get
four pips on that collar.

822
00:44:04,707 --> 00:44:08,240
You'll wish you had gone
into botany.
