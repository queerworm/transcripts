1
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:05,213
Oh. A little lower.

2
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:07,173
Lower.

3
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:09,175
Lower.

4
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:10,301
( sighs softly )

5
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:13,138
How's that?

6
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:14,556
( sighs )

7
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:18,810
ODO: Well, I hope this taught
you a lesson.

8
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:20,603
What's that?

9
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:24,441
Never play spring ball
against a changeling.

10
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,736
Well, just for that, next time,

11
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:30,613
I'm not going
to let you win a single game.

12
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:33,867
Well, then you'd better work
on your backhand.

13
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:34,826
Mm-mm.

14
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,205
Right now, all I want to do is just sleep
for two or three--

15
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,291
( gasping ) oh, oh, oh...

16
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:42,500
Days.

17
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:44,294
Go right ahead.

18
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,213
I should be back by the time you wake up.

19
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:49,257
Back? From where?

20
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:54,179
I received a coded message
from Gul Russol this morning.

21
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,056
Gul Russol.

22
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,102
I thought he was executed
when Cardassia joined the Dominion.

23
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:06,357
So did I, but apparently we were wrong.
The message says he wants to meet with me.

24
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,485
-Why?
-I don't know,

25
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,821
but he's my most reliable
Cardassian informant.

26
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:16,201
You mean he was. What if Russol is dead
and this is just a trap?

27
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,703
I've thought about that,
but I have to be sure.

28
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:20,455
I owe him that much.

29
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:26,544
-Want me to come with you?
-Russol insists I come alone.

30
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:32,342
Don't worry, Nerys.
I'll be careful.

31
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,011
Worried? Ha.

32
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:38,264
This just gives me more time to work
on my backhand.

33
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,808
( chuckles )

34
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,649
QUARK: Chief!

35
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,486
How much longer is the Promenade
going to be closed?

36
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,697
My bar is empty. My waiters are bored.

37
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,700
-And I'm losing money.
-Leave me alone, Quark,

38
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,245
or I'll feed you to one
of those plasma conductors.

39
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:03,581
-Are you threatening me?
-We're working as fast as we can.

40
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:08,503
As spokesman for the Promenade
Merchants' Association, I'm going to file

41
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:12,590
-an official protest with Captain Sisko.
-Put it in writing, Quark.

42
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,884
I'll go find a padd.

43
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:19,139
So, how much longer, Chief?

44
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,392
Well, we should be through here
by the end of the day, sir.

45
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,645
Oh, I'm not talking about the Promenade.
I'm talking about the <i>Defiant.</i>

46
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,814
When is the gravity net
going to be repaired?

47
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:31,151
The last time I stepped onto the Bridge,
I felt ten kilos heavier.

48
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:35,572
-I'm afraid it's going to take some time.
-How much time? About three weeks.

49
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,158
We have to replace
the graviton stabilizer.

50
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:41,536
You have three days. I'm going to take
the <i>Defiant </i>back out on patrol,

51
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:46,207
and I don't want my crew getting queasy
because the gravity keeps fluctuating.

52
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,209
But, sir, the Sector Quartermaster said,

53
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:51,421
it would take three weeks
to get us a new stabilizer.

54
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,214
Well, that is your problem, Chief.

55
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,675
Now, I'm leaving for Bajor
for a conference,

56
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:59,554
and I want that stabilizer replaced
by the time I get back.

57
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,014
Do I make myself clear?

58
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,390
Yes, sir.

59
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,187
I don't mean to sound negative,
but I don't see

60
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,064
how you're going to get the <i>Defiant</i>
ready in three days.

61
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,024
Neither do I.

62
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,822
This Quartermaster you've been dealing
with, what's his name?

63
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:21,784
Uh, Chief... Chief... Chief Willoughby.

64
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,370
I mean his first name. I don't know.

65
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,497
-Is he married?
-Married?

66
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:29,417
What does that have to do with getting
us a graviton stabilizer?

67
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,377
Everything. This Chief Willoughby

68
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,088
must get hundreds of supply requisitions
every day.

69
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:38,092
He can't possibly fill them all.
So he puts everyone on a waiting list.

70
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:41,387
I know how he feels.
I do the same thing.

71
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,641
Well, the secret is getting him to put you

72
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,101
at the top of that list,
and the best way to do that

73
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,270
is to form a relationship with him.

74
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:52,440
NOG: Get to know the name of his wife,
his children.

75
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,734
Find out what he likes to eat.

76
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,987
I don't have time to form
a relationship with Willoughby.

77
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:00,990
I do.

78
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,619
I can get you that stabilizer, Chief.

79
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,372
In three days? Leave everything to me.

80
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,833
All right. But don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

81
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,254
Chief, I can't operate
under those kinds of restrictions.

82
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,466
At least promise me you won't do anything
to get us court-martialed.

83
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,804
-I'll try.
-Nog!

84
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,222
Just kidding, Chief.

85
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,306
( laughing )

86
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,684
( sighs )

87
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,163
Russol?

88
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,379
-Russol?
-WEYOUN: I'm afraid he couldn't be here.

89
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,634
Weyoun.

90
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,056
Founder.

91
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:11,644
It is an honor to stand
in your presence once again.

92
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,646
Where's Gul Russol?

93
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,693
I'm afraid the Cardassian Central Command
had him put to death almost a year ago.

94
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,529
WEYOUN: I regret having to deceive you,

95
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,865
but it was the only way I could
think of to get you here.

96
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,368
Well, I'm here.
What do you want?

97
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,495
To serve you.

98
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:34,667
I no longer consider myself
a member of the Dominion.

99
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,671
You're defecting?

100
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,798
Do with me as you wish.

101
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,136
I place my fate entirely in your hands.

102
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,343
You don't believe me, do you?

103
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,597
{\an8}I believe Gul Russol is dead.

104
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,185
{\an8}You say you're defecting
from the Dominion? Why?

105
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:01,147
{\an8}-Founder, please...
-I've told you before, I'm not a Founder.

106
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:02,899
{\an8}As you wish.

107
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:09,197
{\an8}Odo... I'll tell you
everything you want to know, but first,

108
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,282
{\an8}we really should get aboard your runabout.

109
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:14,285
{\an8}The Jem'Hadar are already hunting for me,
and if I'm found--

110
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,787
{\an8}You still haven't answered my question.

111
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,461
{\an8}Why did you decide to defect?

112
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,713
{\an8}I realized my place is with you.

113
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,424
{\an8}You can do better than that.

114
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:34,805
{\an8}Then let's just say, I left Cardassia
because my life was in danger.

115
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,767
{\an8}-From whom?
-Everyone.

116
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,436
{\an8}Aren't you being a little paranoid?

117
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,688
{\an8}Of course, I'm paranoid, everyone's trying
to kill me.

118
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,233
{\an8}-Why?
-Because this war with the Federation

119
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,235
{\an8}was supposed to have been won months ago.

120
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,530
{\an8}Well, things don't always
turn out as planned.

121
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:54,200
{\an8}Quite true... and when things go wrong,
someone has to take the blame

122
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,993
{\an8}and this time, it's me.

123
00:08:56,744 --> 00:09:00,122
{\an8}Now...
we really should be going.

124
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:10,049
{\an8}Think about it, Odo.
The information I possess

125
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:13,761
{\an8}could help the Federation win this war.

126
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:17,348
{\an8}And you're willing
to share that information?

127
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,975
{\an8}All you have to do is ask.

128
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,855
{\an8}We've heard rumors
that the Dominion has established

129
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:29,694
{\an8}a new ketracel-white storage facility
somewhere in sector 507.

130
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,530
The facility's located
in the Pelosa system.

131
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,949
I can provide you
with the exact coordinates.

132
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,497
Odo to the <i>Rio Grande,</i> two to beam up.

133
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,457
( sighs )

134
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:53,217
Sit here, where I can keep an eye on you.

135
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,678
If it makes you feel better...

136
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,307
but you should know
I would never harm a God.

137
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,018
I'm not a God. I'm a security officer.

138
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,937
As far as I'm concerned,
you're just another prisoner.

139
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:09,150
You have no idea how much
it hurts me to hear you say that.

140
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,152
( sighs )

141
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,037
-I spoke to Edgar.
-Edgar who?

142
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,581
Your new best friend,
Chief Edgar Willoughby.

143
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:26,959
He wanted me to thank you for that bottle
of Gamzian wine you sent him.

144
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,130
-I didn't send him any wine.
-I took the liberty of sending it for you.

145
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:35,801
By the way, his wife's name is Cynthia.
They have a daughter, Melissa, age eight,

146
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,096
-and a son, Edgar Jr., age five.
-Did you get the stabilizer?

147
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,931
-Not quite.
-What do you mean, "not quite"?

148
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,850
Unfortunately, he's out of stabilizers

149
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,727
and won't be getting a new shipment
for another week.

150
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,395
Oh, well, that's it, I'm doomed.

151
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:50,816
Not necessarily. Eddie told me
the USS <i>Sentinel</i> has an extra stabilizer.

152
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,818
What makes you think
they're going to give it to us?

153
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,987
I didn't say they were going
to give it to us...

154
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,572
but they might be willing to trade for it.

155
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,199
Trade? For what?

156
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,951
Depends on what they need
and what we have.

157
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:07,208
Well, I suppose it doesn't hurt to try.
But remember, be discreet.

158
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,418
Rule of Acquisition 168,

159
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,587
"Whisper your way to success."

160
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,381
( chuckling ) Words to live by.

161
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,592
Chief, one more thing.
I need your authorization code.

162
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,511
-What for?
-The shipping orders.

163
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,304
Bring them to me and I'll authorize them.

164
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,890
I just thought it would save time.

165
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:25,684
When did you say the Captain
was going to be back?

166
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,938
( sighs )

167
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,983
Stop looking so worried, Chief.
I've got it all under control.

168
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,194
I sure hope so.

169
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,497
I wish you'd stop doing that.

170
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,499
-Doing what?
-Staring at me.

171
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,709
Was I? I didn't mean to.

172
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,920
You've been doing it
for the last ten hours.

173
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:56,715
I'm sorry.
It's just such an honor to be sitting here

174
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,758
with a G--

175
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,136
Security officer.

176
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:02,596
( beeping )

177
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,599
-We're being hailed.
-WEYOUN: Don't respond.

178
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,854
-It's a Cardassian transmission.
-Scramble the com frequencies

179
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,356
-So they can't lock onto us.
-I'm trying.

180
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:19,029
<i>Founder... it's an honor to speak </i>
<i>with you again.</i>

181
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:31,584
<i>-You look surprised to see me, Odo.</i>
-I'm well aware the Vorta are all clones,

182
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:35,504
but I'm not sure the universe
is ready for two Weyouns.

183
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,256
<i>I couldn't agree more.</i>

184
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:41,594
So, which of you is the Weyoun

185
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,930
I've had the misfortune of dealing
with over the past few years?

186
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,348
Actually, neither of us.

187
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:52,563
<i>That was Weyoun 5. Our illustrious </i>
<i>predecessor</i> <i>was killed a month ago.</i>

188
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,774
And I had the honor of replacing him.

189
00:12:55,858 --> 00:13:01,530
<i>What a sad day that was for the Dominion.</i>
<i>Weyoun 5 was a great man, a true patriot.</i>

190
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:06,952
His death in a transporter...
accident was most unfortunate.

191
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,830
WEYOUN 6: <i>And still under investigation.</i>

192
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:13,834
A very thorough investigation
that has found no evidence of foul play.

193
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,169
Interesting.

194
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:20,341
So, if you're Weyoun 6, you must be 7.

195
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:24,011
Clones, keeping track
of them is a full-time job.

196
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,640
And why were you activated
if he's still alive?

197
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:31,268
Normally, I wouldn't have been, but when
a clone is found to be defective...

198
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,437
-I'm not defective.
-WEYOUN 7: <i>Of course you are.</i>

199
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,940
What other explanation is there
for your behavior?

200
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,234
Leaving your post, defecting to the enemy.

201
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,903
-Are you calling Odo your enemy?
<i>-Absolutely not.</i>

202
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:44,198
I was referring to the Federation,
as you're well aware.

203
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:47,826
Enough bickering. Order him to trigger
his implant.

204
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,411
I was getting to that.

205
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,288
What implant?

206
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,123
Like all Vorta,

207
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,668
I have a termination implant
in my brain stem.

208
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:59,129
Prove your loyalty
to the Founders activate it.

209
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:02,800
The only Founder I'm loyal to is Odo,
and he wants me alive.

210
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,844
<i>I told you it was a waste of time</i>
<i>trying to reason with him.</i>

211
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,348
<i>You're a dead man</i>
<i>whether you activate the implant or not.</i>

212
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,017
<i>That ship will never make it back </i>
<i>to Deep Space 9.</i>

213
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,895
<i>Founder, there's really no need</i>

214
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,481
<i>for you to be involved</i>
<i>in this petty dispute.</i>

215
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:20,651
<i>If you'll just hold your position</i>
<i>until one of our ships can reach you.</i>

216
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,821
I have no intention of releasing
my prisoner to you.

217
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,114
WEYOUN 7: <i>If you don't,</i>

218
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,116
<i>I can't be responsible </i>
<i>for the consequences.</i>

219
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,452
That's an empty threat.
He wouldn't dare harm a Founder.

220
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,330
Maybe he won't, but I will.

221
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,918
<i>Think it over, shape-shifter.</i>
<i>One of our attack ships is on the way.</i>

222
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,430
Forgive me, Odo.

223
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,224
I should have told you
the truth about myself.

224
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,351
Well, it's not too late to start.

225
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,855
Why did you defect?

226
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,275
It's quite simple really.

227
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:06,447
From the moment I was activated,
I felt this war was wrong.

228
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:10,659
Please don't misunderstand me.
I still worship the Founders,

229
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,536
but I believe their obsession

230
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,123
with conquering the Alpha
Quadrant is misguided.

231
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:19,543
It's time they learned to live in peace
with the solids.

232
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,797
I know it's not my place
to question the Founders.

233
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,344
Maybe Weyoun 7 is right.

234
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,555
I am defective.

235
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,934
On the contrary.

236
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,644
What you're saying, about the war,

237
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,145
about the Founders...

238
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,148
Makes perfect sense.

239
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,569
I want to thank you, Odo

240
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,364
for the way you stood up for me,
protected me.

241
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,074
Well, don't let it go to your head.

242
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,618
I'd do the same for any prisoner.

243
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,453
Of course, you would.

244
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,622
You're a God.

245
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:15,724
To think a Weyoun
could be capable of such treachery.

246
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,978
I knew there was something wrong with him
from the moment we met.

247
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,230
He lacked your appetite for cruelty.

248
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,067
He's a disgrace to me and all Vorta.

249
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:32,324
Though... I suppose he can't be held
completely responsible for his behavior.

250
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:36,870
The Vorta cloning process
is a very delicate one.

251
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:41,458
Every once in a while, a clone is found
to be defective.

252
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:45,629
It's never happened to a Weyoun before
but, it does happen.

253
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:50,426
And speaking of treachery...

254
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:55,055
there is still the little matter
of the death of Weyoun 5.

255
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,516
You really believe I had something
to do with that?

256
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,977
You were supposed
to be on that transporter pad with him.

257
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,937
I was called away, urgent meeting
with Central Command.

258
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,188
How convenient.

259
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,649
-I always was lucky.
-Hmm.

260
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,652
Are you sure I can't interest you
in a glass of <i>kanar?</i>

261
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:14,116
I'm afraid our problems won't be washed
away quite that easily.

262
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,160
I don't know
what you're so concerned about.

263
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,829
Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun
a Jem'Hadar attack ship.

264
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:22,207
But what if he refuses
to hand over his prisoner?

265
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:23,876
Then he'll die.

266
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:28,213
He will not.
We can't kill a Founder. I forbid it.

267
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:33,510
Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take
your predecessor back to the Federation

268
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,846
where he will undoubtedly
reveal all he knows,

269
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:38,557
all you know,
about our strategic operations.

270
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,770
-You know what that means, don't you?
-It means we could lose the war.

271
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:46,523
That's right.
And I will not allow that to happen.

272
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:50,069
Cardassia has risked too much,
suffered too much.

273
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,321
I will not stand by
and let all of our plans,

274
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,032
all of our dreams
for the future end in defeat

275
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,618
just to spare the life
of one shape-shifter.

276
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:00,496
I don't believe the Jem'Hadar
are going to fire on Odo,

277
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,997
even if they're ordered to.

278
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,043
They don't need to know he's on board.

279
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:10,214
You simply order them
to destroy the runabout.

280
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,385
I suppose it could work.

281
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:20,682
But if the Founders ever found out that we
were responsible for Odo's death...

282
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,184
Who's going to tell them?

283
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:32,027
Odo doesn't even consider himself
a Founder.

284
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,404
Then we agree.

285
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,574
The runabout must be destroyed.

286
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,498
Excellent.

287
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:49,336
Now, I really think you
should try a little <i>kanar.</i>

288
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,018
( chuckles )

289
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:15,028
-Morning, Lieutenant.
-I'd make myself scarce if I were you.

290
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,780
-Why?
-KIRA: Chief.

291
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,198
In here now.

292
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:20,868
Tried to warn you.

293
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,085
Do you mind explaining this?

294
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,547
-Where's the Captain's desk?
-Oh, you don't know?

295
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,924
This is your authorization code, isn't it?

296
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,136
-Nog.
-What about him?

297
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,307
He must have traded the Captain's desk

298
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,809
-for the graviton stabilizer.
-Excuse me?

299
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,853
Don't worry, Colonel.
I will get the desk back.

300
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,605
Oh, you're damn right, you will.

301
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,982
The Captain is returning
from Bajor in two days,

302
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:57,237
and when he does, I want his desk
sitting right here, where it belongs.

303
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:00,616
Don't worry, Chief. I didn't give away
the Captain's desk.

304
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,743
-I just loaned it to someone.
-Who?

305
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:05,746
-Al Lorenzo.
-Who's Al Lorenzo?

306
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:08,248
The Chief of Operations on Decos Prime.

307
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,042
What does he want with the Captain's desk?

308
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,002
He wants to take a picture of it.

309
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,837
Why?

310
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,298
He likes to collect holophotos of himself

311
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:19,259
sitting behind the desks
of famous Starfleet Captains.

312
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,678
Usually, he just sneaks
into their offices,

313
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,389
but with the war on, it's been hard
for him to get away.

314
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,766
Well, that makes sense.

315
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:30,103
He's got quite a collection.
Captain DeSoto's desk, Captain Picard's--

316
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:35,317
Okay, fine. So... once he has his picture,

317
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,278
he's going to send us
the graviton stabilizer.

318
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,240
No. He's giving us an induction modulator.

319
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,158
But we don't need an induction modulator.

320
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,952
But the USS <i>Musashi </i>does.

321
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:46,912
Ah...

322
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:50,082
so the <i>Musashi's </i>going
to send us the stabilizer.

323
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,125
No. They're giving us a phaser emitter.

324
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,378
But we don't need a phaser emitter.

325
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:59,091
I know, but the USS <i>Sentinel </i>does,
and they have the extra stabilizer.

326
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:01,593
And they're willing to give
it up for a phaser emitter?

327
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,845
-That's the rumor.
-Rumor?

328
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,890
You've made all these deals
based on a rumor?

329
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,600
From a very reliable source.

330
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,394
Well, what if it turns out not to be true?

331
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:12,271
You have to have faith, Chief.

332
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:16,858
-In a rumor?
-No. In the Great Material Continuum.

333
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,696
Who are they?

334
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:24,992
It's not a "they." It's the force
that binds the universe together.

335
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:28,036
I must have missed that class
in engineering school.

336
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,955
NOG: On Ferenginar, we learn about
the Continuum

337
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:32,416
while we still have our first set of ears.

338
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:35,127
This is no time for Ferengi fairy tales.

339
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,212
The Continuum is real.

340
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:43,677
You see, there are millions
upon millions of worlds

341
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,431
in the universe, each one filled
with too much of one thing

342
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,016
and not enough of another.

343
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,893
And the Great Continuum
flows through them all

344
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,814
like a mighty river,
from have to want and back again.

345
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,608
And, if we navigate the Continuum

346
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,527
with skill and grace,

347
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:04,448
our ship will be filled
with everything our hearts desire.

348
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,616
Well, right now,
I'd settle for a stabilizer

349
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,535
and the Captain's desk.

350
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,164
The river will provide.

351
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:14,666
( scoffs ) If it doesn't sink us first.

352
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:23,133
( mumbling )

353
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:25,635
Odo?

354
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,182
( gasping )

355
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,810
Oh.

356
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,187
What's wrong?

357
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:40,025
I think I was... dreaming.

358
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,403
Sounded more like a nightmare.

359
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:51,036
I was on Earth...
Starfleet Headquarters.

360
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:57,167
I was supposed to report for my debriefing
but I couldn't find the right office.

361
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:02,380
Then I started calling your name,
but you didn't answer.

362
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:07,677
And then suddenly...
I was being chased by some Jem'Hadar...

363
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:11,181
or were they Klingons?

364
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:13,975
( chuckles )

365
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,440
Silly, isn't it?

366
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,527
Not at all.

367
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:27,197
It isn't easy to turn your back
on your own people.

368
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,492
Believe me, I know.

369
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:36,706
Odo, do you think Starfleet
would allow you

370
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,667
to conduct my debriefing?

371
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,172
Possibly.

372
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:49,177
It would make it much easier.

373
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,303
( beeping )

374
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,471
( alarm blares )

375
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,765
-What is it?
-Trouble.

376
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,909
I can't believe they're firing on us.

377
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:15,620
Trust me, they are.

378
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,582
But the Jem'Hadar would never obey
an order to harm a Founder.

379
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:21,918
Maybe they finally got it through
their head that I'm not a Founder.

380
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,838
Or they don't know who they're firing at.

381
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,715
We've got to let them know
you're on board.

382
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,551
They're jamming all the frequencies.
I can't get through.

383
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,220
They've been ordered
not to communicate with us.

384
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:36,016
Damar said he was determined
not to let us get back to the station.

385
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:42,063
See if you can get above them.

386
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:43,857
Why?

387
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,525
I'll explain later. Just do it.

388
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:53,742
What now?

389
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,453
Lock phasers on their dorsal
field junction.

390
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:58,163
Their shields are weakest there.

391
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,555
Well, congratulations.

392
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:18,350
You've just saved our lives.

393
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:22,437
And murdered loyal servants
of the Dominion.

394
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,690
May the Founders forgive me.

395
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,278
Has it ever occurred to you

396
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,114
that the reason you believe
the Founders are Gods

397
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,909
is because that's what they want
you to believe?

398
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:38,453
That they built it into your genetic code?

399
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:41,539
Of course they did.
That's what Gods do.

400
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:46,670
After all, why be a God if there's no one
to worship you.

401
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:58,431
Rom, where's Nog?

402
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:02,102
I don't know, Chief. Nog left the station
a couple of hours ago in a runabout.

403
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,354
Who gave him permission
to use a runabout?

404
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:05,397
You did.

405
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,775
Oh! I never should have given
him my authorization code.

406
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,611
Did he say when he'd be back?

407
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:12,821
Not to me.

408
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,614
How could he do this to me?

409
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,827
How could he leave me adrift
mid-river without a paddle?

410
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,370
What river would that be?

411
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:23,540
You know, the Great Material Continuum.

412
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:26,751
Oh, that river.
It can be very treacherous.

413
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,212
Tell me about it.

414
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:33,633
I suppose the good news is, with Nog gone,
nothing else can go missing.

415
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:38,221
Where are my cases of bloodwine?

416
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,347
( beeping )

417
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:43,852
I do not know, General,
but I promise you I will find out.

418
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:46,021
( snarling growl )

419
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,856
( kicks crate )

420
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,153
DAMAR: I don't understand it.

421
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:55,572
How could a runabout destroy
a Jem'Hadar fighter?

422
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:58,616
Isn't it obvious?
My predecessor must have helped Odo

423
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,285
get past the ship's defenses.

424
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:02,620
-Then how do we stop them?
-How else? Send more ships.

425
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:06,082
Send a whole battalion if necessary
from our base at Olmerak.

426
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,459
Consider it done.

427
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,837
Remember to tell them to fire on sight.

428
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:12,881
FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER: Fire at whom?

429
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:17,802
Founder, how may I serve you?

430
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:20,972
By answering my question.

431
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:25,727
We spotted a Federation runabout spying
on our base in the Olmerak system.

432
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,438
Surely one ship
shouldn't be much of a threat.

433
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:31,024
We'll have it destroyed within the hour.

434
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,234
Are you feeling all right?

435
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,236
Why do you ask?

436
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:37,781
Your face.

437
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,621
I'm fine.

438
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,582
But from now on,
I want the temperature in these rooms

439
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:49,250
lowered by 15 degrees.

440
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,962
I do not share
the Cardassians' love of heat.

441
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,423
Nor do I. Lower the temperature.

442
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,217
As you wish.

443
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:00,178
Is there anything else I can do for you?

444
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,722
Have you located Weyoun 6?

445
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:05,975
-It's only a matter of time.
-So you keep saying.

446
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:09,104
I assure you, Founder,
he will be dealt with.

447
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:20,907
Did you notice her face?
How parched it looked?

448
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,243
You heard her. These rooms are too hot.

449
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:26,913
I wonder.
I'm telling you she's not well.

450
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:29,541
She's not the Founder
you should be worried about.

451
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:33,920
Contact Olmerak and order those ships
to intercept the runabout.

452
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:47,016
Mmm... mmm-mmm.

453
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,648
( clatters )

454
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:56,484
( sighs )

455
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,778
That was filling.

456
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:00,780
I would hope so.

457
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:03,074
You've sampled
the replicator's entire menu.

458
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:07,078
I enjoyed the different... textures.

459
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,915
You mean tastes, don't you?

460
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:14,085
Not at all. The Vorta's sense of taste
is quite limited.

461
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,254
About the only foods we really enjoy

462
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,757
are <i>kava </i>nuts and rippleberries.

463
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,050
Ah. I take it

464
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:24,637
this is also the result
of your genetic programming?

465
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:28,266
It's the Founder's way of making sure
we remember our past.

466
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:32,854
You must know the story
of how the Founders created the Vorta?

467
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,482
( sighs ) No.

468
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:40,737
But I have the feeling
you're going to tell me all about it.

469
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:48,161
The Vorta used to be quite different
from what we are today.

470
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:53,166
We were forest dwellers, small, timid,
ape-like creatures,

471
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:54,793
living in hollowed-out trees.

472
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:59,631
Eating nuts and berries.
And living in fear of the many predators

473
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,341
that would hunt us for food.

474
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:05,678
One day, a wounded changeling
came stumbling through the forest,

475
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,847
fleeing from a mob of angry solids.

476
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:11,893
-Why were they chasing him?
-What does it matter?

477
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,354
Solids have always feared
and mistrusted shape-shifters.

478
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:15,396
You know that.

479
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:21,402
Well, a family of Vorta
hid the changeling from his pursuers,

480
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:24,489
and in exchange for saving his life,

481
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:28,368
the changeling promised
the Vorta that one day

482
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:32,580
we would be transformed
into powerful beings,

483
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:38,294
that we would become an important part
of a great new empire

484
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:43,550
-that would stretch across the galaxy.
-And the changeling kept his word?

485
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,511
That's right. Imagine, Odo,

486
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:51,391
my people were once little more than apes,
and look at us now.

487
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,686
Look at what you've done for us.

488
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:00,483
If the story were true,
it would at least prove

489
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:05,071
that my people are capable
of generosity and kindness.

490
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:11,286
You care about your people
very much, don't you, Odo,

491
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,830
in spite of all that's happened
between you?

492
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:19,669
Maybe I do,
but that doesn't change the fact

493
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:22,797
that they're responsible for a war
that's killed millions.

494
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:28,261
Odo, there's something you need to know.

495
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:33,141
A sickness has spread
throughout the Great Link.

496
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,184
The Founders...

497
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:38,938
are dying.

498
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:54,037
I was summoned to a meeting
by the female changeling.

499
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,581
She wanted to discuss
troop deployments with me,

500
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:59,542
and suddenly, her hands began to...

501
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,336
Shrivel.

502
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,088
It lasted only a second or two,

503
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:07,717
but over the last few weeks
it's happened a number of times.

504
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:10,428
It's like she's... withering.

505
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:17,727
And you're sure
the other changelings are also infected?

506
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:21,940
She said the entire Link
is suffering from the disease.

507
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,862
Everyone but me.

508
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:32,659
If they're unable to find a cure,
you'll be the last of your kind.

509
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:42,627
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?
Because I knew how much it would hurt you.

510
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:48,675
I'm sorry to bring you such sad news,
but at least you're not infected.

511
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:52,136
The Dominion will survive.

512
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,098
Meaning what?

513
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:59,435
Think about it, Odo.
You have an opportunity

514
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:03,272
to rectify the mistakes
your people have made.

515
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:08,653
To build a new Dominion
based on cooperation, not conquest,

516
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:14,242
on peace, not war,
a new order under your leadership.

517
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:19,455
And what's your role going
to be in this "new order"?

518
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:23,209
Whatever you want it to be.

519
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,379
I wish only to serve you.

520
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,467
( beeping )
( alarm blaring )

521
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,011
All right.

522
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,805
Then you can start
by telling me how one runabout

523
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:38,975
is going to survive an assault
by four Jem'Hadar ships.

524
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:41,019
I'm sure you'll think of something.

525
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,696
There's a Kuiper belt not far from here.

526
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:55,199
We might be able to hide
among the comet fragments.

527
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:58,619
But we don't have much time.
They're closing fast.

528
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,058
These comet fragments
are nothing but huge chunks of ice.

529
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,727
The Jem'Hadar will have
no trouble finding us.

530
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,438
Not if we become the ice.

531
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:50,463
( equipment powering down )

532
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,049
Well, with the power off

533
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:55,760
and the runabout in thermal
contact with the ice,

534
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:58,304
we won't generate enough
of an energy signature

535
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:00,056
for their sensors to read.

536
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:02,892
"We become the ice."

537
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:06,604
Only a God could think of such a thing.

538
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,898
Well, let's just hope the Jem'Hadar
give up their search

539
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:10,566
before we freeze to death.

540
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,693
My faith will keep me warm.

541
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,696
Hmm. Perhaps, but in an hour,

542
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:19,992
you may want to trade
in that faith for a thermal blanket.

543
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,164
What do you think?

544
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:26,958
It's white.

545
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,001
I know it's white.

546
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,336
I'm going to paint it.

547
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:32,839
It's the wrong shape.

548
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,092
It's the wrong height, the wrong width.

549
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,427
Other than that, it's perfect.

550
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:41,097
The Captain'll never suspect
you switched desks on him.

551
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:45,226
Julian, I need help, not sarcasm.

552
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,687
I'm afraid Nog's the only one
who can help you now.

553
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,314
If he gets back to the station
before the Captain does.

554
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,360
Maybe he's not coming back.
Maybe he's decided to make a run for it.

555
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,739
That isn't the Captain's desk.

556
00:35:58,823 --> 00:35:59,866
He's going to paint it.

557
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,201
Get it out of here!

558
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:03,953
Can I help you, General?

559
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:06,622
No... but he can!

560
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,501
O'BRIEN: Bloodwine?

561
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:16,924
Sixteen cases... sent to me by my wife.
Now, where are they?

562
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:20,887
-Well, how... how should I know?
-You authorized their removal.

563
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:24,140
That is your authorization code,
is it not?

564
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:25,558
Nog.

565
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:26,893
Chief...

566
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:32,982
I want that bloodwine
back here by tomorrow.

567
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,318
Understood?

568
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:43,534
( shivering )

569
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:44,994
Odo...

570
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:49,540
when you said
you were cutting power to all systems,

571
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,417
did that include life-support?

572
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,878
I'm afraid so.

573
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,214
Oh. That explains it.

574
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:57,715
Explains what?

575
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:00,468
Why I'm having trouble breathing.

576
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:06,349
We should have enough oxygen left
for another three hours.

577
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:10,311
Of course, by then,
we will have probably frozen to death.

578
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:12,897
But you can't die.

579
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:16,275
You have to survive
to rebuild the Dominion.

580
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,279
( explosion )

581
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,864
They found us.

582
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,752
-What do we do now?
-We can't stay here.

583
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:37,588
You're not going to try
to outrun those ships, are you?

584
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,215
What choice do we have?

585
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:08,995
-We're on fire.
-There's an extinguisher behind you.

586
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,457
What are you waiting for?

587
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:18,045
I live only to serve you.

588
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:35,771
( com console beeping )

589
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:38,607
What are you doing? Why have you activated
the com system?

590
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,321
All right. Call off those ships.

591
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:44,572
<i>Why should I? </i>

592
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:47,366
Because you don't need
them anymore.

593
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:53,622
<i>I'm glad to see </i>
<i>you've come to your senses.</i>

594
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,459
What have you done?

595
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:59,754
I've saved your life,
and the Dominion's as well.

596
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,131
<i>He's activated his termination implant</i>

597
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:04,800
<i>and proven himself </i>
<i>to be a worthy Vorta at last.</i>

598
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,970
I obey the Founders in all things.

599
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:12,975
Now call off those ships!

600
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:16,270
We don't know what he told Odo.
He may have revealed important tactical...

601
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,481
It's a risk we'll just have to take.

602
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:19,982
( console beeping )

603
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:22,693
I've ordered the Jem'Hadar
to break off the attack.

604
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:26,030
I see your runabout has suffered
some battle damage.

605
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,990
Will you require any further assistance?

606
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,575
I think you've done enough!

607
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:35,206
<i>I sincerely regret any... inconvenience</i>
<i>we may have caused you, Odo.</i>

608
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:40,711
<i>Please have a safe and pleasant journey</i>
<i>back to Deep Space 9.</i>

609
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:46,592
They say voluntary termination
is quick and painless.

610
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:48,094
I'm afraid it's not true.

611
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,512
I'll get you a pain suppresser.

612
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:53,432
That won't be necessary,
but there is one thing you can do for me.

613
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:54,350
What's that?

614
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,685
Give me your blessing.

615
00:39:58,521 --> 00:39:59,438
I... I can't.

616
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:00,773
Please, Odo.

617
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:04,485
Tell me I haven't failed,
that I've served you well.

618
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:07,655
You have,
and for that you have my gratitude...

619
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:13,786
and... my blessing.

620
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,858
Miles, the Captain's back.

621
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,609
I know. He sent for me.

622
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:46,735
Good luck.

623
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:48,654
Thanks.

624
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,577
Ah, Chief.

625
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:56,579
Captain, your desk...

626
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:58,622
Yes, it looks nice, doesn't it?

627
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,292
I came in this morning and found
Ensign Nog polishing it.

628
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,294
It was looking a little dull.

629
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:07,006
Well, here is the maintenance request
from the <i>Gettysburg.</i>

630
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,841
It should be docking here later today.

631
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:10,718
That'll be all.

632
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:12,595
Yes, sir.

633
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:15,055
Oh, about the stabilizer...

634
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,808
-Captain, I-I can explain.
-SISKO: Don't bother.

635
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:21,061
Ensign Nog tells me you were able
to get a hold of one this morning.

636
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,147
I was?

637
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:24,857
I mean, I was.

638
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,692
How long before you can have it on line?

639
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,904
Um... eight hours.

640
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:33,073
I plan to take the <i>Defiant</i>
out on patrol in two.

641
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,533
Two it is, sir.

642
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,038
I don't know how you did it, Nog.

643
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:42,166
I never lost faith
in the Great Material Continuum.

644
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,126
Ah, like you say, the River will provide.

645
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,211
Chief!

646
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:47,880
The waters just got choppy again.

647
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,466
I want you to have this.

648
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:52,343
Consider it an apology.

649
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:53,969
Well... you found the bloodwine?

650
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:56,805
Not exactly. Ensign Nog
returned from his trip

651
00:41:56,889 --> 00:42:01,810
with 16 cases of 2309,
a very good year.

652
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:05,105
An even better vintage
than the one my wife sent me.

653
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,941
( chuckles )

654
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:09,318
Well, I'm, uh...
I'm glad you approve.

655
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:10,986
And remember,

656
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,863
any time you're shopping
for wines or spirits,

657
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,657
my Cousin Gant is the man to see.

658
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,242
We will keep that in mind.

659
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,162
Your Cousin Gant?

660
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,331
-Just another sailor on the Great River.
-Ah...

661
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:26,001
By the way, Gant mentioned
he's got ten cases of Saurian brandy.

662
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,878
It's the Captain's favorite, you know.

663
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,088
Level 5.

664
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:31,173
What does he want for them?

665
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:37,263
I don't think I'll ever forget
the look on his face when he died.

666
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:41,892
He seemed so... content.

667
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,519
The last thing he saw

668
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:48,482
was one of his Gods smiling at him.
If you ask me, he was a lucky man.

669
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,402
Nerys, please.

670
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:53,529
No, listen to me.

671
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:55,990
I know to Starfleet

672
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:59,034
the Prophets are nothing
more than wormhole aliens,

673
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:02,621
but to me, they're Gods.

674
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:06,667
KIRA: I can't prove it.
Then, again, I don't have to,

675
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,919
because my faith in them is enough,

676
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:14,675
just as Weyoun's faith in you...
was enough for him.

677
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,597
Well, now it appears that the Vorta

678
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,433
may have to learn
to get along without their Gods.

679
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,310
I'm sorry.

680
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,731
You're worried about your people.

681
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:36,030
The changelings are dying,
and I can't help them.

682
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:41,285
-They're the enemy.
-A very dangerous enemy.

683
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,203
Now more than ever,

684
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,372
because they're all so desperate.

685
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:48,751
( sighs ) This isn't easy for you,

686
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:51,086
but you have to remember
they started this war.

687
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,129
You didn't.

688
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,256
That's true...

689
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,760
but I know now

690
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:01,388
whichever side wins,
one thing is certain...

691
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,351
I'm going to lose.
