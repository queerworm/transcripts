1
00:00:03,381 --> 00:00:04,907
Oh.

2
00:00:05,017 --> 00:00:06,110
A little lower.

3
00:00:07,121 --> 00:00:08,180
Lower.

4
00:00:09,191 --> 00:00:10,318
Lower.

5
00:00:12,766 --> 00:00:14,200
How's that?

6
00:00:16,573 --> 00:00:19,875
Well, I hope this
taught you a lesson.

7
00:00:19,913 --> 00:00:21,279
What's that?

8
00:00:21,316 --> 00:00:26,281
Never play springball
against a changeling.

9
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:27,760
Well, just for that

10
00:00:27,796 --> 00:00:31,132
next time, I'm not going
to let you win a single game.

11
00:00:31,169 --> 00:00:34,904
Well, then you'd better work
on your backhand.

12
00:00:34,943 --> 00:00:36,377
Mm-mm.

13
00:00:36,413 --> 00:00:39,476
Right now, all I want to do is
just sleep for two or three...

14
00:00:40,888 --> 00:00:42,653
oh, oh, oh...

15
00:00:42,692 --> 00:00:43,751
days.

16
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:44,989
Go right ahead.

17
00:00:45,063 --> 00:00:48,467
I should be back
by the time you wake up.

18
00:00:48,504 --> 00:00:50,337
Back? From where?

19
00:00:50,374 --> 00:00:52,844
I received a coded message

20
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,544
from Gul Russol this morning.

21
00:00:55,585 --> 00:00:57,418
Gul Russol.

22
00:00:58,891 --> 00:01:00,120
I thought he was executed

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,221
when Cardassia
joined the Dominion.

24
00:01:02,264 --> 00:01:04,792
So did I, but apparently
we were wrong.

25
00:01:04,836 --> 00:01:07,068
The message says
he wants to meet with me.

26
00:01:07,107 --> 00:01:08,302
Why?

27
00:01:08,344 --> 00:01:09,573
I don't know

28
00:01:09,613 --> 00:01:12,915
but he's my most reliable
Cardassian informant.

29
00:01:12,952 --> 00:01:14,386
You mean he was.

30
00:01:14,422 --> 00:01:16,950
What if Russol is dead
and this is just a trap?

31
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,360
I've thought about that

32
00:01:18,397 --> 00:01:19,923
but I have to be sure.

33
00:01:19,966 --> 00:01:21,400
I owe him that much.

34
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,374
Want me to come with you?

35
00:01:25,411 --> 00:01:27,745
Russol insists I come alone.

36
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,383
Don't worry, Nerys.

37
00:01:31,423 --> 00:01:34,020
I'll be careful.

38
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:35,792
Worried? Ha.

39
00:01:35,831 --> 00:01:37,425
This just gives me

40
00:01:37,468 --> 00:01:39,404
more time to work
on my backhand.

41
00:01:47,622 --> 00:01:48,612
Chief!

42
00:01:48,657 --> 00:01:50,057
How much longer

43
00:01:50,126 --> 00:01:52,927
is the Promenade
going to be closed?

44
00:01:52,966 --> 00:01:54,492
My bar is empty.

45
00:01:54,536 --> 00:01:56,233
My waiters are bored.

46
00:01:56,272 --> 00:01:57,798
And I'm losing money.

47
00:01:57,842 --> 00:01:59,174
Leave me alone, Quark

48
00:01:59,211 --> 00:02:01,613
or I'll feed you to one
of those plasma conductors.

49
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:02,982
Are you threatening me?

50
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:04,716
We're working as fast as we can.

51
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:07,422
As spokesman for the Promenade

52
00:02:07,462 --> 00:02:09,557
Merchants' Association,
I'm going to file

53
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,001
an official protest
with Captain Sisko.

54
00:02:12,037 --> 00:02:13,802
Put it in writing, Quark.

55
00:02:13,841 --> 00:02:16,073
I'll go find a padd.

56
00:02:18,082 --> 00:02:20,075
So, how much longer, Chief?

57
00:02:21,423 --> 00:02:22,482
Well, we should be
through here

58
00:02:22,525 --> 00:02:23,493
by the end of the day, sir.

59
00:02:23,527 --> 00:02:25,156
Oh, I'm not talking
about the Promenade.

60
00:02:25,196 --> 00:02:26,425
I'm talking about the <i>Defiant.</i>

61
00:02:26,466 --> 00:02:28,959
When is the gravity net
going to be repaired?

62
00:02:29,004 --> 00:02:30,302
The last time I stepped
onto the Bridge

63
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,503
I felt ten kilos heavier.

64
00:02:32,545 --> 00:02:34,242
I'm afraid it's going
to take some time.

65
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:35,510
How much time?

66
00:02:35,551 --> 00:02:36,746
About three weeks.

67
00:02:36,787 --> 00:02:39,315
We have to replace
the graviton stabilizer.

68
00:02:39,358 --> 00:02:40,724
You have three days.

69
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:42,628
I'm going to take the <i>Defiant</i>
back out on patrol

70
00:02:42,665 --> 00:02:44,897
and I don't want my crew
getting queasy

71
00:02:44,936 --> 00:02:47,406
because the gravity
keeps fluctuating.

72
00:02:47,442 --> 00:02:49,241
But, sir, the Sector
Quartermaster said

73
00:02:49,278 --> 00:02:52,580
it would take three weeks
to get us a new stabilizer.

74
00:02:52,618 --> 00:02:54,383
Well, that is your problem,
Chief.

75
00:02:54,421 --> 00:02:56,755
Now, I'm leaving for Bajor
for a conference

76
00:02:56,793 --> 00:02:58,729
and I want
that stabilizer replaced

77
00:02:58,764 --> 00:03:01,132
by the time I get back.

78
00:03:01,168 --> 00:03:02,227
Do I make myself clear?

79
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,431
Yes, sir.

80
00:03:07,482 --> 00:03:08,677
I don't mean to sound negative

81
00:03:08,717 --> 00:03:10,015
but I don't see
how you're going to get

82
00:03:10,053 --> 00:03:11,214
the <i>Defiant</i> ready in three days.

83
00:03:11,255 --> 00:03:12,621
Neither do I.

84
00:03:15,798 --> 00:03:17,893
This Quartermaster
you've been dealing with...

85
00:03:17,935 --> 00:03:18,960
what's his name?

86
00:03:19,004 --> 00:03:22,101
Uh, Chief... Chief...

87
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,200
Chief Willoughby.

88
00:03:23,246 --> 00:03:24,612
I mean his first name.

89
00:03:24,649 --> 00:03:25,617
I don't know.

90
00:03:25,651 --> 00:03:26,619
Is he married?

91
00:03:26,653 --> 00:03:28,452
Married? What does
that have to do

92
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,517
with getting us
a graviton stabilizer?

93
00:03:30,561 --> 00:03:31,688
Everything.

94
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:32,993
This Chief Willoughby must get

95
00:03:33,032 --> 00:03:35,264
hundreds of supply requisitions
every day.

96
00:03:35,303 --> 00:03:37,296
He can't possibly fill them all.

97
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,276
So he puts everyone
on a waiting list.

98
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:40,574
I know how he feels.

99
00:03:40,614 --> 00:03:42,641
I do the same thing.

100
00:03:42,685 --> 00:03:46,055
Well, the secret is
getting him to put you

101
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:47,525
at the top of that list

102
00:03:47,562 --> 00:03:48,825
and the best way to do that

103
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,527
is to form
a relationship with him.

104
00:03:50,568 --> 00:03:52,902
Get to know the name of his wife

105
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:54,305
his children.

106
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:55,970
Find out what he likes to eat.

107
00:03:56,011 --> 00:03:57,571
I don't have time to form

108
00:03:57,615 --> 00:03:59,551
a relationship with Willoughby.

109
00:04:01,222 --> 00:04:02,281
I do.

110
00:04:03,292 --> 00:04:05,855
I can get you that stabilizer,
Chief.

111
00:04:05,898 --> 00:04:06,923
In three days?

112
00:04:06,967 --> 00:04:09,267
Leave everything to me.

113
00:04:09,304 --> 00:04:10,329
All right.

114
00:04:10,373 --> 00:04:12,536
But don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

115
00:04:12,578 --> 00:04:13,910
Chief, I can't operate

116
00:04:13,947 --> 00:04:15,507
under those kinds
of restrictions.

117
00:04:15,551 --> 00:04:18,114
At least promise me
you won't do anything

118
00:04:18,155 --> 00:04:19,852
to get us court-martialed.

119
00:04:21,796 --> 00:04:23,162
I'll try.

120
00:04:23,232 --> 00:04:24,063
Nog!

121
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:25,592
Just kidding, Chief.

122
00:04:49,051 --> 00:04:51,044
Russol?

123
00:04:54,963 --> 00:04:56,226
Russol?

124
00:04:56,298 --> 00:04:58,291
I'm afraid he couldn't be here.

125
00:05:00,506 --> 00:05:03,103
Weyoun.

126
00:05:07,153 --> 00:05:09,020
Founder.

127
00:05:09,057 --> 00:05:13,395
It is an honor to stand
in your presence once again.

128
00:05:13,432 --> 00:05:15,197
Where's Gul Russol?

129
00:05:15,269 --> 00:05:17,205
I'm afraid the Cardassian
Central Command

130
00:05:17,273 --> 00:05:20,643
had him put to death
almost a year ago.

131
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:22,674
I regret having to deceive you

132
00:05:22,718 --> 00:05:25,485
but it was the only way I could
think of to get you here.

133
00:05:25,523 --> 00:05:26,957
Well, I'm here.

134
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,724
What do you want?

135
00:05:28,764 --> 00:05:30,996
To serve you.

136
00:05:32,872 --> 00:05:36,242
I no longer consider myself
a member of the Dominion.

137
00:05:38,015 --> 00:05:40,008
You're defecting?

138
00:05:40,053 --> 00:05:42,046
Do with me as you wish.

139
00:05:43,392 --> 00:05:47,127
I place my fate entirely
in your hands.

140
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,428
You don't believe me, do you?

141
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,101
I believe Gul Russol is dead.

142
00:07:53,278 --> 00:07:56,250
You say you're defecting
from the Dominion?

143
00:07:56,284 --> 00:07:57,252
Why?

144
00:07:57,286 --> 00:07:58,515
Founder, please...

145
00:07:58,555 --> 00:08:01,254
I've told you before,
I'm not a Founder.

146
00:08:01,294 --> 00:08:02,785
As you wish.

147
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,804
Odo... I'll tell you
everything you want to know

148
00:08:08,843 --> 00:08:11,542
but first, we really should get
aboard your runabout.

149
00:08:11,614 --> 00:08:13,105
The Jem'Hadar are
already hunting for me

150
00:08:13,151 --> 00:08:14,119
and if I'm found...

151
00:08:14,153 --> 00:08:16,784
You still haven't
answered my question.

152
00:08:20,298 --> 00:08:23,566
Why did you decide to defect?

153
00:08:23,638 --> 00:08:25,972
I realized my place is with you.

154
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,538
You can do better than that.

155
00:08:30,352 --> 00:08:32,822
Then let's just say,
I left Cardassia

156
00:08:32,857 --> 00:08:34,884
because my life was in danger.

157
00:08:34,928 --> 00:08:36,830
From whom?

158
00:08:36,865 --> 00:08:37,890
Everyone.

159
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,565
Aren't you being
a little paranoid?

160
00:08:40,605 --> 00:08:41,595
Of course, I'm paranoid...

161
00:08:41,641 --> 00:08:42,836
everyone's trying to kill me.

162
00:08:42,877 --> 00:08:44,209
Why?

163
00:08:44,246 --> 00:08:46,079
Because this war
with the Federation

164
00:08:46,117 --> 00:08:48,246
was supposed to have
been won months ago.

165
00:08:48,288 --> 00:08:50,724
Well, things don't always
turn out as planned.

166
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:51,727
Quite true...

167
00:08:51,761 --> 00:08:53,287
and when things go wrong

168
00:08:53,331 --> 00:08:55,267
someone has to take the blame

169
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:56,828
and this time, it's me.

170
00:08:56,872 --> 00:08:58,170
Now...

171
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,269
we really should be going.

172
00:09:03,785 --> 00:09:07,246
Think about it, Odo.

173
00:09:07,292 --> 00:09:10,594
The information I possess

174
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:14,138
could help the Federation
win this war.

175
00:09:14,173 --> 00:09:17,407
And you're willing
to share that information?

176
00:09:17,446 --> 00:09:19,109
All you have to do is ask.

177
00:09:21,554 --> 00:09:24,958
We've heard rumors that
the Dominion has established

178
00:09:24,995 --> 00:09:27,488
a new ketracel-white
storage facility

179
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:30,266
somewhere in sector 507.

180
00:09:30,305 --> 00:09:32,639
The facility's located
in the Pelosa system.

181
00:09:32,743 --> 00:09:35,236
I can provide you
with the exact coordinates.

182
00:09:39,256 --> 00:09:41,955
Odo to the <i>Rio Grande,</i>
two to beam up.

183
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:53,344
Sit here, where I can
keep an eye on you.

184
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,684
If it makes you feel better...

185
00:09:55,722 --> 00:09:58,785
but you should know
I would never harm a God.

186
00:09:58,828 --> 00:10:00,262
I'm not a God.

187
00:10:00,298 --> 00:10:01,858
I'm a security officer.

188
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:05,136
As far as I'm concerned,
you're just another prisoner.

189
00:10:05,175 --> 00:10:06,804
You have no idea

190
00:10:06,844 --> 00:10:10,112
how much it hurts me
to hear you say that.

191
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,128
I spoke to Edgar.

192
00:10:20,171 --> 00:10:21,366
Edgar who?

193
00:10:21,407 --> 00:10:23,741
Your new best friend,
Chief Edgar Willoughby.

194
00:10:23,845 --> 00:10:25,336
He wanted me to thank
you for that bottle

195
00:10:25,382 --> 00:10:27,249
of Gamzian wine you sent him.

196
00:10:27,285 --> 00:10:29,448
I didn't send him any wine.

197
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,460
I took the liberty
of sending it for you.

198
00:10:31,494 --> 00:10:34,091
By the way, his wife's
name is Cynthia.

199
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,000
They have a daughter,
Melissa, age eight

200
00:10:36,037 --> 00:10:37,768
and a son, Edgar, Jr.,
age five.

201
00:10:37,873 --> 00:10:39,102
Did you get the stabilizer?

202
00:10:39,143 --> 00:10:40,111
Not quite.

203
00:10:40,145 --> 00:10:41,113
What do you mean, "not quite"?

204
00:10:41,147 --> 00:10:43,049
Unfortunately,
he's out of stabilizers

205
00:10:43,084 --> 00:10:44,951
and won't be getting
a new shipment for another week.

206
00:10:44,988 --> 00:10:46,685
Oh, well, that's it;
I'm doomed.

207
00:10:46,724 --> 00:10:47,987
Not necessarily.

208
00:10:48,027 --> 00:10:51,056
Eddie told me the USS <i>Sentinel</i>
has an extra stabilizer.

209
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,797
What makes you think
they're going to give it to us?

210
00:10:52,904 --> 00:10:55,272
I didn't say they were
going to give it to us...

211
00:10:55,308 --> 00:10:56,799
but they might be willing
to trade for it.

212
00:10:56,877 --> 00:10:58,471
Trade? For what?

213
00:10:58,514 --> 00:11:01,179
Depends on what they need
and what we have.

214
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,887
Well, I suppose
it doesn't hurt to try...

215
00:11:04,928 --> 00:11:07,491
but remember, be discreet.

216
00:11:07,532 --> 00:11:09,468
Rule of Acquisition 168:

217
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:11,871
"Whisper your way to success."

218
00:11:11,907 --> 00:11:13,638
Words to live by.

219
00:11:13,678 --> 00:11:14,941
Chief, one more thing.

220
00:11:14,981 --> 00:11:16,644
I need your authorization code.

221
00:11:16,684 --> 00:11:17,652
What for?

222
00:11:17,686 --> 00:11:18,779
The shipping orders.

223
00:11:18,855 --> 00:11:20,552
Bring them to me
and I'll authorize them.

224
00:11:20,592 --> 00:11:22,528
I just thought it
would save time.

225
00:11:22,562 --> 00:11:25,830
When did you say the Captain
was going to be back?

226
00:11:28,908 --> 00:11:31,003
Stop looking so worried, Chief.

227
00:11:31,046 --> 00:11:33,711
I've got it all under control.

228
00:11:33,751 --> 00:11:35,277
I sure hope so.

229
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,637
I wish you'd stop doing that.

230
00:11:46,677 --> 00:11:47,645
Doing what?

231
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:48,647
Staring at me.

232
00:11:48,681 --> 00:11:49,649
Was I?

233
00:11:49,683 --> 00:11:50,844
I didn't mean to.

234
00:11:50,885 --> 00:11:53,117
You've been doing it
for the last ten hours.

235
00:11:53,157 --> 00:11:54,284
I'm sorry.

236
00:11:54,326 --> 00:11:57,025
It's just such an honor
to be sitting here

237
00:11:57,065 --> 00:11:58,864
with a G...

238
00:11:58,935 --> 00:12:00,267
security officer.

239
00:12:03,244 --> 00:12:04,770
We're being hailed.

240
00:12:04,813 --> 00:12:05,974
Don't respond.

241
00:12:06,985 --> 00:12:08,214
It's a Cardassian transmission.

242
00:12:08,254 --> 00:12:10,224
Scramble the com frequencies

243
00:12:10,258 --> 00:12:11,226
So they can't lock onto us.

244
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,558
I'm trying.

245
00:12:14,499 --> 00:12:15,762
Founder...

246
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:19,241
it's an honor to speak
with you again.

247
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,322
You look surprised to see me,
Odo.

248
00:12:29,363 --> 00:12:32,665
I'm well aware
the Vorta are all clones

249
00:12:32,702 --> 00:12:36,335
but I'm not sure the universe
is ready for two Weyouns.

250
00:12:36,377 --> 00:12:38,108
I couldn't agree more.

251
00:12:38,147 --> 00:12:43,488
So, which of you is the Weyoun
I've had the misfortune

252
00:12:43,524 --> 00:12:46,121
of dealing with
over the past few years?

253
00:12:46,163 --> 00:12:47,894
Actually, neither of us.

254
00:12:47,966 --> 00:12:49,663
That was Weyoun 5.

255
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:53,666
Our illustrious predecessor
was killed a month ago.

256
00:12:53,711 --> 00:12:56,581
And I had the honor
of replacing him.

257
00:12:56,617 --> 00:12:59,180
What a sad day that was
for the Dominion.

258
00:12:59,222 --> 00:13:02,388
Weyoun 5 was a great
man, a true patriot.

259
00:13:02,429 --> 00:13:04,865
His death in a transporter...

260
00:13:04,933 --> 00:13:07,666
accident was most unfortunate.

261
00:13:07,706 --> 00:13:10,576
And still under investigation.

262
00:13:10,611 --> 00:13:12,342
A very thorough investigation

263
00:13:12,382 --> 00:13:14,750
that has found
no evidence of foul play.

264
00:13:14,786 --> 00:13:16,277
Interesting.

265
00:13:16,323 --> 00:13:21,265
So, if you're Weyoun 6,
you must be 7.

266
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,104
Clones... keeping track
of them is a full-time job.

267
00:13:25,141 --> 00:13:28,545
And why were you activated
if he's still alive?

268
00:13:28,581 --> 00:13:30,015
Normally, I wouldn't have been

269
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,179
but when a clone is found
to be defective...

270
00:13:32,222 --> 00:13:33,190
I'm not defective.

271
00:13:33,224 --> 00:13:34,351
Of course you are.

272
00:13:34,393 --> 00:13:36,727
What other explanation is there
for your behavior?

273
00:13:36,764 --> 00:13:39,132
Leaving your post,
defecting to the enemy.

274
00:13:39,169 --> 00:13:40,603
Are you calling Odo your enemy?

275
00:13:40,638 --> 00:13:41,799
Absolutely not.

276
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,867
I was referring
to the Federation

277
00:13:43,911 --> 00:13:45,038
as you're well aware.

278
00:13:45,081 --> 00:13:46,276
Enough bickering.

279
00:13:46,316 --> 00:13:48,616
Order him
to trigger his implant.

280
00:13:48,654 --> 00:13:50,145
I was getting to that.

281
00:13:51,193 --> 00:13:52,218
What implant?

282
00:13:52,262 --> 00:13:53,891
Like all Vorta

283
00:13:53,931 --> 00:13:56,596
I have a termination implant
in my brain stem.

284
00:13:56,637 --> 00:13:58,971
Prove your loyalty
to the Founders...

285
00:13:59,008 --> 00:14:00,067
activate it.

286
00:14:00,111 --> 00:14:02,138
The only Founder
I'm loyal to is Odo

287
00:14:02,182 --> 00:14:03,742
and he wants me alive.

288
00:14:03,784 --> 00:14:05,184
I told you it was
a waste of time

289
00:14:05,221 --> 00:14:06,587
trying to reason with him.

290
00:14:06,623 --> 00:14:08,388
You're a dead man

291
00:14:08,427 --> 00:14:10,260
whether you activate
the implant or not.

292
00:14:10,298 --> 00:14:13,498
That ship will never make it
back to Deep Space 9.

293
00:14:13,537 --> 00:14:14,937
Founder, there's

294
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,535
really no need for you to be
involved in this petty dispute.

295
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:19,879
If you'll just
hold your position

296
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,886
until one of our ships
can reach you.

297
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,858
I have no intention of releasing
my prisoner to you.

298
00:14:24,893 --> 00:14:25,952
If you don't

299
00:14:25,995 --> 00:14:27,897
I can't be responsible
for the consequences.

300
00:14:27,932 --> 00:14:29,400
That's an empty threat.

301
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:31,804
He wouldn't dare harm a Founder.

302
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,240
Maybe he won't

303
00:14:33,277 --> 00:14:34,745
but I will.

304
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:36,772
Think it over, shape-shifter.

305
00:14:36,817 --> 00:14:39,755
One of our attack ships
is on the way.

306
00:14:49,008 --> 00:14:50,534
Forgive me, Odo.

307
00:14:50,578 --> 00:14:53,243
I should have told you
the truth about myself.

308
00:14:53,284 --> 00:14:55,220
Well, it's not too late
to start.

309
00:14:56,924 --> 00:14:58,689
Why did you defect?

310
00:15:00,464 --> 00:15:02,161
It's quite simple really.

311
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:05,572
From the moment I was activated

312
00:15:05,608 --> 00:15:07,510
I felt this war was wrong.

313
00:15:07,545 --> 00:15:09,344
Please don't misunderstand me.

314
00:15:09,382 --> 00:15:11,716
I still worship the Founders

315
00:15:11,753 --> 00:15:13,620
but I believe their obsession

316
00:15:13,657 --> 00:15:16,754
with conquering the Alpha
Quadrant is misguided.

317
00:15:16,797 --> 00:15:19,735
It's time they learned
to live in peace

318
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:20,862
with the solids.

319
00:15:20,905 --> 00:15:25,312
I know it's not my place
to question the Founders.

320
00:15:27,452 --> 00:15:29,547
Maybe Weyoun 7 is right.

321
00:15:31,058 --> 00:15:32,857
I am defective.

322
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:35,995
On the contrary.

323
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,698
What you're saying,
about the war

324
00:15:37,739 --> 00:15:39,572
about the Founders...

325
00:15:39,609 --> 00:15:42,638
makes perfect sense.

326
00:15:44,352 --> 00:15:46,151
I want to thank you, Odo

327
00:15:46,188 --> 00:15:49,314
for the way you stood up for me,
protected me.

328
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,384
Well, don't let it go
to your head.

329
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:53,389
I'd do the same
for any prisoner.

330
00:15:53,423 --> 00:15:55,052
Of course, you would.

331
00:15:55,092 --> 00:15:57,426
You're a God.

332
00:16:10,457 --> 00:16:12,393
To think a Weyoun

333
00:16:12,428 --> 00:16:15,628
could be capable
of such treachery.

334
00:16:15,734 --> 00:16:20,038
I knew there was something wrong
with him from the moment we met.

335
00:16:20,075 --> 00:16:22,102
He lacked your appetite
for cruelty.

336
00:16:22,146 --> 00:16:25,745
He's a disgrace to me
and all Vorta.

337
00:16:25,787 --> 00:16:29,318
Though... I suppose
he can't be held

338
00:16:29,361 --> 00:16:33,529
completely responsible
for his behavior.

339
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:37,135
The Vorta cloning process
is a very delicate one.

340
00:16:37,176 --> 00:16:38,667
Every once in a while

341
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:42,311
a clone is found
to be defective.

342
00:16:42,354 --> 00:16:43,983
It's never happened
to a Weyoun before

343
00:16:44,023 --> 00:16:47,325
but... it does happen.

344
00:16:47,364 --> 00:16:50,895
And speaking of treachery...

345
00:16:50,937 --> 00:16:55,902
there is still the little matter
of the death of Weyoun 5.

346
00:16:55,947 --> 00:16:57,883
You really believe I had
something to do with that?

347
00:16:57,918 --> 00:16:58,886
You were supposed

348
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,719
to be on that transporter pad
with him.

349
00:17:00,757 --> 00:17:01,656
I was called away...

350
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,057
urgent meeting
with Central Command.

351
00:17:03,095 --> 00:17:04,063
How convenient.

352
00:17:04,097 --> 00:17:05,794
I always was lucky.

353
00:17:05,834 --> 00:17:07,097
Hmm.

354
00:17:07,136 --> 00:17:08,195
Are you sure I
can't interest you

355
00:17:08,238 --> 00:17:09,365
in a glass of <i>kanar?</i>

356
00:17:10,677 --> 00:17:13,342
I'm afraid our problems
won't be washed away

357
00:17:13,383 --> 00:17:14,476
quite that easily.

358
00:17:14,518 --> 00:17:16,681
I don't know what you're
so concerned about.

359
00:17:16,722 --> 00:17:18,316
Odo couldn't possibly
hope to outrun

360
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,452
a Jem'Hadar attack ship.

361
00:17:19,495 --> 00:17:22,934
But what if he refuses
to hand over his prisoner?

362
00:17:22,968 --> 00:17:24,631
Then he'll die.

363
00:17:24,672 --> 00:17:26,106
He will not.

364
00:17:26,141 --> 00:17:27,268
We can't kill a Founder.

365
00:17:27,311 --> 00:17:28,974
I forbid it.

366
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,077
Unless we stop them,
Odo is going to take

367
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,884
your predecessor
back to the Federation

368
00:17:33,923 --> 00:17:36,724
where he will undoubtedly
reveal all he knows...

369
00:17:36,762 --> 00:17:39,255
all you know...
about our strategic operations.

370
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,031
You know what that means,
don't you?

371
00:17:41,071 --> 00:17:43,838
It means we could lose the war.

372
00:17:43,876 --> 00:17:45,003
That's right.

373
00:17:45,045 --> 00:17:47,413
And I will not allow that
to happen.

374
00:17:47,451 --> 00:17:50,753
Cardassia has risked too much,
suffered too much.

375
00:17:50,857 --> 00:17:53,089
I will not stand by
and let all of our plans

376
00:17:53,128 --> 00:17:55,291
all of our dreams for
the future end in defeat

377
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,169
just to spare the life
of one shape-shifter.

378
00:17:58,205 --> 00:18:01,234
I don't believe the Jem'Hadar
are going to fire on Odo

379
00:18:01,277 --> 00:18:02,837
even if they're ordered to.

380
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:07,053
They don't need to know
he's on board.

381
00:18:07,089 --> 00:18:10,995
You simply order them
to destroy the runabout.

382
00:18:14,337 --> 00:18:16,569
I suppose it could work.

383
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:19,410
But if the Founders
ever found out

384
00:18:19,448 --> 00:18:21,418
that we were responsible
for Odo's death...

385
00:18:21,452 --> 00:18:23,012
Who's going to tell them?

386
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:32,806
Odo doesn't even consider
himself a Founder.

387
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,643
Then we agree.

388
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,413
The runabout must be destroyed.

389
00:18:43,896 --> 00:18:46,128
Excellent.

390
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:50,130
Now, I really think
you should try a little <i>kanar.</i>

391
00:19:12,286 --> 00:19:13,481
Morning, Lieutenant.

392
00:19:13,523 --> 00:19:15,618
I'd make myself scarce
if I were you.

393
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,628
Why?

394
00:19:16,662 --> 00:19:17,630
Chief.

395
00:19:17,664 --> 00:19:19,964
In here now.

396
00:19:20,002 --> 00:19:22,029
Tried to warn you.

397
00:19:28,285 --> 00:19:30,848
Do you mind explaining this?

398
00:19:32,193 --> 00:19:33,161
Where's the Captain's desk?

399
00:19:33,195 --> 00:19:34,254
Oh, you don't know?

400
00:19:34,297 --> 00:19:37,360
This is your authorization code,
isn't it?

401
00:19:37,403 --> 00:19:38,837
Nog.

402
00:19:38,906 --> 00:19:40,340
What about him?

403
00:19:41,846 --> 00:19:43,645
Well, he must have traded
the Captain's desk

404
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:44,844
for the graviton stabilizer.

405
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:46,717
Excuse me?

406
00:19:46,755 --> 00:19:48,349
Don't worry, Colonel.
I will get the desk back.

407
00:19:48,391 --> 00:19:50,327
Oh, you're damn right, you will.

408
00:19:50,362 --> 00:19:52,855
The Captain is returning
from Bajor in two days

409
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:55,064
and, when he does,
I want his desk

410
00:19:55,105 --> 00:19:58,373
sitting right here,
where it belongs.

411
00:19:58,411 --> 00:19:59,606
Don't worry, Chief.

412
00:19:59,648 --> 00:20:01,345
I didn't give away
the Captain's desk.

413
00:20:01,384 --> 00:20:03,251
I just loaned it to someone.

414
00:20:03,288 --> 00:20:04,256
Who?

415
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,588
Al Lorenzo.

416
00:20:05,627 --> 00:20:06,595
Who's Al Lorenzo?

417
00:20:06,629 --> 00:20:08,895
The Chief of Operations
on Decos Prime.

418
00:20:08,933 --> 00:20:10,698
What does he want
with the Captain's desk?

419
00:20:10,737 --> 00:20:12,673
He wants to take
a picture of it.

420
00:20:12,707 --> 00:20:14,540
Why?

421
00:20:14,578 --> 00:20:17,106
He likes to collect
holophotos of himself

422
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:20,212
sitting behind the desks of
famous Starfleet Captains.

423
00:20:20,255 --> 00:20:22,623
Usually, he just sneaks
into their offices

424
00:20:22,661 --> 00:20:25,360
but with the war on, it's been
hard for him to get away.

425
00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:26,697
Well, that makes sense.

426
00:20:26,735 --> 00:20:28,226
He's got quite a collection.

427
00:20:28,271 --> 00:20:30,764
Captain DeSoto's desk,
Captain Picard's...

428
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,176
Okay, fine.

429
00:20:32,212 --> 00:20:36,482
So... once he has his picture

430
00:20:36,522 --> 00:20:38,958
he's going to send us
the graviton stabilizer.

431
00:20:39,026 --> 00:20:39,959
No.

432
00:20:40,028 --> 00:20:42,157
He's giving us
an induction modulator.

433
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,690
But we don't need
an induction modulator.

434
00:20:43,736 --> 00:20:45,899
But the USS <i>Musashi</i> does.

435
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:50,973
Ah, so the <i>Musashi's</i>
going to send us the stabilizer.

436
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:53,077
No. They're giving us
a phaser emitter.

437
00:20:53,121 --> 00:20:55,318
But we don't need
a phaser emitter.

438
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:57,727
I know,
but the USS <i>Sentinel</i> does

439
00:20:57,764 --> 00:20:59,996
and they have
the extra stabilizer.

440
00:21:00,102 --> 00:21:02,538
And they're willing to give
it up for a phaser emitter?

441
00:21:02,574 --> 00:21:03,599
That's the rumor.

442
00:21:03,642 --> 00:21:04,837
Rumor?

443
00:21:04,878 --> 00:21:07,406
You've made all these deals
based on a rumor?

444
00:21:07,449 --> 00:21:08,940
From a very reliable source.

445
00:21:09,053 --> 00:21:11,353
Well, what if it turns out
not to be true?

446
00:21:11,391 --> 00:21:13,258
You have to have faith, Chief.

447
00:21:13,294 --> 00:21:14,284
In a rumor?

448
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:17,895
No. In the Great
Material Continuum.

449
00:21:19,808 --> 00:21:21,140
Who are they?

450
00:21:21,177 --> 00:21:23,113
It's not a "they."

451
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:25,984
It's the force that binds
the universe together.

452
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,719
I must have missed that class
in engineering school.

453
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:30,956
On Ferenginar,
we learn about the Continuum

454
00:21:30,997 --> 00:21:33,399
while we still have
our first set of ears.

455
00:21:33,435 --> 00:21:36,134
This is no time
for Ferengi fairy tales.

456
00:21:36,174 --> 00:21:38,110
The Continuum is real.

457
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:44,717
You see, there are millions
upon millions of worlds

458
00:21:44,758 --> 00:21:47,730
in the universe...
each one filled with too much

459
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,825
of one thing
and not enough of another.

460
00:21:49,868 --> 00:21:52,840
And the Great Continuum
flows through them all

461
00:21:52,874 --> 00:21:54,400
like a mighty river

462
00:21:54,443 --> 00:21:56,845
from have to want
and back again.

463
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:59,615
And, if we navigate
the Continuum

464
00:21:59,654 --> 00:22:01,385
with skill and grace

465
00:22:01,424 --> 00:22:05,626
our ship will be filled with
everything our hearts desire.

466
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:07,659
Well, right now,
I'd settle for a stabilizer

467
00:22:07,704 --> 00:22:09,401
and the Captain's desk.

468
00:22:11,511 --> 00:22:13,174
The river will provide.

469
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,252
If it doesn't sink us first.

470
00:22:25,907 --> 00:22:27,900
Odo?

471
00:22:32,987 --> 00:22:34,820
Oh.

472
00:22:34,858 --> 00:22:36,828
What's wrong?

473
00:22:36,862 --> 00:22:39,925
I think I was...

474
00:22:39,968 --> 00:22:41,095
dreaming.

475
00:22:42,105 --> 00:22:44,302
Sounded more like a nightmare.

476
00:22:46,882 --> 00:22:49,410
I was on Earth...

477
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:51,753
Starfleet Headquarters.

478
00:22:51,792 --> 00:22:55,231
I was supposed to report
for my debriefing

479
00:22:55,265 --> 00:22:58,396
but I couldn't find
the right office.

480
00:22:58,438 --> 00:23:01,001
Then I started calling
your name

481
00:23:01,043 --> 00:23:03,479
but you didn't answer.

482
00:23:03,514 --> 00:23:06,452
And then suddenly

483
00:23:06,487 --> 00:23:09,186
I was being chased
by some Jem'Hadar...

484
00:23:09,226 --> 00:23:12,562
or were they Klingons?

485
00:23:19,948 --> 00:23:21,508
Silly, isn't it?

486
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,719
Not at all.

487
00:23:24,758 --> 00:23:28,357
It isn't easy to turn your back
on your own people.

488
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,696
Believe me, I know.

489
00:23:33,742 --> 00:23:37,739
Odo, do you think Starfleet
would allow you

490
00:23:37,784 --> 00:23:40,220
to conduct my debriefing?

491
00:23:43,528 --> 00:23:45,691
Possibly.

492
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:50,436
It would make it much easier.

493
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:53,879
What is it?

494
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:55,043
Trouble.

495
00:24:11,322 --> 00:24:14,021
I can't believe
they're firing on us.

496
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:15,690
Trust me, they are.

497
00:24:15,732 --> 00:24:18,066
But the Jem'Hadar
would never obey an order

498
00:24:18,103 --> 00:24:19,264
to harm a Founder.

499
00:24:19,305 --> 00:24:21,434
Maybe they finally got it
through their head

500
00:24:21,476 --> 00:24:22,603
that I'm not a Founder.

501
00:24:22,644 --> 00:24:25,480
Or they don't know
who they're firing at.

502
00:24:25,517 --> 00:24:27,077
We've got to let them know
you're on board.

503
00:24:27,121 --> 00:24:28,988
They're jamming
all the frequencies.

504
00:24:29,025 --> 00:24:30,254
I can't get through.

505
00:24:30,293 --> 00:24:32,924
They've been ordered
not to communicate with us.

506
00:24:32,966 --> 00:24:34,457
Damar said he was determined

507
00:24:34,502 --> 00:24:36,597
not to let us get back
to the station.

508
00:24:40,982 --> 00:24:42,747
See if you can get above them.

509
00:24:42,786 --> 00:24:43,845
Why?

510
00:24:43,888 --> 00:24:45,721
I'll explain later.
Just do it.

511
00:24:53,373 --> 00:24:54,534
What now?

512
00:24:54,575 --> 00:24:57,138
Lock phasers on their dorsal
field junction.

513
00:24:57,181 --> 00:24:59,014
Their shields are weakest there.

514
00:25:13,213 --> 00:25:16,674
Well, congratulations.

515
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:19,053
You've just saved our lives.

516
00:25:19,091 --> 00:25:23,726
And murdered loyal servants
of the Dominion.

517
00:25:23,766 --> 00:25:26,829
May the Founders forgive me.

518
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,278
Has it ever occurred to you

519
00:25:31,315 --> 00:25:34,219
that the reason you believe
the Founders are Gods

520
00:25:34,255 --> 00:25:36,988
is because that's what they want
you to believe?

521
00:25:37,027 --> 00:25:39,224
That they built it in
to your genetic code?

522
00:25:39,265 --> 00:25:40,859
Of course they did.

523
00:25:40,902 --> 00:25:42,496
That's what Gods do.

524
00:25:42,538 --> 00:25:47,571
After all, why be a God if
there's no one to worship you.

525
00:25:57,267 --> 00:25:58,998
Rom, where's Nog?

526
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:00,006
I don't know, Chief.

527
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,942
Nog left the station
a couple of hours ago

528
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,036
in a runabout.

529
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:04,946
Who gave him permission
to use a runabout?

530
00:26:04,983 --> 00:26:06,178
You did.

531
00:26:06,219 --> 00:26:09,487
Oh! I never should have given
him my authorization code.

532
00:26:10,794 --> 00:26:12,285
Did he say when he'd be back?

533
00:26:12,331 --> 00:26:13,526
Not to me.

534
00:26:13,566 --> 00:26:15,536
How could he do this to me?

535
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:19,476
How could he leave me adrift
mid-river without a paddle?

536
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:20,979
What river would that be?

537
00:26:21,015 --> 00:26:24,146
You know, the Great
Material Continuum.

538
00:26:24,188 --> 00:26:25,851
Oh, that river.

539
00:26:25,891 --> 00:26:27,588
It can be very treacherous.

540
00:26:27,661 --> 00:26:29,790
Tell me about it.

541
00:26:29,832 --> 00:26:32,599
I suppose the good news is,
with Nog gone

542
00:26:32,638 --> 00:26:34,471
nothing else can go missing.

543
00:26:35,911 --> 00:26:38,815
Where are my cases
of bloodwine?!

544
00:26:40,921 --> 00:26:42,618
I do not know, General

545
00:26:42,658 --> 00:26:44,525
but I promise you
I will find out.

546
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:53,773
I don't understand it.

547
00:26:53,813 --> 00:26:56,283
How could a runabout destroy
a Jem'Hadar fighter?

548
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:57,287
Isn't it obvious?

549
00:26:57,321 --> 00:26:59,086
My predecessor must have helped

550
00:26:59,124 --> 00:27:01,060
Odo get past
the ship's defenses.

551
00:27:01,095 --> 00:27:02,063
Then how do we stop them?

552
00:27:02,097 --> 00:27:03,360
How else?
Send more ships.

553
00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:05,164
Send a whole battalion
if necessary

554
00:27:05,203 --> 00:27:06,968
from our base at Olmerak.

555
00:27:07,007 --> 00:27:08,134
Consider it done.

556
00:27:09,144 --> 00:27:11,614
Remember to tell them
to fire on sight.

557
00:27:11,682 --> 00:27:13,948
Fire at whom?

558
00:27:15,423 --> 00:27:19,158
Founder, how may I serve you?

559
00:27:19,198 --> 00:27:21,863
By answering my question.

560
00:27:21,903 --> 00:27:25,137
We spotted a Federation
runabout spying on our base

561
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:26,610
in the Olmerak system.

562
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:29,310
Surely one ship shouldn't be
much of a threat.

563
00:27:29,351 --> 00:27:31,914
We'll have it destroyed
within the hour.

564
00:27:31,957 --> 00:27:33,950
Are you feeling all right?

565
00:27:34,963 --> 00:27:36,489
Why do you ask?

566
00:27:36,532 --> 00:27:38,502
Your face.

567
00:27:43,981 --> 00:27:45,507
I'm fine

568
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,144
but from now on, I want

569
00:27:47,187 --> 00:27:49,214
the temperature
in these rooms lowered

570
00:27:49,258 --> 00:27:50,419
by 15 degrees.

571
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,864
I do not share
the Cardassians' love of heat.

572
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,959
Nor do I.

573
00:27:55,003 --> 00:27:56,403
Lower the temperature.

574
00:27:56,439 --> 00:27:58,909
As you wish.

575
00:27:58,944 --> 00:28:01,039
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

576
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:03,644
Have you located Weyoun 6?

577
00:28:03,686 --> 00:28:05,212
It's only a matter of time.

578
00:28:05,256 --> 00:28:06,885
So you keep saying.

579
00:28:06,926 --> 00:28:10,262
I assure you, Founder,
he will be dealt with.

580
00:28:17,881 --> 00:28:21,320
Did you notice her face?
How parched it looked?

581
00:28:21,355 --> 00:28:22,516
You heard her.

582
00:28:22,557 --> 00:28:24,025
These rooms are too hot.

583
00:28:24,061 --> 00:28:25,029
I wonder.

584
00:28:25,063 --> 00:28:28,001
I'm telling you she's not well.

585
00:28:28,035 --> 00:28:30,871
She's not the Founder
you should be worried about.

586
00:28:30,907 --> 00:28:33,036
Contact Olmerak
and order those ships

587
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:34,742
to intercept the runabout.

588
00:28:43,971 --> 00:28:47,205
Mmm... mmm-mmm.

589
00:28:57,465 --> 00:28:59,367
That was filling.

590
00:28:59,402 --> 00:29:00,700
I would hope so.

591
00:29:00,738 --> 00:29:03,710
You've sampled
the replicator's entire menu.

592
00:29:03,744 --> 00:29:07,548
I enjoyed the different...
textures.

593
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:11,058
You mean tastes, don't you?

594
00:29:11,093 --> 00:29:12,288
Not at all.

595
00:29:12,328 --> 00:29:14,891
The Vorta's sense of taste
is quite limited.

596
00:29:14,933 --> 00:29:17,301
About the only foods
we really enjoy are

597
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,399
<i>kava</i> nuts and rippleberries.

598
00:29:19,442 --> 00:29:20,740
Ah. I take it

599
00:29:20,778 --> 00:29:25,311
this is also the result
of your genetic programming?

600
00:29:25,354 --> 00:29:27,824
It's the Founder's way
of making sure

601
00:29:27,859 --> 00:29:29,327
we remember our past.

602
00:29:29,362 --> 00:29:30,830
You must know

603
00:29:30,865 --> 00:29:33,530
the story of how the Founders
created the Vorta?

604
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:36,771
No.

605
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:40,249
But I have the feeling
you're going to tell me

606
00:29:40,284 --> 00:29:41,445
all about it.

607
00:29:43,958 --> 00:29:46,930
The Vorta used
to be quite different

608
00:29:46,964 --> 00:29:48,934
from what we are today.

609
00:29:48,968 --> 00:29:53,466
We were forest dwellers...
small, timid, ape-like creatures

610
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:55,480
living in hollowed-out trees.

611
00:29:55,514 --> 00:29:57,780
Eating nuts and berries.

612
00:29:57,819 --> 00:30:00,255
And living in fear
of the many predators

613
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:02,056
that would hunt us for food.

614
00:30:02,095 --> 00:30:03,962
One day

615
00:30:03,998 --> 00:30:06,765
a wounded changeling came
stumbling through the forest

616
00:30:06,803 --> 00:30:08,500
fleeing from a mob
of angry solids.

617
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:10,509
Why were they chasing him?

618
00:30:10,611 --> 00:30:11,977
What does it matter?

619
00:30:12,014 --> 00:30:14,918
Solids have always feared
and mistrusted shape-shifters.

620
00:30:14,953 --> 00:30:16,114
You know that.

621
00:30:16,156 --> 00:30:21,098
Well, a family of Vorta
hid the changeling

622
00:30:21,133 --> 00:30:22,533
from his pursuers

623
00:30:22,568 --> 00:30:25,472
and in exchange
for saving his life

624
00:30:25,508 --> 00:30:28,878
the changeling promised
the Vorta that one day

625
00:30:28,914 --> 00:30:33,321
we would be transformed
into powerful beings

626
00:30:33,357 --> 00:30:36,056
that we would become
an important part

627
00:30:36,096 --> 00:30:39,034
of a great new empire

628
00:30:39,068 --> 00:30:42,199
that would stretch
across the galaxy.

629
00:30:42,241 --> 00:30:44,234
And the changeling
kept his word?

630
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:45,577
That's right.

631
00:30:45,681 --> 00:30:50,885
Imagine, Odo, my people
were once little more than apes

632
00:30:50,925 --> 00:30:52,325
and look at us now.

633
00:30:52,362 --> 00:30:55,664
Look at what you've done for us.

634
00:30:58,307 --> 00:31:02,077
If the story were true,
it would at least prove

635
00:31:02,115 --> 00:31:06,522
that my people are capable
of generosity and kindness.

636
00:31:09,129 --> 00:31:12,033
You care about your people
very much, don't you, Odo

637
00:31:12,067 --> 00:31:16,508
in spite of all that's happened
between you?

638
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:20,677
Maybe I do,
but that doesn't change the fact

639
00:31:20,718 --> 00:31:22,688
that they're responsible
for a war

640
00:31:22,722 --> 00:31:24,088
that's killed millions.

641
00:31:24,124 --> 00:31:28,964
Odo, there's something
you need to know.

642
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:34,301
A sickness has spread
throughout the Great Link.

643
00:31:34,345 --> 00:31:38,046
The Founders...

644
00:31:38,085 --> 00:31:40,021
are dying.

645
00:31:51,947 --> 00:31:55,044
I was summoned to a meeting
by the female changeling.

646
00:31:55,086 --> 00:31:57,579
She wanted to discuss
troop deployments with me

647
00:31:57,625 --> 00:32:00,461
and suddenly,
her hands began to...

648
00:32:00,498 --> 00:32:02,365
shrivel.

649
00:32:02,401 --> 00:32:05,100
It lasted only a second or two

650
00:32:05,139 --> 00:32:08,738
but over the last few weeks,
it's happened a number of times.

651
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,748
It's like she's...

652
00:32:09,782 --> 00:32:11,547
withering.

653
00:32:13,957 --> 00:32:15,927
And you're sure

654
00:32:15,961 --> 00:32:18,762
the other changelings
are also infected?

655
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:23,264
She said the entire Link
is suffering from the disease.

656
00:32:27,251 --> 00:32:29,278
Everyone but me.

657
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,554
If they're unable to find a cure

658
00:32:31,593 --> 00:32:33,961
you'll be the last of your kind.

659
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,673
Why didn't you
tell me this earlier?

660
00:32:40,744 --> 00:32:43,614
Because I knew
how much it would hurt you.

661
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:45,176
I'm sorry to bring you

662
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:50,527
such sad news, but at least
you're not infected.

663
00:32:50,564 --> 00:32:53,502
The Dominion will survive.

664
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:56,702
Meaning what?

665
00:32:56,743 --> 00:32:59,145
Think about it, Odo.

666
00:32:59,181 --> 00:33:01,208
You have an opportunity

667
00:33:01,252 --> 00:33:04,520
to rectify the mistakes
your people have made.

668
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,586
To build a new Dominion

669
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:09,796
based on cooperation,
not conquest

670
00:33:09,836 --> 00:33:11,499
on peace, not war

671
00:33:11,539 --> 00:33:15,172
a new order
under your leadership.

672
00:33:16,783 --> 00:33:20,689
And what's your role going to be
in this "new order"?

673
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:24,526
Whatever you want it to be.

674
00:33:24,565 --> 00:33:28,096
I wish only to serve you.

675
00:33:32,415 --> 00:33:34,044
All right.

676
00:33:34,084 --> 00:33:36,851
Then you can start
by telling me how one runabout

677
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:40,090
is going to survive an assault
by four Jem'Hadar ships.

678
00:33:40,129 --> 00:33:42,497
I'm sure you'll
think of something.

679
00:33:50,551 --> 00:33:52,646
There's a Kuiper belt
not far from here.

680
00:33:52,688 --> 00:33:56,183
We might be able to hide
among the comet fragments.

681
00:33:56,228 --> 00:33:58,061
But we don't have much time.

682
00:33:58,099 --> 00:33:59,590
They're closing fast.

683
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:18,833
These comet fragments

684
00:34:18,874 --> 00:34:21,208
are nothing
but huge chunks of ice.

685
00:34:21,245 --> 00:34:24,149
The Jem'Hadar will have
no trouble finding us.

686
00:34:24,184 --> 00:34:26,712
Not if we become the ice.

687
00:34:51,806 --> 00:34:54,072
Well, with the power off

688
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:56,775
and the runabout
in thermal contact with the ice

689
00:34:56,816 --> 00:34:58,979
we won't generate enough
of an energy signature

690
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,354
for their sensors to read.

691
00:35:01,392 --> 00:35:04,762
"We become the ice."

692
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:07,770
Only a God could think
of such a thing.

693
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:09,067
Well, let's just hope
the Jem'Hadar

694
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,772
give up their search
before we freeze to death.

695
00:35:11,846 --> 00:35:13,907
My faith will keep me warm.

696
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:16,547
Hmm. Perhaps, but in an hour

697
00:35:16,589 --> 00:35:21,531
you may want to trade in that
faith for a thermal blanket.

698
00:35:25,072 --> 00:35:27,042
What do you think?

699
00:35:27,076 --> 00:35:28,705
It's white.

700
00:35:28,747 --> 00:35:30,546
I know it's white.

701
00:35:30,584 --> 00:35:32,383
I'm going to paint it.

702
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:35,052
It's the wrong shape.

703
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:37,723
It's the wrong height,
the wrong width.

704
00:35:37,765 --> 00:35:39,826
Other than that, it's perfect.

705
00:35:39,936 --> 00:35:42,840
The Captain'll never suspect
you switched desks on him.

706
00:35:42,942 --> 00:35:46,541
Julian, I need help,
not sarcasm.

707
00:35:46,582 --> 00:35:48,848
I'm afraid Nog's the only one
who can help you now.

708
00:35:48,954 --> 00:35:51,585
If he gets back to the station
before the Captain does.

709
00:35:51,626 --> 00:35:53,391
Maybe he's not coming back.

710
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:56,266
Maybe he's decided
to make a run for it.

711
00:35:58,138 --> 00:35:59,971
That isn't the Captain's desk.

712
00:36:00,009 --> 00:36:01,535
He's going to paint it.

713
00:36:01,579 --> 00:36:03,549
Get it out of here!

714
00:36:03,583 --> 00:36:05,280
Can I help you, General?

715
00:36:05,319 --> 00:36:07,916
No... but he can!

716
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:12,098
Bloodwine?

717
00:36:12,133 --> 00:36:16,233
16 cases...
sent to me by my wife.

718
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:17,834
Now, where are they?

719
00:36:17,945 --> 00:36:19,744
Well, how...
how should I know?

720
00:36:19,782 --> 00:36:21,273
You authorized their removal.

721
00:36:21,318 --> 00:36:25,759
That is your authorization code,
is it not?

722
00:36:25,794 --> 00:36:27,285
Nog.

723
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,766
Chief...

724
00:36:29,802 --> 00:36:34,870
I want that bloodwine
back here by tomorrow.

725
00:36:34,979 --> 00:36:36,972
Understood?

726
00:36:44,832 --> 00:36:46,323
Odo...

727
00:36:46,368 --> 00:36:48,304
when you said

728
00:36:48,338 --> 00:36:50,866
you were cutting power
to all systems

729
00:36:50,911 --> 00:36:53,040
did that include life-support?

730
00:36:53,082 --> 00:36:55,382
I'm afraid so.

731
00:36:55,419 --> 00:36:57,548
Oh. That explains it.

732
00:36:57,591 --> 00:36:59,059
Explains what?

733
00:36:59,094 --> 00:37:02,066
Why I'm having
trouble breathing.

734
00:37:03,636 --> 00:37:05,970
We should have
enough oxygen left

735
00:37:06,007 --> 00:37:07,772
for another three hours.

736
00:37:07,811 --> 00:37:09,279
Of course, by then

737
00:37:09,314 --> 00:37:11,979
we will have
probably frozen to death.

738
00:37:12,019 --> 00:37:14,285
But you can't die.

739
00:37:14,324 --> 00:37:18,059
You have to survive
to rebuild the Dominion.

740
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:23,936
They found us.

741
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,330
What do we do now?

742
00:37:34,364 --> 00:37:36,095
We can't stay here.

743
00:37:36,134 --> 00:37:39,163
You're not going to try to
outrun those ships, are you?

744
00:37:39,207 --> 00:37:40,904
What choice do we have?

745
00:38:07,263 --> 00:38:08,561
We're on fire.

746
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,263
There's an extinguisher
behind you.

747
00:38:12,975 --> 00:38:14,604
What are you waiting for?

748
00:38:17,116 --> 00:38:19,484
I live only to serve you.

749
00:38:37,256 --> 00:38:38,919
What are you doing?
Why have you activated

750
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,292
the com system?

751
00:38:42,533 --> 00:38:44,662
All right.
Call off those ships.

752
00:38:44,705 --> 00:38:45,832
Why should I?

753
00:38:45,874 --> 00:38:48,003
Because you don't
need them anymore.

754
00:38:50,984 --> 00:38:54,754
I'm glad to see you've
come to your senses.

755
00:38:55,894 --> 00:38:57,761
What have you done?

756
00:38:57,798 --> 00:39:00,463
I've saved your life,
and the Dominion's as well.

757
00:39:00,502 --> 00:39:02,870
He's activated
his termination implant

758
00:39:02,908 --> 00:39:06,347
and proven himself to be
a worthy Vorta at last.

759
00:39:06,381 --> 00:39:09,478
I obey the Founders
in all things.

760
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:14,271
Now call off those ships!

761
00:39:14,314 --> 00:39:15,680
We don't know what he told Odo.

762
00:39:15,717 --> 00:39:17,151
He may have revealed
important tactical...

763
00:39:17,186 --> 00:39:19,656
It's a risk we'll
just have to take.

764
00:39:21,061 --> 00:39:23,862
I've ordered the Jem'Hadar
to break off the attack.

765
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:27,066
I see your runabout
has suffered some battle damage.

766
00:39:27,106 --> 00:39:29,406
Will you require
any further assistance?

767
00:39:29,444 --> 00:39:31,311
I think you've done enough!

768
00:39:31,348 --> 00:39:34,809
I sincerely regret
any... inconvenience

769
00:39:34,855 --> 00:39:36,722
we may have caused you, Odo.

770
00:39:36,759 --> 00:39:40,324
Please have a safe
and pleasant journey

771
00:39:40,366 --> 00:39:41,995
back to Deep Space 9.

772
00:39:43,773 --> 00:39:48,111
They say voluntary termination
is quick and painless.

773
00:39:48,148 --> 00:39:49,582
I'm afraid it's not true.

774
00:39:49,617 --> 00:39:50,744
I'll get you a pain suppresser.

775
00:39:50,787 --> 00:39:52,450
That won't be necessary

776
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:54,187
but there is one thing
you can do for me.

777
00:39:54,227 --> 00:39:55,320
What's that?

778
00:39:55,363 --> 00:39:58,096
Give me your blessing.

779
00:39:59,371 --> 00:40:01,341
I... I can't.

780
00:40:01,375 --> 00:40:02,638
Please, Odo.

781
00:40:02,678 --> 00:40:05,844
Tell me I haven't failed;
that I've served you well.

782
00:40:05,884 --> 00:40:09,722
You have, and for that
you have my gratitude...

783
00:40:11,495 --> 00:40:15,765
and... my blessing.

784
00:40:42,791 --> 00:40:45,261
Miles, the Captain's back.

785
00:40:45,296 --> 00:40:47,266
I know.
He sent for me.

786
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,598
Good luck.

787
00:40:48,635 --> 00:40:49,967
Thanks.

788
00:40:54,581 --> 00:40:56,551
Ah, Chief.

789
00:40:56,585 --> 00:40:58,053
Captain, your desk...

790
00:40:58,088 --> 00:41:00,058
Yes, it looks nice,
doesn't it?

791
00:41:00,092 --> 00:41:02,757
I came in this morning and found
Ensign Nog polishing it.

792
00:41:02,798 --> 00:41:05,793
It was looking a little dull.

793
00:41:05,837 --> 00:41:07,568
Well, here is
the maintenance request

794
00:41:07,607 --> 00:41:08,734
from the <i>Gettysburg.</i>

795
00:41:08,776 --> 00:41:10,871
It should be docking
here later today.

796
00:41:10,914 --> 00:41:12,109
That'll be all.

797
00:41:12,183 --> 00:41:14,585
Yes, sir.

798
00:41:14,621 --> 00:41:16,887
Oh, about the stabilizer...

799
00:41:16,926 --> 00:41:18,121
Captain, I-I can explain.

800
00:41:18,161 --> 00:41:19,288
Don't bother.

801
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:20,457
Ensign Nog tells me

802
00:41:20,499 --> 00:41:22,662
you were able to get
ahold of one this morning.

803
00:41:22,703 --> 00:41:23,864
I was?

804
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:25,843
I mean, I was.

805
00:41:25,877 --> 00:41:28,109
How long before
you can have it on line?

806
00:41:28,148 --> 00:41:31,348
Um... eight hours.

807
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:34,519
I plan to take the <i>Defiant</i>
out on patrol in two.

808
00:41:34,561 --> 00:41:35,620
Two it is, sir.

809
00:41:38,803 --> 00:41:40,294
I don't know
how you did it, Nog.

810
00:41:40,339 --> 00:41:43,175
I never lost faith
in the Great Material Continuum.

811
00:41:43,211 --> 00:41:44,179
Ah, like you say

812
00:41:44,213 --> 00:41:45,476
the River will provide.

813
00:41:45,516 --> 00:41:46,484
Chief!

814
00:41:46,518 --> 00:41:49,319
The waters
just got choppy again.

815
00:41:49,357 --> 00:41:51,327
I want you to have this.

816
00:41:51,361 --> 00:41:53,297
Consider it an apology.

817
00:41:53,332 --> 00:41:55,802
Well... you found
the bloodwine?

818
00:41:55,837 --> 00:41:56,827
Not exactly.

819
00:41:56,872 --> 00:41:59,776
Ensign Nog returned from
his trip with 16 cases

820
00:41:59,812 --> 00:42:03,148
of 2309...
a very good year.

821
00:42:03,218 --> 00:42:06,486
An even better vintage
than the one my wife sent me.

822
00:42:08,328 --> 00:42:09,591
Well, I'm, uh...

823
00:42:09,631 --> 00:42:10,963
I'm glad you approve.

824
00:42:11,001 --> 00:42:12,162
And remember

825
00:42:12,203 --> 00:42:14,332
any time you're shopping
for wines or spirits

826
00:42:14,374 --> 00:42:16,003
my Cousin Gant
is the man to see.

827
00:42:16,044 --> 00:42:17,342
We will keep that in mind.

828
00:42:19,751 --> 00:42:21,448
Your Cousin Gant?

829
00:42:21,488 --> 00:42:23,082
Just another sailor
on the Great River.

830
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:24,093
Ah...

831
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,493
By the way, Gant mentioned

832
00:42:25,529 --> 00:42:27,556
he's got ten cases
of Saurian brandy.

833
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,331
It's the Captain's
favorite, you know.

834
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:30,360
Level 5.

835
00:42:30,406 --> 00:42:32,376
What does he want for them?

836
00:42:35,315 --> 00:42:37,182
I don't think I'll ever forget

837
00:42:37,219 --> 00:42:39,212
the look on his face
when he died.

838
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:41,657
He seemed so...

839
00:42:41,695 --> 00:42:43,392
content.

840
00:42:43,432 --> 00:42:44,798
The last thing he saw

841
00:42:44,835 --> 00:42:47,466
was one of his Gods
smiling at him.

842
00:42:47,506 --> 00:42:50,103
If you ask me,
he was a lucky man.

843
00:42:51,414 --> 00:42:52,905
Nerys, please.

844
00:42:52,951 --> 00:42:55,012
No, listen to me.

845
00:42:55,055 --> 00:42:57,355
I know to Starfleet

846
00:42:57,393 --> 00:43:00,422
the Prophets are nothing more
than wormhole aliens

847
00:43:00,466 --> 00:43:04,463
but to me, they're Gods.

848
00:43:04,507 --> 00:43:06,636
I can't prove it.

849
00:43:06,678 --> 00:43:08,204
Then, again, I don't have to

850
00:43:08,248 --> 00:43:10,650
because my faith
in them is enough

851
00:43:10,686 --> 00:43:14,181
just as Weyoun's faith in you...

852
00:43:14,227 --> 00:43:16,390
was enough for him.

853
00:43:19,303 --> 00:43:21,102
Well, now it appears
that the Vorta

854
00:43:21,141 --> 00:43:24,511
may have to learn
to get along without their Gods.

855
00:43:24,547 --> 00:43:26,038
I'm sorry.

856
00:43:28,421 --> 00:43:30,448
You're worried
about your people.

857
00:43:33,298 --> 00:43:37,967
The changelings are dying,
and I can't help them.

858
00:43:38,008 --> 00:43:40,274
They're the enemy.

859
00:43:40,379 --> 00:43:43,044
A very dangerous enemy.

860
00:43:43,084 --> 00:43:45,020
Now more than ever

861
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:47,150
because they're
all so desperate.

862
00:43:47,193 --> 00:43:49,493
This isn't easy for you

863
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:52,764
but you have to remember
they started this war.

864
00:43:52,803 --> 00:43:54,101
You didn't.

865
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:56,576
That's true...

866
00:43:56,611 --> 00:43:59,139
but I know now

867
00:43:59,183 --> 00:44:04,148
whichever side wins,
one thing is certain...

868
00:44:04,193 --> 00:44:06,595
I'm going to lose.
