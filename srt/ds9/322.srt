1
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:22,212
Excuse me.

2
00:00:24,062 --> 00:00:26,000
You're Dr. Bashir, aren't you?

3
00:00:26,035 --> 00:00:27,004
That's right.

4
00:00:27,038 --> 00:00:28,338
I'm Leeta.

5
00:00:28,376 --> 00:00:31,910
I've been meaning to come
by the Infirmary to see you.

6
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:36,833
Oh, dear.

7
00:00:36,868 --> 00:00:39,067
How long have you had
that cough?

8
00:00:39,107 --> 00:00:41,045
A few days now.

9
00:00:43,588 --> 00:00:44,682
May I?

10
00:00:47,265 --> 00:00:48,599
Cough for me.

11
00:00:51,545 --> 00:00:52,673
Hmm...

12
00:00:52,715 --> 00:00:54,185
Is it serious, Doctor?

13
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:57,662
No, but it's a good thing
you came to me when you did.

14
00:00:57,696 --> 00:01:00,637
We need to start
your treatment immediately.

15
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:03,806
Bring me a Fanalian toddy,
very hot.

16
00:01:03,848 --> 00:01:05,113
Make that two.

17
00:01:05,152 --> 00:01:07,181
I'm feeling a bit of a cough
coming on, myself.

18
00:01:07,258 --> 00:01:11,134
I'm... sorry to hear that,
Doctor.

19
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,834
No, please.

20
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:13,935
Call me...

21
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:15,039
Julian.

22
00:01:15,082 --> 00:01:16,780
Hi.

23
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:18,950
I'm Jadzia.

24
00:01:18,994 --> 00:01:20,726
Leeta.

25
00:01:20,765 --> 00:01:22,964
Before I forget...

26
00:01:24,343 --> 00:01:27,842
here's that immunological
data you asked for.

27
00:01:29,892 --> 00:01:31,453
How nice of you

28
00:01:31,498 --> 00:01:33,971
to put it together
for me so quickly.

29
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:36,981
I, uh... I think
I'll go over it right now.

30
00:01:39,589 --> 00:01:40,854
Oh, by the way

31
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,992
I hear the <i>Lexington</i>
is docking here

32
00:01:44,036 --> 00:01:45,597
for a few days.

33
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,940
The <i>Lexington?</i>

34
00:01:51,424 --> 00:01:53,293
Excuse me, um...

35
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:54,959
for just one second.

36
00:01:56,105 --> 00:01:57,735
Stay there.

37
00:01:59,682 --> 00:02:00,673
Jadzia!

38
00:02:03,226 --> 00:02:06,600
Do you happen to know when
the <i>Lexington</i> is coming in?

39
00:02:06,636 --> 00:02:08,231
Three weeks.

40
00:02:08,274 --> 00:02:10,303
Don't you have a friend aboard?

41
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,440
Do I?

42
00:02:11,484 --> 00:02:15,485
The Medical Officer...
Elizabeth Lense.

43
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,661
Elizabeth Lense...

44
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:20,811
You know, I think
she may have been

45
00:02:20,845 --> 00:02:22,714
in my class
at Starfleet Medical.

46
00:02:22,751 --> 00:02:24,346
Wasn't she valedictorian?

47
00:02:24,456 --> 00:02:26,017
That's right.

48
00:02:26,061 --> 00:02:27,999
And you were salutatorian.

49
00:02:28,033 --> 00:02:29,628
Second in my class.

50
00:02:29,672 --> 00:02:33,274
But if I hadn't mistaken
that preganglionic fiber...

51
00:02:33,316 --> 00:02:35,983
For a postganglionic nerve...
um, I know.

52
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:40,032
I would have been valedictorian.

53
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,771
You must be looking forward
to seeing her.

54
00:02:42,811 --> 00:02:45,615
I can hardly wait.

55
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:52,907
Hey, Jake-o.

56
00:02:52,941 --> 00:02:54,879
Hey, Dad.

57
00:02:58,157 --> 00:03:00,152
Hey!

58
00:03:03,974 --> 00:03:05,376
What is this?

59
00:03:05,412 --> 00:03:07,681
I thought it was time
for a change.

60
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:08,881
What do you think?

61
00:03:08,923 --> 00:03:09,892
I like it.

62
00:03:09,926 --> 00:03:10,895
Yeah.

63
00:03:10,929 --> 00:03:12,263
How was Bajor?

64
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,964
Beautiful!
You should have come with me.

65
00:03:14,004 --> 00:03:15,599
The reopening
of some old library

66
00:03:15,643 --> 00:03:17,615
isn't exactly my idea
of a good time.

67
00:03:17,649 --> 00:03:19,746
This wasn't just
some old library.

68
00:03:19,789 --> 00:03:22,058
We're talking about the
most extensive collection

69
00:03:22,095 --> 00:03:24,466
of Bajoran antiquities
on the planet.

70
00:03:24,536 --> 00:03:26,873
I saw manuscripts
that dated back

71
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,783
to before the fall
of the First Republic.

72
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,483
Great.

73
00:03:31,523 --> 00:03:32,685
Here...

74
00:03:32,728 --> 00:03:34,096
Look at this.

75
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,400
What is this,
some kind of ship?

76
00:03:36,438 --> 00:03:38,068
According to legend

77
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,105
the ancient Bajorans
used ships like these

78
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:41,517
to explore their star system

79
00:03:41,553 --> 00:03:43,856
800 years ago.

80
00:03:43,894 --> 00:03:45,524
You mean that when humans

81
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,072
were first sailing
across the oceans

82
00:03:48,106 --> 00:03:50,010
Bajorans were already
going to other planets?

83
00:03:50,046 --> 00:03:51,140
Some scholars say

84
00:03:51,182 --> 00:03:53,553
they made it all
the way to Cardassia.

85
00:03:53,656 --> 00:03:55,651
Ah, that seems hard to believe.

86
00:03:55,695 --> 00:03:56,960
What are these?

87
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,975
Solar sails.

88
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:03,976
These ships were propelled
by light pressure.

89
00:04:04,021 --> 00:04:06,152
Like a sailboat
catching the wind.

90
00:04:06,194 --> 00:04:08,166
Exactly.

91
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,167
I wonder if a ship like that
could really fly.

92
00:04:12,212 --> 00:04:15,051
I don't know.

93
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:17,926
That's why I'm going
to build one.

94
00:06:18,381 --> 00:06:21,789
I'm expecting a lumber shipment
from Bajor this afternoon.

95
00:06:21,825 --> 00:06:23,090
Okay.

96
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:25,158
Which reminds me...
I'll need a saber saw.

97
00:06:25,202 --> 00:06:26,570
A saber saw?

98
00:06:26,673 --> 00:06:28,976
You know, to cut wood.

99
00:06:29,012 --> 00:06:31,211
Why not use a laser cutter?

100
00:06:31,253 --> 00:06:32,848
Oh, no, I want to use

101
00:06:32,891 --> 00:06:36,197
the same types of tools
the Bajorans had.

102
00:06:36,235 --> 00:06:38,104
This will do fine, Major.

103
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,613
As soon as these cargo
containers are out of the way

104
00:06:40,648 --> 00:06:42,050
I'll start construction.

105
00:06:42,086 --> 00:06:44,719
Sir, I've looked over
the specifications

106
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,561
you brought back from Bajor.

107
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:49,438
I'm not sure this design
is spaceworthy

108
00:06:49,474 --> 00:06:50,774
and I'm positive
a ship like this

109
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:52,840
could never have made it
from Bajor to Cardassia.

110
00:06:52,884 --> 00:06:54,411
Now, why would you say that?

111
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:55,481
At sublight speeds

112
00:06:55,525 --> 00:06:57,292
the trip would
have taken them years

113
00:06:57,331 --> 00:06:59,360
and that's assuming
ideal conditions.

114
00:06:59,404 --> 00:07:00,965
One unexpected ion storm

115
00:07:01,008 --> 00:07:02,603
in the Denorios Belt
would have torn

116
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:04,743
the sails to pieces
and left them stranded.

117
00:07:04,787 --> 00:07:06,155
Well, maybe they were lucky

118
00:07:06,191 --> 00:07:07,593
and they didn't
go into any storms.

119
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:08,620
I just don't see

120
00:07:08,665 --> 00:07:10,226
how this ship could
have made the trip.

121
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,105
They didn't even have
replicators back then.

122
00:07:12,142 --> 00:07:14,046
They would have had
to store their air supply.

123
00:07:14,081 --> 00:07:15,642
And there's only room
on board

124
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:16,951
for a few weeks' worth.

125
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,894
Well, maybe they
recycled it somehow...

126
00:07:18,929 --> 00:07:21,425
used some kind
of photosynthetic plant.

127
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,439
Yeah, maybe.

128
00:07:22,473 --> 00:07:24,502
Oh, you sound just
like a Cardassian.

129
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:25,775
I beg your pardon?

130
00:07:25,816 --> 00:07:26,813
They have denied the possibility
of ancient contact for decades

131
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:28,408
They have denied the possibility
of ancient contact for decades

132
00:07:28,451 --> 00:07:30,218
because they cannot
stand the idea

133
00:07:30,256 --> 00:07:32,125
of Bajor having
interstellar flight

134
00:07:32,162 --> 00:07:33,530
before they did.

135
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:34,592
With all due respect, Major

136
00:07:34,636 --> 00:07:36,129
you're beginning to sound
like a Romulan.

137
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,142
A Romulan!

138
00:07:37,211 --> 00:07:38,738
There is no piece

139
00:07:38,782 --> 00:07:40,686
of technology in existence
they don't claim

140
00:07:40,721 --> 00:07:42,248
they invented
before everyone else.

141
00:07:42,292 --> 00:07:44,731
Look, I don't plan to spend
the next few years

142
00:07:44,767 --> 00:07:46,032
sailing to Cardassia.

143
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,566
All I want is to build
one of these ships

144
00:07:48,611 --> 00:07:50,549
and prove
that it's spaceworthy.

145
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,920
A computer model could do that.

146
00:07:52,957 --> 00:07:54,655
Why go to all that trouble?

147
00:07:54,696 --> 00:07:56,600
Why?

148
00:07:56,635 --> 00:07:58,436
Because it'll be fun.

149
00:08:58,219 --> 00:08:59,689
Oh, yes.

150
00:09:01,864 --> 00:09:03,927
You know, I've been thinking.

151
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,805
According to the star charts

152
00:09:05,843 --> 00:09:08,112
the most difficult part
of the trip

153
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:09,950
between Bajor and Cardassia

154
00:09:09,988 --> 00:09:12,051
would be getting through
the Denorios Belt.

155
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:15,001
After that, it would be smooth
sailing the rest of the way.

156
00:09:15,037 --> 00:09:16,405
Really?

157
00:09:16,441 --> 00:09:19,108
Just making that part
of the trip would go

158
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:22,318
a long way towards demonstrating
that the Bajorans

159
00:09:22,426 --> 00:09:25,059
could have made
the journey to Cardassia.

160
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,593
Seems reasonable.

161
00:09:26,638 --> 00:09:30,582
It should only take
about four, five days.

162
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,256
That's not so long.

163
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,659
So?

164
00:09:34,695 --> 00:09:35,664
What?

165
00:09:35,698 --> 00:09:37,168
So, what do you say
you come with me?

166
00:09:37,203 --> 00:09:38,673
We'll have a great time.

167
00:09:38,707 --> 00:09:41,237
The ship will be ready to go
in another week.

168
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:44,222
That's when Leanne is supposed
to be getting back from Bajor.

169
00:09:44,257 --> 00:09:45,887
I really want to see her

170
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:48,562
and I don't know
how long she's going to be here.

171
00:09:48,604 --> 00:09:50,941
Oh, well...

172
00:09:50,978 --> 00:09:53,417
if you can't do it...

173
00:09:53,485 --> 00:09:55,514
you can't do it.

174
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,092
I'd like to, but...

175
00:09:59,135 --> 00:10:01,540
it's just not good timing,
you know.

176
00:10:03,081 --> 00:10:04,381
Sure.

177
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:05,682
I understand.

178
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,214
Hi!

179
00:10:28,256 --> 00:10:29,692
Oh, hello, Jadzia.

180
00:10:29,727 --> 00:10:31,699
I brought you something to eat.

181
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:33,033
Oh, thank you.

182
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,513
Let me just finish this welding
and I'll take a break.

183
00:10:36,548 --> 00:10:40,047
Benjamin, I can't believe
the work you've put into this.

184
00:10:40,091 --> 00:10:42,564
I'm just following
the blueprint.

185
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:45,939
But you didn't have to bother
with detail like this

186
00:10:45,975 --> 00:10:48,848
to prove that the ship
is spaceworthy.

187
00:10:48,884 --> 00:10:50,582
Oh, I suppose not

188
00:10:50,656 --> 00:10:53,152
but I want everything
to be just right.

189
00:10:53,197 --> 00:10:54,690
It's an exact replica,
you know

190
00:10:54,735 --> 00:10:58,109
except for the gravity net
that I installed in the floor.

191
00:10:58,145 --> 00:11:00,083
Weightlessness makes me queasy.

192
00:11:01,321 --> 00:11:04,228
Ooh, I haven't seen you
like this for a long time.

193
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:05,894
Like what?

194
00:11:05,935 --> 00:11:07,496
So caught up in something.

195
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:09,511
So excited.

196
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:11,277
Not since, um...

197
00:11:11,318 --> 00:11:14,555
not since you and Jennifer
decided to have a baby.

198
00:11:14,594 --> 00:11:16,258
Ah, the nursery.

199
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,933
I don't think anyone's
ever put such effort

200
00:11:18,974 --> 00:11:21,105
into making a room
for their child.

201
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:24,055
Well, you have to admit,
it turned out pretty well.

202
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:25,354
Oh...

203
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,992
especially the starscape
on the ceiling.

204
00:11:28,034 --> 00:11:30,029
Yeah, Jake loved that ceiling.

205
00:11:30,074 --> 00:11:32,639
In fact, when we
moved out of the house

206
00:11:32,682 --> 00:11:35,452
he couldn't understand why
we couldn't bring it with us.

207
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:40,165
You're disappointed
he's not going with you

208
00:11:40,205 --> 00:11:41,573
on this trip, aren't you?

209
00:11:41,608 --> 00:11:44,378
Well, he has other things
he'd rather be doing.

210
00:11:44,417 --> 00:11:47,415
Friends he'd rather be with.

211
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:49,157
It's funny...

212
00:11:49,198 --> 00:11:51,694
a year or two ago, nothing
would have stopped him

213
00:11:51,806 --> 00:11:54,473
from coming with me
on an adventure like this.

214
00:11:55,751 --> 00:11:58,316
I guess I waited too long.

215
00:11:58,359 --> 00:12:00,456
You'll have other adventures,
Benjamin.

216
00:12:00,498 --> 00:12:01,968
They'll just be different.

217
00:12:02,003 --> 00:12:03,496
Believe me, I know.

218
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:06,174
I've been a father
a couple of times myself.

219
00:12:06,216 --> 00:12:09,453
Oh, I could tell you stories.

220
00:12:09,492 --> 00:12:10,757
You already have.

221
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:14,703
That's right, I have, haven't I?

222
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,974
Then you know I'm right.

223
00:12:25,707 --> 00:12:26,835
Computer...

224
00:12:26,878 --> 00:12:28,542
are there any messages for me?

225
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:29,950
One.

226
00:12:29,987 --> 00:12:32,050
A communication
from Wellington, New Zealand.

227
00:12:32,093 --> 00:12:34,258
Display it on screen.

228
00:13:03,186 --> 00:13:04,314
Hello.

229
00:13:04,357 --> 00:13:05,793
Welcome aboard, son.

230
00:13:05,861 --> 00:13:07,091
Hey, Dad.

231
00:13:07,131 --> 00:13:09,035
So...

232
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,540
what do you think?

233
00:13:10,575 --> 00:13:12,239
Well, it's wonderful.

234
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:15,254
Maybe a bit small
for two people, but, uh...

235
00:13:15,288 --> 00:13:18,286
I think I could get used to it.

236
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:21,032
That is, uh, if you
still want me along.

237
00:13:43,477 --> 00:13:44,742
Oh...

238
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,413
<i>"A Survey of Cygnian</i>
<i>Respiratory Diseases"?</i>

239
00:13:47,522 --> 00:13:48,890
Fascinating.

240
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,899
Yeah, I'm reading
just about everything

241
00:13:50,933 --> 00:13:52,061
I can get my hands on.

242
00:13:52,103 --> 00:13:54,041
I don't want to be
caught flat-footed

243
00:13:54,075 --> 00:13:56,047
by our intrepid Dr. Lense.

244
00:13:56,081 --> 00:13:58,053
It's useless, of course.

245
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,583
She's probably discovered
the cure to aging by now.

246
00:14:00,628 --> 00:14:03,398
I take it the two of you
are competitive?

247
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,804
Absolutely.

248
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,009
We were neck and neck
right until the final exam.

249
00:14:08,051 --> 00:14:10,250
Then... I blew it.

250
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,194
That's how she wound up
on the <i>Lexington...</i>

251
00:14:12,229 --> 00:14:13,665
a post which virtually everyone

252
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,535
in our graduating class
was hoping for.

253
00:14:15,573 --> 00:14:16,838
Including you?

254
00:14:18,214 --> 00:14:21,348
No, this is the assignment
I wanted.

255
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,385
Then what does it matter?

256
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,367
Well, don't you see?

257
00:14:25,402 --> 00:14:26,564
She could have had this post.

258
00:14:26,606 --> 00:14:28,236
She could have taken it from me.

259
00:14:28,277 --> 00:14:29,975
No matter what I accomplish
while I'm here

260
00:14:30,016 --> 00:14:34,085
somehow, that'll always
make me feel...

261
00:14:34,129 --> 00:14:35,896
second best.

262
00:14:42,821 --> 00:14:45,796
I understand
you're planning a trip.

263
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,493
Word gets around.

264
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:52,004
I can't believe
that a man of your intelligence

265
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:54,784
would take stock
in Bajoran fairy tales

266
00:14:54,823 --> 00:14:56,658
about ancient contact.

267
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:58,565
If you recall

268
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:02,875
you thought the Celestial Temple
was a Bajoran fairy tale

269
00:15:02,914 --> 00:15:05,387
until we discovered
the wormhole.

270
00:15:05,422 --> 00:15:08,055
I suggest you
reconsider your plans.

271
00:15:08,097 --> 00:15:12,098
Solar vessels are very fragile,
and it's a long way

272
00:15:12,142 --> 00:15:15,276
to the Denorios Belt
at sublight speeds.

273
00:15:15,318 --> 00:15:16,548
Don't worry.

274
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:19,028
I'll have emergency equipment
on board.

275
00:15:19,062 --> 00:15:20,362
If something goes wrong

276
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,307
Major Kira can have a runabout
to me within an hour.

277
00:15:23,342 --> 00:15:26,579
An hour can be a very long time

278
00:15:26,619 --> 00:15:30,255
especially if you happen to
encounter something unexpected.

279
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:31,527
Like what?

280
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:32,728
Oh, I don't know.

281
00:15:32,771 --> 00:15:34,766
A Maquis ship, perhaps.

282
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,443
Why would the Maquis
have any quarrel

283
00:15:37,484 --> 00:15:41,222
with an unarmed ship sailing
toward the Denorios Belt?

284
00:15:41,263 --> 00:15:44,535
They have nothing at stake here,
nothing to prove...

285
00:15:44,572 --> 00:15:47,570
or should I say, disprove.

286
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:52,618
Commander, I contacted you
out of concern for your safety

287
00:15:52,664 --> 00:15:54,602
but you seem to be intimating

288
00:15:54,635 --> 00:15:56,904
that I've made
some sort of threat.

289
00:15:56,943 --> 00:15:58,915
Ah, then I'm glad I was wrong.

290
00:15:58,949 --> 00:16:02,984
For a moment there, I thought
that you had been put in charge

291
00:16:03,027 --> 00:16:04,759
of the Cardassian Ministry

292
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,570
for the Refutation
of Bajoran Fairy Tales.

293
00:16:07,608 --> 00:16:11,518
Since I don't seem
to be able to dissuade you

294
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:15,087
from undertaking
this little voyage of yours

295
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:17,364
I'll wish you luck instead.

296
00:16:17,404 --> 00:16:20,174
Let's hope you don't need it.

297
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,239
All right, first, we have
to deploy the mainsails.

298
00:16:41,276 --> 00:16:43,579
I want you to take
that winch right there.

299
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,722
Huh? Release brakes.

300
00:16:48,765 --> 00:16:50,395
All right.

301
00:16:50,436 --> 00:16:53,901
When I give you the word,
crank it with all you got.

302
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:55,611
And... now.

303
00:17:15,778 --> 00:17:17,579
That's as far as they'll go.

304
00:17:17,618 --> 00:17:19,248
Lock it off.

305
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:20,589
All right...

306
00:17:20,627 --> 00:17:22,622
let's work on the spritsails.

307
00:17:25,475 --> 00:17:26,775
Psst.

308
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:28,281
Oh.

309
00:17:28,316 --> 00:17:30,447
All right, now get
your back into it, huh?

310
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,824
All right.

311
00:17:36,173 --> 00:17:37,541
That's right.

312
00:17:37,577 --> 00:17:39,846
We'll make a sailor
out of you yet.

313
00:17:55,899 --> 00:17:58,498
These will trim the spritsails.

314
00:18:09,707 --> 00:18:11,007
Now I get it.

315
00:18:11,044 --> 00:18:12,514
What?

316
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:15,022
Why you wanted
to build this ship.

317
00:18:15,056 --> 00:18:17,552
It is beautiful, isn't it?

318
00:18:36,525 --> 00:18:37,790
Jake-o.

319
00:18:37,828 --> 00:18:40,962
Trim the starboard sprit
about six degrees.

320
00:18:41,005 --> 00:18:42,339
Okay.

321
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,000
How's that?

322
00:18:51,035 --> 00:18:52,836
That should do it.

323
00:18:52,873 --> 00:18:54,605
We'll start to pick up speed

324
00:18:54,645 --> 00:18:56,982
as the pressure
on the sails builds.

325
00:18:58,323 --> 00:18:59,451
Hey, Dad...

326
00:18:59,493 --> 00:19:00,793
where do we sleep?

327
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:03,099
We have hammocks
we can string up later.

328
00:19:03,138 --> 00:19:04,334
Is this the bathroom?

329
00:19:04,374 --> 00:19:07,075
Yes, it was designed

330
00:19:07,116 --> 00:19:08,951
for a zero-gravity
environment.

331
00:19:10,693 --> 00:19:12,163
Well, how am I supposed to?

332
00:19:12,198 --> 00:19:14,136
How are you supposed to, um?

333
00:19:14,171 --> 00:19:16,474
You'll get the hang of it.

334
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,604
Hmm.

335
00:19:17,648 --> 00:19:19,278
We'll be tacking
against the light

336
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:20,721
most of the way.

337
00:19:20,757 --> 00:19:22,524
And then we'll run like this

338
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:25,330
for about 90 minutes or so
and come about.

339
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:28,174
And I'll calculate
the next leg of our trip.

340
00:19:28,213 --> 00:19:30,048
How about something to drink?

341
00:19:30,084 --> 00:19:31,418
Yeah, sure.

342
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:41,780
Don't tell me we only have
zero-gravity rations.

343
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,954
It's all
the ancient Bajorans had.

344
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,797
Listen.

345
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:01,003
I don't hear anything.

346
00:20:01,044 --> 00:20:02,309
Exactly.

347
00:20:02,348 --> 00:20:05,346
Not even the hum of an engine.

348
00:20:07,363 --> 00:20:12,002
It's almost like being on
the deck of an old sailing ship.

349
00:20:12,043 --> 00:20:16,181
Except the stars
are not just up in the sky

350
00:20:16,223 --> 00:20:19,357
they're all around us.

351
00:20:19,399 --> 00:20:23,708
Imagine how the ancient Bajorans
must have felt

352
00:20:23,812 --> 00:20:27,722
heading into space
in a ship like this one

353
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:30,630
not knowing what they
were going to find

354
00:20:30,665 --> 00:20:33,002
or who they were going to meet.

355
00:20:37,788 --> 00:20:39,418
Jake...

356
00:20:39,459 --> 00:20:43,460
I know that you really didn't
want to come on this trip.

357
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:50,018
I just want to say,
I'm glad you're here.

358
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:56,232
Dad, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

359
00:20:56,276 --> 00:20:58,647
What is it?

360
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,508
First, you should read this.

361
00:21:12,658 --> 00:21:14,789
It's a story I wrote.

362
00:21:14,832 --> 00:21:16,564
Ah, a story.

363
00:21:16,603 --> 00:21:18,906
That's why you kept
putting this away

364
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,349
every time I walked
into the room, huh?

365
00:21:26,199 --> 00:21:28,764
Well, if you'll keep an eye
on the rigging

366
00:21:28,806 --> 00:21:30,778
I'll read it right now.

367
00:21:30,812 --> 00:21:32,214
Deal.

368
00:22:05,417 --> 00:22:07,982
It looked better
where it was before.

369
00:22:08,024 --> 00:22:10,155
I thought you might want to know

370
00:22:10,197 --> 00:22:12,762
the <i>Lexington</i> docked
a few minutes ago.

371
00:22:12,805 --> 00:22:14,435
Already?

372
00:22:14,477 --> 00:22:18,215
Oh, I thought it wasn't coming
for another day or two.

373
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:20,625
She's in Quark's.

374
00:22:25,142 --> 00:22:26,737
Oh, okay.

375
00:22:38,014 --> 00:22:40,818
Are you going
to talk to her or not?

376
00:22:40,855 --> 00:22:42,485
She's busy.

377
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,659
You never mentioned
she was beautiful.

378
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,569
I never mentioned her at all

379
00:22:46,606 --> 00:22:47,836
not to you, anyway.

380
00:22:47,876 --> 00:22:50,110
Morn gave me three-to-one odds
that you'll exchange

381
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:52,419
awkward pleasantries
for a few minutes

382
00:22:52,457 --> 00:22:53,859
then say good-bye.

383
00:22:53,894 --> 00:22:58,841
I'm betting that your charm
will take you further.

384
00:23:02,654 --> 00:23:04,318
Okay then.

385
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:05,487
In the ship?

386
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:07,695
She's getting up.

387
00:23:56,783 --> 00:23:58,253
So, what do you think?

388
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,489
I liked it.

389
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:04,300
You're not just saying that?

390
00:24:04,339 --> 00:24:06,436
No, no, no.

391
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:08,473
It's good.

392
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:12,964
What do you think
about the part

393
00:24:12,998 --> 00:24:15,301
where Jared thinks
he's been betrayed?

394
00:24:15,338 --> 00:24:18,472
I don't think that he would
confront him with it.

395
00:24:18,514 --> 00:24:19,814
Not right away.

396
00:24:19,852 --> 00:24:21,152
Yeah, I guess he could wait

397
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,994
until he gets back
from the Demilitarized Zone.

398
00:24:24,031 --> 00:24:25,935
Yeah, that'd make it
more believable.

399
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,098
Hmm.

400
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,374
So, you really think
it was good, huh?

401
00:24:29,414 --> 00:24:31,853
I think it shows
a lot of promise.

402
00:24:34,329 --> 00:24:36,061
What?

403
00:24:38,407 --> 00:24:39,843
Promise?

404
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:42,512
In a few places,
you're writing about things

405
00:24:42,553 --> 00:24:44,548
you haven't actually experienced

406
00:24:44,592 --> 00:24:47,157
or at least I hope
you haven't experienced.

407
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,472
Unless you've joined the Maquis
without telling me.

408
00:24:53,286 --> 00:24:55,520
I can't talk about it.

409
00:25:00,574 --> 00:25:03,743
I had you going there.

410
00:25:06,425 --> 00:25:08,796
Jake, I really am impressed.

411
00:25:08,832 --> 00:25:11,066
I think you should
keep writing.

412
00:25:11,105 --> 00:25:12,735
I'm thinking about it.

413
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:15,273
Don't think about it,
just do it.

414
00:25:20,801 --> 00:25:22,796
What I... what I mean is...

415
00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:26,451
Yesterday, I got a communication

416
00:25:26,485 --> 00:25:29,084
from the Pennington School
in New Zealand

417
00:25:29,126 --> 00:25:31,429
and, uh...

418
00:25:31,466 --> 00:25:33,837
they offered me
a writing fellowship.

419
00:25:33,874 --> 00:25:37,818
Oh, well, Jake, that...

420
00:25:37,852 --> 00:25:39,152
that's terrific.

421
00:25:39,189 --> 00:25:40,659
I, uh...

422
00:25:40,694 --> 00:25:42,495
I didn't realize
you had applied.

423
00:25:42,533 --> 00:25:43,833
Well I-I didn't, really.

424
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,899
What happened is,
I showed a story I wrote

425
00:25:45,943 --> 00:25:47,345
to Mrs. O'Brien.

426
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:49,250
I guess she liked it,
because she showed it

427
00:25:49,286 --> 00:25:51,919
to a friend of hers who knows
someone at the school, and...

428
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:06,757
A mast support gave way.

429
00:26:06,801 --> 00:26:09,206
The starboard sprit
is fouling one of the mainsails.

430
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,210
Can we fix it?

431
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:11,407
I don't think so.

432
00:26:11,449 --> 00:26:13,353
We're going to have
to jettison the sprit.

433
00:26:13,388 --> 00:26:14,482
Let's fall off a little.

434
00:26:14,525 --> 00:26:16,018
Take some pressure
off the sails.

435
00:26:16,063 --> 00:26:17,658
Lock that down
and give me a hand.

436
00:26:27,664 --> 00:26:29,328
One more turn.

437
00:26:33,348 --> 00:26:34,818
Lock it!

438
00:26:34,852 --> 00:26:36,152
Good work.

439
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:38,185
I'm going to jettison the sprit.

440
00:26:48,393 --> 00:26:50,194
That's better

441
00:26:50,232 --> 00:26:54,336
but we're still getting
a lot of spill off the sails.

442
00:26:54,411 --> 00:26:59,153
We won't be able to make
much headway with each tack.

443
00:26:59,192 --> 00:27:01,096
I don't think we'll be able

444
00:27:01,131 --> 00:27:03,764
to get to the Denorios Belt
like this.

445
00:27:03,806 --> 00:27:04,900
The ancient Bajorans

446
00:27:04,942 --> 00:27:07,245
probably ran into
these kinds of problems.

447
00:27:07,283 --> 00:27:09,448
I suppose they did.

448
00:27:09,489 --> 00:27:12,054
Well, did they give up
and go home?

449
00:27:13,969 --> 00:27:16,602
It seems to me, we're here
to prove that they didn't.

450
00:27:16,644 --> 00:27:18,548
What are we waiting for?

451
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,481
Let's get to work.

452
00:27:21,525 --> 00:27:23,257
Lay out the port sprit.

453
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:30,608
Coming about.

454
00:27:39,747 --> 00:27:47,294
Bring me my chariots of fire

455
00:27:47,336 --> 00:27:55,761
I will not cease
from mental fight

456
00:27:55,795 --> 00:28:03,616
Nor shall my sword
sleep in my hand

457
00:28:03,652 --> 00:28:11,803
Till we have built Jerusalem

458
00:28:11,843 --> 00:28:19,594
In England's green
and pleasant land.

459
00:28:19,632 --> 00:28:21,159
Ha!

460
00:28:21,204 --> 00:28:22,834
That was really beautiful,
Chief.

461
00:28:22,876 --> 00:28:24,574
You know what we should do?

462
00:28:24,614 --> 00:28:26,050
What?

463
00:28:26,085 --> 00:28:29,823
We should go to Quark's
and sing it for everybody.

464
00:28:29,863 --> 00:28:33,203
Oh, no. I-I-I think
we should switch to synthale.

465
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,405
No, no, this isn't...

466
00:28:37,085 --> 00:28:39,057
a synthale kind of night.

467
00:28:45,443 --> 00:28:48,110
She walked right past me, Chief.

468
00:28:48,151 --> 00:28:50,784
Acted like I wasn't even there.

469
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:54,460
Do you know what I think?

470
00:28:54,504 --> 00:28:55,872
What?

471
00:28:55,908 --> 00:28:58,747
I think she's in love with you.

472
00:29:00,087 --> 00:29:01,717
I don't think so.

473
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:04,255
It's the only explanation.

474
00:29:05,771 --> 00:29:07,264
Unless...

475
00:29:11,288 --> 00:29:13,853
Unless she really ignored you

476
00:29:13,895 --> 00:29:16,460
because she can't stand you.

477
00:29:18,309 --> 00:29:22,117
Isn't there some explanation
in between?

478
00:29:22,153 --> 00:29:23,783
Well...

479
00:29:23,825 --> 00:29:28,294
you're not
an in-between kind of guy.

480
00:29:28,339 --> 00:29:30,140
What do you mean?

481
00:29:30,177 --> 00:29:33,175
Well, people either
love you or hate you.

482
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,990
Really?

483
00:29:36,028 --> 00:29:41,341
I mean, I hated you
when we first met.

484
00:29:41,378 --> 00:29:44,182
I remember.

485
00:29:44,219 --> 00:29:45,553
But now...

486
00:29:49,234 --> 00:29:50,932
And now?

487
00:29:53,212 --> 00:29:56,711
Well... now I don't.

488
00:30:00,635 --> 00:30:01,695
That means a lot to me, Chief.

489
00:30:01,805 --> 00:30:02,865
It really does.

490
00:30:02,909 --> 00:30:04,345
Really!

491
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,409
Now...

492
00:30:06,453 --> 00:30:10,397
that is from the heart, huh?

493
00:30:10,431 --> 00:30:12,232
Huh? I really do.

494
00:30:14,075 --> 00:30:16,548
Not hate you anymore.

495
00:30:18,856 --> 00:30:20,987
Hey, do you know what I think?

496
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,295
What?

497
00:30:25,443 --> 00:30:29,912
If you want to know
why she ignored you

498
00:30:29,956 --> 00:30:32,760
you have got to confront her.

499
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:34,793
You're right.

500
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:38,073
I got to go right up to her...

501
00:30:40,621 --> 00:30:43,060
and ask her flat out

502
00:30:43,096 --> 00:30:48,568
where she gets off
walking past me like that.

503
00:30:48,612 --> 00:30:50,607
Better wait until tomorrow.

504
00:30:50,651 --> 00:30:51,711
Why?

505
00:30:51,754 --> 00:30:54,353
Why not right now?

506
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:59,172
Because you can barely
stand up right now.

507
00:31:01,416 --> 00:31:04,619
Good point.
Good point.

508
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,461
Good point.

509
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:18,031
And did those feet,
in ancient time

510
00:31:18,067 --> 00:31:22,536
Walk upon England's
mountains...

511
00:31:30,738 --> 00:31:31,832
Lock it.

512
00:31:31,874 --> 00:31:34,370
Coming about.

513
00:31:36,121 --> 00:31:37,557
Now.

514
00:31:43,442 --> 00:31:44,536
Good.

515
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,776
Solid job.

516
00:31:45,816 --> 00:31:47,480
Let's take a break.

517
00:31:47,521 --> 00:31:49,493
String up the hammock.

518
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:52,894
Hammock time.

519
00:31:52,937 --> 00:31:54,099
Yo!

520
00:32:00,226 --> 00:32:02,130
Hop in.

521
00:32:02,166 --> 00:32:03,294
Phew!

522
00:32:03,336 --> 00:32:04,806
Oh!

523
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,778
Nice.

524
00:32:06,813 --> 00:32:08,283
Whoa!

525
00:32:08,317 --> 00:32:09,445
I'm okay.

526
00:32:09,487 --> 00:32:10,752
Comfortable, isn't it?

527
00:32:10,791 --> 00:32:11,953
I'm fine. Yeah.

528
00:32:12,061 --> 00:32:14,056
Yeah, we'll make
a sailor of you yet.

529
00:32:14,101 --> 00:32:15,936
I suppose congratulations
are in order.

530
00:32:15,973 --> 00:32:17,534
Pennington is a good school...

531
00:32:17,578 --> 00:32:18,980
and very competitive.

532
00:32:19,015 --> 00:32:20,713
Dad, before you say anything

533
00:32:20,755 --> 00:32:22,750
I'm turning down the fellowship.

534
00:32:22,794 --> 00:32:23,990
Turning it down?
Why?

535
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,728
I'm just... not ready to go.

536
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:27,537
Jake, an opportunity
like this

537
00:32:27,574 --> 00:32:29,877
doesn't come along every day.

538
00:32:29,915 --> 00:32:31,819
I can defer admission
for a year.

539
00:32:31,854 --> 00:32:33,826
If I want to go then,
I still can.

540
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,829
Well, that's fine

541
00:32:34,863 --> 00:32:36,994
but why will things be
different in a year?

542
00:32:37,036 --> 00:32:38,005
I don't know.

543
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,703
They just might be, that's all.

544
00:32:42,821 --> 00:32:44,348
Now, remember, Jake.

545
00:32:44,392 --> 00:32:47,835
I wasn't much older than you
when I left for San Francisco

546
00:32:47,869 --> 00:32:49,636
to go to Starfleet Academy.

547
00:32:49,674 --> 00:32:52,706
For the first few days,
I was so homesick

548
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,589
that I'd go back
to my house in New Orleans

549
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:57,220
every night for dinner.

550
00:32:58,802 --> 00:33:01,401
I'd materialize
in my living room

551
00:33:01,443 --> 00:33:03,540
at 6:30 every night

552
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:07,994
and take my seat at the table,
just like I had come downstairs.

553
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:09,499
You must have used up

554
00:33:09,534 --> 00:33:12,338
a month's worth
of transporter credits.

555
00:33:12,376 --> 00:33:13,744
Hmm.

556
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:17,450
My parents, they never said
anything about it.

557
00:33:17,491 --> 00:33:21,093
Just "How you doing, son?
How was school today?"

558
00:33:21,135 --> 00:33:25,239
They knew that I would get over
being homesick soon enough.

559
00:33:25,281 --> 00:33:27,948
Well, after about the
fifth, sixth day

560
00:33:27,989 --> 00:33:30,862
you couldn't pry me
from that campus.

561
00:33:30,898 --> 00:33:33,132
Of course now, if you go
to Pennington

562
00:33:33,171 --> 00:33:36,146
you won't be able to beam
back to the station

563
00:33:36,213 --> 00:33:38,412
to have dinner
with your old man.

564
00:33:38,454 --> 00:33:42,022
After about a week or so,
you'll get over it.

565
00:33:47,949 --> 00:33:50,080
It's not me I'm worried about.

566
00:33:51,593 --> 00:33:52,687
It's you.

567
00:33:52,729 --> 00:33:54,165
Me?

568
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,001
Well, if I go,
you'll be all alone.

569
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,513
Well, I appreciate
you thinking about me, Jake

570
00:33:58,547 --> 00:34:01,853
but please don't turn down
this opportunity on my account.

571
00:34:01,891 --> 00:34:03,988
I'll have plenty of people
to keep me company.

572
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:07,473
I can always eat dinner
with Dax or Dr. Bashir

573
00:34:07,507 --> 00:34:11,474
or... even Quark.

574
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:12,749
I guess.

575
00:34:12,789 --> 00:34:15,923
I'd feel a lot better
if you had someone.

576
00:34:15,966 --> 00:34:19,465
You know, someone special,
like a girlfriend.

577
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,536
I see.

578
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,609
Well, let's face it.

579
00:34:22,652 --> 00:34:25,182
It's been over a year
since your last date.

580
00:34:25,227 --> 00:34:26,218
A year, Dad.

581
00:34:28,737 --> 00:34:30,766
Well, you got to make time
for these things.

582
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:33,751
I cannot believe
that I'm getting advice

583
00:34:33,786 --> 00:34:35,690
about women from my son.

584
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:40,428
Don't think of me
as your son right now.

585
00:34:40,473 --> 00:34:42,171
Just think of me as another guy.

586
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:44,885
Another guy who happens to know

587
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,119
a very attractive lady
who wants to meet you.

588
00:34:49,098 --> 00:34:52,506
You are trying to set me up?

589
00:34:53,545 --> 00:34:54,605
Why not?

590
00:34:56,855 --> 00:34:58,085
What was that?

591
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,494
I'm not sure,
but whatever hit us

592
00:35:01,536 --> 00:35:03,303
almost tore off
the port mainsail.

593
00:35:35,756 --> 00:35:37,192
Main power is off-line.

594
00:35:37,227 --> 00:35:38,492
We're moving at warp.

595
00:35:38,531 --> 00:35:39,522
How can that be?

596
00:35:39,567 --> 00:35:41,128
I don't know.

597
00:35:44,582 --> 00:35:46,451
What happened?

598
00:35:48,795 --> 00:35:50,493
That's a good question.

599
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:58,782
There's no record

600
00:35:58,891 --> 00:36:01,125
of any spatial anomalies
in this region.

601
00:36:01,165 --> 00:36:02,134
What are these?

602
00:36:02,168 --> 00:36:03,364
Tachyon eddies.

603
00:36:03,405 --> 00:36:05,069
They run all through this area.

604
00:36:05,111 --> 00:36:07,083
Could we have gotten
caught up in one?

605
00:36:07,117 --> 00:36:09,282
No, tachyons don't
have enough mass

606
00:36:09,323 --> 00:36:11,762
to affect a ship of...

607
00:36:15,809 --> 00:36:17,906
This... isn't

608
00:36:17,948 --> 00:36:20,752
an ordinary ship.

609
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:24,700
It has a lot more surface area
relative to its mass.

610
00:36:24,736 --> 00:36:25,932
Because of the sails.

611
00:36:25,972 --> 00:36:29,346
And since tachyons
travel faster than light

612
00:36:29,383 --> 00:36:32,655
it could be that their impact
on the sails

613
00:36:32,693 --> 00:36:35,725
somehow accelerated us
to warp speeds.

614
00:36:36,972 --> 00:36:39,411
We could be light-years
off course.

615
00:36:41,084 --> 00:36:44,527
The question is...
where did we end up?

616
00:36:44,561 --> 00:36:46,624
You check the rigging.

617
00:36:46,668 --> 00:36:49,301
I'll try to figure that out.

618
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,250
We lost the jib
and port mainsail.

619
00:36:59,506 --> 00:37:00,532
Damn!

620
00:37:00,576 --> 00:37:02,343
What?

621
00:37:03,618 --> 00:37:04,848
It's useless.

622
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:07,087
Now we can't figure out
where we are

623
00:37:07,129 --> 00:37:08,429
or where we're going.

624
00:37:08,466 --> 00:37:10,871
Guess we'll have to contact
the station.

625
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:13,607
Let them know they have
to come and get us.

626
00:37:16,825 --> 00:37:18,090
We were so close.

627
00:37:18,128 --> 00:37:20,898
Another day and we
would have made it

628
00:37:20,937 --> 00:37:22,532
to the Denorios Belt.

629
00:37:22,575 --> 00:37:26,040
Hey, we did pretty well
getting as far as we did.

630
00:37:27,991 --> 00:37:29,461
Is something wrong?

631
00:37:29,496 --> 00:37:31,695
The station's not responding.

632
00:37:31,736 --> 00:37:33,571
Is the com unit damaged?

633
00:37:33,608 --> 00:37:35,580
Not as far as I can see.

634
00:37:37,085 --> 00:37:39,114
Maybe they haven't
received our message yet.

635
00:37:39,158 --> 00:37:41,825
Do you think we could have
been carried that far away

636
00:37:41,867 --> 00:37:43,531
from the station?

637
00:37:43,571 --> 00:37:44,973
I suppose it's possible.

638
00:37:46,614 --> 00:37:49,886
Well... they'll
find us eventually.

639
00:37:49,924 --> 00:37:51,326
Right?

640
00:37:53,167 --> 00:37:54,831
Sure.

641
00:38:27,302 --> 00:38:28,897
Excuse me.

642
00:38:28,941 --> 00:38:30,035
Yes?

643
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,349
We were at medical
school together.

644
00:38:35,059 --> 00:38:37,156
Julian Bashir.

645
00:38:38,703 --> 00:38:40,333
You're Bashir?

646
00:38:40,374 --> 00:38:42,072
You sound surprised.

647
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:45,280
Well, I thought
you were Andorian.

648
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,657
Andorian?

649
00:38:46,694 --> 00:38:50,604
Someone pointed out
an Andorian to me at a party

650
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:53,112
and said
that that was Julian Bashir.

651
00:38:53,213 --> 00:38:55,048
It was, um, New Year's Eve

652
00:38:55,086 --> 00:38:57,355
at Bruce Lucier's
four years ago.

653
00:38:57,392 --> 00:38:59,922
Well, I did go to that party.
May I?

654
00:38:59,967 --> 00:39:01,802
Yes.

655
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,777
With my friend, Erib.

656
00:39:03,811 --> 00:39:05,247
Now, he's Andorian.

657
00:39:05,282 --> 00:39:06,650
No, thank you.

658
00:39:06,687 --> 00:39:08,625
I must have gotten
you mixed up.

659
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:12,000
All these years, I thought
you were someone else.

660
00:39:12,037 --> 00:39:14,772
Didn't you see me give
my speech at graduation?

661
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:18,379
No, I was back stage,
waiting to give my speech.

662
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:20,793
I was so nervous,
I almost passed out.

663
00:39:20,829 --> 00:39:23,998
I know the feeling.

664
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:26,672
So, you gave me
quite a run for my money.

665
00:39:26,714 --> 00:39:29,986
If it hadn't been
for that preganglionic fiber...

666
00:39:30,024 --> 00:39:31,962
You know about that.

667
00:39:31,996 --> 00:39:34,333
I know that if you
hadn't got that wrong

668
00:39:34,369 --> 00:39:36,638
you would be valedictorian.

669
00:39:36,677 --> 00:39:39,481
Well, I never got a chance
to congratulate you.

670
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:42,688
It seems like
a long time ago, doesn't it?

671
00:39:42,728 --> 00:39:45,065
Not so long.

672
00:39:46,205 --> 00:39:48,040
So, you got the <i>Lexington.</i>

673
00:39:48,078 --> 00:39:50,574
You must have had
quite an adventure

674
00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:52,557
exploring uncharted space

675
00:39:52,591 --> 00:39:54,426
meeting fascinating
new species

676
00:39:54,463 --> 00:39:56,230
with fascinating
new diseases.

677
00:39:56,302 --> 00:39:59,745
Actually, it ended up being
more of a charting expedition.

678
00:39:59,779 --> 00:40:03,153
Sometimes it would be months
between planetary systems.

679
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:05,857
You wouldn't believe
how excited I would get

680
00:40:05,897 --> 00:40:08,131
if we actually found
something living

681
00:40:08,171 --> 00:40:10,542
even if it was just moss
under a rock.

682
00:40:15,694 --> 00:40:19,137
Don't take this the wrong way,
but... there were times

683
00:40:19,171 --> 00:40:22,044
when I regretted
not taking your assignment.

684
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,709
Really?

685
00:40:23,751 --> 00:40:26,316
I read your paper
on the immunotherapy project

686
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:28,830
you've been doing on Bajor.

687
00:40:28,866 --> 00:40:30,427
It was brilliant.

688
00:40:30,471 --> 00:40:31,736
Thank you.

689
00:40:31,775 --> 00:40:34,750
I really envy
the opportunity you have

690
00:40:34,784 --> 00:40:37,257
to work on that kind
of long-term project.

691
00:40:37,292 --> 00:40:38,283
On the <i>Lexington</i>

692
00:40:38,328 --> 00:40:40,026
it was collect your samples

693
00:40:40,066 --> 00:40:42,004
and then on to the next system.

694
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,566
I suppose I was lucky...

695
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,103
What's happening on Bajor?

696
00:40:45,149 --> 00:40:48,181
Were you able to get the T cell
anomalies under control?

697
00:40:48,224 --> 00:40:50,355
If you're really that interested

698
00:40:50,397 --> 00:40:52,392
we should go to the Infirmary

699
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:55,000
and I can show you
my latest results.

700
00:40:55,044 --> 00:40:56,708
I'd love it.

701
00:41:04,172 --> 00:41:05,608
Morn, about that bet.

702
00:41:05,642 --> 00:41:08,207
I believe the odds
were three to one.

703
00:41:23,468 --> 00:41:24,562
So, Dad...

704
00:41:24,604 --> 00:41:26,405
we're not going
to run out of air

705
00:41:26,444 --> 00:41:27,744
or anything, are we?

706
00:41:27,781 --> 00:41:29,149
Don't worry.

707
00:41:29,185 --> 00:41:31,248
Somebody will find us
before that happens.

708
00:41:31,292 --> 00:41:32,522
Hmm.

709
00:41:34,568 --> 00:41:36,129
So...

710
00:41:36,172 --> 00:41:38,907
tell me about this woman
you want me to meet.

711
00:41:38,948 --> 00:41:40,509
Well...

712
00:41:40,552 --> 00:41:42,649
she's a freighter Captain.

713
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:46,202
A freighter Captain.

714
00:41:46,236 --> 00:41:47,262
Well, Dad, trust me.

715
00:41:47,306 --> 00:41:48,536
You'll like her.

716
00:41:49,746 --> 00:41:50,874
All right.

717
00:41:50,917 --> 00:41:52,946
I'll agree to meet her,
on one condition.

718
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:54,050
What?

719
00:41:54,126 --> 00:41:56,656
That you agree not
to base your decision

720
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:59,766
about going to Pennington
on how our date turns out.

721
00:41:59,811 --> 00:42:00,780
Don't worry.

722
00:42:00,814 --> 00:42:02,182
I won't.

723
00:42:02,217 --> 00:42:05,192
I've already decided
to wait at least a year.

724
00:42:05,226 --> 00:42:06,252
Why?

725
00:42:06,297 --> 00:42:07,665
Well...

726
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:13,850
I've heard
that you can only write

727
00:42:13,886 --> 00:42:16,051
about what you've experienced.

728
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,393
And you-you got to admit

729
00:42:18,433 --> 00:42:21,636
Deep Space 9 is a pretty
good place to get experience.

730
00:42:30,669 --> 00:42:31,797
Dad.

731
00:42:37,557 --> 00:42:39,962
It appears we've got company.

732
00:42:41,067 --> 00:42:43,005
What do you think they want?

733
00:42:44,343 --> 00:42:47,010
Hmm. Looks like we're
about to find out.

734
00:42:51,398 --> 00:42:53,461
What can I do for you, Dukat?

735
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:56,947
Well, I wanted to be the
first one to congratulate you.

736
00:42:56,982 --> 00:42:59,923
Congratulate me?

737
00:42:59,957 --> 00:43:03,731
On managing to make it
all the way here.

738
00:43:03,768 --> 00:43:05,136
All the way where?

739
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:06,367
Don't you know?

740
00:43:06,409 --> 00:43:09,852
You've just entered
the Cardassian system.

741
00:43:14,166 --> 00:43:15,328
The tachyon eddy.

742
00:43:15,369 --> 00:43:18,002
It must have taken us
past the Denorios Belt

743
00:43:18,045 --> 00:43:19,275
and brought us here.

744
00:43:19,314 --> 00:43:21,309
The same thing
must have happened

745
00:43:21,354 --> 00:43:22,847
to the ancient Bajorans.

746
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:24,020
We did it!

747
00:43:24,063 --> 00:43:26,332
We proved the trip
was possible.

748
00:43:26,369 --> 00:43:29,743
I hate to interrupt
your celebration, Commander

749
00:43:29,779 --> 00:43:31,409
but I've been asked

750
00:43:31,451 --> 00:43:35,225
to convey a message
from the Cardassian government.

751
00:43:35,329 --> 00:43:37,528
"Your voyage is a testament

752
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:39,735
"to the spirit
of the ancient Bajorans

753
00:43:39,776 --> 00:43:42,683
"who first ventured
out into space.

754
00:43:42,718 --> 00:43:45,055
"It could not be
more appropriate

755
00:43:45,092 --> 00:43:47,030
"that your arrival coincides

756
00:43:47,065 --> 00:43:50,268
"with the discovery
here on Cardassia

757
00:43:50,341 --> 00:43:52,610
"of an ancient crash site...

758
00:43:52,648 --> 00:43:55,452
"a site that our
archaeologists believe

759
00:43:55,489 --> 00:43:58,487
"contains the remnants
of one of the Bajoran vessels

760
00:43:58,533 --> 00:44:03,378
whose journey
you have just recreated."

761
00:44:03,413 --> 00:44:06,445
What an amazing coincidence.

762
00:44:06,489 --> 00:44:10,057
Yes, isn't it?

763
00:44:14,011 --> 00:44:15,447
Welcome.
