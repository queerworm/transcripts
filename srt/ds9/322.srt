00:00:01,961 --> 00:00:05,005
(<i> buzz of conversation</i> )

2
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,521
Excuse me.

3
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:24,650
You're Dr. Bashir,
aren't you?

4
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,651
That's right. 

5
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:27,361
I'm Leeta.

6
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:30,614
I've been meaning to come
by the Infirmary to see you.

7
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:33,659
(<i> coughs</i> )

8
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:35,369
Oh, dear.

9
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,830
How long have
you had that cough?

10
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,748
A few days now.

11
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,293
May I?

12
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,172
Cough for me.

13
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,218
(<i> coughs</i> )

14
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,219
Hmm...

15
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,971
Is it serious,
Doctor?

16
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,597
No, but it's
a good thing

17
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,140
you came to me
when you did.

18
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,518
We need to start your
treatment immediately.

19
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:00,853
Bring me
a Fanalian toddy

20
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:02,479
very hot.

21
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,023
Make that two.

22
00:01:04,023 --> 00:01:05,774
I'm feeling a bit of a cough
coming on, myself.

23
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:09,862
I'm... sorry to
hear that, Doctor.

24
00:01:09,862 --> 00:01:11,488
No, please.

25
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,614
Call me...

26
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:13,741
Julian.

27
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,409
Hi.

28
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,578
I'm Jadzia.

29
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,371
Leeta.

30
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:21,540
Before I forget...

31
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,461
here's that immunological
data you asked for.

32
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,840
How nice of you

33
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,425
to put it together
for me so quickly.

34
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:35,596
I, uh... I think I'll
go over it right now.

35
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,307
Oh, by the way

36
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:42,603
I hear the<i> Lexington</i>
is docking here

37
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,103
for a few days.

38
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:45,522
The<i> Lexington?</i>

39
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,695
Excuse me, um...

40
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,530
for just one second.

41
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,241
Stay there.

42
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,160
Jadzia!

43
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:05,125
Do you happen to know when
the<i> Lexington</i> is coming in?

44
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,877
Three weeks.

45
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,879
Don't you have a friend aboard?

46
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,130
Do I?

47
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,009
The Medical Officer--
Elizabeth Lense.

48
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,177
Elizabeth Lense...

49
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,222
You know, I think
she may have been

50
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,141
in my class
at Starfleet Medical.

51
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,893
Wasn't she valedictorian?

52
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:24,269
That's right.

53
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,563
And you were
salutatorian.

54
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,107
Second in my class.

55
00:02:28,107 --> 00:02:31,693
But if I hadn't mistaken
that preganglionic fiber...

56
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:34,529
For a postganglionic nerve--
um, I know.

57
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,450
I would have been valedictorian.

58
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,202
You must be looking forward
to seeing her.

59
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:44,039
I can hardly wait.

60
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,338
Hey, Jake-o.

61
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,340
Hey, Dad.

62
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:58,679
Hey!

63
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:03,642
What is this?

64
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:06,103
I thought it was
time for a change.

65
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,395
What do you think?

66
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,438
I like it.

67
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,397
Yeah.

68
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:10,732
How was Bajor?

69
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,442
Beautiful! You should
have come with me.

70
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,944
The reopening
of some old library

71
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:15,863
isn't exactly my idea
of a good time.

72
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:18,032
This wasn't just
some old library.

73
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:20,450
We're talking about the
most extensive collection

74
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,744
of Bajoran antiquities
on the planet.

75
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,204
I saw manuscripts
that dated back

76
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:28,207
to before the fall
of the First Republic.

77
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:29,835
Great.

78
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:31,086
Here...

79
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,546
look at this.

80
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,965
What is this,
some kind of ship?

81
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,424
According to legend,

82
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,552
the ancient Bajorans
used ships like these

83
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:39,887
to explore their star system

84
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,222
800 years ago.

85
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,849
You mean
that when humans

86
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:46,476
were first sailing
across the oceans,

87
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,395
Bajorans were already
going to other planets?

88
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,688
Some scholars say

89
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,899
they made it all
the way to Cardassia.

90
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,984
Ah, that seems hard
to believe.

91
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,360
What are these?

92
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,238
Solar sails.

93
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:02,242
These ships were propelled
by light pressure.

94
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,494
Like a sailboat
catching the wind.

95
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,621
Exactly.

96
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,041
I wonder if a ship like that

97
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,625
could really fly.

98
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,294
I don't know.

99
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:16,339
That's why I'm going
to build one.

100
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:19,171
I'm expecting
a lumber shipment

101
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:20,881
from Bajor
this afternoon.

102
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,216
Okay.

103
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:24,467
Which reminds me--
I'll need a saber saw.

104
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,886
A saber saw?

105
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,387
You know, to cut wood.

106
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,598
Why not use
a laser cutter?

107
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,184
Oh, no, I
want to use

108
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:35,603
the same types of tools
the Bajorans had.

109
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,480
This will do fine, Major.

110
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,858
As soon as these cargo
containers are out of the way,

111
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,400
I'll start construction.

112
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,029
Sir, I've looked over
the specifications

113
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:46,031
you brought back
from Bajor.

114
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,867
I'm not sure this design
is spaceworthy,

115
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,327
and I'm positive
a ship like this

116
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,079
could never have made it
from Bajor to Cardassia.

117
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,788
Now, why would
you say that?

118
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:54,956
At sublight speeds,

119
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,666
the trip would
have taken them years,

120
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,626
and that's assuming
ideal conditions.

121
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,254
One unexpected
ion storm

122
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:01,922
in the Denorios Belt
would have torn

123
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,007
the sails to pieces
and left them stranded.

124
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,384
Well, maybe
they were lucky

125
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:06,927
and they didn't
go into any storms.

126
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,303
O'BRIEN:
I just don't see

127
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:09,721
how this ship could
have made the trip.

128
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,514
They didn't even have
replicators back then.

129
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,267
They would have had
to store their air supply.

130
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:14,893
And there's only room
on board

131
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,228
for a few weeks' worth.

132
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:18,146
Well, maybe they
recycled it somehow--

133
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,565
used some kind of
photosynthetic plant.

134
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:21,816
Yeah, maybe.

135
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,902
Oh, you sound just
like a Cardassian.

136
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,028
I beg your pardon?

137
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,487
They have denied
the possibility

138
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,240
of ancient contact
for decades,

139
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,991
because they cannot
stand the idea

140
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,868
of Bajor having
interstellar flight

141
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,203
before they did.

142
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,579
With all due respect, Major,

143
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,914
you're beginning to sound
like a Romulan.

144
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:36,873
A Romulan!

145
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,417
O'BRIEN:
There is no piece

146
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:40,377
of technology in existence
they don't claim

147
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,878
they invented
before everyone else.

148
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,505
Look, I don't plan to spend
the next few years

149
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:45,882
sailing to Cardassia.

150
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,260
All I want is to build
one of these ships

151
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,345
and prove
that it's spaceworthy.

152
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,597
A computer model
could do that.

153
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,474
Why go to all
that trouble?

154
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,516
Why?

155
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:58,145
Because it'll be fun.

156
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,671
(<i> sighs</i> )

157
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,311
(<i> grunts</i> )

158
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,079
(<i> sighs</i> )

159
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,456
Oh, yes.

160
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,835
You know, I've been thinking.

161
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,628
According to the star charts,

162
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,006
the most difficult part
of the trip

163
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,799
between Bajor and Cardassia

164
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,843
would be getting through
the Denorios Belt.

165
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:14,429
After that, it would be smooth
sailing the rest of the way.

166
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:15,805
Really?

167
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,933
Just making that part
of the trip would go

168
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,144
a long way towards demonstrating
that the Bajorans

169
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,646
could have made
the journey to Cardassia.

170
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,024
Seems reasonable.

171
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:30,111
It should only take
about four, five days.

172
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:32,739
That's not so long.

173
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,115
So?

174
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,409
What?

175
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:36,617
So, what do you say
you come with me?

176
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,328
We'll have a great time.

177
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,580
The ship will be ready to go
in another week.

178
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,084
That's when Leanne is supposed
to be getting back from Bajor.

179
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,585
I really want to see her,

180
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,004
and I don't know
how long she's going to be here.

181
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,631
Oh, well...

182
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:51,925
if you can't do it...

183
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:55,011
you can't do it.

184
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:58,223
I'd like to, but...

185
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,975
it's just not good timing,
you know.

186
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:03,562
Sure.

187
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:05,146
I understand.

188
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,657
(<i> sparks crackling</i> )

189
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,502
Hi!

190
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:28,753
Oh, hello, Jadzia.

191
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,838
I brought you
something to eat.

192
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,173
Oh, thank you.

193
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,508
Let me just finish
this welding,

194
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,718
and I'll take a break.

195
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,220
Benjamin, I
can't believe

196
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,139
the work you've
put into this.

197
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,516
I'm just following
the blueprint.

198
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:43,768
But you didn't
have to bother

199
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,103
with detail like this

200
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:48,022
to prove that the
ship is spaceworthy.

201
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,608
Oh, I suppose not,

202
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:52,110
but I want everything
to be just right.

203
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,778
It's an exact replica,
you know

204
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:57,282
except for the gravity net
that I installed in the floor.

205
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:58,783
Weightlessness
makes me queasy.

206
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,452
(<i> laughs</i> )

207
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:03,538
Ooh, I haven't seen you
like this for a long time.

208
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,081
Like what?

209
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,874
So caught up
in something.

210
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,042
So excited.

211
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,462
Not since, um...

212
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:13,881
not since you and Jennifer
decided to have a baby.

213
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,342
Ah, the nursery.

214
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:18,011
I don't think anyone's
ever put such effort

215
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,305
into making a room
for their child.

216
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:23,350
Well, you have to admit,
it turned out pretty well.

217
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,683
Oh...

218
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:27,312
especially the starscape
on the ceiling.

219
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,272
Yeah, Jake loved that ceiling.

220
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,690
In fact, when we
moved out of the house,

221
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,819
he couldn't understand why
we couldn't bring it with us.

222
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,073
You're disappointed
he's not going with you

223
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,659
on this trip, aren't you?

224
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:43,620
Well, he has other things
he'd rather be doing.

225
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,665
Friends he'd rather be with.

226
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:48,291
It's funny...

227
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,793
a year or two ago, nothing
would have stopped him

228
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,796
from coming with me
on an adventure like this.

229
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,425
I guess I waited too long.

230
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,678
You'll have other adventures,
Benjamin.

231
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:01,095
They'll just be different.

232
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,639
Believe me, I know.

233
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,931
I've been a father

234
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,350
a couple of
times myself.

235
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,687
Oh, I could tell you stories.

236
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:09,896
You already have.

237
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:13,858
That's right, I have, haven't I?

238
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,194
Then you know I'm right.

239
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:25,953
Computer...

240
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,581
are there any messages for me?

241
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:29,040
COMPUTER: One.

242
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,500
A communication
from Wellington, New Zealand.

243
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,586
Display it on screen.

(<i> sighs</i> )

245
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,533
Hello.

246
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:04,951
Welcome aboard, son.

247
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,286
Hey, Dad.

248
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,204
So...

249
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,748
what do you think?

250
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:11,332
Well, it's wonderful.

251
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,335
Maybe a bit small for
two people, but, uh...

252
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:17,464
I think I could
get used to it.

253
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:20,174
That is, uh, if you
still want me along.

254
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,890
(<i> chuckles</i> )

255
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:44,365
Oh...

256
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,076
<i>"A Survey of Cygnian</i>
<i>Respiratory Diseases"?</i>

257
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,453
Fascinating.

258
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,371
Yeah, I'm reading
just about everything

259
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,665
I can get my hands on.

260
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,667
I don't want to be
caught flat-footed

261
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,627
by our intrepid
Dr. Lense.

262
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:57,504
It's useless,
of course.

263
00:13:57,504 --> 00:14:00,131
She's probably discovered
the cure to aging by now.

264
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:02,717
I take it the two of you
are competitive?

265
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,260
Absolutely.

266
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,887
We were neck and neck
right until the final exam.

267
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:09,848
Then... I blew it.

268
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:12,018
That's how she wound up
on the<i> Lexington--</i>

269
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,311
a post which virtually everyone

270
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,062
in our graduating class
was hoping for.

271
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,314
Including you?

272
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:20,901
No, this is the assignment
I wanted.

273
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,070
Then what does it matter?

274
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,864
Well, don't
you see?

275
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,157
She could have had this post.

276
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:27,575
She could have taken it from me.

277
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,327
No matter what I accomplish
while I'm here,

278
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:33,498
somehow, that'll always
make me feel...

279
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,291
second best.

280
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:45,134
I understand you're
planning a trip.

281
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,928
Word gets around.

282
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:51,307
I can't believe
that a man of your intelligence

283
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,060
would take stock
in Bajoran fairy tales

284
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,145
about ancient contact.

285
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,147
If you recall,

286
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:01,568
you thought the Celestial Temple
was a Bajoran fairy tale

287
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:04,779
until we discovered
the wormhole.

288
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:07,407
I suggest you
reconsider your plans.

289
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:11,411
Solar vessels are very fragile,
and it's a long way

290
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:14,497
to the Denorios Belt
at sublight speeds.

291
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:15,915
Don't worry.

292
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,084
I'll have emergency equipment
on board.

293
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,711
If something goes wrong,

294
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:22,756
Major Kira can have a runabout
to me within an hour.

295
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:26,008
An hour can be a very long time

296
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:29,637
especially if you happen to
encounter something unexpected.

297
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:30,930
Like what?

298
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,181
Oh, I don't know.

299
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,100
A Maquis ship, perhaps.

300
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,770
Why would the Maquis
have any quarrel

301
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:40,565
with an unarmed ship sailing
toward the Denorios Belt?

302
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:43,943
They have nothing at stake here,
nothing to prove--

303
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,905
or should I say, disprove.

304
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:52,034
Commander, I contacted you
out of concern for your safety,

305
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,870
but you seem to be intimating

306
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,205
that I've made
some sort of threat.

307
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,082
Ah, then I'm glad I was wrong.

308
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:02,211
For a moment there, I thought
that you had been put in charge

309
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,130
of the Cardassian Ministry

310
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,883
for the Refutation
of Bajoran Fairy Tales.

311
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:10,887
Since I don't seem
to be able to dissuade you

312
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:14,348
from undertaking
this little voyage of yours,

313
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,643
I'll wish you luck instead.

314
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:19,520
Let's hope you don't need it.

315
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,416
All right, first, we have
to deploy the mainsails.

316
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,961
I want you to take
that winch right there.

317
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:47,131
Huh? Release brakes.

318
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,676
All right.

319
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,260
When I give
you the word,

320
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,095
crank it with
all you got.

321
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,973
And... now.

322
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,953
That's as far
as they'll go.

323
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,538
Lock it off.

324
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:19,873
All right...

325
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:22,000
let's work on
the spritsails.

326
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,045
Psst.

327
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,421
Oh.

328
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,757
All right, now get
your back into it, huh?

329
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,217
All right.

330
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,681
That's right.

331
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:39,225
We'll make a sailor
out of you yet.

332
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,744
These will trim
the spritsails.

333
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:10,172
Now I get it.

334
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,758
What?

335
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,052
Why you wanted
to build this ship.

336
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:16,846
It is beautiful,
isn't it?

337
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,533
Jake-o.

338
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,620
Trim the starboard sprit
about six degrees.

339
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,080
Okay.

340
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,588
How's that?

341
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:52,339
That should do it.

342
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,341
We'll start
to pick up speed

343
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,594
as the pressure
on the sails builds.

344
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:59,055
Hey, Dad...

345
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,306
where do
we sleep?

346
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,809
We have hammocks
we can string up later.

347
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,018
Is this the bathroom?

348
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:06,687
Yes, it was designed

349
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,606
for a zero-gravity
environment.

350
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:11,859
Well, how am I supposed to...?

351
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,778
How are you supposed to, um...?

352
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:16,196
You'll get the hang of it.

353
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,490
Hmm.

354
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,992
We'll be tacking
against the light

355
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:20,326
most of the way.

356
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,286
And then we'll run like this

357
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,956
for about 90 minutes or so
and come about.

358
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:26,206
And I'll calculate

359
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,625
the next leg
of our trip.

360
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,585
How about something
to drink?

361
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,045
Yeah, sure.

362
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:41,305
Don't tell me we only have
zero-gravity rations.

363
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:44,433
It's all
the ancient Bajorans had.

364
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,859
(<i> sighs</i> )

365
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,445
Listen.

366
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,616
I don't hear anything.

367
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,784
Exactly.

368
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:04,871
Not even the hum of an engine.

369
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:11,335
It's almost like being on
the deck of an old sailing ship.

370
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:15,548
Except the stars
are not just up in the sky,

371
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:18,759
they're all around us.

372
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:23,263
Imagine how the ancient Bajorans
must have felt

373
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:27,185
heading into space
in a ship like this one,

374
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:30,104
not knowing what they
were going to find

375
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:32,606
or who they were
going to meet.

376
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,696
Jake...

377
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:42,909
I know that you really didn't
want to come on this trip.

378
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:49,582
I just want to say,
I'm glad you're here.

379
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:55,713
Dad, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

380
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:58,257
What is it?

381
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:10,144
First, you should read this.

382
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:14,481
It's a story
I wrote.

383
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,025
Ah, a story.

384
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:18,485
That's why you kept
putting this away

385
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,821
every time I walked
into the room, huh?

386
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:28,370
Well, if you'll keep an eye
on the rigging,

387
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,164
I'll read it right now.

388
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:31,707
Deal.

389
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,367
ODO:
It looked better
where it was before.

390
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,203
I thought you might want to know

391
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:12,081
the<i> Lexington</i> docked
a few minutes ago.

392
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,707
Already?

393
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:17,461
Oh, I thought it wasn't coming
for another day or two.

394
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,880
She's in Quark's.

395
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,012
(<i> whispers</i> ):
Oh, okay.

396
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:40,026
Are you going to
talk to her or not?

397
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:41,527
She's busy.

398
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,779
You never mentioned
she was beautiful.

399
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,907
I never mentioned
her at all,
not to you, anyway.

400
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,285
Morn gave me three-to-one odds
that you'll exchange

401
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:51,287
awkward pleasantries
for a few minutes,

402
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,913
then say good-bye.

403
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:58,002
I'm betting that your charm
will take you further.

404
00:22:58,002 --> 00:22:59,419
(<i> snickers</i> )

405
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,341
Okay then.

406
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:04,675
In the ship?

407
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:06,927
She's getting up.

408
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:13,100
See you there.

409
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,310
All right.

410
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,395
So, what do you think?

411
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:01,565
I liked it.

412
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,401
You're not just saying that?

413
00:24:03,401 --> 00:24:05,443
No, no, no.

414
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:07,571
It's good.

415
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:11,992
What do you think
about the part

416
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,494
where Jared thinks
he's been betrayed?

417
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:17,539
I don't think that he would
confront him with it.

418
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:18,624
Not right away.

419
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,251
Yeah, I guess
he could wait

420
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:23,087
until he gets back from
the Demilitarized Zone.

421
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:25,005
Yeah, that'd make it
more believable.

422
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,299
Hmm.

423
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:28,550
So, you really think
it was good, huh?

424
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,970
I think it shows
a lot of promise.

425
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:35,224
What?

426
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:38,769
Promise?

427
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:41,355
In a few places,
you're writing about things

428
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:43,481
you haven't
actually experienced,

429
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:46,193
or at least I hope
you haven't experienced.

430
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:49,487
Unless you've joined the Maquis
without telling me.

431
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:54,534
I can't talk about it.

432
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:02,751
(<i> laughing</i> ):
I had you going there.

433
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,840
Jake, I really am impressed.

434
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,134
I think you should
keep writing.

435
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:11,718
I'm thinking
about it.

436
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:14,472
Don't think about it,
just do it.

437
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,854
What I... what I mean is...

438
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,607
Yesterday, I got a communication

439
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:28,027
from the Pennington School
in New Zealand,

440
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,321
and, uh...

441
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:32,823
they offered me
a writing fellowship.

442
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:36,785
Oh, well, Jake, that...

443
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,245
that's terrific.

444
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,537
I, uh...

445
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:41,499
I didn't realize
you had applied.

446
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:43,000
Well I-I
didn't, really.

447
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,793
What happened is, I
showed a story I wrote

448
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,337
to Mrs. O'Brien.

449
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:48,214
I guess she liked it,
because she showed it

450
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:50,841
to a friend of hers who knows
someone at the school, and...

451
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:51,925
(<i> rumbling</i> )

452
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,525
A mast support gave way.

453
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:09,567
The starboard sprit
is fouling one of the mainsails.

454
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:10,568
Can we fix it?

455
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:11,987
I don't think so.

456
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,571
We're going to have
to jettison the sprit.

457
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:14,781
Let's fall off a little.

458
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,200
Take some pressure
off the sails.

459
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,868
Lock that down
and give me a hand.

460
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,671
One more turn.

461
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:34,968
Lock it!

462
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,262
Good work.

463
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:38,472
I'm going to
jettison the sprit.

464
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:50,317
That's better,

465
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:54,530
but we're still getting
a lot of spill off the sails.

466
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:59,243
We won't be able to make
much headway with each tack.

467
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:01,161
I don't think we'll be able

468
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,956
to get to the Denorios Belt
like this.

469
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,291
The ancient Bajorans

470
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:07,418
probably ran into
these kinds of problems.

471
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:09,587
I suppose they did.

472
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:12,298
Well, did they give up
and go home?

473
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:16,843
It seems to me, we're here
to prove that they didn't.

474
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,762
What are we waiting for?

475
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:21,807
Let's get to work.

476
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,517
Lay out the port sprit.

477
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:30,941

You know what
we should do?

00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,163
What?

492
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:30,083
We should go to Quark's
and sing it for everybody.

00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:33,253
Oh, no. I-I-I think
we should switch to synthale.

No, no, this isn't...

00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,134
a synthale kind of night.

00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:48,018
She walked right
past me, Chief.

Acted like I
wasn't even there.

499
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,608
Do you know what I think?

500
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:56,026
What?

501
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:58,945
I think she's
in love with you.

502
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,865
I don't think so.

503
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:04,326
It's the only explanation.

504
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,371
Unless...

00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:14,044
Unless she really
ignored you

508
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:16,589
because she can't
stand you.

(<i> laughs</i> )

510
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:22,177
Isn't there some
explanation in between?

511
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,929
Well...

512
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:28,350
you're not
an in-between kind of guy.

513
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,143
What do you mean?

514
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:33,230
Well, people either
love you or hate you.

515
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,191
Really?

516
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:41,405
I mean, I hated you
when we first met.

517
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:44,199
I remember.

518
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,659
But now...

519
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,830
And now?

520
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:56,836
Well... now I don't.

521
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,633
(<i> sighs</i> )

522
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:01,883
That means a lot to me, Chief.

523
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,343
It really does.

524
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,344
Really!

525
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,388
Now...

526
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:09,725
that is from
the heart, huh?

527
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:12,185
Huh? I really<i> do.</i>

528
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:16,565
Not hate you
anymore.

529
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:21,069
Hey, do you know
what I think?

530
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,237
What?

531
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:29,244
If you want to know
why she ignored you,

532
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:32,247
you have got
to confront her.

533
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,749
You're right.

534
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:38,170
I got to go
right up to her...

535
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:43,008
and ask her flat out

536
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:48,347
where she gets off
walking past me like that.

537
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:50,432
Better wait until tomorrow.

538
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:51,475
Why?

539
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:54,060
Why not right now?

540
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:58,940
Because you can barely
stand up right now.

541
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,319
Good point.

542
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:04,363

00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:06,281

Coming about.

550
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,312
Now.

551
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,277
Good.

552
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,529
Solid job.

553
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:47,155
Let's take a break.

554
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,199
String up the hammock.

555
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:52,703
Hammock time.

556
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:53,953
Yo!

557
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,961
Hop in.

558
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,171
Phew!

559
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,548
Oh!

560
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:06,550
Nice.

561
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,093
Whoa!

562
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:09,094
I'm okay.

563
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:10,512
Comfortable,
isn't it?

564
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:11,805
I'm fine. Yeah.

565
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:13,724
Yeah, we'll make
a sailor of you yet.

566
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:15,642
I suppose
congratulations
are in order.

567
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,227
Pennington is
a good school--

568
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:18,562
and very competitive.

569
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:20,439
Dad, before you say anything,

570
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:22,357
I'm turning down the fellowship.

571
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,776
Turning it down?
Why?

572
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:25,444
I'm just... not ready to go.

573
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:27,153
Jake, an opportunity
like this

574
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,531
doesn't come
along every day.

575
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:31,450
I can defer admission
for a year.

576
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,326
If I want to go then,
I still can.

577
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,745
Well, that's fine,

578
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:36,496
but why will things be
different in a year?

579
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,748
I don't know.

580
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:39,291
They just might be, that's all.

581
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,045
Now, remember, Jake.

582
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:47,507
I wasn't much older than you
when I left for San Francisco

583
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,092
to go to Starfleet Academy.

584
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,677
For the first
few days,

585
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,137
I was so homesick,

586
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:54,807
that I'd go back
to my house in New Orleans

587
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:58,059
every night for dinner.

588
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,853
I'd materialize
in my living room

589
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:03,064
at 6:30 every night

590
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:07,486
and take my seat at the table,
just like I had come downstairs.

591
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:09,070
You must have used up

592
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,824
a month's worth
of transporter credits.

593
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:13,325
Hmm.

594
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:16,328
My parents, they never said
anything about it.

595
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:20,791
Just "How you doing, son?
How was school today?"

596
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:24,628
They knew that I would get over
being homesick soon enough.

597
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:27,965
Well, after about the
fifth, sixth day,

598
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:30,258
you couldn't pry me
from that campus.

599
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,719
Of course now, if you go
to Pennington,

600
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,596
you won't be able to beam
back to the station

601
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:38,057
to have dinner
with your old man.

602
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:41,478
After about a week or so,
you'll get over it.

603
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:49,778
It's not me
I'm worried about.

604
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,280
It's you.

605
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,782
Me?

606
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:55,283
Well, if I go,
you'll be all alone.

607
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:58,161
Well, I appreciate
you thinking about me, Jake,

608
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:01,289
but please don't turn down
this opportunity on my account.

609
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,249
I'll have plenty of people
to keep me company.

610
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:06,503
I can always eat dinner
with Dax or Dr. Bashir

611
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:10,883
or... even Quark.

612
00:34:10,883 --> 00:34:12,300
I guess.

613
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,053
I'd feel a lot better
if you had someone.

614
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:18,807
You know, someone special,
like a girlfriend.

615
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:19,766
I see.

616
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:21,810
Well, let's
face it.

617
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,437
It's been over a year
since your last date.

618
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:25,522
A<i> year,</i> Dad.

619
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:30,027
Well, you got to make time
for these things.

620
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:32,863
I cannot believe
that I'm getting advice

621
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:35,032
about women from my son.

622
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,744
Don't think of me
as your son right now.

623
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:41,329
Just think of me as another guy.

624
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,664
(<i> laughs</i> )

625
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:44,041
Another guy who happens to know

626
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:46,418
a very attractive lady
who wants to meet you.

627
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,211
(<i> chuckles</i> )

628
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:51,798
You are trying to set me up?

629
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:53,884
Why not?

630
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:54,885
(<i> both laughing</i> )

631
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:55,886
(<i> crashing</i> )

632
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:57,262
What was that?

633
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:00,724
I'm not sure,
but whatever hit us

634
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:02,517
almost tore off
the port mainsail.

635
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,927
Main power is off-line.

636
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:38,344
We're moving at warp.

637
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:39,345
How can that be?

638
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:40,889
I don't know.

639
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,269
What happened?

640
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:50,315
That's a good question.

641
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,448
There's no record

642
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:00,826
of any spatial anomalies
in this region.

643
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:01,785
What are these?

644
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:02,995
Tachyon eddies.

645
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:04,704
They run all
through this area.

646
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,581
Could we have gotten
caught up in one?

647
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:09,042
No, tachyons don't
have enough mass

648
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:11,419
to affect a ship of...

649
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,592
This...<i> isn't</i>

650
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:20,261
an ordinary ship.

651
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:23,015
It has a lot more
surface area

652
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:24,099
relative to
its mass.

653
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:25,517
Because of the sails.

654
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:28,645
And since tachyons
travel faster than light,

655
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:31,523
it could be that their impact
on the sails

656
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:35,318
somehow accelerated us
to warp speeds.

657
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:40,323
We could be light-years
off course.

658
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:44,077
The question is...
where did we end up?

659
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:46,163
You check the rigging.

660
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:48,832
I'll try to
figure that out.

661
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,754
We lost the jib
and port mainsail.

662
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:00,052
Damn!

663
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:01,845
What?

664
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,263
It's useless.

665
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:06,307
Now we can't figure out
where we are

666
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,767
or where we're going.

667
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:10,269
Guess we'll have to contact
the station.

668
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:13,231
Let them know they have
to come and get us.

669
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:17,443
We were so close.

670
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:19,071
Another day and we
would have made it

671
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:21,364
to the Denorios Belt.

672
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:25,493
Hey, we did pretty well
getting as far as we did.

673
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,914
Is something wrong?

674
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:31,166
The station's
not responding.

675
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:33,126
Is the com unit
damaged?

676
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:36,379
Not as far as I can see.

677
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,423
Maybe they haven't
received our message yet.

678
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:41,259
Do you think we could have
been carried that far away

679
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,011
from the
station?

680
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:44,345
I suppose it's possible.

681
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:49,184
Well... they'll
find us eventually.

682
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,769
Right?

683
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:54,397
Sure.

684
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,223
Excuse me.

685
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:29,266
Yes?

686
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:32,727
We were at medical
school together.

687
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,522
Julian Bashir.

688
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:39,692
<i>You're</i> Bashir?

689
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,402
You sound surprised.

690
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:44,614
Well, I thought
you were Andorian.

691
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:45,991
Andorian?

692
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:47,993
Someone
pointed out

693
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:49,953
an Andorian to me at a party

694
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:52,413
and said
that<i> that</i> was Julian Bashir.

695
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,207
It was, um, New Year's Eve

696
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:56,584
at Bruce Lucier's
four years ago.

697
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,129
Well, I did go to that party.
May I?

698
00:38:59,129 --> 00:39:01,256
Yes.

699
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:03,175
With my friend, Erib.

700
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:04,550
Now,<i> he's</i> Andorian.

701
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,927
No, thank you.

702
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,762
I must have gotten
you mixed up.

703
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:11,141
All these years, I thought
you were someone else.

704
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:13,935
Didn't you see me give
my speech at graduation?

705
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:16,855
No, I was back stage,
waiting to give<i> my</i> speech.

706
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:20,233
I was so nervous,
I almost passed out.

707
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:23,195
I know the feeling.

708
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:25,989
So, you gave me
quite a run for my money.

709
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:29,242
If it hadn't been
for that preganglionic fiber...

710
00:39:29,242 --> 00:39:31,286
You know about that.

711
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:33,621
I know that if you
hadn't got that wrong,

712
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,707
<i>you</i> would be valedictorian.

713
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:38,668
Well, I never got a chance
to congratulate you.

714
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:41,880
It seems like
a long time ago, doesn't it?

715
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,548
Not so long.

716
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:46,718
So, you got the<i> Lexington.</i>

717
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:48,345
You must have had
quite an adventure

718
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:51,681
exploring uncharted space

719
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:52,765
meeting fascinating
new species

720
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:55,227
with fascinating
new diseases.

721
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:58,980
Actually, it ended up being
more of a charting expedition.

722
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:02,275
Sometimes it would be months
between planetary systems.

723
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:04,652
You wouldn't believe
how excited I would get

724
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,779
if we actually found
something living,

725
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,699
even if it was just moss
under a rock.

726
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:18,457
Don't take this the wrong way,
but... there were times

727
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:21,169
when I regretted
not taking your assignment.

728
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:22,962
Really?

729
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:25,423
I read your paper on the
immunotherapy project

730
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,800
you've been doing on Bajor.

731
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,510
It was brilliant.

732
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,970
Thank you.

733
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,471
I really
envy

734
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:33,890
the opportunity you have

735
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:36,309
to work on that kind
of long-term project.

736
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:37,352
On the<i> Lexington,</i>

737
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:39,312
it was collect
your samples

738
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:40,355
and then on to
the next system.

739
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:42,399
I suppose I was lucky...

740
00:40:42,399 --> 00:40:44,150
What's happening
on Bajor?

741
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:47,153
Were you able to get the T cell
anomalies under control?

742
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,447
If you're
really that interested,

743
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,449
we should go to the Infirmary,

744
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,993
and I can show you
my latest results.

745
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,787
I'd love it.

746
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:04,712
Morn, about that bet.

747
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:07,506
I believe the odds
were three to one.

748
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,149
So, Dad...

749
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:26,109
we're not going
to run out of air

750
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:27,402
or anything, are we?

751
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:28,736
Don't worry.

752
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,905
Somebody will find us
before that happens.

753
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,240
Hmm.

754
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:35,701
So...

755
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:38,371
tell me about this woman
you want me to meet.

756
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:40,123
Well...

757
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:42,041
she's a freighter Captain.

758
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,501
(<i> whistles</i> )

759
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,628
A freighter Captain.

760
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:46,587
Well, Dad, trust me.

761
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:47,922
You'll like her.

762
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:50,258
All right.

763
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:52,385
I'll agree to meet her,
on one condition.

764
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:53,928
What?

765
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:56,014
That you agree not
to base your decision

766
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:59,142
about going to Pennington
on how our date turns out.

767
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:00,143
Don't worry.

768
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:01,644
I won't.

769
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:04,522
I've already decided
to wait at least a year.

770
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,482
Why?

771
00:42:05,482 --> 00:42:07,025
Well...

772
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:13,239
I've heard
that you can only write

773
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,367
about what you've experienced.

774
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:17,660
And you-you got to admit,

775
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:21,039
Deep Space 9 is a pretty
good place to get experience.

776
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,216
Dad.

777
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,098
It appears we've
got company.

778
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:42,185
What do you think
they want?

779
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:43,478
(<i> com beeping</i> )

780
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:46,439
Hmm. Looks like we're
about to find out.

781
00:42:50,402 --> 00:42:52,653
SISKO:
What can I do
for you, Dukat?

782
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:56,241
Well, I wanted to be the
first one to congratulate you.

783
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:59,077
Congratulate me?

784
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:03,039
On managing to make it
all the way here.

785
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,082
All the way where?

786
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:05,500
Don't you know?

787
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:09,254
You've just entered
the Cardassian system.

788
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,467
The tachyon eddy.

789
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:17,429
It must have taken us
past the Denorios Belt

790
00:43:17,429 --> 00:43:18,471
and brought us here.

791
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:20,557
The same thing
must have happened

792
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:22,141
to the ancient Bajorans.

793
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,309
We did it!

794
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:25,437
We proved the trip
was possible.

795
00:43:25,437 --> 00:43:28,981
DUKAT: I hate to interrupt
your celebration, Commander,

796
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,608
but I've been asked

797
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:34,446
to convey a message
from the Cardassian government.

798
00:43:34,446 --> 00:43:36,697
"Your voyage is a testament

799
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,950

"that your arrival coincides
