00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:22,189
(<i> grunting</i> )

2
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,167
<i>E-cha.</i>

3
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,502
<i>Movek.</i>

4
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:46,839
Okay...

5
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:49,048
I see your point.

6
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:52,219
The<i> mek'leth</i> 
definitely has its advantages,

7
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:54,847
but I still think
the<i> bat'leth,</i> 
with its longer reach,

8
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:56,932
is usually
the deciding factor.

9
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:58,726
That is a classic argument.

10
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:01,353
However, I find using a large
and intimidating weapon

11
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:04,815
like the<i> bat'leth</i> 
often leads to overconfidence.

12
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:07,902
So you think
that I was overconfident.

13
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:10,654
You<i> were</i> overconfident.

14
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:13,741
You thought by distracting me
with your outfit,

15
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,367
you would gain an advantage.

16
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:16,535
My outfit.

17
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:18,370
Um...

18
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,205
I thought that...

19
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,249
I mean, I only assumed that...

20
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:25,002
You thought that I
wore this for you.

21
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:27,755
Talk about
overconfidence.

22
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,266
Worf...

23
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:40,726
<i>E-cha.</i>

24
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:44,897
<i>Movek.</i>

25
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:47,775
But in my own defense,

26
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:50,569
you do try your own
tactics of distraction

27
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:53,781
with all that shouting
and growling you do.

28
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:55,365
I'm only vocalizing my...

29
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,618
Odo to Worf.

30
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,286
Worf here.

31
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,538
Please report
to Airlock 5, Commander.

32
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,457
There's an intoxicated
Klingon here

33
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,166
who's demanding to see you.

34
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,501
I'm on my way.

35
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:09,630
Computer, exit.

36
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:15,677
Stay back!

37
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,013
You miserable<i> koruts!</i>

38
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:22,101
Easy!
None of us<i> koruts</i> 
is going to hurt you.

39
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:23,435
Kurn!

40
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,312
Worf.

41
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,106
I knew you'd come.

42
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:29,817
He is my brother.

43
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:33,528
The sons of Mogh reunited
for one last time.

44
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,196
Where have you been?

45
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:37,282
I have tried to
contact you for months.

46
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,034
Well, I'm here now...

47
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:40,619
but not for long.

48
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:43,371
Soon there will be
only one son of Mogh.

49
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,916
I came for<i> Mauk-to'Vor.</i>

50
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,751
What?

51
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,544
Yes, Brother.

52
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,964
I want you to kill me.

53
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,092
(<i> snoring</i> )

54
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,515
(<i> grunting</i> )

55
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:08,850
(<i> yelling</i> )

56
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,435
Guard!

57
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,646
Something for my head!

58
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,148
Guard!

59
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:16,316
You are not in
the holding cell.

60
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,359
You're in my quarters.

61
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,990
For your head.

62
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,003
Soft...

63
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,587
comfortable...

64
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:40,174
just like the rest
of these quarters.

65
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:43,677
No one would ever suspect
a warrior lives here.

66
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,386
It serves me.

67
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:48,182
Always defending the Federation.

68
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:52,811
Tell me, Worf, does Starfleet
ever make mistakes,

69
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,688
even in their furniture?

70
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,982
Kurn, where have you been?

71
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:59,734
It has been four months
since your last message.

72
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:03,488
I've been overseeing the end
of a once-proud House.

73
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,948
Perhaps you've heard of it.

74
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,075
It was called
the House of Mogh.

75
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,077
I know what has happened.

76
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,167
I regret that,
by opposing Gowron,

77
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,794
I have brought disgrace
to our family.

78
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,838
You regret?

79
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,840
What's next, Worf?

80
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,842
Do you want to apologize to me?

81
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,593
Express your sympathy?

82
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,222
How many human weaknesses
will you display?

83
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:30,932
I do not apologize
for what I have done.

84
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,601
I could not join Gowron
in his war with Cardassia

85
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,896
or the Federation.
It would've been dishonorable.

86
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,523
Oh, so, in avoiding dishonor
for yourself,

87
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:41,235
you've brought it down
on the rest of your family.

88
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:44,321
What a noble act.
How selfless.

89
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,698
I will not debate this
with you, Kurn.

90
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:48,742
What is done is done.

91
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,618
For you, it's done--

92
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:53,830
you and your comfortable
Federation life,

93
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,208
your glorious Starfleet career--

94
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,543
but not for me.

95
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:06,634
Our family had a seat
on the High Council.

96
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,970
We were feared
by our enemies,

97
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,890
respected
by our friends.

98
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,309
It was even said
that if Gowron died,

99
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:19,273
the leadership of the Council
might be passed to someone
from the House of Mogh.

100
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:23,944
Then you chose to side
with the Federation

101
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,321
against the Empire.

102
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:29,699
Gowron took our ships,
our land,

103
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,036
our seat on the Council,
everything.

104
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,292
Kurn, I know
this has been difficult for you.

105
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:43,922
What do you know?
Did you watch as Gowron's men
seized our land

106
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:46,800
and stripped our family
of its name?

107
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,552
Did you have to endure
the humiliation

108
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,306
of being ejected
from the High Council

109
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,933
in front of
the Emperor himself?

110
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:57,518
No. You chose to stay here,

111
00:07:57,518 --> 00:08:01,606
safe, comfortable, secure.

112
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:07,321
You have everything you want,
and I have nothing,
not even my honor,

113
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:11,283
but you can
give that back to me.

114
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:13,743
By killing you?

115
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,663
I'm already dead
to our people,

116
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:20,125
and so are you,
but you don't care.

117
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:24,921
I have never asked you
for anything,

118
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,799
but you took away my honor,

119
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,884
and only you
can give it back.

120
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:35,640
So now I am asking you
for<i> Mauk-to'Vor.</i>

121
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:41,104
Is an honorable death
too much to ask from my brother?

122
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:49,321
O'BRIEN:
<i>Operations Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 49556.2.</i>

<i>of the Bajoran colonies</i>

requesting permission
to enter Bajoran space.

128
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,084
This is Bajoran control.

129
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,752
Please transmit
your identification code

130
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,087
and flight plan.

131
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,422
Acknowledged.

132
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,633
Major.

133
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,304
Major!

134
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:15,889
Yes? What?

135
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,265
Sorry, Major.

136
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,142
It's just
we're almost home.

137
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,895
Oh, thanks.

138
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,646
Almost home?

139
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,565
How long have
I been asleep?

140
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,234
Seven hours.

141
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,986
I don't get seven hours
sleep at the station.

142
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,405
Must be the company.

143
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:32,989
Bajoran Control to<i> Yukon.</i>

144
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,574
You are cleared
to enter the system

145
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,201
and proceed to Deep Space 9.

146
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,203
Thank you.
(<i> yawning</i> )

147
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:40,080
Oh, I am so hungry,

148
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,457
I could even eat
Quark's food.

149
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,334
Let's not get crazy.

150
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,836
If you really want
some good--

151
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,588
What was that?

152
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,465
Some kind
of high-energy discharge.

153
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,509
It was pretty close.

154
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,886
Only 5,000 kilometers
from here.

155
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:57,180
Just outside Bajoran space.

156
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,183
Elevated tachyon readings,
subspace shock waves.

157
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:02,394
Looks like
a cloaked ship exploded.

158
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:04,979
There's no debris.
No residual warp fields.

159
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,898
Well, something
exploded.

160
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,649
Let's take a closer look.

161
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,611
Bring us to 500 meters
from those coordinates.

162
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,331
Approaching the coordinates.

163
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,208
I'm not seeing any signs of...

164
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,709
Wait a minute.

165
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,920
I'm picking up
another tachyon surge.

166
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,423
A ship's de-cloaking
directly ahead of us.

167
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,763
KLINGON:
Federation vessel.

168
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,807
This is the Imperial
Klingon Ship<i> Korinar.</i>

169
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,643
We are engaged in military
exercises in this area.

170
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:47,021
You will alter course
and return to Bajoran space
immediately.

171
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,856
This is Major
Kira Nerys.

172
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,400
We're investigating an explosion

173
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,943
which happened
at these coordinates--

174
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,528
You have been given a warning

175
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,113
according
to interstellar agreements.

176
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:56,906
You will not receive another.

177
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,451
They've locked their
disruptors onto us, Major.

178
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,417
Take us home, Chief.

179
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,419
But keep scanning
the coordinates

180
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,004
of that explosion.

181
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,713
There's a lot more
going on out here

182
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:15,716
than just military exercises.

183
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,847
Quark, have you seen Worf?

184
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,932
He was supposed to meet me
in the holosuite
five minutes ago.

185
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,309
As if you're
never late.

186
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:26,019
Worf is never late.

187
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,354
In fact, he grumbles at me

188
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,356
if I'm two minutes
behind schedule.

189
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,941
Well, I haven't seen him
since this morning,

190
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,027
and if he can't
at least be civil,

191
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,820
I don't care to see
him in my bar again.

192
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,197
It's just his way.

193
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,615
It's nothing personal, Quark.

194
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,534
No. 

195
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:42,785
This was more than
his standard rudeness.

196
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,246
He came in here, ordered
some Klingon incense

197
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,332
and nearly threw me across
the bar when I tried

198
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,125
to give him some
replicated incense.

199
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,461
What kind of Klingon incense?

200
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,921
Something called
<i>adanji.</i>

201
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,134
What would he want
with<i> adanji?</i>

202
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:02,222
Why? Is there something
special about<i> adanji?</i>

203
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,101
That does it.

204
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,646
I'm going to stop talking
to the customers.

205
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:27,414
You have been wronged
in this life.

206
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:30,917
There is nothing left here
for you.

207
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,377
No honor...

208
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,589
no future.

209
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,887
Mmm...

210
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:47,850
I wish to reclaim my honor
in the next life.

211
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,729
I am ready to cross
the River of Blood

212
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:53,440
and enter<i> Sto-Vo-Kor.</i>

213
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:58,528
Commander.

214
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:01,780
Odo, yesterday you called
Worf to the airlock

215
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,116
to see some Klingon.

216
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,201
That's right.
Who was it?

217
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,703
His name is Kurn.

218
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,580
It turns out
he's Worf's brother.

219
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,123
Worf's brother.

220
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,790
Oh, my God.

221
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,960
Dax to Worf.

222
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,003
Computer, locate
Commander Worf.

223
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,880
Commander Worf
is in his quarters.

224
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,424
Is he alone?

225
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,175
Negative.
Captain Kurn is with him.

226
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,427
Come on.

227
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:35,356
May this blade speed you
on your journey.

228
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,451
Good-bye, my brother.

229
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:50,538
Good... bye.

230
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,335
(<i> grunting</i> )

231
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,919
(<i> yells</i> )

232
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:13,478
Dax to Ops.
Emergency transport.
Two to the Infirmary.

233
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,772
This is not your concern!
It is a private matter!

234
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,649
I doubt Captain Sisko
would agree.

235
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,985
You'd better hope
he lives, Commander.

236
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,613
If not, you'll be charged
with murder.

237
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,725
Kurn's going to make it.

238
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,852
Julian said he'll be up
on his feet by tomorrow morning.

239
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:56,855
Good. Mr. Worf,
I want you to tell me

240
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:59,691
why I shouldn't put you on
the next transport out of here.

241
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,735
You are well within
your right to do so.

242
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:04,821
I'm not talking
about my rights.
Answer my question.

243
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:09,033
Captain, I do not
have an answer.

244
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:13,037
Sir, I realize my actions
were in violation of
Starfleet regulations--

245
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:17,166
Regulations? We're not
talking about some obscure
technicality, Mr. Worf.

246
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,377
You tried to commit
premeditated murder.

247
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,838
Benjamin, it wasn't murder.

248
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,632
Worf and Kurn were performing
a<i> Mauk-to'Vor</i> ritual.

249
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,967
It's part of Klingon belief
that when--

250
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:30,764
At the moment, I don't give
a damn about Klingon beliefs,
rituals or custom!

251
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,557
Now, I have given you both
a lot of leeway

252
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,642
when it comes to following
Klingon traditions,

253
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,478
but in case you haven't noticed,
this is not a Klingon station,

254
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,647
and those are not Klingon
uniforms you're wearing.

255
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,524
There is a limit
to how far I'll go

256
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:44,402
to accommodate cultural
diversity among my officers,

257
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,279
and you've just reached it!

258
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,823
When your brother is released
from the Infirmary,

259
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:52,243
you better find another way
to settle your family problems.
Is that clear?!

260
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:53,661
Captain, it may not
be possible--

261
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,413
Uh, it's clear.

262
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,624
There are definitely
other possibilities for Kurn.

263
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,041
This will never happen again.

264
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,501
You're damned right it won't!

265
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,420
Now, both of you-- get out!

266
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,435
What do you make of it, Chief?

267
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:19,312
From these
magnetic flux readings,

268
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,481
the energy discharge we detected
could have been caused

269
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,650
by the destruction
of a cloaked target drone.

270
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,778
Which would support the
story about conducting
military maneuvers.

271
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:29,948
O'BRIEN: On the other hand,
this type of explosion
could also have been caused

272
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,991
by an accidental
warp nacelle inversion.

273
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,368
Or a blown plasma conduit
or a dozen other things.

274
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,789
The bottom line is there's
no way to be certain
from these readings.

275
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:42,502
The larger question is:
What are these Klingons up to?

276
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,170
Whatever it is,
they're doing it

277
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,130
awfully close
to Bajoran space.

278
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,882
And they're very touchy
about it.

279
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,592
One thing I've had enough of

280
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:52,219
is tiptoeing
around the Klingons.

281
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,889
Take the<i> Defiant</i>
and run a sensor sweep

282
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,724
of those coordinates.

283
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,768
And if I run
into the Klingons?

284
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:01,354
Tell them that the ship
is conducting military exercises

285
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,272
according
to interstellar agreements.

286
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,526
Understood.
Should I take Worf?

287
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,988
I don't want Worf anywhere near
other Klingons right now.

288
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:12,281
Keep him informed
of what's going on,

289
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:16,160
but under no circumstances
is he to accompany you.
Is that clear?

290
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,204
Yes, sir.

291
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,582
Sir...
Don't say it, Chief.

292
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,793
I've already got
one officer defending Worf.

293
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,461
I don't need two.

294
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:38,265
He's stabilized.
I can revive him
at any time.

295
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,394
Wake him.

296
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:48,026
I'll be just outside
if you need me.

297
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:02,582
I...

298
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:06,544
am... alive?

299
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,170
Yes.

300
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,423
Commander Dax realized
what we were doing

301
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:13,217
and she had you beamed
to the Infirmary.

302
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:20,767
I was looking forward
to being in<i> Sto-Vo-Kor.</i>

303
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,102
(<i> sighs</i> )

304
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,855
I was hoping
to see Father there.

305
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:28,816
He still awaits you,

306
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,694
but it is not yet time
for you to join him.

307
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:37,241
And I suppose
<i>you</i> will decide
when that time has come.

308
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:40,202
It is not for me
to make that choice.

309
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,871
Why not?

310
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:46,292
You chose not to complete
the<i> Mauk-to'Vor</i> ritual.

311
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,044
It was not my decision.

312
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,378
It was Dax and Odo
that prevented...

313
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,964
Did you
fight them?

314
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:53,215
Did you threaten
to kill them both

315
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,301
if they interfered?

316
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:58,888
And are you standing here now
with the<i> mevak</i> dagger,

317
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,598
ready to slit my throat

318
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:03,267
and bring me the death
I deserve?

319
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,438
No.

320
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:16,280
For a moment,
in your quarters,

321
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,198
during the ritual...

322
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:22,536
you<i> were</i> Klingon.

323
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:27,541
But your Federation life
has claimed you again,

324
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,878
and now
it is claiming me as well.

325
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,173
I have no life.

326
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,969
I have no death.

327
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:43,016
Whatever is to become of me

328
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:45,309
is up to you.

329
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,566
(<i> door chimes</i> )

330
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,610
Enter.

331
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,160
What can I do for you,
Commander?

332
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,244
I wanted to apologize.

333
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:06,622
I interfered
in a family matter,

334
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,374
and if I caused you
and your brother

335
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,584
any further dishonor,
I'm sorry.

336
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,879
You were following
your conscience.

337
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:14,839
That is an honorable motive.

338
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,424
Not from a Klingon
point of view.

339
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:20,094
You are not Klingon.

340
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:22,847
Is there anything
I can do to help?

341
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,184
No.

342
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:29,770
Okay.

343
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,271
Commander.

344
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:35,526
There is the question
of what to do next.

345
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:36,903
Right.

346
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:39,030
Do you have any ideas?

347
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,533
None.

348
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,703
Well, in the short term,
there's no reason

349
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:48,455
why your brother can't stay here
on the station.

350
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,796
If Kurn is to remain
on the station,

351
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:59,175
he will need
tasks to perform.

352
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:01,343
A job.

353
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,262
What about security?

354
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,556
It worked for one
Klingon officer I know.

355
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:08,517
Yes, but I doubt Kurn
would be interested

356
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,310
in joining Starfleet.

357
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:15,566
Well, there is another
security force on the station.

358
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:22,115
Well, your brother's had
an interesting career

359
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:24,951
with the Klingon Defense Forces,
Mr. Worf.

360
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:26,953
I have just one question:

361
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:31,207
Does he know how to use
the<i> stun</i> setting
on a disruptor?

362
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:34,168
Non-lethal skills are not
valued in the Empire.

363
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:36,378
They are among my deputies.

364
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:39,090
And if your brother is going
to be a member of my detachment,

365
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,842
he's going to have to make some
adjustments in his thinking.

366
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,303
He will.

367
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,430
You're certain
of that?

368
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,558
I would not be asking you
to consider him if I were not.

369
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,519
I can appreciate how difficult
it must be for you

370
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:55,773
to be asking for a favor,
especially from me.

371
00:21:57,524 --> 00:22:00,861
Very well.
Have Kurn report here
tomorrow morning.

372
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,197
I am indebted to you.

373
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:05,616
Yes, you are.

374
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,245
And, Mr. Worf?

375
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:14,875
You'll find I'm a man
who collects on his debts.

376
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:49,409
This container
is not on your manifest.

377
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,121
It must be a clerical error.

378
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:53,539
I apologize.

379
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,457
Open it.

380
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,587
This is a message
from Starfleet Command

381
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:03,757
requesting an update
on our defense systems.

382
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:07,427
I'd say your brother's
doing well, Commander.

383
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,638
He's been on the job
six hours,

384
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:12,933
he's only killed
four Boslics so far.

385
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,894
Hmm.

386
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:18,772
Kira's right.
You do need
a sense of humor.

387
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:20,691
He's quite good, actually.

388
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,985
A little stern, but he never
steps over the line.

389
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:25,612
I'm finding him to be
a pleasant surprise.

390
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:28,574
I am...
gratified to hear that.

391
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:31,285
I'm sure you are.

392
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:32,995
Well, thanks for
the report, Commander.

393
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,248
I'll give it my
immediate attention.

394
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,167
Brother.

395
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,502
Kurn.

396
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:46,384
I hate this uniform.
I understand.

397
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:48,844
The transition will probably
be difficult for some time.

398
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,554
No, that's not
what I mean.

399
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,806
I have accepted
the transition.

400
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:55,309
I am a Bajoran
security officer.

401
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:58,979
The uniform is simply
uncomfortable.

402
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,689
I see.

403
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,482
But I will
get used to it.

404
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:05,861
You need not concern
yourself with me, Brother.

405
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,114
I won't disgrace you.

406
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:11,117
I never doubted it.
Carry on.

407
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:28,175
The same thing, Major.
High concentrations
of tachyons,

408
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:31,595
subspace distortions
and magneton traces.

409
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,471
Some cloaked ships
definitely passed

410
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:35,182
through this area in
the last 24 hours.

411
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,143
They're getting close
to violating Bajoran space,

412
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:38,936
but they're never
crossing the line.

413
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:40,646
I've never known Klingons
to be this fastidious

414
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,106
when it comes to
respecting borders.

415
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:43,399
Especially when
they're cloaked.

416
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:44,733
Something's wrong here.

417
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:47,611
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

418
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,782
O'BRIEN:
That's a Vor'cha-class cruiser.

419
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:53,491
Stand by shields
and phasers.

420
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:55,369
They've been damaged.

421
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:57,079
There's a massive hull breach
in their port quarter.

422
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:59,539
Main power's failing.
Casualties?

423
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,459
It's hard to tell through
all this radiation.

424
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:03,710
Open a channel.
Channel open.

425
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,588
This is Major Kira Nerys
on the USS<i> Defiant</i>

426
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:09,925
to unidentified Klingon vessel.
Do you require assistance?

427
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:13,095
This is IKS<i> Drovana</i> 
to USS<i> Defiant.</i>

428
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:14,972
We do not require assistance
at this time.

429
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:16,182
Do not approach us.

430
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:18,851
Understood,<i> Drovana.</i>

431
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,560
<i>Defiant</i> out.

432
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:24,440
They're losing emergency power.

433
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,566
Why aren't the other
Klingon ships helping them?

434
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,944
Maybe they don't want to give
away their positions.

435
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:32,072
Maybe they're busy
doing something that
can't be interrupted.

436
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:36,035
Something that blew a hole
the size of a house

437
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:38,245
in a Vor'cha-class cruiser.

438
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,456
Incoming transmission.

439
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,458
<i>Drovana</i> to<i> Defiant.</i>

440
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:45,543
We need access
to your medical facilities.

441
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,382
Our medical facilities
are extremely limited.

442
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:53,052
If you wish, we can tow you
to Deep Space 9.

443
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,803
Stand by.

444
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:02,102
<i>Defiant,</i> your offer
is accepted.

445
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,736
Odo to Worf.
Worf here.

446
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,696
We need you in the Infirmary,
Commander.

447
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,448
Your brother's
been seriously injured.

448
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:16,242
On my way.

449
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,915
What happened?

450
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:24,708
Kurn found a container
of contraband

451
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,710
in the lower hold
of the Boslic ship.

452
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,295
When he confronted
their Captain,

453
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,588
the man pulled out
a disruptor pistol

454
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:33,133
and then Kurn
let himself get shot.

455
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,634
<i>Let</i> himself?

456
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,803
Kurn is a trained
Klingon warrior.

457
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,764
He could have disarmed
the Boslic

458
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:41,058
without breaking a sweat,
but he just stood there,

459
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:43,852
let the man pull out
his weapon, aim and fire.

460
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,397
The only thing that saved him
was the man was so frightened

461
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:47,940
his hand was shaking.

462
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:51,193
He'll be all right... again.
Good.

463
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:54,113
A man with a death wish is
a danger not only to himself,

464
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:56,115
but to the rest
of his team.

465
00:26:56,115 --> 00:27:00,077
Kurn's days
as a security officer are over.

466
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:01,661
Would you like
to see him?

467
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:02,913
Yes.

468
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,001
Thank you, Doctor.

469
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,220
How do you feel?

470
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:21,307
Like a man who is
tired of waking up

471
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:24,226
and seeing
a human doctor's face.

472
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:26,353
I thought we had agreed
that you would try to make...

473
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:27,896
Worf...

474
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,607
I don't want
to talk anymore.

475
00:27:29,607 --> 00:27:32,276
It's not Klingon.

476
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:34,361
You're the elder brother.

477
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,905
You tell me what to do
and I'll do it.

478
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:40,493
My life is in your hands.

479
00:27:54,632 --> 00:27:56,716
BASHIR:
Well, so far,
there's nothing unusual

480
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,469
about any
of their casualties.

481
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:00,971
I've treated 15 cases of
severe radiation burns,

482
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:03,974
seven thoracic perforation
traumas caused by shrapnel,

483
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:06,726
and 23
decompression-related injuries.

484
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:09,480
All just what you'd expect
following an explosion
on a starship.

485
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,898
SISKO:
Do you have any idea
what caused the explosion?

486
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:14,943
Well, the radiation burns
were the result of exposure
to gamma rays.

487
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:18,656
My guess is they were hit
by a photon torpedo.
A torpedo?

488
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:20,949
From the fracture
pattern of the damage,

489
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,952
I'd say something exploded
about ten kilometers

490
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,496
off their port quarter.

491
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:27,789
But torpedoes
leave ion trails,

492
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,083
and the<i> Defiant</i> 
didn't pick up any
in the vicinity.

493
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,751
And the<i> Drovana</i> 
was cloaked.

494
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:33,837
Even Klingon torpedoes
can't track vessels

495
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,548
operating under cloak.

496
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:38,091
WORF:
Mines.

497
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,968
They hit a mine.

498
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,971
That's why there
weren't any ion trails.

499
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,848
And cloaked mines
can't be detected

500
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,517
by any known sensor array.

501
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:48,352
But there have been
at least a dozen ships

502
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:50,312
moving in and out of that system
since the explosion.

503
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:52,147
Why haven't they
struck any mines?

504
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,358
Well, the type of mine
currently used by the Klingons

505
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:56,276
remains dormant
until it is armed

506
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,153
by a coded
subspace signal.

507
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,322
So, the mine that
damaged the<i> Drovana</i>

508
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:03,075
must have malfunctioned
or been set off prematurely.

509
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,619
If we're right, there could be
thousands of mines

510
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:08,455
out there right now, and we'd
have no way of knowing it.

511
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:10,624
Mining a star system
is an act of war.

512
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:12,501
I didn't think the Klingons
were ready for that.

513
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:14,420
At the moment,
we can't even prove

514
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:17,756
these mines exist,
but if war comes,

515
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,551
the Klingons would be able
to cut off Deep Space 9

516
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:22,344
and the entire
Bajoran system.

517
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:24,096
How do we find
these mines?

518
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,889
Unless we know
their coordinates,

519
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,933
there's no way to find them
until we run into one.

520
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,893
Then we better get
those coordinates.

521
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:32,229
The place to
get them is docked at
Upper Pylon 3 right now.

522
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:34,814
The only question is how.

523
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:38,277
I have an idea.

524
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,987
You want me to turn
against my own people?

525
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,698
Will my dishonor never end?

526
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:45,618
It is their actions
that are dishonorable.

527
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:49,413
Secretly mining star systems
is not the act of warriors.

528
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:52,040
They behave like...
like Romulan cowards.

529
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,669
Is that how you
rationalize this--

530
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:58,880
by calling your people cowards
so you can be a hero?

531
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,676
Kurn, let me ask you this.

532
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:04,511
Do you agree
with what has happened

533
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,722
between the Empire
and the Federation?

534
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:08,599
It is not my place
to criticize--

535
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,267
Answer the question!

536
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:13,937
No. I opposed the decision
to break the treaty

537
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,981
but I was overruled
in Council.

538
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:18,150
Why did you oppose the decision?

539
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,528
Because Gowron
underestimates the Federation.

540
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:25,449
He thinks they're soft, weak,
but he is wrong.

541
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:27,660
Sooner or later,
there will be war.

542
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:30,162
A war the Empire may lose.

543
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,164
Yes.

544
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:35,417
You know that
mining this system
is just the beginning.

545
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:38,337
If we do nothing,
it will only encourage Gowron

546
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:41,214
to continue thinking
of the Federation as weak.

547
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:44,134
Eventually, he will attack,
and that<i> will</i> be

548
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:45,511
the end of the Empire.

549
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:47,887
That is why you must join me
on this mission.

550
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:50,390
Not for my honor,
and not for the Federation,

551
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,892
but to prevent the Empire
from being destroyed

552
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:54,770
in a war they cannot win.

553
00:30:57,439 --> 00:31:00,942
Our people have turned
their backs on us,

554
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:04,070
but we have not turned
our backs on them.

555
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:08,116
Let it be the sons
of Mogh, side by side,

556
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,243
saving our people.

557
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:13,872
Do this with me.

558
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:23,716
There. Very ugly.

559
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,303
Well, uglier, that is.

560
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,639
Joke.
I got it.

561
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:35,644
Well, this will
temporarily alter
your DNA signature

562
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:37,646
to match one of
our friends over there.

563
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,690
Should be good enough
to pass a cursory test.

564
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:42,776
How long will it last?
About four hours.

565
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:45,571
That should be
sufficient.

566
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:47,072
Kurn.

567
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,701
Kurn?

568
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,620
Yes, Doctor?

569
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,248
Please take a seat.

570
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:32,576
The deployment
plan for the mines

571
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:34,327
should be in the
defense system database.

572
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:36,413
I have found
the main file directory.

573
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:38,707
No, no. Ignore it.
It's a security
procedure

574
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:40,709
the High Council
instituted
three months ago.

575
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:43,295
False directories,
files,

576
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:44,755
entire databases
of disinformation

577
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:47,132
designed for spies
to steal.

578
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,593
Here's the real database.

579
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,511
Can you access
the deployment plan?

580
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,889
My security codes
have been changed

581
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:55,348
but not all of them.

582
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:58,017
Yes.

583
00:32:58,017 --> 00:33:00,145
(<i> door opens</i> )

584
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,816
You two...
what are you doing?

585
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:14,534
We're running a diagnostic
of the computer core.

586
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:18,330
There have been power
fluctuations in the
navigational control system.

587
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,624
I've not been informed
of any computer problems.

588
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:23,919
Perhaps you have
not been tending
to your duties.

589
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,755
I do not know you.
What is your name?

590
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:29,967
I am Commander Sorval

591
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:31,593
son of M'tokra.

592
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:33,762
How long have you been
aboard, Commander?

593
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:35,764
I will not be questioned
by a Lieutenant

594
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:37,683
who should be cleaning
my quarters.

595
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:40,352
Leave us, or I shall
have you stripped of rank

596
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,688
and sent home
in a transport.

597
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:46,859
My words were
ill-chosen, Commander.

598
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:49,528
Perhaps I can help you
with your investigation.

599
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:51,905
That will not be necessary.
All we require...

600
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:00,497
You did not have to do that.

601
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:02,081
He was backing down.

602
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:11,383
He was going to kill you.

603
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,721
We must hurry.

604
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:19,224
The disruptor blast will
alert the security sensors.

605
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:23,395
He was a warrior,
doing his duty,
defending the Empire

606
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:25,146
and I killed him.

607
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:28,441
My dishonor is complete.

608
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:35,448
Since we now have the detonation
codes for each mine,

609
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:38,785
we can set them off individually
or all at once.

610
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,245
Thank you,
Commander. Major?

611
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:41,580
We'll take care of it.

612
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,915
Congratulations,
Mr. Worf.

613
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:44,457
You did an
excellent job.

614
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:45,834
That goes for
your brother, too.

615
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:48,169
Thank you, sir.

616
00:34:55,052 --> 00:34:57,178
You don't seem very pleased.

617
00:34:57,178 --> 00:35:01,307
I am still troubled by the death
of that Klingon officer.

618
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,685
Your report said
it was self-defense.

619
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:05,353
That is not the point.

620
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,689
I should have seen
what he was going to do.

621
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:10,108
What do you mean?
From the way
you described it,

622
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,777
he was standing so close to you

623
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:13,737
you couldn't have seen
the knife in his hand.

624
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:15,405
He decided to kill me

625
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:17,198
while I was looking him
right in the eyes,

626
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:18,909
and I never saw it.

627
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:22,454
But Kurn did,
and he was three meters away.

628
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,083
Worf, I don't think
you can tell

629
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:28,418
someone's going to kill you
by looking at them.

630
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:32,338
A Klingon can.
It is an instinct.

631
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,633
The ability
to look someone in the eyes

632
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:37,594
and see the decision to kill.

633
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:40,055
An instinct I no longer have.

634
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:43,892
Kurn was right.

635
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:45,602
I have lived
with humans so long,

636
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:47,395
I no longer think
like a Klingon.

637
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:50,189
For a long time,
I have tried

638
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:52,943
to walk the line between
the Empire and the Federation.

639
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:55,487
I told myself
I could live in either world,

640
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,614
that it was my choice.

641
00:35:57,614 --> 00:36:02,160
But the truth is,
I cannot go back to the Empire.

642
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,287
Do you want to go back?

643
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,961
I had always hoped

644
00:36:10,961 --> 00:36:15,548
that one day the House of Mogh
would reclaim its rightful place

645
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,134
and that I would return.

646
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:22,139
But now I know
that even if I did,

647
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:24,724
I have no place there.

648
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,980
This is all I have.

649
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,774
Is that enough?

650
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:39,072
It will have to be.

651
00:36:41,992 --> 00:36:45,244
But my brother
does not even have this.

652
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:48,373
For him, there is no future
without the Empire--

653
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:49,541
no life.

654
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:52,711
It sounds like you're thinking

655
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,838
of carrying out the
<i>Mauk-to'Vor</i> ritual again.

656
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,508
No. I was able
to do it once

657
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:02,512
by telling myself it was
an honorable Klingon ritual,

658
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:05,932
but now I cannot help
but think of it as humans do...

659
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,020
as murder.

660
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:18,486
What if there was a way
for you to kill your brother...

661
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:21,073
without killing him?

662
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,083
We're ready, Major.

663
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,335
Open a channel.

664
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,171
This is the USS<i> Defiant</i>

665
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:38,548
to all Klingon vessels
near the Bajoran system.

666
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:40,926
We are preparing
to destroy your minefield.

667
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:44,930
I suggest you leave immediately.
This is your only warning.

668
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,395
Anything?

669
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,940
Nothing. If they're out there,
they're keeping quiet.

670
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,816
Well, they're out
there all right,

671
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:59,652
and I think we'll
be seeing them fairly soon.

672
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:03,406
Prepare to detonate the mine
in grid 21 alpha.

673
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:07,119
Ready, sir.

674
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,037
Send out the code.

675
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,421
Still nothing, Major.

676
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:21,549
Well, we can't say
we didn't warn them.

677
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:24,803
Detonate all the mines
in grids 22 alpha

678
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:27,180
through 47 gamma.

679
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,473
Aye, sir.

680
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,776
Just like flushing quail.

681
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:41,945
They're setting course...

682
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:44,697
327 mark 215.

683
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,658
Back to the Klingon Empire.

684
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:49,953
Let's see
how many other birds
we can flush out of here.

685
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,807
Why is it that suicide

686
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:15,061
is considered
a dishonorable death, Worf?

687
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,396
Shouldn't a warrior
have the right

688
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:20,233
to decide
when his time has come?

689
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:24,112
If you die by
your own hand,

690
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:27,532
you will not travel
across the River of Blood

691
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:29,659
and enter<i> Sto-Vo-Kor.</i>

692
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:32,912
Even if I got cast down
into the Underworld,

693
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:35,707
at least I'd be
with other Klingons,

694
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:39,544
even though they are
the dishonored dead.

695
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:42,130
Put down the disruptor.

696
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:52,015
Do you know what
my one regret is, Worf?

697
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:55,310
That we weren't raised together.

698
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:59,772
In the Empire, on Earth--
it wouldn't have mattered

699
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:03,943
but the sons of Mogh should
have never been separated.

700
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,820
On that...

701
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,198
we both agree.

702
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:10,742
But that is
the past,

703
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:15,247
and a warrior
should look to the future.

704
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:18,541
And in the future,

705
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:22,837
you should not be
burdened by my dishonor.

706
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,631
You are not a burden.

707
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:28,551
I have never
understood you, Worf.

708
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:33,056
But I do know this.

709
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:34,974
In your own way...

710
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:41,022
you are an honorable man.

711
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:51,741
And you will be
an honorable man again...

712
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:56,746
but not as my brother.

713
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:58,957
How long will
the procedure take?

714
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:02,294
Well, wiping his memory
will be relatively simple--

715
00:41:02,294 --> 00:41:03,836
say, an hour--

716
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,588
but changing
his genetic coding,

717
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,465
combined with surgically
altering his features,

718
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,842
will take at least
another five hours.

719
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,552
What will he remember?

720
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,012
He'll know
he's a Klingon

721
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:15,181
and how to speak
the language

722
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,058
and virtually everything
he needs to know

723
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:18,893
in order to survive--
except who he is.

724
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:21,520
And that's the first
question he'll ask.

725
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,897
"Who am I?"

726
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,441
Do you have an answer?

727
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:31,406
There is a man
named Noggra,

728
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:34,409
a friend of our father's.

729
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:37,203
He will be arriving
in a few hours.

730
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:42,125
He has agreed
to provide Kurn

731
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:46,629
with a new identity
and a new family.

732
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:49,882
He will supply Kurn
with all the answers
he needs.

733
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:55,638
Are you absolutely
certain about this, Worf?

734
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:58,266
Once I've erased
his memory engrams,

735
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:01,394
it'll be almost impossible
to restore them.

736
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:03,271
He won't remember you

737
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:07,108
or anything about
his real life.

738
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,820
It is the only way.

739
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,113
You may begin.

740
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:19,454
Prep him for surgery.

741
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:31,674
Rodek.

742
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:35,720
Can you hear me?

743
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,139
Rodek!

744
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:44,812
(<i> groaning</i> )

745
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,272
Where..?

746
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,773
Where am I?

747
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:50,276
On a Federation space station.

748
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,153
Our shuttle was damaged.

749
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:55,865
You were hit
by a plasma discharge.

750
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:59,494
I don't remember being...

751
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:01,704
on a shuttle.

752
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:06,418
In fact, I don't
remember anything.

753
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:09,170
The plasma discharge
damaged your hippocampus.

754
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:12,298
You're suffering from
a severe form of amnesia.

755
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,551
I'm afraid you may never regain
all of your memory.

756
00:43:14,551 --> 00:43:17,720
Who am I?

757
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,931
NOGGRA:
Your name is Rodek.

758
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:22,183
You are my son.

759
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:25,019
You're part
of the House of Noggra,

760
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:27,772
a small but proud family.

761
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:29,566
So don't worry.

762
00:43:29,566 --> 00:43:33,486
I will teach you all
that you have forgotten

763
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:35,863
when we get home.

764
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:38,783
I understand, Father.

765
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:48,960
Who are you?

766
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,003
I am Worf.

767
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:53,423
Are you part
of my family?

768
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:59,053
I have no family.
