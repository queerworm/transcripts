1
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,467
<i>E- cha.</i>

2
00:00:42,502 --> 00:00:43,698
<i>Movek.</i>

3
00:00:45,777 --> 00:00:47,178
Okay...

4
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:48,946
I see your point.

5
00:00:48,985 --> 00:00:52,391
The <i>mek'leth</i>
definitely has its advantages

6
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:56,200
but I still think the <i>bat'leth,</i>
with its longer reach

7
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:57,936
is usually the deciding factor.

8
00:00:57,976 --> 00:00:59,536
That is a classic argument.

9
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:02,553
However, I find using
a large and intimidating weapon

10
00:01:02,587 --> 00:01:05,253
like the <i>bat'leth</i>
often leads to overconfidence.

11
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:08,163
So you think
that I was overconfident.

12
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:10,834
You were overconfident.

13
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:13,872
You thought by distracting me
with your outfit

14
00:01:13,917 --> 00:01:15,785
you would gain an advantage.

15
00:01:15,822 --> 00:01:17,018
My outfit.

16
00:01:17,058 --> 00:01:18,618
Um...

17
00:01:18,663 --> 00:01:20,155
I thought that...

18
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,194
I mean, I only assumed that...

19
00:01:22,238 --> 00:01:25,508
You thought
that I wore this for you.

20
00:01:25,547 --> 00:01:27,951
Talk about overconfidence.

21
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,806
Worf...

22
00:01:39,851 --> 00:01:42,882
<i>E- cha.</i>

23
00:01:42,925 --> 00:01:44,862
<i>Movek.</i>

24
00:01:44,898 --> 00:01:48,066
But in my own defense

25
00:01:48,106 --> 00:01:50,908
you do try your own tactics
of distraction

26
00:01:50,946 --> 00:01:53,852
with all that shouting
and growling you do.

27
00:01:53,887 --> 00:01:55,915
I'm only vocalizing my...

28
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:58,055
Odo to Worf.

29
00:01:58,098 --> 00:01:59,294
Worf here.

30
00:01:59,335 --> 00:02:01,705
Please report to Airlock 5,
Commander.

31
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,836
There's
an intoxicated Klingon here

32
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,544
who's demanding to see you.

33
00:02:05,585 --> 00:02:08,149
I'm on my way.

34
00:02:08,191 --> 00:02:09,957
Computer, exit.

35
00:02:14,407 --> 00:02:16,275
Stay back!

36
00:02:16,312 --> 00:02:18,511
You miserable <i>koruts!</i>

37
00:02:18,551 --> 00:02:19,713
Easy!

38
00:02:19,754 --> 00:02:22,728
None of us <i>koruts</i>
is going to hurt you.

39
00:02:22,762 --> 00:02:24,026
Kurn!

40
00:02:24,065 --> 00:02:25,660
Worf.

41
00:02:25,703 --> 00:02:27,697
I knew you'd come.

42
00:02:27,742 --> 00:02:30,044
He is my brother.

43
00:02:30,081 --> 00:02:34,320
The sons of Mogh reunited
for one last time.

44
00:02:34,359 --> 00:02:35,623
Where have you been?

45
00:02:35,663 --> 00:02:38,101
I have tried
to contact you for months.

46
00:02:38,136 --> 00:02:40,073
Well, I'm here now...

47
00:02:40,107 --> 00:02:41,303
but not for long.

48
00:02:41,344 --> 00:02:44,580
Soon there will be
only one son of Mogh.

49
00:02:44,619 --> 00:02:46,453
I came for <i>Mauk-to'Vor.</i>

50
00:02:46,557 --> 00:02:48,323
What?

51
00:02:48,362 --> 00:02:49,854
Yes, Brother.

52
00:02:49,899 --> 00:02:53,271
I want you to kill me.

53
00:05:07,576 --> 00:05:08,772
Guard!

54
00:05:08,813 --> 00:05:10,716
Something for my head!

55
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:12,449
Guard!

56
00:05:12,489 --> 00:05:14,585
You are not in the holding cell.

57
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:16,463
You're in my quarters.

58
00:05:19,608 --> 00:05:21,100
For your head.

59
00:05:32,641 --> 00:05:34,339
Soft...

60
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:35,678
comfortable...

61
00:05:35,716 --> 00:05:38,348
just like the rest
of these quarters.

62
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,957
No one would ever suspect
a warrior lives here.

63
00:05:41,999 --> 00:05:43,629
It serves me.

64
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:46,542
Always defending the Federation.

65
00:05:46,578 --> 00:05:50,715
Tell me, Worf, does Starfleet
ever make mistakes

66
00:05:50,755 --> 00:05:52,954
even in their furniture?

67
00:05:52,995 --> 00:05:54,898
Kurn, where have you been?

68
00:05:54,933 --> 00:05:58,101
It has been four months
since your last message.

69
00:05:58,141 --> 00:06:01,674
I've been overseeing the end
of a once-proud House.

70
00:06:01,784 --> 00:06:03,219
Perhaps you've heard of it.

71
00:06:03,254 --> 00:06:05,384
It was called
the House of Mogh.

72
00:06:05,427 --> 00:06:07,398
I know what has happened.

73
00:06:10,807 --> 00:06:13,245
I regret that by opposing Gowron

74
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,118
I have brought disgrace
to our family.

75
00:06:16,155 --> 00:06:18,126
You regret?

76
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,595
What's next, Worf?

77
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,068
Do you want to apologize to me?

78
00:06:22,103 --> 00:06:23,629
Express your sympathy?

79
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:26,671
How many human weaknesses
will you display?

80
00:06:26,716 --> 00:06:28,880
I do not apologize
for what I have done.

81
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:30,356
I could not join Gowron

82
00:06:30,392 --> 00:06:32,626
in his war with Cardassia
or the Federation.

83
00:06:32,664 --> 00:06:34,362
It would've been dishonorable.

84
00:06:34,402 --> 00:06:36,704
Oh, so in avoiding dishonor
for yourself

85
00:06:36,742 --> 00:06:39,648
you've brought it down
on the rest of your family.

86
00:06:39,682 --> 00:06:41,277
What a noble act.

87
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,289
How selfless.

88
00:06:42,323 --> 00:06:44,989
I will not debate this
with you, Kurn.

89
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,194
What is done is done.

90
00:06:47,236 --> 00:06:48,934
For you, it's done...

91
00:06:48,973 --> 00:06:52,072
you and your comfortable
Federation life

92
00:06:52,114 --> 00:06:54,586
your glorious Starfleet career...

93
00:06:54,621 --> 00:06:56,785
but not for me.

94
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:04,913
Our family had a seat
on the High Council.

95
00:07:04,948 --> 00:07:07,386
We were feared by our enemies

96
00:07:07,421 --> 00:07:09,791
respected by our friends.

97
00:07:09,828 --> 00:07:12,630
It was even said
that if Gowron died

98
00:07:12,668 --> 00:07:14,536
the leadership of the Council

99
00:07:14,573 --> 00:07:17,945
might be passed to someone
from the House of Mogh.

100
00:07:17,982 --> 00:07:22,221
Then you chose to side
with the Federation

101
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:24,697
against the Empire.

102
00:07:24,732 --> 00:07:28,002
Gowron took our ships,
our land

103
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:30,605
our seat on the Council,
everything.

104
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:36,822
Kurn, I know
this has been difficult for you.

105
00:07:36,864 --> 00:07:38,060
What do you know?

106
00:07:38,101 --> 00:07:42,374
Did you watch as Gowron's men
seized our land

107
00:07:42,412 --> 00:07:45,112
and stripped our family
of its name?

108
00:07:45,152 --> 00:07:48,058
Did you have to endure
the humiliation

109
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,827
of being ejected
from the High Council

110
00:07:50,867 --> 00:07:53,203
in front of the Emperor himself?

111
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,368
No.

112
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,005
You chose to stay here

113
00:07:56,047 --> 00:07:59,921
safe, comfortable, secure.

114
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,826
You have everything you want

115
00:08:01,862 --> 00:08:05,360
and I have nothing,
not even my honor

116
00:08:05,404 --> 00:08:09,677
but you can
give that back to me.

117
00:08:09,716 --> 00:08:12,348
By killing you?

118
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:15,022
I'm already dead to our people

119
00:08:15,063 --> 00:08:19,130
and so are you,
but you don't care.

120
00:08:19,173 --> 00:08:23,172
I have never asked you
for anything

121
00:08:23,218 --> 00:08:26,124
but you took away my honor

122
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:28,495
and only you can give it back.

123
00:08:28,531 --> 00:08:34,410
So now I am asking you
for <i>Mauk-to'Vor.</i>

124
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:39,518
Is an honorable death
too much to ask from my brother?

125
00:08:43,437 --> 00:08:47,174
Operations Log,
Stardate 49556.2.

126
00:08:47,213 --> 00:08:49,845
Major Kira and I
are returning to the station

127
00:08:49,886 --> 00:08:51,982
after completing
our inspection tour

128
00:08:52,026 --> 00:08:55,091
of the Bajoran colonies
along the Cardassian border.

129
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:57,230
This is the Federation
Runabout <i>Yukon</i>

130
00:08:57,272 --> 00:08:59,938
requesting permission
to enter Bajoran space.

131
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,449
This is Bajoran control.

132
00:09:01,484 --> 00:09:03,683
Please transmit
your identification code

133
00:09:03,723 --> 00:09:04,851
and flight plan.

134
00:09:04,892 --> 00:09:06,156
Acknowledged.

135
00:09:07,867 --> 00:09:08,961
Major.

136
00:09:11,743 --> 00:09:12,712
Major!

137
00:09:12,746 --> 00:09:14,181
Yes? What?

138
00:09:14,216 --> 00:09:15,776
Sorry, Major.

139
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:17,621
It's just we're almost home.

140
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:19,789
Oh, thanks.

141
00:09:19,831 --> 00:09:22,099
Almost home?

142
00:09:22,137 --> 00:09:24,131
How long have I been asleep?

143
00:09:24,176 --> 00:09:25,509
Seven hours.

144
00:09:25,546 --> 00:09:28,280
I don't get seven hours
sleep at the station.

145
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,018
Must be the company.

146
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,617
Bajoran Control to <i>Yukon.</i>

147
00:09:31,662 --> 00:09:33,599
You are cleared
to enter the system

148
00:09:33,633 --> 00:09:35,501
and proceed to Deep Space 9.

149
00:09:35,538 --> 00:09:36,529
Thank you.

150
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:38,874
Oh, I am so hungry

151
00:09:38,914 --> 00:09:40,908
I could even eat Quark's food.

152
00:09:40,953 --> 00:09:42,513
Let's not get crazy.

153
00:09:42,557 --> 00:09:44,893
If you really want some good...

154
00:09:44,929 --> 00:09:46,627
What was that?

155
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:49,071
Some kind
of high-energy discharge.

156
00:09:49,174 --> 00:09:51,304
It was pretty close.

157
00:09:51,347 --> 00:09:53,581
Only 5,000 kilometers
from here.

158
00:09:53,619 --> 00:09:55,453
Just outside Bajoran space.

159
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,692
Elevated tachyon readings,
subspace shock waves.

160
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:01,068
Looks like
a cloaked ship exploded.

161
00:10:01,105 --> 00:10:02,335
There's no debris.

162
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,039
No residual warp fields.

163
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,674
Well, something exploded.

164
00:10:05,717 --> 00:10:07,415
Let's take a closer look.

165
00:10:07,454 --> 00:10:11,191
Bring us to 500 meters
from those coordinates.

166
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:21,687
Approaching the coordinates.

167
00:10:21,725 --> 00:10:23,924
I'm not seeing any signs of...

168
00:10:23,965 --> 00:10:25,491
Wait a minute.

169
00:10:25,535 --> 00:10:27,803
I'm picking up
another tachyon surge.

170
00:10:27,841 --> 00:10:30,040
A ship's de-cloaking
directly ahead of us.

171
00:10:35,895 --> 00:10:37,330
Federation vessel.

172
00:10:37,366 --> 00:10:39,668
This is the
Imperial Klingon Ship <i>Korinar.</i>

173
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:42,439
We are engaged in military
exercises in this area.

174
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:43,641
You will alter course

175
00:10:43,682 --> 00:10:45,881
and return to Bajoran space
immediately.

176
00:10:45,921 --> 00:10:47,619
This is Major Kira Nerys.

177
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,186
We're investigating an explosion

178
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,928
which happened
at these coordinates...

179
00:10:50,968 --> 00:10:52,369
You have been given a warning

180
00:10:52,405 --> 00:10:54,137
according
to interstellar agreements.

181
00:10:54,176 --> 00:10:55,577
You will not receive another.

182
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,085
They've locked
their disruptors onto us, Major.

183
00:11:04,202 --> 00:11:05,671
Take us home, Chief.

184
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:08,110
But keep scanning
the coordinates

185
00:11:08,145 --> 00:11:09,478
of that explosion.

186
00:11:09,516 --> 00:11:12,114
There's a lot more
going on out here

187
00:11:12,156 --> 00:11:14,390
than just military exercises.

188
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:19,503
Quark, have you seen Worf?

189
00:11:19,542 --> 00:11:20,511
He was supposed to meet me

190
00:11:20,544 --> 00:11:21,672
in the holosuite
five minutes ago.

191
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,115
As if you're never late.

192
00:11:23,151 --> 00:11:24,746
Worf is never late.

193
00:11:24,789 --> 00:11:26,258
In fact, he grumbles at me

194
00:11:26,292 --> 00:11:28,263
if I'm two minutes
behind schedule.

195
00:11:28,298 --> 00:11:30,132
Well, I haven't seen him
since this morning

196
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,164
and if he can't
at least be civil

197
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,680
I don't care to see
him in my bar again.

198
00:11:34,715 --> 00:11:35,741
It's just his way.

199
00:11:35,784 --> 00:11:37,482
It's nothing personal, Quark.

200
00:11:37,522 --> 00:11:41,829
No. This was more
than his standard rudeness.

201
00:11:41,866 --> 00:11:43,962
He came in here, ordered
some Klingon incense

202
00:11:44,006 --> 00:11:46,308
and nearly threw me across
the bar, when I tried

203
00:11:46,344 --> 00:11:48,076
to give him
some replicated incense.

204
00:11:48,116 --> 00:11:49,551
What kind of Klingon incense?

205
00:11:50,857 --> 00:11:52,657
Something called <i>adanji.</i>

206
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:57,128
What would he want
with <i>adanji?</i>

207
00:11:57,173 --> 00:12:00,941
Why? Is there something
special about <i>adanji?</i>

208
00:12:04,249 --> 00:12:05,741
That does it.

209
00:12:05,786 --> 00:12:08,122
I'm going to stop talking
to the customers.

210
00:12:22,129 --> 00:12:26,436
You have been wronged
in this life.

211
00:12:26,473 --> 00:12:29,345
There is nothing left here
for you.

212
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,649
No honor...

213
00:12:31,687 --> 00:12:34,057
no future.

214
00:12:39,073 --> 00:12:40,941
Mmm...

215
00:12:40,978 --> 00:12:46,391
I wish to reclaim my honor
in the next life.

216
00:12:46,425 --> 00:12:49,159
I am ready to cross
the River of Blood

217
00:12:49,266 --> 00:12:52,867
and enter <i>Sto-Vo-Kor.</i>

218
00:12:55,014 --> 00:12:57,144
Commander.

219
00:12:57,187 --> 00:13:00,389
Odo, yesterday you called
Worf to the airlock

220
00:13:00,428 --> 00:13:01,897
to see some Klingon.

221
00:13:01,932 --> 00:13:03,128
That's right.

222
00:13:03,202 --> 00:13:04,262
Who was it?

223
00:13:04,305 --> 00:13:05,501
His name is Kurn.

224
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:07,672
It turns out
he's Worf's brother.

225
00:13:07,713 --> 00:13:09,411
Worf's brother.

226
00:13:09,451 --> 00:13:10,477
Oh, my god.

227
00:13:10,521 --> 00:13:12,389
Dax to Worf.

228
00:13:12,426 --> 00:13:14,660
Computer, locate Commander Worf.

229
00:13:14,698 --> 00:13:16,966
Commander Worf
is in his quarters.

230
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,030
Is he alone?

231
00:13:18,074 --> 00:13:20,136
Negative.
Captain Kurn is with him.

232
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:21,239
Come on.

233
00:13:29,938 --> 00:13:33,903
May this blade speed you
on your journey.

234
00:13:41,969 --> 00:13:45,239
Good-bye, my brother.

235
00:13:45,344 --> 00:13:49,811
Good... bye.

236
00:14:09,607 --> 00:14:10,576
Dax to Ops.

237
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,581
Emergency transport.
Two to the Infirmary.

238
00:14:12,615 --> 00:14:14,415
This is not your concern!
It is a private matter!

239
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:16,357
I doubt Captain Sisko
would agree.

240
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,862
You'd better hope
he lives, Commander.

241
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:22,305
If not, you'll be charged
with murder.

242
00:14:47,272 --> 00:14:48,673
Kurn's going to make it.

243
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:51,911
Julian said he'll be up
on his feet by tomorrow morning.

244
00:14:51,951 --> 00:14:53,181
Good.

245
00:14:53,221 --> 00:14:54,622
Mr. Worf, I want you to tell me

246
00:14:54,658 --> 00:14:57,962
why I shouldn't put you on
the next transport out of here.

247
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,994
You are well within your right
to do so.

248
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:02,010
I'm not talking about my rights.

249
00:15:02,044 --> 00:15:03,206
Answer my question.

250
00:15:03,247 --> 00:15:06,688
Captain, I do not
have an answer.

251
00:15:07,692 --> 00:15:09,025
Sir, I realize my actions

252
00:15:09,062 --> 00:15:11,432
were in violation
of Starfleet regulations...

253
00:15:11,468 --> 00:15:12,835
Regulations?

254
00:15:12,872 --> 00:15:15,640
We're not talking about some
obscure technicality, Mr. Worf.

255
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:17,673
You tried to commit
premeditated murder.

256
00:15:17,718 --> 00:15:20,156
Benjamin, it wasn't murder.

257
00:15:20,191 --> 00:15:22,459
Worf and Kurn were performing
a <i>Mauk-to'Vor</i> ritual.

258
00:15:22,497 --> 00:15:24,195
It's part of Klingon belief
that when...

259
00:15:24,234 --> 00:15:26,034
At the moment,
I don't give a damn

260
00:15:26,072 --> 00:15:29,046
about Klingon beliefs,
rituals, or custom!

261
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,880
Now, I have given you both
a lot of leeway

262
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:32,947
when it comes to following
Klingon traditions

263
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:35,828
but in case you haven't noticed,
this is not a Klingon station

264
00:15:35,865 --> 00:15:38,029
and those are not Klingon
uniforms you're wearing.

265
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:39,905
There is a limit
to how far I'll go

266
00:15:39,943 --> 00:15:42,974
to accommodate cultural
diversity among my officers

267
00:15:43,016 --> 00:15:44,714
and you've just reached it!

268
00:15:44,754 --> 00:15:46,748
When your brother is released
from the Infirmary

269
00:15:46,793 --> 00:15:49,061
you better find another way
to settle your family problems.

270
00:15:49,099 --> 00:15:51,036
Is that clear?!

271
00:15:51,071 --> 00:15:52,233
Captain, it may not
be possible...

272
00:15:52,274 --> 00:15:53,436
Uh, it's clear.

273
00:15:53,477 --> 00:15:56,245
There are definitely
other possibilities for Kurn.

274
00:15:56,285 --> 00:15:57,447
This will never happen again.

275
00:15:57,521 --> 00:15:58,854
You're damned right it won't!

276
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,623
Now, both of you... get out!

277
00:16:14,231 --> 00:16:15,427
What do you make of it, Chief?

278
00:16:15,534 --> 00:16:16,935
From these
magnetic flux readings

279
00:16:16,972 --> 00:16:19,912
the energy discharge we detected
could have been caused

280
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:21,779
by the destruction
of a cloaked target drone.

281
00:16:21,817 --> 00:16:22,979
Which would support the story

282
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,455
about conducting
military maneuvers.

283
00:16:24,558 --> 00:16:25,788
On the other hand

284
00:16:25,828 --> 00:16:28,357
this type of explosion
could also have been caused

285
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:30,463
by an accidental
warp nacelle inversion.

286
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,910
Or a blown plasma conduit
or a dozen other things.

287
00:16:32,946 --> 00:16:34,006
The bottom line is

288
00:16:34,049 --> 00:16:36,283
there's no way to be certain
from these readings.

289
00:16:36,322 --> 00:16:41,063
The larger question is:
What are these Klingons up to?

290
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:44,599
Whatever it is, they're doing it
awfully close to Bajoran space.

291
00:16:44,643 --> 00:16:46,375
And they're very touchy
about it.

292
00:16:46,415 --> 00:16:50,187
One thing I've had enough of is
tiptoeing around the Klingons.

293
00:16:50,225 --> 00:16:52,424
Take the <i>Defiant</i>
and run a sensor sweep

294
00:16:52,463 --> 00:16:54,058
of those coordinates.

295
00:16:54,101 --> 00:16:57,234
And if I run into the Klingons?

296
00:16:57,276 --> 00:16:59,840
Tell them that the ship
is conducting military exercises

297
00:16:59,883 --> 00:17:01,786
according
to interstellar agreements.

298
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:03,485
Understood.

299
00:17:03,592 --> 00:17:05,084
Should I take Worf?

300
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:08,502
I don't want Worf anywhere near
other Klingons right now.

301
00:17:08,539 --> 00:17:10,635
Keep him informed
of what's going on

302
00:17:10,677 --> 00:17:13,309
but under no circumstances
is he to accompany you.

303
00:17:13,351 --> 00:17:14,650
Is that clear?

304
00:17:14,688 --> 00:17:16,522
Yes, sir.

305
00:17:17,796 --> 00:17:19,288
Sir...

306
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:20,302
Don't say it, Chief.

307
00:17:20,336 --> 00:17:22,432
I've already got
one officer defending Worf.

308
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:23,807
I don't need two.

309
00:17:33,905 --> 00:17:35,374
He's stabilized.

310
00:17:35,408 --> 00:17:37,538
I can revive him any time.

311
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,346
Wake him.

312
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:46,294
I'll be just outside
if you need me.

313
00:17:59,972 --> 00:18:02,376
I...

314
00:18:02,412 --> 00:18:05,146
am... alive?

315
00:18:05,186 --> 00:18:06,587
Yes.

316
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:09,128
Commander Dax realized
what we were doing

317
00:18:09,163 --> 00:18:11,635
and she had you beamed
to the Infirmary.

318
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:19,452
I was looking forward
to being in <i>Sto-Vo-Kor.</i>

319
00:18:21,628 --> 00:18:24,466
I was hoping
to see Father there.

320
00:18:24,502 --> 00:18:27,304
He still awaits you

321
00:18:27,343 --> 00:18:30,408
but it is not yet time
for you to join him.

322
00:18:30,451 --> 00:18:35,921
And I suppose you will decide
when that time has come.

323
00:18:35,966 --> 00:18:38,906
It is not for me
to make that choice.

324
00:18:38,939 --> 00:18:40,499
Why not?

325
00:18:40,544 --> 00:18:44,920
You chose not to complete
the <i>Mauk-to'Vor</i> ritual.

326
00:18:44,955 --> 00:18:46,653
It was not my decision.

327
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:48,323
It was Dax and Odo
that prevented...

328
00:18:48,364 --> 00:18:49,663
Did you fight them?

329
00:18:49,701 --> 00:18:52,469
Did you threaten
to kill them both

330
00:18:52,508 --> 00:18:54,103
if they interfered?

331
00:18:54,146 --> 00:18:57,679
And are you standing here now
with the <i>mevak</i> dagger

332
00:18:57,721 --> 00:18:59,351
ready to slit my throat

333
00:18:59,393 --> 00:19:01,763
and bring me the death
I deserve?

334
00:19:04,339 --> 00:19:06,538
No.

335
00:19:10,957 --> 00:19:14,990
For a moment, in your quarters

336
00:19:15,033 --> 00:19:18,600
during the ritual...

337
00:19:18,643 --> 00:19:21,129
you were Klingon.

338
00:19:21,262 --> 00:19:25,969
But your Federation life
has claimed you again

339
00:19:26,008 --> 00:19:30,247
and now
it is claiming me as well.

340
00:19:30,285 --> 00:19:32,883
I have no life.

341
00:19:32,926 --> 00:19:36,230
I have no death.

342
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,442
Whatever is to become of me

343
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:44,989
is up to you.

344
00:19:51,007 --> 00:19:52,875
Enter.

345
00:19:58,526 --> 00:20:00,588
What can I do for you,
Commander?

346
00:20:00,631 --> 00:20:02,499
I wanted to apologize.

347
00:20:02,603 --> 00:20:05,007
I interfered in a family matter

348
00:20:05,043 --> 00:20:06,946
and if I caused
you and your brother

349
00:20:06,981 --> 00:20:09,077
any further dishonor, I'm sorry.

350
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,422
You were following
your conscience.

351
00:20:11,459 --> 00:20:13,396
That is an honorable motive.

352
00:20:13,431 --> 00:20:15,903
Not from a Klingon
point of view.

353
00:20:15,937 --> 00:20:18,637
You are not Klingon.

354
00:20:18,678 --> 00:20:21,150
Is there anything
I can do to help?

355
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,354
No.

356
00:20:25,396 --> 00:20:28,198
Okay.

357
00:20:28,236 --> 00:20:31,472
Commander.

358
00:20:31,511 --> 00:20:33,983
There is the question
of what to do next.

359
00:20:34,017 --> 00:20:35,509
Right.

360
00:20:35,555 --> 00:20:37,423
Do you have any ideas?

361
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,832
None.

362
00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:43,603
Well, in the short term,
there's no reason

363
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:46,811
why your brother can't stay here
on the station.

364
00:20:50,861 --> 00:20:54,063
If Kurn is to remain
on the station

365
00:20:54,103 --> 00:20:56,905
he will need tasks to perform.

366
00:20:56,944 --> 00:20:59,280
A job.

367
00:20:59,317 --> 00:21:00,912
What about security?

368
00:21:00,954 --> 00:21:04,190
It worked for one Klingon
officer I know.

369
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:07,068
Yes, but I doubt Kurn
would be interested

370
00:21:07,103 --> 00:21:08,835
in joining Starfleet.

371
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:13,946
Well, there is another
security force on the station.

372
00:21:17,698 --> 00:21:20,729
Well, your brother's had
an interesting career

373
00:21:20,772 --> 00:21:23,540
with the Klingon Defense Forces,
Mr. Worf.

374
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:25,379
I have just one question:

375
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:28,185
Does he know how to use
the stun setting

376
00:21:28,225 --> 00:21:29,592
on a disruptor?

377
00:21:29,629 --> 00:21:32,660
Nonlethal skills
are not valued in the Empire.

378
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:34,400
They are among my deputies.

379
00:21:34,441 --> 00:21:37,506
And if your brother is going
to be a member of my detachment

380
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:40,388
he's going to have to make some
adjustments in his thinking.

381
00:21:40,423 --> 00:21:42,657
He will.

382
00:21:42,696 --> 00:21:44,930
You're certain of that?

383
00:21:44,969 --> 00:21:48,239
I would not be asking you
to consider him if I were not.

384
00:21:48,277 --> 00:21:51,410
I can appreciate how difficult
it must be for you

385
00:21:51,452 --> 00:21:54,392
to be asking for a favor,
especially from me.

386
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,229
Very well.

387
00:21:57,267 --> 00:21:59,501
Have Kurn report here
tomorrow morning.

388
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,842
I am indebted to you.

389
00:22:01,879 --> 00:22:04,113
Yes, you are.

390
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,599
And Mr. Worf?

391
00:22:09,633 --> 00:22:13,370
You'll find I'm a man
who collects on his debts.

392
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,387
This container
is not on your manifest.

393
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:50,028
It must be a clerical error.

394
00:22:50,071 --> 00:22:51,506
I apologize.

395
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:53,307
Open it.

396
00:22:56,321 --> 00:22:58,816
This is a message
from Starfleet Command

397
00:22:58,894 --> 00:23:01,732
requesting an update
on our defense systems.

398
00:23:01,768 --> 00:23:05,301
I'd say your brother's
doing well, Commander.

399
00:23:05,344 --> 00:23:07,714
He's been on the job six hours

400
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:10,986
he's only killed
four Boslics so far.

401
00:23:11,025 --> 00:23:13,121
Hmm.

402
00:23:13,165 --> 00:23:14,965
Kira's right.

403
00:23:15,002 --> 00:23:16,905
You do need a sense of humor.

404
00:23:16,941 --> 00:23:18,639
He's quite good, actually.

405
00:23:18,678 --> 00:23:21,811
A little stern, but he never
steps over the line.

406
00:23:21,886 --> 00:23:24,050
I'm finding him to be
a pleasant surprise.

407
00:23:24,092 --> 00:23:26,690
I am...
gratified to hear that.

408
00:23:26,732 --> 00:23:28,167
I'm sure you are.

409
00:23:28,204 --> 00:23:31,110
Well, thanks
for the report, Commander.

410
00:23:31,144 --> 00:23:33,548
I'll give it
my immediate attention.

411
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,219
Brother.

412
00:23:36,257 --> 00:23:38,285
Kurn.

413
00:23:40,736 --> 00:23:42,468
I hate this uniform.

414
00:23:42,506 --> 00:23:44,032
I understand.

415
00:23:44,078 --> 00:23:47,109
The transition will probably
be difficult for some time.

416
00:23:47,152 --> 00:23:49,180
No, that's not what I mean.

417
00:23:49,224 --> 00:23:51,753
I have accepted the transition.

418
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:54,395
I am a Bajoran security officer.

419
00:23:54,437 --> 00:23:57,343
The uniform is
simply uncomfortable.

420
00:23:57,379 --> 00:23:58,575
I see.

421
00:23:58,615 --> 00:24:00,985
But I will get used to it.

422
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:04,394
You need not concern
yourself with me, Brother.

423
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:05,990
I won't disgrace you.

424
00:24:06,035 --> 00:24:08,097
I never doubted it.

425
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,666
Carry on.

426
00:24:22,945 --> 00:24:24,039
The same thing, Major.

427
00:24:24,082 --> 00:24:25,712
High concentrations
of tachyons

428
00:24:25,752 --> 00:24:29,923
subspace distortions,
and magneton traces.

429
00:24:29,963 --> 00:24:31,523
Some cloaked ships
definitely passed

430
00:24:31,568 --> 00:24:33,334
through this area
in the last 24 hours.

431
00:24:33,373 --> 00:24:35,435
They're getting close
to violating Bajoran space

432
00:24:35,478 --> 00:24:37,038
but they're never
crossing the line.

433
00:24:37,082 --> 00:24:38,882
I've never known Klingons
to be this fastidious

434
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:40,286
when it comes
to respecting borders.

435
00:24:40,324 --> 00:24:41,554
Especially when they're cloaked.

436
00:24:41,594 --> 00:24:42,654
Something's wrong here.

437
00:24:47,542 --> 00:24:49,980
That's a Vor'cha-class cruiser.

438
00:24:50,015 --> 00:24:51,484
Stand by shields and phasers.

439
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,648
They've been damaged.

440
00:24:52,688 --> 00:24:55,422
There's a massive hull breach
in their port quarter.

441
00:24:55,463 --> 00:24:56,591
Main power's failing.

442
00:24:56,633 --> 00:24:57,897
Casualties?

443
00:24:57,936 --> 00:24:59,702
It's hard to tell through
all this radiation.

444
00:24:59,741 --> 00:25:00,710
Open a channel.

445
00:25:00,743 --> 00:25:01,712
Channel open.

446
00:25:01,746 --> 00:25:04,480
This is Major Kira Nerys
on the USS <i>Defiant</i>

447
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:06,490
to unidentified Klingon vessel.

448
00:25:06,525 --> 00:25:08,223
Do you require assistance?

449
00:25:08,262 --> 00:25:11,430
This is IKS <i>Drovana</i>
to USS <i>Defiant.</i>

450
00:25:11,471 --> 00:25:13,237
We do not require assistance
at this time.

451
00:25:13,275 --> 00:25:14,437
Do not approach us.

452
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:16,974
Understood, <i>Drovana.</i>

453
00:25:17,052 --> 00:25:18,647
<i>Defiant</i> out.

454
00:25:20,361 --> 00:25:22,833
They're losing emergency power.

455
00:25:22,868 --> 00:25:24,964
Why aren't the other
Klingon ships helping them?

456
00:25:25,006 --> 00:25:27,000
Maybe they don't want to give
away their positions.

457
00:25:27,044 --> 00:25:28,172
Maybe they're busy

458
00:25:28,214 --> 00:25:30,344
doing something
that can't be interrupted.

459
00:25:30,387 --> 00:25:34,261
Something that blew a hole
the size of a house

460
00:25:34,297 --> 00:25:36,565
in a Vor'cha-class cruiser.

461
00:25:36,603 --> 00:25:38,871
Incoming transmission.

462
00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:40,378
<i>Drovana</i> to <i>Defiant.</i>

463
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:43,683
We need access
to your medical facilities.

464
00:25:44,925 --> 00:25:47,523
Our medical facilities
are extremely limited.

465
00:25:47,565 --> 00:25:51,405
If you wish, we can tow you
to Deep Space 9.

466
00:25:51,441 --> 00:25:52,774
Stand by.

467
00:25:57,357 --> 00:26:01,218
<i>Defiant,</i> your offer
is accepted.

468
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:07,768
Odo to Worf.

469
00:26:07,801 --> 00:26:08,929
Worf here.

470
00:26:08,971 --> 00:26:10,703
We need you in the Infirmary,
Commander.

471
00:26:10,742 --> 00:26:12,440
Your brother's
been seriously injured.

472
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,144
On my way.

473
00:26:19,365 --> 00:26:20,800
What happened?

474
00:26:20,868 --> 00:26:22,930
Kurn found a container
of contraband

475
00:26:22,974 --> 00:26:25,104
in the lower hold
of the Boslic ship.

476
00:26:25,146 --> 00:26:26,980
When he confronted their Captain

477
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:29,148
the man pulled out
a disruptor pistol

478
00:26:29,191 --> 00:26:31,219
and then Kurn
let himself get shot.

479
00:26:31,262 --> 00:26:32,731
Let himself?

480
00:26:32,766 --> 00:26:34,532
Kurn is a trained
Klingon warrior.

481
00:26:34,571 --> 00:26:36,337
He could have disarmed
the Boslic

482
00:26:36,376 --> 00:26:38,974
without breaking a sweat,
but he just stood there

483
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:41,487
let the man pull out
his weapon, aim and fire.

484
00:26:41,522 --> 00:26:44,655
The only thing that saved him
was the man was so frightened

485
00:26:44,697 --> 00:26:46,064
his hand was shaking.

486
00:26:46,101 --> 00:26:47,867
He'll be all right... again.

487
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:49,306
Good.

488
00:26:49,343 --> 00:26:52,647
A man with a death wish is
a danger not only to himself

489
00:26:52,684 --> 00:26:54,678
but to the rest of his team.

490
00:26:54,723 --> 00:26:58,027
Kurn's days
as a security officer are over.

491
00:26:58,065 --> 00:26:59,660
Would you like to see him?

492
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:00,693
Yes.

493
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:05,884
Thank you, Doctor.

494
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,107
How do you feel?

495
00:27:16,146 --> 00:27:19,086
Like a man who is
tired of waking up

496
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:21,557
and seeing
a human doctor's face.

497
00:27:21,593 --> 00:27:24,533
I thought we had agreed
that you would try to make...

498
00:27:24,567 --> 00:27:25,900
Worf...

499
00:27:26,004 --> 00:27:27,907
I don't want to talk anymore.

500
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:30,414
It's not Klingon.

501
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,546
You're the elder brother.

502
00:27:32,588 --> 00:27:35,117
You tell me what to do
and I'll do it.

503
00:27:35,161 --> 00:27:38,533
My life is in your hands.

504
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,240
Well, so far,
there's nothing unusual

505
00:27:54,278 --> 00:27:55,908
about any of their casualties.

506
00:27:55,949 --> 00:27:58,649
I've treated 15 cases
of severe radiation burns

507
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:01,892
seven thoracic perforation
traumas caused by shrapnel

508
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:04,130
and 23
decompression-related injuries.

509
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:05,434
All just what you'd expect

510
00:28:05,473 --> 00:28:07,273
following an explosion
on a starship.

511
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:09,475
Do you have any idea
what caused the explosion?

512
00:28:09,517 --> 00:28:10,645
Well, the radiation burns

513
00:28:10,687 --> 00:28:12,658
were the result
of exposure to gamma rays.

514
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:15,164
My guess is they were hit
by a photon torpedo.

515
00:28:15,199 --> 00:28:16,293
A torpedo?

516
00:28:16,335 --> 00:28:18,773
From the fracture
pattern of the damage

517
00:28:18,808 --> 00:28:21,542
I'd say something exploded
about ten kilometers

518
00:28:21,582 --> 00:28:23,212
off their port quarter.

519
00:28:23,253 --> 00:28:26,227
But torpedoes leave ion trails,
and the <i>Defiant</i>

520
00:28:26,261 --> 00:28:28,529
didn't pick up any
in the vicinity.

521
00:28:28,566 --> 00:28:29,865
And the <i>Drovana</i> was cloaked.

522
00:28:29,903 --> 00:28:31,897
Even Klingon torpedoes
can't track vessels

523
00:28:31,942 --> 00:28:33,036
operating under cloak.

524
00:28:34,449 --> 00:28:35,748
Mines.

525
00:28:35,786 --> 00:28:37,814
They hit a mine.

526
00:28:37,857 --> 00:28:40,763
That's why there
weren't any ion trails.

527
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,702
And cloaked mines
can't be detected

528
00:28:42,737 --> 00:28:44,229
by any known sensor array.

529
00:28:44,274 --> 00:28:46,040
But there have been
at least a dozen ships

530
00:28:46,112 --> 00:28:48,380
moving in and out of that system
since the explosion.

531
00:28:48,418 --> 00:28:49,853
Why haven't they
struck any mines?

532
00:28:49,888 --> 00:28:52,383
Well, the type of mine
currently used by the Klingons

533
00:28:52,428 --> 00:28:53,920
remains dormant
until it is armed

534
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:55,230
by a coded subspace signal.

535
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:57,605
So, the mine that damaged
the <i>Drovana</i>

536
00:28:57,642 --> 00:29:00,946
must have malfunctioned
or been set off prematurely.

537
00:29:00,984 --> 00:29:03,684
If we're right, there could be
thousands of mines

538
00:29:03,725 --> 00:29:06,858
out there right now, and we'd
have no way of knowing it.

539
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,392
Mining a star system
is an act of war.

540
00:29:08,437 --> 00:29:10,374
I didn't think the Klingons
were ready for that.

541
00:29:10,408 --> 00:29:12,744
At the moment,
we can't even prove

542
00:29:12,782 --> 00:29:15,152
these mines exist,
but if war comes

543
00:29:15,188 --> 00:29:18,060
the Klingons would be able
to cut off Deep Space 9

544
00:29:18,163 --> 00:29:19,895
and the entire Bajoran system.

545
00:29:19,933 --> 00:29:21,904
How do we find these mines?

546
00:29:21,939 --> 00:29:23,306
Unless we know their coordinates

547
00:29:23,342 --> 00:29:25,576
there's no way to find them
until we run into one.

548
00:29:25,614 --> 00:29:27,585
Then we better get
those coordinates.

549
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,782
The place to get them

550
00:29:28,824 --> 00:29:30,920
is docked
at Upper Pylon 3 right now.

551
00:29:30,962 --> 00:29:32,397
The only question is how.

552
00:29:32,432 --> 00:29:34,927
I have an idea.

553
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:38,774
You want me to turn
against my own people?

554
00:29:38,816 --> 00:29:40,548
Will my dishonor never end?

555
00:29:40,587 --> 00:29:43,425
It is their actions
that are dishonorable.

556
00:29:43,461 --> 00:29:47,267
Secretly mining star systems
is not the act of warriors.

557
00:29:47,304 --> 00:29:49,936
They behave like...
like Romulan cowards.

558
00:29:49,978 --> 00:29:53,476
Is that how you
rationalize this...

559
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,688
by calling your people cowards
so you can be a hero?

560
00:29:56,729 --> 00:30:00,262
Kurn, let me ask you this.

561
00:30:00,305 --> 00:30:02,469
Do you agree
with what has happened

562
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:04,538
between the Empire
and the Federation?

563
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:06,611
It is not my place
to criticize...

564
00:30:06,655 --> 00:30:08,181
Answer the question!

565
00:30:08,293 --> 00:30:11,665
No. I opposed the decision
to break the treaty

566
00:30:11,701 --> 00:30:13,797
but I was overruled in Council.

567
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,108
Why did you oppose the decision?

568
00:30:16,146 --> 00:30:19,416
Because Gowron
underestimates the Federation.

569
00:30:19,454 --> 00:30:23,328
He thinks they're soft, weak,
but he is wrong.

570
00:30:23,365 --> 00:30:25,529
Sooner or later,
there will be war.

571
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,042
A war the Empire may lose.

572
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:29,741
Yes.

573
00:30:29,781 --> 00:30:33,348
You know that mining this system
is just the beginning.

574
00:30:33,391 --> 00:30:35,920
If we do nothing,
it will only encourage Gowron

575
00:30:35,964 --> 00:30:38,528
to continue thinking
of the Federation as weak.

576
00:30:38,571 --> 00:30:41,568
Eventually, he will
attack, and that will be

577
00:30:41,612 --> 00:30:43,242
the end of the Empire.

578
00:30:43,283 --> 00:30:45,755
That is why you must join me
on this mission.

579
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:48,194
Not for my honor,
and not for the Federation

580
00:30:48,229 --> 00:30:50,701
but to prevent the Empire
from being destroyed

581
00:30:50,735 --> 00:30:52,501
in a war they cannot win.

582
00:30:55,448 --> 00:30:58,820
Our people have turned
their backs on us

583
00:30:58,856 --> 00:31:02,354
but we have not turned
our backs on them.

584
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:08,108
Let it be the sons of Mogh,
side by side, saving our people.

585
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:11,783
Do this with me.

586
00:31:18,173 --> 00:31:21,341
There. Very ugly.

587
00:31:24,156 --> 00:31:25,786
Well, uglier, that is.

588
00:31:25,827 --> 00:31:27,319
Joke.

589
00:31:27,397 --> 00:31:28,730
I got it.

590
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:33,177
Well, this will temporarily
alter your DNA signature

591
00:31:33,212 --> 00:31:35,650
to match one of our friends
over there.

592
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,588
Should be good enough
to pass a cursory test.

593
00:31:37,624 --> 00:31:39,025
How long will it last?

594
00:31:39,061 --> 00:31:40,360
About four hours.

595
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,372
That should be sufficient.

596
00:31:43,439 --> 00:31:44,908
Kurn.

597
00:31:47,316 --> 00:31:48,512
Kurn?

598
00:31:50,223 --> 00:31:51,590
Yes, Doctor?

599
00:31:51,627 --> 00:31:54,099
Please take a seat.

600
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,693
The deployment plan
for the mines

601
00:32:30,728 --> 00:32:32,596
should be
in the defense system database.

602
00:32:32,633 --> 00:32:34,536
I have found
the main file directory.

603
00:32:34,571 --> 00:32:35,699
No, no. Ignore it.

604
00:32:35,741 --> 00:32:36,801
It's a security procedure

605
00:32:36,844 --> 00:32:38,906
the High Council instituted
three months ago.

606
00:32:38,949 --> 00:32:40,441
False directories, files

607
00:32:40,487 --> 00:32:42,721
entire databases
of disinformation

608
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:44,993
designed for spies to steal.

609
00:32:45,032 --> 00:32:47,368
Here's the real database.

610
00:32:47,405 --> 00:32:49,467
Can you access
the deployment plan?

611
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,744
My security codes
have been changed

612
00:32:51,783 --> 00:32:53,116
but not all of them.

613
00:32:54,423 --> 00:32:55,915
Yes.

614
00:32:59,536 --> 00:33:01,632
You two...
what are you doing?

615
00:33:09,251 --> 00:33:11,746
We're running a diagnostic
of the computer core.

616
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,556
There have been
power fluctuations

617
00:33:13,595 --> 00:33:15,395
in the navigational
control system.

618
00:33:15,433 --> 00:33:17,962
I've not been informed
of any computer problems.

619
00:33:18,007 --> 00:33:21,311
Perhaps you have not been
tending to your duties.

620
00:33:21,348 --> 00:33:22,681
I do not know you.

621
00:33:22,718 --> 00:33:24,051
What is your name?

622
00:33:24,088 --> 00:33:27,392
I am Commander Sorval

623
00:33:27,431 --> 00:33:29,026
son of M'tokra.

624
00:33:29,068 --> 00:33:31,096
How long have you been
aboard, Commander?

625
00:33:31,141 --> 00:33:33,112
I will not be questioned
by a Lieutenant

626
00:33:33,213 --> 00:33:35,447
who should be cleaning
my quarters.

627
00:33:35,485 --> 00:33:38,516
Leave us, or I shall
have you stripped of rank

628
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,120
and sent home in a transport.

629
00:33:40,164 --> 00:33:42,898
My words were
ill-chosen, Commander.

630
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:46,971
Perhaps I can help you
with your investigation.

631
00:33:47,015 --> 00:33:48,952
That will not be necessary.
All we require...

632
00:33:56,206 --> 00:33:57,938
You did not have to do that.

633
00:33:57,977 --> 00:33:59,241
He was backing down.

634
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:08,664
He was going to kill you.

635
00:34:11,412 --> 00:34:12,711
We must hurry.

636
00:34:12,748 --> 00:34:15,916
The disruptor blast will
alert the security sensors.

637
00:34:15,956 --> 00:34:17,323
He was a warrior

638
00:34:17,361 --> 00:34:21,167
doing his duty,
defending the Empire

639
00:34:21,237 --> 00:34:23,037
and I killed him.

640
00:34:23,076 --> 00:34:25,640
My dishonor is complete.

641
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,595
Since we now have the detonation
codes for each mine

642
00:34:33,636 --> 00:34:36,370
we can set them off individually
or all at once.

643
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:37,811
Thank you, Commander.
Major?

644
00:34:37,847 --> 00:34:38,873
We'll take care of it.

645
00:34:38,916 --> 00:34:40,614
Congratulations, Mr. Worf.

646
00:34:40,654 --> 00:34:41,748
You did an excellent job.

647
00:34:41,791 --> 00:34:43,226
That goes for your brother, too.

648
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:45,458
Thank you, sir.

649
00:34:52,485 --> 00:34:54,684
You don't seem very pleased.

650
00:34:54,724 --> 00:34:58,861
I am still troubled by the death
of that Klingon officer.

651
00:34:58,902 --> 00:35:01,204
Your report said
it was self-defense.

652
00:35:01,241 --> 00:35:02,437
That is not the point.

653
00:35:02,478 --> 00:35:04,814
I should have seen
what he was going to do.

654
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:06,012
What do you mean?

655
00:35:06,053 --> 00:35:09,027
From the way you described it,
he was standing so close to you

656
00:35:09,061 --> 00:35:11,225
you couldn't have seen
the knife in his hand.

657
00:35:11,267 --> 00:35:12,497
He decided to kill me

658
00:35:12,537 --> 00:35:14,975
while I was looking him
right in the eyes

659
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,172
and I never saw it.

660
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:19,951
But Kurn did,
and he was three meters away.

661
00:35:21,794 --> 00:35:23,731
Worf, I don't think
you can tell

662
00:35:23,766 --> 00:35:26,034
someone's going to kill you
by looking at them.

663
00:35:26,072 --> 00:35:27,541
A Klingon can.

664
00:35:27,576 --> 00:35:29,011
It is an instinct.

665
00:35:29,046 --> 00:35:32,282
The ability
to look someone in the eyes

666
00:35:32,388 --> 00:35:34,222
and see the decision to kill.

667
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:37,666
An instinct I no longer have.

668
00:35:39,339 --> 00:35:41,310
Kurn was right.

669
00:35:41,412 --> 00:35:43,110
I have lived with humans so long

670
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,950
I no longer think
like a Klingon.

671
00:35:44,987 --> 00:35:47,755
For a long time, I have tried

672
00:35:47,795 --> 00:35:50,427
to walk the line between
the Empire and the Federation.

673
00:35:50,468 --> 00:35:52,997
I told myself
I could live in either world

674
00:35:53,042 --> 00:35:54,341
that it was my choice.

675
00:35:54,446 --> 00:35:59,721
But the truth is,
I cannot go back to the Empire.

676
00:35:59,759 --> 00:36:01,696
Do you want to go back?

677
00:36:06,344 --> 00:36:08,315
I had always hoped

678
00:36:08,415 --> 00:36:12,916
that one day the House of Mogh
would reclaim its rightful place

679
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,726
and that I would return.

680
00:36:14,765 --> 00:36:18,707
But now I know
that even if I did

681
00:36:18,742 --> 00:36:22,114
I have no place there.

682
00:36:24,491 --> 00:36:27,556
This is all I have.

683
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,231
Is that enough?

684
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,814
It will have to be.

685
00:36:39,295 --> 00:36:42,531
But my brother
does not even have this.

686
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:45,908
For him, there is no future
without the Empire...

687
00:36:45,946 --> 00:36:46,937
no life.

688
00:36:48,686 --> 00:36:50,155
It sounds like you're thinking

689
00:36:50,191 --> 00:36:52,459
of carrying out
the <i>Mauk-to'Vor</i> ritual again.

690
00:36:53,499 --> 00:36:55,059
No.

691
00:36:55,104 --> 00:36:56,596
I was able to do it once

692
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,910
by telling myself it was
an honorable Klingon ritual

693
00:36:59,949 --> 00:37:03,721
but now I cannot help
but think of it as humans do...

694
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:07,462
as murder.

695
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:15,816
What if there was a way
for you to kill your brother...

696
00:37:15,857 --> 00:37:18,591
without killing him?

697
00:37:27,253 --> 00:37:28,483
We're ready, Major.

698
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,688
Open a channel.

699
00:37:31,731 --> 00:37:33,634
This is the USS <i>Defiant</i>

700
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:36,404
to all Klingon vessels
near the Bajoran system.

701
00:37:36,444 --> 00:37:38,472
We are preparing
to destroy your minefield.

702
00:37:38,549 --> 00:37:40,109
I suggest you leave immediately.

703
00:37:40,153 --> 00:37:42,489
This is your only warning.

704
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,443
Anything?

705
00:37:49,477 --> 00:37:52,610
Nothing. If they're out there,
they're keeping quiet.

706
00:37:52,652 --> 00:37:54,623
Well, they're out there
all right

707
00:37:54,658 --> 00:37:57,723
and I think we'll
be seeing them fairly soon.

708
00:37:57,766 --> 00:38:01,002
Prepare to detonate the mine
in grid 21 alpha.

709
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:04,907
Ready, sir.

710
00:38:04,951 --> 00:38:06,546
Send out the code.

711
00:38:14,643 --> 00:38:16,375
Still nothing, Major.

712
00:38:16,414 --> 00:38:19,012
Well, we can't say
we didn't warn them.

713
00:38:19,055 --> 00:38:21,755
Detonate all the mines
in grids 22 alpha

714
00:38:21,795 --> 00:38:24,529
through 47 gamma.

715
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,128
Aye, sir.

716
00:38:35,029 --> 00:38:37,057
Just like flushing quail.

717
00:38:37,101 --> 00:38:39,665
They're setting course...

718
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:42,580
327 mark 215.

719
00:38:42,648 --> 00:38:44,414
Back to the Klingon Empire.

720
00:38:44,453 --> 00:38:47,723
Let's see how many other birds
we can flush out of here.

721
00:39:06,745 --> 00:39:08,739
Why is it that suicide

722
00:39:08,783 --> 00:39:12,452
is considered
a dishonorable death, Worf?

723
00:39:12,493 --> 00:39:14,897
Shouldn't a warrior
have the right

724
00:39:14,933 --> 00:39:18,135
to decide
when his time has come?

725
00:39:18,174 --> 00:39:20,908
If you die by your own hand

726
00:39:20,948 --> 00:39:25,449
you will not travel
across the River of Blood

727
00:39:25,494 --> 00:39:27,624
and enter <i>Sto-Vo-Kor.</i>

728
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:31,163
Even if I got cast down
into the Underworld

729
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:34,010
at least I'd be
with other Klingons

730
00:39:34,048 --> 00:39:37,420
even though they are
the dishonored dead.

731
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,896
Put down the disruptor.

732
00:39:46,047 --> 00:39:49,545
Do you know
what my one regret is, Worf?

733
00:39:49,589 --> 00:39:52,586
That we weren't raised together.

734
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:56,971
In the Empire, on Earth...
it wouldn't have mattered

735
00:39:57,008 --> 00:40:01,806
but the sons of Mogh should
have never been separated.

736
00:40:01,939 --> 00:40:03,203
On that...

737
00:40:03,243 --> 00:40:05,214
we both agree.

738
00:40:05,248 --> 00:40:06,912
But that is the past

739
00:40:06,952 --> 00:40:12,831
and a warrior
should look to the future.

740
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,275
And in the future

741
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:20,515
you should not be burdened
by my dishonor.

742
00:40:20,621 --> 00:40:23,459
You are not a burden.

743
00:40:23,495 --> 00:40:26,333
I have never understood you,
Worf.

744
00:40:28,041 --> 00:40:31,676
But I do know this.

745
00:40:31,717 --> 00:40:34,485
In your own way...

746
00:40:34,524 --> 00:40:38,432
you are an honorable man.

747
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:51,731
And you will be
an honorable man again...

748
00:40:51,769 --> 00:40:54,607
but not as my brother.

749
00:40:54,676 --> 00:40:56,806
How long will
the procedure take?

750
00:40:56,849 --> 00:41:00,017
Well, wiping his memory
will be relatively simple...

751
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:01,526
say, an hour...

752
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,029
but changing his genetic coding

753
00:41:03,065 --> 00:41:05,367
combined with surgically
altering his features

754
00:41:05,404 --> 00:41:07,568
will take at least
another five hours.

755
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:09,547
What will he remember?

756
00:41:09,581 --> 00:41:12,349
He'll know he's a Klingon
and how to speak the language

757
00:41:12,389 --> 00:41:14,588
and virtually everything
he needs to know

758
00:41:14,694 --> 00:41:16,824
in order to survive...
except who he is.

759
00:41:16,867 --> 00:41:19,339
And that's the first question
he'll ask.

760
00:41:19,374 --> 00:41:20,604
"Who am I?"

761
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,111
Do you have an answer?

762
00:41:26,492 --> 00:41:29,192
There is a man named Noggra

763
00:41:29,232 --> 00:41:31,796
a friend of our father's.

764
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,905
He will be arriving
in a few hours.

765
00:41:37,821 --> 00:41:41,422
He has agreed to provide Kurn
with a new identity

766
00:41:41,464 --> 00:41:43,094
and a new family.

767
00:41:43,136 --> 00:41:48,309
He will supply Kurn
with all the answers he needs.

768
00:41:48,349 --> 00:41:53,090
Are you absolutely
certain about this, Worf?

769
00:41:53,128 --> 00:41:56,125
Once I've erased
his memory engrams

770
00:41:56,169 --> 00:41:59,234
it'll be almost impossible
to restore them.

771
00:41:59,277 --> 00:42:01,111
He won't remember you

772
00:42:01,148 --> 00:42:04,851
or anything about his real life.

773
00:42:06,496 --> 00:42:08,592
It is the only way.

774
00:42:08,634 --> 00:42:09,694
You may begin.

775
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,418
Prep him for surgery.

776
00:42:27,751 --> 00:42:29,381
Rodek.

777
00:42:30,859 --> 00:42:33,661
Can you hear me?

778
00:42:33,699 --> 00:42:35,933
Rodek!

779
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:44,057
Where?

780
00:42:44,093 --> 00:42:45,757
Where am I?

781
00:42:45,798 --> 00:42:48,430
On a Federation space station.

782
00:42:48,471 --> 00:42:50,670
Our shuttle was damaged.

783
00:42:50,711 --> 00:42:53,913
You were hit
by a plasma discharge.

784
00:42:53,952 --> 00:42:57,416
I don't remember being...

785
00:42:57,461 --> 00:42:59,956
on a shuttle.

786
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:03,833
In fact, I don't
remember anything.

787
00:43:03,878 --> 00:43:07,182
The plasma discharge
damaged your hippocampus.

788
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:10,126
You're suffering
from a severe form of amnesia.

789
00:43:10,161 --> 00:43:12,463
I'm afraid you may never regain
all of your memory.

790
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:15,599
Who am I?

791
00:43:15,641 --> 00:43:17,943
Your name is Rodek.

792
00:43:17,981 --> 00:43:20,077
You are my son.

793
00:43:20,121 --> 00:43:22,787
You're part
of the House of Noggra

794
00:43:22,894 --> 00:43:24,728
a small but proud family.

795
00:43:24,766 --> 00:43:27,672
So don't worry.

796
00:43:27,707 --> 00:43:32,083
I will teach you all
that you have forgotten

797
00:43:32,118 --> 00:43:33,816
when we get home.

798
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:36,692
I understand, Father.

799
00:43:44,951 --> 00:43:46,581
Who are you?

800
00:43:46,622 --> 00:43:48,525
I am Worf.

801
00:43:48,561 --> 00:43:51,626
Are you part of my family?

802
00:43:55,245 --> 00:43:57,148
I have no family.
