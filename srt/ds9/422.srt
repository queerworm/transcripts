1
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:17,476
Kasidy Yates,
where are you going?

2
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:19,937
Down to my ship.

3
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:22,147
I have a meeting
with my engineer.

4
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:23,732
Go back to sleep.

5
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,526
You're the captain.

6
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,319
He'll wait.

7
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:29,864
Oh, is that how
you treat your staff?

8
00:00:29,864 --> 00:00:32,157
Make them wait around
while you're sleeping?

9
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:33,784
That's right.

10
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:36,495
In fact, there are days
when I never get out of bed.

11
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:38,873
You're not
making this easy.

12
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:40,415
That's the general idea.

13
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:41,667
(<i> moaning</i> )

14
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:47,088
You are evil.

15
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:52,511
I am a Starfleet officer--
the paragon of virtue.

16
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:55,096
You're more like
a<i> parody</i> of virtue...

17
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,682
but we'll have
to continue

18
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:58,017
this debate
another time.

19
00:00:58,017 --> 00:00:59,351
I can't wait.

20
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:00,853
See you later.

21
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,413
This briefing
will contain information

22
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:21,749
considered extremely sensitive
by Starfleet Command.

23
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:24,083
Please, do not share it
with anyone

24
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:27,004
who doesn't have
a level 7 security rating.

25
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:30,591
It seems that during their
recent invasion of Cardassia,

26
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:32,551
the Klingons inflicted
far more damage

27
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:34,344
than we've been led to believe.

28
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,137
Two weeks ago,

29
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:38,306
the civilian government
on Cardassia Prime

30
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,726
secretly contacted
the Federation Council

31
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:43,604
and made an urgent request
for industrial replicators

32
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:46,147
and that request
has been granted.

33
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:48,817
How many replicators
are we talking about?

34
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,652
12-- all Class IV.

35
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:53,363
The Federation only gave Bajor
<i>two</i> CFI replicators.

36
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,823
With all
due respect,

37
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,575
Bajor is just one planet.

38
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:59,369
The Klingons have destroyed
the industrial base

39
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,789
of literally dozens
of Cardassian worlds.

40
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,707
With 12 CFI replicators,
they can at least start building

41
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:05,542
new power plants
and factories.

42
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:08,128
Why all the secrecy?
Starfleet
Intelligence

43
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,006
believes the Maquis
may try to stop the shipment

44
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:13,133
or even seize the replicators
for themselves.

45
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,551
It makes sense.

46
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,470
The Cardassian military
has been so busy

47
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,055
fending off the Klingons,

48
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,681
they've basically given
a free hand to the Maquis

49
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,225
in the Demilitarized Zone.
The last thing

50
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,603
the Maquis are going to want
is to see a shipment

51
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:26,563
of replicators
on its way to Cardassia.

52
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,815
Intelligence also reports

53
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,608
that the Demilitarized Zone
between

54
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,318
Cardassia and
the Federation

55
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:32,903
has become a hotbed

56
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:34,780
of increasing terrorist
activity in the past month.

57
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,239
We suspect
the Maquis have built

58
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,950
several new bases
in the Badlands

59
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,286
and the Cardassians in the DMZ
are getting worried.

60
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,955
They should be.

61
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:44,957
Without the Cardassian military
to stop them,

62
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:47,334
the Maquis have
a perfect opportunity

63
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:50,712
to drive the Cardassians
out of the DMZ permanently.

64
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,715
I take it this shipment is going
to pass through Deep Space 9?

65
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,092
Yes, sir.
In three days.

66
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,678
All right.

67
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,429
Let's tighten security
on the station.

68
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,057
Step up random checks of
incoming and outgoing cargo

69
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:05,102
for weapons or explosives,
more deputies on the Promenade.

70
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:06,478
You know the drill.

71
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:09,314
Understood.
Mr. Worf, tomorrow, I want you

72
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,108
to take the<i> Defiant</i>
and patrol the Badlands.

73
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:13,527
Show the flag.
Let the Maquis know

74
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:14,695
we're ready
for any trouble.

75
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,321
Aye, sir.

76
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,365
Mr. Eddington,
I want daily briefings on this

77
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,659
until the replicators
are in Cardassian hands.

78
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:21,618
Aye, sir.

79
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,703
Dismissed.

80
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:30,460
The, uh, Commander and I

81
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,337
would like to have
a word with you.

82
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,714
Something wrong?

83
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:36,508
Captain...

84
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:37,926
it's come to
our attention

85
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,720
that there may be
a Maquis smuggler

86
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,055
here on the station.

87
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,598
Oh?

88
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,017
It's just a theory
at this point,

89
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:46,768
and frankly,
our suspicions are based

90
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,063
on purely
circumstantial evidence.

91
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:50,355
Who is it?

92
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,066
Again, we're
still not certain.

93
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:54,776
I understand that.
Who?

94
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,946
Gentlemen?

95
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,742
Kasidy Yates.

96
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,239
Kasidy?

97
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,365
Working for the Maquis?

98
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,868
That's impossible.

99
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,452
ODO:
I certainly hope so.

100
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,289
Smuggling with intent to supply
a terrorist organization

101
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,748
is a serious offense.

102
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,209
Where is your evidence?

103
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:20,588
Five months ago, Captain Yates
was hired by the Bajorans

104
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:23,424
to carry cargo
to their outlying colonies.

105
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:26,761
One of her regular runs
is from Bajor

106
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,723
to a colony on Dreon VII.

107
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,851
It's a 12-hour run
for most ships,

108
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,686
but she always takes 18.

109
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,063
The six-hour difference

110
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,856
is just enough
time to allow her

111
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,482
to make a side trip
into the Badlands,

112
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,109
rendezvous
with a Maquis ship,

113
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,528
and then continue on
to the Dreon system.

114
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,655
<i>That's</i> your evidence?

115
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,949
That she was<i> slow</i>
in one of her deliveries?

116
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,159
There's more.

117
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,869
Starfleet Intelligence

118
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,495
has infiltrated
one of the Maquis cells

119
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,622
and obtained a partial list
of their contacts

120
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:55,874
in the Bajoran sector.

121
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:57,334
They all had cover names

122
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,086
of course, but one
of their contacts

123
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,795
started living
aboard Deep Space 9

124
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,672
in the last six months.

125
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:05,300
And Captain Yates has been
living aboard the station

126
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,261
for just under six months.

127
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:10,180
That's damned slim evidence
to base an accusation.

128
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,307
We haven't<i> made</i> 
any accusations.

129
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:13,808
I said we have suspicions.

130
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,063
That's right, you did say that.

131
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,522
Captain, I realize
this is

132
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,024
an awkward
situation for you,

133
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,360
but if I could step up
my surveillance

134
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,527
of Captain Yates...

135
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,781
Odo, she's a Federation citizen.

136
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,824
You can't just
invade her privacy

137
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,451
based on your suspicions.

138
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,370
You'll have to show me
some real evidence

139
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,455
before I'll authorize
what you're proposing.

140
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,165
EDDINGTON:
If she's really
a Maquis,

141
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,376
then she's no longer
a Federation citizen.

142
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,501
The answer is no.

143
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:43,422
Understood, sir.

144
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,178
Gentlemen.

145
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,641
There are times
we have to search vessels

146
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,893
docked at the station.

147
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,854
If you can find a reason...

148
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,108
We'll let you know.

149
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:23,462
(<i> groans</i> )

150
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:24,504
(<i> crowd exclaims</i> )

151
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,214
(<i> chiming</i> )

152
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,424
Yeah, Nerys!

153
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,842
There you go.

154
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,511
(<i> panting</i> )

155
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,846
Did you see the way

156
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,348
she gave him
the tiniest head fake

157
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:36,350
and then boom--
checked him into the wall?

158
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,768
Yes, it was quite effective.

159
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:43,398
Stop watching her.

160
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:44,983
Oh, I thought the whole point
<i>was</i> to watch.

161
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,861
The point is
to watch the game,
not the spectators--

162
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,404
especially not that spectator.

163
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,989
Well, what does she expect?

164
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,367
She's the only Cardassian woman
on the station.

165
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:56,161
She<i> must</i> know she's bound
to attract<i> some</i> attention.

166
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,875
Some, yes.
Yours, no.

167
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:06,004
Oh, come on!
That was a foul.

168
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,007
Yeah!

169
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:16,556
Perhaps I should say hello
after the game.

170
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,142
That's Gul Dukat's daughter.

171
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,394
And I can't think
of anyone in the galaxy

172
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,437
who hates you more
than he does.

173
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,231
Besides, Ziyal is
a friend of Kira's,

174
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,066
and I wouldn't play around
with her if I were you.

175
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,360
(<i> cheering</i> )

176
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,445
I simply thought it would be
polite to say hello,

177
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,613
but clearly,
you don't think I'm capable

178
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,866
of conducting any kind
of pleasant discourse

179
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:35,867
without some kind

180
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,618
of nefarious
ulterior motive.

181
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,454
That's not what I meant.

182
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,248
I just think you should leave
well enough alone.

183
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,207
Why stir up...?

184
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:43,542
Yes!

185
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:46,044
Well played!

186
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,004
Brava, Major!

187
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,632
What happened?

188
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,927
A brilliant move
on the part of the Major.

189
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,929
You should have been
paying attention.

190
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,701
(<i> door chimes</i> )

191
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,120
Come in.

192
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,038
Did you know you
could smell that

193
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,748
all the way down
the corridor?

194
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,208
It's an experiment.

195
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,627
Bajoran<i> ratamba</i> stew
over spinach linguine.

196
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,670
Don't your neighbors
ever complain?

197
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,714
Sometimes, but usually
it's only an excuse

198
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,425
to get a taste
of my cooking.

199
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:34,801
Oh, how sneaky
of them.

200
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,595
Yes, they are
a duplicitous bunch.

201
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:37,554
Mmm.

202
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,013
(<i> door opens</i> )

203
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,642
All right, you two.
Break it up.

204
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,186
I've got a problem.
Do either of you know

205
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,105
what a Kavarian tiger-bat
smells like?

206
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,942
It's for a story
I'm working on.

207
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,652
The computer database
has plenty of pictures,

208
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,654
but no olfactory information.

209
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,655
You're a writer.

210
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,948
Make something up.

211
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:58,699
I'm going
for a real

212
00:10:58,699 --> 00:10:59,951
"you are there" feeling.

213
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,328
The details have to be right.

214
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,912
Kas, haven't you been
to Kavaria?

215
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,956
Not me. Sorry.

216
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:07,708
Don't you make
a regular cargo run

217
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,169
to a neighboring system?

218
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,338
No. Kavaria's out
towards the Badlands.

219
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,006
I try to stay away from there.

220
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,382
You should ask Quark.

221
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:17,051
I bet he knows someone
who's been out that way.

222
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,596
I thought you made deliveries
to Dreon VII.

223
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,515
That's<i> near</i> the Badlands,
isn't it?

224
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,975
I guess it depends
on how you define "near."

225
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,769
On my ship, Dreon's a long way
from the Badlands.

226
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:31,899
What route do you take
to the Dreon system?

227
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,235
I imagine you go around
the Rolor Nebula.

228
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,446
If you're really this interested
in my flight plans,

229
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:37,989
why don't you look them up?

230
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:40,867
You are the commander
of the station, after all.

231
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:44,245
Forget I brought it up.

232
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:48,333
Okay, everyone grab a plate
and prepare to be dazzled.

233
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,086
You first.

234
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,630
Hmm-mm.

235
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:36,089
You're not going
to hurt me, are you?

236
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,132
Normally, I would
simply make

237
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:41,302
a strategic withdrawal
at the first sign of trouble,

238
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,097
but there doesn't seem
to be a way out of here.

239
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:49,394
You could always call Security.

240
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:52,897
Oh, true, but it would take them
a few minutes to arrive,

241
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:56,234
and by then,
it might be too late.

242
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,238
I don't think I'll hurt you.

243
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:04,075
I'm gratified to hear that.

244
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,578
In fact, I think
it's safe to say

245
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:08,787
you have nothing
to fear from me.

246
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:14,628
And you, my dear, have
nothing to fear from me.

247
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,434
MALE:
This is ridiculous.

248
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:30,851
We have perishable goods
in the hold

249
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,853
and we cannot allow...
What is going on here?

250
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:35,898
Captain, we need
to make a class-2
inspection of your cargo

251
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,651
before we can allow you
to leave the station.

252
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,319
Inspection?
For what?

253
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,237
Temecklian virus.

254
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,864
There've been some reports
of an outbreak on Bajor,

255
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,742
so we're scanning
all ships and cargo

256
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,368
before they leave the system.

257
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,245
None of my cargo
came from Bajor.

258
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,080
I'm afraid the rules are
very strict, no exceptions.

259
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,207
How long
will this take?
Six hours.

260
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,627
Six hours?
We'll miss
the rendezvous.

261
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:57,378
We'll see about that.

262
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,677
Kasidy?

263
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,094
I'm sorry to bother you, Ben.

264
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,887
Normally, I wouldn't
do this, but--

265
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,181
What is it?

266
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,557
It's this health
inspection.

267
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,392
They're telling me
it's going

268
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,561
to take six hours,
but I need to make a rendezvous

269
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,313
with a Tholian freighter
in nine hours,

270
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:17,691
and you know how they are
about punctuality.

271
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:19,776
If it weren't
for the health concern, maybe,

272
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:20,819
but in this case...

273
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:22,403
Ben, please.

274
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,197
I promise to flood
the entire cargo hold

275
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,407
with baryon radiation
as a precaution,

276
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,368
but I need to go now,
or I'll lose

277
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:31,245
the entire consignment.

278
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,955
Stand by.

279
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:38,002
Is there any way we can make
a shorter inspection?

280
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,004
Not if they're going to search
for contraband

281
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,131
while they make it look
like a health inspection.

282
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,592
They need time to look
for camouflage fields,

283
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,220
false cargo manifests,
computer records.

284
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,682
We probably shouldn't bother
at this point.

285
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,600
If Kasidy's in a hurry,

286
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,811
she'll be standing over
their shoulders the whole time.

287
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,313
They won't be able
to make much of a search.

288
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:00,191
Captain, I strongly recommend
that we at least try.

289
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:09,158
You are clear to leave
the station-- just remember

290
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,202
to irradiate that cargo.

291
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:12,453
Thanks, Ben.
I owe you one.

292
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,538
See you tomorrow.

293
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:21,045
Do you have something
to say, Commander?

294
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,047
No, sir.
Good.

295
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,465
Now get down to the<i> Defiant,</i>

296
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,467
and tell Worf he has
a change of orders.

297
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:30,346
I want you to follow the<i> Xhosa.</i>

298
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,015
Aye, sir.
What are our orders

299
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,893
if we observe Captain Yates
meeting a Maquis ship?

300
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,564
Right now, your orders
are to observe,

301
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,482
then report directly to me.

302
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:42,776
Is that clear?

303
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,110
Perfectly.

304
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,793
The<i> Xhosa's</i> altering course,
Commander.

305
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:04,046
Now on heading 158 mark 325.

306
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,590
The Badlands.

307
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,800
Stay with her, Chief.

308
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,842
Aye, sir.

309
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,111
Say what you will
about the Maquis,

310
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,613
they're not stupid.

311
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,657
Using the Badlands as
their base of operations

312
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:31,783
was a pretty smart move.

313
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,576
Not to mention
a gutsy one.

314
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:37,037
They are terrorists--
little more than criminals.

315
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,666
And criminals
always make mistakes.

316
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,627
They're just fighting
for something they believe in.

317
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,879
They should be hunted down
and destroyed.

318
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:45,839
What for?

319
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,424
Defending their homes?

320
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,343
Look at what's happened
to those people--

321
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,720
one day, they're
eking out a living

322
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,682
in some godforsaken colonies
on the Cardassian border.

323
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,434
The next day,
the Federation makes a treaty

324
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,728
handing those colonies over
to the Cardassians.

325
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,188
What would you do?

326
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,524
I would not become a terrorist.

327
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,233
It would be dishonorable.

328
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:09,654
I wouldn't say that
around Major Kira if I were you.

329
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,366
How about you, Commander?

330
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,952
How do you feel
about the Maquis?

331
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:19,580
I don't have any feelings
about them one way or the other.

332
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,834
Oh, but you must have
an opinion.
I do my job, Chief.

333
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:25,085
Starfleet says to find the
Maquis, I'll find the Maquis.

334
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,462
They tell me to help them,
I'll help them.

335
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,339
My opinion
is irrelevant.

336
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:32,010
What matters to me is doing
my job like a Starfleet Officer.

337
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,513
Anything else...
is an indulgence.

338
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,516
(<i> console beeping</i> )

339
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,018
I think I've got something.

340
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:43,521
An impulse signature
off the starboard bow.

341
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:45,815
Bring us within visual range.

342
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,025
Aye, sir.

343
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,240
O'BRIEN:
That's a Maquis raider.

344
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,870
And the<i> Xhosa's</i> beaming
over her cargo.

345
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:13,968
Hello.

346
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:15,595
Hello.

347
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,931
This is your shop.

348
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,974
Yes.

349
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,352
It's very nice.

350
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,979
Thank you.

351
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:28,315
You do good work.

352
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,777
How kind.

353
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,909
Is there something
I can do for you?

354
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:43,790
I got this holosuite program
from Quark.

355
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:47,334
It's a reproduction
of a Cardassian sauna.

356
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:50,254
Like the ones
they have back home.

357
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,799
Yes.

358
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,175
I was wondering if you...

359
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,971
might be interested
in trying it out with me.

360
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,513
Oh.

361
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,140
I mean, we're
the only

362
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,101
Cardassians on the station

363
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:06,896
and, well, the temperature's
too hot for almost anyone else.

364
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:09,690
I see.

365
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,693
When were you thinking of?

366
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,654
Maybe the day after tomorrow.

367
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,114
Say 2100?

368
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,410
I'd be delighted.

369
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,997
Great.

370
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,040
I'll see you there.

371
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,126
I look forward to it.

372
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,266
Morning.

373
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,560
Morning.

374
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,771
<i>Raktajino,</i> extra sweet.

375
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,731
Makapa bread, no crust.

376
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,275
What happened
to juice and oatmeal?

377
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,903
Kasidy introduced me to this.

378
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,947
It's great.

379
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,991
When's she due back?

380
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:01,159
Tonight.

381
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:05,913
Oh, don't worry.

382
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,498
It's supposed to do that.

383
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:11,002
The foam tastes like a...
a weird peppermint,

384
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:13,129
and the bread...

385
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:15,715
I don't know
what it tastes like.

386
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,424
You want some?

387
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,802
I think I'll pass.

388
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:22,722
Dad, is something wrong?

389
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:25,016
I'm a little tired.

390
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:27,935
Didn't get much
sleep last night.

391
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:33,066
I guess you're not used
to sleeping alone anymore.

392
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,526
What I mean is,

393
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:38,237
you miss her<i> companionship...</i>

394
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,865
you miss<i> talking,</i>

395
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:43,534
and sharing<i> insights</i>
about command and duty...

396
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:46,996
All right, that's enough.
I was just kidding.

397
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:49,248
I know.

398
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:53,711
I've just got
a lot on my mind.

399
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:56,422
Something happen
between you and Kasidy?

400
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,507
Not exactly.

401
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,263
If you want to talk...

402
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,475
What?

403
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,272
This is important.

404
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,482
You and I.

405
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,860
Things change...

406
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,821
but... not this.

407
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,994
Forget it.
I'm just having a bad day.

408
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,337
EDDINGTON:
<i>After the cargo</i>

409
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:39,381
was beamed
aboard the Maquis raider,

410
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,008
the<i> Xhosa</i> took this route
out of the Badlands

411
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:44,178
and resumed its course
to Dreon VII.

412
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:46,305
Do you know what cargo was
transferred to the Maquis ship?

413
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,307
From the residual
transporter signature,

414
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,643
it was approximately
80 percent organic.

415
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,728
I'd say food
or possibly medical supplies.

416
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,563
Well, at least we're not dealing
with weapons.

417
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,232
It sounds
like she's only providing...

418
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:57,984
Where is the<i> Xhosa</i> now?

419
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:00,778
WORF:
Captain Yates is on her
way back to the station.

420
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:02,863
She should arrive at 1900 hours.

421
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,785
Thank you.
Dismissed.

422
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,047
Dismissed, old man.

423
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:28,139
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

424
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,031
(<i> door chimes</i> )

425
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:47,074
(<i> sighs</i> )

426
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,784
Come in.

427
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,288
Miss me?

428
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:55,624
Were you gone?

429
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:59,503
Admit it-- without me,
you cried yourself to sleep.

430
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:07,678
So, did you make your rendezvous
with the Tholian freighter?

431
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:09,263
Right on time,
and thank you

432
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:11,598
for bending
the inspection rules for me.

433
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,726
We'd never have made it
without you.

434
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:16,145
Just don't make a habit of it.

435
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:18,147
I promise.

436
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:20,816
Where did you meet
the Tholians anyway?

437
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,109
In the Dreon system?

438
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,237
Yeah. Why?

439
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:27,405
It just seemed odd
that they would
travel that far

440
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:29,283
just for some
medical supplies.

441
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:30,534
They really needed them.

442
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,828
They've got some kind
of viral infection

443
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,412
on one of their colonies.

444
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:35,789
In fact, I can't stay long--

445
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,125
I'm supposed
to make a run tonight.

446
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:41,087
But I promise you can inspect
the cargo ahead of time.

447
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:43,297
That'll make Odo
very happy.

448
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:47,343
Hey, you're back.

449
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:48,844
Looks like it to me.

450
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,180
Are you guys doing
anything right now?

451
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,516
I just got a new holosuite
program that Nog sent me.

452
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:57,435
It's a baseball game
between the 1961 Yankees

453
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:58,604
and the 1978 Red Sox.

454
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,689
I'll buy the hot dogs.

455
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:01,899
I'll have to pass.

456
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:03,859
I have to get
back to Ops.

457
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,070
Anyway, the Yankees
will bury them.

458
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,280
You two have fun.

459
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,531
But I'm only here
for a few hours.

460
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:10,866
Duty calls.

461
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,826
I'll see when you get back.

462
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,038
Okay.

463
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:25,714
She's going
on another run tonight.

464
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:28,259
She seemed prepared for
a cargo inspection this time,

465
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:30,177
so I doubt
you'll find anything.

466
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,929
Captain...

467
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:34,514
Mr. Eddington and I
have discussed this at length,

468
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,558
and we both feel
that if the<i> Xhosa</i>

469
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,312
makes another rendezvous
with a Maquis raider,

470
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:42,773
we should seize both vessels
and arrest everyone aboard.

471
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:45,276
For all we know, the<i> Xhosa</i> may
not make another run for months.

472
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:48,237
We shouldn't let this
opportunity pass us by.

473
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:49,738
Agreed.

474
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,657
Yes, sir.

475
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:55,869
And that does bring up another
point I'd like to discuss...

476
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,830
in private,
if I may.

477
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,420
Sir, the CFI replicators

478
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,339
are due to arrive here
tomorrow afternoon.

479
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:08,674
I'd feel better if I were
here to supervise

480
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:09,800
the security detail.

481
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,509
Lieutenant Reese can handle it.

482
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:13,179
Yes, sir, he can, but...

483
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,098
Just say it, Commander.

484
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:19,310
Sir, if the Maquis
put up a fight

485
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,978
the<i> Xhosa</i> might get caught
in the crossfire.

486
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:22,480
If that happens,
I can't guarantee

487
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,647
the safety of Kasidy Yates.

488
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,399
And to be blunt,

489
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:27,276
I don't want
that responsibility.

490
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,236
I can't say I blame you.

491
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:33,991
The security of the CFI
replicators is your priority.

492
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:36,452
I'll take command
of the<i> Defiant.</i>

493
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,120
Thank you, Captain.

494
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,799
The inspection team
just left.

495
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,009
Any problems?

496
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:53,010
No.

497
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,512
Kasidy.

498
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:56,389
I'll be right there.

499
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,101
How was the game?

500
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,520
Good.

501
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,896
Seven-three, Yankees.

502
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:09,902
Did you come all the way
down here for the score?

503
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:12,029
No.

504
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:14,240
I was just thinking--

505
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,076
why don't we drop everything
and go to Risa?

506
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,536
Just the two of us.

507
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:21,080
Now?
We won't even
pack a bag.

508
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,875
We'll walk straight out of here,
get in a runabout and go.

509
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,835
What about your station?

510
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,504
I have a great crew.

511
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:32,425
They can handle things
around here for a few days.

512
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:39,390
Neither of us is doing
anything so important

513
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:42,476
that it can't wait
for a few days.

514
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:45,563
I'm not sure
the Tholians would agree.

515
00:26:45,563 --> 00:26:48,232
Let your first officer
handle it.

516
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:50,859
Or better yet,
tell the Tholians

517
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:54,447
they won't be getting
this shipment at all.

518
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:57,866
I don't think
I can do that, Ben.

519
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:02,037
I... I-I have a commitment
to fulfill.

520
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,750
(<i> sighs</i> )

521
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,877
But if you want
to take a runabout

522
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:12,672
and wait for me on Risa,
I'll meet you there.

523
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,972
Forget about it.

524
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:23,392
It was just a crazy idea.

525
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:26,228
Have a good trip.

526
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:28,564
Thanks.

527
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:39,825
It was a tempting idea, Ben.

528
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:45,164
I wish I could
take you up on it.

529
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:48,167
So do I.

530
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:00,762
(<i> sighs</i> )

531
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:06,143
O'BRIEN:
They're reducing speed.

532
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:08,228
Match their
velocity, Chief.

533
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,771
These are the same coordinates

534
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,357
they used
for the last rendezvous.

535
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:13,691
Any sign of another ship?

536
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:15,235
Not yet, but our sensors

537
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,279
are extremely limited
in the plasma fields.

538
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:20,866
They're turning again.

539
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:23,202
Looks like a holding
pattern to me, sir.

540
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:27,414
Either the Maquis are late
or the<i> Xhosa's</i> early.

541
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:30,125
Either way, we wait with them.

542
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,338
Can't you do something
about these lapels?

543
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:35,464
Such as?

544
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:37,633
I don't know.
I'm not a tailor.

545
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:39,301
Just... make them look good.

546
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:41,428
Oh, make them look good.
And all this time,

547
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,138
I thought you wanted me to
try to make them look bad.

548
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,431
I wish you'd said
that before.

549
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,058
It's much simpler

550
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:48,060
when the customer
explains what he wants.

551
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,728
Rudeness will
get you nowhere.

552
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,189
I don't need
another waiter.

553
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:56,235
Now, I want more room
in the shoulders and these cuffs

554
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:57,570
are completely
unacceptable.

555
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,446
Garak, can I talk
to you for a minute?

556
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:00,656
GARAK:
Of course, Major.

557
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:02,324
Excuse me.

558
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:04,117
Sure.

559
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:08,205
Now, what can I do
for you, Major--

560
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:09,831
Listen closely.

561
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,500
I don't know what kind
of sick game it is

562
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,252
you're playing with Ziyal

563
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:14,794
but it better stop and it
better stop right now.

564
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:16,255
I can assure
you, Major, I--

565
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:18,173
I don't want to hear
any of your lies.

566
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,676
Now, that girl is here
under<i> my</i> protection,

567
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:23,596
and I swear, if you do
anything to hurt her,

568
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:26,098
I will make you regret it.
Is that clear?

569
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,350
As Tabalian glass.

570
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,851
Good.

571
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:38,110
You told her.

572
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,905
The pants are about
a meter too long.

573
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:48,412
So, are you canceling
your date with Ziyal?

574
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,749
It's not a date.

575
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:53,417
And how do you
know about that?

576
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:56,836
You're a man, she's a woman,
it's a date.

577
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:59,005
And they are my holosuites,
after all.

578
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:04,970
I was going to cancel.

579
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,598
I'd had visions of Ziyal
presenting my head

580
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:09,308
to her father
as a birthday gift.

581
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,851
That's a little paranoid,
wouldn't you say?

582
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:13,437
Paranoid is what
they call people

583
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:15,855
who<i> imagine</i> threats
against their life.

584
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:18,358
I<i> have</i> threats against my life.

585
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:22,446
But after my little "chat"
with Major Kira,

586
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:24,573
I feel much better.

587
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:25,532
You do?

588
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:26,992
Isn't it obvious?

589
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:28,619
If Ziyal planned to kill me,

590
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:30,788
Kira would not be trying
to warn me away.

591
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:32,080
On the contrary,

592
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,833
the good major
would also welcome

593
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:38,003
my untimely demise
and do nothing to interfere.

594
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:39,838
Unless that's part of the plan.

595
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,923
What do you mean?

596
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:45,135
Oh, you know, Kira acts like
she doesn't want you to go

597
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:47,805
so you'll feel
everything's okay,

598
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:50,056
and then
you go anyway.

599
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:53,852
No, it's too complicated.

600
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:58,148
Of course.

601
00:30:58,148 --> 00:31:00,942
Now they're too short.

602
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,235
What?

603
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,529
The pants.

604
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:05,030
Oh.

605
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:22,130
This is wrong.

606
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,007
Terrorists don't work this way.

607
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,051
If your contact
doesn't show up

608
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:27,927
for a rendezvous,
you leave.

609
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:29,929
You don't stay
in the Badlands

610
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:32,307
going in circles
for five hours.

611
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,852
Perhaps.
But it is also possible

612
00:31:34,852 --> 00:31:37,103
that her cargo
is so valuable to the Maquis

613
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:39,939
that she will wait
as long as it takes
to make her delivery.

614
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,902
I think she's already
made her delivery.

615
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,904
And you were the cargo.

616
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,407
Think about it--
if anyone

617
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:49,991
but Kasidy Yates
was on the<i> Xhosa,</i>

618
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,077
would you be commanding
this mission yourself?

619
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:54,246
You're saying someone
wanted me here? Why?

620
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:57,249
I'm not sure, but one thing's
certain, we're not going

621
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:58,917
to find the answers sitting here
staring at the viewscreen.

622
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,919
You're right.

623
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,921
The answers
are over there.

624
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,381
Let's go.

625
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:06,049
Mr. Worf, you have the Bridge.

626
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:18,687
Still nothing.

627
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:20,814
This is getting ridiculous.

628
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:22,441
All right, let's send
a coded message...

629
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:23,609
(<i> alarm sounds</i> )

630
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:25,318
Tachyon surge.

631
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,112
A ship's de-cloaking.

632
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,074
Oh, my God.

633
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:37,831
Ben. What are you doing here?
We've been...

634
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:39,082
Don't say it!

635
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,751
I know that
you're a smuggler.

636
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:43,002
I know that you've been
working with the Maquis,

637
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,963
and right now, I don't care.

638
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,173
But I need to know
what your orders were.

639
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:49,718
Were you told to draw me
out here so the Maquis

640
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:51,720
could attack the station?
Ben, I--

641
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,221
Jake's back there.

642
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,765
And whatever your
feelings are for me,

643
00:32:54,765 --> 00:32:56,850
I can't believe you
would put him in danger.

644
00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:01,647
I was supposed to meet a Maquis
ship at these coordinates.

645
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:04,483
I don't know anything
about an attack on the station.

646
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,652
And I doubt the Maquis
would try.

647
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:08,612
I didn't know
you were following me,

648
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:10,155
but after our last talk,

649
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:12,616
I suspected
that you might be out there.

650
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:15,869
If that's true, why didn't you
abort the mission?

651
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:18,747
I was told that these
medical supplies

652
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:20,039
were urgently needed,

653
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:22,542
and that I had to be here
no matter what.

654
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,169
I tried to tell them
that I'd made

655
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,963
too many runs
in the last few days--

656
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:28,715
that I was just asking
to get caught,

657
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,801
but they wouldn't listen.

658
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:33,219
They knew you were
going to be caught.

659
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,973
That's why they didn't
send a Maquis ship

660
00:33:35,973 --> 00:33:37,516
out here to meet you.

661
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:40,894
Everything's been
building to this.

662
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:42,938
They needed to draw me
away from the station.

663
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:45,732
Why? If they aren't planning
an attack,

664
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,066
what other reason
could there be?

665
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,902
What could be happening...?

666
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:52,322
Happening on the station.

667
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:55,575
I've received new orders
from Starfleet Command.

668
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,076
The CFI replicators
in Cargo Bay 17

669
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:59,120
are to be transferred
aboard a Vulcan freighter

670
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,080
which should arrive
at any moment.

671
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,959
This operation is to be
carried out in complete secrecy.

672
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:06,085
No one aboard the station
is to know about it.

673
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:09,255
Does that include
the Bajoran security
detachment, sir?

674
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,256
Absolutely.

675
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,591
Also, as of this moment,

676
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,468
we're observing
communications silence.

677
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,595
No com traffic in or out
of the station

678
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,222
for the next nine hours.
Understood?

679
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:19,307
Aye, sir.
Dismissed.

680
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,782
You wanted to see me?
Yes, Major.

681
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,367
I'm afraid I need
to take command

682
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:40,037
of the station
for the next few hours.

683
00:34:40,037 --> 00:34:41,329
(<i> groans</i> )

684
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,521
We've cleared
the plasma field, Captain.

685
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,231
Get us back to the
station, Chief.

686
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,233
Maximum warp.
Aye, sir.

687
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,693
Any response from
our hails, Commander?

688
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:12,736
WORF:
No, sir.

689
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:14,071
Deep Space 9 seems to be

690
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:15,948
under
a communications blackout.

691
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:17,365
Keep trying.

692
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,910
You realize
we'll probably never see

693
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,828
the<i> Xhosa</i>
or Captain Yates again.

694
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,122
It's a possibility.
I'd say it's
more than that.

695
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,875
If I'd been allowed to leave
a security detail behind--

696
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,711
Our priority is
to get back to
the station, Constable.

697
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:32,171
Captain Yates is
my responsibility,

698
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:34,591
and I'll thank you
to leave it at that.

699
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:36,802
As you wish.

700
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:52,400
The replicators
have been secured

701
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,778
in the ship's hold, sir.
Very good.

702
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:56,571
We'll be departing
in five minutes,

703
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,990
and I'm leaving you
in command

704
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,240
until Captain Sisko returns.

705
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,784
Me, sir?

706
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:02,160
You have a problem
with that, Lieutenant?

707
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,536
No, sir.

708
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:05,288
It's just that's
it's unusual

709
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,457
for a junior officer
to be left--

710
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:10,002
If you're not up to the job,
I'll find someone else who is.

711
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:11,920
The safety of this station
may depend on you

712
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,379
and I need to know
if you can handle it.

713
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:15,340
You can count
on me, Commander.

714
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,549
Good.

715
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:18,343
Now go to Ops
and take command.

716
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:20,219
Yes, sir.

717
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,112
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

718
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:38,697
<i>The</i> Defiant<i> has returned</i>
<i>to the station,</i>

719
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,740
<i>but it seems</i>
<i>that Commander Eddington</i>

720
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,283
<i>is still one step ahead of us.</i>

721
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,243
O'BRIEN:
All Federation starships
near the Badlands

722
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:45,871
have been alerted to look
for the Vulcan freighter.

723
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:47,372
I doubt they'll find it.

724
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:49,666
Eddington anticipated
every contingency.

725
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:52,377
I'm sure he had
his escape route well planned.

726
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,880
What do we tell
the Cardassians?
The truth.

727
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,132
He fooled me,
and he got away with it.

728
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:58,383
He fooled all of us.

729
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:00,802
Everything that happens
on this station

730
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,595
is<i> my</i> responsibility,
Major.

731
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,305
(<i> console beeps</i> )

732
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:06,683
Incoming message
for you, Captain.

733
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:08,935
It's from Commander Eddington.

734
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:11,146
Put it through, in my office.

735
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:17,485
Captain.

736
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:20,739
Mr. Eddington,
I have just one question.

737
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:21,823
Why?

738
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:23,658
Will knowing
my personal motivation

739
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,202
change anything
at this point?

740
00:37:25,202 --> 00:37:26,828
No, I don't suppose it will.

741
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:29,122
Then let's table
that for now.

742
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:31,332
The only reason
I've contacted you

743
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:33,877
is to ask you
to leave us alone.

744
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:36,379
Our quarrel is
with the Cardassians,

745
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,797
not the Federation.

746
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:40,341
Leave us alone,
and I can promise you

747
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:42,052
you'll never hear
from the Maquis again.

748
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:45,304
Unless you see another shipment
you want to hijack.

749
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:48,683
You keep sending replicators
to Cardassia, and you're going

750
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,186
to have a lot more
to worry about than hijackings.

751
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:52,854
I don't respond well to threats.

752
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:54,689
I thought you
would know that by now,

753
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:57,192
but I'm beginning to see
that you don't know me at all.

754
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:58,610
I know you.

755
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:02,155
I was like you once,
but then I opened my eyes.

756
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:04,699
Open your eyes, Captain.

757
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:07,035
Why is the Federation
so obsessed with the Maquis?

758
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:11,372
We've never harmed you, and yet
we're constantly arrested

759
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,791
and charged with terrorism.

760
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:15,585
Starships chase us
through the Badlands

761
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:18,880
and our supporters are harassed
and ridiculed. Why?

762
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,840
Because we've left
the Federation,

763
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,843
and that's the one thing
you can't accept.

764
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:26,304
Nobody leaves paradise.

765
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,807
Everyone should want
to be in the Federation.

766
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:31,059
Hell, you even want
the Cardassians to join.

767
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:32,602
You're only sending them
replicators

768
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:35,230
because one day they can take
their rightful place

769
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,065
on the Federation Council.

770
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:41,527
You know, in some ways,
you're even worse than the Borg.

771
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:44,739
At least they tell you about
their plans for assimilation.

772
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,950
You're more insidious.

773
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:50,662
You assimilate people,
and they don't even know it.

774
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,749
You know what, Mr. Eddington?

775
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,668
I don't give a damn
what you think

776
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:59,420
of the Federation,
the Maquis, or anything else.

777
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:03,382
All I know is that you betrayed
your oath, your duty and me.

778
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:06,094
And if it takes me
the rest of my life,

779
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:08,387
I will see you standing
before a court-martial

780
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:09,555
that'll break you

781
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,641
and send you to a penal colony

782
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:14,519
where you will spend the rest
of your days growing old

783
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:17,022
and wondering whether
a ship full of replicators

784
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:19,524
was really worth it.

785
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:32,453
Garak?

786
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:33,788
Hello.

787
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,707
Doesn't it feel good?

788
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:38,293
The station can be
so chilly sometimes.

789
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:39,585
Yes.

790
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:42,797
It's quite pleasant.

791
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,465
Aren't you going to lie down?

792
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,551
Uh, not just yet.

793
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:49,304
I have a question I'd
like answered first.

794
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:51,056
Why am I here?

795
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:52,515
Excuse me?

796
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,184
Why am I here?

797
00:39:54,184 --> 00:39:57,979
Am I to believe
that you've invited

798
00:39:57,979 --> 00:39:59,772
the sworn enemy
of your father

799
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:03,026
simply to enjoy
the heat?

800
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,698
You really think
I asked you here to kill you.

801
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,244
Well, it did occur to me.

802
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:16,331
Kira and my father both told me
that you used to be an agent

803
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:18,750
of the Obsidian Order.
Oh.

804
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,002
That you had
my grandfather tortured

805
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:23,546
and killed, and that you
could easily kill me

806
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,340
without a second thought.

807
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:28,927
Although I seldom credit
the major or your father

808
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:31,096
with being entirely trustworthy,

809
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:36,726
in this case,
they're both telling the truth.

810
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:39,312
You know what else is true?

811
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:41,522
I don't care.

812
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:45,151
I'm half-Bajoran, and that means
I'm an outcast back home.

813
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:48,487
I<i> can't</i> go back
and neither can you.

814
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:51,283
So, we can either
share some time together

815
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:53,534
or we can ignore
each other.

816
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:57,080
I spent five years in a
prisoner of war camp by myself.

817
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,124
I don't<i> need</i> your company,

818
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:05,297
but if you'd like to stay
and share the heat with me,

819
00:41:05,297 --> 00:41:06,547
maybe tell me something

820
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:09,508
about home
that I don't know,

821
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:12,845
then I would welcome
your company

822
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:16,557
and I get the feeling
you would welcome mine.

823
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:19,769
Either way, it's up to you.

824
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:31,948
Well... it seems I won't
be needing this anymore.

825
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:45,086
(<i> sighing contentedly )</i>

826
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,134
So...

827
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:53,470
what shall we talk about first?

828
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:11,612
Just you?

829
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:12,864
I dropped my crew off

830
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:14,657
at a Maquis base.

831
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:18,244
I<i> had</i> to come back,
but I didn't see any reason

832
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,997
to drag them here
just to face a prison sentence.

833
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:23,500
You didn't have
to come back either.

834
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:27,170
Yes. I did.

835
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,047
And I think we both know

836
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:31,966
that's why you left us
alone out there--

837
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,719
to see if I would.

838
00:42:36,513 --> 00:42:40,558
I'm not going to stand here
and apologize for what I did.

839
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:43,144
You had your duty.

840
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:45,230
I had mine.

841
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,941
I still have my duty.

842
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:52,487
I know.

843
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:55,865
And I know
I'll probably go to prison.

844
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:02,038
But I came back because of us.

845
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:05,208
Because despite
all that's happened,

846
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:07,960
I still love you, Ben.

847
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:12,549
I don't want to throw that away.

848
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:15,468
Do you?

849
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:19,764
No.

850
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:49,668
Lieutenant Reese.

851
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:59,137
I'll be back.

852
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:01,889
I'll be here.
