1
00:00:16,567 --> 00:00:18,937
Kasidy Yates,
where are you going?

2
00:00:18,974 --> 00:00:20,877
Down to my ship.

3
00:00:20,912 --> 00:00:23,214
I have a meeting
with my engineer.

4
00:00:23,252 --> 00:00:24,687
Go back to sleep.

5
00:00:24,722 --> 00:00:26,716
You're the Captain.

6
00:00:26,761 --> 00:00:28,230
He'll wait.

7
00:00:28,265 --> 00:00:30,897
Oh, is that how
you treat your staff?

8
00:00:30,938 --> 00:00:33,240
Make them wait around
while you're sleeping?

9
00:00:33,278 --> 00:00:34,747
That's right.

10
00:00:34,782 --> 00:00:37,620
In fact, there are days
when I never get out of bed.

11
00:00:37,656 --> 00:00:40,026
You're not making this easy.

12
00:00:40,062 --> 00:00:41,463
That's the general idea.

13
00:00:45,275 --> 00:00:48,077
You are evil.

14
00:00:48,117 --> 00:00:52,458
I am a Starfleet officer...
the paragon of virtue.

15
00:00:53,698 --> 00:00:56,296
You're more like
a parody of virtue...

16
00:00:56,371 --> 00:00:59,209
but we'll have to continue
this debate another time.

17
00:00:59,246 --> 00:01:00,408
I can't wait.

18
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:01,941
See you later.

19
00:01:19,163 --> 00:01:20,827
This briefing
will contain information

20
00:01:20,868 --> 00:01:23,306
considered extremely sensitive
by Starfleet Command.

21
00:01:23,341 --> 00:01:25,643
Please, do not share it
with anyone

22
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:28,313
who doesn't have
a level 7 security rating.

23
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:32,022
It seems that during their
recent invasion of Cardassia

24
00:01:32,064 --> 00:01:33,967
the Klingons inflicted
far more damage

25
00:01:34,002 --> 00:01:35,973
than we've been led to believe.

26
00:01:36,007 --> 00:01:37,637
Two weeks ago

27
00:01:37,678 --> 00:01:39,774
the civilian government
on Cardassia Prime

28
00:01:39,817 --> 00:01:42,119
secretly contacted
the Federation Council

29
00:01:42,156 --> 00:01:45,028
and made an urgent request
for industrial replicators

30
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:47,696
and that request
has been granted.

31
00:01:47,738 --> 00:01:50,370
How many replicators
are we talking about?

32
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,142
12... all Class IV.

33
00:01:52,182 --> 00:01:55,054
The Federation only gave Bajor
two CFI replicators.

34
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,030
With all due respect,
Bajor is just one planet.

35
00:01:58,065 --> 00:02:00,867
The Klingons have destroyed
the industrial base

36
00:02:00,905 --> 00:02:03,139
of literally dozens
of Cardassian worlds.

37
00:02:03,178 --> 00:02:05,308
With 12 CFI replicators,
they can at least start building

38
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,253
new power plants and factories.

39
00:02:07,288 --> 00:02:08,348
Why all the secrecy?

40
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:09,688
Starfleet Intelligence

41
00:02:09,728 --> 00:02:12,360
believes the Maquis
may try to stop the shipment

42
00:02:12,402 --> 00:02:14,601
or even seize the replicators
for themselves.

43
00:02:14,641 --> 00:02:15,974
It makes sense.

44
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,879
The Cardassian military
has been so busy

45
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:19,112
fending off the Klingons

46
00:02:19,152 --> 00:02:21,282
they've basically given
a free hand to the Maquis

47
00:02:21,325 --> 00:02:22,521
in the Demilitarized Zone.

48
00:02:22,562 --> 00:02:23,792
The last thing

49
00:02:23,832 --> 00:02:26,066
the Maquis are going to want
is to see a shipment

50
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,972
of replicators
on its way to Cardassia.

51
00:02:28,009 --> 00:02:29,239
Intelligence also reports

52
00:02:29,278 --> 00:02:31,306
that the Demilitarized Zone
between

53
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,915
Cardassia and the Federation
has become a hotbed

54
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:36,260
of increasing terrorist
activity in the past month.

55
00:02:36,297 --> 00:02:37,789
We suspect
the Maquis have built

56
00:02:37,834 --> 00:02:39,394
several new bases
in the Badlands

57
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,972
and the Cardassians in the DMZ
are getting worried.

58
00:02:43,014 --> 00:02:44,040
They should be.

59
00:02:44,084 --> 00:02:46,579
Without the Cardassian military
to stop them

60
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,892
the Maquis have
a perfect opportunity

61
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,200
to drive the Cardassians
out of the DMZ permanently.

62
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:55,440
I take it this shipment is going
to pass through Deep Space 9?

63
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,847
Yes, sir.
In three days.

64
00:02:57,853 --> 00:02:59,220
All right.

65
00:02:59,256 --> 00:03:00,954
Let's tighten security
on the station.

66
00:03:00,994 --> 00:03:03,432
Step up random checks of
incoming and outgoing cargo

67
00:03:03,468 --> 00:03:06,636
for weapons or explosives,
more deputies on the Promenade.

68
00:03:06,676 --> 00:03:07,736
You know the drill.

69
00:03:07,779 --> 00:03:09,579
Understood.

70
00:03:09,617 --> 00:03:10,847
Mr. Worf, tomorrow, I want you

71
00:03:10,887 --> 00:03:12,721
to take the <i>Defiant</i>
and patrol the Badlands.

72
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,819
Show the flag.

73
00:03:13,862 --> 00:03:16,334
Let the Maquis know
we're ready for any trouble.

74
00:03:16,368 --> 00:03:17,359
Aye, sir.

75
00:03:17,403 --> 00:03:19,898
Mr. Eddington,
I want daily briefings on this

76
00:03:19,943 --> 00:03:22,279
until the replicators
are in Cardassian hands.

77
00:03:22,316 --> 00:03:23,285
Aye, sir.

78
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,310
Dismissed.

79
00:03:30,705 --> 00:03:31,969
The, uh, Commander and I

80
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:33,843
would like to have
a word with you.

81
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,349
Something wrong?

82
00:03:36,353 --> 00:03:38,347
Captain...

83
00:03:38,392 --> 00:03:39,622
it's come to our attention

84
00:03:39,662 --> 00:03:41,360
that there may be
a Maquis smuggler

85
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,835
here on the station.

86
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,139
Oh?

87
00:03:45,176 --> 00:03:46,645
It's just a theory
at this point

88
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,446
and frankly,
our suspicions are based

89
00:03:48,484 --> 00:03:50,683
on purely
circumstantial evidence.

90
00:03:50,724 --> 00:03:51,657
Who is it?

91
00:03:51,693 --> 00:03:53,755
Again, we're still not certain.

92
00:03:53,798 --> 00:03:55,233
I understand that.

93
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:56,431
Who?

94
00:03:58,377 --> 00:03:59,778
Gentlemen?

95
00:04:01,418 --> 00:04:03,355
Kasidy Yates.

96
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:05,732
Kasidy?

97
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,930
Working for the Maquis?

98
00:06:07,973 --> 00:06:09,237
That's impossible.

99
00:06:09,276 --> 00:06:10,370
I certainly hope so.

100
00:06:10,413 --> 00:06:13,751
Smuggling with intent to supply
a terrorist organization

101
00:06:13,855 --> 00:06:15,154
is a serious offense.

102
00:06:15,191 --> 00:06:16,957
Where is your evidence?

103
00:06:18,634 --> 00:06:22,098
Five months ago, Captain Yates
was hired by the Bajorans

104
00:06:22,143 --> 00:06:24,945
to carry cargo
to their outlying colonies.

105
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:28,220
One of her regular runs
is from Bajor

106
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:31,256
to a colony on Dreon VII.

107
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,468
It's a 12-hour run
for most ships

108
00:06:34,508 --> 00:06:36,172
but she always takes 18.

109
00:06:36,213 --> 00:06:39,312
The six-hour difference
is just enough time to allow her

110
00:06:39,354 --> 00:06:41,052
to make a side trip
into the Badlands

111
00:06:41,092 --> 00:06:42,687
rendezvous with a Maquis ship

112
00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:45,099
and then continue on
to the Dreon system.

113
00:06:45,136 --> 00:06:47,198
That's your evidence?

114
00:06:47,242 --> 00:06:49,612
That she was slow
in one of her deliveries?

115
00:06:49,647 --> 00:06:50,980
There's more.

116
00:06:51,018 --> 00:06:51,987
Starfleet Intelligence

117
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,082
has infiltrated
one of the Maquis cells

118
00:06:54,126 --> 00:06:56,360
and obtained a partial list
of their contacts

119
00:06:56,398 --> 00:06:57,526
in the Bajoran sector.

120
00:06:57,568 --> 00:06:59,128
They all had cover names

121
00:06:59,173 --> 00:07:00,871
of course,
but one of their contacts

122
00:07:00,977 --> 00:07:02,641
started living
aboard Deep Space 9

123
00:07:02,681 --> 00:07:04,413
in the last six months.

124
00:07:04,453 --> 00:07:07,085
And Captain Yates has been
living aboard the station

125
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:08,595
for just under six months.

126
00:07:08,631 --> 00:07:12,003
That's damned slim evidence
to base an accusation.

127
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:14,067
We haven't made
any accusations.

128
00:07:14,111 --> 00:07:15,911
I said we have suspicions.

129
00:07:18,022 --> 00:07:19,856
That's right, you did say that.

130
00:07:19,927 --> 00:07:22,867
Captain, I realize this is
an awkward situation for you

131
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,135
but if I could step up
my surveillance

132
00:07:25,173 --> 00:07:26,301
of Captain Yates...

133
00:07:26,343 --> 00:07:29,579
Odo, she's a Federation citizen.

134
00:07:29,618 --> 00:07:31,748
You can't just
invade her privacy

135
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,317
based on your suspicions.

136
00:07:33,361 --> 00:07:35,161
You'll have to show me
some real evidence

137
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,363
before I'll authorize
what you're proposing.

138
00:07:37,405 --> 00:07:38,897
If she's really a Maquis

139
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:41,243
then she's no longer
a Federation citizen.

140
00:07:41,282 --> 00:07:42,410
The answer is no.

141
00:07:44,122 --> 00:07:45,455
Understood, sir.

142
00:07:50,873 --> 00:07:52,274
Gentlemen.

143
00:07:54,115 --> 00:07:56,679
There are times
we have to search vessels

144
00:07:56,722 --> 00:07:58,886
docked at the station.

145
00:07:58,927 --> 00:08:01,833
If you can find a reason...

146
00:08:03,105 --> 00:08:05,167
We'll let you know.

147
00:08:28,137 --> 00:08:29,265
Yeah, Nerys!

148
00:08:29,307 --> 00:08:30,833
There you go.

149
00:08:33,752 --> 00:08:34,721
Did you see the way

150
00:08:34,754 --> 00:08:36,280
she gave him
the tiniest head fake

151
00:08:36,325 --> 00:08:38,262
and then boom...
checked him into the wall?

152
00:08:38,296 --> 00:08:40,768
Yes, it was quite effective.

153
00:08:43,276 --> 00:08:45,338
Stop watching her.

154
00:08:45,381 --> 00:08:47,011
Oh, I thought the whole point
was to watch.

155
00:08:47,052 --> 00:08:48,112
The point is

156
00:08:48,156 --> 00:08:49,888
to watch the game,
not the spectators...

157
00:08:49,927 --> 00:08:51,328
especially not that spectator.

158
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,833
Well, what does she expect?

159
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:55,396
She's the only Cardassian woman
on the station.

160
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,312
She must know she's bound
to attract some attention.

161
00:09:01,323 --> 00:09:03,818
Some, yes.
Yours, no.

162
00:09:05,366 --> 00:09:06,426
Oh, come on!

163
00:09:06,469 --> 00:09:07,938
That was a foul.

164
00:09:09,946 --> 00:09:10,937
Yeah!

165
00:09:15,292 --> 00:09:18,494
Perhaps I should say hello
after the game.

166
00:09:18,534 --> 00:09:20,972
That's Gul Dukat's daughter.

167
00:09:21,007 --> 00:09:22,374
And I can't think
of anyone in the galaxy

168
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,381
who hates you more
than he does.

169
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,715
Besides, Ziyal is
a friend of Kira's

170
00:09:25,753 --> 00:09:27,313
and I wouldn't play around
with her if I were you.

171
00:09:30,398 --> 00:09:32,494
I simply thought it would be
polite to say hello

172
00:09:32,537 --> 00:09:34,565
but clearly,
you don't think I'm capable

173
00:09:34,609 --> 00:09:36,911
of conducting any kind
of pleasant discourse

174
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:39,513
without some kind
of nefarious ulterior motive.

175
00:09:39,555 --> 00:09:40,922
That's not what I meant.

176
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,193
I just think you should leave
well enough alone.

177
00:09:43,232 --> 00:09:44,201
Why stir up?

178
00:09:44,234 --> 00:09:45,635
Yes!

179
00:09:45,672 --> 00:09:48,076
Well played!

180
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,013
Brava, Major!

181
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,586
What happened?

182
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,859
A brilliant move
on the part of the Major.

183
00:09:55,898 --> 00:09:57,960
You should have been
paying attention.

184
00:10:20,863 --> 00:10:22,196
Come in.

185
00:10:22,233 --> 00:10:24,136
Did you know
you could smell that

186
00:10:24,171 --> 00:10:25,903
all the way down the corridor?

187
00:10:25,942 --> 00:10:27,070
It's an experiment.

188
00:10:27,112 --> 00:10:29,641
Bajoran <i>ratamba</i> stew
over spinach linguine.

189
00:10:29,685 --> 00:10:31,679
Don't your neighbors
ever complain?

190
00:10:31,724 --> 00:10:33,888
Sometimes, but usually
it's only an excuse

191
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,525
to get a taste of my cooking.

192
00:10:35,567 --> 00:10:36,968
Oh, how sneaky of them.

193
00:10:37,005 --> 00:10:38,737
Yes, they are
a duplicitous bunch.

194
00:10:38,775 --> 00:10:39,766
Mmm.

195
00:10:42,452 --> 00:10:44,754
All right, you two.
Break it up.

196
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,226
I've got a problem.

197
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:47,355
Do either of you know

198
00:10:47,398 --> 00:10:49,392
what a Kavarian tiger-bat
smells like?

199
00:10:51,074 --> 00:10:52,475
It's for a story I'm working on.

200
00:10:52,511 --> 00:10:54,675
The computer database
has plenty of pictures

201
00:10:54,717 --> 00:10:56,688
but no olfactory information.

202
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:57,691
You're a writer.

203
00:10:57,725 --> 00:10:59,217
Make something up.

204
00:10:59,262 --> 00:11:01,928
I'm going for a real
"you are there" feeling.

205
00:11:01,969 --> 00:11:03,461
The details have to be right.

206
00:11:03,507 --> 00:11:04,999
Kas, haven't you been
to Kavaria?

207
00:11:05,043 --> 00:11:07,173
Not me. Sorry.

208
00:11:07,216 --> 00:11:09,654
Don't you make
a regular cargo run

209
00:11:09,689 --> 00:11:11,090
to a neighboring system?

210
00:11:11,126 --> 00:11:13,360
No. Kavaria's out
towards the Badlands.

211
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:15,165
I try to stay away from there.

212
00:11:15,204 --> 00:11:16,868
You should ask Quark.

213
00:11:16,908 --> 00:11:19,176
I bet he knows someone
who's been out that way.

214
00:11:19,214 --> 00:11:21,743
I thought you made deliveries
to Dreon VII.

215
00:11:21,787 --> 00:11:23,883
That's near the Badlands,
isn't it?

216
00:11:23,927 --> 00:11:26,297
I guess it depends
on how you define "near."

217
00:11:26,332 --> 00:11:29,397
On my ship, Dreon's a long way
from the Badlands.

218
00:11:31,345 --> 00:11:34,319
What route do you take
to the Dreon system?

219
00:11:34,386 --> 00:11:36,688
I imagine you go around
the Rolor Nebula.

220
00:11:36,726 --> 00:11:39,164
If you're really this interested
in my flight plans

221
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,498
why don't you look them up?

222
00:11:40,536 --> 00:11:43,510
You are the Commander
of the station, after all.

223
00:11:44,847 --> 00:11:46,647
Forget I brought it up.

224
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:50,890
Okay, everyone grab a plate
and prepare to be dazzled.

225
00:11:53,737 --> 00:11:54,706
You first.

226
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,141
Hmm-mm.

227
00:12:37,015 --> 00:12:39,613
You're not going
to hurt me, are you?

228
00:12:39,656 --> 00:12:41,718
Normally, I would simply make

229
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:44,861
a strategic withdrawal
at the first sign of trouble

230
00:12:44,903 --> 00:12:47,809
but there doesn't seem
to be a way out of here.

231
00:12:50,384 --> 00:12:52,879
You could always call Security.

232
00:12:52,924 --> 00:12:56,457
Oh, true, but it would take them
a few minutes to arrive

233
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:59,939
and by then,
it might be too late.

234
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,876
I don't think I'll hurt you.

235
00:13:05,155 --> 00:13:06,834
I'm gratified to hear that.

236
00:13:06,967 --> 00:13:09,166
In fact, I think
it's safe to say

237
00:13:09,207 --> 00:13:11,509
you have nothing
to fear from me.

238
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:17,391
And you, my dear, have
nothing to fear from me.

239
00:13:30,395 --> 00:13:32,093
This is ridiculous.

240
00:13:32,132 --> 00:13:34,661
We have perishable goods in the
hold and we cannot allow...

241
00:13:34,706 --> 00:13:35,675
What is going on here?

242
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:36,678
Captain, we need

243
00:13:36,712 --> 00:13:38,512
to make a class-2
inspection of your cargo

244
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,544
before we can allow you
to leave the station.

245
00:13:40,588 --> 00:13:42,183
Inspection?
For what?

246
00:13:42,225 --> 00:13:43,855
Temecklian virus.

247
00:13:43,896 --> 00:13:46,562
There've been some reports
of an outbreak on Bajor

248
00:13:46,603 --> 00:13:48,369
so we're scanning
all ships and cargo

249
00:13:48,408 --> 00:13:50,072
before they leave the system.

250
00:13:50,113 --> 00:13:51,548
None of my cargo
came from Bajor.

251
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,919
I'm afraid the rules are
very strict, no exceptions.

252
00:13:53,956 --> 00:13:55,050
How long will this take?

253
00:13:55,092 --> 00:13:56,061
Six hours.

254
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,064
Six hours?

255
00:13:57,097 --> 00:13:58,532
We'll miss the rendezvous.

256
00:13:58,568 --> 00:14:00,266
We'll see about that.

257
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,520
Kasidy?

258
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:07,922
I'm sorry to bother you, Ben.

259
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:09,657
Normally, I wouldn't
do this, but...

260
00:14:09,696 --> 00:14:10,926
What is it?

261
00:14:10,966 --> 00:14:12,196
It's this health inspection.

262
00:14:12,236 --> 00:14:13,569
They're telling me it's going

263
00:14:13,607 --> 00:14:16,239
to take six hours,
but I need to make a rendezvous

264
00:14:16,281 --> 00:14:18,081
with a Tholian freighter
in nine hours

265
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:19,349
and you know how they are

266
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:20,380
about punctuality.

267
00:14:20,424 --> 00:14:22,588
If it weren't
for the health concern, maybe

268
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,621
but in this case...

269
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:24,636
Ben, please.

270
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:26,971
I promise to flood
the entire cargo hold

271
00:14:27,008 --> 00:14:29,207
with baryon radiation
as a precaution

272
00:14:29,248 --> 00:14:31,048
but I need to go now,
or I'll lose

273
00:14:31,086 --> 00:14:33,992
the entire consignment.

274
00:14:34,026 --> 00:14:35,724
Stand by.

275
00:14:37,201 --> 00:14:40,699
Is there any way we can make
a shorter inspection?

276
00:14:40,744 --> 00:14:42,647
Not if they're going to search
for contraband

277
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:44,778
while they make it look
like a health inspection.

278
00:14:44,821 --> 00:14:47,350
They need time to look
for camouflage fields

279
00:14:47,395 --> 00:14:50,095
false cargo manifests,
computer records.

280
00:14:50,135 --> 00:14:53,405
We probably shouldn't bother
at this point.

281
00:14:53,443 --> 00:14:55,107
If Kasidy's in a hurry

282
00:14:55,148 --> 00:14:57,586
she'll be standing over
their shoulders the whole time.

283
00:14:57,621 --> 00:15:00,150
They won't be able
to make much of a search.

284
00:15:00,195 --> 00:15:03,101
Captain, I strongly recommend
that we at least try.

285
00:15:09,184 --> 00:15:11,884
You are clear to leave
the station... just remember

286
00:15:11,925 --> 00:15:14,021
to irradiate that cargo.

287
00:15:14,064 --> 00:15:15,363
Thanks, Ben.
I owe you one.

288
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,391
See you tomorrow.

289
00:15:21,516 --> 00:15:23,818
Do you have something
to say, Commander?

290
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:24,822
No, sir.

291
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:25,824
Good.

292
00:15:25,894 --> 00:15:27,261
Now get down to the <i>Defiant</i>

293
00:15:27,298 --> 00:15:29,360
and tell Worf he has
a change of orders.

294
00:15:30,674 --> 00:15:33,169
I want you to follow the <i>Xhosa.</i>

295
00:15:33,214 --> 00:15:34,581
Aye, sir.

296
00:15:34,617 --> 00:15:35,711
What are our orders

297
00:15:35,754 --> 00:15:37,918
if we observe Captain Yates
meeting a Maquis ship?

298
00:15:39,764 --> 00:15:42,293
Right now, your orders
are to observe

299
00:15:42,337 --> 00:15:44,240
then report directly to me.

300
00:15:44,275 --> 00:15:45,676
Is that clear?

301
00:15:45,713 --> 00:15:46,909
Perfectly.

302
00:16:00,785 --> 00:16:02,688
The <i>Xhosa's</i> altering course,
Commander.

303
00:16:02,724 --> 00:16:06,861
Now on heading 158 mark 325.

304
00:16:06,901 --> 00:16:08,302
The Badlands.

305
00:16:08,338 --> 00:16:09,637
Stay with her, Chief.

306
00:16:09,675 --> 00:16:10,666
Aye, sir.

307
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,916
Say what you will
about the Maquis

308
00:16:30,028 --> 00:16:31,361
they're not stupid.

309
00:16:31,398 --> 00:16:33,562
Using the Badlands
as their base of operations

310
00:16:33,603 --> 00:16:34,765
was a pretty smart move.

311
00:16:34,807 --> 00:16:36,402
Not to mention a gutsy one.

312
00:16:36,445 --> 00:16:39,943
They are terrorists...
little more than criminals.

313
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,515
And criminals
always make mistakes.

314
00:16:42,561 --> 00:16:44,532
They're just fighting
for something they believe in.

315
00:16:45,501 --> 00:16:47,769
They should be hunted down
and destroyed.

316
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:48,776
What for?

317
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,336
Defending their homes?

318
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,253
Look at what's happened
to those people...

319
00:16:53,288 --> 00:16:55,556
one day,
they're eking out a living

320
00:16:55,594 --> 00:16:58,534
in some godforsaken colonies
on the Cardassian border.

321
00:16:58,568 --> 00:17:01,132
The next day,
the Federation makes a treaty

322
00:17:01,175 --> 00:17:03,807
handing those colonies over
to the Cardassians.

323
00:17:03,849 --> 00:17:05,148
What would you do?

324
00:17:05,186 --> 00:17:07,454
I would not become a terrorist.

325
00:17:07,491 --> 00:17:09,086
It would be dishonorable.

326
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:12,730
I wouldn't say that
around Major Kira if I were you.

327
00:17:14,577 --> 00:17:16,411
How about you, Commander?

328
00:17:16,448 --> 00:17:18,886
How do you feel
about the Maquis?

329
00:17:18,922 --> 00:17:22,625
I don't have any feelings
about them one way or the other.

330
00:17:22,665 --> 00:17:24,295
Oh, but you must have
an opinion.

331
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:25,827
I do my job, Chief.

332
00:17:25,873 --> 00:17:28,003
Starfleet says to find the
Maquis, I'll find the Maquis.

333
00:17:28,045 --> 00:17:29,640
They tell me to help them,
I'll help them.

334
00:17:29,683 --> 00:17:31,175
My opinion is irrelevant.

335
00:17:31,219 --> 00:17:35,127
What matters to me is doing
my job like a Starfleet Officer.

336
00:17:35,164 --> 00:17:38,662
Anything else...
is an indulgence.

337
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,981
I think I've got something.

338
00:17:43,017 --> 00:17:46,481
An impulse signature
off the starboard bow.

339
00:17:46,526 --> 00:17:48,964
Bring us within visual range.

340
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,162
Aye, sir.

341
00:17:55,383 --> 00:17:57,479
That's a Maquis raider.

342
00:17:59,292 --> 00:18:01,992
And the <i>Xhosa's</i> beaming
over her cargo.

343
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:19,802
- Hello.
- Hello.

344
00:18:19,846 --> 00:18:22,080
This is your shop.

345
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:24,283
Yes.

346
00:18:25,661 --> 00:18:27,632
It's very nice.

347
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,101
Thank you.

348
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:32,406
You do good work.

349
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,940
How kind.

350
00:18:39,263 --> 00:18:42,065
Is there something
I can do for you?

351
00:18:44,543 --> 00:18:47,915
I got this holosuite program
from Quark.

352
00:18:47,952 --> 00:18:51,519
It's a reproduction
of a Cardassian sauna.

353
00:18:51,562 --> 00:18:54,593
Like the ones
they have back home.

354
00:18:54,637 --> 00:18:56,836
Yes.

355
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,404
I was wondering if you...

356
00:18:59,448 --> 00:19:02,286
might be interested
in trying it out with me.

357
00:19:02,323 --> 00:19:04,021
Oh.

358
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:07,126
I mean, we're the only
Cardassians on the station

359
00:19:07,236 --> 00:19:11,144
and, well, the temperature's
too hot for almost anyone else.

360
00:19:11,213 --> 00:19:13,811
I see.

361
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:16,827
When were you thinking of?

362
00:19:16,861 --> 00:19:18,991
Maybe the day after tomorrow.

363
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,524
Say 2100?

364
00:19:23,511 --> 00:19:25,813
I'd be delighted.

365
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:28,322
Great.

366
00:19:28,357 --> 00:19:30,328
I'll see you there.

367
00:19:30,363 --> 00:19:32,562
I look forward to it.

368
00:19:47,407 --> 00:19:50,745
- Morning.
- Morning.

369
00:19:50,782 --> 00:19:53,118
<i>Raktajino,</i> extra sweet.

370
00:19:53,155 --> 00:19:54,887
Makapa bread, no crust.

371
00:19:54,926 --> 00:19:57,558
What happened
to juice and oatmeal?

372
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:00,265
Kasidy introduced me to this.

373
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,277
It's great.

374
00:20:02,346 --> 00:20:04,283
When's she due back?

375
00:20:04,351 --> 00:20:05,650
Tonight.

376
00:20:08,981 --> 00:20:09,950
Oh, don't worry.

377
00:20:09,984 --> 00:20:11,419
It's supposed to do that.

378
00:20:11,454 --> 00:20:14,952
The foam tastes like a...
a weird peppermint

379
00:20:15,031 --> 00:20:17,161
and the bread...

380
00:20:17,203 --> 00:20:19,767
I don't know
what it tastes like.

381
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,610
You want some?

382
00:20:21,648 --> 00:20:23,847
I think I'll pass.

383
00:20:23,887 --> 00:20:26,861
Dad, is something wrong?

384
00:20:26,895 --> 00:20:28,957
I'm a little tired.

385
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,974
Didn't get much
sleep last night.

386
00:20:34,214 --> 00:20:37,016
I guess you're not used
to sleeping alone anymore.

387
00:20:37,121 --> 00:20:39,457
What I mean is

388
00:20:39,494 --> 00:20:42,228
you miss her companionship...

389
00:20:42,268 --> 00:20:44,832
you miss talking

390
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:47,609
and sharing insights
about command and duty...

391
00:20:47,649 --> 00:20:48,777
All right, that's enough.

392
00:20:48,818 --> 00:20:51,052
I was just kidding.

393
00:20:51,091 --> 00:20:53,393
I know.

394
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:57,669
I've just got a lot on my mind.

395
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:00,648
Something happen
between you and Kasidy?

396
00:21:00,683 --> 00:21:02,677
Not exactly.

397
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,429
If you want to talk...

398
00:21:10,608 --> 00:21:12,602
What?

399
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,250
This is important.

400
00:21:17,292 --> 00:21:19,422
You and I.

401
00:21:19,465 --> 00:21:21,937
Things change...

402
00:21:21,971 --> 00:21:24,911
but... not this.

403
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:29,925
Forget it.

404
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:31,258
I'm just having a bad day.

405
00:21:39,884 --> 00:21:42,949
After the cargo was beamed
aboard the Maquis raider

406
00:21:42,992 --> 00:21:45,122
the <i>Xhosa</i> took this route
out of the Badlands

407
00:21:45,231 --> 00:21:48,103
and resumed its course
to Dreon VII.

408
00:21:48,139 --> 00:21:50,373
Do you know what cargo was
transferred to the Maquis ship?

409
00:21:50,411 --> 00:21:52,382
From the residual
transporter signature

410
00:21:52,417 --> 00:21:54,685
it was approximately
80 percent organic.

411
00:21:54,722 --> 00:21:57,024
I'd say food
or possibly medical supplies.

412
00:21:57,062 --> 00:21:58,930
Well, at least we're not dealing
with weapons.

413
00:21:58,967 --> 00:22:00,527
It sounds
like she's only providing...

414
00:22:00,572 --> 00:22:02,406
Where is the <i>Xhosa</i> now?

415
00:22:02,443 --> 00:22:05,109
Captain Yates is on her
way back to the station.

416
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,178
She should arrive at 1900 hours.

417
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,124
Thank you.
Dismissed.

418
00:22:23,297 --> 00:22:24,425
Dismissed, old man.

419
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,407
Come in.

420
00:22:54,812 --> 00:22:56,806
Miss me?

421
00:22:57,953 --> 00:22:59,924
Were you gone?

422
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:03,991
Admit it... without me,
you cried yourself to sleep.

423
00:23:07,946 --> 00:23:11,911
So, did you make your rendezvous
with the Tholian freighter?

424
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:13,655
Right on time, and thank you

425
00:23:13,694 --> 00:23:15,928
for bending
the inspection rules for me.

426
00:23:15,967 --> 00:23:17,995
We'd never have made it
without you.

427
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:20,511
Just don't make a habit of it.

428
00:23:20,545 --> 00:23:22,516
I promise.

429
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:25,216
Where did you meet
the Tholians anyway?

430
00:23:25,258 --> 00:23:26,659
In the Dreon system?

431
00:23:26,695 --> 00:23:27,994
Yeah. Why?

432
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:31,267
It just seemed odd
that they would travel that far

433
00:23:31,374 --> 00:23:33,402
just for some medical supplies.

434
00:23:33,446 --> 00:23:34,881
They really needed them.

435
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:37,252
They've got some kind
of viral infection

436
00:23:37,289 --> 00:23:38,758
on one of their colonies.

437
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,284
In fact, I can't stay long...

438
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:42,301
I'm supposed
to make a run tonight.

439
00:23:42,369 --> 00:23:45,537
But I promise you can inspect
the cargo ahead of time.

440
00:23:45,577 --> 00:23:47,845
That'll make Odo very happy.

441
00:23:50,423 --> 00:23:51,892
Hey, you're back.

442
00:23:51,926 --> 00:23:53,327
Looks like it to me.

443
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:55,665
Are you guys doing
anything right now?

444
00:23:55,703 --> 00:23:58,939
I just got a new holosuite
program that Nog sent me.

445
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:01,817
It's a baseball game
between the 1961 Yankees

446
00:24:01,852 --> 00:24:03,151
and the 1978 Red Sox.

447
00:24:03,189 --> 00:24:05,160
I'll buy the hot dogs.

448
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:06,391
I'll have to pass.

449
00:24:06,432 --> 00:24:08,164
I have to get back to Ops.

450
00:24:08,202 --> 00:24:10,470
Anyway, the Yankees
will bury them.

451
00:24:10,508 --> 00:24:11,670
You two have fun.

452
00:24:11,711 --> 00:24:14,013
But I'm only here
for a few hours.

453
00:24:14,051 --> 00:24:15,315
Duty calls.

454
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:17,256
I'll see when you get back.

455
00:24:19,131 --> 00:24:20,623
Okay.

456
00:24:27,285 --> 00:24:29,347
She's going
on another run tonight.

457
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:32,626
She seemed prepared
for a cargo inspection this time

458
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:34,569
so I doubt
you'll find anything.

459
00:24:34,605 --> 00:24:35,904
Captain...

460
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:38,881
Mr. Eddington and I
have discussed this at length

461
00:24:38,915 --> 00:24:40,909
and we both feel
that if the <i>Xhosa</i>

462
00:24:40,954 --> 00:24:43,722
makes another rendezvous
with a Maquis raider

463
00:24:43,761 --> 00:24:47,065
we should seize both vessels
and arrest everyone aboard.

464
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:49,804
For all we know, the <i>Xhosa</i> may
not make another run for months.

465
00:24:49,844 --> 00:24:52,841
We shouldn't let this
opportunity pass us by.

466
00:24:52,885 --> 00:24:54,286
Agreed.

467
00:24:54,322 --> 00:24:56,122
Yes, sir.

468
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:00,433
And that does bring up another
point I'd like to discuss...

469
00:25:00,505 --> 00:25:02,339
in private, if I may.

470
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:08,520
Sir, the CFI replicators

471
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,827
are due to arrive here
tomorrow afternoon.

472
00:25:10,865 --> 00:25:13,167
I'd feel better if I were
here to supervise

473
00:25:13,204 --> 00:25:14,264
the security detail.

474
00:25:14,307 --> 00:25:16,039
Lieutenant Reese can handle it.

475
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:17,777
Yes, sir, he can, but...

476
00:25:19,253 --> 00:25:20,722
Just say it, Commander.

477
00:25:21,793 --> 00:25:23,262
Sir, if the Maquis
put up a fight

478
00:25:23,297 --> 00:25:25,325
the <i>Xhosa</i> might get caught
in the cross fire.

479
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,862
If that happens,
I can't guarantee

480
00:25:26,906 --> 00:25:28,170
the safety of Kasidy Yates.

481
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:29,874
And to be blunt

482
00:25:29,914 --> 00:25:31,714
I don't want
that responsibility.

483
00:25:31,753 --> 00:25:33,724
I can't say I blame you.

484
00:25:33,758 --> 00:25:38,361
The security of the CFI
replicators is your priority.

485
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:41,070
I'll take command
of the <i>Defiant.</i>

486
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,774
Thank you, Captain.

487
00:25:53,443 --> 00:25:55,346
The inspection team just left.

488
00:25:55,381 --> 00:25:56,509
Any problems?

489
00:25:56,551 --> 00:25:57,520
No.

490
00:25:57,553 --> 00:25:59,148
Kasidy.

491
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:01,025
I'll be right there.

492
00:26:03,434 --> 00:26:05,564
How was the game?

493
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:06,906
Good.

494
00:26:06,944 --> 00:26:08,574
Seven-three, Yankees.

495
00:26:11,322 --> 00:26:14,490
Did you come all the way
down here for the score?

496
00:26:14,563 --> 00:26:16,500
No.

497
00:26:16,568 --> 00:26:18,505
I was just thinking...

498
00:26:18,608 --> 00:26:21,514
why don't we drop everything
and go to Risa?

499
00:26:21,616 --> 00:26:22,915
Just the two of us.

500
00:26:22,952 --> 00:26:23,921
Now?

501
00:26:23,954 --> 00:26:25,446
We won't even pack a bag.

502
00:26:25,492 --> 00:26:29,491
We'll walk straight out of here,
get in a runabout and go.

503
00:26:29,536 --> 00:26:31,370
What about your station?

504
00:26:31,407 --> 00:26:33,002
I have a great crew.

505
00:26:33,045 --> 00:26:37,044
They can handle things
around here for a few days.

506
00:26:40,631 --> 00:26:43,935
Neither of us is doing
anything so important

507
00:26:43,973 --> 00:26:47,311
that it can't wait
for a few days.

508
00:26:47,349 --> 00:26:50,551
I'm not sure
the Tholians would agree.

509
00:26:50,591 --> 00:26:53,063
Let your First Officer
handle it.

510
00:26:53,097 --> 00:26:55,831
Or better yet, tell the Tholians

511
00:26:55,871 --> 00:26:59,312
they won't be getting
this shipment at all.

512
00:26:59,347 --> 00:27:02,811
I don't think I can do that,
Ben.

513
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:06,285
I... I-I have a commitment
to fulfill.

514
00:27:10,731 --> 00:27:13,033
But if you want
to take a runabout

515
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:16,773
and wait for me on Risa,
I'll meet you there.

516
00:27:22,093 --> 00:27:24,064
Forget about it.

517
00:27:24,098 --> 00:27:27,402
It was just a crazy idea.

518
00:27:27,441 --> 00:27:30,438
Have a good trip.

519
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,716
Thanks.

520
00:27:41,477 --> 00:27:44,143
It was a tempting idea, Ben.

521
00:27:46,825 --> 00:27:49,423
I wish I could
take you up on it.

522
00:27:49,465 --> 00:27:52,439
So do I.

523
00:28:09,283 --> 00:28:10,843
They're reducing speed.

524
00:28:10,887 --> 00:28:12,915
Match their velocity, Chief.

525
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:14,393
These are the same coordinates

526
00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:16,024
they used
for the last rendezvous.

527
00:28:16,066 --> 00:28:18,800
Any sign of another ship?

528
00:28:18,841 --> 00:28:19,935
Not yet, but our sensors

529
00:28:20,044 --> 00:28:22,140
are extremely limited
in the plasma fields.

530
00:28:23,486 --> 00:28:25,650
They're turning again.

531
00:28:25,692 --> 00:28:27,960
Looks like a holding
pattern to me, sir.

532
00:28:28,065 --> 00:28:32,098
Either the Maquis are late
or the <i>Xhosa's</i> early.

533
00:28:32,142 --> 00:28:35,048
Either way, we wait with them.

534
00:28:36,888 --> 00:28:38,654
Can't you do something
about these lapels?

535
00:28:38,693 --> 00:28:39,787
Such as?

536
00:28:39,828 --> 00:28:41,229
I don't know.
I'm not a tailor.

537
00:28:41,266 --> 00:28:44,000
Just... make them look good.

538
00:28:44,073 --> 00:28:45,006
Oh, make them look good.

539
00:28:45,076 --> 00:28:46,204
And all this time

540
00:28:46,245 --> 00:28:48,011
I thought you wanted me to
try to make them look bad.

541
00:28:48,049 --> 00:28:49,382
I wish you'd said that before.

542
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,389
It's much simpler

543
00:28:50,422 --> 00:28:52,860
when the customer
explains what he wants.

544
00:28:52,895 --> 00:28:54,421
Rudeness will get you nowhere.

545
00:28:54,467 --> 00:28:55,766
I don't need another waiter.

546
00:28:55,803 --> 00:29:01,010
Now, I want more room
in the shoulders and these cuffs

547
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:02,349
are completely unacceptable.

548
00:29:02,387 --> 00:29:04,187
Garak, can I talk
to you for a minute?

549
00:29:04,225 --> 00:29:05,489
Of course, Major.

550
00:29:05,528 --> 00:29:07,192
Excuse me.

551
00:29:07,233 --> 00:29:09,033
Sure.

552
00:29:11,043 --> 00:29:13,105
Now, what can I do
for you, Major...

553
00:29:13,149 --> 00:29:14,675
Listen closely.

554
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,383
I don't know what kind
of sick game it is

555
00:29:16,424 --> 00:29:17,484
you're playing with Ziyal

556
00:29:17,527 --> 00:29:19,498
but it better stop and it
better stop right now.

557
00:29:19,532 --> 00:29:20,694
I can assure you, Major, l...

558
00:29:20,735 --> 00:29:22,934
I don't want to hear
any of your lies.

559
00:29:22,973 --> 00:29:25,343
Now, that girl is here
under my protection

560
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:28,479
and I swear, if you do
anything to hurt her

561
00:29:28,521 --> 00:29:29,854
I will make you regret it.

562
00:29:29,891 --> 00:29:30,882
Is that clear?

563
00:29:30,928 --> 00:29:33,264
As Tabalian glass.

564
00:29:33,301 --> 00:29:34,861
Good.

565
00:29:41,121 --> 00:29:42,921
You told her.

566
00:29:42,959 --> 00:29:46,731
The pants are
about a meter too long.

567
00:29:49,342 --> 00:29:53,341
So, are you canceling
your date with Ziyal?

568
00:29:54,489 --> 00:29:56,460
It's not a date.

569
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:58,362
And how do you know about that?

570
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,601
You're a man, she's a woman,
it's a date.

571
00:30:01,641 --> 00:30:04,045
And they are my holosuites,
after all.

572
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,893
I was going to cancel.

573
00:30:09,929 --> 00:30:12,424
I'd had visions of Ziyal
presenting my head

574
00:30:12,468 --> 00:30:14,268
to her father
as a birthday gift.

575
00:30:14,307 --> 00:30:16,779
That's a little paranoid,
wouldn't you say?

576
00:30:16,813 --> 00:30:18,305
Paranoid is what
they call people

577
00:30:18,351 --> 00:30:20,550
who imagine threats
against their life.

578
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:23,188
I have threats against my life.

579
00:30:23,264 --> 00:30:27,206
But after my little "chat"
with Major Kira

580
00:30:27,307 --> 00:30:29,541
I feel much better.

581
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,571
You do?

582
00:30:30,616 --> 00:30:31,915
Isn't it obvious?

583
00:30:31,952 --> 00:30:33,421
If Ziyal planned to kill me

584
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:35,725
Kira would not be trying
to warn me away.

585
00:30:35,763 --> 00:30:37,062
On the contrary

586
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,664
the good Major
would also welcome

587
00:30:39,706 --> 00:30:42,976
my untimely demise
and do nothing to interfere.

588
00:30:43,015 --> 00:30:44,815
Unless that's part of the plan.

589
00:30:44,853 --> 00:30:46,186
What do you mean?

590
00:30:46,223 --> 00:30:50,188
Oh, you know, Kira acts like
she doesn't want you to go

591
00:30:50,234 --> 00:30:52,798
so you'll feel everything's okay

592
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,176
and then you go anyway.

593
00:30:56,617 --> 00:30:59,021
No, it's too complicated.

594
00:31:00,593 --> 00:31:03,122
Of course.

595
00:31:03,167 --> 00:31:05,833
Now they're too short.

596
00:31:05,874 --> 00:31:07,241
What?

597
00:31:07,311 --> 00:31:08,507
The pants.

598
00:31:08,548 --> 00:31:10,108
Oh.

599
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:27,061
This is wrong.

600
00:31:27,096 --> 00:31:29,067
Terrorists don't work this way.

601
00:31:29,101 --> 00:31:32,736
If your contact doesn't show up
for a rendezvous, you leave.

602
00:31:32,778 --> 00:31:37,222
You don't stay in the Badlands
going in circles for five hours.

603
00:31:37,256 --> 00:31:38,589
Perhaps.

604
00:31:38,626 --> 00:31:39,720
But it is also possible

605
00:31:39,762 --> 00:31:41,858
that her cargo
is so valuable to the Maquis

606
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:42,870
that she will wait

607
00:31:42,904 --> 00:31:44,898
as long as it takes
to make her delivery.

608
00:31:46,379 --> 00:31:48,874
I think she's already
made her delivery.

609
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:50,913
And you were the cargo.

610
00:31:50,958 --> 00:31:53,328
Think about it...
if anyone

611
00:31:53,363 --> 00:31:54,832
but Kasidy Yates
was on the <i>Xhosa</i>

612
00:31:54,868 --> 00:31:56,964
would you be commanding
this mission yourself?

613
00:31:57,006 --> 00:31:59,342
You're saying someone
wanted me here? Why?

614
00:31:59,379 --> 00:32:00,780
I'm not sure.

615
00:32:00,816 --> 00:32:02,046
But one thing's certain,
we're not going

616
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,989
to find the answers sitting here
staring at the viewscreen.

617
00:32:04,025 --> 00:32:05,893
You're right.

618
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:07,924
The answers are over there.

619
00:32:07,969 --> 00:32:09,268
Let's go.

620
00:32:09,305 --> 00:32:11,173
Mr. Worf, you have the Bridge.

621
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:23,501
Still nothing.

622
00:32:23,543 --> 00:32:25,673
This is getting ridiculous.

623
00:32:25,714 --> 00:32:27,274
All right, let's send
a coded message...

624
00:32:28,722 --> 00:32:30,282
Tachyon surge.

625
00:32:30,327 --> 00:32:32,264
A ship's de-cloaking.

626
00:32:33,267 --> 00:32:36,241
Oh, my God.

627
00:32:40,152 --> 00:32:41,121
Ben.

628
00:32:41,155 --> 00:32:42,921
What are you doing here?
We've been...

629
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,986
Don't say it!

630
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:45,658
I know that you're a smuggler.

631
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,864
I know that you've been
working with the Maquis

632
00:32:47,906 --> 00:32:49,877
and right now, I don't care.

633
00:32:49,911 --> 00:32:52,179
But I need to know
what your orders were.

634
00:32:52,217 --> 00:32:54,655
Were you told to draw me
out here so the Maquis

635
00:32:54,689 --> 00:32:56,660
could attack the station?
Ben, l...

636
00:32:56,695 --> 00:32:58,028
Jake's back there.

637
00:32:58,065 --> 00:32:59,695
And whatever your
feelings are for me

638
00:32:59,737 --> 00:33:01,731
I can't believe you
would put him in danger.

639
00:33:01,775 --> 00:33:06,550
I was supposed to meet a Maquis
ship at these coordinates.

640
00:33:06,587 --> 00:33:09,355
I don't know anything
about an attack on the station.

641
00:33:09,395 --> 00:33:11,559
And I doubt the Maquis
would try.

642
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,662
I didn't know
you were following me

643
00:33:13,706 --> 00:33:15,141
but, after our last talk

644
00:33:15,176 --> 00:33:18,014
I suspected
that you might be out there.

645
00:33:18,051 --> 00:33:21,116
If that's true, why didn't you
abort the mission?

646
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:23,791
I was told that these
medical supplies

647
00:33:23,832 --> 00:33:25,062
were urgently needed.

648
00:33:25,102 --> 00:33:27,472
And that I had to be here
no matter what.

649
00:33:27,542 --> 00:33:29,172
I tried to tell them
that I'd made

650
00:33:29,213 --> 00:33:31,013
too many runs
in the last few days...

651
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:33,615
that I was just asking
to get caught

652
00:33:33,658 --> 00:33:35,754
but they wouldn't listen.

653
00:33:35,796 --> 00:33:38,166
They knew you were
going to be caught.

654
00:33:38,203 --> 00:33:41,041
That's why they didn't
send a Maquis ship

655
00:33:41,077 --> 00:33:42,512
out here to meet you.

656
00:33:42,614 --> 00:33:45,850
Everything's been
building to this.

657
00:33:45,889 --> 00:33:48,123
They needed to draw me
away from the station.

658
00:33:48,162 --> 00:33:49,222
Why?

659
00:33:49,265 --> 00:33:50,666
If they aren't planning
an attack

660
00:33:50,702 --> 00:33:52,137
what other reason
could there be?

661
00:33:52,172 --> 00:33:53,802
What could be happening?

662
00:33:53,843 --> 00:33:57,683
Happening on the station.

663
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,224
I've received new orders
from Starfleet Command.

664
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,459
The CFI replicators
in Cargo Bay 17

665
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:04,493
are to be transferred
aboard a Vulcan freighter

666
00:34:04,538 --> 00:34:06,270
which should arrive
at any moment.

667
00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:09,306
This operation is to be
carried out in complete secrecy.

668
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:11,446
No one aboard the station
is to know about it.

669
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:14,520
Does that include the Bajoran
security detachment, sir?

670
00:34:14,564 --> 00:34:15,533
Absolutely.

671
00:34:15,567 --> 00:34:16,729
Also, as of this moment

672
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:18,741
we're observing
communications silence.

673
00:34:18,775 --> 00:34:21,043
No com traffic in or out
of the station

674
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,744
for the next nine hours.
Understood?

675
00:34:22,785 --> 00:34:23,754
Aye, sir.

676
00:34:23,788 --> 00:34:24,779
Dismissed.

677
00:34:38,526 --> 00:34:39,487
You wanted to see me?

678
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,485
Yes, Major.

679
00:34:40,523 --> 00:34:41,924
I'm afraid I need
to take command

680
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,658
of the station
for the next few hours.

681
00:35:09,798 --> 00:35:11,701
We've cleared
the plasma field, Captain.

682
00:35:11,737 --> 00:35:13,435
Get us back to the station,
Chief.

683
00:35:13,475 --> 00:35:14,444
Maximum warp.

684
00:35:14,478 --> 00:35:15,469
Aye, sir.

685
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:16,982
Any response from our hails,
Commander?

686
00:35:17,018 --> 00:35:17,987
No, sir.

687
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,353
Deep Space 9 seems to be

688
00:35:19,391 --> 00:35:21,157
under
a communications blackout.

689
00:35:21,194 --> 00:35:22,595
Keep trying.

690
00:35:22,632 --> 00:35:25,036
You realize
we'll probably never see

691
00:35:25,072 --> 00:35:27,306
the <i>Xhosa</i>
or Captain Yates again.

692
00:35:27,344 --> 00:35:28,313
It's a possibility.

693
00:35:28,347 --> 00:35:29,441
I'd say it's more than that.

694
00:35:29,483 --> 00:35:30,452
If I'd been allowed

695
00:35:30,485 --> 00:35:32,183
to leave a security detail
behind...

696
00:35:32,223 --> 00:35:33,283
Our priority is

697
00:35:33,326 --> 00:35:35,024
to get back to the station,
Constable.

698
00:35:35,065 --> 00:35:37,503
Captain Yates is
my responsibility

699
00:35:37,538 --> 00:35:39,874
and I'll thank you
to leave it at that.

700
00:35:39,976 --> 00:35:42,072
As you wish.

701
00:35:56,286 --> 00:35:57,881
The replicators
have been secured

702
00:35:57,923 --> 00:35:59,153
in the ship's hold, sir.

703
00:35:59,193 --> 00:36:00,162
Very good.

704
00:36:00,196 --> 00:36:01,791
We'll be departing
in five minutes

705
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:04,671
and I'm leaving you in command
until Captain Sisko returns.

706
00:36:04,708 --> 00:36:05,870
Me, sir?

707
00:36:05,978 --> 00:36:07,538
You have a problem
with that, Lieutenant?

708
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:08,778
No, sir.

709
00:36:08,819 --> 00:36:10,483
It's just that's it's unusual

710
00:36:10,523 --> 00:36:12,494
for a junior officer
to be left...

711
00:36:12,528 --> 00:36:15,262
If you're not up to the job,
I'll find someone else who is.

712
00:36:15,302 --> 00:36:17,000
The safety of this station
may depend on you

713
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,635
and I need to know
if you can handle it.

714
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:20,705
You can count on me, Commander.

715
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:21,719
Good.

716
00:36:21,752 --> 00:36:23,723
Now go to Ops and take command.

717
00:36:23,757 --> 00:36:25,625
Yes, sir.

718
00:36:40,534 --> 00:36:41,935
Captain's Log, supplemental.

719
00:36:41,972 --> 00:36:43,943
The <i>Defiant</i> has returned
to the station

720
00:36:43,977 --> 00:36:45,880
but it seems
that Commander Eddington

721
00:36:45,915 --> 00:36:47,441
is still one step ahead of us.

722
00:36:47,485 --> 00:36:49,388
All Federation starships
near the Badlands

723
00:36:49,423 --> 00:36:51,223
have been alerted to look
for the Vulcan freighter.

724
00:36:51,262 --> 00:36:52,288
I doubt they'll find it.

725
00:36:52,331 --> 00:36:54,929
Eddington anticipated
every contingency.

726
00:36:54,971 --> 00:36:57,671
I'm sure he had
his escape route well planned.

727
00:36:57,712 --> 00:36:59,238
What do we tell the Cardassians?

728
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:00,252
The truth.

729
00:37:00,286 --> 00:37:02,758
He fooled me,
and he got away with it.

730
00:37:02,792 --> 00:37:03,954
He fooled all of us.

731
00:37:04,029 --> 00:37:06,467
Everything that happens
on this station

732
00:37:06,502 --> 00:37:08,302
is my responsibility,
Major.

733
00:37:09,944 --> 00:37:12,416
Incoming message
for you, Captain.

734
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:14,580
It's from Commander Eddington.

735
00:37:14,623 --> 00:37:16,925
Put it through, in my office.

736
00:37:22,042 --> 00:37:23,102
Captain.

737
00:37:23,144 --> 00:37:26,414
Mr. Eddington,
I have just one question.

738
00:37:26,454 --> 00:37:27,514
Why?

739
00:37:27,556 --> 00:37:29,390
Will knowing
my personal motivation

740
00:37:29,427 --> 00:37:31,022
change anything at this point?

741
00:37:31,065 --> 00:37:32,557
No, I don't suppose it will.

742
00:37:32,602 --> 00:37:34,801
Then let's table that for now.

743
00:37:34,842 --> 00:37:37,144
The only reason
I've contacted you

744
00:37:37,181 --> 00:37:39,585
is to ask you
to leave us alone.

745
00:37:39,621 --> 00:37:42,150
Our quarrel is
with the Cardassians

746
00:37:42,194 --> 00:37:43,527
not the Federation.

747
00:37:43,564 --> 00:37:46,002
Leave us alone,
and I can promise you

748
00:37:46,038 --> 00:37:47,770
you'll never hear
from the Maquis again.

749
00:37:47,809 --> 00:37:50,874
Unless you see another shipment
you want to hijack.

750
00:37:50,917 --> 00:37:54,289
You keep sending replicators
to Cardassia, and you're going

751
00:37:54,325 --> 00:37:56,854
to have a lot more
to worry about than hijackings.

752
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:58,665
I don't respond well to threats.

753
00:37:58,703 --> 00:38:00,367
I thought you
would know that by now

754
00:38:00,408 --> 00:38:03,040
but I'm beginning to see
that you don't know me at all.

755
00:38:03,082 --> 00:38:04,278
I know you.

756
00:38:04,318 --> 00:38:07,953
I was like you once,
but then I opened my eyes.

757
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,296
Open your eyes, Captain.

758
00:38:10,334 --> 00:38:12,602
Why is the Federation
so obsessed with the Maquis?

759
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:16,980
We've never harmed you, and yet
we're constantly arrested

760
00:38:17,017 --> 00:38:18,577
and charged with terrorism.

761
00:38:18,622 --> 00:38:21,094
Starships chase us
through the Badlands

762
00:38:21,195 --> 00:38:24,693
and our supporters are harassed
and ridiculed. Why?

763
00:38:24,738 --> 00:38:26,675
Because we've left
the Federation

764
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:29,548
and that's the one thing
you can't accept.

765
00:38:29,583 --> 00:38:31,987
Nobody leaves paradise.

766
00:38:32,023 --> 00:38:34,393
Everyone should want
to be in the Federation.

767
00:38:34,429 --> 00:38:36,799
Hell, you even want
the Cardassians to join.

768
00:38:36,836 --> 00:38:38,135
You're only sending them
replicators

769
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:40,871
because one day they can take
their rightful place

770
00:38:40,914 --> 00:38:42,612
on the Federation Council.

771
00:38:42,651 --> 00:38:47,152
You know, in some ways,
you're even worse than the Borg.

772
00:38:47,263 --> 00:38:50,567
At least they tell you about
their plans for assimilation.

773
00:38:50,605 --> 00:38:52,804
You're more insidious.

774
00:38:52,844 --> 00:38:56,650
You assimilate people,
and they don't even know it.

775
00:38:58,391 --> 00:39:00,453
You know what, Mr. Eddington?

776
00:39:00,497 --> 00:39:02,365
I don't give a damn
what you think

777
00:39:02,402 --> 00:39:05,136
of the Federation,
the Maquis, or anything else.

778
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:09,084
All I know is that you betrayed
your oath, your duty and me.

779
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,854
And if it takes me
the rest of my life

780
00:39:11,893 --> 00:39:14,263
I will see you standing
before a court-martial

781
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:17,274
that'll break you
and send you to a penal colony

782
00:39:17,308 --> 00:39:20,180
where you will spend the rest
of your days growing old

783
00:39:20,248 --> 00:39:22,743
and wondering whether
a ship full of replicators

784
00:39:22,788 --> 00:39:25,317
was really worth it.

785
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,222
Garak?

786
00:39:38,329 --> 00:39:39,593
Hello.

787
00:39:39,632 --> 00:39:41,398
Doesn't it feel good?

788
00:39:41,437 --> 00:39:43,932
The station can be
so chilly sometimes.

789
00:39:43,976 --> 00:39:45,172
Yes.

790
00:39:45,213 --> 00:39:48,187
It's quite pleasant.

791
00:39:48,221 --> 00:39:49,885
Aren't you going to lie down?

792
00:39:49,926 --> 00:39:51,156
Uh, not just yet.

793
00:39:51,196 --> 00:39:55,263
I have a question
I'd like answered first.

794
00:39:55,306 --> 00:39:56,707
Why am I here?

795
00:39:56,744 --> 00:39:58,270
Excuse me?

796
00:39:58,314 --> 00:39:59,909
Why am I here?

797
00:39:59,952 --> 00:40:03,724
Am I to believe
that you've invited

798
00:40:03,762 --> 00:40:05,562
the sworn enemy of your father

799
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,870
simply to enjoy the heat?

800
00:40:11,013 --> 00:40:14,419
You really think
I asked you here to kill you.

801
00:40:15,592 --> 00:40:17,928
Well, it did occur to me.

802
00:40:17,965 --> 00:40:21,998
Kira and my father both told me
that you used to be an agent

803
00:40:22,042 --> 00:40:23,511
of the Obsidian Order.

804
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:24,515
Oh.

805
00:40:24,549 --> 00:40:26,543
That you had
my grandfather tortured

806
00:40:26,587 --> 00:40:29,355
and killed, and that you
could easily kill me

807
00:40:29,395 --> 00:40:30,990
without a second thought.

808
00:40:31,032 --> 00:40:34,633
Although I seldom credit
the Major or your father

809
00:40:34,675 --> 00:40:36,874
with being entirely trustworthy

810
00:40:36,914 --> 00:40:42,327
in this case,
they're both telling the truth.

811
00:40:42,362 --> 00:40:45,028
You know what else is true?

812
00:40:45,069 --> 00:40:47,063
I don't care.

813
00:40:47,107 --> 00:40:50,947
I'm half-Bajoran, and that means
I'm an outcast back home.

814
00:40:50,984 --> 00:40:54,152
I can't go back
and neither can you.

815
00:40:54,192 --> 00:40:56,994
So, we can either
share some time together

816
00:40:57,033 --> 00:40:59,301
or we can ignore each other.

817
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:02,974
I spent five years in a
prisoner of war camp by myself.

818
00:41:03,016 --> 00:41:05,078
I don't need your company

819
00:41:05,121 --> 00:41:11,035
but if you'd like to stay
and share the heat with me

820
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:15,308
maybe tell me something
about home that I don't know

821
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:18,549
then I would welcome
your company

822
00:41:18,589 --> 00:41:22,326
and I get the feeling
you would welcome mine.

823
00:41:22,365 --> 00:41:25,829
Either way, it's up to you.

824
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:37,802
Well... it seems I won't
be needing this anymore.

825
00:41:54,286 --> 00:41:56,416
So...

826
00:41:56,459 --> 00:41:58,863
what shall we talk about first?

827
00:42:15,742 --> 00:42:16,904
Just you?

828
00:42:16,979 --> 00:42:19,919
I dropped my crew off
at a Maquis base.

829
00:42:19,952 --> 00:42:23,324
I had to come back,
but I didn't see any reason

830
00:42:23,362 --> 00:42:26,359
to drag them here
just to face a prison sentence.

831
00:42:26,403 --> 00:42:28,898
You didn't have
to come back either.

832
00:42:28,943 --> 00:42:32,407
Yes. I did.

833
00:42:32,451 --> 00:42:34,251
And I think we both know

834
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:37,287
that's why you left us
alone out there...

835
00:42:37,331 --> 00:42:40,396
to see if I would.

836
00:42:41,876 --> 00:42:45,979
I'm not going to stand here
and apologize for what I did.

837
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:48,458
You had your duty.

838
00:42:48,493 --> 00:42:50,692
I had mine.

839
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:54,474
I still have my duty.

840
00:42:55,511 --> 00:42:57,847
I know.

841
00:42:57,885 --> 00:43:01,223
And I know
I'll probably go to prison.

842
00:43:03,499 --> 00:43:07,373
But I came back because of us.

843
00:43:07,409 --> 00:43:10,474
Because despite
all that's happened

844
00:43:10,517 --> 00:43:13,251
I still love you, Ben.

845
00:43:15,865 --> 00:43:17,927
I don't want to throw that away.

846
00:43:19,675 --> 00:43:20,871
Do you?

847
00:43:23,551 --> 00:43:25,111
No.

848
00:43:53,596 --> 00:43:55,692
Lieutenant Reese.

849
00:44:02,118 --> 00:44:05,058
I'll be back.

850
00:44:05,125 --> 00:44:07,153
I'll be here.
