1
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:12,095
(<i> sighs</i> )

2
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:15,265
How long was I asleep?
Almost two hours.

3
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:19,227
You dropped out of warp.
Must be close to home.

4
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:22,272
We entered the Bajoran system
a few minutes ago.

5
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,274
What's that?

6
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:28,195
The shopkeeper I bought it from
called it a "knickknack."

7
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:32,240
I didn't know
you collected knickknacks.

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,785
It's a present
for Kira.

9
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:36,704
Oh...

10
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:39,289
You, you don't think
she'll like it?

11
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:42,334
Oh, I'm sure she'll like it.

12
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:44,962
It's just that I didn't get
anything for Keiko.

13
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:46,922
Ah.

14
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:49,842
Well, the conference kept
you pretty busy.

15
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:51,593
Well, you found time
to get something.

16
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:57,766
Not chocolates as well.

17
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:01,395
Hmm. Rigelian chocolates--
her favorite.

18
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:02,771
I'll buy them from you.

19
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,481
I beg your pardon?

20
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,191
I'll buy them from you.

21
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,860
Come on, Odo.

22
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,319
You don't have to give her
two presents.

23
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,988
You've only been gone a day.

24
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:13,657
I'm sorry, Miles,
but the answer is no.

25
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:16,660
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

26
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:19,997
There's something behind us.

27
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,499
It's gaining on us fast.

28
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:38,640
You think it's friendly?

29
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,851
I hope so.

30
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:43,520
It's certainly taken
an interest in us.

31
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,983
Uh-oh.

32
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:49,818
It's gone.

33
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,570
What?
According
to the sensors

34
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,238
there's nothing out there.

35
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,865
Well, where'd it go?

36
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,324
(<i> deep rumbling</i> )

37
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:06,167
(<i> thumping</i> )

38
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:16,303
(<i> rumbling and thumping</i>
<i>continue</i> )

39
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,569
It's a changeling.

40
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:37,194
Stay where you are,
or I'll fire.

41
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:41,281
You.
You are a Metamorph.

42
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,700
I'm a changeling, yes.

43
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,661
Tell the mono-form
to put down its weapon.

44
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,539
Why did you board
our ship?

45
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,417
Because I sensed you were here.

46
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,753
I had to see if it were true--

47
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:57,589
if I'd finally found
another Metamorph.

48
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:01,260
You've never met
another shape-shifter?

49
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,221
I've been trying to find others
of my kind for a long time.

50
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,347
I told you to stay
where you are.

51
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,102
How do we know
he's not a Founder?

52
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:11,270
He's not.

53
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,190
He's one of the hundred.

54
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,858
The hundred?

55
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:21,029
Over the centuries,
our people sent out

56
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,032
100 infant changelings
into the galaxy.

57
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,951
We were to learn
about other species

58
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:28,912
and eventually return home
to share what we'd experienced.

59
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:32,791
That would explain
why I was alone on Varala.

60
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,460
I didn't even know
what I was at first

61
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,005
or that I could assume
other forms.

62
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,381
I was the same way.

63
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,801
I hate to interrupt,
but shouldn't we get him

64
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,970
into a containment field
until we're sure

65
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,554
he's telling the truth?

66
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,307
SHAPE-SHIFTER:
I will allow myself

67
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:51,143
to be taken prisoner
to show my good faith

68
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:55,396
but only if<i> you</i> vouch
for my safety.

69
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:58,025
I do not trust...

70
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,193
humanoids.

71
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:08,576
So, where is he now?

72
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,037
In a holding cell.

73
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:13,540
Captain, he's not
a threat to us.

74
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,959
He's just a changeling
who's traveled a long way

75
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,211
to find out
where he came from.

76
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:18,461
You believe his story?

77
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,963
Yes, sir, I do.

78
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:22,090
How can we be sure
he's not a Founder?

79
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,092
If he<i> were</i> a Founder,
he'd be infected

80
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:27,054
with the same disease that's
afflicting the entire Link.

81
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:28,930
I asked Dr. Bashir to scan him.

82
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,142
His morphogenic matrix
is as stable as mine.

83
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:38,439
Sir, with your permission,
I'd like to release him.

84
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:47,074
Well, Constable,
I'm sure you can appreciate

85
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:50,118
why I'd have reservations
about that.

86
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,704
We're still at war
with your people.

87
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,207
The Founders have
deceived us before.

88
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:59,044
I realize that, sir,
but he is not a Founder.

89
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:00,545
He's one of the hundred.

90
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,839
I'm sure of it.

91
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:06,676
Sir... I'm asking you
to trust me on this.

92
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,056
All right, Constable.

93
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,143
I'll release him
into<i> your</i> custody.

94
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,645
Thank you, sir.

95
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,827
When I found out
our people were

96
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,996
the leaders of the Dominion

97
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:38,917
I realized I had
no place with them.

98
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:42,087
This war they're
fighting is wrong.

99
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,839
I can understand
their distrust of humanoids

100
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,883
but why try
to conquer them?

101
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,927
Better to avoid them
altogether.

102
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:52,431
You don't much care
for humanoids.

103
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:53,848
I know from experience

104
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,893
they don't much care
for changelings.

105
00:07:56,893 --> 00:08:00,981
I think you'll find
the people here
are different.

106
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,023
Oh?

107
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,068
They accepted me.
Have they?

108
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,903
Is that why you stayed?

109
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:11,074
I told you I want no
part of the Founders.

110
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,660
But what about the hundred
that were sent out?

111
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,204
Haven't you tried
to find any of them?

112
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,290
No.

113
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,707
It's a huge galaxy.

114
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,168
They could be anywhere.

115
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:24,338
Hmm. I found<i> you.</i>

116
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,133
I have a life here.

117
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:29,759
I have... friends.

118
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,763
Constable.

119
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,432
When did you first
assume humanoid form?

120
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,892
A little over
30 years ago.

121
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,478
So that's it.

122
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:41,604
It's all still
so new to you.

123
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,357
I spent the first part
of my life

124
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:45,150
living among
humanoids as well.

125
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,485
How long ago
was that?

126
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:48,695
Over 200 years.

127
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,280
Oh...

128
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,782
I must have been sent out
earlier than you.

129
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:56,619
Or it could be
that I was adrift

130
00:08:56,619 --> 00:09:00,040
for a long time
before I was found.

131
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,666
Either way,
it would explain

132
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,584
why you've chosen
to stay here.

133
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:06,171
I, too, was fascinated
by humanoid life

134
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:07,464
in the beginning.

135
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:10,300
But, uh, you
lost interest.

136
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,926
I found it limiting.

137
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:15,055
The Varalans never accepted
me as one of them

138
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:18,225
and I was never really
able to fully mimic

139
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,559
their appearance.

140
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,811
Faces aren't easy.

141
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:26,191
No, and humanoids are not
very tolerant of difference.

142
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,235
Some of them are.

143
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,111
There are dozens

144
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,239
of species
on this station

145
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,698
and they tolerate

146
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,242
each other's
differences very well.

147
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:41,498
Hmm. He has bumps
on his forehead.

148
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:45,210
She has a wrinkled nose,
but basically they're alike.

149
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:49,672
They are bipeds that eat,
sleep, breathe.

150
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,925
You and I are
nothing like them.

151
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,510
We're changelings.

152
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,637
We can be like them
when we choose.

153
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,767
I choose to be like them
as little as possible.

154
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,561
That's where we differ.

155
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:07,065
Let me show you where
you'll be staying.

156
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,156
You haven't told me
your name.

157
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,451
The Varalans
called me Laas.

158
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:19,327
In their language it
means "changeable."

159
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,246
Not very imaginative,
is it?

160
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:22,747
At least it's appropriate.

161
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,707
Mine means "unknown sample."

162
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,751
The scientist who found
me didn't know what I was.

163
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:30,964
These are my quarters.

164
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:34,259
I'll be staying...
somewhere else.

165
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:37,554
Feel free to shape-shift
as you please.

166
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,847
Some of these forms
are quite interesting.

167
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:42,267
This hasn't been used
in some time.

168
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,479
I've... been busy.

169
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,151
Who is this?

170
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,736
Her name is Kira.

171
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:57,324
Ah, I had a mate once.

172
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:58,408
Oh?

173
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,118
On Varala.

174
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:03,746
Not long after I first
assumed humanoid form.

175
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,374
And... what happened?

176
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:09,085
We couldn't have children.

177
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,505
Uh, that was
important to her.

178
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:19,762
Is it something that
matters to this Kira?

179
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,933
We've never discussed it.

180
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,645
Neither did we...
at first.

181
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:34,277
Do our people reproduce?

182
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,946
It's more complicated
than that.

183
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,323
In our natural state

184
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,617
we don't exist
as separate entities.

185
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,410
I don't understand.

186
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:46,206
Our people spend most
of their time in the Link.

187
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,582
The Link?

188
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:50,793
It involves
a melding into one--

189
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:55,756
a merging of thought
and form, idea...

190
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,050
and sensation.

191
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,426
You're speaking
in riddles.

192
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,555
It's difficult to explain.

193
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:03,097
Then don't.

194
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,307
Show me.

195
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,519
Of course.

196
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,608
Take it.

197
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:49,352
For the first time
in my life

198
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,896
I understand...

199
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,772
how I was meant to exist.

200
00:12:56,526 --> 00:13:00,196
You've given up a great deal
to remain here.

201
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,742
Yes.

202
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,579
Yes, I have.

203
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:13,042
But I won't have anything to do
with the Founders and their war.

204
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,211
Odo...

205
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,046
we linked.

206
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,632
I know the truth.

207
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:21,426
You stayed here because of Kira.

208
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,637
If it weren't for her

209
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:27,223
you would be with our people,
war or no war.

210
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,767
You would be...

211
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,268
a Founder.

212
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:42,155
(<i> door opening</i> )

213
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,531
Hi.

214
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,824
Hello, Nerys.

215
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,076
I can't believe it.

216
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,495
Another changeling.

217
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,413
What's he like?

218
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,123
(<i> sighs</i> )

219
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:54,334
He's...

220
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,462
complicated.

221
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,714
Like you.

222
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,717
(<i> chuckling</i> )

223
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,010
You all right?

224
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,220
I'm fine.

225
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,683
You seem far away.

226
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,812
We linked.

227
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:16,648
I see.

228
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:18,566
There's nothing to worry about.

229
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,234
He's not a Founder.

230
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,153
He's not trying to lure me
to the Dominion.

231
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:25,573
The Link is part
of what we are.

232
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:29,118
It comes as naturally to us
as talking does to humanoids.

233
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:33,331
It's a little more personal
than-than talking, isn't it?

234
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,127
I suppose.

235
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,004
So...

236
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,840
do I get to meet him?

237
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,176
If you like.

238
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,260
I would.

239
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,637
Then I'll arrange it.

240
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:50,306
(<i> chuckling</i> )

241
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,771
Here they are.

242
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,736
This is Laas.

243
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,153
Nerys.
Julian.

244
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,572
Ezri.
Miles.

245
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:06,906
We've met.

246
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,366
Look, I'm sorry.

247
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,326
We didn't know
who you were at first.

248
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,371
You gave us quite a scare
when you rammed the runabout.

249
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,627
I've always wondered
how it would feel

250
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,714
to be able to fly
through space like that.

251
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:26,008
It's a shame you're
incapable of ever
experiencing it.

252
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,177
Guess so.

253
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,055
Tell us about Varala.

254
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,015
No Federation ship's
ever been there.

255
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,852
It's just the same
as any other planet--

256
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:37,395
overrun with humanoids

257
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:39,230
cities and farms
everywhere

258
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,565
other life-forms

259
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,442
displaced from their habitats.

260
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,194
Once I migrated
to the southern continent

261
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,738
with a herd of volg.

262
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:49,115
When we returned
to our breeding grounds

263
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:52,285
the following summer,
they had been fenced off.

264
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:55,079
The herd died out
within two generations.

265
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,124
It's always that way
where humanoids thrive.

266
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,877
They disrupt
the natural balance.

267
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,629
Who ordered the vilm-steak?

268
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,506
Uh, um,
you better keep that warm.

269
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,425
Whatever you say.

270
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,595
The truth is I prefer

271
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:14,348
the so-called
primitive life-forms.

272
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,852
They exist as
they were meant to--

273
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,729
by following...

274
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,815
their instincts.

275
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:26,068
No words get in the way,
no lies, no deceptions.

276
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,362
We're not the ones
who can disguise ourselves

277
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,697
as anything we want.

278
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,741
Meaning...?

279
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:35,077
Meaning shape-shifters
are not to be trusted.

280
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,833
I trust Odo.

281
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,835
Of course, you trust Odo.

282
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,461
Look at him.

283
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,964
You've convinced him
that he is as limited

284
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:47,381
as you are.

285
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,800
Laas...

286
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,844
You've seen through
our evil plan.

287
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:51,970
Oop. Foiled again.

288
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,429
It's not funny.

289
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,931
No.

290
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,517
I'm very worried
for him.

291
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:00,520
Odo can take care of himself.

292
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,063
Thank you, Colonel.

293
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,234
<i>Well...</i>

294
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,863
(<i> chuckles uneasily</i> ):
this has been...

295
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:11,823
interesting.

296
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:13,867
If you'll excuse
us, Colonel

297
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,910
Counselor, Doctor

298
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,328
Chief?

299
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,079
Laas?

300
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:25,503
Nice to see you again.

301
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:29,131
This way.

302
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,055
Was it really necessary
to insult my friends?

303
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,473
I was merely
speaking my mind.

304
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,017
Well, you could
call it that.

305
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:40,935
Humanoids are such
tragic creatures.

306
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:42,395
They've lost
the ability

307
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,188
to take joy in
simply existing

308
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,106
and yet they haven't
evolved to the next level

309
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,860
where consciousness exists
independent of form.

310
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,696
You're certainly not afraid
to make grand generalizations.

311
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,865
Well, I've been many
things in my time, Odo.

312
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:55,199
I speak from experience.

313
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,117
Enough talk.
Link with me.

314
00:17:58,536 --> 00:17:59,787
Here?

315
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,080
Why not?

316
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,041
I don't think
that's a good idea.

317
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,584
Are you embarrassed?

318
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,794
No.

319
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,963
You don't want to do anything
to remind them

320
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,882
that you're not
truly a humanoid.

321
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:13,634
I don't go out of my way
to point it out, no.

322
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,135
Why not?

323
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,888
Are you afraid
they will reject you?

324
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:19,390
I don't like to confront
people with something

325
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,225
that might make
them uncomfortable.

326
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:24,812
So, you deny your true nature
in order to fit in?

327
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,856
You're reading
too much into it.

328
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:30,317
Before I came here,
when was the last time
you assumed another form?

329
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:36,240
You can't even remember.

330
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,743
You've been pretending
to be a humanoid for so long

331
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:41,287
it doesn't even occur to you
that you can be anything else.

332
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,580
That's not true.

333
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,706
I've just been
involved with...

334
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,833
other things lately.

335
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,334
Like what, courting Kira?

336
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,169
She can't even link
with you.

337
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,965
Leave her out of this.

338
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,008
It won't last.

339
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:56,469
The fact
that your relationship failed

340
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,304
doesn't mean that mine will.

341
00:18:58,304 --> 00:18:59,931
True.

342
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:01,891
And, if you're very lucky

343
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:04,435
you can watch her
grow old and die.

344
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:08,856
I think you should stay
out of my affairs.

345
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:12,986
I don't want to see you
make the same mistakes I made.

346
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:15,029
You're wasting your time

347
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,990
trying to be a humanoid.

348
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,241
You're limiting yourself.

349
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:22,036
Let's leave here, Odo.

350
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:24,998
Let's find the others.

351
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:27,374
100 were sent away

352
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,085
and they're out there...

353
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:31,045
somewhere.

354
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:34,507
If we can find even a few of
them, we can form a new Link.

355
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,926
Think of it, Odo.

356
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:40,429
We can exist
the way we were meant to.

357
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,308
As changelings.

358
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,986
I can't believe
he actually thought

359
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:57,237
you'd just drop everything
and leave with him.

360
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:02,409
He just can't understand
why I want to stay here.

361
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,453
How did he take it
when you said no?

362
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:09,458
You did say no, didn't you?

363
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,961
I told him I'd
think about it.

364
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:14,213
I didn't want to dismiss
it out of hand.

365
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,256
He would have
taken offense.

366
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,972
Why do you look
at me like that?

367
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:27,643
It just... bothers me

368
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,770
that he thinks
that you're not happy here.

369
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,857
Makes me think he knows
something that I don't.

370
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,401
What makes
you say that?

371
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,113
He linked with you.

372
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:41,199
Ah.

373
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:42,491
Something about that

374
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,869
gave him the impression that...

375
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:46,286
you might want to leave here.

376
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:51,584
It's just wishful
thinking on his part.

377
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,669
The thought of the two
of us going off together

378
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,171
looking for the others

379
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:58,049
exploring the galaxy
as changelings...

380
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:00,009
it's very alluring.

381
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:02,553
To<i> him.</i>

382
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:05,056
Sounds like it's alluring
to you, too.

383
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:07,934
I'm... happy...

384
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,643
here.

385
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:26,077
I'm sorry
I can't link with you.

386
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,999
(<i> sighs</i> )

387
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,085
It doesn't
matter, Nerys.

388
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:38,464
I love you.

389
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:01,821
Computer, activate
fire suppression sys...

390
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:06,575
Laas?

391
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,330
I need to talk to you.

392
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,837
You didn't realize
it was me.

393
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:20,673
Did you even know we
could exist as fire?

394
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:23,634
I didn't think so.

395
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:24,802
No matter.

396
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,262
Once we're away from here

397
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:28,264
I'll teach you
to become things

398
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:30,390
you've never
even dreamed of.

399
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,144
I'm not leaving.

400
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:35,188
I'm staying here.

401
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:37,190
Why?

402
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,233
So you can keep
on pretending

403
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:40,567
to be one of them?

404
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:44,404
I'm sorry
if you're disappointed.

405
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:47,700
I'll survive.

406
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,369
And when I find some
of the others...

407
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:52,872
I'll send for you.

408
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,123
You'll change your mind.

409
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:56,167
You'll join us.

410
00:22:56,167 --> 00:23:02,048
It could take a long time for
you to find another changeling.

411
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:04,424
Is that supposed
to discourage me?

412
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:09,096
All I'm saying is you don't have
to leave right away.

413
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:12,058
I wouldn't mind the company
of another changeling.

414
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:14,434
I'm sure you
wouldn't mind either.

415
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,771
All right, Odo.

416
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:22,735
I won't abandon you
to these mono-forms.

417
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:25,571
As a favor to you...

418
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,281
I'll stay a while.

419
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:28,615
Well, you might as well.

420
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:30,701
If you can't get along with me

421
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:33,996
what makes you think you can get
along with any other changeling?

422
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:37,875
Just remember, I have
no interest in mono-forms

423
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,460
even if they are your...
friends.

424
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,256
After what happened at Quark's,
I don't think

425
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:46,759
you have to worry about
an overcrowded social schedule.

426
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,427
Good.

427
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:14,287
(<i> excited voices outside</i> )

428
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,668
(<i> children laughing</i> )

429
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:25,298
Children, children.

430
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:27,258
What?

431
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:34,390
Great. The environmental
system's out again.

432
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,267
There goes our holosuite
reservation.

433
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:37,435
I better go see
what the problem is.

434
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:39,270
Don't bother, Chief.

435
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,938
There's nothing wrong with
the environmental system.

436
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:42,982
Then where's all
this fog coming from?

437
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,317
It's not fog.

438
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:45,818
It's Laas.

439
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,194
Laas?

440
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,862
What's he doing?

441
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,197
Being fog.

442
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,657
What's it look like?

443
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,491
Can't he be fog
somewhere else?

444
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:55,453
Or at night
when nobody's around?

445
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:57,371
He's not hurting anyone.

446
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:58,372
Still...

447
00:24:58,372 --> 00:24:59,915
it's kind of creepy.

448
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,334
Careful, Miles.

449
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:02,500
He might hear you.

450
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,710
(<i> loudly</i> ):
Good.

451
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:13,553
Laas?

452
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,558
<i>Laas.</i>

453
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:39,079
Well... congratulations.

454
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:42,875
You've managed to disrupt
the entire Promenade.

455
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,668
I was just relaxing.

456
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:47,838
If you want to relax,
do it in private.

457
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:50,299
Did I embarrass you?

458
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:52,176
<i>Ka'vek!</i>

459
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:54,387
What is this Founder
doing here?

460
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:55,721
He's not a Founder.

461
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,181
Now, move along.

462
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:59,725
Don't change form
in my presence again.

463
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:02,144
I will change form
where I please.

464
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:05,105
Look at him.

465
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,148
Look at the hate
in his eyes.

466
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:08,108
Laas.

467
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:10,568
Your hands are stained with
the blood of Klingon warriors.

468
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:13,906
But then the stench
would still be on them.

469
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:15,408
<i>P'tak!</i>

470
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:16,574
Mine's bigger.

471
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:17,701
<i>Ke'chaw!</i>

472
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:18,869
No.

473
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,164
(<i> groans</i> )

474
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:28,128
No!

475
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:41,058
Dr. Bashir wasn't able
to save the Klingon's life.

476
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:42,393
General Martok

477
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:44,728
has asked that
Laas be detained

478
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,772
until the magistrate
can determine jurisdiction.

479
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:47,814
Jurisdiction?

480
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:48,899
The Klingons

481
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:49,983
want to extradite him.

482
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,485
That's ridiculous.

483
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:52,610
He killed that Klingon
in self-defense.

484
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,029
That is in dispute.

485
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,948
He was about to draw
his disrupter.

486
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,408
According to the
other Klingon

487
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,577
he was reaching
for his dagger.

488
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:01,703
Are you saying that's not true?

489
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:04,873
It all happened too fast, but
their intentions were obvious.

490
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,083
One of them put a knife
in his chest.

491
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:07,876
The Klingons
are arguing

492
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,087
that since Laas knew
he couldn't be harmed by a knife

493
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:13,757
that he wasn't justified
in responding with deadly force.

494
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:16,718
Since when do the Klingons
resort to legal quibbling?

495
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:19,012
They get involved in fights
all the time.

496
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,139
They never file charges.

497
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:21,599
It isn't honorable.

498
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:23,267
In this case, the Klingons

499
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:25,311
are exercising their rights
under the law.

500
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:27,187
Sir, they are only doing this

501
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:30,107
because they distrust
changelings.

502
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:31,691
He should not have
provoked them.

503
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:32,943
Provoked them?

504
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:36,363
<i>They</i> attacked Laas.

505
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:40,951
They claim he surrounded them
menacingly.

506
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:44,204
They felt menaced by fog.

507
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,123
They weren't
the only ones.

508
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:48,875
There are 12 other people
who filed complaints.

509
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:52,670
Is it a crime to shape-shift
on the Promenade?

510
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:56,592
It's not a crime, but it's
obviously not a good idea.

511
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:59,261
You're going to allow
the Klingons to extradite him

512
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,472
knowing they won't give him
a fair trial.

513
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:02,806
That's not
my decision.

514
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,433
It's up to
the magistrate.

515
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:06,519
But you'd just as soon
be rid of him.

516
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:08,395
You never wanted him on the
station in the first place.

517
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,896
I practically had to beg you

518
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:11,315
to let him out of
that holding cell.

519
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:13,526
That's quite enough, Constable.

520
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:18,238
Now, Martok has expressed
some concerns

521
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,948
about our security arrangements.

522
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,451
Meaning?

523
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:24,244
He's not sure it's appropriate

524
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,539
that you should be
in charge of the prisoner.

525
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,210
May I ask why?

526
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:34,838
Because you were a witness
to the alleged crime.

527
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:37,341
Well, that's a relief.

528
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:41,595
For a moment, I thought you were
going to say it's because...

529
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:43,889
I'm a changeling.

530
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:00,406
Odo.

531
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:02,157
I heard about your friend.

532
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,951
Rumor has it the Klingons
want to put him on trial.

533
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:07,120
They're the ones who
should be put on trial.

534
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,665
If they'd attacked anyone
other than a changeling

535
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:10,832
they would be.

536
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:13,419
You're probably right.

537
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:16,296
That fog episode certainly
didn't help matters.

538
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:19,966
Laas was only doing
what comes naturally to us.

539
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:22,302
You never pulled
a stunt like that.

540
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,597
You're smart enough to know
that people don't want

541
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:26,432
to be reminded
that you're different.

542
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:30,185
Who wants to see
somebody turn into goo?

543
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,812
I hope you don't do that
around Kira.

544
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:34,565
Why shouldn't I?

545
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:38,277
Well, if she's anything like me,
she'd rather you didn't.

546
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:39,945
Don't you get it, Odo?

547
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:41,655
We humanoids
are a product

548
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:44,032
of millions of years
of evolution.

549
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,784
Our ancestors learned
the hard way

550
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,036
that what you don't know
might kill you.

551
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,205
They wouldn't have survived
if they hadn't have jumped back

552
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,207
when they encountered
a snake coiled in the muck.

553
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,792
And, now,
millions of years later

554
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,753
that instinct is still there.

555
00:29:55,753 --> 00:29:57,546
It's genetic.

556
00:29:57,546 --> 00:30:00,882
Our tolerance to other
life-forms doesn't extend

557
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:03,969
beyond the two-arm,
two-leg variety.

558
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:06,805
I hate to break this to you...

559
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:10,559
but when you're
in your natural state...

560
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:14,813
you're more than
our poor old genes can handle.

561
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,149
So what are you saying, Quark?

562
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:19,777
That the Klingons
couldn't help what they did

563
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:21,236
because of their genes?

564
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,781
I'm not trying to excuse
what they did.

565
00:30:23,781 --> 00:30:25,741
I'm only telling you

566
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,200
<i>why</i> it happened.

567
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,452
Watch your step, Odo.

568
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,621
We're at war with your people.

569
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:32,872
This is no time

570
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:36,710
for a changeling pride
demonstration on the Promenade.

571
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,606
Constable.

572
00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:59,232
I'd like to have

573
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,651
a few minutes alone
with the prisoner.

574
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:02,361
Sorry, sir.

575
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:03,737
I have my orders.

576
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:21,296
I don't know what to say.

577
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,089
You could say
you were wrong.

578
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,425
You could say
the people here

579
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:28,136
are no different
than any other humanoids.

580
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,181
Hopefully, this will all

581
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:33,225
get straightened out
at your hearing.

582
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:36,770
I am sure it will be
fair and impartial.

583
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:40,023
Just tell them
exactly what happened.

584
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,027
My word against a humanoid's.

585
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,696
Whom do you think
this magistrate

586
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:46,905
is going to believe?

587
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,911
I shouldn't have
convinced you to stay.

588
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:56,248
If I had just... let you go

589
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:57,624
none of this
would have happened.

590
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,918
My only consolation

591
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,755
is that this may
finally make you understand

592
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:06,216
that<i> you</i> don't belong here.

593
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:09,595
You saw the hatred
in that Klingon's eyes.

594
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:11,388
Perhaps now you'll recognize it

595
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:13,432
when you see it
hiding in the faces

596
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:17,143
of your so-called
friends.

597
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,567
They tolerate you, Odo...

598
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:25,819
because you emulate them.

599
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:28,154
What higher
flattery is there?

600
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:31,408
"I, who can be anything,
choose to be like you."

601
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:34,745
But even when you make yourself
in their image

602
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:37,581
they know you are not truly
one of them.

603
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:41,376
They know that what
you appear to be
does not reflect

604
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,921
what you really are.

605
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:46,632
It's only a mask.

606
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:49,718
What lies underneath

607
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:52,679
is alien to them

608
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:55,515
and so they fear it.

609
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,727
And that fear can turn to hate

610
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:00,813
in the blink
of an eye.

611
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:06,234
They're going
to extradite him.

612
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,153
You don't know that.

613
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:10,572
Yes, I do, and no
one is going to do
anything to stop it.

614
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:11,907
There's not much
anyone can do.

615
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,700
If he weren't
a changeling

616
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,494
the Captain would find
a way to intervene.

617
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:16,745
Oh, no, that's unfair.

618
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,121
Is it?

619
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,165
You're starting
to sound like Laas.

620
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:21,708
Well, maybe that's
because I'm starting

621
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,126
to see things
more clearly now.

622
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,628
What is that
supposed to mean?

623
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:26,797
Look at me, Nerys.
What do you see?

624
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:28,298
I see you.

625
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:33,345
No. No, this is just
a form I borrowed.

626
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:36,556
I could just as easily be
someone or<i> something</i> else.

627
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:37,724
I know that

628
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:41,060
but this...

629
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,189
is what you have
always chosen to be.

630
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,692
A man...

631
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:50,946
a good and honest man...

632
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:54,616
a man I fell in love with.

633
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:57,995
Are you trying to tell me
that he never really existed?

634
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:01,247
I don't know.

635
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:09,756
I care for you

636
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,758
more than anyone
I've ever known.

637
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:15,345
These last few months have
been the happiest of my life.

638
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:17,430
But even so...

639
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:20,934
part of me wishes that Laas
and I were out there right now

640
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:22,602
searching for the others

641
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,771
existing as<i> changelings.</i>

642
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,982
Because that's what I am.

643
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:28,483
Not a humanoid.

644
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,777
I'm a changeling.

645
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:35,574
Well, then maybe
you're right.

646
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:38,076
Maybe you do
belong out there.

647
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:01,600
Can I help you, Colonel?

648
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,393
Uh... I need to talk
to the prisoner.

649
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:04,644
Alone.

650
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,813
Aye, sir.

651
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:30,169
Go to the third planet
in the Koralis system.

652
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:32,171
You'll find an orbital tether

653
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:34,633
running down to
an abandoned mining complex.

654
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,635
I'll tell Odo to meet you there.

655
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:39,721
Is this some kind of a trick?

656
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,848
Do you want to get out of here
or not?

657
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:49,856
That vent will lead you
through some conduits
to an airlock.

658
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:53,860
Why?

659
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:57,530
I love him.

660
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,459
Escaped?

661
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,756
How did he get through
the containment field?

662
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:16,174
KIRA:
I can't explain it.

663
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,717
All I can tell you
is what I saw.

664
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,719
He turned into some kind
of plasma energy

665
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,262
and forced his way through.

666
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,472
Before I could stop him,
he had disappeared

667
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:23,765
into the air vent.

668
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,600
According to
the operations log

669
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,978
one of the airlocks was
activated shortly after that.

670
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:29,437
If he left the station

671
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,397
why didn't our
sensors detect him?

672
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,817
A Corvallen freighter was
leaving about the same time.

673
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:37,112
He must have shadowed it
to keep from being spotted.

674
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:38,864
He could be anywhere by now.

675
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:41,533
General Martok is not going
to be happy about this.

676
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:44,870
By fleeing, the changeling
has demonstrated his guilt.

677
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:48,456
Either that, or his lack of
faith in our justice system.

678
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:51,292
He must be apprehended
and brought to trial.

679
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:54,046
Mr. Worf,
have all available runabouts

680
00:36:54,046 --> 00:36:56,048
begin a sector-wide search.

681
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:58,091
Aye, sir.

682
00:36:58,091 --> 00:36:59,926
Good luck.

683
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,928
Constable, I know
it's a long shot

684
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,972
but I'm sure you can agree

685
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:07,059
we should do everything we can
to find him.

686
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:09,061
Of course.

687
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:11,146
Dismissed.

688
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,206
Level 9.

689
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:38,048
You didn't hide
it very well...

690
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:42,052
that you're glad
he escaped.

691
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:44,721
I should have known
he'd be able to escape.

692
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:46,181
What's a force field

693
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:48,307
to a changeling
with his abilities?

694
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:54,689
You said you wished you
were out there with him.

695
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,983
Well, it's not too late.

696
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,985
I don't understand.

697
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:03,073
He's waiting for you at an
abandoned mine on Koralis III.

698
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:09,370
You... helped him escape?

699
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:12,207
I don't want you
to stay here under some...

700
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:14,417
sense of obligation.

701
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,717
Good luck.

702
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:32,727
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

703
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:11,850
Laas?

704
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:17,480
I knew you would come.

705
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:22,027
This is a new beginning
for us, Odo

706
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:25,197
a new beginning for our people.

707
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:28,366
You and I are about to embark

708
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,827
on the adventure
of our lives.

709
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:34,497
What's wrong?

710
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,791
I'm not going with you.

711
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:43,173
Why are you here?

712
00:39:43,173 --> 00:39:46,051
I've come to say good-bye.

713
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:48,845
Don't be a fool.

714
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:49,846
What are you holding on to?

715
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:51,514
Kira?

716
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:54,059
Even she knows that this
is what's best for you.

717
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:56,686
Why else would she have
helped me to escape?

718
00:39:56,686 --> 00:40:00,065
You really don't know, do you?

719
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:02,234
You've no idea what it means

720
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:06,196
to love someone enough
to let them go.

721
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:07,906
She let you go

722
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:11,576
so that you could find out
where you belong.

723
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:13,661
I know where I belong.

724
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,372
Laas...

725
00:40:15,372 --> 00:40:18,666
humanoids are not
the petty, limited creatures

726
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,335
you perceive them to be.

727
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:24,381
What Nerys did should
prove that, even to you.

728
00:40:24,381 --> 00:40:27,842
Love conquers all.
Is that it?

729
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,471
I'm sorry you can't understand.

730
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:35,183
You've done many things

731
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:38,228
<i>been</i> many things...

732
00:40:38,228 --> 00:40:41,898
but you've never known love.

733
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:44,276
Compared to the Link

734
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:47,112
it is a pale shadow

735
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:50,365
a feeble attempt to compensate
for the isolation

736
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:52,075
that mono-forms feel

737
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:55,328
because they are trapped
within themselves.

738
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:58,331
Perhaps the fact
that it's not easy

739
00:40:58,331 --> 00:41:01,293
is what makes it worthwhile.

740
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:03,128
Odo...

741
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:05,504
the Founders are dying.

742
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:08,383
This could be your last chance

743
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:12,011
to exist the way
you were meant to.

744
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:15,432
Don't throw it away.

745
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,101
You'd better go.

746
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:19,644
They're looking for you.

747
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:24,399
Good luck.

748
00:41:30,447 --> 00:41:33,032
And to you, Odo.

749
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,327
You'll need it more than I.

750
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:01,060
KIRA:
Watch over him.

751
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:04,022
Help him find his way.

752
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:06,483
(<i> door chimes</i> )

753
00:42:06,483 --> 00:42:08,567
Yes.

754
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:20,788
I didn't think
I'd see you again.

755
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,581
I couldn't go.

756
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:39,807
If I ever made you feel
that you couldn't
be yourself with me...

757
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:42,519
I'm sorry.

758
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:46,731
I want to know you...

759
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,693
the way you really are.

760
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,647
(<i> sighs</i> )
