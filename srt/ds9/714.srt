1
00:00:12,923 --> 00:00:14,392
How long was I asleep?

2
00:00:14,426 --> 00:00:15,861
Almost two hours.

3
00:00:15,897 --> 00:00:18,130
You dropped out of warp.

4
00:00:18,169 --> 00:00:19,798
Must be close to home.

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,042
We entered the Bajoran system
a few minutes ago.

6
00:00:23,081 --> 00:00:24,641
What's that?

7
00:00:24,685 --> 00:00:29,061
The shopkeeper I bought it from
called it a "knickknack."

8
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:33,095
I didn't know
you collected knickknacks.

9
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,441
It's a present for Kira.

10
00:00:35,478 --> 00:00:37,540
Oh...

11
00:00:37,585 --> 00:00:40,114
You, you don't think
she'll like it?

12
00:00:40,157 --> 00:00:43,222
Oh, I'm sure she'll like it.

13
00:00:43,265 --> 00:00:45,760
It's just that I didn't get
anything for Keiko.

14
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:47,775
Ah.

15
00:00:47,843 --> 00:00:50,782
Well, the conference kept
you pretty busy.

16
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:52,286
Well, you found time
to get something.

17
00:00:56,798 --> 00:00:58,598
Not chocolates as well.

18
00:00:58,637 --> 00:01:01,337
Hmm. Rigelian chocolates...
her favorite.

19
00:01:02,346 --> 00:01:03,406
I'll buy them from you.

20
00:01:03,448 --> 00:01:05,180
I beg your pardon?

21
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,918
I'll buy them from you.

22
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:08,758
Come on, Odo.

23
00:01:08,828 --> 00:01:10,092
You don't have to give her
two presents.

24
00:01:10,132 --> 00:01:11,122
You've only been gone a day.

25
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:14,336
I'm sorry, Miles,
but the answer is no.

26
00:01:19,088 --> 00:01:20,786
There's something behind us.

27
00:01:20,858 --> 00:01:23,193
It's gaining on us fast.

28
00:01:37,735 --> 00:01:39,364
You think it's friendly?

29
00:01:39,405 --> 00:01:41,740
I hope so.

30
00:01:41,778 --> 00:01:44,250
It's certainly taken
an interest in us.

31
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:48,859
Uh-oh.

32
00:01:48,928 --> 00:01:50,796
It's gone.

33
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:52,359
- What?
- According to the sensors

34
00:01:52,405 --> 00:01:54,103
there's nothing out there.

35
00:01:54,142 --> 00:01:55,577
Well, where'd it go?

36
00:02:31,368 --> 00:02:33,305
It's a changeling.

37
00:04:35,266 --> 00:04:37,601
Stay where you are,
or I'll fire.

38
00:04:37,638 --> 00:04:41,603
You.
You are a Metamorph.

39
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,311
I'm a changeling, yes.

40
00:04:43,353 --> 00:04:46,292
Tell the mono-form
to put down its weapon.

41
00:04:46,326 --> 00:04:48,890
Why did you board our ship?

42
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:51,838
Because I sensed you were here.

43
00:04:51,873 --> 00:04:54,174
I had to see if it were true...

44
00:04:54,213 --> 00:04:56,981
if I'd finally found
another Metamorph.

45
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,688
You've never met
another shape-shifter?

46
00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:03,668
I've been trying to find others
of my kind for a long time.

47
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:05,731
I told you to stay
where you are.

48
00:05:07,646 --> 00:05:09,617
How do we know
he's not a Founder?

49
00:05:09,651 --> 00:05:10,677
He's not.

50
00:05:12,258 --> 00:05:14,628
He's one of the hundred.

51
00:05:14,664 --> 00:05:16,133
The hundred?

52
00:05:16,168 --> 00:05:20,270
Over the centuries,
our people sent out

53
00:05:20,311 --> 00:05:23,376
100 infant changelings
into the galaxy.

54
00:05:23,453 --> 00:05:25,047
We were to learn
about other species

55
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,258
and eventually return home
to share what we'd experienced.

56
00:05:28,298 --> 00:05:32,206
That would explain
why I was alone on Varala.

57
00:05:32,241 --> 00:05:34,907
I didn't even know
what I was at first

58
00:05:34,948 --> 00:05:37,420
or that I could assume
other forms.

59
00:05:37,488 --> 00:05:39,858
I was the same way.

60
00:05:39,893 --> 00:05:42,160
I hate to interrupt,
but shouldn't we get him

61
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:44,363
into a containment field
until we're sure

62
00:05:44,405 --> 00:05:45,965
he's telling the truth?

63
00:05:46,008 --> 00:05:47,272
I will allow myself

64
00:05:47,312 --> 00:05:50,684
to be taken prisoner
to show my good faith

65
00:05:50,721 --> 00:05:54,823
but only if you vouch
for my safety.

66
00:05:54,864 --> 00:05:57,428
I do not trust...

67
00:05:57,471 --> 00:05:58,633
humanoids.

68
00:06:05,558 --> 00:06:07,928
So, where is he now?

69
00:06:07,963 --> 00:06:09,330
In a holding cell.

70
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:12,967
Captain, he's not
a threat to us.

71
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,243
He's just a changeling
who's traveled a long way

72
00:06:15,281 --> 00:06:16,716
to find out
where he came from.

73
00:06:16,753 --> 00:06:17,881
You believe his story?

74
00:06:17,921 --> 00:06:18,743
Yes, sir, I do.

75
00:06:18,877 --> 00:06:21,144
How can we be sure
he's not a Founder?

76
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,120
If he were a Founder,
he'd be infected

77
00:06:23,154 --> 00:06:25,922
with the same disease that's
afflicting the entire Link.

78
00:06:26,028 --> 00:06:27,931
I asked Dr. Bashir to scan him.

79
00:06:28,033 --> 00:06:30,904
His morphogenic matrix
is as stable as mine.

80
00:06:32,946 --> 00:06:37,356
Sir, with your permission,
I'd like to release him.

81
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:46,144
Well, Constable,
I'm sure you can appreciate

82
00:06:46,179 --> 00:06:49,175
why I'd have reservations
about that.

83
00:06:49,219 --> 00:06:51,623
We're still at war
with your people.

84
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:54,257
The Founders have
deceived us before.

85
00:06:54,299 --> 00:06:58,105
I realize that, sir,
but he is not a Founder.

86
00:06:58,142 --> 00:06:59,509
He's one of the hundred.

87
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:01,778
I'm sure of it.

88
00:07:01,817 --> 00:07:05,520
Sir... I'm asking you
to trust me on this.

89
00:07:07,632 --> 00:07:09,830
All right, Constable.

90
00:07:11,408 --> 00:07:14,108
I'll release him
into your custody.

91
00:07:14,148 --> 00:07:16,518
Thank you, sir.

92
00:07:29,687 --> 00:07:33,959
When I found out our people were
the leaders of the Dominion

93
00:07:33,998 --> 00:07:37,906
I realized I had
no place with them.

94
00:07:37,941 --> 00:07:41,006
This war they're fighting
is wrong.

95
00:07:41,049 --> 00:07:43,749
I can understand
their distrust of humanoids

96
00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:45,783
but why try to conquer them?

97
00:07:45,827 --> 00:07:47,923
Better to avoid them altogether.

98
00:07:47,966 --> 00:07:51,407
You don't much care
for humanoids.

99
00:07:51,441 --> 00:07:52,740
I know from experience

100
00:07:52,778 --> 00:07:55,980
they don't much care
for changelings.

101
00:07:56,019 --> 00:08:00,189
I think you'll find
the people here are different.

102
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,198
Oh?

103
00:08:01,232 --> 00:08:02,531
They accepted me.

104
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:03,731
Have they?

105
00:08:03,772 --> 00:08:05,834
Is that why you stayed?

106
00:08:05,877 --> 00:08:09,910
I told you I want no part
of the Founders.

107
00:08:09,954 --> 00:08:12,620
But what about the hundred
that were sent out?

108
00:08:12,661 --> 00:08:15,190
Haven't you tried
to find any of them?

109
00:08:15,234 --> 00:08:17,330
No.

110
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:18,636
It's a huge galaxy.

111
00:08:18,676 --> 00:08:20,168
They could be anywhere.

112
00:08:20,213 --> 00:08:23,244
Hmm. I found you.

113
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,024
I have a life here.

114
00:08:27,064 --> 00:08:28,658
I have... friends.

115
00:08:31,307 --> 00:08:32,275
Constable.

116
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,508
When did you first
assume humanoid form?

117
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:36,816
A little over 30 years ago.

118
00:08:36,854 --> 00:08:38,517
So that's it.

119
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,587
It's all still so new to you.

120
00:08:40,631 --> 00:08:42,363
I spent the first part
of my life

121
00:08:42,402 --> 00:08:44,065
living among humanoids as well.

122
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,473
How long ago was that?

123
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:47,639
Over 200 years.

124
00:08:47,682 --> 00:08:49,117
Oh...

125
00:08:49,152 --> 00:08:51,818
I must have been sent out
earlier than you.

126
00:08:51,859 --> 00:08:55,699
Or it could be
that I was adrift

127
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:58,971
for a long time
before I was found.

128
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:02,542
Either way, it would explain
why you've chosen to stay here.

129
00:09:02,586 --> 00:09:04,990
I, too, was fascinated
by humanoid life

130
00:09:05,025 --> 00:09:06,119
in the beginning.

131
00:09:06,161 --> 00:09:09,294
But, uh, you lost interest.

132
00:09:09,336 --> 00:09:10,771
I found it limiting.

133
00:09:10,806 --> 00:09:13,939
The Varalans never accepted
me as one of them

134
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:17,149
and I was never really
able to fully mimic

135
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:18,590
their appearance.

136
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:20,756
Faces aren't easy.

137
00:09:20,797 --> 00:09:25,103
No, and humanoids are not
very tolerant of difference.

138
00:09:25,142 --> 00:09:27,272
Some of them are.

139
00:09:27,314 --> 00:09:31,552
There are dozens
of species on this station

140
00:09:31,591 --> 00:09:34,086
and they tolerate each other's
differences very well.

141
00:09:34,131 --> 00:09:39,406
Hmm.
He has bumps on his forehead.

142
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:44,146
She has a wrinkled nose,
but basically they're alike.

143
00:09:44,189 --> 00:09:48,690
They are bipeds that eat,
sleep, breathe.

144
00:09:48,734 --> 00:09:50,932
You and I are nothing like them.

145
00:09:50,972 --> 00:09:52,532
We're changelings.

146
00:09:52,577 --> 00:09:55,642
We can be like them
when we choose.

147
00:09:57,089 --> 00:09:59,789
I choose to be like them
as little as possible.

148
00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:01,595
That's where we differ.

149
00:10:03,739 --> 00:10:06,006
Let me show you where
you'll be staying.

150
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:14,126
You haven't told me your name.

151
00:10:14,164 --> 00:10:16,568
The Varalans called me Laas.

152
00:10:16,604 --> 00:10:18,541
In their language it
means "changeable."

153
00:10:18,575 --> 00:10:20,204
Not very imaginative, is it?

154
00:10:20,246 --> 00:10:21,772
At least it's appropriate.

155
00:10:21,817 --> 00:10:23,811
Mine means "unknown sample."

156
00:10:23,855 --> 00:10:25,792
The scientist who found
me didn't know what I was.

157
00:10:28,467 --> 00:10:30,027
These are my quarters.

158
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:33,340
I'll be staying...
somewhere else.

159
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:36,683
Feel free to shape-shift
as you please.

160
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,021
Some of these forms
are quite interesting.

161
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:41,223
This hasn't been used
in some time.

162
00:10:42,334 --> 00:10:44,430
I've... been busy.

163
00:10:48,684 --> 00:10:50,153
Who is this?

164
00:10:50,187 --> 00:10:52,853
Her name is Kira.

165
00:10:52,894 --> 00:10:56,391
Ah, I had a mate once.

166
00:10:56,436 --> 00:10:57,871
Oh?

167
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,035
On Varala.

168
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:02,779
Not long after I first
assumed humanoid form.

169
00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:05,553
And... what happened?

170
00:11:05,592 --> 00:11:08,156
We couldn't have children.

171
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:10,397
Uh, that was important to her.

172
00:11:15,651 --> 00:11:19,525
Is it something that matters
to this Kira?

173
00:11:20,997 --> 00:11:23,059
We've never discussed it.

174
00:11:23,102 --> 00:11:25,734
Neither did we... at first.

175
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:33,426
Do our people reproduce?

176
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:36,001
It's more complicated than that.

177
00:11:36,035 --> 00:11:37,368
In our natural state

178
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,809
we don't exist
as separate entities.

179
00:11:39,844 --> 00:11:41,610
I don't understand.

180
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:45,249
Our people spend most
of their time in the Link.

181
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:46,318
The Link?

182
00:11:46,361 --> 00:11:49,927
It involves a melding into one...

183
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:55,143
a merging of thought
and form, idea...

184
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:56,150
and sensation.

185
00:11:56,185 --> 00:11:57,415
You're speaking in riddles.

186
00:11:59,026 --> 00:12:00,724
It's difficult to explain.

187
00:12:00,764 --> 00:12:02,165
Then don't.

188
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,260
Show me.

189
00:12:04,874 --> 00:12:06,434
Of course.

190
00:12:10,789 --> 00:12:12,726
Take it.

191
00:12:45,675 --> 00:12:51,315
For the first time in my life,
I understand...

192
00:12:51,357 --> 00:12:53,225
how I was meant to exist.

193
00:12:56,169 --> 00:12:59,575
You've given up a great deal
to remain here.

194
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,141
Yes.

195
00:13:05,592 --> 00:13:07,027
Yes, I have.

196
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,534
But I won't have anything to do
with the Founders and their war.

197
00:13:12,576 --> 00:13:14,774
Odo...

198
00:13:14,815 --> 00:13:16,547
we linked.

199
00:13:16,619 --> 00:13:18,088
I know the truth.

200
00:13:18,123 --> 00:13:20,729
You stayed here because of Kira.

201
00:13:20,862 --> 00:13:22,958
If it weren't for her

202
00:13:23,001 --> 00:13:26,533
you would be with our people,
war or no war.

203
00:13:26,576 --> 00:13:28,011
You would be...

204
00:13:28,047 --> 00:13:29,573
a Founder.

205
00:13:41,547 --> 00:13:42,846
Hi.

206
00:13:42,884 --> 00:13:45,117
Hello, Nerys.

207
00:13:45,156 --> 00:13:46,386
I can't believe it.

208
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:47,826
Another changeling.

209
00:13:47,863 --> 00:13:49,766
What's he like?

210
00:13:51,606 --> 00:13:53,668
He's...

211
00:13:54,914 --> 00:13:56,782
complicated.

212
00:13:56,819 --> 00:13:58,983
Like you.

213
00:14:01,964 --> 00:14:03,160
You all right?

214
00:14:04,204 --> 00:14:05,332
I'm fine.

215
00:14:07,378 --> 00:14:08,904
You seem far away.

216
00:14:11,121 --> 00:14:13,024
We linked.

217
00:14:14,696 --> 00:14:15,926
I see.

218
00:14:15,966 --> 00:14:17,903
There's nothing to worry about.

219
00:14:17,938 --> 00:14:19,134
He's not a Founder.

220
00:14:19,174 --> 00:14:21,544
He's not trying to lure me
to the Dominion.

221
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,952
The Link is part of what we are.

222
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:28,657
It comes as naturally to us
as talking does to humanoids.

223
00:14:28,698 --> 00:14:32,606
It's a little more personal
than-than talking, isn't it?

224
00:14:34,713 --> 00:14:37,311
I suppose.

225
00:14:37,353 --> 00:14:39,221
So...

226
00:14:39,257 --> 00:14:41,091
do I get to meet him?

227
00:14:42,967 --> 00:14:44,436
If you like.

228
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:45,439
I would.

229
00:14:45,473 --> 00:14:46,965
Then I'll arrange it.

230
00:14:54,729 --> 00:14:56,062
Here they are.

231
00:14:59,976 --> 00:15:02,004
This is Laas.

232
00:15:02,048 --> 00:15:03,449
- Nerys.
- Julian.

233
00:15:03,484 --> 00:15:04,919
- Ezri.
- Miles.

234
00:15:04,955 --> 00:15:06,424
We've met.

235
00:15:06,459 --> 00:15:07,553
Look, I'm sorry.

236
00:15:07,595 --> 00:15:09,566
We didn't know
who you were at first.

237
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,573
You gave us quite a scare
when you rammed the runabout.

238
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:18,954
I've always wondered
how it would feel

239
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:22,226
to be able to fly
through space like that.

240
00:15:22,265 --> 00:15:25,238
It's a shame you're incapable
of ever experiencing it.

241
00:15:25,272 --> 00:15:27,368
Guess so.

242
00:15:28,814 --> 00:15:30,374
Tell us about Varala.

243
00:15:30,419 --> 00:15:32,390
No Federation ship's
ever been there.

244
00:15:32,424 --> 00:15:35,158
It's just the same
as any other planet...

245
00:15:35,197 --> 00:15:36,791
overrun with humanoids

246
00:15:36,834 --> 00:15:38,532
cities and farms everywhere

247
00:15:38,572 --> 00:15:41,876
other life-forms
displaced from their habitats.

248
00:15:41,914 --> 00:15:44,546
Once I migrated
to the southern continent

249
00:15:44,621 --> 00:15:46,090
with a herd of volg.

250
00:15:46,124 --> 00:15:48,562
When we returned
to our breeding grounds

251
00:15:48,664 --> 00:15:51,763
the following summer,
they had been fenced off.

252
00:15:51,805 --> 00:15:54,505
The herd died out
within two generations.

253
00:15:54,546 --> 00:15:57,485
It's always that way
where humanoids thrive.

254
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,219
They disrupt
the natural balance.

255
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,991
Who ordered the vilm-steak?

256
00:16:02,031 --> 00:16:05,301
Uh, um,
you better keep that warm.

257
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,706
Whatever you say.

258
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,346
The truth is I prefer

259
00:16:10,385 --> 00:16:14,088
the so-called
primitive life-forms.

260
00:16:14,127 --> 00:16:17,693
They exist
as they were meant to...

261
00:16:17,737 --> 00:16:19,366
by following...

262
00:16:19,407 --> 00:16:21,571
their instincts.

263
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:25,989
No words get in the way,
no lies, no deceptions.

264
00:16:26,024 --> 00:16:28,120
We're not the ones
who can disguise ourselves

265
00:16:28,162 --> 00:16:29,130
as anything we want.

266
00:16:29,165 --> 00:16:31,603
Meaning?

267
00:16:31,672 --> 00:16:34,874
Meaning shape-shifters
are not to be trusted.

268
00:16:37,586 --> 00:16:39,614
I trust Odo.

269
00:16:39,725 --> 00:16:41,559
Of course, you trust Odo.

270
00:16:41,596 --> 00:16:43,259
Look at him.

271
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:45,830
You've convinced him
that he is as limited

272
00:16:45,874 --> 00:16:47,138
as you are.

273
00:16:47,177 --> 00:16:48,305
Laas...

274
00:16:48,347 --> 00:16:50,580
You've seen through
our evil plan.

275
00:16:50,619 --> 00:16:51,849
Oop. Foiled again.

276
00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:53,188
It's not funny.

277
00:16:53,225 --> 00:16:54,854
No.

278
00:16:54,896 --> 00:16:57,300
I'm very worried for him.

279
00:16:57,336 --> 00:16:59,603
Odo can take care of himself.

280
00:16:59,641 --> 00:17:02,614
Thank you, Colonel.

281
00:17:05,322 --> 00:17:06,951
Well...

282
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:09,487
this has been...

283
00:17:09,532 --> 00:17:11,628
interesting.

284
00:17:11,671 --> 00:17:17,083
If you'll excuse us, Colonel,
Counselor, Doctor, Chief?

285
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,713
Laas?

286
00:17:23,802 --> 00:17:25,237
Nice to see you again.

287
00:17:26,876 --> 00:17:28,938
This way.

288
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,122
Was it really necessary
to insult my friends?

289
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,465
I was merely speaking my mind.

290
00:17:37,502 --> 00:17:38,698
Well, you could call it that.

291
00:17:38,772 --> 00:17:41,142
Humanoids are such
tragic creatures.

292
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:43,651
They've lost the ability
to take joy in simply existing

293
00:17:43,684 --> 00:17:45,814
and yet they haven't
evolved to the next level

294
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:48,625
where consciousness exists
independent of form.

295
00:17:48,664 --> 00:17:51,569
You're certainly not afraid
to make grand generalizations.

296
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:53,575
Well, I've been many
things in my time, Odo.

297
00:17:53,609 --> 00:17:55,341
I speak from experience.

298
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,781
Enough talk.
Link with me.

299
00:17:57,954 --> 00:17:59,514
Here?

300
00:17:59,557 --> 00:18:00,617
Why not?

301
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,858
I don't think
that's a good idea.

302
00:18:02,899 --> 00:18:04,300
Are you embarrassed?

303
00:18:04,336 --> 00:18:06,603
No.

304
00:18:06,642 --> 00:18:08,909
You don't want to do anything
to remind them

305
00:18:08,947 --> 00:18:10,645
that you're not
truly a humanoid.

306
00:18:10,685 --> 00:18:13,351
I don't go out of my way
to point it out, no.

307
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:14,861
Why not?

308
00:18:14,896 --> 00:18:16,730
Are you afraid
they will reject you?

309
00:18:16,767 --> 00:18:19,205
I don't like to confront
people with something

310
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,074
that might make
them uncomfortable.

311
00:18:21,111 --> 00:18:24,848
So, you deny your true nature
in order to fit in?

312
00:18:24,887 --> 00:18:26,915
You're reading too much into it.

313
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:28,326
Before I came here

314
00:18:28,362 --> 00:18:30,857
when was the last time
you assumed another form?

315
00:18:33,409 --> 00:18:35,312
You can't even remember.

316
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,545
You've been pretending
to be a humanoid for so long

317
00:18:38,589 --> 00:18:41,153
it doesn't even occur to you
that you can be anything else.

318
00:18:41,195 --> 00:18:42,163
That's not true.

319
00:18:42,197 --> 00:18:43,393
I've just been involved with...

320
00:18:43,434 --> 00:18:45,564
other things lately.

321
00:18:45,606 --> 00:18:47,235
Like what, courting Kira?

322
00:18:47,277 --> 00:18:48,906
She can't even link with you.

323
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,948
Leave her out of this.

324
00:18:51,989 --> 00:18:53,983
It won't last.

325
00:18:54,027 --> 00:18:56,362
The fact
that your relationship failed

326
00:18:56,399 --> 00:18:58,165
doesn't mean that mine will.

327
00:18:58,204 --> 00:18:59,936
True.

328
00:18:59,975 --> 00:19:01,741
And, if you're very lucky

329
00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:04,308
you can watch her
grow old and die.

330
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:08,624
I think you should stay
out of my affairs.

331
00:19:08,664 --> 00:19:12,800
I don't want to see you
make the same mistakes I made.

332
00:19:12,907 --> 00:19:14,810
You're wasting your time

333
00:19:14,845 --> 00:19:16,907
trying to be a humanoid.

334
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:19,148
You're limiting yourself.

335
00:19:19,189 --> 00:19:21,991
Let's leave here, Odo.

336
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,832
Let's find the others.

337
00:19:24,904 --> 00:19:28,971
100 were sent away
and they're out there...

338
00:19:29,014 --> 00:19:30,540
somewhere.

339
00:19:30,584 --> 00:19:34,321
If we can find even a few of
them, we can form a new Link.

340
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,855
Think of it, Odo.

341
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:40,272
We can exist
the way we were meant to.

342
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:44,176
As changelings.

343
00:19:53,207 --> 00:19:54,836
I can't believe
he actually thought

344
00:19:54,879 --> 00:19:57,112
you'd just drop everything
and leave with him.

345
00:19:59,122 --> 00:20:02,324
He just can't understand
why I want to stay here.

346
00:20:02,364 --> 00:20:04,335
How did he take it
when you said no?

347
00:20:05,906 --> 00:20:09,472
You did say no, didn't you?

348
00:20:09,515 --> 00:20:11,816
I told him I'd think about it.

349
00:20:11,854 --> 00:20:14,258
I didn't want to dismiss
it out of hand.

350
00:20:14,294 --> 00:20:16,026
He would have taken offense.

351
00:20:20,509 --> 00:20:22,776
Why do you look at me like that?

352
00:20:24,652 --> 00:20:27,648
It just... bothers me

353
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:29,688
that he thinks
that you're not happy here.

354
00:20:29,732 --> 00:20:32,705
Makes me think he knows
something that I don't.

355
00:20:33,709 --> 00:20:35,338
What makes you say that?

356
00:20:37,518 --> 00:20:38,987
He linked with you.

357
00:20:39,022 --> 00:20:41,186
Ah.

358
00:20:41,227 --> 00:20:44,724
Something about that
gave him the impression that...

359
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,239
you might want to leave here.

360
00:20:48,579 --> 00:20:51,552
It's just wishful
thinking on his part.

361
00:20:51,587 --> 00:20:53,785
The thought of the two
of us going off together

362
00:20:53,825 --> 00:20:54,885
looking for the others

363
00:20:54,929 --> 00:20:58,165
exploring the galaxy
as changelings...

364
00:20:58,203 --> 00:20:59,866
it's very alluring.

365
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:01,921
To him.

366
00:21:02,054 --> 00:21:04,549
Sounds like it's alluring
to you, too.

367
00:21:04,594 --> 00:21:07,294
I'm... happy...

368
00:21:07,334 --> 00:21:09,066
here.

369
00:21:22,272 --> 00:21:25,440
I'm sorry
I can't link with you.

370
00:21:31,562 --> 00:21:33,465
It doesn't matter, Nerys.

371
00:21:35,639 --> 00:21:37,974
I love you.

372
00:21:58,229 --> 00:22:01,225
Computer, activate
fire suppression sys...

373
00:22:04,979 --> 00:22:06,039
Laas?

374
00:22:09,156 --> 00:22:10,648
I need to talk to you.

375
00:22:15,337 --> 00:22:17,308
You didn't realize it was me.

376
00:22:17,342 --> 00:22:20,144
Did you even know we
could exist as fire?

377
00:22:21,687 --> 00:22:23,247
I didn't think so.

378
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:24,259
No matter.

379
00:22:24,294 --> 00:22:25,888
Once we're away from here

380
00:22:25,931 --> 00:22:29,805
I'll teach you to become things
you've never even dreamed of.

381
00:22:31,044 --> 00:22:32,810
I'm not leaving.

382
00:22:32,847 --> 00:22:34,715
I'm staying here.

383
00:22:34,819 --> 00:22:36,687
Why?

384
00:22:36,724 --> 00:22:40,028
So you can keep on pretending
to be one of them?

385
00:22:40,066 --> 00:22:43,974
I'm sorry
if you're disappointed.

386
00:22:45,914 --> 00:22:47,213
I'll survive.

387
00:22:48,754 --> 00:22:51,021
And when I find
some of the others...

388
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,393
I'll send for you.

389
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,990
You'll change your mind.

390
00:22:54,034 --> 00:22:55,560
You'll join us.

391
00:22:55,605 --> 00:23:01,519
It could take a long time for
you to find another changeling.

392
00:23:01,552 --> 00:23:04,081
Is that supposed
to discourage me?

393
00:23:04,126 --> 00:23:08,695
All I'm saying is you don't have
to leave right away.

394
00:23:08,737 --> 00:23:11,733
I wouldn't mind the company
of another changeling.

395
00:23:11,845 --> 00:23:13,975
I'm sure you
wouldn't mind either.

396
00:23:16,424 --> 00:23:19,363
All right, Odo.

397
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:22,769
I won't abandon you
to these mono-forms.

398
00:23:22,806 --> 00:23:25,176
As a favor to you...

399
00:23:25,212 --> 00:23:26,875
I'll stay a while.

400
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:28,215
Well, you might as well.

401
00:23:28,252 --> 00:23:29,915
If you can't get along with me

402
00:23:29,957 --> 00:23:33,557
what makes you think you can get
along with any other changeling?

403
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:37,405
Just remember, I have
no interest in mono-forms

404
00:23:37,442 --> 00:23:40,176
even if they are your...
friends.

405
00:23:40,216 --> 00:23:42,916
After what happened at Quark's,
I don't think

406
00:23:42,956 --> 00:23:46,328
you have to worry about
an overcrowded social schedule.

407
00:23:46,365 --> 00:23:48,837
Good.

408
00:24:23,324 --> 00:24:24,850
Children, children.

409
00:24:24,894 --> 00:24:26,694
What?

410
00:24:31,043 --> 00:24:34,039
Great. The environmental
system's out again.

411
00:24:34,084 --> 00:24:35,816
There goes our holosuite
reservation.

412
00:24:35,855 --> 00:24:37,415
I better go see
what the problem is.

413
00:24:37,459 --> 00:24:38,587
Don't bother, Chief.

414
00:24:38,629 --> 00:24:40,429
There's nothing wrong with
the environmental system.

415
00:24:40,467 --> 00:24:42,529
Then where's all
this fog coming from?

416
00:24:42,572 --> 00:24:44,041
It's not fog.

417
00:24:44,075 --> 00:24:45,374
It's Laas.

418
00:24:45,412 --> 00:24:46,711
Laas?

419
00:24:46,749 --> 00:24:48,447
What's he doing?

420
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,751
Being fog.

421
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,384
What's it look like?

422
00:24:51,427 --> 00:24:53,193
Can't he be fog somewhere else?

423
00:24:53,232 --> 00:24:55,135
Or at night
when nobody's around?

424
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,936
He's not hurting anyone.

425
00:24:57,041 --> 00:24:57,940
Still...

426
00:24:58,044 --> 00:24:59,479
it's kind of creepy.

427
00:24:59,514 --> 00:25:00,813
Careful, Miles.

428
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,183
He might hear you.

429
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,246
Good.

430
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,073
Laas?

431
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,116
Laas.

432
00:25:35,637 --> 00:25:39,340
Well... congratulations.

433
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:43,083
You've managed to disrupt
the entire Promenade.

434
00:25:43,122 --> 00:25:44,785
I was just relaxing.

435
00:25:44,827 --> 00:25:47,858
If you want to relax,
do it in private.

436
00:25:47,902 --> 00:25:50,431
Did I embarrass you?

437
00:25:50,474 --> 00:25:52,342
<i>Ka'vek!</i>

438
00:25:52,379 --> 00:25:54,543
What is this Founder doing here?

439
00:25:54,585 --> 00:25:55,918
He's not a Founder.

440
00:25:55,955 --> 00:25:57,015
Now, move along.

441
00:25:57,124 --> 00:25:59,824
Don't change form
in my presence again.

442
00:25:59,865 --> 00:26:02,235
I will change form
where I please.

443
00:26:03,842 --> 00:26:04,810
Look at him.

444
00:26:04,844 --> 00:26:06,177
Look at the hate in his eyes.

445
00:26:06,214 --> 00:26:07,740
Laas.

446
00:26:07,784 --> 00:26:10,689
Your hands are stained with
the blood of Klingon warriors.

447
00:26:10,725 --> 00:26:13,927
But then the stench
would still be on them.

448
00:26:13,967 --> 00:26:15,527
<i>P'tak!</i>

449
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:16,869
Mine's bigger.

450
00:26:16,907 --> 00:26:18,103
<i>Ke'chaw!</i>

451
00:26:18,144 --> 00:26:18,839
No.

452
00:26:26,497 --> 00:26:28,091
No!

453
00:26:38,829 --> 00:26:41,860
Dr. Bashir wasn't able
to save the Klingon's life.

454
00:26:41,903 --> 00:26:45,469
General Martok
has asked that Laas be detained

455
00:26:45,512 --> 00:26:47,676
until the magistrate
can determine jurisdiction.

456
00:26:47,717 --> 00:26:48,616
Jurisdiction?

457
00:26:48,653 --> 00:26:49,552
The Klingons

458
00:26:49,589 --> 00:26:50,819
want to extradite him.

459
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:51,827
That's ridiculous.

460
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:53,228
He killed that Klingon
in self-defense.

461
00:26:53,265 --> 00:26:54,666
That is in dispute.

462
00:26:54,702 --> 00:26:56,673
He was about to draw
his disrupter.

463
00:26:56,707 --> 00:26:59,544
According to the other Klingon,
he was reaching for his dagger.

464
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:02,041
Are you saying that's not true?

465
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,356
It all happened too fast, but
their intentions were obvious.

466
00:27:05,395 --> 00:27:07,024
One of them put a knife
in his chest.

467
00:27:07,065 --> 00:27:08,295
The Klingons are arguing

468
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,773
that since Laas knew
he couldn't be harmed by a knife

469
00:27:10,808 --> 00:27:14,271
that he wasn't justified
in responding with deadly force.

470
00:27:14,317 --> 00:27:17,256
Since when do the Klingons
resort to legal quibbling?

471
00:27:17,292 --> 00:27:19,456
They get involved in fights
all the time.

472
00:27:19,497 --> 00:27:20,796
They never file charges.

473
00:27:20,833 --> 00:27:22,325
It isn't honorable.

474
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:23,669
In this case, the Klingons

475
00:27:23,707 --> 00:27:25,940
are exercising their rights
under the law.

476
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,917
Sir, they are only doing this

477
00:27:27,951 --> 00:27:30,651
because they distrust
changelings.

478
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:32,252
He should not have
provoked them.

479
00:27:32,295 --> 00:27:33,457
Provoked them?

480
00:27:33,498 --> 00:27:35,696
They attacked Laas.

481
00:27:37,107 --> 00:27:40,479
They claim he surrounded them
menacingly.

482
00:27:41,518 --> 00:27:44,981
They felt menaced by fog.

483
00:27:45,027 --> 00:27:46,621
They weren't the only ones.

484
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,502
There are 12 other people
who filed complaints.

485
00:27:49,538 --> 00:27:53,412
Is it a crime to shape-shift
on the Promenade?

486
00:27:53,448 --> 00:27:57,185
It's not a crime, but it's
obviously not a good idea.

487
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:59,990
You're going to allow
the Klingons to extradite him

488
00:28:00,032 --> 00:28:02,230
knowing they won't give him
a fair trial.

489
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:03,671
That's not my decision.

490
00:28:03,707 --> 00:28:05,040
It's up to the magistrate.

491
00:28:05,077 --> 00:28:06,740
But you'd just as soon
be rid of him.

492
00:28:06,782 --> 00:28:09,117
You never wanted him on the
station in the first place.

493
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:10,350
I practically had to beg you

494
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,477
to let him
out of that holding cell.

495
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,604
That's quite enough, Constable.

496
00:28:16,188 --> 00:28:18,182
Now, Martok has expressed
some concerns

497
00:28:18,227 --> 00:28:19,959
about our security arrangements.

498
00:28:21,435 --> 00:28:22,665
Meaning?

499
00:28:22,704 --> 00:28:24,230
He's not sure it's appropriate

500
00:28:24,275 --> 00:28:26,645
that you should be
in charge of the prisoner.

501
00:28:29,622 --> 00:28:31,422
May I ask why?

502
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,957
Because you were a witness
to the alleged crime.

503
00:28:35,002 --> 00:28:37,600
Well, that's a relief.

504
00:28:37,642 --> 00:28:41,744
For a moment, I thought you were
going to say it's because...

505
00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:43,949
I'm a changeling.

506
00:28:58,795 --> 00:29:00,595
Odo.

507
00:29:00,632 --> 00:29:02,033
I heard about your friend.

508
00:29:02,069 --> 00:29:05,100
Rumor has it the Klingons
want to put him on trial.

509
00:29:05,144 --> 00:29:07,308
They're the ones who
should be put on trial.

510
00:29:07,349 --> 00:29:09,753
If they'd attacked anyone
other than a changeling

511
00:29:09,822 --> 00:29:10,950
they would be.

512
00:29:10,992 --> 00:29:12,256
You're probably right.

513
00:29:13,732 --> 00:29:16,569
That fog episode certainly
didn't help matters.

514
00:29:16,605 --> 00:29:20,046
Laas was only doing
what comes naturally to us.

515
00:29:20,081 --> 00:29:22,645
You never pulled
a stunt like that.

516
00:29:22,687 --> 00:29:24,783
You're smart enough to know
that people don't want

517
00:29:24,893 --> 00:29:26,625
to be reminded
that you're different.

518
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:30,436
Who wants to see
somebody turn into goo?

519
00:29:30,474 --> 00:29:32,946
I hope you don't do that
around Kira.

520
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,643
Why shouldn't I?

521
00:29:34,684 --> 00:29:38,524
Well, if she's anything like me,
she'd rather you didn't.

522
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,052
Don't you get it, Odo?

523
00:29:40,097 --> 00:29:41,829
We humanoids are a product

524
00:29:41,869 --> 00:29:44,204
of millions of years
of evolution.

525
00:29:44,242 --> 00:29:45,711
Our ancestors learned
the hard way

526
00:29:45,745 --> 00:29:48,240
that what you don't know
might kill you.

527
00:29:48,285 --> 00:29:50,415
They wouldn't have survived
if they hadn't have jumped back

528
00:29:50,457 --> 00:29:52,325
when they encountered
a snake coiled in the muck.

529
00:29:52,362 --> 00:29:53,956
And, now,
millions of years later

530
00:29:53,999 --> 00:29:55,970
that instinct is still there.

531
00:29:56,004 --> 00:29:57,633
It's genetic.

532
00:29:57,675 --> 00:30:01,047
Our tolerance to other
life-forms doesn't extend

533
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:04,079
beyond the two-arm,
two-leg variety.

534
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,960
I hate to break this to you...

535
00:30:08,268 --> 00:30:10,866
but when you're
in your natural state...

536
00:30:10,908 --> 00:30:15,010
you're more than
our poor old genes can handle.

537
00:30:15,052 --> 00:30:17,353
So what are you saying, Quark?

538
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,919
That the Klingons
couldn't help what they did

539
00:30:19,997 --> 00:30:21,125
because of their genes?

540
00:30:21,167 --> 00:30:24,038
I'm not trying to excuse
what they did.

541
00:30:24,074 --> 00:30:27,310
I'm only telling you
why it happened.

542
00:30:27,349 --> 00:30:28,784
Watch your step, Odo.

543
00:30:28,819 --> 00:30:30,847
We're at war with your people.

544
00:30:30,891 --> 00:30:33,124
This is no time

545
00:30:33,163 --> 00:30:36,935
for a changeling pride
demonstration on the Promenade.

546
00:30:56,288 --> 00:30:58,259
Constable.

547
00:30:58,293 --> 00:30:59,261
I'd like to have

548
00:30:59,295 --> 00:31:00,924
a few minutes alone
with the prisoner.

549
00:31:00,967 --> 00:31:02,436
Sorry, sir.

550
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,939
I have my orders.

551
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:21,608
I don't know what to say.

552
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:23,348
You could say you were wrong.

553
00:31:23,389 --> 00:31:25,793
You could say the people here

554
00:31:25,828 --> 00:31:28,300
are no different
than any other humanoids.

555
00:31:29,671 --> 00:31:31,403
Hopefully, this will all

556
00:31:31,442 --> 00:31:33,470
get straightened out
at your hearing.

557
00:31:33,514 --> 00:31:37,046
I am sure it will be
fair and impartial.

558
00:31:37,157 --> 00:31:40,222
Just tell them
exactly what happened.

559
00:31:41,835 --> 00:31:44,307
My word against a humanoid's.

560
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,038
Whom do you think
this magistrate

561
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:47,139
is going to believe?

562
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:53,190
I shouldn't have
convinced you to stay.

563
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:56,534
If I had just... let you go

564
00:31:56,572 --> 00:31:57,973
none of this
would have happened.

565
00:31:58,008 --> 00:32:00,241
My only consolation

566
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,048
is that this may
finally make you understand

567
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:05,822
that you don't belong here.

568
00:32:05,862 --> 00:32:09,895
You saw the hatred
in that Klingon's eyes.

569
00:32:09,938 --> 00:32:11,704
Perhaps now you'll recognize it

570
00:32:11,743 --> 00:32:13,839
when you see it
hiding in the faces

571
00:32:13,882 --> 00:32:17,323
of your so-called friends.

572
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:23,900
They tolerate you, Odo...

573
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,104
because you emulate them.

574
00:32:26,212 --> 00:32:28,376
What higher flattery is there?

575
00:32:28,418 --> 00:32:31,756
"I, who can be anything,
choose to be like you."

576
00:32:31,793 --> 00:32:35,131
But even when you make yourself
in their image

577
00:32:35,168 --> 00:32:38,073
they know you are not truly
one of them.

578
00:32:38,108 --> 00:32:41,571
They know that what you appear
to be does not reflect

579
00:32:41,617 --> 00:32:44,249
what you really are.

580
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:46,990
It's only a mask.

581
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:50,026
What lies underneath

582
00:32:50,072 --> 00:32:53,045
is alien to them

583
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:55,916
and so they fear it.

584
00:32:55,953 --> 00:32:59,086
And that fear can turn to hate

585
00:32:59,127 --> 00:33:01,121
in the blink of an eye.

586
00:33:05,243 --> 00:33:06,712
They're going to extradite him.

587
00:33:06,747 --> 00:33:08,148
You don't know that.

588
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:10,984
Yes, I do, and no one is going
to do anything to stop it.

589
00:33:11,024 --> 00:33:12,516
There's not much anyone can do.

590
00:33:12,561 --> 00:33:13,860
If he weren't a changeling

591
00:33:13,898 --> 00:33:15,869
the Captain would find
a way to intervene.

592
00:33:15,903 --> 00:33:17,031
Oh, no, that's unfair.

593
00:33:17,072 --> 00:33:18,166
Is it?

594
00:33:18,242 --> 00:33:20,475
You're starting
to sound like Laas.

595
00:33:20,515 --> 00:33:21,848
Well, maybe that's
because I'm starting

596
00:33:21,885 --> 00:33:23,354
to see things more clearly now.

597
00:33:23,388 --> 00:33:24,857
What is that supposed to mean?

598
00:33:24,892 --> 00:33:27,330
Look at me, Nerys.
What do you see?

599
00:33:27,365 --> 00:33:28,333
I see you.

600
00:33:28,367 --> 00:33:33,642
No. No, this is just
a form I borrowed.

601
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,916
I could just as easily be
someone or something else.

602
00:33:36,955 --> 00:33:38,083
I know that

603
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:40,825
but this...

604
00:33:40,865 --> 00:33:44,431
is what you have
always chosen to be.

605
00:33:45,443 --> 00:33:47,037
A man...

606
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,917
a good and honest man...

607
00:33:49,955 --> 00:33:53,487
a man I fell in love with.

608
00:33:54,967 --> 00:33:58,305
Are you trying to tell me
that he never really existed?

609
00:34:00,213 --> 00:34:01,512
I don't know.

610
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:10,134
I care for you

611
00:34:10,172 --> 00:34:11,835
more than anyone
I've ever known.

612
00:34:11,875 --> 00:34:15,578
These last few months have
been the happiest of my life.

613
00:34:15,618 --> 00:34:17,714
But even so...

614
00:34:17,757 --> 00:34:21,220
part of me wishes that Laas
and I were out there right now

615
00:34:21,266 --> 00:34:22,860
searching for the others

616
00:34:22,903 --> 00:34:25,170
existing as changelings.

617
00:34:25,209 --> 00:34:27,271
Because that's what I am.

618
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,750
Not a humanoid.

619
00:34:28,785 --> 00:34:31,086
I'm a changeling.

620
00:34:33,162 --> 00:34:35,999
Well, then maybe you're right.

621
00:34:36,036 --> 00:34:38,371
Maybe you do belong out there.

622
00:35:00,263 --> 00:35:01,961
Can I help you, Colonel?

623
00:35:02,001 --> 00:35:03,630
Uh... I need to talk
to the prisoner.

624
00:35:03,672 --> 00:35:04,971
Alone.

625
00:35:05,008 --> 00:35:07,002
Aye, sir.

626
00:35:27,598 --> 00:35:30,537
Go to the third planet
in the Koralis system.

627
00:35:30,572 --> 00:35:32,543
You'll find an orbital tether

628
00:35:32,577 --> 00:35:34,947
running down to
an abandoned mining complex.

629
00:35:34,983 --> 00:35:37,011
I'll tell Odo to meet you there.

630
00:35:37,055 --> 00:35:40,188
Is this some kind of a trick?

631
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,833
Do you want to get out of here
or not?

632
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:49,781
That vent will lead you through
some conduits to an airlock.

633
00:35:52,526 --> 00:35:53,688
Why?

634
00:35:55,701 --> 00:35:57,364
I love him.

635
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:10,031
Escaped?

636
00:36:13,311 --> 00:36:15,544
How did he get through
the containment field?

637
00:36:15,584 --> 00:36:16,814
I can't explain it.

638
00:36:16,854 --> 00:36:18,323
All I can tell you
is what I saw.

639
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:20,386
He turned into some kind
of plasma energy

640
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:21,796
and forced his way through.

641
00:36:21,833 --> 00:36:23,531
Before I could stop him,
he had disappeared

642
00:36:23,571 --> 00:36:24,539
into the air vent.

643
00:36:24,573 --> 00:36:26,008
According to the operations log

644
00:36:26,111 --> 00:36:28,709
one of the airlocks was
activated shortly after that.

645
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,014
If he left the station

646
00:36:30,086 --> 00:36:32,023
why didn't our sensors
detect him?

647
00:36:32,058 --> 00:36:34,587
A Corvallen freighter was
leaving about the same time.

648
00:36:34,631 --> 00:36:37,799
He must have shadowed it
to keep from being spotted.

649
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:39,639
He could be anywhere by now.

650
00:36:39,677 --> 00:36:42,241
General Martok is not going
to be happy about this.

651
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:45,257
By fleeing, the changeling
has demonstrated his guilt.

652
00:36:45,291 --> 00:36:48,925
Either that, or his lack of
faith in our justice system.

653
00:36:48,967 --> 00:36:51,804
He must be apprehended
and brought to trial.

654
00:36:51,841 --> 00:36:54,473
Mr. Worf,
have all available runabouts

655
00:36:54,514 --> 00:36:56,485
begin a sector-wide search.

656
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:58,422
Aye, sir.

657
00:36:58,458 --> 00:37:00,429
Good luck.

658
00:37:00,463 --> 00:37:02,297
Constable, I know
it's a long shot

659
00:37:02,334 --> 00:37:04,305
but I'm sure you can agree

660
00:37:04,339 --> 00:37:07,312
we should do everything we can
to find him.

661
00:37:07,346 --> 00:37:09,340
Of course.

662
00:37:09,384 --> 00:37:11,355
Dismissed.

663
00:37:27,429 --> 00:37:29,423
Level 9.

664
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:38,517
You didn't hide it very well...

665
00:37:38,558 --> 00:37:42,466
that you're glad he escaped.

666
00:37:42,501 --> 00:37:45,099
I should have known
he'd be able to escape.

667
00:37:45,141 --> 00:37:46,371
What's a force field

668
00:37:46,411 --> 00:37:48,575
to a changeling
with his abilities?

669
00:37:50,821 --> 00:37:55,093
You said you wished you
were out there with him.

670
00:37:55,132 --> 00:37:57,330
Well, it's not too late.

671
00:37:57,371 --> 00:37:59,433
I don't understand.

672
00:37:59,476 --> 00:38:03,316
He's waiting for you at an
abandoned mine on Koralis III.

673
00:38:06,661 --> 00:38:09,863
You... helped him escape?

674
00:38:09,902 --> 00:38:12,670
I don't want you
to stay here under some...

675
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:14,805
sense of obligation.

676
00:38:21,064 --> 00:38:23,058
Good luck.

677
00:38:30,253 --> 00:38:33,090
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

678
00:39:10,186 --> 00:39:12,180
Laas?

679
00:39:15,767 --> 00:39:17,897
I knew you would come.

680
00:39:19,509 --> 00:39:22,346
This is a new beginning
for us, Odo

681
00:39:22,384 --> 00:39:25,688
a new beginning for our people.

682
00:39:25,725 --> 00:39:31,194
You and I are about to embark
on the adventure of our lives.

683
00:39:32,876 --> 00:39:34,972
What's wrong?

684
00:39:35,014 --> 00:39:37,178
I'm not going with you.

685
00:39:41,097 --> 00:39:43,592
Why are you here?

686
00:39:43,636 --> 00:39:46,438
I've come to say good-bye.

687
00:39:46,477 --> 00:39:49,279
Don't be a fool.

688
00:39:49,317 --> 00:39:50,786
What are you holding on to?

689
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:51,811
Kira?

690
00:39:51,857 --> 00:39:54,489
Even she knows that this
is what's best for you.

691
00:39:54,531 --> 00:39:57,197
Why else would she have
helped me to escape?

692
00:39:57,237 --> 00:40:00,507
You really don't know, do you?

693
00:40:00,546 --> 00:40:02,676
You've no idea what it means

694
00:40:02,717 --> 00:40:06,591
to love someone enough
to let them go.

695
00:40:06,627 --> 00:40:08,359
She let you go

696
00:40:08,465 --> 00:40:12,099
so that you could find out
where you belong.

697
00:40:12,141 --> 00:40:14,374
I know where I belong.

698
00:40:14,413 --> 00:40:15,712
Laas...

699
00:40:15,749 --> 00:40:19,155
humanoids are not
the petty, limited creatures

700
00:40:19,192 --> 00:40:20,491
you perceive them to be.

701
00:40:20,529 --> 00:40:25,030
What Nerys did should
prove that, even to you.

702
00:40:25,073 --> 00:40:28,309
Love conquers all.
Is that it?

703
00:40:30,152 --> 00:40:33,057
I'm sorry you can't understand.

704
00:40:33,093 --> 00:40:35,622
You've done many things

705
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:38,697
been many things...

706
00:40:38,741 --> 00:40:42,409
but you've never known love.

707
00:40:42,449 --> 00:40:44,750
Compared to the Link

708
00:40:44,789 --> 00:40:47,660
it is a pale shadow

709
00:40:47,696 --> 00:40:51,000
a feeble attempt to compensate
for the isolation

710
00:40:51,038 --> 00:40:52,598
that mono-forms feel

711
00:40:52,642 --> 00:40:56,048
because they are trapped
within themselves.

712
00:40:56,084 --> 00:40:58,989
Perhaps the fact
that it's not easy

713
00:40:59,024 --> 00:41:01,792
is what makes it worthwhile.

714
00:41:01,831 --> 00:41:03,529
Odo...

715
00:41:03,569 --> 00:41:06,064
the Founders are dying.

716
00:41:06,109 --> 00:41:09,014
This could be your last chance

717
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:12,455
to exist the way
you were meant to.

718
00:41:13,561 --> 00:41:15,794
Don't throw it away.

719
00:41:17,169 --> 00:41:18,570
You'd better go.

720
00:41:18,607 --> 00:41:20,167
They're looking for you.

721
00:41:22,951 --> 00:41:24,785
Good luck.

722
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:33,509
And to you, Odo.

723
00:41:33,611 --> 00:41:35,741
You'll need it more than I.

724
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:01,606
Watch over him.

725
00:42:01,647 --> 00:42:04,484
Help him find his way.

726
00:42:07,127 --> 00:42:09,121
Yes.

727
00:42:18,089 --> 00:42:20,561
I didn't think
I'd see you again.

728
00:42:20,594 --> 00:42:23,932
I couldn't go.

729
00:42:36,467 --> 00:42:41,708
If I ever made you feel that you
couldn't be yourself with me...

730
00:42:41,747 --> 00:42:43,741
I'm sorry.

731
00:42:45,657 --> 00:42:47,651
I want to know you...

732
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:51,900
the way you really are.
