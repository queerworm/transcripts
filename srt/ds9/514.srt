1
00:00:14,887 --> 00:00:16,857
Where do you want me
to put this?

2
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:18,918
Anywhere you can find room.

3
00:00:21,734 --> 00:00:24,102
I bet you can't wait
to put all this together

4
00:00:24,139 --> 00:00:26,609
so you can start shape-shifting
around the room again.

5
00:00:26,644 --> 00:00:28,044
Oh, I suppose.

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,448
Though I did enjoy
sleeping in a bed.

7
00:00:30,484 --> 00:00:31,577
Well, there's nothing

8
00:00:31,621 --> 00:00:33,318
to stop you from sleeping
in a bed if you want to.

9
00:00:33,357 --> 00:00:35,088
Except that now when I'm asleep

10
00:00:35,127 --> 00:00:37,188
I tend to revert
to my gelatinous state

11
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:39,497
and slide onto the floor.

12
00:00:39,536 --> 00:00:41,665
No, the bed goes.

13
00:00:41,707 --> 00:00:43,141
I'm a changeling, not a solid.

14
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:44,942
There's no use
pretending otherwise.

15
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,813
I guess we can put
all this in storage.

16
00:00:46,851 --> 00:00:48,912
What about these padds?

17
00:00:48,955 --> 00:00:49,980
Uh...

18
00:00:50,024 --> 00:00:51,253
<i>Finding and Winning</i>
<i>Your Perfect Mate</i>

19
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:52,827
by Doctor Jennings Rain.

20
00:00:52,863 --> 00:00:54,058
I'll take that.

21
00:00:54,098 --> 00:00:55,795
I thought I was going

22
00:00:55,836 --> 00:00:58,238
to be a humanoid
for the rest of my life.

23
00:01:00,177 --> 00:01:03,445
There were certain things...

24
00:01:03,484 --> 00:01:05,249
You don't have to explain, Odo.

25
00:01:07,258 --> 00:01:09,957
I only read
the first three chapters.

26
00:01:09,997 --> 00:01:11,830
Maybe you should finish it.

27
00:01:11,868 --> 00:01:13,234
Why waste my time?

28
00:01:13,337 --> 00:01:15,534
Romance is for solids.

29
00:01:15,574 --> 00:01:18,705
Well, you are a solid,
18 hours a day.

30
00:01:19,984 --> 00:01:21,920
I'm sure there are plenty
of women on this station

31
00:01:21,954 --> 00:01:24,220
who would be
very interested in you

32
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:25,990
if you gave them a chance.

33
00:01:26,029 --> 00:01:28,592
I'll keep that in mind, Major.

34
00:01:28,635 --> 00:01:32,268
Right now, I'd be satisfied
just getting this room in order.

35
00:01:32,341 --> 00:01:34,277
Dax to Kira and Odo.

36
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:35,974
Go ahead, Commander.

37
00:01:36,016 --> 00:01:38,384
There's something we'd like you
to take a look at in Ops.

38
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,083
We're on our way.

39
00:01:51,814 --> 00:01:54,479
One of our listening posts
in the Gamma Quadrant

40
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:56,216
picked this up
a few minutes ago.

41
00:01:56,256 --> 00:01:58,226
It looks like
a Cardassian military code

42
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,127
but the computer
doesn't recognize it.

43
00:02:00,164 --> 00:02:01,997
Oh, it's Cardassian, all right.

44
00:02:02,034 --> 00:02:03,936
But I didn't think
there were any Cardassians

45
00:02:03,972 --> 00:02:05,201
in the Gamma Quadrant.

46
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,265
None that we know of.

47
00:02:06,343 --> 00:02:07,276
Not Elgol-red

48
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:10,373
or Fifth Order
Military Encryption.

49
00:02:10,417 --> 00:02:12,614
Try Courier Code Five-Nine.

50
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:17,197
Strange.

51
00:02:17,231 --> 00:02:18,460
Most Cardassian codes

52
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,629
use a recursive
encryption algorithm

53
00:02:20,672 --> 00:02:23,439
but this has a completely
different coding system.

54
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,504
Bajoran Intelligence
has a lot of experience

55
00:02:25,547 --> 00:02:26,776
breaking Cardassian codes.

56
00:02:26,817 --> 00:02:28,217
Why don't you send it to them?

57
00:02:28,253 --> 00:02:29,847
We did, as soon as it came in.

58
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,655
We still haven't
heard from them.

59
00:02:31,694 --> 00:02:32,923
It may take some time.

60
00:02:32,963 --> 00:02:34,261
If someone's sending

61
00:02:34,298 --> 00:02:36,791
coded Cardassian messages
from the Gamma Quadrant

62
00:02:36,837 --> 00:02:39,137
I want to know
what they're saying, now.

63
00:02:39,175 --> 00:02:42,011
We do have an expert
in Cardassian codes

64
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:44,280
living on the station.

65
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:45,650
You're right.

66
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:47,454
Dax, get me Mr. Garak.

67
00:02:50,531 --> 00:02:52,364
It's good to see you
again, Cara.

68
00:02:52,401 --> 00:02:55,703
I'm sorry for the interruption.

69
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:57,371
Well, how did it go?

70
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:58,971
I'm afraid I disappointed them.

71
00:02:59,015 --> 00:03:01,680
I think they were hoping
that the message they picked up

72
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:04,021
would contain the key
to defeating the Dominion.

73
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,755
You should have seen
the looks on their faces

74
00:03:05,795 --> 00:03:07,662
when I explained
to them that it was

75
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:09,828
a five-year-old
planetary survey report.

76
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,897
A planetary survey report?

77
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,877
That's the look, exactly.

78
00:03:13,911 --> 00:03:17,612
I would have thought you'd be
a little disappointed, too.

79
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:19,621
After all, it could have been
from one of the survivors

80
00:03:19,655 --> 00:03:22,023
of the Cardassian fleet that
was lost in the Gamma Quadrant.

81
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:23,359
Oh, I'd given up hope

82
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,559
of ever finding any trace
of them long ago.

83
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:26,728
Really?

84
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:28,764
I never saw you
as the giving-up type.

85
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:32,373
There comes a time when one
must face reality, my dear.

86
00:03:32,481 --> 00:03:35,749
Those people are gone
and are never coming back.

87
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:38,556
Well... my young friends

88
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,392
I'd like to stay here
and chat all day

89
00:03:40,497 --> 00:03:43,128
but I have dresses to make,
trousers to mend.

90
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:46,837
It's a full life,
if a trifle banal.

91
00:03:46,877 --> 00:03:50,281
And do tell Captain Sisko
that I'd be more than happy

92
00:03:50,317 --> 00:03:54,553
to decode any Cardassian laundry
lists that come across his desk.

93
00:03:54,592 --> 00:03:55,821
My dear.

94
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:04,373
My father would be furious
to hear me say this

95
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:07,712
but... there's something
about Garak I find...

96
00:04:07,752 --> 00:04:09,015
fascinating.

97
00:04:09,055 --> 00:04:11,116
Yes, he has his moments.

98
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,143
Going somewhere?

99
00:06:37,324 --> 00:06:40,455
I really must remember to stop
underestimating you, Doctor.

100
00:06:40,497 --> 00:06:42,330
How did you know?

101
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:43,562
You mean, that you were lying

102
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:45,037
about the contents
of the message?

103
00:06:45,073 --> 00:06:47,601
You said you'd given up
on the Cardassian survivors

104
00:06:47,644 --> 00:06:49,409
who were lost
in the Gamma Quadrant.

105
00:06:49,448 --> 00:06:50,882
Well, Ziyal was right.

106
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:53,081
You're not the giving-up sort.

107
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:54,648
Very good, Doctor.

108
00:06:54,758 --> 00:06:57,491
You've come a long way

109
00:06:57,531 --> 00:07:00,435
from the naive young man
I met five years ago.

110
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:03,931
You've become distrustful
and suspicious.

111
00:07:03,977 --> 00:07:05,206
It suits you.

112
00:07:05,246 --> 00:07:06,646
I had a good teacher.

113
00:07:08,653 --> 00:07:11,216
What did the message
really say, Garak?

114
00:07:11,258 --> 00:07:14,560
It was a call for help...

115
00:07:14,598 --> 00:07:16,066
from Enabran Tain.

116
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,072
Tain?

117
00:07:18,106 --> 00:07:20,907
But you said you'd seen his ship
destroyed by the Dominion.

118
00:07:20,945 --> 00:07:24,042
I did, but Tain was head of
the Obsidian Order for 20 years.

119
00:07:24,084 --> 00:07:26,577
If he can survive that,
he can survive anything.

120
00:07:26,622 --> 00:07:28,819
I have to find him, Doctor.

121
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,659
I owe it to him.

122
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,198
You don't owe Tain anything.

123
00:07:32,234 --> 00:07:33,931
He had you exiled
from Cardassia.

124
00:07:33,971 --> 00:07:37,273
Yes, but, aside from that,
we were very close.

125
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:40,146
He was... my mentor

126
00:07:40,183 --> 00:07:42,483
and I'm not going
to turn my back on him.

127
00:07:42,521 --> 00:07:45,459
If it'll make you feel any
better, you can come with me.

128
00:07:45,493 --> 00:07:48,397
All you have to do
is come up with an excuse

129
00:07:48,432 --> 00:07:51,666
why you need the runabout,
and we could leave immediately.

130
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:54,005
So, let me get this straight.

131
00:07:54,044 --> 00:07:56,948
You want me to lie
to my commanding officer

132
00:07:56,983 --> 00:07:59,453
violate Starfleet regulations

133
00:07:59,488 --> 00:08:02,654
and go with you on a mission
into the Gamma Quadrant

134
00:08:02,727 --> 00:08:04,253
which will probably
get us both killed.

135
00:08:04,298 --> 00:08:06,666
I'm ready when you are.

136
00:08:06,702 --> 00:08:08,399
In that case...

137
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:09,429
let's go.

138
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,871
To Captain Sisko's office.

139
00:08:15,887 --> 00:08:19,382
How do you know
that the message isn't a fake?

140
00:08:19,428 --> 00:08:21,864
That it was really sent by Tain?

141
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:24,894
The code sequence was
personally designed

142
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:25,963
by Tain and myself.

143
00:08:26,008 --> 00:08:27,203
No one else knows it.

144
00:08:27,244 --> 00:08:30,080
Now, somehow he got
that message out

145
00:08:30,116 --> 00:08:33,054
and I have to follow it
back to its source.

146
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:36,084
Did the message contain
any coordinates?

147
00:08:36,128 --> 00:08:37,722
No. Most of it
was identification code.

148
00:08:37,764 --> 00:08:40,064
The rest of it
was just one word, "alive,"

149
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,096
repeated over and over again.

150
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,739
So it should be easy enough
to triangulate the source.

151
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:49,184
Captain...
Tain might not be alone.

152
00:08:49,221 --> 00:08:50,655
There could be others.

153
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,626
Troops from the
Cardassian-Romulan fleet

154
00:08:52,661 --> 00:08:56,226
survivors from the Dominion
attack on New Bajor

155
00:08:56,268 --> 00:08:58,967
and even crew members
from those Federation ships

156
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:02,274
that disappeared
in the Gamma Quadrant.

157
00:09:02,314 --> 00:09:05,480
This is a mission of mercy.

158
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,581
You can't ignore it.

159
00:09:07,624 --> 00:09:12,031
I'm still not totally convinced
that it's a genuine message.

160
00:09:12,067 --> 00:09:15,403
But I suppose there's
only one way to find out.

161
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,910
Captain, you can't let him go.

162
00:09:17,944 --> 00:09:19,173
It's too dangerous.

163
00:09:19,214 --> 00:09:20,682
Your concern is touching, Doctor

164
00:09:20,717 --> 00:09:24,019
but I assure you,
I can take care of myself.

165
00:09:24,056 --> 00:09:26,049
Maybe you can, but you're
still not going alone.

166
00:09:26,095 --> 00:09:28,463
Doctor?

167
00:09:28,499 --> 00:09:29,899
I think you've just volunteered.

168
00:09:29,935 --> 00:09:32,702
Dr. Bashir isn't going anywhere.

169
00:09:33,943 --> 00:09:36,779
But I do have
someone else in mind.

170
00:09:36,882 --> 00:09:39,410
I don't know
what makes me angrier...

171
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:40,422
that you agreed to go

172
00:09:40,456 --> 00:09:43,223
into the Gamma Quadrant
with Garak

173
00:09:43,262 --> 00:09:46,598
or that I had to hear it
from Sisko.

174
00:09:46,635 --> 00:09:48,035
I was going to tell you.

175
00:09:48,071 --> 00:09:50,303
When?
On your way out the airlock?

176
00:09:50,343 --> 00:09:52,370
A Klingon warrior
does not have to explain

177
00:09:52,414 --> 00:09:55,818
why he chooses to face danger,
not even to his <i>par'machkai.</i>

178
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,519
So in other words, you were
afraid I'd make a scene.

179
00:09:59,561 --> 00:10:03,160
That I'd embarrass you,
maybe even cry.

180
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:05,935
You are capable of anything.

181
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:07,499
Don't worry, Worf.

182
00:10:07,544 --> 00:10:09,810
I won't be shedding any tears
over you.

183
00:10:09,848 --> 00:10:12,979
Ah. Then you came to wish me
a good death in battle.

184
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:16,186
No.

185
00:10:16,228 --> 00:10:18,027
I came for these.

186
00:10:26,782 --> 00:10:28,308
My Klingon operas.

187
00:10:28,352 --> 00:10:31,222
Well, you won't be using them
for the next few days.

188
00:10:31,258 --> 00:10:32,726
Somebody might as well
enjoy them.

189
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:43,712
What?

190
00:10:45,118 --> 00:10:46,849
Something wrong?

191
00:10:48,826 --> 00:10:52,196
You have a tendency
to misplace things.

192
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:57,073
And you're afraid
that I might... lose

193
00:10:57,109 --> 00:10:58,703
your precious operas?

194
00:11:00,249 --> 00:11:01,376
Yes.

195
00:11:02,587 --> 00:11:04,682
It's a distinct possibility.

196
00:11:04,724 --> 00:11:08,185
If I were you, I'd hurry back.

197
00:11:08,232 --> 00:11:12,138
That is, if you want to keep
your collection intact.

198
00:11:20,489 --> 00:11:23,427
Have a glorious death...
or don't.

199
00:11:23,462 --> 00:11:25,364
It's up to you.

200
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,057
The Gamma Quadrant?

201
00:11:43,101 --> 00:11:45,629
You can't go
to the Gamma Quadrant.

202
00:11:45,673 --> 00:11:48,270
Oh, I can... and I will.

203
00:11:48,312 --> 00:11:50,714
I have to.

204
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,517
But if something were
to happen to you, I...

205
00:11:53,555 --> 00:11:54,989
I don't know what I'd do.

206
00:11:55,091 --> 00:11:56,423
Oh, I'm sure you could find

207
00:11:56,461 --> 00:11:57,987
someone else
to eat your meals with.

208
00:11:58,097 --> 00:11:59,156
Not that you'd have to.

209
00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:01,601
I fully intend to return.

210
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,164
It's not just the meals.

211
00:12:03,207 --> 00:12:04,300
Yes, I know.

212
00:12:04,344 --> 00:12:06,941
I'm the only other Cardassian
on the station.

213
00:12:07,049 --> 00:12:08,540
It's not that, either.

214
00:12:08,585 --> 00:12:10,248
You know that.

215
00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:11,518
It's just that...

216
00:12:12,694 --> 00:12:15,164
you're intelligent
and cultured...

217
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,166
and kind.

218
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:20,971
My dear, you're young

219
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:24,176
so I realize that you're
a poor judge of character.

220
00:12:24,216 --> 00:12:26,949
Why do you always make fun
of my feelings for you?

221
00:12:26,988 --> 00:12:31,224
Perhaps because I find them
a bit, uh, misguided?

222
00:12:31,264 --> 00:12:32,995
Well, if this is what you think

223
00:12:33,034 --> 00:12:34,867
why do you spend
so much time with me?

224
00:12:37,377 --> 00:12:43,219
Because I'm exiled... and alone,
and a long way from home.

225
00:12:43,254 --> 00:12:45,121
And when I'm with you

226
00:12:45,158 --> 00:12:47,424
it doesn't feel so bad.

227
00:12:48,866 --> 00:12:50,460
I'm glad I could help.

228
00:12:53,308 --> 00:12:57,043
Ziyal...
no matter what happens

229
00:12:57,115 --> 00:12:59,916
no matter how bleak
things may look

230
00:12:59,954 --> 00:13:02,687
I promise you I will come back.

231
00:13:02,727 --> 00:13:04,959
You have my word.

232
00:13:07,303 --> 00:13:08,635
I believe you.

233
00:13:08,672 --> 00:13:11,200
Take your hands off her!

234
00:13:11,243 --> 00:13:12,677
Father, no!

235
00:13:12,713 --> 00:13:14,113
You touch my daughter again

236
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:15,412
I'll kill you.

237
00:13:15,453 --> 00:13:16,478
Father...

238
00:13:16,521 --> 00:13:18,457
let him go.
Please!

239
00:13:18,492 --> 00:13:19,790
Go ahead. Kill me.

240
00:13:19,828 --> 00:13:22,230
She'll never forgive you,
you know.

241
00:13:22,265 --> 00:13:25,203
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen.

242
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:26,467
I don't know
what's going on here

243
00:13:26,508 --> 00:13:28,705
but I'm sure it's no excuse
to act like a pair of Klingons.

244
00:13:28,745 --> 00:13:31,717
I'll act as I please, Ferengi.

245
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:34,689
Then you'll excuse me
while I call Security.

246
00:13:34,724 --> 00:13:36,853
I'm sure Odo
will get a big thrill

247
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:39,765
out of having you locked up
in one of his holding cells.

248
00:13:39,801 --> 00:13:42,932
Father... please.

249
00:13:45,446 --> 00:13:48,441
Public opinion seems to be
running against you.

250
00:13:51,358 --> 00:13:54,889
You know... I think that
actually helped my back.

251
00:13:54,931 --> 00:13:56,229
Let's go, Garak.

252
00:13:56,267 --> 00:13:57,861
I'll buy you a drink.

253
00:13:58,906 --> 00:14:03,244
A pleasure...
as always, my dear.

254
00:14:03,281 --> 00:14:05,547
You do have a lovely daughter.

255
00:14:05,586 --> 00:14:07,988
She must take
after her mother.

256
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,967
You're wrong about Garak,
Father.

257
00:14:16,006 --> 00:14:17,406
He's a good man.

258
00:14:17,443 --> 00:14:18,411
You have no idea

259
00:14:18,445 --> 00:14:20,779
how much it pains me
to hear you say that.

260
00:14:22,453 --> 00:14:26,359
It is good to see you again,
Ziyal.

261
00:14:26,394 --> 00:14:29,195
It's good to see you,
too, Father.

262
00:14:29,232 --> 00:14:31,361
What are you doing
on the station?

263
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:35,367
Oh, I had a little skirmish
with a Klingon battle cruiser.

264
00:14:35,412 --> 00:14:39,477
My ship was damaged,
so I came here for repairs

265
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,990
and to spend
some time with you.

266
00:14:44,397 --> 00:14:46,799
And I can see...

267
00:14:46,835 --> 00:14:48,702
we have a lot to talk about.

268
00:14:49,841 --> 00:14:52,073
Remember, this is
a reconnaissance mission.

269
00:14:52,112 --> 00:14:54,105
You are to avoid Dominion
ships at all costs.

270
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:55,812
I want you back
here in one piece.

271
00:14:57,556 --> 00:14:59,321
What about Garak?

272
00:14:59,359 --> 00:15:01,158
I want him back, too.

273
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,756
I suppose
I don't have to tell you

274
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,098
to keep a close eye on him.

275
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:06,299
At the first sign of betrayal,
I will kill him

276
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,107
but I promise
to return the body intact.

277
00:15:09,146 --> 00:15:10,740
I assume that's a joke.

278
00:15:10,783 --> 00:15:12,616
We will see.

279
00:15:28,939 --> 00:15:31,102
You want me
to sponsor your application

280
00:15:31,143 --> 00:15:32,372
to Starfleet Academy?

281
00:15:32,412 --> 00:15:33,345
What do you think?

282
00:15:33,381 --> 00:15:35,248
I think it is a bad idea.

283
00:15:35,285 --> 00:15:37,221
Well, I'd write the
actual letter myself.

284
00:15:37,255 --> 00:15:38,746
I just need you to sign it.

285
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:40,260
Find someone else.

286
00:15:40,295 --> 00:15:41,763
Why?

287
00:15:41,798 --> 00:15:43,961
Because I'm a Cardassian?

288
00:15:44,002 --> 00:15:46,565
You're a Klingon.
Nog is a Ferengi.

289
00:15:46,608 --> 00:15:48,976
Starfleet Academy is
a very accepting place.

290
00:15:49,012 --> 00:15:50,879
You are not just a Cardassian.

291
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:54,411
You are a spy, an assassin
and a saboteur.

292
00:15:54,457 --> 00:15:56,450
I know I've done
some unfortunate things

293
00:15:56,528 --> 00:15:58,464
in the past, and I regret them.

294
00:15:58,565 --> 00:16:00,797
That's why I want
to join Starfleet

295
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:03,033
why I need to join Starfleet.

296
00:16:03,074 --> 00:16:05,067
I'm looking for a fresh start

297
00:16:05,111 --> 00:16:08,242
a way to make up for all
the damage I've done.

298
00:16:08,284 --> 00:16:12,817
I need to prove to myself
that I can be better than I am

299
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,021
but I need your help

300
00:16:14,062 --> 00:16:17,091
your support
to start me on my way...

301
00:16:17,135 --> 00:16:19,367
to redemption.

302
00:16:19,406 --> 00:16:21,876
If that is how you feel,
I will...

303
00:16:21,911 --> 00:16:24,347
consider your request.

304
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:27,253
That's all I ask.

305
00:16:27,288 --> 00:16:31,786
Frankly, I think I can be
quite an asset to Starfleet.

306
00:16:31,831 --> 00:16:34,598
With my extensive experience,
I could skip the lower ranks

307
00:16:34,637 --> 00:16:37,939
entirely and begin my career
as a Commander.

308
00:16:37,977 --> 00:16:39,970
Maybe you should suggest that
in your letter.

309
00:16:40,014 --> 00:16:42,484
Tell them you'd be honored
to serve under me.

310
00:16:42,553 --> 00:16:45,491
Do not play games with me.

311
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:49,590
You have no desire
to join Starfleet, do you?

312
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,000
No, I'm afraid I don't.

313
00:16:51,036 --> 00:16:52,801
Then why all of this deception?

314
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,935
Because lying is a skill
like any other

315
00:16:54,977 --> 00:16:57,778
and if you want to maintain
a level of excellence, you have

316
00:16:57,817 --> 00:16:59,115
to practice constantly.

317
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:00,781
Practice on someone else.

318
00:17:00,823 --> 00:17:02,121
Mr. Worf

319
00:17:02,158 --> 00:17:03,718
you're no fun at all.

320
00:17:05,131 --> 00:17:06,121
Good.

321
00:17:17,188 --> 00:17:18,817
Major...

322
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:21,763
you and I have to talk.

323
00:17:21,798 --> 00:17:23,859
Ah, Dukat, I've had a busy day.

324
00:17:23,902 --> 00:17:26,372
I just want to drink my coffee...

325
00:17:26,406 --> 00:17:28,342
I left my daughter in your care.

326
00:17:28,377 --> 00:17:30,438
You promised me
you would look after her.

327
00:17:30,481 --> 00:17:31,949
I trusted you.

328
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:34,353
Listen, if this is about
taking Ziyal to services

329
00:17:34,389 --> 00:17:35,516
at the Bajoran shrine...

330
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:36,720
I'm not talking

331
00:17:36,761 --> 00:17:39,756
about exposing her
to your backwards superstitions.

332
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,893
She's half Bajoran.

333
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:43,099
That's part
of her cultural heritage.

334
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,199
I understand that.

335
00:17:44,242 --> 00:17:45,733
I'm talking about Garak.

336
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:46,906
What about him?

337
00:17:46,948 --> 00:17:48,542
She's in love with him!

338
00:17:48,585 --> 00:17:50,953
Oh...
I wouldn't call it love.

339
00:17:52,425 --> 00:17:54,554
So you've known about this
all along

340
00:17:54,597 --> 00:17:56,726
and you've done nothing
to stop it?

341
00:17:56,768 --> 00:17:58,431
She was lonely.

342
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,733
The last time I checked

343
00:17:59,774 --> 00:18:02,473
he's the only other Cardassian
living on the station.

344
00:18:02,512 --> 00:18:06,316
The man is a heartless,
cold-blooded killer.

345
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:08,414
Like I said, he's a Cardassian.

346
00:18:08,457 --> 00:18:10,222
Your daughter is a grown woman

347
00:18:10,261 --> 00:18:12,527
capable of making
her own decisions.

348
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:16,003
I'm not fond of Garak, and I...

349
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:18,738
may even think that
their friendship is a mistake

350
00:18:18,778 --> 00:18:22,114
but, the way I see it,
that's her prerogative.

351
00:18:24,089 --> 00:18:26,559
You did this on purpose,
didn't you?

352
00:18:26,593 --> 00:18:27,720
Did what?

353
00:18:27,763 --> 00:18:29,562
Allowed my daughter

354
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:33,402
to associate with a man
you knew was my enemy.

355
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,280
Stood by while
he whispered poison in her ear

356
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:42,314
and all under the guise
of doing me a favor.

357
00:18:42,358 --> 00:18:44,989
No, Dukat, let's get
one thing straight.

358
00:18:45,031 --> 00:18:48,596
I didn't bring Ziyal
to the station for you.

359
00:18:48,705 --> 00:18:50,402
I did it for her

360
00:18:50,441 --> 00:18:53,572
because I knew it would be
better for her to be here

361
00:18:53,614 --> 00:18:54,775
than being a soldier

362
00:18:54,817 --> 00:18:58,051
fighting in your private
little war with the Klingons.

363
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:00,253
Save your excuses, Major.

364
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:06,566
You've betrayed me

365
00:19:06,606 --> 00:19:09,442
and I promise I won't forget it.

366
00:19:09,479 --> 00:19:11,506
If that's a threat...

367
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,577
I'm not impressed.

368
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,111
There was a time when Bajorans

369
00:19:15,157 --> 00:19:18,561
took Cardassian threats
very seriously.

370
00:19:18,597 --> 00:19:20,464
Not anymore.

371
00:19:21,804 --> 00:19:23,569
Good day, Major.

372
00:19:23,607 --> 00:19:25,304
Good day.

373
00:19:36,834 --> 00:19:38,804
I just don't see why
these runabout replicators

374
00:19:38,838 --> 00:19:40,637
can't provide
a more varied menu.

375
00:19:40,742 --> 00:19:43,008
I'd like to get my hands
on that fellow Earl Grey

376
00:19:43,046 --> 00:19:45,482
and tell him a thing or two
about tea leaves.

377
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,147
We've just dropped out of warp.

378
00:19:47,188 --> 00:19:48,349
Is there something wrong?

379
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,257
We can go no further.

380
00:19:50,294 --> 00:19:51,353
What do you mean?

381
00:19:51,396 --> 00:19:53,866
My readings indicate
the source of that coded signal

382
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:55,462
is deep in Dominion space.

383
00:19:55,504 --> 00:19:59,308
I have strict orders
to avoid unnecessary risk.

384
00:20:00,749 --> 00:20:02,946
We must turn back.

385
00:20:02,986 --> 00:20:04,284
Well, I certainly
don't want to take

386
00:20:04,322 --> 00:20:07,921
an unnecessary risk,
but our sensors show no sign

387
00:20:07,963 --> 00:20:10,160
of Jem'Hadar warships
in this area.

388
00:20:10,201 --> 00:20:12,671
True, but the likelihood
of contact will increase

389
00:20:12,705 --> 00:20:16,509
from this point on,
and my orders were very clear.

390
00:20:16,546 --> 00:20:19,074
But we've come all this way.

391
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:21,020
To turn around now
without an answer...

392
00:20:21,056 --> 00:20:24,358
it seems so... un-Klingon.

393
00:20:24,395 --> 00:20:26,558
I am also a Starfleet officer.

394
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,731
Why don't we go
through this nebula?

395
00:20:29,773 --> 00:20:32,243
We can avoid detection,
and get light years closer

396
00:20:32,278 --> 00:20:33,838
to the source
of the transmission.

397
00:20:33,882 --> 00:20:35,749
Our shields would be
useless in that nebula.

398
00:20:35,852 --> 00:20:37,446
But so would Jem'Hadar sensors.

399
00:20:37,488 --> 00:20:39,617
The answer is out there,
Commander.

400
00:20:39,659 --> 00:20:42,392
We just have to have
the courage to find it.

401
00:20:42,431 --> 00:20:45,403
And remember, it's not
just Tain we're looking for.

402
00:20:45,437 --> 00:20:48,500
The <i>Maryland,</i> the <i>Proxima,</i>
the <i>Sarajevo...</i>

403
00:20:48,544 --> 00:20:50,104
Starfleet ships
that have been lost

404
00:20:50,147 --> 00:20:51,581
in the Gamma Quadrant for years

405
00:20:51,616 --> 00:20:53,916
and their crews... brave soldiers

406
00:20:53,955 --> 00:20:56,391
warriors of the Federation,
unaccounted for.

407
00:20:56,426 --> 00:20:59,023
We owe it to them
to do everything in our power

408
00:20:59,065 --> 00:21:01,365
to find them
and bring them home.

409
00:21:01,403 --> 00:21:03,966
It's the honorable thing to do.

410
00:21:05,444 --> 00:21:09,475
You use that word, but you have
no idea what it means.

411
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:12,980
Maybe not... but you do.

412
00:21:16,132 --> 00:21:18,398
Setting course for the nebula.

413
00:21:29,058 --> 00:21:31,689
There's a pocket
of <i>toh-maire</i> gas ahead of us.

414
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:35,761
Bringing her to 031 mark 355.

415
00:21:35,805 --> 00:21:37,968
Steady as she...

416
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,209
Now what could that be?

417
00:21:41,249 --> 00:21:42,217
Whatever they are

418
00:21:42,251 --> 00:21:43,845
they are coming right at us.

419
00:21:49,399 --> 00:21:52,769
Maybe this wasn't
such a good idea after all.

420
00:22:11,476 --> 00:22:13,002
You still haven't lost them.

421
00:22:13,046 --> 00:22:14,071
I know that.

422
00:22:14,115 --> 00:22:15,709
There are
four more Jem'Hadar ships

423
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:16,810
in close pursuit

424
00:22:16,921 --> 00:22:19,118
and at least two ahead of us
on an intercept course.

425
00:22:19,158 --> 00:22:20,456
We must warn the station.

426
00:22:20,494 --> 00:22:22,464
There is only one reason
for the Dominion

427
00:22:22,498 --> 00:22:24,468
to hide such a large fleet
this close to the wormhole.

428
00:22:24,502 --> 00:22:26,335
You think they're planning
to attack the Alpha Quadrant?

429
00:22:26,372 --> 00:22:28,399
I'm certain of it.

430
00:22:28,443 --> 00:22:29,969
Your message is transmitting

431
00:22:30,013 --> 00:22:31,174
but it's hard to tell

432
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:33,516
if it's getting through
all this interference.

433
00:22:33,553 --> 00:22:36,252
We've got to get clear
of the nebula.

434
00:22:36,292 --> 00:22:37,282
What happened?

435
00:22:37,328 --> 00:22:39,355
We've just come to a dead stop.

436
00:22:39,398 --> 00:22:41,459
They have us in a tractor beam.

437
00:22:41,503 --> 00:22:42,994
Repolarize the hull.

438
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,405
Try to shake us loose.

439
00:22:44,442 --> 00:22:47,539
Ah... are we glad to see you.

440
00:22:47,581 --> 00:22:48,640
Could one of you point us

441
00:22:48,683 --> 00:22:50,083
in the direction
of the wormhole?

442
00:22:56,967 --> 00:22:59,905
I'm telling you,
he knows exactly who I am.

443
00:22:59,973 --> 00:23:02,239
Kirayoshi already recognizes me.

444
00:23:02,278 --> 00:23:05,079
Nerys, the O'Brien's baby
is less than a month old.

445
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:07,144
He doesn't recognize
his own fingers.

446
00:23:07,188 --> 00:23:09,215
He spent seven months
inside my belly

447
00:23:09,258 --> 00:23:11,387
listening to my heartbeat

448
00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:12,863
hearing my voice.

449
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,301
There's a connection there.

450
00:23:15,337 --> 00:23:17,671
Every time I walk
into the room, he smiles.

451
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:18,801
It's probably gas.

452
00:23:18,844 --> 00:23:19,812
Thanks.

453
00:23:19,846 --> 00:23:21,782
You always know just
the right thing to say.

454
00:23:23,086 --> 00:23:24,247
How's my baby boy?

455
00:23:24,288 --> 00:23:25,654
He recognized me.

456
00:23:25,691 --> 00:23:27,320
Did he?

457
00:23:27,361 --> 00:23:29,661
Hold on... I'm getting
a priority one distress signal

458
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:30,894
from the Gamma Quadrant.

459
00:23:30,935 --> 00:23:32,461
Dax to Sisko.

460
00:23:32,504 --> 00:23:34,030
You better come out here.

461
00:23:36,312 --> 00:23:37,182
What is it?

462
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:39,878
I've got a message from Worf,
but it's badly garbled.

463
00:23:39,921 --> 00:23:41,116
Maybe I can clean it up.

464
00:23:42,525 --> 00:23:44,358
It says "Jem'Hadar"

465
00:23:44,396 --> 00:23:47,232
and then some coordinates
I can't make out.

466
00:23:47,268 --> 00:23:49,761
"Build up" and then...

467
00:23:53,949 --> 00:23:54,974
Go on.

468
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:58,388
It ends with "imminent."

469
00:23:58,424 --> 00:23:59,392
"Imminent"?

470
00:23:59,426 --> 00:24:00,553
We just lost contact

471
00:24:00,595 --> 00:24:01,961
with two of our listening posts

472
00:24:01,998 --> 00:24:02,966
in the Gamma Quadrant.

473
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,493
The Dominion... they're coming.

474
00:24:05,538 --> 00:24:08,101
Notify Starfleet Command.

475
00:24:08,144 --> 00:24:09,704
Put the station on Yellow Alert.

476
00:24:09,746 --> 00:24:12,582
Make sure everyone knows
this is not a drill.

477
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:13,848
Major, I want you

478
00:24:13,888 --> 00:24:16,724
to take the <i>Defiant</i>
into the Gamma Quadrant.

479
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,728
Locate Mr. Worf.

480
00:24:17,762 --> 00:24:19,322
Find out what the hell's
going on there.

481
00:24:19,366 --> 00:24:21,336
And if an invasion fleet
is on the way?

482
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:23,067
Then get back here
as soon as possible

483
00:24:23,107 --> 00:24:25,908
and God help us all.

484
00:24:37,469 --> 00:24:38,437
Ah, good.

485
00:24:38,471 --> 00:24:40,805
You look like the man in charge.

486
00:24:40,842 --> 00:24:42,276
I was just trying to explain

487
00:24:42,312 --> 00:24:44,407
to your colleagues here
that this is all

488
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:46,112
an unfortunate misunderstanding.

489
00:24:46,153 --> 00:24:48,248
Cardassians are all alike.

490
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:50,283
You talk too much.

491
00:24:51,296 --> 00:24:52,730
Let him go.

492
00:24:52,765 --> 00:24:55,362
I give the orders here.

493
00:24:55,404 --> 00:24:57,806
Release me... or die.

494
00:24:57,842 --> 00:24:59,003
Worf...

495
00:24:59,045 --> 00:25:01,778
do as he says.

496
00:25:08,964 --> 00:25:11,127
This is Internment Camp 371.

497
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:14,803
You are here because you
are enemies of the Dominion.

498
00:25:14,843 --> 00:25:17,713
There is no release, no escape

499
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:20,219
except death.

500
00:25:25,831 --> 00:25:27,926
Another listening post
has gone dead

501
00:25:27,969 --> 00:25:29,232
and the one closest
to the wormhole

502
00:25:29,272 --> 00:25:31,572
is detecting an incoming ship.

503
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,671
Picking up an increase
in neutrino levels.

504
00:25:33,714 --> 00:25:35,046
Something's coming through.

505
00:25:35,084 --> 00:25:36,347
Shields fully charged.

506
00:25:36,386 --> 00:25:37,718
Weapons ready.

507
00:25:37,755 --> 00:25:39,189
The wormhole's opening.

508
00:25:39,226 --> 00:25:39,955
On screen.

509
00:25:43,867 --> 00:25:45,096
It's the <i>Defiant.</i>

510
00:25:45,137 --> 00:25:45,763
We're being hailed.

511
00:25:45,805 --> 00:25:46,966
Put it through.

512
00:25:47,675 --> 00:25:49,166
Major, what have you found?

513
00:25:49,212 --> 00:25:50,646
Trouble.

514
00:25:56,893 --> 00:25:57,861
Father?

515
00:25:57,895 --> 00:25:59,022
Ah.

516
00:25:59,065 --> 00:26:00,124
Have you been waiting long?

517
00:26:00,167 --> 00:26:01,192
Not long.

518
00:26:01,236 --> 00:26:02,899
You should've come
into the shrine.

519
00:26:02,939 --> 00:26:04,966
No, I don't think so.

520
00:26:06,346 --> 00:26:08,373
So, where would you
like to have dinner?

521
00:26:08,417 --> 00:26:09,612
Forget about dinner.

522
00:26:09,653 --> 00:26:11,316
I want you to go back
to your quarters

523
00:26:11,356 --> 00:26:12,483
and pack your things.

524
00:26:12,525 --> 00:26:14,859
There's a ship leaving
for Cardassia in the morning.

525
00:26:14,896 --> 00:26:16,057
I want you on it.

526
00:26:16,099 --> 00:26:18,365
You're sending me to Cardassia?

527
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:24,280
I've just learned
there's a Dominion fleet

528
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:25,979
headed for the wormhole.

529
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:28,284
This place is not safe
any longer.

530
00:26:28,324 --> 00:26:30,191
Father, I'm not sure
that I want to go.

531
00:26:30,227 --> 00:26:31,354
Ziyal.

532
00:26:31,396 --> 00:26:33,525
There's nothing to discuss.

533
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:36,970
I'm not going to let
any harm come to you.

534
00:26:37,007 --> 00:26:39,843
Now, I think you'd better
get ready to leave.

535
00:26:39,879 --> 00:26:41,347
Hmm?

536
00:26:57,215 --> 00:26:58,547
They have been scanned.

537
00:26:58,584 --> 00:26:59,779
They have no weapons

538
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:02,221
and their identities
have been confirmed.

539
00:27:02,258 --> 00:27:03,521
Very well.

540
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,760
You will be sheltered
in Barracks 6.

541
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,533
You are free to move about
the compound

542
00:27:09,572 --> 00:27:12,874
but remember,
beyond the atmospheric dome

543
00:27:12,912 --> 00:27:15,850
there is nothing
but airless vacuum

544
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:17,912
and barren rock.

545
00:27:17,955 --> 00:27:20,425
Leave the dome,
even for an instant

546
00:27:20,461 --> 00:27:22,488
and you die.

547
00:27:22,532 --> 00:27:24,297
We'll keep that in mind.

548
00:27:25,571 --> 00:27:30,172
I've been waiting for another...
Klingon.

549
00:27:59,572 --> 00:28:00,972
General Martok.

550
00:28:14,636 --> 00:28:15,934
Enough!

551
00:28:15,971 --> 00:28:17,634
It's over.

552
00:28:22,652 --> 00:28:26,056
But for you,
it's just beginning.

553
00:28:32,271 --> 00:28:34,104
Do I know you?

554
00:28:34,141 --> 00:28:36,509
I am Worf, son of Mogh.

555
00:28:36,546 --> 00:28:38,277
Yes, I've heard of you.

556
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:39,911
How long have you been here?

557
00:28:40,921 --> 00:28:41,911
Two years.

558
00:28:41,957 --> 00:28:43,950
Aren't you Klingons

559
00:28:43,994 --> 00:28:46,157
supposed to kill yourselves
when you're taken prisoner?

560
00:28:46,198 --> 00:28:48,293
Not when there are
still enemies to fight.

561
00:28:48,337 --> 00:28:50,170
Or hope of escape.

562
00:28:52,445 --> 00:28:56,408
If you... are Worf...

563
00:28:56,453 --> 00:28:58,446
then you must be Garak.

564
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:00,722
He said you would come.

565
00:29:07,007 --> 00:29:08,202
There.

566
00:29:15,357 --> 00:29:16,951
Tain.

567
00:29:16,993 --> 00:29:18,656
What is wrong with him?

568
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,632
It's his heart.

569
00:29:20,668 --> 00:29:21,658
Really?

570
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:24,469
There are many people who'd say
he doesn't have one.

571
00:29:24,509 --> 00:29:27,640
He was convinced
that you would come.

572
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:29,845
He knew I had no choice.

573
00:29:29,886 --> 00:29:30,979
Tain.

574
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:34,591
Tain, I'm here.

575
00:29:38,937 --> 00:29:40,531
My message...

576
00:29:40,574 --> 00:29:42,065
it got through?

577
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,373
It did.

578
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:46,016
Where are the others?

579
00:29:46,051 --> 00:29:47,918
There are no others.

580
00:29:47,955 --> 00:29:50,187
Just Commander Worf

581
00:29:50,226 --> 00:29:51,524
and me.

582
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:55,730
You allowed yourselves
to be taken prisoner?

583
00:29:55,771 --> 00:29:58,105
I taught you better than that.

584
00:29:58,142 --> 00:30:01,741
Living on that station
has dulled your wits.

585
00:30:01,816 --> 00:30:03,011
That's it?

586
00:30:03,052 --> 00:30:04,885
After I've come all this way

587
00:30:04,922 --> 00:30:06,755
after all I've been through

588
00:30:06,793 --> 00:30:08,922
that's all you have
to say to me?

589
00:30:10,133 --> 00:30:12,228
What do you want me to say?

590
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,431
I want you to say

591
00:30:13,473 --> 00:30:15,306
"Thank you, Elim.

592
00:30:15,344 --> 00:30:17,712
"Your loyalty
is most gratifying.

593
00:30:17,748 --> 00:30:19,911
I knew I could count on you."

594
00:30:21,489 --> 00:30:24,017
But I couldn't count on you,
could I?

595
00:30:26,098 --> 00:30:28,125
All you've done

596
00:30:28,169 --> 00:30:30,970
is to doom us...

597
00:30:31,008 --> 00:30:33,912
both.

598
00:30:43,392 --> 00:30:44,758
Sorry I'm late.

599
00:30:44,795 --> 00:30:46,229
What's he doing here?

600
00:30:46,264 --> 00:30:48,929
Captain Sisko invited me.

601
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:52,439
A Dominion invasion
of the Alpha Quadrant

602
00:30:52,477 --> 00:30:54,674
will affect Cardassia
every bit as much

603
00:30:54,715 --> 00:30:56,275
as it's going to affect us.

604
00:30:56,317 --> 00:30:58,651
Besides, we need all the help
we can get.

605
00:30:58,689 --> 00:31:01,091
The Dominion picked
a perfect time to invade.

606
00:31:01,127 --> 00:31:03,029
The Cardassian fleet
is in shambles.

607
00:31:03,064 --> 00:31:04,430
The Romulans are
not much better off.

608
00:31:04,535 --> 00:31:06,869
And between the Klingon war
and the recent Borg attack

609
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:09,069
Starfleet's spread pretty thin.

610
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:11,580
Then we're going to have
our hands full.

611
00:31:11,615 --> 00:31:13,847
There are at least 50
Dominion ships headed our way.

612
00:31:13,886 --> 00:31:16,083
For all we know, that could
just be the first wave.

613
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,721
How soon can we expect
reinforcements to get here?

614
00:31:18,763 --> 00:31:21,997
At maximum warp, two days.

615
00:31:22,036 --> 00:31:23,470
Not soon enough.

616
00:31:23,573 --> 00:31:25,041
What help can we expect
from Cardassia?

617
00:31:25,075 --> 00:31:30,017
My ship and my crew
are at your disposal.

618
00:31:30,052 --> 00:31:31,111
One ship.

619
00:31:31,154 --> 00:31:33,249
Things are looking brighter.

620
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:35,956
Right now, there's no way
we can beat the Dominion.

621
00:31:35,997 --> 00:31:38,092
Our only hope is
to prevent their fleet

622
00:31:38,134 --> 00:31:39,899
from entering
the Alpha Quadrant.

623
00:31:39,938 --> 00:31:42,272
You're going to destroy
the wormhole?

624
00:31:42,309 --> 00:31:44,506
It's always been a final option.

625
00:31:44,581 --> 00:31:46,448
I'd hoped to never use it.

626
00:31:46,485 --> 00:31:48,955
But the Celestial Temple,
the Prophets...

627
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,723
Professor Kahn
of the Trill Science Ministry

628
00:31:51,762 --> 00:31:54,255
has come up with a way
to seal the wormhole

629
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,897
without damaging it
or harming the Prophets.

630
00:31:56,939 --> 00:32:00,105
But Bajor will be cut off
from the Celestial Temple.

631
00:32:01,649 --> 00:32:02,810
Well, history has shown

632
00:32:02,851 --> 00:32:05,321
whenever the Prophets want
to communicate with Bajor

633
00:32:05,355 --> 00:32:06,618
they find a way.

634
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:08,288
- But...
- It's either that

635
00:32:08,328 --> 00:32:11,027
or Bajor becomes
the first Dominion target.

636
00:32:13,572 --> 00:32:16,703
We'll have to remodulate
the deflector grid frequencies

637
00:32:16,745 --> 00:32:19,011
and rig a phase-conjugate
graviton beam.

638
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:22,284
You and Dax start working
immediately.

639
00:32:23,893 --> 00:32:25,020
What about Worf?

640
00:32:25,062 --> 00:32:27,464
If we close
the wormhole, he and Garak

641
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,367
will be trapped
in the Gamma Quadrant.

642
00:32:29,403 --> 00:32:32,864
Casualties... of war.

643
00:32:32,911 --> 00:32:36,247
They have 36 hours
to find their way home.

644
00:32:36,284 --> 00:32:38,550
Let's hope they can make it.

645
00:32:38,622 --> 00:32:40,022
Dismissed.

646
00:32:47,707 --> 00:32:50,200
Before this asteroid
was converted into a prison

647
00:32:50,245 --> 00:32:52,374
the Dominion used
to mine ultritium here.

648
00:32:52,416 --> 00:32:53,384
There was no dome.

649
00:32:53,418 --> 00:32:54,750
Each one of these barracks

650
00:32:54,788 --> 00:32:57,726
had its own life-support system
embedded in the walls.

651
00:32:57,761 --> 00:33:00,494
And Tain was able to modify
that life-support system

652
00:33:00,533 --> 00:33:02,298
and create
a subspace transmitter.

653
00:33:02,336 --> 00:33:03,531
Yes.

654
00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:06,372
There's a crawl space
just behind those panels.

655
00:33:06,411 --> 00:33:10,647
He spent hours in there
working every day

656
00:33:10,686 --> 00:33:12,553
for months on end.

657
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:13,751
Cardassians...

658
00:33:14,861 --> 00:33:16,831
they're clever people.

659
00:33:16,865 --> 00:33:18,299
Especially that one.

660
00:33:20,105 --> 00:33:22,007
But in just a few days, at best

661
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:23,442
he'll be dead.

662
00:33:24,781 --> 00:33:27,115
Then it is up to us
to be clever.

663
00:33:28,455 --> 00:33:30,152
They're releasing
him from isolation.

664
00:33:30,192 --> 00:33:31,160
Good.

665
00:33:31,194 --> 00:33:32,184
Who?

666
00:33:32,229 --> 00:33:33,697
A friend.

667
00:33:37,874 --> 00:33:38,967
Move!

668
00:34:00,853 --> 00:34:03,346
B-negative, in case
you were wondering.

669
00:34:03,391 --> 00:34:06,261
Well, it appears we are all
who we seem to be.

670
00:34:06,297 --> 00:34:08,233
If the blood screenings
can be trusted.

671
00:34:08,268 --> 00:34:09,236
It's all we've got.

672
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:10,533
What about the others?

673
00:34:10,573 --> 00:34:11,871
Have they been tested?

674
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:13,503
Everyone except that Breen.

675
00:34:13,545 --> 00:34:15,071
No blood.

676
00:34:15,115 --> 00:34:16,549
When were you brought here?

677
00:34:16,585 --> 00:34:17,985
Over a month ago.

678
00:34:18,021 --> 00:34:22,257
I was attending a burn-treatment
conference on Meezan IV.

679
00:34:22,296 --> 00:34:25,393
I went to bed one night
and woke up here.

680
00:34:25,435 --> 00:34:27,337
The same thing happened to me

681
00:34:27,372 --> 00:34:30,811
except I was hunting sabre bear
out on Kang's Summit.

682
00:34:30,846 --> 00:34:33,977
Little did I know,
I was being stalked as well.

683
00:34:34,019 --> 00:34:37,458
And now I'm told the changeling
that replaced me

684
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:40,760
has caused the death
of countless Klingons.

685
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,565
It is a grave dishonor.

686
00:34:42,604 --> 00:34:44,574
You are not to blame.

687
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:46,237
I can only imagine
what my replacement

688
00:34:46,277 --> 00:34:47,370
is up to on the station.

689
00:34:47,412 --> 00:34:49,678
We must escape and warn
Captain Sisko

690
00:34:49,784 --> 00:34:52,277
before that changeling
carries out his mission.

691
00:34:58,802 --> 00:35:00,897
Creating a precisely
modulated graviton field

692
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,500
to seal the wormhole
won't be as easy

693
00:35:02,542 --> 00:35:03,942
as Lenara thought.

694
00:35:03,979 --> 00:35:07,578
She was always a lot stronger
on theory than execution.

695
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:08,883
But we'll get it.

696
00:35:08,922 --> 00:35:10,653
I'm sure you will.

697
00:35:10,693 --> 00:35:12,287
Julian!

698
00:35:12,329 --> 00:35:13,661
What are you doing
up this early?

699
00:35:13,766 --> 00:35:15,463
You've been working
for 16 hours straight.

700
00:35:15,502 --> 00:35:17,301
I thought you could do
with some sandwiches.

701
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:19,400
That's very thoughtful.

702
00:35:19,443 --> 00:35:21,971
You're a gentlemen
and a scholar.

703
00:35:22,015 --> 00:35:24,212
Truer words were never spoken.

704
00:35:24,253 --> 00:35:28,216
Oh, if you need anything,
anything at all, let me know.

705
00:35:41,187 --> 00:35:42,918
Ah! It's about time.

706
00:35:42,957 --> 00:35:45,393
You almost missed
your transport.

707
00:35:45,428 --> 00:35:46,623
Where's your baggage?

708
00:35:46,665 --> 00:35:47,928
Never mind.

709
00:35:47,967 --> 00:35:49,732
I'll have it sent to you.

710
00:35:49,804 --> 00:35:51,706
That won't be necessary, Father.

711
00:35:51,742 --> 00:35:53,871
I'm not leaving.

712
00:35:53,912 --> 00:35:57,043
Ziyal...

713
00:35:57,085 --> 00:36:00,616
I know we haven't spent
much time together

714
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:03,687
but I think you know me
well enough to realize

715
00:36:03,732 --> 00:36:06,966
that when I give an order,
I expect to be obeyed.

716
00:36:07,005 --> 00:36:08,702
I'm not one of your soldiers.

717
00:36:08,776 --> 00:36:11,714
No... you're my daughter.

718
00:36:11,815 --> 00:36:14,115
I'm Tora Naprem's daughter, too.

719
00:36:14,153 --> 00:36:15,587
I am half Bajoran.

720
00:36:15,622 --> 00:36:17,717
I don't belong on Cardassia.

721
00:36:17,794 --> 00:36:20,698
You know
I will never be accepted there.

722
00:36:20,733 --> 00:36:22,828
Ziyal, you have to trust me.

723
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:25,467
Things are going to change
on Cardassia.

724
00:36:25,508 --> 00:36:27,273
- What things?
- I don't have

725
00:36:27,312 --> 00:36:28,280
time to explain.

726
00:36:28,314 --> 00:36:29,612
You're leaving now.

727
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:30,618
I can't go.

728
00:36:30,652 --> 00:36:31,745
It's him, isn't it?!

729
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:33,587
That despicable tailor.

730
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:36,255
You don't want to leave
because you're waiting for him?

731
00:36:36,297 --> 00:36:40,260
Garak promised me
that he would come back.

732
00:36:40,305 --> 00:36:42,936
Listen to me, Ziyal.

733
00:36:47,085 --> 00:36:49,282
He's never coming back.

734
00:36:49,323 --> 00:36:51,725
He's probably dead already

735
00:36:51,761 --> 00:36:53,093
and even if he isn't

736
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:56,330
the Federation is going
to seal the wormhole.

737
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:59,308
Garak will be trapped
on the other side.

738
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:01,142
He made a promise...

739
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,981
and so did I.

740
00:37:04,019 --> 00:37:07,185
I said I would wait for him
and I will.

741
00:37:10,431 --> 00:37:13,096
Is a promise...

742
00:37:13,137 --> 00:37:15,369
to an enemy of your family

743
00:37:15,408 --> 00:37:18,073
more important
than obeying your father?

744
00:37:22,155 --> 00:37:24,683
So be it.

745
00:37:24,726 --> 00:37:29,167
Stay here if that's
what you want.

746
00:37:29,202 --> 00:37:33,404
Stay here and be damned.

747
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,411
I should never have come here.

748
00:37:41,451 --> 00:37:43,580
I should have let
that monster die

749
00:37:43,621 --> 00:37:44,850
forgotten and alone.

750
00:37:44,891 --> 00:37:46,485
Frankly, I'm glad you came.

751
00:37:46,527 --> 00:37:47,790
Misery loves company.

752
00:37:47,831 --> 00:37:51,326
All my life I've done nothing
but try to please that man.

753
00:37:51,371 --> 00:37:52,600
I let him mold me...

754
00:37:52,673 --> 00:37:55,736
let him turn me into
a mirror image of himself.

755
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,511
And how did he repay me?

756
00:37:57,549 --> 00:37:58,517
With exile.

757
00:37:58,551 --> 00:37:59,883
But I forgave him.

758
00:37:59,921 --> 00:38:02,791
And here, in the end,
I thought maybe

759
00:38:02,827 --> 00:38:06,231
just maybe,
he could forgive me.

760
00:38:08,104 --> 00:38:10,165
From what I've seen of him
over the past month

761
00:38:10,208 --> 00:38:12,576
he doesn't come across
as the forgiving type.

762
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:13,942
I've been a fool.

763
00:38:13,983 --> 00:38:16,044
Let this be a lesson
to you, Doctor.

764
00:38:16,087 --> 00:38:18,580
Perhaps the most valuable
one I can ever teach you.

765
00:38:18,658 --> 00:38:22,257
Sentiment is the greatest
weakness of all.

766
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:23,267
If that's true

767
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,464
it's a lesson
I'd rather not learn.

768
00:38:30,582 --> 00:38:32,609
I thought
you might want to know...

769
00:38:32,653 --> 00:38:36,286
if you wish to speak
to Tain... do it now

770
00:38:36,327 --> 00:38:37,853
before it's too late.

771
00:38:59,373 --> 00:39:01,070
Elim...

772
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,841
Elim, is that you?

773
00:39:02,881 --> 00:39:04,247
It's me.

774
00:39:05,853 --> 00:39:08,552
Everything's gone dark.

775
00:39:08,591 --> 00:39:10,857
I can't see you.

776
00:39:12,566 --> 00:39:14,502
Are you alone?

777
00:39:15,805 --> 00:39:16,830
Yes.

778
00:39:18,645 --> 00:39:22,346
There's no one else
but you and me.

779
00:39:22,386 --> 00:39:29,856
Surjak, Memad, Brun...
they can't be trusted.

780
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:31,768
They must be dealt with.

781
00:39:31,804 --> 00:39:33,865
I've already taken care of it.

782
00:39:33,909 --> 00:39:39,284
And what about Gul Vorlem?

783
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,654
Were you able to contact him?

784
00:39:41,691 --> 00:39:43,125
Years ago.

785
00:39:43,161 --> 00:39:45,324
The Romulan ambassador?

786
00:39:45,365 --> 00:39:46,333
He's gone.

787
00:39:46,367 --> 00:39:50,671
All your enemies are dead.

788
00:39:50,709 --> 00:39:51,972
Good.

789
00:39:52,012 --> 00:39:56,716
A man shouldn't allow
his enemies to outlive him.

790
00:39:56,821 --> 00:39:59,155
Then you can die happy.

791
00:39:59,193 --> 00:40:03,190
Unless you still consider me
your enemy.

792
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,965
Elim...

793
00:40:05,005 --> 00:40:07,271
promise me one thing.

794
00:40:07,309 --> 00:40:08,743
I'm listening.

795
00:40:08,845 --> 00:40:11,646
Don't die here.

796
00:40:11,684 --> 00:40:14,383
Escape. Live.

797
00:40:14,423 --> 00:40:16,017
Let me guess...

798
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,462
so that I can make
the Dominion pay

799
00:40:18,498 --> 00:40:20,627
for what they've done to you.

800
00:40:20,669 --> 00:40:25,907
You wouldn't deny an old man
his revenge, would you?

801
00:40:25,946 --> 00:40:28,918
I'll do as you ask

802
00:40:28,952 --> 00:40:30,785
on one condition:

803
00:40:30,889 --> 00:40:35,330
That you don't ask me this favor
as a mentor

804
00:40:35,365 --> 00:40:39,032
or a superior officer...

805
00:40:39,073 --> 00:40:42,808
but as a father asking his son.

806
00:40:42,913 --> 00:40:44,815
You're not my son.

807
00:40:44,917 --> 00:40:45,816
Father...

808
00:40:45,919 --> 00:40:48,412
Father, you're dying.

809
00:40:48,458 --> 00:40:51,123
For once in your life

810
00:40:51,163 --> 00:40:53,429
speak the truth.

811
00:40:55,405 --> 00:40:59,573
I should have killed your mother
before you were born.

812
00:40:59,613 --> 00:41:03,781
You have always been a weakness
I can't afford.

813
00:41:03,855 --> 00:41:06,121
So you've told me.

814
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,723
Many times.

815
00:41:08,765 --> 00:41:12,204
Listen, Enabran...

816
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:17,511
all I ask
is that for this moment

817
00:41:17,549 --> 00:41:20,612
let me be your son.

818
00:41:23,127 --> 00:41:26,497
Elim...

819
00:41:26,534 --> 00:41:30,531
remember that day
in the country...

820
00:41:30,575 --> 00:41:34,845
you must have been almost five.

821
00:41:34,883 --> 00:41:36,409
How can I forget it?

822
00:41:36,453 --> 00:41:38,616
It was the only day.

823
00:41:40,295 --> 00:41:42,527
I can still see you...

824
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:46,734
on the back
of that riding hound.

825
00:41:46,774 --> 00:41:51,307
You must've fallen off
a dozen times.

826
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:55,085
But you never gave up.

827
00:41:55,124 --> 00:41:59,793
I remember limping home.

828
00:41:59,833 --> 00:42:03,101
You held my hand.

829
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:07,547
I was very proud of you...

830
00:42:07,582 --> 00:42:08,743
that day.

831
00:42:27,989 --> 00:42:29,583
Garak.

832
00:42:46,794 --> 00:42:50,062
Gentlemen, I don't know
about you...

833
00:42:50,101 --> 00:42:52,503
but my business here is done.

834
00:42:52,539 --> 00:42:55,136
Then I suggest we find a way
out of here.

835
00:42:58,417 --> 00:43:00,819
Captain's Log, supplemental.

836
00:43:00,855 --> 00:43:04,021
A full-scale Dominion invasion
appears imminent.

837
00:43:04,061 --> 00:43:06,999
Still, I remain confident
in my crew's ability

838
00:43:07,034 --> 00:43:10,200
to face this crisis
as they have so many others...

839
00:43:10,241 --> 00:43:12,575
with dedication
and with courage.

840
00:43:12,612 --> 00:43:14,309
Our last listening post
in the Gamma Quadrant

841
00:43:14,349 --> 00:43:15,317
just went dead.

842
00:43:15,351 --> 00:43:16,842
That one was right
on the other side

843
00:43:16,887 --> 00:43:18,321
of the wormhole.

844
00:43:18,357 --> 00:43:20,190
Which means the Dominion fleet
is minutes away. Chief!

845
00:43:20,228 --> 00:43:21,253
Nearly ready.

846
00:43:21,296 --> 00:43:23,061
Worf...

847
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:24,158
Is a Klingon warrior.

848
00:43:24,202 --> 00:43:25,728
He'll understand.

849
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:28,871
Neutrino levels in the wormhole
are rising.

850
00:43:28,911 --> 00:43:30,744
If we're going to do this,
it's got to be now.

851
00:43:30,782 --> 00:43:32,273
Ready.

852
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:33,513
Here goes nothing.

853
00:43:33,554 --> 00:43:35,581
Activate graviton emitters.

854
00:43:35,625 --> 00:43:37,720
May the Prophets forgive us.

855
00:43:50,588 --> 00:43:52,114
We're losing it.

856
00:43:55,965 --> 00:43:56,830
What happened?

857
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:58,496
Someone sabotaged
the emitter array.

858
00:43:58,537 --> 00:44:00,973
Captain, the wormhole's opening.

859
00:44:04,149 --> 00:44:05,640
Battle stations!
