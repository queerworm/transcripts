1
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:15,599
Where do you want me
to put this?

2
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,559
Anywhere you
can find room.

3
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:22,982
I bet you can't wait
to put all this together

4
00:00:22,982 --> 00:00:25,359
so you can start shape-shifting
around the room again.

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,819
Oh, I suppose.

6
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:29,070
Though I did enjoy
sleeping in a bed.

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,866
Well, there's nothing
to stop you from sleeping
in a bed if you want to.

8
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:33,868
Except that now
when I'm asleep

9
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:35,744
I tend to revert to
my gelatinous state

10
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:38,205
and slide onto
the floor.

11
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,290
No, the bed goes.

12
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,876
I'm a changeling,
not a solid.

13
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:43,752
There's no use
pretending otherwise.

14
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,546
I guess we can put
all this in storage.

15
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:48,674
What about these padds?
Uh...

16
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:49,884
<i>Finding and Winning</i>
<i>Your Perfect Mate</i>

17
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:51,343
by Dr. Jennings Rain.

18
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:52,678
I'll take that.

19
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:54,555
I thought I was going

20
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,891
to be a humanoid
for the rest of my life.

21
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:02,187
There were certain things--

22
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,981
You don't have to explain, Odo.

23
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,569
I only read
the first three chapters.

24
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,445
Maybe you should finish it.

25
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,031
Why waste my time?

26
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:14,199
Romance is for solids.

27
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:18,579
Well, you are a solid,
18 hours a day.

28
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,664
I'm sure there are
plenty of women
on this station

29
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:22,791
who would be very
interested in you,

30
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,793
if you gave
them a chance.

31
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:27,295
I'll keep that
in mind, Major.

32
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,172
Right now,
I'd be satisfied

33
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,925
just getting
this room in order.

34
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:34,678
Dax to Kira and Odo.
Go ahead, Commander.

35
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:37,014
There's something we'd like you
to take a look at in Ops.

36
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:38,724
We're on our way.

37
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,185
(<i> sighs</i> )

38
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:51,779
One of our
listening posts

39
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:53,072
in the
Gamma Quadrant

40
00:01:53,072 --> 00:01:55,074
picked this up
a few minutes ago.

41
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:57,034
It looks like
a Cardassian military code

42
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,911
but the computer
doesn't recognize it.

43
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:00,662
Oh, it's Cardassian,
all right.

44
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,539
But I didn't think
there were any Cardassians

45
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,416
<i>in</i> the Gamma Quadrant.
None that we know of.

46
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,043
ODO:
Not Elgol-red

47
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:09,004
or Fifth Order
Military Encryption.

48
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:11,172
Try Courier
Code Five-Nine.

49
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:15,844
ODO:
Strange.

50
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,178
Most Cardassian codes

51
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,306
use a recursive
encryption algorithm

52
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:22,059
but this has a completely
different coding system.

53
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:24,227
Bajoran Intelligence
has a lot of experience

54
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,520
breaking Cardassian codes.

55
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,897
Why don't you
send it to them?

56
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,607
We did, as soon
as it came in.

57
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:30,400
We still haven't
heard from them.

58
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,693
It may take some time.

59
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,570
SISKO:
If someone's sending

60
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,530
coded Cardassian messages
from the Gamma Quadrant

61
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,992
I want to know what
they're saying,<i> now.</i>

62
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:40,577
We do have an expert
in Cardassian codes

63
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,788
living on the station.

64
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,414
SISKO:
You're right.

65
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,916
Dax, get me Mr. Garak.

66
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:51,170
It's good to see you
again, Cara.

67
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,466
I'm<i> sorry</i>
for the interruption.

68
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:55,884
Well, how did it go?

69
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,761
I'm afraid
I disappointed them.

70
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:00,305
I think they were hoping
that the message they picked up

71
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,850
would contain the key
to defeating the Dominion.

72
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,518
You should have seen
the looks on their faces

73
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,436
when I explained
to them that it was

74
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,689
a five-year-old
planetary survey report.

75
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,691
A planetary survey report?

76
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,651
That's the look, exactly.

77
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,736
I would have
thought you'd be

78
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,530
a little disappointed, too.

79
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,573
After all, it could have been
from one of the survivors

80
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,408
of the Cardassian fleet that was
lost in the Gamma Quadrant.

81
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,243
Oh, I'd given up hope

82
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,079
of ever finding any trace
of<i> them</i> long ago.

83
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,455
Really?

84
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,457
I never saw you
as the giving-up type.

85
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:31,294
There comes a time when one
must face reality, my dear.

86
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:34,213
Those people are gone
and are never coming back.

87
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:37,176
Well...
my young friends,

88
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:39,302
I'd like to stay here
and chat all day,

89
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,847
but I have dresses to make,
trousers to mend.

90
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:45,475
It's a full life,
if a trifle banal.

91
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:49,146
And do tell Captain Sisko
that I'd be more than happy

92
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:53,274
to decode any Cardassian laundry
lists that come across his desk.

93
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,359
My dear.

94
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:03,368
My father would be furious
to hear me say this,

95
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:06,538
but... there's something
about Garak I find...

96
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:07,664
fascinating.

97
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,791
Yes, he has his moments.

98
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:29,561
(<i> device beeping</i> )

99
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:36,777
Going somewhere?

100
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:39,524
I really must remember to stop
underestimating you, Doctor.

101
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,069
How did you know?
You mean, that you were lying

102
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,238
about the contents
of the message?

103
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:46,740
You said you'd given up
on the Cardassian survivors

104
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,783
who were lost in
the Gamma Quadrant.

105
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,077
Well, Ziyal was right.

106
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,495
You're not the giving-up sort.

107
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,206
Very good, Doctor.

108
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:56,958
You've come a long way

109
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,836
from the naive young man
I met five years ago.

110
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:03,340
You've become distrustful
and suspicious.

111
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,674
It suits you.

112
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,967
I had a good teacher.

113
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,680
What did the message
<i>really</i> say, Garak?

114
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,101
It was a call for help...

115
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,476
from Enabran Tain.

116
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,687
Tain?

117
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,523
But you said you'd seen his ship
destroyed by the Dominion.

118
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,735
I did, but Tain was head of
the Obsidian Order for 20 years.

119
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:26,113
If he can survive that,
he can survive anything.

120
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,198
I have to find him, Doctor.

121
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,200
I owe it to him.

122
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,618
You don't owe Tain anything.

123
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,203
He had you exiled
from Cardassia.

124
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:36,415
Yes, but, aside from that,
we were very close.

125
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:39,459
He was... my mentor,

126
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,628
and I'm not going
to turn my back on him.

127
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,589
If it'll make you
feel any better,
you can come with me.

128
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,801
All you have to do
is come up with an excuse

129
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,887
why you need the runabout,
and we could leave immediately.

130
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,307
So let me get this straight.

131
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:56,226
You want me to lie
to my commanding officer,

132
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,770
violate Starfleet regulations,

133
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,856
and go with you on a mission
into the Gamma Quadrant,

134
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,400
which will probably
get us both killed.

135
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,819
I'm ready when you are.

136
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,405
In that case...
let's go.

137
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,950
To Captain Sisko's office.

138
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,579
How do you know

139
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,623
that the message
isn't a fake?

140
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:21,126
That it was really
sent by Tain?

141
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,962
The code sequence was
personally designed

142
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,005
by Tain and myself.

143
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,465
No one else knows it.

144
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:29,301
Now, somehow he got
that message out,

145
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:32,346
and I have to follow it
back to its source.

146
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:35,349
Did the message contain
any coordinates?

147
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:36,850
No. Most of it
was identification code.

148
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,102
The rest of it
was just one word, "alive,"

149
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,313
repeated over and over again.

150
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:44,899
So it should be easy enough
to triangulate the source.

151
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:48,236
Captain...
Tain might not be alone.

152
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,737
There could be others.

153
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,698
Troops from the
Cardassian-Romulan fleet,

154
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:55,452
survivors from the Dominion
attack on New Bajor,

155
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:58,163
and even crew members
from those Federation ships

156
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:01,416
that disappeared
in the Gamma Quadrant.

157
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,669
This is a mission of mercy.

158
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,921
You can't ignore it.

159
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:11,218
I'm still not totally convinced
that it's a genuine message.

160
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:14,388
But I suppose there's
only one way to find out.

161
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:18,183
Captain, you can't let him go.
It's too dangerous.

162
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,227
Your concern
is touching, Doctor,

163
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:23,188
but I assure you,
I<i> can</i> take care of myself.

164
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,106
Maybe you can, but you're
still not going alone.

165
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:28,776
Doctor?
I think you've just volunteered.

166
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:31,696
Dr. Bashir
isn't going anywhere.

167
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,950
But I do have
someone else in mind.

168
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,952
I don't know what
makes me angrier--

169
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,496
that you agreed to go

170
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:42,499
into the Gamma Quadrant
with Garak,

171
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:45,793
or that I had to hear it
from Sisko.

172
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,212
I<i> was</i> going to tell you.

173
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:49,589
When?
On your way out the airlock?

174
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,591
A Klingon warrior
does not have to explain

175
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,095
why he chooses to face danger,
not even to his<i> par'machkai.</i>

176
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,596
So in other words,

177
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,598
you were afraid
I'd make a scene.

178
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:02,185
That I'd embarrass you,
maybe even cry.

179
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:05,105
You are capable of anything.

180
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,773
Don't worry, Worf.

181
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,942
I won't be shedding any tears
over you.

182
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,986
Ah. Then you came to wish me
a good death in battle.

183
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:15,198
No.

184
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,033
I came for these.

185
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,294
My Klingon operas.

186
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,796
Well, you won't be using them
for the next few days.

187
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,881
Somebody might as well
enjoy them.

188
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,809
What?

189
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:45,937
Something wrong?

190
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:51,359
You have
a tendency to misplace things.

191
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:56,197
And you're afraid
that I might... lose

192
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,740
your precious operas?

193
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:00,577
Yes.

194
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,955
It's a distinct possibility.

195
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:07,626
If I were you,
I'd hurry back.

196
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:11,338
That is, if you want to keep
your collection intact.

197
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:22,641
Have a glorious death...
or don't.

198
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:24,601
It's up to you.

199
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,285
The Gamma Quadrant?

200
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:44,912
You can't go to
the Gamma Quadrant.

201
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,457
Oh, I can... and I will.

202
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,876
I have to.

203
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,045
But if something were
to happen to you, I...

204
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,047
I don't know what I'd do.

205
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,256
Oh, I'm sure you could find

206
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,050
someone else
to eat your meals with.

207
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,176
Not that you'd have to.

208
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,470
I fully intend
to return.

209
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,013
It's not just the meals.

210
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,764
Yes, I know.

211
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:06,017
I'm the only other Cardassian
on the station.

212
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,477
It's not that, either.

213
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,062
You know that.

214
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,565
It's just that...

215
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:14,025
you're intelligent
and cultured...

216
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,195
and kind.

217
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,906
My dear, you're young,

218
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:23,159
so I realize that you're
a poor judge of character.

219
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,953
Why do you always make fun
of my feelings for you?

220
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:30,291
Perhaps because I find them
a bit, uh, misguided?

221
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,918
Well, if this is
what you think,

222
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,628
why do you spend so
much time with me?

223
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:42,011
Because I'm exiled... and alone,
and a long way from home.

224
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,138
And when I'm with you,

225
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,307
it doesn't feel so bad.

226
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:49,352
I'm glad I could help.

227
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:56,025
Ziyal...
no matter what happens,

228
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,903
no matter how bleak
things may look,

229
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,656
I promise you I<i> will</i> come back.

230
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,782
You have my word.

231
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,579
I believe you.

232
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:10,039
DUKAT:
Take your hands off her!

233
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,499
Father, no!

234
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,294
You touch my daughter again,
I'll kill you.

235
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:15,295
Father...

236
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,338
let him go.
Please!

237
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,632
Go ahead. Kill me.

238
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:21,217
She'll never forgive you,
you know.

239
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,386
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen.

240
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:24,845
I don't know what's
going on here,

241
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,556
but I'm sure
it's no excuse

242
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,015
to act like a
pair of Klingons.

243
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,769
I'll act as I please, Ferengi.

244
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:33,563
Then you'll excuse me
while I call Security.

245
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:36,107
I'm sure Odo
will get a big thrill

246
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,693
out of having<i> you</i> locked up
in one of his holding cells.

247
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:41,696
Father...<i> please.</i>

248
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:47,327
Public opinion seems to be
running against you.

249
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,832
You know... I think that
actually helped my back.

250
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,209
Let's go, Garak.

251
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,586
I'll buy you a drink.

252
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:02,342
A pleasure...
as always, my dear.

253
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,385
You do have
a lovely daughter.

254
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,805
She must take
after her mother.

255
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:14,937
You're wrong about Garak,
Father.

256
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,482
He's a good man.
You have no idea

257
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:19,526
how much it pains me
to hear you say that.

258
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:25,406
It is good to see
you again, Ziyal.

259
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:28,242
It's good to see you,
too, Father.

260
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,370
What are you doing
on the station?

261
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,205
Oh, I had a
little skirmish

262
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,457
with a Klingon
battle cruiser.

263
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:38,503
My ship was damaged, so
I came here for repairs,

264
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,755
and to spend some
time with you.

265
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,635
And I can see...

266
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:48,555
we have a lot
to talk about.

267
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,640
Remember, this is a
reconnaissance mission.

268
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,684
You are to avoid Dominion
ships at all costs.

269
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,602
I want you back
here in one piece.

270
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,064
What about Garak?

271
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,774
I want him back, too.

272
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:01,401
I suppose
I don't have to tell you

273
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,194
to keep a close eye on him.

274
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:04,987
At the first sign of betrayal,
I will kill him,

275
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,824
<i>but</i> I promise
to return the body intact.

276
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,367
I assume that's a joke.

277
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,244
We will see.

278
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,596
You want<i> me</i>
to sponsor your application

279
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,138
to Starfleet Academy?

280
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:33,641
What do you think?
I think it is a bad idea.

281
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,727
Well, I'd write the
actual letter myself.

282
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:37,186
I just need you to sign it.

283
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,563
Find someone else.

284
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,147
Why?

285
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:42,275
Because I'm a Cardassian?

286
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,069
You're a Klingon.
Nog is a Ferengi.

287
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,405
Starfleet Academy is
a very accepting place.

288
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,282
You are not just
a Cardassian.

289
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:52,827
You are a spy, an assassin,
and a saboteur.

290
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,954
I know I've done some
unfortunate things

291
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,956
in the past,
and I regret them.

292
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,333
That's why I want
to join Starfleet;

293
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,419
why I<i> need</i> to
join Starfleet.

294
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,546
I'm looking for
a fresh start,

295
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:06,716
a way to make up for all
the damage I've done.

296
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,384
I need to prove
to myself

297
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,262
that I can be
better than I am,

298
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,264
but I need your help,

299
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:15,600
your support to
start me on my way...

300
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,936
to redemption.

301
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:20,354
If that is how you feel,
I will...

302
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,857
<i>consider</i> your request.

303
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:25,693
That's all I ask.

304
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:30,364
Frankly, I think I can be
quite an asset to Starfleet.

305
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,117
With my extensive experience,
I could skip the lower ranks

306
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:36,579
entirely and begin my
career as a Commander.

307
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,539
Maybe you should suggest that
in your letter.

308
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,083
Tell them you'd be honored
to serve under me.

309
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,003
Do not play games with me.

310
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:48,299
You have no desire
to join Starfleet, do you?

311
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:49,759
No, I'm afraid I don't.

312
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,385
Then why all of this deception?

313
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,554
Because lying is a skill
like any other,

314
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:56,056
and if you want to maintain
a level of excellence, you have

315
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,558
to practice
constantly.

316
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,018
Practice on someone else.

317
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,188
Mr. Worf,
you're no fun at all.

318
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,899
Good.

319
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,578
Major...

320
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,373
you and I have to talk.

321
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,458
Ah, Dukat, I've had a busy day.

322
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,961
I just want to
drink my coffee--

323
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,838
I left my daughter in your care.

324
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:29,007
You promised me
you would look after her.

325
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:30,633
I trusted you.

326
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,426
Listen, if this is about
taking Ziyal to services

327
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,304
at the Bajoran shrine--
I'm not talking

328
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,682
about exposing her
to your backwards superstitions.

329
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,433
She's half Bajoran.

330
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,561
That's part
of her cultural heritage.

331
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:42,687
I understand that.

332
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,355
I'm talking about Garak.

333
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:47,025
What about him?
She's in love with him!

334
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:49,402
Oh...
I wouldn't call it love.

335
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,031
So you've known about this
all along,

336
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,449
and you've done nothing
to stop it?

337
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,326
She was lonely.

338
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,078
The last time I checked,

339
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,288
he's the only other Cardassian
living on the station.

340
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:04,959
The man is a heartless,
cold-blooded killer.

341
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:07,086
Like I said, he's a Cardassian.

342
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,755
Your daughter
is a grown woman

343
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,298
capable of making
her own decisions.

344
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,719
I'm not fond of Garak, and I...

345
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:17,430
may even think that
their friendship is a mistake,

346
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,808
<i>but</i> the way I see it,
that's her prerogative.

347
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,229
You did this on purpose,
didn't you?

348
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,647
Did what?

349
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,274
Allowed my daughter

350
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:31,945
to associate with a man
you knew was my enemy.

351
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:36,824
Stood by while
he whispered poison in her ear,

352
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:40,787
and all under the guise
of doing me a favor.

353
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:43,664
No, Dukat, let's get
one thing straight.

354
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:47,126
I didn't bring Ziyal
to the station for you.

355
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,920
I did it for her,

356
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,214
because I knew it would be
better for her to be here

357
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,967
than being a soldier,

358
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:56,552
fighting in your private
little war with the Klingons.

359
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,596
Save your excuses, Major.

360
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,144
You've betrayed me,

361
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,064
and I promise
I won't forget it.

362
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:10,149
If that's a threat...

363
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,276
I'm not impressed.

364
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,694
There was a time when Bajorans

365
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,990
took Cardassian threats
<i>very</i> seriously.

366
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,908
Not anymore.

367
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,995
Good day, Major.

368
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:23,704
Good day.

369
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,468
I just don't see why
these runabout replicators

370
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:39,345
can't provide
a more varied menu.

371
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,764
I'd like to get my hands
on that fellow Earl Grey

372
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:44,058
and tell him a thing or two
about tea leaves.

373
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:45,685
We've just dropped
out of warp.

374
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:46,936
Is there
something wrong?

375
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,855
We can go no further.

376
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:49,856
What do you mean?

377
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,024
My readings indicate

378
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,316
the source of
that coded signal

379
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:53,985
is deep in Dominion space.

380
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:58,197
I have strict orders to
avoid unnecessary risk.

381
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,450
(<i> sighs</i> ):
We must turn back.

382
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,869
Well, I certainly
don't want to take

383
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:03,995
an unnecessary risk,

384
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:06,497
but our sensors
show no sign

385
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:08,916
of Jem'Hadar warships
in this area.

386
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,210
True, but the likelihood
of contact will increase

387
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:15,048
from this point on,
and my orders were very clear.

388
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,717
But we've come all this way.

389
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,468
To turn around now
without an answer--

390
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,889
it seems so... un-Klingon.

391
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:25,099
I am also a Starfleet officer.

392
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:28,310
Why don't we go
through this nebula?

393
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,730
We can avoid detection,
and get light-years closer

394
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,439
to the source
of the transmission.

395
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,400
Our shields would be
useless in that nebula.

396
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,985
But so would
Jem'Hadar sensors.

397
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:38,196
The answer is out there,
Commander.

398
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:41,074
We just have to have
the courage to find it.

399
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:43,910
And remember, it's not
just Tain we're looking for.

400
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,996
The Maryland,the<i> Proxima,</i>
the<i> Sarajevo--</i>

401
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:48,581
Starfleet ships
that have been lost

402
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,041
in the Gamma Quadrant for years,

403
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,501
and their crews--
brave soldiers,

404
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:55,046
warriors of the Federation,
unaccounted for.

405
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:57,590
We owe it to them
to do everything in our power

406
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,842
to find them
and bring them home.

407
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:02,469
It's the honorable thing to do.

408
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:08,101
You use that word, but you have
no idea what it means.

409
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:11,478
Maybe not... but<i> you</i> do.

410
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,734
Setting course
for the nebula.

411
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,289
There's a pocket
of<i> toh-maire</i> gas ahead of us.

412
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:34,168
Bringing her to 031 mark 355.

413
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:36,378
Steady as she--

414
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,589
(<i> console beeping</i> )

415
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:39,590
GARAK:
Now what could that be?

416
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,674
WORF:
Whatever they are,

417
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,260
they are coming right at us.

418
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:51,144
Maybe this wasn't
such a good idea after all.

419
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,581
You still haven't
lost them.
I know that.

420
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,041
There are four more
Jem'Hadar ships

421
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,626
in close pursuit,

422
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:17,503
and at least two ahead of us
on an intercept course.

423
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:18,921
We must warn the station.

424
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:21,090
There is only one reason
for the Dominion

425
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,050
to hide such a large fleet
this close to the wormhole.

426
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,718
You think they're planning
to attack the Alpha Quadrant?

427
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,720
I'm certain of it.

428
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,723
Your message is transmitting,
but it's hard to tell

429
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,851
if it's getting through
all this interference.

430
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,645
We've got to get clear
of the nebula.

431
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:35,980
What happened?

432
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,815
We've just come
to a dead stop.

433
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:39,942
They have us
in a tractor beam.

434
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:41,319
Repolarize the hull.

435
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:42,820
Try to shake us loose.

436
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,990
Ah... are we
glad to see you.

437
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,116
Could one of you point us

438
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:48,450
in the direction
of the wormhole?

439
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:58,460
I'm telling you,
he knows exactly who I am.

440
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,671
Kirayoshi already
recognizes me.

441
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:03,674
Nerys, the O'Briens' baby
is less than a month old.

442
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,801
He doesn't recognize
his own fingers.

443
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,636
He spent seven months
inside my belly,

444
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,847
listening to my heartbeat,

445
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:11,431
hearing my voice.

446
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,726
There's a connection there.

447
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:16,062
Every time I walk
into the room, he smiles.

448
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:18,314
It's probably gas.
Thanks.

449
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:20,107
You always know just
the right thing to say.

450
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:22,693
How's my baby boy?

451
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:24,153
He recognized me.

452
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:25,863
Did he?

453
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:28,199
Hold on-- I'm getting
a priority one distress signal

454
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:29,242
from the Gamma Quadrant.

455
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:30,951
Dax to Sisko.

456
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,410
You better come out here.

457
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:36,082
What is it?

458
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:38,834
I've got a message from Worf,
but it's badly garbled.

459
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:39,919
Maybe I can
clean it up.

460
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:43,214
It says "Jem'Hadar,"

461
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:46,175
and then some
coordinates I
can't make out.

462
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,719
"Build up"
and then...

463
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:53,974
Go on.

464
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:57,103
It ends with "imminent."

465
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,605
"Imminent"?
We just lost contact

466
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,857
with two of our listening posts
in the Gamma Quadrant.

467
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,402
The Dominion--
they're coming.

468
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:07,196
Notify Starfleet Command.

469
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:08,864
Put the station on yellow alert.

470
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,491
Make sure everyone knows
this is not a drill.

471
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,077
Major, I want you

472
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:15,288
to take the<i> Defiant</i>
into the Gamma Quadrant.

473
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:16,872
Locate Mr. Worf.

474
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,374
Find out what the hell's
going on there.

475
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:20,334
And if an invasion fleet
is on the way?

476
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:22,086
Then get back here
as soon as possible,

477
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:24,922
and God help us all.

478
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:37,643
Ah, good.

479
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,645
You look like
the man in charge.

480
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,230
I was just
trying to explain

481
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,441
to your colleagues here
that this is all

482
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:45,151
an unfortunate
misunderstanding.

483
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:47,320
Cardassians are all alike.

484
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,113
You talk too much.

485
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,657
WORF:
Let him go.

486
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:54,452
I give the orders here.

487
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:56,703
Release me... or die.

488
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:57,955
Worf...

489
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:00,707
do as he says.

490
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,923
(<i> gasping</i> )

491
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,134
This is Internment Camp 371.

492
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:13,762
You are here because you
are enemies of the Dominion.

493
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,640
There is no release, no escape,

494
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,059
except death.

495
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,525
Another listening post
has gone dead

496
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:29,028
and the one closest
to the wormhole

497
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,489
is detecting an incoming ship.

498
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:33,282
Picking up an increase
in neutrino levels.

499
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:34,783
Something's
coming through.

500
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,160
Shields fully charged.

501
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,619
Weapons ready.

502
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:38,954
The wormhole's opening.

503
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,039
On screen.

504
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,044
O'BRIEN:
It's the<i> Defiant.</i>

505
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:47,545
We're being hailed.
Put it through.

506
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:48,964
Major, what have you found?

507
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,299
Trouble.

508
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,849
Father?
Ah.

509
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:01,060
Have you been
waiting long?
Not long.

510
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,811
You should've come
into the shrine.

511
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,771
No, I don't think so.

512
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,148
(<i> laughs</i> )

513
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:08,275
So, where would you
like to have dinner?

514
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,985
Forget about dinner.

515
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,570
I want you to go back
to your quarters
and pack your things.

516
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,614
There's a ship leaving for
Cardassia in the morning.

517
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:15,949
I want you on it.

518
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,244
You're sending me
to Cardassia?

519
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:19,537
(<i> sighs</i> )

520
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:24,124
I've just learned
there's a Dominion fleet

521
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,667
headed for the wormhole.

522
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:28,003
This place is not safe
any longer.

523
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,713
Father, I'm not sure
that I want to go.

524
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:30,881
Ziyal.

525
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:33,133
There's nothing to discuss.

526
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:36,594
I'm not going to let
any harm come to you.

527
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:39,265
Now I think you'd better
get ready to leave.

528
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:40,891
Hmm?

529
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,894
(<i> sighing</i> )

530
00:26:56,574 --> 00:26:59,285
They have been scanned.
They have no weapons,

531
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:01,870
and their identities
have been confirmed.

532
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,163
Very well.

533
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:06,542
You will be sheltered
in Barracks 6.

534
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:09,253
You are free to move about
the compound,

535
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:12,672
but remember,
beyond the atmospheric dome,

536
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:15,509
there is nothing
but airless vacuum

537
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:17,761
and barren rock.

538
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,180
Leave the dome,
even for an instant,

539
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,266
and you die.

540
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:24,059
We'll keep that in mind.

541
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:29,898
I've been waiting for another...
Klingon.

542
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:49,042
(<i> grunting and yelling</i> )

543
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:00,596
General Martok.

544
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:14,692
(<i> groaning</i> )

545
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:17,237
JEM'HADAR:
Enough!
It's over.

546
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:25,745
But for you, it's
just beginning.

547
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:31,918
(<i> groans</i> )

548
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,753
Do I know you?

549
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:36,256
I am Worf,
son of Mogh.

550
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,966
Yes, I've heard of you.

551
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,552
How long have you been here?

552
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:41,720
Two years.

553
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,681
Aren't you Klingons

554
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:46,016
supposed to kill yourselves
when you're taken prisoner?

555
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:47,976
Not when there are
still enemies to fight.

556
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,853
Or hope of escape.

557
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:56,151
If you... are Worf...

558
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,195
then you must be Garak.

559
00:28:58,195 --> 00:29:00,280
He said you would come.

560
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:07,954
There.

561
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:16,796
Tain.

562
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:18,507
WORF:
What is wrong with him?

563
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:20,342
It's his heart.

564
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:23,053
Really?
There are many
people who'd say

565
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:24,221
he doesn't have one.

566
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:27,182
He was convinced
that you would come.

567
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,184
He knew I had no choice.

568
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,352
Tain.

569
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:34,106
Tain, I'm here.

570
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:40,028
My message...

571
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,447
it got through?

572
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:42,822
It did.

573
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,576
Where are the others?

574
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:47,411
There are no others.

575
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:50,997
Just Commander Worf
and me.

576
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:55,210
You allowed yourselves
to be taken prisoner?

577
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,671
I taught you better
than that.

578
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:59,465
Living on
that station

579
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:01,216
has dulled your wits.

580
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,509
That's it?

581
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,344
After I've come all this way,

582
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,096
after all I've been through,

583
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:08,223
that's all you have
to say to me?

584
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:11,560
What do you want me to say?

585
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,811
I want you to say,

586
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,813
"Thank you, Elim.

587
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,190
"Your loyalty
is most gratifying.

588
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,192
I knew I could count on you."

589
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:23,322
But I couldn't count on you,
could I?

590
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,451
All you've done

591
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:30,454
is to doom us...

592
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:33,165
both.

593
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:39,087
(<i> sighing</i> )

594
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:44,635
Sorry I'm late.

595
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:45,969
What's he doing here?

596
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,639
Captain Sisko invited me.

597
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,142
A Dominion invasion
of the Alpha Quadrant

598
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:54,478
will affect Cardassia
every bit as much

599
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:56,188
as it's going to affect us.

600
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,482
Besides, we need all the help
we can get.

601
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:01,026
The Dominion picked
a perfect time to invade.

602
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:02,944
The Cardassian fleet
is in shambles.

603
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,863
The Romulans are
not much better off.

604
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,824
And between the Klingon war
and the recent Borg attack,

605
00:31:06,824 --> 00:31:09,034
Starfleet's spread pretty thin.

606
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,370
Then we're going to have
our hands full.

607
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,747
There are at least 50
Dominion ships headed our way.

608
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:15,791
For all we know, that could
just be the first wave.

609
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:18,418
How soon can we expect
reinforcements to get here?

610
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:21,505
At maximum warp, two days.

611
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:23,173
KIRA:
Not soon enough.

612
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:24,717
What help can we expect
from Cardassia?

613
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:29,513
My ship and my crew
are at your disposal.

614
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:30,639
One ship.

615
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:32,932
Things are looking brighter.

616
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:35,644
Right now, there's no way
we can beat the Dominion.

617
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:37,771
Our only hope is
to prevent their fleet

618
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:39,523
from entering
the Alpha Quadrant.

619
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:41,817
You're going to destroy
the wormhole?

620
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:44,110
It's always been a final option.

621
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,987
I'd hoped to never use it.

622
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:48,323
But the Celestial Temple,
the Prophets...

623
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:51,284
Professor Kahn
of the Trill Science Ministry

624
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,995
has come up with a way
to seal the wormhole

625
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,498
without damaging it
or harming the Prophets.

626
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:59,626
But Bajor will be cut off
from the Celestial Temple.

627
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:02,796
Well, history has shown

628
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:04,964
whenever the Prophets want
to communicate with Bajor,

629
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:06,258
they find a way.

630
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,093
But...
It's either that

631
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,596
or Bajor becomes
the first Dominion target.

632
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:16,309
We'll have to remodulate
the deflector grid frequencies

633
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,687
and rig a phase-conjugate
graviton beam.

634
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:21,899
You and Dax start working
immediately.

635
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,693
What about Worf?

636
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:27,028
If we close
the wormhole, he and Garak

637
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,947
will be trapped
in the Gamma Quadrant.

638
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:32,576
Casualties... of war.

639
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:35,746
They have 36 hours
to find their way home.

640
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:38,248
Let's hope
they can make it.

641
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:39,541
Dismissed.

642
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,968
Before this asteroid
was converted into a prison,

643
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,970
the Dominion used
to mine ultritium here.

644
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:52,930
There was no dome.

645
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:54,807
Each one
of these barracks

646
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:57,309
had its own life-support system
embedded in the walls.

647
00:32:57,309 --> 00:33:00,019
And Tain was able to modify
that life-support system

648
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,814
and create
a subspace transmitter.

649
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:03,732
Yes.

650
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,984
There's a crawl space
just behind those panels.

651
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:10,322
He spent hours in there
working every day

652
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:12,157
for months on end.

653
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:14,493
Cardassians--
(<i> chuckles</i> )

654
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,536
they're clever people.

655
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:17,913
Especially that one.

656
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:21,458
But in just
a few days, at best,

657
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,084
he'll be dead.

658
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,420
WORF:
Then it is
up to us

659
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,672
to be clever.

660
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,675
They're releasing
him from isolation.

661
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:30,676
MARTOK:
Good.

662
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:31,760
Who?

663
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,136
A friend.

664
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:38,642
JEM'HADAR:
Move!

665
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:02,248
B-negative, in case
you were wondering.

666
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:05,293
Well, it appears we are all
who we seem to be.

667
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,128
<i>If</i> the blood screenings
can be trusted.

668
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,422
It's all we've got.
What about the others?

669
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:10,716
Have they
been tested?

670
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:14,344
Everyone except that Breen.
No blood.

671
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:15,929
When were you brought here?

672
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:18,306
Over a month ago.

673
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:21,518
I was attending a burn-treatment
conference on Meezan IV.

674
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:24,730
I went to bed one night
and woke up here.

675
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,815
The same thing happened to me,

676
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:30,151
except I was hunting sabre bear
out on Kang's Summit.

677
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:33,405
Little did I know,
I was being stalked as well.

678
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:36,700
And now I'm told the changeling
that replaced me

679
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,953
has caused the death
of countless Klingons.

680
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:41,914
It is a grave dishonor.

681
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:43,832
You are not to blame.

682
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:45,542
I can only imagine
what my replacement

683
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:47,044
is up to on the station.

684
00:34:47,044 --> 00:34:49,087
We must escape and warn
Captain Sisko

685
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,339
before that changeling
carries out his mission.

686
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:00,265
Creating a precisely
modulated graviton field

687
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:01,850
to seal the wormhole
won't be as easy

688
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,268
as Lenara thought.

689
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:04,978
She was always
a lot stronger

690
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:06,939
on theory
than execution.

691
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:07,981
But we'll get it.

692
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:09,858
I'm sure
you will.

693
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:11,610
Julian!

694
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,028
What are you doing
up this early?

695
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:14,738
You've been working
for 16 hours straight.

696
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:16,615
I thought you could do
with some sandwiches.

697
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,617
That's very thoughtful.

698
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:21,202
You're a gentleman
and a scholar.

699
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,663
Truer words were never spoken.

700
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:27,542
Oh, if you need anything,
anything at all, let me know.

701
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,348
Ah! It's about time.

702
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:44,684
You almost missed
your transport.

703
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:45,769
Where's your baggage?

704
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:47,062
Never mind.

705
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:49,022
I'll have it
sent to you.

706
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:51,066
That won't be
necessary, Father.

707
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:53,068
I'm not leaving.

708
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:56,404
Ziyal...

709
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:59,908
I know we haven't spent
much time together,

710
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:02,953
but I think you know me
well enough to realize

711
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:06,414
that when I give an order,
I expect to be obeyed.

712
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,125
I'm not one of your soldiers.

713
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:10,877
No... you're my daughter.

714
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:13,379
I'm Tora Naprem's daughter, too.

715
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,923
I am half Bajoran.

716
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:17,175
I don't belong on Cardassia.

717
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,845
You know
I will never be accepted there.

718
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:21,930
Ziyal, you have to trust me.

719
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:24,474
Things are going to change
on Cardassia.

720
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:27,144
What things?
I don't have
time to explain.

721
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:29,646
You're leaving now.
I can't go.

722
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:30,981
It's him, isn't it?!

723
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:32,649
That despicable tailor.

724
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:35,234
You don't want to leave
because you're waiting for him?

725
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:39,280
Garak promised me
that he would come back.

726
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,908
Listen to me, Ziyal.

727
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:48,165
He's never coming back.

728
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:50,792
He's probably
dead already,

729
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:52,251
and even if he isn't,

730
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:55,254
the Federation is going
to seal the wormhole.

731
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:58,299
Garak will be trapped
on the other side.

732
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:00,093
He made a promise...

733
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:03,055
and so did I.

734
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:06,265
I said I would wait for him
and I will.

735
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:12,022
Is a promise...

736
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:14,482
to an enemy
of your family

737
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:17,110
more important than
obeying your father?

738
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:23,700
So be it.

739
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:28,205
Stay here if that's
what you want.

740
00:37:28,205 --> 00:37:32,250
Stay here and be damned.

741
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,675
I should never
have come here.

742
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,761
I should have let
that monster die

743
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,012
forgotten and alone.

744
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:45,889
Frankly,
I'm glad you came.

745
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:47,099
Misery loves company.

746
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:48,892
All my life
I've done nothing

747
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:50,685
but try to please
that man.

748
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,229
I let him mold me...

749
00:37:52,229 --> 00:37:54,940
let him turn me into
a mirror image of himself.

750
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,858
And how did he repay me?

751
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:57,859
With exile.

752
00:37:57,859 --> 00:37:59,236
But I forgave him.

753
00:37:59,236 --> 00:38:02,114
And here, in the end,
I thought maybe,

754
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:05,366
just maybe, he
could forgive me.

755
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:09,454
From what I've seen of him
over the past month,

756
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:12,040
he doesn't come across
as the forgiving type.

757
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,458
I've been a fool.

758
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,501
Let this be a lesson
to you, Doctor.

759
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,963
Perhaps the most valuable
one I can ever teach you.

760
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:21,424
Sentiment is the greatest
weakness of all.

761
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:24,844
If that's true,
it's a lesson I'd
rather not learn.

762
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,972
(<i> door opens</i> )

763
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,935
I thought
you might want to know--

764
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:35,563
if you wish to speak
to Tain... do it now,

765
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,107
before it's too late.

766
00:38:58,295 --> 00:39:00,297
Elim...

767
00:39:00,297 --> 00:39:02,007
Elim, is that you?

768
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:03,382
It's me.

769
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:07,971
Everything's gone dark.

770
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:10,140
I can't see you.

771
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:13,685
Are you alone?

772
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,104
Yes.

773
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:21,693
There's no one else
but you and me.

774
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:27,157
Surjak, Memad, Brun...

775
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:29,075
they can't be trusted.

776
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:31,077
They must be dealt with.

777
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,079
I've already taken
care of it.

778
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:38,584
And what about Gul Vorlem?

779
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:40,795
Were you able to contact him?

780
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,421
Years ago.

781
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:44,632
The Romulan ambassador?

782
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,633
He's gone.

783
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:49,804
All your enemies are dead.

784
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,723
Good.

785
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:55,977
A man shouldn't allow
his enemies to outlive him.

786
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:58,396
Then you can die happy.

787
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,148
Unless you
still consider

788
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:02,483
me your enemy.

789
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,152
Elim...

790
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:06,487
promise me one thing.

791
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:07,947
I'm listening.

792
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:10,992
Don't die here.

793
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:13,703
Escape. Live.

794
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:15,413
Let me guess...

795
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,707
so that I can make
the Dominion pay

796
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:19,876
for what they've done to you.

797
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:25,006
You wouldn't deny an old man
his revenge, would you?

798
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:28,051
I'll do as you ask,

799
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:30,136
on one condition:

800
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:34,599
That you don't ask me this favor
as a mentor

801
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:38,228
or a superior officer...

802
00:40:38,228 --> 00:40:42,190
but as a father asking his son.

803
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,025
You're<i> not</i> my son.

804
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:45,193
Father...

805
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:47,695
Father, you're dying.

806
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:50,323
For once in your life,

807
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:52,450
speak the truth.

808
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:58,790
I should have killed your mother
before you were born.

809
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:03,086
You have always been a weakness
I can't afford.

810
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:05,338
So you've told me.

811
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:08,091
Many times.

812
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:11,386
Listen, Enabran...

813
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:16,808
all I ask
is that for this moment,

814
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:19,727
let me be your son.

815
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:25,733
Elim...

816
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:29,737
remember that day
in the country?

817
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:34,200
You must have been
almost five.

818
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,660
How can I forget it?

819
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,703
It was the<i> only</i> day.

820
00:41:39,456 --> 00:41:41,707
I can still see you...

821
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:45,920
on the back
of that riding hound.

822
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,508
You must've fallen off
a dozen times.

823
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:54,262
But you never gave up.

824
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:59,100
I remember limping home.

825
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:02,228
You held my hand.

826
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:05,690
I was very proud of you...

827
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,900
that day.

828
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,671
Garak.

829
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:49,442
Gentlemen, I don't know
about you...

830
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:51,652
but my business here is done.

831
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:54,322
Then I suggest we find a way
out of here.

832
00:42:57,534 --> 00:43:00,078
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

He'll understand.

845

Neutrino levels in the wormhole

Ready.

Activate graviton emitters.
