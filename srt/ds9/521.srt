1
00:00:01,543 --> 00:00:03,420
Another three centimeters
to the right

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,964
and you would have severed
your brachial artery.

3
00:00:04,964 --> 00:00:07,257
Autosuture, please.
And if that had happened,

4
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:09,009
you would have bled to death
right there in the holosuite.

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,720
(<i> groans</i> ):
The human fascination

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,848
with "what might have been"
is tiresome, Doctor.

7
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:16,057
The artery is not severed
and I am not dead.

8
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:17,893
Oh, well, forgive me
for boring you.

9
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:19,269
Let me get straight
to the point.

10
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,729
You're acting
like a fool.

11
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:23,148
Your observation is noted.

12
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,484
But spending two years
in a Dominion prison camp

13
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:27,235
has dulled my reflexes.

14
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:29,363
This only proves that
I need further training.

15
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,365
Turning off the holosuite
safety protocols

16
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,951
during a battle simulation
is, at best, dubious.

17
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:36,537
For a man
with only one eye,
it's positively idiotic.

18
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,998
Now, if you would consider
ocular replacement--

19
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:42,125
I do not want
an artificial eye!

20
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,085
Then you must
accept the fact

21
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:46,171
that you have
a disability and
stop acting like--

22
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:51,426
There are limits
as to how far I will
indulge you, Doctor.

23
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,430
OPS:
General Martok, there is
a priority message for you

24
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,016
from the Klingon High Council.

25
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:00,895
We're done here.

26
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:03,564
Route the message
to my quarters.

27
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:04,773
Acknowledged.

28
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:07,275
Doctor... thank you.

29
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,986
If you really
want to thank me,

30
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:10,946
don't walk in here
dripping blood anymore.

31
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:13,032
It takes days to get it
out of the carpet.

32
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,037
(<i> growling</i> )

33
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,086
Check it now.

34
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:31,884
Still no increase in phaser
relay efficiency, sir.

35
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:36,013
The through-put reading
is steady at 148.7.

36
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:38,473
Have you initialized
the interface program?

37
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,851
Yes, and then I charged
the prefire chamber

38
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:42,561
and recalibrated
the emitter stage.

39
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:44,563
This thing just
doesn't work!

40
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:45,856
Sir.

41
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,068
Very well.

42
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:51,946
We'll start over.
Go to the Engine Room

43
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:54,656
and download
the operating system
into the computer core,

44
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,701
but this time
do it one file at a time.

45
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,162
Aye, sir.

46
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:06,501
Good evening, General.
Cadet.

47
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,045
General.

48
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,800
I did not expect you
until 2200 hours.

49
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,802
I must cancel
our appointment.

50
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,595
I've received new orders
from the High Council--

51
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:18,179
a mission of
some importance.

52
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,599
I must prepare.
Of course.

53
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,977
May glory and honor
follow you on your journey.

54
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,814
Ah... excuse me, sirs?

55
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:29,232
Could I just slip by?

56
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,818
(<i> nervous chuckle</i> )

57
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,199
How is the shoulder?

58
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:41,620
Oh, Dr. Bashir made
the necessary repairs.

59
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,622
I told him it was
a holosuite accident.

60
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:45,499
He would not understand
the need to draw blood

61
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:48,043
in a warrior's
training exercise.

62
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:51,130
Few humans would.
However,

63
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,757
I do apologize again
for the inconvenience.

64
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:56,175
I did not intend
to cause so much damage.

65
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:59,178
I was the one who did not
parry the blow in time.

66
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:01,264
A simple, foolish mistake,

67
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,433
one that I would not have made
two years ago.

68
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,602
Can you discuss the mission?

69
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:11,900
Three days ago,
the Battle Cruiser<i> B'Moth</i>

70
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,945
began a patrol
along the Cardassian border.

71
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,657
They have not been
heard from since.

72
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,909
They are now reported
as missing.

73
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,996
It is possible she was
destroyed by the Dominion.

74
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:26,373
The Jem'Hadar attacked
a Federation starship

75
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,291
near the border
less than a week ago.

76
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,378
That is our assumption as well,
but we must be sure.

77
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,212
So I have been
given command

78
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,549
of a bird-of-prey--
the<i> Rotarran--</i>

79
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,259
to conduct a search
for the<i> B'Moth.</i>

80
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:43,724
This is the first time
I will have led troops
in the field since...

81
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,560
my confinement
by the Dominion.

82
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,854
It must be an
exciting prospect.

83
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:52,273
I tell you, Worf--
without shame--

84
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:55,235
there were days
in that prison camp

85
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,237
when the thought that
I would never again

86
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,614
set foot in
a Klingon vessel

87
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,492
made me weep
like an old woman.

88
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:05,620
I envy you the days ahead.

89
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,372
It will be a glorious adventure.

90
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:12,169
An adventure that we
could share, my friend.

91
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:15,130
I need someone I can
trust at my side

92
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,424
someone whose loyalty
I can count on.

93
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:21,720
Worf, son of Mogh,

94
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,932
I ask you to join me
on this mission

95
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:27,267
as my friend...

96
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,811
and as my First Officer.

97
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:35,937
I've told the General
that I'm inclined

98
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:39,107
to grant his request for
your services, Commander.

99
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:42,069
I can certainly understand
why he wants you along.

100
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,029
You're a fine officer.

101
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:47,199
But I'm not sure
why<i> you</i> want to go
on this mission.

102
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,786
It is a great honor
to be asked to serve
under General Martok.

103
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:55,414
And he saved my life in
the Dominion prison camp.

104
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:57,876
Oh? You didn't put that
in your mission report.

105
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,711
It was a personal matter.

106
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,339
Not something that belongs
in an official report.

107
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,965
Go on.

108
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,800
You know that I was
forced to fight

109
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,053
the Jem'Hadar guards
in the camp.

110
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,930
Each day they would
call me to the ring,

111
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,723
and each day
I would fight,

112
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:16,603
but then there came a day
when I... wavered.

113
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,480
You mean you didn't want
to go back into the ring?

114
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,650
No. I mean I considered
letting them kill me.

115
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,736
It seemed like the only way out.

116
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,446
Just before I went
into the ring,

117
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,615
Martok turned
to wish me success,

118
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,450
and then he saw
what I was planning--

119
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,160
he saw it in my eyes.

120
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,662
It was a moment
of<i> tova'dok.</i>

121
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:35,956
Of what?

122
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,959
There is no human word for it.

123
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,878
It is a moment of... clarity

124
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,214
between two warriors
on a field of battle.

125
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,425
Much is said
without the need for words.

126
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:49,970
In that moment, he<i> knew</i>
what was in my mind.

127
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,973
Once I realized that he saw
my intention to give up,

128
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,434
I could no longer
go through with it.

129
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:58,478
I went back into the ring
and fought once more.

130
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,648
He had given me
his warrior's heart.

131
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,779
Perhaps it is something
a human cannot understand.

132
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:15,078
As of this moment,

133
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,622
you are relieved
of all Starfleet obligations

134
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,624
and placed on detached service

135
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,043
to the Imperial Klingon
Defense Forces.

136
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,840
Thank you, sir.

137
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,383
Mr. Worf.

138
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,512
<i>Qapla'!</i>

139
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,056
<i>Qapla'!</i>

140
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,036
The revised duty roster.

141
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,079
Read it and weep.

142
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,665
Small arms
recalibration?

143
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,792
Does that mean<i> all</i> the
small arms on the station?

144
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,837
Afraid so. And I need
an experienced combat
officer to do it.

145
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:07,588
Worf has already set up
the parameters.

146
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,257
All you need to do is
make sure it gets done.

147
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,843
I'm the new
Intelligence Officer?

148
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,178
(<i> Dax and O'Brien snicker</i> )

149
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,804
It has to be
a Starfleet officer

150
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,764
with a level-4
security clearance.

151
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,099
That means either you or Dax,

152
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,101
and I need Dax
to take over

153
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,478
as Fleet
Liaison Officer.

154
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,104
Beats retuning phaser rifles.

155
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,565
Well, I certainly hope
Worf's enjoying himself

156
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,151
while we're stuck here
taking over his duties.

157
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,945
Julian, have you ever been
on a Klingon ship?

158
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,407
If you think the<i> Defiant</i>
is cramped and uncomfortable,

159
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,783
try spending a week
on a bird-of-prey.

160
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:38,245
Worf isn't exactly
taking a luxury cruise.

161
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,038
Serving on a Klingon ship

162
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:42,165
is like being with a gang
of ancient sea pirates.

163
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:44,709
You advance in rank by
killing the people above you.

164
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,504
So everywhere you turn
you're surrounded
by potential assassins.

165
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,923
Well, that's crazy.
How can a ship
function like that?

166
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,883
It's not quite that chaotic.

167
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:54,594
The social and military
hierarchy of a Klingon vessel

168
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,513
is very strictly enforced.

169
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,599
A subordinate can only
challenge a direct superior,

170
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,935
and only under
certain conditions.

171
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,520
What sort of "conditions"?

172
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,231
Dereliction of duty,

173
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,733
dishonorable conduct,
cowardice...

174
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,485
Cowardice? A Klingon?

175
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,153
It's been known to happen.

176
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,864
The Klingons are as
diverse a people as any.

177
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,991
Some of them are strong,
and some of them are weak.

178
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,952
I'd say those two

179
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:22,330
definitely fall into
the strong category.

180
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:38,763
Trouble?
Not yet.

181
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,099
I can see why they
caught your attention.

182
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,892
Are they off
Martok's new ship?

183
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,144
Just docked.

184
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,770
They seem
quiet enough.

185
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,482
For the moment, maybe,

186
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,817
but you see the one on the left
wearing the necklace?

187
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,402
Yes.

188
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:53,778
Those are neck bones...

189
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,030
Cardassian neck bones.

190
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:04,164
Decided not to wear
the sash after all?

191
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,916
Officially, there is no
House of Mogh in the Empire,

192
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,961
so I saw little point
in wearing its emblem
on a Klingon ship.

193
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:11,671
How do you think
the crew's going to feel

194
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,132
about serving under a man
without a House?

195
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,217
How they feel
is unimportant.

196
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,428
All I require from them
is obedience.

197
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:21,973
Spoken like an uncaring,
hard-nosed autocrat--

198
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,891
the quintessential
First Officer.

199
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,605
I-I do not wish
to have a lengthy good-bye.

200
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:31,858
I wasn't planning
on having one.

201
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,026
Good.

202
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,904
(<i> airlock doors open</i> )

203
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,457
Jadzia.
Yes.

204
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,209
I think it
would be better

205
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,835
to part company
here on the station.

206
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,796
Oh, I'm coming with you.
What?

207
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,007
The<i> Rotarran</i>
is shorthanded,

208
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,301
and I still have
four months' leave coming.

209
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,719
And I've already cleared it
with Martok and Benjamin.

210
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,721
I'm your new Science Officer.

211
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:04,849
Why did you not tell me?

212
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,643
It's more fun this way.

213
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:09,062
And, after getting
a good look

214
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,272
at a couple members
of the<i> Rotarran's</i> crew,

215
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:15,026
I don't think we're going
to be having a lot of fun
on this mission.

216
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,174
Boo!

217
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,678
(<i> laughing</i> )

218
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,557
<i>Ros-te-ka cha'Domak</i>
<i>ootha Trill?</i>

219
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,227
I am Tavana,
Engineering Officer.

220
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:51,646
I'm Jadzia Dax,
Science Officer.

221
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:55,233
Dax? Are you related
to the great Curzon Dax?

222
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,569
Curzon was the last host
for my symbiont.

223
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,946
I carry his memories.
Ah!

224
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:04,117
My mother met the great Curzon
on the Homeworld once.

225
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,994
She said he was
very taken with her.

226
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:11,291
Curzon was very "taken"
with many people.

227
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,126
So was my mother.

228
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,128
(<i> both laughing</i> )

229
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,933
I am Worf, son of Mogh.

230
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:33,104
I now take my place
as First Officer.

231
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:36,857
I serve the Captain,
but I stand for the crew.

232
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,655
Who brings the record of battle
for this ship?

233
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,709
I, Kornan,
son of Shovak,

234
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,670
Weapon's Officer
of the ship of<i> Rotarran,</i>

235
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,546
present the glorious record
of our honor

236
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,923
and hope that you may find us
worthy of your leadership.

237
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,848
If you're looking for victories,
you won't find any.

238
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:12,560
Not for the last
seven months.

239
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,773
I do not need help recognizing
a list of failures.

240
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,028
It is clear to me

241
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:26,199
that none of you are worthy
of my blood or my life.

242
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,703
But I will stand for you,

243
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:33,080
and together, we will restore
honor to this ship

244
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,542
and bring glory to the Empire.

245
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:47,345
Ah...

246
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,769
I have accepted
the crew's battle records,

247
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:57,397
and on their behalf,
I pledge you our lives

248
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:00,983
and ask that you lead us
as Commander of this ship.

249
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:10,117
I accept your lives
into my hands.

250
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,536
<i>De-lak DoH!</i>

251
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:14,748
WORF:
Clear all
moorings.

252
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:16,374
Release
docking clamps.

253
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:18,042
CREWMAN:
Docking clamps
released.

254
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,211
Bow thrusters ahead
one half.

255
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:23,798
We have cleared
the docking ring.

256
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:26,843
Ahead one-quarter impulse.

257
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,433
Helmsman, plot a direct course

258
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:36,018
to the last known
position of the<i> B'Moth,</i>
maximum warp.

259
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,730
No. That would take us
through the Tong Beak Nebula.

260
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,565
I want to go
around the nebula.

261
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:43,443
General, that will add
a full day to our journey.

262
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,903
I'm aware of that.

263
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:46,905
There are reports
of the Dominion

264
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:48,615
operating ships
in the nebula.

265
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:52,535
I would like to avoid
a fight with the Jem'Hadar.

266
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:53,745
You wish to...

267
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:56,539
<i>avoid</i> a fight?

268
00:15:56,539 --> 00:16:01,419
Your tone does not sit well
with me, Helmsman.

269
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:04,547
Our mission
is to find the<i> B'Moth,</i>

270
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:07,216
not to satisfy
your warrior's pride.

271
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:11,471
My apologies, sir.
I meant no disrespect.

272
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,973
Then follow your orders
and lay in a course.

273
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,182
Maximum warp.

274
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,059
Yes, Commander.

275
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,271
Maximum warp,<i> around...</i>

276
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:21,522
the nebula.

277
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,026
Helm ready.

but my name is<i> Dax,</i>

293
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:46,816
and I'm the new Science Officer
on this garbage scow,

294
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:49,652
and<i> you</i> were in<i> my</i> seat.

295
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:52,071
(<i> groaning</i> )

296
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,032
I'm glad we understand
each other.

297
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:56,409
Now get... down
to the other end

298
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,994
where you belong.

299
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,585
Stewed bok-rat liver?

300
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,462
It's not very fresh.

301
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:11,215
With a little bloodwine,
it might be acceptable.

302
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:15,511
Ha. There's been no bloodwine
on this ship for six months.

303
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,221
Really?

304
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,891
Then I'm glad
I brought three barrels aboard

305
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:21,642
before we left Deep Space 9.

306
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,312
<i>Three</i> barrels?

307
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,191
"Dishonorable conduct.

308
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,277
"Dereliction of duty.

309
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,820
"Inattention to orders.

310
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,196
"Unmotivated.

311
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,323
Insufficiently aggressive."

312
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:40,078
These personnel reports
read like prison records.

313
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:42,455
We should remember
that the<i> Rotarran</i>
has been defeated

314
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,624
again and again
by the Jem'Hadar.

315
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:47,585
It is not surprising the
crew morale has suffered.

316
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:50,588
It's more than a case
of low morale, Worf.

317
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:53,549
This crew has been defeated
so many times,

318
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:58,054
they<i> expect</i> defeat,
and that is dangerous.

319
00:18:58,054 --> 00:18:59,806
They need a victory.

320
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:02,141
One decisive battle
against the Jem'Hadar

321
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,143
would do much to
lift their spirits.

322
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,021
And mine.

323
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:15,113
No one hungers for a victory
over the Jem'Hadar

324
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:19,325
more than I do--
no one--

325
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:22,036
but we must be cautious.

326
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:25,581
We cannot risk
taking this crew into combat
before they're ready.

327
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,668
They will be ready.
I will see to that.

328
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,586
I know you will, my friend.

329
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,588
Together,
we will make the<i> Rotarran</i>

330
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:37,051
an honorable ship again,
a ship worthy of the Empire.

331
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:39,261
You may return
to your station.

332
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:48,813
The Cardassians
were trapped between us
and the asteroid field.

333
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:51,691
It was perfect.
Their power was failing.

334
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:55,319
They had no other ships
nearby, and our weapons
were fully charged.

335
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,655
And we were still denied
a victory.

336
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:02,409
Three Jem'Hadar ships appeared
from out of the asteroid field.

337
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:03,995
Three to one are long odds.

338
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:06,039
I'd say you did well just...

339
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,582
getting away
with your ship in one piece.

340
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:11,335
Getting away is something
we've become very good at.

341
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,004
The<i> Rotarran</i>
can run away from battle

342
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:15,006
faster than any ship
in the Quadrant.

343
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:17,257
You never could handle
your bloodwine, Leskit.

344
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,677
You sound
like a sniveling Ferengi

345
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,428
crying about lost profit.

346
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:24,015
That's supposed
to wound my pride,

347
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:26,017
but Tavana has forgotten

348
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:28,310
that no one serving
on the<i> Rotarran</i>

349
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,896
has any pride left.

350
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:32,356
Does that
include me?

351
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:38,988
I do not wish to insult someone
who brought me wine,

352
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:42,867
but one does wonder
why the successor
to the great Curzon Dax

353
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:46,913
would consent to serve
upon a ship like this.

354
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,664
It's no mystery.

355
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,667
She's the<i> parmach'kai</i>
of our new First Officer.

356
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,962
I heard it on the space station
before we left.

357
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:58,007
Worf is only part
of the reason I'm here.

358
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:01,677
I think it is an honor
to serve under General Martok.

359
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,346
You mean the one-eyed giant?
(<i> laughter</i> )

360
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,058
I wouldn't let him
hear you say that.

361
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:08,726
He won't.

362
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:11,104
Unless Worf is not the only one

363
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:13,689
you're sharing a bed with
this trip.

364
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:17,610
On this trip,
my bed is as empty
as yours, Leskit,

365
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:21,781
except<i> mine</i> is
empty by choice.

366
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,407
(<i> crew laughing</i> )

367
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:26,493
Now, that is a sound
I haven't heard

368
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,204
on this ship
for a long time.

369
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:31,124
It won't last.

370
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:35,044
This ship is made for tears,
not laughter.

371
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:38,172
You're really not much fun
at parties, are you, Kornan?

372
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:39,966
Make your jokes.

373
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:43,302
Hold off fate for another day
if you can,

374
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:49,516
but this ship and all the souls
within its hull are cursed.

375
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,727
Death and dishonor

376
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,272
walk these corridors
like members of the crew.

377
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:56,107
Aw, you talk
too much, Kornan.

378
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:58,151
Tell me you
don't believe it, too.

379
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:00,278
(<i> equipment powers up</i> )

380
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:02,029
We've cloaked.

381
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,031
WORF:
Alert Status One.

382
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,950
A Jem'Hadar patrol ship
is directly ahead.

383
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,327
Prepare for combat operations.

384
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,747
(<i> alarm blares</i> )

385
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,415
Now you will see.

386
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:17,795
Either death or dishonor
will visit us this day,

387
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:21,757
and there will be nothing
that you or I

388
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,093
or any of us can do about it.

389
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,981
MARTOK:
What are they doing here

390
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:39,357
this far
from the Cardassian border?

391
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:42,153
DAX: They're conducting
active polaron scans
of this sector.

392
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:45,239
It's likely they're
on some kind of
reconnaissance mission.

393
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,992
Can their scans penetrate
our cloak?

394
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:50,368
I'd say there's less
than a three percent
chance of detection.

395
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,038
What's our weapons status?

396
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:53,831
Torpedo bays are loaded.
Warheads are armed.

397
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:55,916
Disruptors are
locked on target.

398
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,335
They've increased speed.

399
00:22:57,335 --> 00:22:58,836
They're beginning
to pull away.

400
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:00,171
Shall I
match velocity?

401
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:03,216
No.

402
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:05,176
Take us back
to our original course.

403
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:08,721
Forgive this unworthy officer's
poor hearing,

404
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,723
but what was your order?

405
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,142
Take us back
to our original course!

406
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:16,937
Our priority
is to find the<i> B'Moth.</i>

407
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,320
Sir, we have them
in our sights.

408
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,072
They cannot escape if--
No, Worf.

409
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:27,447
But letting
the ship go--

410
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:28,991
Do not question me!

411
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,452
Is the course laid in?

412
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,913
Yes, Captain.

413
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:36,290
I await your next command.

414
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,293
Engage.

415
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:49,929
MARTOK:
Stand down
from Alert Status.

416
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,972
You have the Bridge.

417
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,562
Commander.

418
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:03,984
That was a mistake.

419
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,986
We shouldn't have
let them go.

420
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:09,740
Our orders are to find
the<i> B'Moth,</i> not seek combat.

421
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,951
It was a prudent decision.

422
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,660
To hell with prudence.

423
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,495
This isn't
a Federation starship.

424
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,331
This is a Klingon
bird-of-prey.

425
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:19,750
We could've had an easy victory,

426
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,920
and in case you haven't noticed,
this crew could use a victory.

427
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,631
Enough.
You may be my<i> parmach'kai,</i>

428
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:27,133
but that does not
give you the right--

429
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:29,135
I'm an officer on this ship,

430
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:31,304
and I am trying
to warn my superior

431
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:33,347
that a dangerous situation
is developing

432
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:36,225
and that he'd better
do something about it.

433
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:38,852
What do you mean "dangerous"?

434
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,983
Take a good look
around you, Commander.

435
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:45,901
Maybe it's just me,

436
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,903
but I think
we're in trouble.

437
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,499
I brought you here
to support me,

438
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:03,585
not to undermine my authority.

439
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:06,713
I am simply trying to point out
that we had an opportunity

440
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:10,426
to destroy an enemy ship
with little risk to ourselves.

441
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,886
Little risk?

442
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:15,681
What if they'd have gotten off

443
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:18,225
a distress call
before we could destroy them?

444
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,644
They could have
given away our position,
called in reinforcements.

445
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:23,647
We would have spent
the next three days
avoiding Jem'Hadar ships,

446
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:26,066
instead of carrying
out our mission.

447
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,777
No, my friend.

448
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:31,197
No...

449
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:34,574
This was not the right time
for battle.

450
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:41,748
You question my judgment
in this matter?

451
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:45,378
No.
Good.

452
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:48,714
Without your support,
I cannot command this ship.

453
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,468
Tell me...

454
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:55,054
that I have not
made a mistake

455
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,223
in making you
my First Officer.

456
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:59,517
You have my full support,
General.

457
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:04,730
I knew you would
not fail me, Worf,

458
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:09,068
and you can rest assured,
I will not fail you.

459
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:23,499
LESKIT:
Two years, I spent
on the Cardassian border.

460
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:27,461
Two years fighting Guls
and Legates and Glinns.

461
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:29,796
They were
cunning enemies.

462
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:31,507
Always had us chasing

463
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:34,760
holo-projections
and sensor ghosts.

464
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,555
Everything was
a game with them.

465
00:26:37,555 --> 00:26:41,141
Always had a plan within
a plan within a plan,

466
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,018
leading to a trap.

467
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,521
It was an honor to kill them.

468
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:46,897
(<i> spits</i> )

469
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:49,191
The Cardassians.

470
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:50,608
Ah!

471
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:53,904
But you can respect a Cardassian

472
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:57,533
because<i> he</i> fights
for his people

473
00:26:57,533 --> 00:27:01,954
and<i> he</i> follows a code,
just like we do,

474
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:05,623
but not the soldiers
of the Dominion,

475
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:08,252
not the Jem'Hadar.

476
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:11,755
No. They don't fight
for anything.

477
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:15,259
They fight because they're
designed that way,

478
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:18,262
because they're programmed
to fight.

479
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:21,848
They have no honor.

480
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,309
You're right.

481
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:26,145
That's why they're
better than us.

482
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:29,315
That's enough. You're on duty
in an hour, and you--

483
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:31,609
Ah, the Trill doesn't want you
to know the truth,

484
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:33,235
my young friend,

485
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:35,070
but you deserve to know--

486
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:39,575
the Jem'Hadar are smarter,
they're faster,

487
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:42,286
and they're stronger
than we are.

488
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:44,746
How can you say
these things?!

489
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,540
He's drunk. Ignore him.

490
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,666
No! You listen!

491
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:51,128
Listen and maybe
learn something!

492
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:54,798
The Jem'Hadar
are the future!

493
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,175
Shut up, Leskit.

494
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:58,051
You know why?

495
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:00,887
Because they can break us.

496
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:05,601
Just like they
broke Martok.
That's enough!

497
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:07,978
She doesn't want you
to know the truth.

498
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:10,856
Martok fears them.

499
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:14,776
That's why
we didn't attack them.

500
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,736
Martok fears them!

501
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,614
(<i> growls</i> )

502
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:25,787
(<i> yelling</i> )

503
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:43,639
Dax. Dax?

504
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:45,516
What happened?
Are you all right?

505
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:47,184
I had to take Ortakin
to surgery.

506
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:49,102
Kornan almost killed him.

507
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,938
Why?
Because Leskit was drunk.

508
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:54,525
I do not understand.
No, you don't understand

509
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:56,735
because you're too busy
worrying about Martok

510
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,320
while the crew
is falling apart.

511
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,575
Kornan needed
to attack someone,

512
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:04,451
and he lost control,

513
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:06,328
but this is only
the beginning.

514
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,121
This crew has lost
half a dozen 

515
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:10,457
separate actions
to the Jem'Hadar.

516
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:13,043
The casualty list
is as long as my arm,

517
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:15,170
and now they're
serving under a man

518
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,339
who seems to have
left more behind

519
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:19,258
than just an eye
in that prison camp.

520
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:21,176
Do not speak of the Captain
in that manner.

521
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,053
Not while I am First Officer.

522
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:26,139
Look, I like Martok,

523
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:28,726
but this crew
needs a leader,

524
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:31,061
someone who'll remind
them of their duty

525
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:33,522
as soldiers of the Empire,

526
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,815
and they need that
leader right now

527
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:37,859
or I promise you,
they will explode.

528
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,653
It will not come to that!

529
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,782
I know Martok.

530
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,285
He is a great man.

531
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:49,121
He will not fail us,
but we must give him time.

532
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,998
Time may be the one thing
we don't have, Worf.

533
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,667
What happened
in that mess hall

534
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:56,002
could happen
all over this ship,

535
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:59,757
and if you think the blood
looks bad on my uniform,

536
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:03,218
wait until the decks
are dripping with it.

537
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:19,276
DAX:
Commander, I'm picking up
a Klingon distress call.

538
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:21,695
It's very faint,
but I might be able to...

539
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:23,447
It's the<i> B'Moth.</i>

540
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,908
They were attacked...

541
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,662
by the Jem'Hadar
and lost main power.

542
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:31,664
Heavy casualties.

543
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:33,457
At least 30 survivors.

544
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:35,375
In need of assistance.

545
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,960
Emergency power's failing.

546
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,129
The message repeats.
Location?

547
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:42,924
The signal is coming
from 055 mark 342.

548
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,885
Distance--
at least seven light years.

549
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:50,015
Helm, alter course
to 055 mark 342.

550
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:51,391
Understood.

551
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,768
I will inform the General.

552
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:54,394
Engineer, you have the Bridge.

553
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:08,408
I want to thank you
for what you did

554
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:09,993
in the mess hall.

555
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,829
Is Ortakin
your<i> parmach'kai?</i>

556
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:16,834
Things are coming
to a head on this ship.

557
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:20,212
When the fighting breaks
out, stay with me.

558
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:22,214
I'll protect you.

559
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:25,175
I was still hoping there wasn't
going to be any fighting.

560
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,927
(<i> door opens</i> )

561
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,272
Station.

562
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,194
Station!

563
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:03,004
Something is wrong here, Worf.
I can feel it.

564
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:05,507
If the<i> B'Moth</i> was attacked
by the Jem'Hadar,

565
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:07,217
why would there be survivors?

566
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:09,636
Since we do not know any
details of the battles,

567
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:11,346
it is difficult
to speculate.

568
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,098
We both know the Jem'Hadar

569
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,392
do not leave a task
half-finished.

570
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:17,936
If they left the ship intact
and part of the crew
still alive,

571
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,354
they did it for a reason.

572
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,440
There could be
many explanations.

573
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,483
The<i> B'Moth</i> could have
inflicted heavy damage

574
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,861
on the Jem'Hadar ships,
forcing them to withdraw.

575
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:27,529
The Jem'Hadar could
have been recalled--

576
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:29,531
How is it
that I have only one eye

577
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:33,118
but I can see more clearly
than anyone around me?

578
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:35,454
They deliberately left survivors
on that ship.

579
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:39,917
Why? Because they want someone
to try to rescue them.

580
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:43,921
Oh, do not take this
personally, my friend.

581
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:47,257
I spent two years
with the Jem'Hadar.

582
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:50,009
I do not expect you to have
the same insight into them

583
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,386
that I do.

584
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:56,099
They're soulless creatures,
Worf.

585
00:32:56,099 --> 00:33:01,939
Fighting for no goal, no purpose
except to serve the Founders.

586
00:33:01,939 --> 00:33:04,232
They take no pleasure
in what they do.

587
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:07,193
Nothing is glorified,
nothing affirmed.

588
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:10,029
To the Jem'Hadar,
we are nothing more than...

589
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:12,282
than targets to be destroyed.

590
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:14,033
I must not let them
destroy us, Worf--

591
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:15,994
With all due
respect, General,

592
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,121
we do not know
the tactical situation

593
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,457
of the<i> B'Moth</i> yet.

594
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:24,043
We should guard against making
<i>any</i> premature judgments.

595
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:27,547
Of course.

596
00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:40,435
Dismissed.

597
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:53,949
WORF:
Rotarran<i> Combat Log,</i>

598
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:57,410
<i>the 53rd day in the year</i>
<i>of Kahless 999.</i>

599
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,454
<i>We have reached</i>
<i>the Cardassian border</i>

600
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:02,624
<i>and begun our search</i>
<i>for the</i> B'Moth.

601
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:05,210
Helm... keep us at least

602
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,754
five million<i> kellicams</i>
from the border.

603
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,130
Understood.

604
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,049
DAX:
I think I've
got something.

605
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,968
It's hard to make out
through all the interference,

606
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:15,012
but the thermal signature
looks like a ship.

607
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:17,514
It's bearing direct
to starboard

608
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:20,099
at an elevation
of 25 degrees.

609
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,560
It's coming into
visual range.

610
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,353
On screen.

611
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:36,408
TAVANA:
The<i> B'Moth.</i>
Confirmed.

612
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:38,410
Helm, lay in a course
to bring us alongside.

613
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:41,705
Bridge to Medical Ward.
Prepare to receive casualties.

614
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:44,041
Assemble an armed boarding party
in Transporter Room 1.

615
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:46,292
Make a complete search
of all the habitable areas--

616
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:47,460
Hold.

617
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,921
Commander Dax,

618
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:51,214
what side of the border
are they on?

619
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:55,260
They're 500,000<i> kellicams</i>
inside Cardassian
territory, sir.

620
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,930
They must have drifted across
a couple of days ago.

621
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:01,934
There are probably
five Jem'Hadar warships

622
00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:03,810
out there right now

623
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,354
just waiting for us
to cross the border.

624
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:09,315
General, if they are nearby,

625
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,693
they do not care what side
of the border we are on.

626
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,361
They will simply attack.

627
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,321
I have explicit orders
from the High Council

628
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:17,198
not to enter
Cardassian territory.

629
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:18,825
I am certain the High Council

630
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,744
will not object
under these circumstances.

631
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:22,412
There are still survivors
aboard the<i> B'Moth.</i>

632
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,372
We do not know that.

633
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,708
All that we know is there is
an automated distress call.

634
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:30,003
They could all be dead by now.
And if they are not?

635
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:34,800
Then there is nothing
we can do for them.

636
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,512
General, you don't intend
to just leave them there?

637
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:42,515
I will not throw away
the lives of this crew

638
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,851
in a futile rescue attempt.

639
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,186
They are Klingon warriors.
We just cannot sit--

640
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:51,524
I have made my decision!
We will not cross the border!

641
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,238
From this moment,
anyone who questions that--

642
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,949
<i>anyone--</i>

643
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:02,035
will be charged
with treasonable disobedience.

644
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:06,665
Worf...

645
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:08,458
you have the Bridge.

646
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:21,346
(<i> Leskit chuckling</i> )

647
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,141
Stations!

648
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,563
Stations!

649
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:38,030
We can't just leave those
men out there to die.

650
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,906
No.

651
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,658
So what are you
going to do?

652
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:43,242
The only thing I can do--

653
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:46,038
challenge Martok
for command of the ship.

654
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:48,123
I agree.

655
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:51,584
But you realize, he may
not step aside willingly.

656
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,211
I know.

657
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,089
But if the General
will not step aside...

658
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:00,385
I will have to kill him.

659
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:35,670
Martok must die.

660
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,714
That is not your decision.

661
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:40,299
He is a coward.

662
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:43,970
While he commands,
he dishonors us all.

663
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:47,682
I shed no tears
for your dishonor, Leskit.

664
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:54,064
Today would be a bad day
to die, son of Mogh.

665
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:57,358
Take your
Trill and go.

666
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:05,242
Unlikely.

667
00:38:05,242 --> 00:38:10,163
I was hoping you would say
something like that.

668
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:11,372
(<i> door opens</i> )

669
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:20,173
Alert Status One.

670
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:22,467
All hands to battle stations.

671
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:25,553
We are going to rescue
the survivors of the<i> B'Moth.</i>

(<i> alarm blares</i> )

673
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:34,395
Who gave the order...?
What's going on here?

674
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:38,150
As First Officer,
I say that you are unfit
to serve as Captain.

675
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:40,110
You what?

676
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:43,071
You are a coward,

677
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:45,364
and I challenge you
for command of this ship.

678
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:49,702
I never would have expected
this from you, Worf.

679

Tactical alert!
Tactical alert!

687
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:12,952
There is a Jem'Hadar warship
bearing 180 mark 215.

688
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:16,122
They will be within weapons
range in nine minutes.

689
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:22,461
The Jem'Hadar will soon learn
to regret this day.

690
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:24,381
Who is with me?!

691
00:40:24,381 --> 00:40:26,091
Tavana!

692
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:29,468
Sometimes... I think
I know why I love you.

693
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,179
Let's go to the
Medical Ward.

KORNAN:
Shields and
weapons ready.

695
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:34,015

How's the intelligence

Oh, I can't talk about it.

720
00:41:33,283 --> 00:41:35,327
All I can do is read
these fascinating reports

721
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:37,120
and analyses,
and analyses of analyses,

722
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,746
and then
keep it all to myself

723
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,748
because no one else
has "a need to know."

724
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,208
So I have to walk
around this station

00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,668
feeling like I, uh...

726
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:46,087
You don't really care,
do you?
No.

It's the<i> Rotarran.</i>
Martok's ship.

730
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,054
Yes, sir, and there's
an incoming transmission.

On screen.

732
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,267
Major, we've rescued
35 survivors

00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:01,644
of a disabled
Klingon battle cruiser.

734
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:04,647
Request permission to beam them
directly to your Infirmary.

735
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:06,399
Permission granted, General.

736
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:08,276
You're also cleared
to dock at Bay 4.

737
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:10,111
We'll need an engineering team

738
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:13,781
to repair our battle damage,
and one other thing.

739
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,908
Arrange to have
15 barrels of bloodwine

740

waiting for us at the airlock

741
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:20,538
so that we can celebrate
the first victory

General.

747

The High Council
has issued a commendation

for the entire crew
of the<i> Rotarran.</i>

749
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:48,900
It would seem
that you were right.

750
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,403
They view the destruction
of a Jem'Hadar ship

751
00:42:51,403 --> 00:42:54,531
and the rescue of 35 warriors
as ample justification

752
00:42:54,531 --> 00:42:56,866
for crossing
the Cardassian border.

753
00:42:56,866 --> 00:43:01,204
Your... actions
on the<i> Rotarran--</i>

754
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:03,540
at the time,
I thought they were disloyal

755
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:06,042
but I have come
to realize

756
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:08,294
that your intention
was to remind me of my duty

757
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:10,338
as a soldier of the Empire
and as a warrior.

758
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:12,340
For that, I am grateful.

759
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,217
You did the same
for me once.

760
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:15,843
Worf...

761
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:19,931
on the Bridge,
during the fight,

762
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:22,141
when you dropped
your guard,

763
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:25,061
how did you know
I would not kill you?

764
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,192
I did not know.

(<i> chuckling</i> )

766
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,281
I see you're still wearing

767
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:38,074
the crest
of the House of Mogh.

768
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:42,995
Yes.

769
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:46,541
Jadzia calls it
a... sentimental gesture.

770
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:52,589
Ah. Perhaps you would consider
replacing sentiment with...

771
00:43:52,589 --> 00:43:55,508
the symbol
of a new beginning.

772
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:01,556
The House of Martok

773
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:03,808
would be honored

774
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:06,978

into our family

775
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:08,271
as a warrior...

776
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,107
