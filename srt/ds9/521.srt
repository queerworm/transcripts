1
00:00:02,197 --> 00:00:03,461
Another three centimeters
to the right

2
00:00:03,499 --> 00:00:05,162
and you would have severed
your brachial artery.

3
00:00:05,203 --> 00:00:06,296
Autosuture, please.

4
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:07,398
And if that had happened,

5
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:09,434
you would have bled to death
right there in the holosuite.

6
00:00:10,548 --> 00:00:12,849
The human fascination
with "what might have been"

7
00:00:12,886 --> 00:00:14,081
is tiresome, Doctor.

8
00:00:14,123 --> 00:00:16,287
The artery is not severed
and I am not dead.

9
00:00:16,328 --> 00:00:18,195
Oh, well, forgive me
for boring you.

10
00:00:18,265 --> 00:00:19,529
Let me get straight
to the point.

11
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:20,796
You're acting like a fool.

12
00:00:20,837 --> 00:00:23,172
Your observation is noted.

13
00:00:23,209 --> 00:00:25,874
But spending two years
in a Dominion prison camp

14
00:00:25,915 --> 00:00:27,441
has dulled my reflexes.

15
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,615
This only proves that
I need further training.

16
00:00:29,657 --> 00:00:31,855
Turning off the holosuite
safety protocols

17
00:00:31,895 --> 00:00:34,492
during a battle simulation
is, at best, dubious.

18
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,971
For a man with only one eye,
it's positively idiotic.

19
00:00:37,006 --> 00:00:39,705
Now, if you would consider
ocular replacement...

20
00:00:39,746 --> 00:00:42,685
I do not want
an artificial eye!

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,384
Then you must accept the fact
that you have a disability

22
00:00:45,424 --> 00:00:46,517
and stop acting like...

23
00:00:46,561 --> 00:00:51,903
There are limits as to how far
I will indulge you, Doctor.

24
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:54,744
General Martok, there is

25
00:00:54,779 --> 00:00:57,376
a priority message for you
from the Klingon High Council.

26
00:00:59,122 --> 00:01:00,523
We're done here.

27
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,157
Route the message
to my quarters.

28
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:05,326
Acknowledged.

29
00:01:05,368 --> 00:01:07,862
Doctor... thank you.

30
00:01:07,907 --> 00:01:09,342
If you really
want to thank me

31
00:01:09,377 --> 00:01:11,244
don't walk in here
dripping blood anymore.

32
00:01:11,314 --> 00:01:13,341
It takes days to get it
out of the carpet.

33
00:01:25,947 --> 00:01:27,416
Check it now.

34
00:01:29,021 --> 00:01:32,188
Still no increase in phaser
relay efficiency, sir.

35
00:01:32,228 --> 00:01:35,463
The through-put reading
is steady at 148.7.

36
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:38,872
Have you initialized
the interface program?

37
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:41,039
Yes, and then I charged
the prefire chamber

38
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,845
and recalibrated
the emitter stage.

39
00:01:42,884 --> 00:01:44,980
This thing just doesn't work!

40
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,047
Sir.

41
00:01:47,661 --> 00:01:49,324
Very well.

42
00:01:49,432 --> 00:01:50,958
We'll start over.

43
00:01:51,002 --> 00:01:52,301
Go to the Engine Room

44
00:01:52,339 --> 00:01:53,808
and download
the operating system

45
00:01:53,841 --> 00:01:55,140
into the computer core

46
00:01:55,178 --> 00:01:57,809
but, this time,
do it one file at a time.

47
00:01:59,922 --> 00:02:01,448
Aye, sir.

48
00:02:04,198 --> 00:02:05,724
Good evening, General.

49
00:02:05,768 --> 00:02:06,861
Cadet.

50
00:02:06,904 --> 00:02:08,237
General.

51
00:02:10,344 --> 00:02:13,043
I did not expect you
until 2200 hours.

52
00:02:13,084 --> 00:02:15,282
I must cancel our appointment.

53
00:02:15,322 --> 00:02:17,053
I've received new orders
from the High Council...

54
00:02:17,092 --> 00:02:18,823
a mission of some importance.

55
00:02:18,863 --> 00:02:19,956
I must prepare.

56
00:02:19,999 --> 00:02:21,126
Of course.

57
00:02:21,168 --> 00:02:23,662
May glory and honor
follow you on your journey.

58
00:02:24,676 --> 00:02:26,772
Ah... excuse me, sirs?

59
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:29,912
Could I just slip by?

60
00:02:36,903 --> 00:02:38,372
How is the shoulder?

61
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,141
Oh, Dr. Bashir made
the necessary repairs.

62
00:02:42,181 --> 00:02:44,117
I told him it was
a holosuite accident.

63
00:02:44,152 --> 00:02:46,054
He would not understand
the need to draw blood

64
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,584
in a warrior's
training exercise.

65
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:49,996
Few humans would.

66
00:02:50,032 --> 00:02:54,269
However, I do apologize again
for the inconvenience.

67
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:56,175
I did not intend
to cause so much damage.

68
00:02:56,212 --> 00:02:59,708
I was the one who did not
parry the blow in time.

69
00:02:59,753 --> 00:03:01,986
A simple, foolish mistake

70
00:03:02,025 --> 00:03:03,927
one that I would not have made
two years ago.

71
00:03:03,962 --> 00:03:06,058
Can you discuss the mission?

72
00:03:08,004 --> 00:03:12,173
Three days ago,
the Battle Cruiser <i>B'Moth</i>

73
00:03:12,213 --> 00:03:15,380
began a patrol
along the Cardassian border.

74
00:03:15,454 --> 00:03:18,894
They have not been
heard from since.

75
00:03:18,928 --> 00:03:21,126
They are now reported
as missing.

76
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:24,504
It is possible she was
destroyed by the Dominion.

77
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:27,138
The Jem'Hadar attacked
a Federation starship

78
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,774
near the border
less than a week ago.

79
00:03:28,817 --> 00:03:31,847
That is our assumption
as well, but we must be sure.

80
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,723
So I have been given command

81
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:36,962
of a bird-of-prey...
the <i>Rotarran...</i>

82
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:38,800
to conduct a search
for the <i>B'Moth.</i>

83
00:03:38,839 --> 00:03:40,331
This is the first time

84
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:44,146
I will have led troops
in the field since...

85
00:03:44,184 --> 00:03:47,180
my confinement by the Dominion.

86
00:03:47,224 --> 00:03:49,457
It must be an exciting prospect.

87
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:52,435
I tell you, Worf...
without shame...

88
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:55,202
there were days
in that prison camp

89
00:03:55,242 --> 00:03:57,770
when the thought that
I would never again

90
00:03:57,814 --> 00:04:03,053
set foot in a Klingon vessel
made me weep like an old woman.

91
00:04:03,092 --> 00:04:05,996
I envy you the days ahead.

92
00:04:06,032 --> 00:04:08,002
It will be a glorious adventure.

93
00:04:08,036 --> 00:04:12,741
An adventure that we
could share, my friend.

94
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,753
I need someone I can
trust at my side

95
00:04:15,787 --> 00:04:18,350
someone whose loyalty
I can count on.

96
00:04:19,996 --> 00:04:22,297
Worf, son of Mogh

97
00:04:22,334 --> 00:04:25,466
I ask you to join me
on this mission

98
00:04:25,508 --> 00:04:27,307
as my friend...

99
00:04:27,345 --> 00:04:30,341
and as my First Officer.

100
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:35,518
I've told the General
that I'm inclined

101
00:06:35,554 --> 00:06:38,755
to grant his request
for your services, Commander.

102
00:06:38,794 --> 00:06:41,790
I can certainly understand
why he wants you along.

103
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:43,361
You're a fine officer.

104
00:06:43,405 --> 00:06:44,566
But I'm not sure

105
00:06:44,607 --> 00:06:46,668
why you want to go
on this mission.

106
00:06:46,711 --> 00:06:47,940
It is a great honor

107
00:06:47,981 --> 00:06:50,452
to be asked to serve
under General Martok.

108
00:06:50,486 --> 00:06:54,757
And he saved my life
in the Dominion prison camp.

109
00:06:54,796 --> 00:06:57,233
Oh? You didn't put that
in your mission report.

110
00:06:57,268 --> 00:06:59,295
It was a personal matter.

111
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,641
Not something that belongs
in an official report.

112
00:07:01,677 --> 00:07:03,271
Go on.

113
00:07:03,314 --> 00:07:05,307
You know that I was
forced to fight

114
00:07:05,353 --> 00:07:07,289
the Jem'Hadar guards
in the camp.

115
00:07:07,323 --> 00:07:09,259
Each day they would
call me to the ring

116
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:10,958
and each day I would fight

117
00:07:10,999 --> 00:07:15,965
but then there came a day
when I... wavered.

118
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,811
You mean you didn't want
to go back into the ring?

119
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:21,913
No. I mean I considered
letting them kill me.

120
00:07:21,956 --> 00:07:24,223
It seemed like the only way out.

121
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,820
Just before I went into the ring

122
00:07:25,864 --> 00:07:27,994
Martok turned to wish me success

123
00:07:28,036 --> 00:07:29,665
and then he saw
what I was planning...

124
00:07:29,706 --> 00:07:31,642
he saw it in my eyes.

125
00:07:31,677 --> 00:07:34,012
It was a moment of <i>tova'dok.</i>

126
00:07:34,049 --> 00:07:35,348
Of what?

127
00:07:35,385 --> 00:07:38,084
There is no human word for it.

128
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,393
It is a moment of... clarity

129
00:07:41,432 --> 00:07:43,801
between two warriors
on a field of battle.

130
00:07:43,837 --> 00:07:45,830
Much is said
without the need for words.

131
00:07:45,874 --> 00:07:49,245
In that moment,
he knew what was in my mind.

132
00:07:49,282 --> 00:07:52,278
Once I realized that he saw
my intention to give up

133
00:07:52,322 --> 00:07:54,520
I could no longer
go through with it.

134
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:57,534
I went back into the ring
and fought once more.

135
00:07:57,633 --> 00:08:00,597
He had given me
his warrior's heart.

136
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,634
Perhaps it is something
a human cannot understand.

137
00:08:12,156 --> 00:08:14,058
As of this moment

138
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:16,462
you are relieved
of all Starfleet obligations

139
00:08:16,498 --> 00:08:18,491
and placed on detached service

140
00:08:18,537 --> 00:08:20,974
to the Imperial Klingon
Defense Forces.

141
00:08:23,614 --> 00:08:25,778
Thank you, sir.

142
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:27,311
Mr. Worf.

143
00:08:30,028 --> 00:08:31,429
<i>Qapla'!</i>

144
00:08:32,768 --> 00:08:34,169
<i>Qapla'!</i>

145
00:08:53,246 --> 00:08:55,182
The revised duty roster.

146
00:08:55,216 --> 00:08:56,981
Read it and weep.

147
00:08:57,021 --> 00:08:59,754
Small arms recalibration?

148
00:08:59,794 --> 00:09:01,491
Does that mean all
the small arms on the station?

149
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:02,499
Afraid so.

150
00:09:02,533 --> 00:09:05,164
And I need an experienced
combat officer to do it.

151
00:09:05,205 --> 00:09:06,606
Worf has already set up
the parameters.

152
00:09:06,642 --> 00:09:08,407
All you need to do
is just make sure it gets done.

153
00:09:08,445 --> 00:09:10,882
I'm the new
Intelligence Officer?

154
00:09:12,721 --> 00:09:14,190
It has to be a Starfleet officer

155
00:09:14,225 --> 00:09:15,785
with a level-4
security clearance.

156
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:17,196
That means either you or Dax

157
00:09:17,232 --> 00:09:20,171
and I need Dax to take over
as Fleet Liaison Officer.

158
00:09:20,205 --> 00:09:21,469
Beats retuning phaser rifles.

159
00:09:21,508 --> 00:09:24,275
Well, I certainly hope
Worf's enjoying himself

160
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:27,150
while we're stuck here
taking over his duties.

161
00:09:27,187 --> 00:09:29,954
Julian, have you ever been
on a Klingon ship?

162
00:09:29,993 --> 00:09:32,430
If you think the <i>Defiant</i>
is cramped and uncomfortable

163
00:09:32,465 --> 00:09:34,732
try spending a week
on a bird-of-prey.

164
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37,241
Worf isn't exactly
taking a luxury cruise.

165
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:38,609
Serving on a Klingon ship

166
00:09:38,646 --> 00:09:40,947
is like being with a gang
of ancient sea pirates.

167
00:09:40,984 --> 00:09:43,888
You advance in rank by
killing the people above you.

168
00:09:43,924 --> 00:09:44,983
So everywhere you turn

169
00:09:45,026 --> 00:09:46,757
you're surrounded
by potential assassins.

170
00:09:46,796 --> 00:09:47,764
Well, that's crazy.

171
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:48,994
How can a ship
function like that?

172
00:09:49,035 --> 00:09:50,902
It's not quite that chaotic.

173
00:09:50,939 --> 00:09:53,433
The social and military
hierarchy of a Klingon vessel

174
00:09:53,478 --> 00:09:55,107
is very strictly enforced.

175
00:09:55,215 --> 00:09:58,882
A subordinate can only
challenge a direct superior

176
00:09:58,924 --> 00:10:00,119
and only under
certain conditions.

177
00:10:00,226 --> 00:10:02,561
What sort of "conditions"?

178
00:10:02,598 --> 00:10:04,591
Dereliction of duty

179
00:10:04,636 --> 00:10:07,803
dishonorable conduct,
cowardice...

180
00:10:07,843 --> 00:10:10,144
Cowardice? A Klingon?

181
00:10:10,214 --> 00:10:11,478
It's been known to happen.

182
00:10:11,518 --> 00:10:13,921
The Klingons are
as diverse a people as any.

183
00:10:13,957 --> 00:10:16,155
Some of them are strong,
and some of them are weak.

184
00:10:16,195 --> 00:10:18,062
I'd say those two

185
00:10:18,099 --> 00:10:21,402
definitely fall
into the strong category.

186
00:10:35,504 --> 00:10:37,030
Trouble?

187
00:10:37,074 --> 00:10:38,167
Not yet.

188
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,975
I can see why they
caught your attention.

189
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,313
Are they off Martok's new ship?

190
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,217
Just docked.

191
00:10:43,287 --> 00:10:44,881
They seem quiet enough.

192
00:10:44,924 --> 00:10:47,327
For the moment, maybe

193
00:10:47,363 --> 00:10:49,926
but you see the one on the left
wearing the necklace?

194
00:10:49,969 --> 00:10:51,495
Yes.

195
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:53,008
Those are neck bones...

196
00:10:53,043 --> 00:10:54,603
Cardassian neck bones.

197
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:03,428
Decided not to wear
the sash after all?

198
00:11:03,465 --> 00:11:05,993
Officially, there is no
House of Mogh in the Empire

199
00:11:06,037 --> 00:11:07,027
so I saw little point

200
00:11:07,074 --> 00:11:09,044
in wearing its emblem
on a Klingon ship.

201
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:11,048
How do you think
the crew's going to feel

202
00:11:11,082 --> 00:11:13,143
about serving under a man
without a House?

203
00:11:13,187 --> 00:11:15,351
How they feel is unimportant.

204
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:18,489
All I require from them
is obedience.

205
00:11:18,531 --> 00:11:21,094
Spoken like an uncaring,
hard-nosed autocrat...

206
00:11:21,137 --> 00:11:23,039
the quintessential
First Officer.

207
00:11:24,946 --> 00:11:27,919
I-I do not wish
to have a lengthy good-bye.

208
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:30,983
I wasn't planning
on having one.

209
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:32,358
Good.

210
00:11:44,088 --> 00:11:45,283
Jadzia.

211
00:11:45,357 --> 00:11:46,917
Yes.

212
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,293
I think it would be better

213
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,266
to part company
here on the station.

214
00:11:50,301 --> 00:11:51,793
Oh, I'm coming with you.

215
00:11:51,838 --> 00:11:53,205
What?

216
00:11:53,241 --> 00:11:55,234
The <i>Rotarran</i> is shorthanded

217
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,648
and I still have
four months leave coming.

218
00:11:57,684 --> 00:12:00,281
And I've already cleared it
with Martok and Benjamin.

219
00:12:00,323 --> 00:12:01,883
I'm your new Science Officer.

220
00:12:01,927 --> 00:12:04,057
Why did you not tell me?

221
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,829
It's more fun this way.

222
00:12:05,869 --> 00:12:07,566
And after getting a good look

223
00:12:07,606 --> 00:12:10,237
at a couple members
of the <i>Rotarran's</i> crew

224
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:13,479
I don't think we're going
to be having a lot of fun

225
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,318
on this mission.

226
00:12:36,403 --> 00:12:37,371
Boo!

227
00:12:42,182 --> 00:12:46,283
<i>Ros-te-ka cha'Domak</i>
<i>ootha Trill?</i>

228
00:12:46,324 --> 00:12:48,557
I am Tavana,
Engineering Officer.

229
00:12:48,596 --> 00:12:50,931
I'm Jadzia Dax, Science Officer.

230
00:12:50,968 --> 00:12:52,335
Dax?

231
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:54,501
Are you related
to the great Curzon Dax?

232
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:56,911
Curzon was the last host
for my symbiont.

233
00:12:56,947 --> 00:12:58,176
I carry his memories.

234
00:12:58,217 --> 00:12:59,185
Ah!

235
00:12:59,219 --> 00:13:04,060
My mother met the great Curzon
on the Homeworld once.

236
00:13:04,097 --> 00:13:06,261
She said he was
very taken with her.

237
00:13:06,301 --> 00:13:10,538
Curzon was very "taken"
with many people.

238
00:13:10,578 --> 00:13:12,445
So was my mother.

239
00:13:25,477 --> 00:13:27,812
I am Worf, son of Mogh.

240
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:32,622
I now take my place
as First Officer.

241
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:36,258
I serve the Captain,
but I stand for the crew.

242
00:13:37,637 --> 00:13:40,974
Who brings the record of battle
for this ship?

243
00:13:51,935 --> 00:13:54,168
I, Kornan, son of Shovak

244
00:13:54,207 --> 00:13:56,040
Weapon's Officer
of the ship of <i>Rotarran</i>

245
00:13:56,077 --> 00:13:57,808
present the glorious record
of our honor

246
00:13:57,848 --> 00:14:00,319
and hope that you may find us
worthy of your leadership.

247
00:14:07,001 --> 00:14:09,199
If you're looking for victories,
you won't find any.

248
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,711
Not for the last seven months.

249
00:14:11,745 --> 00:14:16,119
I do not need help recognizing
a list of failures.

250
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:21,396
It is clear to me

251
00:14:21,433 --> 00:14:25,374
that none of you are worthy
of my blood or my life.

252
00:14:26,745 --> 00:14:29,273
But I will stand for you

253
00:14:29,317 --> 00:14:32,415
and together, we will restore
honor to this ship

254
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,895
and bring glory to the Empire.

255
00:14:45,286 --> 00:14:46,721
Ah...

256
00:14:52,034 --> 00:14:54,198
I have accepted
the crew's battle records

257
00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:57,040
and on their behalf,
I pledge you our lives

258
00:14:57,078 --> 00:15:00,381
and ask that you lead us
as Commander of this ship.

259
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:09,628
I accept your lives
into my hands.

260
00:15:09,672 --> 00:15:11,266
<i>De-lak DoH!</i>

261
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,372
Clear all moorings.

262
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:15,680
Release docking clamps.

263
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,587
Docking clamps released.

264
00:15:17,624 --> 00:15:19,594
Bow thrusters ahead
one half.

265
00:15:21,164 --> 00:15:23,260
We have cleared
the docking ring.

266
00:15:23,303 --> 00:15:26,276
Ahead one-quarter impulse.

267
00:15:30,886 --> 00:15:32,822
Helmsman, plot a direct course

268
00:15:32,857 --> 00:15:35,658
to the last known position
of the <i>B'Moth,</i> maximum warp.

269
00:15:35,696 --> 00:15:38,532
No. That would take us
through the Tong Beak Nebula.

270
00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:40,334
I want to go around the nebula.

271
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:43,346
General, that will add
a full day to our journey.

272
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,849
I'm aware of that.

273
00:15:44,884 --> 00:15:46,649
There are reports
of the Dominion

274
00:15:46,688 --> 00:15:48,317
operating ships in the nebula.

275
00:15:48,358 --> 00:15:50,955
I would like to avoid
a fight with the Jem'Hadar.

276
00:15:52,266 --> 00:15:54,931
You wish to... avoid a fight?

277
00:15:55,941 --> 00:16:00,042
Your tone does not sit well
with me, Helmsman.

278
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:03,882
Our mission
is to find the <i>B'Moth</i>

279
00:16:03,925 --> 00:16:06,378
not to satisfy
your warrior's pride.

280
00:16:06,511 --> 00:16:08,276
My apologies, sir.

281
00:16:08,316 --> 00:16:10,617
I meant no disrespect.

282
00:16:10,654 --> 00:16:12,955
Then follow your orders
and lay in a course.

283
00:16:12,992 --> 00:16:14,256
Maximum warp.

284
00:16:14,296 --> 00:16:15,856
Yes, Commander.

285
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:19,395
Maximum warp, around...

286
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,342
the nebula.

287
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,113
Helm ready.

288
00:16:28,327 --> 00:16:29,956
<i>Mahk-cha.</i>

300
00:17:37,846 --> 00:17:39,281
Maybe you didn't read

301
00:17:39,383 --> 00:17:42,788
the crew roster,
but my name is Dax

302
00:17:42,823 --> 00:17:45,294
and I'm the new Science Officer
on this garbage scow

303
00:17:45,396 --> 00:17:48,266
and you were in my seat.

304
00:17:50,206 --> 00:17:52,677
I'm glad we understand
each other.

305
00:17:52,712 --> 00:17:55,183
Now get... down
to the other end

306
00:17:55,217 --> 00:17:56,709
where you belong.

307
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:03,768
Stewed bok-rat liver?

308
00:18:03,803 --> 00:18:05,864
It's not very fresh.

309
00:18:05,908 --> 00:18:09,974
With a little bloodwine,
it might be acceptable.

310
00:18:10,016 --> 00:18:14,117
Ha. There's been no bloodwine
on this ship for six months.

311
00:18:14,158 --> 00:18:15,491
Really?

312
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:18,091
Then I'm glad
I brought three barrels aboard

313
00:18:18,134 --> 00:18:20,298
before we left Deep Space 9.

314
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,944
Three barrels?

315
00:18:26,152 --> 00:18:27,985
"Dishonorable conduct.

316
00:18:28,022 --> 00:18:29,651
"Dereliction of duty.

317
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:31,287
"Inattention to orders.

318
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,765
"Unmotivated.

319
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,964
Insufficiently aggressive."

320
00:18:35,004 --> 00:18:39,036
These personnel reports
read like prison records.

321
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,070
We should remember

322
00:18:40,116 --> 00:18:41,779
that the <i>Rotarran</i>
has been defeated

323
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,346
again and again
by the Jem'Hadar.

324
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:46,361
It is not surprising
the crew morale has suffered.

325
00:18:46,396 --> 00:18:49,335
It's more than a case
of low morale, Worf.

326
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:52,137
This crew has been defeated
so many times

327
00:18:52,176 --> 00:18:56,709
they expect defeat,
and that is dangerous.

328
00:18:56,752 --> 00:18:58,882
They need a victory.

329
00:18:58,924 --> 00:19:00,951
One decisive battle
against the Jem'Hadar

330
00:19:00,995 --> 00:19:02,828
would do much
to lift their spirits.

331
00:19:04,202 --> 00:19:05,694
And mine.

332
00:19:09,046 --> 00:19:13,785
No one hungers
for a victory over the Jem'Hadar

333
00:19:13,823 --> 00:19:18,026
more than I do... no one...

334
00:19:18,066 --> 00:19:20,367
but we must be cautious.

335
00:19:20,404 --> 00:19:23,035
We cannot risk
taking this crew into combat

336
00:19:23,077 --> 00:19:24,376
before they're ready.

337
00:19:24,447 --> 00:19:25,882
They will be ready.

338
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,385
I will see to that.

339
00:19:27,453 --> 00:19:29,320
I know you will, my friend.

340
00:19:29,358 --> 00:19:31,693
Together,
we will make the <i>Rotarran</i>

341
00:19:31,729 --> 00:19:35,396
an honorable ship again,
a ship worthy of the Empire.

342
00:19:35,437 --> 00:19:38,501
You may return
to your station.

343
00:19:44,557 --> 00:19:46,220
The Cardassians were trapped

344
00:19:46,261 --> 00:19:48,094
between us
and the asteroid field.

345
00:19:48,132 --> 00:19:49,259
It was perfect.

346
00:19:49,301 --> 00:19:50,530
Their power was failing.

347
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,199
They had no other ships nearby

348
00:19:52,241 --> 00:19:54,234
and our weapons
were fully charged.

349
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:57,649
And we were still denied
a victory.

350
00:19:57,687 --> 00:20:01,218
Three Jem'Hadar ships appeared
from out of the asteroid field.

351
00:20:01,261 --> 00:20:02,992
Three to one are long odds.

352
00:20:03,031 --> 00:20:04,796
I'd say you did well just...

353
00:20:04,835 --> 00:20:06,999
getting away
with your ship in one piece.

354
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,172
Getting away is something
we've become very good at.

355
00:20:10,214 --> 00:20:11,979
The <i>Rotarran</i>
can run away from battle

356
00:20:12,018 --> 00:20:13,817
faster than any ship
in the Quadrant.

357
00:20:13,855 --> 00:20:16,224
You never could handle
your bloodwine, Leskit.

358
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,493
You sound
like a sniveling Ferengi

359
00:20:18,566 --> 00:20:20,331
crying about lost profit.

360
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:22,864
That's supposed
to wound my pride

361
00:20:22,908 --> 00:20:24,878
but Tavana has forgotten

362
00:20:24,912 --> 00:20:27,281
that no one serving
on the <i>Rotarran</i>

363
00:20:27,318 --> 00:20:28,787
has any pride left.

364
00:20:28,821 --> 00:20:31,122
Does that include me?

365
00:20:33,364 --> 00:20:37,065
I do not wish to insult someone
who brought me wine

366
00:20:37,106 --> 00:20:39,475
but one does wonder

367
00:20:39,512 --> 00:20:42,451
why the successor
to the great Curzon Dax

368
00:20:42,484 --> 00:20:45,753
would consent to serve
upon a ship like this.

369
00:20:45,792 --> 00:20:47,352
It's no mystery.

370
00:20:47,395 --> 00:20:49,798
She's the <i>parmach'kai</i>
of our new First Officer.

371
00:20:49,834 --> 00:20:53,866
I heard it on the space station
before we left.

372
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,746
Worf is only part
of the reason I'm here.

373
00:20:56,782 --> 00:21:00,587
I think it is an honor
to serve under General Martok.

374
00:21:00,624 --> 00:21:02,321
You mean the one-eyed giant?

375
00:21:03,397 --> 00:21:05,960
I wouldn't let him
hear you say that.

376
00:21:06,002 --> 00:21:07,403
He won't.

377
00:21:07,439 --> 00:21:10,070
Unless Worf is not the only one

378
00:21:10,112 --> 00:21:12,709
you're sharing a bed with
this trip.

379
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,515
On this trip

380
00:21:14,555 --> 00:21:16,924
my bed is as empty as yours,
Leskit

381
00:21:16,961 --> 00:21:20,696
except mine is empty by choice.

382
00:21:22,405 --> 00:21:25,002
Now, that is a sound
I haven't heard

383
00:21:25,044 --> 00:21:27,140
on this ship for a long time.

384
00:21:27,183 --> 00:21:29,085
It won't last.

385
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:34,029
This ship is made for tears,
not laughter.

386
00:21:34,064 --> 00:21:37,060
You're really not much fun
at parties, are you, Kornan?

387
00:21:37,105 --> 00:21:38,904
Make your jokes.

388
00:21:38,942 --> 00:21:42,883
Hold off fate for another day
if you can

389
00:21:42,918 --> 00:21:48,386
but this ship and all the souls
within its hull are cursed.

390
00:21:48,429 --> 00:21:50,627
Death and dishonor

391
00:21:50,734 --> 00:21:53,205
walk these corridors
like members of the crew.

392
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,142
Aw, you talk too much, Kornan.

393
00:21:55,177 --> 00:21:57,044
Tell me you
don't believe it, too.

394
00:21:59,286 --> 00:22:00,915
We've cloaked.

395
00:22:00,957 --> 00:22:03,053
Alert Status One.

396
00:22:03,095 --> 00:22:05,065
A Jem'Hadar patrol ship
is directly ahead.

397
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:07,069
Prepare for combat operations.

398
00:22:10,645 --> 00:22:12,342
Now you will see.

399
00:22:12,382 --> 00:22:16,847
Either death or dishonor
will visit us this day

400
00:22:16,891 --> 00:22:20,524
and there will be nothing
that you or I

401
00:22:20,567 --> 00:22:23,038
or any of us can do about it.

402
00:22:33,328 --> 00:22:35,298
What are they doing here

403
00:22:35,332 --> 00:22:37,667
this far
from the Cardassian border?

404
00:22:37,737 --> 00:22:38,796
They're conducting

405
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,571
active polaron scans
of this sector.

406
00:22:40,611 --> 00:22:43,412
It's likely they're on some kind
of reconnaissance mission.

407
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,887
Can their scans penetrate
our cloak?

408
00:22:45,922 --> 00:22:46,890
I'd say there's less

409
00:22:46,924 --> 00:22:48,689
than a three percent
chance of detection.

410
00:22:48,796 --> 00:22:50,265
What's our weapons status?

411
00:22:50,298 --> 00:22:52,200
Torpedo bays are loaded.
Warheads are armed.

412
00:22:52,236 --> 00:22:54,707
Disruptors are locked on target.

413
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:55,640
They've increased speed.

414
00:22:55,677 --> 00:22:57,169
They're beginning to pull away.

415
00:22:57,214 --> 00:22:58,375
Shall I match velocity?

416
00:22:59,686 --> 00:23:00,813
No.

417
00:23:00,855 --> 00:23:03,520
Take us back
to our original course.

418
00:23:03,561 --> 00:23:07,228
Forgive this unworthy officer's
poor hearing

419
00:23:07,269 --> 00:23:09,068
but what was your order?

420
00:23:09,107 --> 00:23:11,544
Take us back
to our original course!

421
00:23:11,579 --> 00:23:15,178
Our priority
is to find the <i>B'Moth.</i>

422
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,531
Sir, we have them in our sights.

423
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:23,537
They cannot escape if...

424
00:23:23,571 --> 00:23:24,561
No, Worf.

425
00:23:24,608 --> 00:23:25,907
But letting the ship go...

426
00:23:25,943 --> 00:23:27,537
Do not question me!

427
00:23:29,084 --> 00:23:30,713
Is the course laid in?

428
00:23:30,754 --> 00:23:31,983
Yes, Captain.

429
00:23:32,023 --> 00:23:34,517
I await your next command.

430
00:23:34,562 --> 00:23:37,558
Engage.

431
00:23:45,754 --> 00:23:48,225
Stand down from Alert Status.

432
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:50,092
You have the Bridge.

433
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:56,809
Commander.

434
00:24:00,887 --> 00:24:02,143
That was a mistake.

435
00:24:02,276 --> 00:24:03,768
We shouldn't have let them go.

436
00:24:03,812 --> 00:24:08,049
Our orders are to find
the <i>B'Moth,</i> not seek combat.

437
00:24:08,089 --> 00:24:10,059
It was a prudent decision.

438
00:24:10,093 --> 00:24:11,790
To hell with prudence.

439
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,493
This isn't
a Federation starship.

440
00:24:13,601 --> 00:24:15,434
This is a Klingon bird-of-prey.

441
00:24:15,471 --> 00:24:17,338
We could've had an easy victory

442
00:24:17,376 --> 00:24:20,713
and in case you haven't noticed,
this crew could use a victory.

443
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,185
Enough.

444
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,188
You may be my <i>parmach'kai</i>

445
00:24:23,222 --> 00:24:24,623
but that does not
give you the right...

446
00:24:24,658 --> 00:24:27,323
I'm an officer on this ship

447
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:29,232
and I am trying
to warn my superior

448
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:31,740
that a dangerous situation
is developing

449
00:24:31,774 --> 00:24:34,337
and that he'd better
do something about it.

450
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,908
What do you mean "dangerous"?

451
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:41,757
Take a good look
around you, Commander.

452
00:24:41,796 --> 00:24:44,359
Maybe it's just me

453
00:24:44,402 --> 00:24:45,894
but I think we're in trouble.

454
00:24:57,998 --> 00:24:59,797
I brought you here to support me

455
00:24:59,836 --> 00:25:01,863
not to undermine my authority.

456
00:25:01,907 --> 00:25:05,005
I am simply trying to point out
that we had an opportunity

457
00:25:05,047 --> 00:25:08,543
to destroy an enemy ship
with little risk to ourselves.

458
00:25:08,588 --> 00:25:10,251
Little risk?

459
00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:14,560
What if they'd have gotten off
a distress call

460
00:25:14,601 --> 00:25:16,298
before we could destroy them?

461
00:25:16,338 --> 00:25:17,807
They could have given away
our position

462
00:25:17,842 --> 00:25:18,810
called in reinforcements.

463
00:25:18,844 --> 00:25:20,575
We would have spent
the next three days

464
00:25:20,682 --> 00:25:21,843
avoiding Jem'Hadar ships

465
00:25:21,884 --> 00:25:24,253
instead of carrying
out our mission.

466
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:27,022
No, my friend.

467
00:25:27,062 --> 00:25:29,431
No...

468
00:25:29,467 --> 00:25:32,440
This was not the right time
for battle.

469
00:25:35,748 --> 00:25:39,883
You question my judgment
in this matter?

470
00:25:40,893 --> 00:25:42,453
No.

471
00:25:42,496 --> 00:25:43,623
Good.

472
00:25:43,698 --> 00:25:47,069
Without your support,
I cannot command this ship.

473
00:25:48,743 --> 00:25:50,770
Tell me...

474
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:53,651
that I have not made a mistake

475
00:25:53,687 --> 00:25:55,554
in making you my First Officer.

476
00:25:55,591 --> 00:25:57,721
You have my full support,
General.

477
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:02,600
I knew you would not fail me,
Worf

478
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,105
and you can rest assured,
I will not fail you.

479
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:21,841
Two years, I spent
on the Cardassian border.

480
00:26:21,883 --> 00:26:25,654
Two years fighting Guls
and Legates and Glinns.

481
00:26:25,725 --> 00:26:28,060
They were cunning enemies.

482
00:26:28,096 --> 00:26:29,793
Always had us chasing

483
00:26:29,834 --> 00:26:32,773
holo-projections
and sensor ghosts.

484
00:26:32,806 --> 00:26:35,676
Everything was a game with them.

485
00:26:35,713 --> 00:26:39,414
Always had a plan
within a plan within a plan

486
00:26:39,454 --> 00:26:41,584
leading to a trap.

487
00:26:41,626 --> 00:26:43,790
It was an honor to kill them.

488
00:26:45,167 --> 00:26:47,468
The Cardassians.

489
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:48,701
Ah!

490
00:26:48,741 --> 00:26:51,908
But you can respect a Cardassian

491
00:26:51,949 --> 00:26:55,947
because he fights for his people

492
00:26:55,991 --> 00:26:59,989
and he follows a code
just like we do

493
00:27:00,033 --> 00:27:04,031
but not the soldiers
of the Dominion

494
00:27:04,076 --> 00:27:06,570
not the Jem'Hadar.

495
00:27:06,615 --> 00:27:10,111
No. They don't fight
for anything.

496
00:27:10,155 --> 00:27:13,686
They fight because they're
designed that way

497
00:27:13,796 --> 00:27:16,597
because they're programmed
to fight.

498
00:27:16,637 --> 00:27:20,202
They have no honor.

499
00:27:20,244 --> 00:27:21,543
You're right.

500
00:27:21,581 --> 00:27:24,611
That's why they're
better than us.

501
00:27:24,654 --> 00:27:25,713
That's enough.

502
00:27:25,757 --> 00:27:27,727
You're on duty in an hour,
and you...

503
00:27:27,761 --> 00:27:30,062
Ah, the Trill doesn't want you
to know the truth

504
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:32,035
my young friend

505
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:36,512
but you deserve to know...
the Jem'Hadar are smarter

506
00:27:36,546 --> 00:27:39,040
they're faster

507
00:27:39,086 --> 00:27:40,680
and they're stronger
than we are.

508
00:27:40,722 --> 00:27:42,749
How can you say these things?!

509
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,759
He's drunk.

510
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:44,761
Ignore him.

511
00:27:44,864 --> 00:27:46,925
No! You listen!

512
00:27:46,969 --> 00:27:49,406
Listen
and maybe learn something!

513
00:27:49,442 --> 00:27:53,109
The Jem'Hadar are the future!

514
00:27:53,149 --> 00:27:54,550
Shut up, Leskit.

515
00:27:54,586 --> 00:27:56,488
You know why?

516
00:27:56,523 --> 00:27:59,359
Because they can break us.

517
00:27:59,397 --> 00:28:02,893
Just like they broke Martok.

518
00:28:02,938 --> 00:28:04,065
That's enough!

519
00:28:04,108 --> 00:28:06,375
She doesn't want you
to know the truth.

520
00:28:06,412 --> 00:28:09,385
Martok fears them.

521
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:13,224
That's why
we didn't attack them.

522
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,127
Martok fears them!

523
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:41,447
Dax. Dax?

524
00:28:41,489 --> 00:28:42,788
What happened?

525
00:28:42,826 --> 00:28:44,125
Are you all right?

526
00:28:44,162 --> 00:28:45,791
I had to take Ortakin
to surgery.

527
00:28:45,833 --> 00:28:47,302
Kornan almost killed him.

528
00:28:47,335 --> 00:28:48,634
Why?

529
00:28:48,672 --> 00:28:50,039
Because Leskit was drunk.

530
00:28:50,075 --> 00:28:51,236
I do not understand.

531
00:28:51,277 --> 00:28:52,404
No, you don't understand

532
00:28:52,446 --> 00:28:54,143
because you're
too busy worrying

533
00:28:54,184 --> 00:28:56,712
about Martok
while the crew is falling apart.

534
00:28:58,961 --> 00:29:02,594
Kornan needed to attack someone
and he lost control

535
00:29:02,636 --> 00:29:04,800
but this is only the beginning.

536
00:29:04,907 --> 00:29:07,777
This crew has lost half
a dozen separate actions

537
00:29:07,814 --> 00:29:08,941
to the Jem'Hadar.

538
00:29:08,983 --> 00:29:11,454
The casualty list
is as long as my arm

539
00:29:11,488 --> 00:29:13,618
and now they're
serving under a man

540
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,790
who seems to have
left more behind

541
00:29:15,831 --> 00:29:17,698
than just an eye
in that prison camp.

542
00:29:17,736 --> 00:29:19,535
Do not speak of the Captain
in that manner.

543
00:29:19,573 --> 00:29:20,802
Not while I am First Officer.

544
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:24,613
Look, I like Martok

545
00:29:24,651 --> 00:29:27,122
but this crew needs a leader

546
00:29:27,156 --> 00:29:29,491
someone who'll remind
them of their duty

547
00:29:29,528 --> 00:29:31,293
as soldiers of the Empire

548
00:29:31,332 --> 00:29:34,362
and they need that leader
right now

549
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:36,308
or I promise you,
they will explode.

550
00:29:36,343 --> 00:29:38,336
It will not come to that!

551
00:29:40,085 --> 00:29:42,249
I know Martok.

552
00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:44,350
He is a great man.

553
00:29:44,394 --> 00:29:47,697
He will not fail us,
but we must give him time.

554
00:29:47,735 --> 00:29:50,502
Time may be the one thing
we don't have, Worf.

555
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:54,242
What happened in that mess hall
could happen all over this ship

556
00:29:54,283 --> 00:29:57,814
and if you think the blood
looks bad on my uniform

557
00:29:57,857 --> 00:30:01,696
wait until the decks
are dripping with it.

558
00:30:14,527 --> 00:30:17,158
Commander, I'm picking up
a Klingon distress call.

559
00:30:17,199 --> 00:30:19,670
It's very faint,
but I might be able to...

560
00:30:19,705 --> 00:30:21,265
It's the <i>B'Moth.</i>

561
00:30:22,645 --> 00:30:24,809
They were attacked...

562
00:30:24,849 --> 00:30:26,945
by the Jem'Hadar
and lost main power.

563
00:30:26,988 --> 00:30:29,357
Heavy casualties.

564
00:30:29,393 --> 00:30:31,192
At least 30 survivors.

565
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,824
In need of assistance.

566
00:30:32,867 --> 00:30:34,234
Emergency power's failing.

567
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,329
The message repeats.

568
00:30:35,373 --> 00:30:36,899
Location?

569
00:30:36,943 --> 00:30:40,850
The signal is coming
from 055 mark 342.

570
00:30:40,884 --> 00:30:42,011
Distance...

571
00:30:42,054 --> 00:30:43,819
at least seven light years.

572
00:30:43,858 --> 00:30:47,799
Helm, alter course
to 055 mark 342.

573
00:30:47,834 --> 00:30:49,770
Understood.

574
00:30:49,804 --> 00:30:51,364
I will inform the General.

575
00:30:51,408 --> 00:30:53,275
Engineer, you have the Bridge.

576
00:31:03,467 --> 00:31:05,938
I want to thank you
for what you did

577
00:31:05,973 --> 00:31:07,442
in the mess hall.

578
00:31:07,476 --> 00:31:09,469
Is Ortakin your <i>parmach'kai?</i>

579
00:31:11,485 --> 00:31:14,515
Things are coming
to a head on this ship.

580
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,794
When the fighting breaks
out, stay with me.

581
00:31:17,833 --> 00:31:19,632
I'll protect you.

582
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:23,075
I was still hoping there wasn't
going to be any fighting.

583
00:31:35,705 --> 00:31:37,038
Station.

584
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:41,973
Station!

585
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:59,483
Something is wrong here, Worf.

586
00:31:59,524 --> 00:32:00,993
I can feel it.

587
00:32:01,027 --> 00:32:03,294
If the <i>B'Moth</i> was attacked
by the Jem'Hadar

588
00:32:03,332 --> 00:32:05,063
why would there be survivors?

589
00:32:05,103 --> 00:32:07,438
Since we do not know
any details of the battles

590
00:32:07,475 --> 00:32:08,699
it is difficult to speculate.

591
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:11,897
We both know the Jem'Hadar do
not leave a task half-finished.

592
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:15,175
If they left the ship intact
and part of the crew still alive

593
00:32:15,213 --> 00:32:16,773
they did it for a reason.

594
00:32:16,817 --> 00:32:18,480
There could be
many explanations.

595
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:20,719
The <i>B'Moth</i> could have
inflicted heavy damage

596
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:23,253
on the Jem'Hadar ships,
forcing them to withdraw.

597
00:32:23,298 --> 00:32:24,892
The Jem'Hadar could
have been recalled...

598
00:32:24,935 --> 00:32:27,099
How is it
that I have only one eye

599
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:30,010
but I can see more clearly
than anyone around me?

600
00:32:30,046 --> 00:32:32,779
They deliberately left survivors
on that ship.

601
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,289
Why?

602
00:32:34,322 --> 00:32:37,352
Because they want someone
to try to rescue them.

603
00:32:37,396 --> 00:32:41,360
Oh, do not take this personally,
my friend.

604
00:32:41,405 --> 00:32:43,398
I spent two years
with the Jem'Hadar.

605
00:32:43,442 --> 00:32:47,383
I do not expect you to have
the same insight into them

606
00:32:47,418 --> 00:32:50,151
that I do.

607
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:53,493
They're soulless creatures,
Worf.

608
00:32:53,531 --> 00:32:58,907
Fighting for no goal, no purpose
except to serve the Founders.

609
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:01,574
They take no pleasure
in what they do.

610
00:33:01,649 --> 00:33:04,519
Nothing is glorified,
nothing affirmed.

611
00:33:04,556 --> 00:33:06,185
To the Jem'Hadar

612
00:33:06,226 --> 00:33:09,130
we are nothing more than...
than targets to be destroyed.

613
00:33:09,165 --> 00:33:11,568
I must not let them
destroy us, Worf...

614
00:33:11,604 --> 00:33:13,471
With all due respect, General

615
00:33:13,508 --> 00:33:17,415
we do not know the tactical
situation of the <i>B'Moth</i> yet.

616
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:21,391
We should guard against making
any premature judgments.

617
00:33:23,263 --> 00:33:24,926
Of course.

618
00:33:36,292 --> 00:33:37,784
Dismissed.

619
00:33:49,621 --> 00:33:51,181
<i>Rotarran</i> Combat Log

620
00:33:51,225 --> 00:33:54,960
the 53rd day in the year
of Kahless 999.

621
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,833
We have reached
the Cardassian border

622
00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:00,002
and begun our search
for the <i>B'Moth.</i>

623
00:34:00,044 --> 00:34:02,811
Helm... keep us at least

624
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:05,344
five million <i>kellicams</i>
from the border.

625
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:06,654
Understood.

626
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:08,353
I think I've got something.

627
00:34:08,396 --> 00:34:10,492
It's hard to make out
through all the interference

628
00:34:10,534 --> 00:34:12,470
but the thermal signature
looks like a ship.

629
00:34:12,505 --> 00:34:14,840
It's bearing direct
to starboard

630
00:34:14,877 --> 00:34:17,474
at an elevation of 25 degrees.

631
00:34:17,516 --> 00:34:19,008
It's coming into visual range.

632
00:34:19,053 --> 00:34:20,784
On screen.

633
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:32,677
The <i>B'Moth.</i>

634
00:34:32,715 --> 00:34:33,979
Confirmed.

635
00:34:34,019 --> 00:34:36,513
Helm, lay in a course
to bring us alongside.

636
00:34:36,558 --> 00:34:39,257
Bridge to Medical Ward.
Prepare to receive casualties.

637
00:34:39,297 --> 00:34:41,199
Assemble an armed boarding party
in Transporter Room 1.

638
00:34:41,234 --> 00:34:43,728
Make a complete search
of all the habitable areas...

639
00:34:43,807 --> 00:34:44,934
Hold.

640
00:34:44,976 --> 00:34:46,445
Commander Dax

641
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,849
what side of the border
are they on?

642
00:34:48,885 --> 00:34:52,758
They're 500,000 <i>kellicams</i> inside
Cardassian territory, sir.

643
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,559
They must have drifted across
a couple of days ago.

644
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,507
There are probably
five Jem'Hadar warships

645
00:34:59,541 --> 00:35:01,340
out there right now

646
00:35:01,379 --> 00:35:03,873
just waiting for us
to cross the border.

647
00:35:03,918 --> 00:35:06,891
General, if they are nearby

648
00:35:06,924 --> 00:35:09,521
they do not care what side
of the border we are on.

649
00:35:09,563 --> 00:35:10,964
They will simply attack.

650
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,993
I have explicit orders
from the High Council

651
00:35:13,038 --> 00:35:14,735
not to enter
Cardassian territory.

652
00:35:14,775 --> 00:35:16,142
I am certain the High Council

653
00:35:16,178 --> 00:35:18,171
will not object
under these circumstances.

654
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:19,947
There are still survivors
aboard the B'Moth.

655
00:35:19,986 --> 00:35:21,580
We do not know that.

656
00:35:21,623 --> 00:35:24,094
All that we know is there is
an automated distress call.

657
00:35:24,129 --> 00:35:25,496
They could all be dead by now.

658
00:35:25,532 --> 00:35:27,502
And if they are not?

659
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:32,472
Then there is nothing
we can do for them.

660
00:35:32,514 --> 00:35:37,150
General, you don't intend
to just leave them there?

661
00:35:37,191 --> 00:35:39,958
I will not throw away
the lives of this crew

662
00:35:39,997 --> 00:35:42,468
in a futile rescue attempt.

663
00:35:42,502 --> 00:35:43,801
They are Klingon warriors.

664
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:44,807
We just cannot sit...

665
00:35:44,874 --> 00:35:46,366
I have made my decision!

666
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:49,042
We will not cross the border!

667
00:35:51,689 --> 00:35:56,359
From this moment, anyone
who questions that... - anyone...

668
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,567
will be charged
with treasonable disobedience.

669
00:36:02,012 --> 00:36:04,005
Worf...

670
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:06,248
you have the Bridge.

671
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:21,714
Stations!

672
00:36:26,633 --> 00:36:28,626
Stations!

673
00:36:33,314 --> 00:36:35,547
We can't just leave those
men out there to die.

674
00:36:35,586 --> 00:36:37,078
No.

675
00:36:37,122 --> 00:36:38,853
So what are you going to do?

676
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,623
The only thing I can do...

677
00:36:40,664 --> 00:36:43,534
challenge Martok
for command of the ship.

678
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:45,563
I agree.

679
00:36:45,608 --> 00:36:49,013
But you realize, he may
not step aside willingly.

680
00:36:49,049 --> 00:36:50,746
I know.

681
00:36:50,786 --> 00:36:53,553
But if the General
will not step aside...

682
00:36:55,897 --> 00:36:57,958
I will have to kill him.

683
00:37:29,571 --> 00:37:32,703
Martok must die.

684
00:37:32,744 --> 00:37:34,714
That is not your decision.

685
00:37:34,748 --> 00:37:36,912
He is a coward.

686
00:37:36,987 --> 00:37:41,053
While he commands,
he dishonors us all.

687
00:37:41,096 --> 00:37:44,831
I shed no tears
for your dishonor, Leskit.

688
00:37:44,872 --> 00:37:49,405
Today would be a bad day to die

689
00:37:49,448 --> 00:37:51,077
son of Mogh.

690
00:37:51,118 --> 00:37:54,387
Take your Trill and go.

691
00:38:00,773 --> 00:38:02,367
Unlikely.

692
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:07,012
I was hoping you would say
something like that.

693
00:38:15,305 --> 00:38:17,138
Alert Status One.

694
00:38:17,175 --> 00:38:19,669
All hands to battle stations.

695
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,618
We are going to rescue
the survivors of the <i>B'Moth.</i>

696
00:38:26,863 --> 00:38:29,630
Who gave the order?

697
00:38:29,669 --> 00:38:31,639
What's going on here?

698
00:38:31,674 --> 00:38:32,835
As First Officer

699
00:38:32,876 --> 00:38:35,279
I say that you are unfit
to serve as Captain.

700
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:37,182
You what?

701
00:38:37,219 --> 00:38:39,986
You are a coward

702
00:38:40,059 --> 00:38:42,530
and I challenge you
for command of this ship.

703
00:38:42,565 --> 00:38:46,836
I never would have expected
this from you, Worf.

704
00:39:54,823 --> 00:40:00,427
Martok, Martok,
Martok, Martok...

705
00:40:02,195 --> 00:40:05,966
Tactical alert!
Tactical alert!

706
00:40:06,004 --> 00:40:09,705
There is a Jem'Hadar warship
bearing 180 mark 215.

707
00:40:09,745 --> 00:40:13,150
They will be within weapons
range in nine minutes.

708
00:40:14,623 --> 00:40:19,225
The Jem'Hadar will soon learn
to regret this day.

709
00:40:19,267 --> 00:40:21,237
Who is with me?!

710
00:40:21,271 --> 00:40:22,330
Tavana!

711
00:40:22,373 --> 00:40:26,508
Sometimes... I think
I know why I love you.

712
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,314
Let's go to the Medical Ward.

713
00:40:28,353 --> 00:40:29,480

714
00:40:29,522 --> 00:40:30,490
Wait.

715
00:40:30,524 --> 00:40:32,825

737

How's the intelligence
business?

738
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,554
Oh, I can't talk about it.

739
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:32,354
All I can do is read
these fascinating reports

740
00:41:32,393 --> 00:41:34,090
and analyses,
and analyses of analyses

741
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:35,463
and then
keep it all to myself

742
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,767
because no one else
has "a need to know."

743
00:41:37,806 --> 00:41:39,070
So I have to walk
around this station

744
00:41:39,108 --> 00:41:40,668
feeling like I, uh...

745
00:41:40,712 --> 00:41:42,045
You don't really care,
do you?

746
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:43,311
No.

747
00:41:44,887 --> 00:41:47,757
A vessel's de-cloaking 15
kilometers off the station.

748
00:41:47,794 --> 00:41:49,161
It's the <i>Rotarran.</i>

749
00:41:49,197 --> 00:41:50,426
Martok's ship.

750
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:52,164
Yes, sir, and there's
an incoming transmission.

751
00:41:52,204 --> 00:41:54,368
On screen.

752
00:41:54,409 --> 00:41:56,379
Major, we've rescued
35 survivors

753
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:58,509
of a disabled
Klingon battle cruiser.

754
00:41:58,551 --> 00:42:01,615
Request permission to beam them
directly to your Infirmary.

755
00:42:01,657 --> 00:42:03,422
Permission granted, General.

756
00:42:03,462 --> 00:42:05,364
You're also cleared
to dock at Bay 4.

757
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,199
We'll need an engineering team

758
00:42:07,237 --> 00:42:10,699
to repair our battle damage,
and one other thing.

759
00:42:10,744 --> 00:42:12,908
Arrange to have
15 barrels of bloodwine

760
00:42:13,016 --> 00:42:14,451
waiting for us at the airlock

761
00:42:14,486 --> 00:42:17,789
so that we can celebrate
the first victory

762
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:21,768
of the <i>Rotarran</i>
over the Jem'Hadar!

763
00:42:34,129 --> 00:42:35,723
Worf.

764
00:42:35,766 --> 00:42:37,133
General.

765
00:42:37,169 --> 00:42:40,472
The High Council
has issued a commendation

766
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:43,311
for the entire crew
of the <i>Rotarran.</i>

767
00:42:43,349 --> 00:42:45,980
It would seem
that you were right.

768
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:48,493
They view the destruction
of a Jem'Hadar ship

769
00:42:48,528 --> 00:42:52,229
and the rescue of 35 warriors
as ample justification

770
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:53,966
for crossing
the Cardassian border.

771
00:42:54,006 --> 00:42:58,380
Your... actions
on the <i>Rotarran...</i>

772
00:42:58,415 --> 00:43:00,648
at the time,
I thought they were disloyal

773
00:43:00,687 --> 00:43:03,158
but I have come to realize

774
00:43:03,193 --> 00:43:05,664
that your intention
was to remind me of my duty

775
00:43:05,698 --> 00:43:08,101
as a soldier of the Empire
and as a warrior.

776
00:43:08,137 --> 00:43:09,436
For that, I am grateful.

777
00:43:09,474 --> 00:43:11,273
You did the same for me once.

778
00:43:11,311 --> 00:43:12,837
Worf...

779
00:43:14,418 --> 00:43:18,985
on the Bridge, during the fight
when you dropped your guard

780
00:43:19,061 --> 00:43:22,034
how did you know
I would not kill you?

781
00:43:26,678 --> 00:43:28,272
I did not know.

782
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:33,425
I see you're still wearing

783
00:43:33,459 --> 00:43:35,156
the crest
of the House of Mogh.

784
00:43:38,303 --> 00:43:39,829
Yes.

785
00:43:39,873 --> 00:43:43,678
Jadzia calls it
a... sentimental gesture.

786
00:43:43,716 --> 00:43:44,980
Ah.

787
00:43:45,018 --> 00:43:49,620
Perhaps you would consider
replacing sentiment with...

788
00:43:49,662 --> 00:43:52,635
the symbol of a new beginning.

789
00:43:55,408 --> 00:44:00,818
The House of Martok
would be honored

790
00:44:00,853 --> 00:44:03,849
to welcome the son of Mogh
into our family

791
00:44:03,893 --> 00:44:06,660
as a warrior...

792
00:44:06,699 --> 00:44:07,921
and as a brother.

793
00:44:25,126 --> 00:44:27,119
