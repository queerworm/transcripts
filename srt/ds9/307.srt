1
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,765
How's it going, Jake?

2
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:17,852
Fine. I've deleted
half the Cardassian files
from the computer.

3
00:00:17,852 --> 00:00:19,895
I can't believe how many
subroutines it took

4
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:21,939
just to run
this ore processor.

5
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:24,817
Well, it used to be
a pretty large operation.

6
00:00:24,817 --> 00:00:26,694
When the Cardassians
were in charge

7
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:29,237
I understand they processed
20,000 tons a day.

8
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:30,656
That's a lot of ore.

9
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:32,616
It must've been
hell in here.

10
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:34,159
I heard stories

11
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,787
the temperature
reached 55 degrees Celsius.

12
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:38,664
How could the Bajoran
workers survive that?

13
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:41,082
Oh, a lot of them didn't.

14
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,378
When you've deleted
all those files,

15
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,797
I'll show you how to download
the new operating system.

16
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:48,924
You really think
we can convert this place

17
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:50,551
into a deuterium refinery?

18
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,012
Absolutely.
It'll take
us three...

19
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:54,555
maybe four
weeks at most.

20
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,891
I hope you're
planning on eating

21
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:59,393
during the next
three or four weeks.

22
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:02,688
Commander, I guess
I lost track
of the time.

23
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:04,773
JAKE:
We're almost
finished, Dad.

24
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:07,568
Chief, I'm having a problem
deleting one of these files.

25
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:10,654
Have you tried reformatting
the data cluster?

26
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:12,948
Yeah, but the file's
still here.

27
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:14,408
Here, let me see.

28
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,661
Well, that's odd.

29
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,872
What's that, Chief?

30
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:22,708
Well, the file has no name,
no indication what it is.

31
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:25,293
I better set it
aside for now.

32
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,212
I can transfer it to the
central database in Ops,

33
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,547
and analyze it
in the morning.

34
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:32,426
(<i> console beeping</i> )
Wait a minute.

35
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,386
COMPUTER:
Unauthorized computer entry

36
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:37,431
detected
in Ore Processing Unit 5.

37
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:38,807
Enter access code.

38
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,477
(<i> keyboard beeping</i> )
Incorrect code.

39
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:45,689
You have five seconds
to enter correct access code.

40
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,190
Or what?

41
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,569
I don't know,
but I better stop it.

42
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,280
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

43
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:57,743
COMPUTER:
Warning.

44
00:01:57,743 --> 00:02:01,288
Worker revolt in progress
in Ore Processing Unit 5.

45
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,665
Security countermeasures
initiated.

46
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,668
What the hell?

47
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:10,338
Bajoran workers,
your attention, please.

48
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:13,174
Your attempt to seize
control of this facility

49
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,843
is going to fail.

50
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,972
You are valuable workers,
and we wish you no harm.

51
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:20,975
However, if you do not
return control of this unit

52
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:22,851
to your Cardassian
supervisors,

53
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,937
we will be forced
to take action.

54
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:28,523
You have eight minutes
to make your decision.

55
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,606
The computer's engaged
the magnetic seal.

56
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:33,982
I can't override it.

57
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,067
KIRA:
Ops to Sisko.

58
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,443
Go ahead.

59
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,319
Commander, what is
going on down there?

60
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,406
We just got a recorded message
from Gul Dukat

61
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,242
regarding some worker revolt
in the ore processing facility?

62
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:45,869
We saw the same message.

63
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,871
It seems we've tripped

64
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:50,624
some kind of automated security
program the Cardassians left.

65
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,084
We're locked in.

66
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:54,169
Oh, we'll beam you
out of there.

67
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,130
COMPUTER:
Enter access code.

68
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,423
What?

69
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,759
If this security program
thinks there's been

70
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,552
some kind of worker's revolt,
then it must think

71
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,429
this station is still
under Cardassian rule.

72
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,640
So it's probably waiting for us
to enter an emergency code.

73
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,268
One that the Cardassians
never bothered to give us

74
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:10,351
when they left.

75
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,854
Odo to Ops.
Kira here.

76
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,440
My Cardassian access codes
are still valid.

77
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,443
I'm attempting to override
the security program,

78
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,028
but it's going
to take some time.

79
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,239
I'm not sure my clearance level
is high enough.

80
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,032
KIRA:
Well, keep at it.

81
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,533
We'll try to do the same thing
from up here.

82
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,702
Acknowledged.

83
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,746
Odo, do you
mind telling me

84
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,623
what this is all about?

85
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:34,209
That message from
Dukat is making my
customers nervous.

86
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,919
And when they're nervous,
they're not...

87
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:36,878
Not now, Quark.

88
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,964
I'm busy.

89
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,924
Well, is there anything
I can do to help?

90
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,383
Not unless you have

91
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:45,179
a level 9 Cardassian
security clearance.

92
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:46,972
Let's see.

93
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:50,017
I think I have everything
from levels 1 through 7.

94
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:53,520
I only have
levels 1 through 6.

95
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,522
Well.
If you'd like a level 7

96
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:58,317
I'm sure we can make
some kind of arrangement.

97
00:05:58,317 --> 00:05:59,526
Leave me alone, Quark.

98
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,987
Oh, no.

99
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,531
There's something
very wrong going on,

100
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:07,826
and this is the safest place
in the whole station.

101
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:11,288
I think I'll stay right here.

102
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,332
Any luck?

103
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:15,000
Nothing.

104
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,544
It's probably magnetically
sealed, like the door.

105
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:20,255
We'd need a phaser
to blast it open.

106
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:22,007
Well, there's no way

107
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,592
I can disable
the program from here.

108
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,553
DUKAT:
Bajoran workers,

109
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,348
your time is running out,
but it's not too late.

110
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:32,517
You can still surrender
and save your lives.

111
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:43,028
Computer, this is the leader
of the Bajoran workers.

112
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,654
We surrender.

113
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:48,825
DUKAT:
I'm glad to see

114
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,869
you've come to your senses.

115
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,871
Stay where you are.

116
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,539
When Cardassian Security
arrives,

117
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,750
they will place you
into custody,

118
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,752
but you will not be harmed.

119
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,004
You have my word.

120
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,964
For whatever that's worth.

121
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,007
Now what?

122
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,093
SISKO:
Well, it sounds like

123
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:09,596
the program is going to wait
for Cardassian security

124
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,472
to enter the
all-clear protocol.

125
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,808
That'll give us
a few minutes anyway.

126
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:19,856
What's in here?

127
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,482
Nothing at
the moment.

128
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,985
Processed uridium used
to pour down that pipe

129
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,862
to a secondary
refining facility

130
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,115
in Level 33
and be purified.

131
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,201
It's not locked.

132
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,287
Since that pipe was filled
with molten uridium,

133
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:35,080
there wasn't any need
for security measures.

134
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,582
Well, it's too narrow
for anyone to escape through.

135
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,043
I can get in there.

136
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,963
Chief, if he can crawl
up this pipe into the machine,

137
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,672
can he get
to the ore chute

138
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:47,050
and open that hatch
from inside?

139
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,930
DUKAT:
Bajoran workers,
you have not surrendered

140
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,348
to Cardassian security.

141
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,893
If you do not do so
in the next three minutes,

142
00:07:56,893 --> 00:08:00,105
I will be forced
to release neurocine gas

143
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:03,108
into the ore processing
facility.

144
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:05,068
I can do it.

145
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,204
DUKAT:
Bajoran workers,

146
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:20,375
you have two minutes left
to give yourselves up

147
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,962
to your Cardassian overseers
and save your lives.

148
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,588
Can you hear me, Jake?

149
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,966
JAKE:
Loud and clear,
but I can't see a thing.

150
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:30,969
There should be a large circular
opening to your right.

151
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:33,221
JAKE:
Okay, let me see
if I can find it.

152
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,098
DUKAT:
Even if you were

153
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:37,267
to escape this station...

154
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,185
(<i> metallic thud</i> )

155
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:39,269
JAKE:
Ow!

156
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,021
SISKO:
Jake-o, you all right?

157
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,648
JAKE:
Yeah, I just banged
my head on something.

158
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,233
DUKAT:
...back to Bajor?

159
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,401
JAKE:
Wait a second.

160
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:47,819
There's a junction here.

161
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,571
It feels like it goes
off in two directions.

162
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,907
Which way do I go?

163
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,617
Follow this
sound, Jake.

164
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,827
(<i> banging</i> )

165
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:58,621
JAKE:
Do it again, Dad.

166
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,499
(<i> banging</i> )

167
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:01,666
JAKE:
Got it.

168
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,126
I'm in the chute.

169
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,962
There should be
a small access port

170
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,714
on one of the walls.

171
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,341
JAKE:
Found it.

172
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:12,927
Open the hatch
and feel around inside
for a handle.

173
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,305
It should be shaped
like a stirrup.

174
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,598
(<i> Dukat continues speaking</i> )

175
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,101
You know, I never knew
how much this man's
voice annoyed me.

176
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:24,147
JAKE:
I can reach it,
but I can't get a hold of it.

177
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,358
You have to pull
the handle down, Jake.

178
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,693
It's the release
for the hatch.

179
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,945
JAKE:
I'm trying! I can't...

180
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,322
SISKO:
Don't tense up.

181
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:33,656
Relax.

182
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:37,035
Now just take a deep
breath and try again.

183
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:40,872
I'm sorry,
but your time has run out.

184
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:44,418
I was hoping
you would be reasonable.

185
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:49,130
Rest assured that your deaths
will serve as an example

186
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:53,343
to prevent similar
incidents in the future.

187
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:57,055
I got it!

188
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,651
Dax!

189
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:15,407
Maybe if we bypass
the primary command pathway

190
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:17,576
and cross-connect
the backup with the ODN.

191
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:22,789
COMPUTER:
Warning. Workers have escaped
from Ore Processing Unit 5.

192
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,749
Initiating station-wide

193
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,626
(<i> alarm blares</i> )

194
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,381
Now what?

195
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:36,052
DUKAT:
Attention, Bajoran workers.

196
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,055
I will not allow
this rebellion to succeed.

197
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,933
If you do not
surrender immediately,

198
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:46,271
I will be forced to kill
every Bajoran on this station.

199
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:01,244
(<i> grunting and scuffling</i> )

200
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,709
Wait a second.
I found something.

201
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,253
SISKO:
What is it?

202
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:13,089
I don't know.
Some kind of room.

203
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,216
It sure is dirty.

204
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:18,637
Doesn't smell too good either.

205
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:23,391
SISKO:
Looks like some
kind of loading bay.

206
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,896
You're right.

207
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,898
This is where
the uridium ore

208
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,567
was separated
from the rock.

209
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,194
Then it would be
dumped down that chute

210
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,737
to the processing
facility.

211
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,367
(<i> banging</i> )

212
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,618
Locked.

213
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,953
Chief, is there
another way out of here?

214
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,580
Just back down
that chute.

215
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,291
You know where
that leads to.

216
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:51,710
Sisko to Ops.

217
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,087
Sisko to Security.

218
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,215
Try yours.

219
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,175
O'Brien to Ops.

220
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,594
Jake Sisko to anyone
who can hear me.

221
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:02,556
Something must
be interfering
with the signal.

222
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:09,396
What do we do now?

223
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,064
It's no good.

224
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,731
We're completely cut off
from the rest of the station.

225
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,234
BASHIR:
There must be some kind

226
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,943
of general dampening field
in place.

227
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,987
It must be disrupting
communications.

228
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,322
All right.

229
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,284
It's time for a less
subtle approach.

230
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,415
Doctor.

231
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:42,429
Ah, the Cardassians don't
miss a trick, do they?

232
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,138
DAX:
The ironic thing is

233
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,224
that field is probably there
to protect Ops

234
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,934
from the hordes
of rebelling Bajorans.

235
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,810
KIRA:
Well, we've got
to find a way

236
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,438
of disabling
the security program

237
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,772
or a lot of people
are going to get killed.

238
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:56,317
If we can regain
control of the main computer,

239
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:59,237
we may be able to wipe
the security program

240
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:00,821
from its memory.

241
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:03,742
Now, if I can reroute
the APT relay

242
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:05,535
through the secondary buffer,

243
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:08,204
I might get an independent
terminal working.

244
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,498
You know, I've been here
nearly three years,

245
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,626
and I was just finally
starting to think

246
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,377
of this place as home.

247
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:17,046
Your "home" was built
by Cardassians, Doctor.

248
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,757
Don't ever forget that.

249
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:21,426
Well, there's not much chance
of that, is there?

250
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:24,387
What do you mean,
we're trapped?

251
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:27,140
I mean, we're trapped.

252
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,767
I wouldn't be surprised

253
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,977
if the entire station
is locked down.

254
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,104
QUARK:
But you're
a shape-shifter.

255
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:36,190
Excuse me, a changeling.

256
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,901
So change into something
and get us out of here.

257
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:42,280
This force field isn't
just protecting the door.

258
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,032
It goes through the bulkheads,
the ceiling, the deck.

259
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,660
There's nowhere
for me to go.

260
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,745
You're telling me
I'm stuck here...

261
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,622
with you?

262
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:51,956
No...

263
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,917
I'm stuck here with<i> you.</i>

264
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,253
Believe me, a far worse fate.

265
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,048
(<i> keyboard beeping</i> )

266
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:04,135
And stay away from my computer!

267
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:08,807
(<i> grunting</i> )

268
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,689
Again!

269
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:19,275
Oh, okay. Hold on.

270
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,781
JAKE:
Anything?

271
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:27,575
Not even a dent.

272
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,620
There has to be something
else we can do.

273
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,541
What about
all this ore?

274
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:39,420
As I understand it,
uridium is very unstable.

275
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,881
That's true,
but in its raw form,

276
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,342
you need a strong electrical
charge to detonate it.

277
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,469
Can we use that?

278
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,929
Well, if I had some tools,
I might be able to get in there

279
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,057
and yank out
some electrical cable.

280
00:14:58,690 --> 00:14:59,982
Tools.

281
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,872
How's it coming?
DAX:
Almost done.

282
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,331
(<i> electrical hissing,</i>
<i>Dax yells</i> )

283
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,875
Jadzia!

284
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,002
Get me a medkit.

285
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,462
Easy, Jadzia.

286
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,464
I have to take a look.

287
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:27,009
I was reaching toward
the ODN conduit,

288
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,803
and a small force
field went off,

289
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,096
and it caught my hands.

290
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,273
Well, they're
second-degree burns,

291
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,066
but I don't think
there's any neural damage.

292
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,320
This should
relieve the pain.

293
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,031
COMPUTER:

DUKAT:
Attention, Bajoran workers.

297
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,372
Your failure to surrender

298
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:59,584
is forcing me
to take stronger measures.

299
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:03,797
In five minutes, we will
begin pumping neurocine gas

300
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,799
into the Habitat Ring.

301
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,216
Think of your families

302
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:10,261
as you consider
your course of action.

303
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:15,391
All Cardassian personnel should
evacuate the area immediately.

304
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,771
Habitat Ring. There have
to be hundreds of people

305
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:21,272
trapped in their quarters
out there.

306
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:22,941
GARAK:
I believe that's
the point, Major.

307
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:27,904
Computer,
access code: Garak 1359.

308
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:34,410
Ironic, isn't it?
The only place

309
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,996
in the galaxy that still
recognizes my access code

310
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,581
is a Bajoran
space station.

311
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,541
If you can get past
the force fields,

312
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,376
you've got to get out
to the Habitat Ring

313
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,462
and start evacuating
those people before...

314
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:46,506
I'd like nothing better
than to help my loyal customers,

315
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,633
but it's not that simple.

316
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:52,303
My access code enables me
to move about the station,

317
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:54,597
but unfortunately,
as you've just seen,

318
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,265
the force fields reappear

319
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,100
the moment I pass
through a doorway.

320
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,602
Have you tried
using your code

321
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,729
to shut down the
security program?

322
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:05,232
Several times, but for some
reason I can't begin to fathom,

323
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:07,777
Gul Dukat
chose not to trust me

324
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:11,572
with his top-level security
codes during the occupation.

325
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:15,910
Garak, do you know a way
we can stop this neurocine gas?

326
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,370
The only way
to do that

327
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,246
is to destroy
the life support system.

328
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,290
What are you trying to do,
Garak, get us all killed?

329
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,543
No, wait a minute.
He's right.

330
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,420
The neurocine gas
is released through
the life support systems.

331
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,340
Destroy it and we save everybody
in the Habitat Ring.

332
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,967
For 12 hours,

333
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,760
and then everyone
on the station

334
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,804
will suffocate when
we run out of oxygen.

335
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,681
Well, that gives us 12 hours

336
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,516
to regain control
of this station.

337
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,393
Believe me, Major,

338
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:44,480
it's the only way
to save those people.

339
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,775
I believe life support is
controlled from over there.

340
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,990
Get down.

My fellow Cardassians,

00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:17,013
I regret to inform you
that Bajoran workers

346
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,057
have gained control
of this station.

347
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:24,478
In all likelihood, I am dead
or otherwise incapacitated.

348
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,439
But rest assured,

349
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:30,568
this station will not be allowed
to remain in Bajoran hands.

350
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:34,321
However, it is
my duty to inform you

351
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:37,617
that if you do not regain
control within two hours,

352
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:41,871
the station will be destroyed.

353
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:44,791
COMPUTER:
Self-destruct sequence
initiated.

354
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,343
Come on.

355
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,014
Come on!

356
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:03,476
Give me that before
you hurt yourself.

357
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,144
(<i> sighs</i> )

358
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,355
I've checked the entire
security complex.

359
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,941
There's no way out.

360
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:12,110
I should've listened
to my father.

361
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,862
He always warned me
this was going to happen.

362
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:18,198
What? That you'd spend
your final hours in jail?

363
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,826
I could've told you that.

364
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,036
<i>No.</i>

365
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:25,247
He warned me
never to leave home.

366
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,708
He said there were plenty
of business opportunities

367
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,376
right outside my door.

368
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,588
But, no, I had to follow
the 75th Rule of Acquisition:

369
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:37,010
"Home is where the heart is, but
the stars are made of latinum."

370
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:44,684
A lifetime of scheming
and plotting,

371
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,811
wheeling and dealing,

372
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:47,937
and what has it got me?

373
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:50,564
One measly little bar.

374
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:53,067
My Uncle Frin owns 30.

375
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,777
And my Cousin Gaila...

376
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:57,571
I know-- he
owns a<i> moon.</i>

377
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,448
I told you that?

378
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,283
Many times.

379
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:04,578
It's a small moon,
but it's enough to live on.

380
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:05,955
Oh, come on, Quark.

381
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:08,124
You've done all
right for yourself.

382
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,876
Oh, what do you know?

383
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:13,587
Quark, I've met a lot
of Ferengis in my time,

384
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,381
and the truth is,

385
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:19,468
though some of them may
have been more wealthy,

386
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,346
I've never met
one more devious.

387
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,973
Really?

388
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:25,516
Would I lie?

389
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:27,101
I guess not.

390
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,730
Thank you, Odo.

391
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,066
That means a lot to me.

392
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,777
Now...

393
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,697
can I have the phaser back?

394
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,532
No.

395
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:42,825
(<i> angry yell</i> )

396
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,493
(<i> frustrated sigh</i> )

397
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,953
How do your hands feel?

398
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,246
A little better.

399
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,415
Good. I wish I could
have done more,

400
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:52,501
but I won't be able to
repair the damaged tissue

401
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,712
until we can get you
to the Infirmary.

402
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:55,755
Any luck?

403
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:56,797
Plenty, Major.

404
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,925
Unfortunately,
all of it bad.

405
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:02,053
My personal code can
activate any terminal
on this station.

406
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:04,597
However, that's the
extent of my access.

407
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,473
All I can do is
just look around.

408
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:09,643
I can tell you exactly
what's going on,

409
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:12,063
but I can't do
anything about it.

410
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,941
As far as I can see,
the only person

411
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:18,611
who can disable the security
program is Gul Dukat.

412
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,529
Maybe there's a way
to fool the computer

413
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,865
into thinking
that you are Gul Dukat.

414
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:25,910
You could try rewriting
your code to match his.

415
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,204
Even if I could,
it wouldn't do any good.

416
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:29,872
If I were to input his code,

417
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:32,416
the computer would scan
my DNA pattern

418
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,501
to determine
if I really were Dukat.

419
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,129
DAX:
But what if
we disable

420
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:37,671
the sensors in Ops

421
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,548
so that the computer
couldn't scan you?

422
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,218
What a creative idea.

423
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:45,679
It certainly is
worth a try.

424
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,099
The question is,
can we disconnect the sensors

425
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:50,143
without anyone else
getting hurt?

426
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:51,894
We're just going
to have to take that chance.

427
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:53,980
DAX:
We could switch

428
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,357
the sensor input
from the primary scanners
to the backup scanners.

429
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:59,902
The computer
shouldn't see that
as a threat

430
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,862
but it'll blind
the system for a few seconds

431
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,656
while we make the changeover.

432
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:07,034
If it works, a few seconds
are all I'll need.

433
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,829
Major, I'm going to need a hand.

434
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:19,005
Well, tell me, Doctor,
what is it exactly

435
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,257
about this situation
that's making you smile?

436
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:22,300
You, Garak.

437
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,509
Hmm?

438
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,511
Just wondering how
many other tailors

439
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:28,514
can rewrite Cardassian
security protocols.

440
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,183
I wouldn't even
venture a guess.

441
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:31,517
Which reminds me,

442
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,519
those pants
you wanted altered

443
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,146
are ready to be picked up.

444
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:36,354
Oh, this is a problem.

445
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:38,107
What's wrong?

446
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,151
I always suspected that Dukat
was a little paranoid.

447
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:43,696
He's left a rather large number
of interrogative subroutines

448
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,614
imbedded in his access code.

449
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,407
Meaning what?

450
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:50,286
Meaning the computer is
constantly challenging me

451
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:53,998
to prove that I am
who I say I am.
Lieutenant,

452
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:57,126
how much longer before you can
disable those sensors?

453
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:58,752
Oh, at least
another ten minutes.

454
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,504
I'm not sure
we have that much time.

455
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,589
In fact,
I'm sure we don't.

456
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:05,343
COMPUTER:
Warning. Unauthorized use

457
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:06,969
of command code.

458
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:09,638
Initiating counterinsurgency
program level four.

459
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,481
(<i> groaning</i> )

460
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,067
On three.

461
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:22,902
One, two,

462
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:25,196
three.

463
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:26,322
You did it.

464
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:28,741
Okay, we have
the power cable.

465
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,243
Now, we need to pack
the uridium

466
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:31,869
around the door.

467
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:44,965
My phaser's on the Ops table!
Can anyone get to it?

468
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,931
The answer, Major, is no.

469
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,808
Well, we can't stay here
and do nothing.

470
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:57,728
I respectfully disagree, Major.
Nothing is about all we can do.

471
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:03,234
Let me guess.

472
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:05,361
Someone tried
to duplicate

473
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:06,820
my access code, hmm?

474
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,030
Dukat!

475
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,783
What the hell are
you doing here?!

476
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:14,661
A short time ago, I had
a very strange experience.

477
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:18,249
There I was, patrolling
the Demilitarized Zone

478
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:21,710
when I received
a distress signal... from me,

479
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,422
or at least
a recording of me.

480
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:29,635
It seems the Bajoran workers
were rioting on Terok Nor.

481
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,678
(<i> laughs</i> )

482
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:35,141
I must admit,
it piqued my curiosity.

483
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,439
I see.

484
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:44,275
The autodestruct program
has begun.

485
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:46,360
Well, well,
well...

486
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,570
you are in trouble.

487
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,781
Where's Commander Sisko?

488
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:52,950
I trust he wasn't vaporized

489
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:57,495
while asking for one of those
<i>raktajinos</i> he's so fond of.

490
00:24:57,495 --> 00:24:58,956
No, last we heard,

491
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:01,208
he was trapped
in the ore processing unit.

492
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,960
Hmm.

493
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,254
I wish him well.

494
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:07,131
Well, can you help us or not?

495
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:09,133
Oh, most certainly.

496
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:12,928
All I have to do is
enter my command code

497
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,431
and shut down the program.

498
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:16,723
Well, then do it!

499
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:19,517
All in good time, Major Kira.

500
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:21,270
All in good time.

501
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:27,360
But, first, there are a few
things we should discuss.

502
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,404
Red leaf tea, please.

503
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:39,830
Doctor.

504
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,625
What do you want, Dukat?

505
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:50,007
You'll find I don't react well
to that tone of voice, Major.

506
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:54,178
(<i> laughs</i> )

507
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:57,931
Garak, groveling
in a corner.

508
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,684
That alone makes
my trip worthwhile.

509
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:04,021
Garak!
Easy, Doctor.

510
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:05,772
It would appear

511
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:09,485
that the computer is
only targeting non-Cardassians.

512
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:13,072
If you had been on the station
when I designed this program,

513
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:15,032
I would have made an exception
in your case.

514
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:18,077
Well, you've always
been shortsighted.

515
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:20,746
It's held you back
over the years.

516
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:23,790
As I recall, your father
had the same flaw.

517
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:28,254
My father's only flaw
was trusting you.

518
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:29,587
Funny, at his trial,

519
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:32,425
your father said
that his biggest flaw was

520
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:35,386
that his ambition outweighed
his patriotism.

521
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:39,056
Maybe you two could settle
this at another time!

522
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:40,682
You're right, Major.

523
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:45,645
But believe me, Garak,
that time is coming.

524
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,398
Major!

525
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:50,817
Why don't you join me
in the Commander's office

526
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:53,153
where we can talk in private?

527
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:59,868
Oh! I forgot.
The replicator.

528
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:06,125
Well, it's the least I can do.

529
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,215
You can all rise now.

530
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:15,968
You're safe.

531
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:18,554
For the moment.

532
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,981
Major.

533
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:39,825
(<i> sighs</i> )

534
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:45,581
I know time is of
the essence, Major...

535
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:49,168
so I'll be brief.

536
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:55,257
I think it is time

537
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:58,718
to reestablish a permanent
Cardassian presence

538
00:27:58,718 --> 00:27:59,761
aboard
this station.

539
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,430
Nothing too
elaborate,

540
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,307
mind you.

541
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:05,767
A garrison would suffice.

542
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:10,063
I can deploy troops
from my ship immediately.

543
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:14,276
And in return, I'll solve
your current dilemma.

544
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:17,154
Well, you know I'm never going
to agree to that.

545
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:19,948
I'm not sure you have
much of a choice here.

546
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:23,494
Dukat, you and I both know

547
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:27,956
neither Bajor nor the Federation
will ever honor an agreement

548
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,416
negotiated under
a death threat.

549
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:32,169
(<i> laughs</i> )

550
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:34,880
I don't expect them
to be happy about it.

551
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,424
But once my troops
are in place,

552
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:41,428
I think you'll find it very
difficult to get them to leave.

553
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,639
Well, let me put
this another way.

554
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:47,393
I will destroy this station

555
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:51,564
before I ever give it back
to the Cardassians.

556
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:56,026
Yes... I'm sure you would.

557
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:03,659
But...

558
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:08,163
would you allow 2,000
people aboard this station

559
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:14,545
to die simply because
you don't like... us?

560
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:24,430
Hmm.

561
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,098
Well...

562
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:30,143
there's no need
to decide just yet.

563
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:33,897
We still have
a little time left.

564
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:39,903
30 minutes, in fact.

565
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:42,322
Why don't I
return to my ship

566
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:45,659
so that you'll have time
to think about it?

567
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:47,286
Hmm?

568
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,589
I'll be back...

569
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:01,508
in, say, 25 minutes.

570
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:05,512
Dukat. One
to transport.

571
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:06,722
Energize.

572
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:13,395
Energize.

573
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:16,064
CARDASSIAN:
Dukat, if you are seeing
this recording,

574
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,150
it means you tried
to abandon your post

575
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,526
while the station's

576
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:21,903
self- destruct sequence
was engaged.

577
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,656
That will not be permitted.

578
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:25,616
This is outrageous!

579
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:28,952
You have lost control of Terok
Nor, disgracing yourself

580
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:31,330
and Cardassia.
Your attempt

581
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:35,959
to escape is no doubt
a final act of cowardice.

582
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,878
All fail-safes
have been eliminated.

583
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:42,966
Your personal access codes
have been rescinded.

584
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:45,761
The destruct sequence
can no longer be halted.

585
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:48,430
All you can do now
is contemplate

586
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,932
the depth of your disgrace,

587
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:54,812
and try to die
like a Cardassian.

588
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:07,658
DUKAT:
Computer, abort
the self-destruct sequence.

589
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:13,038
This is a priority one override,
clearance level 9.

590
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:20,045
Authorization:
Dukat 5116 green.

591
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,297
COMPUTER:
Request denied.

592
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,676
All authorization codes
are void.

593
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:27,886
Time to self-destruct:
25 minutes.

594
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,305
(<i> laughs</i> )

595
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:33,266
Even your own computer
program turns against you.

596
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:36,269
I always knew
your shortsightedness

597
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,564
would be your downfall.

598
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:42,942
I don't see you coming up
with any ideas, tailor.

599
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,986
Look, if you two are
finished with the insults,

600
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,113
we could use some help here.

601
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:49,157
Now, what can you tell us about
the self-destruct sequence?

602
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,534
It's very simple.

603
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:52,452
When the countdown
is completed,

604
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:55,789
the computer will order
the main fusion reactor

605
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:57,833
to disengage the
reaction stabilizers,

606
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:04,381
causing it to overload,
destroying the station.

607
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:05,465
What about the reactor?

608
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,092
Is there any way
to shut it down?

609
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:11,054
It may be possible
to manually disengage

610
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:14,224
the laser fusion initiator,
but in order to do that,

611
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:16,643
we have to be
in the reactor room.

612
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,061
DAX:
Not necessarily.

613
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,605
We can disengage the initiator

614
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:22,274
from one of the control
junctions on level 34.

615
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:25,110
But now the computer's
wiped out the access codes,

616
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,320
not even a Cardassian
can get out of this room.

617
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,281
Well, then maybe
we should concentrate

618
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,366
on trying to eliminate the force
field protecting the door.

619
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,285
We don't have time
to eliminate

620
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,621
every force field
between here and level 34.

621
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:39,124
What we need to do
is find a way to deactivate

622
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:41,960
all the force fields
on the station at the same time.

623
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,760
Okay, that should do it.

624
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,344
If we use much more,
we run the risk

625
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,430
of bringing the whole room
down around our ears.

626
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:09,404
SISKO:
All right, we'd
better take cover.

627
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:16,244
Would you... like
to do the honors, sir?

628
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,332
Keep your heads down.

629
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:37,265
JAKE:
It worked!

630
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:02,541
I set up this program,
and I assure you, Major,

631
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:05,878
I will find a way
to defeat it.

632
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:08,463
There is no dilemma
that cannot be solved

633
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,924
by a disciplined
Cardassian mind.

634
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:13,844
It's not going
to work, you know.

635
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:15,721
What are you
babbling on about now?

636
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:17,931
I'm talking about Major Kira.

637
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:20,017
What about her?

638
00:34:20,017 --> 00:34:21,894
She's much too busy
trying to save this station

639
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:24,688
to be impressed
with your incessant posturing.

640
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:25,814
Garak!

641
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:27,649
And even
if she weren't,

642
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:30,276
she has much better taste
than to be attracted to you.

643
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:33,947
You, a married man.

644
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:36,783
I should have executed you
years ago.

645
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,869
Oh, you tried, remember?

646
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:40,119
BASHIR:
Garak.

647
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,580
This isn't helping.

648
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,622
Wait a minute.

649
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:45,625
What about the
power supply grid?

650
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:49,337
If we could overload
the grid, we might be able

651
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,506
to cause a power surge
and short out

652
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,132
all the force fields
on the station.

653
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,467
KIRA:
It might
even be enough

654
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,302
to eliminate
the dampening field

655
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:58,055
that's been keeping us
from using our communicators.

656
00:34:58,055 --> 00:34:59,890
Tell me something, Major.

657
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:03,852
The Cardassian
neutralization emitters

658
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:05,854
that were under here--

659
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:07,814
I assume you
deactivated them

660
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:10,776
when you took control
of this station?
That's right.

661
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:12,903
We prefer our
containment fields
to be nonlethal.

662
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:15,655
But are the emitters
still in place?

663
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,783
As far as I know.
Excellent!

664
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:20,410
That means that they
have not been affected

665
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,955
by the counterinsurgency
program.

666
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:26,458
That means, we still
have control of them.

667
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:27,584
DAX:
Then, if we can get
the emitters

668
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:29,168
back on line,
we can use them

669
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:32,297
to overload
the power grid.
Exactly.

670
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,716
Do you think it'll be enough
to eliminate the force fields?

671
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:37,928
Unfortunately, we'll lose
the turbolifts
and the transporters

672
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:40,430
but they aren't much use
to us right now anyway.

673
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,683
Let's give it a try.

674
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:44,935
SISKO:
Anything?

675
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:46,645
I only got a couple
a hundred meters

676
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,480
and I was stopped
by a force field.
How about you?

677
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,107
JAKE:
We didn't even
get that far.

678
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:53,234
There's got to be
some way up to Ops.

679
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:55,821
The turbolift shaft!

680
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:57,739
We can climb it
all the way to Ops.

681
00:35:57,739 --> 00:36:00,575
Let's see if we can get
these doors open.

682
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,452
Dukat, we're running
out of time.

683
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:04,203
I am almost done.

684
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:09,751
I've got the emitters wired
into the control panel.

685
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:14,339
Now, all I have to do
is reattach them...

686
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:17,801
to the power grid,
like so.

687
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:18,927
All right.

688
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:20,386
I'm ready.

689
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,388
Brace yourselves.

690
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:27,644
(<i> prolonged explosions,</i>
<i>electrical hissing</i> )

691
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:38,613
(<i> machinery powering down</i> )

692
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:41,491
Kira to Sisko.
Go ahead, Major.

693
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:44,077
Oh, Commander,
am I glad to hear you.
What's your location?

694
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:45,704
Level 29, Section D.

695
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,956
What's your status in Ops?

696
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:49,624
We've got about ten minutes
before the main reactor core

697
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,501
overloads
and destroys the station.

698
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:53,628
The only way to stop it
is to disengage

699
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,172
the laser fusion initiator

700
00:36:55,172 --> 00:36:57,256
at one of the control
junctions on level 34,

701
00:36:57,256 --> 00:37:00,177
but the turbolifts
and transporters are off-line.

702
00:37:00,177 --> 00:37:02,095
They'll never
get there in time.

703
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:03,889
But we might.

704
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:05,348
Major, Mr. O'Brien and I
will handle the reactor.

705
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,142
You begin evacuating
the station.

706
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:08,852
Get as many people as you can

707
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,436
to the<i> Defiant</i>
and the runabouts.

708
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:12,397
KIRA:
Understood. Good luck.

709
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:14,733
Jake, I want you to head
for Runabout Pad C.

710
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,484
It's too far.
I'll never make it.

711
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,695
Listen to me, Jake!
I'm going with you.

712
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:22,991
All right.

713
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:25,118
Let's go.

714
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:36,295
COMPUTER:
Warning. Main fusion reactors
will overload in seven minutes.

715
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:38,090
Tell me something
I don't already know.

716
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,175
KIRA:
Kira to Odo.

717
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:41,634
Go ahead, Major.

718
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:44,763
We're beginning
evacuation procedures.

719
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:46,389
The force fields
have been deactivated

720
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:49,226
and all the doors on the station
should be operable.

721
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:52,812
All except one.

722
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,440
It seems the force field
around my office

723
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,942
is still in operation.

724
00:37:56,942 --> 00:37:59,527
I'll send a work team
down immediately.

725
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:03,740
COMPUTER:
Warning. Main fusion reactors
will overload in six minutes.

726
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,409
Are you telling me
we're the only ones
still locked in?

727
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,245
This force field must be

728
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:10,580
on a separate system
from the others.

729
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,207
But why go to
so much trouble

730
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:14,500
to keep people out of
the security office?

731
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,420
It's not to
keep people out.
It's to keep me in.

732
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,589
I suppose, during
the occupation,

733
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:21,091
the Cardassians considered

734
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:23,093
their Security Chief
a security risk.

735
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:25,595
And I know why.
Oh, do you?

736
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:28,389
It's because they knew you
were an honorable man--

737
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,850
the kind of person who
would do the right thing

738
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,019
regardless of
the circumstances.

739
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:36,481
And now, your integrity...

740
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,608
is going to get us
both killed.

741
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:40,526
I hope you're happy.

742
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:48,618
COMPUTER:
Warning. Main fusion reactors

743
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:50,620
will overload in five minutes.

744
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,371
Chief, did you
ever finish

745
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:54,040
those upgrades on
the deflector shields?

746
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,208
Yeah. Why?

747
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:56,417
We may not have time

748
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,003
to disengage the
fusion initiator.

749
00:38:58,003 --> 00:38:59,796
What if we directed
the explosion

750
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:02,132
<i>into</i> the shields?
That's not a bad idea.

751
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:03,800
The shields are the only thing
on the station

752
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,718
that can absorb
that much energy.

753
00:39:15,312 --> 00:39:17,480
That power surge we felt
must have blown out

754
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,607
one of the plasma conduits.

755
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,359
The corridor's completely
blocked for the next 50 meters.

756
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,528
Can't we get around it?

757
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:24,737
We don't have time.

758
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:28,241
There might be a way.

759
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:31,786
There's a maintenance conduit
adjacent to this corridor.

760
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,205
If it's not blocked,

761
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:36,666
we might be able to
get around the debris

762
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,626
and get to
the reactor control junction.

763
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:39,794
Give me a hand.

764
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,766
I can feel heat
through the door.

765
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:02,567
What's wrong?

766
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:04,402
See for yourself.

767
00:40:11,201 --> 00:40:15,247
COMPUTER:
Warning. Main fusion reactors
will overload in three minutes.

768
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:16,539
I want you to wait here.

769
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:17,790
Ah, but...

770
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,042
I mean it
this time.

771
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:27,717
I'll go first.

772
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:30,220
Follow five
meters behind me.

773
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,555
If one of us runs
into trouble in here...

774
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:33,890
I know, I know.

775
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:36,475
The other one
keeps on going.

776
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:53,993
(<i> cries out</i> )

777
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:06,505
(<i> yells</i> )

778
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:09,217
(<i> groaning</i> )

779
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:12,762
O'Brien!

780
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,732
(<i> groaning</i> )

781
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:48,673
COMPUTER:
Warning. Main fusion reactors
will overload in 90 seconds.

782
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:50,342
Sisko to O'Brien.

783
00:41:50,342 --> 00:41:52,593
Chief, can you hear me?

784
00:41:54,304 --> 00:41:57,182
Chief, answer me!

785
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:06,983
COMPUTER:
Warning. Main fusion reactors
will overload in 60 seconds.

786
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:13,156

00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:24,542
Warning. Main fusion reactors

788
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,468
(<i> coughing</i> )

789
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:49,901
Jake... I thought
your father told you

790
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:52,278
to stay out of there.

791
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:57,367
If you don't
tell him, I won't.

792
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:05,250
COMPUTER:
Warning. Main fusion
reactor overload.

793
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:24,852
(<i> panting</i> )

794
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,396
(<i> sighs</i> )

795
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:31,984
O'Brien to Sisko.

796
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:33,361
Chief, you're all right?

797
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:38,824
Yeah, looks like we all are.

798
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:48,334
Ah. It's about time.

799
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:50,628
All right, Quark,
you can leave now.

800
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,214
"A self-important
con artist

801
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:55,091
"who's nowhere
near as clever

802
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:57,218
as he thinks he is."

803
00:43:57,218 --> 00:44:00,597
That's your official
security evaluation of me.

804
00:44:00,597 --> 00:44:03,182
Quark, I told you
to stay away
from the computer.

805
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:05,893
Two hours ago,
you told me

806
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:08,354
I was the most devious
Ferengi you ever met.

807
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:11,149
I thought we
were going to die.
I was trying to be nice.

808
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:13,776
Name one Ferengi
who's more
devious than I am.

809
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:14,902
Grand Nagus.

810
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:16,946
All right.
Name another.

811
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:17,989
DaiMon Tye.

812
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:19,865
One you
personally know.

813
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:20,992
Your brother Rom.

814
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:22,034
My brother?

815
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:23,536
Your Uncle Frin.

816
00:44:23,536 --> 00:44:24,703
Frin?

817
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,247
Your cousin, Gaila.

818
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:28,291
Gaila! The one
with the moon?
