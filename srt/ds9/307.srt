1
00:00:14,094 --> 00:00:15,461
How's it going, Jake?

2
00:00:15,498 --> 00:00:16,592
Fine. I've deleted

3
00:00:16,634 --> 00:00:19,334
half the Cardassian files
from the computer.

4
00:00:19,374 --> 00:00:21,345
I can't believe how many
subroutines it took

5
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:22,746
just to run this ore processor.

6
00:00:22,783 --> 00:00:25,689
Well, it used to be
a pretty large operation.

7
00:00:25,724 --> 00:00:27,592
When the Cardassians
were in charge

8
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:30,193
I understand they processed
20,000 tons a day.

9
00:00:30,235 --> 00:00:31,602
That's a lot of ore.

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,634
It must've been hell in here.

11
00:00:33,678 --> 00:00:34,942
I heard stories

12
00:00:34,981 --> 00:00:37,681
the temperature
reached 55 degrees Celsius.

13
00:00:37,721 --> 00:00:40,057
How could the Bajoran
workers survive that?

14
00:00:40,094 --> 00:00:42,532
Oh, a lot of them didn't.

15
00:00:43,771 --> 00:00:45,366
When you've deleted
all those files

16
00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:48,143
I'll show you how to download
the new operating system.

17
00:00:48,216 --> 00:00:50,586
You really think
we can convert this place

18
00:00:50,622 --> 00:00:52,114
into a deuterium refinery?

19
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:53,150
Absolutely.

20
00:00:53,195 --> 00:00:54,391
It'll take us three...

21
00:00:54,432 --> 00:00:56,062
maybe four weeks at most.

22
00:00:56,103 --> 00:00:58,165
I hope you're planning on eating

23
00:00:58,275 --> 00:01:00,770
during the next
three or four weeks.

24
00:01:00,815 --> 00:01:03,983
Commander, I guess I lost track
of the time.

25
00:01:04,023 --> 00:01:06,291
We're almost finished, Dad.

26
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:08,801
Chief, I'm having a problem
deleting one of these files.

27
00:01:08,836 --> 00:01:12,038
Have you tried reformatting
the data cluster?

28
00:01:12,077 --> 00:01:14,139
Yeah, but the file's still here.

29
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,776
Here, let me see.

30
00:01:17,692 --> 00:01:19,059
Well, that's odd.

31
00:01:19,095 --> 00:01:21,363
What's that, Chief?

32
00:01:21,402 --> 00:01:24,433
Well, the file has no name,
no indication what it is.

33
00:01:24,476 --> 00:01:26,710
I better set it aside for now.

34
00:01:26,749 --> 00:01:28,845
I can transfer it
to the central database in Ops

35
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:30,221
and analyze it in the morning.

36
00:01:32,898 --> 00:01:34,026
Wait a minute.

37
00:01:34,068 --> 00:01:35,971
Unauthorized computer entry

38
00:01:36,006 --> 00:01:39,174
detected
in Ore Processing Unit 5.

39
00:01:39,214 --> 00:01:40,649
Enter access code.

40
00:01:42,757 --> 00:01:44,090
Incorrect code.

41
00:01:44,127 --> 00:01:47,864
You have five seconds
to enter correct access code.

42
00:01:47,903 --> 00:01:48,894
Or what?

43
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,278
I don't know,
but I better stop it.

44
00:01:57,729 --> 00:01:59,255
Warning.

45
00:01:59,367 --> 00:02:02,865
Worker revolt in progress
in Ore Processing Unit 5.

46
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:05,347
Security countermeasures
initiated.

47
00:02:05,382 --> 00:02:07,410
What the hell?

48
00:02:08,457 --> 00:02:11,898
Bajoran workers,
your attention, please.

49
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:14,964
Your attempt to seize
control of this facility

50
00:02:15,008 --> 00:02:16,375
is going to fail.

51
00:02:16,411 --> 00:02:19,681
You are valuable workers,
and we wish you no harm.

52
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,694
However, if you do not
return control of this unit

53
00:02:22,728 --> 00:02:24,596
to your Cardassian supervisors

54
00:02:24,632 --> 00:02:26,660
we will be forced
to take action.

55
00:02:26,704 --> 00:02:30,237
You have eight minutes
to make your decision.

56
00:04:31,006 --> 00:04:33,444
The computer's engaged
the magnetic seal.

57
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:34,812
I can't override it.

58
00:04:34,849 --> 00:04:36,011
Ops to Sisko.

59
00:04:36,052 --> 00:04:37,180
Go ahead.

60
00:04:37,222 --> 00:04:39,022
Commander, what is
going on down there?

61
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,057
We just got a recorded message
from Gul Dukat

62
00:04:42,102 --> 00:04:44,096
regarding some worker revolt
in the ore processing facility?

63
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,202
We saw the same message.

64
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:47,805
It seems we've tripped

65
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,949
some kind of automated security
program the Cardassians left.

66
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:52,221
We're locked in.

67
00:04:52,261 --> 00:04:54,255
Oh, we'll beam you out of there.

68
00:04:54,299 --> 00:04:56,395
Enter access code.

69
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:58,467
What?

70
00:04:58,511 --> 00:05:00,983
If this security program
thinks there's been

71
00:05:01,017 --> 00:05:02,715
some kind of worker's revolt,
then it must think

72
00:05:02,755 --> 00:05:04,419
this station is still
under Cardassian rule.

73
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:06,727
So it's probably waiting for us
to enter an emergency code.

74
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:09,431
One that the Cardassians
never bothered to give us

75
00:05:09,472 --> 00:05:10,600
when they left.

76
00:05:10,642 --> 00:05:11,702
Odo to Ops.

77
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:12,941
Kira here.

78
00:05:12,981 --> 00:05:15,681
My Cardassian access codes
are still valid.

79
00:05:15,721 --> 00:05:18,695
I'm attempting to override
the security program

80
00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:20,096
but it's going
to take some time.

81
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:22,833
I'm not sure my clearance level
is high enough.

82
00:05:22,874 --> 00:05:23,865
Well, keep at it.

83
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:25,709
We'll try to do the same thing
from up here.

84
00:05:25,747 --> 00:05:26,909
Acknowledged.

85
00:05:28,455 --> 00:05:31,554
Odo, do you mind telling me
what this is all about?

86
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:34,365
That message from Dukat
is making my customers nervous.

87
00:05:34,403 --> 00:05:36,169
And when they're nervous,
they're not...

88
00:05:36,242 --> 00:05:37,175
Not now, Quark.

89
00:05:37,245 --> 00:05:39,113
I'm busy.

90
00:05:39,149 --> 00:05:41,017
Well, is there anything
I can do to help?

91
00:05:41,054 --> 00:05:42,387
Not unless you have

92
00:05:42,424 --> 00:05:45,694
a level 9 Cardassian
security clearance.

93
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:47,100
Let's see.

94
00:05:47,137 --> 00:05:50,202
I think I have everything
from levels 1 through 7.

95
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:54,051
I only have levels 1 through 6.

96
00:05:54,088 --> 00:05:56,059
Well.
If you'd like a level 7

97
00:05:56,093 --> 00:05:58,793
I'm sure we can make
some kind of arrangement.

98
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,200
Leave me alone, Quark.

99
00:06:00,237 --> 00:06:02,401
Oh, no.

100
00:06:02,443 --> 00:06:05,007
There's something
very wrong going on

101
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:08,183
and this is the safest place
in the whole station.

102
00:06:08,258 --> 00:06:11,756
I think I'll stay right here.

103
00:06:11,801 --> 00:06:12,861
Any luck?

104
00:06:12,904 --> 00:06:14,203
Nothing.

105
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,080
It's probably magnetically
sealed, like the door.

106
00:06:18,117 --> 00:06:20,749
We'd need a phaser
to blast it open.

107
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,350
Well, there's no way

108
00:06:22,395 --> 00:06:25,061
I can disable
the program from here.

109
00:06:25,102 --> 00:06:26,537
Bajoran workers

110
00:06:26,573 --> 00:06:29,672
your time is running out,
but it's not too late.

111
00:06:29,714 --> 00:06:33,155
You can still surrender
and save your lives.

112
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:43,607
Computer, this is the leader
of the Bajoran workers.

113
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,280
We surrender.

114
00:06:46,992 --> 00:06:51,493
I'm glad to see
you've come to your senses.

115
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:53,508
Stay where you are.

116
00:06:53,543 --> 00:06:55,103
When Cardassian Security arrives

117
00:06:55,146 --> 00:06:57,208
they will place you into custody

118
00:06:57,252 --> 00:06:59,416
but you will not be harmed.

119
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,588
You have my word.

120
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,533
For whatever that's worth.

121
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:04,560
Now what?

122
00:07:04,604 --> 00:07:06,700
Well, it sounds like

123
00:07:06,743 --> 00:07:10,115
the program is going to wait
for Cardassian security

124
00:07:10,152 --> 00:07:12,020
to enter the all-clear protocol.

125
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:15,555
That'll give us
a few minutes anyway.

126
00:07:19,075 --> 00:07:20,271
What's in here?

127
00:07:20,311 --> 00:07:21,975
Nothing at the moment.

128
00:07:22,016 --> 00:07:24,454
Processed uridium used
to pour down that pipe

129
00:07:24,489 --> 00:07:28,865
to a secondary refining facility
in Level 33 and be purified.

130
00:07:30,605 --> 00:07:31,631
It's not locked.

131
00:07:31,675 --> 00:07:33,737
Since that pipe was filled
with molten uridium

132
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,580
there wasn't any need
for security measures.

133
00:07:35,618 --> 00:07:38,090
Well, it's too narrow
for anyone to escape through.

134
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,594
I can get in there.

135
00:07:40,765 --> 00:07:43,603
Chief, if he can crawl
up this pipe into the machine

136
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:47,844
can he get to the ore shoot
and open that hatch from inside?

137
00:07:49,855 --> 00:07:52,761
Bajoran workers,
you have not surrendered

138
00:07:52,796 --> 00:07:54,197
to Cardassian security.

139
00:07:54,233 --> 00:07:57,766
If you do not do so
in the next three minutes

140
00:07:57,809 --> 00:08:00,977
I will be forced
to release neurocine gas

141
00:08:01,017 --> 00:08:03,855
into the ore processing
facility.

142
00:08:03,891 --> 00:08:06,021
I can do it.

143
00:08:15,354 --> 00:08:16,846
Bajoran workers

144
00:08:16,892 --> 00:08:21,199
you have two minutes left
to give yourselves up

145
00:08:21,237 --> 00:08:24,804
to your Cardassian overseers
and save your lives.

146
00:08:24,845 --> 00:08:26,405
Can you hear me, Jake?

147
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,649
Loud and clear,
but I can't see a thing.

148
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:31,721
There should be a large circular
opening to your right.

149
00:08:31,764 --> 00:08:34,066
Okay, let me see
if I can find it.

150
00:08:34,103 --> 00:08:38,102
Even if you were
to escape this station...

151
00:08:39,116 --> 00:08:40,085
Ow!

152
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,452
Jake-o, you all right?

153
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:44,462
Yeah, I just banged
my head on something.

154
00:08:44,497 --> 00:08:46,127
...back to Bajor?

155
00:08:46,168 --> 00:08:47,194
Wait a second.

156
00:08:47,237 --> 00:08:48,604
There's a junction here.

157
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,340
It feels like it goes
off in two directions.

158
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:53,819
Which way do I go?

159
00:08:53,855 --> 00:08:55,381
Follow this sound, Jake.

160
00:08:56,863 --> 00:08:59,392
Do it again, Dad.

161
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,400
Got it.

162
00:09:02,444 --> 00:09:03,936
I'm in the chute.

163
00:09:03,981 --> 00:09:07,217
There should be
a small access port

164
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:08,691
on one of the walls.

165
00:09:08,727 --> 00:09:09,889
Found it.

166
00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:14,134
Open the hatch
and feel around inside

167
00:09:14,174 --> 00:09:15,143
for a handle.

168
00:09:15,177 --> 00:09:16,578
It should be shaped
like a stirrup.

169
00:09:18,185 --> 00:09:19,245
You know, I never knew

170
00:09:19,287 --> 00:09:21,087
how much this man's voice
annoyed me.

171
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:24,999
I can reach it,
but I can't get ahold of it.

172
00:09:25,036 --> 00:09:27,200
You have to pull
the handle down, Jake.

173
00:09:27,241 --> 00:09:29,509
It's the release for the hatch.

174
00:09:29,614 --> 00:09:31,676
I'm trying!
I can't...

175
00:09:31,719 --> 00:09:33,120
Don't, don't tense up.

176
00:09:33,157 --> 00:09:34,490
Relax.

177
00:09:34,527 --> 00:09:37,831
Now just take a deep breath
and try again.

178
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:41,641
I'm sorry,
but your time has run out.

179
00:09:41,678 --> 00:09:45,279
I was hoping
you would be reasonable.

180
00:09:45,321 --> 00:09:49,856
Rest assured that your deaths
will serve as an example

181
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:54,367
to prevent similar
incidents in the future.

182
00:09:56,284 --> 00:09:58,152
I got it!

183
00:10:10,119 --> 00:10:11,281
Dax!

184
00:10:13,227 --> 00:10:16,326
Maybe if we bypass
the primary command pathway

185
00:10:16,369 --> 00:10:18,363
and cross-connect
the backup with the ODN.

186
00:10:18,407 --> 00:10:23,648
Warning. Workers have escaped
from Ore Processing Unit 5.

187
00:10:23,687 --> 00:10:25,749
Initiating station-wide
counterinsurgency program.

188
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,472
Now what?

189
00:10:33,813 --> 00:10:36,878
Attention, Bajoran workers.

190
00:10:36,921 --> 00:10:40,123
I will not allow
this rebellion to succeed.

191
00:10:40,164 --> 00:10:42,796
If you do not
surrender immediately

192
00:10:42,837 --> 00:10:47,406
I will be forced to kill
every Bajoran on this station.

193
00:11:07,535 --> 00:11:09,438
Wait a second.
I found something.

194
00:11:09,474 --> 00:11:10,534
What is it?

195
00:11:10,577 --> 00:11:12,741
I don't know.
Some kind of room.

196
00:11:14,153 --> 00:11:15,281
It sure is dirty.

197
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,624
Doesn't smell too good either.

198
00:11:21,004 --> 00:11:23,499
Looks like some kind
of loading bay.

199
00:11:28,122 --> 00:11:29,752
You're right.

200
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:33,427
This is where the uridium ore
was separated from the rock.

201
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,134
Then it would be
dumped down that chute

202
00:11:35,175 --> 00:11:36,770
to the processing facility.

203
00:11:41,223 --> 00:11:42,419
Locked.

204
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,694
Chief, is there
another way out of here?

205
00:11:44,732 --> 00:11:46,396
Just back down that chute.

206
00:11:46,436 --> 00:11:49,170
You know where that leads to.

207
00:11:49,211 --> 00:11:52,709
Sisko to Ops.

208
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,017
Sisko to Security.

209
00:11:54,057 --> 00:11:55,026
Try yours.

210
00:11:55,059 --> 00:11:57,030
O'Brien to Ops.

211
00:11:57,064 --> 00:11:59,434
Jake Sisko to anyone
who can hear me.

212
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,342
Something must be interfering
with the signal.

213
00:12:06,489 --> 00:12:08,221
What do we do now?

214
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:10,590
It's no good.

215
00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:12,935
We're completely cut off
from the rest of the station.

216
00:12:12,972 --> 00:12:14,339
There must be some kind

217
00:12:14,376 --> 00:12:16,040
of general dampening field
in place.

218
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,142
It must be disrupting
communications.

219
00:12:18,185 --> 00:12:19,586
All right.

220
00:12:21,093 --> 00:12:23,565
It's time
for a less subtle approach.

221
00:12:27,677 --> 00:12:28,668
Doctor.

222
00:12:39,775 --> 00:12:42,613
Ah, the Cardassians
don't miss a trick, do they?

223
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:44,381
The ironic thing is

224
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,414
that field is probably there
to protect Ops

225
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:48,225
from the hordes
of rebelling Bajorans.

226
00:12:48,263 --> 00:12:50,063
Well, we've got to find a way

227
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,571
of disabling
the security program

228
00:12:51,606 --> 00:12:53,840
or a lot of people
are going to get killed.

229
00:12:53,878 --> 00:12:56,544
If we can regain
control of the main computer

230
00:12:56,586 --> 00:12:59,388
we may be able to wipe
the security program

231
00:12:59,426 --> 00:13:00,622
from its memory.

232
00:13:00,663 --> 00:13:04,298
Now, if I can reroute
the APT relay

233
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:05,672
through the secondary buffer

234
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:08,375
I might get an independent
terminal working.

235
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,650
You know, I've been here
nearly three years

236
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:12,888
and I was just finally
starting to think

237
00:13:12,928 --> 00:13:14,488
of this place as home.

238
00:13:14,532 --> 00:13:17,232
Your "home" was built
by Cardassians, Doctor.

239
00:13:17,273 --> 00:13:18,903
Don't ever forget that.

240
00:13:18,943 --> 00:13:21,643
Well, there's not much chance
of that, is there?

241
00:13:21,684 --> 00:13:24,556
What do you mean, we're trapped?

242
00:13:24,591 --> 00:13:27,325
I mean, we're trapped.

243
00:13:27,365 --> 00:13:28,857
I wouldn't be surprised

244
00:13:28,902 --> 00:13:31,272
if the entire station
is locked down.

245
00:13:31,309 --> 00:13:33,280
But you're a shape-shifter.

246
00:13:33,314 --> 00:13:36,379
Excuse me, a changeling.

247
00:13:36,422 --> 00:13:39,054
So change into something
and get us out of here.

248
00:13:39,095 --> 00:13:42,536
This force field isn't
just protecting the door.

249
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,545
It goes through the bulkheads,
the ceiling, the deck.

250
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:46,912
There's nowhere for me to go.

251
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:48,977
You're telling me
I'm stuck here...

252
00:13:49,088 --> 00:13:50,922
with you?

253
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,223
No...

254
00:13:52,263 --> 00:13:54,997
I'm stuck here with you.

255
00:13:55,037 --> 00:13:57,635
Believe me, a far worse fate.

256
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,488
And stay away from my computer!

257
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:15,347
Again!

258
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,625
Oh, okay. Hold on.

259
00:14:23,477 --> 00:14:25,003
Anything?

260
00:14:25,082 --> 00:14:27,782
Not even a dent.

261
00:14:27,822 --> 00:14:30,921
There has to be something
else we can do.

262
00:14:33,069 --> 00:14:34,869
What about all this ore?

263
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:39,912
As I understand it,
uridium is very unstable.

264
00:14:39,954 --> 00:14:40,923
That's true.

265
00:14:40,956 --> 00:14:42,050
But in its raw form

266
00:14:42,092 --> 00:14:44,530
you need a strong electrical
charge to detonate it.

267
00:14:44,565 --> 00:14:46,057
Can we use that?

268
00:14:46,102 --> 00:14:49,076
Well, if I had some tools,
I might be able to get in there

269
00:14:49,144 --> 00:14:51,308
and yank out
some electrical cable.

270
00:14:59,304 --> 00:15:00,466
Tools.

271
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:12,939
How's it coming?

272
00:15:12,972 --> 00:15:14,100
Almost done.

273
00:15:15,212 --> 00:15:16,408
Jadzia!

274
00:15:18,553 --> 00:15:20,251
Get me a medkit.

275
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:21,624
Easy, Jadzia.

276
00:15:21,661 --> 00:15:23,723
I have to take a look.

277
00:15:23,768 --> 00:15:27,106
I was reaching toward
the ODN conduit

278
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:30,342
and a small force field went off
and it caught my hands.

279
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,567
Well, they're
second degree burns

280
00:15:40,611 --> 00:15:42,343
but I don't think
there's any neural damage.

281
00:15:44,187 --> 00:15:45,919
This should relieve the pain.

282
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:49,364
Warning. Security
in the Operations Center

283
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:50,768
has been compromised.

284
00:15:50,804 --> 00:15:53,174
Initiating counterinsurgency
program level two.

285
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:54,612
Attention, Bajoran workers.

286
00:15:54,647 --> 00:15:56,709
Your failure to surrender

287
00:15:56,752 --> 00:15:59,851
is forcing me
to take stronger measures.

288
00:15:59,894 --> 00:16:04,601
In five minutes, we will
begin pumping neurocine gas

289
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,939
into the Habitat Ring.

290
00:16:05,977 --> 00:16:07,310
Think of your families

291
00:16:07,347 --> 00:16:10,344
as you consider
your course of action.

292
00:16:10,388 --> 00:16:15,801
All Cardassian personnel should
evacuate the area immediately.

293
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:18,737
Habitat Ring.

294
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:20,144
There have to be
hundreds of people

295
00:16:20,181 --> 00:16:21,616
trapped in their quarters
out there.

296
00:16:21,651 --> 00:16:23,246
I believe that's the point,
Major.

297
00:16:24,892 --> 00:16:28,230
Computer,
access code: Garak 1359.

298
00:16:31,911 --> 00:16:33,107
Ironic, isn't it?

299
00:16:33,147 --> 00:16:34,480
The only place

300
00:16:34,518 --> 00:16:37,356
in the galaxy that still
recognizes my access code

301
00:16:37,391 --> 00:16:38,883
is a Bajoran space station.

302
00:16:38,929 --> 00:16:40,900
If you can get past
the force fields

303
00:16:40,934 --> 00:16:42,529
you've got to get out
to the Habitat Ring

304
00:16:42,572 --> 00:16:44,566
and start evacuating
those people before...

305
00:16:44,611 --> 00:16:46,810
I'd like nothing better
than to help my loyal customers

306
00:16:46,849 --> 00:16:48,752
but it's not that simple.

307
00:16:48,787 --> 00:16:52,524
My access code enables me
to move about the station

308
00:16:52,565 --> 00:16:54,867
but, unfortunately,
as you've just seen

309
00:16:54,903 --> 00:16:56,669
the force fields reappear

310
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:58,268
the moment I pass
through a doorway.

311
00:16:58,313 --> 00:16:59,873
Have you tried using your code

312
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,716
to shut down
the security program?

313
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:02,781
Several times

314
00:17:02,824 --> 00:17:05,592
but for some reason
I can't begin to fathom

315
00:17:05,631 --> 00:17:08,035
Gul Dukat chose not to trust me

316
00:17:08,071 --> 00:17:11,808
with his top-level security
codes during the occupation.

317
00:17:11,847 --> 00:17:16,086
Garak, do you know a way
we can stop this neurocine gas?

318
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,685
The only way to do that

319
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:20,100
is to destroy
the life support system.

320
00:17:20,136 --> 00:17:21,537
What are you
trying to do, Garak?

321
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:22,542
Get us all killed?

322
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:24,205
No, wait a minute.
He's right.

323
00:17:24,246 --> 00:17:25,510
The neurocine gas is released

324
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,019
through
the life support systems.

325
00:17:27,054 --> 00:17:29,926
Destroy it and we save everybody
in the Habitat Ring.

326
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:31,693
For 12 hours

327
00:17:31,733 --> 00:17:33,293
and then everyone on the station

328
00:17:33,371 --> 00:17:35,467
will suffocate when
we run out of oxygen.

329
00:17:35,509 --> 00:17:37,207
Well, that gives us 12 hours

330
00:17:37,247 --> 00:17:39,275
to regain control
of this station.

331
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:41,085
Believe me, Major

332
00:17:41,124 --> 00:17:45,123
it's the only way
to save those people.

333
00:17:45,168 --> 00:17:48,472
I believe life support is
controlled from over there.

334
00:17:53,423 --> 00:17:54,490
Get down.

335
00:18:02,978 --> 00:18:05,450
Warning. Counterinsurgency
program level two

336
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:06,885
has been interrupted.

337
00:18:06,921 --> 00:18:10,829
Initiating counterinsurgency
program level three.

338
00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:14,835
My fellow Cardassians

339
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,313
I regret to inform you
that Bajoran workers

340
00:18:17,349 --> 00:18:19,377
have gained control
of this station.

341
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:24,833
In all likelihood, I am dead
or otherwise incapacitated.

342
00:18:24,868 --> 00:18:26,668
But rest assured

343
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:31,013
this station will not be allowed
to remain in Bajoran hands.

344
00:18:31,051 --> 00:18:34,584
However, it is
my duty to inform you

345
00:18:34,627 --> 00:18:37,999
that if you do not regain
control within two hours

346
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:42,342
the station will be destroyed.

347
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,320
Self-destruct sequence
initiated.

348
00:18:55,681 --> 00:18:56,843
Come on.

349
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:00,188
Come on!

350
00:19:00,226 --> 00:19:03,667
Give me that before
you hurt yourself.

351
00:19:05,507 --> 00:19:08,572
I've checked
the entire security complex.

352
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:10,175
There's no way out.

353
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:12,418
I should've listened
to my father.

354
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:15,124
He always warned me
this was going to happen.

355
00:19:15,165 --> 00:19:18,537
What? That you'd spend
your final hours in jail?

356
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,204
I could've told you that.

357
00:19:20,245 --> 00:19:22,239
No.

358
00:19:22,284 --> 00:19:25,622
He warned me
never to leave home.

359
00:19:25,659 --> 00:19:27,927
He said there were plenty
of business opportunities

360
00:19:27,965 --> 00:19:29,195
right outside my door.

361
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:32,641
But, no, I had to follow
the 75th Rule of Acquisition:

362
00:19:32,677 --> 00:19:37,554
"Home is where the heart is, but
the stars are made of latinum."

363
00:19:40,598 --> 00:19:45,099
A lifetime of scheming
and plotting

364
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:47,205
wheeling and dealing

365
00:19:47,249 --> 00:19:48,309
and what has it got me?

366
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,789
One measly little bar.

367
00:19:50,824 --> 00:19:53,798
My Uncle Frin owns 30.

368
00:19:53,832 --> 00:19:55,233
And my Cousin Gaila...

369
00:19:55,269 --> 00:19:58,037
I know... he owns a moon.

370
00:19:58,077 --> 00:19:59,980
I told you that?

371
00:20:00,015 --> 00:20:01,314
Many times.

372
00:20:01,352 --> 00:20:04,885
It's a small moon,
but it's enough to live on.

373
00:20:04,928 --> 00:20:06,295
Oh, come on, Quark.

374
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:08,495
You've done
all right for yourself.

375
00:20:08,537 --> 00:20:09,870
Oh, what do you know?

376
00:20:09,907 --> 00:20:14,112
Quark, I've met
a lot of Ferengis in my time

377
00:20:14,152 --> 00:20:15,621
and the truth is

378
00:20:15,656 --> 00:20:19,929
though some of them
may have been more wealthy

379
00:20:19,967 --> 00:20:22,907
I've never met one more devious.

380
00:20:22,941 --> 00:20:24,410
Really?

381
00:20:24,445 --> 00:20:26,040
Would I lie?

382
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,713
I guess not.

383
00:20:29,491 --> 00:20:31,017
Thank you, Odo.

384
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,501
That means a lot to me.

385
00:20:35,373 --> 00:20:37,276
Now...

386
00:20:37,312 --> 00:20:40,218
can I have the phaser back?

387
00:20:40,252 --> 00:20:41,882
No.

388
00:20:44,898 --> 00:20:46,424
How do your hands feel?

389
00:20:46,469 --> 00:20:47,768
A little better.

390
00:20:47,805 --> 00:20:49,935
Good. I wish
I could have done more

391
00:20:49,978 --> 00:20:52,975
but I won't be able
to repair the damaged tissue

392
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:55,253
until we can get you
to the Infirmary.

393
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,282
Any luck?

394
00:20:56,328 --> 00:20:57,354
Plenty, Major.

395
00:20:57,397 --> 00:20:59,095
Unfortunately, all of it bad.

396
00:20:59,135 --> 00:21:02,599
My personal code can activate
any terminal on this station.

397
00:21:02,644 --> 00:21:04,946
However, that's
the extent of my access.

398
00:21:04,984 --> 00:21:06,921
All I can do
is just look around.

399
00:21:06,955 --> 00:21:10,453
I can tell you
exactly what's going on

400
00:21:10,498 --> 00:21:12,936
but I can't
do anything about it.

401
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,636
As far as I can see,
the only person

402
00:21:15,678 --> 00:21:19,450
who can disable the security
program is Gul Dukat.

403
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,322
Maybe there's a way
to fool the computer

404
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:23,763
into thinking
that you are Gul Dukat.

405
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:26,830
You could try rewriting
your code to match his.

406
00:21:26,874 --> 00:21:29,038
Even if I could,
it wouldn't do any good.

407
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,811
If I were to input his code

408
00:21:30,851 --> 00:21:33,255
the computer would scan
my DNA pattern

409
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,420
to determine
if I really were Dukat.

410
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:38,230
But what if we disable
the sensors in Ops

411
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,504
so that the computer
couldn't scan you?

412
00:21:41,813 --> 00:21:43,305
What a creative idea.

413
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:46,688
It certainly is worth a try.

414
00:21:46,725 --> 00:21:49,699
The question is,
can we disconnect the sensors

415
00:21:49,733 --> 00:21:51,100
without anyone else
getting hurt?

416
00:21:51,136 --> 00:21:52,902
We're just going
to have to take that chance.

417
00:21:52,941 --> 00:21:53,967
We could switch

418
00:21:54,011 --> 00:21:56,951
the sensor input
from the primary scanners

419
00:21:56,985 --> 00:21:57,954
to the backup scanners.

420
00:21:57,987 --> 00:22:00,927
The computer shouldn't
see that as a threat

421
00:22:00,962 --> 00:22:02,830
but it'll blind the system
for a few seconds

422
00:22:02,867 --> 00:22:04,166
while we make the changeover.

423
00:22:04,203 --> 00:22:07,906
If it works, a few seconds
are all I'll need.

424
00:22:07,947 --> 00:22:10,715
Major, I'm going to need a hand.

425
00:22:17,438 --> 00:22:19,933
Well, tell me, Doctor,
what is it exactly

426
00:22:19,979 --> 00:22:22,315
about this situation
that's making you smile?

427
00:22:22,351 --> 00:22:23,320
You, Garak.

428
00:22:23,354 --> 00:22:24,380
Hmm?

429
00:22:24,423 --> 00:22:26,018
Just wondering
how many other tailors

430
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:29,364
can rewrite Cardassian
security protocols.

431
00:22:29,403 --> 00:22:31,237
I wouldn't even venture a guess.

432
00:22:31,274 --> 00:22:32,470
Which reminds me.

433
00:22:32,511 --> 00:22:36,009
Those pants you wanted altered
are ready to be picked up.

434
00:22:36,053 --> 00:22:37,249
Oh, this is a problem.

435
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:38,451
What's wrong?

436
00:22:38,493 --> 00:22:41,091
I always suspected that Dukat
was a little paranoid.

437
00:22:41,133 --> 00:22:44,631
He's left a rather large number
of interrogative subroutines

438
00:22:44,709 --> 00:22:46,612
imbedded in his access code.

439
00:22:46,647 --> 00:22:47,980
Meaning what?

440
00:22:48,017 --> 00:22:51,321
Meaning the computer is
constantly challenging me

441
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,594
to prove that I am
who I say I am.

442
00:22:53,632 --> 00:22:54,965
Lieutenant

443
00:22:55,002 --> 00:22:58,067
how much longer before you can
disable those sensors?

444
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,602
Oh, at least
another ten minutes.

445
00:22:59,648 --> 00:23:01,516
I'm not sure
we have that much time.

446
00:23:01,553 --> 00:23:03,524
In fact, I'm sure we don't.

447
00:23:03,558 --> 00:23:07,763
Warning. Unauthorized use
of command code.

448
00:23:07,802 --> 00:23:10,604
Initiating counterinsurgency
program level four.

449
00:23:20,502 --> 00:23:21,971
On three.

450
00:23:22,006 --> 00:23:23,840
One, two

451
00:23:23,878 --> 00:23:26,316
three.

452
00:23:26,351 --> 00:23:27,216
You did it.

453
00:23:27,253 --> 00:23:29,555
Okay, we have the power cable.

454
00:23:29,592 --> 00:23:33,033
Now, we need to pack
the uridium around the door.

455
00:23:42,357 --> 00:23:44,225
My phaser's on the Ops table!

456
00:23:44,262 --> 00:23:45,458
Can anyone get to it?

457
00:23:50,245 --> 00:23:52,079
The answer, Major, is no.

458
00:23:52,149 --> 00:23:55,180
Well, we can't stay here
and do nothing.

459
00:23:55,224 --> 00:23:56,386
I respectfully disagree, Major.

460
00:23:56,427 --> 00:23:58,091
Nothing is about all we can do.

461
00:24:02,209 --> 00:24:03,473
Let me guess.

462
00:24:03,512 --> 00:24:07,147
Someone tried to duplicate
my access code, hmm?

463
00:24:07,188 --> 00:24:08,350
Dukat!

464
00:24:08,392 --> 00:24:10,956
What the hell
are you doing here?!

465
00:24:10,998 --> 00:24:14,872
A short time ago, I had
a very strange experience.

466
00:24:14,908 --> 00:24:18,543
There I was, patrolling
the Demilitarized Zone

467
00:24:18,585 --> 00:24:22,083
when I received
a distress signal... from me

468
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,725
or at least a recording of me.

469
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:30,077
It seems the Bajoran workers
were rioting on Terok Nor.

470
00:24:31,952 --> 00:24:35,621
I must admit,
it piqued my curiosity.

471
00:24:39,538 --> 00:24:41,737
I see.

472
00:24:41,778 --> 00:24:44,580
The autodestruct program
has begun.

473
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:46,818
Well, well, well...

474
00:24:46,858 --> 00:24:49,022
you are in trouble.

475
00:24:49,064 --> 00:24:51,035
Where's Commander Sisko?

476
00:24:51,069 --> 00:24:53,165
I trust he wasn't vaporized

477
00:24:53,274 --> 00:24:57,981
while asking for one of those
<i>raktajinos</i> he's so fond of.

478
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,182
No, last we heard

479
00:24:59,257 --> 00:25:01,752
he was trapped
in the ore processing unit.

480
00:25:01,797 --> 00:25:03,266
Hmm.

481
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,534
I wish him well.

482
00:25:05,573 --> 00:25:07,441
Well, can you help us or not?

483
00:25:07,478 --> 00:25:09,312
Oh, most certainly.

484
00:25:09,349 --> 00:25:13,291
All I have to do
is enter my command code

485
00:25:13,326 --> 00:25:15,890
and shut down the program.

486
00:25:15,934 --> 00:25:17,130
Well, then do it!

487
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:19,972
All in good time, Major Kira.

488
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,640
All in good time.

489
00:25:21,682 --> 00:25:27,653
But, first, there are
a few things we should discuss.

490
00:25:27,697 --> 00:25:30,865
Red leaf tea, please.

491
00:25:38,391 --> 00:25:40,419
Doctor.

492
00:25:42,101 --> 00:25:43,833
What do you want, Dukat?

493
00:25:43,872 --> 00:25:50,584
You'll find I don't react well
to that tone of voice, Major.

494
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,201
Garak, groveling in a corner.

495
00:25:58,243 --> 00:26:01,149
That alone makes
my trip worthwhile.

496
00:26:02,221 --> 00:26:02,984
Garak!

497
00:26:03,022 --> 00:26:04,355
Easy, Doctor.

498
00:26:04,392 --> 00:26:06,022
It would appear

499
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:09,631
that the computer is
only targeting non-Cardassians.

500
00:26:09,672 --> 00:26:13,239
If you had been on the station
when I designed this program

501
00:26:13,349 --> 00:26:15,252
I would have made an exception
in your case.

502
00:26:15,355 --> 00:26:18,261
Well, you've always
been shortsighted.

503
00:26:18,362 --> 00:26:21,028
It's held you back
over the years.

504
00:26:21,069 --> 00:26:24,475
As I recall, your father
had the same flaw.

505
00:26:24,511 --> 00:26:28,955
My father's only flaw
was trusting you.

506
00:26:28,989 --> 00:26:30,253
Funny, at his trial

507
00:26:30,293 --> 00:26:33,131
your father said
that his biggest flaw was

508
00:26:33,167 --> 00:26:36,141
that his ambition
outweighed his patriotism.

509
00:26:36,175 --> 00:26:39,639
Maybe you two could
settle this at another time!

510
00:26:39,684 --> 00:26:41,314
You're right, Major.

511
00:26:41,422 --> 00:26:46,265
But believe me, Garak, that time
is coming.

512
00:26:46,301 --> 00:26:47,600
Major!

513
00:26:47,638 --> 00:26:51,444
Why don't you join me
in the Commander's office

514
00:26:51,481 --> 00:26:53,885
where we can talk in private?

515
00:26:55,993 --> 00:27:00,460
Oh! I forgot.
The replicator.

516
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:06,811
Well, it's the least I can do.

517
00:27:12,001 --> 00:27:13,904
You can all rise now.

518
00:27:15,343 --> 00:27:16,505
You're safe.

519
00:27:17,682 --> 00:27:19,174
For the moment.

520
00:27:27,542 --> 00:27:29,536
Major.

521
00:27:42,914 --> 00:27:46,252
I know time is of the essence,
Major...

522
00:27:47,594 --> 00:27:49,930
so I'll be brief.

523
00:27:54,545 --> 00:27:55,912
I think it is time

524
00:27:55,948 --> 00:27:59,446
to reestablish a permanent
Cardassian presence

525
00:27:59,525 --> 00:28:00,458
aboard this station.

526
00:28:00,561 --> 00:28:03,831
Nothing too elaborate,
mind you.

527
00:28:03,869 --> 00:28:06,273
A garrison would suffice.

528
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:10,548
I can deploy troops
from my ship immediately.

529
00:28:10,587 --> 00:28:14,928
And in return, I'll solve
your current dilemma.

530
00:28:14,965 --> 00:28:17,837
Well, you know I'm never going
to agree to that.

531
00:28:17,872 --> 00:28:20,674
I'm not sure you have
much of a choice here.

532
00:28:20,713 --> 00:28:24,051
Dukat, you and I both know

533
00:28:24,088 --> 00:28:28,589
neither Bajor nor the Federation
will ever honor an agreement

534
00:28:28,633 --> 00:28:30,159
negotiated under a death threat.

535
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:35,611
I don't expect them
to be happy about it.

536
00:28:35,652 --> 00:28:37,851
But once my troops are in place

537
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:42,027
I think you'll find it very
difficult to get them to leave.

538
00:28:42,068 --> 00:28:44,336
Well, let me put
this another way.

539
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:48,039
I will destroy this station

540
00:28:48,084 --> 00:28:52,391
before I ever give it back
to the Cardassians.

541
00:28:52,428 --> 00:28:56,872
Yes... I'm sure you would.

542
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:08,866
But... would you allow 2,000
people aboard this station

543
00:29:08,905 --> 00:29:15,343
to die simply because
you don't like... us?

544
00:29:23,376 --> 00:29:25,176
Hmm.

545
00:29:25,214 --> 00:29:26,706
Well...

546
00:29:28,054 --> 00:29:30,856
there's no need
to decide just yet.

547
00:29:30,895 --> 00:29:34,564
We still have
a little time left.

548
00:29:37,245 --> 00:29:40,709
30 minutes, in fact.

549
00:29:40,754 --> 00:29:42,988
Why don't I return to my ship

550
00:29:43,026 --> 00:29:46,398
so that you'll have time
to think about it?

551
00:29:46,436 --> 00:29:48,100
Hmm?

552
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,364
I'll be back...

553
00:29:59,402 --> 00:30:02,308
in, say, 25 minutes.

554
00:30:03,646 --> 00:30:06,312
Dukat. One to transport.

555
00:30:06,354 --> 00:30:07,482
Energize.

556
00:30:11,631 --> 00:30:13,967
Energize.

557
00:30:14,004 --> 00:30:16,670
Dukat, if you are seeing
this recording

558
00:30:16,711 --> 00:30:19,047
it means you tried
to abandon your post

559
00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:22,490
while the station's self-
destruct sequence was engaged.

560
00:30:22,526 --> 00:30:24,292
That will not be permitted.

561
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:26,096
This is outrageous!

562
00:30:26,135 --> 00:30:29,599
You have lost control of Terok
Nor, disgracing yourself

563
00:30:29,645 --> 00:30:30,944
and Cardassia.

564
00:30:30,981 --> 00:30:32,143
Your attempt

565
00:30:32,184 --> 00:30:36,423
to escape is no doubt
a final act of cowardice.

566
00:30:36,462 --> 00:30:39,368
All fail-safes
have been eliminated.

567
00:30:39,403 --> 00:30:43,402
Your personal access codes
have been rescinded.

568
00:30:43,447 --> 00:30:46,285
The destruct sequence
can no longer be halted.

569
00:30:46,321 --> 00:30:48,953
All you can do now
is contemplate

570
00:30:48,995 --> 00:30:51,433
the depth of your disgrace

571
00:30:51,468 --> 00:30:55,433
and try to die
like a Cardassian.

572
00:31:03,231 --> 00:31:08,541
Computer, abort
the self-destruct sequence.

573
00:31:08,646 --> 00:31:13,956
This is a priority one override,
clearance level 9.

574
00:31:13,993 --> 00:31:21,207
Authorization:
Dukat 5116 green.

575
00:31:21,245 --> 00:31:23,341
Request denied.

576
00:31:23,384 --> 00:31:26,688
All authorization codes
are void.

577
00:31:26,726 --> 00:31:28,994
Time to self-destruct:
25 minutes.

578
00:31:30,201 --> 00:31:34,304
Even your own computer program
turns against you.

579
00:31:34,345 --> 00:31:37,410
I always knew
your shortsightedness

580
00:31:37,454 --> 00:31:39,550
would be your downfall.

581
00:31:39,592 --> 00:31:44,059
I don't see you coming up
with any ideas, tailor.

582
00:31:44,105 --> 00:31:46,042
Look, if you two are
finished with the insults

583
00:31:46,076 --> 00:31:47,272
we could use some help here.

584
00:31:47,313 --> 00:31:49,877
Now, what can you tell us about
the self-destruct sequence?

585
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,081
It's very simple.

586
00:31:51,123 --> 00:31:53,425
When the countdown is completed

587
00:31:53,462 --> 00:31:56,960
the computer will order
the main fusion reactor

588
00:31:57,004 --> 00:31:59,134
to disengage
the reaction stabilizers

589
00:31:59,177 --> 00:32:05,353
causing it to overload,
destroying the station.

590
00:32:05,393 --> 00:32:06,589
What about the reactor?

591
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,362
Is there any way
to shut it down?

592
00:32:08,401 --> 00:32:12,104
It may be possible
to manually disengage

593
00:32:12,143 --> 00:32:15,481
the laser fusion initiator,
but in order to do that

594
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,753
we have to be
in the reactor room.

595
00:32:17,792 --> 00:32:19,091
Not necessarily.

596
00:32:19,129 --> 00:32:20,759
We can disengage the initiator

597
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,328
from one of the control
junctions on level 34.

598
00:32:23,372 --> 00:32:26,210
But now the computer's
wiped out the access codes

599
00:32:26,247 --> 00:32:28,343
not even a Cardassian
can get out of this room.

600
00:32:28,385 --> 00:32:29,980
Well, then maybe
we should concentrate

601
00:32:30,023 --> 00:32:32,587
on trying to eliminate the force
field protecting the door.

602
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:33,963
We don't have time
to eliminate

603
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,838
every force field
between here and level 34.

604
00:32:36,875 --> 00:32:40,213
What we need to do
is find a way to deactivate

605
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,190
all the force fields
on the station at the same time.

606
00:32:48,572 --> 00:32:50,908
Okay, that should do it.

607
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,436
If we use much more,
we run the risk

608
00:32:52,482 --> 00:32:54,612
of bringing the whole room
down around our ears.

609
00:33:08,256 --> 00:33:10,558
All right,
we'd better take cover.

610
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:17,442
Would you...
like to do the honors, sir?

611
00:33:19,853 --> 00:33:21,517
Keep your heads down.

612
00:33:36,663 --> 00:33:38,497
It worked!

613
00:33:59,255 --> 00:34:03,790
I set up this program,
and I assure you, Major

614
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:07,070
I will find a way to defeat it.

615
00:34:07,109 --> 00:34:09,673
There is no dilemma
that cannot be solved

616
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:10,741
by a disciplined

617
00:34:10,785 --> 00:34:12,152
Cardassian mind.

618
00:34:12,188 --> 00:34:14,990
It's not going to work,
you know.

619
00:34:15,029 --> 00:34:16,932
What are you
babbling on about now?

620
00:34:16,968 --> 00:34:19,270
I'm talking about Major Kira.

621
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,367
What about her?

622
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:23,075
She's much too busy
trying to save this station

623
00:34:23,117 --> 00:34:26,057
to be impressed
with your incessant posturing.

624
00:34:26,091 --> 00:34:27,082
Garak!

625
00:34:27,127 --> 00:34:28,687
And even if she weren't

626
00:34:28,732 --> 00:34:31,570
she has much better taste
than to be attracted to you.

627
00:34:31,605 --> 00:34:35,103
You, a married man.

628
00:34:35,148 --> 00:34:38,020
I should have executed you
years ago.

629
00:34:38,056 --> 00:34:40,255
Oh, you tried, remember?

630
00:34:40,295 --> 00:34:41,491
Garak.

631
00:34:41,531 --> 00:34:42,795
This isn't helping.

632
00:34:42,834 --> 00:34:43,860
Wait a minute.

633
00:34:43,904 --> 00:34:46,878
What about
the power supply grid?

634
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:50,649
If we could overload
the grid, we might be able

635
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:52,592
to cause a power surge
and short out

636
00:34:52,627 --> 00:34:54,427
all the force fields
on the station.

637
00:34:54,465 --> 00:34:55,627
It might even be enough

638
00:34:55,668 --> 00:34:56,932
to eliminate
the dampening field

639
00:34:57,005 --> 00:34:59,204
that's been keeping us
from using our communicators.

640
00:34:59,244 --> 00:35:01,112
Tell me something, Major

641
00:35:01,148 --> 00:35:04,988
the Cardassian
neutralization emitters

642
00:35:05,026 --> 00:35:07,020
that were under here...

643
00:35:07,064 --> 00:35:09,092
I assume you deactivated them

644
00:35:09,136 --> 00:35:10,800
when you took control
of this station?

645
00:35:10,841 --> 00:35:11,810
That's right.

646
00:35:11,844 --> 00:35:14,078
We prefer our containment fields
to be nonlethal.

647
00:35:14,116 --> 00:35:16,918
But are the emitters
still in place?

648
00:35:16,957 --> 00:35:17,926
As far as I know.

649
00:35:17,959 --> 00:35:19,053
Excellent!

650
00:35:19,095 --> 00:35:21,693
That means that they
have not been affected

651
00:35:21,735 --> 00:35:24,139
by the counterinsurgency
program.

652
00:35:24,175 --> 00:35:27,581
That means, we still
have control of them.

653
00:35:27,618 --> 00:35:28,848
Then, if we can get
the emitters

654
00:35:28,888 --> 00:35:32,158
back on line, we can use them
to overload the power grid.

655
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:33,529
Exactly.

656
00:35:33,566 --> 00:35:35,970
Do you think it'll be enough
to eliminate the force fields?

657
00:35:36,073 --> 00:35:37,372
Unfortunately, we'll lose

658
00:35:37,409 --> 00:35:39,175
the turbolifts
and the transporters

659
00:35:39,214 --> 00:35:41,709
but they aren't much use
to us right now anyway.

660
00:35:42,857 --> 00:35:44,987
Let's give it a try.

661
00:35:45,063 --> 00:35:46,157
Anything?

662
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:47,429
I only got a couple
a hundred meters

663
00:35:47,469 --> 00:35:48,665
and I was stopped
by a force field.

664
00:35:48,705 --> 00:35:49,765
How about you?

665
00:35:49,808 --> 00:35:51,334
We didn't even get that far.

666
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:54,616
There's got to be
some way up to Ops.

667
00:35:54,654 --> 00:35:57,126
The turbolift shaft!

668
00:35:57,161 --> 00:35:58,893
We can climb it
all the way to Ops.

669
00:35:58,932 --> 00:36:00,835
Let's see if we can get
these doors open.

670
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,810
Dukat, we're running
out of time.

671
00:36:03,845 --> 00:36:05,611
I am almost done.

672
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:11,222
I've got the emitters wired
into the control panel.

673
00:36:11,264 --> 00:36:15,674
Now, all I have to do
is reattach them...

674
00:36:15,709 --> 00:36:19,013
to the power grid, like so.

675
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,683
All right, I'm ready.

676
00:36:21,724 --> 00:36:23,695
Brace yourselves.

677
00:36:40,005 --> 00:36:41,304
Kira to Sisko.

678
00:36:41,343 --> 00:36:43,007
Go ahead, Major.

679
00:36:43,046 --> 00:36:44,515
Oh, Commander,
am I glad to hear you.

680
00:36:44,551 --> 00:36:45,520
What's your location?

681
00:36:45,553 --> 00:36:47,045
Level 29, Section D.

682
00:36:47,091 --> 00:36:49,085
What's your status in Ops?

683
00:36:49,162 --> 00:36:51,030
We've got about ten minutes
before the main reactor core

684
00:36:51,067 --> 00:36:52,867
overloads
and destroys the station.

685
00:36:52,906 --> 00:36:54,968
The only way to stop it
is to disengage

686
00:36:55,011 --> 00:36:56,310
the laser fusion initiator

687
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:58,546
at one of the control
junctions on level 34

688
00:36:58,587 --> 00:37:01,527
but the turbolifts
and transporters are off-line.

689
00:37:01,562 --> 00:37:03,533
They'll never get there in time.

690
00:37:03,567 --> 00:37:05,036
But we might.

691
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,700
Major, Mr. O'Brien and I
will handle the reactor.

692
00:37:06,741 --> 00:37:08,871
You begin evacuating
the station.

693
00:37:08,914 --> 00:37:10,178
Get as many people as you can

694
00:37:10,217 --> 00:37:11,652
to the <i>Defiant</i>
and the runabouts.

695
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,556
Understood. Good luck.

696
00:37:13,593 --> 00:37:15,861
Jake, I want you to head
for Runabout Pad C.

697
00:37:15,899 --> 00:37:17,368
It's too far.
I'll never make it.

698
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:18,530
Listen to me, Jake!

699
00:37:18,572 --> 00:37:20,167
I'm going with you.

700
00:37:23,117 --> 00:37:24,279
All right.

701
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,519
Let's go.

702
00:37:33,845 --> 00:37:38,346
Warning. Main fusion reactors
will overload in seven minutes.

703
00:37:38,391 --> 00:37:40,157
Tell me something
I don't already know.

704
00:37:40,195 --> 00:37:42,132
Kira to Odo.

705
00:37:42,167 --> 00:37:43,797
Go ahead, Major.

706
00:37:43,837 --> 00:37:46,675
We're beginning
evacuation procedures.

707
00:37:46,712 --> 00:37:48,376
The force fields
have been deactivated

708
00:37:48,417 --> 00:37:51,391
and all the doors on the station
should be operable.

709
00:37:53,295 --> 00:37:54,890
All except one.

710
00:37:54,933 --> 00:37:57,565
It seems the force field
around my office

711
00:37:57,606 --> 00:37:59,075
is still in operation.

712
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:01,606
I'll send a work team
down immediately.

713
00:38:01,651 --> 00:38:06,152
Warning. Main fusion reactors
will overload in six minutes.

714
00:38:06,196 --> 00:38:08,498
Are you telling me, we're
the only ones still locked in?

715
00:38:08,535 --> 00:38:10,165
This force field must be

716
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,735
on a separate system
from the others

717
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,181
But why go to so much trouble

718
00:38:14,283 --> 00:38:16,517
to keep people
out of the security office?

719
00:38:16,556 --> 00:38:17,582
It's not to keep people out.

720
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:19,562
It's to keep me in.

721
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:21,659
I suppose,
during the occupation

722
00:38:21,703 --> 00:38:23,104
the Cardassians considered

723
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,134
their Security Chief
a security risk.

724
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:26,204
And I know why.

725
00:38:26,314 --> 00:38:27,613
Oh, do you?

726
00:38:27,651 --> 00:38:30,351
It's because they knew you
were an honorable man...

727
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:32,990
the kind of person who
would do the right thing

728
00:38:33,032 --> 00:38:35,060
regardless of
the circumstances.

729
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:38,510
And now, your integrity...

730
00:38:38,547 --> 00:38:40,746
is going to get us
both killed.

731
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:42,653
I hope you're happy.

732
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:51,968
Warning. Main fusion reactors
will overload in five minutes.

733
00:38:52,004 --> 00:38:53,303
Chief, did you ever finish

734
00:38:53,341 --> 00:38:55,437
those upgrades
on the deflector shields?

735
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,744
Yeah. Why?

736
00:38:56,783 --> 00:38:57,809
We may not have time

737
00:38:57,853 --> 00:38:59,483
to disengage
the fusion initiator.

738
00:38:59,524 --> 00:39:00,993
What if we directed
the explosion

739
00:39:01,028 --> 00:39:02,361
into the shields?

740
00:39:02,398 --> 00:39:03,560
That's not a bad idea.

741
00:39:03,635 --> 00:39:05,230
The shields are the only thing
on the station

742
00:39:05,272 --> 00:39:06,468
that can absorb
that much energy.

743
00:39:16,702 --> 00:39:18,970
That power surge we felt
must have blown out

744
00:39:19,007 --> 00:39:20,567
one of the plasma conduits.

745
00:39:20,612 --> 00:39:22,880
The corridor's completely
blocked for the next 50 meters.

746
00:39:22,918 --> 00:39:24,616
Can't we get around it?

747
00:39:24,655 --> 00:39:25,919
We don't have time.

748
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:29,267
There might be a way.

749
00:39:29,301 --> 00:39:33,038
There's a maintenance conduit
adjacent to this corridor.

750
00:39:33,078 --> 00:39:34,411
If it's not blocked

751
00:39:34,448 --> 00:39:37,786
we might be able
to get around the debris

752
00:39:37,823 --> 00:39:39,657
and get to the reactor
control junction.

753
00:39:39,694 --> 00:39:40,856
Give me a hand.

754
00:39:53,063 --> 00:39:55,000
I can feel heat
through the door.

755
00:40:02,587 --> 00:40:03,886
What's wrong?

756
00:40:03,924 --> 00:40:05,724
See for yourself.

757
00:40:12,347 --> 00:40:16,414
Warning. Main fusion reactors
will overload in three minutes.

758
00:40:16,457 --> 00:40:17,892
I want you to wait here.

759
00:40:17,928 --> 00:40:18,897
Ah, but...

760
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:20,456
I mean it this time.

761
00:40:27,586 --> 00:40:28,782
I'll go first.

762
00:40:28,889 --> 00:40:31,453
Follow five meters behind me.

763
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:33,934
If one of us runs
into trouble in here...

764
00:40:33,969 --> 00:40:35,268
I know, I know.

765
00:40:35,305 --> 00:40:37,834
The other one keeps on going.

766
00:41:12,068 --> 00:41:14,062
O'Brien!

767
00:41:45,354 --> 00:41:50,129
Warning. Main fusion reactors
will overload in 90 seconds.

768
00:41:50,167 --> 00:41:51,602
Sisko to O'Brien.

769
00:41:51,637 --> 00:41:54,007
Chief, can you hear me?

770
00:41:55,648 --> 00:41:58,486
Chief, answer me!

771
00:42:03,836 --> 00:42:08,280
Warning. Main fusion reactors
will overload in 60 seconds.

772
00:42:21,949 --> 00:42:25,948
Warning. Main fusion reactors
will overload in 30 seconds.

773
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:51,280
Jake... I thought
your father told you

774
00:42:51,326 --> 00:42:53,798
to stay out of there.

775
00:42:56,472 --> 00:42:58,876
If you don't tell him, I won't.

776
00:43:03,524 --> 00:43:06,726
Warning. Main fusion
reactor overload.

777
00:43:30,594 --> 00:43:33,396
O'Brien to Sisko.

778
00:43:33,435 --> 00:43:34,870
Chief, you're all right?

779
00:43:37,946 --> 00:43:40,248
Yeah, looks like we all are.

780
00:43:47,672 --> 00:43:48,902
Ah. It's about time.

781
00:43:48,942 --> 00:43:52,007
All right, Quark,
you can leave now.

782
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:54,522
"A self-important con artist

783
00:43:54,556 --> 00:43:58,521
who's nowhere near as clever
as he thinks he is."

784
00:43:58,566 --> 00:44:01,972
That's your official
security evaluation of me.

785
00:44:02,008 --> 00:44:04,674
Quark, I told you
to stay away from the computer.

786
00:44:04,716 --> 00:44:07,086
Two hours ago, you told me

787
00:44:07,156 --> 00:44:09,720
I was the most devious
Ferengi you ever met.

788
00:44:09,762 --> 00:44:11,322
I thought we were going to die.

789
00:44:11,366 --> 00:44:12,596
I was trying to be nice.

790
00:44:12,636 --> 00:44:15,200
Name one Ferengi
who's more devious than I am.

791
00:44:15,243 --> 00:44:16,337
Grand Nagus.

792
00:44:16,379 --> 00:44:18,373
All right.
Name another.

793
00:44:18,418 --> 00:44:19,409
DaiMon Tye.

794
00:44:19,454 --> 00:44:21,118
One you personally know.

795
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,388
Your brother Rom.

796
00:44:22,428 --> 00:44:23,419
My brother?

797
00:44:23,465 --> 00:44:24,832
Your Uncle Frin.

798
00:44:24,868 --> 00:44:25,996
Frin?

799
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,633
Your cousin, Gaila.

800
00:44:27,675 --> 00:44:29,646
Gaila! The one with the moon?
