1
00:00:02,696 --> 00:00:06,157
Station Log, Stardate 46910.1.

2
00:00:06,236 --> 00:00:08,172
Chief O'Brien
has escorted his wife

3
00:00:08,207 --> 00:00:11,543
back to Earth to celebrate
her mother's 100th birthday.

4
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:14,106
In the meantime,
the rest of us are trying

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,347
to keep the station
up and running.

6
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:23,028
It's almost as if the
refiltration processors

7
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:25,536
were waiting for
Chief O'Brien to leave

8
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:26,902
before breaking down.

9
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,036
This technology looks like
something the Cardassians

10
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:32,106
must have taken
from the Romulans.

11
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,882
Is that an RCL type-1
matrix field?

12
00:00:34,921 --> 00:00:38,553
Perhaps we should call in
a Romulan repair service.

13
00:00:38,594 --> 00:00:40,119
Or an RCL type-2?

14
00:00:40,164 --> 00:00:42,532
Another <i>raktajino?</i>

15
00:00:42,568 --> 00:00:44,366
It'll keep me up all night.

16
00:00:44,404 --> 00:00:47,068
I can think of better
ways of keeping you up

17
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,206
and they're more fun
than drinking Klingon coffee.

18
00:00:50,248 --> 00:00:52,684
Definitely type-1.

19
00:01:14,258 --> 00:01:15,749
Dax.

20
00:01:18,867 --> 00:01:21,235
I really should be
getting to bed.

21
00:01:21,271 --> 00:01:23,571
May I escort you
to your quarters?

22
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:25,909
That's not necessary, Julian.

23
00:01:25,946 --> 00:01:27,244
Oh.

24
00:01:27,282 --> 00:01:28,944
Well, good night, then.

25
00:01:45,247 --> 00:01:47,649
"Not necessary, Julian."

26
00:01:50,657 --> 00:01:52,991
But not forbidden, either.

27
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,078
Dax.

28
00:02:04,616 --> 00:02:06,209
Yes.

29
00:02:06,252 --> 00:02:08,084
You are Dax?

30
00:02:08,121 --> 00:02:09,714
What do you want?

31
00:02:18,641 --> 00:02:20,109
Dax!

32
00:04:56,403 --> 00:04:57,598
Yes, Major?

33
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:59,836
I'm just not sure, Commander.

34
00:04:59,876 --> 00:05:02,438
What does it look like to you?

35
00:05:02,481 --> 00:05:05,715
It looks like a residual charge
in the graviton generator.

36
00:05:05,753 --> 00:05:07,985
If that's what it is,
it will bleed off.

37
00:05:08,024 --> 00:05:11,360
Let's run a quick level-3
diagnostic, just to be sure.

38
00:05:15,103 --> 00:05:16,833
Bashir to Ops.

39
00:05:16,873 --> 00:05:17,841
Ops.

40
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,002
Three people...

41
00:05:19,044 --> 00:05:23,177
I think they just took Jadzia.

42
00:05:23,218 --> 00:05:26,679
She tried to struggle with them,
and I tried to help, but...

43
00:05:26,724 --> 00:05:28,420
Full station security alert.

44
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:29,861
Secure all turbolifts.

45
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:32,868
Seal off airlocks
on levels four through 12.

46
00:05:32,902 --> 00:05:34,872
Computer, locate Lieutenant Dax.

47
00:05:34,906 --> 00:05:37,502
Lieutenant Dax is on level six,
corridor one.

48
00:05:37,577 --> 00:05:39,409
No, that's where I am.

49
00:05:39,447 --> 00:05:41,279
They just left her combadge.

50
00:05:41,317 --> 00:05:42,717
How long ago, Doctor?

51
00:05:42,753 --> 00:05:44,655
Oh, I'm not sure, really.

52
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,592
What are you doing?

53
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:51,265
We turn right
at the next corridor.

54
00:05:59,483 --> 00:06:01,453
They're managing to avoid
the security tracking grid.

55
00:06:01,487 --> 00:06:03,855
They seem to know a lot
about the station.

56
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:06,327
Then they may know
the speed of our runabouts.

57
00:06:06,362 --> 00:06:07,990
If they do, they probably have

58
00:06:08,032 --> 00:06:09,968
a faster ship
to make their escape.

59
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:12,700
Major, survey all ships in dock
with a high warp capability.

60
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,518
Damn!

61
00:06:19,585 --> 00:06:20,712
What?

62
00:06:20,754 --> 00:06:22,313
That's why we've got
a residual charge

63
00:06:22,358 --> 00:06:23,519
in the graviton generator.

64
00:06:23,627 --> 00:06:25,995
They've disabled
the tractor beam.

65
00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:28,399
We've got eight ships in dock
capable of warp five or more.

66
00:06:28,435 --> 00:06:30,905
Three on docking pylons,
five smaller ones in the ports.

67
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,806
Seal off
all docking ring airlocks.

68
00:06:32,843 --> 00:06:35,541
Security, all duty squads
to the docking ring.

69
00:06:35,614 --> 00:06:38,882
Commence immediate inward
sweep, levels 16 through 21.

70
00:06:55,584 --> 00:06:58,715
I've got them... Airlock 5.

71
00:06:58,757 --> 00:06:59,918
I'm on my way.

72
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:02,395
Security, report to airlock,
corridor five.

73
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,898
We have a hostage situation.

74
00:07:03,932 --> 00:07:06,164
Isolating with
cadderon force fields.

75
00:07:07,204 --> 00:07:10,266
Will you just tell me
what you want?

76
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,635
Move.

77
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:34,113
Force field is down.

78
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:37,284
They know
the security override codes.

79
00:07:37,326 --> 00:07:39,296
They're boarding a ship.

80
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:41,959
I'm trying to speed up
the bleed-off process

81
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,593
in the graviton generator.

82
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:44,866
We lost them.

83
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,214
It's working.

84
00:07:52,252 --> 00:07:55,622
I'm increasing the flow
to the EPS wave guides.

85
00:07:55,692 --> 00:07:57,628
The excess charge
is neutralizing.

86
00:07:58,631 --> 00:07:59,894
Engage tractor beam.

87
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,311
Gotcha.

88
00:08:09,818 --> 00:08:12,653
Bring it in
to Docking Port 6, Major.

89
00:08:22,674 --> 00:08:24,006
Slowly!

90
00:08:25,345 --> 00:08:27,975
Extremities
where I can see them.

91
00:08:28,017 --> 00:08:30,010
You're the Chief of Security?

92
00:08:36,031 --> 00:08:38,228
Are you all right?

93
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:41,502
My name is Ilon Tandro

94
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,511
special envoy from Klaestron IV

95
00:08:43,545 --> 00:08:45,981
in charge of this
extradition procedure.

96
00:08:46,015 --> 00:08:48,349
Extradition? I call this
kidnapping and assault.

97
00:08:48,386 --> 00:08:50,856
You'll find that to be
a valid warrant for her arrest.

98
00:08:50,891 --> 00:08:52,052
The relevant treaty

99
00:08:52,093 --> 00:08:54,188
between Klaestron IV
and your Federation

100
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,062
allows for unilateral
extradition.

101
00:08:56,101 --> 00:08:57,160
And the charge?

102
00:08:57,202 --> 00:09:02,303
The fugitive Dax
is charged with treason...

103
00:09:02,346 --> 00:09:04,782
and the murder of my father.

104
00:09:19,342 --> 00:09:21,812
The warrant says
Dax was responsible

105
00:09:21,847 --> 00:09:24,818
for the death
of General Ardelon Tandro

106
00:09:24,853 --> 00:09:26,321
30 years ago.

107
00:09:26,355 --> 00:09:27,823
30 years ago?

108
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,486
That would have been Curzon Dax.

109
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:33,432
Mmm, when he was on Klaestron IV

110
00:09:33,467 --> 00:09:37,167
as a Federation mediator
during their civil war.

111
00:09:37,207 --> 00:09:39,769
He never mentioned
he'd even been to Klaestron IV.

112
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:40,780
Strange.

113
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:44,116
Not so strange,
considering these charges.

114
00:09:44,154 --> 00:09:46,147
Odo, let me tell you something.

115
00:09:46,191 --> 00:09:49,219
Curzon Dax tended to be
a little cavalier about life

116
00:09:49,263 --> 00:09:51,699
even about his personal
responsibilities

117
00:09:51,767 --> 00:09:52,962
from time to time.

118
00:09:55,074 --> 00:09:57,408
I think that was
part of the reason

119
00:09:57,445 --> 00:09:58,845
I liked him so much.

120
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,473
He had more faults

121
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:04,182
than the usual
socially acceptable Trill.

122
00:10:04,223 --> 00:10:06,420
He was not a murderer.

123
00:10:06,461 --> 00:10:09,057
How about a traitor?

124
00:10:09,099 --> 00:10:11,433
It says Dax betrayed
the Klaestron government

125
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,631
to the rebels.

126
00:10:12,672 --> 00:10:14,072
It's all nonsense, Constable.

127
00:10:14,108 --> 00:10:15,440
I'm telling you I knew the man.

128
00:10:15,477 --> 00:10:20,077
But did you know
the symbiont inside the man?

129
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:29,967
Come in.

130
00:10:33,977 --> 00:10:37,279
I've sent a subspace message
to Klaestron IV

131
00:10:37,315 --> 00:10:39,285
requesting confirmation
of the warrant.

132
00:10:39,319 --> 00:10:42,450
That's the only stall
I could think of.

133
00:10:42,492 --> 00:10:46,329
Now, what the hell's going on,
Dax?

134
00:10:48,002 --> 00:10:49,334
Dax.

135
00:10:49,371 --> 00:10:52,001
If I'm going to help you,
you've got to help me.

136
00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:54,911
I don't expect any help,
Benjamin.

137
00:10:54,948 --> 00:10:56,382
Thank you, though.

138
00:10:56,417 --> 00:10:57,942
Are you crazy?!

139
00:10:57,986 --> 00:10:59,922
Treason and murder...

140
00:10:59,957 --> 00:11:01,357
on Klaestron IV

141
00:11:01,393 --> 00:11:05,423
either of those gets you
the death penalty.

142
00:11:08,973 --> 00:11:11,808
What's the matter with you?

143
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,146
Talk to me, before I have
to let these people take you.

144
00:11:16,186 --> 00:11:20,250
No. I'm sorry, Benjamin,
but no.

145
00:11:31,012 --> 00:11:35,817
We've got 18, 20 years
of friendship behind us.

146
00:11:35,854 --> 00:11:38,324
I'm Jadzia Dax now.

147
00:11:38,359 --> 00:11:40,921
That was Curzon Dax
you knew for 20 years.

148
00:11:40,963 --> 00:11:42,956
So when the Dax part
of you survived

149
00:11:43,001 --> 00:11:44,469
from one host to the next

150
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:46,939
it really didn't take
our friendship along.

151
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:49,308
Benjamin, you know

152
00:11:49,345 --> 00:11:51,542
you're still
my very dear friend.

153
00:11:54,454 --> 00:11:56,947
I'm sorry.

154
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:02,463
You've received
your confirmation, Commander.

155
00:12:02,503 --> 00:12:05,406
Now we'd like to be
on our way with the prisoner.

156
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:07,604
You know, Mr. Tandro,
I kept wondering

157
00:12:07,645 --> 00:12:09,808
why you tried to kidnap
Lieutenant Dax

158
00:12:09,848 --> 00:12:11,977
rather than just present
your warrant to me

159
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:12,987
in the proper way.

160
00:12:13,021 --> 00:12:14,318
I couldn't figure
that out at first.

161
00:12:14,451 --> 00:12:16,215
I trust you have figured out,
Commander

162
00:12:16,322 --> 00:12:19,122
that our extradition treaty
with your Federation

163
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,458
is current and valid.

164
00:12:20,496 --> 00:12:22,523
This station is
technically Bajoran.

165
00:12:22,566 --> 00:12:24,432
What does that mean to us?

166
00:12:24,469 --> 00:12:27,167
You don't have an extradition
treaty with Bajor.

167
00:12:27,207 --> 00:12:29,370
I think that's why you tried
to abduct

168
00:12:29,412 --> 00:12:30,505
Lieutenant Dax.

169
00:12:30,547 --> 00:12:33,382
You were afraid the Bajorans
would refuse extradition.

170
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,546
That's absurd.

171
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,251
No Bajoran interests
are even involved here.

172
00:12:37,359 --> 00:12:40,854
How did you know your way
around this station so well?

173
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:44,133
My conversation
is with the Commander.

174
00:12:44,172 --> 00:12:45,470
No, your conversation

175
00:12:45,507 --> 00:12:47,807
is with my First Officer now.

176
00:12:47,845 --> 00:12:50,475
You Klaestrons are allies
of the Cardassians.

177
00:12:50,516 --> 00:12:52,144
Your knowledge of this station
confirms that.

178
00:12:52,186 --> 00:12:53,518
They must have
given you the layout

179
00:12:53,555 --> 00:12:57,255
which not only compromises
Bajoran security

180
00:12:57,295 --> 00:13:00,756
but also... annoys us.

181
00:13:00,801 --> 00:13:03,795
I'm afraid Bajoran interests
are involved

182
00:13:03,841 --> 00:13:05,970
and Bajor is adamant that...

183
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:08,674
at least, I believe
it's adamant.

184
00:13:08,715 --> 00:13:09,876
Oh. Oh, yes.

185
00:13:09,917 --> 00:13:12,410
You see, there will have
to be an extradition hearing

186
00:13:12,455 --> 00:13:15,517
before I can lawfully
release Lieutenant Dax.

187
00:13:21,037 --> 00:13:22,699
For how long?

188
00:13:22,741 --> 00:13:24,711
As long as it takes.

189
00:13:24,744 --> 00:13:26,714
That could be for days.

190
00:13:26,748 --> 00:13:29,719
Well, there's nowhere else
on the station that's suitable.

191
00:13:29,753 --> 00:13:31,278
That's too bad.

192
00:13:31,323 --> 00:13:34,294
I'm not shutting down
for any Bajoran hearing.

193
00:13:34,328 --> 00:13:37,322
I'm sure Lieutenant Dax
would appreciate it.

194
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,476
Business is business.

195
00:13:42,509 --> 00:13:43,875
Ah.

196
00:13:46,851 --> 00:13:50,312
You know, that wall's
going to have to come in

197
00:13:50,357 --> 00:13:51,757
about five meters.

198
00:13:51,793 --> 00:13:53,763
What are you talking about?

199
00:13:53,797 --> 00:13:56,768
Of course, after you move
the wall, that'll mean

200
00:13:56,802 --> 00:14:00,263
your second-level holosuites
will have to come down.

201
00:14:00,309 --> 00:14:01,777
Come down? Why?

202
00:14:01,811 --> 00:14:03,872
New restrictions.

203
00:14:03,915 --> 00:14:06,010
Restrictions?

204
00:14:06,052 --> 00:14:07,452
Building codes.

205
00:14:07,487 --> 00:14:09,957
Since the provisional
government took over

206
00:14:09,992 --> 00:14:12,462
they've got their hands
into everything

207
00:14:12,496 --> 00:14:14,966
and, of course,
I'm the one who's expected

208
00:14:15,001 --> 00:14:17,062
to enforce their rules here.

209
00:14:17,105 --> 00:14:19,166
Ha.

210
00:14:21,347 --> 00:14:23,817
You know, I think this bar

211
00:14:23,851 --> 00:14:26,845
is just a little
too near the exit.

212
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:30,488
This is blackmail.

213
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:32,863
No, it's just business.

214
00:14:35,338 --> 00:14:38,469
And business is business.

215
00:14:48,795 --> 00:14:50,890
I was just coming to see you.

216
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,959
We still haven't found
a place for the hearing.

217
00:14:53,003 --> 00:14:54,369
Holding it on Bajor
would involve

218
00:14:54,439 --> 00:14:55,372
Dax leaving the station

219
00:14:55,441 --> 00:14:56,739
and I don't want to risk that.

220
00:14:56,777 --> 00:14:58,302
Well, now that's a coincidence.

221
00:14:58,346 --> 00:15:00,475
Our good friend Quark
just donated the use

222
00:15:00,517 --> 00:15:02,145
of his facility
for the hearing.

223
00:15:02,186 --> 00:15:03,552
Nice gesture.

224
00:15:03,588 --> 00:15:05,056
I thought so.

225
00:15:05,091 --> 00:15:06,719
You know, I haven't been able

226
00:15:06,761 --> 00:15:09,197
to get a word out of Dax
about any of this.

227
00:15:09,232 --> 00:15:11,327
So I thought someone
might go do some investigating

228
00:15:11,437 --> 00:15:12,666
on Klaestron IV itself.

229
00:15:12,706 --> 00:15:14,004
What do you think?

230
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,341
This case has 30 years
of dust covering it.

231
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:19,145
The extradition hearing
will take about 30 minutes.

232
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:21,552
I was hoping to make it
a little longer than that.

233
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,581
Good luck.

234
00:15:42,592 --> 00:15:44,390
This will be an informal hearing

235
00:15:44,496 --> 00:15:47,331
so I'm going to start
with some informal advice.

236
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:49,394
I am 100 years old.

237
00:15:49,438 --> 00:15:50,531
I do not have time

238
00:15:50,573 --> 00:15:53,408
to squander listening
to superfluous language.

239
00:15:53,512 --> 00:15:57,076
In short, I intend
being here until supper

240
00:15:57,118 --> 00:15:58,245
not senility.

241
00:15:58,287 --> 00:16:00,119
Understood?

242
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:03,357
Understood, Madam Arbiter.

243
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,695
You seek the extradition.

244
00:16:08,739 --> 00:16:10,207
Make your case.

245
00:16:10,242 --> 00:16:14,204
The accused Trill, whatever
its present appearance may be

246
00:16:14,249 --> 00:16:16,719
was and is a Federation officer

247
00:16:16,754 --> 00:16:19,725
who committed capital
crimes on our planet.

248
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,229
Since there is no time limit

249
00:16:22,263 --> 00:16:24,790
on the prosecution
of such crimes...

250
00:16:24,835 --> 00:16:28,296
Thank you, I have already read
the warrant and the charges.

251
00:16:28,341 --> 00:16:31,312
The crimes described
are 30 years old.

252
00:16:31,346 --> 00:16:33,612
What took you so long?

253
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,950
The evidence was contained
in military files

254
00:16:35,988 --> 00:16:38,959
which were officially sealed
until recently.

255
00:16:38,994 --> 00:16:40,257
Fine. Sit.

256
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:46,437
Commander, the warrant
is in order.

257
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:50,002
On what grounds do you ask
that I deny extradition?

258
00:16:50,046 --> 00:16:52,448
You say the warrant's in order

259
00:16:52,484 --> 00:16:54,954
but the name
on the warrant is Dax.

260
00:16:54,989 --> 00:16:58,450
Certainly that doesn't refer
to Jadzia Dax, a female

261
00:16:58,495 --> 00:17:01,729
but to the now deceased
Curzon Dax, a male.

262
00:17:01,768 --> 00:17:04,739
This young woman wasn't
even born 30 years ago.

263
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,241
You are arguing semantics.

264
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:08,246
This creature is a Trill.

265
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,250
The symbiont known as Dax

266
00:17:10,284 --> 00:17:13,255
has progressed
from one host to the next.

267
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:14,723
Exactly. From one host
to the next.

268
00:17:14,758 --> 00:17:16,283
A different host,
a different person.

269
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,627
So I submit that the person
he wants to extradite

270
00:17:18,665 --> 00:17:20,031
no longer exists

271
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:21,865
and I challenge him
to prove otherwise.

272
00:17:21,904 --> 00:17:23,202
That's ridiculous.

273
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,142
It would have been easier

274
00:17:25,176 --> 00:17:28,979
on me, Commander, had you not
raised that particular point

275
00:17:29,017 --> 00:17:33,458
but the penalty for these crimes
on your planet is death

276
00:17:33,491 --> 00:17:35,461
and that is rather permanent

277
00:17:35,495 --> 00:17:37,829
so before I grant extradition

278
00:17:37,866 --> 00:17:39,334
you will convince me, please

279
00:17:39,369 --> 00:17:42,067
that the person
named in your warrant

280
00:17:42,107 --> 00:17:44,771
is the person
who is standing here now.

281
00:18:03,345 --> 00:18:04,745
She doesn't seem to care

282
00:18:04,781 --> 00:18:06,876
whether she gets
out of this or not.

283
00:18:06,918 --> 00:18:08,614
I care.

284
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,350
Doctor, we've given
the opposition

285
00:18:10,392 --> 00:18:12,692
access to our computers
and station library

286
00:18:12,728 --> 00:18:14,321
so let's utilize them ourselves.

287
00:18:14,365 --> 00:18:17,268
I want you to find
all the medical evidence you can

288
00:18:17,303 --> 00:18:19,398
to support the theory
that Jadzia Dax

289
00:18:19,441 --> 00:18:22,105
and Curzon Dax are two
entirely separate people.

290
00:18:22,146 --> 00:18:23,114
Major...

291
00:18:23,148 --> 00:18:24,275
Excuse me, sir.

292
00:18:24,316 --> 00:18:27,310
I don't know that there is
any medical evidence on that.

293
00:18:27,355 --> 00:18:29,221
Assume there is, then find it.

294
00:18:29,259 --> 00:18:31,786
Major, I'm not asking you
to be an attorney here

295
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,630
but if you could check
the Federation computers

296
00:18:34,668 --> 00:18:35,931
for any precedents...

297
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:38,236
legal decisions
involving Trills.

298
00:18:38,275 --> 00:18:40,802
Is a Trill responsible
for the conduct...

299
00:18:40,846 --> 00:18:43,817
for the acts...
of its antecedent selves?

300
00:18:43,851 --> 00:18:45,479
Right, that kind of thing.

301
00:18:45,521 --> 00:18:47,753
What if I find
the answer is "yes"?

302
00:18:47,792 --> 00:18:49,819
Then that answer is wrong.

303
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:52,993
From this minute on,
our answer is "no."

304
00:18:56,073 --> 00:18:59,978
But if you do find
a wrong answer...

305
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,376
I want to see it.

306
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:04,139
I can't fight
what I don't know about.

307
00:19:04,248 --> 00:19:06,946
Commander Sisko, there's
a subspace communication

308
00:19:06,986 --> 00:19:08,648
from Odo on Klaestron IV.

309
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,453
We only have a few hours,
people.

310
00:19:15,502 --> 00:19:17,836
What have you got for us,
Constable?

311
00:19:17,873 --> 00:19:20,173
Well, I know two things so far...

312
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:23,478
whoever did murder
that General Ardelon Tandro

313
00:19:23,516 --> 00:19:25,178
it got his troops so mad

314
00:19:25,252 --> 00:19:27,950
they went out
and won their civil war.

315
00:19:27,991 --> 00:19:30,291
They made the general
a national hero.

316
00:19:30,329 --> 00:19:33,357
There are statues of him
all over the place.

317
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,496
The second... everyone
that's old enough to remember

318
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:40,205
says the General and Curzon Dax
were the closest of friends.

319
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,645
Comrades, inseparable.

320
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:44,517
Now that sounds
like the Curzon Dax I knew.

321
00:19:44,554 --> 00:19:45,715
But treason...

322
00:19:45,756 --> 00:19:48,226
plus the murder
of his own best friend?

323
00:19:48,294 --> 00:19:49,660
Strange business.

324
00:19:49,696 --> 00:19:51,358
If those charges are true

325
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:54,701
I'd want to hang Curzon Dax
up by his heels myself.

326
00:19:54,739 --> 00:19:56,537
Thanks for the confidence.

327
00:19:56,575 --> 00:19:57,543
Don't worry.

328
00:19:57,577 --> 00:19:58,704
I'll do my job.

329
00:19:58,746 --> 00:20:00,408
The General left a widow.

330
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,510
If the two men were that close

331
00:20:02,553 --> 00:20:05,422
she has to remember something
about Curzon Dax

332
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,051
that's not in the record.

333
00:20:07,094 --> 00:20:08,392
You'll hear from me.

334
00:20:17,948 --> 00:20:22,047
Curzon Dax was not responsible
for the death of my husband.

335
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:23,681
You're certain of that?

336
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:25,056
Without a doubt.

337
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:27,290
But your own son?

338
00:20:27,364 --> 00:20:29,300
My son is obsessed

339
00:20:29,368 --> 00:20:32,738
with the death of a father
he never knew.

340
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:36,303
Oh, I tried to persuade him
not to reopen the case.

341
00:20:36,413 --> 00:20:40,045
He won't listen to anyone,
least of all to me.

342
00:20:40,087 --> 00:20:41,715
You have to understand

343
00:20:41,757 --> 00:20:44,557
Curzon Dax was closer
to the General

344
00:20:44,595 --> 00:20:47,430
than any other man
on this planet.

345
00:20:47,467 --> 00:20:49,903
He was a dear friend
to this family.

346
00:20:49,938 --> 00:20:51,908
Curzon would have died himself

347
00:20:51,942 --> 00:20:54,845
sooner than conspire
against my husband.

348
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,439
Is that a personal opinion

349
00:20:56,483 --> 00:20:58,817
or are there any facts
that would support this?

350
00:20:58,854 --> 00:21:02,486
The only facts I have
are in my son's hands

351
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:04,861
and he intends to use
them against Dax.

352
00:21:04,898 --> 00:21:07,733
It might help my people
to know what they are.

353
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:12,107
There is proof
of a secret transmission

354
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:15,116
that was made
from our military headquarters

355
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,618
to the enemy camp.

356
00:21:16,653 --> 00:21:21,151
It identifies exactly the route
my husband was taking

357
00:21:21,194 --> 00:21:24,325
on his way back
from the capital to the front.

358
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,134
It was at that time that he
was ambushed and kidnapped.

359
00:21:28,174 --> 00:21:30,269
A short time later,
he was killed.

360
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:35,650
Then your son must believe
that Dax made the transmission.

361
00:21:35,687 --> 00:21:38,921
There were only five people,
including my husband

362
00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:40,325
who knew that route.

363
00:21:40,361 --> 00:21:43,822
My son has established the
whereabouts of all of them

364
00:21:43,868 --> 00:21:45,963
at the time of the transmission.

365
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:48,475
All of them except Curzon.

366
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:52,974
So Dax has no alibi.

367
00:21:53,018 --> 00:21:58,483
That cannot possibly be
enough to convict him.

368
00:21:58,528 --> 00:21:59,826
Can it?

369
00:21:59,864 --> 00:22:01,696
I don't know.

370
00:22:04,138 --> 00:22:05,197
Thank you.

371
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,731
You've been helpful.

372
00:22:12,019 --> 00:22:14,353
How is he?

373
00:22:14,457 --> 00:22:15,755
Ma'am?

374
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:18,764
Curzon Dax.

375
00:22:20,668 --> 00:22:22,034
He's gone.

376
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:25,338
The Dax your son is
trying to extradite

377
00:22:25,376 --> 00:22:26,901
is Jadzia Dax

378
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:29,007
a 28-year-old woman.

379
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:31,383
Curzon Dax died two years ago.

380
00:22:31,487 --> 00:22:34,253
Jadzia is the new host.

381
00:22:36,129 --> 00:22:38,258
Wha?

382
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,566
I'm sorry.

383
00:22:40,604 --> 00:22:43,097
I didn't know.

384
00:22:55,598 --> 00:22:59,162
Madam Arbiter, I call
on the expert knowledge

385
00:22:59,203 --> 00:23:01,435
of another Trill, Selin Peers.

386
00:23:04,112 --> 00:23:05,341
Minister Peers

387
00:23:05,381 --> 00:23:07,476
we're fortunate
to have you with us.

388
00:23:07,518 --> 00:23:09,920
Excuse me, it also seems
rather convenient

389
00:23:09,956 --> 00:23:11,151
to have you with us.

390
00:23:11,192 --> 00:23:12,160
How do you come here?

391
00:23:12,194 --> 00:23:13,719
Because another Trill
is involved

392
00:23:13,763 --> 00:23:14,890
the Trillian government

393
00:23:14,932 --> 00:23:17,402
requested that I be present
during the extradition.

394
00:23:17,436 --> 00:23:19,736
And do you know
the accused personally?

395
00:23:21,243 --> 00:23:22,370
I do not.

396
00:23:22,412 --> 00:23:24,609
We accept you
as an expert on Trills.

397
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:25,618
Proceed.

398
00:23:25,652 --> 00:23:27,086
Minister

399
00:23:27,121 --> 00:23:29,785
through how many hosts
have you survived?

400
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,421
The symbiont within me
has survived

401
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:36,162
through the adult lifetimes
of seven hosts.

402
00:23:36,203 --> 00:23:38,639
Do you remember
your very first host?

403
00:23:38,675 --> 00:23:41,009
Of course.

404
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:43,380
It was a woman,
as a matter of fact.

405
00:23:43,417 --> 00:23:47,186
Do you remember
what you thought and felt

406
00:23:47,223 --> 00:23:50,160
when you were joined
with your first host?

407
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:52,563
Yes. The symbiont
does carry memories

408
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,831
of time shared
with previous hosts.

409
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:57,363
So, if a crime
is committed by a Trill

410
00:23:57,408 --> 00:24:00,869
then the symbiont's next host
would remain aware of it...

411
00:24:00,915 --> 00:24:03,147
would recall that crime.

412
00:24:03,186 --> 00:24:05,418
Yes. Absolutely.

413
00:24:05,522 --> 00:24:07,617
Would recall the details of it.

414
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,062
Yes, absolutely.

415
00:24:10,098 --> 00:24:13,194
And would still
feel the guilt of it.

416
00:24:13,237 --> 00:24:15,103
Oh, yes.

417
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,301
Madam Arbiter,
this is not a trial

418
00:24:16,342 --> 00:24:18,642
and Mr. Tandro is
not the prosecutor.

419
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,444
Mr. Tandro,
you have made your point.

420
00:24:20,483 --> 00:24:23,887
I don't believe that I have,
Madam Arbiter.

421
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:26,620
The real point is
that Commander Sisko

422
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:30,827
would have you endorse his idea
of a perfect Trill crime.

423
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:32,462
To commit it, all one has to do

424
00:24:32,505 --> 00:24:34,873
is elude capture long
enough to change hosts

425
00:24:34,909 --> 00:24:38,370
and then he or she can go free.

426
00:24:40,987 --> 00:24:42,819
Minister Peers, you've said

427
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:46,955
you were with your first host
throughout her adult life.

428
00:24:46,998 --> 00:24:48,091
Yes.

429
00:24:48,133 --> 00:24:51,195
So, before a symbiont
is joined with any host

430
00:24:51,238 --> 00:24:52,501
that host has lived

431
00:24:52,607 --> 00:24:55,339
a significant portion
of his or her life

432
00:24:55,379 --> 00:24:57,406
from birth to what age, sir?

433
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,477
Early to mid-20s.

434
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,749
Why not younger?

435
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:05,423
To give the prospective host
a chance to develop, mature.

436
00:25:05,464 --> 00:25:09,062
They have to be old enough
to make an informed judgment

437
00:25:09,104 --> 00:25:12,474
as to whether or not
they really want to be joined.

438
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,572
And once they are joined,
this host's personality

439
00:25:15,616 --> 00:25:18,314
is completely suppressed
by the symbiont.

440
00:25:18,354 --> 00:25:19,322
Oh, no.

441
00:25:19,356 --> 00:25:22,293
No, it's a joining.

442
00:25:22,328 --> 00:25:24,594
It's a total sharing...

443
00:25:24,632 --> 00:25:28,230
a blending
of both symbiont and host.

444
00:25:28,272 --> 00:25:31,175
Neither is suppressed
by the other.

445
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:32,610
So with each new host

446
00:25:32,646 --> 00:25:35,674
there does come, in fact,
a new personality...

447
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:37,210
a new combined person...

448
00:25:37,255 --> 00:25:38,518
a different person.

449
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,958
From that standpoint, yes.

450
00:25:40,995 --> 00:25:43,795
Well, I, for one, don't know
from what other standpoint

451
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,461
we could be talking about.

452
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:46,765
Thank you, Minister.

453
00:25:46,804 --> 00:25:47,931
Just to return us

454
00:25:47,973 --> 00:25:50,535
to what's important here,
Madam Arbiter

455
00:25:50,611 --> 00:25:52,136
the accused can remember

456
00:25:52,182 --> 00:25:54,550
any crimes he committed
as Curzon Dax

457
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:57,089
and nothing can be
truthfully asserted

458
00:25:57,124 --> 00:25:59,822
in this hearing
that can alter that fact.

459
00:25:59,862 --> 00:26:02,731
Yes. The memories were passed
to an entirely new host...

460
00:26:02,767 --> 00:26:04,395
to an entirely
different person.

461
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:05,496
This is outrageous!

462
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:08,941
You-You can't let Dax
get away with murder!

463
00:26:08,978 --> 00:26:13,077
Gentlemen, I said this would be
an informal hearing

464
00:26:13,118 --> 00:26:14,518
not riotous.

465
00:26:14,555 --> 00:26:18,579
We will take a two-hour recess.

466
00:26:28,363 --> 00:26:31,232
The answer seems
simple enough to me...

467
00:26:31,268 --> 00:26:33,397
split her down the middle.

468
00:26:33,439 --> 00:26:36,410
Send the symbiont
back to stand trial

469
00:26:36,444 --> 00:26:38,310
and keep the host here.

470
00:26:38,415 --> 00:26:41,011
I'm afraid it's a bit more
complicated than that.

471
00:26:41,053 --> 00:26:43,421
Oh, what a surprise.

472
00:26:43,457 --> 00:26:44,982
Please enlighten me.

473
00:26:45,026 --> 00:26:48,726
The symbiont and the host
are biologically interdependent.

474
00:26:48,766 --> 00:26:50,632
93 hours after they've joined

475
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:53,163
neither can survive
without the other.

476
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:54,574
I see.

477
00:26:56,246 --> 00:26:58,876
Proceed, Commander.

478
00:26:58,918 --> 00:27:01,821
Doctor, you've heard
the arguments.

479
00:27:01,856 --> 00:27:04,019
From a medical point of view

480
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:07,624
are Curzon Dax and Jadzia Dax
the same person?

481
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:08,896
Certainly not.

482
00:27:08,936 --> 00:27:12,466
Aside from the gender change,
there's a marked difference

483
00:27:12,509 --> 00:27:15,139
in blood types, metabolism,
nervous system

484
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,239
height, weight.

485
00:27:16,282 --> 00:27:18,080
This is not at all relevant.

486
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:21,090
What is relevant, sir...

487
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:23,459
is my analysis
of the brain waves

488
00:27:23,496 --> 00:27:25,432
of Curzon and Jadzia Dax.

489
00:27:25,465 --> 00:27:27,435
Madam Arbiter.

490
00:27:27,469 --> 00:27:31,306
As you can see, they are
distinctly different

491
00:27:31,343 --> 00:27:34,713
which clearly illustrates
that Curzon and Jadzia

492
00:27:34,749 --> 00:27:37,515
are two unique individuals.

493
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,149
Thank you, Doctor.

494
00:27:43,765 --> 00:27:44,926
Doctor...

495
00:27:46,436 --> 00:27:49,134
I've looked through
your research myself.

496
00:27:49,175 --> 00:27:51,168
It's quite impressive
for such a young man.

497
00:27:51,212 --> 00:27:53,182
Thank you.

498
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,709
As a layman,
there are obviously things

499
00:27:55,754 --> 00:27:57,382
I don't fully understand.

500
00:27:57,423 --> 00:27:59,893
I'd be happy
to explain anything you wish.

501
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,419
Yes?

502
00:28:01,463 --> 00:28:07,100
Well, exactly how does
the Trill brain work?

503
00:28:07,141 --> 00:28:09,509
It's quite complicated,
actually.

504
00:28:09,545 --> 00:28:12,448
First of all, there are
two cerebral nuclei...

505
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:13,610
Two?

506
00:28:13,652 --> 00:28:15,815
One in the symbiont
and one in the host.

507
00:28:15,857 --> 00:28:17,120
Two brains.

508
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:20,096
And these two brains
talk to each other?

509
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:21,962
Like two computers
linked together.

510
00:28:22,001 --> 00:28:23,629
That's very clear, Doctor.

511
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:24,797
Thank you.

512
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:28,141
Now, in your investigations

513
00:28:28,178 --> 00:28:33,313
were you able to analyze the...
separate wave patterns

514
00:28:33,355 --> 00:28:35,221
from each of these brains?

515
00:28:35,258 --> 00:28:37,820
They don't function separately.

516
00:28:37,862 --> 00:28:41,494
I didn't ask you
how they function, Dr. Bashir.

517
00:28:41,535 --> 00:28:45,634
I asked if you could analyze
the two distinct patterns.

518
00:28:45,676 --> 00:28:46,939
I don't see the relevance...

519
00:28:46,978 --> 00:28:48,105
Could you?

520
00:28:48,147 --> 00:28:49,274
Yes.

521
00:28:49,316 --> 00:28:51,046
And have the brain wave patterns

522
00:28:51,086 --> 00:28:52,315
of the symbiont changed

523
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,221
since it joined
with its new host?

524
00:28:54,258 --> 00:28:57,286
With the available evidence,
there's no way of telling.

525
00:28:57,331 --> 00:28:58,731
What's your best guess?

526
00:28:58,767 --> 00:29:01,067
I wouldn't care to guess.

527
00:29:01,104 --> 00:29:03,870
In fact, is there evidence
of any change at all

528
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:06,903
in the symbiont since it joined
with its new host?

529
00:29:06,948 --> 00:29:07,938
Yes or no.

530
00:29:16,365 --> 00:29:17,594
No.

531
00:29:17,634 --> 00:29:19,398
Thank you, Dr. Bashir.

532
00:29:19,437 --> 00:29:21,498
You've been very helpful.

533
00:29:31,225 --> 00:29:34,857
Any more witnesses,
Commander Sisko?

534
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,526
Yes, Madam Arbiter.

535
00:29:36,568 --> 00:29:39,802
I'd like to call
the one person in this courtroom

536
00:29:39,841 --> 00:29:41,207
who knew Curzon Dax.

537
00:29:41,243 --> 00:29:42,370
Me.

538
00:29:42,412 --> 00:29:45,782
You know where
the witness stand is.

539
00:29:50,092 --> 00:29:51,720
With your permission

540
00:29:51,762 --> 00:29:54,858
I'd like Major Kira
to direct the questions.

541
00:30:02,448 --> 00:30:05,909
Tell us a little
about Curzon Dax, Commander.

542
00:30:05,954 --> 00:30:08,584
He probably wasn't
the ideal Trill.

543
00:30:08,626 --> 00:30:11,153
He drank a little too much.

544
00:30:11,197 --> 00:30:12,927
He could be more interested
in women

545
00:30:12,966 --> 00:30:14,491
than maybe he should have been.

546
00:30:14,536 --> 00:30:16,266
I thought he was your friend.

547
00:30:16,306 --> 00:30:18,833
I'm simply pointing out
that he was not at all

548
00:30:18,877 --> 00:30:20,870
like the young woman
in this courtroom.

549
00:30:23,151 --> 00:30:25,951
What was, exactly,
your relationship

550
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,983
with Curzon Dax?

551
00:30:28,027 --> 00:30:30,759
He took a raw, young ensign
under his wing

552
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:32,961
and taught me to appreciate life

553
00:30:33,002 --> 00:30:35,632
in ways
I'd never thought about before.

554
00:30:35,674 --> 00:30:40,479
He taught me about art
and science and diplomacy.

555
00:30:40,516 --> 00:30:43,316
Whatever sense of honor
I might have today

556
00:30:43,355 --> 00:30:45,085
he nurtured.

557
00:30:45,125 --> 00:30:50,567
Treason, murder... he was
not capable of those things.

558
00:30:50,601 --> 00:30:51,864
As you've already said

559
00:30:51,903 --> 00:30:54,100
Commander,
this is not a trial.

560
00:30:54,141 --> 00:30:56,771
I'm describing my friend,
Curzon Dax...

561
00:30:56,812 --> 00:30:58,714
a man I knew very well.

562
00:30:58,749 --> 00:31:02,449
On the other hand,
I can't tell you too much

563
00:31:02,489 --> 00:31:04,516
about my new friend there.

564
00:31:04,627 --> 00:31:08,225
We're really just getting
to know each other.

565
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:14,141
Commander, Starfleet officers
do have the reputation

566
00:31:14,177 --> 00:31:15,805
of being honorable

567
00:31:15,846 --> 00:31:18,749
and I judge you to be
an honorable man.

568
00:31:18,785 --> 00:31:21,813
As an honorable man,
do you think this crime

569
00:31:21,857 --> 00:31:23,793
should go unpunished?

570
00:31:23,827 --> 00:31:26,354
I prefer no crime
to go unpunished.

571
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,860
Then, if it were possible,
even you would not argue

572
00:31:29,905 --> 00:31:32,569
with punishing
the symbiont part of Dax.

573
00:31:32,677 --> 00:31:35,443
How can you be so sure
that the symbiont

574
00:31:35,481 --> 00:31:37,347
was the criminal influence?

575
00:31:37,385 --> 00:31:40,983
What if it were the Curzon host
that was responsible?

576
00:31:41,025 --> 00:31:44,964
Then the surviving symbiont
would be completely innocent.

577
00:31:44,999 --> 00:31:47,026
No. They'd both be guilty.

578
00:31:47,069 --> 00:31:51,008
You yourself have argued
that the two personalities

579
00:31:51,043 --> 00:31:53,343
once joined, function as one.

580
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,976
Your own Dr. Bashir
confirmed it.

581
00:31:56,019 --> 00:31:58,489
When you put salt in water

582
00:31:58,523 --> 00:32:02,519
the two become indistinguishable
and inseparable.

583
00:32:02,564 --> 00:32:06,162
I think you've just made
my point for me.

584
00:32:06,204 --> 00:32:08,002
When the water boils off

585
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,977
the salt returns
to its original state.

586
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:13,882
Pour that same salt
into another liquid

587
00:32:13,917 --> 00:32:17,185
and you have something
completely different.

588
00:32:17,224 --> 00:32:19,022
Jadzia Dax
is an entirely new entity.

589
00:32:20,062 --> 00:32:22,760
Following a one-hour recess

590
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:27,035
Lieutenant Dax will take
the witness stand.

591
00:32:27,074 --> 00:32:28,906
One hour.

592
00:32:42,436 --> 00:32:46,603
If you won't defend yourself,
you're not going to testify.

593
00:32:46,643 --> 00:32:49,637
It's a hearing, not a trial.

594
00:32:49,716 --> 00:32:51,207
She has no choice.

595
00:33:00,868 --> 00:33:01,961
Sir.

596
00:33:03,707 --> 00:33:05,700
Odo's on subspace.

597
00:33:05,744 --> 00:33:06,973
It's urgent.

598
00:33:11,126 --> 00:33:12,617
I've made some progress.

599
00:33:12,662 --> 00:33:13,630
Good.

600
00:33:13,664 --> 00:33:14,962
Not good.

601
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,461
Since the transmission to
the enemy is the key evidence

602
00:33:18,506 --> 00:33:20,476
I thought it might be
a good idea

603
00:33:20,509 --> 00:33:22,445
to go through
all the communications logs

604
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,450
from headquarters
during that period.

605
00:33:24,483 --> 00:33:26,976
I even found
Curzon Dax's records.

606
00:33:27,021 --> 00:33:28,489
You can't tell me Curzon

607
00:33:28,524 --> 00:33:30,926
would log in a communiqué
to the enemy.

608
00:33:30,961 --> 00:33:32,224
No, nothing like that

609
00:33:32,298 --> 00:33:35,532
but the log does show
a number of conversations

610
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:38,838
between Dax's office
and General Tandro's home.

611
00:33:38,876 --> 00:33:40,105
They were close friends.

612
00:33:40,145 --> 00:33:41,704
A number of the conversations

613
00:33:41,747 --> 00:33:44,616
took place while the General
was away at the front.

614
00:33:47,157 --> 00:33:50,026
- The wife.
- The wife.

615
00:33:52,834 --> 00:33:56,000
Curzon Dax and Enina Tandro.

616
00:33:57,075 --> 00:33:58,270
Maybe it was innocent.

617
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:01,281
Maybe he was just providing
a little emotional support

618
00:34:01,316 --> 00:34:02,375
during tough times.

619
00:34:02,418 --> 00:34:04,752
Or maybe they were
taking advantage

620
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:08,091
of the General's absence
to get a little closer.

621
00:34:08,128 --> 00:34:10,360
If they were having an affair

622
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:14,600
that translates into a pretty
solid motive for murder.

623
00:34:24,959 --> 00:34:27,486
The conversations
were just the beginning.

624
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,260
I've also found records of gifts

625
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,271
of holidays spent at an inn
outside the capital.

626
00:34:32,306 --> 00:34:33,797
Oh. What purpose
does this serve?

627
00:34:33,841 --> 00:34:35,036
It serves the truth.

628
00:34:35,077 --> 00:34:36,375
Oh, the truth.

629
00:34:36,413 --> 00:34:38,006
If there's more to this
than meets the eye

630
00:34:38,049 --> 00:34:39,951
I hope you'll explain,
because as it stands

631
00:34:39,986 --> 00:34:42,786
this will severely hurt
Dax's defense.

632
00:34:46,431 --> 00:34:49,665
My husband was not the hero
in life

633
00:34:49,703 --> 00:34:52,606
that he was in death, Mr. Odo.

634
00:34:52,642 --> 00:34:54,942
In death, he became a legend

635
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:57,280
and I became a legend's wife.

636
00:34:57,317 --> 00:35:00,413
There are people who did not
even know my husband

637
00:35:00,456 --> 00:35:01,924
who still contact me.

638
00:35:01,958 --> 00:35:04,952
Decades after his death,
they still mourn him.

639
00:35:04,998 --> 00:35:05,966
But you don't.

640
00:35:05,999 --> 00:35:07,228
No

641
00:35:07,268 --> 00:35:10,434
because I knew the man
before he became a legend.

642
00:35:10,474 --> 00:35:12,808
But I also know
my place in history.

643
00:35:12,845 --> 00:35:16,113
My place is to carry on
bravely, never to remarry...

644
00:35:16,151 --> 00:35:18,553
to represent my husband
at the banquets

645
00:35:18,589 --> 00:35:19,887
given in his name.

646
00:35:19,924 --> 00:35:23,294
But never, never to talk
about who he really was.

647
00:35:23,363 --> 00:35:27,861
Because nobody
wants to hear that.

648
00:35:27,905 --> 00:35:29,966
They may have to hear it now.

649
00:35:30,009 --> 00:35:31,477
No matter what is said

650
00:35:31,512 --> 00:35:36,010
they will still embrace
his memory...

651
00:35:39,025 --> 00:35:44,433
for he was and always will be

652
00:35:44,468 --> 00:35:48,134
the hero
who died for his people.

653
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,349
But perhaps it's time

654
00:35:54,453 --> 00:35:57,619
for my place in history
to change.

655
00:36:04,671 --> 00:36:07,471
You've been protecting
her reputation.

656
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:10,140
That's it, isn't it?

657
00:36:10,181 --> 00:36:12,515
That's why you won't
even defend yourself.

658
00:36:17,862 --> 00:36:22,063
There are worse things
than an illicit love affair.

659
00:36:22,102 --> 00:36:24,538
Curzon didn't murder anybody.

660
00:36:24,573 --> 00:36:26,736
He didn't commit treason.

661
00:36:26,778 --> 00:36:29,180
Are you really willing
to commit suicide

662
00:36:29,215 --> 00:36:31,651
over something done
in another lifetime?

663
00:36:31,686 --> 00:36:33,883
That is what you're doing,
you know.

664
00:36:37,898 --> 00:36:39,628
My God, Dax.

665
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:42,467
Young Tandro...
that wouldn't be your son?

666
00:36:42,506 --> 00:36:45,306
You have an overactive
imagination, Benjamin.

667
00:36:45,344 --> 00:36:47,473
Then what is it
that's holding you back?

668
00:36:47,515 --> 00:36:48,505
Help me.

669
00:36:51,189 --> 00:36:54,525
Damn it, if you were
still a man...

670
00:36:59,203 --> 00:37:01,173
I see your temper
hasn't improved.

671
00:37:01,207 --> 00:37:03,507
Don't talk to me
about my temper.

672
00:37:03,543 --> 00:37:05,171
Curzon always
warned you about it.

673
00:37:05,214 --> 00:37:08,117
You're not going
to get me off track here.

674
00:37:08,152 --> 00:37:11,454
Do you remember
that Argosian Lieutenant

675
00:37:11,492 --> 00:37:14,156
who threw a drink in your face?

676
00:37:19,405 --> 00:37:22,308
And you knocked me down
with a right cross

677
00:37:22,344 --> 00:37:24,040
before I could kill him.

678
00:37:24,081 --> 00:37:27,576
I still have a little scar here
from your ring finger.

679
00:37:29,357 --> 00:37:36,565
I tried on that ring
after Curzon died.

680
00:37:36,603 --> 00:37:39,403
It just slipped off my finger.

681
00:37:41,379 --> 00:37:46,184
If you don't help me, old man,
they're going to take you

682
00:37:46,221 --> 00:37:49,056
because I don't know
any more arguments.

683
00:37:50,895 --> 00:37:52,693
Then allow it to happen.

684
00:37:52,732 --> 00:37:55,760
It is my obligation
to protect the lives

685
00:37:55,804 --> 00:37:57,568
of those in my command.

686
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,167
You ought to know that,
you taught it to me.

687
00:38:00,913 --> 00:38:03,076
That was Curzon.

688
00:38:03,117 --> 00:38:04,983
I'll stop trying to protect you

689
00:38:05,021 --> 00:38:07,389
the minute you tell me
Curzon was guilty

690
00:38:07,492 --> 00:38:08,551
of these charges.

691
00:38:08,594 --> 00:38:10,358
I won't discuss it with you.

692
00:38:10,397 --> 00:38:12,629
As for Enina Tandro

693
00:38:12,668 --> 00:38:18,235
yes, I feel the shame
of Curzon's indiscretion.

694
00:38:18,278 --> 00:38:21,580
When one of my kind
stumbles, Benjamin

695
00:38:21,618 --> 00:38:24,088
it is a mistake
that's there forever.

696
00:38:24,122 --> 00:38:27,184
I can't tell you
which part of Curzon Dax

697
00:38:27,227 --> 00:38:30,529
couldn't stop himself
from acting shamefully

698
00:38:30,567 --> 00:38:32,433
with another man's wife.

699
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:38,607
I can tell you...
that he did love her

700
00:38:38,648 --> 00:38:40,777
for whatever that's worth.

701
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,186
Enough to kill her husband?

702
00:38:44,925 --> 00:38:46,861
So you are questioning?

703
00:38:46,896 --> 00:38:50,130
What else can I do?

704
00:38:51,438 --> 00:38:53,908
Nothing, Benjamin.

705
00:38:53,942 --> 00:38:55,878
Nothing at all.

706
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:16,078
Lieutenant Dax, you are either
200 years older than I am

707
00:39:16,115 --> 00:39:20,179
or you're about the same age
as my great-granddaughter.

708
00:39:20,223 --> 00:39:23,126
At first, I wondered
which of those you were.

709
00:39:23,161 --> 00:39:26,327
Now, I am bothered
by the likelihood

710
00:39:26,367 --> 00:39:28,303
that you may be both.

711
00:39:30,241 --> 00:39:33,007
Let's finish this, Commander.

712
00:39:34,548 --> 00:39:36,814
At what age did the host,
Jadzia

713
00:39:36,853 --> 00:39:39,323
first want to be joined
as a Trill?

714
00:39:39,357 --> 00:39:41,657
I wanted it since I was a child.

715
00:39:41,695 --> 00:39:43,129
I worked very hard for it.

716
00:39:43,164 --> 00:39:46,330
The competition to become
a Trill is very strong, then

717
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:47,668
among potential hosts?

718
00:39:47,706 --> 00:39:50,404
Yes. It's considered
a great honor.

719
00:39:50,444 --> 00:39:53,506
How did the young Jadzia finally
become a host candidate?

720
00:39:53,582 --> 00:39:55,278
By winning scholarships

721
00:39:55,319 --> 00:39:57,687
competing against
other young people.

722
00:39:57,724 --> 00:39:59,522
You're tested in countless ways.

723
00:39:59,627 --> 00:40:00,925
Including psychological tests

724
00:40:00,962 --> 00:40:02,521
to determine strength
of character

725
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,330
of the prospective host,
is that true?

726
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:05,359
Yes.

727
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:06,441
And the young Jadzia

728
00:40:06,574 --> 00:40:11,015
excelled in those tests
of academics and character...

729
00:40:11,048 --> 00:40:13,314
of psychological stability.

730
00:40:13,353 --> 00:40:15,482
Yes.

731
00:40:15,524 --> 00:40:21,023
If you can remember other
things, remember that as well.

732
00:40:21,066 --> 00:40:26,873
What academic degrees
do you hold, Lieutenant?

733
00:40:26,911 --> 00:40:32,376
I hold Premier Distinctions
in exobiology, zoology

734
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:36,052
astrophysics and exoarchaeology.

735
00:40:36,093 --> 00:40:37,959
How many of those degrees
did you earn

736
00:40:37,997 --> 00:40:40,229
before being joined
with the symbiont Dax?

737
00:40:40,268 --> 00:40:42,568
All of them.

738
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:47,013
All of them.
As Jadzia.

739
00:40:47,047 --> 00:40:48,276
Alone.

740
00:40:50,887 --> 00:40:54,018
This brilliant and independent
young woman

741
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:58,124
has done nothing in her life
but contribute to her society.

742
00:40:58,167 --> 00:40:59,362
Madam Arbiter

743
00:40:59,402 --> 00:41:01,599
how can anyone justify
trying her for a crime

744
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,438
allegedly committed
by another entity

745
00:41:03,476 --> 00:41:05,446
before she was even born?

746
00:41:08,085 --> 00:41:10,749
This will only take a minute.

747
00:41:11,925 --> 00:41:13,895
Lieutenant...

748
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:15,227
as a Trill candidate

749
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:18,634
did Jadzia fully understand
the responsibilities

750
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:21,402
to be assumed
upon becoming a Trill

751
00:41:21,442 --> 00:41:23,206
and did you willingly
accept those responsibilities

752
00:41:23,245 --> 00:41:25,807
and whatever consequences
they might entail?

753
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,580
Yes.

754
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:30,523
And would that not obviously
include the consequences

755
00:41:30,558 --> 00:41:33,358
of criminal acts
committed by Curzon Dax?

756
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:46,684
May I speak?

757
00:41:46,721 --> 00:41:48,485
And you are?

758
00:41:48,524 --> 00:41:51,552
I am Enina Tandro

759
00:41:51,596 --> 00:41:54,898
widow of General Ardelon Tandro.

760
00:41:54,935 --> 00:41:57,405
This hearing is unnecessary.

761
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,306
The accusations are erroneous.

762
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:01,812
Mother, what are you
talking about?

763
00:42:01,848 --> 00:42:06,551
Madam Arbiter,
Curzon Dax is accused

764
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:09,425
of sending a transmission
to the enemy

765
00:42:09,462 --> 00:42:12,764
that betrayed my husband.

766
00:42:12,801 --> 00:42:15,431
But I know where Curzon was

767
00:42:15,473 --> 00:42:18,809
at the exact time
that transmission was sent.

768
00:42:22,485 --> 00:42:26,754
He was... in my bed.

769
00:42:45,527 --> 00:42:47,325
Mr. Tandro

770
00:42:47,363 --> 00:42:51,268
you will want to reexamine
your extradition request.

771
00:42:51,303 --> 00:42:56,142
Until then,
this hearing is adjourned.

772
00:43:08,334 --> 00:43:13,298
It was kind of you
to try and protect me...

773
00:43:13,343 --> 00:43:15,813
someone you'd never even met.

774
00:43:15,848 --> 00:43:19,480
There's much of Curzon
that's still a part of me...

775
00:43:19,521 --> 00:43:22,652
that still remembers
what you had together.

776
00:43:22,693 --> 00:43:26,996
But it was Curzon Dax
who swore himself to silence

777
00:43:27,034 --> 00:43:31,498
to preserve the memory
of General Tandro, not Jadzia.

778
00:43:31,543 --> 00:43:34,845
I felt it was important
to keep that promise.

779
00:43:34,882 --> 00:43:39,346
The General's memory
is cherished by your people.

780
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:42,624
And it will continue to be.

781
00:43:42,662 --> 00:43:44,130
Oh, no one will ever know

782
00:43:44,165 --> 00:43:47,626
that he was the one
who tried to betray us

783
00:43:47,671 --> 00:43:50,733
and that the rebels
killed him for the favor.

784
00:43:53,515 --> 00:43:59,322
As for you, there is
one favor I would ask.

785
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,330
Of course.

786
00:44:02,364 --> 00:44:05,199
Live, Jadzia Dax.

787
00:44:13,952 --> 00:44:17,014
Live a long,
fresh and wonderful life.
