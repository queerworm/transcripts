00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:06,381
SISKO:<i> Station Log, Stardate 46910.1.</i>

2
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:08,299
<i>Chief O'Brien has escorted his wife</i>

3
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:11,302
<i>back to Earth to celebrate</i>
<i>her mother's 100th birthday.</i>

4
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:15,640
<i>In the meantime, the rest of us are trying</i>
<i>to keep the station up and running.</i>

5
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:23,273
It's almost as if
the refiltration processors

6
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:26,735
were waiting for Chief O'Brien to leave
before breaking down.

7
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:29,738
This technology looks like
something the Cardassians

8
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,990
must have taken from the Romulans.

9
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:34,701
Is that an RCL type-1 matrix field?

10
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:37,537
Perhaps we should call in
a Romulan repair service.

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,247
Or an RCL type-2?

12
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,333
Another raktajino?

13
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,127
It'll keep me up all night.

14
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,921
I can think of better ways
of keeping you up

15
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:50,008
and they're more fun than
drinking Klingon coffee.

16
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,469
Definitely type-1.

17
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,158
Dax.

18
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,705
I really should be getting to bed.

19
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:23,833
May I escort you to your quarters?

20
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,752
That's not necessary, Julian.

21
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,170
Oh.

22
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,755
Well, good night, then.

23
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:46,731
"Not necessary, Julian."

24
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,320
But not forbidden, either.

25
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,164
Dax.

26
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,250
Yes.

27
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:07,794
You are Dax?

28
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,295
What do you want?

29
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,179
( muffled cry )

30
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,472
Dax!

31
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,797
Yes, Major?

32
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,424
I'm just not sure, Commander.

33
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,551
{\an8}What does it look like to you?

34
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,971
{\an8}It looks like a residual charge
in the graviton generator.

35
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:07,390
{\an8}If that's what it is, it will bleed off.

36
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,059
{\an8}Let's run a quick level-3 diagnostic,
just to be sure.

37
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,358
{\an8}-Bashir to Ops.
-Ops.

38
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:21,821
{\an8}Three people...
I think they just took Jadzia.

39
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,950
{\an8}<i>She tried to struggle with them,</i>
<i>and I tried to help, but...</i>

40
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,535
{\an8}Full station security alert.

41
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,163
{\an8}Secure all turbolifts.

42
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,206
{\an8}Seal off airlocks
on levels four through 12.

43
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,208
{\an8}Computer, locate Lieutenant Dax.

44
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:37,128
{\an8}<i>Lieutenant Dax is on level six,</i>
<i>corridor one.</i>

45
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,755
{\an8}BASHIR: <i>No, that's where I am.</i>

46
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:42,175
-They just left her comm badge.
-How long ago, Doctor?

47
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,885
Oh, I'm not sure, really.

48
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,137
DAX: What are you doing?

49
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,558
We turn right at the next corridor.

50
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,486
They're managing to avoid
the security tracking grid.

51
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,988
{\an8}They seem to know a lot about the station.

52
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,740
{\an8}Then they may know
the speed of our runabouts.

53
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,785
If they do, they probably have
a faster ship to make their escape.

54
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:12,038
Major, survey all ships in dock
with a high warp capability.

55
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,670
-Damn!
-What?

56
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:23,049
That's why we've got a residual charge
in the graviton generator.

57
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,592
They've disabled the tractor beam.

58
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:27,804
We've got eight ships in dock
capable of warp five or more.

59
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,890
Three on docking pylons,
five smaller ones in the ports.

60
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,600
Seal off all docking ring airlocks.

61
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:35,186
Security, all duty squads
to the docking ring.

62
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:38,272
Commence immediate inward sweep,
levels 16 through 21.

63
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,698
( beeping )

64
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,167
I've got them-- Airlock 5.

65
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,418
ODO: I'm on my way.

66
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,462
Security, report to airlock,
corridor five.

67
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,172
We have a hostage situation.

68
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,216
Isolating with cadderon force fields.

69
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,720
Will you just tell me what you want?

70
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,445
Move.

71
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:31,826
( console beeping )

72
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,703
Force field is down.

73
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,664
They know the security override codes.

74
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,666
They're boarding a ship.

75
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,668
I'm trying to speed up
the bleed-off process

76
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,753
-in the graviton generator.
-( beeping )

77
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,130
We lost them.

78
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,305
It's working.

79
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,974
I'm increasing the flow
to the EPS wave guides.

80
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:57,685
The excess charge is neutralizing.

81
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,145
Engage tractor beam.

82
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,695
Gotcha.

83
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,908
Bring it in to Docking Port 6, Major.

84
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,544
Slowly!

85
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,048
Extremities where I can see them.

86
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,467
You're the Chief of Security?

87
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,974
Are you all right?

88
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,937
My name is Ilon Tandro,

89
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,939
special envoy from Klaestron IV,

90
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,274
in charge of this extradition procedure.

91
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,818
Extradition?
I call this kidnapping and assault.

92
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,738
You'll find that to be
a valid warrant for her arrest.

93
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,533
The relevant treaty
between Klaestron IV and your Federation

94
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,409
allows for unilateral extradition.

95
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,494
And the charge?

96
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,748
The fugitive Dax
is charged with treason...

97
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,918
and the murder of my father.

98
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,644
The warrant says Dax was responsible

99
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,146
for the death of General Ardelon Tandro

100
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,523
30 years ago.

101
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,233
Thirty years ago?

102
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,985
That would have been Curzon Dax.

103
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:32,655
Mmm, when he was on Klaestron IV

104
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:36,325
as a Federation mediator
during their civil war.

105
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,203
He never mentioned
he'd even been to Klaestron IV.

106
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,329
Strange.

107
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,374
Not so strange, considering these charges.

108
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,626
Odo, let me tell you something.

109
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,754
Curzon Dax tended to be
a little cavalier about life,

110
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:52,008
even about his personal responsibilities
from time to time.

111
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,888
I think that was part of the reason
I liked him so much.

112
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,099
He had more faults

113
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,727
than the usual socially acceptable Trill.

114
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,479
He was not a murderer.

115
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,316
How about a traitor?

116
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,610
It says Dax betrayed
the Klaestron government

117
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:11,861
to the rebels.

118
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,154
It's all nonsense, Constable.

119
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,614
I'm telling you I knew the man.

120
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:19,285
But did you know
the symbiont inside the man?

121
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,081
( door chimes )

122
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:29,378
Come in.

123
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,385
I've sent a subspace message
to Klaestron IV

124
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,387
requesting confirmation of the warrant.

125
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,599
That's the only stall I could think of.

126
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:45,519
Now, what the hell's going on, Dax?

127
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:51,776
Dax. If I'm going to help you,
you've got to help me.

128
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:54,445
I don't expect any help, Benjamin.

129
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:55,738
Thank you, though.

130
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:56,947
Are you crazy?

131
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,492
Treason and murder--

132
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:00,785
on Klaestron IV.

133
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,204
Either of those gets you
the death penalty.

134
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,045
What's the matter with you?

135
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:15,257
Talk to me, before I have
to let these people take you.

136
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:19,303
No. I'm sorry, Benjamin, but no.

137
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:35,069
We've got 18, 20 years
of friendship behind us.

138
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:37,196
I'm Jadzia Dax now.

139
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,324
That was Curzon Dax
you knew for 20 years.

140
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,411
So when the Dax part of you survived
from one host to the next,

141
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,579
it really didn't take
our friendship along.

142
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:51,335
Benjamin, you know
you're still my very dear friend.

143
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,881
I'm sorry.

144
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,263
You've received
your confirmation, Commander.

145
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,890
Now we'd like to be on
our way with the prisoner.

146
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,392
You know, Mr. Tandro,

147
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:09,103
I kept wondering
why you tried to kidnap Lieutenant Dax

148
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:12,064
rather than just present your warrant
to me in the proper way.

149
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,941
I couldn't figure that out at first.

150
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,943
I trust you have figured out, Commander,

151
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,779
that our extradition treaty
with your Federation

152
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,156
is current and valid.

153
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,241
This station is technically Bajoran.

154
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,118
What does that mean to us?

155
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,871
You don't have an extradition treaty
with Bajor.

156
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:30,040
I think that's why you tried
to abduct Lieutenant Dax.

157
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:33,043
You were afraid the Bajorans
would refuse extradition.

158
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,587
That's absurd.

159
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,590
No Bajoran interests
are even involved here.

160
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:40,634
How did you know your way
around this station so well?

161
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,429
My conversation is with the Commander.

162
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:47,016
No, your conversation
is with my first officer now.

163
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,852
You Klaestrons are allies
of the Cardassians.

164
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,812
Your knowledge of this station
confirms that.

165
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,272
They must have given you the layout,

166
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:56,775
which not only compromises
Bajoran security,

167
00:12:56,859 --> 00:13:00,446
but also... annoys us.

168
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:03,616
I'm afraid Bajoran interests
are involved,

169
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,826
and Bajor is adamant that--

170
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,204
At least, I believe it's adamant.

171
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,455
Oh. Oh, yes.

172
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:12,833
You see, there will have
to be an extradition hearing

173
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,127
before I can lawfully
release Lieutenant Dax.

174
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,843
For how long?

175
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,720
As long as it takes.

176
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,472
That could be for days.

177
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,891
Well, there's nowhere else
on the station that's suitable.

178
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,185
That's too bad.

179
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,479
I'm not shutting down
for any Bajoran hearing.

180
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:36,315
I'm sure Lieutenant Dax
would appreciate it.

181
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,238
Business is business.

182
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,697
Ah.

183
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:51,497
You know, that wall's going to have
to come in about five meters.

184
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,123
What are you talking about?

185
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,793
Of course, after you move the wall,

186
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:59,421
that'll mean your second-level holosuites
will have to come down.

187
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,590
Come down? Why?

188
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,968
New restrictions.

189
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,553
Restrictions?

190
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,388
Building codes.

191
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,640
Since the provisional
government took over,

192
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,225
they've got their hands into everything

193
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:16,522
and, of course, I'm the one who's expected
to enforce their rules here.

194
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,191
Ha.

195
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:26,615
You know, I think this bar
is just a little too near the exit.

196
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:32,621
-This is blackmail.
-No, it's just business.

197
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,960
And business is business.

198
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,681
I was just coming to see you.

199
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:53,183
We still haven't found
a place for the hearing.

200
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,853
Holding it on Bajor would involve
Dax leaving the station,

201
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,062
and I don't want to risk that.

202
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,480
Well, now that's a coincidence.

203
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:02,067
Our good friend Quark just donated the use
of his facility for the hearing.

204
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,653
-Nice gesture.
-I thought so.

205
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:08,699
You know, I haven't been able to get
a word out of Dax about any of this.

206
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:11,118
So I thought someone
might go do some investigating

207
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,661
on Klaestron IV itself.

208
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,871
What do you think?

209
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,540
This case has 30 years
of dust covering it.

210
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,043
The extradition hearing
will take about 30 minutes.

211
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,754
I was hoping to make it
a little longer than that.

212
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,297
Good luck.

213
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,151
This will be an informal hearing

214
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:47,237
so I'm going to start
with some informal advice.

215
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,864
I am 100 years old.

216
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:53,160
I do not have time to squander
listening to superfluous language.

217
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:56,580
In short,
I intend being here until supper,

218
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,582
not senility.

219
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,750
Understood?

220
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,795
Understood, Madam Arbiter.

221
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,468
You seek the extradition. Make your case.

222
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:14,682
The accused Trill, whatever
its present appearance may be,

223
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,601
was and is a Federation officer

224
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,937
who committed capital crimes
on our planet.

225
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,524
Since there is no time limit
on the prosecution of such crimes...

226
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:27,528
Thank you, I have already read
the warrant and the charges.

227
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:31,782
The crimes described are 30 years old.

228
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,117
What took you so long?

229
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,369
The evidence was contained
in military files

230
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:38,122
which were officially sealed
until recently.

231
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,623
Fine. Sit.

232
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,005
Commander, the warrant is in order.

233
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:49,425
On what grounds do you ask
that I deny extradition?

234
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,427
You say the warrant's in order,

235
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,637
but the name on the warrant is Dax.

236
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:57,224
Certainly that doesn't refer
to Jadzia Dax, a female,

237
00:16:57,307 --> 00:17:00,394
but to the now deceased Curzon Dax,
a male.

238
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:03,230
This young woman wasn't
even born 30 years ago.

239
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,774
You are arguing semantics.

240
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,235
This creature is a Trill.

241
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,947
The symbiont known as Dax
has progressed from one host to the next.

242
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,116
Exactly. From one host to the next.

243
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,826
A different host, a different person.

244
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,995
So I submit that the person
he wants to extradite

245
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,496
no longer exists,

246
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,290
and I challenge him to prove otherwise.

247
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,250
That's ridiculous.

248
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,627
It would have been easier on me,
Commander,

249
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,422
had you not raised that particular point,

250
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,968
but the penalty for these crimes
on your planet is death,

251
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,970
and that is rather permanent,

252
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,222
so before I grant extradition,

253
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,099
you will convince me, please,

254
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:44,229
that the person named in your warrant
is the person who is standing here now.

255
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:06,460
She doesn't seem to care
whether she gets out of this or not.

256
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:08,045
I care.

257
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,255
Doctor, we've given the opposition

258
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,466
access to our computers
and station library,

259
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,468
so let's utilize them ourselves.

260
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:17,054
I want you to find
all the medical evidence you can

261
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,598
to support the theory that
Jadzia Dax and Curzon Dax

262
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,642
are two entirely separate people.

263
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,519
-Major...
-Excuse me, sir.

264
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,563
I don't know that there is
any medical evidence on that.

265
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,607
Assume there is, then find it.

266
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,652
Major, I'm not asking you
to be an attorney here,

267
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,654
but if you could check
the Federation computers

268
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,030
for any precedents,

269
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,990
legal decisions involving Trills.

270
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,284
Is a Trill responsible for the conduct...

271
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,372
for the acts... of its antecedent selves?

272
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,290
Right, that kind of thing.

273
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,167
What if I find the answer is "yes"?

274
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,086
Then that answer is wrong.

275
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:52,256
From this minute on, our answer is "no."

276
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,679
But if you do find a wrong answer...

277
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,973
I want to see it.

278
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:02,724
I can't fight what I don't know about.

279
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:03,809
( beep )

280
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:06,270
CREWMAN: <i>Commander Sisko,</i>
<i>there's a subspace communication</i>

281
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,355
<i>from Odo on Klaestron IV.</i>

282
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,065
We only have a few hours, people.

283
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,698
What have you got for us, Constable?

284
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,908
{\an8}<i>Well, I know two things so far.</i>

285
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,495
{\an8}<i>Whoever did murder</i>
<i>that General Ardelon Tandro,</i>

286
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,289
{\an8}<i>it got his troops so mad,</i>

287
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,708
{\an8}<i>they went out and won their civil war.</i>

288
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,960
{\an8}<i>They made the general a national hero.</i>

289
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:32,963
{\an8}<i>There are statues of him</i>
<i>all over the place.</i>

290
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,716
{\an8}<i>The second...</i>
<i>Everyone that's old enough to remember</i>

291
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:39,386
{\an8}<i>says the General and Curzon Dax</i>
<i>were the closest of friends...</i>

292
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,888
{\an8}<i>comrades, inseparable.</i>

293
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,932
{\an8}Now that sounds
like the Curzon Dax I knew.

294
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,392
{\an8}<i>But treason,</i>

295
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,811
{\an8}<i>plus the murder of his own best friend?</i>

296
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,313
{\an8}<i>Strange business.</i>

297
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,814
{\an8}<i>If those charges are true,</i>

298
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:54,359
{\an8}<i>I'd want to hang Curzon Dax up</i>
<i>by his heels myself.</i>

299
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,153
{\an8}Thanks for the confidence.

300
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,363
{\an8}<i>Don't worry. I'll do my job.</i>

301
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,990
{\an8}<i>The General left a widow.</i>

302
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,117
{\an8}<i>If the two men were that close,</i>

303
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,745
{\an8}<i>she has to remember something</i>
<i>about Curzon Dax</i>

304
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,330
{\an8}<i>that's not in the record.</i>

305
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,956
{\an8}<i>You'll hear from me.</i>

306
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:21,762
Curzon Dax was not responsible
for the death of my husband.

307
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:24,765
-You're certain of that?
-Without a doubt.

308
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,017
But your own son...

309
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:32,356
My son is obsessed
with the death of a father he never knew.

310
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,235
Oh, I tried to persuade him
not to reopen the case.

311
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:39,738
He won't listen to anyone,
least of all to me.

312
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,615
You have to understand,

313
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:46,954
Curzon Dax was closer to the General
than any other man on this planet.

314
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,790
He was a dear friend to this family.

315
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:54,461
Curzon would have died himself
sooner than conspire against my husband.

316
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,296
Is that a personal opinion,

317
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,423
or are there any facts
that would support this?

318
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:02,094
The only facts I have
are in my son's hands,

319
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:04,930
and he intends to use them against Dax.

320
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:07,391
It might help my people
to know what they are.

321
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:12,729
There is proof of a secret transmission

322
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,856
that was made
from our military headquarters

323
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,400
to the enemy camp.

324
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:20,904
It identifies exactly the route
my husband was taking

325
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,907
on his way back from
the capital to the front.

326
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:27,869
It was at that time
that he was ambushed and kidnapped.

327
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,038
A short time later, he was killed.

328
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:35,252
Then your son must believe
that Dax made the transmission.

329
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:38,714
There were only five people,
including my husband

330
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,424
who knew that route.

331
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:44,011
My son has established
the whereabouts of all of them

332
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,637
at the time of the transmission.

333
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,015
All of them except Curzon.

334
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:52,144
So Dax has no alibi.

335
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:57,607
That cannot possibly be
enough to convict him.

336
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,443
Can it?

337
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,320
I don't know.

338
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,199
Thank you. You've been helpful.

339
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,206
How is he?

340
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,417
Ma'am?

341
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,170
Curzon Dax.

342
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,465
He's gone.

343
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:25,135
The Dax your son is trying to extradite

344
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,595
is Jadzia Dax,

345
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,722
a 28-year-old woman.

346
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:31,433
Curzon Dax died two years ago.

347
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,769
Jadzia is the new host.

348
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,524
I'm sorry.

349
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,402
I didn't know.

350
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,293
TANDRO: Madam Arbiter,
I call on the expert knowledge

351
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:00,420
of another Trill, Selin Peers.

352
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,885
Minister Peers,
we're fortunate to have you with us.

353
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:10,680
Excuse me, it also seems rather convenient
to have you with us.

354
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:11,848
How do you come here?

355
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,517
Because another Trill is involved,

356
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,978
the Trillian government requested
that I be present during the extradition.

357
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,356
And do you know the accused personally?

358
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:21,942
I do not.

359
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:24,236
We accept you as an expert on Trills.

360
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,237
Proceed.

361
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,822
Minister,

362
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:30,325
through how many hosts have you survived?

363
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,828
The symbiont within me has survived

364
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,664
through the adult lifetimes
of seven hosts.

365
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:38,125
Do you remember your very first host?

366
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,709
Of course.

367
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:43,046
It was a woman, as a matter of fact.

368
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:47,050
Do you remember
what you thought and felt

369
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,761
when you were joined with your first host?

370
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:54,349
Yes. The symbiont does carry memories
of time shared with previous hosts.

371
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:56,768
So, if a crime is committed by a Trill,

372
00:23:56,852 --> 00:24:00,230
then the symbiont's next host
would remain aware of it,

373
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:02,691
would recall that crime.

374
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,985
Yes. Absolutely.

375
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,154
Would recall the details of it.

376
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,531
Yes, absolutely.

377
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:12,701
And would still feel the guilt of it.

378
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:13,994
Oh, yes.

379
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:15,996
Madam Arbiter, this is not a trial,

380
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,622
and Mr. Tandro is not the prosecutor.

381
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,041
Mr. Tandro, you have made your point.

382
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,461
I don't believe that I have,
Madam Arbiter.

383
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,131
The real point is that Commander Sisko

384
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:30,385
would have you endorse his idea
of a perfect Trill crime.

385
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:31,928
To commit it, all one has to do

386
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,431
is elude capture long enough
to change hosts,

387
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:38,018
and then he or she can go free.

388
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:44,316
Minister Peers, you've said
you were with your first host

389
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:47,444
-throughout her adult life.
-Yes.

390
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:51,489
So, before a symbiont
is joined with any host

391
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:54,784
that host has lived
a significant portion of his or her life

392
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,870
from birth to what age, sir?

393
00:24:56,953 --> 00:25:00,332
-Early to mid-20s.
-Why not younger?

394
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:05,712
To give the prospective host
a chance to develop, mature.

395
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:08,965
They have to be old enough
to make an informed judgment

396
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:12,177
as to whether or not
they really want to be joined.

397
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,470
And once they are joined,

398
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:17,557
this host's personality
is completely suppressed by the symbiont.

399
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:21,978
Oh, no. No, it's a joining.

400
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,105
It's a total sharing,

401
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,901
a blending of both symbiont and host.

402
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:30,570
Neither is suppressed by the other.

403
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,113
So with each new host,

404
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:35,200
there does come, in fact,
a new personality...

405
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:38,453
a new combined person...
a different person.

406
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:40,413
From that standpoint, yes.

407
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:43,750
Well, I, for one, don't know
from what other standpoint

408
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,168
we could be talking about.

409
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:46,294
Thank you, Minister.

410
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:50,048
Just to return us
to what's important here, Madam Arbiter,

411
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:54,928
the accused can remember
any crime she committed as Curzon Dax,

412
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:59,224
and nothing can be truthfully asserted
in this hearing that can alter that fact.

413
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:02,185
Yes. The memories were passed
to an entirely new host,

414
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,020
to an entirely different person.

415
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,105
This is outrageous!

416
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:08,024
You-- You can't let Dax
get away with murder!

417
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,861
Gentlemen, I said this would be
an informal hearing,

418
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:14,239
not riotous.

419
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:17,033
We will take a two-hour recess.

420
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,381
ARBITER: The answer seems
simple enough to me...

421
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:33,008
split her down the middle.

422
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:37,971
Send the symbiont back to stand trial,
and keep the host here.

423
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:40,515
I'm afraid it's a bit more
complicated than that.

424
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,392
Oh, what a surprise.

425
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,477
Please enlighten me.

426
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,690
The symbiont and the host
are biologically interdependent.

427
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:52,819
93 hours after they've joined,
neither can survive without the other.

428
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:54,612
I see.

429
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:58,325
Proceed, Commander.

430
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:01,328
Doctor, you've heard the arguments.

431
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,580
From a medical point of view,

432
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:07,083
are Curzon Dax and Jadzia Dax
the same person?

433
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,044
Certainly not.

434
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,713
Aside from the gender change,
there's a marked difference

435
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,716
in blood types, metabolism,
nervous system,

436
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,967
height, weight.

437
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,302
This is not at all relevant.

438
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:20,305
What is relevant, sir...

439
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:25,060
is my analysis of the brain waves
of Curzon and Jadzia Dax.

440
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,062
Madam Arbiter.

441
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:30,899
BASHIR: As you can see,
they are distinctly different,

442
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:34,152
which clearly illustrates
that Curzon and Jadzia

443
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,821
are two unique individuals.

444
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,492
Thank you, Doctor.

445
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:44,537
Doctor...

446
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:48,666
I've looked through your research myself.

447
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,710
It's quite impressive
for such a young man.

448
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:52,712
Thank you.

449
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:56,966
As a layman, there are obviously things
I don't fully understand.

450
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,427
I'd be happy to explain anything you wish.

451
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,845
Yes?

452
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:06,684
Well, exactly how does
the Trill brain work?

453
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:09,187
It's quite complicated, actually.

454
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,606
First of all,
there are two cerebral nuclei...

455
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:13,024
Two?

456
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,318
One in the symbiont and one in the host.

457
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:16,694
Two brains.

458
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:19,656
And these two brains talk to each other?

459
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:21,491
Like two computers linked together.

460
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:24,285
That's very clear, Doctor. Thank you.

461
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,705
Now, in your investigations,

462
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:31,876
were you able to analyze the...

463
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,796
separate wave patterns
from each of these brains?

464
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:38,299
They don't function separately.

465
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,719
I didn't ask you how they function,
Dr. Bashir.

466
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:45,181
I asked if you could analyze
the two distinct patterns.

467
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,642
-I don't see the relevance--
-Could you?

468
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:48,852
Yes.

469
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:51,896
And have the brain wave patterns
of the symbiont changed

470
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,773
since it joined with its new host?

471
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,860
With the available evidence,
there's no way of telling.

472
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,278
What's your best guess?

473
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:00,655
I wouldn't care to guess.

474
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,908
In fact, is there evidence
of any change at all

475
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,035
in the symbiont since it joined
with its new host?

476
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,454
Yes or no.

477
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:17,297
No.

478
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:19,549
Thank you, Dr. Bashir.

479
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:21,050
You've been very helpful.

480
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:34,564
Any more witnesses, Commander Sisko?

481
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:36,399
Yes, Madam Arbiter.

482
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,152
I'd like to call the one person
in this courtroom

483
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:41,863
who knew Curzon Dax. Me.

484
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:46,326
You know where the witness stand is.

485
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,873
With your permission,

486
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,250
I'd like Major Kira
to direct the questions.

487
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:05,386
Tell us a little
about Curzon Dax, Commander.

488
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,223
He probably wasn't the ideal Trill.

489
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:11,017
He drank a little too much.

490
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,978
He could be more interested in women
than maybe he should have been.

491
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,814
I thought he was your friend.

492
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:18,608
I'm simply pointing out
that he was not at all

493
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:20,318
like the young woman in this courtroom.

494
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:27,450
What was, exactly, your relationship
with Curzon Dax?

495
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:30,787
He took a raw, young ensign under his wing

496
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:35,041
and taught me to appreciate life
in ways I'd never thought about before.

497
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:39,921
He taught me about art,
and science, and diplomacy.

498
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,841
Whatever sense of honor
I might have today,

499
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,551
he nurtured.

500
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,803
Treason, murder...

501
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,139
He was not capable of those things.

502
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:53,560
As you've already said Commander,
this is not a trial.

503
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:56,229
I'm describing my friend, Curzon Dax...

504
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:58,314
A man I knew very well.

505
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,526
On the other hand,
I can't tell you too much

506
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:04,028
about my new friend there.

507
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,698
We're really just getting
to know each other.

508
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:13,663
Commander, Starfleet officers
do have the reputation

509
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:15,331
of being honorable,

510
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:18,167
and I judge you to be an honorable man.

511
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,004
As an honorable man,

512
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:23,256
do you think this crime
should go unpunished?

513
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:25,758
I prefer no crime to go unpunished.

514
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,595
Then, if it were possible,

515
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:32,098
even you would not argue
with punishing the symbiont part of Dax.

516
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:36,728
How can you be so sure that the symbiont
was the criminal influence?

517
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:41,107
What if it were the Curzon host
that was responsible?

518
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:44,235
Then the surviving symbiont
would be completely innocent.

519
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,488
No. They'd both be guilty.

520
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,909
You yourself have argued
that the two personalities once joined,

521
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,702
function as one.

522
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:55,246
Your own Dr. Bashir confirmed it.

523
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,582
When you put salt in water,

524
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:01,961
the two become
indistinguishable and inseparable.

525
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:05,048
I think you've just made my point for me.

526
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:10,011
When the water boils off,
the salt returns to its original state.

527
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,680
Pour that same salt into another liquid

528
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,350
and you have something
completely different.

529
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:18,311
Jadzia Dax is an entirely new entity.

530
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:19,354
( gavel bangs )

531
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:22,273
Following a one-hour recess,

532
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:26,361
Lieutenant Dax
will take the witness stand.

533
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,404
One hour.

534
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:45,922
If you won't defend yourself,
you're not going to testify.

535
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:49,133
It's a hearing, not a trial.

536
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,510
She has no choice.

537
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:01,813
Sir.

538
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,108
Odo's on subspace.

539
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,442
It's urgent.

540
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:12,407
<i>I've made some progress.</i>

541
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,408
Good.

542
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,743
<i>Not good.</i>

543
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,871
<i>Since the transmission</i>
<i>to the enemy is the key evidence,</i>

544
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,248
<i>I thought it might be a good idea</i>

545
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,291
<i>to go through </i>
<i>all the communications logs</i>

546
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,210
<i>from headquarters during that period.</i>

547
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:27,380
<i>I even found Curzon Dax's records.</i>

548
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:30,758
You can't tell me Curzon
would log in a communiqué to the enemy.

549
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,301
<i>No, nothing like that,</i>

550
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:35,096
<i>but the log does show</i>
<i>a number of conversations</i>

551
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:38,558
<i>between Dax's office</i>
<i>and General Tandro's home.</i>

552
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:39,976
They were close friends.

553
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:44,313
<i>A number of the conversations took place</i>
<i>while the General was away at the front.</i>

554
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:49,819
-The wife.
<i>-The wife.</i>

555
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:55,700
Curzon Dax and Enina Tandro.

556
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,411
<i>Maybe it was innocent.</i>

557
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:00,955
<i>Maybe he was just providing</i>
<i>a little emotional support</i>

558
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,832
<i>during tough times.</i>

559
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:05,209
<i>Or maybe they were taking advantage</i>

560
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,837
<i>of the General's absence</i>
<i>to get a little closer.</i>

561
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:10,339
<i>If they were having an affair,</i>

562
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:14,260
<i>that translates into a pretty</i>
<i>solid motive for murder.</i>

563
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,981
The conversations were just the beginning.

564
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,900
I've also found records of gifts,

565
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:31,903
of holidays spent at an inn
outside the capital.

566
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,488
( sighs ) What purpose does this serve?

567
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:36,074
-It serves the truth.
-Oh, the truth.

568
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,825
If there's more to this
than meets the eye,

569
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,118
I hope you'll explain,

570
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:42,538
because as it stands
this will severely hurt Dax's defense.

571
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:49,337
My husband was not the hero in life

572
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,964
that he was in death, Mr. Odo.

573
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,842
In death, he became a legend

574
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,928
and I became a legend's wife.

575
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:59,472
There are people who did not
even know my husband

576
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,349
who still contact me.

577
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:04,560
Decades after his death,
they still mourn him.

578
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:05,728
But you don't.

579
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:10,149
No, because I knew the man
before he became a legend.

580
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,693
But I also know my place in history.

581
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:16,155
My place is to carry on bravely,
never to remarry,

582
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:19,492
to represent my husband at the banquets
given in his name.

583
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:22,954
But never, never to talk
about who he really was.

584
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:26,541
Because nobody wants to hear that.

585
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,669
They may have to hear it now.

586
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:35,466
No matter what is said,
they will still embrace his memory...

587
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:43,015
For he was and always will be

588
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:47,395
the hero who died for his people.

589
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:56,195
But perhaps it's time
for my place in history to change.

590
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,873
You've been protecting her reputation.

591
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,749
That's it, isn't it?

592
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:12,170
That's why you won't even defend yourself.

593
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,762
There are worse things
than an illicit love affair.

594
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,931
Curzon didn't murder anybody.

595
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,184
He didn't commit treason.

596
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:31,480
Are you really willing to commit suicide
over something done in another lifetime?

597
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,733
That is what you're doing, you know.

598
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:39,030
My God, Dax.

599
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:41,824
Young Tandro... That wouldn't be your son?

600
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:44,619
You have an overactive imagination,
Benjamin.

601
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,830
Then what is it that's holding you back?
Help me.

602
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:50,374
( grunting )

603
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,877
Damn it, if you were still a man...

604
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,129
( bangs wall )

605
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,968
I see your temper hasn't improved.

606
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,678
Don't talk to me about my temper.

607
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,513
Curzon always warned you about it.

608
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:07,683
You're not going to get me off track here.

609
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:13,064
Do you remember that Argosian Lieutenant
who threw a drink in your face?

610
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:17,652
( both laughing )

611
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:22,448
And you knocked me down with a right cross
before I could kill him.

612
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:26,702
I still have a little scar here
from your ring finger.

613
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:34,627
I tried on that ring after Curzon died.

614
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,798
It just slipped off my finger.

615
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:45,513
If you don't help me, old man,
they're going to take you

616
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:48,307
because I don't know any more arguments.

617
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,103
Then allow it to happen.

618
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:56,774
It is my obligation to protect the lives
of those in my command.

619
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:59,110
You ought to know that,
you taught it to me.

620
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,655
That was Curzon.

621
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:04,949
I'll stop trying to protect you

622
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:08,160
the minute you tell me Curzon was guilty
of these charges.

623
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,745
I won't discuss it with you.

624
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,498
As for Enina Tandro

625
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:16,877
yes, I feel the shame
of Curzon's indiscretion.

626
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:21,007
When one of my kind stumbles, Benjamin,

627
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,634
it is a mistake that's there forever.

628
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:27,805
I can't tell you which part of Curzon Dax

629
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:31,809
couldn't stop himself from acting
shamefully with another man's wife.

630
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:37,315
I can tell you... that he did love her

631
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,817
for whatever that's worth.

632
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:42,361
Enough to kill her husband?

633
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,324
So you are questioning?

634
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,285
What else can I do?

635
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:53,372
Nothing, Benjamin.

636
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,291
Nothing at all.

637
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:15,978
Lieutenant Dax, you are either
200 years older than I am,

638
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:19,774
or you're about the same age
as my great-granddaughter.

639
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,693
At first,
I wondered which of those you were.

640
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:27,615
Now, I am bothered
by the likelihood that you may be both.

641
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,828
Let's finish this, Commander.

642
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:39,251
At what age did the host, Jadzia
first want to be joined as a Trill?

643
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:42,546
I wanted it since I was a child.
I worked very hard for it.

644
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,674
The competition to become
a Trill is very strong, then,

645
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:47,093
among potential hosts?

646
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,762
Yes. It's considered a great honor.

647
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:52,932
How did the young Jadzia finally
become a host candidate?

648
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:57,103
By winning scholarships,
competing against other young people.

649
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,854
You're tested in countless ways.

650
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,398
Including psychological tests

651
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,608
to determine strength of character
of the prospective host.

652
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:03,734
Is that true?

653
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,528
Yes.

654
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:10,699
And the young Jadzia excelled in those
tests of academics and character--

655
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,493
of psychological stability.

656
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:14,829
Yes.

657
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:20,418
If you can remember other things,
remember that as well.

658
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,798
What academic degrees do you hold,
Lieutenant?

659
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:32,304
I hold Premier Distinctions
in exobiology, zoology,

660
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:35,724
astrophysics, and exoarchaeology.

661
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:39,937
How many of those degrees did you earn
before being joined with the symbiont Dax?

662
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,356
All of them.

663
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,400
All of them.

664
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,902
As Jadzia.

665
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:47,945
Alone.

666
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:53,909
This brilliant and independent
young woman

667
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:57,788
has done nothing in her life
but contribute to her society.

668
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:01,459
Madam Arbiter, how can anyone
justify trying her for a crime

669
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:05,212
allegedly committed by another entity
before she was even born?

670
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,259
This will only take a minute.

671
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,137
Lieutenant...

672
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,473
as a Trill candidate,

673
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,309
did Jadzia fully understand
the responsibilities

674
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:20,394
to be assumed upon becoming a Trill,

675
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,938
and did you willingly
accept those responsibilities

676
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:25,524
and whatever consequences
they might entail?

677
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:27,401
Yes.

678
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:30,321
And would that not obviously
include the consequences

679
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:33,115
of criminal acts committed by Curzon Dax?

680
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,700
( door opening )

681
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,504
May I speak?

682
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,255
And you are?

683
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,342
I am Enina Tandro,

684
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:54,386
widow of General Ardelon Tandro.

685
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:56,639
This hearing is unnecessary.

686
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,557
The accusations are erroneous.

687
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,976
Mother, what are you talking about?

688
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,312
Madam Arbiter,

689
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:06,398
Curzon Dax is accused

690
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:10,694
of sending a transmission to the enemy
that betrayed my husband.

691
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:15,241
But I know where Curzon was

692
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:18,202
at the exact time
that transmission was sent.

693
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:25,417
He was... in my bed.

694
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,772
Mr. Tandro,

695
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:50,985
you will want to reexamine
your extradition request.

696
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,070
Until then,

697
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:56,031
this hearing is adjourned.

698
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:12,464
It was kind of you
to try and protect me...

699
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,217
someone you'd never even met.

700
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:18,804
There's much of Curzon
that's still a part of me,

701
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:22,391
that still remembers
what you had together.

702
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:26,186
But it was Curzon Dax
who swore himself to silence

703
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:30,107
to preserve the memory
of General Tandro, not Jadzia.

704
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:34,445
I felt it was important
to keep that promise.

705
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:38,032
The General's memory
is cherished by your people.

706
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:41,243
And it will continue to be.

707
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:46,790
Oh, no one will ever know
that he was the one who tried to betray us

708
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:50,127
and that the rebels
killed him for the favor.

709
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:57,801
As for you,
there is one favor I would ask.

710
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:01,263
Of course.

711
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:04,808
Live, Jadzia Dax.

712
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:17,321
Live a long, fresh, and wonderful life.
