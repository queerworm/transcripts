1
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:20,270
Dress uniform?

2
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,731
I haven't worn this
in almost three years.

3
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,650
I must have lost
a little weight.

4
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,819
Feels kind of baggy.

5
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:30,113
Ah, it looks great.
Besides...

6
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,907
baggy's quite fashionable
on Bajor right now.

7
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:33,742
Lemonade.

8
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:35,870
Since when are you interested
in Bajoran fashions?

9
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:41,876
Well, a lot of Bajoran girls
come to the station...

10
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:43,878
with their families.

11
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:46,714
Since when are you interested
in Bajoran girls?

12
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:48,007
Dad...

13
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:49,550
Wasn't it just a few weeks ago

14
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,719
that you were playing
with model starships?

15
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,637
Try a few years ago.

16
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:57,933
You and I have got to have
a talk, young man,

17
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:59,601
about women.

18
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,812
That's okay.
I mean it.

19
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,605
There are some things
you have<i> got</i> to know.

20
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:04,857
I already know them, Dad.

21
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:06,650
Oh, yeah?
And who told you?

22
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,027
Nog.

23
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,655
Nog.

24
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,198
So, all you know about women

25
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,450
you've heard
from the Ferengi boy.

26
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,244
We were just talking.

27
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:18,704
Great.

28
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:20,247
Listen, I don't have time now,

29
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:22,624
but, obviously, I have
a lot of damage control

30
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,334
to do with you on this subject.

31
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,587
Let's set aside
some time tomorrow.

32
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,923
Fine.

33
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:30,507
Okay, tomorrow morning,
first thing.

34
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,968
Fine. What's
going on anyway?

35
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:35,930
A Vulcan ship has made contact
with a new species called Wadi

36
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,015
in the Gamma Quadrant
three weeks ago.

37
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:40,434
We're expecting a delegation
from their planet.

38
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:41,936
Rolling out
the red carpet, huh?

39
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:45,522
First Contact is our most
important mission, Jake.

40
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,566
It has to be handled delicately.

41
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:49,985
You might say
it's sort of like...

42
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:53,072
a first date
with a girl.

43
00:01:53,072 --> 00:01:55,323
You have to show
a certain respect for...

44
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:58,118
KIRA:
Ops to Sisko.
Go ahead.

45
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,704
The Wadi ship has just come
through the wormhole.

46
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,873
We're sending them
to Docking Bay Four.

47
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:05,960
I'll meet you all there.
Sisko out.

48
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,628
Tomorrow morning.

49
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,933
I'm positive
I packed my dress uniform.

50
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:23,143
I can't understand it.

51
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,437
You look fine, Julian.
Relax.

52
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:28,607
I mean, they are
aliens, aren't they?

53
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:30,943
I mean, they won't know
our protocol.

54
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:32,486
It'll be fine.

55
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,321
Where's your uniform,
Doctor?

56
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,490
Huh? Uh... I can't seem
to find it, sir.

57
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,742
I mean, I'm certain
I packed it.

58
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,661
Listen to me,
this is no dress rehearsal.

59
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,997
This is the real thing--
our first formal reception

60
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:45,248
for a delegation
from the Gamma Quadrant,

61
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:48,043
and I want things to go right
from<i> this</i> moment on.

62
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:49,670
Clear?
Y-Yes.

63
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,254
Let's do it.

64
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:08,730
I am Falow,
Master Surchid of the Wadi.

65
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,024
Welcome in the name of Bajor

66
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:11,942
and the United
Federation of Planets.

67
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,694
I am Commander Benjamin Sisko

68
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,947
and on behalf of my
senior staff officers--

69
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:19,783
Major Kira, Lieutenant Dax,

70
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,994
and Dr. Bashir...

71
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:23,411
Yes, yes, yes.

72
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:26,081
Now, where are the games?

73
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,500
Games?

74
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,252
We were told<i> you</i> had games.

75
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:36,800
Quark's.
Take us to Quark's.

76
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,140
Right this way.

77
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:53,067
First Contact is not
what it used to be.

78
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,977
(<i> buzz of conversation</i> )

79
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,103
Do they have money?

80
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,189
We don't know.
We didn't ask.

81
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:57,274
And that's not
the point.

82
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:58,942
It may not be your point,
but it's mine.

83
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,568
Damn it, Quark, this
is a new life-form

84
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:01,653
from the Gamma Quadrant.

85
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,488
I expect you
to treat them...

86
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,157
Commander... I'm a host.

87
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:07,326
A host is an ambassador
of goodwill.

88
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:09,577
The more goodwill
that I can generate,

89
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,121
the longer they'll stay...

90
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,622
the greater my profits.

91
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,666
I think we're talking
the same language here.

92
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:15,917
Not quite.

93
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,837
Allow me to put
your concerns to rest.

94
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:23,382
So, uh...

95
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,970
do you fellows do
a lot of gambling

96
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,556
where you come from?
We like games.

97
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:32,100
Doesn't everybody?
Doesn't everybody?

98
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,894
You know,
those virgin territories

99
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,436
in the Gamma Quadrant

100
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,813
are ripe
for<i> dabo</i> franchising.

101
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,191
SISKO: Quark...?
You and I might want
to talk

102
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:41,026
about an investment
opportunity...

103
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:45,655
Heh... at some point.

104
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,741
So, uh, have you
figured out

105
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,910
the essentials
of the game yet?

106
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,287
I believe we have.

107
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,081
Give her a spin.

108
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,875
One time on the house.

109
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,299
QUARK:
Ah!

110
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:05,800
Two pinch showing.

111
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,594
Oh, too bad.

112
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,138
Nothing ventured,
nothing gained, I always say.

113
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,307
What would you care to wager?

114
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:13,975
Ah.

115
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,144
Oh.

116
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,312
What a handsome container.

117
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,314
There's an old
Ferengi expression--

118
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,358
good things come
in small packages.

119
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,321
Sticks?

120
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,531
<i>Klon peags.</i>

121
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,410
Highly sought in our culture.

122
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:34,662
They have... many...
different...

123
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,206
uses.

124
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,874
(<i> laughing</i> )

125
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:41,628
I'm sorry, but I have
enough sticks right now.

126
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,883
What's this?

127
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,260
Alpha-currant
nectar.

128
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,845
It's priceless.

129
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:51,888
Oh.

130
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:02,482
One man's priceless
is another man's worthless.

131
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,608
SISKO:
Quark...

132
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,152
take the juice.

133
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:08,738
Sorry, not interested.

134
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,115
FALOW:
Then, we really

135
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:13,285
have nothing to wager...

136
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:15,370
except... this.

137
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,043
(<i> snaps fingers</i> )

138
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,754
Get these folks some drinks.

139
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:33,513
(<i> laughing</i> )

140
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,890
McCoullough.
McCoullough?

141
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,977
Captain McCoullough.
That's the name
I've been trying to remember

142
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,228
for the past six hours.

143
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,147
WADI:
<i>Dabo!</i>

144
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:44,732
Good lord, they've won again.

145
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,567
McCoullough's the one

146
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,862
who wrote the revised
First Contact procedures

147
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,031
for Starfleet.
Is that right?

148
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,325
I wish he was here now
instead of me.

149
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:54,617
WADI:
<i>Dabo!</i>

150
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,328
No...

151
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,788
they couldn't
have doubled again.

152
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,832
With all due respect
to procedures and
to McCoullough,

153
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:03,543
I have had it.
This is as far as duty takes me.

154
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,295
Keep them happy.

155
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,630
If they ever get tired
of playing<i> dabo,</i> let me know.

156
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,923
Good night.

157
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,092
What's good about it?

158
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,560
Getting ready
to call it a night?

159
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,020
(<i> chuckling</i> )

160
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,771
We've only just started.

161
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,565
But...

162
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:29,069
the girl's arm must
be getting tired.

163
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,695
All that spinning.

164
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,072
Replace her.

165
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,074
Very well.

166
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:37,827
Broik...

167
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,914
take the wheel.

168
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:46,794
(<i> click</i> )

169
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,009
Oh...

170
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,844
one pinch showing.

171
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,514
An unfortunate reversal.

172
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,732
What are you
still doing up?

173
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,526
Nog and I were setting up

174
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,903
a reactive ion impeller
for school.

175
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:14,114
Nog is older than you, Jake.

176
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,574
He stays up later.

177
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:16,824
He probably does things--

178
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,826
things with girls,
for instance--

179
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,620
you're not ready for yet.

180
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,664
Come on. We were just
working on a school project.

181
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:27,210
(<i> sighs</i> )
You know what time you're
supposed to go to bed.

182
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,421
We never had any problems

it should be reasonably safe
for us to split up

can find a way out of here.

00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:30,060
would be a transporter,
but a transporter burst

539
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,978
would only last
for a few seconds.

540
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:34,648
Huh... I think we'd
better go take a look.

541
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:36,191
No, wait
a minute, Odo!

542
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,068
You can't just go
storming onto their ship

543
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:39,986
without their
permission.

544
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:42,239
Oh, i-i-is that
Starfleet policy?

545
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:43,574
That's right.

546
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:46,243
Well, I'm not in Starfleet.

547
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:47,536
Set the coordinates

548
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:50,956
to midway down
the second deck corridor.

549
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,710
Uh...
Is it against

550
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,463
Starfleet policy
to press a few buttons?

551
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,342
Energizing.

552
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:40,005
Choose their path.

553
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:42,924
No! This game is finished
right now.

554
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,677
Stop the game,
lose your players.

555
00:30:44,677 --> 00:30:46,094
QUARK:
Odo...

556
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,597
just stay out of it.
Quark!

557
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:51,183
I'm doing fine;
they're doing fine.

558
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,810
Choose their path.

559
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:56,396
Double their peril,
double your winnings.

560
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:59,983
Quark!

561
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:03,111
Fine, fine!
The safer path.

562
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,781
Roll.

563
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,367
(<i> blows</i> )

564
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:17,042
An unfortunate roll.

565
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,047
Isn't it
simply a matter

566
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:24,007
of figuring out
how to win this game?

567
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,968
Simply? I don't think we have
any other choice.

568
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:29,221
Well, seriously, we've gone
from the second<i> shap</i>

569
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,640
to the third<i> shap</i>
to the fourth<i> shap</i> already.

570
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,683
What is a<i> shap?</i>

571
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:34,059
I have no idea,

572
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:35,811
but we're making progress,
whatever it is.

573
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:37,937
We're playing for our
lives here, Doctor.

574
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:40,649
I don't think you're
taking this very seriously.

575
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:42,192
On the contrary, Major.

576
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:44,110
I find the stakes
to be highly motivating.

577
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:47,030
(<i> machinery humming</i> )
Listen.

578
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:50,992
I'm reading high
magnetic field variations.

579
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,328
Intense flux patterns.

580
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,954
It's coming toward us.

581
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,998
Find cover if you can.

582
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,255
Falow!

583
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:48,425
Next move.

584
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:51,052
What happened to that one?
Why is it there?

585
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,262
Next move.

586
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:53,597
Choose your path.

587
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:54,681
Listen to me.

588
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,057
I want that player back!

589
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,644
If you would care
to play the game

590
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:01,605
after he's done,
it can be arranged.

591
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:03,022
Choose their path.

592
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:05,943
Double their peril,
double your winnings.

593
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:08,153
Give me
the shortcut.
The shortcut?!

594
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:09,571
It's the right
thing to do.

595
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:11,865
Are you crazy?!
Double the stakes.

596
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:12,825
Wait!

597
00:33:12,825 --> 00:33:14,242
I know what
I'm doing.

598
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,619
I've spent my life

599
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,245
figuring the odds on
all sorts of games.

600
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,331
Now, I'm just learning
this one, that's true,

601
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:21,667
but I<i> know</i> this
is the right move.

602
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:23,209
The right move
to make you rich.

603
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,252
More than that.

604
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,087
Look at the board.

605
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:30,175
The shortcut skips
a whole level.

606
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:34,304
I've learned there are risks
in every roll of the dice.

607
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:38,224
This way, they can
advance all the way home

608
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:40,978
on just one move.

609
00:33:40,978 --> 00:33:43,981
Trust a gambler.

610
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,362
Roll.

611
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,117
What?

612
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,619
Blow on them.

613
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:00,038
Would you please just...?
Blow on them.

614
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,717
<i>Thialo.</i>

615
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:14,219
What?
What does it mean?

616
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,429
Sacrifice one

617
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:19,599
so that two may live.

618
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,155
You can't ask him
to do that.

619
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:37,993
If you do not sacrifice one,
all three will be lost.

620
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:40,119
I can't. Please.

621
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,788
Which player?

622
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:45,542
I don't even know
which one is which.

623
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:48,294
Select one to be sacrificed,
or this game is finished!

624
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:50,881
Fine!
Fine!

625
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:52,966
Fine.

626
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:55,010
Fine.

627
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:08,106
I can't do it.

628
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,691
I beg of you.

629
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:11,985
A terrible mistake
has been made.

630
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:14,404
This is all a misunderstanding.

631
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:16,322
Please.

632
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:19,076
I-I've learned my lesson.

633
00:35:19,076 --> 00:35:21,119
I'll never cheat again.

634
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,872
I'll never cheat again!

635
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:25,665
Please!

636
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:28,418
Just don't make me
do this.

637
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:30,754
Anything but this.

638
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:33,006
Please!

639
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:35,300
Please!

640
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,262
Please!

641
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,056
Oh!

642
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:43,850
(<i> sobbing</i> )

643
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,770
Plea...

644
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:49,106
(<i> sobbing continues</i> )

645
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:53,526
Oh, please, please.

646
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:54,987
Very well.

647
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,868
I don't have to sacrifice
one of them?

648
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,912
No. You do not.

649
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:12,045
We'll program the game
to select one at random.

650
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:14,714
Final wagers.

651
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:17,258
Last move.

652
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,594
( Klon peags<i> clicking</i> )

653
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:23,890
We should have eaten
something at the party

654
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,517
when we had the chance.

655
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,352
BASHIR:
<i>Commander Sisko!</i>

656
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:28,436
Doctor.

657
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,313
<i>Over here! Hurry!</i>

658
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:31,898
Where's it
coming from?

659
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,274
Spread out.

660
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,651
<i>I can see it!</i>

661
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:37,362
<i>I found the way home!</i>

662
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,658
Over here.
I found an open door.

663
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:42,909
<i>Come on, Dax!</i>

664
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:45,954
Julian!

665
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:47,664
<i>Hurry up!</i>

666
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:50,000
Julian, are you all right?

667
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,751
(<i> rumbling</i> )

668
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,419
(<i> screaming</i> )

669
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:54,880
Dax!

670
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,757
Ah! My leg.

671
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,680
Don't move.

672
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,557
Nothing's broken.

673
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:07,726
BASHIR:
What's taking so long?

674
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,310
We're almost out of here.

675
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,812
Can't you see it?

676
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:11,855
Doctor.

677
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:14,649
We need some help.

678
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,943
Dax is hurt.

679
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:23,241
<i>Thialo.</i>

680
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,869
Move along home.

681
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:26,912
<i>Shap...</i>

six.

683
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:32,500
I'm reading
a tectonic shift

684
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,877
of two ground masses.

685
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:35,754
We are directly
over the fault line.

686
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,296
The cavern wall
structure

687
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:39,507
has been significantly
weakened by the stress.

688
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,218
It's not going to
hold much longer.

689
00:37:41,218 --> 00:37:43,302
See if you can put
some weight on it.

690
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:44,512
(<i> screams</i> )

691
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,973
Come on. Let's get
out of here.

692
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:59,129
(<i> rock clattering</i> )

693
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,008
I'll never make it across.

694
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:04,884
There's got to be
a way around this.

695
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,845
Benjamin, you and Kira
can make that jump.

696
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,721
We're not leaving you here.

697
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,223
This cavern is
going to collapse

698
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:12,851
and kill all of us
if you don't go now.

699
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,936
Seven lives is more
than enough for a Trill.

700
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:17,396
You haven't even
finished one.

701
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,316
How could I
live out<i> that</i> life

702
00:39:19,316 --> 00:39:21,442
knowing I left you
behind, old man?

703
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,111
Don't let sentiment
get in the way...

704
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:24,570
BOTH:
Of command decisions.

705
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:28,783
Yeah. I've heard
that one somewhere.

706
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:35,540
If you were hurt...

707
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,500
I'd leave you behind.

708
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,503
Then I'm glad I'm not
the one who's hurt.

709
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:41,671
Major.

710
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:44,966
Major, you go across.

711
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:47,177
We'll find a way around.

712
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:53,266
SISKO:
We'll be all right.

713
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:58,771
Major, I gave you
a direct order.
Court-martial me.

714
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,857
I can't. You're not
in Starfleet.

715
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,817
If I were
a superior officer,

716
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:05,153
I'd court-martial
both of you.

717
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:08,240
(<i> rumbling</i> )

718
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,370
(<i> grunting</i> )

719
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,996
Oh!

720
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:28,736
Only a few meters more.

721
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:57,140
(<i> yells</i> )

722
00:41:58,183 --> 00:42:00,101
(<i> yells</i> )

723
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:05,564
Hang on!

724
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,861
Benjamin!

725
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:12,530
(<i> screaming</i> )

726
00:42:19,496 --> 00:42:20,872
They made it!

727
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:22,290
I won.

728
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:24,834
I had full confidence
in you, Commander.

729
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:26,836
There wasn't
a moment's doubt

730
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:29,381
that you would prevail
in this outrageous...

731
00:42:29,381 --> 00:42:30,840
No, Quark.

732
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:35,094
I'm afraid
all your<i> players</i>

733
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,179
were lost.

734
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:38,223
What? You mean...

735
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:41,351
we were never
in any real danger?

736
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:45,771
It's only a game.

737
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:46,898
(<i> laughing</i> )

738
00:42:55,407 --> 00:42:58,451
Time to move along home.

739
00:42:58,451 --> 00:42:59,869
Not so fast.

740
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:02,080
This may all have
been a game to you,

741
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,832
but we take First Contact
with a new species

742
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:07,544
very seriously,
and I don't appreciate...

743
00:43:07,544 --> 00:43:08,878
ODO:
Excuse me,
Commander.

744
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:09,837
Yes, Odo.

745
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:12,298
Before you blame them,

746
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:15,176
you might want to ask Quark

747
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:17,303
just how this
all started.

748
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:19,638
Quark.

749
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:21,891
I wish I could
explain it.

750
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:26,312
Uh... they just had
a run of bad luck,

751
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,022
and then they blamed
me for their losses.

752
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:28,981
And, uh...

753
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,316
That's not what you said

754
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:33,152
when you were groveling
on the floor.

755
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:35,821
Oh, that's right.

756
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:37,907
You were here
for the groveling.

757
00:43:37,907 --> 00:43:39,576
Uh...

758
00:43:39,576 --> 00:43:43,413
You said something
about cheating, didn't you?

759
00:43:43,413 --> 00:43:44,830
Cheating?

760
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:47,500
I would have said anything
to end the ordeal.

761
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,002
It was too much
for me to bear.

762
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,463
You have no idea

763
00:43:51,463 --> 00:43:54,340
the pressure I was
under, Commander.

764
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:57,802
If you will excuse us...

765
00:43:57,802 --> 00:44:00,305
Perhaps someday...

766
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:02,014
a rematch.

767
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,854
You know...

768
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:11,690
this game could work here.

769
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:16,571
It really could.

770
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:17,947
Excuse me.

771
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:19,365
Falow?

772
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:21,326
Uh, Mr. Falow?

773
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:23,202
A word with you, sir.

774
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:24,996
What's your hurry?

775
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:27,832
I think you'll like this.

776
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:29,875
Mr. Falow!
