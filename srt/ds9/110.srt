1
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:20,593
Dress uniform?

2
00:00:20,627 --> 00:00:22,220
I haven't worn this

3
00:00:22,264 --> 00:00:23,755
in almost three years.

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,430
I must have lost
a little weight.

5
00:00:26,471 --> 00:00:28,441
Feels kind of baggy.

6
00:00:28,475 --> 00:00:30,103
Ah, it looks great.

7
00:00:30,145 --> 00:00:31,408
Besides...

8
00:00:31,447 --> 00:00:33,542
baggy's quite fashionable
on Bajor right now.

9
00:00:33,584 --> 00:00:34,882
Lemonade.

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,117
Since when are you interested
in Bajoran fashions?

11
00:00:37,224 --> 00:00:43,134
Well, a lot of Bajoran girls
come to the station...

12
00:00:43,169 --> 00:00:45,139
with their families.

13
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:47,800
Since when are you interested
in Bajoran girls?

14
00:00:47,843 --> 00:00:49,277
Dad...

15
00:00:49,312 --> 00:00:50,746
Wasn't it just a few weeks ago

16
00:00:50,782 --> 00:00:52,809
that you were playing
with model starships?

17
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:54,822
Try a few years ago.

18
00:00:54,856 --> 00:00:59,159
You and I have got to have
a talk, young man

19
00:00:59,197 --> 00:01:00,961
about women.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,093
That's okay.

21
00:01:02,136 --> 00:01:03,104
I mean it.

22
00:01:03,137 --> 00:01:04,628
There are some things
you have got to know.

23
00:01:04,674 --> 00:01:06,108
I already know them, Dad.

24
00:01:06,176 --> 00:01:07,667
Oh, yeah?
And who told you?

25
00:01:07,712 --> 00:01:09,180
Nog.

26
00:01:10,484 --> 00:01:12,716
Nog.

27
00:01:12,754 --> 00:01:14,450
So, all you know about women

28
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:16,553
you've heard
from the Ferengi boy.

29
00:01:16,595 --> 00:01:18,393
We were just talking.

30
00:01:18,432 --> 00:01:19,798
Great.

31
00:01:19,834 --> 00:01:21,063
Listen, I don't have time now

32
00:01:21,103 --> 00:01:23,665
but, obviously, I have
a lot of damage control

33
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,540
to do with you on this subject.

34
00:01:25,577 --> 00:01:27,672
Let's set aside
some time tomorrow.

35
00:01:27,715 --> 00:01:30,015
Fine.

36
00:01:30,052 --> 00:01:31,645
Okay, tomorrow morning,
first thing.

37
00:01:31,688 --> 00:01:34,056
Fine. What's going on anyway?

38
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:37,155
A Vulcan ship has made contact
with a new species called Wadi

39
00:01:37,232 --> 00:01:39,134
in the Gamma Quadrant
three weeks ago.

40
00:01:39,168 --> 00:01:41,570
We're expecting a delegation
from their planet.

41
00:01:41,606 --> 00:01:43,165
Rolling out the red carpet, huh?

42
00:01:43,243 --> 00:01:46,579
First Contact is our most
important mission, Jake.

43
00:01:46,615 --> 00:01:48,778
It has to be handled delicately.

44
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:51,085
You might say
it's sort of like...

45
00:01:51,124 --> 00:01:53,094
a first date

46
00:01:53,127 --> 00:01:54,095
with a girl.

47
00:01:54,129 --> 00:01:55,119
You have to show

48
00:01:55,164 --> 00:01:56,598
a certain respect for...

49
00:01:56,633 --> 00:01:58,033
Ops to Sisko.

50
00:01:58,069 --> 00:01:59,401
Go ahead.

51
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:01,840
The Wadi ship has just come
through the wormhole.

52
00:02:01,876 --> 00:02:03,937
We're sending them
to Docking Bay Four.

53
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,107
I'll meet you all there.

54
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:06,947
Sisko out.

55
00:02:06,986 --> 00:02:08,648
Tomorrow morning.

56
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:22,175
I'm positive
I packed my dress uniform.

57
00:02:22,213 --> 00:02:24,115
I can't understand it.

58
00:02:24,149 --> 00:02:26,585
You look fine, Julian.
Relax.

59
00:02:26,621 --> 00:02:29,717
I mean, they are aliens,
aren't they?

60
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,196
I mean, they won't know
our protocol.

61
00:02:32,231 --> 00:02:33,631
It'll be fine.

62
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:35,499
Where's your uniform, Doctor?

63
00:02:35,536 --> 00:02:37,699
Huh? Uh... I can't seem
to find it, sir.

64
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,802
I mean, I'm certain I packed it.

65
00:02:39,845 --> 00:02:41,747
Listen to me,
this is no dress rehearsal.

66
00:02:41,781 --> 00:02:44,217
This is the real thing...
our first formal reception

67
00:02:44,252 --> 00:02:46,415
for a delegation
from the Gamma Quadrant

68
00:02:46,456 --> 00:02:49,222
and I want things to go right
from this moment on.

69
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,956
- Clear?
- Y-Yes.

70
00:02:50,998 --> 00:02:52,591
Let's do it.

71
00:03:07,461 --> 00:03:09,897
I am Falow,
Master Surchid of the Wadi.

72
00:03:09,932 --> 00:03:11,457
Welcome in the name of Bajor

73
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:13,333
and the United
Federation of Planets.

74
00:03:13,372 --> 00:03:15,204
I am Commander Benjamin Sisko

75
00:03:15,241 --> 00:03:18,337
and on behalf
of my senior staff officers...

76
00:03:18,381 --> 00:03:21,216
Major Kira, Lieutenant Dax

77
00:03:21,252 --> 00:03:23,188
and Dr. Bashir...

78
00:03:23,222 --> 00:03:24,713
Yes, yes, yes.

79
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:27,229
Now, where are the games?

80
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:29,860
Games?

81
00:03:29,901 --> 00:03:32,565
We were told you had games.

82
00:03:34,509 --> 00:03:38,004
Quark's.
Take us to Quark's.

83
00:03:42,924 --> 00:03:44,483
Right this way.

84
00:03:51,406 --> 00:03:54,241
First Contact is not
what it used to be.

85
00:05:52,862 --> 00:05:54,023
Do they have money?

86
00:05:54,065 --> 00:05:56,194
We don't know.

87
00:05:56,236 --> 00:05:57,204
We didn't ask.

88
00:05:57,238 --> 00:05:58,206
And that's not the point.

89
00:05:58,239 --> 00:05:59,832
It may not be your point,
but it's mine.

90
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,434
Damn it, Quark,
this is a new life-form

91
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:02,468
from the Gamma Quadrant.

92
00:06:02,513 --> 00:06:04,379
I expect you to treat them...

93
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,078
Commander... I'm a host.

94
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,215
A host is an ambassador
of goodwill.

95
00:06:08,257 --> 00:06:10,454
The more goodwill
that I can generate

96
00:06:10,494 --> 00:06:11,985
the longer they'll stay...

97
00:06:12,097 --> 00:06:13,497
the greater my profits.

98
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:15,526
I think we're talking
the same language here.

99
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:16,697
Not quite.

100
00:06:16,739 --> 00:06:19,676
Allow me to put
your concerns to rest.

101
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,409
So, uh...

102
00:06:25,421 --> 00:06:27,823
do you fellows do
a lot of gambling

103
00:06:27,859 --> 00:06:29,259
where you come from?

104
00:06:29,295 --> 00:06:30,490
We like games.

105
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,864
Doesn't everybody?
Doesn't everybody?

106
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:35,235
You know,
those virgin territories

107
00:06:35,272 --> 00:06:36,763
in the Gamma Quadrant

108
00:06:36,808 --> 00:06:38,037
are ripe for dabo franchising.

109
00:06:38,077 --> 00:06:39,045
Quark?

110
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,377
You and I might want to talk

111
00:06:40,415 --> 00:06:42,281
about an investment
opportunity...

112
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:46,823
Heh... at some point.

113
00:06:46,859 --> 00:06:51,231
So, uh, have you figured out
the essentials of the game yet?

114
00:06:51,268 --> 00:06:53,500
I believe we have.

115
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:55,371
Give her a spin.

116
00:06:55,408 --> 00:06:57,970
One time on the house.

117
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:05,490
Ah!

118
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:06,892
Two pinch showing.

119
00:07:06,929 --> 00:07:08,192
Oh, too bad.

120
00:07:08,231 --> 00:07:11,327
Nothing ventured,
nothing gained, I always say.

121
00:07:11,371 --> 00:07:13,466
What would you care to wager?

122
00:07:13,508 --> 00:07:14,999
Ah.

123
00:07:16,213 --> 00:07:17,340
Oh.

124
00:07:17,382 --> 00:07:18,543
What a handsome container.

125
00:07:18,584 --> 00:07:20,486
There's an old
Ferengi expression...

126
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,513
good things come
in small packages.

127
00:07:25,763 --> 00:07:27,493
Sticks?

128
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:29,696
<i>Klon peags.</i>

129
00:07:29,737 --> 00:07:32,606
Highly sought in our culture.

130
00:07:32,642 --> 00:07:35,808
They have... many...
different...

131
00:07:35,847 --> 00:07:37,440
uses.

132
00:07:39,053 --> 00:07:42,753
I'm sorry, but I have
enough sticks right now.

133
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:48,065
What's this?

134
00:07:48,103 --> 00:07:49,503
Alpha-currant nectar.

135
00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:51,941
It's priceless.

136
00:07:51,976 --> 00:07:53,171
Oh.

137
00:08:00,892 --> 00:08:03,624
One man's priceless
is another man's worthless.

138
00:08:03,665 --> 00:08:04,690
Quark...

139
00:08:04,732 --> 00:08:06,325
take the juice.

140
00:08:06,369 --> 00:08:09,830
Sorry, not interested.

141
00:08:09,876 --> 00:08:14,476
Then, we really
have nothing to wager...

142
00:08:14,517 --> 00:08:16,510
except... this.

143
00:08:23,299 --> 00:08:25,826
Get these folks some drinks.

144
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,710
McCoullough.

145
00:08:35,755 --> 00:08:36,745
McCoullough?

146
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,019
Captain McCoullough.

147
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,222
That's the name
I've been trying to remember

148
00:08:40,264 --> 00:08:41,527
for the past six hours.

149
00:08:41,566 --> 00:08:43,432
Dabo!

150
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:45,871
Good lord, they've won again.

151
00:08:45,907 --> 00:08:47,273
McCoullough's the one

152
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,145
who wrote the revised
First Contact procedures

153
00:08:50,248 --> 00:08:51,147
for Starfleet.

154
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,309
Is that right?

155
00:08:52,352 --> 00:08:54,549
I wish he was here now
instead of me.

156
00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:55,784
Dabo!

157
00:08:55,824 --> 00:08:57,656
No...

158
00:08:57,695 --> 00:09:00,165
they couldn't
have doubled again.

159
00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:02,533
With all due respect
to procedures and to McCoullough

160
00:09:02,571 --> 00:09:03,561
I have had it.

161
00:09:03,606 --> 00:09:05,074
This is as far as duty takes me.

162
00:09:05,108 --> 00:09:06,474
Keep them happy.

163
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:09,073
If they ever get tired
of playing dabo, let me know.

164
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,208
Good night.

165
00:09:10,251 --> 00:09:12,278
What's good about it?

166
00:09:19,634 --> 00:09:21,661
Getting ready
to call it a night?

167
00:09:23,107 --> 00:09:24,837
We've only just started.

168
00:09:24,877 --> 00:09:26,779
But...

169
00:09:26,814 --> 00:09:29,148
the girl's arm must
be getting tired.

170
00:09:29,185 --> 00:09:32,020
All that spinning.

171
00:09:32,056 --> 00:09:33,524
Replace her.

172
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:35,495
Very well.

173
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,095
Broik...

174
00:09:40,472 --> 00:09:41,770
take the wheel.

175
00:09:52,794 --> 00:09:54,490
Oh...

176
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,328
one pinch showing.

177
00:09:56,367 --> 00:09:58,860
An unfortunate reversal.

178
00:10:07,421 --> 00:10:09,219
What are you still doing up?

179
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,918
Nog and I were setting up

180
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,191
a reactive ion impeller
for school.

181
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,224
Nog is older than you, Jake.

182
00:10:16,303 --> 00:10:17,498
He stays up later.

183
00:10:17,539 --> 00:10:18,905
He probably does things...

184
00:10:18,941 --> 00:10:20,739
things with girls,
for instance...

185
00:10:20,777 --> 00:10:22,006
you're not ready for yet.

186
00:10:22,046 --> 00:10:23,014
Come on.

187
00:10:23,048 --> 00:10:25,211
We were just working on
a school project.

188
00:10:26,521 --> 00:10:28,753
You know what time you're
supposed to go to bed.

189
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:30,853
We never had any problems
with it until Nog.

190
00:10:30,895 --> 00:10:32,761
Dad, I'm 14.

191
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,894
I'm glad we agree on something.

192
00:10:34,937 --> 00:10:36,166
Go to bed.

193
00:10:36,206 --> 00:10:38,038
Fine.

194
00:10:38,075 --> 00:10:40,204
So, how did it go?

195
00:10:40,246 --> 00:10:41,373
Great. Just great.

196
00:10:41,415 --> 00:10:43,476
I've done nothing
for the past six hours

197
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,282
but eat Ferengi <i>lokar</i> beans...

198
00:10:46,657 --> 00:10:49,321
and watch people
play childish games.

199
00:10:58,445 --> 00:11:00,073
Broik!

200
00:11:00,115 --> 00:11:01,743
You disreputable swindler.

201
00:11:01,785 --> 00:11:04,951
I've put up with your cheating
for the last time.

202
00:11:22,354 --> 00:11:23,447
Sit.

203
00:11:28,299 --> 00:11:29,733
Look, uh...

204
00:11:29,768 --> 00:11:34,436
why don't we just call it even,
and no hard feelings, huh?

205
00:11:34,476 --> 00:11:37,846
Or, uh, take another spin...
on the house

206
00:11:37,883 --> 00:11:39,317
or two or three.

207
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:42,481
A free visit to a holosuite, eh?

208
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:45,621
Do you know what a holosuite is?

209
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:48,600
Do you have sex on your world?

210
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,748
Look, take it all back...
all the gemstones

211
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:59,845
and I'll throw in a case
of Andolian brandy

212
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:02,655
to make your trip home
a little more enjoyable, huh?

213
00:12:02,694 --> 00:12:04,287
You like our gemstones?

214
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,301
You will have the opportunity
to win more...

215
00:12:07,402 --> 00:12:08,461
a lot more.

216
00:12:08,504 --> 00:12:09,665
I will?

217
00:12:09,706 --> 00:12:11,038
In a new game.

218
00:12:11,075 --> 00:12:13,978
An honest game.

219
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,193
Very unusual.

220
00:12:30,232 --> 00:12:32,134
I don't think I know this game.

221
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:33,228
What's it called?

222
00:12:33,271 --> 00:12:34,671
<i>Chula.</i>

223
00:12:34,706 --> 00:12:36,903
What are the rules?

224
00:12:36,944 --> 00:12:39,676
These are your players.

225
00:12:39,715 --> 00:12:44,247
We'll start them
at the second <i>shap.</i>

226
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,316
The second <i>shap?</i>

227
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:47,454
Can't we start at the beginning?

228
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:52,670
Only children enter
at the first <i>shap.</i>

229
00:13:44,999 --> 00:13:48,267
Sisko to Ops.

230
00:13:48,306 --> 00:13:50,970
Sisko to Security.

231
00:13:51,077 --> 00:13:54,516
Computer, freeze program.

232
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,646
End program.

233
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,957
Exit!

234
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,125
You?

235
00:14:58,165 --> 00:14:59,463
<i>Shap</i> two.

236
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,991
Move along.
Move along home.

237
00:15:01,036 --> 00:15:02,972
Where is this place?
Where have you brought me?

238
00:15:03,007 --> 00:15:04,977
Move along home!

239
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,342
Falow!

240
00:15:23,109 --> 00:15:24,600
Doctor.

241
00:15:26,114 --> 00:15:28,016
Oh, thank God!

242
00:15:28,118 --> 00:15:31,021
Ah. I thought
I was having a nightmare.

243
00:15:31,123 --> 00:15:32,785
I couldn't wake up.

244
00:15:32,827 --> 00:15:34,455
You, too?

245
00:15:34,497 --> 00:15:35,965
What was all that yelling?

246
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:37,228
Well, haven't you

247
00:15:37,268 --> 00:15:38,896
ever had
to wake yourself up

248
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,031
out of a bad dream?

249
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,838
This isn't a dream.
We're guests of the Wadi.

250
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:44,279
What do they want?

251
00:15:44,314 --> 00:15:45,441
I don't know yet.

252
00:15:45,483 --> 00:15:47,419
I just had a strange
run-in with Falow.

253
00:15:47,453 --> 00:15:49,787
He had said something
about "moving along home."

254
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,224
Home?

255
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,628
Perhaps they're giving us
some sort of behavioral test

256
00:15:53,664 --> 00:15:54,723
like a laboratory rodent

257
00:15:54,766 --> 00:15:56,736
who must work his way
out of a maze.

258
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:57,863
Behavioral test?

259
00:15:57,906 --> 00:15:59,067
Now wait a minute.

260
00:15:59,174 --> 00:16:01,576
There doesn't seem to be
any immediate threat, Major.

261
00:16:01,612 --> 00:16:04,014
Oh, no, I'm sure
all you Starfleet explorers

262
00:16:04,117 --> 00:16:05,983
find this absolutely fascinating

263
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,422
but I'm
a Bajoran administrator.

264
00:16:08,457 --> 00:16:11,019
This is not
what I signed up for!

265
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:14,032
I don't find this
fascinating either, Major

266
00:16:14,135 --> 00:16:16,731
but I suggest we take Falow's
advice and find our way home.

267
00:16:16,773 --> 00:16:19,744
Do the combadges
still work?

268
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,716
As long as we can
maintain contact

269
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,585
it should be reasonably safe
for us to split up

270
00:16:25,622 --> 00:16:27,649
and see if any of us
can find a way out of here.

271
00:16:27,693 --> 00:16:29,822
Use your tricorders
for proximity checks

272
00:16:29,862 --> 00:16:31,160
every two minutes.

273
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:35,069
And if all else fails,
just yell again, Doctor.

274
00:16:35,173 --> 00:16:37,166
We'll find you.

275
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:55,870
Mr. Sisko, how can I help you?

276
00:16:55,909 --> 00:16:57,537
Do you know
where my dad's gone?

277
00:16:57,579 --> 00:16:59,275
You can't find him?

278
00:16:59,316 --> 00:17:00,944
Last night,
he was making a big deal

279
00:17:00,985 --> 00:17:02,578
about us having
a talk this morning

280
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:04,317
but, when I got up,
he was gone.

281
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:06,054
Have you checked his office?

282
00:17:06,161 --> 00:17:08,654
The computer says
he's not on the station.

283
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:13,800
Why don't you go on to school
while I track him down.

284
00:17:13,841 --> 00:17:15,834
School's closed
while Mrs. O'Brien's

285
00:17:15,879 --> 00:17:16,847
back on Earth.

286
00:17:16,881 --> 00:17:18,577
Nog and I were going over
to Airlock Three

287
00:17:18,617 --> 00:17:20,381
and watch the Bajoran
transport passengers

288
00:17:20,421 --> 00:17:21,719
come on board.

289
00:17:21,756 --> 00:17:23,919
You mean, to look at the girls.

290
00:17:26,197 --> 00:17:27,665
No.

291
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,191
We were just, uh...

292
00:17:29,236 --> 00:17:30,431
Go on.

293
00:17:30,472 --> 00:17:32,100
When I find out where
your father went

294
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,107
I'll let you know.

295
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,872
Thanks, Odo.

296
00:17:38,019 --> 00:17:40,114
Computer, confirm
that Commander Sisko

297
00:17:40,222 --> 00:17:41,690
is not on the station.

298
00:17:41,726 --> 00:17:43,024
Confirmed.

299
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:44,859
What time did he log out?

300
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,867
That information is not on file.

301
00:17:46,901 --> 00:17:48,871
What ship did he leave on?

302
00:17:48,904 --> 00:17:51,670
That information is not on file.

303
00:17:55,851 --> 00:17:57,513
Constable Odo...

304
00:17:57,553 --> 00:17:59,648
good morning to you.

305
00:17:59,691 --> 00:18:01,159
Where's Major Kira?

306
00:18:01,193 --> 00:18:04,495
Didn't report for duty
on time this morning.

307
00:18:04,533 --> 00:18:06,297
None of the senior officers did.

308
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:08,100
And you don't find that odd?

309
00:18:08,173 --> 00:18:11,942
I heard that Wadi party
went on all night.

310
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,680
How long have you been
a security officer, Lieutenant?

311
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,120
Six years. Why?

312
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:18,690
Lost many Commanders?

313
00:18:18,725 --> 00:18:20,023
Lost?

314
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,528
Because you've lost one now.

315
00:18:21,564 --> 00:18:23,557
Sisko's off the station,
missing.

316
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,466
All of the senior officers
may be missing.

317
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:26,836
I want a sweep of this station.

318
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:28,843
And if the others
are missing, too

319
00:18:28,876 --> 00:18:31,403
I want to know the last time
anybody saw them.

320
00:18:31,447 --> 00:18:32,710
I'm going to contact all ships

321
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,309
that have departed
since last night.

322
00:18:34,353 --> 00:18:35,378
Understood?

323
00:18:35,422 --> 00:18:36,890
Yes, Constable.

324
00:18:36,925 --> 00:18:38,553
And don't call me "Constable."

325
00:18:38,594 --> 00:18:40,564
I'm Chief of Security.

326
00:18:40,598 --> 00:18:42,727
Yes, sir.

327
00:18:45,272 --> 00:18:47,333
Last wagers.

328
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,401
The board is ready.

329
00:18:48,445 --> 00:18:50,472
It is?

330
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:53,851
How much do you wish to risk

331
00:18:53,888 --> 00:18:55,516
on the second <i>shap?</i>

332
00:18:55,558 --> 00:18:57,186
Um...

333
00:18:57,228 --> 00:18:58,696
uh...

334
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,221
is there a minimum wager?

335
00:19:04,241 --> 00:19:06,073
Roll.

336
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,874
Roll? Roll?

337
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:10,885
But you haven't even
told me the rules yet.

338
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:13,890
You're required to learn
as you play.

339
00:19:13,924 --> 00:19:15,654
Roll.

340
00:19:24,944 --> 00:19:26,037
<i>Chula!</i>

341
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,741
Did I win?

342
00:19:27,782 --> 00:19:29,182
Hardly.

343
00:19:29,286 --> 00:19:32,348
Your pieces
will meet the Chandra.

344
00:19:32,391 --> 00:19:33,654
The Chandra?
What does that mean?

345
00:19:33,693 --> 00:19:34,661
Is it good or bad?

346
00:19:36,298 --> 00:19:38,200
Neither. Both.

347
00:19:38,268 --> 00:19:40,500
I don't understand.

348
00:19:40,539 --> 00:19:42,509
Ah, but there's the key.

349
00:19:42,542 --> 00:19:44,204
Some will never understand

350
00:19:44,313 --> 00:19:47,615
while others will consider it...

351
00:19:47,651 --> 00:19:49,814
mere child's play.

352
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,536
<i>Allamaraine,</i> count to four

353
00:20:26,578 --> 00:20:28,376
<i>Allamaraine,</i> then three more

354
00:20:28,415 --> 00:20:30,145
<i>Allamaraine,</i> if you can see

355
00:20:30,185 --> 00:20:32,246
This is Sisko.
I found something.

356
00:20:32,289 --> 00:20:34,623
<i>Allamaraine,</i>
you'll come with me.

357
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:38,064
<i>Allamaraine,</i> count to four

358
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,570
<i>Allamaraine,</i> then three more

359
00:20:40,604 --> 00:20:42,836
<i>Allamaraine,</i> if you can see

360
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,675
<i>Allamaraine...</i>

361
00:20:47,516 --> 00:20:49,577
<i>Allamaraine,</i> count to four

362
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,954
<i>Allamaraine,</i> then three more

363
00:20:52,058 --> 00:20:54,187
<i>Allamaraine,</i> if you can see

00:20:54,229 --> 00:20:56,061

00:20:56,098 --> 00:20:58,261

00:21:03,078 --> 00:21:05,878
<i>Allamaraine,</i>
you'll come with me

00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:08,148
<i>Allamaraine,</i> count to four

370
00:21:08,187 --> 00:21:09,655
<i>Allamaraine,</i> then three more

371
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:11,124
<i>Allamaraine,</i> if you can see

372
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:12,855
<i>Allamaraine,</i>
you'll come with me

373
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,057
Hello.

374
00:21:14,097 --> 00:21:15,565
<i>Allamaraine,</i> count to four

375
00:21:15,601 --> 00:21:17,399
<i>Allamaraine,</i> then three more...

376
00:21:17,437 --> 00:21:18,905
Can you tell us where we are?

377
00:21:18,939 --> 00:21:20,532
<i>Allamaraine,</i> if you can see

378
00:21:20,576 --> 00:21:21,601
<i>Allamaraine...</i>

379
00:21:21,644 --> 00:21:23,637
Is there a way to leave?

380
00:21:23,681 --> 00:21:25,583
Do you think we're supposed
to do something?

381
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:27,851
Well, this is the first door
that's opened for us.

382
00:21:27,888 --> 00:21:29,550
I want to know where it goes.

383
00:21:31,061 --> 00:21:32,791
Are you all right?

384
00:21:32,831 --> 00:21:33,799
<i>Allamaraine...</i>

385
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,096
I'll be okay.

386
00:21:35,135 --> 00:21:36,967
Some kind of ionic field.

387
00:21:37,072 --> 00:21:39,975
She goes right through it.

388
00:21:40,077 --> 00:21:42,547
The panels on the floor.

389
00:21:42,582 --> 00:21:44,414
She steps on certain panels

390
00:21:44,452 --> 00:21:46,888
which must allow her
to go through the field.

391
00:21:46,923 --> 00:21:48,789
"If you can see,
you'll come with me."

392
00:21:48,826 --> 00:21:50,989
...you'll come with me,
<i>Allamaraine...</i>

393
00:21:51,097 --> 00:21:52,656
Watch this.

394
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,225
<i>Allamaraine,</i> count to four

395
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,932

<i>Allamaraine,</i>
you'll come with me...

400
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:07,686
But I did everything she did.

401
00:22:07,727 --> 00:22:09,959
No, Julian, you didn't.

402
00:22:10,065 --> 00:22:12,968
I followed her footsteps,
exactly.

403
00:22:13,071 --> 00:22:15,064
But you didn't say the rhyme.

404
00:22:17,078 --> 00:22:18,910
<i>Allamaraine,</i> count to four

405
00:22:18,947 --> 00:22:20,245

You'll come with me

410
00:22:26,527 --> 00:22:28,155
Come on, just say the rhyme.

411

<i>Allamaraine.</i>

423
00:22:56,681 --> 00:22:58,651
Third <i>shap.</i>

424
00:23:00,388 --> 00:23:02,220
<i>Allamaraine!</i>

425
00:23:13,612 --> 00:23:17,107
I think I'm getting
the hang of this.

426
00:23:28,172 --> 00:23:29,731
Choose their path.

427
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:30,765
Path?

428
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,540
Short or long.

429
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,946
What's the difference?

430
00:23:33,982 --> 00:23:35,473
The short path
doubles the peril

431
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:36,953
to your four players.

432
00:23:36,988 --> 00:23:38,890
It also doubles your winnings.

433
00:23:38,924 --> 00:23:41,156
Doubles my winnings?
Well, in that case...

434
00:23:41,195 --> 00:23:42,527
Choose carefully.

435
00:23:42,564 --> 00:23:44,591
If none of your players
makes it home

436
00:23:44,635 --> 00:23:46,331
you lose everything you've won.

437
00:23:46,371 --> 00:23:48,364
Oh...

438
00:23:48,408 --> 00:23:51,504
I see why you find
this game so interesting.

439
00:23:51,547 --> 00:23:52,606
Do you?

440
00:23:52,649 --> 00:23:54,174
Yes.

441
00:23:54,218 --> 00:23:56,780
You know, I might have room

442
00:23:56,824 --> 00:23:59,852
for another gaming table
or two

443
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,957
on the second floor.

444
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,734
We might, uh, negotiate
a licensing agreement.

445
00:24:05,773 --> 00:24:06,934
Perhaps we could discuss...

446
00:24:06,975 --> 00:24:08,034
Quark.

447
00:24:08,111 --> 00:24:10,172
I'm busy.

448
00:24:10,214 --> 00:24:11,705
Yes, I can see.

449
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,947
When was the last time
you saw Sisko?

450
00:24:13,987 --> 00:24:15,889
Last night,
when he went home to bed.

451
00:24:15,925 --> 00:24:17,986
Did he say anything to you
about leaving the station?

452
00:24:18,028 --> 00:24:19,223
Not a thing.

453
00:24:19,263 --> 00:24:20,731
Choose their path.

454
00:24:20,767 --> 00:24:22,235
Quark!

455
00:24:22,269 --> 00:24:23,567
Really, Odo, you'll have to...

456
00:24:23,605 --> 00:24:27,066
He's missing, and so are Kira
Dax and Bashir.

457
00:24:27,111 --> 00:24:29,240
Four officers
have just disappeared.

458
00:24:29,281 --> 00:24:30,510
You're sure you have no idea?

459
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:33,077
Why would I know
anything about?

460
00:24:33,122 --> 00:24:35,422
Four?

461
00:24:35,459 --> 00:24:37,929
Did you say four officers
are missing?

462
00:24:37,964 --> 00:24:39,489
Yes.

463
00:24:40,803 --> 00:24:43,103
Double their peril...

464
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,610
double your winnings.

465
00:24:56,263 --> 00:24:59,861
Bet or leave.

466
00:24:59,903 --> 00:25:01,873
Odo...

467
00:25:01,907 --> 00:25:04,742
how about taking my place, huh?

468
00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:06,772
Choose their path.

469
00:25:07,984 --> 00:25:10,386
I'll, uh...

470
00:25:10,422 --> 00:25:12,118
take the safer path.

471
00:25:14,295 --> 00:25:17,061
Roll.

472
00:25:30,491 --> 00:25:32,961
Rhymes and riddles and mazes.

473
00:25:32,996 --> 00:25:35,296
What's the logic
behind all this?

474
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:37,303
What do they want from us?

475
00:25:37,337 --> 00:25:38,464
Move along home.

476
00:25:38,506 --> 00:25:40,635
That's what the man
told the Commander.

477
00:25:40,677 --> 00:25:42,145
A game.

478
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,810
Home is often the destination
in a game.

479
00:25:44,851 --> 00:25:46,479
The Wadi do love games.

480
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,920
Think of it.

481
00:25:47,956 --> 00:25:52,954
We've been given directions,
clues, obstacles to overcome...

482
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:56,604
Pawns.

483
00:26:08,494 --> 00:26:10,794
Excuse me...

484
00:26:10,831 --> 00:26:12,026
Excuse me...

485
00:26:14,671 --> 00:26:16,834
This has gone far enough.

486
00:26:20,348 --> 00:26:24,651
Will somebody please tell me
what is going on around here?!

487
00:26:24,689 --> 00:26:26,784
Why are you doing this to us?!

488
00:26:28,363 --> 00:26:32,462
What is wrong
with you people?!

489
00:26:32,503 --> 00:26:35,737
Madam, this is
no laughing matter.

490
00:26:38,046 --> 00:26:40,175
Don't eat or drink anything.

491
00:26:40,217 --> 00:26:42,744
Maybe it's the Wadi's way
of providing nourishment.

492
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:46,090
Or maybe it's drugged...

493
00:26:46,128 --> 00:26:47,994
or poisoned.

494
00:26:57,014 --> 00:26:58,141
Falow...

495
00:26:58,183 --> 00:26:59,344
Drink?

496
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:05,659
We're not playing anymore.

497
00:27:05,697 --> 00:27:06,995
Move along.

498
00:27:07,032 --> 00:27:08,500
Move along home.

499
00:27:08,535 --> 00:27:10,003
You brought us here.

500
00:27:10,037 --> 00:27:11,062
You take us home.

501
00:27:16,716 --> 00:27:18,014
The smoke.

502
00:27:18,051 --> 00:27:20,351
Not... bothering them.

503
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:21,857
You're hurting us.

504
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:24,384
Can't you see... that?

505
00:27:30,407 --> 00:27:31,534
Drink!

506
00:27:31,576 --> 00:27:33,067
It's the antidote.

507
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:53,681
How did you know?

508
00:27:53,716 --> 00:27:55,184
Scientific method.

509
00:27:55,218 --> 00:27:56,914
Actually, I took a guess.

510
00:27:56,954 --> 00:27:59,550
It didn't seem like
I had much to lose.

511
00:28:05,403 --> 00:28:06,496
<i>Shap...</i>

512
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:07,734
four.

513
00:28:17,525 --> 00:28:18,857
Let's go.

514
00:28:36,328 --> 00:28:37,990
<i>Allamaraine!</i>

515
00:29:05,982 --> 00:29:09,477
Now, wouldn't your scans pick up
human life-signs on their ship?

516
00:29:09,521 --> 00:29:10,921
Usually.

517
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:13,724
But we've never encountered
Wadi technology before.

518
00:29:13,762 --> 00:29:17,633
Isolate that energy flux
on their second deck.

519
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:20,835
Some kind of intense
bipolar current.

520
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:23,539
What would cause
something like that?

521
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,639
Got me.

522
00:29:24,682 --> 00:29:25,945
The only thing we've got

523
00:29:25,985 --> 00:29:28,114
that would put out
that type of current

524
00:29:28,154 --> 00:29:29,452
would be a transporter

525
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:30,651
but a transporter burst

526
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:32,557
would only last
for a few seconds.

527
00:29:32,596 --> 00:29:35,590
Huh... I think we'd
better go take a look.

528
00:29:35,634 --> 00:29:36,863
No, wait a minute, Odo!

529
00:29:36,903 --> 00:29:39,271
You can't just go
storming onto their ship

530
00:29:39,308 --> 00:29:40,674
without their permission.

531
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,873
Oh, i-i-is that
Starfleet policy?

532
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:44,143
That's right.

533
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:46,653
Well, I'm not in Starfleet.

534
00:29:46,688 --> 00:29:48,179
Set the coordinates

535
00:29:48,224 --> 00:29:51,424
to midway down
the second deck corridor.

536
00:29:53,133 --> 00:29:54,101
Uh...

537
00:29:54,135 --> 00:29:55,262
Is it against

538
00:29:55,303 --> 00:29:58,206
Starfleet policy
to press a few buttons?

539
00:30:01,815 --> 00:30:03,147
Energizing.

540
00:30:39,416 --> 00:30:40,941
Choose their path.

541
00:30:40,986 --> 00:30:43,684
No! This game is finished
right now.

542
00:30:43,724 --> 00:30:45,022
Stop the game

543
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,028
lose your players.

544
00:30:46,062 --> 00:30:47,030
Odo...

545
00:30:47,063 --> 00:30:48,361
just stay out of it.

546
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:49,458
Quark!

547
00:30:49,501 --> 00:30:52,028
I'm doing fine;
they're doing fine.

548
00:30:52,072 --> 00:30:53,802
Choose their path.

549
00:30:53,842 --> 00:30:57,178
Double their peril,
double your winnings.

550
00:30:59,018 --> 00:31:00,714
Quark!

551
00:31:00,754 --> 00:31:01,744
Fine, fine!

552
00:31:01,789 --> 00:31:03,884
The safer path.

553
00:31:03,927 --> 00:31:06,420
Roll.

554
00:31:14,412 --> 00:31:18,647
An unfortunate roll.

555
00:31:21,225 --> 00:31:22,693
Isn't it simply a matter

556
00:31:22,727 --> 00:31:24,754
of figuring out
how to win this game?

557
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:25,993
Simply?

558
00:31:26,034 --> 00:31:27,798
I don't think we have
any other choice.

559
00:31:27,903 --> 00:31:30,032
Well, seriously, we've gone
from the second <i>shap</i>

560
00:31:30,074 --> 00:31:32,340
to the third <i>shap</i>
to the fourth <i>shap</i> already.

561
00:31:32,378 --> 00:31:33,368
What is a <i>shap?</i>

562
00:31:33,414 --> 00:31:34,746
I have no idea

563
00:31:34,783 --> 00:31:36,810
but we're making progress,
whatever it is.

564
00:31:36,852 --> 00:31:38,947
We're playing
for our lives here, Doctor.

565
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:41,358
I don't think you're taking this
very seriously.

566
00:31:41,394 --> 00:31:43,022
On the contrary, Major.

567
00:31:43,064 --> 00:31:45,057
I find the stakes
to be highly motivating.

568
00:31:46,103 --> 00:31:47,731
Listen.

569
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:51,643
I'm reading high
magnetic field variations.

570
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:54,172
Intense flux patterns.

571
00:31:54,217 --> 00:31:55,845
It's coming toward us.

572
00:31:55,886 --> 00:31:57,650
Find cover if you can.

573
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,835
Falow!

574
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,878
Next move.

575
00:32:48,916 --> 00:32:50,680
What happened to that one?

576
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:51,687
Why is it there?

577
00:32:51,721 --> 00:32:53,087
Next move.

578
00:32:53,123 --> 00:32:54,318
Choose your path.

579
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:55,384
Listen to me.

580
00:32:55,427 --> 00:32:56,986
I want that player back!

581
00:32:57,030 --> 00:33:00,662
If you would care to play
the game after he's done

582
00:33:00,703 --> 00:33:02,296
it can be arranged.

583
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,706
Choose their path.

584
00:33:03,743 --> 00:33:06,680
Double their peril,
double your winnings.

585
00:33:06,714 --> 00:33:08,148
Give me the shortcut.

586
00:33:08,183 --> 00:33:09,310
The shortcut?!

587
00:33:09,352 --> 00:33:10,320
It's the right thing to do.

588
00:33:10,354 --> 00:33:11,253
Are you crazy?!

589
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:12,484
Double the stakes.

590
00:33:12,525 --> 00:33:13,584
Wait!

591
00:33:13,627 --> 00:33:15,061
I know what I'm doing.

592
00:33:15,096 --> 00:33:16,325
I've spent my life

593
00:33:16,365 --> 00:33:18,163
figuring the odds
on all sorts of games.

594
00:33:18,201 --> 00:33:20,171
Now, I'm just learning
this one, that's true

595
00:33:20,205 --> 00:33:22,368
but I know this
is the right move.

596
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:24,003
The right move
to make you rich.

597
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:25,013
More than that.

598
00:33:25,047 --> 00:33:26,983
Look at the board.

599
00:33:27,017 --> 00:33:31,013
The shortcut skips
a whole level.

600
00:33:31,058 --> 00:33:35,088
I've learned there are risks
in every roll of the dice.

601
00:33:35,132 --> 00:33:39,037
This way, they can advance
all the way home

602
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:41,599
on just one move.

603
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:44,615
Trust a gambler.

604
00:33:49,357 --> 00:33:51,121
Roll.

605
00:33:55,469 --> 00:33:56,732
What?

606
00:33:56,771 --> 00:33:58,399
Blow on them.

607
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,203
Would you please just?

608
00:33:59,242 --> 00:34:01,006
Blow on them.

609
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,464
<i>Thialo.</i>

610
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,468
What?

611
00:34:13,501 --> 00:34:14,901
What does it mean?

612
00:34:15,004 --> 00:34:17,133
Sacrifice one

613
00:34:17,174 --> 00:34:20,270
so that two may live.

614
00:34:32,702 --> 00:34:34,763
You can't ask him to do that.

615
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:38,643
If you do not sacrifice one,
all three will be lost.

616
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,946
I can't. Please.

617
00:34:40,983 --> 00:34:42,246
Which player?

618
00:34:42,286 --> 00:34:46,282
I don't even know
which one is which.

619
00:34:46,327 --> 00:34:49,423
Select one to be sacrificed,
or this game is finished!

620
00:34:49,465 --> 00:34:51,958
Fine! Fine!

621
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:55,907
Fine. Fine.

622
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:09,159
I can't do it.

623
00:35:09,201 --> 00:35:10,669
I beg of you.

624
00:35:10,704 --> 00:35:12,833
A terrible mistake
has been made.

625
00:35:12,874 --> 00:35:15,367
This is all a misunderstanding.

626
00:35:15,412 --> 00:35:17,382
Please.

627
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:20,148
I-I've learned my lesson.

628
00:35:20,188 --> 00:35:21,656
I'll never cheat again.

629
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:24,958
I'll never cheat again!

630
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:26,795
Please!

631
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,395
Just don't make me do this.

632
00:35:29,437 --> 00:35:31,805
Anything but this.

633
00:35:31,842 --> 00:35:37,375
Please! Please!

634
00:35:37,419 --> 00:35:40,322
Please!

635
00:35:40,357 --> 00:35:41,985
Oh!

636
00:35:44,798 --> 00:35:47,735
Plea...

637
00:35:52,211 --> 00:35:54,511
Oh, please, please.

638
00:35:54,549 --> 00:35:55,881
Very well.

639
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,929
I don't have to sacrifice
one of them?

640
00:36:02,964 --> 00:36:05,161
No. You do not.

641
00:36:09,743 --> 00:36:13,273
We'll program the game
to select one at random.

642
00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:16,012
Final wagers.

643
00:36:17,391 --> 00:36:18,484
Last move.

644
00:36:22,965 --> 00:36:24,935
We should have eaten
something at the party

645
00:36:24,969 --> 00:36:26,460
when we had the chance.

646
00:36:26,505 --> 00:36:28,269
Commander Sisko!

647
00:36:28,308 --> 00:36:29,367
Doctor.

648
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:31,312
Over here! Hurry!

649
00:36:31,347 --> 00:36:32,906
Where's it coming from?

650
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,248
Spread out.

651
00:36:34,285 --> 00:36:35,753
I can see it!

652
00:36:35,788 --> 00:36:38,281
I found the way home!

653
00:36:39,963 --> 00:36:42,559
Over here.
I found an open door.

654
00:36:42,601 --> 00:36:43,933
Come on, Dax!

655
00:36:45,806 --> 00:36:47,001
Julian!

656
00:36:47,042 --> 00:36:48,772
Hurry up!

657
00:36:48,812 --> 00:36:51,078
Julian, are you all right?

658
00:36:54,388 --> 00:36:55,913
Dax!

659
00:36:55,957 --> 00:36:58,826
Ah! My leg.

660
00:37:02,837 --> 00:37:04,739
Don't move.

661
00:37:04,773 --> 00:37:06,537
Nothing's broken.

662
00:37:06,577 --> 00:37:08,604
What's taking so long?

663
00:37:08,647 --> 00:37:10,275
We're almost out of here.

664
00:37:10,317 --> 00:37:11,615
Can't you see it?

665
00:37:11,653 --> 00:37:12,643
Doctor.

666
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:15,488
We need some help.

667
00:37:15,526 --> 00:37:17,928
Dax is hurt.

668
00:37:22,371 --> 00:37:24,169
<i>Thialo.</i>

669
00:37:24,209 --> 00:37:26,679
Move along home.

670
00:37:26,713 --> 00:37:27,942
<i>Shap...</i>

671
00:37:27,982 --> 00:37:29,678
six.

672
00:37:31,789 --> 00:37:34,726
I'm reading a tectonic shift
of two ground masses.

673
00:37:34,761 --> 00:37:36,890
We are directly
over the fault line.

674
00:37:36,931 --> 00:37:38,331
The cavern wall structure

675
00:37:38,367 --> 00:37:40,530
has been significantly
weakened by the stress.

676
00:37:40,571 --> 00:37:42,199
It's not going
to hold much longer.

677
00:37:42,241 --> 00:37:44,302
See if you can put
some weight on it.

678
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:47,780
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

679
00:39:02,318 --> 00:39:04,082
I'll never make it across.

680
00:39:04,122 --> 00:39:05,681
There's got to be
a way around this.

681
00:39:05,724 --> 00:39:07,819
Benjamin, you and Kira
can make that jump.

682
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:09,831
We're not leaving you here.

683
00:39:09,865 --> 00:39:10,992
This cavern is going to collapse

684
00:39:11,034 --> 00:39:12,434
and kill all of us
if you don't go now.

685
00:39:13,906 --> 00:39:15,967
Seven lives is more
than enough for a Trill.

686
00:39:16,009 --> 00:39:18,377
You haven't even finished one.

687
00:39:18,414 --> 00:39:20,246
How could I live out that life

688
00:39:20,284 --> 00:39:22,379
knowing I left you behind,
old man?

689
00:39:22,421 --> 00:39:23,753
Don't let sentiment
get in the way...

690
00:39:23,791 --> 00:39:25,487
...of command decisions.
- Of command decisions.

691
00:39:25,527 --> 00:39:29,728
Yeah.
I've heard that one somewhere.

692
00:39:33,607 --> 00:39:36,442
If you were hurt...

693
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,575
I'd leave you behind.

694
00:39:38,616 --> 00:39:41,382
Then I'm glad I'm not
the one who's hurt.

695
00:39:41,422 --> 00:39:42,515
Major.

696
00:39:42,558 --> 00:39:45,792
Major, you go across.

697
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:48,130
We'll find a way around.

698
00:39:51,607 --> 00:39:54,203
We'll be all right.

699
00:39:56,181 --> 00:39:58,651
Major, I gave you
a direct order.

700
00:39:58,686 --> 00:39:59,915
Court-martial me.

701
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,924
I can't.
You're not in Starfleet.

702
00:40:02,026 --> 00:40:03,928
If I were a superior officer

703
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:06,193
I'd court-martial both of you.

704
00:40:56,424 --> 00:40:58,052
Oh!

705
00:41:27,445 --> 00:41:29,608
Only a few meters more.

706
00:42:04,512 --> 00:42:06,448
Hang on!

707
00:42:08,921 --> 00:42:11,983
Benjamin!

708
00:42:20,708 --> 00:42:22,176
They made it!

709
00:42:22,211 --> 00:42:23,509
I won.

710
00:42:23,546 --> 00:42:26,210
I had full confidence
in you, Commander.

711
00:42:26,251 --> 00:42:28,221
There wasn't a moment's doubt

712
00:42:28,255 --> 00:42:30,555
that you would prevail
in this outrageous...

713
00:42:30,593 --> 00:42:32,118
No, Quark.

714
00:42:33,564 --> 00:42:37,401
I'm afraid all your players
were lost.

715
00:42:37,438 --> 00:42:39,465
What? You mean...

716
00:42:39,509 --> 00:42:42,537
we were never
in any real danger?

717
00:42:44,618 --> 00:42:47,111
It's only a game.

718
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,668
Time to move along home.

719
00:42:59,712 --> 00:43:01,010
Not so fast.

720
00:43:01,047 --> 00:43:03,313
This may all have
been a game to you

721
00:43:03,352 --> 00:43:06,152
but we take First Contact
with a new species

722
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:07,488
very seriously

723
00:43:07,525 --> 00:43:08,823
and I don't appreciate...

724
00:43:08,861 --> 00:43:10,056
Excuse me, Commander.

725
00:43:10,163 --> 00:43:11,062
Yes, Odo.

726
00:43:11,165 --> 00:43:13,465
Before you blame them

727
00:43:13,503 --> 00:43:16,474
you might want to ask Quark

728
00:43:16,509 --> 00:43:18,479
just how this all started.

729
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,846
Quark.

730
00:43:20,883 --> 00:43:23,046
I wish I could explain it.

731
00:43:23,087 --> 00:43:27,528
Uh... they just had
a run of bad luck

732
00:43:27,561 --> 00:43:29,052
and then they blamed
me for their losses.

733
00:43:29,098 --> 00:43:30,066
And, uh...

734
00:43:30,099 --> 00:43:31,499
That's not what you said

735
00:43:31,536 --> 00:43:34,439
when you were groveling
on the floor.

736
00:43:34,474 --> 00:43:37,001
Oh, that's right.

737
00:43:37,045 --> 00:43:39,106
You were here for the groveling.

738
00:43:39,216 --> 00:43:40,343
Uh...

739
00:43:40,385 --> 00:43:44,078
You said something
about cheating, didn't you?

740
00:43:44,211 --> 00:43:45,474
Cheating?

741
00:43:45,513 --> 00:43:48,143
I would have said anything
to end the ordeal.

742
00:43:48,185 --> 00:43:50,519
It was too much for me to bear.

743
00:43:50,556 --> 00:43:51,819
You have no idea

744
00:43:51,858 --> 00:43:54,989
the pressure I was under,
Commander.

745
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:58,400
If you will excuse us...

746
00:43:58,436 --> 00:44:00,906
Perhaps someday...

747
00:44:00,941 --> 00:44:02,466
a rematch.

748
00:44:07,219 --> 00:44:09,553
You know...

749
00:44:09,623 --> 00:44:12,185
this game could work here.

750
00:44:14,499 --> 00:44:17,129
It really could.

751
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:18,661
Excuse me.

752
00:44:18,706 --> 00:44:20,004
Falow?

753
00:44:20,042 --> 00:44:22,569
Uh, Mr. Falow?

754
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,909
A word with you, sir.

755
00:44:23,949 --> 00:44:25,542
What's your hurry?

756
00:44:25,585 --> 00:44:28,351
I think you'll like this.

757
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:31,293
Mr. Falow!
