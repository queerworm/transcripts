1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,838
Miles, fancy a drink?

2
00:00:03,838 --> 00:00:05,631
I can‘t.
Keiko and the kids

3
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:07,132
are waiting on me for dinner.

4
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:08,843
Next Thursday--
book a holosuite.

5
00:00:08,843 --> 00:00:10,218
They‘re going to Bajor.

6
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:12,972
Hi, Julian.

7
00:00:12,972 --> 00:00:15,223
Hi.
You going to Vic‘s?

8
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:16,391
Yes.

9
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,310
Mind if I join?

10
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,229
Uh... actually, we
were looking forward

11
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:23,357
to spending
an evening alone.

12
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,108
Great.

13
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,068
Well, have a great time.

14
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:30,489
I understand.

15
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,710
Cheeky virus.

16
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,128
You‘ve gone and mutated on me.

17
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:50,342
Well, you can run,
but you can‘t hide.

18
00:00:58,225 --> 00:00:59,977
Lights.

19
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,773
Nog to Dr. Bashir.

20
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,150
Go ahead.

21
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,904
You‘re needed
in the Infirmary, sir.

22
00:01:09,904 --> 00:01:11,947
It‘s 3:00 in the morning.

23
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:14,366
Isn‘t Dr. Girani on duty?

24
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:15,784
Not anymore.

25
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,828
Admiral Patrick threw her out.

26
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:20,581
Admiral who?

27
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:23,417
He wants to see you
immediately, sir.

28
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:25,084
On my way.

29
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:30,799
(<i> door opens</i> )

30
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,092
What‘s going on, Ensign?

31
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:34,428
Sir, Admiral Patrick
and his staff

32
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:35,763
just arrived
on the<i> Farragut.</i>

33
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,180
What happened
to Dr. Girani?

34
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,432
The Admiral said
she was asking

35
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,350
too many stupid
questions.

36
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,273
Dr. Bashir reporting
as ordered.

37
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:47,733
Finally.

38
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:50,611
Patrick?!

39
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:51,904
That‘s Admiral Patrick.

40
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:53,739
Mind your manners,
Doctor.

41
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:54,990
What are you
doing here?

42
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,784
That‘s a stupid question.

43
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:58,786
Where did you get
those uniforms?

44
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:00,955
That‘s a stupid question, too.

45
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:02,623
Please excuse
the doctor, sir.

46
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,041
He just woke up.

47
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,001
They‘re not
Starfleet officers, Nog.

48
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:07,502
They‘re not?

49
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,921
We‘re mutants.

50
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:10,839
Genetically
engineered mutants.

51
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,758
Can‘t you tell?

52
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,593
BASHIR: Does anybody
at the Institute
know you‘re missing?

53
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:17,429
That‘s a stupid...
Will you stop saying that!

54
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:18,973
Why are you
so upset?

55
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:21,100
You wanted Sarina
brought here. Well...

56
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,602
here she is.

57
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:25,562
(<i> sighs</i> )

58
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,107
I was considering bringing
Sarina here for treatment

59
00:02:28,107 --> 00:02:29,900
when I was ready,

60
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,819
but I still have to modify
my surgical equipment

61
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,487
before I can begin
the procedure.

62
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,030
Well, don‘t worry--
we‘ll help you.

63
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,490
And when we‘re through
with Sarina,

64
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,325
she will be just like us.

65
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,577
Do you have any idea

66
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,038
how much trouble you could
get into for impersonating
Starfleet officers?

67
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:45,165
Jack, you didn‘t say
anything about us
getting into trouble.

68
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,458
Well, we didn‘t get
caught, did we?

69
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,209
Didn‘t anybody
question you?

70
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,796
Of course. But when they did,
Patrick would say...

71
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:52,673
That‘s a stupid...

72
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,342
You‘d be surprised
how well it works.

73
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:56,677
I‘ll say.

74
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,012
What are they
going do to us?

75
00:02:58,012 --> 00:02:59,178
Oh, it‘s all right.

76
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:00,681
I‘ll find a way

77
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,642
to straighten this
out... somehow.

78
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,939
Hello, Sarina.
Remember me?

79
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,399
Of course
she remembers you.
She‘s not an idiot.

80
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,276
She‘s just a little
cataleptic.

81
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:16,195
Are you really
going to be able
to make her better?

82
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:19,825
I‘m going to do
everything I can.

83
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:21,576
I promise.

84
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,614
They posed as an Admiral
and his staff.

85
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:24,908
If you want me to convince
Starfleet not to press charges,

86
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:27,286
you‘re going to have to give me
a damn good reason.

87
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:29,246
They wanted
to bring Sarina here
so that I could help her.

88
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,331
They meant well.
They meant well?

89
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,667
That‘s the same
excuse you gave me
when they were caught

90
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,170
trying to pass military
secrets to the Dominion.

91
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,462
They were trying
to save lives...

92
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,047
Doctor, I appreciate

93
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,966
that you feel a
connection to them

94
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,135
because you are genetically
engineered yourself,

95
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:46,221
but they have displayed
a consistent disregard
for the rules

96
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,307
that the rest of
society lives by.

97
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:51,310
Maybe that‘s because
they‘re not allowed
to live in society.

98
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,936
We are not here
to debate Federation policy

99
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,980
toward
the genetically enhanced.

100
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,232
We are here to discuss
what to do about these people

101
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:58,775
now that they‘re aboard.

102
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,777
Of course.

103
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,612
Well, with your
permission, sir,

104
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,448
I would like to proceed
with Sarina‘s treatment.

105
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:08,702
I take it the Institute
has given the approval
to move forward?

106
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:12,039
A copy of the medical
protocols I submitted.

107
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,082
Dr. Loews,
Sarina‘s legal guardian,

108
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,210
has given her consent.

109
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,921
Well, it appears that
this procedure has never
been done before.

110
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,840
Well, there‘s no guarantee
that it will work, of course,

111
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,967
but if it does, it could change
everything for her.

112
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,303
There‘s no reason
to think that she‘s suffering

113
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,056
from the same type
of behavioral disorders
as Jack and the others.

114
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,516
Her problem is that she‘s
trapped inside her own mind.

115
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,476
This could free her.

116
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,603
There are still a few technical
issues I have to work on,

117
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:38,523
but I feel confident
that I can iron them all out.

118
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:42,277
You‘ve put in a lot of time
on this, haven‘t you?

119
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,071
I owe it to her, sir.

120
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,947
I could have ended up
the same way as Sarina,

121
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,407
but I was lucky.
My DNA re-sequencing

122
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:51,203
didn‘t have
any unintended side effects.

123
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,706
All right, Doctor.

124
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:57,709
I‘ll take care of Starfleet.
You take care of Sarina.

125
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,502
Thank you, sir.
I‘ll arrange to have

126
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,713
the rest of the people
sent back to the Institute.

127
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:04,966
Actually, I was hoping
you‘d allow them to stay
on for awhile.

128
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,551
For what reason?

129
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,220
Sarina‘s spent the last
15 years with them.

130
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,888
Now, assuming
the procedure works

131
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,932
and she comes out
of her isolation,

132
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,475
I think it would be
helpful to have some
familiar faces around.

133
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:17,396
Well, we‘ll arrange
for quarters

134
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:18,980
to be set up in
the cargo bay.

135
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,815
I appreciate it.

136
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,319
Just make sure
they stay there.

137
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,988
I don‘t want them to get
out and cause trouble
like they did the last time.

138
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,823
I‘ll see that it
doesn‘t happen again.

139
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,868
I‘ll hold you to that.
One thing more.

140
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,578
Get them out
of those uniforms.

141
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,871
Aye, sir.

142
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,792
There. Don‘t you
look pretty?

143
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,168
JACK:
Why are we doing
this anyway?

144
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,378
PATRICK:
Keep going.

145
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:42,754
JACK:
Here?

146
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,672
A little to the left.

147
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,968
That‘s not where
it was last time.

148
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,594
Oh, what difference
does it make?

149
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,264
He‘s right.
Fine.

150
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:53,348
How‘s that?

151
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,016
Much better.

152
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,684
Here he is!

153
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,353
Well, well, what did
the Captain say?

154
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:00,563
All systems are a go.
See? See?

155
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,399
I told you it was a good
idea to bring her here.

156
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,775
That‘s right, Jack,
I remember.

157
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,402
So, when do
we operate?

158
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:06,861
We?

159
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,696
You‘re going to
need some help.

160
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:09,906
Oh, so you‘re
a surgeon now?

161
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,283
How hard
can it be?

162
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:12,993
Um, thanks
for the offer, but...

163
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,412
Oh, I get it.
You want to take
all the credit.

164
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:18,290
It‘s not about credit.
It‘s about what‘s best
for Sarina, I think.

165
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:22,294
Fine. I‘m busy, anyway.
New project.

166
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:24,254
Oh, glad to hear it.
What are you working on?

167
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:27,341
Wouldn‘t you
like to know?
(<i> chuckling</i> )

168
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:29,676
Well, I‘ll leave you to it,
but, uh, do me a favor

169
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,346
and, uh, change out
of those uniforms.

170
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:43,690
Sarina, I‘d like to take
you to the Infirmary
and run a few tests.

171
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,150
Is that all right?

172
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,028
She‘s afraid it‘s going to hurt.

173
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,364
It won‘t hurt.
I promise.

174
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,366
You‘re in good hands...

175
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,409
very good hands.

176
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,287
Don‘t get your
hopes up, Julian.

177
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,247
It‘s over
between the two of us.

178
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,708
I have a new man in my life...

179
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,378
that gorgeous
little Ferengi.

180
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:07,297
Nog?
Jealous?

181
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,757
Oh, that‘s so sweet.

182
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,222
Hurry back.

183
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,313
BASHIR:
Sarina‘s cerebral cortex
was genetically enhanced

184
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:27,317
in order to accelerate
the rate at which she can
process information.

185
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:30,404
Now, the only problem is,
her visual and auditory systems

186
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:33,114
can‘t channel the stimuli
into the cortex fast enough,

187
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,949
so, because
they‘re out of sync

188
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,160
she can‘t focus on
what‘s going on around her.

189
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,620
Well, is there any way
to get her sensory
processors up to speed?

190
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,333
I need to stimulate
the growth of new synapses
in the thalamus,

191
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,503
which means...
I have to manipulate

192
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,089
neural proteins
at a subatomic level.

193
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,049
Well, then you‘ve
got a problem.

194
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:54,094
This is the most advanced
neocortical probe made,

195
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,012
and it‘s not nearly
that accurate.

196
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,306
Now you know why
I asked you down here.

197
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,807
Well, I wish I could
help you, Julian,

198
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,851
but at resolutions
that small,

199
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,979
quantum fluctuations are
impossible to control,

200
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,190
and I can‘t make this
thing any more accurate.

201
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,734
How can you say that before
you‘ve even tried it?

202
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:13,363
I‘m sorry, Julian.
It-it-it can‘t be done.
I‘m sorry.

203
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,698
Well, sorry just isn‘t
good enough, Miles.

204
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:19,244
This is Sarina‘s
only chance at living
a normal life.

205
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,788
Julian, I can‘t break
the laws of physics.

206
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,331
Nobody can.

207
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,802
Your friend was right.

JACK:
We recalibrated
the imaging diodes.

211
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:47,188
It is so accurate
that you could clip
the wings of an angel

Anything.

221

It doesn‘t matter
how small.

222
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,426
It‘s been five days now,

223

as unresponsive

224
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,221
as she was before
the procedure.

225
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:44,847
I know you‘re
disappointed, Julian,

226
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,683
but you did everything
that you could.

227
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,685
Well, it
wasn‘t enough.

I‘m sorry.

229

Obviously, you want
to punish yourself.

Do you want help?

231
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,278
Because I‘m really good
at punishing myself.

I‘d be kicking myself

234

for getting
people‘s hopes up,

235

enough to think
that I could help Sarina,

236
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:12,041
even though dozens
of other doctors have failed.

237
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,293
Should I

238
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,835
No.

That‘s a little odd.

Her norepinephrine levels
are slightly elevated.

264
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:06,989
What‘s causing it?
I‘m not sure.

265
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:10,910
It‘s probably due to
limbic overcompensation.

266
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,620
The levels should drop

267
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,290
when the new thalamic
connections stabilize.

351
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,690
It was amazing.
Within a few minutes,
Sarina‘s voice just took off.

352
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,819
That kind of improvement
usually takes weeks
of speech therapy.

353
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,029
That is amazing.
Julian...

354
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:17,197
So, she was exhausted.
I took her back
to the Infirmary.

355
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,533
I needed to monitor her neural
activity anyway while she slept,

356
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,744
but I still can‘t get
over that transformation.

357
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,579
Yesterday, she was
silent as a stone.

358
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,748
Today, she‘s singing
and laughing...

359
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,500
You should have seen her, Miles.

360
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,503
How could I? I‘ve been
sitting here all night.

361
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,546
Is it Thursday?

362
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:35,883
Well, why else would I
be sitting here all night?

363
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,385
Oh...
I‘m sorry. I forgot.

364
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,929
It‘s all right.

365
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:46,144
Morn caught me up
on how his 17 brothers
and sisters are doing.

366
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:49,063
I‘d better head off.
I got an early start
in the morning.

367
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:51,398
Oh, I‘m sorry
about the mix-up, Miles.

368
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,900
Mmm.

369
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,652
It‘s all right.

370
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,656
I‘m happy for her.

371
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:01,241
Happy for both of you.

372
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,330
(<i> humming softly</i> )

373
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,876
Sarina.

374
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,962
What are you doing here?
How did you get in?

375
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:14,547
It wasn‘t hard.

376
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,175
Your access code
only has six digits.

377
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:19,301
Is something wrong?

378
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,179
I-I couldn‘t sleep.

379
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,684
My nurse could have given
you something for that.

380
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:29,729
I... don‘t want
to sleep.

381
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,105
Why not?

382
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:34,567
What if I wake up
the way I was?

383
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,110
What if I can‘t...

384
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,406
It‘s not going to happen.

385
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:43,159
Your life‘s going
to be different now.

386
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:47,038
Your future...

387
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:50,083
is full of possibilities.

388
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:55,004
You know, you‘re going
to be doing things

389
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:58,674
that you haven‘t
even dreamed of.

390
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,719
There‘s really no
reason to be afraid.

391
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,184
Sarina?

392
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:15,149
(<i> sighs</i> )

393
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:42,843
Good morning.
Morning.

394
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,387
You didn‘t account
for the L-Two codon.

395
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:46,847
What?

396
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,766
That‘s why
the virus mutated.

397
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:51,602
You need to target
the RNA transcriptor.

398
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:53,353
Hungry?

399
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,357
The L-Two codon...

400
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,777
Of course.

401
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:01,612
Why didn‘t I
think of that?

402
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,698
Sarina...

403
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,867
you‘re amazing.

404
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,995
I‘ve been working
on this for months.

405
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:11,330
You would have seen it
sooner or later.

406
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:15,001
I don‘t know about that.

407
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:16,627
Thank you.

408
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:19,297
I‘m glad I could do
something for you.

409
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:21,674
You‘ve done so much for me.

410
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:25,178
NURSE:
Infirmary to Dr. Bashir.
Go ahead.

411
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:28,346
Dr. Girani is asking for
your assistance in surgery, sir.

412
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:30,557
I‘m on my way.

413
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:33,936
Well, looks like I‘m
going to be tied up
for the next few hours.

414
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:35,938
What would you like
to do in the meantime?

415
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,564
Would you like a
tour of the station?

416
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,233
I can ask Ezri
to show you around.

417
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:40,776
That‘s all right.

418
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,653
I think I‘ll go see Jack
and the others.

419
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:45,198
All right.
I‘ll have someone take
you to the cargo bay,

420
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:48,075
and when I‘m finished
with surgery
I‘ll join you there.

421
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,953
Oh, wait. You need
your breakfast.

422
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,129
Thank you.

423
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:10,931
The fact is, is that
the universe is going
to stop expanding,

424
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,933
and it is going
to collapse in on itself.

425
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,935
We‘ve got to do something
before it‘s too late.

426
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,520
How much time
do we have left?

427
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,189
60 trillion years--
70 at the most.

428
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:20,149
Oh, no!

429
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:22,318
Isn‘t Nog handsome?

430
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:27,614
What are
you doing?!

431
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:30,034
We are running
out of time!

432
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:32,286
Sarina! Thank God.

433
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:34,997
Nobody else around here
ever listens to me.

434
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:37,250
What is it, Jack?
What‘s wrong?

435
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:41,087
There‘s too much matter.
The universe is too heavy
for its own good.

436
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:43,421
You need
to lighten the load.

437
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:46,633
Yes, yes, yes, exactly.
We have to find some way
to decrease the mass.

438
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,302
Of the entire
universe?

439
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:51,264
That‘s the whole<i> point.</i>
<i>Is that possible?</i>

440
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:53,140
That‘s what we‘re trying
to figure out, Sarina.

441
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,018
What if we found a way
to manipulate subspace?

442
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:59,397
Mmm... hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm.
Change the cosmological
constant.

443
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:01,941
Mmm. Yes, yes, yes.
That‘d do the trick.

444
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:05,485
You can‘t change
the cosmological constant.

445
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:08,906
You know something,
Sarina, we are trying

446
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:10,908
to save existence
as we know it,

447
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:13,244
and all you can
do is criticize.

448
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:14,620
I‘m sorry.

449
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,622
Thank you!
Now, where were we?

450
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,040
PATRICK:
Manipulating
subspace.

451
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,334
JACK:
Right, right.

452
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:21,919
(<i> sighs</i> )

453
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:38,227
Doctor!

454
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:42,731
Glad you‘re here.
Is she all right?

455
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:45,443
Sarina, are you
all right?

456
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:48,237
She‘s fine.

457
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:50,906
Listen, you have to talk
to Starfleet for us.

458
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,117
We need subspace
field generators-- lots of them.

459
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:54,827
Can we talk
about it later?

460
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:57,955
Later? There isn‘t going
to be a "later" later.

461
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:03,794
JACK:
Now, once we get the
field generators...

462
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:05,545
Sarina?

463
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,506
Hi.

464
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:10,468
Is something wrong?

465
00:25:10,468 --> 00:25:14,013
Oh, no. They‘re used
to my being quiet.

466
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,722
It‘s easier this way.

467
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,810
LAUREN:
Could be very messy.

468
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:22,855
Um... some of my friends
want to get together

469
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,815
a little later on
at Quark‘s,

470
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:27,276
and I was wondering
if you‘d like to come along.

471
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,069
Me?

472
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,654
Do you want to?

473
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:33,157
JACK:
When should we be ready?

474
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:34,492
Uh...

475
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:36,494
Oh, we‘re not
invited, Jack.

476
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:37,828
Just her.

477
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:38,954
Figures.

478
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,331
That doesn‘t
seem fair.

479
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:42,958
LAUREN:
It‘s all right.

480
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,043
Come on, Sarina.

481
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:46,086
Let‘s get you dressed.

482
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,400
LAUREN:
Sorry to keep
you waiting.

483
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,942
Come on out.

484
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,277
Come on.

485
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:16,283
Am I good,
or am I good?

486
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:24,208
Look at all the people.

487
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,508
Here they are.

488
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,428
I don‘t remember
her being so...

489
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:37,595
Beautiful.
Yeah.

490
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:39,597
Everyone,
this is Sarina.

491
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:40,807
Sarina,
this is everyone.

492
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:42,600
Odo.
Nerys.

493
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,228
I‘m Miles.

494
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:45,645
I remember you.

495
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,398
You‘re Julian‘s
best friend.

496
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:50,568
Well... we get on
all right.

497
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:52,694
For the most part.

498
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,821
Why are you pretending
that it‘s not true?

499
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:58,534
Because they‘re men,
and men have trouble
expressing their feelings.

500
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:01,619
You don‘t.

501
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:03,038
Oh, are you kidding?

502
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,873
Odo never talks
about his feelings.

503
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,750
He took your hand.

504
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,668
He‘s showing you
his feelings.

505
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:11,422
Thank you.

506
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:13,757
Julian, why don‘t
you show everybody
how much you love me

507
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:16,135
and order
the next round.

508
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,344
(<i> chuckles</i> )

509
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,512
(<i> chuckles</i> )

510
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:19,846
Hey, Broik.

511
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,391
I liked your friends--

512
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:24,184
all of them.

513
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:27,271
If I had to find
someone to replace Atlas

514
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:30,316
and hold up the world,
it‘d be Miles.

515
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:32,985
He‘d do it with
a smile, too.

516
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:36,155
And Kira-- she never
doubts herself,

517
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:37,823
which is what Odo
finds so fascinating,

518
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:40,242
because he doubts
everything<i> but</i> her.

519
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:42,369
What about Ezri?

520
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:45,038
The day she realizes
she‘s more than just
the sum of her parts,

521
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,790
she‘s really going
to be something.

522
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,459
I can‘t believe
you saw all that

523
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:50,336
after just a few
hours with them.

524
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:52,670
I‘m going to have to start
putting on my poker face.

525
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,048
Too late. You‘ve already
given yourself away.

526
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:58,636
Is that right?
And how would you
describe me?

527
00:27:58,636 --> 00:28:00,179
Compassionate,

528
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:01,805
brilliant,

529
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,890
lonely.

530
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,268
Well. Two out of
three isn‘t bad.

531
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:07,645
Which two?

532
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:09,687
Now, that would
be telling.

533
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:13,609
I‘m glad you
liked my friends.

534
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:15,819
I know they liked you.

535
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,904
I felt so comfortable
around them.

536
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:20,574
I didn‘t have to worry
that someone was going
to throw a tantrum

537
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:22,451
or break into tears
all of a sudden.

538
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:25,078
They only usually
do <i> that</i> at
staff meetings.

539
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,207
Jack‘s always talking

540
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:30,876
about how we‘re better
than normal people.

541
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,587
He says that‘s why
they keep us locked up,

542
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:36,465
but he‘s wrong.

543
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:38,258
He couldn‘t get by
in the real world.

544
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,553
He‘d get himself
into too much trouble.

545
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:42,346
So would Lauren
and Patrick.

546
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:45,391
That‘s why they belong
in the Institute.

547
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:47,560
In fact, Doctor Loews wants
me to get them back there

548
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,186
as soon as possible.

549
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:52,356
I‘m not going
with them, am I?

550
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:54,774
You don‘t belong there...

551
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:56,485
not anymore.

552
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,863
Do they know?
Not yet.

553
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:03,909
They‘ve been like
a family to me

554
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,619
for as long as I
can remember.

555
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:07,913
I know how much
you care about them.

556
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,832
As difficult as they
can be sometimes,

557
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:13,001
I‘m going to miss them.

558
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:16,422
We had our own little world,
just the four of us.

559
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:21,093
So what‘s a genetically
enhanced girl supposed to do

560
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:23,429
when she wakes up
from a long sleep?

561
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,974
Point to one of those little
specks of light out there,

562
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:32,187
pack a bag and go make
a life for herself?

563
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:35,023
Why does she have to go
anywhere at all?

564
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:56,253
Sarina isn‘t going back
to the Institute with you.

565
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:58,213
She‘s not?
No, she‘s staying here.

566
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:01,467
Oh, really? Huh.
How nice for you.

567
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,677
I‘ve arranged for her
to have her own quarters.

568
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:05,304
We‘re never going
to see her again.

569
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:07,013
You have no right to
do this-- no right.

570
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,474
Look, I know you‘re
going to miss her,

571
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:10,601
but it‘s the best thing
for Sarina.

572
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:12,227
We did not help you
so you could take
her away from us.

573
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,104
Stop thinking about
yourself for a second,

574
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:16,022
Jack, and think about her.

575
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,983
Face it. She doesn‘t
belong with you anymore.

576
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:20,110
Why? Because
we‘re not normal?

577
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:22,154
Because we‘re crazy?
Oh, Jack.

578
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:24,531
Couldn‘t you make us normal
like you did for Sarina

579
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,074
and then we could
all stay together?

580
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,534
Go on, Julian.
Tell them.

581
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,161
There‘s nothing
you can do for<i> us.</i>

582
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,663
We‘re too far gone.

583
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,624
Ah, who wants to
be normal anyway?

584
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:35,751
We‘re better
than they are.

585
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,753
You don‘t see
any of them trying
to save the universe

586
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:39,838
from collapsing,
do you? Hmm? Hmm?

587
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,090
Let‘s get
back to work.

588
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:54,520
Well, they took it
rather hard.

589
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,062
I should go
talk to them.

590
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,815
In the morning.

591
00:30:57,815 --> 00:31:00,900
Give them a little time
to get used to the idea.

592
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:05,572
Come on. I‘ve got just
the thing to cheer you up.

593
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:12,287
ALL:
Dabo!

594
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,247
O‘BRIEN:
She‘s unbelievable.

595
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:17,835
Tell them how
you do it. Go on!

596
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:21,380
It has to do with a series
of binomial equations
and probability factors.

597
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,590
Explain how you track
the dependent variables.

598
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,843
It‘s really not
that interesting.

599
00:31:25,843 --> 00:31:27,761
ALL:
Dabo!

600
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:33,392
Well, hasn‘t this been fun?

601
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,811
Why not take a seat
and top off the evening

602
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:38,355
with a lovely bottle
of spring wine?

603
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:40,733
Should we?
He just wants you
to stop playing

604
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:42,651
so he doesn‘t lose
any more money.

605
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:47,113
Did I mention that
the wine was on the house?

606
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,574
Julian, let‘s
sit down.

607
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:49,991
But she‘s winning.

608
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,785
I‘ve... played enough.

609
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,040
QUARK:
This way, this way.

610
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,042
Uh, excuse me, excuse me.

611
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,627
Uh, uh, Ezri, over here.

612
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:04,757
CROWD:
Dabo!

613
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:06,842
(<i> laughter</i> )

614
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:09,511
(<i> dishes clattering</i> )

615
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,683
Sarina?

616
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:17,728
This way.

617
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:20,647
Julian, would you
mind if we left?

618
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:31,032
Oh, I‘m sorry.

619
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,701
I thought you were
having a good time.

620
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:35,662
Oh, I was, but there
was so much commotion.

621
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:38,081
Maybe I‘m just tired.

622
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,250
I‘ll tell you what.
Tomorrow night,

623
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,044
why don‘t we have
a nice, quiet dinner
in my quarters?

624
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,297
I have a week‘s
leave coming up.

625
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,299
I thought we might go
to Risa together,

626
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,426
get away from all
the distractions around here,

627
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:50,886
spend a little time alone.

628
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,763
All right.

629
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:54,514
I‘ll let you
get some rest, then.

630
00:33:11,782 --> 00:33:13,158
She‘s wonderful, Miles.

631
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:15,494
I‘ve never met
anybody like her.

632
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:18,121
She‘s brilliant,
sweet...

633
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:21,291
everything‘s new to her.
Being with her
is so refreshing.

634
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:24,336
She takes such delight
in what she‘s experiencing.

635
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:27,547
It makes me appreciate
things I usually take
for granted.

636
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:28,966
Like hot coffee?

637
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:31,217
Like coffee... music...

638
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:32,594
the way the stars shine.

639
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:34,680
What is wrong with this thing?

640
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,097
Are you listening to me?

641
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,182
Yes.

642
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:38,475
Yeah.

643
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:41,060
Coffee, music, stars.

644
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,729
Well, don‘t you have
anything to say?

645
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:46,650
As a matter of fact,
I do, Julian.

646
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:49,319
I haven‘t seen you like this
for a long time,

647
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:51,613
and I‘m really happy for you,

648
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,991
but don‘t you think
it‘s all happening
just a little too fast?

649
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:57,285
Well, we‘re
genetically engineered.
We do everything fast.

650
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:00,998
Julian, she‘s your patient.

651
00:34:00,998 --> 00:34:04,209
Not anymore.
I‘ve asked Doctor Girani
to take over her care.

652
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:10,131
Miles, I don‘t think
you understand
what this means to me.

653
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,425
All these years
I‘ve had to hide the fact

654
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,553
that my DNA
had been re-sequenced.

655
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,555
I listened to people talk about
the genetically engineered,

656
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,223
saying they were all misfits.

657
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,183
I used to fantasize
about meeting someone

658
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:23,228
who was like me,
who could live a normal life,

659
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:24,688
but it never happened--

660
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:26,523
until Sarina.

661
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:28,400
Don‘t you see?

662
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,486
She‘s the woman I‘ve been
waiting for all my life.

663
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,741
Well, good luck.

664
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,416
Computer...

665
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,251
music.

666
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:48,503
Something... romantic.

667
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,672
(<i> classical music playing</i> )

668
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:03,309
Computer, locate Sarina Douglas.

669
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,270
Sarina Douglas
is in her quarters

670
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:11,026
on the Habitat Ring, corridor
H-6, section 27-Epsilon.

671
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:23,496
Sarina!

672
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,040
It‘s me.

673
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:29,544
Computer, override door locks.

(<i> beeping</i> )

676
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:46,853
I‘ve been waiting
in my quarters for you.

677
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:49,731
Sarina?

678
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,032
Is something wrong?

679
00:36:03,954 --> 00:36:05,497
Sarina.

680
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,137
Apparently, the thalamic
pathways I generated
are still functioning,

681
00:36:20,137 --> 00:36:23,056
but Dr. Girani‘s not detected
any neural activity in them.

682
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:26,018
Do you have any idea
what‘s wrong?
Not a clue.

683
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:27,644
It‘s as if she were
just slipping away

684
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:29,146
and there‘s
nothing I can do

685
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:30,897
but wait and hope
she pulls out of it.

686
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,482
GIRANI:
You can go in now.

687
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:37,445
Sarina?

688
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:41,282
Don‘t be afraid.

689
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:44,202
Everything‘s going
to be all right.

690
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:49,791
I‘m not going
to give up on you... ever.

691
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,314
BASHIR: I don‘t know
what‘s wrong with her.

692
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,400
I need your help.
Why should we help you?

693
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,110
You just want to steal
her away from us.

694
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,571
Look at her!
Do you really want her

695
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:22,281
to spend the rest
of her life like this?

696
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:24,034
I mean, I‘ve been
trying to find a way

697
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:25,660
to reach her, but I can‘t.

698
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,746
Maybe there isn‘t one.

699
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:31,457
All I‘m asking
is that you try.

700
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:32,918
The three of
you know her

701
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:34,627
better than
anyone else.

702
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:38,757
Please... I don‘t
want to lose her.

703
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:44,763
All right, Julian.
Leave her here with us
for a while.

704
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:46,806
We‘ll see what we can do.

705
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,767
Thank you.

706
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:22,217
Are you sure?
I‘m sure.

707
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:23,843
We have to tell him.

708
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:26,554
Why? This way, we can
all stay together.

709
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:30,142
Let‘s go.

710
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,322
This way.
That way.

711
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,615
I think
we passed it.

712
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:47,033
Can I help you?

713
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,829
That‘s a stupid question.

714
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:01,089
(<i> door chimes</i> )

715
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,883
Come in.

716
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:06,803
We have to talk to you.

717
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:08,554
About Sarina?

718
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:11,016
Tell him.

719
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:14,352
She can still talk.
It‘s just that
she‘s afraid to.

720
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,688
I don‘t understand.
What is she afraid of?

721
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:19,983
We don‘t know.
But we think it has
something to do with you.

722
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,694
I‘m going to talk to her.

723
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:24,362
Stay here.

724
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,869
BASHIR:
Sarina.

725
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,622
Talk to me...

726
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,624
please.

727
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,837
I know you can.

728
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,635
What‘s wrong?

729
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:53,474
Is it me?

730
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:56,228
If it is, don‘t be afraid.

731
00:39:56,228 --> 00:39:58,646
I‘m going to do
whatever it takes

732
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,648
to make it right...

733
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,901
because I love you.

734
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:07,906
I want us to be together.

735
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:12,035
Tell me.

736
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:16,289
Do you love me?

737
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:22,003
I don‘t know.

738
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:27,425
I don‘t even understand
what love is.

739
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,261
I don‘t understand
anything.

740
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:30,970
Sarina...
What am I supposed to do?

741
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,015
What am I supposed
to feel? Tell me.

742
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:36,059
I want to make you happy.
I owe you everything.

743
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:39,104
Shh. You don‘t owe me.

744
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:42,399
You don‘t owe me anything.

745
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,903
I‘m sorry.

746
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:49,488
I wish I could be the woman
you want me to be.

747
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:50,782
Shh.

748
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,011
Morning.

749
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:14,973
Is she gone?

750
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,975
Her shuttle leaves
in a few minutes.

751
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:18,559
What about the others?

752
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:21,396
They left for the Institute
this morning.

753
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:26,985
I understand you‘ve arranged
a position for Sarina

754
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:29,446
at the Corgal
Research Center.

755
00:41:29,446 --> 00:41:31,281
Yeah, an internship.

756
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:33,783
She‘s going to work
under one of
the scientists there,

757
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:35,910
live with his family.

758
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,913
Are you okay?

759
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:43,918
How could I have been so blind?

760
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:47,422
What was I thinking,
trying to move things
along so fast?

761
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:49,882
She needed time.
I didn‘t give it to her.

762
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:54,095
I came this close
to driving her back
inside herself.

763
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,930
I‘m supposed to be a doctor.

764
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,975
I‘m supposed to put
my patient‘s needs above my own.

765
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:01,727
You didn‘t want
to be lonely anymore.

766
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,271
Nobody does.

767
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:07,275
(<i> sighs</i> )

768
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,569
I have to go to work.

769
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,240
You want to come over
for dinner tonight?

770
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,368
Keiko‘s making tempura.

771
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:19,996
(<i> sighs</i> ):
No, thanks.

772
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:48,400
So here you are...
on your way

773
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,777
to one of those tiny little
specks of light out there.

774
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,490
I guess that‘s what
a genetically enhanced girl

775
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:58,493
should do when she wakes up
from her sleep--

776
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:01,162
go make a life for herself.

777
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:07,919
I‘m going to miss you.

778
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:10,838
I‘m going to miss you.

779
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:13,258
You won‘t forget me?

780
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:15,552
Forget you?

781
00:43:15,552 --> 00:43:16,928
Never.

782
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:19,764
COMPUTER:
Final boarding call.

783
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,518
Well, I‘d better go.
