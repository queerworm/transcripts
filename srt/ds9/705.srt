1
00:00:02,531 --> 00:00:04,161
Miles, fancy a drink?

2
00:00:04,203 --> 00:00:05,433
I can't.

3
00:00:05,473 --> 00:00:07,501
Keiko and the kids
are waiting on me for dinner.

4
00:00:07,544 --> 00:00:09,070
Next Thursday...
book a holosuite.

5
00:00:09,116 --> 00:00:10,278
They're going to Bajor.

6
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:13,456
Hi, Julian.

7
00:00:13,494 --> 00:00:14,758
Hi.
You going to Vic's?

8
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:16,735
Yes.

9
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:18,637
Mind if I join you?

10
00:00:18,674 --> 00:00:21,512
Uh... actually, we
were looking forward

11
00:00:21,547 --> 00:00:23,677
to spending an evening alone.

12
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,350
Great.

13
00:00:25,391 --> 00:00:27,157
Well, have a great time.

14
00:00:29,234 --> 00:00:30,601
I understand.

15
00:00:41,432 --> 00:00:43,096
Cheeky virus.

16
00:00:43,137 --> 00:00:45,165
You've gone and mutated on me.

17
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:50,520
Well, you can run,
but you can't hide.

18
00:00:58,544 --> 00:01:00,447
Lights.

19
00:01:02,922 --> 00:01:04,825
Nog to Dr. Bashir.

20
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,856
Go ahead.

21
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,237
You're needed
in the Infirmary, sir.

22
00:01:10,274 --> 00:01:12,473
It's 3:00 in the morning.

23
00:01:12,513 --> 00:01:14,177
Isn't Dr. Girani on duty?

24
00:01:14,218 --> 00:01:16,486
Not anymore.

25
00:01:16,523 --> 00:01:18,426
Admiral Patrick threw her out.

26
00:01:19,665 --> 00:01:21,191
Admiral who?

27
00:01:21,236 --> 00:01:23,674
He wants to see you
immediately, sir.

28
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,304
On my way.

29
00:01:32,264 --> 00:01:33,597
What's going on, Ensign?

30
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,002
Sir, Admiral Patrick
and his staff

31
00:01:35,038 --> 00:01:36,200
just arrived on the <i>Farragut.</i>

32
00:01:36,242 --> 00:01:37,506
What happened to Dr. Girani?

33
00:01:37,545 --> 00:01:38,946
The Admiral said
she was asking

34
00:01:38,982 --> 00:01:40,178
too many stupid questions.

35
00:01:44,998 --> 00:01:47,128
Dr. Bashir reporting as ordered.

36
00:01:47,169 --> 00:01:48,399
Finally.

37
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,072
Patrick?!

38
00:01:51,113 --> 00:01:52,241
That's Admiral Patrick.

39
00:01:52,283 --> 00:01:54,254
Mind your manners, Doctor.

40
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:55,383
What are you doing here?

41
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:57,291
That's a stupid question.

42
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:59,266
Where did you get
those uniforms?

43
00:01:59,302 --> 00:02:01,432
That's a stupid question, too.

44
00:02:01,473 --> 00:02:03,467
Please excuse the doctor, sir.

45
00:02:03,512 --> 00:02:04,606
He just woke up.

46
00:02:04,648 --> 00:02:06,744
They're not
Starfleet officers, Nog.

47
00:02:06,788 --> 00:02:07,950
They're not?

48
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,016
We're mutants.

49
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,328
Genetically engineered mutants.

50
00:02:11,366 --> 00:02:12,460
Can't you tell?

51
00:02:12,502 --> 00:02:14,872
Does anybody at the Institute
know you're missing?

52
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:15,878
That's a stupid...

53
00:02:15,911 --> 00:02:17,939
Will you stop saying that!

54
00:02:17,983 --> 00:02:19,077
Why are you so upset?

55
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:21,318
You wanted Sarina brought here.
Well...

56
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:24,221
here she is.

57
00:02:26,405 --> 00:02:28,775
I was considering bringing
Sarina here for treatment

58
00:02:28,811 --> 00:02:30,041
when I was ready

59
00:02:30,081 --> 00:02:32,417
but I still have to modify
my surgical equipment

60
00:02:32,454 --> 00:02:34,084
before I can begin
the procedure.

61
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,389
Well, don't worry...
we'll help you.

62
00:02:35,428 --> 00:02:36,795
And when we're
through with Sarina

63
00:02:36,832 --> 00:02:38,894
she will be just like us.

64
00:02:38,937 --> 00:02:40,703
Do you have any idea

65
00:02:40,742 --> 00:02:41,904
how much trouble
you could get into

66
00:02:41,945 --> 00:02:43,677
for impersonating
Starfleet officers?

67
00:02:43,717 --> 00:02:45,847
Jack, you didn't say anything
about us getting into trouble.

68
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:47,051
Well, we didn't get caught,
did we?

69
00:02:47,092 --> 00:02:48,618
Didn't anybody question you?

70
00:02:48,662 --> 00:02:49,631
Of course.

71
00:02:49,665 --> 00:02:51,363
But when they did,
Patrick would say...

72
00:02:51,403 --> 00:02:53,033
That's a stupid...

73
00:02:53,074 --> 00:02:55,946
You'd be surprised
how well it works.

74
00:02:55,981 --> 00:02:57,280
I'll say.

75
00:02:57,318 --> 00:02:58,617
What are they going do to us?

76
00:02:58,655 --> 00:02:59,681
Oh, it's all right.

77
00:02:59,725 --> 00:03:01,058
I'll find a way

78
00:03:01,095 --> 00:03:04,001
to straighten this out...
somehow.

79
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,277
Hello, Sarina.

80
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:09,442
Remember me?

81
00:03:09,484 --> 00:03:11,455
Of course she remembers you.

82
00:03:11,555 --> 00:03:12,454
She's not an idiot.

83
00:03:12,558 --> 00:03:13,925
She's just a little cataleptic.

84
00:03:13,962 --> 00:03:15,592
Are you really
going to be able

85
00:03:15,633 --> 00:03:16,693
to make her better?

86
00:03:16,735 --> 00:03:19,641
I'm going to do
everything I can.

87
00:03:19,676 --> 00:03:21,944
I promise.

88
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,720
They posed as an Admiral
and his staff.

89
00:05:21,795 --> 00:05:23,857
If you want me to convince
Starfleet not to press charges

90
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,134
you're going to have to give me
a damn good reason.

91
00:05:26,173 --> 00:05:27,403
They wanted
to bring Sarina here

92
00:05:27,443 --> 00:05:28,503
so that I could help her.

93
00:05:28,546 --> 00:05:29,515
They meant well.

94
00:05:29,548 --> 00:05:30,517
They meant well?

95
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:32,077
That's the same
excuse you gave me

96
00:05:32,122 --> 00:05:33,091
when they were caught

97
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,220
trying to pass military
secrets to the Dominion.

98
00:05:35,264 --> 00:05:36,392
They were trying
to save lives...

99
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:38,370
Doctor, I appreciate

100
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:39,897
that you feel
a connection to them

101
00:05:39,942 --> 00:05:41,913
because you are genetically
engineered yourself

102
00:05:41,947 --> 00:05:43,211
but they have displayed

103
00:05:43,251 --> 00:05:45,279
a consistent disregard
for the rules

104
00:05:45,323 --> 00:05:46,987
that the rest of society
lives by.

105
00:05:47,027 --> 00:05:48,087
Maybe that's because

106
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,260
they're not allowed
to live in society.

107
00:05:50,303 --> 00:05:52,206
We are not here
to debate Federation policy

108
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:53,676
toward
the genetically enhanced.

109
00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:56,377
We are here to discuss
what to do about these people

110
00:05:56,418 --> 00:05:57,682
now that they're aboard.

111
00:05:57,721 --> 00:05:59,885
Of course.

112
00:05:59,928 --> 00:06:01,626
Well, with your permission, sir

113
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:04,434
I would like to proceed
with Sarina's treatment.

114
00:06:04,472 --> 00:06:05,771
Well, I take it the Institute

115
00:06:05,842 --> 00:06:07,676
has given the approval
to move forward?

116
00:06:07,714 --> 00:06:11,120
A copy of the medical
protocols I submitted.

117
00:06:11,157 --> 00:06:13,185
Dr. Loews,
Sarina's legal guardian

118
00:06:13,228 --> 00:06:14,492
has given her consent.

119
00:06:15,768 --> 00:06:17,500
Well, it appears
that this procedure

120
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,804
has never been done before.

121
00:06:18,876 --> 00:06:20,813
Well, there's no guarantee
that it will work, of course

122
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:23,183
but if it does, it could change
everything for her.

123
00:06:23,221 --> 00:06:25,055
There's no reason
to think that she's suffering

124
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,064
from the same type
of behavioral disorders

125
00:06:27,098 --> 00:06:28,260
as Jack and the others.

126
00:06:28,301 --> 00:06:30,535
Her problem is that she's
trapped inside her own mind.

127
00:06:30,574 --> 00:06:32,204
This could free her.

128
00:06:32,245 --> 00:06:34,843
There are still a few technical
issues I have to work on

129
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:37,584
but I feel confident
that I can iron them all out.

130
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:41,294
You've put in a lot of time
on this, haven't you?

131
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:42,770
I owe it to her, sir.

132
00:06:42,805 --> 00:06:45,141
I could have ended up
the same way as Sarina

133
00:06:45,178 --> 00:06:46,442
but I was lucky.

134
00:06:46,481 --> 00:06:47,745
My DNA re-sequencing

135
00:06:47,785 --> 00:06:49,984
didn't have
any unintended side effects.

136
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:53,522
All right, Doctor.

137
00:06:53,567 --> 00:06:56,735
I'll take care of Starfleet.
You take care of Sarina.

138
00:06:56,775 --> 00:06:58,609
Thank you, sir.
I'll arrange to have

139
00:06:58,647 --> 00:07:00,777
the rest of the people
sent back to the Institute.

140
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:02,311
Actually, I was hoping

141
00:07:02,356 --> 00:07:03,986
you'd allow them
to stay on for awhile.

142
00:07:04,027 --> 00:07:05,257
For what reason?

143
00:07:05,297 --> 00:07:07,268
Sarina's spent the last
15 years with them.

144
00:07:07,303 --> 00:07:09,001
Now, assuming
the procedure works

145
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,600
and she comes out
of her isolation

146
00:07:10,644 --> 00:07:12,342
I think it would be
helpful to have

147
00:07:12,382 --> 00:07:13,646
some familiar faces around.

148
00:07:13,686 --> 00:07:15,885
Well, we'll arrange
for quarters

149
00:07:15,924 --> 00:07:18,020
to be set up in the cargo bay.

150
00:07:18,064 --> 00:07:19,659
I appreciate it.

151
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:23,237
Just make sure they stay there.

152
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:25,077
I don't want them to get
out and cause trouble

153
00:07:25,115 --> 00:07:26,414
like they did the last time.

154
00:07:26,452 --> 00:07:27,819
I'll see that it
doesn't happen again.

155
00:07:27,855 --> 00:07:29,154
I'll hold you to that.

156
00:07:29,193 --> 00:07:30,857
One thing more.

157
00:07:30,897 --> 00:07:32,629
Get them out
of those uniforms.

158
00:07:32,668 --> 00:07:33,659
Aye, sir.

159
00:07:36,077 --> 00:07:38,207
There.
Don't you look pretty?

160
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,445
Why are we doing this anyway?

161
00:07:39,486 --> 00:07:40,455
Keep going.

162
00:07:40,489 --> 00:07:41,685
Here?

163
00:07:41,725 --> 00:07:43,491
A little to the left.

164
00:07:45,267 --> 00:07:47,238
That's not where it was
last time.

165
00:07:47,272 --> 00:07:48,798
Oh, what difference
does it make?

166
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:49,835
He's right.

167
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,974
Fine.

168
00:07:51,049 --> 00:07:52,143
How's that?

169
00:07:52,185 --> 00:07:53,176
Much better.

170
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,820
Here he is!

171
00:07:55,862 --> 00:07:57,492
Well, well, what did
the Captain say?

172
00:07:57,533 --> 00:07:58,502
All systems are a go.

173
00:07:58,535 --> 00:07:59,663
See? See?

174
00:07:59,705 --> 00:08:01,642
I told you it was a good
idea to bring her here.

175
00:08:01,676 --> 00:08:02,940
That's right, Jack,
I remember.

176
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:04,507
So, when do we operate?

177
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:05,177
We?

178
00:08:06,222 --> 00:08:07,817
You're going to need some help.

179
00:08:07,859 --> 00:08:08,953
Oh, so you're a surgeon now?

180
00:08:09,062 --> 00:08:10,429
How hard can it be?

181
00:08:10,466 --> 00:08:11,901
Um, thanks for the offer, but...

182
00:08:11,937 --> 00:08:13,099
Oh, I get it.

183
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,609
You want to take
all the credit.

184
00:08:14,644 --> 00:08:15,613
It's not about credit.

185
00:08:15,647 --> 00:08:17,550
It's about what's best
for Sarina, I think.

186
00:08:17,585 --> 00:08:19,921
Fine. I'm busy, anyway.

187
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,450
New project.

188
00:08:21,495 --> 00:08:22,521
Oh, glad to hear it.

189
00:08:22,564 --> 00:08:23,658
What are you working on?

190
00:08:23,701 --> 00:08:25,501
Wouldn't you like to know?

191
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,669
Well, I'll leave you to it

192
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:28,737
but, uh, do me a favor

193
00:08:28,781 --> 00:08:30,581
and, uh, change out
of those uniforms.

194
00:08:37,904 --> 00:08:41,437
Sarina, I'd like to take
you to the Infirmary

195
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,915
and run a few tests.

196
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,112
Is that all right?

197
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,357
She's afraid it's going to hurt.

198
00:08:47,395 --> 00:08:49,559
It won't hurt.
I promise.

199
00:08:49,601 --> 00:08:51,299
You're in good hands...

200
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:53,401
very good hands.

201
00:08:54,848 --> 00:08:55,874
Don't get your hopes up, Julian.

202
00:08:55,917 --> 00:08:58,481
It's over
between the two of us.

203
00:08:58,524 --> 00:09:00,586
I have a new man in my life...

204
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,330
that gorgeous little Ferengi.

205
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,600
Nog?

206
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,235
Jealous?

207
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:08,716
Oh, that's so sweet.

208
00:09:12,895 --> 00:09:14,091
Hurry back.

209
00:09:20,347 --> 00:09:21,441
Sarina's cerebral cortex

210
00:09:21,484 --> 00:09:24,218
was genetically enhanced
in order to accelerate the rate

211
00:09:24,257 --> 00:09:26,285
at which
she can process information.

212
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:29,361
Now, the only problem is,
her visual and auditory systems

213
00:09:29,405 --> 00:09:32,573
can't channel the stimuli
into the cortex fast enough

214
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,014
so, because
they're out of sync

215
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,044
she can't focus on
what's going on around her.

216
00:09:36,088 --> 00:09:37,057
Well, is there any way

217
00:09:37,091 --> 00:09:38,789
to get her sensory
processors up to speed?

218
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:39,798
I need to stimulate
the growth

219
00:09:39,831 --> 00:09:41,893
of new synapses in the thalamus

220
00:09:41,937 --> 00:09:45,470
which means...
I have to manipulate

221
00:09:45,513 --> 00:09:48,145
neural proteins
at a subatomic level.

222
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,157
Well, then you've
got a problem.

223
00:09:50,225 --> 00:09:53,165
This is the most advanced
neocortical probe made

224
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,103
and it's not nearly
that accurate.

225
00:09:55,138 --> 00:09:57,736
Now you know why
I asked you down here.

226
00:09:57,778 --> 00:09:59,008
Well, I wish I could
help you, Julian

227
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:00,985
but at resolutions
that small

228
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,324
quantum fluctuations
are impossible to control

229
00:10:04,361 --> 00:10:06,457
and I can't make this
thing any more accurate.

230
00:10:06,501 --> 00:10:09,030
How can you say that before
you've even tried it?

231
00:10:09,074 --> 00:10:11,569
I'm sorry, Julian.
It-it-it can't be done.

232
00:10:11,614 --> 00:10:12,810
I'm sorry.

233
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,912
Well, sorry just isn't
good enough, Miles.

234
00:10:14,956 --> 00:10:18,397
This is Sarina's only chance
at living a normal life.

235
00:10:18,432 --> 00:10:21,166
Julian, I can't break
the laws of physics.

236
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:22,299
Nobody can.

237
00:10:32,601 --> 00:10:34,435
Your friend was right.

238
00:10:34,473 --> 00:10:36,410
You can't break
the laws of physics.

239
00:10:38,851 --> 00:10:41,085
But you can bend them.

240
00:10:41,123 --> 00:10:43,391
We recalibrated
the imaging diodes.

241
00:10:43,429 --> 00:10:44,591
It is so accurate

242
00:10:44,632 --> 00:10:46,033
that you could clip
the wings of an angel

243
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:47,402
dancing on the head of a pin.

244
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:50,277
Uh... if you wanted to.

245
00:11:59,994 --> 00:12:02,090
Anything?

246
00:12:10,956 --> 00:12:12,790
Sarina?

247
00:12:12,894 --> 00:12:15,492
Now, just how am I
supposed to know

248
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:17,060
you understand me

249
00:12:17,105 --> 00:12:21,138
if you don't give
me some sign, hmm?

250
00:12:21,182 --> 00:12:23,176
Anything.

251
00:12:23,221 --> 00:12:25,557
It doesn't matter how small.

252
00:12:37,158 --> 00:12:38,491
It's been five days now

253
00:12:38,528 --> 00:12:40,192
and she's just as unresponsive

254
00:12:40,231 --> 00:12:42,065
as she was before
the procedure.

255
00:12:42,103 --> 00:12:43,767
I know you're
disappointed, Julian

256
00:12:43,808 --> 00:12:45,711
but you did everything
that you could.

257
00:12:45,746 --> 00:12:47,444
Well, it wasn't enough.

258
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:50,313
I'm sorry.

259
00:12:50,358 --> 00:12:53,230
Obviously, you want
to punish yourself.

260
00:12:53,265 --> 00:12:55,168
Do you want help?

261
00:12:55,204 --> 00:12:57,175
Because I'm really good
at punishing myself.

262
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,543
Let's see...

263
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,348
if I were you,
I'd be kicking myself

264
00:13:01,386 --> 00:13:03,118
for making promises
I couldn't keep

265
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:05,630
for getting people's hopes up

266
00:13:05,664 --> 00:13:07,133
for being arrogant
enough to think

267
00:13:07,168 --> 00:13:08,228
that I could help Sarina

268
00:13:08,271 --> 00:13:11,073
even though dozens
of other doctors have failed.

269
00:13:11,112 --> 00:13:12,081
Should I keep going?

270
00:13:12,114 --> 00:13:13,812
No.

271
00:13:13,852 --> 00:13:16,051
That just about covers it.
Thanks.

272
00:13:16,092 --> 00:13:17,618
Glad I could help.

273
00:13:20,403 --> 00:13:21,531
What is it?

274
00:13:24,113 --> 00:13:26,107
I'm not sure.

275
00:13:34,807 --> 00:13:35,969
Excuse me.

276
00:13:37,012 --> 00:13:38,481
Sarina?

277
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:40,488
What are you looking at?

278
00:13:40,522 --> 00:13:43,792
Every... thing.

279
00:13:52,185 --> 00:13:55,421
You... heard me.

280
00:13:55,461 --> 00:13:58,731
I thought something

281
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:01,367
and you heard it.

282
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:02,901
Sarina...

283
00:14:04,049 --> 00:14:05,917
you spoke.

284
00:14:35,097 --> 00:14:36,692
Sarina.

285
00:14:36,735 --> 00:14:37,999
Come and sit down.

286
00:14:38,038 --> 00:14:40,272
I need to run a few tests.

287
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,057
What is it?

288
00:14:49,133 --> 00:14:51,297
Listen.

289
00:14:52,442 --> 00:14:53,502
It's nice.

290
00:14:53,544 --> 00:14:54,535
You're right.

291
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,072
I hadn't noticed that before.

292
00:14:57,922 --> 00:14:59,756
That's a little odd.

293
00:14:59,794 --> 00:15:03,463
Her norepinephrine levels
are slightly elevated.

294
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:04,972
What's causing it?

295
00:15:05,008 --> 00:15:06,307
I'm not sure.

296
00:15:06,344 --> 00:15:10,286
It's probably due to
limbic overcompensation.

297
00:15:10,321 --> 00:15:11,951
The levels should drop

298
00:15:11,992 --> 00:15:13,963
when the new
thalamic connections

299
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:15,523
stabilize.

300
00:15:15,569 --> 00:15:17,905
You're right... I think.

301
00:15:17,941 --> 00:15:19,707
I was listening

302
00:15:19,745 --> 00:15:23,848
when you were telling the
nurses about the procedure.

303
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:27,832
I kept thinking that
I wanted to thank you

304
00:15:27,867 --> 00:15:30,966
for what you were
trying to do for me...

305
00:15:31,008 --> 00:15:34,107
and now I finally can.

306
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:36,120
Thank you.

307
00:15:42,204 --> 00:15:43,936
Did you move this?

308
00:15:43,975 --> 00:15:45,741
Maybe I did, maybe I didn't.

309
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,309
Would you leave him alone?

310
00:15:48,353 --> 00:15:52,626
Patrick, it's where
it's supposed to be.

311
00:15:53,901 --> 00:15:55,427
Oh...

312
00:16:01,219 --> 00:16:03,885
Hello, everyone.

313
00:16:03,927 --> 00:16:06,126
Did you hear what she said?

314
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:07,634
Did you hear that?

315
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,071
I don't think I've heard

316
00:16:09,107 --> 00:16:10,941
a more beautiful
sound in my life.

317
00:16:10,979 --> 00:16:13,075
It was my idea
to bring you here!

318
00:16:13,118 --> 00:16:14,087
We missed you!

319
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,248
You look so different!

320
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,486
Aren't you going
to say thank you?

321
00:16:16,526 --> 00:16:17,552
Did the surgery hurt?

322
00:16:17,596 --> 00:16:21,436
There's so much I want
to say to all of you.

323
00:16:21,473 --> 00:16:23,273
Why are you talking
like that?

324
00:16:23,311 --> 00:16:24,678
Quiet!

325
00:16:24,714 --> 00:16:25,876
There's so much I want

326
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:27,113
to say to all of you...
There's so much...

327
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:28,123
Jack!

328
00:16:28,157 --> 00:16:30,128
No, he's right.

329
00:16:30,162 --> 00:16:31,826
I can hear the way I sound.

330
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:33,335
Don't worry.
It's only temporary.

331
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:34,862
It just takes a little practice.

332
00:16:34,907 --> 00:16:36,707
Practice!
Ah, practice. Good idea.

333
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,409
Listen to this, Sarina.

334
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:41,447
Do, re, mi, fa, so,
la, ti, do.

335
00:16:41,491 --> 00:16:45,228
Do, re, mi, fa,
so, la, ti, do.

336
00:16:45,301 --> 00:16:46,531
Are you tone deaf?

337
00:16:46,571 --> 00:16:48,907
You're the one who's tone deaf.

338
00:16:48,944 --> 00:16:53,011
Do, re, mi, fa, so,
la, ti, do.

339
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:58,125
Do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti, do.

340
00:16:58,167 --> 00:17:00,297
Much better.

341
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,972
Do, re, mi, fa, so,
la, ti...

342
00:17:03,013 --> 00:17:05,679
Do, re, mi, fa,
so, la, ti...

343
00:17:05,721 --> 00:17:08,125
Do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti...

344
00:17:09,296 --> 00:17:11,324
Do.

345
00:17:12,706 --> 00:17:14,574
Yes, yes-yes-yes.

346
00:17:14,611 --> 00:17:15,637
Let's improvise.

347
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,616
Lauren.

348
00:17:19,156 --> 00:17:21,492
Do, re, mi, do, re, mi...

349
00:17:21,529 --> 00:17:23,967
Do, re, mi,
do, re, mi...

350
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:26,668
Fa, mi, re, do

351
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,702
Fa, mi, re,
do

352
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:31,379
Do, re, mi,
do, re, mi

353
00:17:31,421 --> 00:17:33,689
- Fa...
- Do, re, mi, do, re, mi

354
00:17:33,726 --> 00:17:36,494
- Fa
- Fa, mi, re, do

355
00:17:36,534 --> 00:17:40,135
Fa, mi, re, do.

356
00:17:44,054 --> 00:17:45,684
Molto allegro.

357
00:17:47,562 --> 00:17:50,034
Do, re, mi, do, re, mi

358
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,972
Fa, mi, re, do

359
00:17:52,007 --> 00:17:53,135
Do, re, mi, do, re, mi

360
00:17:53,177 --> 00:17:54,977
Fa, mi, re, do

361
00:17:55,015 --> 00:17:56,541
Do, re, mi, do, re, mi

362
00:17:56,586 --> 00:17:58,352
- Fa, so, la, so
- Re, mi, fa, mi

363
00:17:58,391 --> 00:17:59,917
Do, re, mi, do, re, mi

364
00:17:59,961 --> 00:18:02,297
- Do...
- Fa, mi, re, mi

365
00:18:02,401 --> 00:18:04,542
Re, do, re, mi, do

366
00:18:04,676 --> 00:18:06,111
Do, re, mi, do, re, mi

367
00:18:06,146 --> 00:18:07,878
- La, so, fa, so
- Fa, mi, re, do

368
00:18:07,918 --> 00:18:09,114
Do, re, mi, do, re, mi

369
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:11,490
- La, ti, do
- Fa, so, la, so

370
00:18:11,527 --> 00:18:16,529
So, do, ti, do, so, mi,
fa, so, la

371
00:18:16,574 --> 00:18:18,340
So

372
00:18:18,379 --> 00:18:19,746
Do, re, mi, do, re, mi

373
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,318
Fa, mi, re, do

374
00:18:21,352 --> 00:18:23,916
Do, re, mi, do, re, mi

375
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,230
Fa, so, la, so

376
00:18:27,268 --> 00:18:28,737
So, fa, so

377
00:18:28,772 --> 00:18:30,264
Do, re, mi, do, re, mi

378
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,371
Fa, mi, re, do

379
00:18:38,163 --> 00:18:41,001
- Do, re, mi, do, re, mi
- Fa, so, ti, do

380
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:43,805
- Do, re, mi, do, re, mi
- So, fa, so...

381
00:18:43,911 --> 00:18:45,575
Do, re, mi, do, re, mi

382
00:18:45,615 --> 00:18:47,107
Fa, mi, re, do

383
00:18:47,153 --> 00:18:50,525
- Do, re, mi, do, re, mi
- Do, mi, so, la

384
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,658
- Fa, mi, re, do
- So...

385
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,674
Do.

386
00:19:05,434 --> 00:19:06,767
It was amazing.

387
00:19:06,804 --> 00:19:08,798
Within a few minutes,
Sarina's voice just took off.

388
00:19:08,909 --> 00:19:10,139
That kind of improvement

389
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:11,809
usually takes weeks
of speech therapy.

390
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:12,978
That is amazing.

391
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,182
Julian...

392
00:19:14,223 --> 00:19:15,192
So, she was exhausted.

393
00:19:15,225 --> 00:19:16,524
I took her back
to the Infirmary.

394
00:19:16,563 --> 00:19:18,659
I needed to monitor her neural
activity anyway while she slept

395
00:19:18,701 --> 00:19:20,831
but I still can't get
over that transformation.

396
00:19:20,907 --> 00:19:22,673
Yesterday, she was
silent as a stone.

397
00:19:22,711 --> 00:19:24,682
Today, she's singing
and laughing...

398
00:19:24,717 --> 00:19:26,620
You should have seen her, Miles.

399
00:19:26,656 --> 00:19:27,818
How could I?

400
00:19:27,859 --> 00:19:29,523
I've been sitting here
all night.

401
00:19:30,532 --> 00:19:31,694
Is it Thursday?

402
00:19:31,735 --> 00:19:34,367
Well, why else would I
be sitting here all night?

403
00:19:34,409 --> 00:19:35,537
Oh...

404
00:19:35,579 --> 00:19:37,413
I'm sorry. I forgot.

405
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,783
It's all right.

406
00:19:40,358 --> 00:19:43,491
Morn caught me up
on how his 17 brothers

407
00:19:43,533 --> 00:19:45,367
and sisters are doing.

408
00:19:45,404 --> 00:19:46,600
I'd better head off.

409
00:19:46,641 --> 00:19:48,167
I got an early start
in the morning.

410
00:19:48,211 --> 00:19:50,479
Oh, I'm sorry
about the mix-up, Miles.

411
00:19:50,517 --> 00:19:52,043
Mmm.

412
00:19:52,088 --> 00:19:53,580
It's all right.

413
00:19:55,464 --> 00:19:57,698
I'm happy for her.

414
00:19:57,736 --> 00:20:00,072
Happy for both of you.

415
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,956
Sarina.

416
00:20:09,065 --> 00:20:10,695
What are you doing here?

417
00:20:10,736 --> 00:20:12,069
How did you get in?

418
00:20:12,106 --> 00:20:13,632
It wasn't hard.

419
00:20:13,678 --> 00:20:16,276
Your access code
only has six digits.

420
00:20:16,318 --> 00:20:18,414
Is something wrong?

421
00:20:18,456 --> 00:20:20,188
I-I couldn't sleep.

422
00:20:22,667 --> 00:20:25,766
My nurse could have given
you something for that.

423
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:28,874
I... don't want to sleep.

424
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:30,250
Why not?

425
00:20:30,287 --> 00:20:33,659
What if I wake up the way I was?

426
00:20:33,696 --> 00:20:34,995
What if I can't...

427
00:20:36,804 --> 00:20:39,572
It's not going to happen.

428
00:20:39,611 --> 00:20:42,710
Your life's going
to be different now.

429
00:20:42,753 --> 00:20:46,286
Your future...

430
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:49,029
is full of possibilities.

431
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,275
You know, you're going
to be doing things

432
00:20:54,316 --> 00:20:57,814
that you haven't
even dreamed of.

433
00:20:57,858 --> 00:21:00,696
There's really no
reason to be afraid.

434
00:21:05,746 --> 00:21:07,614
Sarina?

435
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:40,697
Good morning.

436
00:21:40,737 --> 00:21:42,674
Morning.

437
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,976
You didn't account
for the L-Two codon.

438
00:21:45,015 --> 00:21:46,143
What?

439
00:21:46,218 --> 00:21:48,314
That's why the virus mutated.

440
00:21:48,356 --> 00:21:51,158
You need to target
the RNA transcriptor.

441
00:21:51,231 --> 00:21:52,723
Hungry?

442
00:21:54,673 --> 00:21:56,541
The L-Two codon...

443
00:21:57,581 --> 00:21:59,141
Of course.

444
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:00,653
Why didn't I think of that?

445
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:03,757
Sarina...

446
00:22:03,797 --> 00:22:06,133
you're amazing.

447
00:22:06,237 --> 00:22:08,333
I've been working
on this for months.

448
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:10,403
You would have seen it
sooner or later.

449
00:22:12,018 --> 00:22:14,148
I don't know about that.

450
00:22:14,257 --> 00:22:15,921
Thank you.

451
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:18,456
I'm glad I could do
something for you.

452
00:22:18,501 --> 00:22:21,133
You've done so much for me.

453
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:23,408
Infirmary to Dr. Bashir.

454
00:22:23,447 --> 00:22:24,814
Go ahead.

455
00:22:24,851 --> 00:22:27,551
Dr. Girani is asking for
your assistance in surgery, sir.

456
00:22:27,592 --> 00:22:29,061
I'm on my way.

457
00:22:30,633 --> 00:22:32,068
Well, looks like I'm
going to be tied up

458
00:22:32,103 --> 00:22:33,299
for the next few hours.

459
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,208
What would you like
to do in the meantime?

460
00:22:35,278 --> 00:22:36,770
Would you like
a tour of the station?

461
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:38,445
I can ask Ezri
to show you around.

462
00:22:38,486 --> 00:22:39,978
That's all right.

463
00:22:40,024 --> 00:22:42,052
I think I'll go see Jack
and the others.

464
00:22:42,096 --> 00:22:43,065
All right.

465
00:22:43,098 --> 00:22:44,590
I'll have someone take
you to the cargo bay

466
00:22:44,636 --> 00:22:45,832
and when I'm finished
with surgery

467
00:22:45,872 --> 00:22:47,364
I'll join you there.

468
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:50,075
Oh, wait.
You need your breakfast.

469
00:22:57,903 --> 00:22:59,270
Thank you.

470
00:23:07,662 --> 00:23:09,063
The fact is, is
that the universe

471
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:10,227
is going to stop expanding

472
00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:12,035
and it is going
to collapse in on itself.

473
00:23:12,074 --> 00:23:14,136
We've got to do something
before it's too late.

474
00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:15,705
How much time do we have left?

475
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,185
60 trillion years...
70 at the most.

476
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,384
Oh, no!

477
00:23:19,427 --> 00:23:21,455
Isn't Nog handsome?

478
00:23:25,308 --> 00:23:26,868
What are you doing?!

479
00:23:26,912 --> 00:23:29,441
We are running out of time!

480
00:23:29,486 --> 00:23:31,720
Sarina! Thank God.

481
00:23:33,061 --> 00:23:34,553
Nobody else around here
ever listens to me.

482
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:36,570
What is it, Jack?
What's wrong?

483
00:23:36,604 --> 00:23:37,698
There's too much matter.

484
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,508
The universe is too heavy
for its own good.

485
00:23:40,547 --> 00:23:43,019
You need to lighten the load.

486
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:44,148
Yes, yes, yes, exactly.

487
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,093
We have to find some way
to decrease the mass.

488
00:23:46,128 --> 00:23:47,723
Of the entire universe?

489
00:23:47,766 --> 00:23:49,326
That's the whole point.

490
00:23:49,403 --> 00:23:50,702
Is that possible?

491
00:23:50,741 --> 00:23:52,541
That's what we're trying
to figure out, Sarina.

492
00:23:52,578 --> 00:23:55,609
What if we found
a way to manipulate subspace?

493
00:23:55,653 --> 00:23:57,179
Mmm... hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm.

494
00:23:57,224 --> 00:23:58,716
Change the cosmological
constant.

495
00:23:58,761 --> 00:23:59,730
Mmm. Yes, yes, yes.

496
00:23:59,764 --> 00:24:01,233
That'd do the trick.

497
00:24:01,268 --> 00:24:04,903
You can't change
the cosmological constant.

498
00:24:06,314 --> 00:24:07,647
You know something, Sarina

499
00:24:07,685 --> 00:24:10,283
we are trying to save
existence as we know it

500
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:12,729
and all you can do is criticize.

501
00:24:12,765 --> 00:24:14,098
I'm sorry.

502
00:24:14,135 --> 00:24:15,104
Thank you!

503
00:24:15,138 --> 00:24:16,164
Now, where were we?

504
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:17,938
Manipulating subspace.

505
00:24:17,978 --> 00:24:18,969
Right, right.

506
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:37,217
Doctor!

507
00:24:39,467 --> 00:24:40,561
Glad you're here.

508
00:24:40,603 --> 00:24:41,731
Is she all right?

509
00:24:42,776 --> 00:24:44,474
Sarina, are you all right?

510
00:24:45,616 --> 00:24:47,587
She's fine.

511
00:24:47,621 --> 00:24:49,855
Listen, you have to talk
to Starfleet for us.

512
00:24:49,894 --> 00:24:52,560
We need subspace
field generators... lots of them.

513
00:24:52,601 --> 00:24:54,070
Can we talk about it later?

514
00:24:54,106 --> 00:24:57,046
Later? There isn't going
to be a "later" later.

515
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,117
Now, once we get the
field generators...

516
00:25:03,162 --> 00:25:04,631
Sarina?

517
00:25:05,735 --> 00:25:07,797
Hi.

518
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:09,779
Is something wrong?

519
00:25:09,813 --> 00:25:13,346
Oh, no. They're used
to my being quiet.

520
00:25:13,389 --> 00:25:14,790
It's easier this way.

521
00:25:17,533 --> 00:25:19,128
Could be very messy.

522
00:25:19,171 --> 00:25:22,168
Um... some of my friends
want to get together

523
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:24,182
a little later on at Quark's

524
00:25:24,217 --> 00:25:26,587
and I was wondering
if you'd like to come along.

525
00:25:26,623 --> 00:25:28,389
Me?

526
00:25:28,428 --> 00:25:29,761
Do you want to?

527
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,360
When should we be ready?

528
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,635
Uh...

529
00:25:33,675 --> 00:25:35,771
Oh, we're not invited, Jack.

530
00:25:35,813 --> 00:25:37,146
Just her.

531
00:25:37,184 --> 00:25:38,312
Figures.

532
00:25:38,353 --> 00:25:39,788
That doesn't seem fair.

533
00:25:39,824 --> 00:25:41,350
It's all right.

534
00:25:42,364 --> 00:25:43,355
Come on, Sarina.

535
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:45,336
Let's get you dressed.

536
00:26:04,488 --> 00:26:06,790
Sorry to keep you waiting.

537
00:26:06,827 --> 00:26:08,228
Come on out.

538
00:26:08,331 --> 00:26:09,493
Come on.

539
00:26:12,542 --> 00:26:15,482
Am I good, or am I good?

540
00:26:21,398 --> 00:26:23,460
Look at all the people.

541
00:26:30,254 --> 00:26:31,723
Here they are.

542
00:26:33,229 --> 00:26:34,824
I don't remember her being so...

543
00:26:34,867 --> 00:26:35,836
Beautiful.

544
00:26:35,869 --> 00:26:36,929
Yeah.

545
00:26:36,972 --> 00:26:38,943
Everyone, this is Sarina.

546
00:26:38,977 --> 00:26:40,310
Sarina, this is everyone.

547
00:26:40,347 --> 00:26:41,316
Odo.

548
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,319
Nerys.

549
00:26:42,353 --> 00:26:43,583
I'm Miles.

550
00:26:43,623 --> 00:26:45,092
I remember you.

551
00:26:45,127 --> 00:26:46,961
You're Julian's best friend.

552
00:26:46,998 --> 00:26:50,029
Well... we get on all right.

553
00:26:50,073 --> 00:26:52,169
For the most part.

554
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:54,341
Why are you pretending
that it's not true?

555
00:26:54,418 --> 00:26:55,614
Because they're men

556
00:26:55,654 --> 00:26:57,784
and men have trouble
expressing their feelings.

557
00:26:59,731 --> 00:27:01,098
You don't.

558
00:27:01,135 --> 00:27:02,297
Oh, are you kidding?

559
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:04,309
Odo never talks
about his feelings.

560
00:27:04,377 --> 00:27:06,473
He took your hand.

561
00:27:06,515 --> 00:27:07,950
He's showing you his feelings.

562
00:27:08,988 --> 00:27:10,014
Thank you.

563
00:27:10,058 --> 00:27:11,459
Julian

564
00:27:11,495 --> 00:27:14,093
why don't you show everybody
how much you love me

565
00:27:14,135 --> 00:27:15,570
and order the next round.

566
00:27:18,112 --> 00:27:19,376
Hey, Broik.

567
00:27:20,384 --> 00:27:21,751
I liked your friends...

568
00:27:21,789 --> 00:27:23,589
all of them.

569
00:27:23,627 --> 00:27:26,726
If I had to find
someone to replace Atlas

570
00:27:26,768 --> 00:27:29,674
and hold up the world,
it'd be Miles.

571
00:27:29,709 --> 00:27:32,375
He'd do it with a smile, too.

572
00:27:32,483 --> 00:27:35,582
And Kira... she never
doubts herself

573
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:37,824
which is what Odo
finds so fascinating

574
00:27:37,863 --> 00:27:39,629
because he doubts
everything but her.

575
00:27:39,668 --> 00:27:41,571
What about Ezri?

576
00:27:41,606 --> 00:27:44,705
The day she realizes she's more
than just the sum of her parts

577
00:27:44,748 --> 00:27:46,412
she's really going
to be something.

578
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:48,149
I can't believe you saw all that

579
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:50,058
after just a few hours
with them.

580
00:27:50,095 --> 00:27:52,693
I'm going to have to start
putting on my poker face.

581
00:27:52,735 --> 00:27:54,672
Too late. You've already
given yourself away.

582
00:27:54,707 --> 00:27:55,937
Is that right?

583
00:27:55,977 --> 00:27:58,245
And how would you describe me?

584
00:27:58,283 --> 00:27:59,616
Compassionate

585
00:27:59,653 --> 00:28:01,122
brilliant

586
00:28:01,158 --> 00:28:03,392
lonely.

587
00:28:03,463 --> 00:28:05,799
Well.
Two out of three isn't bad.

588
00:28:05,836 --> 00:28:07,305
Which two?

589
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,174
Now, that would be telling.

590
00:28:10,381 --> 00:28:13,321
I'm glad you
liked my friends.

591
00:28:13,356 --> 00:28:15,418
I know they liked you.

592
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:17,226
I felt so comfortable
around them.

593
00:28:17,265 --> 00:28:18,256
I didn't have to worry

594
00:28:18,302 --> 00:28:20,239
that someone was going
to throw a tantrum

595
00:28:20,273 --> 00:28:22,073
or break into tears
all of a sudden.

596
00:28:22,112 --> 00:28:24,641
They only usually do
that at staff meetings.

597
00:28:25,988 --> 00:28:27,457
Jack's always talking

598
00:28:27,526 --> 00:28:30,466
about how we're better
than normal people.

599
00:28:30,567 --> 00:28:34,304
He says that's why
they keep us locked up

600
00:28:34,344 --> 00:28:35,870
but he's wrong.

601
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:37,714
He couldn't get by
in the real world.

602
00:28:37,752 --> 00:28:39,951
He'd get himself
into too much trouble.

603
00:28:39,992 --> 00:28:42,088
So would Lauren and Patrick.

604
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,898
That's why they belong
in the Institute.

605
00:28:44,937 --> 00:28:47,501
In fact, Doctor Loews wants
me to get them back there

606
00:28:47,578 --> 00:28:48,604
as soon as possible.

607
00:28:49,984 --> 00:28:52,046
I'm not going with them, am I?

608
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:54,324
You don't belong there...

609
00:28:54,362 --> 00:28:55,831
not anymore.

610
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,038
Do they know?

611
00:28:58,071 --> 00:28:59,301
Not yet.

612
00:29:01,547 --> 00:29:04,988
They've been like a family to me
for as long as I can remember.

613
00:29:05,023 --> 00:29:07,291
I know how much
you care about them.

614
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:10,502
As difficult as they
can be sometimes

615
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:12,507
I'm going to miss them.

616
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:15,745
We had our own little world,
just the four of us.

617
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,896
So what's a genetically
enhanced girl supposed to do

618
00:29:20,931 --> 00:29:22,902
when she wakes up
from a long sleep?

619
00:29:24,373 --> 00:29:27,313
Point to one of those little
specks of light out there

620
00:29:27,347 --> 00:29:31,882
pack a bag and go
make a life for herself?

621
00:29:31,927 --> 00:29:34,695
Why does she have to go
anywhere at all?

622
00:29:53,499 --> 00:29:55,299
Sarina isn't going back
to the Institute with you.

623
00:29:55,337 --> 00:29:56,306
She's not?

624
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,570
No, she's staying here.

625
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:00,607
Oh, really? Huh.
How nice for you.

626
00:30:00,651 --> 00:30:02,885
I've arranged for her
to have her own quarters.

627
00:30:02,924 --> 00:30:04,393
We're never going
to see her again.

628
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:05,794
You have no right to do this...
no right.

629
00:30:05,831 --> 00:30:07,802
Look, I know you're going
to miss her, but it's

630
00:30:07,836 --> 00:30:08,805
the best thing for Sarina.

631
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:09,808
We did not help you

632
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,401
so you could take
her away from us.

633
00:30:11,446 --> 00:30:13,212
Stop thinking about
yourself for a second

634
00:30:13,251 --> 00:30:15,017
Jack, and think about her.

635
00:30:15,122 --> 00:30:17,025
Face it. She doesn't
belong with you anymore.

636
00:30:17,094 --> 00:30:18,027
Why?

637
00:30:18,096 --> 00:30:19,156
Because we're not normal?

638
00:30:19,199 --> 00:30:20,190
Because we're crazy?

639
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,329
Oh, Jack.

640
00:30:21,372 --> 00:30:23,172
Couldn't you make us
normal like you did

641
00:30:23,209 --> 00:30:24,975
for Sarina and then we
could all stay together?

642
00:30:25,014 --> 00:30:25,983
Go on, Julian.

643
00:30:26,017 --> 00:30:26,986
Tell them.

644
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,546
There's nothing
you can do for us.

645
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,581
We're too far gone.

646
00:30:31,063 --> 00:30:32,863
Ah, who wants to be normal
anyway?

647
00:30:32,901 --> 00:30:34,929
We're better than they are.

648
00:30:34,973 --> 00:30:36,967
You don't see any of them
trying to save the universe

649
00:30:37,013 --> 00:30:38,277
from collapsing, do you?
Hmm? Hmm?

650
00:30:39,552 --> 00:30:41,021
Let's get back to work.

651
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:53,647
Well, they took it rather hard.

652
00:30:53,689 --> 00:30:55,353
I should go talk to them.

653
00:30:55,393 --> 00:30:56,589
In the morning.

654
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:59,832
Give them a little time
to get used to the idea.

655
00:31:01,643 --> 00:31:04,445
Come on. I've got just
the thing to cheer you up.

656
00:31:09,496 --> 00:31:11,433
Dabo!

657
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:13,565
She's unbelievable.

658
00:31:13,607 --> 00:31:15,305
Tell them how you do it.

659
00:31:15,345 --> 00:31:16,837
Go on!

660
00:31:16,882 --> 00:31:19,320
It has to do with a series
of binomial equations

661
00:31:19,355 --> 00:31:20,551
and probability factors.

662
00:31:20,592 --> 00:31:23,121
Explain how you track
the dependent variables.

663
00:31:23,165 --> 00:31:25,136
It's really not
that interesting.

664
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:26,730
Dabo!

665
00:31:29,114 --> 00:31:32,749
Well, hasn't this been fun?

666
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:35,127
Why not take a seat
and top off the evening

667
00:31:35,163 --> 00:31:37,761
with a lovely bottle
of spring wine?

668
00:31:37,804 --> 00:31:39,000
Should we?

669
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,441
He just wants you
to stop playing

670
00:31:40,477 --> 00:31:41,946
so he doesn't lose
any more money.

671
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:45,945
Did I mention
that the wine was on the house?

672
00:31:45,991 --> 00:31:47,859
Julian, let's sit down.

673
00:31:47,896 --> 00:31:49,126
But she's winning.

674
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:50,830
I've... played enough.

675
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:56,345
This way, this way.

676
00:31:56,384 --> 00:31:58,184
Uh, excuse me, excuse me.

677
00:31:58,223 --> 00:31:59,590
Uh, uh, Ezri, over here.

678
00:32:02,066 --> 00:32:04,003
Dabo!

679
00:32:12,794 --> 00:32:13,785
Sarina?

680
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:15,995
This way.

681
00:32:17,138 --> 00:32:19,610
Julian, would you mind
if we left?

682
00:32:28,635 --> 00:32:30,435
Oh, I'm sorry.

683
00:32:30,473 --> 00:32:31,942
I thought you were
having a good time.

684
00:32:31,977 --> 00:32:34,883
Oh, I was, but there
was so much commotion.

685
00:32:34,918 --> 00:32:37,254
Maybe I'm just tired.

686
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:38,886
I'll tell you what.

687
00:32:38,928 --> 00:32:40,558
Tomorrow night,
why don't we have

688
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:42,433
a nice, quiet dinner
in my quarters?

689
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,704
I have a week's leave coming up.

690
00:32:44,744 --> 00:32:46,442
I thought we might go
to Risa together

691
00:32:46,481 --> 00:32:49,113
get away from all
the distractions around here

692
00:32:49,155 --> 00:32:50,249
spend a little time alone.

693
00:32:50,291 --> 00:32:52,023
All right.

694
00:32:52,062 --> 00:32:53,657
I'll let you get some rest then.

695
00:33:11,212 --> 00:33:12,613
She's wonderful, Miles.

696
00:33:12,649 --> 00:33:14,985
I've never met
anybody like her.

697
00:33:15,022 --> 00:33:17,620
She's brilliant, sweet...

698
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:18,631
everything's new to her.

699
00:33:18,665 --> 00:33:20,967
Being with her
is so refreshing.

700
00:33:21,004 --> 00:33:23,910
She takes such delight
in what she's experiencing.

701
00:33:23,945 --> 00:33:27,010
It makes me appreciate things
I usually take for granted.

702
00:33:27,053 --> 00:33:28,420
Like hot coffee?

703
00:33:28,457 --> 00:33:30,621
Like coffee... music...

704
00:33:30,663 --> 00:33:32,064
the way the stars shine.

705
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,094
What is wrong with this thing?

706
00:33:34,138 --> 00:33:35,607
Are you listening to me?

707
00:33:35,642 --> 00:33:36,702
Yes.

708
00:33:36,745 --> 00:33:38,009
Yeah.

709
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:39,644
Coffee, music, stars.

710
00:33:40,655 --> 00:33:42,319
Well, don't you have
anything to say?

711
00:33:43,429 --> 00:33:45,366
As a matter of fact,
I do, Julian.

712
00:33:45,468 --> 00:33:48,909
I haven't seen you like this
for a long time

713
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:51,005
and I'm really happy for you

714
00:33:51,048 --> 00:33:52,017
but don't you think

715
00:33:52,051 --> 00:33:53,646
it's all happening
just a little too fast?

716
00:33:53,689 --> 00:33:55,387
Well, we're genetically
engineered.

717
00:33:55,426 --> 00:33:56,520
We do everything fast.

718
00:33:58,101 --> 00:34:00,630
Julian, she's your patient.

719
00:34:00,674 --> 00:34:01,643
Not anymore.

720
00:34:01,676 --> 00:34:03,510
I've asked Doctor Girani
to take over her care.

721
00:34:06,289 --> 00:34:08,283
Miles, I don't think
you understand

722
00:34:08,327 --> 00:34:09,660
what this means to me.

723
00:34:09,697 --> 00:34:12,067
All these years
I've had to hide the fact

724
00:34:12,103 --> 00:34:13,767
that my DNA
had been re-sequenced.

725
00:34:13,808 --> 00:34:15,972
I listened to people talk
about the genetically engineered

726
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:17,779
saying they were all misfits.

727
00:34:17,818 --> 00:34:19,789
I used to fantasize
about meeting someone

728
00:34:19,823 --> 00:34:22,591
who was like me,
who could live a normal life

729
00:34:22,631 --> 00:34:24,191
but it never happened...

730
00:34:24,236 --> 00:34:26,070
until Sarina.

731
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:27,974
Don't you see?

732
00:34:28,012 --> 00:34:30,814
She's the woman I've been
waiting for all my life.

733
00:34:33,525 --> 00:34:35,051
Well, good luck.

734
00:34:42,059 --> 00:34:43,689
Computer...

735
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:45,360
music.

736
00:34:45,401 --> 00:34:47,839
Something... romantic.

737
00:34:59,538 --> 00:35:02,637
Computer, locate Sarina Douglas.

738
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:04,513
Sarina Douglas
is in her quarters

739
00:35:04,551 --> 00:35:10,055
on the Habitat Ring, corridor
H-6, section 27-Epsilon.

740
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,731
Sarina!

741
00:35:22,765 --> 00:35:24,098
It's me.

742
00:35:26,909 --> 00:35:28,880
Computer, override door locks.

743
00:35:28,914 --> 00:35:31,752
Authorization:
Bashir-delta-five-seven-alpha.

744
00:35:43,151 --> 00:35:45,989
I've been waiting
in my quarters for you.

745
00:35:47,763 --> 00:35:48,857
Sarina?

746
00:35:56,786 --> 00:35:57,777
Is something wrong?

747
00:36:03,136 --> 00:36:04,469
Sarina.

748
00:36:15,268 --> 00:36:17,763
Apparently, the thalamic
pathways I generated

749
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:19,038
are still functioning

750
00:36:19,078 --> 00:36:21,880
but Dr. Girani's not detected
any neural activity in them.

751
00:36:21,918 --> 00:36:24,048
Do you have any idea
what's wrong?

752
00:36:24,091 --> 00:36:25,424
Not a clue.

753
00:36:25,461 --> 00:36:26,725
It's as if she were
just slipping away

754
00:36:26,764 --> 00:36:27,733
and there's nothing I can do

755
00:36:27,767 --> 00:36:29,465
but wait and hope
she pulls out of it.

756
00:36:29,505 --> 00:36:30,633
You can go in now.

757
00:36:34,518 --> 00:36:36,455
Sarina?

758
00:36:37,793 --> 00:36:39,661
Don't be afraid.

759
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:42,934
Everything's going
to be all right.

760
00:36:44,878 --> 00:36:48,284
I'm not going
to give up on you... ever.

761
00:37:10,244 --> 00:37:12,215
I don't know
what's wrong with her.

762
00:37:12,249 --> 00:37:13,218
I need your help.

763
00:37:13,251 --> 00:37:14,481
Why should we help you?

764
00:37:14,522 --> 00:37:16,048
You just want to steal
her away from us.

765
00:37:16,092 --> 00:37:17,254
Look at her!

766
00:37:17,295 --> 00:37:18,628
Do you really want her

767
00:37:18,665 --> 00:37:21,137
to spend the rest
of her life like this?

768
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:23,166
I mean, I've been
trying to find a way

769
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:24,645
to reach her, but I can't.

770
00:37:24,681 --> 00:37:26,276
Maybe there isn't one.

771
00:37:26,318 --> 00:37:30,283
All I'm asking is that you try.

772
00:37:30,329 --> 00:37:33,360
The three of you know her
better than anyone else.

773
00:37:33,404 --> 00:37:37,437
Please... I don't
want to lose her.

774
00:37:40,722 --> 00:37:41,713
All right, Julian.

775
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,753
Leave her here with us
for a while.

776
00:37:43,797 --> 00:37:45,357
We'll see what we can do.

777
00:37:45,402 --> 00:37:47,636
Thank you.

778
00:38:18,454 --> 00:38:19,821
Are you sure?

779
00:38:19,858 --> 00:38:21,122
I'm sure.

780
00:38:21,161 --> 00:38:22,893
We have to tell him.

781
00:38:22,932 --> 00:38:25,062
Why? This way, we can
all stay together.

782
00:38:27,477 --> 00:38:28,810
Let's go.

783
00:38:41,313 --> 00:38:42,282
This way.

784
00:38:42,316 --> 00:38:43,285
That way.

785
00:38:43,318 --> 00:38:44,651
I think we passed it.

786
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:45,919
Can I help you?

787
00:38:47,196 --> 00:38:49,634
That's a stupid question.

788
00:39:01,365 --> 00:39:02,629
Come in.

789
00:39:04,306 --> 00:39:05,434
We have to talk to you.

790
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:07,379
About Sarina?

791
00:39:07,414 --> 00:39:09,282
Tell him.

792
00:39:09,319 --> 00:39:10,845
She can still talk.

793
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,362
It's just that she's afraid to.

794
00:39:13,396 --> 00:39:14,456
I don't understand.

795
00:39:14,499 --> 00:39:15,763
What is she afraid of?

796
00:39:15,802 --> 00:39:16,771
We don't know.

797
00:39:16,805 --> 00:39:18,708
But we think it has something
to do with you.

798
00:39:20,582 --> 00:39:21,608
I'm going to talk to her.

799
00:39:21,652 --> 00:39:23,019
Stay here.

800
00:39:28,101 --> 00:39:29,593
Sarina.

801
00:39:31,611 --> 00:39:33,548
Talk to me...

802
00:39:33,616 --> 00:39:35,211
please.

803
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:39,596
I know you can.

804
00:39:44,878 --> 00:39:46,438
What's wrong?

805
00:39:50,292 --> 00:39:52,388
Is it me?

806
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:55,029
If it is, don't be afraid.

807
00:39:55,071 --> 00:39:57,543
I'm going to do
whatever it takes

808
00:39:57,578 --> 00:39:59,606
to make it right...

809
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:01,678
because I love you.

810
00:40:04,596 --> 00:40:06,795
I want us to be together.

811
00:40:09,342 --> 00:40:11,006
Tell me.

812
00:40:13,085 --> 00:40:15,147
Do you love me?

813
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,871
I don't know.

814
00:40:22,342 --> 00:40:26,513
I don't even understand
what love is.

815
00:40:26,553 --> 00:40:28,353
I don't understand anything.

816
00:40:28,391 --> 00:40:29,360
Sarina...

817
00:40:29,394 --> 00:40:30,385
What am I supposed to do?

818
00:40:30,429 --> 00:40:32,195
What am I supposed to feel?

819
00:40:32,234 --> 00:40:33,203
Tell me.

820
00:40:33,237 --> 00:40:34,604
I want to make you happy.

821
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,836
I owe you everything.

822
00:40:35,877 --> 00:40:38,281
Shh. You don't owe me.

823
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,348
You don't owe me anything.

824
00:40:43,765 --> 00:40:46,033
I'm sorry.

825
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:48,634
I wish I could be the woman
you want me to be.

826
00:40:48,677 --> 00:40:49,668
Shh.

827
00:41:09,865 --> 00:41:12,394
Morning.

828
00:41:12,439 --> 00:41:13,738
Is she gone?

829
00:41:13,776 --> 00:41:16,271
Her shuttle leaves
in a few minutes.

830
00:41:16,316 --> 00:41:17,751
What about the others?

831
00:41:17,786 --> 00:41:21,284
They left for the Institute
this morning.

832
00:41:23,668 --> 00:41:26,197
I understand you've arranged
a position for Sarina

833
00:41:26,242 --> 00:41:28,476
at the Corgal Research Center.

834
00:41:28,513 --> 00:41:29,982
Yeah, an internship.

835
00:41:30,018 --> 00:41:31,317
She's going to work

836
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:33,155
under one
of the scientists there

837
00:41:33,193 --> 00:41:34,891
live with his family.

838
00:41:36,836 --> 00:41:37,896
Are you okay?

839
00:41:40,278 --> 00:41:42,750
How could I have been so blind?

840
00:41:42,784 --> 00:41:44,253
What was I thinking

841
00:41:44,288 --> 00:41:46,522
trying to move things
along so fast?

842
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,824
She needed time.

843
00:41:47,897 --> 00:41:49,196
I didn't give it to her.

844
00:41:49,234 --> 00:41:50,703
I came this close

845
00:41:50,738 --> 00:41:53,644
to driving her back
inside herself.

846
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:55,650
I'm supposed to be a doctor.

847
00:41:55,685 --> 00:41:58,283
I'm supposed to put
a patient's needs above my own.

848
00:41:58,325 --> 00:42:00,923
You didn't want
to be lonely anymore.

849
00:42:00,965 --> 00:42:02,298
Nobody does.

850
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:09,509
I have to go to work.

851
00:42:11,292 --> 00:42:13,594
You want to come over
for dinner tonight?

852
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:15,396
Keiko's making tempura.

853
00:42:17,708 --> 00:42:18,870
No, thanks.

854
00:42:44,411 --> 00:42:46,849
So here you are...

855
00:42:46,883 --> 00:42:47,909
on your way to one

856
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:50,892
of those tiny little specks
of light out there.

857
00:42:52,131 --> 00:42:54,831
I guess that's what a
genetically enhanced girl

858
00:42:54,871 --> 00:42:57,902
should do when she wakes up
from her sleep...

859
00:42:57,946 --> 00:43:00,282
go make a life for herself.

860
00:43:05,632 --> 00:43:07,296
I'm going to miss you.

861
00:43:07,337 --> 00:43:09,969
I'm going to miss you.

862
00:43:11,013 --> 00:43:12,573
You won't forget me?

863
00:43:12,618 --> 00:43:14,612
Forget you?

864
00:43:14,656 --> 00:43:16,388
Never.

865
00:43:17,429 --> 00:43:19,924
Final boarding call.

866
00:43:20,003 --> 00:43:22,635
Well, I'd better go.
