1
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:11,843
Computer,
set heading 410 mark 32.

2
00:00:11,882 --> 00:00:13,852
Course laid in.

3
00:00:13,886 --> 00:00:16,858
Maximum warp.
Engage.

4
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:18,862
Time to Parada system.

5
00:00:18,896 --> 00:00:21,230
One hour, 14 minutes.

6
00:00:26,578 --> 00:00:28,912
Open a new file, computer.

7
00:00:30,653 --> 00:00:35,595
O'Brien, Personal Log,
Stardate 47581.2.

8
00:00:40,272 --> 00:00:43,574
I've got to try to set
the record straight

9
00:00:43,612 --> 00:00:45,741
about the last 52 hours.

10
00:00:47,286 --> 00:00:49,347
I don't know
who's going to hear this.

11
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,593
I don't even know
if I'll be alive

12
00:00:54,634 --> 00:00:56,661
by the time
this log is recovered.

13
00:00:58,341 --> 00:01:01,541
I figure
they'll be coming after me.

14
00:01:01,582 --> 00:01:04,554
If I'm right
about this whole thing

15
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:08,392
they won't want me
to warn the Paradas.

16
00:01:08,428 --> 00:01:11,867
Coffee, Jamaican blend...
double strong, double sweet.

17
00:01:14,573 --> 00:01:18,068
I wish I could tell you
who they are

18
00:01:18,114 --> 00:01:22,954
but that's a part of the puzzle
I haven't figured out yet.

19
00:01:22,991 --> 00:01:25,986
A part of the puzzle, hell.

20
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:29,800
None of this whole damn thing
makes any sense.

21
00:01:35,983 --> 00:01:38,249
I'm trying to remember

22
00:01:38,288 --> 00:01:43,253
the first time I noticed
that things were wrong.

23
00:01:43,298 --> 00:01:46,168
It seems to me it was...

24
00:01:46,204 --> 00:01:48,401
Yeah...

25
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,206
it had to be the first morning

26
00:01:50,245 --> 00:01:52,215
after I got back
to the station.

27
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,290
What are you two
doing up so early?

28
00:02:13,324 --> 00:02:17,959
Um, I had a lot of work
to catch up on at school.

29
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:20,164
Thought I'd get an early start.

30
00:02:20,205 --> 00:02:22,141
At 5:30 in the morning?

31
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:25,306
Coffee, Jamaican blend...
double strong, double sweet.

32
00:02:25,348 --> 00:02:27,750
I have a dozen essays to read.

33
00:02:29,323 --> 00:02:31,988
Did you have sweet dreams,
darling?

34
00:02:32,029 --> 00:02:33,999
Go away!

35
00:02:34,033 --> 00:02:35,832
Don't I get my morning kiss?

36
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,840
No!

37
00:02:37,874 --> 00:02:41,040
Well, what did I do
to deserve that?

38
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,947
It's just a phase, Miles.

39
00:02:42,984 --> 00:02:44,179
She doesn't mean it.

40
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:45,346
Huh?!

41
00:02:45,422 --> 00:02:47,824
Don't let it bother you.

42
00:02:53,404 --> 00:02:57,037
What time did you
get to bed last night?

43
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,844
I don't know... late.

44
00:02:58,882 --> 00:03:00,818
I didn't want to wake you.

45
00:03:00,853 --> 00:03:01,980
I was tired.

46
00:03:02,022 --> 00:03:05,324
I guess that trip
really took it out of me.

47
00:03:05,362 --> 00:03:07,332
What did they have you doing?

48
00:03:07,366 --> 00:03:08,664
The Paradas?

49
00:03:08,702 --> 00:03:10,831
They put me
through basic training

50
00:03:10,873 --> 00:03:12,341
on all the security measures

51
00:03:12,376 --> 00:03:14,869
they want in place
for the peace talks.

52
00:03:14,914 --> 00:03:16,941
Odo would have had a field day.

53
00:03:16,985 --> 00:03:19,012
I wish he could have been there.

54
00:03:19,056 --> 00:03:21,026
I'd better get going.

55
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,089
I'll drop Molly at day care
on the way to Ops.

56
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:25,693
Uh, that's okay.

57
00:03:25,736 --> 00:03:27,365
I'm taking her with me.
Molly?

58
00:03:27,406 --> 00:03:28,874
What? To school?

59
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:30,902
When you've got
all that reading to do?

60
00:03:30,946 --> 00:03:32,711
That doesn't make
a lot of sense.

61
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,720
There's something
I want to show her.

62
00:03:34,754 --> 00:03:36,017
Uh, a Vulcan program

63
00:03:36,057 --> 00:03:38,186
that teaches basic
problem-solving skills.

64
00:03:38,227 --> 00:03:40,926
At 5:30 in the morning?

65
00:03:40,966 --> 00:03:43,402
I want to do it
while her mind is fresh.

66
00:03:43,471 --> 00:03:46,238
Oh, if you say so.

67
00:03:46,277 --> 00:03:47,974
See you later.

68
00:04:12,095 --> 00:04:13,563
What's this?

69
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:15,966
Just getting a head start,
Chief.

70
00:04:16,003 --> 00:04:18,303
Head start?
Everybody seems to be getting

71
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,277
a head start on me today.

72
00:04:20,311 --> 00:04:21,745
Sir?

73
00:04:21,782 --> 00:04:26,223
DeCurtis, I appreciate
your bushy-tailed enthusiasm

74
00:04:26,257 --> 00:04:27,725
but I was waiting for Odo

75
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,820
to come back from Bajor
to do this.

76
00:04:29,864 --> 00:04:32,334
We have to realign
the entire security net

77
00:04:32,369 --> 00:04:33,564
for the peace talks.

78
00:04:33,604 --> 00:04:35,038
The Constable might have

79
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:37,010
a few things
to say about it all.

80
00:04:37,045 --> 00:04:40,381
Commander Sisko didn't feel
we should wait for Odo.

81
00:04:40,418 --> 00:04:43,151
Sisko gave you permission
to start this

82
00:04:43,191 --> 00:04:44,922
without asking me first?

83
00:04:44,961 --> 00:04:46,190
I don't think so.

84
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,598
You might want to check
with him, sir.

85
00:04:48,634 --> 00:04:50,068
I'm only following orders.

86
00:04:50,104 --> 00:04:53,133
I'll check with him, all right.

87
00:04:53,177 --> 00:04:54,806
Mr. O'Brien?

88
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,815
Carry on!

89
00:07:30,295 --> 00:07:32,595
Computer, how much longer
to Parada system?

90
00:07:32,633 --> 00:07:34,500
53 minutes.

91
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,270
Direct sensors
back toward the wormhole.

92
00:07:37,309 --> 00:07:40,874
Scan for other warp signatures
on this heading.

93
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,783
One warp signature found.

94
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,553
Display.

95
00:07:45,592 --> 00:07:47,892
Can you identify?

96
00:07:47,998 --> 00:07:51,232
Identification confirmed:
Starfleet Runabout <i>Mekong.</i>

97
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:52,637
Ah, I figured as much.

98
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:56,636
They'll wait for me
to drop out of warp and then...

99
00:07:56,681 --> 00:07:58,913
Well, we'll have
to cross that bridge

100
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,922
when we come to it, won't we?

101
00:08:00,956 --> 00:08:02,585
Please restate question.

102
00:08:02,626 --> 00:08:05,530
Oh, disregard, computer.

103
00:08:07,436 --> 00:08:09,269
Continue Personal Log.

104
00:08:11,711 --> 00:08:15,047
Okay...

105
00:08:15,085 --> 00:08:19,458
So, it was all a little curious

106
00:08:19,493 --> 00:08:22,158
but who could have guessed
at that time?

107
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:24,635
I mean, the way they were acting

108
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,004
they might have been trying
to pull off

109
00:08:27,042 --> 00:08:29,912
one of those surprise parties
that I can't stand.

110
00:08:29,981 --> 00:08:32,281
Only my birthday's
not until September

111
00:08:32,319 --> 00:08:34,221
and, believe me,
as it turned out

112
00:08:34,256 --> 00:08:37,422
I had nothing else to celebrate.

113
00:08:37,463 --> 00:08:38,431
Ah, there he is now.

114
00:08:38,465 --> 00:08:39,831
I've been waiting for you,
Chief.

115
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:40,835
What is it, Julian?

116
00:08:40,869 --> 00:08:42,030
No more excuses this time.

117
00:08:42,072 --> 00:08:43,040
Excuses?

118
00:08:43,074 --> 00:08:44,668
I'd like you
in my office in an hour.

119
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:45,678
For what?

120
00:08:45,712 --> 00:08:46,805
Your physical.

121
00:08:46,848 --> 00:08:48,282
You can't put this off
any longer.

122
00:08:48,318 --> 00:08:49,513
Look, this isn't a good day.

123
00:08:49,553 --> 00:08:50,646
It's the perfect day.

124
00:08:50,689 --> 00:08:53,252
Commander Sisko has arranged
to have you covered.

125
00:08:53,294 --> 00:08:54,957
What are you doing,
going to the Commander

126
00:08:54,997 --> 00:08:55,965
about my checkup?

127
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:57,558
Because this has been...

128
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:59,368
I know how you feel about...

129
00:08:59,407 --> 00:09:00,807
Forget it.

130
00:09:00,842 --> 00:09:02,471
I've got things to do.

131
00:09:02,513 --> 00:09:04,483
I'm afraid I'll have to insist.

132
00:09:04,517 --> 00:09:07,148
If I have to order you
as your superior officer

133
00:09:07,189 --> 00:09:08,316
I will.

134
00:09:08,358 --> 00:09:09,884
Is there a problem?

135
00:09:11,264 --> 00:09:16,104
Mr. O'Brien says
he's unavailable for a physical.

136
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,871
Make yourself available, Chief.

137
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,709
- Commander...
- Dr. Bashir's annual report

138
00:09:19,747 --> 00:09:23,186
on the senior staff is due
at Starfleet next week.

139
00:09:23,221 --> 00:09:25,852
We've all had
to go through this.

140
00:09:25,892 --> 00:09:29,023
Fine. Fine.
I'll be there in an hour.

141
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:36,503
Commander, can I talk
to you for a minute?

142
00:09:40,655 --> 00:09:44,561
Ensign DeCurtis mentioned to me
that you were a little upset.

143
00:09:44,597 --> 00:09:45,963
Well, not upset, exactly.

144
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:48,094
No, no, no.
You have every right to be.

145
00:09:48,138 --> 00:09:50,574
I'm sorry I assigned him
before advising you.

146
00:09:50,609 --> 00:09:52,738
I guess I dropped
the ball on that one.

147
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:53,940
Well, I guess I just felt

148
00:09:53,982 --> 00:09:55,918
a little left out
of the loop, you know?

149
00:09:55,952 --> 00:09:57,250
Understood.

150
00:09:57,289 --> 00:09:59,589
I've gone through your reports
on the Paradas.

151
00:09:59,627 --> 00:10:01,756
They seem unusually preoccupied
with security.

152
00:10:01,797 --> 00:10:03,767
Well, they may be
a little paranoid

153
00:10:03,801 --> 00:10:05,464
but I suppose we would be, too

154
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:08,375
if we'd been engaged
in a civil war for 12 years.

155
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,209
Anything else I should
know about them?

156
00:10:12,252 --> 00:10:13,447
Any unusual protocols

157
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,458
we should observe
when they get here?

158
00:10:15,492 --> 00:10:17,291
No, nothing
too out of the ordinary.

159
00:10:17,329 --> 00:10:18,763
It's all pretty much
in my report.

160
00:10:18,798 --> 00:10:23,068
Now, tell me something
that's not in the report.

161
00:10:23,174 --> 00:10:24,608
Sir?

162
00:10:24,643 --> 00:10:27,079
You know, the kinds of things
we don't include in reports

163
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:28,617
but might help me
in these talks.

164
00:10:28,651 --> 00:10:31,589
Well, I'd have to give it
some thought.

165
00:10:31,624 --> 00:10:34,357
Well, there was one thing
I noticed.

166
00:10:34,396 --> 00:10:37,891
Well, I don't know if it means
anything or not

167
00:10:37,936 --> 00:10:40,099
but the Paradas have an odor

168
00:10:40,175 --> 00:10:43,614
from some kind of skin
excretions, I'd guess.

169
00:10:43,648 --> 00:10:45,242
It changes with their moods.

170
00:10:45,285 --> 00:10:48,485
When they're upset, it can get
pretty strong, actually.

171
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:51,860
Oh, well, I'll try
not to get them upset.

172
00:10:51,897 --> 00:10:53,560
Good idea.

173
00:10:53,601 --> 00:10:55,798
Their leaders have been
in regular contact with us.

174
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,365
I've assured them
we'll be following

175
00:10:57,409 --> 00:10:59,709
all of their security
recommendations to the letter.

176
00:10:59,747 --> 00:11:02,013
I'll see to that.

177
00:11:02,051 --> 00:11:04,021
Well, I certainly want you
to check everything

178
00:11:04,055 --> 00:11:05,922
before they get here,
but the up-front work

179
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:07,553
can be done
by the engineering crews.

180
00:11:07,596 --> 00:11:08,962
I have bigger problems for you.

181
00:11:08,998 --> 00:11:10,763
Bigger?

182
00:11:10,802 --> 00:11:13,034
All three upper pylons
are down again.

183
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:14,268
Well, that's impossible.

184
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,111
I went over that repair work
when I got back.

185
00:11:17,215 --> 00:11:20,551
The pressure locks seemed
to be at maximum efficiency.

186
00:11:20,588 --> 00:11:21,715
You'd better check again.

187
00:11:21,757 --> 00:11:23,317
We had to tow in
a Bolian freighter

188
00:11:23,361 --> 00:11:24,693
to a lower dock this morning.

189
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:27,531
Well, it can't be anything
that serious.

190
00:11:27,569 --> 00:11:30,302
I rebuilt
that entire subsystem myself.

191
00:11:30,342 --> 00:11:32,141
I'll get on it right away.

192
00:11:32,245 --> 00:11:34,545
After your physical.

193
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,143
Yes, sir.

194
00:11:36,253 --> 00:11:39,054
By the way,
I noticed you and Keiko

195
00:11:39,092 --> 00:11:42,326
out in front of the school
this morning, talking.

196
00:11:42,366 --> 00:11:43,926
Is there anything wrong?

197
00:11:43,968 --> 00:11:47,372
Oh, Jake is having some problems
with his grades.

198
00:11:47,409 --> 00:11:49,311
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, sir.

199
00:11:49,346 --> 00:11:51,043
Keiko's very fond of the boy.

200
00:11:51,082 --> 00:11:54,054
I'm sure she'll work
that much harder to help him.

201
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,614
I'm sure she will.

202
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,847
Are you nearly finished?

203
00:12:09,887 --> 00:12:13,588
I believe you've poked
into every orifice in my body

204
00:12:13,628 --> 00:12:15,598
and created a few new ones.

205
00:12:15,632 --> 00:12:18,297
Any dizziness?
Oversleeping?

206
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:20,739
Lack of energy?
Euphoria?

207
00:12:20,775 --> 00:12:21,868
Yes! All of them!

208
00:12:21,911 --> 00:12:24,177
Especially euphoria,
lots of euphoria!

209
00:12:24,283 --> 00:12:25,751
Seriously.

210
00:12:25,785 --> 00:12:27,948
Look, if you are determined
to keep me here

211
00:12:27,989 --> 00:12:29,925
until you find
something wrong with me

212
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,930
I'll see if I can't grow you
a hangnail!

213
00:12:31,964 --> 00:12:33,593
Eye problems?
Hearing? Headaches?

214
00:12:33,634 --> 00:12:35,034
Headache... there you go!

215
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,099
In fact, I'm getting
a very bad one right now.

216
00:12:38,143 --> 00:12:39,874
Short temper.

217
00:12:39,913 --> 00:12:43,181
Flies off the handle under
the slightest provocation...

218
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,951
perfectly normal behavior.

219
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,960
Ah, I'm glad
you're enjoying this.

220
00:12:46,994 --> 00:12:49,625
Sorry. I know how you feel
about doctors.

221
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:52,229
It's not doctors
I have a problem with.

222
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:53,968
It's you, Julian.

223
00:12:54,008 --> 00:12:56,240
Well, your sense of humor
seems normal enough.

224
00:12:56,347 --> 00:12:57,815
I don't have a sense of humor.

225
00:12:57,849 --> 00:12:58,874
Cough.

226
00:12:59,887 --> 00:13:01,082
How's the sex life?

227
00:13:01,122 --> 00:13:03,092
I don't have a sense of humor.

228
00:13:03,126 --> 00:13:04,116
Cough!

229
00:13:05,465 --> 00:13:07,196
Everything all right
in that department?

230
00:13:07,302 --> 00:13:11,106
That department is none of
Starfleet's business, or yours.

231
00:13:11,142 --> 00:13:12,805
Mother and father
in good health?

232
00:13:12,846 --> 00:13:14,007
Oh, come on, Julian!

233
00:13:14,048 --> 00:13:15,881
You knew my mother died
two years ago.

234
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:16,944
Did I?

235
00:13:16,987 --> 00:13:18,957
You don't remember me
telling you

236
00:13:18,991 --> 00:13:20,961
when my father
remarried last spring?

237
00:13:20,995 --> 00:13:25,026
Me blathering on about this
woman I've never met before?

238
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,869
Of course.

239
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:28,809
Now I remember.

240
00:13:28,844 --> 00:13:30,142
Are you finished?

241
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,478
Not quite.

242
00:13:31,517 --> 00:13:32,985
I just have

243
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:35,114
one or two more tests to run.

244
00:13:35,157 --> 00:13:37,525
This is insane.

245
00:13:37,562 --> 00:13:41,263
I haven't had a physical
take this long since I was born.

246
00:13:41,302 --> 00:13:43,602
Look, unless I'm dying
or something

247
00:13:43,641 --> 00:13:45,406
I think it's about time...

248
00:13:45,445 --> 00:13:47,677
Wait.

249
00:13:47,716 --> 00:13:49,276
That's it, isn't it?

250
00:13:49,386 --> 00:13:53,190
I mean, there is
something wrong with me.

251
00:13:53,226 --> 00:13:55,526
That's why everybody seems
so strange.

252
00:13:55,565 --> 00:13:58,765
Relax, Chief.

253
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:01,742
I'm giving you
a clean bill of health.

254
00:14:01,777 --> 00:14:03,406
You can get dressed.

255
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,581
Hey, Chief!

256
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,591
Hello, Jake.

257
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:20,684
I need a favor.

258
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:21,717
Sure, what is it?

259
00:14:21,762 --> 00:14:23,391
I'm working
on a subspace transceiver

260
00:14:23,432 --> 00:14:26,097
for my science project,
but I can't seem to figure out

261
00:14:26,137 --> 00:14:27,936
how to get the emitter
crystal to work.

262
00:14:27,974 --> 00:14:29,408
Subspace transceiver model...

263
00:14:29,444 --> 00:14:32,041
I used to build them
when I was your age.

264
00:14:32,082 --> 00:14:33,448
I'll be glad to help.

265
00:14:33,486 --> 00:14:35,422
You don't think
it's a conflict of interest

266
00:14:35,456 --> 00:14:37,585
or anything... you being
married to the teacher?

267
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,187
Oh, we'll have to clear it
with Keiko

268
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,493
but I don't think she'll mind.

269
00:14:40,533 --> 00:14:41,967
Besides, it's a chance
to help get

270
00:14:42,002 --> 00:14:43,596
those grades of yours back up,
right?

271
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:44,766
Oh, my grades are great.

272
00:14:44,808 --> 00:14:46,801
I just want to keep them
that way.

273
00:14:56,732 --> 00:14:59,829
Sisko was telling the truth
about one thing:

274
00:14:59,871 --> 00:15:01,841
The upper pylons
had failed again.

275
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,376
It didn't make any sense

276
00:15:03,412 --> 00:15:06,043
because the new pressure locks
I'd installed

277
00:15:06,084 --> 00:15:07,849
seemed to be working just fine

278
00:15:07,921 --> 00:15:10,323
so it had to be
an entirely new problem.

279
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:13,160
I realized it wasn't going
to be a quick matter

280
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:14,861
to track it down, after all.

281
00:15:14,901 --> 00:15:16,598
And I couldn't help thinking

282
00:15:16,638 --> 00:15:18,870
how this was going
to keep me occupied

283
00:15:18,943 --> 00:15:22,678
while the security arrangements
for the Paradas were underway.

284
00:15:29,498 --> 00:15:31,058
How's it coming, DeCurtis?

285
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,161
Chief, I thought
you had your hands full

286
00:15:33,204 --> 00:15:34,365
with the upper pylons.

287
00:15:34,407 --> 00:15:36,434
I do, but I thought
I'd take a break

288
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:37,776
check in on your progress.

289
00:15:37,814 --> 00:15:40,445
Everything's on schedule here.
We made a complete sweep

290
00:15:40,486 --> 00:15:42,615
of all the quarters
assigned to the Paradas.

291
00:15:42,657 --> 00:15:43,750
Good. Open it up.

292
00:15:43,793 --> 00:15:45,387
I'd like to look it over myself.

293
00:15:45,429 --> 00:15:46,397
I can't, Chief...

294
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,094
That's an order!

295
00:15:48,134 --> 00:15:50,536
Sir, the security seal
was activated

296
00:15:50,573 --> 00:15:52,041
the minute we left.

297
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,673
Only Major Kira
has the access codes.

298
00:15:54,714 --> 00:15:56,843
O'Brien to Kira.

299
00:15:56,885 --> 00:15:58,376
Go ahead, Chief.

300
00:15:58,421 --> 00:16:01,689
I'd like the access codes
to the Parada quarters.

301
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:04,198
Chief, what are you doing
down there?

302
00:16:04,233 --> 00:16:07,330
Commander, I spent
the last week going over

303
00:16:07,372 --> 00:16:10,003
these arrangements
with the Paradas.

304
00:16:10,045 --> 00:16:11,513
I really need to be...

305
00:16:11,548 --> 00:16:13,916
I want those upper pylons
operational, Chief.

306
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:15,579
That's your priority.

307
00:16:15,623 --> 00:16:17,456
Understood?

308
00:16:17,494 --> 00:16:19,657
Yes, sir.

309
00:16:48,421 --> 00:16:49,616
Chief!

310
00:16:49,658 --> 00:16:53,291
Is this the right inverter
for the subspace transceiver?

311
00:16:53,331 --> 00:16:56,497
Where did you get this?

312
00:16:56,538 --> 00:16:59,203
I haven't seen one of these
since I was a kid.

313
00:16:59,243 --> 00:17:00,336
I replicated it.

314
00:17:00,378 --> 00:17:01,539
I found the design

315
00:17:01,582 --> 00:17:03,211
in a really,
really old data file

316
00:17:03,251 --> 00:17:04,583
in the library program.

317
00:17:04,621 --> 00:17:05,850
Really, really old?

318
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:06,949
Oh, I didn't mean that...

319
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,358
Don't worry about it.

320
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:10,728
Why don't you come by
my place tonight after dinner?

321
00:17:10,766 --> 00:17:12,895
We'll see if we can add
the rest of the pieces.

322
00:17:12,937 --> 00:17:14,405
Oh, that's great.

323
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,310
Jake, did anything unusual
happen here at the station

324
00:17:17,346 --> 00:17:19,475
when I was
in the Gamma Quadrant last?

325
00:17:19,516 --> 00:17:21,577
Jake, your father's
been looking for you.

326
00:17:21,622 --> 00:17:23,216
I think he's back
in your quarters.

327
00:17:23,258 --> 00:17:25,751
It may be important.

328
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:27,561
See you later.

329
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,002
Everything under control, Chief?

330
00:17:31,207 --> 00:17:32,641
Under control, Major.

331
00:17:36,217 --> 00:17:40,521
I worked on the pylon controls
the better part of the day.

332
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:43,530
"A needle in a haystack"
wouldn't do this job justice.

333
00:17:43,565 --> 00:17:46,867
When I finally found the crack
in the RF power conduit.

334
00:17:46,905 --> 00:17:49,604
I couldn't imagine
how it could have occurred

335
00:17:49,644 --> 00:17:50,873
so deep in the system

336
00:17:50,913 --> 00:17:53,476
unless someone had broken
it deliberately.

337
00:18:02,202 --> 00:18:03,500
Hard day?

338
00:18:03,538 --> 00:18:05,337
Oh, yeah, you could say that.

339
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,504
You want to lie down
before dinner?

340
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:10,016
No, Jake's coming over
in a little while.

341
00:18:10,118 --> 00:18:13,022
I promised to help him
with his science project.

342
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:15,027
Uh, Commander Sisko just called.

343
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:16,758
Jake can't make it tonight.

344
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:18,198
He isn't feeling well.

345
00:18:18,234 --> 00:18:19,395
Really?

346
00:18:19,436 --> 00:18:21,167
He seemed okay a few hours ago.

347
00:18:21,207 --> 00:18:23,872
Well, you know
how it is with kids.

348
00:18:23,912 --> 00:18:26,543
He probably just
ate too much junk

349
00:18:26,584 --> 00:18:28,884
on the Promenade after school.

350
00:18:28,922 --> 00:18:30,220
Where's Molly?

351
00:18:30,258 --> 00:18:34,096
She's over at the Fredricksons
spending the night.

352
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:44,116
So, there's just
the two of us, then.

353
00:18:45,956 --> 00:18:49,521
We'd better eat while
the food's still warm.

354
00:18:49,563 --> 00:18:52,433
Well, the replicator
can keep it warm

355
00:18:52,469 --> 00:18:54,905
and I can keep you warm.

356
00:19:02,422 --> 00:19:03,948
What's the problem?

357
00:19:03,992 --> 00:19:06,224
No problem.

358
00:19:06,263 --> 00:19:09,064
Um, I'm just not in the mood.

359
00:19:09,102 --> 00:19:11,436
I had a hard day, too.

360
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:17,984
Okay, we'll eat.

361
00:19:22,797 --> 00:19:24,460
What is it?

362
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,094
Fricandeau stew.

363
00:19:26,136 --> 00:19:28,436
But you don't like
fricandeau stew.

364
00:19:28,474 --> 00:19:29,533
You do.

365
00:19:29,576 --> 00:19:30,942
Yeah, but...

366
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:34,316
I just thought you'd appreciate
one of your favorite meals.

367
00:19:34,353 --> 00:19:37,723
I know how you hate all that
terrible food when you're away.

368
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:43,932
A little endive salad,
sweet flan for dessert.

369
00:19:43,972 --> 00:19:45,942
How thoughtful of you.

370
00:19:49,616 --> 00:19:51,711
You're not having any?

371
00:19:53,224 --> 00:19:55,285
I just feel like having salad.

372
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:56,728
You're not hungry?

373
00:19:56,765 --> 00:19:58,792
I had a late lunch.

374
00:20:14,232 --> 00:20:16,361
How is it?

375
00:20:29,162 --> 00:20:33,034
You know,
I think I will lie down.

376
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,233
But you haven't eaten a bite.

377
00:20:35,308 --> 00:20:39,646
Ah, I just don't seem
to have an appetite right now.

378
00:20:43,624 --> 00:20:45,617
I don't know if there was

379
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,825
anything wrong with the stew
or not.

380
00:20:47,867 --> 00:20:49,769
When I went back later to check

381
00:20:49,804 --> 00:20:52,104
she'd already put it
into the disposal.

382
00:20:52,142 --> 00:20:54,841
But all I could think of,
as I looked at her

383
00:20:54,881 --> 00:20:58,320
was that this was not my Keiko.

384
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:12,931
Computer...

385
00:21:16,582 --> 00:21:19,782
open O'Brien Personal Log.

386
00:21:19,822 --> 00:21:22,817
Play back the last sentence.

387
00:21:22,862 --> 00:21:26,802
...but all I could think of
as I looked at her

388
00:21:26,836 --> 00:21:29,831
was that this was not my Keiko.

389
00:21:32,013 --> 00:21:35,179
You're right.

390
00:21:35,219 --> 00:21:37,782
She wasn't.

391
00:21:40,931 --> 00:21:42,924
Continue log.

392
00:21:46,008 --> 00:21:48,274
I didn't get much sleep
that night.

393
00:21:48,345 --> 00:21:50,976
I waited for Keiko...
or whoever she was...

394
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,488
to go to bed,
and I started my search.

395
00:21:53,522 --> 00:21:56,085
I had no idea
what I was looking for...

396
00:21:56,128 --> 00:21:58,964
something odd,
something not quite normal

397
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,904
anything to explain
what might be going on.

398
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,069
Scan complete.

399
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:07,241
No unknown microorganisms
detected.

400
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,913
Check for traces
of any chemical agents

401
00:22:09,956 --> 00:22:11,755
with bioactive properties.

402
00:22:11,792 --> 00:22:15,596
No chemical agents with
bioactive properties detected.

403
00:22:15,633 --> 00:22:17,660
Any unknown chemical agents?

404
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:19,537
Negative.

405
00:22:19,574 --> 00:22:22,546
Access internal EM sensor grid.

406
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,379
Ready.

407
00:22:24,417 --> 00:22:28,187
Scan for any evidence
of subharmonic transmissions.

408
00:22:28,225 --> 00:22:29,523
Scan complete.

409
00:22:29,561 --> 00:22:31,861
No subharmonic
transmissions detected.

410
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,268
Any unusual
neural wave patterns?

411
00:22:34,304 --> 00:22:35,567
Negative.

412
00:22:35,606 --> 00:22:38,099
Any telepathic activity
on board?

413
00:22:38,145 --> 00:22:39,477
Negative.

414
00:22:42,186 --> 00:22:46,753
Computer, display
all arriving vessels

415
00:22:46,795 --> 00:22:50,929
from Stardate 47550
through 47571.

416
00:22:56,014 --> 00:22:57,813
None from the Gamma Quadrant?

417
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:00,343
No ships arrived
from the Gamma Quadrant

418
00:23:00,423 --> 00:23:02,552
within time parameters
requested.

419
00:23:11,745 --> 00:23:16,483
Coffee, Jamaican blend,
double strong, double sweet.

420
00:23:24,104 --> 00:23:27,839
You're drinking too much
of this stuff, O'Brien.

421
00:23:27,877 --> 00:23:30,347
Anything to stay alert, O'Brien.

422
00:23:35,226 --> 00:23:41,637
Okay, computer, play back
station logs chronologically

423
00:23:41,672 --> 00:23:45,167
starting with stardate 47550.

424
00:23:45,212 --> 00:23:48,947
Identify which officers' logs
are to be included.

425
00:23:51,959 --> 00:23:53,519
All officers.

426
00:23:53,562 --> 00:23:55,759
Vocal or transcribed?

427
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,029
Vocal.

428
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:59,735
Station Log, Stardate 47552.9.

429
00:23:59,774 --> 00:24:02,746
Admiral Gupta has arrived
to personally assess

430
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,343
the Cardassian movements
along the border.

431
00:24:05,453 --> 00:24:08,448
Several Federation colonies
in the demilitarized zone

432
00:24:08,492 --> 00:24:10,018
have complained of...

433
00:24:10,062 --> 00:24:12,761
...discovered a new life-form
previously unreported.

434
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,363
We have tentatively classified
it as a protozoic species...

435
00:24:15,473 --> 00:24:17,966
...lost in a shuttlepod
somewhere in the vicinity

436
00:24:18,011 --> 00:24:19,377
of the third moon of Bajor VII.

437
00:24:19,481 --> 00:24:20,949
We have two runabouts to use...

438
00:24:20,984 --> 00:24:22,886
...a request
by the Chamber of Ministers

439
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,354
that I find
absolutely ridiculous.

440
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,585
They have actually requested

441
00:24:25,626 --> 00:24:27,289
that we begin to screen
all arriving...

442
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:29,129
...were completed at 1700 hours

443
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:31,764
and seemed to be functioning
with no further difficulties.

444
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:32,966
A level-1 diagnostic...

445
00:24:33,008 --> 00:24:35,137
...The Admiral seemed satisfied

446
00:24:35,179 --> 00:24:37,672
that the Cardassians
would not violate the treaty.

447
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,318
Access denied.

448
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,089
Denied?

449
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:47,700
Access denied to what?

450
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:54,148
Station Logs after Stardate
47569.4 are restricted.

451
00:24:54,184 --> 00:24:57,213
The day I got back.

452
00:24:57,256 --> 00:24:59,351
Describe the restrictions.

453
00:24:59,394 --> 00:25:02,491
Access restricted
to level-1 security clearance.

454
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:04,628
I am level-1.

455
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:07,370
Please enter
security verification.

456
00:25:13,455 --> 00:25:15,322
Access denied.

457
00:26:06,661 --> 00:26:10,328
Anything I can help you with,
Chief?

458
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:12,566
No, I'm just making sure
these upper pylons

459
00:26:12,606 --> 00:26:14,473
are in working condition
by morning.

460
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,412
You're an inspiration
to us all.

461
00:26:21,591 --> 00:26:25,793
There were several traps laid
into the computer subroutine.

462
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:27,598
No doubt to let someone know

463
00:26:27,636 --> 00:26:30,199
if I'd penetrated
their security lockout.

464
00:26:30,242 --> 00:26:32,007
I wasn't fooled for a minute

465
00:26:32,045 --> 00:26:35,415
and released the protected
files without any problem.

466
00:26:50,215 --> 00:26:51,980
What I found
in those hidden logs

467
00:26:52,018 --> 00:26:53,544
didn't answer all my questions

468
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:56,559
but it sure as hell confirmed
what I'd been afraid of.

469
00:26:56,594 --> 00:26:58,894
They were analyzing
and reanalyzing

470
00:26:58,932 --> 00:27:01,563
everything I had put
into my report

471
00:27:01,604 --> 00:27:03,233
about Paradan security.

472
00:27:03,275 --> 00:27:05,507
They'd even broken
into my personal logs

473
00:27:05,612 --> 00:27:08,243
to see what they could find
in there.

474
00:27:08,285 --> 00:27:11,918
I hoped they enjoyed reading
the sexy letters to my wife.

475
00:27:11,958 --> 00:27:13,928
There were several entries
by Sisko

476
00:27:13,962 --> 00:27:16,262
about secured messages
from the Parada system

477
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,398
but no indication
what those messages were about.

478
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,503
Maybe they were afraid
I'd get into their files

479
00:27:22,546 --> 00:27:24,539
even with a security lockout.

480
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:26,620
Smart people.

481
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:39,308
Chief.

482
00:27:39,347 --> 00:27:41,317
Odo, we've got a problem.

483
00:27:41,351 --> 00:27:43,321
I have to talk to you.

484
00:27:43,355 --> 00:27:46,054
Hmm, it's good to see you, too.

485
00:27:48,899 --> 00:27:51,267
Aside from Jake,
not one of them was...

486
00:27:51,304 --> 00:27:52,567
I don't know, real.

487
00:27:52,606 --> 00:27:56,101
I'm not sure who we can trust
in the station at this point.

488
00:27:56,146 --> 00:27:58,275
Do any of them know
you're suspicious?

489
00:27:58,318 --> 00:27:59,947
Probably.
I've asked a few questions

490
00:27:59,987 --> 00:28:02,982
been a few places
that might have tipped them off.

491
00:28:03,027 --> 00:28:05,224
They'll be keeping
close tabs on me.

492
00:28:05,265 --> 00:28:07,998
I'd call Starfleet,
but what do I tell them?

493
00:28:08,037 --> 00:28:09,700
My wife doesn't seem
like my wife?

494
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,733
Sisko's been making
security arrangements

495
00:28:11,778 --> 00:28:12,905
without consulting me?

496
00:28:12,947 --> 00:28:14,712
They might even call
Commander Sisko

497
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,150
and start asking
questions about you.

498
00:28:16,284 --> 00:28:17,547
Well, that's
what I was afraid of.

499
00:28:17,587 --> 00:28:18,782
And when are the Paradas due?

500
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:19,915
38 hours.

501
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:22,930
Hmm. I don't want them coming
anywhere near this place

502
00:28:22,964 --> 00:28:24,593
until we get this cleared up.

503
00:28:24,634 --> 00:28:26,034
Agreed.

504
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,470
Go on about your business.

505
00:28:27,506 --> 00:28:29,703
Don't do anything
to get their attention.

506
00:28:29,744 --> 00:28:32,375
In the meantime,
I'll do some investigating.

507
00:28:32,416 --> 00:28:34,386
If I can confirm your suspicions

508
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:37,620
we can go to Starfleet
and the Bajoran authorities

509
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,719
at the same time.

510
00:28:38,762 --> 00:28:40,664
I'm glad you're back, Odo.

511
00:28:40,699 --> 00:28:43,899
We'll get to the bottom of this.

512
00:28:46,978 --> 00:28:51,078
I felt better
than I had for a long time.

513
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,022
I finally had an ally.

514
00:28:53,057 --> 00:28:55,550
Now all I had to do was wait.

515
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,893
I like to think
I'm a man with many talents

516
00:28:59,937 --> 00:29:01,736
but waiting isn't one of them.

517
00:29:01,775 --> 00:29:03,472
I had to cover my bets...

518
00:29:03,512 --> 00:29:06,005
prepare myself for whatever
might happen next.

519
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:08,851
I still had a few tricks
up my sleeve.

520
00:29:31,301 --> 00:29:33,932
The odds are against you,
O'Brien.

521
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:35,201
Against me?

522
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:37,074
What are you talking about?

523
00:29:37,112 --> 00:29:38,741
You know what I'm talking about.

524
00:29:38,782 --> 00:29:39,909
You look tired.

525
00:29:39,951 --> 00:29:41,442
Have you been getting
enough sleep?

526
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,617
What are you talking
about, Quark?!

527
00:29:43,658 --> 00:29:47,189
Racquetball, the rematch
with Bashir next week.

528
00:29:47,232 --> 00:29:50,329
We never finished
the first one, remember?

529
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:53,003
My, we are jumpy, aren't we?

530
00:29:55,281 --> 00:29:56,544
Change the subject.

531
00:29:56,584 --> 00:29:59,522
Fine, we'll change the subject.

532
00:29:59,557 --> 00:30:01,254
So, uh...

533
00:30:01,327 --> 00:30:04,458
tell me about the Paradas.

534
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,265
They're going to be
here when... tomorrow?

535
00:30:06,303 --> 00:30:08,535
Why do you want to know
anything about the Paradas?

536
00:30:08,575 --> 00:30:11,775
It's always good business
to know about new customers

537
00:30:11,815 --> 00:30:13,648
before they walk in your door.

538
00:30:13,685 --> 00:30:17,124
Oh, and which Rule
of Acquisition is that?

539
00:30:19,764 --> 00:30:23,636
Oh, one of the high numbers,
194, I think.

540
00:30:23,672 --> 00:30:26,701
Well, you'll have to find
out about the Paradas

541
00:30:26,744 --> 00:30:28,407
from someone else.

542
00:30:28,448 --> 00:30:30,418
Odo to O'Brien.

543
00:30:30,452 --> 00:30:31,852
Go ahead.

544
00:30:31,888 --> 00:30:33,687
Can I see you in my office?

545
00:30:33,725 --> 00:30:35,057
On my way.

546
00:30:43,778 --> 00:30:45,748
I see what you mean.

547
00:30:45,782 --> 00:30:47,684
What did you find out?

548
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,314
Sit down.

549
00:30:49,357 --> 00:30:52,761
How much do you know
about the Paradan rebels?

550
00:30:52,796 --> 00:30:56,235
Oh, don't ask me to explain
the politics of the situation

551
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:59,572
but I know they've been
fighting the government forces

552
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:01,512
for 12 years. Why?

553
00:31:01,548 --> 00:31:04,748
I'm just trying to understand
the players involved here.

554
00:31:04,787 --> 00:31:08,055
Odo, Sisko's logs indicate
that secret messages

555
00:31:08,093 --> 00:31:10,894
have been coming
from the Parada system.

556
00:31:10,933 --> 00:31:14,064
Could those messages have been
from the rebels?

557
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:16,007
As a matter of fact, they were.

558
00:31:16,043 --> 00:31:18,343
That's already a breach
of the security agreement

559
00:31:18,448 --> 00:31:20,577
we signed
with the Paradan government.

560
00:31:20,619 --> 00:31:23,591
And it's a good enough reason
to cancel these peace talks.

561
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:26,222
That still might be premature.

562
00:31:26,263 --> 00:31:28,529
What are you talking about?

563
00:31:28,568 --> 00:31:31,061
We've got more than enough...

564
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,942
They got to you.

565
00:31:34,981 --> 00:31:36,210
Don't be ridiculous.

566
00:31:36,249 --> 00:31:38,151
I'm just trying...

567
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:40,123
No, they did, they got to you.

568
00:31:40,157 --> 00:31:41,786
All right, let's have
a little talk.

569
00:31:41,828 --> 00:31:43,126
Who the hell are you?

570
00:31:43,163 --> 00:31:44,962
We don't want to hurt you.

571
00:31:45,001 --> 00:31:47,437
Here, this will help you relax.

572
00:32:06,944 --> 00:32:09,609
Computer, lock onto my combadge.

573
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:13,385
Initiate emergency transport
to Runabout <i>Rio Grande.</i>

574
00:32:13,491 --> 00:32:15,552
Unable to complete request.

575
00:32:15,595 --> 00:32:19,330
Please contact Station Commander
for assistance.

576
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:40,670
Making it tough for me, huh?

577
00:32:40,712 --> 00:32:42,807
Fine.

578
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:47,018
You want force fields,
I'll give you force fields.

579
00:32:49,697 --> 00:32:50,824
There.

580
00:32:50,866 --> 00:32:53,166
Now you want to get me?

581
00:32:53,203 --> 00:32:55,766
You'll have to release them all.

582
00:33:00,284 --> 00:33:01,810
Ha. Thank you.

583
00:33:13,511 --> 00:33:15,140
Jake! You okay?

584
00:33:15,181 --> 00:33:16,274
Yeah.

585
00:33:16,316 --> 00:33:17,648
Good.

586
00:33:17,686 --> 00:33:18,984
Listen to me.

587
00:33:19,022 --> 00:33:21,755
Something isn't normal
around here.

588
00:33:21,794 --> 00:33:24,698
Your dad, the others...

589
00:33:24,733 --> 00:33:25,996
something's happened to them.

590
00:33:26,036 --> 00:33:29,372
You and I are the only ones
who can help.

591
00:33:29,409 --> 00:33:30,741
Jake Sisko to Security.

592
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:34,013
He's here.
Level H-2, Section Five.

593
00:33:34,052 --> 00:33:35,213
It will be okay.

594
00:33:35,254 --> 00:33:37,087
Just surrender to them,
and you'll be fine.

595
00:33:58,968 --> 00:34:01,769
I'll search all habitat range...

596
00:34:01,807 --> 00:34:02,968
You two...

597
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:04,171
Spread out.

598
00:34:04,212 --> 00:34:05,772
Check all quarters.

599
00:34:05,815 --> 00:34:07,808
Advise people to stay
where they are

600
00:34:07,853 --> 00:34:09,253
and not to let anyone in.

601
00:34:09,289 --> 00:34:10,279
Yes, sir.

602
00:35:42,436 --> 00:35:44,372
Shut down your engines.

603
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,908
Sorry, Commander.

604
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:47,377
I have no intention
of doing that.

605
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,039
You will not be
allowed to leave.

606
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:50,142
I repeat.

607
00:35:50,185 --> 00:35:51,380
Shut down your engines now.

608
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,946
If you check your systems

609
00:35:52,991 --> 00:35:56,395
you'll find that the mooring
clamps are already unlocked

610
00:35:56,464 --> 00:35:59,300
and your tractor beams
are off-line.

611
00:35:59,336 --> 00:36:01,704
O'Brien out.

612
00:36:03,645 --> 00:36:05,547
Shields up.

613
00:36:12,931 --> 00:36:15,562
Are the shields holding,
computer?

614
00:36:15,602 --> 00:36:17,970
Shields at 71 percent.

615
00:36:18,007 --> 00:36:20,740
Warning, shields at 49 percent.

616
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:24,379
Transfer emergency life support
power to shield generators.

617
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,287
Transfer complete.

618
00:36:26,324 --> 00:36:27,587
Shield status.

619
00:36:27,626 --> 00:36:29,619
Shields at 93 percent.

620
00:36:31,835 --> 00:36:35,775
Full impulse,
heading 41 mark 330.

621
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:38,280
Confirmed.

622
00:36:38,314 --> 00:36:42,755
Computer, open a subspace
channel to Starbase 401.

623
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:45,283
Priority one, Admiral Rollman.

624
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,591
Stand by.

625
00:36:46,631 --> 00:36:49,194
Admiral, Miles O'Brien

626
00:36:49,236 --> 00:36:51,263
Chief of Operations,
Deep Space 9.

627
00:36:51,307 --> 00:36:53,334
I know who you are.

628
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,143
Admiral, I must apprise you

629
00:36:55,181 --> 00:36:57,413
of an emergency situation
on the station.

630
00:36:57,452 --> 00:37:00,185
There's been some sort
of takeover, a conspiracy.

631
00:37:00,225 --> 00:37:03,686
I believe it has something to do
with the Paradan peace talks.

632
00:37:03,732 --> 00:37:06,100
Listen to me very carefully.

633
00:37:06,137 --> 00:37:08,734
Return to DS9 immediately.

634
00:37:08,776 --> 00:37:10,302
Admiral, you don't understand.

635
00:37:10,345 --> 00:37:13,784
I believe Commander Sisko
and all of the senior officers

636
00:37:13,819 --> 00:37:16,950
have fallen under
the influence of something...

637
00:37:16,992 --> 00:37:19,258
Turn the ship around
and go back.

638
00:37:19,296 --> 00:37:20,993
You will not be harmed.

639
00:37:24,908 --> 00:37:27,744
It seemed almost
unbelievable to me.

640
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,752
Had someone or something
started to infiltrate

641
00:37:30,786 --> 00:37:31,913
all of Starfleet?

642
00:37:31,955 --> 00:37:38,298
Computer, new heading.
180 mark 31, to the wormhole.

643
00:38:06,925 --> 00:38:10,524
Coffee, Jamaican blend,
double strong, double sweet.

644
00:38:12,904 --> 00:38:14,965
Time to Paradas system,
computer.

645
00:38:15,008 --> 00:38:17,478
One minute, 20 seconds.

646
00:38:17,546 --> 00:38:20,211
How much lead time
do we have on the <i>Mekong?</i>

647
00:38:20,251 --> 00:38:23,189
At current speeds,
seven minutes, four seconds.

648
00:38:23,224 --> 00:38:26,458
That will disappear in a hurry
once we drop out of warp.

649
00:38:26,497 --> 00:38:30,494
Ah, at least, I get to choose
where they catch up.

650
00:38:30,572 --> 00:38:34,171
Computer, identify the largest
planet in the Parada system.

651
00:38:34,213 --> 00:38:35,511
Parada IV.

652
00:38:35,582 --> 00:38:38,782
Adjust course
to approach Parada IV.

653
00:38:38,822 --> 00:38:39,881
Confirmed.

654
00:38:41,393 --> 00:38:43,522
How many moons
around Parada IV?

655
00:38:43,598 --> 00:38:45,465
Seven.

656
00:38:45,501 --> 00:38:48,268
Hmm, lucky seven.

657
00:38:48,307 --> 00:38:49,536
Display coordinates.

658
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:51,512
Approaching the Parada system.

659
00:38:51,547 --> 00:38:53,244
Drop to impulse.

660
00:39:03,471 --> 00:39:04,905
Status of <i>Mekong.</i>

661
00:39:04,941 --> 00:39:06,501
<i>Mekong</i> has dropped out of warp

662
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,978
and has adjusted course
to identical heading.

663
00:39:09,016 --> 00:39:10,610
Perfect.

664
00:39:10,652 --> 00:39:12,918
How much time
have they made up on us?

665
00:39:12,957 --> 00:39:14,654
At current speed, the <i>Mekong</i>

666
00:39:14,693 --> 00:39:17,494
is two minutes, one second
behind this vessel.

667
00:39:17,532 --> 00:39:22,167
Adjust speed to let them catch
up to us in 30 seconds.

668
00:39:22,208 --> 00:39:24,508
Dropping to point-four impulse.

669
00:39:26,016 --> 00:39:29,284
Come on, I'm waiting for you.

670
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:37,233
Warning.

671
00:39:37,272 --> 00:39:38,763
Entering polar-magnetic field.

672
00:39:38,808 --> 00:39:42,008
Sensors will be nonfunctional
for 27 seconds.

673
00:39:42,048 --> 00:39:45,214
Switch to manual navigation.

674
00:39:45,254 --> 00:39:46,745
Switching.

675
00:39:48,996 --> 00:39:52,766
Computer, full impulse.
Engage.

676
00:39:52,802 --> 00:39:55,467
Confirmed.
Manual navigation in effect.

677
00:40:00,518 --> 00:40:05,119
Shut down all engines,
all main power systems.

678
00:40:05,161 --> 00:40:07,097
Maintain silent running status.

679
00:40:07,132 --> 00:40:08,623
Confirmed.

680
00:40:08,734 --> 00:40:14,177
Yeah, where did I go?

681
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:17,116
Now you see me, now you don't.

682
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:19,019
What's it going to be, fellas?

683
00:40:19,056 --> 00:40:21,960
I can play hide-and-seek
with the best of them.

684
00:40:23,697 --> 00:40:26,669
Hmm, no time for games, huh?

685
00:40:26,737 --> 00:40:29,766
Computer, identify
<i>Mekong's</i> new heading.

686
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:32,246
41 mark 201.

687
00:40:32,282 --> 00:40:33,580
Probable destination?

688
00:40:33,617 --> 00:40:35,883
Parada II.

689
00:40:35,922 --> 00:40:38,222
Parada II...
what's on Parada II?

690
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,889
Specify parameters.

691
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:42,298
Computer, monitor
all transporter activity

692
00:40:42,335 --> 00:40:44,396
to and from the <i>Mekong.</i>

693
00:40:44,439 --> 00:40:46,568
The <i>Mekong</i> transporter
has been energized.

694
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,101
What?
They beamed to the surface?

695
00:40:48,147 --> 00:40:49,410
Confirmed.

696
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:50,576
How many people?

697
00:40:50,618 --> 00:40:51,677
Three people.

698
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,983
Anyone left on board?

699
00:40:53,023 --> 00:40:54,184
Negative.

700
00:40:54,226 --> 00:40:55,991
Put us on a course
for Parada II.

701
00:40:56,029 --> 00:40:57,726
Take us into synchronous orbit

702
00:40:57,765 --> 00:40:59,758
above their location
on the surface.

703
00:41:28,127 --> 00:41:29,994
Having a little
unscheduled negotiation

704
00:41:30,031 --> 00:41:31,226
with the rebels, are we?

705
00:41:31,266 --> 00:41:32,632
You don't understand.

706
00:41:32,669 --> 00:41:35,139
Put down your weapons,
and we'll explain.

707
00:41:35,174 --> 00:41:36,437
No.

708
00:41:36,476 --> 00:41:38,742
I've got a better idea.

709
00:41:38,814 --> 00:41:40,977
You put down yours first.

710
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:45,856
Do it!

711
00:41:51,607 --> 00:41:53,041
You, too!

712
00:41:56,049 --> 00:41:57,746
Everything you need
to understand

713
00:41:57,785 --> 00:41:59,083
is behind this door.

714
00:41:59,122 --> 00:42:02,424
Yeah, like a squadron of rebels
maybe, huh?

715
00:42:02,462 --> 00:42:03,555
No.

716
00:42:03,597 --> 00:42:04,530
If you just permit me.

717
00:42:04,663 --> 00:42:05,756
Just stay where you are.

718
00:42:05,799 --> 00:42:07,062
Listen to him.

719
00:42:07,102 --> 00:42:09,038
He's not your enemy.
We're not your enemy.

720
00:42:09,073 --> 00:42:11,043
No?

721
00:42:11,077 --> 00:42:13,343
Please, this will
explain everything.

722
00:42:13,381 --> 00:42:15,044
I don't want to hurt you.

723
00:42:17,723 --> 00:42:19,886
Doctor, we need you!

724
00:42:42,939 --> 00:42:44,704
He's perfect.

725
00:42:44,743 --> 00:42:47,111
He looks just like me.

726
00:42:47,149 --> 00:42:49,551
Apparently,
he thought he was you.

727
00:42:49,586 --> 00:42:50,918
No doubt they thought

728
00:42:50,955 --> 00:42:53,084
that would make him
more convincing.

729
00:42:53,127 --> 00:42:55,427
We believe there
was some triggering device

730
00:42:55,465 --> 00:42:56,763
programmed into him

731
00:42:56,801 --> 00:42:59,067
that would take over
during the peace talks.

732
00:42:59,106 --> 00:43:02,442
The government scientists
have learned how to do

733
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:04,210
remarkable things
with replicants.

734
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:06,219
What was he programmed to do?

735
00:43:06,253 --> 00:43:07,551
We're not entirely sure.

736
00:43:07,589 --> 00:43:10,254
Assassinate someone
at the peace talks, we think.

737
00:43:10,328 --> 00:43:12,093
Perhaps our entire delegation.

738
00:43:12,132 --> 00:43:13,259
They were tipped off

739
00:43:13,367 --> 00:43:15,234
by one of the informants
in their government.

740
00:43:15,271 --> 00:43:17,036
There was a rumor
that you'd been abducted

741
00:43:17,074 --> 00:43:19,544
and replaced by a replicant.

742
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,777
We've had people looking
for you ever since.

743
00:43:21,817 --> 00:43:24,219
There was no way
to prove he wasn't you.

744
00:43:24,256 --> 00:43:26,488
He passed a physical exam
with flying colors.

745
00:43:26,527 --> 00:43:28,827
And he sure knew his way
around the station.

746
00:43:28,865 --> 00:43:31,165
I had more wires
attached to my head

747
00:43:31,203 --> 00:43:33,002
than you could count.

748
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:34,302
Now I know why.

749
00:43:34,343 --> 00:43:37,008
We were trying to shut him out
of every sensitive security area

750
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:38,515
while they were searching
for you.

751
00:43:38,551 --> 00:43:39,678
He must have wondered

752
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,314
what the hell was going on
with all of us.

753
00:43:41,423 --> 00:43:43,052
By the time we'd learned
of your rescue

754
00:43:43,093 --> 00:43:45,529
he'd already gotten away from us
and was on his way here.

755
00:43:45,565 --> 00:43:48,332
I wonder why he was coming back.

756
00:43:48,437 --> 00:43:51,170
If it were me,
I'd be trying to warn somebody

757
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:53,738
there was something
wrong at the station.

758
00:43:53,781 --> 00:43:59,350
Maybe in a strange sort of way,
he was trying to be a hero.

759
00:44:03,434 --> 00:44:05,028
Keiko...

760
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:11,580
What about her?

761
00:44:12,886 --> 00:44:14,685
Tell her...

762
00:44:14,723 --> 00:44:16,659
I love...
