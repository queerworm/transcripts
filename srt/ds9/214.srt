1
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,720
Computer,
set heading 410 mark 32.

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,805
COMPUTER:
Course laid in.

3
00:00:12,805 --> 00:00:16,767
Maximum warp.
Engage.

4
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,769
Time to Parada system.

5
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,938
One hour, 14 minutes.

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,737
Open a new file, computer.

7
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:35,327
O'Brien, Personal Log,
Stardate 47581.2.

8
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:43,418
I've got to try to set
the record straight

9
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:45,504
about the last 52 hours.

10
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:49,008
I don't know
who's going to hear this.

11
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:54,304
I don't even know
if I'll be alive

12
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,390
by the time
this log is recovered.

13
00:00:57,892 --> 00:01:01,269
I figure
they'll be coming after me.

14
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:04,314
If I'm right
about this whole thing

15
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:08,109
they won't want me
to warn the Paradas.

16
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:11,697
Coffee, Jamaican blend--
double strong, double sweet.

17
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:17,786
I wish I could tell you
who<i> they</i> are

18
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:22,875
but that's a part of the puzzle
I haven't figured out yet.

19
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:25,878
A part of the puzzle, hell.

20
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:29,590
None of this whole damn thing
makes any sense.

21
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,973
I'm trying to remember

22
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:43,020
the first time I noticed
that things were wrong.

23
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,981
It seems to me it was...

24
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:48,191
Yeah...

25
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,902
<i>it had to be the first morning</i>

26
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:52,029
<i>after I got back</i>
<i>to the station.</i>

27
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:13,425
What are you two
doing up so early?

28
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:17,846
Um, I had a lot of work
to catch up on at school.

29
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,015
Thought I'd get an early start.

30
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:21,976
At 5:30 in the morning?

31
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:23,852
Coffee, Jamaican blend--
double strong

32
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,145
double sweet.

33
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,522
I have a dozen essays to read.

34
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,944
Did you have
sweet dreams, darling?

35
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:33,862
Go away!

36
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,739
Don't I get
my morning kiss?

37
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:38,450
No!

38
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,911
Well, what did I do
to deserve that?

39
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,704
It's just a phase, Miles.

40
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:43,998
She doesn't
mean it.

41
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:45,124
Huh?!

42
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:47,584
Don't let it bother you.

43
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:56,927
What time did you
get to bed last night?

44
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,637
I don't know-- late.

45
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,388
I didn't want
to wake you.

46
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,099
I was tired.

47
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,019
I guess that trip
really took it out of me.

48
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:07,104
What did they
have you doing?

49
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:08,647
The Paradas?

50
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:10,732
They put me
through basic training

51
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,359
on all the security measures

52
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,820
they want in place
for the peace talks.

53
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,864
Odo would have had a field day.

54
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,907
I wish he could
have been there.

55
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,826
I'd better get going.

56
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:24,038
I'll drop Molly at day care
on the way to Ops.

57
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:25,497
Uh, that's okay.

58
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:27,166
I'm taking her
with me. Molly?

59
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,709
What? To school?

60
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,669
When you've got
all that reading to do?

61
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,420
That doesn't make
a lot of sense.

62
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,548
There's something
I want to show her.

63
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,175
Uh, a Vulcan program

64
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:38,093
that teaches basic
problem-solving skills.

65
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:40,804
At 5:30 in the morning?

66
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:43,182
I want to do it
while her mind is fresh.

67
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:46,060
Oh, if you say so.

68
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,769
See you later.

69
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,378
What's this?

70
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,797
Just getting
a head start, Chief.

71
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,092
Head start? Everybody
seems to be getting

72
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,927
a head start
on me today.

73
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,762
Sir?

74
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:25,933
DeCurtis, I appreciate your
bushy-tailed enthusiasm

75
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,475
but I was waiting for Odo

76
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,603
to come back from
Bajor to do this.

77
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,147
We have to realign the
entire security net

78
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,398
for the peace talks.

79
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,858
The Constable might have

80
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,818
a few things to
say about it all.

81
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:40,114
Commander Sisko didn't feel
we should wait for Odo.

82
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:42,032
Sisko gave you permission

83
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,743
to start this without
asking me first?

84
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,327
I don't think so.

85
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,329
You might want to check
with him, sir.

86
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,915
I'm only following orders.

87
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:53,043
I'll check with
him, all right.

88
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,544
Mr. O'Brien?

89
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:57,547
Carry on!

90
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,411
Computer, how much longer
to Parada system?

91
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,288
53 minutes.

92
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:37,207
Direct sensors back
toward the wormhole.

93
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:40,752
Scan for other warp signatures
on this heading.

94
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,670
One warp signature found.

95
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,340
Display.

96
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,801
Can you identify?

97
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,971
Identification confirmed:
Starfleet Runabout<i> Mekong.</i>

98
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,847
Ah, I figured as much.

99
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:56,351
They'll wait for me
to drop out of warp and then...

100
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,812
Well, we'll have to cross
that bridge

101
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,939
when we come to it, won't we?

102
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,482
Please restate question.

103
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,402
Oh, disregard, computer.

104
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,156
Continue Personal Log.

105
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:15,036
Okay...

106
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:19,374
So, it was all a little curious

107
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:22,002
but who could have guessed
at that time?

108
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,421
O'BRIEN:
<i>I mean, the way</i>
<i>they were acting</i>

109
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,840
<i>they might have been trying</i>
<i>to pull off</i>

110
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,759
<i>one of those surprise parties</i>
<i>that I can't stand.</i>

111
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,262
<i>Only my birthday's</i>
<i>not until September</i>

112
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,139
<i>and, believe me,</i>
<i>as it turned out</i>

113
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,975
<i>I had nothing else</i>
<i>to celebrate.</i>

114
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,268
Ah, there he is now.

115
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,436
I've been waiting
for you, Chief.

116
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:40,645
What is it, Julian?

117
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,646
No more excuses this time.

118
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,064
Excuses?

119
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,232
I'd like you
in my office in an hour.

120
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,233
For what?

121
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,567
Your physical.

122
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,195
You can't put this off
any longer.

123
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,363
Look, this isn't a good day.

124
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:51,072
It's the perfect day.

125
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,074
Commander Sisko has arranged
to have you covered.

126
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,784
What are you doing,
going to the Commander

127
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:55,952
about my checkup?

128
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,412
Because this has been...

129
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:59,331
I know how you feel about...

130
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:00,623
Forget it.

131
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,292
I've got things to do.

132
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,378
I'm afraid
I'll have to insist.

133
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:07,130
If I have to order you
as your superior officer

134
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,465
I will.

135
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:11,176
SISKO:
Is there
a problem?

136
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,053
Mr. O'Brien says

137
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:16,056
he's unavailable
for a physical.

138
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,598
Make yourself available, Chief.

139
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,518
Commander...
Dr. Bashir's
annual report

140
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:21,395
on the senior staff is due

141
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:23,063
at Starfleet
next week.

142
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,606
We've all had to
go through this.

143
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,818
Fine. Fine. I'll be
there in an hour.

144
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:36,410
Commander, can I talk
to you for a minute?

145
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,332
Ensign DeCurtis
mentioned to me

146
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,459
that you were
a little upset.

147
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:45,919
Well, not upset, exactly.

148
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,921
No, no, no. You have
every right to be.

149
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,340
I'm sorry I assigned him
before advising you.

150
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,551
I guess I dropped
the ball on that one.

151
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:54,094
Well, I guess I just felt

152
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,554
a little left out
of the loop, you know?

153
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:57,222
Understood.

154
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,349
I've gone through your
reports on the Paradas.

155
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,518
They seem unusually
preoccupied with security.

156
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,520
Well, they may be
a little paranoid

157
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,355
but I suppose
we would be, too

158
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:08,191
if we'd been engaged
in a civil war for 12 years.

159
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,070
Anything else I should
know about them?

160
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,654
Any unusual protocols

161
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,323
we should observe
when they get here?

162
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,866
No, nothing too
out of the ordinary.

163
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,785
It's all pretty much
in my report.

164
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:22,663
Now, tell me something
that's not in the report.

165
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,624
Sir?

166
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,876
You know, the kinds of things
we don't include in reports

167
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,628
but might help me
in these talks.

168
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,381
Well, I'd have to give it
some thought.

169
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:34,092
Well, there was one thing
I noticed.

170
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:37,637
Well, I don't know if it means
anything or not

171
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,889
but the Paradas have an odor

172
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:43,477
from some kind of skin
excretions, I'd guess.

173
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:45,312
It changes with their moods.

174
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:48,315
When they're upset, it can get
pretty strong, actually.

175
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:51,568
Oh, well, I'll try
not to get them upset.

176
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,403
Good idea.

177
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:55,322
Their leaders have been
in regular contact with us.

178
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,365
I've assured them
we'll be following

179
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,451
all of their security
recommendations to the letter.

180
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:01,786
I'll see to that.

181
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,746
Well, I certainly want you
to check everything

182
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,624
before they get here,
but the up-front work

183
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:07,542
can be done
by the engineering crews.

184
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:08,793
I have bigger problems for you.

185
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,420
Bigger?

186
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,839
All three upper pylons
are down again.

187
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,466
Well, that's impossible.

188
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,926
I went over that repair work
when I got back.

189
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:20,138
The pressure locks seemed
to be at maximum efficiency.

190
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,640
You'd better check again.

191
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,016
We had to tow in
a Bolian freighter

192
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,683
to a lower dock this morning.

193
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:27,354
Well, it can't be anything
that serious.

194
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:30,148
I rebuilt
that entire subsystem myself.

195
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,025
I'll get on it right away.

196
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,444
<i>After</i> your physical.

197
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:35,987
Yes, sir.

198
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,781
By the way,
I noticed you and Keiko

199
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:42,202
out in front of the school
this morning, talking.

200
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,828
Is there anything wrong?

201
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:47,207
Oh, Jake is having some problems
with his grades.

202
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,083
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, sir.

203
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,877
Keiko's very fond of the boy.

204
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,754
I'm sure she'll work
that much harder to help him.

205
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,423
I'm sure she will.

206
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,770
Are you nearly finished?

207
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:13,525
I believe you've poked
into every orifice in my body

208
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:15,527
and created a few new ones.

209
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:18,154
Any dizziness?
Oversleeping?

210
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,407
Lack of energy?
Euphoria?

211
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,908
Yes! All of them!

212
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,951
Especially euphoria,
lots of euphoria!

213
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,537
Seriously.

214
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:27,706
Look, if you are
determined to keep me here

215
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:29,583
until you find
something wrong with me

216
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,585
I'll see if I can't grow you
a hangnail!

217
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,545
Eye problems?
Hearing? Headaches?

218
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:35,129
Headache-- there you go!

219
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,882
In fact, I'm getting
a very bad one right now.

220
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,842
Short temper.

221
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,970
Flies off the handle under
the slightest provocation--

222
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,598
perfectly normal
behavior.

223
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,600
Ah, I'm glad
you're enjoying this.

224
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,477
Sorry. I know how you
feel about doctors.

225
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,979
It's not doctors
I have a problem with.

226
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,898
BOTH:
It's you, Julian.

227
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,067
Well, your sense of humor
seems normal enough.

228
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,652
I don't have
a sense of humor.

229
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:58,653
Cough.

230
00:12:58,653 --> 00:12:59,696
(<i> coughs</i> )

231
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,030
How's the sex life?

232
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,949
I don't have
a sense of humor.

233
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:03,950
Cough!

234
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,452
(<i> coughs</i> )

235
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,328
Everything all right
in that department?

236
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:10,831
That department is none of
Starfleet's business, or yours.

237
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,667
Mother and father
in good health?

238
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,127
Oh, come on, Julian!

239
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,670
You knew my mother died
two years ago.

240
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,004
Did I?

241
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,715
You don't remember me
telling you

242
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,675
when my father
remarried last spring?

243
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:24,803
Me blathering on about this
woman I've never met before?

244
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,640
Of course.

245
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,683
Now I remember.

246
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:29,934
Are you finished?

247
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,352
Not quite.

248
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,771
I just have

249
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:34,981
one or two more
tests to run.

250
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,317
This is insane.

251
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:40,945
I haven't had a physical
take this long since I was born.

252
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,448
Look, unless I'm dying
or something

253
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,241
I think it's about time...

254
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,494
Wait.

255
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,162
That's it, isn't it?

256
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:52,873
I mean, there<i> is</i>
something wrong with me.

257
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,376
That's why everybody seems
so strange.

258
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:58,546
Relax, Chief.

259
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,675
I'm giving you
a clean bill of health.

260
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,217
You can get dressed.

261
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:18,857
JAKE:
Hey, Chief!

262
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:19,942
Hello, Jake.

263
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:20,985
I need a favor.

264
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,362
Sure, what is it?

265
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,697
I'm working on a
subspace transceiver

266
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:25,031
for my science project

267
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,658
but I can't seem
to figure out

268
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:28,284
how to get the emitter
crystal to work.

269
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,786
Subspace transceiver model--

270
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,163
I used to build them
when I was your age.

271
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:33,748
I'll be glad to help.

272
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:35,709
You don't think it's
a conflict of interest

273
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,752
or anything-- you being
married to the teacher?

274
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,462
Oh, we'll have to clear
it with Keiko

275
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:40,921
but I don't think
she'll mind.

276
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,423
Besides, it's a chance
to help get

277
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,842
those grades
of yours back up, right?

278
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:45,301
Oh, my grades are great.

279
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,969
I just want to keep
them that way.

280
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:59,566
O'BRIEN:
<i>Sisko was telling the truth</i>
<i>about one thing:</i>

281
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,442
<i>The upper pylons</i>
had<i> failed again.</i>

282
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,277
<i>It didn't make any sense</i>

283
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,780
<i>because the new pressure locks</i>
<i>I'd installed</i>

284
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,699
<i>seemed to be working just fine</i>

285
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:09,950
<i>so it had to be</i>
<i>an entirely new problem.</i>

286
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,871
<i>I realized it wasn't going</i>
<i>to be a quick matter</i>

287
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:14,706
<i>to track it down, after all.</i>

288
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:16,499
<i>And I couldn't help thinking</i>

289
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,793
<i>how this was going</i>
<i>to keep me occupied</i>

290
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:22,422
<i>while the security arrangements</i>
<i>for the Paradas were underway.</i>

291
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,764
How's it coming,
DeCurtis?

292
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,724
Chief, I thought
you had your hands full

293
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:34,183
with the upper pylons.

294
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,935
I do, but I thought
I'd take a break

295
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,812
check in on
your progress.

296
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:40,231
Everything's on schedule here.
We made a complete sweep

297
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:42,400
of all the quarters
assigned to the Paradas.

298
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,735
Good. Open it up.

299
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,111
I'd like to look
it over myself.

300
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,112
I can't, Chief...

301
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,781
That's an order!

302
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:50,324
Sir, the security
seal was activated

303
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,785
the minute we left.

304
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:55,121
Only Major Kira
has the access codes.

305
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,956
O'Brien to Kira.

306
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,958
KIRA:
Go ahead, Chief.

307
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,419
I'd like the access codes
to the Parada quarters.

308
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,838
SISKO:
Chief, what are you doing
down there?

309
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:07,007
Commander, I spent the
last week going over

310
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,469
these arrangements
with the Paradas.

311
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,471
I really need to be...

312
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,765
SISKO:
I want those upper pylons
operational, Chief.

313
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:15,391
<i>That's</i> your priority.

314
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,268
Understood?

315
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:19,395
Yes, sir.

316
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,342
JAKE:
Chief!

317
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,844
Is this
the right inverter

318
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,971
for the subspace
transceiver?

319
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:57,057
Where did you get this?

320
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,893
I haven't seen one of
these since I was a kid.

321
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:00,060
I replicated it.

322
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,395
I found the design

323
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,981
in a really,
really old data file

324
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:04,398
in the library program.

325
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,733
Really,<i> really</i> old?

326
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:06,860
Oh, I didn't mean that...

327
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,736
Don't worry about it.

328
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,613
Why don't you come by my
place tonight after dinner?

329
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,490
We'll see if we can add
the rest of the pieces.

330
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,367
Oh, that's great.

331
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,036
Jake, did anything unusual
happen here at the station

332
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,038
when I was in the
Gamma Quadrant last?

333
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,248
KIRA:
Jake, your father's
been looking for you.

334
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,917
I think he's back
in your quarters.

335
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:25,586
It may be important.

336
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,380
See you later.

337
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,799
Everything under control, Chief?

338
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:32,343
Under control, Major.

339
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,224
O'BRIEN:
<i>I worked on the pylon controls</i>

340
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,267
<i>the better part of the day.</i>

341
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:43,270
<i>"A needle in a haystack"</i>
<i>wouldn't do this job justice.</i>

342
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,566
<i>When I finally found the crack</i>
<i>in the RF power conduit.</i>

343
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,109
<i>I couldn't imagine</i>
<i>how it could have occurred</i>

344
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,945
<i>so deep in the system</i>

345
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:53,113
<i>unless someone had broken</i>
<i>it deliberately.</i>

346
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,332
Hard day?

347
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,001
Oh, yeah, you could say that.

348
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,253
You want to lie
down before dinner?

349
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,923
No, Jake's coming over
in a little while.

350
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:12,842
I promised to help him
with his science project.

351
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,886
Uh, Commander
Sisko just called.

352
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:16,554
Jake can't make it tonight.

353
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:17,972
He isn't feeling well.

354
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,265
Really?

355
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:20,934
He seemed okay
a few hours ago.

356
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:23,644
Well, you know
how it is with kids.

357
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,313
He probably just
ate too much junk

358
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:28,733
on the Promenade
after school.

359
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:30,026
Where's Molly?

360
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,945
She's over at
the Fredricksons

361
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:33,905
spending the night.

362
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,872
So, there's just
the two of us, then.

363
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:49,253
We'd better eat while
the food's still warm.

364
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:52,172
Well, the replicator
can keep it warm

365
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,634
and I can keep you warm.

366
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,893
What's the problem?

367
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,937
No problem.

368
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:08,982
Um, I'm just not in the mood.

369
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:11,109
I had a hard day, too.

370
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:17,782
Okay, we'll eat.

371
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,246
What is it?

372
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,915
Fricandeau stew.

373
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:28,208
But you don't like
fricandeau stew.

374
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,335
You do.

375
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,753
Yeah, but...

376
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:32,130
I just thought
you'd appreciate

377
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,132
one of your
favorite meals.

378
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:37,510
I know how you hate all that
terrible food when you're away.

379
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,847
A little endive salad

380
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:43,808
sweet flan
for dessert.

381
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,685
How thoughtful of you.

382
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,398
You're not having any?

383
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:55,028
I just feel like having salad.

384
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:56,487
You're not hungry?

385
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,489
I had a late lunch.

386
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:16,132
How is it?

387
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:32,815
You know,
I think I will lie down.

388
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,942
But you haven't eaten a bite.

389
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:39,238
Ah, I just don't seem
to have an appetite right now.

390
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:45,244
O'BRIEN:
<i>I don't know if there was</i>

391
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,580
<i>anything wrong with the stew</i>
<i>or not.</i>

392
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,373
<i>When I went back later to check</i>

393
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,834
<i>she'd already put it</i>
<i>into the disposal.</i>

394
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:54,587
<i>But all I could think of,</i>
<i>as I looked at her</i>

395
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:58,049
<i>was that this was not my Keiko.</i>

396
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:12,188
Computer...

397
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:19,112

398
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,948

...but all I could think of
as I looked at her

400
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,205
was that this was not my Keiko.

401
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:34,460
You're right.

402
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,171
She wasn't.

403
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:42,218
Continue log.

404
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:47,514
I didn't get much sleep
that night.

405
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:49,267
O'BRIEN:
<i>I waited for Keiko--</i>

406
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:51,477
<i>or whoever she was--</i>
<i>to go to bed</i>

407
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,187
<i>and I started my search.</i>

408
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:55,355
<i>I had no idea</i>
<i>what I was looking for--</i>

409
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:58,109
<i>something odd,</i>
<i>something not quite normal</i>

410
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:01,070

424
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,062
Negative.

425
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,439
Any telepathic activity
on board?

426
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,774
Negative.

427

429
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:57,126
None from the Gamma Quadrant?

430
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:59,670
No ships arrived
from the Gamma Quadrant

431
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,964

Coffee, Jamaican blend,

434
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:27,240
You're drinking too much
of this stuff, O'Brien.

435
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,616
Anything to stay alert, O'Brien.

436
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:41,045
Okay, computer, play back
station logs chronologically

437
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:44,340
starting with stardate 47550.

438
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,344
Identify which officers' logs
are to be included.

439
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:52,890
All officers.

440
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,892
Vocal or transcribed?

441
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:56,434
Vocal.

Station Log, Stardate 47552.9.

443
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:02,191
Admiral Gupta has arrived
to personally assess

444
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:04,735
the Cardassian movements
along the border.

445
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:07,613
Several Federation colonies
in the demilitarized zone

446
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,698
have complained of...

447
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:12,159
DAX:
...discovered a new life-form
previously unreported.

448
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,703
We have tentatively classified
it as a protozoic species...

449
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,331
SISKO:
...lost in a shuttlepod
somewhere in the vicinity

450
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:18,624
of the third moon of Bajor VII.

451
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,418
We have two runabouts to use...

452
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:22,128
KIRA:
...a request
by the Chamber of Ministers

453
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:23,503
that I find
absolutely ridiculous.

454
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:25,047
They have actually requested

455
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:26,673
that we begin to screen
all arriving...

456
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,717
DeCURTIS:
...were completed at 1700 hours

457
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:31,262
and seemed to be functioning
with no further difficulties.

458
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:32,721
A level-1 diagnostic...

459
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,640
SISKO:
...The Admiral seemed satisfied

460
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,101
that the Cardassians
would not violate the treaty.

Access denied to what?

465
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:53,409
Station Logs after Stardate
47569.4 are restricted.

Anything I can help
you with, Chief?

473
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,987
No, I'm just making sure
these upper pylons

474
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,739
are in working condition
by morning.

475
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:15,699
You're an inspiration

O'BRIEN:
<i>There were several traps laid</i>

477
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:27,002
<i>No doubt to let someone know</i>

00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,463
<i>if I'd penetrated</i>

479
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:31,589
<i>I wasn't fooled for a minute</i>

480
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:34,676
<i>and released the protected</i>

<i>What I found</i>

482
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:53,195
<i>didn't answer all my questions</i>

483
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:55,822
<i>but it sure as hell confirmed</i>
<i>what I'd been afraid of.</i>

484
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:58,242
<i>They were analyzing</i>
<i>and reanalyzing</i>

485
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:00,953
<i>everything I had put</i>
<i>into my report</i>

486
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,662
<i>about Paradan security.</i>

487
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:04,957
<i>They'd even broken</i>
<i>into my personal logs</i>

488
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:07,501
<i>to see what they could find</i>
<i>in there.</i>

489
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:11,380
<i>I hoped they enjoyed reading</i>
<i>the sexy letters to my wife.</i>

490
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,382
<i>There were several entries</i>
<i>by Sisko</i>

491
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:15,509
<i>about secured messages</i>
<i>from the Parada system</i>

492
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:18,720
<i>but no indication</i>
<i>what those messages were</i>
<i>about.</i>

493
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,890
<i>Maybe they were afraid</i>
<i>I'd get into their files</i>

494
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,017
<i>even with a security lockout.</i>

495
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,936
<i>Smart people.</i>

496
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:38,656
Chief.

497
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:40,658
Odo, we've got
a problem.

498
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:42,578
I have to talk to you.

499
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:44,288
Hmm, it's good
to see<i> you,</i> too.

500
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:50,544
Aside from Jake,
not one of them was...

501
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:51,795
I don't know, real.

502
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,589
I'm not sure
who we can trust

503
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:55,382
in the station
at this point.

504
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,510
Do any of them know
you're suspicious?

505
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,386
Probably.
I've asked a few questions

506
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:02,473
been a few places
that might have tipped them off.

507
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:04,517
They'll be keeping
close tabs on me.

508
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:07,478
I'd call Starfleet,
but what do I tell them?

509
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:09,104
My wife doesn't seem
like my wife?

510
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,231
Sisko's been making
security arrangements

511
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,650
without consulting me?

512
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,151
They might even call
Commander Sisko

513
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:15,861
and start asking
questions about you.

514
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,321
Well, that's
what I was afraid of.

515
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:18,322
And when are
the Paradas due?

516
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:19,697
38 hours.

517
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:21,741
Hmm. I don't want
them coming

518
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:24,578
anywhere near this place
until we get this cleared up.

519
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:25,912
Agreed.

520
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,623
Go on about
your business.

521
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:29,416
Don't do anything
to get their attention.

522
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:32,294
In the meantime, I'll
do some investigating.

523
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:34,213
If I can confirm
your suspicions

524
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:37,550
we can go to Starfleet
and the Bajoran authorities

525
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,676
at the same time.

526
00:28:38,676 --> 00:28:40,553
I'm glad you're back, Odo.

527
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:43,639
We'll get to the bottom of this.

528
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:50,937
O'BRIEN:

<i>than I had for a long time.</i>

529
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:52,856
<i>I finally had an ally.</i>

530
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:55,401
<i>Now all I had to do was wait.</i>

531
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,655
<i>I like to think</i>
<i>I'm a man with many talents</i>

532
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:01,574
<i>but waiting isn't one of them.</i>

533
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:03,492
<i>I had to cover my bets--</i>

534
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:05,785
<i>prepare myself for whatever</i>
<i>might happen next.</i>

535
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:08,664
<i>I still had a few tricks</i>
<i>up my sleeve.</i>

536
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:27,015
(<i> shouting and laughing</i> )

537
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:33,772
The odds are
against you, O'Brien.

538
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,190
Against me?

539
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,858
What are you talking about?

540
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,485
You know what
I'm talking about.

541
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,903
You look tired.

542
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,363
Have you been getting
enough sleep?

543
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:43,574
What are you talking
about, Quark?!

544
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:47,035
Racquetball, the rematch
with Bashir next week.

545
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:50,163
We never finished
the first one, remember?

546
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,708
My, we are jumpy,
aren't we?

547
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,462
Change the subject.

548
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:59,465
Fine, we'll change
the subject.

549
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:01,133
So, uh...

550
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:04,219
tell me about the Paradas.

551
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,179
They're going to be
here when-- tomorrow?

552
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,307
Why do you want to know
anything about the Paradas?

553
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:11,644
It's always good business
to know about new customers

554
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:13,520
before they walk in your door.

555
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,856
Oh, and which Rule
of Acquisition is that?

556
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:23,489
Oh, one of the high numbers,
194, I think.

557
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:26,659
Well, you'll have to find
out about the Paradas

558
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:28,118
from someone else.

559
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:30,245
ODO:
Odo to O'Brien.

560
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,664
Go ahead.

561
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:33,582
Can I see you in my office?

562
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:34,750
On my way.

563
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:45,636
I see what you mean.

564
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:47,554
What did you find out?

565
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,222
Sit down.

566
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:52,518
How much do you know
about the Paradan rebels?

567
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:55,854
Oh, don't ask me to explain
the politics of the situation

568
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:59,441
but I know they've been
fighting the government forces

569
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:01,318
for 12 years. Why?

570
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:04,571
I'm just trying to understand
the players involved here.

571
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:07,741
Odo, Sisko's logs indicate
that secret messages

572
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:10,619
have been coming
from the Parada system.

573
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:12,538
Could those
messages have been

574
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:13,955
from the rebels?

575
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,791
As a matter of fact,
they were.

576
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:18,168
That's already a breach
of the security agreement

577
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:20,420
we signed with
the Paradan government.

578
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,963
And it's a good enough reason

579
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,465
to cancel these
peace talks.

580
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:26,009
That still might be premature.

581
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,345
What are you talking about?

582
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:30,806
We've got more than enough...

583
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,685
They got to you.

584
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:35,935
Don't be ridiculous.

585
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,896
I'm just trying...

586
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,815
No, they did, they got to you.

587
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:41,692
All right, let's have
a little talk.

588
00:31:41,692 --> 00:31:42,984
Who the hell are you?

589
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,695
We don't want
to hurt you.

590
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:47,280
BASHIR:
Here, this will
help you relax.

591
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,825
(<i> groaning</i> )

592
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,802
Computer,
lock onto my combadge.

593
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:12,765
Initiate emergency transport
to Runabout<i> Rio Grande.</i>

594
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:14,767
Unable to complete request.

595
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:18,687
Please contact Station Commander
for assistance.

596
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,279
(<i> beeping</i> )

597
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,917
Making it tough for me, huh?

598
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:41,960
Fine.

599
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,256
You want force fields,
I'll give you force fields.

600
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:50,135
There.

601
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:52,512
Now you want to get me?

602
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,932
You'll have to release them all.

603
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:00,979
Ha. Thank you.

604
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:14,576
Jake! You okay?

605
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:15,702
Yeah.

606
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:16,912
Good.

607
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:18,371
Listen to me.

608
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:21,040
Something isn't normal
around here.

609
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,919
Your dad,
the others--

610
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,337
something's happened to them.

611
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:26,797
You and I

612
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:28,841
are the only ones
who can help.

613
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:29,967
Jake Sisko to Security.

614
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:31,343
He's here.

615
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,386
Level H-2,
Section Five.

616
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,972
It will be okay.

617
00:33:34,972 --> 00:33:36,348
Just surrender to them,
and you'll be fine.

618
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,998
SECURITY OFFICER:
I'll search all habitat range...

619
00:34:00,998 --> 00:34:02,248
You two...

620
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,583
ODO:
Spread out.

621
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,084
Check all quarters.

622
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:07,128
Advise people to stay
where they are

623
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:08,505
and not to let
anyone in.

624
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:09,631
Yes, sir.

625
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,976
SISKO:
Shut down your engines.

626
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:45,477
Sorry, Commander.

627
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,104
I have no intention
of doing that.

628
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:48,688
You will not be
allowed to leave.

629
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:49,940
I repeat.

630
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,190
Shut down your engines now.

631
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,110
If you check your systems

632
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,988
you'll find that the mooring
clamps are already unlocked

633
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:58,949
and your tractor beams
are off-line.

634
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:01,118
O'Brien out.

635
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,080
Shields up.

636
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:15,007
Are the shields holding,
computer?

637
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:17,634
COMPUTER:
Shields at 71 percent.

638
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:20,261
Warning, shields at 49 percent.

639
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:24,016
Transfer emergency life support
power to shield generators.

640
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:25,976
Transfer complete.

641
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:27,185
Shield status.

642
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,104
Shields at 93 percent.

643
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:35,318
Full impulse,
heading 41 mark 330.

644
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:37,988
Confirmed.

645
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:39,489
Computer

646
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:42,283
open a subspace channel
to Starbase 401.

647
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,953
Priority one, Admiral Rollman.

648
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:46,121
Stand by.

649
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:47,539
Admiral

650
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:48,957
Miles O'Brien

651
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,917
Chief of Operations,
Deep Space 9.

652
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:53,045
I know who you are.

653
00:36:53,045 --> 00:36:54,713
Admiral, I must apprise you

654
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,965
of an emergency situation
on the station.

655
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:59,759
There's been some sort
of takeover, a conspiracy.

656
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:03,262
I believe it has something to do
with the Paradan peace talks.

657
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:05,765
Listen to me very carefully.

658
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,267
Return to DS9 immediately.

659
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,269
Admiral, you don't understand.

660
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:13,272
I believe Commander Sisko
and all of the senior officers

661
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:16,484
have fallen under
the influence of something...

662
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,987
Turn the ship around
and go back.

663
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:20,530
You will not be harmed.

664
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:27,204
O'BRIEN:
<i>It seemed almost</i>
<i>unbelievable to me.</i>

665
00:37:27,204 --> 00:37:30,289
<i>Had someone or something</i>
<i>started to infiltrate</i>

666
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:31,499
<i>all of Starfleet?</i>

667
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:34,002
Computer, new heading.

668
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:37,881
180 mark 31,
to the wormhole.

669
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:09,579
Coffee, Jamaican blend,
double strong, double sweet.

670
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,084
Time to Paradas system,
computer.

671
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:16,628
COMPUTER:
One minute, 20 seconds.

672
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:19,214
How much lead time
do we have on the<i> Mekong?</i>

673
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:22,175
At current speeds,
seven minutes, four seconds.

674
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:25,470
That will disappear in a hurry
once we drop out of warp.

675
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:29,557
Ah, at least, I get to choose
where they catch up.

676
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:33,186
Computer, identify the largest
planet in the Parada system.

677
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:34,771
Parada IV.

678
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:37,899
Adjust course
to approach Parada IV.

679
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:38,984
Confirmed.

680
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,654
How many moons
around Parada IV?

681
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:44,530
Seven.

682
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:47,284
Hmm, lucky seven.

683
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:48,660
Display coordinates.

684
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,620
Approaching the Parada system.

685
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,247
Drop to impulse.

686
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,176
Status of<i> Mekong.</i>

687
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:05,844
<i>Mekong</i> has dropped out of warp

688
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:08,221
and has adjusted course
to identical heading.

689
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:09,722
Perfect.

690
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:12,142
How much time
have they made up on us?

691
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:13,935
At current speed, the<i> Mekong</i>

692
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:16,521
is two minutes, one second
behind this vessel.

693
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:21,234
Adjust speed to let them catch
up to us in 30 seconds.

694
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:23,528
Dropping to point-four impulse.

695
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:28,283
Come on, I'm waiting for you.

696
00:39:35,165 --> 00:39:36,457
Warning.

697
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,210
Entering polar-magnetic field.

698
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:41,213
Sensors will be nonfunctional
for 27 seconds.

699
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:44,216
Switch to manual navigation.

700
00:39:44,216 --> 00:39:45,800
Switching.

701
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:51,848
Computer, full impulse.
Engage.

702
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:54,433
Confirmed.
Manual navigation in effect.

703
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:04,277
Shut down all engines,
all main power systems.

704
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:06,238
Maintain silent running status.

705
00:40:06,238 --> 00:40:07,780
Confirmed.

706
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:13,203
Yeah, where did I go?

707
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:16,206
Now you see me, now you don't.

708
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:18,083
What's it going to be, fellas?

709
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:21,002
I can play hide-and-seek
with the best of them.

710
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:25,631
Hmm, no time for games, huh?

711
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:28,843
Computer, identify
<i>Mekong's</i> new heading.

712
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:31,263
41 mark 201.

713
00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:32,597
Probable destination?

714
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:34,849
Parada II.

715
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:37,269
Parada II...
what's on Parada II?

716
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:38,937
Specify parameters.

717
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:41,314
Computer, monitor
all transporter activity

718
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:43,316
to and from the<i> Mekong.</i>

719
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:45,526
The<i> Mekong</i> transporter
has been energized.

720
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,237
What? They beamed
to the surface?

721
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:48,405
Confirmed.

722
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:49,572
How many people?

723
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:50,782
Three people.

724
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:52,075
Anyone left on board?

725
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:53,576
Negative.

726
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:55,078
Put us on a course
for Parada II.

727
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:56,662
Take us into synchronous orbit

728
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:58,706
above their location
on the surface.

729
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:29,154
Having a little
unscheduled negotiation

730
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:30,280
with the rebels, are we?

731
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,906
You don't understand.

732
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:34,284
Put down your weapons,
and we'll explain.

733
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:35,410
No.

734
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,829
I've got a better idea.

735
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:39,998
You put down yours first.

736
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:44,836
Do it!

737
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:52,051
You, too!

738
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,806
Everything you need
to understand

739
00:41:56,806 --> 00:41:58,433
is behind this door.

740
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:01,394
Yeah, like a squadron of rebels
maybe, huh?

741
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:02,603
No.

742
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,230
If you just permit me.

743
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,398
Just stay where you are.

744
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:06,899
Listen to him.

745
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,609
He's not your enemy.
We're not your enemy.

746
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,528
No?

747
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,947
Please, this will
explain everything.

748
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,573
I don't want to hurt you.

749
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:15,658
(<i> groaning</i> )

750
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:19,454
SISKO:
Doctor, we need you!

751
00:42:42,394 --> 00:42:44,396
He's perfect.

752
00:42:44,396 --> 00:42:46,564
He looks just like me.

753
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,234
Apparently, he
thought he was you.

754
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:50,651
No doubt they thought

755
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,611
that would make
him more convincing.

756
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:55,073
We believe there
was some triggering device

757
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:56,657
programmed into him

758
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:58,493
that would take over
during the peace talks.

759
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:02,038
The government scientists
have learned how to do

760
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:03,748
remarkable things
with replicants.

761
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:05,624
What was he
programmed to do?

762
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:07,460
We're not entirely sure.

763
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,921
Assassinate someone
at the peace talks, we think.

764
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:11,672
Perhaps our entire delegation.

765
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,299
They were tipped off

766
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:14,967
by one of the informants
in their government.

767
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,594
There was a rumor
that you'd been abducted

768
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:19,097
and replaced
by a replicant.

769
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:21,307
We've had people looking
for you ever since.

770
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,726
There was no way
to prove he wasn't you.

771
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:26,062
He passed a physical exam
with flying colors.

772
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:28,356
And he sure knew his way
around the station.

773
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:30,733
I had more wires
attached to my head

774
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,277
than you could count.

775
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:33,611
Now I know why.

776
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,113
We were trying to shut him out

777
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:36,614
of every sensitive
security area

778
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:37,823
while they were searching
for you.

779
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:39,451
He must have wondered

780
00:43:39,451 --> 00:43:40,952
what the hell was going on
with all of us.

781
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:42,870
By the time we'd learned
of your rescue

782
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:45,206
he'd already gotten away from us
and was on his way here.

783
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:47,875
I wonder why he was coming back.

784
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,628
If it were me, I'd be
trying to warn somebody

785
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,381
there was something
wrong at the station.

786
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:55,341
SISKO:
Maybe in a strange
sort of way

787
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:58,844
he was trying to be a hero.

788
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:04,559
Keiko...

789
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:11,190
What about her?

790
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:14,402
Tell her...

791
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:16,279
I love...
