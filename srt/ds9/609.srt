1
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:06,882
No, no, it is not fair!

2
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:08,258
Am I the only one here?

3
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,135
Is that it?
Hm-hm-hm? Is that it?

4
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:13,180
Am I the only one who sees?
Hm, hm, hm, hm?

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,307
And what
is that incessant noise?!

6
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:17,309
Calm down.

7
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:19,687
Am I talking too fast, Doctor?
Having trouble keeping up,
hm, hm, hm?

8
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:21,814
I don't want
to see you get upset, Jack.

9
00:00:21,814 --> 00:00:23,482
Please don't leave
us here, Karen, please!

10
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:25,275
It's only for a few weeks,
Patrick.

11
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,361
You know why they brought
us here, don't you?

12
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,404
Why they carted us
halfway across the quadrant?

13
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,574
They're going
to experiment on us.

14
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,660
Stop it, Jack.
(<i> whimpers</i> )

15
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,871
They want to find out
what makes our genetically
engineered brains tick.

16
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:39,999
They're going
to cut our heads open
and see what comes out!

17
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:41,166
(<i> sobbing</i> )
(<i> laughing</i> )

18
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,459
He's just trying
to scare you.

19
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,419
KAREN:
Don't listen to him.

20
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,380
Now, I told you why
I brought you here, remember?

21
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,464
Mm-hmm.

22
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,466
To meet that doctor,
Dr. Bashir?

23
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:50,592
You know.

24
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,260
The handsome one.

25
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,721
KAREN:
He was genetically enhanced

26
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:56,264
when he was a boy,
just like all of you.

27
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,266
No, no! He's not like us.

28
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:00,060
I never saw him
at the Institute.

29
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,855
He wasn't locked away, hm-hm,
for being too smart, hm-hm?

30
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:04,565
He's passed
himself off as normal.

31
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,984
He's Mr. Normal Starfleet Man,
mm-hmm.

32
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:09,277
Mr. Productive Member
of Society.

33
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:12,155
Well, maybe we can learn
to be just like him.

34
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,325
Wear little uniforms, hm?
Yes, sir!

35
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,493
No, sir!

36
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:17,411
Thank you, sir!

37
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,704
I don't like
it here.

38
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:21,122
It's going to be
all right.

39
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:23,000
Dr. Bashir is going
to work with you

40
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,167
for a while,
that's all.

41
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,377
Just think of it

42
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,212
as a little vacation
from the Institute.

43
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,923
No, no, this is
<i>not</i> happening, no.

44
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:30,632
It<i> is</i> happening, Jack,
and you're going

45
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,467
to have to try
to make the best of it.

46
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:35,012
<i>I'm</i> going to make
the best of it.

47
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:37,096
See the way he's looking at me?

48
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:39,016
He's in love
with me already.

49
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:40,434
Give me that!

50
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,310
I want to go home.
(<i> door chimes</i> )

51
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,064
It's him.

52
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:49,109
See that?

53
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,402
That's what
I'm going to do

54
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:51,445
to your boyfriend.

55
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:52,487
(<i> chuckles</i> )

56
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,530
Give me the padd.

57
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,496
Sorry.

58
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,664
You're not sorry.

59
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,416
We both know that.

60
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,668
You did it on purpose
because you're upset

61
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:09,421
but there are better ways
of dealing with being upset.

62
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,841
I'll work on it.

63
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:18,263
All right, well...

64
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,140
I'll see you all
in a few weeks.

65
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,143
(<i> whimpering</i> )
Patrick, it's fine.
It's fine.

66
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,436
Go on.

67
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,317
Bye, Sarina.

68
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,074
You all right?

69
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,241
Oh, it's nothing.

70
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,451
Just another
run-in with Jack.

71
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,536
Like I said
in my report,

72
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,413
don't turn your
back on him.

73
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,665
Well, we better get you down
to the Infirmary.

74
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,416
I'm fine. You go on in.

75
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,167
They're about as
ready to meet you

76
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:50,004
as they'll ever be.

77
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:51,379
I just hope you
have better luck

78
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,298
getting through
to them than I've had.

79
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:58,799
Hello?

80
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,551
(<i> maniacal</i>
<i>chuckling</i> )

81
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,554
Funny. He
doesn't look
like a mutant.

82
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,806
Is that you, Jack?

83
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,141
He knows me.
He knows my name.

84
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:08,183
I didn't tell him my name.

85
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,684
It's all right.

86
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,561
I just read Dr. Loews' report,
that's all.

87
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,854
I knew that.

88
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,275
Hello, Sarina.

89
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:17,525
JACK:
What is he talking
to her for?

90
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,485
He read the reports.

91
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:19,903
She won't answer you.

92
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,780
Didn't you read the
reports? Hm-hm-hm?

93
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,659
Would anyone mind
if I turned on the lights?

94
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,869
Would anyone mind
if he turns on some lights?

95
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,454
Go ahead, we're not mole people,
you know.

96
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,538
Computer, lights.

97
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:33,708
Hello.
Lauren.

98
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:37,296
I know what you're thinking,
Julian, but I'm not
that kind of girl.

99
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:38,463
JACK:
Bashir, was it? Hm.

100
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,840
Rings a bell,
rings a bell.

101
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,258
Bashir, Bashir,
Bashir, Bashir, Bashir...

102
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:42,467
Ah, got it, got it!

103
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,303
15th-century poet--
Singh el Bashir.

104
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:45,262
Any relation?

105
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:46,387
Yes, actually.

106
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,555
His work
was totally derivative.

107
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:48,807
He was a plagiarist.

108
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:49,891
You knew that.
You had to know that.

109
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,143
Yet you come in here

110
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:52,227
bragging about it
anyway, hm, hm.

111
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,228
Why? Hm? Hm?

112
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:54,437
(<i> chuckling</i> )

113
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,689
You're the one
who brought it up.

114
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,024
Well, what was I
supposed to do--

115
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,984
just let you get away
with it?! Hm-hm-hm?

116
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:00,443
That noise!

117
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,696
Tell me, Doctor,
what kind of enhancements

118
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,572
did your parents
have done to you?

119
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,658
Mental abilities, mostly

120
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:08,743
but they had
my hand/eye
coordination

121
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,579
reflexes and vision
improved as well.

122
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,750
Can you do that? Hm-hm-hm?

123
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,793
I doubt it.

124
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,503
Yeah, what happened?

125
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:21,215
Uh, your parents couldn't afford
the full overhaul, hm-hm?

126
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:22,966
He turned out all right.

127
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,677
You're not exactly known for
being very discriminating, hm?

128
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,304
I turned you down, didn't I?

129
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,680
And you're still regretting it!

130
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,474
The cube root of 329--
what is it?

131
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,561
6.903.

132
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:35,854
LAUREN:
Very good!

133
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:38,190
And you didn't even use
your fingers.

134
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,109
He's a mutant,
just like the rest of us.

135
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,861
No, no, no, he is not like us.

136
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,029
He passed as normal.

137
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,364
Is that true?

138
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:46,781
Did you pass as normal?
Is that true?

139
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,950
My genetic status was
discovered a year ago.

140
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,409
LAUREN:
How'd you manage to hide it

141
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:51,870
for so long?

142
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:55,290
I did my best not
to exploit my abilities.

143
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,584
Mm-mmm,
so no one would suspect.

144
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,378
Very clever. I'm impressed.
(<i> chuckles</i> )

145
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:00,921
Now, that's not right!

146
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,715
There are reasons why DNA
resequencing is illegal.

147
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,759
There are reasons
why people like us

148
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,177
are barred from serving
in Starfleet.

149
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,678
We have an advantage.

150
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,930
Normal people can't compete.
It's not fair.

151
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,431
Maybe you're right.

152
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,515
Maybe I should have
said something sooner.

153
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,892
There are rules--

154
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,643
uh, uh, don't talk
with your mouth full,

155
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,771
don't open an airlock
when somebody's inside it,

156
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,856
and don't lie
about your genetic status.

157
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,524
No, no, no, you did.
You lied.

158
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,777
You'd lied, and-and then
when you got caught

159
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,904
you cut a deal with Starfleet,
hm, hm, hm, hm?

160
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,447
You-you got yourself
off the hook.

161
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,823
If you'd told the truth

162
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,658
you could have lived with us
at the Institute.

163
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:31,826
Hm, he's right, you know.

164
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,120
Then they would have
put you away.

165
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,537
They don't put
people away

166
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,997
for being
genetically
engineered.

167
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,874
No, no, no, no,
they just won't let you

168
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,459
do anything that's worth doing!

169
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,961
No, no, they are afraid
that people like us

170
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:41,920
are going to take over!

171
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,297
Well, it happened before.

172
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:44,756
People like us<i> did</i>
try and take over.

173
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,591
Oh, no, no, I knew you
were going to do that.

174
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,385
I knew that you were going
to trot out the Eugenics War.

175
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:49,844
I'm not trotting
out anything.

176
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,596
All I'm saying is
there's a good reason

177
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,307
why we've been barred
from certain professions

178
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:54,515
but that doesn't
mean we can't be

179
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:55,600
productive members
of society.

180
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,851
Yeah, here it comes--

181
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,937
the "We Can Still Contribute"
speech.

182
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,439
No, no, no, no.

183
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,357
I will not forget
what was done to me.

184
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,025
I will not be
a part of a society

185
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,986
that put me away
for being too smart! No, no!

186
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,528
All right, then.

187
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:10,449
Seeing as though you have
all the answers already,

188
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,033
I'll spare you the speech.

189
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,790
I'm having dinner
with some friends.

190
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,708
What? You think we
don't eat? We eat.

191
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,210
We're going to
eat right now.

192
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,295
Hm? Y-Yum-yum.

193
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,504
I'll go set the table.

194
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:30,927
Don't worry about us.

195
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,095
We'll be fine. Hm.

196
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,222
Thanks for
scaring him off.

197
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:42,105
BASHIR:
All I kept thinking was

198
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,358
"There, but for
the grace of God, go I."

199
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,818
DAX:
How do you mean?

200
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:49,112
My parents managed
to find a decent doctor

201
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:51,198
to perform the DNA
resequencing on me.

202
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,866
These four
weren't so lucky.

203
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,827
They all suffered
unintended side effects,

204
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,496
and by the time
they were five or six,

205
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:59,498
their parents were forced
to come forward

206
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:01,208
and admit they'd broken the law

207
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,293
so that their children
could get treatment.

208
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,670
Hm. Perhaps they waited
too long.

209
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,256
Yeah. There was nothing

210
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,884
the doctors at the Institute
could do for them.

211
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,553
These cases are so rare.
There's no standard treatment.

212
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,096
I can't imagine

213
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,015
it was a very stimulating
environment for them.

214
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,350
That's what Dr. Loews thought

215
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,227
when she first came
to the Institute.

216
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,729
She got permission to separate
them from the other residents

217
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,105
so that she could work
with them.

218
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,107
Why did she bring them here?

219
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,943
She thought they might respond

220
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:32,613
to meeting someone
like them who was leading
a normal life.

221
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,909
She was also hoping that one day

222
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:39,329
they might be able to live
on their own and be productive.

223
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,915
Well, let's hope they
don't become<i> too</i> productive.

224
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,583
Might make the rest of us
look bad.

225
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,253
It is not a
laughing matter.

226
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,963
If people like them are
allowed to compete freely,

227
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,424
then parents would
feel pressured

228
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:51,508
to have their
children enhanced

229
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,343
so they could keep up.

230
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:57,847
That's precisely what prompted
the ban on DNA resequencing

231
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,433
in the first place.

232
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,269
Giving them
a chance to contribute

233
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,479
doesn't necessarily
mean sanctioning

234
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,189
what was done to them.

235
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:09,109
They didn't ask
to have their DNA tampered with.

236
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,152
They were only children.

237
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,446
And why should they be excluded

238
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,489
just because their parents
broke the law?

239
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,116
You're right.

240
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,410
It's not quite fair...

241
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:23,582
but even so, it seemed like
a good way to discourage
genetic tampering.

242
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:25,292
O'BRIEN:
Besides,
it's not as if

243
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,210
we're trying to exclude them
from anything.

244
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,129
We're just... talking about...

245
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,339
you know, limiting
what they're allowed to do.

246
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,467
Like joining Starfleet.

247
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:34,426
Exactly.

248
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:35,469
BASHIR:
Are you saying

249
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:36,636
that I shouldn't be allowed

250
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,054
to wear this uniform?

251
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,265
Well, you are an exception.

252
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,350
Ah, an exception.

253
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,435
I should be used to that.

254
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,270
I've been one all my life--

255
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,481
first, because
of the DNA resequencing,

256
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:52,235
and now, because I've been
<i>allowed</i> to join Starfleet.

257
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:55,155
Perhaps I should not
have said anything.

258
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,906
No. No, it's all right.

259
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,120
SISKO:
Well

260
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,038
does anyone care to speculate

261
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:07,250
about what Gul Damar
is going to say in his speech?

262
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,419
Nothing we're going to like,
I'll bet.

263
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,212
It should be starting
any minute.

264
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,755
If he's going to announce

265
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,508
another new
battle offensive

266
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:17,260
it's going to
spoil dessert.

267
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,428
JACK:
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

268
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,096
<i>H-Hello, calling Dr. Bashir.</i>

269
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,389
(<i> sighing</i> ):
Jack...

270
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,974
<i>Hello. Anybody there? Hm-hm?</i>

271
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:25,185
Did you give them access
to the com system?

272
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:30,190
<i>Hello? Hello? Dr. Bashir? Hm?</i>
No, they must have
broken in somehow. Oh!

273
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:34,611
I'd love to stay and chat
about our impending doom, but...

274
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,119
JACK:
I can't take it!

275
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,205
Would you do something
about that noise!

276
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,206
What noise?

277
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,666
What kind of sick game

278
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,292
are you people
playing, hm?!

279
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,669
What are you talking about?

280
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:52,170
Can't you hear it?!

281
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,006
We complained, and two
very cute engineers came by

282
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,090
and said there
was nothing wrong.

283
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,300
Wait a minute.

284
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,801
Is it a kind
of high-pitched whine?

285
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,053
Yes! Thank God!

286
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,805
See? I told you
we weren't crazy.

287
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:03,931
Hm-hm-hm?

288
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,143
You<i> are</i> a mutant.

289
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,311
You are.

290
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,897
Now, do something
about that noise

291
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,399
or I will snap her neck.

292
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,867
I called Chief O'Brien.
Now, let her go.

293
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,911
Maybe I'll wait
until he gets here.

294
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,413
If you don't let her go

295
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,707
I'll tell the Chief
the noise went away

296
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:29,874
by itself.

297
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,918
You think I want
to be doing this?

298
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,878
I'm just making sure
things get done.

299
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,260
Unbelievable.

300
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,011
This is the
thanks I get.

301
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,804
Are you all right?

302
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:46,807
(<i> door chimes</i> )

303
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:47,808
(<i> sighs heavily</i> )

304
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,686
Come in.

305
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,646
Miles...

306
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,314
I wonder if you
could find out

307
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,691
what's making that noise.

308
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,068
I know you can't hear it,
but it's there--

309
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:58,945
probably a sympathetic
vibration

310
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,821
in the power coupling
or something.

311
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,574
What do you know?
You're right.

312
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:03,824
JACK:
Well, why
don't you fix it

313
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:04,909
dear fellow, dear fellow?

314
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,536
Well, why don't
you fix it

315
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,662
before I go mad?!

316
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:18,965
(<i> quietly</i> ):
He's married.

317
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,634
Too bad.

318
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:25,054
Sounds like the plasma
flow's out of sync.

319
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,725
You're right.

320
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,769
Better realign it.

321
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:31,728
I was just thinking that.

322
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,480
Yeah. Ooh!

323
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,691
It's about to start.

324
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:38,693
Almost finished.

325
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:41,655
There.

326
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:42,614
JACK:
Finally.

327
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:43,990
LAUREN/PATRICK:
Ah!

328
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,409
Much better.
Thank you, Chief.

329
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:47,952
DAMAR:
<i>Fellow citizens</i>

330
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,580
<i>these are great days</i>
<i>for Cardassia.</i>

331
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,999
<i>Together,</i>
<i>with our Dominion allies,</i>

332
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:57,086
<i>we have given our enemies</i>
<i>cause to fear us once more.</i>

333
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,546
Can't argue
with that.

334
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,547
Who's he?

335
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,715
It's Damar,
the new head

336
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,133
of the Cardassian
government.

337
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:05,011
"Uneasy lies the head
that wears the crown."

338
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,137
He's sad.

339
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:07,388
Ashamed
is more like it.

340
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,515
Why do you
say that?

341
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:09,516
Shh!

342
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:10,975
<i>...we are poised to make</i>

343
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,978
<i>another bold step</i>
<i>to ensure our future.</i>

344
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,355
<i>Peace!</i>

345
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,981
Looks like a man
who doesn't sleep.

346
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,609
"Methought I heard a voice cry,
'sleep no more!

347
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,402
'Damar does murder sleep.'"

348
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,903
He's killed someone!

349
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,656
Someone close to him.

350
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:26,157
How could they know that?

351
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:27,617
<i>...shed their blood</i>
<i>to defend their home.</i>

352
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:31,120
<i>Their sacrifice must not be</i>
<i>in vain.</i>

353
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,706
<i>The peace we seek</i>

354
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:35,625
<i>will honor their memory</i>
<i>and preserve the gains</i>

355
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,627
<i>for which they gave</i>
<i>their lives.</i>

356
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:42,507
<i>I challenge the Federation</i>
<i>to answer my call for peace.</i>

357
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:46,594
<i>I am ready</i>
<i>at any time to meet</i>
<i>with its representatives</i>

358
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,556
<i>to discuss how we can put</i>
<i>an end to hostilities.</i>

359
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,391
<i>As your leader...</i>

360
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,476
Pretender! You don't belong
on that throne, and you know it.

361
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,478
<i>...everything in my power</i>
<i>to protect Cardassia.</i>

362
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,772
Someone's making him say
all this. He doesn't want to.

363
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:59,315
<i>...forward into a new era.</i>

364
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:03,486
<i>This I vow</i>
<i>with my life's blood...</i>

365
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:05,905
<i>for my sons...</i>

366
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,783
<i>for all our sons.</i>

367
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:13,079
Did any of you know who
Damar was before today?

368
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,164
JACK:
No, no, no,
but it's obvious who he is.

369
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,750
The pretender...
(<i> chuckles</i> )

370
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,668
...who-who killed the king
and seized the throne.

371
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,587
Not the king.
He's still alive.

372
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,213
Oh, the queen, maybe...
(<i> gasps</i> )

373
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:23,590
Or a princess.
Mmm.

374
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,965
Yes. Ziyal.

375
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,551
That's Gul Dukat's
daughter.

376
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:27,927
JACK:
And now, the pretender

377
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,554
finds himself
in league with

378
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:32,181
a-a-a dark knight that
he can't control. Hm, hm?

379
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,182
Weyoun?

380
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,517
JACK:
It's not a bad story.

381
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,185
Epic, really.

382
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,898
What else can you
tell us? Hm, hm?

383
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:42,859
It was amazing.

384
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,985
They pieced together
the entire story

385
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,446
of how Damar
came to power.

386
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,739
Weyoun is the dark prince,

387
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:49,449
Gul Dukat is
the deposed king,

388
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,450
Damar is the pretender

389
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,659
to the throne, and Ziyal is

390
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,536
the innocent princess
he murdered.

391
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:56,247
And now the pretender is wracked
with guilt over what he's done.

392
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:59,083
And they got all this just
from watching Damar's speech?

393
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,460
Oh, they were fascinated
by the whole thing.

394
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,795
They kept bombarding me

395
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,713
with questions
about Cardassia and the war.

396
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:05,298
I've never seen them so engaged.

397
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,883
And you want
to keep them engaged.

398
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,384
I'd like to try.

399
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,761
I'm just running
out of material.

400
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:10,845
What do you mean?

401
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,221
Well, they've already gone

402
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,431
through everything
the computer has

403
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:14,515
on Cardassia and the Dominion.

404
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,352
Roll out the red carpet.

405
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,437
Visitors?

406
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:21,481
Starfleet has decided
to listen

407
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,190
to what Damar has to say.

408
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,152
He and Weyoun will be arriving
in the morning

409
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,655
and I am the lucky one
who gets the chance

410
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,448
to sit across the table
from them.

411
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:31,658
That's great!

412
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,326
KIRA:
It's hard
to believe

413
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,869
that the Dominion
really wants peace.

414
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,454
I wouldn't be
surprised if
they were

415
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,456
just stalling for time
in order to regroup.

416
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:40,541
Sir, is there any chance
I can get a transcript

417
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,542
of the negotiations?

418
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,128
You can do better than that.

419
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,923
The Dominion has insisted
on recording the proceedings

420
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,341
so that everyone can see

421
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,718
that their desire for peace
is sincere.

422
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,261
Perfect.

423
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,514
You shouldn't have agreed
to that, Benjamin.

424
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,850
Now you have to be
on your best behavior.

425
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,185
Hm.

426
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,728
So, the pretender
and his dark knight

427
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,229
are coming to the station,
hm, hm?

428
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,523
And the story's
not over, eh?

429
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,900
Peace talks
could be interesting.

430
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,109
I'd say so

431
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,361
and the best part is

432
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,237
we're going to have
ringside seats.

433
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,198
(<i> whining</i> )

434
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,783
(<i> Patrick laughing</i> )

435
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,702
Mmm-mmm!

436
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,129
Ah, Major!

437
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,798
Welcome to
Deep Space 9.

438
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,675
How nice
to see you again.

439
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:33,219
Can I give you a word
of advice, Weyoun?

440
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,470
By all means.

441
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,138
You're welcome
to play your little

442
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,098
"we're all friends
here" game with me,

443
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,267
but I wouldn't try it
with Captain Sisko.

444
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,561
He's not in the mood.

445
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:42,645
DAMAR:
We're on a mission

446
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:43,855
of peace, Major.

447
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:45,314
Maybe he should
<i>get</i> in the mood.

448
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,615
This is the border
as it existed

449
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,743
before hostilities
broke out.

450
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:59,245
This is the border
we are now proposing.

451
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:02,415
This arrangement would award
disputed star systems

452
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:06,252
to the side that already has
effective control over them.

453
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,671
On the balance, we are
giving up more than you.

454
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:11,131
JACK:
Computer, freeze program.

455
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,132
Computer...

456
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:13,133
Hi. Uh, listen.

457
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,011
Go to native language mode

458
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:17,638
and replay time code
7-6-1 through, uh, uh...

459

JACK:
Got you!

462
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,230
Did you hear that,
hm, hm, hm?

463
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,233
He used the passive
voice transitive, hm, hm.

464
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,902
Since when could you
speak Dominionese?

465
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:32,236
Hm, since this morning.

466
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:35,073
That phrasing is only used
to make a request,

467
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:36,240
not a statement.

468
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,951
They are up to something,
hm, hm, hm.

469
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,994
(<i> Patrick laughing</i> )

470
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:41,913
What is it, Patrick?

471
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:42,956
Did you see something?

472
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:44,415
(<i> dismissive grunt</i> )

473
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:45,458
You can tell us.

474
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,753
They want the Kabrel system.

475
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:49,963
How do you know?

476
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:53,215
They kept avoiding it
with their eyes.

477
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,216
Are you sure?

478
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,302
They kept avoiding it.

479
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,429
Told you they were
up to something, hm, hm?

480
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:00,807
End program.

481
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:03,101
BASHIR:
All right,
they want

482
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:04,602
the Kabrel system, but why?

483
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:06,312
LAUREN:
I don't know,
but they're willing

484
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,688
to give up a lot to get it.

485
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,941
The mizainite deposits
on Holna IV alone

486
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:13,027
are enough to keep their
shipyards running for years.

487
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:15,029
Yes, yes, yes, that's typical
Dominion strategy.

488
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,697
They offer to give up
something valuable

489
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,658
in order to hide the fact
that they want something

490
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,200
even<i> more</i> valuable
in the long term, hm, hm, hm.

491
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,202
See, that's
how they think.
Big picture.

492
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,830
They don't worry about what's
going to happen tomorrow.

493
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,790
No, no, no.
They're thinking long term.

494
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,001
They're thinking what's going
to happen a year from now,

495
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:30,044
a-a-a decade, a century,
hm, hm, hm, hm, yes, yes.

496
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,797
There must be something special
about the Kabrel system.

497
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:35,133
LAUREN:
Nothing on the first planet
but some simple

498
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:36,884
protozoids
and tri-nucleic fungi.

499
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,386
The second planet
has some cormaline deposits

500
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,014
but they're
common enough.

501
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:43,141
Okay, okay, okay, maybe
there's another reason, hm.

502
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:45,101
Does it have
any strategic value, hm, hm?

503
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:46,060
(<i> padd beeping</i> )

504
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,520
LAUREN:
Not that I can see.

505
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,688
They wouldn't want
to build a base there.

506
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,148
JACK:
Why not, why not?
Hm, hm?

507
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:51,607
Seems perfectly suitable.
Hm, hm?

508
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,526
LAUREN:
It's not an optimum situation.

509
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:54,986
It's a binary system.

510
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:57,905
There's a lot
of ionic interference there.

511
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,490
JACK:
All right, all right,
forget it.

512
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,825
Does this have anything to do

513
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,326
with what we're talking about,
Sarina?

514
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:09,167
Can we take it?

515
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,088
JACK:
...like an ancient technology,
hm, hm, hm?

516
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:16,298
There's no evidence
of anything like that.

517
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,509
Any idea what this might mean?

518
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:23,263
SISKO:
Chemistry was never
my strong suit.

519
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,264
What is it?

520
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,725
BASHIR:
It shows

521
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,101
how you can break down
tri-nucleic fungus

522
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:28,602
to make
yridium bicantizine,

523
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,604
one of the active ingredients
in ketracel-white.

524
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,648
That's why the Dominion wants
the Kabrel system

525
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,067
so that they can manufacture
the drug

526
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,776
right here
in the Alpha Quadrant.

527
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,361
According to our calculations,

528
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,905
they'll be able
to manufacture enough

529
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:40,656
to supply the Jem'Hadar
indefinitely.

530
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:43,283
I was going to recommend

531
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:46,120
that the Federation accept
the proposed border.

532
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,664
It could've cost us
the Alpha Quadrant.

533
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,167
Actually, sir,
we should give them Kabrel.

534
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,210
Why is that?

535
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,544
If we don't,

536
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:55,046
the Dominion
will be forced to attack

537
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:56,881
before their stockpile of white
runs out.

538
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:58,298
Here are
the casualty projections.

539
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,676
As you can see,
an attack would result

540
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:03,554
in devastating casualties
for both sides.

541
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:06,015
Y-You're suggesting we stall?

542
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,684
It will buy us time
to rebuild our defenses

543
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:11,229
and bring the Romulans
into the alliance.

544
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:13,231
The Romulans.

545
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:14,774
According
to our analyses--

546
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,652
there it is--

547
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,279
they'll vote to abandon
their nonaggression pact

548
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,240
with the Dominion
at next year's plenary session.

549
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,033
By which time,
internal pressures

550
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:26,827
between the Cardassians and
the Dominion will have erupted

551
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,204
and after three years

552
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:31,082
six months and 27 days,
we predict that, uh--

553
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:32,250
Hang on a minute, Doctor.

554
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,751
How'd you come up with all this?

555
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,169
Two days ago,
you said these people

556
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:36,420
were impossible to deal with.

557
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,005
Now they're
turning out projections

558
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,258
that it would take
Starfleet Intelligence months

559
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:41,592
to come up with.

560
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:42,676
We're mutants.

561
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,220
I know.

562
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,346
We're not exactly qualified
for this kind of work

563
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:49,850
and it could be said that, uh...
it is beyond the limits

564
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:53,729
of what people like us
should be allowed to do.

565
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,564
But I think if you allow me

566
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,733
to walk you
through our analyses,

567
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,944
you'll be impressed.

568
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,825
All right, Doctor, go ahead.

569
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,743
Thank you, sir.

570
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,036
The way

571
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,788
our statistical
analysis works,

572
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:12,748
the further
into the future you go,

573
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,583
the more accurate
the projection.

574
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,794
It's based on a kind
of nonlinear dynamics

575
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:19,255
whereby small fluctuations
tend to factor out over time.

576
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:22,008
The net result is--
Just a minute, Doctor.

577
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:24,218
Why don't we go back
to the beginning

578
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:27,305
and take me through this
step-by-step...

579
00:22:27,305 --> 00:22:28,931
nice and easy.

580
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:31,892
Gladly, sir.

581
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:37,523
Captain Sisko said he
would take our analyses

582
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,566
to Starfleet Command
right away.

583
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:42,111
Imagine that--
Starfleet Command. Hm.

584
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:43,696
All those admirals.

585
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,198
It's a party!

586
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:46,782
BASHIR:
It is now.

587
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,034
We need music.

588
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:49,285
Computer, music.

589
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:50,619
Make it grand.

590
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:51,912

What a pleasant

I, uh...

I need to replace
that power coupling.

Don't mind us.

No, thanks.

He doesn't like me.

I do not.

Go play with your friend.

The last thing

I wanted to do
was upset them.

Oh, it's all right.

The only reason
Patrick gets so emotional...

650

is because he likes you.

might do all right

705
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,616
(<i> sighs</i> )

706
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:39,866
I've got good news.

707
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,201
Starfleet Command
was so impressed

708
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,828
with our analysis
they've agreed

709
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:44,662
to let us have access
to classified information

710
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:46,499
regarding Starfleet's
battle readiness.

711
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,084
Is something wrong?

712
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,211
We have new
long-term projections.

713
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,130
You-you better
take a look.

714
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,048
You're not going
to like it.

715
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,310
Well? Hm, hm?

716
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,936
(<i> sighs</i> ):
Everything checks out.

717
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,229
I was hoping

718
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:10,356
you were going
to find a flaw.

719
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:11,731
Nope.

720
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,233
So then you agree
with our conclusion, hm, hm?

721
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,360
It's inescapable.

722
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,777
There's no way the Federation

723
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,695
is going to be able
to beat the Dominion.

724
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:19,573
We have no choice.

725
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:21,659
We're going to have
to surrender.

726
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,249
Surrender to the Dominion--

727
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,001
not on<i> my</i> watch.

728
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:32,919
Sir, I understand
how you feel.

729
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:35,297
I don't like it any
more than you do

730
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:37,841
but it's the best option.

731
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,177
We've run dozens
of different scenarios.

732
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:41,928
Even if something
unlikely were to happen

733
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,347
tilting the scales
in our favor--

734
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:45,683
such as an anti-Dominion
coup on Cardassia--

735
00:28:45,683 --> 00:28:47,267
we'll still lose this war.

736
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:50,770
But that doesn't mean
we just give up and roll over.

737
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,273
But if we fight

738
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:56,527
there will be over
900 billion casualties.

739
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:59,405
If we surrender,
no one dies.

740
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:01,281
Either way,
we're in for five generations

741
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,449
of Dominion rule.

742
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,493
Eventually a
rebellion will form

743
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,036
centering on Earth.

744
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:08,788
It'll spread...
and within another generation,

745
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:11,166
they'll succeed
in conquering the Dominion.

746
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,920
The Alpha Quadrant will unite
and a new, stronger Federation

747
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,964
will rule
for thousands of years.

748
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:20,718
But since we can't win<i> this war,</i>

749
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:23,679
why don't we save
as many lives as we can?

750
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:28,225
I know it's difficult to accept.

751
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,354
I don't accept it.

752
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:33,813
Your entire argument

753
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,148
is based on a series

754
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,192
of statistical probabilities
and assumptions.

755
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,944
They're not
just assumptions.

756
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,571
If you want me to take you
through the equations,

757
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:42,072
I will.

758
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:44,533
Even if I knew
with a hundred percent certainty

759
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:45,992
what was going to happen,

760
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:48,412
I wouldn't ask an entire
generation of people

761
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:50,456
to voluntarily give up
their freedom.

762
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:52,958
Not even to save
over 900 billion lives?

763
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,043
Surrender is not an option!

764
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:58,171
Now I'm happy to hear
your group's advice
on how to<i> win</i> this war,

765
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:00,966
but I don't need your advice
on how to<i> lose</i> it.

766
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,842
We can't win this war.

767
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:04,886
I don't care if the odds
are against us.

768
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,764
If we're going to lose,

769
00:30:06,764 --> 00:30:08,432
then we're going
to go down fighting

770
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:09,767
so that when our descendants

771
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:11,310
someday rise up
against the Dominion,

772
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,853
they'll know
what they're made of.

773
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:16,982
With all due respect, sir,
aren't you letting your pride
get in your way?

774
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:19,901
All right, Doctor...
you've made your recommendation.

775
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,987
I'll pass it on
to Starfleet Command.

776
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,531
Without adding your voice to it,
they'll dismiss it out of hand.

777
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,575
I'm counting on it.

778
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,496
So we go down fighting.

779
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:32,581
How terribly
courageous of us.

780
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,960
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

781
00:30:56,689 --> 00:30:57,981
What do you think?

782
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,193
It's pretty grim.

783
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,195
It's not just grim...

784
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,363
it's hopeless.

785
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:06,532
We can't beat them, Miles.

786
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:08,992
Well, it doesn't look
like it, does it?

787
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:13,539
We have to avoid a
long, drawn-out war.

788
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:15,374
You mean surrender?

789
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:16,875
I know...

790
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,252
it's an ugly word

791
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:21,087
but the facts are facts.

792
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:23,882
I don't know, Julian.

793
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,510
Don't tell me you agree
with the Captain.

794
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,094
I suppose I do.

795
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:30,389
Well... is there some
part of the analysis

796
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:31,973
y-you didn't understand?

797
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:34,893
Because if there is,
I-I-I'd be happy to explain.

798
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,062
I understood it perfectly.

799
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:38,480
Believe it or not.

800
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,106
That's not what I meant.

801
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,941
All I'm saying is

802
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:44,236
that you have to look
at the bigger picture.

803
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:49,157
Well, I'm trying, but
maybe I'm too<i> uncomplicated</i> 
to see it properly.

804
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,992
I didn't say that.

805
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,703
You don't have to.

806
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:54,454
The way you're acting...

807
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,498
you think nobody
with half a brain

808
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:58,208
could possibly
disagree with you.

809
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,502
Frankly, I don't
see how they can.

810
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:03,714
Well, I can see two possible
explanations for it.

811
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:06,007
Either I'm even more
feebleminded

812
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,301
than you ever realized,

813
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:10,888
or you're not as smart
as you think you are.

814
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,229
(<i> sighs</i> )

815
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:25,318
FEMALE:
Good, good, stop.

816
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,361
MALE:
One more!

817
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,071
ALL:
Dabo!

818
00:32:29,907 --> 00:32:31,199
Looks like
your lucky day.

819
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,200
Please.

820
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,452
You and I both know

821
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:35,370
these games of chance
are no such thing--

822
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,372
the odds are
in the house's favor.

823
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,791
Shh. Don't say that.

824
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:40,292
People are trying
to have fun.

825
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:43,378
Sooner or later, no matter
how perfectly I play,

826
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,756
no matter how well
I hedge my bets,

827
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:46,840
I'm going to lose.

828
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,925
Why are you
trying to spoil

829
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:50,051
everyone's good time?

830
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,177
Look around.

831
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:53,680
These people are
enjoying themselves.

832
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,767
Half of them know the
odds are against them
but they don't care.

833
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:58,268
They're here because
they want to believe
they can win.

834
00:32:58,268 --> 00:32:59,227
Is that so bad?

835
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:01,354
They're fools.

836
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:02,981
Why don't you just
take your winnings

837
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,650
and call it a day?

838
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,193
Because I'm trying
to prove a point.

839
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:09,404
There is no way to win.

840
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,865
Stop saying that.

841
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:14,409
There! You see?

842
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,036
We're all as good as dead.

843
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:19,122
Doctor... take it easy.

844
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,792
It's just a game.
You're right.

845
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:24,670
It's not as if
900 billion lives
were at stake.

846
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:33,929
I just got word.

847
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:35,138
Starfleet rejected
our recommendations.

848
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,640
JACK:
I knew it!

849
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,266
LAUREN:
It's kind of a relief
in a way.

850
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,352
I mean, who wants
to wave a white flag?

851
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,770
They're the cowards.

852
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,271
They don't have the courage
to see the truth.

853
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,398
You may be right but there's
nothing we can do.

854
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:46,984
No, no, no, we can't
just take this lying down.

855
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:48,527
The stakes are too high.

856
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:50,069
We've got to take matters
into our own hands.

857
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:52,906
How, Jack?
What can we do?

858
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:55,575
BASHIR:
We can't force
Starfleet to surrender.

859
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:58,829
If we can't head off the war,
then there might be a way
to make it a lot less bloody.

860
00:33:58,829 --> 00:33:59,913
How?

861
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:01,957
Look at this--

862
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:03,959
Starfleet battle plans,
uh, fleet deployments.

863
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:06,753
Do you know what the Dominion
could do with this information?

864
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:09,255
They could take the Alpha
Quadrant in a matter of weeks.

865
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:11,925
With a lot fewer
Federation casualties
than in a drawn-out war.

866
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:14,135
There wouldn't be more than
two billion casualties.

867
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,054
That's a lot better
than 900 billion.

868
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:20,017
Wait a minute!

869
00:34:20,017 --> 00:34:22,561
It's one thing for us
to try and avert a war,

870
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:25,772
but it's quite another
for us to take it on ourselves
to trigger an invasion

871
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,649
that's going to get
a lot of people killed.

872
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,609
It's not<i> our</i> place to decide
who lives and who dies.

873
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:30,903
We're not gods.

874
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:33,196
Maybe not, but we're
the next best thing.

875
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,781
Can you hear yourself?

876
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,283
That's precisely
the kind of thinking

877
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,284
that makes people
afraid of us.

878
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,661
I don't care.

879
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:41,287
I'm willing to make
this decision.

880
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:42,998
It's not our decision
to make.

881
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:45,000
We presented our case
to Starfleet.

882
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,002
They rejected it.
Case closed.

883
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:49,254
Not closed!
We're going through with this.

884
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:51,757
Well, I'm not going to be
a party to treason.

885
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:54,092
Call it what you want,
but I am willing to do it

886
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,469
if it means saving
billions of lives, hm, hm.

887
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,932
So are you with
us? Hm, hm?

888
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:02,893
No! Haven't you
been listening?

889
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:04,728
Fine!

890
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:10,149
Mmm...

891
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:14,905
So how do we contact
the Dominion?

892
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:26,541
(<i> sighs</i> )

893
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,002
(<i> door opening</i> )

894
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:31,212
WEYOUN:
Still at it, I see.

895
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:32,881
I've been looking over

896
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:34,967
Sisko's latest
counterproposal.

897
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:37,803
We don't seem to be
getting anywhere with him.

898
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:39,721
Not very encouraging,
is it?

899
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,681
I don't know
why you had me

900
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:44,101
call for peace talks
in the first place.

901
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:49,022
My, my. How quickly
you've taken to your new role.

902
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:51,399
And to think,
only a short time ago

903
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:54,945
you were nothing more
than Gul Dukat's Adjutant.

904
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:57,572
I appreciate the faith
you've shown in me.

905
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,616
Then show some faith in me.

906
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:03,829
Don't be like your predecessor,
second-guessing my every move.

907
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:07,540
It should be clear to you by now
that no one is irreplaceable.

908
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,085
Now...

909
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:14,965
I just received
a very interesting message

910
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:17,009
from an unidentified party

911
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:18,927
claiming to have
some information

912
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:21,013
that could be
very beneficial to us.

913
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:22,639
What sort of information?

914
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:23,932
I don't know,

915
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,809
but we're going
to find out.

916
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:37,946
Computer...

917
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,992
Computer, respond.

918
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,790
Sarina, where is everyone?

919
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,086
Did they arrange a meeting
with the Dominion?

920
00:36:56,506 --> 00:37:01,053
Listen, we have to stop them
before it's too late.

921
00:37:01,053 --> 00:37:02,595
Untie me.

922
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,516
Please, Sarina.

923
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,561
You don't want
the deaths

924
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,938
of so many people on your hands.

925
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,941
It's Jack,
isn't it?

926
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,484
Are you worried
what he'll think?

927
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,777
I've seen the way
you look at him

928
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,321
when you think
no one's watching.

929
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,574
I know
how much you care,

930
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,743
but if you don't help me
stop them,

931
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:26,327
you know what's going to happen?

932
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:32,167
They're going to be arrested
and charged with treason

933
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:35,294
and you're never going to see
any of them again.

934
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:37,505
You're never going to see
Jack again.

935
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:45,931
I'm Patrick.

936
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:47,432
Patrick!

937
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:48,516
Come on.

938
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,112
Hello, everyone.

939
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:01,738
He's not supposed
to be here.

940
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:03,615
No, no, no,
he's not.

941
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:05,158
I-I don't understand.

942
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:07,077
Well, why don't we all go back
to your quarters

943
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:09,454
and I will explain it to you.

944
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:11,206
<i>No.</i> We've got to do this.

945
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:12,498
Lives are at stake.

946
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,167
Don't interfere, Julian.

947
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:15,627
You have no right.

948
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:17,879
You're in enough trouble
already, Jack.

949
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:19,464
Don't make it any worse.

950
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,216
Now, we
can do this

951
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:23,301
the easy way...

952
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,470
or the hard way.

953
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,555
It's up to you.

954
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:31,268
Where are they?

955
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:32,310
They'll be here.

956
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,728
This is ridiculous.

957
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,439
Sneaking into a storage bay
for a secret meeting.

958
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:39,109
I'm not some agent
of the Obsidian Order.

959
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:40,193
I'm the leader
of the Cardassian Empire.

960
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:41,694
Don't let it
go to your head.

961
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:44,405
You serve only at the
Dominion's pleasure.

962
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,032
Besides, I think
it's exciting.

963
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,366
(<i> door opens</i> )

964
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:48,576
They're here.

965
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:54,499
Odo?

966
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:56,584
Yes, I know.

967
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,212
I honor you with my presence.

968
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:02,548
We... seem to have
gotten ourselves lost.

969
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:03,508
Mm-hmm.

970
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,510
They're not coming.

971
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:07,679
Who's not coming?

972
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,181
(<i> chuckles</i> )

973
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:12,100
I had a feeling
you were going to say that.

974
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,145
Shall I escort you
to your quarters?

975
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:23,987
BASHIR:
Captain Sisko has decided
not to press charges.

976
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:25,197
You won't be going
to prison.

977
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:26,323
What are they going to do
to us?

978
00:39:26,323 --> 00:39:27,824
Nothing bad.

979
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:29,450
You'll be going back
to the Institute together.

980
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,369
It doesn't matter
what happens to us.

981
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,246
Don't you realize
what you've done, hm?

982
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:35,414
I've kept<i> you</i>
from committing treason.

983
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:37,125
Are we supposed to thank you?

984
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:39,294
900 billion people
are going to die.

985
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:40,461
You don't know that.

986
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,713
Didn't you sit here

987
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,131
and go through the
projections with us?

988
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:44,216
Hm, hm, hm? Didn't you?

989
00:39:44,216 --> 00:39:45,342
He was here, Jack.

990
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:46,425
I remember.

991
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:48,220
Maybe our projections
were wrong.

992
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,470
How can you say that?

993
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,389
We factored in
every contingency, hm.

994
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,390
Every variable.

995
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,017
The equations don't lie.

996
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:55,393
You! You.

997
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,602
You ruined everything.

998
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,355
What do you make
of that, Jack?

999
00:39:58,355 --> 00:40:00,232
Why didn't you
anticipate<i> that?</i>

1000
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:02,525
Why didn't you factor
her into your equation?

1001
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:06,071
Because you thought
you knew everything

1002
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:07,989
but you didn't even know

1003
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,367
what was going to happen
in this room.

1004
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:13,912
One person
derailed your plans.

1005
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:20,835
One person changed
the course of history.

1006
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:24,297
Now, I don't know about you,

1007
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:29,552
but that makes me think
that maybe, just maybe,

1008
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:32,805
things may not turn out
the way we thought.

1009
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:53,492
I heard what happened.

1010
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:55,328
It was a pretty close call.

1011
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:58,581
Yeah. Luckily, I managed
to intercept them in time.

1012
00:40:58,581 --> 00:40:59,707
No, that's not what I meant.

1013
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,293
I was talking
about when

1014
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:03,086
you had to decide
whether or not

1015
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:04,170
to meet with the Dominion.

1016
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:07,382
It can't have been
easy for you.

1017
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:10,676
I know how you wanted to try to
save as many lives as possible.

1018
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:13,471
That's probably what makes you
such a good doctor.

1019
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:17,142
Fortunately, this doctor
is also a Starfleet Officer.

1020
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:21,146
We thought we were so smart.

1021
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:24,690
We thought we could predict
the future.

1022
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,567
It was my fault,

1023
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,611
not theirs.

1024
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:31,323
I should never have let things
go so far.

1025
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:36,202
If I hadn't been so bent on
trying to prove to the world

1026
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:37,996
that they had something
to contribute...

1027
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:39,497
They did contribute.

1028
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:42,208
It seems to me we've become
far too complacent

1029
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,960
about the Dominion.

1030
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,213
We<i> may</i> have driven them back
into Cardassian space,

1031
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:49,215
but we haven't beaten them yet.

1032
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:51,259
I can only hope.

1033
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:54,971
Well, the odds
are stacked against us.

1034
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:57,432
All we can do
is give it our best shot.

1035
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:14,115
You're not going to cause
any more trouble, are you?

1036
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:16,034
Not this time.

1037
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,576
I'll double-down.

1038
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:19,037
Risky.

1039
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:20,746
Maybe there's a better bet

1040
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:23,291
but sometimes when the odds
are so stacked against you,

1041
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:25,418
you've just got
to take a chance.

1042
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:27,462
I admire your courage.

1043
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:30,465
ALL:
Dabo!

1044
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,342
Well, what do you know?

1045
00:42:32,342 --> 00:42:33,759
We have a winner.

1046
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:35,470
<i>O'Brien to Bashir.</i>

1047
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,389
Go ahead.

1048
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:40,392
<i>You wanted to know when</i>
<i>a certain transport</i>
<i>was leaving.</i>

1049
00:42:40,392 --> 00:42:41,976
Oh, thanks.

1050
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:44,437
<i>There is one problem, though.</i>

1051
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:46,898
<i>We've got some passengers</i>
<i>that are refusing to board</i>

1052
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:48,816
<i>unless you come see them.</i>

1053
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:53,779
I didn't think
you'd want to see me again.

1054
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,114
LAUREN:
Believe me

1055
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,657
I wouldn't mind
if our predictions

1056
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:57,700
turned out to be wrong.

1057
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:01,120
Jack's still furious,
but...

1058
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,498
I didn't want to leave
without saying good-bye.

1059
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:07,835
Will you come
visit us?

1060
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,128
What?

1061
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:12,006
Oh, uh, yeah,
I'd like that.

1062
00:43:15,385 --> 00:43:17,387
You did the right
thing, you know.

1063
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,850
One of these days,
he'll understand that.

1064
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:29,482
So... you ready to go?

1065
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:30,858
Not so fast.

1066
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:34,653
There's one thing
I need to know,<i> Doctor.</i>

1067
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:37,073
If-If we can come up with a way
to beat the Dominion,

1068
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:39,451
will you listen?

1069
00:43:39,451 --> 00:43:41,619
I can't think of anything
I'd like better.

1070
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,996
Good.

1071
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,457
Good, good, all right,
let's go then.

1072
00:43:45,457 --> 00:43:46,499
Let's go.

1073
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:47,792
Bashir to O'Brien.

1074
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:50,295
Four to beam out.
