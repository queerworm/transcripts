1
00:00:06,672 --> 00:00:08,107
No, no, it is not there!

2
00:00:08,142 --> 00:00:09,509
Am I the only one here?

3
00:00:09,545 --> 00:00:11,516
Is that it?
Hm-hm-hm? Is that it?

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,388
Am I the only one who sees?
Hm, hm, hm, hm?

5
00:00:14,425 --> 00:00:16,693
And what
is that incessant noise?!

6
00:00:16,731 --> 00:00:18,030
Calm down.

7
00:00:18,068 --> 00:00:19,503
Am I talking too fast,
Doctor?

8
00:00:19,538 --> 00:00:21,064
Having trouble keeping up,
hm, hm, hm?

9
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:23,171
I don't want
to see you get upset, Jack.

10
00:00:23,214 --> 00:00:24,946
Please don't leave
us here, Karen, please!

11
00:00:24,986 --> 00:00:26,820
It's only for a few weeks,
Patrick.

12
00:00:26,857 --> 00:00:27,826
You know why they brought
us here, don't you?

13
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,526
Why they carted us
halfway across the quadrant?

14
00:00:32,372 --> 00:00:33,932
They're going
to experiment on us.

15
00:00:33,975 --> 00:00:35,239
Stop it, Jack.

16
00:00:35,345 --> 00:00:36,678
They want to find out what makes

17
00:00:36,716 --> 00:00:38,380
our genetically engineered
brains tick.

18
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,186
They're going
to cut our heads open

19
00:00:40,225 --> 00:00:41,353
and see what comes out!

20
00:00:42,631 --> 00:00:43,964
He's just trying to scare you.

21
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:44,970
Don't listen to him.

22
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:46,234
Now, I told you

23
00:00:46,274 --> 00:00:48,040
why I brought you here,
remember?

24
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,139
Mm-hmm.

25
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:50,880
To meet that doctor,
Dr. Bashir?

26
00:00:50,919 --> 00:00:52,218
You know.

27
00:00:52,256 --> 00:00:53,225
The handsome one.

28
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:55,093
He was genetically enhanced

29
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,728
when he was a boy,
just like all of you.

30
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,103
No, no! He's not like us.

31
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,906
I never saw him
at the Institute.

32
00:01:00,945 --> 00:01:04,249
He wasn't locked away, hm-hm,
for being too smart, hm-hm?

33
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:06,121
He's passed
himself off as normal.

34
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,563
He's Mr. Normal Starfleet man,
mm-hmm.

35
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:10,695
Mr. Productive Member
of Society.

36
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:13,506
Well, maybe we can learn
to be just like him.

37
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:16,683
Wear little uniforms, hm?
Yes, sir!

38
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,848
No, sir!

39
00:01:17,889 --> 00:01:18,880
Thank you, sir!

40
00:01:18,925 --> 00:01:20,224
I don't like it here.

41
00:01:20,262 --> 00:01:22,461
It's going to be all right.

42
00:01:22,502 --> 00:01:24,302
Dr. Bashir is going
to work with you

43
00:01:24,406 --> 00:01:25,636
for a while, that's all.

44
00:01:25,676 --> 00:01:26,804
Just think of it

45
00:01:26,846 --> 00:01:28,646
as a little vacation
from the Institute.

46
00:01:28,684 --> 00:01:30,314
No, no, this is
not happening, no.

47
00:01:30,355 --> 00:01:32,087
It is happening, Jack,
and you're going

48
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:34,029
to have to try
to make the best of it.

49
00:01:34,064 --> 00:01:36,332
I'm going to make
the best of it.

50
00:01:36,404 --> 00:01:38,500
See the way he's looking at me?

51
00:01:38,543 --> 00:01:40,343
He's in love with me already.

52
00:01:40,414 --> 00:01:41,940
Give me that!

53
00:01:41,985 --> 00:01:43,751
I want to go home.

54
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:46,354
It's him.

55
00:01:49,572 --> 00:01:50,700
See that?

56
00:01:50,741 --> 00:01:52,871
That's what I'm going to do
to your boyfriend.

57
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,476
Give me the padd.

58
00:02:01,135 --> 00:02:02,969
Sorry.

59
00:02:03,006 --> 00:02:04,168
You're not sorry.

60
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:06,009
We both know that.

61
00:02:06,047 --> 00:02:08,246
You did it on purpose
because you're upset

62
00:02:08,287 --> 00:02:11,125
but there are better ways
of dealing with being upset.

63
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:14,301
I'll work on it.

64
00:02:16,742 --> 00:02:19,682
All right, well...

65
00:02:19,716 --> 00:02:21,710
I'll see you all in a few weeks.

66
00:02:21,755 --> 00:02:24,387
Patrick, it's fine.
It's fine.

67
00:02:24,496 --> 00:02:25,795
Go on.

68
00:02:29,977 --> 00:02:31,675
Bye, Sarina.

69
00:02:37,763 --> 00:02:38,732
You all right?

70
00:02:38,766 --> 00:02:39,735
Oh, it's nothing.

71
00:02:39,768 --> 00:02:40,896
Just another run-in with Jack.

72
00:02:40,938 --> 00:02:43,102
Like I said in my report

73
00:02:43,144 --> 00:02:44,876
don't turn your back on him.

74
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:46,282
Well, we better get you down
to the Infirmary.

75
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,051
I'm fine. You go on in.

76
00:02:48,091 --> 00:02:49,583
They're about as ready
to meet you

77
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,689
as they'll ever be.

78
00:02:51,733 --> 00:02:52,997
I just hope you
have better luck

79
00:02:53,036 --> 00:02:54,631
getting through to them
than I've had.

80
00:04:57,987 --> 00:04:59,013
Hello?

81
00:05:01,763 --> 00:05:04,429
Funny. He doesn't look
like a mutant.

82
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,837
Is that you, Jack?

83
00:05:05,874 --> 00:05:07,366
He knows me.
He knows my name.

84
00:05:07,411 --> 00:05:08,744
I didn't tell him my name.

85
00:05:08,781 --> 00:05:09,807
It's all right.

86
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,481
I just read Dr. Loews' report,
that's all.

87
00:05:11,522 --> 00:05:12,821
I knew that.

88
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,256
Hello, Sarina.

89
00:05:16,301 --> 00:05:18,033
What is he talking to her for?

90
00:05:18,072 --> 00:05:19,041
He read the reports.

91
00:05:19,075 --> 00:05:20,044
She won't answer you.

92
00:05:20,077 --> 00:05:22,743
Didn't you read
the reports? Hm-hm-hm?

93
00:05:22,785 --> 00:05:25,691
Would anyone mind
if I turned on the lights?

94
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,959
Would anyone mind
if he turns on some lights?

95
00:05:27,998 --> 00:05:29,399
Go ahead, we're not mole people,
you know.

96
00:05:29,435 --> 00:05:30,495
Computer, lights.

97
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,475
Hello.

98
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,979
Lauren.

99
00:05:34,014 --> 00:05:35,882
I know what you're thinking,
Julian

100
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,286
but I'm not that kind of girl.

101
00:05:37,322 --> 00:05:38,484
Bashir, was it? Hm.

102
00:05:38,526 --> 00:05:39,825
Rings a bell, rings a bell.

103
00:05:39,862 --> 00:05:41,229
Bashir, Bashir,
Bashir, Bashir, Bashir...

104
00:05:41,266 --> 00:05:42,360
Ah, got it, got it!

105
00:05:42,402 --> 00:05:44,236
15th-century poet...
Singh el Bashir.

106
00:05:44,274 --> 00:05:45,243
Any relation?

107
00:05:45,277 --> 00:05:46,246
Yes, actually.

108
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,578
His work was totally derivative.

109
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:48,879
He was a plagiarist.

110
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:50,252
You knew that.
You had to know that.

111
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:51,259
Yet you come in here

112
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:52,352
bragging about it anyway,
hm, hm.

113
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:53,557
Why? Hm? Hm?

114
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,933
You're the one
who brought it up.

115
00:05:55,971 --> 00:05:57,304
Well, what was I
supposed to do...

116
00:05:57,341 --> 00:05:59,039
just let you get away
with it?! Hm-hm-hm?

117
00:05:59,146 --> 00:06:00,308
That noise!

118
00:06:00,349 --> 00:06:02,583
Tell me, Doctor,
what kind of enhancements

119
00:06:02,621 --> 00:06:04,421
did your parents
have done to you?

120
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:06,589
Mental abilities, mostly

121
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:08,762
but they had
my hand/eye coordination

122
00:06:08,804 --> 00:06:11,470
reflexes and vision
improved as well.

123
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:15,746
Can you do that? Hm-hm-hm?

124
00:06:15,788 --> 00:06:17,018
I doubt it.

125
00:06:17,058 --> 00:06:18,425
Yeah, what happened?

126
00:06:18,463 --> 00:06:21,369
Uh, your parents couldn't afford
the full overhaul, hm-hm?

127
00:06:21,403 --> 00:06:23,033
He turned out all right.

128
00:06:23,141 --> 00:06:25,670
You're not exactly known for
being very discriminating, hm?

129
00:06:25,714 --> 00:06:27,183
I turned you down, didn't I?

130
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:29,453
And you're still regretting it!

131
00:06:29,491 --> 00:06:31,895
The cube root of 329...
what is it?

132
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:34,562
6.903.

133
00:06:34,604 --> 00:06:36,164
Very good!

134
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,578
And you didn't even use
your fingers.

135
00:06:38,615 --> 00:06:41,087
He's a mutant,
just like the rest of us.

136
00:06:41,188 --> 00:06:42,852
No, no, no, he is not like us.

137
00:06:42,893 --> 00:06:44,226
He passed as normal.

138
00:06:44,263 --> 00:06:45,232
Is that true?

139
00:06:45,265 --> 00:06:46,757
Did you pass as normal?
Is that true?

140
00:06:46,803 --> 00:06:48,933
My genetic status was
discovered a year ago.

141
00:06:48,974 --> 00:06:51,846
How'd you manage to hide it
for so long?

142
00:06:51,882 --> 00:06:55,585
I did my best
not to exploit my abilities.

143
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,596
Mm-mmm,
so no one would suspect.

144
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,624
Very clever. I'm impressed.

145
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,002
Now, that's not right!

146
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,774
There are reasons why DNA
resequencing is illegal.

147
00:07:03,813 --> 00:07:05,750
There are reasons
why people like us

148
00:07:05,785 --> 00:07:07,585
are barred from serving
in Starfleet.

149
00:07:07,623 --> 00:07:08,853
We have an advantage.

150
00:07:08,893 --> 00:07:10,488
Normal people can't compete.
It's not fair.

151
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:11,500
Maybe you're right.

152
00:07:11,533 --> 00:07:12,900
Maybe I should have
said something sooner.

153
00:07:12,937 --> 00:07:14,099
There are rules...

154
00:07:14,141 --> 00:07:15,771
uh, uh, don't talk
with your mouth full

155
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:17,873
don't open an airlock
when somebody's inside it

156
00:07:17,917 --> 00:07:19,911
and don't lie
about your genetic status.

157
00:07:19,955 --> 00:07:21,447
No, no, no, you did.
You lied.

158
00:07:21,492 --> 00:07:23,794
You'd lied, and-and then
when you got caught

159
00:07:23,832 --> 00:07:25,962
you cut a deal with Starfleet,
hm, hm, hm, hm?

160
00:07:26,004 --> 00:07:27,634
You-you got yourself
off the hook.

161
00:07:27,675 --> 00:07:28,803
If you'd told the truth

162
00:07:28,845 --> 00:07:30,782
you could have lived with us
at the Institute.

163
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:31,808
Hm, he's right, you know.

164
00:07:31,853 --> 00:07:33,483
Then they would have
put you away.

165
00:07:33,523 --> 00:07:34,856
They don't put people away

166
00:07:34,894 --> 00:07:36,090
for being genetically
engineered.

167
00:07:36,131 --> 00:07:37,897
No, no, no, no,
they just won't let you

168
00:07:37,936 --> 00:07:39,371
do anything that's worth doing!

169
00:07:39,406 --> 00:07:41,377
No, no, they are afraid
that people like us

170
00:07:41,411 --> 00:07:42,471
are going to take over!

171
00:07:42,514 --> 00:07:43,574
Well, it happened before.

172
00:07:43,617 --> 00:07:45,086
People like us
did try and take over.

173
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,612
Oh, no, no, I knew you
were going to do that.

174
00:07:46,657 --> 00:07:49,061
I knew that you were going
to trot out the Eugenics War.

175
00:07:49,097 --> 00:07:50,066
I'm not trotting out anything.

176
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,592
All I'm saying is
there's a good reason

177
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,403
why we've been barred
from certain professions

178
00:07:53,442 --> 00:07:54,706
but that doesn't
mean we can't be

179
00:07:54,745 --> 00:07:55,907
productive members of society.

180
00:07:55,948 --> 00:07:56,917
Yeah, here it comes...

181
00:07:56,951 --> 00:07:58,888
the "We Can Still Contribute"
speech.

182
00:07:58,923 --> 00:08:00,392
No, no, no, no.

183
00:08:00,426 --> 00:08:02,329
I will not forget
what was done to me.

184
00:08:02,366 --> 00:08:04,064
I will not be
a part of a society

185
00:08:04,103 --> 00:08:06,131
that put me away
for being too smart! No, no!

186
00:08:06,175 --> 00:08:07,439
All right, then.

187
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:10,317
Seeing as though you have
all the answers already

188
00:08:10,352 --> 00:08:11,947
I'll spare you the speech.

189
00:08:17,638 --> 00:08:19,438
I'm having dinner
with some friends.

190
00:08:19,476 --> 00:08:21,310
What? You think we
don't eat? We eat.

191
00:08:21,348 --> 00:08:22,749
We're going to eat right now.

192
00:08:22,785 --> 00:08:23,879
Hm? Y-Yum-yum.

193
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:25,254
I'll go set the table.

194
00:08:30,371 --> 00:08:31,499
Don't worry about us.

195
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:32,669
We'll be fine. Hm.

196
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:35,651
Thanks for scaring him off.

197
00:08:41,032 --> 00:08:42,592
All I kept thinking was

198
00:08:42,637 --> 00:08:44,939
"There, but for
the grace of God, go I."

199
00:08:44,976 --> 00:08:47,278
How do you mean?

200
00:08:47,315 --> 00:08:49,651
My parents managed
to find a decent doctor

201
00:08:49,688 --> 00:08:51,784
to perform the DNA
resequencing on me.

202
00:08:51,827 --> 00:08:53,296
These four weren't so lucky.

203
00:08:53,364 --> 00:08:56,304
They all suffered
unintended side effects

204
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:58,139
and by the time
they were five or six

205
00:08:58,177 --> 00:09:00,148
their parents were forced
to come forward

206
00:09:00,182 --> 00:09:01,880
and admit they'd broken the law

207
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,891
so that their children
could get treatment.

208
00:09:03,925 --> 00:09:06,227
Hm. Perhaps they waited
too long.

209
00:09:07,702 --> 00:09:08,898
Yeah. There was nothing

210
00:09:08,938 --> 00:09:11,433
the doctors at the Institute
could do for them.

211
00:09:11,478 --> 00:09:14,418
These cases are so rare.
There's no standard treatment.

212
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:15,581
I can't imagine

213
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:17,593
it was a very stimulating
environment for them.

214
00:09:17,627 --> 00:09:19,028
That's what Dr. Loews thought

215
00:09:19,064 --> 00:09:20,830
when she first came
to the Institute.

216
00:09:20,869 --> 00:09:23,273
She got permission to separate
them from the other residents

217
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:24,608
so that she could work
with them.

218
00:09:24,645 --> 00:09:26,616
Why did she bring them here?

219
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,418
She thought they might respond

220
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,657
to meeting someone
like them who was leading

221
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:34,329
a normal life.

222
00:09:34,371 --> 00:09:36,342
She was also hoping that one day

223
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:40,112
they might be able to live
on their own and be productive.

224
00:09:40,153 --> 00:09:42,489
Well, let's hope they
don't become too productive.

225
00:09:42,526 --> 00:09:44,156
Might make the rest of us
look bad.

226
00:09:45,499 --> 00:09:46,934
It is not a laughing matter.

227
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,534
If people like them are
allowed to compete freely

228
00:09:49,577 --> 00:09:51,275
then parents would
feel pressured

229
00:09:51,315 --> 00:09:54,049
to have their children enhanced
so they could keep up.

230
00:09:54,088 --> 00:09:58,327
That's precisely what prompted
the ban on DNA resequencing

231
00:09:58,366 --> 00:09:59,926
in the first place.

232
00:10:01,441 --> 00:10:02,910
Giving them
a chance to contribute

233
00:10:02,945 --> 00:10:05,075
doesn't necessarily
mean sanctioning

234
00:10:05,117 --> 00:10:06,747
what was done to them.

235
00:10:06,788 --> 00:10:09,590
They didn't ask
to have their DNA tampered with.

236
00:10:09,629 --> 00:10:11,600
They were only children.

237
00:10:11,634 --> 00:10:13,103
And why should they be excluded

238
00:10:13,137 --> 00:10:15,108
just because their parents
broke the law?

239
00:10:15,143 --> 00:10:16,635
You're right.

240
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,118
It's not quite fair...

241
00:10:19,153 --> 00:10:23,563
but even so, it seemed like
a good way to discourage

242
00:10:23,598 --> 00:10:24,726
genetic tampering.

243
00:10:24,768 --> 00:10:26,032
Besides, it's not as if

244
00:10:26,071 --> 00:10:27,803
we're trying to exclude them
from anything.

245
00:10:27,843 --> 00:10:29,814
We're just... talking about...

246
00:10:29,848 --> 00:10:31,842
you know, limiting
what they're allowed to do.

247
00:10:31,886 --> 00:10:34,154
Like joining Starfleet.

248
00:10:34,192 --> 00:10:35,125
Exactly.

249
00:10:35,162 --> 00:10:36,131
Are you saying

250
00:10:36,164 --> 00:10:37,292
that I shouldn't be allowed

251
00:10:37,334 --> 00:10:38,496
to wear this uniform?

252
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,804
Well, you are an exception.

253
00:10:40,843 --> 00:10:42,871
Ah, an exception.

254
00:10:42,915 --> 00:10:44,077
I should be used to that.

255
00:10:44,118 --> 00:10:45,850
I've been one all my life...

256
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,192
first, because
of the DNA resequencing

257
00:10:48,229 --> 00:10:52,866
and now, because I've been
allowed to join Starfleet.

258
00:10:52,908 --> 00:10:55,676
Perhaps I should not
have said anything.

259
00:10:55,715 --> 00:10:58,244
No. No, it's all right.

260
00:11:01,597 --> 00:11:04,503
Well,
does anyone care to speculate

261
00:11:04,572 --> 00:11:07,876
about what Gul Damar
is going to say in his speech?

262
00:11:07,913 --> 00:11:09,884
Nothing we're going to like,
I'll bet.

263
00:11:09,918 --> 00:11:11,684
It should be starting
any minute.

264
00:11:11,723 --> 00:11:15,187
If he's going to announce
another new battle offensive

265
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:17,762
it's going to spoil dessert.

266
00:11:17,806 --> 00:11:18,934
Can you hear me?

267
00:11:18,976 --> 00:11:20,536
H-Hello, calling Dr. Bashir.

268
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:21,878
Jack...

269
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,546
Hello. Anybody there? Hm-hm?

270
00:11:23,654 --> 00:11:26,149
Did you give them access
to the com system?

271
00:11:26,194 --> 00:11:27,789
Hello? Hello? Dr. Bashir? Hm?

272
00:11:27,832 --> 00:11:30,100
No, they must have
broken in somehow. Oh!

273
00:11:30,137 --> 00:11:35,447
I'd love to stay and chat
about our impending doom, but...

274
00:11:41,947 --> 00:11:43,416
I can't take it!

275
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,686
Would you do something
about that noise!

276
00:11:45,724 --> 00:11:46,750
What noise?

277
00:11:46,793 --> 00:11:49,858
What kind of sick game
are you people playing, hm?!

278
00:11:49,901 --> 00:11:51,565
What are you talking about?

279
00:11:51,606 --> 00:11:52,734
Can't you hear it?!

280
00:11:52,776 --> 00:11:55,648
We complained, and two
very cute engineers came by

281
00:11:55,683 --> 00:11:56,982
and said there
was nothing wrong.

282
00:11:57,019 --> 00:11:57,988
Wait a minute.

283
00:11:58,022 --> 00:11:59,321
Is it a kind
of high-pitched whine?

284
00:11:59,426 --> 00:12:00,690
Yes! Thank God!

285
00:12:00,729 --> 00:12:03,133
See? I told you
we weren't crazy.

286
00:12:03,169 --> 00:12:05,265
Hm-hm-hm?

287
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,678
You are a mutant.

288
00:12:07,714 --> 00:12:08,944
You are.

289
00:12:08,985 --> 00:12:11,219
Now, do something
about that noise

290
00:12:11,257 --> 00:12:12,852
or I will snap her neck.

291
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:21,650
I called Chief O'Brien.

292
00:12:21,684 --> 00:12:23,484
Now, let her go.

293
00:12:23,522 --> 00:12:24,889
Maybe I'll wait
until he gets here.

294
00:12:24,926 --> 00:12:26,452
If you don't let her go

295
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,900
I'll tell the Chief
the noise went away

296
00:12:28,936 --> 00:12:29,927
by itself.

297
00:12:29,972 --> 00:12:31,966
You think I want
to be doing this?

298
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:34,209
I'm just making sure
things get done.

299
00:12:39,063 --> 00:12:40,191
Unbelievable.

300
00:12:40,232 --> 00:12:41,964
This is the thanks I get.

301
00:12:42,003 --> 00:12:43,701
Are you all right?

302
00:12:47,751 --> 00:12:49,551
Come in.

303
00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:51,560
Miles...

304
00:12:51,595 --> 00:12:54,728
I wonder if you could find out
what's making that noise.

305
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:57,140
I know you can't hear it,
but it's there...

306
00:12:57,175 --> 00:12:58,975
probably a sympathetic
vibration

307
00:12:59,014 --> 00:13:00,985
in the power coupling
or something.

308
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,580
What do you know?
You're right.

309
00:13:02,623 --> 00:13:05,027
Well, why don't you fix it,
dear fellow, dear fellow?

310
00:13:05,063 --> 00:13:06,362
Well, why don't you fix it

311
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,394
before I go mad?!

312
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:18,796
He's married.

313
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:20,324
Too bad.

314
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:25,846
Sounds like the plasma
flow's out of sync.

315
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,589
You're right.

316
00:13:28,624 --> 00:13:30,595
Better realign it.

317
00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:31,598
I was just thinking that.

318
00:13:31,632 --> 00:13:33,296
Yeah. Ooh!

319
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:36,573
It's about to start.

320
00:13:36,611 --> 00:13:38,582
Almost finished.

321
00:13:40,354 --> 00:13:41,618
There.

322
00:13:41,658 --> 00:13:42,627
Finally.

323
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,129
Ah!

324
00:13:44,165 --> 00:13:46,329
Much better.
Thank you, Chief.

325
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,102
Fellow citizens

326
00:13:48,142 --> 00:13:50,580
these are great days
for Cardassia.

327
00:13:50,615 --> 00:13:53,144
Together,
with our Dominion allies

328
00:13:53,188 --> 00:13:57,153
we have given our enemies
cause to fear us once more.

329
00:13:57,198 --> 00:13:58,497
Can't argue with that.

330
00:13:58,536 --> 00:13:59,664
Who's he?

331
00:13:59,704 --> 00:14:02,176
It's Damar, the new head
of the Cardassian government.

332
00:14:02,211 --> 00:14:04,945
"Uneasy lies the head
that wears the crown."

333
00:14:04,985 --> 00:14:06,113
He's sad.

334
00:14:06,155 --> 00:14:07,853
Ashamed is more like it.

335
00:14:07,892 --> 00:14:08,952
Why do you say that?

336
00:14:08,995 --> 00:14:09,964
Shh!

337
00:14:09,998 --> 00:14:11,092
...we are poised to make

338
00:14:11,135 --> 00:14:14,303
another bold step
to ensure our future.

339
00:14:14,343 --> 00:14:15,312
Peace!

340
00:14:15,345 --> 00:14:17,009
Looks like a man
who doesn't sleep.

341
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,648
"Methought I heard a voice cry,
'sleep no more!

342
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,320
'Damar does murder sleep."'

343
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,921
He's killed someone!

344
00:14:22,966 --> 00:14:24,492
Someone close to him.

345
00:14:24,536 --> 00:14:25,835
How could they know that?

346
00:14:25,873 --> 00:14:27,639
...shed their blood
to defend their home.

347
00:14:27,677 --> 00:14:31,380
Their sacrifice must not be
in vain.

348
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,684
The peace we seek

349
00:14:32,724 --> 00:14:35,526
will honor their memory
and preserve the gains

350
00:14:35,632 --> 00:14:37,660
for which they gave their lives.

351
00:14:37,703 --> 00:14:42,546
I challenge the Federation
to answer my call for peace.

352
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:46,548
I am ready at any time
to meet with its representatives

353
00:14:46,593 --> 00:14:50,091
to discuss how we can put an end
to hostilities.

354
00:14:50,136 --> 00:14:51,332
As your leader...

355
00:14:51,372 --> 00:14:53,434
Pretender! You don't belong
on that throne, and you know it.

356
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:55,505
...everything in my power
to protect Cardassia.

357
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,714
Someone's making him say
all this. He doesn't want to.

358
00:14:57,755 --> 00:14:59,247
...forward into a new era.

359
00:14:59,293 --> 00:15:03,360
This I vow
with my life's blood...

360
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,807
for my sons...

361
00:15:05,843 --> 00:15:08,577
for all our sons.

362
00:15:10,756 --> 00:15:13,126
Did any of you know who
Damar was before today?

363
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,430
No, no, no,
but it's obvious who he is.

364
00:15:15,468 --> 00:15:16,732
The pretender...

365
00:15:16,771 --> 00:15:19,073
...who-who killed the king
and seized the throne.

366
00:15:19,111 --> 00:15:20,843
Not the king.
He's still alive.

367
00:15:20,882 --> 00:15:22,408
Oh, the queen, maybe...

368
00:15:22,453 --> 00:15:24,287
- Or a princess.
- Mmm.

369
00:15:24,325 --> 00:15:25,294
Yes. Ziyal.

370
00:15:25,327 --> 00:15:26,762
That's Gul Dukat's daughter.

371
00:15:26,798 --> 00:15:28,598
And now, the pretender

372
00:15:28,635 --> 00:15:30,799
finds himself in league
with a-a-a dark knight

373
00:15:30,841 --> 00:15:32,276
that he can't control. Hm, hm?

374
00:15:32,312 --> 00:15:33,440
Weyoun?

375
00:15:33,481 --> 00:15:34,780
It's not a bad story.

376
00:15:34,818 --> 00:15:36,310
Epic, really.

377
00:15:37,926 --> 00:15:40,194
What else can you tell us?
Hm, hm?

378
00:15:42,271 --> 00:15:43,240
It was amazing.

379
00:15:43,274 --> 00:15:45,268
They pieced together
the entire story

380
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:46,747
of how Damar came to power.

381
00:15:46,782 --> 00:15:48,183
Weyoun is the dark prince

382
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,780
Gul Dukat is the deposed king

383
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,054
Damar is the pretender

384
00:15:51,094 --> 00:15:52,586
to the throne, and Ziyal is

385
00:15:52,631 --> 00:15:53,930
the innocent princess
he murdered.

386
00:15:53,968 --> 00:15:56,566
And now the pretender is wracked
with guilt over what he's done.

387
00:15:56,608 --> 00:15:59,342
And they got all this just
from watching Damar's speech?

388
00:15:59,383 --> 00:16:01,115
Oh, they were fascinated
by the whole thing.

389
00:16:01,153 --> 00:16:02,281
They kept bombarding me

390
00:16:02,323 --> 00:16:04,055
with questions
about Cardassia and the war.

391
00:16:04,094 --> 00:16:05,586
I've never seen them so engaged.

392
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,192
And you want
to keep them engaged.

393
00:16:07,236 --> 00:16:08,637
I'd like to try.

394
00:16:08,672 --> 00:16:10,575
I'm just running
out of material.

395
00:16:10,611 --> 00:16:11,408
What do you mean?

396
00:16:11,447 --> 00:16:12,416
Well, they've already gone

397
00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:13,611
through everything
the computer has

398
00:16:13,652 --> 00:16:14,643
on Cardassia and the Dominion.

399
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,662
Roll out the red carpet.

400
00:16:18,698 --> 00:16:19,667
Visitors?

401
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:23,336
Starfleet has decided to listen
to what Damar has to say.

402
00:16:23,378 --> 00:16:26,318
He and Weyoun will be arriving
in the morning

403
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,950
and I am the lucky one
who gets the chance

404
00:16:28,992 --> 00:16:31,191
to sit across the table
from them.

405
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,200
That's great!

406
00:16:32,234 --> 00:16:33,601
It's hard to believe

407
00:16:33,637 --> 00:16:35,471
that the Dominion
really wants peace.

408
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:36,842
I wouldn't be surprised
if they were

409
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:38,816
just stalling for time
in order to regroup.

410
00:16:38,852 --> 00:16:40,846
Sir, is there any chance
I can get a transcript

411
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:41,859
of the negotiations?

412
00:16:41,892 --> 00:16:44,421
You can do better than that.

413
00:16:44,466 --> 00:16:47,268
The Dominion has insisted
on recording the proceedings

414
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:48,741
so that everyone can see

415
00:16:48,776 --> 00:16:51,044
that their desire for peace
is sincere.

416
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,678
Perfect.

417
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:54,920
You shouldn't have agreed
to that, Benjamin.

418
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,227
Now you have to be
on your best behavior.

419
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,534
Hm.

420
00:16:59,572 --> 00:17:01,132
So, the pretender
and his dark knight

421
00:17:01,175 --> 00:17:02,644
are coming to the station,
hm, hm?

422
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,876
And the story's not over, eh?

423
00:17:03,917 --> 00:17:06,219
Peace talks
could be interesting.

424
00:17:06,255 --> 00:17:07,554
I'd say so

425
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:08,619
and the best part is

426
00:17:08,662 --> 00:17:10,394
we're going to have
ringside seats.

427
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:15,943
Mmm-mmm!

428
00:17:22,538 --> 00:17:25,512
Ah, Major!

429
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:27,244
Welcome to Deep Space 9.

430
00:17:27,284 --> 00:17:28,651
How nice to see you again.

431
00:17:28,687 --> 00:17:31,319
Can I give you a word
of advice, Weyoun?

432
00:17:31,361 --> 00:17:32,956
By all means.

433
00:17:32,998 --> 00:17:34,662
You're welcome
to play your little

434
00:17:34,703 --> 00:17:36,606
"we're all friends here" game
with me

435
00:17:36,641 --> 00:17:38,703
but I wouldn't try it
with Captain Sisko.

436
00:17:38,747 --> 00:17:39,943
He's not in the mood.

437
00:17:39,983 --> 00:17:42,113
We're on a mission
of peace, Major.

438
00:17:42,156 --> 00:17:44,720
Maybe he should get in the mood.

439
00:17:51,547 --> 00:17:55,080
This is the border as it existed
before hostilities broke out.

440
00:17:55,122 --> 00:17:57,617
This is the border
we are now proposing.

441
00:17:57,663 --> 00:18:00,762
This arrangement would award
disputed star systems

442
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:04,540
to the side that already has
effective control over them.

443
00:18:04,581 --> 00:18:06,883
On the balance, we are
giving up more than you.

444
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,392
Computer, freeze program.

445
00:18:09,426 --> 00:18:10,395
Computer...

446
00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:11,455
Hi. Uh, listen.

447
00:18:11,499 --> 00:18:13,333
Go to native language mode

448
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,899
and replay time code
7-6-1 through, uh, uh...

449
00:18:15,944 --> 00:18:16,970
7-6-9, hm, hm.

450
00:18:18,282 --> 00:18:22,088
<i>Eee-ja maa'na hoo'va-baa'li</i>
<i>jen'ku'rada sen'to.</i>

451
00:18:22,126 --> 00:18:23,152
Got you!

452
00:18:23,195 --> 00:18:24,755
Did you hear that,
hm, hm, hm?

453
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,602
He used the passive
voice transitive, hm, hm.

454
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,440
Since when could you
speak Dominionese?

455
00:18:29,478 --> 00:18:30,606
Hm, since this morning.

456
00:18:30,648 --> 00:18:33,520
That phrasing is only used
to make a request

457
00:18:33,556 --> 00:18:34,616
not a statement.

458
00:18:34,659 --> 00:18:36,323
They are up to something,
hm, hm, hm.

459
00:18:38,369 --> 00:18:40,272
What is it, Patrick?

460
00:18:40,307 --> 00:18:41,276
Did you see something?

461
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:43,779
You can tell us.

462
00:18:43,815 --> 00:18:47,119
They want the Kabrel system.

463
00:18:47,158 --> 00:18:48,320
How do you know?

464
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,824
They kept avoiding it
with their eyes.

465
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:52,633
Are you sure?

466
00:18:52,672 --> 00:18:54,734
They kept avoiding it.

467
00:18:54,778 --> 00:18:56,840
Told you they were
up to something, hm, hm?

468
00:18:56,883 --> 00:18:59,151
End program.

469
00:19:00,492 --> 00:19:03,021
All right, they want
the Kabrel system, but why?

470
00:19:03,066 --> 00:19:04,764
I don't know,
but they're willing

471
00:19:04,804 --> 00:19:05,932
to give up a lot to get it.

472
00:19:05,974 --> 00:19:08,242
The mizainite deposits
on Holna IV alone

473
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:11,515
are enough to keep their
shipyards running for years.

474
00:19:11,555 --> 00:19:13,458
Yes, yes, yes, that's typical
Dominion strategy.

475
00:19:13,493 --> 00:19:15,019
They offer to give up
something valuable

476
00:19:15,063 --> 00:19:17,000
in order to hide the fact
that they want something

477
00:19:17,035 --> 00:19:18,801
even more valuable
in the long term, hm, hm, hm.

478
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,834
See, that's how they think.
Big picture.

479
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:22,848
They don't worry about what's
going to happen tomorrow.

480
00:19:22,917 --> 00:19:24,284
No, no, no.
They're thinking long term.

481
00:19:24,321 --> 00:19:26,349
They're thinking what's going
to happen a year from now

482
00:19:26,393 --> 00:19:28,387
a-a-a decade, a century,
hm, hm, hm, hm, yes, yes.

483
00:19:28,432 --> 00:19:31,132
There must be something special
about the Kabrel system.

484
00:19:31,172 --> 00:19:33,610
Nothing on the first planet
but some simple

485
00:19:33,645 --> 00:19:35,411
protozoids
and tri-nucleic fungi.

486
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,979
The second planet
has some cormaline deposits

487
00:19:38,023 --> 00:19:39,492
but they're common enough.

488
00:19:39,527 --> 00:19:41,623
Okay, okay, okay, maybe
there's another reason, hm.

489
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,796
Does it have
any strategic value, hm, hm?

490
00:19:44,841 --> 00:19:45,901
Not that I can see.

491
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:47,709
They wouldn't want
to build a base there.

492
00:19:47,748 --> 00:19:49,012
Why not, why not?
Hm, hm?

493
00:19:49,051 --> 00:19:50,042
Seems perfectly suitable.
Hm, hm?

494
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:52,252
It's not an optimum situation.

495
00:19:52,294 --> 00:19:53,593
It's a binary system.

496
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,364
There's a lot
of ionic interference there.

497
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,170
All right, all right,
forget it.

498
00:19:58,209 --> 00:19:59,337
Does this have anything to do

499
00:19:59,378 --> 00:20:00,904
with what we're talking about,
Sarina?

500
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,496
Can we take it?

501
00:20:10,106 --> 00:20:12,670
...like an ancient technology,
hm, hm, hm?

502
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:14,741
There's no evidence
of anything like that.

503
00:20:14,786 --> 00:20:16,950
Any idea what this might mean?

504
00:20:19,264 --> 00:20:21,793
Chemistry was never
my strong suit.

505
00:20:21,837 --> 00:20:22,806
What is it?

506
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:24,103
It shows

507
00:20:24,142 --> 00:20:25,806
how you can break down
tri-nucleic fungus

508
00:20:25,847 --> 00:20:26,975
to make yridium bicantizine

509
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,011
one of the active ingredients
in ketracel-white.

510
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,992
That's why the Dominion wants
the Kabrel system

511
00:20:31,027 --> 00:20:32,553
so that they can manufacture
the drug

512
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:34,228
right here
in the Alpha Quadrant.

513
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:35,967
According to our calculations

514
00:20:36,006 --> 00:20:38,170
they'll be able
to manufacture enough

515
00:20:38,213 --> 00:20:40,412
to supply the Jem'Hadar
indefinitely.

516
00:20:40,452 --> 00:20:41,921
I was going to recommend

517
00:20:41,956 --> 00:20:44,758
that the Federation accept
the proposed border.

518
00:20:44,796 --> 00:20:47,064
It could've cost us
the Alpha Quadrant.

519
00:20:47,169 --> 00:20:49,698
Actually, sir,
we should give them Kabrel.

520
00:20:49,742 --> 00:20:50,904
Why is that?

521
00:20:50,945 --> 00:20:52,005
If we don't

522
00:20:52,048 --> 00:20:53,608
the Dominion
will be forced to attack

523
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:55,385
before their stockpile of white
runs out.

524
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,892
Here are
the casualty projections.

525
00:20:56,928 --> 00:21:00,334
As you can see,
an attack would result

526
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,034
in devastating casualties
for both sides.

527
00:21:02,074 --> 00:21:04,546
Y-You're suggesting we stall?

528
00:21:04,581 --> 00:21:07,213
It will buy us time
to rebuild our defenses

529
00:21:07,254 --> 00:21:09,818
and bring the Romulans
into the alliance.

530
00:21:09,862 --> 00:21:11,833
The Romulans.

531
00:21:11,867 --> 00:21:13,166
According to our analysis...

532
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,079
there it is...

533
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,946
they'll vote to abandon
their nonaggression pact

534
00:21:18,985 --> 00:21:20,853
with the Dominion
at next year's plenary session.

535
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:22,690
By which time,
internal pressures

536
00:21:22,728 --> 00:21:25,634
between the Cardassians and
the Dominion will have erupted

537
00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:26,763
and after three years

538
00:21:26,806 --> 00:21:29,644
six months and 27 days,
we predict that, uh...

539
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:30,841
Hang on a minute, Doctor.

540
00:21:30,882 --> 00:21:32,283
How'd you come up with all this?

541
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:33,811
Two days ago,
you said these people

542
00:21:33,857 --> 00:21:35,121
were impossible to deal with.

543
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,652
Now they're
turning out projections

544
00:21:36,697 --> 00:21:38,793
that it would take
Starfleet Intelligence months

545
00:21:38,837 --> 00:21:40,501
to come up with.

546
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:41,510
We're mutants.

547
00:21:41,543 --> 00:21:43,012
I know.

548
00:21:43,048 --> 00:21:44,985
We're not exactly qualified
for this kind of work

549
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:48,484
and it could be said that, uh...
it is beyond the limits

550
00:21:48,528 --> 00:21:52,300
of what people like us
should be allowed to do.

551
00:21:52,338 --> 00:21:54,138
But I think if you allow me

552
00:21:54,176 --> 00:21:56,375
to walk you
through our analyses

553
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,512
you'll be impressed.

554
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:04,335
All right, Doctor, go ahead.

555
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:06,136
Thank you, sir.

556
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:09,340
The way
our statistical analysis works

557
00:22:09,383 --> 00:22:11,251
the further
into the future you go

558
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,156
the more accurate
the projection.

559
00:22:13,193 --> 00:22:15,392
It's based on a kind
of nonlinear dynamics

560
00:22:15,431 --> 00:22:17,926
whereby small fluctuations
tend to factor out over time.

561
00:22:17,971 --> 00:22:19,099
The net result is...

562
00:22:19,141 --> 00:22:20,667
Just a minute, Doctor.

563
00:22:20,712 --> 00:22:22,842
Why don't we go back
to the beginning

564
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:25,949
and take me through this
step-by-step...

565
00:22:25,992 --> 00:22:27,792
nice and easy.

566
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,877
Gladly, sir.

567
00:22:32,848 --> 00:22:35,686
Captain Sisko said he
would take our analyses

568
00:22:35,723 --> 00:22:37,751
to Starfleet Command right away.

569
00:22:37,795 --> 00:22:40,324
Imagine that...
Starfleet Command. Hm.

570
00:22:40,368 --> 00:22:41,837
All those admirals.

571
00:22:41,906 --> 00:22:43,536
It's a party!

572
00:22:43,576 --> 00:22:44,840
It is now.

573
00:22:44,879 --> 00:22:46,178
We need music.

574
00:22:46,216 --> 00:22:47,549
Computer, music.

575
00:22:47,587 --> 00:22:48,715
Make it grand.

576
00:22:48,757 --> 00:22:50,021
A waltz.

577
00:22:54,738 --> 00:22:57,233
Ah!

578
00:22:57,913 --> 00:22:59,816
Care to dance?

579
00:23:33,506 --> 00:23:34,475
Coward.

580
00:23:34,509 --> 00:23:35,637
He tried.

581
00:23:35,678 --> 00:23:37,011
I meant her.

582
00:23:48,812 --> 00:23:50,510
Come in.

583
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:51,951
Chief.

584
00:23:52,054 --> 00:23:53,991
What a pleasant surprise.

585
00:23:55,496 --> 00:23:56,988
I, uh...

586
00:23:58,504 --> 00:24:00,976
I need to replace
that power coupling.

587
00:24:01,011 --> 00:24:02,503
Don't mind us.

588
00:24:10,635 --> 00:24:11,763
Hi.

589
00:24:11,805 --> 00:24:13,104
No, thanks.

590
00:24:13,142 --> 00:24:14,668
It's a party.

591
00:24:14,713 --> 00:24:16,707
No, I need to get to work.

592
00:24:24,572 --> 00:24:26,976
I didn't mean to...

593
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:31,112
It's just that I-I need to get
this coupling replaced.

594
00:24:32,158 --> 00:24:33,992
What did you do, Chief?

595
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,728
Nothing!

596
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:37,533
What's the matter, Patrick?

597
00:24:37,572 --> 00:24:40,136
He doesn't like me.

598
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:42,082
Well, sure, I do.

599
00:24:43,754 --> 00:24:45,452
See?

600
00:24:48,066 --> 00:24:51,040
The Chief doesn't like
any of us.

601
00:24:51,107 --> 00:24:52,508
- Do you, Chief?
- Julian...

602
00:24:52,544 --> 00:24:53,945
He's just jealous

603
00:24:53,982 --> 00:24:55,850
you're spending
so much time with us.

604
00:24:55,887 --> 00:24:57,186
His wife's away.

605
00:24:57,223 --> 00:24:58,522
He misses his friend.

606
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,554
I do not.

607
00:25:00,598 --> 00:25:01,589
It's all right, Julian.

608
00:25:01,635 --> 00:25:02,831
Go play with your friend.

609
00:25:02,871 --> 00:25:03,897
We'll be fine.

610
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:07,039
You want me to play with you,
do you, Chief?

611
00:25:08,151 --> 00:25:09,120
No!

612
00:25:10,156 --> 00:25:11,216
Yes, you do.

613
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:13,754
Come on, let's go to Quark's.

614
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,359
I-I'm going to need those.

615
00:25:15,404 --> 00:25:16,532
No, you don't.

616
00:25:16,574 --> 00:25:18,808
There's nothing wrong
with that power coupling.

617
00:25:21,018 --> 00:25:23,012
Well...

618
00:25:23,057 --> 00:25:27,524
it's... going to have
to be replaced sometime.

619
00:25:29,473 --> 00:25:30,442
Ready?

620
00:25:31,946 --> 00:25:33,142
Ready. Yeah.

621
00:25:35,889 --> 00:25:37,188
I'm sorry.

622
00:25:37,227 --> 00:25:40,429
The last thing in the world
I wanted to do was upset them.

623
00:25:40,469 --> 00:25:41,768
Oh, it's all right.

624
00:25:41,805 --> 00:25:44,607
The only reason
Patrick gets so emotional...

625
00:25:44,646 --> 00:25:46,948
is because he likes you.

626
00:25:46,985 --> 00:25:47,954
He does?

627
00:25:47,988 --> 00:25:49,116
Oh, yeah, they all do.

628
00:25:49,225 --> 00:25:51,128
What? Because I got rid
of that noise?

629
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,529
Oh, no, it's not just that.

630
00:25:52,566 --> 00:25:54,126
They feel comfortable
being around you.

631
00:25:54,171 --> 00:25:55,299
What was the word Jack used?

632
00:25:55,341 --> 00:25:57,677
"Uncomplicated."

633
00:25:58,683 --> 00:26:00,152
Uncomplicated.

634
00:26:00,186 --> 00:26:02,157
Oh, yes, they're
amazingly insightful.

635
00:26:02,192 --> 00:26:04,926
They have ways of seeing things
other people don't.

636
00:26:04,965 --> 00:26:06,936
And saying things
other people don't.

637
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:09,272
Yeah. They are pretty candid,
aren't they?

638
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,008
They sure are.

639
00:26:11,048 --> 00:26:12,347
Funny thing is

640
00:26:12,385 --> 00:26:15,291
I'm actually beginning
to enjoy their company.

641
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:16,794
Hey! What are you doing?

642
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:19,132
Get back!

643
00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:21,471
You know, I was thinking.

644
00:26:21,508 --> 00:26:23,240
Starfleet Command
might do all right

645
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,147
to take them on
as a team of advisers.

646
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:26,483
Oh, I don't know.

647
00:26:26,521 --> 00:26:28,492
Oh, I can't imagine them
in a room

648
00:26:28,527 --> 00:26:30,157
with a bunch of admirals

649
00:26:30,197 --> 00:26:32,499
unless they're going
to teach them how to dance.

650
00:26:32,537 --> 00:26:34,167
We were celebrating.

651
00:26:34,208 --> 00:26:35,700
Yeah, whatever.

652
00:26:37,483 --> 00:26:40,012
Ah, they really
are quite brilliant, though.

653
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:43,030
I mean, once we actually started
working, it was incredible.

654
00:26:43,064 --> 00:26:44,533
We were all
on the same wavelength...

655
00:26:44,568 --> 00:26:47,063
talking in shorthand, finishing
each other's sentences.

656
00:26:47,108 --> 00:26:49,376
I've never had that
with anyone else.

657
00:26:49,414 --> 00:26:51,613
Well, after being with them,
I can understand

658
00:26:51,654 --> 00:26:54,218
how the rest of us must seem
a little uncomplicated.

659
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:57,393
Well, I wouldn't say
that exactly.

660
00:26:57,435 --> 00:26:59,235
More like... slow.

661
00:26:59,307 --> 00:27:01,745
Ha-ha. Must be very
frustrating for you.

662
00:27:02,782 --> 00:27:03,751
I don't mind.

663
00:27:03,785 --> 00:27:05,186
Makes me feel superior.

664
00:27:05,222 --> 00:27:06,191
Oh, glad to be of service.

665
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:07,421
Ah, I appreciate it.

666
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:10,333
It's not always easy walking
amongst the common people.

667
00:27:10,368 --> 00:27:11,359
Ah, it's probably best

668
00:27:11,404 --> 00:27:13,307
to keep your expectations low,
huh?

669
00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:15,478
Ha! That way

670
00:27:15,516 --> 00:27:17,784
we can surprise you
every now and then.

671
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:23,802
Another game?

672
00:27:23,837 --> 00:27:26,241
Sure. But do I have
to stand so far back?

673
00:27:26,343 --> 00:27:27,938
Oh, I-I-I make one lucky shot

674
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:30,249
and you're ready
to come down to my level.

675
00:27:30,353 --> 00:27:32,256
I like to win, just
like the next man.

676
00:27:32,292 --> 00:27:33,784
Get back there.
Come on.

677
00:27:36,949 --> 00:27:37,975
I've got good news.

678
00:27:38,019 --> 00:27:40,013
Starfleet Command was so
impressed with our analysis

679
00:27:40,057 --> 00:27:41,458
they've agreed
to let us have access

680
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:42,793
to classified information

681
00:27:42,831 --> 00:27:44,665
regarding Starfleet's
battle readiness.

682
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:47,365
Is something wrong?

683
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:49,506
We have new
long-term projections.

684
00:27:49,548 --> 00:27:51,382
You-you better take a look.

685
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,357
You're not going to like it.

686
00:28:03,652 --> 00:28:04,621
Well? Hm, hm?

687
00:28:04,654 --> 00:28:06,284
Everything checks out.

688
00:28:06,325 --> 00:28:08,627
I was hoping
you were going to find a flaw.

689
00:28:08,665 --> 00:28:09,964
Nope.

690
00:28:10,002 --> 00:28:11,802
So then you agree
with our conclusion, hm, hm?

691
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,968
It's inescapable.

692
00:28:13,009 --> 00:28:14,205
There's no way the Federation

693
00:28:14,245 --> 00:28:15,977
is going to be able
to beat the Dominion.

694
00:28:16,017 --> 00:28:17,988
We have no choice.

695
00:28:18,022 --> 00:28:19,856
We're going to have
to surrender.

696
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:27,338
Surrender to the Dominion...

697
00:28:27,379 --> 00:28:29,179
not on my watch.

698
00:28:29,218 --> 00:28:31,155
Sir, I understand how you feel.

699
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:33,526
I don't like it
any more than you do

700
00:28:33,562 --> 00:28:36,034
but it's the best option.

701
00:28:36,069 --> 00:28:38,439
We've run dozens
of different scenarios.

702
00:28:38,475 --> 00:28:40,207
Even if something
unlikely were to happen

703
00:28:40,247 --> 00:28:41,614
tilting the scales
in our favor...

704
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:43,553
such as an anti-Dominion
coup on Cardassia...

705
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:45,559
we'll still lose this war.

706
00:28:45,594 --> 00:28:50,061
But that doesn't mean
we just give up and roll over.

707
00:28:50,106 --> 00:28:51,598
But if we fight

708
00:28:51,643 --> 00:28:54,811
there will be over
900 billion casualties.

709
00:28:54,851 --> 00:28:57,825
If we surrender, no one dies.

710
00:28:57,859 --> 00:28:59,830
Either way,
we're in for five generations

711
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:00,833
of Dominion rule.

712
00:29:00,867 --> 00:29:04,331
Eventually a rebellion will
form, centering on Earth.

713
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:06,871
It'll spread...
and within another generation

714
00:29:06,983 --> 00:29:09,478
they'll succeed
in conquering the Dominion.

715
00:29:09,523 --> 00:29:13,056
The Alpha Quadrant will unite
and a new, stronger Federation

716
00:29:13,098 --> 00:29:16,095
will rule
for thousands of years.

717
00:29:16,139 --> 00:29:18,873
But since we can't win this war

718
00:29:18,914 --> 00:29:21,888
why don't we save
as many lives as we can?

719
00:29:23,492 --> 00:29:26,489
I know it's difficult to accept.

720
00:29:28,638 --> 00:29:30,609
I don't accept it.

721
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:32,136
Your entire argument

722
00:29:32,181 --> 00:29:33,309
is based on a series

723
00:29:33,351 --> 00:29:35,949
of statistical probabilities
and assumptions.

724
00:29:35,991 --> 00:29:37,119
They're not just assumptions.

725
00:29:37,161 --> 00:29:39,132
If you want me to take you
through the equations

726
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:40,157
I will.

727
00:29:40,202 --> 00:29:42,731
Even if I knew
with a hundred percent certainty

728
00:29:42,776 --> 00:29:44,143
what was going to happen

729
00:29:44,179 --> 00:29:46,617
I wouldn't ask an entire
generation of people

730
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:48,646
to voluntarily give up
their freedom.

731
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:51,458
Not even to save
over 900 billion lives?

732
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,366
Surrender is not an option!

733
00:29:53,403 --> 00:29:55,340
Now I'm happy to hear
your group's advice

734
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:56,571
on how to win this war

735
00:29:56,611 --> 00:29:59,175
but I don't need your advice
on how to lose it.

736
00:29:59,218 --> 00:30:01,018
We can't win this war.

737
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,027
I don't care if the odds
are against us.

738
00:30:03,061 --> 00:30:04,998
If we're going to lose

739
00:30:05,033 --> 00:30:06,765
then we're going
to go down fighting

740
00:30:06,804 --> 00:30:07,966
so that when our descendants

741
00:30:08,007 --> 00:30:09,773
someday rise up
against the Dominion

742
00:30:09,812 --> 00:30:11,476
they'll know
what they're made of.

743
00:30:11,517 --> 00:30:12,713
With all due respect, sir

744
00:30:12,753 --> 00:30:15,225
aren't you letting your pride
get in your way?

745
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:18,166
All right, Doctor...
you've made your recommendation.

746
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,228
I'll pass it on
to Starfleet Command.

747
00:30:20,273 --> 00:30:22,871
Without adding your voice to it,
they'll dismiss it out of hand.

748
00:30:22,913 --> 00:30:24,884
I'm counting on it.

749
00:30:26,823 --> 00:30:28,919
So we go down fighting.

750
00:30:28,962 --> 00:30:30,933
How terribly courageous of us.

751
00:30:54,428 --> 00:30:57,664
What do you think?

752
00:30:57,704 --> 00:30:59,675
It's pretty grim.

753
00:30:59,709 --> 00:31:01,680
It's not just grim...

754
00:31:01,714 --> 00:31:02,842
it's hopeless.

755
00:31:02,883 --> 00:31:04,683
We can't beat them, Miles.

756
00:31:04,722 --> 00:31:07,251
Well, it doesn't look
like it, does it?

757
00:31:08,765 --> 00:31:11,933
We have to avoid
a long, drawn-out war.

758
00:31:11,973 --> 00:31:13,739
You mean surrender?

759
00:31:13,778 --> 00:31:15,145
I know...

760
00:31:15,181 --> 00:31:17,483
it's an ugly word

761
00:31:17,521 --> 00:31:19,424
but the facts are facts.

762
00:31:19,459 --> 00:31:22,331
I don't know, Julian.

763
00:31:22,367 --> 00:31:24,931
Don't tell me you agree
with the Captain.

764
00:31:24,974 --> 00:31:26,569
I suppose I do.

765
00:31:26,612 --> 00:31:28,948
Well... is there some
part of the analysis

766
00:31:28,985 --> 00:31:30,352
y-you didn't understand?

767
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:33,156
Because if there is,
I-I-I'd be happy to explain.

768
00:31:33,195 --> 00:31:35,359
I understood it perfectly.

769
00:31:35,401 --> 00:31:36,961
Believe it or not.

770
00:31:37,005 --> 00:31:38,497
That's not what I meant.

771
00:31:38,543 --> 00:31:40,377
All I'm saying is

772
00:31:40,414 --> 00:31:43,216
that you have to look
at the bigger picture.

773
00:31:43,254 --> 00:31:46,422
Well, I'm trying, but
maybe I'm too uncomplicated

774
00:31:46,463 --> 00:31:47,693
to see it properly.

775
00:31:47,733 --> 00:31:48,963
I didn't say that.

776
00:31:49,003 --> 00:31:51,065
You don't have to.

777
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:52,773
The way you're acting...

778
00:31:52,813 --> 00:31:54,807
you think nobody
with half a brain

779
00:31:54,852 --> 00:31:56,823
could possibly
disagree with you.

780
00:31:56,857 --> 00:31:59,021
Frankly, I don't
see how they can.

781
00:31:59,063 --> 00:32:02,060
Well, I can see two possible
explanations for it.

782
00:32:02,103 --> 00:32:04,371
Either I'm even more
feebleminded

783
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:06,780
than you ever realized

784
00:32:06,816 --> 00:32:10,690
or you're not as smart
as you think you are.

785
00:32:21,888 --> 00:32:23,859
Good, good, stop.

786
00:32:23,893 --> 00:32:25,021
One more!

787
00:32:25,063 --> 00:32:26,498
Dabo!

788
00:32:28,506 --> 00:32:30,032
Looks like your lucky day.

789
00:32:30,076 --> 00:32:31,045
Please.

790
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:32,048
You and I both know

791
00:32:32,081 --> 00:32:34,018
these games of chance
are no such thing...

792
00:32:34,053 --> 00:32:35,956
the odds are
in the house's favor.

793
00:32:35,992 --> 00:32:37,291
Shh. Don't say that.

794
00:32:37,329 --> 00:32:38,798
People are trying to have fun.

795
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:41,863
Sooner or later, no matter
how perfectly I play

796
00:32:41,907 --> 00:32:44,106
no matter how well
I hedge my bets

797
00:32:44,146 --> 00:32:45,308
I'm going to lose.

798
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:48,654
Why are you trying to spoil
everyone's good time?

799
00:32:48,691 --> 00:32:49,660
Look around.

800
00:32:49,693 --> 00:32:52,325
These people are
enjoying themselves.

801
00:32:52,368 --> 00:32:54,168
Half of them know the
odds are against them

802
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:55,334
but they don't care.

803
00:32:55,376 --> 00:32:57,176
They're here because they want
to believe they can win.

804
00:32:57,213 --> 00:32:58,182
Is that so bad?

805
00:32:58,216 --> 00:32:59,242
They're fools.

806
00:32:59,286 --> 00:33:01,520
Why don't you just
take your winnings

807
00:33:01,558 --> 00:33:03,118
and call it a day?

808
00:33:03,162 --> 00:33:05,691
Because I'm trying
to prove a point.

809
00:33:05,735 --> 00:33:08,207
There is no way to win.

810
00:33:08,242 --> 00:33:10,213
Stop saying that.

811
00:33:10,247 --> 00:33:12,981
There! You see?

812
00:33:13,021 --> 00:33:15,459
We're all as good as dead.

813
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,796
Doctor... take it easy.

814
00:33:17,833 --> 00:33:19,200
It's just a game.

815
00:33:19,237 --> 00:33:20,501
You're right.

816
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:23,606
It's not as if 900 billion lives
were at stake.

817
00:33:30,764 --> 00:33:31,824
I just got word.

818
00:33:31,867 --> 00:33:33,735
Starfleet rejected
our recommendations.

819
00:33:33,772 --> 00:33:34,741
I knew it!

820
00:33:34,774 --> 00:33:36,745
It's kind of a relief
in a way.

821
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,410
I mean, who wants
to wave a white flag?

822
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,419
They're the cowards.

823
00:33:39,453 --> 00:33:41,185
They don't have the courage
to see the truth.

824
00:33:41,225 --> 00:33:42,194
You may be right

825
00:33:42,227 --> 00:33:43,526
but there's nothing we can do.

826
00:33:43,565 --> 00:33:45,593
No, no, no, we can't
just take this lying down.

827
00:33:45,636 --> 00:33:46,627
The stakes are too high.

828
00:33:46,672 --> 00:33:48,232
We've got to take matters
into our own hands.

829
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,940
How, Jack?
What can we do?

830
00:33:51,218 --> 00:33:53,816
We can't force
Starfleet to surrender.

831
00:33:53,857 --> 00:33:55,053
If we can't head off the war

832
00:33:55,094 --> 00:33:56,792
then there might be a way
to make it a lot less bloody.

833
00:33:56,832 --> 00:33:57,892
How?

834
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:00,065
Look at this...

835
00:34:00,107 --> 00:34:02,078
Starfleet battle plans,
uh, fleet deployments.

836
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:04,812
Do you know what the Dominion
could do with this information?

837
00:34:04,853 --> 00:34:07,691
They could take the Alpha
Quadrant in a matter of weeks.

838
00:34:07,727 --> 00:34:08,855
With a lot fewer
Federation casualties

839
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:09,862
than in a drawn-out war.

840
00:34:09,966 --> 00:34:11,196
There wouldn't be more than

841
00:34:11,236 --> 00:34:12,296
two billion casualties.

842
00:34:12,338 --> 00:34:14,206
That's a lot better
than 900 billion.

843
00:34:15,413 --> 00:34:18,215
Wait a minute!

844
00:34:18,254 --> 00:34:20,556
It's one thing for us
to try and avert a war

845
00:34:20,594 --> 00:34:22,896
but it's quite another
for us to take it on ourselves

846
00:34:22,932 --> 00:34:23,901
to trigger an invasion

847
00:34:23,935 --> 00:34:25,565
that's going to get
a lot of people killed.

848
00:34:25,607 --> 00:34:27,771
It's not our place to decide
who lives and who dies.

849
00:34:27,812 --> 00:34:28,906
We're not gods.

850
00:34:28,948 --> 00:34:31,182
Maybe not, but we're
the next best thing.

851
00:34:31,221 --> 00:34:32,953
Can you hear yourself?

852
00:34:34,028 --> 00:34:35,463
That's precisely
the kind of thinking

853
00:34:35,498 --> 00:34:36,694
that makes people afraid of us.

854
00:34:36,735 --> 00:34:37,726
I don't care.

855
00:34:37,771 --> 00:34:39,401
I'm willing to make
this decision.

856
00:34:39,443 --> 00:34:41,038
It's not our decision
to make.

857
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,948
We presented our case
to Starfleet.

858
00:34:43,052 --> 00:34:44,784
They rejected it.
Case closed.

859
00:34:44,823 --> 00:34:45,792
Not closed!

860
00:34:45,826 --> 00:34:47,421
We're going through with this.

861
00:34:47,464 --> 00:34:49,902
Well, I'm not going to be
a party to treason.

862
00:34:49,937 --> 00:34:52,273
Call it what you want,
but I am willing to do it

863
00:34:52,309 --> 00:34:54,577
if it means saving
billions of lives, hm, hm.

864
00:34:56,387 --> 00:34:57,982
So are you with us? Hm, hm?

865
00:34:58,023 --> 00:35:00,929
No! Haven't you been listening?

866
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:02,731
Fine!

867
00:35:07,114 --> 00:35:08,174
Mmm...

868
00:35:10,891 --> 00:35:13,329
So how do we contact
the Dominion?

869
00:35:26,866 --> 00:35:29,100
Still at it, I see.

870
00:35:29,138 --> 00:35:32,875
I've been looking over
Sisko's latest counterproposal.

871
00:35:32,914 --> 00:35:35,512
We don't seem to be
getting anywhere with him.

872
00:35:35,554 --> 00:35:37,525
Not very encouraging,
is it?

873
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,360
I don't know why you had me

874
00:35:39,398 --> 00:35:41,893
call for peace talks
in the first place.

875
00:35:41,938 --> 00:35:46,906
My, my. How quickly
you've taken to your new role.

876
00:35:46,951 --> 00:35:49,185
And to think,
only a short time ago

877
00:35:49,223 --> 00:35:51,821
you were nothing more
than Gul Dukat's Adjutant.

878
00:35:51,863 --> 00:35:55,327
I appreciate the faith
you've shown in me.

879
00:35:55,373 --> 00:35:57,537
Then show some faith in me.

880
00:35:57,579 --> 00:36:01,750
Don't be like your predecessor,
second-guessing my every move.

881
00:36:01,789 --> 00:36:05,526
It should be clear to you by now
that no one is irreplaceable.

882
00:36:06,937 --> 00:36:08,031
Now...

883
00:36:08,105 --> 00:36:12,914
I just received
a very interesting message

884
00:36:12,952 --> 00:36:15,048
from an unidentified party

885
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:16,925
claiming to have
some information

886
00:36:16,963 --> 00:36:19,059
that could be
very beneficial to us.

887
00:36:19,101 --> 00:36:20,627
What sort of information?

888
00:36:20,672 --> 00:36:21,936
I don't know

889
00:36:21,976 --> 00:36:24,950
but we're going to find out.

890
00:36:33,973 --> 00:36:35,967
Computer...

891
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:40,014
Computer, respond.

892
00:36:44,701 --> 00:36:46,695
Sarina, where is everyone?

893
00:36:48,577 --> 00:36:51,311
Did they arrange a meeting
with the Dominion?

894
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,129
Listen, we have to stop them
before it's too late.

895
00:36:59,172 --> 00:37:00,505
Untie me.

896
00:37:02,346 --> 00:37:04,750
Please, Sarina.

897
00:37:06,156 --> 00:37:10,098
You don't want the deaths
of so many people on your hands.

898
00:37:10,134 --> 00:37:12,972
It's Jack, isn't it?

899
00:37:13,007 --> 00:37:14,499
Are you worried
what he'll think?

900
00:37:14,545 --> 00:37:16,037
I've seen the way
you look at him

901
00:37:16,082 --> 00:37:18,316
when you think
no one's watching.

902
00:37:18,355 --> 00:37:20,691
I know how much you care

903
00:37:20,727 --> 00:37:22,891
but if you don't help me
stop them

904
00:37:22,933 --> 00:37:26,374
you know what's going to happen?

905
00:37:26,409 --> 00:37:30,181
They're going to be arrested
and charged with treason

906
00:37:30,286 --> 00:37:33,419
and you're never going to see
any of them again.

907
00:37:33,461 --> 00:37:35,625
You're never going to see
Jack again.

908
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,088
I'm Patrick.

909
00:37:44,122 --> 00:37:45,421
Patrick!

910
00:37:45,458 --> 00:37:46,620
Come on.

911
00:37:56,621 --> 00:37:58,387
Hello, everyone.

912
00:37:58,426 --> 00:38:00,056
He's not supposed to be here.

913
00:38:00,096 --> 00:38:01,896
No, no, no, he's not.

914
00:38:01,934 --> 00:38:03,494
I-I don't understand.

915
00:38:03,539 --> 00:38:05,339
Well, why don't we all go back
to your quarters

916
00:38:05,377 --> 00:38:07,747
and I will explain it to you.

917
00:38:07,783 --> 00:38:09,413
No. We've got to do this.

918
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:10,787
Lives are at stake.

919
00:38:10,824 --> 00:38:12,350
Don't interfere, Julian.

920
00:38:12,395 --> 00:38:14,025
You have no right.

921
00:38:14,066 --> 00:38:16,196
You're in enough trouble
already, Jack.

922
00:38:16,238 --> 00:38:17,798
Don't make it any worse.

923
00:38:17,843 --> 00:38:21,444
Now, we can do this
the easy way...

924
00:38:21,485 --> 00:38:23,753
or the hard way.

925
00:38:23,791 --> 00:38:25,785
It's up to you.

926
00:38:28,202 --> 00:38:29,637
Where are they?

927
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:30,802
They'll be here.

928
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:32,141
This is ridiculous.

929
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,812
Sneaking into a storage bay
for a secret meeting.

930
00:38:34,853 --> 00:38:36,949
I'm not some agent
of the Obsidian Order.

931
00:38:36,992 --> 00:38:38,622
I'm the leader
of the Cardassian Empire.

932
00:38:38,663 --> 00:38:40,132
Don't let it go to your head.

933
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:42,138
You serve only at the
Dominion's pleasure.

934
00:38:42,173 --> 00:38:44,303
Besides, I think it's exciting.

935
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:46,875
They're here.

936
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:52,897
Odo?

937
00:38:52,934 --> 00:38:55,030
Yes, I know.

938
00:38:55,072 --> 00:38:57,704
I honor you with my presence.

939
00:38:57,746 --> 00:39:00,982
We... seem to have
gotten ourselves lost.

940
00:39:01,022 --> 00:39:02,082
Mm-hmm.

941
00:39:02,124 --> 00:39:03,992
They're not coming.

942
00:39:05,198 --> 00:39:06,497
Who's not coming?

943
00:39:07,605 --> 00:39:10,511
I had a feeling
you were going to say that.

944
00:39:10,546 --> 00:39:13,452
Shall I escort you
to your quarters?

945
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:21,613
Captain Sisko has decided
not to press charges.

946
00:39:21,656 --> 00:39:23,182
You won't be going to prison.

947
00:39:23,226 --> 00:39:24,661
What are they going to do
to us?

948
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:25,892
Nothing bad.

949
00:39:25,933 --> 00:39:27,699
You'll be going back
to the Institute together.

950
00:39:27,738 --> 00:39:29,606
It doesn't matter
what happens to us.

951
00:39:29,643 --> 00:39:31,409
Don't you realize
what you've done, hm?

952
00:39:31,447 --> 00:39:33,509
I've kept you
from committing treason.

953
00:39:33,553 --> 00:39:35,285
Are we supposed to thank you?

954
00:39:35,324 --> 00:39:37,488
900 billion people
are going to die.

955
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:38,726
You don't know that.

956
00:39:38,767 --> 00:39:39,827
Didn't you sit here

957
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:41,169
and go through the
projections with us?

958
00:39:41,206 --> 00:39:42,175
Hm, hm, hm? Didn't you?

959
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:43,336
He was here, Jack.

960
00:39:43,378 --> 00:39:44,506
I remember.

961
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,348
Maybe our projections
were wrong.

962
00:39:46,386 --> 00:39:47,685
How can you say that?

963
00:39:47,723 --> 00:39:49,523
We factored in
every contingency, hm.

964
00:39:49,561 --> 00:39:50,530
Every variable.

965
00:39:50,564 --> 00:39:51,999
The equations don't lie.

966
00:39:52,068 --> 00:39:53,560
You! You.

967
00:39:53,605 --> 00:39:54,801
You ruined everything.

968
00:39:54,842 --> 00:39:56,540
What do you make of that, Jack?

969
00:39:56,579 --> 00:39:58,550
Why didn't you anticipate that?

970
00:39:58,585 --> 00:40:01,217
Why didn't you factor
her into your equation?

971
00:40:01,258 --> 00:40:04,232
Because you thought
you knew everything

972
00:40:04,266 --> 00:40:06,032
but you didn't even know

973
00:40:06,105 --> 00:40:08,577
what was going to happen
in this room.

974
00:40:08,611 --> 00:40:11,779
One person derailed your plans.

975
00:40:14,459 --> 00:40:19,028
One person changed
the course of history.

976
00:40:19,071 --> 00:40:22,604
Now, I don't know about you

977
00:40:22,647 --> 00:40:27,922
but that makes me think
that maybe, just maybe

978
00:40:27,961 --> 00:40:30,729
things may not turn out
the way we thought.

979
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:51,952
I heard what happened.

980
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,790
It was a pretty close call.

981
00:40:53,828 --> 00:40:56,630
Yeah. Luckily, I managed
to intercept them in time.

982
00:40:56,668 --> 00:40:57,898
No, that's not what I meant.

983
00:40:57,938 --> 00:41:00,342
I was talking about
when you had to decide

984
00:41:00,378 --> 00:41:02,212
whether or not
to meet with the Dominion.

985
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:05,315
It can't have been
easy for you.

986
00:41:05,358 --> 00:41:08,822
I know how you wanted to try to
save as many lives as possible.

987
00:41:08,867 --> 00:41:11,499
That's probably what makes you
such a good doctor.

988
00:41:11,541 --> 00:41:16,851
Fortunately, this doctor
is also a Starfleet Officer.

989
00:41:16,888 --> 00:41:19,156
We thought we were so smart.

990
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:22,668
We thought we could predict
the future.

991
00:41:22,703 --> 00:41:24,640
It was my fault

992
00:41:24,675 --> 00:41:26,839
not theirs.

993
00:41:26,881 --> 00:41:29,410
I should never have let things
go so far.

994
00:41:31,091 --> 00:41:34,190
If I hadn't been so bent on
trying to prove to the world

995
00:41:34,266 --> 00:41:36,396
that they had something
to contribute...

996
00:41:36,439 --> 00:41:37,738
They did contribute.

997
00:41:37,775 --> 00:41:40,407
It seems to me we've become
far too complacent

998
00:41:40,449 --> 00:41:42,079
about the Dominion.

999
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:45,219
We may have driven them back
into Cardassian space

1000
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:47,232
but we haven't beaten them yet.

1001
00:41:47,266 --> 00:41:49,362
I can only hope.

1002
00:41:50,676 --> 00:41:53,114
Well, the odds
are stacked against us.

1003
00:41:53,149 --> 00:41:55,678
All we can do
is give it our best shot.

1004
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:12,058
You're not going to cause
any more trouble, are you?

1005
00:42:12,098 --> 00:42:13,658
Not this time.

1006
00:42:13,702 --> 00:42:15,035
I'll double-down.

1007
00:42:15,073 --> 00:42:16,873
Risky.

1008
00:42:16,911 --> 00:42:18,437
Maybe there's a better bet

1009
00:42:18,481 --> 00:42:21,580
but sometimes when the odds
are so stacked against you

1010
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,650
you've just got
to take a chance.

1011
00:42:23,694 --> 00:42:25,186
I admire your courage.

1012
00:42:25,232 --> 00:42:28,172
Dabo!

1013
00:42:28,207 --> 00:42:30,041
Well, what do you know?

1014
00:42:30,078 --> 00:42:31,570
We have a winner.

1015
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:33,814
O'Brien to Bashir.

1016
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,290
Go ahead.

1017
00:42:35,325 --> 00:42:38,163
You wanted to know when
a certain transport was leaving.

1018
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:40,033
Oh, thanks.

1019
00:42:40,071 --> 00:42:42,566
There is one problem, though.

1020
00:42:42,611 --> 00:42:45,049
We've got some passengers
that are refusing to board

1021
00:42:45,084 --> 00:42:46,850
unless you come see them.

1022
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:52,162
I didn't think
you'd want to see me again.

1023
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:53,330
Believe me

1024
00:42:53,372 --> 00:42:54,898
I wouldn't mind
if our predictions

1025
00:42:54,942 --> 00:42:55,933
turned out to be wrong.

1026
00:42:57,215 --> 00:42:59,345
Jack's still furious, but...

1027
00:42:59,387 --> 00:43:01,723
I didn't want to leave
without saying good-bye.

1028
00:43:03,966 --> 00:43:05,994
Will you come visit us?

1029
00:43:06,038 --> 00:43:07,507
What?

1030
00:43:07,541 --> 00:43:10,309
Oh, uh, yeah, I'd like that.

1031
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:15,928
You did the right thing,
you know.

1032
00:43:18,237 --> 00:43:21,336
One of these days,
he'll understand that.

1033
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:28,224
So... you ready to go?

1034
00:43:28,263 --> 00:43:29,562
Not so fast.

1035
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,935
There's one thing
I need to know, Doctor.

1036
00:43:31,971 --> 00:43:35,913
If-if we can come up with a way
to beat the Dominion

1037
00:43:35,949 --> 00:43:37,852
will you listen?

1038
00:43:37,887 --> 00:43:39,881
I can't think of anything
I'd like better.

1039
00:43:41,129 --> 00:43:42,223
Good.

1040
00:43:42,265 --> 00:43:43,791
Good, good, all right,
let's go then.

1041
00:43:43,835 --> 00:43:44,929
Let's go.

1042
00:43:44,972 --> 00:43:47,068
Bashir to O'Brien.

1043
00:43:47,111 --> 00:43:49,275
Four to beam out.
