00:00:01,251 --> 00:00:03,211
VIC:
Sure, I remember
<i>The Alamo.</i>

2
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:04,546
See? I told you he would.

3
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:05,923
Laurence Harvey, Richard Widmark

4
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:07,800
and John Wayne
as Davy Crockett.

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,678
Great battle scenes,
nice sets, but way too long.

6
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:12,513
We're not talking
about a movie.

7
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:14,640
No, we're, we're talking
about our holosuite program.

8
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,725
Oh, that Alamo.
What about it?

9
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,769
Well, we've got
Holosuite 4 booked for an hour

10
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,688
and were wondering
whether you'd like to join us?

11
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:23,899
Look, fellas, I'm touched by
the offer, but I don't know.

12
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,568
Well, we can transfer
your matrix to
the Alamo program.

13
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,445
You've got to leave
Vegas sometimes, right?

14
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,823
Oh, true, but I'm afraid
I have to say no.

15
00:00:30,823 --> 00:00:32,073
Why?

16
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:33,659
I don't look good in buckskin.

Tell you what I'll do, though.

19
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:37,955
How about a little tune

20
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:39,999
to get you
into a Texas state of mind?

21
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:44,211

Frankie Eyes.

What are you doing in Vegas?

00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,294

This gentleman
a friend of yours?

56
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,101
We know each other.

57
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:24,519
We're a long way from South
Philly, ain't we, Vic?

58
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:27,606
So, are you here on business
or pleasure?

59
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:29,483
Let's just say I'm here to stay

60
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:32,319
while you, Vicky-boy,
are about to take a powder.

61
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,529
I'm not going anywhere.

62
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:35,864
I got news
for you, pal

63
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:36,949
I just bought
this hotel.

64
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:38,492
You're history.

65
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,535
You can't fire me.
I have a contract.

66
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:42,329
And you can paper your walls
with it.

67
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,247
You're finished
in this town, Vic.

68
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,457
You're blackballing me?

69
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,084
As of this moment

70
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:49,210
you couldn't get a job
as a singing busboy.

71
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,421
Now, are you going
to walk out of here

72
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,632
or do you have
to be carried out?

73
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:54,925
Makes no difference to me.

74
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,802
Let me handle this.

75
00:02:56,802 --> 00:03:00,263
Computer, delete characters

76
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,265
Frankie Eyes
and, uh-- I'm sorry

77
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,642
I didn't catch
your name.

78
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:04,601
Cicci.

79
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,145
Cicci!

80
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:08,981
Cicci from the
holosuite's program.

81
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:10,941
What's a holosuites?

82
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,734
Beats me.

83
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,945
They're still
here, Chief.

84
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:17,196
Computer, freeze program.

85
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,203
There must be a little
problem in the character

86
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:25,372
deletion
algorithm...

87
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,581
I'll show you the door.

88
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,667
Make that a big problem.

89
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,327
So, what's it going
to be, pally?

90
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,954
I guess I start packing.

91
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,205
Smart boy.

92
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:31,414
All right, Cicci, come on.

93
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,292
Let's check out my casino.

94
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,925
So, what do we do now?

95
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,260
Nothing we can do.

96
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:47,014
Frankie's a made
man,<i> capisce?</i>

97
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,765
No, I'm not talking
about Frankie.

98
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,892
I'm talking about fixing
the entire program.

99
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:54,188
Well, we could shut it down
manually and reset it

100
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,315
but that would wipe
Vic's memory.

101
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:59,318
He'd forget everything
that's happened
since we activated him.

102
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:01,402
Oh, hold on, pally.
Nobody's wiping my memory.

103
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:02,946
Of course not.

104
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,781
But there must be
some other way.

105
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,033
I wish I knew
what it was.

106
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,993
I better
talk to Felix.

107
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:09,494
After all, he was the one
who designed this program.

108
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,578
You do that.

109
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,122
In the meantime

110
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,249
you stay out of the way
of Frankie Eyes.

111
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:16,293
You'll get no argument from me.

112
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,547
I'll tell you one thing.

113
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,549
If this Frankie Eyes
hurts Vic in any way

114
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,718
he's going to have
to answer to me.

115
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,385
I do not understand

116
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:29,056
how you could feel
such loyalty for a hologram.

117
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,099
He's not just a hologram.

118
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,391
He's my friend.

119
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,144
Don't you like Vic?

120
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,104
As a singer, I find him...

121
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,065
entertaining.

122
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,192
But beyond that, I neither
like him nor dislike him.

123
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:41,693
He is a hologram

124
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,695
and therefore,
he does not exist.

125
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,197
He does for me.

126
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:47,115
I just talked to Felix.

127
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,701
I know what's been affecting
Vic's program.

128
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,036
It's a jack-in-the-box.

129
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,079
A what?

130
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,330
A jack-in-the-box.

131
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,249
It's a children's toy on Earth.

132
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,000
You wind it up and a figure
pops out and goes "boo."

133
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,168
Except this kind
of jack-in-the-box is different.

134
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,211
It doesn't
go "boo."

135
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:00,419
No.

136
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,130
This surprise is buried deep

137
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,757
in the holosuite program.

138
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,259
It's meant to shake things up

139
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,593
you know--
make things interesting.

140
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,345
I wasn't bored, were you?

141
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:09,637
Not at all.

142
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,639
I liked Vic's the way it was.

143
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,474
Well, according to Felix,
if we get rid of Frankie Eyes

144
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:15,476
everything resets
back to the way it was.

145
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,187
Well, that's good to know.

146
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:18,563
So, how<i> do</i> we get rid
of Frankie Eyes?

147
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,440
BASHIR:
Now, that's up to us.

148
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,650
But Felix did warn me
the program is period specific.

149
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,444
In other words,
if we shoot him

150
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,571
we have to use a .45 automatic
and not a phaser.

151
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,156
We can't shoot Frankie.
It's too dangerous.

152
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,699
The mob could retaliate
against Vic.

153
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,451
If anything happens
to Vic, his matrix

154
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,203
will be eliminated from
the program, permanently.

155
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,789
The news just keeps getting
better, doesn't it?

156
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:36,790
What news?

157
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,625
Oh, nothing, sir.

158
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,627
We're, uh, talking
about a holosuite program.

159
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,212
BASHIR:
Vic Fontaine's hotel

160
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,381
has just been bought by...
gangsters.

161
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:45,924
I see.

162
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:47,550
When do you plan
on going back to work?

163
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,137
Right away, sir.

164
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,106
Whatever you
decide to do, Chief

165
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:02,149
count me in.

166
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,317
I owe Vic.

167
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:04,776
I thought losing my leg

168
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,153
was the end
of my Starfleet career.

169
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:07,695
He taught me
otherwise.

170
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:08,905
KIRA:
He changed
my life, too...

171
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,198
and Odo's.

172
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,408
Now...

173
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,743
all we need's a plan.

174
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,669
Mmm.
Your daddy would be proud.

175
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,046
My daddy taught me
everything I know.

176
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,381
How nice.

177
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,800
So, how was your day?

178
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,219
It's getting better.

179
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,971
Did something happen?

180
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,806
It's Vic.

181
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:35,807
Vic?

182
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,100
Vic Fontaine.

183
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,726
A gangster
named Frankie Eyes

184
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:39,978
took over his lounge.

185
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,562
The whole place has changed

186
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,231
and no one's sure
how to change it back.

187
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:47,527
What?

188
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,488
Nothing.

189
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:52,657
I guess this sounds
pretty silly to you.

190
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,117
A little.

191
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,119
You have to understand

192
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,413
Vic isn't just another
holosuite program.

193
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:00,623
He's more like a friend.

194
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,668
Kasidy, can we talk
about something else?

195
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,920
Sure.

196
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:09,716
How come you've
never been to Vic's?

197
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,134
Does it matter?

198
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,552
You like going there,
and I don't.

199
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,012
Let's leave it at that.

200
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,263
I was only asking.

201
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,432
And I gave you my answer.

202
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:22,979
There are times when I
just can't figure you out.

203
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:26,941
Well... maybe that's part
of the attraction.

204
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,278
Believe that if you want to.

205
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,202
VIC:
Who is it?

206
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,578
It's Miles and Julian.

207
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,621
Just a minute.

208

Hey, pally.

Whose side are you on?

213
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,642
I'm sorry, but you've got
three bruised ribs here

214
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,686
and your left wrist
is sprained.

215
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,230
But the good news is

216
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,232
your skull
is still in one piece.

217
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,358
Thanks.

218
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:09,817
I feel better already.

219
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,445
That jack-in-the-box.

220
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,405
I can't believe Felix
would do that to me.

221
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:15,031
Oh, don't take it
personally, Vic.

222
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,533
He was just trying
to do me a favor

223
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:17,867
by not letting things
get too boring.

224
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,702
I thought that
was my job.

225
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,329
Oh, and you're
great at it.

226
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,872
You know,
we love you.

227
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,999
So, you gonna tell us
what happened?

228
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,793
I slipped in the bathtub.

229
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,336
Oh, yeah... and you
knocked over this furniture

230
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,504
looking for a bandage, right?

231
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:32,048
Something like that.

232
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,342
Frankie sent Tony Cicci
to pay me a little visit.

233
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:38,138
He wanted to remind me not
to take too long packing.

234
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,140
What is it with you and Frankie?

235
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,601
It goes back to the
old neighborhood
when we were kids.

236
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:45,019
I used to beat him
at stickball.

237
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,020
And?

238
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,522
And...

239
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:50,024
Nothing. We've been
rivals ever since.

240
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,943
That Felix, huh?

241
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:55,822
When he designs a holosuite
program, he doesn't fool around.

242
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,365
Huh. Tell me about it.

243
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,658
Now, you should
get some rest.

244
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,368
Maybe take a
little vacation.

245
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,702
A vacation?

246
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,246
Did you guys take
a vacation

247
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:05,206
when the Dominion
took over DS9?

248
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,749
It's not the same thing.

249
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:07,959
It is to me.

250
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,544
This is my life, remember?

251
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:11,338
I don't run at the
first sign of trouble.

252
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,298
We're not asking you
to run anywhere.

00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,511
What plan?

256
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,053
How to get rid of Frankie Eyes.

257
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,930
Odo and Kira are in
the lounge right now.

258

Doing what?

259
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,766
Checking up on Frankie.

260
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,852
We need to find his weak spot.

261
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,439
I hope you know what
you're getting me into.

262

paid for it.

for my friend here.

335
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:58,648
Turns out Frankie Eyes
was sent to Vegas

336
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:01,317
by a man named
Carl Zeemo.

337
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:05,196
Huh. Looks like Frankie's
moving up in the world.

338
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,407
You know
Mr. Zeemo?

339
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,908
Been around forever.

340
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,951
Likes to pretend
he's a sweet old man

341
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:14,080
but he's meaner
than a junkyard dog.

342
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,833
This is all starting
to make sense.

343
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,711
I knew Frankie didn't have
the money to buy a hotel.

344
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:20,837
But Zeemo does.

345
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,714
More than
enough.

346
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,924
This is going to be
a pretty sweet deal for him.

347
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:28,386
The casino's bringing in
about a million bucks a month--

348
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:29,929
cash--

349
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,640
and out of that,
Zeemo expects to be sent

350
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,017
a couple hundred grand.

351
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,562
That would be the "skim."

00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:40,022
Right off the top.
Tax free.

353
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,733
Frankie's got nothing
to worry about.

is send Mr. Zeemo his cut.

00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,454
What would happen to Frankie

361
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:57,498
if, uh, he didn't
give Zeemo his "skim"?

362
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,999
(<i> chuckles</i> )

363
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,085
No, Frankie's not that dumb.

364
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:04,004
Miles, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

365
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,799
Well, it depends
on what you're thinking.

366
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:08,134
All we have to do
is see to it that Mr. Zeemo

367
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,219
doesn't see a penny
of that money.

368
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,722
Are you talking
about robbing the casino?

369
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,348
That's what I was thinking.

370
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,934
Isn't it
dangerous?

371
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:18,937
Stealing from the mob?
You bet it is.

372
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:21,731
<i>You</i> get caught,
and I kiss the world good-bye.

373
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,733
Well, then the trick is
not to get caught.

374
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,694
You guys are nuts,
you know that?

375
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:29,697
Besides, the money's
kept in a safe.

376
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,157
What kind of safe?

377
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,117
I don't know-- it's
in the count room.

378
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:36,412
And there's a guard
outside the door 24 hours a day.

379
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,956
And even if you did get past him

380
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:40,082
there's still
that little problem

381
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,668
of the two count men inside.

382
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,336
I'll get a look at the safe.

383
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,630
We'll figure out
a way to take
out the guard.

384
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,131
And the count men.

385
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,466
And anything else
that comes along.

386
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:49,634
Then we're agreed?

387
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:50,677
BASHIR:
Absolutely.

388
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,094
I'm in.
Me, too.

389
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,220
Sure.

390
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,305
Okay.

391
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:55,807
Let's do it!

392
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,391
Wait a minute.

393
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,935
Let me get this straight.

394
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:01,061
You're going
to knock over the casino

395
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,857
and swipe a cool million
from the mob?

396
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,316
Vic...

397
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:08,277
you want your lounge back
or not?

398
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:12,949
Deal me in.

399
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,587
Have you ever seen
a prettier shade of green?

400
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,048
Looks like you had
a profitable night.

401
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,801
And the night's not over.

402
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,095
Is that for me
or, uh...

403
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,433
am I just keeping
it warm for you?

404
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,185
It's all yours, baby

405
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,729
and there's more
where that came from.

406
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:45,648
I'll, uh, take
your word for it.

407
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,107
What are you looking at?!

408
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,192
Nothing.

409
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,861
Just keep counting.

410
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,448
After you, sweetheart.

411
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:11,382
Are you sure you didn't
go to high school in Asheville

412
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:12,717
North Carolina?

413
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,301
Yeah. I'm positive.

414
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:16,178
That's funny.

415
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,932
You look just like the captain
of our football team.

416
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,683
I had such a crush on him.

417
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:26,105
Well, um, actually, I, um...

418
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,314
I did play a little football.

419
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:28,608
I knew it.

420
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,317
You have the body of an athlete.

421
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:36,741
You call this a cheese-steak?

422
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:38,325
Hmm?

423
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,870
I wouldn't feed this
to my parole officer.

424
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,246
Excuse me,
uh, Cicci...

425
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,414
uh, could I have
a word with you?

426
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,249
Just a second, please.

427
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,627
Now, I want
a real cheese-steak

428
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,336
and I don't care

429
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,338
if you gotta fly to
Philadelphia to get it.

430
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,511
A guy could starve to death
in this town.

431
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,179
Ezri...

432
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,431
this is
Tony Cicci.

433
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:01,599
Nice to meet you.

434
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:03,350
Oh...

435
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,519
pleasure's all mine.

436
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,229
Ezri's new
in town.

437
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,440
She needs a job.

438
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,317
I'm a very good waitress.

439
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,902
Aah...
you wouldn't happen to have

440
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:15,321
a slice of pizza
on you, would you?

441
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,615
No, but... I could go
to the kitchen and get you one.

442
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:20,200
Aah! That chef wouldn't
know a good pizza

443
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,410
if it hit him right in the face.

444
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,917
Consider yourself
gainfully employed.

445
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,251
Really?

446
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,004
That's wonderful.

447
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,421
Thanks, Cicci.
I owe you one.

448
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,923
Ah, don't mention it, Stretch.

449
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,633
Maybe one of these days,
you'll show me

450
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:36,884
that, uh...

451
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:42,181
I don't believe it.

452
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,892
Take it--
Take it easy, pally.

453
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,144
Take it easy!

454
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:47,269
I'm not looking for trouble.

455
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,395
Well, that's a relief.

456
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,064
I'm here to see Frankie.

457
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,108
I want to try to work
things out with him.

458
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:54,401
You know, let
bygones be bygones.

459
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,281
VIC:
Frankie, I'm dying here.

460
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,450
The Sands, the Dunes, the D.I.--

461
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,077
no one will even return my call.

462
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:05,204
Tell me something
I don't know.

463
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,248
There's got to be a way for us
to bury the hatchet.

464
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,001
I already did...

465
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:11,544
in your head.

466
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:14,296
Frankie, you want me
to beg, I'll beg.

467
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,632
Give me a chance
to make things right.

468
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,218
I know people-- people
with dough, high rollers.

469
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,260
I could bring them

470
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,013
into the
casino.

471
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:23,597
What?

472
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,599
You want to be my shill?

473
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,351
I'm talking
about people

474
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,062
who can drop ten, 20,
30 big ones a night.

475
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:30,646
Give him what he
wants, Frankie.

476
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,815
I can't take much
more of his whining.

477
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,484
Bring in a couple
of players...

478
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,819
then we'll talk.

479
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:38,278
That's all I ask.

480
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,114
Let me buy you a drink.

481
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:42,282
I don't drink
with losers.

482
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:44,326
Come on, dollface...

483
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:47,747
let's, uh, warm up
the poker table.

484
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:54,670
Welcome back.

485
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,842
You're in charge of what?

486
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,635
Of distracting
the guard

487
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,470
so that we can sneak someone
into the count room.

488
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,681
Kasidy, I can't believe
you're involved in this thing.

489
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,516
The whole thing
is ridiculous.

490
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,560
I guess that means you're
not going to wish me luck.

491
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,020
And you're telling me

492
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,479
that virtually
my entire senior staff

493
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,232
is a part of this nonsense.

494
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:15,983
You're supposed to
help your friends

495
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,568
when they're in trouble

496
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,403
and Vic, hologram or
not, is in trouble.

497
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,988
Not that I expect
you to care.

498
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,865
Look, this is not
about Vic Fontaine.

499
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:24,450
Then what is
your problem?

500
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,077
You want to know?

501
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:28,704
You really want to know
what my problem is?

502
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,831
I'll tell you:
Las Vegas, 1962.

503
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,666
That's my problem.

504
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,502
In 1962, black people
weren't very welcome there.

505
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,922
Oh, sure, they could be
performers or janitors

506
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:39,548
but customers--<i> never.</i>

507
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,675
Maybe that's the way
it was in the real Vegas

508
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,886
but that is not
the way it is at Vic's.

509
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:46,180
I have never
felt uncomfortable there

510
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,848
and neither has Jake.

511
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:48,891
But don't you see?

512
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:50,350
That's the lie.

513
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,478
In 1962,
the Civil Rights Movement

514
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:53,980
was still in its infancy.

515
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,731
It wasn't an easy time
for our people

516
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,858
and I'm not going
to pretend that it was.

517
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:00,153
Baby...

518
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:02,989
I know that Vic's

519
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:05,283
isn't a totally accurate
representation

520
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:09,411
of the way things were,
but it isn't meant to be.

521
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,539
It shows us the way
things<i> could</i> have been.

522
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,333
The way they
<i>should</i> have been.

523
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,794
We cannot ignore
the truth about the past.

524
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:19,713
Going to Vic's isn't
going to make us forget

525
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,841
who we are or
where we came from.

526
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,676
What it does is reminds us

527
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:27,721
that we are no longer bound
by any limitations...

528
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:30,557
except the ones we
impose on ourselves.

529
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,611
What about Worf?

530
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,280
KIRA:
Oh, he'll never agree to it.

531
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,032
There's
always Quark.

532
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:47,992
I'm not sure
he'd help.

533
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:50,368
He thinks of you
as his competition.

534
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,369
(<i> knocking at door</i> )

535
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:52,997
I'll get it.

536
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:55,041
Better get this
out of sight.

537
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:01,088
EZRI:
There's one
little problem.

538
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,548
We're still
one man short.

539
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:03,841
BASHIR:
We need a high roller

540
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:05,176
with Vic
at the craps table.

541
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:06,719
Someone to gather
a crowd

542
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,012
keep attention away
from the count room.

543
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:09,972
Otherwise,
the whole plan

544
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:11,057
falls apart.

545
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:12,141
And we certainly can't

546
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:13,893
let that happen.

547
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,269
Now...

548
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:17,813
exactly what do you
need me to do?

549
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:22,818
Let's go over it
one more time.

550
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,486
Do we have to?

551
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,780
Everyone knows
what they have to do, right?

552
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,532
It's all pretty
simple, really.

553
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,326
Hey, far be it from me

554
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:33,204
to tell Starfleet officers
how to do their jobs.

555
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:34,538
Well, robbing casinos

556
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,956
isn't part of
any Starfleet

557
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:38,209
job description I've ever read.

558
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:39,960
We can't afford
to make any mistakes.

559
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,419
And we're not going to.

560
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:42,922
Take us through it again.

561
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:45,007
You got it, pally.

562
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:50,012
It all begins with you

563
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:52,056
<i>keeping Frankie Eyes</i>
<i>away from the casino</i>

564
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:53,266
<i>and the count room.</i>

565
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,942
<i>Meanwhile, the Captain and I</i>

566

<i>will be laying down</i>
<i>some heavy bread</i>

567
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:07,529
<i>over at the craps table--</i>
<i>enough to draw a crowd.</i>

568
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:10,032
SISKO:
<i>Where are we going to get</i>
<i>that kind of money?</i>

569
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:13,451
VIC:
<i>I put a little away</i>
<i>for a rainy day.</i>

570
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:17,081
<i>Now, each night</i>
<i>at precisely 11:45...</i>

571
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:20,918
SISKO:
<i>Al, one of the count men,</i>
<i>takes a break to call home.</i>

572
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:22,669
<i>He never varies his routine.</i>

573
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:25,089
<i>He's gone for eight minutes</i>
<i>every night.</i>

574
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:29,009
VIC:
<i>During those eight minutes,</i>
<i>Howard, the other count man</i>

575
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,386
<i>has a martini brought in.</i>

576
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:32,346
EZRI:
<i>That's where I come in</i>

577
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:35,141
<i>but first, I make a stop</i>
<i>at poker table three</i>

578
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:36,976
<i>where I hand a drink to Julian.</i>

579
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,227
BASHIR:
<i>And I slip a few drops</i>

580
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:39,853
<i>of ipecac into Howard's.</i>

581
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:46,026
EZRI:
<i>After which</i>

582
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,861
<i>I continue on</i>
<i>to the count room.</i>

583
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,801
<i>I set the tray down and leave.</i>

584
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:14,888
VIC:
<i>Once Ezri's out</i>
<i>of the count room...</i>

585
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,807
KASIDY:
<i>I go running up to the guard</i>

586
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:19,352
<i>and tell him Chief O'Brien</i>
<i>has stolen my chips.</i>

587
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,563
VIC:
<i>Do whatever you need to do</i>
<i>to keep him distracted</i>

588
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:26,859
<i>and don't be afraid</i>
<i>to turn on the waterworks.</i>

589
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,861
<i>And, Chief, you play innocent.</i>

590
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,737
O'BRIEN:
<i>I am innocent.</i>

591

<i>I've never seen this woman</i>
<i>before in my life.</i>

592
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:33,740
VIC:
<i>That's the ticket.</i>

593
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,533
<i>Now, remember, the two of you</i>

594
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,161
<i>have to keep that guard</i>
<i>away from the door</i>

595
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:39,038
<i>for at least two minutes.</i>

596
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:41,623
BASHIR:
<i>Once he takes a sip</i>
<i>of his drink</i>

597
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:44,377
<i>Howard will come flying out of</i>
<i>that count room at warp speed.</i>

<i>Which is where</i> I<i> come in.</i>

VIC:
<i>You and those fabulous</i>
<i>Ferengi ears of yours.</i>

<i>And once</i>
<i>I've opened the safe...</i>

601
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:05,356
ODO:
<i>You'll need someplace</i>
<i>to put all that money.</i>

602
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:07,525
VIC:
<i>You're going to be surprised</i>

603
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:09,109
<i>how much</i>
<i>a million bucks weighs.</i>

604
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,404
ODO:
<i>I think I can handle it.</i>

605
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,951
VIC:
<i>When you walk into the casino,</i>
<i>don't talk to anyone.</i>

606
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:21,579
<i>Don't even look at anyone,</i>
<i>and whatever you do, don't</i>
<i>run.</i>

607
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:23,457
<i>Just head for the exit</i>

608
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:26,168
<i>and dump the cash</i>
<i>in the garbage cans outside.</i>

609
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:28,921
<i>With no money,</i>
<i>there's no skim for Mr. Zeemo</i>

610
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,840
<i>and old Frankie</i>
<i>becomes yesterday's news.</i>

611
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,551
BASHIR:
<i>Then everything</i>
<i>returns to normal</i>

612
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:35,302
and we pop open the champagne.

613
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,513
Music to my ears, pally.

614
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:39,265
Eight minutes.

615
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:41,599
That's how long we have
to get into the count room

616
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:44,562
open the safe, grab the money,
and then get out again.

617
00:26:44,562 --> 00:26:46,063
I bet we do it in five.

618
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:48,774
When do we pull off the caper?

619
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:49,858
The sooner the better.

620
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,527
Zeemo's due in two days.

621
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:52,819
Then we have no choice.

622
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,447
We go tomorrow night.

Hey.

624
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,157
Crazy.

625
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:10,045
That was fast.

626
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,338
It has to be.

627
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:22,933
Two minutes, 14 seconds.

628
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:24,726
I've got to do
a lot better than that.

629
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,061
Right.

630
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:34,652
Go.

00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,257
Better finish
getting dressed.

It's almost time.

Only wish
I could see more.

Well, you know
what they say.

"Good things come
to those who wait."

Who are "they"

00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:00,280

have they seen?

644
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,657
I never kiss and tell.

Too much?

we blow some of my money
at the crap tables?

Maybe later.

Right now, I want you
to buy me a drink.

"Footsies"?
I guess that's a start.

What money?

712
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,332

What do you
mean, "uh-oh"?

719

We don't have
time for "uh-oh."

The safe-- it has
an auto-relock tumbler.

721
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:08,487
Kira didn't mention anything
about an auto-relock tumbler.

722
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,572
Well, she obviously
didn't know about it.

Keep working.

This is the hand
that shook the hand
of Bugsy Siegel.

726
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,334
The man that
built Las Vegas.

727
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:24,837
I'm telling you
he was a visionary.

728
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:28,340
And is there even one statue
of the guy in this town?

729
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,717
There's no justice.

730
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,385
You can say that again.

731
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,765
Sure you don't want to
play the tables for awhile?

732
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:39,309
I'm perfectly content
right here.

733
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:41,812
Well, who am I to
argue with a lady?

What are you standing
around for? Arrest him.

735
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,029
I told you he took $200
worth of chips from me.

736

Well, how come
I only got five bucks on me?

737
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,448
Don't believe him.

738
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,908

00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,340

You keep staring at that watch.

I hadn't noticed.

755
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,329
And your drink.

756

You haven't touched it.

Oh, well,

00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:45,625
I've got to pace myself.

We weren't expecting you
until tomorrow.

I'm early.
Any problem with that?

767
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,352
No, not at all.

768
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,354
Sit down.
