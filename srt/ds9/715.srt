1
00:00:02,263 --> 00:00:03,424
Sure, I remember <i>The Alamo.</i>

2
00:00:03,465 --> 00:00:04,524
See? I told you he would.

3
00:00:04,567 --> 00:00:06,365
Laurence Harvey, Richard Widmark

4
00:00:06,403 --> 00:00:07,803
and John Wayne as Davy Crockett.

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,039
Great battle scenes,
nice sets, but way too long.

6
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:12,740
We're not talking
about a movie.

7
00:00:12,781 --> 00:00:14,944
No, we're, we're talking
about our holosuite program.

8
00:00:14,985 --> 00:00:16,180
Oh, that Alamo.

9
00:00:16,221 --> 00:00:17,621
What about it?

10
00:00:17,657 --> 00:00:19,182
Well, we've got
Holosuite 4 booked for an hour

11
00:00:19,226 --> 00:00:20,819
and were wondering
whether you'd like to join us?

12
00:00:20,863 --> 00:00:24,393
Look, fellas, I'm touched by
the offer, but I don't know.

13
00:00:24,436 --> 00:00:26,838
Well, we can transfer your
matrix to the Alamo program.

14
00:00:26,873 --> 00:00:28,739
You've got to leave
Vegas sometimes, right?

15
00:00:28,777 --> 00:00:31,304
Oh, true, but I'm afraid
I have to say no.

16
00:00:31,348 --> 00:00:32,213
Why?

17
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:34,013
I don't look good in buckskin.

18
00:00:35,522 --> 00:00:36,990
Tell you what I'll do, though.

19
00:00:37,025 --> 00:00:38,050
How about a little tune

20
00:00:38,093 --> 00:00:40,359
to get you
into a Texas state of mind?

21
00:00:40,397 --> 00:00:44,530
Fellas..."Alamo."

22
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,947
Standing around by the Alamo

23
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:55,389
Walkin' around in San Antonio

24
00:00:55,424 --> 00:00:59,090
Looking around
for a new kind of love

25
00:00:59,131 --> 00:01:01,465
Baby, I'm lonesome tonight

26
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:07,541
History abounds
by this famous fort

27
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,713
Davy Crockett really came...

28
00:01:21,705 --> 00:01:23,834
Hey, come on, step down here!

29
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:34,487
Oh, honey!

30
00:01:37,967 --> 00:01:39,960
Show me, show me!

31
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,278
Way to go, baby!

32
00:01:46,316 --> 00:01:47,614
Off the stage!
Get down!

33
00:01:50,557 --> 00:01:52,116
What the hell...?

34
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,128
What is all this?!

35
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:54,288
Don't ask me!

36
00:01:54,363 --> 00:01:55,592
Maybe there's a pointer fault

37
00:01:55,632 --> 00:01:57,157
in the holosuite's
parameter file.

38
00:01:57,203 --> 00:01:59,069
Well, look who's here.

39
00:02:00,074 --> 00:02:01,804
The pretty boy singer himself.

40
00:02:01,844 --> 00:02:04,178
Frankie Eyes.

41
00:02:04,215 --> 00:02:06,344
What are you doing in Vegas?

42
00:02:06,385 --> 00:02:07,410
Whatever happened to

43
00:02:07,454 --> 00:02:09,184
"Hello, Frankie.
Long time no see.

44
00:02:09,224 --> 00:02:10,419
"Make yourself at home.

45
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:11,688
Can I get you anything?"

46
00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:15,628
Do you believe this guy?

47
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:17,261
No manners.

48
00:02:17,305 --> 00:02:19,275
You born in a barn
or something?

49
00:02:19,308 --> 00:02:20,799
This gentleman
a friend of yours?

50
00:02:20,845 --> 00:02:22,211
We know each other.

51
00:02:22,248 --> 00:02:24,718
We're a long way from South
Philly, ain't we, Vic?

52
00:02:26,321 --> 00:02:28,291
So, are you here on business
or pleasure?

53
00:02:28,325 --> 00:02:29,623
Let's just say I'm here to stay

54
00:02:29,661 --> 00:02:32,598
while you, Vicky-boy,
are about to take a powder.

55
00:02:32,633 --> 00:02:34,762
I'm not going anywhere.

56
00:02:34,803 --> 00:02:36,032
I got news for you, pal

57
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,506
I just bought this hotel.

58
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:38,635
You're history.

59
00:02:38,677 --> 00:02:40,806
You can't fire me.
I have a contract.

60
00:02:40,848 --> 00:02:42,680
And you can paper your walls
with it.

61
00:02:42,717 --> 00:02:44,549
You're finished
in this town, Vic.

62
00:02:44,588 --> 00:02:45,954
You're blackballing me?

63
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,288
As of this moment

64
00:02:47,326 --> 00:02:49,592
you couldn't get a job
as a singing busboy.

65
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,759
Now, are you going
to walk out of here

66
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,861
or do you have
to be carried out?

67
00:02:53,904 --> 00:02:55,065
Makes no difference to me.

68
00:02:55,106 --> 00:02:56,972
Let me handle this.

69
00:02:57,009 --> 00:03:00,607
Computer, delete characters

70
00:03:00,649 --> 00:03:02,619
Frankie Eyes
and, uh... I'm sorry

71
00:03:02,653 --> 00:03:03,780
I didn't catch your name.

72
00:03:03,822 --> 00:03:04,790
Cicci.

73
00:03:04,824 --> 00:03:06,452
Cicci!

74
00:03:06,493 --> 00:03:09,293
Cicci from the
holosuite's program.

75
00:03:09,365 --> 00:03:11,267
What's a holosuites?

76
00:03:11,302 --> 00:03:12,998
Beats me.

77
00:03:13,038 --> 00:03:15,031
They're still here, Chief.

78
00:03:15,076 --> 00:03:17,444
Computer, freeze program.

79
00:03:22,656 --> 00:03:24,649
There must be a little
problem in the character

80
00:03:24,693 --> 00:03:25,661
deletion algorithm...

81
00:03:25,694 --> 00:03:26,662
I'll show you the door.

82
00:03:26,696 --> 00:03:28,825
Make that a big problem.

83
00:05:27,882 --> 00:05:29,578
So, what's it going
to be, pally?

84
00:05:29,618 --> 00:05:31,588
I guess I start packing.

85
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:32,590
Smart boy.

86
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:33,557
All right, Cicci, come on.

87
00:05:33,593 --> 00:05:35,563
Let's check out my casino.

88
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,075
So, what do we do now?

89
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:45,477
Nothing we can do.

90
00:05:46,882 --> 00:05:49,250
Frankie's a made man, <i>capisce?</i>

91
00:05:49,287 --> 00:05:50,880
No, I'm not talking
about Frankie.

92
00:05:50,924 --> 00:05:53,019
I'm talking about fixing
the entire program.

93
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,756
Well, we could shut it down

94
00:05:54,797 --> 00:05:56,095
manually and reset it

95
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,636
but that would wipe
Vic's memory.

96
00:05:58,671 --> 00:06:00,230
He'd forget everything
that's happened

97
00:06:00,273 --> 00:06:01,298
since we activated him.

98
00:06:01,342 --> 00:06:03,778
Oh, hold on, pally.
Nobody's wiping my memory.

99
00:06:03,813 --> 00:06:04,940
Of course not.

100
00:06:04,982 --> 00:06:07,043
But there must be
some other way.

101
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:08,553
I wish I knew what it was.

102
00:06:08,589 --> 00:06:09,716
I better talk to Felix.

103
00:06:09,758 --> 00:06:11,694
After all, he was the one
who designed this program.

104
00:06:11,727 --> 00:06:12,717
You do that.

105
00:06:12,763 --> 00:06:13,788
In the meantime

106
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:16,495
you stay out of the way
of Frankie Eyes.

107
00:06:16,536 --> 00:06:18,438
You'll get no argument from me.

108
00:06:21,045 --> 00:06:22,638
I'll tell you one thing.

109
00:06:22,681 --> 00:06:24,810
If this Frankie Eyes
hurts Vic in any way

110
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,844
he's going to have
to answer to me.

111
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:28,220
I do not understand

112
00:06:28,257 --> 00:06:31,194
how you could feel
such loyalty for a hologram.

113
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:33,199
He's not just a hologram.

114
00:06:33,232 --> 00:06:34,666
He's my friend.

115
00:06:34,703 --> 00:06:36,331
Don't you like Vic?

116
00:06:36,372 --> 00:06:38,569
As a singer, I find him...

117
00:06:38,609 --> 00:06:39,975
entertaining.

118
00:06:40,012 --> 00:06:42,448
But beyond that, I neither
like him nor dislike him.

119
00:06:42,483 --> 00:06:43,917
He is a hologram

120
00:06:43,952 --> 00:06:45,888
and therefore,
he does not exist.

121
00:06:45,922 --> 00:06:47,447
He does for me.

122
00:06:47,492 --> 00:06:49,256
I just talked to Felix.

123
00:06:49,295 --> 00:06:51,891
I know what's been affecting
Vic's program.

124
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:53,299
It's a jack-in-the-box.

125
00:06:53,335 --> 00:06:54,303
A what?

126
00:06:54,337 --> 00:06:55,305
A jack-in-the-box.

127
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:56,773
It's a children's toy on Earth.

128
00:06:56,808 --> 00:06:58,674
You wind it up and a figure
pops out and goes "boo."

129
00:06:58,712 --> 00:07:00,476
Except this kind
of jack-in-the-box is different.

130
00:07:00,515 --> 00:07:01,483
It doesn't go "boo."

131
00:07:01,517 --> 00:07:02,644
No.

132
00:07:02,686 --> 00:07:04,314
This surprise is buried deep

133
00:07:04,355 --> 00:07:06,257
in the holosuite program.

134
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:07,419
It's meant to shake things up

135
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:08,827
you know...
make things interesting.

136
00:07:08,864 --> 00:07:10,730
I wasn't bored, were you?

137
00:07:10,767 --> 00:07:11,792
Not at all.

138
00:07:11,835 --> 00:07:13,737
I liked Vic's the way it was.

139
00:07:13,773 --> 00:07:15,743
Well, according to Felix,
if we get rid of Frankie Eyes

140
00:07:15,776 --> 00:07:17,746
everything resets
back to the way it was.

141
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,078
Well, that's good to know.

142
00:07:19,115 --> 00:07:20,708
So, how do we get rid
of Frankie Eyes?

143
00:07:20,751 --> 00:07:21,912
Now, that's up to us.

144
00:07:21,953 --> 00:07:24,856
But Felix did warn me
the program is period specific.

145
00:07:24,893 --> 00:07:26,452
In other words,
if we shoot him

146
00:07:26,495 --> 00:07:28,988
we have to use a.45 automatic
and not a phaser.

147
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:30,695
We can't shoot Frankie.
It's too dangerous.

148
00:07:30,736 --> 00:07:32,136
The mob could retaliate
against Vic.

149
00:07:32,172 --> 00:07:33,504
If anything happens
to Vic, his matrix

150
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:35,306
will be eliminated from
the program, permanently.

151
00:07:35,344 --> 00:07:37,940
The news just keeps getting
better, doesn't it?

152
00:07:37,982 --> 00:07:38,950
What news?

153
00:07:38,984 --> 00:07:40,886
Oh, nothing, sir.

154
00:07:40,921 --> 00:07:43,153
We're, uh, talking
about a holosuite program.

155
00:07:43,192 --> 00:07:44,160
Vic Fontaine's hotel

156
00:07:44,227 --> 00:07:46,663
has just been bought by...
gangsters.

157
00:07:46,698 --> 00:07:47,825
I see.

158
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,769
When do you plan
on going back to work?

159
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,230
Right away, sir.

160
00:08:01,325 --> 00:08:03,123
Whatever you decide to do, Chief

161
00:08:03,194 --> 00:08:04,219
count me in.

162
00:08:04,263 --> 00:08:05,424
I owe Vic.

163
00:08:05,465 --> 00:08:06,524
I thought losing my leg

164
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:08,229
was the end
of my Starfleet career.

165
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,499
He taught me otherwise.

166
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:11,064
He changed my life, too...

167
00:08:11,109 --> 00:08:12,304
and Odo's.

168
00:08:12,345 --> 00:08:13,677
Now...

169
00:08:13,714 --> 00:08:15,877
all we need's a plan.

170
00:08:22,128 --> 00:08:24,928
Mmm.
Your daddy would be proud.

171
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:27,130
My daddy taught me
everything I know.

172
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,638
How nice.

173
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,940
So, how was your day?

174
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:33,513
It's getting better.

175
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:35,108
Did something happen?

176
00:08:35,152 --> 00:08:36,950
It's Vic.

177
00:08:36,988 --> 00:08:37,978
Vic?

178
00:08:38,024 --> 00:08:39,049
Vic Fontaine.

179
00:08:39,092 --> 00:08:41,062
A gangster named Frankie Eyes

180
00:08:41,096 --> 00:08:42,189
took over his lounge.

181
00:08:42,264 --> 00:08:43,197
The whole place has changed

182
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,293
and no one's sure
how to change it back.

183
00:08:48,643 --> 00:08:49,736
What?

184
00:08:49,778 --> 00:08:51,805
Nothing.

185
00:08:51,848 --> 00:08:54,876
I guess this sounds
pretty silly to you.

186
00:08:54,921 --> 00:08:56,219
A little.

187
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:58,522
You have to understand

188
00:08:58,561 --> 00:09:00,690
Vic isn't just another
holosuite program.

189
00:09:00,731 --> 00:09:02,860
He's more like a friend.

190
00:09:02,902 --> 00:09:05,839
Kasidy, can we talk
about something else?

191
00:09:05,873 --> 00:09:08,002
Sure.

192
00:09:09,613 --> 00:09:11,845
How come you've
never been to Vic's?

193
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,113
Does it matter?

194
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:14,746
You like going there,
and I don't.

195
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:16,189
Let's leave it at that.

196
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:17,522
I was only asking.

197
00:09:17,562 --> 00:09:19,428
And I gave you my answer.

198
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:24,063
There are times when I
just can't figure you out.

199
00:09:25,242 --> 00:09:29,045
Well... maybe that's part
of the attraction.

200
00:09:30,318 --> 00:09:32,311
Believe that if you want to.

201
00:09:37,831 --> 00:09:39,231
Who is it?

202
00:09:39,334 --> 00:09:40,802
It's Miles and Julian.

203
00:09:40,836 --> 00:09:42,806
Just a minute.

204
00:09:50,187 --> 00:09:51,450
You wouldn't happen to have

205
00:09:51,489 --> 00:09:52,980
an ice pack on you,
would y?

206
00:10:00,272 --> 00:10:01,535
Hey, pally.

207
00:10:01,574 --> 00:10:02,837
Whose side are you on?

208
00:10:02,876 --> 00:10:04,971
I'm sorry, but you've got
three bruised ribs here

209
00:10:05,014 --> 00:10:06,950
and your left wrist
is sprained.

210
00:10:06,983 --> 00:10:08,542
But the good news is

211
00:10:08,586 --> 00:10:10,282
your skull
is still in one piece.

212
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,415
Thanks.

213
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:13,052
I feel better already.

214
00:10:13,095 --> 00:10:14,654
That jack-in-the-box.

215
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,758
I can't believe Felix
would do that to me.

216
00:10:16,801 --> 00:10:18,429
Oh, don't take it
personally, Vic.

217
00:10:18,471 --> 00:10:19,666
He was just trying
to do me a favor

218
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:21,072
by not letting things
get too boring.

219
00:10:21,109 --> 00:10:23,011
I thought that was my job.

220
00:10:23,046 --> 00:10:24,514
Oh, and you're great at it.

221
00:10:24,548 --> 00:10:26,073
You know, we love you.

222
00:10:26,118 --> 00:10:28,680
So, you gonna tell us
what happened?

223
00:10:28,723 --> 00:10:29,918
I slipped in the bathtub.

224
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:31,518
Oh, yeah... and you
knocked over this furniture

225
00:10:31,561 --> 00:10:32,790
looking for a bandage, right?

226
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,230
Something like that.

227
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,770
Frankie sent Tony Cicci
to pay me a little visit.

228
00:10:37,806 --> 00:10:40,572
He wanted to remind me not
to take too long packing.

229
00:10:41,646 --> 00:10:43,137
What is it with you and Frankie?

230
00:10:43,182 --> 00:10:45,982
It goes back to the old
neighborhood when we were kids.

231
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,547
I used to beat him at stickball.

232
00:10:48,591 --> 00:10:49,581
And?

233
00:10:49,627 --> 00:10:50,720
And...

234
00:10:50,762 --> 00:10:53,232
Nothing.
We've been rivals ever since.

235
00:10:53,267 --> 00:10:55,260
That Felix, huh?

236
00:10:55,304 --> 00:10:59,107
When he designs a holosuite
program, he doesn't fool around.

237
00:10:59,144 --> 00:11:00,703
Huh. Tell me about it.

238
00:11:00,747 --> 00:11:01,908
Now, you should get some rest.

239
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:03,508
Maybe take a little vacation.

240
00:11:03,552 --> 00:11:04,815
A vacation?

241
00:11:04,854 --> 00:11:06,288
Did you guys take a vacation

242
00:11:06,324 --> 00:11:08,317
when the Dominion
took over DS9?

243
00:11:08,394 --> 00:11:09,953
It's not the same thing.

244
00:11:09,997 --> 00:11:10,987
It is to me.

245
00:11:11,032 --> 00:11:12,557
This is my life, remember?

246
00:11:12,602 --> 00:11:14,504
I don't run at the
first sign of trouble.

247
00:11:14,538 --> 00:11:16,440
We're not asking you
to run anywhere.

248
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:18,137
We just want you
to stay out of sight

249
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,476
while we come up with a plan.

250
00:11:19,514 --> 00:11:20,539
What plan?

251
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,017
How to get rid of Frankie Eyes.

252
00:11:22,052 --> 00:11:24,113
Odo and Kira are
in the lounge right now.

253
00:11:24,156 --> 00:11:25,681
Doing what?

254
00:11:25,725 --> 00:11:27,023
Checking up on Frankie.

255
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,054
We need to find his weak spot.

256
00:11:30,534 --> 00:11:32,697
I hope you know
what you're getting me into.

257
00:11:32,738 --> 00:11:34,297
If you guys screw up

258
00:11:34,341 --> 00:11:36,743
I'm the one who winds up
buried in the desert.

259
00:11:42,421 --> 00:11:44,687
Here we go, here we go.

260
00:11:55,812 --> 00:11:57,075
Let me guess.

261
00:11:57,115 --> 00:11:59,847
You'll look around here
while I check out the casino?

262
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:05,021
Oh... uh, if you prefer,
I'll go, uh...

263
00:12:05,063 --> 00:12:06,588
Enjoy yourself.

264
00:12:06,632 --> 00:12:09,832
Just remember...
we have a job to do.

265
00:12:14,913 --> 00:12:16,575
Of course.

266
00:12:21,626 --> 00:12:23,596
Then I drive him
out to the woods.

267
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:24,790
Badda-bing, badda-bang!

268
00:12:24,831 --> 00:12:26,094
Three shots
in the back of the head.

269
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:28,399
That's the end
of Little Paulie.

270
00:12:28,438 --> 00:12:30,066
So, what do you
think Frankie says

271
00:12:30,108 --> 00:12:31,235
when I report back in?

272
00:12:31,277 --> 00:12:32,939
"Little Paulie?!

273
00:12:32,979 --> 00:12:36,850
No! I told you to pop
Big Paulie!"

274
00:12:42,363 --> 00:12:43,922
That's the problem
with our business...

275
00:12:43,966 --> 00:12:46,232
too many guys named Paulie!

276
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:53,304
Hit me.

277
00:12:55,854 --> 00:12:57,220
I'm done.

278
00:12:57,256 --> 00:12:59,020
Not so fast.

279
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,221
What kind of card is that

280
00:13:00,262 --> 00:13:01,491
to give such a pretty lady?

281
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:02,658
Hit her again.

282
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,636
Isn't that against the rules?

283
00:13:04,669 --> 00:13:05,967
Don't worry about it.

284
00:13:06,005 --> 00:13:07,030
Double your bet.

285
00:13:17,192 --> 00:13:19,058
Twenty-six.

286
00:13:19,096 --> 00:13:20,325
What's wrong with you?

287
00:13:20,365 --> 00:13:21,526
Again.

288
00:13:26,609 --> 00:13:28,772
You're starting
to aggravate me, pal.

289
00:13:29,815 --> 00:13:30,840
Twenty-one.

290
00:13:30,883 --> 00:13:31,976
Finally.

291
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,578
Pay the lady.

292
00:13:33,621 --> 00:13:34,589
Yes, sir.

293
00:13:34,623 --> 00:13:37,719
If I were you, I'd, uh,
quit while I was ahead.

294
00:13:37,763 --> 00:13:38,890
Hmm.

295
00:13:38,932 --> 00:13:40,560
The name's Frank Chalmers

296
00:13:40,601 --> 00:13:42,126
but everyone calls me
Frankie Eyes.

297
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,160
Why is that?

298
00:13:43,206 --> 00:13:44,674
'Cause I don't miss a trick.

299
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,267
You're very sure of yourself.

300
00:13:46,312 --> 00:13:47,712
Well, doubt is for losers.

301
00:13:47,747 --> 00:13:49,181
And quite a philosopher.

302
00:13:49,217 --> 00:13:50,480
Well, I'm thinking
of writing a book.

303
00:13:50,586 --> 00:13:51,849
What's the title?

304
00:13:51,888 --> 00:13:53,686
Well, maybe you could
help me think one up.

305
00:13:53,724 --> 00:13:56,490
My talents lie
in other directions.

306
00:13:56,563 --> 00:13:57,690
Good title.

307
00:13:57,732 --> 00:13:58,722
Mind if I use it?

308
00:13:58,766 --> 00:14:00,598
I'd say you already
paid for it.

309
00:14:00,637 --> 00:14:03,005
So what do you say we, uh,
hit the roulette table

310
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,771
and see if I can't
buy Chapter One?

311
00:14:11,891 --> 00:14:13,257
Hey, Max...
Max, come here.

312
00:14:13,293 --> 00:14:15,286
I want you to see this.

313
00:14:19,538 --> 00:14:20,665
Ah! Ah!

314
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,326
I don't believe it.
He did it again.

315
00:14:34,364 --> 00:14:36,698
Buddy, I've been hanging out
in bars for 20 years.

316
00:14:36,735 --> 00:14:38,169
I ain't never seen
a stunt like that.

317
00:14:38,204 --> 00:14:39,934
There's nothing to it, really.

318
00:14:39,974 --> 00:14:41,135
Did you hear that?

319
00:14:41,176 --> 00:14:42,405
Guy's the eighth
wonder of the world

320
00:14:42,445 --> 00:14:43,913
and he says there's
nothing to it.

321
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:46,351
So, where you from again?

322
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,513
Bajor.

323
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,820
That's in Jersey, right?

324
00:14:49,858 --> 00:14:50,848
Right.

325
00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:53,529
Max, Max...

326
00:14:53,599 --> 00:14:55,501
another round
for my friend here.

327
00:14:58,107 --> 00:15:01,409
Turns out Frankie Eyes
was sent to Vegas

328
00:15:01,447 --> 00:15:04,213
by a man named Carl Zeemo.

329
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:08,020
Huh. Looks like Frankie's
moving up in the world.

330
00:15:08,058 --> 00:15:10,153
You know Mr. Zeemo?

331
00:15:10,196 --> 00:15:11,630
Been around forever.

332
00:15:11,665 --> 00:15:13,794
Likes to pretend
he's a sweet old man

333
00:15:13,835 --> 00:15:16,931
but he's meaner
than a junkyard dog.

334
00:15:16,974 --> 00:15:19,638
This is all starting
to make sense.

335
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:22,616
I knew Frankie didn't have
the money to buy a hotel.

336
00:15:22,652 --> 00:15:24,018
But Zeemo does.

337
00:15:24,054 --> 00:15:25,283
More than enough.

338
00:15:25,323 --> 00:15:27,657
This is going to be
a pretty sweet deal for him.

339
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:31,189
The casino's bringing in
about a million bucks a month...

340
00:15:31,233 --> 00:15:32,462
cash...

341
00:15:32,502 --> 00:15:35,371
and out of that,
Zeemo expects to be sent

342
00:15:35,408 --> 00:15:37,454
a couple hundred grand.

343
00:15:37,586 --> 00:15:40,148
That would be the "skim."

344
00:15:40,192 --> 00:15:42,822
Right off the top.
Tax free.

345
00:15:42,863 --> 00:15:44,161
Frankie's got nothing
to worry about.

346
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:46,294
All he's got to do
is send Mr. Zeemo his cut.

347
00:15:46,335 --> 00:15:47,564
According to Frankie

348
00:15:47,604 --> 00:15:50,074
Mr. Zeemo's coming into town
in about six days

349
00:15:50,109 --> 00:15:51,702
to pick up his first payment.

350
00:15:51,746 --> 00:15:53,044
He's never been to Vegas

351
00:15:53,081 --> 00:15:55,779
and he wants to look over
his newest acquisition.

352
00:15:55,819 --> 00:15:56,912
What would happen to Frankie

353
00:15:56,955 --> 00:16:00,051
if, uh, he didn't
give Zeemo his "skim"?

354
00:16:01,597 --> 00:16:03,726
No, Frankie's not that dumb.

355
00:16:03,767 --> 00:16:06,602
Miles, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

356
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,130
Well, it depends
on what you're thinking.

357
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,805
All we have to do
is see to it that Mr. Zeemo

358
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:12,816
doesn't see a penny
of that money.

359
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:15,218
Are you talking
about robbing the casino?

360
00:16:15,255 --> 00:16:16,917
That's what I was thinking.

361
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,153
Isn't it dangerous?

362
00:16:18,193 --> 00:16:21,393
Stealing from the mob?
You bet it is.

363
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:24,233
You get caught,
and I kiss the world good-bye.

364
00:16:24,271 --> 00:16:26,173
Well, then the trick is
not to get caught.

365
00:16:27,409 --> 00:16:29,139
You guys are nuts,
you know that?

366
00:16:30,315 --> 00:16:32,147
Besides, the money's
kept in a safe.

367
00:16:32,185 --> 00:16:33,312
What kind of safe?

368
00:16:33,354 --> 00:16:35,415
I don't know...
it's in the count room.

369
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:38,919
And there's a guard
outside the door 24 hours a day.

370
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:40,489
And even if you did get past him

371
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:42,503
there's still
that little problem

372
00:16:42,536 --> 00:16:44,198
of the two count men inside.

373
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,936
I'll get a look at the safe.

374
00:16:45,976 --> 00:16:48,105
We'll figure out
a way to take out the guard.

375
00:16:48,147 --> 00:16:49,342
And the count men.

376
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,045
And anything else
that comes along.

377
00:16:51,085 --> 00:16:52,110
Then we're agreed?

378
00:16:52,154 --> 00:16:53,213
Absolutely.

379
00:16:53,256 --> 00:16:54,690
- I'm in.
- Me, too.

380
00:16:54,725 --> 00:16:55,818
Sure.

381
00:16:55,861 --> 00:16:56,886
Okay.

382
00:16:56,929 --> 00:16:58,295
Let's do it!

383
00:16:58,332 --> 00:16:59,960
Wait a minute.

384
00:17:00,001 --> 00:17:01,469
Let me get this straight.

385
00:17:01,505 --> 00:17:03,600
You're going
to knock over the casino

386
00:17:03,641 --> 00:17:06,635
and swipe a cool million
from the mob?

387
00:17:06,681 --> 00:17:07,740
Vic...

388
00:17:07,783 --> 00:17:10,583
you want your lounge back
or not?

389
00:17:14,294 --> 00:17:15,319
Deal me in.

390
00:17:27,017 --> 00:17:29,510
Have you ever seen
a prettier shade of green?

391
00:17:29,555 --> 00:17:32,117
Looks like you had
a profitable night.

392
00:17:33,462 --> 00:17:34,794
And the night's not over.

393
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,293
Is that for me

394
00:17:37,335 --> 00:17:38,826
or, uh...

395
00:17:40,073 --> 00:17:42,509
am I just keeping
it warm for you?

396
00:17:42,544 --> 00:17:43,705
It's all yours, baby

397
00:17:43,747 --> 00:17:45,375
and there's more
where that came from.

398
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:48,216
I'll, uh, take your word for it.

399
00:17:48,255 --> 00:17:49,655
What are you looking at?!

400
00:17:49,691 --> 00:17:50,852
Nothing.

401
00:17:50,893 --> 00:17:52,384
Just keep counting.

402
00:17:56,002 --> 00:17:57,061
After you, sweetheart.

403
00:18:11,062 --> 00:18:13,965
Are you sure you didn't
go to high school in Asheville

404
00:18:14,002 --> 00:18:15,300
North Carolina?

405
00:18:15,337 --> 00:18:17,203
Yeah. I'm positive.

406
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,367
That's funny.

407
00:18:18,409 --> 00:18:21,380
You look just like the captain
of our football team.

408
00:18:21,481 --> 00:18:23,211
I had such a crush on him.

409
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:28,584
Well, um, actually, I, um...

410
00:18:28,627 --> 00:18:29,925
I did play a little football.

411
00:18:29,963 --> 00:18:31,124
I knew it.

412
00:18:31,165 --> 00:18:32,724
You have the body of an athlete.

413
00:18:38,278 --> 00:18:39,268
You call this a cheese-steak?

414
00:18:39,314 --> 00:18:39,939
Hmm?

415
00:18:41,116 --> 00:18:43,416
I wouldn't feed this
to my parole officer.

416
00:18:43,454 --> 00:18:44,854
Excuse me, uh, Cicci...

417
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,017
uh, could I have
a word with you?

418
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:47,995
Just a second, please.

419
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:50,693
Now, I want
a real cheese-steak

420
00:18:50,734 --> 00:18:51,793
and I don't care

421
00:18:51,836 --> 00:18:53,829
if you gotta fly to
Philadelphia to get it.

422
00:18:58,414 --> 00:19:00,110
A guy could starve to death
in this town.

423
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,948
Ezri...

424
00:19:01,988 --> 00:19:03,081
this is Tony Cicci.

425
00:19:03,123 --> 00:19:04,216
Nice to meet you.

426
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:05,989
Oh...

427
00:19:06,028 --> 00:19:08,191
pleasure's all mine.

428
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:09,825
Ezri's new in town.

429
00:19:09,868 --> 00:19:12,065
She needs a job.

430
00:19:12,106 --> 00:19:14,042
I'm a very good waitress.

431
00:19:14,076 --> 00:19:15,408
Aah...
you wouldn't happen to have

432
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:16,879
a slice of pizza
on you, would you?

433
00:19:18,017 --> 00:19:20,249
No, but... I could go
to the kitchen and get you one.

434
00:19:20,287 --> 00:19:22,655
Aah! That chef wouldn't
know a good pizza

435
00:19:22,691 --> 00:19:23,989
if it hit him right in the face.

436
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,398
Consider yourself
gainfully employed.

437
00:19:30,439 --> 00:19:31,930
Really?

438
00:19:31,975 --> 00:19:33,568
That's wonderful.

439
00:19:33,611 --> 00:19:35,045
Thanks, Cicci.
I owe you one.

440
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,446
Ah, don't mention it, Stretch.

441
00:19:36,516 --> 00:19:38,178
Maybe one of these days,
you'll show me

442
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:39,380
that, uh...

443
00:19:43,295 --> 00:19:44,627
I don't believe it.

444
00:19:46,167 --> 00:19:47,567
Take it...
Take it easy, pally.

445
00:19:47,602 --> 00:19:48,695
Take it easy!

446
00:19:48,738 --> 00:19:49,706
I'm not looking for trouble.

447
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,867
Well, that's a relief.

448
00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:52,434
I'm here to see Frankie.

449
00:19:52,478 --> 00:19:54,812
I want to try to work
things out with him.

450
00:19:54,849 --> 00:19:56,819
You know,
let bygones be bygones.

451
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,921
Frankie, I'm dying here.

452
00:20:01,962 --> 00:20:04,057
The Sands, the Dunes, the D. I...

453
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,796
no one will even return my call.

454
00:20:05,836 --> 00:20:07,999
Tell me something
I don't know.

455
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,772
There's got to be a way for us
to bury the hatchet.

456
00:20:10,811 --> 00:20:12,872
I already did...

457
00:20:12,915 --> 00:20:14,144
in your head.

458
00:20:14,184 --> 00:20:17,019
Frankie, you want me
to beg, I'll beg.

459
00:20:17,056 --> 00:20:19,322
Give me a chance
to make things right.

460
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,830
I know people... people
with dough, high rollers.

461
00:20:21,865 --> 00:20:24,529
I could bring them
into the casino.

462
00:20:24,569 --> 00:20:26,197
What?

463
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,505
You want to be my shill?

464
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,533
I'm talking about people

465
00:20:29,612 --> 00:20:31,548
who can drop ten, 20,
30 big ones a night.

466
00:20:31,649 --> 00:20:33,311
Give him what he wants, Frankie.

467
00:20:33,352 --> 00:20:35,379
I can't take much
more of his whining.

468
00:20:36,992 --> 00:20:38,153
Bring in a couple of players...

469
00:20:38,194 --> 00:20:39,457
then we'll talk.

470
00:20:39,496 --> 00:20:40,930
That's all I ask.

471
00:20:40,965 --> 00:20:42,901
Let me buy you a drink.

472
00:20:42,936 --> 00:20:44,963
I don't drink with losers.

473
00:20:45,006 --> 00:20:47,135
Come on, dollface...

474
00:20:47,177 --> 00:20:50,343
let's, uh, warm up
the poker table.

475
00:20:55,926 --> 00:20:57,292
Welcome back.

476
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:02,965
You're in charge of what?

477
00:21:03,005 --> 00:21:04,439
Of distracting the guard

478
00:21:04,475 --> 00:21:06,468
so that we can sneak someone
into the count room.

479
00:21:06,511 --> 00:21:08,845
Kasidy, I can't believe
you're involved in this thing.

480
00:21:08,882 --> 00:21:10,316
The whole thing
is ridiculous.

481
00:21:10,351 --> 00:21:12,480
I guess that means you're
not going to wish me luck.

482
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:13,547
And you're telling me

483
00:21:13,591 --> 00:21:15,389
that virtually
my entire senior staff

484
00:21:15,428 --> 00:21:17,330
is a part of this nonsense.

485
00:21:17,364 --> 00:21:19,060
You're supposed
to help your friends

486
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,500
when they're in trouble

487
00:21:20,537 --> 00:21:22,439
and Vic, hologram or not,
is in trouble.

488
00:21:22,473 --> 00:21:23,839
Not that I expect you to care.

489
00:21:23,876 --> 00:21:26,005
Look, this is not
about Vic Fontaine.

490
00:21:26,046 --> 00:21:27,378
Then what is your problem?

491
00:21:27,415 --> 00:21:28,849
You want to know?

492
00:21:28,885 --> 00:21:31,583
You really want to know
what my problem is?

493
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,252
I'll tell you:
Las Vegas, 1962.

494
00:21:34,295 --> 00:21:35,422
That's my problem.

495
00:21:35,464 --> 00:21:38,492
In 1962, black people
weren't very welcome there.

496
00:21:38,536 --> 00:21:40,938
Oh, sure, they could be
performers or janitors

497
00:21:40,973 --> 00:21:42,464
but customers... never.

498
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,604
Maybe that's the way
it was in the real Vegas

499
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,877
but that is not
the way it is at Vic's.

500
00:21:46,918 --> 00:21:49,218
I have never
felt uncomfortable there

501
00:21:49,255 --> 00:21:50,780
and neither has Jake.

502
00:21:50,824 --> 00:21:51,792
But don't you see?

503
00:21:51,826 --> 00:21:53,385
That's the lie.

504
00:21:53,429 --> 00:21:55,456
In 1962,
the Civil Rights Movement

505
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,968
was still in its infancy.

506
00:21:57,002 --> 00:21:58,595
It wasn't an easy time
for our people

507
00:21:58,638 --> 00:22:00,733
and I'm not going
to pretend that it was.

508
00:22:02,045 --> 00:22:03,138
Baby...

509
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:05,983
I know that Vic's

510
00:22:06,018 --> 00:22:08,352
isn't a totally accurate
representation

511
00:22:08,389 --> 00:22:12,419
of the way things were,
but it isn't meant to be.

512
00:22:12,463 --> 00:22:15,525
It shows us the way
things could have been.

513
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:17,299
The way they should have been.

514
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:19,832
We cannot ignore
the truth about the past.

515
00:22:19,876 --> 00:22:22,608
Going to Vic's isn't
going to make us forget

516
00:22:22,715 --> 00:22:24,947
who we are
or where we came from.

517
00:22:24,986 --> 00:22:26,614
What it does is reminds us

518
00:22:26,688 --> 00:22:29,659
that we are no longer bound
by any limitations...

519
00:22:30,663 --> 00:22:33,463
except the ones
we impose on ourselves.

520
00:22:44,186 --> 00:22:45,586
What about Worf?

521
00:22:45,623 --> 00:22:47,387
Oh, he'll never agree to it.

522
00:22:47,426 --> 00:22:49,156
There's always Quark.

523
00:22:49,195 --> 00:22:50,959
I'm not sure he'd help.

524
00:22:50,999 --> 00:22:53,231
He thinks of you
as his competition.

525
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:56,102
I'll get it.

526
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:57,872
Better get this out of sight.

527
00:23:02,153 --> 00:23:04,453
There's one little problem.

528
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:05,458
We're still one man short.

529
00:23:05,492 --> 00:23:06,585
We need a high roller

530
00:23:06,627 --> 00:23:08,152
with Vic at the craps table.

531
00:23:08,197 --> 00:23:09,460
Someone to gather a crowd

532
00:23:09,499 --> 00:23:10,967
keep attention away
from the count room.

533
00:23:11,002 --> 00:23:13,768
Otherwise, the whole plan
falls apart.

534
00:23:13,807 --> 00:23:16,642
And we certainly can't
let that happen.

535
00:23:16,746 --> 00:23:18,112
Now...

536
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:20,641
exactly what do you
need me to do?

537
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,626
Let's go over it
one more time.

538
00:23:26,663 --> 00:23:28,427
Do we have to?

539
00:23:28,467 --> 00:23:30,664
Everyone knows
what they have to do, right?

540
00:23:30,738 --> 00:23:32,674
It's all pretty simple, really.

541
00:23:32,707 --> 00:23:34,005
Hey, far be it from me

542
00:23:34,043 --> 00:23:37,139
to tell Starfleet officers
how to do their jobs.

543
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:38,514
Well, robbing casinos

544
00:23:38,551 --> 00:23:42,183
isn't part of any Starfleet
job description I've ever read.

545
00:23:42,225 --> 00:23:43,693
We can't afford
to make any mistakes.

546
00:23:43,794 --> 00:23:45,319
And we're not going to.

547
00:23:45,363 --> 00:23:46,695
Take us through it again.

548
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:48,760
You got it, pally.

549
00:23:52,209 --> 00:23:53,837
It all begins with you

550
00:23:53,879 --> 00:23:55,906
keeping Frankie Eyes
away from the casino

551
00:23:55,949 --> 00:23:56,974
and the count room.

552
00:24:04,698 --> 00:24:07,066
Meanwhile, the Captain and I

553
00:24:07,103 --> 00:24:08,503
will be laying down
some heavy bread

554
00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:11,510
over at the craps table...
enough to draw a crowd.

555
00:24:11,544 --> 00:24:14,071
Where are we going to get
that kind of money?

556
00:24:14,115 --> 00:24:17,349
I put a little away
for a rainy day.

557
00:24:17,388 --> 00:24:21,157
Now, each night
at precisely 11:45...

558
00:24:21,195 --> 00:24:25,157
Al, one of the count men,
takes a break to call home.

559
00:24:25,202 --> 00:24:26,602
He never varies his routine.

560
00:24:26,637 --> 00:24:28,664
He's gone for eight minutes
every night.

561
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:32,841
During those eight minutes,
Howard, the other count man

562
00:24:32,882 --> 00:24:34,350
has a martini brought in.

563
00:24:34,385 --> 00:24:36,047
That's where I come in

564
00:24:36,088 --> 00:24:38,854
but first, I make a stop
at poker table three

565
00:24:38,893 --> 00:24:40,725
where I hand a drink to Julian.

566
00:24:40,797 --> 00:24:43,632
And I slip a few drops
of ipecac into Howard's.

567
00:24:48,444 --> 00:24:49,571
After which

568
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,640
I continue on
to the count room.

569
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:14,064
I set the tray down and leave.

570
00:25:15,868 --> 00:25:18,338
Once Ezri's out
of the count room...

571
00:25:18,372 --> 00:25:20,068
I go running up to the guard

572
00:25:20,108 --> 00:25:22,670
and tell him Chief O'Brien
has stolen my chips.

573
00:25:24,517 --> 00:25:27,010
Do whatever you need to do
to keep him distracted

574
00:25:27,054 --> 00:25:30,116
and don't be afraid
to turn on the waterworks.

575
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,528
And, Chief, you play innocent.

576
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:33,998
I am innocent.

577
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:35,865
I've never seen this woman
before in my life.

578
00:25:35,904 --> 00:25:37,395
That's the ticket.

579
00:25:37,439 --> 00:25:38,600
Now, remember, the two of you

580
00:25:38,642 --> 00:25:40,406
have to keep that guard
away from the door

581
00:25:40,444 --> 00:25:42,607
for at least two minutes.

582
00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:44,983
Once he takes a sip
of his drink

583
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,752
Howard will come flying out of
that count room at warp speed.

584
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,024
Which is where I come in.

585
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,166
You and those fabulous
Ferengi ears of yours.

586
00:26:03,118 --> 00:26:05,020
And once I've opened the safe...

587
00:26:05,056 --> 00:26:08,825
You'll need someplace
to put all that money.

588
00:26:08,862 --> 00:26:10,855
You're going to be surprised

589
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,528
how much
a million bucks weighs.

590
00:26:12,569 --> 00:26:14,698
I think I can handle it.

591
00:26:18,347 --> 00:26:21,513
When you walk into the casino,
don't talk to anyone.

592
00:26:21,552 --> 00:26:24,888
Don't even look at anyone,
and whatever you do, don't run.

593
00:26:24,925 --> 00:26:26,518
Just head for the exit

594
00:26:26,561 --> 00:26:29,657
and dump the cash
in the garbage cans outside.

595
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,262
With no money,
there's no skim for Mr. Zeemo

596
00:26:32,305 --> 00:26:35,208
and old Frankie
becomes yesterday's news.

597
00:26:35,243 --> 00:26:36,905
Then everything
returns to normal

598
00:26:36,947 --> 00:26:38,677
and we pop open the champagne.

599
00:26:38,716 --> 00:26:41,186
Music to my ears, pally.

600
00:26:41,221 --> 00:26:42,280
Eight minutes.

601
00:26:42,323 --> 00:26:44,987
That's how long we have
to get into the count room

602
00:26:45,028 --> 00:26:47,897
open the safe, grab the money,
and then get out again.

603
00:26:47,932 --> 00:26:49,332
I bet we do it in five.

604
00:26:49,368 --> 00:26:52,066
When do we pull off the caper?

605
00:26:52,107 --> 00:26:53,166
The sooner the better.

606
00:26:53,209 --> 00:26:54,871
Zeemo's due in two days.

607
00:26:54,912 --> 00:26:56,141
Then we have no choice.

608
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:57,911
We go tomorrow night.

609
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,350
Hey.

610
00:26:59,386 --> 00:27:00,376
Crazy.

611
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:13,241
That was fast.

612
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,474
It has to be.

613
00:27:24,466 --> 00:27:26,264
Two minutes, 14 seconds.

614
00:27:26,302 --> 00:27:27,998
I've got to do
a lot better than that.

615
00:27:28,038 --> 00:27:29,267
Right.

616
00:27:36,887 --> 00:27:37,946
Go.

617
00:27:57,224 --> 00:27:58,624
Better finish getting dressed.

618
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,923
It's almost time.

619
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:26,642
I'm telling you, Morn

620
00:28:26,677 --> 00:28:29,911
something's going on in Vic's
that we don't know about.

621
00:28:49,117 --> 00:28:51,178
Looking good as usual,
dollface.

622
00:28:51,221 --> 00:28:53,316
I'm glad you like what you see.

623
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:55,921
Only wish I could see more.

624
00:28:55,963 --> 00:28:57,727
Well, you know what they say.

625
00:28:57,766 --> 00:29:00,396
"Good things come
to those who wait."

626
00:29:00,437 --> 00:29:01,598
Who are "they"

627
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,506
and how much of you
have they seen?

628
00:29:03,544 --> 00:29:05,012
I never kiss and tell.

629
00:29:05,046 --> 00:29:06,105
I bet you don't.

630
00:29:06,148 --> 00:29:07,844
Whoo! 19!

631
00:29:07,884 --> 00:29:09,716
Let's see if you can beat that.

632
00:29:10,857 --> 00:29:12,655
23. You're busted.

633
00:29:30,525 --> 00:29:32,153
A vodka martini.

634
00:29:32,195 --> 00:29:34,392
Stirred, not shaken.

635
00:29:34,432 --> 00:29:35,764
Right away, sir.

636
00:29:37,171 --> 00:29:39,073
The winner is 17 black.

637
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:43,782
10,000.

638
00:29:43,816 --> 00:29:44,784
Good luck, sir.

639
00:29:44,818 --> 00:29:45,786
We're coming out.

640
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:46,947
Make your bets.
Here they come.

641
00:29:46,988 --> 00:29:48,547
C&E. High-low bets.

642
00:29:51,129 --> 00:29:52,757
$100?

643
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:53,823
Too much?

644
00:29:53,867 --> 00:29:55,233
You're supposed
to be a high roller

645
00:29:55,269 --> 00:29:56,294
so start rolling.

646
00:29:56,338 --> 00:29:58,467
Make it, uh, 2,000.

647
00:29:59,611 --> 00:30:00,806
2,000.

648
00:30:00,847 --> 00:30:02,145
What do you say

649
00:30:02,182 --> 00:30:04,379
we blow some of my money
at the crap tables?

650
00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:05,387
Maybe later.

651
00:30:05,421 --> 00:30:07,948
Right now, I want you
to buy me a drink.

652
00:30:07,992 --> 00:30:11,260
We can play footsies
under the table.

653
00:30:11,298 --> 00:30:14,634
"Footsies"?
I guess that's a start.

654
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:27,554
We have lift-off.

655
00:30:41,186 --> 00:30:43,782
Oh! I'm so sorry!

656
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,653
Don't worry about it.

657
00:30:51,504 --> 00:30:53,336
You're too kind.

658
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,223
Coming out, now.
New shooter.

659
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:08,496
Here's where things
get interesting.

660
00:31:11,707 --> 00:31:13,836
Come on...

661
00:31:13,878 --> 00:31:14,868
seven!

662
00:31:24,864 --> 00:31:26,059
You're not Howard.

663
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,568
He's out with the flu.

664
00:31:29,172 --> 00:31:31,574
Oh. Well, this drink
must be yours, then.

665
00:31:31,609 --> 00:31:33,134
I'm not thirsty.

666
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:35,308
- But...
- Hey

667
00:31:35,349 --> 00:31:37,478
you're making me lose count.

668
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,318
Sorry.

669
00:31:41,027 --> 00:31:42,586
You mind if I drink that?

670
00:31:42,696 --> 00:31:44,028
I've been on my feet
for hours

671
00:31:44,065 --> 00:31:46,035
and I could really use
a little pick-me-up.

672
00:31:46,069 --> 00:31:49,769
That's about the saddest
story I ever heard.

673
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,114
Winner seven, twice.
Shooter's on a roll.

674
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:00,525
Make your bets.

675
00:32:00,561 --> 00:32:01,529
Let it ride.

676
00:32:01,563 --> 00:32:02,531
We're coming out.

677
00:32:02,565 --> 00:32:04,124
Let it ride, let it ride.

678
00:32:04,168 --> 00:32:06,365
He's got a hand going.

679
00:32:06,405 --> 00:32:07,896
Ten dollars on the 11.

680
00:32:18,461 --> 00:32:19,429
You have to help me.

681
00:32:19,462 --> 00:32:20,862
That man,
that man right there...

682
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:21,957
he stole a stack of my chips.

683
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,968
Hey, you!

684
00:32:23,002 --> 00:32:24,027
Stop right there!

685
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,197
Who, me?

686
00:32:26,341 --> 00:32:28,139
The lady says
you stole her chips.

687
00:32:28,177 --> 00:32:29,577
I did no such thing.

688
00:32:29,613 --> 00:32:30,603
Liar!

689
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:32,513
I'm telling you he took them.

690
00:32:32,552 --> 00:32:33,520
You're a thief.

691
00:32:33,554 --> 00:32:34,715
You're drunk.

692
00:32:34,757 --> 00:32:36,385
- I am not!
- Hey, hey.

693
00:32:36,426 --> 00:32:37,621
Let's just calm down here, okay?

694
00:32:37,695 --> 00:32:39,391
Not until I get my money!

695
00:32:39,431 --> 00:32:40,490
What money?

696
00:32:40,533 --> 00:32:41,831
The money you stole!

697
00:32:41,869 --> 00:32:43,964
I told you, I never
touched your money!

698
00:32:44,006 --> 00:32:45,133
Liar!

699
00:32:59,802 --> 00:33:00,963
Uh-oh.

700
00:33:02,907 --> 00:33:04,500
What do you mean, "uh-oh"?

701
00:33:04,543 --> 00:33:06,205
We don't have time for "uh-oh."

702
00:33:06,246 --> 00:33:09,012
The safe... it has
an auto-relock tumbler.

703
00:33:09,051 --> 00:33:11,886
Kira didn't mention anything
about an auto-relock tumbler.

704
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:13,950
Well, she obviously
didn't know about it.

705
00:33:13,994 --> 00:33:15,987
I'm not going
to have enough time.

706
00:33:16,031 --> 00:33:17,329
Keep working.

707
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,770
This is the hand that shook
the hand of Bugsy Siegel.

708
00:33:23,811 --> 00:33:26,213
The man that built Las Vegas.

709
00:33:26,249 --> 00:33:28,515
I'm telling you
he was a visionary.

710
00:33:28,553 --> 00:33:32,117
And is there even one statue
of the guy in this town?

711
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,425
There's no justice.

712
00:33:34,463 --> 00:33:36,056
You can say that again.

713
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:40,504
Sure you don't want to
play the tables for awhile?

714
00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:43,171
I'm perfectly content
right here.

715
00:33:43,212 --> 00:33:45,478
Well, who am I
to argue with a lady?

716
00:33:50,659 --> 00:33:52,287
What are you standing
around for? Arrest him.

717
00:33:52,329 --> 00:33:54,925
I told you he took $200
worth of chips from me.

718
00:33:54,967 --> 00:33:56,560
Well, how come
I only got five bucks on me?

719
00:33:56,603 --> 00:33:57,662
Don't believe him.

720
00:33:57,705 --> 00:33:58,695
I'm telling you, this broad

721
00:33:58,741 --> 00:34:00,039
ain't playing with a full deck.

722
00:34:00,077 --> 00:34:01,602
And just what is that
supposed to mean?

723
00:34:01,646 --> 00:34:02,807
What do you think it means?

724
00:34:04,819 --> 00:34:06,344
Beginner's luck.

725
00:34:06,388 --> 00:34:08,186
For the dealer!

726
00:34:10,195 --> 00:34:11,663
Six minutes.

727
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:13,859
I wonder what's
taking them so long?

728
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,208
I got to go.

729
00:34:18,242 --> 00:34:19,540
I'm running late.

730
00:34:19,578 --> 00:34:20,568
This Frankie Eyes...

731
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,176
You in some kind of hurry?

732
00:34:38,211 --> 00:34:40,272
Me?

733
00:34:40,315 --> 00:34:42,308
You keep staring at that watch.

734
00:34:42,353 --> 00:34:43,946
Really?
I hadn't noticed.

735
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:45,287
And your drink.

736
00:34:45,324 --> 00:34:46,292
You haven't touched it.

737
00:34:46,326 --> 00:34:47,919
Oh, well, the night is young.

738
00:34:47,962 --> 00:34:49,362
I've got to pace myself.

739
00:34:49,398 --> 00:34:50,366
Pace yourself?

740
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,130
- For what?
- Frankie

741
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:54,197
there's someone here
to see you.

742
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,469
I'm busy.

743
00:34:55,509 --> 00:34:57,273
You don't look busy.

744
00:35:00,885 --> 00:35:02,114
Mr. Zeemo.

745
00:35:02,154 --> 00:35:03,693
We weren't expecting you
until tomorrow.

746
00:35:03,827 --> 00:35:06,297
I'm early.
Any problem with that?

747
00:35:06,332 --> 00:35:07,698
No, not at all.

748
00:35:07,734 --> 00:35:09,761
Sit down.
Have a drink.

749
00:35:09,804 --> 00:35:11,272
We'll have a drink later.

750
00:35:11,307 --> 00:35:13,539
Where's the, uh...

751
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:15,103
where's the count room?

752
00:35:15,148 --> 00:35:16,980
Follow me.

753
00:35:17,017 --> 00:35:18,815
Mr. Zeemo?

754
00:35:21,793 --> 00:35:24,457
It's a great honor to meet you.

755
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:25,988
I know.

756
00:35:27,603 --> 00:35:30,597
Frankie has told me
so much about you.

757
00:35:32,178 --> 00:35:33,339
Frankie.

758
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,370
Yeah?

759
00:35:34,482 --> 00:35:36,611
The money, Frankie.

760
00:35:36,653 --> 00:35:38,485
Right this way.

761
00:35:38,522 --> 00:35:40,492
Let's go.
Come on.

762
00:35:45,068 --> 00:35:47,971
Nog, it's been eight minutes.

763
00:35:48,006 --> 00:35:49,440
We're running out of time.

764
00:36:09,278 --> 00:36:10,246
Yeah?

765
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,680
Okay. Yeah, sure.

766
00:36:19,162 --> 00:36:20,152
I fold.

767
00:36:22,636 --> 00:36:23,604
Excuse me.

768
00:36:23,638 --> 00:36:24,606
Your name's Al, right?

769
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:25,607
Who wants to know?

770
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:26,631
Frankie Eyes.

771
00:36:26,676 --> 00:36:27,644
Frankie Eyes?

772
00:36:27,678 --> 00:36:28,646
He's waiting for you.

773
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,978
Out back.

774
00:36:30,016 --> 00:36:32,782
For what?
I didn't do nothing.

775
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,347
Then you have nothing
to worry about.

776
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:48,612
You gotta be kidding me.

777
00:36:48,649 --> 00:36:50,379
Now what?

778
00:36:52,121 --> 00:36:53,146
Zeemo.

779
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,158
He's a day early.

780
00:36:54,192 --> 00:36:56,219
Keep playing.
I'll try to stall him.

781
00:36:56,263 --> 00:36:59,599
Nina?
Nina?

782
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:00,933
Is that you?

783
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:04,100
Who's this?

784
00:37:04,143 --> 00:37:06,773
Nobody. Hey, Vic,
take a walk, huh?

785
00:37:06,815 --> 00:37:09,115
Where you been
keeping yourself, baby?

786
00:37:09,152 --> 00:37:10,984
Do I know you?

787
00:37:11,022 --> 00:37:12,115
Do you know me?

788
00:37:12,157 --> 00:37:13,716
Don't you remember
that week in Miami?

789
00:37:13,761 --> 00:37:16,095
You ever see what she
looks like in a bikini?

790
00:37:16,131 --> 00:37:18,363
Ooh, mama mia.

791
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,531
When were you in Miami?

792
00:37:20,573 --> 00:37:22,439
I don't know
what he's talking about.

793
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,206
Who's this, your grandpa?

794
00:37:24,246 --> 00:37:26,148
Frankie.

795
00:37:26,183 --> 00:37:27,583
Cicci.

796
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:29,315
Now you done it.

797
00:37:29,355 --> 00:37:30,653
Bury him.

798
00:37:30,691 --> 00:37:32,455
So long, sucker.

799
00:37:32,528 --> 00:37:33,894
Frankie

800
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:35,762
- I'm waiting for the money!
- Right this way.

801
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,827
Tonight everybody's a winner!

802
00:38:10,029 --> 00:38:11,497
What's this?
What's going on?

803
00:38:25,423 --> 00:38:27,289
Piece of cake.

804
00:38:36,877 --> 00:38:38,470
Can I go now?

805
00:38:38,513 --> 00:38:39,845
You aren't going anywhere.

806
00:38:39,882 --> 00:38:41,282
Don't let him leave.

807
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:42,843
Charlie.

808
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:45,280
Over here.

809
00:38:49,065 --> 00:38:53,095
Take this, uh,
gentleman to security.

810
00:38:53,139 --> 00:38:55,439
But I wanted you
to handle this.

811
00:38:55,477 --> 00:38:56,843
I'm afraid I can't
leave my post.

812
00:38:56,879 --> 00:38:59,076
Charlie, strip search.

813
00:38:59,117 --> 00:39:00,813
Strip search?!

814
00:39:05,094 --> 00:39:06,460
Uh...

815
00:39:08,868 --> 00:39:10,200
There, there.

816
00:39:10,237 --> 00:39:11,330
It's not worth all that.

817
00:39:11,372 --> 00:39:16,473
I needed that money
t-to buy a gift for my mother.

818
00:39:28,804 --> 00:39:31,536
Funny way to run a casino.

819
00:39:31,609 --> 00:39:33,043
What are you waiting for,
Frankie?

820
00:39:33,078 --> 00:39:35,548
Why don't you show Mr. Zeemo
the count room?

821
00:39:35,616 --> 00:39:37,084
Well, you heard the lady.

822
00:39:37,118 --> 00:39:38,381
I'm telling you, Mr. Zeemo

823
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:41,050
buying this casino
was the smartest move

824
00:39:41,092 --> 00:39:42,060
you ever made.

825
00:39:42,094 --> 00:39:44,462
We're making money
hand over fist.

826
00:39:44,498 --> 00:39:47,435
I just hope you brought
a big enough briefcase.

827
00:39:50,409 --> 00:39:52,811
Where's my money?

828
00:39:52,847 --> 00:39:54,840
Huh?!

829
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:48,779
Now, that's more like it.

830
00:40:51,753 --> 00:40:54,246
Say good-bye to Frankie Eyes.

831
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:55,622
You can tell your friend Felix

832
00:40:55,659 --> 00:40:57,652
that we shut the lid
on his jack-in-the-box.

833
00:40:57,697 --> 00:40:58,790
With pleasure.

834
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:01,631
Ladies and gentlemen,
the bubbly is on me.

835
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,638
Thanks, Vic.

836
00:41:02,672 --> 00:41:04,106
Hear, hear.

837
00:41:04,142 --> 00:41:05,940
Where have you been?

838
00:41:05,978 --> 00:41:07,971
I don't want to talk about it.

839
00:41:12,589 --> 00:41:14,991
Next time you two fight
the battle of the Alamo

840
00:41:15,027 --> 00:41:16,017
count me in.

841
00:41:16,062 --> 00:41:17,826
Coonskin cap and all.

842
00:41:17,866 --> 00:41:19,334
You've got it, pally.

843
00:41:19,369 --> 00:41:22,101
To the best friends
a hologram ever had.

844
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,108
Hear, hear.

845
00:41:23,142 --> 00:41:24,110
Cheers.

846
00:41:24,144 --> 00:41:25,407
I owe you... big time.

847
00:41:25,447 --> 00:41:26,540
Cheers, Vic.

848
00:41:26,582 --> 00:41:27,572
Cheers.

849
00:41:31,891 --> 00:41:34,293
Okay, fellas, let's do it.

850
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,033
Captain?

851
00:41:38,971 --> 00:41:40,701
Will you join me?

852
00:41:43,145 --> 00:41:44,909
What?

853
00:41:50,825 --> 00:41:55,026
Out of the tree of life
I just picked me a plum

854
00:41:58,105 --> 00:42:04,538
You came along
and everything started to hum

855
00:42:05,952 --> 00:42:11,087
still, it's a real good bet
the best is yet to come

856
00:42:14,067 --> 00:42:21,172
The best is yet to come
and, babe, won't it be fine?

857
00:42:21,213 --> 00:42:26,986
You think you've seen the sun,
but you ain't seen it shine

858
00:42:29,461 --> 00:42:33,525
Wait till the warm-up's underway

859
00:42:33,569 --> 00:42:36,165
Wait till our lips have met

860
00:42:36,206 --> 00:42:40,943
Wait till you see
that sunshine day

861
00:42:40,982 --> 00:42:43,452
You ain't seen nothin' yet

862
00:42:43,486 --> 00:42:47,323
The best is yet to come

863
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:52,495
And, babe, won't it be fine?

864
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:59,344
The best is yet to come,
come the day you're mine

865
00:42:59,382 --> 00:43:05,053
Wait till your charms are ripe
for these arms to surround

866
00:43:07,162 --> 00:43:09,598
You think you've flown before

867
00:43:09,634 --> 00:43:13,596
But you ain't left the ground

868
00:43:13,641 --> 00:43:18,912
Now, wait till you're locked
in my embrace

869
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:22,286
Wait till I draw you near

870
00:43:22,323 --> 00:43:27,026
Wait till you see
that sunshine place

871
00:43:27,065 --> 00:43:29,900
Ain't nothin' like it here

872
00:43:29,936 --> 00:43:31,929
The best is yet to come

873
00:43:31,974 --> 00:43:34,774
And, babe, won't it be fine?

874
00:43:38,285 --> 00:43:41,222
The best is
yet to come

875
00:43:41,257 --> 00:43:44,593
The best is yet to come

876
00:43:46,099 --> 00:43:48,331
The best is yet to come

877
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:54,143
Come the day you're mine.
