1
00:00:02,364 --> 00:00:05,668
All right, everyone,
gather around.

2
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:07,676
We're about to start.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,774
When a young Ferengi
goes out on his own

4
00:00:10,817 --> 00:00:12,879
he traditionally raises capital

5
00:00:12,922 --> 00:00:15,861
by selling
his boyhood treasures.

6
00:00:15,896 --> 00:00:18,892
As you know, my son, Nog

7
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:21,602
will be leaving
shortly for Earth

8
00:00:21,643 --> 00:00:23,408
and Starfleet Academy.

9
00:00:23,448 --> 00:00:26,546
I'm going to miss him,
and I know you will, too

10
00:00:26,588 --> 00:00:30,120
and what better way
to remember him

11
00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:35,507
than to purchase one of his
very own personal belongings.

12
00:00:35,544 --> 00:00:38,449
I don't know about you,
but I'm buying these pajamas.

13
00:00:38,484 --> 00:00:40,352
That'll be
three strips of latinum.

14
00:00:40,388 --> 00:00:41,356
Two!

15
00:00:41,391 --> 00:00:42,359
Sold!

16
00:00:42,393 --> 00:00:44,557
Let the buying commence!

17
00:00:44,598 --> 00:00:46,933
No reasonable offer
will be refused.

18
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,587
I didn't expect to see
you here, Mr. Worf.

19
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:58,757
Captain Sisko made it a personal
request that I attend.

20
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:01,863
He seems to have taken some
interest in the young Ferengi.

21
00:01:01,907 --> 00:01:03,240
Well, the Captain sponsored

22
00:01:03,276 --> 00:01:04,905
Nog's application
to the Academy.

23
00:01:04,947 --> 00:01:08,854
A Ferengi at the Academy...
I'm not sure that is wise.

24
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,382
Oh, I don't know about that.

25
00:01:10,427 --> 00:01:12,261
Not so long ago,
someone might have

26
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:13,994
said the same thing about you.

27
00:01:14,036 --> 00:01:15,130
You two better hurry

28
00:01:15,172 --> 00:01:17,541
or there won't
be anything left to buy.

29
00:01:20,685 --> 00:01:22,211
Nog, what is this?

30
00:01:22,255 --> 00:01:24,453
My favorite holosuite program

31
00:01:24,494 --> 00:01:26,897
"A visit with
the Pleasure Goddess of Rixx."

32
00:01:26,934 --> 00:01:29,030
Yours for a mere
ten strips of latinum.

33
00:01:29,072 --> 00:01:31,601
He'll take it.

34
00:01:31,644 --> 00:01:33,512
Well, consider it a gift.

35
00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:35,486
Well, you're too kind.

36
00:01:35,521 --> 00:01:36,820
Nog...

37
00:01:36,857 --> 00:01:39,625
where did you get
this springball racket?

38
00:01:39,663 --> 00:01:41,793
Out of a replicator?

39
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:43,999
Try out of my quarters.
This is mine.

40
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,307
I've been looking for this
for two years.

41
00:01:46,347 --> 00:01:48,818
And it was sitting here
on the bar all along.

42
00:01:48,852 --> 00:01:50,481
That's incredible.

43
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,744
It's a Ferengi tooth sharpener.

44
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:17,384
How much?

45
00:02:23,603 --> 00:02:25,300
Rom.

46
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,775
Brother, you're here.

47
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,610
If you hurry,
there still might be

48
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,676
some choice items
left for you to buy.

49
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,155
I'm not here for the sale.

50
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,161
Nog has no business going
to Starfleet Academy

51
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,166
and I'm not doing anything
to encourage him.

52
00:02:37,435 --> 00:02:38,734
Now, come with me.

53
00:02:38,772 --> 00:02:40,366
But the sale...

54
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:43,177
It's over as far
as you're concerned.

55
00:02:43,216 --> 00:02:45,517
The ship, it's here.

56
00:02:45,554 --> 00:02:47,251
What ship?

57
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,263
The ship, our ship...

58
00:02:49,297 --> 00:02:50,891
my ship?

59
00:02:50,934 --> 00:02:52,928
The shuttle
Cousin Gaila owed me?

60
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:55,444
He's owed you
that shuttle for ten years.

61
00:02:55,512 --> 00:02:57,072
Ever since I loaned
him the latinum

62
00:02:57,116 --> 00:02:58,881
to start up
his munitions consortium.

63
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,552
He always said that
if he became a success

64
00:03:01,593 --> 00:03:04,030
he'd buy me my own ship.

65
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:05,091
Now it's here.

66
00:03:05,135 --> 00:03:07,003
But why do you need me?

67
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:09,101
Because knowing our cousin,
it's probably

68
00:03:09,144 --> 00:03:10,579
defective merchandise.

69
00:03:10,614 --> 00:03:12,744
I'd better have a look at it.

70
00:03:12,787 --> 00:03:14,086
What a wonderful idea.

71
00:03:14,123 --> 00:03:15,285
Now get going.

72
00:03:18,735 --> 00:03:21,640
And leave the clothes... here.

73
00:03:34,606 --> 00:03:36,668
Brother?

74
00:03:36,711 --> 00:03:40,083
All right,
tell me what's wrong with it.

75
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:41,087
Nothing.

76
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:42,283
The ship is perfect!

77
00:03:42,324 --> 00:03:44,454
Gaila must have paid
a fortune for it.

78
00:03:44,496 --> 00:03:46,694
You mean it'll actually fly?

79
00:03:46,735 --> 00:03:49,138
This ship could outrun
a Romulan interceptor.

80
00:03:49,174 --> 00:03:51,475
We could take it halfway
across the galaxy

81
00:03:51,513 --> 00:03:53,950
before it would even
need a maintenance check.

82
00:03:53,985 --> 00:03:55,750
You don't say.

83
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,886
And it's all mine.

84
00:03:57,929 --> 00:04:00,527
I can go anyplace I want.

85
00:04:00,601 --> 00:04:02,161
Maybe it's time you considered

86
00:04:02,206 --> 00:04:04,302
that early retirement
we talked about.

87
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:05,779
I could take over the bar

88
00:04:05,814 --> 00:04:08,308
and you could fly off
into the great unknown

89
00:04:08,353 --> 00:04:09,822
never to return!

90
00:04:11,428 --> 00:04:12,897
Unless you wanted to.

91
00:04:12,931 --> 00:04:14,731
Don't get your hopes up.

92
00:04:14,768 --> 00:04:16,362
The first thing we need to do

93
00:04:16,405 --> 00:04:19,207
is take this thing
for a test flight...

94
00:04:19,246 --> 00:04:23,188
someplace reasonably
far away but safe.

95
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:25,216
Someplace like...

96
00:04:25,261 --> 00:04:26,320
Earth?

97
00:04:26,363 --> 00:04:28,732
Exactly.

98
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:32,005
If the boy wants to go
to Starfleet Academy

99
00:04:32,043 --> 00:04:34,139
he might as well do it in style.

100
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:35,445
Yes, Brother!

101
00:04:35,485 --> 00:04:37,216
Thank you, Brother!

102
00:04:37,256 --> 00:04:39,056
I'll go tell Nog.

103
00:04:39,093 --> 00:04:42,795
A trip to Earth...
this is going to be fun!

104
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:49,214
Not to mention profitable.

105
00:04:49,251 --> 00:04:53,421
All I ask is a tall ship

106
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:56,958
and a load of contraband
to fill her with.

107
00:07:00,847 --> 00:07:04,117
Here are the codes to operate
the holosuite programs.

108
00:07:04,155 --> 00:07:07,094
Now, remember, don't
extend any lines of credit

109
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:08,689
don't touch the dabo girls

110
00:07:08,732 --> 00:07:13,198
and make sure you keep
your eyes on him

111
00:07:13,244 --> 00:07:16,650
because he'll be keeping
his eyes on you.

112
00:07:20,661 --> 00:07:23,293
Good choice, Quark.

113
00:07:23,335 --> 00:07:26,502
I'm sure Morn will do
an excellent job

114
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:29,640
as long as he doesn't
drink up all your profits.

115
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:31,916
Better him than one
of my Ferengi waiters.

116
00:07:31,955 --> 00:07:33,014
They'd rob me blind.

117
00:07:33,057 --> 00:07:34,390
Hmm.

118
00:07:34,427 --> 00:07:38,699
Very generous of you,
taking Nog to Earth.

119
00:07:38,738 --> 00:07:40,868
I'm a generous person.

120
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:42,710
So I've noticed.

121
00:07:42,748 --> 00:07:45,414
Try not to miss me
too much while I'm gone.

122
00:07:45,454 --> 00:07:49,293
I'll be counting the days
until you get back.

123
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,198
Yeah.

124
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:02,521
I wonder how many hours
you and I spent

125
00:08:02,562 --> 00:08:03,997
hanging around up here?

126
00:08:04,032 --> 00:08:05,729
2,147.

127
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,135
Just kidding, but it was a lot.

128
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,344
You know,
aside from playing dom-jot

129
00:08:13,388 --> 00:08:15,689
and watching
the Bajoran transports dock

130
00:08:15,727 --> 00:08:18,757
it seems like we spent most
of our time doing nothing.

131
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,364
Maybe so, but I can't
think of anyone

132
00:08:21,407 --> 00:08:23,901
I'd rather do nothing with
than you.

133
00:08:23,947 --> 00:08:25,975
Same here.

134
00:08:26,018 --> 00:08:27,146
Nog.

135
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,691
Doctor, if you're
trying to return

136
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:32,096
something from the sale...

137
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:33,227
It's a going-away present.

138
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:34,932
To help you get around
easier on Earth.

139
00:08:40,252 --> 00:08:42,189
A guidebook?

140
00:08:42,223 --> 00:08:43,658
It's not just a guidebook.

141
00:08:43,694 --> 00:08:45,665
It's a completely
interactive program

142
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:48,866
detailing Earth's customs,
culture, history, geography...

143
00:08:48,906 --> 00:08:51,309
Everything you ever
wanted to know about Earth

144
00:08:51,346 --> 00:08:52,815
is right there in that padd.

145
00:08:52,849 --> 00:08:55,879
You mean, it'll teach me
how to attract human females?

146
00:08:55,923 --> 00:08:58,862
Well... almost everything.

147
00:08:58,896 --> 00:09:01,026
I'm sure it'll come in handy.
Thank you.

148
00:09:01,068 --> 00:09:02,401
Well, I'd better be going.

149
00:09:02,438 --> 00:09:05,172
My father and Uncle Quark
are waiting for me.

150
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:06,545
Good luck, Nog.

151
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,687
Make us proud.

152
00:09:18,477 --> 00:09:20,242
I'll, uh...

153
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:21,511
I'll walk you over
to the airlock.

154
00:09:31,175 --> 00:09:32,940
That was a good spot.

155
00:09:32,978 --> 00:09:34,140
The best.

156
00:09:44,206 --> 00:09:46,370
The Ferengi Shuttle
<i>Quark's Treasure</i>

157
00:09:46,411 --> 00:09:48,005
has just departed the station.

158
00:09:48,048 --> 00:09:50,816
Quark, Rom and Nog,
together on that ship

159
00:09:50,855 --> 00:09:52,415
all the way to Earth?

160
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,984
Glad I'm not going with them.

161
00:09:54,028 --> 00:09:55,520
Only thing that worries me...

162
00:09:55,566 --> 00:09:58,003
no one warned Earth
that they're coming.

163
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,216
It says here that humans

164
00:10:07,261 --> 00:10:10,359
didn't even have currency
until 5,000 years ago

165
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,930
let alone banking,
speculative investments

166
00:10:12,974 --> 00:10:14,671
or a unified global economy.

167
00:10:14,745 --> 00:10:17,513
They're a primitive,
backward people, Nog.

168
00:10:17,552 --> 00:10:18,953
Pity them.

169
00:10:18,988 --> 00:10:21,552
But think about it, Uncle...
that means they went

170
00:10:21,595 --> 00:10:23,566
from being savages
with a simple barter system

171
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,368
to leaders of a vast
interstellar Federation

172
00:10:26,407 --> 00:10:28,172
in only 5,000 years.

173
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,406
It took us twice as long

174
00:10:29,447 --> 00:10:30,643
to establish
the Ferengi Alliance

175
00:10:30,684 --> 00:10:32,347
and we had to buy
warp technology from the...

176
00:10:32,387 --> 00:10:33,355
5,000...

177
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,486
10,000...
what's the difference?

178
00:10:35,528 --> 00:10:37,726
The speed
of technological advancement

179
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:41,070
isn't nearly as important
as short-term quarterly gains.

180
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:42,908
Can't this thing go any faster?

181
00:10:42,946 --> 00:10:46,010
We're already exceeding
the safe maximum cruising speed

182
00:10:46,053 --> 00:10:47,454
by 2/10 of a warp factor.

183
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,050
Push it another tenth.

184
00:10:49,094 --> 00:10:51,361
This trip is taking
long enough as it is.

185
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,234
Relax, Brother.

186
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,967
I know kemacite is unstable

187
00:10:55,009 --> 00:10:58,210
but another day or two,
won't make any difference.

188
00:10:58,249 --> 00:10:59,650
What are you talking about?

189
00:10:59,686 --> 00:11:01,178
The shipment of kemacite

190
00:11:01,223 --> 00:11:03,717
that you're smuggling
in the cargo hold.

191
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:05,664
Uncle, are you
smuggling kemacite?

192
00:11:05,701 --> 00:11:06,897
Isn't that dangerous?

193
00:11:06,936 --> 00:11:08,964
Dangerous...
and highly profitable

194
00:11:09,008 --> 00:11:12,278
especially if we make
a side trip to Orion

195
00:11:12,316 --> 00:11:14,880
on the way home from Earth.

196
00:11:14,923 --> 00:11:16,256
What tipped you off?

197
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:18,126
When I engaged
the impulse engines

198
00:11:18,164 --> 00:11:21,228
I noticed the ship's weight
distribution was a little off

199
00:11:21,271 --> 00:11:23,708
so the last time you went
to waste extraction

200
00:11:23,744 --> 00:11:26,581
I snuck back to the cargo
bay and took a look around.

201
00:11:26,617 --> 00:11:28,280
When did you get to be so smart?

202
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:30,792
I've always been smart, Brother.

203
00:11:30,894 --> 00:11:33,161
I've just lacked
self-confidence.

204
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,367
Of course,
I could forget everything I saw.

205
00:11:36,408 --> 00:11:38,709
How much?

206
00:11:38,747 --> 00:11:42,017
20 percent of the profits.

207
00:11:42,055 --> 00:11:45,222
I suppose you'll want
a cut, too?

208
00:11:45,262 --> 00:11:47,826
As a Starfleet Cadet,
it's my duty to report

209
00:11:47,935 --> 00:11:51,398
any violation of Federation law
to my superiors immediately...

210
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,813
but then again,
I haven't been sworn in yet.

211
00:11:53,849 --> 00:11:54,817
I'll take 10 percent.

212
00:11:54,851 --> 00:11:57,415
It's a deal.

213
00:11:59,964 --> 00:12:02,162
I thought I told you
to go faster.

214
00:12:02,203 --> 00:12:05,507
Faster it is!

215
00:12:20,881 --> 00:12:22,373
Brother, wake up.

216
00:12:22,418 --> 00:12:25,084
We're approaching
Earth's star system.

217
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:27,288
Take her out of warp.

218
00:12:29,735 --> 00:12:31,603
Father, have you ever heard
of the Bell Riots?

219
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,734
Don't bother me now.

220
00:12:32,775 --> 00:12:35,269
But doesn't
this Gabriel Bell human

221
00:12:35,315 --> 00:12:36,841
look just like Captain Sisko?

222
00:12:36,886 --> 00:12:38,720
All hu-mans look alike.

223
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:41,889
I thought I told you
to take us out of warp.

224
00:12:41,998 --> 00:12:44,492
I'm trying, Brother, but
the warp core isn't responding.

225
00:12:44,537 --> 00:12:47,101
It looks like the command
sequencer has been disabled.

226
00:12:47,143 --> 00:12:50,048
I don't understand.
I tested everything!

227
00:12:50,084 --> 00:12:52,716
The only way
this could've happened is...

228
00:12:52,757 --> 00:12:56,391
if the command sequencer
was designed to fail.

229
00:12:56,432 --> 00:12:57,833
You mean sabotage.

230
00:12:57,869 --> 00:12:59,897
Cousin Gaila.

231
00:12:59,941 --> 00:13:02,105
He never did like you
very much, Uncle.

232
00:13:02,146 --> 00:13:04,276
Okay, okay, no need to panic.

233
00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:05,845
So the warp drive
won't shut down.

234
00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:07,518
What's the worst thing
that could happen?

235
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:09,051
The ship could
continue accelerating

236
00:13:09,096 --> 00:13:10,565
until it tears itself apart

237
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:13,869
and scatters our remains
halfway across the Quadrant.

238
00:13:13,908 --> 00:13:16,209
There must be something
we can do!

239
00:13:16,246 --> 00:13:17,214
Jettison the warp core?

240
00:13:17,249 --> 00:13:18,343
No, I tried that already.

241
00:13:18,385 --> 00:13:19,752
Emergency overrides are frozen.

242
00:13:19,788 --> 00:13:22,386
Then we'll have to try
something else, won't we?

243
00:13:23,564 --> 00:13:24,931
The kemacite!

244
00:13:25,034 --> 00:13:27,062
If we vent plasma
from the warp core

245
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,543
into the cargo hold,
we may be able to start

246
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:31,573
a cascade reaction
in the kemacite.

247
00:13:31,617 --> 00:13:33,952
Then we can modulate
the reaction

248
00:13:34,056 --> 00:13:35,753
to create an inversion wave

249
00:13:35,794 --> 00:13:37,697
in the warp field
and force the ship

250
00:13:37,731 --> 00:13:38,756
back into normal space!

251
00:13:38,801 --> 00:13:41,706
If I time it just right,
I should be able to get us

252
00:13:41,741 --> 00:13:44,714
close enough to Earth
to make an emergency landing!

253
00:13:44,748 --> 00:13:47,312
Rom, you're a genius!

254
00:13:48,424 --> 00:13:49,723
Think so?

255
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,127
How should I know?

256
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,362
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

257
00:13:53,402 --> 00:13:54,803
Just do it.

258
00:13:56,242 --> 00:13:58,007
Hold on!

259
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,187
Rom?

260
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,893
Nog?

261
00:14:37,534 --> 00:14:40,234
Get me General Denning.

262
00:14:40,274 --> 00:14:43,578
Tell him one
of the Martians is awake.

263
00:15:15,658 --> 00:15:17,458
We've got the farmer
who found their ship.

264
00:15:17,497 --> 00:15:18,761
He's locked up in the BOQ

265
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,294
but I don't know how much
longer we can keep him there.

266
00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:24,039
You keep him there
until I tell you to let him go.

267
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,514
Did you take care
of that idiot in Roswell

268
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:28,681
who told the press
we captured a flying saucer?

269
00:15:28,723 --> 00:15:30,921
We've convinced him
to issue a retraction.

270
00:15:30,962 --> 00:15:33,331
Turns out it was just
a weather balloon.

271
00:15:33,368 --> 00:15:34,632
Weather balloon?

272
00:15:34,671 --> 00:15:36,699
We had to come up
with something quick.

273
00:15:36,743 --> 00:15:39,716
Last thing we need is a bunch
of reporters snooping around.

274
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,382
You can't keep this from
the public forever, General.

275
00:15:42,423 --> 00:15:44,553
Beings from another planet
have landed on Earth.

276
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:46,395
This is one
of the most important events

277
00:15:46,432 --> 00:15:47,400
in human history.

278
00:15:47,435 --> 00:15:51,206
Maybe, but we can't risk
causing a panic.

279
00:15:51,244 --> 00:15:53,647
I'm not telling
the public anything

280
00:15:53,683 --> 00:15:57,124
until we find out exactly
what we're up against.

281
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,801
<i>Pip im gren tovat.</i>

282
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:03,806
<i>Yop bree</i>

283
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,902
<i>gren skin law po far.</i>

284
00:16:05,945 --> 00:16:07,346
<i>Yop im too, yoba.</i>

285
00:16:07,382 --> 00:16:09,250
<i>Yop sko ta yop ma.</i>

286
00:16:22,418 --> 00:16:25,118
It's locked.

287
00:16:25,158 --> 00:16:26,752
What is this place?

288
00:16:26,863 --> 00:16:28,332
Where are we?

289
00:16:28,366 --> 00:16:30,428
I wish you'd stop asking that.

290
00:16:30,471 --> 00:16:31,439
I told you I don't know.

291
00:16:31,473 --> 00:16:32,772
The last thing I remember

292
00:16:32,843 --> 00:16:35,748
was Father taking the shuttle
in for an emergency landing.

293
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:42,658
Well, we must be on Earth.

294
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:43,897
But where?

295
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:45,600
One thing's for sure...

296
00:16:45,641 --> 00:16:47,201
this isn't Starfleet Academy.

297
00:16:47,244 --> 00:16:49,009
I wonder what happened
to the ship.

298
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,575
My ship.

299
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,385
Where's my ship?

300
00:16:53,393 --> 00:16:54,953
Hey!

301
00:16:54,997 --> 00:16:56,968
Is anybody out there?!

302
00:16:57,002 --> 00:16:59,200
What did you do with my ship?!

303
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,205
I want my ship back!

304
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,779
<i>Goss uff wok ton!</i>
<i>Goss uff wok ton!</i>

305
00:17:05,822 --> 00:17:07,622
He's trying to break out.

306
00:17:07,661 --> 00:17:08,994
Don't let them hurt him.

307
00:17:09,031 --> 00:17:09,999
He's just scared.

308
00:17:10,033 --> 00:17:11,559
General, these creatures come

309
00:17:11,603 --> 00:17:13,904
from a race far more advanced
than our own.

310
00:17:13,941 --> 00:17:16,105
There's no telling
what they can teach us.

311
00:17:16,148 --> 00:17:18,176
We have to try
to communicate with them.

312
00:17:18,218 --> 00:17:19,312
Well, you're in luck.

313
00:17:19,355 --> 00:17:20,949
The President agrees with you

314
00:17:20,992 --> 00:17:23,020
and he wants us to try
and talk to them.

315
00:17:23,064 --> 00:17:25,262
So that's just what
you're going to do.

316
00:17:25,302 --> 00:17:26,361
Me?

317
00:17:26,405 --> 00:17:28,376
Look, Professor,
we didn't ask you here

318
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,313
just because you're
Nurse Garland's fiancé.

319
00:17:30,347 --> 00:17:33,947
I need someone
to talk to these Martians.

320
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,049
You're elected.

321
00:17:40,105 --> 00:17:42,737
I knew Earth was a bad idea.

322
00:17:42,778 --> 00:17:45,580
Ferengis and humans
have no business being together

323
00:17:45,618 --> 00:17:48,284
but you had to go
to Starfleet Academy.

324
00:17:48,325 --> 00:17:49,726
Don't blame my son.

325
00:17:49,762 --> 00:17:51,892
It was your idea
to use Gaila's shuttle.

326
00:17:51,933 --> 00:17:53,425
And you were the one
who said it was safe.

327
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,803
Leave him alone!

328
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,004
If it wasn't for my father,
we'd all be dead.

329
00:17:57,045 --> 00:17:58,013
Maybe we are dead.

330
00:17:58,047 --> 00:17:59,448
What are you talking about?

331
00:17:59,484 --> 00:18:00,919
Maybe this is
the Divine Treasury.

332
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,982
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

333
00:18:03,026 --> 00:18:05,863
The Divine Treasury
is made of pure latinum.

334
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,532
Besides, where's
the Blessed Exchequer?

335
00:18:08,573 --> 00:18:11,044
Where are
the Celestial Auctioneers?

336
00:18:11,078 --> 00:18:14,017
And why aren't we bidding
for our new lives, hmm?

337
00:18:14,053 --> 00:18:16,251
You don't think
we're in the other place?

338
00:18:16,292 --> 00:18:18,286
The Vault
of Eternal Destitution?

339
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,594
Don't be ridiculous.

340
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:21,933
The bar was showing a profit.

341
00:18:37,776 --> 00:18:41,946
Welcome to Earth.

342
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,048
We mean you no harm.

343
00:18:44,092 --> 00:18:47,430
We're sorry we had to separate

344
00:18:47,466 --> 00:18:49,960
you from your ship,
but I'm sure you can

345
00:18:50,072 --> 00:18:54,174
understand we have
lots of questions for you.

346
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,913
Did you understand
a word of that?

347
00:18:55,953 --> 00:18:59,017
Our universal translators
must be malfunctioning.

348
00:19:04,507 --> 00:19:05,942
What are they doing?

349
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,707
Maybe it's some kind
of greeting.

350
00:19:07,748 --> 00:19:09,115
She may be onto...

351
00:19:09,152 --> 00:19:11,248
...something.

352
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:17,463
What are they doing?

353
00:19:17,504 --> 00:19:21,240
Maybe their universal
translators are broken, too.

354
00:19:21,281 --> 00:19:23,275
No! They don't have
universal translators.

355
00:19:23,318 --> 00:19:24,753
I recognize those uniforms

356
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:27,352
from my guidebook, they're
from the 20th century.

357
00:19:27,395 --> 00:19:28,454
The 20th century?!

358
00:19:28,498 --> 00:19:30,526
You mean we traveled
back through time?

359
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,800
More than 400 years!

360
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:33,308
Those are military uniforms

361
00:19:33,342 --> 00:19:35,142
from one
of the old nation states.

362
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,378
Uh... Australia or something.

363
00:19:37,419 --> 00:19:39,549
So if they don't have
universal translators

364
00:19:39,591 --> 00:19:41,721
then why are they
banging their heads?

365
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,412
They're just mimicking us.

366
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:08,417
<i>Brik yop tal hopdrew,</i>
<i>ki los hoem bog?</i>

367
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,094
I think he likes you,
Captain.

368
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:15,301
I'd always heard primitive
humans lacked intelligence

369
00:20:15,343 --> 00:20:17,644
but I had no idea
they were this stupid.

370
00:20:17,682 --> 00:20:19,049
They weren't just stupid.

371
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:21,522
They were violent, petty,
bigoted and selfish.

372
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:23,118
And we're stuck here with them.

373
00:20:23,229 --> 00:20:25,666
Maybe for the rest of our lives.

374
00:20:25,702 --> 00:20:30,646
The three of us and millions
of primitive hu-mans.

375
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,676
I like those odds.

376
00:20:54,571 --> 00:20:57,305
<i>Gren fatarik oo-mox?</i>

377
00:20:57,344 --> 00:20:59,542
<i>Ya ta fa.</i>

378
00:21:02,991 --> 00:21:05,964
I've given them every
medical test I can think of

379
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:08,630
but the only thing
I can tell you for sure

380
00:21:08,671 --> 00:21:10,004
is they're not human.

381
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:11,601
Well, that's a start.

382
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,707
I think these two are involved

383
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,185
in some kind
of a grooming ritual.

384
00:21:15,254 --> 00:21:16,187
Look how the older one

385
00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:17,519
is taking care
of the younger one.

386
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:18,653
That's sweet.

387
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:20,893
Maybe they're father and son.

388
00:21:20,934 --> 00:21:22,768
Wouldn't that be something?

389
00:21:22,804 --> 00:21:25,436
They've come from so far away,
but they still have

390
00:21:25,478 --> 00:21:28,076
the same basic family
structure that we do.

391
00:21:28,118 --> 00:21:30,555
I wonder if the third one's
related, too.

392
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,430
For all we know,
it could be the mother.

393
00:21:32,563 --> 00:21:34,727
<i>Gren fa hoe loth pex-pil?!</i>

394
00:21:34,768 --> 00:21:38,938
If she is the mother,
she's quite a shrew.

395
00:21:38,979 --> 00:21:40,779
I'm working as fast
as I can, Brother

396
00:21:40,817 --> 00:21:42,913
but there must be
some kind of interference

397
00:21:42,955 --> 00:21:44,288
disrupting our translators.

398
00:21:45,628 --> 00:21:47,222
What kind of interference?

399
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:48,496
I'm not sure.

400
00:21:48,535 --> 00:21:52,568
Could be solar flares,
or maybe ionic interference

401
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:55,082
or I suppose it could be
beta radiation

402
00:21:55,118 --> 00:21:57,920
but that's only produced
by nuclear fission.

403
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,518
Don't be an idiot.

404
00:21:59,562 --> 00:22:03,025
Nuclear fission doesn't happen
within planetary atmospheres.

405
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,266
It does here.

406
00:22:04,306 --> 00:22:06,071
In the 20th century, humans used

407
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,978
crude nuclear reactors
as weapons.

408
00:22:08,015 --> 00:22:09,575
They called them "atom bombs."

409
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,852
They used to blow
them up all the time.

410
00:22:11,891 --> 00:22:15,388
They irradiated
their own planet?

411
00:22:15,433 --> 00:22:16,959
If Nog says so, they did.

412
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:18,871
He knows all about
Earth history.

413
00:22:18,908 --> 00:22:20,708
You better fix
those translators fast.

414
00:22:20,745 --> 00:22:22,807
The sooner we start talking
to these savages

415
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,844
the better off we'll be.

416
00:22:29,232 --> 00:22:31,669
<i>Vo yop toe pah?</i>

417
00:22:33,476 --> 00:22:36,574
He seems to want something
from you.

418
00:22:36,617 --> 00:22:39,522
You'd better tell him
I'm your girl.

419
00:22:39,557 --> 00:22:42,758
<i>Yop triska gleep</i>
<i>do-sta gren-la.</i>

420
00:22:49,213 --> 00:22:51,548
I think he wants your hairpin.

421
00:22:53,758 --> 00:22:55,854
If you say so, Professor.

422
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,594
Here you go.

423
00:23:00,774 --> 00:23:02,300
<i>Neep-gren.</i>

424
00:23:05,219 --> 00:23:07,885
Now, where's that reset button?

425
00:23:10,364 --> 00:23:12,996
Ouch!
That looks like it hurts.

426
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:14,803
Well, he doesn't seem to mind.

427
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,619
Oh...

428
00:23:19,653 --> 00:23:21,247
I wish I could get some help.

429
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:25,129
I don't know why we can't
bring in a few more experts.

430
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:26,156
Let's face it, Jeff...

431
00:23:26,202 --> 00:23:28,298
when it comes to beings
from another planet

432
00:23:28,341 --> 00:23:29,640
we don't have any experts.

433
00:23:29,677 --> 00:23:30,702
You'll find a way

434
00:23:30,746 --> 00:23:32,979
of communicating with them,
darling.

435
00:23:33,018 --> 00:23:34,077
I know you will.

436
00:23:35,758 --> 00:23:37,854
Imagine the possibilities.

437
00:23:37,897 --> 00:23:40,232
Who knows what they
could teach us?

438
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,264
A few years from now

439
00:23:42,307 --> 00:23:45,303
mankind could have
rocket ships of our own.

440
00:23:45,348 --> 00:23:48,412
We could travel the galaxy,
exploring new worlds

441
00:23:48,455 --> 00:23:50,358
and new civilizations.

442
00:23:50,394 --> 00:23:52,262
Always the dreamer.

443
00:23:52,298 --> 00:23:54,098
That's why you love me.

444
00:23:54,136 --> 00:23:55,571
It's funny, isn't it?

445
00:23:55,606 --> 00:23:57,406
Here we are in the middle

446
00:23:57,444 --> 00:24:00,417
of one of the greatest
discoveries in human history

447
00:24:00,451 --> 00:24:02,080
and all I can think about

448
00:24:02,121 --> 00:24:05,391
is what you're going to look
like in your wedding dress.

449
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:06,729
My mother keeps asking

450
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,862
where we're going
on our honeymoon.

451
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,376
She thinks we should go
to Niagara Falls.

452
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:13,974
Well, who knows?

453
00:24:14,017 --> 00:24:18,392
Maybe we'll go to Mars.

454
00:24:21,969 --> 00:24:24,270
What's that disgusting smell?

455
00:24:24,308 --> 00:24:25,937
I think it's called "tobacco."

456
00:24:25,979 --> 00:24:27,141
It's a deadly drug.

457
00:24:27,181 --> 00:24:30,348
When used frequently,
it destroys the internal organs.

458
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:32,884
If it's so deadly,
then why do they use it?

459
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,398
It's also highly addictive.

460
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:35,560
How do they get
their hands on it?

461
00:24:35,602 --> 00:24:36,935
They buy it in stores.

462
00:24:36,972 --> 00:24:38,737
They buy it?

463
00:24:38,776 --> 00:24:41,681
If they'll buy poison,
they'll buy anything.

464
00:24:41,717 --> 00:24:43,950
I think I'm going
to like it here.

465
00:24:43,989 --> 00:24:45,720
Uncle, I hope
you're not thinking

466
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:48,425
of doing anything that
will disrupt the timeline.

467
00:24:48,466 --> 00:24:49,594
Perish the thought.

468
00:24:49,636 --> 00:24:51,003
Changing the history of Earth

469
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,374
could affect the entire galaxy.

470
00:24:53,411 --> 00:24:55,848
The Federation, Deep Space 9...

471
00:24:55,917 --> 00:24:58,583
your bar... could all
cease to exist.

472
00:24:58,623 --> 00:24:59,956
Wouldn't that be a shame?

473
00:24:59,994 --> 00:25:02,022
Rom, hurry up
with those translators.

474
00:25:04,939 --> 00:25:07,468
The alien ship has a small
control area in the front

475
00:25:07,512 --> 00:25:09,745
and rudimentary
sleeping quarters in the back.

476
00:25:09,784 --> 00:25:12,518
So far, we can't even figure out
what drives the engines

477
00:25:12,557 --> 00:25:13,787
let alone how they work.

478
00:25:15,163 --> 00:25:17,795
Hey, how you doing, big fella?

479
00:25:17,836 --> 00:25:20,570
You making any headway,
Professor?

480
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:21,578
It's fascinating.

481
00:25:21,612 --> 00:25:23,172
I would've expected creatures

482
00:25:23,216 --> 00:25:25,187
of their technological
sophistication

483
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,057
to communicate telepathically,
but they seem to have

484
00:25:28,094 --> 00:25:30,395
a structured verbal language
just like we do.

485
00:25:30,434 --> 00:25:31,562
Given enough time

486
00:25:31,602 --> 00:25:34,370
a good team of linguists
could probably decipher it.

487
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:36,174
We're not bringing in
anyone else.

488
00:25:36,214 --> 00:25:38,412
Too many people
know about this as it is.

489
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:40,150
Besides, we don't have the time.

490
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,593
President Truman's
an impatient man.

491
00:25:42,629 --> 00:25:45,158
He wants answers
and he wants them now.

492
00:25:45,202 --> 00:25:46,569
Jeff, General Denning

493
00:25:46,605 --> 00:25:49,237
I think you'd better come inside
right away.

494
00:25:56,897 --> 00:25:59,836
My name is Quark,
Chief Financial Officer

495
00:25:59,871 --> 00:26:01,705
of the Ferengi Alliance

496
00:26:01,741 --> 00:26:05,648
and... I've got
a business proposition for you.

497
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:16,737
I don't see
any universal translator.

498
00:26:16,777 --> 00:26:18,645
Trust me.
It's in there.

499
00:26:18,682 --> 00:26:19,912
So this gadget of yours is

500
00:26:19,952 --> 00:26:22,355
what makes it possible for us
to understand each other?

501
00:26:22,391 --> 00:26:23,553
How's it work?

502
00:26:23,594 --> 00:26:26,294
It's simple if you know how.

503
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,328
You'd be surprised at the kind
of things you can do

504
00:26:28,372 --> 00:26:29,773
with the right technology.

505
00:26:29,809 --> 00:26:31,335
Which brings me
to why I'm here.

506
00:26:31,379 --> 00:26:32,746
I was wondering about that.

507
00:26:32,783 --> 00:26:36,315
I've been sent by my people
to open up a market

508
00:26:36,358 --> 00:26:38,522
for advanced Ferengi technology.

509
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:40,966
What kind of technology
you talking about?

510
00:26:41,035 --> 00:26:43,735
How would you like to travel
beyond the stars

511
00:26:43,775 --> 00:26:45,746
at speeds you never even dreamt
were possible?

512
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:48,412
Or to transport yourselves
from one place to another

513
00:26:48,454 --> 00:26:49,684
in the blink of an eye?

514
00:26:49,723 --> 00:26:50,713
You know how to do that?

515
00:26:51,728 --> 00:26:52,924
That's only the beginning.

516
00:26:52,964 --> 00:26:55,333
We can give you
the medical knowledge

517
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:57,364
to cure your deadliest diseases.

518
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,709
We have machines that can
produce food and clothing

519
00:26:59,747 --> 00:27:01,080
out of thin air.

520
00:27:01,117 --> 00:27:02,085
What about weapons?

521
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,282
Weapons?!

522
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:05,555
If you want weapons,
I'm the man to see.

523
00:27:05,595 --> 00:27:08,865
We could teach you to
make phasers, disruptors

524
00:27:08,902 --> 00:27:13,106
photon torpedoes...
or even quantum torpedoes...

525
00:27:13,146 --> 00:27:15,447
a little more expensive
but worth it.

526
00:27:15,484 --> 00:27:16,452
What do you want in return?

527
00:27:16,487 --> 00:27:17,786
That depends.

528
00:27:17,824 --> 00:27:20,558
What do you use
for currency around here...

529
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,898
latinum, dilithium?

530
00:27:22,936 --> 00:27:24,200
We use dollars.

531
00:27:24,239 --> 00:27:26,642
Dollars?
Never heard of them.

532
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:28,842
Don't you have any gemstones
or precious minerals?

533
00:27:28,883 --> 00:27:30,113
You mean like gold?

534
00:27:30,153 --> 00:27:31,121
Gold is good.

535
00:27:31,155 --> 00:27:32,522
How much gold
are we talking about?

536
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,030
Seeing how were going to be
advancing your culture

537
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:38,505
about 400 years
overnight, I'd say

538
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,704
a couple of million bars
would be about right...

539
00:27:40,746 --> 00:27:42,010
as a good faith deposit.

540
00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:45,353
You know, Quark, you might be
some kind of Martian...

541
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:46,791
Ferengi.

542
00:27:46,826 --> 00:27:48,820
Whatever, but the more we talk

543
00:27:48,865 --> 00:27:51,861
the more you remind me
of my brother-in-law.

544
00:27:51,905 --> 00:27:53,067
Is he a businessman?

545
00:27:53,108 --> 00:27:55,238
He's a car salesman
and not a very good one.

546
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,251
Then he's nothing like me.

547
00:27:57,285 --> 00:28:00,417
The bottom line is,
I don't trust him

548
00:28:00,459 --> 00:28:01,894
and I don't trust you.

549
00:28:01,929 --> 00:28:04,595
So before we sit down
and sign any contracts

550
00:28:04,636 --> 00:28:05,730
you are going to tell me

551
00:28:05,772 --> 00:28:08,209
just what the hell you people
are really doing here.

552
00:28:08,244 --> 00:28:09,212
I just told you.

553
00:28:09,247 --> 00:28:11,811
We're here to open up
trade negotiations.

554
00:28:11,853 --> 00:28:14,051
If you're not interested,
just say so.

555
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,719
I'm sure I can do business

556
00:28:15,763 --> 00:28:18,565
with one of your planet's
other nation states.

557
00:28:18,603 --> 00:28:20,801
In other words, if we don't
play ball, you're going to sell

558
00:28:20,842 --> 00:28:22,642
these advanced weapons of yours
to the Russians.

559
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:25,173
I'd rather
it didn't come to that.

560
00:28:25,219 --> 00:28:29,559
To be honest, I'd much rather
work with you Australians.

561
00:28:29,596 --> 00:28:30,495
Americans.

562
00:28:30,531 --> 00:28:32,000
Whatever.

563
00:28:32,034 --> 00:28:35,098
But, if you won't do business
with me and the Russians will

564
00:28:35,142 --> 00:28:37,238
who am I to say no?

565
00:28:37,281 --> 00:28:39,309
I-I'm not saying
we can't do business

566
00:28:39,353 --> 00:28:41,985
but I don't have the authority
to make this kind of decision.

567
00:28:42,025 --> 00:28:43,551
I'll have to get, uh...

568
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:45,567
Well, I'll have to get clearance
from the President.

569
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,446
I can wait.

570
00:28:49,888 --> 00:28:52,918
In the meantime,
let me give you some free advice

571
00:28:52,962 --> 00:28:55,024
just to show you
I'm on your side.

572
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:58,097
You people should
take better care of yourselves.

573
00:28:58,141 --> 00:29:00,578
Stop poisoning your bodies
with tobacco

574
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,675
and atom bombs.

575
00:29:02,718 --> 00:29:05,748
Sooner or later, that kind
of stuff will kill you.

576
00:29:05,793 --> 00:29:08,493
What do you know
about atom bombs?

577
00:29:08,533 --> 00:29:11,597
My people have been watching
your world for years.

578
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,702
We know all about you...

579
00:29:13,745 --> 00:29:19,123
baseball, root beer,
darts, atom bombs.

580
00:29:19,158 --> 00:29:23,396
It's quite a fascinating culture
you hu-mans have here.

581
00:29:23,435 --> 00:29:26,272
And with a little
Ferengi technology

582
00:29:26,308 --> 00:29:28,108
it could be even better.

583
00:29:28,146 --> 00:29:33,147
Now, why don't you go talk
to that President of yours?

584
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,052
Let me get this straight, Rom.

585
00:29:47,091 --> 00:29:49,085
Are you saying that all
the women on your world

586
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,759
walk around naked?

587
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:53,864
Uh-huh.
It's the law.

588
00:29:53,941 --> 00:29:56,139
You don't say.

589
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,709
Well, I guess I'm never going
to visit your world.

590
00:29:58,753 --> 00:30:00,086
And neither are you.

591
00:30:00,123 --> 00:30:02,219
Uh, Nurse Garland...

592
00:30:02,262 --> 00:30:04,096
I'm having trouble
with my ear again.

593
00:30:04,132 --> 00:30:05,726
Could you massage it some more?

594
00:30:07,942 --> 00:30:10,413
Are you sure you don't want
a Doctor to look at that?

595
00:30:10,448 --> 00:30:13,285
No. I feel more
comfortable with you.

596
00:30:13,321 --> 00:30:17,320
Ah... ah...

597
00:30:17,364 --> 00:30:18,731
Much better.

598
00:30:18,768 --> 00:30:23,872
You know, come to think of it,
my ear's bothering me, too.

599
00:30:25,117 --> 00:30:26,586
Brother!

600
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,351
How did your meeting
with the General go?

601
00:30:31,499 --> 00:30:33,264
It's... late.

602
00:30:33,302 --> 00:30:34,896
We should let you get some rest.

603
00:30:36,176 --> 00:30:37,235
I'm not tired!

604
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,341
We'll visit some more tomorrow.

605
00:30:40,686 --> 00:30:43,990
There's something about
that female that I don't like.

606
00:30:44,095 --> 00:30:47,000
She's so... cheerful.

607
00:30:47,102 --> 00:30:48,435
What about the General?

608
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:49,998
Is he going to let us leave?

609
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,409
Don't worry.

610
00:30:51,445 --> 00:30:53,005
Everything's under control.

611
00:30:56,157 --> 00:30:59,529
Oh, they forgot
to take that thing with them.

612
00:31:04,109 --> 00:31:07,082
It seems to like you, Brother.

613
00:31:07,116 --> 00:31:09,349
Get away from me.

614
00:31:11,227 --> 00:31:14,200
Hello, Quark.

615
00:31:14,234 --> 00:31:17,264
Odo, what are you doing here?

616
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:20,406
Placing you under arrest for
attempting to smuggle kemacite.

617
00:31:20,449 --> 00:31:22,180
Did you really
expect me to believe

618
00:31:22,219 --> 00:31:24,452
that you were traveling
all the way to Earth

619
00:31:24,492 --> 00:31:26,018
just to be nice to your nephew?

620
00:31:26,129 --> 00:31:27,758
You hid on board the ship.

621
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:28,858
That's right.

622
00:31:28,903 --> 00:31:30,806
And now I'm stuck
here with you.

623
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,038
Now listen carefully, because we
don't have much time.

624
00:31:33,146 --> 00:31:34,980
Someone could come in
any minute.

625
00:31:35,017 --> 00:31:38,856
Your ship is in a hangar
on the other side of the base.

626
00:31:38,893 --> 00:31:40,830
It sustained some damage
in the crash

627
00:31:40,864 --> 00:31:42,858
but the engines
are still functioning.

628
00:31:42,902 --> 00:31:44,565
If we're lucky,
we should be able

629
00:31:44,607 --> 00:31:46,270
to use it to get away from here.

630
00:31:46,311 --> 00:31:47,405
And go where?

631
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,541
Even if we get out of here

632
00:31:48,582 --> 00:31:51,384
we'll still going to be trapped
400 years in the past.

633
00:31:51,423 --> 00:31:52,722
Actually, I've been thinking.

634
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:54,559
If there's enough
kemacite left

635
00:31:54,597 --> 00:31:56,659
there might be a way to
get back to our own time.

636
00:31:56,703 --> 00:31:57,398
How?

637
00:31:57,438 --> 00:31:58,771
If we find

638
00:31:58,808 --> 00:32:01,302
a sufficiently
powerful energy source

639
00:32:01,347 --> 00:32:03,648
we should be able
to trigger a temporal surge

640
00:32:03,685 --> 00:32:04,984
in the subspace continuum

641
00:32:05,022 --> 00:32:06,822
and recreate
the same kind of time warp

642
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,454
that brought us here
in the first place!

643
00:32:08,497 --> 00:32:09,465
What do you mean by

644
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,300
"a sufficiently
powerful energy source?"

645
00:32:11,337 --> 00:32:12,704
We're not going anywhere.

646
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:14,438
We're staying right here.

647
00:32:14,478 --> 00:32:16,243
But, Brother,
what about the bar?

648
00:32:16,282 --> 00:32:18,047
Who cares about the bar?

649
00:32:18,087 --> 00:32:20,524
I'm telling you, Rom,
we stay here

650
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,330
and inside of a year,
we'll be running this place.

651
00:32:24,368 --> 00:32:26,099
You mean the military base?

652
00:32:26,173 --> 00:32:27,802
I mean the whole planet.

653
00:32:27,843 --> 00:32:28,811
Huh!

654
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:30,338
"Harumph" all you want.

655
00:32:30,383 --> 00:32:32,513
But these hu-mans...
they're nothing

656
00:32:32,555 --> 00:32:34,719
like the ones
from the Federation.

657
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,326
They're crude,
gullible and greedy.

658
00:32:38,369 --> 00:32:39,770
You mean like you.

659
00:32:39,806 --> 00:32:45,012
Yeah. These are humans
I can understand and manipulate.

660
00:32:45,051 --> 00:32:47,580
But, Uncle, what
about the timeline?

661
00:32:47,624 --> 00:32:48,854
Forget this timeline.

662
00:32:48,894 --> 00:32:51,365
The one we're going to create
will be better.

663
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,394
Once we get things in order here

664
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:54,805
we'll contact
the Ferengi homeworld

665
00:32:54,842 --> 00:32:56,813
and sell them our ship.

666
00:32:56,847 --> 00:32:59,649
The Ferengi will have
warp drive technology

667
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:04,289
centuries before hu-mans
or Klingons or even the Vulcans.

668
00:33:04,331 --> 00:33:06,963
We'll establish
an economic empire

669
00:33:07,004 --> 00:33:10,000
beyond even Grand Nagus Zek's
wildest dreams

670
00:33:10,044 --> 00:33:12,311
and I'll control it all.

671
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:15,346
You do have a vivid imagination

672
00:33:15,391 --> 00:33:19,025
but the only place we're going
is back to our own time.

673
00:33:19,066 --> 00:33:21,128
I'll have the ship
ready to go in six hours

674
00:33:21,172 --> 00:33:24,840
and you're all
going to be on it.

675
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:29,289
I'm not going back,
and neither is my ship.

676
00:33:29,324 --> 00:33:31,488
We'll see about that.

677
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:54,918
What's the word, General?

678
00:33:54,952 --> 00:33:56,889
That little
piano-playing Democrat's

679
00:33:56,924 --> 00:33:58,257
not as dumb as he looks.

680
00:33:58,294 --> 00:34:00,892
He's not about to make a deal
with these aliens

681
00:34:00,933 --> 00:34:02,197
until we learn more about them.

682
00:34:02,303 --> 00:34:04,331
And how does the President
propose we do that?

683
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,939
He said he'd leave that
in our capable hands.

684
00:34:06,981 --> 00:34:08,541
Don't worry, General.

685
00:34:08,585 --> 00:34:10,613
I'll find out
what those Martians are up to.

686
00:34:10,657 --> 00:34:12,855
See that you do.

687
00:34:19,044 --> 00:34:21,915
This is the opportunity
of a lifetime.

688
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:23,146
I don't know, Brother.

689
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,780
It seems awfully risky to me.

690
00:34:24,824 --> 00:34:27,797
The riskier the road,
the greater the profit.

691
00:34:27,831 --> 00:34:30,929
What about Rule
of Acquisition 203?

692
00:34:30,971 --> 00:34:33,876
"New customers are like
razor-toothed gree-worms.

693
00:34:33,912 --> 00:34:37,079
They can be succulent,
but sometimes they bite back."

694
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,282
No...

695
00:34:38,323 --> 00:34:40,624
if there's any biting to be done

696
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:43,396
we're the ones who are
going to do it, huh?

697
00:34:52,289 --> 00:34:53,883
Get this off me.

698
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:55,225
Get this off me!

699
00:34:55,263 --> 00:34:56,596
I can't breathe!

700
00:34:56,633 --> 00:34:57,795
This is an outrage!

701
00:34:57,836 --> 00:34:59,864
I demand to see General Denning.

702
00:34:59,908 --> 00:35:01,571
If I don't get satisfaction

703
00:35:01,612 --> 00:35:04,049
I'm taking my business
to the Russians.

704
00:35:04,085 --> 00:35:05,554
The Russians...

705
00:35:05,588 --> 00:35:08,288
that's a good place to start.

706
00:35:08,328 --> 00:35:13,170
Why don't you tell me everything
you know about the Russians?

707
00:35:31,973 --> 00:35:34,342
Would you please
stop doing that?

708
00:35:34,379 --> 00:35:36,076
That's the fifth injection

709
00:35:36,116 --> 00:35:38,110
of sodium Pentothal
I've given him.

710
00:35:38,154 --> 00:35:39,623
It's not working.

711
00:35:39,658 --> 00:35:42,426
Their biochemistry
is obviously nothing like ours.

712
00:35:42,465 --> 00:35:45,461
Then stop sticking me
with those needles!

713
00:35:45,506 --> 00:35:46,736
Captain, this is wrong.

714
00:35:46,808 --> 00:35:48,402
These people are our guests.

715
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:49,414
They're not people.

716
00:35:49,448 --> 00:35:50,849
They're... things.

717
00:35:50,885 --> 00:35:54,291
Invaders from another world.

718
00:35:54,327 --> 00:35:58,326
It's up to us to put an end
to whatever they're planning.

719
00:35:58,369 --> 00:36:01,501
Now, if you don't tell me
what I want to know

720
00:36:01,544 --> 00:36:03,640
needles are going to be

721
00:36:03,682 --> 00:36:05,744
the least of your worries.

722
00:36:09,763 --> 00:36:12,098
You know, Doc

723
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:16,442
I've always wanted to see
what a Martian looked like...

724
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,644
from the inside.

725
00:36:19,487 --> 00:36:20,455
Don't you people

726
00:36:20,489 --> 00:36:21,981
have laws against
this kind of thing?

727
00:36:22,027 --> 00:36:25,057
Not when it comes
to national security.

728
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,438
Now, which one
should we start with?

729
00:36:28,475 --> 00:36:30,912
The loud one?

730
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,751
The little one...

731
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:38,425
or the quiet one?

732
00:36:38,466 --> 00:36:42,465
Now why don't you tell us
why you're really here?

733
00:36:42,508 --> 00:36:43,738
It was an accident.

734
00:36:43,778 --> 00:36:45,008
We're from the future.

735
00:36:45,048 --> 00:36:46,745
The warp core was sabotaged.

736
00:36:46,785 --> 00:36:48,653
It's all Cousin Gaila's fault.

737
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:50,387
I want to go home!

738
00:36:50,427 --> 00:36:52,364
I want my Moogie!

739
00:36:52,399 --> 00:36:54,233
Moogie?

740
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:55,260
You want the truth?

741
00:36:55,306 --> 00:36:56,673
I'll tell you the truth.

742
00:36:56,709 --> 00:36:59,409
We're advance scouts
for the Ferengi invasion fleet.

743
00:36:59,449 --> 00:37:00,417
I knew it!

744
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:02,945
Nog, what are you talking about?

745
00:37:02,991 --> 00:37:04,962
We've been studying you puny
Earthlings for centuries

746
00:37:04,996 --> 00:37:06,556
and you're ripe for conquest.

747
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,571
It's not true!

748
00:37:08,605 --> 00:37:09,767
Moogie!

749
00:37:09,807 --> 00:37:11,276
It's no use, Supreme Commander.

750
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:12,609
They've seen through our cover

751
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:15,745
but knowing our plans
won't do them any good.

752
00:37:15,789 --> 00:37:17,760
Even now, 300 Marauder-class

753
00:37:17,794 --> 00:37:19,992
attack cruisers
are orbiting your planet

754
00:37:20,032 --> 00:37:21,695
preparing for the attack.

755
00:37:21,736 --> 00:37:23,604
Moogie!

756
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:25,509
I'm telling you this is crazy!

757
00:37:25,545 --> 00:37:27,037
Nog, tell him the truth.

758
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:29,054
We're helpless.
We're harmless.

759
00:37:29,087 --> 00:37:31,115
We just want to sell you things.

760
00:37:31,158 --> 00:37:33,790
Captain, I'm not sure
I believe this invasion story.

761
00:37:33,832 --> 00:37:36,430
You scientists.

762
00:37:36,472 --> 00:37:37,839
You're like children...

763
00:37:37,875 --> 00:37:41,509
always walking around
with your heads in the clouds.

764
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,849
Keep talking.

765
00:37:42,887 --> 00:37:46,328
When the appointed hour arrives,
the Marauders will deactivate

766
00:37:46,361 --> 00:37:47,887
their cloaking devices
and begin

767
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:50,061
transporting
Klingon shock troops

768
00:37:50,104 --> 00:37:51,904
directly to the landing zone.

769
00:37:51,975 --> 00:37:53,239
Landing zone?

770
00:37:53,278 --> 00:37:54,804
Where? Tell me.

771
00:37:54,848 --> 00:37:56,147
Why not?

772
00:37:56,185 --> 00:37:58,588
Your feeble weapons
will be useless against us.

773
00:37:58,625 --> 00:38:01,826
We will kill all your males
and take your females

774
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:03,425
to mate with.

775
00:38:03,469 --> 00:38:04,870
Where's the landing zone?

776
00:38:04,906 --> 00:38:08,038
Untie me and I will show you
on that map.

777
00:38:09,149 --> 00:38:10,482
You heard him.

778
00:38:13,126 --> 00:38:14,493
Go get General Denning.

779
00:38:14,529 --> 00:38:18,334
Tell him he was right
about the Martians all along.

780
00:38:19,675 --> 00:38:21,008
Show me.

781
00:38:25,255 --> 00:38:27,887
The first landing parties
will arrive here.

782
00:38:27,928 --> 00:38:29,261
Where?

783
00:38:29,297 --> 00:38:31,097
Here.
Right by this blue blob.

784
00:38:31,135 --> 00:38:34,108
You mean your people
are going to invade...

785
00:38:34,142 --> 00:38:35,338
Cleveland?

786
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:36,347
No, not Cleveland.

787
00:38:36,381 --> 00:38:37,371
Right... here!

788
00:38:38,419 --> 00:38:39,945
Hold it!

789
00:38:40,625 --> 00:38:41,593
Don't hurt him.

790
00:38:41,628 --> 00:38:44,065
It was an accident.
I tripped.

791
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,364
I didn't mean to do it.

792
00:38:45,403 --> 00:38:46,371
I'm really, really sorry.

793
00:38:46,405 --> 00:38:47,395
Shoot him!

794
00:38:50,348 --> 00:38:51,476
Thank you.

795
00:38:51,518 --> 00:38:52,486
We're all grateful

796
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,388
but couldn't you have
done that an hour ago?

797
00:38:54,425 --> 00:38:55,655
We've got to get
you out of here.

798
00:38:55,694 --> 00:38:57,494
Won't you get
in trouble for this?

799
00:38:58,501 --> 00:38:59,663
Why should they?

800
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:03,509
We forced them to help us
by using our, uh...

801
00:39:03,546 --> 00:39:06,678
Your insidious
mind control powers.

802
00:39:06,721 --> 00:39:08,919
That's not bad.

803
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,954
For a primitive female,
she's pretty smart.

804
00:39:10,998 --> 00:39:12,433
Come on.

805
00:39:12,468 --> 00:39:14,233
Your ship's in Hangar 18.

806
00:39:14,272 --> 00:39:15,297
Come on.

807
00:39:20,387 --> 00:39:22,187
Captain Wainwright
needs to see you

808
00:39:22,224 --> 00:39:23,454
in Examination Room 3.

809
00:39:30,711 --> 00:39:32,545
Hold it right there.

810
00:39:33,585 --> 00:39:35,179
Stay back...

811
00:39:35,223 --> 00:39:38,219
or I'll disintegrate
this hostage.

812
00:39:38,263 --> 00:39:39,527
With your finger?

813
00:39:39,566 --> 00:39:41,537
With my death ray.

814
00:39:41,571 --> 00:39:44,203
Looks a lot like a finger to me.

815
00:39:49,222 --> 00:39:50,521
Who's he?

816
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:52,928
My hero.

817
00:39:52,964 --> 00:39:55,435
Can we please leave now?

818
00:40:08,135 --> 00:40:09,399
You're sure they're going

819
00:40:09,437 --> 00:40:11,100
to be detonating
an atomic bomb today?

820
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:12,667
That's what it said
in the papers.

821
00:40:12,712 --> 00:40:14,477
5:00 AM at the proving
grounds in Nevada.

822
00:40:14,517 --> 00:40:15,816
But I don't see
how an atomic bomb

823
00:40:15,853 --> 00:40:17,117
is going to help you
to get home.

824
00:40:17,189 --> 00:40:18,122
It's simple.

825
00:40:18,192 --> 00:40:20,026
We need to harness
the beta radiation

826
00:40:20,063 --> 00:40:21,327
to trigger a cascade...

827
00:40:21,366 --> 00:40:22,494
Save your breath.

828
00:40:22,536 --> 00:40:24,905
It's much too complicated
for them to grasp.

829
00:40:24,941 --> 00:40:26,741
5:00 AM... that's
seven minutes from now.

830
00:40:26,779 --> 00:40:27,747
Don't worry.

831
00:40:27,781 --> 00:40:28,943
We'll get there.

832
00:40:28,985 --> 00:40:30,284
Thanks for your help.

833
00:40:30,321 --> 00:40:32,519
You may be hu-mans,
but you're okay by me.

834
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,961
You don't have to thank us.

835
00:40:33,997 --> 00:40:35,022
I only hope that one day

836
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:36,694
mankind will travel
to the stars

837
00:40:36,737 --> 00:40:39,106
and take its place in
a vast alliance of planets.

838
00:40:39,142 --> 00:40:41,170
Federation of planets.

839
00:40:41,214 --> 00:40:42,547
Excuse me?

840
00:40:42,584 --> 00:40:44,555
Uh, don't pay
any attention to him.

841
00:40:44,589 --> 00:40:45,614
He's an idiot.

842
00:40:45,658 --> 00:40:47,526
Trust me, the galaxy
is a pretty rough place.

843
00:40:47,563 --> 00:40:50,092
You people are much better off
staying right here on Earth.

844
00:40:50,135 --> 00:40:51,331
Let's go, Quark.

845
00:40:59,157 --> 00:41:01,458
"A vast alliance of planets."

846
00:41:01,495 --> 00:41:03,898
You get the craziest ideas.

847
00:41:23,983 --> 00:41:26,420
What do we do now, General?

848
00:41:26,455 --> 00:41:28,152
About what, Captain?

849
00:41:28,193 --> 00:41:32,226
All we ever found
was a crashed weather balloon.

850
00:41:35,277 --> 00:41:36,507
Now, tell me again.

851
00:41:36,546 --> 00:41:38,881
What's going to happen
when we get there?

852
00:41:38,919 --> 00:41:40,856
We fly straight
into the atomic explosion

853
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:43,384
expose the kemacite
to the beta radiation

854
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:45,161
and engage the warp engines.

855
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,832
If we have enough kemacite,
we should be able

856
00:41:47,873 --> 00:41:50,744
to create a reverse time warp
and ride it home.

857
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,978
My dad... always thinking.

858
00:41:53,019 --> 00:41:54,511
If this doesn't work

859
00:41:54,556 --> 00:41:57,529
I'm holding you
personally responsible.

860
00:41:57,564 --> 00:42:00,662
I don't remember inviting
you on this trip.

861
00:42:00,704 --> 00:42:02,643
We're at the target site.

862
00:42:02,776 --> 00:42:04,747
Hold on.

863
00:42:13,302 --> 00:42:16,469
I don't like this!

864
00:42:16,509 --> 00:42:19,038
Rom, tell your brother
it's going to be all right.

865
00:42:19,149 --> 00:42:22,281
It's going to be all right,
Brother.

866
00:42:22,323 --> 00:42:23,313
I hope.

867
00:42:42,539 --> 00:42:44,510
Did we make it?

868
00:42:44,543 --> 00:42:47,037
This doesn't look
like the Divine Treasury.

869
00:42:47,082 --> 00:42:48,312
What year is this?

870
00:42:48,352 --> 00:42:49,320
Good question.

871
00:42:49,354 --> 00:42:51,825
What's that flashing indicator?

872
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:53,592
We're being hailed!

873
00:42:53,631 --> 00:42:55,100
Answer them, answer them!

874
00:42:56,338 --> 00:42:57,602
This is Earth Orbital Control

875
00:42:57,641 --> 00:42:59,942
to the unidentified
Ferengi vessel.

876
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,472
Do you need assistance?

877
00:43:01,517 --> 00:43:02,645
Yes! Definitely!

878
00:43:02,687 --> 00:43:06,789
We'll send a ship to tractor you
to a docking facility.

879
00:43:06,829 --> 00:43:08,196
We'll be waiting.

880
00:43:08,233 --> 00:43:11,104
Well, son,
it looks like you're

881
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:13,111
going to get to Starfleet
Academy after all.

882
00:43:13,211 --> 00:43:15,341
Just remember...

883
00:43:15,383 --> 00:43:17,616
under that placid
Federation veneer

884
00:43:17,656 --> 00:43:20,220
humans are still
a bunch of violent savages.

885
00:43:20,262 --> 00:43:23,634
Maybe... but I like them.

886
00:43:34,229 --> 00:43:35,960
Oh, it's good to be home.

887
00:43:35,999 --> 00:43:38,470
I bet you can't wait
to see the bar again.

888
00:43:38,506 --> 00:43:39,474
The bar?

889
00:43:39,508 --> 00:43:40,567
I could have ruled the galaxy.

890
00:43:40,611 --> 00:43:42,012
But now I have nothing.

891
00:43:42,048 --> 00:43:44,144
I don't even have
my ship anymore.

892
00:43:44,186 --> 00:43:45,485
Look on the bright side,
Brother.

893
00:43:45,523 --> 00:43:48,087
You may have had to sell
your shuttle for salvage

894
00:43:48,128 --> 00:43:50,760
but at least you got enough
for our passage home.

895
00:43:50,802 --> 00:43:52,932
Wait till I get my
hands on Cousin Gaila.

896
00:43:52,974 --> 00:43:54,774
You're going to have
to wait longer than you think.

897
00:43:54,812 --> 00:43:55,780
Let's go.

898
00:43:55,814 --> 00:43:57,215
What are you doing?

899
00:43:57,317 --> 00:43:58,877
Taking you to a holding cell.

900
00:43:58,921 --> 00:44:01,119
Kemacite smuggling
is a serious offense.

901
00:44:01,159 --> 00:44:02,753
But you have no evidence.

902
00:44:02,797 --> 00:44:04,494
We used all the rest
of the kemacite

903
00:44:04,534 --> 00:44:06,299
to get back to the 24th century.

904
00:44:06,339 --> 00:44:08,640
Tell it to the arbiter.

905
00:44:08,678 --> 00:44:10,170
I'm innocent, I tell you.

906
00:44:10,215 --> 00:44:12,152
This is all a misunderstanding.

907
00:44:12,186 --> 00:44:13,450
Rom, get me a lawyer.

908
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:15,050
I'll contact Cousin Gaila.

909
00:44:15,093 --> 00:44:16,996
I'm sure he'll know a good one.

910
00:44:17,032 --> 00:44:19,094
Rom, you idiot!

911
00:44:19,137 --> 00:44:21,905
See you in a few weeks, Brother.
