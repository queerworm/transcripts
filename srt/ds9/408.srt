1
00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:04,463
ROM:
All right, everyone,
gather around.

2
00:00:04,463 --> 00:00:06,340
We're about to start.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,218
When a young Ferengi
goes out on his own,

4
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:12,387
he traditionally
raises capital

5
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:15,015
by selling
his boyhood treasures.

6
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,768
As you know, my son, Nog,

7
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:19,645
will be leaving
shortly for Earth

8
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:22,272
and Starfleet Academy.

9
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:27,027
I'm going to miss him,
and I know you will, too

10
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,864
and what better way
to remember him

11
00:00:29,864 --> 00:00:31,532
than to purchase

12
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:34,994
one of his very own
personal belongings.

13
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:36,203
I don't know about you,

14
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:38,163
but I'm buying
these pajamas.

15
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,081
That'll be
three strips of latinum.

16
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,041
Two!
Sold!

17
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,336
NOG:
Let the buying commence!

18
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:46,588
No reasonable offer
will be refused.

19
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:55,389
I didn't expect to see
you here, Mr. Worf.

20
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:56,640
Captain Sisko made it

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,559
a personal request
that I attend.

22
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,687
He seems to have taken some
interest in the young Ferengi.

23
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,146
Well, the Captain
sponsored

24
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,773
Nog's application
to the Academy.

25
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:08,694
A Ferengi at the Academy--
I'm not sure that is wise.

26
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:10,070
Oh, I don't know
about that.

27
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,031
Not so long ago,
someone might have

28
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:13,657
said the same
thing about you.

29
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:14,992
You two better hurry

30
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:17,118
or there won't
be anything left to buy.

31
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:21,832
Nog, what is this?

32
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:24,125
My favorite
holosuite program.

33
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,712
"A visit with
the Pleasure Goddess of Rixx."

34
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:28,672
Yours for a mere
ten strips of latinum.

35
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:31,425
He'll take it.

36
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,218
Well, consider it a gift.

37
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:35,220
Well, you're too kind.

38
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,597
KIRA:
Nog...

39
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:39,391
where did you get
this springball racket?

40
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:41,560
Out of a replicator?

41
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,729
Try out of my quarters.
This is mine.

42
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:45,898
I've been looking for this
for two years.

43
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:48,233
And it was sitting here
on the bar all along.

44
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,484
That's incredible.

45
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,652
(<i> chuckles</i> )

46
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,037
It's a Ferengi
tooth sharpener.

47
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:04,374
(<i> buzzing</i> )

48
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:08,796
(<i> grunts</i> )

49
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,804
How much?

50
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:24,645
Rom.

51
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,271
Brother, you're here.

52
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,023
If you hurry,
there still might be

53
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:29,984
some choice items
left for you to buy.

54
00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:31,610
I'm not here
for the sale.

55
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,570
Nog has no business going
to Starfleet Academy,

56
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,740
and I'm not doing anything
to encourage him.

57
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,199
Now, come with me.

58
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,868
But the sale...

59
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,454
It's over as far
as you're concerned.

60
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:45,082
The ship, it's here.

61
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,750
What ship?

62
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,752
The ship, our ship--

63
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,420
<i>my</i> ship?

64
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,506
The shuttle
Cousin Gaila owed me?

65
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,883
He's owed you
that shuttle for ten years.

66
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,635
Ever since I loaned
him the latinum

67
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,386
to start up his
munitions consortium.

68
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:01,140
He always said that
if he became a success,

69
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,433
he'd buy me my own ship.

70
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,601
Now it's here.

71
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,561
But why do you need me?

72
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,605
Because knowing our
cousin, it's probably

73
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,107
defective merchandise.

74
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:12,151
I'd better
have a look at it.

75
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:13,568
What a wonderful idea.

76
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,737
Now get going.

77
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,993
And leave the clothes... here.

78
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,257
Brother?

79
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,759
All right,

80
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,469
tell me what's wrong with it.

81
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,972
Nothing.
The ship is perfect!

82
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,891
Gaila must have paid
a fortune for it.

83
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,143
You mean it'll actually fly?

84
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:48,729
This ship could outrun
a Romulan interceptor.

85
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,148
We could take it halfway
across the galaxy

86
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,483
before it would even
need a maintenance check.

87
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,235
You don't say.

88
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,445
And it's all mine.

89
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,990
I can go anyplace I want.

90
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,825
Maybe it's time you considered

91
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,785
that early retirement
we talked about.

92
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,286
I could take over the bar,

93
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:07,831
and you could fly off
into the great unknown,

94
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,208
never to return!

95
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,502
Unless you wanted to.

96
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,213
Don't get your hopes up.

97
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:16,006
The first thing
we need to do

98
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:18,800
is take this thing
for a test flight...

99
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,596
someplace reasonably
far away but safe.

100
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,639
Someplace like...

101
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,807
Earth?

102
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,185
Exactly.

103
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:31,605
If the boy wants to go
to Starfleet Academy,

104
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,523
he might as well
do it in style.

105
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,900
Yes, Brother!

106
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,568
Thank you, Brother!

107
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,612
I'll go tell Nog.

108
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:42,323
A trip to Earth--
this is going to be<i> fun!</i>

109
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,785
(<i> chuckling</i> )

110
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:48,622
Not to mention profitable.

111
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:53,043
All I ask is a tall ship,

112
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:56,463
and a load of contraband
to fill her with.

113
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,215
(<i> chuckles</i> )

114
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,841
Here are the codes to operate
the holosuite programs.

115
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,802
Now, remember, don't
extend any lines of credit,

116
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,346
don't touch the dabo girls,

117
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:13,934
and make sure you keep
your eyes on<i> him,</i>

118
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:17,229
because he'll be keeping
his eyes on you.

119
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,985
Good choice, Quark.

120
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:27,197
I'm sure Morn will do
an excellent job

121
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:30,409
as long as he doesn't
drink up all your profits.

122
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:32,411
Better him than one
of my Ferengi waiters.

123
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:35,080
They'd rob me blind.
Hmm.

124
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,209
Very generous of you,
taking Nog to Earth.

125
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,461
I'm a generous person.

126
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,463
So I've noticed.

127
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,840
Try not to miss me
too much while I'm gone.

128
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,844
I'll be counting the days
until you get back.

129
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,596
Yeah.

130
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:03,108
I wonder how many hours
you and I spent

131
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,651
hanging around up here?

132
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,361
2,147.

133
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:07,695
(<i> chuckles</i> )

134
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,572
Just kidding, but it was a lot.

135
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,035
You know,
aside from playing dom-jot

136
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,455
and watching
the Bajoran transports dock,

137
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:19,291
it seems like we spent most
of our time doing nothing.

138
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:22,002
Maybe so, but I can't
think of anyone

139
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,504
I'd rather do nothing with
than you.

140
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,381
Same here.

141
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:27,548
Nog.

142
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,094
Doctor, if you're
trying to return

143
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,888
something from
the sale...
It's a going-away present.

144
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,265
To help you get around
easier on Earth.

145
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,856
A guidebook?

146
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,399
It's not just
a guidebook.

147
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,401
It's a completely
interactive program

148
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:49,612
detailing Earth's customs,
culture, history, geography...

149
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,698
Everything you ever
wanted to know about Earth

150
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,325
is right there in that padd.

151
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:56,411
You mean, it'll teach me
how to attract human females?

152
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:59,414
Well... almost everything.

153
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,500
I'm sure it'll come in handy.
Thank you.

154
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,001
Well, I'd better be going.

155
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,837
My father and Uncle Quark
are waiting for me.

156
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:07,047
Good luck, Nog.

157
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,217
Make us proud.

158
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,307
(<i> sighs</i> )

159
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,768
I'll, uh...

160
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:21,978
I'll walk you over
to the airlock.

161
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,407
That was a good spot.

162
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:34,491
The best.

163
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,003
The Ferengi Shuttle
<i>Quark's Treasure</i>

164
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,422
has just departed the station.

165
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:51,258
Quark, Rom and Nog,
together on that ship

166
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:52,967
all the way to Earth?

167
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,511
Glad I'm not
going with them.

168
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,096
Only thing that worries me...

169
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,265
no one warned Earth
that they're coming.

170
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,607
It says here that humans

171
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,860
didn't even have currency
until 5,000 years ago,

172
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,363
let alone banking,
speculative investments,

173
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,198
or a unified global economy.

174
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,492
They're a primitive,
backward people, Nog.

175
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:19,202
Pity them.

176
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,704
But think about it, Uncle--
that means they went

177
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,748
from being savages
with a simple barter system

178
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,501
to leaders of a vast
interstellar Federation

179
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:29,087
in only 5,000 years.
It took us twice as long

180
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,797
to establish
the Ferengi Alliance

181
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,340
and we had to buy
warp technology from the...

182
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,594
5,000... 10,000...
what's the difference?

183
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:37,929
The speed
of technological advancement

184
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:41,057
isn't nearly as important
as short-term quarterly gains.

185
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,143
Can't this thing
go any faster?

186
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:46,062
We're already exceeding
the safe maximum cruising speed

187
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,606
by 2/10 of a warp factor.

188
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:49,274
Push it another tenth.

189
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,526
This trip is taking
long enough as it is.

190
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:53,320
Relax, Brother.

191
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,904
I know kemacite is unstable,

192
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,490
but another
day or two

193
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,283
won't make
any difference.

194
00:10:58,283 --> 00:10:59,618
What are you talking about?

195
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:01,119
The shipment of kemacite

196
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,955
that you're smuggling
in the cargo hold.

197
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,873
Uncle, are you
smuggling kemacite?

198
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,125
Isn't that dangerous?

199
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:10,211
Dangerous...
and highly profitable

200
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,921
especially if we make
a side trip to Orion

201
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,924
on the way home
from Earth.

202
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,301
What tipped you off?

203
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,345
When I engaged
the impulse engines,

204
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:21,264
I noticed the ship's weight
distribution was a little off,

205
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,891
so the last time you went
to waste extraction,

206
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,685
I snuck back to the cargo bay
and took a look around.

207
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,271
When did you
get to be so smart?

208
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:31,065
I've always
been smart, Brother.

209
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,193
I've just lacked
self-confidence.

210
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:36,488
Of course,
I could forget everything I saw.

211
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,906
How much?

212
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:42,160
20 percent of the profits.

213
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,413
I suppose you'll want
a cut, too?

214
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:48,082
As a Starfleet Cadet,
it's my duty to report

215
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:51,419
any violation of Federation law
to my superiors immediately...

216
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,712
but then again,
I haven't been sworn in yet.

217
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:54,713
I'll take 10 percent.

218
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:57,300
It's a deal.

219
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,263
I thought I told you
to go faster.

220
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:05,475
Faster it is!

221
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,647
(<i> sighs</i> )

222
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,409
Brother, wake up.

223
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:25,119
We're approaching
Earth's star system.

224
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,163
Take her out of warp.

225
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,750
Father, have you ever heard
of the Bell Riots?

226
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,253
Don't bother me now.

227
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,338
But doesn't this
Gabriel Bell human

228
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:36,839
look just like Captain Sisko?

229
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,841
All hu-mans look alike.

230
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:42,095
I thought I told you
to take us out of warp.

231
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,514
I'm trying, Brother, but
the warp core isn't responding.

232
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:47,225
It looks like the command
sequencer has been disabled.

233
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:50,144
I don't understand.
I tested everything!

234
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,855
The only way
this could've happened is...

235
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:56,443
if the command sequencer
was<i> designed</i> to fail.

236
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:57,736
You mean sabotage.

237
00:12:57,736 --> 00:12:59,987
Cousin Gaila.

238
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,156
He never did like you
very much, Uncle.

239
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,284
Okay, okay, no need to panic.

240
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,952
So the warp drive
won't shut down.

241
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,579
What's the worst thing
that could happen?

242
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:09,080
The ship could
continue accelerating

243
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,665
until it tears itself apart

244
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:14,043
and scatters our remains
halfway across the Quadrant.

245
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,212
There must be something
we can do!

246
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,922
Jettison the warp core?
No, I tried that already.

247
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,758
Emergency overrides
are frozen.

248
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:22,260
Then we'll have to try
something else, won't we?

249
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:25,138
The kemacite!

250
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,265
If we vent plasma
from the warp core

251
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:29,601
into the cargo hold,
we may be able to start

252
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,603
a cascade reaction
in the kemacite.

253
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:34,147
Then we can modulate
the reaction

254
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,856
to create an
inversion wave

255
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,858
in the warp field
and force the ship

256
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,319
back into normal space!

257
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,738
If I time it just right,
I should be able to get us

258
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,783
close enough to Earth
to make an emergency landing!

259
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:47,368
Rom, you're a genius!

260
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,205
Think so?
How should I know?

261
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,374
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

262
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,709
Just do it.

263
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,962
Hold on!

264
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,885
(<i> screaming</i> )

265
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,731
(<i> gasping</i> )

266
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,445
Rom?

267
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,364
Nog?

268
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:40,714
Get me General Denning.

269
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:43,924
Tell him one
of the Martians is awake.

270
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,740
(<i> no audio</i> )

271
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,667
We've got the farmer
who found their ship.

272
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,627
He's locked up in the BOQ,

273
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,880
but I don't know how much
longer we can keep him there.

274
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,549
You keep him there
until I tell you to let him go.

275
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,092
Did you take care
of that idiot in Roswell

276
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:29,011
who told the press
we captured a flying saucer?

277
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,347
We've convinced him
to issue a retraction.

278
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,558
Turns out it was just
a weather balloon.

279
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:34,975
Weather balloon?

280
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,061
We had to come up
with something quick.

281
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,605
Last thing we need
is a bunch

282
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,356
of reporters
snooping around.

283
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,901
You can't keep this from
the public forever, General.

284
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:45,069
Beings from another planet
have landed on Earth.

285
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,947
This is one of
the most important
events in human history.

286
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,659
Maybe, but we can't risk
causing a panic.

287
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,161
I'm not telling
the public anything

288
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:57,415
until we find out exactly
what we're up against.

289
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,296
QUARK:
<i>Pip im gren tovat.</i>

290
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:04,338
<i>Yop bree</i>

291
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,424
<i>gren skin law po far.</i>

292
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:07,759
<i>Yop im too, yoba.</i>

293
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,636
<i>Yop sko ta yop ma.</i>

294
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,679
(<i> groans</i> )

295
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:20,020
(<i> Quark grunting</i> )

296
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:22,690
(<i> yells</i> )

297
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,652
It's locked.

298
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,278
What is this place?

299
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:28,529
Where are we?

300
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,782
I wish you'd stop
asking that.

301
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:31,825
I told you I don't know.

302
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,493
The last thing I remember

303
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,954
was Father taking the shuttle
in for an emergency landing.

304
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:43,043
Well, we must be on Earth.

305
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,295
But where?

306
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:45,964
One thing's for sure--

307
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:47,632
this isn't Starfleet Academy.

308
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,258
I wonder what happened
to the ship.

309
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,927
My ship.

310
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,720
Where's my ship?

311
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,389
Hey!

312
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,391
Is anybody out there?!

313
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,686
What did you do with my ship?!

314
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:03,731
I want my ship back!

315
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,108
<i>Goss uff wok ton!</i>
<i>Goss uff wok ton!</i>

316
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,902
He's trying
to break out.

317
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:09,487
Don't let them
hurt him.

318
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:10,530
He's just scared.

319
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,198
General, these creatures come

320
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,325
from a race far more advanced
than our own.

321
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:16,619
There's no telling
what they can teach us.

322
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,663
We have to try
to communicate with them.

323
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:19,873
Well, you're in luck.

324
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,332
The President agrees with you

325
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:23,334
and he wants us to try
and talk to them.

326
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,586
So that's just what
you're going to do.

327
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,129
Me?

328
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,756
Look, Professor, we
didn't ask you here

329
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,758
just because you're
Nurse Garland's fiancé.

330
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,302
I need someone
to talk to these Martians.

331
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,304
You're elected.

332
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,354
I knew Earth was a bad idea.

333
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:46,190
Ferengis and humans
have no business being together

334
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,735
but<i> you</i> had to go
to Starfleet Academy.

335
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,194
Don't blame my son.

336
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,279
It was your idea
to use Gaila's shuttle.

337
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,740
And you were the one
who said it was safe.

338
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,324
Leave him alone!

339
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,410
If it wasn't for my father,
we'd all be dead.

340
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,411
Maybe we are dead.

341
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,954
What are you
talking about?

342
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,288
Maybe this is
the Divine Treasury.

343
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,457
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

344
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,168
The Divine Treasury
is made of pure latinum.

345
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:09,088
Besides, where's
the Blessed Exchequer?

346
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,424
Where are the Celestial
Auctioneers?

347
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:14,301
And why aren't we bidding
for our new lives, hmm?

348
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:16,763
You don't think we're
in the other place?

349
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,806
The Vault
of Eternal Destitution?

350
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:19,933
Don't be ridiculous.

351
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:22,309
The bar was showing a profit.

352
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,394
(<i> door latch clicks</i> )

353
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,154
(<i> door closes</i> )

354
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,076
(<i> clears throat</i> )

355
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:42,413
Welcome to Earth.

356
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:44,624
We mean you no harm.

357
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:47,877
(<i> with echoing distortion):</i>
We're sorry we had to separate

358
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,337
you from your ship,
but I'm sure you can

359
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,715
understand we have
lots of questions

360
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:54,592
for you.

361
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,427
Did you understand
a word of that?

362
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:59,179
Our universal translators
must be malfunctioning.

363
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:06,270
What are they doing?

364
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,064
Maybe it's some kind
of greeting.

365
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:09,482
She may be onto...

366
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,734

...something.

(<i> distorted gibberish</i> )

368
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,991
What are they doing?

369
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:21,577
Maybe their universal
translators are broken, too.

370
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,746
No! They don't have
universal translators.

371
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,623
I recognize those uniforms

372
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:27,792
from my guidebook,
they're from the 20th century.

373
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,795
The 20th century?!
You mean we traveled
back through time?

374
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:32,130
More than 400 years!

375
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,714
Those are military uniforms

376
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,549
from one
of the old nation states.

377
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,384
Uh... Australia or something.

378
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,720
So if they don't have
universal translators,

379
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,722
then why are they
banging their heads?

380
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,314
They're just mimicking us.

381
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:08,374

383
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:15,255
I'd always heard primitive
humans lacked intelligence

384
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,717
but I had no idea
they were this stupid.

385
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,343
They weren't just stupid.

386
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,470
They were violent, petty,
bigoted and selfish.

387
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,097
And we're stuck
here with them.

388
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:25,683
Maybe for the rest
of our lives.

389
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:30,521
The three of us and millions
of primitive hu-mans.

390
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:33,566
I like those odds.

I've given them
every medical test
I can think of,

395
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,726
but the only thing
I can tell you for sure

396
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:10,228
is they're not human.

397
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:11,729
Well, that's a start.

398
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:13,856
I think these two
are involved

399
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:15,233
in some kind
of a grooming ritual.

400
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:16,316
Look how the older one

401
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,568
is taking care
of the younger one.

402
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,028
That's sweet.

403
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,030
Maybe they're
father and son.

404
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,865
Wouldn't that
be something?

405
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:24,242
They've come
from so far away,

406
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:25,659
but they still have

407
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,246
the same basic family
structure that we do.

408
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:30,623
I wonder if the third one's
related, too.

409
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:33,209
For all we know, it
could be the mother.

<i>Gren fa hoe</i>
<i>loth pex-pil?!</i>

411
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:39,632
If she is the mother,
she's quite a shrew.

412
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,717
I'm working as fast
as I can, Brother,

413
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,636
but there must be
some kind of interference

414
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:44,887
disrupting
our translators.

415
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,015
What kind
of interference?

416
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,767
I'm not sure.

417
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:53,395
Could be solar flares,
or maybe ionic interference,

418
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:56,023
or I suppose it could be
beta radiation,

419
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,567
but that's only produced
by nuclear fission.

420
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,569
Don't be an idiot.

421
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:03,823
Nuclear fission doesn't happen
within planetary atmospheres.

422
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,116
It does here.

423
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:06,784
In the 20th century,
humans used

424
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:08,744
crude nuclear reactors
as weapons.

425
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,412
They called them
"atom bombs."

426
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,539
They used to blow
them up all the time.

427
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:16,252
They irradiated
their own planet?

428
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:17,628
If Nog says so, they did.

429
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:19,588
He knows all about
Earth history.

430
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,632
You better fix
those translators fast.

431
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:23,509
The sooner we start talking
to these savages,

432
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,594
the better off we'll be.

If you say so, Professor.

Ouch! That looks
like it hurts.

443
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:15,519
Well, he doesn't
seem to mind.

Oh...

445
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:22,193
I wish I could
get some help.

446
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:25,738
I don't know why we can't
bring in a few more experts.

447
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:27,281
Let's face it, Jeff--

448
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:29,075
when it comes to beings
from another planet

449
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:30,784
we don't have any experts.

450
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:33,704
You'll find a way
of communicating
with them, darling.

451
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:34,830
I know you will.

452
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:38,751
Imagine
the possibilities.

453
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:41,003
Who knows what they
could teach us?

454
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:43,005
A few years from now,

455
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:46,050
mankind could have
rocket ships of our own.

456
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:49,220
We could travel the galaxy,
exploring new worlds

457
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,097
and new civilizations.

458
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:52,765
Always the dreamer.

459
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:54,474
That's why you love me.

460
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,143
It's funny, isn't it?

461
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:57,853
Here we are in the middle

462
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,981
of one of the greatest
discoveries in human history

463
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,649
and all I can think about

464
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:05,986
is what you're going to look
like in your wedding dress.

465
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,321
My mother keeps asking

466
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:09,531
where we're going
on our honeymoon.

467
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,992
She thinks we should go
to Niagara Falls.

468
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,452
Well, who knows?

469
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:18,749
Maybe we'll go to Mars.

471
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,671
What's that
disgusting smell?

472
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,340
I think it's
called "tobacco."

473
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,633
It's a deadly drug.

474
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:28,926
When used frequently,

475
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:30,803
it destroys the
internal organs.

476
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:33,431
If it's so deadly,
then why do they use it?

477
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:34,932
It's also
highly addictive.

478
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:36,142
How do they get
their hands on it?

479
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:37,351
They buy it in stores.

480
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:39,186
They buy it?

481
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:42,189
If they'll buy poison,
they'll buy anything.

482
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,482
I think I'm going
to like it here.

483
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:46,235
Uncle, I hope
you're not thinking

484
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:48,946
of doing anything that
will disrupt the timeline.

485
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:50,156
Perish the thought.

486
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:51,573
Changing the
history of Earth

487
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,784
could affect
the entire galaxy.

488
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:56,494
The Federation,
Deep Space 9--

489
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:59,081
your bar-- could all
cease to exist.

490
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:00,540
Wouldn't that be a shame?

491
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,460
Rom, hurry up
with those translators.

492
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:08,841
The alien ship has a small
control area in the front

493
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:11,551
and rudimentary
sleeping quarters in the back.

494
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:14,221
So far, we can't even figure out
what drives the engines,
let alone how they work.

495
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:18,392
Hey, how you doing, big fella?

496
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:20,978
You making any headway,
Professor?

497
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:23,814
It's fascinating.
I would've expected creatures

00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:25,858
of their technological
sophistication

499
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:28,694
to communicate telepathically,
but they seem to have

500
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:30,904
a structured verbal language
just like we do.

501
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,530
Given enough time,

502
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,741
a good team of linguists
could probably decipher it.

503
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,827
We're not bringing in
anyone else.

504
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:38,787
Too many people
know about this as it is.

505
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,373
Besides, we don't
have the time.

506
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:42,749
President Truman's
an impatient man.

507
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:45,294
He wants answers
and he wants them now.

508
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:47,587
Jeff, General Denning,

509
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,547
I think you'd better come inside
right away.

00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:59,975
My name is Quark,

512
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:05,689
and... I've got
a business proposition for you.

513
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,450
I don't see
any universal translator.

514
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,494
Trust me.
It's in there.

515
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:20,079
So this gadget
of yours is

516
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,373
what makes it possible for us
to understand each other?

517
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:23,623
How's it work?

518
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:26,419
It's simple<i> if you know how.</i>

519
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:28,337
You'd be surprised at the kind
of things you can do

520
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:29,838
with the right technology.

521
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,382
Which brings me
to why I'm here.

522
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:33,800
I was wondering about that.

523
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,345
I've been sent by my people
to open up a market

524
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:38,514
for advanced Ferengi technology.

525
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:41,100
What kind of technology
you talking about?

526
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,769
How would you like to travel
beyond the stars

at speeds you never even dreamt
were possible?

528
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,065
Or to transport yourselves
from one place to another

529
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:49,483
in the blink of an eye?

530
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:51,026
You know how
to do that?

That's only the beginning.

532
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:55,281
We can give you
the medical knowledge

533
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:57,491
to cure
your deadliest diseases.

534
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:59,785
We have machines that can
produce food and clothing

535
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:00,994
out of thin air.

536
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:01,995
What about weapons?

537
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,414
Weapons?!

538
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:05,541
If you want weapons,
I'm the man to see.

539
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:09,002
We could teach you to
make phasers, disruptors,

540
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:13,299
photon torpedoes...
or even quantum torpedoes--

541
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:15,468
a little more expensive
<i>but</i> worth it.

542
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:16,510
What do you want in return?

543
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,886
That depends.

544
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:20,598
What do you use for
currency around here--

545
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:23,058
latinum, dilithium?

546
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,351
We use dollars.

547
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,812
Dollars?
Never heard of them.

548
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:28,897
Don't you have any gemstones
or precious minerals?

549
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,941
You mean like gold?
Gold is good.

550
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:32,734
How much gold
are we talking about?

551
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:35,070
Seeing how we're going to be
advancing your culture

552
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,740
about 400 years
overnight, I'd say

553
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,784
a couple of million bars
would be about right...

554
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:42,828
as a good faith deposit.

555
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:45,331
You know, Quark, you might be
some kind of Martian...

556
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:46,832
Ferengi.

557
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:48,792
Whatever,
but the more we talk,

558
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:51,545
the more you remind me
of my brother-in-law.

559
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:53,088
Is he a businessman?

560
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,341
He's a car salesman
and not a very good one.

561
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:57,259
Then he's nothing like me.

562
00:27:57,259 --> 00:28:00,304
The bottom line is,
I don't trust him,

563
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:01,847
and I don't trust you.

564
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:04,141
So before we sit down
and sign any contracts

565
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:05,976
you are going to tell me

566
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:08,187
just what the hell you people
are really doing here.

567
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:09,563
I just told you.

568
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:11,815
We're here to open up
trade negotiations.

569
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:14,234
If you're not interested,
just say so.

570
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,902
I'm sure I can do business

571
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:18,696
with one of your planet's
other nation states.

572
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:20,866
In other words, if we don't
play ball, you're going to sell

573
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,535
these advanced weapons of yours
to the Russians.

574
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:25,204
I'd rather
it didn't come to that.

575
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:29,458
To be honest, I'd much rather
work with you Australians.

576
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:32,211
Americans.
Whatever.

577
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:35,214
But, if you won't do business
with me and the Russians will,

578
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,257
who am I to say no?

579
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,343
I-I'm not saying
we can't do business,

580
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:42,054
but I don't have the authority
to make this kind of decision.

581
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,514
I'll have to get, uh...

582
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:44,848
Well, I'll have to get clearance

583
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,559
from the President.
I can wait.

584
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:50,312
(<i> clears throat</i> )

585
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:53,357
In the meantime,
let me give you some free advice

586
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:55,484
just to show you
I'm on your side.

587
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:58,529
You people should
take better care of yourselves.

588
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:00,947
Stop poisoning your bodies
with tobacco

589
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:03,033
and atom bombs.

590
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:06,203
Sooner or later, that kind
of stuff will kill you.

591
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:08,830
What do you know
about atom bombs?

592
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:12,084
My people have been watching
your world for years.

593
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:14,086
We know all about you--

594
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:19,592
baseball, root beer,
darts, atom bombs.

595
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:23,679
It's quite a fascinating culture
you hu-mans have here.

596
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,640
And with a little
Ferengi technology,

597
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,517
it could be even better.

598
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:33,480
Now, why don't you go talk
to that president of yours?

599
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,568
(<i> coughs</i> )

600
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,369
Let me get this straight, Rom.

601
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:49,371
Are you saying that all
the women on your world

602
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:52,207
walk around naked?

603
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,251
Uh-huh.
It's the law.

604
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:55,877
You don't say.

605
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:59,089
Well, I guess I'm never going
to visit your world.

606
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:00,299
And neither are you.

607
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,676
NOG:
Uh, Nurse Garland...

608
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:04,553
I'm having trouble
with my ear again.

609
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:05,887
Could you massage it
some more?

610
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:10,684
Are you sure you don't want
a doctor to look at that?

611
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:13,562
No. I feel more
comfortable with you.

612
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:17,316
Ah... ah...

613
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:19,192
Much better.

614
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:24,030
You know, come to think of it,
my ear's bothering me, too.

615
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:26,866
Brother!

616
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:28,619
How did your meeting
with the general go?

617
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:33,624
It's... late.

618
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:35,041
We should let you
get some rest.

619
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,544
I'm not tired!

620
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:41,047
We'll visit
some more tomorrow.

621
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:44,384
There's something about
that female that I don't like.

622
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:47,179
She's so... cheerful.

623
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:48,388
What about the general?

624
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,432
Is he going
to let us leave?

625
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:51,475
Don't worry.

626
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:52,851
Everything's under control.

627
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,060
(<i> barking</i> )

628
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:59,525
Oh, they forgot
to take that<i> thing</i> with them.

629
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:06,990
It seems to like
you, Brother.

630
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,368
Get away from me.

631
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:14,373
Hello, Quark.

632
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:17,292
Odo, what are you doing here?

633
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:20,546
Placing you under arrest for
attempting to smuggle kemacite.

634
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:22,297
Did you really
expect me to believe

635
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,466
that you were traveling
all the way to Earth

636
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:26,092
just to be nice to your nephew?

637
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:28,887
You hid on board the ship.
That's right.

638
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,014
And now I'm stuck
here with you.

639
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,141
Now listen carefully, because
we don't have much time.

640
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,101
Someone could come in
any minute.

641
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,269
Your ship is in a hangar

642
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,856
on the other side
of the base.

643
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:40,858
It sustained some damage
in the crash,

644
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:42,818
but the engines
are still functioning.

645
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:44,570
If we're lucky,
we should be able

646
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,196
to use it to get away from here.

647
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:47,364
And go where?

648
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:49,032
Even if we get out of here,

649
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:51,410
we'll still going to be trapped
400 years in the past.

650
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,870
Actually, I've
been thinking.

651
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,663
If there's enough
kemacite left,

652
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:56,540
there might be a way to
get back to our own time.

653
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,667
How?
If we find

654
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:01,420
a sufficiently
powerful energy source

655
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,589
we should be able to
trigger a temporal surge

656
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:05,006
in the subspace continuum

657
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,884
and recreate the same
kind of time warp

658
00:32:06,884 --> 00:32:08,427
that brought us here
in the first place!

659
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:09,678
What do you mean by

660
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:11,430
"a sufficiently
powerful energy source"?

661
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,598
We're not going anywhere.

662
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,558
We're staying
right here.

663
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:16,184
But, Brother,
what about the bar?

664
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,019
Who cares about the bar?

665
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,606
I'm telling you, Rom,
we stay here,

666
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:24,234
and inside of a year,
we'll be running this place.

667
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:26,278
You mean the military base?

668
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:27,654
I mean the whole planet.

669
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:30,407
Huh!
"Harumph"
all you want.

670
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:32,618
But these hu-mans--
they're nothing

671
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:34,578
like the ones
from the Federation.

672
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:38,206
They're crude,
gullible and greedy.

673
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,958
You mean like you.

674
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:45,046
Yeah. These are humans
I can understand and<i> manipulate.</i>

675
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,006
But, Uncle, what
about the timeline?

676
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,759
Forget this
timeline.

677
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:51,386
The one we're going to create
will be better.

678
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,388
Once we get things
in order here,

679
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:54,807
we'll contact
the Ferengi homeworld

680
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:56,683
and sell them our ship.

681
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:59,812
The Ferengi will have
warp drive technology

682
00:32:59,812 --> 00:33:04,316
centuries before hu-mans
or Klingons or even the Vulcans.

683
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:06,902
We'll establish
an economic empire

684
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:10,071
beyond even Grand Nagus Zek's
wildest dreams,

685
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,365
and I'll control it all.

686
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:15,410
You do have
a vivid imagination,

687
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,997
but the only place we're going
is back to our own time.

688
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,082
I'll have the ship
ready to go in six hours,

689
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:24,753
and you're<i> all</i>
going to be on it.

690
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:29,382
I'm not going back,
and neither is my ship.

691
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,426
We'll see about that.

692
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,825
What's the word,
General?

693
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:56,869
That little
piano-playing Democrat's

694
00:33:56,869 --> 00:33:58,620
not as dumb as he looks.

695
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,831
He's not about to make a deal
with these aliens

696
00:34:00,831 --> 00:34:02,499
until we learn
more about them.

697
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:04,334
And how does the president
propose we do that?

698
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:06,920
He said he'd leave that
in our capable hands.

699
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,588
Don't worry, General.

700
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,590
I'll find out what
those Martians are up to.

701
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,634
See that you do.

702
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:21,852
This is the opportunity
of a lifetime.

703
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:23,186
I don't know, Brother.

704
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,938
It seems awfully
risky to me.

705
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:27,691
The riskier the road,
the greater the profit.

706
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:30,861
What about Rule of
Acquisition 203?

707
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:33,989
"New customers are like
razor-toothed gree-worms.

708
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:36,867
They can be succulent,
but sometimes they bite back."

709
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:38,201
No...

710
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,620
if there's any biting
to be done,

711
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,164
we're the ones who are
going to do it, huh?

712
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,250
(<i> door opens</i> )

713
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,842
QUARK:
Get this off me.

714
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:55,218
Get this off me!

715
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,428
I can't breathe!

716
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:57,721
This is an outrage!

717
00:34:57,721 --> 00:34:59,723
I demand to see General Denning.

718
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:01,558
If I don't get satisfaction,

719
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:04,019
I'm taking my business
to the Russians.

720
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:05,645
The Russians...

721
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:08,273
that's a good place to start.

722
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:12,986
Why don't you tell me everything
you know about the Russians?

723
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:31,797
(<i> screaming</i> )

724
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:34,257
Would you please
stop doing that?

725
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,884
That's the fifth
injection

726
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:38,261
of sodium pentothal
I've given him.

727
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,888
It's not working.

728
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:42,766
Their biochemistry
is obviously
nothing like ours.

729
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:45,477
Then stop sticking me
with those needles!

730
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:46,728
Captain, this is wrong.

731
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:48,271
These people
are our guests.

732
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:51,190
They're not people.
They're... things.

733
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,485
Invaders
from another world.

734
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:57,363
It's up to us to put an end
to whatever they're planning.

735
00:35:57,363 --> 00:36:02,077
Now, if you don't tell me
what I want to know,

736
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:04,203
needles are going to be

737
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:06,205
the least
of your worries.

738
00:36:10,127 --> 00:36:12,712
You know, Doc,

739
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:16,800
I've always wanted to see
what a Martian looked like...

740
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,928
from the inside.

741
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:22,305
Don't you people
have laws against
this kind of thing?

742
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:25,142
Not when it comes
to national security.

743
00:36:25,142 --> 00:36:28,478
Now, which one
should we start with?

744
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:31,064
The loud one?

745
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:35,819
The little one...

746
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:38,488
or the quiet one?

747
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:42,575
Now why don't you tell us
why you're really here?

748
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:45,120
It was an accident.
We're from the future.

749
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,955
The warp core was sabotaged.

750
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:48,665
It's all Cousin Gaila's fault.

751
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:50,583
I want to go home!

752
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,711
I want my Moogie!

753
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,754
Moogie?

754
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:55,797
You want the truth?

755
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:57,507
I'll tell you the truth.

756
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:59,551
We're advance scouts
for the Ferengi invasion fleet.

757
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:00,886
I knew it!

758
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:03,555
Nog, what are you
talking about?

759
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,431
We've been studying you puny
earthlings for centuries

760
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:06,808
and you're ripe for conquest.

761
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:08,643
It's not true!

762
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,062
Moogie!

763
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:11,437
It's no use,
Supreme Commander.

764
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,148
They've seen
through our cover,

765
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:15,817
but knowing our plans
won't do them any good.

766
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:18,070
Even now, 300 Marauder-class

767
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,113
attack cruisers
are orbiting your planet

768
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:21,781
preparing for the attack.

769
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,825
Moogie!

770
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:25,785
I'm telling you this is crazy!

771
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,079
Nog, tell him the truth.

772
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:29,206
We're helpless.
We're harmless.

773
00:37:29,206 --> 00:37:31,374
We just want to sell you things.

774
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:33,877
Captain, I'm not sure
I believe this invasion story.

775
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:36,588
You scientists.

776
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:38,381
You're like children--

777
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:41,718
always walking around
with your heads in the clouds.

778
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:42,886
Keep talking.

779
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:44,846
When the appointed
hour arrives,

780
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:46,472
the Marauders
will deactivate

781
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:48,183
their cloaking devices
and begin

782
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:50,143
transporting
Klingon shock troops

783
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:51,978
directly to the landing zone.

784
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,396
Landing zone?

785
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:54,856
Where? Tell me.

786
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:56,441
Why not?

787
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,693
Your feeble weapons
will be useless against us.

788
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,863
We will kill all your males
and take your females

789
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:03,531
to mate with.

790
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,033
Where's the landing zone?

791
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:08,203
Untie me and I will show you
on that map.

792
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:10,496
You heard him.

793
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:14,709
Go get General Denning.

794
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:18,296
Tell him he was right
about the Martians all along.

795
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,133
Show me.

796
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,973
The first landing parties
will arrive here.

797
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:29,307
Where?

798
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,184
Here. Right by
this blue blob.

799
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:33,770
You mean your people
are going to invade...

800
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:36,397
Cleveland?
No, not Cleveland.

801
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,399
Right...<i> here!</i> 
(<i> grunts</i> )

802
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,694
MAN:
Hold it!
Don't hurt him.

803
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,989
It was an accident.
I tripped.

804
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:45,740
I didn't mean
to do it.

805
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,742
I'm really,
really sorry.
Shoot him!

806
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:51,913
NOG:
Thank you.

807
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:54,457
We're all grateful
but couldn't you have
done that an hour ago?

808
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:55,792
We've got to get
you out of here.

809
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:57,418
Won't you get
in trouble for this?

810
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:00,088
Why should they?

811
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:03,549
We forced them to help us
by using our, uh...

812
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:06,678
Your insidious
mind control powers.

813
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:09,181
That's not bad.

814
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:11,057
For a primitive female,
she's pretty smart.

815
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,558
Come on.

816
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,393
Your ship's in Hangar 18.

817
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:15,770
Come on.

818
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,277
Captain Wainwright
needs to see you

819
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:23,402
in Examination Room 3.

820
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,495
Hold it right there.

821
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,207
Stay back...

822
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:38,293
or I'll disintegrate
this hostage.

823
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:39,669
With your finger?

824
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:41,671
With my death ray.

825
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:44,299
Looks a lot like
a finger to me.

826
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:50,680
Who's he?

827
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,932
My hero.

828
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:55,310
Can we please leave now?

829
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:11,284
You're sure they're going
to be detonating
an atomic bomb today?

830
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:12,785
GARLAND:
That's what it said
in the papers.

831
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,495
5:00 a.m. at the proving
grounds in Nevada.

832
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:15,955
But I don't see
how an atomic bomb

833
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:16,998
is going to help you
to get home.

834
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:18,375
ROM:
It's simple.

835
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:20,001
We need to harness
the beta radiation

836
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:21,336
to trigger a cascade...

837
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:22,921
Save your breath.

838
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:25,006
It's much too complicated
for them to grasp.

839
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:26,841
5:00 a.m.-- that's
seven minutes from now.

840
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:27,842
Don't worry.

841
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,094
We'll get there.

842
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:30,595
Thanks for your help.

843
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,430
You may be hu-mans,
but you're okay by me.

844
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,848
You don't have
to thank us.

845
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,100
I only hope that one day,

846
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,102
mankind will travel
to the stars

847
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:39,062
and take its place in
a vast alliance of planets.

848
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:41,106
<i>Federation</i> of planets.

849
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:42,481
Excuse me?

850
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:44,276
Uh, don't pay any
attention to him.

851
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:45,902
He's an idiot.

852
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:47,695
Trust me, the galaxy is
a pretty rough place.

853
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,989
You people are much better off
staying right here on Earth.

854
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,324
Let's go, Quark.

855
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:01,334
"A vast alliance
of planets."

856
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:03,753
You get
the craziest ideas.

857
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:26,443
What do we do
now, General?

858
00:41:26,443 --> 00:41:28,236
About what, Captain?

859
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:32,198
All we ever found
was a crashed weather balloon.

860
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,661
Now, tell me again.

861
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:38,871
What's going to happen
when we get there?

862
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:40,832
We fly straight into
the atomic explosion,

863
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:43,335
expose the kemacite
to the beta radiation,

864
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:45,211
and engage the warp engines.

865
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,797
If we have enough kemacite,
we should be able

866
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:50,758
to create a reverse time warp
and ride it home.

867
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:53,052
My dad-- always thinking.

868
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,429
If this doesn't work,

869
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:57,598
I'm holding you
personally responsible.

870
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:00,518
I don't remember inviting
you on this trip.

871
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,645
ROM:
We're at the target site.

872
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,897
Hold on.

873
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:16,409
I don't like this!

874
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:18,995
Rom, tell your brother
it's going to be all right.

875
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:21,664
It's going to be
all right, Brother.

876
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,124
I hope.

877
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,145
Did we make it?

878
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:47,023
This doesn't look
like the Divine Treasury.

879
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:49,442
What year is this?
Good question.

880
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:52,028
What's that
flashing indicator?

881
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:53,779
We're being hailed!

882
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,198
Answer them, answer them!

883
00:42:56,408 --> 00:42:57,742
This is Earth Orbital Control

884
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:59,994
to the unidentified
Ferengi vessel.

885
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,662
Do you need assistance?

886
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,540
Yes! Definitely!

887
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:07,043
We'll send a ship to tractor you
to a docking facility.

888
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:08,711
We'll be waiting.

889
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:11,381
Well, son,
it looks like you're

890
00:43:11,381 --> 00:43:13,216
going to get to Starfleet
Academy after all.

891
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:15,301
QUARK:
Just remember--

892
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,803
under that placid
Federation veneer,

893
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:20,223
humans are still
a bunch of violent savages.

894
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:23,642
Maybe... but I like them.

895
00:43:34,237 --> 00:43:36,114
Oh, it's good to be home.

896
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:38,575
I bet you can't wait
to see the bar again.

897
00:43:38,575 --> 00:43:40,743
The bar?
I could have ruled
the galaxy.

898
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,203
But now I have nothing.

899
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:44,456
I don't even have
my ship anymore.

900
00:43:44,456 --> 00:43:46,207
Look on the bright side,
Brother.

901
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:48,376
You may have had to sell
your shuttle for salvage,

902
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:50,878
but at least you got enough
for our passage home.

903
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:53,131
Wait till I get my
hands on Cousin Gaila.

904
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:54,882
You're going to have
to wait longer than you think.

905
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:57,343
Let's go.
What are you doing?

906
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,095
Taking you
to a holding cell.

907
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:01,139
Kemacite smuggling
is a serious offense.

908
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:02,890
But you have
no evidence.

909
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,517
We used all the rest
of the kemacite

910
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:06,436
to get back to
the 24th century.

911
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:08,813
Tell it
to the arbiter.

912
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:10,273
I'm innocent,
I tell you.

913
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:12,275
This is all
a misunderstanding.

914
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:13,318
Rom, get me a lawyer.

915
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:15,320
I'll contact Cousin Gaila.

916
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,946
I'm sure he'll know a good one.

917
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:18,948
Rom, you idiot!

918
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:21,951
See you in
a few weeks, Brother.
