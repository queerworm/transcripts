1
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:05,881
GARAK:
What a waste of a morning.

2
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:07,883
That Galipotan freighter
that was scheduled

3
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:10,636
to be here at 0700
still hasn't arrived.

4
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:12,346
Oh, well, that's the price

5
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:13,848
for doing business
with a culture

6
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:16,350
that refuses to even acknowledge
the concept of time.

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,645
Though I must say,
they make magnificent sweaters.

8
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:22,063
I hope I'm not
boring you, Doctor.

9
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:23,524
Oh, not at all.

10
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,359
No, I-I was just
up late last night.

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,027
Entertaining one
of your lady friends?

12
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,487
Unfortunately not.

13
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:30,572
No, I was reading
the last few chapters

14
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,491
of<i> The Never-ending</i>
<i>Sacrifice.</i>

15
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:34,326
Isn't it superb?

16
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:35,703
Without a doubt

17
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:37,872
the finest Cardassian
novel ever written.

18
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:40,415
I'll take your word for it.

19
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,334
So, you didn't enjoy it?

20
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:45,671
Well, I-I thought
it was interesting.

21
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:48,799
Maybe a little
dull in parts.

22
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,010
Oh, wonderful!

23
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,220
At this rate, we'll be
done eating lunch

24
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,473
just in time for dinner.
Well, there's always Quark's.

25
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,433
True, but I'm really
not in the mood

26
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,519
for noisy, crowded
and vulgar today.

27
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:03,438
I suppose the Klingon restaurant
is out of the question.

28
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:06,441
I can't believe
that I'm having lunch
with a man who thinks

29
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:09,277
<i>The Never-ending</i>
<i>Sacrifice</i> is dull.

30
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:12,823
I just thought the story got a
little redundant after a while.

31
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:15,409
I mean, the author's
supposed to be chronicling

32
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,411
seven generations
of a single family,

33
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,414
but he tells the same story
over and over again.

34
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,666
All of his characters
lead selfless lives

35
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:25,335
of duty to the state,
grow old and die.

36
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,838
Then, the next generation
comes along and does it
all over again.

37
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,423
But that's exactly the point,
Doctor.

38
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:32,133
The repetitive epic
is the most elegant form

39
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,928
in Cardassian literature,

40
00:01:33,928 --> 00:01:37,723
and<i> The Never-ending Sacrifice</i>
is its greatest achievement.

41
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:40,059
But none of his characters
ever really come alive.

42
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:43,437
And there's more to life
than duty to the state.

43
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:46,774
A Federation viewpoint
if ever I heard one.

44
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:49,985
This is ridiculous.
Can't you just move to
the front of the line?

45
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:52,320
Tell them it's a medical
emergency or something.

46
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,572
We'll be there
in a minute.

47
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:55,449
Look, maybe if you
lent me another book

48
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:56,533
by a different writer...

49
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,410
It would only be
a waste of time.

50
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,288
When it comes to art,
you're obviously a prisoner

51
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,498
of Federation dogma
and human prejudice.

52
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,251
I'm sorry you feel that way.

53
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,378
I was just trying...
(<i> inhales sharply</i> )

54
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,380
Are you all right?
I'm fine.

55
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,007
You don't look fine.

56
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:14,175
Your skin is clammy
and your pupils have contracted.

57
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:16,303
I assure you,
I'm in perfect health.

58
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:19,723
Now you were asking
about other Cardassian books.

59
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:22,434
Something maybe
a little more access...

60
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:25,479
Perfect health.
Then Cardassian standards

61
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,273
must be a little lower
than mine. Come on.

62
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,358
Doctor, what do you
think you're doing?

63
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,402
I'm taking you
to the Infirmary.

64
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,113
That won't be necessary.

65
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:35,781
Well, maybe not, but humor me.

66
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:38,366
Frankly, Doctor...

67
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,619
I'm a little tired
of humoring you.

68
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:42,955
Now, there's nothing
wrong with me

69
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:46,249
that a little peace and
privacy wouldn't cure.

70
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,626
Now, if you'll excuse me

71
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:50,004
I seem to have
lost my appetite.

72
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:55,509
What was that all about?

73
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:59,805
I have no idea.

74
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:02,510
Can you tell
what's wrong with it?

75
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,554
In my expert
medical opinion,

76
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,307
I'd say it's... sick.

77
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:11,436
I know that, but
why is it sick?

78
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,730
I'm a doctor,
not a botanist.

79
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,983
Did you ask
Professor O'Brien?

80
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:18,652
Keiko's at a hydroponics
conference on Rigel IV.

81
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,570
She won't be
back for a week.

82
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,738
And none of your past hosts

83
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,698
have had any experience
with plants?

84
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,201
Daxes have never
been much on gardening.

85
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:29,079
Tobin was the only one
who ever tried
his hand at it,

86
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,831
but he had even less
luck with plants

87
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,082
than he did with women.

88
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,251
Do you even know
where it's from?

89
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,335
I picked it up
on Ledonia III.

90
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,465
May I?

91
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,383
Be my guest.

92
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,348
Oh, that explains it.

93
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:52,393
Ledonian soil contains
a benevolent mycorizal fungus

94
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,479
that helps the native plants
retain water.

95
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,899
The fungus in this potting soil
has almost completely died out.

96
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,651
But if we can salvage
what's left,

97
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,528
and cultivate a new batch
in the lab,

98
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,946
that should do the trick.

99
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,405
Keiko would be
proud of you.

100
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,200
It's all there
on the screen.

101
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,161
I only wish my humanoid patients
were as easy to treat.

102
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:12,080
Did Chief O'Brien
dislocate his
shoulder again?

103
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,372
No, it's Garak.

104
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:14,749
Today at lunch,
he seemed as though

105
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,584
he was going to have
some kind of seizure.

106
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,003
He was having
trouble breathing

107
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:20,005
and he appeared to be
in a great deal of pain.

108
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:22,049
But when I tried to get him
to come to the Infirmary,

109
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,800
he outright refused.

110
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,136
Maybe he just doesn't like
going to see the doctor.

111
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,721
Ah, that's not it.

112
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,724
It's that damned Cardassian
evasiveness of his.

113
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,268
I mean, keeping me guessing
about his past is one thing,

114
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:36,688
but when it comes
to his health,
I don't know.

115
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,775
Why can't he just tell me
what's going on?

116
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,819
It sounds like you're
taking this personally.

117
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,322
I suppose I am.
It's just that Garak and I

118
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,782
have been having
lunch together once a week
for more than a year now.

119
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,284
You'd think he'd come
to trust me a little.

120
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:50,952
Why should he?

121
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,662
It's not like the two of you
are really friends.

122
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,373
Well, no, of course not.

123
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:56,708
I suppose
when it comes right down to it,

124
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,417
I don't trust him either.

125
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:00,379
I mean, for all I know,
the man is a Cardassian spy.

126
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:02,256
Exactly.
Exactly.

127
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:05,217
And if he doesn't want my help
that's his prerogative.

128
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:29,324
(<i> indistinct conversation</i> )

129
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,659
So, I take it, we
understand each other.

130
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:35,122
Garak, how long have you
been living on this station?

131
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:36,831
Too long.

132
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,500
And in all that time,
have I ever let you down?

133
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,586
I have never done business
with you until now.

134
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,631
Which is why this deal
is so important to me.

135
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:48,969
I want our business relationship
to get off on the right foot.

136
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,304
Now relax.

137
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,847
You'll get your merchandise.
Soon, Quark.

138
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,849
I can't wait much longer.

139
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:01,189
You and Garak
going into business?

140
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:05,026
I couldn't help overhearing
your conversation.

141
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,195
Oh, that.
I'm helping Garak

142
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,990
get a new sizing scanner
for his shop.

143
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,658
A sizing scanner.

144
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,327
Not just any
sizing scanner.

145
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,536
The best,
straight from Merak II.

146
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:18,748
Calibrated to be accurate
down to the micrometer

147
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:22,085
and I might add,
at a very reasonable price.

148
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:25,255
Really? I thought Garak
sounded a bit upset.

149
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:26,589
Upset? Garak?

150
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,716
Oh, I hadn't noticed.

151
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:32,637
Now, is there anything
I can do for you, hmm?

152
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,432
A little Saurian
brandy to go,

153
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:40,228
or maybe a late-night
session in a holosuite?

154
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,647
No, thank you.

155
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:45,192
I think I'll
call it a night.

156
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,068
Suit yourself.

157
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,288
There, how does that feel?

158
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,207
Much better.

159
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:04,169
Well, try not to
yell at any more
admirals for a while.

160
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,879
I wasn't yelling.

161
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,548
I was just expressing
my feelings, loudly.

162
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,591
Chief.
Commander.

163
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,427
You wanted to see me?

164
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:13,761
Ah, yes.

165
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,555
I was hoping
you could give me a hand.

166
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,474
I've been trying to access
the old Cardassian medical files

167
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,017
but I haven't been
having much luck.

168
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,519
I'm not surprised.

169
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,687
The Cardassians
did a general systems sweep

170
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,105
before they pulled out.

171
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,358
The medical files
would have been deleted

172
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,068
along with everything else.

173
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,611
Is there any way
to recover them?

174
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,113
Maybe.

175
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:35,283
These subroutines don't
look anywhere near as bad

176
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,951
as the engineering
files did.

177
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,162
I might be able
to reconstruct the data

178
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,206
by micro-scanning
the purge trace.

179
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:42,790
Well, how long
will that take?

180
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,252
Mmm. Two, maybe
three weeks.

181
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:49,005
Ah. Well, that
settles that.

182
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,258
Thank you anyway, Chief.

183
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,301
I'm sorry I couldn't
be of any more help.

184
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,011
Quark to Bashir.

185
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,513
This is Bashir.

186
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,057
Doctor, I need you
in my bar right away.

187
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,275
Oh, come on, Garak.

188
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,902
Don't you think
you've had enough?

189
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:12,237
On the contrary.

190
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,905
Anyone
who talks about

191
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:16,533
the numbing effects
of your liquor

192
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:19,702
is severely overstating
the case, huh?

193
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,122
What's all this?

194
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,998
He came in complaining
about a headache.

195
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,543
The next thing I knew,
he drank up
half my stock of<i> kanar.</i>

196
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:32,090
Oh, Doctor,
what a pleasant surprise.

197
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,175
I apologize
for my outburst at lunch,

198
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,761
but I promise
I'll make it up to you.

199
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,431
Please, join me.

200
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,518
I think I will.
May I?

201
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:44,811
By all means.

202
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,438
<i>What</i> are you doing?!

203
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:49,524
I<i> think</i> it's
a little noisy in here.

204
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:52,693
Um, I'd prefer to drink
somewhere quiet.

205
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:55,655
Why, an excellent idea.

206
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,575
We'll go to my quarters.

207
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,368
Whatever you want.

208
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:04,372
But, first, I must make
a stop at the Infirmary.

209
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,999
The Infirmary?

210
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,335
(<i> chuckling</i> ):
Oh, my dear Doctor.

211
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:11,338
What kind of fool
do you take me for?

212
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,340
Now, give me back my bottle.

213
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:17,344
Give me my bottle back.

214
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,678
I will...
in the Infirmary.

215
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:22,056
I'm not going
to the Infirmary

216
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,976
and I refuse to play
this ridiculous game.

217
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:26,769
Now, give me...

218
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,148
Give...

219
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:37,614
Make it stop, make it stop.

220
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,908
Bashir to Ops.
Medical emergency.

221
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,701
Two to beam to the Infirmary.

222
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,454
Energize.

223
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:54,797
ODO:
Some kind of implant?

224
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,591
Apparently.
What's it for?

225
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:58,677
Well, I was hoping
you could tell me.

226
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:00,970
After working for
the Cardassians for five years

227
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,306
I'd guess you'd know them
as well as anyone.

228
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,183
Maybe so, but
I never bothered

229
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,352
to look inside
their skulls.
No, I don't suppose you did.

230
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:10,771
Do you think
this is the cause
of Garak's condition?

231
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,899
It's possible.
I mean, whatever
this thing is,

232
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,733
it's situated
in his postcentral gyrus

233
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,236
and has filaments
that connect it

234
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,987
to his entire
central nervous system.

235
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,823
Maybe it's some kind
of punishment device--

236
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,451
a parting gift from
the Cardassian government.

237
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,828
I thought of that
but based on
the amount of scarring

238
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,623
in the surrounding tissue
this implant's
been in there for years.

239
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:32,043
And as far as I can tell,
Garak's only been in pain
for the past few days.

240
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,670
Interesting.

241
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,797
I wish I had an answer
for you, Doctor.

242
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:39,634
Well, I was hoping
you could help me get one.

243
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:42,303
I think Quark knows
what this thing is.

244
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,138
Now, what makes you say that?

245
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,140
I overheard them talking
the other night.

246
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,393
Garak was negotiating to buy
some merchandise from Quark.

247
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,103
He seemed quite desperate.

248
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,522
I tried to ask Quark
what it was about, but...

249
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,274
No need to explain, Doctor.

250
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:58,111
The direct approach seldom
works with people like him.

251
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:01,239
But this could answer
some of my own questions.

252
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:05,076
Quark has sent several coded
messages to Cardassia Prime

253
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:06,703
in the past few days.

254
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,079
Really?

255
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,372
Mmm. I routinely monitor

256
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,666
all of Quark's
subspace communications.

257
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,001
Is that legal?

258
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,795
It's in the best interest
of station security.

259
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:18,797
Doctor, do you
want to know

260
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:20,925
what Quark knows or not?

261
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,801
I see your point.

262
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:25,430
Then meet me in Security
at 0200 hours.

263
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,349
Quark always makes
his clandestine calls

264
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,017
after the bar closes.

265
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,561
I wouldn't miss it.

266
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,448
Quark, you parasite.

267
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,533
It's been too long.

268
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:49,162
Is Hartla still working for you?

269
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:52,039
The dabo tables wouldn't
be the same without her.

270
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:55,209
Oh, what I wouldn't
give to see her again.

271
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,044
I'm sure she misses you, too.

272
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,046
(<i> both laughing</i> )

273
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,799
I'll bet she does.

274
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,258
Yeah.

275
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,968
She would have bankrupted me

276
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,805
if the occupation would
have lasted much longer.

277
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:10,725
But I'm sure you didn't
contact me just to reminisce.

278
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:13,019
What can I do for you?

279
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,105
How would you like to earn
a little extra latinum?

280
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,857
Enough to buy yourself
a promotion?

281
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:21,152
You have my undivided attention.

282
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:24,197
I need a piece
of Cardassian bio-technology

283
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:27,408
and the schematics relating
to its installation.

284
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,619
Hmm, bio-technology, huh?

285
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:32,622
Why, that shouldn't be
too difficult.

286
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,123
What is it?

287
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:38,211
You know, I never ask
those kinds of questions,

288
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:42,089
but I've got
the requisition code number.

289
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,551
Well, give it to me.
I'll look for it.

290
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,093
I knew I could count on you.
Here it is.

291
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:49,180
I hope you don't have
one of these little bugs

292
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,390
hidden
in my quarters.

293
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,725
Should I?

294
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,560
QUARK:
Transmission complete.

295
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,146
Hold on.
This won't take long.

296
00:14:57,146 --> 00:15:00,024
Take your time.

297
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,281
Quark, you idiot!

298
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,491
Is something wrong?

299
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,326
Is something wrong?!

300
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,619
I'm ruined!

301
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,079
My career is over!

302
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,914
What did I do?!

303
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,083
You and your damned
requisition code.

304
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,126
It's for classified
bio-technology, Quark.

305
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,003
Even the cursed number
is classified.

306
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,338
Where did you get it?!

307
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,340
No, don't tell me!

308
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,968
I don't want to know.

309
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,430
If I'm lucky,
I can still get through this

310
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,014
with my skin intact.

311
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:35,184
Maybe they won't trace
the request back to me.

312
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,477
Who won't?

313
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:41,107
The Obsidian Order.

314
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,526
Nice talking to you, Boheeka.

315
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,653
We'll have to do it

316
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,739
again sometime.

317
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,575
The Obsidian Order.

318
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,660
That certainly
complicates things.

319
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,078
Who are they?

320
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,205
They're the ever-
vigilant eyes and ears

321
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,791
of the Cardassian Empire.

322
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,209
It is said that
a Cardassian citizen

323
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,753
cannot sit down to a meal

324
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:04,088
without each dish
being duly noted

325
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,799
and recorded by the Order.

326
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,759
What happens if
you eat something

327
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,719
that doesn't meet
with their approval?

328
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:12,847
People have been known
to disappear for less.

329
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:15,642
Whether you agree with
their goals or not,

330
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:19,437
you can't help but
admire their... efficiency.

331
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:23,316
Even the Romulan Tal Shiar
can't compete with them

332
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:26,277
when it comes to
intelligence gathering
and covert operations.

333
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:28,404
What has all this
to do with Garak?

334
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,072
I wish I knew.

335
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,991
Do you think the Order

336
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,410
put that implant
inside Garak's head?

337
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,995
I have a better question.

338
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,456
If the implant
is a punishment device,

339
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:42,543
then why is Garak trying
to get his hands on another one?

340
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,629
He did asked for specifications.

341
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:48,007
Maybe he's trying to find
some way of removing it.

342
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,342
Well, either way,
I'd like to have

343
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,927
a talk with him
when he wakes up.

344
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,595
You'll have to get in line.

345
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:55,515
Thank you,
Constable.

346
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:02,981
Computer, report on the status
of patient Garak.

347
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:04,482
COMPUTER:
Patient Garak

348
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:06,275
is no longer in the Infirmary.

349
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,485
What?

350
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:08,820
When did he leave?

351
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:13,032
Patient checked out
at 0320 hours.

352
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,550
(<i> door chimes</i> )

353
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:34,345
Garak, are you in there?

354
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:35,680
Computer, open the door

355
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,974
to Chamber 901,
Habitat Level H-3.

356
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:40,894
Emergency medical override,
Bashir 1-Alpha.

357
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:46,691
Ah, Doctor,
what a pleasant surprise.

358
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:49,151
I'm sorry, I must have
missed the door chime.

359
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,528
What the hell do you
think you're doing?!

360
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:51,738
Triptacederine?

361
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,406
How much of this
did you take?

362
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,826
A mere 30cc's--
not nearly enough, I'm afraid.

363
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,537
30cc's would anesthetize
an Algorian mammoth.

364
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:02,916
Oh, we Cardassians must
be made of sterner stuff.

365
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,167
I barely feel it.
Listen to me, Garak.

366
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,086
I've had just about enough
of your nonsense.

367
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,380
Now you're coming back
to the Infirmary with me.

368
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,049
Oh, I don't think so.

369
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:12,800
Believe me when I tell you

370
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,135
there's nothing
you can do for me.

371
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,721
Oh, and Quark can, is that it?

372
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:19,891
I thought I was
supposed to be the spy.

373
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:21,475
Quark's not coming, Garak.

374
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,810
How do you know?

375
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,062
I heard him talking

376
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:26,188
to his Cardassian
contact.

377
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,274
He couldn't get
the item you requested.

378
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,734
Really?

379
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:32,528
That's most distressing,

380
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:36,741
but I suppose
not all that surprising.

381
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:42,622
Ah, well,
maybe it's for the best.

382
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:46,542
My hypospray, if you please.

383
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,962
Another dose of triptacederine
might kill you.

384
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,630
Thank you for your concern,
Doctor,

385
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,673
but I'd rather
have the hypospray.

386
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,759
I'm not going to let you
commit suicide.

387
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:58,012
I'm here to help you.
I doubt you can!

388
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:05,019
I think you'll find
that I'm experiencing

389
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:09,107
some slight deterioration
of my cranial nerve cluster.

390
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:10,483
It's not so slight, I'm afraid.

391
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,944
We've got to get you
to the Infirmary.

392
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:14,654
(<i> laughing</i> ):
My dear Doctor,

393
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,323
I have no intention
of putting myself on display

394
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:20,618
for the amusement of the Bajoran
inhabitants of this station.

395
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:23,704
It's not your pride
I'm worried about.
It's that implant

396
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,790
you're carrying around
inside your head.

397
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,625
You know about that, do you?

398
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,710
It's some sort
of punishment
device, isn't it?

399
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,212
Punishment device?

400
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,256
(<i> laughing</i> )

401
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:38,678
Well, I suppose, in a way,
that's what it's become.

402
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,638
If it wasn't put there
to punish you,

403
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:41,973
then what's it for?

404
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:46,894
Garak! I need to know
what we're up against.

405
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,022
If you tell me what it's for,

406
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,898
maybe I could find
some way to remove it.

407
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,733
It's hopeless, Doctor.

408
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,819
Believe me,
it can't be removed.

409
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:55,820
How do you know?

410
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,279
That's the whole point.

411
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:01,742
If it could be easily removed,
it would be useless.

412
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:05,079
You see, on Cardassia,

413
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:07,957
I was entrusted
with certain information--

414
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:10,543
information that needed
to be kept safe

415
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,461
regardless of the situation.

416
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,673
My implant was given to me
by Enabran Tain himself--

417
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,842
the head of the Obsidian Order.

418
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:20,469
If I was ever tortured,

419
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,639
it was designed to stimulate
the pleasure centers of my brain

420
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,307
to trigger the production

421
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,894
of vast amounts
of natural endorphins.

422
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:30,938
I do hope you appreciate
the irony, Doctor.

423
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:35,317
The whole purpose of the implant
was to make me immune to pain.

424
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,111
What caused it to malfunction?

425
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:42,992
It was never meant
for continuous use.

426
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,786
Continuous use.
What do you mean?

427
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:52,585
Living on this station
is torture for me, Doctor.

428
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:56,296
The temperature
is always too cold.

429
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,841
The lights always too bright.

430
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,219
Every Bajoran on the station

431
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:04,847
looks at me
with loathing and contempt.

432
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:11,020
So, one day, I decided
I couldn't live with it anymore,

433
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,148
and I took the pain away.

434
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:16,483
You activated the implant.

435
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:19,028
I created a device
which allowed me

436
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:22,240
to trigger the implant
whenever I wanted it.

437
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,743
At first, I only used it
a few minutes a day,

438
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:28,996
but then I began relying
on it more and more,

439
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,665
until, finally,
I just turned it on

440
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,375
and never shut it off.

441
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,629
How long has it been on?
Two years.

442
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:40,133
And now the implant
is breaking down.
That's correct.

443
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:42,301
So, why don't you just shut
the damn thing off?

444
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,636
It's too late now.

445
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:46,139
My body has become
completely dependent

446
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:50,143
on the higher endorphin levels
generated by the implant.

447
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,437
So, that's it then.

448
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:56,398
You're just going to give up
and let them win.

449
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,067
"Them," Doctor?

450
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,111
The Central Command,
the Obsidian Order--

451
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:02,446
whoever it is who
exiled you here.

452
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,657
You're just going
to roll over and die,
let them destroy you,

453
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,492
give up any hope of ever
seeing Cardassia again.

454
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,202
Doctor, did anyone
ever tell you

455
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:09,620
that you are
an infuriating pest?

456
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,622
Chief O'Brien,
all the time,

457
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:14,000
and I don't pay
any attention
to him, either.

458
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,501
Has it ever occurred
to you

459
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:17,795
that I might be getting
exactly what I deserve?

460
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:19,172
No one deserves this.

461
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:22,091
Oh, please, Doctor,
I'm suffering enough

462
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,550
without having to listen

463
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,928
to your smug
Federation sympathy.

464
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:28,472
Do you think that, because
we have lunch together

465
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,348
once a week, you know me?

466
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:34,979
You couldn't even begin
to fathom what I'm capable of.

467
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:38,149
I'm a doctor.
You're my patient.

468
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:40,943
That's all I need to know.

469
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:42,862
Wrong again.

470
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:46,699
You need to know
who you're trying to save.

471
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,828
During the occupation,

472
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:54,707
I was a Gul in the Cardassian
mechanized infantry.

473
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:57,835
We were stationed just
outside the Bajoran capital.

474
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,545
Shortly before the withdrawal,

475
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:03,132
a handful of Bajoran prisoners
escaped from my custody.

476
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:04,925
My aide, a man named Elim,

477
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,760
tracked them
to a Cardassian shuttle

478
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,348
about to depart for Terok Nor.
Elim got aboard,

479
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:12,683
but the Captain refused
to let him search the ship

480
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:15,728
because he claimed he was under
strict orders from Gul Dukat

481
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,395
to depart immediately.

482
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:20,524
So, I had the shuttle destroyed,

483
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:27,073
killing the escapees, Elim,
and 97 Cardassian civilians.

484
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:29,909
You can't be serious.

485
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:32,119
I followed my orders.

486
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:37,291
None of those prisoners
escaped off of Bajor alive.

487
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:40,044
Unfortunately,
as it turned out,

488
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:43,005
one of the passengers
on the shuttle was the daughter

489
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:44,965
of a prominent
military official.

490
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,718
I was stripped of
my rank and commission,

491
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:50,054
and exiled from Cardassia.

492
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,143
So, now you know, Doctor.

493
00:23:56,143 --> 00:24:02,358
I hope... I haven't shattered
too many of your illusions.

494
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:07,196
Listen to me, Garak.

495
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:09,698
Right now, I'm
not concerned

496
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,409
with what you
did in the past.

497
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:13,994
I'm simply not going
to walk out of here

498
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,037
and let you die.

499
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:17,206
We need to turn
that implant off

500
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:19,666
and whatever
withdrawal symptoms

501
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,835
or side effects
you may experience,

502
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:24,504
I promise I'll help
you through them.

503
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:30,219
I need to know where
that triggering device is.

504
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:31,929
Where is it?

505
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:37,268
The desk, second drawer.

506
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,454
Well, that will be all for now.

507
00:24:56,454 --> 00:24:58,622
If you need to reach me,
I'll be here

508
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,166
for at least the next 26 hours.

509
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,959
Computer, I'm reading
an ongoing erosion

510
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:05,004
of tissue in the patient's
lymphatic system. Explain.

511
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,797
COMPUTER:
Unable to determine a cause

512
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:08,090
due to insufficient data

513
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,384
on Cardassian physiology.

514
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:12,636
All right.
Continue to monitor the status

515
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,263
of the patient's
cranial implant.

516
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,390
Inform me if it shows
any sign of reactivation.

517
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,891
(<i> door chimes</i> )

518
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,185
Yes?

519
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:20,936
Doctor.

520
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,939
I was hoping I could ask
Garak some questions.

521
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,858
He's asleep.

522
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:28,610
He has been ever since
I turned off his implant.

523
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,738
Now, come on,
we can talk outside.

524
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:33,699
Doctor, I need to talk to him
as soon as possible.

525
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:36,118
I have four cases left
in my homicide files

526
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:38,620
which I'm almost certain
were committed

527
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,788
by the Obsidian Order.

528
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,123
If Garak was a member,

529
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:43,667
he may be able
to shed some light on them.

530
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,752
I'm afraid your questions
will have to wait.

531
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,629
How long?

532
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,507
I don't know yet.

533
00:25:49,507 --> 00:25:51,758
Constable, Garak's body
has undergone a severe shock.

534
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:53,635
I don't know
when he'll recover.

535
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:56,722
I'm not even sure
if he'll recover.

536
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,891
In that case,
I want to talk to him now.

537
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:01,185
Wake him up.
I'll do no such thing.

538
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:05,647
Doctor, these are murder cases,
and Garak may be a suspect.

539
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:08,025
That may be so,
but he's still my patient,

540
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:10,027
and I'll not
have him disturbed.

541
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:12,821
So, until further notice,
his quarters are off limits

542
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,781
to everyone except emergency
medical personnel.

543
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:18,285
So, if you'll excuse me,
I have a patient to attend to.

544
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,888
(<i> groans softly</i> )

545
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:47,749
(<i> sobbing</i> )

546
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,425
Garak?
Leave me alone.

547
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:58,093
I don't think that would be
a good idea right now.

548
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:00,220
Your blood chemistry
is severely imbalanced.

549
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,430
You need to rest.

550
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,140
Don't touch me.

551
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,475
Just calm down.

552
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:07,227
I don't want to
calm down, Doctor.

553
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,813
I've been calm long enough.

554
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,482
Look at this place.

555
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:13,108
It's pathetic.

556
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:16,903
To think that this is what
my life has been reduced to.

557
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:20,616
This sterile shell,
this...<i> prison.</i>

558
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:22,535
Take it easy, Garak.

559
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:24,328
Look, you're obviously
experiencing some side effects

560
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:26,704
from the deactivation
of the implant.

561
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:27,914
Ridiculous.

562
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:29,249
I feel more clearheaded

563
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:32,752
than I have in the
past two years.

564
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:37,591
Two years-- what a waste
these past two years have been.

565
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,678
There was a
time, Doctor.

566
00:28:40,678 --> 00:28:43,763
Oh! There was a time
when I was a power.

567
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:46,725
The protégé of
Enabran Tain himself.

568
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,269
Do you have any idea
what that means?

569
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,604
I'm afraid I don't.

570
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:52,064
No, you don't, do you?

571
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:54,316
You don't know
much of anything.

572
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:55,942
Tain<i> was</i> the Obsidian Order.

573
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:59,196
Not even the Central Command
dared challenge him,

574
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:01,156
and I was his right hand.

575
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,616
My future was limitless

576
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:05,785
until I threw it away.

577
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,746
You mean when you had
that shuttle shot down

578
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,415
to stop those prisoners
from escaping?

579
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:12,000
Stopped them.
I only wish that
I had stopped them.

580
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,502
You didn't?

581
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:16,296
No, Doctor, my disgrace
is worse than that.

582
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,131
Unimaginably worse.

583
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:21,009
What could you have
possibly done worse than that?

584
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,512
I let them go.

585
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:27,182
It was the eve of the
Cardassian withdrawal.

586
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:30,728
Elim and I were
interrogating five Bajorans.

587
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:32,563
They were<i> children,</i> Doctor!

588
00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:35,190
None of them were older
than 14 years old.

589
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,400
They knew nothing.

590
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,277
They lived in bombed-out rooms,

591
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,571
scrounged for food
on the streets.

592
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:42,489
They were filthy and they stank.

593
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:47,244
The room was freezing cold,
the air was like ice,

594
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:51,164
and suddenly the whole exercise
seemed utterly meaningless.

595
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,250
All I wanted was a hot bath,

596
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,753
(<i> laughing</i> ):
and a good meal.

597
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,925
And so I let them go.

598
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:04,344
I gave them whatever latinum
I had in my pockets,

599
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,638
and opened the door

600
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:08,515
and flung them back
into the streets.

601
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,726
Elim couldn't believe his eyes.

602
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:14,521
He looked at me
as if I were insane.

603
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,273
You took pity on those children.

604
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:18,358
There's nothing wrong with that.

605
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,068
No! I was a fool!

606
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,028
I should have completed
my interrogation,

607
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:25,324
and turned them over
to the troops for execution,

608
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:28,285
but because I was chilly
and my stomach was growling,

609
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:29,911
I failed in my duty,

610
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,914
and destroyed everything
I had worked for.

611
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,833
And so they exiled you.

612
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,710
That's right.

613
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:41,757
And left me to live out my days
with nothing to look forward to

614
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:44,843
but having lunch with you.

615
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,220
Well, I'm sorry
you feel that way.

616
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,556
I thought
you enjoyed my company.

617
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,559
Oh, I did,
and that's the worst part.

618
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,978
I can't believe that
I actually enjoyed

619
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,230
eating mediocre food

620
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,900
and staring into your
smug, sanctimonious face.

621
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:06,031
I hate this place,
and I hate you.

622
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,867
Okay, Garak,
that's your prerogative.

623
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:12,078
Now, I really think
you should lie down.

624
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,913
Get away from me!

625
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,290
Garak...

626
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,583
(<i> yelling</i> )

627
00:31:19,712 --> 00:31:21,880
(<i> grunting</i> )

628
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,215
Garak, stop this.

629
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:25,592
I don't want to hurt you.

630
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,849
Bashir to Infirmary.

631
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:35,602
I need an emergency medical team
in Garak's quarters now.

632
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:42,609
Administer another
20cc's of hyperzine.

633
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,196
He's not responding.
Give it a second.

634
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:48,281
Begin cardiostimulation.

635
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:51,034
His heartbeat
is stabilizing.

636
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:55,330
But his lymphatic system
is still critical.
I don't understand it.

637
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,876
I shut down the implant.
It can't be affecting
his blood chemistry.

638
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:00,878
Yet toxins are
still accumulating

639
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:03,046
in his lymphatic tissues.

640
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:06,216
Computer, display analysis
of all biochemical samples

641
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:09,010
taken from the patient
in the past 39 hours.

642
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:12,723
Display them
by chemical composition.

643
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:17,686
Isolate and display
sample number... 17.

644
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:22,982
Bring up sample 23.

645
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:25,110
Sample 27.

646
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:28,280
Sample 32.

647
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:31,909
Sample 35.

648
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:35,829
Sample 40.
Stop.

649
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:38,164
Bring back sample 35.

650
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,920
Superimpose the molecular
structure of this leukocyte

651
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,130
with an analogous sample
taken from yesterday.

652
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:49,927
That's it.

653
00:32:49,927 --> 00:32:51,887
The molecular structure
of Garak's leukocytes

654
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:53,889
has been altered.
That must be what's causing

655
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:55,724
the accumulation
of toxins in his system.

656
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:57,142
Can we synthesize
Cardassian leukocytes?

657
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:58,811
Probably, but that
could take weeks,

658
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:00,270
and we don't have
that much time.

659
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,855
We have three
or four days at most.

660
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:03,607
If we turned
the implant back on,

661
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:05,859
we might be able
to keep him alive
another week or two.

662
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:08,027
GARAK:
No.
What?

663
00:33:11,782 --> 00:33:13,408
I won't allow it.

664
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,911
I never want that thing
turned on again.

665
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:17,746
I understand how you feel,

666
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:20,415
but I'm not sure what
else I can do for you.

667
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:25,504
Oh, you've done enough, Doctor,
more than I deserve.

668
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,632
There's something
you have to know.

669
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:30,968
What's that?

670
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:33,136
The truth.

671
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:39,852
I've about given up on learning
the truth from you, Garak.

672
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:43,438
Oh, don't give up
on me now, Doctor.

673
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,732
Patience has its rewards.

674
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:48,568
Now listen carefully.

675
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,946
Elim wasn't my aide.

676
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:54,491
He was... my friend.

677
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:56,869
We grew up together.

678
00:33:56,869 --> 00:33:59,245
We were closer than brothers.

679
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:03,166
For some reason, Enabran Tain
took a liking to us.

680
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,168
Before long,

681
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:08,296
we were both very powerful men
in the Obsidian Order.

682
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,924
They called us
"the sons of Tain."

683
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:14,135
Even the Guls
feared us.

684
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,429
And then there was a scandal.

685
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,682
Someone in the Order was accused

686
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:21,768
of letting some Bajoran
prisoners escape.

687
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:26,523
There were constant rumors of
who was going to be implicated.

688
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:29,192
Fingers were being
pointed at me.

689
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:33,446
By then, Tain had retired
to the Arawath colony.

690
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:37,993
He couldn't protect me,
so I panicked.

691
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:40,662
I did everything in my power

692
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:45,083
to make sure that Elim
was accused instead of me.

693
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:48,879
I altered records,
planted evidence,

694
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:52,841
only to discover
that he'd beaten me to it.

695
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:56,011
He betrayed you first.

696
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:58,096
Elim destroyed me.

697
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:03,727
Before I knew what was going on,
I was sentenced to exile.

698
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:06,354
(<i> chuckles</i> )

699
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:09,858
And the irony is,
I deserved it.

700
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:13,528
Oh, not for the reasons
they claimed,

701
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:19,952
but because of what I had tried
to do to Elim, my best friend.

702
00:35:19,952 --> 00:35:23,455
Why are you telling me this,
Garak?

703
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:26,165
So that you can forgive me.

704
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:28,794
Why else?

705
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:33,840
I need to know
that someone forgives me.

706
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:44,267
I forgive you...

707
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:47,228
for whatever it is you did.

708
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,815
Thank you, Doctor.

709
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:52,317
That's most kind.

710
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,160
See that he rests
comfortably.

711
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,912
I'll be back
within 52 hours.

712
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:05,914
Where are you going?

713
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:08,333
To find the man
responsible for this.

714
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,174
Dr. Bashir.

715
00:36:57,174 --> 00:36:58,842
Welcome.

716
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:01,094
Please, make
yourself at home.

717
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,435
Well, Doctor, you've come
all this way to see me.

718
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:11,855
Aren't you going
to say something?

719
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:13,523
How did you know my name?

720
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:16,151
Information's my business.

721
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:18,570
You're Enabran Tain.

722
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,073
And you're
Dr. Julian Subatoi Bashir.

723
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:23,408
I hope you weren't
greeted too rudely

724
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,451
upon entering
Cardassian space.

725
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:28,038
Not nearly as rudely
as I expected.

726
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:31,208
Good, I alerted them
that you'd be coming.

727
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:33,334
The military hates surprises.

728
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,921
Still what you did
was very brave.

729
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:37,172
I'm impressed.

730
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:40,175
Can I get you
something to drink?

731
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:41,426
Tarkalean tea, perhaps?

732
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:45,180
I always drink
Tarkalean... tea.

733
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:48,266
A good host knows
the needs of his guests.

734
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:52,062
One Tarkalean tea,
extra sweet.

735
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:54,189
And a glass of<i> kanar.</i>

736
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:02,280
So, Lieutenant,
how's Garak?

737
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,742
Has his condition
improved at all?

738
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:08,828
That Cardassian Quark
was talking to, Boheeka,

739
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,747
I suppose he
really did have

740
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:13,041
a reason to fear
the Obsidian Order.

741
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:15,961
Everyone has reason
to fear the Order.

742
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:18,797
I don't understand it.
Garak told me you were retired.

743
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:21,174
Oh, I am.
Have been for years.

744
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:24,010
But I try to keep informed
on current events.

745
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,762
I bet you could tell me

746
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:28,265
all kinds of things
I'd like to know, Doctor.

747
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:30,100
Oh, I'm sure I could.

748
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,060
I'll tell you anything
you want to know

749
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,604
about medicine,
biology, or tennis.

750
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:36,689
Do you want to hear my opinion

751
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:39,067
on the latest nillimite
alloy racket?

752
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:41,402
I don't think
that would be necessary.

753
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,695
Have it your way.

754
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:45,198
Are all the Starfleet
Lieutenants

755
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:46,908
as brash as you are?

756
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:48,785
I couldn't say.

757
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:51,037
Though I doubt it.

758
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,580
So do I.

759
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:57,043
Tell me, Doctor,
how sick is Garak?

760
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,962
He's dying.

761
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:00,546
And you're trying to save him.

762
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:02,757
That's right.
Strange.

763
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:05,593
I thought you were his friend.

764
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,554
I suppose I am.

765
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,556
Then you should let him die.

766
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:14,727
After all, for Garak, a life
in exile is no life at all.

767
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:19,440
Say what you will,
my job is to keep him alive,

768
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,609
and I need your help.

769
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:24,154
My help?
What can I do?

770
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:26,239
The molecular structure
of Garak's leukocytes

771
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,699
has been disrupted.

772
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:29,534
I need to synthesize
replacements

773
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:31,536
in order to stabilize
his condition.

774
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,788
Unfortunately, my knowledge
of Cardassian biochemistry

775
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,999
is severely limited.

776
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:39,460
And you think I have access
to that kind of information?

777
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,088
Information is your business.

778
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,549
Besides,
you're the one who ordered him

779
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:46,718
to put that implant in his head,
aren't you?

780
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:49,346
I never had to order Garak
to do anything.

781
00:39:49,346 --> 00:39:51,597
That's what made
him special.

782
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:53,058
So you're saying that

783
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:55,768
if you don't get the
information, Garak dies.

784
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,103
That's it.

785
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:59,731
Well, we can't
allow that, can we?

786
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:01,774
I'll see to it

787
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:04,069
that all the necessary
data is transferred

788
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:06,112
to your station's computers.

789
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,655
Thank you.

790
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,324
Oh, don't thank me.

791
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:11,784
I'm not doing Garak any favors.

792
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:14,329
He doesn't deserve
a quick death.

793
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:19,209
On the contrary, I want him
to live a long, miserable life.

794
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:22,170
I want him to grow old
on that station

795
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,547
surrounded by people
who hate him,

796
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:28,051
knowing that he'll
never come home again.

797
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:31,137
What a lovely sentiment.

798
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:34,349
And it's from the
heart, I assure you.

799
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:39,104
And now, Doctor, I really
think you should be going.

800
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:40,313
One last thing.

801
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:41,898
Make it brief.

802
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:45,151
Garak mentioned an old friend
of his the other day--

803
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,986
a member
of the Obsidian Order.

804
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:49,197
I was wondering
what happened to him.

805
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:52,242
Did he give you the
name of this friend?

806
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:54,119
He said it was Elim.

807
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,454
(<i> chuckling</i> )

808
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,456
Elim.

809
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,250
Mind letting me
in on the joke?

810
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:03,044
I can see that Garak
hasn't changed a bit.

811
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:05,630
Never tell the truth
when a lie will do.

812
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:09,092
That man has a rare gift
for obfuscation.

813
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:13,805
Doctor, Elim is
Garak's first name.

814
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:17,683
Now run along home.

815
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:21,187
And please, tell Garak
that I miss him.

816
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:27,319
I'll be sure
to give him the message.

817
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:30,822
Computer, one to beam up.

818
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:35,618
Energize.

819
00:41:58,391 --> 00:41:59,558
May I join you?

820
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:00,559
Garak.

821
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:03,188
Thank you.

822
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:05,231
(<i> sighs</i> )

823
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,858
What are you doing up?

824
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:08,651
You're supposed
to be in bed.

825
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,653
Out of the question.

826
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:13,239
I couldn't stand
being cooped up

827
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,116
in that dreadful Infirmary
for another second.

828
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:18,411
Besides, I feel
perfectly fine.

829
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:22,415
So, how's the I'danian
spice pudding today?

830
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:25,543
How's the spice pudding?

831
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,171
Is that all you have
to say for yourself?

832
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:29,964
How can you
just sit there

833
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:32,384
and pretend that the last
ten days never happened?

834
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:36,012
I, for one, Doctor,
am perfectly satisfied

835
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:37,930
with the way
things turned out,

836
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:41,434
and I see no need to dwell
on what was, doubtlessly,

837
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:44,979
a difficult time
for both of us.

838
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:49,526
By the way, I just had the
most interesting conversation

839
00:42:49,526 --> 00:42:51,110
with Constable Odo.

840
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,821
It seems he's
under the impression

841
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:57,158
that I was a member
of the Obsidian Order.

842
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:58,910
What did you tell him?

843
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,287
That he was mistaken,
of course.

844
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,122
And he believed you?

845
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:04,874
Well, he said something

846
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:07,544
about keeping a closer eye on me
in the future.

847
00:43:07,544 --> 00:43:10,922
I told him, "Be my guest.
I have nothing to hide."

848
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:14,300
Here, I've brought you
something.

849
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,801
What is it?

850
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:19,347
<i>Meditations on</i>
<i>a Crimson Shadow,</i>

851
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:20,473
by Preloc.

852
00:43:20,473 --> 00:43:22,975
More Cardassian literature.

853
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:25,770
I think you'll find this one
more to your taste.

854
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:28,606
It takes place in the future,
during a time when Cardassia

855
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,649
and the Klingon Empire
are at war.

856
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:32,026
Who wins?

857
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,278
Who do you think?

858
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:34,779
Never mind.
Don't tell me.

859
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:36,906
I don't want you
to spoil the ending.

860
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:39,409
(<i> laughs</i> )

861
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:43,246
You know, I still have
a lot of questions

862
00:43:43,246 --> 00:43:45,831
to ask you about your past.

863
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:49,043
I've given you all the answers
I'm capable of.

864
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,254
You've given me answers,
all right.

865
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:53,131
But they were all different.

866
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:56,050
What I want to know is, out of
all the stories you've told me,

867
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,344
which ones were true
and which ones weren't?

868
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:02,307
My dear Doctor,
they're all true.

869
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:04,767
Even the lies?

870
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:08,020
Especially the lies.
