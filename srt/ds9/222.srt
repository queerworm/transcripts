1
00:00:04,568 --> 00:00:06,401
What a waste of a morning.

2
00:00:06,437 --> 00:00:08,907
That Galipotan freighter
that was scheduled

3
00:00:08,943 --> 00:00:11,175
to be here at 0700
still hasn't arrived.

4
00:00:11,247 --> 00:00:12,681
Oh, well, that's the price

5
00:00:12,717 --> 00:00:14,584
for doing business
with a culture

6
00:00:14,621 --> 00:00:17,650
that refuses to even acknowledge
the concept of time.

7
00:00:17,694 --> 00:00:20,564
Though I must say,
they make magnificent sweaters.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,536
I hope I'm not
boring you, Doctor.

9
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:23,868
Oh, not at all.

10
00:00:23,906 --> 00:00:25,876
No, I-I was just
up late last night.

11
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,210
Entertaining one
of your lady friends?

12
00:00:28,281 --> 00:00:29,510
Unfortunately not.

13
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:32,182
No, I was reading
the last few chapters

14
00:00:32,222 --> 00:00:34,351
of <i>The Never-ending Sacrifice.</i>

15
00:00:34,393 --> 00:00:35,486
Isn't it superb?

16
00:00:35,529 --> 00:00:36,724
Without a doubt

17
00:00:36,765 --> 00:00:39,396
the finest Cardassian
novel ever written.

18
00:00:39,437 --> 00:00:41,907
I'll take your word for it.

19
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:44,037
So, you didn't enjoy it?

20
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,847
Well, I-I thought
it was interesting.

21
00:00:46,885 --> 00:00:49,185
Maybe a little dull in parts.

22
00:00:49,223 --> 00:00:52,457
Oh, wonderful!

23
00:00:52,496 --> 00:00:54,261
At this rate, we'll be
done eating lunch

24
00:00:54,367 --> 00:00:55,494
just in time for dinner.

25
00:00:55,535 --> 00:00:57,835
Well, there's always Quark's.

26
00:00:57,874 --> 00:00:59,639
True, but I'm really
not in the mood

27
00:00:59,678 --> 00:01:01,841
for noisy, crowded
and vulgar today.

28
00:01:01,882 --> 00:01:04,945
I suppose the Klingon restaurant
is out of the question.

29
00:01:04,988 --> 00:01:06,115
I can't believe

30
00:01:06,157 --> 00:01:07,625
that I'm having lunch
with a man who thinks

31
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,689
<i>The Never-ending</i>
<i>Sacrifice</i> is dull.

32
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:14,194
I just thought the story got a
little redundant after a while.

33
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,837
I mean, the author's
supposed to be chronicling

34
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,849
seven generations
of a single family

35
00:01:18,883 --> 00:01:21,582
but he tells the same story
over and over again.

36
00:01:21,622 --> 00:01:23,990
All of his characters
lead selfless lives

37
00:01:24,026 --> 00:01:26,759
of duty to the state,
grow old and die.

38
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,131
Then, the next generation
comes along

39
00:01:28,168 --> 00:01:29,193
and does it all over again.

40
00:01:29,236 --> 00:01:30,830
But that's exactly the point,
Doctor.

41
00:01:30,873 --> 00:01:33,674
The repetitive epic
is the most elegant form

42
00:01:33,712 --> 00:01:35,238
in Cardassian literature

43
00:01:35,282 --> 00:01:39,086
and <i>The Never-ending Sacrifice</i>
is its greatest achievement.

44
00:01:39,123 --> 00:01:41,286
But none of his characters
ever really come alive.

45
00:01:41,394 --> 00:01:44,628
And there's more to life
than duty to the state.

46
00:01:44,668 --> 00:01:48,163
A Federation viewpoint
if ever I heard one.

47
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,437
This is ridiculous.

48
00:01:49,477 --> 00:01:51,242
Can't you just move
to the front of the line?

49
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,512
Tell them it's a medical
emergency or something.

50
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:54,678
We'll be there in a minute.

51
00:01:54,721 --> 00:01:56,554
Look, maybe if you
lent me another book

52
00:01:56,591 --> 00:01:57,650
by a different writer...

53
00:01:57,694 --> 00:01:59,664
It would only be
a waste of time.

54
00:01:59,698 --> 00:02:02,534
When it comes to art,
you're obviously a prisoner

55
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:04,937
of Federation dogma
and human prejudice.

56
00:02:04,975 --> 00:02:07,468
I'm sorry you feel that way.

57
00:02:07,513 --> 00:02:08,606
I was just trying...

58
00:02:09,651 --> 00:02:10,619
Are you all right?

59
00:02:10,653 --> 00:02:11,780
I'm fine.

60
00:02:11,822 --> 00:02:12,983
You don't look fine.

61
00:02:13,024 --> 00:02:15,494
Your skin is clammy
and your pupils have contracted.

62
00:02:15,529 --> 00:02:17,761
I assure you,
I'm in perfect health.

63
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,034
Now you were asking
about other Cardassian books.

64
00:02:21,073 --> 00:02:23,601
Something maybe
a little more access...

65
00:02:23,646 --> 00:02:25,046
Perfect health.

66
00:02:25,081 --> 00:02:26,641
Then Cardassian standards

67
00:02:26,685 --> 00:02:28,712
must be a little lower
than mine.

68
00:02:28,756 --> 00:02:29,781
Come on.

69
00:02:29,824 --> 00:02:31,794
Doctor, what do you
think you're doing?

70
00:02:31,828 --> 00:02:33,798
I'm taking you to the Infirmary.

71
00:02:33,832 --> 00:02:35,323
That won't be necessary.

72
00:02:35,402 --> 00:02:37,099
Well, maybe not,
but humor me.

73
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:39,667
Frankly, Doctor...

74
00:02:39,711 --> 00:02:42,011
I'm a little tired
of humoring you.

75
00:02:42,049 --> 00:02:44,281
Now, there's nothing
wrong with me

76
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,349
that a little peace
and privacy wouldn't cure.

77
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:48,985
Now, if you'll excuse me

78
00:02:49,029 --> 00:02:51,192
I seem to have lost my appetite.

79
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,810
What was that all about?

80
00:02:58,214 --> 00:03:01,050
I have no idea.

81
00:05:02,162 --> 00:05:04,132
Can you tell
what's wrong with it?

82
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:07,138
In my expert medical opinion

83
00:05:07,172 --> 00:05:09,438
I'd say it's... sick.

84
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:13,677
I know that, but why is it sick?

85
00:05:13,718 --> 00:05:15,881
I'm a doctor, not a botanist.

86
00:05:15,923 --> 00:05:18,223
Did you ask Professor O'Brien?

87
00:05:18,261 --> 00:05:20,960
Keiko's at a hydroponics
conference on Rigel IV.

88
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,594
She won't be back for a week.

89
00:05:22,636 --> 00:05:24,070
And none of your past hosts

90
00:05:24,106 --> 00:05:26,008
have had any experience
with plants?

91
00:05:26,043 --> 00:05:28,479
Daxes have never
been much on gardening.

92
00:05:28,514 --> 00:05:29,573
Tobin was the only one

93
00:05:29,616 --> 00:05:31,050
who ever tried
his hand at it

94
00:05:31,086 --> 00:05:32,885
but he had even less
luck with plants

95
00:05:32,924 --> 00:05:34,085
than he did with women.

96
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:36,255
Do you even know
where it's from?

97
00:05:36,297 --> 00:05:38,494
I picked it up on Ledonia III.

98
00:05:40,906 --> 00:05:42,374
May I?

99
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:44,345
Be my guest.

100
00:05:49,556 --> 00:05:51,492
Oh, that explains it.

101
00:05:51,527 --> 00:05:54,260
Ledonian soil contains
a benevolent mycorrhizal fungus

102
00:05:54,299 --> 00:05:56,531
that helps the native plants
retain water.

103
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:59,906
The fungus in this potting soil
has almost completely died out.

104
00:05:59,944 --> 00:06:01,675
But if we can salvage
what's left

105
00:06:01,714 --> 00:06:03,581
and cultivate a new batch
in the lab

106
00:06:03,617 --> 00:06:04,983
that should do the trick.

107
00:06:05,021 --> 00:06:06,489
Keiko would be proud of you.

108
00:06:06,557 --> 00:06:08,117
It's all there on the screen.

109
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,257
I only wish my humanoid patients
were as easy to treat.

110
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,101
Did Chief O'Brien
dislocate his shoulder again?

111
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:15,334
No, it's Garak.

112
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,843
Today at lunch,
he seemed as though

113
00:06:16,878 --> 00:06:18,711
he was going to have
some kind of seizure.

114
00:06:18,748 --> 00:06:20,046
He was having trouble breathing

115
00:06:20,084 --> 00:06:22,054
and he appeared to be
in a great deal of pain.

116
00:06:22,088 --> 00:06:24,058
But when I tried to get him
to come to the Infirmary

117
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,390
he outright refused.

118
00:06:25,428 --> 00:06:28,298
Maybe he just doesn't like
going to see the doctor.

119
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:29,860
Ah, that's not it.

120
00:06:29,904 --> 00:06:32,842
It's that damned Cardassian
evasiveness of his.

121
00:06:32,876 --> 00:06:35,541
I mean, keeping me guessing
about his past is one thing

122
00:06:35,581 --> 00:06:37,015
but when it comes
to his health...

123
00:06:37,052 --> 00:06:38,783
I don't know.

124
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:42,991
Why can't he just tell me
what's going on?

125
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,966
It sounds like you're
taking this personally.

126
00:06:45,001 --> 00:06:46,230
I suppose I am.

127
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,295
It's just that Garak and I

128
00:06:47,338 --> 00:06:48,898
have been having
lunch together once a week

129
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:49,932
for more than a year now.

130
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:51,445
You'd think he'd come
to trust me a little.

131
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,573
Why should he?

132
00:06:52,615 --> 00:06:54,710
It's not like the two of you
are really friends.

133
00:06:54,753 --> 00:06:57,589
Well, no, of course not.

134
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,288
I suppose
when it comes right down to it

135
00:06:59,329 --> 00:07:00,388
I don't trust him either.

136
00:07:00,431 --> 00:07:02,560
I mean, for all I know,
the man is a Cardassian spy.

137
00:07:02,602 --> 00:07:03,535
Exactly.

138
00:07:03,604 --> 00:07:05,540
Exactly.
And if he doesn't want my help

139
00:07:05,608 --> 00:07:07,168
that's his prerogative.

140
00:07:31,432 --> 00:07:33,334
So, I take it,
we understand each other.

141
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,672
Garak, how long have you
been living on this station?

142
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:38,007
Too long.

143
00:07:38,046 --> 00:07:41,018
And in all that time,
have I ever let you down?

144
00:07:41,052 --> 00:07:43,352
I have never done business
with you until now.

145
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:46,362
Which is why this deal
is so important to me.

146
00:07:46,396 --> 00:07:50,530
I want our business relationship
to get off on the right foot.

147
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,061
Now relax.

148
00:07:52,107 --> 00:07:53,770
You'll get your merchandise.

149
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:54,778
Soon, Quark.

150
00:07:54,812 --> 00:07:56,714
I can't wait much longer.

151
00:08:00,157 --> 00:08:03,288
You and Garak
going into business?

152
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:06,928
I couldn't help overhearing
your conversation.

153
00:08:06,969 --> 00:08:08,062
Oh, that.

154
00:08:08,106 --> 00:08:09,233
I'm helping Garak

155
00:08:09,275 --> 00:08:11,872
get a new sizing scanner
for his shop.

156
00:08:11,913 --> 00:08:13,610
A sizing scanner.

157
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,347
Not just any sizing scanner.

158
00:08:15,387 --> 00:08:17,516
The best,
straight from Merak II.

159
00:08:17,558 --> 00:08:20,689
Calibrated to be accurate
down to the micrometer

160
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:24,032
and I might add,
at a very reasonable price.

161
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:27,066
Really? I thought Garak
sounded a bit upset.

162
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,578
Upset? Garak?

163
00:08:28,613 --> 00:08:30,674
Oh, I hadn't noticed.

164
00:08:30,717 --> 00:08:34,623
Now, is there anything
I can do for you, hmm?

165
00:08:34,658 --> 00:08:37,459
A little Saurian brandy to go

166
00:08:37,498 --> 00:08:42,304
or maybe a late-night
session in a holosuite?

167
00:08:42,341 --> 00:08:43,935
No, thank you.

168
00:08:43,977 --> 00:08:47,211
I think I'll call it a night.

169
00:08:47,251 --> 00:08:48,880
Suit yourself.

170
00:08:57,604 --> 00:09:00,906
There, how does that feel?

171
00:09:00,944 --> 00:09:02,378
Much better.

172
00:09:02,414 --> 00:09:06,184
Well, try not to yell
at any more admirals for awhile.

173
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:07,450
I wasn't yelling.

174
00:09:07,491 --> 00:09:10,554
I was just expressing
my feelings, loudly.

175
00:09:10,597 --> 00:09:11,565
Chief.

176
00:09:11,599 --> 00:09:12,567
Commander.

177
00:09:12,601 --> 00:09:14,400
You wanted to see me?

178
00:09:14,438 --> 00:09:15,770
Ah, yes.

179
00:09:15,807 --> 00:09:17,367
I was hoping
you could give me a hand.

180
00:09:17,411 --> 00:09:19,574
I've been trying to access
the old Cardassian medical files

181
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,141
but I haven't been
having much luck.

182
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,175
I'm not surprised.

183
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,656
The Cardassians
did a general systems sweep

184
00:09:24,692 --> 00:09:26,024
before they pulled out.

185
00:09:26,061 --> 00:09:28,361
The medical files
would have been deleted

186
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,959
along with everything else.

187
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:32,565
Is there any way
to recover them?

188
00:09:32,608 --> 00:09:34,237
Maybe.

189
00:09:34,278 --> 00:09:37,148
These subroutines don't
look anywhere near as bad

190
00:09:37,184 --> 00:09:38,881
as the engineering files did.

191
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,254
I might be able
to reconstruct the data

192
00:09:41,292 --> 00:09:43,353
by micro-scanning
the purge trace.

193
00:09:43,396 --> 00:09:44,762
Well, how long will that take?

194
00:09:44,798 --> 00:09:47,395
Mmm. Two, maybe three weeks.

195
00:09:47,437 --> 00:09:51,571
Ah. Well, that settles that.

196
00:09:51,612 --> 00:09:53,411
Thank you anyway, Chief.

197
00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:55,146
I'm sorry I couldn't
be of any more help.

198
00:09:55,186 --> 00:09:56,951
Quark to Bashir.

199
00:09:56,989 --> 00:09:58,048
This is Bashir.

200
00:09:58,091 --> 00:10:00,961
Doctor, I need you
in my bar right away.

201
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,514
Oh, come on, Garak.

202
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,850
Don't you think
you've had enough?

203
00:10:12,888 --> 00:10:14,151
On the contrary.

204
00:10:14,191 --> 00:10:15,888
Anyone who talks about

205
00:10:15,927 --> 00:10:18,592
the numbing effects
of your liquor

206
00:10:18,633 --> 00:10:21,696
is severely overstating
the case, huh?

207
00:10:22,874 --> 00:10:24,274
What's all this?

208
00:10:24,311 --> 00:10:26,008
He came in complaining
about a headache.

209
00:10:26,047 --> 00:10:27,015
The next thing I knew

210
00:10:27,049 --> 00:10:28,609
he drank up
half my stock of <i>kanar.</i>

211
00:10:28,653 --> 00:10:34,096
Oh, Doctor,
what a pleasant surprise.

212
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,362
I apologize
for my outburst at lunch

213
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:38,769
but I promise
I'll make it up to you.

214
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:41,299
Please, join me.

215
00:10:43,483 --> 00:10:44,576
I think I will.

216
00:10:44,618 --> 00:10:45,608
May I?

217
00:10:45,653 --> 00:10:46,780
By all means.

218
00:10:46,822 --> 00:10:48,519
What are you doing?!

219
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:51,588
I think it's
a little noisy in here.

220
00:10:51,632 --> 00:10:54,695
Um, I'd prefer to drink
somewhere quiet.

221
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:57,676
Why, an excellent idea.

222
00:10:57,711 --> 00:11:00,581
We'll go to my quarters.

223
00:11:00,617 --> 00:11:02,246
Whatever you want.

224
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:06,455
But, first, I must make
a stop at the Infirmary.

225
00:11:06,495 --> 00:11:08,021
The Infirmary?

226
00:11:08,064 --> 00:11:10,500
Oh, my dear Doctor.

227
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:13,236
What kind of fool
do you take me for?

228
00:11:13,276 --> 00:11:15,405
Now, give me back my bottle.

229
00:11:16,515 --> 00:11:19,248
Give me my bottle back.

230
00:11:19,288 --> 00:11:20,654
I will...

231
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:21,783
in the Infirmary.

232
00:11:21,826 --> 00:11:24,092
I'm not going to the Infirmary

233
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,931
and I refuse to play
this ridiculous game.

234
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:28,768
Now, give me...

235
00:11:30,142 --> 00:11:32,078
Give...

236
00:11:35,453 --> 00:11:39,655
Make it stop, make it stop.

237
00:11:41,298 --> 00:11:42,927
Bashir to Ops.
Medical emergency.

238
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,767
Two to beam to the Infirmary.

239
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:46,273
Energize.

240
00:11:57,062 --> 00:11:58,121
Some kind of implant?

241
00:11:58,164 --> 00:11:59,189
Apparently.

242
00:11:59,234 --> 00:12:00,293
What's it for?

243
00:12:00,336 --> 00:12:02,033
Well, I was hoping
you could tell me.

244
00:12:02,072 --> 00:12:04,338
After working for
the Cardassians for five years

245
00:12:04,378 --> 00:12:06,405
I'd guess you'd know them
as well as anyone.

246
00:12:06,515 --> 00:12:07,881
Maybe so,
but I never bothered

247
00:12:07,918 --> 00:12:09,216
to look inside their skulls.

248
00:12:09,254 --> 00:12:10,586
No, I don't suppose you did.

249
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:13,093
Do you think this is the cause
of Garak's condition?

250
00:12:13,128 --> 00:12:14,153
It's possible.

251
00:12:14,196 --> 00:12:15,425
I mean, whatever this thing is

252
00:12:15,466 --> 00:12:17,265
it's situated
in his postcentral gyrus

253
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:18,864
and has filaments
that connect it

254
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,671
to his entire
central nervous system.

255
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,307
Maybe it's some kind
of punishment device...

256
00:12:23,349 --> 00:12:26,150
a parting gift from
the Cardassian government.

257
00:12:26,187 --> 00:12:27,246
I thought of that

258
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:28,690
but, based
on the amount of scarring

259
00:12:28,726 --> 00:12:29,716
in the surrounding tissue

260
00:12:29,761 --> 00:12:31,321
this implant's
been in there for years.

261
00:12:31,365 --> 00:12:33,460
And as far as I can tell,
Garak's only been in pain

262
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:34,470
for the past few days.

263
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,201
Interesting.

264
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,371
I wish I had an answer
for you, Doctor.

265
00:12:39,414 --> 00:12:42,181
Well, I was hoping
you could help me get one.

266
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,918
I think Quark knows
what this thing is.

267
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,587
Now, what makes you say that?

268
00:12:46,628 --> 00:12:48,598
I overheard them talking
the other night.

269
00:12:48,632 --> 00:12:51,468
Garak was negotiating to buy
some merchandise from Quark.

270
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:52,768
He seemed quite desperate.

271
00:12:52,807 --> 00:12:55,039
I tried to ask Quark
what it was about, but...

272
00:12:55,078 --> 00:12:56,911
No need to explain, Doctor.

273
00:12:56,949 --> 00:13:00,514
The direct approach seldom
works with people like him.

274
00:13:00,623 --> 00:13:03,823
But this could answer
some of my own questions.

275
00:13:03,863 --> 00:13:07,701
Quark has sent several coded
messages to Cardassia Prime

276
00:13:07,737 --> 00:13:09,171
in the past few days.

277
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:10,674
Really?

278
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,008
Mmm. I routinely monitor

279
00:13:12,046 --> 00:13:14,175
all of Quark's
subspace communications.

280
00:13:14,216 --> 00:13:16,482
Is that legal?

281
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:19,355
It's in the best interest
of station security.

282
00:13:19,394 --> 00:13:23,391
Doctor, do you want to know
what Quark knows or not?

283
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:25,338
I see your point.

284
00:13:25,373 --> 00:13:28,072
Then meet me in Security
at 0200 hours.

285
00:13:28,111 --> 00:13:30,947
Quark always makes
his clandestine calls

286
00:13:30,983 --> 00:13:32,509
after the bar closes.

287
00:13:32,554 --> 00:13:34,080
I wouldn't miss it.

288
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:46,036
Quark, you parasite.

289
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,016
It's been too long.

290
00:13:48,051 --> 00:13:51,546
Is Hartla still working for you?

291
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,756
The dabo tables wouldn't
be the same without her.

292
00:13:54,798 --> 00:13:57,827
Oh, what I wouldn't
give to see her again.

293
00:13:57,871 --> 00:13:59,500
I'm sure she misses you, too.

294
00:14:01,545 --> 00:14:03,276
I'll bet she does.

295
00:14:03,314 --> 00:14:04,646
Yeah.

296
00:14:04,684 --> 00:14:06,415
She would have bankrupted me

297
00:14:06,455 --> 00:14:09,393
if the occupation would
have lasted much longer.

298
00:14:09,427 --> 00:14:13,663
But I'm sure you didn't
contact me just to reminisce.

299
00:14:13,702 --> 00:14:15,501
What can I do for you?

300
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,808
How would you like to earn
a little extra latinum?

301
00:14:18,846 --> 00:14:21,316
Enough to buy yourself
a promotion?

302
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,843
You have my undivided attention.

303
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:26,690
I need a piece
of Cardassian biotechnology

304
00:14:26,728 --> 00:14:29,996
and the schematics relating
to its installation.

305
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,267
Hmm, biotechnology, huh?

306
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:35,574
Why, that shouldn't be
too difficult.

307
00:14:35,613 --> 00:14:36,808
What is it?

308
00:14:36,848 --> 00:14:40,948
You know, I never ask
those kinds of questions

309
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:44,589
but I've got
the requisition code number.

310
00:14:44,698 --> 00:14:46,030
Well, give it to me.

311
00:14:46,067 --> 00:14:47,194
I'll look for it.

312
00:14:47,236 --> 00:14:48,727
I knew I could count on you.
Here it is.

313
00:14:48,772 --> 00:14:51,573
I hope you don't have
one of these little bugs

314
00:14:51,612 --> 00:14:52,944
hidden in my quarters.

315
00:14:52,981 --> 00:14:54,279
Should I?

316
00:14:54,316 --> 00:14:55,614
Transmission complete.

317
00:14:55,653 --> 00:14:56,780
Hold on.

318
00:14:56,822 --> 00:14:59,521
This won't take long.

319
00:14:59,561 --> 00:15:02,431
Take your time.

320
00:15:07,543 --> 00:15:09,672
Quark, you idiot!

321
00:15:09,714 --> 00:15:11,046
Is something wrong?

322
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,746
Is something wrong?!

323
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,153
I'm ruined!

324
00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:15,487
My career is over!

325
00:15:15,526 --> 00:15:17,462
What did I do?!

326
00:15:17,497 --> 00:15:19,592
You and your damned
requisition code.

327
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,604
It's for classified
biotechnology, Quark.

328
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:23,471
Even the cursed number
is classified.

329
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:24,772
Where did you get it?!

330
00:15:24,811 --> 00:15:26,974
No, don't tell me!

331
00:15:27,015 --> 00:15:30,546
I don't want to know.

332
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:33,025
If I'm lucky,
I can still get through this

333
00:15:33,061 --> 00:15:34,552
with my skin intact.

334
00:15:34,597 --> 00:15:37,626
Maybe they won't trace
the request back to me.

335
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:38,831
Who won't?

336
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,573
The Obsidian Order.

337
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:46,143
Nice talking to you, Boheeka.

338
00:15:46,187 --> 00:15:47,879
We'll have to do it
again sometime.

339
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:49,906
We'll have to do it
again sometime.

340
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:52,887
The Obsidian Order.

341
00:15:52,922 --> 00:15:54,858
That certainly
complicates things.

342
00:15:54,893 --> 00:15:56,327
Who are they?

343
00:15:56,362 --> 00:15:58,332
They're the ever-vigilant
eyes and ears

344
00:15:58,366 --> 00:15:59,995
of the Cardassian Empire.

345
00:16:00,036 --> 00:16:02,336
It is said
that a Cardassian citizen

346
00:16:02,374 --> 00:16:05,175
cannot sit down to a meal
without each dish

347
00:16:05,213 --> 00:16:08,014
being duly noted
and recorded by the Order.

348
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:10,022
What happens
if you eat something

349
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:12,026
that doesn't meet
with their approval?

350
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,123
People have been known
to disappear for less.

351
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:18,002
Whether you agree
with their goals or not

352
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:21,843
you can't help but admire
their efficiency.

353
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,547
Even the Romulan Tal Shiar
can't compete with them

354
00:16:25,588 --> 00:16:27,387
when it comes
to intelligence gathering

355
00:16:27,492 --> 00:16:28,619
and covert operations.

356
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,721
What has all this
to do with Garak?

357
00:16:30,765 --> 00:16:32,233
I wish I knew.

358
00:16:32,267 --> 00:16:34,237
Do you think the Order

359
00:16:34,271 --> 00:16:36,537
put that implant
inside Garak's head?

360
00:16:36,576 --> 00:16:38,273
I have a better question.

361
00:16:38,312 --> 00:16:40,782
If the implant
is a punishment device

362
00:16:40,818 --> 00:16:44,815
then why is Garak trying
to get his hands on another one?

363
00:16:44,859 --> 00:16:46,954
He did asked for specifications.

364
00:16:46,997 --> 00:16:50,231
Maybe he's trying to find
some way of removing it.

365
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,670
Well, either way,
I'd like to have

366
00:16:51,706 --> 00:16:53,106
a talk with him
when he wakes up.

367
00:16:53,142 --> 00:16:54,839
You'll have to get in line.

368
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:56,245
Thank you

369
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:57,545
Constable.

370
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,221
Computer, report on the status
of patient Garak.

371
00:17:05,266 --> 00:17:08,397
Patient Garak is no longer
in the Infirmary.

372
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:09,737
What?

373
00:17:09,776 --> 00:17:11,108
When did he leave?

374
00:17:11,145 --> 00:17:15,176
Patient checked out
at 0320 hours.

375
00:17:33,724 --> 00:17:37,459
Garak, are you in there?

376
00:17:37,565 --> 00:17:39,056
Computer, open the door

377
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:41,298
to Chamber 901,
Habitat Level H-3.

378
00:17:41,338 --> 00:17:44,174
Emergency medical override,
Bashir 1-Alpha.

379
00:17:46,515 --> 00:17:48,951
Ah, Doctor,
what a pleasant surprise.

380
00:17:48,987 --> 00:17:52,016
I'm sorry, I must have
missed the door chime.

381
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,859
What the hell do you
think you're doing?!

382
00:17:53,897 --> 00:17:55,024
Triptacederin?

383
00:17:55,066 --> 00:17:56,626
How much of this did you take?

384
00:17:56,670 --> 00:18:00,131
A mere 30cc's...
not nearly enough, I'm afraid.

385
00:18:00,176 --> 00:18:02,875
30cc's would anesthetize
an Algorian mammoth.

386
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,819
Oh, we Cardassians must
be made of sterner stuff.

387
00:18:05,854 --> 00:18:06,947
I barely feel it.

388
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,083
Listen to me, Garak.

389
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,027
I've had just about enough
of your nonsense.

390
00:18:10,063 --> 00:18:12,192
Now you're coming back
to the Infirmary with me.

391
00:18:12,234 --> 00:18:13,702
Oh, I don't think so.

392
00:18:13,737 --> 00:18:15,570
Believe me when I tell you

393
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:17,976
there's nothing
you can do for me.

394
00:18:18,012 --> 00:18:19,446
Oh, and Quark can, is that it?

395
00:18:19,481 --> 00:18:22,612
I thought I was
supposed to be the spy.

396
00:18:22,655 --> 00:18:24,215
Quark's not coming, Garak.

397
00:18:24,258 --> 00:18:25,487
How do you know?

398
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,055
I heard him talking
to his Cardassian contact.

399
00:18:29,101 --> 00:18:31,071
He couldn't get
the item you requested.

400
00:18:31,105 --> 00:18:32,073
Really?

401
00:18:32,107 --> 00:18:35,341
That's most distressing

402
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:40,687
but I suppose
not all that surprising.

403
00:18:40,724 --> 00:18:45,393
Ah, well,
maybe it's for the best.

404
00:18:45,433 --> 00:18:49,305
My hypospray, if you please.

405
00:18:49,341 --> 00:18:51,869
Another dose of triptacederin
might kill you.

406
00:18:51,913 --> 00:18:53,439
Thank you for your concern,
Doctor

407
00:18:53,482 --> 00:18:55,418
but I'd rather
have the hypospray.

408
00:18:55,453 --> 00:18:57,548
I'm not going to let you
commit suicide.

409
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,683
I'm here to help you.

410
00:18:58,727 --> 00:19:00,697
I doubt you can!

411
00:19:04,604 --> 00:19:07,667
I think you'll find
that I'm experiencing

412
00:19:07,712 --> 00:19:11,982
some slight deterioration
of my cranial nerve cluster.

413
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,283
It's not so slight, I'm afraid.

414
00:19:13,322 --> 00:19:15,953
We've got to get you
to the Infirmary.

415
00:19:15,994 --> 00:19:17,520
My dear Doctor

416
00:19:17,564 --> 00:19:20,263
I have no intention
of putting myself on display

417
00:19:20,303 --> 00:19:23,742
for the amusement of the Bajoran
inhabitants of this station.

418
00:19:23,777 --> 00:19:25,872
It's not your pride
I'm worried about.

419
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:26,882
It's that implant

420
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,182
you're carrying around
inside your head.

421
00:19:29,221 --> 00:19:30,712
You know about that, do you?

422
00:19:30,758 --> 00:19:32,557
It's some sort of punishment
device, isn't it?

423
00:19:32,594 --> 00:19:35,225
Punishment device?

424
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:41,868
Well, I suppose, in a way,
that's what it's become.

425
00:19:41,913 --> 00:19:43,576
If it wasn't put there
to punish you

426
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:44,777
then what's it for?

427
00:19:47,123 --> 00:19:49,788
Garak! I need to know
what we're up against.

428
00:19:49,829 --> 00:19:52,129
If you tell me what it's for

429
00:19:52,167 --> 00:19:53,966
maybe I could find
some way to remove it.

430
00:19:54,004 --> 00:19:55,735
It's hopeless, Doctor.

431
00:19:55,774 --> 00:19:57,869
Believe me, it can't be removed.

432
00:19:57,912 --> 00:19:58,902
How do you know?

433
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,279
That's the whole point.

434
00:20:00,316 --> 00:20:04,620
If it could be easily removed,
it would be useless.

435
00:20:04,691 --> 00:20:08,152
You see, on Cardassia

436
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:10,830
I was entrusted
with certain information...

437
00:20:10,871 --> 00:20:13,502
information that needed
to be kept safe

438
00:20:13,542 --> 00:20:15,444
regardless of the situation.

439
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,577
My implant was given to me
by Enabran Tain himself...

440
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:20,748
the head of the Obsidian Order.

441
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,317
If I was ever tortured

442
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,596
it was designed to stimulate
the pleasure centers of my brain

443
00:20:26,635 --> 00:20:28,366
to trigger the production

444
00:20:28,405 --> 00:20:31,002
of vast amounts
of natural endorphins.

445
00:20:31,044 --> 00:20:33,880
I do hope you appreciate
the irony, Doctor.

446
00:20:33,917 --> 00:20:38,358
The whole purpose of the implant
was to make me immune to pain.

447
00:20:38,392 --> 00:20:40,157
What caused it to malfunction?

448
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:45,934
It was never meant
for continuous use.

449
00:20:45,974 --> 00:20:47,374
Continuous use.

450
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,004
What do you mean?

451
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:55,892
Living on this station
is torture for me, Doctor.

452
00:20:55,928 --> 00:20:59,298
The temperature
is always too cold.

453
00:20:59,334 --> 00:21:01,736
The lights always too bright.

454
00:21:01,773 --> 00:21:04,301
Every Bajoran on the station

455
00:21:04,344 --> 00:21:07,805
looks at me
with loathing and contempt.

456
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:14,092
So, one day, I decided
I couldn't live with it anymore

457
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:17,193
and I took the pain away.

458
00:21:17,236 --> 00:21:19,502
You activated the implant.

459
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:22,172
I created a device
which allowed me

460
00:21:22,213 --> 00:21:25,310
to trigger the implant
whenever I wanted it.

461
00:21:25,353 --> 00:21:28,723
At first, I only used it
a few minutes a day

462
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:32,129
but then I began relying
on it more and more

463
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:36,402
until, finally, I just turned
it on and never shut it off.

464
00:21:36,441 --> 00:21:38,070
How long has it been on?

465
00:21:38,112 --> 00:21:39,741
Two years.

466
00:21:39,781 --> 00:21:41,751
And now the implant
is breaking down.

467
00:21:41,819 --> 00:21:43,310
That's correct.

468
00:21:43,355 --> 00:21:45,382
So, why don't you just shut
the damn thing off?

469
00:21:45,426 --> 00:21:46,689
It's too late now.

470
00:21:46,728 --> 00:21:49,291
My body has become
completely dependent

471
00:21:49,334 --> 00:21:53,138
on the higher endorphin levels
generated by the implant.

472
00:21:54,477 --> 00:21:56,071
So, that's it then.

473
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:58,831
You're just going to give up
and let them win.

474
00:21:58,964 --> 00:22:00,364
"Them," Doctor?

475
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,270
The Central Command,
the Obsidian Order...

476
00:22:03,306 --> 00:22:04,706
whoever it is
who exiled you here.

477
00:22:04,742 --> 00:22:05,937
You're just going
to roll over and die

478
00:22:05,978 --> 00:22:07,037
let them destroy you

479
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,175
give up any hope of ever
seeing Cardassia again.

480
00:22:09,285 --> 00:22:10,914
Doctor, did anyone ever tell you

481
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:12,652
that you are
an infuriating pest?

482
00:22:12,691 --> 00:22:13,852
Chief O'Brien, all the time

483
00:22:13,894 --> 00:22:15,921
and I don't pay any attention
to him, either.

484
00:22:15,965 --> 00:22:17,433
Has it ever occurred to you

485
00:22:17,467 --> 00:22:20,166
that I might be getting
exactly what I deserve?

486
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:21,697
No one deserves this.

487
00:22:21,742 --> 00:22:24,373
Oh, please, Doctor,
I'm suffering enough

488
00:22:24,415 --> 00:22:26,044
without having to listen

489
00:22:26,085 --> 00:22:28,214
to your smug
Federation sympathy.

490
00:22:28,323 --> 00:22:30,920
Do you think that,
because we have lunch together

491
00:22:30,962 --> 00:22:32,932
once a week, you know me?

492
00:22:32,966 --> 00:22:37,464
You couldn't even begin
to fathom what I'm capable of.

493
00:22:37,507 --> 00:22:38,873
I'm a doctor.

494
00:22:38,911 --> 00:22:40,676
You're my patient.

495
00:22:40,714 --> 00:22:43,242
That's all I need to know.

496
00:22:43,353 --> 00:22:44,787
Wrong again.

497
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:49,024
You need to know
who you're trying to save.

498
00:22:51,135 --> 00:22:53,230
During the occupation

499
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:57,144
I was a Gul in the Cardassian
mechanized infantry.

500
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:00,175
We were stationed just
outside the Bajoran capital.

501
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,985
Shortly before the withdrawal

502
00:23:02,024 --> 00:23:05,428
a handful of Bajoran prisoners
escaped from my custody.

503
00:23:05,463 --> 00:23:07,490
My aide, a man named Elim

504
00:23:07,534 --> 00:23:09,163
tracked them
to a Cardassian shuttle

505
00:23:09,204 --> 00:23:11,333
about to depart for Terok Nor.

506
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:12,741
Elim got aboard

507
00:23:12,778 --> 00:23:15,112
but the Captain refused
to let him search the ship

508
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:18,122
because he claimed he was under
strict orders from Gul Dukat

509
00:23:18,156 --> 00:23:19,819
to depart immediately.

510
00:23:19,858 --> 00:23:22,989
So, I had the shuttle destroyed

511
00:23:23,032 --> 00:23:29,638
killing the escapees, Elim
and 97 Cardassian civilians.

512
00:23:29,678 --> 00:23:32,582
You can't be serious.

513
00:23:32,617 --> 00:23:34,678
I followed my orders.

514
00:23:34,721 --> 00:23:39,789
None of those prisoners
escaped off of Bajor alive.

515
00:23:39,832 --> 00:23:42,736
Unfortunately,
as it turned out

516
00:23:42,771 --> 00:23:45,436
one of the passengers
on the shuttle was the daughter

517
00:23:45,477 --> 00:23:47,106
of a prominent
military official.

518
00:23:47,147 --> 00:23:50,085
I was stripped of my rank
and commission

519
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:55,222
and exiled from Cardassia.

520
00:23:55,263 --> 00:23:58,667
So, now you know, Doctor.

521
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:05,205
I hope... I haven't shattered
too many of your illusions.

522
00:24:07,521 --> 00:24:10,516
Listen to me, Garak.

523
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:14,091
Right now, I'm not concerned
with what you did in the past.

524
00:24:14,134 --> 00:24:17,573
I'm simply not going to walk
out of here and let you die.

525
00:24:17,607 --> 00:24:19,804
We need to turn
that implant off

526
00:24:19,845 --> 00:24:22,145
and whatever withdrawal symptoms

527
00:24:22,184 --> 00:24:24,313
or side effects
you may experience

528
00:24:24,354 --> 00:24:28,454
I promise I'll help
you through them.

529
00:24:28,496 --> 00:24:32,698
I need to know where
that triggering device is.

530
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:35,071
Where is it?

531
00:24:36,912 --> 00:24:39,748
The desk, second drawer.

532
00:24:58,656 --> 00:25:00,353
Well, that will be all for now.

533
00:25:00,393 --> 00:25:02,386
If you need to reach me,
I'll be here

534
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,161
for at least the next 26 hours.

535
00:25:04,201 --> 00:25:06,000
Computer, I'm reading
an ongoing erosion

536
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:08,805
of tissue in the patient's
lymphatic system. Explain.

537
00:25:08,843 --> 00:25:11,815
Unable to determine a cause
due to insufficient data

538
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:14,319
on Cardassian physiology.

539
00:25:14,354 --> 00:25:15,549
All right.

540
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,819
Continue to monitor the status

541
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:18,225
of the patient's
cranial implant.

542
00:25:18,262 --> 00:25:20,232
Inform me if it shows
any sign of reactivation.

543
00:25:21,702 --> 00:25:22,863
Yes?

544
00:25:22,904 --> 00:25:24,703
Doctor.

545
00:25:24,741 --> 00:25:27,736
I was hoping I could ask Garak
some questions.

546
00:25:27,781 --> 00:25:29,147
He's asleep.

547
00:25:29,184 --> 00:25:31,381
He has been ever since
I turned off his implant.

548
00:25:31,422 --> 00:25:35,055
Now, come on,
we can talk outside.

549
00:25:35,096 --> 00:25:36,827
Doctor, I need to talk to him
as soon as possible.

550
00:25:36,865 --> 00:25:39,393
I have four cases left
in my homicide files

551
00:25:39,438 --> 00:25:41,738
which I'm almost certain
were committed

552
00:25:41,775 --> 00:25:43,073
by the Obsidian Order.

553
00:25:43,112 --> 00:25:44,375
If Garak was a member

554
00:25:44,414 --> 00:25:46,907
he may be able
to shed some light on them.

555
00:25:46,952 --> 00:25:49,047
I'm afraid your questions
will have to wait.

556
00:25:49,091 --> 00:25:50,754
How long?

557
00:25:50,793 --> 00:25:51,988
I don't know yet.

558
00:25:52,029 --> 00:25:55,160
Constable, Garak's body
has undergone a severe shock.

559
00:25:55,203 --> 00:25:57,070
I don't know
when he'll recover.

560
00:25:57,107 --> 00:25:59,806
I'm not even sure
if he'll recover.

561
00:25:59,845 --> 00:26:02,213
In that case,
I want to talk to him now.

562
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,218
Wake him up.

563
00:26:03,252 --> 00:26:04,379
I'll do no such thing.

564
00:26:04,488 --> 00:26:08,826
Doctor, these are murder cases,
and Garak may be a suspect.

565
00:26:08,863 --> 00:26:11,356
That may be so,
but he's still my patient

566
00:26:11,402 --> 00:26:13,338
and I'll not have him disturbed.

567
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:15,969
So, until further notice,
his quarters are off limits

568
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:18,139
to everyone except emergency
medical personnel.

569
00:26:18,182 --> 00:26:21,450
So, if you'll excuse me,
I have a patient to attend to.

570
00:27:57,213 --> 00:27:57,894
Garak?

571
00:27:58,026 --> 00:27:59,016
Leave me alone.

572
00:27:59,128 --> 00:28:00,791
I don't think that would be
a good idea right now.

573
00:28:00,832 --> 00:28:02,859
Your blood chemistry
is severely imbalanced.

574
00:28:02,903 --> 00:28:04,098
You need to rest.

575
00:28:04,138 --> 00:28:05,606
Don't touch me.

576
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:06,940
Just calm down.

577
00:28:06,978 --> 00:28:09,950
I don't want to calm down,
Doctor.

578
00:28:09,984 --> 00:28:12,386
I've been calm long enough.

579
00:28:12,422 --> 00:28:14,119
Look at this place.

580
00:28:14,158 --> 00:28:15,626
It's pathetic.

581
00:28:15,662 --> 00:28:19,466
To think that this is what
my life has been reduced to.

582
00:28:19,503 --> 00:28:23,443
This sterile shell,
this... prison.

583
00:28:23,478 --> 00:28:24,707
Take it easy, Garak.

584
00:28:24,747 --> 00:28:27,013
Look, you're obviously
experiencing some side effects

585
00:28:27,051 --> 00:28:29,317
from the deactivation
of the implant.

586
00:28:29,356 --> 00:28:30,483
Ridiculous.

587
00:28:30,525 --> 00:28:32,016
I feel more clearheaded

588
00:28:32,061 --> 00:28:34,293
than I have
in the past two years.

589
00:28:35,402 --> 00:28:40,470
Two years... what a waste
these past two years have been.

590
00:28:41,547 --> 00:28:43,380
There was a time, Doctor.

591
00:28:43,418 --> 00:28:46,447
Oh! There was a time
when I was a power.

592
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:49,394
The protégé
of Enabran Tain himself.

593
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:52,300
Do you have any idea
what that means?

594
00:28:52,335 --> 00:28:53,735
I'm afraid I don't.

595
00:28:53,771 --> 00:28:55,171
No, you don't, do you?

596
00:28:55,207 --> 00:28:57,234
You don't know much of anything.

597
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,044
Tain was the Obsidian Order.

598
00:28:59,082 --> 00:29:02,179
Not even the Central Command
dared challenge him

599
00:29:02,221 --> 00:29:04,157
and I was his right hand.

600
00:29:04,192 --> 00:29:05,718
My future was limitless

601
00:29:05,762 --> 00:29:08,666
until I threw it away.

602
00:29:08,701 --> 00:29:10,637
You mean when you had
that shuttle shot down

603
00:29:10,672 --> 00:29:12,335
to stop those prisoners
from escaping?

604
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,434
Stopped them.

605
00:29:13,478 --> 00:29:15,038
I only wish
that I had stopped them.

606
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,343
You didn't?

607
00:29:16,383 --> 00:29:19,287
No, Doctor, my disgrace
is worse than that.

608
00:29:19,323 --> 00:29:20,621
Unimaginably worse.

609
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:24,028
What could you have
possibly done worse than that?

610
00:29:24,065 --> 00:29:26,535
I let them go.

611
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:30,203
It was the eve
of the Cardassian withdrawal.

612
00:29:30,244 --> 00:29:33,614
Elim and I were
interrogating five Bajorans.

613
00:29:33,651 --> 00:29:35,553
They were children, Doctor!

614
00:29:35,588 --> 00:29:38,185
None of them were older
than 14 years old.

615
00:29:38,226 --> 00:29:39,387
They knew nothing.

616
00:29:39,429 --> 00:29:41,331
They lived in bombed-out rooms

617
00:29:41,367 --> 00:29:43,496
scrounged for food
on the streets.

618
00:29:43,538 --> 00:29:45,531
They were filthy and they stank.

619
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:50,313
The room was freezing cold,
the air was like ice

620
00:29:50,351 --> 00:29:54,223
and suddenly the whole exercise
seemed utterly meaningless.

621
00:29:54,258 --> 00:29:58,665
All I wanted was a hot bath
and a good meal.

622
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:05,102
And so I let them go.

623
00:30:05,147 --> 00:30:07,617
I gave them whatever latinum
I had in my pockets

624
00:30:07,652 --> 00:30:08,642
and opened the door

625
00:30:08,688 --> 00:30:11,524
and flung them back
into the streets.

626
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,723
Elim couldn't believe his eyes.

627
00:30:13,764 --> 00:30:17,499
He looked at me
as if I were insane.

628
00:30:17,539 --> 00:30:19,338
You took pity on those children.

629
00:30:19,376 --> 00:30:21,403
There's nothing wrong with that.

630
00:30:21,447 --> 00:30:22,608
No! I was a fool!

631
00:30:22,649 --> 00:30:25,177
I should have completed
my interrogation

632
00:30:25,254 --> 00:30:28,420
and turned them over
to the troops for execution

633
00:30:28,461 --> 00:30:31,831
but because I was chilly
and my stomach was growling

634
00:30:31,867 --> 00:30:33,096
I failed in my duty

635
00:30:33,136 --> 00:30:35,835
and destroyed everything
I had worked for.

636
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,038
And so they exiled you.

637
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:39,708
That's right.

638
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:45,661
And left me to live out my days
with nothing to look forward to

639
00:30:45,695 --> 00:30:48,063
but having lunch with you.

640
00:30:48,099 --> 00:30:50,228
Well, I'm sorry
you feel that way.

641
00:30:50,304 --> 00:30:52,832
I thought
you enjoyed my company.

642
00:30:52,876 --> 00:30:55,643
Oh, I did,
and that's the worst part.

643
00:30:55,682 --> 00:30:58,711
I can't believe
that I actually enjoyed

644
00:30:58,754 --> 00:31:00,348
eating mediocre food

645
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:04,092
and staring into your
smug, sanctimonious face.

646
00:31:04,131 --> 00:31:09,164
I hate this place,
and I hate you.

647
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:11,805
Okay, Garak,
that's your prerogative.

648
00:31:11,847 --> 00:31:15,183
Now, I really think
you should lie down.

649
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,019
Get away from me!

650
00:31:17,057 --> 00:31:18,389
Garak...

651
00:31:25,073 --> 00:31:26,336
Garak, stop this.

652
00:31:26,376 --> 00:31:28,573
I don't want to hurt you.

653
00:31:33,089 --> 00:31:35,059
Bashir to Infirmary.

654
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:38,588
I need an emergency medical team
in Garak's quarters now.

655
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:45,612
Administer another
20cc's of hyperzine.

656
00:31:47,284 --> 00:31:48,252
He's not responding.

657
00:31:48,286 --> 00:31:49,276
Give it a second.

658
00:31:49,321 --> 00:31:51,723
Begin cardio-stimulation.

659
00:31:52,896 --> 00:31:54,194
His heartbeat is stabilizing.

660
00:31:54,231 --> 00:31:56,224
But his lymphatic system
is still critical.

661
00:31:56,269 --> 00:31:57,328
I don't understand it.

662
00:31:59,141 --> 00:32:00,109
I shut down the implant.

663
00:32:00,143 --> 00:32:01,874
It can't be affecting
his blood chemistry.

664
00:32:01,914 --> 00:32:03,816
Yet toxins are
still accumulating

665
00:32:03,851 --> 00:32:05,980
in his lymphatic tissues.

666
00:32:06,022 --> 00:32:09,358
Computer, display analysis
of all biochemical samples

667
00:32:09,395 --> 00:32:12,162
taken from the patient
in the past 39 hours.

668
00:32:12,201 --> 00:32:15,766
Display them
by chemical composition.

669
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:20,648
Isolate and display
sample number... 17.

670
00:32:23,223 --> 00:32:25,922
Bring up sample 23.

671
00:32:25,962 --> 00:32:28,194
Sample 27.

672
00:32:29,669 --> 00:32:31,332
Sample 32.

673
00:32:32,675 --> 00:32:34,838
Sample 35.

674
00:32:35,848 --> 00:32:37,214
Sample 40.

675
00:32:37,251 --> 00:32:38,811
Stop.

676
00:32:38,854 --> 00:32:41,553
Bring back sample 35.

677
00:32:43,296 --> 00:32:45,927
Superimpose the molecular
structure of this leukocyte

678
00:32:45,968 --> 00:32:48,234
with an analogous sample
taken from yesterday.

679
00:32:51,513 --> 00:32:52,879
That's it.

680
00:32:52,916 --> 00:32:54,852
The molecular structure
of Garak's leukocytes

681
00:32:54,886 --> 00:32:55,854
has been altered.

682
00:32:55,888 --> 00:32:57,015
That must be what's causing

683
00:32:57,057 --> 00:32:58,754
the accumulation
of toxins in his system.

684
00:32:58,794 --> 00:33:00,559
Can we synthesize
Cardassian leukocytes?

685
00:33:00,598 --> 00:33:02,124
Probably, but that
could take weeks

686
00:33:02,167 --> 00:33:03,635
and we don't have
that much time.

687
00:33:03,671 --> 00:33:05,231
We have three
or four days at most.

688
00:33:05,273 --> 00:33:06,639
If we turned
the implant back on

689
00:33:06,677 --> 00:33:08,077
we might be able
to keep him alive

690
00:33:08,112 --> 00:33:09,080
another week or two.

691
00:33:09,114 --> 00:33:10,082
No.

692
00:33:10,116 --> 00:33:11,106
What?

693
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,455
I won't allow it.

694
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:19,161
I never want that thing
turned on again.

695
00:33:19,201 --> 00:33:20,830
I understand how you feel

696
00:33:20,871 --> 00:33:23,775
but I'm not sure what
else I can do for you.

697
00:33:23,811 --> 00:33:28,651
Oh, you've done enough, Doctor,
more than I deserve.

698
00:33:28,687 --> 00:33:31,921
There's something
you have to know.

699
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,362
What's that?

700
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:36,459
The truth.

701
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:43,380
I've about given up on learning
the truth from you, Garak.

702
00:33:43,416 --> 00:33:46,752
Oh, don't give up
on me now, Doctor.

703
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:49,192
Patience has its rewards.

704
00:33:49,228 --> 00:33:51,825
Now listen carefully.

705
00:33:51,867 --> 00:33:54,303
Elim wasn't my aide.

706
00:33:54,338 --> 00:33:58,642
He was... my friend.

707
00:33:58,681 --> 00:34:00,241
We grew up together.

708
00:34:00,283 --> 00:34:02,583
We were closer than brothers.

709
00:34:02,622 --> 00:34:06,460
For some reason Enabran Tain
took a liking to us.

710
00:34:06,495 --> 00:34:08,488
Before long, we were both

711
00:34:08,533 --> 00:34:11,664
very powerful men
in the Obsidian Order.

712
00:34:11,707 --> 00:34:14,372
They called us
"the sons of Tain."

713
00:34:14,411 --> 00:34:17,474
Even the Guls feared us.

714
00:34:17,517 --> 00:34:19,680
And then there was a scandal.

715
00:34:19,723 --> 00:34:22,159
Someone in the Order was accused

716
00:34:22,194 --> 00:34:25,223
of letting some Bajoran
prisoners escape.

717
00:34:25,266 --> 00:34:29,867
There were constant rumors of
who was going to be implicated.

718
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:32,608
Fingers were being pointed
at me.

719
00:34:32,648 --> 00:34:36,816
By then, Tain had retired
to the Arawath Colony.

720
00:34:36,857 --> 00:34:41,390
He couldn't protect me,
so I panicked.

721
00:34:41,432 --> 00:34:43,995
I did everything in my power

722
00:34:44,037 --> 00:34:48,535
to make sure that Elim
was accused instead of me.

723
00:34:48,579 --> 00:34:51,631
I altered records,
planted evidence

724
00:34:51,765 --> 00:34:55,500
only to discover
that he'd beaten me to it.

725
00:34:55,539 --> 00:34:58,636
Well, he betrayed you first.

726
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,740
Elim destroyed me.

727
00:35:00,783 --> 00:35:07,525
Before I knew what was going on,
I was sentenced to exile.

728
00:35:09,033 --> 00:35:12,335
And the irony is, I deserved it.

729
00:35:12,372 --> 00:35:16,107
Oh, not for the reasons
they claimed

730
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:22,684
but because of what I had tried
to do to Elim, my best friend.

731
00:35:22,727 --> 00:35:26,029
Why are you telling me this,
Garak?

732
00:35:26,067 --> 00:35:30,030
So that you can forgive me.

733
00:35:30,075 --> 00:35:31,373
Why else?

734
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:37,787
I need to know
that someone forgives me.

735
00:35:44,103 --> 00:35:46,904
I forgive you...

736
00:35:46,942 --> 00:35:49,778
for whatever it is you did.

737
00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:52,513
Thank you, Doctor.

738
00:35:52,553 --> 00:35:55,218
That's most kind.

739
00:36:03,074 --> 00:36:04,737
See that he rests comfortably.

740
00:36:04,845 --> 00:36:06,542
I'll be back within 52 hours.

741
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,380
Where are you going?

742
00:36:08,418 --> 00:36:11,754
To find the man
responsible for this.

743
00:36:58,117 --> 00:36:59,746
Dr. Bashir.

744
00:36:59,788 --> 00:37:01,587
Welcome.

745
00:37:01,624 --> 00:37:03,685
Please, make yourself at home.

746
00:37:10,342 --> 00:37:12,939
Well, Doctor, you've come
all this way to see me.

747
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:14,917
Aren't you going
to say something?

748
00:37:14,951 --> 00:37:16,682
How did you know my name?

749
00:37:16,721 --> 00:37:19,454
Information's my business.

750
00:37:19,493 --> 00:37:21,963
You're Enabran Tain.

751
00:37:21,999 --> 00:37:24,367
And you're
Dr. Julian Subatoi Bashir.

752
00:37:24,403 --> 00:37:26,805
I hope you weren't
greeted too rudely

753
00:37:26,842 --> 00:37:28,835
upon entering Cardassian space.

754
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:31,544
Not nearly as rudely
as I expected.

755
00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:34,579
Good, I alerted them
that you'd be coming.

756
00:37:34,623 --> 00:37:36,718
The military hates surprises.

757
00:37:36,762 --> 00:37:39,198
Still, what you did
was very brave.

758
00:37:39,233 --> 00:37:40,428
I'm impressed.

759
00:37:40,468 --> 00:37:43,338
Can I get you
something to drink?

760
00:37:43,374 --> 00:37:44,842
Tarkalean tea, perhaps?

761
00:37:44,878 --> 00:37:48,409
I always drink Tarkalean... tea.

762
00:37:48,451 --> 00:37:51,446
A good host knows
the needs of his guests.

763
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:55,191
One Tarkalean tea, extra sweet.

764
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,292
And a glass of <i>kanar.</i>

765
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:05,408
So, Lieutenant, how's Garak?

766
00:38:05,452 --> 00:38:08,015
Has his condition
improved at all?

767
00:38:09,026 --> 00:38:12,055
That Cardassian Quark
was talking to, Boheeka

768
00:38:12,099 --> 00:38:14,001
I suppose he really did have

769
00:38:14,036 --> 00:38:16,472
a reason to fear
the Obsidian Order.

770
00:38:16,507 --> 00:38:19,604
Everyone has reason
to fear the Order.

771
00:38:19,646 --> 00:38:20,705
I don't understand it.

772
00:38:20,748 --> 00:38:22,274
Garak told me you were retired.

773
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:23,514
Oh, I am.

774
00:38:23,554 --> 00:38:24,783
Have been for years.

775
00:38:24,824 --> 00:38:27,557
But I try to keep informed
on current events.

776
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:29,030
I bet you could tell me

777
00:38:29,066 --> 00:38:31,833
all kinds of things
I'd like to know, Doctor.

778
00:38:31,872 --> 00:38:32,999
Oh, I'm sure I could.

779
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,671
I'll tell you anything
you want to know

780
00:38:35,712 --> 00:38:38,080
about medicine,
biology, or tennis.

781
00:38:38,117 --> 00:38:40,178
Do you want to hear my opinion

782
00:38:40,221 --> 00:38:42,714
on the latest nillimite
alloy racket?

783
00:38:42,759 --> 00:38:44,888
I don't think
that would be necessary.

784
00:38:44,931 --> 00:38:46,229
Have it your way.

785
00:38:46,267 --> 00:38:48,737
Are all the Starfleet
Lieutenants

786
00:38:48,771 --> 00:38:50,331
as brash as you are?

787
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:52,140
I couldn't say.

788
00:38:52,179 --> 00:38:54,342
Though I doubt it.

789
00:38:54,383 --> 00:38:55,476
So do I.

790
00:38:55,518 --> 00:39:00,426
Tell me, Doctor,
how sick is Garak?

791
00:39:00,461 --> 00:39:02,363
He's dying.

792
00:39:02,399 --> 00:39:04,096
And you're trying to save him.

793
00:39:04,136 --> 00:39:05,161
That's right.

794
00:39:05,205 --> 00:39:06,173
Strange.

795
00:39:06,207 --> 00:39:09,008
I thought you were his friend.

796
00:39:10,248 --> 00:39:12,013
I suppose I am.

797
00:39:12,052 --> 00:39:14,079
Then you should let him die.

798
00:39:14,122 --> 00:39:18,222
After all, for Garak, a life
in exile is no life at all.

799
00:39:18,264 --> 00:39:22,899
Say what you will,
my job is to keep him alive

800
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:25,103
and I need your help.

801
00:39:25,144 --> 00:39:27,580
My help?
What can I do?

802
00:39:27,616 --> 00:39:30,109
The molecular structure
of Garak's leukocytes

803
00:39:30,154 --> 00:39:31,213
has been disrupted.

804
00:39:31,257 --> 00:39:33,090
I need to synthesize
replacements

805
00:39:33,127 --> 00:39:35,097
in order to stabilize
his condition.

806
00:39:35,131 --> 00:39:38,194
Unfortunately, my knowledge
of Cardassian biochemistry

807
00:39:38,237 --> 00:39:39,671
is severely limited.

808
00:39:39,706 --> 00:39:42,974
And you think I have access
to that kind of information?

809
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:45,542
Information is your business.

810
00:39:45,585 --> 00:39:48,113
Besides,
you're the one who ordered him

811
00:39:48,157 --> 00:39:50,218
to put that implant in his head,
aren't you?

812
00:39:50,261 --> 00:39:52,926
I never had to order Garak
to do anything.

813
00:39:52,967 --> 00:39:55,130
That's what made him special.

814
00:39:55,171 --> 00:39:56,503
So you're saying that

815
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:59,637
if you don't get the
information, Garak dies.

816
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,807
That's it.

817
00:40:00,848 --> 00:40:03,250
Well, we can't
allow that, can we?

818
00:40:03,287 --> 00:40:04,482
I'll see to it

819
00:40:04,523 --> 00:40:07,495
that all the necessary
data is transferred

820
00:40:07,529 --> 00:40:09,499
to your station's computers.

821
00:40:09,533 --> 00:40:10,694
Thank you.

822
00:40:10,735 --> 00:40:12,898
Oh, don't thank me.

823
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:15,376
I'm not doing Garak any favors.

824
00:40:15,411 --> 00:40:17,939
He doesn't deserve
a quick death.

825
00:40:17,983 --> 00:40:22,857
On the contrary, I want to him
to live a long, miserable life.

826
00:40:22,892 --> 00:40:25,864
I want him to grow old
on that station

827
00:40:25,898 --> 00:40:28,198
surrounded by people
who hate him

828
00:40:28,237 --> 00:40:31,471
knowing that he'll
never come home again.

829
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:34,607
What a lovely sentiment.

830
00:40:34,649 --> 00:40:38,019
And it's from the heart,
I assure you.

831
00:40:38,057 --> 00:40:42,726
And now, Doctor, I really
think you should be going.

832
00:40:42,766 --> 00:40:43,927
One last thing.

833
00:40:43,969 --> 00:40:45,403
Make it brief.

834
00:40:45,438 --> 00:40:48,604
Garak mentioned an old friend
of his the other day...

835
00:40:48,644 --> 00:40:50,477
a member
of the Obsidian Order.

836
00:40:50,515 --> 00:40:52,781
I was wondering
what happened to him.

837
00:40:52,819 --> 00:40:55,586
Did he give you
the name of this friend?

838
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:57,754
He said it was Elim.

839
00:41:00,034 --> 00:41:02,004
Elim.

840
00:41:02,038 --> 00:41:03,940
Mind letting me in on the joke?

841
00:41:03,975 --> 00:41:06,538
I can see that Garak
hasn't changed a bit.

842
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:09,073
Never tell the truth
when a lie will do.

843
00:41:09,186 --> 00:41:12,785
That man has a rare gift
for obfuscation.

844
00:41:12,826 --> 00:41:17,267
Doctor, Elim is
Garak's first name.

845
00:41:18,437 --> 00:41:20,031
Now run along home.

846
00:41:20,074 --> 00:41:24,572
And please, tell Garak
that I miss him.

847
00:41:26,286 --> 00:41:30,921
I'll be sure
to give him the message.

848
00:41:30,962 --> 00:41:34,298
Computer, one to beam up.

849
00:41:36,807 --> 00:41:39,141
Energize.

850
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:03,053
May I join you?

851
00:42:03,093 --> 00:42:04,083
Garak.

852
00:42:04,129 --> 00:42:06,599
Thank you.

853
00:42:08,637 --> 00:42:10,334
What are you doing up?

854
00:42:10,374 --> 00:42:11,928
You're supposed to be in bed.

855
00:42:12,061 --> 00:42:13,690
Out of the question.

856
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:16,464
I couldn't stand being cooped up

857
00:42:16,503 --> 00:42:19,532
in that dreadful Infirmary
for another second.

858
00:42:19,576 --> 00:42:21,876
Besides, I feel perfectly fine.

859
00:42:21,913 --> 00:42:25,546
So, how's the I'danian
spice pudding today?

860
00:42:25,588 --> 00:42:28,856
How's the spice pudding?

861
00:42:28,894 --> 00:42:31,889
Is that all you have
to say for yourself?

862
00:42:31,933 --> 00:42:33,196
How can you just sit there

863
00:42:33,237 --> 00:42:35,800
and pretend that the last
ten days never happened?

864
00:42:35,841 --> 00:42:39,302
I, for one, Doctor,
am perfectly satisfied

865
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:41,251
with the way things turned out

866
00:42:41,286 --> 00:42:44,781
and I see no need to dwell
on what was, doubtlessly

867
00:42:44,826 --> 00:42:48,287
a difficult time
for both of us.

868
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:52,797
By the way, I just had the
most interesting conversation

869
00:42:52,842 --> 00:42:54,368
with Constable Odo.

870
00:42:54,412 --> 00:42:57,111
It seems he's
under the impression

871
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:00,555
that I was a member
of the Obsidian Order.

872
00:43:00,591 --> 00:43:02,185
What did you tell him?

873
00:43:02,228 --> 00:43:04,630
That he was mistaken, of course.

874
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:06,260
And he believed you?

875
00:43:06,303 --> 00:43:07,794
Well, he said something

876
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:10,868
about keeping a closer eye on me
in the future.

877
00:43:10,911 --> 00:43:14,247
I told him, "Be my guest.
I have nothing to hide."

878
00:43:14,285 --> 00:43:17,416
Here, I've brought you
something.

879
00:43:17,458 --> 00:43:18,756
What is it?

880
00:43:18,794 --> 00:43:23,759
<i>Meditations on a Crimson Shadow</i>
by Preloc.

881
00:43:23,804 --> 00:43:26,503
More Cardassian literature.

882
00:43:26,543 --> 00:43:29,106
I think you'll find this one
more to your taste.

883
00:43:29,149 --> 00:43:30,675
It takes place in the future

884
00:43:30,718 --> 00:43:32,209
during a time when Cardassia

885
00:43:32,255 --> 00:43:34,088
and the Klingon Empire
are at war.

886
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:35,388
Who wins?

887
00:43:35,427 --> 00:43:36,895
Who do you think?

888
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:38,262
Never mind.
Don't tell me.

889
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,293
I don't want you
to spoil the ending.

890
00:43:43,009 --> 00:43:46,779
You know, I still have
a lot of questions

891
00:43:46,816 --> 00:43:49,344
to ask you about your past.

892
00:43:49,389 --> 00:43:52,623
I've given you all the answers
I'm capable of.

893
00:43:52,662 --> 00:43:54,529
You've given me answers,
all right.

894
00:43:54,566 --> 00:43:56,034
But they were all different.

895
00:43:56,136 --> 00:43:59,438
What I want to know is, out of
all the stories you've told me

896
00:43:59,475 --> 00:44:01,877
which ones were true
and which ones weren't?

897
00:44:01,913 --> 00:44:05,785
My dear Doctor,
they're all true.

898
00:44:05,821 --> 00:44:08,155
Even the lies?

899
00:44:08,193 --> 00:44:11,324
Especially the lies.
