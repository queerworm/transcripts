1
00:00:03,231 --> 00:00:06,670
Commander's Log,
Stardate 48481.2.

2
00:00:06,705 --> 00:00:08,334
My senior staff and I
have been asked

3
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,436
to address
the annual Starfleet symposium

4
00:00:10,479 --> 00:00:12,813
on the current situation
in the Gamma Quadrant.

5
00:00:12,851 --> 00:00:15,117
I'm looking forward
to the opportunity

6
00:00:15,155 --> 00:00:17,557
and to visiting
my sister in Portland.

7
00:00:18,729 --> 00:00:21,394
Entering Earth orbit.

8
00:00:21,434 --> 00:00:24,167
Now there's something
I never get tired of looking at.

9
00:00:24,206 --> 00:00:26,540
If you ask me, the seas
could be a little more purple.

10
00:00:26,578 --> 00:00:27,910
That's funny...
I was just thinking

11
00:00:27,947 --> 00:00:28,915
they weren't green enough.

12
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:30,612
I guess it's true
what they say.

13
00:00:30,653 --> 00:00:32,589
"There is no place like home."

14
00:00:32,624 --> 00:00:34,560
No matter what color
the water is.

15
00:00:34,594 --> 00:00:36,028
We'd better get ready, Benjamin.

16
00:00:36,064 --> 00:00:37,761
Dinner tonight
with Admiral Drazman.

17
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:38,996
Oh.

18
00:00:39,036 --> 00:00:40,402
Not "Droner" Drazman,
the Commander

19
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:41,737
of the Proxima
Maintenance Yards?

20
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,211
You're more than welcome
to come along.

21
00:00:44,246 --> 00:00:45,737
The entire senior staff
was invited.

22
00:00:45,783 --> 00:00:47,650
Full dress uniform?
Fine table linens?

23
00:00:47,687 --> 00:00:50,055
A different fork
for every course?

24
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:51,652
Thanks, but no thanks.

25
00:00:51,695 --> 00:00:53,129
That's why I stayed
an enlisted man.

26
00:00:53,164 --> 00:00:55,795
They don't expect me to show up
for these formal dinners.

27
00:00:55,837 --> 00:00:57,807
Major, Constable,
would you care to join us?

28
00:00:57,841 --> 00:00:59,743
No, thank you.

29
00:00:59,778 --> 00:01:03,411
I'd say this is strictly
a Starfleet occasion.

30
00:01:03,451 --> 00:01:06,048
Commander, I'm receiving
an incoming emergency message.

31
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,058
It's from DS9.

32
00:01:07,092 --> 00:01:08,458
On screen.

33
00:01:08,495 --> 00:01:11,058
Commander,
am I glad to see you.

34
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,899
This better be good, Quark.

35
00:01:12,937 --> 00:01:14,770
You're on an emergency channel.

36
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:17,244
I just received a message
from the Grand Nagus.

37
00:01:17,346 --> 00:01:20,375
He wants me to remind you
of the critical role he played

38
00:01:20,419 --> 00:01:23,118
in establishing contact
with the Dominion.

39
00:01:23,158 --> 00:01:25,560
You can assure the Nagus
I will mention his assistance

40
00:01:25,596 --> 00:01:27,862
prominently in my report
to Starfleet.

41
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:30,429
There is one more thing,
Commander.

42
00:01:30,472 --> 00:01:32,408
It seems the Nagus' nephew,
Belongo

43
00:01:32,443 --> 00:01:34,140
is currently being held

44
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,482
by Starfleet authorities
on Aldebaran III.

45
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:40,457
A slight misunderstanding,
I'm sure.

46
00:01:40,492 --> 00:01:44,489
A misunderstanding the Nagus
no doubt wants to be cleared up.

47
00:01:44,533 --> 00:01:46,503
I do owe him a favor.

48
00:01:46,537 --> 00:01:47,869
He thinks so, too.

49
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:51,141
And to quote
the 111th Rule of Acquisition...

50
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,587
"Treat people in your debt
like family... exploit them."

51
00:01:55,623 --> 00:01:57,593
I have been reading up.

52
00:01:57,627 --> 00:02:00,895
You can tell the Nagus
I will do everything I can

53
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:04,839
but also remind him of the
217th Rule of Acquisition...

54
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,640
"You can't free a fish
from water."

55
00:02:08,147 --> 00:02:11,278
I'll be sure the Nagus
gets the message.

56
00:02:18,034 --> 00:02:19,765
She's all yours, Major.

57
00:02:19,804 --> 00:02:21,501
Energize, Mr. O'Brien.

58
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:22,873
Aye, sir.

59
00:02:26,183 --> 00:02:27,651
That's strange.

60
00:02:27,687 --> 00:02:29,316
What's wrong?

61
00:02:29,356 --> 00:02:30,756
Well, nothing serious.

62
00:02:30,793 --> 00:02:32,227
Just a power fluctuation

63
00:02:32,262 --> 00:02:34,528
in the annular
confinement beam.

64
00:02:36,972 --> 00:02:38,908
Oh, well, that's impossible.

65
00:02:38,943 --> 00:02:40,206
What happened?

66
00:02:40,245 --> 00:02:43,740
Well, I stabilized the beam,
but according to our sensors

67
00:02:43,786 --> 00:02:46,018
they never materialized
at their destination.

68
00:02:46,057 --> 00:02:48,893
They're just... gone.

69
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:54,300
Okay, buddy, come on.
Rise and shine.

70
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,333
Come on!

71
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:57,777
Well, look what we have here.

72
00:02:57,814 --> 00:02:58,782
Who are you?

73
00:02:58,816 --> 00:02:59,784
Who am I?

74
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:00,979
You believe this?

75
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,787
Sleeping Beauty
asking me questions. Up!

76
00:03:08,702 --> 00:03:10,797
Hey, Vin, we've been
working all night.

77
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,641
Why don't we forget
about these guys?

78
00:03:13,678 --> 00:03:14,873
I just want to go home

79
00:03:14,914 --> 00:03:16,975
and see Sonya and the kids
and get some sleep.

80
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:18,453
What are you, an anarchist?

81
00:03:18,488 --> 00:03:20,958
There's a law against
sleeping in the streets.

82
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:23,897
Though I do like
the matching pajamas.

83
00:03:23,932 --> 00:03:25,902
All right.
Let's see some logo.

84
00:03:25,936 --> 00:03:27,565
Logo?

85
00:03:27,606 --> 00:03:29,132
I.D. Identification.

86
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:30,702
UHC card.

87
00:03:30,746 --> 00:03:32,214
Transit pass.

88
00:03:32,249 --> 00:03:33,342
Where are we?

89
00:03:33,384 --> 00:03:35,183
What happened
to Starfleet Headquarters?

90
00:03:35,221 --> 00:03:37,886
Perfect. Just what we need,
two more dims.

91
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:39,395
Those shotguns, uniforms...

92
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,764
there's something
very familiar about this.

93
00:03:41,802 --> 00:03:43,704
Yeah, probably
from the last time

94
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:45,402
you were
in a Sanctuary District.

95
00:03:45,442 --> 00:03:47,412
Sanctuary District?
What year is this?

96
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:50,110
Same year as it was yesterday...
2024.

97
00:03:50,151 --> 00:03:51,814
Let's go.

98
00:03:55,161 --> 00:03:57,154
How do they find us?

99
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:13,349
Are you okay?

100
00:06:13,395 --> 00:06:14,829
Oh, my head.

101
00:06:14,864 --> 00:06:16,196
What happened?

102
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:17,735
Did you get jacked
or something?

103
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:18,795
Jacked?

104
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,433
You know, robbed.

105
00:06:20,475 --> 00:06:23,140
Oh...

106
00:06:23,181 --> 00:06:25,812
Did they get your
credit chips, your I. D?

107
00:06:27,556 --> 00:06:29,856
Oh... it looks like
they got everything

108
00:06:29,895 --> 00:06:32,161
except my broach.

109
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,396
What? Do you
live near here, uh?

110
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:36,134
Can you get home?

111
00:06:36,174 --> 00:06:38,041
I was traveling
with some friends

112
00:06:38,078 --> 00:06:40,914
and uh, I guess
we got separated.

113
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,920
Well, you shouldn't
be walking around

114
00:06:42,954 --> 00:06:44,252
without I.D.

115
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,522
You better order
some replacements.

116
00:06:46,561 --> 00:06:50,000
You can use my Interface
terminal, if you wish.

117
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,062
My office is just
around the corner.

118
00:06:52,106 --> 00:06:54,076
That's very kind of you... um?

119
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,078
Chris, Chris Brynner.

120
00:06:55,112 --> 00:06:56,239
Jadzia.

121
00:06:56,281 --> 00:06:57,613
That's a pretty name.

122
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,483
What is that, Dutch?

123
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,149
Ah, something like that.

124
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,387
It's very kind of you
to help me.

125
00:07:03,428 --> 00:07:04,555
Oh, don't mention it.

126
00:07:04,597 --> 00:07:05,895
It's not every day

127
00:07:05,934 --> 00:07:08,097
that I get to rescue
a damsel in distress.

128
00:07:08,138 --> 00:07:09,698
Let me help you.

129
00:07:16,554 --> 00:07:18,387
It's just this way.

130
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,850
Check the Heisenberg
compensators.

131
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:34,685
I'll run a level-1 diagnostic
of the pattern buffers.

132
00:07:34,724 --> 00:07:36,694
See if there was
any kind of field imbalance.

133
00:07:36,728 --> 00:07:37,718
Chief?

134
00:07:37,763 --> 00:07:38,788
Any news from Starfleet?

135
00:07:38,832 --> 00:07:39,925
Nothing good.

136
00:07:39,968 --> 00:07:41,995
As far as they can tell,
Commander Sisko and the others

137
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:44,407
never materialized
in San Francisco.

138
00:07:44,443 --> 00:07:46,106
According to their sensors

139
00:07:46,147 --> 00:07:48,310
our transporter signal
disintegrated

140
00:07:48,418 --> 00:07:50,718
immediately after we began
the beam-out sequence.

141
00:07:50,756 --> 00:07:52,623
That doesn't agree
with our records.

142
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:53,718
The system log shows

143
00:07:53,762 --> 00:07:55,823
that the transport
was successfully completed.

144
00:07:55,866 --> 00:07:57,597
They definitely
materialized somewhere.

145
00:07:57,636 --> 00:07:58,968
Well, that's good news, anyway

146
00:07:59,006 --> 00:08:00,532
but the question is,
where?

147
00:08:00,575 --> 00:08:01,668
Oh, I wish I knew.

148
00:08:01,711 --> 00:08:04,113
Whatever the answer is,
it's not in the log.

149
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,983
The only unusual thing
it recorded

150
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,890
was the variance in the annular
confinement beam.

151
00:08:08,925 --> 00:08:10,291
But you corrected for that.

152
00:08:10,362 --> 00:08:11,591
It was a simple adjustment.

153
00:08:11,631 --> 00:08:13,692
The beam was just reacting
to the accumulation

154
00:08:13,735 --> 00:08:15,671
of chroniton particles
on the ship's hull.

155
00:08:15,705 --> 00:08:17,937
Chroniton particles?

156
00:08:17,976 --> 00:08:19,502
They're emitted
by the cloaking device.

157
00:08:19,547 --> 00:08:20,708
They sometimes become lodged

158
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:22,275
in the ship's ablative
armor matrix.

159
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,982
But we've used the transporter

160
00:08:24,023 --> 00:08:26,186
many times since the cloaking
device was installed.

161
00:08:26,227 --> 00:08:28,197
There's never been
a problem before.

162
00:08:28,231 --> 00:08:30,724
I don't know
why there should be one now.

163
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:32,329
Wait a minute.

164
00:08:32,439 --> 00:08:35,673
It looks like there was a surge
in temporal energy

165
00:08:35,712 --> 00:08:37,875
seconds before the initiation
of the transporter sequence.

166
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,715
Tell me that's a clue.

167
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:41,723
Oh, it's a clue, all right.

168
00:08:41,757 --> 00:08:43,454
I just don't know
what it means yet.

169
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,017
How do you feel?

170
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:00,322
Better.

171
00:09:00,362 --> 00:09:01,421
Me, too.

172
00:09:01,464 --> 00:09:02,727
Probably transporter shock.

173
00:09:02,766 --> 00:09:04,668
Disorienting, but it
wears off quickly.

174
00:09:04,703 --> 00:09:05,671
I know one thing.

175
00:09:05,705 --> 00:09:06,866
We're definitely
in San Francisco.

176
00:09:06,908 --> 00:09:08,434
I caught a glimpse
of the Golden Gate Bridge

177
00:09:08,478 --> 00:09:09,446
a few blocks back.

178
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,812
I saw it, too.

179
00:09:10,849 --> 00:09:12,842
Do you know what happened
to our combadges?

180
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,483
They were probably stolen
while we were unconscious.

181
00:09:15,525 --> 00:09:17,927
This is not the Earth
we're used to, Doctor.

182
00:09:17,963 --> 00:09:20,365
That's still at least
a century away.

183
00:09:20,468 --> 00:09:22,461
I wonder what happened to Dax.

184
00:09:22,506 --> 00:09:24,635
She was caught in the
transporter beam with us.

185
00:09:24,677 --> 00:09:27,011
Whatever affected us,
must have affected her, too.

186
00:09:27,048 --> 00:09:29,177
That means she's probably
somewhere nearby.

187
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,819
The first chance we get,
we've got to find her.

188
00:09:32,859 --> 00:09:34,453
And then what?

189
00:09:35,865 --> 00:09:38,335
And then, we find a way home.

190
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:40,364
All right, let's go.
Bring them.

191
00:09:40,408 --> 00:09:42,537
Okay, let's go.
Hurry it up.

192
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:45,912
Sonya's going to kill me.

193
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:46,942
Huh.

194
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,200
What is this place?

195
00:09:53,234 --> 00:09:54,965
A Sanctuary District.

196
00:09:55,004 --> 00:09:58,705
21st century history is
not one of my strong points.

197
00:09:58,745 --> 00:10:00,374
Too depressing.

198
00:10:00,415 --> 00:10:02,112
It's been a hobby of mine.

199
00:10:02,152 --> 00:10:03,917
They made some ugly mistakes.

200
00:10:03,955 --> 00:10:05,686
But they also paved the way

201
00:10:05,725 --> 00:10:08,322
for a lot of things
we now take for granted.

202
00:10:08,364 --> 00:10:11,393
And I assume this is
one of those mistakes.

203
00:10:11,437 --> 00:10:12,735
A bad one.

204
00:10:12,773 --> 00:10:15,039
By the early 2020s,
there was a place

205
00:10:15,077 --> 00:10:17,479
like this in every major
city in the United States.

206
00:10:17,582 --> 00:10:19,347
Why are these people in here?

207
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:20,479
Are they criminals?

208
00:10:20,555 --> 00:10:22,252
No, people with criminal records

209
00:10:22,292 --> 00:10:24,820
weren't allowed
in the Sanctuary Districts.

210
00:10:24,863 --> 00:10:27,994
Then what did they do
to deserve this?

211
00:10:28,036 --> 00:10:29,129
Nothing.

212
00:10:29,173 --> 00:10:33,341
Just people without jobs
or places to live.

213
00:10:33,381 --> 00:10:35,180
So, they get put in here?

214
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,620
Welcome to the 21st century,
Doctor.

215
00:10:37,656 --> 00:10:39,956
Hold it right there.

216
00:10:39,993 --> 00:10:41,427
You want to go home, go home.

217
00:10:41,464 --> 00:10:42,762
What do I care?

218
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,290
Thanks, Vin.

219
00:10:47,007 --> 00:10:48,670
Shall we?

220
00:11:10,922 --> 00:11:12,049
Hi.

221
00:11:12,091 --> 00:11:15,325
Sorry to keep you waiting.

222
00:11:15,365 --> 00:11:17,858
Were you able to order
a new I. D?

223
00:11:17,903 --> 00:11:19,235
Just finished.

224
00:11:19,273 --> 00:11:21,300
It took me a while
to convince them

225
00:11:21,343 --> 00:11:23,438
I was who I said I was.

226
00:11:23,481 --> 00:11:25,075
They'll be expressing
a transit pass

227
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:27,144
and a couple of credit
chips in a few hours.

228
00:11:27,189 --> 00:11:28,521
I asked them to send it here.

229
00:11:28,558 --> 00:11:29,526
I hope you don't mind.

230
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,550
No problem.

231
00:11:30,628 --> 00:11:32,188
Thanks for letting me

232
00:11:32,232 --> 00:11:34,395
use your terminal
and your account.

233
00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:42,445
You know, those are
very unusual.

234
00:11:42,486 --> 00:11:44,422
Oh, you mean my tattoos?

235
00:11:44,456 --> 00:11:46,016
It is amazing work.

236
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:47,585
Where did you have them done?
Japan?

237
00:11:47,662 --> 00:11:49,153
How did you guess?

238
00:11:49,198 --> 00:11:51,361
Well, I used
to have one myself.

239
00:11:51,403 --> 00:11:52,963
A Maori tribal pattern.

240
00:11:53,006 --> 00:11:55,203
It used to go all
the way down my arm.

241
00:11:55,245 --> 00:11:57,613
I got it in high school,
back in the '90s

242
00:11:57,649 --> 00:11:59,551
just like everybody else.

243
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:01,283
Of course, I had
to have it removed.

244
00:12:01,323 --> 00:12:03,054
Well, you know how it is.

245
00:12:03,093 --> 00:12:06,293
To get the government contracts,
you have to look like

246
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,326
all the rest of the drones.

247
00:12:08,371 --> 00:12:10,568
So I guess
that makes me a sellout.

248
00:12:10,675 --> 00:12:12,143
Not necessarily.

249
00:12:12,177 --> 00:12:14,579
What kind of business do you do?

250
00:12:14,683 --> 00:12:16,015
You don't know?

251
00:12:16,052 --> 00:12:17,715
Mm-mm.

252
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,826
Well, I guess
I'll have to have a talk

253
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:25,268
with my public relations people.

254
00:12:25,305 --> 00:12:27,104
I'm Chris Brynner...

255
00:12:27,141 --> 00:12:30,477
Brynner Information Systems.

256
00:12:30,515 --> 00:12:34,455
You know, Interface operations,
Net access, Channel 90.

257
00:12:34,489 --> 00:12:37,359
That Chris Brynner.

258
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:41,624
So, what do you think?

259
00:12:41,704 --> 00:12:43,833
Does that make me
a sellout or not?

260
00:12:43,874 --> 00:12:47,541
Probably, but I won't hold it
against you.

261
00:12:47,582 --> 00:12:51,249
These friends of yours
that you told me about...

262
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:54,889
is there any way for you
to get ahold of them?

263
00:12:56,834 --> 00:12:58,827
I wish I could.

264
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,643
Left hand.

265
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,823
Other hand.

266
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:19,700
Look straight ahead.

267
00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:23,212
Now stand over here.

268
00:13:27,896 --> 00:13:31,859
Welcome to SafeTech's
fingerprint database.

269
00:13:31,904 --> 00:13:35,674
Your government discount
has been accepted.

270
00:13:35,712 --> 00:13:37,642
Remember,
our new retinal scan service

271
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,211
is now accessible
on Channel 178.

272
00:13:40,246 --> 00:13:42,580
Yeah, yeah,
save the commercial.

273
00:13:45,256 --> 00:13:46,850
We are sorry

274
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:49,729
but the fingerprints you have
provided are not on record.

275
00:13:49,766 --> 00:13:52,704
No I.D.,
no fingerprint record

276
00:13:52,739 --> 00:13:54,139
no Interface account.

277
00:13:54,174 --> 00:13:57,146
It's like you two don't exist.

278
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,616
Well, since we don't exist,
why not let us go?

279
00:13:59,652 --> 00:14:01,588
Yeah, well, let's see.

280
00:14:01,623 --> 00:14:04,561
You don't have any I.D.,
you don't have any money

281
00:14:04,596 --> 00:14:06,759
and you're both
dressed like clowns.

282
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,827
You figure it out.

283
00:14:08,871 --> 00:14:10,738
Please fill out these forms.

284
00:14:10,775 --> 00:14:12,711
Answer all questions
to the best of your ability.

285
00:14:12,745 --> 00:14:15,181
If you cannot speak English,
an interpreter will be provided.

286
00:14:15,216 --> 00:14:18,279
If you cannot read, questions
will be given to you verbally.

287
00:14:18,322 --> 00:14:20,656
If there's any part of this form
you do not understand

288
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,220
ask one of our staff
for assistance.

289
00:14:22,264 --> 00:14:25,202
Now, sit down, shut up
and fill out the forms.

290
00:14:25,236 --> 00:14:27,799
And if you've got any problems,
don't come to me with them.

291
00:14:27,842 --> 00:14:30,039
Thank you...

292
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,946
very much.

293
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:39,530
Tell Admiral Ngomo
I appreciate her offer

294
00:14:39,566 --> 00:14:41,729
but I don't want anyone
beaming onto this ship

295
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,170
until we know what's going on.

296
00:14:43,206 --> 00:14:45,676
If they want to come up
by shuttle, that's fine.

297
00:14:47,715 --> 00:14:49,810
Major, I think
I know what happened

298
00:14:49,853 --> 00:14:51,948
to Commander Sisko
and the others.

299
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:54,017
The temporal surge we detected

300
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:57,522
was caused by an explosion
of a microscopic singularity

301
00:14:57,568 --> 00:14:59,435
passing through
this solar system.

302
00:14:59,472 --> 00:15:00,633
Somehow, the energy emitted

303
00:15:00,674 --> 00:15:02,871
by this singularity shifted
the chroniton particles

304
00:15:02,912 --> 00:15:06,818
in our hull into a high state
of temporal polarization.

305
00:15:06,853 --> 00:15:08,321
Which means what?

306
00:15:08,356 --> 00:15:10,292
Which means the transporter beam
was redirected

307
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,228
as it passed
through the polarized particles.

308
00:15:12,264 --> 00:15:14,257
Redirected where?

309
00:15:14,301 --> 00:15:15,769
Not where... when.

310
00:15:15,804 --> 00:15:18,742
The beam was redirected
through time, not space.

311
00:15:18,777 --> 00:15:21,578
They arrived in San Francisco,
just like they were supposed to.

312
00:15:21,616 --> 00:15:24,281
But not when
they were supposed to.

313
00:15:24,321 --> 00:15:28,022
How much time are we
talking about... days, weeks?

314
00:15:28,062 --> 00:15:30,590
More like centuries.

315
00:15:49,237 --> 00:15:50,330
This is ridiculous.

316
00:15:50,373 --> 00:15:52,366
I mean, we've
been here three hours

317
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,539
and the line has
barely moved at all.

318
00:15:54,582 --> 00:15:58,249
I got one word for you, pal...
plenty of overtime.

319
00:15:58,289 --> 00:15:59,883
That's three words.

320
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:01,828
Hey, for a dim,
you're pretty smart.

321
00:16:01,863 --> 00:16:03,297
Now, go back and take a seat.

322
00:16:06,706 --> 00:16:09,108
Oh, boy.

323
00:16:35,597 --> 00:16:38,398
Some of these people
are mentally ill.

324
00:16:38,436 --> 00:16:40,736
They need proper
medical treatment.

325
00:16:40,774 --> 00:16:42,767
I know, but they're
not going to get it.

326
00:16:42,812 --> 00:16:44,041
Not now anyway.

327
00:16:46,151 --> 00:16:48,178
What? What is it?

328
00:16:48,289 --> 00:16:50,020
That calendar over there...

329
00:16:50,059 --> 00:16:51,892
it says August 30, 2024.

330
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,125
I'm not sure I understand.

331
00:16:53,165 --> 00:16:54,656
You ever hear of the Bell Riots?

332
00:16:54,702 --> 00:16:55,931
Vaguely.

333
00:16:55,971 --> 00:16:58,407
It is one of the most
violent civil disturbances

334
00:16:58,442 --> 00:16:59,432
in American history

335
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:01,710
and it happened right here...
San Francisco

336
00:17:01,749 --> 00:17:03,343
Sanctuary District "A"

337
00:17:03,385 --> 00:17:05,719
the first week of September,
2024.

338
00:17:05,757 --> 00:17:08,558
But that's only
a few days from now.

339
00:17:08,597 --> 00:17:10,726
Which means if we don't
get out of here soon

340
00:17:10,767 --> 00:17:13,500
we'll be caught
right in the middle of it.

341
00:17:23,325 --> 00:17:26,695
Just how bad are these riots
going to be, Commander?

342
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:28,201
Bad.

343
00:17:28,235 --> 00:17:31,469
The Sanctuary residents
will take over the district.

344
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,307
Some of the guards
will be taken hostage.

345
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:36,579
The government will send
in troops to restore order.

346
00:17:36,619 --> 00:17:39,557
Hundreds of Sanctuary
residents will be killed.

347
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:41,083
Hundreds?

348
00:17:43,098 --> 00:17:45,398
And there's nothing
we can do to prevent it.

349
00:17:45,436 --> 00:17:48,374
Starfleet temporal
displacement policy

350
00:17:48,409 --> 00:17:49,877
may sound good in the classroom

351
00:17:49,912 --> 00:17:52,645
but to know that hundreds
of people are going to die

352
00:17:52,685 --> 00:17:56,489
and to not be able to do
a thing to save them.

353
00:17:56,525 --> 00:18:00,761
I sympathize, Doctor, but if it
will make you feel any better

354
00:18:00,801 --> 00:18:03,294
the riots will be one
of the watershed events

355
00:18:03,339 --> 00:18:05,036
of the 21st century.

356
00:18:05,076 --> 00:18:07,137
Gabriel Bell will see to that.

357
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,307
Bell?

358
00:18:08,349 --> 00:18:09,909
The man they named
the riots after.

359
00:18:09,952 --> 00:18:12,149
He is one
of the Sanctuary residents

360
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,217
who will be guarding
the hostages.

361
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:16,320
The government troops
will storm this place

362
00:18:16,365 --> 00:18:18,494
based on rumors that the
hostages have been killed.

363
00:18:18,535 --> 00:18:22,134
It turns out
the hostages were never harmed

364
00:18:22,176 --> 00:18:23,873
because of Gabriel Bell.

365
00:18:23,913 --> 00:18:27,717
In the end, Bell sacrifices
his own life to save them.

366
00:18:27,755 --> 00:18:30,089
He'll become a national hero.

367
00:18:30,126 --> 00:18:32,119
Outrage over his death
and the death

368
00:18:32,163 --> 00:18:34,964
of the other residents
will change public opinion

369
00:18:35,002 --> 00:18:36,470
about the Sanctuaries.

370
00:18:36,505 --> 00:18:37,905
They'll be torn down.

371
00:18:37,941 --> 00:18:40,002
And the United States
will finally begin

372
00:18:40,046 --> 00:18:42,209
correcting the social problems

373
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,813
it had struggled with
for over 100 years.

374
00:18:44,855 --> 00:18:47,952
And all of this is going
to happen in the next few days.

375
00:18:47,995 --> 00:18:50,967
Which means, if we warn these
people about what's coming

376
00:18:51,001 --> 00:18:53,164
if we try to help them
in any way

377
00:18:53,205 --> 00:18:56,234
we risk altering
a pivotal moment in history

378
00:18:56,278 --> 00:18:59,911
and we can't let that happen.

379
00:18:59,952 --> 00:19:01,113
Hey, I hate to break up

380
00:19:01,154 --> 00:19:03,147
your intimate conversation,
but you're next.

381
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:21,093
Is there something wrong?

382
00:19:21,128 --> 00:19:24,294
Well, according to these forms
you're supposed to be dims

383
00:19:24,334 --> 00:19:25,632
but you're not, are you?

384
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,765
I hope you're not disappointed.

385
00:19:27,808 --> 00:19:29,778
Pleasantly surprised
is more like it.

386
00:19:29,812 --> 00:19:31,303
I guess I owe you an apology.

387
00:19:31,415 --> 00:19:34,251
If I had known you were gimmes,
I could've processed

388
00:19:34,287 --> 00:19:36,314
your application much sooner.

389
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,324
Gimmes?

390
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:39,090
They're American slang terms.

391
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,623
I try not to use them,
but it's a bad habit.

392
00:19:41,668 --> 00:19:45,072
Gimmes are people like you,
people who are looking for help.

393
00:19:45,109 --> 00:19:46,577
A job, a place to live.

394
00:19:46,611 --> 00:19:48,513
And what about the dims?

395
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:50,314
Don't they need help?

396
00:19:50,352 --> 00:19:51,878
The dims should be in hospitals

397
00:19:51,923 --> 00:19:54,359
but the government can't
afford to keep them there

398
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:55,622
so we get them instead.

399
00:19:55,663 --> 00:19:58,464
I hate it,
but that's the way it is.

400
00:19:58,502 --> 00:20:01,941
I see here that you both have
just arrived in San Francisco.

401
00:20:01,976 --> 00:20:03,553
Do you have any jobs lined up?

402
00:20:03,685 --> 00:20:05,814
No. Um, actually,
we weren't planning

403
00:20:05,857 --> 00:20:07,656
on staying here very long.

404
00:20:07,693 --> 00:20:10,358
Have you got a place to stay,
or anyone who can vouch for you?

405
00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:13,998
No, we were traveling with
a friend, but we were separated

406
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,406
right after we arrived.

407
00:20:15,442 --> 00:20:17,776
You have any way of contacting
this friend of yours?

408
00:20:17,814 --> 00:20:19,443
Not at the moment.

409
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:20,645
Well, in that case

410
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:23,522
I'm afraid you're going
to have to stay here

411
00:20:23,558 --> 00:20:25,892
in the Sanctuary
for the time being.

412
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,057
You mean we can't leave?

413
00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:28,590
It's for your own safety.

414
00:20:28,635 --> 00:20:29,728
Really?

415
00:20:29,772 --> 00:20:31,240
And it's the law.

416
00:20:31,274 --> 00:20:32,800
What about jobs?

417
00:20:32,844 --> 00:20:35,246
How are we supposed
to find a place to work

418
00:20:35,349 --> 00:20:37,946
and somewhere to live
if we're stuck in here?

419
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:41,085
Well, one of the services
we provide is job placement.

420
00:20:41,127 --> 00:20:43,029
And how long does
that usually take?

421
00:20:43,065 --> 00:20:46,094
I wish I could give you
a definite answer

422
00:20:46,137 --> 00:20:48,607
but jobs are hard
to come by right now

423
00:20:48,642 --> 00:20:50,578
what with the economy and all.

424
00:20:50,612 --> 00:20:52,980
My advice is to be patient.

425
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:55,581
In the meantime, take these.

426
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:57,854
They're your ration cards.

427
00:20:57,894 --> 00:20:59,523
You can use them
to get food and water

428
00:20:59,564 --> 00:21:01,796
at any of the distribution
points in the district.

429
00:21:01,836 --> 00:21:03,134
Hang onto them.

430
00:21:03,171 --> 00:21:06,075
Where are we supposed to stay
while we're here?

431
00:21:06,111 --> 00:21:07,579
Anywhere you like.

432
00:21:07,613 --> 00:21:10,141
The buildings in the district
are there for everyone to use.

433
00:21:11,956 --> 00:21:14,222
Thanks for your help.

434
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,889
One more thing.

435
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:17,559
A little advice.

436
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,627
Stay away
from district security.

437
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,833
They've had
their budget cut again.

438
00:21:21,876 --> 00:21:24,108
They're overworked
and underpaid.

439
00:21:24,147 --> 00:21:27,551
Just give them a lot of space,
and watch out for ghosts.

440
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:28,554
Ghosts?

441
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:29,681
That's what we call

442
00:21:29,724 --> 00:21:32,252
people who haven't integrated
well into the Sanctuary.

443
00:21:32,296 --> 00:21:33,856
They can be dangerous

444
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,870
and they tend to prey
on other residents.

445
00:21:37,006 --> 00:21:38,235
Thanks for the warning.

446
00:21:38,275 --> 00:21:39,801
We'll stay away from them.

447
00:21:43,718 --> 00:21:45,847
Dax to Sisko.

448
00:21:47,693 --> 00:21:48,661
Dax to Bashir.

449
00:21:48,695 --> 00:21:50,858
If you can hear me,
please respond.

450
00:21:55,309 --> 00:21:56,938
Okay.

451
00:21:56,979 --> 00:21:59,074
My assistant was able to get you

452
00:21:59,116 --> 00:22:02,111
a room at the Clift
for the next five nights.

453
00:22:02,156 --> 00:22:04,058
You didn't have to do that.

454
00:22:04,093 --> 00:22:06,120
I know that, but I wanted to.

455
00:22:06,164 --> 00:22:07,963
So, uh, what are your plans?

456
00:22:08,001 --> 00:22:10,802
I still have to find my friends.

457
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,639
Well, I hope you don't mind

458
00:22:12,676 --> 00:22:14,202
but I had Britt
do some checking.

459
00:22:14,247 --> 00:22:16,775
No one matching their
descriptions has been admitted

460
00:22:16,818 --> 00:22:19,311
to any of the city hospitals
or trauma wards.

461
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,653
That's good news.

462
00:22:20,692 --> 00:22:23,994
Look, uh, I would like to know
how this turns out.

463
00:22:24,033 --> 00:22:27,996
I'm having a little get-together
here tomorrow in the office

464
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:29,738
and I'd like you to come...

465
00:22:29,777 --> 00:22:32,111
if you want...
you and your friends.

466
00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:33,709
I'd like that.

467
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,298
Well, good luck.

468
00:22:41,334 --> 00:22:43,327
Thanks. I could use it.

469
00:22:49,417 --> 00:22:51,785
Whoa. You guys
can't come in here.

470
00:22:51,821 --> 00:22:53,916
We're just looking
for somewhere to sleep.

471
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,021
Well, you're going to have
to look someplace else.

472
00:22:56,064 --> 00:22:58,592
Oh, let me guess...
this building is full.

473
00:22:58,635 --> 00:22:59,864
Sorry.

474
00:23:01,874 --> 00:23:04,573
Every building we go to,
it's the same story.

475
00:23:04,613 --> 00:23:06,173
They can't all be full.

476
00:23:06,217 --> 00:23:07,480
Don't be so sure.

477
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:08,953
One of the main complaints

478
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,187
against the Sanctuary Districts
was overcrowding.

479
00:23:11,227 --> 00:23:13,094
It got to the point
where they didn't care

480
00:23:13,131 --> 00:23:14,760
how many people were in here.

481
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,736
They just wanted
to keep them out of sight.

482
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:20,005
And once they were out of sight,
what then?

483
00:23:21,447 --> 00:23:23,474
I mean, look at this man.

484
00:23:23,518 --> 00:23:26,957
There's no need for him
to live like that.

485
00:23:26,992 --> 00:23:29,053
With the right medication

486
00:23:29,096 --> 00:23:31,066
he could lead a full
and normal life.

487
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,729
Maybe in our time.

488
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,261
Not just in our time.

489
00:23:34,306 --> 00:23:37,073
There are any number
of effective treatments

490
00:23:37,112 --> 00:23:39,913
for schizophrenia,
even in this day and age.

491
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:41,853
They could cure
that man now, today

492
00:23:41,888 --> 00:23:43,356
if they gave a damn.

493
00:23:43,391 --> 00:23:45,691
It's not that they
don't give a damn

494
00:23:45,729 --> 00:23:47,722
they've just given up.

495
00:23:47,766 --> 00:23:53,141
The social problems they face
seem too enormous to deal with.

496
00:23:53,178 --> 00:23:55,843
Well, that only makes things
worse.

497
00:23:55,882 --> 00:23:58,011
Causing people to suffer

498
00:23:58,054 --> 00:24:00,719
because you hate them
is terrible

499
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:03,025
but causing people to suffer

500
00:24:03,064 --> 00:24:05,159
because you have
forgotten how to care...

501
00:24:06,838 --> 00:24:09,035
that's really hard
to understand.

502
00:24:09,076 --> 00:24:10,841
They'll remember.

503
00:24:10,879 --> 00:24:13,851
It will take some time,
and it won't be easy

504
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:16,686
but eventually,
people in this century

505
00:24:16,724 --> 00:24:18,694
will remember how to care.

506
00:24:18,728 --> 00:24:23,670
Right, only it makes
you wonder, doesn't it?

507
00:24:23,705 --> 00:24:29,205
Are humans really any different
than Cardassians or Romulans?

508
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:33,748
If push comes to shove,
if something disastrous

509
00:24:33,791 --> 00:24:36,957
happens to the Federation,
if we are frightened enough

510
00:24:36,999 --> 00:24:38,730
or desperate enough

511
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,931
how would we react?

512
00:24:40,972 --> 00:24:44,878
Would we stay true to our ideals

513
00:24:44,914 --> 00:24:47,977
or would we just stay here

514
00:24:48,021 --> 00:24:51,187
right back where we started?

515
00:24:51,227 --> 00:24:53,322
I don't know.

516
00:24:53,364 --> 00:24:56,495
But as a Starfleet officer

517
00:24:56,604 --> 00:25:00,738
it's my job to make sure
we never have to find out.

518
00:25:08,828 --> 00:25:10,319
Get his food card.

519
00:25:10,365 --> 00:25:13,964
Remember, Doctor,
we can't interfere.

520
00:25:14,005 --> 00:25:16,066
You got a problem?

521
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,704
No problem.

522
00:25:17,746 --> 00:25:19,477
You look upset.

523
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,952
If we've done anything
to offend you

524
00:25:21,988 --> 00:25:25,290
please let us know, so that we
can be sure not to do it again.

525
00:25:25,328 --> 00:25:26,854
Don't worry about us.

526
00:25:26,897 --> 00:25:28,024
We're new here.

527
00:25:28,067 --> 00:25:30,469
Really?
I never would have guessed.

528
00:25:30,505 --> 00:25:33,909
But let me be the first
to welcome you.

529
00:25:33,945 --> 00:25:36,245
Would you like a piece of this?

530
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,718
No, thanks.

531
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,521
Gimmes...

532
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,860
no sense of fun.

533
00:25:43,898 --> 00:25:46,802
We're just looking
for a place to sleep.

534
00:25:49,076 --> 00:25:51,069
Well, in that case...

535
00:25:51,113 --> 00:25:53,983
you better look
somewhere else...

536
00:25:54,018 --> 00:25:55,647
new boy.

537
00:25:58,194 --> 00:25:59,788
You heard what he said.

538
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,162
Let's go.

539
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,269
Enjoy your stay!

540
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,280
And in a few days

541
00:26:08,314 --> 00:26:12,516
I know you're going
to feel right at home.

542
00:26:12,556 --> 00:26:14,423
Bye!

543
00:26:25,548 --> 00:26:29,386
So, in theory, we should be able
to travel into the past

544
00:26:29,423 --> 00:26:31,290
by focusing
the transporter beam

545
00:26:31,327 --> 00:26:34,265
through the polarized
chroniton particles.

546
00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:35,699
The problem is, we don't know

547
00:26:35,735 --> 00:26:37,762
where in time Sisko
and the others are.

548
00:26:37,806 --> 00:26:38,899
I've narrowed it down

549
00:26:38,941 --> 00:26:40,570
to a dozen
different possibilities

550
00:26:40,678 --> 00:26:43,171
but we only have
enough polarized chronitons

551
00:26:43,217 --> 00:26:44,846
to make five or six attempts.

552
00:26:44,887 --> 00:26:47,187
Then we'll have
to take our chances.

553
00:26:47,225 --> 00:26:49,320
Pick the most likely
time periods

554
00:26:49,363 --> 00:26:51,595
and send a team down
with tricorders to find them.

555
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,226
The hard part will be

556
00:26:53,271 --> 00:26:55,868
to find a couple of
volunteers crazy enough

557
00:26:55,909 --> 00:26:58,072
to risk getting lost in time
to do the job.

558
00:26:58,113 --> 00:27:00,524
I think I know
a few likely candidates.

559
00:27:19,896 --> 00:27:21,798
Here you go, Julian.

560
00:27:21,834 --> 00:27:24,806
Oh... oh...

561
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:29,841
Oh...

562
00:27:29,883 --> 00:27:33,755
If we ever get home,
I promise never to complain

563
00:27:33,791 --> 00:27:37,731
about the station's
Cardassian beds ever again.

564
00:27:39,736 --> 00:27:41,433
Oh, where is everybody?

565
00:27:41,473 --> 00:27:44,206
In the food lines,
waiting for breakfast.

566
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:47,981
It's not much to look at,
but it's better than nothing.

567
00:27:48,019 --> 00:27:49,044
Uh, I'm sorry.

568
00:27:49,088 --> 00:27:50,579
They ran out of utensils

569
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:52,185
and napkins.

570
00:27:52,228 --> 00:27:54,027
Why am I not surprised?

571
00:27:54,065 --> 00:27:56,126
When you're finished eating,
I think we should get up

572
00:27:56,169 --> 00:27:57,637
on the roof
of one of these buildings.

573
00:27:57,672 --> 00:27:59,301
I want to get a better look
at the place.

574
00:27:59,342 --> 00:28:01,403
Do you think
there's a way out of here?

575
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,316
If there is, we'll find it.

576
00:28:04,352 --> 00:28:06,254
Mm-hmm.

577
00:28:17,846 --> 00:28:19,246
Hey.

578
00:28:19,282 --> 00:28:21,047
Not you two guys again.

579
00:28:21,085 --> 00:28:23,955
Look, I told you...
we don't have any room.

580
00:28:23,991 --> 00:28:24,959
We're not here to stay.

581
00:28:24,993 --> 00:28:26,461
All we want to do
is to get up on the roof

582
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:27,465
and take a look...

583
00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:28,865
It doesn't matter what you want.

584
00:28:28,901 --> 00:28:29,960
You can't come in.

585
00:28:30,003 --> 00:28:32,235
We got to protect
what's ours around here.

586
00:28:32,275 --> 00:28:33,766
Look, maybe we could
make a deal.

587
00:28:33,811 --> 00:28:35,644
Isn't there something
we could exchange

588
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:38,312
in order to get access
to the roof?

589
00:28:38,354 --> 00:28:40,221
I don't know.

590
00:28:40,258 --> 00:28:41,726
What do you got to offer?

591
00:28:43,831 --> 00:28:45,425
Uh-huh, that's what I thought.

592
00:28:45,468 --> 00:28:47,904
Look, maybe you guys should try
another building.

593
00:28:55,454 --> 00:28:57,424
Hey, uh... wait a minute.

594
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:03,902
Maybe... we can
make a deal after all.

595
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,054
Well, at least now
we look like we belong here.

596
00:29:18,099 --> 00:29:21,664
Yeah, and we smell just as bad
as everyone else, too.

597
00:29:34,031 --> 00:29:35,830
Stay away from him!

598
00:29:35,868 --> 00:29:37,302
Whatever you say.

599
00:29:37,338 --> 00:29:38,898
Just put the knife down.

600
00:29:38,941 --> 00:29:40,877
Step into the light,
so I can see you.

601
00:29:42,749 --> 00:29:44,183
We're new here.

602
00:29:44,218 --> 00:29:46,415
We're just trying
to get to the roof.

603
00:29:46,456 --> 00:29:48,358
Get a better look at the place.

604
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,700
Believe me, it doesn't look
any better from up there.

605
00:29:52,735 --> 00:29:53,725
Dad...

606
00:29:58,781 --> 00:30:01,412
It's going to be okay, Danny.

607
00:30:01,453 --> 00:30:03,082
What happened?

608
00:30:03,122 --> 00:30:06,026
He was beaten up by some ghosts.

609
00:30:06,062 --> 00:30:08,123
My wife went to get help,
but there's only one doctor

610
00:30:08,166 --> 00:30:09,429
on duty
at the Processing Center.

611
00:30:09,469 --> 00:30:11,439
Well, why don't you
let me take a look?

612
00:30:11,473 --> 00:30:12,771
I know a little bit
about medicine.

613
00:30:12,809 --> 00:30:14,072
Julian...

614
00:30:14,111 --> 00:30:16,343
It can't hurt to just look.

615
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,361
Hey.

616
00:30:25,401 --> 00:30:28,805
I'm just going to take
a quick look here, okay?

617
00:30:35,988 --> 00:30:37,617
Does that hurt?

618
00:30:42,067 --> 00:30:43,900
Here?

619
00:30:43,937 --> 00:30:46,271
Well, looks like
you've been lucky.

620
00:30:46,308 --> 00:30:49,941
No broken ribs, and these cuts
are mostly superficial.

621
00:30:49,983 --> 00:30:51,451
You're going to be okay.

622
00:30:51,486 --> 00:30:52,920
You're going to need
some clean rags

623
00:30:52,955 --> 00:30:55,187
and something
to disinfect these wounds.

624
00:30:55,226 --> 00:30:56,524
Alcohol should do.

625
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,465
I think I can get some.

626
00:30:59,769 --> 00:31:01,500
Okay.

627
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,703
Here we go.

628
00:31:07,485 --> 00:31:09,978
Looks like we made a new friend.

629
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:15,462
Hey!

630
00:31:15,501 --> 00:31:17,801
You know, the district
could use another doctor.

631
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:19,832
I don't really
practice anymore.

632
00:31:19,876 --> 00:31:22,312
But there are people here
who need you.

633
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:24,544
I'm sorry, but they'll have
to get along without me.

634
00:31:26,389 --> 00:31:28,484
You two are new here

635
00:31:28,527 --> 00:31:30,292
so let me explain
something to you.

636
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:33,131
You can forget about getting
out of here anytime soon.

637
00:31:33,169 --> 00:31:35,139
This is your home now.

638
00:31:35,173 --> 00:31:37,006
The only help we're going
to get is from each other

639
00:31:37,043 --> 00:31:38,443
and if we don't start
pulling together

640
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,812
we're finished.

641
00:31:39,849 --> 00:31:41,546
All we want
is to be left alone.

642
00:31:41,586 --> 00:31:43,020
My mistake.

643
00:31:43,055 --> 00:31:45,491
I thought you wanted
to get out of here.

644
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:46,291
We do.

645
00:31:46,328 --> 00:31:47,387
Well, the only way

646
00:31:47,431 --> 00:31:49,560
that's going to happen
is if we get organized,

647
00:31:49,602 --> 00:31:52,335
and let people on the outside
know what's going on in here.

648
00:31:52,374 --> 00:31:53,672
Do whatever you want.

649
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,270
Just leave us out of it.

650
00:31:56,783 --> 00:31:59,983
If you want to be left alone...

651
00:32:00,023 --> 00:32:02,084
that's fine with me.

652
00:32:02,127 --> 00:32:04,860
But if you want to help us

653
00:32:04,899 --> 00:32:07,700
and help yourselves

654
00:32:07,738 --> 00:32:10,106
you know where to find me.

655
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:19,317
Our sea floor mining project

656
00:32:19,361 --> 00:32:21,854
is almost ready
to go into operation.

657
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,097
Now, the Pan-Caribbean
government did have

658
00:32:24,137 --> 00:32:30,514
some misgivings, but I
think we've won them over.

659
00:32:30,551 --> 00:32:34,423
I hear you just came
back from Christchurch.

660
00:32:34,459 --> 00:32:36,725
Yes. Did a little
skiing on Mount Cook.

661
00:32:36,763 --> 00:32:37,890
You're lucky.

662
00:32:37,932 --> 00:32:39,731
We had to cancel our trip
to the Alps this year

663
00:32:39,769 --> 00:32:41,762
because of the student
protests in France.

664
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,274
I thought the Neo-Trotskyists

665
00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:45,006
were going to put
a stop to that.

666
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,275
They're not having
any more luck

667
00:32:46,315 --> 00:32:47,442
than the Gaullists did.

668
00:32:47,485 --> 00:32:50,457
Europe is falling apart.

669
00:32:50,491 --> 00:32:51,982
Well, at least
we don't have to worry

670
00:32:52,027 --> 00:32:53,290
about that kind of thing here.

671
00:32:55,066 --> 00:32:56,797
Don't count on it.

672
00:32:58,406 --> 00:33:00,899
You'll have to excuse
Jadzia's cynicism.

673
00:33:00,944 --> 00:33:02,846
She was just mugged yesterday.

674
00:33:02,882 --> 00:33:05,410
That kind of thing's bound
to give a negative impression

675
00:33:05,453 --> 00:33:06,648
of the future.

676
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:08,683
So... who mugged you?

677
00:33:08,727 --> 00:33:10,390
Did you see them?

678
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:12,923
It doesn't really matter.

679
00:33:12,968 --> 00:33:15,769
I'm just glad
that I wasn't hurt.

680
00:33:15,841 --> 00:33:17,868
Well, whoever it was
did a very thorough job.

681
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:20,246
They took everything
she had, even her I.D.

682
00:33:20,283 --> 00:33:21,581
Chris rescued me

683
00:33:21,619 --> 00:33:24,352
and let me use his computer
to get my replacement I.D.

684
00:33:24,391 --> 00:33:27,727
You were lucky the police
didn't find you first.

685
00:33:27,765 --> 00:33:30,669
If they'd caught you
on the street without I.D.

686
00:33:30,704 --> 00:33:33,676
You might have ended up
in a Sanctuary District.

687
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:35,270
I thought they
stopped doing that.

688
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:36,372
Why would they?

689
00:33:36,415 --> 00:33:39,114
It's the only way
to keep those people

690
00:33:39,154 --> 00:33:41,351
off the streets.

691
00:33:41,392 --> 00:33:43,385
Excuse us a minute.

692
00:33:46,669 --> 00:33:47,967
Is that true?

693
00:33:48,005 --> 00:33:49,303
Is what true?

694
00:33:49,341 --> 00:33:53,406
About taking people without I.D.
To a Sanctuary District.

695
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:54,747
Yes, it is. Why?

696
00:33:54,786 --> 00:33:56,619
I still haven't
found my friends.

697
00:33:56,656 --> 00:33:58,853
And you think they might be
in a Sanctuary District?

698
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,121
It's possible.

699
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:03,067
If you hadn't found me,
I might have wound up in one.

700
00:34:03,102 --> 00:34:05,042
Can we check and see
if they're inside?

701
00:34:05,175 --> 00:34:06,701
Well, it might take some doing.

702
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:10,344
The Sanctuary District records
are not posted on the Net.

703
00:34:12,156 --> 00:34:15,492
But I might be able
to pull in some favors.

704
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,645
And I thought the lines
at the Replimat were bad.

705
00:34:28,288 --> 00:34:31,158
By the time we get dinner,
it'll be time for breakfast.

706
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,995
You'd think that before
they locked thousands of people

707
00:34:34,033 --> 00:34:36,561
into a 20-square-block area,
they'd give some thought

708
00:34:36,605 --> 00:34:38,768
as to how those people
were going to get fed.

709
00:34:38,809 --> 00:34:42,213
I'm going to see how much longer
this is going to take.

710
00:34:44,655 --> 00:34:46,989
Hey, Gimme!

711
00:34:47,026 --> 00:34:49,519
I'm talking to you.

712
00:34:49,564 --> 00:34:51,329
Let me see your food card.

713
00:34:51,367 --> 00:34:52,858
What for?

714
00:34:55,342 --> 00:34:57,141
Because I said so.

715
00:34:57,179 --> 00:34:58,238
Let him go!

716
00:35:01,354 --> 00:35:02,583
What?

717
00:35:02,624 --> 00:35:05,528
I said let him go!

718
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:06,996
Oh.

719
00:35:07,032 --> 00:35:09,799
Well, when you
put it like that...

720
00:35:35,055 --> 00:35:36,752
Leave them alone!

721
00:35:41,501 --> 00:35:42,833
Are you all right?

722
00:35:50,452 --> 00:35:51,852
Get his card!

723
00:35:51,889 --> 00:35:53,323
Get his food card!

724
00:35:55,963 --> 00:35:58,024
Come on, let's get out of here!

725
00:35:58,068 --> 00:35:59,935
Come on. Let's go!

726
00:36:02,109 --> 00:36:03,202
Help him!

727
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,576
He never would
have gotten hurt

728
00:36:04,613 --> 00:36:05,911
if it wasn't for us.

729
00:36:08,756 --> 00:36:11,090
Breathe, damn you, breathe!

730
00:36:12,764 --> 00:36:14,027
God, he's gone.

731
00:36:15,435 --> 00:36:17,871
Come on.
We've got to get out of here!

732
00:36:35,308 --> 00:36:36,799
Cover!

733
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:55,412
They're gone.

734
00:36:55,449 --> 00:36:58,649
For now, but they're
the least of our worries.

735
00:36:58,688 --> 00:37:02,458
That man who just got killed
trying to help us...

736
00:37:02,529 --> 00:37:05,933
that man was Gabriel Bell.

737
00:37:07,005 --> 00:37:08,405
Oh...

738
00:37:13,451 --> 00:37:15,819
If only I'd had my medkit

739
00:37:15,857 --> 00:37:18,020
or even if I'd got him
to a hospital

740
00:37:18,061 --> 00:37:20,624
I might have been able
to save him.

741
00:37:20,665 --> 00:37:22,498
You did all you could, Doctor.

742
00:37:22,569 --> 00:37:24,801
But it wasn't enough, was it?

743
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:28,844
A good man died because of us.

744
00:37:28,883 --> 00:37:30,112
And what about the hostages?

745
00:37:30,151 --> 00:37:32,644
What's going to happen
to them?

746
00:37:32,689 --> 00:37:35,159
Without Bell,
there's a good chance

747
00:37:35,195 --> 00:37:37,529
those hostages are going to die.

748
00:37:37,566 --> 00:37:39,229
And if that happens

749
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:42,572
how is it going to affect
the future?

750
00:37:44,981 --> 00:37:46,712
We have to save them.

751
00:37:46,751 --> 00:37:48,482
Whatever it takes

752
00:37:48,521 --> 00:37:51,687
we have to make sure
those hostages survive.

753
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:00,311
All right, Chief.

754
00:38:00,345 --> 00:38:01,677
Let's get over
to the transporter room

755
00:38:01,714 --> 00:38:02,682
before we change our minds.

756
00:38:02,716 --> 00:38:04,116
Too late, Major.

757
00:38:04,153 --> 00:38:06,716
Looks like Starfleet's
changed our minds for us.

758
00:38:06,757 --> 00:38:08,989
Headquarters thinks
our plan's too risky.

759
00:38:09,029 --> 00:38:11,261
They're afraid
that while we're searching

760
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,632
for Sisko and the others

761
00:38:12,669 --> 00:38:14,502
we may contaminate
the timeline.

762
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,838
Get me Admiral Wright.

763
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:18,108
I had a feeling you'd say that.

764
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:20,846
That's odd.

765
00:38:20,886 --> 00:38:21,819
What is it?

766
00:38:21,855 --> 00:38:25,350
I'm not getting any response
from Starfleet.

767
00:38:25,395 --> 00:38:28,026
Is there something wrong
with our communications array?

768
00:38:28,067 --> 00:38:30,003
I was just talking
to Starfleet Security

769
00:38:30,038 --> 00:38:31,336
when my com line went dead.

770
00:38:31,374 --> 00:38:32,934
There's nothing wrong
at our end.

771
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,309
Everything checks out fine.

772
00:38:34,346 --> 00:38:37,011
Could be interference
on the com channels.

773
00:38:37,052 --> 00:38:39,113
Try a wide band subspace signal.

774
00:38:40,525 --> 00:38:42,358
Still nothing.

775
00:38:42,396 --> 00:38:44,025
Maybe if I direct it

776
00:38:44,066 --> 00:38:46,936
toward one of the Federation
communications satellites

777
00:38:46,972 --> 00:38:48,440
in Earth orbit...

778
00:38:51,013 --> 00:38:52,276
What is it, Chief?

779
00:38:52,315 --> 00:38:54,547
They're not there.

780
00:38:54,586 --> 00:38:58,822
The entire
Earth satellite network...

781
00:38:58,862 --> 00:39:00,491
it's gone.

782
00:39:00,532 --> 00:39:02,900
The spacedocks,
the orbital habitats?

783
00:39:02,937 --> 00:39:04,405
All of it!

784
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,433
The Utopia Planitia Yards
on Mars

785
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:08,572
the Terraforming Stations
on Venus

786
00:39:08,614 --> 00:39:10,982
Starfleet Headquarters.

787
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,992
I'm not detecting a single sign
of Starfleet activity

788
00:39:14,026 --> 00:39:15,392
anywhere in this sector.

789
00:39:15,428 --> 00:39:17,591
Try a non-Federation frequency.

790
00:39:17,699 --> 00:39:19,498
The only subspace signals

791
00:39:19,536 --> 00:39:23,031
I'm detecting are from
the vicinity of Alpha Centauri

792
00:39:23,077 --> 00:39:24,706
and they're Romulan.

793
00:39:24,747 --> 00:39:26,307
Well, that's impossible.

794
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:28,445
Do you think Sisko
and the others

795
00:39:28,488 --> 00:39:31,051
might have somehow
altered the timeline?

796
00:39:31,093 --> 00:39:32,322
They must have.

797
00:39:32,362 --> 00:39:34,229
Then why weren't we affected?

798
00:39:34,266 --> 00:39:35,757
I'm not sure.

799
00:39:35,802 --> 00:39:39,970
But maybe...
maybe when it exploded

800
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:43,450
the singularity that polarized
the chroniton particles

801
00:39:43,484 --> 00:39:45,818
created some kind
of subspace bubble

802
00:39:45,855 --> 00:39:47,255
around the ship...

803
00:39:47,292 --> 00:39:50,594
isolated it from the changes
in the timeline.

804
00:39:50,632 --> 00:39:53,433
I'm not sure,
but I'll have to run some tests.

805
00:39:53,471 --> 00:39:55,134
One thing's for certain.

806
00:39:55,175 --> 00:39:59,616
Right now, this ship
is all that's left of Starfleet.

807
00:40:05,161 --> 00:40:07,894
I thought you didn't want
to get involved.

808
00:40:07,934 --> 00:40:10,667
We've changed our minds.

809
00:40:10,705 --> 00:40:12,334
Glad to hear it.

810
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:14,903
We can use
all the help we can get.

811
00:40:14,948 --> 00:40:17,180
This place is about to explode.

812
00:40:17,219 --> 00:40:21,455
Most of us agreed to live here
because they promised us jobs.

813
00:40:21,493 --> 00:40:22,961
I don't know about you

814
00:40:22,997 --> 00:40:25,662
but I haven't been
on any job interviews lately

815
00:40:25,702 --> 00:40:27,569
and neither has anyone else.

816
00:40:27,606 --> 00:40:29,405
They've forgotten about us.

817
00:40:29,443 --> 00:40:30,741
So, what do we do?

818
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,371
We make them remember.

819
00:40:32,415 --> 00:40:33,906
Day after tomorrow

820
00:40:33,952 --> 00:40:37,517
we're going to hold a rally
outside the Processing Center.

821
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:40,725
I want everyone to be there...
gimmes, ghosts

822
00:40:40,765 --> 00:40:42,063
even the dims.

823
00:40:42,102 --> 00:40:44,231
I want to remind
the people outside

824
00:40:44,273 --> 00:40:46,607
that we haven't
done anything wrong

825
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:47,703
that we're not criminals

826
00:40:47,746 --> 00:40:49,579
and that we don't deserve
to live like this.

827
00:40:49,616 --> 00:40:51,711
We'll spread the word.

828
00:40:51,754 --> 00:40:53,917
Good.

829
00:40:53,959 --> 00:40:55,622
One more thing.

830
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:58,361
Tell people
when they come to the rally

831
00:40:58,401 --> 00:41:02,238
to bring their families,
their kids

832
00:41:02,371 --> 00:41:04,739
and try to look their best.

833
00:41:04,776 --> 00:41:09,046
We're not derelicts, no matter
what they say about us.

834
00:41:09,085 --> 00:41:11,385
I could probably use a shave.

835
00:41:11,423 --> 00:41:13,222
Not to mention a bath.

836
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,531
Yes.

837
00:41:19,972 --> 00:41:21,372
Yes, thank you.

838
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,443
You were right.

839
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:27,249
Your friends are
in Sanctuary District "A."

840
00:41:27,288 --> 00:41:29,155
When can we get them out?

841
00:41:29,192 --> 00:41:30,889
Well, it might not be that easy.

842
00:41:30,928 --> 00:41:32,693
The Sanctuary personnel
first have to find them.

843
00:41:32,732 --> 00:41:34,827
There's something
like 10,000 people in there.

844
00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:36,337
Did they say
how long it would take?

845
00:41:36,373 --> 00:41:37,500
They're not sure.

846
00:41:37,541 --> 00:41:39,568
But don't worry,
your friends are fine.

847
00:41:39,612 --> 00:41:41,479
That's the whole point
of the Sanctuary...

848
00:41:41,516 --> 00:41:44,215
to give people in trouble
food and a place to stay.

849
00:41:44,255 --> 00:41:45,348
If that's all it's for

850
00:41:45,424 --> 00:41:47,257
then why is there
a wall around it?

851
00:41:51,035 --> 00:41:52,902
...in two days in front
of the Processing Center.

852
00:41:52,938 --> 00:41:53,906
Will you spread the word?

853
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,135
All Right.

854
00:41:55,177 --> 00:41:56,737
Okay, you got it?
The day after tomorrow.

855
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,148
Try to be there, and tell
everyone else you know.

856
00:42:01,089 --> 00:42:03,321
That's, uh, 500 people
we've talked to today.

857
00:42:03,427 --> 00:42:06,490
That only leaves
about 9,000 to go.

858
00:42:06,533 --> 00:42:08,332
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down!

859
00:42:08,403 --> 00:42:09,496
What's going on?

860
00:42:09,539 --> 00:42:10,734
One of the guards got in a fight

861
00:42:10,774 --> 00:42:12,174
with a dim down,
down at Processing.

862
00:42:12,211 --> 00:42:13,645
Now everyone's going crazy.

863
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,841
I have to find my dad.

864
00:42:43,473 --> 00:42:45,943
Give me that!
Get back!

865
00:42:49,552 --> 00:42:52,080
Get away!
Get away from him!

866
00:42:52,124 --> 00:42:54,185
Come on, we have to get him
off the street!

867
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:10,192
Everybody put your hands
on your head

868
00:43:10,227 --> 00:43:11,320
and face the wall!

869
00:43:11,362 --> 00:43:12,660
You can't do this.

870
00:43:12,698 --> 00:43:16,034
I can do anything I want.

871
00:43:16,071 --> 00:43:17,665
Now...

872
00:43:17,708 --> 00:43:19,405
up against the wall.

873
00:43:19,478 --> 00:43:21,175
That's enough!

874
00:43:24,622 --> 00:43:27,651
Well, look who we've got here.

875
00:43:27,695 --> 00:43:30,929
Way to show initiative, new boy.

876
00:43:32,671 --> 00:43:35,005
Take him,
and throw him back there

877
00:43:35,042 --> 00:43:37,376
along with the rest
of our, uh, guests.

878
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:39,179
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

879
00:43:39,218 --> 00:43:42,554
I think I am making
a political statement.

880
00:43:43,927 --> 00:43:45,453
Maybe if we're lucky

881
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:48,628
I might even be able to stage
a nice little, uh, photo op.

882
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:52,303
I hope that meets
with your approval.

883
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:55,775
Do as he says.

884
00:44:02,096 --> 00:44:03,793
Well, all right!

885
00:44:03,833 --> 00:44:07,294
I've waited a long time
for this!

886
00:44:07,341 --> 00:44:11,076
And I know I won't
be disappointed.

887
00:44:12,284 --> 00:44:13,775
Ain't that right, new boy?

888
00:44:16,359 --> 00:44:18,329
The name is Bell.

889
00:44:19,732 --> 00:44:21,497
Gabriel Bell.
