00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:06,298
SISKO:<i> Commander's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 48481.2.</i>

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,175
<i>My senior staff and I</i>
<i>have been asked</i>

3
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:10,260
<i>to address the annual</i>
<i>Starfleet symposium</i>

4
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:12,429
<i>on the current situation</i>
<i>in the Gamma Quadrant.</i>

5
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:14,598
<i>I'm looking forward</i>
<i>to the opportunity</i>

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,892
<i>and to visiting</i>
<i>my sister in Portland.</i>

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,562
Entering Earth orbit.

8
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:23,565
Now there's something I never
get tired of looking at.

9
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,985
If you ask me, the seas
could be a little more purple.

10
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:28,779
That's funny, I was just
thinking they weren't
green enough.

11
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:30,364
I guess it's true
what they say.

12
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,324
"There is no place
like home."

13
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,242
No matter what color
the water is.

14
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:35,786
We'd better get ready,
Benjamin.

15
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:37,078
Dinner tonight
with Admiral Drazman.

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,413
Oh.

17
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:39,874
Not "Droner" Drazman?

18
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,583
The Commander of the Proxima
Maintenance Yards?

19
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:42,960
BASHIR: You're more than
welcome to come along.

20
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:45,086
The entire senior
staff<i> was</i> invited.

21
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,381
Full dress uniform?
Fine table linens?

22
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,424
A different fork
for every course?

23
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:50,926
Thanks, but
no thanks.

24
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:52,678
That's why I stayed
an enlisted man.

25
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,846
They don't expect me to show up

26
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:55,806
for these formal dinners.

27
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:57,599
Major, Constable,
would you care to join us?

28
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:59,100
No, thank you.

29
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:02,688
I'd say this is strictly
a Starfleet occasion.

30
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,399
Commander, I'm receiving
an incoming emergency message.

31
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,776
- It's from DS9.
- On screen.

32
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:10,863
Commander,
am I glad to see you.

33
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:12,280
KIRA: This better
be good, Quark.

34
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,157
You're on an emergency channel.

35
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,952
I just received a message
from the Grand Nagus.

36
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:20,039
He wants me to remind you
of the critical role he played

37
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,750
in establishing contact
with the Dominion.

38
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,919
SISKO: You can assure the Nagus
I will mention his assistance

39
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,254
prominently in my report
to Starfleet.

40
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,757
There is one more thing,
Commander.

41
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,800
It seems the Nagus' nephew,

42
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,886
Belongo is currently being held

43
00:01:33,928 --> 00:01:37,096
by Starfleet authorities
on Aldebaran III.

44
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:39,767
A slight misunderstanding,
I'm sure.

45
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:43,812
A misunderstanding the Nagus
no doubt wants to be cleared up.

46
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,814
I do owe him a favor.

47
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:47,566
He thinks so, too.

48
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:50,402
And to quote
the 111th Rule of Acquisition...

49
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:54,907
"Treat people in your debt
like family-- exploit them."

50
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:56,825
I have been reading up.

51
00:01:56,867 --> 00:02:00,287
You can tell the Nagus
I will do everything I can

52
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:03,707
but also remind him of the
217th Rule of Acquisition...

53
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:06,043
"You can't free a fish
from water."

54
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:10,756
I'll be sure the Nagus
gets the message.

55
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,139
She's all yours, Major.

56
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,849
Energize,
Mr. O'Brien.

57
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,392
Aye, sir.

58
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,479
(<i> console beeping</i> )

59
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,981
That's strange.

60
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:28,607
What's wrong?

61
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,191
Well, nothing serious.

62
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,610
Just a power fluctuation

63
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,946
in the annular
confinement beam.

64
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,241
Oh, well, that's impossible.

65
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,660
What happened?

66
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,036
Well, I stabilized the beam

67
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:43,080
but according
to our sensors

68
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:45,457
they never materialized
at their destination.

69
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:48,418
They're just... gone.

70
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,590
MAN: Okay, buddy, come on.
Rise and shine.

71
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,550
Come on!

72
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,176
Well, look what
we have here.

73
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,762
Who are you?

74
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:00,722
Who am<i> I?</i>
You believe this?

75
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:03,350
Sleeping Beauty
asking me questions. Up!

76
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,149
Hey, Vin, we've been
working all night.

77
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:12,776
Why don't we forget
about these guys?

78
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,528
I just want to go home

79
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,279
and see Sonya and the kids
and get some sleep.

80
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,948
What are you, an anarchist?

81
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,450
There's a law against
sleeping in the streets.

82
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:23,328
Though I do like
the matching pajamas.

83
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,579
All right.
Let's see some logo.

84
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,832
- Logo?
- VIN: I.D.

85
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,667
Identification.

86
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:29,960
UHC card.

87
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:31,210
Transit pass.

88
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:32,546
Where are we?

89
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,381
What happened
to Starfleet Headquarters?

90
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:37,134
Perfect. Just what we need,
two more dims.

91
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:38,886
Those shotguns, uniforms...

92
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:42,097
there's something
very familiar about this.

93
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,516
Yeah, probably from
the last time you were
in a Sanctuary District.

94
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,643
Sanctuary District?
What year is this?

95
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:49,396
Same year as it was yesterday--
2024.

96
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,314
Let's go.

97
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,737
VIN: How do they find us?

98
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,456
Are you okay?

99
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,916
Oh, my head.

100
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,293
What happened?

101
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:17,878
Did you get
jacked or something?

102
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:18,962
Jacked?

103
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,588
You know, robbed.

104
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,175
Oh...

105
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,886
Did they get your
credit chips, your I.D.?

106
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,637
(sighs)

107
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,890
Oh... it looks like
they got everything

108
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,100
except my brooch.

109
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,477
What...? Do you
live near here, uh?

110
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,146
Can you get home?

111
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:38,065
I was traveling
with some friends

112
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,775
and uh, I guess
we got separated.

113
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:44,403
Well, you shouldn't be
walking around without I.D.

114
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,614
You better order
some replacements.

115
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,659
You can use my Interface
terminal if you wish.

116
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:52,037
My office is just
around the corner.

117
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,039
That's very kind of you... um?

118
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,082
Chris, Chris Brynner.

119
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,208
Jadzia.

120
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,751
That's a pretty name.

121
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,586
What is that, Dutch?

122
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,171
Ah, something like that.

123
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:03,715
It's very kind of you
to help me.

124
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,592
Oh, don't mention it.

125
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:08,469
It's not every day that I get
to rescue a damsel in distress.

126
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,971
Let me help you.

127
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,563
It's just this way.

128
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,826
Check the Heisenberg
compensators.

129
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:35,122
I'll run a level-1 diagnostic
of the pattern buffers.

130
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,082
See if there was any
kind of field imbalance.

131
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,583
Chief?

132
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,419
- Any news from Starfleet?
- Nothing good.

133
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,878
As far as they can tell,
Commander Sisko and the others

134
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,505
never materialized
in San Francisco.

135
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,341
According to
their sensors

136
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,385
our transporter signal
disintegrated

137
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:50,887
immediately after we began
the beam-out sequence.

138
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:53,014
That doesn't agree
with our records.

139
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,474
The system log shows

140
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,393
that the transport
was successfully completed.

141
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:57,602
They definitely
materialized somewhere.

142
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,187
Well, that's
good news, anyway

143
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,815
- but the question is, where?
- Oh, I wish I knew.

144
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,943
Whatever the answer is,
it's not in the log.

145
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,946
The only unusual thing it
recorded was the variance

146
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,323
in the annular
confinement beam.

147
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,615
But you corrected for that.

148
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,451
It was a simple adjustment.

149
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,161
The beam was just reacting
to the accumulation

150
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,996
of chroniton particles
on the ship's hull.

151
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,372
Chroniton particles?

152
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,458
They're emitted
by the cloaking device.

153
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,792
They sometimes become lodged

154
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,502
in the ship's ablative
armor matrix.

155
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,296
But we've used the transporter

156
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,131
many times since the cloaking
device was installed.

157
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:28,425
There's never been
a problem before.

158
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,927
I don't know why
there should be one now.

159
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,637
Wait a minute.

160
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,139
It looks like there was

161
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,849
a surge in temporal energy

162
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,810
seconds before the initiation
of the transporter sequence.

163
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:39,894
Tell me that's a clue.

164
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,771
Oh, it's a clue, all right.

165
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,648
I just don't know
what it means yet.

166
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,080
BASHIR:
How do you feel?

167
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,248
Better.

168
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,541
Me, too.

169
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,126
Probably
transporter shock.

170
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,836
Disorienting, but it
wears off quickly.

171
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,588
I know one thing. We're
definitely in San Francisco.

172
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,673
I caught a glimpse of
the Golden Gate Bridge

173
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:09,757
a few blocks back.

174
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,176
I saw it, too.

175
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,345
Do you know what happened
to our combadges?

176
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,596
They were probably stolen
while we were unconscious.

177
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,058
This is not the Earth
we're used to, Doctor.

178
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,601
That's still at least
a century away.

179
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,021
I wonder what happened to Dax.

180
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,898
She was caught in the
transporter beam with us.

181
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,108
Whatever affected us,
must have affected her, too.

182
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,361
That means she's probably
somewhere nearby.

183
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:33,114
The first chance we get,
we've got to find her.

184
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,699
And then what?

185
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,453
And then, we find a way home.

186
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,372
VIN: All right, let's go.
Bring 'em.

187
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,790
Okay, let's go.
Hurry it up.

188
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,337
- Sonya's going to kill me.
- Eh.

189
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,260
What is this place?

190
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,136
A Sanctuary District.

191
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:58,890
BASHIR: 21st century history
is not one of my strong points.

192
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,434
Too depressing.

193
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,102
It's been a
hobby of mine.

194
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:05,063
They made some
ugly mistakes.

195
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:08,233
But they also paved the way
for a lot of things we now
take for granted.

196
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:12,904
- And I assume this is
one of those mistakes.
- A bad one.

197
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,115
By the early 2020s,
there was a place

198
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,658
like this in every major
city in the United States.

199
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,453
Why are these
people in here?

200
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:20,787
Are they criminals?

201
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,372
No, people with
criminal records

202
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:24,999
weren't allowed in
the Sanctuary Districts.

203
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,709
Then what did they do
to deserve this?

204
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,128
Nothing.

205
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,338
Just people...

206
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,549
without jobs or
places to live.

207
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:35,135
So, they get put in here?

208
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,762
Welcome to the 21st
century, Doctor.

209
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:38,846
VIN: Hold it right there.

210
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,892
You wanna go home, go home.
What do I care?

211
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,478
Thanks, Vin.

212
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,856
Shall we?

213
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:09,628
(knocking)

214
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,255
Hi.

215
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:15,716
Sorry to keep
you waiting.

216
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,760
Were you able
to order a new I.D.?

217
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,971
Just finished.

218
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,598
It took me a while
to convince them

219
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,517
I was who I said I was.

220
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,768
They'll be expressing
a transit pass

221
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,228
and a couple of credit
chips in a few hours.

222
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,522
I asked them to send it here.

223
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,649
- I hope you don't mind.
- No problem.

224
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:34,611
Thanks for letting me use your
terminal and your account.

225
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:40,074
You know, those are...

226
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,494
very unusual.

227
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,412
Oh, you mean my tattoos?

228
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:45,955
It is amazing work.

229
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:47,666
Where did you have them done?
Japan?

230
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,083
How did you guess?

231
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,336
Well, I used
to have one myself.

232
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:52,920
A Maori tribal pattern.

233
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,089
It used to go all
the way down my arm.

234
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,551
I got it in high school,
back in the '90s

235
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,469
just like
everybody else.

236
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:01,346
Of course, I had to have it
removed.

237
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,097
Well, you know how it is.

238
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,309
To get the government contracts
you have to look like

239
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,269
all the rest of the drones.

240
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,813
So I guess that
makes me a sellout.

241
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,024
Not necessarily.

242
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,651
What kind of business do you do?

243
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:15,943
You don't know?

244
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,904
Mm-mm.

245
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:22,825
Well, I guess I'll
have to have a talk

246
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,203
with my public relations people.

247
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,121
I'm Chris Brynner...

248
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:30,417
Brynner Information
Systems.

249
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,877
You know,
Interface operations

250
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,379
Net access, Channel 90.

251
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,298
<i>That</i> Chris Brynner.

252
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,009
(chuckles)

253
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:41,720
So, what do you think?

254
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,680
Does that make me
a sellout or not?

255
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:47,684
Probably, but I won't
hold it against you.

256
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,480
These friends of yours
that you told me about...

257
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,982
is there any way for you
to get ahold of them?

258
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,028
I wish I could.

259
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,870
VIN: Left hand.

260
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,085
Other hand.

261
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,924
Look straight ahead.

262
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,303
Now stand over here.

263
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:32,479
COMPUTER:<i> Welcome to SafeTech's</i>

Yeah, yeah,

00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,327
COMPUTER:

269

No I.D.

No fingerprint record,
no Interface account.

272
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:57,629
It's like you two don't exist.

273
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:00,173
Well, since we don't exist,
why not let us go?

274
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,216
Yeah, well, let's see.

275
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:05,136
You don't have any I.D.,
you don't have any money

276
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,347
and you're both
dressed like clowns.

277
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,432
You figure it out.

278
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,225
Please fill out these forms.

279
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,269
Answer all questions
to the best of your ability.

280
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,689
If you cannot speak English,
an interpreter will be provided.

281
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,856
If you cannot read, questions
will be given to you verbally.

282
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,776
If there's any part of this form
you do not understand

283
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:21,319
ask one of our staff
for assistance.

284
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:25,031
Now, sit down, shut up
and fill out the forms.

285
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:28,368
And if you've got any problems,
don't come to me with them.

286
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,662
Thank you...

287
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,664
very much.

288
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,338
Tell Admiral Ngomo
I appreciate her offer

289
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,006
but I don't want anyone
beaming onto this ship

290
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,550
until we know
what's going on.

291
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,219
If they want to come up
by shuttle, that's fine.

292
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:52,392
Major, I think I know what
happened to Commander
Sisko and the others.

293
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:56,229
The temporal surge we detected
was caused by an explosion

294
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,022
of a microscopic
singularity

295
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,482
passing through
this solar system.

296
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,359
Somehow, the energy emitted

297
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,319
by this singularity
shifted the chroniton

298
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,572
particles in our hull
into a high state

299
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,115
- of temporal polarization.
- Which means what?

300
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,910
Which means the transporter
beam was redirected

301
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,620
as it passed through
the polarized particles.

302
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:14,831
- Redirected where?
- Not where...

303
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:16,290
<i>...when.</i>

304
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:20,294
The beam was redirected
through time, not space.

305
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,004
They arrived in San Francisco,
just like they were supposed to.

306
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,799
But not<i> when</i> they
were supposed to.

307
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:28,511
How much time are we
talking about-- days, weeks?

308
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:31,222
More like centuries.

309
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,075
This is ridiculous.

310
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,911
I mean, we've
been here three hours

311
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,954
and the line has
barely moved at all.

312
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,956
I got one word
for you, pal--

313
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,708
plenty of overtime.

314
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,209
That's three words.

315
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,462
Hey, for a dim,
you're pretty smart.

316
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,130
Now, go back and take a seat.

317
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,509
Oh, boy.

318
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,535
- (sighs)
- (woman shouting, indistinct)

319
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,998
Some of these people
are mentally ill.

320
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,292
They need proper
medical treatment.

321
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,377
I know, but they're
not going to get it.

322
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,796
Not now anyway.

323
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,675
What? What is it?

324
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:52,303
SISKO: That calendar over
there-- it says August 30, 2024.

325
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:53,847
I'm not sure I understand.

326
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:54,722
You ever hear of
the Bell Riots?

327
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,223
Vaguely.

328
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,768
It is one of the most
violent civil disturbances

329
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,104
in American history and
it happened right here,
San Francisco

330
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,648
Sanctuary District "A"

331
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,317
the first week of
September, 2024.

332
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,152
But that's only
a few days from now.

333
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:11,238
Which means if we don't
get out of here soon

334
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,992
we'll be caught right
in the middle of it.

335
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:27,338
Just how bad are these riots
going to be, Commander?

336
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,549
Bad.

337
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,051
The Sanctuary residents
will take over the district.

338
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:34,136
Some of the guards
will be taken hostage.

339
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,890
The government will send
in troops to restore order.

340
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,934
Hundreds of Sanctuary
residents will be killed.

341
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,686
Hundreds?

342
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,899
And there's nothing
we can do to prevent it.

343
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,651
Starfleet temporal
displacement policy

344
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,444
may sound good
in the classroom

345
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:53,031
but to know that hundreds
of people are going to die

346
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,910
and to not be able to do
a thing to save them.

347
00:17:56,951 --> 00:18:01,039
I sympathize, Doctor, but if it
will make you feel any better

348
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,917
the riots will be one
of the watershed events

349
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,626
of the 21st century.

350
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,336
Gabriel Bell will see to that.

351
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:10,172
- Bell?
- The man they named
the riots after.

352
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,299
He is one of the
Sanctuary residents

353
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,468
who will be guarding
the hostages.

354
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,470
The government troops
will storm this place

355
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,765
based on rumors that the
hostages have been killed.

356
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:22,184
It turns out the hostages
were never harmed

357
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,144
because of Gabriel Bell.

358
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:27,899
In the end, Bell sacrifices
his own life to save them.

359
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,317
He'll become a national hero.

360
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:35,197
Outrage over his death and the
death of the other residents

361
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,283
will change public opinion
about the Sanctuaries.

362
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,368
They'll be torn down.

363
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,413
And the United States will
finally begin correcting
the social problems

364
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:45,124
it had struggled with
for over 100 years.

365
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,794
And all of this is going to
happen in the next few days.

366
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,253
Which means...

367
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,171
if we warn these people
about what's coming

368
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,466
if we try to help
them in any way

369
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:56,427
we risk altering a pivotal
moment in history

370
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,764
and we can't let that happen.

371
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:02,266
Hey, I hate to break up your
intimate conversation,

372
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,434
but you're next.

373
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:06,062
<i>(phone ringing)</i>

374
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,078
Is there something wrong?

375
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,289
Well, according to these forms
you're supposed to be dims

376
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,499
but you're not, are you?

377
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,959
I hope you're
not disappointed.

378
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:30,753
Pleasantly surprised
is more like it.

379
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:32,755
I guess I owe you an apology.

380
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:34,507
If I had known you were
gimmes I could've processed

381
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,801
your application much sooner.

382
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,011
Gimmes?

383
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:39,386
They're American
slang terms.

384
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,513
I try not to use them

385
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,598
but it's a bad habit.

386
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,351
Gimmes are people like you,
people who are looking for help.

387
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:46,894
A job, a place to live.

388
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,521
And what about the dims?

389
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,690
Don't they need help?

390
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,232
The dims should be in hospitals

391
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,401
but the government can't
afford to keep them there,

392
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,903
so we get them instead.

393
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:58,781
I hate it, but that's
the way it is.

394
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:02,242
I see here that you both have
just arrived in San Francisco.

395
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,953
Do you have any jobs lined up?

396
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:06,372
No. Um, actually,
we weren't planning

397
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,082
on staying here very long.

398
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,793
Have you got a place to stay,
or anyone who can vouch for you?

399
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:14,421
No, we were traveling with
a friend, but we were separated

400
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,049
right after we arrived.

401
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,176
You have any way of contacting
this friend of yours?

402
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,886
Not at the moment.

403
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,055
Well, in that case

404
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:23,764
I'm afraid you're going
to have to stay here

405
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:26,308
in the Sanctuary
for the time being.

406
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,601
You mean we can't leave?

407
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:28,936
It's for your
own safety.

408
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,146
Really?

409
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:31,772
And it's the law.

410
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:33,149
SISKO: What about jobs?

411
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:35,693
How are we supposed to
find a place to work

412
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:38,278
and somewhere to live
if we're stuck in here?

413
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,365
Well, one of the services
we provide is job placement.

414
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,325
And how long does
that usually take?

415
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:46,412
I wish I could give you
a definite answer

416
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,915
but jobs are hard
to come by right now

417
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,875
what with the
economy and all.

418
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:53,377
My advice is to be patient.

419
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,838
In the meantime, take these.

420
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,132
They're your
ration cards.

421
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,884
You can use them
to get food and water

422
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,844
at any of the distribution
points in the district.

423
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:03,387
Hang onto them.

424
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:06,432
Where are we supposed to stay
while we're here?

425
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,184
Anywhere you like.

426
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:10,603
The buildings in the district
are there for everyone to use.

427
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,774
Thanks for your help.

428
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,358
One more thing.

429
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,818
A little advice.

430
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,820
Stay away from
district security.

431
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:22,073
They've had their
budget cut again.

432
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:24,533
They're overworked
and underpaid.

433
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:27,787
Just give them a lot of space,
and watch out for ghosts.

434
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,914
- Ghosts?
- That's what we call people

435
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:33,000
who haven't integrated well
into the Sanctuary.

436
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,460
They can be dangerous

437
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,378
and they tend to prey
on other residents.

438
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:38,714
Thanks for the warning.

439
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,299
We'll stay away from them.

440
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:46,346
Dax to Sisko.

441
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:49,100
Dax to Bashir.

442
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:51,351
If you can hear me,
please respond.

443
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,357
Okay.

444
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,526
My assistant was
able to get you

445
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:02,529
a room at the Clift
for the next five nights.

446
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,073
You didn't have
to do that.

447
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:06,575
I know that,
but I wanted to.

448
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:09,245
So, uh, what
are your plans?

449
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:11,122
I still have to
find my friends.

450
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:13,040
Well, I hope
you don't mind

451
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:14,917
but I had Britt
do some checking.

452
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:17,003
No one matching their
descriptions has been admitted

453
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,337
to any of the city hospitals

454
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,881
- or trauma wards.
- That's good news.

455
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:24,426
Look, uh, I would like to know
how this turns out.

456
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:28,181
I'm having a little get-together
here tomorrow in the office,

457
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:30,057
and I'd like
you to come--

458
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,642
if you want-- you
and your friends.

459
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:34,228
I'd like that.

460
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:41,861
Well, good luck.

461
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,779
Thanks. I could use it.

462
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,038
Whoa. You guys
can't come in here.

463
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,123
BASHIR: We're just looking
for somewhere to sleep.

464
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:56,209
Well, you're going to
have to look someplace else.

465
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,878
Oh, let me guess--
this building is full.

466
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,171
Sorry.

467
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:04,758
Every building we go to,
it's the same story.

468
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,552
They can't<i> all</i> be full.

469
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:07,887
Don't be so sure.

470
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,680
One of the main complaints

471
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,473
against the Sanctuary Districts
was overcrowding.

472
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,517
It got to the point
where they didn't care

473
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,144
how many people were in here.

474
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:16,896
They just wanted to
keep them out of sight.

475
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:20,440
And once they were out
of sight, what then?

476
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,611
I mean, look at this man.

477
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:28,032
There's no need for him
to live like that.

478
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:29,658
With the right medication

479
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,451
he could lead a full
and normal life.

480
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,995
Maybe in our time.

481
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:34,705
Not just in our time.

482
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,333
There are any number
of effective treatments

483
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:40,127
for schizophrenia,
even in this day and age.

484
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:42,171
They could cure
that man now, today

485
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:43,672
if they gave a damn.

486
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:45,925
It's not that they
don't give a damn,

487
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,968
they've just given up.

488
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:53,391
The social problems they face
seem too enormous to deal with.

489
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:56,018
Well, that only
makes things worse.

490
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,312
Causing people
to suffer

491
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,981
because you hate
them is terrible

492
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:03,317
but causing
people to suffer

493
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,569
because you have
forgotten how to care--

494
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:06,987
(sighs)

495
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:09,407
that's really hard
to understand.

496
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:11,117
They'll remember.

497
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:14,161
It will take some time,
and it won't be easy

498
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:16,872
but eventually,
people in this century

499
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:18,832
<i>will</i> remember how to care.

500
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:23,879
Right, only it makes
you wonder, doesn't it?

501
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:26,966
Are humans really
any different

502
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,969
than Cardassians
or Romulans?

503
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:34,014
If push comes to shove,
if something disastrous

504
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:35,515
happens to the Federation,

505
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:39,019
if we are frightened enough,
or desperate enough,

506
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:42,189
how would we react?

507
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:45,109
Would we stay true
to our ideals

508
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:48,237
or would we
just stay here

509
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:51,531
right back
where we started?

510
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,742
I don't know.

511
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:56,912
But as a Starfleet officer

512
00:24:56,954 --> 00:25:01,292
it's my job to make sure
we never have to find out.

513
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:07,298
(groaning)

514
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:10,426
MAN:
Get his food card.

515
00:25:10,468 --> 00:25:14,096
Remember, Doctor,
we can't interfere.

516
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:16,223
You got a problem?

517
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:17,808
No problem.

518
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,517
MAN: You look upset.

519
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,021
If we've done anything
to offend you

520
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:25,316
please let us know, so that we
can be sure not to do it again.

521
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:26,524
Don't worry about us.

522
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,068
- We're new here.
- Really?

523
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,654
- I never would have guessed.
- (gang chuckles)

524
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,490
But let me be the first

525
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,949
to welcome you.

526
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:36,410
Would you like
a piece of this?

527
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,037
No, thanks.

528
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,748
Gimmes...

529
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,834
no sense of fun.

530
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:47,046
We're just looking
for a place to sleep.

531
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:51,133
Well, in that case...

532
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:54,053
you better look
somewhere else...

533
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,804
new boy.

534
00:25:58,307 --> 00:25:59,766
You heard what he said.

535
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,310
Let's go.

536
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,482
Enjoy your stay!

537
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:08,317
And in a few days

538
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:11,111
I know you're going
to feel right at home.

539
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,698
Bye!

540
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:28,879
So, in theory, we should be able
to travel into the past

541
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,756
by focusing
the transporter beam

542
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:34,301
through the polarized
chroniton particles.

543
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:36,136
The problem is,
we don't know

544
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:37,555
<i>where</i> in time Sisko
and the others are.

545
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:38,805
I've narrowed it down

546
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,682
to a dozen different
possibilities,

547
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,102
but we only have enough
polarized chronitons

548
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,811
to make five or six attempts.

549
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:47,273
Then we'll have
to take our chances.

550
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,442
Pick the most
likely time periods

551
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:51,277
and send a team down with
tricorders to find them.

552
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,320
The hard part will be to find

553
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:55,906
a couple of volunteers
crazy enough to risk

554
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,991
getting lost in time
to do the job.

555
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,952
I think I know a few
likely candidates.

556
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:08,752
(scattered indistinct
conversations)

557
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:22,057
Here you go, Julian.

558
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:24,977
Oh... oh...

559
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,938
(coughs)

560
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,149
Oh...

561
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,484
If we ever get home

562
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:33,860
I promise never to complain

563
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:37,573
about the station's
Cardassian beds ever again.

564
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:39,825
(both chuckle)

565
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,827
Oh, where
is everybody?

566
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,703
In the food lines,
waiting for breakfast.

567
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:46,332
It's not much to look at

568
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:47,874
but it's better than nothing.

569
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,376
Uh, I'm sorry.

570
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:51,878
They ran out of utensils...
and napkins.

571
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,131
Why am I not surprised?

572
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,924
When you're finished eating,

573
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:57,968
I think we should get up on the
roof of one of these buildings.

574
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,595
I want to get a better
look at the place.

575
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:01,514
Do you think there's
a way out of here?

576
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:04,433
If there is, we'll find it.

577
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:06,435
Mm-hmm.

578
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,448
Hey.

579
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,159
MAN: Not you two
guys again.

580
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,952
Look, I told you,
we don't have any room.

581
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:26,163
We're not here to stay.
All we want to do is

582
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,624
- to get up on the roof and--
- It doesn't matter what
you want.

583
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:30,042
You can't come in.

584
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,336
We got to protect
what's ours around here.

585
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:34,463
Look, maybe we could
make a deal.

586
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:38,384
Isn't there something we could
exchange in order to get access
to the roof?

587
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,219
I don't know.

588
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,928
What do you got
to offer?

589
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:45,474
Uh-huh, that's
what I thought.

590
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:47,934
Look, maybe you guys should
try another building.

591
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:54,441
(whispers inaudibly)

592
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:57,194
Hey, uh... wait a minute.

593
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:03,992
Maybe... we can
make a deal after all.

594
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:11,833
(door shuts)

595
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:18,090
SISKO: Well, at least now
we look like we belong here.

596
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:21,218
BASHIR: Yeah, and we smell just
as bad as everyone else, too.

597
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:28,267
(moans)

598
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:35,857
Stay away from him!

599
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,401
Whatever you say.

600
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:38,985
Just put the
knife down.

601
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,862
Step into the light,
so I can see you.

602
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:45,033
We're new here.

603
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:46,993
We're just trying
to get to the roof.

604
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,328
Get a better look
at the place.

605
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,750
Believe me, it doesn't look
any better from up there.

606
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:53,751
Dad...

607
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,168
(moans)

608
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:01,467
It's going to
be okay, Danny.

609
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,051
What happened?

610
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:06,012
He was beaten up
by some ghosts.

611
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,223
My wife went to get help, but
there's only one doctor on duty

612
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:09,600
at the Processing Center.

613
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:11,226
Well, why don't you
let me take a look?

614
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:13,019
I know a little
bit about medicine.

615
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,354
Julian...

616
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:16,523
It can't hurt
to just look.

617
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,407
Hey.

618
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:29,035
I'm just going to take
a quick look here, okay?

619
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,711
Does that hurt?

620
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:42,048
(inhales sharply)

621
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,801
BASHIR: Here?

622
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,261
Well, looks like
you've been lucky.

623
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:49,931
No broken ribs, and these
cuts are mostly superficial.

624
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,433
You're going to be okay.

625
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:54,144
You're going to need
some clean rags

626
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:55,228
and something to
disinfect these wounds.

627
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,522
Alcohol should do.

628
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,524
I think I can get some.

629
00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:01,568
Okay.

630
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,903
Here we go.

631
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:09,993
Looks like we
made a new friend.

632
00:31:13,831 --> 00:31:15,666
FATHER: Hey!

633
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:17,710
You know, the district
could use another doctor.

634
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:19,670
I don't really
practice anymore.

635
00:31:19,712 --> 00:31:21,421
But there are people
here who need you.

636
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:24,383
I'm sorry, but they'll have
to get along without me.

637
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:28,512
You two are new here

638
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:30,472
so let me explain
something to you.

639
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:33,058
You can forget about getting
out of here anytime soon.

640
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:35,018
This is your home now.

641
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,770
The only help we're going
to get is from each other

642
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,313
and if we don't start
pulling together

643
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:39,523
we're finished.

644
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:41,483
All we want is
to be left alone.

645
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:43,109
My mistake.

646
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,404
I thought you wanted
to get out of here.

647
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:46,488
We do.

648
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,114
Well, the only way

649
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,033
that's going to happen
is if we get organized,

650
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:52,536
and let people on the outside
know what's going on in here.

651
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:53,620
Do whatever you want.

652
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,038
Just leave us out of it.

653
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,375
If you want to be left alone...

654
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:02,796
that's fine with me.

655
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:04,798
But if you want to help us

656
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,634
and help yourselves

657
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:08,844
you know where to find me.

658
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,271
MAN: Our sea floor
mining project

659
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:22,190
is almost ready
to go into operation.

660
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:24,317
Now, the Pan-Caribbean
government did have

661
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:30,866
some misgivings, but I
think we've won them over.

662
00:32:30,908 --> 00:32:34,286
I hear you just came
back from Christchurch.

663
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:36,246
Yes. Did a little
skiing on Mount Cook.

664
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:39,666
You're lucky. We had to cancel
our trip to the Alps this year

665
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,752
because of the student
protests in France.

666
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:44,797
I thought the Neo-Trotskyists
were going to put a stop
to that.

667
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:47,633
They're not having any more
luck than the Gaullists did.

668
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,135
Europe is falling apart.

669
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:53,096
Well, at least we don't
have to worry about that
kind of thing here.

670
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:56,391
Don't count on it.

671
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,813
You'll have to excuse
Jadzia's cynicism.

672
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:02,564
She was just mugged yesterday.

673
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:05,275
That kind of thing's bound
to give a negative impression

674
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,485
of the future.

675
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,570
So... who mugged you?

676
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:10,238
Did you see them?

677
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,532
It doesn't really matter.

678
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:15,619
I'm just glad that
I wasn't hurt.

679
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:17,579
Well, whoever it was
did a very thorough job.

680
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:19,998
They took everything
she had, even her I.D.

681
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:22,751
Chris rescued me and
let me use his computer

682
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:24,336
to get my replacement I.D.

683
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:27,130
You were lucky the police
didn't find you first.

684
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:29,967
If they'd caught you
on the street without I.D.

685
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:33,386
you might have ended up
in a Sanctuary District.

686
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,721
WOMAN: I thought they
stopped doing that.

687
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:36,055
MAN: Why would they?

688
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,976
It's the only way
to keep those people

689
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,936
off the streets.

690
00:33:40,978 --> 00:33:43,021
Excuse us a minute.

691
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:49,778
- Is that true?
- Is what true?

692
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:53,281
About taking people without
I.D. to a Sanctuary District.

693
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:55,325
Yes, it is. Why?

694
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:57,243
I still haven't
found my friends.

695
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,120
And you think they might be
in a Sanctuary District?

696
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,873
It's possible.

697
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:03,375
If you hadn't found me,
I might have wound up in one.

698
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,293
Can we check and see
if they're inside?

699
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:07,629
Well, it might
take some doing.

700
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:10,716
The Sanctuary District records
are not posted on the Net.

701
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:15,094
<i>But</i> I might be able
to pull in some favors.

702
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,481
And I thought the lines
at the Replimat were bad.

703
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:28,358
(chuckles)

704
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,443
By the time we get dinner,
it'll be time for breakfast.

705
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:34,197
You'd think that before they
locked thousands of people

706
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,700
into a 20-square-block area,
they'd give some thought

707
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:38,827
as to how those people
were going to get fed.

708
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:41,872
I'm going to see how much
longer this is going to take.

709
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,168
Hey, Gimme!

710
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,629
I'm talking to you.

711
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:51,673
Let me see
your food card.

712
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:53,132
What for?

713
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:57,387
Because I said so.

714
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:58,638
Let him go!

715
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:02,768
What?

716
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,771
I said let him go!

717
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,313
Oh.

718
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,983
Well, when you
put it like that...

719
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,881
(clattering)

720
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,052
Leave them alone!

721
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,141
Are you all right?

722
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,814
(groaning)

723
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:51,733
Get his card!

724
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:53,026
Get his food card!

725
00:35:56,113 --> 00:35:58,156
Come on, let's get out of here!

726
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,741
Come on. Let's go!

727
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:03,662
Help him!

728
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,371
He never would have gotten
hurt if it wasn't for us.

729
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,419
Breathe, damn you,
breathe!

730
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,213
God, he's gone.

731
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,757
(alarm blares)

732
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:18,135
Come on. We've got
to get out of here!

733
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,029
Cover!

734
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:55,588
They're gone.

735
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,758
For now, but they're
the least of our worries.

736
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,637
That man who just got
killed trying to help us--

737
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:06,391
that man was
Gabriel Bell.

738
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:08,852
Oh...

739
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,109
If only I'd had my medkit,

740
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:18,403
or even if I'd got
him to a hospital

741
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:20,822
I might have been
able to save him.

742
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:22,741
You did all you
could, Doctor.

743
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,784
But it wasn't
enough, was it?

744
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:29,164
A good man died because of us.

745
00:37:29,206 --> 00:37:30,498
And what about the hostages?

746
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,875
What's going to happen to them?

747
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:35,587
Without Bell,
there's a good chance

748
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,589
those hostages are going to die.

749
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,716
And if that happens?

750
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:42,510
How is it going to affect
the future?

751
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:46,765
We have to save them.

752
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,433
Whatever it takes,

753
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:51,436
we have to make sure
those hostages survive.

754
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,565
(sighs)

755
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:00,987
All right, Chief.

756
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:02,614
Let's get over to
the transporter room
before we change our minds.

757
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,282
Too late, Major.

758
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:06,618
Looks like Starfleet's
changed our minds for us.

759
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:09,621
Headquarters thinks
our plan's too risky.

760
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,289
They're afraid that
while we're searching

761
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,582
for Sisko and the others

762
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:14,375
we may contaminate
the timeline.

763
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,877
Get me Admiral Wright.

764
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:18,088
I had a feeling you'd say that.

765
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,758
- That's odd.
- What is it?

766
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,094
I'm not getting any
response from Starfleet.

767
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:28,056
Is there something wrong
with our communications array?

768
00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:30,100
I was just talking
to Starfleet Security

769
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:31,643
when my comm line went dead.

770
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,019
There's nothing
wrong at our end.

771
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:35,272
Everything
checks out fine.

772
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,107
Could be interference
on the comm channels.

773
00:38:37,149 --> 00:38:39,192
Try a wide band
subspace signal.

774
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,279
Still nothing.

775
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,323
Maybe if I direct it toward
one of the Federation

776
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:47,659
communications satellites
in Earth orbit...

777
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:52,247
What is it, Chief?

778
00:38:52,289 --> 00:38:54,874
They're not there.

779
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:58,586
The entire Earth
satellite network...

780
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:00,297
it's gone.

781
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:04,301
- The spacedocks,
the orbital habitats?
- All of it!

782
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,970
The Utopia Planitia
Yards on Mars,

783
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:09,097
the Terraforming
Stations on Venus,

784
00:39:09,139 --> 00:39:10,932
Starfleet
Headquarters.

785
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:14,019
I'm not detecting a single sign
of Starfleet activity

786
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,270
anywhere in this sector.

787
00:39:15,312 --> 00:39:17,730
Try a non-Federation
frequency.

788
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,316
The only subspace signals

789
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:22,861
I'm detecting are from
the vicinity of Alpha Centauri

790
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,654
and they're Romulan.

791
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:26,323
Well, that's impossible.

792
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,449
Do you think Sisko
and the others

793
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:31,036
might have somehow
altered the timeline?

794
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,370
They must've.

795
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:34,122
Then why weren't
we affected?

796
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:35,790
I'm not sure.

797
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:39,878
But maybe...
maybe when it exploded

798
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:43,464
the singularity that polarized
the chroniton particles

799
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,800
created some kind
of subspace bubble

800
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:47,302
around the ship--

801
00:39:47,344 --> 00:39:50,347
isolated it from the
changes in the timeline.

802
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,266
I'm not sure,
but I'll have to run some tests.

803
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:55,935
One thing's
for certain.

804
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:59,605
Right now, this ship
is all that's left of Starfleet.

805
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:07,697
I thought you didn't want
to get involved.

806
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:10,533
We've changed
our minds.

807
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:12,202
Glad to hear it.

808
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:14,787
We can use all
the help we can get.

809
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,082
This place is about to explode.

810
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:19,292
Most of us agreed to live here

811
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:21,169
because they
promised us jobs.

812
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:22,837
I don't know about you,

813
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:25,464
but I haven't been on
any job interviews lately

814
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,425
and neither has anyone else.

815
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:29,302
They've forgotten about us.

816
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:30,553
So, what do we do?

817
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,264
We make them
remember.

818
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:34,015
Day after tomorrow

819
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:37,352
we're going to hold a rally
outside the Processing Center.

820
00:40:37,394 --> 00:40:40,605
I want everyone to be there--
gimmes, ghosts,

821
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:41,898
even the dims.

822
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,983
I want to remind
the people outside

823
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:45,985
that we haven't
done anything wrong

824
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:47,737
that we're not criminals

825
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,406
and that we don't deserve
to live like this.

826
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,449
We'll spread the word.

827
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,618
Good.

828
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,370
One more thing.

829
00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:58,206
Tell people when they
come to the rally

830
00:40:58,248 --> 00:40:59,916
to bring their families,

831
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,460
their kids,

832
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:05,004
and try to look their best.

833
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:06,589
We're not derelicts

834
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:09,384
no matter what they say
about us.

835
00:41:09,426 --> 00:41:11,719
I could probably use a shave.

836
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:13,679
Not to mention a bath.

837
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:18,893
Yes.

838
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:21,771
Yes, thank you.

839
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:24,941
You were right.

840
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:27,568
Your friends are in
Sanctuary District "A."

841
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,446
When can we get them out?

842
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,197
Well, it might
not be that easy.

843
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:33,241
The Sanctuary personnel
first have to find them.

844
00:41:33,283 --> 00:41:35,201
And there's something like
10,000 people in there.

845
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:37,662
- Did they say how
long it would take?
- They're not sure.

846
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:39,372
But don't worry,
your friends are fine.

847
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:41,082
That's the whole point
of the Sanctuary--

848
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:44,002
to give people in trouble
food and a place to stay.

849
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,462
If that's all it's for

850
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,172
then why is there
a wall around it?

851
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:52,969
BASHIR: ...in two days, in
front of the Processing Center.

852
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,720
- Will you spread the word?
- MEN: All Right.

853
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,389
SISKO: Okay, you got it?
The day after tomorrow.

854
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:59,600
Try to be there, and tell
everyone else you know.

855
00:42:01,353 --> 00:42:03,396
That's, uh, 500 people
we've talked to today.

856
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:06,732
That only leaves
about 9,000 to go.

857
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,567
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down!

858
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:09,902
What's going on?

859
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,154
One of the guards
got in a fight

860
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:12,655
with a dim down,
down at Processing.

861
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:13,990
Now everyone's going crazy.

862
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:15,200
I have to find my dad.

863
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:16,617
(explosion)

864
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,244
(people yelling)

865
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:22,374
(alarm blaring)

866
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:29,881
(crowd shouting)

867
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:41,142
(grunting)

868
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:46,356
Give me that!
Get back!

869
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,692
(gunshot)

870
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:52,237
Get away!
Get away from him!

871
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:54,655
Come on, we have to get
him off the street!

872
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,461
(crowd yelling)

873
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:10,255
Everybody put your hands
on your head

874
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:11,423
and face the wall!

875
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:12,882
You can't do this.

876
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:16,219
I can do anything I want.

877
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:17,887
Now...

878
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:19,638
up against
the wall.

879
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,391
That's enough!

880
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:28,314
Well, look who we've got here.

881
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:31,150
Way to show initiative, new boy.

882
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:34,320
Take him, and throw
him back there

883
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:37,449
along with the rest
of our, uh, guests.

884
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:39,200
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

885
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:42,620
I<i> think</i> I am making
a political statement.

886
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:46,249
Maybe if we're lucky I might
even be able to

887
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:48,960
stage a nice little,
uh, photo op.

888
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,295
I hope that meets

889
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:51,712
with your approval.

890
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:56,050
Do as he says.

891
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:03,933
Well, all right!

892
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:08,605
I've waited a long time
for this!

893
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:12,400
And I know I won't
be disappointed.

894
00:44:12,442 --> 00:44:14,026
Ain't that right, new boy?

895
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:18,531
The name is Bell.

896
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:21,493
Gabriel Bell.
