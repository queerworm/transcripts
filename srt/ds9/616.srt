1
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:12,554
Sell at 20.

2
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:14,097
Is that a joke?

3
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,224
Do I look like I'm joking?

4
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:18,268
Evade.

5
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:23,356
She has him.

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,817
-She's down 50 strips.
-Not for long.

7
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:28,028
What makes you so sure?

8
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:31,239
Well, Jadzia's playing a very deep game.

9
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:34,034
Her strategy will become
apparent any moment now.

10
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,452
I see.

11
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:40,790
You have absolutely no idea
how this game is played, do you?

12
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,169
-No.
-( chuckles )

13
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:46,796
But I have developed
a new appreciation for it.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,966
-Oh? Since when?
-Since I married a Tongo player.

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,635
But one thing I am certain about--

16
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,096
She will defeat the Ferengi bartender.

17
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,849
I don't know about that.
Quark's on a roll.

18
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:01,811
In the last month,
he's won 206 straight games.

19
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,357
Would you care to make
a wager on the outcome?

20
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:09,194
Oh, I wouldn't want to bet
against a man's wife.

21
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:12,155
-Well, if you are afraid--
-Name your stakes.

22
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:16,451
One bottle of bloodwine
against one bottle of scotch whiskey.

23
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:17,702
Done.

24
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,499
A sale at 50 and a purchase at 100.

25
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:28,588
Pretty big talk for
a lady who's lost 50 strips.

26
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,757
Are you afraid I can't cover my bets?

27
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,966
Perish the thought!

28
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:35,094
I just hate to kick
somebody when they're down.

29
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:38,848
I'll buy at 100... and confront.

30
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,894
Well, if you're gonna kick me,
I'm gonna have to kick back.

31
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,312
QUARK: unbelievable.

32
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,980
( exclaims in native langauge )

33
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,401
I like my bloodwine
very young and very sweet.

34
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,030
-Is he a friend of yours?
-Just a fan.

35
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:57,575
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to disappoint all your fans.

36
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,579
A full consortium?

37
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,581
207.

38
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,876
A single malt,
preferably something from the highlands.

39
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,962
I will need some time.

40
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,463
Oh, your credit's good.

41
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,636
Whoo, 207 straight.

42
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,556
QUARK: 36 strips of gold press latinum.

43
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,519
-Did you lose a bet?
-It is of no consequence.

44
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,521
I'm sorry about that.

45
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:33,611
I would rather lose a bet on you
than win on someone else.

46
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:36,072
Ooh, good response.

47
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,332
Are you still running
that drill tomorrow afternoon?

48
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,001
I was planning to. Why?

49
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,670
Because I wanted to recalibrate
the external sensors

50
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:53,673
before the night watch comes on duty.

51
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:56,718
We should be done by 1600 hours.

52
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,595
Well, I think that'll work.

53
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:04,392
Oh, the <i>Sutherland </i>is going to
be here the day after tomorrow and...

54
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,286
-You were saying?
-Nothing.

55
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,793
I don't feel like talking anymore.

56
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,274
-( beep )
<i>-Kira to Worf.</i>

57
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,451
Worf here.

58
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:06,204
KIRA:<i> Sorry to bother you, Commander,</i>
<i>but I need to see you and Jadzia</i>

59
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,373
<i>in the Captain's office, immediately.</i>

60
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,999
We're on our way.

61
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:20,134
Jadzia... Get up.

62
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,594
I'm coming!

63
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:23,763
Hey!

64
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,724
We don't have a lot of time,
so I'll get right to it.

65
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,351
For the last two months,

66
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,104
Starfleet has been receiving
military intelligence

67
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,772
from a Cardassian operative.

68
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:35,149
That operative has now sent
an emergency signal

69
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:39,153
indicating he needs to speak to someone
in a face-to-face conversation.

70
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,488
In 13 hours,

71
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,907
he'll beam an encrypted
subspace transmission

72
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,243
to these coordinates in the badlands.

73
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,953
Who is the operative?

74
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,747
Intelligence told me that
his name is Lasaran,

75
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,791
But that's all they'll say about him.

76
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:55,670
They did emphasize several times that
he is very important to them

77
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:58,715
and that we should send someone
to the badlands as soon as possible.

78
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,551
So, with the <i>Defiant </i>gone,

79
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:05,138
and most of the runabouts off on exercises
with the Ninth Fleet...

80
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,307
We just volunteered for
a trip to the badlands.

81
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,516
Afraid so.

82
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:11,394
The <i>Shenandoah's </i>prepped
and ready to go on landing pad "A."

83
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,478
Good luck.

84
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,409
{\an8}-No.
-No?

85
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,202
{\an8}No, I'm not going to spend two weeks

86
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,038
{\an8}hiking across Vulcan's forge
in the middle of their summer.

87
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,207
{\an8}I thought you always
wanted to see the forge.

88
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,419
{\an8}See it, yes. Honeymoon there, no.

89
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,421
{\an8}Well, there's a mountain-climbing
expedition on Andor

90
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,505
{\an8}that caught my attention.

91
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,383
{\an8}Worf... My love...

92
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,051
{\an8}Let me make this very clear.

93
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,345
{\an8}I do not want to spend my honeymoon

94
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:55,475
{\an8}climbing, hiking, sweating, bleeding,
or suffering in any way.

95
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,561
{\an8}-All right, what do you want?
-Room service.

96
00:07:58,644 --> 00:07:59,687
{\an8}-Room service?
-Room service.

97
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:00,897
{\an8}I want to be pampered.

98
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,274
{\an8}I want a staff to cater to our every whim.

99
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:06,319
{\an8}I want to be embarrassed
by the size of our room.

100
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:09,030
{\an8}I want a balcony with a view
that would make you want

101
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,824
{\an8}to break down and cry
from the sheer beauty of it all.

102
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:15,369
{\an8}And I don't want to spend
one moment of our honeymoon

103
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,871
{\an8}suffering from anything

104
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:20,500
{\an8}except guilt about
our complete self-indulgence.

105
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,251
Risa.

106
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,544
Not this time.

107
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,964
Welcome to Casperia Prime,

108
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,926
the vacation capital
of the Horvarian cluster.

109
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,598
You have been planning this all along.

110
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,809
Well, it seemed fair.
You did plan the wedding.

111
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,854
Very well. Room service.

112
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,148
-Really?
-Really.

113
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,483
Well, that was easy.

114
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,985
Did you want to fight over it?

115
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,654
No. It's just...

116
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,365
I didn't expect you
to surrender so quickly.

117
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,033
-Surrender?
-Bad word.

118
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,868
-Very bad.
-OK.

119
00:08:55,952 --> 00:09:00,081
But you have to admit you've been
unusually...accommodating lately.

120
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,250
What is wrong with that?

121
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,335
Nothing. It's just...

122
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,670
Unusual.

123
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:06,963
Are you feeling all right?

124
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,756
I am a married man.

125
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:13,135
I have to make certain...
adjustments in my lifestyle.

126
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,054
Adjustments?

127
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,265
Worf, you're practically easygoing.

128
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:18,766
What's next, a sense of humor?

129
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,851
I have a sense of humor.

130
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,272
On the <i>Enterprise,</i>
I was considered to be quite amusing.

131
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,649
Well, that must've been one dull ship.

132
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,443
That is a joke!

133
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,695
I get it.

134
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,780
It is not funny, but I get it.

135
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:35,575
I don't know if I can
get used to the new you.

136
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,076
It's kind of eerie.

137
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,288
Your problem is
you cannot accept change.

138
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:43,124
-I can't accept change?
-That is correct.

139
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,750
Oh, you've got to be kidding.

140
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,044
I've changed bodies six times, Worf.

141
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,589
Yes, but you are still
very set in your ways.

142
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,008
And look who's talking.

143
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:55,928
Well, I do not have to sleep
on the same side of the bed every night,

144
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:59,265
or brush my hair exactly 50 strokes
every night,

145
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,851
or eat the same thing
for breakfast every day,

146
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,520
or read the last page of the book
before the beginning,

147
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,647
-or lift up--
-I get the point.

148
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:10,568
I don't know how you can live
with someone so monotonous.

149
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,695
It is not easy.

150
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,949
That was a joke.

151
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:22,997
This is going to be
a very, very long trip.

152
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,506
( door chimes )

153
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,883
Come in.

154
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,552
You're not dressed.

155
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,347
-Is it time?
-1700 on the dot.

156
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,848
We have the holosuite
for the next three hours,

157
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:41,932
and we're going to
need every minute of it.

158
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,352
Three British agents have disappeared
in West Berlin.

159
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:47,897
Now, M.I. Five suspect
the Soviets were involved of course.

160
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,358
However, the Americans
have intercepted a, uh...

161
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,276
What are you doing with a Tongo wheel?

162
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,195
I'm brushing up on my game.

163
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,238
-You play Tongo?
-Sure.

164
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,033
Well, I used to.

165
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,912
That is, I played the game once,
a long time ago,

166
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:06,957
with a Ferengi privateer
and a Romulan mercenary.

167
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,125
Fascinating.

168
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:11,962
Anyway, the Americans have intercepted
a series of messages from Istanbul

169
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,756
to a remote island in the South Pacific

170
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:14,965
-which might indicate--
-Let's play a hand.

171
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,050
Miles...

172
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,551
-Just one hand.
-Why?

173
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:18,803
I need the practice.

174
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,304
( sighs )

175
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,348
I want to beat Quark.

176
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,557
Good luck.

177
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,476
Luck has nothing to do with it.

178
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,896
Tongo is a game of strategy
and calculated risk.

179
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,022
I don't even know the rules.

180
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,732
Well, here.

181
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,692
All right, let's play. I'll deal.

182
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:38,823
WORF: <i>Shenandoah log: Stardate 51597.2.</i>

183
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,950
<i>We have arrived </i>
<i>at the designated coordinates</i>

184
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:44,370
<i>near the badlands and are</i>
<i>awaiting the transmission from Lasaran.</i>

185
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,082
JADZIA: This is it.

186
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:50,167
A very sophisticated encryption matrix.

187
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,336
Whoever he is, he's good.

188
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,298
<i>Who are you?</i>

189
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,427
I'm Commander Worf. This is Commander Dax.

190
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,596
Starfleet Intelligence has sent us here
to receive your transmission.

191
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:03,931
<i>A Klingon.</i>

192
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,017
<i>Why did they have to send a Klingon?</i>

193
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,562
I'm a Trill.
Does that make you feel any better?

194
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:13,566
<i>-Are you trying to be funny?</i>
-Oh, not at all. He's the funny one.

195
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,402
-What is it you want?
<i>-We'll get to that in a minute.</i>

196
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:19,321
<i>First, I have something </i>
<i>that you want, badly...</i>

197
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,073
<i>Information on the Founders.</i>

198
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,993
<i>I know how many of them</i>
<i>there are in the Alpha Quadrant,</i>

199
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,245
<i>where they are, and what they're doing.</i>

200
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,914
-We're listening.
<i>-I'm sure you are.</i>

201
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,583
<i>Now let's talk about what I want.</i>

202
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,376
<i>I want out, now.</i>

203
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,836
You want to defect.

204
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,172
<i>The Vorta advisor here </i>
<i>is getting suspicious...</i>

205
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,506
<i>Asking questions,</i>

206
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,092
<i>making a lot of routine </i>
<i>security checks in my section.</i>

207
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,052
<i>I can't stay here any longer.</i>

208
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,179
WORF: Very well.

209
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,514
We will relay your message
to Starfleet Intelligence

210
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,141
and they will arrange to bring you out.

211
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:49,143
<i>I can't wait for them </i>
<i>to make arrangements.</i>

212
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:53,397
<i>In 15 minutes, I am leaving here</i>
<i>for the Dominion base on Soukara,</i>

213
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,483
<i>and I have a feeling </i>
<i>this is going to be the last time</i>

214
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,526
<i>that they let me leave Cardassia Prime.</i>

215
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,197
<i>So, I need to take advantage </i>
<i>of this opportunity.</i>

216
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,782
Soukara is inside
Dominion-controlled space.

217
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:07,620
It will not be easy to make a rendezvous
near that planet without being detected.

218
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,872
<i>Don't work your brain too hard, Klingon.</i>

219
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,582
<i>I've taken care of everything.</i>

220
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:15,711
<i>Three days from now </i>
<i>at exactly 1730 hours local time,</i>

221
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:18,547
<i>I will leave the base </i>
<i>and walk into the jungle.</i>

222
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,884
<i>It'll be at least two days</i>
<i>before they know I'm missing.</i>

223
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:25,221
<i>All you have to do </i>
<i>is get me off the planet.</i>

224
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,724
<i>Now, there are transporter scramblers </i>
<i>protecting Soukara</i>

225
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,559
<i>so you can't beam me aboard your ship.</i>

226
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:34,647
<i>You're going to have to land</i>
<i>and meet me at a rendezvous point on foot.</i>

227
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,775
<i>I am sending you all </i>
<i>the information you'll need</i>

228
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,778
<i>to avoid the Dominion sensors </i>
<i>on the ground.</i>

229
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,738
<i>Follow my instructions.</i>

230
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:46,784
<i>Meet me at this rendezvous point</i>
<i>and have a ship waiting.</i>

231
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,871
We've got the information.
It looks pretty thorough.

232
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,957
We will need time to study these plans.

233
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,292
<i>You haven't been listening. </i>
<i>I don't have time.</i>

234
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,920
<i>Once I leave here, </i>
<i>I can't contact you again.</i>

235
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,339
<i>I have to know if you're</i>
<i>going to be there or not,</i>

236
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,091
<i>and I have to know now!</i>

237
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:06,095
We will be there.

238
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,265
<i>How far I've fallen... </i>( sighs )

239
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,601
<i>Risking my life on the word of a Klingon.</i>

240
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,188
<i>Three days. Don't be late.</i>

241
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:35,082
All right.
I'll buy at 30 with sales at 35.

242
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:38,711
Buy at 35, sell at 150
and index the margin at 10%.

243
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,714
-Index the margin?
-Miles, give it up.

244
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:44,300
-This just isn't your game.
-We'll see about that.

245
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,426
( sighs )

246
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,595
Evade.

247
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,681
Do you realize

248
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:54,184
that Quark has won
207 straight games of Tongo?

249
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,394
So?

250
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:56,729
So, someone has to beat him.

251
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,522
And that someone is you?

252
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,899
Why not?

253
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,776
Well, for one thing, you can't play Tongo.

254
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,236
Confront.

255
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,530
( groans ) Damn!

256
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,366
-Had enough?
-Not by a long shot.

257
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,077
Miles, at this rate,
it's going to take you another 20 years

258
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,579
to be ready to take on Quark.

259
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:14,747
One more.

260
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,999
( sighs ) Why are you
so determined to beat him?

261
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,376
-It's the challenge.
-A challenge?

262
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,211
Isn't it enough?

263
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,047
I mean, why do you think
I became an engineer, eh?

264
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,757
The challenge.

265
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,551
What do you think's kept me
kayaking down the same river

266
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,137
week after week for the last seven years?

267
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,972
The challenge.

268
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,266
Why would I keep playing darts
against somebody

269
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,895
with a genetically engineered
hand/eye coordination, huh?

270
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:40,230
-The challenge.
-Exactly.

271
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,693
I have to do something
to keep my mind off the fact

272
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,613
that Keiko's been away
for the last six months.

273
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,699
Hold on.

274
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,161
Maybe I can't beat Quark...

275
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,413
But you can.

276
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,708
You and that genetically
engineered brain of yours.

277
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,877
Me? I've only just learned
how to play the game.

278
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,380
Yeah, in about 10 seconds flat!

279
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,799
We can do it, Julian.

280
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,342
We can beat him.

281
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:09,635
"We"?

282
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,929
You're talking about me.

283
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:15,224
Yeah, well, you're good at calculation
but a little weak on strategy.

284
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,018
-I'll be your coach.
-No, thank you.

285
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,853
Think of it as a challenge.

286
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,730
That's your obsession, Miles, not mine.

287
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,023
Do it for the latinum.

288
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,316
Nice try.

289
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,153
Do it for the satisfaction
of the look on Quark's face

290
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:32,533
when he's beaten at a game of Tongo
by a lowly "hu-man."

291
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,284
Deal the cards.

292
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,921
We are approaching the Soukara system.

293
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,423
Stand by to bring us out of warp.

294
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,674
Now.

295
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,094
There is an asteroid field directly ahead.

296
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,220
That's what we want.

297
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,723
The Dominion's sensor grid
in the system has three gaps

298
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,850
and they're all in that asteroid field.

299
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,481
JADZIA: Want me to slow down?

300
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,817
No, unless you think you should.

301
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,861
Not at all. In fact, we could go faster.

302
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,404
By all means.

303
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,990
Ooh! A man after my own heart.

304
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,298
Most impressive.

305
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:32,217
Nothing that any
300-year-old pilot couldn't do.

306
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,845
We are being scanned from the surface.

307
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,347
JADZIA: Taking evasive maneuvers.

308
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:38,640
Did they get a fix on us?

309
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,184
WORF: I do not think so.

310
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:43,103
JADZIA: Good. We've come too long a way
just to get shot down.

311
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:46,148
If you take the helm,
I'll scan the surface for a landing site.

312
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,860
There's the base...

313
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,403
The rendezvous point...

314
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,074
And the Dominion sensor perimeter.

315
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:58,702
There's a valley about 20 kilometers
north of the rendezvous point.

316
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,829
It's a long way to go
on foot in the jungle,

317
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:04,041
but I don't think we can risk taking
the ship any closer to their sensors.

318
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,250
Agreed.

319
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,846
We have less than two days
to reach the rendezvous point.

320
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,599
About 10 kilometers a day,
that shouldn't be too bad.

321
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,768
Do not underestimate the task ahead.

322
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,854
We still have to penetrate the sensor grid
and avoid the Dominion patrols.

323
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,439
( sighs ) I know,

324
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,900
find a man in the middle
of an alien jungle,

325
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,318
then walk him out without getting caught.

326
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:32,736
Piece of cake.

327
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,155
-Ready?
-After you.

328
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,213
OK.

329
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,714
Go to 25 joules.

330
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,099
WORF: 25 joules.

331
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,311
Done.

332
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,855
That's it. We're linked.

333
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,067
Here, check my work.

334
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,572
Dominion encryption lockouts bypassed,

335
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,824
tricorder link to their sensor grids,

336
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,576
life signs masked.

337
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,702
Nicely done.

338
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,203
Thank you.

339
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:30,335
Of course, our tricorders
will be useless from now on.

340
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,587
There you go again,

341
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,672
looking for the cloud
in the silver lining.

342
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:36,175
I am not complaining.

343
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,885
I look forward to walking
through the jungle

344
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:41,138
without a map
and no idea of what lies ahead.

345
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:44,433
Well, the funny thing is you probably are.

346
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,983
This is a Ferengi-only game, gentlemen.

347
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,610
You let Dax play.

348
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,446
She's an exception, the only exception.

349
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,114
You're afraid I'll clean you out.

350
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,701
I'm afraid you'll embarrass yourself
and ruin the game for the rest of us.

351
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,786
I think I can keep up.

352
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,206
The question is, can you keep up with me?

353
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,499
Don't try and scare me
with that genetically engineered

354
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,793
intellect of yours, Doctor.

355
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,338
Tongo is more than just number crunching.

356
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:17,216
They have yet to create the computer
that can master this game.

357
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,551
Then you shouldn't have
anything to worry about.

358
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:24,014
You realize we are not playing for drinks.

359
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,642
This is a high stakes game.

360
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,269
We came to play.

361
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,855
Gentlemen?

362
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,815
( grunting )

363
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,693
All right.

364
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:40,155
The buy-in is five strips,
and you're dealing.

365
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:46,662
You better get off to a fast start.

366
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,789
They won't know what hit them.

367
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,755
Buy at 300, sell at 350.

368
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:03,178
You're a quick study, Doctor.
I'll give you that.

369
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,430
You mean quick for a "hu-man,"
don't you, Quark?

370
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,433
I would never say anything
so distasteful during a game.

371
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,227
No, you'd wait until it was over.

372
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,312
Of course.

373
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,605
Evade.

374
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,151
Dax was a quick study too.

375
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,362
She told me it only took her two weeks
to win her first match.

376
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,738
That's practically unheard of.

377
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,074
Dax specializes in the unexpected.

378
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:26,660
Still buying at 300, selling at four.

379
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,664
I'd like to index the margin at 20%.

380
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:32,666
Interesting.

381
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:35,836
She certainly did the unexpected
when she married Commander Boring.

382
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,337
That's for sure.

383
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,673
When they first started seeing each other,
I thought,

384
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:42,759
"This can't last. I give it two months."

385
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,263
I'll buy at 400...

386
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:47,556
And sell at five.

387
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,683
I had the same thought.

388
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,685
Although, to tell you the truth,
I only gave it a month.

389
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,228
Confront.

390
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,397
She's a real heart-breaker, that one.

391
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,692
That she is.

392
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:02,821
Leverage the buy-in and sell at 550.

393
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,116
You know...

394
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:09,661
You go through a lot of ups and downs
in my business.

395
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:14,041
There are days when the profits are down,
and the customers are scarce,

396
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:17,836
and you think you'll never see
another strip of latinum again,

397
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:22,341
And then, Jadzia comes in...

398
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:25,260
And flashes that smile of hers.

399
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,972
Suddenly things
don't seem so bad after all.

400
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,974
I know exactly what you mean.

401
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:34,978
You know,
sometimes she walks past the infirmary,

402
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:38,190
and all she has to do is wink,
and somehow, that...

403
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:40,108
makes my whole day look a little brighter.

404
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,860
Focus, Julian. Focus.

405
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:43,361
Shh!

406
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:48,950
I'll, uh, buy that 550, and...

407
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,244
Index the exchange at 10.

408
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,830
And now she's married.

409
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:54,790
Married.

410
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,374
Out of reach.

411
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,753
I'm converting my reserves...

412
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,255
And selling at 600.

413
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,759
You know what's really sad?

414
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:08,470
What really keeps me awake at night?

415
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:11,181
She's out of reach because we let her go.

416
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:15,560
Yes, I suppose so...

417
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,646
But some things just weren't meant to be.

418
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:20,690
Evade.

419
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,067
Julian!

420
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,527
Are you sure you want to--

421
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,780
Chief! Please. You know the rules.

422
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:28,448
No coaching during a round.

423
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:34,830
You're probably right.

424
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,876
But what if that's
a convenient rationalization?

425
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:45,632
What if deep down in our heart of hearts,
we both know she's something unique...

426
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,884
Something we may never see again,

427
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,719
a chance at true happiness?

428
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:52,514
And we let her slip through our fingers.

429
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,142
What if 50 years from now
we each look back

430
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:58,019
and say, "What a fool I was"?

431
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,859
Confront.

432
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:05,861
Doctor?

433
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,195
Hmm?

434
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,613
Confront.

435
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,073
Oh.

436
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,616
Sorry. Um...

437
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:14,369
Full consortium.

438
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,250
Total monopoly.

439
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,085
-What?
-( Ferengis snickering )

440
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,215
You seem to be out of money.

441
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,050
Miles?

442
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:30,886
We're busted.

443
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,220
Thanks for the game.

444
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,638
Welcome back anytime.

445
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:34,639
BASHIR: Wait.

446
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:38,977
Quark, did you really mean all that
about Dax...

447
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,646
Being my one last chance
for true happiness?

448
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:48,653
Doctor, you don't expect me
to show you all my cards, do you?

449
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,072
( money rattling )

450
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,576
( sighs ) You lost.

451
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:55,827
What ever happened to "we"?

452
00:24:55,911 --> 00:25:00,790
We weren't mooning over lost love
with a Ferengi holding a total monopoly.

453
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,376
You mean all that about Dax
was meant to distract me?

454
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,003
Obviously.

455
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:07,130
I can't believe I let him get to me.

456
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:09,841
Ah. Well... Not your fault.

457
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:14,888
Genetically engineered or not,
you're still "hu-man."

458
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:18,808
( rueful chuckling ) I guess.

459
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,645
-Let's get a drink.
-( groaning )

460
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:48,421
( device humming )

461
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,483
Ow!

462
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,581
( shivering )

463
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:09,377
Oh, let's not stand on pride, shall we?

464
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:12,213
Trills don't like the heat
and Klingons don't like the cold.

465
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,174
There's no shame in admitting it.

466
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,176
Thank you.

467
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:17,635
You're welcome.

468
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,764
So, how are you enjoying your honeymoon?

469
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,974
Are you suffering enough?

470
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,517
Almost.

471
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,895
Is there anything I can get for you?

472
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:29,689
More pain.

473
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,358
Less cold.

474
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:32,942
( laughing )

475
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:35,195
I don't know why that's funny, but it is.

476
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,946
( animal howling )

477
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,990
Mating call?

478
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:40,950
500 meters.

479
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,119
That way.

480
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,871
( howling )

481
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,500
Well, that didn't take long.

482
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,169
Less than 300 meters.

483
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:53,421
( howling )

484
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,674
( sighs ) Another happy couple.

485
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,598
When I was a boy,

486
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:08,269
my father used to take my brother and me
on camping trips in the Ural mountains.

487
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:13,900
Every night, we would listen to the wolves
howling in the distance.

488
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,112
Nikolai was afraid of them,

489
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:20,615
but I would lay in my tent for hours,
just listening.

490
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:27,330
I remember being seized by the urge
to just rip off my clothes

491
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,833
and run into the night
and live in the forest,

492
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:33,044
and become something... wild.

493
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:36,423
( howling )

494
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:42,303
He must have been rejected.
He's moving away.

495
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,265
( howling and growling )

496
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:46,975
She's not happy.

497
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,143
( twig snaps )

498
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,853
( growling )

499
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:52,105
What? They're getting further away,
aren't they?

500
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:55,608
Yes, but it's because
something is coming.

501
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:58,570
And it is close.

502
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,878
( brush rustling )

503
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,808
( device beeping )

504
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,579
( yelling and grunting )

505
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,668
( strangled gurgling yell )

506
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,379
( groaning )

507
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,089
Jadzia!

508
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,300
( gasping )

509
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,139
( gasping )

510
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,392
Lie still.

511
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,228
I think I can do that.

512
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:15,647
( groaning )

513
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,273
Can I have the good news first?

514
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:22,695
No vital organs were damaged.

515
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,864
Now the bad news?

516
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:27,659
The disruptor burst
left an anti-coagulant in your system.

517
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,703
So you can't stop the bleeding?

518
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:31,996
No.

519
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,958
Well, I must not have taken
the whole burst.

520
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,794
I'm not hemorrhaging that bad yet.

521
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:41,339
Just keep me pumped full of painkillers,
and let's be on our way.

522
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:42,882
Moving could make the bleeding worse.

523
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,968
Staying here isn't an option.

524
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,137
Someone's going to come looking for them
when they don't check in,

525
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,515
and I'd rather take my chances on foot.

526
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:51,683
You ready?

527
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:56,354
-You ready?
-Ready.

528
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:58,314
Let's go.

529
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,358
( grunting )

530
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,541
( groans softly )

531
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,844
We are still 12 kilometers
from the rendezvous point.

532
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:29,721
And only 20 hours left.

533
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:33,516
Well, I guess it's time
we stop having so much fun

534
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,351
and pick up the pace, huh?

535
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:38,062
Oh, more plasma.

536
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,189
No, thanks. I'm full. ( chuckles weakly )

537
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,568
Your blood pressure
has dropped another 20%.

538
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:45,612
Love that bedside manner.

539
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,488
You know, you should have been a doctor?

540
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,995
Your bandage will need to be changed soon.

541
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:59,292
Well, I think I'd like a blue
chiffon bandage this time,

542
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,044
maybe some rhinestones.

543
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:02,712
Something with a little pizazz.

544
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:04,380
This is no joking matter.

545
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,673
You are seriously injured,

546
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,258
and we have
a great deal of terrain to cover.

547
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,928
Just trying to lighten the mood.

548
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:12,221
This is neither the time nor the place.

549
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:14,474
What happened to that new Worf?

550
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:16,851
You know, the one with the sense of humor?

551
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,479
That was a mistake.

552
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,606
Oh, what is that supposed to mean?

553
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:23,608
It means if I had
not been joking with you,

554
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:26,486
I would not have allowed
the Jem'Hadar to get so close.

555
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:29,113
( sighs ) So this is all my fault.

556
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,657
No.

557
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,200
It is mine.

558
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:35,411
I was trying to be something I am not.

559
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:38,039
By letting down my guard,
by ignoring my duty,

560
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,041
I allowed my wife to be injured,

561
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,502
and I put the entire mission in jeopardy.

562
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,879
It will not happen again.

563
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:46,923
That's not what happened.

564
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:51,594
-Without our tricorders, there's no way--
-I do not wish to debate this.

565
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,307
We have a long way to go
and very little time.

566
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,518
Fine. Let's go.

567
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,311
( grunts )

568
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:28,840
( device beeping )

569
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:36,931
Ready?

570
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,225
( softly ) Yeah.

571
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:03,958
( groaning )

572
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,806
( groans )

573
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,772
Hypo.

574
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:34,530
( groaning )

575
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,326
There. Good as new.

576
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:46,918
I have to change your dressing.

577
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:50,296
That's four bandages in two hours.

578
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,799
That's got to be some kind of record.

579
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:57,470
Oh, sorry. I forgot the new rules.
Nothing funny.

580
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:59,055
Got to be serious.

581
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:00,932
Life and death.

582
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:02,642
We've got a job to do.

583
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,648
Jadzia, I know you are tired,

584
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:12,610
but we have to cover three kilometers
before nightfall. Can you do it?

585
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,822
As long as you got those painkillers,

586
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:18,407
I'll follow you
through the gates of hell, sir.

587
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:20,743
Hmm...

588
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:23,871
Oh, that was almost a smile.

589
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:31,462
When this mission is over,
I will smile all you want.

590
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,422
Oh, you promise?

591
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,424
I promise.

592
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:40,346
Then let's finish this mission
and get out of here.

593
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:43,975
( both grunt )

594
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,643
Whoa.

595
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:46,769
( groans )

596
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,396
That's all right, I can stand.

597
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,814
Just help me get my balance.

598
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,315
Help me balance.

599
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,818
Or maybe not.

600
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,570
( gasps )

601
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:00,408
( grunting )

602
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:06,581
( beeping )

603
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:12,295
Let me guess. Things aren't looking up.

604
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,881
There's been another drop
in your blood pressure.

605
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:17,049
And your neural E.D.L. readings
are erratic.

606
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,553
So what's your prescription, doc?

607
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:24,140
Surgery... at a Starbase.

608
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:26,767
Could I get a second opinion?

609
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:37,528
Worf, you have to go on without me...

610
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:39,488
And I know that.

611
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,199
I understand.

612
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,826
My duty requires
that I complete the mission

613
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,620
regardless of my personal feelings.

614
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:47,330
Absolutely.

615
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:49,207
You're a Starfleet officer.

616
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,792
So am I, and I understand.

617
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:56,380
The information Lasaran has could be
potentially invaluable to the war effort.

618
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:59,175
You don't have to explain to me.

619
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:01,510
I'm hurt. You're not.

620
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,680
And there's a job to be done.

621
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,265
I will be back tomorrow night.

622
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,769
Don't worry.

623
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,395
I'm not going anywhere.

624
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:15,650
I can have you in the stasis chamber
on the runabout in 45 hours.

625
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,527
No problem.

626
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,030
I will leave the med kit.

627
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:23,741
Scan yourself with the tricorder
every half hour.

628
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,576
The plasma hypospray will be set--

629
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,580
I took basic first aid.
I know what I have to do.

630
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,294
Worf.

631
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,966
It's been a great two months, hasn't it?

632
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,470
Yes.

633
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:51,727
Jadzia, I just want to tell you how--

634
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,563
( whispers ) Just kiss me and go.

635
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,629
( sobbing )

636
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:37,106
( heart beating )

637
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,330
( beating louder )

638
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:19,982
( sighs )

639
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,339
What's the word?

640
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:49,095
She is still in surgery,

641
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:52,473
but Dr. Bashir is hopeful
she will make a full recovery.

642
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,767
Lasaran's dead.

643
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,186
Starfleet intelligence
intercepted a transmission

644
00:39:57,269 --> 00:40:00,940
saying that he'd been killed
trying to reenter the base at Soukara.

645
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:02,983
Could you have made the rendezvous?

646
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,235
Yes.

647
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,571
-But yet you turned back to save Jadzia.
-Yes.

648
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:09,907
Were you aware that
the information that man had

649
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:12,076
could have saved millions of lives?

650
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:14,120
Yes.

651
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:15,871
So what happened?

652
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,000
-You may not understand.
-Try me, sir.

653
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,672
You were at my wedding.

654
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,091
You heard the story
of the first two Klingon hearts

655
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,926
and how nothing could stand against them

656
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:32,138
and how they even destroyed
the Gods that had created them.

657
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:35,433
I have heard that story since I was a boy,

658
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,935
but I never understood it...

659
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:40,020
I mean really understood it...

660
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:44,525
Until I was standing in the jungle
with my heart pounding in my chest,

661
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:48,112
and I found that even I could
not stand against my own heart.

662
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:50,322
I had to go back.

663
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:53,033
And it did not matter
what Starfleet thought,

664
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,452
or what the consequences were.

665
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:57,455
She was my wife and I could not leave her.

666
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,750
As your captain,
it is my duty to inform you

667
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,961
that you made the wrong choice.

668
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:08,215
I don't think Starfleet will file
any formal charges.

669
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:11,218
Even a secret court-martial
would run the risk

670
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:14,305
of revealing too much about
their intelligence operations.

671
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:18,350
But this will go into your service record.

672
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,938
And to be completely honest,

673
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:26,650
you probably won't be offered
a command on your own after this.

674
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:29,904
I understand.

675
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:32,323
I've also issued new orders.

676
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:34,617
You and Jadzia are not
to be assigned to a mission

677
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,785
on your own ever again.

678
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:43,876
And one last thing.

679
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:47,296
As a man who had a wife...

680
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:52,176
If Jennifer had been
lying in that clearing...

681
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,679
I wouldn't have left her either.

682
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,270
( door opens )

683
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:24,250
Hey.

684
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:26,669
( whispers ) I know you.

685
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,255
We have met.

686
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:32,049
Ah, you're joking again.

687
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,260
That's a good sign.

688
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,263
Did you make the rendezvous?

689
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:39,640
No.

690
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:43,602
( softly) I could not leave you there.

691
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:48,732
Not for Lasaran, not for the mission,
not for anything else.

692
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,151
Lasaran?

693
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:54,280
Dead.

694
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,907
Are you in trouble?

695
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,742
I have been in trouble before.

696
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:01,537
I'm sorry.

697
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,914
I should have kept going.

698
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:07,001
You have nothing to be sorry about.

699
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:11,088
I know how much your career means to you.

700
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,549
You come first.

701
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,928
Before career, before duty,
before anything.

702
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:21,473
I do not regret what I did,

703
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:25,144
and I would do it again.

704
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:28,814
I don't know what to say.

705
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:34,069
You could say,
"Thank you for saving my life."

706
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:38,532
Thank you for saving my life.

707
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:42,620
And you could say,
"I would do the same for you, Worf."

708
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:47,041
Well... I'd have to think about that.

709
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,878
My career is very important to me,
you know.

710
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,131
( sighs )

711
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:58,218
And you could say, "I love you."

712
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:03,974
I love you.

713
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:06,644
And I love you.
