1
00:00:11,548 --> 00:00:12,846
Sell at 20.

2
00:00:12,884 --> 00:00:14,352
Is that a joke?

3
00:00:14,387 --> 00:00:15,947
Do I look like I'm joking?

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,151
Oh.

5
00:00:17,192 --> 00:00:18,490
Evade.

6
00:00:19,931 --> 00:00:21,867
Discount the exchange by 15.

7
00:00:21,902 --> 00:00:23,200
She has him.

8
00:00:23,238 --> 00:00:24,706
She's down 50 strips.

9
00:00:24,741 --> 00:00:26,073
Not for long.

10
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,080
What makes you so sure?

11
00:00:28,114 --> 00:00:31,416
Well, Jadzia is playing
a very deep game.

12
00:00:31,454 --> 00:00:34,324
Her strategy will become
apparent any moment now.

13
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,350
I see.

14
00:00:35,395 --> 00:00:36,556
Selling at 35...

15
00:00:36,598 --> 00:00:38,727
You have absolutely no idea

16
00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:41,400
how this game is played, do you?

17
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:44,106
No.

18
00:00:44,146 --> 00:00:47,050
But I have developed
a new appreciation for it.

19
00:00:47,086 --> 00:00:48,179
Oh? Since when?

20
00:00:48,221 --> 00:00:50,191
Since I married a <i>tongo</i> player.

21
00:00:50,225 --> 00:00:52,491
But one thing
I am certain about...

22
00:00:52,529 --> 00:00:55,057
she will defeat
the Ferengi bartender.

23
00:00:55,102 --> 00:00:56,662
I don't know about that.

24
00:00:56,705 --> 00:00:58,037
Quark's on a roll.

25
00:00:58,074 --> 00:01:01,741
In the last month,
he's won 206 straight games.

26
00:01:04,253 --> 00:01:06,723
Would you care to make a wager
on the outcome?

27
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:09,424
Oh, I wouldn't want to bet
against a man's wife.

28
00:01:09,463 --> 00:01:10,989
Well, if you are afraid, I...

29
00:01:11,033 --> 00:01:12,559
No. Name your stakes.

30
00:01:12,604 --> 00:01:14,164
One bottle of bloodwine

31
00:01:14,206 --> 00:01:16,574
against one bottle
of Scotch whiskey.

32
00:01:16,612 --> 00:01:17,705
- Done.
- Increase.

33
00:01:17,747 --> 00:01:18,874
- Evade.
- Evade.

34
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:19,941
Increase.

35
00:01:19,985 --> 00:01:22,114
A sale at 50
and a purchase at 100.

36
00:01:22,156 --> 00:01:23,146
Ah.

37
00:01:23,191 --> 00:01:25,127
No.

38
00:01:25,162 --> 00:01:28,259
Pretty big talk for a lady
who's lost 50 strips.

39
00:01:28,368 --> 00:01:30,838
Are you afraid
I can't cover my bets?

40
00:01:30,873 --> 00:01:32,171
Perish the thought.

41
00:01:32,209 --> 00:01:35,272
I just hate to kick somebody
when they're down.

42
00:01:35,382 --> 00:01:39,482
I'll buy at 100 and confront.

43
00:01:39,523 --> 00:01:41,083
Well, if you're going to kick me

44
00:01:41,127 --> 00:01:42,653
I'm going to have to kick back.

45
00:01:42,697 --> 00:01:44,690
Unbelievable.

46
00:01:44,734 --> 00:01:47,604
<i>ESHta par'machkai!</i>

47
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,044
I like my bloodwine
very young and very sweet.

48
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,913
Is he a friend of yours?

49
00:01:52,951 --> 00:01:54,419
Just a fan.

50
00:01:54,453 --> 00:01:58,257
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to disappoint all your fans.

51
00:02:00,265 --> 00:02:01,894
A full consortium?

52
00:02:01,935 --> 00:02:03,905
Two hundred and seven.

53
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:04,907
A single malt

54
00:02:04,941 --> 00:02:07,207
preferably something
from the Highlands.

55
00:02:07,246 --> 00:02:08,977
I will need some time.

56
00:02:09,016 --> 00:02:10,576
Oh, your credit's good.

57
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,621
Whoo, 207 straight.

58
00:02:16,665 --> 00:02:20,001
36 strips
of gold-pressed latinum.

59
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:23,502
Did you lose a bet?

60
00:02:23,545 --> 00:02:24,808
It is of no consequence.

61
00:02:24,848 --> 00:02:26,214
I'm sorry about that.

62
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,025
I would rather lose a bet on you

63
00:02:32,062 --> 00:02:33,759
than win on someone else.

64
00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:35,962
Ooh, good response.

65
00:02:43,786 --> 00:02:46,815
Are you still running
that drill tomorrow afternoon?

66
00:02:46,858 --> 00:02:48,326
I was planning to.
Why?

67
00:02:48,361 --> 00:02:49,329
Because I wanted

68
00:02:49,363 --> 00:02:51,060
to recalibrate
the external sensors

69
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,229
before the night watch
comes on duty.

70
00:02:53,271 --> 00:02:56,802
We should be done by 1600 hours.

71
00:02:56,845 --> 00:02:59,874
Well, I think that'll work.

72
00:02:59,918 --> 00:03:02,081
Oh, the <i>Sutherland</i> is going
to be here

73
00:03:02,122 --> 00:03:04,251
the day after tomorrow and...

74
00:03:20,926 --> 00:03:22,555
You were saying?

75
00:03:22,596 --> 00:03:23,996
Nothing.

76
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:31,502
I don't feel
like talking anymore.

77
00:03:52,355 --> 00:03:54,450
Kira to Worf.

78
00:04:01,373 --> 00:04:02,899
Worf here.

79
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:06,611
Sorry to bother you, Commander,
but I need to see you and Jadzia

80
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,711
in the Captain's office
immediately.

81
00:04:08,756 --> 00:04:11,226
We're on our way.

82
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,372
Jadzia...

83
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:20,775
get up.

84
00:04:20,813 --> 00:04:22,247
I'm coming!

85
00:04:22,282 --> 00:04:24,411
Hey!

86
00:04:24,486 --> 00:04:27,515
We don't have a lot of time,
so I'll get right to it.

87
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,925
For the last two months

88
00:04:28,962 --> 00:04:31,798
Starfleet has been receiving
military intelligence

89
00:04:31,835 --> 00:04:33,064
from a Cardassian operative.

90
00:04:33,104 --> 00:04:34,265
That operative has now sent

91
00:04:34,306 --> 00:04:36,333
an emergency signal
indicating he needs

92
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:39,440
to speak to someone
in a face-to-face conversation.

93
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,884
In 13 hours,
he'll beam an encrypted

94
00:04:41,922 --> 00:04:43,322
subspace transmission

95
00:04:43,357 --> 00:04:45,418
to these coordinates
in the Badlands.

96
00:04:45,461 --> 00:04:46,952
Who is the operative?

97
00:04:46,998 --> 00:04:49,468
Intelligence told me
that his name is Lasaran.

98
00:04:49,536 --> 00:04:52,269
But that's all they'll say
about him.

99
00:04:52,309 --> 00:04:53,470
They did emphasize

100
00:04:53,511 --> 00:04:55,640
several times that he is
very important to them

101
00:04:55,682 --> 00:04:57,116
and that we should send someone

102
00:04:57,152 --> 00:04:59,179
to the Badlands
as soon as possible.

103
00:04:59,223 --> 00:05:03,323
So, with the <i>Defiant</i> gone
and most of the runabouts off

104
00:05:03,364 --> 00:05:04,855
on exercises
with the Ninth Fleet...

105
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:07,532
We just volunteered
for a trip to the Badlands.

106
00:05:07,572 --> 00:05:09,006
Afraid so.

107
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,010
The <i>Shenandoah's</i> prepped

108
00:05:10,044 --> 00:05:11,444
and ready to go
on Landing Pad A.

109
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,470
Good luck.

110
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:29,339
No.

111
00:07:29,384 --> 00:07:30,352
No?

112
00:07:30,386 --> 00:07:31,912
No. I'm not going
to spend two weeks

113
00:07:31,956 --> 00:07:34,553
hiking across Vulcan's Forge
in the middle of their summer.

114
00:07:34,594 --> 00:07:36,655
I thought you always
wanted to see the Forge.

115
00:07:36,698 --> 00:07:37,791
See it, yes.

116
00:07:37,901 --> 00:07:39,666
Honeymoon there, no.

117
00:07:39,704 --> 00:07:42,072
Well, there's a mountain-
climbing expedition on Andor

118
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,237
that caught my attention...

119
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:45,772
Worf... my love...

120
00:07:45,816 --> 00:07:47,479
let me make this very clear.

121
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,786
I do not want
to spend my honeymoon

122
00:07:49,824 --> 00:07:51,817
climbing, hiking
sweating, bleeding

123
00:07:51,862 --> 00:07:53,991
or suffering in any way.

124
00:07:54,034 --> 00:07:56,004
All right.
What do you want?

125
00:07:56,038 --> 00:07:57,165
Room service.

126
00:07:57,206 --> 00:07:58,367
- Room service?
- Room service.

127
00:07:58,409 --> 00:07:59,536
I want to be pampered.

128
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:01,570
I want a staff to cater
to our every whim.

129
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:04,644
I want to be embarrassed
by the size of our room.

130
00:08:04,688 --> 00:08:07,022
I want a balcony with a view

131
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,030
that would make you want
to break down and cry

132
00:08:09,064 --> 00:08:10,464
from the sheer beauty
of it all

133
00:08:10,499 --> 00:08:14,098
and I don't want to spend
one moment of our honeymoon

134
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,472
suffering from anything

135
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:19,415
except guilt about our complete
self-indulgence.

136
00:08:19,451 --> 00:08:21,216
Risa.

137
00:08:21,254 --> 00:08:22,688
Not this time.

138
00:08:22,724 --> 00:08:25,594
Welcome to Casperia Prime

139
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:28,601
the vacation capital
of the Horvian Cluster.

140
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,680
You have been planning this
all along.

141
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:35,841
Well, it seemed fair.

142
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:37,785
You did plan the wedding.

143
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,756
Very well.

144
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:40,816
Room service.

145
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,828
Really?

146
00:08:41,862 --> 00:08:42,852
Really.

147
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,388
Well, that was easy.

148
00:08:45,403 --> 00:08:46,963
Did you want to fight over it?

149
00:08:47,005 --> 00:08:48,303
No. It's just...

150
00:08:48,342 --> 00:08:51,439
I didn't expect you
to surrender so quickly.

151
00:08:51,481 --> 00:08:52,107
Surrender?

152
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:52,981
Bad word.

153
00:08:53,017 --> 00:08:53,712
Very bad.

154
00:08:53,752 --> 00:08:54,720
Okay.

155
00:08:54,754 --> 00:08:55,722
But you have to admit

156
00:08:55,756 --> 00:08:59,058
you've been unusually...
accommodating lately.

157
00:08:59,097 --> 00:09:00,760
What is wrong with that?

158
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,790
Nothing.

159
00:09:01,835 --> 00:09:03,235
It's just...

160
00:09:03,272 --> 00:09:04,740
unusual.

161
00:09:04,774 --> 00:09:05,969
Are you feeling all right?

162
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,536
I am a married man.

163
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,743
I have to make certain...

164
00:09:09,784 --> 00:09:11,651
adjustments in my lifestyle.

165
00:09:11,688 --> 00:09:13,681
Adjustments?

166
00:09:13,725 --> 00:09:15,786
Worf, you're
practically easygoing.

167
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,766
What's next... a sense of humor?

168
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,463
I have a sense of humor.

169
00:09:19,504 --> 00:09:20,733
On the <i>Enterprise</i>

170
00:09:20,773 --> 00:09:23,336
I was considered
to be quite amusing.

171
00:09:23,378 --> 00:09:25,610
Well, that must've been
one dull ship.

172
00:09:26,651 --> 00:09:28,085
That is a joke.

173
00:09:28,122 --> 00:09:29,751
I get it.

174
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,761
It is not funny, but I get it.

175
00:09:31,795 --> 00:09:34,858
I don't know if I can get used
to the new you.

176
00:09:34,901 --> 00:09:35,891
It's kind of eerie.

177
00:09:35,936 --> 00:09:39,375
Your problem is
you cannot accept change.

178
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,901
I can't accept change?

179
00:09:40,946 --> 00:09:42,039
That is correct.

180
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,848
Oh, you've got to be kidding.

181
00:09:43,886 --> 00:09:46,049
I've changed bodies
six times, Worf.

182
00:09:46,091 --> 00:09:48,619
Yes, but you are still
very set in your ways.

183
00:09:48,662 --> 00:09:50,928
And look who's talking.

184
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,629
Well, I do not have to sleep

185
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,902
on the same side
of the bed every night

186
00:09:54,941 --> 00:09:58,311
or brush my hair exactly 50
strokes every night

187
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:01,081
or eat the same thing
for breakfast every day or read

188
00:10:01,121 --> 00:10:02,214
the last page of the book

189
00:10:02,256 --> 00:10:03,953
before the beginning,
of lift up the...

190
00:10:03,992 --> 00:10:06,896
I get the point.

191
00:10:06,932 --> 00:10:09,870
I don't know how you can live
with someone so monotonous.

192
00:10:09,904 --> 00:10:11,840
It is not easy.

193
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,041
That was a joke.

194
00:10:17,553 --> 00:10:22,154
This is going to be
a very, very long trip.

195
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:32,705
Come in.

196
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:35,782
You're not dressed.

197
00:10:35,823 --> 00:10:36,791
Is it time?

198
00:10:36,825 --> 00:10:37,793
1700 on the dot.

199
00:10:37,827 --> 00:10:39,387
We have the holosuite
for the next three hours

200
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,898
and we're going to
need every minute of it.

201
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:43,165
Three British agents
have disappeared in West Berlin.

202
00:10:43,205 --> 00:10:46,700
Now, Ml5 suspects the Soviets
were involved, of course.

203
00:10:46,745 --> 00:10:48,977
However, the Americans
have intercepted a, uh...

204
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:50,883
What are you doing
with a <i>tongo</i> wheel?

205
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:52,410
I'm brushing up on my game.

206
00:10:52,456 --> 00:10:54,289
You play <i>tongo?</i>

207
00:10:54,327 --> 00:10:55,317
Sure.

208
00:10:55,362 --> 00:10:57,423
Well, I used to.

209
00:10:59,203 --> 00:11:01,936
That is, I played a game
once, a long time ago

210
00:11:01,975 --> 00:11:05,710
with a Ferengi privateer
and a Romulan mercenary.

211
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:07,012
Fascinating.

212
00:11:07,085 --> 00:11:08,679
Anyway, the Americans
have intercepted

213
00:11:08,722 --> 00:11:10,156
a series of messages
from Istanbul

214
00:11:10,192 --> 00:11:11,855
to a remote island
in the South Pacific

215
00:11:11,895 --> 00:11:13,022
which might indicate...

216
00:11:13,064 --> 00:11:14,032
Let's play a hand.

217
00:11:14,066 --> 00:11:15,034
Miles...

218
00:11:15,068 --> 00:11:16,036
Just one hand.

219
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,038
Why?

220
00:11:17,072 --> 00:11:18,040
I need the practice.

221
00:11:19,344 --> 00:11:21,177
I want to beat Quark.

222
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:22,273
Good luck.

223
00:11:22,316 --> 00:11:23,910
Luck has nothing to do with it.

224
00:11:23,952 --> 00:11:28,052
<i>Tongo</i> is a game of strategy
and calculated risk.

225
00:11:28,094 --> 00:11:29,289
I don't even know the rules.

226
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,320
Well, here.

227
00:11:30,366 --> 00:11:31,995
All right, let's play.

228
00:11:32,035 --> 00:11:33,298
I'll deal.

229
00:11:33,338 --> 00:11:37,836
<i>Shenandoah</i> Log,
Stardate 51597.2.

230
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,850
We have arrived at the
designated coordinates

231
00:11:39,884 --> 00:11:41,547
near the Badlands
and are awaiting

232
00:11:41,588 --> 00:11:43,717
the transmission from Lasaran.

233
00:11:45,696 --> 00:11:47,495
This is it.

234
00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:49,400
A very sophisticated
encryption matrix.

235
00:11:49,437 --> 00:11:51,498
Whoever he is, he's good.

236
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:55,482
Who are you?

237
00:11:55,516 --> 00:11:56,779
I'm Commander Worf.

238
00:11:56,818 --> 00:11:58,447
This is Commander Dax.

239
00:11:58,488 --> 00:12:00,287
Starfleet intelligence
has sent us here

240
00:12:00,325 --> 00:12:01,885
to receive your transmission.

241
00:12:01,928 --> 00:12:03,055
A Klingon.

242
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:06,193
Why did they have
to send a Klingon?

243
00:12:06,237 --> 00:12:08,730
I'm a Trill... does that
make you feel any better?

244
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:10,335
Are you trying to be funny?

245
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:11,540
Oh, not at all.

246
00:12:11,581 --> 00:12:12,776
He's the funny one.

247
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:14,411
What is it you want?

248
00:12:14,454 --> 00:12:15,717
We'll get to that in a minute.

249
00:12:15,756 --> 00:12:17,692
First, I have something
that you want, badly...

250
00:12:17,726 --> 00:12:20,596
information on the Founders.

251
00:12:20,632 --> 00:12:22,864
I know how many of them
there are in the Alpha Quadrant

252
00:12:22,903 --> 00:12:25,431
where they are,
and what they're doing.

253
00:12:25,476 --> 00:12:26,739
We're listening.

254
00:12:26,778 --> 00:12:28,076
I'm sure you are.

255
00:12:28,113 --> 00:12:30,276
Now let's talk
about what I want.

256
00:12:30,319 --> 00:12:31,548
I want out, now.

257
00:12:31,588 --> 00:12:32,886
You want to defect.

258
00:12:32,923 --> 00:12:33,982
The Vorta advisor here

259
00:12:34,025 --> 00:12:36,553
is getting suspicious...
asking questions

260
00:12:36,598 --> 00:12:39,263
making a lot of routine
security checks in my section.

261
00:12:39,303 --> 00:12:40,897
I can't stay here any longer.

262
00:12:40,939 --> 00:12:42,066
Very well.

263
00:12:42,108 --> 00:12:44,476
We will relay your message
to Starfleet intelligence

264
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,279
and they will arrange
to bring you out.

265
00:12:46,317 --> 00:12:48,480
I can't wait for them
to make arrangements.

266
00:12:48,522 --> 00:12:50,549
In 15 minutes, I am leaving here

267
00:12:50,592 --> 00:12:52,562
for the Dominion base
on Soukara

268
00:12:52,596 --> 00:12:54,429
and I have a feeling this is
going to be the last time

269
00:12:54,467 --> 00:12:56,437
that they let me leave
Cardassia Prime.

270
00:12:56,471 --> 00:13:00,172
So I need to take advantage
of this opportunity.

271
00:13:00,211 --> 00:13:02,808
Soukara is inside
Dominion-controlled space.

272
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,581
It will not be easy
to make a rendezvous

273
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,590
near that planet
without being detected.

274
00:13:06,624 --> 00:13:08,787
Don't work your brain
too hard, Klingon.

275
00:13:08,828 --> 00:13:10,559
I've taken care of everything.

276
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:14,903
Three days from now,
at exactly 1730 hours local time

277
00:13:14,941 --> 00:13:17,777
I will leave the base
and walk into the jungle.

278
00:13:17,813 --> 00:13:21,149
It'll be at least two days
before they know I'm missing.

279
00:13:21,186 --> 00:13:24,124
All you have to do
is get me off the planet.

280
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:26,858
Now, there are transporter
scramblers protecting Soukara

281
00:13:26,898 --> 00:13:28,731
so you can't beam me
aboard your ship.

282
00:13:28,768 --> 00:13:30,031
You're going to have

283
00:13:30,071 --> 00:13:33,602
to land and meet me
at a rendezvous point on foot.

284
00:13:33,645 --> 00:13:34,908
I am sending you

285
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,748
all the information
you will need

286
00:13:37,786 --> 00:13:40,383
to avoid the Dominion sensors
on the ground.

287
00:13:40,425 --> 00:13:41,791
Follow my instructions.

288
00:13:41,828 --> 00:13:46,201
Meet me at this rendezvous point
and have a ship waiting.

289
00:13:46,236 --> 00:13:48,103
We've got the information.

290
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,973
It looks pretty thorough.

291
00:13:50,011 --> 00:13:52,140
We will need time
to study these plans.

292
00:13:52,181 --> 00:13:53,206
You haven't been listening.

293
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,309
I don't have time.

294
00:13:54,353 --> 00:13:56,687
Once I leave here,
I can't contact you again.

295
00:13:56,724 --> 00:13:58,956
I have to know
if you're going to be there

296
00:13:58,995 --> 00:14:01,329
or not, and I have to know now!

297
00:14:03,738 --> 00:14:05,001
We will be there.

298
00:14:06,276 --> 00:14:09,180
How far I've fallen...

299
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:12,016
risking my life
on the word of a Klingon.

300
00:14:12,055 --> 00:14:14,025
Three days.

301
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:16,029
Don't be late.

302
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:31,791
All right.

303
00:14:31,828 --> 00:14:34,391
I'll buy at 30 with sales at 35.

304
00:14:34,433 --> 00:14:35,799
Buy at 35, sell at 150

305
00:14:35,836 --> 00:14:38,136
and index the margin
at ten percent.

306
00:14:38,173 --> 00:14:40,040
Index the margin?

307
00:14:40,077 --> 00:14:41,045
Miles, give it up.

308
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:42,342
This just isn't your game.

309
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,576
We'll see about that.

310
00:14:45,722 --> 00:14:46,951
Evade.

311
00:14:48,595 --> 00:14:49,961
Do you realize

312
00:14:49,997 --> 00:14:53,596
that Quark has won
207 straight games of <i>tongo?</i>

313
00:14:53,638 --> 00:14:54,606
So?

314
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,200
So, someone has to beat him.

315
00:14:56,243 --> 00:14:57,472
And that someone is you?

316
00:14:57,513 --> 00:14:58,947
Why not?

317
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:02,182
Well, for one thing,
you can't play <i>tongo.</i>

318
00:15:02,221 --> 00:15:03,519
Confront.

319
00:15:03,558 --> 00:15:06,223
Oh, damn!

320
00:15:06,263 --> 00:15:07,322
Had enough?

321
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:08,925
Not by a long shot.

322
00:15:08,968 --> 00:15:09,958
Miles, at this rate

323
00:15:10,004 --> 00:15:11,495
it's going to take
you another 20 years

324
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:12,839
to be ready to take on Quark.

325
00:15:12,876 --> 00:15:13,969
One more.

326
00:15:14,012 --> 00:15:16,380
Why are you so determined
to beat him?

327
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:17,977
It's the challenge.

328
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:18,988
A challenge?

329
00:15:19,022 --> 00:15:20,685
Isn't it enough?

330
00:15:20,725 --> 00:15:22,752
I mean, why do you think
I became an engineer, huh?

331
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:23,991
The challenge.

332
00:15:24,032 --> 00:15:26,970
What do you think's kept me
kayaking down the same river

333
00:15:27,004 --> 00:15:29,874
week after week
for the last seven years?

334
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,208
The challenge.

335
00:15:31,246 --> 00:15:34,275
Why would I keep playing darts
against somebody

336
00:15:34,352 --> 00:15:37,415
with a genetically engineered
hand/eye coordination, huh?

337
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:38,552
The challenge.

338
00:15:38,595 --> 00:15:40,029
Exactly.

339
00:15:41,366 --> 00:15:44,167
I have to do something
to keep my mind off the fact

340
00:15:44,205 --> 00:15:46,607
that Keiko's been away
for the last six months.

341
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,212
Hold on.

342
00:15:50,251 --> 00:15:52,984
Maybe I can't beat Quark...

343
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,026
but you can.

344
00:15:56,062 --> 00:15:59,330
You and that genetically
engineered brain of yours.

345
00:15:59,402 --> 00:16:01,429
Me? I've only just learned
how to play the game.

346
00:16:01,474 --> 00:16:03,341
Yeah, in about ten seconds flat.

347
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,445
We can do it, Julian.

348
00:16:06,484 --> 00:16:07,452
We can beat him.

349
00:16:07,486 --> 00:16:08,647
"We"?

350
00:16:09,723 --> 00:16:11,386
You're talking about me.

351
00:16:11,426 --> 00:16:13,487
Yeah, well, you're
good at calculation

352
00:16:13,531 --> 00:16:14,863
but a little weak on strategy.

353
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,198
I'll be your coach.

354
00:16:16,236 --> 00:16:17,204
No, thank you.

355
00:16:17,238 --> 00:16:19,140
Think of it as a challenge.

356
00:16:19,175 --> 00:16:21,168
That's your obsession,
Miles, not mine.

357
00:16:21,212 --> 00:16:22,305
Do it for the latinum.

358
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:23,576
Nice try.

359
00:16:23,618 --> 00:16:26,818
Do it for the satisfaction
of the look on Quark's face

360
00:16:26,857 --> 00:16:29,693
when he's beaten
at a game of <i>tongo</i>

361
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,327
by a lowly "hu-man."

362
00:16:32,401 --> 00:16:33,699
Deal the cards.

363
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,483
We are approaching
the Soukara system.

364
00:16:45,528 --> 00:16:47,293
Stand by
to bring us out of warp.

365
00:16:47,331 --> 00:16:49,164
Now.

366
00:16:49,202 --> 00:16:51,365
There is an asteroid
field directly ahead.

367
00:16:51,473 --> 00:16:52,805
That's what we want.

368
00:16:52,843 --> 00:16:55,644
The Dominion's sensor grid
in the system has three gaps

369
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,675
and they're all
in that asteroid field.

370
00:17:02,729 --> 00:17:03,822
Want me to slow down?

371
00:17:03,865 --> 00:17:04,969
No.

372
00:17:05,102 --> 00:17:06,331
Unless you think you should.

373
00:17:06,371 --> 00:17:08,398
Not at all...
in fact, it could go faster.

374
00:17:08,442 --> 00:17:09,968
By all means.

375
00:17:10,012 --> 00:17:12,643
Ooh. A man after my own heart.

376
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,378
Most impressive.

377
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:31,080
Nothing that any
300-year-old pilot couldn't do.

378
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,487
We are being scanned
from the surface.

379
00:17:34,527 --> 00:17:36,258
Taking evasive maneuvers.

380
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:37,766
Did they get a fix on us?

381
00:17:37,801 --> 00:17:39,030
I do not think so.

382
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,504
Good.
We've come too long a way

383
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:41,837
just to get shot down.

384
00:17:41,876 --> 00:17:43,174
If you take the helm

385
00:17:43,212 --> 00:17:46,582
I'll scan the surface
for a landing site.

386
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:49,318
There's the base...

387
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,223
the rendezvous point...

388
00:17:51,261 --> 00:17:53,824
and the Dominion
sensor perimeter.

389
00:17:53,867 --> 00:17:55,769
There's a valley
about 20 kilometers

390
00:17:55,804 --> 00:17:57,467
north of the rendezvous point.

391
00:17:57,507 --> 00:17:59,875
It's a long way to go
on foot in the jungle

392
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,506
but I don't think we can risk

393
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:03,950
taking the ship any closer
to their sensors.

394
00:18:03,987 --> 00:18:05,250
Agreed.

395
00:18:14,808 --> 00:18:17,609
We have less than two days
to reach the rendezvous point.

396
00:18:17,648 --> 00:18:18,911
About ten kilometers a day.

397
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,213
That shouldn't be too bad.

398
00:18:20,252 --> 00:18:21,983
Do not underestimate
the task ahead.

399
00:18:22,023 --> 00:18:24,050
We still have to penetrate
the sensor grid

400
00:18:24,093 --> 00:18:25,653
and avoid the Dominion patrols.

401
00:18:25,697 --> 00:18:26,824
I know.

402
00:18:26,866 --> 00:18:29,132
Find a man in the middle
of an alien jungle

403
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,333
then walk him out
without getting caught.

404
00:18:31,374 --> 00:18:32,342
Piece of cake.

405
00:18:32,443 --> 00:18:33,570
Ready?

406
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,807
After you.

407
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,010
Okay.

408
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:52,949
Go to 25 joules.

409
00:19:00,767 --> 00:19:02,703
25 joules.

410
00:19:05,442 --> 00:19:06,467
Done.

411
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:08,140
That's it... we're linked.

412
00:19:10,486 --> 00:19:12,319
Here. Check my work.

413
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:17,255
Dominion encryption
lockouts bypassed.

414
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,031
Tricorder link
to their sensor grids.

415
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,630
Life signs masked.

416
00:19:20,674 --> 00:19:21,937
Nicely done.

417
00:19:21,976 --> 00:19:23,444
Thank you.

418
00:19:26,651 --> 00:19:30,716
Of course, our tricorders
will be useless from now on.

419
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,921
Well, there you go again

420
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,556
looking for the cloud
in the silver lining.

421
00:19:33,598 --> 00:19:35,363
I am not complaining.

422
00:19:35,402 --> 00:19:38,135
I look forward to walking
through the jungle

423
00:19:38,175 --> 00:19:41,238
without a map
and no idea of what lies ahead.

424
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:44,447
Well, the funny thing is,
you probably are.

425
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:53,401
This is a Ferengi-only game,
gentlemen.

426
00:19:53,438 --> 00:19:54,633
You let Dax play.

427
00:19:54,674 --> 00:19:56,040
She's an exception.

428
00:19:56,077 --> 00:19:58,013
The only exception.

429
00:19:58,048 --> 00:19:59,448
You're afraid
I'll clean you out.

430
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,452
I'm afraid
you'll embarrass yourself

431
00:20:01,521 --> 00:20:02,989
and ruin the game
for the rest us.

432
00:20:03,024 --> 00:20:04,584
I think I can keep up.

433
00:20:04,627 --> 00:20:07,565
The question is:
Can you keep up with me?

434
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,795
Don't try and scare me

435
00:20:08,836 --> 00:20:11,102
with that genetically engineered
intellect of yours, Doctor.

436
00:20:11,141 --> 00:20:13,611
<i>Tongo</i> is more than
just number crunching.

437
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,842
They have yet
to create the computer

438
00:20:15,884 --> 00:20:17,478
that can master this game.

439
00:20:17,553 --> 00:20:19,785
Then you shouldn't have
anything to worry about.

440
00:20:19,825 --> 00:20:21,988
You realize...

441
00:20:22,029 --> 00:20:24,592
we are not playing for drinks.

442
00:20:24,634 --> 00:20:26,934
This is a high-stakes game.

443
00:20:26,972 --> 00:20:29,204
We came to play.

444
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,970
Gentlemen?

445
00:20:35,422 --> 00:20:37,051
All right.

446
00:20:37,092 --> 00:20:40,587
The buy-in is five strips,
and you're dealing.

447
00:20:43,705 --> 00:20:46,370
You better get off
to a fast start.

448
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,643
They won't know what hit them.

449
00:20:54,427 --> 00:20:56,727
Buy at 300, sell at 350.

450
00:20:59,872 --> 00:21:00,840
Ah!

451
00:21:00,874 --> 00:21:02,137
You're a quick study, Doctor.

452
00:21:02,176 --> 00:21:03,303
I'll give you that.

453
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,815
You mean quick for a "hu-man,"
don't you, Quark?

454
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:08,845
I would never say anything
so distasteful during a game.

455
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,519
No, you'd wait
until it was over.

456
00:21:10,592 --> 00:21:12,755
Of course.

457
00:21:12,797 --> 00:21:13,924
Evade.

458
00:21:16,571 --> 00:21:18,062
Dax was a quick study, too.

459
00:21:18,108 --> 00:21:19,542
She told me
it only took her two weeks

460
00:21:19,577 --> 00:21:20,545
to win her first match.

461
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:21,875
That's practically unheard of.

462
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:24,444
Dax specializes
in the unexpected.

463
00:21:24,487 --> 00:21:27,516
Still buying at 300,
selling at four.

464
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,055
I'd like to index
the margin at 20 percent.

465
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,694
Interesting.

466
00:21:32,736 --> 00:21:34,569
She certainly did the unexpected

467
00:21:34,607 --> 00:21:36,543
when she married
Commander Boring.

468
00:21:36,578 --> 00:21:37,546
That's for sure.

469
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,243
When they first started
seeing each other

470
00:21:39,283 --> 00:21:41,048
I thought, "This can't last.

471
00:21:41,087 --> 00:21:44,184
"I'll give it two months."

472
00:21:44,226 --> 00:21:46,594
I'll buy at 400...

473
00:21:46,698 --> 00:21:48,030
and sell at five.

474
00:21:48,068 --> 00:21:49,434
I had the same thought

475
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:52,442
although to tell you the truth,
I only gave it a month.

476
00:21:52,476 --> 00:21:53,603
Confront.

477
00:21:53,678 --> 00:21:55,807
She's a real heartbreaker,
that one.

478
00:21:57,453 --> 00:21:58,751
That she is.

479
00:21:58,788 --> 00:22:01,224
Leverage the buy-in

480
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,457
and sell at 550.

481
00:22:04,734 --> 00:22:06,670
You know...

482
00:22:06,704 --> 00:22:10,474
you go through a lot of ups
and downs in my business.

483
00:22:10,512 --> 00:22:13,143
There are days when
the profits are down

484
00:22:13,184 --> 00:22:15,051
and the customers are scarce

485
00:22:15,088 --> 00:22:19,290
and you think you'll never see
another strip of latinum again

486
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:22,325
and then, Jadzia comes in...

487
00:22:22,369 --> 00:22:25,773
and flashes that smile of hers.

488
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:28,872
Suddenly, things don't
seem so bad after all.

489
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:31,888
I know exactly what you mean.

490
00:22:31,922 --> 00:22:34,621
You know, sometimes
she walks past the Infirmary

491
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,496
and all she has to do is wink,
and somehow, that...

492
00:22:37,533 --> 00:22:39,867
makes my whole day
look a little brighter.

493
00:22:39,905 --> 00:22:43,036
Focus, Julian, focus.

494
00:22:43,078 --> 00:22:44,444
Shh!

495
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,889
I'll, uh, buy that 550, and...

496
00:22:49,925 --> 00:22:52,191
index the exchange at ten.

497
00:22:52,229 --> 00:22:53,663
And now she's married.

498
00:22:53,765 --> 00:22:55,359
Married.

499
00:22:55,402 --> 00:22:57,235
Out of reach.

500
00:22:58,742 --> 00:23:00,803
I'm converting my reserves...

501
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:03,009
and selling at 600.

502
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,256
You know what's really sad?

503
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:08,853
What really keeps me awake
at night?

504
00:23:08,896 --> 00:23:11,868
She's out of reach
because we let her go.

505
00:23:13,538 --> 00:23:16,203
Yes, I suppose so...

506
00:23:16,244 --> 00:23:18,612
but some things
just weren't meant to be.

507
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,218
Evade.

508
00:23:21,254 --> 00:23:22,313
Julian!

509
00:23:22,356 --> 00:23:23,882
Are you sure you want to?

510
00:23:23,926 --> 00:23:24,894
Chief!

511
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:27,091
Please... you know the rules.

512
00:23:27,132 --> 00:23:28,965
No coaching during a round.

513
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,114
You're probably right.

514
00:23:37,753 --> 00:23:40,919
But what if that's
a convenient rationalization?

515
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,591
What if deep down
in our heart of hearts

516
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:46,067
we both know
she's something unique

517
00:23:46,103 --> 00:23:48,335
something
we may never see again...

518
00:23:48,374 --> 00:23:50,207
a chance at true happiness?

519
00:23:50,245 --> 00:23:52,910
And we let her slip
through our fingers.

520
00:23:52,951 --> 00:23:55,684
What if, 50 years from
now, we each look back

521
00:23:55,722 --> 00:23:58,990
and say, "What a fool I was"?

522
00:24:02,369 --> 00:24:05,000
Confront.

523
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:06,373
Doctor?

524
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:07,673
Hmm?

525
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,179
Confront.

526
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,548
Oh.

527
00:24:10,585 --> 00:24:13,455
Sorry. Um...

528
00:24:13,491 --> 00:24:15,393
full consortium.

529
00:24:18,234 --> 00:24:20,831
Total monopoly.

530
00:24:20,872 --> 00:24:22,705
What?

531
00:24:25,815 --> 00:24:28,115
You seem to be out of money.

532
00:24:28,154 --> 00:24:29,452
Miles?

533
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:30,617
Busted.

534
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:33,129
Thanks for the game.

535
00:24:33,164 --> 00:24:34,189
Welcome back anytime.

536
00:24:34,233 --> 00:24:35,258
Wait.

537
00:24:35,302 --> 00:24:38,138
Quark,
did you really mean all that

538
00:24:38,174 --> 00:24:39,734
about Dax...

539
00:24:39,777 --> 00:24:42,213
being my one last chance
for true happiness?

540
00:24:42,249 --> 00:24:45,380
Doctor, you don't expect me

541
00:24:45,422 --> 00:24:49,226
to show you all my cards,
do you?

542
00:24:53,571 --> 00:24:55,097
You lost.

543
00:24:55,141 --> 00:24:56,735
Whatever happened to "we"?

544
00:24:56,777 --> 00:24:58,940
We weren't mooning
over lost love

545
00:24:58,982 --> 00:25:01,545
with a Ferengi holding
a total monopoly.

546
00:25:01,587 --> 00:25:04,423
You mean all that about Dax
was meant to distract me?

547
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,587
Obviously.

548
00:25:05,628 --> 00:25:07,621
I can't believe
I let him get to me.

549
00:25:07,666 --> 00:25:09,157
Ah. Well...

550
00:25:09,203 --> 00:25:10,694
not your fault.

551
00:25:11,707 --> 00:25:13,973
Genetically engineered or not

552
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,879
you're still "hu-man."

553
00:25:17,352 --> 00:25:19,754
I guess.

554
00:25:19,823 --> 00:25:21,314
Let's get a drink.

555
00:26:06,772 --> 00:26:08,765
Ow!

556
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,894
Oh, let's not stand
on pride, shall we?

557
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:10,558
Trills don't like the heat

558
00:27:10,666 --> 00:27:12,727
and Klingons
don't like the cold.

559
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:14,831
There's no shame
in admitting it.

560
00:27:14,874 --> 00:27:16,240
Thank you.

561
00:27:16,278 --> 00:27:18,977
You're welcome.

562
00:27:19,016 --> 00:27:21,350
So, how are you enjoying
your honeymoon?

563
00:27:21,388 --> 00:27:22,879
Are you suffering enough?

564
00:27:22,924 --> 00:27:25,156
Almost.

565
00:27:25,196 --> 00:27:27,428
Is there anything
I can get for you?

566
00:27:28,769 --> 00:27:30,466
More pain.

567
00:27:30,506 --> 00:27:31,838
Less cold.

568
00:27:33,178 --> 00:27:35,512
I don't know why that's funny,
but it is.

569
00:27:37,353 --> 00:27:39,550
Mating call?

570
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:42,222
500 meters.

571
00:27:42,263 --> 00:27:43,458
That way.

572
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:49,201
Well, that didn't take long.

573
00:27:49,244 --> 00:27:51,271
Less than 300 meters.

574
00:27:55,489 --> 00:27:57,516
Another happy couple.

575
00:28:02,135 --> 00:28:04,264
When I was a boy

576
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:06,539
my father used to take
my brother and me

577
00:28:06,578 --> 00:28:08,639
on camping trips
in the Ural Mountains.

578
00:28:10,051 --> 00:28:12,921
Every night, we would
listen to the wolves

579
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:14,620
howling in the distance.

580
00:28:14,661 --> 00:28:17,633
Nikolai was afraid of them

581
00:28:17,667 --> 00:28:21,003
but I would lay in my tent
for hours, just listening.

582
00:28:23,245 --> 00:28:25,545
I remember being seized
by the urge

583
00:28:25,583 --> 00:28:27,314
to just rip off my clothes

584
00:28:27,353 --> 00:28:31,225
and run into the night
and live in the forest

585
00:28:31,261 --> 00:28:33,789
and become something... wild.

586
00:28:40,211 --> 00:28:42,010
He must have been rejected.

587
00:28:42,048 --> 00:28:43,175
He's moving away.

588
00:28:45,923 --> 00:28:47,118
She's not happy.

589
00:28:50,332 --> 00:28:52,598
What? They're getting
further away, aren't they?

590
00:28:52,637 --> 00:28:56,407
Yes, but it is because
something is coming.

591
00:28:57,747 --> 00:28:59,147
And it is close.

592
00:29:58,869 --> 00:30:00,132
Jadzia!

593
00:30:10,426 --> 00:30:11,655
Lie still.

594
00:30:11,695 --> 00:30:13,665
I think I can do that.

595
00:30:16,404 --> 00:30:17,872
Can I have the good news first?

596
00:30:21,013 --> 00:30:23,210
No vital organs were damaged.

597
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:25,083
Oh. Now the bad news?

598
00:30:25,121 --> 00:30:26,146
The disruptor burst

599
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:28,251
left an anticoagulant
in your system.

600
00:30:28,294 --> 00:30:30,822
Oh. So you can't stop
the bleeding.

601
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:32,094
No.

602
00:30:32,135 --> 00:30:35,505
Well, I must not have taken
the whole burst.

603
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:38,241
I'm not hemorrhaging
that bad yet.

604
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,546
Just keep me pumped
full of painkillers

605
00:30:40,586 --> 00:30:42,054
and let's be on our way.

606
00:30:42,088 --> 00:30:43,579
Moving could make
the bleeding worse.

607
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:45,857
Staying here isn't an option.

608
00:30:45,896 --> 00:30:47,695
Someone's going
to come looking for them

609
00:30:47,733 --> 00:30:48,826
when they don't check in

610
00:30:48,869 --> 00:30:51,271
and I'd rather take my chances
on foot.

611
00:30:51,306 --> 00:30:52,365
You ready?

612
00:30:53,945 --> 00:30:55,608
You ready?

613
00:30:55,649 --> 00:30:56,810
Ready.

614
00:30:56,851 --> 00:30:58,377
Yeah. Let's go.

615
00:31:26,478 --> 00:31:29,279
We are still 12 kilometers
from the rendezvous point.

616
00:31:29,316 --> 00:31:31,115
And only 20 hours left.

617
00:31:31,153 --> 00:31:35,093
Well, I guess it's time
we stop having so much fun

618
00:31:35,128 --> 00:31:37,189
and pick up the pace, huh?

619
00:31:37,232 --> 00:31:38,861
Oh, more plasma.

620
00:31:38,902 --> 00:31:41,065
No, thanks. I'm full.

621
00:31:41,106 --> 00:31:44,078
Your blood pressure
has dropped another 20 percent.

622
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:46,207
Love that bedside manner.

623
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,847
You know, you should
have been a doctor?

624
00:31:51,794 --> 00:31:55,325
Your bandage will need
to be changed soon.

625
00:31:55,368 --> 00:31:59,935
You know, I think I'd like a
blue chiffon bandage this time.

626
00:32:00,044 --> 00:32:02,071
Maybe some rhinestones.

627
00:32:02,115 --> 00:32:03,709
Something with a little pizzazz.

628
00:32:03,752 --> 00:32:05,688
This is no joking matter.

629
00:32:05,722 --> 00:32:06,690
You are seriously injured

630
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:08,489
and we have a great deal
of terrain to cover.

631
00:32:08,528 --> 00:32:11,227
Just trying to lighten the mood.

632
00:32:11,266 --> 00:32:13,634
This is neither the time
nor the place.

633
00:32:13,672 --> 00:32:15,574
What happened to that new Worf?

634
00:32:15,609 --> 00:32:18,137
You know, the one
with the sense of humor?

635
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,708
That was a mistake.

636
00:32:20,752 --> 00:32:22,722
Oh, what is that supposed
to mean?

637
00:32:22,756 --> 00:32:24,555
It means, if I had not
been joking with you

638
00:32:24,594 --> 00:32:26,154
I would not have allowed
the Jem'Hadar

639
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:27,859
to get so close.

640
00:32:29,169 --> 00:32:30,866
So, this is all my fault.

641
00:32:30,906 --> 00:32:32,340
No.

642
00:32:32,375 --> 00:32:33,775
It is mine.

643
00:32:33,812 --> 00:32:36,409
I was trying to be
something I am not.

644
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:39,650
By letting down my guard,
by ignoring my duty

645
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:41,421
I allowed my wife to be injured

646
00:32:41,461 --> 00:32:43,761
and I put the entire
mission in jeopardy.

647
00:32:43,798 --> 00:32:46,234
That will not happen again.

648
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,833
That's not what happened.

649
00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:51,368
Without our tricorders,
there's no way...

650
00:32:51,413 --> 00:32:53,406
I do not wish to debate this.

651
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,790
We have a long way to go
and very little time.

652
00:32:57,826 --> 00:32:59,887
Fine. Let's go.

653
00:33:36,771 --> 00:33:38,866
Ready?

654
00:34:25,702 --> 00:34:27,296
Hypo.

655
00:34:37,458 --> 00:34:40,989
Oh, there.
Good as new.

656
00:34:46,309 --> 00:34:48,438
I have to change your dressing.

657
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,350
That's four bandages
in two hours.

658
00:34:51,386 --> 00:34:53,949
That has got to be
some kind of record.

659
00:34:53,992 --> 00:34:55,723
Oh, sorry.

660
00:34:55,762 --> 00:34:57,322
Forgot the new rules.

661
00:34:57,365 --> 00:34:58,833
Nothing funny.

662
00:34:58,868 --> 00:35:00,200
Got to be serious.

663
00:35:00,237 --> 00:35:01,831
Life and death.

664
00:35:01,874 --> 00:35:04,208
We've got a job to do.

665
00:35:07,218 --> 00:35:10,054
Jadzia, I know you are tired

666
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:11,855
but we have to cover
three kilometers

667
00:35:11,894 --> 00:35:12,862
before nightfall.

668
00:35:12,896 --> 00:35:14,194
Can you do it?

669
00:35:14,232 --> 00:35:17,068
As long as you got
those painkillers

670
00:35:17,138 --> 00:35:19,574
I'll follow you through
the gates of hell, sir.

671
00:35:21,146 --> 00:35:22,341
Hmm.

672
00:35:22,381 --> 00:35:25,581
Oh, that was almost a smile.

673
00:35:28,962 --> 00:35:33,027
When this mission is over,
I will smile all you want.

674
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,937
Oh, you promise?

675
00:35:34,974 --> 00:35:37,206
I promise.

676
00:35:37,244 --> 00:35:41,356
Then let's finish this mission
and get out of here.

677
00:35:44,897 --> 00:35:47,460
Whoa. Oh!

678
00:35:47,535 --> 00:35:49,198
That's all right.
I can stand.

679
00:35:49,238 --> 00:35:50,467
Just help me get my balance.

680
00:35:50,507 --> 00:35:51,998
Help me balance.

681
00:35:53,013 --> 00:35:54,949
Or maybe not.

682
00:36:10,247 --> 00:36:11,978
Let me guess.

683
00:36:12,017 --> 00:36:13,884
Things aren't looking up.

684
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:16,357
There's been another drop
in your blood pressure.

685
00:36:16,392 --> 00:36:18,453
And your neural EDL readings
are erratic.

686
00:36:18,563 --> 00:36:21,899
So what's your prescription,
Doc?

687
00:36:21,937 --> 00:36:25,570
Surgery... at a starbase.

688
00:36:25,611 --> 00:36:28,344
Could I get a second opinion?

689
00:36:35,063 --> 00:36:39,026
Worf, you have to go on
without me...

690
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:40,904
and I know that.

691
00:36:40,942 --> 00:36:42,502
I understand.

692
00:36:42,578 --> 00:36:45,048
My duty requires
that I complete the mission

693
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:47,076
regardless
of my personal feelings.

694
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,647
Absolutely.

695
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:50,319
You're a Starfleet officer.

696
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:53,423
So am I, and I understand.

697
00:36:53,466 --> 00:36:55,459
The information
Lasaran has could be

698
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:57,804
potentially invaluable
to the war effort.

699
00:36:57,842 --> 00:37:01,008
You don't have to explain to me.

700
00:37:01,049 --> 00:37:03,178
I'm hurt. You're not.

701
00:37:03,219 --> 00:37:06,089
And there's a job to be done.

702
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:07,754
I will be back tomorrow night.

703
00:37:09,565 --> 00:37:11,033
Don't worry.

704
00:37:11,069 --> 00:37:12,834
I'm not going anywhere.

705
00:37:12,872 --> 00:37:15,240
I can have you
in the stasis chamber

706
00:37:15,277 --> 00:37:17,247
on the runabout in 45 hours.

707
00:37:18,416 --> 00:37:20,409
No problem.

708
00:37:20,454 --> 00:37:21,922
I will leave the medkit.

709
00:37:21,957 --> 00:37:25,225
Scan yourself with the tricorder
every half hour.

710
00:37:25,263 --> 00:37:27,290
The plasma hypospray
will be set...

711
00:37:27,334 --> 00:37:29,304
I took basic first aid.

712
00:37:29,338 --> 00:37:31,433
I know what I have to do.

713
00:37:35,617 --> 00:37:37,348
Worf.

714
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:41,726
It's been a great two months,
hasn't it?

715
00:37:44,735 --> 00:37:46,364
Yes.

716
00:37:49,278 --> 00:37:53,685
Jadzia, I just want
to tell you how...

717
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,088
Just kiss me and go.

718
00:39:43,072 --> 00:39:44,974
What's the word?

719
00:39:48,383 --> 00:39:50,615
She is still in surgery

720
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:52,647
but Dr. Bashir is hopeful
she will make

721
00:39:52,691 --> 00:39:54,661
a full recovery.

722
00:39:54,695 --> 00:39:56,186
Lasaran's dead.

723
00:39:56,232 --> 00:39:58,702
Starfleet Intelligence
intercepted a transmission

724
00:39:58,736 --> 00:39:59,931
saying that he'd been killed

725
00:39:59,973 --> 00:40:02,034
trying to reenter
the base at Soukara.

726
00:40:02,077 --> 00:40:04,547
Could you have made
the rendezvous?

727
00:40:04,581 --> 00:40:06,072
Yes.

728
00:40:06,118 --> 00:40:08,111
But yet you turned
back to save Jadzia.

729
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:09,351
Yes.

730
00:40:09,391 --> 00:40:11,919
Were you aware that the
information that man had

731
00:40:11,964 --> 00:40:13,797
could have saved
millions of lives?

732
00:40:14,835 --> 00:40:15,894
Yes.

733
00:40:15,938 --> 00:40:17,464
So what happened?

734
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,573
You may not understand.

735
00:40:20,613 --> 00:40:21,706
Try me, sir.

736
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:26,320
You were at my wedding.

737
00:40:26,359 --> 00:40:28,625
You heard the story
of the first two Klingon hearts

738
00:40:28,663 --> 00:40:30,462
and how nothing
could stand against them

739
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,063
and how they even destroyed
the gods that had created them.

740
00:40:34,508 --> 00:40:37,001
I have heard that story
since I was a boy

741
00:40:37,047 --> 00:40:41,682
but I never understood it...
I mean really understood it...

742
00:40:41,722 --> 00:40:43,783
until I was standing
in the jungle

743
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,989
with my heart pounding
in my chest

744
00:40:46,032 --> 00:40:49,527
and I found that even I could
not stand against my own heart.

745
00:40:49,571 --> 00:40:52,202
I had to go back

746
00:40:52,244 --> 00:40:54,441
and it did not matter
what Starfleet thought

747
00:40:54,481 --> 00:40:56,041
or what the consequences were.

748
00:40:56,085 --> 00:40:59,820
She was my wife,
and I could not leave her.

749
00:40:59,858 --> 00:41:03,297
As your Captain,
it is my duty to inform you

750
00:41:03,332 --> 00:41:05,734
that you made the wrong choice.

751
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:10,303
I don't think Starfleet
will file any formal charges.

752
00:41:10,346 --> 00:41:12,782
Even a secret court-martial
would run the risk

753
00:41:12,851 --> 00:41:16,153
of revealing too much about
their intelligence operations.

754
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,959
But this will go
into your service record.

755
00:41:21,302 --> 00:41:24,001
And to be completely honest

756
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:29,040
you probably won't be offered a
command on your own after this.

757
00:41:29,084 --> 00:41:31,681
I understand.

758
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:33,988
I've also issued new orders.

759
00:41:34,027 --> 00:41:36,726
You and Jadzia are not
to be assigned to a mission

760
00:41:36,765 --> 00:41:38,564
on your own ever again.

761
00:41:43,379 --> 00:41:45,372
And one last thing.

762
00:41:46,418 --> 00:41:48,888
As a man who had a wife...

763
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:54,359
if Jennifer had been
lying in that clearing...

764
00:41:54,401 --> 00:41:57,237
I wouldn't have left her either.

765
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,860
Hey.

766
00:42:26,966 --> 00:42:29,061
I know you.

767
00:42:29,104 --> 00:42:31,131
We have met.

768
00:42:31,175 --> 00:42:33,874
Ah, you're joking again.

769
00:42:33,913 --> 00:42:36,042
That's a good sign.

770
00:42:36,085 --> 00:42:39,251
Did you make the rendezvous?

771
00:42:39,291 --> 00:42:41,454
No.

772
00:42:43,399 --> 00:42:46,337
I could not leave you there.

773
00:42:46,372 --> 00:42:49,538
Not for Lasaran,
not for the mission

774
00:42:49,578 --> 00:42:51,514
not for anything else.

775
00:42:51,548 --> 00:42:53,039
Lasaran?

776
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,018
Dead.

777
00:42:56,057 --> 00:42:58,722
Are you in trouble?

778
00:42:58,763 --> 00:43:01,233
I have been in trouble before.

779
00:43:01,268 --> 00:43:03,431
I'm sorry.

780
00:43:03,472 --> 00:43:06,205
I should have kept going.

781
00:43:06,245 --> 00:43:08,808
You have nothing
to be sorry about.

782
00:43:10,253 --> 00:43:13,657
I know how much
your career means to you.

783
00:43:13,693 --> 00:43:15,629
You come first...

784
00:43:15,663 --> 00:43:19,763
before career, before duty,
before anything.

785
00:43:21,275 --> 00:43:23,336
I do not regret what I did...

786
00:43:24,681 --> 00:43:26,241
and I would do it again.

787
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:32,093
I don't know what to say.

788
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:36,264
You could say,
"Thank you for saving my life."

789
00:43:38,275 --> 00:43:40,940
Thank you for saving my life.

790
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,278
And you could say

791
00:43:42,317 --> 00:43:44,948
"I would do the same
for you, Worf."

792
00:43:44,988 --> 00:43:49,623
Well... I'd have
to think about that.

793
00:43:49,664 --> 00:43:53,399
Well, my career is very
important to me, you know.

794
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,277
And you could say, "I love you."

795
00:44:03,692 --> 00:44:06,664
I love you.

796
00:44:06,698 --> 00:44:08,691
And I love you.
