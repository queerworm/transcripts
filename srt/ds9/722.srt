1
00:00:13,391 --> 00:00:15,054
There, right there.

2
00:00:15,094 --> 00:00:16,188
The explosion began

3
00:00:16,231 --> 00:00:17,757
at the intercooler matrix

4
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:19,704
and your men were supposed
to plant the bomb

5
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:22,210
here at the secondary
plasma relay.

6
00:00:22,278 --> 00:00:23,747
What difference does it make?

7
00:00:23,782 --> 00:00:25,149
The ship was destroyed.

8
00:00:25,185 --> 00:00:28,124
The intercooler was
the obvious choice for sabotage.

9
00:00:28,159 --> 00:00:30,027
Their security checks
could have found the bomb

10
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:32,160
and disarmed it before
the ship left orbit.

11
00:00:32,202 --> 00:00:33,762
But they didn't find it.

12
00:00:33,806 --> 00:00:35,366
That isn't the point.

13
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,073
Your men ignored
their instructions

14
00:00:37,114 --> 00:00:38,082
and their training.

15
00:00:38,116 --> 00:00:40,451
Let us not lose
sight of the fact

16
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:42,517
that the mission was a success.

17
00:00:42,561 --> 00:00:43,928
It was a success

18
00:00:43,963 --> 00:00:47,267
because the Jem'Hadar security
slipped up and we got lucky.

19
00:00:47,305 --> 00:00:48,604
Don't use those men again

20
00:00:48,641 --> 00:00:50,612
for anything other than
routine reconnaissance.

21
00:00:50,646 --> 00:00:52,480
They're five of my best men.

22
00:00:52,517 --> 00:00:54,647
Bronok is one
of the most experienced...

23
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:57,287
You've been told before...
no names.

24
00:00:57,362 --> 00:01:00,028
Each cell has to be insulated

25
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:01,629
from the cell above
and the cell below.

26
00:01:01,672 --> 00:01:03,472
If I know the names of your men

27
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:04,639
and I am captured...

28
00:01:04,679 --> 00:01:07,014
Yes, I've heard the lecture.

29
00:01:07,052 --> 00:01:09,250
Well, then you shouldn't
have to be reminded.

30
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:12,958
It's been a long day.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,994
Why don't we take a break?

32
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,078
Good idea.

33
00:01:19,115 --> 00:01:21,552
The air in here
is getting stale.

34
00:01:24,594 --> 00:01:27,396
You going to do
something about him?

35
00:01:27,434 --> 00:01:29,063
I am.

36
00:01:29,105 --> 00:01:30,973
I'm giving him my support.

37
00:01:32,346 --> 00:01:34,214
All right.

38
00:01:36,924 --> 00:01:38,518
This does not bode well.

39
00:01:40,332 --> 00:01:41,699
Odo.

40
00:01:44,275 --> 00:01:46,610
The raid on the Tevak
shipyard was successful.

41
00:01:46,647 --> 00:01:49,016
I penetrated
the Operations Center

42
00:01:49,052 --> 00:01:50,715
disabled
the security protocols.

43
00:01:50,757 --> 00:01:55,963
The rest of the team sabotaged
the dilithium storage bunkers.

44
00:01:56,003 --> 00:01:59,774
An hour after we left, the
entire facility was vaporized.

45
00:01:59,812 --> 00:02:02,147
You should get some rest.

46
00:02:02,184 --> 00:02:03,653
That sounds good to me.

47
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:05,157
Anyone in the bunk room?

48
00:02:06,261 --> 00:02:07,320
No.

49
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,329
Okay, it's all yours.

50
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:09,595
Right.

51
00:02:09,635 --> 00:02:12,267
Odo.

52
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:13,835
Good work.

53
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:16,282
Thank you.

54
00:02:44,051 --> 00:02:45,885
Huh?

55
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:51,568
It's just like you

56
00:02:51,603 --> 00:02:54,873
to come sneaking in here
without warning.

57
00:02:54,911 --> 00:02:58,078
My approach may have been quiet,
but I assure you

58
00:02:58,118 --> 00:03:00,852
I had no intention
of sneaking up on you.

59
00:03:00,892 --> 00:03:02,623
My apologies.

60
00:03:03,999 --> 00:03:07,029
Lf... I may ask...

61
00:03:07,074 --> 00:03:09,409
Why...

62
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:13,581
have I deteriorated
so rapidly?

63
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:19,597
I've been assuming
dozens of different forms

64
00:03:19,636 --> 00:03:22,473
over the... past few weeks.

65
00:03:24,348 --> 00:03:26,980
Changing shape seems to...

66
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:30,552
accelerate the progress
of the disease.

67
00:03:30,596 --> 00:03:32,590
Perhaps you should stop.

68
00:03:32,634 --> 00:03:34,798
And do what?

69
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:38,280
Lie here waiting to die?

70
00:03:38,314 --> 00:03:39,282
I came to work.

71
00:03:39,317 --> 00:03:41,288
Work is what I'm going to do.

72
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:45,388
I take it Commander Kira is
unaware of your true condition.

73
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:46,559
That's right.

74
00:03:48,005 --> 00:03:50,876
And I prefer
that it stays that way.

75
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,506
I won't breathe a word.

76
00:03:52,582 --> 00:03:54,176
See that you don't.

77
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:57,990
She has enough
on her mind without...

78
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,262
worrying about me.

79
00:04:00,301 --> 00:04:02,363
And I...

80
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:07,944
don't want... her...

81
00:04:07,986 --> 00:04:09,285
Pity?

82
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,601
Is there a reason
you came in here?

83
00:04:15,637 --> 00:04:18,474
We have need of a contact
on Kelvas V.

84
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,173
I remember your telling
me that you knew...

85
00:04:20,215 --> 00:04:23,086
I may have a few names for you.

86
00:04:23,122 --> 00:04:25,686
I have to give it some thought.

87
00:04:35,051 --> 00:04:37,990
Odo, I hope you know
how much I...

88
00:04:38,025 --> 00:04:40,896
If I don't want pity
from the woman I love

89
00:04:40,932 --> 00:04:43,700
why would I want it from you?

90
00:07:01,571 --> 00:07:02,630
Morning.

91
00:07:02,674 --> 00:07:04,041
Oh. What time is it?

92
00:07:04,111 --> 00:07:06,014
0630.

93
00:07:06,049 --> 00:07:08,179
Another all-nighter.

94
00:07:08,221 --> 00:07:09,815
That's four in a row.

95
00:07:09,858 --> 00:07:11,658
You can't keep this up.

96
00:07:11,696 --> 00:07:13,599
I'm beginning
to agree with you.

97
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:17,438
And, to add insult to injury,
I'm not getting anywhere.

98
00:07:17,477 --> 00:07:20,918
My DNA integration theory's
a blind alley.

99
00:07:20,951 --> 00:07:22,420
So where does that leave you?

100
00:07:22,455 --> 00:07:24,392
Back on square one.

101
00:07:24,426 --> 00:07:26,055
Whoever engineered
this shape-shifter virus

102
00:07:26,097 --> 00:07:28,661
certainly did a good job
of covering their tracks.

103
00:07:28,703 --> 00:07:31,801
Julian, it's time to face facts.

104
00:07:31,844 --> 00:07:33,438
You're not going
to pull a rabbit

105
00:07:33,481 --> 00:07:34,745
out of your medkit.

106
00:07:34,785 --> 00:07:37,656
Now, even the Founders
themselves couldn't find a cure

107
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:38,887
and they had all the resources

108
00:07:38,928 --> 00:07:40,261
of the Dominion
at their command.

109
00:07:40,298 --> 00:07:42,029
Now, I know you don't
want to hear this...

110
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,400
but the only way
we're going to find a cure

111
00:07:45,443 --> 00:07:48,143
is to track down whoever created
this thing in the first place.

112
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,051
Miles...

113
00:07:50,087 --> 00:07:53,391
We have got to find a way
to get inside Section 31.

114
00:07:53,429 --> 00:07:54,659
We've tried that.

115
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:56,636
We've tried and we've tried

116
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,766
and all we managed to do
was waste two weeks

117
00:07:58,808 --> 00:08:00,608
chasing phantoms
from here to Vulcan.

118
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:01,979
You want to face facts?

119
00:08:02,016 --> 00:08:02,984
Face this fact:

120
00:08:03,018 --> 00:08:05,251
Section 31 have managed
to stay in hiding

121
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:07,352
for over 300 years.

122
00:08:07,395 --> 00:08:09,730
They're not going to come
scurrying into the light

123
00:08:09,768 --> 00:08:11,864
just because Miles O'Brien
and Julian Bashir

124
00:08:11,907 --> 00:08:13,240
are on the case.

125
00:08:13,277 --> 00:08:15,544
Which is why I still say

126
00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:17,780
we should take this
to Captain Sisko

127
00:08:17,821 --> 00:08:19,985
and let him contact
Starfleet Intelligence.

128
00:08:20,026 --> 00:08:21,085
Maybe they can...

129
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:22,860
All that will do
is alert Section 31

130
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,563
to the fact
that we're on to them.

131
00:08:24,603 --> 00:08:26,163
And you know what they'll do?

132
00:08:26,275 --> 00:08:27,666
They'll go deeper into hiding...

133
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:28,961
probably send someone here

134
00:08:29,002 --> 00:08:30,973
to destroy
whatever headway I've made.

135
00:08:31,006 --> 00:08:32,065
No.

136
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,377
No more cloak and dagger games.

137
00:08:34,415 --> 00:08:36,112
Science is the answer here.

138
00:08:36,153 --> 00:08:38,785
Every puzzle has a solution,
every disease a cure.

139
00:08:38,825 --> 00:08:41,023
It's just a matter
of finding it.

140
00:08:41,064 --> 00:08:43,969
Now, if you'll kindly get
the hell out of here

141
00:08:44,005 --> 00:08:45,668
I have work to do.

142
00:08:53,861 --> 00:08:57,233
Martok's attack on Avenal VII
was a disgrace.

143
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,774
He had the advantage
of surprise.

144
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:02,783
The Dominion wasn't expecting us
to take the offensive

145
00:09:02,817 --> 00:09:05,881
so soon after the Breen
entered the war.

146
00:09:05,924 --> 00:09:10,367
Avenal should've been
an easy victory for him

147
00:09:10,401 --> 00:09:14,434
but instead, he's handed
us a shameful defeat.

148
00:09:14,477 --> 00:09:17,006
General Martok and I
both advised you

149
00:09:17,051 --> 00:09:18,418
against attacking a world

150
00:09:18,454 --> 00:09:20,687
so deep inside
Dominion territory.

151
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,893
He was outnumbered
six-to-one at Avenal.

152
00:09:23,933 --> 00:09:25,232
Six-to-one.

153
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,639
A good Commander finds ways
to beat the odds

154
00:09:27,676 --> 00:09:29,168
not hide behind them.

155
00:09:29,213 --> 00:09:31,013
He didn't hide behind anything.

156
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,251
He fought longer and harder
than I would have in his place.

157
00:09:34,292 --> 00:09:37,231
Have you read Worf's
after-action report?

158
00:09:38,268 --> 00:09:40,068
Seven Klingon ships destroyed.

159
00:09:40,106 --> 00:09:42,009
Five others severely damaged.

160
00:09:42,044 --> 00:09:44,140
General Martok himself
in critical condition

161
00:09:44,182 --> 00:09:45,811
in the <i>Rotarran</i> Sick Bay.

162
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:48,451
He's expected to survive.

163
00:09:48,493 --> 00:09:50,156
That's not the point!

164
00:09:50,196 --> 00:09:52,167
This entire operation has been

165
00:09:52,201 --> 00:09:55,072
a waste of resources,
men and equipment.

166
00:09:55,108 --> 00:09:56,076
The blame lies with the man

167
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,670
who ordered the mission
in the first place

168
00:09:57,715 --> 00:09:59,948
not the man who tried
to carry it out.

169
00:10:07,371 --> 00:10:10,868
That's one of the things
I like about you, Captain...

170
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,614
your loyalty to your friends.

171
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:19,497
This has nothing to do
with loyalty.

172
00:10:19,533 --> 00:10:21,834
Of course not.

173
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:28,511
In any case, you needn't worry.

174
00:10:28,555 --> 00:10:30,617
Martok's a popular
General with the troops

175
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,129
and that counts for something.

176
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:33,827
I won't relieve him
of command...

177
00:10:35,438 --> 00:10:36,907
yet.

178
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:51,633
As you can see, the Klingon raid
on Avenal was easily broken up.

179
00:10:51,677 --> 00:10:54,582
I am less concerned
about this Klingon attack

180
00:10:54,617 --> 00:10:57,146
than I am
the Cardassian rebellion.

181
00:10:57,191 --> 00:10:59,891
We cannot fight
the combined forces

182
00:10:59,931 --> 00:11:03,394
of the Federation, the Klingons
and the Romulans

183
00:11:03,506 --> 00:11:05,409
and face a full-scale uprising

184
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,945
behind the lines.

185
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,415
I completely agree.

186
00:11:08,485 --> 00:11:10,649
However, the situation
is well in hand.

187
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:13,254
We still have control
over the Cardassian military

188
00:11:13,295 --> 00:11:16,633
while Damar has only a handful
of terrorists at his disposal.

189
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,641
I assure you both

190
00:11:18,675 --> 00:11:22,207
that this rebellion
poses no threat.

191
00:11:23,687 --> 00:11:27,629
You are correct,
and you also assured us

192
00:11:27,663 --> 00:11:31,297
that Damar would never turn
against the Dominion.

193
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:33,674
That was...

194
00:11:33,711 --> 00:11:36,878
an error, to be sure,
but an understandable one.

195
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:38,286
No one could have foreseen

196
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,190
that Damar would become
a terrorist.

197
00:11:40,227 --> 00:11:43,599
The concept is antithetical
to the very nature

198
00:11:43,635 --> 00:11:44,660
of Cardassians.

199
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,832
They respect authority.

200
00:11:45,874 --> 00:11:48,403
They value the rule of law
and the security of order

201
00:11:48,446 --> 00:11:51,214
which is exactly
what the Dominion offers them.

202
00:11:52,423 --> 00:11:53,790
Exactly.

203
00:11:53,826 --> 00:11:56,822
If our cloning facilities
were operational

204
00:11:56,866 --> 00:11:59,532
I would eliminate
this Weyoun immediately.

205
00:11:59,573 --> 00:12:04,415
Damar must pay
the price for his treason.

206
00:12:04,452 --> 00:12:08,018
Redouble your efforts
to find his wife and children

207
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,056
and I want you to begin
interrogating Cardassian

208
00:12:11,101 --> 00:12:14,268
teachers, scientists,
local officials.

209
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:18,251
The population must understand,
in no uncertain terms

210
00:12:18,285 --> 00:12:21,349
that dissent
will not be tolerated.

211
00:12:21,392 --> 00:12:23,123
Then I want you to begin

212
00:12:23,163 --> 00:12:26,501
putting Cardassian civilians
in and around

213
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:29,534
the Dominion
military installations.

214
00:12:29,578 --> 00:12:33,918
If Damar destroys another
shipyard, he will have to kill

215
00:12:33,955 --> 00:12:37,225
a great many
of his own countrymen as well.

216
00:12:37,264 --> 00:12:40,169
This will help turn the people
against him.

217
00:12:40,204 --> 00:12:42,904
An excellent plan.

218
00:12:42,944 --> 00:12:46,248
Your opinion was not solicited.

219
00:12:48,557 --> 00:12:51,189
Thot Pran,
the sooner we can regain

220
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,701
the offensive on the front
lines, the better.

221
00:12:53,737 --> 00:12:57,109
The installation of the Breen
weapons on the Dominion ships

222
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:59,308
must be accelerated.

223
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:03,520
Please issue the appropriate
orders to your engineers.

224
00:13:11,044 --> 00:13:13,881
How long before
our cloning facilities

225
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,547
are operational again?

226
00:13:15,588 --> 00:13:20,362
Not for several days,
perhaps even weeks.

227
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,394
Ah.

228
00:13:22,439 --> 00:13:24,535
Well, keep me informed.

229
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:34,556
And according to our new
contact on Kelvas V

230
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:37,506
the Breen will begin to install
their energy-dampening weapons

231
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:40,241
aboard Jem'Hadar fighters
within a week.

232
00:13:40,281 --> 00:13:42,046
Has the Federation
made any progress

233
00:13:42,085 --> 00:13:43,611
in counteracting these weapons?

234
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,593
No. They're still having trouble

235
00:13:45,627 --> 00:13:48,121
understanding
the underlying technology.

236
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:50,138
Well, why aren't
the Klingon ships

237
00:13:50,172 --> 00:13:52,040
affected by these Breen weapons?

238
00:13:52,076 --> 00:13:53,670
We don't know that yet either

239
00:13:53,747 --> 00:13:57,210
but, if we could supply
the Federation with one

240
00:13:57,256 --> 00:13:58,246
it would give them a chance

241
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,590
to come up with
a countermeasure.

242
00:13:59,628 --> 00:14:00,995
I had the same thought.

243
00:14:01,031 --> 00:14:02,728
Our priority should be
to free Cardassia

244
00:14:02,768 --> 00:14:05,171
from the Dominion,
not do Starfleet's dirty work.

245
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,645
We're all in this together.

246
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,742
By helping Starfleet,
we're helping ourselves.

247
00:14:09,785 --> 00:14:11,118
There's a Cardassian

248
00:14:11,155 --> 00:14:13,217
repair facility
in the Kelvas system, right?

249
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,319
Yes.

250
00:14:14,362 --> 00:14:16,663
I take it you have
something in mind.

251
00:14:16,735 --> 00:14:18,933
It won't be easy, but...

252
00:14:18,974 --> 00:14:21,207
if we can get onto the Bridge...

253
00:14:23,384 --> 00:14:25,821
All right, we'll take
a five-man team...

254
00:14:25,857 --> 00:14:27,349
the four of us plus Odo.

255
00:14:27,394 --> 00:14:28,488
Garak, I'm going to need

256
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:30,660
everything you have
on the Kelvas facility.

257
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:33,471
Is something wrong?

258
00:14:33,508 --> 00:14:35,502
Possibly.

259
00:14:35,547 --> 00:14:37,984
Uh, may I have a few words
with the Commander?

260
00:14:47,943 --> 00:14:49,105
What's on your mind?

261
00:14:49,146 --> 00:14:51,379
It's about taking Odo
on this mission.

262
00:14:52,554 --> 00:14:56,188
I'm afraid there's no easy way
of putting it.

263
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:59,067
He's been hiding the true extent
of his illness

264
00:14:59,103 --> 00:15:01,199
from you for some time now.

265
00:15:01,242 --> 00:15:04,044
His condition has
severely deteriorated

266
00:15:04,082 --> 00:15:06,053
and the more he changes form...

267
00:15:06,087 --> 00:15:08,651
the worse he gets.

268
00:15:08,693 --> 00:15:09,992
I know.

269
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:11,829
You do?

270
00:15:11,867 --> 00:15:13,336
I love him, Garak.

271
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:15,274
You think I really
wouldn't notice?

272
00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:16,938
Why the pretense?

273
00:15:16,979 --> 00:15:18,573
Because I also know

274
00:15:18,616 --> 00:15:21,316
that he doesn't want me
to find out about it.

275
00:15:21,356 --> 00:15:23,121
He wants to put up a brave front

276
00:15:23,161 --> 00:15:25,530
and protect me
from the truth, well, fine.

277
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:28,164
If that's what makes
this easier for him

278
00:15:28,297 --> 00:15:32,136
if that gives him one last shred
of dignity to hold onto

279
00:15:32,173 --> 00:15:35,511
then I'll go on ignoring
what's happening to him

280
00:15:35,548 --> 00:15:36,949
until the very end.

281
00:15:39,223 --> 00:15:41,194
Anything else?

282
00:15:41,228 --> 00:15:43,096
No.

283
00:15:43,133 --> 00:15:45,036
All right.

284
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,634
We will need
a Cardassian shuttle

285
00:15:47,677 --> 00:15:49,203
with the latest
security protocols.

286
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,978
And a schematic of the...

287
00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:20,911
Sisko to Worf.

288
00:16:20,956 --> 00:16:22,482
Worf here.

289
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,691
I'd like to see you
in my office, Commander.

290
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,293
On my way.

291
00:16:36,127 --> 00:16:37,824
How's Martok?

292
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:40,496
Dr. Bashir says
he will make a full recovery.

293
00:16:40,537 --> 00:16:43,408
I'm glad to hear that.

294
00:16:43,477 --> 00:16:49,151
Mr. Worf, we've got
a serious problem on our hands.

295
00:16:49,191 --> 00:16:50,524
Gowron.

296
00:16:50,561 --> 00:16:52,121
He seems hell-bent

297
00:16:52,165 --> 00:16:55,104
on continuing these offensives
regardless of the cost.

298
00:16:55,138 --> 00:16:57,439
He is a stubborn
and arrogant man.

299
00:16:57,545 --> 00:17:00,313
That may be true,
but I hope he's not a fool.

300
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,914
He's risking
the entire defense posture.

301
00:17:02,957 --> 00:17:04,392
Why can't he see that?

302
00:17:04,461 --> 00:17:08,300
I suspect the Chancellor cannot
see anything at the moment

303
00:17:08,337 --> 00:17:09,305
except for one man.

304
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:10,433
You mean, Martok?

305
00:17:11,946 --> 00:17:14,417
The Chancellor sees him
as a political threat.

306
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:16,752
These attacks
against the Dominion

307
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,693
are designed
to humiliate the General

308
00:17:18,728 --> 00:17:20,197
in the eyes of the Empire...

309
00:17:20,232 --> 00:17:23,832
to force him to endure
defeat after defeat.

310
00:17:23,874 --> 00:17:27,406
Are you telling me that this
is a political vendetta?

311
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:30,286
It would not be the first time
that a Klingon Chancellor

312
00:17:30,322 --> 00:17:33,090
put his own interests
ahead of the greater good.

313
00:17:39,946 --> 00:17:41,780
Something has to be done.

314
00:17:41,816 --> 00:17:43,445
Agreed.

315
00:17:43,488 --> 00:17:48,228
And I do have a solution,
but it will not be easy.

316
00:17:48,265 --> 00:17:51,067
You do whatever it takes,
Mr. Worf.

317
00:17:51,105 --> 00:17:53,839
Those Klingon ships out there

318
00:17:53,879 --> 00:17:56,681
are the only thing
between us and the Breen.

319
00:17:56,719 --> 00:18:00,957
Gowron is risking the safety
of the entire Alpha Quadrant

320
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,659
and he has to stop.

321
00:18:04,137 --> 00:18:05,299
Understood.

322
00:18:12,457 --> 00:18:14,257
My men have secured the shuttle.

323
00:18:14,295 --> 00:18:15,889
They'll meet us
at those coordinates.

324
00:18:17,937 --> 00:18:19,634
Good.

325
00:18:19,674 --> 00:18:21,200
Are you enjoying yourself?

326
00:18:21,245 --> 00:18:23,614
Getting Cardassians
to do your bidding

327
00:18:23,651 --> 00:18:25,451
must give you great pleasure.

328
00:18:25,489 --> 00:18:27,152
I'm a little busy right now,
Rusot.

329
00:18:27,192 --> 00:18:29,390
Why don't you find
someone else to play with?

330
00:18:29,431 --> 00:18:31,196
You may have fooled Damar

331
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:33,400
into believing you're here
to fight the Dominion

332
00:18:33,441 --> 00:18:35,070
but I know
why you're really here.

333
00:18:35,111 --> 00:18:36,478
Oh, this should be good.

334
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:38,645
You killed hundreds
of Cardassians

335
00:18:38,687 --> 00:18:39,655
during the occupation

336
00:18:39,689 --> 00:18:42,321
and now you're getting
a chance to do it again.

337
00:18:42,362 --> 00:18:44,196
That's why you're here,
isn't it?

338
00:18:44,233 --> 00:18:47,571
To hang a few more Cardassian
neck bones from your belt?

339
00:18:47,675 --> 00:18:49,042
Admit it, Kira.

340
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:52,850
You won't be satisfied
until every one of us is dead.

341
00:18:52,887 --> 00:18:53,912
Oh, I don't have time...

342
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:05,377
Don't you ever touch me again.

343
00:19:05,417 --> 00:19:07,786
I guess...

344
00:19:07,823 --> 00:19:09,691
I hit a nerve.

345
00:19:09,727 --> 00:19:10,717
No.

346
00:19:10,764 --> 00:19:13,703
This is hitting a nerve.

347
00:19:14,773 --> 00:19:17,575
Stop pushing me
or I'll make you realize

348
00:19:17,613 --> 00:19:21,885
just how many nerves you have
in that miserable body.

349
00:19:29,976 --> 00:19:32,470
When this is all over...

350
00:19:32,515 --> 00:19:35,044
and the Dominion is defeated...

351
00:19:35,088 --> 00:19:37,788
You won't have any trouble
finding me.

352
00:19:45,614 --> 00:19:47,881
Oh, you'll have to do
something about him

353
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,416
long before that, Commander.

354
00:19:51,461 --> 00:19:53,329
Thanks for all your help.

355
00:19:53,365 --> 00:19:56,270
Oh, you seemed to have things
well under control.

356
00:19:56,305 --> 00:19:57,672
Did I?

357
00:19:57,742 --> 00:20:00,476
Despite his statement
to the contrary

358
00:20:00,515 --> 00:20:04,890
Rusot will not wait until the
end of the war to make his move.

359
00:20:04,927 --> 00:20:07,559
I suggest you don't wait either.

360
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:09,900
Kill him...

361
00:20:09,939 --> 00:20:12,571
before he kills you.

362
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:28,978
Challenge Gowron
in the middle of a war?

363
00:20:29,017 --> 00:20:30,350
It's treasonous.

364
00:20:30,387 --> 00:20:32,858
Gowron is leading us all
to ruin.

365
00:20:32,894 --> 00:20:34,454
It is your duty
to challenge him

366
00:20:34,497 --> 00:20:36,468
to protect the Empire.

367
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:38,028
You would have me

368
00:20:38,073 --> 00:20:40,567
protect the Empire
by breaking my oath...

369
00:20:40,611 --> 00:20:42,980
by spilling the blood
of a Klingon brother

370
00:20:43,018 --> 00:20:44,921
while an enemy
stands at our door?

371
00:20:44,956 --> 00:20:46,687
Where is the honor in that?

372
00:20:46,727 --> 00:20:49,997
He is sacrificing our troops
for his own petty reasons.

373
00:20:50,035 --> 00:20:51,129
Where is the honor in that?

374
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:53,972
The troops are his to command.

375
00:20:54,011 --> 00:20:56,312
It is not our place

376
00:20:56,349 --> 00:20:59,288
to question him unless
he is acting with cowardice

377
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,124
and there is no proof of that.

378
00:21:01,161 --> 00:21:02,494
You are not listening.

379
00:21:02,531 --> 00:21:04,434
I have heard every word
that you have said.

380
00:21:04,469 --> 00:21:06,770
You want me
to become Chancellor.

381
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,037
Me.

382
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,047
Tell me, Worf.

383
00:21:11,085 --> 00:21:13,147
How do you think the members
of the High Council will react

384
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,591
when they're asked to follow

385
00:21:14,627 --> 00:21:16,461
a common man
from the Ketha lowlands?

386
00:21:16,498 --> 00:21:19,630
A man without a drop
of noble blood in his veins?

387
00:21:21,242 --> 00:21:24,340
Kahless himself
was not highborn.

388
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:26,821
Kahless was divine.

389
00:21:26,923 --> 00:21:29,760
Your name is revered
throughout the Empire.

390
00:21:29,796 --> 00:21:32,029
If you seize the leadership

391
00:21:32,068 --> 00:21:33,594
every warrior
from here to Kronos

392
00:21:33,639 --> 00:21:36,612
would swear an oath to you,
and with that kind of support

393
00:21:36,646 --> 00:21:38,947
the High Council
will have no choice

394
00:21:38,985 --> 00:21:41,081
but to accept you as Chancellor.

395
00:21:41,124 --> 00:21:43,995
You begin to sound
like a Romulan.

396
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:49,169
You know I am right.

397
00:21:52,317 --> 00:21:56,623
I am a loyal soldier
of the Empire.

398
00:21:56,661 --> 00:22:00,626
I would rather die
than dishonor my uniform.

399
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,435
By raising a hand
to my Chancellor

400
00:22:02,475 --> 00:22:04,537
in a time of war, I would bring

401
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:07,144
shame to everything
that I've fought to protect

402
00:22:07,186 --> 00:22:08,587
everything that I believe in.

403
00:22:08,622 --> 00:22:09,852
General.

404
00:22:09,959 --> 00:22:12,055
My decision is made!

405
00:22:14,036 --> 00:22:17,340
We will not speak of this again.

406
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:36,884
You're staring again.

407
00:22:36,926 --> 00:22:39,124
Sorry.

408
00:22:39,165 --> 00:22:42,628
I'm... I'm just
worried about you.

409
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,075
Well, don't.

410
00:22:45,112 --> 00:22:48,644
It may be a long time before
the symptoms manifest themselves

411
00:22:48,687 --> 00:22:51,592
and, by then, I'm sure Dr.
Bashir will have found the cure.

412
00:22:53,767 --> 00:22:55,236
Right.

413
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,605
Uh, could you take the helm?

414
00:22:57,642 --> 00:22:59,738
I'm going to get a <i>raktajino.</i>

415
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:12,434
What's wrong?

416
00:23:12,478 --> 00:23:15,076
One of our listening posts
picked up a message.

417
00:23:15,117 --> 00:23:19,423
The Dominion has succeeded
in locating Damar's family.

418
00:23:19,462 --> 00:23:20,624
They're dead.

419
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:25,337
They weren't a part
of this rebellion.

420
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:28,673
The Dominion knew that.
The Founder knew that.

421
00:23:28,716 --> 00:23:32,054
Weyoun knew that.

422
00:23:32,091 --> 00:23:34,825
To kill her and my son...

423
00:23:34,865 --> 00:23:39,809
the casual brutality of it...

424
00:23:39,844 --> 00:23:41,541
the waste of life.

425
00:23:41,581 --> 00:23:43,346
What kind of state

426
00:23:43,385 --> 00:23:46,689
tolerates the murder
of innocent women and children?

427
00:23:46,727 --> 00:23:49,529
What kind of people
give those orders?

428
00:23:49,567 --> 00:23:53,030
Yeah, Damar, what kind of people
give those orders?

429
00:24:11,586 --> 00:24:14,080
Oh, that was stupid.

430
00:24:14,126 --> 00:24:15,720
Not at all.

431
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,993
Damar has a certain...

432
00:24:18,035 --> 00:24:20,370
romanticism about the past.

433
00:24:20,408 --> 00:24:22,743
He could use
a dose of cold water.

434
00:24:22,846 --> 00:24:24,840
Well, I could've picked
a better time.

435
00:24:24,885 --> 00:24:27,254
If he's the man
to lead a new Cardassia

436
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:30,696
if he's the man
we all hope him to be

437
00:24:30,732 --> 00:24:32,532
then the pain of this news

438
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:36,136
made him more receptive
to what you said, not less.

439
00:24:39,386 --> 00:24:41,357
We're approaching
the rendezvous point.

440
00:24:48,441 --> 00:24:49,774
The shuttle is here.

441
00:24:49,811 --> 00:24:53,753
Right on time,
just as I promised.

442
00:24:53,787 --> 00:24:55,256
Damar to Shuttle.

443
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:56,919
Lower your shields
and we'll beam aboard.

444
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:58,295
Acknowledged.

445
00:25:00,737 --> 00:25:01,899
Let's go.

446
00:25:18,213 --> 00:25:21,084
...and, in truth,
I understand his position.

447
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,646
It is the duty of every soldier

448
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,718
to support their leaders
in time of war.

449
00:25:24,762 --> 00:25:27,735
Asking Martok
to stand against Gowron

450
00:25:27,769 --> 00:25:29,398
was a foolish error.

451
00:25:29,439 --> 00:25:31,467
So what are you going to do?

452
00:25:31,511 --> 00:25:35,886
Try to convince Gowron to
discontinue these attacks.

453
00:25:39,731 --> 00:25:41,223
You have said very little.

454
00:25:41,268 --> 00:25:43,296
Look...

455
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,869
I'm just not sure that I
should be giving you advice

456
00:25:45,945 --> 00:25:47,539
on what to do in this situation.

457
00:25:47,583 --> 00:25:49,280
It's a Klingon matter.

458
00:25:50,791 --> 00:25:52,989
You are still a member
of the House of Martok.

459
00:25:55,101 --> 00:25:56,901
This is the first
that I've heard of it.

460
00:25:56,939 --> 00:25:59,912
The General and I
talked about it weeks ago.

461
00:25:59,979 --> 00:26:01,973
He likes you

462
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:03,955
and he considers you
an honorable woman...

463
00:26:03,989 --> 00:26:06,358
a worthy successor to Jadzia.

464
00:26:07,932 --> 00:26:09,629
And so do I.

465
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:11,799
That's very sweet of him.

466
00:26:11,842 --> 00:26:13,311
Sweet?

467
00:26:13,345 --> 00:26:15,714
Not a very Klingon word, is it?

468
00:26:16,786 --> 00:26:17,776
No.

469
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:21,857
It's very... honorable.

470
00:26:21,899 --> 00:26:23,630
Better.

471
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:26,004
Albeit, a little obvious.

472
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:28,741
Now...

473
00:26:28,781 --> 00:26:30,080
tell me what you think.

474
00:26:32,323 --> 00:26:35,160
Okay, but I'm not sure
you're going to like it.

475
00:26:35,197 --> 00:26:36,723
Tell me.

476
00:26:36,767 --> 00:26:39,102
I think that the situation
with Gowron

477
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,168
is a symptom
of a bigger problem.

478
00:26:41,212 --> 00:26:43,206
The Klingon Empire is dying

479
00:26:43,249 --> 00:26:45,550
and I think it deserves to die.

480
00:26:47,192 --> 00:26:48,559
You were right.

481
00:26:48,596 --> 00:26:50,464
I do not like it.

482
00:26:50,501 --> 00:26:51,526
Don't get me wrong.

483
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:53,972
I'm very touched
that you still consider me

484
00:26:54,043 --> 00:26:55,911
to be a member
of the House of Martok

485
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,678
but... I tend to look
at the Empire

486
00:26:57,718 --> 00:27:00,623
with a little more skepticism
than Curzon or Jadzia did.

487
00:27:00,658 --> 00:27:05,067
I see a society that is
in deep denial about itself.

488
00:27:05,102 --> 00:27:07,300
We're talking
about a warrior culture

489
00:27:07,341 --> 00:27:09,471
that prides itself
on maintaining

490
00:27:09,512 --> 00:27:12,417
centuries-old traditions
of honor and integrity

491
00:27:12,453 --> 00:27:14,549
but, in reality, it's willing

492
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,687
to accept corruption
at the highest levels.

493
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:18,256
You are overstating your case.

494
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,271
Am I?

495
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,834
Who was the last leader of the
High Council that you respected?

496
00:27:23,847 --> 00:27:25,784
Has there even been one?

497
00:27:25,818 --> 00:27:27,846
And how many times
have you had to cover up

498
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,154
the crimes of Klingon leaders

499
00:27:29,193 --> 00:27:31,664
because you were told that it
was for the good of the Empire?

500
00:27:31,699 --> 00:27:36,335
I... I know this sounds harsh,
but the truth is

501
00:27:36,377 --> 00:27:38,108
you have been willing
to accept a government

502
00:27:38,148 --> 00:27:39,173
that you know is corrupt.

503
00:27:39,217 --> 00:27:41,815
Gowron is just
the latest example.

504
00:27:41,856 --> 00:27:45,855
Worf, you are the most honorable
and decent man

505
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,734
that I have ever met

506
00:27:47,771 --> 00:27:50,300
and if you are willing
to tolerate men like Gowron

507
00:27:50,343 --> 00:27:53,077
then what hope is there
for the Empire?

508
00:28:24,124 --> 00:28:25,057
We have a prisoner

509
00:28:25,127 --> 00:28:27,030
for the Vorta
who commands this ship.

510
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:34,178
Everything seems to be in order

511
00:28:34,216 --> 00:28:35,947
but you'll have
to leave your weapons here.

512
00:28:35,986 --> 00:28:37,387
Why?

513
00:28:37,423 --> 00:28:39,052
New orders
from Dominion Headquarters...

514
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:41,360
no armed Cardassians allowed
aboard Jem'Hadar vessels.

515
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,305
It sounds like they don't
trust us anymore.

516
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,900
So it would seem.

517
00:28:45,944 --> 00:28:47,915
I'm sorry, but those
are the orders.

518
00:28:47,949 --> 00:28:49,350
Well, it's not your fault.

519
00:28:49,385 --> 00:28:50,649
Do as he says.

520
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:53,526
The three of us should be able
to handle one Bajoran woman.

521
00:28:53,562 --> 00:28:54,929
Take them to the Bridge.

522
00:29:03,318 --> 00:29:04,810
Good luck...

523
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,294
Legate Damar.

524
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,801
We'll run the first test firing
in two hours, 14 minutes.

525
00:29:40,902 --> 00:29:42,896
Agreed.

526
00:29:42,941 --> 00:29:45,412
Coordinate it
with Central Operations.

527
00:29:45,446 --> 00:29:46,471
What's this?

528
00:29:46,516 --> 00:29:47,484
We have a prisoner.

529
00:29:47,518 --> 00:29:48,782
I can see that.

530
00:29:48,821 --> 00:29:49,983
Why are you bringing her to me?

531
00:29:50,024 --> 00:29:51,118
This is Commander Rota

532
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,997
the Deputy Intelligence Officer
for this entire sector.

533
00:29:54,033 --> 00:29:55,833
I would think
that you'd be interested

534
00:29:55,938 --> 00:29:57,430
in interrogating her.

535
00:29:57,475 --> 00:29:59,810
I wasn't informed of this.

536
00:29:59,847 --> 00:30:01,111
Perhaps you haven't
received the report yet.

537
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,175
It's not surprising.

538
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,988
We only took the Commander
prisoner yesterday.

539
00:30:05,027 --> 00:30:06,553
We were under
a communications blackout...

540
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:07,565
Let me see your orders.

541
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:09,091
Of course.

542
00:30:10,439 --> 00:30:11,498
Founder.

543
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:13,343
You honor us with your presence.

544
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,681
I... had no idea
you were in this sector.

545
00:30:15,718 --> 00:30:18,748
My movements are
none of your concern.

546
00:30:18,793 --> 00:30:19,887
No.

547
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:27,741
Have you begun the interrogation
of this prisoner?

548
00:30:27,781 --> 00:30:29,341
Not yet.

549
00:30:29,385 --> 00:30:30,513
Good.

550
00:30:30,554 --> 00:30:32,855
I will conduct
the questioning myself.

551
00:30:32,893 --> 00:30:34,362
As you wish.

552
00:30:34,397 --> 00:30:37,929
Ah... I see
the upgraded plasma rifles

553
00:30:37,973 --> 00:30:39,442
have been distributed.

554
00:30:39,476 --> 00:30:42,381
May I inspect it?

555
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,116
Aha.

556
00:30:46,158 --> 00:30:48,391
An excellent weapon.

557
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,956
What do you think?

558
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:01,154
Secure those hatches.

559
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,838
It wasn't necessary
to kill them all.

560
00:31:09,882 --> 00:31:12,217
We can't afford to be
burdened by prisoners.

561
00:31:12,254 --> 00:31:13,746
We'll argue about this later.

562
00:31:13,792 --> 00:31:17,426
Prepare to flood all decks below
the Bridge with neurazine gas.

563
00:31:17,467 --> 00:31:18,959
Bring the warp drive on line.

564
00:31:19,037 --> 00:31:21,065
Lay in a course
for the Federation.

565
00:31:21,109 --> 00:31:21,974
Commander.

566
00:31:22,078 --> 00:31:22,977
They haven't

567
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:24,985
finished installing
the Breen weapon.

568
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:27,454
We can't leave.

569
00:31:36,112 --> 00:31:38,641
How long before they finish
installing the weapon?

570
00:31:38,684 --> 00:31:39,743
We can't wait!

571
00:31:39,787 --> 00:31:41,450
I'm not leaving
without that weapon.

572
00:31:41,491 --> 00:31:42,653
There are three...

573
00:31:42,694 --> 00:31:45,029
no, four Breen working
in the engine room.

574
00:31:45,066 --> 00:31:48,233
Judging from the diagnostics,
I'd say it'll take them

575
00:31:48,274 --> 00:31:50,940
30 to 45 minutes
to complete their work.

576
00:31:50,981 --> 00:31:52,416
We don't have that much time.

577
00:31:52,451 --> 00:31:53,476
Yes, we do.

578
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,616
No one even knows
we're on the Bridge.

579
00:31:55,658 --> 00:31:57,389
All we have to do is sit tight

580
00:31:57,429 --> 00:31:59,900
give the standard replies
to any inquiries

581
00:31:59,935 --> 00:32:01,929
and wait for the Breen to do
their work.

582
00:32:01,973 --> 00:32:03,272
Damar, this is insane.

583
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:05,007
She'll get us all killed.

584
00:32:05,114 --> 00:32:06,242
There's an incoming message.

585
00:32:09,224 --> 00:32:11,593
They want to speak to the Vorta.

586
00:32:17,578 --> 00:32:19,446
Disable the visual feed.

587
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:20,643
What was her name?

588
00:32:21,654 --> 00:32:23,021
Come on!

589
00:32:23,057 --> 00:32:24,390
I'm looking.

590
00:32:26,265 --> 00:32:28,668
Ah. Her name was Luaran.

591
00:32:28,704 --> 00:32:31,073
This is Luaran.

592
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:34,482
No, I can't see you either.

593
00:32:34,517 --> 00:32:37,490
We're experiencing trouble
with our com system.

594
00:32:37,525 --> 00:32:40,225
What do you want?

595
00:32:40,266 --> 00:32:41,325
Just a moment.

596
00:32:42,136 --> 00:32:43,332
They want

597
00:32:43,373 --> 00:32:45,241
the status report
on our navigational array.

598
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:46,211
I've got it.

599
00:32:48,485 --> 00:32:51,014
That data is coming to you.

600
00:32:51,058 --> 00:32:52,926
Excellent.

601
00:32:52,962 --> 00:32:54,990
We'll be repairing
our com system

602
00:32:55,034 --> 00:32:56,799
for at least the next hour.

603
00:32:56,838 --> 00:32:59,071
I'll contact you
when we're finished.

604
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,602
Luaran out.

605
00:33:00,647 --> 00:33:01,980
What if they didn't believe you?

606
00:33:03,587 --> 00:33:04,783
Then we're dead.

607
00:33:27,177 --> 00:33:29,444
- Hey.
- Hey.

608
00:33:29,483 --> 00:33:32,753
Keiko whipped you
up some crab rolls.

609
00:33:32,791 --> 00:33:34,955
She... well, we thought
you might be hungry.

610
00:33:34,996 --> 00:33:36,329
Thanks...

611
00:33:36,366 --> 00:33:37,528
uh, to both of you.

612
00:33:39,273 --> 00:33:41,403
Uh, about the other day...

613
00:33:41,445 --> 00:33:42,675
Oh, forget it.

614
00:33:44,318 --> 00:33:45,719
How's the work going?

615
00:33:45,755 --> 00:33:48,694
I'm still firmly entrenched
in square one.

616
00:33:51,702 --> 00:33:53,331
You mind
if I ask you a question?

617
00:33:53,374 --> 00:33:54,468
About 31?

618
00:33:55,913 --> 00:33:57,576
Go ahead.

619
00:33:57,617 --> 00:33:59,348
Well, if you were
to find the cure

620
00:33:59,388 --> 00:34:01,416
and they got to know about it...

621
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,827
what do you think they'd do?

622
00:34:02,863 --> 00:34:06,360
Well, I imagine they'd be, uh...
very concerned.

623
00:34:06,405 --> 00:34:08,308
The very existence of a cure

624
00:34:08,343 --> 00:34:10,405
would jeopardize their plan
to eradicate the Founders.

625
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:12,681
Wouldn't surprise me
if Sloan or another operative

626
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,284
turned up here on the station
to destroy my work.

627
00:34:15,326 --> 00:34:16,989
What are you getting at?

628
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:20,937
I think you should send
a message to Starfleet Medical

629
00:34:20,973 --> 00:34:22,841
saying that you have found
the cure.

630
00:34:24,148 --> 00:34:26,619
You're trying to lure someone
from Section 31?

631
00:34:26,653 --> 00:34:28,954
Yeah. That's right.

632
00:34:28,993 --> 00:34:30,827
What happens when this operative
gets here?

633
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,433
We capture him.

634
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:35,167
Then we figure out a way

635
00:34:35,207 --> 00:34:36,437
to get some information
out of him.

636
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,209
He may not know anything
about the disease.

637
00:34:40,252 --> 00:34:41,242
Maybe not...

638
00:34:41,355 --> 00:34:43,485
but I bet he knows who does.

639
00:34:43,527 --> 00:34:45,053
What do you think?

640
00:34:45,097 --> 00:34:47,591
I think it's a plan...

641
00:34:47,637 --> 00:34:49,835
a very good plan.

642
00:34:49,876 --> 00:34:52,279
When did you get so devious?

643
00:34:52,348 --> 00:34:54,182
I've been hanging around you
too long.

644
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,282
Let's just hope this works

645
00:34:56,358 --> 00:34:57,691
and we cure Odo.

646
00:34:57,728 --> 00:35:00,029
That's all I care about.

647
00:35:00,067 --> 00:35:01,935
Me, too, Miles.

648
00:35:03,342 --> 00:35:04,811
Our next target...

649
00:35:06,182 --> 00:35:08,244
Sarpedion V.

650
00:35:08,354 --> 00:35:12,797
Sarpedion is the headquarters
of the entire 12th Order.

651
00:35:12,831 --> 00:35:16,967
Yes. You'll take 15 Vor'cha-
class battle cruisers in first

652
00:35:17,008 --> 00:35:18,705
to soften their defenses.

653
00:35:18,745 --> 00:35:19,907
Then, General Chu'vok, you'll...

654
00:35:19,948 --> 00:35:21,212
Chancellor!

655
00:35:22,387 --> 00:35:24,084
That world is one of the most

656
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:27,657
heavily fortified positions
in the entire Cardassian Empire.

657
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:32,440
15 battle cruisers will barely
scratch their defenses.

658
00:35:33,947 --> 00:35:37,183
If you lack the courage
to fight an uphill battle

659
00:35:37,222 --> 00:35:41,494
then perhaps you should
retire to your bed.

660
00:35:47,648 --> 00:35:50,348
I will fight any battle...

661
00:35:50,454 --> 00:35:51,980
anywhere.

662
00:35:59,642 --> 00:36:01,977
For the Empire.

663
00:36:02,015 --> 00:36:04,817
Spoken like a true warrior.

664
00:36:08,965 --> 00:36:11,459
After Martok has softened
their defenses...

665
00:36:11,505 --> 00:36:12,495
No.

666
00:36:14,211 --> 00:36:16,148
We cannot attack Sarpedion.

667
00:36:17,352 --> 00:36:20,291
I decide what can...

668
00:36:20,325 --> 00:36:23,993
and cannot be done.

669
00:36:24,034 --> 00:36:27,976
You rule without wisdom
and without honor.

670
00:36:28,011 --> 00:36:29,708
The warriors
that are gathered here

671
00:36:29,748 --> 00:36:32,380
would not say this to you,
but I will.

672
00:36:32,455 --> 00:36:35,394
You are squandering our ships
and our lives

673
00:36:35,428 --> 00:36:37,399
on a petty act of vengeance!

674
00:36:37,433 --> 00:36:40,096
I should've known better
than to trust you again.

675
00:36:40,229 --> 00:36:42,063
If you were a true Klingon

676
00:36:42,101 --> 00:36:44,470
I would kill you
where you stand!

677
00:36:44,506 --> 00:36:47,000
Fortunately for you

678
00:36:47,046 --> 00:36:53,585
that... child's uniform shields
you from your rightful fate.

679
00:36:59,074 --> 00:37:01,102
What I say now

680
00:37:01,146 --> 00:37:03,640
I say as a member
of the House of Martok

681
00:37:03,686 --> 00:37:05,680
not a Starfleet officer.

682
00:37:09,499 --> 00:37:11,025
You have dishonored yourself

683
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:13,907
and the Empire,
and you are not worthy

684
00:37:13,943 --> 00:37:15,708
to lead the Council.

685
00:37:15,748 --> 00:37:18,346
There can be only one answer
to that.

686
00:37:27,576 --> 00:37:29,102
Worf...

687
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:31,310
this is madness.

688
00:38:29,691 --> 00:38:33,895
You will not have this... day.

689
00:38:57,625 --> 00:39:00,223
Hail Worf!

690
00:39:00,265 --> 00:39:02,566
Leader of the Empire.

691
00:39:02,604 --> 00:39:03,572
Worf!

692
00:39:03,606 --> 00:39:06,340
Worf! Worf! Worf!

693
00:39:06,379 --> 00:39:08,110
Worf! Worf!

694
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,118
Wait.

695
00:39:09,152 --> 00:39:10,120
Worf!

696
00:39:10,155 --> 00:39:11,283
Hear me. Hear me!

697
00:39:11,324 --> 00:39:12,793
Worf...!

698
00:39:12,828 --> 00:39:15,357
What I have done...

699
00:39:15,401 --> 00:39:17,463
was for the Empire.

700
00:39:17,506 --> 00:39:20,707
A new day must dawn
for our people.

701
00:39:20,747 --> 00:39:24,188
I am not the man
to usher in that day

702
00:39:24,222 --> 00:39:28,528
but there is a man here who can.

703
00:39:29,535 --> 00:39:30,503
Worf...

704
00:39:30,537 --> 00:39:32,974
I do not seek the leadership.

705
00:39:33,044 --> 00:39:37,818
Kahless said, "Great
men do not seek power.

706
00:39:39,593 --> 00:39:42,191
They have power
thrust upon them."

707
00:39:47,445 --> 00:39:49,507
Hail Martok!

708
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:52,682
Leader of the Empire.

709
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:55,891
Leader of destiny.

710
00:40:10,833 --> 00:40:12,166
How much longer?

711
00:40:12,203 --> 00:40:13,365
I'm not certain.

712
00:40:13,407 --> 00:40:14,808
It appears
they're having problems

713
00:40:14,843 --> 00:40:16,278
connecting the secondary relays.

714
00:40:19,488 --> 00:40:20,684
Odo, are you all right?

715
00:40:20,724 --> 00:40:22,661
Yes.

716
00:40:22,696 --> 00:40:25,133
Don't worry. I'm...

717
00:40:32,886 --> 00:40:35,255
I'm... I'm sorry.

718
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:38,559
There's nothing
to be sorry about.

719
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:42,236
Just... stay with me, Odo.

720
00:40:42,275 --> 00:40:43,869
Stay with me.

721
00:40:43,913 --> 00:40:45,542
We're going to get out of here.

722
00:40:45,584 --> 00:40:48,021
All right? Just hang on
a little while longer.

723
00:40:48,056 --> 00:40:49,252
It's over.

724
00:40:49,292 --> 00:40:50,989
Shut up, Rusot.

725
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,659
The shape-shifter is useless.

726
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:53,829
The whole plan is coming apart.

727
00:40:53,871 --> 00:40:55,033
We have to get out of here now.

728
00:40:55,073 --> 00:40:56,269
Go back to your post.

729
00:40:56,309 --> 00:40:58,074
No. No more.

730
00:40:58,114 --> 00:40:59,173
We're leaving now.

731
00:40:59,283 --> 00:41:01,413
That would be unwise.

732
00:41:04,262 --> 00:41:06,324
You're still a Cardassian,
Garak.

733
00:41:06,367 --> 00:41:08,030
You're not going to kill
one of your own people

734
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,038
for a Bajoran woman.

735
00:41:09,073 --> 00:41:11,374
How little you understand me.

736
00:41:11,412 --> 00:41:14,146
Put your weapons down,
both of you!

737
00:41:14,186 --> 00:41:15,553
You want her dead, too, Damar.

738
00:41:15,589 --> 00:41:16,853
I know you do.

739
00:41:16,892 --> 00:41:19,056
But you're the leader
of the rebellion

740
00:41:19,097 --> 00:41:21,661
and don't want to kill someone
wearing a Starfleet uniform.

741
00:41:21,704 --> 00:41:23,333
Let me do it for you.

742
00:41:24,878 --> 00:41:27,407
They've finished installing
the dampening weapon.

743
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:29,615
Then let's all get
the hell out of here.

744
00:41:29,656 --> 00:41:30,624
Not you.

745
00:41:30,658 --> 00:41:32,959
I'm still here, Rusot.

746
00:41:32,997 --> 00:41:34,364
Damar, shoot him.

747
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,168
We can kill them both and keep
the Breen weapon for ourselves.

748
00:41:37,207 --> 00:41:38,699
I believe in you, Damar.

749
00:41:38,744 --> 00:41:40,441
I know you're the right man

750
00:41:40,482 --> 00:41:43,114
to restore the Empire
we so loyally served

751
00:41:43,155 --> 00:41:45,422
the Empire we loved.

752
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:48,799
Together, we can lead our people
to greatness again.

753
00:41:48,835 --> 00:41:51,467
Just aim and fire.

754
00:42:07,446 --> 00:42:09,177
He was my friend...

755
00:42:11,423 --> 00:42:13,052
but his Cardassia is dead

756
00:42:13,093 --> 00:42:15,223
and it won't be coming back.

757
00:42:24,688 --> 00:42:26,682
Flood all compartments
with the gas.

758
00:42:33,108 --> 00:42:34,668
Clear all moorings.

759
00:42:37,251 --> 00:42:40,156
Bow thrusters ahead full.

760
00:42:52,254 --> 00:42:54,384
We've cleared
their defense perimeter.

761
00:43:00,707 --> 00:43:01,835
Take the helm.

762
00:43:21,491 --> 00:43:24,954
You're... probably angry.

763
00:43:24,999 --> 00:43:27,232
Why?

764
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,036
I...

765
00:43:29,076 --> 00:43:31,981
I hid my true condition.

766
00:43:32,016 --> 00:43:36,220
Odo... I've known all along.

767
00:43:37,897 --> 00:43:39,993
But it's not over.

768
00:43:40,035 --> 00:43:42,370
Julian's probably working
on a cure right now.

769
00:43:42,474 --> 00:43:45,880
Shh, shh.
Nerys, Nerys, don't.

770
00:43:45,916 --> 00:43:47,944
Just...

771
00:43:47,987 --> 00:43:50,458
stay here... with me.
