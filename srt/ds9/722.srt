1
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,264
KIRA:
There, right there.

2
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:15,808
The explosion began

3
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:17,392
at the intercooler
matrix

4
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,311
and your men were supposed
to plant the bomb

5
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:21,939
here at the secondary
plasma relay.

6
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:23,482
What difference
does it make?

7
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:24,525
The ship was destroyed.

8
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:25,818
GARAK:
The intercooler was

9
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:27,945
the obvious choice
for sabotage.

10
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,822
Their security checks
could have found the bomb

11
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:31,866
and disarmed it before
the ship left orbit.

12
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:33,325
But they<i> didn't</i> find it.

13
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:34,994
That isn't
the point.

14
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:36,370
Your men ignored
their instructions

15
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,663
and their training.

16
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:40,123
Let us not lose
sight of the fact

17
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,250
that the mission
was a success.

18
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,669
It was a success

19
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:45,337
because the
Jem'Hadar security

20
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:46,505
slipped up
and we got lucky.

21
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:48,131
Don't use
those men again

22
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,217
for anything other than
routine reconnaissance.

23
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:52,135
They're five
of my best men.

24
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,179
Bronok is one
of the most experienced...

25
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,891
You've been told
before-- no names.

26
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:59,727
Each cell has
to be insulated

27
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:01,186
from the cell above
and the cell below.

28
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,188
If I know the
names of your men

29
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,231
and I am captured...

30
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,608
Yes, I've heard
the lecture.

31
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,944
Well, then you shouldn't
have to be reminded.

32
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:12,573
It's been a long day.

33
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,491
Why don't
we take a break?

34
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,871
Good idea.

35
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:21,040
The air in here
is getting stale.

36
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,167
(<i> Garak chuckles</i> )

37
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:27,046
You going to do
something about him?

38
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:28,630
I am.

39
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,632
I'm giving him my support.

40
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,886
All right.

41
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:38,181
This does not bode well.

42
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:41,351
Odo.

43
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,398
The raid on the Tevak
shipyard was successful.

44
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:49,026
I penetrated
the Operations Center

45
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,527
disabled
the security protocols.

46
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,905
The rest of the team
sabotaged

47
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:55,449
the dilithium
storage bunkers.

48
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:59,327
An hour after we left, the
entire facility was vaporized.

49
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,747
You should get some rest.

50
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,331
That sounds good to me.

51
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,750
Anyone in the
bunk room?

52
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:06,835
No.

53
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,211
Okay, it's
all yours.

54
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,212
Right.

55
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,840
Odo.

56
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,383
Good work.

57
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,095
Thank you.

58
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:30,150
(<i> breathing heavily</i> )

59
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,457
Huh?

60
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,254
It's just like you

61
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:54,341
to come sneaking in here
without warning.

62
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:57,886
My approach may have been quiet,
but I assure you

63
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,472
I had no intention
of sneaking up on you.

64
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:02,181
My apologies.

65
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,520
If... I may ask...

66
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,064
Why...

67
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:13,068
have I deteriorated
so rapidly?

68
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:16,195
(<i> groans</i> )

69
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:19,324
I've been assuming
dozens of different forms

70
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:22,201
over the... past few weeks.

71
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,623
Changing shape seems to...

72
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:30,251
accelerate the progress
of the disease.

73
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,046
Perhaps you should stop.

74
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:34,506
And do what?

75
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:37,968
Lie here waiting to die?

76
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,011
I came to work.

77
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:40,762
Work is what I'm going to do.

78
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:44,725
I take it Commander Kira is
unaware of your true condition.

79
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,226
That's right.

80
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,313
And I prefer
that it stays that way.

81
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,899
I won't breathe a word.

82
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,901
See that you don't.

83
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:57,612
She has enough
on her mind without...

84
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,698
worrying about me.

85
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:02,034
And I...

86
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:07,330
don't want... her...

87
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,749
Pity?

88
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:12,211
(<i> sighs</i> )

89
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:14,880
Is there a reason
you came in here?

90
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,758
We have need of a contact
on Kelvas V.

91
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:20,010
I remember your telling
me that you knew...

92
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,721
I may have a few names for you.

93
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,265
I have to give it some thought.

94
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,308
(<i> breathes heavily</i> )

95
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,194
Odo, I hope you know
how much I...

96
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:40,447
If I don't want pity
from the woman I love

97
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,117
why would I want it from you?

98
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:51,708
(<i> sighs</i> )

99
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:03,840
Morning.

100
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,966
Oh. What time is it?

101
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,552
0630.

102
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,470
Another all-nighter.

103
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,847
That's four in a row.

104
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,515
You can't keep this up.

105
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,601
I'm beginning
to agree with you.

106
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:18,230
And, to add insult to injury,
I'm not getting anywhere.

107
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,942
My DNA integration theory's
a blind alley.

108
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,443
So where does that leave you?

109
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,404
Back on square one.

110
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:27,239
Whoever engineered
this shape-shifter virus

111
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:29,699
certainly did a good job
of covering their tracks.

112
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,869
Julian, it's time to face facts.

113
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,079
You're not going
to pull a rabbit

114
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,747
out of your medkit.

115
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:38,458
Now, even the Founders
themselves couldn't find a cure

116
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,709
and they had all the resources

117
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,211
of the Dominion
at their command.

118
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,004
Now, I know you don't
want to hear this...

119
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:46,425
but the only way
we're going to find a cure

120
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:49,219
is to track down whoever created
this thing in the first place.

121
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,012
Miles...

122
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,391
We have got to find a way
to get inside Section 31.

123
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:55,809
We've tried that.

124
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,685
We've tried and we've tried

125
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:00,021
and all we managed to do
was waste two weeks

126
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,564
chasing phantoms
from here to Vulcan.

127
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,690
You want to face facts?

128
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,025
Face this fact:

129
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,278
Section 31 have managed
to stay in hiding

130
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:08,363
for over<i> 300</i> years.

131
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,907
They're not going to come
scurrying into the light

132
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,909
just because Miles O'Brien
and Julian Bashir

133
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,244
are on the case.

134
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:16,537
Which is why I still say

135
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,748
we should take this
to Captain Sisko

136
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,750
and let him contact
Starfleet Intelligence.

137
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,043
Maybe they can...

138
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,962
All that will do
is alert Section 31

139
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,505
to the fact
that we're on to them.

140
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,174
And you know what they'll do?

141
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,467
They'll go deeper into hiding--

142
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:29,968
probably send
someone here

143
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,886
to destroy whatever
headway I've made.

144
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,054
No.

145
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,307
No more cloak and dagger games.

146
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:37,142
Science is the answer here.

147
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,769
Every puzzle has a solution,
every disease a cure.

148
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,022
It's just a matter
of finding it.

149
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,858
Now, if you'll kindly get
the hell out of here

150
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,443
I have work to do.

151
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:58,079
Martok's attack on Avenal VII
was a disgrace.

152
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,707
He had the advantage
of surprise.

153
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,877
The Dominion wasn't expecting us
to take the offensive

154
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,880
so soon after the Breen
entered the war.

155
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,176
Avenal should've been
an easy victory for him

156
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:15,305
but instead, he's handed
us a shameful defeat.

157
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,932
General Martok and I
both advised you

158
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,267
against attacking a world

159
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,561
so deep inside
Dominion territory.

160
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,605
He was outnumbered
six-to-one at Avenal.

161
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,024
Six-to-one.

162
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,485
A good Commander finds ways
to beat the odds

163
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,028
not hide behind them.

164
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:32,030
He didn't hide behind anything.

165
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,158
He fought longer and harder
than I would have in his place.

166
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,994
Have you read Worf's
after-action report?

167
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,079
(<i> tossing padd on desk</i> )

168
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,914
Seven Klingon ships
destroyed.

169
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,957
Five others severely damaged.

170
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,959
General Martok himself
in critical condition

171
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,627
in the<i> Rotarran</i> Sick Bay.

172
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:49,256
He's expected to survive.

173
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:50,965
That's not the point!

174
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,093
This entire operation has been

175
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,678
a waste of resources,
men and equipment.

176
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,055
The blame lies with the man

177
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,432
who ordered the mission
in the first place

178
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:00,600
not the man who tried
to carry it out.

179
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:11,528
That's one of the things
I like about you, Captain...

180
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,324
your loyalty to your friends.

181
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:20,287
This has nothing to do
with loyalty.

182
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,456
Of course not.

183
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,212
In any case,
you needn't worry.

184
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,381
Martok's a popular
General with the troops

185
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,049
and that counts
for something.

186
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,426
I won't relieve
him of command...

187
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,512
yet.

188
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:52,277
As you can see, the Klingon raid
on Avenal was easily broken up.

189
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:55,238
I am less concerned
about this Klingon attack

190
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,865
than I am
the Cardassian rebellion.

191
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:00,619
We cannot fight
the combined forces

192
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:04,164
of the Federation, the Klingons
and the Romulans

193
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,207
and face a full-scale uprising

194
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,459
behind the lines.

195
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,127
I completely agree.

196
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,254
However, the situation
is well in hand.

197
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:14,090
We still have control
over the Cardassian military

198
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,344
while Damar has only a handful
of terrorists at his disposal.

199
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,304
I assure you both

200
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:22,890
that this<i> rebellion</i> 
poses no threat.

201
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,351
(<i> electronically</i>
<i>distorted voice</i> )

202
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:28,229
You are correct,
and you also assured us

203
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,983
that Damar would never turn
against the Dominion.

204
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:34,277
That was...

205
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:37,531
an error, to be sure,
but an understandable one.

206
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,115
No one could have foreseen

207
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,867
that Damar would become
a terrorist.

208
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,285
The concept is

209
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:44,287
antithetical to
the very nature

210
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:45,288
of Cardassians.

211
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,831
They respect authority.

212
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,209
They value the rule of law
and the security of order

213
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,878
which is exactly
what the Dominion offers them.

214
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,087
(<i> distorted voice</i> )

215
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,381
Exactly.

216
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:57,425
If our cloning facilities
were operational

217
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,220
I would eliminate
this Weyoun immediately.

218
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,096
Damar must pay

219
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:05,141
the price for his treason.

220
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:08,853
Redouble your efforts
to find his wife and children

221
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,898
and I want you to begin
interrogating Cardassian

222
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,901
teachers, scientists,
local officials.

223
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:18,863
The population must understand,
in no uncertain terms

224
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,991
that dissent
will not be tolerated.

225
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,660
Then I want you to begin

226
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,038
putting Cardassian civilians
in and around

227
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:30,250
the Dominion
military installations.

228
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,421
If Damar destroys another
shipyard, he will have to kill

229
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,924
a great many
of his own countrymen as well.

230
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,719
This will help turn the people
against him.

231
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:43,513
An excellent plan.

232
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:46,683
Your opinion was not solicited.

233
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,938
Thot Pran,
the sooner we can regain

234
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,190
the offensive on the front
lines, the better.

235
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,444
The installation of the Breen
weapons on the Dominion ships

236
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:59,987
must be accelerated.

237
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:04,075
Please issue the appropriate
orders to your engineers.

238
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,953
(<i> distorted voice</i> )

239
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,541
(<i> sighs</i> )

240
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,461
How long before
our cloning facilities

241
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,212
are operational again?

242
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:20,925
Not for several days,
perhaps even weeks.

243
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,969
Ah.

244
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,096
Well, keep me informed.

245
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:35,106
GARAK:
And according to our new
contact on Kelvas V

246
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,399
the Breen will
begin to install

247
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,067
their energy-dampening
weapons

248
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,945
aboard Jem'Hadar
fighters within a week.

249
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,530
Has the Federation
made any progress

250
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,990
in counteracting
these weapons?

251
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,200
No. They're
still having trouble

252
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,578
understanding
the underlying technology.

253
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,622
Well, why aren't
the Klingon ships

254
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:52,457
affected by these
Breen weapons?

255
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,167
We don't know
that yet either

256
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,712
but if we could supply
the Federation with one

257
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:58,837
it would give
them a chance

258
00:13:58,837 --> 00:13:59,922
to come up with
a countermeasure.

259
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,299
I had the
same thought.

260
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:03,050
Our priority
should be to
free Cardassia

261
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,844
from the Dominion,
not do Starfleet's dirty work.

262
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:08,264
We're all in this together.

263
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,183
By helping Starfleet,
we're helping ourselves.

264
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,601
KIRA:
There's a Cardassian

265
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,687
repair facility
in the Kelvas system, right?

266
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:14,937
Yes.

267
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,190
I take it you have
something in mind.

268
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,400
It won't be easy, but...

269
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,486
if we can get onto the Bridge...

270
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:26,282
All right, we'll take
a five-man team--

271
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,575
the four of us plus Odo.

272
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,118
Garak, I'm going to need

273
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,120
everything you have
on the Kelvas facility.

274
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:33,873
Is something wrong?

275
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,042
Possibly.

276
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,252
Uh, may I have a few words
with the Commander?

277
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,472
What's on your mind?

278
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,725
It's about taking Odo
on this mission.

279
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:56,521
I'm afraid there's no easy way
of putting it.

280
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:59,482
He's been hiding the true extent
of his illness

281
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,526
from you
for some time now.

282
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:04,404
His condition has
severely deteriorated

283
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,447
and the more
he changes form...

284
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,075
the worse he gets.

285
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,201
I know.

286
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:12,203
You do?

287
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:13,788
I love him, Garak.

288
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,707
You think I really
wouldn't notice?

289
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:17,333
Why the pretense?

290
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,001
Because I also know

291
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,880
that he doesn't want me
to find out about it.

292
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,381
He wants to put
up a brave front

293
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,842
and protect me from
the truth, well, fine.

294
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:28,887
If that's what makes
this easier for him

295
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:30,889
if that gives him
one last shred

296
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:33,057
of dignity to hold onto

297
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:36,310
then I'll go on ignoring
what's happening to him

298
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,604
until the very end.

299
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,024
Anything else?

300
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,943
No.

301
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,945
All right.

302
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,406
We will need
a Cardassian shuttle

303
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:49,990
with the latest
security protocols.

304
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,618
And a schematic of the...

305
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,563
(<i> on com</i> )
Sisko to Worf.

306
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,273
Worf here.

307
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,317
SISKO: I'd like to see you
in my office, Commander.

308
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,486
On my way.

309
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,831
How's Martok?

310
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:40,291
Dr. Bashir says
he will make a full recovery.

311
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:43,210
I'm glad to hear that.

312
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,464
Mr. Worf, we've got

313
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:49,383
a serious problem
on our hands.

314
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,635
Gowron.

315
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,470
He seems
hell-bent

316
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,264
on continuing these offensives
regardless of the cost.

317
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,558
He is a stubborn
and arrogant man.

318
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,561
That may be true,
but I hope he's not a fool.

319
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,856
He's risking
the entire defense posture.

320
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:04,565
Why can't he see that?

321
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:08,486
I suspect the Chancellor cannot
see anything at the moment

322
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:09,445
except for one man.

323
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:10,530
You mean, Martok?

324
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,534
The Chancellor sees him
as a political threat.

325
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,870
These<i> attacks</i>
against the Dominion

326
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,830
are designed
to humiliate the General

327
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,456
in the eyes of the Empire--

328
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,960
to force him to endure
defeat after defeat.

329
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,505
Are you telling me that this
is a political vendetta?

330
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:30,508
It would not be the first time
that a Klingon Chancellor

331
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:33,260
put his own interests
ahead of the greater good.

332
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,936
Something has to be done.

333
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:43,730
Agreed.

334
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:48,275
And I do have a solution,
but it will not be easy.

335
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:51,153
You do whatever it takes,
Mr. Worf.

336
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:54,073
Those Klingon ships out there

337
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,910
are the only thing
between us and the Breen.

338
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,580
Gowron is risking the safety
of the entire Alpha Quadrant

339
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,790
and he has to stop.

340
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,626
Understood.

341
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,468
My men have secured
the shuttle.

342
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,012
They'll meet us
at those coordinates.

343
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,933
Good.

344
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,267
Are you enjoying yourself?

345
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,644
Getting Cardassians
to do your bidding

346
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,354
must give you great pleasure.

347
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,314
I'm a little busy right now,
Rusot.

348
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,442
Why don't you find
someone else to play with?

349
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,318
You may have fooled Damar

350
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:33,362
into believing you're here
to fight the Dominion

351
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,155
but I know
why you're really here.

352
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,490
Oh, this should be good.

353
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,200
You killed hundreds
of Cardassians

354
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,619
during the occupation

355
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,246
and now you're getting
a chance to do it again.

356
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,164
That's why you're here,
isn't it?

357
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:47,460
To hang a few more Cardassian
neck bones from your belt?

358
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,128
Admit it, Kira.

359
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,840
You won't be satisfied
until every one of us is dead.

360
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,008
Oh, I don't have time...

361
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,394
Don't you<i> ever</i> 
touch me again.

362
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,605
I guess...

363
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,523
I hit a nerve.

364
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,691
No.

365
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,152
<i>This</i> is hitting
a nerve.

366
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,570
(<i> groaning</i> )

367
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,448
Stop pushing me or
I'll make you realize

368
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,617
just how many
nerves you have

369
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,702
in that miserable body.

370
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:22,787
(<i> grunts</i> )

371
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,463
When this is all over...

372
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:34,924
and the Dominion is defeated...

373
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:37,593
You won't have any trouble
finding me.

374
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,854
GARAK:
Oh, you'll have to do
something about him

375
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:51,357
long before that, Commander.

376
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,192
Thanks for all your help.

377
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,195
Oh, you seemed to have things
well under control.

378
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,571
Did I?

379
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:00,533
Despite his statement
to the contrary

380
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,786
Rusot will not wait
until the end of the war to make

381
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:04,787
his move.

382
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:05,788
I suggest

383
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:07,456
you don't wait either.

384
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,792
Kill him...

385
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:12,503
before he kills you.

386
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:29,103
Challenge Gowron
in the middle of a war?

387
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:30,479
It's treasonous.

388
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,024
Gowron is leading us all
to ruin.

389
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:34,567
It is your duty
to challenge him

390
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,360
to protect the Empire.

391
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,071
You would have me

392
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:40,781
protect the Empire
by breaking my oath...

393
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,992
by spilling the blood
of a Klingon brother

394
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,036
while an enemy
stands at our door?

395
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:46,913
Where is the honor in that?

396
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:50,083
He is sacrificing our troops
for his own petty reasons.

397
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,209
Where is the honor in that?

398
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:54,087
The troops are his to command.

399
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,296
It is not our place

400
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:59,299
to question him unless
he is acting with cowardice

401
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,219
and there is no proof of that.

402
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:02,595
You are not listening.

403
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,430
I have heard every word
that you have said.

404
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,891
You want me
to become Chancellor.

405
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,101
Me.

406
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:09,268
(<i> chuckles</i> )

407
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,229
Tell me, Worf.

408
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:13,189
How do you think the members
of the High Council will react

409
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,857
when they're asked to follow

410
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,442
a common man
from the Ketha lowlands?

411
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:19,528
A man without a drop
of noble blood in his veins?

412
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:24,408
Kahless himself
was not highborn.

413
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,702
Kahless was divine.

414
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:27,870
Your name

415
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,789
is revered
throughout the Empire.

416
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,874
If you seize the leadership

417
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,751
every warrior
from here to Kronos

418
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:36,796
would swear an oath to you,
and with that kind of support

419
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:39,006
the High Council
will have no choice

420
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,050
but to accept you as Chancellor.

421
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:44,053
You begin to sound
like a Romulan.

422
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:49,183
You know I am right.

423
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:52,186
(<i> sighs</i> )

424
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:56,732
I am a loyal soldier
of the Empire.

425
00:21:56,732 --> 00:22:00,778
I would rather die
than dishonor my uniform.

426
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:02,280
By raising a hand
to my Chancellor

427
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,406
in a time of war,
I would bring

428
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:07,118
shame to everything
that I've fought to protect

429
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:08,619
everything that I believe in.

430
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:09,912
General.

431
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:12,081
My decision is made!

432
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,170
We will not speak of this again.

433
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:37,190
You're staring again.

434
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,275
Sorry.

435
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:42,945
I'm... I'm just
worried about you.

436
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:45,281
Well, don't.

437
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:48,993
It may be a long time before
the symptoms manifest themselves

438
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:51,871
and, by then, I'm sure Dr.
Bashir will have found the cure.

439
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,457
Right.

440
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,793
Uh, could you take the helm?

441
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,837
I'm going to get
a<i> raktajino.</i>

442
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,683
What's wrong?

443
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:15,061
One of our listening posts
picked up a message.

444
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:19,606
The Dominion has succeeded
in locating Damar's family.

445
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:20,691
They're dead.

446
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:25,196
They weren't a part
of this rebellion.

447
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:28,866
The Dominion knew that.
The Founder knew that.

448
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:30,534
Weyoun

449
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,203
knew that.

450
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:34,997
To kill her and my son...

451
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:40,002
the casual brutality of it...

452
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:41,545
the waste of life.

453
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,463
What kind of state

454
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:46,967
tolerates the murder
of innocent women and children?

455
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,636
What kind of people
give those orders?

456
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:53,266
Yeah, Damar, what kind of people
give those orders?

457
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:08,072
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

458
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,449
(<i> sighs</i> )

459
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:14,203
Oh, that was stupid.

460
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:15,913
Not at all.

461
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:18,082
Damar has a certain...

462
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:20,376
romanticism about the past.

463
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,836
He could use
a dose of cold water.

464
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:24,922
Well, I could've picked
a better time.

465
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:27,341
If he's the man
to lead a new Cardassia

466
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:28,466
if he's the man

467
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:30,803
we all hope him to be

468
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:32,763
then the pain of this news

469
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:36,225
made him more receptive
to what you said, not less.

470
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:39,312
(<i> console beeping</i> )

471
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:41,272
We're approaching
the rendezvous point.

472
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:49,947
The shuttle is here.

473
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:53,659
Right on time,
just as I promised.

474
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,161
Damar to Shuttle.

475
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:56,870
Lower your shields
and we'll beam aboard.

476
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,205
MALE:
Acknowledged.

477
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,917
Let's go.

478
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,936
...and, in truth,
I understand
his position.

479
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,688
It is the duty
of every soldier

480
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,648
to support their leaders
in time of war.

481
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:27,609
Asking Martok to
stand against Gowron

482
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,487
was a foolish error.

483
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:31,405
So what are you going to do?

484
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:35,533
Try to convince Gowron to
discontinue these attacks.

485
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:41,123
You have said
very little.

486
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:43,042
Look...

487
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:45,752
I'm just not sure that I
should be giving you advice

488
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,087
on what to do in this situation.

489
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,922
It's a Klingon matter.

490
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:52,885
You are still a member
of the House of Martok.

491
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,514
This is the first
that I've heard of it.

492
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:57,639
The General and I

493
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,766
talked about it
weeks ago.

494
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,768
He likes you

495
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,687
and he considers you
an honorable woman--

496
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:06,232
a worthy successor
to Jadzia.

497
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,402
And so do I.

498
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:11,611
That's very sweet of him.

499
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:13,155
Sweet?

500
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:15,573
Not a very Klingon word, is it?

501
00:26:16,534 --> 00:26:17,617
No.

502
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:21,705
It's very... honorable.

503
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,416
Better.

504
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:25,625
Albeit, a little obvious.

505
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:28,546
Now...

506
00:26:28,546 --> 00:26:29,713
tell me what
you think.

507
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,968
Okay, but I'm not sure
you're going to like it.

508
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,720
Tell me.

509
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,889
I think that the situation
with Gowron

510
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:40,974
is a symptom
of a bigger problem.

511
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,976
The Klingon Empire is dying

512
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:45,145
and I think
it deserves to die.

513
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:48,148
You were right.

514
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,109
I do not like it.

515
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,444
Don't get me wrong.

516
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:53,737
I'm very touched
that you still consider me

517
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,655
to be a member
of the House of Martok

518
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,615
but... I tend to look
at the Empire

519
00:26:57,615 --> 00:27:00,369
with a little more skepticism
than Curzon or Jadzia did.

520
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:04,706
I see a society that is
in deep denial about itself.

521
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,959
We're talking
about a warrior culture

522
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:09,378
that prides itself
on maintaining

523
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:12,089
centuries-old traditions
of honor and integrity

524
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:14,467
but, in reality,
it's willing

525
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:16,427
to accept corruption
at the highest levels.

526
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:18,011
You are overstating your case.

527
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,013
Am I?

528
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:22,600
Who was the last leader of the
High Council that you respected?

529
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:25,643
Has there
even been one?

530
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:27,313
And how many times
have you had to cover up

531
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:29,064
the crimes of Klingon leaders

532
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,525
because you were told that it
was for the good of the Empire?

533
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:35,946
I... I know this sounds harsh,
but the truth is

534
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:37,655
you have been willing
to accept a government

535
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:38,865
that you know is corrupt.

536
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:41,327
Gowron is just
the latest example.

537
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:42,702
Worf

538
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:45,581
you are the most honorable
and decent man

539
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,541
that I have ever met

540
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,960
and if you are willing
to tolerate men like Gowron

541
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,588
then what hope is there
for the Empire?

542
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:24,702
We have a prisoner

543
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:26,704
for the Vorta
who commands this ship.

544
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,753
Everything seems
to be in order

545
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,589
but you'll have to
leave your weapons here.

546
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:36,923
Why?

547
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,800
New orders from
Dominion Headquarters--

548
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,927
no armed Cardassians allowed
aboard Jem'Hadar vessels.

549
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:43,889
It sounds like they don't
trust us anymore.

550
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,641
So it would seem.

551
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:47,518
I'm sorry, but those
are the orders.

552
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:48,810
Well, it's not your fault.

553
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,437
Do as he says.

554
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:53,065
The three of us should be able
to handle one Bajoran woman.

555
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,567
Take them
to the Bridge.

556
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,243
Good luck...

557
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,705
Legate Damar.

558
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,973
(<i> hatch closes</i> )

559
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,779
We'll run the first test firing
in two hours, 14 minutes.

560
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,781
Agreed.

561
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,075
Coordinate it
with Central Operations.

562
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:46,159
What's this?

563
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,202
We have a prisoner.

564
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,662
I can see that.

565
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:49,871
Why are you
bringing her to me?

566
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:50,997
This is Commander Rota

567
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:52,874
the Deputy
Intelligence Officer

568
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,126
for this entire sector.

569
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:55,794
I would think that
you'd be interested

570
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,463
in interrogating her.

571
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:59,632
I wasn't informed of this.

572
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:01,007
Perhaps you haven't
received the report yet.

573
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,092
It's not surprising.

574
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:03,427
We only took

575
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:04,844
the Commander
prisoner yesterday.

576
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,263
We were under
a communications blackout...

577
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:07,473
Let me see your orders.

578
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:08,807
Of course.

579
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,602
Founder.

580
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:13,186
You honor us with your presence.

581
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:15,481
I... had no idea
you were in this sector.

582
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:18,609
My movements are
none of your concern.

583
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:19,777
No.

584
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:27,618
Have you begun the interrogation
of this prisoner?

585
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:28,952
Not yet.

586
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,287
Good.

587
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:32,706
I will conduct
the questioning myself.

588
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:34,082
As you wish.

589
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:37,753
Ah... I see
the upgraded plasma rifles

590
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:39,045
have been distributed.

591
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:42,048
May I inspect it?

592
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:45,927
Aha.

593
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,180
An excellent weapon.

594
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,807
What do you think?

595
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:00,776
Secure
those hatches.

596
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:09,493
It wasn't necessary
to kill them all.

597
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:11,953
We can't afford to be
burdened by prisoners.

598
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,789
We'll argue about this later.

599
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:17,167
Prepare to flood all decks below
the Bridge with neurazine gas.

600
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:18,711
Bring the warp drive on line.

601
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:20,879
Lay in a course
for the Federation.

602
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:21,839
Commander.

603
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:23,048
They haven't

604
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:24,758
finished installing
the Breen weapon.

605
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:27,052
We can't leave.

606
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:38,021
How long before they finish
installing the weapon?

607
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,356
We can't wait!

608
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:40,691
I'm not leaving
without that weapon.

609
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:42,067
GARAK:
There are three...

610
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,528
no, four Breen working
in the engine room.

611
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:47,823
Judging from the diagnostics,
I'd say it'll take them

612
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:50,283
30 to 45 minutes
to complete their work.

613
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,785
We don't have that much time.

614
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:53,161
Yes, we do.

615
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,996
No one even knows
we're on the Bridge.

616
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,707
All we have to do is sit tight

617
00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:59,251
give the standard replies
to any inquiries

618
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:00,293
and wait for the Breen to do

619
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,336
their work.

620
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,629
Damar, this is insane.

621
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,423
She'll get us all killed.

622
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:05,674
There's an incoming message.

623
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:10,804
They want to speak
to the Vorta.

624
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,100
(<i> sighs</i> )

625
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,812
Disable the visual feed.

626
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:20,021
What was her name?

627
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,399
Come on!

628
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,776
I'm looking.

629
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:28,029
Ah. Her name was Luaran.

630
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,574
This is Luaran.

631
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:33,869
No, I can't see you either.

632
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:36,789
We're experiencing trouble
with our com system.

633
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:39,541
What do you want?

634
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:40,626
Just a moment.

635
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:42,544
They want

636
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:44,546
the status report on
our navigational array.

637
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:45,631
I've got it.

638
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,176
That data is coming to you.

639
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,178
Excellent.

640
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:54,347
We'll be repairing
our com system

641
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,015
for at least the next hour.

642
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:58,351
I'll contact you
when we're finished.

643
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,895
Luaran out.

644
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:01,354
What if they didn't believe you?

645
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:04,441
Then we're dead.

646
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,251
(<i> sighs</i> )

647
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:27,213
Hey.

648
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:28,799
Hey.

649
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,927
Keiko whipped you
up some crab rolls.

650
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:34,053
She... well,<i> we</i> thought
you might be hungry.

651
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:35,597
Thanks...

652
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:36,807
uh, to both of you.

653
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:40,644
Uh, about the other day...

654
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:41,770
Oh, forget it.

655
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,898
How's the work going?

656
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:47,776
I'm still firmly entrenched
in square one.

657
00:33:50,863 --> 00:33:52,531
You mind
if I ask you a question?

658
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:53,740
About 31?

659
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,702
Go ahead.

660
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:58,620
Well, if you were
to find the cure

661
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,372
and they got to know about it...

662
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,999
what do you think they'd do?

663
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:05,544
Well, I imagine they'd be, uh...
very concerned.

664
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:07,629
The very existence
of a cure

665
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,673
would jeopardize their plan
to eradicate the Founders.

666
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:11,967
Wouldn't surprise me
if Sloan or another operative

667
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:14,511
turned up here on the station
to destroy my work.

668
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:16,179
What are you getting at?

669
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:20,017
I think you should send
a message to Starfleet Medical

670
00:34:20,017 --> 00:34:21,852
saying that you<i> have</i> found
the cure.

671
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:25,731
You're trying to lure someone
from Section 31?

672
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:28,107
Yeah. That's right.

673
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:30,027
What happens when this operative
gets here?

674
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,612
We capture him.

675
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,322
Then we figure out a way

676
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,490
to get some information
out of him.

677
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:39,369
He may not know anything
about the disease.

678
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:40,746
Maybe not...

679
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:42,664
but I bet he knows who does.

680
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:44,165
What do you think?

681
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,752
I think it's a plan...

682
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:49,004
a very good plan.

683
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:50,129
When did you get

684
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:51,506
so devious?

685
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,216
I've been hanging around you
too long.

686
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,510
Let's just hope
this works

687
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,803
and we cure Odo.

688
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,180
That's all I care about.

689
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,891
Me, too, Miles.

690
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:05,062
GOWRON:
Our next target...

691
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:07,397
Sarpedion V.

692
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:11,693
Sarpedion is the headquarters
of the entire 12th Order.

693
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:16,073
Yes. You'll take 15
Vor'cha-class battle cruisers
in first

694
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:17,741
to soften their defenses.

695
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:18,992
Then, General Chu'vok, you'll...

696
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:20,368
Chancellor!

697
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,162
That world is one of the most

698
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:26,750
heavily fortified positions
in the entire Cardassian Empire.

699
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,335
15 battle cruisers
will barely

700
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,504
scratch their defenses.

701
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,965
(<i> chuckles</i> )

702
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:36,259
If you lack the courage
to fight an uphill battle

703
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:40,597
then perhaps you should
retire to your bed.

704
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:49,272
I will fight any battle...

705
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:50,899
anywhere.

706
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,076
For the Empire.

707
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:03,703
Spoken like a true warrior.

708
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:10,502
After Martok has softened
their defenses...

709
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:11,586
No.

710
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,007
We cannot attack Sarpedion.

711
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:19,094
I decide what can...

712
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:23,015
and cannot be done.

713
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:26,893
You rule without wisdom
<i>and</i> without honor.

714
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,603
The warriors that
are gathered here

715
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:31,356
would not say this
to you, but I will.

716
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:34,567
You are squandering our ships
and our lives

717
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,361
on a petty act of vengeance!

718
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:39,698
I should've known better
than to trust you again.

719
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,700
If you were
a true Klingon

720
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,077
I would kill you
where you stand!

721
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:46,746
Fortunately for you

722
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:53,045
that...<i> child's</i> uniform shields
you from your rightful fate.

723
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,719
What I say now

724
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:03,262
I say as a member of
the House of Martok

725
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:05,140
not a Starfleet officer.

726
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:10,562
You have dishonored yourself

727
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:13,481
and the Empire, and
you are not worthy

728
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,441
to lead the Council.

729
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,777
There can be only one answer
to that.

730
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,705
Worf...

731
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:30,707
this is madness.

732
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:38,965
(<i> growling</i> )

733
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:49,184
(<i> grunting</i> )

734
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:03,656
(<i> growling</i> )

735
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,039
(<i> screaming</i> )

736
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:21,758
(<i> yelling</i> )

737
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:33,228
You will not have this... day.

738
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,578
(<i> roaring</i> )

739
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:59,671
Hail Worf!

740
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,506
Leader of the Empire.

741
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:02,924
Worf!

742
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:05,760
(<i> all chanting</i> ):
Worf! Worf! Worf!

743
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,553
Worf! Worf!

744
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:08,554
Wait.

745
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:09,514
Worf!

746
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:10,682
Hear me. Hear me!

747
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,184
Worf... !

748
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:14,769
What I have done...

749
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,771
was for the Empire.

750
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:20,108
A new day must dawn
for our people.

751
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:23,611
I am not the man
to usher in that day

752
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:27,782
but there<i> is</i> a man here who can.

753
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:29,868
Worf...

754
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:32,495
I do not seek the leadership.

755
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:37,042
Kahless said, "Great
men do not seek power.

756
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:41,629
They have power
thrust upon them."

757
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,887
Hail Martok!

758
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:52,057
Leader of the Empire.

759
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:55,101
Leader of destiny.

760
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:11,492
How much longer?

761
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,744
I'm not certain.

762
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,162
It appears
they're having problems

763
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:15,663
connecting the secondary relays.

764
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:18,791
(<i> grunts</i> )

765
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,001
Odo, are you all right?

766
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:21,878
Yes.

767
00:40:21,878 --> 00:40:24,256
Don't worry. I'm...

768
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:26,174
(<i> groaning</i> )

769
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:34,599
I'm... I'm sorry.

770
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:37,894
There's nothing
to be sorry about.

771
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:39,687
(<i> groans</i> )

772
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,522
Just... stay
with me, Odo.

773
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:43,191
Stay with me.

774
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:44,776
We're going to get out of here.

775
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:47,153
All right? Just hang on
a little while longer.

776
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,529
RUSOT:
It's over.

777
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,198
Shut up, Rusot.

778
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:51,908
The shape-shifter
is useless.

779
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:53,076
The whole plan
is coming apart.

780
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:54,202
We have to get
out of here now.

781
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:55,536
Go back to
your post.

782
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,247
No. No more.

783
00:40:57,247 --> 00:40:58,331
We're leaving<i> now.</i>

784
00:40:58,331 --> 00:41:00,708
That would be unwise.

785
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:05,755
You're still a Cardassian,
Garak.

786
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:07,132
You're not going to kill
one of your own people

787
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:08,466
for a Bajoran woman.

788
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,551
How little
you understand me.

789
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:13,388
Put your weapons
down, both of you!

790
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:14,847
You want her dead,
too, Damar.

791
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,057
I know you do.

792
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:18,435
But you're the leader
of the rebellion

793
00:41:18,435 --> 00:41:20,895
and don't want to kill someone
wearing a Starfleet uniform.

794
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,563
Let me do it for you.

795
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:24,149
(<i> beeping</i> )

796
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:26,525
They've finished installing
the dampening weapon.

797
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,861
Then let's<i> all</i> get
the hell out of here.

798
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:29,779
Not you.

799
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:32,157
I'm still here, Rusot.

800
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:33,866
Damar, shoot<i> him.</i>

801
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:36,202
We can kill them both and keep
the Breen weapon for ourselves.

802
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:37,870
I believe in you, Damar.

803
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,747
I know you're the right man

804
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,125
to restore the Empire
we so loyally served

805
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:44,627
the Empire we loved.

806
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,379
Together, we can
lead our people

807
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:47,964
to greatness again.

808
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:50,716
Just aim and fire.

809
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,100
(<i> groaning, loud thud</i> )

810
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:08,193
He was my friend...

811
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:10,569
(<i> sighing</i> )

812
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:12,155
but his Cardassia is dead

813
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:14,407
and it won't be coming back.

814
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,668
Flood all compartments
with the gas.

815
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:33,634
Clear all moorings.

816
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:39,140
Bow thrusters ahead full.

817
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:53,321
We've cleared
their defense perimeter.

818
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:57,742
(<i> breathing heavily</i> )

819
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:00,786
Take the helm.

820
00:43:20,473 --> 00:43:23,851
You're... probably angry.

821
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:26,145
Why?

822
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:28,147
I...

823
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:31,025
I hid my true condition.

824
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:35,113
Odo... I've known all along.

825
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:38,991
But it's not over.

826
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:41,619
Julian's probably working
on a cure right now.

827
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,956
Shh, shh. Nerys,
Nerys, don't.

828
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:46,958
Just...

829
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:49,835
stay here... with me.
