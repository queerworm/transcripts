1
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:06,939
Am I doing it right?

2
00:00:06,975 --> 00:00:09,243
You don't have to be
quite so gentle.

3
00:00:10,852 --> 00:00:12,982
Tell me again.

4
00:00:13,024 --> 00:00:14,892
Tell you about what?

5
00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:17,128
About the stem bolts.

6
00:00:17,168 --> 00:00:24,312
I have 100 gross of
self-sealing stem bolts

7
00:00:24,354 --> 00:00:27,522
sitting in Cargo Bay 11.

8
00:00:27,562 --> 00:00:29,328
And they're all mine?

9
00:00:29,367 --> 00:00:33,036
For only ten bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

10
00:00:33,076 --> 00:00:35,878
Quark, you don't know
how much this means to me.

11
00:00:35,917 --> 00:00:38,047
You don't know how much
this means to me.

12
00:00:38,089 --> 00:00:39,058
With those stem bolts

13
00:00:39,091 --> 00:00:40,789
my family will be able
to triple production

14
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,528
of our reverse-ratcheting
routing planers.

15
00:00:42,568 --> 00:00:44,562
Glad to be of help.

16
00:00:44,606 --> 00:00:49,381
Oh, Quark, I can't wait
any longer.

17
00:00:49,419 --> 00:00:54,991
Why don't you and I
go down to Cargo Bay 11 and...

18
00:00:55,033 --> 00:00:57,369
sign the contract?

19
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,105
No need to rush.

20
00:01:00,146 --> 00:01:02,948
Your family's ship
won't be here for a week.

21
00:01:02,988 --> 00:01:05,050
We'll have plenty of time

22
00:01:05,093 --> 00:01:09,730
to finalize the deal
before then.

23
00:01:09,771 --> 00:01:12,939
That's an unusual attitude
for a Ferengi.

24
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:17,481
I'm a very unusual Ferengi.

25
00:01:19,363 --> 00:01:22,269
That must be the Saurian brandy
I ordered.

26
00:01:22,304 --> 00:01:23,603
Enter.

27
00:01:25,145 --> 00:01:27,845
Rom, where's my brandy?

28
00:01:27,885 --> 00:01:29,377
Forget the brandy, Brother.

29
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:31,018
You must leave here immediately.

30
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,894
And that goes
for the female as well.

31
00:01:32,931 --> 00:01:34,526
Is something wrong?

32
00:01:34,569 --> 00:01:36,506
There's nothing wrong.

33
00:01:38,379 --> 00:01:40,647
Have you lost your mind?

34
00:01:40,685 --> 00:01:42,485
She's willing, she's wealthy

35
00:01:42,523 --> 00:01:44,825
and she wants to buy
our stem bolts.

36
00:01:44,863 --> 00:01:46,458
It's going to have to wait.

37
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,334
Something important has come up.

38
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:51,344
Right now, nothing is more
important than this.

39
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,191
Grand Nagus Zek.

40
00:01:56,226 --> 00:01:58,163
As big as life.

41
00:02:00,102 --> 00:02:01,970
Go, go!

42
00:02:13,537 --> 00:02:15,337
What does Zek want with me?

43
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:18,349
Looks like he's moving
in with you, Brother.

44
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:19,749
Oh...

45
00:04:22,044 --> 00:04:23,776
Sisko to Bashir.

46
00:04:23,815 --> 00:04:24,943
This is Bashir.

47
00:04:24,985 --> 00:04:28,518
Doctor, please report
to the Wardroom immediately.

48
00:04:29,864 --> 00:04:30,855
On my way.

49
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,320
What's this?

50
00:04:39,422 --> 00:04:41,758
Champagne.

51
00:04:41,795 --> 00:04:43,766
Congratulations, Doctor.

52
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,826
Well, thank you.

53
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:48,174
Now, will someone please tell me
what's going on?

54
00:04:48,211 --> 00:04:50,045
The Federation Medical
Council has announced

55
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,054
the nominees for this year's
Carrington Award.

56
00:04:52,089 --> 00:04:53,855
And the nominees are...

57
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:56,833
Dr. April Wade
of the University of Nairobi.

58
00:04:56,867 --> 00:04:58,838
Healer Senva
of the Vulcan Medical Institute

59
00:04:58,872 --> 00:05:01,572
Dr. Henri Roget
of the Central Hospital

60
00:05:01,614 --> 00:05:03,106
of Altair IV

61
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:06,181
Chirurgeon Ghee P'Trell
of Andoria

62
00:05:06,225 --> 00:05:09,758
and Dr. Julian Bashir,
Chief Medical Officer

63
00:05:09,801 --> 00:05:12,296
of Starbase Deep Space 9.

64
00:05:14,513 --> 00:05:15,482
Good luck.

65
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:16,678
There must be some mistake.

66
00:05:16,719 --> 00:05:17,688
As far as I know

67
00:05:17,722 --> 00:05:19,556
my name wasn't even
up for consideration.

68
00:05:19,594 --> 00:05:20,995
Oh, it was up for consideration.

69
00:05:21,031 --> 00:05:22,000
I submitted it myself

70
00:05:22,033 --> 00:05:23,525
through an old friend
of Curzon's.

71
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,906
You deserve the nomination,
Doctor.

72
00:05:25,943 --> 00:05:28,575
Your work
on biomolecular replication

73
00:05:28,617 --> 00:05:31,283
was both audacious
and groundbreaking.

74
00:05:32,627 --> 00:05:34,187
According to Dax, anyway.

75
00:05:34,231 --> 00:05:36,635
She's the only one
who understands it.

76
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:38,699
So how does it feel to be
the youngest nominee

77
00:05:38,743 --> 00:05:40,509
in the history
of the Carrington Award?

78
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,952
It feels... good.

79
00:05:45,661 --> 00:05:47,598
Excuse me.

80
00:05:47,632 --> 00:05:49,262
I've got to finish some work.

81
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:03,764
What exactly is it
you want me to say?

82
00:06:03,808 --> 00:06:05,038
I want you to say that you

83
00:06:05,078 --> 00:06:07,072
are thrilled beyond
belief to be nominated

84
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,748
for the Federation's most
prestigious medical award.

85
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:12,263
Well, believe me, I'm honored
to have been nominated.

86
00:06:12,297 --> 00:06:13,630
Well, you're not acting like it.

87
00:06:14,636 --> 00:06:15,605
It's just
that I don't want everyone

88
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:16,767
to make a big deal out of it.

89
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:18,939
It is a big deal.

90
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,540
We're all proud of you.

91
00:06:20,585 --> 00:06:23,057
I'm glad, but before you agonize
over the next few days

92
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,185
over the board's decision

93
00:06:24,228 --> 00:06:26,358
I want to assure you
that I'm not going to win.

94
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,460
You don't know that.

95
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,804
The work you've been doing
deserves to be recognized.

96
00:06:29,843 --> 00:06:31,210
But this isn't about my work.

97
00:06:31,246 --> 00:06:33,342
Do you know what the
average life expectancy

98
00:06:33,384 --> 00:06:35,618
of a Carrington Award
winner is? Five years.

99
00:06:35,657 --> 00:06:37,856
Ten at the very best...
and do you know why?

100
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,233
Because the Carrington
Award is intended to be

101
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:42,969
the crowning achievement
for a lifetime in medicine.

102
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,844
April Wade is 106.

103
00:06:44,882 --> 00:06:46,910
The last time she was
nominated, three years ago

104
00:06:46,953 --> 00:06:48,183
people said it was premature.

105
00:06:48,223 --> 00:06:49,522
You're exaggerating.

106
00:06:49,593 --> 00:06:52,431
Maybe... a little.

107
00:06:52,468 --> 00:06:54,530
But the undeniable truth
is I am way too young

108
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,770
to be a serious contender
for the Carrington.

109
00:06:56,812 --> 00:06:59,307
Now, put my name up
for nomination in 70 years

110
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:02,953
and I promise you,
I will get very excited.

111
00:07:02,995 --> 00:07:05,490
But until then, I don't plan
on giving it much thought.

112
00:07:05,535 --> 00:07:07,267
That's a very mature attitude.

113
00:07:07,307 --> 00:07:08,503
You sound surprised.

114
00:07:08,576 --> 00:07:11,914
I'm actually astonished
but impressed.

115
00:07:11,952 --> 00:07:13,319
So then we don't
have to dwell on it

116
00:07:13,355 --> 00:07:14,324
for the next three days.

117
00:07:14,358 --> 00:07:15,657
I won't mention it again.

118
00:07:15,695 --> 00:07:17,255
I appreciate that, Jadzia.

119
00:07:17,299 --> 00:07:19,236
So who do you think's going
to win... Wade or P'Trell?

120
00:07:27,994 --> 00:07:31,458
A cup of millipede juice,
hold the shells.

121
00:07:42,431 --> 00:07:43,832
Rom!

122
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:53,219
Rom! Rom!

123
00:07:57,002 --> 00:07:58,130
Did you call me, Brother?

124
00:07:58,172 --> 00:07:59,436
Would it be too much trouble

125
00:07:59,475 --> 00:08:00,910
for you to put
these empty bottles

126
00:08:00,945 --> 00:08:01,914
in the replicator?

127
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,578
Keeping my quarter's clean
is Nog's job.

128
00:08:03,653 --> 00:08:07,322
Except Nog is on the homeworld
visiting his grandmother.

129
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,561
Then cleaning
will just have to wait

130
00:08:09,601 --> 00:08:10,570
until he gets back.

131
00:08:10,604 --> 00:08:11,766
No, it won't!

132
00:08:11,807 --> 00:08:14,473
Until the Nagus gives me
back my own quarters

133
00:08:14,514 --> 00:08:17,009
this is my home, too,
and I have had enough

134
00:08:17,054 --> 00:08:18,080
of this mess.

135
00:08:18,124 --> 00:08:19,423
Clean it up now.

136
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,429
I won't.

137
00:08:20,462 --> 00:08:22,092
Yes, you will.

138
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:24,572
It's bad enough
I've had to put up

139
00:08:24,607 --> 00:08:27,911
with your constant
teeth-grinding every night

140
00:08:27,948 --> 00:08:29,417
and your incessant ear-picking

141
00:08:29,453 --> 00:08:31,948
but I will not tolerate
living like some...

142
00:08:31,993 --> 00:08:34,831
some Pakled refuse
merchant for another...

143
00:08:34,866 --> 00:08:36,666
Wait a minute.

144
00:08:36,704 --> 00:08:39,872
This is a bottle
of Aldebaran whiskey.

145
00:08:39,914 --> 00:08:40,779
Let me, Brother.

146
00:08:40,815 --> 00:08:42,045
I recognize this label.

147
00:08:42,085 --> 00:08:43,680
This is from my private stock.

148
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:44,692
No, it's not.

149
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:47,254
It most certainly is.

150
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:49,099
Wait a minute.

151
00:08:49,137 --> 00:08:52,704
What's that over there, hmm?

152
00:08:52,813 --> 00:08:54,443
Trixian bubble juice?

153
00:08:54,484 --> 00:08:56,250
Nog's favorite.

154
00:08:58,595 --> 00:09:01,227
This came from my stockroom,
didn't it?

155
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:03,605
Are you accusing my son
of being a thief?

156
00:09:03,641 --> 00:09:04,940
No.

157
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:09,252
I'm accusing you
of being a thief.

158
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:10,987
These table linens...

159
00:09:11,027 --> 00:09:12,326
this chair...

160
00:09:12,364 --> 00:09:13,526
that table...

161
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:16,439
everything in here
comes from my bar.

162
00:09:16,475 --> 00:09:18,309
Not everything.

163
00:09:18,346 --> 00:09:19,713
When you're done cleaning up

164
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,552
I'm going to conduct
a complete inventory

165
00:09:22,591 --> 00:09:28,061
and find out exactly what
you've stolen from me.

166
00:09:28,105 --> 00:09:29,199
Now, get to work.

167
00:09:29,241 --> 00:09:30,973
No.

168
00:09:31,012 --> 00:09:32,983
I refuse.

169
00:09:33,017 --> 00:09:34,350
I work for you

170
00:09:34,388 --> 00:09:36,986
all day, Brother,
but here, I'm the boss.

171
00:09:37,028 --> 00:09:40,002
If you want this place
cleaned up, do it yourself.

172
00:09:40,036 --> 00:09:42,942
What I want is
my own quarters back.

173
00:09:42,976 --> 00:09:44,708
That makes two of us.

174
00:09:47,488 --> 00:09:50,017
Living with you was bad enough
when we were children.

175
00:09:50,062 --> 00:09:51,622
What do I do?

176
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,158
You... think.

177
00:09:53,204 --> 00:09:54,571
What do you mean, I "think"?

178
00:09:54,607 --> 00:09:57,638
You stay up late every night,
plotting and scheming.

179
00:09:57,682 --> 00:09:59,585
And when you think, you mumble.

180
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,352
And if there's anything
I can't stand

181
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,759
it's listening to you mumble.

182
00:10:02,795 --> 00:10:04,698
That does it.

183
00:10:04,733 --> 00:10:08,071
I have been accommodating
long enough.

184
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,840
If the Nagus wants
to stay on the station

185
00:10:09,946 --> 00:10:13,979
he's going to have to find
someplace else to live.

186
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:23,878
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

187
00:10:23,917 --> 00:10:25,683
No one's seen the Nagus
since he got here.

188
00:10:25,721 --> 00:10:27,487
He must be working
on something important.

189
00:10:27,525 --> 00:10:29,793
If you disturb him,
he might get very angry.

190
00:10:29,832 --> 00:10:31,392
I'm not going to disturb him.

191
00:10:31,436 --> 00:10:32,700
You are.

192
00:10:32,739 --> 00:10:33,901
Me? Why not you?

193
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:35,912
Zek likes me

194
00:10:35,948 --> 00:10:37,919
so I can't afford
to get on his bad side.

195
00:10:37,953 --> 00:10:39,183
On the other hand

196
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:41,319
he barely acknowledges
your existence.

197
00:10:41,362 --> 00:10:43,698
So, you have nothing to lose.

198
00:10:43,734 --> 00:10:44,794
Now, get in there

199
00:10:44,837 --> 00:10:46,933
and tell the Nagus
he'll have to leave.

200
00:10:46,977 --> 00:10:48,743
And whatever happens

201
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:52,347
don't let Maihar'du
intimidate you, hmm?

202
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,088
Where are you going?

203
00:10:54,128 --> 00:10:55,188
Don't worry.

204
00:10:55,231 --> 00:10:58,033
If you need me,
I'll be close by.

205
00:10:59,174 --> 00:11:01,077
Rom!

206
00:11:01,113 --> 00:11:03,415
What can I do for you, my boy?

207
00:11:03,452 --> 00:11:04,443
Grand Nagus

208
00:11:04,488 --> 00:11:07,052
forgive me for disturbing you.

209
00:11:07,095 --> 00:11:08,394
Who's disturbed?

210
00:11:08,432 --> 00:11:11,600
I've been hoping
someone would drop by.

211
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,939
Now, come right in.

212
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,878
Why, thank you.

213
00:11:14,915 --> 00:11:16,316
We'd be delighted.

214
00:11:16,352 --> 00:11:23,292
Quark, I knew you'd be
lurking around here someplace.

215
00:11:25,242 --> 00:11:27,976
Well, what are we
standing out here for?

216
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:32,618
I've got something very exciting
to show you both.

217
00:11:32,661 --> 00:11:35,099
What happened to my furniture?

218
00:11:35,134 --> 00:11:36,330
I got rid of it.

219
00:11:36,371 --> 00:11:38,137
It was getting in the way
of my work.

220
00:11:38,175 --> 00:11:40,841
And what work was that,
Grand Nagus?

221
00:11:40,883 --> 00:11:42,786
If I may be so bold?

222
00:11:42,821 --> 00:11:46,023
I'm glad you asked.

223
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,292
Maihar'du!

224
00:11:49,405 --> 00:11:50,806
The book.

225
00:11:54,251 --> 00:11:59,322
You are about to read
the shining triumph of my life

226
00:11:59,364 --> 00:12:03,671
the one thing I'll
always be remembered for.

227
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:05,509
May I?

228
00:12:05,547 --> 00:12:07,849
By all means.

229
00:12:11,295 --> 00:12:13,859
<i>"The Rules of Acquisition</i>

230
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:16,373
<i>revised for</i>
<i>the modern Ferengi. "

231
00:12:16,408 --> 00:12:19,246
You rewrote
the Rules of Acquisition.

232
00:12:19,282 --> 00:12:21,253
I hope you like them.

233
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:23,258
Absorb...

234
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:25,422
enjoy.

235
00:12:25,465 --> 00:12:28,598
Rom, do you know
what this means?

236
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,908
Yes, it means we're going
to have to memorize

237
00:12:30,946 --> 00:12:32,610
a whole new set of Rules.

238
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:33,949
No, you idiot.

239
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:36,551
It means we'll be
the first Ferengi

240
00:12:36,594 --> 00:12:38,588
to benefit from Zek's wisdom.

241
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:41,105
The knowledge
contained in this book

242
00:12:41,173 --> 00:12:44,842
could make us both rich
beyond our wildest dreams.

243
00:12:44,882 --> 00:12:47,116
I'll be able to go
into business for myself?

244
00:12:47,154 --> 00:12:48,123
Mm-hmm.

245
00:12:48,224 --> 00:12:50,696
Turn the page, Brother,
turn the page.

246
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,667
The First Rule of Acquisition
is...

247
00:12:52,702 --> 00:12:54,137
Go on.

248
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:55,676
"If they want their money
back...

249
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,679
Yes, yes.

250
00:12:56,713 --> 00:12:57,841
...give it to them."

251
00:12:57,883 --> 00:12:59,945
"If they want their money
back...

252
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:02,290
give it to them"?

253
00:13:18,408 --> 00:13:24,219
"Rule Number 21: Never place
profit before friendship."

254
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,200
"Rule Number 22:
Latinum tarnishes

255
00:13:29,236 --> 00:13:31,435
but family is forever."

256
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:38,322
"Rule 23: Money can never
replace dignity."

257
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,023
Oh, skip to the end!

258
00:13:41,836 --> 00:13:42,998
Well, what is it?

259
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,603
Oh, you're not going
to like it, Brother.

260
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:46,705
I can take it.

261
00:13:46,748 --> 00:13:47,774
Tell me.

262
00:13:47,817 --> 00:13:53,993
"Rule Number 285:
A good deed is its own reward."

263
00:13:57,944 --> 00:14:00,006
Brother, are you all right?

264
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:03,616
I... I... I just
have to sit down.

265
00:14:06,332 --> 00:14:08,326
No, take it away!

266
00:14:08,371 --> 00:14:09,340
Sorry.

267
00:14:09,374 --> 00:14:12,006
Got to think.
Got to think.

268
00:14:12,047 --> 00:14:13,607
There has to be some explanation

269
00:14:13,718 --> 00:14:15,518
or reason
for why he's doing this.

270
00:14:15,557 --> 00:14:17,995
Maybe we should ask him.

271
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,625
No. Don't you see?

272
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:21,136
He's testing us.

273
00:14:21,171 --> 00:14:23,108
Yes, that must be it.

274
00:14:23,143 --> 00:14:25,273
It's some kind of test.

275
00:14:25,315 --> 00:14:27,115
The book. The book.

276
00:14:27,153 --> 00:14:29,249
You want to hear more?

277
00:14:29,292 --> 00:14:31,560
No, but it must be
some kind of code.

278
00:14:31,598 --> 00:14:34,834
Read me the first word
of every Rule.

279
00:14:36,577 --> 00:14:41,021
"Lf... never... keep...

280
00:14:41,055 --> 00:14:43,357
"profit... a...

281
00:14:43,395 --> 00:14:48,568
good... smile... honesty."

282
00:14:48,609 --> 00:14:50,580
Enough!

283
00:14:50,614 --> 00:14:55,719
If never keep profit,
a good smile, honesty.

284
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,286
What does it mean, Brother?

285
00:14:57,331 --> 00:15:04,339
It means absolutely nothing.

286
00:15:04,383 --> 00:15:07,380
Maybe if we hold the pages
up to the light.

287
00:15:08,795 --> 00:15:10,561
No, no. Uh...

288
00:15:16,046 --> 00:15:17,676
Ooh!

289
00:15:17,718 --> 00:15:20,350
Ahh! Ahh!

290
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:25,429
Mmm... mmm...

291
00:15:25,471 --> 00:15:27,237
No, that's not it.

292
00:15:27,275 --> 00:15:31,274
The answer must be
right in front of us.

293
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,346
I know!

294
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,949
Maybe the Nagus has gone insane.

295
00:15:33,993 --> 00:15:36,329
Nonsense, the Nagus is the
most brilliant Ferengi alive.

296
00:15:36,366 --> 00:15:37,892
I've modeled my life after him.

297
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:40,670
Don't ever let me
hear you speak that way

298
00:15:40,711 --> 00:15:41,873
about him again.

299
00:15:41,914 --> 00:15:44,386
But what if he really
believes all this?

300
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:46,449
How can he believe
this insanity?

301
00:15:46,492 --> 00:15:48,360
No, it has to be part of some

302
00:15:48,397 --> 00:15:51,269
brilliant, twisted,
devious plan.

303
00:15:51,305 --> 00:15:54,575
The Nagus isn't
like you and me, Rom.

304
00:15:54,613 --> 00:15:58,646
He thinks ten, sometimes
20 steps ahead.

305
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:01,994
These Rules are probably
the key component

306
00:16:02,033 --> 00:16:05,497
in some vast plot
to seize financial control

307
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,409
of the entire Quadrant.

308
00:16:07,446 --> 00:16:08,779
So what do we do?

309
00:16:08,851 --> 00:16:12,884
The only thing we can do.

310
00:16:12,927 --> 00:16:17,030
We put down this book...

311
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:22,749
and we walk away.

312
00:16:22,786 --> 00:16:26,192
And when the Nagus feels ready,
he'll inform us of his plans.

313
00:16:26,228 --> 00:16:29,361
But until then, we have to act
as if we know nothing.

314
00:16:29,404 --> 00:16:31,534
I can do that.

315
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:44,742
If never keep profit,
a good smile, honesty.

316
00:16:44,777 --> 00:16:46,337
Nah.

317
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:47,782
Quark, my boy!

318
00:16:47,818 --> 00:16:50,416
What say we buy everyone
a drink?

319
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:51,859
Put it on my tab.

320
00:16:51,895 --> 00:16:53,798
But why?

321
00:16:53,834 --> 00:16:56,774
Because it will
make everyone happy.

322
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:58,904
And that will make me happy.

323
00:16:59,014 --> 00:17:01,418
It must all be part of his plan.

324
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:03,688
Wheels within wheels, Brother.

325
00:17:03,726 --> 00:17:05,286
Drinks for everyone.

326
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:07,666
Compliments of the Grand Nagus.

327
00:17:10,745 --> 00:17:13,274
Is there anything else
I can get you, Nagus?

328
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:14,810
We just got in a shipment

329
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:16,826
of quality Hupyrian
beetle snuff.

330
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:20,768
Actually, I've lost my taste
for beetle snuff.

331
00:17:20,804 --> 00:17:26,308
It might be fun for you and me,
but it's no fun for the beetles.

332
00:17:26,351 --> 00:17:28,789
Oh, and by the way, Quark

333
00:17:28,824 --> 00:17:32,425
I just met the most lovely
young female.

334
00:17:32,467 --> 00:17:34,769
She came by your quarters
looking for you.

335
00:17:34,807 --> 00:17:36,276
Was her name Emi, by any chance?

336
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,076
She wanted me to tell you

337
00:17:38,115 --> 00:17:41,784
that her family's ship
has arrived with the latinum.

338
00:17:41,825 --> 00:17:43,955
Aha! It's about time!

339
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:45,831
Rom, watch the bar.

340
00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:48,239
We're finally going to get
rid of those stem bolts.

341
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,244
I don't think so.

342
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:50,439
But we have a contract.

343
00:17:50,481 --> 00:17:52,645
Which was never signed.

344
00:17:52,687 --> 00:17:54,989
And frankly, Quark

345
00:17:55,025 --> 00:17:59,401
you were charging an outrageous
price for those stem bolts.

346
00:17:59,437 --> 00:18:01,431
She didn't seem to think so.

347
00:18:01,476 --> 00:18:03,640
Well, she did
once I explained it to her.

348
00:18:03,681 --> 00:18:04,775
You what?

349
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:07,552
Well, I couldn't
allow you to take advantage

350
00:18:07,591 --> 00:18:10,565
of an innocent young female
like that, Quark.

351
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:13,937
So I told her where she could
get all the stem bolts

352
00:18:13,975 --> 00:18:15,741
she needed... at wholesale.

353
00:18:18,052 --> 00:18:20,524
Wholesale?

354
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:25,003
He told her where to get
them at wholesale.

355
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,802
What am I going to do

356
00:18:26,842 --> 00:18:29,907
with a hundred gross
of stem bolts?

357
00:18:32,489 --> 00:18:34,015
My poor brother.

358
00:18:34,094 --> 00:18:36,031
Oh, don't worry about him.

359
00:18:36,099 --> 00:18:39,335
Eventually, he'll sell
those stem bolts...

360
00:18:39,374 --> 00:18:40,638
at a fair price.

361
00:18:40,677 --> 00:18:41,941
A fair price?

362
00:18:41,981 --> 00:18:43,747
Ah, I'm very confused.

363
00:18:43,785 --> 00:18:45,881
That's understandable.

364
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:50,562
It'll take some time
to get used to the new ways.

365
00:18:50,603 --> 00:18:52,973
New ways...

366
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:55,038
Walk with me, Rom.

367
00:19:09,017 --> 00:19:10,509
Your turn.

368
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:13,996
Ah, I don't know about this.

369
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:16,730
Would you rather play
a game of racquetball?

370
00:19:16,771 --> 00:19:19,175
Chief, since Keiko's
been on Bajor

371
00:19:19,211 --> 00:19:21,911
we've played 106 games
of racquetball.

372
00:19:21,951 --> 00:19:23,581
Right. So throw a dart.

373
00:19:24,524 --> 00:19:27,019
I'm a bit rusty.

374
00:19:27,064 --> 00:19:28,932
So am I.

375
00:19:28,969 --> 00:19:31,305
I guess the smart money's
on Wade or P'Trell.

376
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:36,650
That seems to be
the general consensus.

377
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:37,954
I mean...

378
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:40,727
Doctor Wade is very popular

379
00:19:40,767 --> 00:19:43,239
but P'Trell is doing
some amazing work

380
00:19:43,273 --> 00:19:44,765
in gerontological research.

381
00:19:46,415 --> 00:19:48,477
Which one do you
think will win?

382
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,153
Either of them would be a worthy
recipient of the Carrington.

383
00:19:51,227 --> 00:19:52,491
Oh. Of course,
if I had my druthers

384
00:19:52,531 --> 00:19:54,229
the Award would go to you.

385
00:19:57,042 --> 00:19:58,011
Thank you.

386
00:19:58,045 --> 00:19:59,948
But let's face it.

387
00:19:59,983 --> 00:20:02,717
You don't stand a chance.

388
00:20:04,128 --> 00:20:06,065
You don't say.

389
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,402
I mean, I know
you're talented...

390
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:12,945
but I bet there's doctors
all over the Federation saying

391
00:20:12,984 --> 00:20:15,114
"Julian Bashir,
who the hell is he?"

392
00:20:18,064 --> 00:20:22,508
Chief, you are absolutely right.

393
00:20:23,612 --> 00:20:25,412
I'm glad you agree.

394
00:20:27,355 --> 00:20:28,619
So...

395
00:20:28,658 --> 00:20:31,632
how much longer is Keiko
going to be on Bajor?

396
00:20:39,486 --> 00:20:42,483
Make sure the relief
shipment is sent

397
00:20:42,527 --> 00:20:44,225
by high-warp courier.

398
00:20:44,265 --> 00:20:46,760
And don't worry about the cost.

399
00:20:48,475 --> 00:20:50,105
Rom, what's all this?

400
00:20:50,147 --> 00:20:53,315
You're looking
at the Sector Headquarters

401
00:20:53,355 --> 00:20:56,386
for the Ferengi
Benevolent Association.

402
00:21:07,813 --> 00:21:09,875
Brother, I don't have time
to talk to you.

403
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,149
I have work to do.

404
00:21:11,189 --> 00:21:13,285
I'm the new Senior Administrator

405
00:21:13,327 --> 00:21:15,561
of the Ferengi
Benevolent Association.

406
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,298
You know, Brother, I never
realized how many people

407
00:21:17,337 --> 00:21:18,704
there are that could
use a little help.

408
00:21:18,742 --> 00:21:20,736
If you don't get
down to the bar right now

409
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,648
you're the one going
to need a little help.

410
00:21:22,685 --> 00:21:24,747
The Nagus said
you'd react like this.

411
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,282
The Nagus is a smart man.

412
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:27,319
Oh, he's more than that.

413
00:21:27,363 --> 00:21:28,332
He's a visionary.

414
00:21:28,366 --> 00:21:29,426
He has plans, Brother.

415
00:21:29,469 --> 00:21:31,201
And I'm going to be
a part of them.

416
00:21:31,241 --> 00:21:33,770
What would the Nagus
possibly want with you?

417
00:21:33,814 --> 00:21:36,845
Oh, he says I'm malleable.

418
00:21:36,889 --> 00:21:40,159
And that he's going to mold me
into a new kind of Ferengi...

419
00:21:40,197 --> 00:21:41,827
an evolved Ferengi.

420
00:21:41,868 --> 00:21:43,360
"Evolved"? Into what?

421
00:21:43,405 --> 00:21:44,669
I'm not sure, exactly.

422
00:21:44,709 --> 00:21:46,943
But the Nagus says
that the answers lie

423
00:21:46,981 --> 00:21:48,815
in his new Rules of Acquisition.

424
00:21:48,853 --> 00:21:51,291
He told me, "Rom,
it's time for the Ferengi

425
00:21:51,326 --> 00:21:52,556
to move beyond greed."

426
00:21:52,663 --> 00:21:54,030
Beyond greed?!

427
00:21:54,066 --> 00:21:56,162
There's nothing beyond greed.

428
00:21:56,206 --> 00:21:59,237
Greed is the purest,
most noble of emotions.

429
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:00,475
Greed is dead.

430
00:22:00,516 --> 00:22:01,849
That's the Tenth
Rule of Acquisition.

431
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:03,049
No, it's not.

432
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,358
The Tenth Rule of Acquisition
is "greed is eternal."

433
00:22:05,396 --> 00:22:06,490
Not anymore.

434
00:22:06,532 --> 00:22:08,469
The Nagus is going to shake

435
00:22:08,504 --> 00:22:11,272
the very foundation
of Ferengi society.

436
00:22:11,311 --> 00:22:12,975
And we're going
to be at his side

437
00:22:13,015 --> 00:22:14,177
every step of the way.

438
00:22:14,218 --> 00:22:15,187
What do you mean, "we"?

439
00:22:15,221 --> 00:22:16,690
The Nagus has made you

440
00:22:16,725 --> 00:22:19,493
cochairman
of the Benevolent Association.

441
00:22:19,533 --> 00:22:21,231
Your name will figure
prominently

442
00:22:21,271 --> 00:22:22,706
on all our correspondence.

443
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:25,441
He never mentioned
anything about that to me.

444
00:22:25,481 --> 00:22:27,817
The Nagus wouldn't dream
of excluding you, Brother.

445
00:22:27,854 --> 00:22:29,848
As soon as we get
the Benevolent Association

446
00:22:29,892 --> 00:22:31,088
established here, the Nagus

447
00:22:31,129 --> 00:22:32,724
plans on returning
to the homeworld

448
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:34,259
and we'll go with him.

449
00:22:34,304 --> 00:22:35,398
Think of it.

450
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,778
You and I will be there
when Zek personally announces

451
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:40,616
the new Rules of Acquisition

452
00:22:40,654 --> 00:22:44,187
on the Grand Steps
of the Sacred Marketplace.

453
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,825
We'll be there, all right.

454
00:22:45,868 --> 00:22:48,272
And we'll probably
be right alongside of him

455
00:22:48,307 --> 00:22:50,005
when they throw him
from the Spire

456
00:22:50,045 --> 00:22:51,344
of the Tower of Commerce.

457
00:22:51,382 --> 00:22:53,512
The Tower of Commerce?

458
00:22:53,554 --> 00:22:55,491
But... that's
the tallest building

459
00:22:55,526 --> 00:22:56,927
in the Ferengi Alliance.

460
00:22:56,963 --> 00:23:01,600
A fall from that height
could... could... could...

461
00:23:01,642 --> 00:23:03,579
Exactly.

462
00:23:05,151 --> 00:23:06,711
Don't you see, Rom?

463
00:23:06,755 --> 00:23:09,284
There's something terribly
wrong with the Nagus.

464
00:23:09,328 --> 00:23:11,356
And we have to help him...

465
00:23:11,401 --> 00:23:13,703
before he gets us all killed.

466
00:23:16,914 --> 00:23:19,113
That tickles!

467
00:23:19,154 --> 00:23:20,988
Well, I must say,
for a Ferengi your age

468
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:22,392
you're in excellent health...

469
00:23:22,429 --> 00:23:25,197
aside from some vascular damage
to your mucus membranes.

470
00:23:25,236 --> 00:23:27,264
You really should stop
using that beetle snuff.

471
00:23:27,308 --> 00:23:30,714
As a matter of fact...
I already have.

472
00:23:31,786 --> 00:23:33,050
I'm glad to hear it.

473
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,856
Does this mean
you'll have to go in

474
00:23:34,894 --> 00:23:36,489
for some exploratory surgery?

475
00:23:36,532 --> 00:23:37,592
Why would I do that?

476
00:23:37,636 --> 00:23:39,003
To find out
what's wrong with him.

477
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,634
There's nothing
wrong with him, Quark.

478
00:23:40,676 --> 00:23:41,645
That's not true.

479
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,274
There's something
deeply wrong with him

480
00:23:43,317 --> 00:23:44,809
and you have
to find out what it is.

481
00:23:44,854 --> 00:23:46,380
I've done every test
I can think of.

482
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,416
There's no trauma

483
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,952
brain damage, mental illness.

484
00:23:48,998 --> 00:23:51,596
His central nervous system's
working within normal parameters

485
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,233
and his endocrine system's
in terrific shape.

486
00:23:53,276 --> 00:23:54,836
You see? I told you.

487
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,116
They're like a couple
of nervous investors

488
00:23:58,155 --> 00:24:01,152
always looking for trouble.

489
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:05,703
Oh, well, I suppose
I should be flattered.

490
00:24:05,809 --> 00:24:07,176
Thank you, Doctor.

491
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:09,183
You've been very helpful.

492
00:24:09,217 --> 00:24:10,208
No.

493
00:24:10,253 --> 00:24:11,552
Uh-uh.

494
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,025
He's sick, I tell you.

495
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,054
You have to perform more tests.

496
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:16,329
Quark!

497
00:24:16,368 --> 00:24:17,894
If you don't get out of here

498
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,672
I'll perform more tests on you.

499
00:24:20,713 --> 00:24:21,739
You have to do something.

500
00:24:21,783 --> 00:24:23,082
Like what?

501
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,114
Put him in stasis, keep him
from hurting himself

502
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:27,221
until you can figure out
what is wrong with him.

503
00:24:27,264 --> 00:24:28,392
I don't think that's necessary.

504
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:30,166
I can't believe
you're supposed to be

505
00:24:30,205 --> 00:24:32,734
one of the five best doctors
in the Federation.

506
00:24:32,779 --> 00:24:34,043
If you ask me, you're a quack.

507
00:24:34,082 --> 00:24:36,110
No wonder everyone says
you don't have a chance

508
00:24:36,154 --> 00:24:37,555
to win the Carrington.

509
00:24:39,763 --> 00:24:41,062
Let's go.

510
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,735
Maybe we can make an appointment
for you to see Doctor Wade.

511
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:45,745
Good luck.

512
00:24:45,778 --> 00:24:47,042
If I remember correctly

513
00:24:47,082 --> 00:24:49,611
Nairobi is beautiful
this time of year.

514
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:51,958
Here, Doctor, for your trouble.

515
00:24:51,994 --> 00:24:53,327
I can't accept that.

516
00:24:53,365 --> 00:24:54,834
Why not?
It's only money.

517
00:24:54,936 --> 00:24:57,306
Donate it to charity
if you'd like.

518
00:24:59,147 --> 00:25:01,118
And you say he's not sick.

519
00:25:01,152 --> 00:25:02,416
Oh, and, Doctor

520
00:25:02,455 --> 00:25:05,520
I do hope you'll attend
tomorrow night's ceremony.

521
00:25:05,563 --> 00:25:06,759
Ceremony?

522
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,532
At the Bajoran Shrine
on the Promenade.

523
00:25:08,571 --> 00:25:11,409
I intend to give a gift
to the Bajoran people.

524
00:25:11,445 --> 00:25:13,974
A gift.
What kind of gift?

525
00:25:14,019 --> 00:25:15,454
It's a surprise.

526
00:25:15,489 --> 00:25:19,090
You'll find out tomorrow night,
like everyone else.

527
00:25:19,132 --> 00:25:22,038
Come along, we have a lot
of work to do before then.

528
00:25:22,072 --> 00:25:24,066
So many needy people...

529
00:25:24,112 --> 00:25:25,547
so little time.

530
00:25:34,071 --> 00:25:35,597
Aren't you done yet?

531
00:25:35,641 --> 00:25:37,544
Breaking into the Nagus's
personal shuttle

532
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:38,878
somehow seems wrong, Brother.

533
00:25:38,916 --> 00:25:40,044
I don't care.

534
00:25:40,086 --> 00:25:41,716
I have to know what he intends
to give the Bajorans.

535
00:25:41,757 --> 00:25:43,591
But the Nagus wants
it to be a surprise.

536
00:25:43,629 --> 00:25:44,598
I hate surprises.

537
00:25:44,631 --> 00:25:46,568
Now hurry it up,
before someone...

538
00:25:48,942 --> 00:25:51,278
Maihar'du.

539
00:25:51,315 --> 00:25:53,787
As you can see, my brother and I

540
00:25:53,822 --> 00:25:55,918
were repairing the door locks
on the Nagus's...

541
00:26:22,496 --> 00:26:24,660
This is the gift?

542
00:26:24,701 --> 00:26:26,102
What is it?

543
00:26:26,139 --> 00:26:29,603
It's one of the missing
Bajoran Orbs, Rom.

544
00:26:29,648 --> 00:26:32,212
An Orb of the Prophets.

545
00:26:37,335 --> 00:26:41,072
I tell you, this Orb
explains everything...

546
00:26:41,112 --> 00:26:42,604
Zek's behavior, the new Rules

547
00:26:42,648 --> 00:26:45,280
the Ferengi Benevolent
Association, everything.

548
00:26:45,322 --> 00:26:46,848
It does? How?

549
00:26:46,893 --> 00:26:49,491
I'm not sure,
but I'm going to find out.

550
00:26:49,533 --> 00:26:52,005
Don't just stand there...
talk to me.

551
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:53,938
I know how you feel.

552
00:26:55,374 --> 00:26:56,343
What are you doing?

553
00:26:56,377 --> 00:26:58,075
I thought we should look inside.

554
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,483
I mean, we don't know
for certain

555
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:00,715
that there's an Orb in here.

556
00:27:00,756 --> 00:27:03,126
Maybe Zek's just
giving them the box.

557
00:27:03,162 --> 00:27:04,358
Don't be ridiculous.

558
00:27:04,398 --> 00:27:06,460
But how will we know
unless we look?

559
00:27:06,504 --> 00:27:09,535
Rom, it's too dangerous.
Leave it alone.

560
00:27:09,578 --> 00:27:10,547
But, Brother!

561
00:27:10,581 --> 00:27:11,845
I said leave it alone!

562
00:27:15,795 --> 00:27:19,828
Rom? Maihar'du?

563
00:27:19,872 --> 00:27:21,000
Morn?

564
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:23,309
Anybody?

565
00:27:23,347 --> 00:27:25,147
What's the matter, Quark?

566
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:29,094
Spinning out of control, are we?

567
00:27:29,129 --> 00:27:30,827
Grand Nagus?

568
00:27:30,867 --> 00:27:32,895
Maybe...

569
00:27:35,078 --> 00:27:37,072
maybe not.

570
00:27:49,917 --> 00:27:51,945
Looking for answers?

571
00:27:51,989 --> 00:27:56,228
You couldn't find them if they
were dangling from your lobes.

572
00:27:59,073 --> 00:28:00,167
Where's that old Quark

573
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:03,616
cleverness I've heard
so much about?

574
00:28:03,653 --> 00:28:07,756
Or are you
so paralyzed with fear

575
00:28:07,796 --> 00:28:09,699
that you can't think straight?

576
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:13,608
Answer me, Quark.

577
00:28:13,645 --> 00:28:15,548
What are you so nervous about?

578
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:19,686
Don't you think change
is worth dying for?

579
00:28:19,727 --> 00:28:24,330
All I want
is a little leap of faith.

580
00:28:29,285 --> 00:28:30,515
Nice catch.

581
00:28:32,193 --> 00:28:35,224
That's the wonderful thing
about mysteries.

582
00:28:35,267 --> 00:28:40,646
Sometimes the answers
just fall from the sky.

583
00:28:40,682 --> 00:28:43,086
What do you have to lose?

584
00:28:43,122 --> 00:28:44,352
Open it.

585
00:28:57,859 --> 00:28:59,591
Consider it a gift.

586
00:28:59,631 --> 00:29:03,698
Yes. Yes.

587
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,540
Are you all right?

588
00:29:07,585 --> 00:29:08,986
A gift.

589
00:29:09,022 --> 00:29:10,013
A gift?

590
00:29:10,058 --> 00:29:11,722
Zek said the new Rules
were a gift.

591
00:29:11,762 --> 00:29:13,756
A gift from Zek
to the Ferengi people.

592
00:29:13,801 --> 00:29:17,003
No, a gift to Zek from them.

593
00:29:17,043 --> 00:29:18,012
Don't you see?

594
00:29:18,045 --> 00:29:19,173
They did it.

595
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:21,414
They put the idea for the
new Rules into Zek's head.

596
00:29:21,454 --> 00:29:22,514
They changed him somehow.

597
00:29:22,557 --> 00:29:25,929
They did?
How dare they?

598
00:29:25,966 --> 00:29:27,458
Who are we talking about,
Brother?

599
00:29:27,503 --> 00:29:30,341
The Prophets, the aliens
that live inside the wormhole.

600
00:29:30,377 --> 00:29:32,473
They did this to him,
didn't they?

601
00:29:32,516 --> 00:29:33,985
Tell me everything!

602
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:34,989
Easy, Brother.

603
00:29:35,022 --> 00:29:36,389
You know Hupyrian servants

604
00:29:36,426 --> 00:29:38,625
take a vow only to speak
to their masters.

605
00:29:38,665 --> 00:29:39,656
You're right.

606
00:29:40,838 --> 00:29:42,364
Okay, give him a handkerchief
or something.

607
00:29:42,408 --> 00:29:44,276
I'm going to try to break
into Zek's personal logs.

608
00:29:46,653 --> 00:29:49,593
According to Zek's logs,
he obtained the Orb

609
00:29:49,627 --> 00:29:51,997
from one of his contacts
on Cardassia III.

610
00:29:52,034 --> 00:29:55,236
From there, he headed
straight for the wormhole.

611
00:29:55,275 --> 00:29:59,342
His ship's log shows
that he entered the wormhole

612
00:29:59,385 --> 00:30:01,755
stayed inside
for only a few minutes

613
00:30:01,792 --> 00:30:03,854
then reversed course
and came here.

614
00:30:03,898 --> 00:30:06,370
You think he went in there
to talk to the Prophets?

615
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:09,435
In his personal logs,
Zek said...

616
00:30:11,116 --> 00:30:17,395
that the future was looking
very bright indeed.

617
00:30:19,805 --> 00:30:21,172
Don't you get it?

618
00:30:21,209 --> 00:30:22,178
According to Dax

619
00:30:22,212 --> 00:30:24,650
the wormhole aliens
can see through time.

620
00:30:24,685 --> 00:30:27,249
The Nagus must have thought
that he could convince them

621
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:29,195
to let him see the future.

622
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:32,102
That way, he could anticipate

623
00:30:32,138 --> 00:30:34,736
economic changes
throughout the galaxy.

624
00:30:34,778 --> 00:30:37,512
The opportunity for profit
would have been enormous.

625
00:30:37,551 --> 00:30:41,493
But instead, he created
the new Rules of Acquisition.

626
00:30:41,529 --> 00:30:42,998
Why?

627
00:30:43,066 --> 00:30:45,698
Something must have
gone terribly wrong.

628
00:30:45,739 --> 00:30:49,180
But I intend to set it right.

629
00:30:49,215 --> 00:30:50,947
How, Brother?

630
00:30:50,986 --> 00:30:52,718
I have an idea.

631
00:30:52,758 --> 00:30:54,626
Does it involve me?

632
00:30:54,663 --> 00:30:56,030
Not really.

633
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,766
Ah. I like it.

634
00:31:14,213 --> 00:31:15,739
May I join you, Doctor?

635
00:31:15,784 --> 00:31:17,516
By all means.

636
00:31:17,555 --> 00:31:20,461
And what can I do for you?

637
00:31:20,496 --> 00:31:22,022
It's what I can do for you.

638
00:31:22,134 --> 00:31:24,629
I have a friend
at Starfleet Intelligence

639
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,908
and she has a friend
who has a cousin

640
00:31:26,946 --> 00:31:30,045
who's married to the assistant
of one of the members

641
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:32,216
of the Federation
Medical Council.

642
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,820
Really?

643
00:31:33,864 --> 00:31:37,328
And according to my friend,
her friend heard something

644
00:31:37,373 --> 00:31:39,503
from his cousin
that his wife heard

645
00:31:39,545 --> 00:31:40,980
from the council member

646
00:31:41,016 --> 00:31:43,614
that I thought you might
find interesting.

647
00:31:43,656 --> 00:31:45,354
Which is?

648
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:51,333
Dr. Wade is not going
to win the Carrington.

649
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:53,540
Oh, not you, too.

650
00:31:53,582 --> 00:31:55,986
Doctor, I thought
you'd be delighted.

651
00:31:56,022 --> 00:31:57,116
Even if that's true...

652
00:31:57,225 --> 00:31:59,561
and mind you,
I'm not saying that it is...

653
00:31:59,597 --> 00:32:03,562
the only one that has a reason
to celebrate is Ghee P'Trell.

654
00:32:03,608 --> 00:32:07,014
Perhaps, but P'Trell is by no
means as popular as Dr. Wade.

655
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,953
According to your friend.

656
00:32:08,988 --> 00:32:11,826
Actually, according
to my friend's friend's...

657
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:13,093
I get the picture.

658
00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:16,072
The point is,
if it's not going to be Wade

659
00:32:16,107 --> 00:32:21,577
it could be anyone...
P'Trell, Senva, Roget, even you.

660
00:32:21,622 --> 00:32:24,494
I didn't think
I was going to win before

661
00:32:24,529 --> 00:32:26,625
and I don't think
I'm going to win now.

662
00:32:26,668 --> 00:32:27,898
Is that a fact?

663
00:32:27,938 --> 00:32:32,143
Then why have you been working
on your acceptance speech?

664
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,820
How did you know?

665
00:32:36,861 --> 00:32:39,425
Just a guess.

666
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:57,673
My goodness, I never
realized solar flares

667
00:32:57,715 --> 00:33:01,623
could be so devastating
to a planet's agriculture.

668
00:33:01,659 --> 00:33:04,758
Now, let me see,
at current market rates

669
00:33:04,801 --> 00:33:08,709
2,000 tons of Kohlanese barley

670
00:33:08,744 --> 00:33:13,017
would cost me a 189 bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

671
00:33:13,055 --> 00:33:14,581
But it's worth it.

672
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:17,427
I can have the first
shipment of barley

673
00:33:17,467 --> 00:33:19,165
on the way to you in the...

674
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,301
Hold on, I'll be right back.

675
00:33:21,343 --> 00:33:23,542
How can I help you, boys?

676
00:33:37,452 --> 00:33:38,751
Wait.

677
00:33:38,789 --> 00:33:40,988
I have to be sure
that he's all right.

678
00:33:41,027 --> 00:33:43,261
Grand Nagus, can you hear me?

679
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,269
Are you okay?

680
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:47,469
Don't worry, Quark,
I forgive you.

681
00:33:47,511 --> 00:33:48,946
Do you hear that?

682
00:33:48,981 --> 00:33:50,473
We have to help him.

683
00:33:59,174 --> 00:34:02,148
Brother, this is
a very brave thing

684
00:34:02,182 --> 00:34:03,151
you're doing...

685
00:34:03,185 --> 00:34:05,179
taking the Nagus
back to the wormhole.

686
00:34:05,224 --> 00:34:07,594
I wish I could come with you...
but I can't.

687
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:08,621
Good-bye.

688
00:34:10,538 --> 00:34:13,774
Go on, get out of here
before you have me crying, too.

689
00:34:19,494 --> 00:34:20,588
Don't worry.

690
00:34:20,631 --> 00:34:23,730
Everything's going to be okay.

691
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:54,709
You know, my boy, I should be
very angry with you.

692
00:34:54,747 --> 00:34:56,239
Are you?

693
00:34:56,285 --> 00:34:58,085
Ah, not in the slightest.

694
00:34:58,123 --> 00:34:59,387
I can't help myself.

695
00:34:59,427 --> 00:35:01,022
I like you!

696
00:35:02,435 --> 00:35:04,406
Now, where have you taken me?

697
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,810
Into the wormhole.

698
00:35:08,684 --> 00:35:10,314
What's going on?

699
00:35:10,355 --> 00:35:12,349
Huh. This is
exactly what happened

700
00:35:12,393 --> 00:35:14,159
the last time I was in here.

701
00:35:14,198 --> 00:35:16,727
The wormhole aliens
are delightful people

702
00:35:16,771 --> 00:35:19,266
but they like their privacy.

703
00:35:19,311 --> 00:35:21,179
So you did meet them.

704
00:35:21,217 --> 00:35:23,451
How did you make contact?

705
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:26,622
Well, I see you've brought
the Orb of Wisdom with you.

706
00:35:26,664 --> 00:35:28,294
That should do the trick.

707
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:31,366
Now, if you really want
to get their attention

708
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:33,040
open the box.

709
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,416
That's what I did.

710
00:35:35,453 --> 00:35:37,219
Sounds simple enough.

711
00:35:38,461 --> 00:35:40,523
You better hurry.

712
00:35:40,566 --> 00:35:43,404
I got the dampening field
on this ship

713
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:45,537
for a substantial discount.

714
00:36:06,668 --> 00:36:08,434
Hello?

715
00:36:11,681 --> 00:36:14,849
Hello?
Is anyone there?

716
00:36:14,889 --> 00:36:16,860
It is corporeal.

717
00:36:16,961 --> 00:36:19,399
Doctor, what are you
doing in here?

718
00:36:20,738 --> 00:36:23,472
A physical entity.

719
00:36:23,511 --> 00:36:25,813
Not another one.

720
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:26,842
I get it.

721
00:36:26,886 --> 00:36:28,686
You're the wormhole aliens.

722
00:36:28,725 --> 00:36:31,597
Or would you rather be
called the Prophets?

723
00:36:31,632 --> 00:36:33,866
I never could figure
that one out.

724
00:36:33,905 --> 00:36:35,397
Did the Sisko send you?

725
00:36:35,442 --> 00:36:37,072
What?

726
00:36:37,114 --> 00:36:39,085
Sisko?

727
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,887
What does he have to do
with anything?

728
00:36:46,505 --> 00:36:49,911
The Sisko taught us
about corporeal life-forms.

729
00:36:49,946 --> 00:36:52,076
About linguistic communication.

730
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:53,554
And linear time.

731
00:36:53,589 --> 00:36:54,558
I know all about it.

732
00:36:54,592 --> 00:36:55,561
He's quite a guy

733
00:36:55,594 --> 00:36:56,824
but I'm not here
to talk about Sisko.

734
00:36:56,864 --> 00:36:59,098
Then why are you here?

735
00:36:59,137 --> 00:37:02,475
I'm here to talk
about the Nagus.

736
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:03,538
The Nagus?

737
00:37:03,582 --> 00:37:06,077
The other Ferengi
who visited you.

738
00:37:06,122 --> 00:37:08,286
The one who brought the Orb.

739
00:37:08,328 --> 00:37:10,458
We are aware of the Zek.

740
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,494
He came to see you
to ask for help.

741
00:37:12,538 --> 00:37:14,600
He wanted to learn
about the future.

742
00:37:14,644 --> 00:37:17,242
The Zek wanted to know
the outcome of the game

743
00:37:17,284 --> 00:37:18,514
before it was played.

744
00:37:18,554 --> 00:37:20,422
That's right.

745
00:37:20,459 --> 00:37:22,157
So what went wrong?

746
00:37:22,197 --> 00:37:25,969
At first, we did not understand
the Zek's request.

747
00:37:26,074 --> 00:37:29,378
The Sisko said
that corporeal beings

748
00:37:29,415 --> 00:37:31,979
value their linear existence.

749
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:34,084
The Zek wanted
to understand events

750
00:37:34,128 --> 00:37:36,464
outside the restrictions
of linear time.

751
00:37:36,501 --> 00:37:38,233
He wanted to see the future

752
00:37:38,272 --> 00:37:39,764
so he could gain by it.

753
00:37:39,809 --> 00:37:42,509
Yes, the Zek explained
the value of gain...

754
00:37:42,549 --> 00:37:45,021
how more is preferable to less.

755
00:37:45,056 --> 00:37:46,525
He taught you about profit.

756
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,190
We found the concept...

757
00:37:48,231 --> 00:37:49,222
aggressive.

758
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,327
Adversarial.

759
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:51,965
Dangerous.

760
00:37:52,007 --> 00:37:55,209
We could not comprehend
how any species could lead

761
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:56,742
such a barren existence.

762
00:37:56,787 --> 00:37:58,222
It has its advantages.

763
00:37:58,257 --> 00:37:59,590
We don't agree.

764
00:37:59,628 --> 00:38:04,835
We found the Zek's adversarial
nature invasive, threatening.

765
00:38:04,874 --> 00:38:07,142
We examined
your species' history.

766
00:38:07,181 --> 00:38:09,311
The totality of your existence.

767
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:13,125
We discovered that you have not
always been as you are now.

768
00:38:13,162 --> 00:38:14,131
We haven't?

769
00:38:14,165 --> 00:38:15,965
There was a time

770
00:38:16,004 --> 00:38:18,704
when your people's
acquiring nature

771
00:38:18,744 --> 00:38:20,510
was not so pronounced.

772
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,782
Wait a second.

773
00:38:22,821 --> 00:38:27,026
Are you telling me that you
somehow de-evolved the Nagus?

774
00:38:27,065 --> 00:38:29,697
We have restored
the Zek to an earlier

775
00:38:29,739 --> 00:38:32,268
less adversarial
state of existence.

776
00:38:32,312 --> 00:38:34,648
You can't do that.

777
00:38:34,685 --> 00:38:39,926
The Nagus is the financial
leader of billions of Ferengi.

778
00:38:39,965 --> 00:38:44,032
I demand that you re-evolve
him immediately.

779
00:38:44,077 --> 00:38:46,572
This one is adversarial, too.

780
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:47,778
Aggressive.

781
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,984
Intrusive.

782
00:38:50,025 --> 00:38:52,554
We should do to this one
what we did with the other:

783
00:38:52,598 --> 00:38:54,934
Restore it
to a purer existence.

784
00:38:54,971 --> 00:38:57,705
Counteract its
adversarial nature.

785
00:38:57,744 --> 00:38:59,943
Wait, let's not be hasty.

786
00:38:59,984 --> 00:39:02,890
There's nothing wrong
with acquiring profit.

787
00:39:02,925 --> 00:39:04,725
That is what the Zek said.

788
00:39:04,763 --> 00:39:05,732
And he was right.

789
00:39:05,765 --> 00:39:07,827
Look, I don't know
how you people live

790
00:39:07,872 --> 00:39:10,276
but all of us corporeal,
linear whatevers

791
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:11,779
have certain things in common.

792
00:39:11,815 --> 00:39:14,117
And one of those things is...

793
00:39:14,221 --> 00:39:17,924
the need to improve ourselves.

794
00:39:17,964 --> 00:39:20,026
Our ambition
to improve ourselves

795
00:39:20,069 --> 00:39:22,405
motivates everything we do.

796
00:39:22,442 --> 00:39:27,410
Without ambition, without...
dare I say it? ...greed

797
00:39:27,455 --> 00:39:30,053
people would lie around
all day doing nothing.

798
00:39:30,095 --> 00:39:33,935
They wouldn't work.

799
00:39:33,972 --> 00:39:36,068
They wouldn't bathe.

800
00:39:36,111 --> 00:39:38,709
They wouldn't even eat.

801
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,186
They'd starve to death.

802
00:39:40,222 --> 00:39:41,954
Is that what you want?

803
00:39:41,993 --> 00:39:44,933
Are you so isolated
and detached

804
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:48,876
that you would sit back
and allow the extinction

805
00:39:48,911 --> 00:39:51,509
of every corporeal being
in the galaxy?

806
00:39:51,551 --> 00:39:53,785
Your argument is specious.

807
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:56,388
Changing you will not result
in the termination

808
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:57,956
of all corporeal existence.

809
00:39:58,002 --> 00:39:59,471
All right.

810
00:39:59,505 --> 00:40:02,103
So maybe I exaggerated a little.

811
00:40:02,145 --> 00:40:03,239
We should alter this one

812
00:40:03,348 --> 00:40:05,046
and return it
to its own species.

813
00:40:05,086 --> 00:40:06,989
Agreed.

814
00:40:07,025 --> 00:40:09,691
It is best to avoid contact
with this species.

815
00:40:09,731 --> 00:40:11,599
Wait. If you don't want
to have any more contact

816
00:40:11,636 --> 00:40:13,128
with the Ferengi,
that's fine with me

817
00:40:13,174 --> 00:40:17,277
but by altering me,
you won't be avoiding contact

818
00:40:17,352 --> 00:40:20,086
you'll be encouraging it.

819
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:23,931
My people are very inquisitive,
and if you change me

820
00:40:23,968 --> 00:40:25,939
they're going to want to know
what happened

821
00:40:25,973 --> 00:40:27,910
and they're going
to come here to find out

822
00:40:27,946 --> 00:40:30,920
just as I came to find out
what happened to Zek.

823
00:40:30,953 --> 00:40:32,320
That is linear.

824
00:40:32,424 --> 00:40:35,022
And potentially
very annoying to you.

825
00:40:35,064 --> 00:40:38,528
But, on the other hand,
if you leave me alone

826
00:40:38,573 --> 00:40:41,672
and you put the Nagus back
the way he was when you met him

827
00:40:41,715 --> 00:40:45,452
I guarantee you,
you'll never have to talk

828
00:40:45,492 --> 00:40:47,964
with another Ferengi again.

829
00:40:47,998 --> 00:40:50,232
So what do you say?

830
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:53,472
Linguistic communication
is tiresome.

831
00:40:53,512 --> 00:40:55,506
My point exactly.

832
00:40:55,551 --> 00:40:57,681
Which is why I think
you should send me ba...

833
00:40:59,494 --> 00:41:00,793
Quark.

834
00:41:02,067 --> 00:41:03,093
Quark!

835
00:41:03,137 --> 00:41:04,538
Quark...

836
00:41:04,574 --> 00:41:05,975
are you all right?

837
00:41:07,147 --> 00:41:08,309
I think so.

838
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:09,980
What about you?

839
00:41:10,022 --> 00:41:13,087
Oh, stop toadying up to me,
Quark, it's revolting.

840
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:14,656
Just get me out of here.

841
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,195
I have an Orb to sell
to the Bajorans.

842
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,974
Did you say "sell"?

843
00:41:20,014 --> 00:41:22,384
I'm going to make them pay
through the nose.

844
00:41:24,459 --> 00:41:27,923
Speaking of nose,
where is my beetle snuff?

845
00:41:27,968 --> 00:41:30,030
Oh, Nagus, you're back.

846
00:41:30,074 --> 00:41:31,543
I'm so happy.

847
00:41:31,577 --> 00:41:34,345
You're wrinkling my suit.

848
00:41:34,385 --> 00:41:37,621
Whatever you say.

849
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:48,018
And now, it is with great pride
that I present the nominees

850
00:41:48,053 --> 00:41:49,626
for this year's
Carrington Award.

851
00:41:49,759 --> 00:41:55,833
They are Dr. April Wade,
Senva of Vulcan

852
00:41:55,875 --> 00:42:00,182
Dr. Henri Roget,
Chirurgeon Ghee P'Trell

853
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,815
and Dr. Julian Bashir.

854
00:42:01,858 --> 00:42:03,658
Good luck.

855
00:42:06,168 --> 00:42:07,763
The winner is...

856
00:42:07,806 --> 00:42:09,674
Doctor...

857
00:42:09,711 --> 00:42:11,579
Henri Roget.

858
00:42:13,454 --> 00:42:14,787
Roget.

859
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:16,988
How could they give it to Roget?

860
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:19,332
Better luck next time.

861
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,138
Maybe... in 40 or 50 years.

862
00:42:23,146 --> 00:42:24,274
Julian.

863
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:28,457
Sorry.

864
00:42:31,835 --> 00:42:34,205
You seem to be
handling this well.

865
00:42:34,241 --> 00:42:35,973
Believe me...

866
00:42:37,182 --> 00:42:39,050
I'm not.

867
00:42:39,087 --> 00:42:40,647
I didn't think so.

868
00:42:43,732 --> 00:42:45,896
Now, remember
what I said, Quark.

869
00:42:45,939 --> 00:42:49,506
If anyone asks, you have
no idea what happened

870
00:42:49,548 --> 00:42:51,212
to the charity money.

871
00:42:51,252 --> 00:42:52,882
You can count on me.

872
00:42:52,923 --> 00:42:56,329
And you're sure you've
destroyed every last copy

873
00:42:56,366 --> 00:42:58,930
of <i>The Revised Rules</i>
<i>of Acquisition?</i>

874
00:42:59,006 --> 00:43:02,709
The only place the new Rules
exist is inside my head.

875
00:43:02,749 --> 00:43:04,013
Eh?

876
00:43:04,052 --> 00:43:05,021
Uh...

877
00:43:05,054 --> 00:43:06,888
don't worry.

878
00:43:06,926 --> 00:43:08,156
Within a week

879
00:43:08,196 --> 00:43:09,563
he'll have forgotten them all.

880
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,591
He'd better.

881
00:43:23,201 --> 00:43:24,500
I don't believe it, Brother.

882
00:43:24,539 --> 00:43:27,911
After all you did for the Nagus,
he never even thanked you.

883
00:43:27,947 --> 00:43:31,650
He doesn't have to thank me...
he's the Nagus.

884
00:43:31,691 --> 00:43:33,787
There's only one thing
that bothers me.

885
00:43:33,829 --> 00:43:34,855
Don't get me wrong.

886
00:43:34,899 --> 00:43:36,631
I was honored
to help the Nagus.

887
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:38,607
But it would have been
nice if I'd been able

888
00:43:38,642 --> 00:43:40,636
to make a little profit
for all my troubles.

889
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,310
That's all right.

890
00:43:42,351 --> 00:43:43,981
I made enough profit
for the both of us.

891
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:45,252
What are you talking about?

892
00:43:45,293 --> 00:43:48,996
I'm talking about the Ferengi
Benevolent Association.

893
00:43:49,103 --> 00:43:52,009
Did you know it was funded
with Zek's personal fortune?

894
00:43:52,077 --> 00:43:56,316
I was the Senior
Administrator, Brother.

895
00:43:56,354 --> 00:43:57,755
You embezzled money?

896
00:43:57,792 --> 00:43:58,920
From the Nagus?

897
00:44:00,232 --> 00:44:02,169
Surprise.

898
00:44:02,203 --> 00:44:06,168
Father would be proud.
