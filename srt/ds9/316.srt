1
00:00:01,168 --> 00:00:04,171
(<i> moaning</i> )

2
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:05,714
WOMAN:
Am I doing
it right?

3
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:08,049
You don't have to be
quite so gentle.

4
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:09,802
(<i> sighing</i> )

5
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:11,887
Tell me again.

6
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:13,889
Tell you about what?

7
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,808
About the stem bolts.

8
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:22,690
I have 100 gross of
self-sealing stem bolts

9
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,360
sitting in Cargo Bay 11.

10
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,111
And they're all mine?

11
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:31,490
For only ten bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

12
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,660
Quark, you don't know
how much this means to me.

13
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,871
You don't know how much
this means to<i> me.</i>

14
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:39,414
With those stem bolts
my family will be able
to triple production

15
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,333
of our reverse-ratcheting
routing planers.

16
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,335
Glad to be of help.

17
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:48,089
Oh, Quark, I can't wait
any longer.

18
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:53,637
Why don't you and I go down
to Cargo Bay 11 and...

19
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:55,973
sign the contract?

20
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,140
(<i> both laugh</i> )

21
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,059
No need to rush.

22
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,729
Your family's ship won't
be here for a week.

23
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:03,814
We'll have plenty of time

24
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:08,235
to finalize the deal
before then.

25
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:11,488
That's an unusual attitude
for a Ferengi.

26
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:16,201
I'm a very unusual Ferengi.

27
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,912
(<i> door chimes</i> )

28
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:20,873
That must be the Saurian brandy
I ordered.

29
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:22,249
Enter.

30
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:26,587
QUARK:
Rom, where's
my brandy?

31
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:27,963
Forget the brandy, Brother.

32
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:29,548
You must leave
here immediately.

33
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:31,466
And that goes
for the female as well.

34
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,385
Is something wrong?

35
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:34,845
There's nothing wrong.

36
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:39,058
Have you lost your mind?

37
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:41,727
She's willing, she's wealthy

38
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:43,938
and she wants to buy
our stem bolts.

39
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:46,690
It's going to have to wait.
Something important
has come up.

40
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,735
Right now, nothing is more
important than this.

41
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,278
(<i> thump</i> )

42
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,656
Grand Nagus Zek.

43
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,742
As big as life.

44
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,621
Go, go!

45
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:14,342
What does Zek
want with me?

46
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:16,804
Looks like he's moving
in with you, Brother.

47
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:18,138
Oh....

48
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,971
Sisko to Bashir.

49
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,848
This is Bashir.

50
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:27,267
Doctor, please report
to the Wardroom immediately.

51
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,353
On my way.

52
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:35,567
(<i> people cheering</i> )

53
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,946
What's this?

54
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,281
Champagne.

55
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,366
SISKO:
Congratulations, Doctor.

56
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,077
Well, thank you.

57
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:47,454
Now, will someone
please tell me
what's going on?

58
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,289
The Federation Medical
Council has announced

59
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,666
the nominees for this year's
Carrington Award.

60
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,418
And the nominees are...

61
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,171
Dr. April Wade of the
University of Nairobi,

62
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,215
Healer Senva of the
Vulcan Medical Institute,

63
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:02,803
Dr. Henri Roget of
the Central Hospital
of Altair IV,

64
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,847
Chirurgeon Ghee
P'Trell of Andoria

65
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:09,893
and Dr. Julian Bashir,
Chief Medical Officer

66
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,812
of Starbase Deep Space 9.

67
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,022
(<i> all cheer</i> )

68
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,233
Good luck.
There must be some mistake.

69
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,652
As far as I know,
my name wasn't even
up for consideration.

70
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,737
Oh, it was up for
consideration.

71
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,615
I submitted it myself
through an old friend
of Curzon's.

72
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:25,742
You deserve the nomination,
Doctor.

73
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,078
Your work
on biomolecular replication

74
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:31,665
was both audacious
and groundbreaking.

75
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,500
According to Dax, anyway.

76
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,128
She's the only one
who understands it.

77
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:37,754
So how does it
feel to be

78
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,006
the youngest nominee
in the history

79
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,007
of the Carrington Award?

80
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,383
It feels... good.

81
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,014
Excuse me.

82
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,183
I've got to finish some work.

83
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:03,238
What exactly is it
you want me to say?

84
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:06,365
I want you to say that you
are thrilled beyond belief
to be nominated

85
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:09,036
for the Federation's most
prestigious medical award.

86
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:11,621
Well, believe me,
I'm honored to have
been nominated.

87
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,123
Well, you're not
acting like it.

88
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,624
It's just that I
don't want everyone

89
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,293
to make a big
deal out of it.

90
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,045
It<i> is</i> a big deal.

91
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:20,505
We're all proud of you.
I'm glad,

92
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:23,175
but before you agonize
over the next few days
over the board's decision,

93
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:25,468
I want to assure you that
I'm not going to win.

94
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:29,097
You don't know that.
The work you've been doing
deserves to be recognized.

95
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,849
But this isn't about my work.

96
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,642
Do you know what the
average life expectancy

97
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,936
of a Carrington Award
winner is? Five years.

98
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,105
Ten at the very best--
and do you know why?

99
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,691
Because the Carrington
Award is intended to be

100
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:42,401
the crowning achievement
for a lifetime in medicine.

101
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,112
April Wade is 106.

102
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,739
The last time
she was nominated,
three years ago,

103
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,490
people said
it was premature.

104
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,576
You're exaggerating.

105
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,703
Maybe... a little.

106
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,914
But the undeniable truth
is I am way too young

107
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,999
to be a serious contender
for the Carrington.

108
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,835
Now, put my name up for
nomination in 70 years

109
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:02,256
and I promise you,
I will get very excited.

110
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:04,758
But until then, I don't plan
on giving it much thought.

111
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,634
That's a very
mature attitude.

112
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,387
You sound surprised.

113
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:11,098
I'm actually astonished,
but impressed.

114
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,474
So then we don't
have to dwell on it
for the next three days?

115
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,768
I won't
mention it again.

116
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,519
I appreciate that, Jadzia.

117
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,646
So who do you think's going
to win-- Wade or P'Trell?

118
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:19,773
(<i> exasperated sigh</i> )

119
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:30,784
A cup of millipede juice,
hold the shells.

120
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,046
Rom!

121
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:53,098
Rom! Rom!

122
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,478
Did you call me, Brother?
Would it be too much trouble

123
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,189
for you to put
these empty bottles
in the replicator?

124
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,317
Keeping my quarter's clean
is Nog's job.

125
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:06,486
Except Nog is on the homeworld
visiting his grandmother.

126
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,530
Then cleaning
will just have to wait
until he gets back.

127
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:13,368
No, it won't!
Until the Nagus gives me
back my own quarters,

128
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:16,997
this is my home, too,
and I have had enough
of this mess.

129
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,582
Clean it up now.
I won't.

130
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,168
Yes, you will.

131
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,337
It's bad enough
I've had to put up

132
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:26,173
with your constant
teeth-grinding every night

133
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:28,633
and your incessant
ear-picking,

134
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,261
but I will not tolerate
living like some...

135
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,972
some Pakled refuse
merchant for another...

136
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:36,433
Wait a minute.

137
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,977
This is a bottle
of Aldebaran whiskey.

138
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,396
Let me, Brother.
I recognize this label.

139
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,106
This is from
my private stock.

140
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:46,485
No, it's not.
It most certainly is.

141
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:48,236
Wait a minute.

142
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:51,948
What's that over there, hmm?

143
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,658
Trixian bubble juice?

144
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,369
Nog's favorite.

145
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,415
This came from my
stockroom, didn't it?

146
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,876
Are you accusing my son
of being a thief?

147
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:08,507
No. I'm accusing<i> you</i>
of being a thief.

148
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:10,175
These table linens...

149
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,344
this chair...
that table--

150
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:15,763
everything in here
comes from my bar.

151
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,098
Not everything.

152
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,892
When you're done
cleaning up,

153
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,978
I'm going to conduct
a complete inventory

154
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:26,983
and find out exactly what
you've stolen from me.

155
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,318
Now, get to work.

156
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,904
No. I refuse.

157
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,950
I work for you all day, Brother,
but here, I'm the boss.

158
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,037
If you want this place
cleaned up, do it yourself.

159
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,956
What I want is
my own quarters back.

160
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,583
That makes two of us.

161
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:49,005
Living with you
was bad enough
when we were children.

162
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,590
What do I do?

163
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,301
You...<i> think.</i>
What do you mean, I "think"?

164
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:56,346
You stay up late every night
plotting and scheming.

165
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,432
And when you think,
you mumble.

166
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:00,058
And if there's anything
I can't stand,

167
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:01,976
it's listening
to you mumble.

168
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,853
That does it.

169
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,856
I have been accommodating
long enough.

170
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,649
If the Nagus wants
to stay on the station,

171
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:13,071
he's going to have to find
someplace else to live.

172
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,705
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

173
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,665
No one's seen the Nagus
since he got here.

174
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,626
He must be working
on something important.

175
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,669
If you disturb him,
he might get very angry.

176
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,547
I'm not going
to disturb him.

177
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:31,672
You are.

178
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,049
Me? Why not you?

179
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,593
Zek likes me,

180
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:36,761
so I can't afford
to get on his bad side.

181
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:40,390
On the other hand,
he barely acknowledges
your existence.

182
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,767
So, you have
nothing to lose.

183
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,895
Now, get in there
and tell the Nagus
he'll have to leave.

184
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,772
And whatever happens,

185
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:51,318
don't let Maihar'du
intimidate you, hmm?

186
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,320
Where are you going?

187
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,697
Don't worry. If you need me,
I'll be close by.

188
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,076
Rom!

189
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,412
What can I do
for you, my boy?

190
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:05,706
Grand Nagus, forgive me
for disturbing you.

191
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:10,420
Who's disturbed?
I've been hoping
someone would drop by.

192
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,921
Now, come right in.

193
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:15,425
Why, thank you.
We'd be delighted.

194
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:22,223
Quark, I knew you'd be
lurking around here someplace.

195
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,891
(<i> both laugh</i> )

196
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,227
Well, what are we
standing out here for?

197
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:31,608
I've got something
very exciting
to show you both.

198
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,818
What happened
to my furniture?

199
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:37,614
I got rid of it.
It was getting in the way
of my work.

200
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,907
And what work was
that, Grand Nagus?

201
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,160
If I may be so bold?

202
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,912
I'm glad you asked.

203
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,414
Maihar'du!

204
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,708
The book.

205
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:58,134
You are about to read the
shining triumph of my life,

206
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:02,681
the one thing I'll
always be remembered for.

207
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:04,474
May I?

208
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,809
By all means.

209
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,815
<i>"The Rules</i>
<i>of Acquisition,</i>

210
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,193
<i>revised for the</i>
<i>modern Ferengi."</i>

211
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:18,112
You rewrote the Rules
of Acquisition?

212
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,114
I hope you like them.

213
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,116
Absorb...

214
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,327
enjoy.

215
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:27,455
Rom, do you know
what this means?

216
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:31,042
Yes, it means we're going
to have to memorize
a whole new set of Rules.

217
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,627
No, you idiot.

218
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,338
It means we'll be
the first Ferengi

219
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,424
to benefit
from Zek's wisdom.

220
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,926
The knowledge
contained in this book

221
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:43,680
could make us both rich
beyond our wildest dreams.

222
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,683
I'll be able to go into
business for myself?
Mm-hmm.

223
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,143
Turn the page, Brother,
turn the page.

224
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,354
The First Rule of
Acquisition is...

225
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:52,897
Go on.

226
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,566
"If they want
their money back...

227
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,359
Yes, yes.
...give it to them."

228
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,945
"If they want
their money back...

229
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,739
give it to them"?

230
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:08,121
(<i> sniffling and sobbing</i> )

231
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:23,177
"Rule Number 21: Never place
profit before friendship."

232
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,596
(<i> groans</i> )

233
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:28,182
"Rule Number 22:
Latinum tarnishes

234
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,685
but family is forever."

235
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,019
(<i> hisses</i> )

236
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,188
"Rule 23:

00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:37,651
Money can never
replace dignity."

238
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,360
Oh, skip to the end!

239
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,239
Well, what is it?

240
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,032
Oh, you're not going
to like it, Brother.

241
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,034
I can take it.
Tell me.

242
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,704
"Rule Number 285:

243
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:53,207
"A good deed

244
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,917
(<i> gasping</i> )

245
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:59,130
Brother, are you all right?

246
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,883
I... I... I just
have to sit down.

247
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:07,555
No, take it away!

248
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:08,682
Sorry.

249
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,183
Got to think.

250
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,559
Got to think.

251
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,019
There has to be
some explanation

252
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,771
or reason
for why he's doing this.

253
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,190
Maybe we should ask him.

254
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,025
No. Don't you see?

255
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,401
He's testing us.

256
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,362
Yes, that must be it.

257
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,197
It's some kind of test.

258
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,324
The book. The book.

259
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:27,826
You want to hear more?

260
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:30,203
No, but it must be
some kind of code.

261
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,997
Read me the first word
of every Rule.

262
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:40,213
"If... never... keep...

263
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,341
"profit... a...

264
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:47,637
good... smile...
honesty."

265
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:54,435
Enough! If never keep profit,
a good smile, honesty.

266
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,437
What does it mean,
Brother?

267
00:14:56,437 --> 00:15:01,568
It means
absolutely nothing.

268
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,154
Maybe if we hold
the pages

269
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,614
up to the light.

270
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,826
No, no. Uh...

271
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,913
(<i> sniffing</i> )

272
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,416
Ooh!

273
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,460
Ahh! Ahh!

274
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,549
Mmm... mmm...

275
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,217
No, that's not it.

276
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:29,929
The answer must be
right in front of us.

277
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,015
I know! Maybe the Nagus
has gone insane.

278
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,518
Nonsense, the Nagus is the
most brilliant Ferengi alive.

279
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,478
I've modeled my life
after him.

280
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,899
Don't ever let me
hear you speak that way
about him again.

281
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:42,983
But what if he really
believes all this?

282
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:45,194
How can he believe
this insanity?

283
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,321
No, it has to be
part of some

284
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,742
brilliant, twisted,
devious plan.

285
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:53,620
The Nagus isn't
like you and me, Rom.

286
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:57,957
He thinks ten,
sometimes 20 steps ahead.

287
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:01,335
These Rules are
probably the key component

288
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:04,297
in some vast plot to seize
financial control

289
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,382
of the entire
Quadrant.

290
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,842
So what do we do?

291
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:12,847
The only thing
we can do.

292
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:16,183
We put down this book...

293
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:21,815
and we walk away.

294
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:23,566
And when the Nagus
feels ready,

295
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,109
he'll inform us
of his plans.

296
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,903
But until then,
we have to act

297
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,863
as if we
know nothing.

298
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:30,531
I can do that.

299
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:43,795
If never keep profit,
a good smile, honesty.

300
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:44,963
Nah.

301
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:46,673
ZEK:
Quark, my boy!

302
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:49,133
What say we buy
everyone a drink?

303
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,844
Put it on my tab.

304
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,096
But why?

305
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,849
Because it will make
everyone happy.

306
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:58,518
And that will
make<i> me</i> happy.

307
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,603
It must all be
part of his plan.

308
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:02,480
Wheels within wheels,
Brother.

309
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,816
Drinks
for everyone.

310
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:07,443
Compliments of
the Grand Nagus.

311
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,529
(<i> cheering</i> )

312
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,198
Is there anything else
I can get you, Nagus?

313
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,783
We just got in
a shipment

314
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,618
of quality Hupyrian
beetle snuff.

315
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:19,664
Actually, I've lost my taste
for beetle snuff.

316
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:26,086
It might be fun for you and me,
but it's no fun for the beetles.

317
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:28,130
Oh, and by the way, Quark,

318
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,300
I just met the most lovely
young female.

319
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,594
She came by your quarters
looking for you.

320
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,137
Was her name Emi,
by any chance?

321
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,973
She wanted me to tell you

322
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:40,601
that her family's ship
has arrived with the latinum.

323
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,896
Aha! It's about time!

324
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,689
Rom, watch the bar.

325
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:47,025
We're finally going to get
rid of those stem bolts.

326
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:49,318
I don't think so.
But we have a contract.

327
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,487
Which was never signed.

328
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,865
And frankly, Quark,

329
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:58,202
you were charging an outrageous
price for those stem bolts.

330
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,162
She didn't seem to think so.

331
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,415
Well, she did
once I explained it to her.

332
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,584
You what?
Well, I couldn't allow you

333
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:08,880
to take advantage of
an innocent young female
like that, Quark.

334
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,966
So I told her where she could
get all the stem bolts

335
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:14,552
she needed... at wholesale.

336
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,971
(<i> gasping</i> )

337
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:19,181
Wholesale?

338
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:23,686
He told her
where to get them
at wholesale.

339
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,856
What am I
going to do

340
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,733
with a hundred gross
of stem bolts?

341
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,570
My poor brother.

342
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,405
Oh, don't worry
about him.

343
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:37,241
Eventually, he'll sell
those stem bolts...

344
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,452
at a fair price.

345
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:40,787
A fair price?

346
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,705
Ah, I'm very confused.

347
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:45,332
That's
understandable.

348
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:49,336
It'll take some time to
get used to the new ways.

349
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,171
New ways...

350
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,257
Walk with me, Rom.

351
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,231
Your turn.

352
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,069
Ah, I don't know about this.

353
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,154
Would you rather play
a game of racquetball?

354
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,948
Chief, since Keiko's
been on Bajor,

355
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:19,325
we've played 106 games
of racquetball.

356
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,327
Right. So throw a dart.

357
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,456
I'm a bit rusty.

358
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,291
So am I.

359
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,044
I guess
the smart money's
on Wade or P'Trell.

360
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:35,341
That seems to be
the general consensus.

361
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:39,386
I mean... Doctor Wade
is very popular,

362
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,889
but P'Trell is doing
some amazing work

363
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,017
in gerontological research.

364
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,977
Which one do you
think will win?

365
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:48,980
Either of them would be a worthy
recipient of the Carrington.

366
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,107
Oh. Of course,
if I had my druthers,

367
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:52,900
the award
would go to you.

368
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:56,612
Thank you.

369
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,990
But let's face it.

370
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,616
You don't stand a chance.

371
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,286
You don't say.

372
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,081
I mean,<i> I</i> know
you're talented...

373
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:11,044
but I bet there's
doctors all over
the Federation

374
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:13,796
saying, "Julian Bashir,
who the hell is he?"

375
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:20,011
Chief, you are
absolutely right.

376
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,057
I'm glad you agree.

377
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,226
So...

378
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,978
how much longer
is Keiko

379
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,270
going to be
on Bajor?

380
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:42,533
Make sure the relief
shipment is sent
by high-warp courier.

381
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:45,452
And don't worry
about the cost.

382
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,871
(<i> sharp sigh</i> )

383
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,789
Rom, what's all this?

384
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:52,085
You're looking at
the Sector Headquarters

385
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:55,088
for the Ferengi
Benevolent Association.

386
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:10,394
Brother, I don't have
time to talk to you.
I have work to do.

387
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:14,899
I'm the new Senior
Administrator of the Ferengi
Benevolent Association.

388
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,776
You know, Brother,
I never realized how
many people there are

389
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,318
that could
use a little help.

390
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,029
If you don't get
down to the bar right now,

391
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,864
you're the one going
to need a little help.

392
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,117
The Nagus said
you'd react like this.

393
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:25,910
The Nagus is a smart man.

394
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,912
Oh, he's more than that.
He's a visionary.

395
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:30,539
He has plans, Brother.
And I'm going to be
a part of them.

396
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,084
What would the Nagus
possibly want with you?

397
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:36,003
Oh, he says I'm malleable.

398
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,838
And that he's
going to mold me

399
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,381
into a new kind
of Ferengi--

400
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,050
an evolved Ferengi.

401
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,676
"Evolved"? Into what?

402
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,511
I'm not sure, exactly.

403
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,430
But the Nagus says
that the answers lie

404
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,015
in his new Rules
of Acquisition.

405
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,517
He told me, "Rom,
it's time for the Ferengi

406
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:51,894
to move beyond greed."

407
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:53,271
Beyond greed?!

408
00:21:53,271 --> 00:21:55,231
There's nothing
beyond greed.

409
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:58,317
Greed is the purest,
most noble of emotions.

410
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,861
Greed is dead.
That's the Tenth
Rule of Acquisition.

411
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:04,615
No, it's not. The Tenth
Rule of Acquisition is
"greed is eternal."

412
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:07,743
Not anymore.
The Nagus is going to shake

413
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,454
the very foundation
of Ferengi society.

414
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:13,373
And we're going
to be at his side
every step of the way.

415
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:15,626
What do you mean, "we"?

416
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:18,712
The Nagus has made you
cochairman of the
Benevolent Association.

417
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:22,216
Your name will
figure prominently
on all our correspondence.

418
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:24,635
He never mentioned
anything about that to me.

419
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:27,013
The Nagus wouldn't dream
of excluding you, Brother.

420
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:29,473
As soon as we get
the Benevolent Association
established here,

421
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,976
the Nagus plans on returning
to the homeworld,

422
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:34,145
and we'll go with him.
Think of it.

423
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:37,773
You and I will be there
when Zek personally announces

424
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,859
the new Rules
of Acquisition

425
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:43,196
on the Grand Steps
of the Sacred Marketplace.

426
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:44,989
We'll be there,
all right.

427
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:47,407
And we'll probably be
right alongside of him

428
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,118
when they throw him
from the Spire

429
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:50,494
of the Tower of Commerce.

430
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:53,039
The Tower
of Commerce?

431
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,125
But... that's the
tallest building
in the Ferengi Alliance.

432
00:22:56,125 --> 00:23:00,838
A fall from that height
could... could... could...

433
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:02,673
Exactly.

434
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,885
Don't you see, Rom?

435
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,470
There's something terribly
wrong with the Nagus.

436
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,556
And we have to help him...

437
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,892
before he gets us all killed.

438
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:18,147
That tickles!

439
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:20,066
Well, I must say,
for a Ferengi your age,

440
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:22,193
you're in
excellent health--

441
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:24,486
aside from some
vascular damage to
your mucus membranes.

442
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,322
You really should stop
using that beetle snuff.

443
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:30,910
As a matter of fact...
I already have.

444
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,995
I'm glad to hear it.

445
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,248
Does this mean you'll
have to go in for some
exploratory surgery?

446
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:37,583
Why would I do that?
To find out what's
wrong with him.

447
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,585
There's nothing
wrong with him, Quark.

448
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:42,046
That's not true.
There's something
deeply wrong with him

449
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:43,964
and you have to
find out what it is.

450
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,758
I've done every test
I can think of.

451
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:48,052
There's no trauma,
brain damage,
mental illness.

452
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:50,721
His central nervous
system's working within
normal parameters

453
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,932
and his endocrine system's
in terrific shape.

454
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,725
You see? I told you.

455
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:57,770
They're like a couple
of nervous investors,

456
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,314
always looking for trouble.

457
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:02,066
(<i> laughs</i> )

458
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:04,818
Oh, well, I suppose
I should be flattered.

459
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:08,322
Thank you, Doctor.
You've been very helpful.

460
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:09,365
No.

461
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:10,699
Uh-uh.

462
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,368
He's sick,
I tell you.

463
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:14,661
You have to perform
more tests.

464
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:16,538
Quark! If you don't
get out of here,

465
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,665
I'll perform more
tests on<i> you.</i>

466
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:20,918
(<i> giggling</i> )
You have to
do something.

467
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:23,545
Like what?
Put him in stasis,

468
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,132
keep him from hurting himself
until you can figure out
what<i> is</i> wrong with him.

469
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:27,758
I don't think
that's necessary.

470
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:29,551
I can't believe
you're supposed to be

471
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,762
one of the five best doctors
in the Federation.

472
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:33,555
If you ask me, you're a quack.

473
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,141
No wonder everyone says
you don't have a chance

474
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:36,600
to win the
Carrington.

475
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,020
Let's go.

476
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,772
Maybe we can make
an appointment

477
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:43,899
for you to see Doctor Wade.

478
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,068
BASHIR: Good luck.
If I remember correctly,

479
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:49,280
Nairobi is beautiful
this time of year.

480
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,115
Here, Doctor,
for your trouble.

481
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:52,283
I can't accept that.

482
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:54,410
Why not?
It's only money.

483
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,912
Donate it to charity
if you'd like.

484
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,082
And you say
he's not sick.

485
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,834
Oh, and, Doctor,

486
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:04,462
I do hope you'll attend
tomorrow night's ceremony.

487
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:07,465
Ceremony?
At the Bajoran Shrine
on the Promenade.

488
00:25:07,465 --> 00:25:10,508
I intend to give a gift
to the Bajoran people.

489
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:12,970
A gift.
What kind of gift?

490
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:15,097
It's a surprise.

491
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:17,933
You'll find out tomorrow night,
like everyone else.

492
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:21,020
Come along, we have a lot
of work to do before then.

493
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,022
So many needy people...

494
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:24,564
so little time.

495
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,574
Aren't you done yet?

496
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,327
Breaking into the Nagus's
personal shuttle

497
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:38,454
somehow seems
wrong, Brother.
I don't care.

498
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:40,580
I have to know what he intends
to give the Bajorans.

499
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,416
But the Nagus wants
it to be a surprise.

500
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:45,044
I hate surprises.
Now hurry it up,
before someone...

501
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,379
(<i> heavy footsteps</i> )

502
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:47,754
(<i> gasps</i> )

503
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:50,049
Maihar'du.

504
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:52,510
As you can see,
my brother and I

505
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,803
were repairing the door locks
on the Nagus's...

506
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:55,888
(<i> gasps</i> )

507
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,056
(<i> beeping</i> )

508
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:23,499
<i>This</i> is the gift?

509
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:25,334
What is it?

510
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:28,670
It's one of the missing
Bajoran Orbs, Rom.

511
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,090
An Orb of the Prophets.

512
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:39,723
I tell you, this Orb
explains everything--

513
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,475
Zek's behavior,
the new Rules

514
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:44,270
the Ferengi Benevolent
Association, everything.

515
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,687
It does? How?

516
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,232
I'm not sure, but I'm
going to find out.

517
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:51,110
Don't just stand
there-- talk to me.

518
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,153
I know how you feel.

519
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:55,906
What are you doing?

520
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:57,324
I thought we should
look inside.

521
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:58,700
I mean, we don't
know for certain

522
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,286
that there's
an Orb in here.

523
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:02,037
Maybe Zek's just
giving them the box.

524
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,539
Don't be
ridiculous.

525
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:05,707
But how will we know
unless we look?

526
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:08,877
Rom, it's too dangerous.
Leave it alone.

527
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:11,213
But, Brother!
I said leave it alone!

528
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:18,636
Rom? Maihar'du?

529
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:20,347
Morn?

530
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,391
Anybody?

531
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:24,393
ZEK:
What's the
matter, Quark?

532
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:28,272
Spinning out of control, are we?

533
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:30,065
Grand Nagus?

534
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,234
Maybe...

535
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:36,405
maybe not.

536
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,742
(<i> gasping</i> )

537
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:51,211
Looking for answers?

538
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:55,424
You couldn't find them if they
were dangling from your lobes.

539
00:27:57,343 --> 00:28:02,722
Where's that old Quark
cleverness I've heard
so much about?

540
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:06,977
Or are you
so paralyzed with fear

541
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:09,104
that you can't think straight?

542
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:12,690
Answer me, Quark.

543
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,527
What are you so nervous about?

544
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:18,780
Don't you think change
is worth dying for?

545
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:23,369
All I want
is a little leap of faith.

546
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:27,873
(<i> gasping yells</i> )

547
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:29,583
Nice catch.

548
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:34,296
That's the wonderful thing
about mysteries.

549
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:36,465
Sometimes the answers

550
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:40,093
just fall
from the sky.

551
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:42,054
What do you
have to lose?

552
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,389
Open it.

553
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,274
(<i> applause</i> )

554
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,612
Consider it a gift.

555
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:02,866
Yes. Yes.

556
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:06,620
Are you
all right?

557
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,664
A gift.
A gift?

558
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:10,499
Zek said the new Rules
were a gift.

559
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,668
A gift from Zek to
the Ferengi people.

560
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:16,088
No, a gift<i> to</i> Zek
from them.

561
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:19,550
Don't you see? They did it.
They put the idea for the
new Rules into Zek's head.

562
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,552
They changed him somehow.

563
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:24,555
They did?
How dare they?

564
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:26,473
Who are we talking
about, Brother?

565
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:29,268
The Prophets, the aliens
that live inside the wormhole.

566
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:31,478
They did this to him,
didn't they?

567
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:34,106
Tell me everything!
Easy, Brother.

568
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:37,610
You know Hupyrian servants
take a vow only to speak
to their masters.

569
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,278
You're right.
(<i> sobbing</i> )

570
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,196
Give him a handkerchief
or something.

571
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,407
I'm going to try
to break into Zek's
personal logs.

572
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:48,662
According to Zek's logs,
he obtained the Orb

573
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:51,164
from one of his contacts
on Cardassia III.

574
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:54,710
From there, he headed
straight for the wormhole.

575
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:58,338
His ship's log shows
that he entered the wormhole,

576
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,840
stayed inside
for only a few minutes,

577
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,801
then reversed course
and came here.

578
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,345
You think he went
in there to talk
to the Prophets?

579
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:08,432
In his personal logs,
Zek said...

580
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:16,440
that the future was looking
very bright indeed.

581
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:21,320
Don't you get it?
According to Dax,

582
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,656
the wormhole aliens
can see through time.

583
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:26,408
The Nagus must have thought
that he could convince them

584
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:28,327
to let him see the future.

585
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:31,204
That way,
he could anticipate

586
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,582
economic changes
throughout the galaxy.

587
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:37,210
The opportunity
for profit would
have been enormous.

588
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,464
But instead,
he created the new
Rules of Acquisition.

589
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:42,090
Why?

590
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:45,260
Something must have
gone terribly wrong.

591
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,263
But I intend
to set it right.

592
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,015
How, Brother?

593
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:51,600
I have an idea.

594
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,602
Does it
involve me?

595
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,103
Not really.

596
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:57,439
Ah. I like it.

597
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,790
May I join
you, Doctor?

598
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,916
By all means.

599
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:19,002
And what can
I do for you?

600
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,962
It's what I can
do for<i> you.</i>

601
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:24,966
I have a friend at
Starfleet Intelligence,

602
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,885
and she has a friend
who has a cousin

603
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,928
who's married
to the assistant of
one of the members

604
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:31,056
of the Federation
Medical Council.

605
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,516
Really?

606
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:34,351
And according
to my friend,

607
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:36,019
<i>her</i> friend
heard something

608
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,021
from his cousin
that his wife heard

609
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,815
from the council member

610
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:42,442
that I thought you might
find interesting.

611
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,152
Which is?

612
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:50,075
Dr. Wade is not going
to win the Carrington.

613
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:52,160
Oh, not you, too.

614
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,663
Doctor, I thought
you'd be delighted.

615
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:56,331
Even if that's true--

616
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,458
and mind you,
I'm not saying that it is--

617
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:01,169
the only one that has a reason
to celebrate is Ghee P'Trell.

618
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:05,758
Perhaps, but P'Trell is by no
means as popular as Dr. Wade.

619
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:07,509
According to your friend.

620
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:10,554
Actually, according
to my friend's friend's...

621
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:12,347
I get the picture.

622
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:15,434
The point is, if it's
not going to be Wade,

623
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:16,769
it could be anyone--

624
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:20,230
P'Trell, Senva,
Roget, even you.

625
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:23,149
I didn't think I was
going to win before,

626
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:25,527
and I don't think
I'm going to win now.

627
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:29,114
Is that a fact?
Then why have you
been working

628
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,866
on your
acceptance speech?

629
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,537
How did you know?

630
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:37,122
Just a guess.

631
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,046
(<i> sighs</i> )

632
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:56,558
ZEK:
My goodness, I never
realized solar flares

633
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:00,646
could be so devastating
to a planet's agriculture.

634
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:03,356
Now, let me see,
at current market rates,

635
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:07,360
2,000 tons of Kohlanese barley

636
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,406
would cost me a 189 bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

637
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,241
But it's worth it.

638
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,535
I can have the first
shipment of barley

639
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,871
on the way to you in the...

640
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:20,081
Hold on, I'll be right back.

641
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,208
How can I help you, boys?

642
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:33,720
(<i> Zek humming</i> )

643
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,557
Wait.

644
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,434
I have to be sure
that he's all right.

645
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,478
Grand Nagus,
can you hear me?

646
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:42,938
Are you okay?

647
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:45,899
Don't worry, Quark,
I forgive you.

648
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,609
Do you hear that?

649
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,235
We have to help him.

(<i> Zek continues humming</i> )

651
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:01,289
Brother, this is
a very brave thing
you're doing--

652
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,166
taking the Nagus back
to the wormhole.

653
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:06,169
I wish I could come
with you... but I can't.

654
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,379
Good-bye.

00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:20,517
Don't worry.
Everything's going to be okay.

(<i> humming continues</i> )

662
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:53,842
You know, my boy, I should be
very angry with you.

663
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:55,301
Are you?

664
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,095
Ah, not in the slightest.

665
00:34:57,095 --> 00:35:01,391
I can't help myself.
I like you!

666
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:03,476
Now, where have you taken me?

667
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,353
Into the wormhole.

668
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,773
(<i> gasps</i> )

669
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:09,315
What's going on?

670
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,401
Huh. This is
exactly what happened

671
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:13,070
the last time I was in here.

672
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,781
The wormhole aliens
are delightful people,

673
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:18,033
but they like
their privacy.

674
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:20,159
So you<i> did</i> meet them.

675
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:22,412
How did you make contact?

676
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:25,415
Well, I see you've brought
the Orb of Wisdom with you.

677
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:27,208
That should do the trick.

678
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:30,420
Now, if you really want
to get their attention,

679
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,338
open the box.

680
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,424
That's what I did.

681
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:36,217
Sounds simple enough.

682
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,886
(<i> yells</i> )

683
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:39,429
You better hurry.

684
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:42,390
I got the dampening field
on this ship

685
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,559
for a substantial discount.

686
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,821
(<i> heartbeat</i> )

687
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:07,415
Hello?

688
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:13,839
Hello?
Is anyone there?

689
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,757
It is corporeal.

690
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:18,384
Doctor, what are you
doing in here?

691
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:22,430
A physical entity.

692
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,432
Not another one.

693
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,809
I get it.

694
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:27,978
You're the wormhole aliens.

695
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:30,438
Or would you rather be
called the Prophets?

696
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,858
I never could figure
that one out.

697
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:34,275
Did the Sisko send you?

698
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,902
What?

699
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:38,237
Sisko?

700
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:40,782
What does he have to do
with anything?

701
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:48,832
The Sisko taught us
about corporeal life-forms.

702
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:50,959
About linguistic communication.

703
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:53,294
And linear time.
I know all about it.

704
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:55,755
He's quite a guy,
but I'm not here
to talk about Sisko.

705
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,924
Then why are you here?

706
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:01,302
I'm here to talk
about the Nagus.

707
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:05,640
The Nagus?
The other Ferengi
who visited you.

708
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,184
The one who brought the Orb.

709
00:37:07,184 --> 00:37:09,268
We are aware of the Zek.

710
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:11,312
He came to see you
to ask for help.

711
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,356
He wanted to learn
about the future.

712
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,525
The Zek wanted to know
the outcome of the game

713
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:17,360
before it was played.

714
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,945
That's right.

715
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,906
So what went wrong?

716
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:24,910
At first, we did not understand
the Zek's request.

717
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:28,205
The Sisko said
that corporeal beings

718
00:37:28,205 --> 00:37:30,790
value their
linear existence.

719
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,834
The Zek wanted
to understand events

720
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:35,294
outside the restrictions
of linear time.

721
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:37,839
He wanted to see the future
so he could gain by it.

722
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:41,259
Yes, the Zek explained
the value of gain--

723
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,678
how more is
preferable to less.

724
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,222
He taught you
about profit.

725
00:37:45,222 --> 00:37:48,225
We found the concept...
aggressive.

726
00:37:48,225 --> 00:37:50,769
Adversarial.
EMI: Dangerous.

727
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:53,230
We could not comprehend
how any species could lead

728
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,898
such a barren existence.

729
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:58,317
It has its advantages.
MAIHAR'DU: We don't agree.

730
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:03,489
We found the Zek's adversarial
nature invasive, threatening.

731
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:05,992
We examined
your species' history.

732
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,078
The totality of your existence.

733
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:11,957
We discovered that you have not
always been as you are now.

734
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:13,750
We haven't?

735
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,753
There was a time
when your people's
acquiring nature

736
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:19,256
was not so pronounced.

737
00:38:19,256 --> 00:38:21,299
Wait a second.

738
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:25,637
Are you telling me that you
somehow de-evolved the Nagus?

739
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:28,556
We have restored
the Zek to an earlier,

740
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,934
less adversarial
state of existence.

741
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:33,436
You can't do that.

742
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:38,775
The Nagus is the financial
leader of billions of Ferengi.

743
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:42,737
I demand that you re-evolve
him immediately.

744
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,364
This one is adversarial, too.

745
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:46,658
Aggressive.

746
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,785
Intrusive.

747
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:51,329
We should do to this one
what we did with the other:

748
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,706
Restore it
to a purer existence.

749
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:56,334
Counteract its
adversarial nature.

750
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,670
Wait, let's not be hasty.

751
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,673
There's nothing wrong
with acquiring profit.

752
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:04,301
That is what
the Zek said.
And he was right.

753
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:06,344
Look, I don't know
how you people live,

754
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,638
but all of us corporeal,
linear whatevers

755
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:13,392
have certain things in common.
And one of those things is...

756
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:16,437
the need to improve ourselves.

757
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,940
Our ambition
to improve ourselves

758
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,151
motivates everything we do.

759
00:39:21,151 --> 00:39:26,114
Without ambition, without--
dare I say it?-- greed

760
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:28,908
people would lie around
all day doing nothing.

761
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,745
They wouldn't work.

762
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,956
They wouldn't bathe.

763
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:37,000
They wouldn't even eat.

764
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,584
They'd starve to death.

765
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:40,461
Is that what you want?

766
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:43,756
Are you so isolated
and detached

767
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:47,302
that you would sit back
and allow the extinction

768
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:50,096
of every corporeal being
in the galaxy?

769
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,515
Your argument is specious.

770
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,642
Changing you will not result
in the termination

771
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,561
of all corporeal existence.

772
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:58,104
All right.

773
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,357
So maybe I exaggerated
a little.

774
00:40:00,357 --> 00:40:03,526
We should alter this one
and return it to
its own species.

775
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:07,446
Agreed. it is best to avoid
contact with this species.

776
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:09,657
Wait. If you don't want
to have any more contact

777
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,576
with the Ferengi,
that's fine with me,

778
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:16,039
but by altering me,
you won't be avoiding contact,

779
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:18,833
you'll be encouraging it.

780
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:22,087
My people are very inquisitive,
and if you change me,

781
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:24,089
they're going to want to know
what happened

782
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:26,632
<i>and</i> they're going
to come here to find out,

783
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:29,594
just as I came to find out
what happened to Zek.

784
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:31,096
That is linear.

785
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:33,181
And potentially
very annoying to you.

786
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:37,143
But, on the other hand,
if you leave me alone

787
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:40,605
and you put the Nagus back
the way he was when you met him,

788
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:43,400
I guarantee you,
you'll never have to talk

789
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,235
with another Ferengi again.

790
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:48,988
So what do you say?

791
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:51,783
Linguistic communication
is tiresome.

792
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,618
My point exactly.

793
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:56,288
Which is why I think
you should send me ba...

794
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,332
ZEK:
Quark.

795
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:01,834
Quark!

796
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:02,961
Quark...

797
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:04,503
are you all right?

798
00:41:05,422 --> 00:41:06,589
I think so.

799
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,341
What about you?

800
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:11,469
Oh, stop toadying up to me,
Quark, it's revolting.

801
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,096
Just get me out of here.

802
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:15,723
I have an Orb to sell
to the Bajorans.

803
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:17,516
Did you say "sell"?

804
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:20,519
I'm going to make them
pay through the nose.

805
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:23,064
(<i> laughs</i> )

806
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:26,401
Speaking of nose,
where is my beetle snuff?

807
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:28,403
Oh, Nagus, you're back.

808
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:30,113
I'm so happy.

809
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:32,782
You're wrinkling
my suit.

810
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:35,243
Whatever you say.

811
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:46,463
And now, it is with great pride
that I present the nominees

812
00:41:46,463 --> 00:41:48,547
for this year's
Carrington Award.

813
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:54,720
They are Dr. April Wade,
Senva of Vulcan,

814
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:59,100
Dr. Henri Roget,
Chirurgeon Ghee P'Trell,

815
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,893
and Dr. Julian Bashir.

816
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,603
Good luck.

817
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,816
The winner is...

818
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:08,651
Doctor...

819
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,611
Henri Roget.

820
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:13,865
Roget.

821
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,992
How could they
give it to Roget?

822
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:18,244
Better luck
next time.

823
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:21,164
Maybe... in
40 or 50 years.

824
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,333
Julian.

825
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:27,379
Sorry.

826
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:32,842
You seem to be
handling this well.

827
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:34,427
Believe me...

828
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:37,930
I'm not.

829
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,598
I didn't think so.

830
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,643
(<i> sneezing</i> )

831
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,937
Now, remember what
I said, Quark.

832
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:48,149
If anyone asks, you have
no idea what happened

833
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:49,608
to the charity money.

834
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:51,610
You can count on me.

835
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:55,156
And you're sure you've
destroyed every last copy

836
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:57,575
of<i> The Revised Rules</i>
<i>of Acquisition?</i>

837
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:01,746
The only place
the new Rules exist
is inside my head.

838
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:02,997
Eh?

839
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:03,915
Uh...

840
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:05,750
don't worry.

841
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,043
Within a week,

842
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:08,503
he'll have
forgotten them all.

843
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:10,547
He'd better.
(<i> sneezes</i> )

844
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,684
I don't believe it,
Brother.

845
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:26,729
After all you did
for the Nagus, he never
even thanked you.

846
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:30,567
He doesn't have to thank
me-- he's the Nagus.

847
00:43:30,567 --> 00:43:32,527
There's only one thing
that bothers me.

848
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:35,196
Don't get me wrong.
I was honored
to help the Nagus.

849
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:37,323
But it would have been
nice if I'd been able

850
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:39,742
to make a little profit
for all my troubles.

851
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,787
That's all right.
I made enough profit
for the both of us.

852
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:44,663
What are you
talking about?

853
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:47,750
I'm talking about the Ferengi
Benevolent Association.

854
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:51,463
Did you know it was funded
with Zek's personal fortune?

855
00:43:51,463 --> 00:43:55,174
I was the Senior
Administrator, Brother.

856
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:57,594
You embezzled money?
From the Nagus?

857
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:01,722
Surprise.

858
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:05,184
Father would be proud.

859
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:09,230
(<i> Quark laughing</i> )

860
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:11,690
(<i> both laughing</i> )
