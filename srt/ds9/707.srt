1
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:08,968
Come on. Santa Anna didn't care
about the rules of war.

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,804
If he had executed
Davy Crockett at the Alamo

3
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:13,764
he would have considered it
a point of pride.

4
00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:15,683
All right, put
it this way--

5
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:18,310
in 1836, Davy Crockett
was what, 49?

6
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,187
Quite old
for the standards of the time.

7
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:22,857
His days as an Indian fighter
were well behind him.

8
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:24,441
He was just an ex-Congressman--
all reputation.

9
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:26,067
Now, this is not a man

10
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,612
who was about to fight
till his last breath, Miles.

11
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:30,238
The situation was hopeless.

12
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,949
He was out of ammunition.

13
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:34,618
The Mexican army was storming
the Alamo's battlements.

14
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,954
He would have surrendered.

15
00:00:36,996 --> 00:00:39,164
It's as logical
as that-- simple.

16
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:41,834
I'm not saying
it couldn't have happened.

17
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:43,544
I'm just saying
there's no proof.

18
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,128
WORF:
You are
both wrong.

19
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,297
The only real question
is whether you believe

20
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:49,341
in the legend
of Davy Crockett or not.

21
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:50,718
If you do, then there should be

22
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,093
no doubt
in your mind

23
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,470
that he died
a hero's death.

24
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:55,389
If you do not believe
in the legend

25
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,641
then he was just a man

26
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:59,476
and it does not matter
how he died.

27
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,776
Well, I guess
that settles that.

28
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,904
I guess so.

29
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:12,781
(<i> door chimes</i> )

30
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,074
Enter.

31
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,286
Kor...

32
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,663
<i>Nuq'nuh,</i> Worf.

33
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:21,331
It's good to see you,
my friend.

34
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,334
I welcome you to my home.

35
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:27,629
May I offer you
some refreshment?

36
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:32,843
I would be honored to share
a bottle of bloodwine

37
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:34,428
with the son of Mogh.

38
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,437
I heard the news about Jadzia.

39
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,735
She died a warrior.

40
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:51,946
I expected
nothing less.

41
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,124
To absent comrades.

42
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:10,589
Mmm! 2309.
Very good.

43
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:11,757
Sit.

44
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,174
Oh.

45
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:16,762
The war goes, um,
well for you, Worf?

46
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:20,390
Um, a long list of victories
to your credit, I trust?

47
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:23,644
I have been... fortunate.

48
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:26,981
Oh-ho-ho, the way of the warrior
is not a humble path.

49
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:29,232
Show some pride
in your accomplishments.

50
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,525
You've earned it.

51
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,694
I will try.

52
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,321
(<i> chuckles</i> )

53
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,950
And does the war go well
for you, Kor?

54
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:44,039
No, Worf,
it does not go well for me.

55
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:46,125
It seems

56
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,209
my... services

57
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,545
are not required
in the present conflict.

58
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:54,508
But you are Kor--
a<i> Dahar</i> Master

59
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,384
the man who held
the Korma Pass

60
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,345
against T'nag.

61
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:01,765
Your reputation alone should
have assured you a command.

62
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:06,020
I also have a reputation
for a certain ruthless quality

63
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:08,772
towards those who
would stand in my way.

64
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:11,232
Mind you,
it's not entirely undeserved.

65
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:15,112
In truth, I rather enjoy being
feared by my fellow officers.

66
00:03:15,154 --> 00:03:19,240
However, there's a price
to be paid for such...

67
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:22,201
single-minded devotion
to one's ambition.

68
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,955
I've made enemies...
perhaps

69
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:26,957
more than were necessary.

70
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,839
I have no influence left
in the Empire.

71
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:36,091
Even as our
entire race

72
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,134
grapples with
the Dominion

73
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:38,468
there's no place

74
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,679
for an old man

75
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:44,933
with too many enemies
and not enough friends.

76
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:51,314
That's why
I've come here tonight.

77
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,525
It's not easy

78
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:57,821
for me to beg you for help...

79
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:00,782
but I have nowhere else to turn.

80
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:05,954
Help me fight again, Worf.

81
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:10,876
Help me end my life
as I've lived it--

82
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,128
as a warrior.

83
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:22,387
How many more reports
does the High Council require?

84
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:25,099
As many as last time.

85
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,768
And Starfleet is still
waiting for your signature

86
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,269
on these repair requests.

87
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,438
(<i> groans</i> )

88
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,274
There will come a day, Darok

89
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:38,112
when your services as my aide
will no longer be required.

90
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:42,657
I look forward to that day
with great anticipation.

91
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,658
Until then...

92
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,035
(<i> hatch opening</i> )

93
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:46,912
Ah, Worf!

94
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,038
Good to see you.

95
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,207
Thank you, Darok.

96
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,173
It's a pity
Captain Sisko

97
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,884
frowns on summary executions.

98
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,053
What can I do for you?

99
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:05,305
Kor, the<i> Dahar</i> Master

100
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,141
came to see me
last night.

101
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,934
He has been unable
to find a command and I...

102
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,227
Tell me you're
not going

103
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:11,853
to ask me
to give that man a ship.

104
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,022
Well, I had hoped...

105
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,275
Then your hopes are in vain.

106
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,069
That man is not welcome
in my House

107
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:20,487
and I will certainly
not have him

108
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,072
commanding a ship in my fleet.

109
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:24,992
General, Kor is a friend,
and I have already...

110
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,076
Not another word!

111
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:28,036
Do you hear?
Not one word!

112
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:35,752
Now get out of here
before I forget we are brothers.

113
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,306
MARTOK:
I plan to attack
the Trelka V Starbase

114
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,766
then push deeper
into Cardassian territory.

115
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,269
I'll hit the Manora shipyards

116
00:07:57,311 --> 00:08:00,521
the Jem'Hadar breeding
facility on Sheva II

117
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,400
the supply depots
in the Borias Cluster.

118
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:04,943
It would take half
the Ninth Fleet

119
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,987
just to destroy Trelka V.

120
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:10,490
I don't intend to destroy
the base, just damage it--

121
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,075
throw them off-balance

122
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:15,287
then move on
to the next target.

123
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:18,873
Imagine... the chaos we'll cause

124
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,251
once we're in
behind their lines.

125
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:23,711
A cavalry raid.

126
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,423
Ancient Earth soldiers
mounted on horseback.

127
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:28,549
They had the speed
to charge behind enemy lines

128
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,968
to stir up trouble

129
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,346
and the mobility
to keep from being caught.

130
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:34,931
How many ships will you take?

131
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,766
Five birds-of-prey.

132
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,559
Battle cruisers are too slow

133
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,270
too unwieldy
for a mission like this.

134
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:42,856
Do you want to take
the<i> Defiant?</i>

135
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,608
Perhaps the<i> Defiant</i>
should remain here

136
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:51,323
just in case the Jem'Hadar try
their own "cavalry raid," hmm?

137
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:54,159
But it may be prudent
for the<i> Defiant</i>

138
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,370
and a dozen or so
other starships

139
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,455
to be waiting for us
when we return.

140
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:01,208
You mean you might be bringing
company back with you?

141
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,585
I'm sure you'll be
ready to welcome them.

142
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,505
With phasers charged.

143
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,423
(<i> chuckles</i> )

144
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,176
(<i> both laughing</i> )

145
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,850
Our disruptor targeting sensors
need to be replaced

146
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,935
as well as our
guidance system relays.

147
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,271
Make a note of that
for Chief O'Brien.

148
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:26,733
He should give the<i> Ch'Tang</i>
first priority.

149
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,985
So, if you have something
to ask me, do it now

150
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,488
before Darok buries me
under more paperwork.

151
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,949
I wish to speak
with you about Kor.

152
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,493
Now, I know you have
strong feelings about...

153
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:38,828
Clear the Bridge!

154
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:55,136
I did not expect
to hear anything

155
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,264
further on this
subject from you.

156
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,558
And I did not expect
to be forbidden

157
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,684
to speak with you
on<i> any</i> subject.

158
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,020
Have I become a<i> shuVak</i>

159
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:07,148
to be ordered about
like Darok?

160
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,569
No.

161
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,653
Of course not.

162
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,282
Very well.

163
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:18,410
Talk and be
done with it.

164
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:26,667
Kor came to see me,
asking my help as a friend.

165
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:31,298
He is an old man

166
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:34,092
with no family and no influence
left in the Empire.

167
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:37,720
He asked nothing
except for the chance

168
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,181
to fight and die
as a Klingon warrior.

169
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:42,183
I told him I would
speak with you

170
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,644
about finding him
a command in the fleet.

171
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:50,108
I would not give that man
the gnawed bones of my last meal

172
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,693
much less command of a ship.

173
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,112
But why?

174
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,781
There is no blood feud
between our Houses

175
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:59,117
and Kor has said
he has not even met you.

176
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:07,125
You can wound a man
without ever seeing his face.

177
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,294
(<i> stamps foot</i> )

178
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:14,257
When I was a boy,
my family still lived

179
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:15,967
in the lowlands
of Ketha Province.

180
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,470
We had very little,
but it didn't matter.

181
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:21,306
We were a family of warriors.

182
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:24,058
15 generations had served
as soldiers of the Empire

183
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,188
but my father had
higher hopes for me.

184
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:32,275
He wanted his son
to become an officer.

185
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,693
(<i> chuckles</i> ):
It took a great deal of effort

186
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:39,073
but eventually, he found someone
willing to sponsor me.

187
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:42,701
I passed my entrance exam
on my first attempt

188
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:45,246
and all that remained
was final approval

189
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:48,416
by the Oversight Council--
a simple formality.

190
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,671
My application was rejected

191
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:58,301
by one member
of that council-- Kor.

192
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:01,137
Why?

193
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:04,683
"Why?"

194
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:07,810
Kor's family descends
from the Imperial Court itself.

195
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,354
Kor is "of the blood"--

196
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:12,232
born to rule
by the divine will of Kahless

197
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,608
and what was I?

198
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,735
A boy from the
Ketha lowlands.

199
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,446
He could not bear the thought

200
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:22,242
of someone like me joining
the elite officer ranks

201
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:25,078
and so, to my father's
embarrassment

202
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,829
and my everlasting shame...

203
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,666
my application was denied.

204
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,294
And with the mark
of Kor on my record

205
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:36,297
I could not join
even as a common soldier.

206
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:40,093
I spent five years
as a civilian laborer

207
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,011
aboard General
ShiVang's flagship.

208
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:47,225
Then... as fortune
would have it

209
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:52,105
the Romulans made a foolhardy
attempt to board our ship.

210
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:56,192
I earned
a battlefield commission.

211
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:59,446
Unfortunately...

212
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:04,242
my father did not live
to see that glorious day.

213
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:12,166
And if Kor had had his way

214
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,670
I would still be
a civilian on that ship

215
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,380
cleaning
the officers' mess.

216
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,299
I understand

217
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,385
but I must tell you
that using my own authority

218
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:25,179
I appointed Kor
an officer in the Ninth Fleet.

219
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:30,685
Made him an officer...
just like that.

220
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:34,063
That's the difference
between his name and mine--

221
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:38,485
his opens doors,
mine closes them.

222
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,736
I did not anticipate...

223
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:40,987
It's done!

224
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:43,531
Your apology is not sought

225
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:46,117
but know this, Worf...

226
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:50,037
Kor is<i> your</i> responsibility.

227
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,707
I want nothing
to do with him.

228
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,256
Do you...
do you remember

229
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,550
breaking into
the Duke's harem on Renavi?

230
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,885
Oh.

231
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,096
How could I
forget that?

232
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:09,724
That is one of Curzon's
favorite memories.

233
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,976
(<i> Ezri and Kor laughing</i> )

234
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,936
Hi.

235
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:16,523
Hello.

236
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,107
KOR:
Come and join us

237
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:19,192
my friend.

238
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:22,362
Uh... I am on duty.

239
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,698
I'll see you later.

240
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:25,782
Mmm.

241
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:30,036
It's good to see
you again, Kor.

242
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,287
Mm-hmm.

243
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:36,501
Still the same old Dax...

244
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,294
and yet not.

245
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:40,421
General Martok will<i> not</i>
give you a command.

246
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:43,174
Uh...<i> kesh!</i>

247
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,592
He says that

248
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:47,094
you struck his name
from an officers list

249
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,930
because his family comes
from the Ketha lowlands.

250
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,307
Did I?

251
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,977
I don't recall.

252
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,105
Of course, there were
so many officer lists.

253
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,982
I suppose it's possible.

254
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:03,820
It is an unworthy reason to bar
a man from serving the Empire.

255
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,989
Worf, you've been living

256
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:10,660
among this democratic rabble
for too long.

257
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:12,245
I know your bloodline.

258
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:15,582
We both come from noble Houses.

259
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:19,001
Among our people,
that still counts for something.

260
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,628
If Martok
is a true Klingon

261
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,629
he should
appreciate that.

262
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:22,922
He does not.

263
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,298
(<i> snorts in disdain</i> )

264
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:29,220
Did he revoke my commission?

265
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,514
No. You will serve
aboard the<i> Ch'Tang...</i>

266
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,517
as Third Officer.

267
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,644
Third?

268
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:39,105
(<i> scoffing</i> )

269
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,273
(<i> sigh of resignation</i> )

270
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,400
Oh, well... huh, no matter.

271
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,945
I've overcome greater obstacles.

272
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:48,698
Thank you, Worf.
You're a true friend.

273
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:52,535
You will report aboard at 0700

274
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:55,705
and stay out of Martok's way.

275
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:59,208
He will not even know
I am there.

276
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,797
Worf!

277
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:06,424
Uh... what was the
name of that ship?

278
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,967
Oh, the<i> Ch'Tang.</i>

279
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,636
<i>Ch'Tang!</i> Of course.

280
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,345
I'll see you there.

281
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,320
OFFICER:
All decks report ready.

282
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,321
Defense systems on-line.

283
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,823
Engine room standing by.

284
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,365
Transporter room reports
that our last crew members

285
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,325
have beamed aboard.

286
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:33,326
Very well.

287
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,327
Signal the squadron.

288
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,578
Prepare to
get under way.

289
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,330
Stand by to cloak.

290
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,372
Aye, sir.

291
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:43,210
Helm, set course 325 mark 003.

292
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,087
Full impulse till we
clear the outer marker.

293
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,673
Then go to...

294
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,512
Third Officer Kor
reporting for duty.

295
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,138
The<i> Dahar</i> Master.

296
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,474
(<i> soft growling</i> )

297
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,434
Take your station.

298
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,991
MARTOK:
Return to your duties

299
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,242
or I will find a crew that can.

300
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,661
Helmsman

301
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,454
I gave you
an order.

302
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,164
<i>chaH-Veh!</i>

303
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,300
Kor...

304
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:34,303
here on our ship.

305
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,305
(<i> laughing</i> )

306
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:38,599
Don't you have
something to do?

307
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,394
No.

308
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,354
Then find something!

309
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,657
It's an honor to have you
aboard with us.

310
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:57,368
Ah, thank you very much.

311
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,453
Welcome,<i> Dahar</i> Master.

312
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,884
So what did Kor say
when he met you?

313
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,469
The usual.

314
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,765
I have the same conversation
over and over again.

315
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,683
Everyone's
shocked at first.

316
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,685
Then they start
scanning my face

317
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:25,605
for signs of the person
they knew as Dax.

318
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,273
"It can't be.

319
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,525
"Is it really you?

320
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:32,403
"Oh, I do see
a little Jadzia in the eyes

321
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,530
a little Curzon
in the smile."

322
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,783
Isn't there a period
of adjustment

323
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,785
that joined Trills
have to go through

324
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,453
where people
are comparing them

325
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,537
to previous hosts?

326
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,748
I'm, I'm sure it'll pass.

327
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:47,585
You're right.

328
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,879
The last five Dax hosts
went through this.

329
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:50,964
Ah.

330
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,508
That wasn't bad.

331
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,260
You'd make a pretty
good Counselor.

332
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,470
You want to trade jobs?

333
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,888
Oh, yeah-- people
would love

334
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,306
bringing their
problems to me.

335
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,641
"You dreamt about what?

336
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:02,809
"You're crazy.

337
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,310
"Now get out
of my office.

338
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,062
Next patient."

339
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:10,024
It's funny you should
mention dreams.

340
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,944
Ever since
my conversation with Kor

341
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:15,446
I have had the most
intense dreams about him.

342
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:16,823
Like what?

343
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,741
Being on a Klingon
Bridge together...

344
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,367
going off
into battle...

345
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,953
drinking bloodwine--

346
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:23,579
which still makes me gag

347
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:24,872
by the way.

348
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,749
Singing songs...

349
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,460
A part of me wants to be
out there with him now.

350
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,587
I hope he's
all right.

351
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,506
I mean, I know I'm sort
of contradicting

352
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,091
what I just said
about wanting

353
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:37,551
to set myself apart
from my previous hosts

354
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:41,055
but the memories I have
of being with him

355
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:42,389
are so vivid.

356
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,142
I can't bear the
thought of losing him.

357
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,020
I'd give almost anything
for the chance to...

358
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:49,605
be together just one more time--

359
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:53,109
the two of us side by side,
just like it used to be.

360
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,032
Do you need something?

361
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,201
No.

362
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,246
Nothing.

363
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,922
So, what's your
professional opinion?

364
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:17,633
Mmm... you're crazy.

365
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:19,593
Next patient.

366
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,433
What's the matter
with you?

367
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,227
Someone forget
to leave a tip?

368
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:32,648
It's Ezri.

369
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:33,858
She... she...

370
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,068
I can't even say it.

371
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:37,904
Try.

372
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:41,032
She wants to get back
together with Worf.

373
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:46,746
And before the Cardassians
ever knew we were there

374
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,749
we destroyed the entire camp
and the relay station.

375
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,375
(<i> all laughing</i> )

376
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,836
To General Martok--
victor of Felton Prime.

377
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:55,088
(<i> soft growl</i> )

378
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:56,422
ALL:
<i>Qapla'!</i>

379
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,634
OFFICER:
Let me have the honor

380
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,553
to welcome
the<i> Dahar</i> Master

381
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,847
to the humble mess hall
of the<i> Ch'Tang.</i>

382
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:05,848
Oh, sit, sit.

383
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,767
You do me too much honor.

384
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,853
On this voyage,
I am but the Third Officer.

385
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:13,022
I expect no special treatment.

386
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:15,858
OFFICER:
May I serve you<i> gagh,</i>
<i>Dahar</i> Master?

387
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,611
Have you settled on
an attack plan

388
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,654
for the starbase
on Trelka V?

389
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,534
I'm going to send
the<i> Malpara</i> and the<i> Ning'tao</i>

390
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:26,619
in ahead of the rest
of the squadron.

391
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,787
They'll make

392
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,496
a single strafing run
of the base

393
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,582
then head out
of the system.

394
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:33,542
When the enemy sends out
their repair crews

395
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:36,462
to assess the damage,
then the rest

396
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,505
of the squadron
will de-cloak.

397
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,550
With any luck, we'll catch
them not only unprepared

398
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:44,720
but with their entire damage
control effort under way.

399
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:45,846
Excellent.

400
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:48,307
An excellent plan, General.

401
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,558
I'm glad you approve.

402
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,935
KOR:
Of course.

403
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:52,853
It's the same tactic
Kang and I used

404
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:55,731
against the Federation
in the Battle of Caleb IV.

405
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,150
You were at
Caleb IV?

406
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:58,943
Of course
he was.

407
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:00,820
Forgive the
ignorance of
these children.

408
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:01,988
(<i> chuckling</i> )

409
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,739
I was a young officer once.

410
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:06,408
I know how irrelevant
the past can seem.

411
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,576
We would be honored

412
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:08,995
if you would tell us
about Caleb IV.

413
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:09,912
(<i> all agreeing</i> )

414
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:10,871
DAROK:
Tell the tale.

415
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:12,456
OFFICER:
Tell us.

416
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,333
KOR:
Well, there's not much
to tell, really.

417
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:15,793
The battle was over

418
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,796
almost before the Federation
knew it had begun.

419
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:22,508
I commanded the First Division
from the<i> Klothos--</i>

420
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:25,052
one of the old D-5 cruisers.

421
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:27,513
Kang commanded
the Second Division.

422
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:30,891
Now, you must remember
that in those days

423
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:34,770
the cloaking device was
a new piece of technology.

424
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:36,022
(<i> laughing</i> )

425
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,024
There were only
a handful of engineers

426
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,776
in the Imperial Fleet
who knew how to operate them.

427
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:42,736
Before we left Chronos

428
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,905
I spent three days
in the Engine Room

429
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,824
taking the
device apart

430
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:47,908
with my bare hands...

431
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,618
(<i> clanking</i> )

432
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,578
and then putting it
back together again.

433
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,788
Now, this would
come in handy

434
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,624
later in the battle,
as you'll see.

435
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:58,919
It is not the fault
of the crew.

436
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:00,338
They are not
used to serving

437
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:04,217
with a legendary
figure like Kor.

438
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:05,801
OFFICER (<i> on com</i> ):
Bridge to General Martok.

439
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:07,803
Yes.

440
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:09,638
OFFICER:
We are approaching Trelka V.

441
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,765
Set defense condition one.

442
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:12,808
(<i> warning signal blares</i> )

443
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,476
OFFICER:
Defense condition one.

444
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,354
All hands to battle stations.

445
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:19,439
Repeat, all hands
to battle stations.

446
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:26,030
(<i> warning signal continues</i> )

447
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,912
I'm supposed to be somewhere.

448
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,412
<i>Dahar</i> Master?

449
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:35,915
Where are you going,
Lieutenant?

450
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,208
To, to the Bridge.

451
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,709
We're approaching
Trelka V.

452
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,544
The Bridge!

453
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:41,628
Are you all right?

454
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,880
Of course.

455
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,798
What are you waiting for?

456
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,883
Report to your station.

457
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,009
<i>chaH-Veh!</i>

458
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,470
Concentrate!

459
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:09,907
OFFICER:
Their shields are
down to 65 percent.

460
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,992
Three Cardassian cruisers
are in spacedock

461
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:13,911
orbiting on the far
side of the planet.

462
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:16,414
Two of them are
getting under way.

463
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:17,664
The<i> Malpara</i>
and the<i> Ning'tao</i>

464
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,041
have completed their attack.

465
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,141
The<i> Malpara</i> is gone...

466
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:38,352
No survivors.

467
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:40,271
The<i> Ning'tao</i> is heading
out of the system.

468
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:41,939
The Cardassians
are pursuing.

469
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,232
MARTOK:
And leaving
their base

470
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:44,566
unprotected.

471
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:45,985
Helm, take us in.

472
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,527
Bring us
to a hover

473
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:48,946
300 meters
above the base.

474
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:49,947
Stand by
to de-cloak

475
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:52,074
on my command.

476
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:54,243
Holding at 300 meters.

477
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:55,661
Scan the base.

478
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:57,579
They've dispatched
damage control teams.

479
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:00,374
Two defense batteries are out.

480
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,876
And they've just dropped
their primary shield grid.

481
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,628
De-cloak the ship

482
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,380
and open fire.

483
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,728
(<i> groaning</i> )

484
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,981
Shields are down to 85 percent.

485
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,316
(<i> yells</i> )

486
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:26,817
Reroute emergency power
to secondary

487
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,068
shield emitters.

488
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,070
Fire torpedoes!

489
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:33,949
Helm, lay in an escape course.

490
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:34,908
(<i> yells</i> )

491
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,534
Aye, sir.

492
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,207
(<i> console beeping</i> )

493
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:48,588
KOR:
Continue firing.

494
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,548
Target their primary reactors.

495
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,842
<i>chaH-Veh.</i>

496
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,344
And bring us around
for another pass.

497
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:54,678
Coming about.

498
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,930
(<i> weakly</i> ):
No... only one pass.

499
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,857
Leave the system.

500
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,486
Do not worry, my friend.

501
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:11,778
All is well.

502
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,198
You old... fool!

503
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:16,075
OFFICER:
The<i> Orantho</i> reports

504
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:18,035
their Captain
and First Officer are dead.

505
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:19,495
They have a hull breach
in their port quarter.

506
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:21,497
Instruct them to continue firing

507
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:23,707
and open a
channel to Kang.

508
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:25,792
To Kang?

509
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,669
Tell him we've succeeded

510
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,630
and that the Federation
outpost on Caleb IV

511
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:33,050
will be taken within an hour.

512
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:37,096
Sir, Kang has been dead
for years.

513
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,891
Prepare a boarding party.

514
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,476
We're going to take the base.

515
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:44,644
But, sir, they have
a garrison of 10,000.

516
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:48,232
By the hand of Kahless,
get us out of here!

517
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,235
Victory is ours.

518
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:53,737
The Federation
will rue the day

519
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:57,450
they dared to challenge
the might of the Klingon Empire.

520
00:26:57,491 --> 00:27:00,119
We will take
Caleb IV

521
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,328
and raise

522
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:04,290
our banner
over the smoking ruins

523
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:05,499
of their outpost.

524
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:13,507
Escape course,<i> now!</i>

525
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:22,516
MARTOK:
Engage cloaks.

526
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:24,642
(<i> groaning</i> )

527
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:29,607
<i>Orantho</i> and
<i>Slivin</i> have cloaked.

528
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,733
No pursuit from Trelka V.

529
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,986
No time to waste.

530
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:37,072
Proceed... proceed
to the rendezvous

531
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:38,449
and then on to the
Manora shipyards.

532
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:40,284
Warp 7.

533
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:41,994
Medical team
to the Bridge.

534
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:46,290
Worf, get that man out of here.

535
00:28:25,663 --> 00:28:27,873
Hi. I think I'm in
the mood for a...

536
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:29,124
Wait.

537
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:32,169
I have something to say.

538
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:36,089
Now, you may think
this is none of my business

539
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,633
but someone has
to speak up

540
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:39,635
and I've decided
that someone is me.

541
00:28:39,677 --> 00:28:42,429
So, here it is.
I'll just say it.

542
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:44,848
Okay.

543
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:53,982
You're making a mistake

544
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:56,193
by pursuing another
relationship with Worf.

545
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:57,653
Excuse me?

546
00:28:57,695 --> 00:28:58,778
You heard me.

547
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,989
I know how Jadzia
felt about Worf

548
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:03,158
but that was her life,
not yours.

549
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,910
You're Ezri Dax.

550
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,286
You need
to give yourself

551
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:09,206
a chance to explore
other relationships.

552
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:12,209
You're young... and beautiful

553
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:14,336
and full of life.

554
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:17,673
Why go after a man
who's only a memory to you?

555
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:20,133
I've had my problems
with Worf, I'll admit that

556
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,801
but this is not about
me or my feelings.

557
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,845
This is about you.

558
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:28,308
Worf has done nothing,
and I mean<i> nothing</i>

559
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,893
to deserve you.

560
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:33,272
Shouldn't you try
and find someone

561
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:35,815
who's willing
to win your heart

562
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:38,068
not just inherit it?

563
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,696
You deserve better.

564
00:29:40,738 --> 00:29:43,282
There.
I've said my piece.

565
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:48,203
Can I say something now?

566
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:53,584
I'm not interested in having
another relationship with Worf.

567
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:55,461
I care about him

568
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:58,422
and I probably always will,
but he's moved on with his life

569
00:29:58,464 --> 00:29:59,632
and so have I.

570
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:01,425
Oh. Well, good.

571
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:05,929
And I'd also like to say
that what you just did

572
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:09,057
was one of the kindest,
dearest, and for you

573
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:10,976
one of the most
embarrassing things

574
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:12,185
that I have
ever heard.

575
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,152
You're a real
sweetheart.

576
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,448
Can I order now?

577
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,616
Mm-hmm.

578
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:27,493
A Moscow mule.

579
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,035
Coming right up.

580
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:38,420
Did you hear that?

581
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:40,255
She called me "sweetheart."

582
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:41,715
Yeah? So?

583
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:43,883
She loves me.

584
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,594
What?

585
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:49,055
"Sweetheart."

586
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:52,142
You're certifiable,
you do realize that?

587
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:53,935
She loves me.

588
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,061
(<i> sighs</i> )

589
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,772
(<i> door opens</i> )

590
00:30:56,814 --> 00:30:58,482
MARTOK:
Find out what's wrong
with the<i> Ning'tao.</i>

591
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:00,275
I know Captain Lurkan is young

592
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:02,319
but he must realize
the importance...

593
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,617
the importance
of keeping formation.

594
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:14,122
I've been thinking
about our next objective.

595
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:16,375
Perhaps we should
go after a bigger target

596
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,377
something more threatening
to our forces.

597
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:21,880
Now, what about the base
on Caleb IV?

598
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:23,173
(<i> Officer chuckles</i> )

599
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:25,050
DAROK:
If you'll excuse me,
I have duties

600
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:26,259
to attend to.

601
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,470
Your duties are right here.

602
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,894
Someone was just telling me

603
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,521
about the defenses
on Caleb IV.

604
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:38,980
Who was that?

605
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:40,357
OFFICER:
I believe it was

606
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,317
our Third
Officer, General.

607
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:45,487
That's right.
Third Officer.

608
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:47,447
Tell us about Caleb IV.

609
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:50,992
Is it manned by Jem'Hadar
or Cardassian troops?

610
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,452
I thought it was
a Federation outpost.

611
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:54,413
How can that be?

612
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,331
The Federation
is our ally.

613
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:58,584
Surely Kor is
aware of<i> that.</i>

614
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,753
Perhaps he's confused.

615
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:03,255
Confused? The
<i>Dahar</i> Master?

616
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:04,964
Surely not.

617
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:07,092
<i>We</i> must be the ones
who are confused.

618
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,927
Enlighten us.

619
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:11,513
Who mans the base
on Caleb IV--

620
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:13,807
Dominion or Federation?

621
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:17,227
I think he's forgotten.

622
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:18,896
I think he's asleep.

623
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,146
MARTOK:
Stop it!

624
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,189
Both of you.

625
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:25,318
Don't you have
any respect

626
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,530
for one of the greatest
heroes of the Empire?

627
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,366
He's thinking it over.

628
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:33,786
Give him time.

629
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:41,501
The last son of the House
of Kor should not be rushed.

630
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:44,546
How long should we wait?

631
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:46,632
Perhaps we
should ask Kang!

632
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:58,477
Well, say something, old man

633
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:02,230
or have you lost your tongue
as well as your mind?

634
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:13,492
Savor the fruit of life,
my<i> young</i> friends.

635
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:18,163
It has a sweet taste
when it is fresh from the vine

636
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:21,166
but don't live too long.

637
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:24,419
The taste turns bitter...

638
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:28,715
after a time.

639
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,275
The new personnel roster.

640
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:55,325
You've removed Kor
from active duty.

641
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:57,369
I saw no other choice.

642
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,912
Still, you're his friend.

643
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:00,580
It must have been
difficult for you.

644
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:02,332
A friend would not
have put him

645
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,209
in that position
in the first place.

646
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:11,049
I've hated his name
for almost 30 years.

647
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,302
I've dreamt of the moment
when I would finally see him

648
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:16,054
stripped of his rank and title

649
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:17,848
when he would
suddenly find himself

650
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:19,474
without a friend
in the world

651
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:22,060
without the power
of his birthright.

652
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:26,523
Well, I've had
that moment now.

653
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,653
And I took no joy from it.

654
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,991
Have you thought about
what will become of him

655
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:38,702
when we return
to Deep Space 9?

656
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:41,287
I plan to speak with
Chancellor Gowron

657
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:46,334
to try and find Kor some
assignment on the Homeworld.

658
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:50,255
I'll have a word
with Gowron as well.

659
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,382
Bridge to General Martok.

660
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:53,633
Yes?

661
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:55,385
Pardon the interruption, sir.

662
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:59,097
Our sensors have detected
a large body of enemy ships.

663
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:00,306
On my way.

664
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,018
(<i> warning signal blares</i> )

665
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,436
Where are they?

666
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,855
Their warp signatures
are bearing directly astern.

667
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:08,398
They're Jem'Hadar fighters

668
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,316
and they appear
to be pursuing us.

669
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:11,818
How can that be?

670
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,319
The lead ship
is using some sort

671
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,404
of long-range
tachyon scanner

672
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:15,697
to penetrate our cloaks.

673
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:17,908
Does the Dominion possess
such a device?

674
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,492
They do now.

675
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,660
How many ships?

676
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:22,454
I've identified
ten vessels so far.

677
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:26,165
(<i> sighs</i> ):
And they're gaining on us.

678
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:35,133
WORF:
How long before

679
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,885
we are within their
weapons' range?

680
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:38,971
Two hours, 12 minutes.

681
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:41,514
Helm... have you located
the<i> Defiant?</i>

682
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,391
Yes, sir. They're
waiting for us

683
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:46,478
in the Kalandra Sector with
seven Federation starships.

684
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,896
It will take us...

685
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:50,231
three hours, 45 minutes
to reach them.

686
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,776
If the Jem'Hadar could be forced

687
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:55,112
to drop out of warp
for only ten minutes

688
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,114
they would not have time
to catch up with us

689
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,032
before we rendezvous
with the<i> Defiant.</i>

690
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:02,035
It's a fine theory,
but how do we execute it?

691
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,663
We could disrupt
their warp fields

692
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:07,082
with an inverse
graviton burst.

693
00:36:07,124 --> 00:36:08,959
It would force them
to drop to impulse

694
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:10,877
until the gravitons
dissipated.

695
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:12,378
We would need to generate
a massive burst

696
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,547
to disrupt the warp fields
of a fleet that size.

697
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,925
A single bird-of-prey
could do it by diverting

698
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:18,635
warp power to the
main deflector.

699
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:19,594
How long would that delay them?

700
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:20,846
They could

701
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:21,930
reinitialize their warp cores

702
00:36:21,972 --> 00:36:23,306
in less than two minutes.

703
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,101
If I could engage
them in battle

704
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:28,103
while they are
still at impulse

705
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:30,522
that would delay
them even longer.

706
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,565
I know I could do it.

707
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,526
What do you mean,
<i>you</i> could do it?

708
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,154
The<i> Orantho's</i> Captain
and First Officer are dead

709
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,531
and the<i> Slivin's </i>
deflector is damaged

710
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:42,075
and cannot generate
a graviton burst...

711
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:45,453
and the<i> Ning'tao's</i> Captain
is too young and inexperienced.

712
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:48,456
I am the logical choice.

713
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,502
But, Worf...

714
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:55,130
this means that
you'd be sacrificing

715
00:36:55,172 --> 00:36:59,092
the... entire crew
of the<i> Ning'tao.</i>

716
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:01,887
I have thought
about that.

717
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,930
We could beam most
of the crew over

718
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:05,348
before I take command.

719
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,476
I would only need
six volunteers.

720
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,572
Signal the<i> Ning'tao.</i>

721
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:23,491
Tell them to prepare
for a change in command.

722
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:28,538
(<i> door chimes</i> )

723
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,165
Yes?

724
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,419
I'm not hungry.

725
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,462
The food is for me.

726
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:39,216
I haven't eaten in hours.

727
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,842
Men of our generation

728
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:43,261
never stood on
ceremony, huh?

729
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:44,303
(<i> laughing</i> )

730
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,181
We ate when we
were hungry.

731
00:37:46,223 --> 00:37:48,433
We fought when
we were angered.

732
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:54,355
Oh... I miss
the simplicity
of those days.

733
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:57,316
I miss a great deal
about those days.

734
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,903
The warriors
on this ship...

735
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:02,405
they don't know
what they've missed

736
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,950
but such is the
way with children.

737
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,325
Hmm?

738
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:09,079
They often let the
promise of the future

739
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:12,124
obscure the glories
of the past.

740
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:15,334
Is there a point
to this nostalgic indulgence?

741
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:18,964
Only that they
<i>are</i> children.

742
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:23,802
Even Martok, who,
for all his flaws,
is a great man

743
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:29,057
even Martok is but
a child compared
to you or me.

744
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:33,103
They are quick to judge,
but slow to forgive.

745
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:36,106
They still have
much to learn.

746
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:44,990
We are being pursued
by a Jem'Hadar fleet.

747
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,575
Worf believes he can stop them

748
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:49,452
with a single ship.

749
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:50,870
How?

750
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:55,083
It's a good plan...

751
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:58,044
but it has one flaw.

752
00:38:58,086 --> 00:39:00,922
It depends entirely
on Worf successfully

753
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:03,549
engaging the whole
enemy fleet

754
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:06,511
if only for a short time.

755
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,183
It can be done.

756
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:13,810
The key is to confuse
their sensors

757
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:18,315
in the opening moments...
with a spread of torpedoes.

758
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:19,398
Perhaps.

759
00:39:21,151 --> 00:39:24,654
But it would take a man
with three times his experience

760
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:26,990
to accomplish
such a feat

761
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:33,330
and such a man... would have
to be certain of his abilities.

762
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:37,250
Such a man
would not take the job...

763
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:41,087
unless he<i> were</i> certain.

764
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:51,973
It has been an honor serving
with you, Kor, son of Rynar.

765
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:08,406
Worf!

766
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:14,954
Leaving for
the<i> Ning'tao,</i>
I take it?

767
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:16,039
Yes.

768
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:17,999
I wanted to
wish you well.

769
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:19,959
I look forward
to seeing you

770
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:22,087
at the gates
to<i> Sto-Vo-Kor.</i>

771
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:25,673
As do I.

772
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:27,092
Do you have any message

773
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:29,552
you want me to convey
to Jadzia?

774
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:30,970
(<i> grunts</i> )

775
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:37,143
When I reach the Halls
of the Hallowed Dead

776
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:39,271
I will find your beloved

777
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:43,149
and remind her that her husband
is a noble warrior

778
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:46,945
and that he still loves
no one but her.

779
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:49,989
Good-bye, my friend.

780
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:51,532
Live well.

781
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,379
Long live the Empire.

782
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,652
On the Bridge?

783
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:30,989
If they succeed, you can
drink to their courage...

784
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,490
and if they fail

785
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:34,951
you can still drink
to their courage.

786
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,161
The<i> Ning'tao</i>

787
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:37,536
is closing on the enemy.

788
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:40,081
She's initiated
the graviton burst.

789
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:43,293
Their warp fields
are destabilizing.

790
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:45,503
They're dropping to impulse.

791
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:47,088
By Kahless' hand... how many?

792
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:49,424
All of them.

793
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:51,884
The<i> Ning'tao</i> has
dropped out of warp.

794
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,136
She's engaging
the enemy.

795
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,057
Die well, Worf.

796
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:02,354
Today was not
my day to die.

797
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,357
Worf!

798
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:08,067
But then who...?

799
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:09,694
Kor!

800
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:12,238
He surprised me
outside the transporter room

801
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,448
with a hypospray.

802
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:18,619
I hope that old fool
understands what he's doing.

803
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,246
How goes the battle?

804
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:23,291
We're approaching the limit
of our sensor range...

805
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:26,127
but it appears that the enemy
formation has collapsed.

806
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:28,505
The<i> Ning'tao</i> is
maneuvering rapidly.

807
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:32,133
She's taking heavy fire
from the Jem'Hadar.

808
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:37,096
I've lost contact.

809
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:41,976
One ship... against ten...

810
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:44,229
it doesn't seem possible.

811
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,813
He will succeed.

812
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:47,982
He is Kor--

813
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:50,068
the<i> Dahar</i> Master.

814
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,414
He's done it.

815
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:04,457
The Jem'Hadar
are out of time.

816
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:08,920
They can no longer overtake us
before we reach the<i> Defiant.</i>

817
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:12,173
How... how did that
pompous old man

818
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:14,426
hold off an entire
Jem'Hadar fleet

819
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:16,428
with only one ship?

820
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:18,471
Does it matter?

821
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:24,602
Darok, give me that bottle.

822
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:29,148
To Kor...

823
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:31,025
the<i> Dahar</i> Master...

824
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:33,403
a noble warrior
to the end.
