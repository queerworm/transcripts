1
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,109
Come on. Santa Anna didn't care
about the rules of war.

2
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:11,979
If he had executed
Davy Crockett at the Alamo

3
00:00:12,016 --> 00:00:14,009
he would have considered it
a point of pride.

4
00:00:14,053 --> 00:00:15,920
All right, put it this way...

5
00:00:15,957 --> 00:00:18,758
in 1836, Davy Crockett
was what, 49?

6
00:00:18,796 --> 00:00:20,595
Quite old
for the standards of the time.

7
00:00:20,633 --> 00:00:23,035
His days as an Indian fighter
were well behind him.

8
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:25,166
He was just an ex-Congressman...
all reputation.

9
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:26,301
Now, this is not a man

10
00:00:26,344 --> 00:00:28,814
who was about to fight
till his last breath, Miles.

11
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:30,751
The situation was hopeless.

12
00:00:30,787 --> 00:00:32,221
He was out of ammunition.

13
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:35,023
The Mexican army was storming
the Alamo's battlements.

14
00:00:35,062 --> 00:00:37,430
He would have surrendered.

15
00:00:37,466 --> 00:00:39,629
It's as logical as that...
simple.

16
00:00:39,671 --> 00:00:42,141
I'm not saying
it couldn't have happened.

17
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:43,873
I'm just saying
there's no proof.

18
00:00:43,913 --> 00:00:45,542
You are both wrong.

19
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:47,678
The only real question
is whether you believe

20
00:00:47,721 --> 00:00:49,691
in the legend
of Davy Crockett or not.

21
00:00:49,725 --> 00:00:51,216
If you do, then there should be

22
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,959
no doubt in your mind
that he died a hero's death.

23
00:00:53,999 --> 00:00:55,992
If you do not believe
in the legend

24
00:00:56,037 --> 00:00:57,939
then he was just a man

25
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:00,035
and it does not matter
how he died.

26
00:01:06,557 --> 00:01:08,186
Well, I guess
that settles that.

27
00:01:08,228 --> 00:01:10,289
I guess so.

28
00:01:13,271 --> 00:01:14,398
Enter.

29
00:01:17,814 --> 00:01:18,907
Kor...

30
00:01:18,949 --> 00:01:20,144
<i>Nuq'nuh,</i> Worf.

31
00:01:20,185 --> 00:01:21,916
It's good to see you,
my friend.

32
00:01:23,057 --> 00:01:24,924
I welcome you to my home.

33
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:27,992
May I offer you
some refreshment?

34
00:01:30,272 --> 00:01:33,267
I would be honored to share
a bottle of bloodwine

35
00:01:33,311 --> 00:01:34,802
with the son of Mogh.

36
00:01:41,494 --> 00:01:44,057
I heard the news about Jadzia.

37
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,272
She died a warrior.

38
00:01:50,312 --> 00:01:52,578
I expected nothing less.

39
00:02:03,104 --> 00:02:04,538
To absent comrades.

40
00:02:08,581 --> 00:02:11,109
Mmm! 2309.
Very good.

41
00:02:11,153 --> 00:02:12,280
Sit.

42
00:02:12,322 --> 00:02:13,756
Oh.

43
00:02:13,792 --> 00:02:17,128
The war goes, um,
well for you, Worf?

44
00:02:17,165 --> 00:02:20,866
Um, a long list of victories
to your credit, I trust?

45
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:24,141
I have been... fortunate.

46
00:02:24,179 --> 00:02:27,447
Oh-ho-ho, the way of the warrior
is not a humble path.

47
00:02:27,486 --> 00:02:29,786
Show some pride
in your accomplishments.

48
00:02:29,824 --> 00:02:31,053
You've earned it.

49
00:02:31,093 --> 00:02:33,222
I will try.

50
00:02:36,203 --> 00:02:38,400
And does the war go well
for you, Kor?

51
00:02:41,514 --> 00:02:44,509
No, Worf,
it does not go well for me.

52
00:02:45,555 --> 00:02:48,686
It seems my... services

53
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:51,131
are not required
in the present conflict.

54
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:55,005
But you are Kor...
a <i>Dahar</i> Master

55
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:58,377
the man who held the Korma Pass
against T'nag.

56
00:02:58,448 --> 00:03:02,320
Your reputation alone should
have assured you a command.

57
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:06,557
I also have a reputation
for a certain ruthless quality

58
00:03:06,597 --> 00:03:09,330
towards those who
would stand in my way.

59
00:03:09,403 --> 00:03:11,771
Mind you,
it's not entirely undeserved.

60
00:03:11,808 --> 00:03:15,339
In truth, I rather enjoy being
feared by my fellow officers.

61
00:03:15,448 --> 00:03:19,855
However, there's a price
to be paid for such...

62
00:03:19,891 --> 00:03:22,829
single-minded devotion
to one's ambition.

63
00:03:22,864 --> 00:03:25,495
I've made enemies...
perhaps

64
00:03:25,535 --> 00:03:27,630
more than were necessary.

65
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:34,384
I have no influence left
in the Empire.

66
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,722
Even as our entire race
grapples with the Dominion

67
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,994
there's no place
for an old man

68
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:45,634
with too many enemies
and not enough friends.

69
00:03:49,516 --> 00:03:51,884
That's why
I've come here tonight.

70
00:03:51,922 --> 00:03:54,085
It's not easy

71
00:03:54,126 --> 00:03:58,123
for me to beg you for help...

72
00:03:58,167 --> 00:04:01,298
but I have nowhere else to turn.

73
00:04:03,746 --> 00:04:06,650
Help me fight again, Worf.

74
00:04:06,684 --> 00:04:11,490
Help me end my life
as I've lived it...

75
00:04:11,527 --> 00:04:13,622
as a warrior.

76
00:04:20,044 --> 00:04:23,141
How many more reports
does the High Council require?

77
00:04:23,184 --> 00:04:25,518
As many as last time.

78
00:04:25,555 --> 00:04:28,356
And Starfleet is still
waiting for your signature

79
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:29,988
on these repair requests.

80
00:04:32,202 --> 00:04:34,604
There will come a day, Darok

81
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,740
when your services as my aide
will no longer be required.

82
00:04:38,782 --> 00:04:43,246
I look forward to that day
with great anticipation.

83
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,259
Until then...

84
00:04:45,863 --> 00:04:47,457
Ah, Worf!

85
00:04:47,532 --> 00:04:48,727
Good to see you.

86
00:04:48,768 --> 00:04:50,965
Thank you, Darok.

87
00:04:57,385 --> 00:05:01,485
It's a pity Captain Sisko
frowns on summary executions.

88
00:05:01,527 --> 00:05:03,724
What can I do for you?

89
00:05:03,764 --> 00:05:07,795
Kor, the <i>Dahar</i> Master
came to see me last night.

90
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,707
He has been unable
to find a command and I...

91
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:10,870
Tell me you're not going

92
00:05:10,913 --> 00:05:12,644
to ask me
to give that man a ship.

93
00:05:13,684 --> 00:05:14,652
Well, I had hoped...

94
00:05:14,686 --> 00:05:16,883
Then your hopes are in vain.

95
00:05:16,925 --> 00:05:19,795
That man is not welcome
in my House

96
00:05:19,831 --> 00:05:21,265
and I will certainly
not have him

97
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,791
commanding a ship in my fleet.

98
00:05:22,837 --> 00:05:25,809
General, Kor is a friend,
and I have already...

99
00:05:25,843 --> 00:05:26,811
Not another word!

100
00:05:26,845 --> 00:05:28,838
Do you hear?
Not one word!

101
00:05:31,587 --> 00:05:36,427
Now get out of here
before I forget we are brothers.

102
00:07:49,995 --> 00:07:52,158
I plan to attack
the Trelka V Starbase

103
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:54,727
then push deeper
into Cardassian territory.

104
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:57,036
I'll hit the Manora shipyards

105
00:07:57,076 --> 00:08:00,446
the Jem'Hadar breeding
facility on Sheva II

106
00:08:00,482 --> 00:08:03,454
the supply depots
in the Borias Cluster.

107
00:08:03,488 --> 00:08:04,922
It would take half
the Ninth Fleet

108
00:08:04,957 --> 00:08:06,756
just to destroy Trelka V.

109
00:08:06,828 --> 00:08:10,427
I don't intend to destroy
the base, just damage it...

110
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:12,029
throw them off-balance

111
00:08:12,072 --> 00:08:15,306
then move on
to the next target.

112
00:08:15,345 --> 00:08:18,784
Imagine... the chaos we'll cause

113
00:08:18,818 --> 00:08:21,254
once we're in
behind their lines.

114
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,656
A cavalry raid.

115
00:08:23,762 --> 00:08:26,393
Ancient Earth soldiers
mounted on horseback.

116
00:08:26,434 --> 00:08:28,666
They had the speed
to charge behind enemy lines

117
00:08:28,705 --> 00:08:29,798
to stir up trouble

118
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,368
and the mobility
to keep from being caught.

119
00:08:32,413 --> 00:08:34,906
How many ships will you take?

120
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,749
Five birds-of-prey.

121
00:08:36,788 --> 00:08:38,485
Battle cruisers are too slow

122
00:08:38,525 --> 00:08:40,290
too unwieldy
for a mission like this.

123
00:08:40,328 --> 00:08:42,798
Do you want to take the <i>Defiant?</i>

124
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,430
Perhaps the <i>Defiant</i>
should remain here

125
00:08:45,472 --> 00:08:51,178
just in case the Jem'Hadar try
their own "cavalry raid," hmm?

126
00:08:51,217 --> 00:08:54,018
But it may be prudent
for the <i>Defiant</i>

127
00:08:54,056 --> 00:08:56,424
and a dozen or so
other starships

128
00:08:56,461 --> 00:08:58,431
to be waiting for us
when we return.

129
00:08:58,465 --> 00:09:01,437
You mean you might be bringing
company back with you?

130
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:04,602
I'm sure you'll be
ready to welcome them.

131
00:09:04,643 --> 00:09:06,510
With phasers charged.

132
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,036
Our disruptor targeting sensors
need to be replaced

133
00:09:19,073 --> 00:09:21,043
as well as our
guidance system relays.

134
00:09:21,077 --> 00:09:23,513
Make a note of that
for Chief O'Brien.

135
00:09:23,548 --> 00:09:25,780
He should give the <i>Ch'Tang</i>
first priority.

136
00:09:26,954 --> 00:09:29,356
So, if you have something
to ask me, do it now

137
00:09:29,393 --> 00:09:31,556
before Darok buries me
under more paperwork.

138
00:09:33,368 --> 00:09:35,235
I wish to speak
with you about Kor.

139
00:09:35,272 --> 00:09:36,763
Now, I know you have
strong feelings about...

140
00:09:36,807 --> 00:09:39,073
Clear the Bridge!

141
00:09:52,606 --> 00:09:55,099
I did not expect
to hear anything

142
00:09:55,145 --> 00:09:57,377
further on this
subject from you.

143
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,682
And I did not expect
to be forbidden

144
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,747
to speak with you
on any subject.

145
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,125
Have I become a <i>shuVak</i>

146
00:10:04,163 --> 00:10:07,431
to be ordered about
like Darok?

147
00:10:08,905 --> 00:10:10,875
No.

148
00:10:10,909 --> 00:10:12,936
Of course not.

149
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,450
Very well.

150
00:10:15,485 --> 00:10:18,480
Talk and be done with it.

151
00:10:21,263 --> 00:10:26,935
Kor came to see me,
asking my help as a friend.

152
00:10:28,645 --> 00:10:31,242
He is an old man

153
00:10:31,283 --> 00:10:34,312
with no family and no influence
left in the Empire.

154
00:10:34,356 --> 00:10:37,851
He asked nothing
except for the chance

155
00:10:37,896 --> 00:10:40,128
to fight and die
as a Klingon warrior.

156
00:10:40,168 --> 00:10:42,138
I told him I would
speak with you

157
00:10:42,172 --> 00:10:44,574
about finding him
a command in the fleet.

158
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:50,248
I would not give that man
the gnawed bones of my last meal

159
00:10:50,288 --> 00:10:53,021
much less command of a ship.

160
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,358
But why?

161
00:10:54,396 --> 00:10:56,924
There is no blood feud
between our Houses

162
00:10:56,967 --> 00:10:59,233
and Kor has said
he has not even met you.

163
00:11:02,144 --> 00:11:07,246
You can wound a man
without ever seeing his face.

164
00:11:11,297 --> 00:11:14,531
When I was a boy,
my family still lived

165
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,004
in the lowlands
of Ketha Province.

166
00:11:16,106 --> 00:11:18,703
We had very little,
but it didn't matter.

167
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:21,376
We were a family of warriors.

168
00:11:21,417 --> 00:11:24,116
15 generations had served
as soldiers of the Empire

169
00:11:24,155 --> 00:11:28,459
but my father had
higher hopes for me.

170
00:11:28,498 --> 00:11:32,370
He wanted his son
to become an officer.

171
00:11:32,405 --> 00:11:34,875
It took a great deal of effort

172
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:39,146
but eventually, he found someone
willing to sponsor me.

173
00:11:39,185 --> 00:11:42,955
I passed my entrance exam
on my first attempt

174
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:45,361
and all that remained
was final approval

175
00:11:45,398 --> 00:11:48,802
by the Oversight Council...
a simple formality.

176
00:11:50,308 --> 00:11:52,973
My application was rejected

177
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:58,479
by one member
of that council... Kor.

178
00:11:59,793 --> 00:12:01,387
Why?

179
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,630
"Why?"

180
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:08,131
Kor's family descends
from the Imperial Court itself.

181
00:12:08,176 --> 00:12:09,405
Kor is "of the blood"...

182
00:12:09,446 --> 00:12:12,475
born to rule
by the divine will of Kahless

183
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:13,782
and what was I?

184
00:12:13,821 --> 00:12:16,884
A boy from the Ketha lowlands.

185
00:12:16,927 --> 00:12:18,487
He could not bear the thought

186
00:12:18,531 --> 00:12:22,528
of someone like me joining
the elite officer ranks

187
00:12:22,572 --> 00:12:25,042
and so, to my father's
embarrassment

188
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,013
and my everlasting shame...

189
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:30,486
my application was denied.

190
00:12:31,757 --> 00:12:33,351
And with the mark
of Kor on my record

191
00:12:33,394 --> 00:12:36,366
I could not join
even as a common soldier.

192
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,101
I spent five years
as a civilian laborer

193
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,076
aboard General
ShiVang's flagship.

194
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:47,281
Then... as fortune
would have it

195
00:12:47,322 --> 00:12:52,128
the Romulans made a foolhardy
attempt to board our ship.

196
00:12:52,231 --> 00:12:56,399
I earned
a battlefield commission.

197
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,640
Unfortunately...

198
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,384
my father did not live
to see that glorious day.

199
00:13:09,933 --> 00:13:12,199
And if Kor had had his way

200
00:13:12,237 --> 00:13:16,007
I would still be
a civilian on that ship

201
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,878
cleaning the officers' mess.

202
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,681
I understand

203
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,783
but I must tell you
that using my own authority

204
00:13:22,826 --> 00:13:25,627
I appointed Kor
an officer in the Ninth Fleet.

205
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:31,073
Made him an officer...
just like that.

206
00:13:31,109 --> 00:13:34,479
That's the difference
between his name and mine...

207
00:13:34,516 --> 00:13:38,820
his opens doors,
mine closes them.

208
00:13:38,858 --> 00:13:40,258
I did not anticipate...

209
00:13:40,293 --> 00:13:41,261
It's done!

210
00:13:41,295 --> 00:13:43,858
Your apology is not sought

211
00:13:43,901 --> 00:13:46,167
but know this, Worf...

212
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:50,179
Kor is your responsibility.

213
00:13:50,213 --> 00:13:53,208
I want nothing
to do with him.

214
00:13:58,931 --> 00:14:00,457
Do you...
do you remember

215
00:14:00,501 --> 00:14:03,098
breaking into
the Duke's harem on Renavi?

216
00:14:03,139 --> 00:14:05,302
Oh.

217
00:14:05,343 --> 00:14:07,472
How could I forget that?

218
00:14:07,515 --> 00:14:10,078
That is one of Curzon's
favorite memories.

219
00:14:12,324 --> 00:14:14,260
Hi.

220
00:14:16,265 --> 00:14:17,164
Hello.

221
00:14:17,267 --> 00:14:19,533
Come and join us, my friend.

222
00:14:19,573 --> 00:14:22,739
Uh... I am on duty.

223
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,272
I'll see you later.

224
00:14:25,317 --> 00:14:26,307
Mmm.

225
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:30,355
It's good to see you again, Kor.

226
00:14:30,394 --> 00:14:31,828
Mm-hmm.

227
00:14:33,834 --> 00:14:36,863
Still the same old Dax...

228
00:14:36,907 --> 00:14:38,570
and yet not.

229
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:40,843
General Martok will not
give you a command.

230
00:14:40,882 --> 00:14:43,718
Uh... <i>kesh!</i>

231
00:14:43,754 --> 00:14:45,052
He says that

232
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,219
you struck his name
from an officers list

233
00:14:47,327 --> 00:14:50,322
because his family comes
from the Ketha lowlands.

234
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,858
Did I?

235
00:14:53,306 --> 00:14:55,208
I don't recall.

236
00:14:55,243 --> 00:14:58,647
Of course, there were
so many officer lists.

237
00:14:58,684 --> 00:15:00,347
I suppose it's possible.

238
00:15:00,387 --> 00:15:04,191
It is an unworthy reason to bar
a man from serving the Empire.

239
00:15:05,998 --> 00:15:07,296
Worf, you've been living

240
00:15:07,334 --> 00:15:11,138
among this democratic rabble
for too long.

241
00:15:11,175 --> 00:15:12,609
I know your bloodline.

242
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:16,015
We both come from noble Houses.

243
00:15:16,052 --> 00:15:19,422
Among our people,
that still counts for something.

244
00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:22,226
If Martok is a true Klingon,
he should appreciate that.

245
00:15:22,331 --> 00:15:23,356
He does not.

246
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,773
Did he revoke my commission?

247
00:15:29,813 --> 00:15:32,113
No. You will serve
aboard the <i>Ch'Tang...</i>

248
00:15:33,454 --> 00:15:34,980
as Third Officer.

249
00:15:35,023 --> 00:15:37,118
Third?!

250
00:15:40,735 --> 00:15:42,864
Oh, well... huh, no matter.

251
00:15:42,905 --> 00:15:46,275
I've overcome greater obstacles.

252
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:49,113
Thank you, Worf.
You're a true friend.

253
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,024
You will report aboard at 0700

254
00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:56,259
and stay out of Martok's way.

255
00:15:56,299 --> 00:15:59,830
He will not even know
I am there.

256
00:16:03,012 --> 00:16:04,241
Worf!

257
00:16:04,348 --> 00:16:06,876
Uh... what was the
name of that ship?

258
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,480
Oh, the <i>Ch'Tang.</i>

259
00:16:08,524 --> 00:16:10,391
<i>Ch'Tang!</i> Of course.

260
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,793
I'll see you there.

261
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:27,791
All decks report ready.

262
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:28,888
Defense systems on-line.

263
00:16:28,931 --> 00:16:30,058
Engine room standing by.

264
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,831
Transporter room reports
that our last crew members

265
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:32,838
have beamed aboard.

266
00:16:32,872 --> 00:16:33,840
Very well.

267
00:16:33,874 --> 00:16:34,842
Signal the squadron.

268
00:16:34,876 --> 00:16:36,310
Prepare to get under way.

269
00:16:36,345 --> 00:16:37,836
Stand by to cloak.

270
00:16:37,882 --> 00:16:38,872
Aye, sir.

271
00:16:38,917 --> 00:16:43,723
Helm, set course 325 mark 003.

272
00:16:43,761 --> 00:16:45,560
Full impulse till we
clear the outer marker.

273
00:16:45,598 --> 00:16:47,329
Then go to...

274
00:16:49,505 --> 00:16:53,036
Third Officer Kor
reporting for duty.

275
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:54,639
The <i>Dahar</i> Master.

276
00:16:56,987 --> 00:16:59,116
Take your station.

277
00:17:10,884 --> 00:17:13,047
Return to your duties

278
00:17:13,088 --> 00:17:15,320
or I will find a crew that can.

279
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,820
Helmsman, I gave you
an order.

280
00:17:18,867 --> 00:17:20,427
<i>ChaH-Veh!</i>

281
00:17:29,487 --> 00:17:31,389
Kor...

282
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:34,397
here on our ship.

283
00:17:36,603 --> 00:17:38,903
Don't you have
something to do?

284
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,536
No.

285
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:43,640
Then find something!

286
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,802
It's an honor to have you
aboard with us.

287
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:57,504
Ah, thank you very much.

288
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:59,740
Welcome, <i>Dahar</i> Master.

289
00:18:11,104 --> 00:18:13,040
So what did Kor say
when he met you?

290
00:18:13,075 --> 00:18:15,409
The usual.

291
00:18:15,446 --> 00:18:18,941
I have the same conversation
over and over again.

292
00:18:18,987 --> 00:18:20,854
Everyone's shocked at first.

293
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,861
Then they start
scanning my face

294
00:18:22,895 --> 00:18:25,799
for signs of the person
they knew as Dax.

295
00:18:25,834 --> 00:18:27,531
"It can't be.

296
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,472
"Is it really you?

297
00:18:29,507 --> 00:18:32,377
"Oh, I do see
a little Jadzia in the eyes

298
00:18:32,413 --> 00:18:34,815
a little Curzon in the smile."

299
00:18:34,852 --> 00:18:36,981
Isn't there a period
of adjustment

300
00:18:37,056 --> 00:18:38,992
that joined Trills
have to go through

301
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,620
where people
are comparing them

302
00:18:40,664 --> 00:18:41,632
to previous hosts?

303
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,863
I'm, I'm sure it'll pass.

304
00:18:46,441 --> 00:18:47,773
You're right.

305
00:18:47,811 --> 00:18:50,008
The last five Dax hosts
went through this.

306
00:18:50,082 --> 00:18:51,072
Ah.

307
00:18:53,222 --> 00:18:54,748
That wasn't bad.

308
00:18:54,792 --> 00:18:56,591
You'd make
a pretty good Counselor.

309
00:18:56,628 --> 00:18:57,857
You want to trade jobs?

310
00:18:57,898 --> 00:19:00,495
Oh, yeah... people would love
bringing their problems to me.

311
00:19:00,536 --> 00:19:01,970
"You dreamt about what?

312
00:19:02,006 --> 00:19:02,974
"You're crazy.

313
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:04,534
"Now get out of my office.

314
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:06,240
Next patient."

315
00:19:07,851 --> 00:19:09,980
It's funny you should
mention dreams.

316
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:12,993
Ever since
my conversation with Kor

317
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:15,659
I have had the most
intense dreams about him.

318
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,861
Like what?

319
00:19:16,903 --> 00:19:18,998
Being on a Klingon
Bridge together...

320
00:19:19,107 --> 00:19:20,598
going off into battle...

321
00:19:20,643 --> 00:19:22,169
drinking bloodwine...

322
00:19:22,213 --> 00:19:23,773
which still makes me gag

323
00:19:23,817 --> 00:19:25,115
by the way.

324
00:19:25,152 --> 00:19:26,815
Singing songs...

325
00:19:26,856 --> 00:19:29,760
A part of me wants to be
out there with him now.

326
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:31,697
I hope he's all right.

327
00:19:31,732 --> 00:19:33,759
I mean, I know I'm sort
of contradicting

328
00:19:33,803 --> 00:19:35,329
what I just said
about wanting

329
00:19:35,372 --> 00:19:37,604
to set myself apart
from my previous hosts

330
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:41,310
but the memories I have
of being with him

331
00:19:41,351 --> 00:19:42,410
are so vivid.

332
00:19:42,453 --> 00:19:44,389
I can't bear the
thought of losing him.

333
00:19:44,424 --> 00:19:47,294
I'd give almost anything
for the chance to...

334
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,766
be together just one more time...

335
00:19:49,802 --> 00:19:53,333
the two of us side by side,
just like it used to be.

336
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,244
Do you need something?

337
00:20:01,424 --> 00:20:02,585
No.

338
00:20:05,065 --> 00:20:06,694
Nothing.

339
00:20:11,746 --> 00:20:15,311
So, what's your
professional opinion?

340
00:20:15,352 --> 00:20:17,949
Mmm... you're crazy.

341
00:20:17,991 --> 00:20:20,052
Next patient.

342
00:20:25,105 --> 00:20:26,768
What's the matter with you?

343
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,711
Someone forget to leave a tip?

344
00:20:31,451 --> 00:20:32,919
It's Ezri.

345
00:20:32,955 --> 00:20:34,253
She... she...

346
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:35,588
I can't even say it.

347
00:20:35,626 --> 00:20:36,992
Try.

348
00:20:38,632 --> 00:20:41,502
She wants to get back
together with Worf.

349
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:47,177
And before the Cardassians
ever knew we were there

350
00:20:47,216 --> 00:20:50,518
we destroyed the entire camp
and the relay station.

351
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:54,390
To General Martok...
victor of Felton Prime.

352
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:57,125
<i>Qapla'!</i>

353
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,771
Let me have the honor
to welcome the <i>Dahar</i> Master

354
00:21:02,814 --> 00:21:05,148
to the humble mess hall
of the <i>Ch'Tang.</i>

355
00:21:05,185 --> 00:21:06,153
Oh, sit, sit.

356
00:21:06,187 --> 00:21:07,986
You do me too much honor.

357
00:21:08,025 --> 00:21:11,156
On this voyage,
I am but the Third Officer.

358
00:21:11,197 --> 00:21:13,463
I expect no special treatment.

359
00:21:13,502 --> 00:21:16,099
May I serve you <i>gagh,</i>
<i>Dahar</i> Master?

360
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:19,011
Have you settled on
an attack plan

361
00:21:19,047 --> 00:21:20,676
for the starbase on Trelka V?

362
00:21:23,355 --> 00:21:25,689
I'm going to send
the <i>Malpara</i> and the <i>Ning'tao</i>

363
00:21:25,726 --> 00:21:27,160
in ahead of the rest
of the squadron.

364
00:21:27,196 --> 00:21:28,164
They'll make

365
00:21:28,198 --> 00:21:29,827
a single strafing run
of the base

366
00:21:29,868 --> 00:21:31,735
then head out of the system.

367
00:21:31,771 --> 00:21:33,673
When the enemy sends out
their repair crews

368
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,806
to assess the damage,
then the rest

369
00:21:36,849 --> 00:21:38,876
of the squadron will de-cloak.

370
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,721
With any luck, we'll catch
them not only unprepared

371
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:45,128
but with their entire damage
control effort under way.

372
00:21:45,165 --> 00:21:46,190
Excellent.

373
00:21:46,234 --> 00:21:48,704
An excellent plan, General.

374
00:21:48,739 --> 00:21:50,402
I'm glad you approve.

375
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:51,410
Of course.

376
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:53,243
It's the same tactic
Kang and I used

377
00:21:53,348 --> 00:21:56,047
against the Federation
in the Battle of Caleb IV.

378
00:21:56,087 --> 00:21:57,613
You were at Caleb IV?

379
00:21:57,656 --> 00:21:59,353
Of course he was.

380
00:21:59,394 --> 00:22:01,193
Forgive the ignorance
of these children.

381
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,199
I was a young officer once.

382
00:22:04,237 --> 00:22:06,936
I know how irrelevant
the past can seem.

383
00:22:06,976 --> 00:22:07,944
We would be honored

384
00:22:07,978 --> 00:22:09,378
if you would tell us
about Caleb IV.

385
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:11,384
Tell the tale.

386
00:22:11,418 --> 00:22:12,443
Tell us.

387
00:22:12,486 --> 00:22:14,854
Well, there's not much
to tell, really.

388
00:22:14,892 --> 00:22:16,224
The battle was over

389
00:22:16,327 --> 00:22:19,231
almost before the Federation
knew it had begun.

390
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,899
I commanded the First Division
from the <i>Klothos...</i>

391
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:25,434
one of the old D-5 cruisers.

392
00:22:25,479 --> 00:22:27,711
Kang commanded
the Second Division.

393
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:31,245
Now, you must remember
that in those days

394
00:22:31,324 --> 00:22:35,424
the cloaking device was
a new piece of technology.

395
00:22:36,468 --> 00:22:38,404
There were only
a handful of engineers

396
00:22:38,438 --> 00:22:41,137
in the Imperial Fleet
who knew how to operate them.

397
00:22:41,177 --> 00:22:43,147
Before we left Chronos

398
00:22:43,181 --> 00:22:45,276
I spent three days
in the Engine Room

399
00:22:45,385 --> 00:22:48,357
taking the device apart
with my bare hands...

400
00:22:49,861 --> 00:22:51,797
and then putting it
back together again.

401
00:22:51,831 --> 00:22:53,265
Now, this would come in handy

402
00:22:53,301 --> 00:22:56,000
later in the battle,
as you'll see.

403
00:22:57,878 --> 00:22:59,609
It is not the fault
of the crew.

404
00:22:59,647 --> 00:23:01,115
They are not used to serving

405
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:03,620
with a legendary figure
like Kor.

406
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,692
Bridge to General Martok.

407
00:23:06,728 --> 00:23:08,595
Yes.

408
00:23:08,632 --> 00:23:10,261
We are approaching Trelka V.

409
00:23:10,335 --> 00:23:12,669
Set defense condition one.

410
00:23:13,742 --> 00:23:15,176
Defense condition one.

411
00:23:15,212 --> 00:23:17,114
All hands to battle stations.

412
00:23:17,149 --> 00:23:20,087
Repeat, all hands
to battle stations.

413
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:33,646
I'm supposed to be somewhere.

414
00:23:33,682 --> 00:23:35,116
<i>Dahar</i> Master?

415
00:23:35,152 --> 00:23:36,815
Where are you going,
Lieutenant?

416
00:23:36,854 --> 00:23:37,822
To, to the Bridge.

417
00:23:37,856 --> 00:23:39,324
We're approaching Trelka V.

418
00:23:39,427 --> 00:23:41,260
The Bridge!

419
00:23:41,297 --> 00:23:42,492
Are you all right?

420
00:23:42,533 --> 00:23:43,762
Of course.

421
00:23:43,802 --> 00:23:45,465
What are you waiting for?

422
00:23:45,505 --> 00:23:46,837
Report to your station.

423
00:23:46,874 --> 00:23:47,864
<i>ChaH-Veh!</i>

424
00:23:49,547 --> 00:23:51,346
Concentrate!

425
00:24:08,685 --> 00:24:10,746
Their shields are
down to 65 percent.

426
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:12,759
Three Cardassian cruisers
are in spacedock

427
00:24:12,793 --> 00:24:14,558
orbiting on the far
side of the planet.

428
00:24:14,597 --> 00:24:15,997
Two of them are
getting under way.

429
00:24:17,002 --> 00:24:18,163
The <i>Malpara</i> and the <i>Ning'tao</i>

430
00:24:18,204 --> 00:24:19,502
have completed their attack.

431
00:24:33,068 --> 00:24:35,631
The <i>Malpara</i> is gone...

432
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,675
No survivors.

433
00:24:38,712 --> 00:24:40,875
The <i>Ning'tao</i> is heading
out of the system.

434
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:42,316
The Cardassians are pursuing.

435
00:24:42,352 --> 00:24:45,256
And leaving their base
unprotected.

436
00:24:45,292 --> 00:24:46,521
Helm, take us in.

437
00:24:46,561 --> 00:24:49,397
Bring us to a hover
300 meters above the base.

438
00:24:49,433 --> 00:24:52,633
Stand by to de-cloak
on my command.

439
00:24:52,673 --> 00:24:54,802
Holding at 300 meters.

440
00:24:54,844 --> 00:24:56,039
Scan the base.

441
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,107
They've dispatched
damage control teams.

442
00:24:58,151 --> 00:24:59,950
Two defense batteries are out.

443
00:25:01,057 --> 00:25:03,357
And they've just dropped
their primary shield grid.

444
00:25:03,428 --> 00:25:05,364
De-cloak the ship

445
00:25:05,398 --> 00:25:07,095
and open fire.

446
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:24,599
Shields are down to 85 percent.

447
00:25:25,739 --> 00:25:28,404
Reroute emergency power
to secondary shield emitters.

448
00:25:28,478 --> 00:25:30,607
Fire torpedoes!

449
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:34,516
Helm, lay in an escape course.

450
00:25:35,592 --> 00:25:37,221
Aye, sir.

451
00:25:48,117 --> 00:25:49,210
Continue firing.

452
00:25:49,253 --> 00:25:51,155
Target their primary reactors.

453
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,249
<i>ChaH-Veh.</i>

454
00:25:52,292 --> 00:25:54,023
And bring us around
for another pass.

455
00:25:54,063 --> 00:25:54,962
Coming about.

456
00:25:54,997 --> 00:25:57,490
No... only one pass.

457
00:26:05,285 --> 00:26:07,221
Leave the system.

458
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,321
Do not worry, my friend.

459
00:26:11,364 --> 00:26:12,389
All is well.

460
00:26:12,432 --> 00:26:14,732
You old... fool!

461
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,706
The <i>Orantho</i> reports

462
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,438
their Captain
and First Officer are dead.

463
00:26:18,511 --> 00:26:20,105
They have a hull breach
in their port quarter.

464
00:26:20,148 --> 00:26:22,243
Instruct them to continue firing

465
00:26:22,286 --> 00:26:24,483
and open a channel to Kang.

466
00:26:25,492 --> 00:26:26,460
To Kang?

467
00:26:26,494 --> 00:26:28,293
Tell him we've succeeded

468
00:26:28,331 --> 00:26:31,269
and that the Federation
outpost on Caleb IV

469
00:26:31,304 --> 00:26:33,638
will be taken within an hour.

470
00:26:35,645 --> 00:26:37,706
Sir, Kang has been dead
for years.

471
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,388
Prepare a boarding party.

472
00:26:41,424 --> 00:26:43,189
We're going to take the base.

473
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:45,322
But, sir, they have
a garrison of 10,000.

474
00:26:45,365 --> 00:26:49,032
By the hand of Kahless,
get us out of here!

475
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:51,943
Victory is ours.

476
00:26:51,978 --> 00:26:54,346
The Federation
will rue the day

477
00:26:54,383 --> 00:26:58,187
they dared to challenge
the might of the Klingon Empire.

478
00:26:58,224 --> 00:27:00,821
We will take Caleb IV

479
00:27:00,862 --> 00:27:04,572
and raise our banner
over the smoking ruins

480
00:27:04,705 --> 00:27:05,673
of their outpost.

481
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:13,853
Escape course, now!

482
00:27:20,537 --> 00:27:22,905
Engage cloaks.

483
00:27:27,351 --> 00:27:29,821
<i>Orantho</i> and <i>Slivin</i>
have cloaked.

484
00:27:29,855 --> 00:27:32,018
No pursuit from Trelka V.

485
00:27:32,126 --> 00:27:34,187
No time to waste.

486
00:27:34,231 --> 00:27:37,294
Proceed... proceed
to the rendezvous

487
00:27:37,337 --> 00:27:38,863
and then on
to the Manora shipyards.

488
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,570
Warp 7.

489
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:41,976
Medical team to the Bridge.

490
00:27:42,013 --> 00:27:46,477
Worf, get that man out of here.

491
00:28:26,235 --> 00:28:28,501
Hi. I think
I'm in the mood for a...

492
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,769
Wait.

493
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:31,574
I have something to say.

494
00:28:32,714 --> 00:28:36,586
Now, you may think
this is none of my business

495
00:28:36,622 --> 00:28:38,090
but someone has to speak up

496
00:28:38,158 --> 00:28:40,185
and I've decided
that someone is me.

497
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:42,723
So, here it is.
I'll just say it.

498
00:28:42,768 --> 00:28:44,465
Okay.

499
00:28:52,487 --> 00:28:53,887
You're making a mistake

500
00:28:53,923 --> 00:28:56,520
by pursuing another
relationship with Worf.

501
00:28:56,562 --> 00:28:58,088
Excuse me?

502
00:28:58,131 --> 00:28:59,099
You heard me.

503
00:28:59,133 --> 00:29:01,330
I know how Jadzia
felt about Worf

504
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:03,501
but that was her life,
not yours.

505
00:29:03,543 --> 00:29:05,274
You're Ezri Dax.

506
00:29:05,313 --> 00:29:06,713
You need to give yourself

507
00:29:06,749 --> 00:29:09,585
a chance to explore
other relationships.

508
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:12,753
You're young... and beautiful

509
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:14,730
and full of life.

510
00:29:14,765 --> 00:29:18,067
Why go after a man
who's only a memory to you?

511
00:29:18,105 --> 00:29:20,473
I've had my problems
with Worf, I'll admit that

512
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,104
but this is not about
me or my feelings.

513
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:24,012
This is about you.

514
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:28,890
Worf has done nothing,
and I mean nothing

515
00:29:28,927 --> 00:29:30,225
to deserve you.

516
00:29:32,367 --> 00:29:33,699
Shouldn't you try
and find someone

517
00:29:33,736 --> 00:29:38,371
who's willing to win your heart
not just inherit it?

518
00:29:38,413 --> 00:29:40,906
You deserve better.

519
00:29:40,951 --> 00:29:43,114
There.
I've said my piece.

520
00:29:46,295 --> 00:29:48,527
Can I say something now?

521
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:54,003
I'm not interested in having
another relationship with Worf.

522
00:29:54,043 --> 00:29:55,706
I care about him

523
00:29:55,747 --> 00:29:58,844
and I probably always will,
but he's moved on with his life

524
00:29:58,886 --> 00:30:00,013
and so have I.

525
00:30:00,055 --> 00:30:01,922
Oh. Well, good.

526
00:30:02,961 --> 00:30:05,933
And I'd also like to say
that what you just did

527
00:30:05,967 --> 00:30:09,064
was one of the kindest,
dearest, and for you

528
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:11,202
one of the most
embarrassing things

529
00:30:11,244 --> 00:30:12,337
that I have ever heard.

530
00:30:18,526 --> 00:30:20,325
You're a real sweetheart.

531
00:30:23,403 --> 00:30:24,871
Can I order now?

532
00:30:24,905 --> 00:30:26,066
Mm-hmm.

533
00:30:26,107 --> 00:30:27,940
A Moscow mule.

534
00:30:27,978 --> 00:30:29,412
Coming right up.

535
00:30:37,364 --> 00:30:38,662
Did you hear that?

536
00:30:38,699 --> 00:30:40,726
She called me "sweetheart."

537
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,068
Yeah? So?

538
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:44,133
She loves me.

539
00:30:44,177 --> 00:30:45,976
What?

540
00:30:47,016 --> 00:30:48,245
"Sweetheart."

541
00:30:49,455 --> 00:30:52,291
You're certifiable,
you do realize that?

542
00:30:52,394 --> 00:30:54,193
She loves me.

543
00:30:56,969 --> 00:30:58,734
Find out what's wrong
with the <i>Ning'tao.</i>

544
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,606
I know Captain Lurkan is young

545
00:31:00,643 --> 00:31:02,738
but he must realize
the importance...

546
00:31:06,922 --> 00:31:09,017
the importance
of keeping formation.

547
00:31:11,398 --> 00:31:14,393
I've been thinking
about our next objective.

548
00:31:14,438 --> 00:31:16,670
Perhaps we should
go after a bigger target

549
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:18,645
something more threatening
to our forces.

550
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:22,346
Now, what about the base
on Caleb IV?

551
00:31:23,456 --> 00:31:26,519
If you'll excuse me,
I have duties to attend to.

552
00:31:26,562 --> 00:31:28,896
Your duties are right here.

553
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:35,975
Someone was just telling me

554
00:31:36,014 --> 00:31:38,041
about the defenses
on Caleb IV.

555
00:31:38,084 --> 00:31:39,313
Who was that?

556
00:31:39,421 --> 00:31:42,757
I believe it was
our Third Officer, General.

557
00:31:42,794 --> 00:31:45,766
That's right.
Third Officer.

558
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,861
Tell us about Caleb IV.

559
00:31:47,904 --> 00:31:51,104
Is it manned by Jem'Hadar
or Cardassian troops?

560
00:31:51,144 --> 00:31:52,807
I thought it was
a Federation outpost.

561
00:31:52,847 --> 00:31:54,817
How can that be?

562
00:31:54,851 --> 00:31:56,718
The Federation is our ally.

563
00:31:56,755 --> 00:31:59,123
Surely Kor is aware of that.

564
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,289
Perhaps he's confused.

565
00:32:01,331 --> 00:32:04,303
Confused? The <i>Dahar</i> Master?

566
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:05,497
Surely not.

567
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,976
We must be the ones
who are confused.

568
00:32:08,011 --> 00:32:09,640
Enlighten us.

569
00:32:09,681 --> 00:32:11,981
Who mans the base on Caleb IV...

570
00:32:12,019 --> 00:32:14,650
Dominion or Federation?

571
00:32:15,893 --> 00:32:17,795
I think he's forgotten.

572
00:32:17,831 --> 00:32:19,322
I think he's asleep.

573
00:32:19,433 --> 00:32:20,594
Stop it!

574
00:32:20,637 --> 00:32:21,730
Both of you.

575
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:25,841
Don't you have any respect

576
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,216
for one of the greatest
heroes of the Empire?

577
00:32:30,222 --> 00:32:32,089
He's thinking it over.

578
00:32:32,126 --> 00:32:34,255
Give him time.

579
00:32:36,067 --> 00:32:42,012
The last son of the House
of Kor should not be rushed.

580
00:32:42,046 --> 00:32:45,177
How long should we wait?

581
00:32:45,218 --> 00:32:47,154
Perhaps we should ask Kang!

582
00:32:56,775 --> 00:32:58,938
Well, say something, old man

583
00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:02,749
or have you lost your tongue
as well as your mind?

584
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:13,968
Savor the fruit of life,
my young friends.

585
00:33:14,009 --> 00:33:18,542
It has a sweet taste
when it is fresh from the vine

586
00:33:18,586 --> 00:33:21,558
but don't live too long.

587
00:33:21,592 --> 00:33:24,996
The taste turns bitter...

588
00:33:26,267 --> 00:33:29,262
after a time.

589
00:33:46,207 --> 00:33:47,870
The new personnel roster.

590
00:33:53,254 --> 00:33:55,747
You've removed Kor
from active duty.

591
00:33:55,793 --> 00:33:57,820
I saw no other choice.

592
00:33:57,864 --> 00:33:59,162
Still, you're his friend.

593
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,102
It must have been
difficult for you.

594
00:34:01,137 --> 00:34:02,766
A friend would not have put him

595
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:04,800
in that position
in the first place.

596
00:34:07,584 --> 00:34:11,285
I've hated his name
for almost 30 years.

597
00:34:11,324 --> 00:34:14,728
I've dreamt of the moment
when I would finally see him

598
00:34:14,764 --> 00:34:16,529
stripped of his rank and title

599
00:34:16,568 --> 00:34:18,367
when he would
suddenly find himself

600
00:34:18,404 --> 00:34:19,930
without a friend in the world

601
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:22,674
without the power
of his birthright.

602
00:34:24,483 --> 00:34:27,148
Well, I've had that moment now.

603
00:34:29,928 --> 00:34:32,296
And I took no joy from it.

604
00:34:34,938 --> 00:34:36,464
Have you thought about
what will become of him

605
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:39,445
when we return to Deep Space 9?

606
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,609
I plan to speak
with Chancellor Gowron

607
00:34:41,652 --> 00:34:46,959
to try and find Kor some
assignment on the Homeworld.

608
00:34:48,131 --> 00:34:50,762
I'll have a word
with Gowron as well.

609
00:34:50,803 --> 00:34:53,103
Bridge to General Martok.

610
00:34:53,141 --> 00:34:54,336
Yes?

611
00:34:54,376 --> 00:34:55,936
Pardon the interruption, sir.

612
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:59,511
Our sensors have detected
a large body of enemy ships.

613
00:34:59,621 --> 00:35:00,953
On my way.

614
00:35:03,629 --> 00:35:04,961
Where are they?

615
00:35:04,998 --> 00:35:07,298
Their warp signatures
are bearing directly astern.

616
00:35:07,336 --> 00:35:08,999
They're Jem'Hadar fighters

617
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:10,838
and they appear
to be pursuing us.

618
00:35:10,876 --> 00:35:12,344
How can that be?

619
00:35:12,379 --> 00:35:15,249
The lead ship is using some sort
of long-range tachyon scanner

620
00:35:15,285 --> 00:35:16,480
to penetrate our cloaks.

621
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,649
Does the Dominion possess
such a device?

622
00:35:18,692 --> 00:35:19,955
They do now.

623
00:35:19,995 --> 00:35:21,224
How many ships?

624
00:35:21,263 --> 00:35:23,130
I've identified
ten vessels so far.

625
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,633
And they're gaining on us.

626
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:37,525
How long before we are
within their weapons' range?

627
00:35:37,629 --> 00:35:39,462
Two hours, 12 minutes.

628
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,472
Helm... have you located
the <i>Defiant?</i>

629
00:35:42,506 --> 00:35:44,135
Yes, sir.
They're waiting for us

630
00:35:44,176 --> 00:35:47,205
in the Kalandra Sector with
seven Federation starships.

631
00:35:47,249 --> 00:35:48,342
It will take us...

632
00:35:48,384 --> 00:35:51,117
three hours, 45 minutes
to reach them.

633
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:53,388
If the Jem'Hadar could be forced

634
00:35:53,428 --> 00:35:55,864
to drop out of warp
for only ten minutes

635
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,893
they would not have time
to catch up with us

636
00:35:57,937 --> 00:35:59,702
before we rendezvous
with the <i>Defiant.</i>

637
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:02,713
It's a fine theory,
but how do we execute it?

638
00:36:03,916 --> 00:36:05,384
We could disrupt
their warp fields

639
00:36:05,418 --> 00:36:07,854
with an inverse graviton burst.

640
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:09,723
It would force them
to drop to impulse

641
00:36:09,761 --> 00:36:11,526
until the gravitons dissipated.

642
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,224
We would need to generate
a massive burst

643
00:36:13,267 --> 00:36:15,362
to disrupt the warp fields
of a fleet that size.

644
00:36:15,405 --> 00:36:17,739
A single bird-of-prey
could do it by diverting

645
00:36:17,777 --> 00:36:19,371
warp power
to the main deflector.

646
00:36:19,413 --> 00:36:20,540
How long would that delay them?

647
00:36:20,582 --> 00:36:22,848
They could
reinitialize their warp cores

648
00:36:22,887 --> 00:36:23,980
in less than two minutes.

649
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:28,892
If I could engage them in battle
while they are still at impulse

650
00:36:28,932 --> 00:36:31,300
that would delay
them even longer.

651
00:36:31,337 --> 00:36:33,273
I know I could do it.

652
00:36:33,307 --> 00:36:35,436
What do you mean,
you could do it?

653
00:36:35,478 --> 00:36:38,006
The <i>Orantho's</i> Captain
and First Officer are dead

654
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:40,282
and the <i>Slivin's</i>
deflector is damaged

655
00:36:40,321 --> 00:36:42,689
and cannot generate
a graviton burst...

656
00:36:42,727 --> 00:36:46,360
and the <i>Ning'tao's</i> Captain
is too young and inexperienced.

657
00:36:47,435 --> 00:36:49,371
I am the logical choice.

658
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:53,343
But Worf...

659
00:36:53,381 --> 00:36:55,715
this means that
you'd be sacrificing

660
00:36:55,753 --> 00:36:59,955
the... entire crew
of the <i>Ning'tao.</i>

661
00:36:59,994 --> 00:37:02,557
I have thought about that.

662
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:04,762
We could beam
most of the crew over

663
00:37:04,804 --> 00:37:06,238
before I take command.

664
00:37:06,273 --> 00:37:09,404
I would only need
six volunteers.

665
00:37:18,932 --> 00:37:21,368
Signal the <i>Ning'tao.</i>

666
00:37:21,403 --> 00:37:24,432
Tell them to prepare
for a change in command.

667
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,908
Yes?

668
00:37:33,248 --> 00:37:35,047
I'm not hungry.

669
00:37:35,085 --> 00:37:37,112
The food is for me.

670
00:37:37,156 --> 00:37:39,821
I haven't eaten in hours.

671
00:37:39,862 --> 00:37:41,559
Men of our generation

672
00:37:41,598 --> 00:37:43,898
never stood on ceremony, huh?

673
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:46,906
We ate when we were hungry.

674
00:37:46,943 --> 00:37:49,209
We fought when we were angered.

675
00:37:49,247 --> 00:37:55,089
Oh... I miss the simplicity
of those days.

676
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:57,961
I miss a great deal
about those days.

677
00:37:57,998 --> 00:38:00,434
The warriors on this ship...

678
00:38:00,469 --> 00:38:03,134
they don't know
what they've missed

679
00:38:03,175 --> 00:38:05,772
but such is the way
with children.

680
00:38:05,814 --> 00:38:07,043
Hmm?

681
00:38:07,083 --> 00:38:09,748
They often let the
promise of the future

682
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,623
obscure the glories
of the past.

683
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:16,030
Is there a point
to this nostalgic indulgence?

684
00:38:16,067 --> 00:38:19,562
Only that they are children.

685
00:38:19,607 --> 00:38:24,447
Even Martok, who, for all
his flaws, is a great man

686
00:38:24,484 --> 00:38:29,825
even Martok is but a child
compared to you or me.

687
00:38:29,862 --> 00:38:33,825
They are quick to judge,
but slow to forgive.

688
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:36,933
They still have much to learn.

689
00:38:40,316 --> 00:38:44,256
We are being pursued
by a Jem'Hadar fleet.

690
00:38:45,693 --> 00:38:50,294
Worf believes he can stop them
with a single ship.

691
00:38:50,336 --> 00:38:51,531
How?

692
00:38:54,043 --> 00:38:55,842
It's a good plan...

693
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,613
but it has one flaw.

694
00:38:58,652 --> 00:39:01,488
It depends entirely
on Worf successfully

695
00:39:01,524 --> 00:39:04,257
engaging the whole enemy fleet

696
00:39:04,297 --> 00:39:07,360
if only for a short time.

697
00:39:10,142 --> 00:39:11,873
It can be done.

698
00:39:11,912 --> 00:39:14,314
The key is to confuse
their sensors

699
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:18,985
in the opening moments...
with a spread of torpedoes.

700
00:39:19,026 --> 00:39:20,255
Perhaps.

701
00:39:21,664 --> 00:39:25,434
But it would take a man
with three times his experience

702
00:39:25,472 --> 00:39:27,704
to accomplish such a feat

703
00:39:27,743 --> 00:39:34,086
and such a man... would have
to be certain of his abilities.

704
00:39:34,123 --> 00:39:37,618
Such a man
would not take the job...

705
00:39:39,233 --> 00:39:41,966
unless he were certain.

706
00:39:47,616 --> 00:39:52,684
It has been an honor serving
with you, Kor, son of Rynar.

707
00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:09,323
Worf!

708
00:40:12,433 --> 00:40:15,735
Leaving for the <i>Ning'tao,</i>
I take it?

709
00:40:15,772 --> 00:40:16,899
Yes.

710
00:40:16,942 --> 00:40:18,605
I wanted to wish you well.

711
00:40:18,712 --> 00:40:23,016
I look forward to seeing you
at the gates to <i>Sto-Vo-Kor.</i>

712
00:40:24,524 --> 00:40:26,426
As do I.

713
00:40:26,461 --> 00:40:27,895
Do you have any message

714
00:40:27,931 --> 00:40:30,494
you want me to convey
to Jadzia?

715
00:40:35,345 --> 00:40:37,942
When I reach the Halls
of the Hallowed Dead

716
00:40:37,984 --> 00:40:40,079
I will find your beloved

717
00:40:40,122 --> 00:40:43,653
and remind her that her husband
is a noble warrior

718
00:40:43,762 --> 00:40:47,759
and that he still loves
no one but her.

719
00:40:47,803 --> 00:40:50,832
Good-bye, my friend.

720
00:40:50,876 --> 00:40:52,470
Live well.

721
00:41:03,368 --> 00:41:05,361
Long live the Empire.

722
00:41:26,748 --> 00:41:28,445
On the Bridge?

723
00:41:28,485 --> 00:41:31,821
If they succeed, you can
drink to their courage...

724
00:41:31,858 --> 00:41:33,326
and if they fail

725
00:41:33,361 --> 00:41:35,854
you can still drink
to their courage.

726
00:41:35,899 --> 00:41:38,335
The <i>Ning'tao</i>
is closing on the enemy.

727
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:41,002
She's initiated
the graviton burst.

728
00:41:41,044 --> 00:41:44,175
Their warp fields
are destabilizing.

729
00:41:44,216 --> 00:41:46,413
They're dropping to impulse.

730
00:41:46,454 --> 00:41:47,888
By Kahless' hand... how many?

731
00:41:48,925 --> 00:41:50,359
All of them.

732
00:41:50,395 --> 00:41:52,592
The <i>Ning'tao</i> has
dropped out of warp.

733
00:41:52,633 --> 00:41:54,159
She's engaging the enemy.

734
00:41:57,076 --> 00:41:59,069
Die well, Worf.

735
00:42:00,615 --> 00:42:03,178
Today was not my day to die.

736
00:42:04,924 --> 00:42:06,450
Worf!

737
00:42:06,494 --> 00:42:08,964
But then who?

738
00:42:08,998 --> 00:42:10,592
Kor!

739
00:42:10,635 --> 00:42:13,128
He surprised me
outside the transporter room

740
00:42:13,174 --> 00:42:14,301
with a hypospray.

741
00:42:16,314 --> 00:42:19,718
I hope that old fool
understands what he's doing.

742
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,288
How goes the battle?

743
00:42:21,324 --> 00:42:24,091
We're approaching the limit
of our sensor range...

744
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:27,159
but it appears that the enemy
formation has collapsed.

745
00:42:27,202 --> 00:42:29,434
The <i>Ning'tao</i> is
maneuvering rapidly.

746
00:42:29,473 --> 00:42:33,004
She's taking heavy fire
from the Jem'Hadar.

747
00:42:36,019 --> 00:42:38,012
I've lost contact.

748
00:42:38,057 --> 00:42:42,931
One ship... against ten...

749
00:42:42,966 --> 00:42:45,163
it doesn't seem possible.

750
00:42:45,205 --> 00:42:46,673
He will succeed.

751
00:42:46,707 --> 00:42:48,870
He is Kor...

752
00:42:48,912 --> 00:42:51,144
the <i>Dahar</i> Master.

753
00:43:01,938 --> 00:43:03,406
He's done it.

754
00:43:03,441 --> 00:43:05,434
The Jem'Hadar are out of time.

755
00:43:05,478 --> 00:43:09,646
They can no longer overtake us
before we reach the <i>Defiant.</i>

756
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:13,148
How... how did
that pompous old man

757
00:43:13,194 --> 00:43:15,562
hold off an entire
Jem'Hadar fleet

758
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,592
with only one ship?

759
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,572
Does it matter?

760
00:43:22,412 --> 00:43:25,145
Darok, give me that bottle.

761
00:43:28,124 --> 00:43:30,094
To Kor...

762
00:43:30,128 --> 00:43:31,995
the <i>Dahar</i> Master...

763
00:43:32,031 --> 00:43:34,524
a noble warrior to the end.

764
00:43:37,242 --> 00:43:43,483
<i>My-cho Qara, end-do keela</i>

765
00:43:43,521 --> 00:43:49,090
<i>bay-doH chum,</i>
<i>ka ree-do meela</i>

766
00:43:49,133 --> 00:43:52,367
<i>Stum-pa rip-to</i>

767
00:43:52,406 --> 00:43:56,403
<i>Maah-la ee'qo</i>

768
00:43:56,447 --> 00:43:59,248
<i>ree-kaH!</i>

769
00:43:59,286 --> 00:44:05,527
<i>Ree-kaH! Ree-kaH!</i>

770
00:44:05,565 --> 00:44:08,799
<i>Maah, so faH ka'lee</i>

771
00:44:08,905 --> 00:44:11,227
