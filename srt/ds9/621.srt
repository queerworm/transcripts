1
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:09,175
The Dominion has solidified its hold
in the Kalandra Sector.

2
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:12,679
They're trying to establish a supply line
running through Betazoid space

3
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:14,556
into the Argolis Cluster.

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,435
If they succeed, they will be able
to launch an attack against Vulcan.

5
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:23,314
Starfleet's going to try to cut them off
near the Tibor Nebula.

6
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:26,359
The Seventh Fleet
will be engaging the enemy in the morning.

7
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,737
DAX: The Seventh Fleet
is still at half-strength.

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,572
They took heavy losses at Sybaron.

9
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:32,949
Well, let's just hope
they can get the job done.

10
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:36,453
On a happier note,
I do have a bit of good news.

11
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:38,329
That makes a welcome change.

12
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:42,917
The Romulans have forced the Dominion
to retreat from the Benzite system.

13
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,961
That is good news.

14
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:46,212
The question is,

15
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:50,884
will the Romulans be willing
to leave Benzar after the war is over?

16
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:53,803
Once they capture territory,
they very rarely give it up.

17
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:57,057
Right now we need to concentrate
on beating the Dominion.

18
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,975
We'll worry about the Romulans later.

19
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:03,146
As some of you already know
Major Kira, Jake, and I

20
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,815
will be leaving for Bajor at 2200.

21
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:09,027
There's a war on.
This isn't a time for a vacation.

22
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,488
The archaeologists excavating B'Hala

23
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,782
have found something
they want the Emissary to see.

24
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,950
We'll be returning tomorrow night.

25
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:17,911
That's all, people.

26
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:29,464
"Will the Romulans leave Benzar?"

27
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:31,466
You love to bring up
the worst-case scenario

28
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:32,717
in these meetings, don't you?

29
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,552
Somebody has to.

30
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,516
Besides, everyone expects me
to be dour and suspicious.

31
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,643
I don't want to disappoint them.

32
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:44,103
If only they knew the real you.

33
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,356
That is the real me...

34
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,068
at least as far
as everyone else is concerned.

35
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:02,038
I can't tell you how pleased we are
by your visit, Emissary.

36
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,248
I'm glad to be here, Ranjen.

37
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:05,083
Oh, there's no need
to keep calling me Ranjen.

38
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,919
I'm a simple monk.
My order is quite informal.

39
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:08,962
You've certainly been busy.

40
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:12,674
The last time I visited the ruins,
none of these tunnels had been cut yet.

41
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:15,760
It's been a great deal of work
but we do it gladly.

42
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:18,805
Excavating the Holy City is a privilege.

43
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:22,183
Our efforts are an expression
of our faith in the Prophets

44
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,810
and in the Emissary.

45
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,062
SISKO: It's very inspiring to see.

46
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,023
-Something wrong, Jake?
-( sighs ) No.

47
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,734
It's just that my dad seems
to be taking his role as Emissary

48
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,236
very seriously these days.

49
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,196
You say that like you think
it's a bad thing.

50
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,574
Well, you have to admit, I mean...

51
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,076
it's a long way to come
to see some old ruins.

52
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:43,621
They may have found
some very important religious artifacts

53
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,373
in these "old ruins."

54
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,001
Yeah, I hope so.
Otherwise, I don't have a story.

55
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,295
Hey, try to look
like you're enjoying yourself.

56
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:51,629
Your father needs this.

57
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:56,175
It's good for him not to have to think
about the Dominion for a few hours.

58
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,302
( bats squeaking )

59
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,429
Oh, don't let the bats bother you.

60
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,890
-( bats chittering )
-KIRA: Don't worry. They rarely bite.

61
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,183
JAKE: Rarely? Uh, ugh.

62
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:07,604
We're directly below the Temple of B'Hala.

63
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:14,444
These walls predate the ancient city
by 10,000 years.

64
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,404
Uh, who built this place?

65
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,823
We don't know much about
the original inhabitants

66
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:23,578
but it appears they abandoned this site
some 25,000 years ago.

67
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,748
Over time, sediment buried the ruins.

68
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,917
And then B'Hala was built on top of them.

69
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,251
Precisely.

70
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:31,461
In here.

71
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,150
It's over 30,000 years old.

72
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,777
These inscriptions...

73
00:03:56,736 --> 00:04:00,823
they look like ancient Bajoran
but I can't quite make it out.

74
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,242
RANJEN: Neither can we.

75
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:06,621
Though we've been able to piece together
a few of the translations.

76
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,915
The syntax is unusual

77
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:13,044
but all forms of Bajoran
share certain root-ideograms.

78
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,630
You may recognize this one.

79
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,674
"Welcome."

80
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,969
Here's where it gets interesting.

81
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,311
I see you recognize it.

82
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,481
Wha-what? I don't.

83
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,400
It says...

84
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,986
"Welcome, Emissary."

85
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,948
Now you know why I asked you here.

86
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,250
The Sisko has come.

87
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,460
The circle is complete.

88
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,755
The Reckoning must begin.

89
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,465
The Reckoning?

90
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:01,634
Much will depend on the Sisko.

91
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,221
He is corporeal.

92
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:07,849
Limited.

93
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,268
He is the Sisko.

94
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:11,978
He will not waver.

95
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,522
He is of Bajor.

96
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,108
He will bring the Reckoning.

97
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,444
What is it you expect of me?

98
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,654
It will be the end.

99
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,115
Or the beginning.

100
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,159
I don't understand.

101
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,077
The Sisko will know.

102
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,750
( grunts )

103
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,090
Dad?

104
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:47,800
{\an8}Are you okay?

105
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,093
{\an8}( sighs )

106
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,386
{\an8}Yeah.

107
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:54,974
{\an8}The Prophets...

108
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,767
{\an8}they were here.

109
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,811
{\an8}They spoke to me.

110
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,564
{\an8}You had a vision, Emissary.
We saw nothing.

111
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:02,607
{\an8}What did they say?

112
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,942
{\an8}They mentioned something
about a Reckoning.

113
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,611
{\an8}Is that a part of some prophecy?

114
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:07,987
{\an8}Not one that I know of.

115
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,614
{\an8}Let's get out of here.

116
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,450
{\an8}It's all right, Jake.
We'll be leaving soon.

117
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:16,662
{\an8}I have got to find out
what those inscriptions say.

118
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,749
{\an8}I wish we could translate them
more quickly

119
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,959
{\an8}but we don't have the resources.

120
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,003
{\an8}Fortunately, we do.

121
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:32,345
{\an8}I had a pretty good idea what this was
the minute I laid eyes on it.

122
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:34,972
{\an8}That confirms it.

123
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,934
{\an8}It's a slab of stone
with some writing on it.

124
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,310
{\an8}Dax...

125
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:41,687
{\an8}What do you want me to say, Benjamin?

126
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,857
{\an8}I'm not picking up any
residual energy readings--

127
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:48,361
{\an8}certainly nothing that would explain
how it threw you across the room.

128
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,696
{\an8}I want you to translate the inscriptions.

129
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,783
I was afraid you were going to say that.

130
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,371
The Ranjen's translation program.

131
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,748
It's not complete,
but at least it's a start.

132
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,084
Good luck.

133
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,341
( sighs )

134
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,510
( chimes jingling )

135
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,470
CLERGYMAN: Services are about to begin.

136
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,105
Captain, services are about to begin.

137
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,152
WORF: <i>Ops to Captain Sisko.</i>

138
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,404
Go ahead.

139
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,656
WORF: <i>We just received</i>
<i>a communication from Bajor.</i>

140
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,783
Kai Winn is on her way to the station.

141
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,927
Welcome to Deep Space Nine, Your Eminence.

142
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,429
Thank you, Emissary.

143
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,139
What brings you to the station?

144
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,141
I should think that would be clear.

145
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,936
You removed an artifact
from an archaeological site

146
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,980
without consulting the Vedek Assembly.

147
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,566
I meant no disrespect.

148
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:12,612
You can understand
how we would be sensitive to such matters.

149
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,614
During the Occupation,

150
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,658
the Cardassians plundered
Bajor's historical treasures

151
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,327
as if it were their right.

152
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:23,664
I never imagined that you would behave
in such a manner.

153
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,292
I assure you that the artifact
will be returned

154
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,294
as soon as I've finished studying it.

155
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:31,881
I was not aware that you had
expertise in Bajoran history.

156
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,925
-I don't.
-Then why not leave the artifact

157
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,886
in the hands of those who do?

158
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,846
There are scholars on Bajor

159
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:41,766
who've devoted their lives
to the study of such things.

160
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,894
I understand, but I brought it here

161
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,396
because I believe
that's what the Prophets want.

162
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,648
I see.

163
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:52,610
Then I take it this has something to do
with your vision?

164
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:53,736
Exactly.

165
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,280
Forgive me.

166
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:59,367
I-I didn't realize
that the Prophets told you

167
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,202
to bring the relic here.

168
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,913
Well, they didn't... not in so many words.

169
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,581
I see.

170
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:08,376
Then exactly what did they say?

171
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,378
( sighs )

172
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,797
It's difficult to explain.

173
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,424
The Prophets are not always clear.

174
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,886
Well, since they have never spoken to me

175
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,639
I'll have to take your word for it.

176
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,726
All I know is, for now, it belongs here.

177
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:30,731
Who am I to argue
with the Emissary of the Prophets?

178
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:42,493
And then she contacted Starfleet
and lodged a formal protest.

179
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,413
Is that why Admiral Ross
wanted to talk to you?

180
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,665
Well, how'd it go?

181
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,626
He told me to stop meddling
in Bajoran affairs

182
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,503
and return the damn tablet.

183
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,798
You know how Starfleet feels
about this Emissary thing.

184
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:59,051
It makes them very uncomfortable
that you've allowed the Bajorans

185
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,470
to view you as a religious icon.

186
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,598
It used to make you uncomfortable, too.

187
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,434
Not anymore.

188
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:10,813
I guess the Prophets have spoken to me
one too many times.

189
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:14,108
I remember when you used
to call them "wormhole aliens."

190
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,903
Wormhole aliens or Prophets...
it really doesn't matter.

191
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:22,074
The fact is, they exist out of time
and over the centuries

192
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,035
they've given the Bajorans
glimpses of the future

193
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,037
glimpses that the Bajorans
have written down

194
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,998
to help them guide succeeding generations.

195
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:34,044
If whatever is written here
can help me avoid mistakes

196
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:37,381
can help me make the right decisions
then I'd be a fool to ignore it.

197
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,551
Fair enough, but if you don't mind

198
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:43,637
I'm going to continue to think
of them as wormhole aliens.

199
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,723
All I know is...

200
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:49,727
that they have a relationship with Bajor

201
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,354
that stretches back over a thousand years.

202
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:55,191
They care what happens to Bajorans.

203
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,568
They proved that
when they kept the Dominion fleet

204
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:58,944
from coming through the wormhole.

205
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,821
Didn't you have to talk them into it?

206
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:05,659
Didn't they say they would exact
some kind of penance for helping you?

207
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,953
Yes, but they listened,

208
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:11,874
and they saved Bajor
and the rest of the Alpha Quadrant.

209
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,502
Now they're asking me
for something in return.

210
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,420
I don't know what it is yet

211
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,548
and I'm not going to return
the tablet until I do.

212
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,301
It's the key. I can feel it.

213
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,345
I hope you're wrong about that, Benjamin.

214
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,888
What have you got?

215
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,432
The computer has translated
part of the inscription.

216
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,976
It probably lacks the eloquence
of the original passage

217
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,853
but you'll get the gist of it.

218
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,648
Here it is in modern Bajoran.

219
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,736
SISKO: "The time of Reckoning is at hand.

220
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,113
"The Prophets will weep.

221
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,116
"Their sorrow will consume...

222
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,499
the Gateway to the Temple."

223
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,794
Tell me I'm wrong...

224
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:01,465
but isn't the Gateway
to the Temple Deep Space Nine?

225
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,894
I was just telling you
what the translation said.

226
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,437
I did not say I believed it.

227
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,855
Well, I'm not worried.

228
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,108
If you look hard enough
you'll find a Bajoran prophecy

229
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,109
for just about anything.

230
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,070
The ancient texts are a tangle
of vague contradictions.

231
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,072
Well, this one is anything but vague

232
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,825
and Bajoran prophecies
have an odd way of coming true.

233
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,535
Don't say you believe in this stuff, too?

234
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,704
Odo believes in preparing for the worst.

235
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:32,830
True.

236
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,874
He's as bad as the Bajorans.

237
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,878
Business hasn't been this slow
since the Dominion was here.

238
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,673
You know, I feel I have a civic duty

239
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,884
to do something
about all this doom and gloom

240
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,428
which is why I want to tell you
that I've extended happy hour.

241
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:48,804
Extended it?

242
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,349
From now on, every hour is happy hour...

243
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,852
at least until business picks up.

244
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,395
Eat, drink, and be merry.

245
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,230
For tomorrow, we die.

246
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,484
So what does the Captain say about this?

247
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,028
He is reserving judgment

248
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,988
until the computer
has finished the translation.

249
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,657
Who knows? The rest
of the tablet probably says

250
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,618
"Go to Quark's. It's happy hour."

251
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,077
I like the way you think, Doctor.

252
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,914
Well, this is ridiculous.
Nothing's going to happen.

253
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,874
Someday, we're all going
to look back on this and laugh.

254
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,294
( deep rumbling )

255
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,212
ODO: What was that?

256
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,685
( deep rumbling )

257
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,440
How did that prophecy go again?

258
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,697
KIRA: You don't have to do this, you know.

259
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,449
ODO: Don't have to do what?

260
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,369
Sit here, watch me eat.

261
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,705
I don't mind.
In fact, I rather enjoy it.

262
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,333
You eat with such gusto...

263
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:01,877
most of the time.

264
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,921
Not today.

265
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,343
I just wish that we knew more
about the Reckoning.

266
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:12,179
It would give us a better idea
of what the Prophets want from us.

267
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:17,184
It seems to me that, if the Prophets

268
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,645
want the Bajoran people
to follow a given path

269
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:22,898
they should provide
more specific directions.

270
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,192
It doesn't work like that.

271
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,860
Maybe it should.

272
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,488
The Kai would say that you lack faith.

273
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,533
And you would agree.

274
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,829
I just don't know how people
make it through the day without it.

275
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,415
We manage.

276
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,876
Besides, I do have faith in some things.

277
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,628
( chuckling ) Such as?

278
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,838
You.

279
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,552
I'll try not to disappoint you.

280
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,684
No doubt you've heard
the latest news from Bajor.

281
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,979
About the flooding
in the Rakantha Province, yes.

282
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,568
There was also an earthquake
in the Kendra Valley last night.

283
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:11,113
This morning, a tornado struck Tamulna.

284
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:14,241
Our sensors indicate
that Bajor has been affected

285
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:15,993
by the instability of the wormhole.

286
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,494
How comforting.

287
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,581
Tell me, do your sensors
have an explanation

288
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,541
for the instability itself?

289
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,127
No.

290
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,129
Then I'll give you one.

291
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:32,468
You've angered the Prophets
by taking the tablet from Bajor.

292
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,012
As the spiritual leader
of the Bajoran people

293
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,556
I'm asking you to return it.

294
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,767
And as the Emissary of the Prophets

295
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,352
I will ask you to give me
more time to study it.

296
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,563
I believe it is the will of the Prophets.

297
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,857
Well, I disagree.

298
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,526
This is a formal request
from the First Minister

299
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,237
for you to turn over the relic to me.

300
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,407
You must have been very persuasive.

301
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,911
This is the first time
you and Shakaar have agreed on anything.

302
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,207
If you deny his request, I promise you

303
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:07,586
it will damage relations
between Bajor and the Federation.

304
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,844
The tablet...

305
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,723
will be on its way to Bajor
on the morning transport.

306
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:20,933
( places padd on desk )

307
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:26,980
As will I.

308
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,783
You're sending it back?
And I was just starting to have fun.

309
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:41,662
I'm not letting you off the hook, old man.
I need these inscriptions translated.

310
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:45,290
I can work off the holo-recordings
I took yesterday.

311
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,042
Have you made any more progress?

312
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,378
Good news or bad?

313
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,754
-That depends.
-On what?

314
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,589
On what this ideogram means.

315
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,591
The computer has given me
two possibilities.

316
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,592
They are?

317
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,761
During the Reckoning

318
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,972
the Bajorans will either "suffer horribly"

319
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,015
or "eat fruit."

320
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:04,810
"Eat fruit"?

321
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:09,439
Given the tone
of the rest of the inscriptions

322
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,526
I would bet on horrible suffering.

323
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,403
What else do you have?

324
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,531
You'll love this. It's about you.

325
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:22,411
"Once the Reckoning begins,
the Emissary will..."

326
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,246
Go on.

327
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,873
I was hoping you could tell me.

328
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,750
Well, the rest of the
inscription's damaged.

329
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,419
Oh, that figures.

330
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,671
( deep rumbling )

331
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,923
Oh, I wish the wormhole
would stop doing that.

332
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,925
So do I. Keep at it, old man.

333
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,510
Just do me one favor.

334
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:42,181
If you talk to the Prophets again
ask for a dictionary...

335
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,057
please.

336
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,101
I'll see what I can do.

337
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,144
Thank you.

338
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:56,987
Captain, I have a message for you
from General Martok.

339
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,030
Go ahead.

340
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,282
He's dispatched
three Klingon attack cruisers

341
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,202
to bolster the defense perimeter
around the Dorala system.

342
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:07,581
Good. I just hope they can hold out
until Starfleet sends in reinforcements.

343
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:10,167
The Klingons will hold out.
Martok will see to it.

344
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,672
Long day?

345
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,507
They seem to get longer.

346
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,177
You'll feel better in the morning...

347
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,429
once the Kai is off the station.

348
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,473
( chuckling )

349
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,392
She may be the spiritual leader
of millions of Bajorans

350
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,811
but she is not an easy woman to like.

351
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,981
Well, if it's any comfort
I don't think she likes you, either.

352
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,733
I've known that for a while.

353
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,360
I guess I should have consulted her

354
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,820
before I brought the artifact
up to the station.

355
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,656
She would have tried to stop you.

356
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,991
Ah... that's why I didn't ask her.

357
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,202
In a way, I feel sorry for her.

358
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,747
She spends her whole life
in service to the Prophets.

359
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:52,960
Then one day, after years
of self-sacrifice and commitment

360
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,504
she gets her reward. She's elected Kai.

361
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:58,048
Should've been the greatest
moment of her life.

362
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,595
But my being the Emissary
spoiled it for her.

363
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,890
Well, the Kai's always been
the spiritual leader of Bajor

364
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,268
but Winn has to share that role with you

365
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,686
and to make matters worse

366
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,771
you're an outsider, a non-Bajoran.

367
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,940
That's something
she can never forgive you for.

368
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:18,068
I guess that's why she made
such an issue of the whole thing.

369
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,070
Well, she's jealous of you

370
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:23,240
and of your relationship
with the Prophets.

371
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:25,742
I'm a little envious myself.

372
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,452
Why?

373
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:30,289
You speak with the Prophets.

374
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,748
They listen to you.

375
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,083
That's...

376
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,002
that's a rare gift.

377
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,337
Certainly nothing I asked for.

378
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:41,508
I guess that's why I don't
resent you, but the Kai does.

379
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,887
I'll keep that in mind.

380
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,069
Is something wrong, Eminence?

381
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,573
What makes you say that, child?

382
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:05,782
You seem troubled.

383
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,117
Not at all.

384
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,869
I am quite relieved

385
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:11,788
the Emissary has decided
to do the right thing.

386
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,749
Well, you didn't leave him
much choice, did you?

387
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:18,253
I suppose you think
I enjoyed forcing his hand.

388
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,965
I assure you, I did not.

389
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:26,303
I wish the situation had been resolved
more amicably.

390
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,847
Perhaps the next time
we have a disagreement

391
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,141
he'll consider my wishes
more thoughtfully.

392
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:32,392
The next time?

393
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,352
You're anticipating more disagreements?

394
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,232
I merely meant to express
my hope that, in the future

395
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,610
we can work together
for the good of Bajor.

396
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:42,903
Of course.

397
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:45,822
After all, you are on the same side,
aren't you?

398
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,157
Naturally.

399
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,868
We both serve the Prophets.

400
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:51,912
There is no higher calling.

401
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,585
( deep rumbling )

402
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:02,589
( sighs )

403
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:03,590
( door chimes )

404
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:04,591
Yes?

405
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,135
Jake-o.

406
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,061
You're up late.

407
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,979
Oh, so are you.

408
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,189
What's on your mind?

409
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,859
I don't know. I guess I just wanted to see
if you're all right.

410
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:25,779
I'm fine.

411
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,573
Since when did you become a worrier?

412
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:31,743
I don't know.

413
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,412
It's this Emissary stuff.

414
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,456
It scares me a little.

415
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,132
Twice now...

416
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,008
twice in one year...

417
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,387
Dr. Bashir's called me
down to the Infirmary

418
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,430
to tell me something was wrong with you

419
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,474
and there you were

420
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:58,603
lying unconscious on a bio-bed
having visions or something.

421
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:01,815
And there...

422
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:04,025
all I could do was just stand there

423
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,611
and, and wonder...

424
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,322
if you were ever going to wake up.

425
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,661
I know it hasn't been easy, Jake.

426
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,205
I don't want it to happen again.

427
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:25,088
You know, I didn't ask
to be the Emissary...

428
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:31,219
but, for better or worse,
I guess that's what I am...

429
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,682
except for being your dad.

430
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:26,524
Why do you always have to be
so damned mysterious?

431
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,111
Answer me.

432
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,865
I am tired of your riddles!

433
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:39,162
If there's something
you need me to do, say so!

434
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,501
( yelling )

435
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,239
Let me guess.

436
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,117
You accidentally knocked it over.

437
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,077
Not exactly.

438
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,370
I didn't think so.

439
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:22,747
So what did happen?

440
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:27,043
I just had this uncontrollable urge

441
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,878
to smash the tablet.

442
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,298
Oh, I get those urges all the time.

443
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,800
Of course, I never act on them.

444
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:39,222
I'm not reading
any residual energy signatures.

445
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:42,517
That's impossible.
Check the station's internal sensors.

446
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:45,979
Nothing.

447
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,772
I tell you, I saw something.

448
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,149
We believe you, Captain.

449
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:51,651
Oh, please, Constable, don't patronize me.

450
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,532
Sisko to Ops. Report.

451
00:26:57,615 --> 00:27:00,118
We just experienced
a station-wide power drain.

452
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,828
We're attempting to determine the source.

453
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:03,038
Keep me informed.

454
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,080
WORF: <i>Aye, sir.</i>

455
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:10,086
It's possible the power drain is related
to this energy discharge you saw.

456
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,340
I'm starting to think the same thing.

457
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:18,345
Benjamin, you're not getting
another urge, are you?

458
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,221
No.

459
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,185
I've done what I needed to do.

460
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,272
I know this might sound strange

461
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:33,318
but I think the Prophets
wanted me to shatter the tablet.

462
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,653
Try explaining that to Kai Winn.

463
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:39,032
I can't believe that you'd be so petty

464
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:42,619
as to destroy the artifact
rather than turn it over to me.

465
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:44,120
That's not why I did it.

466
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:48,500
You expect me to believe
that the Prophets wanted you

467
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:52,545
to destroy a priceless piece
of Bajor's history?

468
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,714
That's exactly what you have to believe.

469
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,425
And why would they do that?

470
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,844
I wish I had an answer for you.

471
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,180
Well, I'm sure you'll
come up with something.

472
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:08,561
You and I haven't always
seen things eye to eye

473
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:10,271
but we have one thing in common--

474
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,108
we both believe that the Prophets
have a plan for Bajor.

475
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:16,361
Now, sometimes,
it's not easy to see the path

476
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:17,987
they've laid out for us.

477
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:23,159
Right now, I don't know
what they want from me

478
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:26,162
but I'm willing to take a leap of faith
and trust that they're guiding me

479
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,957
and I'm asking you to
take that leap with me.

480
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,252
There's no need
for a leap of faith, Emissary.

481
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:34,838
The Prophets have made it quite clear.

482
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:39,384
Two-thirds of the Rakantha wheat harvest
have been destroyed by floods.

483
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:42,011
Earthquakes have devastated
Kendra Province

484
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,972
leaving hundreds homeless.

485
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:47,475
Bajorans are suffering because of you.

486
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:51,020
They're paying the price
for your act of sacrilege.

487
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,650
<i>Odo to Captain Sisko.</i>

488
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,152
Go ahead.

489
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,612
ODO:<i> You'd better come down</i>
<i>to the Promenade, sir.</i>

490
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:00,864
Is there a problem?

491
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,824
ODO:<i> I'll let you be the judge of that.</i>

492
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:18,006
I think we've found the source
of the power fluctuations.

493
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,675
When I tried to talk to her,
she ignored me.

494
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,684
( wind whistling )

495
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,519
( glass exploding )

496
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:48,870
( voice reverberating) You...
are the Sisko.

497
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:52,916
Keep your hands off your weapons.

498
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,042
It's a Prophet.

499
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,921
Why have you taken this woman's body?

500
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,799
This vessel is willing.

501
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,010
The Reckoning...

502
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,429
it is time.

503
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,397
SISKO: The Reckoning... what is it?

504
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:17,941
The end...

505
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,984
or the beginning.

506
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,402
I don't understand.

507
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,199
I await Kosst Amojan.

508
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:27,826
The Evil One.

509
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:32,539
A Pah-wraith
banished from the Celestial Temple.

510
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:36,960
You're saying a Pah-wraith
will take corporeal form as well?

511
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:38,628
The battle will be joined.

512
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,673
This battle... is it to be fought here?

513
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,883
Bajor will be reborn.

514
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,053
Shabren's Fifth Prophecy--

515
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,305
the Rebirth.

516
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:53,393
If the Evil One is destroyed
it will bring a thousand years of peace--

517
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:57,313
the Golden Age of Bajor.

518
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,275
If it is destroyed?

519
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,696
Who will prevail is not known.

520
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,614
What do you want from me?

521
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:09,200
Am I supposed to help you in some way?

522
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:13,204
The Sisko has completed his task.

523
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,501
Forgive my blindness.

524
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,506
Prophet, hear me.

525
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,550
I am the Kai of Bajor.

526
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:30,096
I offer myself to you
as your humble servant.

527
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,390
I await their vessel.

528
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,809
Speak to me.

529
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,061
Tell me what I should do.

530
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,032
We're evacuating.

531
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,784
You can't be serious.

532
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,120
This battle could destroy the station.

533
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:55,872
Then don't let it be fought here.

534
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:57,916
I don't have any choice.

535
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,334
Yes, you do.

536
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:02,378
We can flood the Promenade
with chroniton radiation.

537
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:04,881
Are you suggesting that we kill a Prophet?

538
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,007
I won't do that.

539
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,717
BASHIR: You don't have to.

540
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,470
If you ramp up the chroniton levels slowly

541
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,138
you'll give the wormhole alien
a chance to leave

542
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,057
Kira's body without getting hurt.

543
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,517
DAX: We have everything rigged
and ready to go.

544
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:17,769
Just say the word.

545
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:23,441
No.

546
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:24,734
Benjamin.

547
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:29,447
Deep Space Nine is critical
to the defense of the Federation.

548
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,074
We cannot risk destroying it.

549
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:34,410
When the Dominion fleet
was about to come through the wormhole

550
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,746
I asked the Prophets for their help.

551
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:38,081
They gave it to me.

552
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,041
Now they're asking for my help.

553
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:43,294
They need to fight this battle here, now.

554
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,880
I'm not going to jeopardize my crew

555
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,884
but I'm not going to stand
in the way of the Prophets, either.

556
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,594
What if the Prophets lose?

557
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,846
Are you willing to sacrifice Kira?

558
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:57,058
The Prophet said she was willing
to be their instrument.

559
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,434
And you believe that?

560
00:32:58,518 --> 00:32:59,477
I do.

561
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:06,192
I know how important
her faith is to her and...

562
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:09,112
I have no doubt that
she would allow the Prophets

563
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,489
to use her as their instrument.

564
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:18,413
I'll notify Starfleet that
we're abandoning the station.

565
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,499
Begin the evacuation immediately.

566
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,180
ODO: Hurry along, now. Hurry along.

567
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,558
-Is this transport full?
-There's room.

568
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:40,560
I'm going to check the
Promenade for stragglers.

569
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:45,398
Odo, you should've helped us
persuade the Captain to end this.

570
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:47,400
I had to respect Kira's wishes.

571
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,445
If it were Dax, I am not sure
I could've done the same.

572
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:53,072
Well, just be grateful
you didn't have to make that choice.

573
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:57,452
For your sake, I hope
the Prophets are victorious.

574
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:00,538
They will be
if Kira has anything to do with it.

575
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:03,875
Come on.

576
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:07,795
Report.

577
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,089
We expect to be down to a skeleton crew
within the hour.

578
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:11,424
Very well.

579
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:12,884
What did Starfleet have to say?

580
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,635
I managed to convince them

581
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,846
that we couldn't afford
to defy the Prophets.

582
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,556
WORF: They are the only thing
that's keeping the Dominion

583
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,099
from coming through the wormhole.

584
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:23,936
The only problem is, there's no guarantee
the Prophets will win this battle.

585
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,313
<i>Odo to Sisko.</i>

586
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,773
Go ahead, Constable.

587
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,274
ODO:<i> Captain, there's a group of Bajorans</i>

588
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,902
<i>on the Promenade</i>
<i>who are refusing to leave.</i>

589
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:38,159
WINN:<i> Tera dak embah</i> <i>ihsehelm ran embah...</i>

590
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,787
ALL: <i>de-ram ta-meen.</i>

591
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,457
<i>Tera dak ihsehelm</i>

592
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,000
<i>ran embah...</i>

593
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,252
ALL: <i>de-ram ta-meen...</i>

594
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,296
The last transports are standing by.

595
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,634
WINN:<i> Tera dak ihsehelm</i> <i>ran embah...</i>

596
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,260
Eminence.

597
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:57,637
<i>...ta-meen.</i>

598
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,015
Emissary.

599
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,683
These people have to go.

600
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,604
We're offering prayers
for the Prophets' victory.

601
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:09,649
The Prophets will hear your prayers
wherever you are.

602
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,359
It isn't safe here.

603
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:15,113
Then why are you still here, Emissary?

604
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:18,116
The Prophet told you your task was done.

605
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,201
I am Captain of this station

606
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,787
and I will do everything
in my power to save it.

607
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,623
Now, are you going to
tell these people to go

608
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:26,958
or shall I?

609
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:33,714
My children

610
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,758
the Prophets have heard your prayers.

611
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,176
You must go.

612
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,224
Take them to the transports.

613
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:47,311
All right, this way.

614
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:49,772
Congratulations, Emissary.

615
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:52,567
Thanks to you the Prophets'
victory is at hand.

616
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,026
I hope you're right.

617
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,571
Where is your faith, Emissary?

618
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:59,907
You don't think the Evil One
will be victorious, do you?

619
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:04,871
Rest assured, the Golden Age is upon us.

620
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,833
The Prophets and the people
will be as one.

621
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,626
Think of it.

622
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:14,005
There will be no need for vedeks or kais

623
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,340
or even Emissaries.

624
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,263
Kosst Amojan has chosen its vessel.

625
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:35,902
Let it begin.

626
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,996
Leave my son and take me instead!

627
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:51,250
Your Emissary offers himself to us.

628
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:53,920
His faith wavers.

629
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:56,839
( grunting )

630
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:08,976
( groaning )

631
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,712
Emissary, we must go.

632
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,184
Benjamin, Worf is standing by in Ops.

633
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,062
He can trigger the chroniton generator
at your command.

634
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,272
You can still end this, Ben.

635
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,856
No, I've got to play this thing out.

636
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,525
That is your son out there.

637
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,403
Don't you think I know that?
The Prophets will protect him.

638
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:02,113
They're trying to kill him.

639
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:04,782
No. They're trying
to destroy the Pah-wraith.

640
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:07,368
The Prophets will not let
anything happen to him.

641
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:08,703
How do you know that?

642
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:09,912
I know.

643
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:13,332
We've got to get out of here.

644
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,750
According to the sensors,

645
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:18,045
the energy building between them
could explode at any second.

646
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,755
I'm not going to leave Jake here.

647
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,467
We must go, Emissary.

648
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:24,552
Benjamin...

649
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,346
Get out of here!
Get off the station, both of you!

650
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,472
That's an order!

651
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:29,849
Come, child. We must go.

652
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:39,817
Dax to Worf.

653
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:44,655
Go ahead.

654
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,907
Meet me at Airlock Eight. We're leaving.

655
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:53,080
Go on ahead.
Airlock Eight is down to the right.

656
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:56,667
This way. Move quickly.

657
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,794
Let's go. Come on.

658
00:38:58,878 --> 00:38:59,920
Hurry up.

659
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,089
It's okay, it's okay.

660
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,716
I think the transport is down here.

661
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,118
No!

662
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:35,122
COMPUTER:
<i>Chroniton levels at 37% and rising.</i>

663
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,335
May the Prophets forgive me.

664
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:04,610
Jake...

665
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:15,329
SISKO: <i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

666
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:19,291
<i>The station's population</i> <i>has returned</i>
<i>and repairs are underway.</i>

667
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,753
<i>Major Kira has recovered</i>
<i>from her experience...</i>

668
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,798
<i>but my son is still</i> <i>in the Infirmary.</i>

669
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:28,217
Jake?

670
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,178
He'll be, uh, laid up for a few days
but he'll be all right.

671
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,346
May I see him?

672
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,347
Oh, yes.

673
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:42,314
Jake...

674
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:46,861
Dad.

675
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:48,487
How are you feeling?

676
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,323
Could be worse.

677
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,119
You'll be up and about in no time.

678
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:00,541
I don't know what to say.

679
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,627
Say you're happy to see me.

680
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,172
You know I am.

681
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:10,092
I wish I...

682
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:14,513
I want to explain what happened...

683
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:18,726
but I'm not sure that I can.

684
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,313
You don't have to explain.

685
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,733
When the Pah-wraith was inside me

686
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:28,777
I could feel its hatred

687
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:33,199
and I knew that no matter what

688
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,784
it couldn't be allowed to win...

689
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,997
even if it meant I had to die.

690
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,502
You did the right thing.

691
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,142
How was the prayer service?

692
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:02,770
To tell you the truth
I didn't pay that much attention.

693
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:05,356
I'm still trying to make sense
out of everything that happened.

694
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:09,652
I mean, of all the people on this station
the Prophets chose me.

695
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:13,948
I'm not sure I know why
I deserve that honor.

696
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:16,700
Perhaps that's why you were chosen.
You have faith and humility.

697
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:18,994
I heard that you told the Captain

698
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:21,539
that I was willing to give my life
to serve the Prophets.

699
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,209
I appreciate that you respect my beliefs.

700
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:30,965
Just the same, I wouldn't have minded
if the Prophets had chosen someone else.

701
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,094
I have to go.

702
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:38,389
I'll drop by Security
after I take the Kai to her shuttle.

703
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,734
The Emissary couldn't escort me himself?

704
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:52,611
He's with his son.

705
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,989
I would think he'd want to thank me.

706
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,615
For what?

707
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:59,952
I prevented the destruction
of this station.

708
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:04,123
I saved the Emissary's life
and the life of his son.

709
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:06,500
Don't pretend you did it for the Captain.

710
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,919
I did it for Bajor.

711
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:12,256
If you haven't heard,
the floodwaters have receded

712
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:14,216
and the earthquakes have stopped.

713
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,302
And you're going to take credit for that?

714
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:20,472
I take it as a sign I did the right thing.

715
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,516
You defied the will of the Prophets

716
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,892
and you did it

717
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:27,980
because you couldn't stand
the fact that a human, an infidel,

718
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:30,566
had a stronger faith than you.

719
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:33,611
The Emissary was willing
to sacrifice his own son

720
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,154
to serve the Prophets.

721
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:38,699
My faith is as pure as the Emissary's.

722
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:43,787
I think you're confusing faith
with ambition.

723
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:47,708
I'm not confusing anything,
child, you are.

724
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:51,295
The Prophets chose you
as their instrument.

725
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:54,298
That doesn't mean you can speak for them.

726
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:58,177
Because of your interference,
the Reckoning was stopped.

727
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,179
The evil still exists.

728
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:05,142
And I'm not sure if even the Prophets know
what that will mean for Bajor.
