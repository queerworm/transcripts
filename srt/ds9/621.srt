1
00:00:07,175 --> 00:00:08,906
The Dominion
has solidified its hold

2
00:00:08,947 --> 00:00:10,382
in the Kalandra Sector.

3
00:00:10,417 --> 00:00:12,046
They're trying
to establish a supply line

4
00:00:12,087 --> 00:00:15,493
running through Betazoid space
into the Argolis Cluster.

5
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:17,625
If they succeed,
they will be able

6
00:00:17,668 --> 00:00:19,399
to launch an attack
against Vulcan.

7
00:00:19,438 --> 00:00:22,377
Starfleet's going to try
to cut them off

8
00:00:22,412 --> 00:00:24,109
near the Tibor Nebula.

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,212
The Seventh Fleet
will be engaging the enemy

10
00:00:26,255 --> 00:00:27,314
in the morning.

11
00:00:27,357 --> 00:00:29,590
The Seventh Fleet is
still at half-strength.

12
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:31,623
They took heavy losses
at Sybaron.

13
00:00:31,667 --> 00:00:34,196
Well, let's just hope
they can get the job done.

14
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,681
On a happier note,
I do have a bit of good news.

15
00:00:37,716 --> 00:00:39,516
That makes a welcome change.

16
00:00:39,553 --> 00:00:41,649
The Romulans
have forced the Dominion

17
00:00:41,691 --> 00:00:43,685
to retreat
from the Benzite system.

18
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,860
That is good news.

19
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:49,068
The question is,
will the Romulans be willing

20
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,810
to leave Benzar
after the war is over?

21
00:00:51,849 --> 00:00:54,481
Once they capture territory,
they very rarely give it up.

22
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:55,752
Right now

23
00:00:55,792 --> 00:00:58,025
we need to concentrate
on beating the Dominion.

24
00:00:58,064 --> 00:01:00,433
We'll worry
about the Romulans later.

25
00:01:01,572 --> 00:01:04,876
As some of you already know,
Major Kira, Jake and I

26
00:01:04,914 --> 00:01:07,078
will be leaving for Bajor
at 2200.

27
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,247
There's a war on.

28
00:01:08,288 --> 00:01:10,259
This isn't a time
for a vacation.

29
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,627
The archeologists
excavating B'Hala

30
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:15,137
have found something
they want the Emissary to see.

31
00:01:15,172 --> 00:01:17,268
We'll be returning
tomorrow night.

32
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,213
That's all, people.

33
00:01:27,468 --> 00:01:30,806
"Will the Romulans
leave Benzar?"

34
00:01:30,843 --> 00:01:32,608
You love to bring up
the worst-case scenario

35
00:01:32,647 --> 00:01:34,082
in these meetings, don't you?

36
00:01:34,117 --> 00:01:35,746
Somebody has to.

37
00:01:35,788 --> 00:01:40,732
Besides, everyone expects me
to be dour and suspicious.

38
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:43,330
I don't want to disappoint them.

39
00:01:43,406 --> 00:01:45,502
If only they knew the real you.

40
00:01:45,545 --> 00:01:47,675
That is the real me...

41
00:01:47,717 --> 00:01:51,214
at least as far
as everyone else is concerned.

42
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:01,573
I can't tell you
how pleased we are

43
00:02:01,616 --> 00:02:02,983
by your visit, Emissary.

44
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,580
I'm glad to be here, Ranjen.

45
00:02:04,623 --> 00:02:06,651
Oh, there's no need
to keep calling me ranjen.

46
00:02:06,695 --> 00:02:07,663
I'm a simple monk.

47
00:02:07,698 --> 00:02:08,962
My order is quite informal.

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,094
You've certainly been busy.

49
00:02:10,137 --> 00:02:11,504
The last time
I visited the ruins

50
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,443
none of these tunnels
had been cut yet.

51
00:02:13,478 --> 00:02:16,975
It's been a great deal of work,
but we do it gladly.

52
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,754
Excavating the Holy City
is a privilege.

53
00:02:19,793 --> 00:02:23,598
Our efforts are an expression
of our faith in the Prophets

54
00:02:23,636 --> 00:02:24,969
and in the Emissary.

55
00:02:25,006 --> 00:02:27,375
It's very inspiring to see.

56
00:02:27,478 --> 00:02:28,674
Something wrong, Jake?

57
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,376
No. It's just that my dad seems

58
00:02:31,488 --> 00:02:33,185
to be taking his role
as Emissary

59
00:02:33,225 --> 00:02:34,592
very seriously these days.

60
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:36,497
You say that like you think
it's a bad thing.

61
00:02:36,533 --> 00:02:38,800
Well, you have to admit,
I mean...

62
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:41,003
it's a long way to come
to see some old ruins.

63
00:02:41,044 --> 00:02:42,513
They may have found

64
00:02:42,547 --> 00:02:44,882
some very important
religious artifacts

65
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,412
in these "old ruins."

66
00:02:46,524 --> 00:02:47,857
Yeah, I hope so.

67
00:02:47,894 --> 00:02:49,227
Otherwise, I don't have a story.

68
00:02:49,264 --> 00:02:51,667
Hey, try to look
like you're enjoying yourself.

69
00:02:51,703 --> 00:02:52,933
Your father needs this.

70
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:55,410
It's good for him
not to have to think

71
00:02:55,445 --> 00:02:57,678
about the Dominion
for a few hours.

72
00:02:58,753 --> 00:03:00,279
Oh, don't let
the bats bother you.

73
00:03:01,326 --> 00:03:03,057
Don't worry.
They rarely bite.

74
00:03:03,097 --> 00:03:04,828
Rarely? Uh, ugh.

75
00:03:05,904 --> 00:03:09,036
We're directly below
the Temple of B'Hala.

76
00:03:09,078 --> 00:03:15,424
These wall predate the ancient
city by 10,000 years.

77
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,693
Uh, who built this place?

78
00:03:17,732 --> 00:03:20,330
We don't know much about
the original inhabitants

79
00:03:20,371 --> 00:03:22,239
but it appears
they abandoned this site

80
00:03:22,276 --> 00:03:25,044
some 25,000 years ago.

81
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:27,954
Over time,
sediment buried the ruins.

82
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:30,461
And then B'Hala was
built on top of them.

83
00:03:30,496 --> 00:03:31,965
Precisely.

84
00:03:31,999 --> 00:03:32,989
In here.

85
00:03:52,282 --> 00:03:55,723
It's over 30,000 years old.

86
00:03:55,757 --> 00:03:57,522
These inscriptions...

87
00:03:57,627 --> 00:03:59,860
they look like ancient Bajoran

88
00:03:59,899 --> 00:04:01,961
but I can't quite make it out.

89
00:04:02,004 --> 00:04:03,735
Neither can we

90
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:06,043
though we've been able
to piece together

91
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:07,949
a few of the translations.

92
00:04:07,986 --> 00:04:09,957
The syntax is unusual

93
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:14,490
but all forms of Bajoran
share certain root-ideograms.

94
00:04:14,602 --> 00:04:17,370
You may recognize this one.

95
00:04:17,408 --> 00:04:19,208
"Welcome."

96
00:04:19,246 --> 00:04:22,948
Here's where it gets
interesting.

97
00:04:30,005 --> 00:04:33,377
I see you recognize it.

98
00:04:33,413 --> 00:04:35,110
Wha-what? I don't.

99
00:04:35,151 --> 00:04:36,552
It says...

100
00:04:36,621 --> 00:04:39,560
"Welcome, Emissary."

101
00:04:39,628 --> 00:04:43,627
Now you know
why I asked you here.

102
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:53,790
The Sisko has come.

103
00:04:53,829 --> 00:04:56,529
The circle is complete.

104
00:04:56,569 --> 00:04:59,440
The Reckoning must begin.

105
00:04:59,476 --> 00:05:01,105
The Reckoning?

106
00:05:01,146 --> 00:05:03,413
Much will depend on the Sisko.

107
00:05:04,922 --> 00:05:08,020
He is corporeal.

108
00:05:08,063 --> 00:05:09,532
Limited.

109
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:12,404
He is the Sisko.

110
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,570
He will not waver.

111
00:05:14,645 --> 00:05:17,116
He is of Bajor.

112
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:19,384
He will bring the Reckoning.

113
00:05:19,424 --> 00:05:21,121
What is it you expect of me?

114
00:05:21,161 --> 00:05:23,029
It will be the end.

115
00:05:24,436 --> 00:05:26,532
Or the beginning.

116
00:05:26,574 --> 00:05:28,009
I don't understand.

117
00:05:28,045 --> 00:05:29,913
The Sisko will know.

118
00:07:45,153 --> 00:07:46,588
Dad?

119
00:07:46,623 --> 00:07:48,058
Are you okay?

120
00:07:49,865 --> 00:07:50,993
Yeah.

121
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,778
The Prophets...

122
00:07:55,812 --> 00:07:57,304
they were here.

123
00:07:57,349 --> 00:07:59,080
They spoke to me.

124
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,851
You had a vision, Emissary.

125
00:08:00,891 --> 00:08:01,950
We saw nothing.

126
00:08:01,994 --> 00:08:02,962
What did they say?

127
00:08:02,996 --> 00:08:05,331
They mentioned something
about a Reckoning.

128
00:08:05,369 --> 00:08:07,066
Is that a part of some prophecy?

129
00:08:07,106 --> 00:08:08,575
Not one that I know of.

130
00:08:08,609 --> 00:08:09,873
Let's get out of here.

131
00:08:09,913 --> 00:08:11,280
It's all right, Jake.

132
00:08:11,316 --> 00:08:12,751
We'll be leaving soon.

133
00:08:12,786 --> 00:08:17,092
I have got to find out
what those inscriptions say.

134
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,227
I wish we could
translate them more quickly

135
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,332
but we don't have
the resources.

136
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,608
Fortunately, we do.

137
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:30,628
I had a pretty good idea
what this was

138
00:08:30,662 --> 00:08:32,758
the minute I laid eyes on it.

139
00:08:33,903 --> 00:08:35,338
That confirms it.

140
00:08:35,374 --> 00:08:38,279
It's a slab of stone
with some writing on it.

141
00:08:38,314 --> 00:08:39,840
Dax...

142
00:08:39,885 --> 00:08:42,049
What do you want me to say,
Benjamin?

143
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:45,063
I'm not picking up any
residual energy readings...

144
00:08:45,097 --> 00:08:46,623
certainly nothing
that would explain

145
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:48,638
how it threw you
across the room.

146
00:08:48,672 --> 00:08:51,075
I want you to translate
the inscriptions.

147
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:54,215
I was afraid you were
going to say that.

148
00:08:56,224 --> 00:08:58,890
The Ranjen's
translation program.

149
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,459
It's not complete,
but at least it's a start.

150
00:09:01,503 --> 00:09:03,406
Good luck.

151
00:09:13,365 --> 00:09:15,199
Services are about to begin.

152
00:09:22,319 --> 00:09:24,552
Captain, services are
about to begin.

153
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,533
Ops to Captain Sisko.

154
00:09:30,573 --> 00:09:31,872
Go ahead.

155
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,211
We just received
a communication from Bajor.

156
00:09:34,315 --> 00:09:36,479
Kai Winn is on her way
to the station.

157
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,454
Welcome to Deep Space 9,
Your Eminence.

158
00:09:55,499 --> 00:09:56,866
Thank you, Emissary.

159
00:09:56,902 --> 00:09:58,964
What brings you to the station?

160
00:09:59,007 --> 00:10:01,478
I should think that
would be clear.

161
00:10:01,513 --> 00:10:04,281
You removed an artifact
from an archeological site

162
00:10:04,387 --> 00:10:06,517
without consulting
the Vedek Assembly.

163
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,530
I meant no disrespect.

164
00:10:08,564 --> 00:10:10,193
You can understand

165
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:13,834
how we would be sensitive
to such matters.

166
00:10:13,876 --> 00:10:16,781
During the Occupation,
the Cardassians plundered

167
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:20,086
Bajor's historical treasures
as if it were their right.

168
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:22,323
I never imagined
that you would behave

169
00:10:22,397 --> 00:10:23,696
in such a manner.

170
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:26,331
I assure you that the artifact
will be returned

171
00:10:26,373 --> 00:10:28,435
as soon as I've finished
studying it.

172
00:10:28,478 --> 00:10:32,580
I was not aware that you had
expertise in Bajoran history.

173
00:10:32,621 --> 00:10:34,352
- I don't.
- Then why not

174
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:37,831
leave the artifact
in the hands of those who do?

175
00:10:37,867 --> 00:10:39,461
There are scholars on Bajor

176
00:10:39,504 --> 00:10:42,500
who've devoted their lives
to the study of such things.

177
00:10:42,545 --> 00:10:45,016
I understand,
but I brought it here

178
00:10:45,051 --> 00:10:48,149
because I believe
that's what the Prophets want.

179
00:10:48,192 --> 00:10:49,217
I see.

180
00:10:49,261 --> 00:10:51,391
Then I take it
this has something to do

181
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:53,267
with your vision?

182
00:10:53,304 --> 00:10:54,568
Exactly.

183
00:10:54,607 --> 00:10:56,578
Forgive me.

184
00:10:56,612 --> 00:10:59,848
I-I didn't realize
that the Prophets told you

185
00:10:59,887 --> 00:11:01,516
to bring the relic here.

186
00:11:01,557 --> 00:11:04,359
Well, they didn't...
not in so many words.

187
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,265
I see.

188
00:11:06,302 --> 00:11:08,968
Then exactly what did they say?

189
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:13,039
It's difficult to explain.

190
00:11:13,085 --> 00:11:16,081
The Prophets are
not always clear.

191
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:20,032
Well, since they have never
spoken to me

192
00:11:20,068 --> 00:11:22,539
I'll have to take your word
for it.

193
00:11:22,574 --> 00:11:26,447
All I know is, for now,
it belongs here.

194
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:31,592
Who am I to argue with
the Emissary of the Prophets?

195
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,556
And then she contacted Starfleet
and lodged a formal protest.

196
00:11:43,592 --> 00:11:45,995
Is that why Admiral Ross
wanted to talk to you?

197
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:48,229
Well, how'd it go?

198
00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:51,037
He told me to stop meddling
in Bajoran affairs

199
00:11:51,076 --> 00:11:53,013
and return the damn tablet.

200
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:56,283
You know how Starfleet feels
about this Emissary thing.

201
00:11:56,321 --> 00:11:59,921
It makes them very uncomfortable
that you've allowed the Bajorans

202
00:11:59,964 --> 00:12:02,435
to view you as a religious icon.

203
00:12:02,503 --> 00:12:05,271
It used to make you
uncomfortable, too.

204
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,304
Not anymore.

205
00:12:07,348 --> 00:12:10,048
I guess the Prophets
have spoken to me

206
00:12:10,088 --> 00:12:11,387
one too many times.

207
00:12:11,425 --> 00:12:15,025
I remember when you used
to call them "wormhole aliens."

208
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,473
Wormhole aliens or Prophets...
it really doesn't matter.

209
00:12:18,508 --> 00:12:21,345
The fact is,
they exist out of time

210
00:12:21,381 --> 00:12:22,714
and over the centuries

211
00:12:22,751 --> 00:12:25,747
they've given the Bajorans
glimpses of the future

212
00:12:25,793 --> 00:12:27,764
glimpses that the Bajorans
have written down

213
00:12:27,797 --> 00:12:29,791
to help them guide
succeeding generations.

214
00:12:29,835 --> 00:12:34,973
If whatever is written here
can help me avoid mistakes

215
00:12:35,015 --> 00:12:36,678
can help me make
the right decisions

216
00:12:36,719 --> 00:12:38,279
then I'd be a fool to ignore it.

217
00:12:38,322 --> 00:12:41,022
Fair enough,
but if you don't mind

218
00:12:41,062 --> 00:12:44,525
I'm going to continue to think
of them as wormhole aliens.

219
00:12:44,637 --> 00:12:46,972
All I know is...

220
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:50,415
that they have
a relationship with Bajor

221
00:12:50,451 --> 00:12:53,253
that stretches back
over a thousand years.

222
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,957
They care what happens
to Bajorans.

223
00:12:55,998 --> 00:12:58,196
They proved that when they
kept the Dominion fleet

224
00:12:58,237 --> 00:12:59,672
from coming
through the wormhole.

225
00:12:59,707 --> 00:13:01,541
Didn't you have
to talk them into it?

226
00:13:02,547 --> 00:13:04,415
Didn't they say they would exact

227
00:13:04,452 --> 00:13:06,616
some kind of penance
for helping you?

228
00:13:06,657 --> 00:13:10,724
Yes, but they listened,
and they saved Bajor

229
00:13:10,767 --> 00:13:12,863
and the rest
of the Alpha Quadrant.

230
00:13:12,906 --> 00:13:15,275
Now they're asking me
for something in return.

231
00:13:15,311 --> 00:13:17,214
I don't know what it is yet

232
00:13:17,249 --> 00:13:20,485
and I'm not going to return
the tablet until I do.

233
00:13:20,523 --> 00:13:23,428
It's the key.
I can feel it.

234
00:13:23,464 --> 00:13:25,195
I hope you're wrong
about that, Benjamin.

235
00:13:25,235 --> 00:13:26,534
What have you got?

236
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:29,443
The computer has translated
part of the inscription.

237
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:31,780
It probably lacks the eloquence
of the original passage

238
00:13:31,817 --> 00:13:33,480
but you'll get the gist of it.

239
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:36,662
Here it is in modern Bajoran.

240
00:13:38,801 --> 00:13:41,603
"The time of Reckoning
is at hand.

241
00:13:41,674 --> 00:13:44,272
"The Prophets will weep.

242
00:13:44,313 --> 00:13:46,807
"Their sorrow will consume...

243
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:55,403
the Gateway to the Temple."

244
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,434
Tell me I'm wrong...

245
00:13:59,182 --> 00:14:02,554
but isn't the Gateway
to the Temple Deep Space 9?

246
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,885
I was just telling you
what the translation said.

247
00:14:15,923 --> 00:14:17,119
I did not say I believed it.

248
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:18,458
Well, I'm not worried.

249
00:14:18,495 --> 00:14:20,830
If you look hard enough,
you'll find a Bajoran prophecy

250
00:14:20,868 --> 00:14:21,962
for just about anything.

251
00:14:22,004 --> 00:14:24,636
The ancient texts are a tangle
of vague contradictions.

252
00:14:24,744 --> 00:14:26,647
Well, this one is
anything but vague

253
00:14:26,749 --> 00:14:27,843
and Bajoran prophecies

254
00:14:27,884 --> 00:14:29,478
have an odd way
of coming true.

255
00:14:29,522 --> 00:14:31,253
Don't say you believe
in this stuff, too?

256
00:14:31,293 --> 00:14:33,491
Odo believes in preparing
for the worst.

257
00:14:33,531 --> 00:14:34,499
True.

258
00:14:34,534 --> 00:14:37,132
He's as bad as the Bajorans.

259
00:14:37,173 --> 00:14:40,374
Business hasn't been this slow
since the Dominion was here.

260
00:14:41,885 --> 00:14:43,947
You know,
I feel I have a civic duty

261
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,656
to do something
about all this doom and gloom

262
00:14:46,697 --> 00:14:48,615
which is why I want to tell you
that I've extended happy hour.

263
00:14:48,748 --> 00:14:49,944
Extended it?

264
00:14:49,984 --> 00:14:53,425
From now on,
every hour is happy hour...

265
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,862
at least
until business picks up.

266
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:57,528
Eat, drink and be merry.

267
00:14:57,569 --> 00:14:59,437
For tomorrow, we die.

268
00:15:00,576 --> 00:15:03,276
So what does the Captain
say about this?

269
00:15:03,316 --> 00:15:04,444
He is reserving judgment

270
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:07,186
until the computer
has finished the translation.

271
00:15:07,225 --> 00:15:09,492
Who knows? The rest
of the tablet probably says

272
00:15:09,531 --> 00:15:11,832
"Go to Quark's.
It's happy hour."

273
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,271
I like the way you think,
Doctor.

274
00:15:13,307 --> 00:15:14,674
Well, this is ridiculous.

275
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:15,769
Nothing's going to happen.

276
00:15:15,812 --> 00:15:18,147
Someday, we're all going
to look back on this and laugh.

277
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:23,427
What was that?

278
00:15:40,605 --> 00:15:42,599
How did that prophecy go again?

279
00:15:47,722 --> 00:15:49,659
You don't have to do this,
you know.

280
00:15:49,694 --> 00:15:51,665
Don't have to do what?

281
00:15:51,699 --> 00:15:54,068
Sit here, watch me eat.

282
00:15:54,138 --> 00:15:56,302
I don't mind.

283
00:15:56,343 --> 00:15:57,903
In fact, I rather enjoy it.

284
00:15:57,947 --> 00:16:00,511
You eat with such gusto...

285
00:16:02,057 --> 00:16:03,116
most of the time.

286
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,097
Not today.

287
00:16:08,137 --> 00:16:10,506
I just wish that we knew more
about the Reckoning.

288
00:16:10,544 --> 00:16:11,877
It would give us a better idea

289
00:16:11,914 --> 00:16:13,440
of what the Prophets
want from us.

290
00:16:14,486 --> 00:16:18,393
It seems to me
that, if the Prophets

291
00:16:18,429 --> 00:16:20,491
want the Bajoran people
to follow a given path

292
00:16:20,534 --> 00:16:24,168
they should provide
more specific directions.

293
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,511
It doesn't work like that.

294
00:16:26,548 --> 00:16:28,211
Maybe it should.

295
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:30,690
The Kai would say
that you lack faith.

296
00:16:31,694 --> 00:16:33,858
And you would agree.

297
00:16:34,902 --> 00:16:36,371
I just don't know how people

298
00:16:36,406 --> 00:16:38,206
make it through the day
without it.

299
00:16:38,244 --> 00:16:40,738
We manage.

300
00:16:40,783 --> 00:16:44,280
Besides, I do have faith
in some things.

301
00:16:44,325 --> 00:16:45,885
Such as?

302
00:16:45,928 --> 00:16:47,124
You.

303
00:16:50,573 --> 00:16:53,067
I'll try not to disappoint you.

304
00:16:57,089 --> 00:17:00,119
No doubt you've heard
the latest news from Bajor.

305
00:17:00,162 --> 00:17:02,999
About the flooding
in the Rakantha Province, yes.

306
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:08,841
There was also an earthquake
in the Kendra Valley last night.

307
00:17:08,883 --> 00:17:12,346
This morning, a tornado
struck Tamulna.

308
00:17:12,392 --> 00:17:15,388
Our sensors indicate
that Bajor has been affected

309
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:17,336
by the instability
of the wormhole.

310
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,737
How comforting.

311
00:17:18,774 --> 00:17:21,645
Tell me, do your sensors
have an explanation

312
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,878
for the instability itself?

313
00:17:25,524 --> 00:17:26,514
No.

314
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,030
Then I'll give you one.

315
00:17:29,066 --> 00:17:33,668
You've angered the Prophets
by taking the tablet from Bajor.

316
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:36,307
As the spiritual leader
of the Bajoran people

317
00:17:36,349 --> 00:17:38,981
I'm asking you to return it.

318
00:17:39,023 --> 00:17:40,720
And as the Emissary
of the Prophets

319
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,631
I will ask you to give me
more time to study it.

320
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:46,765
I believe it is
the will of the Prophets.

321
00:17:46,807 --> 00:17:48,744
Well, I disagree.

322
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:51,012
This is a formal request
from the First Minister

323
00:17:51,051 --> 00:17:53,522
for you to turn over
the relic to me.

324
00:17:53,557 --> 00:17:56,428
You must have been
very persuasive.

325
00:17:56,464 --> 00:17:57,660
This is the first time

326
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:00,367
you and Shakaar
have agreed on anything.

327
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:04,407
If you deny his request,
I promise you

328
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,783
it will damage relations

329
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,090
between Bajor
and the Federation.

330
00:18:14,909 --> 00:18:17,814
The tablet...

331
00:18:17,849 --> 00:18:21,221
will be on its way to Bajor
on the morning transport.

332
00:18:26,336 --> 00:18:28,136
As will I.

333
00:18:35,992 --> 00:18:37,086
You're sending it back?

334
00:18:37,128 --> 00:18:38,825
And I was just
starting to have fun.

335
00:18:38,865 --> 00:18:40,927
I'm not letting you
off the hook, old man.

336
00:18:40,971 --> 00:18:42,634
I need these inscriptions
translated.

337
00:18:42,675 --> 00:18:45,273
I can work off
the holo-recordings

338
00:18:45,314 --> 00:18:46,647
I took yesterday.

339
00:18:46,684 --> 00:18:48,210
Have you made any more progress?

340
00:18:49,358 --> 00:18:50,622
Good news or bad?

341
00:18:50,661 --> 00:18:51,629
That depends.

342
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:52,631
On what?

343
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:53,760
On what this ideogram means.

344
00:18:53,801 --> 00:18:55,635
The computer has given
me two possibilities.

345
00:18:55,673 --> 00:18:56,663
They are?

346
00:18:57,711 --> 00:18:59,305
During the Reckoning

347
00:18:59,382 --> 00:19:01,512
the Bajorans will either
"suffer horribly"

348
00:19:01,553 --> 00:19:03,387
or "eat fruit."

349
00:19:04,995 --> 00:19:06,054
"Eat fruit"?

350
00:19:07,835 --> 00:19:10,637
Given the tone of the rest
of the inscriptions

351
00:19:10,676 --> 00:19:14,082
I would bet
on horrible suffering.

352
00:19:14,117 --> 00:19:15,814
What else do you have?

353
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:17,483
You'll love this.

354
00:19:17,525 --> 00:19:19,119
It's about you.

355
00:19:19,163 --> 00:19:23,162
"Once the Reckoning begins,
the Emissary will..."

356
00:19:24,175 --> 00:19:25,234
Go on.

357
00:19:25,277 --> 00:19:27,271
I was hoping you could tell me.

358
00:19:27,315 --> 00:19:30,049
Well, the rest
of the inscription's damaged.

359
00:19:30,089 --> 00:19:31,524
Oh, that figures.

360
00:19:33,764 --> 00:19:36,201
Oh, I wish the wormhole
would stop doing that.

361
00:19:36,236 --> 00:19:37,204
So do I.

362
00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:38,207
Keep at it, old man.

363
00:19:38,241 --> 00:19:39,767
Just do me one favor.

364
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,337
If you talk
to the Prophets again

365
00:19:41,449 --> 00:19:43,443
ask for a dictionary...

366
00:19:43,488 --> 00:19:45,356
please.

367
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,260
I'll see what I can do.

368
00:19:47,296 --> 00:19:48,424
Thank you.

369
00:19:55,082 --> 00:19:56,985
Captain,
I have a message for you

370
00:19:57,019 --> 00:19:58,386
from General Martok.

371
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:59,584
Go ahead.

372
00:19:59,626 --> 00:20:01,620
He's dispatched
three Klingon attack cruisers

373
00:20:01,664 --> 00:20:04,831
to bolster the defense perimeter
around the Dorala system.

374
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,568
Good.
I just hope they can hold out

375
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:08,773
until Starfleet
sends in reinforcements.

376
00:20:08,815 --> 00:20:11,754
The Klingons will hold out.
Martok will see to it.

377
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:17,258
Long day?

378
00:20:17,302 --> 00:20:19,705
They seem to get longer.

379
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,177
You'll feel better
in the morning...

380
00:20:22,214 --> 00:20:23,911
once the Kai
is off the station.

381
00:20:26,156 --> 00:20:29,254
She may be the spiritual leader
of millions of Bajorans

382
00:20:29,297 --> 00:20:31,268
but she is not an easy woman
to like.

383
00:20:31,301 --> 00:20:32,634
Well, if it's any comfort

384
00:20:32,671 --> 00:20:34,436
I don't think she likes you,
either.

385
00:20:34,476 --> 00:20:36,241
I've known that for a while.

386
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,715
I guess I should have
consulted her

387
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,416
before I brought the artifact
up to the station.

388
00:20:40,457 --> 00:20:42,257
She would have tried
to stop you.

389
00:20:42,295 --> 00:20:44,596
Ah...
that's why I didn't ask her.

390
00:20:44,634 --> 00:20:46,969
In a way, I feel sorry for her.

391
00:20:47,006 --> 00:20:50,378
She spends her whole life
in service to the Prophets.

392
00:20:50,414 --> 00:20:54,185
Then one day, after years
of self-sacrifice and commitment

393
00:20:54,223 --> 00:20:55,522
she gets her reward.

394
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,619
She's elected Kai.

395
00:20:56,663 --> 00:20:59,032
Should've been the greatest
moment of her life.

396
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:05,408
But my being the Emissary
spoiled it for her.

397
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:08,617
Well, the Kai's always been
the spiritual leader of Bajor

398
00:21:08,658 --> 00:21:10,959
but Winn has to share
that role with you

399
00:21:10,997 --> 00:21:12,296
and to make matters worse

400
00:21:12,334 --> 00:21:14,099
you're an outsider,
a non-Bajoran.

401
00:21:14,137 --> 00:21:16,506
That's something she can never
forgive you for.

402
00:21:16,577 --> 00:21:17,978
I guess that's why she made

403
00:21:18,014 --> 00:21:19,745
such an issue
of the whole thing.

404
00:21:19,784 --> 00:21:21,880
Well, she's jealous of you

405
00:21:21,923 --> 00:21:25,489
and of your relationship
with the Prophets.

406
00:21:25,531 --> 00:21:27,399
I'm a little envious myself.

407
00:21:27,436 --> 00:21:29,133
Why?

408
00:21:29,173 --> 00:21:31,440
You speak with the Prophets.

409
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,006
They listen to you.

410
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,815
That's...

411
00:21:34,854 --> 00:21:36,722
that's a rare gift.

412
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:38,730
Certainly nothing I asked for.

413
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:43,264
I guess that's why I don't
resent you, but the Kai does.

414
00:21:45,312 --> 00:21:48,444
I'll keep that in mind.

415
00:22:00,616 --> 00:22:02,712
Is something wrong, Eminence?

416
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:05,988
What makes you say that, child?

417
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,158
You seem troubled.

418
00:22:07,198 --> 00:22:08,428
Not at all.

419
00:22:08,468 --> 00:22:09,801
I am quite relieved

420
00:22:09,838 --> 00:22:13,142
the Emissary has decided
to do the right thing.

421
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,276
Well, you didn't leave him
much choice, did you?

422
00:22:16,387 --> 00:22:19,828
I suppose you think
I enjoyed forcing his hand.

423
00:22:19,862 --> 00:22:23,234
I assure you, I did not.

424
00:22:23,271 --> 00:22:25,869
I wish the situation
had been resolved

425
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:27,346
more amicably.

426
00:22:27,381 --> 00:22:30,183
Perhaps the next time
we have a disagreement

427
00:22:30,221 --> 00:22:32,692
he'll consider my wishes
more thoughtfully.

428
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:33,821
The next time?

429
00:22:33,863 --> 00:22:36,027
You're anticipating
more disagreements?

430
00:22:37,605 --> 00:22:40,669
I merely meant to express
my hope that, in the future

431
00:22:40,712 --> 00:22:42,945
we can work together
for the good of Bajor.

432
00:22:42,985 --> 00:22:44,113
Of course.

433
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:47,218
After all, you are
on the same side, aren't you?

434
00:22:47,261 --> 00:22:49,232
Naturally.

435
00:22:49,266 --> 00:22:51,430
We both serve the Prophets.

436
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:53,668
There is no higher calling.

437
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:05,760
Yes?

438
00:23:07,444 --> 00:23:08,606
Jake-o.

439
00:23:15,796 --> 00:23:17,390
You're up late.

440
00:23:17,434 --> 00:23:19,598
Oh, so are you.

441
00:23:19,639 --> 00:23:20,572
What's on your mind?

442
00:23:21,611 --> 00:23:22,705
I don't know.

443
00:23:22,746 --> 00:23:24,443
I guess I just wanted
to see if you're all right.

444
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,312
I'm fine.

445
00:23:27,358 --> 00:23:29,990
Since when did you
become a worrier?

446
00:23:31,668 --> 00:23:33,228
I don't know.

447
00:23:33,272 --> 00:23:35,972
It's this Emissary stuff.

448
00:23:36,012 --> 00:23:38,142
It scares me a little.

449
00:23:44,866 --> 00:23:46,165
Twice now...

450
00:23:46,203 --> 00:23:48,504
twice in one year...

451
00:23:48,608 --> 00:23:51,809
Dr. Bashir's called me
down to the Infirmary

452
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,753
to tell me something
was wrong with you

453
00:23:53,787 --> 00:23:58,230
and there you were,
lying unconscious on a bio-bed

454
00:23:58,265 --> 00:24:00,395
having visions or something.

455
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:03,636
And there...

456
00:24:03,678 --> 00:24:05,876
all I could do was
just stand there

457
00:24:05,916 --> 00:24:08,980
and, and wonder...

458
00:24:09,024 --> 00:24:10,721
if you were ever
going to wake up.

459
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,340
I know it hasn't been easy,
Jake.

460
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:18,812
I don't want it
to happen again.

461
00:24:22,389 --> 00:24:27,424
You know, I didn't ask
to be the Emissary...

462
00:24:28,638 --> 00:24:32,876
but, for better or worse,
I guess that's what I am...

463
00:24:35,554 --> 00:24:37,388
except for being your dad.

464
00:25:22,801 --> 00:25:28,441
Why do you always have to be
so damned mysterious?

465
00:25:30,318 --> 00:25:32,950
Answer me.

466
00:25:32,992 --> 00:25:35,658
I am tired of your riddles!

467
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:40,834
If there's something
you need me to do, say so!

468
00:26:15,193 --> 00:26:17,187
Let me guess.

469
00:26:17,231 --> 00:26:19,668
You accidentally
knocked it over.

470
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,503
Not exactly.

471
00:26:21,542 --> 00:26:22,875
I didn't think so.

472
00:26:22,912 --> 00:26:25,383
So what did happen?

473
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:29,382
I just had this
uncontrollable urge

474
00:26:29,427 --> 00:26:31,295
to smash the tablet.

475
00:26:31,332 --> 00:26:34,100
Oh, I get those urges
all the time.

476
00:26:34,139 --> 00:26:36,633
Of course, I never act on them.

477
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:41,713
I'm not reading
any residual energy signatures.

478
00:26:41,823 --> 00:26:43,292
That's impossible.

479
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:45,196
Check the station's
internal sensors.

480
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,432
Nothing.

481
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:50,273
I tell you, I saw something.

482
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,836
We believe you, Captain.

483
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,942
Oh, please, Constable,
don't patronize me.

484
00:26:58,062 --> 00:27:00,124
Sisko to Ops.
Report.

485
00:27:00,167 --> 00:27:02,969
We just experienced
a station-wide power drain.

486
00:27:03,008 --> 00:27:04,671
We're attempting
to determine the source.

487
00:27:04,711 --> 00:27:05,701
Keep me informed.

488
00:27:05,748 --> 00:27:06,716
Aye, sir.

489
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:10,555
It's possible
the power drain is related

490
00:27:10,593 --> 00:27:12,894
to this energy discharge
you saw.

491
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:16,029
I'm starting to think
the same thing.

492
00:27:17,442 --> 00:27:21,178
Benjamin, you're not getting
another urge, are you?

493
00:27:21,217 --> 00:27:22,811
No.

494
00:27:25,996 --> 00:27:28,969
I've done what I needed to do.

495
00:27:29,003 --> 00:27:32,239
I know this might sound strange

496
00:27:32,278 --> 00:27:36,277
but I think the Prophets
wanted me to shatter the tablet.

497
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,226
Try explaining that to Kai Winn.

498
00:27:39,261 --> 00:27:41,790
I can't believe
that you'd be so petty

499
00:27:41,867 --> 00:27:45,399
as to destroy the artifact
rather than turn it over to me.

500
00:27:45,442 --> 00:27:47,002
That's not why I did it.

501
00:27:47,047 --> 00:27:50,954
You expect me to believe
that the Prophets wanted you

502
00:27:50,989 --> 00:27:55,056
to destroy a priceless piece
of Bajor's history?

503
00:27:55,099 --> 00:27:57,400
That's exactly
what you have to believe.

504
00:27:57,438 --> 00:28:00,343
And why would they do that?

505
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:02,542
I wish I had an answer for you.

506
00:28:02,583 --> 00:28:05,077
Well, I'm sure you'll
come up with something.

507
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:11,234
You and I haven't always
seen things eye to eye

508
00:28:11,271 --> 00:28:13,139
but we have one thing
in common...

509
00:28:13,176 --> 00:28:14,201
we both believe

510
00:28:14,245 --> 00:28:15,908
that the Prophets
have a plan for Bajor.

511
00:28:15,949 --> 00:28:19,185
Now, sometimes, it's not
easy to see the path

512
00:28:19,224 --> 00:28:20,716
they've laid out for us.

513
00:28:20,761 --> 00:28:25,762
Right now, I don't know
what they want from me

514
00:28:25,806 --> 00:28:27,743
but I'm willing
to take a leap of faith

515
00:28:27,778 --> 00:28:29,372
and trust
that they're guiding me

516
00:28:29,415 --> 00:28:31,682
and I'm asking you
to take that leap with me.

517
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,126
There's no need
for a leap of faith, Emissary.

518
00:28:35,162 --> 00:28:37,794
The Prophets have
made it quite clear.

519
00:28:37,835 --> 00:28:40,102
Two-thirds of
the Rakantha wheat harvest

520
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,871
have been destroyed by floods.

521
00:28:41,911 --> 00:28:44,884
Earthquakes have devastated
Kendra Province

522
00:28:44,952 --> 00:28:46,889
leaving hundreds homeless.

523
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:50,431
Bajorans are suffering
because of you.

524
00:28:50,465 --> 00:28:54,133
They're paying the price
for your act of sacrilege.

525
00:28:55,898 --> 00:28:57,869
Odo to Captain Sisko.

526
00:28:57,903 --> 00:28:59,566
Go ahead.

527
00:28:59,607 --> 00:29:01,737
You'd better come down
to the Promenade, sir.

528
00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:03,043
Is there a problem?

529
00:29:03,082 --> 00:29:04,882
I'll let you
be the judge of that.

530
00:29:17,216 --> 00:29:20,314
I think we've found the source
of the power fluctuations.

531
00:29:20,423 --> 00:29:23,089
When I tried to talk
to her, she ignored me.

532
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:49,787
You...

533
00:29:49,827 --> 00:29:51,296
are the Sisko.

534
00:29:52,534 --> 00:29:55,336
Keep your hands
off your weapons.

535
00:29:55,374 --> 00:29:56,570
It's a Prophet.

536
00:29:58,047 --> 00:30:00,348
Why have you taken
this woman's body?

537
00:30:00,386 --> 00:30:03,120
This vessel is willing.

538
00:30:05,131 --> 00:30:07,329
The Reckoning...

539
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:08,930
it is time.

540
00:30:16,992 --> 00:30:19,556
The Reckoning... what is it?

541
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:21,627
The end...

542
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,299
or the beginning.

543
00:30:23,341 --> 00:30:24,776
I don't understand.

544
00:30:26,916 --> 00:30:29,480
I await Kosst Amojan.

545
00:30:29,523 --> 00:30:31,357
The Evil One.

546
00:30:31,393 --> 00:30:33,387
A Pah-wraith

547
00:30:33,432 --> 00:30:35,699
banished
from the Celestial Temple.

548
00:30:35,737 --> 00:30:37,708
You're saying a Pah-wraith

549
00:30:37,742 --> 00:30:40,179
will take corporeal form
as well?

550
00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:42,015
The battle will be joined.

551
00:30:42,052 --> 00:30:45,184
This battle...
is it to be fought here?

552
00:30:45,227 --> 00:30:47,198
Bajor will be reborn.

553
00:30:48,134 --> 00:30:50,537
Shabren's Fifth Prophecy...

554
00:30:50,639 --> 00:30:52,667
the Rebirth.

555
00:30:52,711 --> 00:30:54,340
If the Evil One is destroyed

556
00:30:54,382 --> 00:30:56,853
it will bring a thousand years
of peace...

557
00:30:56,888 --> 00:31:00,830
the Golden Age of Bajor.

558
00:31:01,933 --> 00:31:03,733
If it is destroyed?

559
00:31:05,442 --> 00:31:08,040
Who will prevail is not known.

560
00:31:08,082 --> 00:31:09,676
What do you want from me?

561
00:31:09,719 --> 00:31:12,419
Am I supposed
to help you in some way?

562
00:31:12,459 --> 00:31:16,629
The Sisko
has completed his task.

563
00:31:19,776 --> 00:31:21,940
Forgive my blindness.

564
00:31:24,621 --> 00:31:26,489
Prophet, hear me.

565
00:31:26,525 --> 00:31:28,996
I am the Kai of Bajor.

566
00:31:29,032 --> 00:31:33,566
I offer myself to you
as your humble servant.

567
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:35,875
I await their vessel.

568
00:31:36,984 --> 00:31:37,952
Speak to me.

569
00:31:37,986 --> 00:31:40,584
Tell me what I should do.

570
00:31:50,918 --> 00:31:52,718
We're evacuating.

571
00:31:52,755 --> 00:31:55,158
You can't be serious.

572
00:31:55,195 --> 00:31:57,598
This battle could
destroy the station.

573
00:31:57,634 --> 00:31:59,103
Then don't let it
be fought here.

574
00:31:59,137 --> 00:32:01,540
I don't have any choice.

575
00:32:01,576 --> 00:32:02,704
Yes, you do.

576
00:32:02,746 --> 00:32:06,050
We can flood the Promenade
with chroniton radiation.

577
00:32:06,087 --> 00:32:08,422
Are you suggesting
that we kill a Prophet?

578
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:09,518
I won't do that.

579
00:32:09,562 --> 00:32:11,191
You don't have to.

580
00:32:11,233 --> 00:32:13,933
If you ramp up
the chroniton levels slowly

581
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,602
you'll give the wormhole alien
a chance to leave

582
00:32:15,643 --> 00:32:17,511
Kira's body
without getting hurt.

583
00:32:17,548 --> 00:32:19,849
We have everything rigged
and ready to go.

584
00:32:19,887 --> 00:32:21,379
Just say the word.

585
00:32:25,667 --> 00:32:27,034
No.

586
00:32:27,071 --> 00:32:28,199
Benjamin.

587
00:32:29,777 --> 00:32:31,110
Deep Space 9 is critical

588
00:32:31,147 --> 00:32:32,947
to the defense
of the Federation.

589
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:34,476
We cannot risk destroying it.

590
00:32:34,522 --> 00:32:35,650
When the Dominion fleet

591
00:32:35,758 --> 00:32:37,523
was about to come
through the wormhole

592
00:32:37,563 --> 00:32:40,331
I asked the Prophets
for their help.

593
00:32:40,369 --> 00:32:41,599
They gave it to me.

594
00:32:41,638 --> 00:32:43,768
Now they're asking for my help.

595
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:46,681
They need to fight this
battle here, now.

596
00:32:46,785 --> 00:32:49,188
I'm not going
to jeopardize my crew

597
00:32:49,224 --> 00:32:51,092
but I'm not going

598
00:32:51,129 --> 00:32:53,464
to stand in the way
of the Prophets, either.

599
00:32:53,501 --> 00:32:55,198
What if the Prophets lose?

600
00:32:55,238 --> 00:32:57,436
Are you willing
to sacrifice Kira?

601
00:32:57,477 --> 00:33:00,609
The Prophet said she was willing
to be their instrument.

602
00:33:00,651 --> 00:33:02,052
And you believe that?

603
00:33:02,088 --> 00:33:02,953
I do.

604
00:33:06,198 --> 00:33:08,669
I know how important
her faith is to her

605
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:13,112
and... I have no doubt that
she would allow the Prophets

606
00:33:13,148 --> 00:33:15,642
to use her as their instrument.

607
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:22,199
I'll notify Starfleet that
we're abandoning the station.

608
00:33:22,236 --> 00:33:25,004
Begin the evacuation
immediately.

609
00:33:37,607 --> 00:33:39,942
Hurry along, now.
Hurry along.

610
00:33:39,979 --> 00:33:41,038
Is this transport full?

611
00:33:41,082 --> 00:33:42,141
There's room.

612
00:33:42,184 --> 00:33:44,485
I'm going to check the
Promenade for stragglers.

613
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,359
Odo, you should've helped us

614
00:33:47,396 --> 00:33:48,888
persuade the Captain
to end this.

615
00:33:48,934 --> 00:33:51,064
I had to respect Kira's wishes.

616
00:33:51,106 --> 00:33:54,011
If it were Dax, I am not sure
I could've done the same.

617
00:33:54,046 --> 00:33:55,014
Well, just be grateful

618
00:33:55,048 --> 00:33:56,677
you didn't have
to make that choice.

619
00:33:58,188 --> 00:34:01,161
For your sake, I hope
the Prophets are victorious.

620
00:34:01,196 --> 00:34:02,290
They will be

621
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:04,394
if Kira has anything
to do with it.

622
00:34:06,442 --> 00:34:07,570
Come on.

623
00:34:10,485 --> 00:34:11,475
Report.

624
00:34:11,521 --> 00:34:12,922
We expect to be down
to a skeleton crew

625
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:13,926
within the hour.

626
00:34:13,961 --> 00:34:15,191
Very well.

627
00:34:15,229 --> 00:34:16,630
What did Starfleet have to say?

628
00:34:16,666 --> 00:34:18,033
I managed to convince them

629
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:20,234
that we couldn't afford
to defy the Prophets.

630
00:34:20,275 --> 00:34:22,269
They are the only thing
that's keeping the Dominion

631
00:34:22,313 --> 00:34:23,782
from coming
through the wormhole.

632
00:34:23,883 --> 00:34:25,683
The only problem is,
there's no guarantee

633
00:34:25,722 --> 00:34:27,316
the Prophets will win
this battle.

634
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,327
Odo to Sisko.

635
00:34:28,362 --> 00:34:30,196
Go ahead, Constable.

636
00:34:30,232 --> 00:34:31,792
Captain, there's a group
of Bajorans

637
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,033
on the Promenade
who are refusing to leave.

638
00:34:36,614 --> 00:34:42,151
<i>Tera dak embah</i>
<i>ihsehelm ran embah...</i>

639
00:34:42,194 --> 00:34:44,461
<i>de-ram ta-meen.</i>

640
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,941
<i>Tera dak ihsehelm</i>

641
00:34:47,975 --> 00:34:50,003
<i>ran embah...</i>

642
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:52,109
<i>de-ram ta-meen...</i>

643
00:34:52,152 --> 00:34:54,146
The last transports
are standing by.

644
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:58,530
<i>Tera dak ihsehelm</i>
<i>ran embah...</i>

645
00:34:58,567 --> 00:35:00,059
Eminence.

646
00:35:00,104 --> 00:35:01,596
<i>... ta-meen.</i>

647
00:35:03,512 --> 00:35:04,606
Emissary.

648
00:35:04,648 --> 00:35:06,585
These people have to go.

649
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:10,423
We're offering prayers
for the Prophets' victory.

650
00:35:10,463 --> 00:35:12,331
The Prophets will hear
your prayers

651
00:35:12,366 --> 00:35:13,334
wherever you are.

652
00:35:13,369 --> 00:35:15,032
It isn't safe here.

653
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:19,015
Then why are you still here,
Emissary?

654
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,989
The Prophet told you
your task was done.

655
00:35:22,023 --> 00:35:23,857
I am Captain of this station

656
00:35:23,961 --> 00:35:26,398
and I will do everything
in my power to save it.

657
00:35:26,434 --> 00:35:29,373
Now, are you going to
tell these people to go

658
00:35:29,407 --> 00:35:31,640
or shall I?

659
00:35:35,923 --> 00:35:37,415
My children

660
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,590
the Prophets have
heard your prayers.

661
00:35:39,632 --> 00:35:41,124
You must go.

662
00:35:44,744 --> 00:35:46,738
Take them to the transports.

663
00:35:48,754 --> 00:35:50,657
All right, this way.

664
00:35:50,692 --> 00:35:53,290
Congratulations, Emissary.

665
00:35:53,331 --> 00:35:55,829
Thanks to you the Prophets'
victory is at hand.

666
00:35:55,963 --> 00:35:57,227
I hope you're right.

667
00:35:57,267 --> 00:35:59,933
Where is your faith,
Emissary?

668
00:35:59,973 --> 00:36:03,243
You don't think the Evil One
will be victorious, do you?

669
00:36:04,617 --> 00:36:08,251
Rest assured...
the Golden Age is upon us.

670
00:36:08,293 --> 00:36:11,734
The Prophets and the people
will be as one.

671
00:36:11,768 --> 00:36:13,932
Think of it.

672
00:36:13,973 --> 00:36:17,436
There will be no need
for vedeks or kais

673
00:36:17,481 --> 00:36:19,349
or even Emissaries.

674
00:36:22,995 --> 00:36:25,991
Kosst Amojan
has chosen its vessel.

675
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:39,894
Let it begin.

676
00:36:47,821 --> 00:36:51,284
Leave my son
and take me instead!

677
00:36:52,867 --> 00:36:55,533
Your Emissary
offers himself to us.

678
00:36:56,842 --> 00:36:58,334
His faith wavers.

679
00:37:38,943 --> 00:37:40,937
Emissary, we must go.

680
00:37:51,974 --> 00:37:52,942
Benjamin

681
00:37:52,977 --> 00:37:54,469
Worf is standing by in Ops.

682
00:37:54,514 --> 00:37:56,143
He can trigger
the chroniton generator

683
00:37:56,185 --> 00:37:57,415
at your command.

684
00:37:57,454 --> 00:37:58,582
You can still end this, Ben.

685
00:37:58,624 --> 00:38:00,116
No, I've got to play
this thing out.

686
00:38:00,161 --> 00:38:01,790
That is your son out there.

687
00:38:01,831 --> 00:38:03,027
Don't you think I know that?!

688
00:38:03,068 --> 00:38:04,799
The Prophets will protect him.

689
00:38:04,838 --> 00:38:06,398
They're trying to kill him.

690
00:38:06,443 --> 00:38:08,880
No. They're trying
to destroy the Pah-wraith.

691
00:38:08,915 --> 00:38:11,683
The Prophets will not let
anything happen to him.

692
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:12,986
How do you know that?

693
00:38:13,025 --> 00:38:14,392
I know.

694
00:38:16,734 --> 00:38:18,226
We've got to get out of here.

695
00:38:18,271 --> 00:38:19,604
According to the sensors,
the energy

696
00:38:19,641 --> 00:38:22,409
building between them
could explode at any second.

697
00:38:22,448 --> 00:38:24,213
I'm not going
to leave Jake here.

698
00:38:26,423 --> 00:38:27,585
We must go, Emissary.

699
00:38:27,627 --> 00:38:28,857
Benjamin...

700
00:38:28,896 --> 00:38:29,864
Get out of here!

701
00:38:29,898 --> 00:38:31,595
Get off the station,
both of you!

702
00:38:31,637 --> 00:38:32,627
That's an order!

703
00:38:32,739 --> 00:38:34,436
Come, child. We must go.

704
00:38:42,796 --> 00:38:43,992
Dax to Worf.

705
00:38:47,841 --> 00:38:48,900
Go ahead.

706
00:38:48,944 --> 00:38:50,311
Meet me in Airlock 8.

707
00:38:50,348 --> 00:38:51,510
We're leaving.

708
00:38:55,226 --> 00:38:56,194
Go on ahead.

709
00:38:56,228 --> 00:38:57,561
Airlock 8 is down to the right.

710
00:38:58,635 --> 00:39:01,199
This way.
Move quickly.

711
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,302
Let's go.
Come on.

712
00:39:03,346 --> 00:39:04,336
Hurry up.

713
00:39:04,382 --> 00:39:06,478
It's okay, it's okay.

714
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,080
I think the transport
is down here.

715
00:39:33,284 --> 00:39:35,380
No!

716
00:39:36,425 --> 00:39:39,695
Chroniton levels
at 37 percent and rising.

717
00:39:41,336 --> 00:39:43,500
May the Prophets forgive me.

718
00:40:07,399 --> 00:40:08,891
Jake...

719
00:40:17,256 --> 00:40:19,922
Captain's Log, supplemental.

720
00:40:19,962 --> 00:40:21,693
The station's population
has returned

721
00:40:21,734 --> 00:40:23,932
and repairs are underway.

722
00:40:23,972 --> 00:40:27,036
Major Kira has recovered
from her experience...

723
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:30,315
but my son is still
in the Infirmary.

724
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,757
Jake?

725
00:40:32,793 --> 00:40:34,524
He'll be, uh, laid
up for a few days

726
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:35,693
but he'll be all right.

727
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:36,701
May I see him?

728
00:40:36,736 --> 00:40:37,830
Oh, yes.

729
00:40:45,557 --> 00:40:46,787
Jake...

730
00:40:50,001 --> 00:40:51,026
Dad.

731
00:40:51,071 --> 00:40:52,974
How are you feeling?

732
00:40:54,111 --> 00:40:55,911
Could be worse.

733
00:40:57,419 --> 00:40:59,788
You'll be up and about
in no time.

734
00:41:02,732 --> 00:41:05,226
I don't know what to say.

735
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,268
Say you're happy to see me.

736
00:41:08,312 --> 00:41:10,283
You know I am.

737
00:41:12,856 --> 00:41:14,450
I wish I...

738
00:41:16,665 --> 00:41:20,607
I want to explain
what happened...

739
00:41:20,641 --> 00:41:22,874
but I'm not sure that I can.

740
00:41:24,918 --> 00:41:27,914
You don't have to explain.

741
00:41:27,958 --> 00:41:31,262
When the Pah-wraith
was inside me

742
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,864
I could feel its hatred

743
00:41:33,907 --> 00:41:37,746
and I knew that no matter what

744
00:41:37,782 --> 00:41:41,884
it couldn't be allowed to win...

745
00:41:41,926 --> 00:41:45,024
even if it meant I had to die.

746
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:49,208
You did the right thing.

747
00:42:02,107 --> 00:42:03,872
How was the prayer service?

748
00:42:03,912 --> 00:42:04,937
To tell you the truth

749
00:42:05,047 --> 00:42:06,812
I didn't pay
that much attention.

750
00:42:06,852 --> 00:42:10,156
I'm still trying to make sense
out of everything that happened.

751
00:42:10,193 --> 00:42:12,391
I mean, of all the people
on this station

752
00:42:12,431 --> 00:42:14,196
the Prophets chose me.

753
00:42:14,236 --> 00:42:18,235
I'm not sure I know
why I deserve that honor.

754
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,183
Perhaps that's why
you were chosen.

755
00:42:20,217 --> 00:42:21,777
You have faith and humility.

756
00:42:21,822 --> 00:42:23,622
I heard that you
told the Captain

757
00:42:23,659 --> 00:42:26,257
that I was willing to give
my life to serve the Prophets.

758
00:42:26,299 --> 00:42:29,933
I appreciate that you
respect my beliefs.

759
00:42:30,943 --> 00:42:33,312
Just the same,
I wouldn't have minded

760
00:42:33,349 --> 00:42:35,513
if the Prophets
had chosen someone else.

761
00:42:37,926 --> 00:42:39,395
I have to go.

762
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:41,230
I'll drop by Security

763
00:42:41,268 --> 00:42:43,068
after I take the Kai
to her shuttle.

764
00:42:52,595 --> 00:42:55,534
The Emissary couldn't
escort me himself?

765
00:42:55,569 --> 00:42:56,868
He's with his son.

766
00:42:56,906 --> 00:42:59,275
I would think
he'd want to thank me.

767
00:42:59,311 --> 00:43:00,780
For what?

768
00:43:00,814 --> 00:43:04,482
I prevented the destruction
of this station.

769
00:43:04,523 --> 00:43:09,194
I saved the Emissary's life
and the life of his son.

770
00:43:09,235 --> 00:43:11,706
Don't pretend you did
it for the Captain.

771
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:13,300
I did it for Bajor.

772
00:43:13,345 --> 00:43:16,443
If you haven't heard,
the floodwaters have receded

773
00:43:16,485 --> 00:43:18,547
and the earthquakes
have stopped.

774
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:21,928
And you're going
to take credit for that?

775
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:24,996
I take it as a sign
I did the right thing.

776
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:27,033
You defied the will
of the Prophets

777
00:43:27,078 --> 00:43:30,176
and you did it
because you couldn't stand

778
00:43:30,218 --> 00:43:32,416
the fact that a human,
an infidel

779
00:43:32,457 --> 00:43:35,624
had a stronger faith than you.

780
00:43:35,665 --> 00:43:38,297
The Emissary was willing
to sacrifice his own son

781
00:43:38,338 --> 00:43:39,830
to serve the Prophets.

782
00:43:39,875 --> 00:43:43,475
My faith is as pure
as the Emissary's.

783
00:43:44,686 --> 00:43:48,525
I think you're confusing
faith with ambition.

784
00:43:48,562 --> 00:43:52,367
I'm not confusing anything,
child, you are.

785
00:43:52,405 --> 00:43:55,537
The Prophets chose you
as their instrument.

786
00:43:55,579 --> 00:43:58,575
That doesn't mean
you can speak for them.

787
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:02,722
Because of your interference,
the Reckoning was stopped.

788
00:44:02,763 --> 00:44:04,927
The evil still exists.

789
00:44:04,968 --> 00:44:07,941
And I'm not sure
if even the Prophets know

790
00:44:07,975 --> 00:44:10,539
what that will mean for Bajor.
