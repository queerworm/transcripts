(<i> thunder cracks</i> )

2
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:08,300
I didn't kill him, you know.

3
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:12,930
A lot of people
believed it was me.

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,098
That shape-shifter thought so.

5
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,350
But he was wrong.

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,102
It was a long time ago.

7
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:23,064
Say what you will
about the Cardassians,

8
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:25,024
at least they could keep
the power on.

9
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,153
Would you like more ice?

10
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:29,237
I'm fine.

11
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:30,906
You were
always very kind.

12
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:32,073
Was I?

13
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:34,075
You made life
a little easier.

14
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:36,119
I ran a black market
for anyone who could pay.

15
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,539
Never exactly thought
of myself as "kind."

16
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,708
There was always
that little extra ginger tea

17
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,710
in that package you gave me,
wasn't there?

18
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,005
You didn't call me to
Bajor to talk about tea.

19
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:48,674
No.

20
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:51,343
I need a favor.

21
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:52,469
For old
times' sake?

22
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,679
That's right.

23
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:54,805
I'm still as
kind as ever.

24
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:55,764
I can pay you.

25
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,432
I'm listening.

26
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:59,768
My husband kept a strongbox
in our shop on the station

27
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,645
buried in the wall.

28
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:03,146
I want you to bring it to me.

29
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,272
What's in it?

30
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:06,025
Nothing anyone would value.

31
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:07,359
Anyone but you.

32
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,986
Sentimental reasons.

33
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:11,655
Why not take a sentimental
journey back to the station?

34
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,032
If it's your property.

35
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:15,283
I couldn't stand
being back in that shop

36
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:17,118
where my husband was murdered.

37
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:21,331
Or maybe you'd rather not
let Odo see you there.

38
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:25,502
I'm sure he's forgotten
all about that by now.

39
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,879
(<i> laughs</i>
<i>mirthlessly</i> )

40
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:29,423
Can you neutralize
the security system?

41
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:35,470
It's behind the paneled wall
on the left as you enter.

42
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,765
Four panels in, five up.

43
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:40,267
Four in...

44
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:42,227
five up.

45
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:45,731
And I can pay you
five bars of latinum.

46
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,482
Five?

47
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,568
And, as always, my...

48
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,653
personal gratitude.

49
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:01,246
A day...

50
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,123
maybe two.

51
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,876

<i>The reason for this exercise</i>

57
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,456
<i>except perhaps that humans</i>
<i>have a compulsion</i>

58
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:52,584
<i>to keep records</i>

59
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:55,420
<i>so many, in fact, that</i>

60
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,257

61
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:02,761
<i>Otherwise, their records would</i>

62

<i>End log.</i>

67
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,406
Now, when we get
to the entrance,

68
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,699
you stay flat
against the wall.

69
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,659
Uh-huh.

70
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:26,868
It's a pulsatel lockseal.

71
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,536
I can get it to release
in 25 seconds.

72
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,664
25 seconds? But
somebody will see us.

73
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:31,748
Let<i> me</i> do it.

74
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:35,085
You? We'd be at it
all night.

75
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:39,422
All night?

76
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,592
No, only about
ten seconds.

77
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,136
How would you get
a pulsatel lockseal

78
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:45,971
to release
in ten seconds?

79
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:48,015
You have one on
the storeroom door.

80
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:49,599
So?

81
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,269
Sometimes, when you forget
to leave me the desealer,

82
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:53,937
I have to get
the storeroom open.

83
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:56,439
You've unsealed the storeroom
without my knowledge?

84
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,108
Only to serve
a customer's needs.

85
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,109
In ten seconds?

86
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,028
You forget fairly often.

87
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,321
Ten seconds...

88
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:06,783
We'll see how you handle
the desealing rod.

89
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,367
That's all right,
I have my own.

90
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,536
What?

91
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:10,912
Nog made it for me.

92
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,998
Boy's always been
clever with his hands.

93
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:14,166
My storeroom...

94
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,001
Time this, brother.

95
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:17,711
You'll be very proud.

96
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:24,759
There, you see?

97
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,181
Thief! Don't deny it.

98
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:30,598
You've been
stealing from me.

99
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:31,725
Brother, I never...

100
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:32,934
Tomorrow morning,

101
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,769
I'm changing my
entire lock system.

102
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,904
Four in...

103
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,156
five up.

104
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:49,368
Here, it's
behind this one.

105
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:50,744
Keep an eye on
the Promenade

106
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,704
while I burn off
the panel.

107
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:53,955
The glare could
attract attention.

108
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:54,915
I have a better idea.

109
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,457
A better idea?

110
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,876
I took the liberty
of bringing along

111
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,669
a small vial
of magnasite drops.

112
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:00,628
Magnasite drops?

113
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,047
What are magnasite drops?

114
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,215
A compound
that will eat

115
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:04,674
through duranium.

116
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,177
One on each corner
and the panel will fall off.

117
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,595
How do you know that?

118
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:11,472
When you were in the
Gamma Quadrant overnight,

119
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,725
we did very good business.

120
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,852
Naturally, I had to keep
your profits safe,

121
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,229
but you had the only key

122
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:18,605
to the latinum
floor vault.

123
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,315
You got into
my latinum floor vault?

124
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:21,400
With that?

125
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:25,946
(<i> thunk</i> )

126
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:28,990
I didn't want to tell you

127
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,200
because then
you'd know

128
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,826
I burnt off
your floor plates.

129
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,079
But I replaced them out
of my own salary, brother.

130
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,039
My vault...

131
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,083
Should I take it
out for you?

132
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,418
Don't touch it!

133
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:41,378
Don't you touch anything

134
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,588
ever, ever again.

135
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,401
Just a piece of paper?

136
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,445
A treasure map,
perhaps?

137
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,657
What does it
mean, brother?

138
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:13,034
I have no idea.

139
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:17,580
Eight names,
all of them Bajoran.

140
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,082
I want to get
a picture of this list

141
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,583
before I reseal
the box.

142
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,876
Go, get me an imager.

143
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,295
Go!

144

(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

145
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,484
You can't be in here--
we're closed.

146
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:49,237
Well, if you really
<i>want</i> a drink...

147
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,285

148
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:58,372
She knew you couldn't resist
opening it.

149
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,125
I'm sorry.

150
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:04,752
Yeah...

151
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,338
me, too.

Brother?

155

Brother!

156
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:24,814
Help!

157
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,649
Somebody, help!

158
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,694
My brother's been killed!

Ten cc's of cortolin.

I want an antigrav
lift in here, stat!

161
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,037
Ready the cortical
stimulator.

162
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:39,996
What kind of weapon?

163
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,664
I am waiting
for an answer!

164
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,375
ODO:
Whatever it was had
to get by the scanners.

165
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,919
My best guess is a compressed
tetryon beam weapon.

166
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,921
Okay, okay, that's
consistent with
what I'm seeing.

167
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:48,922
Get the stimulator
over here.

168
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:49,923

00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,466
Thoracic cavity
rupture

extensive neural trauma.

171
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,344
Now.

172
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,720
(<i> steady tone sounds</i> )

173
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,138
Rom says it was
a robbery.

174
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,515
Was anything
taken?

175
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,683
He says he doesn't
know, but he knows.

176
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,394
Security's stopping
everyone at the airlocks,

177
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:04,104
but it took them five minutes
to get into position.

178
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,188
The assailant

179
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,689
may already<i> be</i> on a ship.

180
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,108
Delay all outgoing
vessels as long as you can.

181
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,692
Advise their respective
security details.

182

We've got to get him
to the surgery.

183
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,904
Help me get
him up here.

184
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:13,863
I got him.

185
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,115
Easy now.
Slide him in.

186
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,157
All right.

187
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,200
Watch his head.

188
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,829
He's dying, isn't he?

189
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,290
He's dying.

190
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,375
What am I going to do
if my brother dies?

191
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,127
Do? Oh, you'll
have a lot to do

192
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,754
once this place is yours.

193
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:30,922
But if he dies...

194
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:32,424
Mine?

195
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:34,842
"Wives serve, brothers inherit."

196
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:38,305
Rule of Acquisition Number 139,
if I'm not mistaken.

197
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:39,722
I hadn't thought of that.

198
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,099
Really?

199
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:44,269
I had, because it's
a solid motive for murder.

200
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,895
Yes, actually.

201
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:49,649
I have heard of a few
untimely deaths that seemed...

202
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:52,527
Wait a minute.

203
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,529
You're not suggesting
that I...

204
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,615
I've had my eye on you
for a long time, Rom.

205
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:58,699
You're not as stupid
as you look.

206
00:10:58,699 --> 00:10:59,826
I am, too.

207
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:00,952
I would never...

208
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,162
Constable, it's
his own brother.

209
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,163
My own brother.

210
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,414
I hardly...

211
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,457
Stay out of this,
Commander.

212
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:06,666
I know these Ferengi.

213
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,917
They'd sell their
own flesh and blood

214
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,461
for a Cardassian
groat.

215
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:11,171
Odo, he's a family friend.

216
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,964
His son is very close
to my boy.

217
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,341
Well, you'd better
tell his son

218
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,217
that dad's going
to the lunar prison

219
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,596
on Meldrar I--
200 degrees in the shade.

220
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,640
I didn't!
It's not true!

221
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,724
Oh...

222
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,435
Irony of ironies.

223
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,103
I finally
get the bar,

224
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,564
and I'm falsely
accused of my
brother's murder.

225
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,191
Rom...

226
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,109
as a friend

227
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,987
if you know anything
that might be helpful,

228
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,156
I think you
should tell us.

229
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,574
It was a list.

230
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:43,828
The man who shot my
brother stole a list.

231
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,746
What kind of list?

232
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,499
Of names...

233
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,376
eight Bajoran names.

234
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,878
It was in this box
we... we found.

235
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,712
Found?

236
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,965
In a manner
of speaking.

237
00:11:57,676 --> 00:12:00,719
My brother was hired by someone
on Bajor to retrieve it.

238
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:01,762
Who?

239
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:02,930
He didn't tell me.

240
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,224
He never
told me anything.

241
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,476
I tried so hard
to earn Quark's trust.

242
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,603
Now he's dead, and I can
never earn his trust.

243
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:10,522
Just his share
of the profits.

244
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,399
I swear I don't know
who hired him.

245
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,733
All I know is that
the box had been
hidden years ago.

246
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,194
How many years ago?

247
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:19,656
I'm not sure... when the
Cardassians were here.

248
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,075
When the ship's store used
to be the chemist's shop.

249
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:25,328
The chemist's shop?

250
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:26,538
That's right.

251
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,543
Here? This is where
you found the box?

252
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:33,336
Behind a duranium
wall panel.

253
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:34,962
I'll show you
which one.

254
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,215
Do you want me
to open it?

255
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,092
I can do it
in ten seconds.

256
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:56,067
You asked
to see me?

257
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,445
Yes... yes,
please come in.

258
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:03,032
I'm Gul Dukat.
We've met before.

259
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,492
Have we?

260
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,868
I wouldn't expect you
to remember.

261
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,705
I was one of the guests
at the reception

262
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:11,291
at the Bajoran Center
for Science.

263
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,376
It must have been two years ago.

264
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,503
Ah, yes...

265
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,715
when the Cardassian High
Command was invited to...

266
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:19,840
view me.

267
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,925
(<i> chuckles</i> )

268
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,761
You were very amusing
that night.

269
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:23,928
Was I?

270
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:27,390
Yes... you did a
Cardassian neck trick.

271
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,392
Brought the house down.

272
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,728
The Bajoran scientist
who worked with me

273
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:34,021
thought you might
find it entertaining.

274
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,691
He made me practice
for weeks on the...

275
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:38,443
Cardassian neck trick.

276
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,987
Gul Hadar couldn't
stop talking about it.

277
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:45,283
He wanted to send you out
to entertain the troops.

278
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:48,035
I, on the other hand,
began to wonder

279
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,912
if you couldn't provide

280
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:53,708
a more valuable service
for the Cardassian Empire.

281
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,421
I've stayed informed
about you, Odo,

282
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:00,423
ever since you walked out

283
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,342
on your Bajoran keepers.

284
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:05,261
I simply felt I could learn
more outside a laboratory.

285
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,639
Yes, you've become
quite the student

286
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,890
of humanoid nature,
haven't you?

287
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:14,145
Just what is it
you need, Gul Dukat?

288
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:16,523
Have you ever seen
a dead man before?

289
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,940
Yes.

290
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,651
In your mines.

291
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,986
Oh, those are casualties.

292
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,532
This...

293
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,371
is murder.

294
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:35,500
And I've decided
you're going to investigate it.

295
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,210
Me?

296
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,628
Why me?

297
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,087
I'm no investigator.

298
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:44,925
Ah, but I suspect
you'd make a good one.

299
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:48,722
Shape-shifting your way into
places the rest of us can't go.

300
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:53,768
I have no intention of being
a Cardassian agent.

301
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,772
Not an agent.

302
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:59,357
An investigator.

303
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:00,650
There's a difference?

304
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,068
We can't have

305
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,862
these Bajorans running around

306
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:06,740
murdering each other,
now, can we?

307
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,950
I'm talking about order here,
justice.

308
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,536
There's very little justice

309
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:13,954
in the Cardassian
occupation of Bajor.

310
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,207
Don't push me, Odo.

311
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:22,129
My superiors would have me
"solve" this murder

312
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:27,343
by rounding up ten Bajorans
at random and executing them.

313
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:33,892
I'm hoping you'll give me
a better alternative.

314
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,775
Now, these Bajorans
won't talk to us,

315
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,401
but they seem to trust you.

316
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:46,905
I understand you used to
sort out petty disputes

317
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:48,489
concerning
food, blankets,

318
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,074
everyday
sorts of things.

319
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,659
They come to you.

320
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,662
I suppose I'm considered
a neutral observer.

321
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,498
Of course...
you're not one of them.

322
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,585
And for that,
you should be thankful.

323
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,462
So...

324
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:06,132
here's one more petty dispute.

325
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,217
Only this time...

326
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,429
<i>I'm</i> bringing it to you.

327
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,389
Find the murderer.

328
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:17,685
(<i> sighs</i> )

329
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,190
Are there
any witnesses?

330
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:33,660
I'm sorry to keep you
waiting, Mrs. Vaatrik.

331
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,661
This is Odo.

332
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:35,787
He'll be
investigating

333
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:37,705
your husband's
death.

334
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:41,292
Perhaps you two
already know each other.

335
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,419
Have you been
into the shop?

336
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,088
No, I don't
use chemicals.

337
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,549
I've assigned
this space to you.

338
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:51,093
We'll get you
anything you need.

339
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,847
Madam, my sympathies.

340
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,182
Good hunting.

341
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:06,734
I'm sorry
for your loss.

342
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:07,986
Thank you.

343
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,366
Do you...

344
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:16,076
have any idea who
might have done this?

345
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:18,037
I have
a very good idea.

346
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,205
You do?

347
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,207
May I be honest with you?

348
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,751
That might be helpful.

349
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:26,880
My husband was having an affair.

350
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:33,344
Some girl showed up on the
station a couple of weeks ago.

351
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:36,096
He became infatuated with her,
I don't know.

352
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:39,017
Why are men like that?

353
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,520
Believe me, I have no idea.

354
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,648
We had two wonderful years
together...

355
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,984
until she arrived.

356
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,318
And now...

357
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,904
You loved him
very much.

358
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,238
Of course I did.

359
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,032
Then perhaps you could
explain something

360
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:55,408
I don't understand.

361
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,826
What's that?

362
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:58,745
Mr. Vaatrik was found dead
two hours ago.

363
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:01,163
Mrs. Vaatrik
hasn't shed a tear.

364
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,832
What makes you think...

365
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:03,875
By necessity

366
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,877
I'm an observer, Mrs. Vaatrik.

367
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:07,420
When a humanoid cries,

368
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,130
the epidermis below the eyes
swells noticeably.

369
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,258
Your epidermis is
perfectly normal.

370
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:16,054
I've been too angry to cry...
I, I... the shock...

371
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:17,889
Of course.

372
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:19,807
So...

373
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,060
you were about
to accuse

374
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,478
this other woman of the murder,
I believe.

375
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,065
He confessed
his indiscretion
to me days ago,

376
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:28,232
but said it was over.

377
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,609
And when he broke
it off with her,

378
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,360
she killed him
in a jealous rage.

379
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,612
Something like that.

380
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:33,821
Do you know
her name?

381
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:37,408
No, but I can point her
out to you.

382
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,159
Move along.

383
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,955
Step back from the gate.

384
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,081
All of you.

385
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,793
That's enough.

386
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,712
P.A.:
Attention.

387
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:52,256
All bio-organic materials

388
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:56,427
must be disposed of
according to regulations.

389
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:58,930
When was the last time
you saw Mr. Vaatrik alive?

390
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,598
At dinner.

391
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,141
He went back to the shop

392
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,393
to do some inventory
work afterwards.

393
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,731
You don't live in
community quarters.

394
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:11,567
No, we were lucky enough to
be assigned a private room.

395
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,319
I guess because
we ran the shop.

396
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,821
But at least we had
a little privacy.

397
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,781
Uh-huh.

398
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,407
There... that's her.

399
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,500
KIRA:
Odo!

400
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,752
We haven't picked up anyone
at the airlocks.

401
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,171
I can't hold up outbound
traffic any longer.

402
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:36,300
I'm sure he disposed
of the weapon before he left.

403
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,551
I heard about the list.

404
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,345
The one that Quark
got out of the wall.

405
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:43,349
Rom said it had been hidden
there during the occupation.

406
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,725
I couldn't help wondering

407
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,102
if it had something
to do with Vaatrik.

408
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,480
I've been wondering
the same thing.

409
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:08,541
ODO:
<i>Security Log, Stardate 47284.1.</i>

410
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:12,128
<i>In this job, there is</i>
<i>no unfinished business.</i>

411
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:17,175
<i>This assault on Quark reopens</i>
<i>a five-year-old murder case</i>

412
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:21,179
<i>that I've never--</i>
<i>not for a moment-- closed.</i>

413
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:26,433
<i>Patience is a lost virtue</i>
<i>to most; to me, an ally.</i>

414
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,728
I barely saw it!
I'm sorry.

415
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,479
I don't remember
any of the names.

416
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,607
All right, all right, let's...

417
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,776
just relax for a moment.

418
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,444
I really ought to be
getting back to my bar.

419
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,781
He's not dead yet, Rom.

420
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,867
They're not keeping him alive
by artificial means, are they?

421
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,284
My brother wouldn't want that.

422
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:48,206
No, he's clinging to life
all on his own.

423
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:49,957
Typical.

424
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:53,044
All right, let's try again.

425
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:55,337
Close your eyes.

426
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,965
Take a deep breath.

427
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:01,802
Clear your mind of
everything in it...

428
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,764
(<i> sotto voce</i> ):
if there's anything there.

429
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,473
Breathe.

430
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,560
Breathe.

431
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:15,149
Now... what do you see?

432
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:16,316
The bar.

433
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,401
Yes?

434
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,153
With my name on it.

435
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:23,699
The past, Rom,
not the future.

436
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,077
The box opens.

437
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:28,246
There's a piece
of paper inside it.

438
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:29,538
Yes! Yes, I see it.

439
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,664
Quark unfolds it.

440
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:31,874
Uh-huh.

441
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:34,210
There's a list of names,
Bajoran names.

442
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,461
Right.

443
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:38,380
The one at the very top
catches your eye.

444
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,675
And the first letter is...

445
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,719
"C!" It's a "C!"

446
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,429
And the next
letter is...

447
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,098
Oh... I...

448
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:49,225
Skip to the last letter
in the name, Rom.

449
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:50,517
"O!" It's an "O!"

450
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,394
Starts with a "C,"
ends with an "O."

451
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:55,522
And... and there's
a mark in the name.

452
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:56,899
An apostrophe.

453
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:57,900
Ches'so!

454
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,943
You're sure?

455
00:21:58,943 --> 00:21:59,944
Yes!

456
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:01,195
Maybe.

457
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,947
Maybe?

458
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:06,033
It's something
like Ches'so...

459
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,660
I think.

460
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,287
Oh...

461
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:11,538
(<i> laughing</i> )

462
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,878
Call me day or night
if you remember something else.

463
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,421
Uh-huh.

464
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:22,549
Anything?

465
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,095
Ches'so.

466
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:28,555
Might be the first name
on the list.

467
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:32,685
Remember anyone from those days
on the station with that name?

468
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:36,272
No, but I wasn't
here very long.

469
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:39,275
Hmm, so I recall.

470
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:41,319
We never talked
about it.

471
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:43,445
We never had to.

472
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,072
I would have
been executed.

473
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:48,075
You were innocent of the crime
I was investigating.

474
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,452
That wouldn't have mattered
to the Cardassians.

475
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,830
It mattered to me.

476
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:00,587
Remember your passes.

477
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:03,341
You there, keep moving.

478
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:11,515
This way, this way.

479
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:15,311
P.A.:
Radiation workers
report to observation level.

480
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:17,313
Hi, Dad.

481
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:18,856
Hey, how are you?

482
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:29,449
Do you mind
if I join you?

483
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,828
P.A.:
Sector Four salvage team,

484
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,248
report at once
to your work stations.

485
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:37,541
A pretty girl like you
shouldn't be eating alone.

486
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:40,086
I don't do whatever
it is you want--

487
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:42,046
not for money,
not for food.

488
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:43,589
No, you misunderstand...

489
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:44,840
I'm sorry.

490
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,385
Of course, I can
see how you could.

491
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:49,178
Let me start over.

492
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:51,138
You some kind
of security officer?

493
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,806
How did you know that?

494
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,308
You are,
aren't you?

495
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:56,810
Unofficially

496
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,520
I suppose
that's true.

497
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,189
Unofficially-- what's
that supposed to mean?

498
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:03,901
Gul Dukat asked me to
investigate the murder

499
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,778
of a Bajoran man
named Vaatrik.

500
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:08,239
I understand
you knew him.

501
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:09,907
Who says I did?

502
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:10,991
His widow.

503
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:23,963
I suppose she also
told you I killed him.

504
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,172
Did you?

505
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:27,300
No.

506
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:32,346
On the contrary, you
were in love with him.

507
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:34,181
No.

508
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,474
But... he was
in love with<i> you.</i>

509
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:37,726
No.

510
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,062
Doesn't sound like
much of a romance.

511
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:42,398
We weren't having a romance.

512
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,317
Then why would he tell his wife
that you were?

513
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:46,152
You'll have to ask him.

514
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:49,529
If you<i> were</i> having an affair,

515
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,865
I promise you,
I'll find out about it.

516
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,284
All you're going to find

517
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:54,910
is that I've been here
for two weeks.

518
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,330
I met the man
right after I arrived.

519
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,497
He had Pyrellian ginger tea.

520
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:01,875
How he managed to get it,
I don't know,

521
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,961
but I happen to<i> like</i> ginger tea.

522
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:05,921
We became friends.

523
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,756
Maybe he was attracted to me.

524
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,383
It never
went anywhere.

525
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:12,803
Why do you think
Dukat wanted you

526
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:14,430
on this investigation?

527
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,641
I'm sure he had good reasons.

528
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,352
Why not his own security people?

529
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:21,979
No Bajoran would talk to them.

530
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:24,357
That never stopped
the Cardassians before.

531
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:26,733
They have ways of getting
their information.

532
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:33,531
Something to think about.

533
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,660
Where were you last night?

534
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:42,166
I was at the bar.

535
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,376
I heard the Ferengi are allowed

536
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:45,669
to hire some Bajorans
for dog work.

537
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,380
It's better than the mines.

538
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,382
You haven't spent any time
in the mines.

539
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:50,466
How do
you know?

540
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:51,549
Your hands.

541
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:57,264
You're not bad at this.

542
00:25:57,264 --> 00:26:01,727
You're right, my last job was
at a replicator plant on Bajor.

543
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:03,354
You're not allowed
to quit those jobs.

544
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:04,397
What happened?

545
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:06,690
I hit a supervisor...

546
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,901
for trying...

547
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,487
what I thought you were trying
a few minutes ago.

548
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:17,201
Oh, well, I appreciate
your restraint this time.

549
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:19,953
You're not planning on leaving
the station soon?

550
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,456
If I were, would you have
the Cardassians stop me?

551
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:24,375
Yes.

552
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:28,045
Then I'm not planning
on leaving the station soon.

553
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,758
Let me tell
you something.

554
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:36,594
"Unofficially" or not, you're
working for the Cardassians.

555
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:38,222
Sooner or later, you're going

556
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:40,433
to have to choose
whose side you're on.

557
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:43,018
I don't choose sides.

558
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:46,813
Everyone has to choose sides,
Constable.

559
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:58,075
I don't know
what you're talking about.

560
00:26:58,075 --> 00:26:59,743
You knew nothing
about a list?

561
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:00,702
Nothing.

562
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:01,787
(<i> scoffs</i> )

563
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:08,710
Why would your husband have
hidden a list of Bajoran names?

564
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,212
I can't imagine why.

565
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:11,338
Are you sure it was his?

566
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:12,548
No.

567
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:14,425
Maybe the Cardassians
put it there

568
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:15,968
before
they left.

569
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:21,098
Someone on Bajor told
Quark where to find it.

570
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:22,433
I wish I could help.

571
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:24,642
I sort of liked
that little Ferengi.

572
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:26,312
Well, don't write
his eulogy yet.

573
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:27,854
He's still with us.

574
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:28,981
I thought you said...

575
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:30,023
He was shot

576
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,233
at point-blank range.

577
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,402
The Federation doctor
saved his life.

578
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:34,945
Good for him.

579
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:39,283
Does the name "Ches'so"
mean anything to you?

580
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:41,368
I don't think so.

581
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,660
Who is it?

582
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,747
Oh, just someone
I'd like to talk to.

583
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,665
Thank you for seeing me.

584
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:51,253
If this has anything to do
with my husband's murder,

585
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:52,879
I want to be of help

586
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,173
in any way I can.

587
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:57,301
Oh, there was one other thing.

588
00:27:57,301 --> 00:28:00,220
I understand your power
was recently terminated

589
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,679
for lack of payment.

590
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,016
That's right.

591
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:06,560
Yet, you were able
to transfer funds

592
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,646
to the power company
this morning.

593
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:12,650
I don't appreciate you looking
into my private affairs.

594
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:15,693
Just part
of a routine investigation.

595
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:18,864
If you could tell me
where you got the money.

596
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:21,908
A loan from a friend.

597
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,994
Of course.

598
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:25,703
And your friend's name?

599
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:29,791
Odo, this really has nothing
to do with your investigation.

600
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:34,004
Good, then you won't
mind giving me the name.

601
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:36,256
I'm sorry,
my friend is married.

602
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:38,008
I won't drag
him into this.

603
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:58,028
ODO:
<i>Security Log, supplemental.</i>

604
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:00,906
<i>The Ferengi holds on to life</i>

605
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:02,782
<i>like it's gold-pressed latinum.</i>

606
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:05,703
<i>Maybe he just doesn't want</i>
<i>his brother to get the bar.</i>

607
00:29:05,703 --> 00:29:09,873
<i>Or maybe he knows he's</i>
<i>the only real witness I have.</i>

608
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,791
BASHIR:
The next several hours
will tell the whole story.

609
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:15,379
We've done everything
we can for him.

610
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:16,963
I'll keep you updated.

611
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:25,431
I've got some good news
and some bad news.

612
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:27,474
I think I found
our Ches'so.

613
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:28,517
Who is he?

614
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:29,685
A Bajoran mining
engineer.

615
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:30,894
He's been very active

616
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,730
in charity work
for the war orphans.

617
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,523
What makes you think
he's our man?

618
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:37,109
Some connections from my
past suggested he might be.

619
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,152
His work brought him
to the station a lot.

620
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,571
The bad news is, he's dead.

621
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:41,739
Drowned in a pond

622
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:43,574
on his property
last night.

623
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:45,158
(<i> sighs deeply</i> )

624
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,326
I'm responsible.

625
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,911
How?

626
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:51,415
I mentioned the name "Ches'so"
to the Vaatrik woman.

627
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:53,959
If she recognized it
as "Ches'sarro"

628
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,712
and thought that he might
lead us to her...

629
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:58,672
Security to the Infirmary.

630
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:00,132
Acknowledged.

631
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:02,008
Major, I need some help.

632
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,427
Advise the medical
examiner

633
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:05,178
that I want a complete
autopsy on Ches'sarro.

634
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,388
And that his death

635
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:09,182
is to be treated
as a suspected homicide.

636
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,559
I'll need
the communication records

637
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,894
for the Vaatrik home
for the past 52 hours.

638
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,647
And have the central bank

639
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:16,690
keep a supervisor
on duty all night.

640
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,525
I'll need several
bank records, as well.

641
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:19,818
Whose?

642
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,278
I don't know yet.

643
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:27,993
I want round-the-clock
armed security on Quark.

644
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:29,202
No visitors.

645
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,496
Yes, sir.

646
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:33,039
(<i> laughing uproariously</i> )

647
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,416
Stop by one of
the holosuites.

648
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:37,085
Two programs
for the price of one.

649
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,098
I'm looking
for the proprietor

650
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,225
of this establishment.

651
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,979
Does he owe you money?

652
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,272
No.

653
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,649
Are you here
to arrest him?

654
00:30:58,649 --> 00:30:59,858
No.

655
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,194
Then you've found him.

656
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:04,404
Quark, at your service.

657
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,990
First drink
on the house.

658
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,325
An old, dreadful
Cardassian tradition.

659
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:09,451
What'll you have?

660
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:10,536
I don't drink.

661
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,122
A soft drink, then.

662
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,957
I don't drink.

663
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:19,211
I guess that's why we don't
see you around here much.

664
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:22,005
I'd like to ask you
a few questions

665
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,174
about the death
of the Bajoran chemist.

666
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:25,384
Wait a minute.

667
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:27,803
You're the shape-shifter.

668
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:31,181
You're the one who's
working for Dukat.

669
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:34,601
I'm not working for Dukat.

670
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:37,521
I'm just trying
to solve a murder.

671
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:40,607
No, I've heard about you.

672
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:44,778
You do some
Cardassian neck trick.

673
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:46,572
Am I right?

674
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:47,906
Not anymore.

675
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,825
That could go over big
in this room.

676
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:54,538
I'm checking on the alibi
of a young Bajoran woman,

677
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:57,082
red hair, named Kira Nerys.

678
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:58,500
She says she was here
last night.

679
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,419
Yeah, I remember her.
She wanted a job.

680
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:01,503
How long was she here?

681
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:03,756
Long enough.

682
00:32:03,756 --> 00:32:05,841
Long enough for what?

683
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:07,593
Oh, you know.

684
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:09,553
No, I don't.

685
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:11,054
Why don't you tell me?

686
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:17,143
She was showing me
her... initiative.

687
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:20,980
Is that some sort
of sexual reference?

688
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,025
These jobs are hard to come by.

689
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:29,740
Her credentials
were, um, very impressive.

690
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:31,867
Hey, listen!

691
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,660
Listen here,
what's the problem?

692
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,161
The problem is,
you're lying.

693
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:36,329
You got me all wrong.

694
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,706
I want the truth.

695
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:39,625
Otherwise, I'll just
turn you over to Dukat,

696
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:40,793
and he can get it
for me.

697
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:42,419
Okay, fine,
I didn't realize

698
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:44,379
we were dealing
with a murder here.

699
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,840
She didn't pay me enough
for that anyway.

700
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,847
She paid you for an alibi?

701
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:55,181
I wonder how Gul Dukat

702
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:57,893
will react when I tell
him about that?

703
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:01,020
I'm sure it'll cost me
a case of Cardassian ale.

704
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,816
Two cases at the very least.

705
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:04,942
A broken alibi?

706
00:33:04,942 --> 00:33:06,777
That sounds like progress.

707
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:09,613
Is there someone
you want me to arrest?

708
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:10,614
Not yet.

709
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:11,865
But soon.

710
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:13,826
I need a name, Odo.

711
00:33:13,826 --> 00:33:15,201
You'll get your name

712
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:18,705
when I'm certain
it's the right name.

713
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:23,251
Listen to the way
he speaks to me, Quark.

714
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:26,546
You're not afraid of anyone,
are you, shape-shifter?

715
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,632
Not even me.

716
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:31,217
I was right about you.

717
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:33,929
You are the man
for this job.

718
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:36,932
Listen, I feel you and I...

719
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:39,184
we've gotten off
to a bad start here.

720
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,060
Let me make it
up to you.

721
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,229
You need
anything?

722
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,690
A little ginger tea?

723
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,399
No, you don't drink.

724
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,862
Um... chocolate?

725
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:53,406
Maybe, uh, companionship?

726
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:56,075
(<i> Dukat chuckling</i> )

727
00:34:00,998 --> 00:34:03,959
(<i> laughing uproariously</i> )

728
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:12,009
You look like you just lost
your best friend, Constable.

729
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:13,677
Is Quark, uh...

730
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:15,637
Quark is stable.

731
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:16,680
What's this?

732
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,723
The list.

733
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:19,307
You found it?

734
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,809
No, I assembled it

735
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:22,435
from the Vaatrik woman's
communication records.

736
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:24,897
She's been talking to each
of these people a lot.

737
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:26,314
Odd thing is, she had never

738
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,817
talked to any of them
until two days ago.

739
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:30,318
When the list was stolen.

740
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,029
Interestingly,
every one of them

741
00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:35,114
has transferred exactly
100,000 Bajoran<i> litas</i>

742
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:38,159
into her bank account
within the last 26 hours.

743
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,160
Blackmail?

744
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,161
Blackmail.

745
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,080
What did they have to hide?

746
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,374
For one thing, that they'd
come out of the occupation

747
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:46,334
with that kind of money.

748
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,211
You think they were working
with the Cardassians.

749
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:51,798
Selling out their own world
for a profit.

750
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,050
Collaborators.

751
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:55,677
Not even a Ferengi
would do that.

752
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:56,929
It explains

753
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:58,096
a lot of things.

754
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,598
Do you have
enough to charge her?

755
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,058
Not yet,

756
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:02,809
but I'd like to bring her
in for questioning.

757
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,436
With your permission,

758
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:07,355
I'll ask the Bajoran authorities
to transport her here.

759
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:30,503
ODO:
<i>Nobody ever had to teach me</i>
<i>the "justice trick."</i>

760
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:33,048
<i>That's something</i>
<i>I've always known.</i>

761
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:36,468
<i>A racial memory</i>
<i>from my species, I guess.</i>

762
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:38,177
<i>It's really</i>
<i>the only clue I have</i>

763
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:41,264
<i>to what kind of people</i>
<i>they are.</i>

764
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,724
<i>Are these kinds of thoughts</i>

765
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:45,143
<i>appropriate</i>
<i>for a Starfleet log?</i>

766
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,062
<i>I don't care.</i>

767
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,941
<i>There's no room in justice</i>

768
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:55,361
<i>for loyalty</i>
<i>or friendship or love.</i>

769
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:59,449
<i>Justice, as the humans</i>
<i>like to say, is blind.</i>

770
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:01,284
<i>I used to believe that.</i>

771
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,912
<i>I'm not sure I can anymore.</i>

772
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:08,583
Yes, I lied about my alibi.

773
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,502
That doesn't make me a killer.

774
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,963
Where were you
when he was murdered?

775
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:16,008
Asleep, alone.

776
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:19,011
No one saw you
in the community quarters?

777
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:20,137
I wasn't there.

778
00:36:20,137 --> 00:36:21,888
I found a small corner and...

779
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,640
You're lying.

780
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,641
I...

781
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:25,725
Don't bother.

782
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,894
Your whole face changes.

783
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,105
I should have seen it before.

784
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:31,648
You don't lie well.

785
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:35,193
Thanks.

786
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,904
So why don't you
start telling the truth?

787
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:42,742
Whose side are you going
to be on, Constable?

788
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,494
I'm not going to play your game.

789
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:45,578
When I tell you
the truth,

790
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:47,039
you'll have
to choose.

791
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:49,499
No, no, that's why
I was given this job.

792
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:50,750
That's why all of you

793
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,251
always come to me
with problems.

794
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:53,712
I'm the outsider.

795
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,172
I'm on no one's side.

796
00:36:55,172 --> 00:36:57,049
All I'm interested
in is justice.

797
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:58,717
If you're innocent,
you'll go free.

798
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:01,803
If not, I'll turn you over
to Cardassian authorities.

799
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:04,139
That's the only
choice here.

800
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,396
I didn't kill him.

801
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:19,071
When he was killed,
I was on Level 21.

802
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:22,115
21? Ore processing?

803
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:24,367
Check the Cardassian
security logs.

804
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,953
You'll see a breach
on 21 last night.

805
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:33,919
I'm in the Bajoran
underground.

806
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:35,879
I came here to commit
acts of sabotage

807
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:36,963
against the Cardassians.

808
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,381
Last night, I succeeded.

809
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,633
(<i> sighs</i> )

810
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:44,930
The ore processor was damaged
by a sub-nucleonic device

811
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,472
at 2500 hours last night.

812
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:47,640
It'll be out of operation

813
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,060
for two weeks.

814
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,520
Give the mine workers
a little time off at least.

815
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:55,899
I'll describe the device I used

816
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:57,943
if you still
don't believe me.

817
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:02,321
That's why you needed
an alibi from Quark.

818
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,950
If you tell the Cardassians
the truth,

819
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,743
none of this will matter.

820
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:08,703
I'll be executed
for the sabotage.

821
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,747
Who cares about Bajorans
killing Bajorans

822
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:12,665
when you can hang a rebel?

823
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:18,797
Is this her?

824
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,632
I told you
when I have the name...

825
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,383
Is this her?

826
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:29,057
No.

827
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:31,059
You can go.

828
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:39,734
If you're lying,

829
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:40,944
shape-shifter...

830
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:42,112
If you know
as much about me

831
00:38:42,112 --> 00:38:43,696
as you say
you do, Gul Dukat,

832
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:46,491
you know
I don't lie.

833
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:47,659
I am convinced

834
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:50,036
that she did not kill Vaatrik.

835
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:11,183
(<i> door opens</i> )

836
00:39:11,183 --> 00:39:12,350
Is it too late
for visitors?

837
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,434
I'm sorry, sir.

838
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,103
No visitors
are permitted here.

839
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:17,105
Then perhaps you could just
put these in water for him?

840
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:19,107
Of course...

841
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,072
(<i> equipment powering down</i> )

842
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,668
(<i> gasps</i> )

843
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:45,842
(<i> Rom screaming</i> )

844
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:51,806
Odo to Bashir.

845
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,266
Report to the Infirmary
immediately.

846
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:54,726
BASHIR:
On my way.

847
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:55,894
(<i> Rom screaming</i> )
It's over, Rom.

848
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:56,978
Over!

849
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:58,063
You're a hero.

850
00:39:58,063 --> 00:39:59,397
I am?

851
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,566
You saved your brother's life.

852
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:13,786
(<i> screaming</i> )

853
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:32,347
I've never seen him before
in my life.

854
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:33,514
ODO:
Really?

855
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,267
Your communication
records indicate

856
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:37,018
that you made several
calls to his home

857
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:39,229
and received several
as well.

858
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:41,314
You also transferred
a large sum of money

859
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:45,026
into his account
two days ago.

860
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:47,112
I want to confer
with my advocate.

861
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:48,654
Certainly.

862
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:50,531
I'll make arrangements
for you to speak with him.

863
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:51,950
Meantime, the two of you

864
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:55,203
can introduce yourselves
to one another.

865
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:06,423
I don't care what you think
you know, shape-shifter.

866
00:41:06,423 --> 00:41:10,135
You will never be able to prove
that I killed my husband,

867
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:11,677
because I didn't.

868
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,222
I know.

869
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:36,119
When did
you realize?

870
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:37,996
The possibility
occurred to me

871
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:41,916
when you got the name
Ches'sarro so quickly.

872
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,960
Your friends
from the underground

873
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,837
must have already
suspected him

874
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:48,214
of being a collaborator.

875
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:52,427
Once I knew the eight names
were a list of collaborators,

876
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:57,056
the murder of Vaatrik made
sense for the first time.

877
00:41:57,056 --> 00:42:00,518
He must have been
a collaborator, too.

878
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,229
He had the money for ginger tea.

879
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:06,441
He had the private quarters.

880
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:10,611
I never had a motive
for his murder until now.

881
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:13,365
He kept his wife
in relative luxury.

882
00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:14,407
She surely

883
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:16,159
wouldn't have killed him.

884
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:20,163
So who would kill
a Cardassian collaborator?

885
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:26,085
Someone in the Bajoran
underground, of course.

886
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:31,966
A colleague of mine
was given the job

887
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,593
of sabotaging the ore processor.

888
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:36,762
Vaatrik was my responsibility.

889
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,556
You were here to execute him.

890
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:39,557
No.

891
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,851
I was here to find the list.

892
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:44,729
The names of the Bajorans
who were selling us out.

893
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:48,191
We'd been informed that Vaatrik
was their direct link to Dukat.

894
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,193
Ah...

895
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:54,364
That must have been why Dukat
chose me to investigate.

896
00:42:54,364 --> 00:42:57,909
He had to stay as far away
from this incident as he could

897
00:42:57,909 --> 00:43:01,787
so as not to endanger his
network of Bajoran sympathizers.

898
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:05,166
Obviously, I never found
the list.

899
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:07,293
But that's what I was
looking for in his shop

900
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:10,880
when Vaatrik walked in on me.

901
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,298
I didn't have a choice.

902
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:16,386
I misjudged you, Major.

903
00:43:16,386 --> 00:43:19,722
You were a better liar
than I gave you credit for.

904
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,267
You were working
for the Cardassians.

905
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:24,936
I haven't been
for more than a year.

906
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:28,147
You've had all that time
to tell me the truth.

907
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:32,360
I tried to tell you
the truth a hundred times.

908
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,950
What you think of me...

909
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,701
matters a lot.

910
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:47,875
I was afraid...

911
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:52,088
That it might affect
our friendship?

912
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,725
Maybe it doesn't have to.

913
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:14,068
Will you ever be able
to trust me the same way again?
