1
00:00:06,706 --> 00:00:08,642
I didn't kill him, you know.

2
00:00:10,882 --> 00:00:13,080
A lot of people
believed it was me.

3
00:00:13,121 --> 00:00:15,091
That shape-shifter thought so.

4
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:16,617
But he was wrong.

5
00:00:16,662 --> 00:00:19,635
It was a long time ago.

6
00:00:21,171 --> 00:00:24,041
Say what you will
about the Cardassians

7
00:00:24,078 --> 00:00:26,879
at least they could keep
the power on.

8
00:00:26,917 --> 00:00:28,511
Would you like more ice?

9
00:00:28,554 --> 00:00:29,579
I'm fine.

10
00:00:29,624 --> 00:00:31,218
You were always very kind.

11
00:00:31,328 --> 00:00:32,387
Was I?

12
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,332
You made life a little easier.

13
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,736
I ran a black market
for anyone who could pay.

14
00:00:36,772 --> 00:00:38,868
Never exactly thought
of myself as "kind."

15
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:41,007
There was always
that little extra ginger tea

16
00:00:41,048 --> 00:00:43,041
in that package you gave me,
wasn't there?

17
00:00:43,087 --> 00:00:46,288
You didn't call me to Bajor
to talk about tea.

18
00:00:47,663 --> 00:00:49,599
No.

19
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:51,934
I need a favor.

20
00:00:51,972 --> 00:00:53,031
For old times' sake?

21
00:00:53,075 --> 00:00:54,065
That's right.

22
00:00:54,111 --> 00:00:55,272
I'm still as kind as ever.

23
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,279
I can pay you.

24
00:00:56,383 --> 00:00:57,544
I'm listening.

25
00:00:57,585 --> 00:01:00,250
My husband kept a strongbox
in our shop on the station

26
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:01,258
buried in the wall.

27
00:01:01,292 --> 00:01:02,761
I want you to bring it to me.

28
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:04,595
What's in it?

29
00:01:04,633 --> 00:01:06,364
Nothing anyone would value.

30
00:01:06,405 --> 00:01:07,704
Anyone but you.

31
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,232
Sentimental reasons.

32
00:01:09,344 --> 00:01:12,248
Why not take a sentimental
journey back to the station?

33
00:01:12,284 --> 00:01:13,445
If it's your property.

34
00:01:13,486 --> 00:01:15,616
I couldn't stand
being back in that shop

35
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:17,594
where my husband was murdered.

36
00:01:17,629 --> 00:01:21,866
Or maybe you'd rather not
let Odo see you there.

37
00:01:22,873 --> 00:01:25,869
I'm sure he's forgotten
all about that by now.

38
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,913
Can you neutralize
the security system?

39
00:01:31,827 --> 00:01:35,962
It's behind the paneled wall
on the left as you enter.

40
00:01:36,002 --> 00:01:38,166
Four panels in, five up.

41
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:40,805
Four in...

42
00:01:40,847 --> 00:01:42,714
five up.

43
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,121
And I can pay you
five bars of latinum.

44
00:01:46,158 --> 00:01:47,991
Five?

45
00:01:48,028 --> 00:01:49,964
And, as always, my...

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,130
personal gratitude.

47
00:01:59,387 --> 00:02:01,756
A day...

48
00:02:01,792 --> 00:02:03,523
maybe two.

49
00:04:27,587 --> 00:04:34,398
Commence Station Security Log,
Stardate 47282.5.

50
00:04:34,435 --> 00:04:36,906
At the request
of Commander Sisko

51
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,036
I will hereafter
be recording a daily log

52
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:41,447
of law enforcement affairs.

53
00:04:41,483 --> 00:04:45,584
The reason for this exercise
is beyond my comprehension

54
00:04:45,626 --> 00:04:48,656
except perhaps that humans
have a compulsion

55
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,764
to keep records
and lists and files...

56
00:04:51,807 --> 00:04:54,608
so many, in fact, that
they have to invent new ways

57
00:04:54,646 --> 00:04:57,243
to store them microscopically.

58
00:04:57,285 --> 00:05:01,192
Otherwise, their records would
overrun all known civilization.

59
00:05:01,227 --> 00:05:06,296
My own very adequate memory not
being good enough for Starfleet

60
00:05:06,338 --> 00:05:08,137
I am pleased to put my voice

61
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:10,476
to this official record
of this day.

62
00:05:10,514 --> 00:05:12,678
Everything's under control.

63
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:14,621
End log.

64
00:05:20,436 --> 00:05:22,201
Now, when we get
to the entrance

65
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,971
you stay flat against the wall.

66
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:24,978
Uh-huh.

67
00:05:25,013 --> 00:05:26,208
It's a pulsatel lockseal.

68
00:05:26,249 --> 00:05:28,048
I can get it to release
in 25 seconds.

69
00:05:28,086 --> 00:05:30,182
25 seconds?
But somebody will see us.

70
00:05:30,224 --> 00:05:31,192
Let me do it.

71
00:05:31,226 --> 00:05:34,597
You?
We'd be at it all night.

72
00:05:36,872 --> 00:05:38,899
All night?

73
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:42,110
No, only about ten seconds.

74
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,483
How would you get
a pulsatel lockseal

75
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,422
to release in ten seconds?

76
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:48,123
You have one
on the storeroom door.

77
00:05:48,163 --> 00:05:49,462
So?

78
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,835
Sometimes, when you forget
to leave me the desealer

79
00:05:51,872 --> 00:05:53,307
I have to get
the storeroom open.

80
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:56,040
You've unsealed the storeroom
without my knowledge?

81
00:05:56,081 --> 00:05:57,641
Only to serve
a customer's needs.

82
00:05:57,685 --> 00:05:58,653
In ten seconds?

83
00:05:58,687 --> 00:06:00,384
You forget fairly often.

84
00:06:00,424 --> 00:06:01,757
Ten seconds...

85
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:06,192
We'll see how you handle
the desealing rod.

86
00:06:06,237 --> 00:06:07,797
That's all right,
I have my own.

87
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,933
What?

88
00:06:08,976 --> 00:06:10,275
Nog made it for me.

89
00:06:10,346 --> 00:06:12,282
Boy's always been
clever with his hands.

90
00:06:12,383 --> 00:06:13,647
My storeroom...

91
00:06:13,686 --> 00:06:15,280
Time this, brother.

92
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,292
You'll be very proud.

93
00:06:21,738 --> 00:06:24,335
There, you see?

94
00:06:26,347 --> 00:06:27,907
Thief! Don't deny it.

95
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:30,047
You've been stealing from me.

96
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:31,490
Brother, I never...

97
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:32,493
Tomorrow morning

98
00:06:32,527 --> 00:06:34,360
I'm changing
my entire lock system.

99
00:06:41,213 --> 00:06:43,274
Four in...

100
00:06:43,318 --> 00:06:45,551
five up.

101
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,187
Here, it's behind this one.

102
00:06:48,228 --> 00:06:52,169
Keep an eye on the Promenade,
while I burn off the panel.

103
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:53,365
The glare
could attract attention.

104
00:06:53,441 --> 00:06:54,374
I have a better idea.

105
00:06:54,443 --> 00:06:56,003
A better idea?

106
00:06:56,046 --> 00:06:57,640
I took the liberty
of bringing along

107
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:59,118
a small vial of magnasite drops.

108
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,120
Magnasite drops?

109
00:07:00,155 --> 00:07:01,454
What are magnasite drops?

110
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:03,758
A compound that will eat
through duranium.

111
00:07:03,796 --> 00:07:06,632
One on each corner
and the panel will fall off.

112
00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:07,864
How do you know that?

113
00:07:07,905 --> 00:07:10,935
When you were
in the Gamma Quadrant overnight

114
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:12,573
we did very good business.

115
00:07:12,616 --> 00:07:15,213
Naturally, I had to keep
your profits safe

116
00:07:15,255 --> 00:07:18,056
but you had the only key
to the latinum floor vault.

117
00:07:18,094 --> 00:07:19,825
You got
into my latinum floor vault?

118
00:07:19,865 --> 00:07:20,855
With that?

119
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:28,541
I didn't want to tell you

120
00:07:28,584 --> 00:07:31,112
because then you'd know
I burnt off your floor plates.

121
00:07:31,157 --> 00:07:33,628
But I replaced them
out of my own salary, brother.

122
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:35,393
My vault...

123
00:07:35,466 --> 00:07:37,402
Should I take it out for you?

124
00:07:37,503 --> 00:07:38,938
Don't touch it!

125
00:07:38,973 --> 00:07:43,244
Don't you touch anything
ever, ever again.

126
00:08:01,823 --> 00:08:03,953
Just a piece of paper?

127
00:08:03,995 --> 00:08:05,965
A treasure map, perhaps?

128
00:08:08,471 --> 00:08:10,168
What does it mean, brother?

129
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:12,646
I have no idea.

130
00:08:12,681 --> 00:08:16,121
Eight names,
all of them Bajoran.

131
00:08:16,156 --> 00:08:18,423
I want to get
a picture of this list

132
00:08:18,493 --> 00:08:20,019
before I reseal the box.

133
00:08:20,063 --> 00:08:21,430
Go, get me an imager.

134
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,799
Go!

135
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,978
You can't be in here...
we're closed.

136
00:08:46,322 --> 00:08:48,793
Well, if you really
want a drink...

137
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:55,000
She sent you, didn't she?

138
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,979
She knew you couldn't resist
opening it.

139
00:09:00,018 --> 00:09:01,647
I'm sorry.

140
00:09:03,092 --> 00:09:04,321
Yeah...

141
00:09:04,361 --> 00:09:05,921
me, too.

142
00:09:16,121 --> 00:09:17,282
Brother!

143
00:09:18,793 --> 00:09:20,092
Brother?

144
00:09:21,232 --> 00:09:23,259
Brother!

145
00:09:23,303 --> 00:09:24,396
Help!

146
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,341
Somebody, help!

147
00:09:26,376 --> 00:09:29,747
My brother's been killed!

148
00:09:34,393 --> 00:09:35,726
Ten cc's of cortolin.

149
00:09:35,763 --> 00:09:37,630
I want an antigrav lift
in here, stat!

150
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:39,136
Ready the cortical stimulator.

151
00:09:39,171 --> 00:09:40,161
What kind of weapon?

152
00:09:40,206 --> 00:09:41,539
I am waiting for an answer!

153
00:09:41,576 --> 00:09:43,478
Whatever it was had
to get by the scanners.

154
00:09:43,513 --> 00:09:45,540
My best guess is a compressed
tetryon beam weapon.

155
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,555
Okay, okay, that's consistent
with what I'm seeing.

156
00:09:47,656 --> 00:09:48,817
Get the stimulator over here.

157
00:09:48,859 --> 00:09:49,986
Doctor?

158
00:09:50,028 --> 00:09:52,522
Thoracic cavity rupture,
extensive neural trauma.

159
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:54,093
Now.

160
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,909
Rom says it was a robbery.

161
00:09:56,943 --> 00:09:58,036
Was anything taken?

162
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:00,312
He says he doesn't know,
but he knows.

163
00:10:00,351 --> 00:10:02,184
Security's stopping
everyone at the airlocks

164
00:10:02,222 --> 00:10:03,885
but it took them five minutes
to get into position.

165
00:10:03,925 --> 00:10:05,952
The assailant
may already be on a ship.

166
00:10:05,996 --> 00:10:07,590
Delay all outgoing vessels
as long as you can.

167
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,169
Advise their respective
security details.

168
00:10:09,203 --> 00:10:10,763
We've got to get him
to the surgery.

169
00:10:10,807 --> 00:10:12,572
Help me get him up here.

170
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:13,579
I got him.

171
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,912
Easy now.
Slide him in.

172
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:15,917
All right.

173
00:10:15,951 --> 00:10:16,941
Watch his head.

174
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:21,893
He's dying, isn't he?

175
00:10:21,931 --> 00:10:22,921
He's dying.

176
00:10:22,967 --> 00:10:25,131
What am I going to do
if my brother dies?

177
00:10:25,172 --> 00:10:29,477
Do? Oh, you'll have a lot to do
once this place is yours.

178
00:10:29,515 --> 00:10:30,779
But if he dies...

179
00:10:30,818 --> 00:10:32,117
Mine?

180
00:10:32,154 --> 00:10:34,352
"Wives serve, brothers inherit."

181
00:10:34,392 --> 00:10:37,923
Rule of Acquisition Number 139,
if I'm not mistaken.

182
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:39,402
I hadn't thought of that.

183
00:10:39,436 --> 00:10:40,461
Really?

184
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:44,071
I had, because it's
a solid motive for murder.

185
00:10:44,114 --> 00:10:45,640
Yes, actually.

186
00:10:45,684 --> 00:10:49,351
I have heard of a few
untimely deaths that seemed...

187
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,198
Wait a minute.

188
00:10:52,232 --> 00:10:54,328
You're not suggesting
that I...

189
00:10:54,369 --> 00:10:56,202
I've had my eye on you
for a long time, Rom.

190
00:10:56,241 --> 00:10:58,439
You're not as stupid
as you look.

191
00:10:58,478 --> 00:10:59,571
I am, too.

192
00:10:59,615 --> 00:11:00,742
I would never...

193
00:11:00,783 --> 00:11:02,012
Constable, it's his own brother.

194
00:11:02,053 --> 00:11:03,021
My own brother.

195
00:11:03,055 --> 00:11:04,023
I hardly...

196
00:11:04,057 --> 00:11:05,218
Stay out of this, Commander.

197
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,489
I know these Ferengi.

198
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:09,229
They'd sell their own flesh and
blood for a Cardassian groat.

199
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:10,829
Odo, he's a family friend.

200
00:11:10,872 --> 00:11:12,842
His son is very close
to my boy.

201
00:11:12,876 --> 00:11:14,778
Well, you'd better tell his son

202
00:11:14,814 --> 00:11:17,012
that dad's going
to the lunar prison

203
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:18,894
on Meldrar l...
200 degrees in the shade.

204
00:11:19,028 --> 00:11:20,657
I didn't!
It's not true!

205
00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:22,897
Oh...

206
00:11:22,937 --> 00:11:24,531
Irony of ironies.

207
00:11:24,574 --> 00:11:25,873
I finally get the bar

208
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,940
and I'm falsely accused
of my brother's murder.

209
00:11:28,984 --> 00:11:30,817
Rom...

210
00:11:30,854 --> 00:11:32,255
as a friend

211
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,423
if you know anything
that might be helpful

212
00:11:35,465 --> 00:11:37,435
I think you should tell us.

213
00:11:37,469 --> 00:11:38,768
It was a list.

214
00:11:38,805 --> 00:11:42,803
The man who shot my brother
stole a list.

215
00:11:42,847 --> 00:11:44,749
What kind of list?

216
00:11:44,785 --> 00:11:46,550
Of names...

217
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:48,354
eight Bajoran names.

218
00:11:48,393 --> 00:11:50,864
It was in this box
we... we found.

219
00:11:50,898 --> 00:11:52,765
Found?

220
00:11:52,802 --> 00:11:55,137
In a manner of speaking.

221
00:11:56,844 --> 00:11:59,942
My brother was hired by someone
on Bajor to retrieve it.

222
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:00,953
Who?

223
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:01,955
He didn't tell me.

224
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:03,322
He never told me anything.

225
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:05,352
I tried so hard
to earn Quark's trust.

226
00:12:05,396 --> 00:12:07,867
Now he's dead, and I can
never earn his trust.

227
00:12:07,902 --> 00:12:09,531
Just his share of the profits.

228
00:12:09,572 --> 00:12:11,303
I swear I don't know
who hired him.

229
00:12:11,343 --> 00:12:14,008
All I know is that the box
had been hidden years ago.

230
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:15,541
How many years ago?

231
00:12:15,586 --> 00:12:18,616
I'm not sure... when
the Cardassians were here.

232
00:12:18,659 --> 00:12:21,187
When the ship's store used
to be the chemist's shop.

233
00:12:22,768 --> 00:12:24,499
The chemist's shop?

234
00:12:24,538 --> 00:12:25,837
That's right.

235
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:30,550
Here? This is where
you found the box?

236
00:12:30,586 --> 00:12:32,419
Behind a duranium wall panel.

237
00:12:32,456 --> 00:12:34,255
I'll show you which one.

238
00:12:35,262 --> 00:12:37,095
Do you want me to open it?

239
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:39,160
I can do it in ten seconds.

240
00:12:53,035 --> 00:12:55,370
You asked to see me?

241
00:12:55,406 --> 00:12:57,604
Yes... yes, please come in.

242
00:12:59,382 --> 00:13:02,286
I'm Gul Dukat.
We've met before.

243
00:13:02,322 --> 00:13:03,517
Have we?

244
00:13:03,558 --> 00:13:05,084
I wouldn't expect you
to remember.

245
00:13:05,128 --> 00:13:07,861
I was one of the guests
at the reception

246
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,235
at the Bajoran Center
for Science.

247
00:13:10,272 --> 00:13:12,539
It must have been two years ago.

248
00:13:12,578 --> 00:13:14,811
Ah, yes...

249
00:13:14,849 --> 00:13:17,788
when the Cardassian
High Command was invited to...

250
00:13:17,822 --> 00:13:19,051
view me.

251
00:13:20,094 --> 00:13:21,961
You were very amusing
that night.

252
00:13:21,998 --> 00:13:23,934
Was I.

253
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,533
Yes... you did
a Cardassian neck trick.

254
00:13:26,575 --> 00:13:28,442
Brought the house down.

255
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:31,007
The Bajoran scientist
who worked with me

256
00:13:31,051 --> 00:13:33,545
thought you might
find it entertaining.

257
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:36,084
He made me practice
for weeks on the...

258
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:37,758
Cardassian neck trick.

259
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:40,829
Gul Hadar couldn't
stop talking about it.

260
00:13:40,873 --> 00:13:44,608
He wanted to send you out
to entertain the troops.

261
00:13:44,648 --> 00:13:47,415
I, on the other hand,
began to wonder

262
00:13:47,454 --> 00:13:49,185
if you couldn't provide

263
00:13:49,258 --> 00:13:52,823
a more valuable service
for the Cardassian Empire.

264
00:13:54,937 --> 00:13:57,636
I've stayed informed
about you, Odo

265
00:13:57,677 --> 00:14:01,378
ever since you walked out
on your Bajoran keepers.

266
00:14:01,418 --> 00:14:04,687
I simply felt I could learn
more outside a laboratory.

267
00:14:04,725 --> 00:14:07,162
Yes, you've become
quite the student

268
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,463
of humanoid nature,
haven't you?

269
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:13,542
Just what is it
you need, Gul Dukat?

270
00:14:13,578 --> 00:14:15,742
Have you ever seen
a dead man before?

271
00:14:15,783 --> 00:14:17,514
Yes.

272
00:14:17,554 --> 00:14:18,955
In your mines.

273
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,553
Oh, those are casualties.

274
00:14:23,834 --> 00:14:25,201
This...

275
00:14:29,346 --> 00:14:30,781
is murder.

276
00:14:30,816 --> 00:14:34,780
And I've decided
you're going to investigate it.

277
00:14:34,825 --> 00:14:36,761
Me?

278
00:14:36,796 --> 00:14:38,163
Why me?

279
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:39,566
I'm no investigator.

280
00:14:39,602 --> 00:14:43,007
Ah, but I suspect
you'd make a good one.

281
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:48,384
Shape-shifting your way into
places the rest of us can't go.

282
00:14:49,925 --> 00:14:53,092
I have no intention
of being a Cardassian agent.

283
00:14:55,003 --> 00:14:57,236
Not an agent.

284
00:14:57,274 --> 00:14:58,743
An investigator.

285
00:14:58,777 --> 00:15:00,212
There's a difference?

286
00:15:00,247 --> 00:15:03,652
We can't have
these Bajorans running around

287
00:15:03,688 --> 00:15:06,216
murdering each other,
now, can we?

288
00:15:06,294 --> 00:15:09,324
I'm talking about order here,
justice.

289
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:10,802
There's very little justice

290
00:15:10,838 --> 00:15:13,332
in the Cardassian
occupation of Bajor.

291
00:15:13,376 --> 00:15:15,745
Don't push me, Odo.

292
00:15:18,053 --> 00:15:22,256
My superiors would have me
"solve" this murder

293
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:27,705
by rounding up ten Bajorans
at random and executing them.

294
00:15:29,211 --> 00:15:33,050
I'm hoping you'll give me
a better alternative.

295
00:15:38,932 --> 00:15:41,267
Now, these Bajorans
won't talk to us

296
00:15:41,304 --> 00:15:43,137
but they seem to trust you.

297
00:15:43,174 --> 00:15:46,306
I understand you used to
sort out petty disputes

298
00:15:46,415 --> 00:15:49,786
concerning food, blankets,
everyday sorts of things.

299
00:15:49,822 --> 00:15:51,257
They come to you.

300
00:15:51,293 --> 00:15:54,163
I suppose I'm considered
a neutral observer.

301
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:57,195
Of course...
you're not one of them.

302
00:15:57,239 --> 00:16:00,337
And for that,
you should be thankful.

303
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:02,076
So...

304
00:16:02,116 --> 00:16:05,715
here's one more petty dispute.

305
00:16:05,758 --> 00:16:07,785
Only this time...

306
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:10,893
I'm bringing it to you.

307
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:12,906
Find the murderer.

308
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,757
Are there any witnesses?

309
00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:33,483
I'm sorry to keep you
waiting, Mrs. Vaatrik.

310
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,011
This is Odo.

311
00:16:35,056 --> 00:16:38,223
He'll be investigating
your husband's death.

312
00:16:38,262 --> 00:16:41,235
Perhaps you two
already know each other.

313
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:43,034
Have you been into the shop?

314
00:16:43,073 --> 00:16:45,909
No, I don't use chemicals.

315
00:16:45,946 --> 00:16:48,213
I've assigned this space to you.

316
00:16:48,251 --> 00:16:50,552
We'll get you anything you need.

317
00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:53,528
Madam, my sympathies.

318
00:16:54,532 --> 00:16:55,796
Good hunting.

319
00:17:03,852 --> 00:17:06,187
I'm sorry for your loss.

320
00:17:06,224 --> 00:17:07,591
Thank you.

321
00:17:11,202 --> 00:17:12,796
Do you...

322
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,709
have any idea
who might have done this?

323
00:17:15,745 --> 00:17:17,647
I have a very good idea.

324
00:17:17,683 --> 00:17:18,708
You do?

325
00:17:18,752 --> 00:17:20,722
May I be honest with you?

326
00:17:20,756 --> 00:17:23,319
That might be helpful.

327
00:17:24,498 --> 00:17:26,434
My husband was having an affair.

328
00:17:30,144 --> 00:17:33,915
Some girl showed up on the
station a couple of weeks ago.

329
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:36,855
He became infatuated with her,
I don't know.

330
00:17:36,892 --> 00:17:38,555
Why are men like that?

331
00:17:39,898 --> 00:17:42,131
Believe me, I have no idea.

332
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:45,109
We had two wonderful years
together...

333
00:17:45,143 --> 00:17:47,580
until she arrived.

334
00:17:47,615 --> 00:17:48,914
And now...

335
00:17:48,951 --> 00:17:50,443
You loved him very much.

336
00:17:50,521 --> 00:17:51,888
Of course I did.

337
00:17:51,925 --> 00:17:53,986
Then perhaps you could
explain something

338
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:55,019
I don't understand.

339
00:17:55,065 --> 00:17:57,001
What's that?

340
00:17:57,036 --> 00:17:59,029
Mr. Vaatrik was found dead
two hours ago.

341
00:17:59,073 --> 00:18:00,667
Mrs. Vaatrik hasn't shed a tear.

342
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,407
What makes you think...

343
00:18:02,447 --> 00:18:05,386
By necessity,
I'm an observer, Mrs. Vaatrik.

344
00:18:05,421 --> 00:18:06,754
When a humanoid cries

345
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:09,730
the epidermis below the eyes
swells noticeably.

346
00:18:09,763 --> 00:18:11,581
Your epidermis is
perfectly normal.

347
00:18:12,751 --> 00:18:15,245
I've been too angry to cry...
I, I... the shock...

348
00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:17,088
Of course.

349
00:18:18,095 --> 00:18:19,063
So...

350
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,623
you were about to accuse

351
00:18:20,668 --> 00:18:23,401
this other woman of the murder,
I believe.

352
00:18:23,441 --> 00:18:26,277
He confessed his indiscretion
to me days ago

353
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:28,044
but said it was over.

354
00:18:28,084 --> 00:18:29,313
And when he broke
it off with her

355
00:18:29,354 --> 00:18:30,583
she killed him
in a jealous rage.

356
00:18:30,623 --> 00:18:32,320
Something like that.

357
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,091
Do you know her name?

358
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,601
No, but I can point her
out to you.

359
00:18:36,636 --> 00:18:38,105
Move along.

360
00:18:38,139 --> 00:18:41,408
Step back from the gate.

361
00:18:41,447 --> 00:18:42,916
All of you.

362
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:46,014
That's enough.

363
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:51,290
Attention.
All bio-organic materials

364
00:18:51,335 --> 00:18:55,743
must be disposed of
according to regulations.

365
00:18:55,778 --> 00:18:58,443
When was the last time
you saw Mr. Vaatrik alive?

366
00:18:58,485 --> 00:18:59,977
At dinner.

367
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,455
He went back to the shop

368
00:19:01,491 --> 00:19:03,758
to do some inventory
work afterwards.

369
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:07,600
You don't live
in community quarters.

370
00:19:07,638 --> 00:19:10,941
No, we were lucky enough
to be assigned a private room.

371
00:19:10,979 --> 00:19:12,744
I guess because we ran the shop.

372
00:19:12,783 --> 00:19:14,309
But at least we had
a little privacy.

373
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:15,617
Uh-huh.

374
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,990
There... that's her.

375
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,868
Odo!

376
00:19:26,914 --> 00:19:29,442
We haven't picked up anyone
at the airlocks.

377
00:19:29,486 --> 00:19:32,014
I can't hold up outbound
traffic any longer.

378
00:19:32,058 --> 00:19:34,962
I'm sure he disposed
of the weapon before he left.

379
00:19:34,997 --> 00:19:36,330
I heard about the list.

380
00:19:36,367 --> 00:19:38,634
The one that Quark
got out of the wall.

381
00:19:38,673 --> 00:19:42,705
Rom said it had been hidden
there during the occupation.

382
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:43,738
I couldn't help wondering

383
00:19:43,784 --> 00:19:45,378
if it had something
to do with Vaatrik.

384
00:19:46,423 --> 00:19:49,088
I've been wondering
the same thing.

385
00:20:02,591 --> 00:20:07,398
Security Log, Stardate 47284.1.

386
00:20:07,435 --> 00:20:11,501
In this job, there is
no unfinished business.

387
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:16,578
This assault on Quark reopens
a five-year-old murder case

388
00:20:16,622 --> 00:20:20,357
that I've never...
not for a moment... closed.

389
00:20:20,398 --> 00:20:25,866
Patience is a lost virtue
to most; to me, an ally.

390
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:27,036
I barely saw it!

391
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,206
I'm sorry.

392
00:20:28,248 --> 00:20:30,446
I don't remember
any of the names.

393
00:20:30,486 --> 00:20:32,923
All right, all right, let's...

394
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:35,192
just relax for a moment.

395
00:20:35,229 --> 00:20:36,789
I really ought to be
getting back to my bar.

396
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,300
He's not dead yet, Rom.

397
00:20:40,342 --> 00:20:43,109
They're not keeping him alive
by artificial means, are they?

398
00:20:43,147 --> 00:20:44,673
My brother wouldn't want that.

399
00:20:44,718 --> 00:20:47,554
No, he's clinging to life
all on his own.

400
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,321
Typical.

401
00:20:49,428 --> 00:20:52,298
All right, let's try again.

402
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,669
Close your eyes.

403
00:20:54,706 --> 00:20:56,836
Take a deep breath.

404
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,451
Clear your mind
of everything in it...

405
00:21:01,488 --> 00:21:04,255
if there's anything there.

406
00:21:04,293 --> 00:21:05,785
Breathe.

407
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,867
Breathe.

408
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:14,315
Now... what do you see?

409
00:21:14,382 --> 00:21:15,681
The bar.

410
00:21:15,719 --> 00:21:16,778
Yes?

411
00:21:16,821 --> 00:21:18,313
With my name on it.

412
00:21:18,425 --> 00:21:22,992
The past, Rom, not the future.

413
00:21:23,035 --> 00:21:25,336
The box opens.

414
00:21:25,407 --> 00:21:27,674
There's a piece
of paper inside it.

415
00:21:27,711 --> 00:21:28,872
Yes! Yes, I see it.

416
00:21:28,915 --> 00:21:29,974
Quark unfolds it.

417
00:21:30,017 --> 00:21:31,007
Uh-huh.

418
00:21:31,052 --> 00:21:33,649
There's a list of names,
Bajoran names.

419
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:34,660
Right.

420
00:21:34,694 --> 00:21:37,564
The one at the very top
catches your eye.

421
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,040
And the first letter is...

422
00:21:41,074 --> 00:21:42,543
"C!" It's a "C!"

423
00:21:42,578 --> 00:21:44,811
And the next letter is...

424
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,376
Oh... I...

425
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,721
Skip to the last letter
in the name, Rom.

426
00:21:48,758 --> 00:21:49,726
"O!" It's an "O!"

427
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,730
Starts with a "C,"
ends with an "O."

428
00:21:51,764 --> 00:21:54,862
And... and there's
a mark in the name.

429
00:21:54,905 --> 00:21:56,238
An apostrophe.

430
00:21:56,275 --> 00:21:57,243
Ches'so!

431
00:21:57,277 --> 00:21:58,245
You're sure?

432
00:21:58,279 --> 00:21:59,247
Yes!

433
00:21:59,281 --> 00:22:00,648
Maybe.

434
00:22:00,684 --> 00:22:02,347
Maybe?

435
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:05,325
It's something like Ches'so...

436
00:22:05,362 --> 00:22:07,264
I think.

437
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:08,768
Oh...

438
00:22:14,447 --> 00:22:17,214
Call me day or night
if you remember something else.

439
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:18,848
Uh-huh.

440
00:22:20,895 --> 00:22:21,954
Anything?

441
00:22:24,303 --> 00:22:25,396
Ches'so.

442
00:22:25,472 --> 00:22:27,807
Might be the first name
on the list.

443
00:22:27,843 --> 00:22:31,944
Remember anyone from those days
on the station with that name?

444
00:22:31,986 --> 00:22:35,757
No, but I wasn't here very long.

445
00:22:35,795 --> 00:22:38,665
Hmm, so I recall.

446
00:22:38,701 --> 00:22:40,797
We never talked about it.

447
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:43,003
We never had to.

448
00:22:43,044 --> 00:22:44,570
I would have been executed.

449
00:22:44,615 --> 00:22:47,747
You were innocent of the crime
I was investigating.

450
00:22:47,787 --> 00:22:49,951
That wouldn't have mattered
to the Cardassians.

451
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:52,430
It mattered to me.

452
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:00,041
Remember your passes.

453
00:23:00,081 --> 00:23:02,848
You there, keep moving.

454
00:23:06,796 --> 00:23:09,632
This way, this way.

455
00:23:10,938 --> 00:23:14,777
Radiation workers
report to observation level.

456
00:23:14,814 --> 00:23:16,613
Hi, Dad.

457
00:23:16,651 --> 00:23:18,211
Hey, how are you?

458
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,904
Do you mind if I join you?

459
00:23:30,114 --> 00:23:32,107
Sector Four salvage team

460
00:23:32,152 --> 00:23:34,680
report at once
to your work stations.

461
00:23:34,725 --> 00:23:37,162
A pretty girl like you
shouldn't be eating alone.

462
00:23:37,197 --> 00:23:39,691
I don't do
whatever it is you want...

463
00:23:39,736 --> 00:23:41,501
not for money, not for food.

464
00:23:41,606 --> 00:23:43,337
No, you misunderstand...

465
00:23:43,377 --> 00:23:44,345
I'm sorry.

466
00:23:44,379 --> 00:23:46,976
Of course, I can see
how you could.

467
00:23:47,017 --> 00:23:48,509
Let me start over.

468
00:23:48,588 --> 00:23:50,752
You some kind
of security officer?

469
00:23:50,793 --> 00:23:52,285
How did you know that?

470
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,822
You are, aren't you?

471
00:23:55,336 --> 00:23:57,864
Unofficially,
I suppose that's true.

472
00:23:57,908 --> 00:23:59,878
Unofficially... what's
that supposed to mean?

473
00:23:59,913 --> 00:24:03,580
Gul Dukat asked me
to investigate the murder

474
00:24:03,621 --> 00:24:05,488
of a Bajoran man named Vaatrik.

475
00:24:05,592 --> 00:24:07,961
I understand you knew him.

476
00:24:07,998 --> 00:24:09,490
Who says I did?

477
00:24:09,567 --> 00:24:10,728
His widow.

478
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,520
I suppose she also
told you I killed him.

479
00:24:23,598 --> 00:24:24,759
Did you?

480
00:24:26,103 --> 00:24:27,264
No.

481
00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:31,942
On the contrary,
you were in love with him.

482
00:24:32,952 --> 00:24:33,942
No.

483
00:24:33,988 --> 00:24:36,186
But... he was
in love with you.

484
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:37,319
No.

485
00:24:37,362 --> 00:24:39,765
Doesn't sound
like much of a romance.

486
00:24:39,801 --> 00:24:42,102
We weren't having a romance.

487
00:24:42,138 --> 00:24:43,971
Then why would he tell his wife
that you were?

488
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,775
You'll have to ask him.

489
00:24:47,317 --> 00:24:49,150
If you were having an affair

490
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:51,557
I promise you,
I'll find out about it.

491
00:24:51,593 --> 00:24:52,994
All you're going to find

492
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:54,760
is that I've been here
for two weeks.

493
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,930
I met the man
right after I arrived.

494
00:24:56,971 --> 00:24:59,169
He had Pyrellian ginger tea.

495
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:01,545
How he managed to get it,
I don't know

496
00:25:01,582 --> 00:25:03,643
but I happen to like ginger tea.

497
00:25:03,686 --> 00:25:05,553
We became friends.

498
00:25:05,658 --> 00:25:07,216
Maybe he was attracted to me.

499
00:25:07,349 --> 00:25:08,818
It never went anywhere.

500
00:25:09,855 --> 00:25:12,190
Why do you think
Dukat wanted you

501
00:25:12,226 --> 00:25:13,855
on this investigation?

502
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:17,033
I'm sure he had good reasons.

503
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,801
Why not his own security people?

504
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,471
No Bajoran would talk to them.

505
00:25:21,514 --> 00:25:23,712
That never stopped
the Cardassians before.

506
00:25:23,751 --> 00:25:26,120
They have ways of getting
their information.

507
00:25:30,734 --> 00:25:32,967
Something to think about.

508
00:25:33,974 --> 00:25:36,275
Where were you last night?

509
00:25:39,753 --> 00:25:40,812
I was at the bar.

510
00:25:40,856 --> 00:25:42,883
I heard the Ferengi are allowed

511
00:25:42,927 --> 00:25:45,160
to hire some Bajorans
for dog work.

512
00:25:45,199 --> 00:25:46,964
It's better than the mines.

513
00:25:47,002 --> 00:25:48,904
You haven't spent any time
in the mines.

514
00:25:48,941 --> 00:25:49,966
How do you know?

515
00:25:50,009 --> 00:25:50,999
Your hands.

516
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,484
You're not bad at this.

517
00:25:56,524 --> 00:26:01,297
You're right, my last job was
at a replicator plant on Bajor.

518
00:26:01,334 --> 00:26:02,894
You're not allowed
to quit those jobs.

519
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:03,905
What happened?

520
00:26:03,939 --> 00:26:06,069
I hit a supervisor...

521
00:26:06,111 --> 00:26:08,344
for trying...

522
00:26:08,383 --> 00:26:10,911
what I thought you were trying
a few minutes ago.

523
00:26:12,492 --> 00:26:15,954
Oh, well, I appreciate
your restraint this time.

524
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,496
You're not planning on leaving
the station soon?

525
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:21,944
If I were, would you have
the Cardassians stop me?

526
00:26:21,979 --> 00:26:23,972
Yes.

527
00:26:24,018 --> 00:26:27,583
Then, I'm not planning
on leaving the station soon.

528
00:26:30,164 --> 00:26:32,397
Let me tell you something.

529
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:35,910
"Unofficially" or not, you're
working for the Cardassians.

530
00:26:35,944 --> 00:26:37,675
Sooner or later, you're going

531
00:26:37,714 --> 00:26:40,015
to have to choose
whose side you're on.

532
00:26:40,053 --> 00:26:42,650
I don't choose sides.

533
00:26:42,692 --> 00:26:46,427
Everyone has to choose sides,
Constable.

534
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,146
I don't know
what you're talking about.

535
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:59,354
You knew nothing about a list?

536
00:26:59,395 --> 00:27:00,385
Nothing.

537
00:27:02,869 --> 00:27:08,837
Why would your husband have
hidden a list of Bajoran names?

538
00:27:08,882 --> 00:27:09,850
I can't imagine why.

539
00:27:09,885 --> 00:27:10,944
Are you sure it was his?

540
00:27:10,987 --> 00:27:12,012
No.

541
00:27:12,056 --> 00:27:14,049
Maybe the Cardassians
put it there

542
00:27:14,094 --> 00:27:15,323
before they left.

543
00:27:15,363 --> 00:27:20,568
Someone on Bajor told Quark
where to find it.

544
00:27:20,608 --> 00:27:22,077
I wish I could help.

545
00:27:22,111 --> 00:27:24,138
I sort of liked
that little Ferengi.

546
00:27:24,183 --> 00:27:26,016
Well, don't write
his eulogy yet.

547
00:27:26,054 --> 00:27:27,421
He's still with us.

548
00:27:27,457 --> 00:27:28,584
I thought you said...

549
00:27:28,626 --> 00:27:31,120
He was shot
at point-blank range.

550
00:27:31,165 --> 00:27:32,998
The Federation doctor
saved his life.

551
00:27:33,035 --> 00:27:34,629
Good for him.

552
00:27:34,672 --> 00:27:38,909
Does the name "Ches'so"
mean anything to you?

553
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:41,044
I don't think so.

554
00:27:41,087 --> 00:27:42,351
Who is it?

555
00:27:42,389 --> 00:27:45,328
Oh, just someone
I'd like to talk to.

556
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:47,356
Thank you for seeing me.

557
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,965
If this has anything to do
with my husband's murder

558
00:27:51,009 --> 00:27:53,708
I want to be of help
in any way I can.

559
00:27:53,748 --> 00:27:56,083
Oh, there was one other thing.

560
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,753
I understand your power
was recently terminated

561
00:27:59,794 --> 00:28:01,354
for lack of payment.

562
00:28:01,398 --> 00:28:03,733
That's right.

563
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:06,105
Yet, you were able
to transfer funds

564
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:08,375
to the power company
this morning.

565
00:28:08,414 --> 00:28:12,355
I don't appreciate you looking
into my private affairs.

566
00:28:12,388 --> 00:28:15,087
Just part
of a routine investigation.

567
00:28:15,128 --> 00:28:18,499
If you could tell me
where you got the money.

568
00:28:18,536 --> 00:28:21,509
A loan from a friend.

569
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:22,668
Of course.

570
00:28:22,712 --> 00:28:25,343
And your friend's name?

571
00:28:25,384 --> 00:28:29,416
Odo, this really has nothing
to do with your investigation.

572
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:33,526
Good, then you won't
mind giving me the name.

573
00:28:33,635 --> 00:28:35,799
I'm sorry,
my friend is married.

574
00:28:35,841 --> 00:28:37,743
I won't drag him into this.

575
00:28:55,116 --> 00:28:57,451
Security Log, supplemental.

576
00:28:57,487 --> 00:29:02,396
The Ferengi holds on to life
like it's gold-pressed latinum.

577
00:29:02,431 --> 00:29:05,028
Maybe he just doesn't want
his brother to get the bar.

578
00:29:05,071 --> 00:29:09,206
Or maybe he knows he's
the only real witness I have.

579
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,650
The next several hours
will tell the whole story.

580
00:29:11,686 --> 00:29:15,057
We've done everything
we can for him.

581
00:29:15,093 --> 00:29:17,063
I'll keep you updated.

582
00:29:23,812 --> 00:29:25,782
I've got some good news
and some bad news.

583
00:29:25,816 --> 00:29:27,149
I think I found our Ches'so.

584
00:29:27,186 --> 00:29:28,211
Who is he?

585
00:29:28,255 --> 00:29:30,225
A Bajoran mining engineer.

586
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,228
He's been very active

587
00:29:31,262 --> 00:29:32,526
in charity work
for the war orphans.

588
00:29:32,565 --> 00:29:34,398
What makes you think
he's our man?

589
00:29:34,436 --> 00:29:36,873
Some connections from my past
suggested he might be.

590
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:39,072
His work brought him
to the station a lot.

591
00:29:39,112 --> 00:29:40,581
The bad news is, he's dead.

592
00:29:40,616 --> 00:29:43,349
Drowned in a pond
on his property last night.

593
00:29:45,093 --> 00:29:46,357
I'm responsible.

594
00:29:46,395 --> 00:29:47,624
How?

595
00:29:47,732 --> 00:29:51,228
I mentioned the name "Ches'so"
to the Vaatrik woman.

596
00:29:51,273 --> 00:29:53,642
If she recognized it
as "Ches'sarro"

597
00:29:53,745 --> 00:29:56,649
and thought that he might
lead us to her...

598
00:29:56,717 --> 00:29:58,482
Security to the Infirmary.

599
00:29:58,522 --> 00:30:00,014
Acknowledged.

600
00:30:00,058 --> 00:30:01,789
Major, I need some help.

601
00:30:01,829 --> 00:30:03,024
Advise the medical examiner

602
00:30:03,065 --> 00:30:05,161
that I want a complete
autopsy on Ches'sarro.

603
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:06,171
And that his death

604
00:30:06,205 --> 00:30:08,438
is to be treated
as a suspected homicide.

605
00:30:08,477 --> 00:30:10,413
I'll need
the communication records

606
00:30:10,448 --> 00:30:12,851
for the Vaatrik home
for the past 52 hours.

607
00:30:12,887 --> 00:30:14,356
And have the central bank

608
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,520
keep a supervisor
on duty all night.

609
00:30:16,561 --> 00:30:18,360
I'll need several
bank records, as well.

610
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:19,833
Whose?

611
00:30:19,868 --> 00:30:21,360
I don't know yet.

612
00:30:24,713 --> 00:30:27,709
I want round-the-clock
armed security on Quark.

613
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,153
No visitors.

614
00:30:29,189 --> 00:30:30,282
Yes, sir.

615
00:30:32,496 --> 00:30:34,660
Stop by one of the holosuites.

616
00:30:34,701 --> 00:30:36,934
Two programs
for the price of one.

617
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:52,069
I'm looking for the proprietor
of this establishment.

618
00:30:54,412 --> 00:30:55,745
Does he owe you money?

619
00:30:55,781 --> 00:30:57,080
No.

620
00:30:57,117 --> 00:30:58,484
Are you here to arrest him?

621
00:30:58,521 --> 00:30:59,750
No.

622
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,954
Then you've found him.

623
00:31:01,995 --> 00:31:04,330
Quark, at your service.

624
00:31:04,367 --> 00:31:05,927
First drink on the house.

625
00:31:05,969 --> 00:31:08,030
An old, dreadful
Cardassian tradition.

626
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:09,202
What'll you have?

627
00:31:09,243 --> 00:31:10,336
I don't drink.

628
00:31:11,649 --> 00:31:14,018
A soft drink, then.

629
00:31:14,054 --> 00:31:15,990
I don't drink.

630
00:31:16,026 --> 00:31:19,158
I guess that's why we don't
see you around here much.

631
00:31:19,199 --> 00:31:21,568
I'd like to ask you
a few questions

632
00:31:21,604 --> 00:31:24,303
about the death
of the Bajoran chemist.

633
00:31:24,344 --> 00:31:25,312
Wait a minute.

634
00:31:25,346 --> 00:31:27,783
You're the shape-shifter.

635
00:31:27,818 --> 00:31:31,553
You're the one
who's working for Dukat.

636
00:31:31,593 --> 00:31:34,121
I'm not working for Dukat.

637
00:31:34,165 --> 00:31:37,434
I'm just trying
to solve a murder.

638
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:40,502
No, I've heard about you.

639
00:31:40,546 --> 00:31:44,612
You do some
Cardassian neck trick.

640
00:31:44,655 --> 00:31:46,454
Am I right?

641
00:31:46,492 --> 00:31:47,825
Not anymore.

642
00:31:47,929 --> 00:31:49,831
That could go over big
in this room.

643
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:54,433
I'm checking on the alibi
of a young Bajoran woman

644
00:31:54,477 --> 00:31:57,005
red hair, named Kira Nerys.

645
00:31:57,049 --> 00:31:58,484
She says she was here
last night.

646
00:31:58,518 --> 00:31:59,486
Yeah, I remember her.

647
00:31:59,521 --> 00:32:00,216
She wanted a job.

648
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:00,977
How long was she here?

649
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:03,206
Long enough.

650
00:32:03,248 --> 00:32:05,275
Long enough for what?

651
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:07,084
Oh, you know.

652
00:32:07,123 --> 00:32:08,318
No, I don't.

653
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,592
Why don't you tell me?

654
00:32:10,631 --> 00:32:16,668
She was showing me
her... initiative.

655
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:20,343
Is that some sort
of sexual reference?

656
00:32:20,419 --> 00:32:24,154
These jobs are hard to come by.

657
00:32:24,194 --> 00:32:29,194
Her credentials
were, um, very impressive.

658
00:32:30,173 --> 00:32:31,163
Hey, listen!

659
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:33,077
Listen here,
what's the problem?

660
00:32:33,114 --> 00:32:34,777
The problem is, you're lying.

661
00:32:34,817 --> 00:32:35,785
You got me all wrong.

662
00:32:35,819 --> 00:32:36,980
I want the truth.

663
00:32:37,022 --> 00:32:39,015
Otherwise, I'll just
turn you over to Dukat

664
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,324
and he can get it for me.

665
00:32:40,363 --> 00:32:41,730
Okay, fine, I didn't realize

666
00:32:41,765 --> 00:32:43,667
we were dealing
with a murder here.

667
00:32:43,704 --> 00:32:46,369
She didn't pay me enough
for that anyway.

668
00:32:49,182 --> 00:32:52,553
She paid you for an alibi?

669
00:32:52,589 --> 00:32:54,685
I wonder how Gul Dukat

670
00:32:54,728 --> 00:32:57,393
will react when I tell
him about that?

671
00:32:57,433 --> 00:33:01,168
I'm sure it'll cost me
a case of Cardassian ale.

672
00:33:01,209 --> 00:33:03,179
Two cases at the very least.

673
00:33:03,213 --> 00:33:04,272
A broken alibi?

674
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,182
That sounds like progress.

675
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,953
Is there someone
you want me to arrest?

676
00:33:08,992 --> 00:33:10,153
Not yet.

677
00:33:10,195 --> 00:33:11,163
But soon.

678
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:13,259
I need a name, Odo.

679
00:33:13,302 --> 00:33:14,965
You'll get your name

680
00:33:15,005 --> 00:33:18,069
when I'm certain
it's the right name.

681
00:33:18,112 --> 00:33:21,517
Listen to the way
he speaks to me, Quark.

682
00:33:21,553 --> 00:33:25,927
You're not afraid of anyone,
are you, shape-shifter?

683
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:27,990
Not even me.

684
00:33:28,034 --> 00:33:30,164
I was right about you.

685
00:33:30,205 --> 00:33:33,576
You are the man for this job.

686
00:33:34,616 --> 00:33:36,347
Listen, I feel you and I...

687
00:33:36,386 --> 00:33:38,755
we've gotten off
to a bad start here.

688
00:33:38,791 --> 00:33:40,658
Let me make it up to you.

689
00:33:40,695 --> 00:33:42,791
You need anything?

690
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:44,132
A little ginger tea?

691
00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:45,832
No, you don't drink.

692
00:33:45,873 --> 00:33:49,244
Um... chocolate?

693
00:33:49,281 --> 00:33:52,846
Maybe, uh, companionship?

694
00:34:08,489 --> 00:34:11,690
You look like you just lost
your best friend, Constable.

695
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:13,222
Is Quark, uh...

696
00:34:13,267 --> 00:34:15,260
Quark is stable.

697
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:16,272
What's this?

698
00:34:16,307 --> 00:34:17,332
The list.

699
00:34:17,376 --> 00:34:18,902
You found it?

700
00:34:18,946 --> 00:34:19,971
No, I assembled it

701
00:34:20,015 --> 00:34:21,985
from the Vaatrik woman's
communication records.

702
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:24,490
She's been talking to each
of these people a lot.

703
00:34:24,592 --> 00:34:26,061
Odd thing is, she had never

704
00:34:26,095 --> 00:34:28,430
talked to any of them
until two days ago.

705
00:34:28,467 --> 00:34:30,061
When the list was stolen.

706
00:34:30,104 --> 00:34:31,733
Interestingly,
every one of them

707
00:34:31,774 --> 00:34:34,713
has transferred exactly
100,000 Bajoran <i>litas</i>

708
00:34:34,748 --> 00:34:37,778
into her bank account
within the last 26 hours.

709
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,788
Blackmail?

710
00:34:38,823 --> 00:34:39,791
Blackmail.

711
00:34:39,825 --> 00:34:41,818
What did they have to hide?

712
00:34:41,863 --> 00:34:44,027
For one thing, that they'd
come out of the occupation

713
00:34:44,068 --> 00:34:46,038
with that kind of money.

714
00:34:46,072 --> 00:34:47,939
You think they were working
with the Cardassians.

715
00:34:47,977 --> 00:34:51,417
Selling out their own world
for a profit.

716
00:34:51,451 --> 00:34:52,680
Collaborators.

717
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,521
Not even a Ferengi
would do that.

718
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,724
It explains a lot of things.

719
00:34:57,764 --> 00:34:59,199
Do you have enough
to charge her?

720
00:34:59,234 --> 00:35:00,669
Not yet

721
00:35:00,704 --> 00:35:02,834
but I'd like to bring her
in for questioning.

722
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:03,968
With your permission

723
00:35:04,012 --> 00:35:06,985
I'll ask the Bajoran authorities
to transport her here.

724
00:35:26,093 --> 00:35:30,364
Nobody ever had to teach me
the "justice trick."

725
00:35:30,402 --> 00:35:32,566
That's something
I've always known.

726
00:35:32,674 --> 00:35:36,079
A racial memory
from my species, I guess.

727
00:35:36,115 --> 00:35:40,352
It's really the only clue I have
to what kind of people they are.

728
00:35:40,391 --> 00:35:45,198
Are these kinds of thoughts
appropriate for a Starfleet log?

729
00:35:45,235 --> 00:35:47,068
I don't care.

730
00:35:48,676 --> 00:35:51,307
There's no room in justice

731
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:54,811
for loyalty
or friendship or love.

732
00:35:54,857 --> 00:35:59,026
Justice, as the humans
like to say, is blind.

733
00:35:59,066 --> 00:36:00,968
I used to believe that.

734
00:36:01,003 --> 00:36:04,670
I'm not sure I can anymore.

735
00:36:04,712 --> 00:36:07,309
Yes, I lied about my alibi.

736
00:36:07,351 --> 00:36:10,290
That doesn't make me a killer.

737
00:36:10,324 --> 00:36:12,693
Where were you
when he was murdered?

738
00:36:12,729 --> 00:36:15,827
Asleep, alone.

739
00:36:15,869 --> 00:36:18,773
No one saw you
in the community quarters?

740
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:19,777
I wasn't there.

741
00:36:19,812 --> 00:36:21,577
I found a small corner and...

742
00:36:21,616 --> 00:36:23,381
You're lying.

743
00:36:23,419 --> 00:36:24,387
I...

744
00:36:24,421 --> 00:36:25,411
Don't bother.

745
00:36:25,457 --> 00:36:27,393
Your whole face changes.

746
00:36:27,428 --> 00:36:29,797
I should have seen it before.

747
00:36:29,834 --> 00:36:31,360
You don't lie well.

748
00:36:31,404 --> 00:36:34,969
Thanks.

749
00:36:35,012 --> 00:36:37,609
So why don't you
start telling the truth?

750
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:42,525
Whose side are you going
to be on, Constable?

751
00:36:42,561 --> 00:36:44,155
I'm not going to play your game.

752
00:36:44,198 --> 00:36:46,396
When I tell you the truth,
you'll have to choose.

753
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:48,670
No, no, that's why
I was given this job.

754
00:36:48,775 --> 00:36:51,907
That's why all of you
always come to me with problems.

755
00:36:51,948 --> 00:36:52,938
I'm the outsider.

756
00:36:52,984 --> 00:36:54,213
I'm on no one's side.

757
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:56,156
All I'm interested
in is justice.

758
00:36:56,191 --> 00:36:58,218
If you're innocent,
you'll go free.

759
00:36:58,263 --> 00:37:01,395
If not, I'll turn you over
to Cardassian authorities.

760
00:37:01,437 --> 00:37:04,136
That's the only choice here.

761
00:37:09,253 --> 00:37:11,155
I didn't kill him.

762
00:37:13,663 --> 00:37:18,663
When he was killed,
I was on Level 21.

763
00:37:18,741 --> 00:37:21,771
21? Ore processing?

764
00:37:21,814 --> 00:37:24,081
Check the Cardassian
security logs.

765
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,614
You'll see a breach
on 21 last night.

766
00:37:32,203 --> 00:37:33,695
I'm in the Bajoran underground.

767
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,642
I came here to commit
acts of sabotage

768
00:37:35,678 --> 00:37:36,907
against the Cardassians.

769
00:37:36,947 --> 00:37:38,211
Last night, I succeeded.

770
00:37:40,121 --> 00:37:44,826
The ore processor was damaged
by a sub-nucleonic device

771
00:37:44,865 --> 00:37:46,129
at 2500 hours last night.

772
00:37:46,168 --> 00:37:50,007
It'll be out of operation
for two weeks.

773
00:37:50,043 --> 00:37:54,041
Give the mine workers
a little time off at least.

774
00:37:54,085 --> 00:37:58,721
I'll describe the device I used
if you still don't believe me.

775
00:37:58,762 --> 00:38:02,258
That's why you needed
an alibi from Quark.

776
00:38:02,303 --> 00:38:04,706
If you tell the Cardassians
the truth

777
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:06,404
none of this will matter.

778
00:38:06,445 --> 00:38:08,643
I'll be executed
for the sabotage.

779
00:38:08,684 --> 00:38:11,383
Who cares about Bajorans
killing Bajorans

780
00:38:11,423 --> 00:38:13,188
when you can hang a rebel?

781
00:38:17,102 --> 00:38:18,696
Is this her?

782
00:38:18,739 --> 00:38:20,504
I told you
when I have the name...

783
00:38:20,543 --> 00:38:22,172
Is this her?

784
00:38:27,792 --> 00:38:28,760
No.

785
00:38:28,794 --> 00:38:30,890
You can go.

786
00:38:38,283 --> 00:38:40,584
If you're lying,
shape-shifter...

787
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:44,789
If you know as much about me
as you say you do, Gul Dukat

788
00:38:44,863 --> 00:38:46,457
you know I don't lie.

789
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,940
I am convinced
that she did not kill Vaatrik.

790
00:39:11,455 --> 00:39:12,788
Is it too late for visitors?

791
00:39:12,825 --> 00:39:13,793
I'm sorry, sir.

792
00:39:13,827 --> 00:39:15,126
No visitors are permitted here.

793
00:39:15,163 --> 00:39:17,065
Then perhaps you could just
put these in water for him?

794
00:39:17,101 --> 00:39:18,812
Of course...

795
00:39:50,281 --> 00:39:51,614
Odo to Bashir.

796
00:39:51,651 --> 00:39:53,177
Report to the Infirmary
immediately.

797
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,188
On my way.

798
00:39:54,223 --> 00:39:55,624
It's over, Rom.

799
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:56,626
Over!

800
00:39:56,729 --> 00:39:57,788
You're a hero.

801
00:39:57,831 --> 00:39:59,130
I am?

802
00:39:59,168 --> 00:40:01,298
You saved your brother's life.

803
00:40:29,467 --> 00:40:32,268
I've never seen him before
in my life.

804
00:40:32,306 --> 00:40:33,274
Really?

805
00:40:33,308 --> 00:40:35,175
Your communication records
indicate

806
00:40:35,213 --> 00:40:37,309
that you made several
calls to his home

807
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:38,843
and received several as well.

808
00:40:38,888 --> 00:40:41,986
You also transferred
a large sum of money

809
00:40:42,028 --> 00:40:44,397
into his account two days ago.

810
00:40:44,434 --> 00:40:46,905
I want to confer
with my advocate.

811
00:40:46,939 --> 00:40:48,066
Certainly.

812
00:40:48,108 --> 00:40:50,739
I'll make arrangements
for you to speak with him.

813
00:40:50,814 --> 00:40:52,340
Meantime, the two of you

814
00:40:52,384 --> 00:40:54,947
can introduce yourselves
to one another.

815
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:06,010
I don't care what you think
you know, shape-shifter.

816
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:10,149
You will never be able to prove
that I killed my husband

817
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,489
because I didn't.

818
00:41:12,528 --> 00:41:13,929
I know.

819
00:41:33,808 --> 00:41:36,644
When did you realize?

820
00:41:36,681 --> 00:41:38,674
The possibility occurred to me

821
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:41,749
when you got the name
Ches'sarro so quickly.

822
00:41:41,793 --> 00:41:44,026
Your friends
from the underground

823
00:41:44,064 --> 00:41:47,799
must have already suspected him
of being a collaborator.

824
00:41:47,906 --> 00:41:53,077
Once I knew the eight names
were a list of collaborators

825
00:41:53,117 --> 00:41:57,024
the murder of Vaatrik
made sense for the first time.

826
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:00,465
He must have been
a collaborator, too.

827
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,473
He had the money for ginger tea.

828
00:42:03,507 --> 00:42:06,070
He had the private quarters.

829
00:42:06,113 --> 00:42:10,578
I never had a motive
for his murder until now.

830
00:42:10,623 --> 00:42:13,356
He kept his wife
in relative luxury.

831
00:42:13,395 --> 00:42:16,425
She surely
wouldn't have killed him.

832
00:42:16,469 --> 00:42:20,102
So who would kill
a Cardassian collaborator?

833
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:25,985
Someone in the Bajoran
underground, of course.

834
00:42:30,233 --> 00:42:32,568
A colleague of mine
was given the job

835
00:42:32,604 --> 00:42:34,665
of sabotaging the ore processor.

836
00:42:34,709 --> 00:42:36,679
Vaatrik was my responsibility.

837
00:42:36,713 --> 00:42:38,444
You were here to execute him.

838
00:42:38,484 --> 00:42:39,452
No.

839
00:42:39,486 --> 00:42:40,978
I was here to find the list.

840
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:43,722
The names of the Bajorans
who were selling us out.

841
00:42:43,762 --> 00:42:48,136
We'd been informed that Vaatrik
was their direct link to Dukat.

842
00:42:48,172 --> 00:42:49,835
Ah...

843
00:42:49,875 --> 00:42:54,214
That must have been why Dukat
chose me to investigate.

844
00:42:54,251 --> 00:42:57,986
He had to stay as far away
from this incident as he could

845
00:42:58,027 --> 00:43:01,798
so as not to endanger his
network of Bajoran sympathizers.

846
00:43:01,835 --> 00:43:04,831
Obviously, I never found
the list.

847
00:43:04,908 --> 00:43:07,641
But that's what I was
looking for in his shop

848
00:43:07,681 --> 00:43:09,480
when Vaatrik walked in on me.

849
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:12,218
I didn't have a choice.

850
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,353
I misjudged you, Major.

851
00:43:15,399 --> 00:43:19,773
You were a better liar
than I gave you credit for.

852
00:43:19,808 --> 00:43:22,405
You were working
for the Cardassians.

853
00:43:22,447 --> 00:43:24,884
I haven't been
for more than a year.

854
00:43:24,986 --> 00:43:28,221
You've had all that time
to tell me the truth.

855
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:32,099
I tried to tell you
the truth a hundred times.

856
00:43:35,676 --> 00:43:38,808
What you think of me...

857
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:40,649
matters a lot.

858
00:43:46,433 --> 00:43:48,768
I was afraid...

859
00:43:48,805 --> 00:43:52,074
That it might affect
our friendship?

860
00:44:02,668 --> 00:44:04,729
Maybe it doesn't have to.

861
00:44:09,818 --> 00:44:14,123
Will you ever be able
to trust me the same way again?
