1
00:00:01,502 --> 00:00:03,629
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Last time on</i>
Deep Space Nine...

2
00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:06,757
SISKO:<i> This is the emblem</i>
<i>of  the Alliance</i>
<i>for Global Unity.</i>

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,550
They call themselves
the Circle.

4
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:10,719
What gives them the right
to mess up our station?

5
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:12,888
They're an extremist faction

6
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,140
who believe in Bajor
for the Bajorans.

7
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:16,892
I can't loan you
a Starfleet runabout

8
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:19,144
without knowing
where you plan on taking it.

9
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:20,688
To Cardassia IV

10
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,940
to rescue
a Bajoran prisoner of war.

11
00:00:22,982 --> 00:00:24,692
(<i> grunts</i> )

12
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:29,404
Come on, we have
a ship waiting.

13
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,782
What if I told you
that I knew someone

14
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:33,617
who could bring stability
to Bajor?

15
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:35,953
Someone who could
unite the factions

16
00:00:35,995 --> 00:00:37,538
and give us a chance
to do our job.

17
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,248
But Bajor doesn't
need a man.

18
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,334
It needs a symbol

19
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,670
and that's
what you are.

20
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:48,007
The Navarch needed to return
here to assume his new post.

21
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:51,510
He's been made the Bajoran
Liaison Officer
to Deep Space 9.

22
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:54,137
I already have
a Liaison Officer.

23
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,973
Not anymore,
you don't.

24
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:58,392
Major Kira is no longer
assigned to this post.

25
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:01,102
She's been recalled to Bajor.

26
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,771
QUARK:
It's over,
everything.

27
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:04,398
Bajor, the provisional
government

28
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,734
the Federation being
here-- all of it.

29
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,402
We gotta leave.

30
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:11,112
The provisional government
will stand only if the military

31
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,573
supports it.

32
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,533
We are all patriots, Commander.

33
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:15,826
I am the Circle, Major.

34
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:18,662
How can you
betray your own government?

35
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,087
The Circle's being supplied
by the Cardassians.

36
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,339
What?

37
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,425
I... borrowed the proof.

38
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,844
It's got a gul's thumb scan
on it.

39
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:35,596
The Circle hates
the Cardassians.

40
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:38,015
They don't know
it<i> is</i> the Cardassians.

41
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:39,516
They think
they've been buying

42
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:41,100
from Kressari traders.

43
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:44,103
Think of the prestige of having
the new leader of Bajor

44
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,065
being a member of your order.

45
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,819
If you<i> are</i> the new leader.

46
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:53,030
Commander, two assault
vessels are headed this way

47
00:01:53,072 --> 00:01:54,990
on direct course
from Bajor.

48
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,450
They've given
all non-Bajorans

49
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,993
seven hours to evacuate.

50
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:00,829
ANNOUNCER:
<i>And now, the conclusion.</i>

51
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:06,043
Starfleet feels it has
no other choice.

52
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:08,420
The Federation is here
at the invitation

53
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,714
of the Bajoran
provisional government.

54
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:13,174
No more provisional government,
no more invitation.

55
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:16,344
Governments can break off
relations with an edict.

56
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,930
It's not so easy

57
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:20,307
when it comes down
to our level, hmm?

58
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,225
Lieutenant Bilecki here

59
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:25,186
is engaged to a young
man from Bajor.

60
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,855
Ensign Kelly.

61
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,774
Ensign Kelly's daughter

62
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,567
worked together
with a young Bajoran girl

63
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:32,820
on a prize-winning
science fair project.

64
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,864
All of us who have served
on the station for
the past year

65
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,616
have made Bajoran friends.

66
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:40,285
We've come to care about
what happens to these people.

67
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,370
I know I do.

68
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,082
So I've decided to stay.

69
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:46,458
(<i> muttering</i> )

70
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,793
Just to make sure

71
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,878
the evacuation
is conducted properly.

72
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,089
You'll need someone

73
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:54,299
to oversee the
inventory process, sir.

74
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,010
Packing away
all my medical supplies

75
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:59,178
could take, uh, quite
a while, Commander.

76
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,306
(<i> mutters of support</i> )

77
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,767
Before you volunteer
too quickly

78
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:06,103
understand
what you're getting into.

79
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:08,563
We'll be trying to delay
the takeover of the station

80
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,564
as long as possible.

81
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,316
Hopefully, as long as it takes

82
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:14,486
to expose the Cardassians'
involvement in all of this.

83
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:17,322
It won't be easy.

84
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,908
The Bajoran assault forces
have been told

85
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,786
that the Federation
is their blood enemy.

86
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:27,708
Jaro and the Circle
would love nothing more

87
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,502
than to have my head,
and yours

88
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,505
and present them
to the Chamber of Ministers.

89
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:37,551
This is your last chance
to leave here in one piece.

90
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:40,888
Some of you have families.

91
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,473
Some are
on temporary assignment.

92
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:44,808
I wouldn't blame anyone

93
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,476
for getting out now
while you can.

94
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:49,229
I mean that.

95
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:54,068
Anyone who wants to evacuate
is dismissed.

96
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:05,204
Non-Bajorans
won't be safe here.

97
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,289
Our families, children,
have to be evacuated.

98
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,834
I'm sure many of the Bajorans
who have worked with us

99
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,377
will want to leave, too.

100
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,839
There is a lot to get done.

101
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:19,384
The assault vessels
will be here
in less than five hours.

102
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,553
Dismissed.

103
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,724
(<i> buzz of conversation</i> )

104
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:48,575
Hundreds of people
to evacuate

105
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:51,203
and only three tiny
runabouts available.

106
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:54,081
Do you know
what that means?

107
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,583
It... it means...

108
00:06:56,624 --> 00:07:00,545
Well, a lot of people
will be left behind.

109
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,589
Tragic. Yes, brother.

110
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,050
Your compassion
never ceases to amaze me.

111
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:07,802
It means we're going
to make a fortune.

112
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,554
We are?

113
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:13,600
People will pay anything
for a seat on those ships.

114
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,602
You can't make me...

115
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,604
Well, I won't
sell<i> my</i> seat.

116
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,897
Rom.

117
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,899
No! I won't stay
and be killed

118
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,817
just to fill your pockets.

119
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,945
Rom, do you
actually believe

120
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:29,157
that I would sacrifice
my own brother's life...

121
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,203
for personal profit?

122
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,711
It would have to be
the deal of a lifetime.

123
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,130
Yes,<i> my</i> lifetime.

124
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,589
Listen to me.

125
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,716
We're both
going to escape...

126
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:49,052
but our bags
will be filled

127
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:52,431
with all the gold-pressed
latinum we can carry.

128
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:00,563
Nog!

129
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,607
I've been looking
all over for you.

130
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:03,650
What ship you on?

131
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,818
<i>Rio Grande.</i>

132
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,194
I'm on the<i> Ganges.</i>

133
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,655
Oh. Well, it'll be okay.

134
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,198
We'll see each other
at the Hanolan colony

135
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,366
in a few days.

136
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:12,826
That's not where I'm going.

137
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,702
But my dad told me...

138
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,871
My ship's going
to the Korat system.

139
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,082
I guess that's
where they're taking
all the Starfleet families.

140
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,670
Well, this will be
over in no time.

141
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:26,298
We'll be back in school
driving Mrs. O'Brien crazy

142
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,632
in a few days.

143
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,843
Just when I think
I've found a new home

144
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,094
and a new friend

145
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,887
it always seems
like I got to leave.

146
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,432
Hey, hu-man...

147
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:37,058
Cut it out!

148
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,479
Has there ever been
one of your kind

149
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,605
and one of my kind
who were better friends?

150
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,441
Never.

151
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:46,401
And if our fathers

152
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,195
couldn't break us up

153
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,155
no stupid coupe day... coupe...

154
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,823
Coup d'état.

155
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,241
It's French.

156
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,535
Well, no stupid
French thing will, either.

157
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,787
We'll see each other
again soon.

158
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,331
That's a promise.

159
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:01,458
Mr. Sisko, Nog--

160
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,793
this is no time
to be fooling about.

161
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,962
Get yourselves to wherever
you're supposed to be.

162
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,643
Is that everything?

163
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,396
Sure.

164
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,939
Oh, Keiko, please.
Don't go like this.

165
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,066
Like what?

166
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,692
I don't have any choice.

167
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:28,943
Don't you?

168
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:29,944
He needs me.

169
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,571
We<i> don't?</i>

170
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:34,074
We can't just let the Cardies
have the wormhole.

171
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,951
They could have the
whole Gamma Quadrant
for all I care.

172
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,499
Miles...

173
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,878
come with us.

174
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,963
Where are we going?

175
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,882
On a ride, sweetheart.

176
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,717
Are you coming,
too, Daddy?

177
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,262
Soon, baby.

178
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:58,056
I'll come as
soon as I can.

179
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:07,399
I'll walk you to the airlock.

180
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,034
DAX:
I've scanned every subspace
communication window

181
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:19,536
to find
a frequency to Bajor.

182
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:21,246
They've got them
completely jammed.

183
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,664
Then we have no choice.

184
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,209
We'll have to take the proof
to the Chamber of Ministers.

185
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,211
Jaro's forces
will be scanning

186
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,504
for any incoming vessels.

187
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,881
A runabout could handle
a Bajoran patrol.

188
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:34,050
Unfortunately,
I don't have one to give you.

189
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:35,843
The Lunar V base?

190
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,596
You think there's still
a ship there?

191
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,432
We managed to get
a few subimpulse raiders
underground

192
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:43,518
before the Cardassians hit us,
but that was ten years ago.

193
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,312
Could one
of the evacuation vessels

194
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,230
take a detour and drop me off?

195
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,357
What if you get there
and those raiders won't fly?

196
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:52,026
Then I'll have to wait
until I hear from you, I guess.

197
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,737
You may have to wait
a long time.

198
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,657
Dax...

199
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:01,035
do any of your former
hosts have experience

200
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,371
with subimpulse
thruster configurations?

201
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:04,914
Yes. Tobin Dax.

202
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:07,626
Tobin? I don't think
I've heard about this one.

203
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,085
My second host.

204
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,463
Barely a sex life,
and no imagination

205
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:14,508
but he knew phase
coil inverters
like no one else.

206
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:17,260
Major Kira could use
his experience today.

207
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,053
I have no time
for this foolishness.

208
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,221
I still have to pack.

209
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:21,889
SISKO:
What's the problem?

210
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,225
He's been brokering seats
on the evacuation vessels.

211
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,894
Where did you
get more seats?

212
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,855
Everybody always
asks the brokers

213
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,316
where they get
their extra seats.

214
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:32,984
And all I can say
is it's my business

215
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,236
to find preferred seating
for a select list of clients...

216
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:36,904
I have got more
than 200 people

217
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,781
who want to get
off this station.

218
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,617
Where did you
get more seats?!

219
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:42,910
A few trades.

220
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,997
A person here or there
who changed his mind
about leaving

221
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,416
at the sight
of a reasonable stipend.

222
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:51,044
BASHIR:
<i>Bashir to Commander Sisko.</i>
Go ahead.

223
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,588
We're having a bit of a panic
at the airlock, sir.

224
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,840
Far more passengers than
we can handle have shown up

225
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:59,594
<i>and they all claim to have</i>
<i>made arrangements to leave.</i>

226
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:02,180
I might have overbooked,
slightly.

227
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:06,476
On my way.

228
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:10,397
It's an accepted
Ferengi transit practice.

229
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,692
I feel perfectly justified.

230
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:17,487
I have complete faith
in Commander Sisko's ability
to straighten this out.

231
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,113
I'll pass that on.

232
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,824
He'll be so pleased to know
that he has your confidence.

233
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:26,079
As I'm no longer needed
my brother is waiting for
me on the ship.

234
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,622
(<i> scoffs</i> )

235
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,292
Hey, Odo.

236
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:33,712
You'll miss me.

237
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:34,837
You know you will.
Say it.

238
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,298
I'll miss you, Quark.

239
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,799
You said it!

240
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,218
I'll miss the aggravation

241
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,136
the petty theft,
the bad manners...

242
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,682
Odo... take care of yourself.

243
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,269
(<i> laughing</i> )

244
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,442
(<i> shouting</i> )

245
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,151
Don't you understand?!

246
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,237
There isn't room for everyone.

247
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,780
We have to get our families,
our children

248
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,617
and non-Bajorans...

249
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,621
Where are you running to?!

250
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,750
This is Bajor.

251
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,753
We are Bajorans.

252
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:19,591
We fought a war
to regain our homeland.

253
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:24,345
How can you abandon it
like frightened Cardassian
vole?

254
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,514
These ships
are for our guests

255
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:27,974
who<i> must</i> leave

256
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,851
because it is no longer safe
for them here.

257
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,272
However, we are Bajorans...

258
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:41,195
and I say that we stay
and we solve our own problems.

259
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,905
Together.

260
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,493
Are you willing to join me?

261
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:49,120
(<i> murmurs of agreement</i> )

262
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,336
As soon as the passenger lists
are confirmed

263
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,462
get these ships
out of here.

264
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,046
They're almost ready to go,
sir.

265
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,507
The<i> Rio Grande</i> is full
and so is the<i> Orinoco.</i>

266
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,549
Get them launched.

267
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:02,925
Aye, sir.

268
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:08,807
Are you ready?

269
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:10,350
I've been thinking.

270
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,934
I really think it'd
be better if I stayed.

271
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,561
(<i> chuckles</i> )

272
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:16,230
Look, I just don't want
anything to happen to you.

273
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,065
That makes two of us.

274
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,360
What's this?

275
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,861
A letter I wrote you.

276
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:22,862
A letter?

277
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,572
Just some things.

278
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,324
I'll read it as soon
as I get on the ship.

279
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,242
Wait a while.

280
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:32,706
I'll see you in
a couple of weeks.

281
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,837
That's everyone, sir.

282
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,088
Sisko to<i> Ganges.</i>

283
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,465
Proceed with launch.

284
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:43,842
KIRA:
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

285
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,010
<i>Good luck, Commander.</i>
<i>Kira out.</i>

286
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,387
QUARK:
No! No!

287
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,429
Wait!

288
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,223
(<i> grunting</i> )

289
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,933
My ship... the<i> Rio Grande...</i>

290
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,186
my brother's on it.

291
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,937
He's got my ticket.

292
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,064
That ship was full, sir.

293
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:59,232
I checked the list myself.

294
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,567
Quark's name wasn't on it.

295
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,068
His brother Rom
did go aboard,

296
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,194
but he was
with a dabo girl.

297
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,821
A dabo girl?

298
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:06,489
What?

299
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:09,409
Looks like he
sold your seat.

300
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,289
No...

301
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,667
No, you don't understand.

302
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:20,086
You don't understand!

303
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,004
I can't stay here!

304
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,092
I'll be hung.

305
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:29,220
Call the ships back!

306
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,472
I'll pay anyone

307
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:35,560
five bars of gold-pressed
latinum for a seat!

308
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,772
Ten bars.

309
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,899
(<i> breathing heavily</i> )

310
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,358
Twenty.

311
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,737
(<i> sighs</i> )

312
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,174
Clear.

313
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,136
No resistance at all.

314
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,555
Minister Jaro's prediction
was correct.

315
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:15,475
The Federation
has tucked its tail
between its legs.

316
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:29,071
Where are the Bajoran officers
who worked with Starfleet?

317
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,574
Where is Li Nalas?

318
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,326
Perhaps they knew
this old station

319
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,702
could never
withstand a siege

320
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:37,037
and they abandoned it
with Starfleet.

321
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:42,209
The most strategic position
in the entire sector--

322
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,713
at the mouth of the wormhole.

323
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,966
Hmm.

324
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,426
Had I been Federation Commander

325
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:53,429
I would not have abandoned it
so easily.

326
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:14,826
KIRA: Can you believe,
a year ago, I was living
in a camp like this?

327
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:17,411
Only not quite so nice.

328
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,705
DAX: Have I mentioned

329
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,498
how allergic Trills are
to insect bites?

330
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,000
Really?

331
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,043
Well, the biochemical
connections

332
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:27,505
between host and symbiont
can't tolerate the... Oh!

333
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:30,008
Whoa! What's that?
Is that a spider or a dog?

334
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,300
KIRA:
<i>Palukoo.</i>

335
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:33,636
The Bajoran moons
are full of them.

336
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:36,764
Oh, I suppose you used
to make them your pets

337
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:39,058
and, uh, sing songs about them
around the campfire.

338
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,143
No. We used
to eat them.

339
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,687
There it is.

340
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,527
Are you sure this thing
is supposed to fly?

341
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,612
Oh, I've been in
a lot worse.

342
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,954
I guess
the Bajoran resistance

343
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,581
must have had
a lot of short pilots.

344
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,457
Ha, no, just
short engineers.

345
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,252
They were always
building these things
without thinking.

346
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,546
Encouraging.

347
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,214
Just bend your knees.
You'll fit.

348
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,181
Now, the real trick will be
to fire up these thrusters

349
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,934
after all this time.

350
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,309
It was hard enough
to get them going

351
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,352
when they were being used
every day.

352
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:24,729
We'll get them fired up.

353
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,898
You don't have
to worry about that.

354
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,067
Oh, you're sure, huh?

355
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,443
Yep.

356
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:33,571
I have no intention
of getting stuck here

357
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,074
eating<i> palukoos.</i>

358
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,711
We should inform Minister Jaro
of our success immediately.

359
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:51,380
KRIM:
You're too eager to receive
his plaudits, Colonel.

360
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:54,133
What's the status
of the internal security net?

361
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,427
WOMAN:
Completely disabled,
General.

362
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,554
Scan the Operations Center
for organic material.

363
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:00,098
Organic?

364
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,934
The station's Security Chief
is apparently missing.

365
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,022
The shape-shifter.

366
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:11,943
It's possible he left
with the evacuation ships

367
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:14,445
or perhaps there's
something more here

368
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,155
than meets the eye.

369
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,116
Yes, sir.

370
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:22,120
Scan six times an hour
at random intervals.

371
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,580
MAN:
Minister Jaro on subspace, sir.

372
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:26,248
Minister, I'm pleased
to inform you

373
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,208
that we've encountered
no resistance so far.

374
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,337
JARO:<i> Good news. Then</i>
<i>the Federation has withdrawn.</i>

375
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:32,546
We monitored
the evacuation

376
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,799
of three vessels
several hours ago.

377
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:37,301
<i>When I announce that we've</i>
<i>secured the station</i>

378
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,427
<i>it will certainly impact...</i>

379
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,638
Minister, I urge caution.

380
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,266
The battle for this station
hasn't even begun yet.

381
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,853
<i>Do you expect the enemy</i>
<i>to return, General?</i>

382
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,729
I'm not convinced
they ever left.

383
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:51,649
The internal security net
has been sabotaged.

384
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:55,528
We have no way of tracking the
movements of anyone on board

385
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,906
which suggests
someone didn't want

386
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,741
to be that easily found.

387
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:02,660
<i>Kira?</i>

388
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:05,496
Perhaps.
She is unaccounted for.

389
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,540
So, too, is Security Chief Odo.

390
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:10,751
So is Li Nalas.
<i>You're right.</i>

391
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:13,046
<i>Li Nalas would have never</i>
<i>abandoned Bajor.</i>

392
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,547
<i>He must still be there.</i>

393
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:15,923
Let me reemphasize that you are

394
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:16,966
to take every necessary step

395
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:18,759
to keep Li Nalas alive.

396
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:19,886
Dead, he's a martyr.

397
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,512
Alive, he seals our victory.

398
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,682
<i>Understood.</i>

399
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:28,936
Once you have him
Li will see the wisdom
of giving you his support.

400
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,604
I'll offer him
anything he wants

401
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:31,981
to make sure he does--

402
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:34,400
short of becoming the
next Kai, of course.

403
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:43,784
You have a unique ability
to build a consensus, Essa.

404
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:47,121
Bajor has been waiting
for a leader like you.

405
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,831
Leaders like us.

406
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:54,879
If I am so favored
by the Vedek Assembly.

407
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,757
You don't have
to worry about that.

408
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:04,555
26 hours after
I'm sworn into office

409
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:08,267
I'll direct
the Vedek Assembly
to elect you Kai.

410
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:11,729
Together, we will
rebuild Bajor.

411
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,699
You got it!

412
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:25,159
(<i> coughing</i> )

413
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,911
Don't turn the engines off.

414
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,913
We'll never get them
started again.

415
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,664
Let's go.

416
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,126
Thank you, Tobin.

417
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:34,376
Dax, come on.

418
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:35,502
(<i> grunts</i> )

419
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,963
Oh, the hell with it.

420
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,338
If it's going to fly,
it's going to fly.

421
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,673
Problem?

422
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,175
No, everything's wonderful.

423
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,718
Ow!

424
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,220
The knees.

425
00:21:44,262 --> 00:21:46,973
Oh, listen to that sound.

426
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,933
That sure brings back
some memories.

427
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:51,269
How did you ever win a war
in these things?

428
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,770
We were the insects,
Lieutenant.

429
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,647
The Cardassians were
just as allergic as Trills.

430
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:55,648
Is the proximity system
working?

431
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,233
(<i> thumps</i> )

432
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:59,277
I think so.

433
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,195
All right, let's see
if we can get out of here

434
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:03,030
without bouncing off any walls.

435
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:08,661
You're playing
right into their hands.

436
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:11,038
If you're so convinced
they're still here

437
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,666
how can you sit
and wait for them to attack?

438
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:16,543
They have no interest
in attacking.

439
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,712
What makes you
so sure?

440
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,966
Because I understand
military tactics.

441
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,343
They are vastly outnumbered.

442
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,680
If we divide
our forces...

443
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:32,392
The primary sensor array
was sabotaged, sir.

444
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:35,271
As soon as we tested it,
the sub-net shorted out.

445
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:39,733
You can let
your engineers
play with the machines.

446
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,028
I'm sending out search parties.

447
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,241
Eat hearty.

448
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:49,535
The replicators crash
in 16 minutes.

449
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,745
This will have
to last a while.

450
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,122
Combat rations, Chief?

451
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:55,749
Couldn't you have
replicated something

452
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,001
a little more palatable?

453
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,585
You don't like
combat rations?

454
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,630
A French onion soup
would have really been nice.

455
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:04,300
Miracle of science,
these little combat rations.

456
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:06,802
Timed-release formula
of all the nutrients

457
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,304
the body needs
for three days.

458
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:10,388
I love 'em.

459
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,558
The only thing I miss
about the Cardassian front.

460
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,936
Sisko to all units.

461
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:18,898
You can thank Chief of
Operations Miles O'Brien

462
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:21,275
<i>for your repast this</i>
<i>afternoon.</i>

463
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:23,694
Oh, you haven't made
any friends here, Chief.

464
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,321
Or should I say chef?

465
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:26,947
O'BRIEN:
<i>Julian!</i>

466
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:29,283
Well, I would have expected you
of all people

467
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:31,244
to appreciate
the nutritional value

468
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:32,578
of combat rations.

469
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,121
Actually, when I was
in med school,

470
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:35,706
I designed
an incredible candy bar

471
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,875
which was far superior
in food value.

472
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,126
Am I the only one

473
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:40,961
that doesn't think
this is funny?

474
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:42,588
ODO:<i> Odo to Sisko.</i>
Go ahead.

475
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:44,965
<i>Stand by.</i>
<i>There's a patrol approaching.</i>

476
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:47,009
<i>I'll get back to you</i>
<i>in a minute.</i>

477
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,899
A five-man unit

478
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,484
is about to begin
a search of the cargo deck.

479
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,070
That puts them closest to me,
Commander.

480
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:07,445
SISKO:
<i>Stand by, Doctor.</i>

481
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,823
O'BRIEN:
Maybe we should
send someone

482
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,284
with a little
more experience.

483
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:13,869
Someone who can
run the show, like Li.

484
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:16,747
SISKO: No, I need him
here with us.

485
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:21,585
Doctor, move your unit
to Cargo Bay 6.

486
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,170
You know what to do.

487
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:25,214
And let me reemphasize--

488
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:27,883
use deadly force
only if absolutely necessary.

489
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:29,593
Aye, sir.
We're on our way.

490
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,929
Happy hunting.

491
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:51,782
BASHIR:
I wouldn't get
too close to that.

492
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,867
It's thorium isotope.

493
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,497
Prolonged exposure

494
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:02,293
could have very
nasty consequences.

495
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:07,465
Bashir to Sisko.

496
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:08,548
SISKO:<i> Go ahead.</i>

497
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,009
Mission accomplished.

498
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:14,096
<i>We have our first five</i>
<i>prisoners of war.</i>

499
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:24,857
Preparing to establish

500
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,234
a high-altitude
orbit of Bajor.

501
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,487
Navigational sensors
aren't functioning.

502
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:30,570
No problem.

503
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:31,529
No problem?

504
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:32,698
Big problem.

505
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,200
Without navigational sensors...

506
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,243
We'll have to fly
by the seat of our pants.

507
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:38,496
Great.
Seat-of-the-pants technology.

508
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:41,665
You Starfleet types are too
dependent on gadgets and
gizmos.

509
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:44,584
You lose your natural instincts
for survival.

510
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,379
My natural instincts
for survival told me

511
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,796
not to climb aboard
this thing.

512
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:49,631
I'd say they were
functioning pretty well.

513
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,758
I know the terrain
of Bajor.

514
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,053
We ought to be able to
recognize a landing site...

515
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,346
(<i> explosion</i> )

516
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:56,389
What the hell was that?

517
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,515
I have no idea.

518
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:59,225
None of the sensors
are functioning.

519
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:02,353
Someone's firing at us.

520
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:04,188
Initiating evasive maneuvers.

521
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,982
I'm reading the EM signature
of an impulse engine.

522
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:09,151
Let's see
what we're dealing with.

523
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,661
Welcoming committee from Jaro.

524
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:20,662
We'll never outrun them in
this.

525
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:21,955
You're right.

526
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,332
We'll have to
even the match.

527
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:24,917
And how do you intend
to do that?

528
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,668
New playing field.

529
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,628
I'm taking us down
into the atmosphere.

530
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,797
They won't be able to use their
impulse engines down there.

531
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,758
If they want a fight

532
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,843
they'll have to fight
on our terms.

533
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,497
Come on.

534
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,125
Get down.

535
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:18,345
O'Brien to Sisko.

536
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:19,888
SISKO:<i> Go ahead.</i>

537
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,557
They've got us
pinned down in here.

538
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:24,143
<i>On our way, Chief.</i>

539
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:14,026
Now.

540
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,095
(<i> crying out</i> )

541
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,648
All right, they've
gone to thrusters.

542
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,483
That evens things
up a little.

543
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:57,736
If you consider
two against one even.

544
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:58,737
There is one problem.

545
00:28:58,778 --> 00:28:59,821
One?

546
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,031
The guys flying
those ships?

547
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,449
Yeah?

548
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:04,618
Used to be the guys
flying these ships.

549
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:06,912
Test the phaser banks.

550
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,455
Full power.
Good.

551
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:09,415
Uh, not so good.

552
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,374
Phaser locks are dead.

553
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:11,417
There's no way to aim.

554
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,210
Sure, there is!

555
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,546
I know. I know.
Seat of the pants.

556
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:17,214
With your eyes, Lieutenant,
not your pants.

557
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:18,340
Just point at them and fire!

558
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:20,676
You fly, I'll shoot.

559
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:22,344
Hang on.

560
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:50,414
Where the hell's
the other one?

561
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,627
I think we found him.

562
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:56,086
Thruster power's falling.

563
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:57,337
They must have hit
a plasma conduit.

564
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:58,338
Got any fire gear?

565
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,881
Check under the seat.

566
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,300
I think I got something.

567
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:02,842
Got it.

568
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:08,724
That's it?

569
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:10,559
That's it.

570
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:12,686
Might as well jettison
the plasma tank.

571
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:13,687
Thrusters are gone.

572
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:15,606
Plasma tank ejected.

573
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:18,734
Can you see any openings
where we can put down?

574
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:20,778
Six kilometers ahead
at 2 O'clock.

575
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,070
Uh, anything a little closer?

576
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:23,029
How much closer?

577
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,658
How about right here?

578
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,306
MAN:
Sir, up here.

579
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:51,725
One of the Ferengi's
holosuites is in use.

580
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,277
Don't try it.

581
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,696
Get their weapons.

582
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:20,379
SISKO:<i> This is</i>
<i>Commander Benjamin Sisko.</i>

583
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,048
<i>Please listen very carefully.</i>

584
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,592
<i>The Cardassians are supplying</i>
<i>the weapons for this coup.</i>

585
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:27,636
Ridiculous.

586
00:31:27,678 --> 00:31:29,596
No Bajoran would ever
accept help from them.

587
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:31,223
<i>Jaro doesn't know.</i>

588
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:33,684
<i>The Cardassians are using</i>
<i>the Kressari</i>

589
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:35,977
<i>to deliver the weapons</i>
<i>to the Circle.</i>

590
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,604
That is a Federation lie!

591
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:40,733
<i>The proof is on its way</i>
<i>to Bajor.</i>

592
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:44,361
<i>Once this evidence is</i>
<i>presented, the coup will end.</i>

593
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:47,947
<i>We don't want to fight you</i>
<i>or hurt anyone.</i>

594
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:51,451
<i>Your officers will be our</i>
<i>guests for a while.</i>

595
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:55,288
<i>I hope they won't mind</i>
<i>Starfleet combat rations.</i>

596
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:03,922
Day, what the hell
is going on?

597
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:06,091
I was taken prisoner.

598
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:08,719
The Federation
is behind all this.

599
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:10,596
Sisko spoke to me.

600
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,432
So, Commander,

601
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:16,852
you didn't abandon your post,
after all.

602
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:19,312
What did he say?

603
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,774
Nothing of consequence.

604
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:24,025
Why did he let you go?

605
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,319
I promised them amnesty--

606
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:29,072
a promise I have
no intention of keeping.

607
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,824
General, the security net
is back on line.

608
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:33,452
Scan for their
communication devices.

609
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:36,288
Not picking up a thing, sir.

610
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,748
Then they must be
in a shielded location.

611
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,458
The Cardassians used

612
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:42,085
duranium composite
to shield all the conduits.

613
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,922
Then that's where we'll
find Commander Sisko.

614
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,561
They found the raider,
and they're spreading out.

615
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:00,562
We can't stay here.

616
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:01,939
I'll slow you down.

617
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,149
The only thing
that's important now

618
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:07,152
is to get the evidence to
the provisional government.

619
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:08,904
It would be
a lot more convincing

620
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:10,280
if it comes from you.

621
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:13,158
No, the evidence
speaks for itself.

622
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:15,410
You have to leave me.

623
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:17,788
That's an order,
Lieutenant.

624
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:20,916
The Federation officially
left Bajor yesterday.

625
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:22,334
You're no longer
my commanding officer.

626
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,794
I can't walk.

627
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:25,128
Yes, you can.

628
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,046
You are being a fool, Dax.

629
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,632
Don't talk to
your elders that way.

630
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:30,175
MAN:
You two,
check over there.

631
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:35,263
MAN:
They couldn't have gotten far.

632
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:37,933
(<i> indistinct conversation</i>
<i>continues</i> )

633
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:45,983
(<i> groans</i> )

634
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:52,364
ODO:<i> Odo to Sisko.</i>

635
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,282
<i>I hope you're not</i>
<i>still on level five.</i>

636
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:56,034
No, we're on
three. Why?

637
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:58,036
<i>Because they're about to fill</i>
<i>the conduits</i>

638
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:00,747
<i>with anesthizine gas,</i>
<i>starting with level five.</i>

639
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:02,248
Chief?

640
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,959
Well, it's a good idea.

641
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:05,627
Kind of thing
I might have come up with.

642
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:09,255
We better get out of here,
and soon.

643
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:12,592
We should have heard something
from Kira and Dax by now.

644
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:14,553
Well, if they didn't make it

645
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,680
we're all fighting
for a lost cause here.

646
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:20,350
We still have
an ace in the hole.

647
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,520
Me?

648
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:26,815
Mr. O'Brien, get the units
ready to move out.

649
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:28,066
Aye, sir.

650
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:32,111
Jaro's plan depends
on the military's support.

651
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,531
Without it, the coup fails.

652
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,658
And you think
I can sway the generals.

653
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,451
Right now, there's
only one general

654
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:39,494
I'm concerned with--

655
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:41,580
the one that's here.

656
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:44,374
He's picked the wrong side
and we've got to convince him
of that.

657
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:49,337
Would you rather
follow a politician

658
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:52,049
or Bajor's greatest war hero?

659
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,843
I've done everything
I can to help.

660
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:57,136
I'd die for my people, but...

661
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,471
Sure, you would.

662
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:01,058
Dying gets you off the hook.

663
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,768
The question is,

664
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,228
are you willing to live
for your people--

665
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,522
live the role
they want you to play?

666
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:09,942
That's what they need
from you right now.

667
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:21,661
(<i> gasping and panting</i> )

668
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:23,496
Kira?

669
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,749
Kira, you're safe.

670
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:28,794
You're at the monastery.

671
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:32,380
I... the last thing
I remember...

672
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:34,674
The entire city
saw your ship go down.

673
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:37,803
The searchers who found you
are from my order.

674
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:38,887
Dax?

675
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:40,305
She's fine.

676
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:41,807
She's changing clothes.

677
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,851
We've got to get to
the Chamber of Ministers.

678
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,227
The Cardassians...

679
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,271
I know.
Lieutenant Dax told me.

680
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:49,522
Oh!

681
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,274
Careful.

682
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,569
Careful. You've just had
a broken hip mended.

683
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:57,948
How long have I been here?

684
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,825
Six hours.

685
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,118
Six hours?

686
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,411
We have to get out of here.

687
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:04,788
The Chamber of Minis...

688
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:05,872
Good, you're up.

689
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:06,832
Here, put this on.

690
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,083
Why are we...?

691
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,334
It's the only
way we can get

692
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,836
into the Chamber
of Ministers.

693
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:13,046
Members of religious orders
are the only ones

694
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:15,090
who can travel safely
in the streets.

695
00:36:15,132 --> 00:36:17,383
I'm going to escort you.

696
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,970
No. No, we have to go
alone, Bareil.

697
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:22,097
I can't be responsible
for your safety.

698
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:23,431
Of course you can't

699
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:25,809
but I can be
responsible for yours.

700
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:27,102
No...

701
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:29,395
Please, don't argue.

702
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,484
So, what do you think?

703
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:35,861
Think?

704
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,236
The nose.

705
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,280
Oh... it's flattering.

706
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,700
I'm thinking of keeping it.

707
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,202
Quark, leave it.

708
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:45,578
I can't leave it.

709
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,205
It's all that I am.

710
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,332
My personal mementos...

711
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:51,084
my family album...

712
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:53,670
It's full of gold-pressed
latinum and you know it.

713
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:56,131
Who told you?

714
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:58,466
Your mother did
the day you were born.

715
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:06,141
Never make fun of
a Ferengi's mother!

716
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:08,476
Rule of Acquisition,
Number 31.

717
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:10,395
SISKO:<i> Sisko to Bashir.</i>
<i>We're in position.</i>

718
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:12,438
We're stationed
above Airlock 14, sir,

719
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,314
awaiting your signal.

720
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,691
<i>You've got it.</i>

721
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:15,942
<i>Just make as much noise</i>
<i>as you can</i>

722
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:17,819
<i>before you surrender, Doctor.</i>

723
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:20,197
We'll make them think
there are 200 of us
instead of 20, sir.

724
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,823
Bashir out.

725
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:23,533
Twenty-one.

726
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:26,536
Come on.

727
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:28,413
Now!

728
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:32,959
Fine! Fine.

729
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:35,128
I'm coming.

730
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,685
Proceed with level three.

731
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:52,270
OFFICER:
General, the enemy

732
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:55,107
has attacked our position
at Airlock 14.

733
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:56,691
They have attacked?

734
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:59,027
We must have
flushed them out.

735
00:37:59,069 --> 00:38:00,237
Seal all airlocks.

736
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,487
Lock all docking clamps.

737
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:02,655
This is Colonel Day.

738
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,242
All security units
to Airlock 14.

739
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,119
Let me see what's
going on down there.

740
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,329
Surveillance cameras
have been sabotaged.

741
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:11,915
How many of our men
are stationed

742
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:14,000
by that airlock?
OFFICER: Four, sir.

743
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:16,002
OFFICER #2:
<i>Security to General Krim.</i>

744
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:18,713
<i>The enemy forces at</i>
<i>Airlock 14  have surrendered.</i>

745
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:21,258
<i>We've taken</i>
<i>several prisoners.</i>

746
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,426
Bring their leaders to me
for questioning.

747
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:24,928
<i>Aye, sir.</i>

748
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:41,402
O'BRIEN: Please don't
resist, General.

749
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,863
We don't wish
to use deadly force.

750
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:54,457
My name is Li Nalas.

751
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:56,584
Perhaps you've
heard of me.

752
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:06,719
Guards, stop that woman.

753
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,055
WINN: What is this blasphemy?

754
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:12,142
I am Major Kira Nerys,
and I come with proof

755
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:14,435
that the Cardassians
are behind Minister Jaro's

756
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,354
attempt to take control
of the government.

757
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:19,565
Major Kira has long been
an outspoken opponent

758
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,901
of the provisional government--
of reason, 

759
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:25,363
of progress,
and now, finally, of me.

760
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:27,699
I'm honored
to be included, Major.

761
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,952
But I have no intention
of allowing you to disrupt

762
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:35,165
the orderly transition of power
with these wild charges.

763
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:40,461
This is a manifest pad
from a Kressari vessel.

764
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:43,631
It bears the thumb scan
of a Cardassian gul

765
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:46,425
who transferred weapons
to that ship.

766
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:50,596
Those weapons were taken
by the Kressari to the Circle.

767
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:54,392
This coup will deliver Bajor

768
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:57,395
back into the hands
of its greatest enemies.

769
00:39:57,436 --> 00:40:00,357
Are you willing to live
under Cardassian rule again?

770
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,859
I assure you there's nothing
to these accusations.

771
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:06,112
Then you should have
no objection

772
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:08,948
to an inspection
of this manifest, Minister.

773
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,493
No, of course not.

774
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,871
We'll adjourn
for the time being.

775
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:23,296
And let me say
that I completely
support this investigation

776
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:25,464
and fully intend to cooperate.

777
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:31,054
(<i> crowd clamoring</i> )

778
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:52,409
KRIM:
Colonel, you deliberately
withheld information

779
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,994
that was to be
communicated to me.

780
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,289
Information?

781
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:59,707
Regarding the Cardassians.

782
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:03,711
Lies, that's all they were.

783
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:05,338
We have been told

784
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,673
the Chamber is in recess,
while evidence

785
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:11,386
of Cardassian involvement
is being examined.

786
00:41:11,428 --> 00:41:13,972
The Circle is
broken, Colonel.

787
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,517
I'm returning
to the surface immediately

788
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,937
to consult
with the Ministers.

789
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:24,607
I expect I will
be asked to resign.

790
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:32,282
Commander, since the
provisional
government has prevailed

791
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:34,409
I believe it is appropriate

792
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:37,578
to return the command
of this station to Starfleet.

793
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,541
Well-fought, sir.

794
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,134
No.

795
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:53,011
Commander!

796
00:41:57,349 --> 00:41:59,684
(<i> groaning</i> )

797
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:05,731
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

798
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:11,779
(<i> panting</i> )

799
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:13,114
(<i> chuckles</i> )

800
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:16,742
Off the hook... after all.

801
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:19,871
(<i> sighs deeply</i> )

802
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:22,040
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

803
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,422
(<i> steady tone sounds</i> )

804
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:44,812
Somehow, you figured,
now that he was here

805
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:46,772
things would be better.

806
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,649
You know, he'd...

807
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:52,820
he'd find a way
to make things better

808
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:56,366
because he was a man
who could do that.

809
00:42:56,408 --> 00:43:00,661
A great man.

810
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:03,956
I wish I knew
where we could find
others like him.

811
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:07,919
Major, there are heroes
all over Bajor.

812
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:13,132
I'm sitting with one.

813
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:16,928
I'm sorry.
I... don't feel
like celebrating tonight.

814
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,555
Excuse me.

815
00:43:25,395 --> 00:43:27,730
Sir, can I ask you something?

816
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:29,065
Sure.

817
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:30,066
About Li Nalas.

818
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,526
Mm-hmm.

819
00:43:31,568 --> 00:43:34,904
Well, listening to Kira
talk about all he was,

820
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:36,614
all he did,
all he was going to do,

821
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:39,617
she makes him sound like
he was larger than life

822
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:42,328
like he was some kind
of military genius.

823
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:44,872
But the Li Nalas
I fought with...

824
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:49,502
Chief, Li Nalas was<i> the hero</i>
of the Bajoran resistance.

825
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:52,297
He performed extraordinary
acts of courage for his people

826
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,466
and died for their freedom.

827
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:57,343
That's how the history books
on Bajor will be written,

828
00:43:57,385 --> 00:44:01,264
and that's how
I'll remember him
when anybody asks.

829
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:03,349
Yes, sir.

830
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:05,017
DAX:<i> Dax to Sisko.</i>

831
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:08,354
<i>The</i> Ganges<i> has just docked</i>
<i>at Pad C, Benjamin.</i>

832
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:09,606
Acknowledged.

833
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,483
Excuse me, sir.

834
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:24,120
Dad.
