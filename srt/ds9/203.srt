1
00:00:03,694 --> 00:00:05,162
Last time on <i>Deep Space Nine...</i>

2
00:00:05,196 --> 00:00:08,065
This is the emblem of
the Alliance for Global Unity.

3
00:00:08,101 --> 00:00:09,865
They call themselves the Circle.

4
00:00:09,905 --> 00:00:12,034
What gives them the right
to mess up our station?

5
00:00:12,076 --> 00:00:13,978
They're an extremist faction

6
00:00:14,012 --> 00:00:16,414
who believe in Bajor
for the Bajorans.

7
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,180
I can't loan you
a Starfleet runabout

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,486
without knowing
where you plan on taking it.

9
00:00:20,524 --> 00:00:21,856
To Cardassia IV

10
00:00:21,894 --> 00:00:24,262
to rescue
a Bajoran prisoner of war.

11
00:00:27,737 --> 00:00:30,765
Come on, we have a ship waiting.

12
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,905
What if I told you
that I knew someone

13
00:00:32,946 --> 00:00:35,007
who could bring stability
to Bajor?

14
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,384
Someone who could
unite the factions

15
00:00:37,421 --> 00:00:39,014
and give us a chance
to do our job.

16
00:00:39,057 --> 00:00:41,653
But Bajor doesn't need a man.

17
00:00:41,695 --> 00:00:43,824
It needs a symbol

18
00:00:43,866 --> 00:00:46,098
and that's what you are.

19
00:00:46,137 --> 00:00:49,507
Li Nalas needed to return here
to assume his new post.

20
00:00:49,543 --> 00:00:52,947
He's been made the Bajoran
Liaison Officer to Deep Space 9.

21
00:00:52,982 --> 00:00:55,612
I already have
a Liaison Officer.

22
00:00:55,654 --> 00:00:57,247
Not anymore, you don't.

23
00:00:57,357 --> 00:01:00,523
Major Kira is no longer
assigned to this post.

24
00:01:00,562 --> 00:01:02,532
She's been recalled to Bajor.

25
00:01:02,566 --> 00:01:04,900
It's over, everything.

26
00:01:04,937 --> 00:01:06,462
Bajor, the provisional
government

27
00:01:06,507 --> 00:01:08,339
the Federation being here...
all of it.

28
00:01:08,377 --> 00:01:09,777
We got to leave.

29
00:01:09,813 --> 00:01:12,443
The provisional government
will stand only if the military

30
00:01:12,484 --> 00:01:13,850
supports it.

31
00:01:13,887 --> 00:01:15,857
We are all patriots, Commander.

32
00:01:15,891 --> 00:01:17,223
I am the Circle, Major.

33
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,958
How can you
betray your own government?

34
00:01:26,943 --> 00:01:29,675
The Circle's being supplied
by the Cardassians.

35
00:01:29,716 --> 00:01:30,684
What?

36
00:01:30,718 --> 00:01:32,414
I... borrowed the proof.

37
00:01:32,454 --> 00:01:35,220
It's got a gul's thumb scan
on it.

38
00:01:35,258 --> 00:01:37,194
The Circle hates
the Cardassians.

39
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:39,461
They don't know
it is the Cardassians.

40
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,494
They think they've been buying
from Kressari traders.

41
00:01:42,538 --> 00:01:45,806
Think of the prestige of having
the new leader of Bajor

42
00:01:45,845 --> 00:01:47,643
being a member of your order.

43
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,281
If you are the new leader.

44
00:01:52,323 --> 00:01:54,555
Commander, two assault
vessels are headed this way

45
00:01:54,594 --> 00:01:56,564
on direct course from Bajor.

46
00:01:56,597 --> 00:01:59,466
They've given all non-Bajorans
seven hours to evacuate.

47
00:01:59,503 --> 00:02:02,201
And now, the conclusion.

48
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,913
Starfleet feels it has
no other choice.

49
00:02:06,948 --> 00:02:09,441
The Federation is here
at the invitation

50
00:02:09,487 --> 00:02:11,980
of the Bajoran
provisional government.

51
00:02:12,025 --> 00:02:15,019
No more provisional government,
no more invitation.

52
00:02:15,063 --> 00:02:18,263
Governments can break off
relations with an edict.

53
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,275
It's not so easy when it
comes down to our level, hmm?

54
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,608
Lieutenant Bilecki here

55
00:02:23,646 --> 00:02:27,210
is engaged to a young
man from Bajor.

56
00:02:27,252 --> 00:02:28,982
Ensign Kelly.

57
00:02:29,022 --> 00:02:30,285
Ensign Kelly's daughter

58
00:02:30,357 --> 00:02:31,985
worked together
with a young Bajoran girl

59
00:02:32,028 --> 00:02:34,828
on a prize-winning
science fair project.

60
00:02:34,866 --> 00:02:37,769
All of us who have served
on the station for the past year

61
00:02:37,804 --> 00:02:39,432
have made Bajoran friends.

62
00:02:39,473 --> 00:02:42,273
We've come to care about
what happens to these people.

63
00:02:42,313 --> 00:02:44,408
I know I do.

64
00:02:44,449 --> 00:02:46,612
So I've decided to stay.

65
00:02:48,089 --> 00:02:49,318
Just to make sure

66
00:02:49,358 --> 00:02:51,328
the evacuation
is conducted properly.

67
00:02:51,362 --> 00:02:53,058
You'll need someone

68
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:55,830
to oversee
the inventory process, sir.

69
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:58,637
Packing away
all my medical supplies

70
00:02:58,675 --> 00:03:00,702
could take, uh, quite
a while, Commander.

71
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:05,046
Before you volunteer too quickly

72
00:03:05,087 --> 00:03:07,580
understand
what you're getting into.

73
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,993
We'll be trying to delay
the takeover of the station

74
00:03:10,029 --> 00:03:10,997
as long as possible.

75
00:03:11,031 --> 00:03:12,693
Hopefully, as long as it takes

76
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,762
to expose the Cardassians'
involvement in all of this.

77
00:03:15,806 --> 00:03:18,709
It won't be easy.

78
00:03:18,745 --> 00:03:21,181
The Bajoran assault forces
have been told

79
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:24,016
that the Federation
is their blood enemy.

80
00:03:24,054 --> 00:03:28,961
Jaro and the Circle
would love nothing more

81
00:03:28,996 --> 00:03:31,831
than to have my head,
and yours

82
00:03:31,868 --> 00:03:34,839
and present them
to the Chamber of Ministers.

83
00:03:34,874 --> 00:03:38,836
This is your last chance
to leave here in one piece.

84
00:03:38,881 --> 00:03:42,320
Some of you have families.

85
00:03:42,354 --> 00:03:44,824
Some are
on temporary assignment.

86
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:46,121
I wouldn't blame anyone

87
00:03:46,161 --> 00:03:47,993
for getting out now
while you can.

88
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,728
I mean that.

89
00:03:52,238 --> 00:03:55,404
Anyone who wants to evacuate
is dismissed.

90
00:04:04,026 --> 00:04:06,588
Non-Bajorans won't be safe here.

91
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,692
Our families, children
have to be evacuated.

92
00:04:09,737 --> 00:04:12,207
I'm sure many of the Bajorans
who have worked with us

93
00:04:12,241 --> 00:04:13,675
will want to leave, too.

94
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:17,149
There is a lot to get done.

95
00:04:17,183 --> 00:04:20,883
The assault vessels will be here
in less than five hours.

96
00:04:20,923 --> 00:04:22,984
Dismissed.

97
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:50,098
Hundreds of people to evacuate

98
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,804
and only three tiny runabouts
available.

99
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:55,611
Do you know what that means?

100
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:58,052
Lt... it means...

101
00:06:58,088 --> 00:07:01,993
Well, a lot of people
will be left behind.

102
00:07:02,028 --> 00:07:03,998
Tragic. Yes, brother.

103
00:07:04,032 --> 00:07:06,662
Your compassion
never ceases to amaze me.

104
00:07:06,703 --> 00:07:09,333
It means we're going
to make a fortune.

105
00:07:09,374 --> 00:07:11,036
We are?

106
00:07:11,078 --> 00:07:15,142
People will pay anything
for a seat on those ships.

107
00:07:15,252 --> 00:07:16,345
You can't make me...

108
00:07:16,387 --> 00:07:19,153
Well, I won't sell my seat.

109
00:07:19,226 --> 00:07:20,251
Rom.

110
00:07:20,294 --> 00:07:24,256
No! I won't stay and be killed
just to fill your pockets.

111
00:07:24,301 --> 00:07:26,396
Rom, do you actually believe

112
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:30,242
that I would sacrifice
my own brother's life...

113
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,643
for personal profit?

114
00:07:39,796 --> 00:07:43,360
It would have to be
the deal of a lifetime.

115
00:07:43,402 --> 00:07:44,665
Yes, my lifetime.

116
00:07:44,704 --> 00:07:46,138
Listen to me.

117
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,202
We're both going to escape...

118
00:07:48,244 --> 00:07:50,476
but our bags will be filled

119
00:07:50,515 --> 00:07:54,045
with all the gold-pressed
latinum we can carry.

120
00:08:01,068 --> 00:08:02,036
Nog!

121
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:04,005
I've been looking
all over for you.

122
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,167
What ship you on?

123
00:08:05,242 --> 00:08:06,175
<i>Rio Grande.</i>

124
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,575
I'm on the <i>Ganges.</i>

125
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:09,013
Oh. Well, it'll be okay.

126
00:08:09,049 --> 00:08:11,542
We'll see each other
at the Hanolan colony

127
00:08:11,587 --> 00:08:12,782
in a few days.

128
00:08:12,822 --> 00:08:14,188
That's not where I'm going.

129
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,089
But my dad told me...

130
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:18,758
My ship's going
to the Korat system.

131
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,861
I guess that's
where they're taking

132
00:08:20,903 --> 00:08:22,565
all the Starfleet families.

133
00:08:22,607 --> 00:08:25,043
Well, this will be
over in no time.

134
00:08:25,078 --> 00:08:27,640
We'll be back in school
driving Mrs. O'Brien crazy

135
00:08:27,682 --> 00:08:28,877
in a few days.

136
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:31,320
Just when I think
I've found a new home

137
00:08:31,356 --> 00:08:32,346
and a new friend

138
00:08:32,391 --> 00:08:34,327
it always seems
like I got to leave.

139
00:08:34,361 --> 00:08:36,797
Hey, hu-man...

140
00:08:36,832 --> 00:08:38,232
Cut it out!

141
00:08:38,334 --> 00:08:40,896
Has there ever been
one of your kind

142
00:08:40,939 --> 00:08:43,876
and one of my kind
who were better friends?

143
00:08:43,911 --> 00:08:45,777
Never.

144
00:08:45,814 --> 00:08:49,583
And if our fathers
couldn't break us up

145
00:08:49,621 --> 00:08:51,591
no stupid coupe day... coupe...

146
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,116
Coup d'état.

147
00:08:53,161 --> 00:08:54,459
It's French.

148
00:08:54,497 --> 00:08:57,400
Well, no stupid French thing
will, either.

149
00:08:57,436 --> 00:09:00,032
We'll see each other again soon.

150
00:09:00,074 --> 00:09:01,542
That's a promise.

151
00:09:01,576 --> 00:09:02,839
Mr. Sisko, Nog

152
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:05,076
this is no time
to be fooling about.

153
00:09:05,116 --> 00:09:08,110
Get yourselves to wherever
you're supposed to be.

154
00:09:20,344 --> 00:09:22,108
Is that everything?

155
00:09:22,146 --> 00:09:23,774
Sure.

156
00:09:23,817 --> 00:09:26,344
Oh, Keiko, please.
Don't go like this.

157
00:09:26,388 --> 00:09:27,481
Like what?

158
00:09:27,523 --> 00:09:29,185
I don't have any choice.

159
00:09:29,226 --> 00:09:30,353
Don't you?

160
00:09:30,395 --> 00:09:31,454
He needs me.

161
00:09:31,497 --> 00:09:32,726
We don't?

162
00:09:32,766 --> 00:09:35,430
We can't just let the Cardies
have the wormhole.

163
00:09:35,471 --> 00:09:37,269
They could have
the whole Gamma Quadrant

164
00:09:37,341 --> 00:09:38,331
for all I care.

165
00:09:42,484 --> 00:09:43,782
Miles...

166
00:09:46,491 --> 00:09:48,289
come with us.

167
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,421
Where are we going?

168
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,160
On a ride, sweetheart.

169
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,193
Are you coming, too, Daddy?

170
00:09:54,238 --> 00:09:56,765
Soon, baby.

171
00:09:56,809 --> 00:09:59,439
I'll come as soon as I can.

172
00:10:05,892 --> 00:10:08,795
I'll walk you to the airlock.

173
00:10:16,912 --> 00:10:19,314
I've scanned every subspace
communication window

174
00:10:19,349 --> 00:10:20,942
to find a frequency to Bajor.

175
00:10:20,985 --> 00:10:22,681
They've got them
completely jammed.

176
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,919
Then we have no choice.

177
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,487
We'll have to take the proof
to the Chamber of Ministers.

178
00:10:27,531 --> 00:10:30,935
Jaro's forces will be scanning
for any incoming vessels.

179
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,031
A runabout could handle
a Bajoran patrol.

180
00:10:33,074 --> 00:10:35,306
Unfortunately,
I don't have one to give you.

181
00:10:35,345 --> 00:10:37,474
The Lunar V base?

182
00:10:37,516 --> 00:10:38,984
You think there's still
a ship there?

183
00:10:39,018 --> 00:10:39,986
We managed to get

184
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,081
a few subimpulse raiders
underground

185
00:10:42,123 --> 00:10:44,923
before the Cardassians hit us,
but that was ten years ago.

186
00:10:44,963 --> 00:10:46,522
Could one
of the evacuation vessels

187
00:10:46,565 --> 00:10:48,592
take a detour and drop me off?

188
00:10:48,635 --> 00:10:50,696
What if you get there
and those raiders won't fly?

189
00:10:50,739 --> 00:10:53,403
Then I'll have to wait
until I hear from you, I guess.

190
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:56,244
You may have to wait
a long time.

191
00:10:57,752 --> 00:10:59,118
Dax...

192
00:10:59,154 --> 00:11:02,422
do any of your former
hosts have experience

193
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:05,057
with subimpulse
thruster configurations?

194
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:06,590
Yes. Tobin Dax.

195
00:11:06,635 --> 00:11:09,367
Tobin? I don't think
I've heard about this one.

196
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,668
My second host.

197
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,974
Barely a sex life,
and no imagination

198
00:11:13,013 --> 00:11:16,213
but he knew phase coil inverters
like no one else.

199
00:11:16,252 --> 00:11:19,383
Major Kira could use
his experience today.

200
00:11:19,457 --> 00:11:20,755
I have no time
for this foolishness.

201
00:11:20,793 --> 00:11:21,761
I still have to pack.

202
00:11:21,795 --> 00:11:23,024
What's the problem?

203
00:11:23,064 --> 00:11:25,728
He's been brokering seats
on the evacuation vessels.

204
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:28,399
Where did you get more seats?

205
00:11:28,507 --> 00:11:30,409
Everybody always
asks the brokers

206
00:11:30,477 --> 00:11:32,845
where they get
their extra seats.

207
00:11:32,882 --> 00:11:34,544
And all I can say
is it's my business

208
00:11:34,585 --> 00:11:36,748
to find preferred seating
for a select list of clients...

209
00:11:36,789 --> 00:11:38,553
I have got more than 200 people

210
00:11:38,592 --> 00:11:40,424
who want to get
off this station.

211
00:11:40,495 --> 00:11:42,225
Where did you get more seats?!

212
00:11:42,265 --> 00:11:43,290
A few trades.

213
00:11:43,334 --> 00:11:45,132
A person here or there

214
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:47,573
who changed his mind
about leaving

215
00:11:47,609 --> 00:11:49,636
at the sight
of a reasonable stipend.

216
00:11:49,678 --> 00:11:51,408
Bashir to Commander Sisko.

217
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:52,678
Go ahead.

218
00:11:52,718 --> 00:11:55,086
We're having a bit of a panic
at the airlock, sir.

219
00:11:55,122 --> 00:11:57,592
Far more passengers
than we can handle have shown up

220
00:11:57,627 --> 00:12:01,259
and they all claim to have made
arrangements to leave.

221
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,998
I might have overbooked,
slightly.

222
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:07,937
On my way.

223
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:12,042
It's an accepted
Ferengi transit practice.

224
00:12:12,085 --> 00:12:14,681
I feel perfectly justified.

225
00:12:14,723 --> 00:12:16,750
I have complete faith

226
00:12:16,794 --> 00:12:19,128
in Commander Sisko's ability
to straighten this out.

227
00:12:19,165 --> 00:12:20,428
I'll pass that on.

228
00:12:20,534 --> 00:12:23,562
He'll be so pleased to know
that he has your confidence.

229
00:12:23,606 --> 00:12:25,131
As I'm no longer needed

230
00:12:25,176 --> 00:12:27,874
my brother is waiting for me
on the ship.

231
00:12:30,852 --> 00:12:32,582
Hey, Odo.

232
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:35,391
You'll miss me.

233
00:12:35,428 --> 00:12:36,657
You know you will.
Say it.

234
00:12:36,697 --> 00:12:38,997
I'll miss you, Quark.

235
00:12:39,034 --> 00:12:40,400
You said it!

236
00:12:40,437 --> 00:12:41,769
I'll miss the aggravation

237
00:12:41,806 --> 00:12:43,672
the petty theft,
the bad manners...

238
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:47,148
Odo... take care of yourself.

239
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,896
Don't you understand?!

240
00:12:58,937 --> 00:13:00,839
There isn't room for everyone.

241
00:13:00,873 --> 00:13:03,537
We have to get our families,
our children

242
00:13:03,578 --> 00:13:05,342
and non-Bajorans...

243
00:13:06,717 --> 00:13:09,347
Where are you running to?!

244
00:13:11,593 --> 00:13:13,186
This is Bajor.

245
00:13:14,865 --> 00:13:16,458
We are Bajorans.

246
00:13:17,604 --> 00:13:21,099
We fought a war
to regain our homeland.

247
00:13:21,143 --> 00:13:25,789
How can you abandon it
like frightened Cardassian vole?

248
00:13:25,922 --> 00:13:29,258
These ships are for our guests
who must leave

249
00:13:29,295 --> 00:13:32,357
because it is no longer safe
for them here.

250
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:37,467
However, we are Bajorans...

251
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:42,541
and I say that we stay
and we solve our own problems.

252
00:13:42,586 --> 00:13:44,282
Together.

253
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:47,851
Are you willing to join me?

254
00:13:55,743 --> 00:13:57,713
As soon as the passenger lists
are confirmed

255
00:13:57,747 --> 00:13:58,976
get these ships out of here.

256
00:13:59,015 --> 00:14:00,313
They're almost ready to go, sir.

257
00:14:00,351 --> 00:14:02,217
The <i>Rio Grande</i> is full
and so is the <i>Orinoco.</i>

258
00:14:02,254 --> 00:14:03,153
Get them launched.

259
00:14:03,256 --> 00:14:04,246
Aye, sir.

260
00:14:08,732 --> 00:14:10,030
Are you ready?

261
00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:11,560
I've been thinking.

262
00:14:11,605 --> 00:14:13,541
I really think
it'd be better if I stayed.

263
00:14:14,777 --> 00:14:17,543
Look, I just don't want
anything to happen to you.

264
00:14:17,582 --> 00:14:19,380
That makes two of us.

265
00:14:20,521 --> 00:14:21,648
What's this?

266
00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:23,089
A letter I wrote you.

267
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,286
A letter?

268
00:14:24,327 --> 00:14:25,693
Just some things.

269
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:28,200
I'll read it as soon
as I get on the ship.

270
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:29,531
Wait a while.

271
00:14:31,474 --> 00:14:34,468
I'll see you in
a couple of weeks.

272
00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:40,221
That's everyone, sir.

273
00:14:40,323 --> 00:14:42,225
Sisko to <i>Ganges.</i>

274
00:14:42,326 --> 00:14:44,090
Proceed with launch.

275
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,223
Acknowledged.

276
00:14:45,265 --> 00:14:47,428
Good luck, Commander.
Kira out.

277
00:14:47,468 --> 00:14:48,697
No! No!

278
00:14:48,737 --> 00:14:49,830
Wait!

279
00:14:51,677 --> 00:14:54,204
My ship... the <i>Rio Grande...</i>

280
00:14:54,248 --> 00:14:56,616
my brother's on it.

281
00:14:56,652 --> 00:14:58,245
He's got my ticket.

282
00:14:58,322 --> 00:14:59,381
That ship was full, sir.

283
00:14:59,424 --> 00:15:00,619
I checked the list myself.

284
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:01,854
Quark's name wasn't on it.

285
00:15:01,895 --> 00:15:03,193
His brother Rom did go aboard

286
00:15:03,264 --> 00:15:04,562
but he was with a dabo girl.

287
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,193
A dabo girl?

288
00:15:06,302 --> 00:15:07,861
What?

289
00:15:07,906 --> 00:15:10,741
Looks like he sold your seat.

290
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:16,446
No...

291
00:15:16,488 --> 00:15:17,956
No, you don't understand.

292
00:15:17,991 --> 00:15:21,327
You don't understand!

293
00:15:21,364 --> 00:15:23,357
I can't stay here!

294
00:15:25,437 --> 00:15:27,498
I'll be hung.

295
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,636
Call the ships back!

296
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,650
I'll pay anyone

297
00:15:32,684 --> 00:15:36,817
five bars of gold-pressed
latinum for a seat!

298
00:15:38,827 --> 00:15:40,159
Ten bars.

299
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:43,869
Twenty.

300
00:16:06,778 --> 00:16:08,576
Clear.

301
00:16:08,614 --> 00:16:10,173
No resistance at all.

302
00:16:10,218 --> 00:16:13,087
Minister Jaro's prediction
was correct.

303
00:16:13,123 --> 00:16:15,593
The Federation
has tucked its tail

304
00:16:15,627 --> 00:16:16,959
between its legs.

305
00:16:26,914 --> 00:16:30,478
Where are the Bajoran officers
who worked with Starfleet?

306
00:16:30,521 --> 00:16:33,185
Where is Li Nalas?

307
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:34,819
Perhaps they knew
this old station

308
00:16:34,862 --> 00:16:36,296
could never withstand a siege

309
00:16:36,331 --> 00:16:38,494
and they abandoned it
with Starfleet.

310
00:16:38,535 --> 00:16:43,602
The most strategic position
in the entire sector...

311
00:16:43,644 --> 00:16:47,242
at the mouth of the wormhole.

312
00:16:47,284 --> 00:16:49,413
Hmm.

313
00:16:49,455 --> 00:16:51,857
Had I been Federation Commander

314
00:16:51,893 --> 00:16:54,955
I would not have abandoned it
so easily.

315
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:16,291
Can you believe, a year ago, I
was living in a camp like this?

316
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:18,738
Only not quite so nice.

317
00:17:18,774 --> 00:17:22,042
Have I mentioned how allergic
Trills are to insect bites?

318
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,446
Really?

319
00:17:23,483 --> 00:17:25,510
Well, the biochemical
connections

320
00:17:25,553 --> 00:17:28,787
between host and symbiont
can't tolerate the... oh!

321
00:17:28,825 --> 00:17:29,793
Whoa! What's that?

322
00:17:29,827 --> 00:17:30,954
Is that a spider or a dog?

323
00:17:30,996 --> 00:17:32,692
<i>Palukoo.</i>

324
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:35,033
The Bajoran moons
are full of them.

325
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:38,064
Oh, I suppose you used
to make them your pets

326
00:17:38,109 --> 00:17:40,773
and, uh, sing songs about them
around the campfire.

327
00:17:40,814 --> 00:17:42,784
No. We used to eat them.

328
00:17:42,818 --> 00:17:44,150
There it is.

329
00:17:49,263 --> 00:17:51,199
Are you sure this thing
is supposed to fly?

330
00:17:51,232 --> 00:17:53,098
Oh, I've been in a lot worse.

331
00:18:00,081 --> 00:18:01,379
I guess the Bajoran resistance

332
00:18:01,484 --> 00:18:03,146
must have had
a lot of short pilots.

333
00:18:03,188 --> 00:18:04,816
Ha, no, just short engineers.

334
00:18:04,857 --> 00:18:07,692
They were always
building these things

335
00:18:07,728 --> 00:18:08,821
without thinking.

336
00:18:08,864 --> 00:18:09,889
Encouraging.

337
00:18:09,933 --> 00:18:11,731
Just bend your knees.
You'll fit.

338
00:18:17,881 --> 00:18:20,818
Now, the real trick will be
to fire up these thrusters

339
00:18:20,852 --> 00:18:21,820
after all this time.

340
00:18:21,854 --> 00:18:23,345
It was hard enough
to get them going

341
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,881
when they were being used
every day.

342
00:18:24,926 --> 00:18:26,326
We'll get them fired up.

343
00:18:26,362 --> 00:18:28,355
You don't have
to worry about that.

344
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,699
Oh, you're sure, huh?

345
00:18:30,737 --> 00:18:32,365
Yep.

346
00:18:32,406 --> 00:18:35,742
I have no intention
of getting stuck here

347
00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:37,645
eating <i>palukoos.</i>

348
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,196
We should inform Minister Jaro
of our success immediately.

349
00:18:50,238 --> 00:18:52,800
You're too eager to receive
his plaudits, Colonel.

350
00:18:52,844 --> 00:18:54,377
What's the status
of the internal security net?

351
00:18:54,377 --> 00:18:55,276
What's the status
of the internal security net?

352
00:18:55,312 --> 00:18:57,544
Completely disabled, General.

353
00:18:57,582 --> 00:18:59,745
Scan the Operations Center
for organic material.

354
00:18:59,786 --> 00:19:01,186
Organic?

355
00:19:01,222 --> 00:19:04,558
The station's Security Chief
is apparently missing.

356
00:19:06,732 --> 00:19:08,998
The shape-shifter.

357
00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:12,873
It's possible he left
with the evacuation ships

358
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:15,608
or perhaps there's
something more here

359
00:19:15,648 --> 00:19:17,378
than meets the eye.

360
00:19:17,418 --> 00:19:19,250
Yes, sir.

361
00:19:19,288 --> 00:19:23,250
Scan six times an hour
at random intervals.

362
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,959
Minister Jaro on subspace, sir.

363
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,400
Minister, I'm pleased
to inform you

364
00:19:27,436 --> 00:19:29,906
that we've encountered
no resistance so far.

365
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,467
Good news. Then
the Federation has withdrawn.

366
00:19:32,511 --> 00:19:33,809
We monitored the evacuation

367
00:19:33,847 --> 00:19:35,908
of three vessels
several hours ago.

368
00:19:35,951 --> 00:19:38,387
When I announce that we've
secured the station

369
00:19:38,422 --> 00:19:39,617
it will certainly impact...

370
00:19:39,658 --> 00:19:41,651
Minister, I urge caution.

371
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:45,657
The battle for this station
hasn't even begun yet.

372
00:19:45,702 --> 00:19:48,036
Do you expect the enemy
to return, General?

373
00:19:48,073 --> 00:19:50,043
I'm not convinced
they ever left.

374
00:19:50,076 --> 00:19:52,672
The internal security net
has been sabotaged.

375
00:19:52,714 --> 00:19:57,621
We have no way of tracking the
movements of anyone on board

376
00:19:57,656 --> 00:20:00,126
which suggests
someone didn't want

377
00:20:00,161 --> 00:20:01,959
to be that easily found.

378
00:20:01,998 --> 00:20:03,991
Kira?

379
00:20:04,034 --> 00:20:06,504
Perhaps.
She is unaccounted for.

380
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,975
So, too, is Security Chief Odo.

381
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,478
So is Li Nalas.

382
00:20:10,514 --> 00:20:11,482
You're right.

383
00:20:11,515 --> 00:20:14,315
Li Nalas would have never
abandoned Bajor.

384
00:20:14,354 --> 00:20:15,788
He must still be there.

385
00:20:15,823 --> 00:20:18,419
Let me reemphasize that you are
to take every necessary step

386
00:20:18,461 --> 00:20:19,986
to keep Li Nalas alive.

387
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,055
Dead, he's a martyr.

388
00:20:21,099 --> 00:20:22,795
Alive, he seals our victory.

389
00:20:22,835 --> 00:20:25,101
Understood.

390
00:20:25,139 --> 00:20:27,268
Once you have him

391
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:30,406
Li will see the wisdom
of giving you his support.

392
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:32,920
I'll offer him anything he wants
to make sure he does...

393
00:20:32,954 --> 00:20:35,618
short of becoming
the next Kai, of course.

394
00:20:40,835 --> 00:20:44,797
You have a unique ability
to build a consensus, Essa.

395
00:20:44,842 --> 00:20:48,212
Bajor has been waiting
for a leader like you.

396
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:50,181
Leaders like us.

397
00:20:52,188 --> 00:20:56,127
If I am so favored
by the Vedek Assembly.

398
00:20:56,162 --> 00:20:58,928
You don't have
to worry about that.

399
00:21:02,673 --> 00:21:05,941
26 hours after I'm
sworn into office

400
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:10,614
I'll direct the Vedek Assembly
to elect you Kai.

401
00:21:10,655 --> 00:21:13,057
Together, we will rebuild Bajor.

402
00:21:23,745 --> 00:21:25,145
You got it!

403
00:21:26,516 --> 00:21:28,144
Don't turn the engines off.

404
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:30,213
We'll never get them
started again.

405
00:21:30,323 --> 00:21:31,985
Let's go.

406
00:21:32,027 --> 00:21:34,395
Thank you, Tobin.

407
00:21:34,431 --> 00:21:35,922
Dax, come on.

408
00:21:37,036 --> 00:21:38,004
Oh, the hell with it.

409
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:39,472
If it's going to fly,
it's going to fly.

410
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:40,907
Problem?

411
00:21:40,943 --> 00:21:42,468
No, everything's wonderful.

412
00:21:42,512 --> 00:21:44,071
Ow!

413
00:21:44,114 --> 00:21:45,480
The knees.

414
00:21:45,518 --> 00:21:47,488
Oh, listen to that sound.

415
00:21:47,521 --> 00:21:50,356
That sure brings back
some memories.

416
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,658
How did you win a war
in these things?

417
00:21:52,697 --> 00:21:54,222
We were the insects, Lieutenant.

418
00:21:54,267 --> 00:21:55,895
The Cardassians were
just as allergic as Trills.

419
00:21:55,936 --> 00:21:57,063
Is the proximity system working?

420
00:21:58,574 --> 00:22:00,737
I think so.

421
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:02,771
All right, let's see
if we can get out of here

422
00:22:02,815 --> 00:22:04,249
without bouncing off any walls.

423
00:22:06,488 --> 00:22:08,617
You're playing
right into their hands.

424
00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:11,721
If you're so convinced
they're still here

425
00:22:11,765 --> 00:22:15,135
how can you sit
and wait for them to attack?

426
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:18,039
They have no interest
in attacking.

427
00:22:18,076 --> 00:22:20,137
What makes you so sure?

428
00:22:20,179 --> 00:22:23,583
Because I understand
military tactics.

429
00:22:23,619 --> 00:22:26,819
They are vastly outnumbered.

430
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:28,852
If we divide our forces...

431
00:22:30,532 --> 00:22:32,832
The primary sensor array
was sabotaged, sir.

432
00:22:32,869 --> 00:22:36,603
As soon as we tested it,
the sub-net shorted out.

433
00:22:37,844 --> 00:22:41,613
You can let your engineers
play with the machines.

434
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,645
I'm sending out search parties.

435
00:22:46,995 --> 00:22:48,623
Eat hearty.

436
00:22:48,664 --> 00:22:50,861
The replicators crash
in 16 minutes.

437
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:53,464
This will have to last a while.

438
00:22:53,506 --> 00:22:54,565
Combat rations, Chief?

439
00:22:54,608 --> 00:22:57,010
Couldn't you have
replicated something

440
00:22:57,046 --> 00:22:58,480
a little more palatable?

441
00:22:58,515 --> 00:23:00,074
You don't like combat rations?

442
00:23:00,118 --> 00:23:03,089
A French onion soup
would have really been nice.

443
00:23:03,124 --> 00:23:05,617
Miracle of science,
these little combat rations.

444
00:23:05,662 --> 00:23:08,224
Timed-release formula
of all the nutrients

445
00:23:08,266 --> 00:23:10,532
the body needs for three days.

446
00:23:10,571 --> 00:23:11,834
I love them.

447
00:23:11,873 --> 00:23:13,968
The only thing I miss
about the Cardassian front.

448
00:23:15,412 --> 00:23:16,505
Sisko to all units.

449
00:23:16,547 --> 00:23:20,281
You can thank Chief
of Operations Miles O'Brien

450
00:23:20,387 --> 00:23:22,448
for your repast this afternoon.

451
00:23:22,492 --> 00:23:24,928
Oh, you haven't made
any friends here, Chief.

452
00:23:24,963 --> 00:23:26,727
Or should I say chef?

453
00:23:26,767 --> 00:23:28,395
Julian!

454
00:23:28,436 --> 00:23:31,100
Well, I would have expected you
of all people

455
00:23:31,141 --> 00:23:34,044
to appreciate the nutritional
value of combat rations.

456
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,513
Actually, when I was
in med school

457
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:36,983
I designed
an incredible candy bar

458
00:23:37,018 --> 00:23:39,318
which was far superior
in food value.

459
00:23:39,356 --> 00:23:42,487
Am I the only one that doesn't
think this is funny?

460
00:23:42,528 --> 00:23:43,826
Odo to Sisko.

461
00:23:43,863 --> 00:23:45,161
Go ahead.

462
00:23:45,199 --> 00:23:46,565
Standby.
There's a patrol approaching.

463
00:23:46,601 --> 00:23:48,399
I'll get back to you
in a minute.

464
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:03,193
A five-man unit

465
00:24:03,232 --> 00:24:05,998
is about to begin
a search of the cargo deck.

466
00:24:06,037 --> 00:24:07,869
That puts them closest to me,
Commander.

467
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:08,999
Stand by, Doctor.

468
00:24:09,042 --> 00:24:12,776
Maybe we should send someone
with a little more experience.

469
00:24:12,815 --> 00:24:15,411
Someone who can run the show,
like Li.

470
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:18,151
No, I need him here with us.

471
00:24:18,192 --> 00:24:23,065
Doctor, move your unit
to Cargo Bay 6.

472
00:24:23,101 --> 00:24:24,501
You know what to do.

473
00:24:24,537 --> 00:24:26,335
And let me reemphasize...

474
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,941
use deadly force
only if absolutely necessary.

475
00:24:29,074 --> 00:24:30,235
Aye, sir.

476
00:24:30,276 --> 00:24:31,369
We're on our way.

477
00:24:31,412 --> 00:24:32,744
Happy hunting.

478
00:24:50,212 --> 00:24:52,774
I wouldn't get
too close to that.

479
00:24:52,817 --> 00:24:54,719
It's thorium isotope.

480
00:24:58,461 --> 00:25:03,198
Prolonged exposure could have
very nasty consequences.

481
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,539
Bashir to Sisko.

482
00:25:08,579 --> 00:25:09,706
Go ahead.

483
00:25:09,748 --> 00:25:11,182
Mission accomplished.

484
00:25:11,217 --> 00:25:15,020
We have our first five
prisoners of war.

485
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:27,937
Preparing to establish
a high-altitude orbit of Bajor.

486
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,473
Navigational sensors
aren't functioning.

487
00:25:30,518 --> 00:25:31,486
No problem.

488
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,510
No problem?

489
00:25:32,555 --> 00:25:33,523
Big problem.

490
00:25:33,557 --> 00:25:34,855
Without navigational sensors...

491
00:25:34,893 --> 00:25:36,863
We'll have to fly
by the seat of our pants.

492
00:25:36,897 --> 00:25:39,629
Great.
Seat-of-the-pants technology.

493
00:25:39,668 --> 00:25:42,730
You Starfleet types are too
dependent on gadgets and gizmos.

494
00:25:42,773 --> 00:25:45,608
You lose your natural instincts
for survival.

495
00:25:45,646 --> 00:25:47,444
My natural instincts
for survival told me

496
00:25:47,482 --> 00:25:48,814
not to climb aboard this thing.

497
00:25:48,851 --> 00:25:50,717
I'd say they were
functioning pretty well.

498
00:25:50,755 --> 00:25:52,314
I know the terrain of Bajor.

499
00:25:52,358 --> 00:25:55,295
We ought to be able to
recognize a landing site...

500
00:25:56,431 --> 00:25:57,421
What the hell was that?

501
00:25:57,467 --> 00:25:58,435
I have no idea.

502
00:25:58,469 --> 00:26:00,371
None of the sensors
are functioning.

503
00:26:00,405 --> 00:26:03,376
Someone's firing at us.

504
00:26:03,411 --> 00:26:05,347
Initiating evasive maneuvers.

505
00:26:05,381 --> 00:26:08,045
I'm reading the EM signature
of an impulse engine.

506
00:26:08,085 --> 00:26:10,351
Let's see
what we're dealing with.

507
00:26:18,938 --> 00:26:20,874
Welcoming committee from Jaro.

508
00:26:20,976 --> 00:26:22,103
We'll never outrun them in this.

509
00:26:22,145 --> 00:26:23,113
You're right.

510
00:26:23,147 --> 00:26:24,445
We'll have to even the match.

511
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:25,973
And how do you intend
to do that?

512
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:27,316
New playing field.

513
00:26:27,354 --> 00:26:29,118
I'm taking us down
into the atmosphere.

514
00:26:29,157 --> 00:26:31,889
They won't be able to use their
impulse engines down there.

515
00:26:31,996 --> 00:26:33,828
If they want a fight

516
00:26:33,865 --> 00:26:36,131
they'll have to fight
on our terms.

517
00:27:02,851 --> 00:27:03,910
Come on.

518
00:27:04,921 --> 00:27:06,219
Get down.

519
00:27:18,479 --> 00:27:19,572
O'Brien to Sisko.

520
00:27:19,615 --> 00:27:20,844
Go ahead.

521
00:27:20,884 --> 00:27:22,580
They've got us
pinned down in here.

522
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,352
On our way, Chief.

523
00:28:13,311 --> 00:28:15,041
Now.

524
00:28:50,644 --> 00:28:53,137
All right,
they've gone to thrusters.

525
00:28:53,182 --> 00:28:55,516
That evens things up a little.

526
00:28:55,553 --> 00:28:58,581
If you consider
two against one even.

527
00:28:58,626 --> 00:28:59,685
There is one problem.

528
00:28:59,728 --> 00:29:00,787
One?

529
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,298
The guys flying those ships?

530
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:03,426
Yeah?

531
00:29:03,468 --> 00:29:05,438
Used to be the guys
flying these ships.

532
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,969
Test the phaser banks.

533
00:29:08,042 --> 00:29:09,408
- Full power.
- Good.

534
00:29:09,445 --> 00:29:10,413
Uh, not so good.

535
00:29:10,447 --> 00:29:11,472
Phaser locks are dead.

536
00:29:11,515 --> 00:29:12,574
There's no way to aim.

537
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:13,585
Sure, there is!

538
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:14,917
I know. I know.

539
00:29:14,955 --> 00:29:16,583
Seat of the pants.

540
00:29:16,624 --> 00:29:18,252
With your eyes, Lieutenant,
not your pants.

541
00:29:18,295 --> 00:29:19,388
Just point at them and fire!

542
00:29:19,429 --> 00:29:21,797
You fly, I'll shoot.

543
00:29:21,834 --> 00:29:23,132
Hang on.

544
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:51,582
Where the hell's the other one?

545
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:55,583
I think we found him.

546
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:56,721
Thruster power's falling.

547
00:29:56,763 --> 00:29:58,391
They must have hit
a plasma conduit.

548
00:29:58,434 --> 00:29:59,402
Got any fire gear?

549
00:29:59,435 --> 00:30:00,994
Check under the seat.

550
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:02,404
I think I got something.

551
00:30:02,441 --> 00:30:03,602
Got it.

552
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:09,946
That's it?

553
00:30:09,987 --> 00:30:11,580
That's it.

554
00:30:11,623 --> 00:30:13,650
Might as well jettison
the plasma tank.

555
00:30:13,694 --> 00:30:14,889
Thrusters are gone.

556
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,592
Plasma tank ejected.

557
00:30:16,632 --> 00:30:19,728
Can you see any openings
where we can put down?

558
00:30:19,772 --> 00:30:21,742
Six kilometers ahead at 2:00.

559
00:30:21,775 --> 00:30:22,970
Uh, anything a little closer?

560
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:23,978
How much closer?

561
00:30:24,012 --> 00:30:26,505
How about right here?

562
00:30:47,484 --> 00:30:49,613
Sir, up here.

563
00:30:49,721 --> 00:30:52,317
One of the Ferengi's
holosuites is in use.

564
00:31:00,707 --> 00:31:02,700
Don't try it.

565
00:31:02,744 --> 00:31:04,076
Get their weapons.

566
00:31:18,138 --> 00:31:20,836
This is
Commander Benjamin Sisko.

567
00:31:20,876 --> 00:31:22,708
Please listen very carefully.

568
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:26,208
The Cardassians are supplying
the weapons for this coup.

569
00:31:26,254 --> 00:31:27,483
Ridiculous.

570
00:31:27,522 --> 00:31:30,118
No Bajoran would ever
accept help from them.

571
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,628
Jaro doesn't know.

572
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:34,257
The Cardassians are using
the Kressari

573
00:31:34,301 --> 00:31:36,533
to deliver the weapons
to the Circle.

574
00:31:36,572 --> 00:31:38,165
That is a Federation lie!

575
00:31:38,208 --> 00:31:41,476
The proof is on its way
to Bajor.

576
00:31:41,514 --> 00:31:44,816
Once this evidence is presented,
the coup will end.

577
00:31:44,854 --> 00:31:48,486
We don't want to fight you
or hurt anyone.

578
00:31:48,527 --> 00:31:52,125
Your officers will be our guests
for a while.

579
00:31:52,167 --> 00:31:55,970
I hope they won't mind
Starfleet combat rations.

580
00:32:00,983 --> 00:32:04,444
Day, what the hell
is going on?

581
00:32:04,488 --> 00:32:06,617
I was taken prisoner.

582
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:09,129
The Federation
is behind all this.

583
00:32:09,164 --> 00:32:10,325
Sisko spoke to me.

584
00:32:12,069 --> 00:32:13,765
So, Commander

585
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:17,404
you didn't abandon your post,
after all.

586
00:32:17,446 --> 00:32:19,609
What did he say?

587
00:32:19,649 --> 00:32:21,915
Nothing of consequence.

588
00:32:21,953 --> 00:32:24,355
Why did he let you go?

589
00:32:24,391 --> 00:32:26,827
I promised them amnesty...

590
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:29,424
a promise I have
no intention of keeping.

591
00:32:29,467 --> 00:32:31,299
General, the security net
is back on line.

592
00:32:31,337 --> 00:32:33,933
Scan for their
communication devices.

593
00:32:33,975 --> 00:32:36,605
Not picking up a thing, sir.

594
00:32:36,646 --> 00:32:38,342
Then they must be
in a shielded location.

595
00:32:38,383 --> 00:32:39,681
The Cardassians used

596
00:32:39,786 --> 00:32:42,348
duranium composite
to shield all the conduits.

597
00:32:42,391 --> 00:32:45,453
Then that's where we'll
find Commander Sisko.

598
00:32:58,252 --> 00:33:00,118
They found the raider,
and they're spreading out.

599
00:33:00,156 --> 00:33:01,124
We can't stay here.

600
00:33:01,158 --> 00:33:02,524
I'll slow you down.

601
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,553
The only thing
that's important now

602
00:33:04,596 --> 00:33:07,658
is to get the evidence
to the provisional government.

603
00:33:07,769 --> 00:33:09,499
It would be
a lot more convincing

604
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:10,666
if it comes from you.

605
00:33:10,741 --> 00:33:13,678
No, the evidence
speaks for itself.

606
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,046
You have to leave me.

607
00:33:16,084 --> 00:33:18,247
That's an order, Lieutenant.

608
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:21,384
The Federation officially
left Bajor yesterday.

609
00:33:21,427 --> 00:33:22,918
You're no longer
my commanding officer.

610
00:33:22,963 --> 00:33:24,226
I can't walk.

611
00:33:24,265 --> 00:33:25,528
Yes, you can.

612
00:33:25,568 --> 00:33:27,504
You are being a fool, Dax.

613
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:29,166
Don't talk to your elders
that way.

614
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:30,699
You two, check over there.

615
00:33:33,616 --> 00:33:35,813
They couldn't have gotten far.

616
00:33:51,448 --> 00:33:53,110
Odo to Sisko.

617
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:54,982
I hope you're not
still on level five.

618
00:33:55,021 --> 00:33:56,580
No, we're on three.
Why?

619
00:33:56,624 --> 00:33:58,617
Because they're about to fill
the conduits

620
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:01,257
with anesthizine gas,
starting with level five.

621
00:34:01,299 --> 00:34:02,790
Chief?

622
00:34:02,835 --> 00:34:04,360
Well, it's a good idea.

623
00:34:04,404 --> 00:34:07,239
Kind of thing
I might have come up with.

624
00:34:07,277 --> 00:34:10,477
We better get out of here,
and soon.

625
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:13,851
We should have heard something
from Kira and Dax by now.

626
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,481
Well, if they didn't make it

627
00:34:15,524 --> 00:34:18,427
we're all fighting
for a lost cause here.

628
00:34:18,462 --> 00:34:20,830
We still have
an ace in the hole.

629
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:24,135
Me?

630
00:34:24,173 --> 00:34:27,235
Mr. O'Brien, get the units
ready to move out.

631
00:34:27,279 --> 00:34:28,611
Aye, sir.

632
00:34:30,217 --> 00:34:32,710
Jaro's plan depends
on the military's support.

633
00:34:32,755 --> 00:34:34,884
Without it, the coup fails.

634
00:34:34,926 --> 00:34:37,260
And you think
I can sway the generals.

635
00:34:37,297 --> 00:34:39,027
Right now,
there's only one general

636
00:34:39,067 --> 00:34:41,196
I'm concerned with...
the one that's here.

637
00:34:41,237 --> 00:34:42,637
He's picked the wrong side

638
00:34:42,673 --> 00:34:44,700
and we've got to convince him
of that.

639
00:34:46,747 --> 00:34:49,947
Would you rather
follow a politician

640
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:52,583
or Bajor's greatest war hero?

641
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:55,357
I've done everything
I can to help.

642
00:34:55,396 --> 00:34:57,730
I'd die for my people, but...

643
00:34:57,767 --> 00:34:59,030
Sure, you would.

644
00:34:59,069 --> 00:35:01,539
Dying gets you off the hook.

645
00:35:01,574 --> 00:35:02,667
The question is

646
00:35:02,709 --> 00:35:05,737
are you willing to live
for your people...

647
00:35:05,781 --> 00:35:07,910
live the role
they want you to play?

648
00:35:07,952 --> 00:35:10,479
That's what they need
from you right now.

649
00:35:22,177 --> 00:35:24,043
Kira?

650
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:25,379
Kira, you're safe.

651
00:35:25,417 --> 00:35:27,785
You're at the monastery.

652
00:35:27,888 --> 00:35:32,727
I... the last thing
I remember...

653
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:34,960
The entire city
saw your ship go down.

654
00:35:35,001 --> 00:35:38,235
The searchers who found you
are from my order.

655
00:35:38,273 --> 00:35:39,332
Dax?

656
00:35:39,375 --> 00:35:40,809
She's fine.

657
00:35:40,911 --> 00:35:42,174
She's changing clothes.

658
00:35:42,213 --> 00:35:45,309
We've got to get
to the Chamber of Ministers.

659
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:46,820
The Cardassians...

660
00:35:46,855 --> 00:35:48,825
I know.
Lieutenant Dax told me.

661
00:35:48,859 --> 00:35:50,020
Oh!

662
00:35:50,061 --> 00:35:51,654
Careful.

663
00:35:51,697 --> 00:35:55,830
Careful. You've just had
a broken hip mended.

664
00:35:55,871 --> 00:35:58,364
How long have I been here?

665
00:35:58,409 --> 00:36:01,609
- Six hours.
- Six hours.

666
00:36:01,648 --> 00:36:03,948
We have to get out of here.

667
00:36:03,986 --> 00:36:05,284
The Chamber of Minis...

668
00:36:05,322 --> 00:36:06,381
Good, you're up.

669
00:36:06,424 --> 00:36:07,517
Here, put this on.

670
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:08,618
Why are we?

671
00:36:08,661 --> 00:36:10,961
It's the only way we can get
into the Chamber of Ministers.

672
00:36:10,998 --> 00:36:13,560
Members of religious orders
are the only ones

673
00:36:13,603 --> 00:36:15,732
who can travel safely
in the streets.

674
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:17,801
I'm going to escort you.

675
00:36:17,878 --> 00:36:20,508
No. No, we have to go
alone, Bareil.

676
00:36:20,549 --> 00:36:22,746
I can't be responsible
for your safety.

677
00:36:22,787 --> 00:36:24,016
Of course, you can't

678
00:36:24,055 --> 00:36:26,321
but I can be
responsible for yours.

679
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,589
No...

680
00:36:27,629 --> 00:36:30,122
Please, don't argue.

681
00:36:33,372 --> 00:36:35,034
So, what do you think?

682
00:36:35,075 --> 00:36:36,338
Think?

683
00:36:36,378 --> 00:36:37,710
The nose.

684
00:36:37,747 --> 00:36:39,717
Oh... it's flattering.

685
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:42,220
I'm thinking of keeping it.

686
00:36:42,254 --> 00:36:44,389
Quark, leave it.

687
00:36:44,522 --> 00:36:45,888
I can't leave it.

688
00:36:45,924 --> 00:36:47,552
It's all that I am.

689
00:36:47,595 --> 00:36:49,656
My personal mementos...

690
00:36:49,698 --> 00:36:51,326
my family album...

691
00:36:51,368 --> 00:36:53,930
It's full of gold-pressed
latinum and you know it.

692
00:36:53,973 --> 00:36:56,375
Who told you?

693
00:36:56,411 --> 00:36:58,608
Your mother did
the day you were born.

694
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:06,526
Never make fun
of a Ferengi's mother!

695
00:37:06,562 --> 00:37:08,691
Rule of Acquisition, Number 31.

696
00:37:08,733 --> 00:37:10,703
Sisko to Bashir.
We're in position.

697
00:37:10,736 --> 00:37:12,672
We're stationed
above Airlock 14, sir

698
00:37:12,707 --> 00:37:13,675
awaiting your signal.

699
00:37:13,709 --> 00:37:14,677
You've got it.

700
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,837
Just make as much noise
as you can

701
00:37:15,878 --> 00:37:17,848
before you surrender, Doctor.

702
00:37:17,882 --> 00:37:20,216
We'll make them think
there are 200 of us

703
00:37:20,253 --> 00:37:21,551
instead of 20, sir.

704
00:37:21,589 --> 00:37:22,716
Bashir out.

705
00:37:22,758 --> 00:37:23,919
Twenty-one.

706
00:37:25,763 --> 00:37:26,788
Come on.

707
00:37:26,832 --> 00:37:28,630
Now!

708
00:37:30,472 --> 00:37:33,375
Fine! Fine.

709
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:35,403
I'm coming.

710
00:37:48,905 --> 00:37:50,932
Proceed with level three.

711
00:37:50,975 --> 00:37:52,443
General, the enemy

712
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:55,278
has attacked our position
at Airlock 14.

713
00:37:55,316 --> 00:37:56,978
They have attacked?

714
00:37:57,019 --> 00:37:59,216
We must have flushed them out.

715
00:37:59,257 --> 00:38:00,384
Seal all airlocks.

716
00:38:00,426 --> 00:38:02,292
Lock all docking clamps.

717
00:38:02,328 --> 00:38:03,557
This is Colonel Day.

718
00:38:03,631 --> 00:38:06,033
All security units
to Airlock 14.

719
00:38:06,068 --> 00:38:08,470
Let me see
what's going on down there.

720
00:38:08,506 --> 00:38:10,099
Surveillance cameras
have been sabotaged.

721
00:38:10,143 --> 00:38:13,411
How many of our men are
stationed by that airlock?

722
00:38:13,449 --> 00:38:14,474
Four, sir.

723
00:38:14,517 --> 00:38:15,678
Security to General Krim.

724
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:19,214
The enemy forces at Airlock 14
have surrendered.

725
00:38:19,259 --> 00:38:21,491
We've taken several prisoners.

726
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:24,092
Bring their leaders to me
for questioning.

727
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:24,735
Aye, sir.

728
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:25,292
Aye, sir.

729
00:38:39,929 --> 00:38:41,922
Please don't resist, General.

730
00:38:41,967 --> 00:38:44,335
We don't wish
to use deadly force.

731
00:38:53,087 --> 00:38:54,989
My name is Li Nalas.

732
00:38:55,024 --> 00:38:57,119
Perhaps you've heard of me.

733
00:39:04,307 --> 00:39:07,005
Guards, stop that woman.

734
00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:08,604
What is this blasphemy?

735
00:39:08,648 --> 00:39:11,585
I am Major Kira Nerys,
and I come with proof

736
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,820
that the Cardassians
are behind Minister Jaro's

737
00:39:14,859 --> 00:39:16,589
attempt to take control
of the government.

738
00:39:16,629 --> 00:39:19,897
Major Kira has long been
an outspoken opponent

739
00:39:19,935 --> 00:39:22,201
of the provisional government...

740
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:25,643
of reason, of progress,
and now, finally, of me.

741
00:39:25,712 --> 00:39:28,114
I'm honored
to be included, Major.

742
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:31,281
But I have no intention
of allowing you to disrupt

743
00:39:31,323 --> 00:39:34,489
the orderly transition of power
with these wild charges.

744
00:39:34,528 --> 00:39:39,469
This is a manifest padd
from a Kressari vessel.

745
00:39:39,503 --> 00:39:43,169
It bears the thumb scan
of a Cardassian gul

746
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:46,671
who transferred weapons
to that ship.

747
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:51,124
Those weapons were taken
by the Kressari to the Circle.

748
00:39:52,661 --> 00:39:54,289
This coup will deliver Bajor

749
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:56,926
back into the hands
of its greatest enemies.

750
00:39:56,968 --> 00:40:00,702
Are you willing to live
under Cardassian rule again?

751
00:40:00,742 --> 00:40:03,212
I assure you there's nothing
to these accusations.

752
00:40:03,246 --> 00:40:06,412
Then you should have
no objection

753
00:40:06,452 --> 00:40:09,218
to an inspection
of this manifest, Minister.

754
00:40:11,662 --> 00:40:13,460
No, of course not.

755
00:40:13,498 --> 00:40:15,900
We'll adjourn
for the time being.

756
00:40:20,611 --> 00:40:24,015
And let me say that I completely
support this investigation

757
00:40:24,051 --> 00:40:25,849
and fully intend to cooperate.

758
00:40:49,529 --> 00:40:52,695
Colonel, you deliberately
withheld information

759
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:55,571
that was to be
communicated to me.

760
00:40:55,607 --> 00:40:57,577
Information?

761
00:40:57,611 --> 00:40:59,945
Regarding the Cardassians.

762
00:40:59,981 --> 00:41:04,045
Lies, that's all they were.

763
00:41:04,089 --> 00:41:05,580
We have been told

764
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:09,189
the Chamber is in recess,
while evidence

765
00:41:09,232 --> 00:41:11,896
of Cardassian involvement
is being examined.

766
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,906
The Circle is broken, Colonel.

767
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:18,107
I'm returning
to the surface immediately

768
00:41:18,148 --> 00:41:21,279
to consult with the Ministers.

769
00:41:21,319 --> 00:41:25,156
I expect I will
be asked to resign.

770
00:41:28,566 --> 00:41:32,528
Commander, since the provisional
government has prevailed

771
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,668
I believe it is appropriate

772
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:38,945
to return the command
of this station to Starfleet.

773
00:41:41,289 --> 00:41:42,917
Well-fought, sir.

774
00:41:49,304 --> 00:41:50,704
No.

775
00:41:51,641 --> 00:41:52,404
Commander!

776
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:17,250
Off the hook... after all.

777
00:42:41,531 --> 00:42:45,197
Somehow, you figured,
now that he was here

778
00:42:45,238 --> 00:42:47,174
things would be better.

779
00:42:47,207 --> 00:42:49,005
You know, he'd...

780
00:42:50,781 --> 00:42:53,411
he'd find a way
to make things better

781
00:42:53,452 --> 00:42:56,891
because he was a man
who could do that.

782
00:42:56,992 --> 00:43:00,431
A great man.

783
00:43:00,465 --> 00:43:02,833
I wish I knew

784
00:43:02,903 --> 00:43:05,738
where we could find
others like him.

785
00:43:05,774 --> 00:43:08,506
Major, there are heroes
all over Bajor.

786
00:43:10,383 --> 00:43:12,683
I'm sitting with one.

787
00:43:12,721 --> 00:43:14,349
I'm sorry.

788
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:17,590
I... don't feel
like celebrating tonight.

789
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:19,221
Excuse me.

790
00:43:25,977 --> 00:43:28,243
Sir, can I ask you something?

791
00:43:28,281 --> 00:43:29,681
Sure.

792
00:43:29,717 --> 00:43:30,878
About Li Nalas.

793
00:43:30,953 --> 00:43:32,080
Mm-hmm.

794
00:43:32,122 --> 00:43:34,684
Well, listening to Kira
talk about all he was

795
00:43:34,726 --> 00:43:36,889
all he did,
all he was going to do

796
00:43:36,997 --> 00:43:40,231
she makes him sound like
he was larger than life

797
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:43,002
like he was some kind
of military genius

798
00:43:43,042 --> 00:43:45,478
but the Li Nalas
I fought with...

799
00:43:45,513 --> 00:43:49,920
Chief, Li Nalas was the hero
of the Bajoran resistance.

800
00:43:49,953 --> 00:43:52,924
He performed extraordinary
acts of courage for his people

801
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,587
and died for their freedom.

802
00:43:54,629 --> 00:43:58,124
That's how the history books
on Bajor will be written

803
00:43:58,169 --> 00:44:01,801
and that's how I'll remember him
when anybody asks.

804
00:44:01,842 --> 00:44:04,005
Yes, sir.

805
00:44:04,046 --> 00:44:05,878
Dax to Sisko.

806
00:44:05,916 --> 00:44:08,887
The <i>Ganges</i> has just docked
at Pad C, Benjamin.

807
00:44:08,954 --> 00:44:10,183
Acknowledged.

808
00:44:10,223 --> 00:44:11,953
Excuse me, sir.

809
00:44:23,481 --> 00:44:24,676
Dad.
