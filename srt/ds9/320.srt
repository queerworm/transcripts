1
00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:07,403
But I'm sorry, Doctor.

2
00:00:07,442 --> 00:00:09,777
I just don't see the value
of this man's work.

3
00:00:09,815 --> 00:00:11,045
But, Garak, Shakespeare

4
00:00:11,084 --> 00:00:13,317
is one of the giants
of human literature.

5
00:00:13,357 --> 00:00:17,059
I knew Brutus was going
to kill Caesar in the first act.

6
00:00:17,099 --> 00:00:19,867
But Caesar didn't figure it out
until the knife was in his back.

7
00:00:19,906 --> 00:00:21,535
But that's what makes it
a tragedy.

8
00:00:21,576 --> 00:00:22,704
Caesar couldn't conceive

9
00:00:22,746 --> 00:00:24,842
that his best friend
would plot to kill him.

10
00:00:24,885 --> 00:00:27,449
"Tragedy" is not the word
I'd use.

11
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,084
"Farce" would be
more appropriate.

12
00:00:29,128 --> 00:00:30,597
No, no, supposedly this man

13
00:00:30,632 --> 00:00:33,400
is supposed to be a leader
of a great empire

14
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,173
a brilliant military tactician,
and yet he can't see

15
00:00:36,212 --> 00:00:38,149
what's going on
under his own nose.

16
00:00:38,183 --> 00:00:39,914
Hmm.

17
00:00:39,954 --> 00:00:40,944
Doctor, are you in a hurry?

18
00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:42,083
I have to get to the Infirmary.

19
00:00:42,126 --> 00:00:43,755
I've got a lot of work
to do this afternoon.

20
00:00:43,796 --> 00:00:44,764
Oh, you're fortunate.

21
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:45,767
I have more time

22
00:00:45,801 --> 00:00:47,464
on my hands
than I know what to do with.

23
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:48,735
Maybe you could finish
those trousers

24
00:00:48,775 --> 00:00:49,743
I dropped off last week.

25
00:00:49,778 --> 00:00:51,749
Uh, tomorrow.

26
00:00:51,782 --> 00:00:52,772
Tomorrow.

27
00:00:52,818 --> 00:00:54,789
You're going to give
yourself indigestion.

28
00:00:54,823 --> 00:00:56,417
Well, I only have you
to thank for that.

29
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,761
If you hadn't been so late,
I could have enjoyed my lunch.

30
00:00:58,799 --> 00:00:59,858
Well, this isn't the first time

31
00:00:59,902 --> 00:01:01,030
I've seen you
rush through a meal.

32
00:01:01,071 --> 00:01:03,873
You never take the time
to savor your food.

33
00:01:03,911 --> 00:01:05,642
It seems to be
a human characteristic.

34
00:01:05,682 --> 00:01:06,707
Look over there.

35
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:07,879
That Talarian

36
00:01:07,921 --> 00:01:10,951
is barely halfway
through his meal

37
00:01:10,995 --> 00:01:13,661
but his human companion's
plate is empty.

38
00:01:13,701 --> 00:01:15,466
Well maybe he and I
can have dessert

39
00:01:15,506 --> 00:01:18,104
while you and the Talarian
while away the afternoon.

40
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:20,913
But it is a very interesting
sociological phenomenon

41
00:01:20,952 --> 00:01:22,251
don't you think?

42
00:01:22,289 --> 00:01:25,786
For generations now, humankind
has had more than enough food

43
00:01:25,831 --> 00:01:29,135
and yet, you go about your
eating as if you were afraid

44
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:32,270
someone was going to come along
and snatch away your plate.

45
00:01:32,313 --> 00:01:36,483
Garak, why don't you eat
for a while and let me talk?

46
00:01:36,523 --> 00:01:39,325
Fear of starvation amid plenty.

47
00:01:39,396 --> 00:01:44,306
It points to some dark secret
hidden in the human soul

48
00:01:44,342 --> 00:01:47,509
a gnawing hunger.

49
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:49,452
Perhaps someone
should do a study.

50
00:01:49,487 --> 00:01:50,546
Why don't you?

51
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,620
You appear to have
plenty of time on your hands.

52
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:56,466
Doctor, if you want
to have your dessert

53
00:01:56,504 --> 00:01:57,734
please, go ahead.

54
00:01:57,774 --> 00:01:59,243
I won't be offended.

55
00:02:00,446 --> 00:02:01,505
I have to go

56
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,521
and I'm sorry to leave
while you're still eating.

57
00:02:03,555 --> 00:02:05,286
No, no, I'm done as well.

58
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:06,555
But you've hardly
touched your plate.

59
00:02:06,595 --> 00:02:08,793
If you really must know,
I've been nibbling

60
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,667
on Delavian chocolates
all morning.

61
00:02:10,705 --> 00:02:12,334
Where did you get
Delavian chocolates?

62
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:14,277
Well, I promised my supplier
I wouldn't tell

63
00:02:14,314 --> 00:02:16,045
but since I deprived you
of your dessert

64
00:02:16,084 --> 00:02:18,750
I'd be more than happy to bring
some by the Infirmary

65
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:19,885
later this afternoon.

66
00:02:19,927 --> 00:02:21,328
Why, thank you.
I'd like that.

67
00:02:21,364 --> 00:02:22,560
Until then, Doctor?

68
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,933
Uh, Julian.

69
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,337
Major.

70
00:02:25,373 --> 00:02:26,341
Garak.

71
00:02:26,376 --> 00:02:28,745
About those atmospheric
specifications

72
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:31,549
you requested
for the Yalosian Ambassador...

73
00:02:31,588 --> 00:02:33,786
60 percent nitrogen,
10 percent benzene

74
00:02:33,827 --> 00:02:36,391
and the rest hydrogen
fluoride, as I recall.

75
00:02:36,433 --> 00:02:39,201
Well we ran a test in one
of the guest quarters.

76
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,213
The mixture is so corrosive
it dissolved the carpet.

77
00:02:42,247 --> 00:02:44,218
Well, don't look at me.
It's what they breathe.

78
00:02:44,252 --> 00:02:46,655
Oh, then I guess we'll just
have to rip out the carpets.

79
00:02:46,691 --> 00:02:49,357
Be sure not to replace them
with anything red or orange.

80
00:02:49,398 --> 00:02:50,423
Why not?

81
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:52,699
They don't see that part
of the color spectrum.

82
00:02:52,738 --> 00:02:54,675
Is there anything else
I should know

83
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,838
about the Yalosians?

84
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,509
As a matter of fact...

85
00:02:58,787 --> 00:03:00,347
Bashir to Infirmary.

86
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,554
Medical emergency
on the Promenade.

87
00:03:03,932 --> 00:03:05,697
It's Garak's shop.

88
00:03:20,305 --> 00:03:21,399
Oh...

89
00:03:28,725 --> 00:03:29,784
Are you all right?

90
00:03:31,131 --> 00:03:33,534
As well as can be expected.

91
00:03:35,207 --> 00:03:40,208
But I'm afraid your pants won't
be ready tomorrow after all.

92
00:05:48,336 --> 00:05:49,862
Report.

93
00:05:49,906 --> 00:05:51,466
The explosion was caused

94
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,882
by a rupture in the power
conduit behind that wall.

95
00:05:55,921 --> 00:05:57,185
What caused the rupture?

96
00:05:57,223 --> 00:06:00,128
Well, probably an overload
in the ODN juncture.

97
00:06:01,467 --> 00:06:03,631
I take it you don't agree.

98
00:06:03,672 --> 00:06:05,768
Well, let's just say,
I find it odd

99
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:08,409
that a conduit running
behind Garak's shop

100
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,750
should just happen to overload.

101
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:12,020
So you think someone
ruptured it deliberately?

102
00:06:12,059 --> 00:06:13,460
I wouldn't be surprised.

103
00:06:13,496 --> 00:06:15,296
It stands to reason that a man

104
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:17,601
with Garak's past
would have enemies.

105
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,667
I'm detecting traces
of nitrilin.

106
00:06:19,711 --> 00:06:21,944
Nitrilin is extremely unstable.

107
00:06:21,983 --> 00:06:23,612
And very rare.

108
00:06:23,653 --> 00:06:25,624
It couldn't have come
from the power conduit.

109
00:06:25,658 --> 00:06:30,192
This could be the residue
from a micro-explosive device

110
00:06:30,237 --> 00:06:34,339
planted on the conduit
and rigged to cause a rupture.

111
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:36,850
Making the explosion
look like an accident.

112
00:06:36,886 --> 00:06:38,185
Exactly.

113
00:06:38,222 --> 00:06:39,657
Hmm.

114
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:41,321
Sisko to Ops.

115
00:06:41,363 --> 00:06:42,764
Go ahead, Commander.

116
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,531
Delay the departure
of all vessels

117
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:45,800
until further notice.

118
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,537
I have reason to believe

119
00:06:47,578 --> 00:06:50,848
that someone may have tried
to kill Mr. Garak.

120
00:06:55,564 --> 00:06:59,939
Who would want to kill me,
a simple tailor?

121
00:06:59,974 --> 00:07:02,070
A simple tailor.

122
00:07:02,112 --> 00:07:04,606
A simple tailor
who used to be an agent

123
00:07:04,652 --> 00:07:06,178
of the Obsidian Order.

124
00:07:06,223 --> 00:07:07,282
The Obsidian Order.

125
00:07:07,325 --> 00:07:09,762
Constable, you shouldn't
put too much stock

126
00:07:09,798 --> 00:07:12,635
in the good Doctor's
flights of fancy.

127
00:07:12,671 --> 00:07:15,405
Now, are you sure this explosion
wasn't an accident?

128
00:07:15,445 --> 00:07:19,079
Because I can't think of anyone
who would wish me harm.

129
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,920
Someone tried to kill you,
Garak.

130
00:07:20,957 --> 00:07:23,428
Whoever it was may try again,
so if I were you

131
00:07:23,464 --> 00:07:25,993
I would give this matter
some serious thought.

132
00:07:26,037 --> 00:07:28,065
Well, let me see.

133
00:07:28,108 --> 00:07:32,517
I mean, there's the Nausicaan
whose wedding suit I misplaced

134
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,716
and the Yridian I owe money to

135
00:07:34,758 --> 00:07:37,697
and of course,
there's always Major Kira.

136
00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:39,132
This is serious, Garak.

137
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:40,262
I'm being serious.

138
00:07:40,305 --> 00:07:42,435
I don't think she likes me.

139
00:07:42,476 --> 00:07:46,851
She doesn't, but if she
wanted you dead, you would be.

140
00:07:46,887 --> 00:07:47,877
You do have a point.

141
00:07:47,922 --> 00:07:49,255
Could this attempt on your life

142
00:07:49,292 --> 00:07:51,559
have anything
to do with the reason

143
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:53,591
you were exiled from Cardassia?

144
00:07:53,636 --> 00:07:55,401
Oh, I seriously doubt
the Finance Ministry

145
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,844
would try to have me killed
for failure to pay my taxes.

146
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:02,755
You expect us to believe that's
the reason you were exiled?

147
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,593
Do you think I would lie
about a thing like that?

148
00:08:05,698 --> 00:08:07,601
It's not something I'm proud of.

149
00:08:07,636 --> 00:08:11,806
I don't like explosions
going off on my station, Garak.

150
00:08:11,847 --> 00:08:13,750
Innocent people
could have been hurt.

151
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,185
You could have been killed.

152
00:08:15,221 --> 00:08:17,887
Now if there's anything you know
you're not telling us

153
00:08:17,927 --> 00:08:19,328
I suggest you start talking.

154
00:08:19,364 --> 00:08:23,032
I've told you everything
I can think of.

155
00:08:25,813 --> 00:08:27,077
All right, then.

156
00:08:27,116 --> 00:08:30,648
I'll investigate
the "leads" you've given us.

157
00:08:30,758 --> 00:08:31,748
If there's anyone else

158
00:08:31,795 --> 00:08:33,629
you think I should
talk to, let me know.

159
00:08:33,665 --> 00:08:34,633
I certainly will.

160
00:08:34,668 --> 00:08:37,266
We've assigned
a security detail to you.

161
00:08:37,307 --> 00:08:40,178
I suggest you stay
as close to them as possible.

162
00:08:46,729 --> 00:08:48,494
Ah.

163
00:08:48,534 --> 00:08:50,528
Someone should do a study.

164
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:51,563
A study?

165
00:08:51,608 --> 00:08:53,943
To try and figure out
why some people

166
00:08:53,981 --> 00:08:56,384
can't bring themselves
to trust anyone

167
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,188
even if it's
in their own best interest.

168
00:08:59,227 --> 00:09:01,460
Why is it no one
ever believes me

169
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,663
even when I'm
telling the truth?

170
00:09:03,704 --> 00:09:05,173
Have you ever heard

171
00:09:05,207 --> 00:09:08,443
the story about the boy
who cried wolf?

172
00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:09,576
No.

173
00:09:09,618 --> 00:09:12,819
It's a children's story
about a young shepherd boy

174
00:09:12,859 --> 00:09:15,194
who gets lonely
while tending his flock

175
00:09:15,231 --> 00:09:17,259
so he cries out to the villagers

176
00:09:17,303 --> 00:09:19,171
that a wolf is
attacking the sheep.

177
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,700
The people come running

178
00:09:20,745 --> 00:09:22,716
but of course, there's no wolf.

179
00:09:22,816 --> 00:09:24,581
He claims that it's run away

180
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,989
and the villagers praise him
for his vigilance.

181
00:09:27,027 --> 00:09:28,724
Clever lad.

182
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:31,199
Charming story.

183
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,210
I'm not finished.

184
00:09:34,244 --> 00:09:36,876
The next day,
the boy does it again

185
00:09:36,917 --> 00:09:38,216
and the next, too

186
00:09:38,253 --> 00:09:41,226
and on the fourth day,
a wolf really comes.

187
00:09:41,261 --> 00:09:43,459
The boy cries out
at the top of his lungs

188
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,991
but the villagers ignore him

189
00:09:45,036 --> 00:09:48,134
and the boy and his flock
are gobbled up.

190
00:09:48,177 --> 00:09:50,444
Well, that's a little graphic
for children

191
00:09:50,483 --> 00:09:51,451
wouldn't you say?

192
00:09:51,485 --> 00:09:55,951
But the point is,
if you lie all the time

193
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:58,992
nobody's going to believe you

194
00:09:59,036 --> 00:10:01,200
even when you're
telling the truth.

195
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:04,680
Are you sure
that's the point, Doctor?

196
00:10:04,716 --> 00:10:05,810
Of course.

197
00:10:05,853 --> 00:10:08,324
What else could it be?

198
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:10,853
That you should never
tell the same lie twice.

199
00:10:30,178 --> 00:10:31,647
You wanted to see me?

200
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:33,743
I have bad news for you.

201
00:10:33,786 --> 00:10:36,987
Major Kira has
an airtight alibi.

202
00:10:37,028 --> 00:10:38,862
I thought you might want

203
00:10:38,898 --> 00:10:41,096
to look over
the passenger manifests

204
00:10:41,137 --> 00:10:43,837
of ships that recently
came to the station.

205
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:46,714
To see if I recognize anyone
who might wish me harm?

206
00:10:46,751 --> 00:10:48,551
Exactly.

207
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:50,423
I suggest

208
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:52,760
you start
with the most recent arrivals

209
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,462
and work your way backwards.

210
00:10:59,013 --> 00:11:01,314
Well, don't worry about me,
Constable.

211
00:11:01,353 --> 00:11:02,822
I can manage on my own.

212
00:11:02,856 --> 00:11:05,522
I'm not about to leave you
alone in here

213
00:11:05,562 --> 00:11:08,399
so you can look through
my security files.

214
00:11:08,437 --> 00:11:09,405
What makes you think

215
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,033
I haven't already
looked through them?

216
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:15,116
I'm joking, of course.

217
00:11:16,121 --> 00:11:17,681
Of course.

218
00:11:20,632 --> 00:11:26,442
No, I'm afraid I don't
recognize any of these names.

219
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,074
The bomb could have
been planted

220
00:11:28,116 --> 00:11:29,278
days ago or even weeks.

221
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,791
I suggest you keep going back
just to be sure.

222
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:33,488
Oh, well,
this could take forever.

223
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:34,498
I should think

224
00:11:34,532 --> 00:11:36,400
you'd have plenty
of time on your hands

225
00:11:36,437 --> 00:11:39,410
now that your shop is
no longer open for business.

226
00:11:39,444 --> 00:11:40,434
Hmm.

227
00:11:41,616 --> 00:11:42,675
Odo, I...

228
00:11:49,368 --> 00:11:51,669
I finished running
the bio-molecular scan

229
00:11:51,706 --> 00:11:52,674
you asked me for.

230
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,906
I found traces of living tissue

231
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:57,682
on the bulkhead
around the blast site.

232
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,693
This looks like the remains
of a pheromonic sensor.

233
00:12:00,728 --> 00:12:01,457
A what?

234
00:12:01,497 --> 00:12:02,727
It's triggered

235
00:12:02,766 --> 00:12:06,138
when a person of a particular
species gets within range.

236
00:12:06,174 --> 00:12:10,291
In this case, a Cardassian.
Me.

237
00:12:12,496 --> 00:12:16,096
They're known to be favored
by Flaxian assassins

238
00:12:16,138 --> 00:12:17,801
and it just so happens

239
00:12:17,843 --> 00:12:21,808
a Flaxian came aboard
the station just this morning.

240
00:12:29,871 --> 00:12:33,038
So, Mister... Retaya

241
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:35,643
your papers indicate
that you're a merchant.

242
00:12:35,684 --> 00:12:40,458
I deal in fine wares,
mostly fabrics and fragrances.

243
00:12:40,496 --> 00:12:43,025
According to my information

244
00:12:43,069 --> 00:12:48,743
you were a suspect in the murder
of Dekora Assan on Japori II.

245
00:12:48,783 --> 00:12:50,548
I was cleared on those charges.

246
00:12:50,654 --> 00:12:52,818
It was a case
of mistaken identity.

247
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:55,957
This is your sample case,
I take it.

248
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,059
Yes.

249
00:12:59,609 --> 00:13:01,637
Well, how fortunate.

250
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:03,014
As it happens

251
00:13:03,051 --> 00:13:06,685
I'm looking for a gift
for a friend.

252
00:13:06,726 --> 00:13:08,890
A lady friend?

253
00:13:08,931 --> 00:13:10,298
Exactly.

254
00:13:10,335 --> 00:13:14,539
Unfortunately, I don't
have a sense of smell.

255
00:13:14,645 --> 00:13:19,088
Perhaps you could describe
this fragrance for me.

256
00:13:19,122 --> 00:13:22,756
It has a somewhat...
floral bouquet.

257
00:13:22,797 --> 00:13:24,631
Hmm.

258
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:29,711
We have a Cardassian tailor
here on the station

259
00:13:29,748 --> 00:13:30,716
named Garak.

260
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,310
There was an explosion

261
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:35,259
in his shop not long
after you arrived.

262
00:13:35,295 --> 00:13:37,129
I felt the blast.

263
00:13:37,165 --> 00:13:38,464
Was he hurt?

264
00:13:38,502 --> 00:13:40,267
Not seriously.

265
00:13:40,307 --> 00:13:41,297
Hmm?

266
00:13:41,342 --> 00:13:45,512
That one is more musky
than the first.

267
00:13:45,552 --> 00:13:46,646
Oh.

268
00:13:47,992 --> 00:13:52,766
Tell me, where were you
when the explosion occurred?

269
00:13:52,803 --> 00:13:53,862
The Ferengi's bar.

270
00:13:53,906 --> 00:13:56,743
I went there as soon
as I arrived this morning.

271
00:13:56,779 --> 00:13:58,339
Mm-hmm.

272
00:14:01,156 --> 00:14:02,591
Huh?

273
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:08,801
I suppose I would have to
describe that one as... spicy.

274
00:14:08,842 --> 00:14:11,040
Mm... I see.

275
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,210
And how long were you
at Quark's?

276
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:14,778
The rest of the day.

277
00:14:14,822 --> 00:14:18,889
Right up until your Deputy
came and brought me here.

278
00:14:20,871 --> 00:14:24,744
So, have you found something
for your lady friend?

279
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,978
Almost.

280
00:14:28,021 --> 00:14:33,399
I think she would like
something both floral...

281
00:14:33,434 --> 00:14:34,835
and musky.

282
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:39,472
Perhaps...
if we mixed these two?

283
00:14:39,515 --> 00:14:40,574
Why not?

284
00:14:44,794 --> 00:14:46,594
Very nice.

285
00:14:46,632 --> 00:14:48,226
But on the other hand

286
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:51,174
she's also quite fond
of spicy things.

287
00:14:52,212 --> 00:14:53,875
Maybe we could add...

288
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,716
a drop of this as well.

289
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,452
I really don't think
they would go well together.

290
00:14:58,494 --> 00:15:00,123
Let's find out.

291
00:15:00,164 --> 00:15:05,074
I really don't think your lady
friend will like the aroma.

292
00:15:05,109 --> 00:15:06,134
Much less the fact that

293
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:08,173
when these three fragrances
are combined

294
00:15:08,217 --> 00:15:09,686
they produce a gaseous mixture

295
00:15:09,788 --> 00:15:13,490
that can trigger a fatal heart
attack when inhaled.

296
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:16,594
I had no idea.

297
00:15:16,637 --> 00:15:18,231
Then why did you stop me
from mixing them?

298
00:15:18,275 --> 00:15:19,437
As I said

299
00:15:19,477 --> 00:15:23,476
I simply didn't think your
friend would like the aroma.

300
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:29,725
Unless you have any more
questions, I'd like to go now.

301
00:15:29,802 --> 00:15:33,003
I have deliveries to make
on Cardassia.

302
00:15:33,043 --> 00:15:36,711
I'll let you know when you
can leave the station.

303
00:15:55,831 --> 00:15:58,268
Everything's set.

304
00:15:58,304 --> 00:16:01,277
The transponder is on board
the Flaxian's ship.

305
00:16:01,311 --> 00:16:02,871
You're sure he won't find it?

306
00:16:02,915 --> 00:16:04,145
Not a chance.

307
00:16:04,184 --> 00:16:06,519
I've hidden it inside
the ship's magneton relay.

308
00:16:06,556 --> 00:16:07,889
You'll be able to track him

309
00:16:07,927 --> 00:16:10,194
as long as you stay
within half a light year.

310
00:16:11,335 --> 00:16:12,770
Who do you think
he's going to lead you to?

311
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,403
If I knew that, I wouldn't
have to follow him.

312
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:27,231
Oh, I was wondering
when you'd get here.

313
00:16:27,273 --> 00:16:28,970
The Flaxian left
two minutes ago.

314
00:16:29,011 --> 00:16:31,677
If we're going to follow him,
we'd better get moving.

315
00:16:31,717 --> 00:16:34,154
What makes you think
I'm going to follow him?

316
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,249
I happen to know

317
00:16:35,292 --> 00:16:38,129
that you're too dogged
an investigator to allow

318
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:41,229
the only witness in this case
to simply disappear.

319
00:16:41,273 --> 00:16:42,298
Oh, congratulations.

320
00:16:42,342 --> 00:16:44,813
Your powers of deduction
are truly astonishing.

321
00:16:44,849 --> 00:16:46,580
Now if you will kindly disembark

322
00:16:46,619 --> 00:16:49,717
I will get on
with my dogged investigation.

323
00:16:49,761 --> 00:16:52,255
I intend to go with you.

324
00:16:54,104 --> 00:16:55,733
Forgive me...

325
00:16:55,775 --> 00:16:57,746
but are you making a joke?

326
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,876
Cardassian humor escapes me.

327
00:16:59,951 --> 00:17:00,919
I'm quite serious.

328
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:03,049
Believe me, when someone
tries to kill you

329
00:17:03,092 --> 00:17:04,322
it's no laughing matter.

330
00:17:04,362 --> 00:17:05,661
Perhaps, but I don't

331
00:17:05,698 --> 00:17:07,828
require your company
on this trip.

332
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:10,468
My presence
could be most helpful.

333
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:13,814
Especially if the Flaxian
goes into Cardassian space.

334
00:17:13,851 --> 00:17:14,945
I am not interested

335
00:17:14,987 --> 00:17:17,151
in debating
your usefulness to me.

336
00:17:17,193 --> 00:17:18,662
I hate to interrupt you

337
00:17:18,696 --> 00:17:21,260
but the Flaxian
is getting farther away.

338
00:17:21,303 --> 00:17:24,037
Now, I assume you've placed
a tracking device on his ship

339
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:26,309
but if we don't get started soon

340
00:17:26,348 --> 00:17:28,581
he's going to get out of range.

341
00:17:36,606 --> 00:17:37,905
<i>Rio Grande</i> to Ops.

342
00:17:38,009 --> 00:17:40,071
Request permission to depart.

343
00:17:40,114 --> 00:17:42,244
Permission granted.

344
00:17:42,286 --> 00:17:43,276
Trust me, Constable

345
00:17:43,322 --> 00:17:47,058
I can be a most pleasant
traveling companion.

346
00:17:47,098 --> 00:17:49,900
And this promises to be
an interesting trip.

347
00:18:02,936 --> 00:18:05,500
The tracking device
is working perfectly.

348
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:08,276
If I'm reading this correctly...
and I'm no expert...

349
00:18:08,316 --> 00:18:12,189
it looks like the Flaxian ship
is about to go into warp.

350
00:18:23,485 --> 00:18:26,857
Well... it seems

351
00:18:26,892 --> 00:18:30,959
that our "interesting trip"
has just been cut short.

352
00:18:37,819 --> 00:18:41,157
According to our sensor logs,
the Flaxian ship exploded

353
00:18:41,193 --> 00:18:43,164
the moment its warp
drive was engaged.

354
00:18:43,198 --> 00:18:44,497
Was there malfunction?

355
00:18:44,535 --> 00:18:45,902
Well, that's what I thought
at first.

356
00:18:45,938 --> 00:18:49,002
Then I analyzed the telemetry
from the transponder

357
00:18:49,113 --> 00:18:51,277
I planted on board
the Flaxian ship.

358
00:18:52,654 --> 00:18:54,625
Just before the explosion

359
00:18:54,659 --> 00:18:56,253
there was
an interference pattern

360
00:18:56,297 --> 00:18:57,664
in the transponder's signal.

361
00:18:57,701 --> 00:18:59,501
This interference
could have been caused

362
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,007
by a forced neutrino inversion.

363
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,237
The Romulans.

364
00:19:02,278 --> 00:19:06,243
They use neutrino inverters
in their explosive devices.

365
00:19:06,288 --> 00:19:08,954
Why would the Romulans want
to destroy the Flaxian's ship?

366
00:19:08,993 --> 00:19:09,841
One possibility

367
00:19:09,975 --> 00:19:12,846
is that the Romulans hired
the Flaxian to kill Garak

368
00:19:12,882 --> 00:19:16,152
and then killed the Flaxian
when he failed in his mission.

369
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:18,558
Do you have any evidence
to support that?

370
00:19:18,596 --> 00:19:22,503
It's only a supposition,
but it fits the available facts.

371
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:24,509
All right, Mr. Garak.

372
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:27,380
Do you know why the Romulans
might hire someone to kill you?

373
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:28,681
I have no idea.

374
00:19:28,787 --> 00:19:30,655
I'm getting tired
of hearing you say that.

375
00:19:30,692 --> 00:19:32,457
How long do you expect us
to believe...

376
00:19:32,495 --> 00:19:34,192
He's telling the truth,
Commander.

377
00:19:34,233 --> 00:19:36,431
He doesn't know why the Romulans
would try to kill him.

378
00:19:36,472 --> 00:19:38,568
What makes you so sure?

379
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,549
Because if he did know,
he'd already be spinning out

380
00:19:41,584 --> 00:19:44,386
an elaborate web of lies
to cover up the truth.

381
00:19:44,424 --> 00:19:45,723
Well, the truth

382
00:19:45,794 --> 00:19:48,995
is usually just an excuse
for lack of imagination.

383
00:19:49,035 --> 00:19:50,094
Is it?

384
00:19:50,138 --> 00:19:53,476
If you want to know what
the Romulans have against me

385
00:19:53,513 --> 00:19:55,244
you'll have to ask them.

386
00:19:55,283 --> 00:19:56,650
I intend to

387
00:19:56,687 --> 00:19:59,717
but I don't expect them
to be entirely forthcoming.

388
00:20:01,832 --> 00:20:04,464
Yes, we destroyed
the Flaxian's ship.

389
00:20:04,506 --> 00:20:06,066
I have to say
I'm a little surprised

390
00:20:06,109 --> 00:20:07,510
to hear you admit it so easily.

391
00:20:07,546 --> 00:20:08,947
Why would we hide it?

392
00:20:08,983 --> 00:20:12,184
Retaya was wanted for crimes
against the Romulan Empire.

393
00:20:12,224 --> 00:20:14,320
His execution
was perfectly legal.

394
00:20:14,363 --> 00:20:15,798
We have information

395
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,772
that he may have worked
as an assassin.

396
00:20:18,807 --> 00:20:20,801
I have nothing
to corroborate that

397
00:20:20,912 --> 00:20:22,906
though it wouldn't surprise me.

398
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,544
Well, shortly
after he arrived here

399
00:20:24,587 --> 00:20:26,717
someone tried
to kill a Cardassian

400
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:27,749
who lives aboard this station.

401
00:20:29,332 --> 00:20:30,926
That would be Mr. Garak...

402
00:20:30,969 --> 00:20:33,065
a cobbler, I believe.

403
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:35,511
A tailor, actually.

404
00:20:35,546 --> 00:20:37,744
I'll correct our records.

405
00:20:37,785 --> 00:20:40,383
That is, if he's still alive.

406
00:20:40,425 --> 00:20:41,860
He is.

407
00:20:41,895 --> 00:20:45,199
Well.
Is there anything else?

408
00:20:45,237 --> 00:20:47,470
One more thing.

409
00:20:47,509 --> 00:20:51,781
How long had the Tal Shiar
been looking for Retaya?

410
00:20:51,819 --> 00:20:54,120
Nearly a year. Why?

411
00:20:54,158 --> 00:20:55,320
Isn't it curious

412
00:20:55,361 --> 00:20:57,855
that you finally
caught up with him here

413
00:20:57,901 --> 00:21:00,931
just hours after he attempted
to kill Mr. Garak?

414
00:21:00,974 --> 00:21:03,845
We're just grateful
to have found him at all.

415
00:21:03,948 --> 00:21:07,616
Now, if you're finished,
Commander

416
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:09,685
I have other matters
to attend to.

417
00:21:11,466 --> 00:21:12,662
Hmm!

418
00:21:12,702 --> 00:21:14,433
I take it you don't
believe her either?

419
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:15,999
No.

420
00:21:16,044 --> 00:21:17,138
But the question still remains.

421
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,344
Why would the Romulans
want to have Garak killed?

422
00:21:19,385 --> 00:21:21,288
I don't know.

423
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:23,760
Considering those uniforms
of theirs, you'd think

424
00:21:23,796 --> 00:21:26,290
they'd appreciate
a decent tailor.

425
00:21:26,335 --> 00:21:30,437
So, where does this leave
your investigation?

426
00:21:30,478 --> 00:21:31,572
At a standstill.

427
00:21:31,615 --> 00:21:35,021
We don't know that the
Romulans hired the Flaxian.

428
00:21:35,056 --> 00:21:37,289
We don't even know
that it was Retaya

429
00:21:37,328 --> 00:21:38,854
who tried to kill Garak.

430
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:39,923
All we do know is

431
00:21:40,035 --> 00:21:42,165
that a bomb went off
in Garak's shop.

432
00:21:42,207 --> 00:21:43,767
All right...

433
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,747
then let's start with him.

434
00:21:45,782 --> 00:21:48,253
What do we know about Garak?

435
00:21:48,288 --> 00:21:51,820
He was exiled from Cardassia,
for what reason, we're not sure.

436
00:21:51,863 --> 00:21:53,628
He never leaves the station.

437
00:21:53,668 --> 00:21:56,470
He avoids contact
with other Cardassians.

438
00:21:56,508 --> 00:21:57,738
And it's possible

439
00:21:57,777 --> 00:22:00,875
that he was once an intelligence
agent of the Obsidian Order.

440
00:22:00,918 --> 00:22:03,321
A very strong possibility,
Commander.

441
00:22:03,357 --> 00:22:04,382
Agreed.

442
00:22:04,427 --> 00:22:06,330
So we can assume
that this attempt on his life

443
00:22:06,364 --> 00:22:07,833
had something
to do with the Order.

444
00:22:07,867 --> 00:22:12,503
Unfortunately, he's rather
uncooperative when it comes

445
00:22:12,546 --> 00:22:14,540
to answering questions
about his past.

446
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:16,349
And the Obsidian Order
is uncooperative

447
00:22:16,388 --> 00:22:17,948
when it comes
to answering questions

448
00:22:18,026 --> 00:22:19,188
about their former agents.

449
00:22:19,228 --> 00:22:21,165
Ordinarily, yes.

450
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,171
What do you mean?

451
00:22:23,205 --> 00:22:27,545
I have certain resources
in the Cardassian government.

452
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,990
I take it you don't want
to elaborate on that?

453
00:22:34,197 --> 00:22:36,430
I'd rather not.

454
00:22:36,469 --> 00:22:39,910
But I would like to request
the use of a runabout.

455
00:22:39,944 --> 00:22:41,675
Granted.

456
00:22:41,716 --> 00:22:43,516
Thank you, sir.

457
00:23:19,874 --> 00:23:21,868
Stop there.

458
00:23:24,084 --> 00:23:25,383
Where are you?

459
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,049
Nearby.

460
00:23:27,157 --> 00:23:30,358
I've changed my appearance
since last we saw each other.

461
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:31,891
I don't want you to see me.

462
00:23:31,936 --> 00:23:34,670
I need some information.

463
00:23:34,709 --> 00:23:37,409
Is this about the tailor shop?

464
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:38,474
Yes.

465
00:23:38,518 --> 00:23:39,577
I didn't do it.

466
00:23:39,621 --> 00:23:41,819
I wasn't going to ask you that.

467
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:45,562
I think the Romulans
tried to kill Garak.

468
00:23:45,602 --> 00:23:47,573
Very good, Odo.

469
00:23:47,607 --> 00:23:49,737
I see working for the Bajorans

470
00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:52,547
hasn't entirely dulled
your instincts.

471
00:23:52,586 --> 00:23:56,118
My question is, "why?"

472
00:23:56,194 --> 00:23:58,928
You'd have to ask the Romulans.

473
00:23:58,968 --> 00:24:02,032
But I do know
that you are investigating

474
00:24:02,075 --> 00:24:06,211
a very insignificant piece
of a much larger puzzle.

475
00:24:06,251 --> 00:24:09,224
What do you mean?

476
00:24:09,258 --> 00:24:11,456
There's been a great deal
of unusual

477
00:24:11,497 --> 00:24:13,593
Romulan activity
these past weeks.

478
00:24:13,636 --> 00:24:16,302
Cloaked ships believed
to be warbirds

479
00:24:16,342 --> 00:24:18,940
have been detected near
the Cardassian border...

480
00:24:18,982 --> 00:24:20,679
troop movements...

481
00:24:20,719 --> 00:24:23,590
communication activity...

482
00:24:23,626 --> 00:24:27,898
Sounds like they're
preparing for an invasion.

483
00:24:27,936 --> 00:24:30,237
It has occurred to us

484
00:24:30,276 --> 00:24:32,645
and we're ready for it,
if it should happen.

485
00:24:32,682 --> 00:24:35,814
But it doesn't make any sense.

486
00:24:35,855 --> 00:24:38,258
Does war ever make sense?

487
00:24:38,295 --> 00:24:44,139
Still the wry observer
of humanoid folly.

488
00:24:44,176 --> 00:24:48,312
Tell me, do you still do
the Cardassian neck trick?

489
00:24:50,256 --> 00:24:52,352
No, I don't.

490
00:24:52,395 --> 00:24:55,858
Pity.
You were so good at it.

491
00:24:55,903 --> 00:25:00,039
Garak isn't the only former
operative in the Order

492
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,053
who had an "unfortunate
incident" yesterday

493
00:25:03,087 --> 00:25:04,647
but he's the luckiest.

494
00:25:04,692 --> 00:25:07,163
The other five didn't survive.

495
00:25:07,264 --> 00:25:11,639
Five operatives were
killed yesterday?

496
00:25:11,674 --> 00:25:13,405
"Killed"?

497
00:25:13,446 --> 00:25:14,779
No.

498
00:25:14,816 --> 00:25:18,017
Three died from "natural causes"

499
00:25:18,056 --> 00:25:20,961
the other two perished
in "accidents."

500
00:25:20,997 --> 00:25:23,765
Quite a coincidence.

501
00:25:23,804 --> 00:25:26,402
If you believe in coincidence.

502
00:25:26,443 --> 00:25:28,607
I take it you think
the Romulans

503
00:25:28,649 --> 00:25:31,213
had something to do
with their deaths?

504
00:25:31,289 --> 00:25:35,629
There were certain indications
of their involvement.

505
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:38,970
That still leaves us
with the question, "why?"

506
00:25:39,007 --> 00:25:40,066
Here.

507
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:47,056
Those are the names
of the five dead operatives.

508
00:25:47,093 --> 00:25:50,225
I suggest you show that to Garak

509
00:25:50,267 --> 00:25:52,933
then ask him that question.

510
00:25:52,974 --> 00:25:55,275
I'll do that.

511
00:25:55,379 --> 00:25:58,580
I trust you'll agree
that this information

512
00:25:58,621 --> 00:26:00,615
satisfies my debt to you.

513
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,151
Agreed.

514
00:26:02,196 --> 00:26:04,930
However, if you
do learn something

515
00:26:04,969 --> 00:26:08,569
from your tailor,
and wish to share it with me

516
00:26:08,611 --> 00:26:11,243
I would be indebted
to you again.

517
00:26:11,351 --> 00:26:14,587
I'll consider it.

518
00:26:26,741 --> 00:26:28,712
They're all dead?!

519
00:26:28,746 --> 00:26:31,685
I take it you're not going
to mourn their passing?

520
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,451
Oh, quite the contrary!

521
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:36,225
In fact, if these were
different circumstances

522
00:26:36,265 --> 00:26:37,859
I'd be celebrating tonight.

523
00:26:37,902 --> 00:26:39,702
So you did know them?

524
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,577
Oh, yes, we were
quite well-acquainted.

525
00:26:42,613 --> 00:26:44,207
In the Obsidian Order?

526
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,346
Oh, Constable, we've been
down this road before.

527
00:26:46,389 --> 00:26:47,414
I don't see why...

528
00:26:47,457 --> 00:26:49,086
I've had enough
of your dissembling, Garak!

529
00:26:49,162 --> 00:26:50,392
I am not Dr. Bashir

530
00:26:50,431 --> 00:26:53,233
and we are not sparing
amiably over lunch!

531
00:26:53,271 --> 00:26:55,435
Now you dragged me
into this investigation

532
00:26:55,477 --> 00:26:57,106
and you are now going
to cooperate with me!

533
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:58,116
"Dragged you in"?

534
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,087
I don't know
what you're talking...

535
00:27:00,121 --> 00:27:02,592
You blew up your own shop,
Garak!

536
00:27:06,035 --> 00:27:08,438
Well...

537
00:27:08,475 --> 00:27:11,243
I don't think I've ever seen

538
00:27:11,282 --> 00:27:14,050
that particular expression
on your face.

539
00:27:14,089 --> 00:27:15,558
Is it surprise?

540
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:18,086
Yes, Constable, it is.

541
00:27:18,164 --> 00:27:19,758
I'm surprised that you

542
00:27:19,802 --> 00:27:22,604
could come to this
unlikely conclusion.

543
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:23,941
Oh, drop the pretense.

544
00:27:23,978 --> 00:27:26,780
I knew as soon as I spoke
with the Flaxian.

545
00:27:26,818 --> 00:27:29,814
Assassins don't like
varying their methods.

546
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,386
He planned to poison you.

547
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,959
I think you spotted
him on the station

548
00:27:34,002 --> 00:27:35,733
and then blew up your own shop

549
00:27:35,774 --> 00:27:37,608
so that I'd begin
an investigation.

550
00:27:37,644 --> 00:27:39,740
That seems like
a very elaborate way

551
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:40,979
to get you involved.

552
00:27:41,019 --> 00:27:44,619
If I needed your help
I could have just asked.

553
00:27:44,661 --> 00:27:46,096
But you couldn't be sure

554
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:48,729
that I'd take you seriously,
or that I'd help you.

555
00:27:48,771 --> 00:27:53,977
Besides, I think
you secretly enjoyed

556
00:27:54,017 --> 00:27:56,181
destroying your own shop.

557
00:27:56,290 --> 00:28:00,026
Well, I admit watching it burn
wasn't exactly tragic.

558
00:28:00,065 --> 00:28:02,002
Whether or not you
want to admit it

559
00:28:02,037 --> 00:28:05,307
you pulled me into this case,
and now you're stuck with me.

560
00:28:05,344 --> 00:28:07,144
I want to know
who those men were

561
00:28:07,216 --> 00:28:09,312
and what your connection
was to them.

562
00:28:20,047 --> 00:28:23,579
We were all associates
of Enabran Tain.

563
00:28:23,622 --> 00:28:28,726
Enabran Tain, the former head
of the Obsidian Order.

564
00:28:28,767 --> 00:28:30,931
He retired some years ago.

565
00:28:30,972 --> 00:28:34,070
He was, I might add,
the only head of the agency

566
00:28:34,113 --> 00:28:36,448
who ever lived
long enough to do so.

567
00:28:36,486 --> 00:28:40,952
For some time, we were
his most trusted advisors.

568
00:28:40,996 --> 00:28:42,329
Do you have

569
00:28:42,366 --> 00:28:45,134
any idea why the Romulans
would want you all dead?

570
00:28:45,173 --> 00:28:47,337
I don't know...

571
00:28:47,378 --> 00:28:49,349
but Tain might.

572
00:28:49,383 --> 00:28:50,477
That is unless he

573
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:53,219
suffered an "unfortunate
accident" as well.

574
00:28:53,259 --> 00:28:57,030
That is a distinct possibility.

575
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:02,079
May I use
your communications system?

576
00:29:02,114 --> 00:29:03,378
By all means.

577
00:29:15,112 --> 00:29:18,678
Well, that's an interesting way
of scrambling a signal.

578
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,748
Yes, I thought you
might appreciate it

579
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:22,022
on an aesthetic level.

580
00:29:22,061 --> 00:29:23,929
Ah, here we are.

581
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:35,724
Mila.

582
00:29:37,732 --> 00:29:38,791
Elim.

583
00:29:41,475 --> 00:29:44,642
I never thought
I'd see your face again.

584
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:47,784
I need to speak to Tain.

585
00:29:47,823 --> 00:29:49,122
It's urgent.

586
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:52,030
You can't.
He isn't here.

587
00:29:52,066 --> 00:29:53,558
Where is he?

588
00:29:53,604 --> 00:29:55,233
I don't know.

589
00:29:55,275 --> 00:29:57,178
He left yesterday
in a great hurry.

590
00:29:57,213 --> 00:29:58,773
He wouldn't tell me where...

591
00:29:58,816 --> 00:30:01,687
Maybe he realized
someone was coming after him.

592
00:30:01,723 --> 00:30:03,454
He's in trouble, isn't he?

593
00:30:03,494 --> 00:30:05,522
You have to help him, Elim.

594
00:30:05,565 --> 00:30:07,536
I know you're still bitter

595
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:11,740
because of what happened
between the two of you, but...

596
00:30:11,781 --> 00:30:14,652
you must help him, Elim.

597
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:18,094
If you speak to him,
tell him to contact me.

598
00:30:18,129 --> 00:30:23,403
Promise me.
You help him.

599
00:30:24,445 --> 00:30:26,712
I promise.

600
00:30:31,461 --> 00:30:33,955
I'll need a runabout,
Constable.

601
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,304
We'll need a runabout.

602
00:30:37,342 --> 00:30:39,142
I'm coming with you.

603
00:30:44,325 --> 00:30:45,794
I hope you know
what you're doing, Garak.

604
00:30:45,829 --> 00:30:46,991
So do I.

605
00:30:47,031 --> 00:30:48,865
Is there anything you need
me to do while you're gone?

606
00:30:48,903 --> 00:30:49,962
Like what?

607
00:30:50,005 --> 00:30:51,999
I don't know...
any unfinished business?

608
00:30:52,043 --> 00:30:56,076
Actually, Doctor,
there is something.

609
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,885
Well, what?

610
00:30:57,924 --> 00:30:59,188
If you go into my quarters

611
00:30:59,227 --> 00:31:01,859
and examine the bulkhead
next to the replicator

612
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:04,168
you'll notice
there's a false panel.

613
00:31:04,206 --> 00:31:06,439
Behind that panel,
is a compartment

614
00:31:06,546 --> 00:31:08,380
containing an isolinear rod.

615
00:31:08,416 --> 00:31:11,686
If I'm not back
within 78 hours

616
00:31:11,724 --> 00:31:14,925
I want you to take that rod

617
00:31:14,965 --> 00:31:16,730
and eat it.

618
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:18,262
Eat it?

619
00:31:18,307 --> 00:31:19,742
Mm-hmm.

620
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:21,178
You're joking.

621
00:31:21,214 --> 00:31:23,617
Yes, Doctor, I am.

622
00:31:23,652 --> 00:31:25,850
Very funny.

623
00:31:25,892 --> 00:31:27,760
I thought so.

624
00:31:27,796 --> 00:31:30,131
But the answer to your question,
Doctor, is "no."

625
00:31:30,169 --> 00:31:32,265
There's nothing you can do
for me while I'm away.

626
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,973
Then these are for you.

627
00:31:35,983 --> 00:31:37,977
Delavian chocolates.

628
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,924
But these were meant for you.

629
00:31:39,958 --> 00:31:40,983
I know... I thought

630
00:31:41,028 --> 00:31:43,022
you might need them
more than I do.

631
00:31:43,066 --> 00:31:44,866
Thank you.

632
00:31:46,073 --> 00:31:47,063
Good luck.

633
00:31:47,109 --> 00:31:47,940
Hmm.

634
00:32:00,374 --> 00:32:01,934
We've cleared the station.

635
00:32:01,978 --> 00:32:03,447
Now if you'll be kind enough

636
00:32:03,481 --> 00:32:06,181
to let me know where we're
going, I'll set a course.

637
00:32:06,221 --> 00:32:08,215
Head for the Cardassian border.

638
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,165
We're going to the third planet
of the Unefra system.

639
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,103
How do you know
that's where Tain has gone?

640
00:32:13,138 --> 00:32:14,664
I don't, but he has
a safe house there

641
00:32:14,709 --> 00:32:16,303
that no one's supposed
to know about...

642
00:32:16,346 --> 00:32:18,944
especially me.

643
00:32:18,986 --> 00:32:23,224
That woman, Mila...
who is she?

644
00:32:23,262 --> 00:32:27,933
She's been Tain's housekeeper
and confidant for over 30 years.

645
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:32,482
She seemed almost fond of you.

646
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,019
Is it so hard to believe

647
00:32:35,057 --> 00:32:37,085
that there's one person
in this galaxy

648
00:32:37,129 --> 00:32:39,566
who could regard me
with a certain affection?

649
00:32:39,602 --> 00:32:41,128
Well, I could believe
there's one

650
00:32:41,172 --> 00:32:42,505
but I wouldn't expect it

651
00:32:42,542 --> 00:32:44,911
to be someone who worked
for Enabran Tain.

652
00:32:44,947 --> 00:32:46,610
As I understand it

653
00:32:46,719 --> 00:32:49,624
the two of you didn't part
on the best of terms.

654
00:32:49,726 --> 00:32:51,457
You could say that.

655
00:32:51,496 --> 00:32:55,802
Tain was directly responsible
for my exile from Cardassia.

656
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,540
Then I don't understand...

657
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,744
Why I would be risking my life
to help him?

658
00:33:00,785 --> 00:33:01,879
Exactly.

659
00:33:01,922 --> 00:33:03,016
Yes...

660
00:33:03,057 --> 00:33:05,621
I can see
how that would be puzzling.

661
00:33:11,511 --> 00:33:13,607
All right...

662
00:33:13,649 --> 00:33:15,306
you owe him something.

663
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,411
Ha!
A logical deduction.

664
00:33:17,445 --> 00:33:20,316
I see why you're the Constable.

665
00:33:20,352 --> 00:33:21,912
But it's more than that.

666
00:33:21,956 --> 00:33:24,154
He means something to you.

667
00:33:24,194 --> 00:33:26,631
Something personal?

668
00:33:26,666 --> 00:33:30,768
Ah, now you've just moved
from deduction to supposition.

669
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:32,109
You're not the kind of man

670
00:33:32,147 --> 00:33:34,745
who would go to such lengths
simply to repay a debt.

671
00:33:34,787 --> 00:33:38,991
Are you trying to say that
I have no sense of honor?

672
00:33:39,063 --> 00:33:42,002
Well, that remains to be seen.

673
00:33:42,037 --> 00:33:43,005
Yes.

674
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,408
You wouldn't risk going

675
00:33:45,446 --> 00:33:48,978
into Cardassian space
for just anyone.

676
00:33:49,021 --> 00:33:51,219
It would have to be someone
important to you...

677
00:33:51,259 --> 00:33:54,198
someone you cared about.

678
00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:58,266
I think you were more
than Tain's advisor.

679
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:02,412
I think you were his protégé
and he was your mentor.

680
00:34:02,452 --> 00:34:05,391
That is, until he sent you
into exile.

681
00:34:05,427 --> 00:34:07,898
And yet, despite all that

682
00:34:07,932 --> 00:34:11,965
you care enough about him
to risk your life for him.

683
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:15,313
Or is all that just supposition?

684
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:18,688
Very interesting analysis...

685
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:20,628
very interesting.

686
00:34:20,663 --> 00:34:25,334
Particularly coming from you.

687
00:34:25,374 --> 00:34:27,277
Oh?

688
00:34:33,394 --> 00:34:35,865
It's been my observation

689
00:34:35,899 --> 00:34:40,035
that you always act
from a sense of justice

690
00:34:40,076 --> 00:34:43,208
or at least,
what you consider justice.

691
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,314
There's no feeling
behind what you do...

692
00:34:46,358 --> 00:34:49,422
no emotion beyond
a certain distaste

693
00:34:49,465 --> 00:34:51,902
for loose ends and disorder.

694
00:34:51,938 --> 00:34:57,384
You don't know what it means
to care about someone, do you?

695
00:34:57,417 --> 00:35:01,290
People are just
interesting creatures

696
00:35:01,327 --> 00:35:04,232
to be studied and analyzed.

697
00:35:04,267 --> 00:35:07,639
Is there any point to this?

698
00:35:07,676 --> 00:35:10,649
Only that I find it
interesting

699
00:35:10,683 --> 00:35:14,317
that you ascribe feelings
and motivations to me

700
00:35:14,358 --> 00:35:16,522
that you know nothing about.

701
00:35:16,563 --> 00:35:18,431
Or am I wrong?

702
00:35:18,468 --> 00:35:19,767
Tell me.

703
00:35:19,805 --> 00:35:24,441
Is there one person in this
universe you do care for?

704
00:35:24,482 --> 00:35:26,213
One person who's more

705
00:35:26,254 --> 00:35:29,990
than just an interesting
puzzle to be solved.

706
00:35:30,029 --> 00:35:32,523
Is there, Odo?

707
00:35:32,568 --> 00:35:34,732
Anyone?

708
00:35:34,774 --> 00:35:38,978
If there were, I certainly
wouldn't tell you.

709
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:46,130
And that would be
a wise decision.

710
00:35:59,566 --> 00:36:00,762
I'm taking us out of warp.

711
00:36:00,803 --> 00:36:02,500
We're approaching
the Unefra system.

712
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:05,011
What's that?

713
00:36:05,046 --> 00:36:06,140
I'm detecting

714
00:36:06,215 --> 00:36:09,086
a subspace energy surge
directly above us.

715
00:36:09,123 --> 00:36:11,857
A vessel of some kind
is de-cloaking.

716
00:36:17,911 --> 00:36:20,178
It's a Romulan warbird.

717
00:36:20,216 --> 00:36:22,153
In Cardassian space?

718
00:36:24,091 --> 00:36:25,685
They've locked onto us
with a tractor beam.

719
00:36:25,729 --> 00:36:26,993
Take the helm.

720
00:36:27,033 --> 00:36:29,470
I'll going to try to send out
a distress signal.

721
00:36:29,505 --> 00:36:30,599
I can't pull away.

722
00:36:30,641 --> 00:36:32,635
The tractor lock is too strong.

723
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:35,082
They're jamming
our transmission.

724
00:36:35,118 --> 00:36:36,314
Do you think you got through?

725
00:36:36,355 --> 00:36:37,722
I don't know.

726
00:36:37,758 --> 00:36:40,663
I'm going to hail them,
see what they want.

727
00:36:42,436 --> 00:36:44,839
I think we're about to find out.

728
00:37:01,014 --> 00:37:02,142
Tain.

729
00:37:03,887 --> 00:37:07,225
Ah, Garak, it's good
of you to come.

730
00:37:07,296 --> 00:37:08,663
It spares me the trouble

731
00:37:08,699 --> 00:37:11,228
of having to send
someone else to kill you.

732
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,614
Come in, come in!

733
00:37:22,131 --> 00:37:24,261
It's been a long time, Elim.

734
00:37:24,337 --> 00:37:27,834
So, you're a tailor now.

735
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:30,111
Is this one of your creations?

736
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:33,021
A minor example of my work, yes.

737
00:37:33,057 --> 00:37:34,857
I don't think
I like the neckline.

738
00:37:34,894 --> 00:37:36,956
Well, you always did have
a keen sense of fashion

739
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,301
but you seem to have let it go

740
00:37:39,339 --> 00:37:41,708
along with your
once-trim figure.

741
00:37:44,918 --> 00:37:47,116
Constable Odo.

742
00:37:47,158 --> 00:37:49,254
I've always wanted to meet you.

743
00:37:49,296 --> 00:37:51,233
I wish I could say the same.

744
00:37:51,267 --> 00:37:52,634
Oh, come now.

745
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:55,666
Haven't you ever been the
least bit curious about me

746
00:37:55,712 --> 00:37:58,480
about my relationship
with Garak

747
00:37:58,518 --> 00:38:00,614
or our work
in the Obsidian Order?

748
00:38:00,656 --> 00:38:02,627
I seldom waste time
speculating

749
00:38:02,661 --> 00:38:05,725
about retired spymasters
and their associates.

750
00:38:07,306 --> 00:38:09,243
He's good.

751
00:38:09,278 --> 00:38:12,844
He hides his true feelings
almost as well as you do, Elim.

752
00:38:12,886 --> 00:38:15,518
He'd have made a good
operative in the old days.

753
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:17,894
I had the same thought myself.

754
00:38:17,932 --> 00:38:20,598
But then, those days
are long gone.

755
00:38:20,637 --> 00:38:22,608
At least, they are for me.

756
00:38:22,642 --> 00:38:25,740
You, on the other hand

757
00:38:25,784 --> 00:38:28,951
seem to have left
your retirement far behind

758
00:38:28,991 --> 00:38:32,727
unless you're simply
on a pleasure cruise

759
00:38:32,766 --> 00:38:35,534
with your pointed-eared friends.

760
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:38,940
Cunning, isn't he?

761
00:38:38,982 --> 00:38:42,514
He makes a racial slur
within earshot of two Romulans

762
00:38:42,557 --> 00:38:45,724
putting me in the position
of either defending them

763
00:38:45,765 --> 00:38:48,100
thus, giving away
my allegiance to them

764
00:38:48,137 --> 00:38:50,735
or letting the comment pass...
in which case

765
00:38:50,777 --> 00:38:53,909
he's managed to plant a seed
of discord between us.

766
00:38:53,951 --> 00:38:56,252
Frankly, I don't find
any of this interesting.

767
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:57,657
You both go to such lengths

768
00:38:57,693 --> 00:38:59,561
to hide the true meaning
of your words

769
00:38:59,598 --> 00:39:00,931
you end up saying nothing.

770
00:39:00,968 --> 00:39:03,964
I think you'll find
when I have something to say

771
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,411
you won't have any trouble
understanding it.

772
00:39:09,321 --> 00:39:11,018
To answer your question,
Garak

773
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:12,962
no, I'm not
on a pleasure cruise.

774
00:39:12,997 --> 00:39:15,195
This ship is part of a fleet

775
00:39:15,236 --> 00:39:17,936
of Romulan
and Cardassian vessels.

776
00:39:17,976 --> 00:39:20,004
A fleet that will
very soon be traveling

777
00:39:20,046 --> 00:39:22,415
through the wormhole
into the Gamma Quadrant.

778
00:39:22,453 --> 00:39:24,013
I take it you're not

779
00:39:24,056 --> 00:39:26,186
on a mission
of peaceful exploration.

780
00:39:26,228 --> 00:39:27,424
Not exactly.

781
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:30,663
You're going to attack
the Dominion, aren't you?

782
00:39:30,705 --> 00:39:33,303
You're going to stage
a first strike against them

783
00:39:33,345 --> 00:39:35,748
before they can come
into the Alpha Quadrant.

784
00:39:35,784 --> 00:39:38,450
A clear and precise analysis.

785
00:39:38,524 --> 00:39:42,295
Commander Sisko must find you
a valuable advisor.

786
00:39:42,334 --> 00:39:43,894
A daring plan.

787
00:39:43,937 --> 00:39:47,434
I didn't think there was anyone
in the Central Command

788
00:39:47,479 --> 00:39:49,814
bold enough
to take on the Dominion.

789
00:39:49,851 --> 00:39:50,505
Who said anything
about the Central Command?

790
00:39:50,505 --> 00:39:52,236
Who said anything
about the Central Command?

791
00:39:52,276 --> 00:39:54,338
This is a joint operation

792
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:57,182
between the Obsidian Order
and the Tal Shiar.

793
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,951
We've been building
a fleet of ships

794
00:39:58,992 --> 00:40:00,723
in the Orias system
for months now.

795
00:40:00,762 --> 00:40:03,894
If you attack the Dominion,
they'll certainly strike back.

796
00:40:03,937 --> 00:40:06,603
You'll be taking Romulus
and Cardassia into war...

797
00:40:06,644 --> 00:40:08,136
a war you may not win.

798
00:40:08,214 --> 00:40:10,082
I don't think
they'll be striking back.

799
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:13,388
Our intention is
to wipe out the Dominion

800
00:40:13,426 --> 00:40:17,231
in one single blow
by eliminating the Founders.

801
00:40:17,268 --> 00:40:20,538
Without them, the Dominion
will collapse.

802
00:40:22,548 --> 00:40:24,883
You seem disturbed
by this, changeling.

803
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,518
Why? After all...

804
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,533
didn't you turn your back
on your people?

805
00:40:30,567 --> 00:40:34,303
You seem to know a great deal
about me and my people.

806
00:40:34,343 --> 00:40:36,644
We know everything you know

807
00:40:36,683 --> 00:40:39,884
including the location
of their homeworld.

808
00:40:39,923 --> 00:40:41,290
Ah!

809
00:40:41,326 --> 00:40:44,322
Starfleet has shared
their intelligence

810
00:40:44,367 --> 00:40:46,999
on the Dominion
with the Romulans.

811
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,845
And the Romulans
have shared it with me.

812
00:40:50,882 --> 00:40:52,044
You'll forgive me

813
00:40:52,086 --> 00:40:54,957
if I reduce the scope
of this conversation

814
00:40:54,992 --> 00:40:56,621
to something
a little more personal.

815
00:40:56,664 --> 00:40:58,931
But why was it
necessary to kill me

816
00:40:58,969 --> 00:41:01,406
and the rest of our
former colleagues

817
00:41:01,441 --> 00:41:03,172
in order to embark

818
00:41:03,213 --> 00:41:05,947
on this excursion
into the Gamma Quadrant?

819
00:41:05,986 --> 00:41:07,717
Because, Garak, I don't plan

820
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:10,753
on going back into retirement
when this is over.

821
00:41:10,797 --> 00:41:13,998
I plan on going back
to my old job and my old life.

822
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:16,339
You were afraid we knew things...

823
00:41:16,377 --> 00:41:18,678
things that could
be used against you

824
00:41:18,716 --> 00:41:22,179
and so you decided
to have us eliminated.

825
00:41:22,224 --> 00:41:26,223
Like I used to say, always
burn your bridges behind you.

826
00:41:26,268 --> 00:41:28,262
You never know who might be
trying to follow.

827
00:41:28,306 --> 00:41:32,942
You always used to say, as well,
that the Tal Shiar was sloppy.

828
00:41:32,983 --> 00:41:36,389
You never should have relied
on them to burn your bridges.

829
00:41:36,425 --> 00:41:37,393
True.

830
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:39,422
They never should have hired
the Flaxian

831
00:41:39,465 --> 00:41:40,524
to blow up your shop.

832
00:41:40,569 --> 00:41:44,010
Actually, I blew up my shop.

833
00:41:44,044 --> 00:41:45,844
It was a way
of piquing the interest

834
00:41:45,881 --> 00:41:48,615
of the good Constable here.

835
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:53,862
You blew up your own shop?

836
00:41:53,901 --> 00:41:57,342
You, my friend,
are a true original.

837
00:41:57,375 --> 00:41:59,710
If you hadn't betrayed me

838
00:41:59,748 --> 00:42:01,411
things would have been
very different.

839
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:04,858
I never betrayed you!

840
00:42:04,894 --> 00:42:10,032
At least, not in my heart.

841
00:42:10,072 --> 00:42:12,601
Why do you think I'm here?

842
00:42:12,646 --> 00:42:14,480
I came because I thought

843
00:42:14,516 --> 00:42:17,353
the Romulans were
trying to kill you.

844
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:22,164
I came here to save you.

845
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:28,379
I never thought I'd hear
myself say this, Garak...

846
00:42:30,054 --> 00:42:32,048
but I believe you.

847
00:42:34,431 --> 00:42:35,866
You can go.

848
00:42:35,901 --> 00:42:37,302
Excuse me?

849
00:42:37,338 --> 00:42:39,172
The changeling, of course,
will have to stay

850
00:42:39,209 --> 00:42:40,542
but you're free to go.

851
00:42:40,579 --> 00:42:43,575
Your runabout is
in Launching Bay 3.

852
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:44,713
Just like that?

853
00:42:44,756 --> 00:42:46,487
Just like that.

854
00:42:46,526 --> 00:42:48,554
Aren't you concerned
that I might warn

855
00:42:48,598 --> 00:42:51,230
the Central Command
and Starfleet of your plans?

856
00:42:51,271 --> 00:42:52,399
It's too late.

857
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,174
Central Command will have
a war on its hands

858
00:42:55,214 --> 00:42:57,014
whether it wants one or not.

859
00:42:57,052 --> 00:43:01,085
And as for Starfleet,
this isn't their fight.

860
00:43:01,129 --> 00:43:02,621
They won't interfere.

861
00:43:02,665 --> 00:43:04,396
It's a trick, Garak.

862
00:43:04,436 --> 00:43:08,309
After all this, he won't
let you just walk away.

863
00:43:08,346 --> 00:43:12,185
It's not a trick, it's a choice.

864
00:43:12,221 --> 00:43:16,094
You can walk out
that door or join me.

865
00:43:16,131 --> 00:43:18,329
Join you?

866
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:20,671
That is what you've been
waiting for, isn't it?

867
00:43:20,708 --> 00:43:22,337
To end your exile?

868
00:43:22,379 --> 00:43:24,509
To come back into the fold?

869
00:43:24,551 --> 00:43:30,795
I'm asking you to serve
Cardassia again, by my side.

870
00:43:32,604 --> 00:43:35,840
You'll pardon me if I appear
a little startled

871
00:43:35,878 --> 00:43:39,478
but are you saying
that all is forgiven?

872
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,792
I can't forgive what you did,
but I can try to forget...

873
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:47,566
to put it aside
as if it never happened.

874
00:43:47,607 --> 00:43:54,317
So, do you want to go back
to your shop and hem pants

875
00:43:54,356 --> 00:43:58,628
or shall we pick up
where we left off?

876
00:43:58,666 --> 00:44:02,402
Garak, this is the man
who put you into exile.

877
00:44:02,441 --> 00:44:04,275
This is the man
who just two days ago

878
00:44:04,313 --> 00:44:06,147
tried to have you killed.

879
00:44:06,184 --> 00:44:08,713
Yes, he is...

880
00:44:10,093 --> 00:44:12,622
but it doesn't matter.

881
00:44:14,939 --> 00:44:16,967
I am back.
