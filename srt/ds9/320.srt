1
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:09,384
I'm sorry, Doctor.
I just don't see the value
of this man's work.

2
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:12,638
But, Garak, Shakespeare
is one of the giants
of human literature.

3
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:16,600
<i>I</i> knew Brutus was
going to kill Caesar
in the first act.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,101
But Caesar didn't
figure it out

5
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,603
until the knife
was in his back.

6
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:21,814
But that's what
makes it a tragedy.

7
00:00:21,814 --> 00:00:24,399
Caesar couldn't conceive
that his best friend
would plot to kill him.

8
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,735
"Tragedy" is not
the word I'd use.

9
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,320
"Farce" would be
more appropriate.

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,155
No, no,
supposedly this man

11
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,324
is supposed to be a leader
of a great empire,

12
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:34,409
a brilliant
military tactician,

13
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:37,746
and yet he can't see
what's going on
under his own nose.

14
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:41,124
Hmm.
Doctor, are you in a hurry?

15
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,502
I have to get to the Infirmary.
I've got a lot of work
to do this afternoon.

16
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:45,337
Oh, you're fortunate.
I have more time

17
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:47,506
on my hands than I
know what to do with.

18
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:49,341
Maybe you could
finish those trousers
I dropped off last week.

19
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:52,093
Uh, tomorrow.
Tomorrow.

20
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:54,262
You're going to give
yourself indigestion.

21
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:56,348
I only have you
to thank for that.
If you hadn't been so late,

22
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:58,266
I could have enjoyed
my lunch.

23
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:00,477
This isn't the first time
I've seen you rush
through a meal.

24
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:03,605
You never take the time
to savor your food.

25
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,273
It seems to be
a human characteristic.

26
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:08,694
Look over there.
That Talarian

27
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:10,612
is barely halfway
through his meal,

28
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:13,156
but his human companion's
plate is empty.

29
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,116
Well maybe he and I
can have dessert

30
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:17,494
while you and the Talarian
while away the afternoon.

31
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:21,665
But it is a very interesting
sociological phenomenon,
don't you think?

32
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:25,335
For generations now,
humankind has had
more than enough food,

33
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:28,547
and yet, you go about your
eating as if you were afraid

34
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:31,717
someone was going to come along
and snatch away your plate.

35
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:36,095
Garak, why don't you eat
for a while and let me talk?

36
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:38,891
Fear of starvation amid plenty.

37
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:43,771
It points to some dark secret
hidden in the human soul,

38
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,898
a gnawing
hunger.

39
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:48,943
Perhaps someone
should do a study.

40
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:53,030
Why don't you?
You appear to have plenty
of time on your hands.

41
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:57,076
Doctor, if you want
to have your dessert,
please, go ahead.

42
00:01:57,076 --> 00:02:00,955
I won't be offended.
I have to go,

43
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:02,623
and I'm sorry to leave
while you're still eating.

44
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,541
No, no, I'm
done as well.

45
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,167
But you've hardly
touched your plate.

46
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,087
If you really must know,
I've been nibbling

47
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:10,130
on Delavian chocolates
all morning.

48
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,840
Where did you get
Delavian chocolates?

49
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,759
Well, I promised my
supplier I wouldn't tell,

50
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,719
but since I deprived
you of your dessert,

51
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:18,179
I'd be more than happy to
bring some by the Infirmary

52
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,556
later this afternoon.

53
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:20,933
Why, thank you.
I'd like that.

54
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:22,101
Until then, Doctor?

55
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:23,685
KIRA:
Uh, Julian.

56
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:24,937
Major.

57
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:26,438
Garak.

58
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,690
About those atmospheric
specifications

59
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,943
you requested for
the Yalosian Ambassador...

60
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:33,528
60 percent nitrogen,
10 percent benzene,

61
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,864
and the rest hydrogen
fluoride, as I recall.

62
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,617
Well we ran a test in one
of the guest quarters.

63
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:41,536
The mixture is so corrosive
it dissolved the carpet.

64
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,622
Well, don't look at me.
It's what they breathe.

65
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:46,083
Oh, then I guess we'll just
have to rip out the carpets.

66
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:50,045
Be sure not to replace them
with anything red or orange.
Why not?

67
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:52,131
They don't see that part
of the color spectrum.

68
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:55,216
Is there anything else
I should know about
the Yalosians?

69
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,844
As a matter
of fact...

70
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,386
(<i> explosion</i> )

71
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,888
Bashir to Infirmary.

72
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,057
Medical emergency
on the Promenade.

73
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,935
It's Garak's shop.

74
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,022
(<i> people yelling</i> )

75
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,993
Oh...

76
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:29,208
Are you all right?

77
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,963
As well as can be expected.

78
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:39,636
But I'm afraid your pants won't
be ready tomorrow after all.

79
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,725
(<i> sighing</i> ):
Report.

80
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,811
The explosion was caused

81
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,772
by a rupture in the power
conduit behind that wall.

82
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,483
What caused the rupture?

83
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,944
Well, probably an overload
in the ODN juncture.

84
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,403
(<i> chuckles</i> )

85
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,947
I take it
you don't agree.

86
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,907
Well, let's just
say, I find it odd

87
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,576
that a conduit running
behind Garak's shop

88
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,578
should just happen
to overload.

89
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,706
SISKO:
So you think someone
ruptured it deliberately?

90
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,249
I wouldn't be
surprised.

91
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:15,917
It stands to reason
that a man

92
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,419
with Garak's past
would have enemies.

93
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,421
I'm detecting traces
of nitrilin.

94
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,841
Nitrilin is
extremely unstable.

95
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,467
And very rare.

96
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:27,054
It couldn't have come
from the power conduit.

97
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:30,724
This could be
the residue from a
micro-explosive device

98
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,517
planted on
the conduit

99
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:35,229
and rigged to
cause a rupture.

100
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,731
Making the explosion
look like an accident.

101
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,066
Exactly.

102
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,441
Hmm.

103
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,194
Sisko to Ops.

104
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:43,778
KIRA:
Go ahead, Commander.

105
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,446
Delay the departure
of all vessels

106
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:46,614
until further notice.

107
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,407
I have reason to believe

108
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:51,578
that someone may have tried
to kill Mr. Garak.

109
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:00,670
Who would want to kill me,
a simple tailor?

110
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,923
ODO:
A simple tailor.

111
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:05,175
A simple tailor who
used to be an agent

112
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,261
of the Obsidian
Order.

113
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:09,930
The Obsidian Order.
Constable, you shouldn't
put too much stock

114
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,350
in the good doctor's
flights of fancy.

115
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,770
Now, are you sure this explosion
wasn't an accident?

116
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,398
Because I can't think
of anyone who would
wish me harm.

117
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:21,316
Someone tried to
kill you, Garak.

118
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:24,694
Whoever it was
may try again,
so if I were you,

119
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,613
I would give this matter
some serious thought.

120
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,740
Well, let me see.

121
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,702
I mean, there's the Nausicaan
whose wedding suit I misplaced,

122
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,871
and the Yridian I owe money to,

123
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:38,250
and, of course,
there's always Major Kira.

124
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,544
This is serious, Garak.
I'm being serious.

125
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,255
I don't think she likes me.

126
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:45,799
She doesn't, but if
she wanted you dead,

127
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,427
you would be.
You do have a point.

128
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:50,971
Could this attempt
on your life have
anything to do

129
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,223
with the reason
you were exiled
from Cardassia?

130
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,558
Oh, I seriously doubt
the Finance Ministry

131
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,353
would try to have me killed
for failure to pay my taxes.

132
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:03,358
You expect us to believe
that's the reason
you were exiled?

133
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:06,445
Do you think I would lie
about a thing like that?

134
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:08,113
It's not something I'm proud of.

135
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,157
I don't like
explosions

136
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,451
going off on my
station, Garak.

137
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:14,161
Innocent people
could have been hurt.

138
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:16,246
You could have
been killed.

139
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,248
Now, if there's
anything you know
you're not telling us,

140
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:19,749
I suggest you
start talking.

141
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:23,670
I've told you everything
I can think of.

142
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,006
(<i> sighs</i> )

143
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,757
All right, then.

144
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:31,428
I'll investigate the "leads"
you've given us.

145
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:34,181
If there's anyone else
you think I should talk to,
let me know.

146
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,932
I certainly will.

147
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,767
SISKO: We've assigned
a security detail to you.

148
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,770
I suggest you stay
as close to them
as possible.

149
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,695
Ah.

150
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,780
Someone should
do a study.

151
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,324
A study?

152
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:54,159
To try and figure out
why some people

153
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,037
can't bring themselves
to trust anyone,

154
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,580
even if it's in their
own best interest.

155
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,791
Why is it no one
ever believes me,

156
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,503
even when I'm
telling the truth?

157
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:08,798
Have you ever heard
the story about the boy
who cried wolf?

158
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,467
No.

159
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:13,220
It's a children's story
about a young shepherd boy

160
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,555
who gets lonely
while tending his flock,

161
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,640
so he cries out
to the villagers

162
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,851
that a wolf is
attacking the sheep.

163
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:23,480
The people come running
but, of course,
there's no wolf.

164
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,692
He claims that it's run away
and the villagers praise him
for his vigilance.

165
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,569
Clever lad.

166
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,822
Charming story.

167
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,949
I'm not finished.

168
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,618
The next day,
the boy does it again,

169
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,204
and the next, too,

170
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,415
and on the fourth day,
a wolf really comes.

171
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,708
The boy cries out
at the top of his lungs,

172
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,668
but the villagers
ignore him,

173
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,338
and the boy and his flock
are gobbled up.

174
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:51,883
Well, that's a little
graphic for children,
wouldn't you say?

175
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:56,555
But the point is,
if you lie all the time,

176
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:59,349
nobody's going
to believe you,

177
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,518
even when you're
telling the truth.

178
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:05,105
Are you sure that's
the point, Doctor?

179
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:08,316
Of course.
What else could it be?

180
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:11,361
That you should never
tell the same lie twice.

181
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,048
You wanted to see me?

182
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,426
I have bad news for you.

183
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:37,220
Major Kira has
an airtight alibi.

184
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,349
I thought you might
want to look over
the passenger manifests

185
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,477
of ships that recently
came to the station.

186
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:47,147
To see if I recognize anyone
who might wish me harm?

187
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,940
Exactly.

188
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:53,153
I suggest you start with
the most recent arrivals

189
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,779
and work your
way backwards.

190
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,369
Well, don't worry about me,
Constable.

191
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,079
I can manage on my own.

192
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,291
I'm not about to leave you
alone in here

193
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,543
so you can look through
my security files.

194
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:11,379
What makes you think
I haven't already
looked through them?

195
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,467
I'm joking, of course.

196
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,052
Of course.

197
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:26,436
No, I'm afraid I don't
recognize any of these names.

198
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:29,272
The bomb could have
been planted days ago
or even weeks.

199
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,858
I suggest you
keep going back
just to be sure.

200
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,068
Oh, well, this
could take forever.

201
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,737
I should think
you'd have plenty
of time on your hands

202
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:39,698
now that your shop
is no longer open
for business.

203
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:41,368
Hmm.
(<i> door opens</i> )

204
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,036
Odo, I...

205
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:53,004
I finished running
the bio-molecular scan
you asked me for.

206
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:55,298
I found traces
of living tissue

207
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,758
on the bulkhead
around the blast site.

208
00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:01,012
This looks like
the remains
of a pheromonic sensor.

209
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,972
A what?
It's triggered

210
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:06,351
when a person of a particular
species gets within range.

211
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:11,064
In this case,
a Cardassian. Me.

212
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:17,070
They're known to be favored
by Flaxian assassins,

213
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,988
and it just so happens

214
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,450
a Flaxian came aboard
the station just this morning.

215
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:34,462
So, Mister... Retaya,

216
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:37,298
your papers indicate
that you're a merchant.

217
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:42,303
I deal in fine wares,
mostly fabrics and fragrances.

218
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,264
According to
my information,

219
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,349
you were a suspect
in the murder

220
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:50,228
of Dekora Assan
on Japori II.

221
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,272
I was cleared
on those charges.

222
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,608
It was a case
of mistaken identity.

223
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:57,485
This is your
sample case, I take it.

224
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,737
Yes.

225
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,909
Well, how fortunate.

226
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:08,747
As it happens,
I'm looking for a gift
for a friend.

227
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:10,498
A lady friend?

228
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,125
Exactly.

229
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:16,170
Unfortunately, I don't
have a sense of smell.

230
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:20,550
Perhaps you could describe
this fragrance for me.

231
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:24,304
It has a somewhat...
floral bouquet.

232
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,347
Hmm.

233
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:30,727
We have a Cardassian tailor
here on the station

234
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,228
named Garak.

235
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,854
There was an explosion

236
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:36,815
in his shop
not long after you arrived.

237
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:39,902
I felt the blast.
Was he hurt?

238
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,781
Not seriously.
Hmm?

239
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:47,034
That one is more musky
than the first.

240
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,203
Oh.

241
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:54,167
Tell me, where were you
when the explosion occurred?

242
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:58,296
The Ferengi's bar.
I went there as soon
as I arrived this morning.

243
00:13:58,296 --> 00:13:59,880
Mm-hmm.

244
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,177
Huh?

245
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:10,350
I suppose I would have to
describe that one as... spicy.

246
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,477
Mm... I see.

247
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,646
And how long were you
at Quark's?

248
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:18,024
The rest of the day.
Right up until your Deputy

249
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,360
came and brought me here.

250
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:26,240
So, have you found something
for your lady friend?

251
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,410
Almost.

252
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:34,915
I think she would like
something both floral...

253
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,876
and musky.

254
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:40,880
Perhaps... if we
mixed these two?

255
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,089
Why not?

256
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:46,302
(<i> smelling</i> )

257
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,012
Very nice.

258
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,681
But on the other hand,

259
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:53,393
she's also quite fond
of spicy things.

260
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,311
Maybe we
could add...

261
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,188
a drop of this
as well.

262
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,899
I really don't think
they would go well together.

263
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,526
Let's find out.

264
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:03,862
I really don't think

265
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:06,322
your lady friend
will like the aroma.

266
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,492
Much less the fact
that when these three
fragrances are combined

267
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,536
they produce a gaseous mixture

268
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:14,914
that can trigger a fatal heart
attack when inhaled.

269
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,958
I had no idea.

270
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,086
Then why did you stop me
from mixing them?

271
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:24,924
As I said, I simply
didn't think your friend
would like the aroma.

272
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:29,596
Unless you have
any more questions,

273
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,556
I'd like to go now.

274
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:34,308
I have deliveries to make
on Cardassia.

275
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:37,978
I'll let you know when
you can leave the station.

276
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,542
Everything's set.

277
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:02,462
The transponder
is on board
the Flaxian's ship.

278
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,923
You're sure
he won't find it?
Not a chance.

279
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:07,926
I've hidden it inside
the ship's magneton relay.

280
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:12,263
You'll be able to track him
as long as you stay within
half a light year.

281
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,056
Who do you think he's
going to lead you to?

282
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,768
If I knew that, I wouldn't
have to follow him.

283
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,529
Oh, I was wondering
when you'd get here.

284
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,698
The Flaxian left
two minutes ago.

285
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,159
If we're going to follow him,
we'd better get moving.

286
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,536
What makes you think
I'm going to follow him?

287
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:38,706
I happen to know that
you're too dogged
an investigator

288
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:42,335
to allow the only
witness in this case
to simply disappear.

289
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,839
Oh, congratulations.
Your powers of deduction
are truly astonishing.

290
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:51,051
Now, if you will kindly
disembark, I will get on
with my dogged investigation.

291
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,596
I intend to go with you.

292
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,308
Forgive me...

293
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:58,977
but are you making a joke?

294
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:01,061
Cardassian humor escapes me.

295
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,940
I'm quite serious.
Believe me, when someone
tries to kill you,

296
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,817
it's no laughing matter.
Perhaps,

297
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:09,570
but I don't require
your company
on this trip.

298
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,572
My presence could be
most helpful.

299
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:15,034
Especially if the Flaxian
goes into Cardassian space.

300
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,997
I am not interested
in debating your
usefulness to me.

301
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:22,458
I hate to interrupt you,
but the Flaxian is
getting farther away.

302
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,294
Now, I assume you've placed
a tracking device on his ship,

303
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:30,842
but if we don't get started soon
he's going to get out of range.

304
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:41,143
<i>Rio Grande</i> to Ops.
Request permission
to depart.

305
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,396
KIRA:
Permission granted.

306
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:48,192
Trust me, Constable
I can be a most pleasant
traveling companion.

307
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,153
And this promises to be
an interesting trip.

308
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,544
The tracking device
is working perfectly.

309
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:09,463
If I'm reading this correctly--
and I'm no expert--

310
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:13,384
it looks like the Flaxian ship
is about to go into warp.

311
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:27,982
Well... it seems

312
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:32,152
that our "interesting trip"
has just been cut short.

313
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,580
O'BRIEN:
According to our sensor logs,
the Flaxian ship exploded

314
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,540
the moment its warp
drive was engaged.

315
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,125
Was there
malfunction?

316
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,460
Well, that's what
I thought at first.

317
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,878
Then I analyzed

318
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,337
the telemetry from
the transponder

319
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,298
I planted on board
the Flaxian ship.

320
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,176
Just before
the explosion,

321
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,678
there was an
interference pattern

322
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,388
in the transponder's
signal.

323
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,974
This interference
could have been caused

324
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:03,101
by a forced
neutrino inversion.

325
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,686
The Romulans. They use
neutrino inverters

326
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,647
in their explosive
devices.

327
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,608
Why would the Romulans want
to destroy the Flaxian's ship?

328
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:14,695
One possibility
is that the Romulans hired
the Flaxian to kill Garak

329
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,907
and then killed the Flaxian
when he failed in his mission.

330
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:20,367
Do you have any evidence
to support that?

331
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:24,497
It's only a supposition,
but it fits the available facts.

332
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,499
All right, Mr. Garak.

333
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,960
Do you know why
the Romulans might hire
someone to kill you?

334
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,544
I have
no idea.

335
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,672
I'm getting tired of
hearing you say that.

336
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,256
How long do you expect us
to believe...

337
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,134
ODO:
He's telling
the truth, Commander.

338
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:38,218
He doesn't know why the Romulans
would try to kill him.

339
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,304
SISKO:
What makes
you so sure?

340
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:43,516
Because if he did know,
he'd already be spinning out

341
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:46,226
an elaborate web of lies
to cover up the truth.

342
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:50,481
Well, the truth
is usually just an excuse
for lack of imagination.

343
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,274
ODO:
Is it?

344
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:55,402
If you want to know what
the Romulans have against me,

345
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,030
you'll have to ask them.

346
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,823
I intend to,

347
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:01,575
but I don't expect them
to be entirely forthcoming.

348
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,122
Yes, we destroyed
the Flaxian's ship.

349
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,790
I have to say I'm
a little surprised

350
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,500
to hear you
admit it so easily.

351
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,752
Why would we hide it?
Retaya was wanted

352
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,921
for crimes against
the Romulan Empire.

353
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,049
His execution
was perfectly legal.

354
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:20,469
We have information
that he may have worked
as an assassin.

355
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,680
I have nothing
to corroborate that,

356
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,473
though it wouldn't surprise me.

357
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,225
SISKO:
Well, shortly after
he arrived here,

358
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,019
someone tried to
kill a Cardassian

359
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,562
who lives aboard
this station.

360
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:32,940
That would be Mr. Garak...

361
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,817
a cobbler, I believe.

362
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:37,195
A tailor, actually.

363
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:39,613
I'll correct our records.

364
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,158
That is, if he's still alive.

365
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:43,534
He is.

366
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:47,663
Well.
Is there anything else?

367
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,207
ODO:
One more thing.

368
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:51,584
How long had
the Tal Shiar

369
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,502
been looking
for Retaya?

370
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,755
Nearly a year. Why?

371
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:59,759
Isn't it curious
that you finally
caught up with him here

372
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,511
just hours after he attempted
to kill Mr. Garak?

373
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,681
We're just grateful
to have found him at all.

374
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:09,435
Now, if you're finished,
Commander,

375
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,395
I have other matters
to attend to.

376
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:16,150
Hmm!
I take it you don't
believe her either?

377
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,819
No.
But the question
still remains.

378
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,030
Why would the Romulans
want to have Garak killed?

379
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,032
I don't know.

380
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:25,409
Considering those uniforms
of theirs, you'd think

381
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:28,704
they'd appreciate
a decent tailor.

382
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:32,041
So, where does this leave
your investigation?

383
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:36,545
At a standstill.
We don't know that the
Romulans hired the Flaxian.

384
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:40,382
We don't even know
that it was Retaya
who tried to kill Garak.

385
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:43,844
All we do know is
that a bomb went off
in Garak's shop.

386
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,596
All right...

387
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:47,431
then let's start with him.

388
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,976
What do we know about Garak?

389
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:51,769
He was exiled
from Cardassia,

390
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:53,729
for what reason,
we're not sure.

391
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,481
He never leaves the station.

392
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:58,151
He avoids contact
with other Cardassians.

393
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:02,655
And it's possible that he was
once an intelligence agent
of the Obsidian Order.

394
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:05,116
A very strong
possibility, Commander.

395
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:08,702
Agreed. So we can assume
that this attempt on his life

396
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,204
had something
to do with the Order.

397
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:12,748
Unfortunately, he's
rather uncooperative

398
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:16,085
when it comes to
answering questions
about his past.

399
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:18,420
And the Obsidian Order
is uncooperative

400
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,840
when it comes to
answering questions
about their former agents.

401
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,259
Ordinarily, yes.

402
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,094
What do you mean?

403
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:29,265
I have certain resources
in the Cardassian government.

404
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:34,603
I take it you don't want
to elaborate on that?

405
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:38,149
I'd rather not.

406
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:41,527
But I would like to request
the use of a runabout.

407
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,279
Granted.

408
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:45,198
Thank you, sir.

409
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,652
MALE:
Stop there.

410
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,114
Where are you?

411
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,532
Nearby.

412
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,159
I've changed
my appearance

413
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,952
since last we
saw each other.

414
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:34,080
I don't want
you to see me.

415
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,165
I need some information.

416
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,751
Is this about the tailor shop?

417
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:41,212
Yes.
I didn't do it.

418
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:43,839
I wasn't going
to ask you that.

419
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:47,009
I think the Romulans
tried to kill Garak.

420
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:49,011
Very good, Odo.

421
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:51,097
I see working
for the Bajorans

422
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:54,016
hasn't entirely dulled
your instincts.

423
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:57,519
My question is, "why?"

424
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,647
You'd have to ask
the Romulans.

425
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:03,567
But I do know that
you are investigating

426
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:08,488
a very insignificant piece
of a much larger puzzle.

427
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:10,616
What do you mean?

428
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:12,576
There's been
a great deal of unusual

429
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:15,453
Romulan activity
these past weeks.

430
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:17,706
Cloaked ships believed
to be warbirds

431
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,542
have been detected near
the Cardassian border...

432
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,169
troop movements...

433
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,630
communication
activity...

434
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,343
Sounds like they're
preparing for an invasion.

435
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:31,553
It has occurred to us,

436
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:34,056
and we're ready for it,
if it should happen.

437
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:37,226
But it doesn't make any sense.

438
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:40,813
Does war ever
make sense?

439
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:45,401
Still the wry observer
of humanoid folly.

440
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:49,780
Tell me, do you still do
the Cardassian neck trick?

441
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,700
No, I don't.

442
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,288
Pity. You were
so good at it.

443
00:24:57,288 --> 00:25:01,541
Garak isn't the only former
operative in the Order

444
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:04,378
who had an "unfortunate
incident" yesterday,

445
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:06,088
but he's the luckiest.

446
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:09,175
The other five
didn't survive.

447
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:13,137
Five operatives were
killed yesterday?

448
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:16,182
"Killed"? No.

449
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:19,226
Three died from
"natural causes,"

450
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:22,938
the other two perished
in "accidents."

451
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,149
Quite a coincidence.

452
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:28,568
If you believe in coincidence.

453
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:32,906
I take it you think
the Romulans had something
to do with their deaths?

454
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:37,036
There were certain indications
of their involvement.

455
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:40,331
That still leaves us
with the question, "why?"

456
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:41,665
Here.

457
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:48,546
Those are the names
of the five dead
operatives.

458
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:51,675
I suggest you
show that to Garak,

459
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,345
then ask him
that question.

460
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:56,722
I'll do that.

461
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:59,933
I trust you'll agree
that this information

462
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,019
satisfies
my debt to you.

463
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:03,729
Agreed.

464
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:06,399
However, if you
do learn something

465
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:09,985
from your tailor
and wish to share
it with me,

466
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,654
I would be indebted
to you again.

467
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,908
I'll consider it.

468
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,172
They're all dead?!

469
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:33,175
I take it you're not going
to mourn their passing?

470
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:35,177
Oh, quite the contrary!

471
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:36,970
In fact, if these were
different circumstances,

472
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,432
I'd be celebrating
tonight.

473
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:40,974
So you did know them?

474
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,727
Oh, yes, we were
quite well-acquainted.

475
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:46,188
In the Obsidian Order?
Oh, Constable,

476
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:48,482
we've been down
this road before.
I don't see why...

477
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:50,568
I've had enough
of your dissembling, Garak!

478
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:54,612
I am not Dr. Bashir,
and we are not sparring
amiably over lunch!

479
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:56,907
Now, you dragged me
into this investigation

480
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:58,700
and you are now going
to cooperate with me!

481
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,495
"Dragged you in"?
I don't know what
you're talking...

482
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:04,206
You blew up
your own shop, Garak!

483
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:10,170
Well...
(<i> chuckles</i> )

484
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,465
I don't think
I've ever seen

485
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:15,468
that particular
expression on your face.

486
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:16,969
Is it surprise?

487
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:19,430
Yes, Constable, it is.

488
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:23,725
I'm surprised that
you could come to this
unlikely conclusion.

489
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:28,230
Oh, drop the pretense.
I knew as soon as I spoke
with the Flaxian.

490
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:31,358
Assassins don't like
varying their methods.

491
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:32,818
He planned to poison you.

492
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:35,362
I think you spotted
him on the station

493
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,030
and then blew up
your own shop

494
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,991
so that I'd begin
an investigation.

495
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,243
That seems like
a very elaborate way

496
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:42,911
to get you involved.

497
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,956
If I needed your help
I could have just asked.

498
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:48,584
But you couldn't be sure
that I'd take you seriously,

499
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,628
or that I'd help you.

500
00:27:50,628 --> 00:27:55,341
Besides, I think
you secretly enjoyed

501
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:57,551
destroying
your own shop.

502
00:27:57,551 --> 00:28:01,388
Well, I admit watching it burn
wasn't exactly tragic.

503
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,307
Whether or not you
want to admit it,

504
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:06,684
you pulled me into this case,
and now you're stuck with me.

505
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:08,686
I want to know
who those men were

506
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:10,688
and what your connection
was to them.

507
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,828
We were all associates
of Enabran Tain.

508
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:30,083
Enabran Tain, the former head
of the Obsidian Order.

509
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,211
He retired some years ago.

510
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,880
He was, I might add,
the only head of the agency

511
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,466
who ever lived
long enough to do so.

512
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:42,846
For some time, we were
his most trusted advisors.

513
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:46,433
Do you have any idea
why the Romulans would
want you all dead?

514
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,768
I don't know...

515
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,729
but Tain might.

516
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:54,567
That is, unless he
suffered an "unfortunate
accident" as well.

517
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:58,404
That is a distinct possibility.

518
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:03,200
May I use
your communications system?

519
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,826
By all means.

520
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:19,925
Well, that's
an interesting way
of scrambling a signal.

521
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:23,512
Yes, I thought you
might appreciate it
on an aesthetic level.

522
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:25,305
Ah, here we are.

523
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,942
Mila.

524
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:38,569
(<i> gasps</i> )

525
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:40,112
Elim.

526
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,909
I never thought
I'd see your face again.

527
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:50,205
I need to speak to Tain.
It's urgent.

528
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:53,292
You can't.
He isn't here.

529
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:54,585
Where is he?

530
00:29:54,585 --> 00:29:56,378
I don't know.

531
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:58,338
He left yesterday
in a great hurry.

532
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,299
He wouldn't tell me where...

533
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,676
Maybe he realized
someone was coming
after him.

534
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:04,637
He's in trouble, isn't he?

535
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:06,513
You have to help him, Elim.

536
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:09,182
I know you're still bitter

537
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:12,852
because of what happened
between the two of you, but...

538
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:15,773
you must help him, Elim.

539
00:30:15,773 --> 00:30:19,151
If you speak to him,
tell him to contact me.

540
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:24,615
Promise me...
you'll help him.

541
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:26,950
I promise.

542
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:35,501
I'll need a runabout,
Constable.

543
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:38,462
<i>We'll</i> need a runabout.

544
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:40,339
I'm coming with you.

545
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,972
I hope you know what
you're doing, Garak.
So do I.

546
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,808
Is there anything you need
me to do while you're gone?

547
00:30:50,808 --> 00:30:54,520
Like what?
I don't know-- any
unfinished business?

548
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,897
Actually, Doctor,
there is something.

549
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:59,566
Well, what?

550
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,234
If you go into
my quarters

551
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:03,570
and examine the bulkhead
next to the replicator,

552
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,823
you'll notice
there's a false panel.

553
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:08,074
Behind that panel,
is a compartment

554
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:10,577
containing
an isolinear rod.

555
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:13,413
If I'm not back
within 78 hours,

556
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:16,750
I want you
to take that rod

557
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,794
and eat it.

558
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:20,253
Eat it?

559
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,714
Mm-hmm.

560
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:23,215
You're joking.

561
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:25,634
Yes, Doctor, I am.

562
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:27,636
Very funny.

563
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:29,471
I thought so.

564
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:31,849
But the answer to your question,
Doctor, is "no."

565
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:34,226
There's nothing you can do
for me while I'm away.

566
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:36,978
Then these are for you.

567
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:40,065
Delavian chocolates.

568
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:42,108
But these were meant for you.

569
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:45,362
I know-- I thought
you might need them
more than I do.

570
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:46,822
Thank you.

571
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:49,908
Good luck.
Hmm.

572
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,840
We've cleared the station.
Now if you'll be kind enough

573
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,009
to let me know where we're
going, I'll set a course.

574
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:10,011
Head for the
Cardassian border.

575
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:12,848
We're going to the third planet
of the Unefra system.

576
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,850
How do you know that's
where Tain has gone?

577
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,351
I don't, but he has
a safe house there

578
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,270
that no one's supposed
to know about--

579
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,606
especially me.

580
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:24,943
That woman, Mila...
who is she?

581
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:29,823
She's been Tain's housekeeper
and confidant for over 30 years.

582
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:34,244
She seemed almost fond of you.

583
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:36,663
(<i> chuckles</i> )
Is it so hard to believe

584
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,749
that there's one person
in this galaxy

585
00:32:38,749 --> 00:32:41,293
who could regard me
with a certain affection?

586
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:42,961
Well, I could believe
there's<i> one,</i>

587
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,588
but I wouldn't expect it

588
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:46,590
to be someone who worked
for Enabran Tain.

589
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,383
As I understand it,

590
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:51,553
the two of you didn't part
on the best of terms.

591
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:53,555
You could say that.

592
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:57,643
Tain was directly responsible
for my exile from Cardassia.

593
00:32:57,643 --> 00:33:00,270
Then I don't understand...

594
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,522
Why I would be risking my life
to help him?

595
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,817
Exactly.
Yes...

596
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:07,444
I can see how that
would be puzzling.

597
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:12,031
(<i> exhales deeply</i> )

598
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:15,452
All right...

599
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:17,663
you owe him something.

600
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:20,123
Ha!
A logical deduction.

601
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,584
I see why you're the Constable.

602
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:24,377
But it's more
than that.

603
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:27,005
He means something to you.

604
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,966
Something personal?

605
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:33,136
Ah, now you've just moved
from deduction to supposition.

606
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:35,263
You're not the kind of man
who would go to such lengths

607
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,098
simply to repay a debt.

608
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:41,478
Are you trying to say that
I have no sense of honor?

609
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:44,481
Well, that remains to be seen.

610
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:46,107
Yes.

611
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,776
You wouldn't
risk going

612
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:51,404
into Cardassian space
for just anyone.

613
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,657
It would have to be someone
important to you--

614
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:56,493
someone you
cared about.

615
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:58,244
I think

616
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:00,497
you were more
than Tain's advisor.

617
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:04,793
I think you were his protégé
and he was your mentor.

618
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,713
That is, until he sent you
into exile.

619
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:10,215
And yet,
despite all that,

620
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:13,844
you care enough about him
to risk your life for him.

621
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,723
Or is all that just supposition?

622
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:21,142
Very interesting analysis...

623
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,769
very interesting.

624
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:27,733
Particularly coming from you.

625
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:29,735
Oh?

626
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:38,493
It's been my observation

627
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:42,497
that you always act
from a sense of justice,

628
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:45,458
or at least what<i>  you</i>
consider justice.

629
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,920
There's no feeling
behind what you do--

630
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,089
no emotion beyond
a certain distaste

631
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,927
for loose ends and disorder.

632
00:34:54,927 --> 00:35:00,015
You don't know what it means
to care about someone, do you?

633
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:03,309
People are just
interesting creatures

634
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:06,563
to be studied and analyzed.

635
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:09,983
Is there any point to this?

636
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:13,070
Only that I find it
interesting

637
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:16,281
that you ascribe feelings
and motivations to me

638
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:18,867
that you know
nothing about.

639
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:22,037
Or am I wrong?
Tell me.

640
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:26,792
Is there one person
in this universe
you<i> do</i> care for?

641
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:28,919
One person who's more

642
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:32,338
than just an interesting
puzzle to be solved.

643
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,883
Is there, Odo?

644
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:36,969
Anyone?

645
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:41,347
If there were, I certainly
wouldn't tell you.

646
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:48,313
And that would be
a wise decision.

647
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,788
I'm taking us out of warp.
We're approaching
the Unefra system.

648
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:07,165
(<i> console beeping</i> )
What's that?

649
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:11,503
I'm detecting
a subspace energy surge
directly above us.

650
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:14,131
A vessel of some kind
is de-cloaking.

651
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:22,681
It's a Romulan warbird.

652
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,557
In Cardassian space?

653
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:29,646
They've locked onto us
with a tractor beam.
Take the helm.

654
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:31,606
I'll going to try to send out
a distress signal.

655
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,734
I can't pull away.
The tractor lock is too strong.

656
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:37,195
They're jamming
our transmission.

657
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,322
Do you think you got through?
I don't know.

658
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,700
I'm going to hail them,
see what they want.

659
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:46,955
I think we're about
to find out.

660
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,556
Tain.

661
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:09,519
Ah, Garak, it's good
of you to come.

662
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:13,439
It spares me the trouble
of having to send someone else
to kill you.

663
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:22,407
Come in, come in!

664
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:27,620
It's been
a long time, Elim.

665
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,707
So, you're a tailor now.

666
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:33,168
Is this one of
your creations?

667
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:35,670
A minor example
of my work, yes.

668
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,547
I don't think
I like the neckline.

669
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:39,257
Well, you always did have
a keen sense of fashion,

670
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,634
but you seem
to have let it go

671
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:44,846
along with your
once-trim figure.

672
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:47,724
(<i> chuckles</i> )

673
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:50,060
Constable Odo.

674
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,187
I've always wanted
to meet you.

675
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:54,064
I wish I could
say the same.

676
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:55,815
Oh, come now.

677
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:58,317
Haven't you ever been the
least bit curious about me,

678
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:01,487
about my relationship
with Garak

679
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,322
or our work in
the Obsidian Order?

680
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:05,533
I seldom waste time
speculating

681
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:08,578
about retired spymasters
and their associates.

682
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:12,082
He's good.

683
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:13,666
He hides his true feelings

684
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,752
almost as well
as you do, Elim.

685
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:18,171
He'd have made a good
operative in the old days.

686
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:20,632
I had the same
thought myself.

687
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:23,676
But then, those days
are long gone.

688
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,595
At least,
they are for me.

689
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:28,431
You, on the other hand,

690
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:31,643
seem to have left your
retirement far behind,

691
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:35,396
unless you're simply
on a pleasure cruise

692
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:38,316
with your
pointed-eared friends.

693
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:41,653
Cunning, isn't he?

694
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,238
He makes a racial slur

695
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:45,323
within earshot
of two Romulans,

696
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,367
putting me in the position
of either defending them,

697
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,745
thus giving away
my allegiance to them,

698
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:53,248
or letting the comment pass--
in which case

699
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:56,584
he's managed to plant a seed
of discord between us.

700
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,837
Frankly, I don't find
any of this interesting.

701
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:01,714
You both go to such lengths
to hide the true meaning
of your words,

702
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,549
you end up saying nothing.

703
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:06,678
I think you'll find
when I have something to say

704
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:09,222
you won't have any trouble
understanding it.

705
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:13,643
To answer your question,
Garak,

706
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:15,603
no, I'm not
on a pleasure cruise.

707
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,897
This ship is part
of a fleet

708
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,566
of Romulan and
Cardassian vessels.

709
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:23,069
A fleet that will
very soon be traveling

710
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,738
through the wormhole
into the Gamma Quadrant.

711
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,908
I take it you're not
on a mission of peaceful
exploration.

712
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:30,827
Not exactly.

713
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:33,288
You're going to attack
the Dominion, aren't you?

714
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:35,999
You're going to stage
a first strike against them

715
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:38,376
before they can come
into the Alpha Quadrant.

716
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,129
A clear and precise analysis.

717
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:45,091
Commander Sisko must find you
a valuable advisor.

718
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:47,468
A daring plan.

719
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:50,555
I didn't think there was
anyone in the Central Command

720
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,765
bold enough
to take on the Dominion.

721
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:55,352
Who said anything
about the Central Command?

722
00:39:55,352 --> 00:40:00,106
This is a joint operation
between the Obsidian Order
and the Tal Shiar.

723
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:03,818
We've been building
a fleet of ships in the
Orias system for months now.

724
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:06,696
If you attack the Dominion,
they'll certainly strike back.

725
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:11,243
You'll be taking Romulus
and Cardassia into war--
a war you may not win.

726
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:14,246
I don't think they'll
<i>be</i> striking back.

727
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:16,664
Our intention is
to wipe out the Dominion

728
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:20,335
in one single blow
by eliminating the Founders.

729
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:23,629
Without them,
the Dominion will collapse.

730
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:28,176
You seem disturbed
by this, changeling.

731
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:30,636
Why? After all--

732
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:33,598
didn't you turn your back
on your people?

733
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,308
You seem to know
a great deal

734
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:37,394
about me
and<i> my</i> people.

735
00:40:37,394 --> 00:40:39,812
We know everything
you know,

736
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:43,149
including the location
of their homeworld.

737
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:47,404
Ah! Starfleet has shared
their intelligence

738
00:40:47,404 --> 00:40:50,615
on the Dominion
with the Romulans.

739
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:53,868
And the Romulans
have shared it with me.

740
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:58,081
You'll forgive me
if I reduce the scope
of this conversation

741
00:40:58,081 --> 00:40:59,749
to something
a little more personal.

742
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:01,793
But why was it
necessary to kill me

743
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:04,379
and the rest of our
former colleagues

744
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:09,008
in order to embark on
this excursion into
the Gamma Quadrant?

745
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:11,386
Because, Garak, I don't plan

746
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:13,888
on going back into retirement
when this is over.

747
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:17,267
I plan on going back
to my old job and my old life.

748
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:19,602
You were afraid
we knew things--

749
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,813
things that could
be used against you

750
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:25,317
and so you decided
to have us eliminated.

751
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:29,279
Like I used to say, always
burn your bridges behind you.

752
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:31,448
You never know who might be
trying to follow.

753
00:41:31,448 --> 00:41:33,408
You always used
to say as well

754
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:35,868
that the Tal Shiar
was sloppy.

755
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:39,414
You never should
have relied on them
to burn your bridges.

756
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:43,542
True. They never should
have hired the Flaxian
to blow up your shop.

757
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:47,046
Actually,
<i>I</i> blew up my shop.

758
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,798
It was a way
of piquing the interest

759
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:51,717
of the good
Constable here.

760
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:54,262
(<i> laughing</i> )

761
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:57,515
You blew up your own shop?

762
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,185
You, my friend,
are a true original.

763
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:04,481
If you hadn't betrayed me,
things would have been
very different.

764
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:08,609
I never betrayed you!

765
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:12,989
At least, not in my heart.

766
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:15,574
Why do you think
I'm here?

767
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:20,455
I came because I thought
the Romulans were
trying to kill you.

768
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:25,210
I came here to save you.

769
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:31,049
I never thought I'd hear
myself say this, Garak...

770
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:35,178
but I believe you.

771
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:40,266
You can go.
Excuse me?

772
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:42,018
The changeling, of course,
will have to stay,

773
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:43,811
but you're
free to go.

774
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:46,439
Your runabout is
in Launching Bay 3.

775
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:47,690
Just like that?

776
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,401
Just like that.

777
00:42:49,401 --> 00:42:51,903
Aren't you concerned
that I might warn

778
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:54,322
the Central Command
and Starfleet of your plans?

779
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:58,368
It's too late.
Central Command will
have a war on its hands,

780
00:42:58,368 --> 00:43:00,119
whether it wants one
or not.

781
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:04,207
And as for Starfleet,
this isn't their fight.

782
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:05,542
They won't interfere.

783
00:43:05,542 --> 00:43:07,752
It's a trick, Garak.

784
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:11,130
After all this, he won't
let you just walk away.

785
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:15,134
It's not a trick,
it's a choice.

786
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:19,013
You can walk out
that door or join me.

787
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:21,140
Join you?

788
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,768
TAIN:
That<i> is</i> what you've been
waiting for, isn't it?

789
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:25,353
To end your exile?

790
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:27,355
To come back
into the fold?

791
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:33,736
I'm asking you to serve
Cardassia again, by my side.

792
00:43:35,447 --> 00:43:38,575
You'll pardon me if I
appear a little startled,

793
00:43:38,575 --> 00:43:42,245
but are you saying
that all is forgiven?

794
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:46,874
I can't forgive what you did,
but I can try to forget--

795
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:50,962
to put it aside
as if it never happened.

796
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:57,385
So, do you want to go back
to your shop and hem pants,

797
00:43:57,385 --> 00:44:01,473
or shall we pick up
where we left off?

798
00:44:01,473 --> 00:44:05,435
Garak, this is the man
who put you into exile.

799
00:44:05,435 --> 00:44:08,938
This is the man
who just two days ago
tried to have you killed.

800
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:11,732
Yes, he is...

801
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:15,612
but it doesn't matter.

802
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,907
I am back.
