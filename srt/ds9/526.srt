1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:02,919
ROM: What do you think?

2
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:04,129
LEETA: I don't know.

3
00:00:04,754 --> 00:00:05,797
What do you think?

4
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:08,174
I like it.

5
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:11,386
Don't you?

6
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:14,097
Rom, it's two handkerchiefs
and a loincloth.

7
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:17,058
I suppose we could lose the handkerchiefs.

8
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:22,355
Ferengi tradition or no Ferengi tradition,
I am not going to be naked at my wedding.

9
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,274
Who said anything about naked?

10
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:26,276
You'll still have the loincloth.

11
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:30,071
Please show us something else.

12
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,906
There is nothing else.

13
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,951
I've shown you 153
different wedding dresses,

14
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:38,329
from Tellarite modern
to Risian traditional,

15
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:39,831
and you've hated them all.

16
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:42,917
Well, I like number 38.

17
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,252
Number 38?

18
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:47,255
It had more layers
than a Baduviam tapestry.

19
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:49,924
-It was elegant.
-It was bulky.

20
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,843
I liked 64.

21
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,887
-Sixty-four?
-( exclaims in disgust )

22
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,097
Well, at least they agree on something.

23
00:00:57,307 --> 00:01:00,727
Why don't you just let Garak
design a dress on his own?

24
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:03,605
You know whatever he comes up with
will be beautiful.

25
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:07,942
My dear, I find your blind adoration
both flattering and disturbing.

26
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,569
But she does have a point.

27
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:10,612
QUARK: Leeta!

28
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:13,531
That 15-minute break you asked for
was up an hour ago.

29
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,742
Brother, what do you think of this dress?

30
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,454
I don't want to think about it.

31
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:22,123
All I know is that any marriage

32
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:27,337
where the female is allowed to speak
and wear clothing is doomed to failure.

33
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,341
Your dabo table awaits.

34
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,092
( exclaims angrily )

35
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:35,553
There he is.

36
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,473
Let's talk to him.

37
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,308
Now?

38
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,477
Now, Rom.

39
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,729
Keiko and the kids
will be a lot safer on Earth

40
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,105
than they are here.

41
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,400
They've only been gone two days,
and I miss them already.

42
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:52,570
Still, don't you feel better
knowing they're out of harm's way?

43
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:55,615
I wish I could convince Jake
to visit Earth for a while.

44
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:58,368
Captain. Can we speak to you for a moment?

45
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,661
If you're not too busy.

46
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,329
Oh. Go ahead.

47
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,415
Would you marry me?

48
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:06,960
I mean us.

49
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:11,923
I mean, would you perform
our wedding ceremony?

50
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:15,051
It would be a great honor
to be married by the Emissary.

51
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:19,556
It's not for another two weeks,
so you have plenty of time to get ready.

52
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,475
I guess I'll have to start
brushing up on my Bajoran.

53
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:24,602
Me, too.

54
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,397
-Captain?
-If you'll excuse me?

55
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,448
Maybe they're not coming.

56
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,242
That would be a nice surprise.

57
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:49,335
One thing I'll say for the Dominion...
they're punctual.

58
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,338
That's the fifth convoy
headed for Cardassia

59
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,090
in the last five weeks.

60
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:57,260
I can only imagine how many Jem'Hadar
soldiers are stationed there now.

61
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,428
Too many.

62
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:03,016
I wish they'd just attack
and get it over with.

63
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,852
I have the feeling you're
going to get your wish.

64
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,726
Thanks for the invite, Dad.

65
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:13,563
-I haven't had a home-cooked meal since--
-Since the last time you were here.

66
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,232
{\an8}Sounds about right.

67
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,067
{\an8}So, uh, what's for dinner?

68
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:22,655
{\an8}Ah. Can I get some salsa with that?

69
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:23,656
{\an8}Read the headline.

70
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:28,369
{\an8}"Bajorans Continue Negotiations
with Dominion."

71
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,329
{\an8}Go on.

72
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,499
{\an8}"Station Commander
Opposes Nonaggression Pact."

73
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,584
{\an8}And the byline.

74
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,296
{\an8}"By Jake Sisko."

75
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,593
{\an8}You should have warned me.

76
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,595
{\an8}I was waiting for the right moment.

77
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,514
{\an8}The right moment was before
you published the article.

78
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,100
{\an8}I know. I'm sorry.

79
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,186
{\an8}But aren't you glad I got a job?

80
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,313
{\an8}You mean, this isn't a one-time thing?

81
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:59,609
{\an8}Nope. I'm now an official correspondent
for the Starfleet News Service.

82
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,236
{\an8}Well, what about your novel?

83
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,780
{\an8}I'm not giving up on it,

84
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,157
{\an8}but, this way,
I get to see my work in print.

85
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,285
{\an8}And, apparently, I get to see
everything I say in print, too.

86
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:12,121
{\an8}( scoffs ) You're a public figure, Dad.

87
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,665
{\an8}You're the Captain
of the most important space station

88
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,084
{\an8}in the entire Federation.

89
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,251
{\an8}You're news.

90
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,836
{\an8}Don't remind me.

91
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,095
I guess I can't stop you
from doing your job.

92
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,013
Can I quote you on that?

93
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:33,309
{\an8}( clears throat softly ) I guess not.

94
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,189
{\an8}Yamok sauce.

95
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:40,108
{\an8}Who would bother to smuggle in

96
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:43,444
{\an8}10,000 wrappages
of Cardassian yamok sauce?

97
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,447
{\an8}Oh. Quark.

98
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,990
{\an8}That little worm.

99
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,034
{\an8}He thinks the Cardassians
are going to retake the station.

100
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:53,204
{\an8}He's a Ferengi.
You can't blame him for hedging his bets.

101
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,331
{\an8}But it is a lot of yamok sauce.

102
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:58,000
{\an8}What is a yamok, anyway?

103
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,420
{\an8}What would you like me to do with it?

104
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:04,715
{\an8}Major?

105
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,759
I don't care. You decide.

106
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,428
Dump it.

107
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:11,431
Very good.

108
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,144
{\an8}Would you mind telling me what's going on?

109
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,563
{\an8}-What do you mean?
-You and Odo.

110
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,106
{\an8}You've been avoiding each other for weeks.

111
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,942
{\an8}-Oh, it's a long story.
-Those are the best kind.

112
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,114
( sighing ) Odo has... feelings for me.

113
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:32,034
-What kind of feelings?
-The kind that aren't easy to talk about.

114
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:33,786
Since when?

115
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,997
Since, I don't know-- years.

116
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,874
I just found out about it last month.

117
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,125
That explains a lot.

118
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,794
-It does?
-Not really.

119
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:45,047
It just seemed
like the right thing to say.

120
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:49,469
-I had no idea.
-Neither did I.

121
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,308
60 degrees Celsius--
just the way you like it.

122
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,106
Uh, sir...

123
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,984
is it true what they're saying
about the Romulans?

124
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,944
What do they say?

125
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:10,448
Well, there were some Orion Free Traders
in Quark's last night,

126
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:11,991
and they heard from a Vulcan diplomat

127
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,701
that the Romulans

128
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:16,412
signed a nonaggression pact
with the Dominion.

129
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,956
A lot of rumors float around
at a time like this, Cadet.

130
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,418
Just don't forget
the 190th Rule of Acquisition.

131
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,796
"Hear all, trust nothing."

132
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,132
Good advice, sir.

133
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,518
The Romulans.

134
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,313
Sisko to Dax.

135
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:43,439
<i>Dax here.</i>

136
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,442
Put me through to Starfleet Intelligence.

137
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,653
The Romulans!

138
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,613
I always knew they were without honor!

139
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:51,656
Now they have proven it.

140
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,241
When did they sign the treaty?

141
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,327
Yesterday. They must
be desperate to side with the Dominion.

142
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,995
Technically,
they're not siding with anyone.

143
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,330
It's a nonaggression pact.

144
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,667
Which means if the Dominion attacks,
they just sit by and do nothing.

145
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,795
The Romulans,
the Miradorn, the Tholians...

146
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,633
the Dominion is making impressive inroads
in the Alpha Quadrant.

147
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,385
And the Bajorans are
still talking to them?

148
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:16,430
My people will never sign that treaty
or any other agreement with the Dominion.

149
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:19,517
Meanwhile, more Jem'Hadar ships
come through the wormhole every week.

150
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,060
It must stop.

151
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:22,645
It's going to stop.

152
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,314
I've talked to Starfleet Command.

153
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:29,151
They've agreed that no more Dominion ships
can be allowed into the Alpha Quadrant.

154
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,486
How do we keep them out?

155
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,947
We're going to mine
the entrance to the wormhole.

156
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,867
Prevent the Dominion from bringing
any more reinforcements to Cardassia.

157
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:40,830
If we try to stop those convoys,
it may very well start a war.

158
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,123
Maybe so...

159
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,125
but one thing is certain.

160
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,501
We're losing the peace,

161
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:50,256
which means a war could be our only hope.

162
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,473
What about pulse mines?

163
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,268
We could equip them
with variable geometry detonators.

164
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,561
( sighs ) Not good enough.

165
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,605
Dominion ships can wait
at the mouth of the wormhole

166
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:06,981
and pick them off one by one.

167
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,107
What if we cloaked them?

168
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,860
Cloaking doesn't always work
against the Dominion.

169
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:14,363
Maybe cloaked ships don't,
but I'm thinking much smaller...

170
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,991
each mine no more than a meter across.

171
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,661
Well, mines that small
don't have a lot of power.

172
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,789
It would take dozens of them
to disable a warship.

173
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,418
We'd run out of mines
before they ran out of ships.

174
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,921
Rom! Are you here?

175
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:35,635
"Cloak. Small. Dozens."
I heard every word.

176
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,137
Well, something's wrong.
You haven't touched your food.

177
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,889
It's my stomach.

178
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,391
Ever since Captain Sisko agreed
to officiate at our wedding,

179
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,768
I haven't had much of an appetite.

180
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:46,187
I thought you wanted
Captain Sisko to marry you.

181
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:50,608
I did, but now that he said yes,
it's become so...

182
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,319
real.

183
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,406
I'm going to get married!

184
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,701
Not for another two weeks,
and in the meantime, we have work to do.

185
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,037
But what if Leeta turns out
to be just like Nog's mother?

186
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,789
What if I can't make her happy?

187
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,374
What if this is
the biggest mistake of my life?

188
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,792
-What if--
-Rom!

189
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,298
Self-replication.

190
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,716
That's the only answer.

191
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:17,885
Self-replication?

192
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:21,347
If the mines are going to be small,
we'll need a lot of them,

193
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,391
and we'll need a way
to replace them quickly

194
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:26,143
if the Jem'Hadar try to blast
their way through, and...

195
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,647
Uh-oh. I forgot to request new quarters.

196
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,065
Mine are too small.

197
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,775
Where are Leeta and I going to live?

198
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,193
Rom, I think you're on to something.

199
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,529
I know I am.
I've measured them three times.

200
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,114
There's nowhere to put her prayer mandala.

201
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,408
We could equip each mine
with a replicator unit.

202
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,159
No matter how many
the Jem'Hadar destroyed,

203
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,327
there'd always be more.

204
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,997
We'd program them to swarm detonate...
20 or 30 mines to each ship.

205
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,958
The only problem is you'll have to wait

206
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,627
until the entire mine field
is deployed before you activate it.

207
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:55,631
Otherwise, the proximity sensors
could cause premature detonation.

208
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,592
Where's Leeta going to put
all her clothes?

209
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,095
I don't have enough closet space.

210
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:04,014
-I better go talk to Sisko.
-I'll go draw up some specs.

211
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,767
I've got to go to waste extraction.

212
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,228
What did Starfleet Command say?

213
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,980
How many reinforcements
will they be sending?

214
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,440
KIRA: And how soon will they get here?

215
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,400
We're not getting any reinforcements.

216
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,694
We'll have to make do with what we've got.

217
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,155
What we've got isn't enough.

218
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,031
Sir, as Strategic Operations Officer,

219
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,992
I cannot guarantee
the safety of this station

220
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,493
if the Dominion fleet attacks.

221
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,287
Your concerns are noted, Commander.

222
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,955
What's Starfleet thinking?

223
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,417
They must have given you a reason
for denying your request.

224
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,835
-They did.
-And?

225
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,588
I'm not at liberty to discuss it.

226
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,923
Let's just say

227
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,926
Starfleet's resources
will be needed elsewhere.

228
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,429
What could be more important
than defending this station?

229
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,306
That is not for us to decide.

230
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:47,057
What are our orders, Captain?

231
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,727
Deploy the minefield and prepare
for a Dominion attack.

232
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,437
And when the attack comes?

233
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,189
Then we are to defend the station

234
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,941
until the mines are in position
and the field has been activated.

235
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,777
The <i>Defiant </i>will be unable
to raise shields or cloak

236
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,154
while deploying the mines.

237
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:01,447
She will be an easy target.

238
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,241
Then it's up to DS9 to defend her.

239
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:08,329
If the Dominion wants to stop the <i>Defiant,</i>
they'll have to come through us.

240
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,919
You wanted to see me, Constable?

241
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,338
Major, I'd like your permission

242
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:20,799
to terminate all outgoing
subspace communications.

243
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,427
You really think that's necessary?

244
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,846
This is no time for security leaks.

245
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:30,976
I've prepared a number of false messages
we can transmit at random intervals

246
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:35,147
so there won't be any noticeable drop
in our outgoing subspace traffic.

247
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,649
I'll see what I can do.

248
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,151
I'd appreciate that.

249
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,862
Major...

250
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,157
( sighs )

251
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,955
There's something you ought to know.

252
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:52,998
What's that?

253
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:57,920
I've been thinking about
asking you out to dinner.

254
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,846
I've been expecting something like this.

255
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,640
I could tell.

256
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,352
You've looked a little uncomfortable
around me lately.

257
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,771
Well, you've looked
a little uncomfortable yourself.

258
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,485
Which is why I wanted you to know
I'm not going to do it.

259
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,863
No dinner invitations, no flowers,

260
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:27,408
no attempts at changing the nature
of our relationship.

261
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:31,245
Until the current crisis has passed,
we both need our minds to be clear,

262
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:34,331
to be free of any
unnecessary distractions.

263
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,709
Well, that's probably a good idea.

264
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:41,547
So for now,
all we need to concern ourselves with

265
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,842
is deploying the minefield,
maintaining station security,

266
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,219
and preparing ourselves
for a possible invasion.

267
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,387
Hmm...

268
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,391
Well, I don't know about you...

269
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,269
but I feel more comfortable already.

270
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,439
( sighs )

271
00:14:58,522 --> 00:14:59,899
( chuckles )

272
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:05,821
SISKO: <i>Captain's Log, Stardate 50975.2.</i>

273
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,908
<i>The next Jem'Hadar convoy </i>
<i>is due in five days,</i>

274
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,076
<i>but our efforts to mine the wormhole</i>

275
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,622
<i>have already provoked</i>
<i>a response from the Dominion,</i>

276
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,082
<i>who have sent </i>
<i>their Vorta ambassador, Weyoun,</i>

277
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,626
<i>to speak with me.</i>

278
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,505
What can I do for you, Weyoun?

279
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,633
Captain Sisko...

280
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,886
I'll make this brief.

281
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,096
We know all about the mine field.

282
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,141
I assumed you'd find out sooner or later.

283
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,810
As I see it, you have two choices.

284
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,605
Either you remove the mines,

285
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,775
or we will take this station from you

286
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,527
and remove them ourselves.

287
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,621
I appreciate your directness.

288
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,247
Now, let me be direct with you.

289
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,249
The mines stay.

290
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,126
I will not allow any more

291
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,420
Dominion reinforcements
through the wormhole.

292
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,757
-You will not allow?
-You heard me.

293
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,096
I can see how that might be
your first reaction.

294
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:17,309
But you and I are reasonable men.

295
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,687
And surely, reasonable men can come

296
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,314
to some sort of
mutually acceptable compromise.

297
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:25,150
I didn't think the Dominion
believed in compromise.

298
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,111
( sighs )

299
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:30,864
It saddens me to see how deeply
you misunderstand us.

300
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,324
All the Dominion wants

301
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,868
is to peacefully coexist
with its neighbors.

302
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,329
Then why the continued military buildup?

303
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,582
Why the weekly convoys of ships and troops
from the Gamma Quadrant?

304
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,963
It's the Cardassians.

305
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,631
Don't get me wrong.

306
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,550
I'm pleased to call them allies,

307
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:52,219
but as you know, they've just been through
a terrible war with the Klingons.

308
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:55,973
I'm afraid it's left them
somewhat jittery,

309
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,892
so they're understandably
concerned about ensuring

310
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,644
the sovereignty of their borders.

311
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,771
And since they're now
members of the Dominion,

312
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,983
their concerns have become our concerns.

313
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,568
I would think by now

314
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:10,571
you have more than enough ships
to defend Cardassia.

315
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:13,574
You may think that, and I may think that,
but the Cardassians--

316
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,951
Oh, yes, I know. They're jittery.

317
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,578
You see our dilemma.

318
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,913
I'm beginning to.

319
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:23,792
What if...

320
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:29,548
we agreed to limit our
convoys to cargo ships,

321
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,425
construction units, civilian aid?

322
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:34,470
Things that will help them get
their economy back on its feet.

323
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:39,308
Did you know when we arrived
children were starving on Cardassia Prime?

324
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,268
It was heartbreaking.

325
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,521
I had no idea things were so bad.

326
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,108
The Cardassians are a very proud people.

327
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,779
They don't want to admit to outsiders
how dire the situation really is.

328
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,491
So...

329
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,117
are we agreed?

330
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,786
You remove the mines,

331
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:02,790
and we restrict our convoys
to medical and economic assistance.

332
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,333
That sounds reasonable.

333
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,878
I'd have to discuss it
with Starfleet first, of course.

334
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:11,799
I'm sure they'll do whatever
Benjamin Sisko recommends.

335
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:15,010
For my part,
I'll personally speak to the Founders

336
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,595
to secure our end of the bargain.

337
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,514
What about Gul Dukat?

338
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,974
Ah, he'll be furious...

339
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,726
at first.

340
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:26,355
But we've developed
a fine working relationship,

341
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:30,317
and I'm sure I can help him
to see the wisdom of our decision.

342
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,695
I will leave it in your capable hands.

343
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,656
You won't be disappointed.

344
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,539
This is a momentous day.

345
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,874
You and I have just taken the first step

346
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,461
towards insuring peace
between our peoples.

347
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:00,055
They're going to attack.

348
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,224
-Are you sure?
-I am positive.

349
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,935
The moment I mentioned
that we weren't going to remove the mines,

350
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:06,687
we both knew there'd be war.

351
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,188
Everything else was just words...

352
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,275
a feeble attempt to lull the other side
into a false sense of security.

353
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,610
I didn't buy it,
and I'm sure Weyoun didn't either.

354
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,112
How soon?

355
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:17,281
As soon as they can get
their fleet from Cardassia.

356
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:18,782
I'd say as early as tomorrow.

357
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:23,036
Which means we have to finish
the minefield today.

358
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,496
<i>We need more time.</i>

359
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,789
You don't have it.

360
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:28,750
<i>We'll do the best we can. Dax out.</i>

361
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:32,504
General, take your ship
and patrol the border.

362
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,006
At the first sight
of the Dominion ships...

363
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,716
I will sound the alarm.

364
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,301
Don't engage the enemy.

365
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,052
Get back to the station
as soon as you can.

366
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,345
We're going to need you here.

367
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:43,682
Captain, fighting them at the border
or fighting them here at the station

368
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,934
makes no difference to me.

369
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,146
You don't think
Starfleet could be persuaded

370
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:52,191
to send us a few more ships, say 50?

371
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,818
I'm afraid not, Doctor. We're on our own.

372
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,404
In that case, I'd better go
and get the infirmary ready.

373
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:02,868
Mr. Worf, see to the weapons array
and issue combat assignments.

374
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,244
Aye, sir.

375
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,454
Major.

376
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,332
I'll contact the Bajoran Militia,
see if they can spare a few ships.

377
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,791
Forget the Militia.

378
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,627
I need you to contact
the Council of Ministers.

379
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,253
Tell them I need to meet
with them immediately.

380
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:16,798
As a Starfleet Captain
or as the Emissary of the Prophets?

381
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:17,925
Both.

382
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,092
That'll get their attention.

383
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,594
Remember the nonaggression pact

384
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,512
the Dominion offered Bajor
a few weeks ago?

385
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,681
Yeah, they're still debating it
in the Council of Ministers.

386
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,141
It'll never pass.

387
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,685
It'll pass if the Emissary endorses it.

388
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,356
You want Bajor to sign a treaty
with the Dominion?

389
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,441
Why?

390
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,319
Major, when I came here,

391
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,112
my orders were to protect Bajor

392
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,615
and help your people
rebuild from the Occupation.

393
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:42,824
We've succeeded.

394
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:46,745
And I refuse to see everything
we've accomplished torn down again.

395
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:52,292
The sad truth is, Major,
if there is a war now,

396
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:55,087
the Federation can't guarantee
the safety of Bajor,

397
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,882
which means Bajor must
be kept out of the fighting.

398
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,970
I don't like this
any more than you do, Major,

399
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,931
but it's Bajor's only chance for survival.

400
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,726
SISKO: <i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

401
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,187
<i>Bajor has signed the nonaggression pact</i>
<i>with the Dominion.</i>

402
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,940
<i>All Bajoran personnel have been ordered</i>
<i>to evacuate the station.</i>

403
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,566
<i>As someone once said,</i>

404
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,778
<i>"These are the times </i>
<i>that try men's souls."</i>

405
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,697
ZIYAL: Are you sure you
won't come with me?

406
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,907
GARAK: I don't think I'd be
very welcome on Bajor.

407
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,285
I'm not going to be
very popular there, either.

408
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,869
My dear, you're half-Bajoran.

409
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,038
So at least half of you
is going to be accepted.

410
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:33,959
I'm sure that Major Kira's friends
will take good care of you.

411
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,253
Well, what's going to happen to you?

412
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,505
Oh, well, let me tell you a story.

413
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,215
I once knew a Cardassian,

414
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,593
a dashing, handsome young man
with a promising career.

415
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,721
But one day, through no fault of his own,

416
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:49,141
he found himself exiled and alone
with nowhere to turn.

417
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:51,226
But did he give up?

418
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,686
No.

419
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,856
He struck upon a brilliant plan.

420
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:58,150
Instead of fleeing
for the rest of his life,

421
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,735
he sought shelter

422
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:03,030
in the one place no one
expected him to go...

423
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:07,034
in a stronghold of his
people's most hated enemies.

424
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:10,579
There, surrounded by hostile strangers,
he built a life.

425
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,873
And there, against all odds,

426
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:16,793
against the merciless logic
of the universe itself,

427
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,920
he thrived.

428
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:22,382
By becoming the greatest tailor
in the galaxy.

429
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,968
And the moral of the story, my dear,

430
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:29,890
is to never underestimate
my gift for survival.

431
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:53,705
( speaking native language )

432
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,218
You may kiss the bride.

433
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,433
Congratulations, Father.

434
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,520
Uh... Moogie.

435
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,396
Thank you, Nog.

436
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,318
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I have business to attend to.

437
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:34,788
Well, that was the most pathetic excuse
for a wedding ceremony I've ever seen.

438
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:38,208
No bridal auction, no latinum dances,

439
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,584
and the bride...

440
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,628
the bride was severely overdressed.

441
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:45,632
Nevertheless, you're very happy for us,
aren't you, Brother?

442
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,135
Overjoyed.

443
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:57,435
( sighs )

444
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,856
I give it two months.

445
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,610
Oh, Rom.

446
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,362
No time for that.

447
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:09,322
Nog, are Leeta's bags packed?

448
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,657
They're already on the shuttle.

449
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,868
-You mean we're leaving?
-No.

450
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,327
You're leaving.

451
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,329
First Minister Shakaar was very clear.

452
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:19,541
All Bajorans must leave the station
for their own safety.

453
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:20,750
But what about you?

454
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:23,044
My job is here, with Chief O'Brien.

455
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,671
Then I'm not going either.

456
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,173
You see that, Nog?

457
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:31,011
We've barely finished saying our vows,
and we're already having our first fight.

458
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:33,180
We're really married.

459
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,724
You've got to go, Leeta.

460
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,642
The problems of two newlyweds

461
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:41,354
are but a small thread
in the tapestry of galactic events.

462
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:44,482
You might not understand that today,
or even tomorrow,

463
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,319
but someday you will.

464
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:51,156
So get on that shuttle
and don't look back.

465
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,784
Nog, take your Moogie to the Docking Ring.

466
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,497
Nice speech, Dad.

467
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,670
I thought so.

468
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:12,344
Computer, what's the status
of program Sisko-1-9-7?

469
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:15,138
COMPUTER: <i>All necessary modifications</i>
<i>have been completed.</i>

470
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:18,558
<i>Program Sisko-1-9-7 </i>
<i>ready for implementation</i>

471
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:19,851
<i>on your command.</i>

472
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,770
NOG: <i>Ops to Captain Sisko.</i>

473
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,564
<i>Sir, we're receiving a message</i>
<i>from the Cardassian border.</i>

474
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,149
<i>It's General Martok.</i>

475
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:29,736
On screen.

476
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,321
Aye, sir.

477
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,865
MARTOK: <i>Captain, we just detected</i>

478
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:37,160
<i>a large force of Dominion ships</i>
<i>headed your way.</i>

479
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,829
<i>They should be there within the hou--</i>

480
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,167
Someone is jamming his transmission.

481
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,419
<i>Contact established.</i>

482
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,296
DUKAT: <i>Captain Sisko,</i>

483
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,383
<i>I don't suppose </i>
<i>you would like to surrender</i>

484
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,927
<i>and avoid unnecessary bloodshed.</i>

485
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,847
Absolutely not.

486
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,517
<i>I was hoping you'd say that.</i>

487
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,689
Battle stations.

488
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:14,072
( alarm blaring )

489
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,448
How much longer?

490
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,826
The Dominion fleet
should be in weapons range in 20 minutes.

491
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,244
Are all the Bajorans off the station?

492
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:21,288
NOG: The last transport just left.

493
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:24,708
( sighs ) Let's hope the Dominion honors
the nonaggression pact.

494
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:28,795
Cadet, put me through to the <i>Defiant.</i>

495
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:29,963
Yes, sir.

496
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,214
On screen.

497
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,883
Benjamin, I know what you're going to say,

498
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,677
but we've got at least
another hour of work

499
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,178
before we can activate the minefield.

500
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,264
<i>You don't have an hour, old man.</i>

501
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,683
<i>The Dominion is going to be here</i>
<i>in less than 20 minutes.</i>

502
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,101
<i>You're going to be a sitting duck.</i>

503
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,812
Then I hope you can buy us some more time.

504
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:47,480
Dax out.

505
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:49,566
Dax to O'Brien.

506
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:52,360
I know, I know. Work faster.

507
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,363
JAKE: A medical tricorder, hypospray,
dermal regenerator,

508
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,408
and battlefield trauma kit.

509
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:01,328
Medical tricorder, hypospray
dermal regenerator,

510
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,871
and battlefield trauma kit.

511
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,582
( sighs ) That's everyone.

512
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,375
Now what?

513
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,962
Now we wait...

514
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:14,007
until the casualties start coming in.

515
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,761
Are you sure you're all right?

516
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,763
I'll be fine.

517
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:21,681
Besides, my father
won't let me stay in Ops,

518
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,100
and, uh,
I promised the Federation News Service

519
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,061
a firsthand account of the battle.

520
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,729
You'll get it.

521
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:31,441
Just remember,
Bashir is spelled with an "I."

522
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:43,995
I must say, Constable,
I admire your composure.

523
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,540
You're an island of tranquility
in a sea of chaos.

524
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,376
What I am is useless.

525
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:52,253
My entire staff
has been evacuated to Bajor.

526
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:55,632
I'm not feeling too terribly
useful myself at this moment.

527
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:58,968
But if it'd make you feel any better,
you could always deputize me.

528
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,428
( scoffs )

529
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,139
I'm sure if the Jem'Hadar
board the station,

530
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,058
you'll make yourself useful.

531
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:06,810
It's ironic.

532
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,270
When the Klingons attacked the station,

533
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,606
Gul Dukat and I
were fighting side by side.

534
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:13,566
At one point, he turned his back to me,

535
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:19,364
and I must admit that for a moment,
he made a very tempting target.

536
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:22,033
You'd shoot a man in the back?

537
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:24,452
Well, it's the safest way, isn't it?

538
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,537
But then I thought,

539
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,790
"Well, no, I can't fight
all these Klingons by myself,"

540
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,208
so I let him live.

541
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:32,210
And now you regret it.

542
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:36,089
Ah, my dear Constable,
before this day is over,

543
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:39,926
everyone on this station
is going to regret it.

544
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:41,428
( device whirring )

545
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:43,221
Rom...

546
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:45,265
I've always said you were an idiot,

547
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:47,600
but I never believed it
more than I do at this moment.

548
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,602
Brother, if you want to insult me,
it's going to have to wait till later.

549
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:50,603
I'm busy.

550
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:51,980
Busy doing what?

551
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,274
Preparing perimeter defenses
for the attack.

552
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:58,862
There are dozens of engineers
that could be doing that.

553
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:02,031
Starfleet engineers.

554
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,450
Hu-mans.

555
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,118
( device turns off )

556
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:07,579
You should be on Bajor with your new wife.

557
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:09,205
That's what Leeta said.

558
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,208
Well, she's right. This is not your fight.

559
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,544
It's not your fight either,
but I don't see you leaving.

560
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:17,255
I have to look out for my bar.

561
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,215
And I have to look out for you.

562
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,551
-Me?
-You're my brother.

563
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:24,721
Whatever happens, we belong together.

564
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,935
( device starts up )

565
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,899
Well, like I said, you're an idiot.

566
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,325
NOG: On screen, Captain.

567
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:48,244
General Martok, take a defensive
position near the <i>Defiant.</i>

568
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,914
They have to finish deploying those mines
no matter the cost.

569
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:52,207
<i>And they will.</i>

570
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,959
<i>You have my word on it, Captain.</i>

571
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,047
Mr. Worf, activate the weapons array.

572
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,215
Aye, sir.

573
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,560
Captain, as a Major
in the Bajoran Militia,

574
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,313
I must officially protest
Starfleet's refusal

575
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:17,190
to turn over this station
to my government.

576
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:19,400
-Your protest is duly noted.
-Good.

577
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,694
Now that that's over with...

578
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:24,030
Kira Nerys reporting for duty.

579
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,467
Weapons range in one minute.

580
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:49,556
I've been waiting for this moment
for five years.

581
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:52,725
First, we reclaim Terok Nor,

582
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:55,478
then... on to Bajor.

583
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,146
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

584
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,315
Or must I remind you
the Dominion just signed

585
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,067
a nonaggression pact with Bajor?

586
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,902
The Dominion might have.

587
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,112
I never did.

588
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,615
The Dominion will honor its treaty,

589
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:11,035
and as a member of the Dominion,
you will honor it as well.

590
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:17,375
Where the Dominion leads, I will follow.

591
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:19,502
I never doubted it.

592
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:24,215
Attack wings one through five,
head for the <i>Defiant.</i>

593
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:28,094
Remaining ships, target the station.

594
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,059
We're within weapons range.

595
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,811
Well...

596
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,521
then by all means...

597
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,649
Fire.

598
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,324
Mr. Worf, all weapons fire at will.

599
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:15,391
Enemy ships are closing on the <i>Defiant.</i>

600
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,936
-Mr. Worf.
-Got them.

601
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:27,278
-( console beeping )
-Sir, the station's shields are holding.

602
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,279
Impossible.

603
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:31,532
Federation shields have always proven
useless against our weapons.

604
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:35,912
I've found it wise to never underestimate
the Federation's technical skill

605
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:39,499
or Captain Sisko's resourcefulness.

606
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:41,960
Damar, bring us around for another pass.

607
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,270
Chief, how much longer?

608
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:02,730
O'BRIEN: <i>Just another couple of minutes.</i>

609
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,191
Take us to our final set of coordinates.

610
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:06,401
Helm, set course--

611
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,869
Chief, I'm going to have to take
evasive maneuvers.

612
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:21,040
If you do, you risk setting off
every mine on this ship.

613
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,250
( yells )

614
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,963
And if I don't,
we may not have a ship left!

615
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,308
<i>You may continue your work, Commander.</i>

616
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:42,478
<i>I will handle the Jem'Hadar.</i>

617
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,398
Who says there's never a Klingon around
when you need one?

618
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,775
( chuckling )

619
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,989
Shields at 35%.

620
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,992
They're preparing for another attack.

621
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:59,120
Mr. Worf, make every shot count.

622
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,748
Attack wings and batteries,

623
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:06,252
concentrate your firepower on Section 17
of the Outer Docking Ring.

624
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:09,130
We have to penetrate their shields.

625
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,404
We've lost main power to the shields.

626
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,574
Switching to auxiliary power,
but I do not know how long it will hold.

627
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:38,493
( yelling )

628
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,580
-( beep )
-DAX:<i> </i>Defiant<i> to Captain Sisko.</i>

629
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:43,664
Dax, go ahead.

630
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,333
We've set the last mine.

631
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,502
Activate the field and return
to the station.

632
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:48,920
<i>Yes, sir. Dax out.</i>

633
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:01,390
-Sir, the minefields--
-I have eyes, Damar.

634
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,893
This isn't turning out
quite the way I had planned.

635
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:06,479
It's a minor setback, Weyoun.

636
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:08,106
Once we take the station,

637
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:11,067
we'll be able to dismantle the minefield
without interference.

638
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,361
Let's both hope your
confidence is justified.

639
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:20,827
Damar, signal the reserves
to prepare for a final assault.

640
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,205
The Dominion fleet is regrouping.

641
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,540
( console beeping )

642
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:29,001
And I'm detecting another wave
of enemy ships entering Bajoran space.

643
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,711
What are your orders, Captain?

644
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,839
We've done all we can here.

645
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:36,342
Notify all remaining Starfleet personnel.

646
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,054
We're evacuating the station.

647
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,691
MAN: Report to the staging area.

648
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,195
DAX: Worf!

649
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,697
Jadzia.

650
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,532
You should be on the <i>Defiant.</i>

651
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,576
I heard you're not coming with us,

652
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,077
that you've been assigned
to Martok's ship.

653
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,204
It may be some time
before we see each other again.

654
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,165
Worf, we may never see each other again.

655
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,293
This is war.
We must put aside our personal feelings

656
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,086
and focus on the task at hand.

657
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,131
I've been through my share of wars.
I know what I have to do.

658
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,049
But before you leave,

659
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:20,011
I want you to know
that the answer is "yes."

660
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:22,180
Yes... Yes to what?

661
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,265
Yes, I will marry you.

662
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:27,518
That's what you've wanted
from the beginning, isn't it?

663
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,353
Yes.

664
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,897
Yes, it is.

665
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,650
Then when all of this is over,
we'll get married.

666
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:38,613
And if that doesn't
give you a reason to survive,

667
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,615
I don't know what will.

668
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:59,342
When I first took command of this post,
all I wanted was to be somewhere else...

669
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:01,677
anywhere but here.

670
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,721
But now, five years later,

671
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:07,808
this has become my home,
and you have become my family.

672
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,894
And leaving this station... leaving you...

673
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:13,564
is one of the hardest things
I've ever had to do.

674
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,817
<i>But this war isn't over yet.</i>

675
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:20,529
<i>I want you to know that while we were </i>
<i>keeping the Dominion occupied,</i>

676
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:24,450
<i>a Starfleet-Klingon task force</i>
<i>crossed the border into Cardassia</i>

677
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:27,787
and destroyed the Dominion
shipyards on Torros III.

678
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,455
Your sacrifices...

679
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:32,792
our sacrifices made that victory possible.

680
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:39,799
But no victory can make
this moment any easier for me.

681
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:44,303
And I promise, I will not rest

682
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:47,598
until I stand with you again...

683
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:50,268
here...

684
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,520
in this place where I belong.

685
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,402
Sisko to <i>Defiant.</i>

686
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:00,611
O'BRIEN: <i>Standing by, sir.</i>

687
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:05,199
-One to beam aboard.
<i>-Aye, Captain.</i>

688
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,959
-Are we ready?
-As soon as you give the word, sir.

689
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:16,836
Mr. Garak?

690
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,587
I'd like to come along, if you don't mind.

691
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:21,048
You never know when you
might need a good tailor.

692
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:24,677
And the simple fact is,
I have nowhere else to go.

693
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,970
Welcome aboard.

694
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,221
-( beeping )
<i>-Dax to Sisko.</i>

695
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:30,683
<i>The Dominion fleet</i>
<i>is coming around for another attack.</i>

696
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:33,477
Release docking clamps.
Prepare for departure.

697
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,956
( console beeping )

698
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:55,875
The <i>Defiant's </i>away.

699
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:58,627
Contact the Dominion fleet.

700
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,379
Tell them...

701
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:03,090
the Bajoran government
welcomes them to <i>Deep Space 9.</i>

702
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,303
-( console beeps )
-Message acknowledged.

703
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:08,596
Good.

704
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,682
It's the last message this station
will be sending out for a while.

705
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:12,933
Computer...

706
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,895
initiate program Sisko-1-9-7.

707
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:17,605
COMPUTER: <i>Program initiated.</i>

708
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:37,875
Dukat wanted the station back.
He can have it.

709
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:42,755
I don't want to see a drop of root beer
left in this place.

710
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,715
Break out the kanar.

711
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:47,093
And find me some yamok sauce.

712
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,261
Rom...

713
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:52,431
assistant manager
for policy and clientele.

714
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,974
Reporting for work, Brother.

715
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,893
What, did you think you could
just walk back in here

716
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:57,353
and get your old job back?

717
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:59,897
Actually, I'm a spy...
working for Starfleet.

718
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,857
But don't tell anyone.

719
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,485
( quietly ) The Federation's
more desperate than I thought.

720
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,156
( aloud ) I knew one day
you'd come crawling back to me.

721
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,742
-Now, get to work.
-Yes, Brother!

722
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,628
Jake?

723
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,922
Aren't you supposed to be on the <i>Defiant?</i>

724
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:26,507
I changed my mind.

725
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:29,468
There's a war going on and...

726
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,262
I'm a reporter.

727
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:32,972
This is where I belong.

728
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,979
But you're not safe here.

729
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:45,151
The Dominion knows I'm the Emissary's son.

730
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,318
If they hurt me,

731
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:49,738
they risk alienating their new friends,
the Bajorans.

732
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:52,867
I hope you're right.

733
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:55,828
So do I.

734
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,247
What the hell is Jake thinking?

735
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,291
Do we go back for him?

736
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:02,418
I can't risk the entire crew
for one man...

737
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:04,420
even though he is my son.

738
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:07,673
And whether I like it or not, he is a man,

739
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:10,092
capable of making his own choices.

740
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,806
Maintain current course.

741
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,058
Aye, Captain.

742
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:22,521
We should rendezvous with the Federation
task force in 48 hours.

743
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:23,731
And then what?

744
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:27,193
And then, we make the Dominion sorry
they ever set foot in the Alpha Quadrant.

745
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:30,112
Cadet, you took the words
right out of my mouth.

746
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:50,257
This is a great victory for Cardassia.

747
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,092
And the Dominion.

748
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,303
Over 50 ships lost...

749
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:56,972
our spacedocks on Torros III destroyed.

750
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,058
A victory perhaps, but a costly one.

751
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:01,852
We'll discuss the repercussions later.

752
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:05,439
Right now, I'm going to enjoy this moment.

753
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:11,028
Gentlemen,
on behalf of the Bajoran government--

754
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:13,364
And the Promenade
Merchants' Association...

755
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:16,534
I officially welcome you to <i>Deep Space 9.</i>

756
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:20,788
You mean... <i>Terok Nor,</i> don't you?

757
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:28,295
Founder, we are honored
by your decision to remain with us.

758
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,256
I'm not here as a Founder.

759
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,925
I'm the station's Chief of Security.

760
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,177
Whatever you say.

761
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:39,181
Nevertheless, having a God walk amongst us
is most gratifying.

762
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,016
I agree.

763
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:44,603
You... me...

764
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:46,939
the Major...

765
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:49,275
together again.

766
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,527
It should be most interesting.

767
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:55,948
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'll be in my office.

768
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,252
( static and hissing )

769
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:14,842
It would appear
Captain Sisko was most efficient

770
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,635
in disabling the station.

771
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:18,387
It can be repaired.

772
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:19,722
And it will be.

773
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:22,933
But your first priority
is to dismantle that minefield.

774
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:26,061
Until we can bring in
reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant,

775
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,271
our position here is vulnerable.

776
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:29,481
I'll deal with the minefields.

777
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:42,286
I assume Captain Sisko removed
or destroyed everything of value.

778
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,414
Not everything.

779
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:51,920
What is that?

780
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:55,799
A message... from Sisko.

781
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,509
I don't understand.

782
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:59,094
( chuckles )

783
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:01,013
He's letting me know...

784
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:05,017
He'll be back.
