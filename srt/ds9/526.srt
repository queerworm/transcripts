1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:02,998
What do you think?

2
00:00:03,032 --> 00:00:04,365
I don't know.

3
00:00:04,402 --> 00:00:06,031
What do you think?

4
00:00:07,142 --> 00:00:09,579
I like it.

5
00:00:09,614 --> 00:00:11,379
Don't you?

6
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:14,358
Rom, it's two handkerchiefs
and a loincloth.

7
00:00:14,393 --> 00:00:17,332
I suppose we could lose
the handkerchiefs.

8
00:00:17,366 --> 00:00:20,032
Ferengi tradition
or no Ferengi tradition

9
00:00:20,073 --> 00:00:22,567
I am not going to be
naked at my wedding.

10
00:00:22,613 --> 00:00:24,310
Who said anything about naked?

11
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,753
You'll still have the loincloth.

12
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,561
Please show us something else.

13
00:00:30,598 --> 00:00:31,897
There is nothing else.

14
00:00:31,935 --> 00:00:35,171
I've shown you 153
different wedding dresses

15
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:38,581
from Tellarite modern
to Risian traditional

16
00:00:38,617 --> 00:00:40,109
and you've hated them all.

17
00:00:40,154 --> 00:00:43,127
Well, I like number 38.

18
00:00:43,161 --> 00:00:44,391
Number 38?

19
00:00:44,431 --> 00:00:47,529
It had more layers
than a Baduviam tapestry.

20
00:00:47,573 --> 00:00:49,065
It was elegant.

21
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,204
It was bulky.

22
00:00:50,245 --> 00:00:52,148
I liked 64.

23
00:00:52,183 --> 00:00:54,051
- Sixty-four?
- Eeesh!

24
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:56,218
Well, at least
they agree on something.

25
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:00,931
Why don't you just let Garak
design a dress on his own?

26
00:01:00,971 --> 00:01:03,910
You know whatever he comes
up with will be beautiful.

27
00:01:03,944 --> 00:01:05,915
My dear, I find
your blind adoration

28
00:01:05,949 --> 00:01:08,113
both flattering and disturbing.

29
00:01:08,155 --> 00:01:09,249
But she does have a point.

30
00:01:09,324 --> 00:01:10,953
Leeta?!

31
00:01:10,995 --> 00:01:12,692
That 15-minute break
you asked for

32
00:01:12,733 --> 00:01:13,723
was up an hour ago.

33
00:01:13,768 --> 00:01:16,137
Brother, what do you
think of this dress?

34
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,674
I don't want to think about it.

35
00:01:19,715 --> 00:01:21,948
All I know is
that any marriage

36
00:01:21,988 --> 00:01:24,050
where the female
is allowed to speak

37
00:01:24,093 --> 00:01:27,465
and wear clothing
is doomed to failure.

38
00:01:29,206 --> 00:01:31,700
Your dabo table awaits.

39
00:01:31,744 --> 00:01:33,373
Ooh.

40
00:01:34,718 --> 00:01:35,914
There he is.

41
00:01:37,525 --> 00:01:38,858
Let's talk to him.

42
00:01:38,895 --> 00:01:40,091
Now?

43
00:01:40,131 --> 00:01:42,831
Now, Rom.

44
00:01:42,872 --> 00:01:45,343
Keiko and the kids
will be a lot safer on Earth

45
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,435
than they are here.

46
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,314
They've only been gone
two days

47
00:01:48,351 --> 00:01:49,684
and I miss them already.

48
00:01:49,721 --> 00:01:51,122
Still, don't you feel better

49
00:01:51,157 --> 00:01:52,820
knowing they're
out of harm's way?

50
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:55,733
I wish I could convince Jake
to visit Earth for a while.

51
00:01:55,769 --> 00:01:56,737
Captain.

52
00:01:56,771 --> 00:01:58,674
Can we speak to you
for a moment?

53
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:00,076
If you're not too busy.

54
00:02:00,113 --> 00:02:01,810
Oh. Go ahead.

55
00:02:03,521 --> 00:02:04,649
Would you marry me?

56
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,127
I mean us.

57
00:02:07,163 --> 00:02:12,803
I mean, would you perform
our wedding ceremony?

58
00:02:12,843 --> 00:02:15,178
It would be a great honor
to be married by the Emissary.

59
00:02:15,215 --> 00:02:16,741
It's not
for another two weeks

60
00:02:16,786 --> 00:02:19,987
so you have plenty
of time to get ready.

61
00:02:20,027 --> 00:02:22,932
I guess I'll have to start
brushing up on my Bajoran.

62
00:02:22,968 --> 00:02:25,030
Me, too.

63
00:02:25,073 --> 00:02:26,702
Captain?

64
00:02:26,743 --> 00:02:27,905
If you'll excuse me?

65
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:37,899
Maybe they're not coming.

66
00:02:37,937 --> 00:02:39,965
That would be a nice surprise.

67
00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:48,260
One thing I'll say
for the Dominion...

68
00:02:48,294 --> 00:02:49,661
they're punctual.

69
00:02:49,698 --> 00:02:52,535
That's the fifth convoy
headed for Cardassia

70
00:02:52,571 --> 00:02:54,268
in the last five weeks.

71
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:56,439
I can only imagine
how many Jem'Hadar soldiers

72
00:02:56,481 --> 00:02:57,609
are stationed there now.

73
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,983
Too many.

74
00:03:00,424 --> 00:03:03,158
I wish they'd just attack
and get it over with.

75
00:03:03,197 --> 00:03:06,261
I have the feeling you're
going to get your wish.

76
00:05:06,036 --> 00:05:08,064
Thanks for the invite, Dad.

77
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:10,910
I haven't had
a home-cooked meal since...

78
00:05:10,948 --> 00:05:13,078
Since the last time
you were here.

79
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,523
Sounds about right.

80
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:17,153
So, uh, what's for dinner?

81
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:21,835
Ah. Can I get
some salsa with that?

82
00:05:21,874 --> 00:05:22,968
Read the headline.

83
00:05:24,113 --> 00:05:27,713
"Bajorans Continue Negotiations
with Dominion."

84
00:05:27,755 --> 00:05:28,620
Go on.

85
00:05:29,893 --> 00:05:32,866
"Station Commander
Opposes Nonaggression Pact."

86
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,959
And the byline.

87
00:05:36,075 --> 00:05:37,669
"By Jake Sisko."

88
00:05:40,686 --> 00:05:42,315
You should have warned me.

89
00:05:42,357 --> 00:05:44,921
I was waiting
for the right moment.

90
00:05:44,963 --> 00:05:47,457
The right moment was before
you published the article.

91
00:05:47,502 --> 00:05:48,994
I know.

92
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,508
I'm sorry.

93
00:05:50,543 --> 00:05:52,571
But aren't you glad
I got a job?

94
00:05:52,615 --> 00:05:54,711
You mean, this isn't
a one-time thing?

95
00:05:54,753 --> 00:05:57,224
Nope. I'm now
an official correspondent

96
00:05:57,258 --> 00:05:59,023
for the Starfleet News Service.

97
00:05:59,063 --> 00:06:01,296
Well, what about your novel?

98
00:06:01,335 --> 00:06:02,531
I'm not giving up on it

99
00:06:02,572 --> 00:06:05,545
but, this way,
I get to see my work in print.

100
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:08,711
And, apparently, I get to see
everything I say in print, too.

101
00:06:08,754 --> 00:06:11,021
You're a public figure, Dad.

102
00:06:11,059 --> 00:06:13,496
You're the Captain of the
most important space station

103
00:06:13,531 --> 00:06:15,160
in the entire Federation.

104
00:06:15,202 --> 00:06:16,637
You're news.

105
00:06:16,673 --> 00:06:18,667
Don't remind me.

106
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,527
I guess I can't stop you
from doing your job.

107
00:06:26,562 --> 00:06:28,499
Can I quote you on that?

108
00:06:31,507 --> 00:06:32,806
I guess not.

109
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:37,488
<i>Yamok</i> sauce.

110
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,390
Who would bother to smuggle in

111
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,960
10,000 wrappages
of Cardassian <i>yamok</i> sauce?

112
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:45,907
Oh. Quark.

113
00:06:45,943 --> 00:06:47,105
That little worm.

114
00:06:47,145 --> 00:06:49,514
He thinks the Cardassians
are going to retake the station.

115
00:06:49,551 --> 00:06:50,679
He's a Ferengi.

116
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,520
You can't blame him
for hedging his bets.

117
00:06:52,558 --> 00:06:54,825
But it is a lot of <i>yamok</i> sauce.

118
00:06:54,864 --> 00:06:57,598
What is a <i>yamok,</i> anyway?

119
00:06:58,807 --> 00:07:00,869
What would you like me
to do with it?

120
00:07:02,716 --> 00:07:04,083
Major?

121
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:05,109
I don't care.

122
00:07:05,155 --> 00:07:06,214
You decide.

123
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:08,856
Dump it.

124
00:07:08,898 --> 00:07:10,892
Very good.

125
00:07:13,575 --> 00:07:15,637
Would you mind telling
me what's going on?

126
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,910
What do you mean?

127
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,918
You and Odo.

128
00:07:17,952 --> 00:07:19,421
You've been avoiding
each other for weeks.

129
00:07:19,455 --> 00:07:20,719
Oh, it's a long story.

130
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,285
Those are the best kind.

131
00:07:24,467 --> 00:07:27,634
Odo has... feelings for me.

132
00:07:27,676 --> 00:07:29,704
What kind of feelings?

133
00:07:29,747 --> 00:07:31,581
The kind that aren't easy
to talk about.

134
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,019
Since when?

135
00:07:33,055 --> 00:07:35,356
Since, I don't know...
years.

136
00:07:35,394 --> 00:07:36,954
I just found out about it
last month.

137
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,661
That explains a lot.

138
00:07:38,702 --> 00:07:39,761
It does?

139
00:07:39,805 --> 00:07:41,206
Not really.

140
00:07:41,242 --> 00:07:44,443
It just seemed like
the right thing to say.

141
00:07:45,785 --> 00:07:47,118
I had no idea.

142
00:07:47,155 --> 00:07:49,652
Neither did I.

143
00:07:51,858 --> 00:07:54,490
60 degrees Celsius...
just the way you like it.

144
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,045
Uh, sir...

145
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,178
is it true what they're saying
about the Romulans?

146
00:08:04,221 --> 00:08:06,089
What do they say?

147
00:08:06,192 --> 00:08:08,356
Well, there were
some Orion Free Traders

148
00:08:08,397 --> 00:08:09,559
in Quark's last night

149
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,400
and they heard
from a Vulcan diplomat

150
00:08:11,438 --> 00:08:12,964
that the Romulans

151
00:08:13,008 --> 00:08:15,537
signed a nonaggression pact
with the Dominion.

152
00:08:15,581 --> 00:08:18,110
A lot of rumors float around
at a time like this, Cadet.

153
00:08:18,221 --> 00:08:21,684
Just don't forget
the 190th Rule of Acquisition.

154
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:25,266
"Hear all, trust nothing."

155
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:26,568
Good advice, sir.

156
00:08:35,696 --> 00:08:37,724
The Romulans.

157
00:08:39,739 --> 00:08:41,265
Sisko to Dax.

158
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,609
Dax here.

159
00:08:42,646 --> 00:08:45,813
Put me through
to Starfleet Intelligence.

160
00:08:45,854 --> 00:08:47,757
The Romulans!

161
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:49,888
I always knew
they were without honor!

162
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:50,989
Now they have proven it.

163
00:08:51,032 --> 00:08:52,501
When did they sign the treaty?

164
00:08:52,537 --> 00:08:53,904
- Yesterday.
- They must

165
00:08:53,939 --> 00:08:56,069
be desperate
to side with the Dominion.

166
00:08:56,112 --> 00:08:57,604
Technically,
they're not siding with anyone.

167
00:08:57,649 --> 00:08:58,617
It's a nonaggression pact

168
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:00,280
Which means
if the Dominion attacks

169
00:09:00,321 --> 00:09:01,813
they just sit by
and do nothing.

170
00:09:01,859 --> 00:09:05,129
The Romulans, the Miradorn,
the Tholians...

171
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,433
the Dominion is making
impressive inroads

172
00:09:07,472 --> 00:09:09,807
in the Alpha Quadrant.

173
00:09:09,845 --> 00:09:11,610
And the Bajorans are
still talking to them?

174
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:13,517
My people
will never sign that treaty

175
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,649
or any other agreement
with the Dominion.

176
00:09:15,692 --> 00:09:17,093
Meanwhile, more Jem'Hadar ships

177
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:19,157
come through the wormhole
every week.

178
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,567
It must stop.

179
00:09:20,604 --> 00:09:22,039
It's going to stop.

180
00:09:22,074 --> 00:09:24,568
I've talked
to Starfleet Command.

181
00:09:24,613 --> 00:09:26,584
They've agreed
that no more Dominion ships

182
00:09:26,618 --> 00:09:28,486
can be allowed
into the Alpha Quadrant.

183
00:09:28,523 --> 00:09:30,186
How do we keep them out?

184
00:09:30,226 --> 00:09:32,220
We're going to mine
the entrance to the wormhole.

185
00:09:32,332 --> 00:09:34,132
Prevent the Dominion
from bringing

186
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,198
any more reinforcements
to Cardassia.

187
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:40,206
If we try to stop those convoys,
it may very well start a war.

188
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,446
Maybe so...

189
00:09:41,487 --> 00:09:43,252
but one thing is certain.

190
00:09:43,325 --> 00:09:44,954
We're losing the peace

191
00:09:44,996 --> 00:09:49,702
which means a war
could be our only hope.

192
00:09:56,423 --> 00:09:58,553
What about pulse mines?

193
00:09:58,595 --> 00:09:59,585
We could equip them

194
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,395
with variable
geometry detonators.

195
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:02,768
Not good enough.

196
00:10:02,805 --> 00:10:05,038
Dominion ships can wait
at the mouth of the wormhole

197
00:10:05,077 --> 00:10:06,307
and pick them off one by one.

198
00:10:06,347 --> 00:10:07,441
What if we cloaked them?

199
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:10,820
Cloaking doesn't always work
against the Dominion.

200
00:10:10,857 --> 00:10:12,053
Maybe cloaked ships don't

201
00:10:12,094 --> 00:10:13,654
but I'm thinking much smaller...

202
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:16,329
each mine no more
than a meter across.

203
00:10:16,404 --> 00:10:19,901
Well, mines that small
don't have a lot of power.

204
00:10:19,946 --> 00:10:23,010
It would take dozens of them
to disable a warship.

205
00:10:23,053 --> 00:10:26,926
We'd run out of mines
before they ran out of ships.

206
00:10:26,963 --> 00:10:28,364
Rom!

207
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,337
Are you here?

208
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:33,366
"Cloak. Small. Dozens."

209
00:10:33,412 --> 00:10:34,540
I heard every word.

210
00:10:34,581 --> 00:10:36,175
Well, something's wrong.

211
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,551
You haven't touched your food.

212
00:10:37,588 --> 00:10:38,784
It's my stomach.

213
00:10:38,824 --> 00:10:41,227
Ever since Captain Sisko agreed
to officiate at our wedding

214
00:10:41,264 --> 00:10:42,699
I haven't had
much of an appetite.

215
00:10:42,734 --> 00:10:45,605
I thought you wanted
Captain Sisko to marry you.

216
00:10:45,641 --> 00:10:50,608
I did, but now that he said yes,
it's become so...

217
00:10:50,653 --> 00:10:52,920
real.

218
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,158
I'm going to get married!

219
00:10:56,199 --> 00:10:57,566
Not for another two weeks

220
00:10:57,602 --> 00:11:00,166
and in the meantime,
we have work to do.

221
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:02,373
But what if Leeta turns out
to be just like Nog's mother?

222
00:11:02,414 --> 00:11:03,781
What if I can't make her happy?

223
00:11:03,817 --> 00:11:05,582
What if this is the biggest
mistake of my life?

224
00:11:05,622 --> 00:11:07,285
- What if...
- Rom!

225
00:11:11,202 --> 00:11:13,639
Self-replication.

226
00:11:13,675 --> 00:11:15,167
That's the only answer.

227
00:11:15,212 --> 00:11:17,376
Self-replication?

228
00:11:17,417 --> 00:11:19,684
If the mines are going
to be small

229
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:20,690
we'll need a lot of them

230
00:11:20,725 --> 00:11:22,525
and we'll need a way
to replace them quickly

231
00:11:22,562 --> 00:11:25,330
if the Jem'Hadar try to blast
their way through, and...

232
00:11:25,369 --> 00:11:29,037
Uh-oh. I forgot to request
new quarters.

233
00:11:29,078 --> 00:11:30,103
Mine are too small.

234
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,175
Where are Leeta and I
going to live?

235
00:11:32,219 --> 00:11:33,688
Rom, I think
you're on to something.

236
00:11:33,723 --> 00:11:34,691
I know I am.

237
00:11:34,725 --> 00:11:35,887
I've measured them three times.

238
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,454
There's nowhere to put
her prayer mandala.

239
00:11:37,565 --> 00:11:39,934
We could equip each mine
with a replicator unit.

240
00:11:39,971 --> 00:11:41,463
No matter how many
the Jem'Hadar destroyed

241
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:42,703
there'd always be more.

242
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,441
We'd program them
to swarm detonate...

243
00:11:44,482 --> 00:11:46,316
20 or 30 mines to each ship.

244
00:11:46,353 --> 00:11:47,686
The only problem is

245
00:11:47,722 --> 00:11:49,487
you'll have to wait
until the entire mine field

246
00:11:49,594 --> 00:11:50,961
is deployed
before you activate it.

247
00:11:50,997 --> 00:11:52,797
Otherwise,
the proximity sensors

248
00:11:52,835 --> 00:11:54,965
could cause
premature detonation.

249
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,946
Where's Leeta going to put
all her clothes?

250
00:11:57,981 --> 00:12:00,647
I don't have enough
closet space.

251
00:12:00,688 --> 00:12:01,987
I better go talk to Sisko.

252
00:12:02,023 --> 00:12:03,549
I'll go draw up some specs.

253
00:12:03,594 --> 00:12:05,325
I've got to go
to waste extraction.

254
00:12:06,334 --> 00:12:08,567
What did
Starfleet Command say?

255
00:12:08,606 --> 00:12:10,474
How many reinforcements
will they be sending?

256
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,843
And how soon
will they get here?

257
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,680
We're not getting
any reinforcements.

258
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:15,849
We'll have to make do
with what we've got.

259
00:12:17,026 --> 00:12:18,495
What we've got isn't enough.

260
00:12:18,597 --> 00:12:20,260
Sir, as Strategic
Operations Officer

261
00:12:20,301 --> 00:12:22,397
I cannot guarantee the
safety of this station

262
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:23,840
if the Dominion fleet attacks.

263
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:26,006
Your concerns are noted,
Commander.

264
00:12:26,048 --> 00:12:27,415
What's Starfleet thinking?

265
00:12:27,451 --> 00:12:29,216
They must have given you
a reason

266
00:12:29,255 --> 00:12:30,519
for denying your request.

267
00:12:30,558 --> 00:12:31,526
They did.

268
00:12:31,561 --> 00:12:32,529
And?

269
00:12:32,597 --> 00:12:34,932
I'm not at liberty
to discuss it.

270
00:12:34,969 --> 00:12:36,940
Let's just say

271
00:12:36,974 --> 00:12:40,210
Starfleet's resources
will be needed elsewhere.

272
00:12:40,249 --> 00:12:42,881
What could be more important
than defending this station?

273
00:12:42,922 --> 00:12:44,722
That is not for us to decide.

274
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:46,662
What are our orders, Captain?

275
00:12:46,697 --> 00:12:49,329
Deploy the minefield and prepare
for a Dominion attack.

276
00:12:49,371 --> 00:12:51,399
And when the attack comes?

277
00:12:51,443 --> 00:12:52,742
Then we are to defend
the station

278
00:12:52,778 --> 00:12:54,077
until the mines are in position

279
00:12:54,115 --> 00:12:55,550
and the field
has been activated.

280
00:12:55,585 --> 00:12:58,251
The <i>Defiant</i> will be unable
to raise shields or cloak

281
00:12:58,292 --> 00:12:59,591
while deploying the mines.

282
00:12:59,662 --> 00:13:01,063
She will be an easy target.

283
00:13:01,098 --> 00:13:03,399
Then it's up to DS9
to defend her.

284
00:13:03,437 --> 00:13:05,840
If the Dominion wants
to stop the <i>Defiant</i>

285
00:13:05,877 --> 00:13:08,475
they'll have to come through us.

286
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:14,554
You wanted to see me, Constable?

287
00:13:14,598 --> 00:13:16,899
Major, I'd like your permission

288
00:13:16,936 --> 00:13:20,433
to terminate all outgoing
subspace communications.

289
00:13:20,478 --> 00:13:22,972
You really think
that's necessary?

290
00:13:23,018 --> 00:13:25,319
This is no time
for security leaks.

291
00:13:25,357 --> 00:13:27,851
I've prepared a number
of false messages

292
00:13:27,896 --> 00:13:30,425
we can transmit
at random intervals

293
00:13:30,469 --> 00:13:31,995
so there won't be
any noticeable drop

294
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:34,773
in our outgoing
subspace traffic.

295
00:13:34,812 --> 00:13:36,179
I'll see what I can do.

296
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:38,380
I'd appreciate that.

297
00:13:39,424 --> 00:13:41,953
Major...

298
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,013
there's something
you ought to know.

299
00:13:51,052 --> 00:13:52,544
What's that?

300
00:13:52,589 --> 00:13:58,365
I've been thinking
about asking you out to dinner.

301
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,550
I've been expecting
something like this.

302
00:14:07,591 --> 00:14:09,151
I could tell.

303
00:14:09,195 --> 00:14:11,598
You've looked
a little uncomfortable

304
00:14:11,635 --> 00:14:12,603
around me lately.

305
00:14:12,637 --> 00:14:13,627
Well, you've looked

306
00:14:13,672 --> 00:14:15,403
a little uncomfortable
yourself.

307
00:14:17,715 --> 00:14:19,879
Which is why
I wanted you to know

308
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,514
I'm not going to do it.

309
00:14:21,557 --> 00:14:22,651
No dinner invitations,

310
00:14:22,694 --> 00:14:24,790
no flowers, no attempts
at changing the nature

311
00:14:24,832 --> 00:14:26,996
of our relationship.

312
00:14:27,038 --> 00:14:28,906
Until the current crisis
has passed

313
00:14:28,942 --> 00:14:30,879
we both need our minds
to be clear...

314
00:14:30,914 --> 00:14:34,582
to be free of any
unnecessary distractions.

315
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,222
Well, that's probably
a good idea.

316
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:40,997
So for now, all we need
to concern ourselves with

317
00:14:41,034 --> 00:14:44,132
is deploying the minefield,
maintaining station security

318
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,645
and preparing ourselves
for a possible invasion.

319
00:14:46,681 --> 00:14:48,173
Hmm.

320
00:14:48,217 --> 00:14:51,783
Well, I don't know about you...

321
00:14:51,826 --> 00:14:55,323
but I feel
more comfortable already.

322
00:15:01,248 --> 00:15:05,087
Captain's Log, Stardate 50975.2.

323
00:15:05,124 --> 00:15:08,154
The next Jem'Hadar convoy
is due in five days

324
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,295
but our efforts
to mine the wormhole

325
00:15:10,337 --> 00:15:14,210
have already provoked
a response from the Dominion

326
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,479
who have sent
their Vorta ambassador, Weyoun

327
00:15:16,551 --> 00:15:18,180
to speak with me.

328
00:15:20,361 --> 00:15:22,855
What can I do for you, Weyoun?

329
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,962
Captain Sisko...

330
00:15:25,005 --> 00:15:28,172
I'll make this brief.

331
00:15:28,213 --> 00:15:30,684
We know all about
the mine field.

332
00:15:30,719 --> 00:15:33,521
I assumed you'd find out
sooner or later.

333
00:15:33,626 --> 00:15:35,426
As I see it,
you have two choices.

334
00:15:35,464 --> 00:15:38,961
Either you remove the mines

335
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:42,777
or we will take this station
from you...

336
00:15:42,815 --> 00:15:45,252
and remove them ourselves.

337
00:15:52,505 --> 00:15:54,270
I appreciate your directness.

338
00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:57,214
Now, let me be direct with you.

339
00:15:57,249 --> 00:15:58,843
The mines stay.

340
00:15:58,887 --> 00:16:01,154
I will not allow any more

341
00:16:01,192 --> 00:16:03,060
Dominion reinforcements
through the wormhole.

342
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:04,896
You will not allow?

343
00:16:04,934 --> 00:16:06,563
You heard me.

344
00:16:08,944 --> 00:16:11,974
I can see how that might be
your first reaction.

345
00:16:13,221 --> 00:16:16,662
But you and I
are reasonable men.

346
00:16:16,695 --> 00:16:19,293
And surely, reasonable
men can come

347
00:16:19,335 --> 00:16:22,001
to some sort of mutually
acceptable compromise.

348
00:16:22,042 --> 00:16:24,879
I didn't think the Dominion
believed in compromise.

349
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:30,452
It saddens me to see how
deeply you misunderstand us.

350
00:16:30,496 --> 00:16:31,829
All the Dominion wants

351
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:34,532
is to peacefully coexist
with its neighbors.

352
00:16:34,572 --> 00:16:36,839
Then why the continued
military buildup?

353
00:16:36,878 --> 00:16:38,974
Why the weekly convoys
of ships and troops

354
00:16:39,016 --> 00:16:40,315
from the Gamma Quadrant?

355
00:16:43,327 --> 00:16:45,560
It's the Cardassians.

356
00:16:45,599 --> 00:16:47,467
Don't get me wrong.

357
00:16:47,503 --> 00:16:48,767
I'm pleased
to call them allies

358
00:16:48,806 --> 00:16:50,537
but as you know,
they've just been through

359
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:51,944
a terrible war
with the Klingons.

360
00:16:51,981 --> 00:16:55,581
I'm afraid it's left them
somewhat jittery

361
00:16:55,623 --> 00:16:58,528
so they're understandably
concerned about insuring

362
00:16:58,563 --> 00:17:00,123
the sovereignty
of their borders.

363
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,364
And since they're now
members of the Dominion

364
00:17:02,405 --> 00:17:05,709
their concerns have
become our concerns.

365
00:17:05,747 --> 00:17:07,011
I would think by now

366
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:10,320
you have more than enough ships
to defend Cardassia.

367
00:17:10,357 --> 00:17:12,191
You may think that,
and I may think that

368
00:17:12,229 --> 00:17:13,219
but the Cardassians...

369
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:14,461
Oh, yes, I know.

370
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:15,629
They're jittery.

371
00:17:15,737 --> 00:17:17,297
You see our dilemma.

372
00:17:17,341 --> 00:17:19,710
I'm beginning to.

373
00:17:21,852 --> 00:17:23,823
What if...

374
00:17:23,856 --> 00:17:28,664
we agreed to limit our
convoys to cargo ships

375
00:17:28,768 --> 00:17:31,171
construction units,
civilian aid?

376
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,179
Things that will help
them get their economy

377
00:17:33,212 --> 00:17:34,180
back on its feet.

378
00:17:34,215 --> 00:17:36,277
Did you know when we arrived

379
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,054
children were starving
on Cardassia Prime?

380
00:17:39,094 --> 00:17:41,065
It was heartbreaking.

381
00:17:41,098 --> 00:17:44,299
I had no idea
things were so bad.

382
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:47,711
The Cardassians are
a very proud people.

383
00:17:47,781 --> 00:17:49,478
They don't want
to admit to outsiders

384
00:17:49,518 --> 00:17:51,921
how dire the situation
really is.

385
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:54,522
So...

386
00:17:54,563 --> 00:17:57,092
are we agreed?

387
00:17:57,137 --> 00:17:58,663
You remove the mines

388
00:17:58,707 --> 00:18:01,680
and we restrict our convoys to
medical and economic assistance.

389
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:04,116
That sounds reasonable.

390
00:18:04,154 --> 00:18:07,686
I'd have to discuss it
with Starfleet first, of course.

391
00:18:07,729 --> 00:18:11,500
I'm sure they'll do whatever
Benjamin Sisko recommends.

392
00:18:11,538 --> 00:18:13,975
For my part, I'll personally
speak to the Founders

393
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,539
to secure our end
of the bargain.

394
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,486
What about Gul Dukat?

395
00:18:18,521 --> 00:18:21,153
Ah, he'll be furious...

396
00:18:21,195 --> 00:18:22,664
at first.

397
00:18:22,698 --> 00:18:26,161
But we've developed
a fine working relationship

398
00:18:26,207 --> 00:18:28,736
and I'm sure I can
help him to see the wisdom

399
00:18:28,846 --> 00:18:30,145
of our decision.

400
00:18:30,182 --> 00:18:33,554
I will leave it
in your capable hands.

401
00:18:33,591 --> 00:18:35,562
You won't be disappointed.

402
00:18:41,141 --> 00:18:43,408
This is a momentous day.

403
00:18:43,448 --> 00:18:45,681
You and I have just
taken the first step

404
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,593
towards insuring peace
between our peoples.

405
00:18:57,849 --> 00:18:59,079
They're going to attack.

406
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:00,213
Are you sure?

407
00:19:00,254 --> 00:19:01,883
I am positive.

408
00:19:01,925 --> 00:19:03,019
The moment I mentioned

409
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:04,690
that we weren't going
to remove the mines

410
00:19:04,731 --> 00:19:06,496
we both knew there'd be war.

411
00:19:06,536 --> 00:19:08,028
Everything else
was just words...

412
00:19:08,073 --> 00:19:09,770
a feeble attempt
to lull the other side

413
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,006
into a false sense of security.

414
00:19:11,047 --> 00:19:12,106
I didn't buy it

415
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,619
and I'm sure
Weyoun didn't, either.

416
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:14,712
How soon?

417
00:19:14,755 --> 00:19:16,988
As soon as they can get
their fleet from Cardassia.

418
00:19:17,028 --> 00:19:18,588
I'd say as early as tomorrow.

419
00:19:18,632 --> 00:19:23,007
Which means we have to finish
the minefield today.

420
00:19:23,042 --> 00:19:24,443
We need more time.

421
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:25,607
You don't have it.

422
00:19:25,649 --> 00:19:28,679
We'll do the best we can.
Dax out.

423
00:19:28,723 --> 00:19:32,186
General, take your ship
and patrol the border.

424
00:19:32,231 --> 00:19:33,791
At the first sight
of the Dominion ships...

425
00:19:33,835 --> 00:19:35,566
I will sound the alarm.

426
00:19:35,606 --> 00:19:37,041
Don't engage the enemy.

427
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:38,841
Get back to the station
as soon as you can.

428
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,076
We're going to need you here.

429
00:19:40,117 --> 00:19:42,213
Captain, fighting them
at the border

430
00:19:42,255 --> 00:19:44,556
or fighting them
here at the station

431
00:19:44,594 --> 00:19:46,291
makes no difference to me.

432
00:19:46,332 --> 00:19:48,861
You don't think
Starfleet could be persuaded

433
00:19:48,971 --> 00:19:52,172
to send us a few
more ships, say 50?

434
00:19:52,212 --> 00:19:53,545
I'm afraid not, Doctor.

435
00:19:53,582 --> 00:19:54,778
We're on our own.

436
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,586
In that case, I'd better go
and get the Infirmary ready.

437
00:19:59,263 --> 00:20:01,063
Mr. Worf,
see to the weapons array

438
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,626
and issue combat assignments.

439
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:03,798
Aye, sir.

440
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,036
Major.

441
00:20:05,077 --> 00:20:06,239
I'll contact the Bajoran Militia

442
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:07,578
see if they can
spare a few ships.

443
00:20:07,615 --> 00:20:09,483
Forget the Militia.

444
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,354
I need you to contact
the Council of Ministers.

445
00:20:11,392 --> 00:20:13,260
Tell them I need to meet
with them immediately.

446
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:14,731
As a Starfleet Captain

447
00:20:14,766 --> 00:20:16,703
or as the Emissary
of the Prophets?

448
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:17,796
Both.

449
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,105
That'll get their attention.

450
00:20:19,143 --> 00:20:20,635
Remember the nonaggression pact

451
00:20:20,681 --> 00:20:22,515
the Dominion offered Bajor
a few weeks ago?

452
00:20:22,551 --> 00:20:24,818
Yeah, they're still debating it
in the Council of Ministers.

453
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:25,916
It'll never pass.

454
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,694
It'll pass
if the Emissary endorses it.

455
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:33,233
You want Bajor to sign a treaty
with the Dominion?

456
00:20:33,277 --> 00:20:34,507
Why?

457
00:20:34,547 --> 00:20:36,381
Major, when I came here

458
00:20:36,418 --> 00:20:37,978
my orders were
to protect Bajor

459
00:20:38,022 --> 00:20:41,326
and help your people
rebuild from the Occupation.

460
00:20:41,363 --> 00:20:42,992
We've succeeded.

461
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:44,002
And I refuse to see

462
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:46,269
everything we've accomplished
torn down again.

463
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,153
The sad truth is, Major,
if there is a war now

464
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,992
the Federation can't guarantee
the safety of Bajor

465
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:58,835
which means Bajor must
be kept out of the fighting.

466
00:20:58,872 --> 00:21:02,210
I don't like this
any more than you do, Major

467
00:21:02,247 --> 00:21:06,052
but it's Bajor's
only chance for survival.

468
00:21:07,659 --> 00:21:09,094
Captain's Log, supplemental.

469
00:21:09,129 --> 00:21:11,157
Bajor has signed
the nonaggression pact

470
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:12,260
with the Dominion.

471
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,298
All Bajoran personnel
have been ordered

472
00:21:14,343 --> 00:21:15,607
to evacuate the station.

473
00:21:15,645 --> 00:21:16,773
As someone once said,

474
00:21:16,815 --> 00:21:20,016
"These are the times
that try men's souls."

475
00:21:20,123 --> 00:21:21,683
Are you sure
you won't come with me?

476
00:21:21,727 --> 00:21:23,823
I don't think
I'd be very welcome on Bajor.

477
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:26,132
I'm not going to be
very popular there, either.

478
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,833
My dear, you're half-Bajoran.

479
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,937
So at least half of you
is going to be accepted.

480
00:21:29,979 --> 00:21:32,143
I'm sure that Major
Kira's friends

481
00:21:32,185 --> 00:21:33,882
will take good care of you.

482
00:21:33,922 --> 00:21:36,325
Well, what's going
to happen to you?

483
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:38,525
Oh, well, let me
tell you a story.

484
00:21:38,566 --> 00:21:40,195
I once knew a Cardassian...

485
00:21:40,238 --> 00:21:42,072
a dashing,
handsome young man

486
00:21:42,142 --> 00:21:43,805
with a promising career.

487
00:21:43,846 --> 00:21:45,714
But one day, through
no fault of his own

488
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,880
he found himself
exiled and alone

489
00:21:47,923 --> 00:21:49,256
with nowhere to turn.

490
00:21:49,292 --> 00:21:51,320
But did he give up?

491
00:21:51,364 --> 00:21:52,697
No.

492
00:21:52,734 --> 00:21:55,832
He struck upon
a brilliant plan.

493
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:58,073
Instead of fleeing
for the rest of his life

494
00:21:58,114 --> 00:21:59,708
he sought shelter

495
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:02,489
in the one place no one
expected him to go...

496
00:22:02,622 --> 00:22:06,427
in a stronghold of his
people's most hated enemies.

497
00:22:06,464 --> 00:22:08,958
There, surrounded
by hostile strangers

498
00:22:09,004 --> 00:22:10,234
he built a life.

499
00:22:10,274 --> 00:22:12,336
And there, against all odds

500
00:22:12,379 --> 00:22:16,412
against the merciless logic
of the universe itself

501
00:22:16,455 --> 00:22:18,483
he thrived.

502
00:22:18,527 --> 00:22:21,990
By becoming the greatest
tailor in the galaxy.

503
00:22:22,035 --> 00:22:24,472
And the moral
of the story, my dear

504
00:22:24,508 --> 00:22:29,954
is to never underestimate
my gift for survival.

505
00:22:50,972 --> 00:22:53,205
<i>Boray pree hadokee.</i>

506
00:22:53,244 --> 00:22:55,808
<i>Tolata impara boresh.</i>

507
00:22:55,849 --> 00:22:59,153
<i>Preeya Rom, Preeya Leeta...</i>

508
00:22:59,191 --> 00:23:02,859
<i>abrem varo atel.</i>

509
00:23:04,203 --> 00:23:05,763
You may kiss the bride.

510
00:23:10,752 --> 00:23:12,985
Congratulations, Father.

511
00:23:14,995 --> 00:23:16,555
Uh... Moogie.

512
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,092
Thank you, Nog.

513
00:23:19,807 --> 00:23:20,969
Well, if you'll excuse me

514
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,947
I have business to attend to.

515
00:23:28,128 --> 00:23:31,226
Well, that was
the most pathetic excuse

516
00:23:31,268 --> 00:23:34,264
for a wedding ceremony
I've ever seen.

517
00:23:34,308 --> 00:23:37,179
No bridal auction,
no latinum dances

518
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:38,514
and the bride...

519
00:23:38,552 --> 00:23:41,548
the bride was
severely overdressed.

520
00:23:41,592 --> 00:23:42,788
Nevertheless

521
00:23:42,829 --> 00:23:45,961
you're very happy for us,
aren't you, Brother?

522
00:23:46,004 --> 00:23:48,134
Overjoyed.

523
00:23:58,567 --> 00:24:00,731
I give it two months.

524
00:24:03,044 --> 00:24:05,106
Oh, Rom.

525
00:24:05,149 --> 00:24:06,949
No time for that.

526
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:09,117
Nog, are Leeta's bags packed?

527
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:10,287
They're already on the shuttle.

528
00:24:10,329 --> 00:24:11,297
You mean we're leaving?

529
00:24:11,331 --> 00:24:12,425
No.

530
00:24:12,467 --> 00:24:13,629
You're leaving.

531
00:24:13,736 --> 00:24:15,969
First Minister Shakaar
was very clear.

532
00:24:16,009 --> 00:24:17,877
All Bajorans must
leave the station

533
00:24:17,913 --> 00:24:19,212
for their own safety.

534
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,549
But what about you?

535
00:24:20,586 --> 00:24:22,648
My job is here,
with Chief O'Brien.

536
00:24:22,758 --> 00:24:24,318
Then I'm not going, either.

537
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:25,524
You see that, Nog?

538
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:27,627
We've barely finished
saying our vows

539
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:30,472
and we're already
having our first fight.

540
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,606
We're really married.

541
00:24:32,649 --> 00:24:34,449
You've got to go, Leeta.

542
00:24:34,486 --> 00:24:38,690
The problems of two newlyweds
are but a small thread

543
00:24:38,763 --> 00:24:40,700
in the tapestry
of galactic events.

544
00:24:40,801 --> 00:24:42,498
You might not
understand that today

545
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:43,872
or even tomorrow

546
00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:46,711
but someday you will.

547
00:24:46,783 --> 00:24:49,084
So get on that shuttle

548
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:51,149
and don't look back.

549
00:24:51,193 --> 00:24:54,565
Nog, take your Moogie
to the Docking Ring.

550
00:24:57,374 --> 00:24:59,504
Nice speech, Dad.

551
00:25:03,622 --> 00:25:04,612
I thought so.

552
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:12,003
Computer, what's the status
of program Sisko-1-9-7?

553
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:14,845
All necessary modifications
have been completed.

554
00:25:14,883 --> 00:25:18,187
Program Sisko-1-9-7
ready for implementation

555
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,626
on your command.

556
00:25:19,661 --> 00:25:21,358
Ops to Captain Sisko.

557
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:24,395
Sir, we're receiving a message
from the Cardassian border.

558
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:26,102
It's General Martok.

559
00:25:28,382 --> 00:25:29,749
On screen.

560
00:25:29,786 --> 00:25:31,016
Aye, sir.

561
00:25:31,055 --> 00:25:33,653
Captain, we just detected

562
00:25:33,694 --> 00:25:36,895
a large force of Dominion ships
headed your way.

563
00:25:36,936 --> 00:25:39,875
They should be there
within the hou...

564
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,013
Someone is jamming
his transmission.

565
00:25:44,053 --> 00:25:46,183
Contact established.

566
00:25:46,225 --> 00:25:48,093
Captain Sisko

567
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:51,365
I don't suppose
you would like to surrender

568
00:25:51,404 --> 00:25:53,875
and avoid unnecessary bloodshed.

569
00:25:55,981 --> 00:25:57,644
Absolutely not.

570
00:25:57,686 --> 00:26:00,420
I was hoping you'd say that.

571
00:26:04,034 --> 00:26:05,628
Battle stations.

572
00:26:13,957 --> 00:26:15,119
How much longer?

573
00:26:15,161 --> 00:26:16,129
The Dominion fleet

574
00:26:16,164 --> 00:26:17,633
should be in weapons
range in 20 minutes.

575
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:19,296
Are all the Bajorans
off the station?

576
00:26:19,337 --> 00:26:21,331
The last transport just left.

577
00:26:21,376 --> 00:26:24,646
Let's hope the Dominion
honors the nonaggression pact.

578
00:26:25,686 --> 00:26:28,523
Cadet, put me through
to the <i>Defiant.</i>

579
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,291
Yes, sir.

580
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,492
On screen.

581
00:26:31,533 --> 00:26:33,629
Benjamin, I know
what you're going to say

582
00:26:33,672 --> 00:26:35,575
but we've got at least
another hour of work

583
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:37,273
before we can activate
the minefield.

584
00:26:37,314 --> 00:26:39,376
You don't have an hour,
old man.

585
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:40,581
The Dominion is going
to be here

586
00:26:40,622 --> 00:26:41,612
in less than 20 minutes.

587
00:26:41,657 --> 00:26:42,956
You're going to be
a sitting duck.

588
00:26:42,994 --> 00:26:45,626
Then I hope you can buy us
some more time.

589
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:47,364
Dax out.

590
00:26:47,404 --> 00:26:49,398
Dax to O'Brien.

591
00:26:49,443 --> 00:26:50,411
I know, I know.

592
00:26:50,445 --> 00:26:52,210
Work faster.

593
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:55,314
A medical tricorder, hypospray,
dermal regenerator

594
00:26:55,357 --> 00:26:58,296
and battlefield trauma kit.

595
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:01,167
Medical tricorder, hypospray
dermal regenerator

596
00:27:01,205 --> 00:27:02,538
and battlefield trauma kit.

597
00:27:04,345 --> 00:27:05,404
That's everyone.

598
00:27:05,447 --> 00:27:07,041
Now what?

599
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:11,323
Now we wait...

600
00:27:11,362 --> 00:27:13,697
until the casualties
start coming in.

601
00:27:15,706 --> 00:27:17,574
Are you sure you're all right?

602
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:19,604
I'll be fine.

603
00:27:19,648 --> 00:27:21,413
Besides, my father
won't let me stay in Ops

604
00:27:21,453 --> 00:27:23,890
and, uh, I promised
the Federation News Service

605
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:25,826
a firsthand account
of the battle.

606
00:27:25,863 --> 00:27:27,355
You'll get it.

607
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:31,570
Just remember, Bashir
is spelled with an "i."

608
00:27:39,061 --> 00:27:41,693
I must say, Constable

609
00:27:41,735 --> 00:27:43,797
I admire your composure.

610
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,645
You're an island of tranquillity
in a sea of chaos.

611
00:27:47,682 --> 00:27:49,311
What I am is useless.

612
00:27:49,353 --> 00:27:51,951
My entire staff has been
evacuated to Bajor.

613
00:27:52,026 --> 00:27:55,660
I'm not feeling too terribly
useful myself at this moment.

614
00:27:55,702 --> 00:27:57,570
But if it'd make you
feel any better

615
00:27:57,606 --> 00:27:59,132
you could always deputize me.

616
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:02,878
I'm sure if the Jem'Hadar
board the station

617
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:05,254
you'll make yourself useful.

618
00:28:05,291 --> 00:28:07,125
It's ironic.

619
00:28:07,163 --> 00:28:09,396
When the Klingons
attacked the station

620
00:28:09,435 --> 00:28:11,770
Gul Dukat and I were
fighting side by side.

621
00:28:11,807 --> 00:28:13,937
At one point, he
turned his back to me

622
00:28:14,045 --> 00:28:16,073
and I must admit,
that for a moment

623
00:28:16,117 --> 00:28:19,090
he made a very tempting target.

624
00:28:19,124 --> 00:28:21,961
You'd shoot a man in the back?

625
00:28:22,065 --> 00:28:23,466
Well, it's the safest way,
isn't it?

626
00:28:24,671 --> 00:28:25,765
But then I thought

627
00:28:25,807 --> 00:28:28,439
"Well, no, I can't fight
all these Klingons by myself"

628
00:28:28,481 --> 00:28:30,144
so I let him live.

629
00:28:30,184 --> 00:28:32,155
And now you regret it.

630
00:28:32,189 --> 00:28:34,183
Ah, my dear Constable

631
00:28:34,228 --> 00:28:35,993
before this day is over

632
00:28:36,098 --> 00:28:39,248
everyone on this station
is going to regret it.

633
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:42,446
Rom...

634
00:28:42,489 --> 00:28:44,118
I've always said
you were an idiot

635
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,288
but I never believed it

636
00:28:45,363 --> 00:28:46,559
more than I do at this moment.

637
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:47,658
Brother, if you want
to insult me

638
00:28:47,702 --> 00:28:48,966
it's going to have
to wait till later.

639
00:28:49,005 --> 00:28:49,973
I'm busy.

640
00:28:50,008 --> 00:28:51,136
Busy doing what?

641
00:28:51,177 --> 00:28:53,307
Preparing perimeter defenses
for the attack.

642
00:28:53,382 --> 00:28:56,321
There are dozens
of engineers

643
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,190
that could be doing that.

644
00:28:58,227 --> 00:29:01,257
Starfleet engineers.

645
00:29:01,369 --> 00:29:02,702
Hu-mans.

646
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:06,711
You should be on Bajor
with your new wife.

647
00:29:06,748 --> 00:29:08,411
That's what Leeta said.

648
00:29:08,451 --> 00:29:09,715
Well, she's right.

649
00:29:09,755 --> 00:29:11,418
This is not your fight.

650
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:12,484
It's not your fight,
either

651
00:29:12,528 --> 00:29:13,622
but I don't see you leaving.

652
00:29:13,664 --> 00:29:15,828
I have to look out for my bar.

653
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:18,434
And I have
to look out for you.

654
00:29:18,475 --> 00:29:19,808
Me?

655
00:29:19,845 --> 00:29:20,813
You're my brother.

656
00:29:20,848 --> 00:29:24,084
Whatever happens,
we belong together.

657
00:29:31,741 --> 00:29:35,238
Well, like I said,
you're an idiot.

658
00:29:42,935 --> 00:29:44,370
On screen, Captain.

659
00:29:44,405 --> 00:29:47,003
General Martok, take a defensive
position near the <i>Defiant.</i>

660
00:29:47,044 --> 00:29:48,844
They have to finish
deploying those mines

661
00:29:48,882 --> 00:29:50,249
no matter the cost.

662
00:29:50,285 --> 00:29:51,481
And they will.

663
00:29:51,522 --> 00:29:54,518
You have my word on it, Captain.

664
00:29:55,932 --> 00:29:58,734
Mr. Worf, activate
the weapons array.

665
00:29:58,772 --> 00:29:59,762
Aye, sir.

666
00:30:08,997 --> 00:30:11,834
Captain, as a Major
in the Bajoran Militia

667
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:14,307
I must officially protest
Starfleet's refusal

668
00:30:14,343 --> 00:30:16,314
to turn over this station
to my government.

669
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:17,782
Your protest is duly noted.

670
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:18,807
Good.

671
00:30:18,854 --> 00:30:21,087
Now that that's over with...

672
00:30:21,126 --> 00:30:23,792
Kira Nerys reporting for duty.

673
00:30:42,444 --> 00:30:44,038
Weapons range in one minute.

674
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:48,118
I've been waiting
for this moment

675
00:30:48,157 --> 00:30:49,216
for five years.

676
00:30:49,259 --> 00:30:52,096
First, we reclaim Terok Nor

677
00:30:52,133 --> 00:30:55,072
then... on to Bajor.

678
00:30:55,108 --> 00:30:56,702
Let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

679
00:30:56,745 --> 00:30:58,943
Or must I remind you
the Dominion just signed

680
00:30:58,983 --> 00:31:00,543
a nonaggression pact
with Bajor?

681
00:31:00,587 --> 00:31:02,352
The Dominion might have.

682
00:31:02,392 --> 00:31:03,759
I never did.

683
00:31:04,964 --> 00:31:07,094
The Dominion will honor
its treaty

684
00:31:07,136 --> 00:31:08,503
and as a member
of the Dominion

685
00:31:08,606 --> 00:31:10,702
you will honor it as well.

686
00:31:13,384 --> 00:31:16,255
Where the Dominion
leads, I will follow.

687
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,487
I never doubted it.

688
00:31:19,098 --> 00:31:23,632
Attack wings one through five,
head for the <i>Defiant.</i>

689
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:26,112
Remaining ships

690
00:31:26,148 --> 00:31:27,617
target the station.

691
00:31:33,132 --> 00:31:34,567
We're within weapons range.

692
00:31:34,635 --> 00:31:36,503
Well...

693
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:38,304
then by all means...

694
00:31:39,748 --> 00:31:41,616
fire.

695
00:31:46,396 --> 00:31:48,025
Mr. Worf, all weapons
fire at will.

696
00:32:12,927 --> 00:32:14,453
Enemy ships are closing
on the <i>Defiant.</i>

697
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:16,692
Mr. Worf.

698
00:32:16,736 --> 00:32:17,601
Got them.

699
00:32:24,287 --> 00:32:26,953
Sir, the station's shields
are holding.

700
00:32:26,994 --> 00:32:27,962
Impossible.

701
00:32:27,996 --> 00:32:29,021
Federation shields

702
00:32:29,066 --> 00:32:31,299
have always proven
useless against our weapons.

703
00:32:31,338 --> 00:32:33,434
I've found it wise
to never underestimate

704
00:32:33,476 --> 00:32:35,947
the Federation's technical skill

705
00:32:35,983 --> 00:32:38,956
or Captain Sisko's
resourcefulness.

706
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,758
Damar, bring us around
for another pass.

707
00:32:59,505 --> 00:33:00,701
Chief, how much longer?

708
00:33:00,741 --> 00:33:02,370
Just another couple of minutes.

709
00:33:02,412 --> 00:33:04,849
Take us to our final
set of coordinates.

710
00:33:04,885 --> 00:33:06,650
Helm, set course...

711
00:33:13,706 --> 00:33:17,842
Chief, I'm going to have to take
evasive maneuvers.

712
00:33:17,882 --> 00:33:20,616
If you do, you risk setting off
every mine on this ship.

713
00:33:23,396 --> 00:33:24,922
And if I don't

714
00:33:24,966 --> 00:33:26,731
we may not have a ship left!

715
00:33:36,795 --> 00:33:38,993
You may continue your work,
Commander.

716
00:33:39,034 --> 00:33:41,939
I will handle the Jem'Hadar.

717
00:33:41,974 --> 00:33:45,072
Who says there's never a Klingon
around when you need one?

718
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:53,261
Shields at 35 percent.

719
00:33:53,301 --> 00:33:55,772
They're preparing
for another attack.

720
00:33:55,807 --> 00:33:58,871
Mr. Worf,
make every shot count.

721
00:33:58,914 --> 00:34:01,044
Attack wings and batteries

722
00:34:01,087 --> 00:34:04,288
concentrate your firepower
on Section 17

723
00:34:04,327 --> 00:34:06,457
of the Outer Docking Ring.

724
00:34:06,499 --> 00:34:09,404
We have to penetrate
their shields.

725
00:34:30,991 --> 00:34:32,791
We've lost main power
to the shields.

726
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,297
Switching to auxiliary power

727
00:34:34,332 --> 00:34:36,394
but I do not know
how long it will hold.

728
00:34:40,814 --> 00:34:42,443
<i>Defiant</i> to Captain Sisko.

729
00:34:42,485 --> 00:34:43,453
Dax, go ahead.

730
00:34:43,488 --> 00:34:45,117
We've set the last mine.

731
00:34:45,158 --> 00:34:47,824
Activate the field
and return to the station.

732
00:34:47,898 --> 00:34:48,957
Yes, sir.
Dax out.

733
00:34:58,022 --> 00:34:59,616
Sir, the minefields...

734
00:34:59,659 --> 00:35:01,026
I have eyes, Damar.

735
00:35:01,063 --> 00:35:03,466
This isn't turning out
quite the way I had planned.

736
00:35:03,502 --> 00:35:05,735
It's a minor setback, Weyoun.

737
00:35:05,774 --> 00:35:07,642
Once we take the station

738
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:09,444
we'll be able
to dismantle the minefield

739
00:35:09,483 --> 00:35:10,679
without interference.

740
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,352
Let's both hope your
confidence is justified.

741
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:20,666
Damar, signal the reserves
to prepare for a final assault.

742
00:35:22,281 --> 00:35:24,184
The Dominion fleet
is regrouping.

743
00:35:25,388 --> 00:35:26,857
And I'm detecting another wave

744
00:35:26,925 --> 00:35:28,862
of enemy ships
entering Bajoran space.

745
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,559
What are your orders, Captain?

746
00:35:30,601 --> 00:35:32,595
We've done all we can here.

747
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:36,205
Notify all remaining
Starfleet personnel.

748
00:35:36,248 --> 00:35:39,671
We're evacuating the station.

749
00:35:49,594 --> 00:35:51,188
Report to the staging area.

750
00:35:54,037 --> 00:35:55,336
Worf!

751
00:35:55,374 --> 00:35:56,741
Jadzia.

752
00:35:56,778 --> 00:35:59,147
You should be on the <i>Defiant.</i>

753
00:35:59,184 --> 00:36:00,448
I heard you're not
coming with us...

754
00:36:00,486 --> 00:36:02,115
that you've been assigned
to Martok's ship.

755
00:36:02,158 --> 00:36:04,687
It may be some time
before we see each other again.

756
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,633
Worf, we may never
see each other again.

757
00:36:06,668 --> 00:36:08,571
This is war...
we must put aside

758
00:36:08,606 --> 00:36:09,734
our personal feelings

759
00:36:09,775 --> 00:36:11,369
and focus on the task at hand.

760
00:36:11,413 --> 00:36:13,076
I've been through
my share of wars.

761
00:36:13,117 --> 00:36:14,381
I know what I have to do.

762
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,357
But before you leave

763
00:36:16,392 --> 00:36:19,490
I want you to know
that the answer is "yes."

764
00:36:19,566 --> 00:36:20,499
Yes...

765
00:36:20,569 --> 00:36:21,502
Yes to what?

766
00:36:21,571 --> 00:36:23,769
Yes, I will marry you.

767
00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:27,045
That's what you've wanted
from the beginning, isn't it?

768
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:29,248
Yes.

769
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:30,314
Yes, it is.

770
00:36:30,358 --> 00:36:33,855
Then, when all of this is over,
we'll get married.

771
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,933
And if that doesn't give
you a reason to survive

772
00:36:37,977 --> 00:36:39,845
I don't know what will.

773
00:36:54,048 --> 00:36:56,178
When I first took command
of this post

774
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,691
all I wanted was
to be somewhere else...

775
00:36:58,726 --> 00:37:01,129
anywhere but here.

776
00:37:01,165 --> 00:37:03,227
But now, five years later

777
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:07,303
this has become my home,
and you have become my family.

778
00:37:07,347 --> 00:37:09,250
And leaving this station...
leaving you...

779
00:37:09,285 --> 00:37:13,318
is one of the hardest things
I've ever had to do.

780
00:37:13,361 --> 00:37:16,391
But this war isn't over yet.

781
00:37:16,436 --> 00:37:18,930
I want you to know
that while we were keeping

782
00:37:18,975 --> 00:37:22,541
the Dominion occupied,
a Starfleet-Klingon task force

783
00:37:22,583 --> 00:37:24,052
crossed the border
into Cardassia

784
00:37:24,087 --> 00:37:27,584
and destroyed the Dominion
shipyards on Torros III.

785
00:37:27,628 --> 00:37:28,927
Your sacrifices...

786
00:37:28,965 --> 00:37:32,633
our sacrifices
made that victory possible.

787
00:37:34,312 --> 00:37:39,416
But no victory can make
this moment any easier for me.

788
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:46,805
And I promise, I will not rest
until I stand with you again...

789
00:37:46,841 --> 00:37:48,971
here...

790
00:37:49,013 --> 00:37:52,009
in this place where I belong.

791
00:37:57,099 --> 00:37:58,625
Sisko to <i>Defiant.</i>

792
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,230
Standing by, sir.

793
00:38:01,744 --> 00:38:03,806
One to beam aboard.

794
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:05,079
Aye, Captain.

795
00:38:12,169 --> 00:38:13,263
Are we ready?

796
00:38:13,305 --> 00:38:14,740
As soon as you give the word,
sir.

797
00:38:14,775 --> 00:38:16,438
Mr. Garak?

798
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,245
I'd like to come along,
if you don't mind.

799
00:38:18,283 --> 00:38:20,311
You never know when you
might need a good tailor.

800
00:38:20,355 --> 00:38:24,354
And the simple fact is,
I have nowhere else to go.

801
00:38:24,398 --> 00:38:25,560
Welcome aboard.

802
00:38:25,601 --> 00:38:26,660
Dax to Sisko.

803
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:27,762
The Dominion fleet

804
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:29,868
is coming around
for another attack.

805
00:38:29,911 --> 00:38:31,403
Release docking clamps.

806
00:38:31,449 --> 00:38:32,918
Prepare for departure.

807
00:38:53,635 --> 00:38:55,538
The <i>Defiant's</i> away.

808
00:38:55,573 --> 00:38:58,102
Contact the Dominion fleet.

809
00:38:58,146 --> 00:38:59,410
Tell them...

810
00:38:59,449 --> 00:39:02,616
the Bajoran government
welcomes them to Deep Space 9.

811
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:07,065
Message acknowledged.

812
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,501
Good.

813
00:39:08,537 --> 00:39:09,665
It's the last message

814
00:39:09,707 --> 00:39:11,336
this station will be
sending out for a while.

815
00:39:11,377 --> 00:39:12,676
Computer...

816
00:39:12,714 --> 00:39:15,710
initiate program Sisko-1-9-7.

817
00:39:15,754 --> 00:39:17,748
Program initiated.

818
00:39:33,664 --> 00:39:35,965
Dukat wanted the station back.

819
00:39:36,003 --> 00:39:37,632
He can have it.

820
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,078
I don't want to see
a drop of root beer

821
00:39:41,115 --> 00:39:42,379
left in this place.

822
00:39:42,419 --> 00:39:44,253
Break out the <i>kanar.</i>

823
00:39:44,289 --> 00:39:46,487
And find me some <i>yamok</i> sauce.

824
00:39:47,898 --> 00:39:48,797
Rom...

825
00:39:48,901 --> 00:39:49,800
assistant manager

826
00:39:49,903 --> 00:39:52,067
for policy and clientele.

827
00:39:52,108 --> 00:39:53,771
Reporting for work, Brother.

828
00:39:53,813 --> 00:39:55,716
What, did you think you could
just walk back in here

829
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:56,718
and get your old job back?

830
00:39:56,753 --> 00:39:58,120
Actually, I'm a spy...

831
00:39:58,156 --> 00:39:59,523
working for Starfleet.

832
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,690
But don't tell anyone.

833
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:04,203
The Federation's more desperate
than I thought.

834
00:40:06,042 --> 00:40:08,776
I knew one day
you'd come crawling back to me.

835
00:40:08,815 --> 00:40:10,079
Now, get to work.

836
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:11,451
Yes, Brother!

837
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:21,533
Jake?

838
00:40:21,578 --> 00:40:24,814
Aren't you supposed
to be on the <i>Defiant?</i>

839
00:40:24,853 --> 00:40:26,254
I changed my mind.

840
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,523
There's a war going on and...

841
00:40:28,562 --> 00:40:31,056
I'm a reporter.

842
00:40:31,102 --> 00:40:32,867
This is where I belong.

843
00:40:37,617 --> 00:40:39,952
But you're not safe here.

844
00:40:41,961 --> 00:40:44,866
The Dominion knows
I'm the Emissary's son.

845
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:45,926
If they hurt me

846
00:40:46,004 --> 00:40:49,706
they risk alienating
their new friends, the Bajorans.

847
00:40:51,383 --> 00:40:52,875
I hope you're right.

848
00:40:54,457 --> 00:40:56,154
So do I.

849
00:40:56,195 --> 00:40:58,166
What the hell is Jake thinking?!

850
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,194
Do we go back for him?

851
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:02,335
I can't risk the entire crew
for one man...

852
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:04,348
even though he is my son.

853
00:41:04,381 --> 00:41:06,409
And whether I like it or not,
he is a man

854
00:41:06,453 --> 00:41:10,224
capable of making
his own choices.

855
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:15,741
Maintain current course.

856
00:41:15,775 --> 00:41:17,712
Aye, Captain.

857
00:41:17,747 --> 00:41:20,948
We should rendezvous
with the Federation task force

858
00:41:21,055 --> 00:41:22,456
in 48 hours.

859
00:41:22,492 --> 00:41:23,654
And then what?

860
00:41:23,694 --> 00:41:25,254
And then,
we make the Dominion sorry

861
00:41:25,299 --> 00:41:27,099
they ever set foot
in the Alpha Quadrant.

862
00:41:27,136 --> 00:41:30,577
Cadet, you took the words
right out of my mouth.

863
00:41:47,317 --> 00:41:49,915
This is a great victory
for Cardassia.

864
00:41:49,957 --> 00:41:51,985
And the Dominion.

865
00:41:52,029 --> 00:41:53,966
Over 50 ships lost...

866
00:41:54,001 --> 00:41:56,701
our spacedocks
on Torros III destroyed.

867
00:41:56,741 --> 00:41:59,212
A victory perhaps,
but a costly one.

868
00:41:59,246 --> 00:42:01,410
We'll discuss
the repercussions later.

869
00:42:01,451 --> 00:42:05,484
Right now, I'm going
to enjoy this moment.

870
00:42:07,967 --> 00:42:10,963
Gentlemen, on behalf
of the Bajoran government...

871
00:42:11,007 --> 00:42:13,001
And the Promenade
Merchants' Association...

872
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:16,611
I officially welcome you
to Deep Space 9.

873
00:42:16,654 --> 00:42:21,758
You mean... Terok Nor,
don't you?

874
00:42:24,073 --> 00:42:25,770
Founder, we are honored

875
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:28,374
by your decision
to remain with us.

876
00:42:28,416 --> 00:42:30,147
I'm not here as a Founder.

877
00:42:30,187 --> 00:42:32,887
I'm the station's
Chief of Security.

878
00:42:32,927 --> 00:42:35,057
Whatever you say.

879
00:42:35,132 --> 00:42:37,969
Nevertheless,
having a God walk amongst us

880
00:42:38,005 --> 00:42:39,304
is most gratifying.

881
00:42:39,342 --> 00:42:41,176
I agree.

882
00:42:41,214 --> 00:42:44,655
You... me...

883
00:42:44,689 --> 00:42:46,592
the Major...

884
00:42:46,724 --> 00:42:48,888
together again.

885
00:42:48,929 --> 00:42:51,162
It should be most interesting.

886
00:42:51,202 --> 00:42:53,868
Now, if you'll excuse me

887
00:42:53,908 --> 00:42:55,708
I'll be in my office.

888
00:43:10,549 --> 00:43:14,388
It would appear
Captain Sisko was most efficient

889
00:43:14,424 --> 00:43:16,224
in disabling the station.

890
00:43:16,262 --> 00:43:18,027
It can be repaired.

891
00:43:18,066 --> 00:43:19,296
And it will be.

892
00:43:19,336 --> 00:43:22,674
But your first priority
is to dismantle that minefield.

893
00:43:22,711 --> 00:43:23,873
Until we can bring in

894
00:43:23,913 --> 00:43:25,576
reinforcements
from the Gamma Quadrant

895
00:43:25,618 --> 00:43:26,951
our position here is vulnerable.

896
00:43:26,988 --> 00:43:28,651
I'll deal with the minefields.

897
00:43:37,346 --> 00:43:40,718
I assume Captain Sisko

Not everything.

900

What is that?

A message... from Sisko.

902
00:43:55,455 --> 00:43:57,186
I don't understand.
