1
00:00:04,433 --> 00:00:08,703
Personal Log, Stardate 47329.4.

2
00:00:08,743 --> 00:00:11,613
I finally realized
why I've had trouble sleeping

3
00:00:11,649 --> 00:00:13,312
the last few nights.

4
00:00:13,351 --> 00:00:15,651
Yesterday was
the fourth anniversary

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,660
of the massacre at Wolf 359...

6
00:00:17,694 --> 00:00:21,155
the fourth anniversary
of Jennifer's death.

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,295
I'm not sure
what bothers me more...

8
00:00:23,338 --> 00:00:24,772
the date itself

9
00:00:24,808 --> 00:00:27,780
or the fact that it almost
passed unnoticed.

10
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,684
Dad, what are you doing up?

11
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,896
I was about to ask you
the same thing.

12
00:00:38,936 --> 00:00:41,065
I-I had a weird dream.

13
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:43,977
Get some hot chocolate
and tell me about it.

14
00:00:44,013 --> 00:00:47,213
Nah, it's nothing.

15
00:00:47,252 --> 00:00:49,119
Ah, come on.

16
00:00:49,156 --> 00:00:52,253
Tell me about this weird dream.

17
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:53,661
It's stupid.

18
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:55,259
Maybe so.

19
00:00:55,302 --> 00:00:57,933
But the thing about dreams is

20
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:00,707
if you talk about them,
they kind of go away faster.

21
00:01:00,747 --> 00:01:03,217
Okay, but don't laugh.

22
00:01:03,318 --> 00:01:04,479
I promise.

23
00:01:06,658 --> 00:01:09,221
I don't know, I was...

24
00:01:09,263 --> 00:01:12,930
I was on the station somewhere...

25
00:01:12,971 --> 00:01:15,339
I'm not sure where...

26
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,777
and I was trying
to get back here

27
00:01:17,814 --> 00:01:20,843
but I couldn't...
I couldn't find my way.

28
00:01:20,887 --> 00:01:24,382
I mean, every time I saw
a familiar corridor

29
00:01:24,427 --> 00:01:27,831
it kind of led
into some other direction.

30
00:01:27,867 --> 00:01:30,201
See, I told you it was stupid.

31
00:01:30,238 --> 00:01:31,969
You got me interested.

32
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,776
Well, then...

33
00:01:34,815 --> 00:01:39,484
I guess I got a little scared
and started looking for you.

34
00:01:39,523 --> 00:01:42,518
But I couldn't find you.

35
00:01:42,563 --> 00:01:44,999
Some... Somehow
I ended up in Ops

36
00:01:45,035 --> 00:01:46,561
but you weren't in your...

37
00:01:46,604 --> 00:01:48,198
you weren't in your office.

38
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:51,042
And... and then it was like...

39
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,745
like the floor started sloping

40
00:01:53,786 --> 00:01:56,279
and... and I couldn't
keep my balance.

41
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,887
And all I wanted to do
was find you.

42
00:02:00,198 --> 00:02:01,997
And here I am.

43
00:02:03,772 --> 00:02:07,176
Dad, I... I love you.

44
00:02:07,212 --> 00:02:09,809
I love you, too.

45
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,466
Oh, I have a calculus test
in the morning.

46
00:02:18,501 --> 00:02:20,596
Then you better get some sleep.

47
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:22,268
Yeah.

48
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:28,312
Dad?

49
00:02:28,421 --> 00:02:30,152
Hmm?

50
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,854
I miss her.

51
00:02:33,298 --> 00:02:34,995
Me, too.

52
00:03:09,637 --> 00:03:12,632
Beautiful, aren't they?

53
00:03:14,013 --> 00:03:17,417
I don't think I've seen
the stars shine so brightly.

54
00:03:20,692 --> 00:03:23,162
The Bajorans call
that constellation

55
00:03:23,197 --> 00:03:24,723
"the Runners."

56
00:03:24,768 --> 00:03:26,635
I can never figure out

57
00:03:26,671 --> 00:03:29,643
if they're running
toward something

58
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:31,670
or away from something.

59
00:03:31,715 --> 00:03:34,151
Does that matter?

60
00:03:34,186 --> 00:03:37,647
Sometimes it just
feels good to run.

61
00:03:37,693 --> 00:03:40,290
I never thought about it
that way.

62
00:03:44,774 --> 00:03:47,837
I'm Benjamin Sisko,
Commander of this station.

63
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,975
I'm...

64
00:03:50,018 --> 00:03:51,885
Fenna.

65
00:03:54,326 --> 00:03:56,558
I'm sorry,
you must be very busy.

66
00:03:56,597 --> 00:03:58,590
I didn't mean to bother you.

67
00:03:58,634 --> 00:04:01,002
You're not bothering me
at all.

68
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,406
Good.

69
00:04:04,279 --> 00:04:06,044
Commander of the station.

70
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,110
That must be very exciting...

71
00:04:08,154 --> 00:04:10,590
all those ships
coming and going.

72
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,188
Every day must bring
something new.

73
00:04:13,231 --> 00:04:15,964
It has its moments.

74
00:04:16,003 --> 00:04:20,034
In some ways, though,
I prefer this time the best

75
00:04:20,078 --> 00:04:23,050
when everything is quiet and...

76
00:04:23,084 --> 00:04:26,284
And you can feel a kind
of anticipation in the air

77
00:04:26,323 --> 00:04:28,418
like something wonderful
is going to happen

78
00:04:28,461 --> 00:04:30,590
but you just don't know
what it is.

79
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:35,107
I guess that sounds
kind of silly, doesn't it?

80
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:36,439
Not at all.

81
00:04:36,544 --> 00:04:39,414
That's one of the great things
about this station.

82
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:42,012
You never know
what's going to happen next.

83
00:04:44,828 --> 00:04:47,459
Or who you're going to meet.

84
00:04:47,532 --> 00:04:49,900
I like it here.

85
00:04:52,275 --> 00:04:54,336
I wish I could stay longer.

86
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:56,281
Where are you going?

87
00:04:58,721 --> 00:05:00,816
I'm not really sure.

88
00:05:02,495 --> 00:05:06,799
I guess I'll just keep going,
like the Runners.

89
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:11,140
I tell you what.

90
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,275
Before you run any farther

91
00:05:13,317 --> 00:05:15,810
why don't I show you
around the station

92
00:05:15,856 --> 00:05:17,416
if you have the time?

93
00:05:25,475 --> 00:05:26,966
Fenna?

94
00:07:33,658 --> 00:07:35,126
Good morning, Chief.

95
00:07:35,161 --> 00:07:36,356
Morning, Commander.

96
00:07:36,397 --> 00:07:38,128
Is this maintenance or repair?

97
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:39,796
Right now, it's maintenance.

98
00:07:39,837 --> 00:07:42,468
Five'll get you ten, it'll be a
repair by the time I'm through.

99
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:43,772
Admit it, Chief.

100
00:07:43,811 --> 00:07:46,339
If you were on a station
where everything worked

101
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:47,351
you'd be miserable.

102
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:48,614
Well, you may be right, sir.

103
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:52,022
But I'd be willing
to give it a try.

104
00:07:52,062 --> 00:07:54,532
Good morning, Major.

105
00:07:54,566 --> 00:07:56,399
Computer, one Chiraltan tea

106
00:07:56,437 --> 00:07:58,464
with a double twist of lemon.

107
00:08:13,404 --> 00:08:15,374
Something wrong?

108
00:08:15,408 --> 00:08:16,842
No, nothing.

109
00:08:16,877 --> 00:08:18,403
If something's
bothering you, Major

110
00:08:18,447 --> 00:08:19,506
I want to hear it.

111
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,575
It's just that...

112
00:08:20,618 --> 00:08:22,247
Every morning
for the last year

113
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:23,655
I've seen you walk in here

114
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:25,593
and start your day
with a <i>raktajino.</i>

115
00:08:25,628 --> 00:08:26,596
I love <i>raktajino.</i>

116
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,620
I know.
You never even talk

117
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,932
to anyone until you've had
your first cup.

118
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,601
Because I'm not awake
until I've had my first cup.

119
00:08:32,642 --> 00:08:33,940
So...

120
00:08:33,978 --> 00:08:36,848
how come you're drinking
Chiraltan tea?

121
00:08:40,058 --> 00:08:41,857
I, uh...

122
00:08:41,894 --> 00:08:45,527
I just felt like
having something different.

123
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:47,401
That is all right with you,
isn't it, Major?

124
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:50,036
Of course.
You can drink whatever you like.

125
00:08:50,078 --> 00:08:51,103
Thank you, Major.

126
00:08:51,146 --> 00:08:53,879
I appreciate your support.

127
00:08:53,918 --> 00:08:55,318
Dax to Sisko.

128
00:08:55,355 --> 00:08:56,653
Go ahead, Lieutenant.

129
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,853
Professor Seyetik
and I are in the Science Lab

130
00:08:58,895 --> 00:09:00,158
if you'd like to meet him.

131
00:09:00,198 --> 00:09:01,393
On my way.

132
00:09:06,877 --> 00:09:09,040
Lieutenant, where's our guest?

133
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:10,516
Inside the flux generator.

134
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:12,077
What?
What's he doing in there?

135
00:09:12,122 --> 00:09:13,181
He could be killed.

136
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:14,988
Well, that's what
I tried to tell him.

137
00:09:15,027 --> 00:09:16,929
And he went in anyway.

138
00:09:16,964 --> 00:09:18,900
Benjamin, have you ever
met a terraformer?

139
00:09:18,935 --> 00:09:20,335
No, what's that
got to do with it?

140
00:09:20,371 --> 00:09:22,568
You can't tell
a terraformer anything.

141
00:09:22,609 --> 00:09:23,941
It's an amazing talent...

142
00:09:23,978 --> 00:09:25,641
bringing dead worlds to life

143
00:09:25,682 --> 00:09:27,413
but humility and common sense

144
00:09:27,452 --> 00:09:29,581
aren't part
of the job description.

145
00:09:29,623 --> 00:09:31,320
Oh.

146
00:09:46,123 --> 00:09:47,683
There you go, Lieutenant.

147
00:09:47,726 --> 00:09:49,457
That should increase

148
00:09:49,496 --> 00:09:52,491
your generator output
by at least five percent.

149
00:09:52,535 --> 00:09:54,767
Ah, you must be Commander Sisko.

150
00:09:54,806 --> 00:09:55,865
Gideon Seyetik.

151
00:09:55,908 --> 00:09:57,274
Great pleasure to meet you, sir.

152
00:09:57,312 --> 00:09:58,280
Professor.

153
00:09:58,314 --> 00:09:59,782
I'm a great admirer
of your work.

154
00:09:59,816 --> 00:10:02,286
Good, a man
of intelligence and taste.

155
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:04,723
I can see we're going
to get along famously.

156
00:10:07,766 --> 00:10:09,257
My son and I visited
Blue Horizon

157
00:10:09,302 --> 00:10:10,600
on the way to Deep Space 9.

158
00:10:10,638 --> 00:10:12,301
I must say, I was impressed.

159
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,638
Of course you were.

160
00:10:13,677 --> 00:10:16,615
I created the place,
and even I'm impressed.

161
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,313
How did you like DaVinci Falls?

162
00:10:18,387 --> 00:10:19,685
We didn't get to see them.

163
00:10:19,723 --> 00:10:21,420
We were on the surface
only for a few hours.

164
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:26,869
Oh, Commander, you missed
Blue Horizon's crowning glory.

165
00:10:26,904 --> 00:10:28,897
Imagine water cascading

166
00:10:28,941 --> 00:10:31,343
off cliffs the height
of Mount Everest

167
00:10:31,447 --> 00:10:34,908
thundering through
continuous rainbows

168
00:10:34,953 --> 00:10:38,084
straight into an ocean
the color of sapphire wine.

169
00:10:38,126 --> 00:10:39,560
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho!

170
00:10:39,596 --> 00:10:41,828
I'm going to have
to take you there one day.

171
00:10:41,867 --> 00:10:44,030
By God, I wouldn't mind
seeing it again myself.

172
00:10:44,071 --> 00:10:46,007
I may take you up on that.

173
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:47,305
Good, good.

174
00:10:47,345 --> 00:10:50,715
But first, Epsilon 119, huh?

175
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,746
Yes, I understand the initial
surveys look promising.

176
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:54,759
Promising?

177
00:10:54,793 --> 00:10:56,261
Why, they look magnificent!

178
00:10:56,296 --> 00:10:59,097
Imagine, reigniting a dead sun

179
00:10:59,135 --> 00:11:03,975
bringing new life
to an entire solar system.

180
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:05,479
Next to that,
terraforming planets

181
00:11:05,515 --> 00:11:07,451
will seem like child's play.

182
00:11:07,485 --> 00:11:08,783
Let's hope it works.

183
00:11:08,821 --> 00:11:11,087
Right now,
it's a promising theory.

184
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,322
Of course it'll work.

185
00:11:13,364 --> 00:11:14,730
I never fail.

186
00:11:14,766 --> 00:11:16,565
Well, I did once.

187
00:11:16,603 --> 00:11:19,005
But I found it didn't
agree with me, so I swore

188
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,569
never to do it again,
and I never break my word.

189
00:11:23,217 --> 00:11:26,189
Oh, you should be glad you're
coming with me, Lieutenant.

190
00:11:26,223 --> 00:11:28,216
This'll be
my crowning achievement.

191
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,391
Giving birth to a star.

192
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,563
Even I would have a hard time
topping that one.

193
00:11:41,502 --> 00:11:43,529
You're not going to let
that last piece

194
00:11:43,573 --> 00:11:45,941
of Andorian tuber root
go to waste, are you?

195
00:11:45,977 --> 00:11:47,036
Why do you ask?

196
00:11:47,112 --> 00:11:48,444
Because it's delicious.

197
00:11:48,482 --> 00:11:49,643
May I?

198
00:11:49,685 --> 00:11:51,211
Be my guest.

199
00:11:51,255 --> 00:11:53,589
I'm going to need
the extra calories

200
00:11:53,626 --> 00:11:55,152
to keep up with Seyetik.

201
00:11:55,195 --> 00:11:57,928
The man works almost
as much as he talks.

202
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:58,936
Benjamin?

203
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,461
What?

204
00:12:00,506 --> 00:12:02,567
Are you looking for someone?

205
00:12:02,611 --> 00:12:05,104
I'm sorry, what were you saying?

206
00:12:05,148 --> 00:12:07,015
Uh, nothing important.

207
00:12:07,052 --> 00:12:09,853
I have to meet
with Chief O'Brien.

208
00:12:09,891 --> 00:12:12,658
We are boosting
the maximum speed

209
00:12:12,697 --> 00:12:15,260
of Seyetik's ship to warp 9.5.

210
00:12:15,303 --> 00:12:18,707
If his experiment fails
and that sun goes supernova

211
00:12:18,743 --> 00:12:21,738
we're going to need
to get out of there fast.

212
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,513
I'll see you in Ops.

213
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:49,735
Benjamin...

214
00:12:49,771 --> 00:12:52,607
I was hoping I'd see you again.

215
00:12:52,644 --> 00:12:55,012
I was just thinking about you.

216
00:12:55,048 --> 00:12:56,380
Were you really?

217
00:12:56,418 --> 00:12:58,752
I've been thinking about you,
too.

218
00:12:58,789 --> 00:13:01,420
Where did you
disappear to last night?

219
00:13:01,462 --> 00:13:02,828
I had to go, I'm sorry.

220
00:13:02,864 --> 00:13:05,198
I didn't mean
to rush away like that.

221
00:13:05,235 --> 00:13:07,296
Does your invitation
still stand?

222
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,572
To show me around the station?

223
00:13:09,611 --> 00:13:12,081
What would you like to see?

224
00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:14,312
Everything.

225
00:13:14,354 --> 00:13:15,914
Everything?

226
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:19,391
That's going to take some time.

227
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:22,130
I don't mind if you don't.

228
00:13:31,522 --> 00:13:33,151
What do you think?

229
00:13:34,628 --> 00:13:35,960
It's wonderful.

230
00:13:35,997 --> 00:13:37,523
I'm glad you like it.

231
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,366
You must come here all the time.

232
00:13:39,404 --> 00:13:40,872
Not really, but when I do

233
00:13:40,907 --> 00:13:43,606
a ship is usually
blocking the view.

234
00:13:43,646 --> 00:13:45,775
We should have brought
a picnic basket.

235
00:13:45,817 --> 00:13:47,251
Here?

236
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:49,313
What better place?

237
00:13:50,726 --> 00:13:54,130
Well, I guess there is tomorrow.

238
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,863
Is that an invitation?

239
00:13:57,874 --> 00:13:59,901
Sounded like one to me.

240
00:14:01,515 --> 00:14:02,642
Then I accept.

241
00:14:02,684 --> 00:14:04,847
Good.

242
00:14:06,157 --> 00:14:07,786
There's plenty left to see.

243
00:14:07,827 --> 00:14:10,856
In fact, I doubt that we can
see it all in one evening.

244
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,236
Then you can show me the rest
after our picnic tomorrow.

245
00:14:15,776 --> 00:14:17,244
Do you always do that?

246
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,474
Do what?

247
00:14:18,515 --> 00:14:21,316
Say exactly the right thing.

248
00:14:23,926 --> 00:14:26,591
Well, no one's ever
told me that before.

249
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:27,964
There you go again.

250
00:14:29,938 --> 00:14:31,635
So...

251
00:14:32,944 --> 00:14:35,437
tell me all about yourself.

252
00:14:37,754 --> 00:14:39,383
There's not much to tell.

253
00:14:39,424 --> 00:14:41,621
Whatever there is,
I want to hear it.

254
00:14:42,931 --> 00:14:44,160
I can't.

255
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:45,531
Can't what?

256
00:14:46,672 --> 00:14:48,403
I can't tell you.

257
00:14:48,442 --> 00:14:50,105
Why not?

258
00:14:53,284 --> 00:14:55,311
I'm sorry, Benjamin,
but I have to go.

259
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,792
Fenna, wait.

260
00:15:12,824 --> 00:15:15,317
So, then Tiet looked
down at Altrina's lunch

261
00:15:15,362 --> 00:15:16,591
and said, "Klingon food?

262
00:15:16,631 --> 00:15:17,929
Those are worms!"

263
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:20,062
And Altrina vomited
all over the table!

264
00:15:23,512 --> 00:15:25,641
It was pretty disgusting.

265
00:15:25,683 --> 00:15:27,209
That's nice, Jake.

266
00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:29,050
Nice?
She threw up!

267
00:15:30,158 --> 00:15:31,217
Hmm?

268
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,455
Oh, I'm sorry.

269
00:15:32,497 --> 00:15:35,594
I guess I must have been
thinking about something else.

270
00:15:37,072 --> 00:15:38,803
Dad...

271
00:15:38,842 --> 00:15:39,935
are you in love?

272
00:15:39,978 --> 00:15:41,709
What?

273
00:15:41,748 --> 00:15:43,216
You know, with a woman?

274
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:45,687
You're showing
all three of the signs.

275
00:15:45,723 --> 00:15:46,713
Signs?

276
00:15:46,758 --> 00:15:49,024
The ones that Nog
told me about:

277
00:15:49,063 --> 00:15:53,630
Loss of appetite, daydreaming,
smiling all the time.

278
00:15:53,672 --> 00:15:56,644
You've been talking to Nog
about women again?

279
00:15:56,678 --> 00:16:01,119
Look, I just want you to know
that if you're in love

280
00:16:01,153 --> 00:16:03,214
it's all right with me.

281
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,597
Thanks, Jake.

282
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:11,198
What's she like?

283
00:16:12,877 --> 00:16:17,045
She's, uh... really interesting.

284
00:16:18,254 --> 00:16:19,483
Interesting, huh?

285
00:16:19,524 --> 00:16:21,790
So, when do I get to meet her?

286
00:16:21,828 --> 00:16:25,198
I think it might be
a little early to do that.

287
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:27,262
Why? She likes you, too,
doesn't she?

288
00:16:27,305 --> 00:16:29,138
I think so.

289
00:16:29,176 --> 00:16:32,580
So, then what's the problem?

290
00:16:36,323 --> 00:16:38,520
Well, um...

291
00:16:39,697 --> 00:16:42,167
it's just that, uh...

292
00:16:44,707 --> 00:16:46,904
she keeps disappearing.

293
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:55,485
Above all, stay alert.

294
00:16:55,529 --> 00:16:58,296
If the subspace transmission
I've received is correct

295
00:16:58,334 --> 00:17:00,531
and Villus Thed is
en route to the station

296
00:17:00,573 --> 00:17:02,873
I want to be notified
the moment he arrives.

297
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,573
Keep him under
constant surveillance

298
00:17:04,614 --> 00:17:06,550
but remember,
he's a short-range telepath

299
00:17:06,585 --> 00:17:09,284
so stay at least five meters
away from him at all times.

300
00:17:09,323 --> 00:17:10,518
That's all.

301
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,552
Yes, sir.

302
00:17:12,597 --> 00:17:16,264
Commander,
what can I do for you?

303
00:17:18,374 --> 00:17:21,107
I need to ask
a favor, Constable.

304
00:17:21,146 --> 00:17:22,979
Of a personal nature.

305
00:17:23,017 --> 00:17:24,315
Go on.

306
00:17:24,353 --> 00:17:27,519
I'm looking for someone...
a woman.

307
00:17:28,662 --> 00:17:29,755
Name?

308
00:17:29,797 --> 00:17:30,890
Fenna.

309
00:17:32,102 --> 00:17:33,901
First name or last?

310
00:17:33,939 --> 00:17:35,704
I don't know.

311
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,211
Species?

312
00:17:37,245 --> 00:17:38,543
I don't know.

313
00:17:38,582 --> 00:17:39,914
Humanoid.

314
00:17:39,951 --> 00:17:43,082
What ship did she arrive on?

315
00:17:43,124 --> 00:17:45,196
I... don't know.

316
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:47,931
Well...

317
00:17:47,968 --> 00:17:51,168
what can you tell me about her?

318
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,676
Let's see...

319
00:17:52,711 --> 00:17:56,378
I'd say she's
about 1.6 meters tall...

320
00:17:56,418 --> 00:17:58,615
brown skin...

321
00:17:58,657 --> 00:18:00,650
dark hair.

322
00:18:00,694 --> 00:18:04,634
The last time I saw her,
she was wearing a...

323
00:18:06,338 --> 00:18:09,435
She was wearing red.

324
00:18:10,546 --> 00:18:13,382
Well, that's something, anyway.

325
00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:16,186
Do you think you can help me?

326
00:18:16,224 --> 00:18:18,694
I don't know.

327
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,461
I need to find her, Constable.

328
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,332
I think she may be
in some kind of trouble.

329
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:23,633
What kind of trouble?

330
00:18:23,673 --> 00:18:26,075
Oh... let me guess.

331
00:18:26,111 --> 00:18:28,047
You don't know.

332
00:18:29,885 --> 00:18:33,723
Well, it's not much to go on,
but I'll do what I can.

333
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,992
I appreciate your help, Odo.

334
00:18:51,094 --> 00:18:52,893
Benjamin, do you have a minute?

335
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:53,990
In my office.

336
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,483
What's on your mind, Dax?

337
00:19:04,521 --> 00:19:06,821
I was hoping you had
something to say to me.

338
00:19:06,859 --> 00:19:08,522
I don't follow you.

339
00:19:08,562 --> 00:19:10,896
You really have no intention
of telling me, do you?

340
00:19:10,934 --> 00:19:12,232
Telling you what?

341
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,465
Come on, Benjamin!

342
00:19:13,505 --> 00:19:16,909
I saw you with her last night
on the Promenade.

343
00:19:16,946 --> 00:19:18,609
What's her name?

344
00:19:20,486 --> 00:19:21,749
Fenna.

345
00:19:21,856 --> 00:19:24,224
But believe me, Dax,
there is nothing to talk about.

346
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,253
You used to tell Curzon
everything.

347
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:28,029
Not everything.

348
00:19:28,068 --> 00:19:29,434
You know what I mean.

349
00:19:29,471 --> 00:19:32,034
It's because I'm
a woman now, isn't it?

350
00:19:32,076 --> 00:19:34,478
Don't be ridiculous!

351
00:19:34,514 --> 00:19:35,675
No, I understand.

352
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:38,245
It's hard to talk
man-to-man with a woman.

353
00:19:38,288 --> 00:19:40,224
That has nothing to do with it.

354
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:43,231
Then tell me what's going on.

355
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,733
I will.

356
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:48,138
As soon as there is
something to tell.

357
00:19:51,081 --> 00:19:53,381
Personal Log, supplemental.

358
00:19:53,418 --> 00:19:57,085
Odo continues to search for
new information about Fenna.

359
00:19:57,126 --> 00:20:00,496
In the meantime, Professor
Seyetik has invited me

360
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:04,234
and the senior staff to dinner
aboard the <i>Prometheus.</i>

361
00:20:04,274 --> 00:20:08,978
A great terraformer needs
the green thumb of a gardener

362
00:20:09,017 --> 00:20:12,787
the eye of a painter
and the soul of a poet.

363
00:20:12,824 --> 00:20:16,092
And of course, it doesn't hurt
to be a raging egomaniac.

364
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:20,435
Which makes you
eminently qualified.

365
00:20:20,472 --> 00:20:21,998
Of course!

366
00:20:23,545 --> 00:20:26,608
Terraforming is amazing enough,
but I don't understand

367
00:20:26,651 --> 00:20:28,780
how you intend
to reignite a dead sun.

368
00:20:28,823 --> 00:20:32,125
Basically, I'll use
a remote piloted shuttlepod

369
00:20:32,163 --> 00:20:35,260
to deliver protomatter
into the dead star.

370
00:20:35,302 --> 00:20:37,636
This will cause a cascade effect

371
00:20:37,673 --> 00:20:41,204
which will transform
the star's carbon and oxygen

372
00:20:41,247 --> 00:20:43,012
into elemental hydrogen.

373
00:20:43,051 --> 00:20:46,490
And then we just stand back
and watch the fireworks.

374
00:20:46,524 --> 00:20:47,856
Of course, if it doesn't work

375
00:20:47,894 --> 00:20:49,727
it might be the last thing
we ever see.

376
00:20:49,765 --> 00:20:50,824
Oh, come now, Lieutenant.

377
00:20:50,867 --> 00:20:53,600
Nothing of worth
was ever created by a pessimist.

378
00:20:53,639 --> 00:20:55,073
I don't know about that.

379
00:20:55,109 --> 00:20:56,738
Van Gogh, Beckett, Y'Raka...

380
00:20:56,779 --> 00:20:58,715
I wouldn't exactly
call them optimists.

381
00:20:58,749 --> 00:21:00,776
Precisely,
and look at their work...

382
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,290
dark and dreary and dismal.

383
00:21:03,325 --> 00:21:06,695
Art should be
an affirmation of life.

384
00:21:06,731 --> 00:21:09,430
For example, take my own work
in the field.

385
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:13,069
I once saw an exhibit
of your paintings

386
00:21:13,111 --> 00:21:16,606
at the Central Gallery
on Ligobis X.

387
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:19,418
They certainly were memorable.

388
00:21:19,457 --> 00:21:22,486
I don't think I've ever
seen such huge canvases.

389
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:26,698
Doctor, nobody ever accused me
of understatement.

390
00:21:26,738 --> 00:21:27,706
Certainly not anyone

391
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,901
who's ever read
your autobiography.

392
00:21:28,943 --> 00:21:30,434
Nine volumes and counting.

393
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:35,150
You know, I always said
I wanted to write as many books

394
00:21:35,189 --> 00:21:36,954
as I've had marriages.

395
00:21:37,026 --> 00:21:38,893
Ah... which reminds me.

396
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:43,599
Wait till you taste the food
my wife has created for you.

397
00:21:43,638 --> 00:21:47,099
None of that replicated nonsense
you're used to.

398
00:21:47,146 --> 00:21:48,637
No, no, no.

399
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:53,317
Every dish was prepared entirely
by Nidell's own sweet hands.

400
00:21:53,358 --> 00:21:55,521
I can't wait to meet her.

401
00:21:55,562 --> 00:21:56,655
And so you shall.

402
00:21:56,698 --> 00:21:58,361
She should be just about ready.

403
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:00,735
I'll go and get her.

404
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,270
Commander, do you think
he'd notice

405
00:22:04,313 --> 00:22:05,942
if we weren't here
when he got back?

406
00:22:06,017 --> 00:22:07,577
Don't even think
about it, Major.

407
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,319
I've had dinner with about
two dozen Bajoran ministers.

408
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:11,725
I think you owe me this one.

409
00:22:11,761 --> 00:22:15,724
Besides, Seyetik is one of
the Federation's greatest minds.

410
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:17,534
I know, he told me.

411
00:22:17,573 --> 00:22:21,343
Well, I, for one, find him
remarkably entertaining.

412
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:23,884
Ladies and gentlemen

413
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:28,327
I'd like you to meet my wife
and my inspiration... Nidell.

414
00:22:35,877 --> 00:22:38,849
Now we have something
to talk about.

415
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,498
I can't eat another bite.

416
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,264
That was delicious.

417
00:22:49,303 --> 00:22:51,034
Do you think
I could have the recipe?

418
00:22:51,074 --> 00:22:53,340
You'll have to ask Gideon.

419
00:22:53,378 --> 00:22:55,211
It's his creation.

420
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:58,710
Well, it took me years
to perfect it.

421
00:22:58,755 --> 00:23:01,693
The secret, you see, is to sear

422
00:23:01,728 --> 00:23:03,925
the Kalo roots slightly
before layering them

423
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,799
over the slices
of roasted Waroon.

424
00:23:05,836 --> 00:23:07,965
But the most important...

425
00:23:08,008 --> 00:23:10,274
She acts like
she doesn't recognize me.

426
00:23:10,312 --> 00:23:12,441
...one liter
of clear Rumall stock...

427
00:23:12,483 --> 00:23:14,282
It is the same woman, isn't it?

428
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,017
She looks the same.

429
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:17,616
...of Vulcan redspice

430
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,188
half a dozen Humat pods
and a dash of ice salt.

431
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,170
And then you reduce it
in an Andorian boiler

432
00:23:23,204 --> 00:23:26,040
cook it exactly
500 degrees Kelvin

433
00:23:26,144 --> 00:23:29,116
and then you just
pepper to taste.

434
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,990
Any questions?

435
00:23:33,024 --> 00:23:34,584
Ah, maybe you should
write that down.

436
00:23:35,796 --> 00:23:37,390
Of course.

437
00:23:37,433 --> 00:23:39,665
No trouble at all.

438
00:23:39,704 --> 00:23:42,835
Well... I think we should
continue this conversation

439
00:23:42,876 --> 00:23:44,071
in the other room.

440
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:47,175
We shall be
more comfortable there.

441
00:23:58,041 --> 00:24:01,013
Commander, can I help
you with something?

442
00:24:01,047 --> 00:24:03,040
I hope so.

443
00:24:04,453 --> 00:24:06,582
It would have been a lot easier

444
00:24:06,624 --> 00:24:08,992
if you'd told me
you were married.

445
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,023
I don't understand.

446
00:24:11,067 --> 00:24:12,262
Yesterday...

447
00:24:12,302 --> 00:24:13,736
on the Promenade...

448
00:24:13,772 --> 00:24:16,072
you had plenty of opportunity.

449
00:24:16,144 --> 00:24:19,241
Commander, I don't know
what you're talking about.

450
00:24:19,283 --> 00:24:21,412
I've never met you
before tonight.

451
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:29,327
I suppose you never told me
that your name was Fenna.

452
00:24:35,115 --> 00:24:37,415
Would you like
to talk about this?

453
00:24:37,453 --> 00:24:40,016
Commander, obviously
you have mistaken me

454
00:24:40,058 --> 00:24:41,458
for someone else.

455
00:24:47,139 --> 00:24:49,609
Seems that way...

456
00:24:49,643 --> 00:24:51,738
doesn't it?

457
00:24:58,562 --> 00:25:01,363
I'm telling you, Dax,
it was the same woman.

458
00:25:01,401 --> 00:25:03,769
The face, the voice...
it was Fenna.

459
00:25:03,806 --> 00:25:06,437
Maybe you have to talk to her
when her husband isn't around.

460
00:25:06,478 --> 00:25:08,175
Dax, she's a married woman.

461
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:10,549
That would have never
stopped Curzon.

462
00:25:10,586 --> 00:25:13,854
It's just that this
was the first time

463
00:25:13,893 --> 00:25:18,460
since Jennifer's death that
I felt... drawn to someone.

464
00:25:18,502 --> 00:25:20,699
Commander, may I have
a word with you?

465
00:25:23,345 --> 00:25:25,042
I thought you should know

466
00:25:25,082 --> 00:25:28,145
I've checked this week's
docking and transporter logs

467
00:25:28,188 --> 00:25:29,919
and there is no record

468
00:25:29,958 --> 00:25:32,987
of anyone matching
the description you gave me.

469
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,431
Thanks, Odo.

470
00:25:34,467 --> 00:25:36,699
But you can call off
your search.

471
00:25:36,738 --> 00:25:38,708
I've already found
the woman I was looking for.

472
00:25:38,776 --> 00:25:40,210
You did?

473
00:25:40,246 --> 00:25:43,616
And where was she,
if you don't mind my asking?

474
00:25:43,652 --> 00:25:45,349
Aboard the <i>Prometheus.</i>

475
00:25:45,389 --> 00:25:46,721
The <i>Prometheus?</i>

476
00:25:46,825 --> 00:25:48,054
Are you sure?

477
00:25:48,095 --> 00:25:50,065
Yes, we just left there
a few minutes ago.

478
00:25:50,099 --> 00:25:51,533
That's impossible.

479
00:25:51,568 --> 00:25:52,968
What do you mean?

480
00:25:53,004 --> 00:25:56,739
I checked the de-embarkation
logs as part of my search.

481
00:25:56,812 --> 00:25:59,511
With the exception
of Professor Seyetik

482
00:25:59,551 --> 00:26:01,680
no one has left the <i>Prometheus</i>

483
00:26:01,722 --> 00:26:05,024
during the entire time
it's been at the station.

484
00:26:13,212 --> 00:26:14,180
Commander...

485
00:26:14,214 --> 00:26:16,377
I thought you could use this.

486
00:26:16,418 --> 00:26:18,718
No thanks, I was just leaving.

487
00:26:18,756 --> 00:26:21,124
Stood you up, didn't she?

488
00:26:21,161 --> 00:26:23,860
When you've worked
in a bar as long as I have

489
00:26:23,899 --> 00:26:25,732
you get to recognize that look.

490
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:28,537
I've even seen it
in the mirror once or twice.

491
00:26:28,575 --> 00:26:30,670
I'd better be getting home.

492
00:26:30,713 --> 00:26:31,874
If you like

493
00:26:31,915 --> 00:26:35,081
we could go down to the bar
and talk...

494
00:26:35,122 --> 00:26:36,989
you know, about women.

495
00:26:37,025 --> 00:26:39,086
I don't think so.

496
00:26:41,902 --> 00:26:43,496
Don't forget...

497
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:46,841
the holosuites are always open.

498
00:27:01,608 --> 00:27:02,906
Benjamin!

499
00:27:06,918 --> 00:27:09,411
I missed you.

500
00:27:12,396 --> 00:27:13,956
Is there something wrong?

501
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:15,126
I just had dinner

502
00:27:15,169 --> 00:27:17,834
with someone who looks
exactly like you.

503
00:27:19,277 --> 00:27:20,677
Like me?

504
00:27:20,713 --> 00:27:22,147
How strange.

505
00:27:25,456 --> 00:27:29,294
You're telling me that your name
isn't really Nidell

506
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:32,427
and you're not the wife
of Gideon Seyetik?

507
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,802
Of course not.

508
00:27:33,906 --> 00:27:35,808
I'm Fenna.
You know that.

509
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:38,746
Right now, I'm not
sure what I know.

510
00:27:41,488 --> 00:27:44,016
I don't suppose you have
a twin sister, do you?

511
00:27:45,229 --> 00:27:46,458
Not that I know of.

512
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:49,602
Fenna...

513
00:27:49,637 --> 00:27:52,666
I need to know
where you came from

514
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:55,273
and what you're doing
on this station.

515
00:27:55,316 --> 00:27:57,445
Does that matter?

516
00:27:59,457 --> 00:28:01,825
Of course it matters.

517
00:28:05,636 --> 00:28:08,972
I need to know who you are.

518
00:28:16,591 --> 00:28:18,584
You do know me, Benjamin.

519
00:28:18,629 --> 00:28:22,068
When I came here,
I thought I was looking

520
00:28:22,102 --> 00:28:24,095
for a place...

521
00:28:24,139 --> 00:28:27,475
somewhere I belonged...
but I was wrong.

522
00:28:27,513 --> 00:28:33,082
I wasn't looking for a place;
I was looking for a person.

523
00:28:33,124 --> 00:28:35,026
I was looking for you.

524
00:29:01,581 --> 00:29:03,414
Benjamin...

525
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,083
All right, Lieutenant.

526
00:29:24,126 --> 00:29:26,153
I've got the warp drive
on the <i>Prometheus</i>

527
00:29:26,196 --> 00:29:27,323
purring like a kitten.

528
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:28,561
It'll do 9.6 in a pinch

529
00:29:28,602 --> 00:29:30,367
but I wouldn't take it
any faster.

530
00:29:30,406 --> 00:29:32,205
I thought
the theoretical maximum

531
00:29:32,242 --> 00:29:33,905
for those engines was warp 9.5.

532
00:29:33,979 --> 00:29:35,379
Well, it was.

533
00:29:35,416 --> 00:29:37,010
Must I remind you, Lieutenant

534
00:29:37,052 --> 00:29:39,683
some of us have
only one lifetime?

535
00:29:39,724 --> 00:29:41,353
I'll be right there.

536
00:29:43,164 --> 00:29:45,657
Good luck, Lieutenant.

537
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:47,763
Commander.

538
00:29:47,807 --> 00:29:49,640
Come to see us off, Benjamin?

539
00:29:49,677 --> 00:29:51,704
Not exactly...
I'm going with you.

540
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:54,948
How often do you get a chance
to see a star reborn?

541
00:29:55,054 --> 00:29:57,217
Do you really think
this is a good idea?

542
00:29:57,258 --> 00:29:58,624
I need answers, Dax.

543
00:29:58,662 --> 00:30:01,132
And the key
to Fenna's disappearance

544
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,600
may be on that ship.

545
00:30:16,831 --> 00:30:17,992
Have you finished loading

546
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:20,003
the protomatter device
into the shuttle pod?

547
00:30:20,104 --> 00:30:21,436
All set.

548
00:30:21,474 --> 00:30:23,205
The containment fields
are holding fine.

549
00:30:23,244 --> 00:30:25,305
Remote guidance systems
are fully operational.

550
00:30:25,349 --> 00:30:27,114
I'm telling you, Commander

551
00:30:27,152 --> 00:30:29,622
by the time I was through
with New Halana

552
00:30:29,657 --> 00:30:31,320
it was a veritable paradise.

553
00:30:31,361 --> 00:30:32,734
How are we doing, Mr. Piersall?

554
00:30:32,867 --> 00:30:35,360
We'll be initiating preliminary
scans in a few hours.

555
00:30:35,406 --> 00:30:37,672
Well, let me know
when we get there.

556
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:41,046
Well, Professor, you must
be eager to get started.

557
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:42,517
What did you call this?

558
00:30:42,554 --> 00:30:44,217
Your crowning achievement.

559
00:30:44,256 --> 00:30:46,055
Ah, don't remind me.

560
00:30:46,093 --> 00:30:48,393
Commander, my entire life

561
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:52,167
has been a series
of escalating triumphs.

562
00:30:52,206 --> 00:30:53,835
It's what I live for...

563
00:30:53,876 --> 00:30:55,573
knowing that no matter
what I achieve

564
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,946
there's always another
triumph waiting for me.

565
00:30:57,984 --> 00:30:59,510
And now?

566
00:30:59,554 --> 00:31:00,988
Well...

567
00:31:01,023 --> 00:31:05,521
Are you familiar
with the Klingon poet G'Trok?

568
00:31:05,566 --> 00:31:06,761
A little.

569
00:31:06,802 --> 00:31:09,535
<i>The Fall of Kang</i> is required
reading at the Academy.

570
00:31:09,574 --> 00:31:10,564
Ah...

571
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:12,910
"So honor the valiant

572
00:31:12,947 --> 00:31:14,746
who die 'neath
your sword..."

573
00:31:14,784 --> 00:31:17,722
"But pity the warrior
who slays all his foes."

574
00:31:17,757 --> 00:31:19,055
Well...

575
00:31:19,093 --> 00:31:21,086
yes, well...

576
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:25,468
a bit obvious perhaps,
but true nonetheless.

577
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:29,574
So, what were we talking about?

578
00:31:29,648 --> 00:31:30,581
You.

579
00:31:30,683 --> 00:31:31,708
Hah! Of course.

580
00:31:31,752 --> 00:31:32,947
My favorite subject.

581
00:31:32,987 --> 00:31:34,216
Where was I?

582
00:31:34,256 --> 00:31:36,590
You had just finished
terraforming New Halana.

583
00:31:36,662 --> 00:31:37,857
Ah, of course.

584
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:38,990
Well, you can imagine

585
00:31:39,033 --> 00:31:40,900
how grateful
the New Halanans were.

586
00:31:40,937 --> 00:31:45,139
Endless parades
and receptions and...

587
00:31:45,178 --> 00:31:48,275
Got to be a bit of a bore,
actually.

588
00:31:48,318 --> 00:31:51,119
But then I... I met Nidell.

589
00:31:51,157 --> 00:31:53,822
She was the daughter
of a local dignitary

590
00:31:53,862 --> 00:31:57,825
and she was utterly infatuated
with me from the very start.

591
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:00,569
Well, I-I can't say
I blame her, actually.

592
00:32:00,609 --> 00:32:02,238
The first time she saw me

593
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:04,715
I was surrounded
by crowds of people

594
00:32:04,751 --> 00:32:06,846
unveiling a statue
they'd commissioned

595
00:32:06,888 --> 00:32:09,222
in my, in my honor.

596
00:32:09,259 --> 00:32:13,097
Well, I could...
I could tell from the start

597
00:32:13,134 --> 00:32:15,468
she was something special.

598
00:32:15,506 --> 00:32:17,442
You know,
she'd never been off-world

599
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,606
before she met me.

600
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:22,881
I promised to show her
the galaxy.

601
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:26,792
I would have given it to her
if I could have.

602
00:32:26,828 --> 00:32:29,823
She must love you very much.

603
00:32:29,868 --> 00:32:32,396
She does, Commander.

604
00:32:34,309 --> 00:32:37,611
Don't ask me why, but...

605
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:40,520
she does.

606
00:32:53,482 --> 00:32:54,677
Fenna?

607
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:57,779
Benjamin, I'm so glad
to see you.

608
00:32:59,259 --> 00:33:02,754
Dax, report to my quarters
immediately.

609
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,098
On my way.

610
00:33:04,136 --> 00:33:05,969
Benjamin, what's wrong?

611
00:33:06,006 --> 00:33:08,944
The last time I saw you...

612
00:33:08,979 --> 00:33:10,642
you vanished.

613
00:33:10,749 --> 00:33:14,153
I'm with you now, and I'm never
going to leave you again.

614
00:33:14,189 --> 00:33:17,320
I wish I could believe that.

615
00:33:21,538 --> 00:33:23,303
You have to, Benjamin.

616
00:33:24,376 --> 00:33:27,712
Dax, this is Fenna.

617
00:33:29,921 --> 00:33:31,287
What is she doing?

618
00:33:31,323 --> 00:33:32,655
It's all right.

619
00:33:32,693 --> 00:33:34,025
She's not going to hurt you.

620
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:38,600
I'm not reading
any cellular structure.

621
00:33:38,639 --> 00:33:40,107
No DNA patterns.

622
00:33:42,613 --> 00:33:44,081
Just pure energy.

623
00:33:44,116 --> 00:33:47,179
Benjamin, what is
she talking about?

624
00:33:47,222 --> 00:33:50,319
I think it's time we find out.

625
00:34:02,485 --> 00:34:04,284
Help her.
She won't wake up.

626
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:13,272
She's in shock.

627
00:34:13,307 --> 00:34:15,140
Her respiration is shallow.

628
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,843
Her heartbeat
is irregular and falling.

629
00:34:17,883 --> 00:34:19,978
Her blood pressure's dropping.

630
00:34:20,021 --> 00:34:21,421
Benjamin, she's dying.

631
00:34:21,457 --> 00:34:23,359
But you've got to do something!

632
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,489
I don't know that I can.

633
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,968
Fenna!

634
00:34:29,006 --> 00:34:31,306
I should have known.

635
00:34:38,491 --> 00:34:40,518
But you can't be here!

636
00:34:40,561 --> 00:34:42,895
Nidell promised me
you'd never come back.

637
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:46,462
I don't know
what you're talking about.

638
00:34:46,507 --> 00:34:48,101
Just look at her!

639
00:35:05,713 --> 00:35:07,113
She looks like me.

640
00:35:07,148 --> 00:35:08,582
Of course she looks like you!

641
00:35:08,618 --> 00:35:10,417
She is you... the real you.

642
00:35:10,455 --> 00:35:12,891
Professor,
what the hell is going on here?

643
00:35:12,927 --> 00:35:15,490
That thing over there
isn't real.

644
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:16,931
She's an illusion

645
00:35:16,968 --> 00:35:19,963
created by my wife's
unconscious mind.

646
00:35:20,007 --> 00:35:21,066
That's not true!

647
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:23,342
Benjamin, you know
that he's lying.

648
00:35:23,381 --> 00:35:26,251
Nidell is
a psychoprojective telepath.

649
00:35:26,286 --> 00:35:29,690
Fenna's just another one
of her projections.

650
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:31,059
Lieutenant?

651
00:35:31,096 --> 00:35:33,328
I've never seen readings
like these.

652
00:35:33,367 --> 00:35:36,898
Her occipital lobe is giving off
enormous amounts of energy.

653
00:35:36,941 --> 00:35:39,070
I don't see
how she could survive

654
00:35:39,112 --> 00:35:40,809
more than an hour or two
like this.

655
00:35:40,916 --> 00:35:41,906
But she's dying!

656
00:35:41,951 --> 00:35:43,180
You've got to do something!

657
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,417
There's nothing I can do.

658
00:35:46,593 --> 00:35:47,822
Get Fenna to my quarters, Dax.

659
00:35:47,863 --> 00:35:48,922
And notify Lieutenant...

660
00:35:48,965 --> 00:35:50,399
No!

661
00:35:52,105 --> 00:35:53,631
Get her out of here, Dax.

662
00:35:53,675 --> 00:35:55,304
Benjamin, I want
to stay with you.

663
00:35:55,344 --> 00:35:56,710
It will be all right, Fenna.

664
00:35:56,748 --> 00:35:59,116
I just need to talk
to Professor Seyetik, here.

665
00:36:01,223 --> 00:36:03,786
All right, Professor,
if what you're saying is true

666
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:07,131
Nidell's psychoprojective
abilities are killing her

667
00:36:07,168 --> 00:36:08,694
and I need to know why.

668
00:36:23,033 --> 00:36:26,335
Nidell doesn't even
know this is happening.

669
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:31,148
In times of deep
emotional distress

670
00:36:31,183 --> 00:36:32,982
Halanans sometimes...

671
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,821
Lose control of these abilities.

672
00:36:35,859 --> 00:36:38,159
My wife is very...

673
00:36:38,197 --> 00:36:40,337
emotionally distraught.

674
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:45,879
Oh, this happened once before,
three years ago on Terosa Prime.

675
00:36:45,915 --> 00:36:49,548
It nearly killed her then.

676
00:36:49,588 --> 00:36:53,426
She swore to me
it would never happen again.

677
00:36:53,463 --> 00:36:54,692
Obviously...

678
00:36:56,436 --> 00:36:58,999
it has.

679
00:37:00,845 --> 00:37:04,444
You may have noticed, Commander,
that I tend to evoke

680
00:37:04,485 --> 00:37:08,858
strong emotions from people,
particularly my wives.

681
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:13,267
Oh, they all start out
loving me, but...

682
00:37:13,303 --> 00:37:17,107
a few years of togetherness
soon cure them of that.

683
00:37:18,981 --> 00:37:22,682
The others all had
the good sense to leave me.

684
00:37:24,525 --> 00:37:26,188
But why can't Nidell?

685
00:37:26,229 --> 00:37:28,563
What keeps her with you?

686
00:37:28,633 --> 00:37:32,505
Halanans mate for life.

687
00:37:34,578 --> 00:37:36,343
She can never leave me

688
00:37:36,382 --> 00:37:39,877
no matter how much
she might want to.

689
00:37:52,882 --> 00:37:55,479
Benjamin, I've never seen
Seyetik or that woman before.

690
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,046
I don't know why he's saying

691
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:59,390
those things about me,
but they're lies.

692
00:37:59,428 --> 00:38:01,694
I'm as real as you are.

693
00:38:01,732 --> 00:38:04,225
Oh, how I want to believe that.

694
00:38:04,271 --> 00:38:06,936
But can you tell me
where you came from?

695
00:38:06,977 --> 00:38:08,810
How you got to this station?

696
00:38:08,847 --> 00:38:11,978
Can you tell me
a single memory of your life

697
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:15,083
before we met on the Promenade?

698
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:23,272
Benjamin, I'm so frightened.

699
00:38:24,745 --> 00:38:26,715
Nidell's dying, Fenna.

700
00:38:26,749 --> 00:38:29,083
She only has a few hours.

701
00:38:31,659 --> 00:38:34,756
What happens to me if she dies?

702
00:38:34,798 --> 00:38:37,736
You no longer exist without her.

703
00:38:37,771 --> 00:38:39,764
But you can save her.

704
00:38:39,808 --> 00:38:43,407
Give her back the life
she gave to you.

705
00:38:44,752 --> 00:38:46,243
I don't know how.

706
00:38:46,288 --> 00:38:48,281
You can go back to her.

707
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,696
I've seen you do it,
three times.

708
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,872
But even if she lives,
then I die

709
00:38:58,914 --> 00:39:02,353
and everything that you
and I have dies with me.

710
00:39:02,387 --> 00:39:04,653
Fenna...

711
00:39:09,068 --> 00:39:11,061
what we have is a dream.

712
00:39:11,105 --> 00:39:14,909
I wouldn't trade it
for anything

713
00:39:14,946 --> 00:39:18,385
but it's still just a dream...

714
00:39:18,419 --> 00:39:20,514
Nidell's dream.

715
00:39:20,557 --> 00:39:23,791
And she won't remember
any of it, will she?

716
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:27,030
There's no way to be sure.

717
00:39:28,773 --> 00:39:31,574
I love you, Benjamin

718
00:39:31,612 --> 00:39:33,844
and I always will.

719
00:39:38,961 --> 00:39:42,456
Commander, you'd better come
to the Bridge right away.

720
00:39:45,975 --> 00:39:46,943
What is it?

721
00:39:46,977 --> 00:39:48,445
It's Seyetik.

722
00:39:48,479 --> 00:39:51,246
He's launched the shuttlepod
toward Epsilon 119

723
00:39:51,285 --> 00:39:52,514
and he's onboard.

724
00:39:52,554 --> 00:39:54,319
On my way.

725
00:39:58,166 --> 00:39:59,395
He's opening a channel.

726
00:39:59,434 --> 00:40:00,459
On screen.

727
00:40:01,539 --> 00:40:03,270
I hope this transmitter
is working.

728
00:40:03,309 --> 00:40:06,145
I'd hate to go to all this
trouble without an audience.

729
00:40:06,182 --> 00:40:08,209
Professor, you'll be killed.

730
00:40:08,252 --> 00:40:09,949
What do you think you're doing?

731
00:40:09,989 --> 00:40:11,754
Making history.

732
00:40:11,792 --> 00:40:15,459
You might want to record this
for posterity and all that.

733
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,936
He's about 60 seconds
from impact.

734
00:40:17,972 --> 00:40:20,442
Gideon, you don't
have to do this.

735
00:40:20,476 --> 00:40:22,708
We found a way to save Nidell.

736
00:40:22,747 --> 00:40:25,310
I had a feeling you would,
Commander.

737
00:40:25,353 --> 00:40:28,884
But this is the only way
I can really set her free

738
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,793
and I owe her that.

739
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:33,461
Besides, this'll be
my crowning achievement.

740
00:40:33,502 --> 00:40:36,372
Remember <i>The Fall of Kang?</i>

741
00:40:36,408 --> 00:40:39,744
Well, this is one warrior
who refuses to be pitied.

742
00:40:39,781 --> 00:40:41,375
What's he talking about?

743
00:40:41,418 --> 00:40:42,477
Klingon poetry.

744
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,046
30 seconds from impact.

745
00:40:44,091 --> 00:40:47,826
Gideon, I want you to turn
the shuttlepod around now.

746
00:40:47,864 --> 00:40:48,832
That's an order.

747
00:40:48,866 --> 00:40:50,095
Too late, Commander.

748
00:40:50,136 --> 00:40:52,402
I've already entered
the gravity well of the star.

749
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,433
Engage the tractor beam.

750
00:40:54,478 --> 00:40:55,844
He disabled it before he left.

751
00:40:55,947 --> 00:40:57,644
Commander, when all this is over

752
00:40:57,684 --> 00:40:59,620
you'll find a case
among my personal belongings.

753
00:40:59,655 --> 00:41:01,522
There's something in there
I want you to find.

754
00:41:01,558 --> 00:41:02,787
What is it?

755
00:41:02,894 --> 00:41:04,488
My obituary.

756
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:07,530
I wrote it myself.

757
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:09,904
After all, I couldn't leave
such an important document

758
00:41:09,942 --> 00:41:11,137
to some stranger.

759
00:41:11,178 --> 00:41:12,909
Do me a favor,
and see that it's sent

760
00:41:12,948 --> 00:41:15,647
to the Daystrom Institute
for publication, huh?

761
00:41:15,687 --> 00:41:17,121
You have my word.

762
00:41:17,157 --> 00:41:18,523
Oh, which reminds me

763
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:21,929
I didn't get a chance
to update it before I left.

764
00:41:21,966 --> 00:41:23,332
Let the record state

765
00:41:23,369 --> 00:41:26,830
that he sacrificed himself
on the altar of science.

766
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:27,774
Ten seconds.

767
00:41:27,811 --> 00:41:30,476
I'll be sure they get it.

768
00:41:30,516 --> 00:41:32,281
I'm sure I can count on you.

769
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,290
Five seconds.

770
00:41:34,324 --> 00:41:37,421
Keep your eye
on the viewscreen, Commander.

771
00:41:37,464 --> 00:41:39,559
You'll never see
anything like this again.

772
00:41:39,601 --> 00:41:41,264
Let there be light!

773
00:42:23,322 --> 00:42:25,622
Station Log, supplemental.

774
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:28,655
Epsilon 119 continues
to burn brightly...

775
00:42:28,699 --> 00:42:31,671
a fitting memorial
to a brilliant man.

776
00:42:31,705 --> 00:42:34,005
Meanwhile, I'm happy to report

777
00:42:34,043 --> 00:42:36,810
Nidell has made
a complete recovery.

778
00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:41,791
Unfortunately, she has no memory
of Fenna's experiences.

779
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:42,952
Commander.

780
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,795
Nidell.

781
00:42:46,835 --> 00:42:48,828
How did you know I was here?

782
00:42:48,873 --> 00:42:51,139
Lieutenant Dax told me.

783
00:42:51,178 --> 00:42:53,945
So...

784
00:42:53,983 --> 00:42:56,078
when does the <i>Prometheus</i> leave?

785
00:42:56,121 --> 00:42:58,786
Soon.

786
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:01,696
I just wanted to say
good-bye and thank you.

787
00:43:01,732 --> 00:43:04,202
It'll be good to get home.

788
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:09,575
How long do you plan
on staying on New Halana?

789
00:43:09,614 --> 00:43:11,607
For the rest of my life.

790
00:43:11,652 --> 00:43:14,351
I've been gone
too long as it is.

791
00:43:26,381 --> 00:43:29,012
I wish that I could
remember Fenna.

792
00:43:30,256 --> 00:43:32,385
What she did...

793
00:43:32,427 --> 00:43:34,294
how she felt.

794
00:43:34,331 --> 00:43:36,962
But I can't.
I'm sorry.

795
00:43:37,069 --> 00:43:38,698
It's all right.

796
00:43:38,739 --> 00:43:42,109
I can remember for both of us.

797
00:43:44,083 --> 00:43:45,643
Tell me one thing.

798
00:43:45,686 --> 00:43:47,212
If I can.

799
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:51,256
What was she like?

800
00:43:51,298 --> 00:43:52,824
Fenna?

801
00:44:01,485 --> 00:44:04,286
She was just like you.
