SISKO:
<i>Personal Log,</i>

2
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:07,716
<i>Stardate 47329.4.</i>

3
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:10,678
<i>I finally realized</i>
<i>why I've had trouble sleeping</i>

4
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:12,220
<i>the last few nights.</i>

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,014
<i>Yesterday was</i>
<i>the fourth anniversary</i>

6
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,558
<i>of the massacre at Wolf 359...</i>

7
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:19,728
<i>the fourth anniversary</i>
<i>of Jennifer's death.</i>

8
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,814
<i>I'm not sure</i>
<i>what bothers me more--</i>

9
00:00:21,814 --> 00:00:23,440
<i>the date itself</i>

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,151
<i>or the fact that it almost</i>
<i>passed unnoticed.</i>

11
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:34,201
Dad, what are
you doing up?

12
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:37,287
I was about to ask you
the same thing.

13
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:39,623
I-I had a weird dream.

14
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:42,334
Get some hot chocolate
and tell me about it.

15
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:45,671
Nah, it's nothing.

16
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:47,673
Ah, come on.

17
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:50,718
Tell me about
this weird dream.

18
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:51,969
It's stupid.

19
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,679
Maybe so.

20
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,264
But the thing
about dreams is

21
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,474
if you talk about them

22
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,393
they kind of
go away faster.

23
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,395
Okay, but don't laugh.

24
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:02,813
I promise.

25
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,319
I don't know, I was...

26
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,031
I was on the station somewhere--

27
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:14,157
I'm not sure where--

28
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,493
and I was trying
to get back here

29
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,663
but I couldn't...
I couldn't find my way.

30
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:23,083
I mean, every time I saw
a familiar corridor

31
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,461
it kind of led
into some other direction.

32
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,839
See, I told you
it was stupid.

33
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:31,299
You got me interested.

34
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,552
Well, then...

35
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:35,763
I guess I got
a little scared

36
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:38,181
and started
looking for you.

37
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:41,226
But I couldn't find you.

38
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,771
Some... Somehow
I ended up in Ops

39
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,272
but you weren't
in your...

40
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,815
you weren't
in your office.

41
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,860
And... and then
it was like...

42
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,446
like the floor
started sloping

43
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,907
and... and I couldn't
keep my balance.

44
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:57,451
And all I wanted to do
was find you.

45
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:00,662
And here I am.

46
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:05,876
Dad, I... I love you.

47
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:08,420
I love you, too.

48
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,971
Oh, I have a calculus test
in the morning.

49
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:19,723
Then you better
get some sleep.

50
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:20,975
Yeah.

51
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,106
Dad?

52
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:28,816
Hmm?

53
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,442
I miss her.

54
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:33,612
Me, too.

55
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,730
(<i> sighs</i> )

56
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,190
Beautiful,
aren't they?

57
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,611
I don't think
I've seen the stars

58
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,155
shine so brightly.

59
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,827
The Bajorans call
that constellation

60
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,495
"the Runners."

61
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:25,246
I can never figure out

62
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:28,375
if they're running
toward something

63
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,460
or away from something.

64
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,005
Does that matter?

65
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:36,133
Sometimes it just
feels good to run.

66
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,760
I never thought about it
that way.

67
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,309
I'm Benjamin Sisko,
Commander of this station.

68
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,311
I'm...

69
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,271
Fenna.

70
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,985
I'm sorry,
you must be very busy.

71
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,029
I didn't mean to bother you.

72
00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:59,364
You're not bothering me
at all.

73
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,949
Good.

74
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,703
Commander of
the station.

75
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:06,788
That must be
very exciting--

76
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,124
all those ships
coming and going.

77
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:11,626
Every day must bring
something new.

78
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,379
It has its moments.

79
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,464
In some ways, though

80
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,592
I prefer this
time the best

81
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,469
when everything
is quiet and...

82
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,222
And you can feel

83
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:24,973
a kind of anticipation
in the air

84
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,850
like something wonderful
is going to happen

85
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,103
but you just don't know
what it is.

86
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:30,729
(<i> laughs</i> )

87
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:33,232
I guess that sounds
kind of silly, doesn't it?

88
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:34,858
Not at all.

89
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:37,986
That's one of the great things
about this station.

90
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,405
You never know what's
going to happen next.

91
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,994
Or who you're
going to meet.

92
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,247
I like it here.

93
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,751
I wish I could stay longer.

94
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,711
Where are you going?

95
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:59,133
I'm not really sure.

96
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:05,180
I guess I'll just keep going,
like the Runners.

97
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:09,559
I tell you what.

98
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,853
Before you run any farther

99
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,439
why don't I show you
around the station

100
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,941
if you have the time...?

101
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,366
Fenna?

102
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,745
Good morning, Chief.

103
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:34,913
Morning, Commander.

104
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,456
Is this maintenance
or repair?

105
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,499
Right now,
it's maintenance.

106
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:41,128
Five'll get you ten, it'll be a
repair by the time I'm through.

107
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:42,712
Admit it,
Chief.

108
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,923
If you were on a station
where everything worked

109
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,091
you'd be
miserable.

110
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,301
Well, you may be
right, sir.

111
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:48,802
(<i> loud pop, hissing</i> )

112
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,804
But I'd be willing
to give it a try.

113
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,723
Good morning, Major.

114
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,809
Computer,
one Chiraltan tea

115
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,602
with a double
twist of lemon.

116
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,157
(<i> sighs</i> )

117
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:13,868
Something wrong?

118
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,412
No, nothing.

119
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,080
If something's
bothering you, Major

120
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,206
I want to
hear it.

121
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,499
It's just that...

122
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,959
Every morning
for the last year

123
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,377
I've seen you walk in here

124
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,338
and start your day
with a<i> raktajino.</i>

125
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:25,380
I love<i> raktajino.</i>

126
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,756
I know.
You never even talk

127
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,633
to anyone until you've had
your first cup.

128
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,345
Because I'm not awake
until I've had my first cup.

129
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:32,720
So...

130
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,390
how come you're drinking
Chiraltan tea?

131
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,645
I, uh...

132
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:44,191
I just felt like
having something different.

133
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,776
That is all right with you,
isn't it, Major?

134
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,569
Of course.
You can drink whatever you like.

135
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:49,863
Thank you,
Major.

136
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,324
I appreciate
your support.

137
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:53,908
DAX:
Dax to Sisko.

138
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,410
Go ahead, Lieutenant.

139
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,287
Professor Seyetik
and I are in the Science Lab

140
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,746
if you'd like to meet him.

141
00:08:58,746 --> 00:08:59,789
On my way.

142
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:07,630
Lieutenant,
where's our guest?

143
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,174
Inside the flux
generator.

144
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,675
What? What's he
doing in there?

145
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,968
He could be killed.

146
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,553
Well, that's what
I tried to tell him.

147
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,722
And he went in anyway.

148
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,557
Benjamin, have you ever
met a terraformer?

149
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,933
No, what's that
got to do with it?

150
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,269
You can't tell
a terraformer anything.

151
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,479
It's an amazing talent,

152
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,356
bringing dead
worlds to life,

153
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,024
but humility
and common sense

154
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,276
aren't part of the
job description.

155
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,736
Oh.

156
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:36,159
(<i> whooshing</i> )

157
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,661
(<i> rhythmic humming</i> )

158
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,127
There you go, Lieutenant.

159
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,004
That should increase

160
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:51,132
your generator output
by at least five percent.

161
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,260
Ah, you must be
Commander Sisko.

162
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,344
Gideon Seyetik.

163
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,845
Great pleasure
to meet you, sir.

164
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,097
Professor.

165
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,639
I'm a great admirer
of your work.

166
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,808
Good, a man
of intelligence and taste.

167
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,144
I can see we're going
to get along famously.

168
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,645
(<i> all laughing</i> )

169
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:07,815
My son and I visited
Blue Horizon

170
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,234
on the way to Deep Space 9.

171
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,902
I must say, I was impressed.

172
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:12,404
Of course you were.

173
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:15,198
I created the place,
and even I'm impressed.

174
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:16,866
How did you like
DaVinci Falls?

175
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,410
We didn't get to see them.

176
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,328
We were on the surface
only for a few hours.

177
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:25,333
Oh, Commander, you missed
Blue Horizon's crowning glory.

178
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,502
Imagine water cascading

179
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,963
off cliffs the height
of Mount Everest

180
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,339
thundering through

181
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,508
continuous rainbows

182
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:36,553
straight into an ocean
the color of sapphire wine.

183
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,012
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho!

184
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,432
I'm going to have
to take you there one day.

185
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,476
By God, I wouldn't mind
seeing it again myself.

186
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,603
I may take you up on that.

187
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:45,812
Good, good.

188
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:49,274
But first, Epsilon 119, huh?

189
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:52,152
Yes, I understand the initial
surveys look promising.

190
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,361
Promising?

191
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,737
Why, they look magnificent!

192
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,698
Imagine, reigniting a dead sun

193
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:02,454
bringing new life
to an entire solar system.

194
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:04,038
Next to that,
terraforming planets

195
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,999
will seem like child's play.

196
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,375
Let's hope it works.

197
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,544
Right now, it's
a promising theory.

198
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:11,879
Of course it'll work.

199
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,131
I never fail.

200
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:14,966
Well, I did once.

201
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,427
But I found it
didn't agree with
me, so I swore

202
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:20,138
never to do it again,
and I never break my word.

203
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,973
(<i> laughs heartily</i> )

204
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:24,601
Oh, you should be glad you're
coming with me, Lieutenant.

205
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,769
This'll be
my crowning
achievement.

206
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,981
Giving birth to a star.

207
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:32,942
Even I would have a hard time
topping that one.

208
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,660
You're not
going to let

209
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,578
that last piece
of Andorian tuber root

210
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:44,829
go to waste,
are you?

211
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:45,955
Why do you ask?

212
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,248
Because
it's delicious.

213
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,500
May I?

214
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,126
Be my guest.

215
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,379
I'm going to need
the extra calories

216
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,088
to keep up
with Seyetik.

217
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,841
The man works almost
as much as he talks.

218
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:57,800
Benjamin?

219
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,469
What?

220
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,596
Are you looking for someone?

221
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:04,098
I'm sorry, what were you saying?

222
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,850
Uh, nothing important.

223
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,727
I have to meet
with Chief O'Brien.

224
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:11,730
We are boosting
the maximum speed

225
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,234
of Seyetik's ship to warp 9.5.

226
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,696
If his experiment fails
and that sun goes supernova

227
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:20,574
we're going to need
to get out of there fast.

228
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:22,367
I'll see you in Ops.

229
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:48,767
Benjamin...

230
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,646
I was hoping I'd
see you again.

231
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,940
I was just thinking
about you.

232
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,233
Were you really?

233
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,818
I've been thinking
about you, too.

234
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,363
Where did you
disappear to last night?

235
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:01,864
I had to go,
I'm sorry.

236
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,200
I didn't mean to
rush away like that.

237
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,244
Does your invitation
still stand?

238
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,663
To show me around
the station?

239
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:11,124
What would you like
to see?

240
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,126
Everything.

241
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,877
Everything?

242
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,423
That's going to
take some time.

243
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,883
I don't mind
if you don't.

244
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,894
SISKO:
What do you think?

245
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:34,689
It's wonderful.

246
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,483
I'm glad you like it.

247
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,359
You must come here
all the time.

248
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,902
Not really,
but when I do

249
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,614
a ship is usually
blocking the view.

250
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,616
We should have brought
a picnic basket.

251
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:46,200
Here?

252
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,077
What better place?

253
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:52,957
Well, I guess
there is tomorrow.

254
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,751
Is that an
invitation?

255
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,797
Sounded like one
to me.

256
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,966
Then I accept.

257
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,802
Good.

258
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,845
There's plenty left to see.

259
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:09,932
In fact, I doubt that we can
see it all in one evening.

260
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:13,019
Then you can show me the rest
after our picnic tomorrow.

261
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,272
Do you always do that?

262
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,565
Do what?

263
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:20,109
Say exactly
the right thing.

264
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:25,031
Well, no one's ever
told me that before.

265
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,700
There you
go again.

266
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,495
So...

267
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:34,248
tell me all about yourself.

268
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:38,085
There's not much to tell.

269
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,463
Whatever there is,
I want to hear it.

270
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:42,841
I can't.

271
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:44,133
Can't what?

272
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:47,261
I can't tell you.

273
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,596
Why not?

274
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,602
I'm sorry, Benjamin,
but I have to go.

275
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,480
Fenna, wait.

276
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,621
So, then Tiet looked
down at Altrina's lunch

277
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,664
and said, "Klingon food?

278
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,249
Those are worms!"

279
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,752
And Altrina vomited
all over the table!

280
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:22,255
(<i> laughing</i> )

281
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,215
It was pretty
disgusting.

282
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:25,925
That's nice, Jake.

283
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,719
Nice?
She threw up!

284
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:28,845
(<i> giggling</i> )

285
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:29,929
Hmm?

286
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,222
Oh, I'm sorry.

287
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:33,099
I guess I must have
been thinking

288
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,183
about something else.

289
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:37,437
Dad...

290
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,563
are you in love?

291
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,356
What?

292
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,816
You know, with a woman?

293
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:44,235
You're showing
all three of the signs.

294
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:45,445
Signs?

295
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,822
The ones that Nog
told me about:

296
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:52,285
Loss of appetite, daydreaming,
smiling all the time.

297
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:55,288
You've been talking to Nog
about women again?

298
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:59,751
Look, I just want you to know
that if you're in love

299
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:01,753
it's all right with me.

300
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,174
Thanks, Jake.

301
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:09,886
What's she like?

302
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,638
(<i> sighs</i> )

303
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:15,767
She's, uh...<i> really</i>
interesting.

304
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,269
Interesting, huh?

305
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:20,563
So, when do I get to meet her?

306
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:23,817
I think it might be
a little early to do that.

307
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,985
Why? She likes you, too,
doesn't she?

308
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,695
I think so.

309
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:31,157
So, then what's
the problem?

310
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,994
(<i> sighs</i> )

311
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,079
Well, um...

312
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,625
it's just that, uh...

313
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,546
she keeps disappearing.

314
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,180
Above all, stay alert.

315
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,975
If the subspace transmission
I've received is correct

316
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:59,185
and Villus Thed is
en route to the station

317
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,604
I want to be notified
the moment he arrives.

318
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,314
Keep him under
constant surveillance

319
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,358
but remember,
he's a short-range telepath

320
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:08,027
so stay at least five meters
away from him at all times.

321
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,236
That's all.

322
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,280
SECURITY OFFICER:
Yes, sir.

323
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,784
Commander, what
can I do for you?

324
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,664
I need to ask
a favor, Constable.

325
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,499
Of a personal nature.

326
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:22,667
Go on.

327
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:26,086
I'm looking for someone.
A woman.

328
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,047
Name?

329
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,089
Fenna.

330
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,301
First name or last?

331
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,303
I don't know.

332
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,889
Species?

333
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,097
I don't know.

334
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,516
Humanoid.

335
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:41,728
What ship did she arrive on?

336
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,480
I... don't know.

337
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,274
Well...

338
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:50,403
what<i> can</i> you tell me
about her?

339
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,863
Let's see...

340
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:55,658
I'd say she's about
1.6 meters tall...

341
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,994
brown skin...

342
00:17:57,994 --> 00:17:59,954
dark hair.

343
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:03,833
The last time I saw her,
she was wearing a...

344
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,838
She was wearing red.

345
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:12,717
Well, that's something, anyway.

346
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:15,428
Do you think
you can help me?

347
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,097
I don't know.

348
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,807
I need to find her,
Constable.

349
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,642
I think she may be
in some kind of trouble.

350
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,019
What kind
of trouble?

351
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,312
Oh... let me guess.

352
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,314
You don't know.

353
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,235
Well, it's not
much to go on

354
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,112
but I'll do what I can.

355
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,239
I appreciate
your help, Odo.

356
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:44,832
(<i> scoffs</i> )

357
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:51,631
Benjamin, do you
have a minute?

358
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,215
In my office.

359
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,517
What's on
your mind, Dax?

360
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,979
I was hoping you had
something to say to<i> me.</i>

361
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,688
I don't follow you.

362
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,357
You really have
no intention of
telling me, do you?

363
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,525
Telling you what?

364
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,819
Come on, Benjamin!

365
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,862
I saw you with her last night

366
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,363
on the Promenade.

367
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:17,782
What's her name?

368
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,287
Fenna. But believe me, Dax,
there is nothing to talk about.

369
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,372
You used to tell Curzon
everything.

370
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,125
Not<i> everything.</i>

371
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,626
You know what I mean.

372
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:31,337
It's because I'm a
woman now, isn't it?

373
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,380
(<i> cackling</i> ):
Don't be ridiculous!

374
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,799
No, I understand.

375
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,343
It's hard to talk
man-to-man with a woman.

376
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,261
That has nothing
to do with it.

377
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,098
Then tell me
what's going on.

378
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:43,724
I will.

379
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:47,103
As soon as there is
something to tell.

380
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:52,566
SISKO:
<i>Personal Log, supplemental.</i>

381
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:56,195
<i>Odo continues to search for</i>
<i>new information about Fenna.</i>

382
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,740
<i>In the meantime, Professor</i>
<i>Seyetik has invited me</i>

383
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:03,202
<i>and the senior staff to dinner</i>
<i>aboard the</i> Prometheus.

384
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:07,999
A great terraformer needs
the green thumb of a gardener

385
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:11,961
the eye of a painter
and the soul of a poet.

386
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:15,214
And of course, it doesn't hurt
to be a raging egomaniac.

387
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,175
(<i> all laughing</i> )

388
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:19,385
Which makes you
eminently qualified.

389
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:20,887
Of course!

390
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,348
Terraforming is
amazing enough

391
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,350
but I don't understand
how you intend

392
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,935
to reignite a dead sun.

393
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:31,147
Basically, I'll use
a remote piloted shuttlepod

394
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:34,441
to deliver protomatter
into the dead star.

395
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,736
This will cause a cascade effect

396
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,864
which will transform
the star's carbon and oxygen

397
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:42,033
into elemental hydrogen.

398
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:45,369
And then we just stand back
and watch the fireworks.

399
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,871
Of course, if
it doesn't work

400
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,622
it might be the last
thing we ever see.

401
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,166
Oh, come now,
Lieutenant.

402
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,501
Nothing of worth
was ever created by a pessimist.

403
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,087
I don't know
about that.

404
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:55,671
Van Gogh,
Beckett, Y'Raka--

405
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,631
I wouldn't exactly
call them optimists.

406
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,759
Precisely,
and look at
their work--

407
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,344
dark and dreary and dismal.

408
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,890
Art should be
an affirmation of life.

409
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,642
For example, take my own work
in the field.

410
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:12,188
I once saw an exhibit
of your paintings

411
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:15,608
at the Central Gallery
on Ligobis X.

412
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:18,527
They certainly
were memorable.

413
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,614
I don't think I've ever
seen such huge canvases.

414
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:25,618
Doctor, nobody ever accused me
of understatement.

415
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,954
Certainly not anyone
who's ever read
your autobiography.

416
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:29,329
Nine volumes and counting.

417
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,831
(<i> chuckles</i> )

418
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,291
You know, I
always said

419
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,210
I wanted to write
as many books

420
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,087
as I've had marriages.

421
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:38,089
Ah... which reminds me.

422
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:42,468
Wait till you taste the food
my wife has created for you.

423
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,762
None of that
replicated nonsense

424
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:46,639
you're used to, no, no, no.

425
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:52,228
Every dish was prepared entirely
by Nidell's own sweet hands.

426
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,438
I can't wait
to meet her.

427
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,689
And so you shall.

428
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,441
She should be just about ready.

429
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,735
I'll go and get her.

430
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,405
Commander, do you think
he'd notice

431
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,032
if we weren't here
when he got back?

432
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,784
Don't even think
about it, Major.

433
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:09,411
I've had dinner with about
two dozen Bajoran ministers.

434
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,788
I think you owe
me this one.

435
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:12,123
Besides, Seyetik is

436
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:14,750
one of the Federation's
greatest minds.

437
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,752
I know, he told me.

438
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:20,298
Well, I, for one, find him
remarkably entertaining.

439
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:23,050
Ladies and gentlemen

440
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,846
I'd like you to meet my wife
and my inspiration... Nidell.

441
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,648
<i>Now</i> we have something
to talk about.

442
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:47,074
I can't eat
another bite.

443
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,868
That was
delicious.

444
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,828
Do you think
I could have
the recipe?

445
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:53,998
You'll have to ask Gideon.
It's his creation.

446
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:57,626
Well, it took me years
to perfect it.

447
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:00,546
The secret, you see, is to sear

448
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,840
the Kalo roots slightly
before layering them

449
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,675
over the slices
of roasted Waroon.

450
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:06,927
But the most
important...

451
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,305
She acts like
she doesn't recognize me.

452
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,265
...one liter
of clear Rumall stock...

453
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:13,142
It is the same
woman, isn't it?

454
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:15,061
She<i> looks</i> the same.

455
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:16,770
...of Vulcan redspice

456
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,232
half a dozen Humat pods
and a dash of ice salt.

457
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:21,984
And then you reduce it
in an Andorian boiler

458
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:25,071
cook it<i> exactly</i>
500 degrees Kelvin

459
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:28,032
and then you just
pepper to taste.

460
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:33,787
Any questions?
Ah, maybe you should
write that down.

461
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:36,249
(<i> laughter</i> )
Of course.

462
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:38,542
No trouble at all.

463
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,753
Well... I think we should

464
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,130
continue this conversation
in the other room.

465
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,966
We shall be more
comfortable there.

466
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,980
Commander, can I help
you with something?

467
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,774
I hope so.

468
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:05,443
It would have been a lot easier

469
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:07,947
if you'd told me
you were married.

470
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,823
I don't understand.

471
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,075
Yesterday...

472
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:12,659
on the Promenade...

473
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,995
you had plenty of opportunity.

474
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:18,207
Commander, I don't know
what you're talking about.

475
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:20,293
I've never met you
before tonight.

476
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:28,175
I suppose you never told me
that your name was Fenna.

477
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:36,392
Would you like
to talk about this?

478
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:38,978
Commander, obviously
you have mistaken me

479
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:40,313
for someone else.

480
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:48,404
Seems that way...

481
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:50,656
doesn't it?

482
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,124
I'm telling you, Dax,
it was the same woman.

483
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:03,252
The face, the voice--
it<i> was</i> Fenna.

484
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:05,754
Maybe you have to
talk to her when her
husband isn't around.

485
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,547
Dax, she's a
married woman.

486
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,883
That would have never
stopped Curzon.

487
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:13,262
It's just that this
was the first time

488
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:17,850
since Jennifer's death that
I felt... drawn to someone.

489
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,977
ODO:
Commander, may I have
a word with you?

490
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,482
I thought
you should know

491
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:27,525
I've checked this week's
docking and transporter logs

492
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:29,445
and there is no record

493
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:32,239
of anyone matching
the description you gave me.

494
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,824
Thanks, Odo.

495
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:36,118
But you can call
off your search.

496
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:37,995
I've already found the
woman I was looking for.

497
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:39,746
You did?

498
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:43,042
And where was she,
if you don't mind my asking?

499
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,751
Aboard the<i> Prometheus.</i>

500
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:46,045
The<i> Prometheus?</i>

501
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,505
Are you sure?

502
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:49,340
Yes, we just left there
a few minutes ago.

503
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,924
That's impossible.

504
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,468
What do you mean?

505
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:56,222
I checked the de-embarkation
logs as part of my search.

506
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:58,891
With the exception
of Professor Seyetik

507
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:01,060
no one has left
the<i> Prometheus</i>

508
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,397
during the entire time
it's been at the station.

509
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,322
QUARK:
Commander...

510
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:15,782
I thought you
could use this.

511
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:18,160
No thanks, I was
just leaving.

512
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,662
Stood you up,
didn't she?

513
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:23,374
When you've worked
in a bar as long as I have

514
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:25,167
you get to recognize
that look.

515
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:27,627
I've even seen it
in the mirror once or twice.

516
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:30,172
I'd better be getting home.

517
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:31,424
If you like

518
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:34,385
we could go down
to the bar and talk...

519
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:36,095
you know, about women.

520
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:38,431
I don't think so.

521
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,642
Don't forget...

522
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:46,105
the holosuites are always open.

523
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,162
FENNA:
Benjamin!

524
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,626
I missed you.

525
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,090
Is there
something wrong?

526
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,425
I just had dinner

527
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:16,927
with someone who looks
exactly like you.

528
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,972
Like me?

529
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:21,307
How strange.

530
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,936
You're telling me

531
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:28,564
that your name
isn't really Nidell

532
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:31,649
and you're not the wife
of Gideon Seyetik?

533
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:33,110
Of course not.

534
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,028
I'm Fenna.
You know that.

535
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:37,781
Right now, I'm not
sure<i> what</i> I know.

536
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:43,120
I don't suppose you have
a twin sister, do you?

537
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,663
Not that I know of.

538
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:48,708
Fenna...

539
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:51,753
I need to know
where you came from

540
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:54,423
and what you're doing
on this station.

541
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,634
Does that matter?

542
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:00,846
Of course it matters.

543
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:08,103
I need to know who you are.

544
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:17,779
You do know me, Benjamin.

545
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:23,076
When I came here,
I thought I was looking
for a place--

546
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:26,455
somewhere I belonged--
but I was wrong.

547
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:31,835
I wasn't looking for a place;
I was looking for a person.

548
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,795
I was looking for you.

549
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:02,241
Benjamin...

550
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:11,417
(<i> groans</i> )

551
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:23,554
All right, Lieutenant.

552
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:25,264
I've got the warp drive
on the<i> Prometheus</i>

553
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:26,806
purring like a kitten.

554
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,434
It'll do 9.6 in a pinch

555
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:30,018
but I wouldn't take it
any faster.

556
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,604
I thought the
theoretical maximum

557
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:34,231
for those engines
was warp 9.5.

558
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:36,108
CHIEF: Well, it was.
Must I remind you,
Lieutenant

559
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:39,069
some of us have
only one lifetime?

560
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:40,362
I'll be right there.

561
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,742
Good luck, Lieutenant.

562
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:46,826
Commander.

563
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:48,787
Come to see us off,
Benjamin?

564
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,748
Not exactly-- I'm
going with you.

565
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:52,583
How often do you
get a chance

566
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:54,126
to see a star reborn?

567
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,169
Do you really think
this is a good idea?

568
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,755
I need answers, Dax.

569
00:29:57,755 --> 00:30:00,299
And the key to
Fenna's disappearance

570
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,634
may be on that ship.

571
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:17,190
Have you finished loading

572
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,777
the protomatter device
into the shuttle pod?

573
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:22,321
All set.
The containment fields
are holding fine.

574
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:24,197
Remote guidance systems
are fully operational.

575
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,949
SEYETIK:
I'm telling you,
Commander

576
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:28,619
by the time I was through
with New Halana

577
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:30,454
it was a veritable paradise.

578
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:32,289
How are we doing,
Mr. Piersall?

579
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:34,874
We'll be initiating
preliminary scans
in a few hours.

580
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:37,252
Well, let me know
when we get there.

581
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,462
Well, Professor

582
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:40,464
you must be eager
to get started.

583
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:42,048
What did you
call this?

584
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,676
Your crowning
achievement.

585
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:45,511
Ah, don't remind me.

586
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:47,887
Commander, my entire life

587
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:51,600
has been a series
of escalating triumphs.

588
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,435
It's what I live for...

589
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:55,145
knowing that no matter
what I achieve

590
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:57,356
there's always another
triumph waiting for me.

591
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:59,107
And now?

592
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,400
Well...

593
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,152
Are you familiar

594
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:04,780
with the Klingon
poet G'Trok?

595
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,406
A little.

596
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,575
<i>The Fall of Kang</i> is required
reading at the Academy.

597
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,744
Ah...
(<i> clears throat</i> )

598
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:12,454
"So honor the valiant

599
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,373
who die 'neath
your sword..."

600
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:17,125
"But pity the warrior
who slays all his foes."

601
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,544
Well...

602
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:20,170
yes, well...

603
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:22,339
a bit obvious perhaps

604
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:25,008
but true nonetheless.

605
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,301
(<i> sighing</i> )

606
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:29,763
So, what were we
talking about?
You.

607
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:33,225
Ha! Of course.
My favorite subject.
Where was I?

608
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,935
You had just finished
terraforming New Halana.

609
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:36,978
Ah, of course.

610
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,355
Well, you can imagine

611
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:40,273
how grateful
the New Halanans were.

612
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:44,486
Endless parades
and receptions and...

613
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:47,447
Got to be a bit
of a bore, actually.

614
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:50,492
But then I... I met Nidell.

615
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:53,036
She was the daughter
of a local dignitary

616
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:56,998
and she was utterly infatuated
with me from the very start.

617
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:59,793
Well, I-I can't say
I blame her, actually.

618
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:01,378
The first time
she saw me

619
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:03,756
I was surrounded
by crowds of people

620
00:32:03,756 --> 00:32:08,635
unveiling a statue
they'd commissioned
in my honor.

621
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:11,680
Well, I could...
I could tell from the start

622
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,600
she was something special.

623
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,810
You know,
she'd never been off-world

624
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,812
before she met me.

625
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:22,232
I promised to show her
the galaxy.

626
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:26,111
I would have given it
to her if I could have.

627
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:29,155
She must love you very much.

628
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:31,658
She does, Commander.

629
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:36,872
Don't ask me why, but...

630
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:39,541
she does.

631
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:54,973
Fenna!

632
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,100
Benjamin, I'm so glad
to see you.

633
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:01,939
Dax, report to my quarters
immediately.

634
00:33:01,939 --> 00:33:03,315
DAX:
On my way.

635
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,358
Benjamin, what's wrong?

636
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:08,069
The last time I saw you...

637
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:09,822
you vanished.

638
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:13,325
I'm with you now, and I'm never
going to leave you again.

639
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:16,578
I wish I could believe that.

640
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:22,542
You have to, Benjamin.

641
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:26,797
Dax, this is Fenna.

642
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:30,467
What is she doing?

643
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:31,885
It's all right.

644
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:33,178
She's not going to hurt you.

645
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:37,891
I'm not reading
any cellular structure.

646
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:39,267
No DNA patterns.

647
00:33:41,854 --> 00:33:43,355
Just pure energy.

648
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:46,441
Benjamin, what is
she talking about?

649
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:49,528
I think it's time
we find out.

650
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:03,542
Help her.
She won't wake up!

651
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:12,467
She's in shock.

652
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,302
Her respiration is shallow.

653
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:17,014
Her heartbeat
is irregular
and falling.

654
00:34:17,014 --> 00:34:19,140
Her blood pressure's dropping.

655
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,642
Benjamin,
she's dying.

656
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:22,561
But you've got to do something!

657
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,771
I don't know that I can.

658
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:28,107
Fenna!

659
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:30,527
I should have known.

660
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,536
But you<i> can't</i> be here!

661
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:42,080
Nidell promised me
you'd never come back.

662
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:45,625
I don't know
what you're talking about.

663
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,210
Just look at her!

664
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,229
She looks like me.

665
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,814
Of course she looks like you!

666
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,524
She<i> is</i> you-- the real you.

667
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:10,609
SISKO:
Professor

668
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,069
what the hell is going on here?

669
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:14,654
That thing over there
isn't real.

670
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,197
She's an illusion

671
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,992
created by my wife's
unconscious mind.

672
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:20,368
That's not true!

673
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,662
Benjamin, you know
that he's lying.

674
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:25,540
Nidell is
a psychoprojective telepath.

675
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,794
Fenna's just another one
of her projections.

676
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:30,295
Lieutenant?

677
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:32,714
I've never seen readings
like these.

678
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,633
Her occipital lobe
is giving off

679
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,051
enormous amounts
of energy.

680
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:37,803
I don't see
how she could survive

681
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:39,763
more than an hour or two
like this.

682
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:40,931
But she's dying!

683
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:42,474
You've got to do something!

684
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:44,601
There's nothing I can do.

685
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:48,939
Get Fenna
to my quarters, Dax.
And notify Lieutenant...

686
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:50,023
No!

687
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,651
Get her out of here, Dax.

688
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:54,111
Benjamin, I want
to stay with you.

689
00:35:54,111 --> 00:35:55,654
It will be
all right, Fenna.

690
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:58,197
I just need to talk
to Professor Seyetik, here.

691
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:03,912
All right, Professor,
if what you're saying is true,

692
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:06,247
Nidell's psychoprojective
abilities are killing her

693
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:07,791
and I need to know why.

694
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,517
Nidell doesn't even
know this is happening.

695
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,688
In times of deep
emotional distress

696
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,606
Halanans sometimes...

697
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:35,068
lose control of
these abilities.

698
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:37,403
My wife is very...

699
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:40,032
emotionally
distraught.

700
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:45,537
Oh, this happened once before,
three years ago on Terosa Prime.

701
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:49,082
It nearly killed her then.

702
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:52,544
She swore to me
it would never happen again.

703
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:54,087
Obviously...

704
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:58,466
it has.

705
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:03,889
You may have noticed, Commander,
that I tend to evoke

706
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:06,599
strong emotions
from people

707
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,476
particularly
my wives.

708
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:12,105
Oh, they all start out
loving me, but...

709
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:16,401
a few years of togetherness
soon cure them of that.

710
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,656
The others all had
the good sense to leave me.

711
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,744
But why can't Nidell?

712
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,913
What keeps her with you?

713
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:31,166
Halanans mate for life.

714
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:36,046
She can never leave me

715
00:37:36,046 --> 00:37:39,340
no matter how much
she might want to.

716
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,646
Benjamin,
I've never seen

717
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:54,898
Seyetik or that
woman before.

718
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:56,649
I don't know
why he's saying

719
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,777
those things about
me, but they're lies.

720
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:01,279
I'm as real
as you are.

721
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,949
Oh, how I want
to believe that.

722
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:06,659
But can you tell me
where you came from?

723
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,536
How you got
to this station?

724
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,621
Can you tell me

725
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,706
a single memory
of your life

726
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,875
before we met
on the Promenade?

727
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:21,591
Oh, Benjamin, I'm
so frightened.

728
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:26,345
Nidell's dying,
Fenna.

729
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:28,598
She only has
a few hours.

730
00:38:31,143 --> 00:38:34,062
What happens to me
if she dies?

731
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:37,440
You no longer exist
without her.

732
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,400
But you can save her.

733
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,988
Give her back the life
she gave to you.

734
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:45,740
I don't know how.

735
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,993
You can go
back to her.

736
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:51,079
I've seen you do it,
three times.

737
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:58,503
But even if she
lives, then I die

738
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:01,881
and everything that you
and I have dies with me.

739
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:04,009
Fenna...

740
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,765
what we have is a dream.

741
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:13,310
I wouldn't trade it
for anything

742
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:17,396
but it's still
just a dream--

743
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,565
Nidell's dream.

744
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:23,402
And she won't remember
any of it, will she?

745
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:26,281
There's no way
to be sure.

746
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,743
I love you, Benjamin

747
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,038
and I always will.

748
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:42,047
DAX:
Commander, you'd better come
to the Bridge right away.

749
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:46,509
What is it?

750
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,094
It's Seyetik.

751
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:50,680
He's launched the shuttlepod
toward Epsilon 119

752
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,098
and he's onboard.

753
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,558
On my way.

754
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:59,605
He's opening
a channel.
On screen.

755
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,608
I hope this transmitter
is working.

756
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:05,153
I'd hate to go to all this
trouble without an audience.

757
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:07,280
PIERSALL:
Professor,
you'll be killed.

758
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,032
What do you think
you're doing?

759
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:10,909
Making history.

760
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:14,537
You might want to record this
for posterity and all that.

761
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:17,790
He's about 60 seconds
from impact.

762
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:21,711
Gideon, you don't
have to do this.
We found a way to save Nidell.

763
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:24,589
I had a feeling you would,
Commander.

764
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:28,093
But this is the only way
I can really set her free

765
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:29,886
and I owe her that.

766
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:32,555
Besides, this'll be
my crowning achievement.

767
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:35,600
Remember<i> The Fall of Kang?</i>

768
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,853
Well, this is one warrior
who refuses to be pitied.

769
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,479
What's he
talking about?

770
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:41,564
Klingon poetry.

771
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,233
30 seconds
from impact.

772
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:46,986
Gideon, I want you to turn
the shuttlepod around now.

773
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:47,987
That's an order.

774
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,614
Too late, Commander.

775
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,490
I've already entered
the gravity well of the star.

776
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,492
Engage the tractor beam.

777
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:55,120
He disabled it before he left.

778
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,871
Commander, when all this is over

779
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,831
you'll find a case
among my personal belongings.

780
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:00,583
There's something in there
I want you to find.

781
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,001
What is it?

782
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,502
My obituary.

783
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:04,921
(<i> laughs</i> )

784
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:06,798
I wrote it myself.

785
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:09,134
After all, I couldn't leave
such an important document

786
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:10,427
to some stranger.

787
00:41:10,427 --> 00:41:12,053
Do me a favor,
and see that it's sent

788
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:14,806
to the Daystrom Institute
for publication, huh?

789
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:16,391
You have my word.

790
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,059
Oh, which reminds me

791
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:20,937
I didn't get a chance
to update it before I left.

792
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:22,605
Let the record state

793
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:25,900
that he sacrificed himself
on the altar of science.

794
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,901
Ten seconds.

795
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,528
I'll be sure they get it.

796
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:31,323
I'm sure I can count on you.

797
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:33,491
Five seconds.

798
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,952
Keep your eye
on the viewscreen, Commander.

799
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:38,663
You'll never see
anything like this again.

800
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:40,332
Let there be light!

801
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:24,167
SISKO:
<i>Station Log, supplemental.</i>

802
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:27,628
<i>Epsilon 119 continues</i>
<i>to burn brightly--</i>

803
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:30,882
<i>a fitting memorial</i>
<i>to a brilliant man.</i>

804
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:33,301
<i>Meanwhile, I'm happy to report</i>

805
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:35,470
<i>Nidell has made</i>
<i>a complete recovery.</i>

806
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:38,515
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>she has no memory</i>

807
00:42:38,515 --> 00:42:41,059
<i>of Fenna's experiences.</i>

808
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,268
Commander.

809
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:46,022
Nidell.

810
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:48,107
How did you know I was here?

811
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,193
Lieutenant Dax told me.

812
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:53,238
So...

813
00:42:53,238 --> 00:42:55,365
when does the<i> Prometheus</i> leave?

814
00:42:55,365 --> 00:42:58,201
Soon.

815
00:42:58,201 --> 00:43:00,578
I just wanted to say
good-bye and thank you.

816
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,955
It'll be good
to get home.

817
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:08,836
How long do you plan on
staying on New Halana?

818
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,796
For the rest of my life.

819
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:13,550
I've been gone
too long as it is.

820
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:28,106
I wish that I could
remember Fenna.

821
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:33,111
What she did...
how she felt.

822
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,738
But I can't.
I'm sorry.

823
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,656
It's all right.

824
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:40,034
I can remember
for both of us.

825
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:45,664
Tell me one thing.
If I can.

826
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:50,044
What was she like?

827
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,087
Fenna?

828
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,098
She was just like you.
