1
00:00:03,365 --> 00:00:07,169
I am truly impressed,
and I'm not easily impressed.

2
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:10,040
In all my years as the
proprietor of Quark's Bar

3
00:00:10,078 --> 00:00:12,048
Grill, Gaming House
and Holosuite Arcade

4
00:00:12,082 --> 00:00:16,045
I have never seen such a glowing
employee performance report.

5
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:19,029
I mean, look at this.

6
00:00:19,063 --> 00:00:22,058
In three months,
no customer has filed

7
00:00:22,102 --> 00:00:24,334
a single complaint against you.

8
00:00:24,373 --> 00:00:28,108
You haven't spilled a drink,
mixed up a food order

9
00:00:28,148 --> 00:00:29,913
or shortchanged a bill.

10
00:00:29,951 --> 00:00:33,082
I take my job very seriously.

11
00:00:33,124 --> 00:00:35,721
And, yet, you always manage
to wear a friendly smile.

12
00:00:35,763 --> 00:00:38,029
That's because I like my work.

13
00:00:38,068 --> 00:00:39,594
I'm happy to be here.

14
00:00:39,638 --> 00:00:41,505
And it shows.

15
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,172
The customers love you.

16
00:00:44,213 --> 00:00:46,581
Your fellow dabo girls
love you.

17
00:00:46,618 --> 00:00:48,952
Even the Ferengi waiters
sing your praises

18
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:50,014
and you know why?

19
00:00:50,058 --> 00:00:51,823
Because you're nice.

20
00:00:51,862 --> 00:00:54,332
I try to be.

21
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,701
You're nice to the customers.

22
00:00:57,741 --> 00:00:59,938
You're nice to the dabo girls.

23
00:00:59,978 --> 00:01:02,973
You're nice
to the Ferengi waiters.

24
00:01:03,986 --> 00:01:05,512
You're nice to everyone...

25
00:01:06,592 --> 00:01:08,562
almost everyone.

26
00:01:09,598 --> 00:01:11,431
You mean, I've offended someone?

27
00:01:11,467 --> 00:01:13,767
Look closely, Aluura.

28
00:01:13,806 --> 00:01:16,778
Can't you see
the pain in my eyes?

29
00:01:16,812 --> 00:01:18,679
But I'm always nice to you.

30
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:22,421
I think you could be nicer.

31
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:25,152
How much nicer?

32
00:01:34,815 --> 00:01:37,878
Oo-mox <i>for Fun and Profit?</i>

33
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:39,412
It's a quick read.

34
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:43,289
Oh...

35
00:01:43,331 --> 00:01:46,132
you... want me to be...

36
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,833
nice.

37
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:49,308
Let's face it.

38
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,075
The customers, the dabo
girls, the Ferengi waiters...

39
00:01:52,115 --> 00:01:53,812
they didn't hire you

40
00:01:53,853 --> 00:01:55,584
and, uh...

41
00:01:55,623 --> 00:01:57,718
they can't fire you.

42
00:02:00,365 --> 00:02:02,096
You wouldn't.

43
00:02:05,743 --> 00:02:06,768
Would you?

44
00:02:06,812 --> 00:02:08,110
Read the book.

45
00:02:09,216 --> 00:02:10,275
Brother...

46
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,616
we need to talk.

47
00:02:11,655 --> 00:02:12,816
Go away.

48
00:02:12,857 --> 00:02:13,950
I'm in the middle of a meeting.

49
00:02:13,993 --> 00:02:15,018
But it's important.

50
00:02:15,061 --> 00:02:16,495
So is this meeting.

51
00:02:16,531 --> 00:02:18,057
It's about our mother.

52
00:02:19,403 --> 00:02:20,462
How many times have I told you

53
00:02:20,505 --> 00:02:23,909
not to mention Moogie
when I'm... working?

54
00:02:23,946 --> 00:02:24,914
Sorry

55
00:02:24,948 --> 00:02:26,941
but I tried contacting
her this morning

56
00:02:26,985 --> 00:02:28,283
and I couldn't get through.

57
00:02:28,321 --> 00:02:31,054
She's probably off
visiting the Grand Nagus.

58
00:02:31,093 --> 00:02:32,254
I tried the Tower of Commerce.

59
00:02:32,296 --> 00:02:33,594
There was no answer
there either.

60
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:35,328
They're probably on vacation.

61
00:02:35,402 --> 00:02:36,893
Now, leave me alone.

62
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:37,964
I'm trying to concentrate.

63
00:02:38,007 --> 00:02:39,704
Brother, you don't understand.

64
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,338
I can't get a hold of
anyone on Ferenginar...

65
00:02:41,414 --> 00:02:43,247
not Cousin Gaila, not Lek.

66
00:02:43,284 --> 00:02:44,752
I tell you, something's
very wrong.

67
00:02:44,788 --> 00:02:46,051
All right.

68
00:02:48,261 --> 00:02:49,890
We will continue this later.

69
00:02:49,931 --> 00:02:52,869
In the meantime,
you have some reading to do.

70
00:02:52,904 --> 00:02:54,270
Hello, Aluura.

71
00:02:57,245 --> 00:02:58,736
She's so nice.

72
00:03:00,619 --> 00:03:02,087
We'll see.

73
00:03:04,426 --> 00:03:06,623
A Dominion invasion
of Ferenginar?

74
00:03:06,664 --> 00:03:08,030
Think of the terrible
repercussions

75
00:03:08,067 --> 00:03:09,764
to the Alpha Quadrant.

76
00:03:09,804 --> 00:03:11,102
I cannot think of any.

77
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,973
How could the Dominion
invade Ferenginar

78
00:03:13,011 --> 00:03:15,106
without first conquering
the surrounding systems

79
00:03:15,148 --> 00:03:17,277
like Clarus and Irtok?

80
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:18,514
Brother, did you hear that?

81
00:03:18,554 --> 00:03:20,649
They've captured Irtok, as well.

82
00:03:20,692 --> 00:03:22,355
That's not what I said.

83
00:03:22,396 --> 00:03:23,922
There are no reports
of Dominion activity

84
00:03:23,966 --> 00:03:25,936
anywhere near that sector.

85
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,370
Why can't we get through
to Ferenginar?

86
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:29,932
Moogie, the Nagus,
Cousin Gaila...

87
00:03:29,978 --> 00:03:31,139
they're all dead.

88
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,173
You don't know that,
Rom, but something

89
00:03:33,217 --> 00:03:35,517
is definitely wrong
on Ferenginar.

90
00:03:35,555 --> 00:03:36,989
We'll see
what we can find out.

91
00:03:37,025 --> 00:03:38,050
Captain

92
00:03:38,094 --> 00:03:39,893
a Ferengi ship is
approaching the station

93
00:03:39,931 --> 00:03:41,764
requesting permission
to dock.

94
00:03:41,802 --> 00:03:43,635
It's Grand Nagus Zek...

95
00:03:43,671 --> 00:03:45,800
and your mother is with him.

96
00:03:45,843 --> 00:03:47,813
They're alive!

97
00:03:48,816 --> 00:03:50,410
Nice work.

98
00:04:04,012 --> 00:04:05,344
Quark, Rom!

99
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:08,046
It's good to see you boys.

100
00:04:08,087 --> 00:04:10,752
It's good to see you,
too, Nagus.

101
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:12,227
Come along, my dear.

102
00:04:15,235 --> 00:04:17,866
Moogie...

103
00:04:19,778 --> 00:04:21,338
I was so worried.

104
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,043
You're a good son.

105
00:04:23,084 --> 00:04:24,610
I was worried, too.

106
00:04:24,653 --> 00:04:26,087
And you're a good liar.

107
00:04:26,123 --> 00:04:28,559
Moogie, do you think
it's a good idea

108
00:04:28,594 --> 00:04:30,689
to be wearing
clothes in public?

109
00:04:30,732 --> 00:04:32,030
He's right.

110
00:04:32,068 --> 00:04:35,165
What if one
of my Ferengi waiters sees you?

111
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,871
I hope they do.

112
00:04:36,912 --> 00:04:38,175
Tell them, Zekkie.

113
00:04:38,214 --> 00:04:39,979
No, you go right ahead,
my dear.

114
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:41,954
No, it should really
come from you.

115
00:04:41,988 --> 00:04:44,049
Would someone please tell me
what's going on?

116
00:04:44,092 --> 00:04:45,060
It's one of those

117
00:04:45,094 --> 00:04:47,895
good news/bad news
type of things.

118
00:04:47,934 --> 00:04:49,232
Give him the good news first.

119
00:04:49,269 --> 00:04:51,205
If you insist.

120
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,472
Three days ago,
I added a new amendment

121
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:55,776
to the Ferengi Bill
of Opportunities

122
00:04:55,816 --> 00:05:00,849
giving females
the right to wear clothes.

123
00:05:00,893 --> 00:05:01,952
In public?

124
00:05:01,995 --> 00:05:03,794
Anywhere we want.

125
00:05:03,832 --> 00:05:07,100
That can't be the good news.

126
00:05:07,138 --> 00:05:10,942
If Ferengi females
can wear clothes in public

127
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,243
then they can leave their homes.

128
00:05:12,282 --> 00:05:14,718
If they can leave their homes,
they can go to work.

129
00:05:14,753 --> 00:05:17,748
If they go to work,
they can make profit.

130
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:19,421
What's the matter, Quark...

131
00:05:19,463 --> 00:05:21,228
afraid of a little competition?

132
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:23,932
Are you sure
that's the good news?

133
00:05:23,972 --> 00:05:25,635
It sounds good to me.

134
00:05:25,675 --> 00:05:28,168
Oh, now you see
why I like him best?

135
00:05:28,214 --> 00:05:31,243
Face it, Quark...
it's good business.

136
00:05:31,287 --> 00:05:35,625
For thousands of years,
Ferenginar has allowed

137
00:05:35,662 --> 00:05:40,160
a valuable resource
to go to waste.

138
00:05:40,204 --> 00:05:43,142
Females...
a valuable resource?

139
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:46,115
They make up 53.5 percent
of the population

140
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,177
and contribute
virtually nothing

141
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,281
to gross planetary income.

142
00:05:50,325 --> 00:05:54,356
I say it's time they started
pulling their own weight.

143
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:56,232
Better tell me the bad news.

144
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,001
It might cheer me up.

145
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,030
I doubt it.

146
00:05:59,076 --> 00:06:01,239
The moment fully clothed females

147
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,446
started appearing
on the streets of Ferenginar

148
00:06:04,486 --> 00:06:07,481
financial chaos erupted
all over the planet.

149
00:06:07,525 --> 00:06:09,893
That explains
the communications blackout.

150
00:06:09,931 --> 00:06:11,491
There was so much
buying and selling

151
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,034
throughout the Alliance

152
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:17,374
that the entire planetary
communications grid shut down.

153
00:06:17,412 --> 00:06:19,245
If there's trouble
on Ferenginar

154
00:06:19,282 --> 00:06:21,184
what are you doing here?

155
00:06:22,655 --> 00:06:25,218
I've been deposed.

156
00:06:25,261 --> 00:06:28,028
I'm no longer Grand Nagus.

157
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:30,766
Then who is?

158
00:06:30,805 --> 00:06:32,604
Who do you think?

159
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:35,547
Brunt.

160
00:06:35,581 --> 00:06:37,141
Grand Nagus Brunt?

161
00:06:37,185 --> 00:06:38,551
Acting Grand Nagus Brunt.

162
00:06:38,654 --> 00:06:40,954
Brother, we're in trouble now.

163
00:06:40,993 --> 00:06:41,961
Brunt hates us.

164
00:06:41,995 --> 00:06:44,090
Well, don't start panicking.

165
00:06:44,132 --> 00:06:46,763
The Ferengi Commerce Authority
hasn't confirmed him yet.

166
00:06:46,804 --> 00:06:50,174
And they won't
for three more days.

167
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:54,447
Boys, together we're going
to reconquer an empire

168
00:06:54,486 --> 00:06:56,683
or die in the attempt!

169
00:09:05,557 --> 00:09:09,018
What lovely quarters
you have, Quark.

170
00:09:09,064 --> 00:09:12,298
Small... but lovely.

171
00:09:12,337 --> 00:09:13,897
As of this moment

172
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,172
I declare this site
to be the headquarters

173
00:09:16,212 --> 00:09:19,480
of the sole legitimate
government of Ferenginar.

174
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:21,283
I still can't believe it.

175
00:09:21,322 --> 00:09:23,758
Brunt is the new Nagus?

176
00:09:23,793 --> 00:09:25,193
Acting Nagus.

177
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,596
For three more days.

178
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:28,032
Then it becomes official.

179
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:29,094
I'm not worried.

180
00:09:29,137 --> 00:09:32,541
I have a secret weapon...
your mother.

181
00:09:33,646 --> 00:09:35,707
Now, here's the plan:

182
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,950
One, we contact
every FCA Commissioner

183
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,860
and invite them to the station
for a meeting.

184
00:09:41,896 --> 00:09:45,300
Two, Ishka runs the meeting.

185
00:09:45,336 --> 00:09:46,429
Oh, they'll love that.

186
00:09:46,505 --> 00:09:49,568
Maybe not at first,
but she'll win them over

187
00:09:49,611 --> 00:09:52,583
using her vast
financial knowledge

188
00:09:52,617 --> 00:09:55,316
and her keen instinct
for profit.

189
00:09:55,356 --> 00:09:59,660
She'll prove once and for all
that allowing

190
00:09:59,698 --> 00:10:02,795
females to wear clothing

191
00:10:02,837 --> 00:10:05,604
is the first step
toward a healthier

192
00:10:05,643 --> 00:10:08,206
and more prosperous
Ferengi economy.

193
00:10:08,249 --> 00:10:09,683
And three...

194
00:10:10,887 --> 00:10:13,153
What was three again, my dear?

195
00:10:13,192 --> 00:10:17,496
The FCA Commissioners
reinstate you as Nagus.

196
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:20,233
And who could ask
for a happier ending than that?

197
00:10:20,273 --> 00:10:23,143
But that's only the beginning,
lobekins.

198
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:24,808
I predict that one day

199
00:10:24,848 --> 00:10:27,843
a female will enter
the Tower of Commerce

200
00:10:27,887 --> 00:10:31,918
climb the 40 flights of stairs
to the Chamber of Opportunity

201
00:10:31,962 --> 00:10:34,525
and take her rightful place

202
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:39,340
as Grand Nagus
of the Ferengi Alliance.

203
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:42,772
Don't look at me.

204
00:10:42,817 --> 00:10:44,080
It was your amendment.

205
00:10:45,523 --> 00:10:48,427
Nagus, you remember
my son, Nog, don't you?

206
00:10:48,462 --> 00:10:50,830
He's the first Ferengi
to join Starfleet.

207
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:53,235
I'll try not to hold that
against him.

208
00:10:53,272 --> 00:10:57,303
And this is my wife, Leeta.

209
00:10:57,347 --> 00:11:00,217
I've heard...
so much about you.

210
00:11:00,253 --> 00:11:02,314
Would you like to hear more?

211
00:11:02,357 --> 00:11:05,022
Remember, she's Rom's wife.

212
00:11:05,062 --> 00:11:06,827
Meaning what?

213
00:11:06,865 --> 00:11:08,801
Meaning she's broke.

214
00:11:11,074 --> 00:11:14,205
She doesn't look broke
to me.

215
00:11:14,247 --> 00:11:15,306
Zekkie...

216
00:11:15,349 --> 00:11:16,875
Just having

217
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:18,946
a little harmless fun,
my sweet.

218
00:11:20,158 --> 00:11:21,821
Now, Quark,
you and your brother

219
00:11:21,862 --> 00:11:23,559
get rid of some
of this furniture

220
00:11:23,632 --> 00:11:25,066
and, you, get three

221
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:28,006
subspace transceivers off my
ship and set them up in here.

222
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,911
And where's my beetle snuff?

223
00:11:32,884 --> 00:11:36,449
Grand Nagus Brunt.

224
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,699
Good afternoon, I'm calling
on behalf of Grand Nagus Zek.

225
00:11:43,739 --> 00:11:45,834
The Nagus summons you
to a meeting here

226
00:11:45,877 --> 00:11:47,243
on Deep Space 9.

227
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,477
He's counting on your support.

228
00:11:49,518 --> 00:11:52,752
You'll be presented with some
very interesting financial data.

229
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,259
There's profit to be earned.

230
00:11:54,294 --> 00:11:55,888
And the Nagus wants you
to share

231
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,627
in these lucrative
opportunities.

232
00:11:57,667 --> 00:12:00,639
Yes, I'm talking
about the Grand Nagus.

233
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,233
No, not Brunt.

234
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,010
Grand Nagus Zek.

235
00:12:05,048 --> 00:12:06,711
Who said he was dead?

236
00:12:06,752 --> 00:12:09,154
Wait.
Don't end the transmission.

237
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,249
Hello? Hello?

238
00:12:10,293 --> 00:12:11,556
Where'd he go?

239
00:12:11,595 --> 00:12:15,056
I know all about the 94th Rule
of Acquisition.

240
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:17,435
I know... females and finances
don't mix.

241
00:12:17,473 --> 00:12:20,502
But that can be interpreted
in many different ways.

242
00:12:20,546 --> 00:12:22,345
Hello? Hello?

243
00:12:22,383 --> 00:12:24,785
That's not a very nice thing
to say about the Nagus.

244
00:12:24,821 --> 00:12:25,914
I beg your pardon?

245
00:12:25,957 --> 00:12:27,927
There's no need to be insulting.

246
00:12:27,961 --> 00:12:28,621
Hello?

247
00:12:28,662 --> 00:12:29,789
Hello? Hello?

248
00:12:29,831 --> 00:12:33,235
That female
happens to be my mother!

249
00:12:33,272 --> 00:12:34,297
Hello?

250
00:12:35,443 --> 00:12:37,174
Are you sure you contacted

251
00:12:37,212 --> 00:12:39,409
every Commissioner on this list?

252
00:12:39,451 --> 00:12:41,148
All 432 of them.

253
00:12:41,187 --> 00:12:44,786
And you could only convince
one of them to attend a meeting?

254
00:12:44,828 --> 00:12:47,664
Maybe if we made some
follow-up calls.

255
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,606
I helped every one
of those people earn a fortune!

256
00:12:51,642 --> 00:12:54,307
And this is how they repay me?

257
00:12:54,347 --> 00:12:55,679
What a bunch of ingrates.

258
00:12:55,783 --> 00:12:57,980
Well, the news isn't all bad.

259
00:12:58,021 --> 00:13:00,218
The Commissioner
who's agreed to come...

260
00:13:00,258 --> 00:13:01,453
it's Nilva.

261
00:13:01,495 --> 00:13:03,294
The Chairman of Slug-o-Cola.

262
00:13:03,332 --> 00:13:06,429
He's a very powerful
and influential voice

263
00:13:06,471 --> 00:13:07,962
within the FCA.

264
00:13:08,007 --> 00:13:11,036
Unfortunately, he's
an influential voice

265
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,548
for the status quo.

266
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,881
I don't think Slug-o-Cola

267
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,980
has changed its advertising
slogan in 300 years.

268
00:13:16,023 --> 00:13:17,355
Drink Slug-o-Cola

269
00:13:17,393 --> 00:13:19,921
...the slimiest cola
in the galaxy.

270
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,960
Why would Nilva agree
to come to the meeting?

271
00:13:23,004 --> 00:13:26,238
I'm not sure, but if I can
convince him to support Zek

272
00:13:26,277 --> 00:13:28,509
other Commissioners will follow.

273
00:13:28,549 --> 00:13:30,416
Well, it's a start, at least.

274
00:13:30,453 --> 00:13:33,687
See? I told you
it was too early to panic.

275
00:13:33,792 --> 00:13:36,559
Care to place a wager
on that?

276
00:13:36,598 --> 00:13:39,034
Grand Nagus Brunt!

277
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:42,007
Acting Grand Nagus Brunt.

278
00:13:42,042 --> 00:13:44,069
Now you can panic.

279
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:52,722
I'll take an Eelwasser.

280
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,196
No ice.

281
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:59,334
What are you doing here, Brunt?

282
00:14:00,713 --> 00:14:04,585
That's Grand Nagus Brunt.

283
00:14:04,621 --> 00:14:06,682
Acting Grand Nagus.

284
00:14:06,792 --> 00:14:09,628
Would someone
please tell that female

285
00:14:09,664 --> 00:14:11,634
to take off those clothes?

286
00:14:11,668 --> 00:14:13,194
It's disgusting.

287
00:14:13,237 --> 00:14:15,902
Get used to it, limp lobes.

288
00:14:15,943 --> 00:14:18,209
This is the future.

289
00:14:18,247 --> 00:14:21,185
Over my dead body.

290
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,713
If that's what it takes.

291
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:26,457
I don't suppose you're
here to reminisce

292
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,627
about the time you helped
my brother and me

293
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:30,298
rescue Moogie from the Dominion.

294
00:14:30,338 --> 00:14:32,901
You're right,
that's not why I'm here.

295
00:14:32,944 --> 00:14:34,538
Though I find it ironic

296
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:36,881
that helping
to rescue your mother

297
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:40,220
was the first step
on my road to becoming Nagus.

298
00:14:40,258 --> 00:14:41,556
Don't remind me.

299
00:14:41,595 --> 00:14:44,590
I never should have
given you your job back

300
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:45,761
with the FCA.

301
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:47,101
But you did.

302
00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:49,541
And as a liquidator,
I was able to bribe my way

303
00:14:49,577 --> 00:14:51,171
back into a position of power.

304
00:14:51,213 --> 00:14:53,445
That is ironic.

305
00:14:53,485 --> 00:14:55,717
Face it, Zek.

306
00:14:55,756 --> 00:14:57,350
It's over.

307
00:14:57,392 --> 00:14:58,724
You're finished...

308
00:14:58,762 --> 00:15:00,789
bankrupt.

309
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:05,273
I'm going to liquidate you.

310
00:15:06,611 --> 00:15:09,013
Cancel that Eelwasser.

311
00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:10,678
And get me a...

312
00:15:12,189 --> 00:15:14,557
Slug-o-Cola instead.

313
00:15:16,464 --> 00:15:18,127
On second thought...

314
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:22,130
I'll just wait till
Chairman Nilva gets here.

315
00:15:22,175 --> 00:15:24,942
I'm sure he'll be happy
to provide his new Nagus

316
00:15:24,981 --> 00:15:26,347
with all the Slug-o-Cola

317
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,510
I can drink.

318
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:29,420
How did you know
Nilva was coming here?

319
00:15:29,457 --> 00:15:31,893
Because it's my business
to know.

320
00:15:31,928 --> 00:15:33,454
Go on.

321
00:15:33,498 --> 00:15:35,161
Have your little meeting.

322
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:38,173
Whatever you offer
Nilva, I'll double it.

323
00:15:38,207 --> 00:15:39,232
That's it!

324
00:15:39,276 --> 00:15:40,939
Get out of my bar.

325
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,384
You dare threaten your Nagus?

326
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:45,819
Acting Nagus.

327
00:15:45,923 --> 00:15:47,756
You may liquidate us tomorrow

328
00:15:47,793 --> 00:15:50,356
but right now,
this is still my establishment.

329
00:15:50,398 --> 00:15:52,926
Now, get out
before I kick you out.

330
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:56,374
I'm going to make you a pauper.

331
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:59,849
Uri'lash... we're leaving.

332
00:15:59,884 --> 00:16:03,790
Say good-bye
to these poor people.

333
00:16:03,859 --> 00:16:05,658
Out.

334
00:16:12,843 --> 00:16:15,336
My boy, I'm proud of you.

335
00:16:15,381 --> 00:16:16,508
So am I.

336
00:16:16,551 --> 00:16:17,951
Me, too.

337
00:16:17,987 --> 00:16:21,016
I just kicked the Grand
Nagus out of my bar.

338
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,189
Acting Grand Nagus.

339
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,564
Whatever.

340
00:16:25,602 --> 00:16:27,265
I need to lie down.

341
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:35,522
You busy, Quark?

342
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:36,655
Busy?

343
00:16:36,698 --> 00:16:38,030
Me?

344
00:16:38,067 --> 00:16:41,506
Nah. I'm just lying here
wondering if it's not too late

345
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,841
for me to start
a new life somewhere.

346
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:48,080
Oh, Quark, there's nothing wrong
with your life.

347
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,714
I'm sorry.
I stand corrected.

348
00:16:49,757 --> 00:16:50,884
You're overreacting.

349
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,224
Whatever you say.

350
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,390
Reminds me of when
you were a lobling.

351
00:16:54,432 --> 00:16:57,268
You were always
such a miserable child.

352
00:16:58,307 --> 00:16:59,570
Moogie, leave me alone.

353
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,408
I'm your mother;
I can't leave you alone.

354
00:17:01,446 --> 00:17:02,505
Try!

355
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:03,812
Come on, on your feet.

356
00:17:03,852 --> 00:17:05,343
Zekkie's waiting for you
in the bar.

357
00:17:05,388 --> 00:17:06,879
Now what?

358
00:17:06,924 --> 00:17:08,917
He feels like playing
a game of <i>tongo.</i>

359
00:17:08,962 --> 00:17:11,627
We're all facing banishment
from Ferengi society

360
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:13,033
and he wants to play <i>tongo?</i>

361
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,801
He wants to play <i>tongo.</i>

362
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,400
I want to have
a late-night snack.

363
00:17:16,443 --> 00:17:19,210
You want to lie here,
feeling sorry for yourself.

364
00:17:19,249 --> 00:17:21,777
We all deal with stress
in different ways.

365
00:17:21,821 --> 00:17:23,950
Any fresh tube grubs around?

366
00:17:23,992 --> 00:17:26,258
How can you eat
at a time like this?

367
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:27,559
It's simple.

368
00:17:27,633 --> 00:17:30,799
You put one end of the tube grub
between your front teeth

369
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:32,365
and you suck them right up.

370
00:17:32,408 --> 00:17:34,105
You want tube grubs?
Fine.

371
00:17:35,882 --> 00:17:37,077
Enjoy.

372
00:17:37,118 --> 00:17:38,245
These are minced.

373
00:17:38,287 --> 00:17:39,687
I wanted fresh.

374
00:17:39,723 --> 00:17:41,055
You know, this is
all your fault.

375
00:17:41,092 --> 00:17:42,253
It's my fault

376
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:44,197
you don't have fresh tube grubs?

377
00:17:44,232 --> 00:17:46,134
I'm not talking
about tube grubs.

378
00:17:46,169 --> 00:17:47,798
I'm talking
about Ferengi females

379
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,778
wearing clothes
and earning profit.

380
00:17:50,812 --> 00:17:53,443
I'm talking
about Grand Nagus Brunt.

381
00:17:53,484 --> 00:17:55,113
Acting Grand Nagus Brunt!

382
00:17:55,154 --> 00:17:56,953
You're not fooling me, Moogie.

383
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,223
You've been plotting
this all along.

384
00:17:59,262 --> 00:18:00,628
Ever since you met Zek

385
00:18:00,699 --> 00:18:02,225
you've been working on him

386
00:18:02,268 --> 00:18:05,468
manipulating him,
whispering things in his ears

387
00:18:05,508 --> 00:18:07,535
things like "Equality
for Females."

388
00:18:07,578 --> 00:18:08,568
What's wrong with that?

389
00:18:08,615 --> 00:18:10,209
I'll tell you
what's wrong with that.

390
00:18:10,251 --> 00:18:12,848
You've ruined Zek's life,
your life, Rom's life.

391
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,587
As if you cared about any of us.

392
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,322
It's your life
you're worried about.

393
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:17,831
You bet I'm worried.

394
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:20,565
Nobody else seems to care
what happens to me.

395
00:18:20,605 --> 00:18:22,871
You come here to my station

396
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,743
take over my quarters,
make me

397
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,306
a part of your
subversive schemes...

398
00:18:26,349 --> 00:18:27,783
What's the matter, Quark?

399
00:18:27,819 --> 00:18:29,948
Are you afraid
you picked the wrong side?

400
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,390
You can always
go crawling to Brunt,

401
00:18:31,426 --> 00:18:32,394
beg his forgiveness.

402
00:18:32,428 --> 00:18:34,398
I don't want anything
to do with Brunt.

403
00:18:34,432 --> 00:18:36,527
I want my old Nagus back!

404
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:37,731
Do you.

405
00:18:37,773 --> 00:18:39,970
I want Zek to be
the way he used to be

406
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:43,643
before he met you,
before you twisted his thinking

407
00:18:43,685 --> 00:18:45,882
with your-your...
your feminine wiles.

408
00:18:45,922 --> 00:18:50,158
Before he met me, Zek was
a lonely, unhappy man.

409
00:18:50,197 --> 00:18:51,894
But he was rich!

410
00:18:51,934 --> 00:18:54,497
He was the most powerful
Ferengi alive.

411
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:56,441
Now what is he?
A puppet.

412
00:18:56,476 --> 00:18:57,910
And you're the one
pulling the strings

413
00:18:57,946 --> 00:19:00,611
making him dance
to your evil feminist tune.

414
00:19:00,652 --> 00:19:02,713
You're the worst thing
that ever happened to Zek!

415
00:19:02,756 --> 00:19:04,350
You're the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

416
00:19:04,392 --> 00:19:06,555
In fact, you're the worst thing
that ever happened

417
00:19:06,596 --> 00:19:08,361
to the entire Ferengi Alliance!

418
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,097
Maybe I am!

419
00:19:10,137 --> 00:19:13,200
But at least I'm not like you.

420
00:19:13,243 --> 00:19:17,274
A selfish, spineless,
ungrateful...

421
00:19:17,318 --> 00:19:18,479
Don't forget miserable.

422
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,219
Miserable excuse for a son!

423
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:23,229
Is that the best you can do?

424
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,663
I haven't even begun.

425
00:19:24,733 --> 00:19:26,862
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

426
00:19:26,904 --> 00:19:28,567
Why, you are nothing but a...

427
00:19:28,607 --> 00:19:30,075
why, you are... you...

428
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,670
Go ahead. Say it.

429
00:19:31,747 --> 00:19:33,147
You're a...

430
00:19:33,183 --> 00:19:34,674
I'm still waiting.

431
00:19:34,787 --> 00:19:36,814
You're a... you're a...

432
00:19:36,857 --> 00:19:39,350
A... what?!

433
00:19:41,734 --> 00:19:43,704
Moogie...

434
00:19:43,805 --> 00:19:46,241
Moogie? Moogie!

435
00:19:47,746 --> 00:19:48,771
Moogie?

436
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:52,581
Moogie? Moogie?

437
00:19:53,925 --> 00:19:55,588
Moogie...

438
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:56,993
please don't die.

439
00:19:57,031 --> 00:19:59,024
She's not going to die.

440
00:19:59,068 --> 00:20:00,559
She's going to get better.

441
00:20:00,604 --> 00:20:03,542
I hope so... for my sake...

442
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,103
for her sake...

443
00:20:05,147 --> 00:20:07,242
for the sake of the entire

444
00:20:07,284 --> 00:20:09,754
Ferengi Alliance,
and most of all

445
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:12,283
I hope she gets better
for your sake, Quark

446
00:20:12,328 --> 00:20:13,762
because if she doesn't...

447
00:20:13,865 --> 00:20:15,333
What did I do?

448
00:20:15,367 --> 00:20:18,339
That's exactly the question
I keep asking myself!

449
00:20:18,373 --> 00:20:19,773
What did you do to her?!

450
00:20:19,877 --> 00:20:20,970
I told you.

451
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:22,344
She said she was hungry.

452
00:20:22,381 --> 00:20:23,907
I gave her some tube grubs.

453
00:20:23,951 --> 00:20:26,217
She thanked me...
and then she collapsed.

454
00:20:26,256 --> 00:20:28,351
I wish you'd stop
making me relive it.

455
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,226
Are you sure you didn't
do or say anything

456
00:20:30,264 --> 00:20:31,425
that might have upset her?

457
00:20:31,466 --> 00:20:32,764
I don't want to
talk about it anymore.

458
00:20:32,803 --> 00:20:35,171
What's wrong, Quark?
Your conscience bothering you?

459
00:20:35,207 --> 00:20:36,801
I haven't done anything wrong.

460
00:20:36,844 --> 00:20:38,312
That's not
what your mother says.

461
00:20:38,346 --> 00:20:40,316
Doctor... how's Moogie?

462
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,340
Will she live?

463
00:20:41,386 --> 00:20:42,547
Oh, yes, she'll live.

464
00:20:42,588 --> 00:20:44,455
She needed a new heart,
and it's functioning normally

465
00:20:44,492 --> 00:20:46,826
but she's going to need
a few days complete rest.

466
00:20:46,931 --> 00:20:51,805
And she'll need to be kept
far away from him.

467
00:20:51,841 --> 00:20:53,606
And why is that, Doctor?

468
00:20:53,643 --> 00:20:55,704
I'm not sure exactly.

469
00:20:55,747 --> 00:20:57,546
All I do know
is that she keeps repeating

470
00:20:57,585 --> 00:20:59,145
the same phrase over and over:

471
00:20:59,188 --> 00:21:02,683
"It's all Quark's fault.
It's all Quark's fault."

472
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:05,325
I wonder what she means by that.

473
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:17,983
And, uh... then I...

474
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,392
I accused her of being

475
00:21:19,428 --> 00:21:22,059
the worst thing that ever
happened to the Ferengi Alliance

476
00:21:22,101 --> 00:21:27,169
and she clutched her chest
and collapsed.

477
00:21:27,211 --> 00:21:29,681
Moogie and I argue all the time.

478
00:21:29,715 --> 00:21:31,275
It's our way
of showing affection.

479
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:34,723
Well, if you ask me, Quark,
the worst thing

480
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:38,597
that ever happened
to the Ferengi Alliance is you.

481
00:21:38,633 --> 00:21:41,196
I'm sorry.

482
00:21:41,239 --> 00:21:42,673
Well, I suppose we
should contact Nilva

483
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,405
and tell him the meeting
has to be postponed.

484
00:21:44,445 --> 00:21:46,438
We can't postpone the meeting!

485
00:21:46,482 --> 00:21:50,513
In two days, the FCA
is going to confirm Brunt

486
00:21:50,557 --> 00:21:52,720
as the new Grand Nagus.

487
00:21:52,761 --> 00:21:55,494
Boy, when things go wrong...

488
00:21:55,534 --> 00:21:58,199
The only thing to do

489
00:21:58,239 --> 00:22:02,441
is to get down on your knees
and beg for mercy.

490
00:22:03,918 --> 00:22:05,854
Who knows?

491
00:22:05,922 --> 00:22:09,326
You might find me
in a charitable mood.

492
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:11,855
By the time
I get through with you

493
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,599
you're the one
who's going to need charity.

494
00:22:14,638 --> 00:22:17,269
Such brave words...

495
00:22:17,311 --> 00:22:19,474
yet so empty.

496
00:22:19,515 --> 00:22:21,747
I was very relieved

497
00:22:21,786 --> 00:22:25,020
to hear your mother
is going to be all right.

498
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,725
Of course,
it doesn't do you much good.

499
00:22:27,765 --> 00:22:30,828
Nilva will be arriving tonight

500
00:22:30,872 --> 00:22:34,744
expecting to meet
a brilliant Ferengi female.

501
00:22:34,779 --> 00:22:37,011
Do you know any?

502
00:22:37,051 --> 00:22:39,180
I mean, besides Ishka?

503
00:22:39,221 --> 00:22:40,815
I certainly don't.

504
00:22:44,231 --> 00:22:46,098
How...

505
00:22:46,135 --> 00:22:48,698
pitiful.

506
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,937
One day you're the Grand Nagus

507
00:22:51,012 --> 00:22:53,745
of the Ferengi Alliance,
and the next

508
00:22:53,783 --> 00:22:58,316
you're nothing but a
common barroom brawler.

509
00:22:58,359 --> 00:22:59,850
You see what happens

510
00:22:59,896 --> 00:23:03,096
when you put your
faith in a female?

511
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:16,356
What about Leeta?

512
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,363
What about her?

513
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:18,923
Maybe she could
meet with Nilva.

514
00:23:18,968 --> 00:23:21,097
She handles my finances,
and she's a female.

515
00:23:21,139 --> 00:23:22,733
And a very beautiful one
at that.

516
00:23:22,774 --> 00:23:25,769
But Nilva's expecting
to meet with a Ferengi female.

517
00:23:25,814 --> 00:23:27,180
We'll never get one here
in time.

518
00:23:27,217 --> 00:23:28,185
We're doomed.

519
00:23:28,219 --> 00:23:29,380
No, we're not.

520
00:23:29,421 --> 00:23:32,291
You think if Ishka were here,
she'd give up?

521
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,752
If she were here, we
wouldn't have a problem.

522
00:23:33,885 --> 00:23:35,114
That's not my point.

523
00:23:35,155 --> 00:23:37,387
Your mother
would never accept defeat.

524
00:23:37,426 --> 00:23:40,694
If she couldn't find
another female, she'd...

525
00:23:40,732 --> 00:23:42,395
she'd... she'd...

526
00:23:42,503 --> 00:23:43,835
She'd what?

527
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:46,069
She'd make one.

528
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,135
You mean a hologram?

529
00:23:47,179 --> 00:23:50,083
Better than a hologram.

530
00:23:50,118 --> 00:23:52,681
What could be better
than a hologram?

531
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:54,386
You.

532
00:24:06,017 --> 00:24:08,750
Dr. Bashir certainly did
a wonderful job on you.

533
00:24:08,788 --> 00:24:11,487
I'd call the operation
a complete success.

534
00:24:11,527 --> 00:24:14,522
It must've been a
very delicate procedure.

535
00:24:14,567 --> 00:24:16,662
Tell me about it.

536
00:24:16,704 --> 00:24:17,831
There.

537
00:24:28,628 --> 00:24:31,759
Well, how do I look?

538
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:34,872
You look nice.

539
00:24:34,907 --> 00:24:36,205
Nice?

540
00:24:36,244 --> 00:24:37,975
That's all?

541
00:24:38,014 --> 00:24:39,073
Very nice.

542
00:24:39,116 --> 00:24:41,713
You may look like a female

543
00:24:41,754 --> 00:24:44,385
but you have to do something
about that voice.

544
00:24:44,427 --> 00:24:45,725
I'm trying!

545
00:24:45,762 --> 00:24:48,427
I-I mean... I'm trying.

546
00:24:48,468 --> 00:24:50,461
Well, try harder.

547
00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:51,700
And stop looking down.

548
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:54,338
I need to see
what I look like.

549
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,780
Someone get me a mirror.

550
00:25:03,832 --> 00:25:06,325
You see, Brother?
You look lovely.

551
00:25:07,373 --> 00:25:08,636
There go his hormones.

552
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:09,973
You mean her hormones?

553
00:25:10,012 --> 00:25:11,241
Ta-take it away!

554
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,305
Take it away!

555
00:25:12,349 --> 00:25:13,681
Oh, I'm sorry.

556
00:25:13,718 --> 00:25:16,815
I just feel so-so different.

557
00:25:16,858 --> 00:25:19,796
Would you stop staring
at your chest?

558
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:22,232
I'm not staring at my chest.

559
00:25:22,269 --> 00:25:24,239
I'm staring at my hips.

560
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:26,004
Aren't they too big?

561
00:25:26,044 --> 00:25:27,205
Your hips are fine.

562
00:25:27,246 --> 00:25:29,239
Now, let's get
down to business.

563
00:25:29,283 --> 00:25:33,053
These are your mother's notes
for her meeting with Nilva.

564
00:25:33,091 --> 00:25:35,527
Study them carefully.

565
00:25:36,664 --> 00:25:39,066
"Female apparel for
a new source of latinum

566
00:25:39,103 --> 00:25:40,435
"for a new Ferenginar.

567
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:42,499
"Hypicate cream

568
00:25:42,609 --> 00:25:45,045
for smooth skin
and healthier profits."

569
00:25:45,082 --> 00:25:48,248
All these facts and figures...

570
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,758
they're too much
for me to remember.

571
00:25:50,792 --> 00:25:52,455
Oh, nonsense.

572
00:25:52,496 --> 00:25:56,231
You just need a little time
to practice your presentation.

573
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,363
And while you're at it

574
00:25:57,406 --> 00:25:59,376
we need to practice
your walk.

575
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:00,400
What's wrong with my walk?

576
00:26:00,445 --> 00:26:02,915
You're... lumbering.

577
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,476
This is never going to work.

578
00:26:04,587 --> 00:26:06,955
Don't cry, Brother.

579
00:26:06,991 --> 00:26:08,254
Here. Let me show you.

580
00:26:08,294 --> 00:26:09,957
Watch carefully.

581
00:26:15,275 --> 00:26:17,177
You see, it's more of a glide.

582
00:26:17,212 --> 00:26:20,309
That's... good.

583
00:26:20,352 --> 00:26:23,017
And when you sit, make sure
your knees are touching

584
00:26:23,056 --> 00:26:25,755
and don't forget
to relax your shoulders

585
00:26:25,795 --> 00:26:27,765
but keep your bottom tight.

586
00:26:31,207 --> 00:26:32,175
What?

587
00:26:32,209 --> 00:26:33,177
He's the one

588
00:26:33,211 --> 00:26:34,679
that should be
wearing the dress.

589
00:26:34,713 --> 00:26:36,204
Why me?

590
00:26:37,986 --> 00:26:40,183
You're so adorable...

591
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:43,288
and... complicated.

592
00:26:43,331 --> 00:26:45,358
Maybe it's not too late.

593
00:26:45,402 --> 00:26:47,668
Come on, Brother,
I'll take you to Dr. Bashir.

594
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:49,733
Forget it, Quark.

595
00:26:49,777 --> 00:26:51,940
Rom may make
a better female than you

596
00:26:51,981 --> 00:26:56,081
but when it comes to business,
you're the better Ferengi.

597
00:26:56,123 --> 00:26:58,890
Looks like your stupidity
has saved you again.

598
00:26:58,928 --> 00:27:00,864
It comes in handy sometimes.

599
00:27:03,271 --> 00:27:04,398
I can do this.

600
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,842
It's only one meeting.

601
00:27:06,877 --> 00:27:09,906
I can be a female
for one meeting...

602
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:10,918
can't I?

603
00:27:10,952 --> 00:27:12,785
Not if you're lumbering.

604
00:27:12,823 --> 00:27:14,884
I'll conduct the
meeting sitting down.

605
00:27:14,927 --> 00:27:15,986
Tighten your bottom.

606
00:27:16,029 --> 00:27:19,969
Well, I think you're
doing wonderfully, my dear.

607
00:27:20,004 --> 00:27:21,803
I'm proud of you.

608
00:27:21,841 --> 00:27:23,207
I'm sorry.

609
00:27:24,313 --> 00:27:27,046
You know,
you may walk like a man

610
00:27:27,084 --> 00:27:31,252
but you make
a very attractive female.

611
00:27:31,294 --> 00:27:33,491
Confusing, isn't it?

612
00:27:33,531 --> 00:27:34,965
Not to me.

613
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,697
He's here.
He's on the station.

614
00:27:36,737 --> 00:27:37,705
Who is?

615
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:38,968
Nilva.

616
00:27:39,008 --> 00:27:41,478
But he's not supposed
to arrive until tomorrow.

617
00:27:41,514 --> 00:27:43,143
That Nilva, he's a tricky one

618
00:27:43,184 --> 00:27:44,744
but he makes a good cola.

619
00:27:44,787 --> 00:27:45,982
What do we do?

620
00:27:46,022 --> 00:27:47,855
No, I-I can't meet Nilva now.

621
00:27:47,893 --> 00:27:49,191
I'm still lumbering.

622
00:27:49,229 --> 00:27:50,629
You look very nice.

623
00:27:50,732 --> 00:27:51,631
Nog, I want you

624
00:27:51,734 --> 00:27:53,134
to escort the chairman
to his quarters.

625
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:55,367
Tell him I'll meet him
for dinner tonight.

626
00:27:55,408 --> 00:27:57,469
Yeah.
Oh, what if he asks about Ishka?

627
00:27:57,512 --> 00:28:00,005
Tell him that Ishka is sick

628
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,986
but that, tomorrow,
he'll be meeting

629
00:28:02,021 --> 00:28:05,187
with my other female
financial advisor...

630
00:28:05,228 --> 00:28:08,689
uh... uh...

631
00:28:08,735 --> 00:28:10,067
Lumba.

632
00:28:10,104 --> 00:28:11,971
Right.

633
00:28:12,007 --> 00:28:13,339
Lumba?

634
00:28:13,378 --> 00:28:16,977
You'd better start memorizing
those notes.

635
00:28:17,017 --> 00:28:19,453
First, we need
to practice your walking.

636
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:20,617
And your sitting.

637
00:28:20,692 --> 00:28:22,321
And you'd better work
on that voice.

638
00:28:22,362 --> 00:28:23,728
Any other comments?

639
00:28:23,765 --> 00:28:28,730
Has anyone ever told you
that you have lovely eyes?

640
00:28:35,488 --> 00:28:36,786
Here.

641
00:28:36,824 --> 00:28:38,087
Have a Slug-o-Cola.

642
00:28:38,126 --> 00:28:39,355
Thank you.

643
00:28:39,396 --> 00:28:41,993
Welcome to Deep Space 9,
Chairman Nilva.

644
00:28:42,034 --> 00:28:43,765
You drink Slug-o-Cola,
don't you?

645
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,002
The slimiest cola in the galaxy?

646
00:28:46,042 --> 00:28:47,271
Doesn't everybody?

647
00:28:48,314 --> 00:28:49,407
Good boy.

648
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:50,782
Now, take me to Zek.

649
00:28:50,819 --> 00:28:52,516
Zek wanted me to take you to...

650
00:28:52,556 --> 00:28:53,615
Oh, don't argue with me.

651
00:28:53,658 --> 00:28:55,651
Drink your cola
and lead the way.

652
00:28:55,695 --> 00:28:57,426
Um... uh...

653
00:29:04,111 --> 00:29:05,637
Uh...

654
00:29:05,748 --> 00:29:07,809
You sure you don't want
to stop by your quarters

655
00:29:07,853 --> 00:29:08,912
and freshen up?

656
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:11,654
Not before I meet
this female advisor of Zek's.

657
00:29:17,606 --> 00:29:20,806
Nilva, how nice
to see you again.

658
00:29:20,845 --> 00:29:22,439
Grand Nagus Brunt.

659
00:29:22,482 --> 00:29:24,349
Acting Grand Nagus Brunt.

660
00:29:24,386 --> 00:29:26,151
Well, I had a feeling
I might find you here.

661
00:29:27,191 --> 00:29:29,822
I thought
after your meeting with Zek

662
00:29:29,863 --> 00:29:31,890
we could have a little chat.

663
00:29:31,934 --> 00:29:33,300
Oh, of course.

664
00:29:33,337 --> 00:29:36,639
But I've really come
to meet this Ishka female.

665
00:29:36,677 --> 00:29:38,111
Haven't you heard?

666
00:29:38,146 --> 00:29:39,637
Ishka's in the Infirmary.

667
00:29:39,683 --> 00:29:41,915
She's in no position
to meet anyone.

668
00:29:41,954 --> 00:29:43,047
Which is why you'll be meeting

669
00:29:43,089 --> 00:29:46,027
with another one of Zek's
financial advisors.

670
00:29:46,062 --> 00:29:47,725
Her name is Lumba.

671
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:49,735
Never heard of her.

672
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:53,209
Oh, Zek has two female advisors?

673
00:29:53,243 --> 00:29:55,372
I didn't know there were
two Ferengi females

674
00:29:55,415 --> 00:29:57,248
on the station.

675
00:29:57,284 --> 00:29:58,752
Well, what are we waiting for?

676
00:29:58,788 --> 00:30:01,190
Let's go meet this other female.

677
00:30:01,225 --> 00:30:02,352
Are you sure you
wouldn't like me

678
00:30:02,395 --> 00:30:03,955
to show you around
the station first?

679
00:30:03,998 --> 00:30:07,493
I want to meet Lumba.

680
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,112
Lumba?

681
00:30:14,151 --> 00:30:15,882
Let's try it again.

682
00:30:27,011 --> 00:30:28,479
My name is Lumba.

683
00:30:28,514 --> 00:30:30,780
You must be Chairman Nilva.

684
00:30:30,818 --> 00:30:33,813
Zek has told me
so much about you...

685
00:30:33,858 --> 00:30:34,826
Ow!

686
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,158
What's wrong now?

687
00:30:36,195 --> 00:30:38,962
It's these earrings,
they're killing me.

688
00:30:39,001 --> 00:30:40,527
Do I have to wear them?

689
00:30:40,571 --> 00:30:43,168
No woman is complete
without earrings.

690
00:30:43,209 --> 00:30:45,577
Why does everyone
keep looking at me?

691
00:30:45,615 --> 00:30:47,049
I'm going to bed.

692
00:30:47,084 --> 00:30:48,211
Now?

693
00:30:48,253 --> 00:30:49,380
I'm exhausted.

694
00:30:49,423 --> 00:30:50,550
If I don't get any sleep

695
00:30:50,591 --> 00:30:51,847
I'll never make it through
tomorrow's meeting.

696
00:30:52,949 --> 00:30:54,383
Who could that be?

697
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:55,409
Come in.

698
00:30:57,324 --> 00:30:58,918
Nilva!

699
00:30:58,961 --> 00:31:00,088
Zek!

700
00:31:03,871 --> 00:31:06,205
Here. Have a Slug-o-Cola.

701
00:31:06,242 --> 00:31:07,471
Oh, don't worry.

702
00:31:07,512 --> 00:31:09,709
I brought enough for everyone.

703
00:31:09,749 --> 00:31:11,844
He insisted on seeing
you immediately.

704
00:31:11,887 --> 00:31:15,087
Why, you must be Lunga.

705
00:31:15,126 --> 00:31:17,187
Lumba.

706
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:21,500
Oh, a clothed female Ferengi...

707
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,134
and with your approval, no less.

708
00:31:23,176 --> 00:31:28,551
Oh, either you've been
inhaling too much beetle snuff

709
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:33,188
or you're the greatest
visionary ever to sit atop

710
00:31:33,229 --> 00:31:34,720
the Tower of Commerce.

711
00:31:34,766 --> 00:31:36,668
Well, uh,
why don't you and I have

712
00:31:36,703 --> 00:31:38,536
dinner tonight
and try to figure it out?

713
00:31:38,574 --> 00:31:40,669
We can go to Quark's

714
00:31:40,711 --> 00:31:45,152
and get some nice
juicy snail steaks.

715
00:31:45,186 --> 00:31:47,315
You can meet
with Lumba tomorrow.

716
00:31:47,357 --> 00:31:49,589
I'm afraid that's not possible.

717
00:31:49,629 --> 00:31:51,690
You see, I have to leave
first thing in the morning.

718
00:31:51,733 --> 00:31:54,169
I'm due back on Ferenginar
for an important

719
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:55,672
stockholder's meeting.

720
00:31:55,708 --> 00:32:00,081
Oh, but those snail steaks
do sound tempting.

721
00:32:00,116 --> 00:32:01,949
I know.

722
00:32:03,122 --> 00:32:06,322
Why don't I have
dinner with Lumba?

723
00:32:06,362 --> 00:32:07,796
Oh, with me?

724
00:32:07,832 --> 00:32:10,429
Won't you feel uncomfortable
being seen

725
00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:12,907
in public with a clothed female?

726
00:32:12,942 --> 00:32:14,775
Well, of course, I will

727
00:32:14,813 --> 00:32:16,442
but you and I have earned

728
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:19,545
a lot of latinum
together over the years.

729
00:32:19,589 --> 00:32:22,755
That should be worth
some small discomfort.

730
00:32:22,795 --> 00:32:27,328
But Lumba better be
all you claim she is

731
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:31,572
or I'll have
to liquidate you myself.

732
00:32:35,488 --> 00:32:38,016
Here. Let's eat.

733
00:32:47,612 --> 00:32:49,445
Have fun.

734
00:33:03,209 --> 00:33:05,840
Two snail steaks,
lightly seared.

735
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:09,082
Now, tell me something.

736
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:10,419
Doesn't wearing
all those clothes

737
00:33:10,456 --> 00:33:11,924
make you feel like a deviant?

738
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,292
Not really.

739
00:33:13,329 --> 00:33:14,490
And I'll tell you why.

740
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:17,298
Because, under all these clothes

741
00:33:17,337 --> 00:33:19,934
I know I'm totally naked.

742
00:33:19,976 --> 00:33:22,071
I'll try to remember that.

743
00:33:23,382 --> 00:33:25,375
Now, you'd better explain to me

744
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,447
how allowing females
to wear clothing

745
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:31,430
is going to make me richer
than I already am.

746
00:33:31,465 --> 00:33:34,403
I was hoping you were
going to ask me that.

747
00:33:34,438 --> 00:33:36,408
You see this dress
I'm wearing?

748
00:33:36,442 --> 00:33:38,309
Have you any idea

749
00:33:38,346 --> 00:33:41,409
how much it would sell
for on Ferenginar?

750
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:44,185
Would someone please tell
me what they're saying?

751
00:33:44,224 --> 00:33:45,887
- Shh!
- Shh!

752
00:33:47,932 --> 00:33:50,563
Let me see if I understand.

753
00:33:50,604 --> 00:33:55,569
Giving females the right
to wear clothing

754
00:33:55,614 --> 00:33:59,281
allows them to... have pockets.

755
00:33:59,321 --> 00:34:00,687
Once they have pockets

756
00:34:00,724 --> 00:34:03,423
they're going to want
to fill them with latinum.

757
00:34:03,462 --> 00:34:05,830
Which means they're going
to need jobs.

758
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,931
And once
they start earning latinum

759
00:34:08,974 --> 00:34:11,001
they're going
to want to spend it.

760
00:34:11,045 --> 00:34:13,949
Which means,
Ferenginar will be expanding

761
00:34:13,984 --> 00:34:15,715
its workforce
and its consumer base

762
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:17,485
at the same time.

763
00:34:20,029 --> 00:34:22,967
Oh, there will be plenty
of profit for everyone.

764
00:34:23,002 --> 00:34:26,168
When it comes to profit,
I'm your girl.

765
00:34:26,208 --> 00:34:31,310
And... I'm sure you could use

766
00:34:31,352 --> 00:34:32,820
a little extra latinum.

767
00:34:32,855 --> 00:34:34,825
Meaning what?

768
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:37,592
I read the beverage trades.

769
00:34:37,698 --> 00:34:40,363
Sales of Slug-o-Cola
have flattened out

770
00:34:40,403 --> 00:34:43,273
and Eelwasser
had a very impressive

771
00:34:43,309 --> 00:34:44,436
third quarter.

772
00:34:44,478 --> 00:34:46,345
Aw, they were lucky.
That's all.

773
00:34:46,382 --> 00:34:48,545
I know a way
you can increase sales

774
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:51,752
of Slug-o-Cola
by 50 to 60 percent.

775
00:34:53,797 --> 00:34:55,858
I'm all ears.

776
00:34:55,901 --> 00:34:58,805
Target the new female consumer.

777
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,746
Make Slug-o-Cola her drink.

778
00:35:02,782 --> 00:35:04,581
There's nothing stopping her
from drinking it now.

779
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:07,213
But you're
not encouraging her either.

780
00:35:07,257 --> 00:35:09,591
"The slimiest cola
in the galaxy"?

781
00:35:09,629 --> 00:35:12,658
That kind of slogan
doesn't appeal to women.

782
00:35:14,137 --> 00:35:15,605
Well, what would?

783
00:35:15,641 --> 00:35:17,941
Let me see.

784
00:35:17,978 --> 00:35:23,114
Slug-o-Cola contains
43 percent live algae, right?

785
00:35:23,155 --> 00:35:25,786
In every bottle.

786
00:35:25,828 --> 00:35:28,493
Well, how about something like

787
00:35:28,532 --> 00:35:30,434
"Drink Slug-o-Cola...

788
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:32,531
and keep...

789
00:35:32,574 --> 00:35:35,102
your teeth
that lovely shade of green"?

790
00:35:35,146 --> 00:35:37,207
Oh...

791
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:41,623
Zek was right about you.

792
00:35:41,659 --> 00:35:44,529
You're very intelligent.

793
00:35:44,564 --> 00:35:47,229
For a female.

794
00:35:50,711 --> 00:35:54,344
I think it's time
for dessert now.

795
00:35:54,384 --> 00:35:55,818
Good idea.

796
00:35:57,624 --> 00:36:00,528
I thought we were going
to have dessert.

797
00:36:00,563 --> 00:36:02,054
Oh, we are...

798
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,865
in my quarters.

799
00:36:28,485 --> 00:36:30,512
Oh, I never ever thought

800
00:36:30,556 --> 00:36:34,963
I'd find a clothed
female so... enticing.

801
00:36:36,201 --> 00:36:37,669
Enticing?

802
00:36:37,705 --> 00:36:38,866
Me?

803
00:36:38,907 --> 00:36:40,375
Don't be silly.

804
00:36:42,748 --> 00:36:45,777
It's so good
to finally be alone...

805
00:36:46,823 --> 00:36:50,023
without all those
people staring at us.

806
00:36:50,062 --> 00:36:52,829
Although, I must admit

807
00:36:52,868 --> 00:36:57,241
I-I did find it
somewhat stimulating.

808
00:36:58,278 --> 00:37:00,009
Maybe a little too stimulating.

809
00:37:00,049 --> 00:37:01,951
Oh, can I help it

810
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:05,447
if my lobes burn
for you, huh, huh?

811
00:37:05,493 --> 00:37:08,795
If you don't believe me,
just touch them.

812
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:09,823
Touch them.

813
00:37:11,571 --> 00:37:13,302
I'll take your word for it.

814
00:37:15,747 --> 00:37:17,910
You said you'd do
anything for me.

815
00:37:17,951 --> 00:37:19,921
I lied.

816
00:37:19,955 --> 00:37:22,518
Oh, oh, oh...

817
00:37:25,266 --> 00:37:28,033
Oh, come to me,
my little love slave.

818
00:37:28,072 --> 00:37:29,563
Ah!

819
00:37:37,791 --> 00:37:40,284
Yeah, yeah!

820
00:37:41,799 --> 00:37:44,292
Stay away!
Stay away, stay away.

821
00:37:45,339 --> 00:37:46,364
Ha!

822
00:37:46,408 --> 00:37:47,501
Marry me.

823
00:37:47,543 --> 00:37:49,011
I don't think your
wife would approve.

824
00:37:49,047 --> 00:37:51,746
Who cares? She hasn't
touched my lobes in months.

825
00:37:51,786 --> 00:37:52,754
I can tell.

826
00:37:52,788 --> 00:37:53,915
Oh, I need you.

827
00:37:53,957 --> 00:37:56,291
What you need is a cold shower!

828
00:37:56,328 --> 00:37:58,195
What a good idea.

829
00:37:58,232 --> 00:38:00,168
Why, you can scrub my back.

830
00:38:00,202 --> 00:38:01,796
- What if...
- Yes?

831
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:02,738
I told you...

832
00:38:02,841 --> 00:38:03,740
Yes?

833
00:38:03,843 --> 00:38:05,403
I hate Slug-o-Cola?

834
00:38:05,446 --> 00:38:08,117
Oh, so do I!

835
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:10,846
Oh, you torture me.

836
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:11,879
Stay away...

837
00:38:11,925 --> 00:38:12,915
Stay away?

838
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,928
- Or...
- Or what?

839
00:38:13,962 --> 00:38:14,987
Or I'll jump.

840
00:38:15,031 --> 00:38:16,967
I'll catch you.

841
00:38:20,842 --> 00:38:22,835
Let go of that man!

842
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,848
I'm trying.

843
00:38:23,882 --> 00:38:25,111
Would you please leave?

844
00:38:25,151 --> 00:38:26,619
You're making Lumba nervous.

845
00:38:26,653 --> 00:38:29,523
His name's not Lumba,
it's Quark

846
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:31,529
and he's a male.

847
00:38:31,563 --> 00:38:34,126
A male?

848
00:38:34,169 --> 00:38:35,660
How pitiful.

849
00:38:35,705 --> 00:38:39,406
Zek must be truly desperate.

850
00:38:39,446 --> 00:38:41,279
Is this true?

851
00:38:41,316 --> 00:38:43,115
You're... a man?

852
00:38:43,153 --> 00:38:44,986
Do I look like a man?

853
00:38:45,024 --> 00:38:48,326
Nice try, Quark,
but it's not going to work.

854
00:38:48,364 --> 00:38:50,995
He's the station's
bartender.

855
00:38:51,036 --> 00:38:53,529
Don't listen to him,
hot lobes.

856
00:38:53,574 --> 00:38:56,944
I'm as female as they come

857
00:38:56,981 --> 00:39:00,442
and I'm going
to prove it to you.

858
00:39:05,899 --> 00:39:07,299
Well?

859
00:39:07,335 --> 00:39:09,737
Well, I'm... not sure.

860
00:39:14,917 --> 00:39:16,546
Oh...

861
00:39:16,586 --> 00:39:18,579
all right.

862
00:39:27,775 --> 00:39:30,075
Now are you sure?

863
00:39:30,114 --> 00:39:32,677
Oh... completely.

864
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:36,523
I tell you
that is not a female!

865
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,625
Well, she's close enough
for me.

866
00:39:44,042 --> 00:39:46,444
Oh, come, my dear.

867
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,040
Let's go tell Zek

868
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:51,021
that I'm going to do
everything in my power

869
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:53,721
to make sure
he remains Grand Nagus.

870
00:39:53,761 --> 00:39:55,127
But...

871
00:39:55,164 --> 00:39:56,223
why?

872
00:39:56,266 --> 00:40:00,263
Because that's what Lumba wants.

873
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,656
His name's Quark.

874
00:40:26,092 --> 00:40:27,755
Interesting ring.

875
00:40:29,065 --> 00:40:30,226
It was a gift.

876
00:40:31,703 --> 00:40:35,575
Poor Nilva...
such a lovely man but so lonely.

877
00:40:36,746 --> 00:40:38,237
Really?

878
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:41,916
There was a sweetness to him...

879
00:40:41,991 --> 00:40:44,223
and also a strength.

880
00:40:44,262 --> 00:40:46,459
Sometimes, he'd get
this little glint in his eye...

881
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:50,932
You know what I mean.

882
00:40:51,009 --> 00:40:53,172
Not really...

883
00:40:53,213 --> 00:40:56,617
but I'm glad you had
a pleasant evening.

884
00:40:56,653 --> 00:40:58,816
You're mocking me, aren't you?

885
00:41:00,094 --> 00:41:03,294
And you're being
a little overly sensitive.

886
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:05,896
I've only been a male again
for six hours.

887
00:41:05,972 --> 00:41:09,308
My hormones must still be
out of balance.

888
00:41:09,345 --> 00:41:11,908
My emotions are raging
out of control.

889
00:41:11,984 --> 00:41:15,286
Is there anything I can do?

890
00:41:16,626 --> 00:41:19,792
Would you mind...

891
00:41:19,832 --> 00:41:23,168
giving me... a hug?

892
00:41:23,206 --> 00:41:24,674
A hug?

893
00:41:24,709 --> 00:41:26,576
Just a small one.

894
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:32,720
Thank you!

895
00:41:42,478 --> 00:41:44,971
I hope we're not
interrupting anything.

896
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,849
Uh, excuse me.

897
00:41:47,855 --> 00:41:50,189
We just wanted
to say good-bye

898
00:41:50,227 --> 00:41:51,890
before we go back
to Ferenginar.

899
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:53,524
Where the rivers run with muck

900
00:41:53,567 --> 00:41:56,801
and the streets
are swarming with happy females.

901
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:00,006
And where, if all
goes according to plan

902
00:42:00,114 --> 00:42:01,879
the FCA Commissioners

903
00:42:01,916 --> 00:42:05,617
will once again
proclaim me Grand Nagus.

904
00:42:05,658 --> 00:42:06,956
That would be nice, but Brunt's

905
00:42:07,061 --> 00:42:08,529
going to fight
you at every turn.

906
00:42:08,563 --> 00:42:10,590
Ah, I wouldn't have
it any other way.

907
00:42:10,634 --> 00:42:13,197
I'm glad we have
Nilva on our side

908
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,973
and we have you
to thank for that, Quark.

909
00:42:16,046 --> 00:42:18,643
Will you forgive me, Moogie?

910
00:42:19,686 --> 00:42:21,315
Of course I do.

911
00:42:21,356 --> 00:42:23,349
You may be a lousy son

912
00:42:23,393 --> 00:42:26,092
but you made
a wonderful daughter.

913
00:42:28,236 --> 00:42:30,206
I hope the experience
taught you something.

914
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,903
It made me more compassionate

915
00:42:31,943 --> 00:42:34,881
more empathetic,
more nurturing.

916
00:42:34,916 --> 00:42:37,386
I feel like I'm trapped
in my worst nightmare.

917
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:38,480
Don't worry.

918
00:42:38,523 --> 00:42:40,720
I'm sure it won't last.

919
00:42:40,761 --> 00:42:44,360
You'll be back to your
old self in no time.

920
00:42:49,545 --> 00:42:50,979
Mmm...

921
00:43:00,234 --> 00:43:02,466
You are so... lucky.

922
00:43:02,505 --> 00:43:03,564
Oh.

923
00:43:03,607 --> 00:43:05,839
No man ever gave me a ring.

924
00:43:07,815 --> 00:43:08,748
Quark?

925
00:43:09,819 --> 00:43:11,448
Aluura...

926
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:12,752
I read the book.

927
00:43:12,792 --> 00:43:14,283
What book?

928
00:43:14,328 --> 00:43:16,856
You know, Oo-mox <i>for Fun...</i>

929
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,129
You shouldn't be
wasting your time

930
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:19,138
reading that kind of trash.

931
00:43:19,172 --> 00:43:20,971
But you told me to...

932
00:43:21,008 --> 00:43:22,408
Forget what I told you.

933
00:43:22,444 --> 00:43:24,209
It was wrong and I apologize.

934
00:43:24,248 --> 00:43:26,309
You are a wonderful employee

935
00:43:26,352 --> 00:43:28,618
and I'm lucky
to have you working for me.

936
00:43:28,657 --> 00:43:32,893
In fact, as of today,
I'm giving you a raise...

937
00:43:32,932 --> 00:43:35,425
another two slips
of latinum a week.

938
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:36,563
Really?

939
00:43:36,606 --> 00:43:39,237
It's the least I can do.

940
00:43:41,048 --> 00:43:42,414
That's too bad.

941
00:43:42,451 --> 00:43:45,014
All right, make it three.

942
00:43:45,056 --> 00:43:46,319
No, it's not that.

943
00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:47,292
Then what?

944
00:43:48,964 --> 00:43:50,991
It's just that...

945
00:43:51,034 --> 00:43:52,936
<i>oo-mox</i> sounded like fun...

946
00:43:52,972 --> 00:43:55,671
the tympanic tickle

947
00:43:55,711 --> 00:43:57,077
the eustachian tube rub

948
00:43:57,113 --> 00:44:00,051
the... auditory nerve nibble...

949
00:44:01,088 --> 00:44:03,787
But if that's the way
you feel about it...

950
00:44:03,827 --> 00:44:06,731
That is exactly
the way I feel about it.

951
00:44:13,847 --> 00:44:15,213
What am I saying?

952
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:16,275
Aluura?

953
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:17,651
Wait.
