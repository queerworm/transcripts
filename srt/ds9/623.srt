1
00:00:01,585 --> 00:00:06,047
I am truly impressed,
and I'm not easily impressed.

2
00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:08,717
In all my years as the
proprietor of Quark's Bar

3
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:11,010
Grill, Gaming House
and Holosuite Arcade

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,807
I have never seen such a glowing
employee performance report.

5
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:17,977
I mean, look at this.

6
00:00:17,977 --> 00:00:20,771
In three months,
no customer has filed

7
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:23,315
a<i> single</i> complaint
against you.

8
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:26,861
You haven't spilled a drink,
mixed up a food order

9
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:28,737
or shortchanged a bill.

10
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:32,032
I take my job
very seriously.

11
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,451
And, yet, you always manage
to wear a friendly smile.

12
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,662
That's because
I like my work.

13
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,455
I'm happy to be here.

14
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:40,332
And it shows.

15
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:42,877
The customers love you.

16
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:45,379
Your fellow dabo girls
love you.

17
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,589
Even the Ferengi waiters
sing your praises

18
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:48,674
and you know why?

19
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:50,467
Because you're nice.

20
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,928
I try to be.

21
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,390
You're nice to
the customers.

22
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,684
You're nice to
the dabo girls.

23
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:01,729
You're nice to the
Ferengi waiters.

24
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:04,398
You're nice to everyone...

25
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,234
<i>almost</i> everyone.

26
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,070
You mean,
I've offended someone?

27
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,364
Look closely, Aluura.

28
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:15,409
Can't you see the
pain in my eyes?

29
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,327
But I'm always nice to you.

30
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:21,081
I think you
could be nicer.

31
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,792
How much nicer?

32
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:36,471
Oo-mox<i> for Fun and Profit?</i>

33
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:39,349
It's a quick read.

34
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:42,061
Oh...

35
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:44,855
you... want me to be...

36
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,398
<i>nice.</i>

37
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:48,108
Let's face it.

38
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,485
The customers, the dabo
girls, the Ferengi waiters--

39
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,195
they didn't hire you

40
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,073
and, uh...

41
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:56,324
they can't fire you.

42
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,704
You wouldn't.

43
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:05,375
Would you?

44
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,794
Read the book.

45
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:07,753

Brother...

47
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:10,213
we need to talk.

48
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,424
Go away.
I'm in the middle
of a meeting.

49
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:13,550
But it's important.

50
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,010
So is this meeting.

51
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,429
It's about
our mother.

52
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,056
How many times
have I told you

53
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:22,142
not to mention Moogie
when I'm... working?

54
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,435
Sorry

55
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,395
but I tried contacting
her this morning

56
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,939
and I couldn't
get through.

57
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:29,274
She's probably off
visiting the Grand Nagus.

58
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,818
I tried the
Tower of Commerce.

59
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:32,027
There was no answer
there either.

60
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:33,821
They're probably
on vacation.

61
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,196
Now, leave me alone.

62
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:36,406
I'm trying to concentrate.

63
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,158
Brother, you
don't understand.

64
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,701
I can't get a hold of
<i>anyone</i> on Ferenginar--

65
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,745
not Cousin Gaila,
not Lek.

66
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,246
I tell you, something's
very wrong.

67
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,539
(<i> whispering</i> ):
All right.

68
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,376
We will continue this later.

69
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:51,130
In the meantime,
you have some reading to do.

70
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,840
Hello, Aluura.

71
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,427
She's so nice.

72
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:00,514
We'll see.

73
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,977
A Dominion invasion
of Ferenginar?

74
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:06,394
ROM:
Think of the terrible
repercussions

75
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,271
to the Alpha Quadrant.

76
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,731
WORF:
I cannot think of<i> any.</i>

77
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,566
How could the Dominion
invade Ferenginar

78
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,527
without first conquering
the surrounding systems

79
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,612
like Clarus and Irtok?

80
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,947
Brother, did
you hear that?

81
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:19,158
They've captured
Irtok, as well.

82
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:20,784
That's not what I said.

83
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,494
There are no reports
of Dominion activity

84
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,038
anywhere near that sector.

85
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:25,747
Why can't we get through
to Ferenginar?

86
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:29,710
Moogie, the Nagus,
Cousin Gaila...
they're all dead.

87
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,795
You don't know that,
Rom, but<i> something</i>

88
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,839
is definitely wrong
on Ferenginar.

89
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,256
We'll see
what we can find out.

90
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,550
DAX:
Captain

91
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,426
a Ferengi ship is
approaching the station

92
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,261
requesting permission
to dock.

93
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,056
It's Grand Nagus Zek...

94
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:44,265
and your mother is with him.

95
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,309
They're alive!

96
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,896
Nice work.

97
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,744
Quark, Rom!

98
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,037
It's good

99
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:06,538
to see you boys.

100
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:09,290
It's good to see you,
too, Nagus.

101
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,625
Come along, my dear.

102
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,712
(<i> chuckles</i> )

103
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:16,339
Moogie...

104
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,760
I was so worried.

105
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,553
You're a good son.

106
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,097
I was worried, too.

107
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:24,639
And you're a good<i> liar.</i>

108
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,934
Moogie, do you think
it's a good idea

109
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:29,103
to be wearing
clothes in public?

110
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:30,520
He's right.

111
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,607
What if one
of my Ferengi waiters sees you?

112
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,442
I hope they<i> do.</i>

113
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:36,818
Tell them, Zekkie.

114
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,570
No, you go right ahead,
my dear.

115
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,447
No, it should really
come from you.

116
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,282
Would someone please tell me
what's going on?

117
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:46,286
It's one of those
good news/bad news
type of things.

118
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,662
Give him the
good news first.

119
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,748
If you insist.

120
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,875
Three days ago, I
added a new amendment

121
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,211
to the Ferengi Bill
of Opportunities

122
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:59,340
giving females the
right to wear clothes.

123
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,634
In public?

124
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,177
Anywhere we want.

125
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:05,513
That<i> can't</i> be the good news.

126
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:09,017
If Ferengi females
can wear clothes in public

127
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,644
then they can leave their homes.

128
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,063
If they can leave their homes,
they can go to work.

129
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:16,108
If they go to work,
they can make profit.

130
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:17,609
What's the matter, Quark--

131
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:19,486
afraid of a
little competition?

132
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:20,612
Are you<i> sure</i>

133
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,363
that's the good news?

134
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,949
It sounds good to me.

135
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:26,451
Oh, now you see
why I like him best?

136
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,579
Face it, Quark--
it's good business.

137
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:33,875
For thousands of years,
Ferenginar has allowed

138
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:38,546
a<i> valuable</i> resource
to go to waste.

139
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,508
Females-- a valuable
resource?

140
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:44,469
They make up 53.5 percent
of the population

141
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,471
and contribute
virtually nothing

142
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,640
to gross planetary
income.

143
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,644
<i>I</i> say it's time they started
pulling their own weight.

144
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,313
Better tell me
the bad news.

145
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:56,355
It might cheer me up.

146
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:57,607
I doubt it.

147
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,943
The moment
fully clothed females

148
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:03,197
started appearing
on the streets of Ferenginar

149
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:05,824
financial chaos erupted
all over the planet.

150
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:08,160
That explains
the communications blackout.

151
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,953
ZEK:
There was so much
buying and selling

152
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,496
throughout the Alliance

153
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:15,583
that the entire planetary
communications grid shut down.

154
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,336
If there's trouble
on Ferenginar

155
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:19,546
what are you doing here?

156
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,466
I've been deposed.

157
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,345
I'm no longer Grand Nagus.

158
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:29,097
Then who is?

159
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,932
Who do you think?

160
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,768
Brunt.

161
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,520
Grand Nagus Brunt?

162
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,771

Brunt hates us.

MOOGIE:
Well, don't
start panicking.

167
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,030
The Ferengi Commerce
Authority hasn't
confirmed him yet.

168
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,156
And they won't

169
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,367
for three
more days.

170
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:52,579
Boys, together we're going
to reconquer an empire

171
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,998

Small... but lovely.

175
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,720
As of this moment

176
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,056
I declare this site

00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,563
Brunt is the new Nagus?

Then it becomes official.

183
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,110
I'm not worried.

184
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,406
I have a secret weapon--
your mother.

185
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:33,407
(<i> chuckling</i> )

186
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,450
Now, here's the plan:

187
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,828
One, we contact
every FCA Commissioner

188
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,789
and invite them to the station
for a meeting.

189
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:45,001
Two, Ishka runs the meeting.

190
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,461
Oh, they'll love that.

191
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:49,423
Maybe not at first,
but she'll win them over

192
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:52,426
using her vast
financial knowledge

193
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:55,053
and her keen instinct
for profit.

194
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:59,433
She'll prove once
and for all that allowing

195
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:02,519
females to wear clothing

196
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,272
is the first step
toward a healthier

197
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,857
and more prosperous
Ferengi economy.

198
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,359
And<i> three...</i>

199
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:12,779
What was three
again, my dear?

200
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,532
The FCA Commissioners
reinstate you

201
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,200
as Nagus.

202
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,078
And who could ask
for a happier ending than that?

203
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,663
But that's only the
beginning, lobekins.

204
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,458
I predict that one day

205
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,502
a female will enter
the Tower of Commerce

206
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,670
climb the 40
flights of stairs

207
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,631
to the Chamber
of Opportunity

208
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,217
and take her rightful place

209
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:39,013
as Grand Nagus
of the Ferengi Alliance.

210
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,517
Don't look at<i> me.</i>

211
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:43,726
It was<i> your</i> amendment.

212
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,022
Nagus, you remember
my son, Nog, don't you?

213
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,442
He's the first Ferengi
to join Starfleet.

214
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,902
I'll try not to hold that
against him.

215
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:57,031
And this is my wife, Leeta.

216
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,867
I've heard...
so much about you.

217
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,869
Would you like to hear more?

218
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:04,581
Remember,
she's Rom's wife.

219
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,583
Meaning what?

220
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,335
Meaning she's broke.

221
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:13,632
She doesn't look broke
to me.

222
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:14,841
<i>Zekkie...</i>

223
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,510
(<i> laughing</i> ):
Just having

224
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,386
a little harmless fun,
my sweet.

225
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,720
(<i> laughing</i> )

226
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,389
Now, Quark,
you and your brother

227
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,890
get rid of some
of this furniture

228
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,643
and, you, get three

229
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:27,604
subspace transceivers off my
ship and set them up in here.

230
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:30,440
And where's my beetle snuff?

231
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,112
Grand Nagus<i> Brunt.</i>

232
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:43,161
Good afternoon, I'm calling
on behalf of Grand Nagus Zek.

233
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,372
The Nagus summons you
to a meeting here

234
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:46,789
on Deep Space 9.

235
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,958
He's counting on your support.

236
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,212
You'll be presented with some
very interesting financial data.

237
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,672
There's profit
to be earned.

238
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:55,382
And the Nagus wants you
to share

239
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,133
in these lucrative
opportunities.

240
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,261
Yes, I'm talking
about the Grand Nagus.

241
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,847
No, not Brunt.

242
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,558
Grand Nagus<i> Zek.</i>

243
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,184
Who said he was dead?

244
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,603
Wait. Don't end
the transmission.

245
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:11,105
Hello? Hello?
Where'd he go?

246
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:14,484
I know all about the 94th Rule
of Acquisition.

247
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:17,028
I know-- females and finances
don't mix.

248
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:20,073
But that can be interpreted
in many different ways.

249
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,824
Hello? Hello?

250
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,202
That's not a very nice thing
to say about the Nagus.

251
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:25,453
I beg your pardon?

252
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,414
There's no need to be insulting.

253
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,290
Hello?
Hello? Hello?

254
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,751
That female
happens to be my mother!

255
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:33,878
Hello?

256
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,923
Are you sure you contacted

257
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,966
every Commissioner on this list?

258
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,843
All 432 of them.

259
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:44,222
And you could only convince
one of them to attend a meeting?

260
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:47,141
Maybe if we made some
follow-up calls.

261
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:50,978
I helped every one
of those people earn a fortune!

262
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:53,856
And this is
how they repay me?

263
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,275
What a bunch of ingrates.

264
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,569
Well, the news
isn't all bad.

265
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,654
The Commissioner
who's agreed to come--

266
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:00,863
it's Nilva.

267
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,907
The Chairman of Slug-o-Cola.

268
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,952
ISHKA:
He's a very powerful
and influential voice

269
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,704
within the FCA.

270
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:11,916
Unfortunately, he's
an influential voice
for the status quo.

271
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,543
I don't think
Slug-o-Cola

272
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:15,295
has changed its advertising
slogan in 300 years.

273
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,837
♪ Drink Slug-o-Cola ♪

274
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,173
ALL:
♪ ...the slimiest cola
in the galaxy. ♪

275
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:22,343
QUARK:
Why would Nilva agree
to come to the meeting?

276
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:25,722
I'm not sure, but if I can
convince him to support Zek

277
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:27,932
other Commissioners
will follow.

278
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,059
Well, it's a
start, at least.

279
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,187
See? I told you
it was too early to panic.

280
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,940
Care to place a wager
on that?

281
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,526
ROM:
Grand Nagus Brunt!

282
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,446
ZEK:
<i>Acting</i> Grand
Nagus Brunt.

283
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,531
ISHKA:
<i>Now</i> you can panic.

284
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,123
I'll take an Eelwasser.

285
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:53,708
No ice.

286
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,378
ZEK:
What are you

287
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,837
doing here, Brunt?

288
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:04,135
That's<i> Grand Nagus</i> Brunt.

289
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:06,220
<i>Acting</i> Grand Nagus.

290
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,098
Would someone
please tell that female

291
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,100
to take off those clothes?

292
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,727
It's disgusting.

293
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:15,396
Get used to it,
limp lobes.

294
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,732
This is the future.

295
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,694
Over my dead body.

296
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,987
If that's what it takes.

297
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,782
ROM:
I don't suppose you're
here to reminisce

298
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,826
about the time
you helped my
brother and me

299
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:29,661
rescue Moogie
from the Dominion.

300
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:32,288
You're right,
that's not why I'm here.

301
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,790
Though I find it ironic

302
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,250
that helping
to rescue your mother

303
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,713
was the first step
on my road to becoming Nagus.

304
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,548
Don't remind me.

305
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:45,176
I<i> never</i> should have
given you your job back
with the FCA.

306
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,553
But you did.

307
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,847
And as a liquidator,
I was able to bribe my way

308
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:50,682
back into a position of power.

309
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,933
That<i> is</i> ironic.

310
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,228
Face it, Zek.

311
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,771
It's over.

312
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,272
You're finished...

313
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,441
bankrupt.

314
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:03,737
I'm going to liquidate you.

315
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,449
Cancel that Eelwasser.

316
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,619
And get me a...

317
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,872
Slug-o-Cola instead.

318
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,667
On second thought...

319
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:21,713
I'll just wait till
Chairman Nilva gets here.

320
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:24,382
I'm sure he'll be happy
to provide his new Nagus

321
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:25,800
with all the Slug-o-Cola

322
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,967
I can drink.

323
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,720
How did you know
Nilva was coming here?

324
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,930
Because it's my
business to know.

325
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,515
Go on.

326
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,350
Have your
little meeting.

327
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,228
Whatever you offer
Nilva, I'll double it.

328
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:38,730
That's it!

329
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,314
Get out of my bar.

330
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:43,818
You dare threaten
your Nagus?

331
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:45,278
<i>Acting</i> Nagus.

332
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,154
You may liquidate us tomorrow

333
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:49,783
but right now,
this is still my establishment.

334
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:52,201
Now, get out
before I kick you out.

335
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:55,705
I'm going to make
you a pauper.

336
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:59,125
Uri'lash...
we're leaving.

337
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:03,212
Say good-bye to these
<i>poor</i> people.

338
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,047
Out.

339
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,766
ZEK:
My boy, I'm proud of you.

340
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:16,016
So am I.

341
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,435
Me, too.

342
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:20,563
I just kicked the Grand
Nagus out of my bar.

343
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,607
OTHERS:
<i>Acting</i> Grand Nagus.

344
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,108
Whatever.

345
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,653
I need to lie down.

346
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,119
You busy, Quark?

347
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,329
Busy?

348
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,997
Me?

349
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,334
Nah. I'm just lying here
wondering if it's not too late

350
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,503
for me to start
a new life somewhere.

351
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:47,715
Oh, Quark, there's nothing wrong
with your life.

352
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,425
I'm sorry.
I stand corrected.

353
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,052
You're overreacting.
Whatever you say.

354
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,096
Reminds me of when
you were a lobling.

355
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,975
You were always
such a miserable child.

356
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,268
Moogie, leave me alone.

357
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,145
I'm your mother;
I can't leave you alone.

358
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,396
Try!

359
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,690
Come on, on your feet.

360
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,107
Zekkie's waiting for you
in the bar.

361
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,776
Now what?

362
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,653
He feels like playing
a game of<i> tongo.</i>

363
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:11,322
We're all facing banishment
from Ferengi society

364
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,699
and he wants
to play<i> tongo?</i>

365
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,617
He wants to play<i> tongo.</i>

366
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,118
I want to have
a late-night snack.

367
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,872
You want to lie here
feeling sorry for yourself.

368
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:21,624
We all deal with stress
in different ways.

369
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,793
Any fresh tube grubs around?

370
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,920
How can you eat
at a time like this?

371
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,338
It's simple.

372
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,048
You put one end
of the tube grub

373
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,550
between your
front teeth

374
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,134
and you suck
them right up.

375
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,803
You want tube grubs? Fine.

376
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,723
Enjoy.

377
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:37,932
These are minced.

378
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,225
I wanted fresh.

379
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,518
You know, this is
all your fault.

380
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:41,853
It's<i> my</i> fault

381
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:43,688
you don't have
fresh tube grubs?

382
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,648
I'm not talking
about tube grubs.

383
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,316
I'm talking about
Ferengi females

384
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:50,152
wearing clothes
and earning profit.

385
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,031
I'm talking about
Grand Nagus Brunt.

386
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:54,699
<i>Acting</i> Grand Nagus Brunt!

387
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,576
You're not fooling
me, Moogie.

388
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,703
You've been plotting
this all along.

389
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,204
Ever since you met Zek

390
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,789
you've been working on him

391
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,918
manipulating him,
whispering things in his ears

392
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:06,711
things like "Equality
for Females."

393
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:08,004
What's wrong with that?

394
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:09,672
I'll tell you what's
wrong with that.

395
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:12,466
You've ruined Zek's life,
your life, Rom's life.

396
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,134
As if you cared
about any of us.

397
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,803
It's your life
you're worried about.

398
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,346
You bet I'm worried.

399
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,099
Nobody else seems to care
what happens to me.

400
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,393
You come here to my station

401
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:24,311
take over my quarters,
make me

402
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,688
a part of your
subversive schemes...

403
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,273
What's the matter, Quark?

404
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,358
Are you afraid you
picked the wrong side?

405
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,736
You can always go
crawling to Brunt,
beg his forgiveness.

406
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,821
I don't want anything
to do with Brunt.

407
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,990
I want my old Nagus back!

408
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,199
Do you.

409
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,493
I want Zek to be
the way he used to be

410
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:43,122
before he met you,
before you twisted his thinking

411
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,374
with your-your...
your feminine wiles.

412
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:49,754
Before he met me, Zek was
a lonely, unhappy man.

413
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,505
But he was rich!

414
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,967
He was the most powerful
Ferengi alive.

415
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,843
Now what is he?
A puppet.

416
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,470
And you're the one
pulling the strings

417
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,139
making him dance
to your evil feminist tune.

418
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,182
You're the worst thing
that ever happened to Zek!

419
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,060
You're the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

420
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,104
In fact, you're the worst thing
that ever happened

421
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:07,939
to the entire
Ferengi Alliance!

422
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:09,649
Maybe I am!

423
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:12,819
But at least
I'm not like you.

424
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:16,739
A selfish, spineless,
ungrateful--

425
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:17,991
Don't forget miserable.

426
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:20,660
Miserable excuse for a son!

427
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,620
Is that the best
you can do?

428
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,204
I haven't even begun.

429
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,415
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

430
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,084
Why, you are
nothing but a...

431
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,460
why, you are... you--

432
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,211
Go ahead. Say it.

433
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,672
You're a...

434
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,173
I'm still waiting.

435
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,342
You're a... you're a...

436
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,511
(<i> yelling</i> ):
A... what?!

437
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,180
(<i> thud</i> )

438
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,307
Moogie...

439
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,977
Moogie? Moogie!

440
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,312
Moogie?

441
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,816
Moogie? Moogie?

442
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,986
ROM:
Moogie...

443
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:56,403
please don't die.

444
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,364
She's not going to die.

445
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,949
She's going
to get better.

446
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:02,910
I hope so... for my sake...

447
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,578
for her sake...

448
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,706
for the sake
of the entire

449
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:09,000
Ferengi Alliance,
and most of all

450
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,460
I hope she gets better
for your sake, Quark

451
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,337
because if she<i> doesn't--</i>

452
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,381
What did I do?

453
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,591
That's exactly the question
I keep asking myself!

454
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,135
What did you do to her?!

455
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,469
I told you.

456
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,637
She said she was hungry.

457
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,263
I gave her some tube grubs.

458
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,641
She thanked me... and
then she collapsed.

459
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,810
I wish you'd stop
making me relive it.

460
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,228
Are you sure you didn't
do or say anything

461
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,563
that might have upset her?

462
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,272
I don't want to
talk about it anymore.

463
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,483
What's wrong, Quark?
Your conscience bothering you?

464
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,985
I haven't done
anything wrong.

465
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:37,444
That's not
what your mother says.

466
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,363
ROM:
Doctor... how's Moogie?

467
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,991
Will she live?
Oh, yes, she'll live.

468
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,868
She needed a new heart,
and it's functioning normally

469
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:46,120
but she's going to need
a few days complete rest.

470
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:51,125
And she'll need to be kept
far away from him.

471
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,793
And why is that, Doctor?

472
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,879
I'm not sure exactly.

473
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,630
All I do know
is that she keeps repeating

474
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,298
the same phrase
over and over:

475
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:01,761
"It's all Quark's fault.
It's all Quark's fault."

476
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:05,639
I wonder what she
means by that.

477
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:17,068
And, uh... then I...

478
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:19,028
I accused her of being

479
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,572
the worst thing that ever
happened to the Ferengi Alliance

480
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:26,869
and she clutched her chest
and collapsed.

481
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:29,122
Moogie and I argue all the time.

482
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,998
It's our way
of showing affection.

483
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:34,293
Well, if you ask me, Quark,
the worst thing

484
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:38,089
that ever happened
to the Ferengi Alliance is you.

485
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:40,883
I'm sorry.

486
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,218
Well, I suppose we
should contact Nilva

487
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,803
and tell him the meeting
has to be postponed.

488
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,097
We can't postpone
the meeting!

489
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:50,017
In two days, the FCA
is going to confirm Brunt

490
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,270
as the new Grand Nagus.

491
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,981
Boy, when things
go wrong...

492
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:57,858
BRUNT:
The only thing to do

493
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:01,946
is to get down on your knees
and beg for mercy.

494
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,365
Who knows?

495
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:08,995
You might find me
in a charitable mood.

496
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:11,330
By the time
I get through with you

497
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,083
<i>you're</i> the one
who's going to need charity.

498
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,669
Such brave words...

499
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,963
yet so empty.

500
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:21,007
I was very relieved

501
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:24,302
to hear your mother
is going to be all right.

502
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:27,013
Of course,
it doesn't do you much good.

503
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:30,099
Nilva will be
arriving tonight

504
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:34,103
expecting to meet
a brilliant Ferengi female.

505
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:36,354
Do you know any?

506
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:38,524
I mean, besides Ishka?

507
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,151
I certainly don't.

508
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:42,028
(<i> grunting</i> )

509
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,447
How...

510
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:48,034
pitiful.

511
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:50,536
One day you're
the Grand Nagus

512
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:53,413
of the Ferengi Alliance,
and the next

513
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:57,668
you're nothing but a
common barroom brawler.

514
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:59,253
You see what happens

515
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:02,548
when you put your
faith in a female?

516
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:15,811
What about Leeta?

517
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,021
What about her?

518
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:18,438
Maybe she could
meet with Nilva.

519
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,649
She handles my finances,
and she's a female.

520
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,360
And a very beautiful one
at that.

521
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,154
But Nilva's expecting
to meet with a<i> Ferengi</i> female.

522
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:26,572
We'll never get one here
in time.

523
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,532
We're doomed.
No, we're not.

524
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:31,535
You think if Ishka were here,
she'd give up?

525
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,537
If she were here, we
wouldn't have a problem.

526
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,788
That's not my point.

527
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:37,041
Your mother would
never accept defeat.

528
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:40,460
If she couldn't find
another female, she'd...

529
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,255
she'd... she'd...

530
00:23:42,255 --> 00:23:43,672
She'd what?

531
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,966
She'd make one.

532
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,051
You mean a hologram?

533
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:49,929
Better than a hologram.

534
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:52,556
What could be better
than a hologram?

535
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,141
You.

536
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:08,614
ROM:
Dr. Bashir certainly did
a wonderful job on you.

537
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:11,325
I'd call the operation
a complete success.

538
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:14,452
LEETA:
It must've been a
very delicate procedure.

539
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:16,538

Tell me about it.

540
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,748
LEETA:
There.

541
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:31,345
Well, how do I look?

542
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:34,514
You look nice.

543
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:35,891
Nice?

544
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,601
That's all?

545
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,395
<i>Very</i> nice.

546
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:41,355
ZEK:
You may<i> look</i> 
like a female

547
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:43,983
but you have to do something
about that voice.

548
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:45,525
I'm trying!

549
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,987
(<i> in softer voice</i> ):
I-I mean... I'm trying.

550
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,072
Well, try<i> harder.</i>

551
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:51,282
And stop looking down.

552
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:53,867
I need to see
what I look like.

553
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,328
Someone get me a mirror.

554
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:05,921
You see, Brother?
You look<i> lovely.</i>

555
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:06,880
(<i> bawling</i> )

556
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,174
There go his hormones.

557
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:09,342
You mean<i> her</i> hormones?

558
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:11,677
Ta-take it away!
Take it away!

559
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:13,220
Oh, I'm sorry.

560
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,098
(<i> voice breaking</i> ):
I just feel so-so different.

561
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:17,850
Would you stop staring

562
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,310
at your chest?

563
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,645
I'm not staring at my chest.

564
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,563
I'm staring at my hips.

565
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,565
Aren't they too big?

566
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:26,692
Your hips are fine.

567
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,735
Now, let's get
down to business.

568
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:32,323
These are your mother's notes
for her meeting with Nilva.

569
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:35,951
Study them carefully.

All these facts

575
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:50,049
they're too much
for me to remember.

576
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:51,967
Oh, nonsense.

577
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:55,553
You just need a little time
to practice your presentation.

578
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:58,849
And while you're at it,
we need to practice
your walk.

579
00:25:58,849 --> 00:25:59,975
What's wrong
with my walk?

580
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,269
You're... lumbering.

581
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,937
This is never going
to work.

582
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:06,440
ROM:
Don't cry, Brother.

583
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,816
Here. Let
me show you.

584
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,443
Watch carefully.

585
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,616
You see, it's
more of a glide.

586
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:19,745
That's...<i> good.</i>

587
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:22,373
And when you sit, make sure
your knees are touching

588
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:25,084
and don't forget
to relax your shoulders

589
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,253
but keep your bottom tight.

590
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,465
What?

591
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:34,176
He's the one that should be
wearing the dress.

592
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:35,677
Why me?

593
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,430
(<i> sighs</i> )

594
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,723
You're so adorable...

595
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,768
and... complicated.

596
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,728
Maybe it's not too late.

597
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,980
Come on, Brother,
I'll take you to Dr. Bashir.

598
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,149
ZEK:
Forget it, Quark.

599
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,318
Rom may make
a better female than you

600
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:55,531
but when it comes to business,
you're the better Ferengi.

601
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:58,284
Looks like your stupidity
has saved you again.

602
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:00,327
It comes in
handy sometimes.

603
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:03,663
I can do this.

604
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:06,166
It's only one meeting.

605
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:09,169
I can be a female
for one meeting...

606
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,421
can't I?

607
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:12,131
<i>Not</i> if you're lumbering.

608
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,882
I'll conduct the
meeting sitting down.

00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,509

Tighten your bottom.

610
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:19,388
Well,<i> I</i> think you're
doing wonderfully, my dear.

611
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:21,223
I'm proud of you.

612
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,640
I'm sorry.

613
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:26,604
You know,
you may walk like a man

614
00:27:26,604 --> 00:27:30,608
but you make
a very attractive female.

615
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:32,901
Confusing, isn't it?

616
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,194
Not to me.

617
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,821
He's here.
He's on the station.

618
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:36,780
Who is?

619
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,324
Nilva.

620
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:40,700
But he's not supposed
to arrive until tomorrow.

621
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,328
That Nilva, he's
a tricky one

622
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:44,079
but he makes
a good cola.

623
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,331
ROM:
What do we do?

624
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:47,207
No, I-I can't
meet Nilva now.

625
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:50,085
I'm still lumbering.
You look very nice.

626
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,630
Nog, I want you
to escort the chairman
to his quarters.

627
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,756
Tell him I'll meet him
for dinner tonight.

628
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,800
Yeah.
Oh, what if he asks about Ishka?

629
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,512
Tell him that
Ishka is sick

630
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:01,388
but that, tomorrow,
he'll be meeting

631
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:04,475
with my other female
financial advisor...

632
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:07,853

633
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,438

634
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:11,357
Right.

635
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:12,732
Lumba?

636
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:16,320
You'd better start memorizing
those notes.

637

First, we need
to practice your walking.

638

And your sitting.

639
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,699
And you'd better work
on that voice.

640
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:23,118
Any other comments?

641
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,245
Has anyone ever told you

642
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:28,081
that you have lovely eyes?

643
00:28:34,672 --> 00:28:36,089
Here.

644
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,383
Have a Slug-o-Cola.

645
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:38,717
Thank you.

646
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,178
Welcome to Deep Space 9,
Chairman Nilva.

647
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:43,013
You drink Slug-o-Cola,
don't you?

648
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:45,224
The slimiest cola in the galaxy?

649
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:46,642
Doesn't everybody?

Good boy.

652
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,187
Now, take me to Zek.

653
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:51,771
Zek wanted me
to take you to--

654
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:52,981
Oh, don't argue with me.

655
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,983
Drink your cola
and lead the way.

656
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,736
Um... uh...

657
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:05,244
Uh...

658
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:08,288
You sure you don't want
to stop by your quarters
and freshen up?

659
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,999
Not before I meet
this female advisor of Zek's.

00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:20,092
Nilva, how nice
to see you again.

<i>Acting</i> Grand
Nagus Brunt.

665
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:25,180
Well, I had a feeling
I might find you here.

00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,390
(<i> chuckles</i> )

667
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,975
I thought
after your meeting with Zek

668
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:31,144
we could have
a little chat.

669
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,605
Oh, of course.

670
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:35,774
But I've really come
to meet this Ishka female.

671
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,359
Haven't you heard?

672
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,985
Ishka's in the Infirmary.

673
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:41,113
She's in no position
to meet anyone.

674
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,573
Which is why
you'll be meeting

675
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:45,325
with another one of Zek's
financial advisors.

676
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,077
Her name is Lumba.

677
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:48,954
Never heard of her.

678
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:52,374
Oh, Zek has two
female advisors?

679
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:54,376
I didn't know there were
two Ferengi females

680
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:56,378
on the station.

681
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:57,921
Well, what are
we waiting for?

682
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,299
Let's go meet
this other female.

683
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,592
Are you sure you
wouldn't like me

684
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:03,051
to show you around
the station first?

685
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:06,513
I want to meet Lumba.

686
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:13,270
Lumba?

687
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,021
Let's try it again.

My name is Lumba.

690
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,787
You must be
Chairman Nilva.

691
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:32,831
Zek has told me
so much about you...

692
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:33,749
Ow!

693
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:35,167
What's wrong now?

694
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,961
It's these earrings,
they're killing me.

695
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,588
Do I have
to wear them?

696
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:42,090
No woman is complete
without earrings.

697
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,551
Why does everyone
keep looking at me?

698
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:47,304
I'm going to bed.
Now?

699
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:49,515
I'm exhausted.
If I don't get any sleep,

700
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:51,475
I'll never make it
through tomorrow's meeting.

Oh, don't worry.

I brought enough for everyone.

He insisted on seeing
you immediately.

00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:14,540
Why, you must be Lunga.

713
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,958
<i>Lumba.</i>

714
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:20,920
Oh, a clothed
female Ferengi--

715
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,715
and with your
approval, no less.

716
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:25,217
Oh, either you've been

717
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:28,178
inhaling too much
beetle snuff

718
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:32,808
or you're the greatest
visionary ever to sit atop

719
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:34,226
the Tower of Commerce.

720
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:36,102
Well, uh,
why don't you and I have

721
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:38,021
dinner tonight and try
to figure it out?

722
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:40,148
We can go to Quark's

723
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:44,695
and get some nice
juicy snail steaks.

724
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:46,946
You can meet with
Lumba tomorrow.

725
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:49,366
I'm afraid
that's not possible.

726
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:51,201
You see, I have to leave
first thing in the morning.

727
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:53,746
I'm due back
on Ferenginar
for an important

728
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:55,121
stockholder's meeting.

729
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:59,376
Oh, but those snail steaks
do sound tempting.

730
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:02,504
I know.

731
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:05,632
Why don't I have
dinner with Lumba?

732
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,217
Oh, with me?

733
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:09,887
Won't you feel uncomfortable
being seen

734
00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:12,264
in public with
a clothed female?

735
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:14,015
Well, of course, I will

736
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,726
but you and I
have earned

737
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:18,978
a lot of latinum
together over the years.

738
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:21,981
That should be worth
some small discomfort.

739
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:26,528
But Lumba better be
all you claim she is

740
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:31,116
or I'll have to
liquidate you myself.

741
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:34,787
(<i> laughing</i> )

742
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:37,330
Here. Let's eat.

743
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:48,759
Have fun.

744
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:06,276
Two snail steaks,
lightly seared.

745
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:08,528
Now, tell me something.

746
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:09,780
Doesn't wearing
all those clothes

747
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,364
make you feel like a deviant?

748
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:12,532
Not really.

749
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:13,951
And I'll tell you why.

750
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:16,912
Because, under
all these clothes

751
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:19,372
I know I'm totally naked.

752
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:21,374
I'll try to remember that.

753
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:24,920
Now, you'd better explain to me

754
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,964
how allowing females
to wear clothing

755
00:33:26,964 --> 00:33:30,968
is going to make me richer
than I already am.

756
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:33,929
I was hoping you were
going to ask me that.

757
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:35,806
You see this dress
I'm wearing?

758
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:37,891
Have you any idea

759
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:40,811
how much it would sell
for on Ferenginar?

760
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:43,229
Would someone please tell
me what they're saying?

761
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:45,357
Shh!
Shh!
Shh!

762
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,945
Let me see
if I understand.

763
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:54,741
Giving females the right
to wear clothing

764
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:58,662
allows them to... have pockets.

765
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:00,288
Once they have pockets

766
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,666
they're going to want
to fill them with latinum.

767
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:05,210
Which means they're going
to need jobs.

768
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,963
And once
they start earning latinum

769
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:10,340
they're going
to want to spend it.

770
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,176
Which means,
Ferenginar will be expanding

771
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,136
its workforce
and its consumer base

772
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,889
at the same time.

773
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:19,474
(<i> chuckling</i> )

774
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:22,310
Oh, there will be plenty
of profit for everyone.

775
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,647
When it comes to
profit, I'm your girl.

776
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:30,986
And... I'm sure
you could use

777
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:32,195
a little extra latinum.

778
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,197
Meaning what?

779
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:37,158
I read the beverage trades.

780
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,786
Sales of Slug-o-Cola
have flattened out

781
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:42,664
and Eelwasser
had a very impressive

782
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:43,916
third quarter.

783
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:45,667
Aw, they were lucky.
That's all.

784
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:47,920
I know a way
you can increase sales

785
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,671
of Slug-o-Cola

786
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:52,090
by 50 to 60 percent.

787
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:55,301
I'm all ears.

788
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:58,096
Target the new female consumer.

789
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:01,892
Make Slug-o-Cola<i> her</i> drink.

790
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:03,894
There's nothing stopping her
from drinking it now.

791
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:06,354
But you're
not encouraging her either.

792
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,899
"The slimiest cola
in the galaxy"?

793
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:12,027
That kind
of slogan doesn't
appeal to women.

794
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:14,947
Well, what would?

795
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:17,240
Let me see.

796
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:22,495
Slug-o-Cola contains
43 percent live algae, right?

797
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:25,123
In every bottle.

798
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,751
Well, how about something like

799
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:29,753
"Drink Slug-o-Cola...

800
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:31,797
and keep...

801
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:34,466
your teeth
that lovely shade of green"?

802
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,843
Oh...

803
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:41,014
Zek was right about you.

804
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:43,850
You're very intelligent.

805
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,561
For a female.

806
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:53,652
I think it's time
for dessert now.

807
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:55,153
Good idea.

808
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:59,866
I thought we were going
to have dessert.

809
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,493
Oh, we are...

810
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:03,202
in my quarters.

811
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:05,872
(<i> nervous laughter</i> )

812
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:29,646
Oh, I never ever thought

813
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:34,067
I'd find a clothed
female so... enticing.

814
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:35,234
(<i> excited laughing</i> )

815
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:36,653
(<i> gasps</i> ):
Enticing?

816
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:37,863
Me?

817
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:39,238
Don't be silly.

818
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:44,536
It's so good to
finally be alone...

819
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:45,912
(<i> gasps</i> )

820
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:48,957
without all those
people staring at us.

821
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:51,710
Although, I must admit

822
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:55,714
I-I did find it
somewhat stimulating.

823
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,090
(<i> laughing</i> )

824
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,884
Maybe a little
too stimulating.

825
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:00,844
Oh, can I help it

826
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:04,389
if my lobes burn
for you, huh, huh?

827
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:07,767
If you don't believe me,
just touch them.

828
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:08,768
Touch them.

829
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,520
(<i> excited grunting</i> )

830
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,690
I'll take your
word for it.

831
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:15,859
You said you'd do

832
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:16,943
<i>anything</i> for me.

833
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,945
I lied.

00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:21,239
Oh, oh,<i> oh...</i>

I don't think your

Who cares? She hasn't
touched my lobes in months.

847
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,436
I can tell.

848
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:52,812
Oh, I need you.

849

is a cold shower!

Why, you can

You're making

His name's not Lumba,
it's Quark

870

Do I look like a man?

Nice try, Quark,
but it's not going to work.

He's the station's
bartender.

Don't listen to him,

Oh, come, my dear.

891
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:46,676

everything in my power

893
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,515
to make sure
he remains Grand Nagus.

894
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,808
But...

895
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,101
why?

896
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:58,980
Because that's
what Lumba wants.

897
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:05,237
(<i> door opening</i> )

898
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:07,280
His name's Quark.

899
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,632
Interesting ring.

900
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:30,303
It was a gift.

901
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:34,432
Poor Nilva...
such a lovely man but so lonely.

902
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:37,102
Really?

903
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:40,272
There was a sweetness to him...

904
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:42,815
and also a strength.

905
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:46,319
Sometimes, he'd get
this little glint in his eye...

906
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:49,822
You know what I mean.

907
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:52,491
Not really...

908
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:55,412
but I'm glad you had
a pleasant evening.

909
00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:57,663
You're mocking me, aren't you?

910
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:02,001
And you're being
a little overly sensitive.

911
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:04,879
I've only been a male again
for six hours.

912
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:08,216
My hormones must still be
out of balance.

913
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:10,802
(<i> voice breaking</i> ):
My emotions are raging
out of control.

914
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:14,180
Is there anything I can do?

915
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,265
(<i> crying</i> )

916
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:18,435
Would you mind...

917
00:41:18,435 --> 00:41:20,228
giving me...

918
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:22,063
a hug?

919
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:23,522
A<i> hug?</i>

920
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:25,400
Just a small one.

921
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:29,237
(<i> permissive grunt</i> )

922
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:31,530
Thank you!

923
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,992
(<i> bawling</i> )

924
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,785
(<i> continues bawling</i> )

925
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:43,584
ZEK:
I hope we're not
interrupting anything.

926
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:46,296
Uh, excuse me.

927
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:47,713
We just wanted

928
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:49,048
to say good-bye

929
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,716
before we go back
to Ferenginar.

930
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:52,427
Where the rivers
run with muck

931
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:55,847
and the streets
are swarming with
happy females.

932
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:59,017
And where, if all
goes according to plan

933
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:00,852
the FCA Commissioners

934
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:04,147
will once again
proclaim<i> me</i> Grand Nagus.

935
00:42:04,147 --> 00:42:05,564
That would be nice,
but Brunt's

936
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:07,275
going to fight
you at every turn.

937
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:09,194
Ah, I wouldn't have
it any other way.

938
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:11,737
I'm glad we have
Nilva on our side

939
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:14,824
and we have you to
thank for that, Quark.

940
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:17,452
Will you forgive me, Moogie?

941
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:20,079
Of course I do.

942
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,040
You may be a lousy son,

943
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,917
but you made
a wonderful daughter.

944
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,878
(<i> giggling</i> )

945
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:29,005
I hope the experience
taught you something.

946
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:30,507
It made me more compassionate

947
00:42:30,507 --> 00:42:33,634
more empathetic,
more nurturing.

948
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,928
I feel like I'm trapped
in my worst nightmare.

949
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,180
ZEK:
Don't worry.

950
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,307
I'm sure it
won't last.

951
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:43,436
You'll be back to your
old self in no time.

952
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:49,317
Mmm...

953
00:42:57,534 --> 00:42:58,576
(<i> sighs</i> )

954
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,661
You are<i> so...</i> lucky.

955
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:01,829
Oh.

956
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:05,124
No man ever
gave<i> me</i> a ring.

957
00:43:06,543 --> 00:43:08,420
Quark?

958
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,213
Aluura...

959
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:11,464
I read the book.

960
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:12,965
What book?

961
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:15,218
You know,
Oo-mox<i> for Fun--</i>

962
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:16,677
You shouldn't be
wasting your time

963
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:17,887
reading that
kind of trash.

964
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,680
But you told me to--

965
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,224
Forget what I told you.

966
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:22,892
It was wrong
and I apologize.

967
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:24,727
You are a wonderful employee

968
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:27,021
and I'm lucky
to have you working for me.

969
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:31,609
In fact, as of today,
I'm giving you a raise...

970
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:32,985
another two slips

971
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:34,153
of latinum a week.

972
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:35,280
Really?

973
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,949
It's the least I can do.

974
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,492
(<i> disappointed sigh</i> )

975
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:41,119
That's too bad.

976
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,662
All right, make it three.

977
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:44,997
No, it's not that.

978
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:47,250
Then what?

979
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:49,252
It's just that...

980
00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:51,670
<i>oo-mox</i> sounded like fun--

981
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,756
the tympanic tickle,

982
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:55,592
the Eustachian tube rub,

983
00:43:55,592 --> 00:43:58,719
the...
auditory nerve nibble...

984
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:00,305
(<i> pleading sigh</i> )

985
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:02,432
But if that's the way
you feel about it...

986
00:44:02,432 --> 00:44:05,393
That is<i> exactly</i>
the way I feel about it.

987
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,484
What<i> am</i> I saying?

988
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:15,027
Aluura?

989
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,321
Wait.
