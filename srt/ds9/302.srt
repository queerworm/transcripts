1
00:00:02,698 --> 00:00:06,161
Last time on
<i>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine...</i>

2
00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:07,870
Our mission is to take
the <i>Defiant</i>

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,881
into the Gamma Quadrant
and try to find

4
00:00:09,915 --> 00:00:12,649
the leaders of the
Dominion, the Founders.

5
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:15,092
What the hell is wrong
with Starfleet?!

6
00:00:15,128 --> 00:00:16,529
How could they do this to him?

7
00:00:16,564 --> 00:00:18,432
This has been a long time
coming, Major.

8
00:00:18,469 --> 00:00:20,838
Starfleet has never been
happy with the Constable.

9
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:22,675
I want him to stay
as much as you do

10
00:00:22,713 --> 00:00:24,148
but he has to want to stay.

11
00:00:24,183 --> 00:00:27,350
Ever since we've come
into the Gamma Quadrant...

12
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,460
I've had this feeling...
of being drawn somewhere

13
00:00:32,502 --> 00:00:34,405
to a specific place...

14
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:38,473
the Omarion Nebula.

15
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,123
The last time I saw the <i>Defiant,</i>
she was dead in space

16
00:01:00,169 --> 00:01:03,735
and surrounded
by Jem'Hadar ships.

17
00:01:03,778 --> 00:01:06,181
Sisko? Bashir?

18
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:09,615
I don't know.

19
00:01:23,492 --> 00:01:25,690
Welcome home.

20
00:01:27,601 --> 00:01:29,663
And now the conclusion.

21
00:01:40,098 --> 00:01:43,937
You really are just like me,
aren't you?

22
00:01:43,974 --> 00:01:46,002
Yes.

23
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:56,561
And you're saying,
this is where I'm from?

24
00:01:56,604 --> 00:01:59,041
This is your home.

25
00:01:59,076 --> 00:02:01,138
Ah, I wish I could remember it.

26
00:02:01,181 --> 00:02:04,052
It's understandable
that you cannot.

27
00:02:04,088 --> 00:02:06,423
You were still newly formed
when you left us.

28
00:02:06,461 --> 00:02:07,896
Newly formed?

29
00:02:07,932 --> 00:02:09,401
You mean, I was an infant?

30
00:02:10,705 --> 00:02:12,801
An infant, yes.

31
00:02:12,843 --> 00:02:15,212
Ah. I suspected as much.

32
00:02:15,249 --> 00:02:18,690
Tell me, do I have
any family at all?

33
00:02:18,724 --> 00:02:20,524
Of course.

34
00:02:20,562 --> 00:02:23,467
I'd like to meet them,
if that's possible.

35
00:02:23,502 --> 00:02:25,837
You already have.

36
00:02:25,874 --> 00:02:30,614
We are all part
of the Great Link.

37
00:02:30,653 --> 00:02:33,490
Is that all of us,
or are there others?

38
00:02:33,526 --> 00:02:37,399
Odo, this isn't
a police investigation.

39
00:02:37,435 --> 00:02:39,668
I'm aware of that, Major.

40
00:02:39,707 --> 00:02:42,703
Well, then stop interrogating
these people.

41
00:02:42,749 --> 00:02:47,089
This is the moment you've been
waiting for all your life.

42
00:02:47,126 --> 00:02:48,618
Enjoy it.

43
00:02:50,634 --> 00:02:54,268
He really is happy to be here.

44
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:56,006
Aren't you?

45
00:02:56,047 --> 00:02:58,075
Yes, of course.

46
00:03:02,095 --> 00:03:04,727
It's just that this
is all very sudden.

47
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,102
And you have many questions.

48
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,905
Yes.

49
00:03:08,944 --> 00:03:10,607
Please...

50
00:03:12,286 --> 00:03:17,526
what exactly is this Great Link?

51
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:21,097
The Link is the very foundation
of our society.

52
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,772
It provides a meaning
to our existence.

53
00:03:23,813 --> 00:03:26,581
It is the merging
of form and thought

54
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,114
the sharing of idea
and sensation.

55
00:03:31,164 --> 00:03:32,565
Is something wrong?

56
00:03:37,179 --> 00:03:42,021
I've... lived
a very solitary life.

57
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:45,360
That's unfortunate,
but necessary

58
00:03:45,398 --> 00:03:47,835
as you'll learn in time.

59
00:03:47,871 --> 00:03:51,505
But now, that part
of your life is over.

60
00:03:51,613 --> 00:03:53,242
You're home.

61
00:03:53,284 --> 00:03:56,155
What are you doing?

62
00:03:56,191 --> 00:03:57,660
Take it.

63
00:03:57,694 --> 00:03:59,163
But it's not time.

64
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:00,497
He isn't ready.

65
00:04:00,534 --> 00:04:02,231
He's been gone too long.

66
00:04:02,272 --> 00:04:06,442
He needs to remember,
if only for a moment.

67
00:04:06,482 --> 00:04:08,612
Don't be afraid.

68
00:04:40,263 --> 00:04:42,393
Odo...

69
00:04:42,435 --> 00:04:44,338
What have you done to him?

70
00:04:44,373 --> 00:04:46,902
I allowed him
to experience the Link.

71
00:04:48,717 --> 00:04:50,050
Odo!

72
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:53,755
Yes, Major.

73
00:04:53,796 --> 00:04:55,767
Are you all right?

74
00:04:55,801 --> 00:04:57,395
What happened?

75
00:04:59,943 --> 00:05:01,503
I'm not sure.

76
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,414
But I know one thing.

77
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:08,122
She's right.

78
00:05:09,834 --> 00:05:13,936
I am... home.

79
00:07:17,797 --> 00:07:20,702
Commander's Log, supplemental.

80
00:07:20,737 --> 00:07:24,610
It's been six days since
we had to abandon the <i>Defiant</i>

81
00:07:24,647 --> 00:07:27,586
after the Jem'Hadar attack.

82
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:28,817
We still don't know

83
00:07:28,857 --> 00:07:31,294
what happened
to the rest of the crew.

84
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:35,534
Doctor Bashir and I have plotted
a course back to the wormhole.

85
00:07:35,573 --> 00:07:38,603
Whether the shuttle
can get us back there or not

86
00:07:38,647 --> 00:07:41,313
is questionable at best.

87
00:07:41,354 --> 00:07:43,655
Our engines are failing

88
00:07:43,726 --> 00:07:47,064
our external sensors
are barely functioning

89
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:52,672
and life support systems
are at 20% and dropping.

90
00:07:52,714 --> 00:07:58,354
But other than that,
we couldn't be in better shape.

91
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,058
I thought you were sleeping.

92
00:08:00,098 --> 00:08:02,900
From the sound of things,
I wish I were.

93
00:08:02,938 --> 00:08:04,669
It could be worse.

94
00:08:05,845 --> 00:08:07,041
I believe you.

95
00:08:07,082 --> 00:08:09,280
Do you think it's
some kind of tractor beam?

96
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,619
Could be.

97
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:13,323
I wish these sensors
were working.

98
00:08:16,304 --> 00:08:18,502
Now what?

99
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:24,211
Whoa, hey, don't shoot.

100
00:08:24,256 --> 00:08:25,885
We surrender.

101
00:08:25,927 --> 00:08:26,986
Chief, Dax.

102
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,693
I don't believe it.

103
00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:30,931
We thought you'd been
captured by the Jem'Hadar.

104
00:08:30,972 --> 00:08:31,940
Well, we had our doubts

105
00:08:31,975 --> 00:08:33,444
about ever seeing you again,
either, Julian.

106
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:34,709
We've been searching
for you for days.

107
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:35,910
What about the others?

108
00:08:35,951 --> 00:08:37,386
No sign of them yet

109
00:08:37,421 --> 00:08:39,950
but we still have ships
out looking for them.

110
00:08:39,994 --> 00:08:42,056
Meanwhile, our orders are

111
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:44,127
to get you back to DS9
as soon as possible.

112
00:08:44,171 --> 00:08:47,110
There are big things
happening there, Benjamin.

113
00:08:47,145 --> 00:08:49,207
I think you're in
for a surprise.

114
00:08:55,999 --> 00:08:57,993
This is beautiful.

115
00:08:59,107 --> 00:09:02,673
How long do they plan
on making us wait here?

116
00:09:02,715 --> 00:09:04,378
We've only been here
a few hours.

117
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,483
Ha! I finally return home

118
00:09:07,526 --> 00:09:09,724
and they still treat me
like an outsider.

119
00:09:09,832 --> 00:09:12,600
Oh, believe me, you're not
the outsider here, I am.

120
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:14,108
You?

121
00:09:14,143 --> 00:09:16,478
I'm the one they
don't trust, not you.

122
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:18,144
How perceptive, Major.

123
00:09:18,185 --> 00:09:21,090
If our history
has taught us anything

124
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:24,896
it's to avoid contact
with solids whenever possible.

125
00:09:24,935 --> 00:09:25,925
Solids?

126
00:09:25,971 --> 00:09:28,944
Our name for mono-forms
like yourself

127
00:09:28,978 --> 00:09:31,883
who will never know
the joys of the Great Link.

128
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,445
I don't intend to stay long.

129
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:36,519
There's a chance Sisko and
the others survived the attack.

130
00:09:36,563 --> 00:09:38,397
I'm going to go back
to the shuttle

131
00:09:38,434 --> 00:09:39,528
and try contacting them.

132
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,903
I'm sorry, I cannot allow you

133
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,572
to send any communications
from the planet's surface.

134
00:09:43,613 --> 00:09:47,281
They could be traced back here.

135
00:09:47,322 --> 00:09:48,951
We value our isolation.

136
00:09:48,992 --> 00:09:51,088
Yes, of course.

137
00:09:56,544 --> 00:10:00,315
Tell me, Odo, have you made
good use of the arboretum?

138
00:10:03,861 --> 00:10:06,128
In what way?

139
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:10,576
By assuming the various shapes
surrounding you.

140
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:13,778
Why would I do that?

141
00:10:13,819 --> 00:10:16,849
To become a thing
is to know a thing.

142
00:10:16,892 --> 00:10:21,836
To assume its form is to begin
to understand its existence.

143
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,776
Understand it?
How?

144
00:10:24,812 --> 00:10:26,111
Living among the solids

145
00:10:26,148 --> 00:10:28,585
has damaged you far worse
than I realized.

146
00:10:28,621 --> 00:10:31,685
It has left you ignorant
of the gifts you possess.

147
00:10:36,239 --> 00:10:38,837
Then teach me
what I need to know.

148
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:40,941
I'll do what I can.

149
00:10:46,664 --> 00:10:50,230
But in the end,
this is another journey

150
00:10:50,273 --> 00:10:53,405
you'll have to make on your own.

151
00:10:55,653 --> 00:10:57,556
And when it is over

152
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:01,156
you'll be ready to take
your place in the Great Link.

153
00:11:17,638 --> 00:11:19,130
Odo.

154
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:24,988
I'd like to be alone,
if you don't mind.

155
00:11:25,056 --> 00:11:28,428
All right.

156
00:11:28,465 --> 00:11:29,661
But if you need me

157
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,502
I'll be in the shuttle
trying to contact Sisko.

158
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:33,805
Don't worry.

159
00:11:33,844 --> 00:11:36,646
When I was in the resistance,
I learned to camouflage

160
00:11:36,684 --> 00:11:39,019
subspace messages
using quantum interference.

161
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:41,151
I taught the method
to Commander Sisko.

162
00:11:41,194 --> 00:11:43,928
If anyone intercepts the signal,
all they'll read

163
00:11:43,968 --> 00:11:46,337
is elevated levels
of background radiation.

164
00:11:46,374 --> 00:11:49,541
Good luck.

165
00:11:49,582 --> 00:11:50,949
You, too.

166
00:12:01,109 --> 00:12:03,580
Well, Commander,
it appears your mission

167
00:12:03,616 --> 00:12:05,644
was an even greater
success than we hoped.

168
00:12:05,687 --> 00:12:07,452
So I'm told.

169
00:12:07,491 --> 00:12:09,394
Has the delegation
from the Founders

170
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:10,762
arrived on the station yet?

171
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:12,793
They're already meeting
with representatives

172
00:12:12,838 --> 00:12:14,034
from the Federation Council

173
00:12:14,073 --> 00:12:16,739
and a dozen other
Alpha Quadrant alliances.

174
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,511
We're hoping to have
a treaty signed

175
00:12:18,551 --> 00:12:22,151
within a matter of days,
and we have you to thank for it.

176
00:12:22,193 --> 00:12:24,927
Actually, it's Lieutenant Dax
and Chief O'Brien

177
00:12:24,966 --> 00:12:26,663
who deserve most of the credit.

178
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:27,900
Well, we were lucky
the Jem'Hadar

179
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,068
handed us over to the Founders.

180
00:12:29,176 --> 00:12:31,613
We just had to convince them
we were serious about peace.

181
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:33,677
Actually, it didn't take
that much convincing.

182
00:12:33,721 --> 00:12:37,823
I suppose the only question is,
can we trust them?

183
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,366
It's a risk, I know

184
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:46,851
but both the Federation Council
and Starfleet Command

185
00:12:46,885 --> 00:12:48,788
believe it's one worth taking.

186
00:12:48,824 --> 00:12:51,888
By the way, Commander, one of
the Founders asked to see you

187
00:12:51,931 --> 00:12:54,368
the moment you arrive
on the station.

188
00:12:54,404 --> 00:12:56,101
Asked to see me?

189
00:12:56,141 --> 00:12:58,135
If you're not too busy.

190
00:12:58,179 --> 00:13:01,711
Well, I suppose I could
spare a few minutes.

191
00:13:08,638 --> 00:13:11,236
Commander Sisko, come in.

192
00:13:11,277 --> 00:13:15,013
I've looked forward
to meeting you.

193
00:13:15,053 --> 00:13:16,887
I am Borath.

194
00:13:16,924 --> 00:13:19,863
And you're one of the Founders?

195
00:13:19,898 --> 00:13:21,231
That's correct.

196
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:22,999
You seem surprised.

197
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:26,137
Not really, only...

198
00:13:26,246 --> 00:13:29,652
I hadn't realized till now

199
00:13:29,688 --> 00:13:31,488
I've already met
one of your people.

200
00:13:31,526 --> 00:13:34,090
You're referring
to Eris, of course.

201
00:13:34,132 --> 00:13:37,162
Yes, she is one of us.

202
00:13:37,206 --> 00:13:39,302
Though she couldn't
very well admit it

203
00:13:39,344 --> 00:13:41,577
while you were pointing
a phaser at her.

204
00:13:41,617 --> 00:13:45,183
I am glad to see
you're not holding one now.

205
00:13:45,226 --> 00:13:46,422
Do I need one?

206
00:13:46,461 --> 00:13:47,760
Oh, not at all.

207
00:13:47,798 --> 00:13:49,529
You seem skeptical.

208
00:13:49,569 --> 00:13:51,095
Can you blame me?

209
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:54,010
No, I realize

210
00:13:54,046 --> 00:13:55,983
you have no reason
to trust the Dominion

211
00:13:56,018 --> 00:13:58,046
but you must understand

212
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,493
that we were only trying
to defend ourselves.

213
00:14:00,528 --> 00:14:01,690
From what?

214
00:14:01,732 --> 00:14:02,894
We felt threatened

215
00:14:02,934 --> 00:14:06,431
by your incursions
into the Gamma Quadrant.

216
00:14:06,476 --> 00:14:07,992
And now?

217
00:14:08,126 --> 00:14:10,563
Commander, you risked your life

218
00:14:10,598 --> 00:14:14,471
to bring us a message
of peace and friendship.

219
00:14:14,508 --> 00:14:17,106
We chose to accept your offer.

220
00:14:19,554 --> 00:14:22,721
Would you have
rather we refused?

221
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:24,492
No.

222
00:14:24,532 --> 00:14:27,471
Good. Because
believe me, Commander

223
00:14:27,506 --> 00:14:32,610
an alliance between the Dominion
and the Federation

224
00:14:32,651 --> 00:14:35,921
will be beneficial
to both our people.

225
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,291
Doctor, welcome back.

226
00:14:50,327 --> 00:14:51,421
Why, thank you, Garak.

227
00:14:51,463 --> 00:14:52,522
It's good to be back.

228
00:14:52,566 --> 00:14:53,534
Yes.

229
00:14:53,568 --> 00:14:54,593
Business keeping you busy?

230
00:14:54,638 --> 00:14:58,443
Oh, the tailoring business
or the spy business?

231
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,314
I'm joking, of course.

232
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,786
Of course.

233
00:15:01,821 --> 00:15:03,290
I've missed you.

234
00:15:03,325 --> 00:15:05,854
I've been genuinely
concerned for your safety.

235
00:15:05,897 --> 00:15:07,891
Lunch hasn't been
the same without you.

236
00:15:08,002 --> 00:15:10,132
That's very kind of you
to say so, Garak.

237
00:15:10,174 --> 00:15:12,475
Hopefully, things'll
start getting back

238
00:15:12,514 --> 00:15:13,847
to normal around here.

239
00:15:13,884 --> 00:15:15,787
Oh, I doubt that's going
to happen, Doctor.

240
00:15:15,821 --> 00:15:16,846
I doubt that very much.

241
00:15:16,891 --> 00:15:17,859
And why is that?

242
00:15:17,893 --> 00:15:20,296
There's an old saying
on Cardassia:

243
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,893
"Enemies make
dangerous friends."

244
00:15:21,936 --> 00:15:23,132
And I fear the Dominion

245
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:24,938
will make a very dangerous
friend indeed.

246
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,710
I take it you're referring
to the peace talks.

247
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,051
Exactly. I'm afraid
these treaty negotiations

248
00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:32,560
are a mistake we're going
to live to regret.

249
00:15:32,595 --> 00:15:35,363
Is that your opinion
or the opinion

250
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:36,962
of the Cardassian
Central Command?

251
00:15:37,072 --> 00:15:38,666
The former, I assure you.

252
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:41,841
The Central Command is very
much in favor of this treaty

253
00:15:41,884 --> 00:15:45,791
which, as far as I'm concerned,
only justifies my fears.

254
00:15:45,826 --> 00:15:47,455
Well, I, for one

255
00:15:47,498 --> 00:15:50,300
hope you're worrying
about nothing.

256
00:15:50,338 --> 00:15:52,673
Subcommander T'Rul.

257
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:53,678
You all right?

258
00:15:53,712 --> 00:15:54,737
I'm fine.

259
00:15:54,782 --> 00:15:57,253
I had a minor disagreement
with some Starfleet

260
00:15:57,287 --> 00:15:58,346
security officers.

261
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,121
They refused
to allow me to speak

262
00:16:00,161 --> 00:16:02,291
with the Federation's
negotiating team.

263
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,133
Well, what did you want
to talk to them about?

264
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,936
I wanted to protest
the exclusion

265
00:16:05,974 --> 00:16:08,811
of the Romulan Empire
from the treaty negotiations.

266
00:16:08,848 --> 00:16:11,149
I wasn't aware the Romulans
had been excluded.

267
00:16:11,188 --> 00:16:13,854
Every great power in the Alpha
Quadrant has been invited

268
00:16:13,894 --> 00:16:16,229
to participate except for us.

269
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,601
Then there must be some mistake.

270
00:16:18,638 --> 00:16:21,338
The mistake is thinking
the Romulan Empire will stand by

271
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:24,352
and allow such a betrayal
to go unchallenged.

272
00:16:24,386 --> 00:16:28,886
Believe me, Doctor, if a treaty
is signed without our approval

273
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:31,197
it will mean war.

274
00:16:33,441 --> 00:16:38,853
Still feel that I'm worrying
about nothing, Doctor?

275
00:16:40,391 --> 00:16:42,726
Computer, transmit
a subspace signal

276
00:16:42,763 --> 00:16:45,064
using a narrow
theta band frequency

277
00:16:45,102 --> 00:16:47,232
shifted into
a background radiation domain.

278
00:16:47,274 --> 00:16:48,903
Working.

279
00:16:48,945 --> 00:16:51,816
I hope you're out there,
Commander.

280
00:16:51,852 --> 00:16:53,583
Unable to transmit signal

281
00:16:53,622 --> 00:16:56,994
due to external interference
at all frequencies.

282
00:16:57,031 --> 00:17:00,267
Identify source of interference.

283
00:17:00,305 --> 00:17:03,369
Interference generated
by thermal radiation

284
00:17:03,413 --> 00:17:05,714
from a subterranean
power source.

285
00:17:05,751 --> 00:17:07,915
Locate power source.

286
00:17:07,957 --> 00:17:10,053
Power source is located

287
00:17:10,128 --> 00:17:12,497
four kilometers
beneath the planet's surface.

288
00:17:12,535 --> 00:17:15,702
Coordinates 127 mark 3.

289
00:17:15,742 --> 00:17:17,439
Can you identify?

290
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:23,859
Unable to identify due to an
unknown poly-metallic substance

291
00:17:23,895 --> 00:17:25,091
within the surrounding rock.

292
00:17:25,198 --> 00:17:26,667
Any luck, Major?

293
00:17:26,701 --> 00:17:30,666
No, some kind of power source
is interfering with my signal.

294
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:32,545
Do you have any idea
what it could be?

295
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:33,847
I haven't a clue.

296
00:17:35,857 --> 00:17:37,087
Are you all right?

297
00:17:39,132 --> 00:17:42,664
I have spent the last two hours
shape-shifting...

298
00:17:42,707 --> 00:17:45,373
rocks, flowers, trees...

299
00:17:45,413 --> 00:17:48,717
I have been everything
in that... garden.

300
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:51,784
And?

301
00:17:51,828 --> 00:17:53,388
And nothing.

302
00:17:53,433 --> 00:17:55,768
Oh, I can become
a rock all right

303
00:17:55,805 --> 00:17:59,678
but I have no more of an idea
what it is to be a rock

304
00:17:59,714 --> 00:18:01,411
than I did before.

305
00:18:02,755 --> 00:18:05,226
I'm not really sure
what that means.

306
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:08,028
I'm not sure either

307
00:18:08,067 --> 00:18:11,769
and that's... unfortunate.

308
00:18:14,951 --> 00:18:20,363
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to return to my bucket.

309
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,614
Commander, Admiral Nechayev
is here to see you.

310
00:18:30,655 --> 00:18:33,219
Send her in.

311
00:18:34,899 --> 00:18:36,870
You asked to see me, Commander?

312
00:18:36,903 --> 00:18:38,304
I understand that the Romulans

313
00:18:38,339 --> 00:18:40,207
haven't been invited
to the peace talks.

314
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,975
That's correct.

315
00:18:42,016 --> 00:18:43,713
I was wondering
what prompted that decision.

316
00:18:43,753 --> 00:18:46,487
The Founders requested
that they be excluded.

317
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:47,790
Did they say why?

318
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,129
They felt the Romulans

319
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,069
would be
a disruptive influence.

320
00:18:51,104 --> 00:18:54,043
More disruptive
than the Cardassians?

321
00:18:54,077 --> 00:18:55,808
They seemed to think so.

322
00:18:55,849 --> 00:18:58,583
Do you have a problem
with this, Commander?

323
00:18:58,622 --> 00:19:01,322
Whether I have a problem with it
isn't the point.

324
00:19:01,362 --> 00:19:03,663
It's the Romulans
we have to worry about.

325
00:19:03,701 --> 00:19:05,797
Commander, if this treaty
is signed

326
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:07,604
and I'm confident it will be

327
00:19:07,643 --> 00:19:10,810
we'll never have to worry
about the Romulans again.

328
00:19:10,851 --> 00:19:11,910
Are you sure of that?

329
00:19:11,953 --> 00:19:13,081
Quite sure.

330
00:19:13,123 --> 00:19:14,888
After all, what chance
would they have

331
00:19:14,928 --> 00:19:17,799
against the combined power
of our new alliance?

332
00:19:17,835 --> 00:19:20,204
They wouldn't have
much of a chance at all.

333
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,234
I'm glad we agree.

334
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:23,942
Believe me, Commander

335
00:19:23,982 --> 00:19:26,215
the Federation carefully
weighed all the options

336
00:19:26,254 --> 00:19:28,452
before entering
into these peace talks.

337
00:19:30,298 --> 00:19:31,995
I realize that.

338
00:19:32,036 --> 00:19:35,670
Then we have nothing
further to discuss, do we?

339
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,803
Why do you dislike
humanoids so much?

340
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,777
I know they have their flaws

341
00:19:49,811 --> 00:19:53,810
but I've found many of them
to be kind, decent people.

342
00:19:53,854 --> 00:19:56,452
Like Major Kira?

343
00:19:56,494 --> 00:19:58,465
Yes, like Major Kira.

344
00:19:58,499 --> 00:20:01,769
Then you've been more fortunate
than most changelings.

345
00:20:01,806 --> 00:20:02,968
"Changelings?"

346
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,208
You recognize the term?

347
00:20:05,248 --> 00:20:09,816
Hmm. I've been called
a "changeling" on occasion.

348
00:20:09,859 --> 00:20:12,798
It's a name given
to us by the solids.

349
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,031
They meant it as an insult

350
00:20:15,072 --> 00:20:18,638
but, in defiance,
we took it and made it our own.

351
00:20:18,681 --> 00:20:21,415
Go on, please.

352
00:20:24,728 --> 00:20:27,758
The Great Link tells us
that many years ago

353
00:20:27,803 --> 00:20:31,802
our people roamed the stars,
searching out other races

354
00:20:31,845 --> 00:20:35,342
so we could add
to our knowledge of the galaxy.

355
00:20:35,387 --> 00:20:38,417
We went in peace,
but too often we were met

356
00:20:38,494 --> 00:20:41,160
with suspicion,
hatred and violence.

357
00:20:41,201 --> 00:20:42,670
Why?

358
00:20:42,704 --> 00:20:47,044
The solids feared
our metamorphic abilities.

359
00:20:47,081 --> 00:20:50,715
So we were beaten,
hunted and killed.

360
00:20:50,758 --> 00:20:52,922
Finally, we arrived here.

361
00:20:52,963 --> 00:20:57,565
And here, safe in our isolation,
we made our home.

362
00:20:57,607 --> 00:21:01,728
Tell me... why was I sent away?

363
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:03,626
Because even in our isolation

364
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:06,434
we desired to learn
more about the galaxy.

365
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,808
You were one of 100 infants
sent off

366
00:21:08,845 --> 00:21:10,782
to gain that knowledge for us.

367
00:21:10,817 --> 00:21:12,947
But how could you be sure

368
00:21:12,988 --> 00:21:15,118
that we'd find
our way back here?

369
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,789
You had no choice.

370
00:21:16,831 --> 00:21:18,460
The urge to return home

371
00:21:18,501 --> 00:21:20,699
was implanted
in your genetic makeup.

372
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,574
And now, thanks
to the passageway

373
00:21:22,611 --> 00:21:24,980
you're the first one
to return to us.

374
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:27,113
We weren't expecting you
so soon.

375
00:21:27,155 --> 00:21:28,784
When were you expecting me?

376
00:21:28,826 --> 00:21:31,458
Not for another 300 years.

377
00:21:41,957 --> 00:21:44,053
How long was I away?

378
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:46,660
A long time.

379
00:21:46,702 --> 00:21:50,940
But now, all that matters
is that you're here.

380
00:21:54,053 --> 00:21:55,647
It's...

381
00:21:57,495 --> 00:22:01,163
different than I
imagined it would be.

382
00:22:01,203 --> 00:22:07,116
Whatever you imagined,
I promise it will be better.

383
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:51,016
Odo, are you here?

384
00:22:54,465 --> 00:22:56,595
Odo...

385
00:22:56,637 --> 00:23:01,445
I'm going to try to track
the source of the interference.

386
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:04,613
If I can't find it
and neutralize it

387
00:23:04,656 --> 00:23:07,254
I'm going to have to leave here

388
00:23:07,295 --> 00:23:09,995
and try to find
Sisko and the others.

389
00:23:15,682 --> 00:23:19,647
I'm really glad
you made it home, Odo.

390
00:23:19,692 --> 00:23:23,862
I know everything is going
to work out just fine.

391
00:23:26,374 --> 00:23:28,003
I don't believe it.

392
00:23:28,045 --> 00:23:29,708
I'm talking to a tree.

393
00:23:31,721 --> 00:23:34,717
You're probably not
even here, are you?

394
00:23:50,766 --> 00:23:53,864
Why would shape-shifters
need a door?

395
00:23:56,213 --> 00:23:58,343
Kira to computer.

396
00:23:58,384 --> 00:24:02,349
Scan the area dead ahead of me
for 100 meters.

397
00:24:02,394 --> 00:24:06,062
Unable to penetrate
due to interference.

398
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,728
Excuse me.

399
00:24:20,771 --> 00:24:22,400
Pardon me.

400
00:24:22,442 --> 00:24:25,074
After you.

401
00:24:25,115 --> 00:24:27,747
Look out.
Coming through.

402
00:24:27,788 --> 00:24:30,522
Sorry to keep you
waiting, gentlemen.

403
00:24:30,561 --> 00:24:33,398
That's two synthales,
on the house.

404
00:24:33,435 --> 00:24:35,929
What's put you
in such a good humor?

405
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,671
I have inside information

406
00:24:37,712 --> 00:24:40,617
that the peace agreement
is about to be finalized.

407
00:24:40,652 --> 00:24:42,452
And where did you get
this information?

408
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,893
From one of your friends
on the Federation Council?

409
00:24:44,929 --> 00:24:47,230
If you must know, I overheard
two Jem'Hadar officers.

410
00:24:47,268 --> 00:24:50,139
And you believed them?

411
00:24:50,175 --> 00:24:51,975
I don't see why not.

412
00:24:52,013 --> 00:24:54,211
Oh, I know we got off
to a rocky start

413
00:24:54,251 --> 00:24:56,085
but they're not so bad.

414
00:24:56,123 --> 00:24:57,422
Really.

415
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,397
I think they have the gene.

416
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,729
What gene?

417
00:25:00,767 --> 00:25:01,895
The gambling gene.

418
00:25:01,937 --> 00:25:03,874
They've barely been
on this station a week

419
00:25:03,908 --> 00:25:06,277
and already they can hardly
drag themselves away

420
00:25:06,314 --> 00:25:07,783
from the dabo table.

421
00:25:07,817 --> 00:25:10,118
How fortunate for you.

422
00:25:10,156 --> 00:25:13,357
How fortunate for all of us.

423
00:25:13,398 --> 00:25:16,371
You see, I have a dream...

424
00:25:16,405 --> 00:25:19,709
a dream that one day
all people...

425
00:25:19,746 --> 00:25:25,659
human, Jem'Hadar, Ferengi,
Cardassians...

426
00:25:25,693 --> 00:25:28,495
will stand together in peace...

427
00:25:28,534 --> 00:25:30,801
around my dabo tables.

428
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:33,072
You're a regular visionary,
Quark.

429
00:25:33,111 --> 00:25:35,344
I am, aren't I?

430
00:25:38,056 --> 00:25:40,186
You're in my way!

431
00:25:40,228 --> 00:25:41,891
Sorry.

432
00:25:44,104 --> 00:25:45,037
Now, look!

433
00:25:55,866 --> 00:25:59,363
Gentlemen, please,
remember my vision.

434
00:25:59,407 --> 00:26:00,876
That's enough.

435
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:04,679
All right.
What's going on here?

436
00:26:04,721 --> 00:26:07,192
He addressed me
in a disrespectful tone.

437
00:26:07,226 --> 00:26:08,525
That's a lie.

438
00:26:08,563 --> 00:26:10,932
Easy, Doctor.
We're all friends here.

439
00:26:10,968 --> 00:26:12,437
Tell him that.

440
00:26:12,472 --> 00:26:15,036
I'll see this
doesn't happen again.

441
00:26:15,078 --> 00:26:16,981
I expect you will.

442
00:26:20,257 --> 00:26:21,556
Is that it?

443
00:26:21,594 --> 00:26:24,065
You're just going
to let him walk away?

444
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,666
Our orders are to give
the Jem'Hadar a wide berth.

445
00:26:27,709 --> 00:26:28,871
Look, I know
what the orders say

446
00:26:28,911 --> 00:26:30,005
but he attacked Chief O'Brien

447
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:31,951
and we have rules here
against that sort of thing.

448
00:26:31,986 --> 00:26:34,686
I'm aware of station
regulations, Doctor.

449
00:26:34,725 --> 00:26:36,593
However,
the Jem'Hadar are not.

450
00:26:36,697 --> 00:26:37,893
We have to allow them

451
00:26:37,933 --> 00:26:40,029
some time to get used
to our customs.

452
00:26:40,072 --> 00:26:41,541
So, in the meantime

453
00:26:41,575 --> 00:26:44,173
they're free to do
whatever they want.

454
00:26:44,215 --> 00:26:45,514
Remember that

455
00:26:45,552 --> 00:26:48,650
before you get into
another brawl with them.

456
00:26:53,003 --> 00:26:56,535
Dad, pass me the potatoes.

457
00:26:56,578 --> 00:26:58,207
Dad?

458
00:26:58,248 --> 00:26:59,911
Yes, Jake.

459
00:26:59,953 --> 00:27:01,947
The potatoes.

460
00:27:03,628 --> 00:27:05,097
Oh.

461
00:27:05,132 --> 00:27:06,431
Dad, is something wrong?

462
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:08,939
Not really.

463
00:27:08,974 --> 00:27:13,314
I'm just a little preoccupied,
that's all.

464
00:27:15,991 --> 00:27:18,360
It's these Dominion
negotiations.

465
00:27:18,397 --> 00:27:19,627
What about them?

466
00:27:19,666 --> 00:27:22,867
Well, it's all happening
behind closed doors.

467
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:27,317
I... I guess I just feel...

468
00:27:27,351 --> 00:27:30,347
out of the loop.

469
00:27:30,392 --> 00:27:32,795
There's something going on,
isn't there?

470
00:27:32,832 --> 00:27:34,826
Like what?

471
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:37,068
You tell me.

472
00:27:40,884 --> 00:27:42,353
Come in.

473
00:27:42,387 --> 00:27:44,620
Benjamin.

474
00:27:44,659 --> 00:27:47,153
Did you know about this?

475
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:48,566
Know about what?

476
00:27:48,603 --> 00:27:50,437
I being transferred
to the <i>Lexington.</i>

477
00:27:50,473 --> 00:27:51,999
I'm their new Science Officer.

478
00:27:52,044 --> 00:27:53,274
There must be some mistake.

479
00:27:53,313 --> 00:27:54,714
The orders are right here.

480
00:27:54,817 --> 00:27:56,377
Let me see this.

481
00:27:58,827 --> 00:28:00,296
I don't believe it.

482
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:01,765
Bashir to Sisko.

483
00:28:01,801 --> 00:28:03,065
Go ahead, Doctor.

484
00:28:03,104 --> 00:28:06,168
Commander, I need to talk
to you about the Jem'Hadar.

485
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,848
I want to know
what the hell is going on!

486
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:14,489
Commander, I don't appreciate
your barging in here.

487
00:28:14,531 --> 00:28:16,262
I want to know
why my Science Officer's

488
00:28:16,303 --> 00:28:17,932
been transferred
without my consent.

489
00:28:17,973 --> 00:28:19,841
I want to know
why my Chief of Operations

490
00:28:19,878 --> 00:28:21,074
is lying in the Infirmary

491
00:28:21,113 --> 00:28:23,881
while the Jem'Hadar who beat him
is free to walk the station.

492
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,084
And I want to know
why the Federation is willing

493
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:28,460
to risk a war with the Romulans
to form an alliance

494
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:30,740
with a group of people that we
hardly know and barely trust!

495
00:28:30,873 --> 00:28:31,967
Are you finished?

496
00:28:32,009 --> 00:28:34,003
I haven't even begun!

497
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:36,041
Admiral, I think you

498
00:28:36,085 --> 00:28:40,357
should tell Commander Sisko
what he wants to know.

499
00:28:40,396 --> 00:28:42,629
All right, I suppose
he deserves

500
00:28:42,668 --> 00:28:45,003
to be the first
to hear the news.

501
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:46,374
What news?

502
00:28:46,411 --> 00:28:48,848
The Federation is pulling
out of this sector.

503
00:28:48,883 --> 00:28:50,717
All Starfleet
personnel currently

504
00:28:50,754 --> 00:28:52,952
stationed on DS9
will be reassigned

505
00:28:52,993 --> 00:28:54,292
to other posts.

506
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:55,298
Yourself included.

507
00:28:55,332 --> 00:28:56,494
What about Bajor?

508
00:28:56,535 --> 00:28:59,907
Our plans for Bajor
are on hold for the time being.

509
00:28:59,943 --> 00:29:02,575
From now on, Bajor will be
the Dominion's responsibility.

510
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:04,780
They'll be running this station.

511
00:29:04,821 --> 00:29:08,262
And you're telling me that the
Bajorans have agreed to this?

512
00:29:08,296 --> 00:29:09,788
We're confident
they'll have no objections.

513
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:12,066
And if they do object,
what then?

514
00:29:12,106 --> 00:29:13,906
You send in the Jem'Hadar?

515
00:29:13,943 --> 00:29:17,611
The Jem'Hadar are used
only against our enemies.

516
00:29:17,652 --> 00:29:20,922
Bajor will be protected,
Commander.

517
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,486
We'll see to it.

518
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:24,090
What about the wormhole?

519
00:29:24,134 --> 00:29:25,934
Will they get
to protect that, too?

520
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:28,034
It's the price of peace,
Benjamin.

521
00:29:28,077 --> 00:29:31,381
Well, if you ask me,
the price is too damned high.

522
00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:35,326
What is the Federation supposed
to get out of all of this?

523
00:29:35,361 --> 00:29:37,229
Our friendship.

524
00:29:37,266 --> 00:29:39,567
Isn't that enough?

525
00:29:39,604 --> 00:29:42,007
And you, Benjamin,
get a promotion...

526
00:29:42,043 --> 00:29:44,241
Captain Sisko.

527
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:45,445
It's an important step

528
00:29:45,552 --> 00:29:47,955
toward that Admiralcy
you've always wanted.

529
00:29:47,992 --> 00:29:51,159
I want a chance to speak to
the Federation negotiating team

530
00:29:51,199 --> 00:29:52,759
before this treaty is signed!

531
00:29:52,802 --> 00:29:54,465
It's too late for that, Ben.

532
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:57,206
The treaty was signed
late this afternoon.

533
00:30:01,691 --> 00:30:04,391
It's the beginning
of a new era, Commander

534
00:30:04,431 --> 00:30:06,493
and you helped make it possible.

535
00:30:06,536 --> 00:30:08,028
Congratulations.

536
00:30:25,514 --> 00:30:27,006
Odo.

537
00:30:27,051 --> 00:30:29,717
I've been waiting for you.

538
00:30:29,758 --> 00:30:30,726
Major!

539
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,793
I have just had the most
remarkable experience.

540
00:30:34,837 --> 00:30:38,573
For a few moments,
I actually felt what it was like

541
00:30:38,612 --> 00:30:41,585
to be an Arbazon vulture.

542
00:30:41,687 --> 00:30:45,594
The air currents
beneath my wings

543
00:30:45,662 --> 00:30:49,968
the exhilaration of soaring
above the treetops.

544
00:30:50,006 --> 00:30:54,506
Oh, it was all...
very stimulating.

545
00:30:54,551 --> 00:30:56,488
I'm so happy for you.

546
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:58,185
I know you are.

547
00:30:58,226 --> 00:31:03,000
So, I guess this means
you'll be staying here a while.

548
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,380
I've enjoyed working
with you, Major.

549
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:14,262
I've enjoyed working
with you, too, Odo.

550
00:31:14,298 --> 00:31:21,271
But, before we say good-bye,
I need your help one last time.

551
00:31:21,315 --> 00:31:22,340
Certainly.

552
00:31:22,384 --> 00:31:24,787
Remember that power source
I was telling you about?

553
00:31:24,823 --> 00:31:26,156
The one preventing you

554
00:31:26,193 --> 00:31:28,187
from trying to contact
Commander Sisko.

555
00:31:28,232 --> 00:31:29,360
Well, I found it.

556
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,630
And what did it turn out to be?

557
00:31:30,704 --> 00:31:31,763
I couldn't tell.

558
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,903
There was a door
blocking my path.

559
00:31:33,945 --> 00:31:35,380
I need you to help me open it.

560
00:31:35,415 --> 00:31:37,477
What kind of door?

561
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,046
It was composed
of some kind metal

562
00:31:39,091 --> 00:31:40,822
that the tricorder
couldn't identify.

563
00:31:40,861 --> 00:31:42,855
Other than that, it,
it's an ordinary door.

564
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:43,993
That's odd.

565
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:46,166
My people have
no need for doors.

566
00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:48,441
They dislike taking
humanoid form.

567
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,972
I know.

568
00:31:50,017 --> 00:31:52,386
Then who could be using it?

569
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,597
Ah, Commander.

570
00:31:58,637 --> 00:32:01,873
I was hoping to see
you before you left.

571
00:32:01,912 --> 00:32:05,877
I just wanted to tell you
how impressed I've been with you

572
00:32:05,922 --> 00:32:07,756
during these past two years.

573
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:08,989
You've run this station

574
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:12,435
with strength, dignity
and compassion.

575
00:32:12,471 --> 00:32:13,940
Well done.

576
00:32:17,048 --> 00:32:18,916
Thank you, Mr. Garak.

577
00:32:18,953 --> 00:32:22,189
But I'm sure you'll
be back before long.

578
00:32:22,227 --> 00:32:27,171
Though from what I've heard,
it'll be to fight against Bajor.

579
00:32:27,206 --> 00:32:29,404
I've heard the same rumors.

580
00:32:29,444 --> 00:32:32,315
That Bajor has forged
a pact with the Romulans

581
00:32:32,351 --> 00:32:35,051
to stand against
the Jem'Hadar...

582
00:32:35,091 --> 00:32:36,994
and their allies.

583
00:32:37,029 --> 00:32:39,729
Oh, the Bajorans have fought
for their freedom before.

584
00:32:39,836 --> 00:32:43,972
It only makes sense that
they'd fight for it again.

585
00:32:44,013 --> 00:32:45,642
So much for my peace mission.

586
00:32:45,683 --> 00:32:48,485
Do I detect a note
of bitterness in your voice?

587
00:32:48,524 --> 00:32:50,461
I wouldn't be surprised.

588
00:32:50,495 --> 00:32:53,297
If it means anything to you,
Commander

589
00:32:53,335 --> 00:32:57,778
I happen to share your feelings
about this Dominion treaty.

590
00:32:57,813 --> 00:33:00,307
I've thought about it
a great deal

591
00:33:00,352 --> 00:33:02,950
and the only explanation
I can find

592
00:33:02,991 --> 00:33:06,329
is that our leaders
have simply gone insane.

593
00:33:07,837 --> 00:33:09,329
It seems that way.

594
00:33:09,373 --> 00:33:13,873
Unfortunately, there's nothing
you or I can do about it.

595
00:33:13,918 --> 00:33:15,046
I suppose not.

596
00:33:15,087 --> 00:33:16,579
After all, you have

597
00:33:16,624 --> 00:33:19,095
your orders, and as for me,
well...

598
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:21,363
I wouldn't dream

599
00:33:21,402 --> 00:33:25,036
of opposing the wishes
of the Central Command.

600
00:33:25,078 --> 00:33:27,345
Pity.

601
00:33:27,383 --> 00:33:29,377
I agree...

602
00:33:30,892 --> 00:33:32,988
that it's a pity.

603
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:36,368
I thought you would.

604
00:33:38,243 --> 00:33:42,379
Mr. Garak, I never knew
we thought so much alike.

605
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:47,090
Life is full of surprises,
Commander.

606
00:33:47,131 --> 00:33:48,361
Hmm.

607
00:33:49,303 --> 00:33:51,331
Commander Sisko!

608
00:33:51,374 --> 00:33:53,938
Ah! There she is!

609
00:33:53,981 --> 00:33:55,507
No!

610
00:34:05,007 --> 00:34:06,374
Can I help you?

611
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:08,540
We're here to see
Commander Sisko.

612
00:34:08,582 --> 00:34:10,553
Sorry, my orders are
no one sees him.

613
00:34:10,587 --> 00:34:12,147
But we're here
on urgent business.

614
00:34:12,191 --> 00:34:13,956
Well, you'll have to talk
to Admiral Nechayev.

615
00:34:13,996 --> 00:34:15,659
She's in charge here
until the Jem'Hadar...

616
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:18,536
I'm afraid you have
a loose thread right here.

617
00:34:19,876 --> 00:34:22,747
I'm sorry,
but we are pressed for time.

618
00:34:22,783 --> 00:34:24,777
I'll get Sisko.

619
00:34:24,821 --> 00:34:27,521
Doctor, if you'd be so kind
as to take his legs.

620
00:34:27,561 --> 00:34:28,586
If I didn't know better

621
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,395
I'd say you were
enjoying yourself, Garak.

622
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:31,403
Oh, not at all, Doctor

623
00:34:31,437 --> 00:34:33,237
but after years
of hemming women's dresses

624
00:34:33,275 --> 00:34:35,212
a little action is
a welcome change of pace.

625
00:34:37,317 --> 00:34:39,379
I hope you feel the same
way an hour from now.

626
00:34:39,423 --> 00:34:41,417
The first thing we need to do is
to get our hands on a runabout.

627
00:34:41,461 --> 00:34:43,898
It's already taken
care of, Benjamin.

628
00:34:43,933 --> 00:34:46,906
The Chief's waiting for us
at Landing Pad C

629
00:34:46,974 --> 00:34:48,705
with the <i>Rio Grande</i>

630
00:34:48,745 --> 00:34:50,841
and a full compliment
of photon torpedoes.

631
00:34:50,883 --> 00:34:52,786
How did you know we needed
photon torpedoes?

632
00:34:52,822 --> 00:34:53,916
I know you.

633
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:55,517
You want to make sure
the Dominion

634
00:34:55,562 --> 00:34:57,031
stays on their side
of the galaxy

635
00:34:57,065 --> 00:34:58,295
and the only way to do that

636
00:34:58,335 --> 00:35:00,431
is to collapse the entrance
to the wormhole.

637
00:35:00,474 --> 00:35:01,875
I'm glad we're all in agreement.

638
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,072
Well, I guess this means

639
00:35:03,113 --> 00:35:04,707
the end
of our Starfleet careers.

640
00:35:04,751 --> 00:35:06,018
Oh, I wouldn't worry
about that, Doctor.

641
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,551
Well, that's easy
for you to say.

642
00:35:07,587 --> 00:35:09,455
Oh, you misunderstand
me, Lieutenant.

643
00:35:09,492 --> 00:35:10,984
All I meant was
it's a little foolish

644
00:35:11,029 --> 00:35:13,193
to worry about your careers
at a time like this

645
00:35:13,234 --> 00:35:16,640
when there's a good chance
we're all about to be killed.

646
00:35:24,026 --> 00:35:25,495
Interesting.

647
00:35:25,531 --> 00:35:27,729
Judging by this
locking mechanism

648
00:35:27,769 --> 00:35:31,175
the purpose of this door
is not to keep people out

649
00:35:31,211 --> 00:35:35,847
but rather to keep
whatever's on the other side in.

650
00:35:35,889 --> 00:35:38,019
Do you think you
can get it open?

651
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,894
We'll see.

652
00:35:48,452 --> 00:35:49,819
Halt!

653
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,257
Put down your weapons.

654
00:35:51,293 --> 00:35:52,956
I have them, I have them.

655
00:35:52,996 --> 00:35:55,662
By all means, Commander,
do as they say.

656
00:35:55,703 --> 00:35:56,831
Garak.

657
00:35:56,872 --> 00:35:58,341
Now you heard me, Doctor.

658
00:35:58,376 --> 00:36:00,745
Well, I'm glad to see
the plan is going as scheduled.

659
00:36:00,782 --> 00:36:02,183
What plan is that?

660
00:36:02,219 --> 00:36:05,090
You mean no one told you?

661
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:09,295
You see, I pretend
to be their friend

662
00:36:09,336 --> 00:36:11,033
and then I shoot you.

663
00:36:13,378 --> 00:36:14,574
Well done, Garak.

664
00:36:14,615 --> 00:36:17,052
Well, it's just something
I read once in a book.

665
00:36:17,088 --> 00:36:18,387
I'm sure.

666
00:36:19,393 --> 00:36:20,156
Garak!

667
00:36:20,195 --> 00:36:21,494
Garak.

668
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:26,768
Doctor, I'm afraid
I won't be able

669
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:30,080
to have lunch
with you today.

670
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:32,613
We've got to go.
Come on.

671
00:36:52,238 --> 00:36:53,571
Move it, Lieutenant.

672
00:36:53,608 --> 00:36:54,770
I'm right behind you.

673
00:36:58,086 --> 00:37:00,923
Get us out of here, Chief.

674
00:37:00,959 --> 00:37:02,087
What about Garak?

675
00:37:02,129 --> 00:37:03,257
He's not coming.

676
00:37:03,298 --> 00:37:04,562
I see.

677
00:37:04,601 --> 00:37:06,401
Hang on.

678
00:37:06,473 --> 00:37:08,376
We'll reach the wormhole
in 30 seconds.

679
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:10,939
Prepare to launch
photon torpedoes.

680
00:37:10,983 --> 00:37:12,384
We're being hailed.

681
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,049
It's Admiral Nechayev.

682
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:16,357
Commander, I'm ordering you
to stand down.

683
00:37:16,397 --> 00:37:18,425
Return to the station
immediately.

684
00:37:18,535 --> 00:37:20,768
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to refuse that order.

685
00:37:20,807 --> 00:37:21,969
Please, Commander

686
00:37:22,009 --> 00:37:24,573
don't make us send
the Jem'Hadar after you.

687
00:37:24,616 --> 00:37:27,316
Go right ahead,
but you better warn them

688
00:37:27,356 --> 00:37:30,990
not to expect any reinforcements
for about 70 years.

689
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,183
Attack pattern theta,
Mr. O'Brien. Hard a-port.

690
00:37:39,217 --> 00:37:40,811
Yes, sir.

691
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,864
Step back, Major.

692
00:38:18,177 --> 00:38:21,082
Please, come in.

693
00:38:24,025 --> 00:38:25,221
Commander.

694
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,730
They can't hear you.

695
00:38:26,765 --> 00:38:28,496
What have you done to them?

696
00:38:28,535 --> 00:38:29,503
Nothing harmful.

697
00:38:29,538 --> 00:38:31,839
We're just conducting
a little experiment.

698
00:38:31,877 --> 00:38:33,403
What kind of experiment?

699
00:38:33,447 --> 00:38:36,215
To see how they'd respond
to an attempt by the Dominion

700
00:38:36,254 --> 00:38:38,783
to gain a foothold
into the Alpha Quadrant.

701
00:38:38,827 --> 00:38:39,989
We were curious to see

702
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:42,092
how much they'd be
willing to sacrifice

703
00:38:42,134 --> 00:38:43,865
in order to avoid a war.

704
00:38:43,906 --> 00:38:45,307
And what have you found out?

705
00:38:45,343 --> 00:38:46,333
Unfortunately...

706
00:38:47,448 --> 00:38:50,546
...they're proving to be
just as stubborn as I'd feared.

707
00:38:50,588 --> 00:38:51,887
I'm glad to hear it.

708
00:38:51,925 --> 00:38:53,087
You are?

709
00:38:53,128 --> 00:38:57,093
Well, that is a problem.

710
00:38:57,137 --> 00:39:01,307
But, thankfully,
it's not one I have to solve.

711
00:39:01,347 --> 00:39:03,341
But I do.

712
00:39:04,956 --> 00:39:06,653
I don't understand.

713
00:39:06,694 --> 00:39:08,425
You knew about this?

714
00:39:08,464 --> 00:39:10,161
Yes.

715
00:39:10,202 --> 00:39:12,105
But how could you allow it?

716
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:14,475
You belong to the Dominion,
don't you?

717
00:39:14,513 --> 00:39:15,846
Belong to it?

718
00:39:15,883 --> 00:39:19,187
Major, the changelings
are the Dominion.

719
00:39:25,172 --> 00:39:27,040
You're the Founders.

720
00:39:27,076 --> 00:39:28,545
Ironic, isn't it?

721
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:30,276
The hunted now control

722
00:39:30,317 --> 00:39:32,949
the destinies
of hundreds of other races.

723
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:34,482
But...

724
00:39:34,527 --> 00:39:36,794
why control anyone?

725
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:40,034
Because what you can control
can't hurt you.

726
00:39:40,073 --> 00:39:43,069
So, many years ago,
we set ourselves the task

727
00:39:43,115 --> 00:39:46,054
of imposing order
on a chaotic universe.

728
00:39:46,088 --> 00:39:48,355
Is that what you call it?
Imposing order?

729
00:39:48,393 --> 00:39:49,885
I call it murder.

730
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:53,872
What you call it is
no concern of ours.

731
00:39:53,907 --> 00:39:57,177
How do you justify
the deaths of so many people?

732
00:39:57,214 --> 00:39:59,948
The solids have always
been a threat to us...

733
00:39:59,988 --> 00:40:01,582
that's the only
justification we need.

734
00:40:01,626 --> 00:40:04,190
Well, these solids
have never harmed you.

735
00:40:04,231 --> 00:40:07,831
They travel the galaxy in order
to expand their knowledge

736
00:40:07,873 --> 00:40:09,240
just as you once did.

737
00:40:09,277 --> 00:40:11,977
The solids are nothing like us.

738
00:40:12,017 --> 00:40:17,964
No... I suppose they're not.

739
00:40:20,136 --> 00:40:21,730
And neither am I.

740
00:40:21,774 --> 00:40:25,510
I've devoted my life
to the pursuit of justice

741
00:40:25,549 --> 00:40:29,115
but justice means nothing
to you, does it?

742
00:40:29,158 --> 00:40:31,254
It is not justice you desire,
Odo

743
00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:33,199
but order, the same as we do.

744
00:40:33,235 --> 00:40:35,867
And we can help you
satisfy that desire

745
00:40:35,908 --> 00:40:39,212
in ways the solids never could.

746
00:40:39,249 --> 00:40:40,775
This will all
become clear to you

747
00:40:40,886 --> 00:40:43,221
once you've taken your place
in the Great Link.

748
00:40:43,259 --> 00:40:45,093
No.

749
00:40:45,129 --> 00:40:49,800
I admit this...
Link of yours is appealing

750
00:40:49,841 --> 00:40:54,011
but you see, I already
have a link...

751
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:56,488
with these people.

752
00:40:56,523 --> 00:40:59,553
I want you to remove
those devices

753
00:40:59,598 --> 00:41:01,227
and bring them their combadges.

754
00:41:01,268 --> 00:41:02,669
We can't allow them to leave.

755
00:41:02,705 --> 00:41:05,176
And I can't allow you
to keep them here.

756
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:06,440
They're leaving.

757
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,544
And so am I.

758
00:41:09,588 --> 00:41:13,724
It's taken you many years
to find your way back home.

759
00:41:13,764 --> 00:41:17,637
Are you really willing
to leave it again so soon?

760
00:41:17,674 --> 00:41:19,668
Unless you intend to stop me.

761
00:41:19,713 --> 00:41:22,481
No changeling has
ever harmed another.

762
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:24,387
Whatever you do to them

763
00:41:24,423 --> 00:41:26,826
you're going
to have to do to me.

764
00:41:28,734 --> 00:41:30,203
They are free to go.

765
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:32,037
Thank you.

766
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:38,512
The next time, I promise you,
we will not be so generous.

767
00:41:46,376 --> 00:41:49,543
Major... Constable.

768
00:41:49,584 --> 00:41:51,349
What happened to the <i>Rio Grande?</i>

769
00:41:51,388 --> 00:41:53,552
The last thing I remember
is collapsing the wormhole.

770
00:41:53,593 --> 00:41:55,461
The last thing I remember
is being shot

771
00:41:55,498 --> 00:41:56,626
by some Jem'Hadar soldier.

772
00:41:56,667 --> 00:41:58,136
I'm sure it all
seemed very real

773
00:41:58,172 --> 00:41:59,801
but the truth is you've
been held in this room

774
00:41:59,842 --> 00:42:01,753
since the Jem'Hadar brought
you here from the <i>Defiant.</i>

775
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:04,119
Borath, what the hell
is going on here?

776
00:42:04,158 --> 00:42:05,525
Your ship is in orbit.

777
00:42:05,562 --> 00:42:07,760
You may transport back to it
whenever you're ready.

778
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,432
Commander,
I'll be along shortly.

779
00:42:12,211 --> 00:42:13,908
I'll stay down here
and make sure

780
00:42:13,949 --> 00:42:15,475
that he gets back
to the ship.

781
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:16,852
Another shape-shifter.

782
00:42:16,889 --> 00:42:18,188
Commander, you must leave now.

783
00:42:18,226 --> 00:42:20,493
I give you my word
I'll explain everything later.

784
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,203
I'll look forward to it.

785
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,308
Sisko to <i>Defiant.</i>

786
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:29,283
Five to beam up.

787
00:42:33,328 --> 00:42:36,324
I hope that one day
you'll return to us, Odo

788
00:42:36,402 --> 00:42:39,865
and take your rightful place
within the Dominion.

789
00:42:39,911 --> 00:42:42,007
I don't think that's possible.

790
00:42:42,049 --> 00:42:45,820
Your link to the solids
won't last.

791
00:42:45,858 --> 00:42:49,162
You will always be an outsider.

792
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:51,728
Being an outsider isn't so bad.

793
00:42:51,772 --> 00:42:54,745
It gives one
a unique perspective.

794
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,776
It's a pity
you've forgotten that.

795
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:00,850
Then perhaps one day,
I'll come visit you.

796
00:43:00,894 --> 00:43:04,836
The Alpha Quadrant seems
wracked with chaos.

797
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:07,137
It could use some order.

798
00:43:07,176 --> 00:43:11,209
Imposing your type of order
on the Alpha Quadrant

799
00:43:11,252 --> 00:43:14,749
may prove more difficult
than you imagine.

800
00:43:15,997 --> 00:43:19,768
We are willing to wait
until the time is right.

801
00:43:26,288 --> 00:43:29,125
We will miss you, Odo

802
00:43:29,162 --> 00:43:33,229
but you will miss us even more.

803
00:43:56,627 --> 00:43:58,119
Odo?

804
00:44:01,473 --> 00:44:03,967
Ready, Major.

805
00:44:16,509 --> 00:44:18,343
Kira to <i>Defiant.</i>

806
00:44:20,017 --> 00:44:22,011
Two to beam up.
