00:00:01,794 --> 00:00:06,047
NARRATOR: Last time on
<i>Star Trek: Deep Space 9...</i>

2
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:08,008
Our mission is to take
the<i> Defiant</i>

3
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:09,510
into the Gamma Quadrant
and try to find

4
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:12,262
the leaders of the
Dominion, the Founders.

5
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:14,640
What the hell is wrong
with Starfleet?

6
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:16,183
How could they
do this to him?

7
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:18,101
This has been a long time
coming, Major.

8
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,437
Starfleet has never been
happy with the Constable.

9
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:22,272
I want him to stay
as much as you do

10
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:23,691
but<i> he</i> has to want to stay.

11
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:27,862
Ever since we've come
into the Gamma Quadrant...

12
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:32,073
I've had this feeling...
of being drawn somewhere

13
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:33,784
to a specific place--

14
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,872
the Omarion Nebula.

15
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,377
(<i> yelling</i> )

16
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,511
(<i> yells</i> )

17
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,225
The last time
I saw the<i> Defiant</i>

18
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:00,644
she was dead in space
and surrounded

19
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:03,271
by Jem'Hadar ships.

20
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,774
Sisko? Bashir?

21
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:09,069
I don't know.

22
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:25,126
Welcome home.

23
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,088
<i>And now the conclusion.</i>

24
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:43,478
You really are just
like me, aren't you?

25
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,480
Yes.

26
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,908
ODO:
And you're saying,
this is where I'm from?

27
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,410
SHAPE-SHIFTER:
This is your home.

28
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,579
Ah, I wish I could
remember it.

29
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:03,498
It's understandable
that you cannot.

30
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,751
You were still newly formed
when you left us.

31
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:07,377
Newly formed?

32
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:08,796
You mean, I was
an infant?

33
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,257
An infant, yes.

34
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,760
Ah. I suspected
as much.

35
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:18,097
Tell me, do I have
any family at all?

36
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,765
Of course.

37
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:21,433
I'd like
to meet them

38
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:22,935
if that's
possible.

39
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:25,228
You already have.

40
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,355
We are all part

41
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:30,109
of the Great Link.

42
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,945
Is that all of us,
or are there others?

43
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:36,824
Odo, this isn't
a police investigation.

44
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,200
I'm aware of that, Major.

45
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:42,203
Well, then stop interrogating
these people.

46
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,999
This is the moment
you've been waiting for

47
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,458
all your life.

48
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,918
Enjoy it.

49
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:53,632
He really is
happy to be here.

50
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,383
Aren't you?

51
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,469
Yes, of course.

52
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,309
It's just that this
is all very sudden.

53
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,520
And you have many questions.

54
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,313
Yes.

55
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,940
Please...

56
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:16,989
what exactly is
this Great Link?

57
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:19,158
The Link is
the very foundation

58
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:20,742
of our society.

59
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:23,328
It provides a meaning
to our existence.

60
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,081
It is the merging
of form and thought

61
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,542
the sharing of idea
and sensation.

62
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:31,837
Is something wrong?

63
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:41,555
I've... lived
a very solitary life.

64
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,725
That's unfortunate,
but necessary

65
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,352
as you'll
learn in time.

66
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:50,981
But now, that part
of your life is over.

67
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:52,649
You're home.

68
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:55,485
What are you doing?

69
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,071
Take it.

70
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:58,488
But it's not time.

71
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,865
He isn't ready.

72
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,658
He's been
gone too long.

73
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,535
He needs
to remember

74
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,871
if only
for a moment.

75
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,915
Don't be afraid.

76
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,357
(<i> deep exhale</i> )

77
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,823
Odo...

78
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,951
What have you done to him?

79
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,203
I allowed him
to experience the Link.

80
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:49,372
Odo!

81
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,210
Yes, Major.

82
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:55,212
Are you all right?

83
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:56,797
What happened?

84
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,009
I'm not sure.

85
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,764
But I know one thing.

86
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,515
She's right.

87
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,354
I am... home.

88
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:22,150
Commander's Log, supplemental.

89
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:25,653
It's been six days since
we had to abandon the<i> Defiant</i>

90
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,488
after the Jem'Hadar attack.

91
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,366
We still don't know

92
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:32,452
what happened
to the rest of the crew.

93
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:36,290
Doctor Bashir and I have plotted
a course back to the wormhole.

94
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:39,042
Whether the shuttle
can get us back there or not

95
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,128
is questionable at best.

96
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,589
Our engines are failing

97
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:48,176
our external sensors
are barely functioning

98
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:52,597
and life support systems
are at 20% and dropping.

99
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,601
But other than that

100
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,728
we couldn't be
in better shape.

101
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,148
I thought you
were sleeping.

102
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,691
From the sound of things,
I wish I were.

103
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,026
It could be worse.

104
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,653
(<i> thudding crash</i> )

105
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,113
I believe you.

106
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,489
Do you think it's
some kind of tractor beam?

107
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,782
Could be.

108
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,409
I wish these sensors
were working.

109
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:14,911
(<i> metallic clanging</i> )

110
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,747
Now what?

111
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,213
Whoa, hey, don't shoot.

112
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:26,756
We surrender.

113
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:27,966
Chief, Dax.

114
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:28,800
BASHIR:
I don't believe it.

115
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,885
We thought you'd been
captured by the Jem'Hadar.

116
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,053
Well, we had our doubts

117
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,430
about ever seeing you again,
either, Julian.

118
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:34,931
We've been searching
for you for days.

119
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,183
What about the others?

120
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,852
No sign of them yet

121
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,895
but we still have ships
out looking for them.

122
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,189
O'BRIEN:
Meanwhile,
our orders are

123
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,607
to get you back to DS9
as soon as possible.

124
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,901
There are big things
happening there, Benjamin.

125
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,778
I think you're in
for a surprise.

126
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:57,829
KIRA:
This is beautiful.

127
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,456
(<i> Odo sighs</i> )

128
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:02,876
How long do they plan
on making us wait here?

129
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,711
We've only been here
a few hours.

130
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:07,588
Ha! I finally return home

131
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,008
and they still treat me
like an outsider.

132
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,470
Oh, believe me, you're not
the outsider here, I am.

133
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:14,179
You?

134
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,306
I'm the one they
don't trust, not you.

135
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,141
SHAPE-SHIFTER:
How perceptive, Major.

136
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:21,102
If our history
has taught us anything

137
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:24,939
it's to avoid contact
with solids whenever possible.

138
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,066
Solids?

139
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,359
Our name

140
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,277
for mono-forms like yourself

141
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,988
who will never know
the joys of the Great Link.

142
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,908
I don't intend to stay long.

143
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,701
There's a chance Sisko and
the others survived the attack.

144
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,495
I'm going to go back
to the shuttle

145
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:39,413
and try contacting them.

146
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:40,830
I'm sorry, I
cannot allow you

147
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:44,042
to send any communications
from the planet's surface.

148
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,586
They could be traced back here.

149
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:49,005
We value
our isolation.

150
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,965
Yes, of course.

151
00:09:56,763 --> 00:10:00,308
Tell me, Odo, have you made
good use of the arboretum?

152
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,481
In what way?

153
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:07,982
By assuming
the various shapes

154
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,317
surrounding you.

155
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,820
Why would I do that?

156
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:17,367
To become a thing
is to know a thing.

157
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:21,955
To assume its form is to begin
to understand its existence.

158
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,791
Understand it?
How?

159
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,126
Living among the solids

160
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,878
has damaged you far worse
than I realized.

161
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,714
It has left you ignorant
of the gifts you possess.

162
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,805
Then teach me
what I need to know.

163
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,515
I'll do what I can.

164
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:50,650
But in the end,
this is another journey

165
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,778
you'll have
to make on your own.

166
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,824
And when it is over

167
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,742
you'll be ready
to take your place

168
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,077
in the Great Link.

169
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,012
Odo.

170
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:25,018
I'd like to be alone,
if you don't mind.

171
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:27,562
All right.

172
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,814
But if you need me

173
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,526
I'll be in the shuttle
trying to contact Sisko.

174
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:33,776
Don't worry.

175
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,112
When I was in the resistance,
I learned to camouflage

176
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:38,406
subspace messages
using quantum interference.

177
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:41,117
I taught the method
to Commander Sisko.

178
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,411
If anyone intercepts the signal,
all they'll read

179
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,830
is elevated levels
of background radiation.

180
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,208
Good luck.

181
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:50,960
You, too.

182
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,764
NECHAYEV:
Well, Commander,
it appears your mission

183
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,059
was an even greater
success than we hoped.

184
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,894
So I'm told.

185
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,437
Has the delegation
from the Founders

186
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:10,855
arrived on
the station yet?

187
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,691
They're already meeting
with representatives

188
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,192
from the Federation Council

189
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,777
and a dozen other
Alpha Quadrant alliances.

190
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,196
We're hoping to have
a treaty signed

191
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,864
within a matter of days

192
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,283
and we have you
to thank for it.

193
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,911
Actually, it's Lieutenant Dax
and Chief O'Brien

194
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,496
who deserve
most of the credit.

195
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:27,581
Well, we were lucky
the Jem'Hadar

196
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,249
handed us over
to the Founders.

197
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,543
We just had to convince them
we were serious about peace.

198
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:34,254
Actually, it didn't take
that much convincing.

199
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,005
I suppose
the only question is

200
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:37,798
can we trust them?

201
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,222
It's a risk, I know

202
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,974
but both the Federation Council
and Starfleet Command

203
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,185
believe
it's one worth taking.

204
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:52,063
By the way, Commander, one of
the Founders asked to see you

205
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,814
the moment you arrive
on the station.

206
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,066
Asked to see me?

207
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,318
If you're not too busy.

208
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,531
Well, I suppose I could
spare a few minutes.

209
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,040
MALE:
Commander Sisko,
come in.

210
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:15,086
I've looked forward
to meeting you.

211
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,504
I am Borath.

212
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,549
And you're one of the Founders?

213
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:21,050
That's correct.

214
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:22,761
You seem surprised.

215
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:25,430
Not really, only...

216
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,434
I hadn't realized till now

217
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,311
I've already met
one of your people.

218
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,353
You're referring

219
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,314
to Eris, of course.

220
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:37,066
Yes, she is one of us.

221
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,026
Though she couldn't
very well admit it

222
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,529
while you were pointing
a phaser at her.

223
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:44,907
(<i> chuckles</i> ):
I am glad to see
you're not holding one now.

224
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,242
Do I need one?

225
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:47,285
Oh, not at all.

226
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,329
You seem skeptical.

227
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,913
Can you blame me?

228
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,874
No, I realize

229
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,960
you have no reason
to trust the Dominion

230
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,796
but you must understand

231
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:00,298
that we were only trying
to defend ourselves.

232
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,508
From what?

233
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,509
We felt threatened

234
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,386
by your incursions
into the Gamma Quadrant.

235
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:07,888
And now?

236
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,518
Commander, you
risked your life

237
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,771
to bring us a message
of peace and friendship.

238
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:17,106
We chose to
accept your offer.

239
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,861
Would you have
rather we refused?

240
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,905
No.

241
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:28,576
Good. Because
believe me, Commander

242
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:32,163
an alliance between the Dominion
and the Federation

243
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:35,375
will be beneficial
to both our people.

244
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:50,223
Doctor, welcome back.

245
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,474
Why, thank you, Garak.

246
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:52,517
It's good to be back.

247
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,351
Yes.

248
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,602
Business keeping you busy?

249
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:59,106
Oh, the tailoring business
or the spy business?

250
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,734
I'm joking, of course.

251
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,193
Of course.

252
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,361
I've missed you.

253
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,905
I've been genuinely
concerned for your safety.

254
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,324
Lunch hasn't been
the same without you.

255
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,702
That's very kind of you
to say so, Garak.

256
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,662
Hopefully, things'll
start getting back

257
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:13,705
to normal around here.

258
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,415
Oh, I doubt that's going
to happen, Doctor.

259
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,957
I doubt that very much.

260
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:17,792
And why is that?

261
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,960
There's an old saying
on Cardassia:

262
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,880
"Enemies make
dangerous friends."

263
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,172
And I fear the Dominion

264
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:25,675
will make a very dangerous
friend indeed.

265
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:27,761
I take it you're referring
to the peace talks.

266
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,929
Exactly. I'm afraid
these treaty negotiations

267
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,932
are a mistake we're going
to live to regret.

268
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,393
Is that your opinion
or the opinion

269
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,895
of the Cardassian
Central Command?

270
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,688
The former,
I assure you.

271
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,858
The Central Command is very
much in favor of this treaty

272
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,486
which, as far as I'm concerned,
only justifies my fears.

273
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,238
Well, I, for one

274
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,074
hope you're worrying
about nothing.

275
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,702
Subcommander T'Rul.

276
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:53,703
You all right?

277
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:54,913
I'm fine.

278
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,123
I had a minor disagreement
with some Starfleet

279
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,332
security officers.

280
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,959
They refused
to allow me to speak

281
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,086
with the Federation's
negotiating team.

282
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,004
Well, what did you want
to talk to them about?

283
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,924
I wanted to protest
the exclusion

284
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,551
of the Romulan Empire
from the treaty negotiations.

285
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:11,011
I wasn't aware the Romulans
had been excluded.

286
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,681
Every great power in the Alpha
Quadrant has been invited

287
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:16,142
to participate
except for us.

288
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,394
Then there must be some mistake.

289
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:21,272
The mistake is thinking
the Romulan Empire will stand by

290
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:24,400
and allow such a betrayal
to go unchallenged.

291
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:29,029
Believe me, Doctor, if a treaty
is signed without our approval

292
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,990
it will mean war.

293
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,536
Still feel
that I'm worrying

294
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,872
about nothing, Doctor?

295
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:43,085
Computer, transmit
a subspace signal

296
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,587
using a narrow
theta band frequency

297
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:47,423
shifted into
a background radiation domain.

298
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:48,967
COMPUTER:
Working.

299
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,844
I hope you're out there,
Commander.

300
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,513
Unable to transmit signal

301
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:56,933
due to external interference
at all frequencies.

302
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,854
Identify source of interference.

303
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,356
Interference generated
by thermal radiation

304
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,316
from a subterranean
power source.

305
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,777
Locate power source.

306
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:09,946
Power source is located

307
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:12,573
four kilometers
beneath the planet's surface.

308
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:16,035
Coordinates 127 mark 3.

309
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,244
Can you identify?

310
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:23,167
Unable to identify due to an
unknown poly-metallic substance

311
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,127
within the surrounding rock.

312
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,796
Any luck, Major?

313
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:29,048
No, some kind
of power source

314
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,341
is interfering
with my signal.

315
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,259
Do you have any idea
what it could be?

316
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,678
I haven't a clue.

317
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:37,598
Are you all right?

318
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,850
(<i> sighs</i> )

319
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:42,353
I have spent the last two hours
shape-shifting--

320
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:45,147
rocks, flowers, trees--

321
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:48,401
I have been everything
in that... garden.

322
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,988
And?

323
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,322
And nothing.

324
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:55,575
Oh, I can<i> become</i>
a rock all right

325
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:59,453
but I have no more of an idea
what it is to<i> be</i> a rock

326
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,080
than I did before.

327
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,125
I'm not really sure
what that means.

328
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,712
I'm not sure either

329
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,007
and that's... unfortunate.

330
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:15,053
(<i> sighs</i> )

331
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:19,974
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to return to my bucket.

332
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:30,317
DAX:
Commander, Admiral Nechayev
is here to see you.

333
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,904
Send her in.

334
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:34,405
(<i> door opens</i> )

335
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,532
NECHAYEV:
You asked to see
me, Commander?

336
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:38,076
I understand
that the Romulans

337
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,911
haven't been invited
to the peace talks.

338
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,037
That's correct.

339
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,247
I was wondering
what prompted that decision.

340
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:46,125
The Founders requested
that they be excluded.

341
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,460
Did they say why?

342
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,169
They felt the Romulans

343
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,671
would be
a disruptive influence.

344
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:53,674
More disruptive
than the Cardassians?

345
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:56,552
They seemed to think so.

346
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:58,220
Do you have a problem
with this, Commander?

347
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:01,057
Whether I have a problem with it
isn't the point.

348
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:03,476
It's the Romulans
we have to worry about.

349
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,895
Commander, if this treaty
is signed,

350
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:07,814
and I'm confident it will be,

351
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,357
we'll never have to worry
about the Romulans again.

352
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,525
Are you sure of that?

353
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,735
Quite sure.

354
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,737
After all, what chance
would they have

355
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:17,824
against the combined power
of our new alliance?

356
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,742
They wouldn't have
much of a chance at all.

357
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,619
I'm glad we agree.

358
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:23,871
Believe me, Commander

359
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,873
the Federation carefully
weighed all the options

360
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:28,042
before entering
into these peace talks.

361
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:31,462
I realize that.

362
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:35,299
Then we have nothing
further to discuss, do we?

363
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:47,895
Why do you dislike
humanoids so much?

364
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,522
I know they
have their flaws

365
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:53,192
but I've found many of them
to be kind, decent people.

366
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,945
Like Major Kira?

367
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:58,572
Yes, like Major Kira.

368
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,325
Then you've been more fortunate
than most changelings.

369
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,493
"Changelings?"

370
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,578
You recognize the term?

371
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:10,001
Hmm. I've been called
a "changeling" on occasion.

372
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:12,294
It's a name given
to us by the solids.

373
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,421
They meant it as an insult

374
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:18,009
but, in defiance,
we took it and made it our own.

375
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,887
Go on, please.

376
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,434
The Great Link tells us
that many years ago

377
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,896
our people
roamed the stars

378
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,690
searching out other races,
so we could add

379
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:35,193
to our knowledge
of the galaxy.

380
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,112
We went in peace,
but too often we were met

381
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:41,240
with suspicion,
hatred and violence.

382
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,366
Why?

383
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:46,412
The solids feared our
metamorphic abilities.

384
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:49,498
So we were beaten,
hunted and killed.

385
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,877
Finally, we arrived here.

386
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:53,794
And here

387
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:57,048
safe in our isolation,
we made our home.

388
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:01,385
Tell me... why was I sent away?

389
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,721
Because even in our isolation

390
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,473
we desired to learn
more about the galaxy.

391
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,684
You were one of
100 infants sent off

392
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:10,644
to gain that
knowledge for us.

393
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:11,771
But how could you be sure

394
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,981
that we'd find
our way back here?

395
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:16,025
You had no choice.

396
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:17,359
The urge to return home

397
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:20,029
was implanted
in your genetic makeup.

398
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:22,573
And now, thanks
to the passageway

399
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:25,284
you're the first one
to return to us.

400
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,286
We weren't expecting you
so soon.

401
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,538
When were you expecting me?

402
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,290
Not for another 300 years.

403
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:43,761
How long was I away?

404
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:47,056
A long time.

405
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:50,517
But now, all that matters
is that you're here.

406
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:55,481
It's...

407
00:21:57,108 --> 00:22:00,945
different than I
imagined it would be.

408
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:06,617
Whatever you imagined,
I promise it will be better.

409
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,286
Odo, are you here?

410
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:55,791
Odo...

411
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:59,170
I'm going to try to track
the source of the interference.

412
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:04,884
If I can't find it
and neutralize it

413
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,552
I'm going to have to leave here

414
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:09,096
and try to find
Sisko and the others.

415
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,062
(<i> sighs</i> )

416
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:19,565
I'm really glad
you made it home, Odo.

417
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:23,401
I know everything is going
to work out just fine.

418
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:26,906
I don't believe it.

419
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,449
I'm talking to a tree.

420
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:33,954
You're probably not
even here, are you?

421
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:53,266
Why would shape-shifters
need a door?

422
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,937
Kira to computer.

423
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:01,274
Scan the area dead ahead of me
for 100 meters.

424
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:05,986
Unable to penetrate
due to interference.

425
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:19,917
QUARK:
Excuse me.

426
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:21,877
Pardon me.

427
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,255
After you.

428
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:27,341
Look out.
Coming through.

429
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:29,343
Sorry to keep you
waiting, gentlemen.

430
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:33,722
That's two synthales,
on the house.

431
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:35,349
What's put you
in such a good humor?

432
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:37,184
I have inside information

433
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:40,062
that the peace agreement
is about to be finalized.

434
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:41,897
And where did you get
this information?

435
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:44,275
From one of your friends
on the Federation Council?

436
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:48,028
If you must know, I overheard
two Jem'Hadar officers.

437
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,529
And you
believed them?

438
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,407
I don't see why not.

439
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:53,742
Oh, I know we got off
to a rocky start

440
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:55,828
but they're not so bad.

441
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,246
Really.

442
00:24:57,288 --> 00:24:58,747
I think they have the gene.

443
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:00,124
What gene?

444
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,875
The gambling gene.

445
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,710
They've barely been
on this station a week

446
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,213
and already they can hardly
drag themselves away

447
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:07,089
from the dabo table.

448
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:09,633
How fortunate for you.

449
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:11,177
How fortunate

450
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,179
for all of us.

451
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,849
You see, I have a dream...

452
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,852
a dream that one day
all people--

453
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:22,938
human, Jem'Hadar, Ferengi

454
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,107
Cardassians--

455
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:27,109
will stand together in peace...

456
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,363
around my dabo tables.

457
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:32,323
You're a regular
visionary, Quark.

458
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,741
I am, aren't I?

459
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,288
You're in my way!

460
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:42,166
Sorry.

461
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,334
(<i> grunts</i> )

462
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:44,460
Now, look!

463
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,591
(<i> crowd gasps,</i>
<i>glass shatters</i> )

464
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:58,682
Gentlemen, please,
remember my vision.

465
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,142
That's enough.

466
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,561
All right.
What's going on here?

467
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:06,690
He addressed me in
a disrespectful tone.

468
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:07,649
That's a lie.

469
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,319
Easy, Doctor.
We're all friends here.

470
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:11,778
Tell him that.

471
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,989
I'll see this
doesn't happen again.

472
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:15,949
I expect you will.

473
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,955
Is that it?

474
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:24,250
You're just going to
let him walk away?

475
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,877
Our orders are to give
the Jem'Hadar a wide berth.

476
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,212
Look, I know what
the orders say

477
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:29,838
but he attacked
Chief O'Brien,

478
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,257
and we have rules here
against that sort of thing.

479
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:34,385
I'm aware of station
regulations, Doctor.

480
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:36,387
However,
the Jem'Hadar are not.

481
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:37,221
We have to allow them

482
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:39,848
some time to get used
to our customs.

483
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,725
So, in the meantime

484
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,436
they're free to do
whatever they want.

485
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:44,728
Remember that

486
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,689
before you get into
another brawl with them.

487
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:56,073
JAKE:
Dad, pass me
the potatoes.

488
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:57,032
Dad?

489
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,826
Yes, Jake.

490
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,245
The potatoes.

491
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:03,872
Oh.

492
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:06,083
Dad, is something wrong?

493
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:06,959
(<i> sighs</i> )

494
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,378
Not really.

495
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,672
I'm just a little preoccupied,
that's all.

496
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,553
It's these Dominion
negotiations.

497
00:27:17,595 --> 00:27:19,221
What about them?

498
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:20,764
Well, it's
all happening

499
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:22,182
behind closed doors.

500
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:25,852
I... I guess I just feel...

501
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,357
out of the loop.

502
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,942
There's something going on,
isn't there?

503
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:33,902
Like what?

504
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,322
You tell me.

505
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:40,576
(<i> door chimes</i> )

506
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:41,577
Come in.

507
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:43,912
Benjamin.

508
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:46,706
Did you know about this?

509
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:47,749
Know about what?

510
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,502
I being transferred
to the<i> Lexington.</i>

511
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:51,337
I'm their new
Science Officer.

512
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,670
There must be
some mistake.

513
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,590
The orders are
right here.

514
00:27:54,632 --> 00:27:56,091
Let me see this.

515
00:27:58,344 --> 00:27:59,761
I don't believe it.

516
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:01,013
Bashir to Sisko.

517
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,306
Go ahead, Doctor.

518
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:05,267
Commander, I need to talk
to you about the Jem'Hadar.

519
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:11,273
I want to know
what the hell is going on!

520
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:13,651
Commander, I don't appreciate
your barging in here.

521
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:15,319
I want to know
why my Science Officer's

522
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:17,154
been transferred
without my consent.

523
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,822
I want to know
why my Chief of Operations

524
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:20,658
is lying in the Infirmary

525
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:23,076
while the Jem'Hadar who beat him
is free to walk the station.

526
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,412
And I want to know
why the Federation is willing

527
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:27,498
to risk a war with the Romulans
to form an alliance

528
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,167
with a group of people that we
hardly know and barely trust!

529
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:31,418
Are you finished?

530
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,462
I haven't even begun!

531
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:35,631
BORATH:
Admiral, I think you

532
00:28:35,673 --> 00:28:39,968
should tell Commander Sisko
what he wants to know.

533
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,471
All right, I
suppose he deserves

534
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:44,431
to be the first
to hear the news.

535
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:45,932
What news?

536
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,935
The Federation is pulling
out of this sector.

537
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,312
All Starfleet
personnel currently

538
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:52,439
stationed on DS9
will be reassigned

539
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:53,649

540
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:54,650
Yourself included.

541
00:28:54,692 --> 00:28:56,026
What about Bajor?

542
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:59,196
Our plans for Bajor
are on hold for the time being.

543
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:01,990
From now on, Bajor will be
the Dominion's responsibility.

544
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:04,159
They'll be running
this station.

545
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:07,371
And you're telling me that the
Bajorans have agreed to this?

546
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:09,206
We're confident
they'll have no objections.

547
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,584
And if they do object,
what then?

548
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,502
You send in the Jem'Hadar?

549
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:15,295
BORATH:
The Jem'Hadar
are used

550
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:17,005
only against
our enemies.

551
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:20,259
Bajor will be protected,
Commander.

552
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,010
We'll see to it.

553
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:23,596
What about the wormhole?

554
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:25,305
Will they get
to protect that, too?

555
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:28,016
It's the price of peace,
Benjamin.

556
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:32,104
Well, if you ask me,
the price is too damned high.

557
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,856
What is the Federation supposed
to get out of all of this?

558
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,316
Our friendship.

559
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:38,860
Isn't that enough?

560
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,238
NECHAYEV:
And you, Benjamin,
get a promotion...

561
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,449
Captain Sisko.

562
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,950
It's an important step

563
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:47,369
toward that Admiralcy
you've always wanted.

564
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:50,372
I want a chance to speak to
the Federation negotiating team

565
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:52,082
before this treaty is signed!

566
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,833
It's too late for that, Ben.

567
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:56,587
The treaty was signed
late this afternoon.

568
00:29:57,588 --> 00:29:58,714
(<i> sighs in frustration</i> )

569
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:01,007
(<i> pounds table</i> )

570
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,427
It's the beginning
of a new era, Commander

571
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:05,178
and you helped
make it possible.

572
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:07,556
Congratulations.

573
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:16,898
(<i> squawks</i> )

574
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:26,533
Odo.

575
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:29,077
I've been
waiting for you.

576
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,704
Major!

577
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:35,000
I have just had the most
remarkable experience.

578
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,001
For a few moments

579
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,253
I actually felt
what it was like

580
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:41,590
to<i> be</i> an Arbazon vulture.

581
00:30:41,632 --> 00:30:45,177
The air currents
beneath my wings

582
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:49,931
the exhilaration of soaring
above the treetops.

583
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:53,977
Oh, it was all...
very stimulating.

584
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,646
I'm so happy for you.

585
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:57,063
I know you are.

586
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:59,692
So, I guess this means

587
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:02,152
you'll be staying
here a while.

588
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:08,742
I've enjoyed working
with you, Major.

589
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:13,205
I've enjoyed working
with you, too, Odo.

590
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:18,877
But, before
we say good-bye

591
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,962
I need your help
one last time.

592
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:21,963
Certainly.

593
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,048
Remember that
power source

594
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,299
I was telling you about?

595
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:25,634
The one preventing you

596
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:27,260
from trying to contact
Commander Sisko.

597
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,595
Well, I found it.

598
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:30,055
And what did it turn out to be?

599
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:31,056
I couldn't tell.

600
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:33,266
There was a door
blocking my path.

601
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,560
I need you to help me open it.

602
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,061
What kind of door?

603
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,521
It's composed
of some kind metal

604
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:39,105
that the tricorder
couldn't identify.

605
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:42,359
Other than that, it,
it's an ordinary door.

606
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:43,736
That's odd.

607
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:45,404
My people have
no need for doors.

608
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,656
They dislike taking
humanoid form.

609
00:31:47,698 --> 00:31:49,157
I know.

610
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:51,117
Then who could be using it?

611
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:58,291
Ah, Commander.

612
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:01,461
I was hoping to see
you before you left.

613
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:02,838
I just wanted
to tell you

614
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,173
how impressed
I've been with you

615
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:06,925
during these
past two years.

616
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:08,218
You've run this station

617
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,597
with strength, dignity
and compassion.

618
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,014
Well done.

619
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:18,061
Thank you, Mr. Garak.

620
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:21,481
But I'm sure you'll
be back before long.

621
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:23,734
Though from
what I've heard

622
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:26,986
it'll be to fight
against Bajor.

623
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,781
I've heard
the same rumors.

624
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:31,617
That Bajor has forged
a pact with the Romulans

625
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,952
to stand against
the Jem'Hadar...

626
00:32:34,912 --> 00:32:36,204
and their allies.

627
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:39,165
Oh, the Bajorans have fought
for their freedom before.

628
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:43,211
It only makes sense that
they'd fight for it again.

629
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:44,755
So much for
my peace mission.

630
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:45,839
Do I detect
a note

631
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:47,633
of bitterness in your voice?

632
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,509
I wouldn't be surprised.

633
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:52,387
If it means anything to you,
Commander

634
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:56,892
I happen to share your feelings
about this Dominion treaty.

635
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:59,394
I've thought about it
a great deal

636
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:01,897
and the only explanation
I can find

637
00:33:01,939 --> 00:33:05,275
is that our leaders
have simply gone insane.

638
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:08,445
It seems that way.

639
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:12,658
Unfortunately, there's nothing
you or I can do about it.

640
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:14,576
I suppose not.

641
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:15,953
After all,
you have

642
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,246
your orders, and as for me,
well...

643
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:19,247
(<i> chuckles</i> )

644
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:20,707
I wouldn't dream

645
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:23,710
of opposing the wishes
of the Central Command.

646
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:25,712
Pity.

647
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,298
I agree...

648
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:32,051
that it's a pity.

649
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:35,305
I thought you would.

650
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:41,394
Mr. Garak, I never knew
we thought so much alike.

651
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:46,191
Life is full of surprises,
Commander.

652
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,317
Hmm.

653
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:50,737
T'RUL:
Commander Sisko!

654
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:52,155
Ah! There she is!

655
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,616
No!

656
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,330
(<i> groaning</i> )

657
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,669
EDDINGTON:
Can I help you?

658
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:07,546
We're here to see
Commander Sisko.

659
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,422
Sorry, my orders are
no one sees him.

660
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,299
But we're here
on urgent business.

661
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:12,843
Well, you'll have to talk
to Admiral Nechayev.

662
00:34:12,885 --> 00:34:14,761
She's in charge here
until the Jem'Hadar...

663
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:15,762
I'm afraid you have

664
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:17,472
a loose thread
right here.

665
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:19,808
I'm sorry

666
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,643
but we are pressed for time.

667
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:24,103
I'll get Sisko.

668
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,565
Doctor, if you'd be so kind
as to take his legs.

669
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:27,983
If I didn't know better

670
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:29,192
I'd say you were
enjoying yourself, Garak.

671
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:30,569
Oh, not at all, Doctor

672
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,153
but after years
of hemming women's dresses

673
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,280
a little action is
a welcome change of pace.

674
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,284
I hope you feel the same
way an hour from now.

675
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,912
The first thing
we need to do is

676
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:41,329
to get our hands
on a runabout.

677
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:43,957
It's already taken
care of, Benjamin.

678
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:46,418
The Chief's waiting for us
at Landing Pad C

679
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,711
with the<i> Rio Grande</i>

680
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:49,838
and a full complement
of photon torpedoes.

681
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,049
How did you know we needed
photon torpedoes?

682
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,174
I know you.

683
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,509
You want to make sure
the Dominion

684
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:55,844
stays on their side
of the galaxy,

685
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:57,220
and the only way
to do that

686
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:59,222
is to collapse the entrance
to the wormhole.

687
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,682
I'm glad we're
all in agreement.

688
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:01,934
Well, I guess this means

689
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:03,602
the end
of our Starfleet careers.

690
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,645
Oh, I wouldn't worry
about that, Doctor.

691
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,105
Well, that's easy
for you to say.

692
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,941
Oh, you misunderstand
me, Lieutenant.

693
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:10,609
All I meant was
it's a little foolish

694
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,778
to worry about your careers
at a time like this,

695
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:16,031
when there's a good chance
we're all about to be killed.

696
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:26,207
Interesting.

697
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,584
Judging by this
locking mechanism

698
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:30,921
the purpose of this door
is not to keep people out

699
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:32,464
but rather to keep

700
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:35,550
whatever's on
the other side in.

701
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:37,677
Do you think you
can get it open?

702
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,137
We'll see.

703
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:49,397
Halt!

704
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:51,024
Put down
your weapons.

705
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:52,567
I have them,
I have them.

706
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:54,111
By all means,
Commander

707
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,320
do as they say.

708
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:56,113
Garak.

709
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,697
Now you heard
me, Doctor.

710
00:35:57,739 --> 00:35:58,698
Well, I'm glad to see

711
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,199
the plan is going
as scheduled.

712
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,701
What plan is that?

713
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:03,578
You mean no one told you?

714
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:07,791
You see, I pretend
to be their friend

715
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,626
and then I shoot you.

716
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,422
Well done, Garak.

717
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,508
Well, it's just something
I read once in a book.

718
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:17,801
I'm sure.

719
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:18,718
(<i> groaning</i> )

720
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,846
Garak!
Garak.

721
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:26,893
Doctor, I'm afraid
I won't be able

722
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:29,479
to have lunch
with you today.

723
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,982
We've got to go.
Come on.

724
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:54,129
Move it, Lieutenant.
I'm right behind you.

725
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,300
Get us out of here, Chief.

726
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,427
What about Garak?

727
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:02,679
He's not coming.

728
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:03,889
I see.

729
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:05,932
Hang on.

730
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:07,809
We'll reach the wormhole
in 30 seconds.

731
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:10,311
Prepare to launch
photon torpedoes.

732
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:13,398
We're being hailed.
It's Admiral Nechayev.

733
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:15,859
Commander, I'm ordering you
to stand down.

734
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:17,736
Return to the station
immediately.

735
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,155
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to refuse that order.

736
00:37:20,197 --> 00:37:21,364
Please, Commander

737
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:23,909
don't make us send
the Jem'Hadar after you.

738
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,661
Go right ahead,
but you better warn them

739
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:30,289
not to expect any reinforcements
for about 70 years.

740
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:38,590
Attack pattern theta,
Mr. O'Brien. Hard a-port.

741
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,175
Yes, sir.

742
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,942
(<i> whirring clicks</i> )

743
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,860
(<i> lock disengaging</i> )

744
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,113
Step back, Major.

745
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:20,381
Please, come in.

746
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,553
Commander.

747
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:26,638
They can't hear you.

748
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:27,847
What have you
done to them?

749
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:28,974
Nothing harmful.

750
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:31,434
We're just conducting
a little experiment.

751
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:32,936
What kind of experiment?

752
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:35,563
To see how they'd respond
to an attempt by the Dominion

753
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:38,108
to gain a foothold
into the Alpha Quadrant.

754
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,525
We were curious to see

755
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,444
how much they'd be
willing to sacrifice

756
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:43,113
in order to avoid a war.

757
00:38:43,155 --> 00:38:44,614
And what have you found out?

758
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:47,284
Unfortunately...
(<i> chuckles</i> )

759
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,869
...they're proving to be
just as stubborn as I'd feared.

760
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:51,288
I'm glad to hear it.

761
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,413
You are?

762
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:56,751
Well, that is a problem.

763
00:38:56,793 --> 00:39:00,588
But thankfully,
it's not one<i> I</i>  have to solve.

764
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,423
SHAPE-SHIFTER:
But I do.

765
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:05,844
I don't understand.

766
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,595
You knew about this?

767
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:09,472
Yes.

768
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,308
But how could
you allow it?

769
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,685
You belong to the
Dominion, don't you?

770
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,770
Belong to it?

771
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:18,397
Major, the changelings
<i>are</i> the Dominion.

772
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:26,239
You're the Founders.

773
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,449
Ironic, isn't it?

774
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,993
The hunted now control

775
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:32,120
the destinies
of hundreds of other races.

776
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:33,079
But...

777
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:35,915
why control anyone?

778
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:39,919
Because what you can control
can't hurt you.

779
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:42,463
So, many years ago,
we set ourselves the task

780
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:45,217
of imposing order
on a chaotic universe.

781
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:47,844
Is that what you call it?
Imposing order?

782
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:49,637
I call it murder.

783
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:53,141
What you call it is
no concern of ours.

784
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:56,353
How do you justify
the deaths of so many people?

785
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,855
The solids have always
been a threat to us--

786
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:00,899
that's the only
justification we need.

787
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,442
Well, these solids
have never harmed you.

788
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:06,946
They travel the galaxy in order
to expand their knowledge

789
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:08,406
just as you once did.

790
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:11,201
The solids are nothing like us.

791
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:16,873
No... I suppose they're not.

792
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,711
And neither am I.

793
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:25,423
I've devoted my life
to the pursuit of justice,

794
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:28,343
but justice means nothing
to you, does it?

795
00:40:28,385 --> 00:40:31,137
It is not justice
you desire, Odo

796
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:33,848
but order, the same as we do.

797
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:36,017
And we can help you
satisfy that desire

798
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:38,728
in ways the solids never could.

799
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,146
This will all
become clear to you

800
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:42,565
once you've taken your place
in the Great Link.

801
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:44,567
No.

802
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:49,239
I admit this...
Link of yours is appealing,

803
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,742
but you see, I already
have a link...

804
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,494
with these people.

805
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58,497
I want you to remove
those devices

806
00:40:58,539 --> 00:40:59,707
and bring them
their combadges.

807
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:01,709
We can't allow
them to leave.

808
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:04,587
And I can't allow you
to keep them here.

809
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:05,588
They're leaving.

810
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:09,592
And so am I.

811
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:13,679
It's taken you many years
to find your way back home.

812
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,808
Are you really willing
to leave it again so soon?

813
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,768
Unless you intend to stop me.

814
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,646
No changeling has
ever harmed another.

815
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,398
Whatever you do to them

816
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,817
you're going
to have to do to me.

817
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,279
They are free to go.

818
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,448
Thank you.

819
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:37,412
The next time, I promise you,
we will not be so generous.

820
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,547
Major... Constable.

821
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:50,508
What happened to
the<i> Rio Grande?</i>

822
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:52,718
DAX:
The last thing I remember
is collapsing the wormhole.

823
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,471
T'RUL:
The last thing I remember
is being shot

824
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,680
by some Jem'Hadar soldier.

825
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:57,098
I'm sure it all
seemed very real

826
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,392
but the truth is you've
been held in this room

827
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:01,894
since the Jem'Hadar brought
you here from the<i> Defiant.</i>

828
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,729
Borath, what the hell
is going on here?

829
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,231
Your ship is in orbit.

830
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:07,317
You may transport back to it
whenever you're ready.

831
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,735
ODO:
Commander, I'll
be along shortly.

832
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:13,281
I'll stay down here
and make sure

833
00:42:13,323 --> 00:42:14,782
that he gets back
to the ship.

834
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:16,201
Another shape-shifter.

835
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,827
Commander, you must leave now.

836
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:20,038
I give you my word I'll
explain everything later.

837
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:23,833
I'll look forward to it.

838
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:26,461
Sisko to<i> Defiant.</i>

839
00:42:27,379 --> 00:42:28,546
Five to beam up.

840
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:36,721
I hope that one day
you'll return to us, Odo

841
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:39,015
and take your rightful place
within the Dominion.

842
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:41,809
I don't think
that's possible.

843
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:44,312
Your link to the solids
won't last.

844
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:49,025
You will always
be an outsider.

845
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:51,236
Being an outsider
isn't so bad.

846
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:54,989
It gives one
a unique perspective.

847
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:57,992
It's a pity
you've forgotten that.

848
00:42:58,034 --> 00:43:01,204
Then perhaps one day,
I'll come visit you.

849
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:04,165
The Alpha Quadrant seems
wracked with chaos.

850
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:06,543
It could use some order.

851
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:11,672
Imposing your type of order
on the Alpha Quadrant

852
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:14,300
may prove more difficult
than you imagine.

853
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,097
We are willing to wait
until the time is right.

854
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,606
We will miss you, Odo,

855
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:32,485
but you will miss us even more.

856
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:58,052
Odo?

857
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,640
Ready, Major.

858
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,655
Kira to<i> Defiant.</i>

859
00:44:19,616 --> 00:44:21,659
Two to beam up.
