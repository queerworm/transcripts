1
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,091
If I'd known
what I was walking into,

2
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:09,802
I never would have gone.

3
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:11,762
It was your idea
to attend the conference

4
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:13,096
in the first
place, Garak.

5
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:15,891
I thought the Bajorans
would be grateful

6
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:17,225
to hear<i> someone</i>
provide them

7
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:19,311
with an opposing
philosophical view.

8
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:20,813
Opposing view?

9
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:22,314
Garak, you were trying

10
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:25,192
to defend the military
occupation of their world.

11
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:27,653
How grateful did you think
they would be?

12
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:29,864
My understanding
of this conference was

13
00:00:29,864 --> 00:00:32,282
that it was supposed to be
an examination of the occupation

14
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,827
from a dispassionate,
historical perspective.

15
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:37,412
Instead, everyone went
out of their way

16
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:40,207
to dismiss virtually everything
I had to say.

17
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:42,877
I thought the Bajorans
bent over backwards

18
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:44,586
to be polite to you, Garak.

19
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:46,714
Giving me a name tag that read

20
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:49,132
"Elim Garak--
Former Cardassian Oppressor"

21
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,592
was hardly polite.

22
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:53,929
And what did you want it to say?
"Former Spy"?

23
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,138
What I would have liked

24
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,850
was less posturing
and more debate.

25
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,184
It's clear to me now
that the Bajorans

26
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,561
aren't really interested

27
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,938
in discovering
historical truth

28
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:05,024
as much as they are in promoting

29
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:07,651
the myths and legends
of the "glorious resistance."

30
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:09,486
Well, Odo wasn't a member
of the resistance,

31
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,279
and he managed to attract

32
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,114
a fair amount
of attention.

33
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,700
Yes.

34
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,494
It seems you have
quite a fan club on Bajor.

35
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:18,829
I half-expected you

36
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:20,247
to be signing
autographs at the end.

37
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:21,665
Don't let him get to you, Odo.

38
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:22,917
You should be proud
of what you did

39
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:23,959
during the occupation.

40
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,003
I've nothing to be proud of.

41
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:28,380
I tried to bring order
to a chaotic situation.

42
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,131
That's all.

43
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:32,091
You need to give yourself
more credit, Constable.

44
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:34,302
Keeping order
during the occupation

45
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:37,138
would be a tough job for anyone,
but you not only did it,

46
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:40,225
you did it by earning
the trust of both sides.

47
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,394
DAX:
What was it
the moderator said?

48
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:45,022
That "you may have worked
for the Cardassians,

49
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:48,108
but your only master...
was justice."

50
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,902
And a legend is born.

51
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:01,080
Sir? Captain Sisko's runabout
is approaching the station.

52
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,664
Very well.

53
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,750
Clear them for docking
on Landing Pad 1.

54
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,834
Aye, sir.

55
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,837
Commander,
something's wrong.

56
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:11,006
They're not responding--
and sensors show

57
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:12,883
unusual EM signatures
along their hull.

58
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:15,135
The runabout's
on autopilot.

59
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,136
Life signs?

60
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,304
Four.

61
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,848
Very weak.

62
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,308
Disengage the autopilot.

63
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,102
Bring the runabout
to within transporter range.

64
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:24,853
Doctor Bashir
to Transporter Room 5.

65
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,229
Medical emergency.

66
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,492
WORF:
Check the aft compartment.

67
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:45,290
He's alive, but there's
an excess of neural energy

68
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,500
in his cerebral cortex.

69
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,127
What does that mean?

70
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:49,461
I'm not sure of that.

71
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,005
Can you revive them?

72
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:52,965
I'm not sure
of that, either.

73
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:55,425
(<i> low hum of machinery</i> )

74
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,344
(<i> murmur of voices</i> )

75
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:14,987
MALE (<i> over PA</i> ):
All prisoners
return to your quarters.

76
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,413
(<i> sighs</i> )

77
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,794
Show some dignity.

78
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,671
Look at you.

79
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,631
No wonder the Cardassians
think we're animals.

80
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,509
Get<i> up.</i>

81
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,219
Get up!

82
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,972
If you're going to spend
the night taking chemicals,

83
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:48,890
stay off the Promenade.

84
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,642
We don't need
another cleansing today.

85
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,439
What happened?

86
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,565
Not here.

87
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,526
I couldn't agree more.

88
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,069
MALE (<i> over PA</i> ):
All bio-organic material

89
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:05,740
must be disposed of
according to regulations.

90
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,332
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

91
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:15,167
There's a high level
of neural activity,

92
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,375
which suggests
that their conscious minds

93
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,003
are still active,

94
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:21,882
and yet, there's no response
to external stimuli.

95
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,925
What's the word on the runabout?

96
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,719
We have found
preliminary indications

97
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,096
that the ship encountered
a class-2 plasma storm,

98
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,472
which irradiated the vessel.

99
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:33,392
Computer,
are the neural readings

100
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:36,479
for subjects Odo, Sisko,
Dax, and Garak

101
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,439
consistent with the effects

102
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,317
of encountering
a class-2 plasma storm?

103
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,818
COMPUTER:
There are no recorded

104
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,487
causal relationships
between plasma storms

105
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,822
and specified neural readings.

106
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,448
BASHIR: None.

107
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:51,036
Computer, how many
medical records are there

108
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,372
on space plasma phenomena?

109
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:55,916
COMPUTER:
Five thousand twenty-one.

110
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,668
Well, it would appear
that a common phenomena

111
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,420
has had an uncommon
effect on our people.

112
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,173
Well, the runabout
is still being analyzed.

113
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,758
We should have
more information soon.

114
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,928
Good. In the meantime,
I have some reading to do.

115
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,481
This is Terok Nor--

116
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,525
DS9 during
the occupation.

117
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,777
Time travel?

118
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,362
Uh, no, it's
more than that.

119
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:26,738
Our clothes
have changed.

120
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,865
Could we be
in a holosuite?

121
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,617
Computer, end program.

122
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,704
Let's assume that's
a "no" for the moment.

123
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:38,333
Benjamin, we're not
attracting any attention.

124
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,834
And we should be.

125
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,879
Humans, Trills, and changelings
didn't just stroll

126
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,881
through Terok Nor unnoticed.

127
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,925
Well, then I should be getting
some attention as well.

128
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,052
We<i> are</i>
in the Bajoran sector,

129
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,971
and Cardassians
weren't exactly welcome here.

130
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,931
I don't think they see you
as a Cardassian.

131
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,767
I'm beginning to think
they don't see any of us

132
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,518
as who we really are.

133
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,271
The clothes we're wearing
are Bajoran.

134
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:00,563
They're treating us
like Bajorans.

135
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,982
Maybe they see us as Bajorans.

136
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,442
Any theories, old man?

137
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:05,652
Some kind
of cross-dimensional transfer?

138
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,528
Our conscious minds
might have been moved

139
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:08,947
through time and space

140
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,699
into the bodies
of four Bajorans on Terok Nor.

141
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,619
But then why are we still
seeing each other

142
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,871
as we really are,
instead of as Bajorans?

143
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,751
I just ran out of speculation.

144
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,795
The last thing I remember

145
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,672
was sitting in the runabout.

146
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,342
There was a plasma anomaly
on the sensors,

147
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,427
and then there was this sound.

148
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:31,636
No, not a sound.

149
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,805
More like
a strong vibration.

150
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:34,973
Hmm. I remember.

151
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,308
Odo?

152
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,726
I don't recall.

153
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:41,604
But whatever's happened,
we have to leave this place--

154
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,482
get<i> off</i> the station.

155
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:45,984
Then I suggest we go
directly to the authorities

156
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,068
and explain
our situation.

157
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,111
Garak.

158
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,321
I have knowledge

159
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:51,656
of certain... security codes

160
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,908
that would be sufficient
to prove that I am,

161
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:57,829
in fact, a Cardassian, even
if their eyes say otherwise.

162
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:00,499
I could always say that I'm
an undercover operative

163
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:01,749
posing as a Bajoran--

164
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,502
Captain, the authorities
on Terok Nor

165
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:05,712
will not be looking
for reasons to help us.

166
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:09,007
They will be looking
for a reason to interrogate us,

167
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,218
and believe me, you<i> do not</i> want

168
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,594
to be interrogated
by the Cardassians.

169
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,763
I tend to agree
with the Constable.

170
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,140
If they should discover

171
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,433
that we are actually
from the future...

172
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:19,767
Gul Dukat's
on the second level.

173
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,525
Let's move on.

174
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,131
(<i> gasps</i> )

175
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,638
SISKO:
Odo?

176
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,559
(<i> gasps</i> )

177
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:06,940
Who was that?

178
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,525
I don't know.

179
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:09,776
Well, you should.

180
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,027
It was your predecessor.

181
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,153
My predecessor?!

182
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,407
Oh... yes.

183
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:17,742
The man talking to Dukat.

184
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,453
His name is Thrax.

185
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:22,872
He was in charge of security
on the Promenade before me.

186
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,584
That means
we've gone back

187
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:26,834
at least
nine years.

188
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,753
You.

189
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:29,921
Come with us.

190
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,256
What's she done?!

191
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,508
Nothing... yet.

192
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,635
Perhaps there's been
some misunderstanding.

193
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,803
If I may be so bold,

194
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,722
you may find something
which will

195
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,600
bring you<i> infinitely</i>
more profit

196
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,977
than the arrest
of a Bajoran woman.

197
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,979
Latinum?

198
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,481
Two strips.

199
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:48,856
Where is it?

200
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:51,818
Ah, but our friend is
still in your custody.

201
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,034
Don't move!

202
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,078
(<i> groaning</i> )

203
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:04,789
Tempting offer.

204
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,625
Maybe next time.

205
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,460
This one's been selected.

206
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:10,920
I'll be all right.

207
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,095
Ooh.

208
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,601
Doctor.

209
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,622
Garak's septial capillaries
burst at this point.

210
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,706
The pattern
of his delta waves

211
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:50,377
show some unusual activity
at the same moment.

212
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:53,380
The bleeding
might be the result

213
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,508
of some kind
of psychosomatic response.

214
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:59,469
You mean, he<i> thought</i>
he was injured.

215
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,514
Well, under
certain conditions,

216
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:05,183
people have been known
to alter their blood pressure,

217
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:06,351
lower their
body temperature--

218
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,561
even manifest a tumor

219
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:09,062
as a result
of psychological stimuli.

220
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:13,149
Could these stimuli
cause more serious injuries?

221
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:16,069
I don't think he could
spontaneously break a bone,

222
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,279
but he could certainly
stop his heart

223
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,865
or break a key blood vessel
in his brain.

224
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,825
But what is causing all of this?

225
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,286
At the risk
of repeating myself,

226
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,538
I just don't know.

227
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,921
Step back from the gate.

228
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,556
He said,
"She's been selected."

229
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,140
What the hell does that mean?

230
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,435
Random interrogation,
forced labor relocation--

231
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:49,394
it could be anything.

232
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:50,729
That's not good enough.

233
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:52,105
I want to know
where they've taken her.

234
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,107
But before we can
help Commander Dax,

235
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:57,110
we need to find out who
we are in this reality.

236
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,612
If we could get
to a computer terminal,

237
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:00,238
we could ask
for a simple ID scan.

238
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:03,283
Computer access was extremely
limited on Terok Nor.

239
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:06,077
What about
a Cardassian comp-link?

240
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:07,120
Ha.

241
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,212
I took the liberty
of borrowing this

242
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,422
from the gentlemen

243
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,716
who thought my nose
needed adjustment.

244
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:22,719
I see I'm going to have
to add the word "pickpocket"

245
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:23,970
to your resume.

246
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,096
It's only a hobby.

247
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:26,765
Interesting

248
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:29,142
that a simple tailor
should just happen

249
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,561
to have
a high-level security code.

250
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:32,604
Yes, isn't it?

251
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:33,605
And if my nose

252
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,231
didn't hurt so much,

253
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,567
I'd tell you
a fascinating story

254
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,944
about how I came
to possess it.

255
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,070
Ah, yes.

256
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,697
Captain, you are actually

257
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:44,616
a Bajoran electronics engineer.

258
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:47,118
You're 38 years old,
you have no criminal record,

259
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,704
your family resides
in Rakantha Province,

260
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:52,499
and your name is Ishan Chaye.

261
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,543
Hmm. Lucky me.

262
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,587
I'm an artist.

263
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,213
I'm 55,
I've been arrested

264
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,174
three times
for disturbing the peace--

265
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,301
I must be incorrigible.

266
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:05,136
I also reside in Rakantha,

267
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:06,220
and my name is

268
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,515
Jillur Gueta.

269
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,016
And the Constable?

270
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,351
Ah, yes.

271
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,352
His profession is...

272
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:13,561
I'm a
bookkeeper.

273
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,439
46 years old.

274
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,024
I have a wife

275
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,610
and two sons
in Rakantha Province,

276
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,987
and my name is Timor Landi.

277
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,364
That's right.

278
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,073
How'd you know that?

279
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,952
Odo?

280
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,997
QUARK:
Congratulations, gentlemen.

281
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,124
You get to work today...

282
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:38,252
<i>and</i> you'll be laboring
in the finest establishment

283
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,504
on the station...

284
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:40,880
my establishment.

285
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,966
12 hours of work,
two five-minute

286
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:48,221
breaks--
one slip of latinum each.

287
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,306
Let's go.

288
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,644
Didn't you hear me?

289
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:57,355
I'm offering you<i> work.</i>

290
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,315
What are you waiting for?

291
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,650
N-nothing.

292
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,402
Just show us the way.

293
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,031
Open it.

294
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,119
Start by stepping
through the gate

295
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,622
that the nice man
has opened for you.

296
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,046
Very good.

297
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,549
You three must be
warp engineers.

298
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:27,427
Now, we're going
to walk down the Promenade

299
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,095
to the bar.

300
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,431
Would you like me
to hold your hands,

301
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,557
or can you manage it?

302
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:35,017
We'll manage.

303
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,310
I'm so glad.

304
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,565
How much damage would it do
to the timeline

305
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:44,068
if Quark were to suffer
a mysterious... accident?

306
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,612
I'm not sure,
but maybe

307
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:48,239
we should conduct
a little experiment

308
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,116
and find out.

309
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,461
Name?

310
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,589
Leeta.

311
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:07,884
Look at me when I speak
to you, Leeta.

312
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:14,682
She'll do.

313
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,650
<i>Kanar.</i>

314
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,370
For two.

315
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,255
(<i> sighs</i> )

316
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,257
Have you ever had<i> kanar?</i>

317
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,884
No.

318
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,678
Well, then this is an occasion.

319
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:56,015
You're trembling.

320
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,898
(<i> sighs</i> )

321
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,900
Despite what you
may have heard,

322
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,569
I'm a fair man, Leeta.

323
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,363
Rest assured

324
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,949
you have nothing to fear
from me.

325
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:15,493
I did not bring you here
to be abused.

326
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,203
Then why am I here?

327
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,505
It may surprise you
to hear this,

328
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:31,300
but my position is a lonely one.

329
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:36,639
I'm isolated from the people
who live under my protection.

330
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:39,392
I require<i> someone...</i>

331
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,643
to talk with.

332
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,230
In short...

333
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:47,901
a friend.

334
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,987
You want me to be your friend?

335
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,405
Ironic, isn't it?

336
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:56,450
That I should choose
a simple Bajoran girl

337
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,537
to share
my inner thoughts with.

338
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:04,333
But as you get to know me,
Leeta...

339
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:08,713
I think you'll find
that I'm a...

340
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,258
complicated man.

341
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,803
You're different
than I imagined.

342
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,557
To the beginning

343
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:22,142
of your education.

344
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,188
(<i> clinking glasses</i> )

345
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,086
I never knew
we were such messy conquerors.

346
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:50,046
I remember the occupation

347
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,214
being a little more<i> tidy</i>
than this.

348
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,549
Everything is tidy

349
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,301
when someone else
is doing the cleaning.

350
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,552
The Bajorans

351
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,012
were much more suited

352
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:00,473
for this sort of thing
than we were.

353
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,308
Servile work is in their nature.

354
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,895
I'll remember to mention that
to Major Kira when we get back.

355
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:08,982
There are exceptions
to every rule.

356
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,911
(<i> tray rattling</i> )

357
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,002
You all right?

358
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,339
The smell is making me sick.

359
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,882
Oh.

360
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,216
How did you know

361
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:39,053
your name would be Timor Landi
in this...

362
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:40,721
this whatever this is.

363
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,683
I recognized the other two names

364
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:48,062
from the security files
kept during the occupation.

365
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:52,025
Timor, Ishan, and Jillur
were the names of three Bajorans

366
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,861
who were accused of attempting
to assassinate

367
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:57,321
Gul Dukat
on the Promenade.

368
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:01,283
Half the resistance
tried to kill Dukat.

369
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,327
These three were innocent.

370
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,372
However, no one knew that
at the time,

371
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,625
and Dukat wanted
to make an example of them.

372
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,627
So he had them led
out onto the Promenade

373
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:15,131
and publicly... executed.

374
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,134
If we're them...

375
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,678
If we're them,
we better find a way out of here

376
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:23,472
before Dukat makes an example
out of us.

377
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:34,483
Quark,

378
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,069
I understand
you had a visit

379
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:38,154
from a Talavian freighter
captain this morning--

380
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,239
a Captain Livara,

381
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,574
I believe.

382
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,617
I had a lot of visitors
this morning.

383
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,119
It was a busy day.

384
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,245
I'm surprised

385
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,872
you're being so indiscreet.

386
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:50,290
Captain Livara
is a known smuggler.

387
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,667
You don't say?

388
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,920
Such a nice, friendly man, too.

389
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,254
I guess you never can tell

390
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,547
what some people
are really like.

391
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:01,928
Rumor has it that
the Obsidian Order has had him

392
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,596
under surveillance
for several months.

393
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,598
The Obsidian Order?

394
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,558
Rumor also has it
that they're bringing in

395
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:11,145
all of Livara's
coconspirators for...

396
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:12,980
questioning.

397
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,150
Well, you know how rumors are.

398
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,612
Yes.
They're usually true.

399
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:24,408
So, when the Order
asks me for a list

400
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,577
of all of Livara's
known associates

401
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:27,745
on board the station...

402
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:28,913
He was here
for ten minutes.

403
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,330
He wanted

404
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,167
to unload a shipment
of<i> maraji</i> crystals,

405
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:34,835
but I wasn't interested.

406
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,170
(<i> scoffs</i> )

407
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,880
I can't move
<i>maraji</i> crystals.

408
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,842
The Cardassians don't like them,

409
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,136
and the Bajorans

410
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:45,221
can't afford them,
so I sent him

411
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:46,722
on his way.

412
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,224
All right?

413
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:50,392
And that's all?

414
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,811
That's all.

415
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,939
I hope so...

416
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,482
because if I find out

417
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:59,359
that you've been dealing
in illegal crystals,

418
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:02,947
I'll hand you over
to the Order myself.

419
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,993
Always a pleasure.

420
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,875
I see you're not
the first man around here

421
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,294
to keep Quark
on his toes.

422
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:17,503
Yes.

423
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:18,796
Something's wrong.

424
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:21,257
Thrax talked about
a Captain Livara.

425
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:23,425
Does that name
mean something to you?

426
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,594
Livara wasn't just
another smuggler.

427
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,096
He was a Romulan spy

428
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,555
and didn't begin
working in this sector

429
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,183
until seven years ago,

430
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:33,769
but seven years ago,
Thrax wasn't on Terok Nor.

431
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,353
You were, Odo.

432
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:37,690
An odd contradiction.

433
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,399
So I checked the date.

434
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,235
This is seven years ago.

435
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:43,279
Thrax shouldn't be here.

436
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:45,656
You should be
the Security Chief.

437
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:48,159
None of this
makes any sense, Garak.

438
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,912
Now, I suggest we concentrate
on finding a way out of here.

439
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,331
That's our priority.

440
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:55,333
I tend to agree.

441
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,293
Well, you'll get
no argument from me...

442
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:58,669
but how?

443
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:01,379
We need to contact
the Bajoran resistance.

444
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:04,217
They might be able
to get us off the station.

445
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:06,177
Maybe even to the Federation.

446
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:08,888
Kira once told me
about a prearranged signal

447
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,931
the resistance used on Terok Nor

448
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,683
to set up a meeting.

449
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:14,476
Once we're finished here,
we'll head back

450
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:17,230
to the Bajoran sector,
and I'll make the signal.

451
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,331
Ah.

452
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:48,510
MALE (<i> on PA</i> ):
All recreation passes
are suspended

453
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:52,056
for Alpha unit personnel
until further notice.

454
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:06,153
The Bajorans never did
have a sense of style.

455
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,238
Turn the vase over

456
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:08,572
and the resistance
appears.

457
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,616
It's simple and effective.

458
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:12,076
And they did it
for years

459
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:13,744
right under
the Cardassians' noses.

460
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,790
Not under my nose, Captain.

461
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,292
Under his.

462
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:26,506
At least Dax is all right.

463
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:27,967
Look at him.

464
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:31,387
(<i> scoffs</i> ):
The Commander of Terok Nor.

465
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:34,890
Just another swaggering,
self-important Gul

466
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,893
with too much vanity
and not enough ability.

467
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:41,355
Maybe, but he's no fool.

468
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,404
Uh!

469
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:49,822
(<i> gasping</i> )

470
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:53,326
Are you all right?

471
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:56,870
Yes.

472
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,497
Just slipped out of my hand.

473
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:07,840
You wanted a meeting?

474
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,091
Don't look at me.

475
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:11,677
Eat your soup.

476
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:14,512
I didn't think you would come
while Dukat was here.

477
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:17,433
Everyone's watching
our gentle dictator

478
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:20,227
stroll the Promenade
with his new girlfriend.

479
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:24,731
Now, I hate soup,
and I have no intention

480
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:26,400
of finishing this entire bowl,

481
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,362
so whatever you want,
let's hear it.

482
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:30,988
We need to get off the station.

483
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,201
Why?

484
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:36,369
Does it matter?

485
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:38,536
Yes, as a matter of fact,
it does.

486
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:39,955
We're not a commuter service.

487
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,667
If you're running from a dispute

488
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,669
over chemicals
or women or smuggling,

489
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:46,795
you're on your own.

490
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:49,965
If you've killed
one of the spoon heads...

491
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,425
Spoon heads?!
Garak!

492
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,927
That's a different matter.

493
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:56,805
We're not who we seem to be.

494
00:25:56,805 --> 00:26:00,017
I hope not, because you seem
to be wasting my time.

495
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:02,978
Let's just say we're involved
with the Federation.

496
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,480
Let me guess.

497
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,274
You're Starfleet agents
operating undercover

498
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,942
posing as indigent Bajorans

499
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,444
who happen to be...

500
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:11,487
(<i> explosion</i> )

501
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:12,488
(<i> alarm blares</i> )

502
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:13,531
Dax!

503
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,242
No, no!

504
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:17,410
Captain! No!

505
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:22,331
PA:
Secure all exits on 4-Alpha.

506
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:23,541
Captain, w-we
can't stay here.

507
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:24,833
They'll take
care of her...

508
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:25,918
CARDASSIAN:
You two, halt!

509
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,420
But we must go!

510
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:32,299
CARDASSIAN:
Grab him!
Don't move!

511
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,015
(<i> people clamoring, pounding)</i>

512
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:52,403
You'd think they'd put us
in our own cell block

513
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:54,447
instead of with
the common criminals.

514
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:56,407
After all, we are
accused of attempting

515
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:58,284
to assassinate the
Station Commander.

516
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:00,744
That deserves
some respect.

517
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:03,330
Maybe they'll salute
when they execute us.

518
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,041
(<i> clamor intensifies</i> )

519
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,751
Quiet down.
Quiet down.

520
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,669
Quiet.
Quiet, please.

521
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:11,422
Quiet, please!

522
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:12,672
(<i> shouting stops</i> )

523
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:16,718
Kara Polus...

524
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,845
Brin Tusk...

525
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:21,140
and Marat Kobar...

526
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,059
your sentence
is five years hard labor.

527
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,519
Trial to confirm
this sentence

528
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,313
will be held
at 1700 hours.

529
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,398
Benten Vek.

530
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:30,732
Your fine has been paid,

531
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:33,152
and you'll be free to go
within the hour.

532
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:37,990
Lobo, Horis, Romara,
Pelin, and Gramm.

533
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,950
You are being transferred
to Cardassian authorities

534
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,786
on Bajor for interrogation.

535
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,121
No, no please...

536
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:54,840
Timor, Ishan, Jillur.

537
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,383
You came aboard this station
two days ago

538
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,010
from the Rakantha Province.

539
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,762
Yesterday, you paid a visit
to the chemist's shop

540
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:03,723
and then fell asleep
on the Promenade.

541
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,225
Last night, you were hired
as a cleanup crew

542
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,560
by the Ferengi.

543
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,936
And after you were paid,

544
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,856
you went back
to the Bajoran sector

545
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:13,526
and attempted to murder
Gul Dukat

546
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:15,944
with a chambered plasma grenade.

547
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,695
We were sitting
at a table eating

548
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:19,156
when the grenade went off.

549
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:20,282
There were witnesses.

550
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:22,493
None of which have come forth.

551
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:23,701
Why would the witnesses

552
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:24,662
risk their lives
for three strangers?

553
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:25,954
They're out there,

554
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,998
but you have to go
look for them.

555
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:29,458
THRAX:
Epidermal scans

556
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:31,835
revealed the presence
of trinitrogen chloride

557
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,546
on your hands and clothing.

558
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:37,799
TNC is one of the components
in plasma grenades.

559
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,010
TNC is also
a cleaning solution,

560
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,262
which is what we were
using in Quark's.

561
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,847
Or you used
the opportunity

562
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,182
of working at Quark's

563
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:46,684
to obtain the TNC
in the first place.

564
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:48,644
You all have ties

565
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:50,312
to the Bajoran underground.

566
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:51,605
You have three cousins

567
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:54,149
who are known members
of the resistance.

568
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,776
Five of your friends
are suspected sympathizers.

569
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,696
ODO:
After 50 years
of occupation,

570
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:00,239
is there<i> anyone</i>
left on Bajor

571
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:03,576
who doesn't have some tie
to the resistance?

572
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:05,160
Quiet!

573
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,495
(<i> clamor ceases briefly</i> )

574
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:07,913
That may be true,

575
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:10,165
but you were seen
rushing toward Dukat

576
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,667
after the explosion.

577
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:13,711
Everyone else was running away.

578
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:15,170
I wanted to help my friend.

579
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,672
She was injured
in the blast.

580
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,215
The report of the Cardassian
guards states

581
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:20,676
that you were found
over the body of Gul Dukat

582
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:22,177
attempting to strangle him.

583
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,429
That's a lie.

584
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:25,055
Interrogate
the troops yourself.

585
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:27,558
Don't just take their report
at face value.

586
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:31,687
I don't interrogate members
of the Cardassian military.

587
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:34,565
Then run a ballistic analysis
of the explosion.

588
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:36,983
If you examine the fragmentation
dispersal pattern,

589
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:39,570
you'll find that we couldn't
have thrown the grenade

590
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,280
from our position at the table.

591
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,448
It had to have
come from...

592
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:43,490
Quiet!

593
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,951
Quiet down!

594
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:50,497
There is sufficient evidence
for a conviction.

595
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,332
All of which is circumstantial.

596
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,667
Go beneath the surface.

597
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:56,587
Conduct a<i> real</i> investigation.

598
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:58,213
This investigation is over.

599
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,881
Your case
is going before

600
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,759
a special tribunal
this afternoon.

601
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:03,719
You will be informed
of the sentence

602
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:04,970
just before it meets.

603
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:09,015
No! Wait!
I need to talk to you!

604
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:11,268
Let me talk to you alone
for just a moment!

605
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:13,729
Please! Listen to me!

606
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:16,732
That's enough.

607
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,570
How do you feel?

608
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,781
Better than the last time.

609
00:30:23,781 --> 00:30:25,157
Last time?

610
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:28,243
This is the fourth
assassination attempt

611
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,828
I've survived.

612
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,748
Maybe you should find
another job.

613
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:35,000
(<i> laughing</i> )

614
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,710
Maybe I should.

615
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:40,631
I'm glad to see you
have your appetite back.

616
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:43,883
I don't get to eat
like this very often.

617
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:46,845
I've wanted
to increase rations

618
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:50,182
in the Bajoran sector
for some time now.

619
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:54,311
But the resistance
makes it almost impossible

620
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:57,272
to show any sort of
kindness to your people.

621
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:00,526
You really want to help
my people, don't you?

622
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:02,194
Yes, of course.

623
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:05,489
The Bajorans are...

624
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:08,701
well, they're like
my children, I suppose,

625
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:10,076
and like any father,

626
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:12,705
I want only what's
best for them.

627
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,044
And you still feel that way now

628
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:21,213
after some of your children
have tried to kill you?

629
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:24,174
Bad manners are the
fault of the parent,

630
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:25,258
not the child.

631
00:31:27,845 --> 00:31:30,889
My weakness is I'm too...

632
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,641
generous...

633
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:34,309
too forgiving.

634
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,520
My heart is too big.

635
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,355
(<i> groans</i> )

636
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:42,860
And so is your ego.

637
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,904
"Yes, I know I don't
look Cardassian.

638
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,866
"You see, I was
surgically altered

639
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:50,617
to appear Bajoran."

640
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:54,246
But what if genetic scans
show no Cardassian DNA

641
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,039
in my cellular structure?

642
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,333
In that case,
I'll suggest--

643
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,877
Tell me about Thrax.

644
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:03,589
What do you want to know?

645
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:05,257
Something about his background.

646
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:06,675
He seems unusual.

647
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:08,968
Doesn't have
that casual brutality

648
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:10,596
I've come to expect

649
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:12,556
from Cardassian
security officers.

650
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:14,266
What makes Thrax different?

651
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,644
I wouldn't know.

652
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:20,272
He was gone by the time
I came aboard the station.

653
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,941
Which brings up a good point.

654
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,569
Why is he here now?

655
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:26,862
Garak said that<i> you</i>

656
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:29,448
were the Security Chief
during this time.

657
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:31,991
You're implying that I
should know the answers--

658
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:34,202
that I'm holding
back information?

659
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:39,082
I'm saying that maybe you know
more than you think you do.

660
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:43,002
You lived here, on Terok Nor.

661
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:47,215
You're supposed to be out there
now instead of Thrax.

662
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:48,717
Think, Odo.

663
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,803
There might be some connection

664
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:53,096
between you and what's
happening here.

665
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,848
I don't know.

666
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:56,308
(<i> high-pitched squeal</i> )

667
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,274
Miss me?

668
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:15,577
DAX:
Dukat's personal shuttle
is in Docking Bay 3.

669
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:16,995
What about the station
defense system?

670
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,455
I've got the computer
tied up in knots.

671
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:19,539
I don't think
they'll be able--

672
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:20,624
Halt!

673
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:23,084
(<i> groans</i> )

674
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,086
(<i> grunting</i> )

675
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,588
GARAK:
A changeling?

676
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:09,882
We'll figure that out later.

677
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:14,594
Here it is.

678
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:31,528
We just got the word.

679
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:35,114
Your execution's
been scheduled for 1900.

680
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:36,742
That's two hours from now.

681
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,504
We've got to find
another way out of here.

682
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:50,881
We tried that.

683
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:53,174
Escape doesn't seem
to be the answer.

684
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,551
How could Thrax
be a changeling?

685
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:55,928
In this time period,

686
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:57,054
the Founders didn't know
about the wormhole.

687
00:34:57,054 --> 00:34:58,430
I don't know.

688
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,973
GARAK:
Well, putting aside
the newest

689
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:01,516
shape-shifter in town
for the time being,

690
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,060
how did we end up
back in this cell?

691
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,102
I don't know.

692
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,604
Care to guess?

693
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,480
What makes you think
I have the answer?

694
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,899
You've been
acting strangely

695
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:11,777
ever since we first woke up
on the Promenade.

696
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:13,361
Continually distracted,
depressed, and agitated.

697
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,654
And you knew
the names

698
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,155
of the people we're
supposed to be.

699
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,866
You knew the details
of the case

700
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:18,992
like you were there.

701
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:20,285
But you couldn't
have been there

702
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:21,369
because it happened
before you came

703
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,704
aboard the station.

704
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:26,124
Everything seems
to lead back to you,

705
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,250
and I want
to know why.

706
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,794
THRAX:
You said you wanted

707
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:30,087
to see me?

708
00:35:30,087 --> 00:35:32,047
Yes. It's urgent.

709
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:45,268
I'm listening,
but I don't have much time.

710
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:48,354
You are about to make
a very serious mistake.

711
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:49,439
Because you're innocent,
of course.

712
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:50,732
All of you.

713
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:52,609
That's right,
and I can prove it.

714
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:54,611
Compare this attack to
recent bombings on Bajor.

715
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:56,237
You'll find a similarity

716
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,239
to four incidents
in Musilla Province,

717
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,700
none of which
we could have done.

718
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,201
This proves nothing.

719
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,996
And under Cardassian law,

720
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:06,331
the accused
must prove his innocence.

721
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:09,084
Since the evidence in this case
is sufficient

722
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:10,418
to warrant conviction,

723
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,087
the investigation is over.

724
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:16,008
Your job is to find the truth,

725
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:19,218
not obtain convictions.

726
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:21,346
Truth.

727
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:23,264
You want the truth?

728
00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:26,309
All right, the truth is

729
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,520
that none of you
would be accused--

730
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,313
none of you would even be here--

731
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:33,399
if the Bajorans weren't fighting
the Cardassians.

732
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:34,776
It's futile.

733
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:36,945
The occupation
has lasted for 50 years,

734
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:38,989
and it will probably last
another 50.

735
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:41,116
I wouldn't be too
sure about that.

736
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:43,910
Why not just accept it?!

737
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:47,914
If the Bajoran people would
accept their place in history,

738
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,916
none of this would be happening.

739
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:53,879
We are talking about
the attempt on Gul Dukat's life,

740
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:57,549
not the socio-political
ramifications of the resistance.

741
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:59,176
It's all part
of the same problem!

742
00:36:59,176 --> 00:37:04,263
When your people resort
to terrorism and violence,

743
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:08,185
they're fighting against order,
against stability,

744
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:11,938
against the rule of law--
and this must be stopped.

745
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:18,611
There is more to life
than the rule of law.

746
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:21,781
It has been my observation

747
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:25,326
that only the guilty
make that kind of statement.

748
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,871
(<i> groaning</i> )

749
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:33,168
I didn't want to tell you this--

750
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:35,879
I don't know what
the consequences will be--

751
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:38,924
but we are<i> not</i> terrorists.

752
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:40,884
We're not even Bajorans.

753
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:42,928
There's been a temporal
displacement of some kind.

754
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:45,222
We don't belong in this time.

755
00:37:45,222 --> 00:37:47,807
We're from the future.

756
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,267
I know.

757
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,894
You know?

758
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:53,688
Then what are you going
to do about it?

759
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,523
What I am supposed to do.

760
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:59,027
Nothing more, nothing less.

761
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:02,822
The question is:

762
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:05,075
What are<i> you</i> going to do...

763
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,036
Odo?

764
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,458
(<i> gasps</i> )

765
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:26,263
THRAX:
It's too late for them now.

766
00:38:26,263 --> 00:38:28,098
It's out of my hands.

767
00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:30,058
Why aren't I with them?

768
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:32,685
There were only
three terrorists, Odo.

769
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,020
You know that.

770
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,106
This is the price
for taking up arms

771
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:37,565
against those who
would protect you...

772
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:41,486
who have only your best
interests at heart.

773
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:43,029
They haven't done anything.

774
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,363
They don't belong here.

775
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:46,283
It's already
happened, Odo.

776
00:38:46,283 --> 00:38:47,533
But this isn't what happened.

777
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,161
It wasn't these people.

778
00:38:49,161 --> 00:38:50,912
Proceed
with the execution.

779
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:54,082
ODO:
No.

780
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:56,501
I'm not going to let this
happen again.

781
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:58,253
Not again!

782
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:00,046
(<i> grunting</i> )

783
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,506
You can't execute them.

784
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,133
You don't even belong here.

785
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:04,968
I do.

786
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:12,934
(<i> disrupter firing</i> )

787
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:38,417
Constable?

788
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:41,338
That's exactly how it happened
seven years ago.

789
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:45,175
It was you all along.

790
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:48,511
Yes.

791
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:55,143
I was Chief of Security
on the Promenade.

792
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:59,231
<i>I</i> was the one
who charged those men

793
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:01,358
with a crime
they didn't commit,

794
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:02,859
and<i> I</i> was the one

795
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:05,737
who turned them over
to Dukat.

796
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:07,446
Three days after the executions,

797
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:09,241
there was another bombing
on the Promenade

798
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:11,868
identical to the one
that almost killed Dukat.

799
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:18,833
Timor, Ishan, and Jillur
were innocent.

800
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,919
All the evidence
was there--

801
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:24,214
the inconsistencies
in the reports

802
00:40:24,214 --> 00:40:26,383
of the soldiers
who arrested them,

803
00:40:26,383 --> 00:40:30,387
a pattern of bombings,
the ballistics--

804
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:33,639
it was all there
from the beginning.

805
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,311
But I was too busy,

806
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:42,607
too concerned
with maintaining order

807
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:45,026
and the rule of law.

808
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,488
I thought of myself
as the outsider,

809
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:52,742
the shape-shifter
who cared for nothing

810
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:53,868
but justice.

811
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,536
It never occurred
to me that I

812
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:58,664
could fail, but I did,
and I never wanted anyone

813
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:00,708
to know the truth--

814
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,838
that seven years ago,

815
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:10,593
I allowed three innocent men
to die.

816
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,478
(<i> ragged breathing</i> )

817
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,729
BASHIR:
<i>Constable?</i>

818
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,940
(<i> gasps</i> )

819
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,858
Whatever it is
you've been through

820
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:27,026
has taken its toll.

821
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:45,170
Far as I can tell,
the four of you were locked

822
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,088
into some version
of the Great Link.

823
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,258
The Link?

824
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:52,593
How is that possible?

825
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,512
I'm a solid now.

826
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:57,223
Well, it seems you're not
as solid as you think.

827
00:41:57,223 --> 00:42:00,143
When I ran a neurochemical
scan of your brain,

828
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:02,812
I found residual traces
of morphogenic enzymes,

829
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:05,440
which I've only detected before
in changelings.

830
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,566
When the plasma storm
hit the runabout,

831
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:09,068
it activated the enzymes

832
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,904
and initiated
a telepathic response.

833
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:13,490
Your mind reached out
to find other changelings

834
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:15,074
to form the Link,

835
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:18,119
but all it could find
were Sisko, Dax, and Garak.

836
00:42:19,496 --> 00:42:21,164
And just before the accident,

837
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:24,000
I was thinking
about the executions.

838
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,296
Somehow, being in the Link
must've forced me to relive it

839
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:31,966
and admit the truth
about what I'd done.

840
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:35,136
It would make
a fascinating paper.

841
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:38,097
Although,
I don't intend to write one.

842
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,438
If you have
any questions,

843
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:47,899
uh, you know where to find me.

844
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:53,988
(<i> sighing</i> )

845
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:59,785
When I first read your report...

846
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:02,414
I didn't know what to think.

847
00:43:02,414 --> 00:43:04,665
So I said to myself,
"That's all right, Nerys.

848
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:05,958
"You're stunned.

849
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,961
You need to let it
sink in a little."

850
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:13,132
But it's been two days, Odo.

851
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:17,178
I still don't know
what to think.

852
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:21,433
I'm guilty.

853
00:43:21,433 --> 00:43:23,476
What more is there to say?

854
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:25,019
Maybe nothing.

855
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:28,022
Maybe a lot.

856
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,691
I believed in you.

857
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:31,692
A lot of people did.

858
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:32,693
You were special.

859
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:33,903
You were the one man

860
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:35,988
who stood apart
from everyone else...

861
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:37,949
the one man who stood
for justice.

862
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,033
Now what?

863
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,121
Now I'm...

864
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:45,081
just another...

865
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:47,625
imperfect solid.

866
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:51,045
Okay.

867
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:54,090
The Prophets know
I'm not perfect.

868
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:57,135
I guess the truth is

869
00:43:57,135 --> 00:44:00,179
that anyone who lived through
the occupation

870
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,848
had to get a little dirty.

871
00:44:04,434 --> 00:44:06,227
But I need to know

872
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:10,523
that no other innocent people
died on your watch, Odo.

873
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:13,359
That this was the only time.

874
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,449
I'm not sure.

875
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,911
I hope so.
