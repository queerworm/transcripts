1
00:00:06,241 --> 00:00:08,303
If I'd known
what I was walking into

2
00:00:08,346 --> 00:00:09,872
I never would have gone.

3
00:00:09,917 --> 00:00:12,013
It was your idea
to attend the conference

4
00:00:12,056 --> 00:00:13,457
in the first place, Garak.

5
00:00:13,494 --> 00:00:15,966
I thought the Bajorans
would be grateful

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,526
to hear someone provide them

7
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,541
with an opposing
philosophical view.

8
00:00:19,575 --> 00:00:21,205
Opposing view?

9
00:00:21,247 --> 00:00:22,682
Garak, you were trying

10
00:00:22,717 --> 00:00:25,555
to defend the military
occupation of their world.

11
00:00:25,591 --> 00:00:27,995
How grateful did you think
they would be?

12
00:00:28,031 --> 00:00:30,002
My understanding
of this conference was

13
00:00:30,036 --> 00:00:33,067
that it was supposed to be
an examination of the occupation

14
00:00:33,111 --> 00:00:35,583
from a dispassionate,
historical perspective.

15
00:00:35,617 --> 00:00:37,781
Instead, everyone went
out of their way

16
00:00:37,823 --> 00:00:40,625
to dismiss virtually everything
I had to say.

17
00:00:40,664 --> 00:00:43,193
I thought the Bajorans
bent over backwards

18
00:00:43,237 --> 00:00:44,901
to be polite to you, Garak.

19
00:00:44,942 --> 00:00:46,913
Giving me a name tag that read

20
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:49,442
"Elim Garak...
Former Cardassian Oppressor"

21
00:00:49,487 --> 00:00:50,979
was hardly polite.

22
00:00:51,024 --> 00:00:54,226
And what did you want it to say?
"Former Spy"?

23
00:00:54,266 --> 00:00:55,530
What I would have liked

24
00:00:55,569 --> 00:00:57,472
was less posturing
and more debate.

25
00:00:57,508 --> 00:00:59,536
It's clear to me now
that the Bajorans

26
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:00,912
aren't really interested

27
00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:03,251
in discovering
historical truth

28
00:01:03,322 --> 00:01:05,259
as much as they are in promoting

29
00:01:05,294 --> 00:01:07,858
the myths and legends
of the "glorious resistance."

30
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,838
Well, Odo wasn't a member
of the resistance

31
00:01:09,873 --> 00:01:13,645
and he managed to attract
a fair amount of attention.

32
00:01:13,683 --> 00:01:14,947
Yes.

33
00:01:14,986 --> 00:01:17,892
It seems you have
quite a fan club on Bajor.

34
00:01:17,927 --> 00:01:18,918
I half-expected you

35
00:01:18,963 --> 00:01:20,661
to be signing
autographs at the end.

36
00:01:20,701 --> 00:01:21,897
Don't let him get to you, Odo.

37
00:01:21,938 --> 00:01:23,305
You should be proud
of what you did

38
00:01:23,341 --> 00:01:24,401
during the occupation.

39
00:01:24,444 --> 00:01:26,244
I've nothing to be proud of.

40
00:01:26,282 --> 00:01:29,016
I tried to bring order
to a chaotic situation.

41
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:30,548
That's all.

42
00:01:30,594 --> 00:01:32,588
You need to give yourself
more credit, Constable.

43
00:01:32,632 --> 00:01:34,500
Keeping order
during the occupation

44
00:01:34,537 --> 00:01:37,568
would be a tough job for anyone,
but you not only did it

45
00:01:37,612 --> 00:01:40,814
you did it by earning
the trust of both sides.

46
00:01:40,853 --> 00:01:42,881
What was it the moderator said?

47
00:01:42,925 --> 00:01:45,295
That "you may have worked
for the Cardassians

48
00:01:45,331 --> 00:01:48,533
but your only master...
was justice."

49
00:01:48,573 --> 00:01:50,271
And a legend is born.

50
00:01:58,432 --> 00:02:01,531
Sir? Captain Sisko's runabout
is approaching the station.

51
00:02:01,574 --> 00:02:03,009
Very well.

52
00:02:03,045 --> 00:02:05,347
Clear them for docking
on Landing Pad 1.

53
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,441
Aye, sir.

54
00:02:07,489 --> 00:02:09,153
Commander, something's wrong.

55
00:02:09,193 --> 00:02:11,357
They're not responding...
and sensors show

56
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:13,461
unusual EM signatures
along their hull.

57
00:02:13,504 --> 00:02:15,772
The runabout's on autopilot.

58
00:02:15,811 --> 00:02:16,802
Life signs?

59
00:02:16,847 --> 00:02:17,975
Four.

60
00:02:18,016 --> 00:02:20,386
Very weak.

61
00:02:20,456 --> 00:02:21,891
Disengage the autopilot.

62
00:02:21,927 --> 00:02:23,659
Bring the runabout
to within transporter range.

63
00:02:23,698 --> 00:02:25,328
Doctor Bashir
to Transporter Room 5.

64
00:02:25,369 --> 00:02:26,861
Medical emergency.

65
00:02:36,932 --> 00:02:39,166
Check the aft compartment.

66
00:02:42,947 --> 00:02:45,749
He's alive, but there's
an excess of neural energy

67
00:02:45,789 --> 00:02:47,190
in his cerebral cortex.

68
00:02:47,225 --> 00:02:48,694
What does that mean?

69
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,165
I'm not sure of that.

70
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,567
Can you revive them?

71
00:02:51,603 --> 00:02:53,471
I'm not sure of that, either.

72
00:03:11,822 --> 00:03:15,491
All prisoners
return to your quarters.

73
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:35,499
Show some dignity.

74
00:05:35,572 --> 00:05:37,064
Look at you.

75
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,378
No wonder the Cardassians
think we're animals.

76
00:05:40,651 --> 00:05:42,052
Get up.

77
00:05:42,088 --> 00:05:43,523
Get up!

78
00:05:43,626 --> 00:05:46,691
If you're going to spend
the night taking chemicals

79
00:05:46,734 --> 00:05:48,432
stay off the Promenade.

80
00:05:48,472 --> 00:05:50,375
We don't need
another cleansing today.

81
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:55,950
What happened?

82
00:05:55,992 --> 00:05:57,154
Not here.

83
00:05:57,195 --> 00:05:59,063
I couldn't agree more.

84
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,730
All bio-organic material

85
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:05,511
must be disposed of
according to regulations.

86
00:06:12,542 --> 00:06:15,014
There's a high level
of neural activity

87
00:06:15,048 --> 00:06:17,110
which suggests that their
conscious minds are still active

88
00:06:17,154 --> 00:06:21,221
and yet, there's no response
to external stimuli.

89
00:06:21,265 --> 00:06:23,236
What's the word on the runabout?

90
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,036
We have found
preliminary indications

91
00:06:25,074 --> 00:06:27,410
that the ship encountered
a class-2 plasma storm

92
00:06:27,447 --> 00:06:28,848
which irradiated the vessel.

93
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:32,519
Computer,
are the neural readings

94
00:06:32,561 --> 00:06:35,797
for subjects Odo, Sisko,
Dax and Garak

95
00:06:35,836 --> 00:06:37,500
consistent with the effects

96
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,910
of encountering
a class-2 plasma storm?

97
00:06:39,947 --> 00:06:41,246
There are no recorded

98
00:06:41,283 --> 00:06:43,619
causal relationships
between plasma storms

99
00:06:43,656 --> 00:06:45,320
and specified neural readings.

100
00:06:45,394 --> 00:06:46,658
None.

101
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:50,606
Computer, how many
medical records are there

102
00:06:50,641 --> 00:06:52,840
on space plasma phenomena?

103
00:06:52,881 --> 00:06:55,353
Five thousand twenty-one.

104
00:06:55,454 --> 00:06:58,154
Well, it would appear
that a common phenomena

105
00:06:58,194 --> 00:07:00,689
has had an uncommon
effect on our people.

106
00:07:00,734 --> 00:07:02,500
Well, the runabout
is still being analyzed.

107
00:07:02,538 --> 00:07:04,064
We should have
more information soon.

108
00:07:04,109 --> 00:07:07,515
Good. In the meantime,
I have some reading to do.

109
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,920
This is Terok Nor...
DS9 during the occupation.

110
00:07:21,956 --> 00:07:23,289
Time travel?

111
00:07:23,326 --> 00:07:24,818
Uh, no, it's more than that.

112
00:07:24,863 --> 00:07:26,264
Our clothes have changed.

113
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,294
Could we be in a holosuite?

114
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:30,242
Computer, end program.

115
00:07:31,447 --> 00:07:34,113
Let's assume that's
a "no" for the moment.

116
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:37,890
Benjamin, we're not
attracting any attention.

117
00:07:37,931 --> 00:07:39,332
And we should be.

118
00:07:39,368 --> 00:07:42,365
Humans, Trills and changelings
didn't just stroll

119
00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:44,209
through Terok Nor unnoticed.

120
00:07:44,247 --> 00:07:46,411
Well, then I should be getting
some attention as well.

121
00:07:46,486 --> 00:07:48,582
We are in the Bajoran sector

122
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,562
and Cardassians
weren't exactly welcome here.

123
00:07:50,597 --> 00:07:52,568
I don't think they see you
as a Cardassian.

124
00:07:52,602 --> 00:07:55,234
I'm beginning to think
they don't see any of us

125
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,143
as who we really are.

126
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,706
The clothes we're wearing
are Bajoran.

127
00:07:58,751 --> 00:08:00,118
They're treating us
like Bajorans.

128
00:08:00,155 --> 00:08:01,488
Maybe they see us as Bajorans.

129
00:08:01,525 --> 00:08:02,824
Any theories, old man?

130
00:08:02,861 --> 00:08:05,163
Some kind
of cross-dimensional transfer?

131
00:08:05,201 --> 00:08:07,263
Our conscious minds
might have been moved

132
00:08:07,306 --> 00:08:08,502
through time and space

133
00:08:08,543 --> 00:08:11,311
into the bodies
of four Bajorans on Terok Nor.

134
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,982
But then why are we
still seeing each other

135
00:08:14,024 --> 00:08:16,553
as we really are,
instead of as Bajorans?

136
00:08:19,003 --> 00:08:21,305
I just ran out of speculation.

137
00:08:21,343 --> 00:08:23,337
The last thing I remember

138
00:08:23,381 --> 00:08:25,318
was sitting in the runabout.

139
00:08:25,353 --> 00:08:27,689
There was a plasma anomaly
on the sensors

140
00:08:27,726 --> 00:08:29,925
and then there was this sound.

141
00:08:29,966 --> 00:08:31,299
No, not a sound.

142
00:08:31,336 --> 00:08:33,330
More like a strong vibration.

143
00:08:33,374 --> 00:08:34,707
Hmm. I remember.

144
00:08:34,744 --> 00:08:35,872
Odo?

145
00:08:35,914 --> 00:08:38,182
I don't recall.

146
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,194
But whatever's happened,
we have to leave this place...

147
00:08:41,228 --> 00:08:42,892
get off the station.

148
00:08:42,932 --> 00:08:45,496
Then I suggest we go
directly to the authorities

149
00:08:45,606 --> 00:08:46,870
and explain our situation.

150
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:47,879
Garak.

151
00:08:47,912 --> 00:08:48,903
I have knowledge

152
00:08:48,948 --> 00:08:51,078
of certain... security codes

153
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,284
that would be sufficient
to prove that I am

154
00:08:53,326 --> 00:08:57,325
in fact, a Cardassian, even
if their eyes say otherwise.

155
00:08:57,369 --> 00:09:00,171
I could always say that I'm
an undercover operative

156
00:09:00,211 --> 00:09:01,407
posing as a Bajoran...

157
00:09:01,447 --> 00:09:03,145
Captain, the authorities
on Terok Nor

158
00:09:03,185 --> 00:09:05,213
will not be looking
for reasons to help us.

159
00:09:05,257 --> 00:09:08,629
They will be looking
for a reason to interrogate us

160
00:09:08,665 --> 00:09:10,727
and believe me, you do not want

161
00:09:10,771 --> 00:09:13,266
to be interrogated
by the Cardassians.

162
00:09:13,311 --> 00:09:15,339
I tend to agree
with the Constable.

163
00:09:15,383 --> 00:09:16,818
If they should discover

164
00:09:16,854 --> 00:09:18,187
that we are actually
from the future...

165
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,557
Gul Dukat's on the second level.

166
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:26,308
Let's move on.

167
00:09:55,655 --> 00:09:57,489
Odo?

168
00:10:05,681 --> 00:10:06,911
Who was that?

169
00:10:06,951 --> 00:10:08,181
I don't know.

170
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:09,451
Well, you should.

171
00:10:09,491 --> 00:10:10,653
It was your predecessor.

172
00:10:10,727 --> 00:10:12,026
My predecessor?!

173
00:10:13,066 --> 00:10:14,934
Oh... yes.

174
00:10:14,971 --> 00:10:17,671
The man talking to Dukat.

175
00:10:17,745 --> 00:10:19,078
His name is Thrax.

176
00:10:19,115 --> 00:10:22,682
He was in charge of security
on the Promenade before me.

177
00:10:22,758 --> 00:10:26,791
That means we've gone back
at least nine years.

178
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,465
You.

179
00:10:28,506 --> 00:10:29,702
Come with us.

180
00:10:29,743 --> 00:10:31,007
What's she done?!

181
00:10:31,046 --> 00:10:33,416
Nothing... yet.

182
00:10:33,453 --> 00:10:35,652
Perhaps there's been
some misunderstanding.

183
00:10:35,691 --> 00:10:36,717
If I may be so bold

184
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,529
you may find something
which will

185
00:10:39,569 --> 00:10:41,437
bring you infinitely
more profit

186
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,742
than the arrest
of a Bajoran woman.

187
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:45,545
Latinum?

188
00:10:45,584 --> 00:10:47,248
Two strips.

189
00:10:47,288 --> 00:10:48,518
Where is it?

190
00:10:48,558 --> 00:10:51,589
Ah, but our friend is
still in your custody.

191
00:10:58,251 --> 00:10:59,811
Don't move!

192
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,594
Tempting offer.

193
00:11:04,634 --> 00:11:06,468
Maybe next time.

194
00:11:06,505 --> 00:11:08,271
This one's been selected.

195
00:11:09,312 --> 00:11:10,942
I'll be all right.

196
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:18,996
Ooh.

197
00:11:22,981 --> 00:11:24,645
Doctor.

198
00:11:42,374 --> 00:11:45,348
Garak's septial capillaries
burst at this point.

199
00:11:45,382 --> 00:11:47,216
The pattern of his delta waves

200
00:11:47,254 --> 00:11:50,126
show some unusual activity
at the same moment.

201
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:52,895
The bleeding might be the result

202
00:11:52,935 --> 00:11:56,273
of some kind
of psychosomatic response.

203
00:11:56,344 --> 00:11:59,146
You mean, he thought
he was injured.

204
00:12:00,755 --> 00:12:02,054
Well, under certain conditions

205
00:12:02,093 --> 00:12:04,327
people have been known
to alter their blood pressure

206
00:12:04,365 --> 00:12:05,698
lower their body temperature...

207
00:12:05,735 --> 00:12:06,863
even manifest a tumor

208
00:12:06,904 --> 00:12:08,499
as a result
of psychological stimuli.

209
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:12,609
Could these stimuli
cause more serious injuries?

210
00:12:12,652 --> 00:12:15,524
I don't think he could
spontaneously break a bone

211
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,724
but he could certainly
stop his heart

212
00:12:17,767 --> 00:12:20,205
or break a key blood vessel
in his brain.

213
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,971
But what is causing all of this?

214
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,642
At the risk of repeating myself

215
00:12:24,684 --> 00:12:25,812
I just don't know.

216
00:12:32,504 --> 00:12:34,441
Step back from the gate.

217
00:12:41,562 --> 00:12:44,000
He said, "She's been selected."

218
00:12:44,035 --> 00:12:45,334
What the hell does that mean?

219
00:12:45,371 --> 00:12:47,843
Random interrogation,
forced labor relocation...

220
00:12:47,878 --> 00:12:49,006
it could be anything.

221
00:12:49,048 --> 00:12:50,017
That's not good enough.

222
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,349
I want to know
where they've taken her.

223
00:12:51,386 --> 00:12:53,585
But before we can
help Commander Dax

224
00:12:53,626 --> 00:12:56,566
we need to find out
who we are in this reality.

225
00:12:56,601 --> 00:12:58,070
If we could get
to a computer terminal

226
00:12:58,104 --> 00:12:59,471
we could ask
for a simple ID scan.

227
00:12:59,508 --> 00:13:02,778
Computer access was extremely
limited on Terok Nor.

228
00:13:02,817 --> 00:13:05,655
What about
a Cardassian comp-link?

229
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,681
Ha.

230
00:13:13,545 --> 00:13:15,709
I took the liberty
of borrowing this

231
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,878
from the gentlemen

232
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,256
who thought my nose
needed adjustment.

233
00:13:19,293 --> 00:13:22,358
I see I'm going to have
to add the word "pickpocket"

234
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:23,461
to your resume.

235
00:13:23,504 --> 00:13:24,973
It's only a hobby.

236
00:13:25,007 --> 00:13:26,306
Interesting

237
00:13:26,344 --> 00:13:28,839
that a simple tailor
should just happen

238
00:13:28,884 --> 00:13:31,118
to have
a high-level security code.

239
00:13:31,157 --> 00:13:32,126
Yes, isn't it?

240
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:34,563
And if my nose
didn't hurt so much

241
00:13:34,599 --> 00:13:39,066
I'd tell you a fascinating story
about how I came to possess it.

242
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,409
Ah, yes.

243
00:13:40,448 --> 00:13:44,151
Captain, you are actually
a Bajoran electronics engineer.

244
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:46,425
You're 38 years old,
you have no criminal record

245
00:13:46,496 --> 00:13:49,230
your family resides
in Rakantha Province

246
00:13:49,271 --> 00:13:51,971
and your name is Ishan Chaye.

247
00:13:53,915 --> 00:13:55,111
Hmm. Lucky me.

248
00:13:55,152 --> 00:13:57,180
I'm an artist.

249
00:13:57,224 --> 00:13:58,557
I'm 55,
I've been arrested

250
00:13:58,595 --> 00:14:00,657
three times
for disturbing the peace...

251
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,671
I must be incorrigible.

252
00:14:02,705 --> 00:14:04,505
I also reside in Rakantha

253
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:08,076
and my name is Jillur Gueta.

254
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:09,349
And the Constable?

255
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:10,722
Ah, yes.

256
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:11,989
His profession is...

257
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:13,089
I'm a bookkeeper.

258
00:14:14,134 --> 00:14:16,037
46 years old.

259
00:14:16,074 --> 00:14:20,177
I have a wife and two sons
in Rakantha Province

260
00:14:20,217 --> 00:14:22,587
and my name is Timor Landi.

261
00:14:22,623 --> 00:14:23,785
That's right.

262
00:14:23,827 --> 00:14:25,627
How'd you know that?

263
00:14:27,102 --> 00:14:29,232
Odo?

264
00:14:29,274 --> 00:14:32,476
Congratulations, gentlemen.

265
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,417
You get to work today...

266
00:14:34,454 --> 00:14:37,656
and you'll be laboring
in the finest establishment

267
00:14:37,696 --> 00:14:39,131
on the station...

268
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,499
my establishment.

269
00:14:40,537 --> 00:14:44,640
12 hours of work,
two five-minute breaks...

270
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,882
one slip of latinum each.

271
00:14:47,922 --> 00:14:50,086
Let's go.

272
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,270
Didn't you hear me?

273
00:14:54,306 --> 00:14:56,744
I'm offering you work.

274
00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:58,716
What are you waiting for?

275
00:14:58,751 --> 00:15:00,050
N-nothing.

276
00:15:00,087 --> 00:15:01,955
Just show us the way.

277
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,393
Open it.

278
00:15:09,445 --> 00:15:11,644
Start by stepping
through the gate

279
00:15:11,684 --> 00:15:14,213
that the nice man
has opened for you.

280
00:15:19,805 --> 00:15:21,297
Very good.

281
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:24,043
You three must be
warp engineers.

282
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:28,550
Now, we're going to walk down
the Promenade to the bar.

283
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,862
Would you like me
to hold your hands

284
00:15:30,901 --> 00:15:32,268
or can you manage it?

285
00:15:32,304 --> 00:15:34,468
We'll manage.

286
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,945
I'm so glad.

287
00:15:37,952 --> 00:15:39,980
How much damage would it do
to the timeline

288
00:15:40,025 --> 00:15:43,592
if Quark were to suffer
a mysterious... accident?

289
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:45,170
I'm not sure, but maybe

290
00:15:45,204 --> 00:15:47,699
we should conduct
a little experiment

291
00:15:47,744 --> 00:15:49,738
and find out.

292
00:15:59,508 --> 00:16:01,103
Name?

293
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,342
Leeta.

294
00:16:04,388 --> 00:16:07,556
Look at me when I speak
to you, Leeta.

295
00:16:12,843 --> 00:16:14,335
She'll do.

296
00:16:21,332 --> 00:16:23,326
<i>Kanar.</i>

297
00:16:34,398 --> 00:16:36,096
For two.

298
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:47,800
Have you ever had <i>kanar?</i>

299
00:16:47,834 --> 00:16:49,668
No.

300
00:16:49,705 --> 00:16:51,403
Well, then this is an occasion.

301
00:16:54,183 --> 00:16:55,778
You're trembling.

302
00:17:01,903 --> 00:17:08,341
Despite what you may have heard,
I'm a fair man, Leeta.

303
00:17:08,387 --> 00:17:09,982
Rest assured

304
00:17:10,024 --> 00:17:12,428
you have nothing to fear
from me.

305
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:15,302
I did not bring you here
to be abused.

306
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:16,968
Then why am I here?

307
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:27,091
It may surprise you
to hear this

308
00:17:27,136 --> 00:17:30,737
but my position is a lonely one.

309
00:17:30,846 --> 00:17:36,259
I'm isolated from the people
who live under my protection.

310
00:17:36,292 --> 00:17:38,992
I require someone...

311
00:17:39,033 --> 00:17:40,468
to talk with.

312
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:44,040
In short...

313
00:17:46,051 --> 00:17:47,783
a friend.

314
00:17:48,858 --> 00:17:50,795
You want me to be your friend?

315
00:17:50,864 --> 00:17:52,390
Ironic, isn't it?

316
00:17:52,434 --> 00:17:56,137
That I should choose
a simple Bajoran girl

317
00:17:56,177 --> 00:17:59,379
to share
my inner thoughts with.

318
00:18:01,725 --> 00:18:04,722
But as you get to know me,
Leeta...

319
00:18:05,903 --> 00:18:08,569
I think you'll find
that I'm a...

320
00:18:10,181 --> 00:18:12,118
complicated man.

321
00:18:13,489 --> 00:18:15,688
You're different
than I imagined.

322
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,502
To the beginning

323
00:18:19,538 --> 00:18:22,010
of your education.

324
00:18:44,804 --> 00:18:47,835
I never knew
we were such messy conquerors.

325
00:18:47,879 --> 00:18:49,679
I remember the occupation

326
00:18:49,717 --> 00:18:52,212
being a little more tidy
than this.

327
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:53,317
Everything is tidy

328
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:55,455
when someone else
is doing the cleaning.

329
00:18:55,498 --> 00:18:57,902
The Bajorans
were much more suited

330
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:00,273
for this sort of thing
than we were.

331
00:19:00,311 --> 00:19:02,407
Servile work is in their nature.

332
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:05,570
I'll remember to mention that
to Major Kira when we get back.

333
00:19:05,703 --> 00:19:08,471
There are exceptions
to every rule.

334
00:19:26,825 --> 00:19:28,351
You all right?

335
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:32,731
The smell is making me sick.

336
00:19:32,773 --> 00:19:34,573
Oh.

337
00:19:34,611 --> 00:19:35,705
How did you know

338
00:19:35,748 --> 00:19:38,448
your name would be Timor Landi
in this...

339
00:19:38,489 --> 00:19:40,289
this whatever this is.

340
00:19:40,327 --> 00:19:43,165
I recognized the other two names

341
00:19:43,201 --> 00:19:47,702
from the security files
kept during the occupation.

342
00:19:47,746 --> 00:19:51,483
Timor, Ishan and Jillur
were the names of three Bajorans

343
00:19:51,589 --> 00:19:54,586
who were accused of attempting
to assassinate

344
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,102
Gul Dukat on the Promenade.

345
00:19:58,373 --> 00:20:00,937
Half the resistance
tried to kill Dukat.

346
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,076
These three were innocent.

347
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:06,093
However, no one knew that
at the time

348
00:20:06,127 --> 00:20:09,158
and Dukat wanted
to make an example of them.

349
00:20:09,202 --> 00:20:11,264
So he had them led
out onto the Promenade

350
00:20:11,307 --> 00:20:14,942
and publicly... executed.

351
00:20:16,253 --> 00:20:17,848
If we're them...

352
00:20:17,891 --> 00:20:20,227
If we're them,
we better find a way out of here

353
00:20:20,263 --> 00:20:22,758
before Dukat makes an example
out of us.

354
00:20:31,827 --> 00:20:35,599
Quark,
I understand you had a visit

355
00:20:35,704 --> 00:20:38,336
from a Talavian freighter
captain this morning...

356
00:20:38,377 --> 00:20:41,283
a Captain Livara, I believe.

357
00:20:41,318 --> 00:20:43,289
I had a lot of visitors
this morning.

358
00:20:43,323 --> 00:20:44,953
It was a busy day.

359
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:47,627
I'm surprised
you're being so indiscreet.

360
00:20:47,668 --> 00:20:50,038
Captain Livara
is a known smuggler.

361
00:20:50,074 --> 00:20:51,304
You don't say?

362
00:20:51,344 --> 00:20:53,816
Such a nice, friendly man, too.

363
00:20:53,851 --> 00:20:54,945
I guess you never can tell

364
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,422
what some people
are really like.

365
00:20:58,229 --> 00:21:01,727
Rumor has it that
the Obsidian Order has had him

366
00:21:01,772 --> 00:21:03,298
under surveillance
for several months.

367
00:21:03,342 --> 00:21:05,404
The Obsidian Order?

368
00:21:05,447 --> 00:21:07,350
Rumor also has it
that they're bringing in

369
00:21:07,386 --> 00:21:10,884
all of Livara's
coconspirators for...

370
00:21:10,928 --> 00:21:12,626
questioning.

371
00:21:12,733 --> 00:21:16,003
Well, you know how rumors are.

372
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:19,447
Yes.
They're usually true.

373
00:21:19,484 --> 00:21:24,053
So, when the Order
asks me for a list

374
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:26,295
of all of Livara's
known associates

375
00:21:26,335 --> 00:21:27,497
on board the station...

376
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:28,939
He was here for ten minutes.

377
00:21:28,975 --> 00:21:30,171
He wanted

378
00:21:30,212 --> 00:21:32,684
to unload a shipment
of <i>maraji</i> crystals

379
00:21:32,785 --> 00:21:34,585
but I wasn't interested.

380
00:21:35,826 --> 00:21:37,660
I can't move <i>maraji</i> crystals.

381
00:21:37,698 --> 00:21:41,572
The Cardassians don't like them

382
00:21:41,608 --> 00:21:46,713
and the Bajorans can't afford
them, so I sent him on his way.

383
00:21:46,754 --> 00:21:48,018
All right?

384
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:50,223
And that's all?

385
00:21:50,264 --> 00:21:51,756
That's all.

386
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,737
I hope so...

387
00:21:54,775 --> 00:21:56,142
because if I find out

388
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,086
that you've been dealing
in illegal crystals

389
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,926
I'll hand you over
to the Order myself.

390
00:22:04,901 --> 00:22:06,963
Always a pleasure.

391
00:22:12,455 --> 00:22:14,893
I see you're not
the first man around here

392
00:22:14,927 --> 00:22:16,419
to keep Quark on his toes.

393
00:22:16,465 --> 00:22:17,593
Yes.

394
00:22:17,635 --> 00:22:18,695
Something's wrong.

395
00:22:18,738 --> 00:22:20,902
Thrax talked
about a Captain Livara.

396
00:22:20,943 --> 00:22:23,177
Does that name
mean something to you?

397
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:25,450
Livara wasn't just
another smuggler.

398
00:22:25,488 --> 00:22:26,752
He was a Romulan spy

399
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:28,591
and didn't begin
working in this sector

400
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:29,963
until seven years ago

401
00:22:30,001 --> 00:22:33,636
but seven years ago,
Thrax wasn't on Terok Nor.

402
00:22:33,676 --> 00:22:35,202
You were, Odo.

403
00:22:35,247 --> 00:22:37,515
Odd contradiction.

404
00:22:37,554 --> 00:22:39,218
So I checked the date.

405
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:41,125
This is seven years ago.

406
00:22:41,162 --> 00:22:43,030
Thrax shouldn't be here.

407
00:22:43,067 --> 00:22:45,562
You should be
the Security Chief.

408
00:22:45,607 --> 00:22:47,943
None of this
makes any sense, Garak.

409
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:51,820
Now, I suggest we concentrate
on finding a way out of here.

410
00:22:51,891 --> 00:22:53,190
That's our priority.

411
00:22:53,228 --> 00:22:55,131
I tend to agree.

412
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:57,296
Well, you'll get
no argument from me...

413
00:22:57,338 --> 00:22:58,602
but how?

414
00:22:58,641 --> 00:23:01,239
We need to contact
the Bajoran resistance.

415
00:23:01,282 --> 00:23:04,120
They might be able
to get us off the station.

416
00:23:04,155 --> 00:23:05,955
Maybe even to the Federation.

417
00:23:05,994 --> 00:23:08,762
Kira once told me
about a prearranged signal

418
00:23:08,801 --> 00:23:12,003
the resistance used on Terok Nor
to set up a meeting.

419
00:23:12,043 --> 00:23:14,447
Once we're finished here,
we'll head back

420
00:23:14,483 --> 00:23:17,115
to the Bajoran sector,
and I'll make the signal.

421
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:35,001
Ah.

422
00:23:44,998 --> 00:23:48,097
All recreation passes
are suspended

423
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:51,741
for Alpha unit personnel
until further notice.

424
00:24:03,145 --> 00:24:05,709
The Bajorans never did
have a sense of style.

425
00:24:05,753 --> 00:24:08,191
Turn the vase over
and the resistance appears.

426
00:24:08,225 --> 00:24:10,196
It's simple and effective.

427
00:24:10,231 --> 00:24:11,723
And they did it for years

428
00:24:11,768 --> 00:24:13,500
right under
the Cardassians' noses.

429
00:24:15,177 --> 00:24:17,581
Not under my nose, Captain.

430
00:24:17,616 --> 00:24:18,846
Under his.

431
00:24:23,632 --> 00:24:26,104
At least Dax is all right.

432
00:24:26,138 --> 00:24:27,334
Look at him.

433
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:31,044
The Commander of Terok Nor.

434
00:24:31,085 --> 00:24:34,526
Just another swaggering,
self-important Gul

435
00:24:34,628 --> 00:24:37,727
with too much vanity
and not enough ability.

436
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:40,937
Maybe, but he's no fool.

437
00:24:46,792 --> 00:24:48,056
Uh!

438
00:24:51,672 --> 00:24:52,936
Are you all right?

439
00:24:54,579 --> 00:24:56,516
Yes.

440
00:24:56,551 --> 00:24:59,319
Just slipped out of my hand.

441
00:25:06,242 --> 00:25:07,541
You wanted a meeting?

442
00:25:07,646 --> 00:25:08,774
Don't look at me.

443
00:25:08,816 --> 00:25:09,807
Eat your soup.

444
00:25:11,422 --> 00:25:14,328
I didn't think you would come
while Dukat was here.

445
00:25:14,364 --> 00:25:17,132
Everyone's watching
our gentle dictator

446
00:25:17,171 --> 00:25:19,871
stroll the Promenade
with his new girlfriend.

447
00:25:21,983 --> 00:25:24,387
Now, I hate soup
and I have no intention

448
00:25:24,423 --> 00:25:26,223
of finishing this entire bowl

449
00:25:26,261 --> 00:25:29,029
so whatever you want,
let's hear it.

450
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,869
We need to get off the station.

451
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,879
Why?

452
00:25:34,917 --> 00:25:35,943
Does it matter?

453
00:25:35,987 --> 00:25:38,323
Yes, as a matter of fact,
it does.

454
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:39,828
We're not a commuter service.

455
00:25:41,668 --> 00:25:43,468
If you're running from a dispute

456
00:25:43,506 --> 00:25:45,500
over chemicals
or women or smuggling

457
00:25:45,545 --> 00:25:46,673
you're on your own.

458
00:25:47,851 --> 00:25:49,651
If you've killed
one of the spoon heads...

459
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,316
- Spoon heads?!
- Garak!

460
00:25:52,362 --> 00:25:53,661
That's a different matter.

461
00:25:53,766 --> 00:25:56,638
We're not who we seem to be.

462
00:25:56,674 --> 00:25:59,944
I hope not, because you seem
to be wasting my time.

463
00:25:59,982 --> 00:26:02,979
Let's just say we're involved
with the Federation.

464
00:26:03,023 --> 00:26:04,356
Let me guess.

465
00:26:04,393 --> 00:26:06,991
You're Starfleet agents
operating undercover

466
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:08,628
posing as indigent Bajorans

467
00:26:08,738 --> 00:26:10,207
who happen to be...

468
00:26:12,248 --> 00:26:13,181
Dax!

469
00:26:14,286 --> 00:26:16,018
No, no!

470
00:26:16,057 --> 00:26:17,356
Captain! No!

471
00:26:19,366 --> 00:26:22,168
Secure all exits on 4-Alpha.

472
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:23,607
Captain, w-we can't stay here.

473
00:26:23,644 --> 00:26:24,908
They'll take care of her...

474
00:26:24,947 --> 00:26:25,916
You two, halt!

475
00:26:25,949 --> 00:26:27,384
But we must go!

476
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,054
Grab him!
Don't move!

477
00:26:49,611 --> 00:26:52,744
You'd think they'd put us
in our own cell block

478
00:26:52,785 --> 00:26:54,585
instead of with
the common criminals.

479
00:26:54,624 --> 00:26:56,527
After all, we are
accused of attempting

480
00:26:56,562 --> 00:26:58,624
to assassinate
the Station Commander.

481
00:26:58,668 --> 00:27:01,140
That deserves some respect.

482
00:27:01,174 --> 00:27:03,145
Maybe they'll salute
when they execute us.

483
00:27:06,421 --> 00:27:08,119
Quiet down.
Quiet down.

484
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,153
Quiet.
Quiet, please.

485
00:27:10,197 --> 00:27:11,689
Quiet, please!

486
00:27:15,578 --> 00:27:17,013
Kara Polus...

487
00:27:17,049 --> 00:27:19,317
Brin Tusk...

488
00:27:19,355 --> 00:27:21,326
and Marat Kobar...

489
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,958
your sentence
is five years hard labor.

490
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,372
Trial to confirm this sentence
will be held at 1700 hours.

491
00:27:28,411 --> 00:27:29,675
Benten Vek.

492
00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:30,684
Your fine has been paid

493
00:27:30,718 --> 00:27:33,156
and you'll be free to go
within the hour.

494
00:27:33,191 --> 00:27:38,000
Lobo, Horis, Romara,
Pelin and Gramm.

495
00:27:38,037 --> 00:27:39,803
You are being transferred
to Cardassian authorities

496
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,710
on Bajor for interrogation.

497
00:27:42,749 --> 00:27:44,218
No, no please...

498
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:54,707
Timor, Ishan, Jillur.

499
00:27:54,746 --> 00:27:56,376
You came aboard this station
two days ago

500
00:27:56,418 --> 00:27:58,116
from the Rakantha Province.

501
00:27:58,156 --> 00:28:00,720
Yesterday, you paid a visit
to the chemist's shop

502
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:03,496
and then fell asleep
on the Promenade.

503
00:28:03,536 --> 00:28:05,370
Last night, you were hired
as a cleanup crew

504
00:28:05,407 --> 00:28:06,467
by the Ferengi.

505
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,002
And after you were paid

506
00:28:08,048 --> 00:28:10,816
you went back
to the Bajoran sector

507
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:13,292
and attempted to murder
Gul Dukat

508
00:28:13,328 --> 00:28:15,926
with a chambered plasma grenade.

509
00:28:15,968 --> 00:28:17,666
We were sitting
at a table eating

510
00:28:17,706 --> 00:28:19,107
when the grenade went off.

511
00:28:19,143 --> 00:28:20,271
There were witnesses.

512
00:28:20,313 --> 00:28:22,512
None of which have come forth.

513
00:28:22,552 --> 00:28:23,521
Why would the witnesses

514
00:28:23,554 --> 00:28:25,149
risk their lives
for three strangers?

515
00:28:25,192 --> 00:28:28,189
They're out there, but you
have to go look for them.

516
00:28:28,234 --> 00:28:29,328
Epidermal scans

517
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:31,865
revealed the presence
of trinitrogen chloride

518
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,470
on your hands and clothing.

519
00:28:33,514 --> 00:28:37,855
TNC is one of the components
in plasma grenades.

520
00:28:37,892 --> 00:28:40,194
TNC is also a cleaning solution

521
00:28:40,231 --> 00:28:42,499
which is what we were
using in Quark's.

522
00:28:42,538 --> 00:28:45,033
Or you used the opportunity
of working at Quark's

523
00:28:45,077 --> 00:28:46,707
to obtain the TNC
in the first place.

524
00:28:46,748 --> 00:28:50,520
You all have ties
to the Bajoran underground.

525
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:51,618
You have three cousins

526
00:28:51,661 --> 00:28:54,293
who are known members
of the resistance.

527
00:28:54,335 --> 00:28:56,807
Five of your friends
are suspected sympathizers.

528
00:28:56,841 --> 00:29:00,282
After 50 years of occupation,
is there anyone left on Bajor

529
00:29:00,317 --> 00:29:03,655
who doesn't have some tie
to the resistance?

530
00:29:03,692 --> 00:29:05,218
Quiet!

531
00:29:06,633 --> 00:29:08,102
That may be true

532
00:29:08,137 --> 00:29:10,473
but you were seen
rushing toward Dukat

533
00:29:10,509 --> 00:29:11,705
after the explosion.

534
00:29:11,746 --> 00:29:13,740
Everyone else was running away.

535
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:15,254
I wanted to help my friend.

536
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:16,815
She was injured in the blast.

537
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:18,294
The report of the Cardassian
guards states

538
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:20,802
that you were found
over the body of Gul Dukat

539
00:29:20,837 --> 00:29:22,329
attempting to strangle him.

540
00:29:22,374 --> 00:29:23,434
That's a lie.

541
00:29:23,477 --> 00:29:25,277
Interrogate the troops yourself.

542
00:29:25,315 --> 00:29:27,787
Don't just take their report
at face value.

543
00:29:27,821 --> 00:29:31,888
I don't interrogate members
of the Cardassian military.

544
00:29:31,932 --> 00:29:34,427
Then run a ballistic analysis
of the explosion.

545
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:37,240
If you examine the fragmentation
dispersal pattern

546
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,649
you'll find that we couldn't
have thrown the grenade

547
00:29:39,686 --> 00:29:41,486
from our position at the table.

548
00:29:41,524 --> 00:29:42,584
It had to have come from...

549
00:29:42,627 --> 00:29:43,596
Quiet!

550
00:29:43,629 --> 00:29:45,999
Quiet down!

551
00:29:46,035 --> 00:29:50,604
There is sufficient evidence
for a conviction.

552
00:29:50,647 --> 00:29:52,447
All of which is circumstantial.

553
00:29:52,485 --> 00:29:53,818
Go beneath the surface.

554
00:29:53,856 --> 00:29:56,556
Conduct a real investigation.

555
00:29:56,596 --> 00:29:58,362
This investigation is over.

556
00:29:58,401 --> 00:30:00,031
Your case is going before

557
00:30:00,139 --> 00:30:01,973
a special tribunal
this afternoon.

558
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:05,314
You will be informed of the
sentence just before it meets.

559
00:30:07,023 --> 00:30:09,222
No! Wait!
I need to talk to you!

560
00:30:09,262 --> 00:30:11,461
Let me talk to you alone
for just a moment!

561
00:30:11,502 --> 00:30:14,724
Please! Listen to me!

562
00:30:14,857 --> 00:30:16,190
That's enough.

563
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:21,439
How do you feel?

564
00:30:21,475 --> 00:30:23,947
Better than the last time.

565
00:30:23,981 --> 00:30:25,280
Last time?

566
00:30:25,318 --> 00:30:28,554
This is the fourth
assassination attempt

567
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:29,892
I've survived.

568
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:32,768
Maybe you should find
another job.

569
00:30:35,109 --> 00:30:36,635
Maybe I should.

570
00:30:36,681 --> 00:30:40,555
I'm glad to see you
have your appetite back.

571
00:30:40,591 --> 00:30:44,089
I don't get to eat
like this very often.

572
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:46,833
I've wanted to increase rations

573
00:30:46,874 --> 00:30:50,372
in the Bajoran sector
for some time now.

574
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:54,415
But the resistance
makes it almost impossible

575
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:57,434
to show any sort of kindness
to your people.

576
00:30:57,468 --> 00:31:00,636
You really want to help
my people, don't you?

577
00:31:00,676 --> 00:31:02,510
Yes, of course.

578
00:31:02,547 --> 00:31:05,544
The Bajorans are...

579
00:31:05,589 --> 00:31:08,791
well, they're like
my children, I suppose

580
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:12,967
and like any father, I want
only what's best for them.

581
00:31:16,885 --> 00:31:19,015
And you still feel that way now

582
00:31:19,058 --> 00:31:21,360
after some of your children
have tried to kill you?

583
00:31:21,396 --> 00:31:24,529
Bad manners
are the fault of the parent

584
00:31:24,571 --> 00:31:25,562
not the child.

585
00:31:28,081 --> 00:31:31,055
My weakness is I'm too...

586
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:32,821
generous...

587
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,694
too forgiving.

588
00:31:34,732 --> 00:31:36,635
My heart is too big.

589
00:31:40,546 --> 00:31:43,075
And so is your ego.

590
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,185
"Yes, I know I don't
look Cardassian.

591
00:31:46,228 --> 00:31:49,066
"You see, I was
surgically altered

592
00:31:49,102 --> 00:31:50,697
to appear Bajoran."

593
00:31:50,739 --> 00:31:54,442
But what if genetic scans
show no Cardassian DNA

594
00:31:54,482 --> 00:31:56,350
in my cellular structure?

595
00:31:56,387 --> 00:31:58,483
In that case, I'll suggest...

596
00:31:58,527 --> 00:32:00,019
Tell me about Thrax.

597
00:32:02,437 --> 00:32:03,770
What do you want to know?

598
00:32:03,807 --> 00:32:05,744
Something about his background.

599
00:32:05,778 --> 00:32:07,008
He seems unusual.

600
00:32:07,048 --> 00:32:09,247
Doesn't have
that casual brutality

601
00:32:09,288 --> 00:32:10,655
I've come to expect

602
00:32:10,691 --> 00:32:12,787
from Cardassian
security officers.

603
00:32:12,831 --> 00:32:14,631
What makes Thrax different?

604
00:32:16,473 --> 00:32:17,737
I wouldn't know.

605
00:32:17,776 --> 00:32:20,476
He was gone by the time
I came aboard the station.

606
00:32:20,517 --> 00:32:23,319
Which brings up a good point.

607
00:32:24,327 --> 00:32:25,922
Why is he here now?

608
00:32:25,965 --> 00:32:27,093
Garak said that you

609
00:32:27,134 --> 00:32:29,629
were the Security Chief
during this time.

610
00:32:29,673 --> 00:32:32,373
You're implying that I
should know the answers...

611
00:32:32,414 --> 00:32:34,510
that I'm holding
back information?

612
00:32:34,553 --> 00:32:39,328
I'm saying that maybe you know
more than you think you do.

613
00:32:39,366 --> 00:32:43,365
You lived here, on Terok Nor.

614
00:32:43,409 --> 00:32:47,682
You're supposed to be out there
now instead of Thrax.

615
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,984
Think, Odo.

616
00:32:49,024 --> 00:32:50,995
There might be some connection

617
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:53,434
between you and what's
happening here.

618
00:32:53,469 --> 00:32:55,064
I don't know.

619
00:33:03,261 --> 00:33:04,730
Miss me?

620
00:33:13,354 --> 00:33:15,849
Dukat's personal shuttle
is in Docking Bay 3.

621
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:17,362
What about the station
defense system?

622
00:33:17,398 --> 00:33:18,731
I've got the computer
tied up in knots.

623
00:33:18,768 --> 00:33:19,862
I don't think they'll be able...

624
00:33:19,904 --> 00:33:21,499
Halt!

625
00:34:07,762 --> 00:34:08,788
A changeling?

626
00:34:08,831 --> 00:34:10,461
We'll figure that out later.

627
00:34:13,644 --> 00:34:14,977
Here it is.

628
00:34:30,153 --> 00:34:32,021
We just got the word.

629
00:34:32,058 --> 00:34:35,625
Your execution's
been scheduled for 1900.

630
00:34:35,668 --> 00:34:37,366
That's two hours from now.

631
00:34:47,382 --> 00:34:49,877
We've got to find
another way out of here.

632
00:34:49,923 --> 00:34:51,017
We tried that.

633
00:34:51,058 --> 00:34:53,086
Escape doesn't seem
to be the answer.

634
00:34:53,131 --> 00:34:54,761
How could Thrax
be a changeling?

635
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:55,792
In this time period

636
00:34:55,838 --> 00:34:57,398
the Founders didn't know
about the wormhole.

637
00:34:57,442 --> 00:34:58,433
I don't know.

638
00:34:58,477 --> 00:34:59,969
Well, putting aside the newest

639
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:01,382
shape-shifter in town
for the time being

640
00:35:01,419 --> 00:35:03,014
how did we end up
back in this cell?

641
00:35:03,057 --> 00:35:04,026
I don't know.

642
00:35:04,059 --> 00:35:05,392
Care to guess?

643
00:35:05,429 --> 00:35:07,423
What makes you think
I have the answer?

644
00:35:07,468 --> 00:35:08,835
You've been acting strangely

645
00:35:08,872 --> 00:35:11,504
ever since we first woke up
on the Promenade.

646
00:35:11,545 --> 00:35:13,709
Continually distracted,
depressed and agitated.

647
00:35:13,751 --> 00:35:16,087
And you knew the names of the
people we're supposed to be.

648
00:35:16,123 --> 00:35:17,855
You knew the details
of the case

649
00:35:17,895 --> 00:35:19,023
like you were there.

650
00:35:19,064 --> 00:35:20,090
But you couldn't
have been there

651
00:35:20,134 --> 00:35:21,433
because it happened
before you came

652
00:35:21,471 --> 00:35:22,440
aboard the station.

653
00:35:22,474 --> 00:35:26,075
Everything seems
to lead back to you

654
00:35:26,116 --> 00:35:27,210
and I want to know why.

655
00:35:27,252 --> 00:35:29,816
You said you wanted to see me?

656
00:35:29,859 --> 00:35:31,727
Yes. It's urgent.

657
00:35:42,659 --> 00:35:45,291
I'm listening,
but I don't have much time.

658
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:48,239
You are about to make
a very serious mistake.

659
00:35:48,274 --> 00:35:49,573
Because you're innocent,
of course.

660
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:50,579
All of you.

661
00:35:50,612 --> 00:35:52,172
That's right,
and I can prove it.

662
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:54,587
Compare this attack to
recent bombings on Bajor.

663
00:35:54,623 --> 00:35:55,990
You'll find a similarity

664
00:35:56,027 --> 00:35:58,089
to four incidents
in Musilla Province

665
00:35:58,132 --> 00:36:00,468
none of which
we could have done.

666
00:36:00,505 --> 00:36:01,804
This proves nothing.

667
00:36:01,842 --> 00:36:03,437
And under Cardassian law

668
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,884
the accused
must prove his innocence.

669
00:36:05,919 --> 00:36:08,859
Since the evidence in this case
is sufficient

670
00:36:08,894 --> 00:36:11,868
to warrant conviction,
the investigation is over.

671
00:36:11,901 --> 00:36:15,536
Your job is to find the truth

672
00:36:15,577 --> 00:36:19,018
not obtain convictions.

673
00:36:19,054 --> 00:36:21,116
Truth.

674
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:23,221
You want the truth?

675
00:36:24,802 --> 00:36:26,169
All right, the truth is

676
00:36:26,205 --> 00:36:28,267
that none of you
would be accused...

677
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:30,179
none of you would even be here...

678
00:36:30,216 --> 00:36:33,213
if the Bajorans weren't fighting
the Cardassians.

679
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:34,590
It's futile.

680
00:36:34,627 --> 00:36:36,689
The occupation
has lasted for 50 years

681
00:36:36,799 --> 00:36:38,929
and it will probably last
another 50.

682
00:36:38,972 --> 00:36:40,909
I wouldn't be
too sure about that.

683
00:36:40,944 --> 00:36:43,542
Why not just accept it?!

684
00:36:43,584 --> 00:36:47,526
If the Bajoran people would
accept their place in history

685
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,828
none of this would be happening.

686
00:36:49,867 --> 00:36:53,502
We are talking about
the attempt on Gul Dukat's life

687
00:36:53,543 --> 00:36:57,485
not the socio-political
ramifications of the resistance.

688
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,080
It's all part
of the same problem!

689
00:36:59,124 --> 00:37:04,160
When your people resort
to terrorism and violence

690
00:37:04,204 --> 00:37:07,839
they're fighting against order,
against stability

691
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,947
against the rule of law...
and this must be stopped.

692
00:37:13,595 --> 00:37:18,472
There is more to life
than the rule of law.

693
00:37:18,508 --> 00:37:21,710
It has been my observation

694
00:37:21,749 --> 00:37:25,213
that only the guilty
make that kind of statement.

695
00:37:31,475 --> 00:37:33,207
I didn't want to tell you this...

696
00:37:33,246 --> 00:37:35,582
I don't know what
the consequences will be...

697
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:38,787
but we are not terrorists.

698
00:37:38,893 --> 00:37:40,693
We're not even Bajorans.

699
00:37:40,732 --> 00:37:42,896
There's been a temporal
displacement of some kind.

700
00:37:42,938 --> 00:37:45,172
We don't belong in this time.

701
00:37:45,211 --> 00:37:47,706
We're from the future.

702
00:37:47,751 --> 00:37:49,220
I know.

703
00:37:49,254 --> 00:37:50,621
You know?

704
00:37:50,658 --> 00:37:53,632
Then what are you going
to do about it?

705
00:37:53,666 --> 00:37:55,660
What I am supposed to do.

706
00:37:55,704 --> 00:37:58,906
Nothing more, nothing less.

707
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,779
The question is:

708
00:38:02,823 --> 00:38:05,193
What are you going to do...

709
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:07,966
Odo?

710
00:38:24,078 --> 00:38:26,049
It's too late for them now.

711
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:27,849
It's out of my hands.

712
00:38:27,955 --> 00:38:29,858
Why aren't I with them?

713
00:38:29,893 --> 00:38:32,765
There were only
three terrorists, Odo.

714
00:38:32,801 --> 00:38:34,100
You know that.

715
00:38:34,138 --> 00:38:35,698
This is the price
for taking up arms

716
00:38:35,741 --> 00:38:37,405
against those
who would protect you...

717
00:38:37,446 --> 00:38:41,320
who have only your best
interests at heart.

718
00:38:41,356 --> 00:38:42,848
They haven't done anything.

719
00:38:42,894 --> 00:38:44,227
They don't belong here.

720
00:38:44,264 --> 00:38:46,132
It's already happened, Odo.

721
00:38:46,169 --> 00:38:47,365
But this isn't what happened.

722
00:38:47,405 --> 00:38:48,897
It wasn't these people.

723
00:38:49,009 --> 00:38:50,912
Proceed with the execution.

724
00:38:52,418 --> 00:38:54,252
No.

725
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,762
I'm not going to let this
happen again.

726
00:38:56,796 --> 00:38:58,288
Not again!

727
00:39:00,138 --> 00:39:01,607
You can't execute them.

728
00:39:01,642 --> 00:39:03,168
You don't even belong here.

729
00:39:03,213 --> 00:39:04,979
I do.

730
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:38,241
Constable?

731
00:39:38,281 --> 00:39:41,278
That's exactly how it happened
seven years ago.

732
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,122
It was you all along.

733
00:39:46,803 --> 00:39:48,467
Yes.

734
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:55,048
I was Chief of Security
on the Promenade.

735
00:39:55,091 --> 00:39:59,158
I was the one
who charged those men

736
00:39:59,202 --> 00:40:01,105
with a crime
they didn't commit

737
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:05,516
and I was the one who turned
them over to Dukat.

738
00:40:05,552 --> 00:40:07,318
Three days after the executions

739
00:40:07,357 --> 00:40:08,952
there was another bombing
on the Promenade

740
00:40:08,994 --> 00:40:11,660
identical to the one
that almost killed Dukat.

741
00:40:13,138 --> 00:40:18,676
Timor, Ishan and Jillur
were innocent.

742
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:20,747
All the evidence was there...

743
00:40:20,791 --> 00:40:24,129
the inconsistencies
in the reports

744
00:40:24,166 --> 00:40:26,296
of the soldiers
who arrested them

745
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:30,281
a pattern of bombings,
the ballistics...

746
00:40:30,316 --> 00:40:33,654
it was all there
from the beginning.

747
00:40:35,329 --> 00:40:38,269
But I was too busy

748
00:40:38,303 --> 00:40:42,644
too concerned
with maintaining order

749
00:40:42,681 --> 00:40:44,845
and the rule of law.

750
00:40:47,527 --> 00:40:49,395
I thought of myself
as the outsider

751
00:40:49,432 --> 00:40:52,565
the shape-shifter
who cared for nothing

752
00:40:52,607 --> 00:40:53,769
but justice.

753
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:56,841
It never occurred to me
that I could fail, but I did

754
00:40:56,885 --> 00:41:00,759
and I never wanted anyone
to know the truth...

755
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:05,598
that seven years ago

756
00:41:05,641 --> 00:41:10,677
I allowed three innocent men
to die.

757
00:41:20,512 --> 00:41:21,674
Constable?

758
00:41:24,055 --> 00:41:27,120
Whatever it is you've been
through has taken its toll.

759
00:41:43,139 --> 00:41:45,167
Far as I can tell,
the four of you were locked

760
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:47,204
into some version
of the Great Link.

761
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:50,251
The Link?

762
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:52,785
How is that possible?

763
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:54,562
I'm a solid now.

764
00:41:54,601 --> 00:41:57,233
Well, it seems you're not
as solid as you think.

765
00:41:57,275 --> 00:41:59,941
When I ran a neurochemical
scan of your brain

766
00:41:59,982 --> 00:42:02,716
I found residual traces
of morphogenic enzymes

767
00:42:02,756 --> 00:42:05,558
which I've only detected before
in changelings.

768
00:42:05,596 --> 00:42:07,533
When the plasma storm
hit the runabout

769
00:42:07,569 --> 00:42:08,902
it activated the enzymes

770
00:42:09,005 --> 00:42:11,739
and initiated
a telepathic response.

771
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,682
Your mind reached out
to find other changelings

772
00:42:13,717 --> 00:42:15,118
to form the Link

773
00:42:15,155 --> 00:42:18,323
but all it could find
were Sisko, Dax and Garak.

774
00:42:19,566 --> 00:42:21,298
And just before the accident

775
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:23,936
I was thinking
about the executions.

776
00:42:24,011 --> 00:42:28,478
Somehow, being in the Link
must've forced me to relive it

777
00:42:28,522 --> 00:42:32,123
and admit the truth
about what I'd done.

778
00:42:32,165 --> 00:42:34,227
It would make
a fascinating paper.

779
00:42:35,374 --> 00:42:38,314
Although,
I don't intend to write one.

780
00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:47,930
If you have any questions,
uh, you know where to find me.

781
00:42:56,329 --> 00:42:59,735
When I first read your report...

782
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:02,710
I didn't know what to think.

783
00:43:02,745 --> 00:43:04,875
So I said to myself,
"That's all right, Nerys.

784
00:43:04,917 --> 00:43:06,147
"You're stunned.

785
00:43:06,187 --> 00:43:09,025
You need to let it
sink in a little."

786
00:43:10,698 --> 00:43:13,398
But it's been two days, Odo.

787
00:43:15,043 --> 00:43:17,447
I still don't know
what to think.

788
00:43:19,922 --> 00:43:21,586
I'm guilty.

789
00:43:21,627 --> 00:43:23,791
What more is there to say?

790
00:43:23,832 --> 00:43:25,165
Maybe nothing.

791
00:43:25,203 --> 00:43:28,177
Maybe a lot.

792
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:30,808
I believed in you.

793
00:43:30,851 --> 00:43:31,945
A lot of people did.

794
00:43:31,988 --> 00:43:32,957
You were special.

795
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:34,050
You were the one man

796
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,222
who stood apart
from everyone else...

797
00:43:36,265 --> 00:43:38,065
the one man who stood
for justice.

798
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:39,161
Now what?

799
00:43:41,379 --> 00:43:43,247
Now I'm...

800
00:43:43,284 --> 00:43:45,221
just another...

801
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:47,819
imperfect solid.

802
00:43:47,862 --> 00:43:51,326
Okay.

803
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:54,242
The Prophets know
I'm not perfect.

804
00:43:56,083 --> 00:43:57,416
I guess the truth is

805
00:43:57,453 --> 00:44:00,393
that anyone who lived through
the occupation

806
00:44:00,428 --> 00:44:02,992
had to get a little dirty.

807
00:44:04,672 --> 00:44:06,267
But I need to know

808
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:10,946
that no other innocent people
died on your watch, Odo.

809
00:44:10,989 --> 00:44:13,723
That this was the only time.

810
00:44:18,073 --> 00:44:19,839
I'm not sure.

811
00:44:22,351 --> 00:44:24,322
I hope so.
