1
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:05,161
Last time on
<i>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine...</i>

2
00:00:05,203 --> 00:00:08,870
Starfleet has chosen you to plan
the invasion of Cardassia.

3
00:00:32,697 --> 00:00:34,724
I managed to save
the Dax symbiont.

4
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:36,203
There was...

5
00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:38,800
nothing I could do for Jadzia.

6
00:00:54,946 --> 00:00:58,181
Federation soldiers
have landed on Cardassian soil

7
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,159
and now you're telling me
the wormhole is gone?

8
00:01:01,192 --> 00:01:02,217
And with it, any chance

9
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:04,231
of getting reinforcements
from the Gamma Quadrant.

10
00:01:04,266 --> 00:01:06,999
Why aren't you still here,
Jadzia?

11
00:01:07,038 --> 00:01:10,034
I need you to help me
sort things out.

12
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:12,106
Something's happened
to the Prophets...

13
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,419
something that's made them
turn their backs on Bajor

14
00:01:15,457 --> 00:01:17,256
and I'm responsible

15
00:01:17,328 --> 00:01:19,355
and I don't know
what to do about it

16
00:01:19,399 --> 00:01:24,138
how to make... it right again.

17
00:01:25,512 --> 00:01:28,109
I've failed as the Emissary...

18
00:01:28,152 --> 00:01:30,385
and for the first time
in my life

19
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:34,158
I've failed in my duty
as a Starfleet officer.

20
00:01:34,199 --> 00:01:35,896
The station's all yours, Major.

21
00:01:35,936 --> 00:01:37,803
She'll be here
when you get back.

22
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,078
Let's go home, Jake.

23
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:46,923
And now, the continuation.

24
00:01:56,715 --> 00:01:58,685
Colonel.

25
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,689
I wish you'd stop doing that.

26
00:02:00,724 --> 00:02:01,953
Doing what?

27
00:02:01,993 --> 00:02:03,188
Calling me by my rank.

28
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:04,926
I was promoted two months ago.

29
00:02:04,966 --> 00:02:06,629
Besides, it sounds so formal.

30
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,634
Well, has Admiral Ross...
or should I say "Bill"...

31
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,308
arrived yet?

32
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:14,616
The Admiral's ship
is due in three hours

33
00:02:14,654 --> 00:02:17,319
and I wish I knew what he wanted
to talk to me about.

34
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,989
Maybe he's bringing good news.

35
00:02:19,031 --> 00:02:20,523
We could certainly use it.

36
00:02:20,567 --> 00:02:22,161
Yeah, well, don't get
your hopes up.

37
00:02:22,203 --> 00:02:24,766
There was something about
the tone of his voice.

38
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,279
Something ominous?

39
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:27,338
Something pleasant.

40
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:29,784
It was like he was going
out of his way to be nice.

41
00:02:29,821 --> 00:02:30,789
I see.

42
00:02:30,823 --> 00:02:32,315
Well, whatever he wants
to tell me

43
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,954
he knows I'm not
going to like it.

44
00:02:33,997 --> 00:02:35,523
And how can you be so sure?

45
00:02:35,566 --> 00:02:37,696
It comes with the job.

46
00:02:37,738 --> 00:02:38,706
Uh-huh.

47
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,969
No, I'm serious.

48
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,502
Sitting in the Captain's chair

49
00:02:41,547 --> 00:02:43,073
having that kind
of responsibility...

50
00:02:43,117 --> 00:02:44,244
it focuses you.

51
00:02:44,286 --> 00:02:46,222
Well, I'll take
your word for it.

52
00:02:51,401 --> 00:02:52,927
How long have they been there?

53
00:02:52,971 --> 00:02:54,030
Three days.

54
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:55,543
I remember when the cult

55
00:02:55,577 --> 00:02:57,376
of the Pah-wraiths
used to be a joke.

56
00:02:57,415 --> 00:02:59,886
Now those red armbands are
appearing all over Bajor.

57
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,617
It's like everyone's
gone crazy.

58
00:03:01,658 --> 00:03:04,061
A lot of people feel
abandoned by the Prophets.

59
00:03:04,096 --> 00:03:06,294
Believe me, I know
how they feel.

60
00:03:06,334 --> 00:03:08,828
It's no excuse
to turn to hate and fear.

61
00:03:08,873 --> 00:03:10,102
In times of trouble

62
00:03:10,143 --> 00:03:12,774
some people find comfort
in hate and fear.

63
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,922
If you like, I can charge
them with loitering

64
00:03:16,957 --> 00:03:18,392
and have them removed
from the station.

65
00:03:18,428 --> 00:03:19,623
Ah, what good would that do?

66
00:03:19,663 --> 00:03:23,364
I keep thinking if the
Emissary were here...

67
00:03:23,405 --> 00:03:24,772
things might be different.

68
00:03:24,808 --> 00:03:25,798
I would've thought

69
00:03:25,844 --> 00:03:28,111
we would've heard
from Captain Sisko by now.

70
00:03:28,148 --> 00:03:30,244
Not a word in three months.

71
00:03:30,287 --> 00:03:32,120
Nerys...

72
00:03:33,394 --> 00:03:35,991
I realize that things
may seem

73
00:03:36,033 --> 00:03:38,766
bleak at the moment,
but there's always hope.

74
00:03:40,042 --> 00:03:42,479
When did you turn
into an optimist?

75
00:03:44,184 --> 00:03:46,417
Must've been that day
in front of Quark's

76
00:03:46,455 --> 00:03:48,322
when we kissed
for the first time.

77
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,159
Hmm.

78
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:53,766
That was some kiss, wasn't it?

79
00:03:53,805 --> 00:03:55,331
Changed my life.

80
00:04:08,905 --> 00:04:11,172
Gentlemen... we are home.

81
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,180
Oh, there should be a law
against convoy duty

82
00:04:13,214 --> 00:04:14,649
lasting more than ten days.

83
00:04:14,684 --> 00:04:16,917
I'll say one thing
for guarding convoys...

84
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:19,689
it's usually a lot safer than
being on the front lines.

85
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:22,029
Is that the reason you joined
Starfleet, Ensign...

86
00:04:22,067 --> 00:04:23,262
to be safe?

87
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,901
I... I didn't mean that
the way it sounded, sir.

88
00:04:25,943 --> 00:04:28,574
In wartime, it is the duty
of every soldier to fight.

89
00:04:28,615 --> 00:04:29,640
Yes, sir.

90
00:04:29,684 --> 00:04:32,121
The invasion of Cardassia
has ground to a halt

91
00:04:32,156 --> 00:04:33,989
while our casualties
continue to mount.

92
00:04:34,026 --> 00:04:37,363
It is a time for warriors
to do great deeds

93
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,835
to triumph in glorious battles

94
00:04:38,871 --> 00:04:42,835
not waste away protecting
a shipment of stem bolts.

95
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:50,851
I hope Commander Worf doesn't
think I'm afraid to fight.

96
00:04:50,898 --> 00:04:53,529
Relax.
Don't take it so personally.

97
00:04:53,637 --> 00:04:56,040
Worf is just going through
a bad time at the moment.

98
00:04:56,075 --> 00:04:58,239
I think he needs to focus
on something other than Jadzia

99
00:04:58,281 --> 00:04:59,249
and I hate to admit it

100
00:04:59,283 --> 00:05:02,084
but a little combat duty
might just do the trick.

101
00:05:02,122 --> 00:05:05,493
Pretty soon the <i>Defiant</i>
will be going into battle.

102
00:05:05,529 --> 00:05:06,497
Worf will be happy

103
00:05:06,531 --> 00:05:07,830
and the rest of us
will be miserable.

104
00:05:07,868 --> 00:05:10,032
It's not
that I'm afraid to fight.

105
00:05:10,073 --> 00:05:12,066
I just don't want to die.

106
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:15,048
I wish Captain Sisko were here.

107
00:05:15,084 --> 00:05:16,610
So do I, Ensign.

108
00:05:16,654 --> 00:05:18,624
So do I.

109
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,858
If I were you,
I'd order the crawfish étouffée.

110
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,635
And if it's good enough for you,
it's good enough for him.

111
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:51,689
I think table five
is ready to order.

112
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:54,464
He's been at that piano
since 7:00 this morning.

113
00:05:54,504 --> 00:05:56,873
The customers seem to like it.

114
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:58,344
Grandpa...

115
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:00,543
Look, I'm worried, too.

116
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,553
But he's got something
to work out.

117
00:06:02,588 --> 00:06:04,558
Best we leave him alone.

118
00:06:04,659 --> 00:06:07,222
We've left him alone
for the past three months.

119
00:06:07,265 --> 00:06:08,426
He said he came here

120
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,529
to figure out a way
to contact the Prophets

121
00:06:10,572 --> 00:06:11,973
to make things right.

122
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:14,105
So far, he hasn't even left
the restaurant.

123
00:07:10,837 --> 00:07:12,466
Dad...

124
00:07:12,508 --> 00:07:13,737
what's wrong?

125
00:07:13,778 --> 00:07:14,837
Dad?

126
00:07:16,517 --> 00:07:18,886
I had a vision
from the Prophets.

127
00:07:20,859 --> 00:07:23,592
I was on Tyree in the desert...

128
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:25,102
digging in the sand.

129
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,101
And I uncovered a face...

130
00:07:29,144 --> 00:07:31,240
the face of a woman.

131
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:34,047
And?

132
00:07:35,225 --> 00:07:37,628
And that's all.

133
00:07:37,664 --> 00:07:39,634
Who was she?

134
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:42,641
I've never seen her before.

135
00:07:44,312 --> 00:07:48,013
But now I know why I
came back here, Jake.

136
00:07:49,088 --> 00:07:50,990
I have to find her.

137
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,866
I have to.

138
00:09:57,914 --> 00:09:59,143
Colonel, I really don't see

139
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:01,119
anything for you
to be concerned about.

140
00:10:01,155 --> 00:10:02,556
I've met Senator Cretak

141
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:05,688
and found her to be...
very cooperative.

142
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:08,596
For a Romulan.

143
00:10:08,637 --> 00:10:10,163
Cretak's a strong supporter
of the Alliance

144
00:10:10,207 --> 00:10:11,676
and we're going to need
that kind of support

145
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:12,736
if we're going to win this war.

146
00:10:12,847 --> 00:10:14,214
I wouldn't care
if the Romulans

147
00:10:14,249 --> 00:10:15,274
were the only thing

148
00:10:15,318 --> 00:10:17,721
standing between us
and total annihilation.

149
00:10:17,757 --> 00:10:19,192
I would still think twice

150
00:10:19,227 --> 00:10:20,526
before allowing
them to establish

151
00:10:20,564 --> 00:10:22,865
a military presence
here on the station.

152
00:10:22,902 --> 00:10:24,496
We're just talking
about a few officers

153
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:25,906
for the Senator and her staff.

154
00:10:25,942 --> 00:10:27,571
And a contingent
of personal guards...

155
00:10:27,612 --> 00:10:29,081
A dozen people at most.

156
00:10:29,116 --> 00:10:30,983
Besides, it's just
a temporary arrangement

157
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:32,386
until the end of the war.

158
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:33,858
And when will that be?

159
00:10:36,599 --> 00:10:38,797
Let's get one thing straight,
Colonel.

160
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,898
I came here
as a courtesy to you.

161
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:43,208
This decision
has already been made.

162
00:10:43,247 --> 00:10:45,080
And I have to live with it.

163
00:10:45,117 --> 00:10:46,609
That's right.

164
00:10:50,596 --> 00:10:53,535
You've done a fine job
taking over for Captain Sisko.

165
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,733
I'm just keeping his seat warm.

166
00:10:57,578 --> 00:10:59,708
You still think
he's coming back?

167
00:11:00,718 --> 00:11:02,244
Don't you?

168
00:11:05,228 --> 00:11:06,822
I'll be in touch.

169
00:11:21,564 --> 00:11:22,554
As you can see, we've halted

170
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,003
the Klingon advance
against Monac IV.

171
00:11:25,038 --> 00:11:27,669
We estimate their casualties
to be at least 30 percent.

172
00:11:27,711 --> 00:11:30,239
They should've been higher.

173
00:11:30,283 --> 00:11:32,344
Nevertheless,
congratulations, Damar.

174
00:11:32,388 --> 00:11:34,859
The enemy remains bottled up
in the Chin'toka system

175
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,263
and that's where they'll stay
until we destroy them.

176
00:11:38,301 --> 00:11:39,634
I'd offer you a glass

177
00:11:39,671 --> 00:11:42,142
but I know how much
you dislike <i>kanar.</i>

178
00:11:42,176 --> 00:11:44,647
I'm beginning to think
you like it too much.

179
00:11:44,682 --> 00:11:45,877
I wouldn't trust a Cardassian

180
00:11:45,984 --> 00:11:48,820
that didn't enjoy a glass
of <i>kanar</i> every once in a while.

181
00:11:49,927 --> 00:11:52,558
Tell me, Damar,
when you're alone

182
00:11:52,599 --> 00:11:53,898
do you even bother with a glass

183
00:11:53,969 --> 00:11:56,908
or do you just drink that swill
directly from the bottle?

184
00:11:56,942 --> 00:11:58,673
Depends on my mood

185
00:11:58,712 --> 00:12:01,947
and right now,
I feel like celebrating.

186
00:12:01,986 --> 00:12:05,050
We owe Gul Dukat
a debt of gratitude.

187
00:12:06,062 --> 00:12:08,397
Unfortunately, I agree.

188
00:12:08,434 --> 00:12:12,739
Somehow, releasing that
Pah-wraith into the wormhole

189
00:12:12,776 --> 00:12:15,646
has shifted the momentum
of the war into our favor.

190
00:12:16,752 --> 00:12:18,848
You ever wonder what goes on?

191
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,587
Inside the wormhole, I mean?

192
00:12:21,763 --> 00:12:23,392
Not really.

193
00:12:23,433 --> 00:12:25,666
The Prophets and the Pah-wraiths

194
00:12:25,705 --> 00:12:29,236
locked in some form
of... celestial battle.

195
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,842
It's fascinating.

196
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:35,917
I never realized you had
such a vivid imagination.

197
00:12:35,994 --> 00:12:38,795
There's a lot about me
you don't know.

198
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:40,938
Just remember...

199
00:12:40,972 --> 00:12:45,004
too much imagination
can be... dangerous.

200
00:13:09,702 --> 00:13:11,103
Dad, Grandpa and I

201
00:13:11,138 --> 00:13:12,937
are going to Armstrong Park
to listen to some music.

202
00:13:12,975 --> 00:13:14,102
You want to come?

203
00:13:14,145 --> 00:13:15,546
You two go ahead.

204
00:13:17,219 --> 00:13:18,346
Who's that?

205
00:13:18,387 --> 00:13:20,152
The woman in my vision.

206
00:13:20,191 --> 00:13:22,058
I don't want to forget her face.

207
00:13:24,434 --> 00:13:25,903
I'll see you in the morning.

208
00:13:25,937 --> 00:13:27,839
Hey, I-I've seen her before.

209
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,104
Where?

210
00:13:29,145 --> 00:13:30,978
In a photograph.

211
00:13:31,048 --> 00:13:33,611
Yeah, I'll be right back.

212
00:13:52,729 --> 00:13:53,924
Here she is.

213
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:55,367
I knew it.

214
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:56,837
That's her, isn't it?

215
00:13:58,676 --> 00:14:00,669
She's with Grandpa.

216
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:01,943
I don't understand.

217
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,543
Who is she?

218
00:14:03,587 --> 00:14:05,318
Why don't you ask Grandpa?

219
00:14:05,357 --> 00:14:07,122
Ask me what?

220
00:14:12,807 --> 00:14:14,208
This woman.

221
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,807
Where'd you get this?

222
00:14:17,851 --> 00:14:18,841
I found it last week

223
00:14:18,886 --> 00:14:20,515
when I was cleaning out
the storage room.

224
00:14:20,557 --> 00:14:22,459
I-I meant to ask you about it.

225
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:26,030
So, who is she, Dad?

226
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:27,037
No one at all.

227
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,039
You hear me?

228
00:14:28,141 --> 00:14:29,336
She's no one at all.

229
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,219
Hey, pally, where you
been keeping yourself?

230
00:15:08,262 --> 00:15:10,563
Convoy duty.

231
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,399
Doesn't sound very exciting.

232
00:15:12,438 --> 00:15:13,531
It was not.

233
00:15:13,574 --> 00:15:15,271
Well, if you're looking
for some action

234
00:15:15,311 --> 00:15:16,644
you've come to the right place.

235
00:15:16,681 --> 00:15:18,651
What do you say we hit
the crap tables, huh?

236
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:20,918
Or maybe some blackjack
to get the blood pumping?

237
00:15:20,957 --> 00:15:22,084
Sing the song.

238
00:15:22,126 --> 00:15:23,459
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

239
00:15:23,496 --> 00:15:24,521
Sing the song.

240
00:15:24,564 --> 00:15:27,560
Come on, pally,
why rub salt in an open wound?

241
00:15:27,605 --> 00:15:30,202
You are a hologram.

242
00:15:30,244 --> 00:15:33,411
You are programmed
to do as I say.

243
00:15:33,451 --> 00:15:35,752
Sing the song.

244
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,123
It's your dime.

245
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:38,651
Park it right there.

246
00:15:40,734 --> 00:15:42,932
And don't say I didn't warn you.

247
00:15:42,971 --> 00:15:45,534
Which reminds me of a story
Joey once told me...

248
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:46,704
Sing!

249
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:50,118
Son of a gun,
I think he means it.

250
00:15:50,154 --> 00:15:52,591
Hey, you heard the man.

251
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,613
When somebody loves you

252
00:16:02,648 --> 00:16:06,247
It's no good
unless he loves you

253
00:16:07,659 --> 00:16:11,258
All the way

254
00:16:12,437 --> 00:16:15,376
Happy to be near you

255
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:20,409
When you need someone
to cheer you

256
00:16:20,454 --> 00:16:25,090
All the way

257
00:16:25,131 --> 00:16:32,876
Taller
than the tallest tree is

258
00:16:32,915 --> 00:16:36,320
That's how it's got to feel

259
00:16:38,226 --> 00:16:45,368
Deeper
than the deep blue sea is

260
00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:49,578
That's how deep it goes
if it's real

261
00:16:51,188 --> 00:16:54,559
When somebody needs you

262
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:58,755
It's no good
unless he needs you

263
00:16:58,888 --> 00:17:03,627
All the way

264
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:06,433
Through the good or lean years

265
00:17:06,471 --> 00:17:11,141
And through all
the in-between years

266
00:17:11,182 --> 00:17:16,216
Come what may

267
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:23,573
For who knows
where the road will lead us?

268
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:27,449
Only a fool would say

269
00:17:29,054 --> 00:17:32,084
But if you let me love you

270
00:17:32,128 --> 00:17:36,536
It's for sure
I'm gonna love you

271
00:17:36,571 --> 00:17:40,033
All the way...

272
00:17:47,328 --> 00:17:49,595
This monitor is still off line.

273
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:51,763
I want it operational
within the hour.

274
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:59,248
I hope all the chairs
on this station

275
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:00,780
aren't this uncomfortable.

276
00:18:00,824 --> 00:18:02,191
I'm afraid they are.

277
00:18:03,464 --> 00:18:05,799
But don't worry,
you'll get used to them.

278
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,737
I'm sure I will.

279
00:18:07,773 --> 00:18:09,709
You must be Colonel Kira.

280
00:18:09,744 --> 00:18:11,077
I'm sorry I wasn't
at the airlock

281
00:18:11,114 --> 00:18:12,708
to greet you
when you arrived, but I was...

282
00:18:12,751 --> 00:18:14,220
No need to explain, Colonel.

283
00:18:14,254 --> 00:18:15,553
You must be quite busy.

284
00:18:16,827 --> 00:18:19,697
I hope you find your
accommodations satisfactory

285
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:21,259
other than the chairs,
of course.

286
00:18:21,303 --> 00:18:23,273
I'm sure we'll be
quite comfortable here.

287
00:18:23,307 --> 00:18:26,838
I trust that won't be
a problem for you.

288
00:18:28,051 --> 00:18:29,918
Meaning what?

289
00:18:29,955 --> 00:18:32,426
My people have
a reputation for arrogance.

290
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,795
I'm afraid it's well-earned.

291
00:18:34,832 --> 00:18:37,065
But you're different.

292
00:18:38,841 --> 00:18:41,608
Or so Admiral Ross tells me.

293
00:18:41,647 --> 00:18:43,982
The Admiral and I have
a good working relationship.

294
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:46,616
I hope to have
a similar one with you.

295
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:48,321
I'd like nothing more.

296
00:18:48,362 --> 00:18:50,195
Then I look forward
to working with you

297
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:53,673
toward our common goal...
the destruction of the Dominion.

298
00:19:04,331 --> 00:19:05,698
Worf did this?

299
00:19:05,733 --> 00:19:07,259
With his own two hands.

300
00:19:07,304 --> 00:19:09,639
And it's not the first time
he's busted up the joint.

301
00:19:09,676 --> 00:19:11,168
I don't care
how much he threatens me

302
00:19:11,213 --> 00:19:13,514
that's the last time
I ever sing "All the Way."

303
00:19:13,551 --> 00:19:16,318
If he wants to hear it again,
let him buy a Sinatra album.

304
00:19:16,357 --> 00:19:18,224
"All the Way"?

305
00:19:18,261 --> 00:19:21,393
That was Jadzia's favorite song.

306
00:19:21,435 --> 00:19:22,995
I'm sorry, Vic,
but you're going

307
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:24,028
to have to forgive him.

308
00:19:24,074 --> 00:19:25,543
He's having a hard time
accepting her death.

309
00:19:25,577 --> 00:19:28,481
So am I, but you don't see me
busting up the joint.

310
00:19:28,518 --> 00:19:29,543
She wasn't your wife.

311
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:30,554
She should have been.

312
00:19:30,588 --> 00:19:31,921
There is something wrong.

313
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,655
That's what I've
been telling you.

314
00:19:33,695 --> 00:19:34,685
Klingons usually have

315
00:19:34,731 --> 00:19:36,564
a shorter mourning
period than humans.

316
00:19:36,601 --> 00:19:38,503
They accept death
more readily than we do.

317
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,670
Well, something is
driving Worf cuckoo.

318
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,270
Your buddy needs
some serious help

319
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:43,407
and soon.

320
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:45,419
The band is
threatening to quit.

321
00:19:45,454 --> 00:19:47,083
They can't quit.

322
00:19:47,192 --> 00:19:48,889
They're holograms.

323
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:50,796
They don't know that.

324
00:19:50,832 --> 00:19:52,027
I'll see what I can do.

325
00:19:52,069 --> 00:19:54,302
Hang in there, pally.

326
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,470
I'll try, but I think
Jadzia's death

327
00:19:56,512 --> 00:19:57,845
has made us all a little cuckoo.

328
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,190
Dad?

329
00:20:23,471 --> 00:20:25,532
You should be in bed.

330
00:20:26,979 --> 00:20:29,712
Not until you tell me
what I need to know.

331
00:20:29,752 --> 00:20:31,551
I already told you.

332
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:32,784
She's no one.

333
00:20:32,825 --> 00:20:35,798
You're going to have
to do better than that.

334
00:20:35,831 --> 00:20:38,770
Leave it be, Ben.

335
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,067
I can't.

336
00:20:44,751 --> 00:20:46,050
I saw her.

337
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:50,792
The vision
the Prophets sent me...

338
00:20:50,831 --> 00:20:52,858
she was the woman in the desert.

339
00:20:52,903 --> 00:20:54,896
That's impossible.

340
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,705
I'm telling you, I saw her.

341
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:00,049
You couldn't have.

342
00:21:00,085 --> 00:21:02,750
Dad, please, who is she?

343
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:06,390
I'm sorry, but I don't
want to talk about it.

344
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:07,400
Dad...

345
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:08,402
No.

346
00:21:08,436 --> 00:21:09,563
You have to tell me!

347
00:21:09,606 --> 00:21:12,305
I need to know who she is!

348
00:21:32,256 --> 00:21:33,953
Her name was Sarah.

349
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:39,666
I met her in June of '31.

350
00:21:39,705 --> 00:21:41,869
It was in Jackson Square.

351
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,113
She was, without a doubt

352
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:48,419
the most beautiful woman
I'd ever seen.

353
00:21:51,765 --> 00:21:53,257
Two months later...

354
00:21:57,211 --> 00:21:58,703
we were married.

355
00:22:00,618 --> 00:22:02,383
Married?

356
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:05,258
You had a wife before Mama?

357
00:22:05,294 --> 00:22:08,699
It's a little bit more
complicated than that, Ben.

358
00:22:08,736 --> 00:22:10,672
You see...

359
00:22:10,707 --> 00:22:12,974
Sarah was your mother.

360
00:22:25,171 --> 00:22:28,303
Sarah and I were married
for two years.

361
00:22:28,345 --> 00:22:30,816
She seemed very happy.

362
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:32,912
I certainly was.

363
00:22:34,693 --> 00:22:38,326
Two days
after your first birthday

364
00:22:38,367 --> 00:22:40,132
she disappeared.

365
00:22:40,171 --> 00:22:42,972
What do you mean,
she disappeared?

366
00:22:43,011 --> 00:22:45,950
She left me.

367
00:22:45,984 --> 00:22:49,116
Why?

368
00:22:49,158 --> 00:22:53,293
I've asked myself that
question a thousand times.

369
00:22:53,334 --> 00:22:55,965
I never did come
up with the answer.

370
00:22:56,006 --> 00:22:58,807
And you never found out
what happened to her?

371
00:22:58,846 --> 00:23:00,543
It took me three years

372
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:01,882
but I found out.

373
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,582
She was living in Australia

374
00:23:03,623 --> 00:23:05,593
working as a holo-photographer.

375
00:23:05,628 --> 00:23:07,222
Well, I have to speak with her.

376
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,756
You can't.

377
00:23:08,801 --> 00:23:10,600
Damn it, Dad, I have to.

378
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,940
She's dead.

379
00:23:12,977 --> 00:23:16,678
She died
in a hovercraft accident

380
00:23:16,718 --> 00:23:19,519
about a month
before I tracked her down.

381
00:23:19,557 --> 00:23:21,858
I loved that woman...

382
00:23:21,896 --> 00:23:24,527
and-and she loved me.

383
00:23:24,568 --> 00:23:26,629
I-I know she did.

384
00:23:26,674 --> 00:23:29,875
Why didn't you tell me
about her?

385
00:23:29,914 --> 00:23:32,351
I wanted to, many times

386
00:23:32,386 --> 00:23:35,757
but you were so young
when she left.

387
00:23:35,794 --> 00:23:37,161
I grew up.

388
00:23:37,197 --> 00:23:40,602
I thought that might
make it easier, but it didn't.

389
00:23:40,638 --> 00:23:42,164
That's no excuse.

390
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:43,403
I know.

391
00:23:43,477 --> 00:23:45,778
I-I'm sorry, but you see

392
00:23:45,816 --> 00:23:49,017
you and your stepmother
were so close.

393
00:23:49,056 --> 00:23:53,327
She... made you laugh
like nobody else

394
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:57,170
and I didn't want anything
to get in the way of that.

395
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:59,304
I loved Mama.

396
00:23:59,345 --> 00:24:00,768
Nothing would've changed that.

397
00:24:00,901 --> 00:24:03,464
She said the same thing.

398
00:24:03,507 --> 00:24:06,206
You should've listened to her.

399
00:24:08,351 --> 00:24:10,321
Life is full of choices.

400
00:24:10,355 --> 00:24:13,225
You make them and
hope for the best.

401
00:24:13,262 --> 00:24:15,323
Sometimes you're right, and...

402
00:24:15,366 --> 00:24:18,828
sometimes you're not.

403
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:22,508
I made a mistake.

404
00:24:24,721 --> 00:24:27,022
Yeah...

405
00:24:27,058 --> 00:24:29,256
you did.

406
00:24:40,087 --> 00:24:42,820
I-I... I still don't understand

407
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:46,892
why the Prophets would send you
a vision of Sarah.

408
00:24:47,002 --> 00:24:50,533
I came back here
to clear my head

409
00:24:50,577 --> 00:24:54,575
to try to figure out
what to do next.

410
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:58,924
Maybe learning the truth
about my mother

411
00:24:58,996 --> 00:25:02,663
is the first step
of this journey.

412
00:25:02,704 --> 00:25:04,674
Well, from here on out

413
00:25:04,708 --> 00:25:07,772
I hope the Prophets keep
their noses out of my business.

414
00:25:09,585 --> 00:25:12,455
Are there any other secrets
I should know about?

415
00:25:14,797 --> 00:25:19,968
Just my gumbo recipe,
but I'm taking that to my grave.

416
00:25:45,164 --> 00:25:46,463
Colonel...

417
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,470
I was just coming to see you.

418
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:51,507
What is it?

419
00:25:51,545 --> 00:25:52,980
Nothing. I...

420
00:25:53,047 --> 00:25:56,020
I just never thought I'd see
a Romulan eating a <i>jumja</i> stick.

421
00:25:57,591 --> 00:25:59,789
I was... curious.

422
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,459
And?

423
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,942
It has a... distinct flavor.

424
00:26:06,009 --> 00:26:07,478
Personally, I can't stand them...
too sweet.

425
00:26:07,513 --> 00:26:08,481
Then you should try

426
00:26:08,515 --> 00:26:11,488
a Romulan <i>osol</i> twist...
very tart.

427
00:26:11,522 --> 00:26:13,151
I'll do that.

428
00:26:13,192 --> 00:26:15,823
I wanted to let you know
that a squadron of warbirds

429
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:18,861
will be arriving at the station
tomorrow morning for refitting.

430
00:26:18,904 --> 00:26:20,203
I'll tell Chief O'Brien

431
00:26:20,241 --> 00:26:22,211
to start replicating
Romulan system modules.

432
00:26:22,245 --> 00:26:23,714
Excellent.

433
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,242
I had no idea Bajorans
were so efficient.

434
00:26:26,287 --> 00:26:29,727
Coming from a Romulan,
that's quite a compliment.

435
00:26:29,761 --> 00:26:30,990
Oh, one more thing.

436
00:26:31,064 --> 00:26:34,128
It's about Bajor's fourth moon.

437
00:26:34,172 --> 00:26:35,471
Derna.

438
00:26:35,507 --> 00:26:36,976
It's uninhabited, correct?

439
00:26:37,011 --> 00:26:38,412
Last time I checked.

440
00:26:38,447 --> 00:26:40,383
Do you think
your government would allow us

441
00:26:40,418 --> 00:26:42,251
to set up a hospital
facility there?

442
00:26:42,289 --> 00:26:43,918
Too many of our wounded
are dying

443
00:26:43,959 --> 00:26:45,826
on the long journey
back to Romulus.

444
00:26:45,864 --> 00:26:47,629
I'll ask
the Council of Ministers.

445
00:26:47,668 --> 00:26:50,037
I'd appreciate anything
you can do.

446
00:26:55,551 --> 00:26:56,986
You've got to get him talking

447
00:26:57,021 --> 00:26:58,456
but whatever you do,
don't mention Jadzia.

448
00:26:58,491 --> 00:26:59,550
Let him do that.

449
00:26:59,594 --> 00:27:01,291
I don't think Worf wants
to talk about her.

450
00:27:01,331 --> 00:27:04,327
Well, he may not want to,
but he needs to, I think

451
00:27:04,371 --> 00:27:06,341
and given the right
circumstances, he will.

452
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:08,106
Well, we have one circumstance
in our favor.

453
00:27:08,145 --> 00:27:10,981
2301... a very good year
for bloodwine.

454
00:27:11,019 --> 00:27:12,112
I'll let you do your work.

455
00:27:12,154 --> 00:27:13,589
You sure one bottle's
going to be enough?

456
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:15,185
Good-bye, Julian.

457
00:27:20,907 --> 00:27:21,875
Chief.

458
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:22,877
Can I come in?

459
00:27:22,911 --> 00:27:24,505
Why?

460
00:27:24,548 --> 00:27:26,347
Well, because it's
been a long time

461
00:27:26,386 --> 00:27:27,912
since we shared one of these.

462
00:27:30,428 --> 00:27:31,988
Got any glasses?

463
00:27:32,032 --> 00:27:34,002
None that are clean.

464
00:27:34,036 --> 00:27:36,439
Well, who needs glasses, eh?

465
00:27:36,474 --> 00:27:38,535
Cheers.

466
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:42,075
Mmm.

467
00:27:42,187 --> 00:27:43,486
Warm the cockles.

468
00:27:49,303 --> 00:27:50,602
Very smooth.

469
00:27:50,639 --> 00:27:51,607
Good night, Chief.

470
00:27:51,642 --> 00:27:53,840
Well, hold on.
You call that a visit?

471
00:27:53,879 --> 00:27:54,869
I enjoyed it.

472
00:27:54,915 --> 00:27:56,680
Come on, Worf.
I came to talk.

473
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,847
About what?

474
00:27:57,888 --> 00:27:59,653
Anything you want.

475
00:27:59,692 --> 00:28:03,223
Old friends, the <i>Enterprise...</i>

476
00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:05,202
Remember what's his name?

477
00:28:05,238 --> 00:28:07,368
Ah, eh, Lieutenant Barclay?

478
00:28:07,409 --> 00:28:09,174
Who can forget him?

479
00:28:10,683 --> 00:28:13,348
Those holosuite
programs of his, huh?

480
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:16,089
Three Musketeers.

481
00:28:16,129 --> 00:28:20,936
Yeah... Geordi waving
that sword around.

482
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,322
Oh...

483
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:38,140
That's better.

484
00:28:38,243 --> 00:28:39,872
So, what did you find out?

485
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:43,418
That you should never try
to match drinks with a Klingon.

486
00:28:43,456 --> 00:28:46,155
Yeah, yeah, but what did
you and Worf talk about?

487
00:28:46,195 --> 00:28:47,163
What do you care?

488
00:28:47,263 --> 00:28:48,926
Because some day
that crazy Klingon

489
00:28:48,967 --> 00:28:51,302
may get tired of smashing
up a holosuite bar

490
00:28:51,339 --> 00:28:53,572
and decide to come down here
and smash up a real one.

491
00:28:53,611 --> 00:28:55,547
What did you talk about?

492
00:28:55,582 --> 00:28:56,915
A lot of things.

493
00:28:56,952 --> 00:28:59,389
His son, Alexander...

494
00:28:59,424 --> 00:29:00,859
growing up in Russia...

495
00:29:00,894 --> 00:29:03,593
the proper way to eat <i>gagh.</i>

496
00:29:03,633 --> 00:29:06,503
But what does any of that
have to do with Jadzia?

497
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:08,008
Nothing.

498
00:29:08,042 --> 00:29:10,536
It wasn't until about 0400

499
00:29:10,581 --> 00:29:12,848
when we were polishing off
the third bottle of bloodwine

500
00:29:12,887 --> 00:29:14,686
that he even mentioned Jadzia.

501
00:29:14,724 --> 00:29:16,922
You know, this could
be a little sweeter.

502
00:29:16,962 --> 00:29:20,129
Miles, what did he say
about her?

503
00:29:20,169 --> 00:29:22,265
She's not in <i>Sto-Vo-Kor.</i>

504
00:29:22,307 --> 00:29:24,368
You mean Klingon heaven?

505
00:29:24,412 --> 00:29:26,177
What would she be doing there?

506
00:29:26,216 --> 00:29:27,515
She wasn't a Klingon.

507
00:29:27,553 --> 00:29:29,956
As far as Worf is concerned,
she was.

508
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:32,120
Well, she did join
the House of Martok.

509
00:29:32,162 --> 00:29:35,032
Then what makes him think
she's not in <i>Sto-Vo-Kor?</i>

510
00:29:35,069 --> 00:29:37,870
Well, for one thing

511
00:29:37,908 --> 00:29:40,436
she never ate the heart
of one of her enemies.

512
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,473
She always was
a little squeamish.

513
00:29:42,518 --> 00:29:46,357
And secondly, she didn't die
in glorious battle.

514
00:29:46,393 --> 00:29:48,591
You mean being murdered
by a Pah-wraith

515
00:29:48,632 --> 00:29:50,397
in cold blood doesn't count?

516
00:29:50,436 --> 00:29:53,135
Do you want to know
what's bothering Worf or not?

517
00:29:53,175 --> 00:29:55,373
There's more?

518
00:29:55,413 --> 00:29:57,042
Well, apparently there is a way

519
00:29:57,084 --> 00:30:00,580
for Worf to ensure that Jadzia
gets into <i>Sto-Vo-Kor.</i>

520
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:03,689
He has to win
a great battle in her name.

521
00:30:03,732 --> 00:30:06,033
Well, I could let him
beat me at <i>tongo.</i>

522
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,265
Not good enough.

523
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:08,706
Unless he has to carve his way

524
00:30:08,743 --> 00:30:11,510
through a hundred Jem'Hadar
to get to the table.

525
00:30:11,548 --> 00:30:12,812
Why does everything
with Klingons

526
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:14,287
have to involve bloodshed?

527
00:30:14,322 --> 00:30:16,953
No wonder he's so frustrated
with convoy duty.

528
00:30:16,994 --> 00:30:18,623
Maybe we should talk
to Admiral Ross.

529
00:30:18,665 --> 00:30:20,966
Oh, yeah, I can see it now.

530
00:30:21,003 --> 00:30:24,306
"Admiral, could you please
send the <i>Defiant</i>

531
00:30:24,377 --> 00:30:26,313
"on the most dangerous mission
you can think of?

532
00:30:26,415 --> 00:30:28,408
Jadzia needs to get
into <i>Sto-Vo-Kor. "

533
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:29,717
Sounds good to me.

534
00:30:29,755 --> 00:30:31,156
Then you ask him.

535
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,531
What about General Martok?

536
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:39,337
He's due to arrive
on the station tomorrow morning.

537
00:30:39,444 --> 00:30:40,639
Good thinking.

538
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:42,615
Who better than a Klingon
to help a Klingon?

539
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:53,640
It's a beautiful night,
isn't it?

540
00:30:53,675 --> 00:30:56,203
I'm sure you're right.

541
00:30:56,247 --> 00:30:59,687
You thinking about Sarah?

542
00:30:59,721 --> 00:31:03,456
Actually, I was
thinking about Jadzia.

543
00:31:03,497 --> 00:31:08,099
She always used to be here
to help me sort things out.

544
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,338
I miss her.

545
00:31:10,411 --> 00:31:13,008
I know you do.

546
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:17,549
I came out to give you this.

547
00:31:17,593 --> 00:31:19,723
It was Sarah's.

548
00:31:19,765 --> 00:31:22,236
I want you to have it.

549
00:31:22,271 --> 00:31:25,267
I think she would've, too.

550
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,469
Thanks, Dad.

551
00:31:36,602 --> 00:31:39,803
There's some kind
of writing on the back.

552
00:31:52,772 --> 00:31:53,831
What's the matter?

553
00:31:53,874 --> 00:31:55,138
This writing...

554
00:31:55,176 --> 00:31:57,579
it's... ancient Bajoran.

555
00:31:57,615 --> 00:32:00,314
What does it say?

556
00:32:00,355 --> 00:32:02,519
I don't know

557
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,463
but I intend to find out.

558
00:32:13,751 --> 00:32:14,980
I still don't understand

559
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:18,152
why Sarah would have a locket
with Bajoran writing on it.

560
00:32:18,194 --> 00:32:21,463
I don't recall her ever
mentioning Bajor to me.

561
00:32:21,501 --> 00:32:23,403
Maybe she didn't
know it was Bajoran.

562
00:32:23,438 --> 00:32:25,465
Maybe it was a gift
or something.

563
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,414
Finally! Some progress.

564
00:32:28,449 --> 00:32:30,419
What is it?

565
00:32:30,454 --> 00:32:34,259
The inscription... it says,
"Orb of the Emissary."

566
00:32:34,295 --> 00:32:36,664
I never knew there was
an Orb of the Emissary.

567
00:32:36,701 --> 00:32:38,364
I've never heard of it, either.

568
00:32:38,405 --> 00:32:39,738
At least,
there's no mention of it

569
00:32:39,775 --> 00:32:41,802
in the ancient Bajoran texts.

570
00:32:41,845 --> 00:32:44,282
Sounds like you've
reached a dead end.

571
00:32:44,317 --> 00:32:45,718
Not necessarily.

572
00:32:45,754 --> 00:32:47,451
What if the Orb does exist?

573
00:32:47,491 --> 00:32:49,826
What if it didn't go dark
like all the others

574
00:32:49,863 --> 00:32:51,765
when the wormhole disappeared?

575
00:32:51,801 --> 00:32:53,668
If you can find it

576
00:32:53,706 --> 00:32:56,234
maybe you can find a way
to contact the Prophets.

577
00:32:56,278 --> 00:32:58,408
Oh, I'm going to find it.

578
00:32:58,449 --> 00:33:00,078
But it could be anywhere.

579
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:01,815
Where do you begin to look?

580
00:33:01,856 --> 00:33:03,120
Tyree.

581
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:04,594
Why there?

582
00:33:04,629 --> 00:33:06,531
Because that's where I was

583
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:09,904
in the vision
the Prophets sent me.

584
00:33:16,188 --> 00:33:18,785
Are these the latest
casualty reports?

585
00:33:18,827 --> 00:33:21,390
From the Dominion counterattack
in the Chin'toka system.

586
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:24,269
I'm afraid that your people took
the brunt of the assault.

587
00:33:24,305 --> 00:33:27,004
What matters is that
we held our position.

588
00:33:29,818 --> 00:33:32,848
As for our casualties,
at least we now have

589
00:33:32,892 --> 00:33:35,728
the hospital complex on Derna
to care for the wounded

590
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:38,327
and we have you
to thank, Colonel.

591
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:39,839
Oh no, all I did was
put in your request

592
00:33:39,873 --> 00:33:40,898
to the Council of Ministers.

593
00:33:40,942 --> 00:33:41,910
They made the decision.

594
00:33:41,944 --> 00:33:44,108
Under your advisement,
I'm sure.

595
00:33:44,216 --> 00:33:46,585
All of Romulus owes you
a debt of gratitude.

596
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:49,651
I'll keep that in mind.

597
00:33:59,851 --> 00:34:00,944
Do you have a moment?

598
00:34:00,986 --> 00:34:02,215
I do for you.

599
00:34:02,256 --> 00:34:04,955
This morning,
a Starfleet transport

600
00:34:04,995 --> 00:34:07,022
filled with wounded
was denied permission

601
00:34:07,067 --> 00:34:10,336
to dock at the Romulan
hospital complex on Derna.

602
00:34:10,373 --> 00:34:12,400
Well, the hospital
may not be equipped

603
00:34:12,445 --> 00:34:13,880
to treat other species.

604
00:34:13,915 --> 00:34:15,908
I thought the same thing myself

605
00:34:15,952 --> 00:34:19,483
until I noticed that most
of the wounded were Vulcans.

606
00:34:22,032 --> 00:34:26,133
Vulcans and Romulans
share a common physiology.

607
00:34:26,242 --> 00:34:28,577
And a mutual distrust
of one another.

608
00:34:28,613 --> 00:34:29,706
That doesn't change

609
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,617
just because they're allies
against the Dominion.

610
00:34:31,654 --> 00:34:35,287
True, but how do you explain
these sensor readings?

611
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:39,804
High concentrations
of trilithium isotopes.

612
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:44,041
Which indicates the presence
of Romulan plasma torpedoes.

613
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:46,450
I'll look into it.

614
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,270
Defend yourself, Worf!

615
00:35:05,462 --> 00:35:08,663
So, how do you like convoy duty?

616
00:35:08,701 --> 00:35:09,965
I don't.

617
00:35:11,808 --> 00:35:14,211
Good. I was afraid you
might be getting soft.

618
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:23,426
I need a First Officer
for a dangerous mission.

619
00:35:23,467 --> 00:35:25,597
How dangerous?

620
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:29,637
Dangerous enough to assure
Jadzia a place in <i>Sto-Vo-Kor.</i>

621
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:43,567
In that case, you have found
your First Officer.

622
00:35:43,611 --> 00:35:46,048
Excellent.

623
00:35:50,126 --> 00:35:52,927
It will be a great victory.

624
00:35:52,965 --> 00:35:55,732
I will make sure of it.

625
00:36:00,348 --> 00:36:02,409
How many clams you
think you've cleaned

626
00:36:02,453 --> 00:36:03,421
since we got here?

627
00:36:03,455 --> 00:36:05,619
A lot. That was going
to be my last batch

628
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,027
but then I got to thinking.

629
00:36:07,063 --> 00:36:09,227
Maybe I'll take a couple
of sacks along with me

630
00:36:09,268 --> 00:36:10,760
tomorrow on the runabout.

631
00:36:10,805 --> 00:36:13,242
Give me something to do
on the way to Tyree.

632
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,184
You're kidding, right?

633
00:36:17,219 --> 00:36:18,688
Jake...

634
00:36:18,722 --> 00:36:20,555
if I never see another clam...

635
00:36:20,593 --> 00:36:22,256
- It'll be too soon.
...it'll be too soon.

636
00:36:24,468 --> 00:36:26,735
Whoo!

637
00:36:34,758 --> 00:36:37,161
Can I help you?

638
00:36:37,196 --> 00:36:40,169
Emissary, I've come
a long way to see you.

639
00:36:40,203 --> 00:36:43,506
This moment is sacred

640
00:36:43,543 --> 00:36:45,604
one that will be
long remembered.

641
00:36:47,485 --> 00:36:49,318
<i>Meeh rak Dorah Pah-wran.</i>

642
00:36:49,356 --> 00:36:52,523
<i>Ee-toi Velah-slah.</i>

643
00:36:52,563 --> 00:36:54,328
<i>Pah-wran amar...</i>

644
00:36:54,367 --> 00:36:57,932
<i>Pah-wran Evak-too.</i>

645
00:36:57,975 --> 00:36:59,706
That's ancient Bajoran.

646
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:05,088
The Emissary is wise.

647
00:37:07,161 --> 00:37:09,291
Well, thank you, but, uh...

648
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,307
right now, the Emissary
has to get back to work.

649
00:37:13,409 --> 00:37:15,072
Your work is finished.

650
00:37:15,113 --> 00:37:16,946
The Orb you are seeking...

651
00:37:16,983 --> 00:37:18,452
the Orb of the Emissary?

652
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:19,614
What did you say?

653
00:37:28,509 --> 00:37:30,502
You're never going to find it.

654
00:37:38,931 --> 00:37:42,302
Grandpa! Grandpa!

655
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,676
Today's special is
shrimp creole.

656
00:38:01,915 --> 00:38:05,548
Uh, actually,
it's barbecued shrimp.

657
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,459
Excuse me.

658
00:38:08,497 --> 00:38:09,726
Where were you?

659
00:38:09,766 --> 00:38:12,762
They told me you were released
from the hospital two hours ago.

660
00:38:12,806 --> 00:38:14,833
I had to give a report
to Starfleet Security.

661
00:38:14,878 --> 00:38:17,145
And the Bajoran
that attacked you...

662
00:38:17,182 --> 00:38:18,377
who was he?

663
00:38:18,419 --> 00:38:21,824
He was a member of a cult
that worships the Pah-wraith.

664
00:38:21,859 --> 00:38:24,763
They believe that the
disappearance of the Prophets

665
00:38:24,799 --> 00:38:26,895
will herald
a new era for Bajor.

666
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:30,570
I don't suppose I can talk
you out of going to Tyree?

667
00:38:30,611 --> 00:38:32,707
If you're worried
about the cult...

668
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,413
I figure you can handle them.

669
00:38:34,487 --> 00:38:35,888
But if the cult knows

670
00:38:35,924 --> 00:38:38,725
you're looking for
the Orb of the Emissary

671
00:38:38,763 --> 00:38:41,428
chances are the
Pah-wraiths do as well

672
00:38:41,502 --> 00:38:43,939
and that does worry me.

673
00:38:51,721 --> 00:38:53,452
Well, here's to Worf

674
00:38:53,491 --> 00:38:56,156
and the success of his mission.

675
00:38:56,197 --> 00:38:57,461
<i>Qapla'.</i>

676
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,994
I don't see why the two
of you are so happy.

677
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:02,408
An entire Klingon fleet
failed to destroy

678
00:39:02,444 --> 00:39:04,540
the Dominion shipyards
on Monac IV.

679
00:39:04,582 --> 00:39:07,418
What makes you think one
ship will do any better?

680
00:39:07,455 --> 00:39:09,118
The element of surprise.

681
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:12,291
If you ask me, it's not
a mission... it's suicide.

682
00:39:12,332 --> 00:39:14,428
You're beginning
to depress me, Quark.

683
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:16,337
Why? You're not going.

684
00:39:21,787 --> 00:39:23,120
You can't be serious.

685
00:39:23,156 --> 00:39:25,684
I've never been
more serious in my life.

686
00:39:25,728 --> 00:39:28,632
I'm going to help Jadzia
get into <i>Sto-Vo-Kor.</i>

687
00:39:30,472 --> 00:39:33,843
What makes you think she wants
to spend eternity there?

688
00:39:33,879 --> 00:39:35,712
I know I certainly wouldn't.

689
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:38,221
Imagine what it must be like!

690
00:39:38,256 --> 00:39:40,420
Hordes of rampaging Klingons

691
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:43,901
fighting and singing, sweating
and belching.

692
00:39:43,935 --> 00:39:45,564
Sounds like this place
on a Saturday night.

693
00:39:45,605 --> 00:39:48,202
Would you want
to spend eternity here?

694
00:39:48,244 --> 00:39:49,577
You know, that's a good point.

695
00:39:49,614 --> 00:39:53,145
What if Jadzia would prefer
to go to, you know

696
00:39:53,188 --> 00:39:55,090
wherever it is that Trills go
when their time is up?

697
00:39:55,127 --> 00:39:56,687
Miles, you don't understand.

698
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,826
You weren't as close to her
as I was.

699
00:39:58,868 --> 00:40:00,735
This gives me a chance
to honor her memory

700
00:40:00,772 --> 00:40:01,933
and I'm going to take it

701
00:40:01,975 --> 00:40:04,503
and that, my friend,
is my final word on the subject.

702
00:40:05,716 --> 00:40:07,880
Well, you know
what this means, don't you?

703
00:40:07,921 --> 00:40:11,760
Yes... that I am risking my life
for a very dubious cause.

704
00:40:11,797 --> 00:40:13,733
No.

705
00:40:13,767 --> 00:40:16,500
It means, I'm going
to risk my life for a friend

706
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,875
who's risking his life
in a very dubious cause.

707
00:40:18,912 --> 00:40:20,211
You're going with him?

708
00:40:20,248 --> 00:40:23,221
Well, somebody has to make sure
he comes back in one piece.

709
00:40:24,992 --> 00:40:26,985
Miles, I don't know what to say.

710
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,397
I'm touched.

711
00:40:28,433 --> 00:40:30,164
You're both touched.

712
00:40:30,204 --> 00:40:32,903
You want to get Jadzia
into <i>Sto-Vo-Kor?</i>

713
00:40:32,943 --> 00:40:36,405
Fine, fine, I'm all for it

714
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:39,855
but can't you do something
more sensible?

715
00:40:39,891 --> 00:40:43,160
Make a donation in her name,
or bribe someone.

716
00:40:43,198 --> 00:40:45,362
It doesn't work that way, Quark.

717
00:40:49,579 --> 00:40:51,481
Be nice if it did.

718
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,888
Third Fleet has requested

719
00:40:53,922 --> 00:40:55,585
two more attack wings
of Romulan warbirds.

720
00:40:55,626 --> 00:40:56,719
That shouldn't be a problem.

721
00:40:56,762 --> 00:40:57,730
Now, if we...

722
00:40:57,764 --> 00:40:59,290
Senator, I have a message
for you

723
00:40:59,334 --> 00:41:01,133
from the Bajoran
Council of Ministers.

724
00:41:01,172 --> 00:41:02,436
We're in the middle
of a meeting...

725
00:41:02,474 --> 00:41:04,137
Sorry, sir.
This can't wait.

726
00:41:04,178 --> 00:41:07,618
Apparently, we are no
longer welcome on Derna.

727
00:41:07,653 --> 00:41:09,213
They want to close
down the hospital?

728
00:41:09,256 --> 00:41:10,782
No, the hospital
isn't the problem.

729
00:41:10,826 --> 00:41:11,987
Then what is?

730
00:41:12,029 --> 00:41:13,658
The 7,000 plasma torpedoes

731
00:41:13,699 --> 00:41:16,296
the Romulans have
secretly deployed there.

732
00:41:16,338 --> 00:41:18,001
Is this true, Senator?

733
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:21,243
The weapons are
for defensive purposes only.

734
00:41:21,282 --> 00:41:22,876
Well, my government
doesn't agree.

735
00:41:22,919 --> 00:41:24,855
You're to begin
an immediate evacuation.

736
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:26,359
I'm afraid that's impossible.

737
00:41:26,393 --> 00:41:27,452
Let's try to stay calm.

738
00:41:27,496 --> 00:41:29,056
I'm sure we can reach
some sort of compromise.

739
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:30,568
Not this time, Admiral.

740
00:41:30,603 --> 00:41:33,404
My government considers
a Romulan presence on Derna

741
00:41:33,443 --> 00:41:35,072
to be a direct threat to Bajor.

742
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,547
This is ridiculous.

743
00:41:36,582 --> 00:41:38,074
I regret not informing

744
00:41:38,152 --> 00:41:40,088
your government
about our weapon emplacements

745
00:41:40,124 --> 00:41:41,684
but I didn't think
it was necessary.

746
00:41:41,727 --> 00:41:42,786
We're your ally.

747
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:43,957
Then remove the weapons.

748
00:41:43,999 --> 00:41:45,969
That would leave
the hospital unprotected.

749
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:47,496
Bajor will guarantee
its safety.

750
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:50,011
I'm afraid
that's not acceptable.

751
00:41:50,045 --> 00:41:53,712
Either you remove
those weapons, or we will.

752
00:42:06,348 --> 00:42:08,819
See that Gul Yaltar
of the Third Order

753
00:42:08,853 --> 00:42:10,413
receives this immediately.

754
00:42:12,428 --> 00:42:13,897
Have you heard?

755
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:17,029
The Romulans have
taken over a Bajoran moon

756
00:42:17,072 --> 00:42:18,905
and heavily fortified it.

757
00:42:18,942 --> 00:42:22,404
My guess is that the Bajorans
aren't happy about that.

758
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:23,749
Would you be?

759
00:42:23,786 --> 00:42:27,021
This is the sort
of unfortunate situation

760
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,725
that could destroy
an alliance.

761
00:42:29,766 --> 00:42:31,633
That would be a pity.

762
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:35,303
Romulans... they're so
predictably treacherous.

763
00:42:43,162 --> 00:42:44,563
What's going on?

764
00:42:51,247 --> 00:42:53,548
Why is the restaurant closed?

765
00:42:53,585 --> 00:42:56,524
I am going on vacation to Tyree.

766
00:42:56,558 --> 00:42:58,391
We're coming with you, Dad.

767
00:42:58,429 --> 00:43:00,331
Have you both lost your minds?

768
00:43:00,367 --> 00:43:02,770
Apparently, it runs
in the family.

769
00:43:07,649 --> 00:43:10,679
Well, you've obviously
already packed your bags.

770
00:43:10,723 --> 00:43:13,320
Yes, and I even brought
my toothbrush.

771
00:43:16,736 --> 00:43:20,734
Oh, nothing I hate more
than turning away a customer.

772
00:43:20,778 --> 00:43:22,304
I'm sorry. We're closed.

773
00:43:22,348 --> 00:43:23,543
That's all right, Mr. Sisko.

774
00:43:23,585 --> 00:43:27,286
I'm not hungry.
I'm here to see Ben.

775
00:43:27,326 --> 00:43:28,920
Well, you're in luck.

776
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,565
Five more minutes
and he'd have been gone.

777
00:43:38,049 --> 00:43:39,541
Hello, Benjamin.

778
00:43:43,929 --> 00:43:45,193
Do I know you?

779
00:43:45,232 --> 00:43:50,107
It's me... Dax.
