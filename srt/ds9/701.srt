1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:05,172
<i>Last time on</i>
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine...

2
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:07,007
Starfleet has chosen you

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,884
to plan the invasion
of Cardassia.

4
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,274
(<i> grunts</i> )

5
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,779
(<i> gasping</i> )

6
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,242
I managed to save
the Dax symbiont.

7
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:35,703
There was...

8
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:38,205
nothing I could
do for Jadzia.

9
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:42,543
(<i> roaring</i> )

10
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:57,933
Federation soldiers
have landed on Cardassian soil

11
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:00,644
and now you're telling me
the wormhole is<i> gone?</i>

12
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:03,856
And with it, any chance
of getting reinforcements
from the Gamma Quadrant.

13
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:06,775
Why aren't you still here,
Jadzia?

14
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:09,778
I need you to help me
sort things out.

15
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,864
Something's happened
to the Prophets...

16
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:15,075
something that's made them
turn their backs on Bajor

17
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,869
and I'm responsible

18
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:18,996
and I don't know
what to do about it,

19
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:23,834
how to make... it right again.

20
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:27,838
I've failed as the Emissary...

21
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:30,215
and for the first time
in my life,

22
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:33,719
I've failed in my duty
as a Starfleet officer.

23
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,554
The station's
all yours, Major.

24
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:37,389
She'll be here
when you get back.

25
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,561
Let's go home, Jake.

26
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:46,523
<i>And now, the continuation.</i>

27
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,403
(<i> chanting</i> )

28
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,285
ODO:
Colonel.

29
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,370
KIRA:
I wish you'd stop
doing that.

30
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,496
Doing what?

31
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,790
Calling me
by my rank.

32
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,708
I was promoted
two months ago.

33
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,376
Besides, it sounds
so formal.

34
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:10,380
Well, has Admiral Ross--
or should I say "Bill"--

35
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,966
arrived yet?

36
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:14,301
The Admiral's ship
is due in three hours

37
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,887
and I wish I knew
what he wanted
to talk to me about.

38
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,764
Maybe he's bringing
good news.

39
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,223
We could
certainly use it.

40
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,934
Yeah, well, don't get
your hopes up.

41
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:24,561
There was something about
the tone of his voice.

42
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,687
Something ominous?

43
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,272
Something pleasant.

44
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,316
It was like he was going
out of his way to be nice.

45
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,484
I see.

46
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,152
Well, whatever he wants
to tell me,

47
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,737
he knows I'm not
going to like it.

48
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,030
And how can you
be so sure?

49
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,198
(<i> sighs</i> ):
It comes with the job.

50
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,450
Uh-huh.

51
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,660
No, I'm serious.

52
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,120
Sitting in
the Captain's chair,

53
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,663
having that kind
of responsibility--

54
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,081
it focuses you.

55
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,749
Well, I'll take
your word for it.

56
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:50,963
(<i> Bajoran chanting continues)</i>

57
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:52,464
How long have
they been there?

58
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:53,715
Three days.

59
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,092
I remember
when the cult

60
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:57,136
of the Pah-wraiths
used to be a joke.

61
00:02:57,136 --> 00:02:59,596
Now those red armbands are
appearing all over Bajor.

62
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,348
It's like everyone's
gone crazy.

63
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,809
A lot of people feel
abandoned by the Prophets.

64
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:06,103
Believe me, I know
how they feel.

65
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:08,689
It's no excuse
to turn to hate and fear.

66
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:09,940
In times of trouble,

67
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,400
some people find comfort
in hate and fear.

68
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,779
If you like, I can charge
them with loitering

69
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:16,864
and have them removed
from the station.

70
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,074
Ah, what good
would that do?

71
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:24,454
I keep thinking if the
Emissary were<i> here...</i> 
things might be different.

72
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,833
I would've thought
we would've heard
from Captain Sisko by now.

73
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,877
Not a word in
three months.

74
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,795
Nerys...

75
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,757
I realize that things
may seem

76
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,385
bleak at the moment,
but there's always hope.

77
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,014
When did you turn
into an optimist?

78
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,060
Must've been that day
in front of Quark's

79
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,978
when we kissed
for the first time.

80
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,855
Hmm.

81
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,525
That was some
kiss, wasn't it?

82
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,069
Changed my life.

83
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,043
Gentlemen... we are home.

84
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:12,794
Oh, there should be a law
against convoy duty

85
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,379
lasting more than ten days.

86
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,631
I'll say one thing
for guarding convoys--

87
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,426
it's usually a lot safer than
being on the front lines.

88
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,636
Is that the reason you joined
Starfleet, Ensign--

89
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,138
to be safe?

90
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,682
I... I didn't mean that
the way it sounded, sir.

91
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,809
In wartime, it is the duty
of every soldier to fight.

92
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,269
Yes, sir.

93
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,855
The invasion of Cardassia
has ground to a halt

94
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,690
while our casualties
continue to mount.

95
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,902
It is a time for warriors
to do great deeds,

96
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:38,486
to triumph in glorious battles

97
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:42,449
not waste away protecting
a shipment of stem bolts.

98
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:50,498
I hope Commander
Worf doesn't think
I'm afraid to fight.

99
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,418
Relax. Don't take it
so personally.

100
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,796
Worf is just going through
a bad time at the moment.

101
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,672
I think he needs to focus on
something other than Jadzia

102
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,049
and I hate to admit it,

103
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,802
but a little combat duty
might just do the trick.

104
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:05,013
Pretty soon the<i> Defiant</i>
will be going into battle.

105
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,599
Worf will be happy
and the rest of us
will be miserable.

106
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,893
It's not that
I'm afraid to fight.

107
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,645
I just don't want to die.

108
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:12,938
(<i> sighs</i> )

109
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:14,689
I wish Captain Sisko
were here.

110
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,399
So do I, Ensign.

111
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,235
So do I.

112
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,669
JOSEPH:
If I were you,

113
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,838
I'd order
the crawfish étouffée.

114
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:41,258
And if it's good enough for you,
it's good enough for him.

115
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:42,843
(<i> chuckles</i> )

116
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:51,643
I think table five
is ready to order.

117
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:54,104
He's been at that piano
since 7:00 this morning.

118
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,648
The customers
seem to like it.

119
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:57,941
Grandpa...

120
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:00,359
Look, I'm worried, too.

121
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:02,196
But he's got something
to work out.

122
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:04,614
Best we leave
him alone.

123
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,908
We've left him alone
for the past three months.

124
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,367
He said he came here

125
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,870
to figure out a way
to contact the Prophets,

126
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,246
to make things right.

127
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,165
So far, he hasn't even left
the restaurant.

128
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:33,935
(<i> breathing heavily</i> )

129
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,521
(<i> heartbeat thumping</i> )

130
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,958
(<i> wind whistling</i> )

131
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,211
(<i> heartbeat continues</i> )

132
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,224
Dad...

133
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:13,392
what's wrong?

134
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:14,517
Dad?

135
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,563
I had a vision
from the Prophets.

136
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,360
I was on Tyree
in the desert...

137
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,819
digging in the sand.

138
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,990
And I uncovered a face...

139
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,992
the face of a woman.

140
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,745
And?

141
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,374
And that's all.

142
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,334
Who was she?

143
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:42,462
I've never seen her before.

144
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:47,675
But now I know why
I came back here, Jake.

145
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,637
I have to find her.

146
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,474
I have to.

147
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,015
ROSS:
Colonel, I really don't see

148
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,892
anything for you
to be concerned about.

149
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,519
I've met Senator Cretak

150
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,480
and found her to be...
very cooperative.

151
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,691
For a Romulan.

152
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,402
Cretak's a strong supporter
of the Alliance

153
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:11,652
and we're going to need
that kind of support

154
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:12,862
if we're going to win this war.

155
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,030
I wouldn't care
if the Romulans

156
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,449
were the only thing

157
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:17,825
standing between us
and total annihilation.

158
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,077
I would still think twice

159
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,579
before allowing
them to establish

160
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:22,914
a military presence
here on the station.

161
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,541
We're just talking
about a few officers

162
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,000
for the Senator and her staff.

163
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,627
And a contingent
of personal guards--

164
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,212
A dozen people
at most.

165
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,880
Besides, it's just
a temporary arrangement

166
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,382
until the end of the war.

167
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:33,550
And when will that be?

168
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,846
Let's get one thing straight,
Colonel.

169
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,932
I came here
as a courtesy to you.

170
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:43,017
This decision
has already been made.

171
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,852
And I have to live with it.

172
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,396
That's right.

173
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:53,403
You've done a fine job
taking over for Captain Sisko.

174
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:55,530
I'm just keeping
his seat warm.

175
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,493
You still think
he's coming back?

176
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:02,245
Don't you?

177
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,707
I'll be in touch.

178
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:22,516
As you can see, we've halted

179
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,976
the Klingon advance
against Monac IV.

180
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:27,686
We estimate their casualties
to be at least 30 percent.

181
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:30,357
They should've been higher.

182
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,484
Nevertheless,
congratulations, Damar.

183
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:34,861
The enemy remains bottled up
in the Chin'toka system

184
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:38,156
and that's where they'll stay
until we destroy them.

185
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,533
I'd offer you a glass

186
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,700
but I know how much
you dislike<i> kanar.</i>

187
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,371
I'm beginning to think
you like it too much.

188
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:48,667
I wouldn't trust a Cardassian
that didn't enjoy a glass
of<i> kanar</i> every once in a while.

189
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,002
Tell me, Damar,

190
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,128
when you're alone,

191
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,880
do you even bother
with a glass

192
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,883
or do you just drink that swill
directly from the bottle?

193
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,552
Depends on my mood,

194
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:01,971
and right now,
I feel like celebrating.

195
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,016
We owe Gul Dukat
a debt of gratitude.

196
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,562
Unfortunately, I agree.

197
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:12,731
Somehow, releasing that
Pah-wraith into the wormhole

198
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:15,485
has shifted the momentum
of the war into our favor.

199
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,863
You ever wonder
what goes on?

200
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,407
Inside the wormhole,
I mean?

201
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,284
Not really.

202

The Prophets and
the Pah-wraiths

203

locked in some form
of... celestial battle.

204
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,834
It's fascinating.

205
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:35,880
I never realized you had
such a vivid imagination.

206
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,633
There's a lot about
me you don't know.

207
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:40,927
Just remember--

208
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:44,889
too much imagination
can be... dangerous.

211
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,000
are going to Armstrong Park
to listen to some music.

I don't want to forget her face.

That's her, isn't it?

227

She's with Grandpa.

228
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:02,049
I don't understand.

229

Who is she?

230
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,303
Why don't you ask Grandpa?

231
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:07,138
Ask me what?

232
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,228
This woman.

233
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,774
Where'd you get this?

234
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:20,485
I found it last week
when I was cleaning out
the storage room.

235
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,529
I-I meant to ask you about it.

236
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,865
So, who is she, Dad?

237
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:26,866
No one at all.

238
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,242

239
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,410
She's no one at all.

It was not.

Well, if you're looking
for some action,

245
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,332
you've come to
the right place.

246
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,334
What do you say we hit
the crap tables, huh?

247
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,336
Or maybe some blackjack
to get the blood pumping?

248
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,713
Sing the song.

249
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:22,756
I don't think that's
such a good idea.

250
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,173
Sing the song.

251
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:28,094
Come on, pally, why rub
salt in an open wound?

252
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,805
You are a hologram.

253
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:33,140
You are programmed
to do as I say.

254
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,268
Sing the song.

255
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,770
It's your dime.

256
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,271
Park it right there.

257
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,734
And don't say I didn't warn you.

258
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,985

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,051
You couldn't have.

356
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:02,887
Dad, please, who is she?

357
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:06,557
I'm sorry, but I don't
want to talk about it.

358
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:07,516
Dad...

359
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:08,559
No.

360
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,769
You have to tell me!

361
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,271
I need to know who she is!

362
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,960
Her name was Sarah.

363
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,881
I met her
in June of '31.

364
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:41,968
It was in Jackson Square.

365
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:45,387
She was, without a doubt,

366
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,765
the most beautiful woman
I'd ever seen.

367
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:53,479
Two months later...

368
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:58,776
we were married.

369
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,571
Married?

370
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,907
You had a wife before Mama?

371
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:08,035
It's a little bit more
complicated than that, Ben.

372
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:10,163
You see...

373
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:12,539
Sarah<i> was</i> your mother.

374
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:28,264
Sarah and I were married
for two years.

375
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:31,851
She<i> seemed</i> very happy.

376
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,687
I certainly was.

377
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:38,149
Two days after
your first birthday

378
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:41,235
she disappeared.

379
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:44,030
What do you mean,
she disappeared?

380
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,991
She left me.

381
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:50,077
Why?

382
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:54,290
I've asked myself that
question a thousand times.

383
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,917
I never did come
up with the answer.

384
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,670
And you never found out
what happened to her?

385
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,463
It took me
three years

386
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:02,840
but I found out.

387
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,717
She was living
in Australia

388
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,593
working as a
holo-photographer.

389
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,386
Well, I have to speak with her.

390
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:09,805
You can't.

391
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,598
Damn it, Dad, I have to.

392
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,934
She's dead.

393
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:17,897
She died in
a hovercraft
accident

394
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:20,440
about a month before
I tracked her down.

395
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,860
I loved that woman...

396
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,445
and-and she loved me.

397
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,740
I-I know she did.

398
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,617
Why didn't you tell me
about her?

399
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:33,079
I wanted to, many times,

400
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:36,414
but you were so young
when she left.

401
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:38,084
I grew up.

402
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:41,212
I thought that might
make it easier, but it didn't.

403
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:42,963
That's no excuse.

404
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,298
I know.

405
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:46,675
I-I'm sorry, but you see,

406
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,678
you and your stepmother
were so close.

407
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:52,348
She... made
you laugh

408
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:54,058
like nobody else,

409
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:57,937
and I didn't want anything
to get in the way of that.

410
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,106
I loved Mama.

411
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:02,191
Nothing would've changed that.

412
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:04,860
She said the same thing.

413
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,529
You should've listened to her.

414
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,575
Life is full of choices.

415
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:14,494
You make them and
hope for the best.

416
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,622
Sometimes you're right, and...

417
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,249
sometimes you're not.

418
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:23,712
I made a mistake.

419
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,259
Yeah...

420
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:29,843
you did.

421
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:44,150
I-I... I still don't understand

422
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:48,362
why the Prophets would send you
a vision of Sarah.

423
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:51,824
I came back here
to clear my head,

424
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:54,285
to try to figure out
what to do next.

425
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:59,665
Maybe learning the truth
about my mother

426
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:02,126
is the first step
of this journey.

427
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,046
Well, from here on out,

428
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:09,091
I hope the Prophets keep
their noses out of my business.

429
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:13,511
Are there any other secrets
I should know about?

430
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:20,894
Just my gumbo recipe,
but I'm taking that to my grave.

431
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:25,774
(<i> chuckles dryly</i> )

432
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:47,671
Colonel...

433
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,882
I was just coming
to see you.

434
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:52,634
What is it?

435
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,387
Nothing. I...

436
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:57,806
I just never thought I'd see
a Romulan eating a<i> jumjastick.</i>

437
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:00,934
I was... curious.

438
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,811
And?

439
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:07,107
It has a...
distinct flavor.

440
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,942
Personally, I can't
stand them-- too sweet.

441
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:13,113
Then you should try
a Romulan<i> osol</i>
twist-- very tart.

442
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,823
I'll do that.

443
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,493
I wanted to let you know
that a squadron of warbirds

444
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:18,869
will be arriving
at the station

445
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:20,578
tomorrow morning
for refitting.

446
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:21,955
I'll tell Chief O'Brien

447
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,457
to start replicating
Romulan system modules.

448
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,292
Excellent.

449
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,503
I had no idea Bajorans
were so efficient.

450
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:29,880
Coming from a Romulan,
that's quite a compliment.

451
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,591
Oh, one more thing.

452
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:35,469
It's about Bajor's
fourth moon.

453
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:36,512
Derna.

454
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:38,097
It's uninhabited, correct?

455
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:39,515
Last time I checked.

456
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:41,392
Do you think
your government
would allow us

457
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:43,394
to set up a hospital
facility there?

458
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:44,978
Too many of our
wounded are dying

459
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,939
on the long journey
back to Romulus.

460
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,648
I'll ask
the Council of Ministers.

461
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:50,484
I'd appreciate anything
you can do.

462
00:26:56,574 --> 00:26:58,075
You've got to get him talking

463
00:26:58,075 --> 00:26:59,326
but whatever you do,
don't mention Jadzia.

464
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,786
Let him do that.

465
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:02,455
I don't think Worf
<i>wants</i> to talk about her.

466
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:05,583
Well, he may not want to,
but he needs to, I think,

467
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:07,667
and given the right
circumstances, he will.

468
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,378
Well, we have one circumstance
in our favor.

469
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:11,713
2301-- a very good year
for bloodwine.

470
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,257
I'll let you
do your work.

471
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:14,716
You sure one bottle's
going to be enough?

472
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,302
Good-bye, Julian.

473
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:22,766
Chief.

474
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:23,809
Can I come in?

475
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,727
Why?

476
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,521
Well, because it's
been a long time

477
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:28,939
since we shared
one of these.

478
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:33,235
Got any glasses?

479
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:35,112
None that are clean.

480
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:37,531
Well, who needs
glasses, eh?

481
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:39,741
Cheers.

482
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:43,120
Mmm.

483
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,662
Warm the cockles.

484
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:51,378
Very smooth.

485
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,588
Good night, Chief.

486
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,840
Well, hold on. You
call that a visit?

487
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,924
I enjoyed it.

488
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,801
Come on, Worf.
I came to talk.

489
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:58,927
About what?

490
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,554
Anything you want.

491
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:04,433
Old friends,
the<i> Enterprise...</i>

492
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:06,393
Remember what's
his name?

493
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,479
Ah, eh, Lieutenant
Barclay?

494
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:10,147
Who can forget him?

495
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:11,731
(<i> laughing</i> )

496
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:14,443
Those holosuite
programs of his, huh?

497
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:17,321
Three Musketeers.

498
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:20,366
Yeah-- Geordi waving
that sword around.

499
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,743
(<i> laughing</i> )

500
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,505
Oh...

501
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,385
That's better.

502
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:42,221
So, what did
you find out?

503
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,682
That you should never try
to match drinks with a Klingon.

504
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:47,142
Yeah, yeah, but what did
you and Worf talk about?

505
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,352
What do you care?

506
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:49,978
Because some day
that crazy Klingon

507
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,565
may get tired of smashing
up a holosuite bar

508
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:54,650
and decide to come down here
and smash up a real one.

509
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,694
What<i> did</i> you talk about?

510
00:28:56,694 --> 00:28:58,111
A lot of things.

511
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,489
His son, Alexander...

512
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:01,990
growing up in Russia...

513
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,910
the proper way to eat<i> gagh.</i>

514
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,663
But what does any of that
have to do with Jadzia?

515
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:09,164
Nothing.

516
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,833
It wasn't until
about 0400

517
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,960
when we were polishing off
the third bottle of bloodwine

518
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,837
that he even
mentioned Jadzia.

519
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:18,131
You know, this could
be a little sweeter.

520
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,300
Miles, what did he say
about her?

521
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:23,387
She's not in<i> Sto-Vo-Kor.</i>

522
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:25,639
You mean Klingon heaven?

523
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:27,474
What would she
be doing there?

524
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:28,892
She wasn't a Klingon.

525
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:31,103
As far as Worf is concerned,
she was.

526
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,854
Well, she did join
the House of Martok.

527
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:35,857
Then what makes him think
she's<i> not</i> in<i> Sto-Vo-Kor?</i>

528
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:38,611
Well, for one thing,

529
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:41,280
she never ate the heart
of one of her enemies.

530
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,323
She always was
a little squeamish.

531
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:47,160
And secondly, she didn't die
in glorious battle.

532
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,455
You mean being murdered
by a Pah-wraith

533
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:51,206
in cold blood
doesn't count?

534
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:54,000
Do you want to know
what's bothering Worf or not?

535
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,169
There's more?

536
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,755
Well, apparently there is a way

537
00:29:57,755 --> 00:30:01,467
for Worf to ensure that Jadzia
gets into<i> Sto-Vo-Kor.</i>

538
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:04,553
He has to win
a great battle in her name.

539
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:06,888
Well, I could let him
beat me at<i> tongo.</i>

540
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:07,973
Not good enough.

541
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,600
Unless he has
to carve his way

542
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,352
through a hundred Jem'Hadar
to get to the table.

543
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:13,479
Why does everything
with Klingons

544
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:15,147
have to involve
bloodshed?

545
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,775
No wonder he's so frustrated
with convoy duty.

546
00:30:17,775 --> 00:30:19,318
Maybe we should talk
to Admiral Ross.

547
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,654
Oh, yeah, I can see it now.

548
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:25,115
"Admiral, could you please
send the<i> Defiant</i>

549
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:27,117
"on the most dangerous mission
you can think of?

550
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:29,035
Jadzia needs to get
into<i> Sto-Vo-Kor."</i>

551
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,454
Sounds good to me.

552
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:31,830
Then you ask him.

553
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,377
What about General Martok?

554
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:40,046
He's due to arrive
on the station tomorrow morning.

555
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:41,548
Good thinking.

556
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,383
Who better than a Klingon
to help a Klingon?

557
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:54,227
It's a beautiful night,
isn't it?

558
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:56,814
I'm sure you're right.

559
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:00,609
You thinking
about Sarah?

560
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:04,404
Actually, I was
thinking about Jadzia.

561
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:08,992
She always used to be here
to help me sort things out.

562
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,036
I miss her.

563
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:13,747
I know you do.

564
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:18,251
I came out
to give you this.

565
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,462
It was Sarah's.

566
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:23,006
I want you to have it.

567
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:26,009
I think she
would've, too.

568
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:37,855
Thanks, Dad.

569
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:41,024
There's some kind
of writing on the back.

570
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,163
What's the matter?

571
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,540
This writing...

572
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,709
it's... ancient Bajoran.

573
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:01,461
What does
it say?

574
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,756
I don't know,

575
00:32:03,756 --> 00:32:06,800
but I intend to find out.

576
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,727
I still don't understand

577
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:19,730
why Sarah would have a locket
with Bajoran writing on it.

578
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:23,149
I don't recall her ever
mentioning Bajor to me.

579
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:24,984
Maybe she didn't
know it was Bajoran.

580
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:27,237
Maybe it was a gift
or something.

581
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:30,073
Finally! Some progress.

582
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,991
JOSEPH:
What is it?

583
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:35,788
The inscription-- it says,
"Orb of the Emissary."

584
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:38,415
I never knew there was
an Orb of the Emissary.

585
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:39,958
I've never heard
of it, either.

586
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,418
At least, there's
no mention of it

587
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:43,587
in the ancient
Bajoran texts.

588
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:45,964
Sounds like you've
reached a dead end.

589
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,424
Not necessarily.

590
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:49,092
What if the Orb
does exist?

591
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,553
What if it didn't go dark
like all the others

592
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:53,263
when the wormhole
disappeared?

593
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:55,390
If you can find it,

594
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,851
maybe you can find a way
to contact the Prophets.

595
00:32:57,851 --> 00:33:00,145
Oh, I'm going to find it.

596
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:01,772
But it could be anywhere.

597
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:03,482
Where do you begin
to look?

598
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:04,858
Tyree.

599
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:06,359
Why there?

600
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,278
Because that's
where I was

601
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:11,698
in the vision
the Prophets sent me.

602
00:33:17,955 --> 00:33:20,624
CRETAK:
Are these the latest
casualty reports?

603
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:21,959
From the Dominion
counterattack

604
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:23,126
in the Chin'toka system.

605
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,544
I'm afraid that
your people took

606
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:25,879
the brunt of the assault.

607
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:28,715
What matters is that
we held our position.

608
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:34,554
As for our casualties,
at least we now have

609
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:37,474
the hospital complex on Derna
to care for the wounded

610
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:39,977
and we have you
to thank, Colonel.

611
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:41,353
Oh no, all I did was
put in your request

612
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:42,437
to the Council
of Ministers.

613
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:43,689
They made the decision.

614
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:45,816
Under your advisement,
I'm sure.

615
00:33:45,816 --> 00:33:48,151
All of Romulus owes you
a debt of gratitude.

616
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:51,112
I'll keep that in mind.

617
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:02,541
Do you have a moment?

618
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:03,834
I do for you.

619
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:06,712
This morning,
a Starfleet transport

620
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:08,797
filled with wounded
was denied permission

621
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:12,009
to dock at the Romulan
hospital complex on Derna.

622
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:14,135
Well, the hospital
may not be equipped

623
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,595
to treat other species.

624
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,723
I thought the same
thing myself

625
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:21,100
until I noticed that most
of the wounded were Vulcans.

626
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:27,900
Vulcans and Romulans
share a common physiology.

627
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,276
And a mutual distrust
of one another.

628
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:32,905
That doesn't change
just because they're allies
against the Dominion.

629
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:36,408
True, but how do you explain
these sensor readings?

630
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:41,162
High concentrations
of trilithium isotopes.

631
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:45,208
Which indicates the presence
of Romulan plasma torpedoes.

632
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,502
I'll look into it.

633
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:51,048
(<i> grunting</i> )

634
00:34:58,055 --> 00:34:59,264
Defend yourself, Worf!

635
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:09,733
So, how do you
like convoy duty?

636
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:11,192
I don't.

637
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:15,321
Good. I was afraid you
might be getting soft.

638
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,573
(<i> growling</i> )

639
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:24,748
I need a First Officer
for a dangerous mission.

640
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:26,792
How dangerous?

641
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:30,837
Dangerous enough to assure
Jadzia a place in<i> Sto-Vo-Kor.</i>

642
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:44,643
In that case, you have found
your First Officer.

643
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:47,312
Excellent.

644
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:54,069
It will be
a great victory.

645
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:56,863
I will make sure of it.

646
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:01,409
(<i> laughing</i> )

647
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:04,663
How many clams you
think you've cleaned
since we got here?

648
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:06,915
A lot. That was going
to be my last batch,

649
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:08,458
but then I got
to thinking.

650
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:10,502
Maybe I'll take a couple
of sacks along with me

651
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,129
tomorrow on the runabout.

652
00:36:12,129 --> 00:36:14,589
Give me something to do
on the way to Tyree.

653
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,426
You're kidding, right?

654
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,012
Jake...

655
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:21,805
if I never see
another clam...

656
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:23,431
It'll be too soon.
...it'll be too soon.

657
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,725
(<i> both laughing</i> )

658
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:28,020
Whoo!

659
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,355
(<i> whistling</i> )

660
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,571
Can I help you?

661
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:41,407
Emissary, I've come
a long way to see you.

662
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:44,828
This moment is sacred,

663
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:46,245
one that will be
long remembered.

664
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,583
<i>Meeh rak Dorah Pah-wran.</i>

665
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:53,795
<i>Ee-toi Velah-slah.</i>

666
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:55,547
<i>Pah-wran amar...</i>

667
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:58,341
<i>Pah-wran Evak-too.</i>

668
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,927
That's ancient Bajoran.

669
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:05,807
The Emissary is wise.

670
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:10,687
Well, thank you, but, uh...

671
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:14,733
right now, the Emissary
has to get back to work.

672
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,317
Your work is finished.

673
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,153
The Orb you are seeking--

674
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:19,696
the Orb
of the Emissary?

675
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:20,864
What did you say?

676
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,575
(<i> gasps, bowl clatters</i> )

677
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,209
You're never going to find it.

678
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:34,753
(<i> grunts</i> )

679
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:43,720
Grandpa! Grandpa!

680
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:01,654
Today's special
is shrimp creole.

681
00:38:03,073 --> 00:38:06,743
Uh, actually,
it's barbecued shrimp.

682
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:08,286
(<i> door opens</i> )

683
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,746
Excuse me.

684
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:10,747
Where were you?

685
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:12,040
They told me
you were released

686
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,750
from the hospital
two hours ago.

687
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,086
SISKO:
I had to give a report
to Starfleet Security.

688
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:18,130
And the Bajoran
that attacked you--

689
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,714
who was he?

690
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:23,093
He was a member of a cult
that worships the Pah-wraith.

691
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:25,720
They believe that the
disappearance of the Prophets

692
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,140
will herald
a new era for Bajor.

693
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:31,517
I don't suppose I can talk
you out of going to Tyree?

694
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:33,686
If you're worried
about the cult--

695
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,313
I figure you can
handle them.

696
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,773
But if the cult knows

697
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:39,567
you're looking for
the Orb of the Emissary

698
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:42,237
chances are the
Pah-wraiths do as well

699
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:44,781
and that<i> does</i> worry me.

700
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:55,083
Well, here's to Worf

701
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:57,627
and the success
of his mission.

702
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:59,045
<i>Qapla'.</i>

703
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,464
I don't see why
the two of you are so happy.

704
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:04,050
An entire Klingon fleet
failed to destroy

705
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,136
the Dominion shipyards
on Monac IV.

706
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:09,097
What makes you think<i> one</i>
ship will do any better?

707
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:10,932
The element of surprise.

708
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:13,893
If you ask me, it's not
a mission-- it's suicide.

709
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,104
You're beginning
to depress me, Quark.

710
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:17,897
Why? You're not going.

711
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:24,696
You can't be serious.

712
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:27,324
I've never been
more serious in my life.

713
00:39:27,324 --> 00:39:30,035
I'm going to help Jadzia
get into<i> Sto-Vo-Kor.</i>

714
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:35,373
What makes you think she<i> wants</i>
to spend eternity there?

715
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,458
I know I certainly wouldn't.

716
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,878
Imagine what it must be like!

717
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:42,088
Hordes of rampaging Klingons

718
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,299
fighting and singing,
sweating

719
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:45,633
and belching.

720
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,302
Sounds like this place
on a Saturday night.

721
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:49,762
Would you want
to spend eternity here?

722
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,264
You know, that's a good point.

723
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:54,976
What if Jadzia would prefer
to go to, you know,

724
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:56,728
wherever it is that Trills go
when their time is up?

725
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,396
Miles, you don't understand.

726
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,565
You weren't as close to her
as I was.

727
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,234
This gives me a chance
to honor her memory

728
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:03,776
and I'm going to take it

729
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,987
and that, my friend,
is my final word on the subject.

730
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,282
Well, you know
what this means, don't you?

731
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:12,869
Yes-- that I am risking my life
for a very dubious cause.

732
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:14,913
No.

733
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:17,749
It means, I'm going
to risk<i> my</i> life for a friend

734
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:20,293
who's risking his life
in a very dubious cause.

735
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:22,003
You're going with him?

736
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:24,630
Well, somebody has to make sure
he comes back in one piece.

737
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:28,509
Miles, I don't know what to say.

738
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:29,928
I'm touched.

739
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,637
You're<i> both</i> touched.

740
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:34,432
You want to get Jadzia
into<i> Sto-Vo-Kor?</i>

741
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,977
Fine, fine, I'm all for it.

742
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:41,522
But can't you do something
more sensible?

743
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:44,734
Make a donation in her name,
or bribe someone.

744
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:46,861
It doesn't work that way, Quark.

745
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:54,202
Be nice if it did.

746
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:56,537
Third Fleet has requested
two more attack wings
of Romulan warbirds.

747
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:57,663
That shouldn't
be a problem.

748
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:58,873
Now, if we--

749
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,917
Senator, I have
a message for you

750
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:02,585
from the Bajoran
Council of Ministers.

751
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:03,753
We're in the
middle of a meeting--

752
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:05,755
Sorry, sir.
This can't wait.

753
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:09,175
Apparently, we are no
longer welcome on Derna.

754
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,635
They want to close
down the hospital?

755
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:12,178
No, the hospital
isn't the problem.

756
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,346
Then what is?

757
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:15,181
The 7,000
plasma torpedoes

758
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,892
the Romulans have
secretly deployed there.

759
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,727
Is this true, Senator?

760
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:22,605
The weapons are for
defensive purposes only.

761
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,441
Well, my government
doesn't agree.

762
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:26,109
You're to begin
an immediate evacuation.

763
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:27,693
I'm afraid
that's impossible.

764
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:29,112
Let's try to stay calm.

765
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:30,655
I'm sure we can reach
some sort of compromise.

766
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,198
Not this time, Admiral.

767
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:35,076
My government considers
a Romulan presence on Derna

768
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:36,702
to be a direct
threat to Bajor.

769
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:38,079
This is ridiculous.

770
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,872
I regret
not informing

771
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:41,791
your government
about our weapon emplacements,

772
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:43,293
but I didn't think
it was necessary.

773
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:44,294
We're your ally.

774
00:41:44,294 --> 00:41:45,628
Then remove the weapons.

775
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,713
That would leave
the hospital unprotected.

776
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:49,090
Bajor will guarantee
its safety.

777
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,343
I'm afraid that's
not acceptable.

778
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:55,221
Either you remove
those weapons, or we will.

779
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,268
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

780
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:10,236
See that Gul Yaltar
of the Third Order

781
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:11,570
receives this immediately.

782
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:15,700
Have you heard?

783
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,619
The Romulans have
taken over a Bajoran moon

784
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,538
and heavily fortified it.

785
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:24,167
My guess is that
the Bajorans aren't
happy about that.

786
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:25,584
Would you be?

787
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:28,629
This is the sort
of unfortunate situation

788
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:31,590
that could destroy
an alliance.

789
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,468
That would be a pity.

790
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:36,429
Romulans-- they're so
predictably treacherous.

791
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,231
What's going on?

792
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,780
Why is
the restaurant closed?

793
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,658
I am going on
vacation to Tyree.

794
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,618
We're coming
with you, Dad.

795
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,620
Have you both
lost your minds?

796
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:04,040
Apparently, it runs
in the family.

797
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:12,090
Well, you've obviously
already packed your bags.

798
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,675
Yes, and I even brought
my toothbrush.

799
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:18,179
(<i> knock at door</i> )

800
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:22,350
Oh, nothing I hate more
than turning away a customer.

801
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:23,768
I'm sorry. We're closed.

802
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:25,103
That's all right,
Mr. Sisko.

803
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:27,605
I'm not hungry.
I'm here to see Ben.

804
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,815
Well, you're in luck.

805
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:34,862
Five more minutes
and he'd have been gone.

806
00:43:39,576 --> 00:43:41,035
Hello, Benjamin.

807
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:46,541
Do I know you?

808
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,711
It's me... Dax.
