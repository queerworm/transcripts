1
00:00:02,795 --> 00:00:04,755
KIRA:
Definitely Cardassian.

2
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:05,923
And in trouble.

3
00:00:05,965 --> 00:00:07,967
Its engines are
completely disabled.

4
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,760
Open a hailing frequency.

5
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,764
This is Commander Sisko
of Deep Space 9.

6
00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:14,890
Do you need assistance?

7
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,309
DAX:
They're not answering.

8
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:18,477
Their life-support systems

9
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,270
are operating
on reserve power.

10
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:22,105
Better lock on
a tractor beam

11
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,274
and pull them
into Cargo Bay 7.

12
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,819
Tell Mr. O'Brien
to meet me there.

13
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:41,834
Welcome aboard.

14
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:43,002
I'm Benjamin Sisko

15
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,586
Commander of
Deep Space 9.

16
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:46,045
My Chief
of Operations,

17
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,798
Miles O'Brien.

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,842
Do any of you need
medical assistance?

19
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:52,177
I think we're all
fine, considering.

20
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,971
I'm Professor
Natima Lang.

21
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:55,931
These are two
of my students

22
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,516
Rekelen and Hogue.

23
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,226
And what happened
to your ship?

24
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,811
We were caught
in a meteor storm.

25
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:02,354
I'm a decent teacher,
but I'm afraid

26
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,356
I'm not much
of a shuttle pilot.

27
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,775
Do you think you'll be
able to repair our ship?

28
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:08,861
I'll have
to take a look.

29
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:10,111
Excuse me.

30
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:14,282
We'd like to be on our way
as soon as possible.

31
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,868
We know having Cardassians

32
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,412
on a Bajoran station
may cause trouble.

33
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,330
That's the last
thing we want.

34
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:22,541
If anyone can
fix your ship

35
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,125
it is Mr. O'Brien.

36
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:28,047
In the meantime,
you're welcome to stay here.

37
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:29,464
If you stick
to the Promenade,

38
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,633
I'm sure there
won't be any trouble.

39
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,427
BASHIR:
Wait, wait,
wait a second.

40
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,220
Are you telling me
that you agreed

41
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,764
with General Yiri's
decision

42
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:37,765
to execute
his brother?

43
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,516
Of course, I agree.

44
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:43,478
Yiri's brother was a traitor
to the Trelonian government.

45
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,980
The evidence
is all circumstantial.

46
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,941
It all comes down
to a question of loyalty.

47
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,442
My dear Doctor.

48
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:51,236
Yiri had to choose between
protecting his brother

49
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:52,571
and protecting the state.

50
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:53,906
He chose the state.

51
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:56,199
As would I, every time.

52
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,410
Well, I suppose that's
one way of looking at it.

53
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,120
But then again,
before you can be

54
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,497
loyal to another,
you must be loyal to yourself.

55
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:07,502
And who can we thank for those
misguided words of wisdom?

56
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,088
Sarek of Vulcan?

57
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,049
Actually, it was
Bashir of Earth.

58
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:13,675
With sentiments like those,

59
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:17,012
you wouldn't last
for five seconds on Cardassia.

60
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,597
Would you?

61
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:22,309
Fishing again, Doctor?

62
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,227
Well, assuming
you're not a spy...

63
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,312
Assuming?

64
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,022
Then maybe you're an outcast.

65
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:29,942
Or maybe I'm an outcast spy.

66
00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:31,986
Ah, how could you be both?

67
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:34,905
I never said I was either.

68
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:37,282
(<i> sighs</i> )

69
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,874
I heard an interesting
rumor today.

70
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,501
Only one?
I started at least 12.

71
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,544
Rumor has it
that you've managed

72
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,547
to get your hands
on a small cloaking device.

73
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,633
And you believe
everything you hear?

74
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,468
When it's about you, yes.

75
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,554
According to Bajoran law,

76
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,515
such a device would
be highly illegal.

77
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:04,476
If I had one,
which I don't.

78
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,854
I didn't expect
you to admit it.

79
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,397
I'm simply serving notice.

80
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,525
You try to sell it,
and I'll see to it

81
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,401
that you spend
the next 50 years

82
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,696
digging trenches
in a penal colony.

83
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:16,905
I told you.

84
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:20,575
You have nothing
to worry about.

85
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:27,791
(<i> yells</i> )

86
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,292
Excuse me!
Excuse me!

87
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,251
Hey!

88
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,087
Out of my way!
Excuse me!

89
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:33,212
Natima!

90
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,381
Quark!

91
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,716
I knew you'd come--

92
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:39,260
I told you never
to speak to me again.

93
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:44,558
(<i> panting</i> )

94
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,101
Are you all right?

95
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:48,729
All right?

96
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,815
This is the happiest
day of my life.

97
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,695
Natima, wait!

98
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,363
At least let me buy you
and your friends a drink.

99
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:07,034
I could make you
a Samarian Sunset.

100
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:10,453
I don't drink
Samarian Sunsets anymore.

101
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,746
Why not?

102
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,623
Because they
remind me of you.

103
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:16,168
Is this Ferengi
bothering you?

104
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,919
This Ferengi happens to be

105
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,339
Natima's old
and cherished friend.

106
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:21,340
Who are you?

107
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,757
These are my students.

108
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,425
Students?
You don't say?

109
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,387
I'd love to sit in
on one of your classes.

110
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:31,016
What do you teach?
Political ethics.

111
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,934
Her teachings will change
the future of Cardassia.

112
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,435
That's enough, Rekelen.

113
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:41,276
Not at all.

114
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,903
I want to hear more.

115
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:46,656
I always knew Natima
was destined for greatness.

116
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:47,991
Quark.

117
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,117
Just one drink.

118
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,080
It'll be like old times.

119
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,622
It'll never be
like old times.

120
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,875
You're right--
it'll be better.

121
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,877
I'll be right back
with refreshments.

122
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:07,302
ODO:
Your hands
are shaking.

123
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:11,472
So, how well does
this woman know you?

124
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,849
Just enough
to dislike you

125
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:14,726
or well enough
to really hate you?

126
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,062
She used to work
here on the station.

127
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,605
She was a correspondent

128
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:21,149
with the Cardassian
Information Service.

129
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,026
It was before your time.

130
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:26,405
So, which is it--
dislike or hate?

131
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,407
It's none
of your business.

132
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:33,494
But if you have to know,
I was the love of her life.

133
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:38,208
Hmph! Must have been some life.

134
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:41,795
What about<i> our</i> drinks?

135
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:42,796
You want a drink?

136
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,172
The bar's right
over there.

137
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,049
Go ahead.

138
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,055
Your Samarian Sunset.

139
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,189
I said I didn't
drink these anymore.

140
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,150
Because they remind you of me.

141
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:07,154
But since I'm here anyway,
you may as well enjoy yourself.

142
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,239
Besides, it's on the house.

143
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,584
You know,
you're as beautiful as ever.

144
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:25,005
And you're as big
a liar as ever.

145
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,466
You see, just like old times.

146
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:31,345
I've missed you, Natima,
and that's no lie.

147
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,391
You seem to have kept busy.

148
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,309
Oh, yes,

149
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:38,768
I'm very successful.

150
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,562
But as the 223rd Rule
of Acquisition says--

151
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:44,399
Please! I haven't heard
a Rule of Acquisition

152
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:45,484
in seven years

153
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,110
and I don't want
to hear one now.

154
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:50,697
So... how long you going
to be on the station?

155
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,407
Thank you for another

156
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,993
enjoyable lunch, Doctor.

157
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,091
I didn't think
there were any Cardassians

158
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,426
left on this station.

159
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:12,886
He's the only one.
What do we do now?

160
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,221
Is something wrong?

161
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,097
We have to leave
as soon as possible.

162
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,349
Goodbye, Quark.
Thanks for the drink.

163
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,936
But... you didn't touch it.

164
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,233
SISKO:
How are your
repairs coming?

165
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:29,403
The damage is more extensive
than I thought.

166
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:30,611
They were lucky
to escape the attack.

167
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,863
The attack?

168
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,573
They weren't
in any meteor storm.

169
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:36,326
They were hit
by Cardassian disrupters.

170
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:38,119
KIRA:
Well, that doesn't
make any sense.

171
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,538
Why would Cardassians

172
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,498
fire on other
Cardassians?

173
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,791
Maybe you
should ask her.

174
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:48,922
Commander, I hate
to be an imposition

175
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,173
but I need my ship.

176
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,508
That's not possible.

177
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,718
Mr. O'Brien
is still working on it.

178
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,264
Your ship sustained more damage
than we originally thought.

179
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,182
In fact--
You suspect that our ship

180
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:00,641
was damaged
by Cardassian weapons.

181
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,478
You're right, of course.
Professor.

182
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,021
It's all right, Hogue.

183
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,357
I should have told them
the truth in the first place.

184
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,983
Then why didn't you?

185
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:12,070
Because Cardassians
don't involve outsiders

186
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:15,282
in their internal politics,
especially Bajorans.

187
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:20,287
Being shot at by your own people
goes a little beyond politics.

188
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,997
We take our politics
very seriously.

189
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,584
Commander, if I don't
get my students to safety,

190
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,627
they're going to be killed.

191
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:28,878
And if they die,

192
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,173
the future of Cardassia
may die with them.

193
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,394
There are some who believe
that the future of Cardassia

194
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:47,230
should not remain
in the hands of the military.

195
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:48,523
And you're among them?

196
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:49,732
Yes, we are.

197
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,109
Rekelen and Hogue
are two

198
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,320
of the most important leaders
of our movement.

199
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:59,033
Which makes you fugitives.

200
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,328
The military is afraid
to let us speak our minds.

201
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,371
REKELEN:
They've already tried
to kill us once.

202
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,206
They're sure to try again.

203
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,626
Which is why I have to get
them off this station

204
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,419
as soon as possible.

205
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:12,464
I'll dispatch additional work
crews to help repair your ship.

206
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:15,634
We saw another Cardassian
aboard the station, in the bar.

207
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:17,385
Garak.
He saw you?

208
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,304
I'm certain of it.

209
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:23,308
Well, then,
we may have a problem.

210
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,685
Mr. Garak is a bit
of a mystery to us.

211
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,687
I'll assign you
some guest quarters.

212
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:31,899
You'll be safe there
until your ship is ready.

213
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,194
We appreciate
your assistance, Commander.

214
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:43,870
Ah, Mr. Quark.

215
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,246
This is a surprise.

216
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,747
I don't believe
you've ever been

217
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,124
in my establishment before.

218
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,751
You usually don't
frequent mine either.

219
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,171
Though I did see
you in there today.

220
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:56,341
Ah, the replimat
was a little crowded.

221
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,717
So, what brings
you here now?

222
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:02,514
Oh, I just wanted to see
what you were offering.

223
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,725
Ooh, what do you
get for that?

224
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:07,894
Ah ha...

225
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:11,606
17 strips of latinum.

226
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,149
Whoo, I'll tell you what--

227
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:14,234
I'll give you 20.

228
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,610
Twenty!

229
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:19,614
How uncharacteristically
generous for a Ferengi.

230
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,200
Just one businessman
trying to help out another.

231
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,452
I figure we have
to stick together.

232
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:27,455
Well, this is the latest
style on my home world.

233
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:28,707
Do you like it?

234
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm no expert
in Cardassian fashions.

235
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,001
What do you think?

236
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,670
Well, I don't know.

237
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:37,048
It's been so long since
I've had a Cardassian customer.

238
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,550
Then you're in luck.

239
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:42,011
There's some on board
the station right now.

240
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,264
Now, that you mention it,

241
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:49,060
I think your lady friend might
find this style very appealing.

242
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:53,314
You're old friends, aren't you?

243
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:56,943
You're very perceptive...
for a Cardassian.

244
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,946
It would have been hard to miss
the way you were looking at her.

245
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,407
It would have been hard to miss
the way<i> you</i> were looking at her.

246
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:06,369
Personally, I find this style
a bit too radical.

247
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,747
But your friend seems the sort

248
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:11,332
who appreciates
that kind of thing.

249
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,376
Different tastes
for different people.

250
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,253
Nothing wrong with that.
Is there?

251
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,213
Oh, you'd be surprised

252
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:21,050
how detrimental
a poor choice of fashion can be.

253
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:22,302
Take this dress.

254
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,387
It may be all the rage now,

255
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:27,474
but in a very short time,
it can become tiresome--

256
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,516
an affront

257
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,017
to the eyes.

258
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,396
Certain people might even
think it's objectionable.

259
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:34,855
And then...

260
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:40,236
nothing but rags.

261
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:41,696
I see.

262
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:47,243
Mr. Quark, might I offer
you some free advice?

263
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:49,954
As long as I'm under no
obligation to follow it.

264
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,707
I've been in this
business a long time

265
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:55,042
and I know
there's nothing worse

266
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,253
than following
the wrong trend.

267
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,589
Now, you're
a smart fellow,

268
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:03,134
with your own inimitable
sense of style.

269
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:08,181
Perhaps you should mention this
to your lady friend.

270
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:12,519
I'd hate to see her
fall victim to fashion.

271
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,479
Would you like to explain that?

272
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,272
She's chosen
to associate herself

273
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,358
with some rather
flamboyant companions.

274
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,153
It would be a tragedy
if she got in the way

275
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:25,406
when her friends
go out of fashion.

276
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:27,742
If anyone tries
to harm her,

277
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,076
they're going
to have to deal with me.

278
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,787
And what are
you going to do?

279
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:33,914
Shortchange them
at the dabo table?

280
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,298
I think I'll buy
this dress after all.

281
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,466
Ah.

282
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,219
See that it's mended.

283
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:52,225
What is it you want from me?

284
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,727
I know you're in trouble.

285
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:54,769
I want to help you.

286
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,270
I don't want your help.

287
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:59,023
I owe you.
You saved my life.

288
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,358
If you'd turned me over
to the authorities,

289
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,109
I would have been executed.

290
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,653
I admired your courage.

291
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,905
It was a brave thing
you were doing

292
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,824
selling food
to the Bajorans.

293
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:09,950
I thought you
were a man of honor.

294
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,035
I'm a Ferengi.

295
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,161
You should have known better.

296
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,205
You're right. I should have.

297
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,832
Instead...

298
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,878
Can't you even say it?

299
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,381
I can't even think it.

300
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:26,175
Okay, I'll say
it for you.

301
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:27,886
We fell in love,

302
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:32,640
and that month we spent together
was the best time of our lives

303
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:33,892
and you know it.

304
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,102
I think you're confusing
lust with love.

305
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,687
I admit,
I'm capable of that,

306
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:38,855
but not this time.

307
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:40,523
I loved you, Natima.

308
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,233
Then how could you
have betrayed me?

309
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,484
I didn't betray you.

310
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,111
Don't lie to me, Quark.

311
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,196
I know better.

312
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,031
You used
my personal access codes

313
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,992
to authorize payments
for goods you never provided.

314
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,369
So, I took a little money

315
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,872
from the Cardassian
Communication Service.

316
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:57,081
They could afford it.

317
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,583
You stole that money.

318
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,919
I saw a chance for profit,
and I took it.

319
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,503
Maybe that was wrong.
I don't know.

320
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:07,383
But what I really regret
is betraying your trust.

321
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:09,719
That was the worst mistake
of my life.

322
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:12,806
And you'd do it
again in a second.

323
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,724
I believed in you, Quark,

324
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:18,227
but you were using me
like you use everyone.

325
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:19,896
For profit.

326
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:23,190
Then let me make it up to you.
Let me help you.

327
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,317
I ask for nothing
in return.

328
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,443
Nothing?

329
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,069
Except that you stay
with me forever.

330
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:31,616
I can't stay here.

331
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,200
My students need me.

332
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,786
Listen to me, Natima.

333
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,746
You can't leave me, not now.

334
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:39,958
If you don't stay with me,
I'll have to follow you.

335
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:44,295
And I will, wherever you go,
until you agree to take me back.

336
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:47,340
You don't even know
who I am anymore.

337
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:50,009
I'm part
of the Cardassian Underground.

338
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,136
Following me will
only get you killed.

339
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,597
I'll take that chance.

340
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,598
What about the bar?

341
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,641
I don't care
about the bar.

342
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,518
I'll turn it over to Rom.

343
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,936
He'll run it into the ground in
a month, but it doesn't matter.

344
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:02,396
I have to be with you.

345
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,398
It won't work, Quark.

346
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,776
You say you'd do
anything for me.

347
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:09,278
Maybe right now,
you even believe it.

348
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,699
But I know better.

349
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,994
In the end,
you'd only care about yourself.

350
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,500
But I love you.

351
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:23,918
I don't love you.

352
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,881
Uh-huh, now which one
of us is lying?

353
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:30,508
You better go.

354
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,136
All right...

355
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,848
but if there's
anything you need,

356
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,684
anything at all,
I'll be waiting.

357
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,477
It'll be a long wait.

358
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:58,828
Professor Lang's ship
should be ready to go

359
00:17:58,870 --> 00:17:59,787
in about an hour, Commander.

360
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:02,122
Good. I'll let her know.

361
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:05,334
We have a Cardassian warship
approaching, fast.

362
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:06,544
On screen.

363
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:07,545
Hail them,
Lieutenant.

364
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:08,796
DAX:
No response.

365
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,840
They're taking up
an attack posture.

366
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:12,341
They're ignoring us.

367
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:13,968
They're powering up
their forward disrupters.

368
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:14,969
Shields.

369
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,220
Shields up.

370
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,180
Lock on phasers
and photon torpedoes.

371
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,058
Prepare to fire,
if necessary.

372
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,268
GARAK:
Commander...

373
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,817
I think we should talk.

374
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,997
All right, Garak,
do you mind telling me

375
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,750
why a Cardassian warship
is threatening my station?

376
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,251
No one is threatening you.

377
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,879
The Central Command
merely wants to make sure

378
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:51,589
they have your
undivided attention.

379
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:52,799
Well, they have it.

380
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,300
I assume this has
something to do

381
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,094
with Professor Lang
and her students?

382
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,972
"Students" is a rather
benign term for them.

383
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,265
"Terrorists" would
be more accurate.

384
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,893
The Cardassian government
would very much like

385
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:06,270
Hogue and Rekelen
returned home immediately.

386
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,648
They haven't committed
any crimes here.

387
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,441
As long as they're
on my station,

388
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,110
they're free to do
whatever they want.

389
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,862
This is all very
embarrassing, Commander.

390
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:17,448
The Central Command
would hate to see

391
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,241
the Federation pulled

392
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,995
into such an insignificant
and purely internal affair.

393
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,788
I'd hardly call
it insignificant.

394
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,040
Judging by the behavior
of the ship out there,

395
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,667
it appears the Central Command

396
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,628
considers Hogue and Rekelen
to be extremely dangerous.

397
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,130
Not at all.

398
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,380
Annoying perhaps,

399
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:36,050
inconvenient maybe,
but dangerous?

400
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,010
Hardly.

401
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,719
And if they were dangerous,

402
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:41,305
would the Central Command
entrust the situation to me,

403
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,766
a simple tailor?

404
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:47,478
Which only confirms what
I have suspected all along.

405
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,981
You, Mr. Garak,
are no simple tailor.

406
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,024
(<i> laughing</i> )

407
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,525
Oh, really, Commander.

408
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,486
That's another
discussion entirely.

409
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,864
All you really need
to know right now

410
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:01,784
is that the return of Hogue and
Rekelen is in the best interest

411
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,494
of the Cardassian Empire.

412
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:07,123
Or at least in the best interest
of the Cardassian military.

413
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:08,207
Is there a difference?

414
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:09,625
Do you
really expect

415
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:12,211
a Bajoran station
under Federation command

416
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,421
to turn over Cardassian
political refugees

417
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,798
on your say-so?

418
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,218
The ultimate decision
is, of course, yours.

419
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,554
I am simply relaying a message.

420
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,265
Then relay this.

421
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,560
Tell the Central Command

422
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:31,355
if anyone attempts to take
Hogue and Rekelen by force,

423
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:35,151
I will respond in kind.

424
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:37,611
Am I clear, Mr. Garak?

425
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,072
Absolutely.

426
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:41,074
Thank you for your time.

427
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,368
Oh, and if you'd like,

428
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,663
stop by the shop one day.

429
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,289
I have a number of suits

430
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:53,335
that would look
quite flattering on you.

431
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:02,302
Here you go.

432
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,471
Two mugs of<i> kanar,</i>
on the house.

433
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,681
We didn't order these.

434
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:06,807
They're the drinks
I promised you

435
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:08,142
the first time
you came in here.

436
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:09,309
Sorry they
took so long

437
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,895
but things have been
a little hectic.

438
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:11,854
Do you mind?

439
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,480
I'm afraid
that we do.

440
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,691
Professor Lang told us
you couldn't be trusted.

441
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:19,779
Ooh, you Cardassians
do hold grudges.

442
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,363
Seven years ago,

443
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:25,785
Natima and I had some
little, silly lover's quarrel

444
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,453
and... well, all I can say is

445
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:30,581
I'm willing to let
bygones be bygones.

446
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:31,999
But Professor Lang isn't.

447
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,918
I have to say,
I find your loyalty to her

448
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,377
extremely... touching.

449
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,213
There is nothing that
we wouldn't do for her

450
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:38,881
and if she says that
we're not to talk to you

451
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:40,091
we don't talk to you.

452
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:42,551
I understand.
She's your teacher.

453
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:43,636
You're her students.

454
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,263
You have
to listen to her.

455
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,182
So, if you don't
want to talk to the only person

456
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:51,518
who can get you off
this station in one piece,

457
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,772
that's fine with me.

458
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,023
Wait.

459
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,399
You say you can
help us get away?

460
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:01,154
It's possible.

461
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,655
How?

462
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,203
One second.

463
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:31,725
The station Security Chief's
a shape-shifter.

464
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,853
You can never be too careful.

465
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:39,108
I take it you know

466
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:42,320
what a, um, cloaking device is.

467
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,197
Well, I have one.

468
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:46,657
It's not in the best
of condition,

469
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,617
but it'll work
for about 15 minutes.

470
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,536
Long enough to get you
away from here.

471
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:51,704
Sounds expensive.

472
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:52,955
We don't have
much latinum.

473
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:55,041
What we do h-have...
is yours.

474
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,375
Exactly how much latinum
are we talking about--

475
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:58,878
No, forget I said that.

476
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,129
I don't want your money.

477
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:02,589
Consider the cloaking device...
a gift.

478
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,091
I'm surprised.

479
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:06,593
Ferengis aren't known
for their generosity.

480
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:09,805
Oh, we are a deeply
misunderstood race.

481
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:11,515
You may have
saved our lives.

482
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,100
Our movement owes you
a debt of gratitude.

483
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:15,728
And I know exactly
how you can repay me.

484
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,814
You have to convince Natima
to stay here.

485
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:19,940
The Professor

486
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,942
will never agree
to stay behind.

487
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:25,196
No Natima, no cloaking device,

488
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:27,781
and no way off this station.

489
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,367
She won't do it.

490
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:31,077
You'll have
to talk her into it.

491
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:34,997
After all, you're the ones
the Cardassians are after.

492
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,498
He's right.

493
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,459
She shouldn't have to risk
her life for our crimes.

494
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,045
I suppose we
could ask her.

495
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:43,005
Don't ask her; tell her.

496
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:44,340
We will.

497
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:46,217
We'll do our best.

498
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:48,468
I'm sure you will.

499
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:52,472
I shudder to think
what would happen

500
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:56,269
if the military
got its hands on you.

501
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,686
Meet us at our quarters
in an hour.

502
00:23:57,728 --> 00:23:59,437
I'll be there.

503
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:08,572
(<i> door chimes</i> )

504
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,157
Come in.

505
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:16,997
Where are
Rekelen and Hogue?

506
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,082
They're waiting
at the ship.

507
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:19,792
Perfect.

508
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:23,796
I know my quarters may seem
a little crowded at first,

509
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,298
but tomorrow morning,
I'll put in a request

510
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:26,299
for something bigger.

511
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,591
That won't be necessary.

512
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:28,675
All right.

513
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,386
If you want your
own quarters

514
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:32,512
to start out with,
I can arrange that, too.

515
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,265
I mean, I'm not staying.

516
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,268
Now, hold on.

517
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:41,021
Your students and I
have an agreement.

518
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:45,567
They get the
cloaking device

519
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,612
and you stay with me.
That way, everyone's happy.

520
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,072
Quark, you say
you love me.

521
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:52,450
Then give me
that cloaking device

522
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,076
and let me be on my way.

523
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:56,745
And let you disappear
out of my life again?

524
00:24:56,787 --> 00:25:00,416
I'm not part of your life.
But you are.

525
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:02,168
You always have been.

526
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,461
Don't you understand?

527
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:04,753
Since you left me,
not a day goes by

528
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:06,588
that I don't
regret what I did.

529
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,215
And now you're asking
me to lose you again!

530
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:10,884
You lost me
a long time ago.

531
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:15,181
All right, then say it.

532
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,474
Let me hear you say

533
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:18,058
there isn't a spark
of love left in you.

534
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,103
There isn't a spark
of love left in me.

535
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:22,271
I heard that.

536
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:23,230
What?

537
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:24,273
You hesitated.

538
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:26,275
Admit it,
you still care.

539
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:27,443
Quark, I don't
have time for this.

540
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:29,278
Give me that
cloaking device.

541
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,404
I can't.

542
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:34,158
I won't let you go.

543
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,577
Quark.

544
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,955
I didn't want to have
to get it this way,

545
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:41,748
but I need that device.

546
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:45,085
Give it to me.

547
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,212
Now.

548
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:50,132
Or what?

549
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:54,387
You'll shoot me?

550
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:56,847
If I have to.

551
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,684
Then go ahead
and shoot.

552
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:21,621
Quark, Quark?
Are you all right?

553
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,499
You shot me.

554
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:25,709
Well, I didn't mean to.
It was an accident.

555
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,545
I've never fired
a phaser before.

556
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:29,046
I barely touched
the trigger.

557
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,881
Careful.

558
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,716
(<i> groans</i> )

559
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,051
It hurts?

560
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:35,219
Oh, she wants
to know if it hurts.

561
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:36,594
Of course it hurts.

562
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:38,514
It's supposed
to hurt, it's a phaser.

563
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:40,057
I made sure it was
on the first setting.

564
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:41,475
How considerate
of you.

565
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:43,436
Should I get a doctor?

566
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:45,020
It's okay.

567
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:46,855
Maybe if
you rub it.

568
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,859
Oh, Quark, I'm sorry.

569
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:52,445
Really?

570
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:54,405
Yes, for everything,

571
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:56,156
for all those horrible things
I said.

572
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:58,033
You really
didn't mean them?

573
00:26:58,075 --> 00:26:59,493
I love you, Quark.

574
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:03,205
I've always loved you,
even when I hated you.

575
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:13,549
Natima.

576
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:15,342
I've missed you.

577
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:17,010
I missed you so much.

578
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,597
Being with you was
the happiest time of my life.

579
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:21,181
And now we're
together again

580
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:23,434
and we have the rest
of our lives to be happy.

581
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:27,563
I wish it was that easy.

582
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:29,940
But it can be,
if you let it.

583
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:33,319
I'm not the same person
I was seven years ago.

584
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,694
I have responsibilities.

585
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,322
I'll share them with you.

586
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,282
The movement
is my life now.

587
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:40,284
I don't have time
for anything else.

588
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,702
We'll make the time.

589
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,914
You're a woman, Natima.

590
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:47,333
Believe me, I know.

591
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:50,377
And it's not right
for you to be alone.

592
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:52,712
I-I'm not alone, I...

593
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:55,299
I have my students...

594
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:57,468
my dreams for
a better Cardassia.

595
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,886
But are dreams enough?

596
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,889
Can dreams make
you laugh?

597
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,766
Can dreams hold
you close at night?

598
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,810
No!

599
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:09,313
But my life demands
I make certain sacrifices.

600
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:10,772
And you've made them,

601
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:13,150
but it doesn't mean
you can't be happy.

602
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:17,070
We did have fun together,
didn't we?

603
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:20,698
Remember the day I installed
my first holosuite?

604
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,618
I'd never been
in one before.

605
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:26,830
I still have that program,
the Picnic on Rhymus Major.

606
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,541
Two suns in the sky.

607
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:30,000
The sound of the waterfalls.

608
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,878
The whisper of flitterbird
wings over our heads.

609
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:36,089
You painted my face with honey.

610
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:40,302
And a Mordian butterfly
landed on your nose.

611
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:44,723
And a Mordian butterfly
<i>got stuck</i> on my nose.

612
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:50,604
His wings were beating
almost as fast as my heart.

613
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:53,106
Those were good times.

614
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,774
The best.

615
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:58,987
And we can have them back again.

616
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:00,989
I'll give the cloaking
device to your students.

617
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:03,825
Once they're gone,
you'll be safe and
we can be together.

618
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,620
I can't just abandon them.

619
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:08,205
They need me.

620
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,290
I need you.

621
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:14,461
Listen to me, Natima,

622
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:17,631
you've done enough
for the movement.

623
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:19,174
You lit the match.

624
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:20,759
Let them carry the torch.

625
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,261
Or are you saying

626
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,471
that the movement
won't survive without you?

627
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:26,640
Of course it will.
Then let it,

628
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,935
and let us have the
happiness we deserve.

629
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:35,148
You really do love me,
don't you?

630
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:39,278
With all that
I am, Natima...

631
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,405
forever.

632
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,494
Will you stay?

633
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:52,916
Yes, Quark, I'll stay.

634
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,168
You don't know
how I've waited

635
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,878
to hear you say that.

636
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,214
(<i> door chimes</i> )

637
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:02,801
Enter.

638
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,430
Professor Lang.

639
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:08,974
Not now, Odo.

640
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,726
Can't you see
we're busy?

641
00:30:10,768 --> 00:30:13,270
I apologize
for the interruption

642
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:16,607
but I'm afraid, madam,
that you are under arrest.

643
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:17,650
I'm what?

644
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:18,692
On what charge?

645
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:20,235
Commander Sisko
will explain.

646
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:23,029
I'm truly sorry.
Now, hold on...

647
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,783
Quark, it's all right.

648
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:51,266
Commander, would
you please explain

649
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:52,476
what we're
doing here?

650
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:58,732
I'm afraid all of you

651
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:01,276
are to be turned over
to the Cardassian government.

652
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:03,028
You can't do that.

653
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:05,030
I wish I didn't have to,

654
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:07,115
but Cardassia
has offered to release

655
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:08,908
half a dozen Bajoran prisoners

656
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:09,951
in exchange for you.

657
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:12,078
And you've
agreed to this?

658
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,165
The Bajoran Provisional
Government has agreed to it.

659
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,625
A Cardassian transport

660
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:19,961
will deliver the Bajoran
prisoners within five hours.

661
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,921
Commander,
you have no idea

662
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,549
what they'll do to us.

663
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,551
We're the ones
they're after.

664
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,177
At least let
Professor Lang go.

665
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:28,345
SISKO:
I'd like
nothing better,

666
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:29,555
but the Provisional
Government

667
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:32,766
has ordered you all
to be turned over.

668
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:34,893
I'm fighting this
every way I can.

669
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,311
I'm not ready
to give up yet.

670
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:40,440
But in the end,
this is a Bajoran station

671
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:43,318
and I have to abide
by their decision

672
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,363
no matter how much
I disagree with it.

673
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,338
How the mighty
have fallen.

674
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,506
Toran?

675
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:06,717
It's Gul Toran now.

676
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:10,220
They made you a Gul.

677
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,513
I didn't realize the situation

678
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:13,682
on Cardassia had gotten
so desperate.

679
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:16,476
I find your bitterness
extremely gratifying.

680
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,270
I'm glad to see
that you're adjusting

681
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,230
so poorly to exile.

682
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:24,568
Actually, I'm finding
my time here quite illuminating.

683
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,278
Then I don't suppose
you'd be interested

684
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,487
in going home again?

685
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:30,783
Am I to be rewarded

686
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:32,826
for informing
the Central Command

687
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:35,995
about the presence of Hogue
and Rekelen on the station?

688
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,080
Perhaps.

689
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,043
But only after
you see to it

690
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:44,045
that they don't leave
this station alive.

691
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,967
But I suggested
a prisoner exchange

692
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,803
and the
Central Command agreed.

693
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:53,722
I convinced them otherwise.
And they listened to you?

694
00:32:53,764 --> 00:32:57,183
My voice is less tarnished
than yours.

695
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,686
Kill them, and all you do
is create martyrs.

696
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:02,188
You overestimate
their importance.

697
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,524
And how do you
propose to arrange

698
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:06,276
this unfortunate incident?

699
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,278
I'm sure you'll think
of something.

700
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,864
You always did
in the past.

701
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:12,658
Don't you see?

702
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,409
Lang's death
will benefit us both.

703
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:15,911
Unless, of course,

704
00:33:15,953 --> 00:33:20,582
you intend to spend the rest
of your life as a tailor.

705
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:22,000
I see your point.

706
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,586
I knew you would.

707
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:35,973
(<i> door opening</i> )

708
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,433
Odo, we have to talk.

709
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:40,018
I'm busy.
Come back later.

710
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:42,938
Later will be too late.

711
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,943
<i>I, The Jury,</i>
by Mickey Spillane?

712
00:33:47,985 --> 00:33:51,738
Chief O'Brien
loaned it to me.

713
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,282
This better be
important, Quark.

714
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:56,702
It is.

715
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:59,830
Odo, you have to let Natima
and her students go.

716
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:01,331
Do I?

717
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:05,084
Those students could be
the key to a new Cardassia,

718
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:08,171
a Cardassia free
of military rule and oppression.

719
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,673
Now, since when
have you become

720
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:12,551
so interested in
Cardassian politics?

721
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:15,637
A freer, more open society
on Cardassia

722
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,430
would benefit
this entire sector

723
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,225
and it would be great
for business.

724
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:23,436
So, wanting me to free
Natima and those students

725
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:27,024
is strictly a financial
consideration on your part?

726
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:28,525
Now, Odo...

727
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:29,860
don't allow my greed

728
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:32,362
to keep you from doing
the right thing.

729
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,406
I know you better
than you think, Quark.

730
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,658
This isn't about Cardassia,

731
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,035
and for once, it's not
even about profit.

732
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:41,830
This is about
Professor Lang.

733
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:44,290
You're right. It is.

734
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:47,753
Her life is in jeopardy

735
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,547
as long as Rekelen and Hogue
are on the station.

736
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:52,382
Now, why didn't you
tell me that before?

737
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,016
What was I supposed to say?

738
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:02,642
That I love her?

739
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:05,729
That I would do
anything for her?

740
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:08,899
That without her,
my life would be meaningless.

741
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:12,778
Sure, I could say those things,
but what good would it do?

742
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:15,321
How could I expect you
to understand?

743
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,657
You've never had
those feelings.

744
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,200
You don't know what it means

745
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,660
to really care
about another person.

746
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:22,079
You've never been in love.

747
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,414
You've got all the emotions
of a stone.

748
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:30,003
No offense.

749
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:32,798
Go on.

750
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,342
Listen to me, Odo.

751
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:42,015
You do this for me,
and I promise you

752
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:45,184
there'll be no more secrets
between us.

753
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:48,730
I'll tell you about
every underhanded deal,

754
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:53,735
every lying scheme,
every dirty trick

755
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:57,196
my brother Rom's involved in.

756
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:01,451
Well... since you put it
that way,

757
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:03,120
I'm not interested.

758
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:06,915
Okay.

759
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:11,711
Okay, let me put it another way.

760
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:15,423
Do it for me.

761
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:18,093
For you?
That's right.

762
00:36:18,135 --> 00:36:20,386
For all the years
we've known each other

763
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,139
for everything we've
been through together.

764
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,723
You say you know me
better than anyone else.

765
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,183
Well, I know you.

766
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:30,105
Sure, sometimes
we're on opposite sides,

767
00:36:30,147 --> 00:36:32,941
but that doesn't mean
that we aren't close.

768
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:35,360
I never told
you this, Odo,

769
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:37,403
but I consider you
as dear to me

770
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,738
as my brother.

771
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,906
(<i> derisive snort</i> )

772
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:42,200
And I've seen how well
you treat him.

773
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,292
Odo...

774
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,752
look at me.

775
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:55,338
(<i> sighs</i> )

776
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:58,175
Look at me.

777
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,135
I'm on my knees.

778
00:37:00,177 --> 00:37:02,303
I'm begging you.

779
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,056
I don't care why you do it.

780
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:05,348
Pick any reason you want.

781
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:09,019
But please let Natima
and the others go.

782
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,731
All right, I'll do it.

783
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:13,815
You will?

784
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:16,193
But not for you.

785
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,611
Turning Hogue and Rekelen over
to the Cardassians

786
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,113
would mean their deaths.

787
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:22,365
I've read their files,
and nothing they've done

788
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:24,076
warrants that kind
of punishment.

789
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:30,373
I'll free them, Quark,
but only in the name of justice.

790
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:31,666
Justice.

791
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:33,418
That was going to be
my next suggestion.

792
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:40,383
So, you're not really
doing this for me?

793
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:42,219
That's right.

794
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,179
Then I don't owe you
a thing. Thank you!

795
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:46,514
You'll never know
how much this means to me.

796
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:48,892
Let go.

797
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,229
Sorry.

798
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,941
Uh... now, um,
let's hurry

799
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:58,068
before you change your mind.

800
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,652
One question.

801
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,696
How do you expect
Rekelen and Hogue

802
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:03,240
to get past
that war ship?

803
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,282
Uh...

804
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:05,408
Uh-huh...

805
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:08,327
I knew you had
a cloaking device.

806
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:11,164
I always said you were
too smart for me, Odo.

807
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:17,879
NATIMA:
Quark,

808
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:19,005
what are
you doing here?

809
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:20,715
Getting you out.

810
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,430
Thank you.

811
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:31,268
Good luck.

812
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:36,481
I've installed
the cloaking device

813
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:37,899
in the central
engine core.

814
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:39,400
You can activate
it from the Bridge

815
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:40,986
as soon as the mooring
clamps are released.

816
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,196
Then, I suggest you take
your ship to warp eight

817
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:44,906
and don't look back.

818
00:38:47,117 --> 00:38:49,744
Now, please,
make your good-byes brief.

819
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:50,996
Oh, what's the rush?

820
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,000
You've betrayed us.

821
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,336
No.

822
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:03,008
Don't-- I'd hate to ruin
such a... nice suit.

823
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,054
Why are you doing this?

824
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:10,765
Oh, exile tends to wear
a bit thin after a while

825
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:13,726
even with surroundings
as pleasant as these.

826
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:17,647
Fine, take them,
but leave Natima alone.

827
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:19,941
Quark!
No, he's right.

828
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:21,776
We're the fugitives,
not you.

829
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:22,819
You see, they agree with me.

830
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:24,196
Unfortunately,

831
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:27,448
it's not their decision to make,
nor mine.

832
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,702
Professor Lang, however minor
her role in this matter,

833
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,454
has come to the attention
of the Central Command.

834
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,999
Do you think killing us
will change anything?

835
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:38,668
Cardassia is slipping out
of the hands of the military

836
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,212
and nothing you do
will prevent it.

837
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:42,088
Madam, I am not here
to debate you.

838
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:45,591
Garak, if you harm
these people, I'll see to it

839
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,385
that Commander Sisko
prosecutes you

840
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:49,554
to the fullest extent
of the law.

841
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:51,556
Which brings up another issue.

842
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:55,434
Quark, things would have gone
much easier

843
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:56,769
if you'd taken my advice

844
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,938
and not gotten involved
with these people.

845
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:01,941
I was already involved.

846
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:03,693
I know.
A pity, really.

847
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:06,738
Personally,
I rather like you, Quark.

848
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,447
You mean, you're going
to shoot me, too?

849
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:12,327
Before I became a tailor,
I lived by a simple motto:

850
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:16,039
Never let sentiment
get in the way of your work.

851
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:18,541
A bit of a cliché,
but true, nonetheless.

852
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,335
I'll keep that in mind.

853
00:40:20,377 --> 00:40:25,757
Well, then, although I admit
it's against my better judgment,

854
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:29,719
I'm afraid I must carry out the
verdict of the Central Command.

855
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:33,431
But you admit
that they're wrong.

856
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:35,808
Why don't you stand up
for what you believe in?

857
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,977
TORAN:
More to the point,

858
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:39,604
what do you believe in, Garak?

859
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:41,231
What are you doing here, Toran?

860
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:43,816
Making sure that you
carry out your assignment.

861
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:46,778
I suspected that two years
living among the Bajorans

862
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,029
would make you soft.

863
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:49,488
I see
that I was right.

864
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,574
You've never been right
about anything.

865
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:53,285
Now, step aside, Toran,

866
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:55,912
and allow me to finish
this sorry business.

867
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:57,163
I will take over
from here.

868
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,209
Why? So you can take
the credit

869
00:41:01,251 --> 00:41:04,254
and to make sure I remain
in disgrace?

870
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:07,090
I can't believe that
you were once considered clever.

871
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:10,051
Do you think that by completing
this one simple task

872
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:13,846
your reputation will be restored
at Central Command?

873
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:16,474
No, I suppose not.

874
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:18,393
Go back
to your sewing kit...

875
00:41:18,435 --> 00:41:20,019
tailor.

876
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:33,491
Well, some people
should never be promoted.

877
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:36,661
Well, don't just stand there!
Your ship is waiting.

878
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:38,455
I'm going to see to it
that every Ferengi

879
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,998
on this station
shops in your store.

880
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:43,418
Ah, that alone
makes it all worthwhile.

881
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:46,587
You heard the man.
Get moving.

882
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:47,755
Thank you.

883
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:51,217
Both of you.

884
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:53,470
Yes, yes, yes.
Go, go, and quickly.

885
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,221
Keep up the good work.

886
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:16,868
Quark, I've got
to say good-bye.

887
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,786
Oh, just let them go.

888
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:20,413
It'll be less painful that way.

889
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:24,459
No, you don't understand.

890
00:42:24,501 --> 00:42:27,545
I have to say good-bye to you.

891
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,215
I'm going with them.

892
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:32,091
But we had a deal.

893
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:33,968
I can't stay here.

894
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:38,097
Maybe one day I can come back
and we'll be together again

895
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:40,517
but not until my work is done.

896
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,768
So, all I have to do
to get you back

897
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,855
is wait until Cardassia becomes
a free and democratic society?

898
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,153
I promise...

899
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:54,364
I'll make it
worth the wait.

900
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:10,796
I don't suppose
I could come with you.

901
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:14,633
No, it's not your fight.

902
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,844
Besides, I could never
live with myself

903
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:18,846
if something happened to you.

904
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:22,267
I need to know that
you're here, safe.

905
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:25,811
That way, a part of<i> me</i>
will always be safe, too.

906
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:36,864
I love you, Quark.

907
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,201
I always will.

908
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:57,718
I love you, too.

909
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:05,017
I suggest we return
to the Promenade without delay.

910
00:44:06,478 --> 00:44:09,355
You have to tell me.
Why did you do it?

911
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:10,565
Shoot Toran.

912
00:44:10,607 --> 00:44:13,067
Well, why did you let
Professor Lang go?

913
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:15,653
I have no choice.
I love her.

914
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:17,696
And I love Cardassia,

915
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,991
which is why
I had to do what I did.

916
00:44:22,285 --> 00:44:24,912
I don't understand.

917
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:27,081
That's the thing about love.

918
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:29,792
No one really
understands it, do they?
