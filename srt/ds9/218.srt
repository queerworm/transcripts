1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,171
Definitely Cardassian.

2
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:06,265
And in trouble.

3
00:00:06,308 --> 00:00:08,279
Its engines are
completely disabled.

4
00:00:08,313 --> 00:00:10,045
Open a hailing frequency.

5
00:00:10,084 --> 00:00:13,456
This is Commander Sisko
of Deep Space 9.

6
00:00:13,494 --> 00:00:15,192
Do you need assistance?

7
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:16,790
They're not answering.

8
00:00:16,835 --> 00:00:18,772
Their life-support systems

9
00:00:18,807 --> 00:00:20,710
are operating
on reserve power.

10
00:00:20,745 --> 00:00:24,744
Better lock on a tractor beam
and pull them into Cargo Bay 7.

11
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:27,092
Tell Mr. O'Brien
to meet me there.

12
00:00:41,265 --> 00:00:42,234
Welcome aboard.

13
00:00:42,268 --> 00:00:45,036
I'm Benjamin Sisko,
Commander of Deep Space 9.

14
00:00:45,075 --> 00:00:48,277
My Chief of Operations,
Miles O'Brien.

15
00:00:48,317 --> 00:00:50,254
Do any of you need
medical assistance?

16
00:00:50,288 --> 00:00:52,624
I think we're all
fine, considering.

17
00:00:52,661 --> 00:00:54,291
I'm Professor Natima Lang.

18
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,001
These are two of my students,
Rekelen and Hogue.

19
00:00:58,042 --> 00:00:59,602
And what happened to your ship?

20
00:00:59,646 --> 00:01:01,310
We were caught
in a meteor storm.

21
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:03,117
I'm a decent teacher,
but I'm afraid

22
00:01:03,156 --> 00:01:04,786
I'm not much
of a shuttle pilot.

23
00:01:04,827 --> 00:01:07,265
Do you think you'll be
able to repair our ship?

24
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,271
I'll have to take a look.

25
00:01:09,305 --> 00:01:10,935
Excuse me.

26
00:01:10,975 --> 00:01:14,644
We'd like to be on our way
as soon as possible.

27
00:01:14,685 --> 00:01:16,280
We know having Cardassians

28
00:01:16,323 --> 00:01:18,887
on a Bajoran station
may cause trouble.

29
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,833
That's the last thing we want.

30
00:01:20,868 --> 00:01:24,640
If anyone can fix your ship,
it is Mr. O'Brien.

31
00:01:24,678 --> 00:01:27,276
In the meantime,
you're welcome to stay here.

32
00:01:27,318 --> 00:01:29,916
If you stick to the Promenade

33
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:32,123
I'm sure there
won't be any trouble.

34
00:01:32,164 --> 00:01:33,896
Wait, wait, wait a second.

35
00:01:33,935 --> 00:01:35,735
Are you telling me
that you agreed

36
00:01:35,773 --> 00:01:38,507
with General Yiri's decision
to execute his brother?

37
00:01:38,547 --> 00:01:40,107
Of course, I agree.

38
00:01:40,151 --> 00:01:43,957
Yiri's brother was a traitor
to the Trelonian government.

39
00:01:43,995 --> 00:01:45,521
The evidence is
all circumstantial.

40
00:01:45,566 --> 00:01:47,503
It all comes down
to a question of loyalty.

41
00:01:47,538 --> 00:01:49,007
My dear Doctor

42
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:51,707
Yiri had to choose between
protecting his brother

43
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:53,048
and protecting the state.

44
00:01:53,085 --> 00:01:54,384
He chose the state.

45
00:01:54,422 --> 00:01:56,724
As would I, every time.

46
00:01:56,762 --> 00:01:58,892
Well, I suppose that's
one way of looking at it.

47
00:01:58,934 --> 00:02:00,598
But then again,
before you can be

48
00:02:00,638 --> 00:02:03,076
loyal to another, you
must be loyal to yourself.

49
00:02:03,111 --> 00:02:07,988
And who can we thank for those
misguided words of wisdom?

50
00:02:08,024 --> 00:02:09,584
Sarek of Vulcan?

51
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:12,568
Actually, it was
Bashir of Earth.

52
00:02:12,603 --> 00:02:14,335
With sentiments like those

53
00:02:14,374 --> 00:02:17,542
you wouldn't last
for five seconds on Cardassia.

54
00:02:17,582 --> 00:02:19,017
Would you?

55
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,961
Fishing again, Doctor?

56
00:02:22,996 --> 00:02:24,899
Well, assuming
you're not a spy...

57
00:02:24,935 --> 00:02:25,904
Assuming?

58
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,601
Then, maybe you're an outcast.

59
00:02:27,642 --> 00:02:30,410
Or maybe I'm an outcast spy.

60
00:02:30,515 --> 00:02:32,543
Ah, how could you be both?

61
00:02:32,588 --> 00:02:35,494
I never said I was either.

62
00:02:43,482 --> 00:02:45,453
I heard an interesting
rumor today.

63
00:02:45,487 --> 00:02:46,888
Only one?

64
00:02:46,925 --> 00:02:48,121
I started at least 12.

65
00:02:48,162 --> 00:02:50,133
Rumor has it
that you've managed

66
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:53,141
to get your hands
on a small cloaking device.

67
00:02:53,175 --> 00:02:54,805
And you believe
everything you hear?

68
00:02:54,845 --> 00:02:56,907
When it's about you, yes.

69
00:02:56,951 --> 00:02:58,979
According to Bajoran law

70
00:02:59,023 --> 00:03:02,225
such a device would
be highly illegal.

71
00:03:02,264 --> 00:03:05,102
If I had one, which I don't.

72
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:07,441
I didn't expect
you to admit it.

73
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,108
I'm simply serving notice.

74
00:03:09,149 --> 00:03:12,123
You try to sell it,
and I'll see to it

75
00:03:12,157 --> 00:03:14,459
that you spend
the next 50 years

76
00:03:14,497 --> 00:03:16,297
digging trenches
in a penal colony.

77
00:03:16,335 --> 00:03:17,463
I told you.

78
00:03:17,571 --> 00:03:21,104
You have nothing
to worry about.

79
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:29,900
Excuse me!
Excuse me!

80
00:03:29,936 --> 00:03:30,905
Hey!

81
00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:32,705
Out of my way!
Excuse me!

82
00:03:32,744 --> 00:03:33,838
Natima!

83
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,008
Quark!

84
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,451
I knew you'd come...

85
00:03:36,487 --> 00:03:39,825
I told you never
to speak to me again.

86
00:03:44,908 --> 00:03:46,708
Are you all right?

87
00:03:46,746 --> 00:03:48,512
All right?

88
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:52,391
This is the happiest
day of my life.

89
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,240
Natima, wait!

90
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,514
At least let me buy you
and your friends a drink.

91
00:06:03,553 --> 00:06:06,550
I could make you
a Samarian Sunset.

92
00:06:06,594 --> 00:06:09,966
I don't drink
Samarian Sunsets anymore.

93
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:11,336
Why not?

94
00:06:11,373 --> 00:06:13,139
Because they remind me of you.

95
00:06:13,177 --> 00:06:15,706
Is this Ferengi bothering you?

96
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:17,551
This Ferengi happens to be

97
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:19,857
Natima's old
and cherished friend.

98
00:06:19,895 --> 00:06:20,886
Who are you?

99
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:22,298
These are my students.

100
00:06:22,335 --> 00:06:23,999
Students?
You don't say?

101
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:28,312
I'd love to sit in
on one of your classes.

102
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,614
What do you teach?

103
00:06:29,653 --> 00:06:30,622
Political ethics.

104
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,559
Her teachings will change
the future of Cardassia.

105
00:06:32,594 --> 00:06:33,961
That's enough, Rekelen.

106
00:06:39,814 --> 00:06:40,840
Not at all.

107
00:06:40,882 --> 00:06:42,442
I want to hear more.

108
00:06:42,487 --> 00:06:46,259
I always knew Natima
was destined for greatness.

109
00:06:46,297 --> 00:06:47,493
Quark.

110
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,503
Just one drink.

111
00:06:49,605 --> 00:06:51,508
It'll be like old times.

112
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:54,277
It'll never be
like old times.

113
00:06:54,318 --> 00:06:56,517
You're right...
it'll be better.

114
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:59,290
I'll be right back
with refreshments.

115
00:07:03,675 --> 00:07:06,877
Your hands are shaking.

116
00:07:06,917 --> 00:07:11,156
So, how well does
this woman know you?

117
00:07:11,195 --> 00:07:12,494
Just enough to dislike you

118
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,399
or well enough
to really hate you?

119
00:07:14,436 --> 00:07:16,738
She used to work
here on the station.

120
00:07:16,776 --> 00:07:18,245
She was a correspondent

121
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,775
with the Cardassian
Information Service.

122
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,723
It was before your time.

123
00:07:22,758 --> 00:07:26,222
So, which is it...
dislike or hate?

124
00:07:26,267 --> 00:07:28,637
It's none of your business.

125
00:07:28,674 --> 00:07:33,118
But if you have to know,
I was the love of her life.

126
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:37,825
Hmph!
Must have been some life.

127
00:07:38,933 --> 00:07:40,961
What about our drinks?

128
00:07:41,005 --> 00:07:42,304
You want a drink?

129
00:07:42,343 --> 00:07:44,314
The bar's right over there.

130
00:07:44,348 --> 00:07:45,681
Go ahead.

131
00:07:49,327 --> 00:07:51,697
Your Samarian Sunset.

132
00:07:57,715 --> 00:08:00,917
I said I didn't
drink these anymore.

133
00:08:00,957 --> 00:08:02,985
Because they remind you of me.

134
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:06,972
But since I'm here anyway,
you may as well enjoy yourself.

135
00:08:07,006 --> 00:08:08,909
Besides, it's on the house.

136
00:08:19,305 --> 00:08:21,435
You know, you're
as beautiful as ever.

137
00:08:21,477 --> 00:08:24,781
And you're as big
a liar as ever.

138
00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:27,383
You see, just like old times.

139
00:08:27,426 --> 00:08:31,129
I've missed you, Natima,
and that's no lie.

140
00:08:34,544 --> 00:08:36,344
You seem to have kept busy.

141
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:37,352
Oh, yes

142
00:08:37,385 --> 00:08:38,649
I'm very successful.

143
00:08:38,722 --> 00:08:41,992
But as the 223rd Rule
of Acquisition says...

144
00:08:42,031 --> 00:08:44,265
Please! I haven't heard
a Rule of Acquisition

145
00:08:44,303 --> 00:08:45,329
in seven years

146
00:08:45,372 --> 00:08:47,674
and I don't want
to hear one now.

147
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:50,479
So... how long you going
to be on the station?

148
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:54,758
Thank you for another
enjoyable lunch, Doctor.

149
00:09:07,597 --> 00:09:09,397
I didn't think
there were any Cardassians

150
00:09:09,435 --> 00:09:10,665
left on this station.

151
00:09:10,772 --> 00:09:11,671
He's the only one.

152
00:09:11,774 --> 00:09:12,673
What do we do now?

153
00:09:12,777 --> 00:09:14,076
Is something wrong?

154
00:09:14,114 --> 00:09:15,982
We have to leave
as soon as possible.

155
00:09:16,018 --> 00:09:17,921
Goodbye, Quark.
Thanks for the drink.

156
00:09:19,127 --> 00:09:21,725
But... you didn't touch it.

157
00:09:24,441 --> 00:09:26,173
How are your repairs coming?

158
00:09:26,211 --> 00:09:28,479
The damage is more extensive
than I thought.

159
00:09:28,518 --> 00:09:30,455
They were lucky
to escape the attack.

160
00:09:30,489 --> 00:09:31,617
The attack?

161
00:09:31,659 --> 00:09:33,459
They weren't
in any meteor storm.

162
00:09:33,497 --> 00:09:36,299
They were hit
by Cardassian disrupters.

163
00:09:36,338 --> 00:09:37,968
Well, that doesn't
make any sense.

164
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:41,450
Why would Cardassians
fire on other Cardassians?

165
00:09:41,485 --> 00:09:43,615
Maybe you should ask her.

166
00:09:45,863 --> 00:09:48,769
Commander, I hate
to be an imposition

167
00:09:48,871 --> 00:09:50,340
but I need my ship.

168
00:09:50,374 --> 00:09:51,502
That's not possible.

169
00:09:51,544 --> 00:09:53,708
Mr. O'Brien is
still working on it.

170
00:09:53,749 --> 00:09:56,347
Your ship sustained more damage
than we originally thought.

171
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,689
In fact...

172
00:09:57,727 --> 00:09:59,128
You suspect that our ship

173
00:09:59,164 --> 00:10:00,794
was damaged
by Cardassian weapons.

174
00:10:00,835 --> 00:10:02,065
You're right, of course.

175
00:10:02,105 --> 00:10:03,074
Professor.

176
00:10:03,107 --> 00:10:04,201
It's all right, Hogue.

177
00:10:04,244 --> 00:10:06,546
I should have told them
the truth in the first place.

178
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,987
Then why didn't you?

179
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:12,020
Because Cardassians
don't involve outsiders

180
00:10:12,064 --> 00:10:15,300
in their internal politics,
especially Bajorans.

181
00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:19,442
Being shot at by your own people
goes a little beyond politics.

182
00:10:19,484 --> 00:10:22,116
We take our politics
very seriously.

183
00:10:22,157 --> 00:10:25,563
Commander, if I don't
get my students to safety

184
00:10:25,599 --> 00:10:27,627
they're going to be killed.

185
00:10:27,672 --> 00:10:28,868
And if they die

186
00:10:28,908 --> 00:10:32,076
the future of Cardassia
may die with them.

187
00:10:42,777 --> 00:10:45,181
There are some who believe
that the future of Cardassia

188
00:10:45,217 --> 00:10:47,313
should not remain
in the hands of the military.

189
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:49,054
And you're among them?

190
00:10:49,094 --> 00:10:50,063
Yes, we are.

191
00:10:50,096 --> 00:10:51,190
Rekelen and Hogue are two

192
00:10:51,232 --> 00:10:53,294
of the most important leaders
of our movement.

193
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,744
Which makes you fugitives.

194
00:10:57,783 --> 00:11:01,452
The military is afraid
to let us speak our minds.

195
00:11:01,493 --> 00:11:03,464
They've already tried
to kill us once.

196
00:11:03,498 --> 00:11:05,366
They're sure to try again.

197
00:11:05,403 --> 00:11:08,844
Which is why I have to get
them off this station

198
00:11:08,878 --> 00:11:10,347
as soon as possible.

199
00:11:10,382 --> 00:11:13,322
I'll dispatch additional work
crews to help repair your ship.

200
00:11:13,357 --> 00:11:15,795
We saw another Cardassian
aboard the station, in the bar.

201
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,494
Garak.
He saw you?

202
00:11:17,534 --> 00:11:18,764
I'm certain of it.

203
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:22,074
Well, then,
we may have a problem.

204
00:11:22,113 --> 00:11:25,850
Mr. Garak is a bit
of a mystery to us.

205
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:28,886
I'll assign you
some guest quarters.

206
00:11:28,931 --> 00:11:31,061
You'll be safe there
until your ship is ready.

207
00:11:31,102 --> 00:11:34,508
We appreciate
your assistance, Commander.

208
00:11:40,494 --> 00:11:42,556
Ah, Mr. Quark.

209
00:11:42,599 --> 00:11:45,437
This is a surprise.

210
00:11:45,473 --> 00:11:46,965
I don't believe
you've ever been

211
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,343
in my establishment before.

212
00:11:48,381 --> 00:11:50,910
You usually don't
frequent mine either.

213
00:11:50,954 --> 00:11:53,290
Though I did see
you in there today.

214
00:11:53,326 --> 00:11:56,425
Ah, the replimat
was a little crowded.

215
00:11:56,469 --> 00:11:58,839
So, what brings you here now?

216
00:11:58,874 --> 00:12:02,543
Oh, I just wanted to see
what you were offering.

217
00:12:04,055 --> 00:12:06,789
Ooh, what do you get for that?

218
00:12:06,828 --> 00:12:07,956
Ah ha...

219
00:12:07,998 --> 00:12:11,770
17 strips of latinum.

220
00:12:11,808 --> 00:12:13,300
Whoo, I'll tell you what...

221
00:12:13,345 --> 00:12:14,371
I'll give you 20.

222
00:12:14,415 --> 00:12:15,402
Twenty!

223
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:19,443
How uncharacteristically
generous for a Ferengi.

224
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:22,043
Just one businessman
trying to help out another.

225
00:12:22,085 --> 00:12:24,215
I figure we have
to stick together.

226
00:12:24,258 --> 00:12:27,391
Well, this is the latest
style on my home world.

227
00:12:27,433 --> 00:12:28,561
Do you like it?

228
00:12:28,603 --> 00:12:31,007
I'm no expert
in Cardassian fashions.

229
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,102
What do you think?

230
00:12:32,145 --> 00:12:33,546
Well, I don't know.

231
00:12:33,582 --> 00:12:37,023
It's been so long since
I've had a Cardassian customer.

232
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:38,458
Then you're in luck.

233
00:12:38,495 --> 00:12:41,697
There's some on board
the station right now.

234
00:12:41,737 --> 00:12:44,039
Now, that you mention it

235
00:12:44,076 --> 00:12:50,047
I think your lady friend might
find this style very appealing.

236
00:12:50,091 --> 00:12:53,156
You're old friends, aren't you?

237
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:56,697
You're very perceptive...
for a Cardassian.

238
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:59,716
It would have been hard to miss
the way you were looking at her.

239
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,245
It would have been hard to miss
the way you were looking at her.

240
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:06,096
Personally, I find this style
a bit too radical.

241
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:08,537
But your friend seems the sort

242
00:13:08,573 --> 00:13:11,137
who appreciates
that kind of thing.

243
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,174
Different tastes
for different people.

244
00:13:13,218 --> 00:13:15,052
Nothing wrong with that.
Is there?

245
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,993
Oh, you'd be surprised

246
00:13:17,028 --> 00:13:20,765
how detrimental
a poor choice of fashion can be.

247
00:13:20,804 --> 00:13:22,068
Take this dress.

248
00:13:22,108 --> 00:13:24,136
It may be all the rage now

249
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:27,450
but in a very short time
it can become tiresome...

250
00:13:27,489 --> 00:13:29,791
an affront to the eyes.

251
00:13:29,895 --> 00:13:33,097
Certain people might even
think it's objectionable.

252
00:13:33,137 --> 00:13:34,470
And then...

253
00:13:36,746 --> 00:13:39,948
nothing but rags.

254
00:13:39,988 --> 00:13:41,457
I see.

255
00:13:41,491 --> 00:13:47,029
Mr. Quark, might I offer
you some free advice?

256
00:13:47,073 --> 00:13:49,773
As long as I'm under no
obligation to follow it.

257
00:13:49,814 --> 00:13:52,514
I've been in this
business a long time

258
00:13:52,554 --> 00:13:54,822
and I know
there's nothing worse

259
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,094
than following
the wrong trend.

260
00:13:57,132 --> 00:13:59,366
Now, you're a smart fellow

261
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:02,903
with your own inimitable
sense of style.

262
00:14:02,948 --> 00:14:08,019
Perhaps you should mention this
to your lady friend.

263
00:14:08,061 --> 00:14:12,232
I'd hate to see her
fall victim to fashion.

264
00:14:12,271 --> 00:14:14,367
Would you like to explain that?

265
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,074
She's chosen
to associate herself

266
00:14:16,115 --> 00:14:18,143
with some rather
flamboyant companions.

267
00:14:18,187 --> 00:14:21,959
It would be a tragedy
if she got in the way

268
00:14:21,997 --> 00:14:25,267
when her friends
go out of fashion.

269
00:14:25,305 --> 00:14:26,865
If anyone tries to harm her

270
00:14:26,943 --> 00:14:29,245
they're going
to have to deal with me.

271
00:14:29,283 --> 00:14:31,881
And what are you going to do?

272
00:14:31,989 --> 00:14:35,327
Shortchange them
at the dabo table?

273
00:14:40,044 --> 00:14:43,314
I think I'll buy
this dress after all.

274
00:14:43,352 --> 00:14:44,651
Ah.

275
00:14:44,689 --> 00:14:46,249
See that it's mended.

276
00:14:49,568 --> 00:14:51,938
What is it you want from me?

277
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,442
I know you're in trouble.

278
00:14:53,478 --> 00:14:54,572
I want to help you.

279
00:14:54,615 --> 00:14:56,084
I don't want your help.

280
00:14:56,118 --> 00:14:57,417
I owe you.
You saved my life.

281
00:14:57,456 --> 00:15:00,088
If you'd turned me over
to the authorities

282
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:01,861
I would have been executed.

283
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,393
I admired your courage.

284
00:15:03,437 --> 00:15:05,671
It was a brave thing
you were doing

285
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,613
selling food to the Bajorans.

286
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:09,813
I thought you
were a man of honor.

287
00:15:09,854 --> 00:15:10,823
I'm a Ferengi.

288
00:15:10,857 --> 00:15:13,159
You should have known better.

289
00:15:13,196 --> 00:15:15,190
You're right... I should have.

290
00:15:15,235 --> 00:15:17,673
Instead...

291
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,614
Can't you even say it?

292
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:23,178
I can't even think it.

293
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:26,128
Okay, I'll say it for you.

294
00:15:26,163 --> 00:15:27,689
We fell in love

295
00:15:27,734 --> 00:15:32,371
and that month we spent together
was the best time of our lives

296
00:15:32,412 --> 00:15:33,711
and you know it.

297
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,914
I think you're confusing
lust with love.

298
00:15:35,955 --> 00:15:38,621
I admit, I'm capable of that,
but not this time.

299
00:15:38,662 --> 00:15:39,892
I loved you, Natima.

300
00:15:39,932 --> 00:15:42,427
Then how could you
have betrayed me?

301
00:15:42,473 --> 00:15:44,103
I didn't betray you.

302
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:45,578
Don't lie to me, Quark.

303
00:15:45,614 --> 00:15:46,981
I know better.

304
00:15:47,018 --> 00:15:48,852
You used
my personal access codes

305
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:51,829
to authorize payments
for goods you never provided.

306
00:15:51,864 --> 00:15:53,231
So, I took a little money

307
00:15:53,267 --> 00:15:55,637
from the Cardassian
Communication Service.

308
00:15:55,673 --> 00:15:56,835
They could afford it.

309
00:15:56,877 --> 00:15:58,346
You stole that money.

310
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,046
I saw a chance for profit,
and I took it.

311
00:16:01,087 --> 00:16:02,579
Maybe that was wrong.

312
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:03,924
I don't know.

313
00:16:03,961 --> 00:16:07,231
But what I really regret
is betraying your trust.

314
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:10,004
That was the worst mistake
of my life.

315
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:12,573
And you'd do it
again in a second.

316
00:16:12,617 --> 00:16:14,554
I believed in you, Quark

317
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:17,995
but you were using me,
like you use everyone...

318
00:16:18,031 --> 00:16:19,661
for profit.

319
00:16:19,702 --> 00:16:22,938
Then let me make it up to you.
Let me help you.

320
00:16:22,977 --> 00:16:24,037
I ask for nothing in return.

321
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,208
Nothing?

322
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,383
Except that you stay
with me forever.

323
00:16:28,425 --> 00:16:30,863
I can't stay here.

324
00:16:30,898 --> 00:16:32,926
My students need me.

325
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,600
Listen to me, Natima.

326
00:16:34,641 --> 00:16:36,635
You can't leave me, not now.

327
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:40,212
If you don't stay with me,
I'll have to follow you.

328
00:16:40,256 --> 00:16:44,700
And I will... wherever you go...
until you agree to take me back.

329
00:16:44,734 --> 00:16:47,206
You don't even know
who I am anymore.

330
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,838
I'm part of the Cardassian
Underground.

331
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,444
Following me will
only get you killed.

332
00:16:52,487 --> 00:16:54,424
I'll take that chance.

333
00:16:54,459 --> 00:16:55,587
What about the bar?

334
00:16:55,628 --> 00:16:57,120
I don't care about the bar.

335
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,362
I'll turn it over to Rom.

336
00:16:58,403 --> 00:17:01,137
He'll run it into the ground in
a month, but it doesn't matter.

337
00:17:01,176 --> 00:17:02,202
I have to be with you.

338
00:17:02,246 --> 00:17:04,240
It won't work, Quark.

339
00:17:04,284 --> 00:17:07,349
You say you'd do
anything for me.

340
00:17:07,392 --> 00:17:10,764
Maybe right now,
you even believe it.

341
00:17:10,802 --> 00:17:12,534
But I know better.

342
00:17:12,572 --> 00:17:16,571
In the end,
you'd only care about yourself.

343
00:17:20,593 --> 00:17:22,325
But I love you.

344
00:17:22,365 --> 00:17:24,495
I don't love you.

345
00:17:25,974 --> 00:17:28,708
Uh-huh, now which one
of us is lying?

346
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:31,050
You better go.

347
00:17:32,491 --> 00:17:34,051
All right...

348
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:36,727
but if there's
anything you need...

349
00:17:36,769 --> 00:17:39,503
anything at all...
I'll be waiting.

350
00:17:39,543 --> 00:17:42,038
It'll be a long wait.

351
00:17:55,952 --> 00:17:58,220
Professor Lang's ship
should be ready to go

352
00:17:58,325 --> 00:17:59,885
in about an hour, Commander.

353
00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:01,593
Good. I'll let her know.

354
00:18:01,633 --> 00:18:05,097
We have a Cardassian warship
approaching, fast.

355
00:18:05,142 --> 00:18:06,304
On screen.

356
00:18:06,345 --> 00:18:08,009
Hail them, Lieutenant.

357
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,314
No response.

358
00:18:09,353 --> 00:18:10,983
They're taking up
an attack posture.

359
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:12,186
They're ignoring us.

360
00:18:12,294 --> 00:18:14,664
They're powering up
their forward disrupters.

361
00:18:14,701 --> 00:18:15,670
Shields.

362
00:18:15,703 --> 00:18:16,831
Shields up.

363
00:18:16,873 --> 00:18:18,844
Lock on phasers
and photon torpedoes.

364
00:18:18,878 --> 00:18:20,849
Prepare to fire, if necessary.

365
00:18:20,884 --> 00:18:21,978
Commander...

366
00:18:27,902 --> 00:18:30,740
I think we should talk.

367
00:18:41,169 --> 00:18:43,471
All right, Garak,
do you mind telling me

368
00:18:43,509 --> 00:18:46,107
why a Cardassian warship
is threatening my station?

369
00:18:46,149 --> 00:18:47,641
No one is threatening you.

370
00:18:47,686 --> 00:18:50,250
The Central Command
merely wants to make sure

371
00:18:50,293 --> 00:18:52,230
they have your
undivided attention.

372
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:53,291
Well, they have it.

373
00:18:53,334 --> 00:18:54,769
I assume this has
something to do

374
00:18:54,805 --> 00:18:56,435
with Professor Lang
and her students?

375
00:18:56,475 --> 00:18:59,313
"Students" is a rather
benign term for them.

376
00:18:59,383 --> 00:19:00,990
"Terrorists" would
be more accurate.

377
00:19:01,123 --> 00:19:03,595
The Cardassian government
would very much like

378
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:06,102
Hogue and Rekelen
returned home immediately.

379
00:19:06,136 --> 00:19:08,438
They haven't committed
any crimes here.

380
00:19:08,476 --> 00:19:10,778
As long as they're
on my station

381
00:19:10,815 --> 00:19:12,945
they're free to do
whatever they want.

382
00:19:12,987 --> 00:19:14,617
This is all very embarrassing,
Commander.

383
00:19:14,725 --> 00:19:17,197
The Central Command
would hate to see

384
00:19:17,232 --> 00:19:18,964
the Federation pulled

385
00:19:19,002 --> 00:19:21,804
into such an insignificant
and purely internal affair.

386
00:19:21,844 --> 00:19:23,508
I'd hardly call
it insignificant.

387
00:19:23,548 --> 00:19:25,850
Judging by the behavior
of the ship out there

388
00:19:25,887 --> 00:19:27,447
it appears the Central Command

389
00:19:27,492 --> 00:19:30,294
considers Hogue and Rekelen
to be extremely dangerous.

390
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,802
Not at all.

391
00:19:31,836 --> 00:19:33,169
Annoying perhaps

392
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:35,678
inconvenient maybe,
but dangerous?

393
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:36,678
Hardly.

394
00:19:36,782 --> 00:19:38,446
And if they were dangerous

395
00:19:38,487 --> 00:19:42,190
would the Central Command
entrust the situation to me

396
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,597
a simple tailor?

397
00:19:43,634 --> 00:19:47,235
Which only confirms what
I have suspected all along.

398
00:19:47,277 --> 00:19:49,681
You, Mr. Garak,
are no simple tailor.

399
00:19:50,718 --> 00:19:52,278
Oh, really, Commander.

400
00:19:52,323 --> 00:19:55,263
That's another
discussion entirely.

401
00:19:55,297 --> 00:19:57,565
All you really need
to know right now

402
00:19:57,603 --> 00:20:01,602
is that the return of Hogue and
Rekelen is in the best interest

403
00:20:01,647 --> 00:20:03,242
of the Cardassian Empire.

404
00:20:03,284 --> 00:20:06,851
Or at least in the best interest
of the Cardassian military.

405
00:20:06,894 --> 00:20:08,193
Is there a difference?

406
00:20:08,231 --> 00:20:09,393
Do you really expect

407
00:20:09,434 --> 00:20:11,998
a Bajoran station
under Federation command

408
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,376
to turn over Cardassian
political refugees

409
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:15,609
on your say-so?

410
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:18,886
The ultimate decision
is, of course, yours.

411
00:20:18,925 --> 00:20:21,420
I am simply relaying a message.

412
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:24,930
Then relay this.

413
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:27,344
Tell the Central Command

414
00:20:27,381 --> 00:20:32,554
if anyone attempts to take
Hogue and Rekelen by force

415
00:20:32,594 --> 00:20:34,828
I will respond in kind.

416
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,338
Am I clear, Mr. Garak?

417
00:20:37,373 --> 00:20:38,774
Absolutely.

418
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:41,978
Thank you for your time.

419
00:20:42,018 --> 00:20:46,587
Oh, and if you'd like,
stop by the shop one day.

420
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:49,000
I have a number of suits

421
00:20:49,036 --> 00:20:52,944
that would look
quite flattering on you.

422
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,591
Here you go.

423
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,161
Two mugs of <i>kanar,</i>
on the house.

424
00:21:03,207 --> 00:21:04,837
We didn't order these.

425
00:21:04,878 --> 00:21:06,404
They're the drinks
I promised you

426
00:21:06,448 --> 00:21:07,940
the first time
you came in here.

427
00:21:07,986 --> 00:21:09,046
Sorry they took so long

428
00:21:09,088 --> 00:21:10,854
but things have been
a little hectic.

429
00:21:10,893 --> 00:21:11,862
Do you mind?

430
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,263
I'm afraid that we do.

431
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:15,429
Professor Lang told us
you couldn't be trusted.

432
00:21:15,471 --> 00:21:19,538
Ooh, you Cardassians
do hold grudges.

433
00:21:19,582 --> 00:21:21,212
Seven years ago

434
00:21:21,254 --> 00:21:25,527
Natima and I had some
little, silly lover's quarrel

435
00:21:25,565 --> 00:21:28,060
And... well, all I can say is

436
00:21:28,105 --> 00:21:30,907
I'm willing to let
bygones be bygones.

437
00:21:31,012 --> 00:21:32,504
But Professor Lang isn't.

438
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,521
I have to say,
I find your loyalty to her

439
00:21:34,555 --> 00:21:35,751
extremely... touching.

440
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,762
There is nothing that
we wouldn't do for her

441
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,824
and if she says that
we're not to talk to you

442
00:21:39,868 --> 00:21:40,837
we don't talk to you.

443
00:21:40,871 --> 00:21:42,671
I understand.
She's your teacher.

444
00:21:42,709 --> 00:21:44,178
You're her students.

445
00:21:44,213 --> 00:21:46,116
You have to listen to her.

446
00:21:46,152 --> 00:21:48,180
So, if you don't
want to talk

447
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:49,557
to the only person

448
00:21:49,594 --> 00:21:52,932
who can get you off
this station in one piece

449
00:21:52,969 --> 00:21:54,461
that's fine with me.

450
00:21:54,507 --> 00:21:55,806
Wait.

451
00:21:55,843 --> 00:21:58,840
You say you can
help us get away?

452
00:21:58,885 --> 00:22:00,856
It's possible.

453
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,291
How?

454
00:22:07,106 --> 00:22:08,804
One second.

455
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:31,433
The station Security Chief's
a shape-shifter.

456
00:22:31,469 --> 00:22:33,463
You can never be too careful.

457
00:22:36,682 --> 00:22:42,027
I take it you know
what a, um, cloaking device is.

458
00:22:42,063 --> 00:22:44,034
Well, I have one.

459
00:22:44,068 --> 00:22:46,438
It's not in the best
of condition

460
00:22:46,475 --> 00:22:48,343
but it'll work
for about 15 minutes.

461
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,283
Long enough to get you
away from here.

462
00:22:50,318 --> 00:22:51,480
Sounds expensive.

463
00:22:51,521 --> 00:22:53,355
We don't have much latinum.

464
00:22:53,393 --> 00:22:55,330
What we do h-have...
is yours.

465
00:22:55,364 --> 00:22:58,202
Exactly how much latinum
are we talking about?

466
00:22:58,239 --> 00:22:59,674
No, forget I said that.

467
00:22:59,709 --> 00:23:01,144
I don't want your money.

468
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:03,617
Consider the cloaking device...
a gift.

469
00:23:03,652 --> 00:23:04,916
I'm surprised.

470
00:23:04,955 --> 00:23:06,858
Ferengis aren't known
for their generosity.

471
00:23:06,894 --> 00:23:09,993
Oh, we are a deeply
misunderstood race.

472
00:23:10,036 --> 00:23:11,939
You may have saved our lives.

473
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:14,173
Our movement owes you
a debt of gratitude.

474
00:23:14,213 --> 00:23:16,207
And I know exactly
how you can repay me.

475
00:23:16,251 --> 00:23:18,347
You have to convince Natima
to stay here.

476
00:23:18,391 --> 00:23:21,695
The Professor will never
agree to stay behind.

477
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:28,012
No Natima, no cloaking device,
and no way off this station.

478
00:23:28,049 --> 00:23:29,177
She won't do it.

479
00:23:29,219 --> 00:23:30,917
You'll have
to talk her into it.

480
00:23:30,957 --> 00:23:35,024
After all, you're the ones
the Cardassians are after.

481
00:23:35,067 --> 00:23:36,263
He's right.

482
00:23:36,303 --> 00:23:39,277
She shouldn't have to risk
her life for our crimes.

483
00:23:39,311 --> 00:23:40,780
I suppose we could ask her.

484
00:23:40,816 --> 00:23:42,719
Don't ask her; tell her.

485
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,121
We will.

486
00:23:44,158 --> 00:23:45,958
We'll do our best.

487
00:23:45,996 --> 00:23:48,126
I'm sure you will.

488
00:23:50,006 --> 00:23:52,980
I shudder to think
what would happen

489
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:55,988
if the military got
its hands on you.

490
00:23:56,022 --> 00:23:58,824
Meet us at our quarters
in an hour.

491
00:23:58,863 --> 00:24:00,196
I'll be there.

492
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:09,813
Come in.

493
00:24:14,837 --> 00:24:16,808
Where are Rekelen and Hogue?

494
00:24:16,842 --> 00:24:18,813
They're waiting at the ship.

495
00:24:18,847 --> 00:24:20,316
Perfect.

496
00:24:20,352 --> 00:24:23,656
I know my quarters may seem
a little crowded at first

497
00:24:23,693 --> 00:24:25,857
but tomorrow morning,
I'll put in a request

498
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,994
for something bigger.

499
00:24:27,036 --> 00:24:28,666
That won't be necessary.

500
00:24:28,706 --> 00:24:30,039
All right.

501
00:24:30,076 --> 00:24:31,671
If you want your own quarters

502
00:24:31,714 --> 00:24:33,685
to start out with,
I can arrange that, too.

503
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:35,918
I mean, I'm not staying.

504
00:24:35,959 --> 00:24:37,087
Now, hold on.

505
00:24:37,129 --> 00:24:40,662
Your students and I
have an agreement.

506
00:24:42,242 --> 00:24:45,877
They get the cloaking device
and you stay with me.

507
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:47,889
That way, everyone's happy.

508
00:24:47,923 --> 00:24:49,791
Quark, you say you love me.

509
00:24:49,828 --> 00:24:52,130
Then give me
that cloaking device

510
00:24:52,168 --> 00:24:53,900
and let me be on my way.

511
00:24:53,938 --> 00:24:57,242
And let you disappear
out of my life again?

512
00:24:57,314 --> 00:24:59,080
I'm not part of your life.

513
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:00,145
But you are.

514
00:25:00,188 --> 00:25:01,248
You always have been.

515
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,487
Don't you understand?

516
00:25:02,527 --> 00:25:04,623
Since you left me,
not a day goes by

517
00:25:04,667 --> 00:25:06,467
that I don't
regret what I did.

518
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,034
And now you're asking
me to lose you again!

519
00:25:09,078 --> 00:25:11,208
You lost me a long time ago.

520
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:14,987
All right, then say it.

521
00:25:15,027 --> 00:25:16,223
Let me hear you say

522
00:25:16,263 --> 00:25:18,758
there isn't a spark
of love left in you.

523
00:25:18,803 --> 00:25:20,831
There isn't a spark
of love left in me.

524
00:25:20,876 --> 00:25:21,970
I heard that.

525
00:25:22,011 --> 00:25:23,002
What?

526
00:25:23,048 --> 00:25:24,074
You hesitated.

527
00:25:24,117 --> 00:25:26,054
Admit it... you still care.

528
00:25:26,089 --> 00:25:28,253
Quark, I don't
have time for this.

529
00:25:28,294 --> 00:25:29,729
Give me that cloaking device.

530
00:25:29,765 --> 00:25:30,734
I can't.

531
00:25:30,767 --> 00:25:33,798
I won't let you go.

532
00:25:34,978 --> 00:25:36,140
Quark.

533
00:25:37,485 --> 00:25:40,083
I didn't want to have
to get it this way

534
00:25:40,125 --> 00:25:43,190
but I need that device.

535
00:25:43,233 --> 00:25:45,101
Give it to me.

536
00:25:45,138 --> 00:25:46,870
Now.

537
00:25:48,481 --> 00:25:49,780
Or what?

538
00:25:52,123 --> 00:25:54,117
You'll shoot me?

539
00:25:54,162 --> 00:25:56,498
If I have to.

540
00:25:57,637 --> 00:26:00,337
Then go ahead and shoot.

541
00:26:19,046 --> 00:26:21,712
Quark, Quark?
Are you all right?

542
00:26:21,754 --> 00:26:23,657
You shot me.

543
00:26:23,692 --> 00:26:25,891
Well, I didn't mean to.
It was an accident.

544
00:26:25,931 --> 00:26:27,663
I've never fired
a phaser before.

545
00:26:27,702 --> 00:26:29,069
I barely touched the tri...

546
00:26:29,173 --> 00:26:31,007
Careful.

547
00:26:32,849 --> 00:26:34,079
It hurts?

548
00:26:34,186 --> 00:26:35,655
Oh, she wants
to know if it hurts.

549
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:36,852
Of course it hurts.

550
00:26:36,893 --> 00:26:38,625
It's supposed to hurt...
it's a phaser.

551
00:26:38,665 --> 00:26:40,465
I made sure it was
on the first setting.

552
00:26:40,503 --> 00:26:41,529
How considerate of you.

553
00:26:41,571 --> 00:26:43,599
Should I get a doctor?

554
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:45,204
It's okay.

555
00:26:45,248 --> 00:26:47,777
Maybe if you rub it...

556
00:26:47,821 --> 00:26:50,954
Oh, Quark, I'm sorry.

557
00:26:50,996 --> 00:26:52,556
Really?

558
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,571
Yes, for everything

559
00:26:54,605 --> 00:26:56,405
for all those horrible things
I said.

560
00:26:56,444 --> 00:26:58,142
You really didn't mean them?

561
00:26:58,215 --> 00:26:59,775
I love you, Quark.

562
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:03,957
I've always loved you,
even when I hated you.

563
00:27:11,049 --> 00:27:13,681
Natima.

564
00:27:13,722 --> 00:27:15,420
I've missed you.

565
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,124
I missed you so much.

566
00:27:17,197 --> 00:27:19,965
Being with you was
the happiest time of my life.

567
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:21,406
And now we're together again

568
00:27:21,442 --> 00:27:24,541
and we have the rest
of our lives to be happy.

569
00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:27,751
I wish it was that easy.

570
00:27:27,792 --> 00:27:30,060
But it can be, if you let it.

571
00:27:30,098 --> 00:27:33,402
I'm not the same person
I was seven years ago.

572
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,841
I have responsibilities.

573
00:27:34,877 --> 00:27:36,437
I'll share them with you.

574
00:27:36,481 --> 00:27:38,452
The movement is my life now.

575
00:27:38,486 --> 00:27:40,423
I don't have time
for anything else.

576
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:42,726
We'll make the time.

577
00:27:44,268 --> 00:27:46,034
You're a woman, Natima.

578
00:27:46,072 --> 00:27:47,507
Believe me, I know.

579
00:27:47,543 --> 00:27:50,517
And it's not right
for you to be alone.

580
00:27:50,551 --> 00:27:52,819
I-I'm not alone, I...

581
00:27:52,857 --> 00:27:55,421
I have my students...

582
00:27:55,463 --> 00:27:57,593
my dreams for
a better Cardassia.

583
00:27:57,636 --> 00:28:00,074
But are dreams enough?

584
00:28:00,109 --> 00:28:03,106
Can dreams make you laugh?

585
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,848
Can dreams hold
you close at night?

586
00:28:04,889 --> 00:28:07,019
No!

587
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,862
But my life demands
I make certain sacrifices.

588
00:28:09,902 --> 00:28:11,064
And you've made them

589
00:28:11,104 --> 00:28:13,406
but it doesn't mean
you can't be happy.

590
00:28:13,443 --> 00:28:17,215
We did have fun together,
didn't we?

591
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,887
Remember the day I installed
my first holosuite?

592
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:22,798
I'd never been in one before.

593
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:26,901
I still have that program...
the Picnic on Rhymus Major.

594
00:28:26,946 --> 00:28:28,610
Two suns in the sky.

595
00:28:28,649 --> 00:28:30,779
The sound of the waterfalls.

596
00:28:30,822 --> 00:28:32,952
The whisper of flitterbird
wings over our heads.

597
00:28:32,994 --> 00:28:36,264
You painted my face with honey.

598
00:28:36,303 --> 00:28:40,474
And a Mordian butterfly
landed on your nose.

599
00:28:40,513 --> 00:28:45,788
And a Mordian butterfly
got stuck on my nose.

600
00:28:45,828 --> 00:28:50,705
His wings were beating
almost as fast as my heart.

601
00:28:50,741 --> 00:28:53,236
Those were good times.

602
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,840
The best.

603
00:28:54,884 --> 00:28:59,157
And we can have them back again.

604
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:02,499
I'll give the cloaking
device to your students.

605
00:29:02,538 --> 00:29:04,976
Once they're gone, you'll be
safe and we can be together.

606
00:29:05,011 --> 00:29:06,709
I can't just abandon them.

607
00:29:06,748 --> 00:29:08,274
They need me.

608
00:29:08,386 --> 00:29:10,357
I need you.

609
00:29:13,065 --> 00:29:14,729
Listen to me, Natima

610
00:29:14,769 --> 00:29:17,743
you've done enough
for the movement.

611
00:29:17,777 --> 00:29:19,303
You lit the match.

612
00:29:19,347 --> 00:29:20,873
Let them carry the torch.

613
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:22,514
Or are you saying

614
00:29:22,557 --> 00:29:24,927
that the movement won't
survive without you?

615
00:29:24,962 --> 00:29:26,124
Of course it will.

616
00:29:26,165 --> 00:29:27,691
Then let it

617
00:29:27,737 --> 00:29:31,874
and let us have the
happiness we deserve.

618
00:29:31,914 --> 00:29:35,320
You really do love me,
don't you?

619
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:39,355
With all that I am, Natima...

620
00:29:39,434 --> 00:29:41,462
forever.

621
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:49,687
Will you stay?

622
00:29:49,727 --> 00:29:53,191
Yes, Quark, I'll stay.

623
00:29:53,236 --> 00:29:56,905
You don't know how I've waited
to hear you say that.

624
00:30:01,825 --> 00:30:04,195
Enter.

625
00:30:05,401 --> 00:30:06,563
Professor Lang.

626
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:09,236
Not now, Odo.

627
00:30:09,277 --> 00:30:10,907
Can't you see we're busy?

628
00:30:10,949 --> 00:30:13,444
I apologize
for the interruption

629
00:30:13,555 --> 00:30:16,825
but I'm afraid, madam,
that you are under arrest.

630
00:30:16,864 --> 00:30:17,833
I'm what?

631
00:30:17,867 --> 00:30:18,836
On what charge?

632
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:20,430
Commander Sisko will explain.

633
00:30:20,473 --> 00:30:22,809
I'm truly sorry.

634
00:30:22,846 --> 00:30:23,815
Now, hold on...

635
00:30:23,848 --> 00:30:25,842
Quark, it's all right.

636
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:51,910
Commander, would
you please explain

637
00:30:51,955 --> 00:30:53,481
what we're doing here?

638
00:30:57,269 --> 00:30:58,967
I'm afraid all of you

639
00:30:59,007 --> 00:31:01,445
are to be turned over
to the Cardassian government.

640
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,644
You can't do that.

641
00:31:03,685 --> 00:31:05,245
I wish I didn't have to

642
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:07,227
but Cardassia
has offered to release

643
00:31:07,261 --> 00:31:10,725
half a dozen Bajoran prisoners
in exchange for you.

644
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,205
And you've agreed to this?

645
00:31:12,241 --> 00:31:15,374
The Bajoran Provisional
Government has agreed to it.

646
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:16,783
A Cardassian transport

647
00:31:16,819 --> 00:31:20,123
will deliver the Bajoran
prisoners within five hours.

648
00:31:20,161 --> 00:31:23,796
Commander, you have no idea
what they'll do to us.

649
00:31:23,837 --> 00:31:25,705
We're the ones they're after.

650
00:31:25,742 --> 00:31:27,406
At least let Professor Lang go.

651
00:31:27,447 --> 00:31:30,580
I'd like nothing better,
but the Provisional Government

652
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:33,687
has ordered you all
to be turned over.

653
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:35,598
I'm fighting this
every way I can.

654
00:31:35,635 --> 00:31:38,199
I'm not ready to give up yet.

655
00:31:38,241 --> 00:31:41,306
But in the end,
this is a Bajoran station

656
00:31:41,349 --> 00:31:44,117
and I have to abide
by their decision

657
00:31:44,157 --> 00:31:47,529
no matter how much
I disagree with it.

658
00:32:01,034 --> 00:32:03,438
How the mighty have fallen.

659
00:32:03,474 --> 00:32:04,602
Toran?

660
00:32:04,677 --> 00:32:06,773
It's Gul Toran now.

661
00:32:08,787 --> 00:32:10,621
They made you a Gul.

662
00:32:10,659 --> 00:32:12,357
I didn't realize the situation

663
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:14,493
on Cardassia had gotten
so desperate.

664
00:32:14,536 --> 00:32:17,408
I find your bitterness
extremely gratifying.

665
00:32:17,443 --> 00:32:19,881
I'm glad to see
that you're adjusting

666
00:32:19,917 --> 00:32:21,045
so poorly to exile.

667
00:32:21,086 --> 00:32:25,223
Actually, I'm finding
my time here quite illuminating.

668
00:32:25,263 --> 00:32:27,929
Then I don't suppose
you'd be interested

669
00:32:27,971 --> 00:32:30,135
in going home again?

670
00:32:30,176 --> 00:32:32,044
Am I to be rewarded

671
00:32:32,081 --> 00:32:34,052
for informing
the Central Command

672
00:32:34,087 --> 00:32:37,551
about the presence of Hogue
and Rekelen on the station?

673
00:32:37,596 --> 00:32:39,294
Perhaps.

674
00:32:40,604 --> 00:32:42,838
But only after you see to it

675
00:32:42,876 --> 00:32:46,282
that they don't leave
this station alive.

676
00:32:46,318 --> 00:32:49,224
But I suggested
a prisoner exchange

677
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,494
and the Central Command agreed.

678
00:32:51,531 --> 00:32:53,297
I convinced them otherwise.

679
00:32:53,336 --> 00:32:54,737
And they listened to you?

680
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:57,405
My voice is less tarnished
than yours.

681
00:32:57,447 --> 00:33:00,353
Kill them, and all you
do is create martyrs.

682
00:33:00,389 --> 00:33:03,295
You overestimate
their importance.

683
00:33:03,329 --> 00:33:05,323
And how do you
propose to arrange

684
00:33:05,368 --> 00:33:06,998
this unfortunate incident?

685
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,534
I'm sure you'll think
of something.

686
00:33:09,578 --> 00:33:11,572
You always did in the past.

687
00:33:11,617 --> 00:33:12,847
Don't you see?

688
00:33:12,888 --> 00:33:15,885
Lang's death
will benefit us both.

689
00:33:15,928 --> 00:33:17,329
Unless, of course

690
00:33:17,366 --> 00:33:21,240
you intend to spend the rest
of your life as a tailor.

691
00:33:21,276 --> 00:33:22,940
I see your point.

692
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,644
I knew you would.

693
00:33:35,418 --> 00:33:37,856
Odo, we have to talk.

694
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,624
I'm busy.
Come back later.

695
00:33:40,665 --> 00:33:43,365
Later will be too late.

696
00:33:45,343 --> 00:33:48,111
<i>I, The Jury,</i>
by Mickey Spillane?

697
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:51,182
Chief O'Brien loaned it to me.

698
00:33:51,226 --> 00:33:54,223
This better be important, Quark.

699
00:33:54,267 --> 00:33:56,067
It is.

700
00:33:56,105 --> 00:33:59,808
Odo, you have to let Natima
and her students go.

701
00:33:59,881 --> 00:34:01,145
Do I?

702
00:34:01,185 --> 00:34:04,489
Those students could be
the key to a new Cardassia

703
00:34:04,526 --> 00:34:08,127
a Cardassia free of
military rule and oppression.

704
00:34:08,169 --> 00:34:10,368
Now, since when have you become

705
00:34:10,408 --> 00:34:12,972
so interested
in Cardassian politics?

706
00:34:13,016 --> 00:34:15,215
A freer, more open society
on Cardassia

707
00:34:15,254 --> 00:34:17,157
would benefit
this entire sector

708
00:34:17,192 --> 00:34:19,687
and it would be great
for business.

709
00:34:19,732 --> 00:34:22,900
So, wanting me to free
Natima and those students

710
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:26,381
is strictly a financial
consideration on your part.

711
00:34:26,417 --> 00:34:27,909
Now, Odo...

712
00:34:27,953 --> 00:34:29,252
don't allow my greed

713
00:34:29,291 --> 00:34:31,820
to keep you from doing
the right thing.

714
00:34:31,898 --> 00:34:34,462
I know you better
than you think, Quark.

715
00:34:34,504 --> 00:34:36,168
This isn't about Cardassia

716
00:34:36,209 --> 00:34:38,841
and for once, it's not
even about profit.

717
00:34:38,882 --> 00:34:41,218
This is about Professor Lang.

718
00:34:41,255 --> 00:34:43,454
You're right.

719
00:34:43,494 --> 00:34:45,260
It is.

720
00:34:45,299 --> 00:34:46,791
Her life is in jeopardy

721
00:34:46,837 --> 00:34:49,970
as long as Rekelen and Hogue
are on the station.

722
00:34:50,011 --> 00:34:53,417
Now, why didn't you
tell me that before?

723
00:34:57,765 --> 00:35:00,363
What was I supposed to say?

724
00:35:00,405 --> 00:35:02,035
That I love her?

725
00:35:02,076 --> 00:35:05,175
That I would do
anything for her?

726
00:35:05,217 --> 00:35:08,316
That without her,
my life would be meaningless.

727
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:12,233
Sure, I could say those things,
but what good would it do?

728
00:35:12,269 --> 00:35:14,741
How could I expect you
to understand?

729
00:35:14,775 --> 00:35:17,077
You've never had
those feelings.

730
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,675
You don't know what it means

731
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:20,713
to really care
about another person.

732
00:35:20,758 --> 00:35:22,227
You've never been in love.

733
00:35:22,261 --> 00:35:24,460
You've got all the emotions
of a stone.

734
00:35:27,843 --> 00:35:29,403
No offense.

735
00:35:29,447 --> 00:35:32,079
Go on.

736
00:35:34,961 --> 00:35:36,955
Listen to me, Odo.

737
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:41,543
You do this for me,
and I promise you

738
00:35:41,578 --> 00:35:44,677
there'll be no more secrets
between us.

739
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:49,164
I'll tell you about
every underhanded deal

740
00:35:49,198 --> 00:35:53,163
every lying scheme,
every dirty trick

741
00:35:53,209 --> 00:35:56,615
my brother Rom's involved in.

742
00:35:56,651 --> 00:36:01,562
Well... since you put it
that way

743
00:36:01,597 --> 00:36:04,161
I'm not interested.

744
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:08,705
Okay.

745
00:36:08,748 --> 00:36:11,813
Okay, let me put it another way.

746
00:36:13,161 --> 00:36:14,927
Do it for me.

747
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:16,264
For you?

748
00:36:16,302 --> 00:36:17,635
That's right.

749
00:36:17,672 --> 00:36:20,304
For all the years
we've known each other

750
00:36:20,346 --> 00:36:22,648
for everything we've
been through together.

751
00:36:22,685 --> 00:36:25,659
You say you know me
better than anyone else.

752
00:36:25,693 --> 00:36:26,992
Well, I know you.

753
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:30,300
Sure, sometimes we're
on opposite sides

754
00:36:30,338 --> 00:36:33,278
but that doesn't mean
that we aren't close.

755
00:36:33,313 --> 00:36:34,839
I never told you this, Odo

756
00:36:34,883 --> 00:36:36,786
but I consider you
as dear to me

757
00:36:36,821 --> 00:36:38,256
as my brother.

758
00:36:39,395 --> 00:36:42,928
And I've seen how well
you treat him.

759
00:36:49,622 --> 00:36:50,648
Odo...

760
00:36:50,691 --> 00:36:52,160
Look at me.

761
00:36:56,305 --> 00:36:57,569
Look at me.

762
00:36:57,609 --> 00:36:59,512
I'm on my knees.

763
00:36:59,548 --> 00:37:02,420
I'm begging you.

764
00:37:02,455 --> 00:37:04,426
I don't care why you do it.

765
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,192
Pick any reason you want

766
00:37:06,231 --> 00:37:09,137
but please let Natima
and the others go.

767
00:37:10,709 --> 00:37:12,873
All right, I'll do it.

768
00:37:12,915 --> 00:37:13,941
You will?

769
00:37:13,985 --> 00:37:16,355
But not for you.

770
00:37:16,391 --> 00:37:19,422
Turning Hogue and Rekelen over
to the Cardassians

771
00:37:19,465 --> 00:37:20,991
would mean their deaths.

772
00:37:21,036 --> 00:37:23,064
I've read their files,
and nothing they've done

773
00:37:23,142 --> 00:37:24,577
warrants that kind
of punishment.

774
00:37:24,613 --> 00:37:29,854
I'll free them, Quark,
but only in the name of justice.

775
00:37:29,893 --> 00:37:31,385
Justice.

776
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:34,096
That was going to be
my next suggestion.

777
00:37:37,045 --> 00:37:40,646
So, you're not really
doing this for me?

778
00:37:40,687 --> 00:37:41,656
That's right.

779
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:43,627
Then I don't owe you a thing.
Thank you!

780
00:37:43,662 --> 00:37:46,693
You'll never know
how much this means to me.

781
00:37:46,736 --> 00:37:50,142
Let go.

782
00:37:50,178 --> 00:37:51,647
Sorry.

783
00:37:51,683 --> 00:37:54,315
Uh... now, um, let's hurry

784
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:57,421
before you change your mind.

785
00:37:57,464 --> 00:37:59,059
One question.

786
00:37:59,102 --> 00:38:01,096
How do you expect
Rekelen and Hogue

787
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,609
to get past that war ship?

788
00:38:02,644 --> 00:38:03,635
Uh...

789
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,808
Uh-huh...

790
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:07,824
I knew you had
a cloaking device.

791
00:38:07,858 --> 00:38:11,925
I always said you were
too smart for me, Odo.

792
00:38:16,681 --> 00:38:19,153
Quark... what are
you doing here?

793
00:38:19,254 --> 00:38:21,225
Getting you out.

794
00:38:25,504 --> 00:38:26,734
Thank you.

795
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,218
Good luck.

796
00:38:34,327 --> 00:38:35,957
I've installed
the cloaking device

797
00:38:35,998 --> 00:38:37,365
in the central
engine core.

798
00:38:37,401 --> 00:38:38,802
You can activate
it from the Bridge

799
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:40,809
as soon as the mooring
clamps are released.

800
00:38:40,843 --> 00:38:43,042
Then, I suggest you take
your ship to warp 8

801
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:44,552
and don't look back.

802
00:38:46,592 --> 00:38:49,657
Now, please, make
your good-byes brief.

803
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,694
Oh, what's the rush?

804
00:38:53,242 --> 00:38:55,338
You've betrayed us.

805
00:38:57,387 --> 00:38:59,255
No.

806
00:38:59,358 --> 00:39:03,357
Don't... I'd hate to ruin
such a... nice suit.

807
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:08,411
Why are you doing this?

808
00:39:08,449 --> 00:39:11,480
Oh, exile tends to wear
a bit thin after a while

809
00:39:11,523 --> 00:39:14,223
even with surroundings
as pleasant as these.

810
00:39:14,264 --> 00:39:18,104
Fine, take them,
but leave Natima alone.

811
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,109
Quark!

812
00:39:19,143 --> 00:39:20,612
No, he's right.

813
00:39:20,647 --> 00:39:22,242
We're the fugitives, not you.

814
00:39:22,285 --> 00:39:24,051
You see, they agree with me.

815
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:27,930
Unfortunately, it's not their
decision to make, nor mine.

816
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:30,768
Professor Lang, however minor
her role in this matter

817
00:39:30,806 --> 00:39:33,871
has come to the attention
of the Central Command.

818
00:39:33,914 --> 00:39:36,614
Do you think killing us
will change anything?

819
00:39:36,655 --> 00:39:39,652
Cardassia is slipping out
of the hands of the military.

820
00:39:39,696 --> 00:39:41,462
And nothing you do
will prevent it.

821
00:39:41,501 --> 00:39:43,495
Madam, I am not here
to debate you.

822
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:46,240
Garak, if you harm
these people, I'll see to it

823
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,910
that Commander Sisko
prosecutes you

824
00:39:47,951 --> 00:39:50,253
to the fullest extent
of the law.

825
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:52,284
Which brings up another issue.

826
00:39:52,329 --> 00:39:54,995
Quark, things would have gone
much easier

827
00:39:55,036 --> 00:39:56,631
if you'd taken my advice

828
00:39:56,674 --> 00:39:59,442
and not gotten involved
with these people.

829
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:02,353
I was already involved.

830
00:40:02,389 --> 00:40:04,223
I know.
A pity, really.

831
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:07,291
Personally,
I rather like you, Quark.

832
00:40:07,335 --> 00:40:09,807
You mean, you're going
to shoot me, too?

833
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:13,077
Before I became a tailor,
I lived by a simple motto:

834
00:40:13,116 --> 00:40:16,488
Never let sentiment
get in the way of your work.

835
00:40:16,525 --> 00:40:19,157
A bit of a cliché,
but true, nonetheless.

836
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:21,763
I'll keep that in mind.

837
00:40:21,806 --> 00:40:26,147
Well, then, although I admit
it's against my better judgment

838
00:40:26,184 --> 00:40:30,321
I'm afraid I must carry out the
verdict of the Central Command.

839
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:32,195
But you admit
that they're wrong.

840
00:40:32,232 --> 00:40:35,206
Why don't you stand up
for what you believe in?

841
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:40,015
More to the point,
what do you believe in, Garak?

842
00:40:40,053 --> 00:40:41,317
What are you doing here, Toran?

843
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:42,187
Making sure that you
carry out your assignment.

844
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:47,027
I suspected that two years
living among the Bajorans

845
00:40:47,066 --> 00:40:48,262
would make you soft.

846
00:40:48,303 --> 00:40:49,636
I see that I was right.

847
00:40:49,673 --> 00:40:51,907
You've never been right
about anything.

848
00:40:51,946 --> 00:40:53,381
Now, step aside, Toran

849
00:40:53,416 --> 00:40:56,116
and allow me to finish
this sorry business.

850
00:40:56,157 --> 00:40:58,686
I will take over from here.

851
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:01,328
Why?
So you can take the credit

852
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:04,742
and to make sure I remain
in disgrace?

853
00:41:04,779 --> 00:41:07,651
I can't believe that you
were once considered clever.

854
00:41:07,687 --> 00:41:10,251
Do you think that by completing
this one simple task

855
00:41:10,293 --> 00:41:12,891
your reputation will be restored
at Central Command?

856
00:41:12,933 --> 00:41:16,500
No, I suppose not.

857
00:41:16,543 --> 00:41:18,537
Go back to your sewing kit...

858
00:41:18,581 --> 00:41:21,019
tailor.

859
00:41:28,775 --> 00:41:32,649
Well, some people
should never be promoted.

860
00:41:32,685 --> 00:41:35,157
Well, don't just stand there!

861
00:41:35,191 --> 00:41:36,991
Your ship is waiting.

862
00:41:37,029 --> 00:41:38,727
I'm going to see to it
that every Ferengi

863
00:41:38,768 --> 00:41:40,260
on this station
shops in your store.

864
00:41:40,304 --> 00:41:43,710
Ah, that alone
makes it all worthwhile.

865
00:41:43,747 --> 00:41:46,379
You heard the man.
Get moving.

866
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:48,153
Thank you.

867
00:41:50,164 --> 00:41:51,531
Both of you.

868
00:41:51,567 --> 00:41:53,663
Yes, yes, yes.
Go, go, and quickly.

869
00:41:53,706 --> 00:41:56,042
Keep up the good work.

870
00:42:13,257 --> 00:42:17,097
Quark,
I've got to say good-bye.

871
00:42:17,133 --> 00:42:18,568
Oh, just let them go.

872
00:42:18,604 --> 00:42:20,734
It'll be less painful that way.

873
00:42:20,776 --> 00:42:24,809
No, you don't understand.

874
00:42:24,853 --> 00:42:27,850
I have to say good-bye to you.

875
00:42:27,895 --> 00:42:30,459
I'm going with them.

876
00:42:30,501 --> 00:42:32,665
But we had a deal.

877
00:42:32,707 --> 00:42:34,405
I can't stay here.

878
00:42:34,445 --> 00:42:38,512
Maybe one day I can come back,
and we'll be together again

879
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,755
but not until my work is done.

880
00:42:40,795 --> 00:42:42,698
So, all I have to do
to get you back

881
00:42:42,733 --> 00:42:46,174
is wait until Cardassia becomes
a free and democratic society?

882
00:42:50,086 --> 00:42:52,650
I promise...

883
00:42:52,693 --> 00:42:56,260
I'll make it worth the wait.

884
00:43:06,929 --> 00:43:09,801
I don't suppose
I could come with you.

885
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,538
No, it's not your fight.

886
00:43:14,583 --> 00:43:16,817
Besides, I could never
live with myself

887
00:43:16,855 --> 00:43:18,587
if something happened to you.

888
00:43:18,626 --> 00:43:22,729
I need to know that
you're here, safe.

889
00:43:22,771 --> 00:43:27,512
That way, a part of me
will always be safe, too.

890
00:43:34,968 --> 00:43:38,842
I love you, Quark.

891
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,907
I always will.

892
00:43:55,823 --> 00:43:58,854
I love you, too.

893
00:44:02,005 --> 00:44:05,469
I suggest we return
to the Promenade without delay.

894
00:44:05,515 --> 00:44:09,048
You have to tell me.
Why did you do it?

895
00:44:09,091 --> 00:44:10,891
Shoot Toran.

896
00:44:10,929 --> 00:44:13,025
Why did you let
Professor Lang go?

897
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,733
I have no choice.
I love her.

898
00:44:15,774 --> 00:44:17,472
And I love Cardassia

899
00:44:17,512 --> 00:44:20,611
which is why
I had to do what I did.

900
00:44:22,091 --> 00:44:24,723
I don't understand.

901
00:44:24,765 --> 00:44:27,898
That's the thing about love.

902
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:31,005
No one really
understands it, do they?
