1
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:06,298
(<i> laughter</i> )

2
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:15,933
Dabo!

3
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:18,018
Quark!

4
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,060
Oh... not now, Odo.

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,562
We have to talk.

6
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:21,605
It'll have to wait.

7
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:22,606
It can't wait.

8
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:24,525
Of course not.

9
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:25,651
Make it fast.

10
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:27,361
I have business
to attend to.

11
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,864
You remember
that Subytt freighter

12
00:00:29,864 --> 00:00:31,114
we were discussing
the other day--

13
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,575
the one you claimed
was smuggling

14
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,786
defective isolinear rods
to Bajor?

15
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:36,996
Yes, yes.
What about it?

16
00:00:36,996 --> 00:00:38,205
Well, I conducted

17
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,374
a little investigation
of that freighter,

18
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,877
and do you know
what I discovered?

19
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:47,214
That I was telling
the truth.

20
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,010
That's right.

21
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,013
I arrested the First Officer
and two of the crew.

22
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:55,347
Congratulations,
Constable.

23
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:56,849
I knew you
could do it.

24
00:00:56,849 --> 00:01:00,268
Now, if you don't mind,
I am needed upstairs.

25
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:01,729
Hold on.

26
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:03,939
I'm not finished
with you.

27
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,232
Oh, really, Odo?

28
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,693
Sometimes I think
there's no pleasing you.

29
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:10,362
I help you crack a
notorious smuggling ring,

30
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:13,782
and yet you still insist on
treating me like the enemy?

31
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,868
You<i> are</i> the enemy.

32
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:17,912
Then how do you explain

33
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:19,204
my helping you?

34
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:21,665
That's just it.

35
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:24,585
I<i> can't</i> explain it.

36
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,461
It's simple, really.

37
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:29,548
I figured we've been at each
others' throats long enough.

38
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:31,592
It's time we called a truce.

39
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:32,634
Truce?

40
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,093
You must be joking.

41
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:36,388
Ask the Subytt
First Officer

42
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:37,806
if I'm joking.

43
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,641
From now on, you and I
are going to be friends.

44
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:43,437
You're up to something.

45
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,688
Why would you say that?

46
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:47,357
Because you're always
up to something.

47
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:50,318
I can see this is
going to take time

48
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:53,488
but eventually you'll
learn to trust me.

49
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,240
Hmm, hmm.

50
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,992
That'll be the day.

51
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:08,545
I don't think
I can remember

52
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,673
Odo ever looking
so... perplexed.

53
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:12,925
He's not alone.

54
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:14,635
Those Subytt smugglers

55
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,220
were a potential source
of great profit.

56
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,557
Must I quote you
the 76th Rule of Acquisition?

57
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,850
The 76th...

58
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,853
"Every once in a while,
declare peace.

59
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,982
It confuses the hell
out of your enemies."

60
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,914
Hi, Quark.

61
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,416
How are your lobes?

62
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:51,379
Tingling at the sight of you.

63
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,882
What'll it be, hmm?

64
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,801
Another black hole?

65
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,719
No, I don't have time.

66
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,930
My ship's
about to pull out.

67
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,932
Do you know of anyone
going to Bajor?

68
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:04,434
Ships go back and forth
from there all the time.

69
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,894
Why?

70
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:09,940
I promised someone I'd
deliver this for them.

71
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,651
Doesn't look like I'm going
to get there this trip.

72
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,862
It's an earring.

73
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:16,279
I know it's an earring.

74
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,615
It was given to me
by a maintenance worker

75
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,159
on Cardassia IV.

76
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,412
Are you saying a Cardassian
gave you a Bajoran earring?

77
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,498
He asked me to
take it to Bajor.

78
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:29,084
Said whoever I showed
it to would understand.

79
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,919
He said that?

80
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,880
Well, this is a Bajoran
station, isn't it?

81
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,506
Mm-hmm.

82
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:37,384
Well, there must be
someone here

83
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,511
who would know
what to do with it.

84
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:40,679
Oh, there is.

85
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,347
Who?

86
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,685
Me.

87
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,834
(<i> door chimes</i> )

88
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:14,880
Come in.

89
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,550
Surprise.

90
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,010
What do you want?

91
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,179
I always wondered what
your quarters looked like.

92
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,305
That better not be
your only reason
for being here.

93
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,349
You don't entertain
much, do you?

94
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,517
Oh, I entertain a lot--

95
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,019
I just don't
entertain you.

96
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,605
Let me guess.

97
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,398
The bedroom.

98
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,109
You take one step in here

99
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:37,360
and I promise you
it'll be your last.

100
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,571
It could be worth it.

101
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:40,614
You've got
five seconds

102
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,949
to tell me
what you want.

103
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,450
Aren't you going
to offer me a beverage?

104
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,077
Five... four...

105
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:46,912
Can we at least sit down?

106
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,873
Three, two, one.

107
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,083
Wait!

108
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:54,086
I brought you something.

109
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,132
Where did you get that?

110
00:04:58,132 --> 00:04:59,507
Is it valuable?

111
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,468
I said
where did you get it?

112
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,220
From a Boslic
Freighter Captain.

113
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,305
She got it
from a Cardassian.

114
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,389
Where?

115
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,849
On Cardassia IV.

116
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,726
That's what she
told me, anyway.

117
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,693
Consider it a gift!

118
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,690
Hey, Dad, wait up.

119
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,693
You got a minute?

120
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,445
For you, absolutely.

121
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,655
I've got
some great news.

122
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:28,823
You passed your
algebra test.

123
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,325
Better than that.

124
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:31,451
You learned how to hit
Bob Gibson's fastball.

125
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,744
No, even better.

126
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,079
Better than hitting
Gibson's fastball?

127
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,580
This I want to hear.

128
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,082
You remember that Bajoran
girl I told you about?

129
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,208
The one with
the beautiful smile?

130
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,085
That's right-- Laira.

131
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,169
I decided
to ask her out.

132
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,337
Well, good for you.

133
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,005
And now you've come
to the old man

134
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,548
for advice on
what to say to her.

135
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,967
Dad, I al...
The main thing is

136
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,718
you can't be afraid
of rejection.

137
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,762
Dad, I already asked her
out, and she said yes.

138
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,639
She did?
That's wonderful.

139
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,890
I was just wondering

140
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,350
if you had any ideas
on what we could do.

141
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,644
I was thinking of taking her
to the holosuites.

142
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,729
The holosuites?
I don't think so.

143
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:00,730
Why not?

144
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,898
Because you're too young

145
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,483
to take a girl
to the holosuites.

146
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,777
Okay, then how about if I
take her to our quarters?

147
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:06,987
Oh, no, no.

148
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:07,946
No quarters.

149
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,739
We're just going to talk.

150
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:10,907
Talk in public.

151
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,533
It's not the same.

152
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:13,952
You want to talk?

153
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,578
Take her upstairs.

154
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,997
And that way you can talk

155
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,458
and watch the ships
go through the wormhole.

156
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,542
That's boring.
Since when?

157
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,003
Since I started
going out with girls.

158
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,921
This is your first date.

159
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,382
And I don't want it
to be my last.

160
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:28,967
Commander,
I need to speak with you.

161
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,344
One moment, Major.

162
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,429
I can see
you're not ready

163
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,930
to have this
conversation yet.

164
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,598
<i>I'm</i> not ready?

165
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,851
I'll just have to come up
with a few ideas on my own.

166
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,686
Really,
don't worry about it.

167
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,980
Who's worried?

168
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,148
Commander?

169
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,234
Join me, Major.

170
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:55,785
One<i> raktajino</i>
with a<i> jacarine</i> peel.

171
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,704
Nothing for me.

172
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:08,089
SISKO:
One icoberry torte.

173
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,471
So... Major...

174
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,223
what can I do for you?

175
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,891
I need to borrow
a runabout.

176
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,726
For what?

177
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,978
You really don't want
to ask me that.

178
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,021
It's too late.

179
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,398
I already asked.

180
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,483
You don't want
to know the answer.

181
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,776
Major, I can't loan you
a Starfleet runabout

182
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,862
without knowing
where you plan on taking it.

183
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:37,952
To Cardassia IV to rescue
a Bajoran prisoner of war.

184
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,788
(<i> whistles</i> )

185
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,874
You're right.

186
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,543
I wish you hadn't told me.

187
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:47,712
This earring was recently
smuggled off the planet.

188
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,880
Do you see this?

189
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,050
That is the insignia
of Li Nalas.

190
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,553
The resistance leader?
The greatest we ever had.

191
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:56,846
His victory over Gul Zarale
in hand-to-hand combat...

192
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,181
Major, I have already
heard the story.

193
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,434
Wasn't he reported
killed in action?

194
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,227
His body was never found.

195
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,604
Look, Commander,
I wouldn't be asking you this

196
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,648
if I thought there was
any other way to rescue Li.

197
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:10,444
But Bajoran ships just don't
have the maneuverability

198
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:11,986
or the defensive capabilities

199
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:15,198
to get me safely in and out
of Cardassian territory.

200
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,036
You're sure this is genuine?

201
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,122
Dax found dermal residue
on the backing.

202
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,707
A genetic analysis matched
it to Li's DNA records.

203
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,167
It's genuine all right.

204
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,087
Have you told
the provisional government?

205
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,923
I contacted
three ministers.

206
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:35,093
Their response was
exactly what I expected.

207
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,887
In other words,
they're unwilling

208
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:42,183
to risk going to war
with Cardassia over an earring.

209
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,563
I can't say I blame them.

210
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:50,775
Commander, you and I both know
the provisional government

211
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,902
is made up
of political opportunists

212
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,113
too busy
fighting amongst themselves

213
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:57,031
to care what happens to Bajor.

214
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,575
Since the loss
of the Kai,

215
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,994
the situation has only
gone from bad to worse.

216
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,996
There are reports
of factional fighting

217
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,705
in half a dozen districts.

218
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,501
Religious riots have spread
throughout the southern islands.

219
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,127
Bajor needs a leader--

220
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,004
someone the people
will listen to,

221
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,339
someone they can trust.

222
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:15,509
And you think that Li Nalas
is that leader?

223
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,135
I know he is.

224
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,637
<i>( radio beeps ) </i>
<i>O'Brien to Sisko.</i>

225
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:21,097
Go ahead, Chief.

226
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,891
<i>I think you and Odo had better</i>
<i>join me in the Habitat Ring,</i>

227
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,477

228
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:27,604
<i>There's something</i>
<i>you should see.</i>

229
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,356
We'll be right there.

230
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,067
Do I get
the runabout?

231
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,822
I'll have to think it over.

232
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,620
I was on my way
to Crossover Bridge 3

233
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,997
to do some repair work
on the field modulators

234
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:47,706
when I noticed this.

235
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,043
(<i> Sisko sighs</i> )

236
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,379
SISKO:
This is the emblem
of the Alliance

237
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,463
for Global Unity.

238
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:54,548
They call themselves
the Circle.

239
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:56,757
O'BRIEN:
The Circle, huh?

240
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:59,093
What gives them the right
to mess up our station?

241
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,719
They're an extremist faction

242
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:03,806
who believe in Bajor
for the Bajorans.

243
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,766
All other species
are inferior

244
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,644
and should be expelled
from the planet.

245
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,896
I understand this emblem
has appeared all over Bajor.

246
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,439
That's correct

247
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,858
but this is the first
time I've seen it here.

248
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,902
I want to be
informed immediately

249
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,904
if this emblem appears
anyplace else on the station.

250
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,364
Understood.

251
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:20,699
If they think scrawling
a few signs

252
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:21,949
is going to get rid of us,

253
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,077
they've got another
think coming.

254
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,286
Right now, they're just
trying to show us

255
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,787
that we're vulnerable.

256
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,623
I wouldn't be overly
concerned, Commander.

257
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,667
This section is a
low-security area.

258
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,085
As of now, Constable

259
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:35,338
there are no low-security areas
on this station.

260
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,352
<i>( door opens )</i>

261
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,937
You wanted to see
me, Benjamin?

262
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,732
Ah, yes.
Have a seat.

263
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:56,359
Am I to assume this is
going to be about baseball?

264
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,652
Not this time.

265
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,070
Good.

266
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,197
I thought you enjoyed
talking about baseball.

267
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,116
Curzon enjoyed it,

268
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:06,536
but not half as much
as he led you to believe.

269
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,871
So what's on your mind,
Benjamin?

270
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,832
I've been thinking
about our mission here.

271
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,792
I look at the turmoil on Bajor

272
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:16,337
and I see everything
we fought for this past year

273
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,922
starting to unravel.

274
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,591
I told you this was going
to be a tough assignment

275
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:21,342
when we came here.

276
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:24,178
Of course, I didn't realize
it was going to be this tough.

277
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:27,014
What if I told you
that I knew someone

278
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,975
who could bring stability
to Bajor?

279
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,018
Someone who could
unite the factions

280
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,104
and give us a chance
to do our job?

281
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:36,899
I'd say give Kira the runabout.

282
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,611
How do you know
about Kira wanting a runabout?

283
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:42,863
I promise not to tell.

284
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,449
All right.

285
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:47,243
Supposing I do help
and she does rescue Li Nalas.

286
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,370
What do we say
to the Cardassians?

287
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,955
The question is

288
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,791
what do they say to us?

289
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,208
They swore
they released

290
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,043
all their
Bajoran prisoners.

291
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,112
Chief...

292
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,072
Major Kira
needs a runabout.

293
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:28,075
Oh, so she's going
to Cardassia IV after all.

294
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:31,788
Is there anyone on this station
she didn't tell?

295
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,707
I doubt
she mentioned it to Quark.

296
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:36,793
Well, then,
as far as Quark's concerned

297
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,461
she's going to Lamenda Prime

298
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:39,587
to bring back
mineral samples.

299
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,839
I see.

300
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:42,256
Now, is there any
way we can prevent

301
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,800
the Cardassian sensors

302
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,468
from picking up
the runabout's signature?

303
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,679
I could modulate
the engine's power emissions,

304
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:50,014
reconfigure
the deflector shield grid

305
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,098
and install field buffers

306
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,684
around the subspace
emitter coil.

307
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,561
By the time I'm done,
the Cardassians will think

308
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,730
they're picking up
a Lissepian transport.

309
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:57,856
Yeah?

310
00:14:57,856 --> 00:14:59,774
I see you've
already given this

311
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:01,818
a bit of thought.

312
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,361
I suppose I have.

313
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,746
(<i> door chimes</i> )

314
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:13,872
Come in.

315
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,168
Commander... Chief.

316
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,712
I was just
getting ready to leave.

317
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:22,380
I just stopped by
to wish you luck.

318
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,593
And...

319
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,511
to tell you
that Chief O'Brien

320
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,972
will be accompanying you
on your mission.

321
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,102
I don't think
that's a good idea.

322
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,730
Having a Federation officer
along

323
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,774
could cause complications
for you later.

324
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,817
I'm willing to risk that.

325
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:44,819
You're an excellent
pilot, Major

326
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:47,363
but Mr. O'Brien here
is better.

327
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,823
And I want to make sure

328
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:53,244
that I get my runabout
back in one piece.

329
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:57,039
I appreciate the offer,
but this is a Bajoran problem.

330
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,917
I don't agree.

331
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:03,421
The truth is, I need
Li Nalas back on Bajor

332
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:04,422
as much as you do.

333
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,090
O'BRIEN:
Besides

334
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,843
I've seen how the Cardassians
treat their prisoners.

335
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:11,304
No one should have
to suffer like that.

336
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,598
If the Cardassians
get their hands on us

337
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:14,933
we'll be the ones
suffering.

338
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:18,227
They'll have to catch us first.

339
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,153
I suppose I could
use the company.

340
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,952
You've got
the controls, Chief.

341
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:35,202
Right.

342
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,749
Before we go

343
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:42,710
there's, uh, one thing we need
to clear up between us.

344
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,003
What's that?

345
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,797
This mission can end
only one of two ways--

346
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:49,425
either we bring back Li Nalas,
or we don't come back at all.

347
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,969
Understood.

348
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,599
Then take us out of here,
Mr. O'Brien.

349
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,977
Initializing launch sequence.

350
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,373
How much longer
till we reach Cardassia IV?

351
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:23,250
I estimate
another 30 minutes.

352
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,128
Hold on.

353
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,922
We're being scanned.

354
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:29,507
Can you get a fix
on the source?

355
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:35,805
Its position is holding steady
at bearing 219 mark 23.

356
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:38,265
It must be
a navigational control post.

357
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,393
It's probably
just a routine scan.

358
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:41,352
(<i> beeping</i> )

359
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:42,854
We're being hailed.

360
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:45,648
Then again,
we could be in serious trouble.

361
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:48,317
They're repeating the hail.

362
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,862
We're on the edge
of their scanner range.

363
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:52,405
That puts us out
of visual contact.

364
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:55,491
I say we try
and bluff them.

365
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,495
Opening a channel.

366
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:04,042
CARDASSIAN:
<i>This is Cardassian Navigational</i>
<i>Control Post 24.</i>

367
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:05,459
<i>Identify yourself.</i>

368
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:08,462
This is the Lissepian
Transport<i> Martuk.</i>

369
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,297
<i>According to our scan,</i>

370
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:14,552
<i>your subspace field emitters</i>
<i>appear to be malfunctioning.</i>

371
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:18,472
The field buffers must be
distorting our power signature.

372
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:22,518
Uh, we're... having problems
with our phase modulators.

373
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,021
We're attempting
to correct the problem.

374
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,564
<i>Do you require assistance?</i>

375
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:29,567
<i>We can dispatch a repair ship.</i>

376
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:32,445
They want to help us?

377
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:38,158
Your offer is most appreciated,
Post 24, but unnecessary.

378
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,660
<i>Are you certain?</i>

379
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,538
<i>Your power signature</i>
<i>is still fluctuating.</i>

380
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,457
He's getting suspicious.

381
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:51,965
I believe we can correct
the problem on our own.

382
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:55,551
Besides, Gul Marayn is waiting

383
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,844
on Cardassia IV

384
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,596
to receive my shipment
of<i> rulot</i> seeds.

385
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,181
Any delay could ruin
the entire crop,

386
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,726
not to mention the Gul's mood.

387
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,561
<i>Understood.</i>

388
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,689
<i>You can put in for repairs</i>
<i>after you deliver your cargo.</i>

389
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,233
My plan, exactly.

390
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,323
He's cut off their transmission.

391
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,033
(<i> sighing</i> )

392
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,120
Tell me, Major...

393
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,580
who is
this Gul Marayn?

394
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,332
Don't ask me.

395
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,250
I just made him up.

396
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:39,512
We're in synchronous orbit
above the Hutet labor camp.

397
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,140
I've limited the bio-scans

398
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,475
to detect only
Bajoran life-forms.

399
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:47,269
(<i> beeping</i> )

400
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,188
Hold on.

401
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,691
We're getting
multiple readings.

402
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:54,360
There must be about a dozen
Bajoran prisoners down there.

403
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,611
What?!

404
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:01,200
Is there any way of beaming up
more than two at a time?

405
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,910
I'm afraid not.

406
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,537
As soon as we beam
the first two up,

407
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,622
all hell is going
to break loose in that camp.

408
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,249
There's no way of guaranteeing
that Li will be

409
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,585
one of the first two.

410
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,172
What's security like down there?

411
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:15,631
The compound is surrounded

412
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,842
by a standard
Cardassian forcefield.

413
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,012
We're going to have to land.

414
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:23,305
It's our only chance of getting
them all out of there.

415
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,308
I'll find us a secluded
place to put down.

416
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,687
(<i> distant voices</i> )

417
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,818
Back to work!

418
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,822
(<i> indistinct commands</i> )

419
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:57,757
(<i> distantly</i> ):
Do as I say!

420
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,389
How do I look?

421
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,516
I doubt there's
a Cardassian alive

422
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:08,976
who could resist you.

423
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,561
I hope you're right.

424
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:12,354
So do I.

425
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,481
No talking!

426
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:19,195
Halt!

427
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:21,405
We want to see the Prefect.

428
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,740
What for?

429
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:26,452
She has an appointment
with him.

430
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:30,123
I used to be stationed on Bajor.

431
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:31,331
Then you know
why the Prefect

432
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:34,252
doesn't want
to be kept waiting, huh?

433
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:36,963
What's this all about?

434
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:39,048
I'm not quite sure.

435
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:41,259
What would it cost me
for an appointment?

436
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:43,094
More than you
could afford.

437
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:45,304
Two strips
of gold-pressed latinum--

438
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,722
she's all yours.

439
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,224
He wouldn't know
what to do with me.

440
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:49,809
She needs disciplining.

441
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,685
From a boy like you? Ha!

442
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,688
I don't think
you're capable of it.

443
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,482
Step back.

444
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,484
I want to examine
what I'm paying for.

445
00:21:58,484 --> 00:21:59,652
Sure, sure

446
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,904
but no sampling
the merchandise

447
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,405
until the sale's
complete, okay?

448
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,283
Come here.

449
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:22,258
Now...
show me why

450
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:26,179
you're worth two strips
of gold-pressed latinum.

451
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:29,140
All right.

452
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:33,602
(<i> grunts</i> )

453
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,068
(<i> yells</i> )

454
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:52,370
Li Nalas!

455
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,831
Who are you?

456
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:55,041
Major Kira Nerys.

457
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,709
We've come to get you
out of here.

458
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,127
The earring--
you got it.

459
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,503
KIRA:
Yes.

460
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,297
I don't understand.
My earring was lost.

461
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:03,757
No, I had it smuggled
back to Bajor.

462
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,302
Gentlemen, I suggest you keep
this discussion for later, okay?

463
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:08,012
KIRA:
Come on.

464
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:13,893
Oh!

465
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:20,900
(<i> yells</i> )

466
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:27,198
Come on, we have
a ship waiting.

467
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,913
Let's get him
behind those rocks.

468
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:40,920
CARDASSIAN:
I see them!

469
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,422
Keep down.

470
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,429
We'll never make it
at this rate.

471
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:54,850
Get Li back to Bajor.

472
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,518
Four of us will stay behind
and hold them off

473
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:57,603
till you reach
your ship.

474
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:58,854
No, I won't allow it.

475
00:23:58,854 --> 00:23:59,897
Don't you see?

476
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:01,607
We did this for<i> you!</i>

477
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,609
Just get him
back safely.

478
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:04,610
That's all that counts.

479
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,819
You have my word.

480
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,196
All right, go.
Come on.

481
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:08,530
Go!
Come on.

482
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:32,346
Come on!

483
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:35,473
Ready to launch, Major.

484
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:38,394
Not yet, some of the others
might still make it.

485
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:40,313
Standing by.

486
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:46,193
I'm picking up two Galor-class
warships entering orbit.

487
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:49,905
They should be overhead
in one minute, 45 seconds.

488
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:53,491
Major, you can't leave
those men behind.

489
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:57,371
O'BRIEN:
One minute,
30 seconds.

490
00:24:57,371 --> 00:25:00,624
If we don't leave now, Major,
we never will.

491
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:05,379
Take us home, Chief.

492
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:07,340
Yes, sir.

493
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,926
<i>( ship powering up )</i>

494
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,730
Careful, he took
a phaser hit.

495
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,608
Easy now, I have you.

496
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,403
Doctor, these people have been
prisoners for ten years.

497
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:30,946
They need medical attention.
They'll get it,

498
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,948
but first, I better take
a look at this wound.

499
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,992
Bashir to Dax.<i> </i>
<i>Go ahead, Doctor.</i>

500
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:36,076
We've got a patient

501
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,161
who needs
emergency treatment.

502
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:38,912
Beam us to
the Infirmary.

503
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:40,122
<i>Stand by.</i>

504
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,712
Commander, I need to talk...

505
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:49,547
SISKO:
Ah, Major, I'm glad
you could join us.

506
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:53,427
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were busy.

507
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:54,761
Apparently not.

508
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,222
I'll just wait outside.

509
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:57,597
Hold on, Major.

510
00:25:57,597 --> 00:26:00,017
There's something
I want you to hear.

511
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,852
Go ahead, Dukat.

512
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:06,065
<i>Major, I have just informed</i>
<i>Commander Sisko</i>

513
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:10,568
<i>that the Cardassian High</i>
<i>Command has issued</i>
<i>a formal apology</i>

514
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:13,531
<i>to the people of Bajor.</i>

515
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:14,907
An apology?

516
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,784
<i>We had no idea</i>
<i>that Bajoran prisoners</i>

517
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:21,414
<i>were still being held</i>
<i>on Cardassia IV.</i>

518
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:24,666
<i>Such detentions</i>
<i>are a direct violation</i>

519
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:28,504
<i>of Supreme Directive 2645.</i>

520
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:30,923
<i>And I assure you</i>

521
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:35,344
<i>the camp Prefect</i>
<i>will be chastised accordingly.</i>

522
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:38,347
What about the prisoners
that were left behind?

523
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:41,975
<i>They are already en route</i>
<i>to Bajor.</i>

524
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:47,231
Well, I look forward
to their safe return.

525
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:48,690
<i>I'm sure you do.</i>

526
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:52,194
<i>And I hope</i>
<i>that our quick response</i>

527
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:57,450
<i>to this unfortunate situation</i>
<i>will prove once and for all</i>

528
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:00,994
<i>that Cardassia</i>
<i>is no longer your enemy.</i>

529
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:04,664
Commander?

530
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,792
I'm as surprised as you are.

531
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:10,421
There's got to be a reason

532
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:12,256
why they're being
so accommodating.

533
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,549
I'm sure there is

534
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:16,135
but until we can figure out
their motives,

535
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,511
let us just be grateful

536
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,679
that all the prisoners
are being returned safely.

537
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,476
Congratulations on the success
of your mission, Major.

538
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:32,650
There, that
should do it.

539
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,528
How do you feel?

540
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,991
(<i> sighing</i> )

541
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,200
Better.

542
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,453
Good.

543
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:43,661
Luckily, your wound
wasn't as serious

544
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:44,913
as it looked.

545
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:47,040
You've probably
had a lot worse.

546
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,794
Well, actually,
this one was bad enough.

547
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,463
You know, I've read
all about your battle

548
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:54,089
with Gul Zarale.

549
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,216
That was a long time ago.

550
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,302
Well, I consider myself
a bit of a history buff,

551
00:27:58,302 --> 00:27:59,677
and I must say
some of the campaigns

552
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:01,472
you led against
the Cardassians

553
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:02,598
were truly remarkable...

554
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:05,518
Doctor, I think
that you'll find

555
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:08,686
that others enjoy talking
about those days

556
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:10,356
far more than I do.

557
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:12,525
Of course.

558
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:14,776
I understand
completely.

559
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:20,698
Amazing.

560
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,034
What is?

561
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:23,536
Being here.

562
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:25,037
I used to work

563
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:27,789
in one of this station's
ore-processing plants.

564
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:28,957
I think you will find

565
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,001
that things have changed
considerably.

566
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:33,920
Commander, a transport
carrying Minister Jaro

567
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,506
has just arrived from Bajor.

568
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:36,590
Major

569
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,592
I think you should
have the honor

570
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:40,469
of welcoming him aboard.

571
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:41,554
Thank you, Commander.

572
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:45,849
If you're hungry

573
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:49,144
the Replimat has some
passable Bajoran food.

574
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,356
LI:
Actually,
I'm a bit tired.

575
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:54,107
I think I'd like
to see my quarters.

576
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,442
Of course.

577
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:56,818
(<i> whispering</i> ):
That's Li Nalas.

578
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:03,450
It appears you've
been recognized.

579
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:10,832
Minister Jaro.

580
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,459
Major.

581
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,877
Where is he?

582
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,379
He's on the Promenade
with Commander Sisko.

583
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:16,630
And he's all right?

584
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,048
Considering what
he's been through

585
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:19,299
in the past ten years.

586
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,427
Li Nalas alive--

587
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:23,512
who would have
ever imagined?

588
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:25,556
The Prophets were kind
to you today, Major.

589
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:28,225
I'd, uh, say they were
kind to all of us.

590
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:29,893
You know,
your little adventure

591
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:32,396
made you some enemies
in the Chamber of Ministers.

592
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:33,522
I'm not surprised.

593
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:34,856
All I did was
risk my life.

594
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,650
What you did
today, Major,

595
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,611
was declare war
on Cardassia.

596
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:40,362
Thankfully, they declined
the invitation.

597
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:43,490
I'd do it again if it meant
bringing Li Nalas home.

598
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,742
Yes, I'm sure you would.

599
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:46,326
Although, officially,
I have to warn you

600
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,620
that the next time
you disobey orders

601
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:51,123
will mean the end
of your military career.

602
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,542
As a private citizen...

603
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:56,253
I want to thank you
for what you've done this day.

604
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:00,340
That's good to hear.

605
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,008
Now take me
to see Li Nalas.

606
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,348
ODO:
Move it back, please.

607
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,267
No pushing, no pushing.

608
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,436
I'm sorry about this, Commander.

609
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:15,230
I don't think they're
going to leave

610
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,316
until you say
a few words.

611
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:18,358
I agree.

612
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:26,366
If that's what it takes.

613
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:34,583
It's good to be free.

614
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:40,422
It's good to know that...

615
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:43,383
after all our years
of struggle...

616
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:47,971
...Bajor is finally free.

617
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,598
JARO:
Yes, it is good to be free.

618
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:51,850
Well...

619
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,103
it really is you, isn't it?

620
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,271
Li Nalas.

621
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,273
I'm Minister Jaro Essa,

622
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:59,525
and I can't tell you

623
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:01,360
how delighted I am
to welcome you home.

624
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,445
Believe me, it is
a pleasure to be here.

625
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:06,156
Would you mind if I
address the crowd?

626
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:07,449
You can't expect
a politician

627
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:09,660
to give up an opportunity
like this.

628
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,370
You go right ahead.

629
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,996
Thank you.

630
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:18,293
Fellow Bajorans, I have
only one thing to say to you--

631
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:19,919
to ask you, really.

632
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,548
Never forget this moment,

633
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:24,132
because I promise you

634
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,802
that one day, your children
and your grandchildren

635
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,887
will ask you what it was like

636
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,473
the day Li Nalas
returned to Bajor.

637
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:34,643
(<i> buzz of agreement</i> )

638
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:45,987
I hope you'll find these
quarters satisfactory.

639
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:52,035
Commander...

640
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:57,249
I just spent ten years
in a Cardassian labor camp.

641
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:00,919
I'm just grateful...

642
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,714
for a moment's privacy.

643
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:06,216
Enjoy it
while you can.

644
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:08,385
Judging from the crowd
on the Promenade,

645
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:10,554
a moment may be
all you get.

646
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:17,352
I thought they would have
forgotten me by now.

647
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,812
It appears
you were wrong.

648
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,524
This morning, I was a slave.

649
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:27,821
Tonight, I am a hero.

650
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:30,323
It must seem
a little overwhelming.

651
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:33,452
I tell you what is
overwhelming, Commander.

652
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:39,332
It's knowing that something
I have waited for my whole life

653
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:42,544
has finally happened.

654
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:44,588
The Cardassians are gone.

655
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:45,964
We won.

656
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:51,637
You've been there recently.

657
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:57,309
What's it like,
a free Bajor?

658
00:32:57,309 --> 00:33:02,188
I think you'll be pleased,
for the most part.

659
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:03,315
For the most part?

660
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:06,359
Bajor lacks
strong leadership.

661
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,656
So that's what
Major Kira meant.

662
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:17,329
On the runabout, she
told me that my return

663
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:20,206
would bring
stability to Bajor.

664
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,750
She's right.

665
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,544
Bajor could use your help,
and frankly, so could I.

666
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:30,091
But before you go
off saving Bajor,

667
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,260
I suppose you could use
a good night's sleep.

668
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:40,560
It sounds like
I'm going to need it.

669
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:49,862
(<i> sighs</i> )

670
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,949
QUARK:
One for you...

671
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:56,159
and six for me.

672
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,497
One for you and...

673
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:02,624
six for me.

674
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,210
One for you...

675
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,879
and six for me.

676
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:09,297
Would you stop
looking so glum?

677
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:12,509
Payday is supposed
to be a time of... joy.

678
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:14,511
I know, brother

679
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:16,555
but, every week,
it's the same thing.

680
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,515
Six for you
and only one for me.

681
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:21,142
It's not fair!

682
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:24,145
You're right.

683
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,480
I am?

684
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,525
Yes. It's not fair.

685
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:29,568
It's not?

686
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,486
Absolutely not.

687
00:34:35,032 --> 00:34:37,283
One for you...

688
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,827
and...

689
00:34:40,037 --> 00:34:41,329
...seven

690
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,873
for me.

691
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,793
One for you, and...

692
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,336
seven for me.

693
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,005
Is that better?

694
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:53,926
And where
are you going?

695
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:58,597
To bed, to dream
of an equal share of profits.

696
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,015
Dream on.

697
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:04,019
(<i> door opens and closes</i> )

698
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:05,979
One for you...

699
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:08,941
and seven for me.

700
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:10,108
(<i> door opens</i> )

701
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,985
What is it now?

702
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,070
(<i> grunting</i> )

703
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:18,992
(<i> muffled yelling</i> )

704
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:29,502
BASHIR:
Quark... Quark!
Hold still.

705
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:32,714
Doctor...

706
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:35,425
will there be a scar?

707
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:36,676
I said, hold still.

708
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,219
Does that mean yes?

709
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,221
No, this dermal
regenerator

710
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,932
should repair any
damaged tissue

711
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:43,642
as well as prevent
scarring.

712
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,018
Unless, of course,

713
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:47,771
you don't hold<i> still.</i>

714
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,940
Did you recognize any
of your assailants?

715
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,608
They were wearing masks.

716
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:54,027
Are you sure they didn't
say anything?

717
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:55,278
Not a word.

718
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,780
They came in,
branded me, and left.

719
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,032
The Promenade is usually
deserted at this hour.

720
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:01,076
No one saw them
enter or leave.

721
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:03,369
Constable, I want
all security personnel

722
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:04,454
put on full alert.

723
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:06,039
I've already seen to it.

724
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:08,166
Who was responsible
for this?

725
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,168
An extremist group
from Bajor

726
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:13,005
who call themselves
the Circle.

727
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:15,173
Bajorans did this?

728
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,967
I'm afraid so.

729
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:19,218
But why?

730
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:23,640
Their goal is to rid Bajor
of all non-Bajorans.

731
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,767
Hasn't the provisional
government

732
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:26,977
tried to stop them?

733
00:36:26,977 --> 00:36:28,979
Oh, they've tried,
but the truth is

734
00:36:28,979 --> 00:36:31,898
the Circle is more organized
than the government.

735
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,650
Well, the government
better get organized

736
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,819
because I intend to sue them
for financial compensation.

737
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:36,903
Not now, Quark!

738
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:39,739
People have grown impatient

739
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:42,659
with the government's inability
to get things done

740
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:44,786
so they turn
to the Circle.

741
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:45,912
Constable.

742
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,833
We need someone
to speak out

743
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,668
against these
reactionaries--

744
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:54,087
someone the people
will listen to.

745
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,090
BASHIR:
There.

746
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,675
That should do it.

747
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,098
(<i> sighing</i> )

748
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:08,351
How do I look?

749
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:11,437
As... handsome as ever.

750
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,736
Really?

751
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:18,904
Huh.

752
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:21,239
Huh.

753
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:24,868
(<i> yawning</i> )

754
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:27,746
Jake, what are
you doing up?

755
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:30,456
I couldn't sleep.

756
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:32,625
How was your date?

757
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:35,545
It<i> was</i> tonight,
wasn't it?

758
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:37,130
It was supposed to be.

759
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,257
She couldn't make it.

760
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,509
It happens.

761
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,719
She said her father

762
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:45,013
wouldn't let her
go out with me.

763
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,556
Why not?

764
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:49,809
Because I'm not a Bajoran.

765
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,062
(<i> sighs</i> )

766
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:56,024
That's not much of a reason.

767
00:37:58,193 --> 00:37:59,736
Oh, Jake.

768
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:06,325
There are some things
happening on Bajor.

769
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:08,661
Troubling things.

770
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:15,043
I'm sorry you've become
a victim of them.

771
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:17,629
You don't deserve it.

772
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:19,422
Nobody does.

773
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:31,643
Time for bed, okay?

774
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:33,645
Okay.

775
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:34,938
(<i> yawns</i> )

776
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:36,231
Night, Dad.

777
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:43,321
COM OFFICER:
<i>Commander, there's</i>
<i>a call for you</i>

778
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:47,366
<i>from the Tygarian freighter</i>
<i>docked on Upper Pylon 2.</i>

779
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:49,119
Put it through.

780
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,330
<i>Commander Sisko,</i>
<i>I am Romah Doek,</i>

781
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,332
<i>Executive Officer of the</i> Nanut.

782
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,627
<i>We were preparing to depart</i>
<i>this station for Gamma Quadrant</i>

783
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:59,504
<i>when we discovered</i>
<i>a Bajoran citizen</i>

784
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:01,965
<i>trying to stow away</i>
<i>on our ship.</i>

785
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:04,759
<i>I was hoping you would know</i>
<i>what to do with him.</i>

786
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,228
The<i> Nanut</i> isn't scheduled

787
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:18,315
to return from the Gamma
Quadrant for two years.

788
00:39:18,315 --> 00:39:19,440
Actually, I planned

789
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,650
on staying
considerably longer.

790
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,110
I don't follow.

791
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:27,282
(<i> sighs</i> )

792
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:35,248
Commander, I'm going
to tell you a story...

793
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:37,667
and you may
even believe it.

794
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:39,294
I'm listening.

795
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:40,920
During the occupation,

796
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,715
I was a member of a
minor resistance cell.

797
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:44,966
Name's unimportant.

798
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:47,260
One day-- this was
in the mountains

799
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,428
surrounding the
Sahving Valley--

800
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:51,973
we were ambushed
by Cardassian troops.

801
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:55,268
Only three of us
managed to escape.

802
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:56,728
We hid in the hills
for two days.

803
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:59,356
Finally, the lack
of food and water

804
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:00,982
forced us down
into the valley.

805
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:05,320
We made our way to a ridge
overlooking a small lake.

806
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,365
As I was the only one
still carrying a phaser

807
00:40:08,365 --> 00:40:11,034
I went on ahead
to scout for the enemy.

808
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:14,453
Halfway down the embankment,
I slipped...

809
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:16,455
went sprawling on my back
down to the edge of the lake

810
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:19,334
just as a huge Cardassian
emerged from the water.

811
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:21,920
He must have
just finished bathing.

812
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,171
He stood there...

813
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:24,297
frozen in surprise

814
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:26,383
dressed only
in his underwear,

815
00:40:26,383 --> 00:40:28,634
shivering in the cold.

816
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:31,637
I lay there, looking up at him,
too stunned to even move.

817
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:35,474
And it was only when he reached
for a phaser rifle

818
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:37,685
that was lying across
his clothes on a nearby rock

819
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,313
that I realized that I was
still holding my own phaser,

820
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:42,107
and I shot him.

821
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:44,567
His body fell on top of me.

822
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:47,528
And that's how my companions
found us a moment later.

823
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:51,866
One of them recognized him
as, uh, Gul Zarale,

824
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:54,994
responsible for the massacre
of half a dozen

825
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,662
Bajoran villages.

826
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:59,124
Now, I tried to tell
them what had happened,

827
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:00,959
but they had already
convinced themselves

828
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:06,005
that I had killed Zarale in
some kind of a savage struggle,

829
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,173
which is what they insisted

830
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:09,842
on telling every
Bajoran that we met.

831
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:12,678
And no matter how hard
I tried to deny it,

832
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,306
the story continued to spread

833
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:16,975
until it seemed
all of Bajor had heard it.

834
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:19,894
Soon every victory
won by the resistance

835
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:22,355
was attributed to my leadership.

836
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:26,525
Stories of my brilliance,
my daring, my courage

837
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,945
grew more and more unbelievable

838
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:31,948
yet the people
insisted on believing them.

839
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:34,451
My reputation even followed me
into the labor camp

840
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:38,537
where my mere presence seemed
to inspire my fellow prisoners.

841
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,748
And I had done<i> nothing</i>

842
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:46,212
but shoot an unarmed Cardassian
in his underwear.

843
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:49,632
I'll never forget the look
on his face when he died.

844
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:54,095
He was so... embarrassed.

845
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:56,139
So you see, Commander

846
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:59,600
I have done
what Bajor needed me to do.

847
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,102
I have allowed myself

848
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:05,606
to be a slave to my reputation
all of these years.

849
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:06,941
And now...

850
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:09,944
it is enough.

851
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:13,739
They still need you.

852
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:18,911
But I am not the man
that they think I am.

853
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:21,206
Perhaps not.

854
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:24,334
But Bajor
doesn't need a man.

855
00:42:24,334 --> 00:42:26,002
It needs a symbol,

856
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:27,753
and that's
what you are.

857
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:31,007
No one's asking you
to lead troops into battle

858
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:33,009
or to kill
a hundred Cardassians

859
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:35,220
with your bare hands.

860
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:38,806
I saw you...

861
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:42,143
in front of the crowd
on the Promenade.

862
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:44,020
They look at you

863
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:49,317
and they see strength
and honor and decency.

864
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:53,363
They look at you and see
the best in themselves.

865
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:57,409
But it's all based on a lie.

866
00:42:57,409 --> 00:43:00,703
No. It's based
on a legend.

867
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:04,207
And legends
are as powerful

868
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:05,666
as any truth.

869
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:09,212
Bajor still needs
that legend.

870
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:11,089
It needs<i> you.</i>

871
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:23,393
DAX:
The Yelikan transport
is ready for departure.

872
00:43:23,393 --> 00:43:27,522
Opening mooring clamps
on Docking Bay Six.

873
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:28,856
Major.

874
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:36,822
Commander.

875
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:38,074
Minister Jaro.

876
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:39,075
Li.

877
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:40,368
Navarch Li--

878
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:42,537
as of yesterday's
unanimous assembly vote.

879
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:44,080
Congratulations.

880
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,164
Navarch...

881
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,707
there's never
been one before.

882
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:49,461
They felt any existing title
was inadequate,

883
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:51,588
so they created
a new one for me.

884
00:43:51,588 --> 00:43:53,339
I hear that thousands
of people showed up

885
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,592
to greet your ship
when it arrived on Bajor.

886
00:43:55,592 --> 00:43:57,594
Yes, it was
quite a celebration.

887
00:43:57,594 --> 00:43:59,678
I wish I could
have stayed longer.

888
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:01,514
SISKO:
Why? What stopped you?

889
00:44:01,514 --> 00:44:03,600
JARO:
The Navarch needed to return
here to assume his new post.

890
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,936
He's been made the Bajoran
Liaison Officer to Deep Space 9.

891
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:09,730
I already have
a liaison officer.

892
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,316
JARO:
Not anymore,
you don't.

893
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:14,152
Major Kira is no longer
assigned to this post.

894
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:16,279
She's been recalled to Bajor.
