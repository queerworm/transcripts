1
00:00:15,055 --> 00:00:16,888
Dabo!

2
00:00:17,927 --> 00:00:19,122
Quark!

3
00:00:19,163 --> 00:00:20,290
Oh... not now, Odo.

4
00:00:20,332 --> 00:00:21,664
We have to talk.

5
00:00:21,702 --> 00:00:22,670
It'll have to wait.

6
00:00:22,704 --> 00:00:23,672
It can't wait.

7
00:00:23,706 --> 00:00:25,642
Of course not.

8
00:00:25,677 --> 00:00:26,645
Make it fast.

9
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:28,512
I have business to attend to.

10
00:00:28,549 --> 00:00:30,883
You remember
that Subytt freighter

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,149
we were discussing
the other day...

12
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:34,659
the one you claimed
was smuggling

13
00:00:34,695 --> 00:00:36,892
defective isolinear rods
to Bajor?

14
00:00:36,932 --> 00:00:38,230
Yes, yes.
What about it?

15
00:00:38,335 --> 00:00:39,234
Well, I conducted

16
00:00:39,337 --> 00:00:41,534
a little investigation
of that freighter

17
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:44,240
and do you know
what I discovered?

18
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,220
That I was telling the truth.

19
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:52,251
That's right.

20
00:00:52,363 --> 00:00:55,130
I arrested the First Officer
and two of the crew.

21
00:00:55,168 --> 00:00:56,534
Congratulations, Constable.

22
00:00:56,572 --> 00:00:57,767
I knew you could do it.

23
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:01,211
Now, if you don't mind,
I am needed upstairs.

24
00:01:01,247 --> 00:01:02,715
Hold on.

25
00:01:02,751 --> 00:01:05,153
I'm not finished with you.

26
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:06,919
Oh, really, Odo?

27
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:08,724
Sometimes I think
there's no pleasing you.

28
00:01:08,763 --> 00:01:11,496
I help you crack
a notorious smuggling ring

29
00:01:11,534 --> 00:01:15,099
and yet you still insist on
treating me like the enemy?

30
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:17,169
You are the enemy.

31
00:01:17,212 --> 00:01:20,582
Then how do you explain
my helping you?

32
00:01:21,922 --> 00:01:23,254
That's just it.

33
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:26,024
I can't explain it.

34
00:01:26,063 --> 00:01:27,828
It's simple, really.

35
00:01:27,867 --> 00:01:30,839
I figured we've been at each
others' throats long enough.

36
00:01:30,873 --> 00:01:32,843
It's time we called a truce.

37
00:01:32,877 --> 00:01:34,038
Truce?

38
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,605
You must be joking.

39
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,918
Ask the Subytt First Officer
if I'm joking.

40
00:01:38,956 --> 00:01:40,949
From now on, you and I
are going to be friends.

41
00:01:42,362 --> 00:01:44,798
You're up to something.

42
00:01:44,835 --> 00:01:46,303
Why would you say that?

43
00:01:46,337 --> 00:01:48,807
Because you're always
up to something.

44
00:01:48,843 --> 00:01:51,815
I can see this is
going to take time

45
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:54,821
but eventually you'll
learn to trust me.

46
00:01:54,855 --> 00:01:56,688
Hmm, hmm.

47
00:01:56,725 --> 00:01:58,490
That'll be the day.

48
00:02:07,312 --> 00:02:09,782
I don't think I can remember

49
00:02:09,818 --> 00:02:12,881
Odo ever looking so...
perplexed.

50
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,392
He's not alone.

51
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:15,894
Those Subytt smugglers

52
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,561
were a potential source
of great profit.

53
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:21,801
Must I quote you
the 76th Rule of Acquisition?

54
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:23,140
The 76th...

55
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:26,149
"Every once in a while,
declare peace.

56
00:02:26,183 --> 00:02:29,417
It confuses the hell
out of your enemies."

57
00:02:43,886 --> 00:02:45,218
Hi, Quark.

58
00:02:45,255 --> 00:02:47,725
How are your lobes?

59
00:02:48,796 --> 00:02:52,736
Tingling at the sight of you.

60
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,367
What'll it be, hmm?

61
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:57,378
Another black hole?

62
00:02:57,412 --> 00:02:59,382
No, I don't have time.

63
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:01,386
My ship's about to pull out.

64
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,322
Do you know of anyone
going to Bajor?

65
00:03:03,358 --> 00:03:06,125
Ships go back and forth
from there all the time.

66
00:03:06,163 --> 00:03:07,461
Why?

67
00:03:07,499 --> 00:03:11,530
I promised someone
I'd deliver this for them.

68
00:03:11,574 --> 00:03:14,044
Doesn't look like I'm going
to get there this trip.

69
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:16,481
It's an earring.

70
00:03:16,517 --> 00:03:17,849
I know it's an earring.

71
00:03:17,887 --> 00:03:20,255
It was given to me
by a maintenance worker

72
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,657
on Cardassia IV.

73
00:03:21,694 --> 00:03:25,964
Are you saying a Cardassian
gave you a Bajoran earring?

74
00:03:26,003 --> 00:03:28,371
He asked me to take it to Bajor.

75
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,674
Said whoever I showed
it to would understand.

76
00:03:30,713 --> 00:03:32,546
He said that?

77
00:03:32,582 --> 00:03:34,552
Well, this is a Bajoran
station, isn't it?

78
00:03:34,586 --> 00:03:35,554
Mm-hmm.

79
00:03:35,588 --> 00:03:39,119
Well, there must be someone here

80
00:03:39,163 --> 00:03:40,962
who would know
what to do with it.

81
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,400
Oh, there is.

82
00:03:42,469 --> 00:03:43,869
Who?

83
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:48,438
Me.

84
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,295
Come in.

85
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,069
Surprise.

86
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:21,511
What do you want?

87
00:04:21,547 --> 00:04:23,813
I always wondered what
your quarters looked like.

88
00:04:23,852 --> 00:04:25,822
That better not be
your only reason for being here.

89
00:04:25,856 --> 00:04:27,826
You don't entertain much,
do you?

90
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,192
Oh, I entertain a lot...

91
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:30,629
I just don't entertain you.

92
00:04:30,665 --> 00:04:32,965
Let me guess.

93
00:04:33,004 --> 00:04:34,837
The bedroom.

94
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:36,707
You take one step in here

95
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:38,839
and I promise you,
it'll be your last.

96
00:04:38,882 --> 00:04:41,011
It could be worth it.

97
00:04:41,053 --> 00:04:43,023
You've got five seconds
to tell me what you want.

98
00:04:43,057 --> 00:04:44,890
Aren't you going
to offer me a beverage?

99
00:04:44,928 --> 00:04:46,693
Five... four...

100
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,359
Can we at least sit down?

101
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:51,339
Three, two, one.

102
00:04:51,373 --> 00:04:52,671
Wait!

103
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,681
I brought you something.

104
00:04:58,154 --> 00:04:59,714
Where did you get that?

105
00:04:59,756 --> 00:05:01,088
Is it valuable?

106
00:05:01,126 --> 00:05:02,891
I said where did you get it?

107
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,729
From a Boslic Freighter Captain.

108
00:05:04,766 --> 00:05:06,702
She got it from a Cardassian.

109
00:05:06,737 --> 00:05:07,762
Where?

110
00:05:07,806 --> 00:05:09,274
On Cardassia IV.

111
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,142
That's what she told me, anyway.

112
00:05:17,994 --> 00:05:19,987
Consider it a gift!

113
00:07:20,334 --> 00:07:22,327
Hey, Dad, wait up.

114
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:25,309
You got a minute?

115
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:26,812
For you, absolutely.

116
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:28,315
I've got some great news.

117
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,818
You passed your algebra test.

118
00:07:29,853 --> 00:07:30,843
Better than that.

119
00:07:30,888 --> 00:07:32,858
You learned how to hit
Bob Gibson's fastball.

120
00:07:32,892 --> 00:07:33,860
No, even better.

121
00:07:33,894 --> 00:07:35,523
Better than hitting
Gibson's fastball?

122
00:07:35,564 --> 00:07:36,657
This I want to hear.

123
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,294
You remember that Bajoran
girl I told you about?

124
00:07:38,337 --> 00:07:39,430
The one
with the beautiful smile?

125
00:07:39,472 --> 00:07:41,374
That's right... Laira.

126
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,469
I decided to ask her out.

127
00:07:42,512 --> 00:07:43,480
Well, good for you.

128
00:07:43,514 --> 00:07:45,108
And now you've come
to the old man

129
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,745
for advice
on what to say to her.

130
00:07:46,787 --> 00:07:47,846
Dad, I al...

131
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:49,722
The main thing is you can't
be afraid of rejection.

132
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,991
Dad, I already asked her
out, and she said yes.

133
00:07:52,031 --> 00:07:53,694
She did?
That's wonderful.

134
00:07:53,734 --> 00:07:54,702
I was just wondering

135
00:07:54,736 --> 00:07:56,467
if you had any ideas
on what we could do.

136
00:07:56,506 --> 00:07:58,772
I was thinking of taking her
to the holosuites.

137
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,838
The holosuites?
I don't think so.

138
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:02,042
Why not?

139
00:08:02,084 --> 00:08:03,143
Because you're too young

140
00:08:03,187 --> 00:08:04,621
to take a girl
to the holosuites.

141
00:08:04,656 --> 00:08:07,058
Okay, then how about if I
take her to our quarters?

142
00:08:07,094 --> 00:08:08,323
Oh, no, no.

143
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:09,331
No quarters.

144
00:08:09,365 --> 00:08:10,833
We're just going to talk.

145
00:08:10,868 --> 00:08:12,166
Talk in public.

146
00:08:12,205 --> 00:08:13,936
It's not the same.

147
00:08:13,974 --> 00:08:15,374
You want to talk?

148
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:16,777
Take her upstairs.

149
00:08:16,813 --> 00:08:18,179
And that way you can talk

150
00:08:18,283 --> 00:08:20,880
and watch the ships
go through the wormhole.

151
00:08:20,921 --> 00:08:21,911
That's boring.

152
00:08:21,957 --> 00:08:22,947
Since when?

153
00:08:22,992 --> 00:08:24,392
Since I started
going out with girls.

154
00:08:24,429 --> 00:08:26,399
This is your first date.

155
00:08:26,433 --> 00:08:28,699
And I don't want it
to be my last.

156
00:08:28,737 --> 00:08:30,366
Commander,
I need to speak with you.

157
00:08:30,407 --> 00:08:31,670
One moment, Major.

158
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:35,377
I can see you're not ready
to have this conversation yet.

159
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:36,885
I'm not ready?

160
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,356
I'll just have to come up
with a few ideas on my own.

161
00:08:39,392 --> 00:08:41,055
Really, don't worry about it.

162
00:08:41,096 --> 00:08:43,225
Who's worried?

163
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,495
Commander?

164
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,565
Join me, Major.

165
00:08:53,453 --> 00:08:57,154
One <i>raktajino</i>
with a <i>jacarine</i> peel.

166
00:08:57,194 --> 00:08:59,096
Nothing for me.

167
00:09:07,181 --> 00:09:09,208
One icoberry torte.

168
00:09:12,925 --> 00:09:15,624
So... Major

169
00:09:15,664 --> 00:09:17,634
what can I do for you?

170
00:09:17,668 --> 00:09:19,228
I need to borrow a runabout.

171
00:09:19,272 --> 00:09:20,262
For what?

172
00:09:21,276 --> 00:09:23,473
You really don't want
to ask me that.

173
00:09:23,513 --> 00:09:24,481
It's too late.

174
00:09:24,515 --> 00:09:25,847
I already asked.

175
00:09:25,884 --> 00:09:27,854
You don't want
to know the answer.

176
00:09:27,888 --> 00:09:30,358
Major, I can't loan you
a Starfleet runabout

177
00:09:30,394 --> 00:09:32,387
without knowing
where you plan on taking it.

178
00:09:34,902 --> 00:09:39,309
To Cardassia IV to rescue
a Bajoran prisoner of war.

179
00:09:42,284 --> 00:09:44,481
You're right.

180
00:09:44,522 --> 00:09:45,922
I wish you hadn't told me.

181
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,953
This earring was recently
smuggled off the planet.

182
00:09:48,997 --> 00:09:50,465
Do you see this?

183
00:09:50,501 --> 00:09:53,564
That is the insignia
of Li Nalas.

184
00:09:53,607 --> 00:09:55,304
The resistance leader?

185
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,505
The greatest we ever had.

186
00:09:56,546 --> 00:09:58,311
His victory over Gul Zarale
in hand-to-hand combat...

187
00:09:58,417 --> 00:09:59,749
Major, I have already
heard the story.

188
00:09:59,786 --> 00:10:02,018
Wasn't he reported
killed in action?

189
00:10:02,057 --> 00:10:03,754
His body was never found.

190
00:10:03,794 --> 00:10:06,322
Look, Commander,
I wouldn't be asking you this

191
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,200
if I thought there was
any other way to rescue Li.

192
00:10:09,238 --> 00:10:11,869
But Bajoran ships just don't
have the maneuverability

193
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,344
or the defensive capabilities

194
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,682
to get me safely in and out
of Cardassian territory.

195
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:21,588
You're sure this is genuine?

196
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:23,724
Dax found dermal residue
on the backing.

197
00:10:23,767 --> 00:10:26,364
A genetic analysis matched
it to Li's DNA records.

198
00:10:26,473 --> 00:10:27,702
It's genuine all right.

199
00:10:27,742 --> 00:10:30,646
Have you told
the provisional government?

200
00:10:30,681 --> 00:10:33,380
I contacted three ministers.

201
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,722
Their response was
exactly what I expected.

202
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,391
In other words,
they're unwilling

203
00:10:39,432 --> 00:10:43,702
to risk going to war
with Cardassia over an earring.

204
00:10:45,844 --> 00:10:48,110
I can't say I blame them.

205
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:52,056
Commander, you and I both know
the provisional government

206
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:54,424
is made up
of political opportunists

207
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,431
too busy
fighting amongst themselves

208
00:10:56,466 --> 00:10:58,595
to care what happens to Bajor.

209
00:10:58,637 --> 00:11:00,732
Since the loss of the Kai

210
00:11:00,774 --> 00:11:02,573
the situation has only
gone from bad to worse.

211
00:11:02,611 --> 00:11:04,547
There are reports
of factional fighting

212
00:11:04,582 --> 00:11:05,914
in half a dozen districts.

213
00:11:05,951 --> 00:11:08,855
Religious riots have spread
throughout the southern islands.

214
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,655
Bajor needs a leader...

215
00:11:10,694 --> 00:11:12,493
someone the people
will listen to

216
00:11:12,531 --> 00:11:13,863
someone they can trust.

217
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,997
And you think that Li Nalas
is that leader?

218
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,771
I know he is.

219
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,404
O'Brien to Sisko.

220
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,847
Go ahead, Chief.

221
00:11:21,883 --> 00:11:25,550
I think you and Odo had better
join me in the Habitat Ring

222
00:11:25,591 --> 00:11:26,991
level 13, section 4.

223
00:11:27,026 --> 00:11:29,223
There's something
you should see.

224
00:11:29,265 --> 00:11:30,825
We'll be right there.

225
00:11:33,138 --> 00:11:34,664
Do I get the runabout?

226
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,141
I'll have to think it over.

227
00:11:43,192 --> 00:11:45,458
I was on my way
to Crossover Bridge 3

228
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,626
to do some repair work
on the field modulators

229
00:11:47,668 --> 00:11:49,102
when I noticed this.

230
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:54,906
This is the emblem of the
Alliance for Global Unity.

231
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:56,247
They call themselves the Circle.

232
00:11:56,286 --> 00:11:58,347
The Circle, huh?

233
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,724
What gives them the right
to mess up our station?

234
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,229
They're an extremist faction

235
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:06,068
who believe in Bajor
for the Bajorans.

236
00:12:06,104 --> 00:12:07,402
All other species are inferior

237
00:12:07,441 --> 00:12:09,172
and should be expelled
from the planet.

238
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,612
I understand this emblem
has appeared all over Bajor.

239
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:12,674
That's correct

240
00:12:12,718 --> 00:12:15,120
but this is the first
time I've seen it here.

241
00:12:15,156 --> 00:12:16,454
I want to be informed
immediately

242
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:19,463
if this emblem appears
anyplace else on the station.

243
00:12:19,565 --> 00:12:20,828
Understood.

244
00:12:20,867 --> 00:12:22,393
If they think scrawling
a few signs

245
00:12:22,438 --> 00:12:23,599
is going to get rid of us

246
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,735
they've got
another thing coming.

247
00:12:25,777 --> 00:12:27,268
Right now, they're just
trying to show us

248
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:28,373
that we're vulnerable.

249
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,045
I wouldn't be overly
concerned, Commander.

250
00:12:30,086 --> 00:12:32,215
This section is
a low-security area.

251
00:12:32,257 --> 00:12:33,486
As of now, Constable

252
00:12:33,526 --> 00:12:36,794
there are no low-security areas
on this station.

253
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:52,462
You wanted to see me, Benjamin?

254
00:12:52,508 --> 00:12:53,874
Ah, yes.

255
00:12:53,911 --> 00:12:55,277
Have a seat.

256
00:12:55,347 --> 00:12:57,910
Am I to assume this is
going to be about baseball?

257
00:12:57,952 --> 00:12:59,215
Not this time.

258
00:12:59,254 --> 00:13:00,654
Good.

259
00:13:00,691 --> 00:13:02,661
I thought you enjoyed
talking about baseball.

260
00:13:02,695 --> 00:13:04,631
Curzon enjoyed it

261
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,968
but not half as much
as he led you to believe.

262
00:13:08,005 --> 00:13:10,373
So what's on your mind,
Benjamin?

263
00:13:10,411 --> 00:13:13,247
I've been thinking
about our mission here.

264
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,343
I look at the turmoil on Bajor

265
00:13:15,387 --> 00:13:17,789
and I see everything
we fought for this past year

266
00:13:17,825 --> 00:13:19,259
starting to unravel.

267
00:13:19,362 --> 00:13:21,161
I told you this was going
to be a tough assignment

268
00:13:21,198 --> 00:13:22,427
when we came here.

269
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,668
Of course, I didn't realize
it was going to be this tough.

270
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:28,201
What if I told you
that I knew someone

271
00:13:28,246 --> 00:13:30,546
who could bring stability
to Bajor?

272
00:13:30,584 --> 00:13:32,577
Someone who could
unite the factions

273
00:13:32,622 --> 00:13:34,592
and give us a chance
to do our job?

274
00:13:34,626 --> 00:13:37,119
I'd say give Kira the runabout.

275
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,933
How do you know
about Kira wanting a runabout?

276
00:13:40,971 --> 00:13:44,239
I promise not to tell.

277
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:45,610
All right.

278
00:13:45,648 --> 00:13:48,745
Supposing I do help
and she does rescue Li Nalas.

279
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:50,757
What do we say
to the Cardassians?

280
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,282
The question is

281
00:13:52,327 --> 00:13:54,194
what do they say to us?

282
00:13:54,231 --> 00:13:57,203
They swore they released
all their Bajoran prisoners.

283
00:14:23,055 --> 00:14:24,581
Chief...

284
00:14:24,626 --> 00:14:26,562
Major Kira needs a runabout.

285
00:14:26,596 --> 00:14:29,568
Oh, so she's going
to Cardassia IV after all.

286
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:32,335
Is there anyone on this station
she didn't tell?

287
00:14:32,408 --> 00:14:35,312
I doubt
she mentioned it to Quark.

288
00:14:35,346 --> 00:14:38,147
Well, then,
as far as Quark's concerned

289
00:14:38,185 --> 00:14:39,916
she's going to Lamenda Prime

290
00:14:39,956 --> 00:14:41,322
to bring back mineral samples.

291
00:14:41,358 --> 00:14:42,348
I see.

292
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:43,793
Now, is there any way
we can prevent

293
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,196
the Cardassian sensors

294
00:14:45,233 --> 00:14:47,032
from picking up
the runabout's signature?

295
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,131
I could modulate
the engine's power emissions

296
00:14:49,174 --> 00:14:51,474
reconfigure
the deflector shield grid

297
00:14:51,513 --> 00:14:52,674
and install field buffers

298
00:14:52,715 --> 00:14:54,275
around the subspace
emitter coil.

299
00:14:54,318 --> 00:14:56,379
By the time I'm done,
the Cardassians will think

300
00:14:56,423 --> 00:14:58,188
they're picking up
a Lissepian transport.

301
00:14:58,225 --> 00:14:59,284
Yeah?

302
00:14:59,328 --> 00:15:03,291
I see you've already given this
a bit of thought.

303
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:04,862
I suppose I have.

304
00:15:14,157 --> 00:15:15,352
Come in.

305
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,766
Commander... Chief.

306
00:15:20,804 --> 00:15:22,364
I was just getting ready
to leave.

307
00:15:22,407 --> 00:15:23,898
I just stopped by
to wish you luck.

308
00:15:26,382 --> 00:15:27,611
And...

309
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:30,555
to tell you that Chief O'Brien

310
00:15:30,591 --> 00:15:33,654
will be accompanying you
on your mission.

311
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,802
I don't think
that's a good idea.

312
00:15:37,838 --> 00:15:40,401
Having a Federation officer
along

313
00:15:40,444 --> 00:15:42,346
could cause complications
for you later.

314
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,247
I'm willing to risk that.

315
00:15:44,284 --> 00:15:46,413
You're an excellent
pilot, Major

316
00:15:46,489 --> 00:15:48,925
but Mr. O'Brien here
is better.

317
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,657
And I want to make sure

318
00:15:50,697 --> 00:15:54,899
that I get my runabout
back in one piece.

319
00:15:54,939 --> 00:15:58,777
I appreciate the offer,
but this is a Bajoran problem.

320
00:15:58,814 --> 00:16:00,681
I don't agree.

321
00:16:00,717 --> 00:16:04,851
The truth is, I need
Li Nalas back on Bajor

322
00:16:04,892 --> 00:16:06,383
as much as you do.

323
00:16:06,428 --> 00:16:07,760
Besides

324
00:16:07,798 --> 00:16:10,565
I've seen how the Cardassians
treat their prisoners.

325
00:16:10,604 --> 00:16:12,938
No one should have
to suffer like that.

326
00:16:12,975 --> 00:16:15,241
If the Cardassians
get their hands on us

327
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,406
we'll be the ones suffering.

328
00:16:16,516 --> 00:16:19,647
They'll have to catch us first.

329
00:16:25,868 --> 00:16:28,601
I suppose I could
use the company.

330
00:16:33,683 --> 00:16:35,448
You've got the controls, Chief.

331
00:16:35,521 --> 00:16:36,648
Right.

332
00:16:39,929 --> 00:16:41,397
Before we go

333
00:16:41,431 --> 00:16:44,460
there's, uh, one thing we need
to clear up between us.

334
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:45,666
What's that?

335
00:16:45,707 --> 00:16:47,472
This mission can end
only one of two ways...

336
00:16:47,545 --> 00:16:51,006
either we bring back Li Nalas,
or we don't come back at all.

337
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,314
Understood.

338
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:58,154
Then take us out of here,
Mr. O'Brien.

339
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:00,762
Initializing launch sequence.

340
00:17:19,107 --> 00:17:21,908
How much longer
till we reach Cardassia IV?

341
00:17:21,946 --> 00:17:24,747
I estimate another 30 minutes.

342
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:27,723
Hold on.

343
00:17:27,758 --> 00:17:29,625
We're being scanned.

344
00:17:29,662 --> 00:17:31,096
Can you get a fix on the source?

345
00:17:33,202 --> 00:17:37,506
Its position is holding steady
at bearing 219 mark 23.

346
00:17:37,611 --> 00:17:39,877
It must be
a navigational control post.

347
00:17:39,915 --> 00:17:41,885
It's probably
just a routine scan.

348
00:17:42,921 --> 00:17:44,515
We're being hailed.

349
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:47,188
Then again,
we could be in serious trouble.

350
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,698
They're repeating the hail.

351
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:51,203
We're on the edge
of their scanner range.

352
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:54,142
That puts us out
of visual contact.

353
00:17:54,177 --> 00:17:57,115
I say we try and bluff them.

354
00:17:59,554 --> 00:18:01,183
Opening a channel.

355
00:18:01,224 --> 00:18:05,722
This is Cardassian Navigational
Control Post 24.

356
00:18:05,767 --> 00:18:07,201
Identify yourself.

357
00:18:07,236 --> 00:18:10,208
This is the Lissepian
Transport <i>Martuk.</i>

358
00:18:10,242 --> 00:18:11,710
According to our scan

359
00:18:11,746 --> 00:18:16,119
your subspace field emitters
appear to be malfunctioning.

360
00:18:16,154 --> 00:18:20,117
The field buffers must be
distorting our power signature.

361
00:18:20,162 --> 00:18:24,102
Uh, we're... having problems
with our phase modulators.

362
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:26,539
We're attempting
to correct the problem.

363
00:18:26,642 --> 00:18:28,110
Do you require assistance?

364
00:18:28,145 --> 00:18:31,311
We can dispatch a repair ship.

365
00:18:31,351 --> 00:18:34,255
They want to help us?

366
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:40,098
Your offer is most appreciated,
Post 24, but unnecessary.

367
00:18:40,136 --> 00:18:41,434
Are you certain?

368
00:18:41,471 --> 00:18:44,102
Your power signature
is still fluctuating.

369
00:18:44,144 --> 00:18:46,046
He's getting suspicious.

370
00:18:50,623 --> 00:18:53,595
I believe we can correct
the problem on our own.

371
00:18:53,629 --> 00:18:57,228
Besides, Gul Marayn is waiting

372
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:00,208
on Cardassia IV to receive
my shipment of <i>rulot</i> seeds.

373
00:19:00,242 --> 00:19:02,712
Any delay could ruin
the entire crop

374
00:19:02,748 --> 00:19:05,777
not to mention the Gul's mood.

375
00:19:05,821 --> 00:19:07,289
Understood.

376
00:19:07,323 --> 00:19:10,386
You can put in for repairs
after you deliver your cargo.

377
00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:12,763
My plan, exactly.

378
00:19:17,009 --> 00:19:19,002
He's cut off their transmission.

379
00:19:22,153 --> 00:19:23,713
Tell me, Major...

380
00:19:23,756 --> 00:19:26,192
who is this Gul Marayn?

381
00:19:26,228 --> 00:19:27,822
Don't ask me.

382
00:19:27,865 --> 00:19:29,801
I just made him up.

383
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:40,811
We're in synchronous orbit
above the Hutet labor camp.

384
00:19:42,187 --> 00:19:43,655
I've limited the bio-scans

385
00:19:43,691 --> 00:19:46,184
to detect
only Bajoran life-forms.

386
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:50,694
Hold on.

387
00:19:50,738 --> 00:19:53,335
We're getting multiple readings.

388
00:19:53,376 --> 00:19:55,869
There must be about a dozen
Bajoran prisoners down there.

389
00:19:55,915 --> 00:19:57,144
What?!

390
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:02,787
Is there any way of beaming up
more than two at a time?

391
00:20:02,829 --> 00:20:04,492
I'm afraid not.

392
00:20:04,532 --> 00:20:06,092
As soon as we beam
the first two up

393
00:20:06,135 --> 00:20:08,298
all hell is going
to break loose in that camp.

394
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,106
There's no way of guaranteeing

395
00:20:11,145 --> 00:20:13,274
that Li will be
one of the first two.

396
00:20:13,316 --> 00:20:15,650
What's security like down there?

397
00:20:15,687 --> 00:20:17,155
The compound is surrounded

398
00:20:17,191 --> 00:20:19,423
by a standard
Cardassian force field.

399
00:20:21,165 --> 00:20:22,463
We're going to have to land.

400
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:25,064
It's our only chance of getting
them all out of there.

401
00:20:25,106 --> 00:20:27,737
I'll find us a secluded
place to put down.

402
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,425
Back to work!

403
00:20:57,304 --> 00:20:59,240
Do as I say!

404
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,988
How do I look?

405
00:21:07,024 --> 00:21:08,994
I doubt there's
a Cardassian alive

406
00:21:09,028 --> 00:21:10,496
who could resist you.

407
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:11,998
I hope you're right.

408
00:21:12,034 --> 00:21:13,697
So do I.

409
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,600
Stop talking!

410
00:21:19,615 --> 00:21:20,583
Halt!

411
00:21:20,684 --> 00:21:22,916
We want to see the Prefect.

412
00:21:22,956 --> 00:21:24,424
What for?

413
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:28,091
She has an appointment with him.

414
00:21:28,132 --> 00:21:31,765
I used to be stationed on Bajor.

415
00:21:31,807 --> 00:21:33,538
Then you know why the Prefect

416
00:21:33,576 --> 00:21:35,876
doesn't want
to be kept waiting, huh?

417
00:21:35,915 --> 00:21:38,614
What's this all about?

418
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,781
I'm not quite sure.

419
00:21:40,825 --> 00:21:43,091
What would it cost me
for an appointment?

420
00:21:43,129 --> 00:21:44,758
More than you could afford.

421
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:46,893
Two strips
of gold-pressed latinum...

422
00:21:46,937 --> 00:21:48,566
she's all yours.

423
00:21:48,606 --> 00:21:49,904
He wouldn't know
what to do with me.

424
00:21:49,943 --> 00:21:51,572
She needs disciplining.

425
00:21:51,612 --> 00:21:53,582
From a boy like you? Ha!

426
00:21:53,616 --> 00:21:56,383
I don't think
you're capable of it.

427
00:21:56,422 --> 00:21:57,515
Step back.

428
00:21:57,557 --> 00:22:00,085
I want to examine
what I'm paying for.

429
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,462
Sure, sure

430
00:22:01,499 --> 00:22:06,032
but no sampling the merchandise
until the sale's complete, okay?

431
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:07,566
Come here.

432
00:22:21,338 --> 00:22:22,567
Now...

433
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:24,041
show me why

434
00:22:24,078 --> 00:22:27,950
you're worth two strips
of gold-pressed latinum.

435
00:22:27,985 --> 00:22:30,923
All right.

436
00:22:52,701 --> 00:22:54,101
Li Nalas!

437
00:22:54,138 --> 00:22:55,606
Who are you?

438
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,006
Major Kira Nerys.

439
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,341
We've come to get you
out of here.

440
00:22:58,379 --> 00:23:00,349
The earring... you got it?

441
00:23:00,383 --> 00:23:01,442
Yes.

442
00:23:01,485 --> 00:23:03,045
I don't understand.
My earring was lost.

443
00:23:03,089 --> 00:23:05,491
No, I had it smuggled
back to Bajor.

444
00:23:05,527 --> 00:23:07,827
Gentlemen, I suggest you keep
this discussion for later, okay?

445
00:23:07,864 --> 00:23:09,629
Come on.

446
00:23:14,344 --> 00:23:15,539
Oh!

447
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,761
Come on, we have a ship waiting.

448
00:23:33,349 --> 00:23:35,581
Let's get him
behind those rocks.

449
00:23:40,931 --> 00:23:42,399
I see them!

450
00:23:44,605 --> 00:23:45,937
Keep down.

451
00:23:50,617 --> 00:23:53,110
We'll never make it
at this rate.

452
00:23:55,293 --> 00:23:56,318
Get Li back to Bajor.

453
00:23:56,362 --> 00:23:58,195
Four of us will stay behind
and hold them off

454
00:23:58,232 --> 00:23:59,257
till you reach your ship.

455
00:23:59,301 --> 00:24:00,599
No, I won't allow it.

456
00:24:00,637 --> 00:24:01,605
Don't you see?

457
00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:03,199
We did this for you!

458
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:05,144
Just get him back safely.

459
00:24:05,179 --> 00:24:06,147
That's all that counts.

460
00:24:06,181 --> 00:24:07,479
You have my word.

461
00:24:07,517 --> 00:24:08,712
- All right, go.
- Come on.

462
00:24:08,753 --> 00:24:10,085
- Go!
- Come on.

463
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,834
Come on!

464
00:24:34,938 --> 00:24:37,135
Ready to launch, Major.

465
00:24:37,177 --> 00:24:39,876
Not yet, some of the others
might still make it.

466
00:24:39,915 --> 00:24:41,817
Standing by.

467
00:24:44,057 --> 00:24:47,792
I'm picking up two Galor-class
warships entering orbit.

468
00:24:47,864 --> 00:24:51,668
They should be overhead
in one minute, 45 seconds.

469
00:24:51,705 --> 00:24:55,338
Major, you can't leave
those men behind.

470
00:24:56,382 --> 00:24:59,149
One minute, 30 seconds.

471
00:24:59,187 --> 00:25:02,159
If we don't leave now, Major,
we never will.

472
00:25:04,698 --> 00:25:07,295
Take us home, Chief.

473
00:25:07,337 --> 00:25:09,239
Yes, sir.

474
00:25:23,543 --> 00:25:25,513
Careful, he took a phaser hit.

475
00:25:25,547 --> 00:25:27,210
Easy now, I have you.

476
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:30,245
Doctor, these people have been
prisoners for ten years.

477
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,850
They need medical attention.

478
00:25:31,892 --> 00:25:32,860
They'll get it

479
00:25:32,894 --> 00:25:34,921
but first, I better take
a look at this wound.

480
00:25:34,965 --> 00:25:35,933
Bashir to Dax.

481
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:37,060
Go ahead, Doctor.

482
00:25:37,104 --> 00:25:39,074
We've got a patient
who needs emergency treatment.

483
00:25:39,108 --> 00:25:40,839
Beam us to the Infirmary.

484
00:25:40,877 --> 00:25:41,970
Stand by.

485
00:25:46,989 --> 00:25:48,856
Commander, I need to talk...

486
00:25:48,893 --> 00:25:51,090
Ah, Major, I'm glad
you could join us.

487
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:54,799
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were busy.

488
00:25:54,838 --> 00:25:56,398
Apparently not.

489
00:25:56,442 --> 00:25:57,910
I'll just wait outside.

490
00:25:57,944 --> 00:25:59,105
Hold on, Major.

491
00:25:59,148 --> 00:26:01,676
There's something
I want you to hear.

492
00:26:01,719 --> 00:26:03,245
Go ahead, Dukat.

493
00:26:03,322 --> 00:26:07,626
Major, I have just informed
Commander Sisko

494
00:26:07,664 --> 00:26:13,164
that the Cardassian High Command
has issued a formal apology

495
00:26:13,209 --> 00:26:15,270
to the people of Bajor.

496
00:26:15,313 --> 00:26:16,406
An apology?

497
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:19,387
We had no idea
that Bajoran prisoners

498
00:26:19,421 --> 00:26:22,986
were still being held
on Cardassia IV.

499
00:26:23,028 --> 00:26:26,296
Such detentions
are a direct violation

500
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:30,799
of Supreme Directive 2645

501
00:26:30,844 --> 00:26:32,837
and I assure you

502
00:26:32,881 --> 00:26:36,821
the camp Prefect
will be chastised accordingly.

503
00:26:36,856 --> 00:26:39,851
What about the prisoners
that were left behind?

504
00:26:39,895 --> 00:26:43,334
They are already en route
to Bajor.

505
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:48,743
Well, I look forward
to their safe return.

506
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:50,179
I'm sure you do.

507
00:26:50,216 --> 00:26:53,986
And I hope
that our quick response

508
00:26:54,023 --> 00:26:59,295
to this unfortunate situation
will prove once and for all

509
00:26:59,334 --> 00:27:02,534
that Cardassia
is no longer your enemy.

510
00:27:05,213 --> 00:27:06,272
Commander?

511
00:27:06,315 --> 00:27:08,342
I'm as surprised as you are.

512
00:27:10,623 --> 00:27:12,057
There's got to be a reason

513
00:27:12,092 --> 00:27:13,994
why they're being
so accommodating.

514
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,055
I'm sure there is

515
00:27:15,098 --> 00:27:17,661
but until we can figure out
their motives

516
00:27:17,704 --> 00:27:18,831
let us just be grateful

517
00:27:18,873 --> 00:27:21,309
that all the prisoners
are being returned safely.

518
00:27:21,345 --> 00:27:25,012
Congratulations on the success
of your mission, Major.

519
00:27:31,932 --> 00:27:34,129
There, that should do it.

520
00:27:34,171 --> 00:27:36,073
How do you feel?

521
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,677
Better.

522
00:27:41,719 --> 00:27:42,982
Good.

523
00:27:43,021 --> 00:27:45,184
Luckily, your wound
wasn't as serious

524
00:27:45,226 --> 00:27:46,524
as it looked.

525
00:27:46,562 --> 00:27:48,589
You've probably had a lot worse.

526
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:51,605
Well, actually,
this one was bad enough.

527
00:27:51,639 --> 00:27:54,577
You know, I've read
all about your battle

528
00:27:54,611 --> 00:27:55,601
with Gul Zarale.

529
00:27:55,647 --> 00:27:57,708
That was a long time ago.

530
00:27:57,751 --> 00:27:59,812
Well, I consider myself
a bit of a history buff

531
00:27:59,855 --> 00:28:01,415
and I must say
some of the campaigns

532
00:28:01,458 --> 00:28:03,928
you led against the Cardassians
were truly remarkable...

533
00:28:03,963 --> 00:28:07,163
Doctor, I think that you'll find

534
00:28:07,203 --> 00:28:10,232
that others enjoy talking
about those days

535
00:28:10,276 --> 00:28:11,710
far more than I do.

536
00:28:11,745 --> 00:28:14,181
Of course.

537
00:28:14,217 --> 00:28:15,948
I understand completely.

538
00:28:20,963 --> 00:28:22,090
Amazing.

539
00:28:22,132 --> 00:28:23,498
What is?

540
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:25,369
Being here.

541
00:28:25,406 --> 00:28:26,374
I used to work

542
00:28:26,408 --> 00:28:29,346
in one of this station's
ore processing plants.

543
00:28:29,381 --> 00:28:30,406
I think you will find

544
00:28:30,516 --> 00:28:32,543
that things have changed
considerably.

545
00:28:32,587 --> 00:28:35,423
Commander, a transport
carrying Minister Jaro

546
00:28:35,493 --> 00:28:37,019
has just arrived from Bajor.

547
00:28:37,062 --> 00:28:38,087
Major

548
00:28:38,131 --> 00:28:40,226
I think you should
have the honor

549
00:28:40,269 --> 00:28:41,795
of welcoming him aboard.

550
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:42,829
Thank you, Commander.

551
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,411
If you're hungry

552
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:50,581
the Replimat has some
passable Bajoran food.

553
00:28:52,494 --> 00:28:54,020
Actually, I'm a bit tired.

554
00:28:54,063 --> 00:28:56,033
I think I'd like
to see my quarters.

555
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,035
Of course.

556
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,230
That's Li Nalas.

557
00:29:02,112 --> 00:29:04,675
It appears you've
been recognized.

558
00:29:11,164 --> 00:29:12,132
Minister Jaro.

559
00:29:12,166 --> 00:29:13,795
Major.

560
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:15,134
Where is he?

561
00:29:15,172 --> 00:29:16,801
He's on the Promenade
with Commander Sisko.

562
00:29:16,842 --> 00:29:17,810
And he's all right?

563
00:29:17,844 --> 00:29:19,438
Considering
what he's been through

564
00:29:19,514 --> 00:29:20,607
in the past ten years.

565
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:24,818
Li Nalas alive...
who would have ever imagined?

566
00:29:24,858 --> 00:29:27,260
The Prophets were kind
to you today, Major.

567
00:29:27,297 --> 00:29:29,597
I'd, uh, say they were
kind to all of us.

568
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:31,399
You know, your little adventure

569
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:33,840
made you some enemies
in the Chamber of Ministers.

570
00:29:33,876 --> 00:29:34,844
I'm not surprised.

571
00:29:34,878 --> 00:29:36,176
All I did was risk my life.

572
00:29:36,214 --> 00:29:40,314
What you did today, Major
was declare war on Cardassia.

573
00:29:40,356 --> 00:29:42,223
Thankfully, they declined
the invitation.

574
00:29:42,259 --> 00:29:44,856
I'd do it again if it meant
bringing Li Nalas home.

575
00:29:44,898 --> 00:29:45,923
Yes, I'm sure you would.

576
00:29:45,967 --> 00:29:48,062
Although, officially,
I have to warn you

577
00:29:48,104 --> 00:29:50,438
that the next time
you disobey orders

578
00:29:50,476 --> 00:29:53,141
will mean the end
of your military career.

579
00:29:53,181 --> 00:29:55,310
As a private citizen...

580
00:29:55,353 --> 00:29:57,846
I want to thank you
for what you've done this day.

581
00:30:00,262 --> 00:30:01,993
That's good to hear.

582
00:30:02,032 --> 00:30:03,763
Now take me to see Li Nalas.

583
00:30:08,512 --> 00:30:10,003
Move it back, please.

584
00:30:10,048 --> 00:30:12,143
No pushing, no pushing.

585
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:14,519
I'm sorry about this, Commander.

586
00:30:14,557 --> 00:30:17,188
I don't think they're
going to leave

587
00:30:17,229 --> 00:30:19,199
until you say a few words.

588
00:30:19,233 --> 00:30:20,360
I agree.

589
00:30:26,013 --> 00:30:28,381
If that's what it takes.

590
00:30:34,096 --> 00:30:36,532
It's good to be free.

591
00:30:39,574 --> 00:30:42,512
It's good to know that...

592
00:30:42,547 --> 00:30:45,040
after all our years
of struggle...

593
00:30:46,455 --> 00:30:48,789
...Bajor is finally free.

594
00:30:49,894 --> 00:30:51,557
Yes, it is good to be free.

595
00:30:52,567 --> 00:30:53,728
Well...

596
00:30:54,971 --> 00:30:56,873
it really is you, isn't it?

597
00:30:56,908 --> 00:30:58,035
Li Nalas.

598
00:30:58,077 --> 00:31:00,309
I'm Minister Jaro Essa

599
00:31:00,348 --> 00:31:01,338
and I can't tell you

600
00:31:01,385 --> 00:31:03,378
how delighted I am
to welcome you home.

601
00:31:03,422 --> 00:31:05,415
Believe me, it is
a pleasure to be here.

602
00:31:05,459 --> 00:31:07,929
Would you mind if I
address the crowd?

603
00:31:07,964 --> 00:31:09,432
You can't expect a politician

604
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:11,334
to give up an opportunity
like this.

605
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:13,398
You go right ahead.

606
00:31:13,442 --> 00:31:14,774
Thank you.

607
00:31:16,548 --> 00:31:20,181
Fellow Bajorans, I have
only one thing to say to you...

608
00:31:20,221 --> 00:31:21,712
to ask you, really.

609
00:31:21,758 --> 00:31:24,594
Never forget this moment

610
00:31:24,631 --> 00:31:25,963
because I promise you

611
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,234
that one day, your children
and your grandchildren

612
00:31:29,273 --> 00:31:31,175
will ask you what it was like

613
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:33,510
the day Li Nalas
returned to Bajor.

614
00:31:44,809 --> 00:31:47,406
I hope you'll find
these quarters satisfactory.

615
00:31:51,088 --> 00:31:52,283
Commander...

616
00:31:53,527 --> 00:31:58,595
I just spent ten years
in a Cardassian labor camp.

617
00:32:00,239 --> 00:32:02,368
I'm just grateful...

618
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:04,243
for a moment's privacy.

619
00:32:05,249 --> 00:32:07,549
Enjoy it while you can.

620
00:32:07,588 --> 00:32:10,024
Judging from the crowd
on the Promenade

621
00:32:10,059 --> 00:32:11,892
a moment may be all you get.

622
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:18,834
I thought they would have
forgotten me by now.

623
00:32:18,877 --> 00:32:20,847
It appears you were wrong.

624
00:32:21,983 --> 00:32:23,680
This morning, I was a slave.

625
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:29,296
Tonight, I am a hero.

626
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,596
It must seem
a little overwhelming.

627
00:32:31,636 --> 00:32:34,699
I tell you what is
overwhelming, Commander.

628
00:32:34,742 --> 00:32:40,948
It's knowing that something
I have waited for my whole life

629
00:32:40,988 --> 00:32:44,085
has finally happened.

630
00:32:44,127 --> 00:32:46,120
The Cardassians are gone.

631
00:32:46,165 --> 00:32:47,360
We won.

632
00:32:51,943 --> 00:32:53,172
You've been there recently.

633
00:32:54,782 --> 00:32:59,052
What's it like, a free Bajor?

634
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:03,623
I think you'll be pleased,
for the most part.

635
00:33:03,667 --> 00:33:04,828
For the most part?

636
00:33:04,869 --> 00:33:07,773
Bajor lacks strong leadership.

637
00:33:09,444 --> 00:33:11,880
So that's what Major Kira meant.

638
00:33:14,655 --> 00:33:18,891
On the runabout,
she told me that my return

639
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,458
would bring stability to Bajor.

640
00:33:21,503 --> 00:33:22,664
She's right.

641
00:33:22,705 --> 00:33:26,041
Bajor could use your help,
and frankly, so could I.

642
00:33:28,148 --> 00:33:31,484
But before you go off
saving Bajor

643
00:33:31,523 --> 00:33:33,686
I suppose you could use
a good night's sleep.

644
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:41,698
It sounds
like I'm going to need it.

645
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:54,994
One for you...

646
00:33:55,036 --> 00:33:57,472
and six for me.

647
00:33:59,411 --> 00:34:02,008
One for you and...

648
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:03,713
six for me.

649
00:34:04,555 --> 00:34:06,354
One for you...

650
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:08,189
and six for me.

651
00:34:08,228 --> 00:34:10,528
Would you stop
looking so glum?

652
00:34:10,567 --> 00:34:13,937
Payday is supposed
to be a time of... joy.

653
00:34:13,974 --> 00:34:15,807
I know, brother

654
00:34:15,844 --> 00:34:18,611
but, every week,
it's the same thing.

655
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:21,588
Six for you
and only one for me.

656
00:34:21,623 --> 00:34:22,613
It's not fair!

657
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,353
You're right.

658
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,990
I am?

659
00:34:27,033 --> 00:34:29,800
Yes. It's not fair.

660
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:30,829
It's not?

661
00:34:30,874 --> 00:34:32,776
Absolutely not.

662
00:34:36,385 --> 00:34:38,412
One for you...

663
00:34:38,522 --> 00:34:39,990
and...

664
00:34:41,361 --> 00:34:42,829
...seven

665
00:34:42,865 --> 00:34:44,231
for me.

666
00:34:46,505 --> 00:34:48,600
One for you, and...

667
00:34:48,643 --> 00:34:50,306
seven for me.

668
00:34:50,346 --> 00:34:51,872
Is that better?

669
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,081
And where are you going?

670
00:34:56,124 --> 00:35:00,462
To bed, to dream
of an equal share of profits.

671
00:35:00,533 --> 00:35:02,059
Dream on.

672
00:35:05,844 --> 00:35:07,780
One for you...

673
00:35:07,815 --> 00:35:10,651
and seven for me.

674
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:13,684
What is it now?

675
00:35:27,988 --> 00:35:31,017
Quark... Quark!
Hold still.

676
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:33,854
Doctor...

677
00:35:35,336 --> 00:35:36,463
will there be a scar?

678
00:35:36,538 --> 00:35:37,836
I said, hold still.

679
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:39,275
Does that mean yes?

680
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:43,580
No, this dermal regenerator
should repair any damaged tissue

681
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:45,350
as well as prevent scarring.

682
00:35:45,389 --> 00:35:49,329
Unless, of course,
you don't hold still.

683
00:35:49,364 --> 00:35:51,493
Did you recognize
any of your assailants?

684
00:35:51,568 --> 00:35:53,367
They were wearing masks.

685
00:35:53,405 --> 00:35:55,637
Are you sure they didn't
say anything?

686
00:35:55,677 --> 00:35:56,975
Not a word.

687
00:35:57,013 --> 00:35:58,311
They came in,
branded me and left.

688
00:35:58,348 --> 00:36:00,818
The Promenade is usually
deserted at this hour.

689
00:36:00,854 --> 00:36:02,653
No one saw them
enter or leave.

690
00:36:02,691 --> 00:36:04,923
Constable, I want
all security personnel

691
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:05,987
put on full alert.

692
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:07,762
I've already seen to it.

693
00:36:07,801 --> 00:36:09,600
Who was responsible for this?

694
00:36:09,637 --> 00:36:14,477
An extremist group from Bajor
who call themselves the Circle.

695
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,847
Bajorans did this?

696
00:36:16,886 --> 00:36:18,549
I'm afraid so.

697
00:36:19,591 --> 00:36:20,854
But why?

698
00:36:20,894 --> 00:36:25,358
Their goal is to rid Bajor
of all non-Bajorans.

699
00:36:25,402 --> 00:36:27,201
Hasn't the provisional
government

700
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,503
tried to stop them?

701
00:36:28,575 --> 00:36:30,704
Oh, they've tried,
but the truth is

702
00:36:30,747 --> 00:36:33,617
the Circle is more organized
than the government.

703
00:36:33,652 --> 00:36:35,178
Well, the government
better get organized

704
00:36:35,222 --> 00:36:37,522
because I intend to sue them
for financial compensation.

705
00:36:37,593 --> 00:36:38,754
Not now, Quark!

706
00:36:39,932 --> 00:36:41,731
People have grown impatient

707
00:36:41,769 --> 00:36:44,434
with the government's inability
to get things done

708
00:36:44,474 --> 00:36:46,501
so they turn to the Circle.

709
00:36:46,544 --> 00:36:47,773
Constable.

710
00:36:49,985 --> 00:36:53,355
We need someone to speak out
against these reactionaries...

711
00:36:53,392 --> 00:36:55,885
someone the people
will listen to.

712
00:36:57,801 --> 00:36:58,928
There.

713
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:00,438
That should do it.

714
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:09,951
How do I look?

715
00:37:09,992 --> 00:37:13,021
As... handsome as ever.

716
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,410
Really?

717
00:37:19,444 --> 00:37:20,503
Huh.

718
00:37:21,681 --> 00:37:22,793
Huh.

719
00:37:26,634 --> 00:37:29,265
Jake, what are you doing up?

720
00:37:29,306 --> 00:37:31,937
I couldn't sleep.

721
00:37:31,979 --> 00:37:34,279
How was your date?

722
00:37:34,316 --> 00:37:36,981
It was tonight, wasn't it?

723
00:37:37,022 --> 00:37:38,753
It was supposed to be.

724
00:37:38,792 --> 00:37:40,819
She couldn't make it.

725
00:37:40,863 --> 00:37:42,958
It happens.

726
00:37:43,001 --> 00:37:46,634
She said her father
wouldn't let her go out with me.

727
00:37:46,674 --> 00:37:48,040
Why not?

728
00:37:48,077 --> 00:37:51,345
Because I'm not a Bajoran.

729
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:57,459
That's not much of a reason.

730
00:37:59,633 --> 00:38:01,296
Oh, Jake.

731
00:38:03,641 --> 00:38:07,775
There are some things
happening on Bajor.

732
00:38:07,817 --> 00:38:09,980
Troubling things.

733
00:38:12,827 --> 00:38:16,631
I'm sorry you've become
a victim of them.

734
00:38:16,667 --> 00:38:18,967
You don't deserve it.

735
00:38:19,006 --> 00:38:20,839
Nobody does.

736
00:38:30,695 --> 00:38:32,995
Time for bed, okay?

737
00:38:33,034 --> 00:38:35,027
Okay.

738
00:38:36,374 --> 00:38:37,535
Night, Dad.

739
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:44,857
Commander,
there's a call for you

740
00:38:44,891 --> 00:38:48,626
from the Tygarian freighter
docked on Upper Pylon 2.

741
00:38:48,664 --> 00:38:50,691
Put it through.

742
00:38:50,735 --> 00:38:53,798
Commander Sisko,
I am Romah Doek

743
00:38:53,842 --> 00:38:56,005
Executive Officer of the <i>Nanut.</i>

744
00:38:56,047 --> 00:38:59,076
We were preparing to depart
this station for Gamma Quadrant

745
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,021
when we discovered
a Bajoran citizen

746
00:39:01,057 --> 00:39:03,425
trying to stow away on our ship.

747
00:39:03,461 --> 00:39:06,160
I was hoping you would know
what to do with him.

748
00:39:15,218 --> 00:39:16,686
The <i>Nanut</i> isn't scheduled

749
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,487
to return from the Gamma
Quadrant for two years.

750
00:39:19,593 --> 00:39:21,961
Actually, I planned
on staying considerably longer.

751
00:39:21,998 --> 00:39:23,398
I don't follow.

752
00:39:33,421 --> 00:39:36,723
Commander, I'm going
to tell you a story...

753
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,992
and you may even believe it.

754
00:39:39,032 --> 00:39:40,523
I'm listening.

755
00:39:40,602 --> 00:39:42,367
During the occupation

756
00:39:42,405 --> 00:39:45,070
I was a member
of a minor resistance cell.

757
00:39:45,111 --> 00:39:46,409
Name's unimportant.

758
00:39:46,447 --> 00:39:48,747
One day... this was
in the mountains

759
00:39:48,784 --> 00:39:50,913
surrounding
the Sahving Valley...

760
00:39:50,956 --> 00:39:53,426
we were ambushed
by Cardassian troops.

761
00:39:53,461 --> 00:39:56,558
Only three of us
managed to escape.

762
00:39:56,667 --> 00:39:58,261
We hid in the hills
for two days.

763
00:39:58,304 --> 00:40:00,570
Finally, the lack
of food and water

764
00:40:00,675 --> 00:40:02,736
forced us down into the valley.

765
00:40:02,779 --> 00:40:06,947
We made our way to a ridge
overlooking a small lake.

766
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:09,960
As I was the only one
still carrying a phaser

767
00:40:09,994 --> 00:40:12,795
I went on ahead
to scout for the enemy.

768
00:40:12,832 --> 00:40:16,066
Halfway down the embankment,
I slipped...

769
00:40:16,106 --> 00:40:18,599
went sprawling on my back
down to the edge of the lake

770
00:40:18,678 --> 00:40:21,012
just as a huge Cardassian
emerged from the water.

771
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:23,486
He must have
just finished bathing.

772
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:24,614
He stood there...

773
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:25,988
frozen in surprise

774
00:40:26,026 --> 00:40:27,996
dressed only in his underwear

775
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:30,330
shivering in the cold.

776
00:40:30,368 --> 00:40:33,340
I lay there, looking up at him,
too stunned to even move.

777
00:40:33,374 --> 00:40:37,109
And it was only when he reached
for a phaser rifle

778
00:40:37,148 --> 00:40:39,414
that was lying across
his clothes on a nearby rock

779
00:40:39,453 --> 00:40:42,482
that I realized that I was
still holding my own phaser

780
00:40:42,525 --> 00:40:43,823
and I shot him.

781
00:40:43,861 --> 00:40:46,195
His body fell on top of me.

782
00:40:46,233 --> 00:40:49,330
And that's how my companions
found us a moment later.

783
00:40:49,373 --> 00:40:53,507
One of them recognized him
as, uh, Gul Zarale

784
00:40:53,547 --> 00:40:56,678
responsible for the massacre
of half a dozen

785
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,255
Bajoran villages.

786
00:40:58,291 --> 00:41:00,659
Now, I tried to tell
them what had happened

787
00:41:00,695 --> 00:41:03,462
but they had already
convinced themselves

788
00:41:03,501 --> 00:41:07,464
that I had killed Zarale in
some kind of a savage struggle

789
00:41:07,509 --> 00:41:09,138
which is what they insisted

790
00:41:09,179 --> 00:41:11,445
on telling every
Bajoran that we met.

791
00:41:11,483 --> 00:41:14,114
And no matter how hard
I tried to deny it

792
00:41:14,156 --> 00:41:15,921
the story continued to spread

793
00:41:15,958 --> 00:41:18,521
until it seemed
all of Bajor had heard it.

794
00:41:18,564 --> 00:41:21,400
Soon every victory
won by the resistance

795
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,771
was attributed to my leadership.

796
00:41:23,808 --> 00:41:28,010
Stories of my brilliance,
my daring, my courage

797
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:30,520
grew more and more unbelievable

798
00:41:30,555 --> 00:41:33,527
yet the people
insisted on believing them.

799
00:41:33,561 --> 00:41:36,226
My reputation even followed me
into the labor camp

800
00:41:36,266 --> 00:41:40,400
where my mere presence seemed
to inspire my fellow prisoners.

801
00:41:40,441 --> 00:41:42,570
And I had done nothing

802
00:41:42,612 --> 00:41:48,112
but shoot an unarmed Cardassian
in his underwear.

803
00:41:48,157 --> 00:41:51,493
I'll never forget the look
on his face when he died.

804
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:55,732
He was so... embarrassed.

805
00:41:55,838 --> 00:41:58,035
So you see, Commander

806
00:41:58,077 --> 00:42:01,311
I have done
what Bajor needed me to do.

807
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,784
I have allowed myself

808
00:42:02,819 --> 00:42:07,226
to be a slave to my reputation
all of these years.

809
00:42:07,262 --> 00:42:08,560
And now...

810
00:42:08,597 --> 00:42:11,592
it is enough.

811
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:15,475
They still need you.

812
00:42:17,115 --> 00:42:20,576
But I am not the man
that they think I am.

813
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:23,091
Perhaps not.

814
00:42:23,127 --> 00:42:26,099
But Bajor doesn't need a man.

815
00:42:26,133 --> 00:42:27,727
It needs a symbol

816
00:42:27,802 --> 00:42:29,601
and that's what you are.

817
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:32,941
No one's asking you
to lead troops into battle

818
00:42:32,979 --> 00:42:35,279
or to kill
a hundred Cardassians

819
00:42:35,318 --> 00:42:36,809
with your bare hands.

820
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:40,627
I saw you...

821
00:42:40,661 --> 00:42:43,963
in front of the crowd
on the Promenade.

822
00:42:44,001 --> 00:42:45,971
They look at you

823
00:42:46,005 --> 00:42:51,073
and they see strength
and honor and decency.

824
00:42:51,116 --> 00:42:55,113
They look at you and see
the best in themselves.

825
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,260
But it's all based on a lie.

826
00:42:59,299 --> 00:43:02,465
No. It's based on a legend.

827
00:43:03,974 --> 00:43:07,435
And legends are as powerful
as any truth.

828
00:43:07,482 --> 00:43:10,943
Bajor still needs that legend.

829
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:12,651
It needs you.

830
00:43:23,113 --> 00:43:25,310
The Yelikan transport
is ready for departure.

831
00:43:25,351 --> 00:43:29,155
Opening mooring clamps
on Docking Bay Six.

832
00:43:29,192 --> 00:43:30,524
Major.

833
00:43:37,542 --> 00:43:38,510
Commander.

834
00:43:38,544 --> 00:43:39,671
Minister Jaro.

835
00:43:39,713 --> 00:43:40,681
Li.

836
00:43:40,715 --> 00:43:41,808
Navarch Li...

837
00:43:41,917 --> 00:43:44,353
as of yesterday's
unanimous assembly vote.

838
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:45,823
Congratulations.

839
00:43:45,891 --> 00:43:47,018
Navarch...

840
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:48,528
there's never been one before.

841
00:43:48,564 --> 00:43:51,195
They felt any existing title
was inadequate

842
00:43:51,236 --> 00:43:53,297
so they created
a new one for me.

843
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,139
I hear that thousands
of people showed up

844
00:43:55,177 --> 00:43:57,477
to greet your ship
when it arrived on Bajor.

845
00:43:57,515 --> 00:43:59,485
Yes, it was
quite a celebration.

846
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:01,648
I wish I could
have stayed longer.

847
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:02,988
Why? What stopped you?

848
00:44:03,026 --> 00:44:05,623
The Navarch needed to return
here to assume his new post.

849
00:44:05,665 --> 00:44:09,069
He's been made the Bajoran
Liaison Officer to Deep Space 9.

850
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:11,735
I already have
a liaison officer.

851
00:44:11,777 --> 00:44:13,440
Not anymore, you don't.

852
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:16,179
Major Kira is no longer
assigned to this post.

853
00:44:16,219 --> 00:44:18,212
She's been recalled to Bajor.
