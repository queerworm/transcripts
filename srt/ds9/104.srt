1
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,269
It's Dr. Bashir,
isn't it?

2
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,855
Of course it is.

3
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:23,357
May I introduce myself?

4
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,275
Uh... yes.

5
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,318
Yes, of course.

6
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,111
My name is Garak.

7
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,823
A Cardassian by birth,
obviously.

8
00:00:30,823 --> 00:00:33,575
The only one of us left
on this station,

9
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,202
as a matter of fact.

10
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:38,873
So I do appreciate making
new friends whenever I can.

11
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:42,501
You are new to the
station, I believe.

12
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:44,545
I am, yes.

13
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:48,841
Though...
though I understand

14
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:50,926
you've been here
quite a while.

15
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:53,387
Ah. You know of me then.

16
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,890
Would you care
for some of this Tarkalean tea?

17
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,057
It's very good.

18
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,685
What a thoughtful
young man.

19
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,937
How nice that we've met.

20
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,525
You know...

21
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:09,945
some people say
that you remained on DS9

22
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:13,114
as the eyes and ears
of your fellow Cardassians.

23
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,324
You don't say.

24
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,913
Doctor-- you're
not intimating

25
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:21,456
that I'm some sort
of spy, are you?

26
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:24,251
I wouldn't know, sir.

27
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,670
Ah. An open mind--

28
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,423
the essence of intellect.

29
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:31,050
As you may also know,

30
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,176
I have a clothing
shop nearby,

31
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,679
so if you should
require any apparel

32
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:37,389
or simply wish, as I do,

33
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:40,434
for a bit of enjoyable
company now and then,

34
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:43,604
I'm at your
disposal, Doctor.

35
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:46,189
You're very kind,
Mr. Garak.

36
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:50,360
Oh, it's just Garak--
plain, simple...

37
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,904
BOTH:
Garak.

38
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:55,532
Now, good day
to you, Doctor.

39
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:01,162
I'm so glad
to have made

40
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:05,125
such an interesting
new friend today.

41
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,013
You won't believe
who just sat down

42
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:20,057
next to me
in the Replimat.

43
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,516
Major, Upper Pylon 3

44
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,310
will be shut down for
maintenance for 48 hours.

45
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,479
The<i> spy.</i>

46
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,106
Garak, the Cardassian.

47
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:28,065
We don't know for a fact

48
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,232
Garak's a spy, Doctor.

49
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,652
He is.
You should have heard him.

50
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,153
He-He introduced himself

51
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,739
and, and, and he struck up
conversation just like that.

52
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:36,824
He was making contact
with me.

53
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:38,575
With me, of
all people.

54
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,869
What do you think
he might want from<i> you,</i> Julian?

55
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:43,705
I don't know...

56
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,125
Federation medical secrets.

57
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,002
Rest assured, they're safe
with me, Commander.

58
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:49,544
I'm sure they are,
Dr. Bashir.

59
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,088
In fact, Chief O'Brien,

60
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,548
I think you should place
a monitoring device on me.

61
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,720
Well, just in case...

62
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,680
he...

63
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,556
he's up to something?

64
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,391
I don't think that will be
necessary, Doctor.

65
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:04,935
Just be very cautious when...

66
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,937
Commander, we have a small craft
taking evasive action.

67
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,188
Cardassian war vessel
in pursuit.

68
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:10,398
On screen.

69
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,613
KIRA:
That's Bajoran.

70
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,449
That damned Cardassian's
firing at a Bajoran scout ship

71
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,993
in Bajoran space.

72
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:23,453
Mr. O'Brien?
Confirmed, sir.

73
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,039
They've crossed
into Bajoran space.

74
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,916
Open a hailing frequency
to the Cardassians.

75
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,417
Channel open.

76
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:32,754
Cardassian vessel,
you are violating Bajoran space.

77
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,673
Break off your pursuit.

78
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:37,134
Repeat: break off now.

79
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,636
No reply
from the Cardassians.

80
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,638
Bajoran vessel
is hailing us.

81
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:42,973
Open the channel.

82
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:45,475
<i>Space station, do you read?</i>

83
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,643
<i>Space station...</i>

84
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,436
We can only get audio,
Commander.

85
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,771
This is Benjamin Sisko

86
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,857
Starfleet Commander
of the station.

87
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:53,108
Who are you?

88
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:55,235
Why are they pursuing?

89
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,613
<i>Please! Repeating request</i>
<i>for emergency docking. Please!</i>

90
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:01,992
DAX:
<i>The Bajoran scout ship</i>
<i>is badly damaged.</i>

91
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,869
Structural integrity is failing.

92
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,163
He's breaking up.

93
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:07,581
Get him out, Mr. O'Brien.

94
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,124
Aye, sir.

95
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,758
Medical assistance to Ops.

96
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:22,721
My name is Tahna Los.

97
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:26,016
Request political asylum.

98
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,976
Kira?

99
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,057
KIRA:
His name is Tahna Los.

100
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,184
We fought together
in the underground.

101
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:34,519
Commander, the Cardassians
are hailing us.

102
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,729
<i>Now</i> they want to talk.

103
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,981
They're hopping mad.

104
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,983
Open the channel, Mr. O'Brien.

105
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,818
<i>Federation Commander</i>

106
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,779
<i>you have taken aboard</i>
<i>a known criminal.</i>

107
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,865
<i>You will turn him over to us.</i>

108
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:49,159
He has requested asylum.

109
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,952
<i>You have not granted it?</i>

110
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,579
To be honest,
I haven't decided yet.

111
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,331
<i>He is Kohn-Ma.</i>

112
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:57,376
<i>Not even the Bajorans</i>
<i>would grant his kind asylum.</i>

113
00:06:57,376 --> 00:07:01,755
<i>He has committed heinous crimes</i>
<i>against the Cardassian people,</i>

114
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,131
<i>and I demand</i>

115
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,175
<i>that you release him</i>
<i>to our custody.</i>

116
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,010
I'll investigate the matter
immediately.

117
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,221
In the interim, if you care
to dock your vessel

118
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:10,764
I'll be glad
to hear an explanation

119
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,182
for having violated
Bajoran space

120
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,809
and threatened
a Federation facility.

121
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:18,063
<i>We have made no threat</i>
<i>to your facility.</i>

122
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,065
I stand corrected.

123
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,775
Sisko out.

124
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:27,322
The Major and I will
be at the Infirmary.

125
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,783
I'd like some time to talk
with this fellow Tahna.

126
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,826
When Gul Danar comes in

127
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,912
it would be nice if we had
a few docking regulations

128
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,914
to keep him
outside a while.

129
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:37,457
Understood.

130
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,925
You're not seriously
considering

131
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:50,053
handing Tahna over
to the Cardassians?

132
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,347
Were you part of
this<i> Kohn-Ma,</i> Major?

133
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,724
If I had been,
I would not be working

134
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,810
with the provisional
government now.

135
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,312
No, you'd still
be out there

136
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:00,188
murdering Cardassians,
or even some Bajoran

137
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,648
that the<i> Kohn-Ma</i>
hold in contempt.

138
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:02,899
Didn't they claim
responsibility

139
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,318
for the assassination

140
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:05,902
of one of your First
Ministers last month?

141
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,073
Look, I know Tahna.

142
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,866
Is he<i> Kohn-Ma?</i>

143
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,660
Yes, but...

144
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,037
I suggest you get your
priorities straight, Major

145
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,206
because I don't have any
room for divided loyalties

146
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,666
in this command,

147
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,668
and I won't have
a<i> Kohn-Ma</i> terrorist

148
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,753
using this station
as a protective shield

149
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,380
for continuing violence.

150
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,257
My priorities are straight,
Commander.

151
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,134
Let's not be confused here.

152
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,677
My loyalties are to Bajor,

153
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,054
and Bajor needs men
like Tahna Los.

154
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,723
Apparently, his war with the
Cardassians isn't over yet.

155
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,476
If Bajor is ever to rebuild

156
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:39,144
a strong and independent
society,

157
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,979
it will require
the repatriation

158
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,440
of splinter groups
like the<i> Kohn-Ma.</i>

159
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,942
You have--<i> we</i> have--
an opportunity here, Commander.

160
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,819
I hope you don't miss it.

161
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,418
How is he?

162
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:06,546
Second-degree
burns, lacerations

163
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,173
a minor concussion.

164
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,008
Not much compared to what
he's been through before.

165
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:12,344
Before?

166
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:14,471
The most recent
of these scars

167
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:17,349
is only two, perhaps
three years old.

168
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:19,851
Two and a half, actually.

169
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:22,229
It's remarkable you
lived through this.

170
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:25,190
It's a Cardassian technique
designed to keep you alive.

171
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,071
I'm Commander
Benjamin Sisko.

172
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,280
I have a few questions
for you

173
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,698
if you're up
to answering them.

174
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,575
Commander Sisko hasn't decided

175
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,618
whether or not to grant you
asylum yet, Tahna.

176
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:41,039
Major, perhaps I should
conduct this alone.

177
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,417
Major?

178
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:47,462
I'm the liaison officer
to the Federation here...

179
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,630
Still fighting for Bajor

180
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,383
in my own way.

181
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,470
I'll stop by later.

182
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:06,689
What do you need
to know, Commander?

183
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,900
For starters,
why were they chasing you?

184
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,320
You really want to hear
the story of my life?

185
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,614
I assume, as a member
of the<i> Kohn-Ma</i>

186
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,616
you've committed serious acts
against them.

187
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,410
Any one of a hundred

188
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,329
that would lead
to a Cardassian death sentence.

189
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,748
Any of them since
their withdrawal from Bajor?

190
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,294
Frankly, yes.

191
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,003
Why would you
continue the violence

192
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,088
against them now?

193
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:36,636
To be honest,
I'm not sure anymore.

194
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:40,640
We say we're punishing them
for crimes committed against us

195
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,184
for over
half a century

196
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:46,396
but I've had enough
of the killing.

197
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:49,941
I'm sorry, Commander.

198
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,109
He needs rest now.

199
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,947
Admiral, I think
Commander Sisko

200
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,698
is being incredibly
short-sighted.

201
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:00,285
He obviously
doesn't understand
the issues involved.

202
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,745
<i>Thank you for bringing this</i>
<i>to my attention, Major.</i>

203
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:03,955
<i>I'll stay in close touch</i>

204
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,123
<i>with the situation.</i>

205
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,500
Thank you, Admiral.

206
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,094
Sir, the Cardassian warship
has docked.

207
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,720
Lieutenant Dax
is making sure

208
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,307
that all procedural details
are precisely observed

209
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:24,351
no matter how long it takes.

210
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:25,977
Well done.

211
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:27,354
I have some more research

212
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,980
to do on the<i> Kohn-Ma</i>
before I see them.

213
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,732
Sir, I don't know much

214
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,401
about the Bajoran
terrorists,

215
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,862
but you've never fought
the Cardassians, have you?

216
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,405
No.

217
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:40,867
Well, you wouldn't want
to turn a man-- any man--

218
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,453
over to their
tender care, sir.

219
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:46,164
You just wouldn't.

220
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,499
Subspace transmission

221
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:50,043
from Admiral Rollman
for you, Commander.

222
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,586
In my office.

223
00:11:58,176 --> 00:11:59,844
<i>Ben, that Bajoran woman</i>

224
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:03,973
<i>you have working for you</i>
<i>interrupted a staff meeting</i>

225
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,724
<i>to tell me how she disapproves</i>

226
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:08,102
<i>of your handling</i>
<i>of this asylum matter.</i>

227
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,313
<i>I think you have</i>
<i>a problem there, Commander.</i>

228
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,399
Yes, Admiral.

229
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:16,903
It's all right.

230
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,321
You're safe.

231
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:25,161
Strange to run
into each other here, isn't it?

232
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,913
It's good to be with someone

233
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,207
who knows what
it's been like out there.

234
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:32,751
Wearing that uniform,
I thought maybe you'd forgotten.

235
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:34,795
Never.

236
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:35,922
No?

237
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,007
Working on the
inside hasn't dulled

238
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,842
that old fire
just a little?

239
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,969
Uh... ask Sisko about that.

240
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,137
Don't get along?

241
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,265
Oil and water.

242
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,100
(<i> chuckling</i> )

243
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,436
You're tired.
I should go.

244
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,730
Kira?

245
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,608
Do you think he'll give me
to the Cardassians?

246
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:57,193
Over my dead body.

247
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,654
Now, that's the Kira I remember.

248
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,795
If you require all vessels

249
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:19,633
to endure such lengthy
docking procedures, Commander,

250
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:20,799
you're going to have

251
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,009
a lot of impatient
traffic out there.

252
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,428
I apologize.

253
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,221
We're still trying
to repair all the damage

254
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,889
your forces did
before they left.

255
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,684
It does create
unreasonable delays.

256
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:33,772
I accept your apology,
but not your explanation.

257
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:35,856
What about Tahna Los?

258
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,318
Well, we've got a problem.

259
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:41,904
A diplomatic insult
to the Cardassian people

260
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,698
would be a problem.

261
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:47,118
Delivering a wanted criminal
to us would not be.

262
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,369
Danar

263
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,414
in war, both sides
commit atrocities.

264
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:54,083
I can only tell you
that we are certain

265
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,252
he plans to commit
more acts of terrorism.

266
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,213
He tells me that he has
renounced the<i> Kohn-Ma</i>

267
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,508
and wants to help
to rebuild Bajor.

268
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:05,886
He has committed brutal acts
of destruction and murder,

269
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,765
and he must pay
for those crimes.

270
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:12,185
I appreciate the
Cardassian position

271
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,854
but I know if a Bajoran
freedom fighter

272
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:18,608
is turned over
to the Cardassians

273
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,026
by the Federation,

274
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,987
that would be a mistake
that would undermine

275
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,656
everything that I'm
trying to accomplish here.

276
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:27,325
So, with apologies,

277
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:30,411
I'm going to grant him
asylum for the time being.

278
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,623
Eventually, he'll want
to relocate to Bajor.

279
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,417
and if you want
to pursue the matter

280
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,713
with the provisional government,
then that's your business.

281
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,219
(<i> door closes</i> )

282
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,480
How long since
you've slept in
a comfortable bed?

283
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:02,026
I can adapt to that part
very quickly, thank you.

284
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,444
I'm glad you're here.

285
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,739
We need you, Tahna.

286
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:09,075
I don't think the Federation
has any use

287
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,578
for my particular talents.

288
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,079
I mean,
Bajor needs you.

289
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:18,334
If you had the impression
that I'm a Federation officer

290
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,836
in any way,
I promise you, I...

291
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,003
I thought you were
under Sisko's command.

292
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,171
I am, but...

293
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,214
Now, you see,
that's something

294
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:26,008
I could never adapt to.

295
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,927
Someone has to
coordinate relations

296
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,847
between the Federation
and the provisional government.

297
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,849
At least, with
someone like me here...

298
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,100
Why?

299
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,102
Why should they
be here at all?

300
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:39,355
What right does this
so-called provisional
government have

301
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:42,525
to bring them here after
all we fought for, Kira?

302
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,360
Freedom from domination.

303
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,070
True independence.

304
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,280
No outsiders.

305
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,908
No Cardassians
and no Federation.

306
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:53,286
Things have changed, Tahna.

307
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,830
With the discovery
of the wormhole...

308
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,458
Oh, yes, the wormhole.

309
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,251
Look, I don't want
the Federation here

310
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:01,878
any more than you do

311
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,255
but they are serving a purpose,
for the time being at least.

312
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:05,882
Without the Federation

313
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,718
the Cardassians would
be back in a minute

314
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,344
to take control
of the wormhole,

315
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,306
and the wormhole is
the future of Bajor, Tahna.

316
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,099
It's bringing ships
and commerce.

317
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,518
It's making us
a power in the quadrant.

318
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,687
I don't want to be a power
in the quadrant.

319
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,439
I want Bajor for Bajorans.

320
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:23,065
I want our
homeland back.

321
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,692
We have it back.

322
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,861
And, as we grow stronger

323
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,488
we'll be able to
defend it ourselves

324
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,739
without having to lean
on the Federation

325
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:31,449
or anyone else.

326
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:34,744
I know it's difficult to see
after all we've been through.

327
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:36,203
We want it all now.

328
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,832
But with people like you
leading the way...

329
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,792
You have adapted

330
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,543
haven't you?

331
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:46,965
Tahna, I have put myself
on the line for you here.

332
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:49,717
You are finished
with the<i> Kohn-Ma?</i>

333
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,470
Yes.

334
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,388
Yes, I am finished
with the<i> Kohn-Ma.</i>

335
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,894
I've been talking with
several of the ministers

336
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:02,689
of the provisional government
about amnesty

337
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,984
for you and any member of
the<i> Kohn-Ma</i> who follows you.

338
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:08,569
Well, there are some
who might...

339
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,029
if there were assurances.

340
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,072
I'm working on it, Tahna.

341
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:15,201
I'll find a way
to make it happen.

342
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,798
What?

343
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,591
Sir, we've had
a little problem.

344
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,677
These two women

345
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:35,095
are just arriving.

346
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,223
They objected to
giving up their weapons.

347
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:40,601
Klingons do not
surrender their weapons.

348
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,020
ODO:
Who are you?

349
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,439
We are Lursa and B'Etor
of the house of Duras.

350
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,107
And we have
specific regulations.

351
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:50,152
You can leave the weapons
or leave the station.

352
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,030
Your choice.

353
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,072
Please
make it now.

354
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,699
Who are you?

355
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:58,202
I'm the one
giving you the choice.

356
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,464
Welcome to DS9.

357
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:20,224
We have some new guests
you might be interested in.

358
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,517
A couple of Klingon sisters

359
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,477
from the Duras family.

360
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,730
Lursa and B'Etor.

361
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,398
You know them then?

362
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:30,818
They tried to grab control
of the Klingon High Council.

363
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,486
Started a brief civil war.

364
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,864
They've been out
of sight since then.

365
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:36,657
I ran a security check.

366
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:39,410
The Klingons have them
listed as renegades.

367
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,913
We've heard they've been
trying to raise capital

368
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:43,372
to rebuild their armies.

369
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,416
What are they doing here?

370
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,043
Sitting.

371
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:50,421
They went straight to Quark's,
but not for the gambling

372
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:53,091
and certainly not for the food.

373
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:54,383
They're just sitting.

374
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,302
I don't like it.

375
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:00,098
Why don't I...
lock them up

376
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:03,434
and call the Klingons
to come get them?

377
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:05,061
Odo.

378
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:07,605
If they're enemies
of the Klingon High Council...

379
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:10,149
They haven't broken
any laws here.

380
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:14,070
You can't just
throw them in jail.

381
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,322
You know, Cardassian rule
may have been oppressive

382
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,866
but at least
it was simple.

383
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,910
Keep an eye on them.

384
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,288
As you wish, Commander.

385
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,499
(<i> conversation and laughter</i> )

386
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,320
And how are you this evening,
Mr. Garak?

387
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,031
Excuse me.

388
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:00,366
Just plain, simple Garak,
you said.

389
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,242
Plain and simple.

390
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,120
Join me, Doctor.

391
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,955
Enhance my evening.

392
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:10,084
Keeping an eye on the ebb
and flow of things, are you?

393
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,127
As a clothier

394
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,004
I do have a keen interest

395
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:14,881
on what the population
is wearing

396
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,132
from day to day.

397
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:19,093
Klingons have an odd
sense of style.

398
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,970
Don't you agree?

399
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,555
Oh, yes, they do.

400
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:23,681
But intriguing.

401
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:25,224
I would say

402
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:31,355
that those two outfits
are worth studying closely.

403
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:39,155
Look.

404
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,438
LURSA:
All right,
where's the payment?

405
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:14,190
TAHNA:
It's on its way.

406
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,900
That was not
the arrangement.

407
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,111
I couldn't stop to get it.

408
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:20,238
I barely got past
the Cardassians.

409
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:21,864
Your safety
is not our concern.

410
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,449
Your gold is.

411
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,409
It will be available tomorrow.

412
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,120
Good.

413
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,330
Because if we have made
this trip for nothing

414
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,292
you will have made
a fatal mistake.

415
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,487
I managed to
arrange a hearing

416
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,030
of the Ministers' Court.

417
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,198
Any predictions?

418
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:05,699
Well, I have two
of the ministers--

419
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,618
the smart ones-- ready
to vote for amnesty.

420
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:09,411
I'm sure one of the others
will fall in line.

421
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,830
Good.

422
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,999
And Tahna says two
more of the<i> Kohn-Ma</i>

423
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,374
are willing
to follow him

424
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:16,585
<i>if</i> you'll guarantee
their safety.

425
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,212
Done.

426
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:22,133
I have to say this, Commander.

427
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:23,217
When we first talked

428
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:25,761
I wasn't sure you...

429
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:29,098
This wouldn't have been possible
without your support.

430
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:31,809
I want you to know
it's appreciated.

431
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:33,227
Be sure to mention it

432
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:35,104
the next time you chat
with Admiral Rollman.

433
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,065
Sir?

434
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,234
Go over<i> my</i> head again

435
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:42,611
and I'll have yours
on a platter.

436
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:55,457
So, Constable, news
about our Klingon sisters?

437
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,710
They seem to make
friends easily.

438
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,003
Friends?

439
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:01,630
Our reformed<i> Kohn-Ma,</i>
for example.

440
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,300
Tahna, with Lursa
and B'Etor?

441
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,843
Talking about
a business arrangement.

442
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:07,511
He's paying them
for something.

443
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:08,804
I don't know what.

444
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,890
The gold is
supposedly on its way.

445
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,726
Two other members of the<i> Kohn-Ma</i>
may be bringing it.

446
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,811
How do you know that?

447
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,652
Major Kira mentioned
that they were on their way.

448
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:26,613
ODO:
Do you want her
to know about this?

449
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,699
Not quite yet.

450
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,507
You are the clothier Garak?

451
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,801
At your service, madam.

452
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:51,805
May I show you some
of our latest fashions?

453
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:54,516
Perhaps some silk lingerie

454
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,352
from Kraus IV?

455
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,938
Watch your tongue,
Cardassian, or I'll

456
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,314
rip it out and eat it!

457
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:02,608
(<i> snarling</i> )

458
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:05,443
I meant no offense.

459
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:08,906
I have few Klingon patrons.

460
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:12,701
So, is there something
you wish to buy?

461
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,662
We're not here to buy.

462
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:18,082
We are here to sell.

463
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:19,625
We understand

464
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:23,337
you still represent
Cardassian interests here.

465
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:26,924
Ah, I am only a simple
clothing merchant.

466
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:29,718
We have no time
for your games!

467
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,637
Do you want Tahna Los
or not?!

468
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:34,265
Are you in a position
to deliver the Bajoran

469
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:35,682
to Cardassian
authorities?

470
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:37,059
What is he worth to them?

471
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:39,895
In gold-pressed latinum?

472
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:50,614
(<i> spits</i> )

473
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:51,824
You insult us!

474
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:54,827
Ladies, ladies, please.

475
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:56,578
Everything is negotiable.

476
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:59,415
I am no more
than what I seem to be--

477
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:02,084
a merchant trying to make
the best transaction.

478
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:06,839
So... let us haggle.

479
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:10,926
(<i> door chimes</i> )

480
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:12,928
Yes?

481
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,935
I have
the third minister's vote.

482
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,854
The hearing is simply
a formality now.

483
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:24,564
You are going
to receive amnesty, Tahna.

484
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:27,525
I never realized you were such
an accomplished politician.

485
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:30,446
Me? A politician?

486
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:32,406
No, I don't think so.

487
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:35,326
You manipulate Sisko
and the Federation

488
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:36,994
the ministers
of the provisional government...

489
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:38,787
I'm just determined.

490
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:42,540
I think they all simply
get tired of hearing my voice.

491
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,169
(<i> laughs</i> )

492
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:47,838
And here we expected to find

493
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:51,800
that Kira Nerys had lost
the fire in her heart.

494
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,635
What are you talking about?

495
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:59,099
You knew I was here
before you even came.

496
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:04,397
Tahna, I trusted you.

497
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:06,065
I am<i> Kohn-Ma.</i>

498
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:08,067
I fight for the freedom
of Bajor.

499
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,027
You once fought
for it, as well.

500
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:11,737
I'm still fighting for it.

501
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,280
Stop deluding yourself!

502
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,616
You say you don't believe
in the Federation.

503
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,494
You say you don't believe
in the provisional government

504
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:19,703
and yet you are
their dance instructor.

505
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,330
That's not fair.

506
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,956
Don't be naive, Major!

507
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:25,543
I don't want the Federation
here, but, for now...

508
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:28,295
Once you're in your comfortable
bed with the Federation

509
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,547
you won't be able to get out.

510
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:30,756
<i>We</i> won't be able to get out.

511
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:32,425
If you expect me to commit

512
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:34,676
some act of violence
against the Federation...

513
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,762
No... no, the violence is over.

514
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,305
That is the truth.

515
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,433
No one will get hurt in any way.

516
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:41,767
I promise you that.

517
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,561
But I do need your help.

518
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:45,687
You already lied
to me, Tahna.

519
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,273
I know how
the game works.

520
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:48,566
To do what we plan

521
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:50,817
we need a small ship
capable of warp speed.

522
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:53,487
I gambled that
I could convince you

523
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:54,780
to get it for us.

524
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,450
And just what is
this peaceful plan?

525
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,743
In one move,
and nonviolently

526
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:03,581
we accomplish everything
both of us has ever wanted

527
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:04,582
for Bajor.

528
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:05,623
How?

529
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,669
I know the game, too, Kira.

530
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:13,048
You know I cannot risk
telling you that.

531
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:16,802
How do you know I won't
just go straight to Sisko?

532
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:20,722
Well, if you do,
then we'll both know

533
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,015
where your loyalties are

534
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,976
won't we?

535
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:34,069
Ah, plain,
simple Garak.

536
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,904
How are
you today?

537
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,407
Being observant, Doctor.

538
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:39,783
I'm sure of it.

539
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:42,578
There's a time for levity,
my young friend

540
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:45,663
and a time
for genuine concern.

541
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:48,584
The arrival on this station,
for instance

542
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,877
of those two<i> Kohn-Ma</i>
terrorists.

543
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:53,589
Terrorists?

544
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:55,466
What are they doing here?

545
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:59,219
I'm not exactly sure,
but, together

546
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:02,722
we might have some success
at finding out.

547
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,682
Garak, I'm a doctor, not...

548
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:07,520
And, once you do have
the appropriate answer

549
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,605
I'm sure you'll know

550
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:11,357
what to do with it.

551
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:13,317
I really must
be getting along now.

552
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:15,110
Uh... Doctor...

553
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:19,239
I think it's time for you
to take advantage of my shop.

554
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:22,826
If you'll be there
at exactly 2055 hours tonight

555
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:25,287
I promise to show you a suit

556
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,831
that will make you
into a new man.

557
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,082
A suit?

558
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,543
We're talking
about terrorists

559
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:33,629
and you want me
to buy a new suit.

560
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,631
Doctor, am I making
myself clear?

561
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:40,177
I want you to buy
a new suit tonight at 2055...

562
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:41,512
exactly.

563
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:42,846
Uh, yes.

564
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,264
I see.

565
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,517
Well, if you'll excuse me.

566
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:48,352
Mmm.

567
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,608
A suit.

568
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:55,775
Mmm.

569
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,286
Major.

570
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,705
Commander.

571
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,712
I'd like to meet
the two<i> Kohn-Ma</i>
who just arrived

572
00:29:14,712 --> 00:29:15,962
as soon as possible.

573
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:18,048
Of course.
I'll arrange it.

574
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:20,384
How do they seem to you?

575
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:21,719
Sir?

576
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:24,471
Do you feel
as secure about them

577
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,765
as you do
about Tahna Los?

578
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,392
Absolutely.

579
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:29,643
Commander Sisko.

580
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:36,149
I need some guidance.

581
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,526
Yes, Doctor.

582
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,778
It's about Garak--
the Cardassian.

583
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,614
I'm afraid
this relationship

584
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:44,157
has gotten
a little out of hand.

585
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,158
How's that?

586
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,160
He wants me
to buy a suit.

587
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,370
A suit?

588
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,538
At exactly 2055 tonight.

589
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:50,789
Why 2055?

590
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,249
I don't know,
but it has something to do

591
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:54,668
with those two Bajoran
terrorists on board.

592
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:57,337
He says that,<i> together,</i>
he and I might discover

593
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,756
what they're
really doing here.

594
00:29:58,756 --> 00:30:01,007
I don't understand
why he wants me involved.

595
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:03,343
Sometimes communications
can't be conducted

596
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,637
through official channels.

597
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:07,347
Maybe this is their way
of telling us

598
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:08,682
that we have a common enemy.

599
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:10,267
Well, what do you
want me to do?

600
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:13,771
I think, Doctor, you could
definitely use a new suit.

601
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:23,405
Busy?

602
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:26,617
What can I do for you?

603
00:30:26,617 --> 00:30:30,287
Are, um... are all
the security measures in place

604
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:33,123
for the trip
to the Ministers' Court?

605
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:35,875
I told you they'd be
taken care of and they will.

606
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:44,510
Fine.

607
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:51,767
You know, there's one thing
about you humanoids

608
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:54,436
I can't imitate very well.

609
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:56,188
What's that?

610
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,482
Pretense.

611
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:01,443
There's a special talent to it.

612
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:03,612
It's as hard for me

613
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:06,198
as creating one
of your noses.

614
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:10,494
Maybe that's why I've learned
to respect your opinion

615
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:13,664
Constable--
never any pretense.

616
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:26,760
How much do you know
about me, Odo?

617
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,724
More than you probably realize.

618
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:37,563
I've done some things
I'm not proud of.

619
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:44,653
I still have nightmares about
the raids on the Haru Outpost

620
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:49,282
but at least I was sure
about what I was doing then.

621
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,706
And...

622
00:31:57,541 --> 00:32:01,169
there's something
you're not sure of now.

623
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:04,172
You have no more love
for the Federation than I do.

624
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,340
Meaning?

625
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:09,553
Maybe there<i> are</i> still wars
to be fought

626
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:11,805
and I'm just
making a fool of myself

627
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:13,766
doing what I'm doing here.

628
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:21,398
It sounds like you're trying to
talk yourself into something...

629
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:23,275
or out of something.

630
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:27,153
Either way,
I have to betray someone.

631
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:31,450
The only important thing
is not to betray yourself.

632
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:38,624
How could I possibly turn
against my own people?

633
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:40,500
Are they

634
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,085
your own people?

635
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:44,713
They're no different
than I used to be.

636
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,467
<i>Used</i> to be?

637
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:51,470
I could just refuse
to help them--

638
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,555
ignore the whole thing.

639
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:03,356
The Joranian ostrich hides by
sticking its head underwater--

640
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:06,610
sometimes even until it drowns.

641
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:09,738
And they'd find a way

642
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:12,449
to do whatever
they want to do anyway

643
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:15,828
and I'd still feel responsible
for the consequences.

644
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,251
(<i> sighs</i> )

645
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:27,673
It was so much easier
when I knew who the enemy was.

646
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:30,801
Odo to Sisko.

647
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:33,094
<i>Go ahead.</i>

648
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,805
There's someone down in here
in security

649
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:36,640
who wants to talk
to you, Commander.

650
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:45,106
Come in quickly, Doctor.
You're late.

651
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:47,025
It's 2057.

652
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,485
Now just take this

653
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:50,195
and try it on
as many times as you like.

654
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:53,532
And stay very,
very quiet.
I was just...

655
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,793
(<i> door opening</i> )

656
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,170
GARAK:
Ah, right on time.

657
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,714
Welcome.

658
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:11,299
B'ETOR:
Save your welcome,
Cardassian.

659
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:14,260
Do your people
want the Bajoran or not?

660
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,806
GARAK:
I can now venture to say,
with some certainty

661
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:20,851
that you will receive
the agreed-upon payment

662
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:22,310
on delivery.

663
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,355
We will complete
our business with Tahna Los

664
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:26,565
in four hours.

665
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:28,650
And what business
might that be?

666
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,777
That is not your concern.

667
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,739
If it requires
that those I represent

668
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:37,158
must take extra precautions,
it becomes my concern.

669
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:42,205
We will deliver him
a cylinder of bilitrium.

670
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,082
The rendezvous will be

671
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:47,627
on the dark side
of Bajor VIII's lower moon.

672
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:51,339
The Cardassians
can have him then.

673
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,311
What's bilitrium?

674
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:07,146
Ah, a rare,
crystalline element

675
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:10,191
that can be an incredibly
powerful source of energy

676
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:13,028
provided, of course, one has
an antimatter converter.

677
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:15,614
Unfortunately,
that's why Cardassians

678
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:18,658
were chasing Tahna Los
when he arrived here.

679
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,953
He stole one.

680
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:23,538
But if he's got both...

681
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:24,748
Quite right, Doctor.

682
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:27,000
He has the ingredients
for a bomb--

683
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,547
a bomb of significant
destructive capability.

684
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,226
We have nothing
to hold them on.

685
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,062
They haven't
committed any crime yet.

686
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:48,647
Conspiracy is a crime.

687
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:50,189
Conspiracy
to what?

688
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:52,025
We don't even
know what
their plan is.

689
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:53,902
Once the switch with
the Klingons is made

690
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:55,153
you've got them holding
the components

691
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,446
to an explosive device.

692
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:57,948
That's evidence
enough right there.

693
00:35:57,948 --> 00:35:59,574
Chief O'Brien is right.

694
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,618
We have to give
them the runabout.

695
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:02,577
Agreed.

696
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,746
And I have to be on it.

697
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:05,831
Not agreed, Major.

698
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:07,248
Commander,
Tahna doesn't know

699
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:08,792
if he can trust me
as it is.

700
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:10,919
If I try to stay behind,
he won't buy into this.

701
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:13,880
The only way
to convince him
is if I'm on board.

702
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,214
If Tahna fails

703
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,634
I promise you,
others will try.

704
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:20,012
At least this way,
you can find out

705
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:21,680
what they're up to.

706
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,764
Mr. O'Brien

707
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:24,141
you and I will take a runabout

708
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:26,059
to a point behind
the second moon of Bajor VIII

709
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:27,853
to avoid detection.
Aye, sir.

710
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:30,856
Dax, stay in touch with us
on a secured channel.

711
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:33,066
Keep an eye
on the Cardassians.

712
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:35,152
They'll be coming
to the party, too.

713
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,739
You get him there, Major.

714
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,867
We'll be waiting.

715
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:53,628
They're moving
into the runabout.

716
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:54,671
Acknowledged.

717
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:55,588
DS9 to<i> Ganges.</i>

718
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:56,965
SISKO:
<i>Go ahead.</i>

719
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:58,633
<i>They're in the Yangtzee Kiang.</i>

720
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,719
<i>They're initializing</i>
<i>prelaunch systems now.</i>

721
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,054
Understood, Lieutenant.

722
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:04,514
Shut down
all main power systems.

723
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:10,645
(<i> sighs</i> )

724
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:13,732
Dead quiet.

725
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:23,408
Bajor VIII
in 120,000 kilometers.

726
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,451
Dropping to impulse.

727
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:31,541
What is that?

728
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:35,378
An antimatter converter.

729
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,672
I'm transferring power
from the ship's warp drive

730
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:38,631
into the storage cells.

731
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,466
(<i> console beeps</i> )

732
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,635
We've got a Klingon bird-of-prey
de-cloaking dead ahead.

733
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:43,970
It's all right.

734
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,598
We're here to meet them.

735
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:49,642
Klingons? Why?

736
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,603
You'll know soon enough.

737
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:02,072
The Klingons have powered up
their transporters.

738
00:38:02,072 --> 00:38:03,949
Prepare to go to full impulse.

739
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:14,834
13 kilograms

740
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,836
of gold-pressed latinum,
as promised.

741
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,213
This is yours.

742
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:22,968
<i>'eH. HImaH!</i>

743
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:27,764
What is it?

744
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:30,516
Bajoran independence.

745
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:37,482
Bird-of-prey
is moving off
and cloaking.

746
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,734
Set up an intercept course
for the runabout.

747
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,569
Intercept
in one minute

748
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:42,612
12 seconds.

749
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:48,160
DS9 to<i> Ganges.</i>

750
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,744
<i>Ganges.</i>

751
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,663
The Cardassian warship<i> Aldara</i>

752
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,456
is crossing the border,
Benjamin

753
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,917
on an intercept course
with the<i> Yangtzee Kiang.</i>

754
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:57,836
They'll enter Bajoran space

755
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:59,129
<i>in 29 seconds.</i>

756
00:38:59,129 --> 00:39:01,006
Acknowledged.

757
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:03,842
The<i> Yangtzee's</i> sensors should
be picking us up now, sir.

758
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,097
TAHNA:
What is that?

759
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:10,932
It's another runabout.

760
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:13,601
They must have been
waiting for us here.

761
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,436
How did they know?

762
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,647
We also have a Cardassian
warship three minutes away.

763
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:20,150
The Klingons must have
sold us out.

764
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,027
Prepare to engage warp engines.

765
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:23,736
There's nowhere to run,
Tahna.

766
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:24,988
We don't have to go far.

767
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,788
I should have known.

768
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,957
Now set the course for DS9.

769
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:37,625
No.
If you don't,

770
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,627
I'll explode the bomb
right here and destroy

771
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,881
all six colonies
on Bajor VIII.

772
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:45,466
You would kill thousands
of your own people for this?

773
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,552
The question is
whether you would kill them

774
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:48,887
by refusing to set the course.

775
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:01,816
They've gone to warp.

776
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,151
Follow them.

777
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:05,570
<i>Ganges</i> to<i> Yangtzee Kiang.</i>

778
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:09,824
<i>Drop out of warp,</i>
<i>or we'll open fire.</i>

779
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,077
<i>Repeat--</i>
<i>reduce your power immediately</i>

780
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:13,619
<i>or we will open fire.</i>

781
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:17,582
I doubt he'll shoot
while his Major is on board

782
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,042
but just in case...

783
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,877
This is the voice
of the<i> Kohn-Ma.</i>

784
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:23,046
<i>There is an armed</i>
<i>bilitrium explosive device</i>

785
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:24,339
<i>onboard this ship.</i>

786
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:27,884
Fire on us,
and you will detonate it.

787
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:30,511
If that device goes off
while they're at warp

788
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,347
they'll spread radiation
across half the system.

789
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:34,933
He's headed straight back
to the station.

790
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,271
This is the Federation
Vessel<i> Ganges</i>

791
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:41,606
to the Cardassian
warship<i> Aldara.</i>

792
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:45,902
So... we're finally allies,
Commander.

793
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:47,153
Gul Danar

794
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,947
the Federation Runabout
<i>Yangtzee Kiang</i>

795
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:50,740
is carrying an explosive
bilitrium device.

796
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,450
Can you intercept

797
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,577
before it reaches
the space station?

798
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,871
Our time to intercept
is two minutes, 14 seconds.

799
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,664
That's about a minute
too late, Commander.

800
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:01,000
If I may take
this opportunity to say

801
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,835
that I warned you...

802
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:04,837
Can we get them
in a tractor beam?

803
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,172
Not at these speeds.

804
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:08,174
They have 27
seconds on us.

805
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:10,843
We may have to shoot
them down, Commander.

806
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:13,346
Ready photons, Chief.

807
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:15,598
We'll fire as soon
as they slow to impulse.

808
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,100
Aye, sir.

809
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:27,444
100,000 kilometers
to DS9.

810
00:41:27,444 --> 00:41:30,280
This is your idea of
a nonviolent solution?

811
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,365
You realize
there are hundreds

812
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:34,617
of Bajoran civilians
aboard the station?

813
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:37,370
No one's going
to be hurt, Kira.

814
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:39,914
Adjust your course
to take a vectored approach

815
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,250
past the mouth
of the wormhole.

816
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,709
The wormhole...

817
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:47,088
It's not the space station
you're after.

818
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:49,174
You can't
possibly believe
you can destroy

819
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:51,217
the wormhole with that device?

820
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:54,095
I don't have to destroy it--
just collapse the entrance.

821
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:58,266
You're only hurting Bajor
by doing this, Tahna.

822
00:41:58,266 --> 00:41:59,392
No more wormhole,

823
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:02,437
no more Federation
or Cardassians...

824
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,856
or anyone.

825
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:06,941
Drop out of warp.

826
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:10,362
Now!

827
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,908
My God, they're going
into the wormhole

828
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:16,951
at full impulse.

829
00:43:04,541 --> 00:43:05,833
Damn you.

830
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,626
<i>Sisko to Kira.</i>

831
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:09,879
<i>Are you all right, Major?</i>

832
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:12,882
No, she's not all right,
Commander!

833
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:15,760
And if you want her alive,
you'll do exactly as I say!

834
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,303
<i>Listen to me carefully, Tahna.</i>

835
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:19,680
You can either
surrender now, to me

836
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,434
or you can wait
for the Cardassian warship,

837
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:25,644
<i>and I can let them</i>
deal with you this time.

838
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:26,771
Your choice.

839
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:45,123
There'll be no further
resistance, Commander.

840
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:02,890
Tahna...

841
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,310
the old ways
don't work anymore.

842
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:07,562
Everything
is different now.

843
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,855
I had to do this.

844
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,732
One day, you'll understand.

845
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:15,069
Traitor.
