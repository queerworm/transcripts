1
00:00:10,848 --> 00:00:12,340
Do you need me, Julian?

2
00:00:12,385 --> 00:00:13,786
How did you know it was me?

3
00:00:13,821 --> 00:00:15,882
There are different ways
to recognize someone.

4
00:00:15,925 --> 00:00:18,590
The rhythm of their steps,
for example.

5
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:19,964
You are remarkable.

6
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:22,495
Julian, you and I
need to have a talk

7
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,807
about Trills and relationships.

8
00:00:24,845 --> 00:00:26,678
Fine.
We'll do it over supper.

9
00:00:26,716 --> 00:00:28,949
Quark has found me this
delightfully dry champagne

10
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:30,821
estate bottled on Korris I.

11
00:00:30,858 --> 00:00:31,951
Julian...

12
00:00:31,994 --> 00:00:33,623
What is this?

13
00:00:33,664 --> 00:00:35,429
An Altonian brain teaser.

14
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:37,838
A brain teaser?

15
00:00:37,873 --> 00:00:39,000
A puzzle.

16
00:00:39,043 --> 00:00:40,170
A puzzle?

17
00:00:40,212 --> 00:00:41,305
Mmm.

18
00:00:43,352 --> 00:00:44,878
I love puzzles.

19
00:00:44,923 --> 00:00:46,950
How does it work?

20
00:00:46,993 --> 00:00:49,157
It responds
to neural theta waves.

21
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:52,502
The goal is to turn the sphere
into a solid color.

22
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:53,838
And that's all?

23
00:00:53,876 --> 00:00:55,003
That's all.

24
00:00:55,045 --> 00:00:57,015
I've been trying to master it

25
00:00:57,049 --> 00:01:00,113
on and off for, oh, 140 years.

26
00:01:00,156 --> 00:01:02,992
Would you care to try?

27
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:04,726
Yes.

28
00:01:04,766 --> 00:01:06,999
Just sit comfortably.

29
00:01:08,407 --> 00:01:11,208
And release your tension
into my hands.

30
00:01:11,247 --> 00:01:12,876
Your hands, they're cold.

31
00:01:12,917 --> 00:01:15,218
It's a peculiarity
of the Trill.

32
00:01:15,256 --> 00:01:16,885
Cold hands, warm heart.

33
00:01:16,926 --> 00:01:18,862
Concentrate on the sphere.

34
00:01:18,898 --> 00:01:20,595
Clear your mind.

35
00:01:20,635 --> 00:01:23,402
This requires focus
and clarity of thought.

36
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,410
I understand completely.

37
00:01:25,444 --> 00:01:28,747
What is that exotic scent
you're wearing?

38
00:01:28,785 --> 00:01:30,254
Focus

39
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:32,259
and clarity of thought.

40
00:01:32,327 --> 00:01:34,263
Yes, yes, I have it.

41
00:01:34,331 --> 00:01:37,030
I'm going to release it
to you now, okay?

42
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,269
Okay.

43
00:01:40,377 --> 00:01:41,812
Computer...

44
00:01:41,847 --> 00:01:45,309
transfer control
to second player.

45
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:53,534
I think your mind is still
a little busy, Julian.

46
00:01:53,573 --> 00:01:57,172
Wel... So, are you
free for supper?

47
00:01:58,184 --> 00:01:59,152
Ready, Dax?

48
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:00,712
Sorry.

49
00:02:00,756 --> 00:02:02,316
Perhaps another time.

50
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,627
Maybe you'd like to try again.

51
00:02:04,664 --> 00:02:06,156
Doctor.

52
00:02:10,076 --> 00:02:12,274
Computer...

53
00:02:12,315 --> 00:02:14,080
reset.

54
00:04:22,565 --> 00:04:24,763
Business is good, Quark.

55
00:04:24,836 --> 00:04:27,273
You're almost making
an honest living.

56
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,244
A lot of new faces.

57
00:04:31,016 --> 00:04:32,349
Hmm.

58
00:04:32,385 --> 00:04:35,790
The wormhole does bring
them our way, doesn't it?

59
00:04:35,827 --> 00:04:39,289
Everyone wants a piece
of the new frontier.

60
00:04:39,335 --> 00:04:41,362
And I'm sure you've
already tried

61
00:04:41,405 --> 00:04:43,204
to sell it to a few of them.

62
00:04:43,243 --> 00:04:45,179
We made the decision together.

63
00:04:45,214 --> 00:04:47,344
That's not true.
That's not true.

64
00:04:47,385 --> 00:04:48,580
What?

65
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,524
You decided and asked
me to agree with it.

66
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:54,226
Grapevine says Chief O'Brien
and the missus

67
00:04:54,268 --> 00:04:57,172
are having problems.

68
00:04:57,207 --> 00:05:02,344
I'll never understand
the humanoid need to...

69
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,082
couple.

70
00:05:05,425 --> 00:05:09,058
You've never... coupled?

71
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:10,659
Choose not to.

72
00:05:10,703 --> 00:05:12,297
Too many compromises.

73
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,210
You want to watch the
Karo-Net tournament.

74
00:05:15,247 --> 00:05:17,718
She wants to listen to music.

75
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:19,221
So, you compromise.

76
00:05:19,256 --> 00:05:21,021
You listen to music.

77
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,329
You like Earth jazz.
She prefers Klingon opera.

78
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:26,166
So, you compromise.

79
00:05:26,204 --> 00:05:28,573
You listen to Klingon opera.

80
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,239
So, here you were

81
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,415
ready to have a nice night
watching the Karo-Net match

82
00:05:34,456 --> 00:05:37,360
and you wind up spending
an agonizing evening

83
00:05:37,395 --> 00:05:39,160
listening to Klingon opera.

84
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,726
That's exactly...

85
00:05:41,739 --> 00:05:43,869
Keiko, sit down.

86
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:46,039
I didn't mean...

87
00:05:46,081 --> 00:05:48,051
What could they
be going on about

88
00:05:48,085 --> 00:05:49,554
like that, anyway?

89
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:51,388
She doesn't like it here.

90
00:05:51,426 --> 00:05:54,558
Mmm. Who does?

91
00:06:02,383 --> 00:06:04,684
Ah...

92
00:06:04,722 --> 00:06:06,749
Don't even think about it.

93
00:06:06,794 --> 00:06:09,767
I can so think about it.

94
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,103
You might as well try
to find a drink of water

95
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,110
on the Yadozi Desert.

96
00:06:15,145 --> 00:06:17,810
Besides, I'd say
our new Commander

97
00:06:17,851 --> 00:06:19,548
is interested in her.

98
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,182
Not at all.

99
00:06:21,225 --> 00:06:25,895
I know for a fact
that when she was a he

100
00:06:26,002 --> 00:06:27,479
you know...

101
00:06:27,612 --> 00:06:29,445
before she got this new body...

102
00:06:29,483 --> 00:06:31,316
they were old friends.

103
00:06:31,353 --> 00:06:33,050
Things change.

104
00:06:34,126 --> 00:06:35,720
All right, now here we go.

105
00:06:39,305 --> 00:06:41,275
How long has he been here?

106
00:06:41,309 --> 00:06:43,678
All right, one more time.

107
00:06:43,714 --> 00:06:47,313
He came in on a transport
last night.

108
00:06:47,355 --> 00:06:49,154
Oh...

109
00:06:49,192 --> 00:06:50,718
Something to eat?

110
00:06:50,762 --> 00:06:52,425
Just steamed azna.

111
00:06:53,569 --> 00:06:57,202
Well, some things
are still the same.

112
00:06:57,243 --> 00:06:59,076
If you'd listen to me

113
00:06:59,114 --> 00:07:01,779
you would eat
steamed azna, too.

114
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:03,450
Dax, did I ever tell you
about the meals

115
00:07:03,491 --> 00:07:05,689
my father used to cook for us
when we were children?

116
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:07,528
All the time.

117
00:07:07,566 --> 00:07:10,835
Every night in my house,
my dad insisted

118
00:07:10,873 --> 00:07:13,846
that we have supper together
as a family.

119
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,181
He would try out
his new recipes on us.

120
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:18,212
He used to call us
his test tasters.

121
00:07:18,256 --> 00:07:21,229
Steamed azna would put
years on your life.

122
00:07:21,263 --> 00:07:24,030
Dax, I don't want years
on my life

123
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:26,563
if I can only eat steamed azna.

124
00:07:26,608 --> 00:07:29,239
Sautéed...

125
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,013
rolloped, fricasseed... fine.

126
00:07:32,053 --> 00:07:34,786
But not steamed.

127
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,535
I've missed your steamed azna.

128
00:07:44,448 --> 00:07:47,318
You must miss Curzon, too.

129
00:07:47,353 --> 00:07:49,984
He was...

130
00:07:50,026 --> 00:07:53,158
you were, are...

131
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,605
a mentor,
another father to me.

132
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,547
This happens to Trills,
Benjamin.

133
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:04,547
Sometimes our friendships
with other species don't survive

134
00:08:04,592 --> 00:08:06,619
because of the change.

135
00:08:06,662 --> 00:08:08,895
It won't be that way with us.

136
00:08:08,934 --> 00:08:11,633
It's just a little uncomfortable
right now.

137
00:08:11,673 --> 00:08:15,078
I suggest
that you allow yourself

138
00:08:15,114 --> 00:08:19,283
to feel comfortable
with your discomfort.

139
00:08:19,323 --> 00:08:21,419
Time can do the rest.

140
00:08:21,462 --> 00:08:23,227
I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

141
00:08:23,266 --> 00:08:24,393
Keiko...

142
00:08:35,726 --> 00:08:37,822
Dabo!

143
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,896
All right.

144
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,187
I don't want you
on this station.

145
00:08:49,222 --> 00:08:50,623
Yeah, well, that's too bad

146
00:08:50,659 --> 00:08:52,720
because I have
every right to be here.

147
00:08:52,764 --> 00:08:53,925
I decide who has rights

148
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,732
and who doesn't
on this Promenade.

149
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,640
You better ask your Federation
superiors about that one.

150
00:08:58,677 --> 00:09:00,841
I don't have to check
with anyone.

151
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:16,606
You have 26 hours
to get off this station.

152
00:09:24,668 --> 00:09:26,638
Look, I'm willing
to ask for a transfer

153
00:09:26,672 --> 00:09:28,073
if that will make you happy.

154
00:09:28,108 --> 00:09:29,907
That's not fair either.

155
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:32,416
You'd have to give up
your promotion.

156
00:09:32,451 --> 00:09:33,920
Not necessarily.

157
00:09:33,954 --> 00:09:36,084
I wish I knew
the right thing to do.

158
00:09:36,126 --> 00:09:37,527
I'm just lost here.

159
00:09:37,629 --> 00:09:40,328
Starfleet doesn't need
a botanist on this station.

160
00:09:40,369 --> 00:09:42,236
Keiko, there's
a whole new quadrant

161
00:09:42,273 --> 00:09:44,403
on the other side
of the wormhole

162
00:09:44,444 --> 00:09:46,243
full of new plant life
to explore.

163
00:09:46,282 --> 00:09:48,412
And ships going to explore it

164
00:09:48,453 --> 00:09:50,423
and I'm not on any of them.

165
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,827
We'll be sending runabouts
through the wormhole.

166
00:09:52,863 --> 00:09:54,298
I'll see to it you get to go.

167
00:09:54,332 --> 00:09:56,462
I don't need favors from you.

168
00:09:56,504 --> 00:09:58,737
I just need to be useful.

169
00:10:02,016 --> 00:10:04,043
Just think how much
more attractive

170
00:10:04,087 --> 00:10:06,080
this place could be
if you planted

171
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,528
some trees and flowers
in the Promenade.

172
00:10:08,563 --> 00:10:10,226
You could even
create an arboretum

173
00:10:10,267 --> 00:10:12,066
from the new specimens
we bring back

174
00:10:12,105 --> 00:10:13,972
from the Gamma Quadrant.

175
00:10:19,622 --> 00:10:21,592
Do you really want
to raise your daughter

176
00:10:21,626 --> 00:10:23,619
in this place, Miles?

177
00:10:23,731 --> 00:10:25,724
Kira to O'Brien.

178
00:10:25,768 --> 00:10:28,069
Go ahead.

179
00:10:28,107 --> 00:10:32,481
We have a nonfunctional power
transfer grid on level five.

180
00:10:32,516 --> 00:10:35,648
All of the upper docking pylons
are out of commission.

181
00:10:35,757 --> 00:10:37,249
On my way.

182
00:10:48,384 --> 00:10:50,013
Hi!

183
00:10:50,055 --> 00:10:52,025
What do you want, hu-man?

184
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,689
My name's Jake.

185
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,359
I know who you are.

186
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,801
What's yours?

187
00:10:56,836 --> 00:10:58,362
Why do you care?

188
00:10:58,406 --> 00:11:01,207
Not exactly a lot of friends
to choose from around here.

189
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,773
You know what I mean.

190
00:11:05,756 --> 00:11:06,883
Nog.

191
00:11:06,925 --> 00:11:08,588
My name is Nog.

192
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:14,268
His name is Ibudan.

193
00:11:14,308 --> 00:11:16,973
He used to run
black market goods through here

194
00:11:17,014 --> 00:11:19,542
to the surface
during the Cardassian occupation

195
00:11:19,587 --> 00:11:21,683
gouging his fellow men

196
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:23,694
who needed medical supplies
and so forth.

197
00:11:23,763 --> 00:11:27,168
Some Bajorans actually
considered him a hero

198
00:11:27,203 --> 00:11:30,938
but I saw him let a child die
when the parents couldn't afford

199
00:11:30,978 --> 00:11:32,845
the drug that would have
saved her life.

200
00:11:32,882 --> 00:11:37,187
A few years back, he killed
a Cardassian officer

201
00:11:37,225 --> 00:11:39,856
who wanted a payoff
to look the other way.

202
00:11:39,898 --> 00:11:42,062
He went to prison for murder.

203
00:11:42,103 --> 00:11:43,572
I sent him there.

204
00:11:43,605 --> 00:11:45,974
For murder?
What's he doing out?

205
00:11:46,011 --> 00:11:48,539
The provisional government
let him go.

206
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,109
Killing a Cardassian

207
00:11:50,153 --> 00:11:52,681
isn't considered
much of a crime nowadays.

208
00:11:52,726 --> 00:11:55,357
Doesn't sound like there's
much we can do about it.

209
00:11:55,398 --> 00:11:57,528
I can get him off my Promenade.

210
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,700
If he hasn't done anything wrong

211
00:11:59,742 --> 00:12:02,009
you can't just arbitrarily
force him to leave.

212
00:12:02,046 --> 00:12:03,709
Watch me.

213
00:12:03,817 --> 00:12:05,446
Mr. Odo

214
00:12:05,488 --> 00:12:08,655
you're not going to take the law
into your own hands.

215
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:10,061
The law?

216
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:13,936
Commander, laws change
depending on who's making them.

217
00:12:13,973 --> 00:12:16,706
Cardassians one day,
Federation the next.

218
00:12:16,745 --> 00:12:19,080
But justice is justice

219
00:12:19,117 --> 00:12:20,278
and as long as I'm

220
00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:21,652
in charge of secur...

221
00:12:21,689 --> 00:12:23,591
If you can't work
within the rules

222
00:12:23,627 --> 00:12:25,153
I'll find someone who can.

223
00:13:31,597 --> 00:13:34,068
What are they?

224
00:13:34,103 --> 00:13:37,976
Garanian bolites.

225
00:13:38,011 --> 00:13:39,378
Come on!

226
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,856
I guess I know
the competition now.

227
00:13:44,893 --> 00:13:47,023
What are you talking
about, Julian?

228
00:13:47,064 --> 00:13:49,535
Well, did you have a nice dinner
with Commander Sisko?

229
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,403
Julian, Trills do not
look for romance

230
00:13:51,508 --> 00:13:52,703
the same way humans do.

231
00:13:52,744 --> 00:13:54,874
In fact, we find it
quite a nuisance.

232
00:13:54,915 --> 00:13:56,407
A nuisance?

233
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:59,720
It's a weakness of the young,
and although a Trill host

234
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,993
may have these...
feelings occasionally

235
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,331
it is our wish
to live on a higher plane

236
00:14:04,369 --> 00:14:07,342
to try to rise above
these kinds of temptations.

237
00:14:07,376 --> 00:14:09,346
You said "try to rise above"

238
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,316
which suggests you
don't always succeed.

239
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,082
Julian...

240
00:14:13,122 --> 00:14:15,024
Sisko to Dr. Bashir.

241
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:16,288
Go ahead.

242
00:14:16,328 --> 00:14:17,763
We need medical assistance

243
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,530
above the bar in Holosuite Four.

244
00:14:19,569 --> 00:14:20,936
Acknowledged, Commander.

245
00:14:20,972 --> 00:14:22,669
I still have that champagne.

246
00:14:24,881 --> 00:14:26,714
On ice.

247
00:14:34,903 --> 00:14:37,876
Are you done with your shift?

248
00:14:37,909 --> 00:14:39,503
Gym's not open tonight.

249
00:15:04,034 --> 00:15:05,435
Help us!

250
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:07,006
Somebody help us!

251
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,235
Something is happening to us!

252
00:15:08,277 --> 00:15:09,267
Get a doctor!

253
00:15:44,289 --> 00:15:46,522
The door opened only twice.

254
00:15:46,628 --> 00:15:51,264
The first time when the computer
logged Ibudan's check-in

255
00:15:51,304 --> 00:15:53,434
at 1700 hours, 16 minutes.

256
00:15:53,476 --> 00:15:57,109
The suite was secured,
so no one else could enter.

257
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,351
He ran Lauriento massage
holoprogram #101A.

258
00:16:00,391 --> 00:16:01,951
13 minutes later

259
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,431
the door was opened
for the second time

260
00:16:04,466 --> 00:16:06,869
but since Ibudan
obviously didn't exit

261
00:16:06,905 --> 00:16:09,809
we have to assume
that's when the killer left.

262
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:12,509
Any evidence of a beam-in
during those 13 minutes?

263
00:16:12,618 --> 00:16:13,917
No.

264
00:16:13,953 --> 00:16:15,650
Well then,
how did the killer get in?

265
00:16:15,691 --> 00:16:17,320
He might have
entered the holosuite

266
00:16:17,361 --> 00:16:18,522
the same time Ibudan did.

267
00:16:18,631 --> 00:16:21,034
Cause of death's no mystery.

268
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,437
The knife was thrust

269
00:16:22,473 --> 00:16:24,637
directly between the left
and right thoracic vertebrae

270
00:16:24,677 --> 00:16:26,544
perforating the lower ventricle
of the heart.

271
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:28,710
The murderer apparently
had a decent knowledge

272
00:16:28,753 --> 00:16:30,052
of Bajoran anatomy.

273
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,217
Doctor, I want you

274
00:16:31,258 --> 00:16:33,559
to look for evidence
that could establish

275
00:16:33,664 --> 00:16:35,566
that someone was
in here with him.

276
00:16:35,668 --> 00:16:37,262
I'll do a sweep
for hair follicles

277
00:16:37,305 --> 00:16:39,674
any skin or cellular
remnants and DNA fragments.

278
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:42,808
How many ships have
left since yesterday?

279
00:16:42,851 --> 00:16:44,377
Hmm, two.

280
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:47,986
A Federation survey ship
and a Vulcan science vessel.

281
00:16:48,028 --> 00:16:49,429
Advise all ships in dock

282
00:16:49,465 --> 00:16:52,734
that departures will be delayed
until further notice.

283
00:17:05,935 --> 00:17:08,463
And they were just looking
for trouble.

284
00:17:08,507 --> 00:17:12,312
Those kids had no reason to be
hanging around the Promenade.

285
00:17:12,348 --> 00:17:14,581
It's about the only place
they have to go.

286
00:17:14,687 --> 00:17:16,817
We can't keep them
locked in their rooms.

287
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:18,488
This isn't like a starship,
Miles.

288
00:17:18,529 --> 00:17:21,160
The kind of freedom children
have on the <i>Enterprise</i>

289
00:17:21,202 --> 00:17:23,229
just won't work
on a space station.

290
00:17:23,272 --> 00:17:26,245
There are too many ways to get
into serious trouble here.

291
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:28,750
What this place needs
is a school.

292
00:17:35,733 --> 00:17:38,034
All ships have been informed
of the delays, Commander.

293
00:17:38,072 --> 00:17:39,507
Major, do you know

294
00:17:39,542 --> 00:17:43,004
Mr. Zayra, who operates
the Transit Aid Center?

295
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:44,017
We've met.

296
00:17:44,051 --> 00:17:45,918
He was just telling me
something disturbing.

297
00:17:45,956 --> 00:17:47,425
I think you should hear it.

298
00:17:47,459 --> 00:17:49,292
It's just that the murdered man,
lbudan...

299
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,959
I spoke to him yesterday

300
00:17:51,001 --> 00:17:53,131
about an hour
before it happened.

301
00:17:53,171 --> 00:17:54,298
Where was this?

302
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:55,240
Quark's.

303
00:17:55,277 --> 00:17:57,578
By the dabo table.

304
00:17:57,615 --> 00:18:01,681
It was after his struggle
with the shape-shifter.

305
00:18:01,724 --> 00:18:04,355
He told me that he was scared.

306
00:18:04,397 --> 00:18:08,030
He was afraid
that Odo would kill him.

307
00:18:09,574 --> 00:18:11,635
There isn't a more honorable man

308
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,877
on this station
than the Constable.

309
00:18:13,917 --> 00:18:15,181
Maybe so.

310
00:18:17,358 --> 00:18:20,525
All I know is, an hour
later, Ibudan was dead.

311
00:18:31,456 --> 00:18:33,426
Computer, lights.

312
00:18:33,461 --> 00:18:36,092
This was Ibudan's quarters.

313
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:38,604
Feel free to look around.

314
00:18:38,638 --> 00:18:40,437
Double accommodations?

315
00:18:40,476 --> 00:18:42,002
That's what he requested

316
00:18:42,046 --> 00:18:43,982
but only one passenger
was logged in.

317
00:18:44,017 --> 00:18:46,511
He probably just wanted
larger quarters.

318
00:18:46,555 --> 00:18:48,719
If there's anything
else you need...

319
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:51,298
I want a record of all
the passengers on board.

320
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,962
Of course.

321
00:18:53,003 --> 00:18:55,406
I'll get you a copy
of the ship's manifest.

322
00:18:58,415 --> 00:19:01,752
Computer, how many entries
made from this terminal

323
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,692
during the last 78 hours?

324
00:19:03,794 --> 00:19:06,698
Seven entries noted
in personal calendar files.

325
00:19:06,801 --> 00:19:08,395
Show them to me.

326
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:15,246
Take me to Stardate 46384.

327
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:37,197
You won't get any argument
from me, Mrs. O'Brien.

328
00:19:37,235 --> 00:19:39,900
When I heard what happened
this morning on the Promenade...

329
00:19:39,941 --> 00:19:41,911
We weren't doing anything.

330
00:19:41,946 --> 00:19:44,247
I don't want to talk
about this now.

331
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:46,254
It's this Ferengi boy, Nog...

332
00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:50,355
Jake won't be having
anything more to do with him.

333
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:52,869
He's the only one here
even close to my age.

334
00:19:52,903 --> 00:19:54,839
That's not exactly true, Jake.

335
00:19:54,874 --> 00:19:57,141
There are 12 other children
on board

336
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:58,773
ranging from eight to 16.

337
00:19:58,816 --> 00:20:02,381
The problem is, there's
no structured activity for them.

338
00:20:02,424 --> 00:20:06,559
Don't you miss the schools
you used to go to, Jake?

339
00:20:06,667 --> 00:20:08,136
No... I guess.

340
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,300
Studying alone
on the computer...

341
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:12,711
it kind of gets
boring sometimes.

342
00:20:12,747 --> 00:20:15,948
You know, I've never actually
been a teacher, Commander

343
00:20:15,987 --> 00:20:19,586
but it's something I've
always thought about doing.

344
00:20:19,629 --> 00:20:21,064
As a Starfleet Commander
and a father

345
00:20:21,099 --> 00:20:22,294
I think it's a terrific idea.

346
00:20:22,334 --> 00:20:23,461
What do you need?

347
00:20:23,503 --> 00:20:24,596
Uh...

348
00:20:24,673 --> 00:20:26,472
some space.

349
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,569
We'll find it.

350
00:20:27,612 --> 00:20:30,175
Computers?

351
00:20:30,218 --> 00:20:32,348
You'll have them.

352
00:20:34,027 --> 00:20:36,624
I hope you realize what you're
getting yourself into.

353
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:39,263
I can't force the Bajora,
the Ferengi or anyone else

354
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:41,172
to send their children
to your school.

355
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,371
And even if they do come

356
00:20:42,412 --> 00:20:44,177
everyone has a different culture

357
00:20:44,216 --> 00:20:45,549
a different philosophy.

358
00:20:45,586 --> 00:20:48,217
I know I'll have to come up
with an innovative program

359
00:20:48,258 --> 00:20:50,228
but I can't imagine any parent

360
00:20:50,263 --> 00:20:53,167
not welcoming the news
of a school opening here.

361
00:20:53,202 --> 00:20:55,195
Thank you, Commander.

362
00:21:00,285 --> 00:21:03,816
If I hear of you
hanging around with him...

363
00:21:03,859 --> 00:21:07,664
I thought you didn't want
to talk about this now.

364
00:21:10,741 --> 00:21:12,301
These are the DNA
sequence analyses

365
00:21:12,344 --> 00:21:13,573
the cellular spectrographs

366
00:21:13,614 --> 00:21:15,311
and the particulate
matter tracers.

367
00:21:15,351 --> 00:21:17,652
I asked Lieutenant Dax
to confirm my findings

368
00:21:17,689 --> 00:21:18,988
and I'm afraid she concurs.

369
00:21:19,026 --> 00:21:23,491
There were no new DNA traces
found in the holosuite.

370
00:21:23,535 --> 00:21:26,405
You're saying nobody went
into the room with him.

371
00:21:26,442 --> 00:21:28,879
Well, apart from those of us
who were in there

372
00:21:28,914 --> 00:21:32,319
after the body was discovered,
this was the only DNA present.

373
00:21:32,355 --> 00:21:34,519
And we've identified
it as Ibudan's.

374
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,528
Wait a minute.

375
00:21:35,562 --> 00:21:37,429
Ibudan goes
into the holosuite alone

376
00:21:37,466 --> 00:21:38,661
locks the door.

377
00:21:38,703 --> 00:21:40,229
Nobody transports in.

378
00:21:40,272 --> 00:21:41,935
A few minutes later,
he's murdered.

379
00:21:41,976 --> 00:21:43,343
How is that possible?

380
00:21:43,379 --> 00:21:44,506
It's not...

381
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:46,850
unless the murder was committed

382
00:21:46,887 --> 00:21:50,520
by someone who could get through
the cracks in the door.

383
00:21:50,562 --> 00:21:53,056
Say... a shape-shifter.

384
00:22:08,234 --> 00:22:09,533
It's a pretty neat package.

385
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:12,098
His calendar shows he was
planning to meet with me

386
00:22:12,143 --> 00:22:13,407
at the time of the murder.

387
00:22:13,445 --> 00:22:16,475
No one except a shape-shifter
could get into the holosuite.

388
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:18,489
And since I'd obviously
be called there

389
00:22:18,523 --> 00:22:19,924
after the body was discovered

390
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,557
traces of my DNA wind up
at the scene of the crime.

391
00:22:22,598 --> 00:22:24,967
Do you have
any kind of an alibi?

392
00:22:25,004 --> 00:22:27,943
Major, I have to return
to my natural state

393
00:22:27,978 --> 00:22:29,914
every 18 hours to regenerate.

394
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:31,747
To be quite honest about it

395
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:34,518
I was in a pail
in the back of my office

396
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,119
when Ibudan was killed.

397
00:22:36,161 --> 00:22:39,657
The killer might have known
your regenerative cycle

398
00:22:39,703 --> 00:22:42,106
and planned the murder
accordingly.

399
00:22:42,142 --> 00:22:44,978
Like I said, a neat package.

400
00:22:45,015 --> 00:22:48,250
Who might want
to frame you for murder?

401
00:22:48,288 --> 00:22:51,261
I can think of
about 500 different people

402
00:22:51,295 --> 00:22:54,996
but I haven't seen any of them
around the station recently.

403
00:22:57,977 --> 00:22:59,776
Do you think
that Federation doctor

404
00:22:59,814 --> 00:23:03,447
could do a sweep
of Ibudan's quarters for me?

405
00:23:03,488 --> 00:23:04,752
See if he can find out

406
00:23:04,792 --> 00:23:07,320
if somebody else was using
that second bed?

407
00:23:07,364 --> 00:23:10,735
I'll send him
over there right away.

408
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:14,043
Thank you, Major.

409
00:23:19,256 --> 00:23:20,383
Dabo!

410
00:23:20,425 --> 00:23:23,592
You want my boy to go
to a Federation school?

411
00:23:23,632 --> 00:23:25,101
Not just Federation.

412
00:23:25,136 --> 00:23:27,106
I'm developing a curriculum

413
00:23:27,141 --> 00:23:29,111
that will take
a much broader approach.

414
00:23:29,145 --> 00:23:30,808
Little lady, little lady.

415
00:23:30,882 --> 00:23:33,445
What do you know
of Ferengi education?

416
00:23:33,488 --> 00:23:36,552
I understand you employ
a work-study approach, Mr. Rom

417
00:23:36,595 --> 00:23:38,964
with apprenticeships
in a wide range

418
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,130
of business and economic fields.

419
00:23:42,641 --> 00:23:45,614
We throw them
into the cutthroat competition

420
00:23:45,648 --> 00:23:47,049
of Ferengi commerce

421
00:23:47,084 --> 00:23:49,555
and anyone who survives,
graduates.

422
00:23:49,589 --> 00:23:51,719
Are you prepared
to teach that to my son?

423
00:23:51,761 --> 00:23:54,734
I'm sure I couldn't improve on
what you've already taught him

424
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:56,067
in that department.

425
00:23:56,104 --> 00:23:57,573
Thank you.
Thank you.

426
00:23:57,607 --> 00:23:59,543
I've taught him
everything I know.

427
00:23:59,578 --> 00:24:01,811
It's so important
that we prepare our youths

428
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:03,581
for the challenges
of the future.

429
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,747
Exactly.

430
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,089
Consider the advantage

431
00:24:06,126 --> 00:24:08,359
your son will have
over other Ferengi

432
00:24:08,398 --> 00:24:10,767
once he's learned
about other cultures...

433
00:24:10,803 --> 00:24:12,466
once he's learned
how others

434
00:24:12,507 --> 00:24:14,101
run their economies

435
00:24:14,144 --> 00:24:16,672
conduct business, negotiate...

436
00:24:16,716 --> 00:24:18,949
You will teach my son
these things?

437
00:24:18,988 --> 00:24:20,617
Knowledge is power, Mr. Rom.

438
00:24:20,658 --> 00:24:22,127
It can't work.

439
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:24,222
He will not listen to you.

440
00:24:24,266 --> 00:24:26,065
Why not?

441
00:24:26,103 --> 00:24:27,504
You are female.

442
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,667
So?

443
00:24:28,709 --> 00:24:32,376
My son cannot learn anything
from a female human teacher.

444
00:24:32,417 --> 00:24:33,886
Let him try it for a few weeks.

445
00:24:33,921 --> 00:24:36,894
He has nothing to lose
and so much to gain.

446
00:24:36,994 --> 00:24:38,520
I don't think so.

447
00:24:38,564 --> 00:24:40,762
Will you at least
think about it?

448
00:24:40,802 --> 00:24:42,135
Yes, yes, of course.

449
00:24:42,171 --> 00:24:43,834
Now, really, I'm quite busy.

450
00:24:43,876 --> 00:24:46,815
Place your wagers,
place your wagers.

451
00:24:46,849 --> 00:24:50,254
Get this lovely young woman
a drink.

452
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,919
What do we really
know about him anyway?

453
00:24:51,993 --> 00:24:53,360
He's not one of us.

454
00:24:53,397 --> 00:24:55,026
He isn't one of anything.

455
00:24:56,236 --> 00:24:57,899
You know what
really bothers me?

456
00:24:57,939 --> 00:25:00,342
This shifter was the
last Chief of Security

457
00:25:00,378 --> 00:25:02,109
when the Cardassians
were here.

458
00:25:02,149 --> 00:25:05,554
Yeah, he's the one
who caught Ibudan for them.

459
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,116
Why is he still Security Chief?

460
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,389
You're right.

461
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:11,426
We ought to talk to Major Kira.

462
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,805
Nobody knows him
like I know him.

463
00:25:13,841 --> 00:25:15,902
Let me tell you something.

464
00:25:15,979 --> 00:25:19,146
He's an ill-tempered,
overbearing crosspatch.

465
00:25:19,187 --> 00:25:21,681
But he was
no Cardassian collaborator

466
00:25:21,726 --> 00:25:23,286
and he's no killer.

467
00:25:23,329 --> 00:25:26,302
I can't believe
you're defending him, Quark.

468
00:25:26,335 --> 00:25:28,271
You're his worst enemy.

469
00:25:28,307 --> 00:25:30,072
Guess that's the closest thing

470
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:32,013
he has in this world
to a friend.

471
00:25:43,106 --> 00:25:45,099
Security, huh?

472
00:26:49,005 --> 00:26:51,169
Listen, I hear
what you're saying.

473
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,043
I understand your concerns.

474
00:26:53,081 --> 00:26:54,106
We're not saying whether

475
00:26:54,151 --> 00:26:55,620
he's innocent or guilty,
Commander.

476
00:26:55,653 --> 00:26:56,746
All we're saying...

477
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,726
Isn't it reasonable
under the circumstances...

478
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,095
Thank you very much for coming.

479
00:27:21,644 --> 00:27:23,375
Oh, this is wrong.

480
00:27:23,415 --> 00:27:25,943
And what would you
suggest we do?

481
00:27:25,987 --> 00:27:27,616
He didn't do it.

482
00:27:27,657 --> 00:27:29,992
The man we have in charge
of a murder investigation

483
00:27:30,029 --> 00:27:31,589
is the prime suspect, Major.

484
00:27:31,633 --> 00:27:33,729
Those people have
a right to complain.

485
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:35,900
Even if he's innocent

486
00:27:35,942 --> 00:27:37,639
it could still seem like

487
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,410
a conflict of interest, Kira.

488
00:27:40,452 --> 00:27:42,946
You're going to relieve him
of duty.

489
00:27:42,991 --> 00:27:44,858
I don't see any other choice.

490
00:27:44,895 --> 00:27:48,335
He has been completely candid
about this investigation.

491
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:51,639
He could have covered his tracks
half a dozen times already

492
00:27:51,677 --> 00:27:53,146
if he were guilty.

493
00:27:53,179 --> 00:27:55,673
I appreciate how you feel

494
00:27:55,718 --> 00:27:57,779
but the decision stands.

495
00:27:57,823 --> 00:27:59,725
I'll inform him myself.

496
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,976
The only curious thing I found
were these seofurance fragments

497
00:28:08,012 --> 00:28:09,481
near the matter
reclamation unit.

498
00:28:09,516 --> 00:28:10,506
Dish, please.

499
00:28:12,021 --> 00:28:14,960
It appears he was trying
to get rid of them.

500
00:28:14,995 --> 00:28:16,794
Do you have any idea
what they're from?

501
00:28:16,832 --> 00:28:18,165
I know exactly
what they're from.

502
00:28:18,201 --> 00:28:19,430
A biological sample container.

503
00:28:19,471 --> 00:28:21,270
I use them all the time.

504
00:28:21,308 --> 00:28:22,675
What would Ibudan be doing

505
00:28:22,712 --> 00:28:24,614
with a biological
sample container?

506
00:28:24,649 --> 00:28:25,844
Well, that I'm not so sure about

507
00:28:25,885 --> 00:28:27,184
but when I analyzed
the fragments

508
00:28:27,221 --> 00:28:30,319
I detected traces
of a complex organic structure.

509
00:28:30,362 --> 00:28:31,695
Translate, Doctor.

510
00:28:31,732 --> 00:28:33,999
It suggests Ibudan may
have been conducting

511
00:28:34,036 --> 00:28:37,134
some sort of medical
experiment on board his ship.

512
00:28:37,176 --> 00:28:39,443
He wasn't a doctor
or a scientist.

513
00:28:39,482 --> 00:28:41,509
Well, let's see what a standard

514
00:28:41,552 --> 00:28:43,887
electrophoretic analysis
tells us.

515
00:28:50,472 --> 00:28:51,907
What the?

516
00:28:51,942 --> 00:28:53,411
The complex proteins

517
00:28:53,446 --> 00:28:55,974
are breaking down
into DNA fragments.

518
00:28:56,018 --> 00:28:57,749
Now what does that mean?

519
00:28:57,855 --> 00:28:59,256
It means...

520
00:28:59,292 --> 00:29:01,695
we should set up
a bioregenerative field

521
00:29:01,731 --> 00:29:04,168
to accelerate
the cellular development.

522
00:29:04,203 --> 00:29:06,470
If I can reconstruct
the DNA sequence

523
00:29:06,507 --> 00:29:09,104
it might just give us
an idea what he was up to.

524
00:29:09,146 --> 00:29:10,445
Sisko to Odo.

525
00:29:10,483 --> 00:29:11,712
Here.

526
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,984
May I see you in my office,
please?

527
00:29:14,024 --> 00:29:15,357
Acknowledged.

528
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,242
Commander?

529
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,681
Sit down.

530
00:29:46,061 --> 00:29:48,897
I am temporarily
relieving you of duty.

531
00:29:48,934 --> 00:29:52,465
I'm sure the reasons
are obvious.

532
00:29:52,508 --> 00:29:55,811
Who will be taking over
the investigation?

533
00:29:55,882 --> 00:29:58,581
I've placed Major Kira
and Lieutenant Dax in charge.

534
00:30:02,197 --> 00:30:04,634
Will that be all, Commander?

535
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:07,470
I want you to know
I don't personally believe

536
00:30:07,508 --> 00:30:09,843
that you're responsible
for this.

537
00:30:09,947 --> 00:30:12,680
Really?

538
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,487
Now, how can that be true?

539
00:30:15,526 --> 00:30:18,089
You don't know me.

540
00:30:18,131 --> 00:30:21,332
You have no reason to believe
I wouldn't kill Ibudan

541
00:30:21,372 --> 00:30:22,864
if it suited my fancy.

542
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:26,883
So don't tell me there isn't
some doubt inside of you...

543
00:30:26,985 --> 00:30:29,286
some question
about whether or not

544
00:30:29,323 --> 00:30:31,088
I murdered the man.

545
00:30:31,127 --> 00:30:33,154
I simply feel
that putting Kira and Dax

546
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:34,827
in charge of the investigation

547
00:30:34,868 --> 00:30:36,701
will be in everyone's
best interest

548
00:30:36,739 --> 00:30:39,404
including your own.

549
00:30:39,445 --> 00:30:42,646
I'll take care
of my own best interests.

550
00:30:56,516 --> 00:30:58,145
That's him.

551
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:03,358
Yeah, they found his DNA...

552
00:31:39,276 --> 00:31:41,246
I can find out
who did it for you.

553
00:31:42,316 --> 00:31:43,785
Not for me.

554
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,551
Tell it to Starfleet.

555
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:48,289
I'm not in charge
here any longer.

556
00:31:48,329 --> 00:31:52,134
Well now, there's a piece
of good news to brighten my day.

557
00:31:52,172 --> 00:31:53,299
You better take advantage

558
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,934
of my absence while
you can, Quark.

559
00:31:54,977 --> 00:31:57,608
Oh, I will, I will.
Count on it.

560
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:00,646
I'll have every
confidence man in the sector

561
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:01,919
on board by tomorrow.

562
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,928
You do and I'll...

563
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:03,952
What?

564
00:32:03,997 --> 00:32:06,127
You're going to get sloppy

565
00:32:06,169 --> 00:32:08,470
without me to keep
an eye on you.

566
00:32:08,507 --> 00:32:10,136
I don't think so.

567
00:32:10,177 --> 00:32:13,412
You've kept me on my toes
for far too long now.

568
00:32:13,451 --> 00:32:15,080
Sure.

569
00:32:15,122 --> 00:32:18,095
I've turned you
into a better crook.

570
00:32:18,129 --> 00:32:19,723
Like it or not.

571
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,504
Quark, think you could use

572
00:32:26,547 --> 00:32:30,488
a shape-shifter
in your organization?

573
00:32:32,226 --> 00:32:34,891
Uh...

574
00:32:38,106 --> 00:32:39,700
You had me going.

575
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,509
I did, didn't I?

576
00:32:43,551 --> 00:32:45,077
Yes, you did.

577
00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:54,705
You know, I've been
asking some friends

578
00:32:54,742 --> 00:32:57,977
at Kran-Tobal Prison
about lbudan...

579
00:32:58,016 --> 00:33:01,889
whether he made any enemies
while he was there.

580
00:33:01,924 --> 00:33:03,621
Couldn't find any.

581
00:33:03,662 --> 00:33:06,897
Mostly he stayed around
the Bajoran dissidents

582
00:33:06,935 --> 00:33:09,702
that the Cardassians locked up.

583
00:33:23,941 --> 00:33:25,410
It's growing exponentially.

584
00:33:25,445 --> 00:33:28,646
We're going to have to increase
the metabolic field energy.

585
00:33:28,719 --> 00:33:30,952
Just what is it
that's growing in there?

586
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:33,086
Aren't those DNA patterns
humanoid, Julian?

587
00:33:33,128 --> 00:33:34,495
Well, that's what
it looks like to me

588
00:33:34,532 --> 00:33:38,233
but there's a genetic drift
I can't quite put my finger on.

589
00:33:38,273 --> 00:33:39,606
What was Ibudan up to?

590
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:41,112
We're going to have
to wait and see

591
00:33:41,145 --> 00:33:43,115
what this becomes
before we have a clue.

592
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:45,120
You can transfer it
to the larger field now.

593
00:33:45,154 --> 00:33:46,019
Yes, Doctor.

594
00:33:46,056 --> 00:33:47,355
Care for lunch?

595
00:33:47,393 --> 00:33:48,692
Sure.

596
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,029
No, thank you.

597
00:33:50,065 --> 00:33:52,366
Major Kira's waiting
for my report.

598
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:04,656
Just how many different lives
do you think she's led?

599
00:34:04,765 --> 00:34:06,234
I don't even know.

600
00:34:06,268 --> 00:34:10,539
He'll go... she'll go
through a list of them

601
00:34:10,577 --> 00:34:12,673
then out comes another one
in a later conversation.

602
00:34:12,748 --> 00:34:16,153
I'd guess that Jadzia
is probably the sixth host.

603
00:34:16,189 --> 00:34:17,157
Has she changed much?

604
00:34:17,192 --> 00:34:18,160
Changed?

605
00:34:18,194 --> 00:34:20,495
From the last one, Curzon Dax?

606
00:34:20,533 --> 00:34:23,995
I understand a Trill
integrates the personality

607
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,703
of each new host.

608
00:34:25,777 --> 00:34:28,510
I guess I'll have
to find that out.

609
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:31,648
If I were to tell you
some of the mischief

610
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:33,854
he and I used to get into...

611
00:34:33,895 --> 00:34:36,731
There was a time when
I was no older than you are

612
00:34:36,768 --> 00:34:40,732
we were attending the running
of the Rujian Steeplechase.

613
00:34:40,777 --> 00:34:42,337
Dax loves the races.

614
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,977
Anyway, there were
these gorgeous, seven-foot

615
00:34:45,019 --> 00:34:47,456
Ruji twin sisters
that Curzon knew.

616
00:34:47,491 --> 00:34:49,085
And he and I...

617
00:34:53,504 --> 00:34:58,106
I guess we won't be doing that
again soon, will we?

618
00:34:58,148 --> 00:35:00,118
You care for her
a great deal, don't you?

619
00:35:02,258 --> 00:35:04,923
Dax and I
are just friends, Doctor.

620
00:35:04,963 --> 00:35:06,694
If you're interested

621
00:35:06,734 --> 00:35:09,262
you have nothing to fear
from me.

622
00:35:09,306 --> 00:35:11,675
I mean,
if I were in your shoes

623
00:35:11,711 --> 00:35:14,478
knowing Dax
as intimately as you do

624
00:35:14,517 --> 00:35:17,353
I think I'd find her
hard to resist.

625
00:35:17,391 --> 00:35:19,452
You don't understand, Doctor.

626
00:35:19,495 --> 00:35:22,058
Dax used to beat me
regularly at bare fist

627
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,569
Juro Counterpunch.

628
00:35:23,604 --> 00:35:27,237
Well, I guess you won't be doing
that again soon either.

629
00:35:27,279 --> 00:35:29,306
Let's get out of here.

630
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:32,448
No, I'm not drinking
with scum.

631
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:34,153
I won't drink near this man.

632
00:35:34,194 --> 00:35:35,355
Come on, let's go.

633
00:35:50,329 --> 00:35:53,700
Yeah, in a semicircle here
facing the module.

634
00:35:53,737 --> 00:35:56,072
That's right.

635
00:35:56,109 --> 00:35:58,102
Thank you.

636
00:36:01,086 --> 00:36:02,578
Ah.

637
00:36:02,623 --> 00:36:04,092
Here's Mommy.

638
00:36:04,127 --> 00:36:06,257
Where have you been, Mommy?

639
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:08,096
I've been getting ready

640
00:36:08,136 --> 00:36:09,365
for school tomorrow, honey.

641
00:36:09,405 --> 00:36:10,373
Can I come to school?

642
00:36:10,407 --> 00:36:11,375
Oh, I wish you could.

643
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:13,847
At least then I'd know
one student would be coming.

644
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:16,649
But you have
to wait a year or two.

645
00:36:16,687 --> 00:36:17,916
How's it going?

646
00:36:17,956 --> 00:36:19,185
We'll be ready in time.

647
00:36:19,226 --> 00:36:20,820
In time for what, I'm not sure.

648
00:36:20,863 --> 00:36:22,423
Aside from Commander Sisko

649
00:36:22,467 --> 00:36:24,061
we haven't had
a firm commitment

650
00:36:24,104 --> 00:36:25,368
from any of the parents.

651
00:36:25,406 --> 00:36:26,705
What's this?

652
00:36:26,743 --> 00:36:28,736
Just a little something
I replicated

653
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:29,839
on the way over.

654
00:36:29,917 --> 00:36:31,682
Help Mommy to open
her present, Molly.

655
00:36:32,722 --> 00:36:34,487
Come on.

656
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:36,155
Yeah, go on.

657
00:36:36,197 --> 00:36:38,691
Pull.

658
00:36:38,735 --> 00:36:41,708
Oh, Miles.

659
00:36:43,613 --> 00:36:45,583
Thank you.

660
00:36:45,618 --> 00:36:47,588
I want to see you standing

661
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,251
in the Promenade
tomorrow morning

662
00:36:49,292 --> 00:36:51,456
ringing your school bell.

663
00:36:52,633 --> 00:36:55,230
Murderer!

664
00:36:55,272 --> 00:36:57,265
I better take her home.

665
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,848
Murderer!

666
00:36:59,883 --> 00:37:00,851
Killer!

667
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,981
Don't you know
you're not wanted?

668
00:37:03,022 --> 00:37:04,457
There he is. Get him.

669
00:37:04,492 --> 00:37:05,791
You don't belong...

670
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:07,696
Murderer!
Shape-shifting freak!

671
00:37:19,225 --> 00:37:20,694
Murderer!

672
00:37:20,728 --> 00:37:22,664
O'Brien to Ops.

673
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:25,432
Security to the Promenade,
on the double.

674
00:37:25,471 --> 00:37:26,940
Acknowledged.

675
00:37:27,944 --> 00:37:29,743
Yes, sir.

676
00:37:29,782 --> 00:37:31,411
O'Brien to Sisko.

677
00:37:31,452 --> 00:37:32,921
I'm here, Chief.

678
00:37:32,955 --> 00:37:34,584
What's going on?

679
00:37:34,625 --> 00:37:36,823
We've got a crowd...
more like a mob...

680
00:37:36,863 --> 00:37:38,162
outside Odo's office.

681
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,467
You better get down here.

682
00:38:10,103 --> 00:38:13,406
Freak!
Shape-shifter!

683
00:38:13,444 --> 00:38:14,708
Freak!

684
00:38:14,746 --> 00:38:16,443
Shape-shifter!

685
00:38:16,483 --> 00:38:18,453
Murdering shifter!

686
00:38:18,488 --> 00:38:20,652
Shape-shifter!

687
00:38:22,998 --> 00:38:24,558
Odo's inside?

688
00:38:24,601 --> 00:38:26,366
Yes, sir. He went in
a few minutes ago.

689
00:38:26,405 --> 00:38:27,965
The crowd followed him
from the bar.

690
00:38:28,076 --> 00:38:29,978
I want more security here,
and I want them armed.

691
00:38:30,014 --> 00:38:31,073
Aye, sir.

692
00:38:31,116 --> 00:38:32,483
It's going to be harder
to control them

693
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:33,509
if the numbers keep growing.

694
00:38:33,555 --> 00:38:34,648
We can secure all turbolifts...

695
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,159
slow down the traffic
onto the Promenade.

696
00:38:36,194 --> 00:38:38,427
Good idea.

697
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:50,017
Julian, look at this.

698
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:53,121
The chromatin pattern's
changing.

699
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,861
It's definitely humanoid.

700
00:38:54,902 --> 00:38:57,373
It's definitely
humanoid.

701
00:38:59,645 --> 00:39:03,814
It's definitely...
My God!

702
00:39:03,854 --> 00:39:05,483
Dax, I think I know what it is.

703
00:39:05,525 --> 00:39:07,461
Run a chromosome analysis.

704
00:39:07,496 --> 00:39:10,059
I think we're going to find
a gene-sequence degradation.

705
00:39:20,802 --> 00:39:23,399
Shifter! Shifter!

706
00:39:23,441 --> 00:39:24,409
Shifter!

707
00:39:24,443 --> 00:39:29,182
Shifter! Shifter! Shifter!

708
00:39:31,391 --> 00:39:33,122
Coming through.

709
00:39:37,672 --> 00:39:40,975
What the hell do you people
intend to accomplish here?

710
00:39:41,013 --> 00:39:42,539
We want the shape-shifter.

711
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:43,882
And what do you think

712
00:39:43,919 --> 00:39:46,049
you're going to do to him
if you get to him?

713
00:39:46,091 --> 00:39:47,184
He deserves to die.

714
00:39:47,226 --> 00:39:48,216
'Bout time!

715
00:39:48,262 --> 00:39:49,629
He's right!

716
00:39:51,904 --> 00:39:52,872
How do you get a rope

717
00:39:52,906 --> 00:39:54,375
around the neck
of a shape-shifter?

718
00:39:55,411 --> 00:39:56,504
Listen to me.

719
00:39:56,547 --> 00:39:58,984
You will disperse immediately.

720
00:39:59,019 --> 00:40:00,613
Return to your quarters.

721
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:02,215
Return to your ships.

722
00:40:14,253 --> 00:40:16,520
He's a murderer.

723
00:40:16,557 --> 00:40:18,390
We want justice.

724
00:40:18,429 --> 00:40:19,658
Do you?

725
00:40:19,731 --> 00:40:21,633
Justice?

726
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,002
Really?

727
00:40:23,038 --> 00:40:24,803
Is it justice you're after

728
00:40:24,842 --> 00:40:28,874
or just some way to express
your anger, your fear?

729
00:40:28,918 --> 00:40:30,615
Look at yourselves.

730
00:40:30,655 --> 00:40:34,151
In an hour, you'll regret
what you tried to do here.

731
00:40:34,197 --> 00:40:35,530
Do not condemn this man

732
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:37,696
because he is different
than you are.

733
00:40:37,804 --> 00:40:41,209
We condemn him because
of the evidence.

734
00:40:41,245 --> 00:40:42,805
Yeah!

735
00:40:42,849 --> 00:40:45,480
Then take that evidence
to a court of law.

736
00:40:45,521 --> 00:40:47,992
There will be no justice
served here today.

737
00:40:48,027 --> 00:40:48,995
Commander!

738
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:50,464
Commander Sisko,
I believe we have

739
00:40:50,499 --> 00:40:52,629
some new evidence to consider.

740
00:40:52,671 --> 00:40:54,972
The man who was murdered
was not Ibudan.

741
00:40:55,008 --> 00:40:56,375
What?!

742
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,109
Come with me.

743
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,459
All right, break it up now.

744
00:41:04,496 --> 00:41:05,464
Move on, people.

745
00:41:05,498 --> 00:41:06,591
Let's clear the area.

746
00:41:06,634 --> 00:41:08,103
You heard what she said.
Let's go.

747
00:41:08,137 --> 00:41:09,504
Come on.
Back to your quarters.

748
00:41:09,541 --> 00:41:10,566
Quickly. Move!

749
00:41:10,743 --> 00:41:12,235
A clone.

750
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,717
That's what Ibudan
was working on.

751
00:41:14,785 --> 00:41:16,881
Creating a clone of himself.

752
00:41:16,924 --> 00:41:18,553
And then he killed the clone

753
00:41:18,594 --> 00:41:20,963
to frame me for his murder.

754
00:41:20,999 --> 00:41:24,063
How can we be sure
the victim was a clone?

755
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:26,577
A clone has identical DNA
to that of the donor

756
00:41:26,611 --> 00:41:28,376
but certain cloning
methods cause

757
00:41:28,416 --> 00:41:31,856
a characteristic
gene-sequence degradation

758
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:33,655
which can be detected.

759
00:41:33,694 --> 00:41:34,993
If you know to look for it.

760
00:41:35,029 --> 00:41:36,931
We've matched
the victim's gene sequence

761
00:41:36,968 --> 00:41:38,938
with the fellow in the jar here.

762
00:41:38,972 --> 00:41:40,498
They're definitely both clones.

763
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:42,011
And what happens to this one?

764
00:41:42,045 --> 00:41:43,274
In about two days

765
00:41:43,314 --> 00:41:45,444
he becomes a living,
breathing member

766
00:41:45,486 --> 00:41:47,115
of Bajoran society.

767
00:41:47,157 --> 00:41:50,061
Let's hope he doesn't follow
in his donor's footsteps.

768
00:41:50,097 --> 00:41:52,033
What about Ibudan?

769
00:41:54,238 --> 00:41:56,903
I have an idea
where to find him.

770
00:42:04,695 --> 00:42:07,064
Computer, lights.

771
00:42:15,853 --> 00:42:17,789
Who are you?

772
00:42:17,891 --> 00:42:19,052
How did you get in here?

773
00:42:19,093 --> 00:42:20,995
Oh, I think you know.

774
00:42:21,031 --> 00:42:23,525
I warn you,
I'll call Ship Security.

775
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:25,199
Do that.

776
00:42:25,241 --> 00:42:28,214
I have some interesting
questions to ask them.

777
00:42:28,247 --> 00:42:30,480
For example, I'm especially
curious to know

778
00:42:30,518 --> 00:42:31,713
how the name Lamonay S.

779
00:42:31,754 --> 00:42:35,194
Came to appear on this ship's
passenger list yesterday.

780
00:42:35,229 --> 00:42:36,664
That is my name

781
00:42:36,698 --> 00:42:38,725
and I arranged transport
on this vessel.

782
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:40,831
Why should that be so strange?

783
00:42:40,941 --> 00:42:43,845
You did not arrive on this ship.

784
00:42:43,948 --> 00:42:45,747
No.

785
00:42:45,785 --> 00:42:49,088
Well, just what ship did you
arrive on, Mr. Lamonay S?

786
00:42:49,126 --> 00:42:50,857
I can't find any record
of your arrival

787
00:42:50,963 --> 00:42:53,764
on any vessel that has docked
here in the last three weeks.

788
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:58,441
I assure you, you are in error.

789
00:42:58,479 --> 00:43:00,746
In fact, I think you
did arrive on this ship

790
00:43:00,785 --> 00:43:02,652
and that you spent
the last few years

791
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:04,455
in a prison among
Bajoran dissidents.

792
00:43:04,493 --> 00:43:06,429
One of whom I've
learned was a scientist

793
00:43:06,464 --> 00:43:08,161
who was arrested
by the Cardassians

794
00:43:08,201 --> 00:43:09,966
for conducting
experimental research

795
00:43:10,005 --> 00:43:11,234
into tri-phasic cloning.

796
00:43:18,523 --> 00:43:22,224
Killing your own clone
is still murder.

797
00:43:22,265 --> 00:43:26,867
Commander's Log,
Stardate 46421.5.

798
00:43:26,976 --> 00:43:29,413
Ibudan has been turned over
to the Bajoran authorities

799
00:43:29,448 --> 00:43:31,384
just hours after his clone
gained consciousness

800
00:43:31,419 --> 00:43:33,252
and began a new life.

801
00:43:33,289 --> 00:43:34,883
The perpetrators
of the mob violence

802
00:43:34,993 --> 00:43:36,895
have retreated
into their own business.

803
00:43:36,965 --> 00:43:40,370
To my knowledge,
Odo has received no apologies.

804
00:43:40,406 --> 00:43:43,504
Meanwhile, life on the station
has begun to return to normal.

805
00:43:43,545 --> 00:43:45,447
Computer, what time is it?

806
00:43:45,483 --> 00:43:48,011
0907 hours.

807
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:51,796
I guess you were right.

808
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:53,459
It isn't going to be easy.

809
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,527
Maybe it's just going
to take a little time...

810
00:43:55,572 --> 00:43:58,511
Sit down!

811
00:43:58,545 --> 00:44:00,515
Not next to that human boy.

812
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:03,887
I don't want you to have
anything to do with him.

813
00:44:06,396 --> 00:44:09,995
We'll... try it
for a few weeks.

814
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,656
Please come in.

815
00:44:19,692 --> 00:44:21,822
Uh, take any seat.

816
00:44:21,863 --> 00:44:23,765
Try to be on time from now on.

817
00:44:23,801 --> 00:44:25,464
My name is Keiko O'Brien.

818
00:44:25,505 --> 00:44:26,906
I'll be your teacher.

819
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,343
Why don't we turn
on our computers

820
00:44:29,379 --> 00:44:32,682
and access the files on Bajor
to find out a little bit more

821
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,157
about the people and
history of this world.
