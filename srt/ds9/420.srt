1
00:00:16,231 --> 00:00:18,532
Enjoying the view?

2
00:00:18,569 --> 00:00:21,201
Uh, I'm stuck on this new story
I'm working on

3
00:00:21,243 --> 00:00:22,872
and coming here helps me...

4
00:00:22,913 --> 00:00:25,214
No need to explain, Mr. Sisko.

5
00:00:26,255 --> 00:00:27,383
I just...

6
00:00:27,424 --> 00:00:28,916
thought...

7
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:31,727
You just thought what?

8
00:00:33,806 --> 00:00:35,777
I thought you were going
to ask me to leave.

9
00:00:37,214 --> 00:00:38,843
Why would I do that?

10
00:00:38,884 --> 00:00:40,752
You always used
to chase me away.

11
00:00:40,789 --> 00:00:42,224
I never chased you away.

12
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:43,922
I chased Nog.

13
00:00:43,963 --> 00:00:45,660
You just happened
to be with him.

14
00:00:45,701 --> 00:00:47,261
So, unless you're planning

15
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:50,106
on flicking sand peas
at the passing throng

16
00:00:50,145 --> 00:00:52,947
you're welcome to stay here
as long as you like.

17
00:00:52,985 --> 00:00:55,753
I don't have any sand peas.

18
00:00:58,999 --> 00:01:00,799
You miss him, don't you?

19
00:01:01,773 --> 00:01:03,903
Nog?

20
00:01:03,944 --> 00:01:05,243
Maybe a little.

21
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:06,750
A little!

22
00:01:06,785 --> 00:01:08,983
There isn't a day goes by

23
00:01:09,023 --> 00:01:12,794
that I don't see him
standing here, pining away

24
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:14,997
for that no-good
nephew of mine.

25
00:01:15,038 --> 00:01:16,371
I'm not here every day.

26
00:01:16,408 --> 00:01:17,376
No...

27
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,711
just four or five times a week.

28
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:21,514
If you ask me,
Nog should never

29
00:01:21,554 --> 00:01:22,716
have gone off to the Academy.

30
00:01:22,757 --> 00:01:25,559
You lost a friend
and I lost a good waiter.

31
00:01:25,597 --> 00:01:26,565
Nog will be back

32
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:28,570
and he'll be wearing
a Starfleet uniform.

33
00:01:28,604 --> 00:01:30,096
I'm proud of what he's doing.

34
00:01:30,141 --> 00:01:31,906
Remember that
the next time you try

35
00:01:31,946 --> 00:01:33,438
and play dom-jot by yourself.

36
00:01:34,518 --> 00:01:36,112
You don't want me
hanging around here?

37
00:01:36,155 --> 00:01:38,684
Fine. I'll do my thinking
someplace else.

38
00:01:42,403 --> 00:01:44,203
Poor kid.

39
00:01:44,242 --> 00:01:46,976
I suppose that's what you
get for having friends.

40
00:01:47,015 --> 00:01:48,040
Meaning what?

41
00:01:48,084 --> 00:01:50,613
Just that when you think
you can count on them

42
00:01:50,657 --> 00:01:52,126
they go off and leave you.

43
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,928
No. You're much
better off without them.

44
00:01:54,967 --> 00:01:57,370
I imagine that's why you
don't have any friends.

45
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,533
Look who's talking.

46
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,372
Dad, I'm home.

47
00:02:24,738 --> 00:02:26,002
Mom?

48
00:04:27,425 --> 00:04:30,866
I'm afraid
I'm not your mother, Jake.

49
00:04:30,901 --> 00:04:33,304
This is the woman
I told you about...

50
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:35,367
the one I met
in the parallel universe.

51
00:04:36,413 --> 00:04:38,007
So...

52
00:04:38,051 --> 00:04:41,218
you're Jennifer Sisko,
but you're just not my mom.

53
00:04:41,258 --> 00:04:42,727
That's right.

54
00:04:44,132 --> 00:04:46,035
You look exactly like her.

55
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,699
And I was married to a man

56
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,406
who looked exactly
like your father.

57
00:04:50,447 --> 00:04:52,384
It's all a little confusing,
isn't it?

58
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:53,581
More than a little.

59
00:04:53,621 --> 00:04:54,851
Did you tell her?

60
00:04:54,891 --> 00:04:56,053
Tell her what?

61
00:04:56,094 --> 00:04:57,620
Ever since my dad
told me about you

62
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:58,997
I've been wanting to meet you.

63
00:04:59,034 --> 00:05:00,024
Well...

64
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,071
here I am.

65
00:05:03,111 --> 00:05:05,913
You even sound like my mother.

66
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:07,079
Ops to Captain Sisko.

67
00:05:07,187 --> 00:05:08,349
Go ahead.

68
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,861
Minister Gettor's shuttle
has docked.

69
00:05:10,896 --> 00:05:12,992
Give me a few minutes.

70
00:05:13,035 --> 00:05:14,698
Offer him a tour of the station.

71
00:05:14,739 --> 00:05:16,038
I already have.

72
00:05:16,075 --> 00:05:18,546
His time here is limited
and he's anxious

73
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:20,381
to meet with the Emissary.

74
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:22,617
I'll be right there.

75
00:05:22,658 --> 00:05:24,025
So, why are you here?

76
00:05:24,061 --> 00:05:25,826
I came here to see your father.

77
00:05:25,866 --> 00:05:27,062
Really?

78
00:05:27,101 --> 00:05:29,004
That's great.

79
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,943
Jennifer came
to give me some good news.

80
00:05:30,978 --> 00:05:32,972
The Terrans have won
an important victory.

81
00:05:33,016 --> 00:05:35,887
We've driven the Alliance
off of the space station.

82
00:05:35,923 --> 00:05:38,794
Then the rebels
control Terok Nor.

83
00:05:39,865 --> 00:05:42,633
I see your father
has told you all about us.

84
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:47,107
Well, I guess I better
get to my meeting.

85
00:05:47,149 --> 00:05:48,311
I understand.

86
00:05:48,353 --> 00:05:51,121
It's not like you
were expecting me.

87
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:54,132
You're not leaving, are you?

88
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:58,039
Is it all right if I visit
with Jake for a while?

89
00:05:58,076 --> 00:06:00,343
I don't think Jake would have it
any other way.

90
00:06:00,382 --> 00:06:03,686
Maybe the three of us
can have dinner together.

91
00:06:03,722 --> 00:06:05,989
The depends on how long
my meeting lasts.

92
00:06:06,028 --> 00:06:08,499
We'll wait.

93
00:06:10,138 --> 00:06:11,471
Okay.

94
00:06:20,496 --> 00:06:22,899
Uh, would you like
another <i>raktajino?</i>

95
00:06:23,503 --> 00:06:25,200
Thank you.

96
00:06:25,241 --> 00:06:27,371
That would be nice.

97
00:06:27,413 --> 00:06:29,475
That's amazing.

98
00:06:29,518 --> 00:06:31,386
What?

99
00:06:31,422 --> 00:06:33,689
I never thought
I'd hold these hands again.

100
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,221
They feel just like my mother's.

101
00:06:40,211 --> 00:06:42,182
Um...

102
00:06:42,215 --> 00:06:45,211
I... I'll get you
that <i>raktajino.</i>

103
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,170
Well, that went well.

104
00:07:05,203 --> 00:07:07,504
I think you made it clear
to the Minister

105
00:07:07,543 --> 00:07:10,516
why the Emissary can't endorse
his land reform program.

106
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,521
It only took three hours.

107
00:07:12,555 --> 00:07:15,859
If you like, we can go over
the weekly personnel reports.

108
00:07:15,895 --> 00:07:17,194
In the morning.

109
00:07:17,232 --> 00:07:20,103
I have someone waiting for me
in my quarters.

110
00:07:23,747 --> 00:07:25,011
Jake!

111
00:07:25,051 --> 00:07:26,384
Jennifer.

112
00:07:30,263 --> 00:07:33,567
Computer, locate Jake Sisko.

113
00:07:33,605 --> 00:07:36,669
Jake Sisko
is not on the station.

114
00:07:55,056 --> 00:07:56,457
Are you sure this is
what Smiley used

115
00:07:56,493 --> 00:07:58,190
to transport you
to the alternate universe?

116
00:07:58,231 --> 00:07:59,221
Looks like it.

117
00:07:59,266 --> 00:08:01,237
And you're convinced
Jake's gone over there?

118
00:08:01,271 --> 00:08:03,606
He's not on the station
and neither is Jennifer.

119
00:08:03,643 --> 00:08:06,445
Maybe he convinced her to take
him over there for a visit.

120
00:08:06,483 --> 00:08:07,782
Without asking me?

121
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,420
It could be she left that behind
as an invitation to join them.

122
00:08:12,431 --> 00:08:14,162
And I accept...

123
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:17,334
but only to get Jake back.

124
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:18,503
Want some company?

125
00:08:18,546 --> 00:08:21,017
I can think of safer
places to visit.

126
00:08:21,051 --> 00:08:23,717
Major, you and the Chief
come with me.

127
00:08:23,758 --> 00:08:25,318
Commander, you have Ops.

128
00:08:29,205 --> 00:08:30,640
Expecting trouble, Major?

129
00:08:30,675 --> 00:08:32,805
Just want to be prepared.

130
00:08:41,032 --> 00:08:42,695
Energize.

131
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:59,342
Welcome back, Captain.

132
00:08:59,377 --> 00:09:00,436
What happened to the others?

133
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,379
They weren't invited.

134
00:09:01,482 --> 00:09:02,381
Where's my son?

135
00:09:02,484 --> 00:09:03,474
He's with Professor Sisko.

136
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,819
She's showing him the station.

137
00:09:04,857 --> 00:09:05,825
The tour's over.

138
00:09:05,859 --> 00:09:07,123
I'm taking Jake home.

139
00:09:07,162 --> 00:09:08,495
Then I'm afraid
we have a problem.

140
00:09:08,532 --> 00:09:09,831
What kind of problem?

141
00:09:09,869 --> 00:09:11,566
Jake's not going anywhere...

142
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:14,703
and neither are you.

143
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,668
Terok Nor in rebel hands...

144
00:09:24,704 --> 00:09:26,698
it just shows
what people can do

145
00:09:26,742 --> 00:09:28,371
when their cause is just.

146
00:09:28,413 --> 00:09:29,814
Save the speeches, Smiley.

147
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,914
Right now, I don't care
too much for you or your cause.

148
00:09:32,957 --> 00:09:34,791
You've every right to be angry.

149
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:36,891
We haven't exactly
played fair with you.

150
00:09:36,934 --> 00:09:38,597
You kidnapped my son.

151
00:09:38,638 --> 00:09:39,971
Kidnapped?

152
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,479
An ugly word.

153
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,479
But accurate.

154
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,143
Tell me, Captain.

155
00:09:45,186 --> 00:09:46,883
If we had come and asked
for your help

156
00:09:46,925 --> 00:09:49,294
in fighting the Alliance,
what would you have said?

157
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,492
I'd have said no.

158
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,594
Which is why we had
to use your son

159
00:09:52,638 --> 00:09:53,971
to lure you over here.

160
00:09:55,979 --> 00:09:57,642
We need your help, Captain.

161
00:09:58,886 --> 00:10:00,914
No one else will do.

162
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,484
Recognize her?

163
00:10:03,864 --> 00:10:05,629
Ah...

164
00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:07,070
The <i>Defiant.</i>

165
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,738
During our last encounter.
When I visited your station

166
00:10:09,778 --> 00:10:11,179
I took a moment

167
00:10:11,216 --> 00:10:14,018
to download as many of your
computer files as I could.

168
00:10:14,055 --> 00:10:16,117
I figured they'd come
in handy someday

169
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,322
and they have.

170
00:10:17,364 --> 00:10:20,166
You see, Captain, taking
Terok Nor was one thing.

171
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:22,437
Keeping it,
that's the tricky part.

172
00:10:22,476 --> 00:10:24,310
The Alliance fleet
is already on its way.

173
00:10:24,347 --> 00:10:25,406
When they get here

174
00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:27,579
I want to have a proper
welcome ready for them.

175
00:10:27,654 --> 00:10:29,557
These schematics look complete.

176
00:10:29,593 --> 00:10:30,755
Why do you need me?

177
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,926
If you want to build
another <i>Defiant</i>

178
00:10:32,968 --> 00:10:34,460
why do you need my help?

179
00:10:34,505 --> 00:10:35,997
We've already built it.

180
00:10:36,042 --> 00:10:38,513
The problem is, when we
power up its engines

181
00:10:38,548 --> 00:10:41,077
the whole ship damn near
shakes itself apart.

182
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,248
We had the same trouble.

183
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,280
It's a powerful ship.

184
00:10:43,325 --> 00:10:44,315
Well, right now, it's

185
00:10:44,362 --> 00:10:46,994
a little too powerful
for its own good.

186
00:10:47,035 --> 00:10:48,163
How did you solve it?

187
00:10:48,204 --> 00:10:49,172
We had to overhaul

188
00:10:49,207 --> 00:10:51,144
the structural integrity
field grids.

189
00:10:51,178 --> 00:10:53,274
How long did it take?

190
00:10:53,316 --> 00:10:54,751
Two weeks.

191
00:10:54,786 --> 00:10:56,312
We have four days.

192
00:10:56,357 --> 00:10:57,883
I'm not sure that's enough time.

193
00:10:57,928 --> 00:10:59,056
It had better be.

194
00:10:59,097 --> 00:11:01,091
Otherwise, the <i>Defiant</i>
won't be ready

195
00:11:01,135 --> 00:11:02,695
and you and your son
will die here

196
00:11:02,739 --> 00:11:04,710
along with the rest of us.

197
00:11:04,743 --> 00:11:07,146
Or worse still...
spend the rest of your lives

198
00:11:07,183 --> 00:11:09,313
working in the ore
processing center

199
00:11:09,355 --> 00:11:12,328
under the tender mercies
of an Alliance overseer.

200
00:11:13,732 --> 00:11:15,201
Help us, Captain

201
00:11:15,236 --> 00:11:18,437
and I promise we'll get you
and your son out of here

202
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:20,174
before the fireworks begin.

203
00:11:20,214 --> 00:11:23,450
The <i>Defiant</i> is
at Docking Port 5.

204
00:11:23,489 --> 00:11:24,753
I think you know the way.

205
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,921
I want to see my son first.

206
00:11:26,963 --> 00:11:28,398
I knew you would.

207
00:11:33,445 --> 00:11:34,846
Is he with us?

208
00:11:34,882 --> 00:11:36,181
You remember

209
00:11:36,219 --> 00:11:37,187
Captain Bashir.

210
00:11:37,222 --> 00:11:38,384
Captain?

211
00:11:38,424 --> 00:11:40,895
Captain Bashir. Captain O'Brien.
Captain Sisko.

212
00:11:40,931 --> 00:11:43,402
We may not have
enough troops or ships

213
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:46,102
or weapons, but we have
plenty of Captains.

214
00:11:46,143 --> 00:11:48,410
Is he going to help us or not?!

215
00:11:48,448 --> 00:11:51,752
You must have missed
that cheery face, hmm?

216
00:11:53,761 --> 00:11:55,891
Relax.

217
00:11:55,933 --> 00:11:58,200
The Captain has found it
in his heart

218
00:11:58,239 --> 00:11:59,572
to aid us once again.

219
00:12:00,577 --> 00:12:01,841
Good.

220
00:12:05,556 --> 00:12:07,424
I owed you that.

221
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:08,589
I let you hit me once

222
00:12:08,631 --> 00:12:11,034
because I thought you were
our Captain Sisko.

223
00:12:11,069 --> 00:12:12,869
Now I know better.

224
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,978
We're even now.

225
00:12:22,263 --> 00:12:24,757
If I were you,
I'd keep out of his way.

226
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,408
You and I friends?

227
00:12:28,444 --> 00:12:30,540
I don't think so.

228
00:12:30,582 --> 00:12:31,710
Why not?

229
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:33,051
You're too tall.

230
00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:34,558
I don't trust tall men.

231
00:12:34,592 --> 00:12:36,495
Tall women...

232
00:12:36,531 --> 00:12:39,095
ah... that's a different story.

233
00:12:39,136 --> 00:12:40,104
Here.

234
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:41,733
See for yourself.

235
00:12:43,781 --> 00:12:46,481
Jake, isn't she
a little old for you?

236
00:12:46,521 --> 00:12:47,615
Who are you?
His mother?

237
00:12:48,593 --> 00:12:49,583
Jake!

238
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:53,030
Dad.

239
00:12:56,177 --> 00:12:58,114
I'm-I'm sorry.

240
00:12:58,149 --> 00:12:59,410
But I had to come.

241
00:12:59,543 --> 00:13:01,514
Somehow, talking to Jennifer

242
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:04,180
telling her all
about the past nine years...

243
00:13:04,221 --> 00:13:06,192
about all the things
that happened to me

244
00:13:06,226 --> 00:13:08,527
what I've done, what
I've been thinking about...

245
00:13:08,632 --> 00:13:09,862
it's like telling Mom.

246
00:13:09,901 --> 00:13:12,635
In a lot of ways,
she's nothing like your mom.

247
00:13:12,674 --> 00:13:15,978
Yeah, but in some ways,
she's just like her.

248
00:13:16,016 --> 00:13:17,542
And not just physically.

249
00:13:17,653 --> 00:13:20,182
She listens like Mom.

250
00:13:20,226 --> 00:13:22,755
And it's the exact same smile.

251
00:13:22,798 --> 00:13:24,131
Okay, Jake.

252
00:13:24,168 --> 00:13:26,662
This place is unbelievable.

253
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:29,442
Chief O'Brien, Dr. Bashir, Dax...
they're all here.

254
00:13:29,482 --> 00:13:32,854
I mean, I know it's not
really them, but... look.

255
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:34,290
Here's Nog.

256
00:13:34,326 --> 00:13:35,454
This is my father.

257
00:13:35,496 --> 00:13:36,795
He's tall, too.

258
00:13:36,832 --> 00:13:38,769
Look, Jake-o

259
00:13:38,804 --> 00:13:40,775
I have to talk to Jennifer
alone for a minute.

260
00:13:40,809 --> 00:13:42,108
She likes you.

261
00:13:42,145 --> 00:13:44,582
Jake, whatever you're thinking...

262
00:13:44,618 --> 00:13:46,919
whatever plans you're making...

263
00:13:46,957 --> 00:13:48,119
forget about them.

264
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,393
I'm not making any plans.

265
00:13:53,172 --> 00:13:54,607
Outside.

266
00:14:02,461 --> 00:14:04,158
I just want to know one thing...

267
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:05,827
whose idea was this?

268
00:14:05,869 --> 00:14:06,859
Does it matter?

269
00:14:06,904 --> 00:14:08,339
It does to me.

270
00:14:09,343 --> 00:14:10,333
It was mine.

271
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,410
We needed you to help us
complete the ship.

272
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,287
Smiley told me all about you

273
00:14:15,325 --> 00:14:18,822
about your wife's death,
about your son.

274
00:14:18,867 --> 00:14:20,861
I knew that Jake
would want to meet me...

275
00:14:20,905 --> 00:14:22,636
that I'd remind him
of his mother.

276
00:14:22,676 --> 00:14:25,079
You're nothing like his mother.

277
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,777
I think Jake would disagree.

278
00:14:26,819 --> 00:14:28,288
Of course, he would.

279
00:14:28,322 --> 00:14:31,159
In his mind, the three of us
are already living together.

280
00:14:31,196 --> 00:14:34,534
Ben, you're the one that
convinced me to join the rebels

281
00:14:34,571 --> 00:14:36,371
to fight the good fight
for my people.

282
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:38,504
It's not your cause
that I have a problem with.

283
00:14:38,547 --> 00:14:39,675
It's your methods.

284
00:14:39,717 --> 00:14:42,588
I'm sorry if Jake's feelings
get hurt

285
00:14:42,623 --> 00:14:44,651
but that's a small price to pay

286
00:14:44,695 --> 00:14:46,529
if it means success
against the Alliance.

287
00:14:46,566 --> 00:14:50,098
All right, I'm here
and I'm going to help you

288
00:14:50,141 --> 00:14:53,239
but I want you
to leave my son alone.

289
00:14:54,251 --> 00:14:55,481
- I can't.
- Why not?

290
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:56,683
Jennifer.

291
00:15:01,703 --> 00:15:04,335
Because he won't leave me alone.

292
00:15:36,285 --> 00:15:38,483
Bow before the Regent!

293
00:15:38,524 --> 00:15:42,626
I can't think of anything
I'd rather do.

294
00:15:46,978 --> 00:15:50,248
Ah, so this is the <i>p'tak</i>

295
00:15:50,286 --> 00:15:52,780
who lost Terok Nor
to the rebels.

296
00:15:52,892 --> 00:15:53,986
That's not exactly...

297
00:15:55,197 --> 00:15:57,293
Are you calling me a liar?

298
00:16:03,784 --> 00:16:05,413
I was merely observing

299
00:16:05,455 --> 00:16:08,587
that as one of many officers
under the Intendant's command

300
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:10,429
it would be an overstatement

301
00:16:10,467 --> 00:16:15,377
to imply that I, alone,
was responsible for our defeat.

302
00:16:15,413 --> 00:16:18,614
But you are the only officer
who managed to escape.

303
00:16:18,653 --> 00:16:21,182
Perhaps I should have
surrendered to the rebels...

304
00:16:21,226 --> 00:16:24,462
groveling on the floor,
begging for my life

305
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,026
like the Intendant.

306
00:16:26,072 --> 00:16:29,102
You are attempting to shift
the blame away from yourself.

307
00:16:29,145 --> 00:16:30,876
Am I succeeding?

308
00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:36,825
This time, I will deal
with the rebels myself.

309
00:16:36,931 --> 00:16:40,337
You will be at my side,
redeeming yourself in battle.

310
00:16:40,373 --> 00:16:41,535
Your fairness

311
00:16:41,575 --> 00:16:44,139
and good judgment are everything
I've heard them to be.

312
00:16:44,181 --> 00:16:45,582
Believe me, my Regent

313
00:16:45,618 --> 00:16:48,089
it will take the blood
of many rebels

314
00:16:48,124 --> 00:16:51,063
to quench the thirst
of my revenge.

315
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,000
Spoken like a Klingon.

316
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:55,633
I'm trying.

317
00:16:55,675 --> 00:17:01,315
Now, if you could just remove
this insufferable collar...

318
00:17:01,356 --> 00:17:04,728
No, the collar stays
until every rebel on Terok Nor

319
00:17:04,764 --> 00:17:06,826
lies dead at my feet.

320
00:17:32,598 --> 00:17:34,158
Sisko to Smiley.

321
00:17:34,201 --> 00:17:36,730
I'm about to put the deuterium
injector back on-line.

322
00:17:36,773 --> 00:17:37,867
Go ahead.

323
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,539
I've got the flow regulators
shut off.

324
00:17:41,318 --> 00:17:43,255
Injectors are operational.

325
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,261
You can recalibrate
the regulators now.

326
00:17:45,294 --> 00:17:46,284
Will do.

327
00:17:49,137 --> 00:17:50,834
I heard you were back.

328
00:17:52,545 --> 00:17:54,880
That's for making love
to me under false pretenses.

329
00:17:54,918 --> 00:17:56,946
I was suspicious
of you from the start.

330
00:17:56,989 --> 00:17:57,957
You hid it well.

331
00:17:57,991 --> 00:18:00,155
If you ever touch me again...

332
00:18:01,098 --> 00:18:02,294
Do you get my point?

333
00:18:02,335 --> 00:18:03,770
I hope not.

334
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:12,318
What happened?

335
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:16,563
Ah... you remember the Intendant,
don't you?

336
00:18:16,603 --> 00:18:18,699
I was taking her
to an interrogation session

337
00:18:18,741 --> 00:18:20,974
when the vile little tyrant
tried to escape.

338
00:18:22,985 --> 00:18:23,953
Oops.

339
00:18:23,987 --> 00:18:25,684
- Pick her up.
- Leave her!

340
00:18:25,725 --> 00:18:28,060
She's not through
with her lesson.

341
00:18:29,634 --> 00:18:32,105
If this is supposed
to teach me a lesson

342
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:35,113
you might want to turn
that little toy of yours

343
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,480
to a higher setting.

344
00:18:38,221 --> 00:18:40,215
Gladly.

345
00:18:41,964 --> 00:18:42,989
That's enough!

346
00:18:43,066 --> 00:18:45,128
Whose side are you on?

347
00:18:45,171 --> 00:18:46,731
There's a difference
between interrogation

348
00:18:46,775 --> 00:18:47,869
and torture.

349
00:18:47,911 --> 00:18:50,314
The Alliance never made
that distinction.

350
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,546
But you should.

351
00:18:54,727 --> 00:18:57,028
Take her back to her cell.

352
00:19:02,312 --> 00:19:04,841
Well done.

353
00:19:04,885 --> 00:19:07,517
I have to admit,
the last time you were here

354
00:19:07,558 --> 00:19:09,323
you had me completely fooled.

355
00:19:09,363 --> 00:19:12,826
I really thought you were
my Benjamin Sisko.

356
00:19:12,871 --> 00:19:14,602
That was the idea.

357
00:19:20,389 --> 00:19:21,983
Help me escape

358
00:19:22,026 --> 00:19:25,660
and I promise
I'll be grateful...

359
00:19:25,702 --> 00:19:28,196
very grateful.

360
00:19:28,241 --> 00:19:30,371
I'm sure you would be

361
00:19:30,413 --> 00:19:33,683
but don't count on it.

362
00:19:33,721 --> 00:19:36,387
Well, then perhaps you'll find
Marani and have her sent

363
00:19:36,428 --> 00:19:37,418
to my holding cell?

364
00:19:37,463 --> 00:19:38,431
Marani?

365
00:19:38,466 --> 00:19:39,560
One of my servants.

366
00:19:39,601 --> 00:19:40,934
I am a touch sore

367
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:44,673
and she does give
the most exquisite massages.

368
00:19:51,397 --> 00:19:52,593
A ship?

369
00:19:52,632 --> 00:19:54,626
What kind of ship?

370
00:19:54,671 --> 00:19:57,907
According to our reports,
it's of unknown classification

371
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,646
and carries
an impressive weapons array...

372
00:20:00,686 --> 00:20:02,589
some kind of improved
photon torpedoes

373
00:20:02,623 --> 00:20:06,086
multitargeting phaser banks...

374
00:20:06,131 --> 00:20:08,125
How long
until it is operational?

375
00:20:08,203 --> 00:20:09,763
Within two days.

376
00:20:09,807 --> 00:20:12,244
I know
it's none of my business

377
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,148
but perhaps it would be prudent

378
00:20:14,184 --> 00:20:15,847
to increase our speed
to warp nine.

379
00:20:15,889 --> 00:20:16,857
Quiet!

380
00:20:16,891 --> 00:20:19,659
I was merely
trying to be of service.

381
00:20:19,697 --> 00:20:21,725
If it was not
for your incompetence

382
00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:23,257
the rebels would have
been destroyed.

383
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,449
I thought we'd agreed

384
00:20:24,493 --> 00:20:27,193
that it was the Intendant
who was incompetent.

385
00:20:27,233 --> 00:20:29,568
I was merely
following her orders.

386
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:32,476
And for following those orders,
you deserve to die.

387
00:20:32,512 --> 00:20:34,175
Then why don't you kill me?

388
00:20:34,216 --> 00:20:36,745
The Intendant was bad enough.

389
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:39,694
She was irrational, accusatory,
unappreciative

390
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:40,755
but at least...

391
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:47,943
At least what?

392
00:20:47,983 --> 00:20:50,512
At least...

393
00:20:50,555 --> 00:20:55,397
I was able to please her,
now and then.

394
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:06,156
You are not my type.

395
00:21:06,193 --> 00:21:09,861
I never said I was.

396
00:21:11,205 --> 00:21:13,142
Increase speed to warp nine.

397
00:21:18,824 --> 00:21:20,521
So, what do you think?

398
00:21:20,594 --> 00:21:22,724
It was delicious.

399
00:21:22,766 --> 00:21:24,235
What do you call it?

400
00:21:24,269 --> 00:21:26,137
Chicken à la Sisko.

401
00:21:26,174 --> 00:21:29,478
How did you learn
to cook like this?

402
00:21:29,516 --> 00:21:32,854
Well, uh, all Sisko men
have the cooking gene.

403
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:33,950
Oh.

404
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:36,761
Yeah, you should try my
father's shrimp creole.

405
00:21:38,136 --> 00:21:39,628
Maybe one day, I will.

406
00:21:41,979 --> 00:21:42,969
Come in.

407
00:21:46,456 --> 00:21:48,450
Jake, it's time
to call it a day.

408
00:21:48,494 --> 00:21:51,592
How about some
chicken à la Sisko?

409
00:21:51,636 --> 00:21:53,299
Jake made dinner.

410
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:54,808
It's delicious.

411
00:21:54,843 --> 00:21:57,110
I am too tired to eat.

412
00:21:57,148 --> 00:21:58,116
Jake-o.

413
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,176
In a minute, Dad.

414
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,245
I don't want to leave a mess.

415
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,987
Oh, that's really not necessary.

416
00:22:02,027 --> 00:22:03,621
No, I want to.

417
00:22:20,304 --> 00:22:22,707
How's the work
on the <i>Defiant</i> coming?

418
00:22:22,743 --> 00:22:24,839
Slowly.

419
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,641
Does that feel better?

420
00:22:36,744 --> 00:22:39,649
Yes, but I don't know what
you expect to gain by it.

421
00:22:39,751 --> 00:22:42,588
I don't expect to gain anything.

422
00:22:42,624 --> 00:22:46,657
I just want to remind you
that I am not your enemy.

423
00:22:46,768 --> 00:22:49,103
I don't know why you're
being so hard on me.

424
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,478
After all, you pretended
to be my husband

425
00:22:52,515 --> 00:22:53,848
and I've forgiven you.

426
00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:01,867
By the way, you have done
a good job with him.

427
00:23:03,474 --> 00:23:05,570
Jake, I mean.

428
00:23:05,612 --> 00:23:08,278
Well, you're not making
that job any easier.

429
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:11,190
Oh... he'll get over me.

430
00:23:11,226 --> 00:23:12,194
Maybe.

431
00:23:12,228 --> 00:23:14,996
I wish I could say the same.

432
00:23:18,076 --> 00:23:20,411
Is that really a surprise?

433
00:23:20,448 --> 00:23:22,612
Think about it.

434
00:23:22,653 --> 00:23:25,455
My Ben Sisko is dead.

435
00:23:27,131 --> 00:23:28,896
I look at Jake...

436
00:23:28,935 --> 00:23:31,908
and all I see...

437
00:23:31,942 --> 00:23:34,938
is the son
that I'll never have.

438
00:23:37,623 --> 00:23:39,058
Maybe bringing him here

439
00:23:39,093 --> 00:23:41,223
wasn't such a good idea
after all.

440
00:23:44,773 --> 00:23:46,299
For any of us.

441
00:23:47,312 --> 00:23:48,337
Come in.

442
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:53,926
I've just got word.

443
00:23:53,962 --> 00:23:56,297
The Alliance fleet is less
than eight hours away.

444
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:58,932
I guess we've run out of time.

445
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,411
You concentrate on getting
the weapons array on-line.

446
00:24:15,447 --> 00:24:17,680
I'll calibrate
the SIF generators.

447
00:24:17,719 --> 00:24:20,283
Eight hours...
it's not a lot of time, is it?

448
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:21,293
It's all we have.

449
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:22,317
Smiley!

450
00:24:24,034 --> 00:24:25,765
Your assembly crew

451
00:24:25,838 --> 00:24:28,002
won't let me
into the torpedo bay.

452
00:24:28,043 --> 00:24:29,205
That's because they're trying

453
00:24:29,246 --> 00:24:32,048
to get the torpedo chambering
mechanism on-line.

454
00:24:32,086 --> 00:24:33,180
Oh, great.

455
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:36,094
So what am I supposed to do
with these torpedoes?!

456
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:37,793
I have a few suggestions.

457
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:39,736
Do you, now?

458
00:24:39,772 --> 00:24:41,036
This isn't getting us anywhere.

459
00:24:41,075 --> 00:24:42,704
We need to buy ourselves
some more time.

460
00:24:42,745 --> 00:24:44,078
Any ideas?

461
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:45,482
How many raiders
have we got left?

462
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:46,647
Only one.

463
00:24:46,688 --> 00:24:48,955
There's no way we can
stop the Alliance attack.

464
00:24:48,994 --> 00:24:50,828
Maybe not, but I might
be able to buy more time

465
00:24:50,931 --> 00:24:51,830
before they get here.

466
00:24:51,934 --> 00:24:53,403
You'll never make it back.

467
00:24:53,438 --> 00:24:56,309
Is that what you're
worried about?

468
00:24:56,345 --> 00:24:57,780
I thought it was because

469
00:24:57,815 --> 00:24:59,843
I was going to reap
all the glory.

470
00:24:59,886 --> 00:25:02,518
What good is glory
when you're dead?

471
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,054
Who said anything
about dying?

472
00:25:05,099 --> 00:25:07,195
When are... we leaving?

473
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:11,905
I never liked staying
in one place for very long.

474
00:25:12,951 --> 00:25:15,924
Then, it's settled.

475
00:25:15,958 --> 00:25:17,393
Before you go

476
00:25:17,428 --> 00:25:21,495
we'd better make damned sure
you can get us that extra time.

477
00:25:21,538 --> 00:25:25,605
Me help you
fight the Alliance...

478
00:25:25,648 --> 00:25:29,681
what a perverse idea.

479
00:25:29,725 --> 00:25:31,126
I have a better one.

480
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:32,962
Why don't I cut your throat?

481
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:35,334
Quick death...

482
00:25:35,372 --> 00:25:38,972
much less painful than anything
the Regent will do to you.

483
00:25:40,651 --> 00:25:42,245
I think you'd better worry

484
00:25:42,288 --> 00:25:45,125
about what the Regent
is going to do to you.

485
00:25:45,161 --> 00:25:48,157
The Regent has no reason
to question my loyalty.

486
00:25:48,202 --> 00:25:50,902
It's not your loyalty
he'll be questioning.

487
00:25:50,975 --> 00:25:52,444
It's your effectiveness.

488
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:55,715
After all, he wouldn't have
to retake Terok Nor

489
00:25:55,753 --> 00:25:58,088
if you hadn't lost it
in the first place.

490
00:25:58,126 --> 00:25:59,561
I didn't lose anything.

491
00:25:59,596 --> 00:26:02,569
It was Garak and the rest
of those Alliance fools.

492
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:04,404
Their excessive brutality...

493
00:26:04,441 --> 00:26:06,674
I could never
make them understand

494
00:26:06,713 --> 00:26:08,980
violence is
a precision instrument.

495
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:11,490
It's a scalpel, not a club.

496
00:26:11,525 --> 00:26:13,792
Garak was smart enough
to escape.

497
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,197
Garak is a coward.

498
00:26:15,233 --> 00:26:17,397
He ran at the first sign
of danger.

499
00:26:17,438 --> 00:26:19,841
Probably straight
into the Regent's arms

500
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:21,712
where he, no doubt,
laid the blame

501
00:26:21,749 --> 00:26:24,381
for the loss of this station
entirely on you.

502
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:28,598
You have a point.

503
00:26:28,632 --> 00:26:29,862
Good.

504
00:26:29,902 --> 00:26:31,930
Then I'll ask you again.

505
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,605
Is there any weakness
in the Alliance fleet

506
00:26:34,646 --> 00:26:36,343
something we can exploit?

507
00:26:36,384 --> 00:26:39,654
It's a possibility.

508
00:26:40,995 --> 00:26:43,262
Why don't you lower
this force field

509
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,864
and join me in here?

510
00:26:45,907 --> 00:26:49,507
It might help stimulate
my thought process.

511
00:26:49,549 --> 00:26:51,918
I should think self-preservation

512
00:26:51,955 --> 00:26:54,324
would be stimulation
enough for you.

513
00:26:54,361 --> 00:26:56,594
That's not
a very friendly attitude...

514
00:26:56,633 --> 00:26:58,536
especially when you
want my help.

515
00:26:59,573 --> 00:27:01,270
Oh.

516
00:27:01,311 --> 00:27:03,578
It's Professor Sisko, isn't it?

517
00:27:03,616 --> 00:27:05,814
Well, she's very attractive

518
00:27:05,855 --> 00:27:08,623
but I've known Breen icicles
that are warmer than she is.

519
00:27:08,662 --> 00:27:11,260
This has nothing to do with her.

520
00:27:11,302 --> 00:27:13,432
If you say so.

521
00:27:13,473 --> 00:27:15,944
Still...

522
00:27:15,979 --> 00:27:19,921
I've never been able to resist
anyone named Benjamin Sisko.

523
00:27:21,095 --> 00:27:23,932
The Alliance ships
are quick and powerful

524
00:27:23,969 --> 00:27:26,304
but they do have one weakness...

525
00:27:26,342 --> 00:27:29,042
their targeting systems
can be fooled.

526
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:32,248
They've been known
to chase warp shadows.

527
00:27:34,327 --> 00:27:36,856
How do I know I can believe you?

528
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,737
You're just going
to have to trust me.

529
00:27:54,642 --> 00:27:56,806
The key... where is it?

530
00:27:56,848 --> 00:27:58,215
You're not listening.

531
00:27:58,251 --> 00:27:59,880
I didn't take the key.

532
00:28:01,693 --> 00:28:03,664
You are lying.

533
00:28:03,698 --> 00:28:04,860
I'm telling you.

534
00:28:04,901 --> 00:28:07,202
He stole it from me
while I was feeding him!

535
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:11,613
Don't make me ask you again.

536
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:16,058
What good would the key do me?

537
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:17,962
Even if I were
to unlock this collar

538
00:28:17,999 --> 00:28:19,195
where could I go?

539
00:28:19,235 --> 00:28:21,399
I can't get off this ship

540
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,405
and besides, you've searched me
three times already.

541
00:28:25,449 --> 00:28:27,920
Where could I possibly
be hiding it?

542
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,756
Perhaps you swallowed it.

543
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:31,228
Impossible.

544
00:28:31,263 --> 00:28:33,496
I'm very particular
about what I eat.

545
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,911
We will see about that.

546
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,646
Regent!

547
00:28:41,722 --> 00:28:42,816
What is it?!

548
00:28:42,858 --> 00:28:45,159
The... key, sir.

549
00:28:45,197 --> 00:28:47,668
Somehow it fell into...

550
00:28:47,703 --> 00:28:49,537
my boot.

551
00:28:49,574 --> 00:28:52,068
Now do you believe me?

552
00:28:59,665 --> 00:29:02,365
If he dies, you die.

553
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:11,091
Six rebel raiders
are approaching

554
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:13,655
bearing 354 mark 008.

555
00:29:13,699 --> 00:29:15,636
Their sensors have detected us.

556
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:17,300
They're fleeing.

557
00:29:17,341 --> 00:29:19,973
Wise choice

558
00:29:20,014 --> 00:29:22,451
but they will not get far.

559
00:29:23,455 --> 00:29:25,015
I hope these warp shadows
we're emitting

560
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,028
are going to fool them.

561
00:29:26,062 --> 00:29:27,999
We'll know as soon
as they start firing.

562
00:29:54,129 --> 00:29:56,623
You look like you could use
another pair of hands.

563
00:29:56,668 --> 00:29:58,969
Smaller ones might help.

564
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:00,704
Here.

565
00:30:00,745 --> 00:30:03,377
Let me.

566
00:30:03,418 --> 00:30:05,355
I'm trying to recalibrate
the torque sensors.

567
00:30:05,389 --> 00:30:06,619
Yes, I know.

568
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:08,424
To control the inertial dampers.

569
00:30:09,499 --> 00:30:12,097
It's Professor Sisko, remember?

570
00:30:12,138 --> 00:30:13,505
Sorry.

571
00:30:13,542 --> 00:30:14,601
For what it's worth

572
00:30:14,645 --> 00:30:17,812
you should know
that I've told Jake the truth

573
00:30:17,885 --> 00:30:21,417
about my visit to you,
why I brought him here

574
00:30:21,461 --> 00:30:22,429
everything.

575
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,592
And?

576
00:30:23,633 --> 00:30:27,096
And he said
that it doesn't matter.

577
00:30:27,141 --> 00:30:29,044
That he's still glad
to have met me.

578
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:31,516
Funny thing is,
I know he means it.

579
00:30:31,552 --> 00:30:33,955
He has a forgiving nature.

580
00:30:33,991 --> 00:30:36,657
Mmm. It's more than that.

581
00:30:36,698 --> 00:30:40,195
I don't think he could be angry
with me even if he wanted to.

582
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,304
I remind him too much
of his mother.

583
00:30:43,347 --> 00:30:46,879
He loved her very much.

584
00:30:46,922 --> 00:30:49,952
No one has ever cared about me
like that before.

585
00:30:53,772 --> 00:30:55,640
So...

586
00:30:55,676 --> 00:30:58,912
if it's all right with you,
I will see to it

587
00:30:59,018 --> 00:31:01,582
that he is sent back
to Deep Space 9.

588
00:31:01,624 --> 00:31:02,421
When?

589
00:31:02,459 --> 00:31:03,860
Right away.

590
00:31:03,963 --> 00:31:06,366
What's Smiley going
to say about that?

591
00:31:06,402 --> 00:31:08,566
He trusts you
to finish your job.

592
00:31:08,607 --> 00:31:10,270
And...

593
00:31:10,312 --> 00:31:11,406
so do I.

594
00:31:14,555 --> 00:31:17,187
Would you...
like to say good-bye to him?

595
00:31:17,227 --> 00:31:19,698
I'd better finish here.

596
00:31:19,734 --> 00:31:23,004
Uh, tell Jake I'll see him soon.

597
00:31:25,046 --> 00:31:27,176
Ben?

598
00:31:28,588 --> 00:31:31,527
When we first met,
there was a...

599
00:31:31,562 --> 00:31:34,729
a connection between us

600
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:37,743
and now,
because of what I've done

601
00:31:37,777 --> 00:31:39,611
it's gone, isn't it?

602
00:31:40,651 --> 00:31:43,715
I'm not sure it was real
to begin with.

603
00:31:52,346 --> 00:31:54,944
I better go get Jake home.

604
00:32:18,006 --> 00:32:19,202
Hey!

605
00:32:19,243 --> 00:32:21,077
- What are you doing there?
- Nothing.

606
00:32:21,115 --> 00:32:22,584
- I'm just thinking.
- Well, think somewhere else...

607
00:32:22,618 --> 00:32:23,985
you're making me uncomfortable.

608
00:32:25,225 --> 00:32:26,558
What's so funny?

609
00:32:26,594 --> 00:32:29,192
Where I come from, it's you
and I that would hang out here

610
00:32:29,234 --> 00:32:31,296
and it's your uncle
that would chase us away.

611
00:32:31,339 --> 00:32:33,333
Hey, am I supposed
to be impressed by that?

612
00:32:33,377 --> 00:32:35,906
I don't care about
some parallel universe.

613
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,647
I only care about this one.

614
00:32:37,687 --> 00:32:38,917
And in this one, I run a bar

615
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,825
and you do your thinking
in your quarters.

616
00:32:40,861 --> 00:32:42,592
All right.
You made your point.

617
00:32:43,601 --> 00:32:45,002
I'm waiting.

618
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:46,530
- I'm going.
- Good.

619
00:32:46,575 --> 00:32:49,514
You're a long way from home,
hu-man.

620
00:32:50,618 --> 00:32:51,712
I guess I am.

621
00:32:51,755 --> 00:32:53,054
Jake?

622
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:55,062
I need to speak with you.

623
00:32:55,162 --> 00:32:56,152
In private.

624
00:32:57,234 --> 00:32:58,259
Sure.

625
00:33:18,117 --> 00:33:19,609
Tell me something.

626
00:33:19,655 --> 00:33:22,287
Are you as bored as I am?

627
00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:28,298
I'll take that as a "yes."

628
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:32,546
You know, I bet if we put our...

629
00:33:32,586 --> 00:33:34,489
heads together

630
00:33:34,523 --> 00:33:37,655
we could create a little
excitement for ourselves.

631
00:33:37,698 --> 00:33:40,796
You sentenced my wife to death.

632
00:33:40,838 --> 00:33:43,572
Isn't that a coincidence?

633
00:33:43,612 --> 00:33:45,947
I was hoping
you weren't married.

634
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,978
I've prepared
the Intendant's dinner.

635
00:33:48,022 --> 00:33:49,355
Show me.

636
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,668
Nicely done.

637
00:34:07,703 --> 00:34:08,933
Thank you.

638
00:34:08,973 --> 00:34:11,467
I have a ship waiting for you
at Landing Pad C.

639
00:34:11,512 --> 00:34:13,106
I'm going to need that
more than you will.

640
00:34:13,182 --> 00:34:15,585
I wasn't aware we were
on the same side.

641
00:34:15,622 --> 00:34:18,322
You killed my father
and my uncle.

642
00:34:18,362 --> 00:34:20,799
Thanks to you, I own the bar.

643
00:34:38,013 --> 00:34:39,539
Jettison
the docking scaffold.

644
00:34:41,254 --> 00:34:42,689
Captain.

645
00:34:42,724 --> 00:34:44,318
I think it's time for you to go.

646
00:34:44,361 --> 00:34:46,024
I believe that was
the agreement.

647
00:34:46,065 --> 00:34:47,033
I'm on my way.

648
00:34:47,068 --> 00:34:48,298
Just wanted to wish you luck.

649
00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:49,306
Thanks.

650
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,775
You've given us a fine ship.

651
00:34:52,582 --> 00:34:53,550
I only wish

652
00:34:53,584 --> 00:34:55,144
I could have gotten
to know her better

653
00:34:55,221 --> 00:34:57,124
before taking her into battle.

654
00:34:57,159 --> 00:35:00,155
Still, there's nothing like
a little on-the-job training

655
00:35:00,233 --> 00:35:02,295
to get the adrenaline pumping.

656
00:35:03,708 --> 00:35:06,111
Get out of that chair,
Smiley.

657
00:35:06,181 --> 00:35:07,114
What do you mean?

658
00:35:07,183 --> 00:35:08,208
Just do it.

659
00:35:09,488 --> 00:35:10,456
Seal the airlock.

660
00:35:10,491 --> 00:35:11,459
Release docking clamps.

661
00:35:11,493 --> 00:35:13,122
Aft thrusters
at one-quarter impulse.

662
00:35:13,197 --> 00:35:16,034
What are you standing
there for, Smiley?

663
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:18,371
Captain, you never
cease to amaze me.

664
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,813
Sometimes
I even surprise myself.

665
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:24,751
How long do you think
the station's shields

666
00:35:24,792 --> 00:35:26,592
can withstand
the Alliance assault?

667
00:35:26,629 --> 00:35:27,791
Long enough for us
to see how tough

668
00:35:27,832 --> 00:35:28,822
this ship of yours really is.

669
00:35:28,868 --> 00:35:30,736
Let's find out.
Take us out of here.

670
00:35:31,741 --> 00:35:33,370
You're sure you want
to leave now?

671
00:35:34,448 --> 00:35:36,179
I'm hoping this new rebel ship

672
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,157
keeps the Alliance busy
while I get to Bajor.

673
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,853
I have friends there
who will hide me.

674
00:35:39,895 --> 00:35:41,159
Well, don't worry about me.

675
00:35:41,197 --> 00:35:42,894
I won't tell anyone
where you are.

676
00:35:48,348 --> 00:35:49,942
Nog.

677
00:35:54,096 --> 00:35:55,155
You're right.

678
00:35:55,198 --> 00:35:57,101
You won't tell anyone.

679
00:36:02,148 --> 00:36:05,178
I don't see why you can't come
to Deep Space 9 with me.

680
00:36:05,222 --> 00:36:07,716
Believe me, Jake, it's better
in the long run if I don't

681
00:36:07,762 --> 00:36:08,730
for all of us.

682
00:36:08,764 --> 00:36:09,994
Jennifer.

683
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:13,064
You look as beautiful as ever.

684
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:42,039
A bird-of-prey
is locked on to us.

685
00:36:42,077 --> 00:36:44,310
Evasive maneuvers,
pattern delta.

686
00:36:45,518 --> 00:36:47,283
Pattern delta... what's that?

687
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:48,950
- Rock her.
- Rock her?

688
00:36:48,993 --> 00:36:50,292
Port to starboard, hard.

689
00:36:50,397 --> 00:36:51,387
Got it.

690
00:36:55,777 --> 00:36:56,871
Can't lose her.

691
00:36:56,912 --> 00:36:57,743
Hard to port.

692
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,370
Fire!

693
00:37:19,065 --> 00:37:21,161
I must remember that one.

694
00:37:23,175 --> 00:37:25,669
You know, I really have
to thank you, Jennifer.

695
00:37:25,715 --> 00:37:30,158
Not only do you guarantee me
safe passage off this station

696
00:37:30,192 --> 00:37:33,428
but you make the perfect gift
for the Regent as well.

697
00:37:33,466 --> 00:37:35,733
You want me to go with you?
Fine.

698
00:37:35,772 --> 00:37:37,435
But leave the boy here.

699
00:37:40,116 --> 00:37:42,314
Why is he so important to you?

700
00:37:42,355 --> 00:37:43,881
That doesn't matter.

701
00:37:43,925 --> 00:37:45,622
You're not taking him.

702
00:37:45,662 --> 00:37:48,829
I've never seen you
so passionate.

703
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,464
It gives you a lovely glow.

704
00:37:53,114 --> 00:37:54,082
All right.

705
00:37:54,116 --> 00:37:56,019
He doesn't have to come.

706
00:37:56,054 --> 00:37:57,284
No!

707
00:38:00,531 --> 00:38:02,091
Well, that was unfortunate.

708
00:38:02,136 --> 00:38:04,073
She needs a doctor.

709
00:38:04,106 --> 00:38:05,837
Mmm...

710
00:38:05,878 --> 00:38:07,678
I'm afraid it's too late...

711
00:38:07,715 --> 00:38:09,515
for both of you.

712
00:38:11,725 --> 00:38:14,698
Just out of curiosity...

713
00:38:14,732 --> 00:38:17,466
why was she protecting you?

714
00:38:23,052 --> 00:38:24,351
She's my mother.

715
00:38:24,389 --> 00:38:26,587
Your mother?

716
00:38:26,628 --> 00:38:29,567
You're Sisko's son.

717
00:38:29,601 --> 00:38:31,264
From the other side?

718
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:35,775
Well, in that case...

719
00:38:35,816 --> 00:38:38,310
give your father
a message from me.

720
00:38:38,355 --> 00:38:40,690
Tell him I spared your life.

721
00:38:40,727 --> 00:38:42,891
That's a debt
I intend to collect.

722
00:38:50,551 --> 00:38:52,613
Shields are down to 40 percent.

723
00:38:52,656 --> 00:38:54,057
That cruiser has us
in weapons range.

724
00:38:54,093 --> 00:38:55,061
Do we make a run for it?

725
00:38:55,096 --> 00:38:57,898
We run all right... right at it.

726
00:38:57,936 --> 00:38:59,599
Ah... pattern suicide.

727
00:39:05,153 --> 00:39:07,317
Concentrate your fire
on that ship.

728
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:08,326
It's changing course.

729
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,693
It's headed directly toward us.

730
00:39:09,731 --> 00:39:12,168
Good. That should
make things easier.

731
00:39:12,203 --> 00:39:14,903
Terok Nor will soon
be ours again.

732
00:39:16,279 --> 00:39:18,409
Then you can spend
the rest of your life

733
00:39:18,451 --> 00:39:20,080
contemplating your failure

734
00:39:20,123 --> 00:39:22,253
as you labor
alongside the other slaves

735
00:39:22,294 --> 00:39:23,888
in the ore processing center.

736
00:39:23,931 --> 00:39:26,368
It's nice to have something
to look forward to.

737
00:39:32,418 --> 00:39:34,252
Shields down to 25 percent.

738
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:35,986
One more hit could finish us.

739
00:39:36,027 --> 00:39:37,895
Then we'll have to make
sure we don't get hit.

740
00:39:37,931 --> 00:39:39,264
I'll take the helm.

741
00:39:39,301 --> 00:39:40,395
Nothing personal...

742
00:39:40,437 --> 00:39:42,031
I just know this ship
better than you.

743
00:39:42,074 --> 00:39:43,839
She's all yours.

744
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,879
Hold on!

745
00:40:18,362 --> 00:40:20,595
I want that ship destroyed now!

746
00:40:20,634 --> 00:40:21,933
They're flying too close.

747
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:23,064
I can't target them.

748
00:40:24,577 --> 00:40:27,243
We put a hole
in their forward shields.

749
00:40:27,283 --> 00:40:29,083
Nice shooting, Smiley.

750
00:40:29,121 --> 00:40:30,089
Hold on.

751
00:40:30,123 --> 00:40:32,253
A bird-of-prey
just locked on to us.

752
00:40:32,295 --> 00:40:34,732
Secondary power to aft shields.

753
00:40:34,768 --> 00:40:36,431
What secondary power?
You got to get us out of here.

754
00:40:36,471 --> 00:40:39,205
We can't risk giving the cruiser
a clear shot.

755
00:40:39,245 --> 00:40:41,079
I was just starting
to like this ship.

756
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,025
Yeah!

757
00:40:52,009 --> 00:40:52,977
Bashir to <i>Defiant.</i>

758
00:40:53,011 --> 00:40:54,845
Aren't you going
to welcome me back?

759
00:40:54,882 --> 00:40:57,115
I never thought I'd be happy
to hear your voice.

760
00:40:57,154 --> 00:40:58,453
You'll get over it.

761
00:40:58,491 --> 00:40:59,892
Sisko to Bashir.

762
00:40:59,928 --> 00:41:02,457
Concentrate your fire
on their forward shields.

763
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:03,534
With pleasure.

764
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:23,181
Forgive me, my Regent

765
00:41:23,281 --> 00:41:25,012
but perhaps
the moment has arrived

766
00:41:25,052 --> 00:41:27,752
to remove your august presence
from the battlefield.

767
00:41:27,792 --> 00:41:29,421
You mean retreat.

768
00:41:29,462 --> 00:41:31,456
I hope I'm not out of line.

769
00:41:35,009 --> 00:41:36,740
The cruiser's changing course.

770
00:41:36,781 --> 00:41:38,080
They're going to warp.

771
00:41:43,128 --> 00:41:44,222
The other Alliance ships

772
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:46,495
have broken off their attack
on the station.

773
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:48,633
We've won.

774
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:49,665
You sound surprised.

775
00:41:49,712 --> 00:41:50,771
Surprised?

776
00:41:50,814 --> 00:41:52,249
I'm astonished.

777
00:41:52,317 --> 00:41:54,584
Not that I'm complaining.

778
00:41:55,692 --> 00:41:57,595
I have been betrayed!

779
00:41:59,501 --> 00:42:02,099
There can be no other
explanation for my defeat.

780
00:42:02,141 --> 00:42:04,305
I certainly can't think of any.

781
00:42:04,346 --> 00:42:07,684
The traitor must be
found and punished.

782
00:42:07,721 --> 00:42:08,951
She will.

783
00:42:08,991 --> 00:42:12,625
It is the Intendant we're
talking about, isn't it?

784
00:42:12,666 --> 00:42:16,107
The Intendant.

785
00:42:16,142 --> 00:42:18,409
Of course.

786
00:42:18,447 --> 00:42:23,221
All I ask is
that when the moment comes

787
00:42:23,259 --> 00:42:25,925
that you allow me,
your humble servant

788
00:42:25,964 --> 00:42:28,732
the honor of administering
her punishment.

789
00:42:28,771 --> 00:42:29,967
I promise you

790
00:42:30,008 --> 00:42:35,282
she will regret her disloyalty
before she dies.

791
00:42:35,353 --> 00:42:37,985
And while you dispose
of the Intendant

792
00:42:38,027 --> 00:42:42,527
I will dispose of the rebels.

793
00:42:42,572 --> 00:42:45,170
Make it so.

794
00:43:02,653 --> 00:43:04,122
Dad...

795
00:43:04,156 --> 00:43:05,819
See, I told you he'd come.

796
00:43:09,502 --> 00:43:11,165
How is she?

797
00:43:23,201 --> 00:43:24,864
Ben...

798
00:43:24,906 --> 00:43:26,034
Easy.

799
00:43:32,825 --> 00:43:36,322
I knew we were still connected.

800
00:43:36,367 --> 00:43:39,238
Always.

801
00:44:03,532 --> 00:44:05,024
Dad...

802
00:44:20,606 --> 00:44:22,941
Let's go home.
