1
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:18,477
Enjoying the view?

2
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:21,104
Uh, I'm stuck on this
new story I'm working on

3
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,982
and coming here
helps me...

4
00:00:22,982 --> 00:00:24,942
No need to explain,
Mr. Sisko.

5
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:26,986
I just...

6
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:28,445
thought...

7
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:31,365
You just thought what?

8
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,410
I thought you were going
to ask me to leave.

9
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:38,664
Why would I do that?

10
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:40,624
You always used
to chase me away.

11
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:41,917
I never chased<i> you</i> away.

12
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:43,752
I chased Nog.

13
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,420
You just happened
to be with him.

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,172
So, unless you're planning

15
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,884
on flicking sand peas
at the passing throng

16
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:52,761
you're welcome to stay here
as long as you like.

17
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,347
I don't have any sand peas.

18
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,268
You miss him, don't you?

19
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:03,605
Nog?

20
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:04,899
Maybe a little.

21
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:06,358
QUARK:
A little!

22
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:08,777
There isn't a day goes by

23
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:12,656
that I don't see him
standing here, pining away

24
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:14,575
for that no-good
nephew of mine.

25
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:17,036
I'm not here<i> every</i> day.
No--

26
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:19,538
just four or five
times a week.

27
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:21,206
If you ask me,
Nog should never

28
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,791
have gone off
to the Academy.

29
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,252
You lost a friend
and I lost a good waiter.

30
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:26,587
Nog will be back

31
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,255
and he'll be wearing
a Starfleet uniform.

32
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:29,924
I'm proud
of what he's doing.

33
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:31,759
Remember that
the next time you try

34
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,093
and play dom-jot
by yourself.

35
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:35,930
You don't want me
hanging around here?

36
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,265
Fine. I'll do my thinking
someplace else.

37
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:43,979
Poor kid.

38
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,607
I suppose that's what you
get for having friends.

39
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,025
Meaning what?

40
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:50,360
Just that when you think
you can count on them

41
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,946
they go off and leave you.

42
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:54,656
No. You're much
better off without them.

43
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,034
I imagine that's why you
don't have any friends.

44
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,619
Look who's talking.

45
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:12,132
Dad, I'm home.

46
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,646
Mom?

47
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:31,312
I'm afraid
I'm not your mother, Jake.

48
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,774
This is the woman
I told you about--

49
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,734
the one I met
in the parallel universe.

50
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,653
So...

51
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,740
you're Jennifer Sisko,
but you're just not my mom.

52
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,158
That's right.

53
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,536
You look
exactly like her.

54
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,329
And I was married to a man

55
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,958
who looked exactly
like your father.

56
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,709
It's all a little
confusing, isn't it?

57
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:53,961
More than a little.

58
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,336
Did you tell her?

59
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:56,588
Tell her what?

60
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,298
Ever since my dad
told me about you

61
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,507
I've been wanting
to meet you.

62
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,635
Well...

63
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,470
here I am.

64
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,389
You even sound like my mother.

65
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,515
KIRA:
Ops to Captain Sisko.

66
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:08,892
Go ahead.

67
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,352
Minister Gettor's shuttle
has docked.

68
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,605
Give me a few minutes.

69
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,190
Offer him a tour of the station.

70
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,566
I already have.

71
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,944
His time here is limited
and he's anxious

72
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,946
to meet with the Emissary.

73
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:23,031
I'll be right there.

74
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,574
So, why are you here?

75
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,326
I came here to see your father.

76
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,577
Really?

77
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,454
That's great.

78
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,372
Jennifer came
to give me some good news.

79
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:33,458
The Terrans have won
an important victory.

80
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,295
We've driven the Alliance
off of the space station.

81
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:40,299
Then the rebels
control Terok Nor.

82
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:43,010
I see your father
has told you all about us.

83
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:47,639
Well, I guess I better
get to my meeting.

84
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:48,849
I understand.

85
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,518
It's not like you
were expecting me.

86
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,562
You're not
leaving, are you?

87
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:58,608
Is it all right if I visit
with Jake for a while?

88
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,819
I don't think Jake would have it
any other way.

89
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:04,281
Maybe the three of us
can have dinner together.

90
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,449
The depends on how long
my meeting lasts.

91
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,869
We'll wait.

92
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,830
Okay.

93
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,800
Uh, would you like
another<i> raktajino?</i>

94
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,719
Thank you.

95
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,846
That would be nice.

96
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,806
That's amazing.

97
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,766
What?

98
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,144
I never thought I'd
hold these hands again.

99
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,479
They feel just
like my mother's.

100
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,485
Um...

101
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,446
I... I'll get you
that<i> raktajino.</i>

102
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,633
Well, that went well.

103
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:08,011
I think you made it clear
to the Minister

104
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,679
why the Emissary
can't endorse

105
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,098
his land reform program.

106
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,974
It only took three hours.

107
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,475
If you like,
we can go over

108
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,270
the weekly
personnel reports.

109
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,771
In the morning.

110
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,315
I have someone waiting for me
in my quarters.

111
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:25,445
Jake!

112
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,654
Jennifer.

113
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:33,995
Computer, locate Jake Sisko.

114
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,998
Jake Sisko
is not on the station.

115
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,013
(<i> sighs</i> )

116
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,810
Are you sure this is
what Smiley used

117
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,603
to transport you to
the alternate universe?

118
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,021
Looks like it.

119
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,689
And you're convinced
Jake's gone over there?

120
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,067
He's not on the station
and neither is Jennifer.

121
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,569
Maybe he convinced her to take
him over there for a visit.

122
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,322
Without asking me?

123
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:11,699
It could be she left that behind
as an invitation to join them.

124
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,577
And I accept--

125
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,872
but<i> only</i> to get Jake back.

126
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:18,999
Want some company?

127
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,335
I can think of safer
places to visit.

128
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:24,045
Major, you and the Chief
come with me.

129
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,546
Commander, you have Ops.

130
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,136
Expecting trouble, Major?

131
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:33,138
Just want to be prepared.

132
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:42,981
Energize.

133
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,373
Welcome back, Captain.

134
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,790
What happened to the others?

135
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,916
They weren't invited.

136
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:02,959
Where's my son?

137
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,169
He's with
Professor Sisko.

138
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,253
She's showing
him the station.

139
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,254
The tour's over.

140
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,547
I'm taking Jake home.

141
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,007
Then I'm afraid
we have a problem.

142
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,384
What kind of problem?

143
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:11,843
Jake's not going anywhere...

144
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,013
and neither are you.

145
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:24,022
Terok Nor in
rebel hands--

146
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,149
it just shows
what people can do

147
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,734
when their cause is just.

148
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,444
Save the speeches, Smiley.

149
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:32,406
Right now, I don't care
too much for you or your cause.

150
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,115
You've every right to be angry.

151
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,117
We haven't exactly
played fair with you.

152
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,952
You kidnapped my son.

153
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,246
Kidnapped?

154
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:41,915
An ugly word.

155
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:42,916
But accurate.

156
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,667
Tell me, Captain.

157
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,253
If we had come and<i> asked</i>
for your help

158
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,547
in fighting the Alliance,
what would you have said?

159
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:49,881
I'd have said no.

160
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,966
Which is why we had
to use your son

161
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,218
to lure you over here.

162
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,804
We need your help, Captain.

163
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,100
No one else will do.

164
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,601
Recognize her?

165
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,729
Ah...

166
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,481
The<i> Defiant.</i>

167
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:09,109
During our last encounter.
when I visited your station

168
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,818
I took a moment

169
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,321
to download as many of your
computer files as I could.

170
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,365
I figured they'd come
in handy someday

171
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:17,033
and they have.

172
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,494
You see, Captain, taking
Terok Nor was one thing.

173
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,621
Keeping it, that's
the tricky part.

174
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,540
The Alliance fleet
is already on its way.

175
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,041
When they get here

176
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,960
I want to have a proper
welcome ready for them.

177
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,878
These schematics look complete.

178
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,088
Why do you need me?

179
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,090
If you want to build
another<i> Defiant</i>

180
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,674
why do you need my help?

181
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,302
We've already built it.

182
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,762
The problem is, when we
power up its engines

183
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,265
the whole ship damn near
shakes itself apart.

184
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:41,433
We had the same trouble.

185
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:42,434
It's a powerful ship.

186
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:43,893
Well, right now, it's

187
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,104
a little too powerful
for its own good.

188
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:47,355
How did you solve it?

189
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,607
We had to overhaul

190
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:50,400
the structural integrity
field grids.

191
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,486
How long did it take?

192
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,028
Two weeks.

193
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,447
We have four days.

194
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:57,198
I'm not sure that's enough time.

195
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,699
It had better be.

196
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,368
Otherwise, the<i> Defiant</i> 
won't be ready

197
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,953
and you and your
son will die here

198
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,955
along with
the rest of us.

199
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,500
Or worse still-- spend
the rest of your lives

200
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,793
working in the ore
processing center

201
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,588
under the tender mercies
of an Alliance overseer.

202
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,757
Help us, Captain

203
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,676
and I promise we'll get you
and your son out of here

204
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,513
before the fireworks begin.

205
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:22,681
The<i> Defiant</i> is
at Docking Port 5.

206
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,100
I think you know the way.

207
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,019
I want to see my son first.

208
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,646
I knew you would.

209
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:33,943
Is he with us?

210
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,362
You remember

211
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:36,363
Captain Bashir.

212
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,822
Captain?

213
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,116
Captain Bashir.
Captain O'Brien.
Captain Sisko.

214
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,577
We may not have enough
troops or ships

215
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,497
or weapons, but we have
plenty of Captains.

216
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,748
Is he going to help us or not?!

217
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:50,793
You must have missed
that cheery face, hmm?

218
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,131
Relax.

219
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,300
The Captain has found it
in his heart

220
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,552
to aid us once again.

221
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:00,970
Good.

222
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,560
I owed you that.

223
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,144
I let you hit me once

224
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,146
because I thought you were
<i>our</i> Captain Sisko.

225
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,981
Now I know better.

226
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:15,109
We're even now.

227
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,826
If I were you, I'd
keep out of his way.

228
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,746
You and I friends?

229
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,790
I don't think so.

230
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,958
Why not?

231
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,252
You're too tall.

232
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,752
I don't trust
tall men.

233
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:35,630
Tall women--

234
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,216
ah-- that's a different story.

235
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:39,175
Here.

236
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,759
See for yourself.

237
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,557
Jake, isn't she
a little old for you?

238
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:46,765
Who are you?
His mother?

239
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:48,851
SISKO:
Jake!

240
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,105
Dad.

241
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,193
I'm-I'm sorry.

242
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,819
But I had to come.

243
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,030
Somehow, talking to Jennifer

244
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,617
telling her all
about the past nine years--

245
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,784
about all the things
that happened to me

246
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:08,121
what I've done, what
I've been thinking about--

247
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,664
it's like telling Mom.

248
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:12,125
In a lot of ways, she's
nothing like your mom.

249
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,378
Yeah, but in some ways,
she's just like her.

250
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,171
And not just physically.

251
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,591
She listens like Mom.

252
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:22,093
And it's the exact same smile.

253
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:23,511
Okay, Jake.

254
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,097
This place
is unbelievable.

255
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:28,849
Chief O'Brien, Dr. Bashir, Dax--
they're all here.

256
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:32,103
I mean, I know it's not
really them, but... look.

257
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,730
Here's Nog.

258
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,897
This is my father.

259
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,107
He's tall, too.

260
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,192
Look, Jake-o

261
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,069
I have to talk to Jennifer
alone for a minute.

262
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,571
She likes you.

263
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,906
Jake, whatever
you're thinking--

264
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,200
whatever plans
you're making--

265
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,452
forget about them.

266
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,828
I'm not making any plans.

267
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:53,832
Outside.

268
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,593
I just want to know
one thing--

269
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,136
whose idea was this?

270
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:06,220
Does it matter?

271
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,389
It does to me.

272
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,766
It was mine.

273
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,893
We needed you to help us
complete the ship.

274
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,895
Smiley told me all about you

275
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:18,274
about your wife's death,
about your son.

276
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,276
I knew that Jake
would want to meet me--

277
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,111
that I'd remind him
of his mother.

278
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,447
You're nothing like his mother.

279
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,324
I think Jake would disagree.

280
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:27,908
Of course, he would.

281
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:30,704
In his mind, the three of us
are already living together.

282
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:33,914
Ben, you're the one that
convinced me to join the rebels

283
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,958
to fight the good fight
for my people.

284
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,918
It's not your cause
that I have a problem with.

285
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,420
It's your methods.

286
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,881
I'm sorry if Jake's
feelings get hurt

287
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,008
but that's a small
price to pay

288
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,093
if it means success
against the Alliance.

289
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:49,639
All right, I'm here
and I'm going to help you

290
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:52,600
but I want you
to leave my son alone.

291
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:54,853
I can't.
Why not?

292
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:56,187
JAKE:
Jennifer.

293
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:03,778
Because he won't
leave me alone.

294
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,020
Bow before the Regent!

295
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,816
I can't think of anything
I'd rather do.

296
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:49,699
Ah, so this is the<i> p'tak</i>

297
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,492
who lost Terok Nor
to the rebels.

298
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,119
That's not exactly...

299
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:56,623
Are you calling me a liar?

300
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,212
(<i> gasps</i> )

301
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,005
I was merely observing

302
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:08,008
that as one of many officers
under the Intendant's command

303
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:10,052
it would be an overstatement

304
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:14,307
to imply that I, alone,
was responsible for our defeat.

305
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:17,602
But you are the only officer
who managed to escape.

306
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:20,688
Perhaps I should have
surrendered to the rebels...

307
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,608
groveling on the floor,
begging for my<i> life</i>

308
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,443
like the Intendant.

309
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:28,404
You are attempting to shift
the blame away from yourself.

310
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,114
Am I succeeding?

311
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,326
(<i> growls in frustration</i> )

312
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:36,287
This time, I will deal
with the rebels myself.

313
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:39,666
You will be at my side,
redeeming yourself in battle.

314
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,292
Your fairness

315
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,628
and good judgment are everything
I've heard them to be.

316
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:44,963
Believe me, my Regent

317
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:47,465
it will take the blood
of many rebels

318
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:50,050
to quench the thirst
of my revenge.

319
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,636
(<i> laughs raucously</i> )

320
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,387
Spoken like a Klingon.

321
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,139
I'm trying.

322
00:16:55,139 --> 00:17:00,227
Now, if you could just remove
this insufferable collar...

323
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:03,690
No, the collar stays
until every rebel on Terok Nor

324
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,775
lies dead at my feet.

325
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:06,860
(<i> groaning</i> )

326
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,011
Sisko to Smiley.

327
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:35,221
I'm about to put the deuterium
injector back on-line.

328
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,639
Go ahead.

329
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,391
I've got the flow regulators
shut off.

330
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,144
Injectors are operational.

331
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,022
You can recalibrate
the regulators now.

332
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:45,105
Will do.

333
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,485
I heard you were back.

334
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,656
That's for making love
to me under false pretenses.

335
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:55,867
I was suspicious
of you from the start.

336
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,035
You hid it well.

337
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:58,870
If you ever
touch me again...

338
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,121
Do you get my point?

339
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,665
I hope not.

340
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,375
(<i> yell of pain</i> )

341
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,045
(<i> woman cries out</i> )

342
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:09,589
(<i> screaming</i> )

343
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,215
What happened?

344
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:15,636
Ah-- you remember the
Intendant, don't you?

345
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,722
I was taking her to
an interrogation session

346
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,891
when the vile little tyrant
tried to escape.

347
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:21,642
(<i> screams</i> )

348
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:22,852
Oops.

349
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,437
Pick her up.
Leave her!

350
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,940
She's not through
with her lesson.

351
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,566
(<i> gasping</i> )

352
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,985
If this is supposed
to teach me a lesson

353
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:33,404
you might want to turn
that little toy of yours

354
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:35,073
to a higher setting.

355
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:38,910
Gladly.

356
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,411
(<i> screams</i> )

357
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:41,621
That's enough!

358
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,414
Whose side are you on?

359
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,291
There's a difference
between interrogation

360
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,375
and torture.

361
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,752
BASHIR:
The Alliance
never made

362
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:48,711
that distinction.

363
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,046
But you should.

364
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,384
Take her back to her cell.

365
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:03,392
Well done.

366
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,020
I have to admit,
the last time you were here

367
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,939
you had me completely fooled.

368
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:11,317
I really thought you were
<i>my</i> Benjamin Sisko.

369
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,152
That was the idea.

370
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,534
Help me escape

371
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:24,204
and I promise
I'll be grateful...

372
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,791
very grateful.

373
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,002
I'm sure
you would be

374
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:32,088
but don't count on it.

375
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:34,841
Well, then perhaps you'll find
Marani and have her sent

376
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,926
to my holding cell?
Marani?

377
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,011
One of my servants.

378
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,553
I am a touch sore

379
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:43,182
and she does give
the most exquisite massages.

380
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,767
(<i> laughing</i> )

381
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,024
A ship?

382
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:53,067
What kind of ship?

383
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,276
According
to our reports

384
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,320
it's of unknown classification

385
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,281
and carries
an impressive weapons array--

386
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,992
some kind of improved
photon torpedoes

387
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:04,620
multitargeting
phaser banks...

388
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,664
How long
until it is operational?

389
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,124
Within two days.

390
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,208
GARAK:
I know

391
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,835
it's none of my business

392
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,586
but perhaps it would be prudent

393
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,338
to increase our speed
to warp nine.

394
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,339
Quiet!

395
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,340
I was merely

396
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,217
trying to be of service.

397
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,344
If it was not
for your incompetence

398
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,346
the rebels would have
been destroyed.

399
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,973
I thought we'd agreed

400
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:26,266
that it was the<i> Intendant</i>
who was incompetent.

401
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,644
I was merely
following her orders.

402
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,647
And for following those orders,
you deserve to die.

403
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,357
Then why don't you kill me?

404
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,608
The Intendant

405
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,985
was bad enough.

406
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:38,738
She was irrational, accusatory,
unappreciative

407
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:39,822
but at least...

408
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,996
At least what?

409
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:49,623
At least...

410
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:54,336
I was able to please her,
now and then.

411
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,593
(<i> gagging</i> )

412
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:05,347
You are not my type.

413
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:08,976
I never said I was.

414
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:12,312
Increase speed
to warp nine.

415
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:19,820
So, what do you think?

416
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,031
It was delicious.

417
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,365
What do you call it?

418
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,243
Chicken à la Sisko.

419
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:28,579
How did you learn
to cook like this?

420
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:31,707
Well, uh, all Sisko men
have the cooking gene.

421
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,209
Oh.

422
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:35,753
Yeah, you should try my
father's shrimp creole.

423
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:37,213
(<i> sighs</i> )

424
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:38,839
Maybe one day I will.

425
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,007
(<i> chuckles</i> )

426
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,008
(<i> door chimes</i> )

427
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,051
Come in.

428
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:47,473
(sighs) Jake, it's time
to call it a day.

429
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:50,810
How about some
chicken à la Sisko?

430
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,394
Jake made dinner.

431
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,813
It's delicious.

432
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:56,107
I am too tired to eat.

433
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:58,109
Jake-o.
In a minute, Dad.

434
00:21:58,109 --> 00:21:59,277
I don't want
to leave a mess.

435
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:01,070
Oh, that's really
not necessary.

436
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,655
No, I want to.

437
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,715
How's the work
on the<i> Defiant</i> coming?

438
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,884
Slowly.

439
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,521
Does that feel better?

440
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:38,858
Yes, but I don't know what
you expect to gain by it.

441
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:39,900
I don't expect

442
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,902
to gain anything.

443
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:45,489
I just want to remind you
that I am not your enemy.

444
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,867
I don't know why you're
being so hard on me.

445
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,160
After all

446
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,287
<i>you</i> pretended to be my husband

447
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,579
and I've forgiven you.

448
00:22:55,916 --> 00:23:00,671
By the way, you have done
a good job with him.

449
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,424
Jake, I mean.

450
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:07,136
Well, you're not making
<i>that</i> job any easier.

451
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:10,056
Oh... he'll get over me.

452
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:11,015
Maybe.

453
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:13,809
I wish I could say the same.

454
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:19,315
Is that really a surprise?

455
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:21,525
Think about it.

456
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:24,362
My Ben Sisko is dead.

457
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:27,656
I look at Jake...

458
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:30,743
and all I see...

459
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:33,704
is the son
that I'll never have.

460
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,958
Maybe bringing him here

461
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,044
wasn't such a good idea
after all.

462
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,091
For any of us.

463
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:46,092
(<i> door chimes</i> )

464
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:47,176
Come in.

465
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:52,765
I've just got word.

466
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:55,268
The Alliance fleet is less
than eight hours away.

467
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:57,644
I guess we've run out of time.

468
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:12,576
SISKO:
You concentrate
on getting

469
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:13,869
the weapons array on-line.

470
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,038
I'll calibrate
the SIF generators.

471
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:18,540
Eight hours-- it's
not a lot of time, is it?

472
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,583
It's all we have.

473
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,918
BASHIR:
Smiley!

474
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:24,171
Your assembly crew

475
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,881
won't let me
into the torpedo bay.

476
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,633
That's because
they're trying

477
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:30,344
to get the torpedo chambering
mechanism on-line.

478
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:31,845
Oh, great.

479
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:34,556
So what am I supposed to do
with these torpedoes?!

480
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,225
I have a few suggestions.

481
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:38,227
Do you, now?

482
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:39,477
This isn't getting us anywhere.

483
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,188
We need to buy ourselves
some more time.

484
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,564
Any ideas?

485
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:43,774
How many raiders
have we got left?

486
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:45,359
Only one.

487
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:47,361
There's no way we can
stop the Alliance attack.

488
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:49,322
Maybe not, but I might
be able to buy more time

489
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:50,364
before they get here.

490
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:51,865
You'll never make it back.

491
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:54,576
Is that what you're
worried about?

492
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,120
I thought it was because

493
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,080
I was going to reap
all the glory.

494
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,874
What good is glory
when you're dead?

495
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,585
Who said anything
about dying?

496
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,503
When are...<i> we</i> leaving?

497
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:10,134
I never liked staying
in one place for very long.

498
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:13,762
Then...it's settled.

499
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,722
SISKO:
Before you go

500
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:19,852
we'd better make damn sure
you can get us that extra time.

501
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:24,064
Me help you
fight the Alliance...

502
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:28,152
what a perverse idea.

503
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:29,653
I have a better one.

504
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,529
Why don't I cut your throat?

505
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:33,907
Quick death--

506
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:37,286
<i>much</i> less painful than anything
the Regent will do to you.

507
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:40,747
I think you'd
better worry

508
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:43,667
about what the Regent
is going to do to<i> you.</i>

509
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,544
The Regent has no reason
to question my loyalty.

510
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:49,423
It's not your loyalty
he'll be questioning.

511
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:51,050
It's your effectiveness.

512
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:54,094
After all, he wouldn't have
to retake Terok Nor

513
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,346
if you hadn't lost it

514
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:56,596
in the first place.

515
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:58,140
<i>I</i> didn't lose anything.

516
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,018
It was Garak and the rest
of those Alliance fools.

517
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:02,978
Their excessive brutality--

518
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,105
I could never
make them understand

519
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:07,483
violence is
a precision instrument.

520
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:10,069
It's a scalpel, not a club.

521
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,321
Garak was smart enough
to escape.

522
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:13,739
Garak is a coward.

523
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:15,908
He ran at the first sign
of danger.

524
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:18,244
Probably straight
into the Regent's arms

525
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:20,120
where he, no doubt,
laid the blame

526
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,789
for the loss of this station
entirely on you.

527
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,002
You have a point.

528
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,337
Good.

529
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:30,381
Then I'll ask you again.

530
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:33,008
Is there any weakness
in the Alliance fleet

531
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,634
something we can exploit?

532
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:38,097
It's a possibility.

533
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:41,559
Why don't you lower
this force field

534
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:44,270
and join me in here?

535
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,773
It might help stimulate
my thought process.

536
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:50,067
I should think
self-preservation

537
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:52,528
would be stimulation
enough for you.

538
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:54,654
That's not
a very friendly attitude--

539
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:56,614
especially when you
want my help.

540
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:59,452
Oh.

541
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:01,661
It's Professor Sisko, isn't it?

542
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,956
Well, she's
very attractive

543
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,499
but I've known
Breen icicles

544
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:06,792
that are warmer
than she is.

545
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:09,587
This has nothing to do with her.

546
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:11,547
If you say so.

547
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:14,258
Still...

548
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:18,220
I've never been able to resist
anyone named Benjamin Sisko.

549
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:22,724
The Alliance ships
are quick and powerful

550
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,851
but they do have one weakness--

551
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:27,687
their targeting systems
can be fooled.

552
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:30,857
They've been known
to chase warp shadows.

553
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,446
How do I know I can believe you?

554
00:27:35,446 --> 00:27:38,198
You're just going
to have to trust me.

555
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:47,124
(<i> grunting</i> )

556
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:55,633
The key-- where is it?

557
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:56,883
You're not listening.

558
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,885
I didn't take the key.

559
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,971
(<i> groaning</i> )

560
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:03,474
You are lying.
KLINGON:
I'm telling you,

561
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:06,018
he stole it from me
while I was feeding him!

562
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:10,272
Don't make me
ask you again.

563
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,943
What good would the key do me?

564
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,654
Even if I<i> were</i> to
unlock this collar

565
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:17,904
where could I go?

566
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:20,366
I can't get off this ship

567
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:24,119
and besides, you've searched me
three times already.

568
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,539
Where could I possibly
be hiding it?

569
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:28,415
Perhaps you swallowed it.

570
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:29,791
Impossible!

571
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:32,169
I'm very particular
about what I eat.

572
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:37,049
We will see about that.

573
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:40,386
Regent!

574
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:41,470
What is it?!

575
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,722
The... key, sir.

576
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,350
Somehow it fell into...

577
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,143
my boot.

578
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,604
Now do you believe me?

579
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:53,357
(<i> gasps</i> )

580
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:01,031
If he dies, you die.

(<i> console beeping</i> )

582
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,623
Six rebel raiders
are approaching

583
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:12,376
bearing 354 mark 008.

584
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:14,294
Their sensors have detected us.

585
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:15,754
They're fleeing.

586
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,716
Wise choice

587
00:29:18,716 --> 00:29:21,968
but they will not get far.

588
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,470
I hope these warp shadows
we're emitting

589
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,846
are going to fool them.

590
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,974
We'll know as soon
as they start firing.

591
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,664
(<i> sighing</i> )

592
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:55,210
You look like you could use
another pair of hands.

593
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,463
Smaller ones might help.

594
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:59,423
Here.

595
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:01,300
Let me.

596
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,969
I'm trying to recalibrate
the torque sensors.

597
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:05,137
Yes, I know.

598
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:08,056
To control the inertial dampers.

599
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:10,643
It's<i> Professor</i> Sisko, remember?

600
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:11,685
Sorry.

601
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:13,186
For what it's worth

602
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:16,440
you should know that
I've told Jake the truth

603
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,026
about my visit to you,
why I brought him here

604
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,027
everything.

605
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,529
And?

606
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:25,491
And he said that
it doesn't matter--

607
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:27,701
that he's still glad
to have met me.

608
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:30,078
Funny thing is,
I know he means it.

609
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,581
He has a forgiving nature.

610
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:35,417
Mmm. It's more than that.

611
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:38,837
I don't think he could be angry
with me even if he wanted to.

612
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,840
I remind him too much
of his mother.

613
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,427
He loved her very much.

614
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:48,806
No one has ever cared about me
like that before.

615
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:54,353
So...

616
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:57,564
if it's all right with you,
I will see to it

617
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:00,025
that he is sent back
to Deep Space 9.

618
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,067
When?

619
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,402
Right away.

620
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,697
What's Smiley going
to say about that?

621
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:06,990
He trusts you
to finish your job.

622
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,659
And...

623
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:09,827
so do I.

624
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,749
Would you...
like to say good-bye to him?

625
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:18,084
I'd better finish here.

626
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:21,296
Uh, tell Jake
I'll see him soon.

627
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,509
Ben?

628
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,929
When we first met,
there was a...

629
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:33,058
a connection between us

630
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:36,061
and now,
because of what I've done

631
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:38,731
it's gone, isn't it?

632
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:42,150
I'm not sure it was real
to begin with.

633
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:53,161
I better go get Jake home.

634
00:32:15,893 --> 00:32:17,519
NOG:
Hey!

635
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,271
What are you doing there?
Nothing.

636
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:20,689
I'm just thinking.
Well, think
somewhere else--

637
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:22,148
you're making me
uncomfortable.

638
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:24,818
(<i> laughs</i> )
What's so funny?

639
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:27,446
Where I come from, it's you
and I that would hang out here

640
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:29,573
and it's your uncle
that would chase us away.

641
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:31,533
Hey, am I supposed
to be impressed by that?

642
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:34,119
I don't care about
some parallel universe.

643
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,829
I only care about this one.

644
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:37,122
And in this one, I run a bar

645
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:38,998
and you do your thinking
in your quarters.

646
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:42,043
All right.
You made your point.

647
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,253
I'm waiting.

648
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:44,755
I'm going.
Good.

649
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:47,633
You're a long way
from home,<i> hu-man.</i>

650
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:49,843
I guess I am.

651
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:51,303
JENNIFER:
Jake?

652
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,346
I need to speak with you.

653
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:54,556
In private.

654
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:56,975
Sure.

655
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:17,830
Tell me something.

656
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:20,373
Are you as bored
as I am?

657
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:26,630
I'll take that as a "yes."

658
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:30,634
You know, I bet if we put our...

659
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:32,761
heads together

660
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:35,806
we could create a little
excitement for ourselves.

661
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:38,976
You sentenced my wife to death.

662
00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:41,770
Isn't that a coincidence?

663
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,981
I was hoping
you weren't married.

664
00:33:43,981 --> 00:33:46,191
I've prepared
the Intendant's dinner.

665
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:47,400
Show me.

666
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:05,794
Nicely done.

667
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:07,045
Thank you.

668
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,547
I have a ship
waiting for you

669
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:09,882
at Landing Pad C.

670
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:11,341
I'm going to need that
more than you will.

671
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:13,844
I wasn't aware we were
on the same side.

672
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:16,513
You killed my father
<i>and</i> my uncle.

673
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:18,974
Thanks to you,
I own the bar.

674

the docking scaffold.

678
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:40,954
Captain.

679
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:42,539
I think it's time
for you to go.

680
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:44,249
I believe that was
the agreement.

681
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:45,333
I'm on my way.

682
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,418
Just wanted
to wish you luck.

683
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:47,586
Thanks.

684
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:48,962
You've given us
a fine ship.

685
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,882
I only wish

686
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:53,425
I could have gotten
to know her better

687
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,301
before taking her
into battle.

688
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:56,720
Still, there's
nothing like

689
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,430
a little
on-the-job training

690
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,432
to get the adrenaline
pumping.

691
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,436
Get out of that chair,
Smiley.

692
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:05,478
What do you mean?

693
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:06,646
Just do it.

694
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:08,607
Seal the airlock.

695
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:09,858
Release docking clamps.

696
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:11,443
Aft thrusters at
one-quarter impulse.

697
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:14,195
What are you standing
there for, Smiley?

698
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:16,656
Captain, you never
cease to amaze me.

699
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:19,034
Sometimes
I even surprise myself.

700
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,913
How long do you think
the station's shields

701
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:24,664
can withstand
the Alliance assault?

702
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:25,874
Long enough for us
to see how tough

703
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:27,166
this ship of yours
really is.

704
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,919
Let's find out.
Take us out of here.

705
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:31,463
You're sure you want
to leave now?

706
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:34,340
I'm hoping this
new rebel ship

707
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,384
keeps the Alliance busy
while I get to Bajor.

708
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,970
I have friends there
who will hide me.

709
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,345
Well, don't worry
about me.

710
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:41,056
I won't tell anyone
where you are.

711
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:42,975
(<i> laughs</i> )

712
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:48,146

(<i> yells</i> )

714
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:53,318
You're right.

715
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:55,070
You won't tell anyone.

716
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,447
(<i> sighing</i> )

717
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,910
I don't see why
you can't come

718
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,411
to Deep Space 9
with me.

719
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,830
Believe me, Jake,
it's better

720
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:05,872
in the long run
if I don't

721
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:06,873
for all of us.

722
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,207
Jennifer.

723
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:11,086
You look as beautiful as ever.

724
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:39,572
A bird-of-prey
is locked on to us.

725
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,783
Evasive maneuvers,
pattern delta.

726
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:44,995
Pattern delta--
what's that?

727
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:46,579
Rock her.
Rock her?

728
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,914
Port to starboard, hard.

729
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:48,999
Got it.

730
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,380
Can't lose her.
Hard to port.

731
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:08,894
Fire!

732
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,611
I must remember that one.

733
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,366
You know, I really have
to thank you, Jennifer.

734
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:27,996
Not only do you guarantee me
safe passage off this station

735
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:30,916
but you make the perfect gift
for the Regent as well.

736
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:33,292
You want me to go with you?
Fine.

737
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:34,920
But leave the boy here.

738
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,925
Why is he so important to you?

739
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:41,384
That doesn't matter.

740
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,220
You're<i> not</i> taking him.

741
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:46,347
I've never seen you
so passionate.

742
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,933
It gives you a lovely glow.

743
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:51,644
All right.

744
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,563
He doesn't have to come.

745
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:54,647
No!

746
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:55,941
(<i> yells</i> )

747
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,611
Well, that was unfortunate.

748
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,571
She needs a doctor.

749
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:03,448
Mmm...

750
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:05,200
I'm afraid it's too late...

751
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,035
for both of you.

752
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:12,457
Just out of curiosity...

753
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,960
why was she protecting you?

754
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:21,800
She's my mother.

755
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,010
INTENDANT:
Your mother?

756
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:27,055
You're Sisko's son.

757
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:28,473
From the other side?

758
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:33,270
Well, in that case...

759
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:35,730
give your father
a message from me.

760
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,108
Tell him I spared your life.

761
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:40,235
That's a debt
I intend to collect.

762
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:49,995
Shields are down
to 40 percent.

763
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:51,288
That cruiser has us
in weapons range.

764
00:38:51,288 --> 00:38:52,413
Do we make
a run for it?

765
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:55,333
We run all right-- right at it.

766
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,252
Ah... pattern suicide.

767
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,759
Concentrate your fire
on that ship.

768
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:05,885
It's changing course.

769
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,262
It's headed directly
toward us.

770
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:09,472
Good. That should
make things easier.

771
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:12,267
Terok Nor will soon
be ours again.

772
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,854
Then you can spend
the rest of your life

773
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:17,605
contemplating your failure

774
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,607
as you labor
alongside the other slaves

775
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,318
in the ore
processing center.

776
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:23,569
It's nice to have something
to look forward to.

777
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,619
Shields down to 25 percent.

778
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,371
One more hit
could finish us.

779
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,123
Then we'll have to make
sure we don't get hit.

780
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:37,792
I'll take the helm.
Nothing personal--

781
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,336
I just know this ship
better than you.

782
00:39:39,336 --> 00:39:41,129
She's all yours.

783
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:44,174
Hold on!

784
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,326
(<i> yells</i> )

785
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:13,953
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

786
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,916
I want that ship destroyed now!

787
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:19,167
They're flying too close.

788
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:20,335
I can't target them.

789
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:24,505
We put a hole
in their forward shields.

790
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,341
Nice shooting, Smiley.

791
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:27,550
Hold on.

792
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,552
A bird-of-prey
just locked on to us.

793
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:32,013
Secondary power to aft shields.

794
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,890
What secondary power?
You got to get us out of here.

795
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:36,684
We can't risk giving the cruiser
a clear shot.

796
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,311
I was just starting
to like this ship.

797
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,441
Yeah!

798
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:52,075
Bashir to<i> Defiant.</i> 
Aren't you going
to welcome me back?

799
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:54,369
I never thought I'd be happy
to hear your voice.

800
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:55,536
You'll get over it.

801
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,038
Sisko to Bashir.

802
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:59,958
Concentrate your fire
on their forward shields.

803
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,459
BASHIR:
With pleasure.

804
00:41:11,428 --> 00:41:13,305
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

805
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:15,265
(<i> yelling</i> )

806
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:21,229
Forgive me, my Regent

807
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:23,189
but perhaps
the moment has arrived

808
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:25,483
to remove your august presence
from the battlefield.

809
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,277
You mean retreat.

810
00:41:27,277 --> 00:41:29,154
I hope I'm not out of line.

811
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,451
The cruiser's changing course.

812
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:35,660
They're going to warp.

813
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,083
The other Alliance ships

814
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,085
have broken off their attack
on the station.

815
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:46,296
We've won.

816
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:47,380
You sound surprised.

817
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,465
Surprised?

818
00:41:48,465 --> 00:41:50,091
I'm astonished.

819
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:52,218
Not that I'm complaining.

820
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,303
(<i> chuckles</i> )

821
00:41:53,303 --> 00:41:55,221
I have been betrayed!

822
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:57,223
(<i> choking</i> )

823
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,892
There can be no other
explanation for my defeat.

824
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:02,103
I certainly
can't think of any.

825
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:05,440
The traitor must be
found and punished.

826
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,150
She will.

827
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:10,320
It<i> is</i> the Intendant we're
talking about, isn't it?

828
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,906
The Intendant.

829
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:16,284
Of course.

830
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:21,039
All I ask is
that when the moment comes

831
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,666
that you allow me,
your humble servant

832
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:26,461
the honor of administering
her punishment.

833
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:27,962
I promise you

834
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:33,051
she will regret her disloyalty
before she dies.

835
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:35,636
And while you dispose
of the Intendant

836
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:40,141
I will dispose
of the rebels.

837
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:42,935
Make it so.

838
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:43,978
(<i> grunts</i> )

839
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:01,913
Dad...

840
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:03,581
See? I told you he'd come.

841
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,753
How is she?

842
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:22,434
Ben...

843
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:23,809
Easy.

844
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,903
I knew we were still connected.

845
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:36,155
Always.

846
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,807
Dad...

847
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:20,658
(<i> whispering</i> ):
Let's go home.
