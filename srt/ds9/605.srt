1
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:10,412
Cadet.

2
00:00:10,452 --> 00:00:12,423
Continuing to emit
distress signals

3
00:00:12,457 --> 00:00:13,858
on all frequencies, sir.

4
00:00:13,894 --> 00:00:15,363
Chief.

5
00:00:15,399 --> 00:00:16,925
We're still venting plasma.

6
00:00:16,969 --> 00:00:19,065
Any ship
within 100 million kilometers

7
00:00:19,108 --> 00:00:20,202
will know we're here...

8
00:00:20,277 --> 00:00:22,214
and that we're not going
anywhere.

9
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,688
We have company, Captain.

10
00:00:24,722 --> 00:00:26,590
Two Dominion ships
heading this way

11
00:00:26,628 --> 00:00:29,568
bearing 197 mark 135.

12
00:00:29,601 --> 00:00:32,005
They'll have us in weapons range
in 22 seconds.

13
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:32,838
Shields?

14
00:00:32,877 --> 00:00:34,107
Shields at 30 percent.

15
00:00:34,147 --> 00:00:35,046
Phaser banks?

16
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:37,020
The entire weapons array
is off-line.

17
00:00:37,054 --> 00:00:40,119
Now we find something
to hold onto.

18
00:00:46,345 --> 00:00:48,579
Shields are down to 20 percent.

19
00:00:57,708 --> 00:00:58,802
Now?

20
00:00:58,844 --> 00:01:02,479
Now. Shields up,
engines at full impulse.

21
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:03,420
Power to main phasers.

22
00:01:03,456 --> 00:01:04,516
Target locked.

23
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:05,858
Fire!

24
00:01:11,042 --> 00:01:13,104
Cadet, are there any other
Dominion ships out there?

25
00:01:13,148 --> 00:01:15,142
None that I can see.

26
00:01:15,187 --> 00:01:17,557
This is the Captain speaking.

27
00:01:17,593 --> 00:01:19,621
All hands, stand down.

28
00:01:19,665 --> 00:01:21,134
Good job, people.

29
00:01:22,238 --> 00:01:23,537
We're being hailed
by the <i>Rotarran.</i>

30
00:01:23,576 --> 00:01:25,308
Commander Worf
wants to speak to you.

31
00:01:25,413 --> 00:01:27,077
On screen.

32
00:01:27,117 --> 00:01:29,749
Well done, Captain.

33
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:32,320
You were a very effective decoy.

34
00:01:32,365 --> 00:01:34,268
How about next time
we switch roles?

35
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:35,772
That way, I can rescue you.

36
00:01:35,807 --> 00:01:37,778
You may have to wait awhile,
Captain.

37
00:01:37,812 --> 00:01:40,945
We've just received orders
from Starfleet Command.

38
00:01:40,987 --> 00:01:45,522
All ships in this sector to
pull back to Starbase 375.

39
00:01:45,566 --> 00:01:46,865
Fall back again.

40
00:01:46,903 --> 00:01:48,840
Engage, retreat.
Engage, retreat.

41
00:01:48,874 --> 00:01:51,642
I tell you, that's becoming
our favorite tune.

42
00:01:51,681 --> 00:01:53,150
Well, we better think
of a new tune fast

43
00:01:53,185 --> 00:01:54,745
or the only song
we're going to be singing

44
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:56,053
is "Hail
the Conquering Dominion."

45
00:01:56,092 --> 00:01:58,964
I wouldn't start learning
those lyrics just yet, Doctor.

46
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,236
Worf, we'll see you
at Starbase 375.

47
00:02:02,275 --> 00:02:04,041
I will be waiting.

48
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,978
Set a course
for these coordinates.

49
00:02:07,021 --> 00:02:09,015
Warp seven.

50
00:02:16,981 --> 00:02:19,077
I don't know
what all you brass hats

51
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:21,090
in Starfleet Command
are thinking

52
00:02:21,124 --> 00:02:23,562
but take it
from a simple field officer...

53
00:02:23,597 --> 00:02:27,403
we're not going to win this war
by running away from the enemy.

54
00:02:27,441 --> 00:02:28,410
I know that.

55
00:02:28,477 --> 00:02:31,383
Benjamin, troop morale
is at an all-time low.

56
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:33,822
Even the Klingons
are starting to wonder

57
00:02:33,858 --> 00:02:36,353
if we can defeat the Dominion.

58
00:02:36,398 --> 00:02:39,030
We need a victory...
a big victory...

59
00:02:39,071 --> 00:02:40,871
and we need it soon.

60
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:42,846
I couldn't agree with you more.

61
00:02:44,752 --> 00:02:46,882
Then do something about it.

62
00:02:46,925 --> 00:02:48,589
I already have.

63
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:50,395
In fact, I'm presenting a plan

64
00:02:50,434 --> 00:02:52,906
to Starfleet Command
at 0800 tomorrow.

65
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,139
What plan?

66
00:02:59,391 --> 00:03:03,333
We're going to retake
Deep Space 9.

67
00:05:05,896 --> 00:05:08,768
Everything appears
to be perfectly normal.

68
00:05:08,803 --> 00:05:09,931
I'm sorry, Garak.

69
00:05:09,972 --> 00:05:11,271
Well, keep looking, Doctor.

70
00:05:11,309 --> 00:05:15,149
Whatever Starfleet put in there
is very well-hidden.

71
00:05:15,186 --> 00:05:16,155
Ridiculous.

72
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:17,590
Well, that's easy
for you to say, Chief.

73
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,562
You don't know them
as well as I do.

74
00:05:19,598 --> 00:05:20,965
These are desperate people.

75
00:05:21,001 --> 00:05:23,473
Garak, you're not going
to get any of us to believe

76
00:05:23,508 --> 00:05:25,138
that Starfleet Intelligence

77
00:05:25,178 --> 00:05:27,878
has implanted some kind
of neural transponder

78
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,255
in your brain
to monitor your thoughts.

79
00:05:30,292 --> 00:05:31,852
I would have if I were them.

80
00:05:31,896 --> 00:05:34,232
In fact, when I was
conducting interrogations

81
00:05:34,269 --> 00:05:37,071
for the Obsidian Order,
I did a lot worse.

82
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,409
I'm sure you did.

83
00:05:38,447 --> 00:05:40,715
They are not interrogating
you, Mr. Garak...

84
00:05:40,752 --> 00:05:41,778
they are debriefing.

85
00:05:41,822 --> 00:05:42,950
There is a difference.

86
00:05:42,992 --> 00:05:44,518
Not from where I'm sitting.

87
00:05:44,562 --> 00:05:46,430
Oh, I'll have
a <i>raktajino,</i> Julian.

88
00:05:46,467 --> 00:05:47,868
And a <i>raktajino.</i>

89
00:05:47,905 --> 00:05:51,038
Look, Garak,
we are at war with the Dominion.

90
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,743
Cardassia is part
of the Dominion.

91
00:05:52,784 --> 00:05:54,117
You are a Cardassian

92
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:56,057
and, at one time, you were
a fairly important one.

93
00:05:56,092 --> 00:05:57,790
Of course
Starfleet Intelligence

94
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,356
is going to press you
for specifics.

95
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,463
They need to know
everything you know.

96
00:06:01,506 --> 00:06:03,944
Any small detail
could prove extremely important.

97
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:05,448
Well, take it from me...

98
00:06:05,483 --> 00:06:07,682
it's a lot more fun
asking questions

99
00:06:07,722 --> 00:06:09,352
than answering them.

100
00:06:09,393 --> 00:06:11,261
All things considered

101
00:06:11,298 --> 00:06:14,865
I'd rather be on the <i>Defiant</i>
with all of you.

102
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:16,538
Oh, believe me, you
haven't been missing much.

103
00:06:16,646 --> 00:06:18,549
Hopefully, all of that's
about to change.

104
00:06:18,651 --> 00:06:21,317
Do you think Starfleet Command
will approve Sisko's plan?

105
00:06:21,358 --> 00:06:23,557
Well, we'll find out
soon enough.

106
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:26,229
He's in there
presenting it right now.

107
00:06:26,271 --> 00:06:28,367
Here's to retaking the castle.

108
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:32,682
And planting our flag
on its battlements once again.

109
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,922
You two have spent too much time
in the holosuites.

110
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:37,934
By putting together
a task force comprised

111
00:06:37,968 --> 00:06:40,270
of elements of the Second,
Fifth and Ninth Fleets

112
00:06:40,307 --> 00:06:42,073
I believe we can retake
Deep Space 9...

113
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:43,945
the most important piece
of real estate

114
00:06:43,983 --> 00:06:45,043
in the Alpha Quadrant.

115
00:06:45,086 --> 00:06:47,854
Your plan, Captain Sisko,
is not without merit.

116
00:06:47,894 --> 00:06:49,524
However, I remain skeptical.

117
00:06:49,564 --> 00:06:54,065
The Dominion will undoubtedly
send a large fleet to stop you.

118
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,443
And it will divert their forces

119
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,576
and slow their advance
into Federation territory.

120
00:06:57,618 --> 00:06:58,985
As well as leave
their flank vulnerable.

121
00:06:59,022 --> 00:07:00,150
Which will give us a chance

122
00:07:00,192 --> 00:07:01,718
to be on the offensive
for a change.

123
00:07:01,763 --> 00:07:03,597
There's one thing
that still concerns me.

124
00:07:03,668 --> 00:07:04,932
What's that, Admiral?

125
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:06,270
Earth.

126
00:07:06,308 --> 00:07:09,441
You've left it
a very tempting target.

127
00:07:09,483 --> 00:07:11,955
Earth will still be defended
by the Third Fleet.

128
00:07:11,989 --> 00:07:13,253
But what if you're wrong

129
00:07:13,292 --> 00:07:15,560
and the Dominion
doesn't commit its forces

130
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,091
to protect Deep Space 9?

131
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:20,440
What if, instead, they launch
a full-scale assault on Earth?

132
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:23,246
If we follow the plan
you're proposing

133
00:07:23,285 --> 00:07:24,515
we'll never be able

134
00:07:24,555 --> 00:07:26,891
to get reinforcements
there in time.

135
00:07:26,928 --> 00:07:29,366
The Dominion won't attack Earth.

136
00:07:29,401 --> 00:07:30,802
How can you be sure?

137
00:07:30,838 --> 00:07:33,812
Because Earth isn't the key
to the Alpha Quadrant...

138
00:07:33,846 --> 00:07:34,974
the wormhole is.

139
00:07:35,016 --> 00:07:37,215
And whoever controls
Deep Space 9

140
00:07:37,254 --> 00:07:39,248
controls the wormhole.

141
00:07:47,815 --> 00:07:49,615
Unbelievable.

142
00:07:49,653 --> 00:07:51,955
Amazing.

143
00:07:51,993 --> 00:07:54,192
What nerve.

144
00:07:54,233 --> 00:07:55,931
Morn, you do have a problem

145
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,602
but lucky for you,
the solution is simple.

146
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:01,242
You're a grown man,
and if you don't want

147
00:08:01,284 --> 00:08:03,620
to attend your mother's
birthday party

148
00:08:03,657 --> 00:08:05,321
you don't have to.

149
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:09,404
And if she keeps
whining about it

150
00:08:09,438 --> 00:08:11,808
just remind her there's a war on

151
00:08:11,845 --> 00:08:14,181
and you have things to do.

152
00:08:14,217 --> 00:08:16,211
Another ale?

153
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,602
Um... uh...

154
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,439
here, uh...

155
00:08:24,477 --> 00:08:25,946
it's on the house.

156
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,001
Major, you ready?

157
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,009
Now?

158
00:08:37,043 --> 00:08:38,103
Right now.

159
00:08:38,146 --> 00:08:40,550
All right, but I don't think
it'll do any good.

160
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:41,885
I keep telling myself

161
00:08:41,923 --> 00:08:44,225
that Odo never meant
to have Rom arrested.

162
00:08:44,261 --> 00:08:45,560
It was all a mistake...

163
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:47,229
bad timing, bad luck.

164
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:49,206
I thought that, too, at first.

165
00:08:49,241 --> 00:08:51,805
I have known Odo a long time.

166
00:08:51,915 --> 00:08:53,818
He's not a collaborator.

167
00:08:53,854 --> 00:08:56,258
Then why is your brother
still in a holding cell?

168
00:08:59,502 --> 00:09:01,302
We're here to see Odo.

169
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,539
The Founders are
not to be disturbed.

170
00:09:03,578 --> 00:09:05,982
Odo will make
an exception for us.

171
00:09:06,018 --> 00:09:08,114
There are no exceptions.

172
00:09:08,158 --> 00:09:10,460
I'd like to hear that from Odo.

173
00:09:10,496 --> 00:09:12,798
I'm sorry, Major,
but you're wasting your time.

174
00:09:12,836 --> 00:09:14,237
His orders were quite clear.

175
00:09:14,273 --> 00:09:15,799
He doesn't want to see anyone...

176
00:09:15,844 --> 00:09:17,313
not until his guest has left.

177
00:09:17,347 --> 00:09:19,477
And how long has his guest
been visiting?

178
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,322
As far as I know,
the female changeling

179
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,456
has not left his quarters
for three days.

180
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,833
Step away from the door,
Ferengi!

181
00:09:25,903 --> 00:09:27,703
Hey, hey!

182
00:09:27,742 --> 00:09:29,645
Perhaps it would be best
if you left.

183
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,848
My colleague here
takes his duties very seriously.

184
00:09:32,888 --> 00:09:35,656
I promise to tell Odo
you were here.

185
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:39,396
Let's go, Quark.

186
00:09:47,794 --> 00:09:50,062
So...

187
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,008
that is how the solids
experience intimacy.

188
00:09:55,981 --> 00:09:58,317
Not all solids.

189
00:09:58,354 --> 00:10:01,658
Humans... Bajorans...

190
00:10:01,696 --> 00:10:03,826
I really must thank you, Odo.

191
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,065
For what?

192
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:09,208
For giving me
new insight into the solids.

193
00:10:09,249 --> 00:10:11,721
And what have you learned?

194
00:10:11,755 --> 00:10:15,697
That what they consider intimacy
is only a shadow

195
00:10:15,733 --> 00:10:19,003
of what we experience
in the Great Link.

196
00:10:21,548 --> 00:10:23,246
You don't agree?

197
00:10:24,756 --> 00:10:27,456
I didn't say that.

198
00:10:27,496 --> 00:10:30,937
You have done this before?

199
00:10:30,972 --> 00:10:32,704
Not often.

200
00:10:32,744 --> 00:10:35,410
But when you have,
you enjoyed it?

201
00:10:37,355 --> 00:10:38,790
Yes.

202
00:10:38,825 --> 00:10:39,953
And you regret

203
00:10:39,995 --> 00:10:43,163
not having experienced it
with Major Kira?

204
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:48,581
I'd rather not
discuss Major Kira.

205
00:10:48,618 --> 00:10:50,486
I don't see why not.

206
00:10:50,523 --> 00:10:51,651
When we link

207
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:55,726
your feelings for her
are made very clear.

208
00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:00,647
Then why do you insist
that we talk about it?

209
00:11:00,682 --> 00:11:04,785
Because talking is still
very important to you.

210
00:11:04,827 --> 00:11:07,026
But one day, it won't be.

211
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:10,268
One day, the Link
will be all that you need

212
00:11:10,308 --> 00:11:11,979
and that day is coming soon.

213
00:11:13,014 --> 00:11:14,040
Is it?

214
00:11:14,084 --> 00:11:15,383
It's amazing

215
00:11:15,421 --> 00:11:18,155
that you have survived
this long without it.

216
00:11:18,194 --> 00:11:19,424
It's only now

217
00:11:19,464 --> 00:11:22,438
after I have been away
from the Great Link myself

218
00:11:22,472 --> 00:11:26,745
that I understand how painful
it must have been for you.

219
00:11:26,783 --> 00:11:29,483
It hasn't always been easy.

220
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:33,363
Odo, you never have
to be alone again.

221
00:11:37,745 --> 00:11:39,716
Well...

222
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,151
I'd better be going.

223
00:11:41,187 --> 00:11:44,355
There's a meeting
of the station's Ruling Council.

224
00:11:44,395 --> 00:11:46,594
Dukat and Weyoun
are expecting me.

225
00:11:46,668 --> 00:11:49,004
That meeting was held
three days ago.

226
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:52,874
Three days?

227
00:11:55,391 --> 00:11:57,385
Three days.

228
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:03,372
How could I have lost track
of that much time?

229
00:12:03,412 --> 00:12:05,406
Does that bother you?

230
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,761
Yes, it does.

231
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:11,823
Well, don't let it.

232
00:12:11,867 --> 00:12:15,171
You've been living
with the solids' concept of time

233
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:17,373
for too long.

234
00:12:17,415 --> 00:12:19,579
Let them worry
about their meetings

235
00:12:19,621 --> 00:12:21,820
their schedules,
their obligations.

236
00:12:21,859 --> 00:12:24,799
None of that
has anything to do with you.

237
00:12:24,834 --> 00:12:27,363
You are a changeling.

238
00:12:27,407 --> 00:12:29,401
You are timeless.

239
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:33,746
As am I.

240
00:13:25,558 --> 00:13:27,722
You asked to see me, Major?

241
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,129
That's right. L...

242
00:13:29,168 --> 00:13:31,139
First, tell me something.

243
00:13:31,173 --> 00:13:33,941
What do you think of this?

244
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,746
It's one of Ziyal's paintings.

245
00:13:35,785 --> 00:13:37,277
I know who the artist is.

246
00:13:37,322 --> 00:13:38,882
Her father gave it to me.

247
00:13:38,926 --> 00:13:41,991
He claims it won some sort
of prize on Cardassia.

248
00:13:42,034 --> 00:13:43,868
Gul Dukat must be very proud...

249
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:44,875
I suppose.

250
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:46,903
Is it...

251
00:13:48,752 --> 00:13:50,221
any good?

252
00:13:50,255 --> 00:13:51,987
I think so.
Why, don't you?

253
00:13:52,027 --> 00:13:54,329
I don't know how to judge it.

254
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:58,969
You see, my people
lack a sense of aesthetics.

255
00:13:59,011 --> 00:13:59,980
That's too bad.

256
00:14:00,014 --> 00:14:01,917
I sometimes think so as well.

257
00:14:01,953 --> 00:14:04,687
But if aesthetics
were truly important

258
00:14:04,726 --> 00:14:06,594
the Founders
would have included it

259
00:14:06,631 --> 00:14:07,861
in our genetic makeup.

260
00:14:07,901 --> 00:14:10,203
Or... they made a mistake.

261
00:14:10,241 --> 00:14:13,443
Gods don't make mistakes.

262
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,754
Though... sometimes...

263
00:14:21,771 --> 00:14:25,474
I think it would be nice
to be able to carry a tune.

264
00:14:29,624 --> 00:14:32,096
So...

265
00:14:32,131 --> 00:14:33,395
what can I do for you, Major?

266
00:14:33,434 --> 00:14:34,403
It's about Rom.

267
00:14:34,437 --> 00:14:36,408
Oh, yes.

268
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,413
The Ferengi saboteur.

269
00:14:38,447 --> 00:14:41,079
He has been in a holding cell
for over a week.

270
00:14:41,121 --> 00:14:43,149
Has it really been that long?

271
00:14:43,193 --> 00:14:44,492
And I was hoping

272
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,832
that you would consider
releasing him.

273
00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:47,838
Impossible.

274
00:14:47,871 --> 00:14:49,865
You can't release a man
and then execute him.

275
00:14:49,978 --> 00:14:50,877
It makes no sense.

276
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,883
Execute Rom?

277
00:14:52,985 --> 00:14:57,224
He committed an act of terrorism
against the Dominion.

278
00:14:57,262 --> 00:15:01,102
Not only did he try to
interfere with our efforts

279
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,202
to take down the minefield

280
00:15:03,245 --> 00:15:05,843
but, as I understand
it, he's also

281
00:15:05,918 --> 00:15:08,686
the diabolical genius
who came up with the idea

282
00:15:08,726 --> 00:15:11,598
of self-replicating mines
in the first place.

283
00:15:11,633 --> 00:15:13,661
I'm afraid there's
no getting around it, Major.

284
00:15:13,706 --> 00:15:16,646
He must be made an example,
so that others think twice

285
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,081
before they act against us.

286
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:20,419
He is married
to a Bajoran citizen.

287
00:15:20,456 --> 00:15:21,755
I'm well aware of that

288
00:15:21,794 --> 00:15:24,062
and I'm willing to believe...
for now...

289
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:26,036
his wife is not
a coconspirator.

290
00:15:26,071 --> 00:15:27,905
Otherwise, treaty or no treaty,
she would share

291
00:15:27,942 --> 00:15:30,471
her husband's fate.

292
00:15:30,515 --> 00:15:32,247
I'm sorry, Major.

293
00:15:32,287 --> 00:15:35,523
The Dominion takes a dim view
of terrorism.

294
00:15:35,563 --> 00:15:38,935
Your... friend...

295
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,500
must pay the price
for his crime.

296
00:15:41,544 --> 00:15:44,073
We'll see what
the Bajoran government

297
00:15:44,118 --> 00:15:45,087
has to say about that.

298
00:15:45,121 --> 00:15:46,090
I'm afraid

299
00:15:46,123 --> 00:15:49,063
their pleas
will fall on deaf ears.

300
00:15:49,097 --> 00:15:50,589
Major.

301
00:15:52,607 --> 00:15:55,375
Would this be
more aesthetically pleasing

302
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,213
if it were blue?

303
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:07,474
I'm going to die.

304
00:16:07,512 --> 00:16:08,481
Stop saying that.

305
00:16:08,514 --> 00:16:09,483
I didn't say it...

306
00:16:09,517 --> 00:16:10,543
he did.

307
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:11,885
What I said is

308
00:16:11,924 --> 00:16:14,123
they're planning to execute you.

309
00:16:14,162 --> 00:16:15,826
It's not the same thing.

310
00:16:15,867 --> 00:16:17,701
It is to me.

311
00:16:17,738 --> 00:16:19,972
Rom, we are not going
to let them hurt you.

312
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:21,206
Kira has gone

313
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,184
to the Bajoran Council
of Ministers.

314
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,818
She's asking them
to lodge an official protest.

315
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,162
That's sweet, but I doubt
it'll do any good.

316
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:30,728
And I've talked
to Grand Nagus Zek himself

317
00:16:30,772 --> 00:16:32,606
and he has offered to buy
your freedom

318
00:16:32,644 --> 00:16:34,011
from the Dominion.

319
00:16:34,114 --> 00:16:36,712
I don't think Weyoun
cares much for latinum.

320
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:40,123
I'm a dead man.

321
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:46,271
Will you stop upsetting Leeta?

322
00:16:46,313 --> 00:16:47,680
Sorry.

323
00:16:48,886 --> 00:16:50,185
Besides...

324
00:16:50,223 --> 00:16:51,818
you think your big brother

325
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,854
will let anything
happen to you?

326
00:16:53,899 --> 00:16:55,368
What can you do?

327
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:58,675
I'm not sure

328
00:16:58,711 --> 00:17:01,583
but I will think of something.

329
00:17:05,763 --> 00:17:08,463
No matter what it takes...

330
00:17:08,503 --> 00:17:11,671
no matter what I have to do

331
00:17:11,712 --> 00:17:13,683
I'm going to get
you out of here.

332
00:17:13,717 --> 00:17:15,243
You do that

333
00:17:15,288 --> 00:17:18,991
and... I'll work
your dabo tables for free.

334
00:17:19,031 --> 00:17:19,760
For how long?

335
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,268
An entire year.

336
00:17:21,303 --> 00:17:22,168
Make it two.

337
00:17:22,206 --> 00:17:22,764
Brother!

338
00:17:22,807 --> 00:17:23,833
Shh!

339
00:17:27,854 --> 00:17:30,452
Isn't your life worth two years?

340
00:17:31,998 --> 00:17:33,558
Now, sit tight

341
00:17:33,602 --> 00:17:35,266
and trust your older brother.

342
00:17:35,306 --> 00:17:37,642
But I don't want you
to try to save me.

343
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,083
What are you talking about?

344
00:17:40,118 --> 00:17:42,818
They must have done something
to his mind.

345
00:17:42,859 --> 00:17:43,850
What mind?

346
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,229
I'm serious.

347
00:17:45,266 --> 00:17:47,328
Brother, you have
more important things

348
00:17:47,371 --> 00:17:48,635
to worry about.

349
00:17:48,674 --> 00:17:50,976
The bar is doing fine,
but thanks for caring.

350
00:17:51,014 --> 00:17:52,644
I'm not talking about the bar.

351
00:17:52,685 --> 00:17:55,419
What could be more important
than your life?

352
00:17:58,132 --> 00:18:01,596
Destroying
the anti-graviton beam.

353
00:18:01,641 --> 00:18:02,701
Shh!

354
00:18:02,744 --> 00:18:06,150
To prevent the Dominion
from taking down the minefield.

355
00:18:07,156 --> 00:18:09,458
You've got to finish
what I started.

356
00:18:09,495 --> 00:18:11,125
The fate of the entire
Alpha Quadrant

357
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:12,226
rests in your hands.

358
00:18:12,269 --> 00:18:16,143
Billions and billions of people
are counting on you.

359
00:18:16,246 --> 00:18:18,149
Boy, are they going
to be disappointed.

360
00:18:18,251 --> 00:18:19,584
Brother...

361
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,425
you can do this.

362
00:18:22,462 --> 00:18:24,160
You have to do this.

363
00:18:24,267 --> 00:18:25,759
You will do this.

364
00:18:25,803 --> 00:18:27,501
What happens if I get caught?

365
00:18:29,413 --> 00:18:31,543
Then we'll die together...

366
00:18:31,586 --> 00:18:34,286
side by side,
heads held high...

367
00:18:34,326 --> 00:18:36,422
knowing we did our best.

368
00:18:36,464 --> 00:18:37,956
Oh, Rom.

369
00:18:38,002 --> 00:18:40,736
But I don't want to die.

370
00:18:40,776 --> 00:18:43,078
If that's what's written...

371
00:18:43,115 --> 00:18:46,419
then that's what's written.

372
00:18:48,763 --> 00:18:50,232
Now get going, Brother.

373
00:18:50,268 --> 00:18:52,136
You have a lot of work to do.

374
00:19:03,234 --> 00:19:06,140
So... tell me, Leeta,
what else is new?

375
00:19:06,175 --> 00:19:09,115
Have they fixed the sonic shower
in our quarters yet?

376
00:19:24,156 --> 00:19:25,489
Ziyal.

377
00:19:26,528 --> 00:19:28,499
Nerys.

378
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,664
I haven't seen you in weeks.

379
00:19:30,773 --> 00:19:31,833
Do you have a minute?

380
00:19:31,876 --> 00:19:33,608
Sit down.

381
00:19:36,989 --> 00:19:40,430
I need you to talk
to your father for me.

382
00:19:40,465 --> 00:19:41,695
About what?

383
00:19:42,737 --> 00:19:44,605
Rom.

384
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,559
Father?

385
00:19:52,596 --> 00:19:53,860
Ah!

386
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,996
I need to talk to you.

387
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:58,010
Is something wrong, my dear?

388
00:19:58,044 --> 00:20:00,346
Nothing that you can't fix.

389
00:20:00,384 --> 00:20:01,876
Name it.

390
00:20:03,057 --> 00:20:04,925
I want you to free Rom.

391
00:20:04,962 --> 00:20:07,058
You're joking.

392
00:20:07,101 --> 00:20:08,229
Not at all.

393
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,507
I can't free Rom, Ziyal.

394
00:20:12,548 --> 00:20:15,020
He's been sentenced to death
by the Dominion.

395
00:20:15,055 --> 00:20:16,456
You can pardon him.

396
00:20:16,492 --> 00:20:17,722
Don't you see, Father?

397
00:20:17,762 --> 00:20:19,129
This is your chance

398
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:22,140
to show the Bajoran people...
to show Major Kira...

399
00:20:22,173 --> 00:20:23,973
who you really are...

400
00:20:24,011 --> 00:20:26,643
a forgiving,
compassionate man.

401
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:28,485
A great man.

402
00:20:32,132 --> 00:20:34,604
Tell me something, Ziyal...

403
00:20:34,639 --> 00:20:36,941
were you involved
in any way...

404
00:20:36,978 --> 00:20:39,952
with the plans
to sabotage this station?

405
00:20:39,986 --> 00:20:41,616
No, I wasn't involved.

406
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,491
You're sure about that?

407
00:20:43,528 --> 00:20:45,966
I can't help you unless
you tell me the truth.

408
00:20:46,001 --> 00:20:48,530
I am telling you the truth.

409
00:20:48,576 --> 00:20:51,550
The question is: Have you
been telling me the truth?

410
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,882
About what?

411
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,517
That the Bajorans
are wrong about you.

412
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,001
That you regret the horrible
things you had to do

413
00:20:59,035 --> 00:21:01,097
during the occupation.

414
00:21:02,478 --> 00:21:04,848
I do regret them, Ziyal...

415
00:21:04,885 --> 00:21:06,549
deeply.

416
00:21:06,588 --> 00:21:11,089
Then this is your chance
to prove it to everyone

417
00:21:11,134 --> 00:21:14,108
including me.

418
00:21:14,141 --> 00:21:17,742
Show us that you're
capable of mercy.

419
00:21:21,795 --> 00:21:23,162
Rom...

420
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,033
is an enemy of the state

421
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:29,913
and enemies of the state
do not deserve mercy.

422
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,018
Spoken like a true Cardassian.

423
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,532
I am a Cardassian.

424
00:21:36,566 --> 00:21:38,298
And so are you.

425
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,502
No, I'm not!

426
00:21:40,544 --> 00:21:42,743
I could never be like you.

427
00:21:42,782 --> 00:21:44,274
Ziyal...

428
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:55,746
You can't trust them.

429
00:21:55,783 --> 00:21:57,686
I trust latinum,
and so do they.

430
00:21:57,721 --> 00:21:59,624
Five bars will buy me
five Nausicaans

431
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:03,261
and a fast ship
and very few questions.

432
00:22:03,303 --> 00:22:04,602
Breaking Rom out
of the holding cell

433
00:22:04,639 --> 00:22:06,269
will be child's play
compared to the things

434
00:22:06,311 --> 00:22:07,405
they're used to doing.

435
00:22:07,447 --> 00:22:08,416
Forget about it, Quark.

436
00:22:08,449 --> 00:22:09,509
Freeing your brother's

437
00:22:09,552 --> 00:22:11,523
going to take very careful
and precise planning.

438
00:22:11,557 --> 00:22:13,825
It's not the Nausicaan way...
they're thugs.

439
00:22:13,863 --> 00:22:15,857
They'll come strutting
onto the station

440
00:22:15,902 --> 00:22:17,668
look at a Jem'Hadar
the wrong way

441
00:22:17,707 --> 00:22:20,179
and before you know it,
there's blood on the Promenade.

442
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,687
Think I can get my money back?

443
00:22:31,944 --> 00:22:33,277
Major...

444
00:22:33,314 --> 00:22:35,342
a freighter loaded
with Tammeron grain

445
00:22:35,386 --> 00:22:36,787
is due within the hour.

446
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:39,294
See to it that Cargo Bay 5
is ready to receive it.

447
00:22:39,329 --> 00:22:40,298
I'll take care of it.

448
00:22:40,332 --> 00:22:41,301
I'll have a...

449
00:22:41,335 --> 00:22:43,603
Yes, you will.

450
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,166
Now.

451
00:22:49,355 --> 00:22:51,987
That attitude of yours, Major...

452
00:22:52,029 --> 00:22:54,365
it won't be tolerated forever.

453
00:22:55,471 --> 00:22:58,843
You don't like my attitude,
Damar?

454
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,911
You're welcome
to try to change it.

455
00:23:04,628 --> 00:23:07,430
I don't know what Dukat
sees in that woman.

456
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:10,203
Then you need to have
your eyes examined.

457
00:23:10,243 --> 00:23:11,473
One <i>kanar.</i>

458
00:23:11,513 --> 00:23:13,507
Want me to leave the bottle?

459
00:23:15,156 --> 00:23:17,320
Maybe I should
have you taste it first.

460
00:23:17,361 --> 00:23:19,059
Make sure it isn't poisoned.

461
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:21,765
Poisoning the customers
is bad for business.

462
00:23:21,806 --> 00:23:23,070
True.

463
00:23:23,176 --> 00:23:25,512
But some people may place
a brother's revenge

464
00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:26,950
above business.

465
00:23:29,058 --> 00:23:31,029
Not this Ferengi.

466
00:23:34,071 --> 00:23:37,045
You're a credit
to your race, Quark.

467
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:38,480
Unlike your brother

468
00:23:38,516 --> 00:23:41,388
you've chosen to back
the winning side.

469
00:23:42,894 --> 00:23:44,558
All right, you going to tell me

470
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:46,091
or do you want me to guess?

471
00:23:46,136 --> 00:23:47,332
Tell you what?

472
00:23:47,372 --> 00:23:49,776
Oh, don't be coy with me.

473
00:23:49,812 --> 00:23:51,840
Either someone
you don't like has died

474
00:23:51,884 --> 00:23:53,855
or your promotion
came through.

475
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,554
It's better than that.

476
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:01,803
It's about the minefield.

477
00:24:01,843 --> 00:24:02,776
What about it?

478
00:24:02,813 --> 00:24:04,009
It's coming down.

479
00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:05,781
Oh, I've heard that before.

480
00:24:05,821 --> 00:24:07,883
Remember those field tests
I was telling you about?

481
00:24:07,926 --> 00:24:09,486
They were successful.

482
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:12,230
We've begun to deactivate
the mines.

483
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:14,138
Well...

484
00:24:14,209 --> 00:24:16,009
you've got your work
cut out for you.

485
00:24:16,047 --> 00:24:18,451
What's it going to take...
a couple months? A year?

486
00:24:18,487 --> 00:24:19,717
One week.

487
00:24:19,757 --> 00:24:20,987
A week?

488
00:24:21,027 --> 00:24:23,021
That's right.

489
00:24:25,137 --> 00:24:26,401
One week...

490
00:24:26,441 --> 00:24:29,415
and the Alpha Quadrant
is ours.

491
00:24:42,615 --> 00:24:44,107
Gentlemen,
this mission cannot succeed

492
00:24:44,153 --> 00:24:47,184
without the involvement of
the Klingon Defense Forces.

493
00:24:47,228 --> 00:24:48,219
We agree with you, Captain.

494
00:24:48,297 --> 00:24:49,664
Chancellor Gowron does not.

495
00:24:49,701 --> 00:24:51,365
Then you will have
to change his mind.

496
00:24:51,405 --> 00:24:52,897
The Chancellor is reluctant

497
00:24:52,943 --> 00:24:56,247
to commit such a large fleet
to a single engagement.

498
00:24:56,318 --> 00:24:58,916
He believes it would leave
the Empire vulnerable.

499
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:01,625
Starfleet Command had
the same concerns about Earth.

500
00:25:01,665 --> 00:25:03,761
But after careful consideration,
they decided

501
00:25:03,804 --> 00:25:05,205
it was worth the risk.

502
00:25:05,242 --> 00:25:08,877
General, perhaps you should
return to Kronos

503
00:25:08,917 --> 00:25:10,547
and make your plea in person.

504
00:25:10,588 --> 00:25:13,060
The Chancellor has
great respect for you.

505
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:15,829
If you cannot persuade him,
no one can.

506
00:25:16,871 --> 00:25:19,845
I will go to see Gowron

507
00:25:19,879 --> 00:25:21,611
and you will come with me.

508
00:25:22,619 --> 00:25:23,747
No.

509
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:25,817
The Chancellor no longer
considers me a friend.

510
00:25:25,861 --> 00:25:27,160
I know.

511
00:25:27,199 --> 00:25:28,965
But what could be better?

512
00:25:29,002 --> 00:25:32,774
An ally and an enemy both
telling him the same thing.

513
00:25:32,813 --> 00:25:35,651
He'll have no other
choice but to agree.

514
00:25:35,687 --> 00:25:37,783
Gentlemen, I need those ships.

515
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:42,569
And you shall have them.

516
00:26:05,598 --> 00:26:07,124
A week?

517
00:26:08,473 --> 00:26:10,273
Are you sure about that?

518
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,779
That's what he said.

519
00:26:11,881 --> 00:26:14,855
Believe me,
this was no idle boast.

520
00:26:16,827 --> 00:26:17,887
We have to stop them.

521
00:26:17,931 --> 00:26:21,064
And end up in a holding cell
like my brother?

522
00:26:21,105 --> 00:26:22,574
No, thanks.

523
00:26:22,609 --> 00:26:24,911
If we could only get to Odo...

524
00:26:24,949 --> 00:26:27,319
make him see what's going on.

525
00:26:27,355 --> 00:26:29,326
Then maybe he could help us.

526
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,454
Forget about Odo.

527
00:26:30,496 --> 00:26:33,230
First, we can't get to him.

528
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:35,434
Second, even if we did,
he wouldn't help us.

529
00:26:35,476 --> 00:26:40,751
Then what we have to do
is warn Starfleet.

530
00:26:40,789 --> 00:26:43,284
And how do you suggest
we get a message to them?

531
00:26:43,329 --> 00:26:44,525
You're asking me?

532
00:26:44,566 --> 00:26:45,660
You're the terrorist.

533
00:26:45,702 --> 00:26:46,864
I'm just a bartender.

534
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:47,999
There you are.

535
00:26:49,212 --> 00:26:50,613
From the look on your faces

536
00:26:50,649 --> 00:26:52,517
I can see you haven't
had much luck

537
00:26:52,553 --> 00:26:53,817
getting Rom out of jail.

538
00:26:53,857 --> 00:26:55,987
And the news just keeps
getting worse.

539
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,363
It's not all bad.

540
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,371
Trust us, Jake.
It is.

541
00:26:59,405 --> 00:27:01,035
Not for me.

542
00:27:01,076 --> 00:27:04,482
I'm getting a message
out to my dad.

543
00:27:05,721 --> 00:27:06,654
How?

544
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:09,425
I'm a reporter...
I have my ways.

545
00:27:09,464 --> 00:27:12,768
Come on, Jake,
this is no time for games.

546
00:27:16,482 --> 00:27:18,180
- Morn?
- He's going home

547
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,884
for his mother's birthday
or something.

548
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:21,622
He has an encrypted message

549
00:27:21,662 --> 00:27:23,896
for my dad
in one of her presents.

550
00:27:47,563 --> 00:27:49,295
Are you sure this is reliable?

551
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,464
I've known the courier
for five years.

552
00:27:51,506 --> 00:27:52,475
I trust him.

553
00:27:52,509 --> 00:27:54,845
Then we have a problem.

554
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:55,851
According to this

555
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:58,322
the minefield's coming
down in three days.

556
00:27:58,357 --> 00:28:01,729
The Ninth Fleet won't be
here for at least four.

557
00:28:01,767 --> 00:28:04,535
Then I suggest
we go without them.

558
00:28:04,574 --> 00:28:06,511
What about the Klingons?

559
00:28:06,545 --> 00:28:08,607
Looks like we go
without them, too.

560
00:28:08,651 --> 00:28:10,519
We've run out of time, Admiral.

561
00:28:10,556 --> 00:28:13,826
If those Dominion reinforcements
come through the wormhole

562
00:28:13,865 --> 00:28:15,391
we'll have lost everything.

563
00:28:15,435 --> 00:28:18,807
Then we take the ships we have,
fight our way to Deep Space 9

564
00:28:18,844 --> 00:28:20,508
and destroy
the anti-graviton emitter.

565
00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:22,452
It's our only hope.

566
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,693
Do it.

567
00:28:36,523 --> 00:28:38,118
There.

568
00:28:38,161 --> 00:28:39,528
Where?

569
00:28:39,564 --> 00:28:41,194
Over there.

570
00:28:41,236 --> 00:28:42,432
That flash of light

571
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:45,878
was the anti-graviton beam
hitting a mine.

572
00:28:45,914 --> 00:28:48,443
And disabling
its replication unit.

573
00:28:48,487 --> 00:28:49,456
Exactly.

574
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:50,857
Didn't you see it?

575
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:53,493
I'm afraid not.

576
00:28:53,534 --> 00:28:55,802
For months,
you've been demanding

577
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,868
that I take down those mines

578
00:28:57,912 --> 00:29:00,316
and now that it's
finally happening

579
00:29:00,352 --> 00:29:01,982
you can't even see it.

580
00:29:02,023 --> 00:29:04,017
Weak eyes.

581
00:29:04,061 --> 00:29:05,553
Excuse me?

582
00:29:05,598 --> 00:29:07,158
My people have poor eyesight.

583
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:08,729
It's something we've learned

584
00:29:08,774 --> 00:29:09,743
to live with.

585
00:29:09,776 --> 00:29:10,836
Jem'Hadar

586
00:29:10,879 --> 00:29:12,611
on the other hand...
excellent vision.

587
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:15,054
I suppose they need it
more than we do.

588
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:17,220
Ah! There's another one.

589
00:29:17,262 --> 00:29:20,202
I'll have
to take your word for it.

590
00:29:20,237 --> 00:29:24,704
Once we disable the replication
units in all the mines

591
00:29:24,748 --> 00:29:29,523
we can detonate
the entire minefield.

592
00:29:29,561 --> 00:29:34,734
And I guarantee you...
weak eyes or not...

593
00:29:34,774 --> 00:29:38,341
that explosion you will see.

594
00:29:38,384 --> 00:29:40,822
When will you be ready
to proceed?

595
00:29:40,857 --> 00:29:43,831
Approximately 78 hours.

596
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:46,303
Three more days
and we can start to bring

597
00:29:46,338 --> 00:29:49,369
the Jem'Hadar reinforcements
through the wormhole.

598
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:51,941
Excellent! I knew you
could do it, Dukat.

599
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,655
Did you?

600
00:29:57,701 --> 00:30:00,834
I never doubted you
for a moment.

601
00:30:00,876 --> 00:30:02,175
Sir.

602
00:30:02,212 --> 00:30:04,650
I have new information
on enemy fleet movements.

603
00:30:04,685 --> 00:30:05,745
Go ahead.

604
00:30:05,788 --> 00:30:08,192
The Second Fleet has fallen back
past the Kotanka system

605
00:30:08,262 --> 00:30:09,424
while the Fifth Fleet

606
00:30:09,465 --> 00:30:12,496
has pulled out of the fighting
along the Vulcan border.

607
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:15,171
Both fleets have converged
here... Starbase 375.

608
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:17,845
Isn't that where Captain Sisko
is stationed?

609
00:30:17,886 --> 00:30:19,219
He's been made an adjutant

610
00:30:19,323 --> 00:30:21,021
- to Admiral Ross.
- Good for him.

611
00:30:21,997 --> 00:30:24,799
Now, why have those fleets
gathered there?

612
00:30:24,837 --> 00:30:25,806
I'm not sure.

613
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,070
You're not sure?

614
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,340
Two large enemy fleets

615
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:31,218
break off from the front lines
and rendezvous at a starbase

616
00:30:31,254 --> 00:30:32,484
and you have no idea why?

617
00:30:32,524 --> 00:30:37,265
Well, we'll just have
to find out, won't we?

618
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:39,068
See that you do.

619
00:30:43,853 --> 00:30:46,485
He should speak to you
with greater respect.

620
00:30:48,198 --> 00:30:51,434
Someday, I'll let you
teach him that lesson

621
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:53,536
but right now,
there's something

622
00:30:53,579 --> 00:30:56,644
more pressing
I need you to do.

623
00:30:56,687 --> 00:31:02,761
It's of a personal nature,
a matter of some... delicacy.

624
00:31:02,803 --> 00:31:04,706
It's about my daughter.

625
00:31:04,741 --> 00:31:06,074
Ziyal?

626
00:31:06,111 --> 00:31:09,780
We've had a misunderstanding.

627
00:31:09,821 --> 00:31:13,627
I want you to go
and convince her to...

628
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,362
speak with me.

629
00:31:16,404 --> 00:31:17,498
Sir, I really feel

630
00:31:17,541 --> 00:31:20,309
I would be more valuable
tracking the enemy fleet.

631
00:31:20,415 --> 00:31:22,079
I've given you an order, Damar.

632
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:26,689
We're on the verge
of a great victory

633
00:31:26,732 --> 00:31:33,342
and when it comes,
I want my daughter at my side.

634
00:31:33,383 --> 00:31:34,978
Is that understood?

635
00:31:49,123 --> 00:31:52,063
I really believed
my father had changed.

636
00:31:52,097 --> 00:31:54,899
That he wanted
to be a man of peace.

637
00:31:54,938 --> 00:31:56,932
I think he believes that, too...

638
00:31:56,976 --> 00:31:59,848
when it suits his purpose.

639
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:02,652
Everything he's ever said
to me has been a lie.

640
00:32:02,691 --> 00:32:03,819
Not everything.

641
00:32:03,861 --> 00:32:06,629
He really does care about you.

642
00:32:06,669 --> 00:32:08,036
I don't care.

643
00:32:08,072 --> 00:32:09,906
I am not going back to him.

644
00:32:11,915 --> 00:32:13,316
You don't believe me, do you?

645
00:32:14,857 --> 00:32:16,691
Right now, you're angry and hurt

646
00:32:16,728 --> 00:32:18,129
but that's going to pass

647
00:32:18,165 --> 00:32:20,569
and then you'll have
to decide what to do.

648
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,699
Ziyal!

649
00:32:21,741 --> 00:32:23,142
I need to speak to you.

650
00:32:23,178 --> 00:32:25,172
You and I have nothing
to talk about.

651
00:32:25,216 --> 00:32:27,346
Maybe not,
but you and your father do.

652
00:32:27,389 --> 00:32:29,987
He wants to see you.

653
00:32:30,029 --> 00:32:31,966
Well, I don't want to see him.

654
00:32:33,605 --> 00:32:34,733
You heard her.

655
00:32:34,775 --> 00:32:37,111
Stay out of this, Major.

656
00:32:37,147 --> 00:32:38,446
Ziyal, listen.

657
00:32:38,485 --> 00:32:40,923
Your father is a great man...

658
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:42,359
a man of destiny...

659
00:32:42,395 --> 00:32:44,594
but he also carries
great burdens.

660
00:32:44,633 --> 00:32:46,729
He knows our alliance
with the Dominion

661
00:32:46,773 --> 00:32:47,969
is a dangerous one.

662
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:51,074
If we show any sign of weakness,
our allies will turn on us.

663
00:32:51,117 --> 00:32:53,715
That is why we must all
help him remain strong.

664
00:32:53,757 --> 00:32:56,423
So I ask you to be
a true daughter of Cardassia

665
00:32:56,464 --> 00:32:57,694
and stand beside him.

666
00:32:57,734 --> 00:32:59,898
It should be obvious,
even to you, Damar

667
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:03,438
that I am not "a true
daughter of Cardassia"!

668
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:05,454
What is obvious to me
is that your father

669
00:33:05,521 --> 00:33:08,221
should have left you to rot
in that Breen prison camp.

670
00:33:08,261 --> 00:33:09,287
But he didn't.

671
00:33:09,331 --> 00:33:10,800
He took pity on you

672
00:33:10,835 --> 00:33:12,134
and it's your duty to repay him.

673
00:33:12,171 --> 00:33:13,140
Now come with me.

674
00:33:13,174 --> 00:33:14,005
Let her go.

675
00:33:15,681 --> 00:33:17,777
And if I don't?

676
00:33:17,819 --> 00:33:19,083
What happens, then?

677
00:33:19,123 --> 00:33:21,687
I was hoping you'd ask.

678
00:33:36,736 --> 00:33:38,205
Did you kill him?

679
00:33:38,239 --> 00:33:41,703
No, but I thought about it.

680
00:33:41,749 --> 00:33:44,187
What are you going to do
when he wakes up?

681
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:45,555
That's up to him.

682
00:34:01,378 --> 00:34:03,349
I just came to wish you luck.

683
00:34:03,383 --> 00:34:05,047
Oh, thank you.

684
00:34:05,088 --> 00:34:06,148
My father says

685
00:34:06,191 --> 00:34:08,390
you can never have
too much good luck.

686
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:10,560
Your father sounds
like a wise man.

687
00:34:10,603 --> 00:34:12,733
And he makes a fierce jambalaya.

688
00:34:14,512 --> 00:34:15,845
What's this?

689
00:34:15,882 --> 00:34:17,477
Ancient Bajoran texts.

690
00:34:19,258 --> 00:34:21,628
Ah. The Emissary
looks for guidance

691
00:34:21,664 --> 00:34:23,156
on the eve of battle.

692
00:34:23,202 --> 00:34:27,144
Guidance, insights, loopholes...

693
00:34:27,178 --> 00:34:29,342
I'll take anything I can get.

694
00:34:29,385 --> 00:34:31,789
And what do
the Prophets tell you?

695
00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:35,527
That I have a long way to go

696
00:34:35,567 --> 00:34:38,564
before I can make any sense
of their prophecies.

697
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:43,985
Maybe when this war is over,
you can look at them closer.

698
00:34:44,056 --> 00:34:46,084
That would be a change.

699
00:34:46,127 --> 00:34:48,691
Spend a week or two
down on Bajor.

700
00:34:48,735 --> 00:34:50,831
Visit the Dakeen Monastery.

701
00:34:50,873 --> 00:34:52,103
I've never been on Bajor.

702
00:34:52,143 --> 00:34:54,479
I hear it's quite nice.

703
00:34:54,516 --> 00:34:56,487
Nice?

704
00:34:56,521 --> 00:34:59,518
That hardly describes it at all.

705
00:34:59,563 --> 00:35:01,797
There are parts
of the Eastern Province

706
00:35:01,836 --> 00:35:03,773
that are like Eden itself...

707
00:35:03,807 --> 00:35:06,405
lush green valleys
covered in wildflowers

708
00:35:06,447 --> 00:35:08,475
that seem to spring
up overnight;

709
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:10,683
hundreds of small,
crystal-clear ponds

710
00:35:10,725 --> 00:35:13,459
interconnected by waterfalls...

711
00:35:13,499 --> 00:35:15,333
All right, all right.
I'm convinced.

712
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:17,672
I'm already planning
my next R&R down there.

713
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:21,174
You know, it sounds like,
when your assignment

714
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:22,654
on Deep Space 9 is over

715
00:35:22,689 --> 00:35:24,991
and Bajor is welcomed
into the Federation

716
00:35:25,029 --> 00:35:27,763
you're going to have
a tough time saying good-bye.

717
00:35:27,803 --> 00:35:30,002
I don't plan to say good-bye.

718
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:35,453
I plan to build
a house on Bajor.

719
00:35:35,489 --> 00:35:36,890
And what if Starfleet

720
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:39,161
assigns you
to a different sector?

721
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:41,967
I will go wherever they send me

722
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:45,071
but when I go home...

723
00:35:45,114 --> 00:35:47,882
it will be to Bajor.

724
00:36:02,325 --> 00:36:04,627
Chief! I was
just coming to see you.

725
00:36:04,665 --> 00:36:05,895
Can you believe it?

726
00:36:05,935 --> 00:36:07,427
They made me an Ensign.

727
00:36:07,472 --> 00:36:09,842
I hadn't realized things
were going so bad.

728
00:36:09,878 --> 00:36:10,847
Scary, isn't it?

729
00:36:10,881 --> 00:36:12,476
If my classmates
at the Academy

730
00:36:12,518 --> 00:36:13,487
could only see me now.

731
00:36:13,521 --> 00:36:14,649
They'd be surprised,
would they?

732
00:36:14,691 --> 00:36:15,660
"Amazed" is more like it.

733
00:36:15,694 --> 00:36:16,822
What do they know?

734
00:36:16,863 --> 00:36:19,062
Anyway, I just want to say
thanks for all your help.

735
00:36:19,102 --> 00:36:20,071
My help?

736
00:36:20,105 --> 00:36:22,076
I've learned a lot from you

737
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,340
and not just about engineering.

738
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,442
You've shown me what it takes
to be a good soldier.

739
00:36:25,485 --> 00:36:27,388
Don't let that uniform
go to your head.

740
00:36:27,424 --> 00:36:29,361
You've a lot to learn yet...

741
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:30,955
and you will.

742
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,732
Congratulations, Ensign.

743
00:36:32,771 --> 00:36:33,967
Wear it with pride.

744
00:36:34,008 --> 00:36:35,375
I intend to, Chief.

745
00:36:40,558 --> 00:36:41,891
Captain on the Bridge.

746
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,205
I've kept it warm for you, Ben.

747
00:36:55,196 --> 00:36:57,167
Ensign, alert all ships.

748
00:36:57,201 --> 00:36:58,568
We're moving out.

749
00:36:58,605 --> 00:37:00,508
Aye, sir.

750
00:37:15,182 --> 00:37:17,176
Our initial
intelligence reports

751
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,088
have been verified.

752
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:22,031
The Federation fleet
is on the move.

753
00:37:22,066 --> 00:37:23,558
Do we know their destination?

754
00:37:23,603 --> 00:37:25,072
Yes. It appears
they're headed here.

755
00:37:25,107 --> 00:37:26,076
Here?

756
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,081
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

757
00:37:28,115 --> 00:37:31,089
He knows we're taking down
the minefield.

758
00:37:32,092 --> 00:37:34,188
Someone must've gotten
a message out.

759
00:37:34,231 --> 00:37:36,465
So it would seem.

760
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:37,973
No matter.

761
00:37:38,007 --> 00:37:39,978
We'll crush them.

762
00:37:40,012 --> 00:37:41,642
Yes. Yes, we will

763
00:37:41,683 --> 00:37:45,420
but in order to do that,
I'm going to have to pull

764
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,363
a significant number
of our ships

765
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:48,799
off the front lines.

766
00:37:48,835 --> 00:37:49,963
Do it.

767
00:37:50,005 --> 00:37:51,406
Come in.

768
00:37:51,442 --> 00:37:53,208
Once the minefield is down

769
00:37:53,246 --> 00:37:54,215
we'll have more
than enough ships

770
00:37:54,249 --> 00:37:55,513
to take their place.

771
00:37:57,691 --> 00:38:00,061
I understand.

772
00:38:00,097 --> 00:38:02,000
One moment, please.

773
00:38:07,116 --> 00:38:09,588
I want your permission
to arrest Major Kira.

774
00:38:09,623 --> 00:38:11,651
Kira? What about Ziyal?

775
00:38:11,695 --> 00:38:12,789
Did you talk to her?

776
00:38:12,831 --> 00:38:13,993
She doesn't want to see you.

777
00:38:14,034 --> 00:38:17,133
When I insisted,
the Major... objected.

778
00:38:17,176 --> 00:38:19,044
What did you do to Ziyal?

779
00:38:19,081 --> 00:38:20,209
I did nothing to her.

780
00:38:20,251 --> 00:38:22,017
Then why did the Major
attack you?

781
00:38:22,054 --> 00:38:24,048
You must have done something...

782
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:25,586
threatened my daughter
in some way.

783
00:38:25,631 --> 00:38:28,126
Damar, I told you to be tactful.

784
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:30,266
Excuse me.

785
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,976
Don't you think
resolving family squabbles

786
00:38:33,017 --> 00:38:35,615
can wait
until after we've won this war?

787
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:39,458
Weak eyes, good ears.

788
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,833
Yes, of course.

789
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:42,636
You're quite right.

790
00:38:42,675 --> 00:38:44,612
Then you're clear
on what must be done?

791
00:38:44,646 --> 00:38:45,774
I'm going to call back

792
00:38:45,816 --> 00:38:49,086
enough ships to destroy
the Federation fleet

793
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:50,823
and hold this station.

794
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,210
The Federation is
moving against us?

795
00:38:59,251 --> 00:39:00,220
That's right.

796
00:39:00,253 --> 00:39:01,279
Now, I want to know

797
00:39:01,323 --> 00:39:03,727
exactly what went on
between you and Ziyal.

798
00:39:10,046 --> 00:39:11,606
It's odd.

799
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:14,054
I've stood here countless times

800
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:17,292
and yet, somehow it
all looks different.

801
00:39:17,332 --> 00:39:19,566
It's the solids.

802
00:39:19,604 --> 00:39:22,133
They look small, don't they?

803
00:39:22,177 --> 00:39:23,943
Insignificant.

804
00:39:23,982 --> 00:39:26,352
It's not their fault.

805
00:39:26,388 --> 00:39:28,758
I'm not placing blame.

806
00:39:28,795 --> 00:39:30,698
They're trapped.

807
00:39:30,733 --> 00:39:33,969
Confined to a single shape.

808
00:39:34,008 --> 00:39:36,138
A single perspective.

809
00:39:36,181 --> 00:39:38,676
It's so limiting.

810
00:39:40,692 --> 00:39:42,994
I feel sorry for them.

811
00:39:43,032 --> 00:39:45,766
They need our guidance, Odo

812
00:39:45,805 --> 00:39:47,708
not our pity.

813
00:39:47,743 --> 00:39:50,079
They cherish their freedom.

814
00:39:50,116 --> 00:39:52,954
We'll have to break them
of that.

815
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:55,121
Break them?

816
00:39:55,163 --> 00:39:57,327
In a manner of speaking.

817
00:39:57,369 --> 00:40:00,275
Oh, this language
of the solids...

818
00:40:00,309 --> 00:40:02,212
it's so imprecise.

819
00:40:02,248 --> 00:40:04,948
What exactly do you plan to do?

820
00:40:04,989 --> 00:40:08,829
The solids are no longer
your concern, Odo.

821
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:12,135
What must be done will be done.

822
00:40:12,173 --> 00:40:14,668
It's as simple as that.

823
00:40:14,713 --> 00:40:16,411
Forgive me for intruding

824
00:40:16,451 --> 00:40:19,425
but I have important news
about the war.

825
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:22,865
Why don't you return
to your quarters, Odo?

826
00:40:22,901 --> 00:40:25,773
I'll join you there shortly.

827
00:40:25,809 --> 00:40:27,541
Don't worry.

828
00:40:27,581 --> 00:40:30,987
Everything will be fine.

829
00:40:31,022 --> 00:40:32,993
I promise.

830
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,408
I must say...

831
00:40:42,453 --> 00:40:46,590
you're doing a
wonderful job with Odo.

832
00:40:46,696 --> 00:40:48,291
Meaning what?

833
00:40:48,334 --> 00:40:52,607
Meaning that he's always posed
a potential threat to our plans

834
00:40:52,712 --> 00:40:54,410
but you seem to have...

835
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:56,512
neutralized him quite nicely.

836
00:40:56,555 --> 00:40:57,667
Neutralize Odo?

837
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,600
Is that why you think I'm here?

838
00:40:59,638 --> 00:41:02,612
Odo is a changeling.

839
00:41:02,646 --> 00:41:05,380
Bringing him home,
returning him to the Great Link

840
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:08,086
means more to us
than the Alpha Quadrant itself.

841
00:41:08,128 --> 00:41:10,122
Is that clear?

842
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:12,866
I meant no disrespect.

843
00:41:12,906 --> 00:41:14,900
Well, of course you didn't.

844
00:41:14,945 --> 00:41:16,575
You are what you are...

845
00:41:16,616 --> 00:41:18,918
a loyal subject of the Dominion.

846
00:41:18,955 --> 00:41:20,356
Come. Walk with me.

847
00:41:20,392 --> 00:41:22,762
You said you had important news.

848
00:41:40,612 --> 00:41:42,207
Major!

849
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:50,961
Kira!

850
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:53,010
Kira, wait, please.

851
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:54,535
I have nothing to say to you.

852
00:41:54,581 --> 00:41:55,607
I understand that you're angry.

853
00:41:55,651 --> 00:41:57,143
Oh, you bet I am angry.

854
00:41:57,188 --> 00:41:58,852
Do you have any idea
what's going on?

855
00:41:58,893 --> 00:42:00,659
Yes... somewhat.

856
00:42:00,697 --> 00:42:02,030
I've been occupied.

857
00:42:02,067 --> 00:42:05,132
Ah... Dukat is bringing
down the minefield

858
00:42:05,175 --> 00:42:07,203
the Federation is
about to be overrun

859
00:42:07,247 --> 00:42:08,511
by the Dominion reinforcements

860
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:10,544
and Weyoun has ordered
Rom's execution

861
00:42:10,589 --> 00:42:12,321
and you have been occupied.

862
00:42:12,427 --> 00:42:14,330
This is so difficult
to explain.

863
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:16,337
If you're going to talk to me
about the Link, don't bother.

864
00:42:16,371 --> 00:42:17,340
I'm a solid, remember?

865
00:42:17,373 --> 00:42:18,342
I won't understand.

866
00:42:18,376 --> 00:42:19,367
Nerys...

867
00:42:21,451 --> 00:42:22,818
I'm sorry.

868
00:42:22,854 --> 00:42:24,346
Sorry?

869
00:42:24,426 --> 00:42:26,796
That's what you wanted
to tell me?

870
00:42:26,831 --> 00:42:28,061
You're sorry?

871
00:42:28,101 --> 00:42:29,502
Yes.

872
00:42:29,539 --> 00:42:31,373
Well, let me
tell you something, Odo.

873
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:35,182
We are way, way past "sorry."

874
00:42:51,094 --> 00:42:53,122
Sir, incoming message
from the <i>Cortéz.</i>

875
00:42:53,166 --> 00:42:54,796
They're still having
trouble stabilizing

876
00:42:54,837 --> 00:42:56,808
the guidance thrusters
on the port nacelle.

877
00:42:56,842 --> 00:42:58,608
Tell them to drop back
and make repairs.

878
00:42:58,647 --> 00:43:00,277
Bring up the <i>Sarek</i>
to take its place.

879
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:01,344
Will do.

880
00:43:01,388 --> 00:43:02,687
That's the 11th ship

881
00:43:02,725 --> 00:43:04,285
to fall out of formation.

882
00:43:04,328 --> 00:43:05,923
Nice of you to keep track,
Garak.

883
00:43:05,966 --> 00:43:07,401
He can't help being negative.

884
00:43:07,503 --> 00:43:08,529
It's in his nature.

885
00:43:08,573 --> 00:43:10,544
On the contrary.

886
00:43:10,578 --> 00:43:12,276
I always hope for the best.

887
00:43:12,316 --> 00:43:14,150
Experience, unfortunately

888
00:43:14,188 --> 00:43:17,424
has taught me
to expect the worst.

889
00:43:17,496 --> 00:43:18,988
I'm picking something up.

890
00:43:19,034 --> 00:43:23,637
It's a large Dominion fleet,
bearing 004 mark 009.

891
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:25,080
How large?

892
00:43:25,117 --> 00:43:27,453
1,254 ships.

893
00:43:27,555 --> 00:43:29,685
They outnumber us two to one.

894
00:43:29,728 --> 00:43:31,996
Now who's being negative?

895
00:43:32,034 --> 00:43:33,937
Ensign, on screen.

896
00:43:33,973 --> 00:43:35,465
Maximum magnification.

897
00:43:35,576 --> 00:43:36,909
Aye, sir.

898
00:43:49,647 --> 00:43:51,277
To all ships...

899
00:43:51,317 --> 00:43:53,049
this is Captain Sisko.

900
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:55,788
Assume attack formation
delta-two.

901
00:44:03,181 --> 00:44:05,311
There's an old saying...

902
00:44:05,354 --> 00:44:08,054
"Fortune favors the bold."

903
00:44:10,066 --> 00:44:11,661
Well...

904
00:44:11,704 --> 00:44:14,576
I guess we're about to find out.
