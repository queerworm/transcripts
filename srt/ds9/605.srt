1
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:09,593
Cadet.

2
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:11,345
Continuing to emit
distress signals

3
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:12,554
on all frequencies, sir.

4
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,055
Chief.

5
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:15,599
We're still venting plasma.

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,643
Any ship
within 100 million kilometers

7
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:18,853
will know we're here...

8
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:20,896
and that we're not going
anywhere.

9
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:23,398
We have company, Captain.

10
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,275
Two Dominion ships
heading this way

11
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,694
bearing 197

12
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:28,153
mark 135.

13
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,531
They'll have us in weapons range
in 22 seconds.

14
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:31,490
Shields?

15
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,491
Shields at 30 percent.

16
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:33,701
Phaser banks?

17
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:35,619
The entire weapons array
is off-line.

18
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:38,831
Now we find something
to hold onto.

19
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:47,297
Shields are down to 20 percent.

20
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:57,432
Now?

21
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:01,102
Now. Shields up,
engines at full impulse.

22
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,103
Power to main phasers.

23
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,271
Target locked.

24
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,606
Fire!

25
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,780
Cadet, are there any other
Dominion ships out there?

26
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,741
None that I can see.

27
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:16,284
This is the
Captain speaking.

28
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:18,245
All hands, stand down.

29
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:19,204
Good job, people.

30
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,706
(<i> console beeping</i> )

31
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:22,123
NOG:
We're being hailed
by the<i> Rotarran.</i>

32
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:24,083
Commander Worf
wants to speak to you.

33
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:25,293
On screen.

34
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:28,380
<i>Well done, Captain.</i>

35
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,925
<i>You were</i>
<i>a very effective decoy.</i>

36
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:32,927
How about next time
we switch roles?

37
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:34,344
That way, I can rescue you.

38
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,346
O'BRIEN:
You may have to wait
awhile, Captain.

39
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:39,516
We've just received orders
from Starfleet Command.

40
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:44,187
All ships in this sector
to pull back to Starbase 375.

41
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,522
Fall back again.

42
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,357
Engage, retreat.
Engage, retreat.

43
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:50,193
I tell you, that's becoming
our favorite tune.

44
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,695
Well, we better think
of a new tune fast

45
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,321
or the only song
we're going to be singing

46
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,489
is "Hail
the Conquering Dominion."

47
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:55,699
DAX:
I wouldn't
start learning

48
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:57,618
those lyrics
just yet, Doctor.

49
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:58,744
Worf,

50
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,913
we'll see you at Starbase 375.

51
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:03,415
<i>I will be waiting.</i>

52
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:05,709
Set a course
for these coordinates.

53
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:06,877
Warp seven.

54
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,638
I don't know
what all you brass hats

55
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,640
in Starfleet Command
are thinking,

56
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,142
but take it
from a simple field officer--

57
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:26,021
we're not going to win this war
by running away from the enemy.

58
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,022
I know that.

59
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:28,356
Benjamin,
troop morale

60
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:29,942
is at an all-time low.

61
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:32,444
Even the Klingons
are starting to wonder

62
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:34,947
if we can defeat
the Dominion.

63
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:37,658
We need a victory--
a big victory--

64
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,493
and we need it soon.

65
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,495
I couldn't agree with you more.

66
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,540
Then do something about it.

67
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,167
I already have.

68
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,919
In fact,
I'm presenting a plan

69
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,339
to Starfleet Command
at 0800 tomorrow.

70
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,799
What plan?

71
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:02,016
We're going to retake
Deep Space 9.

72
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,559
Everything appears
to be perfectly normal.

73
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,727
I'm sorry, Garak.

74
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,353
Well, keep looking,
Doctor.

75
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:15,690
Whatever Starfleet put in there
is very well-hidden.

76
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,109
Ridiculous.

77
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:18,568
Well, that's easy
for you to say, Chief.

78
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,612
You don't know them
as well as I do.

79
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:21,905
These are desperate people.

80
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,240
DAX:
Garak, you're not going

81
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,574
to get<i> any</i> of us
to believe

82
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,243
that Starfleet Intelligence

83
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,954
has implanted some kind
of neural transponder

84
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,247
in your brain
to monitor your thoughts.

85
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,124
I would have if I were them.

86
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:34,835
In fact, when I was
conducting interrogations

87
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,629
for the Obsidian Order,
I did a lot worse.

88
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,298
I'm sure you did.

89
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:41,175
WORF:
They are not interrogating
you, Mr. Garak--

90
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,302
they are debriefing.
There<i> is</i> a difference.

91
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:44,886
Not from where I'm sitting.

92
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,847
Oh, I'll have
a<i> raktajino,</i> Julian.

93
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,515
And a<i> raktajino.</i>

94
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:49,891
O'BRIEN:
Look, Garak,

95
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,643
we are at war
with the Dominion.

96
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,145
Cardassia is part
of the Dominion.

97
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:54,688
You are a Cardassian

98
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,564
and, at one time, you were
a fairly important one.

99
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,275
Of course
Starfleet Intelligence

100
00:05:58,275 --> 00:05:59,860
is going to press you
for specifics.

101
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,945
They need to know
everything you know.

102
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,030
WORF:
Any small detail

103
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,489
could prove extremely important.

104
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,907
Well, take it from me--

105
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,202
it's a lot more fun
asking questions

106
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:09,870
than answering them.

107
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,663
All things considered,

108
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:15,292
I'd rather be on the<i> Defiant</i>
with all of you.

109
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,044
Oh, believe me, you
haven't been missing much.

110
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:19,004
DAX:
Hopefully, all of that's
about to change.

111
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:21,798
Do you think Starfleet Command
will approve Sisko's plan?

112
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,051
Well, we'll find out
soon enough.

113
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,636
He's in there
presenting it right now.

114
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,805
Here's to retaking
the castle.

115
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:33,185
And planting our flag
on its battlements once again.

116
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:36,355
You two have spent too much time
in the holosuites.

117
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:38,397
By putting together
a task force comprised

118
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:40,775
of elements of the Second,
Fifth and Ninth Fleets

119
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,569
I believe we can retake
Deep Space 9--

120
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,321
the most important piece
of real estate

121
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:45,488
in the Alpha Quadrant.

122
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,990
FEMALE:
Your plan, Captain Sisko,

123
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,283
is not without merit.

124
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:49,993
However, I remain skeptical.

125
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:54,497
The Dominion will undoubtedly
send a large fleet to stop you.

126
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,916
And it will divert their forces

127
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,959
and slow their advance
into Federation territory.

128
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,460
As well as leave their
flank vulnerable.

129
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,628
Which will give us
a chance

130
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,047
to be on the offensive
for a change.

131
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:04,091
There's one thing that
still concerns me.

132
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:05,384
What's that, Admiral?

133
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:06,718
Earth.

134
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:09,888
You've left it
a very tempting target.

135
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,223
Earth will still
be defended

136
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,182
by the Third Fleet.

137
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,600
But what
if you're wrong

138
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,727
and the Dominion
doesn't commit its forces

139
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,437
to protect Deep Space 9?

140
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,857
What if, instead, they launch
a full-scale assault on Earth?

141
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,567
If we follow
the plan

142
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,526
you're proposing

143
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,819
we'll never be able

144
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,281
to get reinforcements
there in time.

145
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,574
The Dominion won't attack Earth.

146
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,118
How can you be sure?

147
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:34,162
Because Earth isn't the key
to the Alpha Quadrant--

148
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,289
the wormhole is.

149
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:37,582
And whoever controls
Deep Space 9

150
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:38,792
controls the wormhole.

151
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:50,011
Unbelievable.

152
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,306
Amazing.

153
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,557
What nerve.

154
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,184
Morn, you do have a problem

155
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,770
but lucky for you,
the solution is simple.

156
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,522
You're a grown man,
and if you don't want

157
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,984
to attend your mother's
birthday party

158
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,568
you don't have to.

159
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:09,739
<i>And</i> if she keeps
whining about it

160
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,117
just remind her
there's a war on

161
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:14,619
and you have
things to do.

162
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,663
Another ale?

163
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,961
Um... uh...

164
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,754
here, uh...

165
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,381
it's on the house.

166
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,683
Major, you ready?
Now?

167
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,310
Right now.

168
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,895
All right, but I don't think
it'll do any good.

169
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,230
I keep telling myself

170
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,607
that Odo never meant
to have Rom arrested.

171
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:45,900
It was all a mistake--

172
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,568
bad timing, bad luck.

173
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,529
I thought that, too,
at first.

174
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,199
I have known Odo
a long time.

175
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,159
He's not a collaborator.

176
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,619
Then why is your brother
still in a holding cell?

177
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,582
We're here to see Odo.

178
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,668
The Founders are
not to be disturbed.

179
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,338
Odo will make
an exception for us.

180
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:08,465
There are no exceptions.

181
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,633
I'd like to hear that from Odo.

182
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,511
I'm sorry, Major,
but you're wasting your time.

183
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:15,680
His orders were quite clear.
He doesn't want to see anyone--

184
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,557
not until his guest has left.

185
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,726
And how long has his guest
been visiting?

186
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,978
As far as I know,
the female changeling

187
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,731
has not left his quarters
for three days.

188
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,066
Step away from the
door, Ferengi!

189
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,275
Hey, hey!

190
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,861
Perhaps it would be best
if you left.

191
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:30,945
My colleague here

192
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,073
takes his duties
very seriously.

193
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,409
I promise to tell Odo
you were here.

194
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,746
Let's go, Quark.

195
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,257
So...

196
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:54,302
that is how the solids
experience intimacy.

197
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,598
Not all solids.

198
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,809
Humans... Bajorans...

199
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,978
I really must
thank you, Odo.

200
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,272
For what?

201
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,941
For giving me
new insight
into the solids.

202
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,861
And what
have you learned?

203
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,655
That what they
consider intimacy

204
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,907
is only a shadow

205
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:19,286
of what we experience
in the Great Link.

206
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,498
You don't agree?

207
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,167
I didn't say that.

208
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,504
You have done this
before?

209
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,882
Not often.

210
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,635
But when you have,
you enjoyed it?

211
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:38,888
Yes.

212
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,140
And you regret

213
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,393
not having experienced it
with Major Kira?

214
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,731
I'd rather not
discuss Major Kira.

215
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,567
I don't see why not.

216
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:51,818
When we link,

217
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,861
your feelings for her
are made very clear.

218
00:10:55,822 --> 00:11:00,785
Then why do you insist
that we<i> talk</i> about it?

219
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:04,998
Because talking is still
very important to you.

220
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,250
But one day, it won't be.

221
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,462
One day, the Link
will be all that you need,

222
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:12,713
and that day
is coming soon.

223
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:14,757
Is it?

224
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,092
It's amazing

225
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,719
that you have survived
this long without it.

226
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,138
It's only now

227
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:23,141
after I have been away
from the Great Link myself

228
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,601
that I understand
how painful

229
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:25,977
it must have
been for you.

230
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,730
It hasn't always been easy.

231
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,066
Odo, you
never have

232
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,110
to be alone again.

233
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,033
Well...

234
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,700
I'd better be going.

235
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,038
There's a meeting
of the station's Ruling Council.

236
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,039
Dukat and Weyoun

237
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,248
are expecting me.

238
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,708
That meeting was held
three days ago.

239
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,588
Three days?

240
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,092
Three days.

241
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:04,140
How could I have lost track
of that much time?

242
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,184
Does that bother you?

243
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,438
Yes, it does.

244
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,399
Well, don't let it.

245
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,818
You've been living
with the solids' concept of time

246
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,029
for too long.

247
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,156
Let them worry
about their meetings

248
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,283
their schedules,
their obligations.

249
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:25,453
None of that
has anything
to do with you.

250
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,997
You are a changeling.

251
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,083
You are timeless.

252
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,421
As am I.

253
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,015
You asked
to see me, Major?

254
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,267
That's right. I--

255
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:32,145
First, tell me
something.

256
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,105
What do you think of this?

257
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,898
It's one of
Ziyal's paintings.

258
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,525
I know who
the artist is.

259
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,026
Her father gave it to me.

260
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:42,196
He claims it won some sort
of prize on Cardassia.

261
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,073
Gul Dukat must be very proud--

262
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,950
I suppose.

263
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,160
Is it...

264
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,705
any good?

265
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,540
I think so.
Why, don't you?

266
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,459
I don't know how to judge it.

267
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:59,130
You see, my people
lack a sense of aesthetics.

268
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,173
That's too bad.

269
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,008
I sometimes think so as well.

270
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,843
But if aesthetics
were truly important

271
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:06,845
the Founders
would have included it

272
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,473
in our genetic makeup.

273
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,767
Or... they made a mistake.

274
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,728
Gods don't make mistakes.

275
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:20,026
Though... sometimes...

276
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:25,740
I think it would be nice
to be able to carry a tune.

277
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,205
So...

278
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,581
what can I do
for you, Major?

279
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,624
It's about Rom.

280
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,584
Oh, yes.

281
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,545
The Ferengi saboteur.

282
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:41,756
He has been in a holding cell
for over a week.

283
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,383
Has it really been
that long?

284
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,634
And I was hoping

285
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:47,053
that you would consider
releasing him.

286
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:50,931
Impossible.
You can't release a man
and then execute him.

287
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:51,932
It makes no sense.

288
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,560
Execute Rom?

289
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,313
He committed an act of terrorism
against the Dominion.

290
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:01,275
Not only did he try
to interfere with our efforts

291
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,403
to take down the minefield

292
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:06,113
but, as I understand
it, he's also

293
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,908
the diabolical genius
who came up with the idea

294
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,703
of self-replicating mines
in the first place.

295
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,581
I'm afraid there's no
getting around it, Major.

296
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,833
He must be made
an example, so that
others think twice

297
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,292
before they act
against us.

298
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,293
He is married

299
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,461
to a Bajoran
citizen.

300
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,838
I'm well aware of that

301
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,215
and I'm willing to believe--
for now--

302
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,175
his wife is not
a coconspirator.

303
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,052
Otherwise, treaty or no treaty,
she would share

304
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,555
her husband's fate.

305
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:32,306
I'm sorry, Major.

306
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,643
The Dominion takes a dim view
of terrorism.

307
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,979
Your...<i> friend...</i>

308
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:42,024
must pay the price
for his crime.

309
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,943
We'll see what
the Bajoran government

310
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,820
has to say
about that.

311
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,198
I'm afraid their pleas
will fall on deaf ears.

312
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,742
Major.

313
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,496
Would this be
more aesthetically pleasing

314
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,373
if it were blue?

315
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,634
I'm going to die.

316
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:08,551
Stop saying that.

317
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:09,636
I didn't say it--

318
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:10,595
he did.

319
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:11,930
What I said is

320
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,265
they're<i> planning</i>
to execute you.

321
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:15,975
It's not the same thing.

322
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,811
It is to me.

323
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:20,187
Rom, we are not going
to let them hurt you.

324
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,314
Kira has gone

325
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,274
to the Bajoran Council
of Ministers.

326
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,777
She's asking them
to lodge an official protest.

327
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:28,070
That's sweet, but I doubt
it'll do any good.

328
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,740
QUARK:
And I've talked to
Grand Nagus Zek himself

329
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,659
and he has offered to buy
your freedom

330
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,076
from the Dominion.

331
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,871
I don't think Weyoun
cares much for latinum.

332
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,207
I'm a dead man.

333
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,292
(<i> high-pitched sob</i> )

334
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,339
Will you stop
upsetting Leeta?

335
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:47,799
Sorry.

336
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:48,967
(<i> sobs</i> )

337
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:50,009
Besides...

338
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:53,972
you think your big brother
will let anything happen to you?

339
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:55,473
What can you do?

340
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,726
I'm not sure

341
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,688
but I will think
of something.

342
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,861
No matter what it takes...

343
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,739
no matter what I have to do

344
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:14,575
I'm going to get
you out of here.

345
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:18,705
You do that and... I'll work
your dabo tables for free.

346
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:19,789
For how long?

347
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:22,667
An entire year.
Make it two.

348
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:23,960
Brother!
Shh!

349
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:30,591
Isn't your life worth two years?

350
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,553
Now, sit tight

351
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:36,222
and trust your
older brother.

352
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,725
But I don't want you
to try to save me.

353
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:41,143
What are you talking about?

354
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,854
They must have done something
to his mind.

355
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:43,813
What mind?

356
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,231
ROM:
I'm serious.

357
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,233
Brother, you have
more important things

358
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,609
to worry about.

359
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,987
The bar is doing fine,
but thanks for caring.

360
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,655
I'm not talking
about the bar.

361
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:55,491
What could be more important
than your life?

362
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:01,288
Destroying
the anti-graviton beam.

363
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:02,289
Shh!

364
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,374
To prevent
the Dominion

365
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:07,127
from taking down
the minefield.

366
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,547
You've got to finish
what I started.

367
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,131
The fate of the entire
Alpha Quadrant

368
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,216
rests in your hands.

369
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,260
Billions and
billions of people

370
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,178
are counting on you.

371
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,264
Boy, are they going
to be disappointed.

372
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,682
Brother...

373
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,476
you can do this.

374
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,270
You<i> have</i> to do this.

375
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,813
You<i> will</i> do this.

376
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,607
What happens if I get caught?

377
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,527
Then we'll die together--

378
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:34,363
side by side,
heads held high--

379
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,449
knowing we did our best.

380
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:37,951
Oh, Rom.

381
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,661
But I don't want to die.

382
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,997
If that's what's written...

383
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:46,459
then that's what's written.

384
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:50,129
Now get going, Brother.

385
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,172
You have a lot
of work to do.

386
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:06,145
So... tell me, Leeta,
what else is new?

387
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,981
Have they fixed
the sonic shower

388
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,148
in our quarters yet?

389
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,399
(<i> high-pitched sob</i> )

390
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,124
Ziyal.

391
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,043
Nerys.

392
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:31,295
I haven't seen you in weeks.

393
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,421
Do you have a minute?

394
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,214
Sit down.

395
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,972
I need you to talk
to your father for me.

396
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:42,306
About what?

397
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,225
Rom.

398
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,109
Father?

399
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,443
Ah!

400
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,445
I need to talk to you.

401
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,489
Is something
wrong, my dear?

402
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,908
Nothing that
you can't fix.

403
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,451
Name it.

404
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,454
I want you
to free Rom.

405
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,623
You're joking.

406
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,791
Not at all.

407
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,920
I can't free Rom, Ziyal.

408
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,548
He's been sentenced to death
by the Dominion.

409
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:16,924
You can pardon him.

410
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,217
Don't you see,
Father?

411
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,635
This is
your chance

412
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:22,680
to show the Bajoran people--
to show Major Kira--

413
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,473
who you really are--

414
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,185
a forgiving,
compassionate man.

415
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:29,020
A<i> great</i> man.

416
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,984
Tell me something, Ziyal--

417
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,319
were you involved
in<i> any</i> way--

418
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:41,532
with the plans
to sabotage this station?

419
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:42,658
No, I wasn't involved.

420
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,284
You're sure
about that?

421
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:46,453
I can't help you unless
you tell me the truth.

422
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,998
I<i> am</i> telling you the truth.

423
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:52,043
The question is: Have<i> you</i>
been telling<i> me</i> the truth?

424
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:53,335
About what?

425
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,963
That the Bajorans
are wrong about you.

426
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:59,466
That you regret the horrible
things you had to do

427
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,594
during the occupation.

428
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:02,887
(<i> sighs</i> )

429
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:05,389
I do regret them, Ziyal...

430
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,058
deeply.

431
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:11,604
Then this is your chance
to prove it to everyone,

432
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,106
including me.

433
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:18,277
Show us that you're
capable of mercy.

434
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,240
(<i> sighs</i> )

435
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,657
Rom...

436
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,492
is an enemy of the state

437
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:29,205
and enemies of the state
do not deserve mercy.

438
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,749
(<i> sighs</i> )

439
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:34,501
Spoken like
a true Cardassian.

440
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:37,171
I<i> am</i> a Cardassian.

441
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:38,839
And so are you.

442
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,841
No, I'm not!

443
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,219
I could never
be like you.

444
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:44,762
Ziyal...

445
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,149
You can't trust them.

446
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:58,025
I trust latinum,
and so do they.

447
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,986
Five bars will buy me
five Nausicaans

448
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:03,447
and a fast ship
and very few questions.

449
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:04,907
Breaking Rom out
of the holding cell

450
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:06,366
will be child's play
compared to the things

451
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:07,451
they're used to doing.

452
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,410
Forget about it, Quark.

453
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,829
Freeing your brother's

454
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,831
going to take very careful
and precise planning.

455
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:14,208
It's not the Nausicaan way--
they're thugs.

456
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,210
They'll come strutting
onto the station,

457
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,045
look at a Jem'Hadar
the wrong way,

458
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,631
and before you know it,
there's blood on the Promenade.

459
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:24,135
Think I can get
my money back?

460
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,644
Major...

461
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:35,771
a freighter loaded
with Tammeron grain

462
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,148
is due within the hour.

463
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:38,482
See to it
that Cargo Bay 5

464
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:39,525
is ready to receive it.

465
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:40,609
I'll take care
of it.

466
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:41,694
I'll have a--

467
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:42,987
Yes, you will.

468
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:45,572
<i>Now.</i>

469
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,288
That attitude
of yours, Major...

470
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,498
it won't be
tolerated forever.

471
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:59,128
You don't like
my attitude, Damar?

472
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:02,298
You're welcome
to try to change it.

473
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:07,803
I don't know<i> what</i> Dukat
sees in that woman.

474
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,639
Then you need to have
your eyes examined.

475
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,849
One<i> kanar.</i>

476
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:13,934
Want me to leave
the bottle?

477
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,563
Maybe I should
have you taste it first.

478
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,481
Make sure
it isn't poisoned.

479
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,901
Poisoning the customers
is bad for business.

480
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,361
True.

481
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:25,905
But some people may place
a brother's revenge

482
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,365
above business.

483
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:31,369
Not this Ferengi.

484
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:32,786
(<i> chuckling</i> )

485
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:37,333
You're a credit
to your race, Quark.

486
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,709
Unlike your brother

487
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:41,212
you've chosen to back
the winning side.

488
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,882
All right,
you going to tell me

489
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:46,424
or do you want me
to guess?

490
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:47,676
Tell you what?

491
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:50,054
Oh, don't be coy with me.

492
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:52,181
Either someone
you don't like has died

493
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:54,141
or your promotion
came through.

494
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,935
It's better than that.

495
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:02,149
(<i> whispering</i> ):
It's about the minefield.

496
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,109
What about it?

497
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:04,360
It's coming down.

498
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,070
Oh, I've heard that before.

499
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,239
Remember those field tests
I was telling you about?

500
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:09,740
They were successful.

501
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,618
We've begun to deactivate
the mines.

502
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,494
Well...

503
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,330
you've got your work
cut out for you.

504
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,791
What's it going to take--
a couple months? A year?

505
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,084
One week.

506
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:21,335
A week?

507
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:23,421
That's right.

508
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:26,673
One week...

509
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:29,218
and the Alpha Quadrant
is ours.

510
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:43,983
Gentlemen,
this mission cannot succeed

511
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:46,944
without the involvement
of the Klingon Defense Forces.

512
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:48,237
We agree with you, Captain.

513
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:49,613
Chancellor Gowron does not.

514
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,115
Then you will have
to change his mind.

515
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:52,825
MARTOK:
The Chancellor
is reluctant

516
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:56,162
to commit such a large fleet
to a single engagement.

517
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:58,247
He believes it would leave
the Empire vulnerable.

518
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:01,499
Starfleet Command had
the same concerns about Earth.

519
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:03,710
But after careful consideration,
they decided

520
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,129
it was worth
the risk.

521
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:08,841
General, perhaps you should
return to Kronos

522
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,426
and make your plea
in person.

523
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,510
The Chancellor has
great respect for you.

524
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,638
If you cannot persuade
him, no one can.

525
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,768
I will go to see Gowron

526
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,187
and you will come with me.

527
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:23,689
No.

528
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,774
The Chancellor no longer
considers me a friend.

529
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,067
I know.

530
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,819
But what could be better?

531
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:32,656
An ally and an enemy both
telling him the same thing.

532
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:35,575
He'll have no other
choice but to agree.

533
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,744
Gentlemen, I need those ships.

534
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,500
And you shall have them.

535
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,649
A week?

536
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,610
Are you sure about that?

537
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,238
That's what
he said.

538
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:15,032
Believe me,
this was no idle boast.

539
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,285
We have to stop them.

540
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:21,497
And end up in a holding cell
like my brother?

541
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:22,998
No, thanks.

542
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,292
If we could only get to Odo...

543
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,753
make him see
what's going on.

544
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,755
Then maybe he could help us.

545
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:30,839
Forget about Odo.

546
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,551
First, we can't get to him.

547
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:35,761
Second, even if we did,
he wouldn't help us.

548
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:41,141
Then what we have to do
is warn Starfleet.

549
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,643
And how do you suggest
we get a message to them?

550
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:44,895
You're asking me?

551
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:46,021
You're the terrorist.

552
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,273
I'm just a bartender.

553
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:48,441
JAKE:
There you are.

554
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:50,859
From the look on your faces,

555
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,903
I can see you haven't
had much luck

556
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:54,154
getting Rom
out of jail.

557
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:56,323
And the news just keeps
getting worse.

558
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,741
It's not all bad.

559
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,785
Trust us, Jake.
It is.

560
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:01,287
Not for me.

561
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:04,957
I'm getting a message
out to my dad.

562
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,042
How?

563
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,295
I'm a reporter--
I have my ways.

564
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:11,464
Come on, Jake,
this is no time for games.

565
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,471
Morn?
He's going home

566
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:20,347
for his mother's birthday
or something.

567
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,974
He has an
encrypted message

568
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:23,601
for my dad
in one of her presents.

569
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,627
Are you sure
this is reliable?

570
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:51,878
I've known the courier
for five years.

571
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:52,838
I trust him.

572
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,672
Then we have a problem.

573
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:56,091
According to this,

574
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,636
the minefield's coming
down in three days.

575
00:27:58,636 --> 00:28:02,055
The Ninth Fleet won't be
here for at least four.

576
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:04,975
Then I suggest
we go without them.

577
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:06,893
What about the Klingons?

578
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:08,979
Looks like we go
without them, too.

579
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:10,814
We've run out
of time, Admiral.

580
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,690
If those Dominion
reinforcements

581
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,067
come through
the wormhole

582
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,735
we'll have lost
everything.

583
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,863
Then we take
the ships we have,

584
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,156
fight our way
to Deep Space 9,

585
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:20,866
and destroy
the anti-graviton emitter.

586
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,826
It's our<i> only</i> hope.

587
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:26,079
Do it.

588
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:39,176
There.

589
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:40,927
Where?
Over<i> there.</i>

590
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,262
That flash of light

591
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:45,641
was the anti-graviton beam
hitting a mine.

592
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:48,352
And disabling
its replication unit.

593
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:49,269
Exactly.

594
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,770
Didn't you see it?

595
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:53,273
I'm afraid not.

596
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,651
For months,
you've been demanding

597
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:57,611
that I take down those mines,

598
00:28:57,611 --> 00:29:00,113
and now that it's
finally happening,

599
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:01,823
you can't even see it.

600
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,909
Weak eyes.

601
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,452
Excuse me?

602
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,995
My people have poor eyesight.

603
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,414
It's something we've learned

604
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:09,373
to live with.

605
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:10,666
Jem'Hadar,

606
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,501
on the other hand--
excellent vision.

607
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:13,627
I suppose they need it

608
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:14,920
more than we do.

609
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,963
Ah! There's another one.

610
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:20,050
I'll have
to take your word for it.

611
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:24,555
Once we disable the replication
units in all the mines,

612
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:29,393
we can detonate
the entire minefield.

613
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:32,312
And I guarantee you--

614
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,607
weak eyes or not--

615
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:38,110
that explosion you will see.

616
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,696
When will you be ready
to proceed?

617
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:43,657
Approximately 78 hours.

618
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:46,076
Three more days,
and we can start to bring

619
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:49,121
the Jem'Hadar reinforcements
through the wormhole.

620
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:52,458
Excellent! I knew you
could do it, Dukat.

621
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:55,544
Did you?

622
00:29:57,379 --> 00:30:00,382
I never doubted you
for a moment.

623
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:01,883
Sir.

624
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:04,386
I have new information
on enemy fleet movements.

625
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:05,471
Go ahead.

626
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:06,639
The Second Fleet
has fallen back

627
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:07,598
past the Kotanka system

628
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:09,182
while the Fifth Fleet

629
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:12,227
has pulled out of the fighting
along the Vulcan border.

630
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,854
Both fleets have converged
here-- Starbase 375.

631
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:17,650
Isn't that where Captain Sisko
is stationed?

632
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,067
He's been made an adjutant

633
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,737
to Admiral Ross.
Good for him.

634
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,363
Now, why have those fleets

635
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:24,281
gathered there?

636
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:25,324
I'm not sure.

637
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:26,325
You're not sure?

638
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,034
Two large enemy fleets

639
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:30,704
break off from the front lines
and rendezvous at a starbase

640
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:32,164
and you have no idea why?

641
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:37,127
Well, we'll just have
to find out, won't we?

642
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:38,878
See that you do.

643
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:43,467
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

644
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:46,219
He should speak to you
with greater respect.

645
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,763
(<i> chuckles</i> )

646
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:51,057
Someday, I'll let you
teach him that lesson,

647
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:53,185
but right now,
there's something

648
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:56,229
more pressing
I need you to do.

649
00:30:56,229 --> 00:31:02,486
It's of a personal nature,
a matter of some... delicacy.

650
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:04,488
It's about my daughter.

651
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:05,823
Ziyal?

652
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:09,493
We've had a misunderstanding.

653
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:13,372
I want you to go
and convince her to...

654
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,708
speak with me.

655
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:17,209
Sir, I really feel

656
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:20,128
I would be more valuable
tracking the enemy fleet.

657
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,797
I've given you an order, Damar.

658
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:23,507
We're on the verge

659
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:26,301
of a great victory,

660
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:33,016
and when it comes,
I want my daughter at my side.

661
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,727
Is that understood?

662
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:42,609
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

663
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:51,702
I really believed
my father had changed.

664
00:31:51,702 --> 00:31:54,454
That he wanted
to be a man of peace.

665
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,498
I think he believes
that, too--

666
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:59,459
when it suits
his purpose.

667
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:02,254
Everything he's ever said
to me has been a lie.

668
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:03,380
Not everything.

669
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:06,341
He really does
care about you.

670
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,718
I don't care.

671
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:09,636
I am not going
back to him.

672
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:13,014
You don't
believe me, do you?

673
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,391
(<i> sighs</i> )

674
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:16,226
Right now, you're
angry and hurt,

675
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:17,686
but that's going to pass

676
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:20,272
and then you'll have
to decide what to do.

677
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:21,440
Ziyal!

678
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,775
I need to speak to you.

679
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:24,777
You and I have nothing
to talk about.

680
00:32:24,777 --> 00:32:27,987
Maybe not,
but you and your father do.

681
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:29,615
He wants to see you.

682
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:31,658
Well, I don't
want to see him.

683
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,287
You heard her.

684
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:36,789
Stay out of this, Major.

685
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:38,707
Ziyal, listen.

686
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:40,417
Your father
is a great man--

687
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:43,879
a man of destiny--
but he also carries
great burdens.

688
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:46,548
He knows our alliance
with the Dominion
is a dangerous one.

689
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:50,719
If we show any sign
of weakness,
our allies will turn on us.

690
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:53,346
That is why we must all
help him remain strong.

691
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,933
So I ask you to be
a true daughter of Cardassia

692
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:57,225
and stand beside him.

693
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,436
It should be obvious,
even to you, Damar

694
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:03,064
that I am not "a true
daughter of Cardassia"!

695
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,191
What is obvious to me
is that your father

696
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:07,861
should have left you to rot
in that Breen prison camp.

697
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:08,946
But he didn't.

698
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:10,447
He took pity on you

699
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:11,615
and it's your duty to repay him.

700
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:12,616
Now come with me.

701
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:13,700
Let her go.

702
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:17,454
And if I don't?

703
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:18,747
What happens, then?

704
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:21,374
I was hoping you'd ask.

705
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:32,135
(<i> grunts</i> )

706
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:36,348
(<i> panting</i> )

707
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:37,724
Did you kill him?

708
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:40,477
No, but I thought
about it.

709
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:43,772
What are you going to do
when he wakes up?

710
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:45,231
That's up to him.

711
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:03,667
I just came
to wish you luck.

712
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:05,293
Oh, thank you.

713
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,461
My father says

714
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,588
you can never have
too much good luck.

715
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,841
Your father sounds
like a wise man.

716
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:13,051
And he makes
a fierce jambalaya.

717
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,761
(<i> chuckles</i> )

718
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,179
What's this?

719
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:19,432
Ancient Bajoran texts.

720
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,894
Ah. The Emissary
looks for guidance

721
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:23,436
on the eve of battle.

722
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:27,399
Guidance, insights,
loopholes--

723
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,526
I'll take
anything I can get.

724
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:32,111
And what do the
Prophets tell you?

725
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:35,782
That I have
a long way to go

726
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:38,827
before I can make any sense
of their prophecies.

727
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:44,249
Maybe when this war is over,
you can look at them closer.

728
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:46,209
That would be a change.

729
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,879
Spend a week or two
down on Bajor.

730
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,881
Visit the Dakeen Monastery.

731
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:52,173
I've never
been on Bajor.

732
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,676
I hear it's
quite nice.

733
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:56,720
Nice?

734
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,681
That hardly describes it at all.

735
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:02,017
There are parts
of the Eastern Province

736
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:03,936
that are like Eden itself--

737
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:06,563
lush green valleys
covered in wildflowers

738
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:08,607
that seem to spring
up overnight;

739
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:10,901
hundreds of small,
crystal-clear ponds

740
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:13,570
interconnected
by waterfalls...

741
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,447
All right, all right.
I'm convinced.

742
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:18,909
I'm already planning
my next R&amp;R down there.

743
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:21,411
You know, it sounds like,
when your assignment

744
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:22,788
on Deep Space 9 is over

745
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:25,082
and Bajor is welcomed
into the Federation,

746
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:27,918
you're going to have
a tough time saying good-bye.

747
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:30,253
I don't plan to say good-bye.

748
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:35,634
I plan to build
a house on Bajor.

749
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:36,969
And what if Starfleet

750
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:39,345
assigns you
to a different sector?

751
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:42,181
I will go
wherever they send me,

752
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:43,683
but when I go home...

753
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:48,105
it will be to Bajor.

754
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,075
(<i> sighs</i> )

755
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,871
Chief! I was
just coming to see you.

756
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,123
Can you believe it?

757
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:07,582
They made me an Ensign.

758
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,417
I hadn't realized things
were going so bad.

759
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,044
Scary, isn't it?

760
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:12,420
If my classmates
at the Academy

761
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,588
could only see me now.

762
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:14,673
They'd be surprised,
would they?

763
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:15,882
"Amazed" is
more like it.

764
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:16,883
What do they know?

765
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:17,968
Anyway, I just
want to say

766
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:19,094
thanks for
all your help.

767
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:20,137
My help?

768
00:36:20,137 --> 00:36:21,847
I've learned
a lot from you

769
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:23,098
and not just
about engineering.

770
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:24,223
You've shown me
what it takes

771
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,517
to be a good soldier.

772
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,435
Don't let that uniform
go to your head.

773
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,521
You've a lot
to learn yet...

774
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,148
and you will.

775
00:36:31,148 --> 00:36:32,858
Congratulations, Ensign.

776
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:34,109
Wear it
with pride.

777
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:35,568
I intend to, Chief.

778
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:42,075
Captain
on the Bridge.

779
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,372
I've kept it warm
for you, Ben.

780
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,256
Ensign, alert all ships.

781
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,717
We're moving out.

782
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,677
Aye, sir.

783
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:16,818
Our initial
intelligence reports

784
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:18,653
have been verified.

785
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,656
The Federation fleet
<i>is</i> on the move.

786
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,158
Do we know
their destination?

787
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:24,743
Yes. It appears
they're headed here.

788
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:26,161
Here?

789
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:27,662
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

790
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:31,624
He knows we're taking down
the minefield.

791
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,835
Someone must've gotten
a message out.

792
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:36,129
So it would seem.

793
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:37,589
No matter.

794
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:39,591
We'll crush them.

795
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:42,427
Yes. Yes, we will

796
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:45,013
but in order to do that,
I'm going to have to pull

797
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:47,015
a significant
number of our ships

798
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:48,433
off the front lines.

799
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:49,559
Do it.

800
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:51,019
(<i> door chimes</i> )
Come in.

801
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:52,729
Once the minefield is down,

802
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:53,813
we'll have more
than enough ships

803
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,107
to take their place.

804
00:37:57,234 --> 00:37:59,611
I understand.

805
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,571
One moment, please.

806
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:09,162
I want your permission
to arrest Major Kira.

807
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:11,289
Kira? What about Ziyal?

808
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,331
Did you talk to her?

809
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,583
She doesn't want
to see you.

810
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:16,711
When I insisted,
the Major... objected.

811
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,546
What did you
do to Ziyal?

812
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:19,714
I did nothing to her.

813
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,507
Then why did the
Major attack you?

814
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,551
You must have
done something...

815
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,095
threatened my daughter
in some way.

816
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:27,680
Damar, I told you
to be tactful.

817
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,766
Excuse me.

818
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:32,018
Don't you think
resolving family squabbles

819
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:35,230
can wait until after
we've won this war?

820
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:39,567
Weak eyes, good ears.

821
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:42,070
Yes, of course.
You're quite right.

822
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,947
Then you're clear
on what must be done?

823
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:45,323
I'm going
to call back

824
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,660
enough ships to destroy
the Federation fleet

825
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,411
and hold this station.

826
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,876
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

827
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,462
The Federation is
moving against us?
That's right.

828
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:03,800
Now, I want to know
exactly what went on
between you and Ziyal.

829
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,057
It's odd.

830
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:13,601
I've stood here
countless times

831
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:16,855
and yet, somehow it
all looks different.

832
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:19,065
It's the solids.

833
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:21,693
They look small,
don't they?

834
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:23,486
Insignificant.

835
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,864
It's not their fault.

836
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:28,283
I'm not placing blame.

837
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:30,285
They're trapped.

838
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:33,496
Confined to a single shape.

839
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,665
A single perspective.

840
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:38,251
It's so limiting.

841
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:42,505
I feel sorry for them.

842
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:45,258
They need
our guidance, Odo

843
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:47,260
not our pity.

844
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,470
They cherish their freedom.

845
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,473
We'll have to break
them of that.

846
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,642
Break them?

847
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,811
In a manner of speaking.

848
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:59,772
Oh, this language
of the solids--

849
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,649
it's so imprecise.

850
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:05,695
What exactly do
you plan to do?

851
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:09,199
The solids are no longer
your concern, Odo.

852
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:12,077
What must be done
will be done.

853
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:14,162
It's as simple as that.

854
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,789
Forgive me for intruding

855
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:19,709
but I have important news
about the war.

856
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:22,254
Why don't you return
to your quarters, Odo?

857
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:24,089
I'll join
you there shortly.

858
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:30,469
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

859
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:32,471
I promise.

860
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,689
I must say...

861
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:45,443
you're doing a
wonderful job with Odo.

862
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,363
Meaning what?

863
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:49,739
Meaning that he's
always posed

864
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:51,199
a potential threat
to our plans

865
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,743
but you seem to have...

866
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:55,954
neutralized him
quite nicely.

867
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:57,414
Neutralize Odo?

868
00:40:57,414 --> 00:40:59,457
Is that why you think I'm here?

869
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:02,252
Odo is
a changeling.

870
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:05,130
Bringing him home,
returning him to the Great Link

871
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:08,925
means more to us
than the Alpha Quadrant itself.

872
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:10,635
Is that clear?

873
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:12,637
I meant no disrespect.

874
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:14,680
Well, of course you didn't.

875
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,308
You are what you are--

876
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:18,684
a loyal subject
of the Dominion.

877
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:20,103
Come. Walk with me.

878
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:22,563
You said you had
important news.

879
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:41,958
Major!

880
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,550
Kira!

881
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,593
Kira, wait, please.

882
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,179
I have nothing
to say to you.

883
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:55,221
I understand
that you're angry.

884
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,806
Oh, you bet
I am angry.

885
00:41:56,806 --> 00:41:58,557
Do you have any idea
what's going on?

886
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:00,185
Yes... somewhat.

887
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:01,602
I've been occupied.

888
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:04,772
Ah... Dukat is bringing
down the minefield.

889
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,732
The Federation is
about to be overrun

890
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:08,109
by Dominion
reinforcements

891
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:10,195
and Weyoun has ordered
Rom's execution

892
00:42:10,195 --> 00:42:12,113
and you have
been<i> occupied.</i>

893
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:13,614
This is so difficult
to explain.

894
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:14,907
If you're going
to talk to me

895
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:15,992
about the Link,
don't bother.

896
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:16,993
I'm a solid, remember?

897
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:18,077
I won't understand.

898
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,120
Nerys...

899
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,540
I'm sorry.

900
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,750
Sorry?

901
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,461
That's what you wanted
to tell me?

902
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:27,753
You're sorry?

903
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:29,172
Yes.

904
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:31,049
Well, let me
tell you something, Odo.

905
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:34,927
We are way,<i> way</i> past "sorry."

906
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,737
O'BRIEN:
Sir, incoming message
from the<i> Cortéz.</i>

907
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:54,364
They're still having
trouble stabilizing

908
00:42:54,364 --> 00:42:56,366
the guidance thrusters
on the port nacelle.

909
00:42:56,366 --> 00:42:58,159
Tell them to drop back
and make repairs.

910
00:42:58,159 --> 00:42:59,952
Bring up the<i> Sarek</i>
to take its place.

911
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:00,995
Will do.

912
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,330
That's the 11th ship

913
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:03,831
to fall out of formation.

914
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,583
Nice of you
to keep track, Garak.

915
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,126
He can't help being negative.

916
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,294
It's in his nature.

917
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:10,255
On the contrary.

918
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:11,964
I always hope for the best.

919
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:13,758
Experience, unfortunately,

920
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:16,052
has taught me
to expect the worst.

921
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:18,555
I'm picking something up.

922
00:43:18,555 --> 00:43:20,806
It's a large
Dominion fleet

923
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:23,309
bearing 004 mark 009.

924
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:24,810
How large?

925
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:27,188
1,254 ships.

926
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:29,315
They outnumber us two to one.

927
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,692
Now who's being negative?

928
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:33,652
Ensign, on screen.

929
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:35,196
Maximum magnification.

930
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:36,614
NOG:
Aye, sir.

931
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,294
(<i> communications beep</i> )

932
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:50,920
To all ships--

933
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,630
this is Captain Sisko.

934
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,425
Assume attack formation
delta-two.

935
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:57,385
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

936
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,976
There's an old saying--

937
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:07,395
"Fortune favors the bold."

938
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:10,773
Well...

939
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:13,985
I guess we're
about to find out.
