1
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,421
That is the worst mug shot
I have ever seen.

2
00:00:27,457 --> 00:00:30,055
I have never understood
why law enforcement agencies

3
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:31,566
don't keep
better visual records.

4
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,037
You'd think they'd be concerned
about little things

5
00:00:34,074 --> 00:00:37,172
like making
an accurate identification.

6
00:00:37,214 --> 00:00:38,808
The picture is accurate enough

7
00:00:38,851 --> 00:00:42,850
to establish that your customer
is Regana Tosh

8
00:00:42,894 --> 00:00:44,454
who is known to be associated

9
00:00:44,498 --> 00:00:46,526
with a Markalian
smuggling operation.

10
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:51,276
Really? Well, everyone
is welcome at Quark's.

11
00:00:51,315 --> 00:00:52,784
I don't discriminate.

12
00:00:52,818 --> 00:00:55,848
Just like Starfleet.

13
00:00:55,892 --> 00:00:57,692
They have a nondiscrimination
policy, too

14
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:58,960
don't they, Commander?

15
00:00:58,999 --> 00:01:01,938
I guess we have
something in common.

16
00:01:01,974 --> 00:01:03,443
You have more in common

17
00:01:03,477 --> 00:01:05,948
with a Rakonian swamp rat,
Quark.

18
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:09,685
Major. Always a delight
to see you here.

19
00:01:09,725 --> 00:01:10,921
What can I get for you?

20
00:01:10,961 --> 00:01:12,020
Tarkalean tea.

21
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:17,307
But not, not too sweet
this time.

22
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:23,852
Catching up on some work?

23
00:01:23,892 --> 00:01:25,191
Not exactly.

24
00:01:31,845 --> 00:01:33,314
That man arrived on the station

25
00:01:33,382 --> 00:01:35,876
this afternoon
and came directly here.

26
00:01:35,921 --> 00:01:40,922
I believe the Ferengi bartender
is plotting something with him.

27
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:42,995
I wouldn't be surprised.

28
00:01:43,038 --> 00:01:44,906
Quark's always up to something.

29
00:01:44,943 --> 00:01:46,503
If he is a known criminal

30
00:01:46,547 --> 00:01:49,851
why does your Security Chief
not do anything about him?

31
00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:51,358
Odo keeps him in check.

32
00:01:51,392 --> 00:01:54,229
Yes.

33
00:01:54,266 --> 00:01:56,703
But not in prison.

34
00:01:56,738 --> 00:02:01,181
Medical Officer's Log,
Stardate 49066.5.

35
00:02:01,215 --> 00:02:03,949
Chief O'Brien and I have
concluded our bio-survey

36
00:02:03,988 --> 00:02:06,620
of Merik III
in the Gamma Quadrant.

37
00:02:06,662 --> 00:02:08,325
We are on course
back to the wormhole

38
00:02:08,365 --> 00:02:11,099
and should arrive at the station
two days ahead of schedule.

39
00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:14,636
Keiko only spends a few days
at a time on the station.

40
00:02:14,681 --> 00:02:17,245
I'm the one living
in those quarters.

41
00:02:17,287 --> 00:02:18,722
And if I want to set up

42
00:02:18,757 --> 00:02:20,921
a little workshop
in the bedroom...

43
00:02:20,963 --> 00:02:23,993
You set up a workshop
in the bedroom?

44
00:02:24,036 --> 00:02:25,369
Yeah.

45
00:02:25,473 --> 00:02:27,238
Well, I don't use it
when she's visiting.

46
00:02:27,278 --> 00:02:28,337
Oh, of course not.

47
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,478
She says I'm trying to live
"like a bachelor again"

48
00:02:31,521 --> 00:02:34,722
that I'm expressing
a "subconscious desire"

49
00:02:34,762 --> 00:02:37,256
to push her out of our quarters.

50
00:02:37,302 --> 00:02:39,239
Now that is ridiculous.

51
00:02:39,273 --> 00:02:40,367
That's what I said.

52
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:42,778
I mean, if anything

53
00:02:42,815 --> 00:02:44,945
by spending your free time
in the bedroom...

54
00:02:44,987 --> 00:02:47,288
a place you intimately associate
with Keiko...

55
00:02:47,326 --> 00:02:49,958
you are actually expressing

56
00:02:49,999 --> 00:02:54,807
a desire to be closer to her
during her absence.

57
00:02:54,843 --> 00:02:56,814
It's quite touching, really.

58
00:02:56,848 --> 00:02:59,446
Exactly. Exactly!

59
00:02:59,522 --> 00:03:01,789
See, you understand.

60
00:03:01,827 --> 00:03:03,353
Why can't she see that?

61
00:03:03,397 --> 00:03:05,664
Why can't she be more like...

62
00:03:07,674 --> 00:03:09,234
More like?

63
00:03:12,653 --> 00:03:14,681
Well, a man.

64
00:03:14,725 --> 00:03:16,319
More like a man.

65
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:20,435
So...

66
00:03:20,472 --> 00:03:22,739
you wish...

67
00:03:22,777 --> 00:03:24,680
Keiko was a man.

68
00:03:27,322 --> 00:03:29,920
I wish I was on this trip
with someone else.

69
00:03:29,962 --> 00:03:30,930
That's what I wish.

70
00:03:34,037 --> 00:03:37,169
We're picking up a subspace
magneton pulse.

71
00:03:37,212 --> 00:03:39,946
Bearing 090, mark 115.

72
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:42,253
The Bopak system.

73
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,194
What's a magneton pulse?

74
00:03:44,228 --> 00:03:46,461
It's a burst of polarized
magnetic energy.

75
00:03:46,501 --> 00:03:48,631
It's usually produced
by a damaged warp core.

76
00:03:48,673 --> 00:03:50,267
So there could be
a ship in trouble?

77
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,278
Possibly.

78
00:03:51,312 --> 00:03:53,249
Let's take a look.

79
00:03:57,294 --> 00:04:00,757
I'm having trouble pinpointing
the source of the plasma surge.

80
00:04:00,802 --> 00:04:03,035
Too much EM interference
in the atmosphere

81
00:04:03,074 --> 00:04:05,638
but it's definitely
down there somewhere.

82
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,710
According to our records,
Bopak III is uninhabited.

83
00:04:08,754 --> 00:04:10,918
The nearest Dominion outpost
is six weeks away

84
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,431
and this system is well off
the established trade routes

85
00:04:13,465 --> 00:04:14,455
in the Gamma Quadrant.

86
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:15,970
Strange place for a ship

87
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,101
to set down, even if it was
having engine trouble.

88
00:04:18,143 --> 00:04:20,741
Of course, it could be
an anomalous reading

89
00:04:20,783 --> 00:04:22,777
but I'd feel a lot better
if we could...

90
00:04:22,821 --> 00:04:24,415
Hold on.

91
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:26,794
There's some kind
of energy surge on...

92
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,031
Wha-What the hell?

93
00:04:30,072 --> 00:04:31,371
We've been hit
by a plasma field.

94
00:04:31,408 --> 00:04:32,775
We're losing main power.

95
00:04:32,811 --> 00:04:34,474
Switching to auxiliary units.

96
00:04:34,516 --> 00:04:37,045
The field's draining our power.

97
00:04:37,088 --> 00:04:38,182
I can't break free.

98
00:04:38,225 --> 00:04:39,524
We're losing altitude.

99
00:04:39,561 --> 00:04:41,224
Send out a distress call.

100
00:04:41,265 --> 00:04:42,529
I'll try and get us

101
00:04:42,568 --> 00:04:44,231
down in one piece.

102
00:04:44,272 --> 00:04:45,571
And the com system jammed!

103
00:04:46,645 --> 00:04:48,410
I'm reading a clearing up ahead.

104
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:49,577
I think we can make it.

105
00:04:49,686 --> 00:04:50,711
Hold on.

106
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:30,383
What a lovely place.

107
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,764
Smells like a garbage dump.

108
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,643
I'm sorry I couldn't find
a nicer place to crash-land.

109
00:05:42,712 --> 00:05:44,341
Well, should we try again?

110
00:05:50,063 --> 00:05:51,464
Do not move.

111
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,064
You are prisoners
of the Jem'Hadar.

112
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:03,252
Are there other Starfleet
ships with you?

113
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,808
Tell me.

114
00:08:08,842 --> 00:08:11,474
There are no other ships with
us, but if we don't return

115
00:08:11,515 --> 00:08:13,246
Starfleet will begin
looking for us.

116
00:08:13,287 --> 00:08:14,449
When?

117
00:08:14,489 --> 00:08:15,685
Soon.

118
00:08:15,725 --> 00:08:17,593
You're lying.

119
00:08:20,136 --> 00:08:21,104
No other crew.

120
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:22,608
Standard Danube-class runabout.

121
00:08:22,642 --> 00:08:23,610
Some modification

122
00:08:23,644 --> 00:08:25,706
to the phaser array
and shield generators.

123
00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:27,309
Why were you
in this star system?

124
00:08:27,353 --> 00:08:28,720
We picked up a magneton pulse.

125
00:08:28,756 --> 00:08:30,248
We thought there might be a ship

126
00:08:30,293 --> 00:08:31,592
in trouble,
so we altered our course...

127
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,724
Return to the ship.

128
00:08:32,766 --> 00:08:34,862
Put a damping field
on our warp engine.

129
00:08:37,845 --> 00:08:40,043
Human.

130
00:08:40,084 --> 00:08:42,180
Gold uniform indicates
a specialty

131
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:43,953
in security or engineering.

132
00:08:43,994 --> 00:08:46,728
Rank: Chief Petty Officer.

133
00:08:46,766 --> 00:08:49,637
You are what Starfleet
refers to as a "noncom."

134
00:08:49,674 --> 00:08:51,645
That's right.

135
00:08:51,678 --> 00:08:54,115
You must have a great deal
of experience.

136
00:08:54,151 --> 00:08:55,780
I've been around.

137
00:08:55,888 --> 00:08:57,414
That makes you
a priority target.

138
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:58,654
We will kill you first.

139
00:09:01,937 --> 00:09:03,965
Human, rank of Lieutenant

140
00:09:04,008 --> 00:09:06,742
with a specialty
in the sciences.

141
00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:09,014
Doctor, actually.

142
00:09:09,054 --> 00:09:13,156
Science and medical officers
are low-priority targets.

143
00:09:13,196 --> 00:09:14,927
I submit we execute this one

144
00:09:14,968 --> 00:09:17,600
and use the other
in a tactical exercise.

145
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:20,773
No.

146
00:09:20,815 --> 00:09:22,843
Bring them both back to camp.

147
00:09:26,528 --> 00:09:27,690
Move.

148
00:09:31,106 --> 00:09:34,808
We cannot allow him to continue
these criminal activities.

149
00:09:34,849 --> 00:09:37,320
I am fully aware
of Quark's activities

150
00:09:37,354 --> 00:09:39,450
and I'm conducting
a thorough investigation

151
00:09:39,493 --> 00:09:41,293
of his connection
with the smuggler.

152
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,598
If you'll excuse me, Captain.

153
00:09:43,636 --> 00:09:45,401
Of course.

154
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,689
I know Odo may do things

155
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:55,323
a little differently
than you're used to

156
00:09:55,364 --> 00:09:58,030
but he really is
very good at his job.

157
00:09:58,071 --> 00:10:00,542
I'm not questioning
his competence.

158
00:10:00,577 --> 00:10:04,679
How many years were you
in security, Commander?

159
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,745
Seven.

160
00:10:05,789 --> 00:10:08,022
Must be a hard habit to break.

161
00:10:08,061 --> 00:10:10,032
I remain vigilant.

162
00:10:10,066 --> 00:10:14,634
And I do encourage vigilance
in my officers.

163
00:10:14,677 --> 00:10:16,580
But remember...

164
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:20,317
Odo is Chief of Security
on this station

165
00:10:20,357 --> 00:10:22,921
and you're the Strategic
Operations Officer.

166
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,865
Your primary duty

167
00:10:24,902 --> 00:10:26,496
is to coordinate
all Starfleet activity

168
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:30,481
in this sector,
not to catch smugglers.

169
00:10:30,515 --> 00:10:32,645
Understood.

170
00:10:32,687 --> 00:10:35,353
I will not let this matter
interfere with my duties.

171
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,592
Very well.
Dismissed.

172
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:50,419
Does he look nervous to you?

173
00:10:50,462 --> 00:10:52,865
A bit distracted, yeah.

174
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,394
And at the runabout

175
00:10:54,439 --> 00:10:56,410
they seemed concerned
about being found here.

176
00:10:56,444 --> 00:10:57,412
Something's going on.

177
00:10:57,446 --> 00:10:58,414
I'd hate to think

178
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,420
what would make
the Jem'Hadar jumpy.

179
00:11:00,453 --> 00:11:02,617
They need a doctor.

180
00:11:02,658 --> 00:11:05,426
Someone's injured or sick.

181
00:11:06,902 --> 00:11:09,305
If that's true, Julian,
don't help them.

182
00:11:09,342 --> 00:11:10,902
Anything that weakens them

183
00:11:10,945 --> 00:11:13,041
increases our chances
of getting out of here.

184
00:11:16,993 --> 00:11:18,428
Come with me.

185
00:11:21,437 --> 00:11:23,202
He stays.

186
00:11:51,443 --> 00:11:53,277
You will work here.

187
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:56,820
Where are the patients?

188
00:11:56,855 --> 00:11:58,849
There are no patients.

189
00:11:58,893 --> 00:12:01,661
You are here to carry out
scientific research for us.

190
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,933
If you refuse,
I will have to kill you.

191
00:12:03,972 --> 00:12:05,168
Do you understand?

192
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:07,680
And you need to understand
that I'm a Starfleet officer

193
00:12:07,714 --> 00:12:08,910
and I won't do any work for you

194
00:12:08,951 --> 00:12:11,047
that might potentially be
used against the Federation

195
00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:12,490
or any other race,
for that matter.

196
00:12:12,526 --> 00:12:16,491
Now, if that's what you want,
you'll have to kill me.

197
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:21,036
Fortunately for you, weapons
research is not what I need.

198
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,381
There is a drug...

199
00:12:25,624 --> 00:12:30,192
that all Jem'Hadar must have
in order to live.

200
00:12:30,235 --> 00:12:33,971
We call it ketracel-white.

201
00:12:34,011 --> 00:12:35,811
An isogenic enzyme.

202
00:12:37,786 --> 00:12:39,551
You know about it?

203
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:42,758
I know that the Jem'Hadar
have been genetically engineered

204
00:12:42,798 --> 00:12:46,102
by the Dominion to be addicted
to what you call ketracel-white.

205
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,475
And that by controlling
the supply of this drug

206
00:12:48,512 --> 00:12:50,312
the Founders
maintain control over you.

207
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:55,819
The Vorta, they are the ones
who control the drug.

208
00:12:59,873 --> 00:13:03,040
They are the ones
we came here to escape.

209
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:04,448
Escape?

210
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:07,651
You're trying
to leave the Dominion?

211
00:13:07,691 --> 00:13:08,750
Yes.

212
00:13:10,565 --> 00:13:12,536
You disapprove.

213
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:13,664
No. I...

214
00:13:13,706 --> 00:13:17,648
I'm just... just surprised.

215
00:13:17,682 --> 00:13:19,653
Surprised
because a Jem'Hadar soldier

216
00:13:19,687 --> 00:13:22,524
might want something more
than the life of a slave?

217
00:13:24,331 --> 00:13:27,567
You know nothing
about the Jem'Hadar

218
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:31,571
except that you fear us.

219
00:13:31,616 --> 00:13:34,350
But...

220
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:39,663
you will make our final escape
from the Dominion possible.

221
00:13:39,702 --> 00:13:45,114
We have only enough white
to last another five days.

222
00:13:47,287 --> 00:13:51,229
And you want me to try
and synthesize this drug?

223
00:13:51,329 --> 00:13:55,635
No. We do not want
more of the drug.

224
00:13:55,673 --> 00:13:58,373
We want to be free of it...

225
00:13:58,413 --> 00:14:00,646
to break the addiction.

226
00:14:00,685 --> 00:14:03,681
I'm not sure
that that's possible.

227
00:14:03,726 --> 00:14:05,594
It is possible.

228
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:10,597
I know, because I am
free of the drug.

229
00:14:13,249 --> 00:14:15,778
No supply tube.

230
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:17,552
I don't understand.

231
00:14:17,592 --> 00:14:19,563
Your entire genetic structure

232
00:14:19,597 --> 00:14:22,068
was designed to collapse
without the ketracel.

233
00:14:22,103 --> 00:14:24,837
Why did you stop
taking the drug?

234
00:14:26,981 --> 00:14:29,111
It was not by choice.

235
00:14:32,127 --> 00:14:34,598
Three years ago

236
00:14:34,633 --> 00:14:37,800
I was on a ship
that crashed on this world.

237
00:14:37,841 --> 00:14:40,541
The rest of the crew died,
and I was left

238
00:14:40,581 --> 00:14:44,044
with only enough white
to sustain me for three days.

239
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:47,530
I rationed my supply
and managed

240
00:14:47,564 --> 00:14:49,865
to stretch the drug out
for eight days

241
00:14:49,903 --> 00:14:52,933
and then it was gone

242
00:14:52,977 --> 00:14:57,147
and I was ready to die.

243
00:14:57,187 --> 00:15:02,097
But death never came.

244
00:15:02,132 --> 00:15:05,937
I lived here...

245
00:15:05,975 --> 00:15:10,509
for 35 days without
a single drop of white.

246
00:15:10,553 --> 00:15:16,082
Being here,
on this planet, cured me.

247
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:18,949
So that's why you
returned here...

248
00:15:18,989 --> 00:15:21,791
to cure the rest
of your men as well.

249
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:23,264
But it hasn't worked, has it?

250
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:24,563
They still need the drug.

251
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:35,321
We have come to the same place,
breathed the same air

252
00:15:35,361 --> 00:15:39,360
eaten the same food... it should
have cured them as well.

253
00:15:39,404 --> 00:15:43,346
That may be oversimplifying
the situation.

254
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,180
There may be many factors...

255
00:15:45,218 --> 00:15:46,847
I want you to see this.

256
00:15:59,352 --> 00:16:00,878
Take the pain.

257
00:16:00,922 --> 00:16:03,486
Show Goran'Agar
we're still Jem'Hadar.

258
00:16:19,566 --> 00:16:21,160
You did not fall.

259
00:16:21,204 --> 00:16:23,107
Feel pride in that.

260
00:16:30,827 --> 00:16:32,798
As a Federation doctor

261
00:16:32,832 --> 00:16:35,099
I know you are trained
to feel sympathy

262
00:16:35,137 --> 00:16:37,335
and compassion
for those in pain.

263
00:16:37,376 --> 00:16:40,247
These men are suffering now

264
00:16:40,283 --> 00:16:43,188
but it is nothing compared
to what will happen

265
00:16:43,224 --> 00:16:46,061
if they are not freed
from the drug

266
00:16:46,098 --> 00:16:48,262
before our supply runs out.

267
00:16:48,303 --> 00:16:50,797
I can't promise anything.

268
00:16:50,842 --> 00:16:52,710
Will you try?

269
00:16:52,747 --> 00:16:56,153
I'll need Chief O'Brien's help.

270
00:16:56,188 --> 00:16:59,093
Yes, I'll try.

271
00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:01,225
Now give those men
what they need, please.

272
00:17:09,353 --> 00:17:10,879
Second.

273
00:17:27,162 --> 00:17:31,161
I've told them we have
enough white to last 27 days.

274
00:17:31,206 --> 00:17:33,302
That is a lie.

275
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:36,010
There's only enough
to last five days.

276
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,247
You have that long, Doctor.

277
00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:40,157
After that, they will die

278
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:43,759
but not before they kill me
for betraying them

279
00:17:43,802 --> 00:17:47,835
and you for not saving them.

280
00:17:53,993 --> 00:17:55,622
The Klingons have also attacked

281
00:17:55,664 --> 00:17:58,228
three more outposts
along the Romulan border.

282
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,366
In short, they're
reasserting themselves

283
00:18:00,408 --> 00:18:02,504
all over the Quadrant.

284
00:18:02,547 --> 00:18:04,210
You'd think they'd be
a little less aggressive

285
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:05,550
after failing
to conquer Cardassia.

286
00:18:05,588 --> 00:18:07,023
If the invasion was seen

287
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:10,257
as a failure, Gowron would have
been assassinated by now.

288
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:12,793
He simply declared victory
and returned home.

289
00:18:12,838 --> 00:18:15,868
Now he's looking
for his next victory.

290
00:18:15,912 --> 00:18:17,883
Bajoran Intelligence

291
00:18:17,917 --> 00:18:20,047
believes the Klingons
are searching for weaknesses

292
00:18:20,156 --> 00:18:21,956
in the star systems
along their borders.

293
00:18:21,994 --> 00:18:25,024
And when they find
an appropriately weak system

294
00:18:25,068 --> 00:18:26,036
they invade.

295
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,060
It's the same old story...

296
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:28,938
the strong survive,
and the weak perish.

297
00:18:28,977 --> 00:18:32,383
We'll save that particular
debate for another time.

298
00:18:32,418 --> 00:18:34,855
I want a complete briefing
every day

299
00:18:34,891 --> 00:18:36,862
about the Klingon situation.

300
00:18:36,895 --> 00:18:38,558
Dismissed.

301
00:18:41,741 --> 00:18:43,267
May I speak with you a moment?

302
00:18:43,311 --> 00:18:46,843
I assume this is about Quark.

303
00:18:46,886 --> 00:18:49,688
He has made arrangements
to acquire a type IV

304
00:18:49,726 --> 00:18:51,127
Tallonian microscanner.

305
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:52,131
Has he?

306
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,499
The type IV is primarily

307
00:18:53,536 --> 00:18:56,338
used to determine the purity
of Tallonian crystals.

308
00:18:57,378 --> 00:18:59,143
Which are illegal anywhere

309
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,414
but on the Tallonian
homeworld.

310
00:19:01,455 --> 00:19:02,423
Interesting.

311
00:19:02,457 --> 00:19:06,456
I appreciate you bringing me
this information, Commander.

312
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,696
I expect him to be meeting

313
00:19:07,737 --> 00:19:09,434
with the smuggler again
this evening.

314
00:19:09,474 --> 00:19:11,000
That would seem likely.

315
00:19:11,044 --> 00:19:12,513
You will arrest him when...

316
00:19:12,548 --> 00:19:13,778
Thank you, Mr. Worf.

317
00:19:13,818 --> 00:19:17,054
Rest assured I'll take
care of this matter.

318
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,885
How long until that
scanner's ready, Chief?

319
00:19:29,923 --> 00:19:33,159
Uh, about 30 minutes.

320
00:19:33,264 --> 00:19:37,536
I'm having trouble
with the transtater interface.

321
00:19:37,574 --> 00:19:39,568
Maybe you should
take a look, sir.

322
00:19:45,426 --> 00:19:47,693
The plasma charge will have

323
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:49,727
an effective range
of about 15 meters.

324
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:50,760
That's pretty close.

325
00:19:50,807 --> 00:19:52,436
Well, it's enough
to take care of the guard.

326
00:19:52,477 --> 00:19:54,607
Once he's down,
I'll get his weapon.

327
00:19:54,649 --> 00:19:56,414
We run like hell
for the runabout.

328
00:19:56,453 --> 00:19:58,720
Good work, Chief.

329
00:19:58,759 --> 00:19:59,727
Keep this up.

330
00:19:59,761 --> 00:20:01,823
You may make a fine officer
someday.

331
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:03,803
Oh. Thank you, Lieutenant.

332
00:20:03,838 --> 00:20:06,777
Coming from you,
that means a lot to me.

333
00:20:06,811 --> 00:20:08,110
I know.

334
00:20:08,148 --> 00:20:09,447
Carry on.

335
00:20:12,993 --> 00:20:15,260
What have you found?

336
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:18,898
Well, uh, so far,
nothing I've tested

337
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,466
matches the molecular structure

338
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,606
of the, uh, enzyme receptors
in your body

339
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:24,620
but I did find
something promising

340
00:20:24,654 --> 00:20:26,557
in one
of the native plants here.

341
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:27,788
Take a look at this.

342
00:20:27,829 --> 00:20:31,167
Uh, as you can see, there is

343
00:20:31,203 --> 00:20:33,640
a high concentration
of chlorophyll in these plants

344
00:20:33,676 --> 00:20:36,478
which you wouldn't expect from
a planet orbiting a red giant.

345
00:20:36,516 --> 00:20:38,510
When will you have the cure?

346
00:20:38,554 --> 00:20:42,792
I'm not really sure... yet.

347
00:20:42,831 --> 00:20:46,465
Three days left, Doctor.

348
00:20:46,507 --> 00:20:47,635
What is this?

349
00:20:47,676 --> 00:20:50,478
That is something
I put together

350
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:53,580
to enhance the resolution
on that scanner.

351
00:21:06,955 --> 00:21:07,945
Ow!

352
00:21:07,992 --> 00:21:09,860
Stay where you are.

353
00:21:12,034 --> 00:21:14,164
Release him.

354
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:16,370
I said release him.

355
00:21:24,931 --> 00:21:26,195
Let him go.

356
00:21:26,235 --> 00:21:28,206
You know the penalty
for disobedience.

357
00:21:33,653 --> 00:21:37,287
You have a bruised trachea,
but there's no permanent damage.

358
00:21:37,328 --> 00:21:39,492
Return him to the holding cell.

359
00:21:47,954 --> 00:21:49,754
He cannot stand.

360
00:21:51,428 --> 00:21:53,524
Heal his wound.

361
00:21:58,178 --> 00:21:59,943
Well, it missed
the femoral artery

362
00:21:59,982 --> 00:22:02,112
but the knee joint's
been destroyed.

363
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,783
I can give you
something for the pain

364
00:22:03,825 --> 00:22:06,160
but I'll need a surgical
unit to replace this joint.

365
00:22:06,197 --> 00:22:07,689
He'll have to stay
off this leg

366
00:22:07,734 --> 00:22:09,796
until you can get him
to a medical facility.

367
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:13,507
If I cannot stand,
I am useless.

368
00:22:13,548 --> 00:22:15,576
You are not going to kill him.

369
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:19,288
This has nothing to do
with you, human.

370
00:22:19,328 --> 00:22:20,888
When I am dead

371
00:22:20,933 --> 00:22:23,997
there will be more white
for the rest of the men.

372
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,134
No.

373
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,239
Take him back to the ship.

374
00:22:27,282 --> 00:22:29,047
You know the rule.

375
00:22:29,085 --> 00:22:33,050
If the death of one will
make the rest stronger

376
00:22:33,095 --> 00:22:34,792
then he dies.

377
00:22:34,832 --> 00:22:36,769
We came here to be
free of the Vorta.

378
00:22:36,804 --> 00:22:40,336
It is time to stop
living by their rules.

379
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,585
Get back to work.

380
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,859
Come in.

381
00:24:10,918 --> 00:24:12,217
Do you have it?

382
00:24:12,254 --> 00:24:13,484
Of course.

383
00:24:28,862 --> 00:24:31,960
You are supposed to be
watching the Ferengi.

384
00:24:32,036 --> 00:24:36,172
I don't need you to tell me
what I'm supposed to be doing.

385
00:24:36,212 --> 00:24:38,479
I saw him inspecting
the crystals.

386
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,386
You had an opportunity
to arrest him.

387
00:24:40,423 --> 00:24:43,829
I perform my duties
as I see fit.

388
00:24:43,864 --> 00:24:47,100
You do not seem to be
performing them at all.

389
00:24:47,138 --> 00:24:50,510
Frankly, Commander, I'm not
interested in your opinion

390
00:24:50,547 --> 00:24:51,982
of my job performance.

391
00:24:52,017 --> 00:24:53,988
Now I suggest you attend
to your own duties

392
00:24:54,022 --> 00:24:56,118
and stop interfering in mine.

393
00:25:06,853 --> 00:25:07,821
Remarkable.

394
00:25:07,855 --> 00:25:10,794
Your body is producing
the exact amount

395
00:25:10,828 --> 00:25:13,699
of ketracel-white
you need to survive.

396
00:25:13,735 --> 00:25:16,002
But I can't find
where it's coming from.

397
00:25:16,075 --> 00:25:17,544
There don't appear to be

398
00:25:17,578 --> 00:25:20,551
any glands or cell clusters
producing the enzyme.

399
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:24,550
Mind you, your entire
metabolism defies belief.

400
00:25:24,594 --> 00:25:28,559
The growth rate of the Jem'Hadar
children is extraordinary.

401
00:25:28,604 --> 00:25:30,905
You have seen our children?

402
00:25:30,943 --> 00:25:32,971
We found a newborn
in the station once.

403
00:25:33,015 --> 00:25:35,486
He was fully grown
in three days.

404
00:25:35,521 --> 00:25:38,050
I would like to have seen
a group of humans

405
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,792
try to control
a Jem'Hadar child.

406
00:25:40,834 --> 00:25:41,802
Well, we couldn't.

407
00:25:41,837 --> 00:25:43,774
All he wanted to do
was fight and kill.

408
00:25:43,807 --> 00:25:44,775
If it wasn't for Odo

409
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,906
I don't know
what we would have done.

410
00:25:46,949 --> 00:25:49,284
Odo...

411
00:25:49,321 --> 00:25:51,987
is the Founder
on your space station.

412
00:25:52,027 --> 00:25:53,621
That's right.

413
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:57,571
I have never seen a Founder.

414
00:25:57,608 --> 00:26:00,240
Never?

415
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,686
To us, they are almost a myth.

416
00:26:03,722 --> 00:26:06,627
But everyone in the Dominion

417
00:26:06,662 --> 00:26:11,037
even the Vorta,
serve the Founders.

418
00:26:13,211 --> 00:26:17,415
I have fought against races
that believe in mythical beings

419
00:26:17,454 --> 00:26:21,225
who guide their destinies
and await them after death.

420
00:26:21,264 --> 00:26:25,434
They call them gods.

421
00:26:27,913 --> 00:26:32,117
The Founders are like gods
to the Jem'Hadar.

422
00:26:34,629 --> 00:26:36,623
But...

423
00:26:36,667 --> 00:26:39,731
our gods never talk to us

424
00:26:39,775 --> 00:26:43,546
and they don't wait for us
after death.

425
00:26:45,589 --> 00:26:48,494
They only want us
to fight for them

426
00:26:48,529 --> 00:26:51,000
and to die for them.

427
00:26:54,543 --> 00:26:57,072
He's beginning to question
everything he's been taught...

428
00:26:57,117 --> 00:27:00,523
blind obedience to the Founders,
killing without remorse

429
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:03,292
and the devaluation
of other sentient life-forms.

430
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:05,131
He's developing
his own moral structure.

431
00:27:05,202 --> 00:27:06,330
It's incredible!

432
00:27:06,372 --> 00:27:09,345
Or maybe that's
what he wants you to believe.

433
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:11,144
Think about it, Julian.

434
00:27:11,183 --> 00:27:13,017
What did he say to you?

435
00:27:13,055 --> 00:27:15,424
"Federation doctors are trained

436
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,931
to feel compassion
and sympathy."

437
00:27:17,966 --> 00:27:18,991
He's manipulating you!

438
00:27:19,035 --> 00:27:22,840
He wants you to work hard
and stop trying to escape.

439
00:27:22,878 --> 00:27:25,942
What about saving the life
of the wounded Jem'Hadar?

440
00:27:25,985 --> 00:27:27,716
I saw the look on their faces.

441
00:27:27,757 --> 00:27:29,751
They were shocked
at his behavior.

442
00:27:29,794 --> 00:27:31,195
I'm telling you, he's changing.

443
00:27:31,299 --> 00:27:33,064
All right,
let's say you're right

444
00:27:33,103 --> 00:27:34,903
and he's turning
into a nice guy.

445
00:27:34,941 --> 00:27:36,035
What are you getting at?

446
00:27:36,076 --> 00:27:38,104
I think we should
cooperate with him...

447
00:27:38,148 --> 00:27:40,585
help him in what he's doing.

448
00:27:41,656 --> 00:27:43,490
What?!

449
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:46,365
What makes Goran'Agar
different from the others?

450
00:27:46,401 --> 00:27:48,235
He's not addicted to the drug.

451
00:27:48,272 --> 00:27:51,177
Now, if we can get the other
Jem'Hadar soldiers off the drug

452
00:27:51,212 --> 00:27:53,080
they may go through
a similar change.

453
00:27:53,117 --> 00:27:55,452
And with the Jem'Hadar soldiers
thinking for themselves

454
00:27:55,489 --> 00:27:57,118
the Founders may
suddenly find themselves

455
00:27:57,161 --> 00:27:58,562
without an army
to give orders to.

456
00:27:58,597 --> 00:28:00,157
You're just guessing.

457
00:28:00,201 --> 00:28:02,069
You don't know
how the other Jem'Hadar

458
00:28:02,106 --> 00:28:04,009
will react when they're
off the drugs.

459
00:28:04,043 --> 00:28:06,607
They may go marauding
through the galaxy on their own.

460
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:09,555
At least now, the Dominion
keeps them on a short leash.

461
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,720
They're not animals!

462
00:28:11,762 --> 00:28:14,998
They're people
being used as slaves.

463
00:28:16,239 --> 00:28:18,403
And this is their one chance
at freedom.

464
00:28:18,444 --> 00:28:20,244
And what are they going
to do with that freedom?

465
00:28:20,349 --> 00:28:21,943
Stop being so naive, Julian

466
00:28:21,986 --> 00:28:24,048
and look at them
for what they are.

467
00:28:24,091 --> 00:28:25,253
They're killers.

468
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:26,422
That's all they know how to do

469
00:28:26,464 --> 00:28:27,489
that's all they want to do.

470
00:28:27,533 --> 00:28:30,131
But they have the potential
to be so much more.

471
00:28:30,173 --> 00:28:31,802
Goran'Agar has shown them that.

472
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:33,244
They just need our help.

473
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,649
Well, then they should
have asked for our help

474
00:28:35,686 --> 00:28:38,716
instead of shooting us down
and threatening to kill us.

475
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,127
But they didn't know
why we were coming.

476
00:28:40,163 --> 00:28:41,826
They probably thought
we were trying to attack.

477
00:28:41,867 --> 00:28:43,838
I can't believe
you're making excuses for them.

478
00:28:43,872 --> 00:28:45,740
I'm trying
to make you understand

479
00:28:45,777 --> 00:28:47,474
there are larger issues here.

480
00:28:47,514 --> 00:28:49,781
We're dealing
with a complex situation.

481
00:28:49,819 --> 00:28:50,787
No, it is not complex.

482
00:28:50,822 --> 00:28:51,790
It is simple.

483
00:28:51,824 --> 00:28:54,318
Those men out there
are Dominion soldiers.

484
00:28:54,431 --> 00:28:55,627
We help them, we may end up

485
00:28:55,668 --> 00:28:57,764
unleashing the Jem'Hadar
against the Federation

486
00:28:57,806 --> 00:28:58,865
and that is a risk

487
00:28:58,908 --> 00:29:00,343
I am not willing to take!

488
00:29:00,378 --> 00:29:01,472
So we do not help them.

489
00:29:01,515 --> 00:29:02,711
And that's the end of it.

490
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,946
No, that is not the end of it.

491
00:29:03,987 --> 00:29:05,115
I am the senior officer here

492
00:29:05,157 --> 00:29:06,991
and I have decided
what we're going to do.

493
00:29:07,027 --> 00:29:08,587
Now, I need the biospectral
phase discriminator

494
00:29:08,632 --> 00:29:09,726
from the runabout's
sensor array.

495
00:29:09,767 --> 00:29:11,897
I haven't got the technical
skills to remove it

496
00:29:11,939 --> 00:29:13,306
so I'm ordering you to do it.

497
00:29:13,343 --> 00:29:14,471
Now, is that clear?

498
00:29:16,016 --> 00:29:17,246
Yes, sir.

499
00:29:27,543 --> 00:29:29,878
How long will this take?

500
00:29:29,915 --> 00:29:31,909
A few minutes.

501
00:29:38,637 --> 00:29:41,235
Your escape plan was flawed.

502
00:29:41,276 --> 00:29:43,840
Obviously.
I got caught.

503
00:29:43,883 --> 00:29:45,546
Even if you had killed the guard

504
00:29:45,586 --> 00:29:47,784
you never would have reached
the runabout.

505
00:29:48,961 --> 00:29:51,364
I guess we'll never know that.

506
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,337
I know.

507
00:29:55,277 --> 00:29:57,748
I'm sure you do.

508
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,426
You're not like the other human.

509
00:30:04,499 --> 00:30:07,370
We have our differences.

510
00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:09,536
You don't like helping us.

511
00:30:13,621 --> 00:30:15,147
No, I don't.

512
00:30:15,191 --> 00:30:16,285
Good.

513
00:30:16,327 --> 00:30:17,819
I don't like it, either.

514
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,535
Well, I'm glad
we understand each other.

515
00:30:26,417 --> 00:30:27,909
Slowly.

516
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:32,192
Now, put it down.

517
00:31:05,767 --> 00:31:08,399
Nothing.

518
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,778
I can find nothing
in the atmosphere, the soil

519
00:31:11,815 --> 00:31:14,048
the water, the plant
or the animal life

520
00:31:14,087 --> 00:31:16,924
that is remotely compatible
to your cellular structure

521
00:31:16,961 --> 00:31:17,986
or your DNA.

522
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:18,998
Maybe you were exposed

523
00:31:19,032 --> 00:31:21,503
to some anomalous
conditions four years ago

524
00:31:21,538 --> 00:31:23,907
that no longer exist...
a magnetic storm

525
00:31:23,944 --> 00:31:25,938
solar radiation, volcanic gases.

526
00:31:25,983 --> 00:31:27,282
No.

527
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:30,919
Everything is as it was
four years ago.

528
00:31:30,961 --> 00:31:34,128
The planet is the same.

529
00:31:34,169 --> 00:31:36,037
The conditions are the same!

530
00:31:36,073 --> 00:31:39,069
The answer must be here.

531
00:31:39,114 --> 00:31:43,580
There is no other explanation
for what happened to me.

532
00:31:43,624 --> 00:31:47,691
Maybe there is an explanation.

533
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:52,940
Maybe nothing happened
to you on this planet.

534
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:57,446
Maybe you were never addicted
to this drug at all.

535
00:31:57,491 --> 00:31:59,085
But I took white all my life.

536
00:31:59,128 --> 00:32:01,156
But maybe you didn't need it.

537
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,866
It's possible
that your DNA structure

538
00:32:03,907 --> 00:32:05,604
underwent
a random mutation that...

539
00:32:06,512 --> 00:32:08,141
He's escaped.

540
00:32:08,184 --> 00:32:09,813
How?

541
00:32:09,854 --> 00:32:12,383
Using their ship's transporter.

542
00:32:12,427 --> 00:32:14,056
They planned this together.

543
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:17,561
Do you know where O'Brien is?

544
00:32:17,606 --> 00:32:19,509
No.

545
00:32:19,544 --> 00:32:21,947
Deploy the men in a standard...

546
00:32:21,983 --> 00:32:22,973
He's lying.

547
00:32:23,019 --> 00:32:24,750
He's been lying for days.

548
00:32:24,823 --> 00:32:26,190
There is no cure here.

549
00:32:26,227 --> 00:32:28,596
Even if there was,
he wouldn't give it to you.

550
00:32:28,632 --> 00:32:30,158
There is a cure.

551
00:32:30,202 --> 00:32:32,469
I am the proof.

552
00:32:32,509 --> 00:32:37,887
Now, deploy the men
in a standard search pattern.

553
00:32:37,921 --> 00:32:41,920
Find O'Brien and return him
to the holding area alive.

554
00:32:41,965 --> 00:32:43,799
Alive?

555
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:46,205
Are you questioning me?

556
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:52,623
I knew you once, trusted you,
obeyed you without question

557
00:32:52,657 --> 00:32:56,827
but now you're like this human...

558
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,392
weak

559
00:32:58,437 --> 00:33:00,635
soft, inferior.

560
00:33:00,676 --> 00:33:04,583
If being free of white
means becoming like you...

561
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:06,954
I don't want to be cured.

562
00:33:14,442 --> 00:33:16,436
What'll happen to O'Brien?

563
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,815
There is nothing
we can do for him.

564
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,018
My men will no longer obey me.

565
00:33:22,061 --> 00:33:23,826
You have to find him first

566
00:33:23,864 --> 00:33:26,837
and keep him alive
until I can find a cure.

567
00:33:26,906 --> 00:33:30,244
If I go

568
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:33,344
there will be no one here
to guard you.

569
00:33:33,388 --> 00:33:35,552
I will not try to escape.

570
00:33:35,593 --> 00:33:37,393
I give you my word.

571
00:33:38,733 --> 00:33:40,897
I will do what I can.

572
00:33:56,276 --> 00:33:59,147
I've been saving this
for a special occasion.

573
00:33:59,183 --> 00:34:02,020
Tonight certainly qualifies.

574
00:34:08,438 --> 00:34:11,343
How'd you manage to get these
out of the Tallonian system?

575
00:34:11,379 --> 00:34:14,820
I have my resources.

576
00:34:22,171 --> 00:34:23,902
A hundred percent pure.

577
00:34:24,009 --> 00:34:27,210
Well worth twice
the price I'm asking.

578
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:29,153
I don't know if I'd go that far.

579
00:34:30,592 --> 00:34:32,927
Trafficking
in illegal merchandise

580
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,933
is a felony
under Federation law.

581
00:34:35,002 --> 00:34:37,303
What's he doing here?

582
00:34:47,164 --> 00:34:49,260
A very good question.

583
00:34:49,303 --> 00:34:52,105
I was just about to arrest
these criminals.

584
00:34:52,143 --> 00:34:53,510
I should arrest you

585
00:34:53,546 --> 00:34:55,517
for interfering
in my investigation.

586
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:58,683
Will someone tell me
what is going on here?

587
00:34:58,725 --> 00:35:00,593
Odo, why did you not tell me
what you were doing?

588
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,601
I don't report to you, Commander

589
00:35:02,635 --> 00:35:04,036
and I don't spread the word

590
00:35:04,072 --> 00:35:06,772
when I'm conducting
an undercover investigation.

591
00:35:06,811 --> 00:35:08,941
I also thought
that your surveillance

592
00:35:09,016 --> 00:35:11,249
would make the setup
more convincing.

593
00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:13,192
I'm not interested in this man.

594
00:35:13,226 --> 00:35:16,290
He was supposed to complete
the transaction

595
00:35:16,335 --> 00:35:19,308
and take the latinum
back to his ship

596
00:35:19,342 --> 00:35:21,404
so that I could infiltrate

597
00:35:21,447 --> 00:35:24,318
the entire Markalian
smuggling operation.

598
00:35:24,354 --> 00:35:28,626
Now I suppose I'll have
to settle for the middleman.

599
00:35:28,664 --> 00:35:31,432
If you gentlemen are finished
with this little fiasco

600
00:35:31,471 --> 00:35:32,963
I'd like to tidy up.

601
00:35:33,007 --> 00:35:34,101
Quark!

602
00:35:41,795 --> 00:35:43,959
On your feet.
Let's go.

603
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,668
I've lost the signal.

604
00:36:16,712 --> 00:36:18,079
Spread out.

605
00:36:55,071 --> 00:36:56,039
Chief!

606
00:36:56,073 --> 00:36:57,041
Where's the guard?

607
00:36:57,076 --> 00:36:58,773
Everyone's out looking for you.

608
00:36:58,813 --> 00:37:00,647
Good.

609
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:03,453
Anything else around here
we can use as a weapon?

610
00:37:06,332 --> 00:37:08,326
No?

611
00:37:08,369 --> 00:37:09,702
Let's get moving.

612
00:37:09,739 --> 00:37:11,937
It's only 300 meters
to the runabout

613
00:37:11,978 --> 00:37:13,538
but those guys move fast.

614
00:37:13,582 --> 00:37:16,282
Chief, I'm not going.

615
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:27,541
What the hell do you mean,
you're not coming?

616
00:37:27,582 --> 00:37:28,744
I'm onto something here.

617
00:37:28,785 --> 00:37:30,448
With a little more time,
I think...

618
00:37:30,489 --> 00:37:32,015
I don't care what you think.

619
00:37:32,059 --> 00:37:33,494
This is our one chance
to get out of here

620
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:34,726
and we've got to take it.

621
00:37:34,766 --> 00:37:36,999
And it's also our one chance
to break their addiction.

622
00:37:37,038 --> 00:37:40,034
Julian, even if you find a cure

623
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,343
they're going
to kill you anyway.

624
00:37:41,382 --> 00:37:43,285
That's not true.
Goran'Agar...

625
00:37:43,319 --> 00:37:44,287
Forget about him.

626
00:37:44,322 --> 00:37:45,290
What about all the others?

627
00:37:45,324 --> 00:37:46,725
They're still
a bunch of bloodthirsty...

628
00:37:46,761 --> 00:37:50,133
Look, we haven't got enough
time to argue about this.

629
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,639
If you want to go, go.

630
00:37:53,377 --> 00:37:54,641
All right.

631
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,309
I will.

632
00:37:59,492 --> 00:38:01,360
But you're coming with me.

633
00:38:09,349 --> 00:38:10,978
There.

634
00:38:11,019 --> 00:38:13,081
You can bring me up on
charges when we get back

635
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:15,619
but there's nothing
to keep you here now.

636
00:38:15,663 --> 00:38:17,394
So let's get going.

637
00:38:26,924 --> 00:38:29,453
You did this?

638
00:38:29,497 --> 00:38:30,796
Yes.

639
00:38:30,834 --> 00:38:32,771
I did.

640
00:38:33,874 --> 00:38:36,711
Move... both of you.

641
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:37,773
This won't...

642
00:38:37,817 --> 00:38:38,911
No discussion!

643
00:38:38,953 --> 00:38:40,354
Move!

644
00:38:46,905 --> 00:38:48,272
There still might be a way

645
00:38:48,309 --> 00:38:49,903
if I had another sample
of your blood.

646
00:38:49,946 --> 00:38:51,506
There is no more time.

647
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:53,612
The supply of white
will run out tomorrow.

648
00:39:09,196 --> 00:39:10,460
You caught him.

649
00:39:10,499 --> 00:39:12,697
I shouldn't have doubted you.

650
00:39:12,738 --> 00:39:17,444
Should we kill them ourselves
or let the others?

651
00:39:17,483 --> 00:39:18,975
I will do the killing.

652
00:39:37,999 --> 00:39:41,235
Take your ship and go.

653
00:39:41,273 --> 00:39:46,081
Goran'Agar, if you stay here,
they'll kill you.

654
00:39:46,118 --> 00:39:48,647
Unless I kill them first.

655
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:50,718
It would be better
for them to die

656
00:39:50,762 --> 00:39:53,860
quickly in battle, than slowly
as the drug runs out.

657
00:39:53,904 --> 00:39:55,464
You don't have to do this.

658
00:39:55,507 --> 00:39:57,101
Even if we can't
save their lives

659
00:39:57,211 --> 00:39:59,273
there's no need
to sacrifice yourself.

660
00:40:01,421 --> 00:40:04,053
You are a soldier?

661
00:40:04,094 --> 00:40:05,894
I have been.

662
00:40:07,469 --> 00:40:08,938
Then you explain.

663
00:40:20,534 --> 00:40:22,265
He's their Commander.

664
00:40:22,304 --> 00:40:24,639
They trusted him.

665
00:40:24,677 --> 00:40:26,648
He can't leave them.

666
00:40:39,078 --> 00:40:40,741
Julian.

667
00:41:00,863 --> 00:41:01,888
Come in.

668
00:41:05,909 --> 00:41:08,210
Captain, there's
some information

669
00:41:08,315 --> 00:41:09,477
I would like to add

670
00:41:09,517 --> 00:41:11,784
to Security Chief Odo's
last report.

671
00:41:18,272 --> 00:41:20,140
He did not feel
it was necessary

672
00:41:20,176 --> 00:41:22,944
to include the details
of my involvement, but...

673
00:41:22,983 --> 00:41:27,050
I think you should know that I
hindered his investigation.

674
00:41:27,093 --> 00:41:28,893
Yes, I heard what happened.

675
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:33,235
Please, sit.

676
00:41:38,254 --> 00:41:41,524
Word gets around
in a place like this.

677
00:41:41,561 --> 00:41:44,728
It's one of the things
you have to get used to.

678
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:47,765
One of many things, it seems.

679
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:50,612
Starfleet officers
often have trouble

680
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:54,056
learning the unofficial rules
of the station.

681
00:41:54,091 --> 00:41:56,153
There's no manual to study.

682
00:41:56,197 --> 00:41:58,361
You have to learn things
as you go.

683
00:41:59,437 --> 00:42:03,846
A little different
than life on a starship.

684
00:42:03,881 --> 00:42:06,877
When I served
aboard the <i>Enterprise</i>

685
00:42:06,922 --> 00:42:08,050
I always knew

686
00:42:08,091 --> 00:42:11,463
who were my allies
and who were my enemies.

687
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:17,408
Let's just say DS9
has more shades of gray

688
00:42:17,447 --> 00:42:22,551
and Quark definitely is
a shade of... gray.

689
00:42:22,593 --> 00:42:25,532
He has his own set of rules

690
00:42:25,567 --> 00:42:27,059
and he follows them diligently.

691
00:42:27,104 --> 00:42:29,473
Once you understand them,
you understand Quark.

692
00:42:29,509 --> 00:42:32,813
I'd say that's true
for... everyone here.

693
00:42:39,801 --> 00:42:42,068
You'll fit in, Commander.

694
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:48,084
Just give it time.

695
00:42:56,808 --> 00:42:59,302
Kira to <i>Rubicon.</i>

696
00:42:59,348 --> 00:43:01,148
Docking Platform 2 is open.

697
00:43:01,186 --> 00:43:02,621
Welcome back, gentleman.

698
00:43:02,656 --> 00:43:03,715
Thanks, Major.

699
00:43:10,073 --> 00:43:12,476
You can bring me up
on charges, you know.

700
00:43:12,512 --> 00:43:15,748
Well, that's not
really my style.

701
00:43:18,092 --> 00:43:21,065
I wish things could have
been different, Julian.

702
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:23,366
So do I.

703
00:43:25,176 --> 00:43:29,414
And I'm sorry I had
to destroy your work.

704
00:43:29,453 --> 00:43:32,085
You didn't have to, Chief.

705
00:43:32,126 --> 00:43:33,595
You had a choice

706
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:36,831
and you chose to disobey orders

707
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:39,741
override my judgment

708
00:43:39,778 --> 00:43:43,082
and condemn those men to death.

709
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:44,919
Yes, I did...

710
00:43:44,957 --> 00:43:47,657
because I thought it was
the only way to save your life.

711
00:43:47,697 --> 00:43:51,365
Whatever else you may think
of who I am and what I did

712
00:43:51,406 --> 00:43:53,604
at least try to understand that.

713
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,258
Tonight's supposed to be
our weekly darts game.

714
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,601
Don't worry.

715
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,577
I don't feel
much like playing either.

716
00:44:11,387 --> 00:44:14,189
Maybe in a few days.
