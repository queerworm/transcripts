1
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:26,151
That is the worst mug
shot I have ever seen.

2
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,445
I have never understood
why law enforcement agencies

3
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,322
don't keep better
visual records.

4
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:32,741
You'd think they'd
be concerned
about little things

5
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:35,911
like making an accurate
identification.

6
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:37,621
The picture is
accurate enough

7
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:41,667
to establish that your customer
is Regana Tosh,

8
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,168
who is known
to be associated

9
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,128
with a Markalian
smuggling operation.

10
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:49,884
Really? Well, everyone
is welcome at Quark's.

11
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:51,593
I don't discriminate.

12
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:54,471
Just like Starfleet.

13
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,181
They have a
nondiscrimination
policy, too,

14
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,683
don't they, Commander?

15
00:00:57,683 --> 00:01:00,811
I guess we have
<i>something</i> in common.

16
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:01,979
KIRA:
You have more in common

17
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,439
with a Rakonian swamp rat,
Quark.

18
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:08,235
Major. Always a delight
to see you here.

19
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:09,653
What can I get
for you?

20
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:10,821
Tarkalean tea.

21
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,910
But not, not too sweet
this time.

22
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:22,583
Catching up on some work?

23
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,001
Not exactly.

24
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,634
That man arrived
on the station

25
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,345
this afternoon and
came directly here.

26
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,681
I believe
the Ferengi bartender

27
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:39,600
is plotting something
with him.

28
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,643
I wouldn't be surprised.

29
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,395
Quark's always
up to something.

30
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:45,647
If he is
a known criminal,

31
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:46,857
why does your
Security Chief

32
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,525
not do anything
about him?

33
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,985
Odo keeps him in check.

34
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:52,947
Yes.

35
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:55,156
But not in prison.

36
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:59,745
BASHIR:<i> Medical Officer's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 49066.5.</i>

37
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:02,581
<i>Chief O'Brien and I have</i>
<i>concluded our bio-survey</i>

38
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:05,166
<i>of Merik III</i>
<i>in the Gamma Quadrant.</i>

39
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,794
<i>We are on course</i>
<i>back to the wormhole</i>

40
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:08,462
<i>and should arrive</i>
<i>at the station</i>

41
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:09,838
<i>two days ahead of schedule.</i>

42
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,840
Keiko only spends
a few days at a time

43
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,133
on the station.

44
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,011
I'm the one living
in those quarters.

45
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,262
And if I want to set up

46
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,431
a little workshop
in the bedroom...

47
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:22,517
You set up a workshop
in the bedroom?

48
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,019
Yeah.

49
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:25,813
Well, I don't use it
when she's visiting.

50
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,022
Oh, of course not.

51
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:28,315
She says I'm
trying to live

52
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,942
"like a bachelor again,"

53
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:33,320
that I'm expressing
a "subconscious desire"

54
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,864
to push her out
of our quarters.

55
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,658
Now that<i> is</i> ridiculous.

56
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,076
That's what I said.

57
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:40,035
I mean,

58
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:41,369
if anything,

59
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,538
by spending your free time
in the bedroom--

60
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,833
a place you intimately associate
with Keiko--

61
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,376
you are actually
expressing

62
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:53,214
a desire to be closer to her
during her absence.

63
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,342
It's quite touching, really.

64
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,845
Exactly. Exactly!

65
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:00,305
See, you understand.

66
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,974
Why can't she see that?

67
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:04,183
Why can't she be more like...

68
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:07,729
More like...?

69
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:13,192
Well, a man.

70
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,987
More like a man.

71
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:18,824
So...

72
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:21,242
you wish...

73
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,162
Keiko was a man.

74
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,374
I wish I was on this trip

75
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,375
with someone else.

76
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,459
That's what I wish.

77
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,585
(<i> laughs</i> )

78
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,462
(<i> console beeping</i> )

79
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,213
We're picking up
a subspace

80
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:35,716
magneton pulse.

81
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,426
Bearing 090, mark 115.

82
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,679
The Bopak system.

83
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,681
What's a magneton pulse?

84
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:43,932
It's a burst
of polarized

85
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,350
magnetic energy.

86
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,977
It's usually produced
by a damaged warp core.

87
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,812
So there could be
a ship in trouble?

88
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:49,771
Possibly.

89
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,815
Let's take a look.

90
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:59,156
I'm having trouble pinpointing
the source of the plasma surge.

91
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:01,282
Too much EM interference
in the atmosphere,

92
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,952
but it's definitely
down there somewhere.

93
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,914
According to our records,
Bopak III is uninhabited.

94
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,166
The nearest Dominion outpost
is six weeks away,

95
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,626
and this system is well off
the established trade routes

96
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,627
in the Gamma Quadrant.

97
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,254
Strange place
for a ship

98
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,381
to set down, even if it was
having engine trouble.

99
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:19,093
Of course, it could be
an anomalous reading,

100
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:20,135
but I'd feel
a lot better

101
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:21,261
if we could...

102
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,721
Hold on.

103
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,057
There's some kind
of energy surge on...

104
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:26,183
(<i> reverberating thud</i> )

105
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,227
Wha-What the hell...?

106
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:29,728
We've been hit
by a plasma field.

107
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,063
We're losing main power.

108
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:32,898
Switching to auxiliary units.

109
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:35,316
The field's draining our power.

110
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,401
I can't break free.

111
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,903
We're losing altitude.

112
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,446
Send out a distress call.

113
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:40,864
I'll try and get us

114
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,574
down in one piece.

115
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,659
And the com system jammed!

116
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,787
I'm reading a
clearing up ahead.

117
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:47,871
I think we can make it.

118
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:48,956
Hold on.

119
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:07,182
(<i> crash</i> )

120
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:12,062
(<i> sighs</i> )

121
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,787
What a lovely place.

122
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,796
Smells like a garbage dump.

123
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:40,757
I'm sorry I couldn't find a
nicer place to crash-land.

124
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,676
Well, should
we try again?

125
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,303
(<i> whoosh of active transport)</i>

126
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:49,683
Do not move.

127
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,351
You are prisoners
of the Jem'Hadar.

128
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,731
Are there other Starfleet
ships with you?

129
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:07,528
Tell me.

130
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:08,822
There are no other
ships with us,

131
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,031
but if we don't return,

132
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,741
Starfleet will begin
looking for us.

133
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:12,909
When?

134
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:13,994
BASHIR:
Soon.

135
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,912
You're lying.

136
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,458
No other crew.

137
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,708
Standard Danube-class
runabout.

138
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,127
Some modification

139
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:24,045
to the phaser array
and shield generators.

140
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,797
Why were you in
this star system?

141
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,048
We picked up
a magneton pulse.

142
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,549
We thought there
might be a ship

143
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,634
in trouble, so we
altered our course...

144
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,011
Return to the ship.

145
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,180
Put a damping field
on our warp engine.

146
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,352
Human.

147
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,561
Gold uniform indicates
a specialty

148
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,356
in security or engineering.

149
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:44,983
Rank: Chief
Petty Officer.

150
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,861
You are what Starfleet
refers to as a "noncom."

151
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,821
That's right.

152
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,407
You must have a great deal
of experience.

153
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,075
I've been around.

154
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,869
That makes you
a priority target.

155
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:56,911
We will kill you first.

156
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,376
Human, rank of Lieutenant

157
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:05,045
with a specialty
in the sciences.

158
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,422
Doctor, actually.

159
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,590
Science
and medical officers

160
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,592
are low-priority
targets.

161
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,303
I submit
we execute this one

162
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:16,139
and use the other
in a tactical exercise.

163
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,059
No.

164
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,144
Bring them both back to camp.

165
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:25,982
Move.

166
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,530
WORF:
We cannot allow him
to continue

167
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,031
these criminal
activities.

168
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:35,658
I am fully aware
of Quark's activities,

169
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,827
and I'm conducting
a thorough investigation

170
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,620
of his connection
with the smuggler.

171
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,831
If you'll excuse me, Captain.

172
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,583
Of course.

173
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,840
I know Odo may do things

174
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,343
a little differently
than you're used to,

175
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:55,970
but he really is
very good at his job.

176
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,598
I'm not questioning
his competence.

177
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,351
How many years
were you in security,

178
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:02,602
Commander?

179
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,937
Seven.

180
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,189
Must be a hard habit to break.

181
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,149
I remain vigilant.

182
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:12,946
And I do encourage vigilance
in my officers.

183
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,864
But remember--

184
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:18,452
Odo is Chief of Security
on this station,

185
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:21,162
and you're the Strategic
Operations Officer.

186
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,872
Your primary duty

187
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,583
is to coordinate
all Starfleet activity

188
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:28,545
in this sector,
not to catch smugglers.

189
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,838
Understood.

190
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:33,508
I will not let this matter
interfere with my duties.

191
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,719
Very well.
Dismissed.

192
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,607
Does he look nervous
to you?

193
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:50,942
A bit distracted, yeah.

194
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,569
And at the runabout,

195
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,404
they seemed concerned
about being found here.

196
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,363
Something's going on.

197
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,615
I'd hate to think

198
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:58,617
what would make
the Jem'Hadar jumpy.

199
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:00,868
They need a doctor.

200
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,455
Someone's injured
or sick.

201
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,417
If that's true, Julian,
don't help them.

202
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,002
Anything that
weakens them

203
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,212
increases our chances
of getting out of here.

204
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,510
Come with me.

205
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,264
He stays.

206
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,627
You will work here.

207
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,047
Where are the patients?

208
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,049
There are no patients.

209
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,552
You are here to carry out
scientific research for us.

210
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:00,136
If you refuse,
I will have to kill you.

211
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,720
Do you understand?

212
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,474
And you need to understand
that I'm a Starfleet officer

213
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,184
and I won't do
any work for you

214
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,061
that might potentially be
used against the Federation

215
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,896
or any other race,
for that matter.

216
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:13,608
Now, if that's what you want,
you'll have to kill me.

217
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:18,071
Fortunately for you, weapons
research is not what I need.

218
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,490
There is a drug...

219
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:27,205
that all Jem'Hadar must have
in order to live.

220
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:30,958
We call it ketracel-white.

221
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,002
An isogenic enzyme.

222
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,590
You know about it?

223
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,884
I know that the Jem'Hadar
have been genetically engineered

224
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:43,054
by the Dominion to be addicted
to what you call ketracel-white.

225
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:45,098
And that by controlling
the supply of this drug,

226
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,392
the Founders
maintain control over you.

227
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:53,064
The Vorta, they are the ones
who control the drug.

228
00:12:56,984 --> 00:13:00,071
They are the ones
we came here to escape.

229
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,489
Escape?

230
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:04,743
You're trying
to leave the Dominion?

231
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:05,826
Yes.

232
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:09,623
You disapprove.

233
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:10,665
No. I...

234
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:14,544
I'm just... just surprised.

235
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,254
Surprised
because a Jem'Hadar soldier

236
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,716
might want something more
than the life of a slave?

237
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:24,763
You know<i> nothing</i>
about the Jem'Hadar,

238
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:28,767
except that you fear us.

239
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:31,436
But...

240
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:34,105
you will make
our final escape

241
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:37,942
from the Dominion possible.

242
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:42,155
We have only enough white
to last another five days.

243
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:48,202
And you want me to try
and synthesize this drug?

244
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:52,749
No. We do not want
more of the drug.

245
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:55,418
We want to be free of it--

246
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,462
to break the addiction.

247
00:13:57,462 --> 00:14:00,715
I'm not sure
that that's possible.

248
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,759
It is possible.

249
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:07,597
I know, because I am
free of the drug.

250
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:12,977
No supply tube.

251
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,729
I don't understand.

252
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,690
Your entire genetic structure

253
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,066
was designed to collapse
without the ketracel.

254
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:22,069
Why did you stop
taking the drug?

255
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,157
It was not by choice.

256
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,663
Three years ago,

257
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:34,874
I was on a ship
that crashed on this world.

258
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,544
The rest of the crew died,
and I was left

259
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:40,880
with only enough white
to sustain me for three days.

260
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,300
I rationed my
supply and managed

261
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,011
to stretch the drug out
for eight days,

262
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:50,139
and then it was gone,

263
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:55,770
and I was ready to die.

264
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,064
But death never came.

265
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:03,110
I lived here...

266
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,532
for 35 days without
a single drop of white.

267
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:13,329
Being here,
on this planet, cured me.

268
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,082
So that's why you
returned here--

269
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,877
to cure the rest
of your men as well.

270
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:20,503
But it hasn't worked, has it?

271
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:21,671
They still need the drug.

272
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:29,846
We have come
to the same place,

273
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:32,599
breathed the same air,

274
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,016
eaten the same food--

275
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,603
it should have
cured them as well.

276
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:40,607
That may be oversimplifying
the situation.

277
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,483
There may be
many factors--

278
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,068
I want you to see this.

279
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:57,874
Take the pain.

280
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:00,919
Show Goran'Agar
we're still Jem'Hadar.

281
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:14,849
(<i> groaning</i> )

282
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,436
You did not fall.

283
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,396
Feel pride in that.

284
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,948
As a Federation doctor,

285
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:32,241
I know you are trained
to feel sympathy

286
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,619
and compassion
for those in pain.

287
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:37,246
These men
are suffering now,

288
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:40,333
but it is nothing compared
to what will happen

289
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,669
if they are not freed
from the drug

290
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,463
before our supply runs out.

291
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:48,007
I can't promise anything.

292
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,843
Will you try?

293
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:53,304
I'll need Chief O'Brien's help.

294
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:56,223
Yes, I'll try.

295
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:58,476
Now give those men
what they need, please.

296
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,110
Second.

297
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:28,381
I've told them we have
enough white to last 27 days.

298
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,424
That is a lie.

299
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:33,093
There's only enough
to last five days.

300
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,471
You have
that long, Doctor.

301
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,223
After that,
they<i> will</i> die,

302
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:40,852
but not before they kill me
for betraying them

303
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:44,981
and you for not saving them.

304
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,822
The Klingons have
also attacked

305
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:55,282
three more outposts
along the Romulan border.

306
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,577
In short, they're
reasserting themselves

307
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,537
all over the Quadrant.

308
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:00,914
You'd think they'd be
a little less aggressive

309
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,206
after failing
to conquer Cardassia.

310
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,042
WORF:
If the invasion
was seen

311
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:06,794
as a failure, Gowron would have
been assassinated by now.

312
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,797
He simply declared victory
and returned home.

313
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:13,009
Now he's looking
for his next victory.

314
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,886
ODO:
Bajoran Intelligence

315
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:17,221
believes the Klingons
are searching for weaknesses

316
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,890
in the star systems
along their borders.

317
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,768
And when they find
an appropriately weak system,

318
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:22,810
they invade.

319
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,228
It's the same old story--

320
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,897
the strong survive,
and the weak perish.

321
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:29,525
We'll save that particular
debate for another time.

322
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,945
I want a complete briefing
every day

323
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:33,905
about the Klingon situation.

324
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:35,865
Dismissed.

325
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,369
May I speak
with you a moment?

326
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:43,915
I assume this
is about Quark.

327
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:46,751
He has made arrangements
to acquire a type IV

328
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,127
Tallonian
microscanner.

329
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,087
Has he?

330
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:50,546
The type IV
is primarily

331
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,382
used to determine the purity
of Tallonian crystals.

332
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,343
Which are illegal anywhere,

333
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,054
but on the Tallonian
homeworld.

334
00:18:58,054 --> 00:18:59,597
Interesting.

335
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:03,225
I appreciate you bringing me
this information, Commander.

336
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,518
I expect him to be meeting

337
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,312
with the smuggler again
this evening.

338
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,022
That would seem likely.

339
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:09,148
You will arrest him when...

340
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,608
Thank you, Mr. Worf.

341
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:14,112
Rest assured I'll take
care of this matter.

342
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:27,000
How long until that
scanner's ready, Chief?

343
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,336
Uh, about 30 minutes.

344
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:34,757
I'm having trouble
with the transtater interface.

345
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,843
Maybe you should
take a look, sir.

346
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,475
(<i> whispering</i> ):
The plasma charge will have

347
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:46,686
an effective range
of about 15 meters.

348
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,062
That's pretty close.

349
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:49,355
Well, it's enough
to take care of the guard.

350
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,816
Once he's down,
I'll get his weapon.

351
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,275
We run like hell
for the runabout.

352
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,569
(<i> normal voice</i> ):
Good work, Chief.

353
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,863
Keep this up.

354
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,823
You may make a fine
officer someday.

355
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:01,034
Oh. Thank you, Lieutenant.

356
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:03,744
Coming from you,
that means a lot to me.

357
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:04,912
I know.

358
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,330
Carry on.

359
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,003
What have you found?

360
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:15,840
Well, uh, so far,
nothing I've tested

361
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,299
matches
the molecular structure

362
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,468
of the, uh, enzyme receptors
in your body,

363
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,555
but I did find
something promising

364
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:23,597
in one of
the native plants here.

365
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:24,682
Take a look at this.

366
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:27,977
Uh, as you can see,
there is

367
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,354
a high concentration
of chlorophyll in these plants,

368
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:33,357
which you wouldn't expect from
a planet orbiting a red giant.

369
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,359
When will you have the cure?

370
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:39,739
I'm not really sure... yet.

371
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:43,367
Three days left, Doctor.

372
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,702
What is this?

373
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:47,371
O'BRIEN:
That is something
I put together

374
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,416
to enhance the resolution
on that scanner.

375
00:20:58,298 --> 00:20:59,967
(<i> yells</i> )

376
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:03,846
(<i> grunts</i> )

377
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:04,847
Ow!

378
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,807
Stay where you are.

379
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,937
Release him.

380
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:13,189
I said release him.

381
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,156
Let him go.

382
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:24,158
You know the penalty
for disobedience.

383
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:26,285
(<i> gagging, coughing</i> )

384
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,040
You have
a bruised trachea,

385
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,167
but there's no
permanent damage.

386
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:35,544
Return him
to the holding cell.

387
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:37,964
(<i> coughing</i> )

388
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,763
He cannot stand.

389
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:47,514
(<i> groaning</i> )

390
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:49,558
Heal his wound.

391
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:55,773
Well, it missed
the femoral artery,

392
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,900
but the knee joint's
been destroyed.

393
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,693
I can give you
something for the pain,

394
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,988
but I'll need a surgical
unit to replace this joint.

395
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:03,697
He'll have to stay
off this leg

396
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,908
until you can get him
to a medical facility.

397
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:09,453
If I cannot stand,
I am useless.

398
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,622
You are not going
to kill him.

399
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:15,251
This has nothing to do
with you, human.

400
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,003
When I am dead,

401
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:19,880
there will be more white
for the rest of the men.

402
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,090
No.

403
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,217
Take him back to the ship.

404
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:24,927
You know the rule.

405
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:28,931
If the death of one will
make the rest stronger,

406
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:30,641
then he dies.

407
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,601
GORAN'AGAR:
We came here to be
free of the Vorta.

408
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:36,314
It is time to stop
living by their rules.

409
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:40,609
Get back to work.

410
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:50,971
(<i> knocking at door</i> )

411
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,522
Come in.

412
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:08,822
QUARK:
Do you have it?

413
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:09,990
TOSH:
Of course.

414
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:28,550
You are supposed to be
watching the Ferengi.

415
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,428
I don't need you
to tell me

416
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:32,805
what I'm supposed
to be doing.

417
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,932
I saw him inspecting
the crystals.

418
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:36,725
You had an opportunity
to arrest him.

419
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:40,229
I perform my duties
as I see fit.

420
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:43,399
You do not seem to be
performing them at all.

421
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:46,902
Frankly, Commander, I'm not
interested in your opinion

422
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,528
of my job
performance.

423
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:50,364
Now I suggest you attend
to your own duties

424
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:52,574
and stop interfering in mine.

425
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,295
Remarkable.

426
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:07,340
Your body is producing
the exact amount

427
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,050
of ketracel-white
you need to survive.

428
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,345
But I can't find
where it's coming from.

429
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:13,929
There don't appear to be

430
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,932
any glands or cell clusters
producing the enzyme.

431
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:20,936
Mind you, your entire
metabolism defies belief.

432
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:25,065
The growth rate of the Jem'Hadar
children is extraordinary.

433
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:27,443
You have seen
our children?

434
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:29,445
We found a newborn
on the station once.

435
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:32,156
He was fully grown
in three days.

436
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:34,658
I would like to have seen
a group of humans

437
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,785
try to control
a Jem'Hadar child.

438
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,204
Well, we couldn't.

439
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:39,872
All he wanted to do
was fight and kill.

440
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,248
If it wasn't for Odo,

441
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:43,459
I don't know what
we would have done.

442
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:45,878
Odo...

443
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:48,506
is the Founder
on your space station.

444
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:50,049
That's right.

445
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:54,261
I have never seen
a Founder.

446
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,805
Never?

447
00:25:56,805 --> 00:26:00,184
To us, they are
almost a myth.

448
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:03,103
But everyone
in the Dominion,

449
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:07,649
even the Vorta,
serve the Founders.

450
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:13,989
I have fought against races
that believe in mythical beings

451
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:17,826
who guide their destinies
and await them after death.

452
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:22,122
They call them gods.

453
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:28,712
The Founders are like gods
to the Jem'Hadar.

454
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:33,050
But...

455
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:36,053
our gods never talk to us,

456
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:40,224
and they don't wait for us
after death.

457
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:45,104
They only want us
to fight for them

458
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:47,523
and to die for them.

459
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:53,571
BASHIR:
He's beginning to question
everything he's been taught--

460
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:55,197
blind obedience
to the Founders

461
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:57,032
killing without remorse

462
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,493
and the devaluation of
other sentient life-forms.

463
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:01,328
He's developing his
own moral structure.

464
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,829
It's incredible!

465
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:05,958
Or maybe that's what he
wants you to believe.

466
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,460
Think about it, Julian.

467
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,587
What did he say to you?

468
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:11,964
"Federation doctors are trained

469
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:14,091
to feel compassion
and sympathy."

470
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:15,175
He's manipulating you!

471
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,927
He wants you
to work hard

472
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:18,845
and stop trying
to escape.

473
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:22,099
What about saving the life
of the wounded Jem'Hadar?

474
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:23,809
I saw the look
on their faces.

475
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,769
They were<i> shocked</i>
at his behavior.

476
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,313
I'm telling you,
he's changing.

477
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:29,189
All right, let's
say you're right,

478
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,983
and he's turning
into a nice guy.

479
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,192
What are you getting at?

480
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:34,278
I think we should
cooperate with him--

481
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:36,905
help him in what he's doing.

482
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,699
What?!

483
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:42,578
What makes Goran'Agar
different from the others?

484
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:44,371
He's not addicted to the drug.

485
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:47,333
Now, if we can get the other
Jem'Hadar soldiers off the drug,

486
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,168
they may go through
a similar change.

487
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:51,669
And with the Jem'Hadar soldiers
thinking for themselves,

488
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:53,255
the Founders may
suddenly find themselves

489
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:54,672
without an army
to give orders to.

490
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:56,133
You're just guessing.

491
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:58,051
You don't know how
the other Jem'Hadar

492
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:00,095
will react when
they're off the drugs.

493
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,931
They may go marauding through
the galaxy on their own.

494
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,683
At least now, the Dominion
keeps them on a short leash.

495
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:07,769
They're not animals!

496
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:11,190
They're<i> people</i> being
used as slaves.

497
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,652
And this is their one
chance at freedom.

498
00:28:14,652 --> 00:28:16,487
And what are they going
to do with that freedom?

499
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:17,988
Stop being so naive,
Julian,

500
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:20,199
and look at them
for what they are.

501
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:21,367
They're killers.

502
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:22,535
That's all they
know how to do

503
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:24,036
that's all they want to do.

504
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:26,163
But they have the potential
to be so much more.

505
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:27,914
Goran'Agar
has shown them that.

506
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:29,542
They just need our help.

507
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:31,835
Well, then they should
have<i> asked</i> for our help,

508
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:34,630
instead of shooting us down
and threatening to kill us.

509
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,256
But they didn't know
why we were coming.

510
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,841
They probably thought
we were trying to attack.

511
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,843
I can't believe
you're making excuses for them.

512
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,095
I'm trying
to make you understand

513
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,639
there are larger issues here.

514
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:45,849
We're dealing
with a complex situation.

515
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:46,850
No, it is not complex.

516
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,227
It is simple.

517
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:50,312
Those men out there
are Dominion soldiers.

518
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:51,897
We help them, we may end up

519
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:53,815
unleashing the Jem'Hadar
against the Federation,

520
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:54,983
and that is a risk

521
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,527
I am not willing
to take!

522
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:57,570
So we do<i> not</i> help them.

523
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:58,737
And that's the end of it.

524
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,155
No, that is not the end of it.

525
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,532
I am the senior officer here,

526
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:03,033
and I have decided
what we're going to do.

527
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:04,910
Now, I need the biospectral
phase discriminator

528
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,495
from the runabout's
sensor array.

529
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:08,121
I haven't got the technical
skills to remove it,

530
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,415
so I'm ordering you to do it.

531
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:10,583
Now, is that clear?

532
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:13,377
Yes, sir.

533
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,847
How long will this take?

534
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,933
A few minutes.

535
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:37,150
Your escape plan
was flawed.

536
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,737
Obviously.
I got caught.

537
00:29:39,737 --> 00:29:41,572
Even if you had killed
the guard,

538
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:43,823
you never would have reached
the runabout.

539
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:47,369
I guess we'll never know that.

540
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:49,413
<i>I</i> know.

541
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:53,917
I'm sure you do.

542
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,466
You're not like
the other human.

543
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:03,302
We have our differences.

544
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:05,638
You don't like helping us.

545
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:11,143
No, I don't.

546
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,227
Good.

547
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,812
I don't like it, either.

548
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:17,524
Well, I'm glad
we understand each other.

549
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:24,072
Slowly.

550
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,160
Now, put it down.

551
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:04,738
(<i> sighs</i> ):
Nothing.

552
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:08,033
I can find nothing in
the atmosphere, the soil,

553
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:10,285
the water, the plant
or the animal life

554
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,830
that is remotely compatible
to your cellular structure

555
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,789
or your DNA.

556
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:15,207
Maybe you were exposed

557
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:17,835
to some anomalous
conditions four years ago

558
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:20,170
that no longer exist--
a magnetic storm,

559
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:22,255
solar radiation,
volcanic gases.

560
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,632
No.

561
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:27,219
Everything is as it was
four years ago.

562
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:30,347
The planet is the same.

563
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:32,349
The conditions
are the<i> same!</i>

564
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:35,268
The answer must be here.

565
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:38,313
There is no
other explanation

566
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,023
for what happened to me.

567
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:44,152
Maybe there<i> is</i>
an explanation.

568
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:49,157
Maybe nothing happened
to you on this planet.

569
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:53,412
Maybe you were never addicted
to this drug at all.

570
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:55,330
But I took white
all my life.

571
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,374
But maybe you didn't need it.

572
00:31:57,374 --> 00:31:59,793
It's possible
that your DNA structure

573
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:01,670
underwent
a random mutation that...

574
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:04,256
He's escaped.

575
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,924
How?

576
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,427
Using their ship's transporter.

577
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,136
They planned
this together.

578
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:13,807
Do you know where O'Brien is?

579
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:15,642
No.

580
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:18,019
Deploy the men in a standard...

581
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,062
He's lying.

582
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,606
He's been lying for days.

583
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:22,232
There is no cure here.

584
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:24,651
Even if there was,
he wouldn't give it to you.

585
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,319
There is a cure.

586
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,572
I am the proof.

587
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:33,786
Now, deploy the men in
a standard search pattern.

588
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:37,956
Find O'Brien and return him
to the holding area alive.

589
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,958
Alive?

590
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,335
Are you questioning me?

591
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:48,801
I knew you once, trusted you,
obeyed you without question,

592
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:52,846
but now you're like this human--

593
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:54,473
weak,

594
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:56,725
soft, inferior.

595
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:59,478
If being free
of white means

596
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:00,771
becoming like you...

597
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:03,064
I don't want to be cured.

598
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,616
What'll happen
to O'Brien?

599
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,910
There is nothing
we can do for him.

600
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,996
My men will
no longer obey me.

601
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,081
You have to
find him first

602
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,918
and keep him alive
until I can find a cure.

603
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:26,254
If I go,

604
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:29,341
there will be no one here
to guard you.

605
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,718
I will not try to escape.

606
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,386
I give you my word.

607
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:36,932
I will do what I can.

608
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:55,200
I've been saving this
for a special occasion.

609
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,036
Tonight certainly qualifies.

610
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:07,295
How'd you manage to get these
out of the Tallonian system?

611
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:10,924
I have my resources.

612
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,850
A hundred percent pure.

613
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:23,102
Well worth twice
the price I'm asking.

614
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:26,481
I don't know if I'd go that far.

615
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,649
Trafficking

616
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:28,817
in illegal merchandise

617
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:30,736
is a felony under
Federation law.

618
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:33,238
What's he doing here?

619
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:45,166
A very good question.

620
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,961
I was just about to arrest
these criminals.

621
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:49,379
I should arrest you

622
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:51,464
for interfering
in my investigation.

623
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:52,465
Will someone tell me

624
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,509
what is going on here?

625
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,344
Odo, why did you not tell me
what you were doing?

626
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,137
I don't report to you,
Commander,

627
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,765
and I don't spread the word

628
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:02,726
when I'm conducting
an undercover investigation.

629
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:04,853
I also thought
that your surveillance

630
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:07,146
would make the setup
more convincing.

631
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:09,024
I'm not interested in this man.

632
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:12,151
He was supposed to complete
the transaction

633
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:15,196
and take the latinum
back to his ship,

634
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,282
so that I could infiltrate

635
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:20,159
the entire Markalian
smuggling operation.

636
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:24,581
Now I suppose I'll have
to settle for the middleman.

637
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:26,041
If you gentlemen
are finished

638
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:27,292
with this little fiasco,

639
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:28,919
I'd like to tidy up.

640
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:29,962
Quark!

641
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:40,013
ODO:
On your feet.
Let's go.

642
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:55,988
(<i> Jem'Hadar voices approaching)</i>

643
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:09,501
(<i> device beeping steadily</i> )

644
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:10,502
(<i> beeping erratically</i> )

645
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,671
I've lost the signal.

646
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:14,172
Spread out.

647
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:26,018
(<i> beeping</i> )

648
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:37,487
(<i> groans</i> )

649
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:51,626
Chief!

650
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:52,794
Where's the guard?

651
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:54,546
Everyone's out looking for you.

652
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,422
Good.

653
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:59,300
Anything else around here
we can use as a weapon?

654
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:04,139
No?

655
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:05,557
Let's get moving.

656
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:07,934
It's only 300 meters
to the runabout,

657
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,227
but those guys move fast.

658
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,022
Chief, I'm not going.

659
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,448
What the hell do you mean,
you're not coming?

660
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:23,658
I'm onto something here.

661
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,243
With a little more time,
I think--

662
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,745
I don't care
what you think.

663
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:27,996
This is our one chance
to get out of here,

664
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,664
and we've got to take it.

665
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,791
And it's also our one chance
to break their addiction.

666
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:34,669
Julian, even if
you find a cure,

667
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,129
they're going
to kill you anyway.

668
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:38,090
That's not true.
Goran'Agar--

669
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,174
Forget about him.

670
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:40,550
What about all the others?

671
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,260
They're still a bunch
of bloodthirsty--

672
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,930
Look, we haven't got enough
time to argue about this.

673
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,556
If you want to go, go.

674
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:49,559
All right.

675
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:51,144
I will.

676
00:37:54,231 --> 00:37:56,191
But you're coming with me.

677
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:05,909
There.

678
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,744
You can bring me up on
charges when we get back,

679
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:10,496
but there's nothing
to keep you here now.

680
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,290
So let's get going.

681
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:15,210
(<i> growls</i> )
(<i> grunts</i> )

682
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:24,343
You did this?

683
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:25,762
Yes.

684
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:27,722
I did.

685
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:31,476
Move... both of you.

686
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:32,518
This won't--

687
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:33,645
No discussion!

688
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:34,980
Move!

689
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,779
BASHIR:
There still might be a way

690
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:44,614
if I had another sample
of your blood.

691
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:46,032
There is no more time.

692
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:48,285
The supply of white
will run out tomorrow.

693
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:54,166
(<i> clanging and grunting</i> )

694
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,048
(<i> growling</i> )

695
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:05,426
You caught him.

696
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,595
I shouldn't
have doubted you.

697
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:12,433
Should we kill them ourselves
or let the others?

698
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,352
I will do the killing.

699
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:36,041
Take your ship and go.

700
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:41,046
Goran'Agar, if you stay here,
they'll kill you.

701
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:43,715
Unless I kill them first.

702
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,758
It would be better
for them to die

703
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:47,552
quickly in battle,
than slowly

704
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:48,970
as the drug runs out.

705
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,388
You don't have to do this.

706
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,015
Even if we can't
save their lives,

707
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:54,309
there's no need to
sacrifice yourself.

708
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,022
You are a soldier?

709
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:00,857
I have been.

710
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:04,110
Then you explain.

711
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:17,207
He's their Commander.

712
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:19,667
They trusted him.

713
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,711
He can't leave them.

714
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,808
Julian.

715
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,870
(<i> door chimes</i> )

716
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:56,955
Come in.

717
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,253
Captain, there's
some information

718
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:04,421
I would like to add

719
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:06,881
to Security Chief Odo's
last report.

720
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:14,806
He did not feel
it was necessary

721
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:17,934
to include the details
of my involvement, but...

722
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:21,813
I think you should know that I
hindered his investigation.

723
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,731
Yes, I heard what happened.

724
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:27,568
Please, sit.

725
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:36,411
Word gets around
in a place like this.

726
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:39,538
It's<i> one</i> of the things
you have to get used to.

727
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:42,459
One of many things, it seems.

728
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:45,337
Starfleet officers
often have trouble

729
00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:47,630
learning the
unofficial rules

730
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,756
of the station.

731
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,758
There's no manual
to study.

732
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:54,012
You have to learn
things as you go.

733
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:58,599
A little different
than life on a starship.

734
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:01,394
When I served
aboard the<i> Enterprise,</i>

735
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:02,728
I always knew

736
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:06,232
who were my allies
and who were my enemies.

737
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:12,071
Let's just say DS9
has more shades of gray,

738
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:17,285
and Quark definitely is
a shade of... gray.

739
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:20,246
He has his own set of rules,

740
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,831
and he follows
them diligently.

741
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:24,042
Once you understand them,
you understand Quark.

742
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:27,628
I'd say that's true
for... everyone here.

743
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:36,804
You'll fit in, Commander.

744
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:42,935
Just give it time.

745
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:53,905
Kira to<i> Rubicon.</i>

746
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,990
Docking Platform 2 is open.

747
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,283
Welcome back, gentlemen.

748
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,451
Thanks, Major.

749
00:43:04,541 --> 00:43:07,126
You can bring me up
on charges, you know.

750
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:10,547
Well, that's not
really my style.

751
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:15,927
I wish things could have
been different, Julian.

752
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:18,054
So do I.

753
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:24,060
And I'm sorry I had
to destroy your work.

754
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,938
You didn't<i> have</i> to, Chief.

755
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:28,147
You had a choice,

756
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:31,568
and you chose
to disobey orders,

757
00:43:31,568 --> 00:43:34,487
override my judgment,

758
00:43:34,487 --> 00:43:37,698
and condemn those men to death.

759
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,658
Yes, I did...

760
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:42,245
because I thought it was
the only way to save your life.

761
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:44,163
Whatever else
you may think

762
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:46,040
of who I am
and what I did,

763
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,293
at least try to understand that.

764
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:58,052
Tonight's supposed to be
our weekly darts game.

765
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:00,012
Don't worry.

766
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:02,307
I don't feel
much like playing either.

767
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:08,813
Maybe in a few days.
