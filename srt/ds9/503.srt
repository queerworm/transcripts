1
00:00:18,395 --> 00:00:19,863
Doctor?

2
00:00:19,898 --> 00:00:21,800
Oh, hello, Quark.

3
00:00:21,835 --> 00:00:22,860
Oh...

4
00:00:22,904 --> 00:00:24,533
Let me guess...

5
00:00:24,574 --> 00:00:27,205
eavesdropping
on the battling O'Briens.

6
00:00:27,246 --> 00:00:28,840
Don't be ridiculous.

7
00:00:28,883 --> 00:00:31,217
Such language.

8
00:00:31,254 --> 00:00:33,919
Oh, I hope Molly's not around.

9
00:00:33,959 --> 00:00:36,556
You can hear what they're
saying in there?

10
00:00:36,598 --> 00:00:38,227
How could I not?

11
00:00:38,268 --> 00:00:39,702
Well, what are they saying?

12
00:00:39,738 --> 00:00:43,906
Let's use a little discretion,
shall we?

13
00:00:46,952 --> 00:00:49,013
He's done something.

14
00:00:49,056 --> 00:00:50,753
She's outraged.

15
00:00:50,793 --> 00:00:52,763
He thinks she's overreacting.

16
00:00:52,797 --> 00:00:55,097
She thinks he's trying
to run her life.

17
00:00:55,135 --> 00:00:57,128
Pretty boring, actually...

18
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,277
but to hear them

19
00:01:00,312 --> 00:01:02,714
you'd think it was a matter
of life and death.

20
00:01:02,751 --> 00:01:04,653
Hello, Julian.

21
00:01:06,424 --> 00:01:07,619
Hello.

22
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,220
Quark.

23
00:01:09,263 --> 00:01:11,563
Mrs. O'Brien.

24
00:01:11,602 --> 00:01:14,540
I thought you said the O'Briens
were arguing in there.

25
00:01:14,573 --> 00:01:16,406
Not Miles and Keiko...

26
00:01:16,444 --> 00:01:19,746
the other O'Briens,
Miles and Kira.

27
00:01:19,785 --> 00:01:21,755
What do they have
to argue about?

28
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:23,884
Miles hid Kira's
springball racket

29
00:01:23,926 --> 00:01:25,896
because she's carrying his baby

30
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,423
and he doesn't want her
taking any risks

31
00:01:28,468 --> 00:01:31,099
and she doesn't want him
controlling her...

32
00:01:32,309 --> 00:01:34,779
What?

33
00:01:34,815 --> 00:01:36,614
Keiko made them stop.

34
00:01:36,652 --> 00:01:40,285
Now they're in the "let's talk
this out and share our feelings"

35
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,624
part of the fight.

36
00:01:42,664 --> 00:01:44,293
Show's over.

37
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:47,499
Oh, well.
I mean, good.

38
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:49,099
It is the power of his voice

39
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:50,840
the strength of his intonation

40
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,941
that make Barak-Kadan
a great singer.

41
00:01:52,984 --> 00:01:54,647
There are none like him.

42
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,156
None as boring anyway.

43
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,251
He never varies his performance

44
00:01:58,294 --> 00:01:59,888
not even by a half-tone.

45
00:01:59,931 --> 00:02:02,197
I prefer traditional
opera performed

46
00:02:02,236 --> 00:02:03,830
in the traditional manner.

47
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,845
You know, for a Klingon
who was raised by humans

48
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,439
wears a Starfleet uniform

49
00:02:08,481 --> 00:02:10,576
and drinks prune juice

50
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,816
you're pretty attached
to tradition.

51
00:02:12,857 --> 00:02:14,850
But that's okay.

52
00:02:14,895 --> 00:02:17,492
I like a man riddled
with contradictions.

53
00:02:29,356 --> 00:02:30,950
That's a welcome sight.

54
00:02:30,993 --> 00:02:32,963
The peace talks
must be going well

55
00:02:32,997 --> 00:02:35,331
if the Klingons are
back on the station.

56
00:02:35,368 --> 00:02:36,666
Worf?

57
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,743
Did you see her?

58
00:02:42,784 --> 00:02:44,310
The Klingon woman?

59
00:02:44,353 --> 00:02:48,088
She was glorious.

60
00:03:04,861 --> 00:03:06,329
Her?

61
00:03:06,364 --> 00:03:08,027
She's okay.

62
00:03:10,338 --> 00:03:12,638
I have never seen such a woman.

63
00:03:12,676 --> 00:03:15,341
Who is she?
What House is she from?

64
00:03:15,382 --> 00:03:19,789
I do not recognize
her family crest.

65
00:03:38,661 --> 00:03:41,861
She is a friend of the Ferengi.

66
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,738
Now I remember who she is.

67
00:03:46,778 --> 00:03:49,409
Her name is Grilka.

68
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,581
And she's not just
Quark's friend...

69
00:03:52,622 --> 00:03:54,785
she's his ex-wife.

70
00:05:58,294 --> 00:05:59,626
Maporian ale

71
00:05:59,663 --> 00:06:01,895
with just a hint
of <i>pazafer</i> as I recall.

72
00:06:01,935 --> 00:06:03,905
You remember.
I'm honored.

73
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:04,998
How could I forget?

74
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:06,704
You're the only Klingon I know

75
00:06:06,744 --> 00:06:09,078
who drinks something
besides bloodwine...

76
00:06:09,116 --> 00:06:10,084
or prune juice.

77
00:06:10,118 --> 00:06:11,917
Prune juice?

78
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,822
Forget it.

79
00:06:13,926 --> 00:06:15,589
To the House of Grilka.

80
00:06:15,628 --> 00:06:18,429
May it continue to be
as strong and as proud

81
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:20,403
as its lady is beautiful.

82
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,613
You may not have been
the ideal husband

83
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:30,521
but you are
an excellent bartender.

84
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:32,551
I know of no greater compliment.

85
00:06:34,566 --> 00:06:36,399
So...

86
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:39,603
what brings you
to my humble establishment?

87
00:06:39,643 --> 00:06:41,306
Business or pleasure?

88
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:50,586
The recent hostilities between
the Federation and the Empire

89
00:06:50,631 --> 00:06:53,762
have been very costly
to my family.

90
00:06:53,804 --> 00:06:58,746
We have suffered great losses
in ships, lands, warriors.

91
00:06:58,781 --> 00:07:00,683
War... what is it good for?

92
00:07:00,718 --> 00:07:03,188
If you ask me,
absolutely nothing.

93
00:07:03,224 --> 00:07:07,255
The financial cost
was significant.

94
00:07:07,298 --> 00:07:08,858
I have an idea.

95
00:07:08,935 --> 00:07:12,670
Why don't I take a look
at your financial records?

96
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:14,975
I know that's not
why you're here.

97
00:07:15,014 --> 00:07:17,416
I'm sure it's simply
a social visit

98
00:07:17,452 --> 00:07:18,852
but maybe I could help.

99
00:07:18,888 --> 00:07:21,758
Very well.

100
00:07:21,794 --> 00:07:27,363
If it pleases you, I will
allow you access to the records.

101
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,238
Thank you.

102
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,621
Hear this, Ferengi.

103
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:41,929
Help Grilka and you live.

104
00:07:42,001 --> 00:07:43,630
Fail...

105
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:47,547
and I will kill you myself.

106
00:07:49,718 --> 00:07:51,813
And even though
it was an accident

107
00:07:51,855 --> 00:07:55,055
Quark took credit
for killing Grilka's husband.

108
00:07:55,096 --> 00:07:56,223
Why?

109
00:07:56,264 --> 00:07:58,530
As a way of boosting
business at the bar.

110
00:07:58,569 --> 00:07:59,901
And it worked.

111
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,532
But then Grilka kidnapped Quark

112
00:08:01,575 --> 00:08:03,841
and took him back
to the Klingon Homeworld

113
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:04,847
and married him.

114
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:06,281
Why?

115
00:08:06,318 --> 00:08:08,151
I'm getting to that.

116
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:12,960
As a woman, Grilka was forbidden
to lead her House.

117
00:08:12,998 --> 00:08:16,402
By marrying Quark, she could
retain control through him.

118
00:08:16,438 --> 00:08:20,378
Eventually, she convinced
the Council to give her control

119
00:08:20,413 --> 00:08:22,610
and she divorced Quark
on the spot.

120
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:23,948
As far as I know

121
00:08:23,986 --> 00:08:26,252
that's the last time
they saw each other.

122
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,488
A marriage of convenience.

123
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:30,624
Certainly for Grilka,
but I'm not sure

124
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,499
how convenient it was for Quark.

125
00:08:32,537 --> 00:08:34,939
His opinion is
of no consequence.

126
00:08:34,974 --> 00:08:38,413
He is unworthy
of such a prize as she.

127
00:08:38,449 --> 00:08:44,189
Worf, it sounds like you have
a bad case of <i>par'Mach.</i>

128
00:08:44,227 --> 00:08:46,220
Is that contagious?

129
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:52,672
<i>Par'Mach</i> is the
Klingon word for love

130
00:08:52,744 --> 00:08:55,214
but with more
aggressive overtones.

131
00:08:55,249 --> 00:08:56,547
Love?

132
00:08:56,585 --> 00:08:57,610
Worf?

133
00:08:59,057 --> 00:09:01,995
Stranger things have happened.

134
00:09:02,028 --> 00:09:04,021
Especially around here.

135
00:09:09,477 --> 00:09:12,074
This should alleviate
Kira's sneezing.

136
00:09:12,116 --> 00:09:13,550
Should?

137
00:09:13,585 --> 00:09:15,418
Bajoran women
have been sneezing

138
00:09:15,456 --> 00:09:18,360
their way through pregnancy
for over 100,000 years.

139
00:09:18,395 --> 00:09:21,060
You can't expect me
to cure it overnight.

140
00:09:24,073 --> 00:09:27,136
You know, I heard a rumor
that the Jerries might be trying

141
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,047
to cross the Channel
this evening.

142
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:32,078
Maybe we should have a surprise
waiting for them.

143
00:09:33,425 --> 00:09:36,056
Serves you right.

144
00:09:36,097 --> 00:09:38,431
I can't go
to the holosuite tonight.

145
00:09:38,468 --> 00:09:40,961
Kira and I have some things
to work out.

146
00:09:41,006 --> 00:09:43,910
Still fighting, eh?

147
00:09:43,946 --> 00:09:45,346
Who says we're fighting?

148
00:09:45,382 --> 00:09:46,714
Well, word gets around.

149
00:09:46,785 --> 00:09:48,550
It's a small station.

150
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,080
It's a huge station.

151
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:53,097
Obviously not huge enough.

152
00:09:53,131 --> 00:09:56,069
Well, for your information,
we are not fighting.

153
00:09:56,104 --> 00:09:57,504
Glad to hear it.

154
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,444
Bajoran <i>takeo</i> herbs
for Kira's swollen ankles.

155
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:02,073
She'll need to dissolve them

156
00:10:02,116 --> 00:10:04,952
in some kind of fruit juice
before ingesting them.

157
00:10:04,988 --> 00:10:06,251
I hope they taste better

158
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,318
than those <i>makora</i>
herbs you gave her.

159
00:10:08,362 --> 00:10:11,562
Are you sampling
all her medications?

160
00:10:11,601 --> 00:10:15,405
No...
Kira didn't like the taste.

161
00:10:15,442 --> 00:10:17,605
Oh, by the way, I almost forgot.

162
00:10:17,647 --> 00:10:19,480
She, uh...

163
00:10:19,517 --> 00:10:23,548
she has a... a rash
on the back of her thighs.

164
00:10:23,592 --> 00:10:25,391
Do you have a salve
or something?

165
00:10:25,429 --> 00:10:27,331
How long has she had it?

166
00:10:27,366 --> 00:10:28,425
Well, I noticed it yesterday

167
00:10:28,468 --> 00:10:30,335
when I was helping her out
of the bathtub

168
00:10:30,372 --> 00:10:32,035
so she's had it at least a day.

169
00:10:32,075 --> 00:10:34,068
Helping her out of the tub?

170
00:10:34,112 --> 00:10:35,638
She's living in my house.

171
00:10:35,683 --> 00:10:36,981
She's having my baby.

172
00:10:37,018 --> 00:10:40,149
So, uh, did you look?

173
00:10:40,192 --> 00:10:41,353
What?

174
00:10:41,394 --> 00:10:44,195
Oh, please.

175
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:46,966
I was holding a towel up
in front of her.

176
00:10:47,005 --> 00:10:52,277
How does Keiko feel about you
helping Kira out of the tub?

177
00:10:52,316 --> 00:10:54,252
Keiko feels fine about it.

178
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:55,847
You see, we are adults.

179
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:58,827
We've developed
a close, mature relationship.

180
00:10:58,862 --> 00:11:01,230
I'm sure
that Keiko and Kira have

181
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:02,793
but you...

182
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,635
What about me?

183
00:11:04,674 --> 00:11:07,202
I'll bet you looked.

184
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:38,730
I will apologize for this
at a later time.

185
00:11:38,775 --> 00:11:41,268
You are in my seat!

186
00:11:43,952 --> 00:11:45,420
Bartender!

187
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:47,449
Bloodwine!

188
00:11:51,301 --> 00:11:54,900
What is that smell?

189
00:11:54,974 --> 00:11:58,573
Is there a pile
of rotting forshak in here?

190
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:04,220
Or is it you?

191
00:12:07,165 --> 00:12:09,362
Stand when I talk to you!

192
00:12:11,006 --> 00:12:12,805
Or do you think it is funny?

193
00:12:12,843 --> 00:12:14,209
<i>Mev yap!</i>

194
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,587
Worf, son of Mogh.

195
00:12:20,626 --> 00:12:23,291
Come. Join me.

196
00:12:28,642 --> 00:12:33,448
Challenging Thopok to a fight
is a waste of time.

197
00:12:33,485 --> 00:12:36,685
Grilka cannot mate with you,
now or ever.

198
00:12:36,724 --> 00:12:39,287
Your House is dishonored.

199
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,129
Your name is a curse.

200
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,795
I meant no disrespect.

201
00:12:42,836 --> 00:12:44,669
You showed none.

202
00:12:44,707 --> 00:12:47,338
I'm sure your motives
were honorable.

203
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:51,814
Do not let it
trouble you too much.

204
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,985
In truth, I doubt it would
have been a good match.

205
00:12:56,364 --> 00:12:57,832
Why?

206
00:12:59,035 --> 00:13:02,474
Have you ever pursued
a Klingon woman?

207
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,539
No.

208
00:13:05,582 --> 00:13:07,381
There's no shame in that.

209
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:08,887
You were raised by humans.

210
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:10,322
You wear their uniform.

211
00:13:10,359 --> 00:13:12,659
You accept their values.

212
00:13:12,696 --> 00:13:15,361
How could you know anything
about our women?

213
00:13:15,402 --> 00:13:18,135
You'd be surprised what I know.

214
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:19,505
Perhaps.

215
00:13:19,543 --> 00:13:21,809
But we will not find out here.

216
00:13:21,848 --> 00:13:24,445
It is the wish
of the Lady Grilka

217
00:13:24,487 --> 00:13:27,653
that you leave us now,
son of Mogh

218
00:13:27,693 --> 00:13:30,095
and do not return.

219
00:13:47,533 --> 00:13:49,969
I am a fool.

220
00:13:50,004 --> 00:13:52,338
You're in love.

221
00:13:52,376 --> 00:13:54,744
Which I suppose
is the same thing.

222
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,308
You're making
too much of this, Worf.

223
00:13:57,353 --> 00:13:59,721
Tumek said that Grilka
wasn't offended.

224
00:13:59,757 --> 00:14:01,488
She was probably flattered.

225
00:14:01,527 --> 00:14:02,961
There is no flattery

226
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,364
in a great lady
being courted by a traitor.

227
00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:11,645
Is that what's really
bothering you?

228
00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:13,981
Or is it that Tumek said
that you didn't know

229
00:14:14,085 --> 00:14:15,714
anything about Klingon women

230
00:14:15,756 --> 00:14:17,487
and you're afraid he's right?

231
00:14:20,532 --> 00:14:22,695
What do you want?

232
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,572
I want to talk to Dax
if that's all right with you.

233
00:14:31,319 --> 00:14:32,617
I need help.

234
00:14:32,656 --> 00:14:35,024
Grilka invited me to dinner

235
00:14:35,094 --> 00:14:39,467
and I need to brush up
on Klingon manners and protocol.

236
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:40,562
She invited you to dinner?

237
00:14:40,605 --> 00:14:42,131
In her quarters.

238
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,804
A private dinner.

239
00:14:43,845 --> 00:14:45,610
A very private dinner.

240
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:50,685
What's wrong with him?

241
00:14:50,725 --> 00:14:52,558
He's having a bad day.

242
00:14:52,596 --> 00:14:54,759
Oh, that's a shame.

243
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,900
Well, when Grilka and I
were married

244
00:14:58,942 --> 00:15:02,142
there wasn't a lot of, um...

245
00:15:02,181 --> 00:15:03,615
affection involved.

246
00:15:03,651 --> 00:15:06,316
So, what does a Klingon woman
expect from a man?

247
00:15:06,356 --> 00:15:09,192
Are there any secret
Klingon phrases I should know

248
00:15:09,229 --> 00:15:12,690
or do we just leap on each other
like a pair of crazed voles?

249
00:15:12,736 --> 00:15:19,672
Quark, Klingon mating rituals
are very... involved.

250
00:15:19,717 --> 00:15:21,380
It's not just
a one-night affair.

251
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:22,409
Two nights.

252
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:24,615
Whatever.

253
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,791
Look, I'm serious.

254
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:32,571
Grilka and I, we have
something...

255
00:15:32,609 --> 00:15:35,079
I'm not sure what.

256
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,648
But I want to pursue it.

257
00:15:36,684 --> 00:15:37,709
For sex?

258
00:15:37,753 --> 00:15:41,089
No!
Well, yeah, that, too.

259
00:15:41,126 --> 00:15:43,893
But there's more.

260
00:15:43,932 --> 00:15:45,548
She's glorious.

261
00:15:46,783 --> 00:15:48,115
So I hear.

262
00:15:49,756 --> 00:15:53,160
Look... if you're serious
about this

263
00:15:53,196 --> 00:15:55,359
then you have to take it
slow at dinner.

264
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,063
No innuendoes.

265
00:15:57,104 --> 00:15:59,438
No staring at her cleavage.

266
00:16:01,212 --> 00:16:03,079
So what do I do?

267
00:16:03,116 --> 00:16:04,448
You talk.

268
00:16:04,486 --> 00:16:06,649
You ask her
about her family's history

269
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,216
and their accomplishments.

270
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,787
She'll consider this
a great sign of respect.

271
00:16:10,831 --> 00:16:12,960
Respect?

272
00:16:13,002 --> 00:16:14,665
Okay, okay.

273
00:16:14,706 --> 00:16:16,004
I can do that.

274
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:17,533
Anything else?

275
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:19,878
Grilka is
from the <i>Mekro'vak</i> region.

276
00:16:19,983 --> 00:16:22,146
It is customary among her people

277
00:16:22,187 --> 00:16:24,680
that the man bring
the leg of a <i>lingta</i>

278
00:16:24,726 --> 00:16:26,753
to the first courtship dinner.

279
00:16:26,797 --> 00:16:29,769
Make sure it's fresh,
as if you have just killed it.

280
00:16:29,803 --> 00:16:32,673
Then use the leg to sweep aside
everything on the table

281
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:35,806
and declare in a loud voice,
"I have brought you this!

282
00:16:35,848 --> 00:16:36,816
"From this day,

283
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:39,116
"I wish to provide food
for you and your House.

284
00:16:39,154 --> 00:16:41,556
"All I ask
is to share your company

285
00:16:41,593 --> 00:16:43,495
and do honor to your name."

286
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:46,900
Then what?

287
00:16:46,937 --> 00:16:51,572
Well, either she accepts
your offer...

288
00:16:51,613 --> 00:16:53,947
or she has her bodyguard

289
00:16:54,017 --> 00:16:55,782
shatter every bone
in your body.

290
00:17:00,296 --> 00:17:01,594
Sounds reasonable.

291
00:17:11,953 --> 00:17:14,584
So did your father
just sit you down one day

292
00:17:14,626 --> 00:17:16,357
and say, "All right, Miles.

293
00:17:16,395 --> 00:17:17,658
"It's time to teach you

294
00:17:17,698 --> 00:17:19,463
about massaging
pregnant women"?

295
00:17:19,501 --> 00:17:21,937
It's an O'Brien
survival technique.

296
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,033
My mother hated being pregnant.

297
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:25,944
My father's massages
were the only things

298
00:17:25,981 --> 00:17:27,610
that kept her
from killing everyone.

299
00:17:27,652 --> 00:17:29,086
Sounds like me.

300
00:17:29,121 --> 00:17:30,384
Pretty much.

301
00:17:30,423 --> 00:17:31,949
She didn't swear in Bajoran

302
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,723
but she did like to use

303
00:17:33,764 --> 00:17:36,361
what she called
"descriptive phrases."

304
00:17:39,709 --> 00:17:41,235
Are those my uniforms?

305
00:17:41,278 --> 00:17:43,680
Garak finished the alterations
and...

306
00:17:43,717 --> 00:17:45,083
he sent these along.

307
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:47,682
He guarantees
the insoles will help your feet.

308
00:17:47,725 --> 00:17:48,920
Ow, ow...
ow!

309
00:17:48,961 --> 00:17:51,193
That wasn't
very convincing.

310
00:17:51,232 --> 00:17:53,395
I think she's actually
enjoying it, Miles.

311
00:17:53,436 --> 00:17:55,964
You better press harder
if you want her to suffer.

312
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,571
Harder, it is.

313
00:17:58,614 --> 00:18:00,641
Ow, ooh!

314
00:18:00,684 --> 00:18:03,952
You are a sadist,
Miles Edward O'Brien.

315
00:18:04,024 --> 00:18:06,324
Was your father
this cruel to your mother?

316
00:18:06,362 --> 00:18:09,232
Worse. I'd swear sometimes
you'd hear her screams

317
00:18:09,268 --> 00:18:10,668
halfway across Ireland.

318
00:18:10,704 --> 00:18:12,172
The neighbors didn't know

319
00:18:12,207 --> 00:18:14,336
whether to be worried
or titillated.

320
00:18:15,814 --> 00:18:17,807
Oh...

321
00:18:17,852 --> 00:18:20,084
here.

322
00:18:23,797 --> 00:18:25,699
You miss Ireland?

323
00:18:25,734 --> 00:18:28,433
You know, if you'd
asked me that a year ago

324
00:18:28,472 --> 00:18:29,998
I would have said no

325
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:33,743
but lately,
and I don't know why

326
00:18:33,784 --> 00:18:36,551
I've been daydreaming
about home.

327
00:18:36,588 --> 00:18:40,187
Maybe I'm getting
nostalgic in my old age.

328
00:18:40,229 --> 00:18:41,892
Mmm.

329
00:18:41,933 --> 00:18:44,028
You've got leave coming.

330
00:18:44,104 --> 00:18:46,131
Take three weeks and go.

331
00:18:46,175 --> 00:18:49,910
If I left,
who'd give you foot massages?

332
00:18:49,949 --> 00:18:51,212
Take me along.

333
00:18:51,251 --> 00:18:53,221
I can think of worse things

334
00:18:53,255 --> 00:18:56,557
than spending
three weeks in Ireland with you.

335
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:58,360
Me, too.

336
00:19:06,883 --> 00:19:09,115
Don't stop on my account.

337
00:19:09,154 --> 00:19:11,056
Oh, right.

338
00:19:19,441 --> 00:19:25,215
<i>BOW-cha-daay</i>

339
00:19:25,253 --> 00:19:33,566
<i>KEY-cha-day</i>

340
00:19:33,602 --> 00:19:41,676
<i>Me-Yo-ca-BEEN-eva-kaa-MOR</i>

341
00:19:41,719 --> 00:19:47,391
<i>LING-tomaH</i>

342
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:52,930
<i>oH-ma-do-VEE-kos ZO!</i>

343
00:19:52,975 --> 00:19:55,468
<i>OH-ma-do-VEE-kos ZO...</i>

344
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,128
I'm not going to ask.

345
00:20:03,195 --> 00:20:06,599
Look, I came here
to thank you for last night.

346
00:20:06,635 --> 00:20:09,630
Grilka loved it... all of it...
everything I did.

347
00:20:09,674 --> 00:20:13,375
Everything I said was perfect.

348
00:20:13,415 --> 00:20:16,012
So, I know nothing
about Klingon women.

349
00:20:16,054 --> 00:20:18,821
She said I had the heart
of a <i>Basai</i> Master...

350
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,021
whatever that is.

351
00:20:20,062 --> 00:20:21,325
It is a poet.

352
00:20:21,365 --> 00:20:23,528
A poet?

353
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:26,062
I guess I can live with that.

354
00:20:27,778 --> 00:20:29,269
What else happened?

355
00:20:29,314 --> 00:20:31,079
She spent about an hour

356
00:20:31,118 --> 00:20:33,179
talking about her
family history...

357
00:20:33,222 --> 00:20:35,921
a rather long and bloody tale

358
00:20:35,961 --> 00:20:38,592
but what else is new?

359
00:20:38,632 --> 00:20:42,732
Then, we ate the <i>lingta...</i>

360
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:46,043
which tasted really bad...

361
00:20:46,081 --> 00:20:47,572
listened to some noise

362
00:20:47,617 --> 00:20:49,678
which she called
Klingon music

363
00:20:49,721 --> 00:20:51,816
and then I left.

364
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:53,225
A perfect evening.

365
00:20:53,262 --> 00:20:54,423
Mmm.

366
00:20:55,867 --> 00:20:57,233
Almost.

367
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:00,333
Her bodyguard was giving me
threatening looks all night.

368
00:21:00,376 --> 00:21:01,867
That is to be expected.

369
00:21:01,913 --> 00:21:05,317
The idea of a Ferengi
courting a great lady is...

370
00:21:05,353 --> 00:21:06,787
offensive.

371
00:21:06,823 --> 00:21:08,189
You know,
it's attitudes like that

372
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:09,726
that keep you people
from getting invited

373
00:21:09,761 --> 00:21:11,526
to all the really good parties.

374
00:21:11,565 --> 00:21:13,194
"The heart of a <i>Basai</i> Master..."

375
00:21:13,235 --> 00:21:14,464
She said that?

376
00:21:14,504 --> 00:21:16,531
Could I make that up?

377
00:21:19,381 --> 00:21:23,617
I'm telling you, Worf,
she responded perfectly.

378
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:28,390
You really have the key
to this woman's heart.

379
00:21:28,432 --> 00:21:29,798
The question is:

380
00:21:29,835 --> 00:21:31,896
Can you help me unlock it?

381
00:21:35,881 --> 00:21:37,874
Yes, I can.

382
00:21:39,154 --> 00:21:40,953
We have work to do.

383
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:16,618
Quark.

384
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:28,108
<i>MoVas ah-kee rustak!</i>

385
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:33,184
<i>Kosh tomaH.</i>

386
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:34,959
<i>Kosh tomoh...</i>

387
00:22:34,999 --> 00:22:40,067
I mean,
<i>tomaH ehpaq Lukara kaVeir.</i>

388
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:43,810
<i>Ish-tovee chuCH thling nuq?</i>

389
00:22:43,849 --> 00:22:45,147
<i>Besh...</i>

390
00:22:45,186 --> 00:22:48,420
<i>besh-opar gree urch...</i>

391
00:22:49,828 --> 00:22:51,730
<i>Besh...</i>

392
00:22:51,765 --> 00:22:59,076
<i>opar gee urchun</i>
<i>tomaH te... te...</i>

393
00:22:59,113 --> 00:23:01,379
<i>te-doQ maugh-shta.</i>

394
00:23:01,418 --> 00:23:02,818
Enough.

395
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:06,518
You say the words,
but there is no feeling

396
00:23:06,561 --> 00:23:07,790
behind them... no passion.

397
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,766
Having to learn
all this Klingonese

398
00:23:09,801 --> 00:23:11,464
isn't helping my performance.

399
00:23:11,505 --> 00:23:12,871
Do not think of it
as a performance.

400
00:23:12,908 --> 00:23:14,605
Believe in where you are.

401
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:18,175
Put yourself in this place,
in this time...

402
00:23:18,218 --> 00:23:23,217
a thousand years ago,
the dawn of the Empire.

403
00:23:23,262 --> 00:23:27,430
500 warriors stormed the
Great Hall at Qam-Chee.

404
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:30,636
The city garrison
fled before them.

405
00:23:30,676 --> 00:23:33,876
Only the Emperor Kahless
and the Lady Lukara

406
00:23:33,917 --> 00:23:35,351
stood their ground.

407
00:23:35,386 --> 00:23:37,447
It was here that they began

408
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:40,519
the greatest romance
in Klingon history.

409
00:23:40,563 --> 00:23:42,362
This is ridiculous.

410
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,698
Ah!

411
00:23:43,735 --> 00:23:46,366
I'm surrounded by corpses.

412
00:23:46,474 --> 00:23:48,201
My shoes are dripping in blood

413
00:23:48,334 --> 00:23:50,804
and you want me
to feel romantic?

414
00:23:52,242 --> 00:23:54,873
Why am I putting myself
through this?

415
00:23:54,948 --> 00:23:57,818
Because later that night,
Kahless and Lukara

416
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:02,089
jumped on each other
like a pair of crazed voles.

417
00:24:03,631 --> 00:24:05,430
Yeah?

418
00:24:05,468 --> 00:24:07,199
One more time.

419
00:24:10,445 --> 00:24:11,845
This is the fourth theft
of equipment

420
00:24:11,881 --> 00:24:13,851
from Upper Pylon 3 this month.

421
00:24:13,918 --> 00:24:15,547
I don't know how
they keep doing it.

422
00:24:15,588 --> 00:24:18,321
We've changed the security
protocols three times now.

423
00:24:18,361 --> 00:24:20,695
It's not
the security arrangements

424
00:24:20,732 --> 00:24:22,030
that are at fault here.

425
00:24:22,069 --> 00:24:24,403
It's our friend,
the Chief of Operations.

426
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,273
Miles?
What did he do?

427
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,801
It's what he's not doing.

428
00:24:27,846 --> 00:24:29,144
He still hasn't finished

429
00:24:29,183 --> 00:24:31,312
upgrading the structural
integrity field

430
00:24:31,354 --> 00:24:32,652
on Upper Pylon 3.

431
00:24:32,689 --> 00:24:34,556
So half the bulkheads
are torn open.

432
00:24:34,593 --> 00:24:37,190
A child could find a way
into those cargo bays.

433
00:24:37,232 --> 00:24:39,795
Look, Miles is a very busy man,
he can't be everywhere at once.

434
00:24:39,837 --> 00:24:43,368
Sometimes it seems as though
he's not anywhere at all.

435
00:24:43,411 --> 00:24:47,146
He is doing a superb job under
very difficult circumstances.

436
00:24:48,354 --> 00:24:50,256
Ah...

437
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:52,784
Growing fond of the Chief,
are we?

438
00:24:52,829 --> 00:24:54,628
What are you talking about?

439
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:56,134
I've always liked Miles.

440
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:59,506
You've always liked the Chief

441
00:24:59,543 --> 00:25:03,881
but Miles
is a different story.

442
00:25:03,951 --> 00:25:05,146
Look, I...

443
00:25:05,188 --> 00:25:06,588
I am living with him.

444
00:25:06,624 --> 00:25:08,092
I am carrying his baby.

445
00:25:08,127 --> 00:25:10,655
Don't you think that
might change things a bit?

446
00:25:10,698 --> 00:25:13,397
How so?

447
00:25:13,438 --> 00:25:15,169
We're closer.

448
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:17,839
It-it's like I'm part
of his family.

449
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:23,119
Which part?

450
00:25:23,157 --> 00:25:24,455
What?

451
00:25:24,493 --> 00:25:26,827
Which part
of his family are you?

452
00:25:26,864 --> 00:25:30,463
Sister? Daughter? Cousin?

453
00:25:30,505 --> 00:25:34,570
Could we concentrate on
the criminal activities report?

454
00:25:34,613 --> 00:25:36,242
Of course.

455
00:25:36,283 --> 00:25:40,223
And I'll refrain from making
any further disparaging remarks

456
00:25:40,258 --> 00:25:42,558
about the Chief.

457
00:25:42,596 --> 00:25:45,363
I mean, Miles.

458
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:03,366
This consorting with a...
Ferengi

459
00:26:03,404 --> 00:26:04,702
is outrageous!

460
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,539
You forget yourself,
Thopok.

461
00:26:06,577 --> 00:26:09,208
You are the Commander
of the Lady's Guard

462
00:26:09,249 --> 00:26:10,376
nothing more.

463
00:26:10,418 --> 00:26:12,786
Do not presume to judge her.

464
00:26:20,438 --> 00:26:23,877
Tumek, Maporian ale for two.

465
00:26:23,911 --> 00:26:25,277
Mistress.

466
00:26:25,315 --> 00:26:28,583
You are an interesting man.

467
00:26:28,621 --> 00:26:29,919
I always thought so.

468
00:26:29,957 --> 00:26:31,790
Not much of a fighter,
of course.

469
00:26:31,827 --> 00:26:35,231
Fortunately for you,
they were only holo-warriors.

470
00:26:35,268 --> 00:26:37,761
Well, it's the thought
that counts.

471
00:26:37,806 --> 00:26:39,274
Yes, it is.

472
00:26:39,309 --> 00:26:42,110
And what are your thoughts,
Quark?

473
00:26:42,148 --> 00:26:45,245
Why play out one of
the most romantic scenes

474
00:26:45,288 --> 00:26:47,554
in Klingon literature for me?

475
00:26:47,592 --> 00:26:52,466
Why learn to speak Klingon
and observe our customs?

476
00:26:55,107 --> 00:26:57,704
Why do you pursue me?

477
00:26:57,746 --> 00:27:01,207
I only pursue those things
I wish to acquire.

478
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:03,746
"Acquire"?

479
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:07,595
Now you sound like
a Ferengi again.

480
00:27:07,632 --> 00:27:08,930
I am a Ferengi.

481
00:27:08,968 --> 00:27:10,597
That means I have a talent

482
00:27:10,638 --> 00:27:12,938
for appreciating objects
of great value.

483
00:27:12,976 --> 00:27:14,946
And I believe

484
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:19,148
you may be worth more than
all the latinum in the Quadrant.

485
00:27:26,837 --> 00:27:28,864
My Kahless.

486
00:27:31,346 --> 00:27:32,872
My Lukara.

487
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,255
<i>Mev yap, Thopok!</i>

488
00:27:38,294 --> 00:27:39,592
Forgive me, Mistress

489
00:27:39,629 --> 00:27:41,462
but I cannot watch
this any longer.

490
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,836
I will not protect a House
where you are welcome, Ferengi.

491
00:27:44,873 --> 00:27:46,307
You are a coward

492
00:27:46,343 --> 00:27:48,370
and a liar

493
00:27:48,414 --> 00:27:50,384
and you have no honor.

494
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:56,158
So tomorrow, you will kill me,
or I will kill you.

495
00:28:11,058 --> 00:28:13,528
Home two hours early?

496
00:28:13,564 --> 00:28:16,866
You better watch it.
I'll get used to this.

497
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:19,033
Yep. They don't need me anymore.

498
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:21,374
Home at 1700 every evening.

499
00:28:21,413 --> 00:28:24,749
You're such a bad liar.

500
00:28:28,092 --> 00:28:29,287
Hi!

501
00:28:29,329 --> 00:28:30,889
Hi.

502
00:28:30,932 --> 00:28:33,927
Sit down.
You look exhausted.

503
00:28:33,971 --> 00:28:35,565
Bad day?

504
00:28:38,012 --> 00:28:41,507
Miles, I think this woman
needs one of your famous

505
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:42,612
neck massages.

506
00:28:42,655 --> 00:28:45,320
M-my hands are pretty cold.

507
00:28:45,361 --> 00:28:47,126
I'm not in the mood, anyway.

508
00:28:47,164 --> 00:28:49,727
Well, I can see the tension
in your muscles from here.

509
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:50,737
No, thanks, really.

510
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:54,005
Oh!
Um, I'm going to Bajor tomorrow.

511
00:28:54,044 --> 00:28:55,012
Just for a few days.

512
00:28:55,046 --> 00:28:56,640
- Bajor?
- Yes.

513
00:28:56,683 --> 00:28:58,653
I thought
I'd take the time and relax.

514
00:28:58,687 --> 00:29:01,055
A friend of mine has a house
in the Musilla Province.

515
00:29:01,092 --> 00:29:04,827
It's quiet, remote...
no distractions.

516
00:29:04,866 --> 00:29:06,768
Perfect!
When do you leave?

517
00:29:06,803 --> 00:29:09,000
Uh, first thing in the morning.

518
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:11,204
W-W-Wait a minute.

519
00:29:11,245 --> 00:29:12,976
You can't go alone.

520
00:29:13,016 --> 00:29:15,452
What if you go into labor?

521
00:29:15,488 --> 00:29:16,547
Well, Julian doesn't think

522
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,058
that's going to happen
for another month.

523
00:29:18,092 --> 00:29:19,755
But he doesn't know for sure.

524
00:29:19,796 --> 00:29:21,595
Miles...

525
00:29:21,633 --> 00:29:23,364
maybe you should go with her.

526
00:29:23,404 --> 00:29:24,372
What?

527
00:29:24,406 --> 00:29:25,601
I can't go.

528
00:29:25,641 --> 00:29:28,272
I have a botanical pathology
seminar tomorrow

529
00:29:28,314 --> 00:29:30,147
but you said yourself
things are slow in Ops.

530
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:32,152
I don't think
that's a good idea.

531
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,347
Me neither.

532
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:36,123
Miles Edward O'Brien,
are you going to let

533
00:29:36,162 --> 00:29:38,655
the woman carrying
your unborn child

534
00:29:38,701 --> 00:29:40,671
go on a trip all by herself?

535
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:46,808
Are you two fighting again?

536
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:47,818
No!

537
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:48,842
Not at all.

538
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:50,185
Good.
Then it's settled.

539
00:29:50,256 --> 00:29:52,351
Miles, let's pack your bag.

540
00:30:02,949 --> 00:30:05,181
What if I just do what I did

541
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,681
the last time a Klingon
wanted to kill me?

542
00:30:08,727 --> 00:30:10,356
I...

543
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:14,031
throw my sword away,
kneel down in front of him

544
00:30:14,071 --> 00:30:16,702
and dare him to execute me.

545
00:30:16,743 --> 00:30:17,711
Yeah.

546
00:30:17,745 --> 00:30:18,770
He'll be humiliated

547
00:30:18,814 --> 00:30:21,752
and slink away
like a scalded <i>targ.</i>

548
00:30:21,787 --> 00:30:24,520
The only reason that worked
was because Gowron stepped in

549
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:25,527
and restrained your opponent

550
00:30:25,561 --> 00:30:26,995
before he was able
to kill you.

551
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,624
No one will stop Thopok.

552
00:30:28,667 --> 00:30:30,569
Dax and I aren't even
able to attend.

553
00:30:30,604 --> 00:30:33,906
So my choices are to not show up

554
00:30:33,944 --> 00:30:36,437
be branded a coward
and lose Grilka

555
00:30:36,483 --> 00:30:37,451
or die?

556
00:30:37,485 --> 00:30:38,453
Yes.

557
00:30:38,487 --> 00:30:39,580
Oh, come on now!

558
00:30:39,622 --> 00:30:41,285
There must be another way
out of this!

559
00:30:41,393 --> 00:30:44,524
You people have
rituals for everything

560
00:30:44,566 --> 00:30:46,195
except waste extraction.

561
00:30:46,235 --> 00:30:49,469
You must have a ceremony
or a secret handshake

562
00:30:49,509 --> 00:30:51,376
or something I can do?

563
00:30:57,458 --> 00:31:00,123
I have an idea.

564
00:31:19,301 --> 00:31:22,273
Oh, congratulations.

565
00:31:22,307 --> 00:31:24,607
How do you feel?

566
00:31:24,646 --> 00:31:26,275
Like a puppet...

567
00:31:26,315 --> 00:31:28,717
and I have some complaints
for the puppeteer.

568
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:31,156
You nearly wrenched my arm
out of its socket.

569
00:31:31,192 --> 00:31:32,319
The movement
would not have hurt

570
00:31:32,428 --> 00:31:34,022
if you were in better
physical condition.

571
00:31:34,064 --> 00:31:36,968
Exercise makes me sweat.

572
00:31:37,003 --> 00:31:39,303
You need to get some sleep.

573
00:31:41,212 --> 00:31:43,307
If your body's tired tomorrow

574
00:31:43,349 --> 00:31:44,875
Worf won't even
be able to save you.

575
00:31:45,888 --> 00:31:46,856
Bedtime.

576
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:47,880
Mm-hmm.

577
00:31:49,636 --> 00:31:53,167
I cannot believe the lengths
I'm going to for that Ferengi.

578
00:31:53,209 --> 00:31:55,679
I'm practically
giving him Grilka.

579
00:31:55,715 --> 00:31:59,348
What is it you see in her,
anyway?

580
00:31:59,388 --> 00:32:02,953
I mean, she's attractive,
but other than that?

581
00:32:02,996 --> 00:32:05,900
It is everything about her...

582
00:32:05,935 --> 00:32:10,103
the way she carries herself,
confident and strong.

583
00:32:10,143 --> 00:32:13,013
She commands those around her.

584
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:14,814
The proud tilt of her head...

585
00:32:14,853 --> 00:32:17,757
the way her face betrays
none of her true feelings...

586
00:32:17,792 --> 00:32:20,355
the power of her voice.

587
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:24,930
And her eyes... as hard
as separ gemstones

588
00:32:24,973 --> 00:32:26,966
and twice as sharp.

589
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:29,574
Sounds like you're
describing a statue.

590
00:32:29,616 --> 00:32:32,052
What would you do
with a woman like that...

591
00:32:32,154 --> 00:32:35,320
put her up on a pedestal
and clean her every week?

592
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,387
You do not understand.

593
00:32:37,431 --> 00:32:38,797
If I were in your shoes

594
00:32:38,834 --> 00:32:42,797
I would be looking for someone
a little more entertaining

595
00:32:42,842 --> 00:32:45,210
a little more fun

596
00:32:45,247 --> 00:32:50,019
and maybe even
a little more attainable.

597
00:32:50,057 --> 00:32:52,756
You are not in my shoes.

598
00:32:52,796 --> 00:32:53,957
Too bad.

599
00:32:53,998 --> 00:32:55,865
You'd be amazed at what I can do

600
00:32:55,902 --> 00:32:58,372
in a pair of size 18 boots.

601
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:18,946
He's in position.

602
00:33:21,687 --> 00:33:25,320
Quark, son of Keldar,
why are you here?

603
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,891
To... to ans...

604
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:37,212
To answer the challenge
of Thopok

605
00:33:37,251 --> 00:33:38,845
to prove my honor...

606
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:43,991
and to win the favor
of the Lady Grilka.

607
00:33:49,543 --> 00:33:54,041
The challenge has been given
and accepted.

608
00:33:54,084 --> 00:33:56,851
Let no one interfere!

609
00:33:58,259 --> 00:34:00,320
<i>Mok!</i>

610
00:34:28,253 --> 00:34:30,816
Where did you learn to
fight with a <i>bat'leth?</i>

611
00:34:30,858 --> 00:34:33,591
I'm a man of many talents.

612
00:35:06,362 --> 00:35:07,330
No!

613
00:35:07,364 --> 00:35:08,730
Wait!

614
00:35:08,767 --> 00:35:10,669
You damaged the optronic relay.

615
00:35:10,705 --> 00:35:12,105
Can you repair it?

616
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,576
I don't know.

617
00:35:14,611 --> 00:35:15,704
Well?!

618
00:35:15,748 --> 00:35:20,018
I claim
the Right of... Proclamation.

619
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,428
I've never heard
of the "Right of Proclamation."

620
00:35:25,467 --> 00:35:26,457
It is a Ferengi custom.

621
00:35:26,502 --> 00:35:28,369
Then it has no place here!

622
00:35:28,406 --> 00:35:29,932
I beg to differ!

623
00:35:29,976 --> 00:35:33,005
I am as proud of my heritage
as your are of yours

624
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:34,848
and I will not be denied

625
00:35:34,886 --> 00:35:36,753
the opportunity
to express myself

626
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:39,921
according to Ferengi custom.

627
00:35:39,963 --> 00:35:43,562
He has shown respect
to our traditions.

628
00:35:43,603 --> 00:35:46,598
We will do the same.

629
00:35:49,214 --> 00:35:50,705
What do you need to do?

630
00:35:50,751 --> 00:35:55,420
I must... make a speech.

631
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,986
About what?

632
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,057
About you.

633
00:35:59,101 --> 00:36:01,230
Get on with it!

634
00:36:01,272 --> 00:36:05,907
I do not know how,
but he is still alive.

635
00:36:05,948 --> 00:36:07,474
You must work faster.

636
00:36:07,517 --> 00:36:09,487
I'm going as fast as I can.

637
00:36:09,521 --> 00:36:13,222
Uh...

638
00:36:13,262 --> 00:36:16,359
to this end...
my blade soars...

639
00:36:16,402 --> 00:36:18,133
through the...

640
00:36:18,172 --> 00:36:20,905
aquarium of my soul

641
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:24,440
seeking the kelp of discontent

642
00:36:24,485 --> 00:36:29,052
which must be caught,
so that the rocky bottom of love

643
00:36:29,094 --> 00:36:32,191
lie in waiting with...

644
00:36:32,234 --> 00:36:34,363
fertile sand

645
00:36:34,404 --> 00:36:38,401
for the coming seed
of Grilka's affection

646
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:44,755
and yet, does this explain
my need for her?

647
00:36:44,792 --> 00:36:46,455
No.

648
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:50,299
It is like
a giant cave of emptiness

649
00:36:50,336 --> 00:36:55,278
waiting for the bats
of love to hang by...

650
00:36:59,354 --> 00:37:03,419
Well, I guess
that's enough talking.

651
00:37:05,166 --> 00:37:07,694
Now, back to the fighting.

652
00:37:07,738 --> 00:37:09,571
No showing off this time, Worf.

653
00:37:09,608 --> 00:37:11,042
Just get it over with.

654
00:37:11,078 --> 00:37:12,604
I was not showing off.

655
00:37:18,726 --> 00:37:20,662
End it!

656
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:23,464
If you insist.

657
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,719
Maybe not.

658
00:37:34,759 --> 00:37:36,490
Maybe...

659
00:37:36,528 --> 00:37:42,439
I'll just pick up
your sword and...

660
00:37:55,868 --> 00:37:57,804
Give it to you... I guess.

661
00:38:02,782 --> 00:38:05,720
Thopok, your honor
is satisfied.

662
00:38:05,753 --> 00:38:07,416
I return your weapon

663
00:38:07,457 --> 00:38:11,625
and discharge you from my House.

664
00:38:23,255 --> 00:38:24,518
My lady.

665
00:38:28,366 --> 00:38:32,238
<i>Do-MACH ah chee ghos eh-PAGH?</i>

666
00:38:47,704 --> 00:38:50,733
Congratulations.
You did it.

667
00:38:50,777 --> 00:38:54,216
What does she see
in that parasite?

668
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:55,344
Who knows?

669
00:38:55,386 --> 00:38:57,413
But they're on
the same wavelength

670
00:38:57,457 --> 00:38:59,723
and at least Quark
can see an opportunity

671
00:38:59,761 --> 00:39:01,161
when it's standing
in front of him.

672
00:39:01,198 --> 00:39:03,600
He would have to be
blind not to see it.

673
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:08,833
<i>MoVas ah-kee rustak.</i>

674
00:39:12,273 --> 00:39:14,641
Computer, <i>bat'leth.</i>

675
00:39:16,447 --> 00:39:19,544
<i>MoVas ah-kee rustak.</i>

676
00:39:22,459 --> 00:39:27,299
<i>Kosh tomaH...</i>
<i>ehpaq kaVeir Lukara.</i>

677
00:39:27,336 --> 00:39:30,604
<i>Ish-tovee chuCH thling nuq?</i>

678
00:39:34,952 --> 00:39:37,583
<i>Meklo boH ka Mech.</i>

679
00:39:37,623 --> 00:39:40,789
<i>Te-doQ roos ka Mech-TOH.</i>

680
00:39:45,872 --> 00:39:47,272
Ow!

681
00:39:58,665 --> 00:40:00,191
So I guess we're going.

682
00:40:00,235 --> 00:40:01,567
Looks like it.

683
00:40:08,351 --> 00:40:11,585
Tell me about this...
this house we're going to.

684
00:40:11,624 --> 00:40:16,362
It's a gorgeous
200-year-old cottage.

685
00:40:16,401 --> 00:40:17,733
It's filled with antiques

686
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:20,263
sitting in the middle
of a deep, dark forest.

687
00:40:20,308 --> 00:40:23,337
It's got three fireplaces,
two balconies.

688
00:40:23,381 --> 00:40:24,610
I see.

689
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:27,816
It's, uh, 20 kilometers
from the nearest neighbor

690
00:40:27,856 --> 00:40:29,222
30 to the nearest town.

691
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,753
Why am I not surprised?

692
00:40:31,798 --> 00:40:33,198
It gets worse.

693
00:40:33,234 --> 00:40:35,363
There's a view.

694
00:40:35,405 --> 00:40:36,373
Of what?

695
00:40:36,407 --> 00:40:37,432
Of the Holana River.

696
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:39,275
You can see it from every room
in the house

697
00:40:39,313 --> 00:40:41,978
and at night,
when the stars are out

698
00:40:42,019 --> 00:40:44,251
and you can only hear
rushing water

699
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:48,253
it may be one of the most
romantic spots

700
00:40:48,298 --> 00:40:49,266
in all of Bajor.

701
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,860
That's it.

702
00:40:50,902 --> 00:40:52,234
I'm not going.

703
00:40:52,272 --> 00:40:54,401
I don't care what Keiko says,
I'm not going.

704
00:40:54,443 --> 00:40:55,411
You go.

705
00:40:55,445 --> 00:40:56,811
I'll wait an hour

706
00:40:56,848 --> 00:40:58,647
and then I'll, I'll tell her
that you left without me.

707
00:40:58,685 --> 00:40:59,778
That there was
a miscommunication

708
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:00,788
about the departure time.

709
00:41:00,822 --> 00:41:01,881
You think she'll buy it?

710
00:41:01,924 --> 00:41:02,892
She'll probably

711
00:41:02,926 --> 00:41:04,394
accuse us of having
another fight,

712
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:06,024
of behaving like children,
but I can handle that.

713
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,500
The important thing is

714
00:41:07,536 --> 00:41:10,303
that we don't go anywhere
near that place together.

715
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:12,642
You are absolutely right.

716
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:15,242
In fact, I'm going
to go to the capital

717
00:41:15,285 --> 00:41:16,719
and see Shakaar.

718
00:41:16,754 --> 00:41:19,692
That's the best idea
you've had all week.

719
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:25,697
Have a good trip.

720
00:41:25,739 --> 00:41:27,368
Thanks.

721
00:41:31,417 --> 00:41:33,216
It would've been nice.

722
00:41:34,723 --> 00:41:36,488
In another life.

723
00:41:37,963 --> 00:41:39,022
Let's not even think
about it.

724
00:41:39,066 --> 00:41:40,968
All right.
Let's not.

725
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:45,901
Miles?

726
00:41:45,946 --> 00:41:47,848
Yes, Nerys?

727
00:41:48,885 --> 00:41:50,582
Get out.

728
00:41:50,622 --> 00:41:53,355
Right.

729
00:41:57,869 --> 00:42:00,432
A compound fracture
of the right radius

730
00:42:00,475 --> 00:42:03,072
two fractured ribs,
torn ligaments

731
00:42:03,181 --> 00:42:06,085
strained tendons,
numerous contusions

732
00:42:06,187 --> 00:42:07,621
bruises and scratches.

733
00:42:07,656 --> 00:42:09,523
What have you been doing?

734
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:13,660
You mean,
what have we been doing?

735
00:42:16,974 --> 00:42:19,069
Never mind.

736
00:42:19,113 --> 00:42:21,481
I don't need
that particular image

737
00:42:21,517 --> 00:42:23,214
running around my head.

738
00:42:23,254 --> 00:42:24,722
I'll just treat you.

739
00:42:26,994 --> 00:42:28,623
What happened to you two?

740
00:42:30,669 --> 00:42:31,967
We, um...

741
00:42:32,004 --> 00:42:35,535
Well, um, if you must know...

742
00:42:35,578 --> 00:42:36,739
No!

743
00:42:36,781 --> 00:42:41,017
No, uh...
I don't need that image either.

744
00:42:41,056 --> 00:42:43,322
In fact, I'm going to stop
asking that question altogether.

745
00:42:43,361 --> 00:42:45,331
People can come in,
I will treat them

746
00:42:45,365 --> 00:42:47,358
and that's all.

747
00:42:47,402 --> 00:42:49,999
Please... have a seat.

748
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,067
I'll be with you in a minute.

749
00:43:12,519 --> 00:43:13,714
You do realize

750
00:43:13,755 --> 00:43:15,281
that according
to Klingon tradition...

751
00:43:15,325 --> 00:43:18,297
According to tradition,
we have to get married.

752
00:43:18,331 --> 00:43:22,169
But as you keep insisting,
you are not a traditional woman.

753
00:43:24,075 --> 00:43:26,375
The truth is, Worf

754
00:43:26,414 --> 00:43:31,550
at heart, you're not
much of a traditional man.

755
00:43:34,329 --> 00:43:36,663
You might be right.

756
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:39,228
How do you wish to proceed?

757
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:42,606
I don't know.

758
00:43:42,646 --> 00:43:44,309
You must have some idea.

759
00:43:44,349 --> 00:43:46,216
You were the...

760
00:43:46,253 --> 00:43:47,346
Aggressor?

761
00:43:47,389 --> 00:43:48,550
Yes.

762
00:43:48,591 --> 00:43:51,256
And now there are questions
that must be answered.

763
00:43:56,273 --> 00:43:57,468
Mmm.

764
00:43:57,509 --> 00:44:00,208
I don't feel like
answering questions.

765
00:44:00,248 --> 00:44:04,484
Why don't we just take it
one day at a time

766
00:44:04,523 --> 00:44:06,014
and see what happens?

767
00:44:11,069 --> 00:44:14,166
I, uh, do not like
the uncertainty

768
00:44:14,209 --> 00:44:15,700
of that arrangement.

769
00:44:17,849 --> 00:44:20,012
One thing's for certain...

770
00:44:20,053 --> 00:44:23,321
you've stopped thinking
about Grilka.
