1
00:00:04,964 --> 00:00:08,425
(<i> indistinct angry voices</i> )

2
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:19,687
Doctor?

3
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:22,815
Oh, hello, Quark.
Oh...

4
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:24,316
Let me guess--

5
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,944
eavesdropping
on the battling O'Briens.

6
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,779
Don't be ridiculous.

7
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,906
Such language.

8
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:33,492
Oh, I hope Molly's
not around.

9
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:35,953
You can hear what they're
saying in there?

10
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:37,371
How could I not?

11
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,331
Well, what are
they saying?

12
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:43,794
Let's use a little
discretion, shall we?

13
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:46,755
(<i> argument continues</i> )

14
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,883
He's done something.

15
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:50,551
She's outraged.

16
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,803
He thinks she's overreacting.

17
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:54,972
She thinks he's trying
to run her life.

18
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:56,974
Pretty boring, actually...

19
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,435
but to hear them,

20
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:03,230
you'd think it was a matter
of life and death.

21
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,356
Hello, Julian.

22
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:05,816
(<i> gasps</i> )

23
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:07,317
Hello.

24
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,986
Quark.

25
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:11,572
Mrs. O'Brien.

26
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:14,408
I thought you said
the O'Briens were
arguing in there.

27
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,451
Not Miles and Keiko--

28
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:19,538
the other O'Briens,
Miles and Kira.

29
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:21,582
What do they have
to argue about?

30
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,751
Miles hid Kira's
springball racket

31
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,920
because<i> she's</i>
carrying<i> his</i> baby

32
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,338
and he doesn't want her
taking any risks,

33
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,925
and she doesn't want him
controlling her--

34
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:32,175
(<i> voices continue</i> )

35
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:34,344
What?

36
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,638
Keiko made them stop.

37
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:42,143
Now they're in the "let's talk
this out and share our feelings"
part of the fight.

38
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:43,938
Show's over.

39
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:47,024
Oh, well.
I mean, good.

40
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,776
It is the power
of his voice,

41
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:50,318
the strength
of his intonation,

42
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:52,613
that make Barak-Kadan
a great singer.

43
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,114
There are none like him.

44
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,783
None as boring anyway.

45
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,952
He never varies
his performance,

46
00:01:57,952 --> 00:02:00,079
not even
by a half-tone.

47
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,331
I prefer traditional
opera performed
in the traditional manner.

48
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:06,209
You know, for a Klingon
who was raised by humans,

49
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:10,047
wears a Starfleet uniform
and drinks prune juice,

50
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:12,424
you're pretty attached
to tradition.

51
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:14,509
But that's okay.

52
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:17,137
I like a man riddled
with contradictions.

53
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:31,443
That's
a welcome sight.

54
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:33,070
The peace talks
must be going well

55
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,947
if the Klingons are
back on the station.

56
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:36,281
Worf?

57
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,329
Did you see her?

58
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,872
The Klingon woman?

59
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,875
She was glorious.

60
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,936
Her?

61
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,604
She's okay.

62
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,900
I have never
seen such a woman.

63
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,112
Who is she? What
House is she from?

64
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:17,990
I do not recognize
her family crest.

65
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,176
(<i> laughing</i> )

66
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,429
She is a friend of the Ferengi.

67
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,393
Now I remember who she is.

68
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,812
Her name is Grilka.

69
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:52,149
And she's not just
Quark's friend...

70
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:54,026
she's his ex-wife.

71
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:01,611
Maporian ale with just
a hint of<i>  pazafer,</i>
as I recall.

72
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,031
You remember.
I'm honored.

73
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,407
How could I forget?
You're the only
Klingon I know

74
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:09,953
who drinks something
besides bloodwine...
or prune juice.

75
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:12,664
Prune juice?
Forget it.

76
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,834
To the House of Grilka.

77
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:18,461
May it continue to be
as strong and as proud

78
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,463
as its lady is beautiful.

79
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,429
You may not have been
the ideal husband,

80
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,849
but you are an
excellent bartender.

81
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,684
I know of no greater
compliment.

82
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,313
So...

83
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:39,983
what brings you to my
humble establishment?

84
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,360
Business or pleasure?

85
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:50,869
The recent hostilities between
the Federation and the Empire

86
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:53,997
have been very costly
to my family.

87
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:58,752
We have suffered great losses
in ships, lands, warriors.

88
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,004
War-- what is it good for?

89
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,257
If you ask me,
absolutely nothing.

90
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:07,344
The financial cost
was significant.

91
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,470
I have an idea.

92
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,599
Why don't I take a look
at your financial records?

93
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,768
I know that's not
why you're here.

94
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,478
I'm sure it's simply
a social visit,

95
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,897
but maybe I could help.

96
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,775
Very well.

97
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:27,406
If it pleases you, I will
allow you access to the records.

98
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:29,283
Thank you.

99
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:38,208
Hear this, Ferengi.

100
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:41,836
Help Grilka and you live.

101
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,005
Fail...

102
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,841
and I will
kill you myself.

103
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:52,472
And even though
it was an accident,

104
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,350
Quark took credit for killing
Grilka's husband.

105
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,851
Why?

106
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,812
As a way of boosting
business at the bar.

107
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,188
And it worked.

108
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,190
But then Grilka
kidnapped Quark

109
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,152
and took him back
to the Klingon Homeworld
and married him.

110
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,569
Why?

111
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,405
I'm getting to that.

112
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:13,243
As a woman, Grilka was
forbidden to lead her House.

113
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:16,663
By marrying Quark, she could
retain control through him.

114
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,958
Eventually, she convinced
the Council to give her control

115
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,710
and she divorced Quark
on the spot.

116
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,423
As far as I know,
that's the last time
they saw each other.

117
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,758
A marriage
of convenience.

118
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,844
Certainly for Grilka,
but I'm not sure

119
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,887
how convenient
it was for Quark.

120
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,349
His opinion is
of no consequence.

121
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:38,601
He is unworthy of
such a prize as she.

122
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:44,399
Worf, it sounds like you have
a bad case of<i> par'Mach.</i>

123
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,443
SISKO:
Is that contagious?

124
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:52,991
<i>par'Mach</i> is the
Klingon word for love,

125
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,827
but with more
aggressive overtones.

126
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,871
Love? Worf?

127
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:02,334
Stranger things
have happened.

128
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:04,252
Especially around here.

129
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:14,221
This should alleviate
Kira's sneezing.
Should?

130
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,806
Bajoran women have been
sneezing their way
through pregnancy

131
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,683
for over 100,000 years.

132
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,269
You can't expect me
to cure it overnight.

133
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,191
You know,
I heard a rumor

134
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,984
that the Jerries
might be trying

135
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,903
to cross the Channel
this evening.

136
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,280
Maybe we should
have a surprise
waiting for them.

137
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,284
Serves you right.

138
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,619
I can't go
to the holosuite tonight.

139
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:41,206
Kira and I have some things
to work out.

140
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,791
Still fighting, eh?

141
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,502
Who says we're fighting?

142
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,170
Well, word gets around.

143
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,880
It's a small station.

144
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,798
It's a huge station.

145
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,343
Obviously
not huge enough.

146
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:56,304
Well, for your information,
we are not fighting.

147
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:59,307
Glad to hear it.
Bajoran<i> takeo</i> herbs

148
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,767
for Kira's swollen ankles.

149
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,561
She'll need to dissolve them

150
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:05,146
in some kind of fruit juice
before ingesting them.

151
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,814
I hope they
taste better

152
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,358
than those<i> makora</i>
herbs you gave her.

153
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:11,570
Are you sampling
all her medications?

154
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:15,532
No...<i>  Kira</i>  didn't
like the taste.

155
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,742
Oh, by the way,
I almost forgot.

156
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,536
She, uh...

157
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:23,582
she has a... a rash
on the back of her thighs.

158
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:25,542
Do you have a salve
or something?

159
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,461
How long has she had it?

160
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,129
Well, I noticed it yesterday

161
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,630
when I was helping her out
of the bathtub

162
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,173
so she's had it at least a day.

163
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,134
Helping her out of the tub?

164
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,510
She's living in my house.

165
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,095
She's having my baby.

166
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:40,265
So, uh, did you look?

167
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:41,682
What?

168
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,144
Oh, please.

169
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,980
I was holding a towel up
in front of her.

170
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:52,319
How does Keiko feel about you
helping Kira out of the tub?

171
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:56,156
Keiko feels fine about it.
You see, we are adults.

172
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,825
We've developed a close,
mature relationship.

173
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,328
I'm sure
that Keiko and Kira have,

174
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,912
but you...

175
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,664
What about me?

176
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,334
I'll bet you looked.

177
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:38,739
(<i> quietly</i> ):
I will apologize for
this at a later time.

178
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:41,368
(<i> loudly</i> ):
You are in my seat!

179
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,497

181
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:55,256
What is that smell?

182
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:58,593
Is there a pile of
rotting forshak in here?

183
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,265
Or is it you?

184
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,437
Stand when I talk to you!

185
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,815
Or do you think it is funny?

186
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,275
<i>mev yap!</i>

187
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,072
Worf, son of Mogh.

188
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:23,284
Come. Join me.

189
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:31,125
Challenging Thopok
to a fight

190
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,461
is a waste of time.

191
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:37,131
Grilka cannot mate
with you, now or ever.

192
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,300
Your House is dishonored.

193
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,177
Your name is a curse.

194
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,929
I meant no disrespect.

195
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,514
You showed none.

196
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:47,141
I'm sure your motives
were honorable.

197
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,812
Do not let it
trouble you too much.

198
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,982
In truth, I doubt it would
have been a good match.

199
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,818
Why?

200
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:02,490
Have you ever pursued
a Klingon woman?

201
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,452
No.

202
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,495
There's no shame in that.

203
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,913
You were raised by humans.

204
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,457
You wear their uniform.

205
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,751
You accept their values.

206
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:15,336
How could you know anything
about our women?

207
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:18,131
You'd be surprised what I know.

208
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,466
Perhaps.

209
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:22,135
But we will not
find out here.

210
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,471
(<i> loudly</i> ):
It is the wish
of the Lady Grilka

211
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:27,806
that you leave us
now, son of Mogh,

212
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:30,059
and do not return.

213
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,912
I am a fool.

214
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,332
You're in love.

215
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:55,335
Which I suppose
is the same thing.

216
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,878
You're making too
much of this, Worf.

217
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,256
Tumek said that Grilka
wasn't offended.

218
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,592
She was probably
flattered.
There is no flattery

219
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:05,428
in a great lady
being courted by a traitor.

220
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,476
Is that what's really
bothering you?

221
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,852
Or is it that Tumek said
that you didn't know

222
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:15,522
anything about
Klingon women,

223
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,440
and you're afraid
he's right?

224
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,484
(<i> door opening</i> )

225
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,529
What do you want?

226
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:25,448
I want to talk to Dax,
if that's all right with you.

227
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:27,158
(<i> grumbling</i> )

228
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,497
I need help.

229
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,957
Grilka invited me
to dinner,

230
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:39,295
and I need to brush up on
Klingon manners and protocol.

231
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,922
She invited you
to dinner?
In her quarters.

232
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,800
A private dinner.

233
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,510
(<i> whispering</i> ):
A<i> very</i> private dinner.

234
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,557
What's wrong with him?

235
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,350
He's having a bad day.

236
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,602
QUARK:
Oh, that's a shame.

237
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,938
Well, when Grilka and I
were married,

238
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,107
there wasn't a lot of, um...

239
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:03,444
affection involved.

240
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:06,865
So, what does a Klingon woman
expect from a man?

241
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:09,909
Are there any secret
Klingon phrases I should know,

242
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,871
or do we just leap on each other
like a pair of crazed voles?

243
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:15,874
Quark,
Klingon mating rituals

244
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:19,377
are very... involved.

245
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,254
It's not just
a one-night affair.

246
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,296
Two nights.

247
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:24,424
Whatever.

248
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,510
Look, I'm serious.

249
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:32,390
Grilka and I,
we have something...

250
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,934
I'm not sure what.

251
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,437
But I want to pursue it.
For sex?

252
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:40,899
No!
Well, yeah, that, too.

253
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:43,735
But there's more.

254
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,570
She's glorious.

255
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,155
So I hear.

256
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,993
Look... if you're serious
about this,

257
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,371
then you have to take it
slow at dinner.

258
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,081
No innuendoes.

259
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,500
No staring at her cleavage.

260
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,087
So what<i> do</i> I do?

261
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,631
You talk.

262
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,549
You ask her
about her family's history

263
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,259
and their accomplishments.

264
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,804
She'll consider this
a great sign of respect.

265
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,764
Respect?

266
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:14,682
Okay, okay.

267
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,016
I can do that.

268
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,685
Anything else?

269
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:20,688
Grilka is from
the<i> Mekro'vak</i> region.

270
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,774
It is customary among her people

271
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:24,358
that the man bring
the leg of a<i> lingta</i>

272
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,402
to the first courtship dinner.

273
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,823
Make sure it's fresh,
as if you have just killed it.

274
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:32,158
Then use the leg to sweep aside
everything on the table

275
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:35,745
and declare in a loud voice,
"I have brought you this!

276
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:39,039
"From this day,
I wish to provide food
for you and your House.

"All I ask
is to share your company

278
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,503
and do honor to your name."

279
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,421
Then what?

280
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:49,676
Well, either she accepts
your offer...

281
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,471
or she has her bodyguard

282
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,723
shatter every bone
in your body.

283
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,729
Sounds reasonable.

284

(<i> Kira sighing</i> )

285
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,450
So did your father
just sit you down one day

286
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,619
and say,
"All right, Miles.

00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,455
"It's time to teach you
about massaging
pregnant women"?

It's an O'Brien

289
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,126
My mother hated
being pregnant.

290
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,962
My father's massages
were the only things

291
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,630
that kept her
from killing everyone.

292
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,090
Sounds like me.
Pretty much.

293
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,092
She didn't swear
in Bajoran,

294
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,678
but she did like to use

295
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:36,096
what she called
"descriptive phrases."

That wasn't
very convincing.

I think she's actually
enjoying it, Miles.

303
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:55,867
You better press harder
if you want her to suffer.

00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:58,578
Harder, it is.

00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,086
A perfect evening.

358
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:55,421
Mmm.

359
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:57,256
Almost.

360
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,800
Her bodyguard was giving me
threatening looks all night.

361
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,970
That is to be expected.
The idea of a Ferengi

362
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,432
courting a great lady is...
offensive.

363
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,768
You know, it's
attitudes like that
that keep you people

364
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,187
from getting invited
to all the really
good parties.

365
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,855
"The heart
of a<i> Basai</i> Master..."

366
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:14,398
She said that?

367
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,609
Could I make that up?

368
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,863
I'm telling you, Worf,

369
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:23,241
she responded
perfectly.

370
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:27,578
You really have the key
to this woman's heart.

371
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:29,747
The question is:

372
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:31,624
Can you help me unlock it?

373
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,004
Yes, I can.

374
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:40,841
We have work to do.

375
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,394
(<i> grunting and groaning</i> )

376
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:07,034
(<i> Quark yelling</i> )

377
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,203
(<i> grunting</i> )

378
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:13,833
(<i> groaning</i> )

379
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:14,959
(<i> screaming</i> )

380
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,294
DAX:
Quark.

381
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:25,011
(<i> yelling</i> )

382
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:27,638
<i>MoVas ah-kee rustak!</i>

383
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:32,434
WORF:
<i>Kosh tomaH.</i>

384
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,812
<i>Kosh tomoh...</i>

385
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:39,733
I mean,
<i>tomaH ehpaq Lukara kaVeir.</i>

386
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:43,361
<i>Ish-tovee chuCH thling nuq?</i>

387
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:44,780
<i>Besh...</i>

00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:48,242
<i>besh-opar gree urch...</i>

389
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:49,409
(<i> yells in frustration</i> )

390
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,329
<i>Besh...</i>

00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:53,873

<i>tomaH te... te...</i>

00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,047
<i>te-doQ maugh-shta.</i>

394
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:03,299
Enough.

395
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:07,385
You say the words,
but there is no feeling
behind them-- no passion.

396
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:10,388
Having to learn
all this Klingonese isn't
helping my performance.

397
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:14,185
Do not think of it
as a performance.
Believe in where you are.

398
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:18,231
Put yourself in this place,
in this time--

399
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:23,485
a thousand years ago,
the dawn of the Empire.

400
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:27,240
500 warriors stormed the
Great Hall at Qam-Chee.

401
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,117
The city garrison
fled before them.

402
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:33,411
Only the Emperor Kahless
and the Lady Lukara

403
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:35,206
stood their ground.

404
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:37,415
It was here that they began

405
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:39,585
the greatest romance
in Klingon history.

406
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:43,297
This is ridiculous.
Ah!

407
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:46,092
I'm surrounded by corpses.

408
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:48,219
My shoes are dripping in blood,

409
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:50,888
and you want me
to feel romantic?

410
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,934
Why am I putting myself
through this?

411
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:58,354
Because later that night,
Kahless and Lukara

412
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:02,149
jumped on each other
like a pair of
crazed voles.

413
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,776
(<i> growling</i> )

414
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,569
Yeah?

415
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,238
One more time.

416
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:12,034
(<i> frustrated grunt</i> ):
This is the fourth theft
of equipment

417
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:13,577
from Upper Pylon 3 this month.

418
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,537
I don't know how
they keep doing it.

419
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:18,665
We've changed the security
protocols three times now.

420
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:21,835
It's not
the security arrangements
that are at fault here.

421
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:24,338
It's our friend,
the Chief of Operations.

422
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:26,173
Miles?
What did he do?

423
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:29,051
It's what he's not doing.
He still hasn't finished

424
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:32,388
upgrading the structural
integrity field
on Upper Pylon 3.

425
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:34,348
So half the bulkheads
are torn open.

426
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:37,143
A child could find a way
into those cargo bays.

427
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:39,728
Look, Miles is a very busy man,
he can't be everywhere at once.

428
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:43,316
Sometimes it seems as though
he's not anywhere at all.

429
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:47,153
He is doing a superb job under
very difficult circumstances.

430
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,197
Ah...

431
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,783
Growing fond of the Chief,
are we?

432
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,534
What are you talking about?

433
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:56,162
I've always liked Miles.

434
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:58,580
You've always
liked the<i> Chief,</i>

435
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:03,836
but<i> Miles</i>
is a different story.

436
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:07,214
Look, I...
I am living with him.

437
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,924
I am carrying his baby.

438
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,677
Don't you think that might
change things a bit?

439
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:13,346
How so?

440
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:15,055
We're closer.

441
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,850
It-it's like I'm part
of his family.

442
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:23,063
Which part?

443
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,564
What?

444
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:26,775
Which part
of his family are you?

445
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:30,404
Sister? Daughter? Cousin?

446
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:34,532
Could we concentrate on
the criminal activities report?

447
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:36,452
Of course.

448
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:40,289
And I'll refrain from making
any further disparaging remarks

449
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:42,624
about the Chief.

450
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:45,336
I mean,<i> Miles.</i>

451
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,472
(<i> growls</i> )

452
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,437
This consorting
with a...<i> Ferengi</i>

453
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:04,855
is outrageous!

454
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:06,648
You forget yourself,
Thopok.

455
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,692
You are the Commander
of the Lady's Guard,

456
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,236
nothing more.

457
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:12,946
Do not presume
to judge her.

458
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:15,366
(<i> Quark and Grilka laughing</i> )

459
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,371
(<i> shrieks</i> )

460
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:23,790
Tumek, Maporian
ale for two.

461
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,167
Mistress.

462
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:28,504
You are an interesting man.

463
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:29,880
I always thought so.

464
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,673
Not much of a
fighter, of course.

465
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,133
Fortunately for you,

466
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,094
they were only
holo-warriors.

467
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,096
Well, it's the thought
that counts.

468
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,390
Yes, it is.

469
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,975
And what are your
thoughts, Quark?

470
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:45,145
Why play out one of
the most romantic scenes

471
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,314
in Klingon literature for me?

472
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:50,359
Why learn to
speak Klingon

473
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,194
and observe our customs?

474
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,575
Why do you pursue me?

475
00:26:57,575 --> 00:27:01,078
I only pursue those things
I wish to acquire.

476
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:04,039
"Acquire"?

477
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:07,460
Now you sound like
a Ferengi again.

478
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,421
I<i> am</i>  a Ferengi.
That means I have a talent

479
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:12,714
for appreciating objects
of great value.

480
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:16,343
And I believe
you may be worth

481
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:19,054
more than all the latinum
in the Quadrant.

482
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,730
My Kahless.

483
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,692
My Lukara.

484
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:34,945
(<i> yelling in rage</i> )

485
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,031
<i>mev yap, Thopok!</i>

486
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,450
Forgive me, Mistress,

487
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,327
but I cannot watch
this any longer.

488
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:42,995
I will not protect a House

489
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:44,746
where you are welcome,
Ferengi.

490
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:48,167
You are a coward
and a liar,

491
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,336
and you have no honor.

492
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:56,216
So tomorrow, you will kill me,
or I<i> will</i> kill you.

493
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:13,484
Home two hours early?

494
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:16,694
You better watch it.
I'll get used to this.

495
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:18,780
Yep. They don't
need me anymore.

496
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,949
Home at 1700
every evening.

497
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:24,286
(<i> laughing</i> ):
You're such a bad liar.

498
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,623
(<i> door opens</i> )

499
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:29,041
Hi!

500
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,917
Hi.

501
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:33,753
KEIKO:
Sit down. You
look exhausted.

502
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,381
Bad day?

503
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:42,388
Miles, I think this woman
needs one of your famous
neck massages.

504
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:45,057
M-my hands
are pretty cold.

505
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:46,892
I'm not in the mood, anyway.

506
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:49,353
I can see the tension
in your muscles from here.

507
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:53,607
No, thanks, really. Oh!
Um, I'm going to Bajor tomorrow.

508
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:55,568
Just for a few days.
Bajor?

509
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:58,362
Yes. I thought
I'd take the time and relax.

510
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:01,073
A friend of mine has a house
in the Musilla Province.

511
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:04,535
It's quiet, remote--
no distractions.

512
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:06,537
Perfect!
When do you leave?

513
00:29:06,537 --> 00:29:08,788
Uh, first thing in the morning.

514
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,832
W-W-Wait a minute.

515
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:15,045
You can't go alone.
What if you go into labor?

516
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:17,715
Well, Julian doesn't think
that's going to happen
for another month.

517
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:19,508
But he doesn't know for sure.

518
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:21,301
Miles...

519
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,554
maybe you should
go with her.

520
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:25,305
What?
I can't go.

521
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,974
I have a botanical pathology
seminar tomorrow,

522
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:29,935
but you said yourself
things are slow in Ops.

523
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,937
I don't think
that's a good idea.

524
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:33,522
Me neither.

525
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,857
Miles Edward O'Brien,
are you going to let

526
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,735
the woman carrying
your unborn child

527
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:40,112
go on a trip
all by herself?

528
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,785
Are you two
fighting again?

529
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,495
No!
Not at all.

530
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:49,788
Good.
Then it's settled.

531
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,540
Miles, let's pack your bag.

532
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:05,178
What if I just
do what I did

533
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:08,557
the last time a Klingon
wanted to kill me?

534
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:10,350
I...

535
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,729
throw my sword away,
kneel down in front of him

536
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:17,149
and dare him to execute me.

537
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:19,359
Yeah.
He'll be humiliated

538
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,445
and slink away
like a scalded<i> targ.</i>

539
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:24,197
The only reason that worked
was because Gowron stepped in

540
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,659
and restrained your opponent
before he was able to kill you.

541
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:28,243
No one will stop Thopok.

542
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,329
Dax and I aren't even
able to attend.

543
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:33,540
So my choices are
to not show up,

544
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,959
be branded a coward
and lose Grilka...

545
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,877
or die?
Yes.

546
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:41,423
Oh, come on now! There must
be another way out of this!

547
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:44,134
You people have
rituals for everything

548
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:45,927
except waste extraction.

549
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:49,181
You must have a ceremony
or a secret handshake

550
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:51,266
or something I can do?

551
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,607
I have an idea.

552
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,568
(<i> grunting</i> )

553
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:22,506
Oh, congratulations.

554
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:24,424
How do you feel?

555
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,134
Like a puppet...

556
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,220
and I have some complaints
for the puppeteer.

557
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,263
You nearly wrenched my
arm out of its socket.

558
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:32,015
The movement
would not have hurt

559
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,642
if you were in better
physical condition.

560
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:35,602
Exercise makes me sweat.

561
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,938
(<i> chuckling</i> ):
You need to get
some sleep.

562
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,651
If your body's
tired tomorrow,

563
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:45,237
Worf won't even be
able to save you.

564
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:46,446
Bedtime.

565
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,531
Mm-hmm.

566
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,119
I cannot believe the lengths
I'm going to for that Ferengi.

567
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:56,081
I'm practically
giving him Grilka.

568
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:59,418
What is it
you see in her, anyway?

569
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:03,422
I mean, she's attractive,
but other than that?

570
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:06,299
It is everything
about her...

571
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,301
the way she
carries herself,

572
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,887
confident and strong.

573
00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:12,890
She commands
those around her.

574
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,683
The proud tilt
of her head...

575
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:17,770
the way her face betrays
none of her true feelings...

576
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:20,731
the power of her voice.

577
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:24,902
And her eyes-- as hard
as separ gemstones,

578
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:26,737
and twice as sharp.

579
00:32:26,737 --> 00:32:29,406
Sounds like you're
describing a statue.

580
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:32,284
What would you do
with a woman like that--

581
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:35,161
put her up on a pedestal
and clean her every week?

582
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:37,247
You do not understand.

583
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:40,667
If I were in your shoes,
I would be looking for someone

584
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:45,338
a little more entertaining,
a little more fun,

585
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,633
and maybe even

586
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:50,135
a little more
attainable.

587
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:52,638
You are not in my shoes.

588
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:53,931
Too bad.

589
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:55,641
You'd be amazed
at what I can do

590
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:58,226
in a pair of size 18 boots.

591
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:18,664
He's in position.

592
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:25,170
Quark, son of Keldar,
why are you here?

593
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:28,674
To... to ans...

594

(<i> electronic beeping begins</i> )

595
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:37,015
To answer the challenge
of Thopok,

596
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:40,101
to prove my honor...

597
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,770
and to win the favor

598
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,689
of the Lady Grilka.

599
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:53,824
The challenge has been given
and accepted.

600
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:56,618
Let no one interfere!

603
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,569
Where did you learn to
fight with a<i> bat'leth?</i>

604
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:33,363
I'm a man of many talents.

607

No!

608
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:08,356
Wait!

609
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,233
You damaged the
optronic relay.

610
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,860
Can you repair it?

611
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,320
I don't know.

612
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,989
Well?!

613
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:19,743
I claim the Right
of... Proclamation.

614
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:24,539
I've never heard
of the "Right of Proclamation."

615
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:27,459
It is a Ferengi custom.
Then it has no place here!

616
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:29,419
I beg to differ!

617
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:32,589
I am as proud of my heritage
as your are of yours,

618
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:34,466
and I will not
be denied

619
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,593
the opportunity
to express myself

620
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:39,471
according to Ferengi custom.

621
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:43,266
(<i> growls</i> )
He has shown respect
to our traditions.

622
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,978
We will do the same.

623
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,398
What do you need to do?

624
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:55,112
I must... make a speech.

625
00:35:55,112 --> 00:35:56,655
About what?

626
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,824
About you.

627
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:00,826
Get on with it!

I do not know how,
but he is still alive.

629
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:06,915
You must work faster.

630
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:09,167
I'm going as fast as I can.

631
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,460
Uh...

632
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:16,800

aquarium of my soul,

seeking the kelp
of discontent

635
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:29,104
which must be caught
so that the rocky bottom of love

636
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:31,857
lie in waiting with...

637
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:34,067
fertile sand

638
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:35,777
for the coming seed

639
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:37,988
of Grilka's affection.

640
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:44,452
And yet, does this explain
my need for her?

641
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:45,996
No.

642
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:49,791
It is like a giant
cave of emptiness

of love to hang by...

Well, I guess that's
enough talking.

Now, back to the fighting.

is satisfied.

I return your weapon

It's a gorgeous

It's filled
with antiques,

686

sitting in the middle
of a deep, dark forest.

687
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:24,214
It's got three fireplaces,
two balconies.
I see.

It's, uh, 20 kilometers
from the nearest neighbor,

Why am I not
surprised?

Of the Holana River.

You can see it from every room
in the house,

and at night,
when the stars are out,

695
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:44,609
and you can only hear
rushing water.

696
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:48,780
It may be one of the most
romantic spots in all of Bajor.

697

That's it.
I'm not going.

00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:55,203
I don't care what Keiko says,
I'm not going. You go.

699
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:58,539
I'll wait an hour
and then I'll, I'll tell her
that you left without me.

700
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,583
That there was
a miscommunication
about the departure time.

701
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,668
You think she'll buy it?
She'll probably accuse us

702
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:04,796
of having another fight,
of behaving like children,

703
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,923
but I can handle that.
The important thing is

704
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:10,176
that we don't go anywhere
near that place together.

705
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,804
You are absolutely right.

706
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,973
In fact, I'm going
to go to the capital

707
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,474
and see Shakaar.

you've had all week.

00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,900
Have a good trip.

710
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,402
Thanks.

711
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,074
It would've been nice.

712
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,369
In another life.

713
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:39,038
Let's not even think
about it.

714
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,748
All right.
Let's not.

715
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,753
Miles...?

716
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,672
Yes, Nerys?

717
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,425
Get out.

718
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:53,219
Right.

719
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:57,640
(<i> sighs</i> )

720
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,059
A compound fracture
of the right radius,

721
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:03,188
two fractured ribs,
torn ligaments,

722
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:06,232
strained tendons,
numerous contusions,

723
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:09,694
bruises and scratches.
What have you been doing?

724
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:14,115
You mean,
what have<i> we</i> been doing?

725
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:16,701
(<i> both laugh</i> )

726
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,953
Never mind.

727
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:21,164
I don't need
that particular image

728
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:22,748
running around my head.

729
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:24,334
I'll just treat you.

730
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:26,878
(<i> door opens</i> )

731
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:28,463
What happened to you two?

732
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,300
We, um...

733
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,303
Well, um, if you
must know...

734
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:36,929
No!

735
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:40,683
No, uh...
I don't need that image either.

736
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:43,019
In fact, I'm going to stop
asking that question altogether.

737
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:45,230
People can come in,
I will treat them,

738
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,939
and that's all.

739
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:49,692
Please... have a seat.

740
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:51,861
I'll be with you in a minute.

741
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:09,379
(<i> both sigh</i> )

742
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:15,051
You do realize
that, according to
Klingon tradition--

743
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:18,012
According to tradition,
we have to get married.

744
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,889
But, as you
keep insisting,

745
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:21,849
you are not a
traditional woman.

746
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:27,063
The truth is, Worf,

747
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:31,109
at heart, you're not
much of a traditional man.

748
00:43:34,404 --> 00:43:36,781
You might be right.

749
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:38,866
How do you wish
to proceed?

750
00:43:40,577 --> 00:43:42,287
I don't know.

751
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:44,205
You must have some idea.

752
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:45,748
You were the...

753
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,875
Aggressor?
Yes.

754
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,586
And now there
are questions

755
00:43:49,586 --> 00:43:51,045
that must be answered.

756
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:57,302
Mmm.

757
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:59,554
I don't feel like
answering questions.

758
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:04,183
Why don't we just take it
one day at a time

759
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:05,726
and see what happens?

760
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:13,859
I, uh, do not like
the uncertainty

761
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:15,403
of that arrangement.

762
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:20,158
One thing's for certain...

763
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:23,035
you've stopped thinking
about Grilka.

764
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:29,417
(<i> both laughing</i> )
