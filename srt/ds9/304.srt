00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:08,467
BASHIR:
I don't know about you,
but I'm starving.

00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:10,761
Me, too.
Here you go. Enjoy.

3
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:11,971
Thanks.

4
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:13,597
This looks delicious.

00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:15,516
(<i> sizzling</i> )

6
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:17,559
Now, Constable,
the secret of a good soufflé

7
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,060
is consistency.

8
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,522
You have to be careful
not to overwhip it.

9
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:23,148
I see.

10
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,400
I hope I'm not
boring you.

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,195
Just because I don't
<i>need</i> food, Commander,

12
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,238
doesn't mean I'm
not interested

13
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:31,532
in its preparation.

14
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,033
I'm fascinated

15
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,494
by the humanoid
preoccupation with eating.

16
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:36,578
(<i> gasps</i> )

17
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:37,997
Oh, uh, may I?

18
00:00:37,997 --> 00:00:39,206
By all means.

19
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:41,166
Oh.

20
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:44,378
(<i> sizzling</i> )

21
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,463
Ah...

22
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:49,424
Uh, nice and smooth.

23
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,177
That's it.

24
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,637
It's all in
the wrist.

25
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:54,680
(<i> laughs</i> )

26
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,558
Where did you learn all this?

27
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,935
In my father's restaurant
in New Orleans.

28
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:02,688
What are we having?
It smells delicious.

29
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:05,858
Blackened red fish
with creamed spinach
and sautéed beets.

30
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:08,027
Beets?

31
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:10,070
You don't like
beets, Doctor?

32
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,072
Well, they're not exactly

33
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,533
a, a personal favorite
of mine, no.

34
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:17,244
That's because you haven't
had them prepared properly.

35
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:23,500
Beets are a very
misunderstood vegetable.

36
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,837
Well, I look forward
to understanding it better.

37
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:28,505
(<i> door chimes</i> )

38
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:31,050
Come in.

39
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,845
Oh, what a day.
I just spent six hours
in one of the upper pylons

40
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,931
trying to get the new
sensor relay on line.

41
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:38,849
Help yourself
to something.

42
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,392
Dinner will be ready
in a few minutes.

43
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:44,438
Great. I've been looking
forward to this all day.

44
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,189
I hope you
like beets.

45
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,776
DAX:
I love 'em.

46
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:51,570
Keep at it, Constable.
Nice, even strokes.

47
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:59,244
You find something
amusing, Major?

48
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:02,414
Oh, I just think
you look so...

49
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:04,332
cute, I...

Whose is this?

51
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,429
It's mine.

52
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:20,432
I didn't know that you played.

53
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:21,767
I don't.

54
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,811
I took lessons
for a while,

55
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,687
but, uh, I wasn't
very good.

56
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,522
Oh, I know the feeling.

(<i> sighs</i> )

None of Dax's hosts--
even Jadzia--

00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:32,736
had any musical ability.

60
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,738
Nobody said life
was fair.

61
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:37,032
Even if you had
seven of them.

62
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:39,118
You would think
one of us

63
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:41,996
would have been born
without a tin ear.

64
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:45,040
Sounds like one of you
had some talent after all.

00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,089
That's lovely.

That's not it!

I don't know.

70
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,325
I don't believe
I've ever heard it before.

71
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,120
Maybe you hit
on it by accident.

72
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,246
You know,
beginner's luck.

73
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:27,833
(<i> sighs</i> )

74
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,460
But I know it somehow.

75
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,379
KIRA:
It's probably
something

76
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,548
from your childhood.
You'll think of it.

Your humming...
it's a little distracting.

I'm sorry, I didn't realize
I was doing it.

82
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,866
You've been humming
that same tune

83
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,076
since we started the game.

84
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,078
Guess I just can't get it
out of my mind.

85
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,123
Do me a favor.

86
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,084
Try.

91
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,525
Your turn.

You sure you want to do that?

00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:50,327
Your move.

94
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,083
Check.

95

Where did that knight come from?

96
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:01,963
Your mind is not on the game.

97
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,591
So you decided to make
an illegal move

98
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,176
to get my attention.

99
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,510
Of course not,

100
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,763
and it's a legal move.

101
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,432
You know, why don't
we just call it a day?

102
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,060
You obviously have other things
on your mind.

103
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,439
Curzon always suspected
you were a cheat.

104
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,983
Is this some kind of joke?

105
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,611
Don't play innocent
with me, Benjamin.

106
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,406
We both know you're trying
to cheat me here

107
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:29,449
so why don't you
just admit it?

108
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,965
Dax.

109
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:48,927
Did Sisko send you
to apologize for him?

110
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,387
No.

111
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,559
But he was concerned
about what happened.

112
00:07:56,559 --> 00:08:00,272
I thought you might like
to talk about it.

113
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:02,649
There's nothing to talk about.

114
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,485
You can't really think
he tried to cheat you.

115
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,528
I knew you'd take his side.

116
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:10,073
I'm not taking
anybody's side.

117
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:13,701
In that case, I think
you should leave, Kira.

I'll regret.

That's the first smart
thing you've done

over here.

How do you feel?

133
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,997
I feel like an idiot.

I'm so sorry about
all the horrible things

135
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,296

Don't worry
about it.

They're already
forgotten.

138
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:36,470
And I used to think
Curzon had a temper.

139
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,810
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

140
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,105
I feel like I have
so much anger inside,

141
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:48,773
and I don't know
where it's coming from.

This masked figure
in your...

Hallucinations.

144
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:57,449
Do you have the sense of
who it might have been?

145
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,409
That's what's
so strange.

146
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:03,580
He seems familiar, somehow,
but I don't know from where.

147
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,792
And the music.

148
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,253
Benjamin, I have to find out
what that music is.

149
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:13,923
Why don't you input
as much as you can
remember in the computer.

150
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,967
It might be able
to find a match

151
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:18,470
in the Federation
database.

152
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,305
I'll do it...

153
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,932
Well, as soon as Julian
lets me leave here.

154
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,142
Jadzia...

155
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:29,648
have you experienced any
hallucinations prior to this?

156
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:32,484
Never, and I hope
I never do again.

157
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:34,068
It was terrifying.

158
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,154
Have any of Dax's
other hosts?

159
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:39,157
No, believe me,
I'd remember.

160
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:42,118
Well...
according to your file,

161
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:45,288
the only major trauma
the Dax symbiont ever suffered

162
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:48,124
was when Torias Dax was injured
in a shuttle accident.

163
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,668
SISKO:
Torias--

164
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:52,170
he was Dax's fifth host,
wasn't he?

165
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,088
Yes, right
before Curzon.

166
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:58,218
It says here that Torias
remained in a comatose state

167
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,969
for just under six months.

168
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,055
There must have been
a lot of tissue damage.

169
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,182
The doctors couldn't keep
his isoboramine levels up.

170
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:06,309
Isoboramine?

171
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:07,935
It's a neurotransmitter

172
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,688
that mediates the
synaptic functions

173
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:12,731
between the host
and the symbiont.

174
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:15,694
When the levels dropped
to below 40 percent of normal,

175
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:17,696
they had to remove
the symbiont.

176
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:20,407
Sometimes the host
is sacrificed

177
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,949
to save
the symbiont.

178
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,494
Are you checking my
isoboramine levels?

179
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:25,870
Yes.

180
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,456
How low are they?

181
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:31,251
They've fallen
to 73 percent of normal.

182
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,836
Do you have any idea
what's causing it?

183
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,922
I'm not sure.

184
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,341
There's no tissue damage.

185
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,093
No synaptic
degradation.

186
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,305
Julian... am I
in danger

187
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,349
of rejecting
my symbiont?

188
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,687
I wouldn't worry about
rejection just yet,

189
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,146
but we do have to get

190
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,232
your isoboramine
levels back up.

191
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,067
And I suggest
we take her back

192
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,860
to the Trill homeworld,
and have the doctors

193
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,071
at the Symbiosis Commission
examine her.

194
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,207
Curzon always said

195
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,085
he wanted to show me
the Trill homeworld.

196
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:16,879
Looks like I'm going
to get there after all.

197
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,102
How long before
we reach Trill?

198
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:33,730
A little over 37 hours.
How's Dax?

199
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,565
Resting in
her quarters.

200
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,233
Hmm.

201
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,943
It's funny.

202
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,238
It's been almost four years
since Curzon died,

203
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,449
and I still miss the old man.

204
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:48,369
At first, I never thought
I'd ever get used to a new Dax,

205
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,789
but if anything happens
to Jadzia...

206
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:52,290
I know.

207
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,168
I feel the same way.

208
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:58,379
We'll just have to make sure
nothing happens to her, right?

209
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,757
Right.

210
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,770
(<i> door chimes</i> )
Yes?

211
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,107
Oh, good, I didn't wake you.

212
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,402
Not at all.

213
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,154
You having trouble sleeping?

214
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:25,198
Yeah, a little.

215
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,660
I could get you
something.

216
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,869
No, thanks,

217
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,912
but I could use
some company...

218
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,373
if you're not too busy.

219
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,999
Oh, no, no,
I was just reading.

220
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,418
Oh, anything I'd be
interested in?

221
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,422
<i>Trill Physiology.</i>

222
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,383
Just some background
research.

223
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:51,182
Look, um, Jadzia,
I know you're worried,

224
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:53,643
but the doctors at the
Symbiosis Commission

225
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,729
know a lot more about this
than I do.

226
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:58,439
I can't believe
I'm going back there.

227
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,025
I spent three years
as a Trill initiate,

228
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:05,238
and in all that time,
I hardly ever left the complex.

229
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,823
After I was joined,

230
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:09,743
I swore I would never
step foot in there again.

231
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:12,119
Was it really that bad?

232
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:15,206
No.

233
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:19,168
What I remember is
the endless series of tests

234
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,670
they put me through.

235
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,756
Well, considering the risk
of rejection,

236
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,382
you can't really blame them.

237
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,967
If they would have put
a symbiont in an unsuitable host

238
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,636
they'd both be dead
within a matter of days.

239
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,931
That's true.

240
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:36,269
I guess I had such
a difficult time, because...

241
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,898
I put so much pressure
on myself.

242
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:42,442
I wanted to be
joined so badly.

243
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,235
Well, look on
the bright side.

244
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:46,404
At least this time, you won't
be going there as an initiate.

245
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:48,489
No, I'm going there
as a patient,

246
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:51,618
and that's much worse.

247
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:54,995
I never told you this
before, Julian,

248
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,164
but...

249
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,375
I've always been
afraid of doctors.

250
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,878
Most people are.

251
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,463
When I was younger,
I was terrified of them.

252
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,466
Really?
Well, they seemed
to know everything.

253
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,302
It was as if they held
the power of life and
death in their hands.

254
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:12,096
I used to think
that if I didn't behave,

255
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,557
they'd make sure I got sick.

256
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,935
Then, as I got older,
I decided

257
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:20,187
that I wanted to know
what they knew--

258
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,148
be as smart as they were.

259
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,317
And that's why you went
to medical school.

260
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,735
That's right.

261
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:29,196
And you know
what I learned there?

262
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:32,659
That all I really wanted
to do was help people.

263
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:35,995
That's what doctors
are there for, to help,

264
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,707
so there's really no reason
to be afraid of them.

265
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,670
Now, if that
little story

266
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,590
didn't put you to sleep,
I don't know what will.

267
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,635
You're a very
dear man, Julian.

268
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,641
Listen, Jadzia...

269
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:59,686
you are more than welcome to
stay the night here if you want.

270
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,479
You can have the top bunk.

271
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,775
Are you sure you don't mind?

272
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,026
Absolutely not.

273
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,319
Up you go.

274
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,533
Okay... well, in that case,
if it's not too much trouble,

275
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,493
would you mind if I
took the lower bunk?

276
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,286
Curzon fell out
of a tree once and...

277
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,579
(<i> laughs</i> )

278
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,039
Whatever you want.

279
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,666
Thank you.

280
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,679
(<i> sighs</i> )

281
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:43,270
Is this light
too bright for you?

282
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:47,316
Dax?

283
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,905
Sweet dreams.

284
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:04,166
DAX:
After they finally finished
the neuro-response analysis,

285
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,793
another doctor came in

286
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,254
and ran a cortical
protein series.

287
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,297
Did they do a
bio-spectral scan
on the symbiont?

288
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,925
They had to make
an incision

289
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:13,718
so they could
insert the scanner.

290
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,807
Jadzia, it's good
to see you again.

291
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,267
Dr. Renhol.

292
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,894
Everyone's
very excited

293
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:23,978
about your being
here, you know.

294
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,855
Jadzia is
the only initiate

295
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,815
to ever successfully
reapply

296
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,068
to the program
after being dropped.

297
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:31,778
You must be Dr. Bashir.

298
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,153
That's right.

299
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,197
Commander Benjamin Sisko.

300
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,490
Ah, yes,
Curzon's friend.

301
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,284
Yes, I had
that privilege.

302
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,327
BASHIR:
Did you get a chance to look
over the test results?

303
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,955
Yes, I did.

304
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:45,207
As you noted, Doctor, her
isoboramine levels are low,

305
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:48,461
so I put her on a benzocyatic
regimen to compensate.

306
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,089
As you can see, there's already
a three percent improvement.

307
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:55,009
Will I have to stay here for
the duration of the treatment?

308
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:57,136
No, Dr. Bashir
can administer it.

309
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,721
But I do want to see
you back here tomorrow

310
00:18:58,721 --> 00:18:59,973
for a follow-up...

311
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:00,932
and for lunch.

312
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:02,683
I'd like that.

313
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,770
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I have an initiate

314
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,022
who needs some
hand-holding.

315
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,700
I don't know why
we came back here

316
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,285
when I could be
taking you on a tour

317
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,536
of the Tenaran ice cliffs.

318
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,163
You're not taking us
anywhere, Dax.

319
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,999
You're going straight
to your quarters to rest.

320
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,166
But...

321
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,584
No buts.
Doctor's orders.

322
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,420
But I cannot sleep
in the afternoon.

323
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,422
Just lie down,
close your eyes,

324
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,382
and try not to think.

325
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,093
It usually
works for me.

326
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,607
(<i> melody playing</i> )

327
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:07,665
Who are you?

328
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:11,002
It's beautiful... isn't it?

329
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:19,093
(<i> grunting</i> )

330
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,219
(<i> yells</i> )

331
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,181
(<i> groans</i> )

332
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,766
Dax!

333
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,894
Jadzia!

334
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:30,437
(<i> gasps</i> )

335
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:57,423
I don't understand
why she'd have
another hallucination.

336
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,008
I've checked
her isoboramine levels.

337
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:00,300
They've risen
another six percent.

338
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,969
That's a
larger increase

339
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,512
than I'd
anticipated.

340
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,931
The suddenness
could be

341
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:06,766
what triggered
the hallucination.

342
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,060
I want you
to begin administering

343
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,312
more frequent treatments
at a lower dosage.

344
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,397
DAX:
Doctor...

345
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,235
the people who attacked me--

346
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:19,070
they were from
the Symbiosis Commission.

347
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,530
Hallucinations
often take the form

348
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,949
of latent anxieties

349
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,450
and we all know the time
you spent here

350
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,035
wasn't that
easy for you.

351
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:28,246
But the uniforms
they were wearing--

352
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:30,414
they were from
over 100 years ago.

353
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:33,251
That was long before
Jadzia was an initiate.

354
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:34,752
And none of my other hosts

355
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:36,587
had any bad memories
of being here.

356
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:39,132
Well, with seven lifetimes'
worth of memories

357
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:42,135
it's no surprise things
would get a bit jumbled.

358
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:45,138
So you feel we're on the right
track with these treatments?

359
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:46,430
Yes, I do,

360
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,933
but I still want
to see you tomorrow.

361
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,691
What's on
your mind, Dax?

362
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:01,487
Oh! I wish I knew what
these hallucinations meant.

363
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,990
The computer's still trying
to identify the music.

364
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,616
Maybe that'll
tell us something.

365
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:06,951
I hope so.

366
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:08,535
Jadzia, um...

367
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,412
maybe you still
have some issues

368
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,832
you need to sort out
about the time you spent here.

369
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:15,584
I don't need
therapy, Julian.

370
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,461
I need answers.

371
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:20,380
Maybe the Guardians
could help me.

372
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,092
The Guardians?
SISKO:
They're unjoined Trill

373
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:24,593
who have devoted
their lives

374
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,928
to the care of
the symbionts.

375
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:28,097
They know more about them
than anyone.

376
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:52,163
BASHIR:
So, this is where
the symbionts breed?

377
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:54,456
DAX:
Mm-hmm. There are
interconnecting pools

378
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,749
throughout
these caves.

379
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,502
They stretch back
for kilometers.

380
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:08,428
Look.
There's two of them
surfacing now.

381
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,185
What was that
energy discharge?

382
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:15,728
That's how
the symbionts

383
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,437
communicate
with each other.

384
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:18,856
Fascinating.

385
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,495
DAX:
That's one
of the Guardians.

386
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,206
Don't be surprised

387
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:37,457
if he seems
a little distracted.

388
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:39,335
They're not used
to visitors.

389
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,217
Hmm, that explain things.

390
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:47,801
Can I ask what
you're doing?

391
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:50,137
Yes.

392
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:54,558
What are you doing?

393
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:59,021
Oh, just making sure
they're comfortable.

394
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:03,067
Checking
the ion concentration,

395
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:05,111
temperature,
viscosity.

396
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:10,448
They get very cranky
if everything's not perfect.

397
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:13,244
You don't want them cranky.

398
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:16,872
Oh, no, huh...
of course not.

399
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,832
They can be
very demanding.

400
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,502
Sometimes...

401
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,838
I don't know why
I put up with it.

402
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,178
What's the weather
like outside?

403
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,763
Well, it's sunny,
very pleasant.

404
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:34,223
Ah, sunshine.

405
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:36,225
I miss sunshine.

406
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:41,147
You're Dax.

407
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,858
Yes.
Jadzia Dax.

408
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,652
How did you know?

409
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,660
I know.

410
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:57,704
Something's wrong.

411
00:24:58,872 --> 00:24:59,957
Yes.

412
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,501
Do you mind?

413
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:09,883
Oh...

414
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,760
Oh, that is not good.

415
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,846
Not good at all.

416
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:17,183
Tell me,
how bad are the dreams?

417
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:18,851
They're not dreams.

418
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,936
They're hallucinations.

419
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:24,106
Actually, they're memories.

420
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:26,608
Then why don't
I remember them?

421
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:30,154
The balance is off.

422
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:32,490
You mean the balance
between host and symbiont.

423
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:35,701
What other balance
is there?

424
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:38,578
Someone's not
playing fair.

425
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:40,373
It wouldn't be Dax,

426
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:42,208
so it must be the host.

427
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:45,461
You're saying the problem
is with Jadzia?

428
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:47,004
No, no, not necessarily.

429
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:49,006
Could be any one of the hosts.

430
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:52,343
GUARDIAN:
All right, Dax.

431
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:53,969
Come with me.

432
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,263
Let's see what we find.

433
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,611
How'd it go?

434
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:14,532
Timor is convinced
that my hallucinations
have something to do

435
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:16,742
with one of my
previous hosts.

436
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:18,536
But he's not sure which one,

437
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:22,081
so he wants me to come back
again tomorrow to see him.

438
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,623
We've got some good news.

439
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:26,001
The computer's identified
your music.

440
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,627
Can I hear it?

441
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:33,467
(<i> melody playing</i> )

442
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:34,968
That's it.

443
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,512
The piece
was written

444
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:39,139
by a Trill named Joran Belar
86 years ago.

445
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:41,434
Does the name
sound familiar?

446
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:43,810
Joran Belar?

447
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,979
I don't think so.

448
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,814
Is there a picture of him?

449
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,108
I'll see.

450
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:22,516
(<i> moaning</i> )

451
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:26,479
He left me no choice.

452
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:28,063
Who are you?!

453
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:43,245
(<i> gasps</i> )

454
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:44,580
Dax?

455
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,747
(<i> gasping</i> )

456
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,500
Dax!

457
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:54,214
She's in
neural shock.

458
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:09,396
RENHOL:
We have to stabilize
her synaptic functions.

459
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,981
Activate the neural
induction field.

460
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,277
Give her another
2cc's

461
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:16,694
of benzocyatizine.

462
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:18,572
Doctor...

463
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:20,740
Her isoboramine levels
are down to 51 percent.

464
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,035
I don't understand it,
a decrease that severe

465
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,245
is usually the result
of tissue damage.

466
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:28,040
Commander, this wormhole
you've discovered--

467
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,125
have your people
done any surveys

468
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,127
of the diametric fields
it generates?

469
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:34,921
Yes, in fact, Dax did the
most recent survey herself.

470
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,549
I'd like to see
those reports.

471
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:38,467
BASHIR:
Do you think there's
any correlation

472
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,594
between Dax's condition
and the wormhole?

473
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:43,013
Something unusual is affecting
her, and at this point,

474
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:45,683
we can't afford
to rule anything out.

475
00:28:45,683 --> 00:28:48,477
If we can't get her
isoboramine readings

476
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:50,896
up to an acceptable level
within 48 hours,

477
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:53,815
I'm afraid we'll have
to remove the symbiont.

478
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,442
But that will
kill Jadzia!

479
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:57,277
I'm well aware
of that, Commander,

480
00:28:57,277 --> 00:29:00,155
but Jadzia would be
the first to tell you

481
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,408
that our primary
responsibility

482
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:04,702
must be to the symbiont.

483
00:29:04,702 --> 00:29:07,746
If there's any change
in her condition,

484
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:08,872
I'll let you know.

485
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:12,042
(<i> sighs</i> )

486
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,670
Timor, we need your help.

487
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,297
Dax has gone
into neural shock.
I'm sorry to hear that.

488
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:18,882
The doctors at the
Symbiosis Commission

489
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,926
don't know
what's causing it.

490
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:24,179
You told Jadzia
that her condition
had something to do

491
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,139
with one of Dax's
previous hosts.

492
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:29,142
That was just
speculation.

493
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:31,729
You told her
you were certain of it.

494
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:34,523
If I gave that
impression,
I apologize.

495
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:37,025
Now, if you gentlemen
will excuse me,

496
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,860
the symbionts need me.

497
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,779
Jadzia needs you, too.

498
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,030
She's dying!

499
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,865
All we're asking
is that you come

500
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,784
with us to the
Symbiosis Commission

501
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,620
and consult
with Dr. Renhol.

502
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:50,247
I'm sorry, there's
nothing I can do.

503
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:52,666
How do you know that
unless you try?

504
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,918
Timor, what's
going on here?

505
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:58,046
Did someone tell you
not to pursue this?

506
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,715
Why would anyone
do that?

507
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:02,175
You tell me.

508
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:04,762
I hope your friend
recovers.

509
00:30:04,762 --> 00:30:06,639
I truly do.

510
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:10,643
Now, if that's all,
I'm very busy.

511
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:13,061
He's not busy,
he's scared.

512
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,563
Why would anyone

513
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:16,315
want to keep him
quiet about this?

514
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:17,691
What are they
trying to hide?

515
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:19,568
Yesterday,
Timor claimed

516
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:20,986
the problem was with one
of Dax's previous hosts.

517
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:22,988
Today, the mere mention
of the possibility

518
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:24,197
makes him nervous.

519
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,741
You'd think that
someone doesn't want

520
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,618
an investigation of
those past hosts.

521
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:29,662
I can't think of a better reason
for such an investigation.

522
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:31,330
Can you?

523
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,915
It's possible that
one of the Dax hosts

524
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:37,085
had something to do
with this composer Belar.

525
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,296
Well, Jadzia seemed
to lose consciousness

526
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:41,632
the minute she saw
Belar's picture.

527
00:30:41,632 --> 00:30:43,717
I think it's time we
found out more about him.

528
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:56,896
I've accessed the Trill
central database.

529
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:59,899
Let's see what information
there is on Joran Belar.

530
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,654
BASHIR:
Here we are.

531
00:31:03,654 --> 00:31:05,781
Born on Stardate 1024.7.

532
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:08,575
Died on Stardate 8615.2.

533
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,536
Is that all there is?

534
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:12,412
Well, I was expecting
a lot more.

535
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:13,997
When I looked through
Dax's records,

536
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:16,375
there was detailed
information on each host.

537
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,084
Could the file
have been purged?

538
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:20,420
If part of the file's
been deleted,

539
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,214
the data compression
ratio might be off.

540
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:23,923
Yeah, look at this.

541
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:26,468
The ratio's for a file
five times larger.

542
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:28,136
There was definitely
more information here.

543
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,722
Call up Dax's records.

544
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:32,224
Put them side by side
with Joran's.

545
00:31:36,854 --> 00:31:38,271
SISKO:
Wait a minute.

546
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,398
Look at these dates.

547
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,650
Belar died on the same day

548
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,652
as Torias Dax died.

549
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:47,113
The same day the Dax symbiont
was put into Curzon.

550
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:49,575
Oh, this has to be more
than a coincidence.

551
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,495
Whoever purged
the main database

552
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:55,163
might have missed
something.

553
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,667
Check the
enrollment records

554
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,836
of all the Trill
music academies

555
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:02,462
during Belar's lifetime.

556
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,883
He's not listed.

557
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:08,009
But there is someone here
with the same last name.

558
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:10,679
Maybe they're related.
Yolad Belar.

559
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,723
Check the central database.

560
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:14,600
See if he's still alive.

561
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,395
He is.

562
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:20,939
Access the Trill
communications grid.
Try to locate him.

563
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:25,151
There's a reasonable chance
that he and Joran were related.

564
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:27,571
Musical ability
often runs in families.

565
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,074
I've established a com link.

566
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,076
Put him on the main viewer.

567
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:40,166
Yes, can I help you?

568
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,710
I'm Commander Benjamin Sisko

569
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,421
of the Federation Starbase
Deep Space 9.

570
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:49,509
What would a Starfleet
officer want with me?

571
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,303
Are you Yolad Belar?

572
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,346
I am. Why?

573
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:56,642
We're trying to find information
on a man named Joran Belar.

574
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:57,893
Do you know him?

575
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:00,938
Of course I did.
He was my brother.

576
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:04,232
He was a composer?

577
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,692
That's right.

578
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,986
We both graduated
from the same music academy.

579
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,613
Are you aware that his record

580
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:12,282
has been purged from
the academy's files?

581
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:14,993
That doesn't make any sense.

582
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,954
What's this all about?

583
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:19,623
That's what we're trying
to find out.

584
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:22,584
Do you know if your brother
knew a joined Trill

585
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:24,169
named Torias Dax?

586
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:28,590
My brother died 85 years ago.

587
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,343
I, I have a hard time
remembering

588
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,094
what happened yesterday.

589
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,722
Then you don't remember
the name?

590
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:40,101
No. But that doesn't mean
Joran didn't know him.

591
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,979
You say he was joined.

592
00:33:41,979 --> 00:33:43,772
They could have met

593
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:47,484
when my brother went off
to become an initiate.

594
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:49,611
He was a candidate
for joining?

595
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:52,489
That's what I just said,
isn't it?

596
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:54,115
Was he given a symbiont?

597
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:57,870
Not according
to the Symbiosis Commission.

598
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:01,039
They claim he was dropped
from the program

599
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,916
after the second year.

600
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:06,336
According to them,
he murdered the doctor

601
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:08,797
that recommended
dropping him,

602
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:12,342
and was killed trying
to escape the murder scene.

603
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:15,345
Sounds like you're not convinced
that's what really happened.

604
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:19,725
Oh, I believe
he killed that doctor.

605
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:23,812
My brother
had a violent temper.

606
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:28,149
But about six months
before that happened,

607
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,485
my brother contacted me.

608
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:33,613
He sounded different somehow,

609
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:36,950
more confident,
even colder than usual,

610
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:40,495
and when I asked him
about it, he laughed.

611
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:46,251
He said he<i> was</i> different,
that he'd been joined.

612
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:48,503
Did he tell you the name
of his symbiont?

613
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:51,339
Hmm...
maybe he did.

614
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:56,219
I was so surprised to learn
he'd been chosen to be joined,

615
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,597
I can't remember much else.

616
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,933
I loved my brother, Commander.

617
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:05,896
In spite of all the things
he did, I loved him.

618
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:10,650
Thank you for taking the time
to speak with us.

619
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:16,114
Doctor, call up Dax's records.

620
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,283
I think I'm beginning
to understand

621
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,910
what's going on here.

622
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:30,045
According to the
official records,

623
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:33,673
after Torias died, the Dax
symbiont was put into Curzon.

624
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,675
What if that's not
what happened?

625
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:38,929
What if Dax was given
another host before Curzon--

626
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:43,934
a host who should never
have been given a symbiont?

627
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:47,353
A host named Joran Belar.

628
00:35:58,073 --> 00:36:00,993
Her isoboramine levels
have dropped to 44 percent.

629
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:04,329
Tell Dr. Torvin to prepare
the new host for surgery.

630
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:07,666
We'll begin transferring
the symbiont in 15 minutes.

631
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,375
SISKO:
Tell Dr. Torvin

632
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:12,211
to get a cup of<i> raktajino.</i> 
He won't be needed.

633
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:13,755
Commander Sisko, how dare you
come in here and...

634
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:14,965
BASHIR:
It's over, Doctor.

635
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:17,050
We know about
Joran Belar.

636
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:21,387
Wait outside.
Tell the surgeons to stand by.

637
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,391
I don't have time for this,
Commander.

638
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,185
The symbiont is in danger.

639
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,227
So is Jadzia.

640
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:31,148
I can't do
anything for her.

641
00:36:31,148 --> 00:36:33,817
Can't or won't?

642
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:36,235
I resent that implication.

643
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:38,321
And I resent having to watch
my friend die

644
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,657
just so you can protect
your secret.

645
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:41,783
What secret?

646
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:43,827
Oh, I think
you know.

647
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:45,244
And the thought of it
becoming public

648
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:46,872
scares the hell out of you.

649
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:48,581
Commander, I don't know
what you're talking about.

650
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,083
I'm talking
about the fact

651
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:52,377
that, 86 years ago,
the Symbiosis Commission

652
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:55,338
mistakenly gave the Dax
symbiont to Joran Belar.

653
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,883
I don't recall
ever seeing any mention

654
00:36:57,883 --> 00:37:00,052
of a Joran Dax on our records.

655
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:01,928
And we both know why, Doctor.

656
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:04,472
The Symbiosis Commission
altered the records

657
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,099
just like they tried

658
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:08,185
to erase all knowledge
of Joran from Dax's memory.

659
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:09,728
And now,
after 80 years,

660
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,897
the memory block
is deteriorating,

661
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:14,900
and Dax is starting to
remember the Joran host.

662
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,276
What possible reason
would anyone have

663
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:20,113
to create that sort
of elaborate cover-up?

664
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:21,823
We wondered
about that, too.

665
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:23,408
What was it about Joran

666
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,744
that had to be hidden
at all costs?

667
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,120
The fact that he never

668
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,082
should have been selected
as a host? No.

669
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:33,043
That simple error in judgment
wouldn't be enough, would it?

670
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:34,669
There had to be something more.

671
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,088
Something that
would shake

672
00:37:36,088 --> 00:37:38,381
the very foundation
of your society.

673
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,592
Tell me, Doctor,
how many of your people

674
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:42,177
are suitable for joining?

675
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:44,387
I don't see
how that's relevant.

676
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,973
I understand
the percentage
is very low--

677
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,767
maybe one in a thousand?

678
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:49,935
That's right.

679
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:51,770
Which is why the candidates

680
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,855
are put through such
rigorous testing.

681
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:56,108
That's how we make sure
the symbionts

682
00:37:56,108 --> 00:37:58,151
aren't given
to an unsuitable host.

683
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:00,403
What would happen
if, for some reason,

684
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,488
a symbiont was given
to an unsuitable host?

685
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,118
That doesn't happen.

686
00:38:06,118 --> 00:38:07,452
What if it did?

687
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:09,121
Rejection would set in.

688
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:11,831
The host and the symbiont
would both die.

689
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,666
How long before rejection
would set in?

690
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:17,087
Three, maybe four days.

691
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:18,880
Then someone like Joran Belar,

692
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,841
an unstable personality
with violent tendencies,

693
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,427
should have rejected a symbiont
within a matter of days.

694
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,179
Yet that didn't happen,
did it?

695
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:27,472
According to
our information,

696
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:29,182
he was joined to
the Dax symbiont

697
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:30,642
for six months.

698
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:34,187
Six months, Doctor.

699
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:35,897
If a man like Joran Belar

700
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:38,399
can be joined successfully
for that long,

701
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,777
how many others
can be joined as well?

702
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:43,280
Hundreds? Thousands?

703
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,448
Certainly more
than the Symbiosis Commission

704
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:46,741
would have us believe,

705
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,576
and that is what
you've been trying

706
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,453
to cover up all along,
isn't it?

707
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:53,748
That's why you're willing
to let Jadzia die!

708
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:03,008
I'm not interested in exposing
your secret, Doctor.

709
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:07,095
All I care about is Jadzia.

710
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:10,932
And I promise you,
if she dies,

711
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:14,811
I'll see to it that
the entire planet knows why.

712
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:22,944
Do you realize what would happen
if you did that?

713
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:24,904
It would mean chaos.

714
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:27,991
There aren't enough symbionts
for that many hosts.

715
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:29,242
The potential danger

716
00:39:29,242 --> 00:39:31,786
to the symbionts
would be enormous.

717
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:35,290
They would become commodities
to be purchased,

718
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:38,335
or prizes to be fought over.

719
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:42,547
Nearly half our population
is capable of being joined.

720
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:48,887
That's what we learned
from our unfortunate experience

721
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:51,306
with Joran Dax.

722
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:59,022
Now do you understand why you
must not reveal the truth?

723
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:02,108
Do<i> you</i> understand my terms?

724
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:04,402
It's not
that simple.

725
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,945
For Jadzia to survive,

726
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,990
we have to stabilize
the synaptic functions

727
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,201
between the host and symbiont.

728
00:40:11,201 --> 00:40:14,495
Joran's memories have
to be allowed to surface

729
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:17,165
to reintegrate with
Dax's other memories.

730
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:19,251
It could be
very dangerous.

731
00:40:19,251 --> 00:40:20,752
Jadzia is a
strong woman.

732
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,587
I say we give
her that chance.

733
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:24,547
What if you're wrong?

734
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:28,467
What if Joran's personality
overwhelms Jadzia?

735
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:30,636
Are you willing
to risk that?

736
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:32,347
The point is

737
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:34,432
it's not up to me
or you to decide.

738
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,227
It's<i> her</i> life
and<i> her</i> decision.

We've got a lot to
talk about, Jadzia.

742
00:41:02,294 --> 00:41:05,046
You have a
decision to make.

743
00:42:11,154 --> 00:42:13,031
Joran.

744
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,824
You know who I am.

745
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:17,994
You're a part of me.

746
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,793
(<i> door chimes</i> )

747
00:43:09,546 --> 00:43:10,755
Come in.

748
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:20,390
Checking up on me, Benjamin?

749
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:22,434
Just thought I'd see
how you were doing.

750
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:29,857
Julian stopped by 15 minutes ago
and said the same thing.

751
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,652
I'll be all right.

752
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:37,449
I just need some time
to sort things out.

753
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:39,700
I suppose it would
have been easier

754
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,994
if you'd never
found out about Joran.

755
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:45,081
No, I'm glad I did.

756
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:47,333
If you want to know
who you are,

757
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:50,044
it's important to know
who you've been.

758

Good night, old man.

759
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,305
Benjamin.
