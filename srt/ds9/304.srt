1
00:00:06,141 --> 00:00:08,477
I don't know about you,
but I'm starving.

2
00:00:08,514 --> 00:00:09,483
Me, too.

3
00:00:09,516 --> 00:00:10,849
Here you go.
Enjoy.

4
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:12,185
Thanks.

5
00:00:12,224 --> 00:00:13,557
This looks delicious.

6
00:00:15,565 --> 00:00:17,695
Now, Constable,
the secret of a good soufflé

7
00:00:17,737 --> 00:00:18,933
is consistency.

8
00:00:18,974 --> 00:00:21,674
You have to be careful
not to overwhip it.

9
00:00:21,715 --> 00:00:23,207
I see.

10
00:00:23,285 --> 00:00:25,519
I hope I'm not boring you.

11
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:28,326
Just because I don't
need food, Commander

12
00:00:28,365 --> 00:00:31,567
doesn't mean I'm not interested
in its preparation.

13
00:00:31,606 --> 00:00:35,709
I'm fascinated by the humanoid
preoccupation with eating.

14
00:00:36,821 --> 00:00:38,085
Oh, uh, may I?

15
00:00:38,124 --> 00:00:39,252
By all means.

16
00:00:39,294 --> 00:00:41,265
Ow.

17
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,674
Ah...

18
00:00:47,983 --> 00:00:49,647
Uh, nice and smooth.

19
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:52,385
That's it.

20
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:53,829
It's all in the wrist.

21
00:00:56,338 --> 00:00:57,637
Where did you learn all this?

22
00:00:57,674 --> 00:01:00,169
In my father's restaurant
in New Orleans.

23
00:01:00,214 --> 00:01:01,376
What are we having?

24
00:01:01,418 --> 00:01:02,682
It smells delicious.

25
00:01:02,721 --> 00:01:03,712
Blackened red fish

26
00:01:03,757 --> 00:01:05,991
with creamed spinach
and sautéed beets.

27
00:01:06,029 --> 00:01:07,966
Beets?

28
00:01:08,002 --> 00:01:10,201
You don't like beets, Doctor?

29
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,040
Well, they're not exactly

30
00:01:12,078 --> 00:01:14,607
a, a personal favorite
of mine, no.

31
00:01:14,652 --> 00:01:17,490
That's because you haven't
had them prepared properly.

32
00:01:19,498 --> 00:01:23,406
Beets are a very
misunderstood vegetable.

33
00:01:23,441 --> 00:01:26,974
Well, I look forward
to understanding it better.

34
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,350
Come in.

35
00:01:31,362 --> 00:01:32,422
Oh, what a day.

36
00:01:32,465 --> 00:01:34,903
I just spent six hours
in one of the upper pylons

37
00:01:34,938 --> 00:01:37,102
trying to get the new
sensor relay on line.

38
00:01:37,143 --> 00:01:38,841
Help yourself to something.

39
00:01:38,882 --> 00:01:40,512
Dinner will be ready
in a few minutes.

40
00:01:40,553 --> 00:01:41,817
Great.

41
00:01:41,856 --> 00:01:44,522
I've been looking forward
to this all day.

42
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,363
I hope you like beets.

43
00:01:46,468 --> 00:01:48,804
I love 'em.

44
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:50,641
Keep at it, Constable.

45
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:52,309
Nice, even strokes.

46
00:01:57,062 --> 00:01:59,398
You find something amusing,
Major?

47
00:01:59,435 --> 00:02:02,432
Oh, I just think you look so...

48
00:02:02,476 --> 00:02:04,379
cute, I...

49
00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:16,005
Whose is this?

50
00:02:16,044 --> 00:02:17,878
It's mine.

51
00:02:19,186 --> 00:02:20,712
I didn't know that you played.

52
00:02:20,757 --> 00:02:22,249
I don't.

53
00:02:22,294 --> 00:02:24,128
I took lessons for a while

54
00:02:24,165 --> 00:02:25,897
but, uh, I wasn't very good.

55
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,999
Oh, I know the feeling.

56
00:02:29,178 --> 00:02:31,377
None of Dax's hosts...
even Jadzia...

57
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:32,978
had any musical ability.

58
00:02:33,022 --> 00:02:34,993
Nobody said life was fair.

59
00:02:35,028 --> 00:02:37,432
Even if you had seven of them.

60
00:02:37,467 --> 00:02:39,301
You would think one of us

61
00:02:39,339 --> 00:02:42,279
would have been born
without a tin ear.

62
00:02:42,312 --> 00:02:45,445
Sounds like one of you
had some talent after all.

63
00:02:50,267 --> 00:02:51,429
That's lovely.

64
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,461
Quiet!

65
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:12,583
That's not it!

66
00:03:15,532 --> 00:03:17,594
What piece was that?

67
00:03:17,638 --> 00:03:18,971
I don't know.

68
00:03:19,008 --> 00:03:21,002
I don't believe
I've ever heard it before.

69
00:03:21,046 --> 00:03:23,484
Maybe you hit
on it by accident.

70
00:03:23,586 --> 00:03:25,785
You know, beginner's luck.

71
00:03:28,332 --> 00:03:30,861
But I know it somehow.

72
00:03:30,906 --> 00:03:33,880
It's probably something
from your childhood.

73
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:34,905
You'll think of it.

74
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:36,579
Dinner is ready.

75
00:05:52,156 --> 00:05:54,184
Do you mind?

76
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,356
What?

77
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:56,458
You're humming.

78
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,403
It's a little distracting.

79
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,883
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
I was doing it.

80
00:06:02,917 --> 00:06:04,945
You've been humming
that same tune

81
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,153
since we started the game.

82
00:06:07,195 --> 00:06:09,325
Guess I just can't get it
out of my mind.

83
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,373
Do me a favor...

84
00:06:13,445 --> 00:06:15,348
try.

85
00:06:38,442 --> 00:06:39,741
Your turn.

86
00:06:45,394 --> 00:06:47,388
You sure you want to do that?

87
00:06:47,433 --> 00:06:49,597
Your move.

88
00:06:53,982 --> 00:06:55,110
Check.

89
00:06:55,219 --> 00:06:58,318
Where did that knight come from?

90
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,060
Your mind is not on the game.

91
00:07:01,168 --> 00:07:03,766
So you decided to make
an illegal move

92
00:07:03,808 --> 00:07:05,243
to get my attention.

93
00:07:05,278 --> 00:07:06,542
Of course not

94
00:07:06,582 --> 00:07:08,781
and it's a legal move.

95
00:07:08,821 --> 00:07:11,453
You know, why don't
we just call it a day?

96
00:07:11,495 --> 00:07:14,367
You obviously have other things
on your mind.

97
00:07:14,402 --> 00:07:18,505
Curzon always suspected
you were a cheat.

98
00:07:18,547 --> 00:07:21,385
Is this some kind of joke?

99
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,858
Don't play innocent
with me, Benjamin.

100
00:07:23,894 --> 00:07:26,696
We both know you're trying
to cheat me here

101
00:07:26,735 --> 00:07:28,831
so why don't you just admit it?

102
00:07:42,107 --> 00:07:44,375
Dax.

103
00:07:44,414 --> 00:07:48,186
Did Sisko send you
to apologize for him?

104
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,816
No.

105
00:07:52,902 --> 00:07:55,808
But he was concerned
about what happened.

106
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:59,615
I thought you might like
to talk about it.

107
00:07:59,653 --> 00:08:01,989
There's nothing to talk about.

108
00:08:02,026 --> 00:08:04,932
You can't really think
he tried to cheat you.

109
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:06,835
I knew you'd take his side.

110
00:08:06,872 --> 00:08:09,401
I'm not taking anybody's side.

111
00:08:09,445 --> 00:08:13,080
In that case, I think
you should leave, Kira.

112
00:08:13,122 --> 00:08:15,286
Dax.

113
00:08:15,327 --> 00:08:19,064
I'm serious.
Leave.

114
00:08:22,846 --> 00:08:24,783
Fine, I'll go.

115
00:08:24,818 --> 00:08:26,914
Wait...

116
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,054
Get your hands off of me

117
00:08:29,096 --> 00:08:32,298
before I do something
I'll regret.

118
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:39,681
That's the first smart
thing you've done

119
00:08:39,724 --> 00:08:41,456
since you walked over here.

120
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:49,263
Oh!

121
00:09:50,675 --> 00:09:52,543
Something wrong, Lieutenant?

122
00:09:54,618 --> 00:09:56,053
No...

123
00:09:56,088 --> 00:09:57,557
no.

124
00:10:17,678 --> 00:10:19,706
How do you feel?

125
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,390
I feel like an idiot.

126
00:10:24,997 --> 00:10:27,869
I'm so sorry about
all the horrible things

127
00:10:27,904 --> 00:10:29,464
I said to you.

128
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:31,172
Don't worry about it.

129
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:33,309
They're already forgotten.

130
00:10:33,352 --> 00:10:36,052
And I used to think
Curzon had a temper.

131
00:10:40,604 --> 00:10:43,133
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

132
00:10:43,177 --> 00:10:46,447
I feel like I have
so much anger inside

133
00:10:46,486 --> 00:10:48,184
and I don't know
where it's coming from.

134
00:10:48,224 --> 00:10:51,859
This masked figure in your...

135
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,700
Hallucinations.

136
00:10:53,738 --> 00:10:56,871
Do you have the sense
of who it might have been?

137
00:10:56,913 --> 00:10:58,816
That's what's so strange.

138
00:10:58,851 --> 00:11:03,022
He seems familiar, somehow,
but I don't know from where.

139
00:11:04,466 --> 00:11:07,234
And the music.

140
00:11:07,273 --> 00:11:10,111
Benjamin, I have to find out
what that music is.

141
00:11:10,148 --> 00:11:11,139
Why don't you input

142
00:11:11,183 --> 00:11:13,347
as much as you can
remember in the computer.

143
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:17,993
It might be able to find a match
in the Federation database.

144
00:11:18,034 --> 00:11:19,664
I'll do it...

145
00:11:19,706 --> 00:11:22,372
Well, as soon as Julian
lets me leave here.

146
00:11:22,413 --> 00:11:23,712
Jadzia...

147
00:11:25,721 --> 00:11:29,219
have you experienced any
hallucinations prior to this?

148
00:11:29,264 --> 00:11:32,032
Never, and I hope
I never do again.

149
00:11:32,071 --> 00:11:33,540
It was terrifying.

150
00:11:33,575 --> 00:11:35,671
Have any of Dax's other hosts?

151
00:11:35,713 --> 00:11:38,778
No, believe me, I'd remember.

152
00:11:38,822 --> 00:11:40,052
Well...

153
00:11:40,091 --> 00:11:41,424
according to your file

154
00:11:41,463 --> 00:11:44,733
the only major trauma
the Dax symbiont ever suffered

155
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:48,109
was when Torias Dax was injured
in a shuttle accident.

156
00:11:48,146 --> 00:11:49,274
Torias...

157
00:11:49,316 --> 00:11:51,618
he was Dax's fifth host,
wasn't he?

158
00:11:51,722 --> 00:11:53,386
Yes, right before Curzon.

159
00:11:53,427 --> 00:11:57,632
It says here that Torias
remained in a comatose state

160
00:11:57,704 --> 00:11:59,504
for just under six months.

161
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:01,445
There must have been
a lot of tissue damage.

162
00:12:01,481 --> 00:12:03,554
The doctors couldn't keep
his isoboramine levels up.

163
00:12:03,687 --> 00:12:05,487
Isoboramine?

164
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:06,653
It's a neurotransmitter

165
00:12:06,695 --> 00:12:08,825
that mediates
the synaptic functions

166
00:12:08,867 --> 00:12:11,807
between the host
and the symbiont.

167
00:12:11,842 --> 00:12:14,782
When the levels dropped
to below 40 percent of normal

168
00:12:14,816 --> 00:12:16,844
they had to remove the symbiont.

169
00:12:16,888 --> 00:12:21,264
Sometimes the host is sacrificed
to save the symbiont.

170
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:23,794
Are you checking
my isoboramine levels?

171
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,138
Yes.

172
00:12:25,176 --> 00:12:27,648
How low are they?

173
00:12:27,683 --> 00:12:30,555
They've fallen
to 73 percent of normal.

174
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,119
Do you have any idea
what's causing it?

175
00:12:33,164 --> 00:12:35,226
I'm not sure.

176
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,538
There's no tissue damage.

177
00:12:37,575 --> 00:12:39,512
No synaptic degradation.

178
00:12:41,151 --> 00:12:46,119
Julian... am I in danger
of rejecting my symbiont?

179
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,999
I wouldn't worry
about rejection just yet

180
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:53,482
but we do have to get
your isoboramine levels back up.

181
00:12:53,517 --> 00:12:55,351
And I suggest we take her back

182
00:12:55,388 --> 00:12:57,188
to the Trill homeworld,
and have the doctors

183
00:12:57,227 --> 00:12:59,529
at the Symbiosis Commission
examine her.

184
00:13:09,124 --> 00:13:10,423
Curzon always said

185
00:13:10,461 --> 00:13:13,229
he wanted to show me
the Trill homeworld.

186
00:13:13,268 --> 00:13:16,333
Looks like I'm going
to get there after all.

187
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,411
How long before we reach Trill?

188
00:13:30,446 --> 00:13:31,938
A little over 37 hours.

189
00:13:31,983 --> 00:13:33,145
How's Dax?

190
00:13:33,186 --> 00:13:34,918
Resting in her quarters.

191
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,484
Hmm.

192
00:13:36,528 --> 00:13:38,088
It's funny.

193
00:13:38,132 --> 00:13:41,504
It's been almost four years
since Curzon died

194
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,775
and I still miss the old man.

195
00:13:43,814 --> 00:13:47,654
At first, I never thought
I'd ever get used to a new Dax

196
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:50,162
but if anything happens
to Jadzia...

197
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:51,723
I know.

198
00:13:52,603 --> 00:13:54,095
I feel the same way.

199
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:58,014
We'll just have to make sure
nothing happens to her, right?

200
00:13:58,051 --> 00:14:00,319
Right.

201
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,282
Yes?

202
00:14:15,863 --> 00:14:17,561
Oh, good, I didn't wake you.

203
00:14:19,406 --> 00:14:20,568
Not at all.

204
00:14:20,676 --> 00:14:22,806
You having trouble sleeping?

205
00:14:22,848 --> 00:14:24,842
Yeah, a little.

206
00:14:26,524 --> 00:14:28,222
I could get you something.

207
00:14:28,262 --> 00:14:29,492
No, thanks

208
00:14:29,532 --> 00:14:31,503
but I could use some company...

209
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,029
if you're not too busy.

210
00:14:33,075 --> 00:14:34,601
Oh, no, no,
I was just reading.

211
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:37,049
Oh, anything I'd be
interested in?

212
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,893
<i>Trill Physiology.</i>

213
00:14:40,928 --> 00:14:43,024
Just some background research.

214
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:50,783
Look, um, Jadzia,
I know you're worried

215
00:14:50,821 --> 00:14:53,157
but the doctors
at the Symbiosis Commission

216
00:14:53,194 --> 00:14:55,462
know a lot more about this
than I do.

217
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,972
I can't believe
I'm going back there.

218
00:14:58,007 --> 00:15:00,639
I spent three years
as a Trill initiate

219
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:05,351
and in all that time,
I hardly ever left the complex.

220
00:15:05,392 --> 00:15:06,452
After I was joined

221
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:09,297
I swore I would never
step foot in there again.

222
00:15:09,336 --> 00:15:11,808
Was it really that bad?

223
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:14,778
No.

224
00:15:14,816 --> 00:15:18,656
What I remember is
the endless series of tests

225
00:15:18,727 --> 00:15:20,162
they put me through.

226
00:15:20,197 --> 00:15:22,396
Well, considering the risk
of rejection

227
00:15:22,437 --> 00:15:23,906
you can't really blame them.

228
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,412
If they would have put a
symbiont in an unsuitable host

229
00:15:26,447 --> 00:15:28,441
they'd both be dead
within a matter of days.

230
00:15:29,455 --> 00:15:31,585
That's true.

231
00:15:31,627 --> 00:15:35,866
I guess I had such
a difficult time, because...

232
00:15:35,905 --> 00:15:39,540
I put so much pressure
on myself.

233
00:15:39,581 --> 00:15:41,951
I wanted to be joined so badly.

234
00:15:41,987 --> 00:15:43,685
Well, look on the bright side.

235
00:15:43,725 --> 00:15:46,163
At least this time, you won't
be going there as an initiate.

236
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:47,167
No, I'm going there

237
00:15:47,201 --> 00:15:51,166
as a patient,
and that's much worse.

238
00:15:51,212 --> 00:15:54,745
I never told you this
before, Julian

239
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,757
but...

240
00:15:56,825 --> 00:15:59,161
I've always been
afraid of doctors.

241
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:01,362
Most people are.

242
00:16:01,404 --> 00:16:03,272
When I was younger,
I was terrified of them.

243
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:04,676
Really?

244
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,273
Well, they seemed
to know everything.

245
00:16:06,317 --> 00:16:07,286
It was as if they held

246
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:09,187
the power of life and death
in their hands.

247
00:16:09,224 --> 00:16:11,822
I used to think
that if I didn't behave

248
00:16:11,864 --> 00:16:14,234
they'd make sure I got sick.

249
00:16:14,271 --> 00:16:16,709
Then, as I got older,
I decided

250
00:16:16,744 --> 00:16:19,877
that I wanted to know
what they knew...

251
00:16:19,918 --> 00:16:22,048
be as smart as they were.

252
00:16:22,091 --> 00:16:24,563
And that's why you went
to medical school.

253
00:16:24,598 --> 00:16:25,726
That's right.

254
00:16:25,768 --> 00:16:28,936
And you know
what I learned there?

255
00:16:28,976 --> 00:16:32,543
That all I really wanted
to do was help people.

256
00:16:32,585 --> 00:16:35,787
That's what doctors
are there for... to help

257
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:39,700
so there's really no reason
to be afraid of them.

258
00:16:40,973 --> 00:16:43,377
Now, if that little story

259
00:16:43,413 --> 00:16:47,287
didn't put you to sleep,
I don't know what will.

260
00:16:47,323 --> 00:16:50,456
You're a very dear man, Julian.

261
00:16:54,007 --> 00:16:55,533
Listen, Jadzia...

262
00:16:55,578 --> 00:16:59,543
you are more than welcome to
stay the night here if you want.

263
00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:01,355
You can have the top bunk.

264
00:17:03,766 --> 00:17:05,703
Are you sure you don't mind?

265
00:17:05,738 --> 00:17:06,968
Absolutely not.

266
00:17:07,008 --> 00:17:08,170
Up you go.

267
00:17:09,648 --> 00:17:13,181
Okay... well, in that case,
if it's not too much trouble

268
00:17:13,224 --> 00:17:15,218
would you mind if I
took the lower bunk?

269
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,200
Curzon fell out
of a tree once and...

270
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:19,805
Whatever you want.

271
00:17:19,841 --> 00:17:21,675
Thank you.

272
00:17:40,661 --> 00:17:43,190
Is this light
too bright for you?

273
00:17:45,942 --> 00:17:47,241
Dax?

274
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,918
Sweet dreams.

275
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,221
After they finally finished
the neuro-response analysis

276
00:18:04,256 --> 00:18:05,691
another doctor came in

277
00:18:05,726 --> 00:18:08,028
and ran a cortical
protein series.

278
00:18:08,066 --> 00:18:11,040
Did they do a bio-spectral scan
on the symbiont?

279
00:18:11,074 --> 00:18:12,134
They had to make an incision

280
00:18:12,177 --> 00:18:13,544
so they could
insert the scanner.

281
00:18:17,524 --> 00:18:19,860
Jadzia, it's good
to see you again.

282
00:18:19,897 --> 00:18:21,457
Dr. Renhol.

283
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:24,065
Everyone's very excited
about your being here, you know.

284
00:18:24,108 --> 00:18:27,845
Jadzia is the only initiate
to ever successfully reapply

285
00:18:27,884 --> 00:18:30,288
to the program
after being dropped.

286
00:18:30,324 --> 00:18:31,884
You must be Dr. Bashir.

287
00:18:31,928 --> 00:18:33,124
That's right.

288
00:18:33,164 --> 00:18:35,226
Commander Benjamin Sisko.

289
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,637
Ah, yes,
Curzon's friend.

290
00:18:36,674 --> 00:18:38,304
Yes, I had that privilege.

291
00:18:38,344 --> 00:18:40,508
Did you get a chance to look
over the test results?

292
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,678
Yes, I did.

293
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,287
As you noted, Doctor, her
isoboramine levels are low

294
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:48,532
so I put her on a benzocyatic
regimen to compensate.

295
00:18:48,571 --> 00:18:51,203
As you can see, there's already
a three percent improvement.

296
00:18:51,245 --> 00:18:55,153
Will I have to stay here for
the duration of the treatment?

297
00:18:55,188 --> 00:18:57,250
No, Dr. Bashir
can administer it.

298
00:18:57,294 --> 00:18:58,854
But I do want to see
you back here tomorrow

299
00:18:58,898 --> 00:19:00,026
for a follow-up...

300
00:19:00,101 --> 00:19:00,838
and for lunch.

301
00:19:00,972 --> 00:19:02,271
I'd like that.

302
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:05,442
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I have an initiate

303
00:19:05,484 --> 00:19:07,752
who needs some hand-holding.

304
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,385
I don't know
why we came back here

305
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,015
when I could be
taking you on a tour

306
00:19:21,058 --> 00:19:22,254
of the Tenaran ice cliffs.

307
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:23,820
You're not taking us
anywhere, Dax.

308
00:19:23,864 --> 00:19:25,767
You're going straight
to your quarters to rest.

309
00:19:25,803 --> 00:19:26,772
But...

310
00:19:26,806 --> 00:19:28,275
No buts.
Doctor's orders.

311
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:30,975
But I cannot sleep
in the afternoon.

312
00:19:31,017 --> 00:19:34,982
Just lie down, close your eyes
and try not to think.

313
00:19:35,027 --> 00:19:36,861
It usually works for me.

314
00:20:04,938 --> 00:20:07,536
Who are you?

315
00:20:07,578 --> 00:20:10,848
It's beautiful... isn't it?

316
00:20:24,121 --> 00:20:25,681
Dax!

317
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,628
Jadzia!

318
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,469
I don't understand

319
00:20:55,503 --> 00:20:57,201
why she'd have
another hallucination.

320
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,709
I've checked
her isoboramine levels.

321
00:20:58,744 --> 00:21:00,145
They've risen
another six percent.

322
00:21:00,181 --> 00:21:03,280
That's a larger increase
than I'd anticipated.

323
00:21:03,323 --> 00:21:04,553
The suddenness could be

324
00:21:04,593 --> 00:21:06,427
what triggered
the hallucination.

325
00:21:06,464 --> 00:21:08,766
I want you
to begin administering

326
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:12,003
more frequent treatments
at a lower dosage.

327
00:21:12,045 --> 00:21:13,241
Doctor...

328
00:21:15,153 --> 00:21:16,953
the people who attacked me...

329
00:21:16,992 --> 00:21:18,895
they were from
the Symbiosis Commission.

330
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:22,531
Hallucinations often take
the form of latent anxieties

331
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:24,237
and we all know the time
you spent here

332
00:21:24,278 --> 00:21:25,804
wasn't that easy for you.

333
00:21:25,848 --> 00:21:27,978
But the uniforms
they were wearing...

334
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:30,185
they were from
over 100 years ago.

335
00:21:30,226 --> 00:21:32,960
That was long before
Jadzia was an initiate.

336
00:21:32,999 --> 00:21:34,400
And none of my other hosts

337
00:21:34,437 --> 00:21:36,374
had any bad memories
of being here.

338
00:21:36,409 --> 00:21:38,745
Well, with seven lifetimes'
worth of memories

339
00:21:38,782 --> 00:21:41,813
it's no surprise things
would get a bit jumbled.

340
00:21:41,856 --> 00:21:44,853
So you feel we're on the right
track with these treatments?

341
00:21:44,964 --> 00:21:46,160
Yes, I do

342
00:21:46,201 --> 00:21:48,730
but I still want
to see you tomorrow.

343
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:57,395
What's on your mind, Dax?

344
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:01,133
Oh! I wish I knew what
these hallucinations meant.

345
00:22:01,172 --> 00:22:03,838
The computer's still trying
to identify the music.

346
00:22:03,913 --> 00:22:05,439
Maybe that'll
tell us something.

347
00:22:05,484 --> 00:22:06,748
I hope so.

348
00:22:06,787 --> 00:22:08,485
Jadzia, um...

349
00:22:08,525 --> 00:22:10,189
maybe you still have some issues

350
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,862
you need to sort out
about the time you spent here.

351
00:22:12,903 --> 00:22:15,432
I don't need therapy, Julian.

352
00:22:15,476 --> 00:22:17,174
I need answers.

353
00:22:17,214 --> 00:22:20,211
Maybe the Guardians
could help me.

354
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:21,282
The Guardians?

355
00:22:21,325 --> 00:22:23,091
They're unjoined Trill

356
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:25,762
who have devoted their lives
to the care of the symbionts.

357
00:22:25,804 --> 00:22:28,038
They know more about them
than anyone.

358
00:22:49,097 --> 00:22:53,062
So, this is where
the symbionts breed?

359
00:22:53,107 --> 00:22:55,443
Mm-hmm. There are
interconnecting pools

360
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,881
throughout these caves.

361
00:22:56,918 --> 00:22:58,718
They stretch back
for kilometers.

362
00:23:04,169 --> 00:23:05,433
Look.

363
00:23:06,643 --> 00:23:08,477
There's two of them
surfacing now.

364
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,394
What was that energy discharge?

365
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:17,700
That's how the symbionts
communicate with each other.

366
00:23:17,738 --> 00:23:19,002
Fascinating.

367
00:23:31,774 --> 00:23:33,802
That's one of the Guardians.

368
00:23:33,847 --> 00:23:37,584
Don't be surprised
if he seems a little distracted.

369
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,618
They're not used to visitors.

370
00:23:43,906 --> 00:23:46,538
Hmm, that explain things.

371
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,210
Can I ask what you're doing?

372
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,482
Yes.

373
00:23:53,564 --> 00:23:54,760
What are you doing?

374
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:59,074
Oh, just making sure
they're comfortable.

375
00:23:59,112 --> 00:24:05,357
Checking the ion concentration,
temperature, viscosity...

376
00:24:05,395 --> 00:24:10,568
They get very cranky
if everything's not perfect.

377
00:24:10,608 --> 00:24:13,514
You don't want them cranky.

378
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:16,045
Oh, no, huh... of course not.

379
00:24:16,156 --> 00:24:18,492
They can be very demanding.

380
00:24:20,534 --> 00:24:22,630
Sometimes...

381
00:24:22,674 --> 00:24:25,238
I don't know
why I put up with it.

382
00:24:29,491 --> 00:24:31,394
What's the weather like outside?

383
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,025
Well, it's sunny, very pleasant.

384
00:24:33,067 --> 00:24:34,559
Ah, sunshine.

385
00:24:34,605 --> 00:24:36,576
I miss sunshine.

386
00:24:40,453 --> 00:24:41,513
You're Dax.

387
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:44,019
Yes.

388
00:24:44,062 --> 00:24:45,122
Jadzia Dax.

389
00:24:45,165 --> 00:24:46,931
How did you know?

390
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:54,953
I know.

391
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:57,989
Something's wrong.

392
00:24:59,202 --> 00:25:00,398
Yes.

393
00:25:02,008 --> 00:25:03,774
Do you mind?

394
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:10,125
Oh...

395
00:25:10,163 --> 00:25:11,997
Oh, that is not good.

396
00:25:12,034 --> 00:25:14,096
Not good at all.

397
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,632
Tell me

398
00:25:15,677 --> 00:25:17,409
how bad are the dreams?

399
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,113
They're not dreams.

400
00:25:19,153 --> 00:25:21,147
They're hallucinations.

401
00:25:21,259 --> 00:25:24,392
Actually, they're memories.

402
00:25:24,433 --> 00:25:26,905
Then why don't I remember them?

403
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,176
The balance is off.

404
00:25:30,283 --> 00:25:32,881
You mean the balance
between host and symbiont.

405
00:25:32,923 --> 00:25:36,125
What other balance is there?

406
00:25:36,164 --> 00:25:38,762
Someone's not playing fair.

407
00:25:38,804 --> 00:25:42,576
It wouldn't be Dax,
so it must be the host.

408
00:25:42,614 --> 00:25:45,747
You're saying the problem
is with Jadzia?

409
00:25:45,789 --> 00:25:47,224
No, no, not necessarily.

410
00:25:47,327 --> 00:25:49,264
Could be any one of the hosts.

411
00:25:50,668 --> 00:25:52,571
All right, Dax.

412
00:25:52,606 --> 00:25:54,236
Come with me.

413
00:25:54,311 --> 00:25:56,681
Let's see what we find.

414
00:26:09,973 --> 00:26:11,533
How'd it go?

415
00:26:11,578 --> 00:26:12,842
Timor is convinced

416
00:26:12,881 --> 00:26:14,681
that my hallucinations
have something to do

417
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,315
with one of my previous hosts.

418
00:26:16,357 --> 00:26:18,225
But he's not sure which one

419
00:26:18,261 --> 00:26:21,794
so he wants me to come back
again tomorrow to see him.

420
00:26:21,838 --> 00:26:23,273
We've got some good news.

421
00:26:23,308 --> 00:26:25,712
The computer's identified
your music.

422
00:26:25,781 --> 00:26:27,411
Can I hear it?

423
00:26:33,535 --> 00:26:34,731
That's it.

424
00:26:34,772 --> 00:26:36,173
The piece was written

425
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:38,942
by a Trill named Joran Belar
86 years ago.

426
00:26:38,982 --> 00:26:41,078
Does the name sound familiar?

427
00:26:41,121 --> 00:26:44,061
Joran Belar?

428
00:26:44,095 --> 00:26:45,759
I don't think so.

429
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,600
Is there a picture of him?

430
00:26:47,638 --> 00:26:49,039
I'll see.

431
00:27:23,632 --> 00:27:26,161
He left me no choice.

432
00:27:26,205 --> 00:27:27,800
Who are you?!

433
00:27:43,049 --> 00:27:44,484
Dax?

434
00:27:45,655 --> 00:27:47,387
Dax!

435
00:27:51,938 --> 00:27:54,172
She's in neural shock.

436
00:28:06,342 --> 00:28:09,407
We have to stabilize
her synaptic functions.

437
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:11,216
Activate the neural
induction field.

438
00:28:13,627 --> 00:28:16,999
Give her another two cc's
of benzocyatizine.

439
00:28:17,037 --> 00:28:18,063
Doctor...

440
00:28:18,106 --> 00:28:20,978
Her isoboramine levels
are down to 51 percent.

441
00:28:21,013 --> 00:28:23,177
I don't understand it,
a decrease that severe

442
00:28:23,219 --> 00:28:25,315
is usually the result
of tissue damage.

443
00:28:25,358 --> 00:28:28,126
Commander, this wormhole
you've discovered...

444
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:30,194
have your people
done any surveys

445
00:28:30,237 --> 00:28:32,265
of the diametric fields
it generates?

446
00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:35,408
Yes, in fact, Dax did the
most recent survey herself.

447
00:28:35,451 --> 00:28:36,818
I'd like to see those reports.

448
00:28:36,855 --> 00:28:38,553
Do you think
there's any correlation

449
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:40,586
between Dax's condition
and the wormhole?

450
00:28:40,631 --> 00:28:43,160
Something unusual is affecting
her, and at this point

451
00:28:43,205 --> 00:28:45,905
we can't afford
to rule anything out.

452
00:28:45,945 --> 00:28:48,509
If we can't get her
isoboramine readings

453
00:28:48,551 --> 00:28:51,115
up to an acceptable level
within 48 hours

454
00:28:51,158 --> 00:28:54,064
I'm afraid we'll have
to remove the symbiont.

455
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,729
But that will kill Jadzia!

456
00:28:55,771 --> 00:28:57,435
I'm well aware
of that, Commander

457
00:28:57,475 --> 00:29:00,472
but Jadzia would be
the first to tell you

458
00:29:00,516 --> 00:29:04,926
that our primary responsibility
must be to the symbiont.

459
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,934
If there's any change
in her condition

460
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:09,198
I'll let you know.

461
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:14,949
Timor, we need your help.

462
00:29:15,021 --> 00:29:16,685
Dax has gone
into neural shock.

463
00:29:16,724 --> 00:29:18,354
I'm sorry to hear that.

464
00:29:18,396 --> 00:29:19,922
The doctors at the
Symbiosis Commission

465
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,094
don't know what's causing it.

466
00:29:21,136 --> 00:29:22,162
You told Jadzia

467
00:29:22,206 --> 00:29:24,302
that her condition
had something to do

468
00:29:24,344 --> 00:29:26,440
with one of Dax's
previous hosts.

469
00:29:26,483 --> 00:29:29,285
That was just speculation.

470
00:29:29,324 --> 00:29:31,990
You told her
you were certain of it.

471
00:29:32,098 --> 00:29:34,832
If I gave that impression,
I apologize.

472
00:29:34,872 --> 00:29:37,367
Now, if you gentlemen
will excuse me

473
00:29:37,411 --> 00:29:39,006
the symbionts need me.

474
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:41,179
Jadzia needs you, too.

475
00:29:41,221 --> 00:29:42,212
She's dying!

476
00:29:42,258 --> 00:29:44,286
All we're asking
is that you come

477
00:29:44,329 --> 00:29:45,993
with us to the
Symbiosis Commission

478
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,800
and consult with Dr. Renhol.

479
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:50,368
I'm sorry, there's
nothing I can do.

480
00:29:50,412 --> 00:29:53,010
How do you know that
unless you try?

481
00:29:53,052 --> 00:29:55,046
Timor, what's going on here?

482
00:29:55,158 --> 00:29:58,223
Did someone tell you
not to pursue this?

483
00:29:58,266 --> 00:29:59,930
Why would anyone do that?

484
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:02,408
You tell me.

485
00:30:02,443 --> 00:30:05,007
I hope your friend recovers.

486
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:06,850
I truly do.

487
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:10,991
Now, if that's all,
I'm very busy.

488
00:30:11,032 --> 00:30:13,231
He's not busy, he's scared.

489
00:30:13,272 --> 00:30:16,542
Why would anyone want
to keep him quiet about this?

490
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,981
What are they trying to hide?

491
00:30:18,017 --> 00:30:19,008
Yesterday, Timor claimed

492
00:30:19,053 --> 00:30:21,217
the problem was with one
of Dax's previous hosts.

493
00:30:21,258 --> 00:30:23,388
Today, the mere mention
of the possibility

494
00:30:23,431 --> 00:30:24,457
makes him nervous.

495
00:30:24,501 --> 00:30:26,096
You'd think that
someone doesn't want

496
00:30:26,138 --> 00:30:27,768
an investigation of
those past hosts.

497
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:30,543
I can't think of a better reason
for such an investigation.

498
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:31,552
Can you?

499
00:30:31,586 --> 00:30:34,252
It's possible
that one of the Dax hosts

500
00:30:34,292 --> 00:30:37,391
had something to do
with this composer Belar.

501
00:30:37,434 --> 00:30:39,598
Well, Jadzia seemed
to lose consciousness

502
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,804
the minute she saw
Belar's picture.

503
00:30:41,845 --> 00:30:44,215
I think it's time we
found out more about him.

504
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:57,042
I've accessed the Trill
central database.

505
00:30:57,086 --> 00:31:00,390
Let's see what information
there is on Joran Belar.

506
00:31:02,332 --> 00:31:03,996
Here we are.

507
00:31:04,037 --> 00:31:06,031
Born on Stardate 1024.7

508
00:31:06,075 --> 00:31:08,877
Died on Stardate 8615.2.

509
00:31:08,915 --> 00:31:10,943
Is that all there is?

510
00:31:10,988 --> 00:31:12,686
Well, I was expecting
a lot more.

511
00:31:12,726 --> 00:31:14,059
When I looked through
Dax's records

512
00:31:14,096 --> 00:31:16,568
there was detailed
information on each host.

513
00:31:16,603 --> 00:31:18,437
Could the file have been purged?

514
00:31:18,474 --> 00:31:20,604
If part of the file's
been deleted

515
00:31:20,646 --> 00:31:23,118
the data compression
ratio might be off.

516
00:31:23,153 --> 00:31:24,315
Yeah, look at this.

517
00:31:24,356 --> 00:31:26,726
The ratio's for a file
five times larger.

518
00:31:26,762 --> 00:31:28,630
There was definitely
more information here.

519
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:30,159
Call up Dax's records.

520
00:31:30,204 --> 00:31:32,642
Put them side by side
with Joran's.

521
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:38,725
Wait a minute.

522
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,820
Look at these dates.

523
00:31:39,863 --> 00:31:44,102
Belar died on the same day
as Torias Dax died.

524
00:31:44,141 --> 00:31:47,479
The same day the Dax symbiont
was put into Curzon.

525
00:31:47,516 --> 00:31:50,148
Oh, this has to be more
than a coincidence.

526
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,634
Whoever purged the main database
might have missed something.

527
00:31:57,308 --> 00:32:01,216
Check the enrollment records
of all the Trill music academies

528
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,882
during Belar's lifetime.

529
00:32:04,728 --> 00:32:06,061
He's not listed.

530
00:32:06,098 --> 00:32:08,262
But there is someone here
with the same last name.

531
00:32:08,303 --> 00:32:09,149
Maybe they're related.

532
00:32:09,283 --> 00:32:10,684
Yolad Belar.

533
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,714
Check the central database.

534
00:32:12,758 --> 00:32:14,592
See if he's still alive.

535
00:32:16,836 --> 00:32:18,362
He is.

536
00:32:18,406 --> 00:32:20,036
Access the Trill
communications grid.

537
00:32:20,078 --> 00:32:21,069
Try to locate him.

538
00:32:22,584 --> 00:32:25,558
There's a reasonable chance
that he and Joran were related.

539
00:32:25,592 --> 00:32:27,586
Musical ability
often runs in families.

540
00:32:29,502 --> 00:32:30,971
I've established a com link.

541
00:32:31,073 --> 00:32:33,203
Put him on the main viewer.

542
00:32:37,223 --> 00:32:40,129
Yes, can I help you?

543
00:32:40,163 --> 00:32:41,827
I'm Commander Benjamin Sisko

544
00:32:41,868 --> 00:32:44,397
of the Federation Starbase
Deep Space 9.

545
00:32:44,441 --> 00:32:49,580
What would a Starfleet
officer want with me?

546
00:32:49,621 --> 00:32:51,455
Are you Yolad Belar?

547
00:32:51,492 --> 00:32:53,554
I am. Why?

548
00:32:53,598 --> 00:32:56,697
We're trying to find information
on a man named Joran Belar.

549
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,970
Do you know him?

550
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:01,143
Of course I did.
He was my brother.

551
00:33:02,989 --> 00:33:04,356
He was a composer?

552
00:33:04,393 --> 00:33:05,589
That's right.

553
00:33:05,629 --> 00:33:07,965
We both graduated
from the same music academy.

554
00:33:08,002 --> 00:33:09,494
Are you aware that his record

555
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:12,239
has been purged from
the academy's files?

556
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,014
That doesn't make any sense.

557
00:33:15,054 --> 00:33:17,218
What's this all about?

558
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,562
That's what we're trying
to find out.

559
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:22,664
Do you know if your brother
knew a joined Trill

560
00:33:22,707 --> 00:33:24,302
named Torias Dax?

561
00:33:24,345 --> 00:33:28,550
My brother died 85 years ago.

562
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:31,255
I, I have a hard time
remembering

563
00:33:31,296 --> 00:33:33,324
what happened yesterday.

564
00:33:33,368 --> 00:33:35,271
Then you don't remember
the name?

565
00:33:35,306 --> 00:33:36,536
No.

566
00:33:36,576 --> 00:33:40,279
But that doesn't mean
Joran didn't know him.

567
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:42,187
You say he was joined.

568
00:33:42,224 --> 00:33:43,854
They could have met

569
00:33:43,895 --> 00:33:47,860
when my brother went off
to become an initiate.

570
00:33:47,905 --> 00:33:49,808
He was a candidate for joining?

571
00:33:49,845 --> 00:33:52,647
That's what I just said,
isn't it?

572
00:33:52,685 --> 00:33:54,383
Was he given a symbiont?

573
00:33:54,423 --> 00:33:58,126
Not according
to the Symbiosis Commission.

574
00:33:58,199 --> 00:34:01,469
They claim he was dropped
from the program

575
00:34:01,508 --> 00:34:03,240
after the second year.

576
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:06,481
According to them,
he murdered the doctor

577
00:34:06,521 --> 00:34:09,085
that recommended dropping him

578
00:34:09,127 --> 00:34:12,568
and was killed trying
to escape the murder scene.

579
00:34:12,603 --> 00:34:15,634
Sounds like you're not convinced
that's what really happened.

580
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:20,054
Oh, I believe
he killed that doctor.

581
00:34:20,089 --> 00:34:24,122
My brother
had a violent temper.

582
00:34:24,166 --> 00:34:28,303
But about six months
before that happened

583
00:34:28,344 --> 00:34:30,816
my brother contacted me.

584
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:33,756
He sounded different somehow

585
00:34:33,792 --> 00:34:37,734
more confident,
even colder than usual

586
00:34:37,768 --> 00:34:41,574
and when I asked him
about it, he laughed.

587
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:46,523
He said he was different,
that he'd been joined.

588
00:34:46,558 --> 00:34:48,928
Did he tell you the name
of his symbiont?

589
00:34:48,964 --> 00:34:50,126
Hmm...

590
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:51,636
maybe he did.

591
00:34:51,671 --> 00:34:56,480
I was so surprised to learn
he'd been chosen to be joined

592
00:34:56,517 --> 00:34:58,955
I can't remember much else.

593
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:01,292
I loved my brother, Commander.

594
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:06,298
In spite of all the things
he did, I loved him.

595
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,113
Thank you for taking the time
to speak with us.

596
00:35:13,628 --> 00:35:15,724
Doctor, call up Dax's records.

597
00:35:15,767 --> 00:35:18,205
I think I'm beginning
to understand

598
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,800
what's going on here.

599
00:35:27,665 --> 00:35:30,160
According
to the official records

600
00:35:30,205 --> 00:35:34,546
after Torias died, the Dax
symbiont was put into Curzon.

601
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:37,112
What if that's not
what happened?

602
00:35:37,156 --> 00:35:40,962
What if Dax was given
another host before Curzon...

603
00:35:40,999 --> 00:35:44,269
a host who should never
have been given a symbiont?

604
00:35:44,341 --> 00:35:47,747
A host named Joran Belar.

605
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:01,779
Her isoboramine levels
have dropped to 44 percent.

606
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:05,261
Tell Dr. Torvin to prepare
the new host for surgery.

607
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:08,633
We'll begin transferring
the symbiont in 15 minutes.

608
00:36:08,671 --> 00:36:11,839
Tell Doctor Torvin
to get a cup of <i>raktajino.</i>

609
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:13,109
He won't be needed.

610
00:36:13,149 --> 00:36:14,779
Commander Sisko, how dare you
come in here and...

611
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,789
It's over, Doctor.

612
00:36:15,823 --> 00:36:17,555
We know about Joran Belar.

613
00:36:18,663 --> 00:36:19,757
Wait outside.

614
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,828
Tell the surgeons to stand by.

615
00:36:24,011 --> 00:36:25,845
I don't have time for this,
Commander.

616
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:27,649
The symbiont is in danger.

617
00:36:27,687 --> 00:36:28,747
So is Jadzia.

618
00:36:28,789 --> 00:36:31,695
I can't do anything for her.

619
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:34,329
Can't or won't?

620
00:36:34,437 --> 00:36:36,807
I resent that implication.

621
00:36:36,844 --> 00:36:38,838
And I resent having
to watch my friend die

622
00:36:38,883 --> 00:36:41,082
just so you can protect
your secret.

623
00:36:41,122 --> 00:36:42,250
What secret?

624
00:36:42,292 --> 00:36:44,263
Oh, I think you know.

625
00:36:44,297 --> 00:36:46,029
And the thought of it
becoming public

626
00:36:46,068 --> 00:36:47,367
scares the hell out of you.

627
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:49,376
Commander, I don't know
what you're talking about.

628
00:36:49,443 --> 00:36:50,469
I'm talking about the fact

629
00:36:50,513 --> 00:36:52,677
that, 86 years ago,
the Symbiosis Commission

630
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:55,921
mistakenly gave the Dax
symbiont to Joran Belar.

631
00:36:55,961 --> 00:36:58,490
I don't recall
ever seeing any mention

632
00:36:58,534 --> 00:37:00,630
of a Joran Dax on our records.

633
00:37:00,672 --> 00:37:01,902
And we both know why, Doctor.

634
00:37:01,942 --> 00:37:05,110
The Symbiosis Commission
altered the records

635
00:37:05,151 --> 00:37:06,245
just like they tried

636
00:37:06,287 --> 00:37:08,759
to erase all knowledge
of Joran from Dax's memory.

637
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:10,194
And now, after 80 years

638
00:37:10,231 --> 00:37:12,259
the memory block
is deteriorating

639
00:37:12,303 --> 00:37:15,300
and Dax is starting to
remember the Joran host.

640
00:37:15,344 --> 00:37:17,839
What possible reason
would anyone have

641
00:37:17,884 --> 00:37:20,652
to create that sort
of elaborate cover-up?

642
00:37:20,691 --> 00:37:22,389
We wondered about that, too.

643
00:37:22,429 --> 00:37:23,898
What was it about Joran

644
00:37:23,933 --> 00:37:26,132
that had to be hidden
at all costs?

645
00:37:26,172 --> 00:37:27,664
The fact that he never

646
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:30,548
should have been selected
as a host? No.

647
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:33,614
That simple error in judgment
wouldn't be enough, would it?

648
00:37:33,658 --> 00:37:35,184
There had to be something more.

649
00:37:35,229 --> 00:37:36,721
Something that would shake

650
00:37:36,766 --> 00:37:38,896
the very foundation
of your society.

651
00:37:38,939 --> 00:37:41,069
Tell me, Doctor,
how many of your people

652
00:37:41,111 --> 00:37:42,877
are suitable for joining?

653
00:37:42,916 --> 00:37:45,046
I don't see how that's relevant.

654
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:47,560
I understand
the percentage is very low...

655
00:37:47,594 --> 00:37:49,428
maybe one in a thousand?

656
00:37:49,466 --> 00:37:50,560
That's right.

657
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:52,300
Which is why the candidates

658
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,368
are put through
such rigorous testing.

659
00:37:54,412 --> 00:37:56,611
That's how we make sure
the symbionts

660
00:37:56,651 --> 00:37:58,747
aren't given
to an unsuitable host.

661
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:01,024
What would happen,
if, for some reason

662
00:38:01,063 --> 00:38:03,193
a symbiont was given
to an unsuitable host?

663
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,632
That doesn't happen.

664
00:38:06,677 --> 00:38:07,907
What if it did?

665
00:38:07,947 --> 00:38:09,439
Rejection would set in.

666
00:38:09,551 --> 00:38:12,319
The host and the symbiont
would both die.

667
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:14,296
How long before rejection
would set in?

668
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,471
Three, maybe four days.

669
00:38:17,505 --> 00:38:19,305
Then someone like Joran Belar

670
00:38:19,343 --> 00:38:22,283
an unstable personality
with violent tendencies

671
00:38:22,318 --> 00:38:24,984
should have rejected a symbiont
within a matter of days.

672
00:38:25,025 --> 00:38:26,494
Yet that didn't happen, did it?

673
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:27,997
According to our information

674
00:38:28,033 --> 00:38:29,731
he was joined
to the Dax symbiont

675
00:38:29,771 --> 00:38:31,138
for six months.

676
00:38:31,174 --> 00:38:34,775
Six months, Doctor.

677
00:38:34,817 --> 00:38:36,412
If a man like Joran Belar

678
00:38:36,454 --> 00:38:38,983
can be joined successfully
for that long

679
00:38:39,028 --> 00:38:41,466
how many others
can be joined as well?

680
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,497
Hundreds? Thousands?

681
00:38:44,542 --> 00:38:46,513
Certainly more
than the Symbiosis Commission

682
00:38:46,548 --> 00:38:47,949
would have us believe

683
00:38:47,985 --> 00:38:49,545
and that is what
you've been trying

684
00:38:49,655 --> 00:38:51,147
to cover up all along,
isn't it?

685
00:38:51,193 --> 00:38:54,429
That's why you're willing
to let Jadzia die!

686
00:38:59,247 --> 00:39:03,486
I'm not interested in exposing
your secret, Doctor.

687
00:39:03,525 --> 00:39:07,524
All I care about is Jadzia.

688
00:39:07,602 --> 00:39:11,476
And I promise you, if she dies

689
00:39:11,512 --> 00:39:15,072
I'll see to it that
the entire planet knows why.

690
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:23,187
Do you realize what would happen
if you did that?

691
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,094
It would mean chaos.

692
00:39:25,131 --> 00:39:28,196
There aren't enough symbionts
for that many hosts.

693
00:39:28,273 --> 00:39:29,469
The potential danger

694
00:39:29,509 --> 00:39:31,947
to the symbionts
would be enormous.

695
00:39:31,982 --> 00:39:35,515
They would become commodities
to be purchased

696
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:38,431
or prizes to be fought over.

697
00:39:38,465 --> 00:39:42,909
Nearly half our population
is capable of being joined.

698
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:49,717
That's what we learned
from our unfortunate experience

699
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,733
with Joran Dax.

700
00:39:55,042 --> 00:39:59,145
Now do you understand why you
must not reveal the truth?

701
00:39:59,187 --> 00:40:02,218
Do you understand my terms?

702
00:40:02,261 --> 00:40:04,665
It's not that simple.

703
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,101
For Jadzia to survive

704
00:40:06,138 --> 00:40:09,112
we have to stabilize
the synaptic functions

705
00:40:09,145 --> 00:40:11,309
between the host and symbiont.

706
00:40:11,418 --> 00:40:14,654
Joran's memories have
to be allowed to surface

707
00:40:14,693 --> 00:40:17,531
to reintegrate with
Dax's other memories.

708
00:40:17,567 --> 00:40:19,435
It could be very dangerous.

709
00:40:19,472 --> 00:40:20,964
Jadzia is a strong woman.

710
00:40:21,009 --> 00:40:22,877
I say we give her that chance.

711
00:40:22,914 --> 00:40:24,544
What if you're wrong?

712
00:40:24,585 --> 00:40:28,790
What if Joran's personality
overwhelms Jadzia?

713
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:31,064
Are you willing to risk that?

714
00:40:31,103 --> 00:40:34,636
The point is it's not up
to me or you to decide.

715
00:40:34,678 --> 00:40:37,550
It's her life
and her decision.

716
00:40:55,365 --> 00:40:57,302
Julian.

717
00:41:00,078 --> 00:41:02,676
We've got a lot to
talk about, Jadzia.

718
00:41:02,718 --> 00:41:05,384
You have a decision to make.

719
00:42:11,597 --> 00:42:13,261
Joran.

720
00:42:13,301 --> 00:42:15,500
You know who I am.

721
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:18,571
You're a part of me.

722
00:43:10,282 --> 00:43:11,410
Come in.

723
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:21,075
Checking up on me, Benjamin?

724
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:23,172
Just thought I'd see
how you were doing.

725
00:43:24,987 --> 00:43:30,525
Julian stopped by 15 minutes ago
and said the same thing.

726
00:43:32,506 --> 00:43:34,636
I'll be all right.

727
00:43:34,746 --> 00:43:38,118
I just need some time
to sort things out.

728
00:43:38,154 --> 00:43:40,353
I suppose it would
have been easier

729
00:43:40,394 --> 00:43:42,764
if you'd never
found out about Joran.

730
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,774
No, I'm glad I did.

731
00:43:45,808 --> 00:43:47,836
If you want to know
who you are

732
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,718
it's important to know
who you've been.

733
00:43:53,227 --> 00:43:54,753
Good night, old man.

734
00:44:00,044 --> 00:44:01,138
Benjamin.

735
00:44:02,986 --> 00:44:05,254
I'll see you in the morning.
