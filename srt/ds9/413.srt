1
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:12,220
One<i> raktajino,</i> extra hot,
two measures of<i> kava.</i>

2
00:00:16,976 --> 00:00:18,310
Time?

3
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,604
COMPUTER:
0759 hours.

4
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:39,414
Ah.

5
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,630
Good morning.

6
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,800
Major.

7
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,263
So...

8
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,227
(<i> sighs</i> )

9
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:03,230
How many
have we got?

10
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,106
16 items.

11
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:08,736
Oh, the station's criminal
element has been busy this week.

12
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:10,571
Oh, nothing out
of the ordinary.

13
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,614
Three petty thefts,

14
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:15,034
two incidents
of disorderly conduct,
one assault...

15
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:16,911
Ijarna's wife
hit him again?

16
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:19,246
Why does he stay
with her?

17
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,122
Skip to item 12.

18
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,918
"Public lewdness."

19
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:27,086
The same night
Ijarna reported the assault,

20
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:30,758
I found him and his wife...

21
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:32,175
behind
the Information Kiosk

22
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:35,012
on the second level.

23
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,597
That answers my question.

24
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:39,307
What about item seven?

25
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:40,976
Ah.

26
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:44,312
One of my deputies
caught Oguy Jel

27
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:47,066
scrawling political graffiti
on a wall in section 4.

28
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:49,068
He's always riled up
about something, isn't he?

29
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:50,527
What is it this time?

30
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,696
He was protesting
First Minister Shakaar's

31
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,406
upcoming visit to the station.

32
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,324
He's been handing out
leaflets saying

33
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:59,453
Shakaar should drop the petition
to join the Federation.

34
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:00,746
Well, leaflets are one thing.

35
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:02,414
Vandalism is quite another.

36
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:05,709
Oguy spent a night in a holding
cell for his trouble,

37
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:08,295
and I understand
the Arbiter

38
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:11,840
has sentenced him to three weeks
community service...

39
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,342
on sanitation duty.

40
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:16,804
(<i> chuckles</i> ) Just make sure
he scrubs that wall clean

41
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:18,680
before Shakaar gets here.

42
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,474
I don't want him
to see it.

43
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,601
Right.

44
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:24,311
I'd like to file
a complaint.

45
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,604
Not now, Quark.

46
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:28,315
A noise complaint
against you.

47
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,317
We are conducting
station business.

48
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,402
My quarters are
right below his.

49
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,571
You wouldn't believe
the racket he makes.

50
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,991
Quark!
Do you know
what it's like

51
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:38,993
to hear someone
practice shape-shifting?

52
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:41,369
Last night, it sounded
like a Takaran wildebeest

53
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,746
was tromping
around up there.

54
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:45,124
That was for all
of five minutes.

55
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:48,167
Once you complained, I took
the form of a Rafalian mouse.

56
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:52,089
Yeah, little tiny feet
skittering across the floor.

57
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:54,424
Back and forth,
back and forth.

58
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,052
You could hear that?
Hello?

59
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:59,805
Sometimes I can even
hear him... oozing around.

60
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,682
Well, maybe you should
change quarters.

61
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:02,724
Maybe he should have

62
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,392
a little more
consideration.

63
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,895
Shape-shifting in the
middle of the night--

64
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,188
there ought to be a
regulation against<i> that.</i>

65
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:10,649
Come back in half an hour.

66
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,400
I'll be happy to take
your complaint then.

67
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,652
Oh, I'll be back.

68
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:14,903
You can count on it.

69
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:21,827
It's just Quark's luck

70
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,704
that you would be assigned
quarters right above his.

71
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:27,041
Luck had nothing
to do with it.

72
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,062
I don't know why
Captain Sisko

73
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:49,604
insists on having
me here.

74
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,023
I'm not a senior officer.

75
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:52,649
Well, maybe he just
wanted to see you

76
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:53,650
in your dress uniform.

77
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,402
It does show off
your figure.

78
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,196
Why, thank you.

79
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:00,991
Good of you to
make it, old man.

80
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,202
Shakaar's transport
just docked.

81
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:05,746
Sorry. There were so many
people on the Promenade.

82
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,122
It<i> was</i> hard to get through.

83
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:08,790
KIRA:
I hope Shakaar's
gotten better

84
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,625
at speaking in
front of groups.

85
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,420
He used to mumble his way
through mission briefings.

86
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,130
Everyone in our
resistance cell

87
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,590
had to learn
to lip-read.

88
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,050
(<i> door opens</i> )

89
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,222
Welcome to Deep Space 9,
Minister.

90
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:24,973
Well, thank you, Captain.

91
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,226
I've been looking forward
to visiting the station

92
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:28,852
and to meeting the Emissary.

93
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:32,189
Uh... this is part
of my senior staff.

94
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,233
Lieutenant Commander
Jadzia Dax.

95
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:36,526
Chief of Operations
Miles O'Brien.

96
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,361
Dr. Bashir,
and, of course

97
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,280
you know Major Kira.

98
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,656
Nerys.

99
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,658
Good to see you again, Edon.

100
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:48,371
Well, I guess I should introduce
<i>my</i> senior staff.

101
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,748
There he is.

102
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:52,960
Sarish Rez,
the First Minister's adjutant.

103
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,669
A pleasure.
Come this way.

104
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,713
There's quite a crowd
on the Promenade

105
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:57,881
waiting to see you.

106
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,299
Oh, can't wait.

107
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,763
DAX:
Why didn't you tell me?

108
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,348
What?
He's so good-looking.

109
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,852
(<i> buzz of expectant</i>
<i>conversation</i> )

110
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,359
SISKO:
The guards will escort you
to the podium

111
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,527
whenever you're ready.

112
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,071
Don't forget
to mention

113
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,948
the transit subsidies
you just allocated.

114
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:25,033
Tell them they
can expect the price

115
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,244
of transport to Bajor
to start dropping

116
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,496
within a few months,
and remember-- enunciate.

117
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,539
Let's go.

118
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:32,540
Good luck.

119
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,834
Yeah.

120
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,418
ODO:
Odo to Captain Sisko.

121
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,878
Go ahead, Constable.

122
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,547
I've just received
a disturbing communication.

123
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,800
I have reason to believe
someone is planning

124
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,343
to assassinate
First Minister Shakaar.

125
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:46,174
As far as I'm concerned,
we should have gotten

126
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,926
the First Minister
off that podium

127
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,510
as soon as we received
the information.

128
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,888
If Shakaar canceled
his public appearances

129
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,015
every time someone
threatened his life,

130
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,101
he would never
leave his office.

131
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:58,186
We're not talking about some
disgruntled shopkeeper

132
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,439
who writes a letter
threatening Shakaar

133
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:01,940
for raising his taxes.

134
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,358
We're talking about

135
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:04,943
a Cardassian
extremist group

136
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,112
that's already succeeded
in assassinating

137
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,696
two Bajoran officials.

138
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,490
I know all about
"The True Way,"

139
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,492
and what they're capable of.

140
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,329
My sources in the Cardassian
civilian government

141
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:18,581
believe The True Way already
has an operative in place

142
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,875
aboard the station.
I suggest you cancel

143
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,253
the First Minister's conference
and reschedule it

144
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,379
at another location.

145
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,713
Absolutely not.

146
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,299
Nothing is going
to keep Shakaar

147
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:28,967
from meeting
those delegates tomorrow.

148
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,178
Bajor's effort to
join the Federation

149
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:34,139
hinges on what happens
over the next few days.

150
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,849
Shouldn't the decision be up
to the First Minister?

151
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,517
It will be.

152
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,312
But I already know
what he's going to say.

153
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:41,771
KIRA:
So do I.

154
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,315
Shakaar knows better
than anyone

155
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:44,858
you can't capitulate
to terrorists.

156
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,818
He used to be one,

157
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,653
and the day the Cardassians
started to negotiate with him

158
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,365
was the day he knew
they'd been beaten.
He'll stay.

159
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:52,782
SISKO:
I suppose if I were

160
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,535
in his position,
I'd do the same.

161
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,913
Constable, I want station
security stepped up

162
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,082
for the duration
of Shakaar's visit.

163
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:04,044
The First Minister will have
round-the-clock protection.

164
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,546
I'd like to deploy
Starfleet Security personnel

165
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,508
in addition
to my own deputies.
Of course.

166
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:12,719
Commander Eddington is on leave.
I'll ask Mr. Worf

167
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,679
to head up Starfleet
Security while he's gone.

168
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:22,854
I have cleared the rooms above,
below and to both sides

169
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,314
of the First Minister's
quarters.

170
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:25,899
I would recommend
clearing

171
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,151
that entire section
of the Habitat Ring.

172
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,445
I'm afraid
that isn't feasible.

173
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,739
There are over 1,200
people living there.

174
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,908
Providing security
was difficult enough

175
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,701
aboard the<i> Enterprise.</i>

176
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,620
It appears to be
next to impossible
on this station.

177
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,039
It isn't easy.

178
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,459
I prefer a more...
orderly environment.

179
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,711
We have that in common.

180
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,548
My people have
an innate need for order.

181
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:52,092
How do you tolerate
living here?

182
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,553
I make order where I can.

183
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:57,013
For one thing,
I have a daily routine

184
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,806
which I follow unwaveringly.

185
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,850
The shopkeepers
on the Promenade

186
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,019
joke that they can set
their clocks by me.

187
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,313
Unfortunately,
I have found it difficult

188
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,399
to establish a routine here.

189
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:11,445
There are other ways to create
order in your life--

190
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:12,987
your quarters, for example.

191
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:15,532
Everything in mine
has its specific place,

192
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,742
and it's all arranged just so.

193
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,412
Yes, mine, too.
Even with my eyes closed,

194
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:22,330
I would still know
where everything was.

195
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,957
Exactly.

196
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,126
I would not tolerate it
any other way.

197
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,668
I'll tell you what else to do.

198
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,504
Make sure everyone knows

199
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:32,673
they can't just drop by
your quarters to say "hello."

200
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:35,469
If someone does, whatever
happens, don't make them

201
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:36,553
feel welcome.

202
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:37,971
Of course not.

203
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,307
That would only invite
subsequent visits.

204
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:41,600
Precisely.

205
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,893
So far, the only person

206
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:48,148
that has a tendency to "drop by"
is Chief O'Brien.

207
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:51,943
That's probably because he
knows you from the<i> Enterprise.</i>

208
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:54,821
Perhaps if I am more...

209
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:58,074
inhospitable, he will stop.

210
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,909
Good luck.

211
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,248
Odo to Worf.

212
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:06,333
WORF:
Go ahead.

213
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,834
The guards are in position.

214
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,794
The corridors
between Shakaar's quarters

215
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,213
and the Wardroom
have been cleared.
WORF: Acknowledged.

216
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,090
The First Minister is scheduled
to leave for the reception

217
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,883
in half an hour.

218
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,594
The Wardroom will be scanned
and secured well before then.

219
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:18,719
(<i> door opens</i> )

220
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,641
You must be Odo.
First Minister.

221
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:24,601
I was hoping
I'd get to meet you.

222
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,854
I just wish it wasn't
under these circumstances.

223
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,397
We're ready to go.

224
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,441
Well, the reception doesn't
start for another...

225
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:32,775
I know.

226
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,152
I want to stop by the Promenade

227
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:35,362
and visit the Temple first.

228
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,738
Why wasn't I
told about this?

229
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,991
I didn't know myself
until a moment ago.

230
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,826
Is there a problem?

231
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:45,079
I would have posted extra
security on the Promenade.

232
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,374
Oh, well, we'll
just, uh, slip in.

233
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:50,418
I'll stay for a few minutes,
and then we'll slip out.

234
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,629
With all due respect, sir,

235
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,088
now that you're
First Minister,

236
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,632
you can't slip
in or out of bed

237
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:56,966
without
people noticing.

238
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,176
(<i> laughs</i> )

239
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,928
Maybe not, but
that doesn't mean

240
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,431
I'm going to<i> stay</i>
in bed all day.

241
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,645
Odo to Worf.

242
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:12,482
There's been a change of plans.

243
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:15,985
SHAKAAR:
I understand you used to work
for the Cardassians

244
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,112
when they were running
this station.

245
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,365
I was in charge
of keeping order

246
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:21,616
on the Promenade.

247
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:23,076
They could have
given that job

248
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,411
to one of their own people.

249
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,079
They must have thought
very highly of you.

250
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,373
Humph.
I know Kira does.

251
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,958
She once told me she trusted
you with her life.

252
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,044
Well, I'm gratified
to hear that.

253
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:36,089
I always found her to be
a good judge of character.

254
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,049
So I'll trust you
with mine, too.

255
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,470
Oh, it's him.

256
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:45,890
First Minister.

257
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,184
Gentlemen, how are you?
Hi.

258
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,483
How are you today?

259
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,113
Worf to Odo.
We have secured the Temple.

260
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,198
I'll try to get him
inside as soon as I can.

261
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,783
Welcome.

262
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:06,494
Pleasure to see you here.

263
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,786
How do you do?

264
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:08,829
Pleasure.

265
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,419
FEMALE:
It's nice to meet you.

266
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:15,920
I appreciate you being here.

267
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,963
Thank you.

268
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,172
Nice to see you.

269
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,024
(<i> exhales</i> )

270
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,055
KIRA:
Is it always
like this?

271
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,432
It's not often that
people get a chance

272
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:10,975
to talk
to the First Minister.

273
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,268
And besides,

274
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,520
have you ever
met a Bajoran

275
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,813
who didn't have

276
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:16,939
a fervent opinion
about everything

277
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,484
from prophetic interpretation
to farm policy?

278
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:21,361
I guess not.

279
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,112
Is that Vedek Tonsa?

280
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,699
Yes, it is.

281
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,950
I hear he's an excellent
springball player.

282
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,036
Oh, the best on
the station. Why?

283
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,580
Well, I think I'll see
if we can arrange a game.

284
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,290
Oh, you better
be good.

285
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,792
I'm terrible.

286
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:38,169
But it will give me
a chance to talk to him

287
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:40,296
about supporting Shakaar
in the Vedek Assembly.

288
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,225
Do you have to
stare like that?

289
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,477
I think it's making
people nervous.

290
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:55,978
Good.

291
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,982
You know...

292
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,026
I've been meaning
to ask you.

293
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,738
Why don't you wear
that belt anymore?

294
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,032
I don't know.

295
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:11,452
It didn't really
serve a purpose.

296
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:15,039
It's not as if I needed it
to hold my pants up.

297
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,708
I just thought it
looked good on you.

298
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:17,834
That's all.

299
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,380
Really?

300
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,132
Really.

301
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,682
Well...

302
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:35,017
if you say so.

303
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,025
Better?

304
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:45,820
Much.

305
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,991
I guess
I'll turn in.

306
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,790
Of course.

307
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,792
Good night, Major.

308
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,126
Good night.

309
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,882
Will you excuse me?

310
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,802
Nerys...

311
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:09,886
where are you going?

312
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,554
You haven't
even said hello.

313
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:12,889
You were so busy.

314
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,474
I didn't want
to bother you.

315
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,100
You wouldn't be
bothering me.

316
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,644
You'd be rescuing me.

317
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,562
That bad?

318
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,398
You have no idea.

319
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,358
Then I supposed now wouldn't
be a good time for me

320
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,527
to give you my opinion
on how Bajor

321
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,696
should be dealing
with the Klingons.

322
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,281
Actually, it would.

323
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:31,491
But not here.

324
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,951
I was joking.

325
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:34,034
Fine.

326
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,789
We'll talk
about something else.

327
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:40,207
Care for
some<i> hasperat?</i>

328
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:43,252
You know I don't eat.
Have some.

329
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,212
I'm charging by the head
for this little function,

330
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:48,007
and you do
have a head...
for the moment.

331
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,387
Let's take a walk.

332
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,848
Okay.

333
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,314
ODO:
Minister?

334
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:04,774
Uh, we're going
to take a stroll.

335
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,693
If you tell me
where you're going,

336
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,194
I'll secure your route.

337
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,070
If I knew
where we were going,

338
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,281
it wouldn't be a stroll,
would it?

339
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,200
I suppose not.

340
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,576
I'll escort you.

341
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,662
Fine, but, uh, just you.

342
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:22,834
Oh, and, uh, don't
stay too close, huh?

343
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:36,806
(<i> indistinct conversation</i> )

344
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,937
(<i> Kira laughing</i> )

345
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,820
(<i> laughter continues</i> )

346
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,544
Let's go.

347
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:07,962
Where?

348
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:09,463
Back to my quarters.

349
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,717
This way.

350
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:16,303
I take it
the negotiations

351
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,305
aren't going
all that well.

352
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,182
How'd you know?

353
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,602
The truth is the Bajorans
are even less successful

354
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:25,312
than most humanoids
at hiding their emotions.

355
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,189
So you're saying
it's as plain

356
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,608
as the nose on my face?

357
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,777
I've been working
with the Federation

358
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,194
for a number of years.

359
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,655
They claim to be
open and understanding,

360
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,909
but somehow, they're always
convinced that they're right.

361
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:40,202
It can be exasperating
at times.

362
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,955
I've been trying to get them
to cut the timetable

363
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,748
for Bajor's admittance
into the Federation by half,

364
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,165
but every time
I think I've made them

365
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,376
understand my reasons,
they remind me

366
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,336
that<i> every</i> member
of the Federation

367
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,881
has gone through the
same admittance process.

368
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,967
And why should Bajor
be any different?

369
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:56,094
I can't think
of a single reason.

370
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:58,054
Unless, of course, you take
into account the effect

371
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:00,932
that 50 years of occupation
might have on a society.

372
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:02,558
Thank you.

373
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,562
You know, I've
been a soldier,

374
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,107
and I've been a politician,

375
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:11,525
and I have to say
I'm beginning to think

376
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,403
that being a soldier
was easier.

377
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,114
Ahh...

378
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:19,993
Well, I'm afraid
I don't know much
about politics.

379
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,619
Well, you agree with me.

380
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:24,204
As far as I'm concerned,
that makes you an expert.

381
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:33,464
I realize I haven't been
making your job any easier

382
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:34,841
the past few days.

383
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:37,135
Well, I can't
argue with that.

384
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:39,137
Well, I just want you
to understand

385
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:41,388
that, uh, I appreciate
your thoroughness.

386
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,349
Thank you.

387
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,934
Yeah.

388
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,939
Odo, uh...

389
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:54,652
I know that you
and Nerys are friends,

390
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:56,988
and I was wondering...

391
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:59,406
does she ever talk
to you about me?

392
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,450
Of course.

393
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,787
She's spoken about you
on more than one occasion.

394
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:08,582
Well, what I mean is, has
she ever said anything to you

395
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,918
that might indicate
that she...

396
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,629
thought of me
as more than a friend?

397
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,882
Ah.

398
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,511
Well, let me think.

399
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:26,142
No.

400
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,728
Oh, I see.

401
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:38,112
Oh, I've-- I've known Nerys
for over ten years.

402
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,530
Uh...

403
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,866
I've trusted her with my life

404
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:43,868
on more than one occasion.

405
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:45,244
So have I.

406
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:49,040
She always knew
how to follow orders.

407
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,750
She never complained
when things got rough.

408
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,751
She was a good soldier.

409
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,711
A good friend.

410
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:55,588
But now it's...

411
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,339
it's different.

412
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,008
Is it?

413
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,261
She's still your friend.

414
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,387
I know.

415
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:07,641
I think I'm falling in love
with her.

416
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:12,479
Sometimes, I get
the sense that maybe,

417
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,066
just maybe...

418
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:17,818
she feels the same way...

419
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,695
but I could be wrong.

420
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,240
I'm afraid
to say anything

421
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,409
because it, it might
ruin our friendship.

422
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:29,329
But if I don't, I could be
letting something very precious

423
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,998
slip through my fingers.

424
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:33,960
It's a...

425
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,546
difficult situation.

426
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,006
Yeah.

427
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,427
Well, for all I know,

428
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:46,847
I've gotten myself
all twisted up over nothing.

429
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,516
I mean, if she hasn't
said anything to you,

430
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:52,979
then this whole thing is
probably just inside my head.

431
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:56,607
Frankly, I think
she's still grieving

432
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,358
for Vedek Bareil.

433
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:01,279
Oh, of course.
It's only natural.

434
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:05,574
Maybe I should
just be patient.

435
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,618
That's what I would do.

436
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,789
On the other hand,

437
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:15,793
maybe I should let
her know how I feel.

438
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:18,296
It might help her
to get over her loss

439
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:20,756
if she knew that
there was somebody

440
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,176
who really cared
about her.

441
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:25,427
What do you think?

442
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:30,766
I'm afraid I know even less
about relationships

443
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,977
than I do about politics.

444
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:35,146
Well, I understand.

445
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:37,648
I... I don't mean
to burden you

446
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:40,484
with my problems.

447
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:43,361
Talking about
humanoid relationships

448
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:46,406
can't be that
interesting to you.

449
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:49,076
For the most part, no.

450
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:05,676
(<i> sighs</i> )

451
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:07,469
You don't have
to bother.

452
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,096
I can personally vouch

453
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,430
for every one
of my employees

454
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,849
who had access
to that food.

455
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:12,808
Ha.

456
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,768
I can't tell you

457
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,896
how relieved
that makes me feel.

458
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:23,152
I'm reading some sort
of power signature.

459
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:25,821
Ah...

460
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,032
(<i> chuckles</i> )

461
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:31,618
A Ferengi eavesdropping device.

462
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:34,663
I don't suppose you know
anything about this.

463
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,165
Oh! There it is.

464
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,376
I've been looking
for that all day.

465
00:23:38,376 --> 00:23:40,169
You admit it's yours?

466
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:42,255
I must have misplaced it.

467
00:23:42,255 --> 00:23:45,007
I take it you were hoping
to peddle information

468
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:46,675
about Shakaar's meeting.

469
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,386
Odo, you know
as well as I do

470
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:51,347
that it's illegal to listen
to someone's conversation

471
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:52,430
without their consent.

472
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,225
Why else would
someone like you

473
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:56,476
own such an expensive
listening device?

474
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,731
I use it to monitor
Rom's sleep.

475
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:03,525
You see, ever
since he was a boy,

476
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,443
my brother's had
this condition

477
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:07,571
where he sometimes
stops breathing

478
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,573
in the middle of the night.

479
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,701
The fact is... I can't sleep
unless I know he's all right.

480
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,329
Very touching.

481
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:16,747
Oh!

482
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:18,707
How clumsy of me.

483
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,043
You are in a bad
mood today.

484
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,169
I don't have moods.

485
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,379
Of course not.

486
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:24,922
You're an unfeeling
changeling.

487
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,299
All you care
about is order.

488
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:27,383
That's right.

489
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:28,634
Oh, please.

490
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:30,136
I know what's going on.

491
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:32,679
You don't have to pretend
with me.

492
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:35,391
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

493
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:37,059
You're in love with her.

494
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,769
Who?

495
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:39,895
Kira.

496
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:44,817
(<i> snorts</i> )
That's ridiculous!

497
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:47,278
And what's more,
you're worried

498
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:49,529
she's falling in love
with Shakaar.

499
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,115
Is that a fact?

500
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:52,699
It's the truth.

501
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,410
Why can't you
just admit it?

502
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,412
It's nothing
to be ashamed of.

503
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:59,539
Look, Odo, I know
this can't be easy for...

504
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,708
I don't<i> want</i> your
sympathy, Quark,

505
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,627
and I don't need your advice!

506
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,796
Just stay out
of my business!

507
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:12,636
(<i> sighs</i> )

508
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:26,108
Computer, time.

509
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:28,777
COMPUTER:
0821 hours.

510
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,992
I'm sorry I'm late.

511
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:37,577
I didn't realize
what time it was.

512
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:38,996
(<i> sighs</i> )

513
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:40,498
So what do we have?

514
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:42,666
Nine items.

515
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,626
Well, so far it's all

516
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,004
fairly routine.

517
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,341
Something wrong?

518
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:53,093
Your<i> raktajino?</i>

519
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:56,722
Oh! I had one this morning
with Shakaar.

520
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:00,934
I... I didn't see you
in the Replimat.

521
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,436
No, it was in his quarters.

522
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:03,854
He asked me to look over

523
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:05,731
a proposal he's
going to make

524
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,400
to the Federation delegates.

525
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,151
Ahh...

526
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:11,820
There's an interesting story
behind item four.

527
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,822
And I would love
to hear it, but I'm

528
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:17,701
a little pressed for time
right now.
Of course.

529
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:20,037
I promised Shakaar I'd give him
a tour of the station.

530
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:23,290
I'll make sure
security is in place.

531
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,001
Thank you.
See you later.

532
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,432
The Upper Pylons have the
best view of the wormhole.

533
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:40,891
I've never seen
it, actually.

534
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,893
KIRA:
Why don't we wait
a few minutes?

535
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:45,187
Maybe a ship will
go through.
You can see it open.

536
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:46,939
SHAKAAR:
Well, you're
the First Officer.

537
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:47,981
Can't you...

538
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,816
order a ship through?

539
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:52,236
Well, you're
the First Minister.

540
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:56,323
You should be able to order
a whole<i> fleet</i> through.

541
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,491
(<i> chuckling</i> )

542
00:26:57,491 --> 00:27:00,286
The other day,
I heard someone say

543
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:04,081
that if you happen to
see the wormhole open,
you get to make a wish.

544
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:06,500
Oh. That's been going around
the station for a while now.

545
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,876
Uh-huh.

546
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,837
Look.

547
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:16,552
Did you make a wish?

548
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:19,346
Yes.

549
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:35,028
We should get going.
There's a lot more to see.

550
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,657
Odo to Worf.

551
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:41,452
WORF:
Go ahead.

552
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:43,412
We're heading back down
to the Docking Ring.

553
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:44,830
Acknowledged.

554
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,664
Your route has been secured.

555
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:48,417
Level 2-D.

556
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,210
COMPUTER:
Please enter security code.

557
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:56,091
You know, I, um...

558
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,636
haven't had a meal
outside the Wardroom,

559
00:27:58,636 --> 00:28:01,639
or my quarters,
since I got here.

560
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:04,600
Well, there's some
pretty nice places to eat

561
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,226
on the Promenade.

562
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,811
You have a favorite?

563
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,771
There's a new
Bolian restaurant

564
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,148
that's pretty good.

565
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:13,150
I've never had
Bolian food.

566
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,195
Well, this isn't going
to sound very appetizing,

567
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:18,071
but the meat they use is...

568
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,657
sort of... aged.

569
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:21,367
Aged.

570
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:22,660
Worf to Odo.

571
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,537
A turbolift is stuck
on Level 41.

572
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:27,039
We are going to have
to reroute you.

573
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,499
Verify your security code,

574
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:30,626
and I'll release the controls
to you.

575
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:32,294
KIRA:
You don't want to know.

576
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:34,588
SHAKAAR:
Why don't we go
there tonight?

577
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,423
I'd love to.

578
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,715
Great. How does
1900 hours sound?

579
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:38,676
We can--

580
00:28:38,676 --> 00:28:39,718
(<i> loud thud</i> )

581
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,388
We're falling!

582
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:44,598
Kira to Worf.

583
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:48,894
Someone cut our com links.

584
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:52,105
Controls aren't
responding.

585
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,250
(<i> panel beeping</i> )

586
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,191
(<i> metal screeching</i> )

587
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,459
(<i> sighs</i> )

588
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:56,503
(<i> both sigh in relief</i> )

589
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,004
Well...

590
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:00,424
I guess this means
my tour is over.

591
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,971
You're telling me
someone overrode

592
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:09,015
the station's com system,
faked Worf's voice,

593
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,976
and then sent one
of our turbolifts

594
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:12,311
into a free fall?

595
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:13,979
I'm afraid so, sir.

596
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:16,398
Apparently, they tapped
into the com system

597
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:18,150
with a voice synthesizer.

598
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,485
What I want to know is

599
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:21,779
how they got Worf's
security code.

600
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:24,156
We don't know that
they did that, sir.

601
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,616
What do you mean?

602
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,620
I turned over control
of the turbolift

603
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:32,205
without verifying
his code.

604
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:35,626
They say to err is human.

605
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:37,586
But you're not human, Odo.

606
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:39,212
You're not even humanoid.

607
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,632
And this is not
the sort of mistake

608
00:30:41,632 --> 00:30:43,676
that I'd expect from you.

609
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:45,761
I...

610
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:47,262
was distracted.

611
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,639
Distracted?

612
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:50,390
A personal matter, sir.

613
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:53,811
I'd prefer
not to discuss it.

614
00:30:53,811 --> 00:30:55,270
Constable...

615
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,481
whatever this
personal matter is,

616
00:30:57,481 --> 00:31:00,400
don't let it interfere
with your job again.

617
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,860
I won't, sir.

618
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:06,281
That's all I need to hear.

619
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:11,203
Now, no ships have been
allowed to leave

620
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,663
since this incident occurred.

621
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:14,581
That means whoever
was responsible

622
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,333
is still on the station.

623
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:17,917
I want them found.

624
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,336
Yes, sir.

625
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,182
It appears that they accessed
the turbolift control system

626
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:33,892
through the ODN relays.

627
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:39,022
There might be a trace
of the access signal

628
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:41,441
left in the relays.

629
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:45,278
If we can isolate it,
we might be able to follow
it back to the source.

630
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,864
Odo!

631
00:31:46,864 --> 00:31:48,615
Are you listening?

632
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:52,202
I've heard every word.

633
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:54,705
Your mind does not appear
to be on its work.

634
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:58,375
With all due respect, Commander,
you don't know me well enough

635
00:31:58,375 --> 00:31:59,877
to gauge my state of mind.

636
00:31:59,877 --> 00:32:01,169
When someone fails

637
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,463
to ask for a security
verification,

638
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,131
their state of mind is obvious.

639
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:06,717
Is it?

640
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:08,510
With all due respect,

641
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,929
I do not see how sitting
in a chair, staring at a wall

642
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,473
is going to help apprehend
Shakaar's would-be assassin.

643
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:16,894
You're right.
It won't.

644
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,606
I'm going to talk
to Major Kira.

645
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:23,692
Why? She already gave
us her statement.

646
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:25,694
You follow your leads,
Commander.

647
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:27,571
I'll follow mine.

648
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,501
Jimenez.

649
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,924
What are these
men doing here?

650
00:32:46,924 --> 00:32:49,802
First Minister Shakaar's
in Major Kira's quarters, sir.

651
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:51,386
How long has
he been there?

652
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,346
Since they
finished dinner.

653
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:54,765
About three hours ago.

654
00:32:54,765 --> 00:32:57,100
All right, Ensign,
you're relieved.

655
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,853
Sir, I'm not scheduled
to go off duty...

656
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:01,313
I said you're relieved.

657
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:03,356
I'll take the rest
of your shift.

658
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,858
Yes, sir.

659
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,337
KIRA:
Let's have dinner.

660
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,798
Great. I'll
see you then.

661
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,718
Good morning.

662
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,720
May I ask where you're
going, First Minister?

663
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,263
To my quarters

664
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,641
and then to the meeting
in the Wardroom.

665
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:42,855
Major,

666
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:44,523
I was wondering
if you had a moment

667
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:46,232
to answer a few questions
about what happened

668
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,985
in the turbolift.
Sure, come on in.

669
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,237
Lights.

670
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:03,625
Did I do something
amusing?

671
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:05,168
No. It's...

672
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,381
Edon and I...

673
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,508
Oh, I understand.

674
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:13,092
Oh, Odo...

675
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:15,345
if someone had told me
a year ago

676
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:17,222
that this was
going to happen,

677
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:19,098
do you know what
I would have said?

678
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:20,517
"You're crazy.

679
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:22,602
"Yes, I respect him,
yes, I...

680
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:25,689
"He makes me laugh, bu-but we
know each other too well.

681
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:28,274
"I mean, he's seen me
go weeks without a bath.

682
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:31,028
"We've spent long cold nights
huddled together for warmth.

683
00:34:31,028 --> 00:34:33,030
"There's no mystery left
between us.

684
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,614
We're friends, that's all."

685
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:35,657
(<i> sighs</i> )

686
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:37,701
I guess I was wrong.

687
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:44,708
I'm happy for you.

688
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:49,170
This must seem so silly to you.

689
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,590
No.

690
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,299
Not in the least.

691
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:03,769
You are such
a good friend to me.

692
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:06,813
I'm so glad you're
the first person to know.

693
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:10,609
Oh, now, um...

694
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:13,028
you wanted
to ask me something

695
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:15,822
about what happened
in the turbolift.

696
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:18,366
Yes, but we can talk
about it later.

697
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,826
Oh no, are you sure?

698
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:20,786
Yes.

699
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:22,913
I have an appointment.

700
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:25,624
(<i> laughing</i> )
All right.

701
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:31,296
(<i> sighs</i> )

702
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:37,761
(<i> breathing shakily</i> )

703
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,647
Take him to a holding cell.

704
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,651
What'd he do?

705
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:54,736
He was responsible
for the attack

706
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:56,279
on First Minister Shakaar.

707
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,823
What?

708
00:35:57,823 --> 00:36:00,742
He has admitted to being
a True Way operative.

709
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:03,286
They provided him with
an isolinear interface

710
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,621
to access station systems.

711
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:07,373
He was attempting to use it

712
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:09,208
to depressurize
Shakaar's quarters

713
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,753
by sabotaging
the environmental controls.

714
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:13,463
I see.

715
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:15,214
When he tried to access them,

716
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,216
I traced the signal path
back to him.

717
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,802
He was operating

718
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:20,720
out of an abandoned
cargo hold on Level 31.

719
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:26,143
Why didn't you call me
before you made the arrest?

720
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:27,727
It was not necessary.

721
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:30,981
Your deputies assisted me
quite capably.

722
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:32,524
They are well-trained.

723
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:34,651
You are to be commended.

724
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,087
(<i> yelling</i> )

725
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:07,726
(<i> door chimes</i> )

726
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:10,353
QUARK:
I know you're in there.

727
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,022
I heard you.

728
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:15,734
Fine.

729
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,694
We'll do this the hard way.

730
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,040
I knew it would come to this.

731
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,000
You take the form
of an animal,

732
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,293
you're going to end up
behaving like one.

733
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:36,046
What was it?
A Klingon<i> targ?</i>

734
00:37:36,046 --> 00:37:37,589
A Trellan crocodile?

735
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:41,259
I tell you,

736
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,595
this time, you've
crossed the line.

737
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,138
I've had it!

738
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,142
Odo?

739
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:51,561
Odo!

740
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:53,730
Are you okay?

741
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,523
You were right.

742
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:58,110
Oh.

743
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:02,239
I take it Major Kira
and Shakaar are...

744
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:07,702
You really are in love.

745
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,287
I must say,

746
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,998
I really didn't think
you had it in you.

747
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:15,001
It takes passion
to do something like this,

748
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:17,378
and I always thought
you were colder

749
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,297
than a Breen winter.

750
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:22,050
What was I thinking?

751
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,261
How could I have fooled myself

752
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:27,639
into believing she could ever
love someone like me?

753
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:28,765
Look, uh...

754
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:30,267
the last thing
I want to do

755
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:32,393
is interfere with
your personal life,

756
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,104
but this, uh...

757
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:36,273
this just isn't
any good...

758
00:38:36,273 --> 00:38:38,984
for either of us.

759
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:42,361
I'll try to keep my problems
more quiet next time.

760
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:44,072
I'm not talking
about the noise.

761
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:45,490
I'm talking about business.

762
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,242
I'm losing my shirt
in the manhunt pool.

763
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:50,203
The what?

764
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:51,579
Anytime there's
an unusual crime

765
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,665
committed on this station,
I run a pool

766
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,834
so that people can bet
on how long it'll take

767
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,752
for you to catch
the perpetrator.

768
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:00,046
It's very popular.

769
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,132
Frankly, I don't care

770
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:03,925
whether you
and Major Kira

771
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:05,718
end up living happily
ever after or not.

772
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,637
I just want to see
the situation resolved.

773
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:10,056
And the way I see it,

774
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:12,350
you've either got to
tell her how you feel

775
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:16,354
or forget about her and
get on with your life.

776
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:20,192
Concentrate on
the essentials...

777
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:22,277
because you can't
keep going like this.

778
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:23,778
It's interfering
with your job

779
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,571
and my profits.

780
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:28,200
(<i> sighs</i> )
Your profits.

781
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,368
Unless you do
something about
this situation,

782
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,370
I'm going to have to
stop running the pool.

783
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,373
I'm devastated.

784
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:38,043
You should be.

785
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:39,752
The fact that
the pool exists

786
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:41,338
says something
about you--

787
00:39:41,338 --> 00:39:43,131
about who you are.

788
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:45,008
People see you
as the guy

789
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:47,177
who always
gets his man.

790
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:49,595
Now you're
becoming the guy

791
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:51,389
who tears up his quarters

792
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,558
and sits alone
in the rubble.

793
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,643
And no one's going
to want to place bets

794
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,104
on how long someone's going
to sit around in the dark.

795
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:01,941
Well...

796
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:04,361
I've said my piece.
Sorry for butting in.

797
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,614
But I'm just looking
out for my business.

798
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,743
Funny.

799
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:14,579
For a minute there, I thought
you were talking to me...

800
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,039
as a friend.

801
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:21,586
Nah.

802
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:30,220
(<i> door opens and closes</i> )

803
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:42,523
(<i> door chimes</i> )

804
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,733
Yes.

805
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:46,736
Good morning, Major.

806
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:47,820
Oh, come in.

807
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,115
What brings you here?

808
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:52,409
I wanted to talk to
you about something.

809
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:53,618
What is it?

810
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,080
I...

811
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,375
don't quite know
how to say this...

812
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,630
but I've given it
a lot of thought...

813
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:08,216
and, uh...

814
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,265
Well, go on.

815
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,435
Just say it.

816
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:25,400
I am afraid
I won't be able to make

817
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,819
our Tuesday morning meetings
anymore.

818
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:29,654
Oh.

819
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:30,905
Why not?

820
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:33,325
I've decided to schedule

821
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:36,702
additional training exercises
with my deputies.

822
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:39,998
Maybe we could have our meetings
at another time.

823
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:43,251
My schedule is rather tight.

824
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:46,545
And let's face it,

825
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:49,382
the criminal activity reports
speak for themselves.

826
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:50,883
There's really no reason

827
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:53,094
we have to review
them together.

828
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:56,139
Maybe not,
but I kind of enjoyed doing it.

829
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:57,932
I thought you did, too.

830
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:01,602
Of course.

831
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:03,396
Odo...

832
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,816
is something wrong?

833
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:11,446
It's just a matter of using
my time more efficiently.

834
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,535
I understand.

835
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:19,996
Well.

836
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:21,080
(<i> clears throat</i> )

837
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,209
Hey.
No belt?

838
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:29,547
I'm just trying to keep
to the essentials, Major.

839
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:34,635
See you.

840
00:42:44,396 --> 00:42:46,647
(<i> buzz of conversation</i> )

841
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:56,699
They're upstairs.

842
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,784
Who?

843
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:00,537
Kira and Shakaar.

844
00:43:00,537 --> 00:43:03,081
They're in Holosuite 3
practicing the speech

845
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:05,208
he's going to give tomorrow
before he leaves.

846
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:06,834
I hear he's going
to announce

847
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,545
that the Federation has
agreed to cut the timetable

848
00:43:08,545 --> 00:43:09,962
on Bajor's admittance.

849
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,964
Where did you
hear that?

850
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:13,674
Just a rumor.

851
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,510
Are you sure
you haven't been

852
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:18,012
listening in on your
holosuites again?

853
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,889
Even if I wanted to,
I couldn't.

854
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:21,057
I don't have
the right equipment.

855
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:23,268
Hmm, not anymore.

856
00:43:25,395 --> 00:43:27,021
By the way,

857
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:29,857
I dropped by your quarters
this morning.

858
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:31,526
Oh?

859
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:33,819
I heard some noise,
and when I went to complain,

860
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:35,780
I found a work crew

861
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,907
installing soundproofing
in the floor.

862
00:43:37,907 --> 00:43:40,785
I have to say, Odo,
I'm touched that you

863
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:43,413
would do something
like that for me.

864
00:43:43,413 --> 00:43:45,415
I'm having the floor
reinforced.

865
00:43:45,415 --> 00:43:48,543
The fact that they're
soundproofing it as well
is incidental.

866
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:50,295
Mm-hmm.

867
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:52,755
If you think I'd put up
with three days of construction

868
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:55,049
for your sake, think again.

869
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:57,510
I guess I should
have known.

870
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:59,345
Thanks anyway.

871
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,889
Don't mention it.

872
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,975
Hmm.

873
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:05,851
(<i> Kira laughing</i> )

874
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:08,229
What?
That's what she said.

875
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:10,607
No! I don't believe it.

876
00:44:10,607 --> 00:44:13,025
Okay, from the beginning.
Tell me the whole thing.

877
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:15,111
Well, they're either going
to do it, or they're not...
