1
00:00:08,545 --> 00:00:12,544
One <i>raktajino,</i> extra hot,
two measures of <i>kava.</i>

2
00:00:17,233 --> 00:00:18,532
Time?

3
00:00:18,569 --> 00:00:20,904
0759 hours.

4
00:00:37,615 --> 00:00:39,609
Ah.

5
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,792
Good morning.

6
00:00:48,308 --> 00:00:49,937
Major.

7
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,314
So...

8
00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:03,240
How many have we got?

9
00:01:03,276 --> 00:01:05,543
16 items.

10
00:01:05,582 --> 00:01:09,079
Oh, the station's criminal
element has been busy this week.

11
00:01:09,124 --> 00:01:11,254
Oh, nothing
out of the ordinary.

12
00:01:11,296 --> 00:01:12,663
Three petty thefts

13
00:01:12,699 --> 00:01:14,602
two incidents
of disorderly conduct

14
00:01:14,637 --> 00:01:15,731
one assault...

15
00:01:15,773 --> 00:01:17,538
Ijarna's wife hit him again?

16
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,548
Why does he stay with her?

17
00:01:19,582 --> 00:01:21,450
Skip to item 12.

18
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,619
"Public lewdness."

19
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:27,691
The same night
Ijarna reported the assault

20
00:01:27,735 --> 00:01:31,141
I found him and his wife...

21
00:01:31,176 --> 00:01:35,414
behind the Information Kiosk
on the second level.

22
00:01:35,453 --> 00:01:37,321
That answers my question.

23
00:01:37,358 --> 00:01:39,693
What about item seven?

24
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,063
Ah.

25
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,336
One of my deputies
caught Oguy Jel

26
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:47,645
scrawling political graffiti
on a wall in Section 4.

27
00:01:47,683 --> 00:01:49,654
He's always riled up
about something, isn't he?

28
00:01:49,687 --> 00:01:50,986
What is it this time?

29
00:01:51,024 --> 00:01:53,257
He was protesting
First Minister Shakaar's

30
00:01:53,296 --> 00:01:54,925
upcoming visit to the station.

31
00:01:54,967 --> 00:01:56,767
He's been handing out
leaflets saying

32
00:01:56,804 --> 00:01:59,868
Shakaar should drop the petition
to join the Federation.

33
00:01:59,913 --> 00:02:01,246
Well, leaflets are one thing.

34
00:02:01,283 --> 00:02:02,809
Vandalism is quite another.

35
00:02:02,853 --> 00:02:06,225
Oguy spent a night in a holding
cell for his trouble

36
00:02:06,261 --> 00:02:08,790
and I understand the Arbiter

37
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:12,330
has sentenced him to three weeks
community service...

38
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:14,869
on sanitation duty.

39
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:17,785
Just make sure
he scrubs that wall clean

40
00:02:17,822 --> 00:02:19,052
before Shakaar gets here.

41
00:02:19,091 --> 00:02:20,891
I don't want him to see it.

42
00:02:20,929 --> 00:02:22,991
Right.

43
00:02:23,034 --> 00:02:24,697
I'd like to file a complaint.

44
00:02:24,738 --> 00:02:26,037
Not now, Quark.

45
00:02:26,075 --> 00:02:28,741
A noise complaint against you.

46
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:30,752
We are conducting
station business.

47
00:02:30,786 --> 00:02:32,848
My quarters are right below his.

48
00:02:32,891 --> 00:02:35,328
You wouldn't believe
the racket he makes.

49
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:36,332
Quark!

50
00:02:36,367 --> 00:02:37,495
Do you know what it's like

51
00:02:37,535 --> 00:02:39,369
to hear someone
practice shape-shifting?

52
00:02:39,407 --> 00:02:41,810
Last night, it sounded
like a Takaran wildebeest

53
00:02:41,846 --> 00:02:43,315
was tromping around up there.

54
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:45,411
That was
for all of five minutes.

55
00:02:45,521 --> 00:02:48,653
Once you complained, I took
the form of a Rafalian mouse.

56
00:02:48,696 --> 00:02:52,661
Yeah, little tiny feet
skittering across the floor.

57
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:54,903
Back and forth,
back and forth.

58
00:02:54,944 --> 00:02:56,243
You could hear that?

59
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,442
Hello?

60
00:02:57,483 --> 00:03:00,388
Sometimes I can even
hear him... oozing around.

61
00:03:00,424 --> 00:03:02,189
Well, maybe you should
change quarters.

62
00:03:02,228 --> 00:03:04,860
Maybe he should have
a little more consideration.

63
00:03:04,902 --> 00:03:07,203
Shape-shifting
in the middle of the night...

64
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,643
there ought to be a
regulation against that.

65
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:11,114
Come back in half an hour.

66
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,846
I'll be happy to take
your complaint then.

67
00:03:12,887 --> 00:03:14,220
Oh, I'll be back.

68
00:03:14,257 --> 00:03:15,590
You can count on it.

69
00:03:20,605 --> 00:03:21,801
It's just Quark's luck

70
00:03:21,842 --> 00:03:24,109
that you would be assigned
quarters right above his.

71
00:03:24,147 --> 00:03:27,713
Luck had nothing to do with it.

72
00:03:47,035 --> 00:03:50,031
I don't know why Captain Sisko
insists on having me here.

73
00:03:50,076 --> 00:03:51,409
I'm not a senior officer.

74
00:03:51,446 --> 00:03:53,075
Well, maybe he just
wanted to see you

75
00:03:53,117 --> 00:03:54,279
in your dress uniform.

76
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,846
It does show off your figure.

77
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,884
Why, thank you.

78
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,598
Good of you to make it, old man.

79
00:04:01,637 --> 00:04:03,471
Shakaar's transport just docked.

80
00:04:03,508 --> 00:04:06,072
Sorry. There were so many
people on the Promenade.

81
00:04:06,114 --> 00:04:07,674
It was hard to get through.

82
00:04:07,718 --> 00:04:11,090
I hope Shakaar's gotten better
at speaking in front of groups.

83
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,928
He used to mumble his way
through mission briefings.

84
00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:16,997
Everyone in our resistance cell
had to learn to lip-read.

85
00:04:22,052 --> 00:04:24,023
Welcome to Deep Space 9,
Minister.

86
00:04:24,057 --> 00:04:25,686
Well, thank you, Captain.

87
00:04:25,728 --> 00:04:28,063
I've been looking forward
to visiting the station

88
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,536
and to meeting the Emissary.

89
00:04:29,638 --> 00:04:32,874
Uh... this is part
of my senior staff.

90
00:04:32,913 --> 00:04:34,941
Lieutenant Commander Jadzia Dax.

91
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,147
Chief of Operations
Miles O'Brien.

92
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:40,891
Doctor Bashir, and, of course
you know Major Kira.

93
00:04:40,932 --> 00:04:42,196
Nerys.

94
00:04:42,235 --> 00:04:44,229
Good to see you again, Edon.

95
00:04:44,272 --> 00:04:48,943
Well, I guess I should introduce
my senior staff.

96
00:04:48,984 --> 00:04:50,317
There he is.

97
00:04:50,354 --> 00:04:53,726
Sarish Rez,
the First Minister's adjutant.

98
00:04:53,762 --> 00:04:55,288
A pleasure.
Come this way.

99
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,463
There's quite a crowd
on the Promenade

100
00:04:57,504 --> 00:04:58,598
waiting to see you.

101
00:04:58,641 --> 00:05:00,110
Oh, can't wait.

102
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,480
Why didn't you tell me?

103
00:05:05,523 --> 00:05:06,685
What?

104
00:05:06,727 --> 00:05:08,253
He's so good looking.

105
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:18,982
The guards will escort you
to the podium

106
00:05:19,023 --> 00:05:20,117
whenever you're ready.

107
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:21,355
Don't forget to mention

108
00:05:21,395 --> 00:05:23,593
the transit subsidies
you just allocated.

109
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,569
Tell them they
can expect the price

110
00:05:25,605 --> 00:05:27,735
of transport to Bajor
to start dropping

111
00:05:27,777 --> 00:05:30,271
within a few months,
and remember... enunciate.

112
00:05:30,316 --> 00:05:32,287
Let's go.

113
00:05:32,321 --> 00:05:33,289
Good luck.

114
00:05:33,323 --> 00:05:34,622
Yeah.

115
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,959
Odo to Captain Sisko.

116
00:05:35,997 --> 00:05:37,159
Go ahead, Constable.

117
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,172
I've just received
a disturbing communication.

118
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:43,044
I have reason to believe
someone is planning

119
00:05:43,081 --> 00:05:45,552
to assassinate
First Minister Shakaar.

120
00:07:44,573 --> 00:07:46,407
As far as I'm concerned,
we should have gotten

121
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:48,005
the First Minister
off that podium

122
00:07:48,048 --> 00:07:49,882
as soon as we received
the information.

123
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,323
If Shakaar canceled
his public appearances

124
00:07:52,359 --> 00:07:54,489
every time someone
threatened his life

125
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,330
he would never leave his office.

126
00:07:56,369 --> 00:07:58,567
We're not talking about
some disgruntled shopkeeper

127
00:07:58,607 --> 00:08:00,908
who writes a letter
threatening Shakaar

128
00:08:00,946 --> 00:08:02,347
for raising his taxes.

129
00:08:02,383 --> 00:08:05,151
We're talking about
a Cardassian extremist group

130
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:07,456
that's already succeeded
in assassinating

131
00:08:07,496 --> 00:08:08,931
two Bajoran officials.

132
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:10,834
I know all about "The True Way"

133
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,430
and what they're capable of.

134
00:08:12,473 --> 00:08:15,709
My sources in the Cardassian
civilian government

135
00:08:15,748 --> 00:08:19,052
believe The True Way already
has an operative in place

136
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,058
aboard the station.

137
00:08:20,092 --> 00:08:21,322
I suggest you cancel

138
00:08:21,362 --> 00:08:23,799
the First Minister's conference
and reschedule it

139
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:24,928
at another location.

140
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:25,960
Absolutely not.

141
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,635
Nothing is going to keep Shakaar

142
00:08:27,744 --> 00:08:29,270
from meeting
those delegates tomorrow.

143
00:08:29,314 --> 00:08:31,615
Bajor's effort
to join the Federation

144
00:08:31,653 --> 00:08:34,558
hinges on what happens
over the next few days.

145
00:08:34,593 --> 00:08:36,655
Shouldn't the decision be up
to the First Minister?

146
00:08:36,698 --> 00:08:37,928
It will be.

147
00:08:37,968 --> 00:08:40,668
But I already know
what he's going to say.

148
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,041
So do I.

149
00:08:42,078 --> 00:08:43,342
Shakaar knows better than anyone

150
00:08:43,382 --> 00:08:44,817
you can't capitulate
to terrorists.

151
00:08:44,852 --> 00:08:46,082
He used to be one

152
00:08:46,122 --> 00:08:48,822
and the day the Cardassians
started to negotiate with him

153
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,695
was the day he knew
they'd been beaten.

154
00:08:50,766 --> 00:08:51,791
He'll stay.

155
00:08:51,835 --> 00:08:53,304
I suppose if I were

156
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:55,868
in his position,
I'd do the same.

157
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:59,283
Constable, I want station
security stepped up

158
00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:01,313
for the duration
of Shakaar's visit.

159
00:09:01,358 --> 00:09:04,456
The First Minister will have
round-the-clock protection.

160
00:09:04,498 --> 00:09:07,096
I'd like to deploy
Starfleet Security personnel

161
00:09:07,138 --> 00:09:08,835
in addition to my own deputies.

162
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:09,934
Of course.

163
00:09:09,978 --> 00:09:12,142
Commander Eddington is on leave.

164
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:13,346
I'll ask Mr. Worf

165
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,585
to head up Starfleet Security
while he's gone.

166
00:09:20,136 --> 00:09:23,599
I have cleared the rooms above,
below and to both sides

167
00:09:23,644 --> 00:09:25,204
of the First Minister's
quarters.

168
00:09:25,248 --> 00:09:26,615
I would recommend clearing

169
00:09:26,651 --> 00:09:28,884
that entire section
of the Habitat Ring.

170
00:09:28,923 --> 00:09:31,053
I'm afraid that isn't feasible.

171
00:09:31,095 --> 00:09:33,498
There are over 1,200
people living there.

172
00:09:33,535 --> 00:09:35,972
Providing security
was difficult enough

173
00:09:36,007 --> 00:09:37,408
aboard the <i>Enterprise.</i>

174
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:40,417
It appears to be next
to impossible on this station.

175
00:09:40,451 --> 00:09:41,750
It isn't easy.

176
00:09:41,787 --> 00:09:45,250
I prefer a more...
orderly environment.

177
00:09:45,296 --> 00:09:47,494
We have that in common.

178
00:09:47,535 --> 00:09:50,440
My people have
an innate need for order.

179
00:09:50,476 --> 00:09:52,777
How do you tolerate living here?

180
00:09:52,814 --> 00:09:55,446
I make order where I can.

181
00:09:55,488 --> 00:09:57,755
For one thing,
I have a daily routine

182
00:09:57,793 --> 00:09:59,593
which I follow unwaveringly.

183
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,498
The shopkeepers on the Promenade

184
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:03,665
joke that they can set
their clocks by me.

185
00:10:03,707 --> 00:10:06,008
Unfortunately,
I have found it difficult

186
00:10:06,046 --> 00:10:08,040
to establish a routine here.

187
00:10:08,084 --> 00:10:12,322
There are other ways to create
order in your life...

188
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,762
your quarters, for example.

189
00:10:13,798 --> 00:10:16,235
Everything in mine
has its specific place

190
00:10:16,271 --> 00:10:18,367
and it's all arranged just so.

191
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,742
Yes, mine, too.

192
00:10:19,778 --> 00:10:20,940
Even with my eyes closed

193
00:10:20,982 --> 00:10:22,976
I would still know
where everything was.

194
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,353
Exactly.

195
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,691
I would not tolerate it
any other way.

196
00:10:26,729 --> 00:10:28,062
I'll tell you what else to do.

197
00:10:28,099 --> 00:10:30,036
Make sure everyone knows

198
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:33,168
they can't just drop by
your quarters to say "hello."

199
00:10:33,211 --> 00:10:36,116
If someone does, whatever
happens, don't make them

200
00:10:36,151 --> 00:10:37,210
feel welcome.

201
00:10:37,254 --> 00:10:38,416
Of course not.

202
00:10:38,457 --> 00:10:40,826
That would only invite
subsequent visits.

203
00:10:40,863 --> 00:10:42,230
Precisely.

204
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,362
So far, the only person

205
00:10:44,405 --> 00:10:48,848
that has a tendency to "drop by"
is Chief O'Brien.

206
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:52,516
That's probably because he
knows you from the <i>Enterprise.</i>

207
00:10:52,557 --> 00:10:55,462
Perhaps if I am more...

208
00:10:55,497 --> 00:10:58,664
inhospitable, he will stop.

209
00:10:58,706 --> 00:11:00,506
Good luck.

210
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,814
Odo to Worf.

211
00:11:05,856 --> 00:11:06,824
Go ahead.

212
00:11:06,858 --> 00:11:08,327
The guards are in position.

213
00:11:08,361 --> 00:11:09,796
The corridors
between Shakaar's quarters

214
00:11:09,832 --> 00:11:11,131
and the Wardroom
have been cleared.

215
00:11:11,168 --> 00:11:12,330
Acknowledged.

216
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,604
The First Minister is scheduled
to leave for the reception

217
00:11:14,643 --> 00:11:15,907
in half an hour.

218
00:11:15,947 --> 00:11:18,043
The Wardroom will be scanned
and secured well before then.

219
00:11:21,393 --> 00:11:22,657
You must be Odo.

220
00:11:22,696 --> 00:11:23,721
First Minister.

221
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,292
I was hoping
I'd get to meet you.

222
00:11:25,336 --> 00:11:28,468
I just wish it wasn't
under these circumstances.

223
00:11:28,511 --> 00:11:29,810
We're ready to go.

224
00:11:29,846 --> 00:11:32,113
Well, the reception doesn't
start for another...

225
00:11:32,153 --> 00:11:33,383
I know.

226
00:11:33,421 --> 00:11:34,720
I want to stop by the Promenade

227
00:11:34,758 --> 00:11:35,920
and visit the Temple first.

228
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:38,228
Why wasn't I told about this?

229
00:11:38,267 --> 00:11:40,933
I didn't know myself
until a moment ago.

230
00:11:40,973 --> 00:11:42,340
Is there a problem?

231
00:11:42,377 --> 00:11:45,874
I would have posted extra
security on the Promenade.

232
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:47,947
Oh, well, we'll
just, uh, slip in.

233
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:51,088
I'll stay for a few minutes,
and then we'll slip out.

234
00:11:51,131 --> 00:11:54,867
With all due respect, sir,
now that you're First Minister

235
00:11:54,906 --> 00:11:57,743
you can't slip in or out of bed
without people noticing.

236
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,614
Maybe not, but that doesn't mean

237
00:12:01,656 --> 00:12:04,220
I'm going to stay
in bed all day.

238
00:12:07,403 --> 00:12:09,237
Odo to Worf.

239
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:12,009
There's been a change of plans.

240
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:16,721
I understand you used to work
for the Cardassians

241
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:18,821
when they were running
this station.

242
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:20,994
I was in charge
of keeping order

243
00:12:21,069 --> 00:12:22,436
on the Promenade.

244
00:12:22,473 --> 00:12:25,002
They could have given that job
to one of their own people.

245
00:12:25,113 --> 00:12:27,016
They must have thought
very highly of you.

246
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,018
Humph.

247
00:12:28,053 --> 00:12:29,021
I know Kira does.

248
00:12:29,122 --> 00:12:31,822
She once told me she trusted
you with her life.

249
00:12:31,862 --> 00:12:33,799
Well, I'm gratified
to hear that.

250
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,863
I always found her to be
a good judge of character.

251
00:12:36,907 --> 00:12:38,969
So I'll trust you
with mine, too.

252
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,321
Oh, it's him.

253
00:12:45,594 --> 00:12:46,722
First Minister.

254
00:12:46,764 --> 00:12:48,063
Gentlemen, how are you?

255
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,091
Hi.

256
00:12:54,917 --> 00:12:56,352
How are you today?

257
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,957
Worf to Odo.
We have secured the Temple.

258
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:03,061
I'll try to get him
inside as soon as I can.

259
00:13:04,306 --> 00:13:05,365
Welcome.

260
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:07,038
Pleasure to see you here.

261
00:13:07,146 --> 00:13:08,547
How do you do?

262
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:09,573
Pleasure.

263
00:13:13,763 --> 00:13:15,062
It's nice to meet you.

264
00:13:15,133 --> 00:13:16,693
I appreciate you being here.

265
00:13:16,736 --> 00:13:17,704
Thank you.

266
00:13:17,738 --> 00:13:19,071
Nice to see you.

267
00:14:07,491 --> 00:14:08,949
Is it always like this?

268
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:10,517
It's not often
that people get a chance

269
00:14:10,552 --> 00:14:11,782
to talk to the First Minister.

270
00:14:11,822 --> 00:14:15,160
And besides, have you ever
met a Bajoran who didn't have

271
00:14:15,197 --> 00:14:17,225
a fervent opinion
about everything

272
00:14:17,268 --> 00:14:19,866
from prophetic interpretation
to farm policy?

273
00:14:19,908 --> 00:14:21,776
I guess not.

274
00:14:21,813 --> 00:14:23,578
Is that Vedek Tonsa?

275
00:14:23,617 --> 00:14:26,111
Yes, it is.

276
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:28,560
I hear he's an excellent
springball player.

277
00:14:28,595 --> 00:14:30,395
Oh, the best on the station.
Why?

278
00:14:30,434 --> 00:14:33,066
Well, I think I'll see
if we can arrange a game.

279
00:14:33,107 --> 00:14:34,770
Oh, you better be good.

280
00:14:34,811 --> 00:14:36,178
I'm terrible.

281
00:14:36,214 --> 00:14:38,685
But it will give me
a chance to talk to him

282
00:14:38,719 --> 00:14:41,556
about supporting Shakaar
in the Vedek Assembly.

283
00:14:50,648 --> 00:14:52,846
Do you have to stare like that?

284
00:14:52,887 --> 00:14:55,154
I think it's making
people nervous.

285
00:14:55,193 --> 00:14:56,719
Good.

286
00:14:59,136 --> 00:15:00,469
You know...

287
00:15:00,506 --> 00:15:02,636
I've been meaning to ask you.

288
00:15:02,677 --> 00:15:05,275
Why don't you wear
that belt anymore?

289
00:15:07,288 --> 00:15:08,587
I don't know.

290
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:11,929
It didn't really
serve a purpose.

291
00:15:11,966 --> 00:15:15,600
It's not as if I needed it
to hold my pants up.

292
00:15:15,642 --> 00:15:17,339
I just thought it
looked good on you.

293
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,370
That's all.

294
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,015
Really?

295
00:15:24,496 --> 00:15:25,829
Really.

296
00:15:31,012 --> 00:15:33,279
Well...

297
00:15:33,318 --> 00:15:35,551
if you say so.

298
00:15:42,372 --> 00:15:43,568
Better?

299
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:46,411
Much.

300
00:15:49,557 --> 00:15:51,551
I guess I'll turn in.

301
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,399
Of course.

302
00:15:57,442 --> 00:15:59,413
Good night, Major.

303
00:15:59,446 --> 00:16:00,813
Good night.

304
00:16:04,826 --> 00:16:06,420
Will you excuse me?

305
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,161
Nerys...

306
00:16:09,203 --> 00:16:10,502
where are you going?

307
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,009
You haven't even said hello.

308
00:16:12,044 --> 00:16:13,377
You were so busy.

309
00:16:13,414 --> 00:16:14,974
I didn't want to bother you.

310
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:16,646
You wouldn't be bothering me.

311
00:16:16,688 --> 00:16:18,282
You'd be rescuing me.

312
00:16:18,326 --> 00:16:20,194
That bad?

313
00:16:21,901 --> 00:16:23,234
You have no idea.

314
00:16:23,271 --> 00:16:25,265
Then I supposed now wouldn't
be a good time for me

315
00:16:25,309 --> 00:16:27,405
to give you my opinion
on how Bajor

316
00:16:27,447 --> 00:16:29,645
should be dealing
with the Klingons.

317
00:16:29,686 --> 00:16:31,315
Actually, it would.

318
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:32,485
But not here.

319
00:16:32,526 --> 00:16:34,052
I was joking.

320
00:16:34,097 --> 00:16:35,122
Fine.

321
00:16:36,435 --> 00:16:38,838
We'll talk
about something else.

322
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:41,368
Care for some <i>hasperat?</i>

323
00:16:41,414 --> 00:16:43,179
You know I don't eat.

324
00:16:43,219 --> 00:16:44,244
Have some.

325
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,258
I'm charging by the head
for this little function

326
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:47,761
and you do have a head...

327
00:16:47,796 --> 00:16:49,129
for the moment.

328
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,441
Let's take a walk.

329
00:16:54,478 --> 00:16:55,811
Okay.

330
00:17:02,832 --> 00:17:04,165
Minister?

331
00:17:04,202 --> 00:17:05,637
Uh, we're going
to take a stroll.

332
00:17:05,672 --> 00:17:07,666
If you tell me
where you're going

333
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,077
I'll secure your route.

334
00:17:09,181 --> 00:17:11,049
If I knew
where we were going

335
00:17:11,085 --> 00:17:13,352
it wouldn't be a stroll,
would it?

336
00:17:13,391 --> 00:17:15,088
I suppose not.

337
00:17:15,128 --> 00:17:16,563
I'll escort you.

338
00:17:16,598 --> 00:17:18,626
Fine, but, uh, just you.

339
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,774
Oh, and, uh, don't
stay too close, huh?

340
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:08,785
Let's go.

341
00:18:08,823 --> 00:18:10,122
Where?

342
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,720
Back to my quarters.

343
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,990
This way.

344
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:20,480
I take it the negotiations
aren't going all that well.

345
00:18:20,518 --> 00:18:21,817
How'd you know?

346
00:18:21,854 --> 00:18:24,691
The truth is the Bajorans
are even less successful

347
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:27,530
than most humanoids
at hiding their emotions.

348
00:18:27,568 --> 00:18:30,735
So you're saying it's as plain
as the nose on my face?

349
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,009
I've been working
with the Federation

350
00:18:33,048 --> 00:18:34,381
for a number of years.

351
00:18:34,418 --> 00:18:36,821
They claim to be
open and understanding

352
00:18:36,857 --> 00:18:40,229
but, somehow, they're always
convinced that they're right.

353
00:18:40,265 --> 00:18:42,236
It can be exasperating
at times.

354
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,035
I've been trying to get them
to cut the timetable

355
00:18:44,075 --> 00:18:45,943
for Bajor's admittance
into the Federation by half

356
00:18:45,979 --> 00:18:47,448
but every time
I think I've made them

357
00:18:47,482 --> 00:18:49,612
understand my reasons,
they remind me

358
00:18:49,654 --> 00:18:51,522
that every member
of the Federation

359
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:53,962
has gone through
the same admittance process.

360
00:18:53,998 --> 00:18:56,265
And why should Bajor
be any different?

361
00:18:56,371 --> 00:18:58,274
I can't think
of a single reason.

362
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,278
Unless, of course, you take
into account the effect

363
00:19:00,346 --> 00:19:03,114
that 50 years of occupation
might have on a society.

364
00:19:03,153 --> 00:19:04,816
Thank you.

365
00:19:06,862 --> 00:19:08,890
You know, I've been a soldier

366
00:19:08,934 --> 00:19:11,098
and I've been a politician

367
00:19:11,139 --> 00:19:13,633
and I have to say
I'm beginning to think

368
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,709
that being a soldier was easier.

369
00:19:16,753 --> 00:19:18,245
Ahh...

370
00:19:18,356 --> 00:19:22,263
Well, I'm afraid I don't
know much about politics.

371
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,427
Well, you agree with me.

372
00:19:23,469 --> 00:19:25,565
As far as I'm concerned,
that makes you an expert.

373
00:19:31,855 --> 00:19:35,591
I realize I haven't been
making your job any easier

374
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:36,965
the past few days.

375
00:19:37,001 --> 00:19:39,302
Well, I can't argue with that.

376
00:19:39,407 --> 00:19:41,310
Well, I just want you
to understand

377
00:19:41,412 --> 00:19:43,781
that, uh, I appreciate
your thoroughness.

378
00:19:43,818 --> 00:19:45,721
Thank you.

379
00:19:45,756 --> 00:19:46,746
Yeah.

380
00:19:50,734 --> 00:19:52,033
Odo, uh...

381
00:19:52,071 --> 00:19:56,981
I know that you
and Nerys are friends

382
00:19:57,015 --> 00:19:59,282
and I was wondering...

383
00:19:59,322 --> 00:20:01,793
does she ever talk
to you about me?

384
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:03,764
Of course.

385
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:06,931
She's spoken about you
on more than one occasion.

386
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:10,778
Well, what I mean is, has
she ever said anything to you

387
00:20:10,816 --> 00:20:13,049
that might indicate
that she...

388
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:15,993
thought of me
as more than a friend?

389
00:20:16,028 --> 00:20:18,192
Ah.

390
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,904
Well, let me think.

391
00:20:26,219 --> 00:20:28,417
No.

392
00:20:28,491 --> 00:20:31,089
Oh, I see.

393
00:20:36,209 --> 00:20:40,413
Oh, I've... I've known Nerys
for over ten years.

394
00:20:40,453 --> 00:20:41,786
Uh...

395
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:44,226
I've trusted her with my life

396
00:20:44,263 --> 00:20:46,234
on more than one occasion.

397
00:20:46,267 --> 00:20:47,566
So have I.

398
00:20:47,603 --> 00:20:51,408
She always knew
how to follow orders.

399
00:20:51,447 --> 00:20:53,144
She never complained
when things got rough.

400
00:20:53,184 --> 00:20:54,152
She was a good soldier.

401
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,157
A good friend.

402
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:58,059
But now it's...

403
00:20:58,096 --> 00:20:59,656
it's different.

404
00:20:59,699 --> 00:21:01,362
Is it?

405
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,311
She's still your friend.

406
00:21:04,445 --> 00:21:05,378
I know.

407
00:21:07,219 --> 00:21:09,588
I think I'm falling in love
with her.

408
00:21:11,529 --> 00:21:14,502
Sometimes, I get
the sense that maybe

409
00:21:14,536 --> 00:21:16,973
just maybe...

410
00:21:17,008 --> 00:21:19,776
she feels the same way...

411
00:21:19,815 --> 00:21:21,718
but I could be wrong.

412
00:21:21,753 --> 00:21:24,054
I'm afraid to say anything

413
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,064
because it, it might
ruin our friendship.

414
00:21:27,167 --> 00:21:31,166
But if I don't, I could be
letting something very precious

415
00:21:31,209 --> 00:21:32,906
slip through my fingers.

416
00:21:34,851 --> 00:21:35,876
It's a...

417
00:21:37,624 --> 00:21:39,561
difficult situation.

418
00:21:39,596 --> 00:21:41,122
Yeah.

419
00:21:43,605 --> 00:21:45,405
Well, for all I know

420
00:21:45,443 --> 00:21:48,747
I've gotten myself
all twisted up over nothing.

421
00:21:48,785 --> 00:21:51,417
I mean, if she hasn't
said anything to you

422
00:21:51,457 --> 00:21:54,920
then this whole thing is
probably just inside my head.

423
00:21:56,169 --> 00:21:58,436
Frankly, I think
she's still grieving

424
00:21:58,474 --> 00:22:00,377
for Vedek Bareil.

425
00:22:00,412 --> 00:22:01,847
Oh, of course.

426
00:22:01,883 --> 00:22:03,318
It's only natural.

427
00:22:05,191 --> 00:22:07,389
Maybe I should just be patient.

428
00:22:07,429 --> 00:22:09,593
That's what I would do.

429
00:22:11,606 --> 00:22:13,577
On the other hand

430
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:17,575
maybe I should let
her know how I feel.

431
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,252
It might help her
to get over her loss

432
00:22:20,294 --> 00:22:22,765
if she knew that
there was somebody

433
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,100
who really cared about her.

434
00:22:25,139 --> 00:22:27,474
What do you think?

435
00:22:29,482 --> 00:22:32,786
I'm afraid I know even less
about relationships

436
00:22:32,823 --> 00:22:34,953
than I do about politics.

437
00:22:34,995 --> 00:22:37,125
Well, I understand.

438
00:22:37,167 --> 00:22:39,638
I... I don't mean
to burden you

439
00:22:39,673 --> 00:22:42,373
with my problems.

440
00:22:42,413 --> 00:22:45,318
Talking about
humanoid relationships

441
00:22:45,354 --> 00:22:48,327
can't be
that interesting to you.

442
00:22:48,361 --> 00:22:51,027
For the most part, no.

443
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,337
You don't have to bother.

444
00:23:09,377 --> 00:23:12,373
I can personally vouch
for every one of my employees

445
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:13,820
who had access to that food.

446
00:23:13,855 --> 00:23:14,823
Ha.

447
00:23:14,857 --> 00:23:18,856
I can't tell you
how relieved that makes me feel.

448
00:23:21,874 --> 00:23:25,280
I'm reading some sort
of power signature.

449
00:23:26,318 --> 00:23:27,810
Ah...

450
00:23:30,027 --> 00:23:33,524
A Ferengi eavesdropping device.

451
00:23:33,569 --> 00:23:36,701
I don't suppose you know
anything about this.

452
00:23:36,744 --> 00:23:38,043
Oh! There it is.

453
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,244
I've been looking
for that all day.

454
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:42,152
You admit it's yours?

455
00:23:42,189 --> 00:23:44,023
I must have misplaced it.

456
00:23:44,061 --> 00:23:47,034
I take it you were hoping
to peddle information

457
00:23:47,068 --> 00:23:48,560
about Shakaar's meeting.

458
00:23:48,605 --> 00:23:50,268
Odo, you know
as well as I do

459
00:23:50,309 --> 00:23:53,282
that it's illegal to listen
to someone's conversation

460
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,717
without their consent.

461
00:23:54,753 --> 00:23:56,553
Why else would
someone like you

462
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,925
own such an expensive
listening devise?

463
00:24:00,467 --> 00:24:03,133
I use it to monitor
Rom's sleep.

464
00:24:03,174 --> 00:24:07,742
You see, ever since he was a boy
my brother's had this condition

465
00:24:07,784 --> 00:24:09,778
where he sometimes
stops breathing

466
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,486
in the middle of the night.

467
00:24:11,526 --> 00:24:15,058
The fact is... I can't sleep
unless I know he's all right.

468
00:24:15,101 --> 00:24:17,767
Very touching.

469
00:24:17,808 --> 00:24:19,107
Oh!

470
00:24:19,145 --> 00:24:21,116
How clumsy of me.

471
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,383
You are in a bad mood today.

472
00:24:23,422 --> 00:24:24,686
I don't have moods.

473
00:24:24,725 --> 00:24:25,693
Of course not.

474
00:24:25,727 --> 00:24:27,287
You're an unfeeling changeling.

475
00:24:27,331 --> 00:24:28,800
All you care about is order.

476
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:29,859
That's right.

477
00:24:29,904 --> 00:24:30,894
Oh, please.

478
00:24:30,939 --> 00:24:32,533
I know what's going on.

479
00:24:32,577 --> 00:24:34,946
You don't have to pretend
with me.

480
00:24:34,983 --> 00:24:37,888
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

481
00:24:37,923 --> 00:24:39,415
You're in love with her.

482
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,191
Who?

483
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:42,461
Kira.

484
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:47,309
That's ridiculous!

485
00:24:47,345 --> 00:24:49,646
And what's more, you're worried

486
00:24:49,685 --> 00:24:51,986
she's falling in love
with Shakaar.

487
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:53,493
Is that a fact?

488
00:24:53,527 --> 00:24:54,996
It's the truth.

489
00:24:55,031 --> 00:24:56,762
Why can't you just admit it?

490
00:24:56,802 --> 00:24:58,773
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

491
00:24:58,806 --> 00:25:01,938
Look, Odo, I know
this can't be easy for...

492
00:25:01,981 --> 00:25:04,145
I don't want
your sympathy, Quark

493
00:25:04,186 --> 00:25:06,123
and I don't need your advice!

494
00:25:06,158 --> 00:25:08,152
Just stay out of my business!

495
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:29,376
Computer, time.

496
00:25:29,413 --> 00:25:32,215
0821 hours.

497
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:38,124
I'm sorry I'm late.

498
00:25:38,167 --> 00:25:40,901
I didn't realize
what time it was.

499
00:25:42,277 --> 00:25:43,803
So what do we have?

500
00:25:43,847 --> 00:25:45,818
Nine items.

501
00:25:45,852 --> 00:25:50,227
Well, so far it's all
fairly routine.

502
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:53,702
Something wrong?

503
00:25:54,774 --> 00:25:56,209
Your <i>raktajino?</i>

504
00:25:56,244 --> 00:26:00,015
Oh! I had one this morning
with Shakaar.

505
00:26:01,557 --> 00:26:04,155
I... I didn't see you
in the Replimat.

506
00:26:04,197 --> 00:26:05,723
No, it was in his quarters.

507
00:26:05,767 --> 00:26:07,202
He asked me to look over

508
00:26:07,237 --> 00:26:10,734
a proposal he's going to make
to the Federation delegates.

509
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:12,248
Ahh...

510
00:26:12,282 --> 00:26:14,982
There's an interesting story
behind item four.

511
00:26:15,022 --> 00:26:17,220
And I would love
to hear it, but I'm

512
00:26:17,261 --> 00:26:19,425
a little pressed for time
right now.

513
00:26:19,533 --> 00:26:20,866
Of course.

514
00:26:20,903 --> 00:26:23,374
I promised Shakaar I'd give him
a tour of the station.

515
00:26:23,409 --> 00:26:26,541
I'll make sure
security is in place.

516
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:27,677
Thank you.

517
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,417
See you later.

518
00:26:40,283 --> 00:26:42,652
The Upper Pylons have the
best view of the wormhole.

519
00:26:42,689 --> 00:26:44,056
I've never seen it, actually.

520
00:26:44,092 --> 00:26:46,222
Why don't we wait
a few minutes?

521
00:26:46,264 --> 00:26:47,494
Maybe a ship will go through.

522
00:26:47,533 --> 00:26:48,501
You can see it open.

523
00:26:48,536 --> 00:26:50,233
Well, you're the First Officer.

524
00:26:50,273 --> 00:26:51,241
Can't you...

525
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,179
order a ship through?

526
00:26:53,214 --> 00:26:55,276
Well, you're the First Minister.

527
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:59,557
You should be able to order
a whole fleet through.

528
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,861
The other day,
I heard someone say

529
00:27:02,904 --> 00:27:05,604
that if you happen
to see the wormhole open

530
00:27:05,644 --> 00:27:06,840
you get to make a wish.

531
00:27:06,879 --> 00:27:09,852
Oh. That's been going around
the station for a while now.

532
00:27:09,887 --> 00:27:11,117
Uh-huh.

533
00:27:12,526 --> 00:27:14,086
Look.

534
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,870
Did you make a wish?

535
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:22,707
Yes.

536
00:27:35,415 --> 00:27:36,714
We should get going.

537
00:27:36,751 --> 00:27:38,482
There's a lot more to see.

538
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,899
Odo to Worf.

539
00:27:42,933 --> 00:27:44,266
Go ahead.

540
00:27:44,303 --> 00:27:46,832
We're heading back down
to the Docking Ring.

541
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:48,174
Acknowledged.

542
00:27:48,212 --> 00:27:50,046
Your route has been secured.

543
00:27:50,084 --> 00:27:51,713
Level 2-D.

544
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:53,657
Please enter security code.

545
00:27:57,902 --> 00:27:59,496
You know, I, um...

546
00:27:59,539 --> 00:28:01,874
haven't had a meal
outside the Wardroom,

547
00:28:01,911 --> 00:28:04,816
or my quarters,
since I got here.

548
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:07,916
Well, there's some
pretty nice places to eat

549
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,452
on the Promenade.

550
00:28:09,497 --> 00:28:10,656
You have a favorite?

551
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:12,760
There's a new
Bolian restaurant

552
00:28:12,794 --> 00:28:14,093
that's pretty good.

553
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:16,101
I've never had Bolian food.

554
00:28:16,135 --> 00:28:19,074
Well, this isn't going
to sound very appetizing

555
00:28:19,109 --> 00:28:20,977
but the meat they use is...

556
00:28:21,013 --> 00:28:22,642
sort of... aged.

557
00:28:22,684 --> 00:28:24,244
Aged.

558
00:28:24,288 --> 00:28:25,256
Worf to Odo.

559
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:27,420
A turbolift is stuck
on Level 41.

560
00:28:27,462 --> 00:28:29,991
We are going to have
to reroute you.

561
00:28:30,035 --> 00:28:31,436
Verify your security code

562
00:28:31,472 --> 00:28:33,500
and I'll release the controls
to you.

563
00:28:33,544 --> 00:28:35,275
You don't want to know.

564
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:37,649
Why don't we go
there tonight?

565
00:28:37,686 --> 00:28:39,280
I'd love to.

566
00:28:39,358 --> 00:28:40,725
Great.
How does 1900 hours sound?

567
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:41,751
We can...

568
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,271
We're falling!

569
00:28:45,305 --> 00:28:47,640
Kira to Worf.

570
00:28:50,517 --> 00:28:52,077
Someone cut our com links.

571
00:28:53,257 --> 00:28:55,821
Controls aren't responding.

572
00:29:58,681 --> 00:30:01,050
Well...

573
00:30:01,087 --> 00:30:03,753
I guess this means
my tour is over.

574
00:30:07,369 --> 00:30:09,738
You're telling me
someone overrode

575
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:12,268
the station's com system,
faked Worf's voice

576
00:30:12,314 --> 00:30:14,285
and then sent one
of our turbolifts

577
00:30:14,318 --> 00:30:15,617
into a free fall?

578
00:30:15,654 --> 00:30:17,146
I'm afraid so, sir.

579
00:30:17,192 --> 00:30:19,629
Apparently, they tapped
into the com system

580
00:30:19,664 --> 00:30:21,258
with a voice synthesizer.

581
00:30:21,301 --> 00:30:22,827
What I want to know is

582
00:30:22,872 --> 00:30:25,070
how they got Worf's
security code.

583
00:30:25,111 --> 00:30:27,446
We don't know
that they did that, sir.

584
00:30:27,483 --> 00:30:29,009
What do you mean?

585
00:30:30,424 --> 00:30:32,918
I turned over control
of the turbolift

586
00:30:32,963 --> 00:30:35,492
without verifying his code.

587
00:30:35,536 --> 00:30:38,874
They say to err is human.

588
00:30:38,911 --> 00:30:40,848
But you're not human, Odo.

589
00:30:40,882 --> 00:30:42,351
You're not even humanoid.

590
00:30:42,386 --> 00:30:44,880
And this is not
the sort of mistake

591
00:30:44,925 --> 00:30:47,123
that I'd expect from you.

592
00:30:47,163 --> 00:30:48,963
I...

593
00:30:49,001 --> 00:30:50,527
was distracted.

594
00:30:50,605 --> 00:30:51,869
Distracted?

595
00:30:51,908 --> 00:30:53,537
A personal matter, sir.

596
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:57,017
I'd prefer not to discuss it.

597
00:30:57,054 --> 00:30:58,546
Constable...

598
00:30:58,657 --> 00:31:00,560
whatever this personal matter is

599
00:31:00,662 --> 00:31:03,760
don't let it interfere
with your job again.

600
00:31:03,804 --> 00:31:05,205
I won't, sir.

601
00:31:07,044 --> 00:31:09,538
That's all I need to hear.

602
00:31:10,888 --> 00:31:14,294
Now, no ships have been
allowed to leave

603
00:31:14,328 --> 00:31:15,888
since this incident occurred.

604
00:31:15,933 --> 00:31:17,801
That means whoever
was responsible

605
00:31:17,837 --> 00:31:19,534
is still on the station.

606
00:31:19,642 --> 00:31:21,111
I want them found.

607
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:22,614
Yes, sir.

608
00:31:33,274 --> 00:31:36,076
It appears that they accessed
the turbolift control system

609
00:31:36,114 --> 00:31:37,276
through the ODN relays.

610
00:31:40,123 --> 00:31:42,219
There might be a trace
of the access signal

611
00:31:42,262 --> 00:31:43,788
left in the relays.

612
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,529
If we can isolate it

613
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:48,600
we might be able to follow
it back to the source.

614
00:31:48,644 --> 00:31:50,113
Odo!

615
00:31:50,147 --> 00:31:52,084
Are you listening?

616
00:31:53,322 --> 00:31:55,452
I've heard every word.

617
00:31:55,494 --> 00:31:57,863
Your mind does not appear
to be on its work.

618
00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:01,533
With all due respect, Commander,
you don't know me well enough

619
00:32:01,575 --> 00:32:03,135
to gauge my state of mind.

620
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:04,443
When someone fails

621
00:32:04,483 --> 00:32:06,511
to ask for a security
verification

622
00:32:06,553 --> 00:32:08,524
their state of mind is obvious.

623
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:09,959
Is it?

624
00:32:09,995 --> 00:32:11,259
With all due respect

625
00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:14,033
I do not see how sitting
in a chair, staring at a wall

626
00:32:14,072 --> 00:32:16,943
is going to help apprehend
Shakaar's would-be assassin.

627
00:32:18,215 --> 00:32:19,240
You're right.

628
00:32:19,284 --> 00:32:20,274
It won't.

629
00:32:21,289 --> 00:32:23,760
I'm going to talk to Major Kira.

630
00:32:23,796 --> 00:32:26,963
Why? She already gave
us her statement.

631
00:32:27,003 --> 00:32:28,974
You follow your leads,
Commander.

632
00:32:29,008 --> 00:32:30,067
I'll follow mine.

633
00:32:43,209 --> 00:32:44,803
Jimenez.

634
00:32:47,853 --> 00:32:50,051
What are these men doing here?

635
00:32:50,091 --> 00:32:53,155
First Minister Shakaar's
in Major Kira's quarters, sir.

636
00:32:53,199 --> 00:32:54,691
How long has he been there?

637
00:32:54,803 --> 00:32:56,706
Since they finished dinner.

638
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:58,176
About three hours ago.

639
00:32:58,211 --> 00:33:00,375
All right, Ensign,
you're relieved.

640
00:33:00,417 --> 00:33:03,185
Sir, I'm not scheduled
to go off duty...

641
00:33:03,223 --> 00:33:04,624
I said you're relieved.

642
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,654
I'll take the rest
of your shift.

643
00:33:06,697 --> 00:33:07,687
Yes, sir.

644
00:33:26,913 --> 00:33:28,610
Let's have dinner.

645
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:31,248
Great.
I'll see you then.

646
00:33:33,262 --> 00:33:34,458
Good morning.

647
00:33:34,498 --> 00:33:37,027
May I ask where you're
going, First Minister?

648
00:33:37,071 --> 00:33:38,233
To my quarters

649
00:33:38,274 --> 00:33:40,940
and then to the meeting
in the Wardroom.

650
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,455
Major

651
00:33:46,493 --> 00:33:47,757
I was wondering
if you had a moment

652
00:33:47,796 --> 00:33:49,459
to answer a few questions
about what happened

653
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,468
in the turbolift?

654
00:33:50,503 --> 00:33:51,436
Sure, come on in.

655
00:33:53,343 --> 00:33:54,642
Lights.

656
00:34:05,305 --> 00:34:06,934
Did I do something amusing?

657
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,536
No. It's...

658
00:34:10,952 --> 00:34:12,752
Edon and I...

659
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:14,761
Oh, I understand.

660
00:34:14,861 --> 00:34:16,330
Oh, Odo...

661
00:34:16,365 --> 00:34:18,529
if someone had told me
a year ago

662
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:20,438
that this was going to happen

663
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,343
do you know
what I would have said?

664
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:23,678
"You're crazy.

665
00:34:23,716 --> 00:34:25,744
"Yes, I respect him,
yes, I...

666
00:34:25,787 --> 00:34:28,783
"He makes me laugh, bu-but we
know each other too well.

667
00:34:28,894 --> 00:34:31,492
"I mean, he's seen me
go weeks without a bath.

668
00:34:31,534 --> 00:34:34,371
"We've spent long cold nights
huddled together for warmth.

669
00:34:34,408 --> 00:34:36,379
"There's no mystery left
between us.

670
00:34:36,413 --> 00:34:38,007
We're friends, that's all."

671
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,218
I guess I was wrong.

672
00:34:45,869 --> 00:34:48,033
I'm happy for you.

673
00:34:49,779 --> 00:34:52,809
This must seem so silly to you.

674
00:34:52,852 --> 00:34:54,948
No.

675
00:34:54,991 --> 00:34:56,722
Not in the least.

676
00:35:04,046 --> 00:35:06,951
You are such
a good friend to me.

677
00:35:06,986 --> 00:35:10,290
I'm so glad you're
the first person to know.

678
00:35:11,697 --> 00:35:13,964
Oh, now, um...

679
00:35:14,002 --> 00:35:16,303
you wanted to ask me something

680
00:35:16,342 --> 00:35:19,144
about what happened
in the turbolift.

681
00:35:19,182 --> 00:35:21,746
Yes, but we can talk
about it later.

682
00:35:21,788 --> 00:35:23,121
Oh no, are you sure?

683
00:35:23,158 --> 00:35:24,126
Yes.

684
00:35:24,161 --> 00:35:26,257
I have an appointment.

685
00:35:28,772 --> 00:35:29,934
All right.

686
00:35:49,212 --> 00:35:51,376
Take him to a holding cell.

687
00:35:54,157 --> 00:35:55,421
What'd he do?

688
00:35:55,459 --> 00:35:57,453
He was responsible
for the attack

689
00:35:57,498 --> 00:35:59,092
on First Minister Shakaar.

690
00:35:59,136 --> 00:36:00,298
What?

691
00:36:00,405 --> 00:36:03,242
He has admitted to being
a True Way operative.

692
00:36:03,345 --> 00:36:05,839
They provided him with
an isolinear interface

693
00:36:05,885 --> 00:36:07,252
to access station systems.

694
00:36:07,355 --> 00:36:09,987
He was attempting to use it

695
00:36:10,028 --> 00:36:11,828
to depressurize
Shakaar's quarters

696
00:36:11,865 --> 00:36:15,101
by sabotaging
the environmental controls.

697
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,199
I see.

698
00:36:16,242 --> 00:36:17,836
When he tried to access them

699
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,010
I traced the signal path
back to him.

700
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,020
He was operating

701
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:23,618
out of an abandoned
cargo hold on Level 31.

702
00:36:25,298 --> 00:36:28,761
Why didn't you call me
before you made the arrest?

703
00:36:28,806 --> 00:36:30,275
It was not necessary.

704
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:33,648
Your deputies assisted me
quite capably.

705
00:36:33,685 --> 00:36:35,245
They are well-trained.

706
00:36:35,288 --> 00:36:37,384
You are to be commended.

707
00:37:11,375 --> 00:37:13,778
I know you're in there.

708
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:15,682
I heard you.

709
00:37:17,858 --> 00:37:19,122
Fine.

710
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,222
We'll do this the hard way.

711
00:37:31,857 --> 00:37:34,158
I knew it would come to this.

712
00:37:34,196 --> 00:37:36,167
You take the form
of an animal

713
00:37:36,201 --> 00:37:38,502
you're going to end up
behaving like one.

714
00:37:38,541 --> 00:37:40,272
What was it?
A Klingon <i>targ?</i>

715
00:37:40,311 --> 00:37:41,905
A Trellan crocodile?

716
00:37:44,454 --> 00:37:47,951
I tell you, this time,
you've crossed the line.

717
00:37:47,996 --> 00:37:49,556
I've had it!

718
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:53,372
Odo?

719
00:37:54,478 --> 00:37:55,742
Odo!

720
00:37:55,782 --> 00:37:58,049
Are you okay?

721
00:37:58,087 --> 00:37:59,887
You were right.

722
00:38:01,227 --> 00:38:02,355
Oh.

723
00:38:03,934 --> 00:38:06,600
I take it Major Kira
and Shakaar are...

724
00:38:08,813 --> 00:38:12,345
You really are in love.

725
00:38:12,388 --> 00:38:13,584
I must say

726
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:16,096
I really didn't think
you had it in you.

727
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:19,103
It takes passion
to do something like this

728
00:38:19,137 --> 00:38:21,540
and I always thought
you were colder

729
00:38:21,577 --> 00:38:23,445
than a Breen winter.

730
00:38:23,547 --> 00:38:26,111
What was I thinking?

731
00:38:26,154 --> 00:38:28,352
How could I have fooled myself

732
00:38:28,393 --> 00:38:31,799
into believing she could ever
love someone like me?

733
00:38:31,834 --> 00:38:32,962
Look, uh...

734
00:38:33,004 --> 00:38:34,564
the last thing I want to do

735
00:38:34,608 --> 00:38:36,602
is interfere
with your personal life

736
00:38:36,646 --> 00:38:38,275
but this, uh...

737
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,480
this just isn't any good...

738
00:38:40,555 --> 00:38:43,119
for either of us.

739
00:38:43,162 --> 00:38:46,625
I'll try to keep my problems
more quiet next time.

740
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,196
I'm not talking
about the noise.

741
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,607
I'm talking about business.

742
00:38:49,644 --> 00:38:51,672
I'm losing my shirt
in the manhunt pool.

743
00:38:53,553 --> 00:38:54,521
The what?

744
00:38:54,556 --> 00:38:55,855
Anytime there's an unusual crime

745
00:38:55,892 --> 00:38:57,760
committed on this station,
I run a pool

746
00:38:57,796 --> 00:38:59,994
so that people can bet
on how long it'll take

747
00:39:00,035 --> 00:39:03,099
for you to catch
the perpetrator.

748
00:39:03,143 --> 00:39:04,407
It's very popular.

749
00:39:04,446 --> 00:39:07,476
Frankly, I don't care
whether you and Major Kira

750
00:39:07,587 --> 00:39:09,455
end up living happily
ever after or not.

751
00:39:09,492 --> 00:39:11,793
I just want to see
the situation resolved.

752
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:14,233
And the way I see it

753
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:16,433
you've either got to
tell her how you feel

754
00:39:16,474 --> 00:39:20,439
or forget about her and
get on with your life.

755
00:39:20,484 --> 00:39:24,323
Concentrate on the essentials...

756
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,354
because you can't
keep going like this.

757
00:39:26,398 --> 00:39:27,924
It's interfering with your job

758
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:30,065
and my profits.

759
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:32,405
Your profits.

760
00:39:32,446 --> 00:39:34,508
Unless you do something
about this situation

761
00:39:34,552 --> 00:39:36,546
I'm going to have
to stop running the pool.

762
00:39:36,657 --> 00:39:39,789
I'm devastated.

763
00:39:40,799 --> 00:39:42,234
You should be.

764
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:45,574
The fact that the pool exists
says something about you...

765
00:39:45,644 --> 00:39:47,512
about who you are.

766
00:39:47,549 --> 00:39:51,320
People see you as the guy
who always gets his man.

767
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:55,596
Now, you're becoming the guy
who tears up his quarters

768
00:39:55,702 --> 00:39:57,900
and sits alone in the rubble.

769
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,774
And no one's going
to want to place bets

770
00:39:59,812 --> 00:40:02,410
on how long someone's going
to sit around in the dark.

771
00:40:04,657 --> 00:40:06,183
Well...

772
00:40:06,227 --> 00:40:07,423
I've said my piece.

773
00:40:07,464 --> 00:40:08,831
Sorry for butting in.

774
00:40:10,671 --> 00:40:13,040
But I'm just looking
out for my business.

775
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,050
Funny.

776
00:40:16,084 --> 00:40:18,989
For a minute there, I thought
you were talking to me...

777
00:40:19,025 --> 00:40:20,392
as a friend.

778
00:40:24,203 --> 00:40:26,037
Nah.

779
00:40:46,825 --> 00:40:48,192
Yes.

780
00:40:49,698 --> 00:40:50,997
Good morning, Major.

781
00:40:51,035 --> 00:40:52,060
Oh, come in.

782
00:40:52,104 --> 00:40:54,337
What brings you here?

783
00:40:54,376 --> 00:40:56,745
I wanted to talk to you
about something.

784
00:40:56,782 --> 00:40:58,115
What is it?

785
00:41:00,056 --> 00:41:01,389
I...

786
00:41:01,426 --> 00:41:04,730
don't quite know
how to say this...

787
00:41:07,474 --> 00:41:10,072
but I've given it
a lot of thought...

788
00:41:11,417 --> 00:41:12,545
and, uh...

789
00:41:18,133 --> 00:41:19,602
Well, go on.

790
00:41:21,207 --> 00:41:22,733
Just say it.

791
00:41:27,456 --> 00:41:29,757
I am afraid
I won't be able to make

792
00:41:29,794 --> 00:41:32,288
our Tuesday morning meetings
anymore.

793
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:33,927
Oh.

794
00:41:33,971 --> 00:41:35,167
Why not?

795
00:41:35,207 --> 00:41:37,576
I've decided to schedule

796
00:41:37,613 --> 00:41:40,780
additional training exercises
with my deputies.

797
00:41:40,854 --> 00:41:44,386
Maybe we could have our meetings
at another time.

798
00:41:44,429 --> 00:41:47,699
My schedule is rather tight.

799
00:41:47,737 --> 00:41:49,366
And let's face it

800
00:41:49,407 --> 00:41:53,782
the criminal activity reports
speak for themselves.

801
00:41:53,818 --> 00:41:57,384
There's really no reason
we have to review them together.

802
00:41:57,426 --> 00:42:00,365
Maybe not,
but I kind of enjoyed doing it.

803
00:42:00,401 --> 00:42:02,395
I thought you did, too.

804
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:05,904
Of course.

805
00:42:05,947 --> 00:42:07,712
Odo...

806
00:42:09,657 --> 00:42:11,251
is something wrong?

807
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:15,967
It's just a matter of using
my time more efficiently.

808
00:42:20,114 --> 00:42:21,322
I understand.

809
00:42:22,658 --> 00:42:23,717
Well.

810
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:26,192
Hey.

811
00:42:26,234 --> 00:42:28,034
No belt?

812
00:42:30,377 --> 00:42:33,509
I'm just trying to keep
to the essentials, Major.

813
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,595
See you.

814
00:42:58,377 --> 00:43:00,507
They're upstairs.

815
00:43:00,549 --> 00:43:02,543
Who?

816
00:43:02,588 --> 00:43:04,217
Kira and Shakaar.

817
00:43:04,258 --> 00:43:06,787
They're in Holosuite 3
practicing the speech

818
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:08,892
he's going to give tomorrow
before he leaves.

819
00:43:08,935 --> 00:43:10,302
I hear he's going
to announce

820
00:43:10,405 --> 00:43:12,308
that the Federation has
agreed to cut the timetable

821
00:43:12,377 --> 00:43:13,869
on Bajor's admittance.

822
00:43:13,914 --> 00:43:15,645
Where did you hear that?

823
00:43:15,685 --> 00:43:17,485
Just a rumor.

824
00:43:17,523 --> 00:43:19,323
Are you sure you haven't been

825
00:43:19,361 --> 00:43:21,764
listening in on your holosuites
again?

826
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:23,667
Even if I wanted to,
I couldn't.

827
00:43:23,704 --> 00:43:24,968
I don't have
the right equipment.

828
00:43:25,008 --> 00:43:27,104
Hmm, not anymore.

829
00:43:29,251 --> 00:43:30,743
By the way

830
00:43:30,788 --> 00:43:33,556
I dropped by your quarters
this morning.

831
00:43:33,595 --> 00:43:35,087
Oh?

832
00:43:35,132 --> 00:43:37,603
I heard some noise,
and when I went to complain

833
00:43:37,638 --> 00:43:39,700
I found a work crew

834
00:43:39,743 --> 00:43:41,714
installing soundproofing
in the floor.

835
00:43:41,747 --> 00:43:44,652
I have to say, Odo,
I'm touched that you

836
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:47,320
would do something
like that for me.

837
00:43:47,361 --> 00:43:49,161
I'm having the floor
reinforced.

838
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:51,831
The fact that they're
soundproofing it as well

839
00:43:51,871 --> 00:43:52,839
is incidental.

840
00:43:52,874 --> 00:43:54,036
Mm-hmm.

841
00:43:54,078 --> 00:43:56,549
If you think I'd put up
with three days of construction

842
00:43:56,583 --> 00:43:58,816
for your sake, think again.

843
00:43:58,855 --> 00:44:01,487
I guess I should have known.

844
00:44:01,528 --> 00:44:03,259
Thanks anyway.

845
00:44:03,299 --> 00:44:05,600
Don't mention it.

846
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:07,735
Hmm.

847
00:44:09,915 --> 00:44:11,248
What?

848
00:44:11,285 --> 00:44:12,344
That's what she said.

849
00:44:12,388 --> 00:44:14,188
No! I don't believe it.

850
00:44:14,226 --> 00:44:15,388
Okay, from the beginning.

851
00:44:15,428 --> 00:44:16,590
Tell me the whole thing.

852
00:44:16,631 --> 00:44:18,534
Well, they're either going
to do it, or they're not...
