1
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:05,755
You wanted to see me, Commander?

2
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:09,426
Actually, what I'd like to see
is next month's duty roster.

3
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:14,180
You'll have it on your desk
first thing in the morning.

4
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,891
-That's what you said yesterday.
-I know.

5
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:21,479
-I just spent the whole day yesterday--
-Talking to Minister Rozahn

6
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:23,815
about irrigating the Trilar Peninsula.

7
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,276
How did you know?

8
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:29,154
It's hard to keep a secret in Ops,
especially when you've been shouting

9
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:30,864
at a monitor for the last two days.

10
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:34,659
Thought I kept it down
to an angry whisper.

11
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,995
Let's just say that your voice carries.

12
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:41,124
Every time I talk to one of the ministers

13
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,252
I promise myself,
I'm not going to lose control.

14
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:48,715
But then they give me some stupid
bureaucratic excuse

15
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:51,551
for why something isn't getting done
and I get so...

16
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,678
-So...
-Frustrated.

17
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:57,057
Oh, Commander, I am way beyond frustrated.

18
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,809
Bajor is in trouble. I just want to help.

19
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:04,439
I can understand that, and I sympathize.
As far as I'm concerned

20
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:07,984
you can shout at the provisional
government all you want to as long as

21
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,445
it doesn't interfere
with your duties here on the station.

22
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:13,531
You're right.

23
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,201
I'll get on that report right away.

24
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:22,582
Oh, Major.

25
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,460
Quark's been looking for you.
He says it's urgent.

26
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,170
( sighs ) Perfect.

27
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:33,009
( playing soft, gentle melody)

28
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:51,778
( melody continues )

29
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,163
Huh?

30
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,225
( sniffs )

31
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,948
I hear you've been trying
to get in touch with me.

32
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,533
You hear right.

33
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,245
Look around you.
Does anything seem to be amiss?

34
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:48,084
That sonata Varani is playing is lovely.
Your customers seem to be enjoying him.

35
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:49,377
Why be modest, Major?

36
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,130
They're not just enjoying him
they're mesmerized by him.

37
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,090
-So?
-So, while they're being mesmerized

38
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:57,468
they're not gambling, they're not eating
they're barely drinking.

39
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:02,599
-Profits are down across the board.
-He just started yesterday.

40
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:05,059
I monitor my gross income hourly.

41
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:09,314
My hourly figures become my indicators.
My indicators become my projections.

42
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:13,943
And my projections,
based on the last 26 hours,

43
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,195
show an unprecedented
decline in profits.

44
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,906
Will you stop overreacting.

45
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,699
( sighs )

46
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:23,161
When people hear how wonderful
Varani is they'll come beating

47
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,245
down your door.

48
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:27,582
What are you basing that projection on?
Bajoran intuition?

49
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,752
That and a strip of latinum will get you
a couple of spins at the dabo wheel.

50
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:33,212
You promised me you would
try him out for a month.

51
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,842
If my projections hold true
in a month, I'll be out of business.

52
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,553
Quark, you are going to do this.

53
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:41,596
What for?

54
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,890
Because I asked you to.

55
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,564
Maybe he could play
something with a little more...

56
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:52,899
Bounce to it.

57
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,027
-Bounce?
-For a change of pace.

58
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,155
( music ends, crowd applauds )

59
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,332
That was beautiful.

60
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:14,671
Having my work appreciated again,
I've almost forgotten how it feels.

61
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:18,758
Granted, it's not quite
the exhibition halls you're used to.

62
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:22,220
Ah, one can't be choosy
about performance venues these days.

63
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,556
I just spoke with Quark.
He likes what you're doing

64
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,142
but he's hoping
you'll play a variety of styles.

65
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:32,689
A little less exhibition hall
a little more music hall, is that it?

66
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:34,941
Something like that.

67
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,152
I think I can accommodate him.

68
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,779
WOMAN: Dabo!

69
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:44,826
I'd love to hear you play
in a more appropriate setting.

70
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,621
Have you spoken to Minister Bolka

71
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,457
about my idea
to rebuild the Jalanda Forum?

72
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,001
I mentioned it to him.

73
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,878
He's got a lot on his mind.

74
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,131
You must keep trying.

75
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,509
Bajorans must reclaim
their artistic heritage

76
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:04,929
if they ever hope to regain
their sense of self-worth.

77
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,016
Next time I talk to the Minister
I'll bring it up again

78
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:11,060
but I can't promise anything.

79
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,777
Ah, Major.

80
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,905
-Get everything settled with Quark?
-Oh, that little toad is this far

81
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,657
from doing a 360 out an airlock.

82
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,660
-I'm glad to hear everything went okay.
-Commander, sensors are picking up

83
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,371
elevated neutrino readings.
A ship's coming through the wormhole.

84
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,289
On screen.

85
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,336
Sensors are detecting
four life-forms on board.

86
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,797
I'm reading a plasma leak
in their engine core.

87
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:40,715
Hail them.

88
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:42,967
No response.

89
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,429
The reactor's overheating.
Life support is barely functioning.

90
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,015
-Get them out of there, Chief.
-O'BRIEN: Aye, sir.

91
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,989
I'm Commander Sisko
of the United Federation of Planets.

92
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,201
You've just been beamed aboard
a Bajoran space station.

93
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,869
We don't mean you any harm.

94
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,783
We're going to bring your ship in.
Once it's docked

95
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,786
we'll diagnose its problems
and hopefully fix them.

96
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,705
SISKO: After that, you can be on your way.

97
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,958
I can offer medical assistance
for that wound.

98
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:25,755
{\an8}<i>Oo-mata! Oo-mata! Dongo patar</i>

99
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:29,008
{\an8}<i>-Meeoto fenta! Fenta!</i>
<i>-Naga dentana.</i>

100
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,134
{\an8}<i>Dentana.</i>

101
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:36,933
{\an8}<i>Oobay a-tal? Oobay a-tal.</i>
<i>Keetama sootay.</i>

102
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:40,102
{\an8}<i>Shalanta Skrreea. Skrreea.</i>

103
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,313
{\an8}Does anyone understand
what she's saying?

104
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,190
{\an8}Something must be wrong
with the universal translator.

105
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,107
{\an8}Chief?

106
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:46,734
{\an8}It's working, Commander

107
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,278
{\an8}but for some reason,
it's having a hard time

108
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,613
{\an8}analyzing their language patterns.

109
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,533
{\an8}Their syntax
and their grammatical structure

110
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,118
{\an8}must be completely unlike
anything in our database.

111
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,579
{\an8}We'll have to keep them talking
until the computer

112
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,706
{\an8}can establish a translation matrix.

113
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:04,877
{\an8}<i>Ketoh maseeca. Skrreea. Tolak mayssefaka.</i>

114
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,420
{\an8}<i>Koo samek.</i>

115
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,381
{\an8}<i>Gadoux besoolin fenta.</i>

116
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:09,423
{\an8}<i>Fenta?</i>

117
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,801
{\an8}Keeping them talking shouldn't be much
of a problem.

118
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:15,680
{\an8}<i>Oobay a-tal?</i>
<i>Fisdak setoma meeka?</i>

119
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,433
{\an8}Major, we've got to get them
down to the Infirmary.

120
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:24,355
{\an8}They seem to be most comfortable with you.
Why don't you lead the way?

121
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,232
{\an8}A-All right.

122
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:31,070
{\an8}Um... we're going to take a little ride
on the turbolift.

123
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,702
{\an8}Toma. Bessa.

124
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,164
{\an8}Sisko to Odo.

125
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:43,624
{\an8}ODO:<i> Yes, Commander.</i>

126
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,042
{\an8}We're bringing some new arrivals

127
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,961
{\an8}from the Gamma Quadrant
down to the Promenade.

128
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,421
{\an8}Meet us at Turbolift 9.

129
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,339
{\an8}<i>I'm on my way.</i>

130
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:00,266
We're here.
You can come out now.

131
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:06,397
There's no need to be afraid.
Come on. It's all right.

132
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:09,650
-What seems to be the trouble, Commander?
-The computer's having a hard time

133
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:10,860
translating their language.

134
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,322
-I can see how that would be a problem.
-KIRA: It's okay.

135
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,615
Come on.

136
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:39,722
ODO: Hold on!
Let's stick together. No wandering off.

137
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:43,601
Now you just stay put
while I round up your friend.

138
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:44,935
Uh, let me try.

139
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,730
Come with me.

140
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,490
Hello.

141
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,994
<i>Intaowa. Intaowa.</i>

142
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,705
Dress. It's called a dress.

143
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:06,749
<i>Intaowa.</i>

144
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,292
<i>Intaowa?</i>

145
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,295
Uh, I'm afraid
you'll have to put that back.

146
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,799
<i>-Vala. Vala!</i>
<i>-Intaowa!</i>

147
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,217
Do you like it?

148
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,346
Yes, it's very nice, but it's not yours.
And that, that goes for you, too.

149
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,305
SISKO: Major

150
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,307
perhaps you'd better handle this.

151
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,936
All right.
Let's put those back, both of you.

152
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:32,441
They really need to put those back.
We can go shopping later

153
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:35,528
but right now, it's very important
that we go to the Infirmary.

154
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:39,532
So, everyone, follow me.
We'll all go together.

155
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:40,866
<i>Fazeek.</i>

156
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,160
<i>Cromay fazeek!</i>

157
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:54,463
<i>Kootana.</i>

158
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,840
<i>Kootana batoo</i>
<i>lakar asheem!</i>

159
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,425
<i>Dokka! Pestani voe lakar asheem.</i>

160
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,342
<i>Kolat kee!</i>

161
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,886
Hmm, there's no doubt who the boss is.

162
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:02,179
How bad is it, Doctor?

163
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,432
Looks like a second-degree plasma burn.

164
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,144
The dermal re generator
should take care of it.

165
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,395
( grunts )

166
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,274
I'm sorry. I'm not the doctor.

167
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,192
<i>Kolat gadoux?</i>

168
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,819
I assure you...

169
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,449
-I will not hurt him.
-He's going to be all right.

170
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,999
These will be your quarters
while you're here at the station.

171
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:34,086
I'm sure you want to rest
and clean up and... you don't understand

172
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,671
anything I'm saying, do you?

173
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,301
I know something
they might understand.

174
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,596
Seven maaza stalks.

175
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:53,856
This is food.

176
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,609
SISKO: Please, try one.

177
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:02,031
Major, show them it's okay.

178
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:05,993
See.

179
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:08,787
Mmm.

180
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,081
Mmm, it's really very good.

181
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,153
Mmm...

182
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,072
I'm glad you like them.

183
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,200
<i>Naloux bataak rama setta.</i>

184
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,369
<i>Rama emal jeetaka.</i>

185
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,788
<i>Zoola koo.</i>

186
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,623
<i>Gadoux soka gee.</i>

187
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,750
I'm sorry, I still don't understand.

188
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,168
<i>Bataak rama setta.</i>

189
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,753
<i>Rama setta.</i>

190
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:01,090
<i>Zoola koo. Hemena kee.</i>

191
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,759
<i>Soulak.</i> Need <i>ikstassa.</i>

192
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:04,802
ODO: Wait.

193
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:05,886
Did you hear that?

194
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,346
I think she said "need."

195
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,056
Go on, keep talking.

196
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:11,767
<i>Ganoux.</i>

197
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,979
<i>Noloux bataak rama setta.</i>

198
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,648

00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:18,857
<i>Skrreea.</i>

200
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,110
<i>Havou fotar</i> save them.

201
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,695
Save them? How?

202
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,865
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Keep talking.

203
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,575
<i>Noloux Skrreea.</i>

204
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,660
<i>Soka roo </i>need your help.

205
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:33,664
There's no time <i>soulak.</i>
We are the <i>Skrreea.</i>

206
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:37,543
My people need your help.
There's no time to waste.

207
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,545
Your people are the Skrreea.
You need our help.

208
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,297
There's no time to waste.

209
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,300
Your people, where are they?

210
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,303
They are on the <i>creshnee</i> side of the Eye.

211
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,972
-The "Eye?"
-The Eye of the Universe.

212
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:51,682
The tunnel.

213
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,518
I think she means the wormhole.

214
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:58,898
They are on the other side.
They don't realize we found the Eye.

215
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,525
How many people are we talking about?

216
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,361
Many... three <i>jeetaka.</i>

217
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,823
Three hundred? Three thousand?

218
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,701
Three million?

219
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:12,703
Three million.

220
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,706
Three million of my people
are on the other side.

221
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:20,336
We must bring them through the Eye.
We must bring them here.

222
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,727
I--Is there anything wrong?

223
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,813
I'm just not used to the men being here.

224
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,484
Skrreean men don't involve themselves
in situations like this.

225
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,195
-Are all your leaders women?
-Yes.

226
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,198
-All of them?
-You heard her, Julian.

227
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,325
Men are far too emotional to be leaders.

228
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,535
They're constantly
fighting among themselves.

229
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,163
It's their favorite thing to do.

230
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,793
I'm sorry.
I hope I haven't offended anyone.

231
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,673
Sorry to keep you waiting.

232
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,967
It's all right, Benjamin.
Haneek was just telling us

233
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,844
how the Skrreea
are a female-dominant society.

234
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,722
It seems the men
are a bit too emotional to be leaders.

235
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:17,351
Please do not misunderstand.
We love our men.

236
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,312
Really.

237
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,817
Are you one of the leaders
of your people, Haneek?

238
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,653
Me? Oh, no.

239
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,740
I'm little more than a farmer.
I was just lucky.

240
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:33,659
How so?

241
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:37,079
I was the first one to find
the Eye of the Universe.

242
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,415
You were looking for the wormhole?

243
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,126
We had heard about a great
tunnel being discovered.

244
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,963
We knew it must be the Eye of the Universe
that would lead us to Kentanna.

245
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:47,965
Kentanna?

246
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,510
Kentanna is the legendary
home of the Skrreeans.

247
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,471
It has always been portrayed
in our sacred texts

248
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,433
as being just beyond
the Eye of the Universe.

249
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:01,979
A planet of sorrow, where the Skrreean
will sow seeds of joy.

250
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,732
I can't guarantee you'll find Kentanna.

251
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,860
But I can promise you
that we'll help you find a home.

252
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:09,987
We sent our runabouts

253
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,239
to the Gamma Quadrant
to make contact with your ships.

254
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,158
That will be difficult.

255
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:17,286
They're all spread
out looking for the Eye.

256
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:22,791
And when we find them, what then?
This station only holds 7,000 people.

257
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,170
You're talking about
three million Skrreeans.

258
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,466
I'm afraid most of your people
will have to be confined to their ships.

259
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,218
-I understand.
-In the meantime,

260
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,721
is there any one person
we should be looking for?

261
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,598
A leader or leaders?

262
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:41,101
Most of our leaders
were killed by the T-Rogorans.

263
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:43,312
The T-Rogorans. Who are they?

264
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,065
For eight centuries,
my people have lived under their rule.

265
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,193
We have been forced to work
as laborers and servants.

266
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:53,238
We were able to escape when the T-Rogorans
were invaded and conquered.

267
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,990
Who conquered them?

268
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,533
I do not know their name.

269
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:01,163
I only know they were members
of something called "The Dominion."

270
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,212
( door chimes )

271
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,257
( sighs )

272
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,891
-Did I wake you?
-Oh, that's all right.

273
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,811
Please, come in. Computer, lights on full.

274
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,063
-I can come back.
-No.

275
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:31,276
You've been so kind to me.
How could I possibly refuse your company?

276
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,159
Go back to bed.
Go on! Go on.

277
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,994
I'll join you again after I'm through.

278
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:48,168
Are those your husbands?

279
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,962
Hus-bands?

280
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:54,133
I'm not familiar with that word.
They're bonded to me.

281
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,011
Do you sleep with them both?

282
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,390
Of course.
Don't you sleep with your males?

283
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,350
No, I don't have any males.

284
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,021
Not at the moment, anyway.

285
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,566
They're very useful.

286
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,318
Yes, I can imagine they are.

287
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:17,739
I just wanted to tell you,
we found some of your ships.

288
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,784
Several hundred Skrreeans should
be arriving at the station today.

289
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,703
We thought it would be a good idea

290
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,496
if you were there to greet them.

291
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,540
Why me?

292
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,209
You yourself said most
of your leaders were dead.

293
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:34,423
Yes, that's true, but, Kira,
I'm just a farmer.

294
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,259
You also were the first one
through the Eye of the Universe.

295
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:41,680
That's got to mean something...
in some symbolic, sort of way.

296
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:42,890
( sighs )

297
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,810
Oh, here.

298
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,230
I brought you something.
Go ahead, open it.

299
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,029
You seemed to like it.

300
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,328
I'm sorry.

301
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,956
I think you misunderstood.

302
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:09,958
What do you mean?

303
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:14,880
I thought this was the most
hideous thing I'd ever seen.

304
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,508
Well, that makes two of us.

305
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:23,972
-It's awful.
-It's horrible.

306
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,601
Who would wear that?

307
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,034
JAKE: It was no big deal.

308
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:47,204
NOG: You go on a date
with a dabo girl for the first time

309
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,665
and you sit there and tell me
it was no big deal?

310
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,083
It wasn't really a date.

311
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,168
Does your father know
you went out with her?

312
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,754
-Not exactly.
-He doesn't?

313
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,340
I told him I had to help
someone with her homework.

314
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,716
Good thinking.

315
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,052
Too bad I'll never
be able to use that lie.

316
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,180
-My dad knows I never do homework.
-It's not a lie, Nog.

317
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,433
Mardah's studying entomology.
She asked me to help her out.

318
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:12,354
A dabo girl who studies entomology?
Ha! Sure.

319
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,480
It's true.

320
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:14,398
Yeah.

321
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,486
What is entomology?

322
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,071
The study of bugs.

323
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,907
Oh, you mean she wants to be a chef?

324
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:27,953
Hey, who's that?

325
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:29,329
NOG: I don't know.

326
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:36,003
What's he doing? Oh, that's disgusting!

327
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:39,923
He must be one of those Skrreeans.
My dad says there's a lot more on the way.

328
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,136
Hi!

329
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,765
Doesn't he know what a replicator's for?

330
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:49,933
Idiot!

331
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:54,688
So, does Mardah
have any sisters?

332
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,738
O'BRIEN: Commander
I've cleared the Skrreean ship

333
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:03,905
to dock at Upper Pylon 2.

334
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:08,160
It's time to welcome your people
to the Alpha Quadrant, Haneek.

335
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:24,051
HANEEK: Come along, don't be afraid.

336
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:27,721
Come on, it's all right.
You're among friends.

337
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:31,016
Don't be afraid.
It's all right.

338
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:32,726
It's all right.

339
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,813
( astonished murmuring )

340
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,356
Slow down!
There's no running on the Promenade.

341
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:22,484
It's going to get awfully crowded
around here, Commander.

342
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:25,737
I know, Constable, but it's worth it.
Just look at them.

343
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,324
They're experiencing
their first taste of freedom.

344
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,461
-JAKE: Nog, where you going?
-Can't talk now. Gotta run!

345
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:42,379
Nog!

346
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:45,715
You know there's no running
on the Promenade.

347
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:46,800
Who's running?

348
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,096
-What seems to be the problem here?
-What's that smell?

349
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,348
-Ask him.
-Me?

350
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:54,558
You're the one who stinks.

351
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,601
That's because you sprayed
that vapor on us.

352
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,186
Is that true, Nog?

353
00:23:58,687 --> 00:23:59,771
No!

354
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:01,898
Nog...

355
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,734
It was a joke.

356
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,070
Very amusing.

357
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:09,739
Thank you for bringing
this to my attention.

358
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,324
I'll take care of it from here.

359
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:12,701
( squealing )

360
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,330
This isn't over yet, big ears.

361
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,249
( panting )

362
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,417
( growling )

363
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,713
( exhales deeply )

364
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,720
Hey, here's a new one.

365
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:37,809
-What kind of name is "Plix Tixiplik?"
-I believe he's a Reegrunion.

366
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:44,399
"Wanted in seven star systems
for illegal weapon sales."

367
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,695
Weapon sales, huh? Very profitable.

368
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:52,949
-How would you know about that?
-My Uncle Quark told me.

369
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:58,455
And what would your Uncle Quark
know about illegal weapon sales?

370
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:01,166
He, uh... he, uh...

371
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:05,503
Knows better than to ever
get involved in anything so disreputable.

372
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:06,671
ODO: I'm sure.

373
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,592
I asked that
the boy's father come to see me.

374
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:14,638
Rom is doing the weekly stock inventory.
I don't want to interrupt him.

375
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:18,600
You know how easy he loses count.
So, I came in his place.

376
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:22,187
Nog, have you been causing mischief again?

377
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:24,439
No, Uncle. It's all a misunderstanding.

378
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:28,109
He sprayed several Skrreean boys
with a foul-smelling vapor.

379
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,695
-Did he?
-( laughing nervously )

380
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,948
What do you have to say for yourself?

381
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,408
I--I'm sorry?

382
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,702
You see the boy's beside
himself with guilt.

383
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:42,249
-That doesn't excuse his actions.
-And he will be punished severely.

384
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,583
I will?

385
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:48,964
I want you to tell the Constable here
that you will never do it again.

386
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:50,632
I won't?

387
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:55,637
I mean, I won't.
I promise. Never again.

388
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,305
See that you don't.

389
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:00,141
Can I leave now?

390
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,437
Go on.

391
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:10,902
You know, you really can't blame the boy.

392
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:13,780
-And why is that?
-Oh, come on, Odo.

393
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:16,574
You know these Skrreeans
are nothing but trouble.

394
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,368
They're all over the station

395
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:22,372
looking and touching,
never buying anything.

396
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:25,250
-And they flake.
-I didn't notice.

397
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:29,129
Come to my place.
You'll see little pieces of Skrreean skin

398
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:32,215
all over the bar and the floor.
It's disgusting.

399
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,968
-Well, they won't be here long.
-I hope not.

400
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,970
They're driving my paying customers away.

401
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,055
They stay here too long,
and I'll be out of business.

402
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:42,267
In that case,
I hope they never leave.

403
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,441
( scoffs )

404
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,192
( excited chatter )

405
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,778
( wind instrument playing softly )

406
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:08,793
We've talked it over among ourselves.
Our feelings were unanimous.

407
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:12,797
You discovered the Eye of the Universe.

408
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:18,136
You must lead us the rest of the way.

409
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:26,227
I'll do the best I can.

410
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:40,408
That looked serious.

411
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,371
Is everything all right?

412
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,248
Look at them.

413
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,085
Look at my people.

414
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:54,464
I've never seen them so happy

415
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:58,968
and here I sit, feeling trapped.

416
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:00,553
Why?

417
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:04,224
They expect me
to lead them to Kentanna.

418
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,893
( music ends, crowd applauds)

419
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,269
It's going to be okay.

420
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:13,024
Commander Sisko is doing everything
he can to find you a place to live.

421
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,151
You're not alone.

422
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:17,112
I hope I'm not intruding.

423
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:18,905
Oh, not at all.

424
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:23,785
Haneek, this is Varani, a great musician.
Maybe the greatest Bajor has ever known.

425
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:28,248
She exaggerates
but that's why I'm so fond of her.

426
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:31,751
Being a Bajoran

427
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,213
I know what it's like to be displaced.

428
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,633
As a token of friendship

429
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,678
I would like to give you this.

430
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,642
( playing quiet melody )

431
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:53,773
It's from a concert I played
many years ago at the Jalanda Forum.

432
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,374
-Tumak, where have you been?
-Nowhere.

433
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,126
-Where are you going?
-To wash.

434
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,430
Computer...

435
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,768
Please show me a chart
of this star system.

436
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,112
-So, what'd your dad say?
-About what?

437
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,822
About you getting in trouble with Odo.

438
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,074
-He was very angry.
-He was?

439
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,910
He always gets angry
when I get caught.

440
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:53,500
( gasping ) I just remembered.
I have some errands to run for my uncle.

441
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,752
You're going to have to face them
sooner or later.

442
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,296
That was very funny, what you did.

443
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:02,801
You see, Jake?
There's a man with a sense of humor.

444
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,637
Nobody's laughing.

445
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,555
And luckily nobody got hurt.

446
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:10,683
I think my friend's real sorry
for what he did.

447
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:13,895
Aren't you?

448
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,231
I suppose.

449
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,525
See? What'd I tell you?

450
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:21,069
He doesn't sound sorry to me.

451
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,825
( squealing )

452
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,545
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

453
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:43,383
That's enough. Break it up.
I said, break it up!

454
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,095
( snarling )

455
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,012
( growls )

456
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,599
It's bad enough you're all hanging
around the station

457
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,352
without buying anything.
You have to start fighting, too?

458
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:56,646
I thought we were welcome here.

459
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:59,607
Well, make yourself
welcome somewhere else.

460
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:01,860
You don't want us here.

461
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,779
You don't want anything to do with us.

462
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,073
Well, we don't want
anything to do with you.

463
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:09,576
Any of you!

464
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:10,994
( <i>yells </i>)

465
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:12,370
( <i>hisses </i>)

466
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,791
QUARK: I can see the Skrreeans

467
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:19,168
don't bother to teach
their children manners.

468
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,253
( <i>hisses </i>)

469
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,591
SISKO: Dax and I have been
combing through data on every uninhabited

470
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,175
M-Class planet in the sector.

471
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,552
We think that Draylon II

472
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:29,470
would make a perfect home
for the Skrreea.

473
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:33,224
Draylon II? I've never heard of it.

474
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,561
It's near Sefalla Prime.
It's got definite possibilities.

475
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:41,107
Stable orbit, temperate climate
and a very low surface radiation.

476
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:44,235
Add to that good soil
and a long growing season.

477
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:46,487
I think it's our best bet.

478
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:52,160
( door chimes )

479
00:31:58,207 --> 00:31:59,792
-May we come in?
-Of course.

480
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:10,637
Ladies.

481
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:17,518
Forgive them, Commander Sisko.
They don't mean any disrespect.

482
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:18,728
I understand.

483
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,690
We have some encouraging news.
We think we've found a planet

484
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,318
for you and your people,
one with excellent potential

485
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:26,319
for resettlement.

486
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:34,744
We appreciate all your hard work
but I'm afraid it was unnecessary.

487
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,121
You see, we found Kentanna.

488
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,374
You did?

489
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,585
A planet of sorrow, Kira.
Don't you see?

490
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:47,966
Kentanna is your planet.
Kentanna is Bajor.

491
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,062
SISKO:<i> Station Log, Stardate 47391.2.</i>

492
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:03,731
<i>Chief O'Brien is continuing </i>
<i>to oversee repairs</i>

493
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,984
<i>to the Skrreean ships docked</i>
<i>at the station.</i>

494
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,695
<i>Meanwhile, Minister Rozahn</i>
<i>and Vedek Sorad have arrived</i>

495
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:12,824
<i>from Bajor with an official response</i>
<i>to the Skrreeans' request to immigrate.</i>

496
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:15,994
-Major, if I may have a moment?
-I'm sorry, Varani.

497
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,662
I'm on my way to a meeting.

498
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:20,123
I know, with Minister Rozahn
and Vedek Sorad.

499
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:23,710
-I presume Haneek will be there as well.
-That's right.

500
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:27,088
Please tell here that my heart
goes out to her and her people.

501
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:31,968
Tell her how much Bajorans everywhere
regret having to refuse their request.

502
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:35,138
-Aren't you being a little premature?
-Am I? You know what

503
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:37,390
the provisional government's answer
is going to be.

504
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:40,226
These are people
who have lost everything, Varani.

505
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:43,479
I know, and I wish there was some way
we could help them.

506
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:49,694
But Bajor is in shambles, Kira.
You know that as well as I do.

507
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:55,908
First of all, I want you all to know

508
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:58,786
that the provisional government
has taken the Skrreeans' request

509
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,998
for immigration very seriously.

510
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:06,461
The debate in the Chamber of Ministers
became quite heated at times.

511
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:10,048
Though I suppose you could
say that about all of our debates.

512
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,883
But a decision was reached?

513
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:15,219
Yes, I was sent here to tell you

514
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,930
that the Ministers, in accord
with the Vedek Assembly,

515
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,184
have decided
to deny the Skrreeans' request.

516
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,311
ROZAHN: I am sorry.

517
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,690
Bajor simply cannot absorb
three million refugees

518
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:28,900
at this time.

519
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:31,444
After what the Cardassians
did to our planet

520
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,446
we can barely take care of our own.

521
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:36,032
But no one is asking
you to take care of us.

522
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:37,909
This decision is not based

523
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:41,162
strictly on Bajoran self-interest.

524
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:44,457
Such a huge increase in population

525
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,168
would prove to be tragic
to your people as well as ours.

526
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,670
But Bajor has more than enough
room for us.

527
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:53,299
The plains of the Northwest Peninsula
are practically uninhabited.

528
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:54,884
The land's ideal for farming.

529
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:56,803
It used to be

530
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,347
before the Cardassians
got their hands on it.

531
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:03,309
Minister Rozahn,
the Skrreea are farmers.

532
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:05,019
Just give us the land.

533
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,939
I guarantee you,
we can make it thrive again.

534
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:11,317
Under ideal circumstances,
perhaps you could.

535
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,487
But what if the circumstances
aren't ideal?

536
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,240
What if we go through
another long winter?

537
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,117
What if your crops fail?

538
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:20,701
What if the famine

539
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:23,162
that has been plaguing Bajor
continues to spread?

540
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:24,705
What then?

541
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,500
We are willing to take that risk.

542
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:28,876
ROZAHN: I'm afraid we aren't.

543
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,753
We ran a series of projections

544
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:33,005
to see whether a Skrreean
settlement could survive

545
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,507
on the Northwest peninsula.

546
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,552
The results were not encouraging.

547
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:39,512
SISKO: Haneek?

548
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,472
I think you should seriously consider

549
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,224
Draylon II as an alternate to Bajor.

550
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,561
The winters are mild.
There's plenty of good farmland.

551
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:49,522
No! Projections can be wrong.

552
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,066
SORAD: But what if they're not?

553
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,695
What is Bajor to do if your people
start dying?

554
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:59,282
I thought I made that clear.
We are not expecting your help.

555
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:02,869
Do you really think we could
stand by and do nothing?

556
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:06,539
We would feel obligated to help
with food, with clothing

557
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:10,376
-with whatever it would take.
-And where would that aid come from?

558
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,753
SORAD: Our resources are already depleted.

559
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:16,507
To help you would mean
depriving our own people.

560
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:20,678
I am afraid the decision
of the provisional government is final.

561
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:24,348
The Skrreea will have to find somewhere
else to live.

562
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:30,021
Please, talk to them.

563
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:31,647
Tell them they're wrong.

564
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,276
Help us.

565
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:40,031
I can't.

566
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:43,743
I'm sorry, Haneek...

567
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,871
But they're right. I wish they weren't.

568
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,290
I wish Bajor was Kentanna.

569
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,376
But it's not.

570
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,674
There's still Draylon II.

571
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,061
Oh!

572
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,646
Look at this!

573
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,653
Excuse me.

574
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,990
If you like cake
the icoberry torte is really good.

575
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,743
Is that big-eared troll
really your friend?

576
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,662
-Yeah.
-He's an idiot.

577
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,664
You're not the first to say that.

578
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:32,333
But he's not such a bad guy
once you get to know him.

579
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,127
I don't plan on being
around here that long.

580
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,506
My dad says you're probably
going to Draylon II.

581
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:39,423
Does he?

582
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,592
Yeah, sounds like a nice place.

583
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,469
Do you want to move there?

584
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:44,595
No.

585
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:46,806
Neither do I.

586
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,689
( door chimes )

587
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:56,023
Come in.

588
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,032
Haneek...

589
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:09,954
The thing I don't understand
is why you pretended

590
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,205
to be my friend.

591
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:12,999
I wasn't pretending.

592
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,293
Ah!

593
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,169
So you are my friend...

594
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,505
Until I need you.

595
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:28,139
I know it's hard for you to see right now
but I am trying to help.

596
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,850
I think I've had quite enough
of your help.

597
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:32,810
You've got to believe me.

598
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:35,146
Commander Sisko has found
you a wonderful home.

599
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:37,648
You betrayed me, Kira.

600
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,358
No, I didn't.

601
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,570
I honestly believe
the provisional government

602
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,821
made the right decision

603
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,823
both for Bajor and the Skrreeans.

604
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:49,285
If that's true,
we have nothing more to discuss.

605
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:55,750
I was hoping we could still be friends.

606
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,295
So in other words, you came here
looking for forgiveness.

607
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,466
Well, I don't forgive you.

608
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:07,470
<i>Sisko to Kira.</i>

609
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,597
Go ahead, Commander.

610
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:10,639
<i>Is Haneek with you?</i>

611
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:11,932
Yes.

612
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:15,603
<i>I need both of you in Ops immediately.</i>
<i>Tumak has taken a ship.</i>

613
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:16,854
<i>He's headed for Bajor.</i>

614
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:37,458
-They're not responding, sir.
-Keep trying, Mr. O'Brien.

615
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,376
How did this happen?

616
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,711
With all the traffic around the station

617
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,838
Tumak and two of his friends
were able to slip away.

618
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:46,175
We didn't even know the ship was gone
until the Bajorans contacted us.

619
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:49,220
Haneek, I need for you
to try to talk to your son.

620
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:51,931
There's a high-energy radiation
leak in the port nacelle.

621
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,975
I've tried to make him aware of it
but he refuses to acknowledge us.

622
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,770
Major, open a channel
to the Skrreean vessel.

623
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,021
Yes, sir.

624
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,441
Ready.

625
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:06,737
Tumak?

626
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:09,824
Listen to me.

627
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,536
Your ship's in danger.

628
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:17,123
( quietly ) Have him turn off
his engines and drift

629
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,999
until the Bajorans can tractor him in.

630
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:23,087
Tumak, turn off your engines.

631
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:27,091
You must turn your engines off, now!

632
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:29,802
He's not responding.

633
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:32,847
Tumak, this is serious!

634
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,557
Your life is in danger.

635
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:37,059
The others who are with you,
their lives are in danger.

636
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:39,603
Please! Answer me!

637
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:41,105
( console beeping )

638
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,775
Sensors are detecting two Bajoran vessels
closing in on the Skrreean ship.

639
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:49,196
Display it here. Mr. O'Brien,
patch us into the Bajoran interceptor.

640
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,406
O'BRIEN: Aye, sir.

641
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,324
<i>BAJORAN: Entered restricted space.</i>

642
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,368
<i>You must turn around</i>
<i>and leave immediately.</i>

643
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:55,619
Open a channel.

644
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:58,330
This is Major Kira
Nerys on Deep Space 9.

645
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,958
The Skrreean vessel has refused
to acknowledge our hails.

646
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:03,252
Communications may be down.
You have to let them land.

647
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,172
<i>That's impossible, Major.</i>
<i>We have strict orders</i> <i>not to allow</i>

648
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:07,548
<i>any Skrreean vessel to land.</i>

649
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:09,091
The pilot's just a boy.

650
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:11,969
He took the ship without permission.
It's barely operational.

651
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:14,013
KIRA: We're not even sure
he'll make it back here.

652
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:16,015
<i>I'm sorry, Major, but we have our orders.</i>

653
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:17,266
Who gave you those orders?

654
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:18,893
<i>They come directly from General Hazar.</i>

655
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,228
Dax, get me General Hazar on Bajor.

656
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:24,523
Tell his people it's an emergency.
I want to speak to him now.

657
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:25,608
Stand by, interceptor.

658
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:28,194
General Hazar will be countermanding
those orders any minute.

659
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,155
The interceptor is closing
on the Skrreean ship.

660
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:36,202
It's General Hazar, Benjamin.

661
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,411
SISKO: On screen.

662
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,747
<i>What is this about, Commander?</i>

663
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,374
It's about the Skrreean vessel
that's approaching Bajor.

664
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,460
<i>I've already given the orders</i>
<i>to have it turned back.</i>

665
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:48,297
That ship is being flown by a child
and it's leaking radiation.

666
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:49,882
<i>A child?</i>

667
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:51,592
PILOT: <i>Skrreean ship. Repeating.</i>

668
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:55,304
<i>-Return to the space station now.</i>
<i>-Have him shut down his engines.</i>

669
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:56,931
<i>We'll tow him back.</i>

670
00:41:57,014 --> 00:42:00,684
Tumak, please, turn your engines off.

671
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:02,394
( shots firing )

672
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:03,979
Interceptor One, what's going on?

673
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,273
<i>They've opened fire on us.</i>
<i>Taking evasive action.</i>

674
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,025
Tumak, don't do this!

675
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:09,610
<i>PILOT: We've been hit!</i>

676
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,195
Commander, they're returning fire.

677
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,154
No!

678
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,032
Disengage, interceptor! Repeat, disengage.

679
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:18,202
General, tell your pilots
to hold their fire.

680
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:20,955
Relaying that order now.

681
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,294
( sobs )

682
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,923
Interceptor One.

683
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:34,969
<i>The Skrreean ship exploded.</i>
<i>I didn't even think we hit it.</i>

684
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,973
The phaser beam must've ignited
the radiation leak.

685
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,769
<i>I'm very sorry, Commander.</i>

686
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:46,355
We all are, General.

687
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:22,683
I just stopped by to wish
you luck on Draylon II.

688
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:27,313
Haneek, I still believe
this is the best choice...

689
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:29,690
For Bajor and for you.

690
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:33,068
You still believe we would have been
a burden to your people?

691
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:36,030
Yes.

692
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,283
I think you've made a terrible mistake.

693
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:40,659
All of you.

694
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:42,953
Maybe we could have helped you.

695
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,456
Maybe we could have helped each other.

696
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:50,169
The Skrreeans are farmers, Kira.
You have a famine on your planet.

697
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:53,964
Perhaps we could have made
that peninsula bloom again.

698
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,550
HANEEK: We'll never know, will we?

699
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:59,511
Fifty years of Cardassian rule

700
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:02,931
have made you all frightened
and suspicious.

701
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:06,185
I feel sorry for you.

702
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:12,941
You were right.

703
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,944
Bajor is not Kentanna.
