1
00:00:05,536 --> 00:00:07,506
You wanted to see me,
Commander?

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,035
Actually, what I'd like to see
is next month's duty roster.

3
00:00:13,218 --> 00:00:15,450
You'll have it on your desk
first thing in the morning.

4
00:00:15,489 --> 00:00:16,980
That's what you said yesterday.

5
00:00:17,026 --> 00:00:18,153
I know.

6
00:00:18,194 --> 00:00:20,893
I just spent the whole
day yesterday...

7
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:22,732
Talking to Minister Rozahn

8
00:00:22,771 --> 00:00:25,037
about irrigating
the Trilar Peninsula.

9
00:00:26,144 --> 00:00:27,112
How did you know?

10
00:00:27,146 --> 00:00:29,207
It's hard to keep
a secret in Ops...

11
00:00:29,283 --> 00:00:30,751
especially when you've
been shouting

12
00:00:30,787 --> 00:00:32,255
at a monitor
for the last two days.

13
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:36,127
Thought I kept it down
to an angry whisper.

14
00:00:36,164 --> 00:00:38,863
Let's just say
that your voice carries.

15
00:00:38,903 --> 00:00:42,000
Every time I talk
to one of the ministers

16
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,709
I promise myself, I'm not
going to lose control.

17
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,815
But then they give me
some stupid bureaucratic excuse

18
00:00:49,858 --> 00:00:51,589
for why something
isn't getting done

19
00:00:51,628 --> 00:00:53,154
and I get so...

20
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:55,168
- so...
- Frustrated.

21
00:00:55,202 --> 00:00:58,265
Oh, Commander,
I am way beyond frustrated.

22
00:00:58,341 --> 00:00:59,832
Bajor is in trouble.

23
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:01,244
I just want to help.

24
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,979
I can understand that,
and I sympathize.

25
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,317
As far as I'm concerned

26
00:01:05,355 --> 00:01:08,589
you can shout at the provisional
government all you want to

27
00:01:08,629 --> 00:01:10,155
as long as it doesn't interfere

28
00:01:10,198 --> 00:01:12,065
with your duties
here on the station.

29
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:15,067
You're right.

30
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:17,944
I'll get on that report
right away.

31
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:23,759
Oh, Major.

32
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:25,387
Quark's been looking for you.

33
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:26,624
He says it's urgent.

34
00:01:27,634 --> 00:01:28,795
Perfect.

35
00:02:02,704 --> 00:02:03,967
Huh?

36
00:02:36,037 --> 00:02:38,838
I hear you've been trying
to get in touch with me.

37
00:02:38,876 --> 00:02:40,037
You hear right.

38
00:02:40,078 --> 00:02:41,341
Look around you.

39
00:02:41,414 --> 00:02:43,850
Does anything seem
to be amiss?

40
00:02:43,886 --> 00:02:47,154
That sonata Varani
is playing is lovely.

41
00:02:47,192 --> 00:02:49,185
Your customers
seem to be enjoying him.

42
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:50,356
Why be modest, Major?

43
00:02:50,432 --> 00:02:51,992
They're not just
enjoying him

44
00:02:52,035 --> 00:02:53,526
they're mesmerized by him.

45
00:02:53,571 --> 00:02:54,596
So?

46
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,166
So, while they're
being mesmerized

47
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,180
they're not gambling,
they're not eating

48
00:02:58,214 --> 00:02:59,375
they're barely drinking.

49
00:02:59,483 --> 00:03:02,011
Profits are down
across the board.

50
00:03:02,055 --> 00:03:03,820
He just started yesterday.

51
00:03:03,859 --> 00:03:06,329
I monitor my gross
income hourly.

52
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,627
My hourly figures
become my indicators.

53
00:03:08,668 --> 00:03:10,865
My indicators
become my projections.

54
00:03:10,906 --> 00:03:14,937
And my projections...
based on the last 26 hours...

55
00:03:14,981 --> 00:03:17,349
show an unprecedented
decline in profits.

56
00:03:17,386 --> 00:03:19,686
Will you stop overreacting!

57
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,993
When people hear
how wonderful Varani is

58
00:03:23,031 --> 00:03:25,365
they'll come
beating down your door.

59
00:03:25,435 --> 00:03:27,132
What are you basing
that projection on?

60
00:03:27,172 --> 00:03:28,367
Bajoran intuition?

61
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,173
That and a strip of latinum
will get you

62
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:31,942
a couple of spins
at the dabo wheel.

63
00:03:31,982 --> 00:03:34,681
You promised me you would
try him out for a month.

64
00:03:34,721 --> 00:03:36,623
If my projections hold true

65
00:03:36,657 --> 00:03:39,185
in a month, I'll be
out of business.

66
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:41,860
Quark, you are going to do this.

67
00:03:41,902 --> 00:03:43,393
What for?

68
00:03:43,504 --> 00:03:45,440
Because I asked you to.

69
00:03:49,616 --> 00:03:52,952
Maybe he could play
something with a little more...

70
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,424
bounce to it.

71
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:56,655
Bounce?

72
00:03:56,697 --> 00:03:58,291
For a change of pace.

73
00:04:08,922 --> 00:04:10,551
That was beautiful.

74
00:04:10,592 --> 00:04:13,564
Having my work
appreciated again...

75
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:16,399
I've almost forgotten
how it feels.

76
00:04:16,437 --> 00:04:18,134
Granted, it's not quite

77
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,737
the exhibition halls
you're used to.

78
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,043
Ah, one can't be choosy

79
00:04:22,082 --> 00:04:24,018
about performance
venues these days.

80
00:04:24,052 --> 00:04:25,384
I just spoke with Quark.

81
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:26,889
He likes what you're doing

82
00:04:26,925 --> 00:04:29,624
but he's hoping you'll play
a variety of styles.

83
00:04:29,663 --> 00:04:31,690
A little less exhibition hall

84
00:04:31,734 --> 00:04:34,331
a little more music hall,
is that it?

85
00:04:34,373 --> 00:04:36,866
Something like that.

86
00:04:36,912 --> 00:04:39,543
I think I can accommodate him.

87
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,951
Dabo!

88
00:04:41,988 --> 00:04:47,295
I'd love to hear you play
in a more appropriate setting.

89
00:04:47,332 --> 00:04:49,700
Have you spoken
to Minister Bolka

90
00:04:49,736 --> 00:04:52,765
about my idea to rebuild
the Jalanda Forum?

91
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,905
I mentioned it to him.

92
00:04:54,948 --> 00:04:57,579
He's got a lot on his mind.

93
00:04:57,619 --> 00:04:59,179
You must keep trying.

94
00:04:59,223 --> 00:05:02,559
Bajorans must reclaim
their artistic heritage

95
00:05:02,596 --> 00:05:06,627
if they ever hope to regain
their sense of self-worth.

96
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:10,440
Next time I talk to the
Minister, I'll bring it up again

97
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:12,606
but I can't promise anything.

98
00:05:19,663 --> 00:05:20,824
Ah, Major.

99
00:05:20,866 --> 00:05:22,597
Get everything settled
with Quark?

100
00:05:22,636 --> 00:05:26,006
Oh, that little toad is this far
from doing a 360 out an airlock.

101
00:05:26,043 --> 00:05:27,637
I'm glad to hear
everything went okay.

102
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:30,480
Commander, sensors are picking
up elevated neutrino readings.

103
00:05:30,518 --> 00:05:32,147
A ship's coming
through the wormhole.

104
00:05:32,188 --> 00:05:33,588
On screen.

105
00:05:37,299 --> 00:05:39,633
Sensors are detecting
four life-forms on board.

106
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,833
I'm reading a plasma leak
in their engine core.

107
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,002
Hail them.

108
00:05:43,044 --> 00:05:44,673
No response.

109
00:05:44,713 --> 00:05:46,181
The reactor's overheating.

110
00:05:46,216 --> 00:05:48,049
Life support is
barely functioning.

111
00:05:48,087 --> 00:05:49,647
Get them out of there, Chief.

112
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,090
Aye, sir.

113
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:04,580
I'm Commander Sisko

114
00:06:04,619 --> 00:06:06,589
of the United
Federation of Planets.

115
00:06:06,623 --> 00:06:08,286
You've just been
beamed aboard

116
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:09,956
a Bajoran space station.

117
00:06:09,998 --> 00:06:11,661
We don't mean you any harm.

118
00:08:10,962 --> 00:08:12,328
We're going to bring
your ship in.

119
00:08:12,365 --> 00:08:13,925
Once it's docked

120
00:08:14,002 --> 00:08:16,940
we'll diagnose its problems
and hopefully fix them.

121
00:08:16,974 --> 00:08:19,035
After that,
you can be on your way.

122
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:22,176
I can offer medical
assistance for that wound.

123
00:08:22,218 --> 00:08:24,746
<i>Oo-mata! Oo-mata!</i>

124
00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:28,193

00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:41,220
<i>Skrreea.</i>

132
00:08:41,256 --> 00:08:42,953
Does anyone understand
what she's saying?

133
00:08:42,992 --> 00:08:45,292
Something must be wrong with
the universal translator.

134
00:08:45,331 --> 00:08:46,424
Chief?

135
00:08:46,466 --> 00:08:47,934
It's working, Commander

136
00:08:47,969 --> 00:08:50,371
but for some reason,
it's having a hard time

137
00:08:50,408 --> 00:08:52,241
analyzing
their language patterns.

138
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:54,680
Their syntax
and their grammatical structure

139
00:08:54,716 --> 00:08:57,517
must be completely unlike
anything in our database.

140
00:08:57,555 --> 00:08:58,853
We'll have to keep them talking

141
00:08:58,891 --> 00:09:02,057
until the computer can establish
a translation matrix.

142
00:09:02,098 --> 00:09:03,088
<i>Ketoh maseeca.</i>

00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:04,659

<i>Fenta?</i>

148
00:09:10,615 --> 00:09:12,915
Keeping them talking
shouldn't be much of a problem.

00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:13,977
<i>Oobay a-tal?</i>

150

<i>Fisdak setoma meeka?</i>

151
00:09:17,295 --> 00:09:21,429
Major, we've got to get them
down to the Infirmary.

152
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:24,840
They seem to be
most comfortable with you.

153
00:09:24,876 --> 00:09:27,108
Why don't you lead the way?

154
00:09:27,148 --> 00:09:28,309
A-All right.

155
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:32,188
Um... we're going to take
a little ride on the turbolift.

156
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:38,193
Toma.

157
00:09:38,237 --> 00:09:40,139
Bessa.

158
00:09:42,178 --> 00:09:43,476
Sisko to Odo.

159
00:09:43,514 --> 00:09:44,812
Yes, Commander.

160
00:09:44,849 --> 00:09:46,443
We're bringing some new arrivals

161
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:48,820
from the Gamma Quadrant
down to the Promenade.

162
00:09:48,857 --> 00:09:50,155
Meet us at Turbolift 9.

163
00:09:50,194 --> 00:09:52,494
I'm on my way.

164
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:59,405
We're here.

165
00:09:59,446 --> 00:10:01,848
You can come out now.

166
00:10:01,883 --> 00:10:04,548
There's no need to be afraid.

167
00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:05,557
Come on.

168
00:10:05,591 --> 00:10:06,991
It's all right.

169
00:10:07,027 --> 00:10:09,020
What seems to be the trouble,
Commander?

170
00:10:09,064 --> 00:10:10,727
The computer's
having a hard time

171
00:10:10,768 --> 00:10:12,100
translating their language.

172
00:10:12,138 --> 00:10:14,040
I can see how that
would be a problem.

173
00:10:14,074 --> 00:10:15,406
It's okay.

174
00:10:15,444 --> 00:10:16,776
Come on.

175
00:10:36,453 --> 00:10:37,421
Hold on!

176
00:10:37,455 --> 00:10:39,755
Let's stick together.

177
00:10:39,793 --> 00:10:41,125
No wandering off.

178
00:10:41,163 --> 00:10:45,263
Now you just stay put
while I round up your friend.

179
00:10:45,304 --> 00:10:47,001
Uh, let me try.

180
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,135
Come with me.

181
00:10:57,461 --> 00:10:59,192
Hello.

182
00:10:59,265 --> 00:11:03,399
<i>Intaowa.</i>
<i>Intaowa.</i>

183
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,840
Dress.

184
00:11:04,876 --> 00:11:06,903
It's called a dress.

185
00:11:06,947 --> 00:11:08,245
<i>Intaowa.</i>

186
00:11:08,283 --> 00:11:09,581
<i>Intaowa?</i>

187
00:11:09,619 --> 00:11:12,750
Uh, I'm afraid
you'll have to put that back.

188
00:11:12,792 --> 00:11:13,760
<i>Vala.</i>

189
00:11:13,794 --> 00:11:14,762
<i>Vala!</i>

190
00:11:14,796 --> 00:11:16,162
<i>Intaowa!</i>

191
00:11:16,233 --> 00:11:17,360
Do you like it?

192
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:19,803
Yes, it's very nice,
but it's not yours.

193
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,399
And that, that goes
for you, too.

194
00:11:21,443 --> 00:11:24,643
Major, perhaps you'd
better handle this.

195
00:11:24,682 --> 00:11:25,775
All right.

196
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:28,381
Let's put those back...
both of you.

197
00:11:28,423 --> 00:11:31,020
They really need
to put those back.

198
00:11:31,061 --> 00:11:32,860
We can go shopping later

199
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:35,392
but right now,
it's very important

200
00:11:35,437 --> 00:11:37,566
that we go to the Infirmary.

201
00:11:37,608 --> 00:11:39,441
So, everyone, follow me.

202
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:41,142
We'll all go together.

203
00:11:41,181 --> 00:11:42,810

00:11:42,852 --> 00:11:45,186

<i>Kolat kee!</i>

209
00:12:00,321 --> 00:12:02,553
Hmm, there's no doubt
who the boss is.

210
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:03,957
How bad is it, Doctor?

211
00:12:03,994 --> 00:12:06,625
Looks like a second-degree
plasma burn.

212
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:09,297
The dermal regenerator
should take care of it.

213
00:12:11,776 --> 00:12:13,210
I'm sorry.

214
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,147
I'm not the doctor.

215
00:12:15,183 --> 00:12:16,515
<i>Kolat gadoux?</i>

216
00:12:16,553 --> 00:12:18,352
I assure you...

217
00:12:19,692 --> 00:12:21,821
I will not hurt him.

218
00:12:21,863 --> 00:12:23,856
He's going to be all right.

219
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,939
These will be your quarters

220
00:12:29,979 --> 00:12:31,505
while you're here
at the station.

221
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:32,778
I'm sure you want to rest

222
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:34,913
and clean up and...
you don't understand

223
00:12:34,956 --> 00:12:37,051
anything I'm saying, do you?

224
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:41,902
I know something
they might understand.

225
00:12:43,407 --> 00:12:46,277
Seven maaza stalks.

226
00:12:54,094 --> 00:12:56,155
This is food.

227
00:12:56,198 --> 00:12:58,761
Please, try one.

228
00:12:59,772 --> 00:13:03,371
Major, show them it's okay.

229
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:07,550
See.

230
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,384
Mmm.

231
00:13:09,517 --> 00:13:12,284
Mmm, it's really very good.

232
00:13:41,481 --> 00:13:42,449
Mmm...

233
00:13:42,483 --> 00:13:44,316
I'm glad you like them.

00:13:44,354 --> 00:13:47,724

Wait.

246
00:14:05,629 --> 00:14:06,824
Did you hear that?

247
00:14:06,865 --> 00:14:08,528
I think she said "need."

248
00:14:08,569 --> 00:14:09,935
Go on, keep talking.

Save them? How?

255
00:14:23,865 --> 00:14:25,630
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

256
00:14:25,669 --> 00:14:26,830
Keep talking.

There's no time <i>soulak.</i>

260
00:14:32,783 --> 00:14:34,480
We are the <i>Skrreea.</i>

261
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,422
My people need your help.

262
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,360
There's no time to waste.

263
00:14:38,395 --> 00:14:39,658
Your people are the Skrreea.

264
00:14:39,697 --> 00:14:40,756
You need our help.

265
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,199
There's no time to waste.

266
00:14:43,505 --> 00:14:45,168
Your people... where are they?

267
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:48,112
They are on the <i>creshnee</i>
side of the Eye.

268
00:14:48,147 --> 00:14:49,206
The "Eye?"

269
00:14:49,249 --> 00:14:51,151
The Eye of the Universe.

270
00:14:51,186 --> 00:14:52,677
The tunnel.

271
00:14:52,723 --> 00:14:55,388
I think she means the wormhole.

272
00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:57,365
They are on the other side.

273
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,893
They don't realize
we found the Eye.

274
00:14:59,937 --> 00:15:02,568
How many people
are we talking about?

275
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,639
Many... three <i>jeetaka.</i>

276
00:15:05,683 --> 00:15:07,243
Three hundred?

277
00:15:07,285 --> 00:15:09,346
Three thousand?

278
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:11,757
Three million?

279
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,126
Three million.

280
00:15:13,164 --> 00:15:16,695
Three million of my people
are on the other side.

281
00:15:16,738 --> 00:15:19,403
We must bring them
through the Eye.

282
00:15:19,444 --> 00:15:21,346
We must bring them here.

283
00:15:35,108 --> 00:15:37,442
L-ls there anything wrong?

284
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,611
I'm just not used
to the men being here.

285
00:15:40,652 --> 00:15:42,815
Skrreean men don't
involve themselves

286
00:15:42,857 --> 00:15:44,656
in situations like this.

287
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,493
Are all your leaders women?

288
00:15:46,531 --> 00:15:47,499
Yes.

289
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:49,001
All of them?

290
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:50,003
You heard her, Julian.

291
00:15:50,037 --> 00:15:52,337
Men are far too emotional
to be leaders.

292
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:55,279
They're constantly
fighting among themselves.

293
00:15:55,314 --> 00:15:57,409
It's their favorite thing to do.

294
00:15:58,789 --> 00:15:59,814
I'm sorry.

295
00:15:59,857 --> 00:16:01,793
I hope I haven't
offended anyone.

296
00:16:05,168 --> 00:16:06,636
Sorry to keep you waiting.

297
00:16:06,671 --> 00:16:07,900
It's all right, Benjamin.

298
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,340
Haneek was just telling us

299
00:16:09,376 --> 00:16:11,778
how the Skrreea are
a female-dominant society.

300
00:16:11,815 --> 00:16:14,651
It seems the men are a bit
too emotional to be leaders.

301
00:16:14,687 --> 00:16:17,089
Please do not misunderstand.

302
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,525
We love our men.

303
00:16:20,031 --> 00:16:22,501
Really!

304
00:16:22,536 --> 00:16:25,599
Are you one of the leaders
of your people, Haneek?

305
00:16:25,642 --> 00:16:27,110
Me?

306
00:16:27,145 --> 00:16:28,842
Oh, no.

307
00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:31,785
I'm little more than a farmer.

308
00:16:31,821 --> 00:16:33,415
I was just lucky.

309
00:16:33,457 --> 00:16:35,086
How so?

310
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,997
I was the first one to find
the Eye of the Universe.

311
00:16:38,033 --> 00:16:40,469
You were looking
for the wormhole?

312
00:16:40,505 --> 00:16:43,238
We had heard about a great
tunnel being discovered.

313
00:16:43,277 --> 00:16:45,509
We knew it must be
the Eye of the Universe

314
00:16:45,549 --> 00:16:47,212
that would lead us to Kentanna.

315
00:16:47,252 --> 00:16:49,051
Kentanna?

316
00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:52,255
Kentanna is the legendary
home of the Skrreeans.

317
00:16:52,295 --> 00:16:55,529
It has always been portrayed
in our sacred texts

318
00:16:55,569 --> 00:16:58,541
as being just beyond
the Eye of the Universe.

319
00:16:58,575 --> 00:17:01,011
A planet of sorrow,
where the Skrreean will sow

320
00:17:01,046 --> 00:17:03,312
seeds of joy.

321
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,684
I can't guarantee
you'll find Kentanna.

322
00:17:05,722 --> 00:17:09,024
But I can promise you
that we'll help you find a home.

323
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:10,725
We sent our runabouts

324
00:17:10,766 --> 00:17:13,294
to the Gamma Quadrant
to make contact with your ships.

325
00:17:13,337 --> 00:17:15,102
That will be difficult.

326
00:17:15,141 --> 00:17:18,409
They're all spread out
looking for the Eye.

327
00:17:18,447 --> 00:17:20,883
And when we find them...
what then?

328
00:17:20,986 --> 00:17:23,753
This station
only holds 7,000 people.

329
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:27,196
You're talking about
three million Skrreeans.

330
00:17:27,231 --> 00:17:29,064
I'm afraid most of your people

331
00:17:29,102 --> 00:17:31,504
will have to be confined
to their ships.

332
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,508
I understand.

333
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:33,840
In the meantime

334
00:17:33,878 --> 00:17:36,679
is there any one person
we should be looking for?

335
00:17:36,718 --> 00:17:39,086
A leader or leaders?

336
00:17:39,122 --> 00:17:42,151
Most of our leaders were
killed by the T-Rogorans.

337
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:44,392
The T-Rogorans.
Who are they?

338
00:17:44,432 --> 00:17:47,632
For eight centuries, my people
have lived under their rule.

339
00:17:47,673 --> 00:17:50,577
We have been forced to work
as laborers and servants.

340
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:51,807
We were able to escape

341
00:17:51,848 --> 00:17:54,411
when the T-Rogorans were invaded
and conquered.

342
00:17:54,452 --> 00:17:55,943
Who conquered them?

343
00:17:56,023 --> 00:17:57,856
I do not know their name.

344
00:17:57,893 --> 00:18:00,125
I only know they were members

345
00:18:00,164 --> 00:18:02,829
of something called
"The Dominion."

346
00:18:19,302 --> 00:18:20,327
Did I wake you?

347
00:18:20,371 --> 00:18:21,839
Oh, that's all right.

348
00:18:21,874 --> 00:18:22,933
Please, come in.

349
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,775
Computer, lights on full.

350
00:18:24,814 --> 00:18:26,443
I can come back.

351
00:18:26,483 --> 00:18:27,746
No.

352
00:18:27,786 --> 00:18:29,688
You've been so kind to me.

353
00:18:29,723 --> 00:18:32,820
How could I possibly
refuse your company?

354
00:18:36,838 --> 00:18:38,136
Go back to bed.

355
00:18:38,173 --> 00:18:39,300
Go on!

356
00:18:39,342 --> 00:18:40,469
Go on.

357
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,674
I'll join you again
after I'm through.

358
00:18:46,523 --> 00:18:49,086
Are those your husbands?

359
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,894
Hus-bands?

360
00:18:50,932 --> 00:18:53,563
I'm not familiar with that word.

361
00:18:53,604 --> 00:18:55,335
They're bonded to me.

362
00:18:55,374 --> 00:18:59,337
Do you sleep with them both?

363
00:18:59,382 --> 00:19:00,350
Of course.

364
00:19:00,384 --> 00:19:02,513
Don't you sleep with your males?

365
00:19:02,555 --> 00:19:04,889
No, I don't have any males.

366
00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:09,297
Not at the moment, anyway.

367
00:19:09,335 --> 00:19:11,703
They're very useful.

368
00:19:11,741 --> 00:19:14,143
Yes, I can imagine they are.

369
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:18,883
I just wanted to tell you,
we found some of your ships.

370
00:19:18,922 --> 00:19:20,983
Several hundred
Skrreeans should be

371
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:22,791
arriving at the station today.

372
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,195
We thought it would be
a good idea

373
00:19:24,232 --> 00:19:25,598
if you were there to greet them.

374
00:19:25,634 --> 00:19:27,695
Why me?

375
00:19:27,739 --> 00:19:30,734
You yourself said most
of your leaders were dead.

376
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:36,348
Yes, that's true,
but, Kira, I'm just a farmer.

377
00:19:36,389 --> 00:19:39,589
You also were the first one
through the Eye of the Universe.

378
00:19:39,629 --> 00:19:42,897
That's got to mean something...
in some symbolic sort of way.

379
00:19:46,376 --> 00:19:48,039
Oh, here.

380
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:50,173
I brought you something.

381
00:19:50,217 --> 00:19:51,914
Go ahead, open it.

382
00:19:56,931 --> 00:19:58,594
You seemed to like it.

383
00:20:04,112 --> 00:20:06,412
I'm sorry.

384
00:20:06,449 --> 00:20:09,319
I think you misunderstood.

385
00:20:09,355 --> 00:20:10,915
What do you mean?

386
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:15,024
I thought this was
the most hideous thing

387
00:20:15,067 --> 00:20:16,194
I'd ever seen.

388
00:20:17,806 --> 00:20:20,505
Well, that makes two of us.

389
00:20:22,148 --> 00:20:24,015
It's awful.

390
00:20:24,052 --> 00:20:26,236
It's horrible.

391
00:20:26,369 --> 00:20:29,569
Who would wear that?

392
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,661
It was no big deal.

393
00:20:44,706 --> 00:20:48,237
You go on a date with a dabo
girl for the first time

394
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,477
and you sit there and tell me
it was no big deal?

395
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:52,146
It wasn't really a date.

396
00:20:52,188 --> 00:20:54,488
Does your father know
you went out with her?

397
00:20:54,525 --> 00:20:55,823
Not exactly.

398
00:20:55,862 --> 00:20:57,091
He doesn't?

399
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:59,601
I told him I had to help
someone with her homework.

400
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:00,830
Good thinking.

401
00:21:00,905 --> 00:21:03,375
Too bad I'll never
be able to use that lie.

402
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,437
My dad knows
I never do homework.

403
00:21:05,481 --> 00:21:06,449
It's not a lie, Nog.

404
00:21:06,483 --> 00:21:07,781
Mardah's studying entomology.

405
00:21:07,819 --> 00:21:09,151
She asked me to help her out.

406
00:21:09,188 --> 00:21:11,989
A dabo girl
who studies entomology?

407
00:21:12,027 --> 00:21:13,461
Ha! Sure.

408
00:21:13,497 --> 00:21:14,795
It's true.

409
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,165
Yeah.

410
00:21:19,008 --> 00:21:20,739
What is entomology?

411
00:21:20,778 --> 00:21:22,041
The study of bugs.

412
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:25,919
Oh, you mean
she wants to be a chef?

413
00:21:27,691 --> 00:21:28,716
Hey, who's that?

414
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,525
I don't know.

415
00:21:32,701 --> 00:21:34,568
What's he doing?

416
00:21:34,605 --> 00:21:36,837
Oh, that's disgusting!

417
00:21:36,911 --> 00:21:38,813
He must be
one of those Skrreeans.

418
00:21:38,848 --> 00:21:41,284
My dad says there's
a lot more on the way.

419
00:21:44,091 --> 00:21:45,389
Hi!

420
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,830
Doesn't he know
what a replicator's for?

421
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,202
Idiot!

422
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:56,011
So, does Mardah
have any sisters?

423
00:22:01,092 --> 00:22:04,155
Commander, I've cleared
the Skrreean ship

424
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:05,724
to dock at Upper Pylon 2.

425
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:09,730
It's time to welcome your people
to the Alpha Quadrant, Haneek.

426
00:22:22,067 --> 00:22:25,096
Come along, don't be afraid.

427
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,372
Come on, it's all right.

428
00:22:27,411 --> 00:22:29,108
You're among friends.

429
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:30,639
Don't be afraid.

430
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:33,713
It's all right.
It's all right.

431
00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:18,107
Slow down!

432
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:20,116
There's no running
on the Promenade.

433
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,915
It's going to get
awfully crowded

434
00:23:21,987 --> 00:23:23,285
around here, Commander.

435
00:23:23,323 --> 00:23:25,920
I know, Constable,
but it's worth it.

436
00:23:25,995 --> 00:23:27,293
Just look at them.

437
00:23:27,331 --> 00:23:30,964
They're experiencing
their first taste of freedom.

438
00:23:39,655 --> 00:23:40,782
Nog, where you going?

439
00:23:40,824 --> 00:23:42,350
Can't talk now.
Gotta run!

440
00:23:42,394 --> 00:23:43,419
Nog!

441
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:46,526
You know there's no running
on the Promenade.

442
00:23:46,569 --> 00:23:47,935
Who's running?

443
00:23:47,972 --> 00:23:50,637
What seems to be
the problem here?

444
00:23:50,677 --> 00:23:52,271
What's that smell?

445
00:23:52,314 --> 00:23:53,441
Ask him.

446
00:23:53,483 --> 00:23:54,451
Me?

447
00:23:54,485 --> 00:23:55,612
You're the one who stinks.

448
00:23:55,654 --> 00:23:57,749
That's because you sprayed
that vapor on us.

449
00:23:57,791 --> 00:23:59,488
Is that true, Nog?

450
00:23:59,528 --> 00:24:01,293
No!

451
00:24:01,332 --> 00:24:03,199
Nog...

452
00:24:04,438 --> 00:24:06,533
It was a joke.

453
00:24:06,576 --> 00:24:08,170
Very amusing.

454
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:10,547
Thank you for bringing
this to my attention.

455
00:24:10,584 --> 00:24:12,417
I'll take care of it from here.

456
00:24:16,295 --> 00:24:19,267
This isn't over yet, big ears.

457
00:24:30,056 --> 00:24:33,153
Hey, here's a new one.

458
00:24:33,196 --> 00:24:37,000
What kind of name is
"Plix Tixiplik?"

459
00:24:37,037 --> 00:24:39,166
I believe he's a Reegrunion.

460
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,815
"Wanted in seven star systems
for illegal weapon sales."

461
00:24:46,856 --> 00:24:48,587
Weapon sales, huh?

462
00:24:48,626 --> 00:24:50,152
Very profitable.

463
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,394
How would you know about that?

464
00:24:52,434 --> 00:24:54,461
My Uncle Quark told me.

465
00:24:54,505 --> 00:25:00,005
And what would your Uncle Quark
know about illegal weapon sales?

466
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:02,486
He, uh... he, uh...

467
00:25:02,521 --> 00:25:03,921
Knows better than to ever

468
00:25:03,957 --> 00:25:06,895
get involved in anything
so disreputable.

469
00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:08,420
I'm sure.

470
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:11,768
I asked that the boy's father
come to see me.

471
00:25:11,806 --> 00:25:14,003
Rom is doing
the weekly stock inventory.

472
00:25:14,044 --> 00:25:15,638
I don't want to interrupt him.

473
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,513
You know how easy
he loses count.

474
00:25:17,551 --> 00:25:20,114
So, I came in his place.

475
00:25:20,156 --> 00:25:22,456
Nog, have you been
causing mischief again?

476
00:25:22,494 --> 00:25:23,621
No, Uncle.

477
00:25:23,663 --> 00:25:25,029
It's all a misunderstanding.

478
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:26,364
He sprayed

479
00:25:26,402 --> 00:25:29,431
several Skrreean boys
with a foul-smelling vapor.

480
00:25:29,475 --> 00:25:30,465
Did he?

481
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,242
What do you have
to say for yourself?

482
00:25:34,285 --> 00:25:36,482
I-I'm sorry?

483
00:25:36,522 --> 00:25:38,719
You see the boy's
beside himself with guilt.

484
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,323
That doesn't excuse his actions.

485
00:25:41,365 --> 00:25:43,528
And he will be
punished severely.

486
00:25:43,569 --> 00:25:45,003
I will?

487
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,909
I want you to tell
the Constable here

488
00:25:47,945 --> 00:25:50,438
that you will never do it again.

489
00:25:50,483 --> 00:25:51,883
I won't?

490
00:25:53,122 --> 00:25:54,556
I mean, I won't.

491
00:25:54,591 --> 00:25:55,559
I promise.

492
00:25:55,593 --> 00:25:56,686
Never again.

493
00:25:56,729 --> 00:25:58,562
See that you don't.

494
00:25:59,635 --> 00:26:01,434
Can I leave now?

495
00:26:03,876 --> 00:26:05,607
Go on.

496
00:26:09,254 --> 00:26:12,249
You know, you really
can't blame the boy.

497
00:26:12,294 --> 00:26:14,196
And why is that?

498
00:26:14,231 --> 00:26:15,722
Oh, come on, Odo.

499
00:26:15,767 --> 00:26:17,600
You know these Skrreeans
are nothing but trouble.

500
00:26:17,637 --> 00:26:19,197
They're all over the station

501
00:26:19,241 --> 00:26:23,443
looking and touching,
never buying anything.

502
00:26:23,483 --> 00:26:25,043
And they flake.

503
00:26:25,086 --> 00:26:26,349
I didn't notice.

504
00:26:26,389 --> 00:26:27,482
Come to my place.

505
00:26:27,524 --> 00:26:30,257
You'll see little pieces
of Skrreean skin

506
00:26:30,296 --> 00:26:32,391
all over the bar and the floor.

507
00:26:32,434 --> 00:26:33,493
It's disgusting.

508
00:26:33,536 --> 00:26:35,116
Well, they won't be here long.

509
00:26:35,249 --> 00:26:36,114
I hope not.

510
00:26:36,151 --> 00:26:37,780
They're driving
my paying customers away.

511
00:26:37,854 --> 00:26:40,051
They stay here too long,
and I'll be out of business.

512
00:26:40,091 --> 00:26:43,552
In that case,
I hope they never leave.

513
00:27:02,102 --> 00:27:06,338
We've talked it over
among ourselves.

514
00:27:06,378 --> 00:27:09,714
Our feelings were unanimous.

515
00:27:09,751 --> 00:27:13,782
You discovered
the Eye of the Universe.

516
00:27:13,892 --> 00:27:19,267
You must lead us
the rest of the way.

517
00:27:25,015 --> 00:27:27,485
I'll do the best I can.

518
00:27:39,344 --> 00:27:42,578
That looked serious.

519
00:27:42,617 --> 00:27:45,487
Is everything all right?

520
00:27:46,692 --> 00:27:49,255
Look at them.

521
00:27:49,297 --> 00:27:51,096
Look at my people.

522
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:56,332
I've never seen them so happy

523
00:27:56,378 --> 00:28:00,148
and here I sit, feeling trapped.

524
00:28:00,186 --> 00:28:01,654
Why?

525
00:28:01,688 --> 00:28:05,321
They expect me
to lead them to Kentanna.

526
00:28:07,533 --> 00:28:09,162
It's going to be okay.

527
00:28:09,204 --> 00:28:12,301
Commander Sisko is doing
everything he can

528
00:28:12,343 --> 00:28:14,472
to find you a place to live.

529
00:28:14,514 --> 00:28:16,780
You're not alone.

530
00:28:16,818 --> 00:28:18,378
I hope I'm not intruding.

531
00:28:18,422 --> 00:28:19,583
Oh, not at all.

532
00:28:19,624 --> 00:28:21,594
Haneek, this is Varani,
a great musician.

533
00:28:21,628 --> 00:28:24,862
Maybe the greatest
Bajor has ever known.

534
00:28:24,968 --> 00:28:30,138
She exaggerates, but that's
why I'm so fond of her.

535
00:28:31,882 --> 00:28:37,348
Being a Bajoran, I know what
it's like to be displaced.

536
00:28:37,393 --> 00:28:42,802
As a token of friendship,
I would like to give you this.

537
00:28:48,715 --> 00:28:51,414
It's from a concert
I played

538
00:28:51,455 --> 00:28:55,020
many years ago
at the Jalanda Forum.

539
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:11,556
Tumak, where have you been?

540
00:29:11,595 --> 00:29:12,563
Nowhere.

541
00:29:12,597 --> 00:29:13,565
Where are you going?

542
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:14,999
To wash.

543
00:29:25,589 --> 00:29:27,855
Computer...

544
00:29:27,894 --> 00:29:31,094
please show me a chart
of this star system.

545
00:29:40,051 --> 00:29:41,076
So, what'd your dad say?

546
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,213
About what?

547
00:29:42,255 --> 00:29:43,884
About you getting
in trouble with Odo.

548
00:29:43,926 --> 00:29:44,916
He was very angry.

549
00:29:44,961 --> 00:29:46,054
He was?

550
00:29:46,096 --> 00:29:48,464
He always gets angry
when I get caught.

551
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:51,968
I just remembered.

552
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:54,239
I have some errands
to run for my uncle.

553
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:56,442
You're going to have
to face them

554
00:29:56,484 --> 00:29:57,543
sooner or later.

555
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,716
That was very funny,
what you did.

556
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:01,157
You see, Jake?

557
00:30:01,193 --> 00:30:04,792
There's a man
with a sense of humor.

558
00:30:04,834 --> 00:30:06,895
Nobody's laughing.

559
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:08,805
And luckily nobody got hurt.

560
00:30:08,842 --> 00:30:12,008
I think my friend's real
sorry for what he did.

561
00:30:13,852 --> 00:30:15,651
Aren't you?

562
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:17,021
I suppose.

563
00:30:17,092 --> 00:30:18,185
See?

564
00:30:18,227 --> 00:30:19,753
What'd I tell you?

565
00:30:19,797 --> 00:30:22,165
He doesn't sound sorry to me.

566
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:39,302
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

567
00:30:39,336 --> 00:30:40,702
That's enough.

568
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:41,934
Break it up.

569
00:30:41,975 --> 00:30:44,036
I said, break it up!

570
00:30:49,757 --> 00:30:52,456
It's bad enough you're
all hanging around the station

571
00:30:52,496 --> 00:30:53,725
without buying anything.

572
00:30:53,765 --> 00:30:55,428
You have to start fighting, too?

573
00:30:55,469 --> 00:30:57,632
I thought we were welcome here.

574
00:30:57,673 --> 00:31:00,770
Well, make yourself welcome
somewhere else.

575
00:31:00,813 --> 00:31:02,578
You don't want us here.

576
00:31:02,616 --> 00:31:05,452
You don't want anything
to do with us.

577
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:09,361
Well, we don't want anything
to do with you.

578
00:31:09,397 --> 00:31:10,729
Any of you!

579
00:31:16,377 --> 00:31:17,845
I can see the Skrreeans

580
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,114
don't bother
to teach their children manners.

581
00:31:22,857 --> 00:31:23,847
Dax and I have been

582
00:31:23,892 --> 00:31:25,589
combing through data
on every uninhabited

583
00:31:25,629 --> 00:31:27,360
M-Class planet in the sector.

584
00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:28,867
We think that Draylon II

585
00:31:28,902 --> 00:31:31,430
would make a perfect home
for the Skrreea.

586
00:31:31,474 --> 00:31:32,442
Draylon II?

587
00:31:32,476 --> 00:31:34,275
I've never heard of it.

588
00:31:34,312 --> 00:31:35,941
It's near Sefalla Prime.

589
00:31:35,983 --> 00:31:38,112
It's got definite possibilities.

590
00:31:38,154 --> 00:31:40,386
Stable orbit, temperate climate

591
00:31:40,425 --> 00:31:42,691
and a very low
surface radiation.

592
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:45,566
Add to that good soil
and a long growing season.

593
00:31:45,602 --> 00:31:47,401
I think it's our best bet.

594
00:31:59,129 --> 00:32:00,097
May we come in?

595
00:32:00,131 --> 00:32:01,360
Of course.

596
00:32:10,586 --> 00:32:12,215
Ladies.

597
00:32:14,827 --> 00:32:16,694
Forgive them, Commander Sisko.

598
00:32:16,731 --> 00:32:18,701
They don't mean any disrespect.

599
00:32:18,735 --> 00:32:19,828
I understand.

600
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:21,841
We have some encouraging news.

601
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:23,572
We think we've found a planet

602
00:32:23,612 --> 00:32:26,277
for you and your people,
one with excellent potential

603
00:32:26,316 --> 00:32:27,842
for resettlement.

604
00:32:30,124 --> 00:32:33,153
We appreciate all your hard work

605
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:35,997
but I'm afraid
it was unnecessary.

606
00:32:36,036 --> 00:32:38,370
You see, we found Kentanna.

607
00:32:38,407 --> 00:32:40,707
You did?

608
00:32:40,746 --> 00:32:43,182
A planet of sorrow, Kira.

609
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,650
Don't you see?

610
00:32:44,687 --> 00:32:47,089
Kentanna is your planet.

611
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:49,688
Kentanna is Bajor.

612
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:02,411
Station Log, Stardate 47391.2.

613
00:33:02,455 --> 00:33:05,086
Chief O'Brien is continuing
to oversee repairs

614
00:33:05,127 --> 00:33:07,290
to the Skrreean ships docked
at the station.

615
00:33:07,332 --> 00:33:10,065
Meanwhile, Minister Rozahn
and Vedek Sorad have arrived

616
00:33:10,104 --> 00:33:12,131
from Bajor
with an official response

617
00:33:12,175 --> 00:33:14,407
to the Skrreeans' request
to immigrate.

618
00:33:14,446 --> 00:33:16,177
Major, if I may have a moment?

619
00:33:16,216 --> 00:33:17,184
I'm sorry, Varani.

620
00:33:17,218 --> 00:33:18,652
I'm on my way to a meeting.

621
00:33:18,688 --> 00:33:21,489
I know... with Minister
Rozahn and Vedek Sorad.

622
00:33:21,527 --> 00:33:23,588
I presume Haneek
will be there as well.

623
00:33:23,631 --> 00:33:25,191
That's right.

624
00:33:25,234 --> 00:33:29,004
Please tell here that my heart
goes out to her and her people.

625
00:33:29,042 --> 00:33:31,308
Tell her how much
Bajorans everywhere

626
00:33:31,346 --> 00:33:33,009
regret having to refuse
their request.

627
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,815
Aren't you being
a little premature?

628
00:33:34,854 --> 00:33:36,186
Am I? You know what

629
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:38,659
the provisional government's
answer is going to be.

630
00:33:38,695 --> 00:33:41,496
These are people who have
lost everything, Varani.

631
00:33:41,534 --> 00:33:44,904
I know, and I wish there was
some way we could help them.

632
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:49,074
But Bajor is in shambles, Kira.

633
00:33:49,115 --> 00:33:51,643
You know that as well as I do.

634
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,757
First of all,
I want you all to know

635
00:33:56,798 --> 00:34:00,863
that the provisional government
has taken the Skrreeans' request

636
00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:02,876
for immigration very seriously.

637
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:05,210
The debate
in the Chamber of Ministers

638
00:34:05,314 --> 00:34:07,147
became quite heated at times.

639
00:34:07,185 --> 00:34:09,348
Though I suppose
you could say that

640
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:10,983
about all of our debates.

641
00:34:11,026 --> 00:34:13,998
But a decision was reached.

642
00:34:14,032 --> 00:34:16,161
Yes, I was sent here to tell you

643
00:34:16,203 --> 00:34:19,938
that the Ministers... in accord
with the Vedek Assembly...

644
00:34:19,977 --> 00:34:23,849
have decided to deny
the Skrreeans' request.

645
00:34:23,885 --> 00:34:25,114
I am sorry.

646
00:34:25,154 --> 00:34:29,994
Bajor simply cannot absorb three
million refugees at this time.

647
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:32,797
After what the Cardassians
did to our planet

648
00:34:32,836 --> 00:34:34,285
we can barely
take care of our own.

649
00:34:34,418 --> 00:34:36,981
But no one is asking you
to take care of us.

650
00:34:37,024 --> 00:34:39,392
This decision is not based

651
00:34:39,428 --> 00:34:42,491
strictly on Bajoran
self-interest.

652
00:34:42,534 --> 00:34:45,267
Such a huge increase
in population

653
00:34:45,307 --> 00:34:48,177
would prove to be tragic
to your people as well as ours.

654
00:34:48,213 --> 00:34:50,581
But Bajor has more
than enough room for us.

655
00:34:50,618 --> 00:34:52,679
The plains
of the Northwest Peninsula

656
00:34:52,722 --> 00:34:54,282
are practically uninhabited.

657
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:55,988
The land's ideal for farming.

658
00:34:56,028 --> 00:34:57,326
It used to be

659
00:34:57,364 --> 00:35:00,302
before the Cardassians
got their hands on it.

660
00:35:00,337 --> 00:35:03,776
Minister Rozahn,
the Skrreea are farmers.

661
00:35:03,878 --> 00:35:05,780
Just give us the land.

662
00:35:05,848 --> 00:35:09,652
I guarantee you,
we can make it thrive again.

663
00:35:09,689 --> 00:35:12,559
Under ideal circumstances,
perhaps you could.

664
00:35:12,594 --> 00:35:15,327
But what if the circumstances
aren't ideal?

665
00:35:15,367 --> 00:35:18,134
What if we go through
another long winter?

666
00:35:18,173 --> 00:35:19,733
What if your crops fail?

667
00:35:19,776 --> 00:35:20,971
What if the famine

668
00:35:21,012 --> 00:35:24,246
that has been plaguing Bajor
continues to spread?

669
00:35:24,285 --> 00:35:25,583
What then?

670
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:28,285
We are willing
to take that risk.

671
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:29,920
I'm afraid we aren't.

672
00:35:29,963 --> 00:35:31,796
We ran a series of projections

673
00:35:31,834 --> 00:35:34,931
to see whether a Skrreean
settlement could survive

674
00:35:34,973 --> 00:35:36,636
on the Northwest peninsula.

675
00:35:36,677 --> 00:35:38,772
The results were
not encouraging.

676
00:35:38,814 --> 00:35:40,613
Haneek?

677
00:35:40,651 --> 00:35:42,587
I think you should
seriously consider

678
00:35:42,621 --> 00:35:44,523
Draylon II as an alternate
to Bajor.

679
00:35:44,558 --> 00:35:45,685
The winters are mild.

680
00:35:45,728 --> 00:35:47,493
There's plenty of good farmland.

681
00:35:47,531 --> 00:35:50,401
No!
Projections can be wrong.

682
00:35:50,437 --> 00:35:52,873
But what if they're not?

683
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:56,609
What is Bajor to do
if your people start dying?

684
00:35:56,649 --> 00:35:58,414
I thought I made that clear.

685
00:35:58,453 --> 00:36:00,446
We are not expecting your help.

686
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:03,758
Do you really think we could
stand by and do nothing?

687
00:36:03,797 --> 00:36:07,236
We would feel obligated to help
with food, with clothing

688
00:36:07,271 --> 00:36:08,968
with whatever it would take.

689
00:36:09,008 --> 00:36:11,171
And where would
that aid come from?

690
00:36:11,212 --> 00:36:13,945
Our resources
are already depleted.

691
00:36:13,984 --> 00:36:17,754
To help you would mean
depriving our own people.

692
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,124
I am afraid the decision

693
00:36:19,161 --> 00:36:22,031
of the provisional government
is final.

694
00:36:22,067 --> 00:36:25,666
The Skrreea will have
to find somewhere else to live.

695
00:36:27,779 --> 00:36:31,047
Please, talk to them.

696
00:36:31,085 --> 00:36:33,078
Tell them they're wrong.

697
00:36:34,993 --> 00:36:36,690
Help us.

698
00:36:39,736 --> 00:36:41,227
I can't.

699
00:36:43,042 --> 00:36:44,841
I'm sorry, Haneek...

700
00:36:44,879 --> 00:36:46,405
but they're right.

701
00:36:46,449 --> 00:36:48,214
I wish they weren't.

702
00:36:48,252 --> 00:36:51,783
I wish Bajor was Kentanna.

703
00:36:51,827 --> 00:36:53,854
But it's not.

704
00:36:56,435 --> 00:37:00,432
There's still Draylon II.

705
00:37:09,428 --> 00:37:11,125
Ooh!

706
00:37:11,165 --> 00:37:12,633
Look at this!

707
00:37:18,613 --> 00:37:19,672
Excuse me.

708
00:37:21,218 --> 00:37:22,186
If you like cake

709
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,814
the icoberry torte
is really good.

710
00:37:23,857 --> 00:37:26,852
Is that big-eared troll
really your friend?

711
00:37:26,897 --> 00:37:28,799
Yeah.
He's an idiot.

712
00:37:28,834 --> 00:37:30,929
You're not the first
to say that.

713
00:37:31,005 --> 00:37:33,943
But he's not such a bad guy
once you get to know him.

714
00:37:34,044 --> 00:37:36,105
I don't plan on being
around here that long.

715
00:37:36,148 --> 00:37:39,416
My dad says you're probably
going to Draylon II.

716
00:37:39,455 --> 00:37:40,548
Does he?

717
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,958
Yeah, sounds like a nice place.

718
00:37:42,995 --> 00:37:44,395
Do you want to move there?

719
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:45,626
No.

720
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:48,195
Neither do I.

721
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,986
Come in.

722
00:38:04,538 --> 00:38:06,269
Haneek...

723
00:38:08,012 --> 00:38:11,280
The thing I don't understand
is why you pretended

724
00:38:11,318 --> 00:38:12,377
to be my friend.

725
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,913
I wasn't pretending.

726
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,120
Ahh!

727
00:38:16,162 --> 00:38:18,963
So you are my friend...

728
00:38:19,067 --> 00:38:21,230
until I need you.

729
00:38:25,113 --> 00:38:27,744
I know it's hard
for you to see right now

730
00:38:27,784 --> 00:38:29,344
but I am trying to help.

731
00:38:29,388 --> 00:38:32,087
I think I've had quite enough
of your help.

732
00:38:32,127 --> 00:38:33,288
You've got to believe me.

733
00:38:33,329 --> 00:38:36,233
Commander Sisko
has found you a wonderful home.

734
00:38:36,268 --> 00:38:39,138
You betrayed me, Kira.

735
00:38:39,174 --> 00:38:40,472
No, I didn't.

736
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:43,277
I honestly believe
the provisional government

737
00:38:43,316 --> 00:38:44,945
made the right decision

738
00:38:44,986 --> 00:38:47,252
both for Bajor
and the Skrreeans.

739
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:50,785
If that's true,
we have nothing more to discuss.

740
00:38:53,871 --> 00:38:57,002
I was hoping
we could still be friends.

741
00:38:57,043 --> 00:39:02,509
So in other words, you came here
looking for forgiveness.

742
00:39:02,554 --> 00:39:05,151
Well, I don't forgive you.

743
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,966
Sisko to Kira.

744
00:39:09,001 --> 00:39:10,698
Go ahead, Commander.

745
00:39:10,737 --> 00:39:11,762
Is Haneek with you?

746
00:39:11,805 --> 00:39:13,000
Yes.

747
00:39:13,109 --> 00:39:15,204
I need both of you
in Ops immediately.

748
00:39:15,246 --> 00:39:17,113
Tumak has taken a ship.

749
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:19,017
He's headed for Bajor.

750
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,015
They're not responding, sir.

751
00:39:37,057 --> 00:39:38,491
Keep trying, Mr. O'Brien.

752
00:39:38,526 --> 00:39:39,687
How did this happen?

753
00:39:39,728 --> 00:39:41,459
With all the traffic
around the station

754
00:39:41,498 --> 00:39:43,900
Tumak and two of his friends
were able to slip away.

755
00:39:43,937 --> 00:39:45,702
We didn't even know
the ship was gone

756
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,300
until the Bajorans contacted us.

757
00:39:47,344 --> 00:39:50,680
Haneek, I need for you
to try to talk to your son.

758
00:39:50,717 --> 00:39:53,416
There's a high-energy radiation
leak in the port nacelle.

759
00:39:53,456 --> 00:39:55,050
I've tried
to make him aware of it

760
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:56,527
but he refuses
to acknowledge us.

761
00:39:56,562 --> 00:39:58,964
Major, open a channel
to the Skrreean vessel.

762
00:39:59,001 --> 00:40:00,196
Yes, sir.

763
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,635
Ready.

764
00:40:06,648 --> 00:40:08,311
Tumak?

765
00:40:09,721 --> 00:40:11,315
Listen to me.

766
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,421
Your ship's in danger.

767
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:18,638
Have him turn off
his engines and drift

768
00:40:18,672 --> 00:40:20,904
until the Bajorans
can tractor him in.

769
00:40:20,944 --> 00:40:24,645
Tumak, turn off your engines.

770
00:40:24,684 --> 00:40:29,148
You must turn
your engines off, now!

771
00:40:29,227 --> 00:40:31,163
He's not responding.

772
00:40:31,231 --> 00:40:33,896
Tumak, this is serious!

773
00:40:33,937 --> 00:40:35,566
Your life is in danger.

774
00:40:35,606 --> 00:40:38,544
The others who are with you,
their lives are in danger.

775
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:39,547
Please!

776
00:40:39,581 --> 00:40:40,708
Answer me!

777
00:40:42,687 --> 00:40:44,589
Sensors are detecting
two Bajoran vessels

778
00:40:44,624 --> 00:40:46,184
closing in on the Skrreean ship.

779
00:40:46,228 --> 00:40:47,628
Display it here.

780
00:40:47,664 --> 00:40:50,397
Mr. O'Brien, patch us
into the Bajoran interceptor.

781
00:40:50,436 --> 00:40:51,768
Aye, sir.

782
00:40:51,805 --> 00:40:53,365
...entered restricted space.

783
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,504
You must turn around
and leave immediately.

784
00:40:55,546 --> 00:40:56,809
Open a channel.

785
00:40:56,849 --> 00:40:58,910
This is Major Kira
Nerys on Deep Space 9.

786
00:40:58,953 --> 00:41:01,891
The Skrreean vessel has refused
to acknowledge our hails.

787
00:41:01,925 --> 00:41:04,726
Communications may be down.
You have to let them land.

788
00:41:04,764 --> 00:41:06,164
That's impossible, Major.

789
00:41:06,201 --> 00:41:07,669
We have strict orders
not to allow

790
00:41:07,704 --> 00:41:08,967
any Skrreean vessel to land.

791
00:41:09,007 --> 00:41:10,134
The pilot's just a boy.

792
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,941
He took the ship
without permission.

793
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,414
It's barely operational.

794
00:41:13,449 --> 00:41:15,282
We're not even sure
he'll make it back here.

795
00:41:15,319 --> 00:41:17,448
I'm sorry, Major,
but we have our orders.

796
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:18,458
Who gave you those orders?

797
00:41:18,492 --> 00:41:19,960
They come directly
from General Hazar.

798
00:41:19,996 --> 00:41:22,125
Dax, get me General Hazar
on Bajor.

799
00:41:22,167 --> 00:41:24,296
Tell his people
it's an emergency.

800
00:41:24,337 --> 00:41:25,805
I want to speak to him now.

801
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,808
Stand by, interceptor.

802
00:41:26,842 --> 00:41:28,471
General Hazar will be
countermanding

803
00:41:28,512 --> 00:41:29,605
those orders any minute.

804
00:41:29,648 --> 00:41:31,618
The interceptor is closing
on the Skrreean ship.

805
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:37,562
It's General Hazar, Benjamin.

806
00:41:37,597 --> 00:41:38,895
On screen.

807
00:41:38,933 --> 00:41:40,732
What is this about, Commander?

808
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:43,435
It's about the Skrreean vessel
that's approaching Bajor.

809
00:41:43,475 --> 00:41:45,945
I've already given the orders
to have it turned back.

810
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:48,382
That ship is being flown
by a child

811
00:41:48,419 --> 00:41:50,150
and it's leaking radiation.

812
00:41:50,189 --> 00:41:51,248
A child?

813
00:41:51,325 --> 00:41:52,588
...Skrreean ship.
Repeating.

814
00:41:52,627 --> 00:41:55,097
Return to the space station now.

815
00:41:55,132 --> 00:41:56,931
Have him shut down his engines.

816
00:41:56,969 --> 00:41:58,096
We'll tow him back.

817
00:41:58,138 --> 00:42:02,773
Tumak, please,
turn your engines off.

818
00:42:03,916 --> 00:42:05,214
Interceptor One,
what's going on?

819
00:42:05,253 --> 00:42:07,485
They've opened fire on us.
Taking evasive action.

820
00:42:07,523 --> 00:42:09,516
Tumak, don't do this!

821
00:42:09,561 --> 00:42:10,995
We've been hit!

822
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:12,557
Commander,
they're returning fire.

823
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,898
No!

824
00:42:13,936 --> 00:42:16,406
Disengage, interceptor!
Repeat, disengage.

825
00:42:16,441 --> 00:42:19,470
General, tell your pilots
to hold their fire.

826
00:42:19,514 --> 00:42:22,213
Relaying that order now.

827
00:42:30,736 --> 00:42:31,965
Interceptor One.

828
00:42:32,005 --> 00:42:34,168
The Skrreean ship exploded.

829
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:36,612
I didn't even think we hit it.

830
00:42:36,648 --> 00:42:40,383
The phaser beam must've
ignited the radiation leak.

831
00:42:42,627 --> 00:42:45,463
I'm very sorry, Commander.

832
00:42:45,499 --> 00:42:48,232
We all are, General.

833
00:43:20,899 --> 00:43:23,564
I just stopped by to wish
you luck on Draylon II.

834
00:43:23,605 --> 00:43:28,741
Haneek, I still believe
this is the best choice...

835
00:43:28,781 --> 00:43:31,115
for Bajor and for you.

836
00:43:31,153 --> 00:43:32,382
You still believe

837
00:43:32,422 --> 00:43:34,449
we would have been a burden
to your people?

838
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:37,723
Yes.

839
00:43:37,766 --> 00:43:41,068
I think you've made
a terrible mistake.

840
00:43:41,106 --> 00:43:42,074
All of you.

841
00:43:42,108 --> 00:43:44,135
Maybe we could
have helped you.

842
00:43:44,179 --> 00:43:46,742
Maybe we could have
helped each other.

843
00:43:46,784 --> 00:43:49,084
The Skrreeans are farmers, Kira.

844
00:43:49,122 --> 00:43:51,524
You have a famine
on your planet.

845
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:55,557
Perhaps we could have made
that peninsula bloom again.

846
00:43:55,602 --> 00:43:58,199
We'll never know, will we?

847
00:43:58,274 --> 00:44:01,110
50 years of Cardassian rule

848
00:44:01,147 --> 00:44:05,680
have made you all frightened
and suspicious.

849
00:44:05,722 --> 00:44:07,988
I feel sorry for you.

850
00:44:12,369 --> 00:44:14,805
You were right.

851
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:18,074
Bajor is not Kentanna.
