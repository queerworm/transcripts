1
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:10,469
I am Vedek Latha Mabrin

2
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:13,472
and I welcome you
to the Calash Retreat.

3
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:15,808
Today, we begin prayer
and meditation

4
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:18,602
as preparation
for our Days of Atonement.

5
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:22,397
May the Prophets walk with us
as we begin our journey.

6
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:13,448
(<i> groans</i> )

7
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:24,501
Have you been taking
your<i> makara</i> herbs?

8
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,460
Absolutely.

9
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,503
(<i> clears throat</i> )

10
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,713
Mostly.

11
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:29,381
Kira, you<i> have</i>
to take them.

12
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:30,925
Your progesterone levels
are way too low.

13
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:32,217
But if I take the herbs

14
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,093
then the sedatives
you gave me don't work.

15
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:35,637
The herbs do act
as a counteragent.

16
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:36,972
But I thought you said

17
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,473
you weren't having
any trouble sleeping

18
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:39,767
and that you didn't
need any sedatives.

19
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:40,809
I don't.

20
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,269
But, Julian,
those herbs taste

21
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:43,979
like something that crawled
out of Quark's ear.

22
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,022
Just take them.

23
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:45,940
All right.

24
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,608
ODO:
Major, may I have

25
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:48,734
a word with you?

26
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:51,111
We're finished here.

27
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,195
Sure.

28
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,746
I'm afraid I have
some very bad news.

29
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:03,874
One of the former members
of your resistance cell

30
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,876
has been killed on Bajor.

31
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:07,086
Latha Mabrin.

32
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:08,169
How?

33
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,047
It appears a small
hunter probe

34
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:13,550
was hidden inside
a ceremonial candle

35
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,095
and fired a disrupter blast.

36
00:02:16,095 --> 00:02:18,597
Do they have any suspects?

37
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:19,640
Too many.

38
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,600
Before he became a vedek

39
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,814
your friend was involved in some
very questionable activities.

40
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:28,649
Latha was a violent man

41
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,651
but then he found the Prophets.

42
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,987
And the last time
I talked to him,

43
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:35,280
he'd changed-- really changed.

44
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,992
I don't doubt that, Major,
but it would appear

45
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:41,495
that the violence of his past
has finally caught up with him.

46
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:45,124
Let me know
if you hear anything else.

47
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:46,291
Of course.

48
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:05,519
COMPUTER:
<i>Major Kira</i>

49
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,812
<i>there is one message</i>
<i>waiting for you.</i>

50
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,903
(<i> sighs</i> )

51
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,780
Play back message.

52
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,657
(<i> scrambled voice</i> ):
<i>That's one.</i>

53
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,620
Replay audio.

54
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,080
<i>That's one.</i>

55
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,042
Again.

56
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:29,584
<i>That's one.</i>

57
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,370
(<i> scrambled voice</i> ):
<i>That's one.</i>

58
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,956
As you might have guessed,

59
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:34,001
there's no point of origin
listed in the computer log.

60
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,211
When did we receive
this message?

61
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,213
It came over the primary
subspace antenna

62
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,840
at 1341 hours--

63
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,717
almost the same moment
Latha was killed on Bajor.

64
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,636
And you think
that this is a threat

65
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:45,846
to all the former members

66
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,555
of the Shakaar
resistance cell?

67
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:50,809
That's my working theory,
but I'm not ruling anything out.

68
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,894
Did anyone else
receive this message?

69
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,855
Not that we know of.

70
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,355
So obviously there's
some connection to me

71
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:57,858
but I don't know what it is.

72
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:01,028
I haven't even spoken
to Latha in two years.

73
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,488
I'm waiting for the preliminary
crime scene report

74
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,823
from the authorities on Bajor

75
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:07,117
before I begin
my own investigation,

76
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:10,537
but I'd like to increase
security here on the station

77
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:13,040
and initiate random checks

78
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,875
on all
incoming cargo.

79
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:15,959
Agreed.

80
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,294
I've contacted most

81
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,338
of the surviving members
of the Shakaar--

82
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:21,464
warned them to take
precautions just in case.

83
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,550
I'm sorry
about your friend.

84
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,926
He died serving the Prophets.

85
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,303
They'll take care of him.

86
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,929
I'm sure they will.

87
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,597
Keep me informed.

88
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,403
How you feeling?

89
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:47,074
Fine.

90
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,200
Exhausted.

91
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,743
I didn't get much sleep

92
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,703
and Julian's got me back
on those herbs again.

93
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:55,665
I know.

94
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,085
I heard you pacing all night.

95
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,087
I'm sorry.
Don't be.

96
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:02,047
I would have gotten up
and kept you company

97
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,382
but I figured you wanted
to be alone.

98
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:08,095
I couldn't stop thinking
about Latha.

99
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:12,224
All those firefights and bombs
he lived through

100
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:15,643
just to be killed
during a religious ceremony.

101
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,354
You know, if I wasn't pregnant,

102
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:20,399
I would be down on Bajor right
now trying to narrow down

103
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,400
the suspects.

104
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,776
You're safer on the station.

105
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,361
That's what's driving me crazy.

106
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,154
I'm sitting here
eating breakfast

107
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,573
while someone may be
hunting down my friends.

108
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,118
I'm a Major
in the Bajoran militia.

109
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:33,370
I should be down there
trying to protect them.

110
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,331
Right now, you're needed here,
protecting someone else.

111
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,920
Yeah, I...

112
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,631
guess I do have my hands full
at the moment.

113
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,800
ODO:
<i>Ops to Major Kira.</i>

114
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,468
Go ahead, Odo.

115
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,138
<i>There's another incoming</i>
<i>message for you, Major,</i>

116
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,514
<i>and they refuse to give</i>
<i>either their name</i>

117
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:54,599
<i>or location.</i>

118
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,101
I'm on my way.

119
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,896
We're having trouble
tracing the signal.

120
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,649
They're running it through
some kind of scrambler

121
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,901
using a phase-divergent
carrier wave.

122
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,569
Try to keep them talking.

123
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,910
This is Major Kira Nerys.

124
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,620
Who am I talking to?

125
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,581
<i>Nerys?</i>
<i>Is that really you?</i>

126
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,582
Fala?

127
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,209
<i>Are you alone?</i>

128
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,086
<i>I don't want anyone to hear me.</i>

129
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,671
<i>I think...</i>

130
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:27,174
<i>I think someone's trying</i>
<i>to trace my signal.</i>

131
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:29,801
Stand by.

132
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,472
She's a friend.

133
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:34,931
Her name is Trentin Fala.

134
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,724
One of the members
of your cell?

135
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,352
No.
Then why is
she hiding

136
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:39,560
her location?

137
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,771
I'd rather not
talk about it here

138
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,858
but trust me,
she's no threat to anyone.

139
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,567
Let me talk to her alone
and see what's going on.

140
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:01,041
I'm alone, and no one here
will trace your signal.

141
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,667
<i>You heard about Latha?</i>

142
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,253
<i>They killed him.</i>

143
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:10,008
<i>As he knelt in prayer,</i>
<i>they killed him.</i>

144
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,343
I know,

145
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:12,511
and the authorities

146
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:14,429
are investigating that
right now.

147
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,723
<i>They're going</i>
<i>to kill me, too, Nerys.</i>

148
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,058
<i>They've been watching me.</i>

149
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,642
Who's been watching you?

150
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,727
<i>I don't know.</i>

151
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:21,853
<i>But I feel it.</i>

152
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:22,937
<i>I need to get out of here.</i>

153
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,398
<i>Go somewhere safe.</i>

154
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,733
<i>Please, Nerys,</i>
<i>you've got to help me.</i>

155
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,235
<i>You always promised you'd help.</i>

156
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,194
All right, calm down.

157
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:30,904
I'll protect you.

158
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:34,157
You can stay here at the station
until all of this is over.

159
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,367
<i>Okay.</i>

160
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:37,327
Two of our officers
are returning

161
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:38,995
this afternoon from Starbase 63.

162
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:42,416
I'll reroute them to Bajor
and have them pick you up, okay?

163
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,791
<i>Okay.</i>

164
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,877
Their names are Worf
and Jadzia Dax.

165
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:47,170
They'll contact you
within the hour.

166
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,548
<i>I knew I could count on you.</i>

167
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:50,840
I'll see you soon.

168
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,228
You've been smirking ever since
we left the starbase.

169
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,146
I do not smirk.

170
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:08,525
But if I did, this would
be a good opportunity.

171
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,985
How was I supposed to know
that Captain Ramirez

172
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,946
was a three-time
<i>tongo</i> champion?

173
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,239
You might have asked

174
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,533
before mocking him
and then allowing him

175
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:18,159
to up the stakes
to a no-limit game.

176
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,079
I didn't lose that much.

177
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,206
Two bars of latinum.

178
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:25,500
I hope you have it.

179
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,335
I have it...

180
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,420
most of it.

181
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:31,839
Worf...?
No.

182
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,385
Fine.

183
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,345
I'll borrow it from Quark.

184
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,431
He likes me.

185
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:40,890
(<i> console beeping</i> )

186
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,810
Major Kira's friend is ready
for transport.

187
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,272
Quark may lend you
the money, but remember Rule
of Acquisition Number 111:

188
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,357
"Treat people
in your debt

189
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,235
like family-- exploit them."

190
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,695
You know the Rules
of Acquisition?

191
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:57,157
I'm a graduate
of Starfleet Academy.

192
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,575
I know many things.

193
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,578
Energizing.

194
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,333
There's a power surge
in the buffer.

195
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,793
Something is interfering
with the integration matrix.

196
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,003
I'm transferring

197
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,463
her pattern
to the secondary buffer.

198
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:12,964
Boost the gain
on the energizing coils.

199
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,217
It won't go any higher.

200
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,344
I'm losing her.

201
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,593
I'm sorry, Nerys.

202
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,928
I'm hearing that
a lot lately.

203
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,222
Can I have a moment?

204
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,306
Of course.

205
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,000
I wish there was something
I could say, Major.

206
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,752
Just tell me it
was an accident.

207
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:36,214
The Constable
thinks otherwise.

208
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:39,593
I believe she was killed
by a remat detonator.

209
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:40,968
It's a device

210
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:44,305
programmed to scramble
a transporter beam

211
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,307
during rematerialization.

212
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,726
They're typically

213
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:50,103
no more than two cubic
millimeters in size.

214
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,731
It could have been
hidden in her clothing

215
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:55,609
or injected
into her skin.

216
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,652
The device is typically used
by the Romulans.

217
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,862
However, it is sold
on the black market.

218
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,406
Why didn't the transporter
security system

219
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:02,365
detect the device?

220
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:03,742
DAX:
We're not sure.

221
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:06,994
The system is programmed
to scan for remats.

222
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,705
So whoever did this

223
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,331
has a sophisticated
understanding

224
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,999
of our security
protocols.

225
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:18,381
And a vendetta against
the Shakaar resistance cell.

226
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:19,840
I thought you said

227
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,469
that Trentin Fala wasn't
a member of the Shakaar.

228
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,844
She wasn't...

229
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,641
at least not officially.

230
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:33,396
Fala spent the occupation
cleaning floors

231
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:36,608
in a Cardassian records office
in Dakhur Province.

232
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:39,235
She passed us information
for years

233
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,112
without anyone catching on

234
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:45,866
but she was
always so afraid--

235
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,910
afraid she'd be caught
and executed...

236
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:53,667
but she never stopped.

237
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,251
I told her once

238
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:58,379
that I thought she was
braver than all of us

239
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,382
because she had to live
with her fear every day.

240
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,763
Even after
the occupation was over,

241
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,014
she didn't want
anyone to know

242
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,557
that she was
secretly helping us.

243
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:10,725
She was worried...

244
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,688
that someone would come looking

245
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,481
for her for revenge.

246
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,650
Looks like her fears
were well founded.

247
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,326
(<i> scrambled voice</i> ):
<i>That's two.</i>

248
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,038
<i>That's two.</i>

249
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,041
<i>That's two.</i>

250
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:39,045
<i>That's two.</i>

251
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,631
<i>That's two.</i>

252
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,760
Hello, Major.

253
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,221
I was just about to call you.

254
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,263
Quark, what is that?

255
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,432
I just found this padd

256
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:54,435
in a shipment of Saurian brandy
I just received.

257
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,312
It was coded for you

258
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:59,982
but somehow,
I accidentally activated it.

259
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,150
Give that to me.

260
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,405
<i>That's two.</i>

261
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,407
<i>That's two.</i>

262
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,491
<i>That's two.</i>

263
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,617
<i>That's...</i>

264
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,578
ODO:
Since she was an informant,

265
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:14,163
it stands to reason
that Fala was killed

266
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,666
because she was providing
information to the resistance--

267
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:20,628
information that the Shakaar
used to plan an attack

268
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,256
on a Cardassian target.

269
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:27,677
The killer is probably someone
who was either injured or who

270
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:28,636
lost a family member

271
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,346
or a friend
in that attack.

272
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,850
We planned dozens of attacks
based on Fala's information.

273
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,476
It could be any of them.

274
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,186
Not "any."

275
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,063
We're dealing
with an operation

276
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,232
in which you played
a prominent part.

277
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,735
Now, perhaps
you could make a list

278
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,820
of all the attacks
by the Shakaar

279
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,363
in which
you participated.

280
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,740
It's a long list.

281
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,908
(<i> console beeping rapidly</i> )

282
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:53,536
Someone is accessing

283
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:55,371
the security database.

284
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,915
Can you trace it?

285
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:58,875
No.

286
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,710
(<i> scrambled voice</i> ):
<i>That's three.</i>

287
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,879
Mobara.

288
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,004
He was in the Shakaar.

289
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,339
Where does Mobara live?

290
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,801
Um, Musilla province,
at the University...

291
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,594
Engineering School.

292
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:12,513
I'm sending an emergency message
to the authorities in Musilla.

293
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,598
Maybe it's not too late.

294
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:17,977
Are you all right?

295
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,813
No, I'm not all right!

296
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:22,523
I haven't slept in three days,
someone is killing my friends

297
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,691
and my back...

298
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:33,993
Sorry.

299
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,788
No apology necessary, Major.

300
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,372
(<i> console beeping</i> )

301
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,332
(<i> sighs</i> )

302
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,416
They haven't been able

303
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,501
to contact Mobara

304
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,085
so they're sending
a search party

305
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,045
to the University right now.

306
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,714
They'll let us know
what happens.

307
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,382
Major,

308
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,134
if I may make a suggestion--

309
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,553
why don't you return
to your quarters

310
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:53,805
and rest for now?

311
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:55,264
It may be several hours

312
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,351
before they're able
to make a complete search.

313
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,436
Maybe you're right.

314
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:08,068
But let me know
the moment you hear something.

315
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,153
You have my word.

316
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,689
(<i> sighs</i> )

317
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,440
I'm going to lie down.

318
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,568
Help yourself
to the replicator
if you're hungry.

319
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:49,986
Thank you, Major.

320
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,868
(<i> sighs</i> )

321
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:59,662
(<i> thud</i> )

322
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,753
(<i> thumping</i> )

323
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,085
(<i> clatter</i> )

324
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,023
Don't move!
Hold it.

325
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:10,190
Furel?

326
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,068
Nerys?

327
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:13,903
(<i> sighs</i> )

328
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:17,197
Oh! You're lucky
I didn't shoot you.

329
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:18,866
Well, I could say
the same about you.

330
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,451
What are you doing
creeping around

331
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:21,786
in a dark room with a phaser?

332
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:23,037
I live here.

333
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:24,204
What about him?

334
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,205
Oh... This is

335
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,457
Lieutenant Brilgar.

336
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:27,708
He's station security

337
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,793
here to protect me.

338
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:30,753
Oh. Sorry.

339
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:32,922
You know these people,
Major?

340
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:35,133
I'm afraid so.
This is Furel, Lupaza.

341
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:37,551
We were in the same
resistance cell.

342
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:40,262
Brilgar, sorry about the...

343
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,514
Yeah, yeah.

344
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,265
I'll be outside
if you need me.

345
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,768
Thank you.

346
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,145
How did you get in?

347
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:49,022
We just installed
a new security system.

348
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,815
And a pretty good one
it is, too.

349
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:53,109
But they have not yet
invented the system

350
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,318
that Lupaza cannot beat.

351
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,319
(<i> laughs</i> )

352
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,737
It took some work

353
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:59,239
but I managed to retune
the transporter scrambler.

354
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,408
You beamed in?
From where?

355
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,494
We stowed away
aboard a transport ship

356
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:05,579
making a run from Bajor.

357
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:06,914
Just before it docked,

358
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,542
I accessed the station
personnel records.

359
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,878
We beamed into the bedroom
about five minutes ago.

360
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,671
We heard
somebody moving around in here.

361
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,089
I thought it was you.

362
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:16,883
But it turned out to be
a man with a phaser--

363
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:18,425
FUREL:
And I tried
to tell her

364
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,302
that we should contact you
before we came--

365
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,679
You did not.

366
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,597
I should have you both
thrown in the brig...

367
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,601
but I'm glad to see you.

368
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,938
(<i> chuckling</i> )

369
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,648
It's good to see you.

370
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,316
(<i> whispering</i> ):
Go get it.

371
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,943
What? Oh...

372
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,114
Can I?

373
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:41,574
Oh.

374
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,661
How much longer?

375
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:46,787
A couple of weeks.

376
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:47,747
Been sneezing?

377
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:48,915
Off and on.

378
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,332
The doctor's
giving me something.

379
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,543
But before we get
too deep into baby talk

380
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:55,046
I had another
message today.

381
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:56,380
This time, it's Mobara.

382
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,174
Dead?
We don't
know yet.

383
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:00,593
There's a search party out
right now looking for him.

384
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:01,886
Do you have any suspects?

385
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:04,180
No.
Well, when
you do you let us know.

386
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,347
That's why
we're here--

387
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,474
to find out who's doing this...

388
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,936
and take care of it.

389
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:13,189
I can't send you out
like some assassination squad.

390
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,942
You don't have
to send us anywhere.

391
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:17,526
You just give us the name.

392
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,361
We'll take care of the rest.

393
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,988
The occupation is over.

394
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,157
We can't go around
fighting private wars.

395
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:24,283
Times have changed.

396
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,492
We have got
to change with it.

397
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,493
Leave this
for the authorities.

398
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:27,536
Authorities?!

399
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,621
Maybe you feel
that way now

400
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,039
but trust me

401
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:34,585
when you find out
who killed Latha and Fala

402
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:36,336
and maybe now Mobara,

403
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,756
you're not going to want
to leave it to someone else. 

404
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,174
You're going to want him dead

405
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:42,301
and you're going
to want<i> us</i> to do it.

406
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:45,805
(<i> sighs</i> )

407
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,514
Maybe so,

408
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:49,683
but we're not at that point yet.

409
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:50,768
Hmm.

410
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:54,688
What's in the box?

411
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,316
It's for you.

412
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,692
For me?

413
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:02,029
A gift.

414
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,114
<i>Makara</i> herbs.

415
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:04,698
You're...

416
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:07,243
You're supposed to take them
during your pregnancy.

417
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:08,828
LUPAZA:
She knows
what they're for.

418
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:11,789
We thought
you might have trouble

419
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:13,916
getting fresh herbs
on the station

420
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,417
so we picked them last night.

421
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,587
Thanks.

422
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,884
Really... thank you.

423
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:29,098
Well, if you're staying,
I better find you some quarters.

424
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,516
We're staying right here

425
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:32,643
where we can keep
an eye on you...

426
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:34,270
on both of you.

427
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,604
Yeah, we'll sleep out here.

428
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,106
The couch is
a little short

429
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:38,482
but it's probably

430
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,109
as comfortable as our bed.

431
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:43,779
Well, since Keiko's visiting
her parents with Molly,

432
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,323
I guess there's room.

433
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:47,825
Hold it!

434
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:48,909
It's all right!

435
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:59,545
Miles...

436
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,379
we have houseguests.

437
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:13,017
ODO:
They found his body
about two hours ago...

438
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:15,353
or at least what was left of it.

439
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:18,272
Mobara had
a micro-explosive implanted

440
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,233
just behind
his right ear.

441
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:22,318
How could someone get
close enough

442
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:24,945
to implant something
behind someone's ear

443
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,197
and not get caught?

444
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:28,241
I doubt he was ever
near Mobara.

445
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:31,618
The killer's shown a pattern
of using remote control devices.

446
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:35,455
He was probably using some sort
of hunter probe

447
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,541
and injected Mobara as he slept.

448
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:40,002
What are we dealing with here--
a professional assassin?

449
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:42,129
Well, that was
my initial thought,

450
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,505
but a professional

451
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,092
would never be sending
anonymous messages.

452
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:47,676
No, our killer is someone

453
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,929
with a very personal
stake in this--

454
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,222
someone who is trying

455
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:53,140
to make a point
to Major Kira.

456
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,475
And once he drives
his point home?

457
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:57,603
He'll try
to kill her, too.

458
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,107
(<i> scrambled voice</i> ):
<i>That's one.</i>

459
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:03,192
<i>That's two.</i>

460
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:05,443
<i>That's three.</i>

461
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:06,904
It doesn't sound natural.

462
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:08,530
No kidding.

463
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,949
I mean, I know they're using

464
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:12,034
some kind of scrambler
to disguise the voice,

465
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:13,577
but there's
something else.

466
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,204
The rhythms don't
sound natural.

467
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:16,496
More like a composite of words

468
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:18,040
from different speeches
put together.

469
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,417
You can tell that
through all the distortion?

470
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:20,918
It's the lobes.

471
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:23,712
The intonation and phrasing
are slightly off.

472
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:24,922
I've made it a policy

473
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,506
never to argue
with someone's lobes.

474
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:27,883
KIRA:
All right

475
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,509
let's say these are
composite messages.

476
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:30,636
Does that help us?

477
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:31,971
Maybe.

478
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,139
Since the first word

479
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:34,723
of all three messages
is the same,

480
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:38,102
let's assume it's simply
been copied three times.

481
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:39,561
That gives me a reference

482
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:42,189
to begin screening out
the electronic interference.

483
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:45,985
<i>That's... that's... that's...</i>

484
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,485
<i>that's...</i>

485
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:48,612
NOG:
It's a female.

486
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,281
<i>that's...</i>

487
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:51,657
And it's not Cardassian.

488
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,284
You're sure?

489
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:54,910
Uh, all right.

490
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,120
All right.

491
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,080
<i>...that's... that's...</i>

492
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,040
It's... Bajoran.

493
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,084
I know that voice.

494
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:04,711
Can I hear the rest
of the words?

495
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:07,840
<i>That's one.</i>

496
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,507
<i>That's two.</i>

497
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:11,260
<i>That's three...</i>
It's me.

498
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,928
<i>That's one...</i>

499
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,930
He's using my voice.

500
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,474
(<i> beeping</i> )

501
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:19,268
There's been an explosion
in the Habitat Ring.

502
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:20,311
Location.

503
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:22,062
Level 5,
Section 21-Alpha.

504
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,316
The O'Brien's quarters.

505
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:26,524
Go to Red Alert.

506
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:27,609
Stop all incoming
and outgoing ships

507
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:28,526
until further notice.

508
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:29,611
NOG:
Aye, sir.

509
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:30,988
Dax to Infirmary.

510
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:33,782
Dr. Bashir report
to Habitat Ring Level 5

511
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,660
Section 21-Alpha--
medical emergency.

512
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,577
Report.

513
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:38,620
There's been
an explosion

514
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,663
in O'Brien's
quarters.

515
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,081
There's a hull breach.

516
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,958
The compartment is
venting air into space.

517
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,001
Casualties?

518
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,461
No word yet.

519
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:47,380
I'm having trouble
scanning through the debris.

520
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,881
Where's Kira?

521
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,758
MAN:
Major, you can't go in.

522
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:52,801
There's a hull breach--

523
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:53,844
Get out of my way!

524
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,015
Major, please...

525
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:04,522
Major, no.

526
00:26:04,522 --> 00:26:06,440
You'll vent
the whole corridor.

527
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:11,445
(<i> gasps</i> )

528
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:13,906
(<i> groaning</i> )

529
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,798
Nerys?

530
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:34,885
Nerys, can you hear me?

531
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:37,430
Julian...

532
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,139
You're in the Infirmary.

533
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,640
(<i> gasps</i> ):
The baby...?

534
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,310
He's fine.

535
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,146
You suffered
a placental laceration

536
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,566
and then you began
to hemorrhage

537
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:50,776
but I've repaired
the damage.

538
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,610
You're going
to be all right.

539
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:53,695
(<i> groans</i> )

540
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,155
(<i> sighs</i> )

541
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,743
Lupaza and Furel...

542
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:02,413
they're dead,
aren't they?

543
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:04,582
I'm afraid so.

544
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,461
Miles?

545
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:10,963
He wasn't there
when it happened.

546
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,841
Did they die quickly?

547
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,594
Instantly.

548
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:20,680
ODO:
Doctor, may I?

549
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,309
BASHIR:
I'll be right outside.

550
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:30,274
I was 13 when I joined
the resistance.

551
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:33,444
I'd been hanging around
the Shakaar base camp

552
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:36,071
for a couple of weeks--
you know, running errands

553
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,282
cleaning weapons,
that kind of thing.

554
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:42,077
Then one night, they
had an ambush planned

555
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:45,581
and they were a man short,
so I volunteered

556
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:50,503
but everyone thought
I was too young, too small.

557
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:56,091
Lupaza stuck up for me.

558
00:27:56,091 --> 00:28:00,179
She said I had
the heart of sinoraptor

559
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:04,724
<i>and</i> they didn't have
much choice.

560
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:06,810
Furel made some kind of joke.

561
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,812
I don't remember what it was

562
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,649
but I do remember
that Lupaza hit him.

563
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:13,817
She was always doing that.

564
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:17,154
They loved each other
in some way.

565
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:20,949
But it was up to Shakaar,

566
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:24,702
and he stared at me
for a long time

567
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:28,332
before he decided
I was big enough

568
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:31,377
to carry a phaser rifle
after all.

569
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:36,923
So we set the ambush up
along a ridgeline that night

570
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:39,009
and waited.

571
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:40,719
I was so cold.

572
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,388
My hands were shaking.

573
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:45,307
I was so afraid that one of them
would look at me

574
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:46,975
and think that I was nervous

575
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:50,270
that I kept biting my fingers
to keep the blood flowing.

576
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,814
We must have
waited there

577
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,358
three or four hours

578
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:55,817
before the
skimmer appeared.

579
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:56,985
It set down

580
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,321
right where Furel
said it would.

581
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:02,908
And when that hatch opened

582
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:05,285
and that first Cardassian
appeared,

583
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:06,579
I just started firing

584
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:08,121
and I didn't stop

585
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:11,833
'till I'd discharged
the entire power cell.

586
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,004
When it was all over, I...

587
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,840
I was so relieved
that I hadn't let anyone down

588
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,926
I, I was giddy.

589
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:25,138
Furel told me to stop grinning,
that it made me look younger,

590
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,473
but I couldn't help it.

591
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,603
I was one of them.

592
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:35,315
I was in the resistance.

593
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:42,406
Lupaza made me this...

594
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:45,867
out of some of the metal
from that skimmer.

595
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:53,459
How were they killed?

596
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:56,795
Someone attached
a small hunter probe

597
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,590
to the hull
of a Talavian freighter.

598
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:02,635
When the ship docked
at the station,

599
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:05,262
the probe detached itself
and then began a visual scan

600
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:07,889
of every room
in the Habitat Ring.

601
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,392
Once the probe found
its assigned targets,

602
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:14,354
it attached itself to the window
and exploded.

603
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:26,700
Do you have any leads?

604
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,076
My sources on Cardassia

605
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,788
have given me a list
of possible suspects.

606
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:33,499
They all have
the computer skills

607
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:36,669
the opportunity, and the motive
to carry out

608
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:38,378
these attacks.

609
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,589
You must have called in
a lot of favors.

610
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:42,549
One or two.

611
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,635
How many people
are on the list now?

612
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:46,470
Twenty-five.

613
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,596
Can I see it?

614
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:50,056
Not... just yet.

615
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:53,893
I'd like to...
narrow it a little.

616
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:57,397
You're afraid I'm going
to take the names

617
00:30:57,397 --> 00:31:00,192
and go charging off after them.

618
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:02,944
Something like that.

619
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,154
(<i> laughing</i> )

620
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:06,323
You're right.

621
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:09,242
I probably would.

622
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:13,246
I'm going to find
the person that's done this.

623
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:15,791
I promise you that.

624
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:18,043
I know you will, Odo.

625
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:21,963
Keep me informed.

626
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:24,216
Absolutely.

627
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,816

637
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:16,620
ODO:
She's obviously going after
the suspects on the list

638
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,204
but she erased their names
from my computer file

639
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,748
when she got them,

640
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:21,625
so there's no way
to know where she's headed.

641
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:22,751
Prepare the<i> Defiant.</i>

642
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:24,085
I want to leave
in ten minutes

643
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,754
see if we can pick up
her ion trial.

644
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:26,964
It will be difficult.

645
00:33:26,964 --> 00:33:28,465
Our sensor logs
show Major Kira

646
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:30,759
masked her engine emissions
with a polaron field.

647
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:31,969
The runabout's particle--

648
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:33,386
I know what the
difficulties are.

649
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,013
You have your orders.
Dismissed.

650
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,473
Aye, sir.

651
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:40,101

awakens in the harsh truth

660
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:22,996
It squirms in the glare,

661
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:26,083
afraid of the light
that pins it to the chair

662
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:28,710
like a needle through its heart.

663
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,796
Its heart beats faster...

664
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:32,089
Who's there?

665
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:34,800
Silaran, is that you?

666
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,676
Panic starts
to creep into its soul.

667
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:37,886
Does it understand?

668
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:40,722
Or is it so blinded
by the light

669
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:43,892
that it can think only
of returning

670
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:46,519
to the velvet cloak of darkness?

671
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,980
No matter.

672
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,899
Perhaps it is better
that it doesn't realize

673
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:52,609
how close death has come.

674
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:55,821
But make no mistake,
there is no escape.

675
00:35:55,821 --> 00:36:00,659
It has reached the end
and soon it<i> will</i> die.

676
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:09,292
What's the matter, Silaran?

677
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,961
Are you so afraid
of a pregnant woman

678
00:36:10,961 --> 00:36:13,338
in a restraining field
you have to hide in the dark?

679
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:16,257
It bears its tiny fangs,
hoping for a chance to strike--

680
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:19,636
to sink its teeth deep
into the flesh of its tormentor,

681
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:21,513
but that chance will never come.

682
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:22,472
You better hope

683
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:23,640
I don't get that chance.

684
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,017
And somewhere
beneath the gleam

685
00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:27,019
of hatred in those eyes

686
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:30,647
lurks the certain knowledge
of its impending death,

687
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:33,775
and it begins
to know fear.

688
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:35,735
I'm not afraid of you.

689
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,278
I'm not some coward

690
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,405
who's been sending anonymous
messages and bombs

691
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:41,199
to murder innocent people.

692
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,493
No, Kira, I didn't
murder anyone!

693
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:44,494
<i>You</i> did.

694
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:46,705
<i>You</i> killed them all.

695
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,166
There.

696
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:51,417
That wasn't so hard, was it?

697
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,419
Now we can talk.

698
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:54,504
Talk and lies

699
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:55,463
won't help you.

700
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,715
You're in the light,

701
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:59,384
and the light
reveals the truth.

702
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:05,682
And the light shows me no regret

703
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:08,185
in those eyes, no compassion.

704
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:11,897
You want me to...
feel compassion for you?

705
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:15,441
You murdered five people.

706
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,402
What compassion
did you show to them?

707
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:18,403
Unrepentant.

708
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:19,612
How unfortunate.

709
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,531
I thought you might
have changed...

710
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:25,368
might have found a path
out of the darkness.

711
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,453
What am I supposed
to feel repentant for?

712
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:28,872
What are you talking about?

713
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:30,957
<i>That</i> is part of your guilt.

714
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:33,168
<i>You</i> did this to me...

715
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:35,795
and you don't
even know

716
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,839
who... I... am.

717
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:42,594
So you were wounded
during an attack I carried out

718
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:44,554
when I was part
of the resistance

719
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:46,932
and I'm supposed to feel guilty?

720
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:49,559
We were at war, Silaran.

721
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:53,688
15 million Bajorans<i> died</i>
during the occupation

722
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,149
and you want me
to feel sorry for you?

723
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:57,442
No, I wasn't part
of your war.

724
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,027
I was an innocent.

725
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:01,071
I wasn't even
<i>in</i> the military.

726
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:03,198
Do you know what
I did on Bajor?

727
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:04,741
I was a servant.

728
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:10,496
I cleaned uniforms
for Gul Pirak.

729
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:11,998
Gul Pirak...

730
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,461
Commander of the weapons depot
at Hathon.

731
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:19,172
I'm glad that you remember.

732
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:22,884
Now, do you remember...

733
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:24,261
what<i> you</i> did?

734
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:26,972
How you put
a plasma charge

735
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:30,558
outside his bedroom window
in the middle of the night?

736
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,477
I remember.

737
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:34,395
He executed

738
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:37,899
15 Bajoran farmers because
they refused to display

739
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:40,693
the Cardassian banner
outside their homes.

740
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:41,945
Trentin Fala showed you

741
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:43,947
how to circumvent
the defense system.

742
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:47,075
Latha Mabrin built
the plasma charge.

743
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:48,118
Furel

744
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:50,078
and Lupaza stood
guard outside

745
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,413
while<i> you</i> crept up to the house.

746
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,624
None of us liked killing.

747
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:57,294
We were fighting
for our freedom against--

748
00:38:57,294 --> 00:38:59,129
You vaporized
the entire east wing!

749
00:38:59,129 --> 00:39:00,713
12 Cardassians were killed

750
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:04,467
including Gul Pirak's
entire family.

751
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:07,512
<i>23</i> others
were crippled.

752
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:10,682
Don't you feel guilty?

753
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:13,476
Don't you feel ashamed
of what you did?

754
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,645
None of you belonged on Bajor.

755
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:17,522
It wasn't your world.

756
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:20,942
For 50 years,
you raped our planet

757
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:23,528
and you killed our people,
you lived on our land

758
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:25,197
and you took the food
out of our mouths

759
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:27,157
and I don't care whether you
held a phaser in your hand

760
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:29,617
or you ironed shirts
for a living.

761
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,620
You were<i> all</i> guilty, and you
were<i> all</i> legitimate targets!

762
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,747
That's what makes<i> you</i>
a murderer--

763
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:37,292
indiscriminate killing,
no sense of morality,

764
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:40,003
no thought given to
the consequences of your action.

765
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:42,839
<i>That's</i> what makes us different.

766
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:44,216
I was a soldier!

767
00:39:44,216 --> 00:39:46,759
You're just a bitter old man
out for revenge.

768
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:49,762
I am bringing the guilty
to justice...

769
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:56,769
and unlike you, I take care
to protect the innocent.

770
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:59,272
I could have killed
every monk in that cavern

771
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:01,566
or everyone
on the runabout

772
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,360
or half the population

773
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,819
of Deep Space 9, but I didn't.

774
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,445
Only the guilty have died.

775
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,409
And that is why...

776
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:15,747
although your actions
have condemned<i> you,</i>

777
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:18,041
the life
of your child

778
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:19,334
will be spared.

779
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:22,628
What does that mean?

780
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,672
What does that mean?!

781
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,800
The creature's diseased mind
cannot understand its plight.

782
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,636
Its imagination
is too limited

783
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:33,765
to perceive the truth--
it cannot be saved.

784
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:36,684
But there is still hope
for the child.

785
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,104
It could be taken from the womb

786
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:40,438
and raised
in the light.

787
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,940
Listen to me, Silaran.

788
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,317
The child I'm carrying,
it isn't Bajoran--

789
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,360
it's human.

790
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,778
It has unique medical needs.

791
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,196
If you force me to give
birth now, you risk--

792
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:50,323
The creature's cries
grow louder

793
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:51,866
but no one can hear them.

794
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:55,578
All that remains is to bring
the child into the light

795
00:40:55,578 --> 00:41:00,417
and discard the diseased
carcass of the mother

796
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:04,254
before it can infect
its offspring.

797
00:41:04,254 --> 00:41:07,215
You can't bring it
into the light-- not yet!

798
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:09,092
Dr. Bashir said
if I don't have at least

799
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:11,261
three more weeks--
It's time.

800
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:19,102
We both agree
this baby is an innocent.

801
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:20,979
Don't put him at risk,
please, Silaran.

802
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:24,565
Don't worry.

803
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:28,278
I promise that I'll take care
of the child...

804
00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:33,699
and that I'll teach him
the difference between darkness

805
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:34,826
and light.

806
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:38,621
Wait.

807
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:42,792
Please, I'm begging you.

808
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:46,879
At least give me a sedative.

809
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:48,131
Show some compassion.

810
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:49,632
Don't just cut me open.

811
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:58,183
All right.

812
00:41:58,183 --> 00:42:00,935
I'll show more mercy
than you have.

813
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,023
(<i> sighs</i> )

814
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:09,777
Take a good look

815
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,404
at my face, Kira!

816
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:14,866
I want it to be
the last thing

817
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,368
you see.

818
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,998
The creature slept...

819
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:25,043
dreaming its dark dreams

820
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:28,546
and happy to be
out of the light.

821
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,798
The innocent life
it held

822
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,758
would awaken
in brilliance...

823
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:37,847
and never...

824
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:40,183
know darkness...

825
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:41,351
again.

826
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:44,687
Oh!

827
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,027
(<i> grunts</i> )

828
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:18,679
Are you all right?

829
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,349
She's fine

830
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:23,601
but there's a large amount
of merfadon in her system.

831
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:26,438
"Merfadon"?
It's a sedative.

832
00:43:26,438 --> 00:43:28,606
But the<i> makara</i> herbs
she's been taking

833
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,316
have counteracted the effect.

834
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:31,984
I take it this is our assassin.

835
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:34,362
Why did he give you
a sedative?

836
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,740
He wanted
to protect the innocent...

837
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:42,703
and separate the darkness
from the light...

838
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,665
but he didn't realize...

839
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:50,378
the light

840
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:52,589
only shines
in the dark

841
00:43:52,589 --> 00:43:55,758
and sometimes innocence is
just an excuse for the guilty.

842
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,565
Let's go home.

843
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,527
Sisko to<i> Defiant.</i>

844
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:15,612
<i>Go ahead.</i>

845
00:44:15,612 --> 00:44:17,947
Four to beam up.

846
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:19,491
Energize.
