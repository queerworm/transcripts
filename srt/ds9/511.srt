1
00:00:08,878 --> 00:00:10,848
I am Vedek Latha Mabrin

2
00:00:10,882 --> 00:00:13,855
and I welcome you
to the Calash Retreat.

3
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:16,190
Today, we begin prayer
and meditation

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,959
as preparation
for our Days of Atonement.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,667
May the Prophets walk with us
as we begin our journey.

6
00:01:22,573 --> 00:01:25,101
Have you been taking
your <i>makara</i> herbs?

7
00:01:25,145 --> 00:01:26,113
Absolutely.

8
00:01:27,149 --> 00:01:28,117
Mostly.

9
00:01:28,152 --> 00:01:29,712
Kira, you have to take them.

10
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,521
Your progesterone levels
are way too low.

11
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,585
But if I take the herbs

12
00:01:32,628 --> 00:01:34,530
then the sedatives
you gave me don't work.

13
00:01:34,566 --> 00:01:36,297
The herbs do act
as a counteragent.

14
00:01:36,404 --> 00:01:37,497
But I thought you said

15
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:38,940
you weren't having
any trouble sleeping

16
00:01:38,976 --> 00:01:40,445
and that you didn't
need any sedatives.

17
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,447
I don't.

18
00:01:41,482 --> 00:01:42,677
But, Julian, those herbs taste

19
00:01:42,717 --> 00:01:44,653
like something that crawled
out of Quark's ear.

20
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:45,314
Just take them.

21
00:01:45,389 --> 00:01:46,550
All right.

22
00:01:46,593 --> 00:01:49,087
Major, may I have
a word with you?

23
00:01:49,131 --> 00:01:51,329
We're finished here.

24
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:52,736
Sure.

25
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,190
I'm afraid I have
some very bad news.

26
00:02:01,224 --> 00:02:04,197
One of the former members
of your resistance cell

27
00:02:04,231 --> 00:02:06,133
has been killed on Bajor.

28
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:07,569
Latha Mabrin.

29
00:02:07,605 --> 00:02:08,573
How?

30
00:02:08,607 --> 00:02:10,440
It appears a small hunter probe

31
00:02:10,478 --> 00:02:13,815
was hidden inside
a ceremonial candle

32
00:02:13,852 --> 00:02:16,323
and fired a disrupter blast.

33
00:02:16,425 --> 00:02:18,896
Do they have any suspects?

34
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:19,921
Too many.

35
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:21,936
Before he became a vedek

36
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:27,107
your friend was involved in some
very questionable activities.

37
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:28,947
Latha was a violent man

38
00:02:28,986 --> 00:02:31,013
but then he found the Prophets.

39
00:02:31,057 --> 00:02:33,358
And the last time
I talked to him

40
00:02:33,395 --> 00:02:35,764
he'd changed... really changed.

41
00:02:35,801 --> 00:02:38,364
I don't doubt that, Major,
but it would appear

42
00:02:38,406 --> 00:02:42,005
that the violence of his past
has finally caught up with him.

43
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,380
Let me know
if you hear anything else.

44
00:02:45,488 --> 00:02:46,683
Of course.

45
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:05,891
Major Kira

46
00:03:05,933 --> 00:03:08,234
there is one message
waiting for you.

47
00:03:15,254 --> 00:03:17,224
Play back message.

48
00:03:17,258 --> 00:03:19,194
That's one.

49
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:24,205
Replay audio.

50
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,641
That's one.

51
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,407
Again.

52
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,443
That's one.

53
00:05:27,337 --> 00:05:28,966
That's one.

54
00:05:29,008 --> 00:05:30,443
As you might have guessed

55
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:33,451
there's no point of origin
listed in the computer log.

56
00:05:33,485 --> 00:05:35,581
When did we receive
this message?

57
00:05:35,622 --> 00:05:37,615
It came over the primary
subspace antenna

58
00:05:37,661 --> 00:05:39,290
at 1341 hours...

59
00:05:39,331 --> 00:05:42,098
almost the same moment
Latha was killed on Bajor.

60
00:05:42,137 --> 00:05:44,004
And you think
that this is a threat

61
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:47,014
to all the former members
of the Shakaar resistance cell?

62
00:05:47,048 --> 00:05:50,180
That's my working theory,
but I'm not ruling anything out.

63
00:05:50,255 --> 00:05:52,282
Did anyone else
receive this message?

64
00:05:52,326 --> 00:05:54,353
Not that we know of.

65
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:56,162
So obviously there's
some connection to me

66
00:05:56,201 --> 00:05:57,396
but I don't know what it is.

67
00:05:57,437 --> 00:06:00,467
I haven't even spoken
to Latha in two years.

68
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,845
I'm waiting for the preliminary
crime scene report

69
00:06:02,882 --> 00:06:04,146
from the authorities on Bajor

70
00:06:04,219 --> 00:06:06,520
before I begin
my own investigation

71
00:06:06,557 --> 00:06:09,894
but I'd like to increase
security here on the station

72
00:06:09,931 --> 00:06:14,168
and initiate random checks
on all incoming cargo.

73
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:15,641
Agreed.

74
00:06:15,677 --> 00:06:16,645
I've contacted most

75
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:18,775
of the surviving members
of the Shakaar...

76
00:06:18,817 --> 00:06:20,844
warned them to take
precautions just in case.

77
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:22,950
I'm sorry about your friend.

78
00:06:22,993 --> 00:06:24,394
He died serving the Prophets.

79
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,694
They'll take care of him.

80
00:06:25,732 --> 00:06:27,292
I'm sure they will.

81
00:06:27,336 --> 00:06:29,272
Keep me informed.

82
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,804
How you feeling?

83
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:44,932
Fine.

84
00:06:46,511 --> 00:06:47,672
Exhausted.

85
00:06:47,714 --> 00:06:49,206
I didn't get much sleep

86
00:06:49,251 --> 00:06:52,224
and Julian's got me back
on those herbs again.

87
00:06:53,727 --> 00:06:55,128
I know.

88
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,567
I heard you pacing all night.

89
00:06:57,603 --> 00:06:59,573
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

90
00:06:59,607 --> 00:07:01,440
I would have gotten up
and kept you company

91
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:03,072
but I figured you wanted
to be alone.

92
00:07:04,985 --> 00:07:07,548
I couldn't stop thinking
about Latha.

93
00:07:07,591 --> 00:07:11,726
All those firefights and bombs
he lived through

94
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:15,228
just to be killed
during a religious ceremony.

95
00:07:15,308 --> 00:07:16,868
You know, if I wasn't pregnant

96
00:07:16,912 --> 00:07:19,885
I would be down on Bajor right
now trying to narrow down

97
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:20,886
the suspects.

98
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,253
You're safer on the station.

99
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,850
That's what's driving me crazy.

100
00:07:23,894 --> 00:07:25,659
I'm sitting here
eating breakfast

101
00:07:25,697 --> 00:07:28,134
while someone may be
hunting down my friends.

102
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,607
I'm a Major
in the Bajoran militia.

103
00:07:30,642 --> 00:07:32,909
I should be down there
trying to protect them.

104
00:07:32,947 --> 00:07:36,614
Right now, you're needed here,
protecting someone else.

105
00:07:39,495 --> 00:07:41,488
Yeah, I...

106
00:07:41,532 --> 00:07:45,439
guess I do have my hands full
at the moment.

107
00:07:45,474 --> 00:07:46,807
Ops to Major Kira.

108
00:07:46,844 --> 00:07:48,039
Go ahead, Odo.

109
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,677
There's another incoming message
for you, Major

110
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:53,020
and they refuse to give
either their name

111
00:07:53,058 --> 00:07:54,117
or location.

112
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,290
I'm on my way.

113
00:07:57,634 --> 00:07:59,536
We're having trouble
tracing the signal.

114
00:07:59,572 --> 00:08:02,135
They're running it through
some kind of scrambler

115
00:08:02,178 --> 00:08:04,274
using a phase-divergent
carrier wave.

116
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,182
Try to keep them talking.

117
00:08:11,665 --> 00:08:13,294
This is Major Kira Nerys.

118
00:08:13,402 --> 00:08:15,167
Who am I talking to?

119
00:08:15,207 --> 00:08:18,043
Nerys?
Is that really you?

120
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,047
Fala?

121
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,675
Are you alone?

122
00:08:20,718 --> 00:08:22,882
I don't want anyone to hear me.

123
00:08:22,923 --> 00:08:24,222
I think...

124
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:27,129
I think someone's trying
to trace my signal.

125
00:08:28,135 --> 00:08:29,798
Stand by.

126
00:08:31,943 --> 00:08:32,911
She's a friend.

127
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:34,346
Her name is Trentin Fala.

128
00:08:34,449 --> 00:08:36,351
One of the members
of your cell?

129
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,946
- No.
- Then why is she hiding

130
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,151
her location?

131
00:08:39,192 --> 00:08:41,356
I'd rather not
talk about it here

132
00:08:41,431 --> 00:08:44,370
but trust me,
she's no threat to anyone.

133
00:08:44,438 --> 00:08:46,499
Let me talk to her alone
and see what's going on.

134
00:08:57,666 --> 00:09:00,536
I'm alone, and no one here
will trace your signal.

135
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:03,340
You heard about Latha?

136
00:09:03,445 --> 00:09:05,780
They killed him.

137
00:09:06,954 --> 00:09:09,448
As he knelt in prayer,
they killed him.

138
00:09:09,493 --> 00:09:10,928
I know

139
00:09:10,962 --> 00:09:12,021
and the authorities

140
00:09:12,065 --> 00:09:13,967
are investigating that
right now.

141
00:09:14,002 --> 00:09:16,235
They're going
to kill me, too, Nerys.

142
00:09:16,274 --> 00:09:17,903
They've been watching me.

143
00:09:17,944 --> 00:09:19,139
Who's been watching you?

144
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,170
I don't know.

145
00:09:20,215 --> 00:09:21,308
But I feel it.

146
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,878
I need to get out of here.

147
00:09:22,922 --> 00:09:23,981
Go somewhere safe.

148
00:09:24,024 --> 00:09:26,188
Please, Nerys,
you've got to help me.

149
00:09:26,229 --> 00:09:27,926
You always promised you'd help.

150
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:29,093
All right, calm down.

151
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,399
I'll protect you.

152
00:09:30,472 --> 00:09:34,003
You can stay here at the station
until all of this is over.

153
00:09:34,046 --> 00:09:35,709
Okay.

154
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,117
Two of our officers
are returning

155
00:09:37,153 --> 00:09:38,554
this afternoon from Starbase 63.

156
00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:41,892
I'll reroute them to Bajor
and have them pick you up, okay?

157
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,729
Okay.

158
00:09:43,768 --> 00:09:45,431
Their names are Worf
and Jadzia Dax.

159
00:09:45,505 --> 00:09:47,031
They'll contact you
within the hour.

160
00:09:47,075 --> 00:09:49,068
I knew I could count on you.

161
00:09:49,112 --> 00:09:50,979
I'll see you soon.

162
00:10:00,605 --> 00:10:02,974
You've been smirking ever since
we left the starbase.

163
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,673
I do not smirk.

164
00:10:04,714 --> 00:10:08,051
But if I did, this would
be a good opportunity.

165
00:10:08,088 --> 00:10:10,491
How was I supposed to know
that Captain Ramirez

166
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,496
was a three-time <i>tongo</i> champion?

167
00:10:12,531 --> 00:10:13,830
You might have asked

168
00:10:13,867 --> 00:10:16,100
before mocking him
and then allowing him

169
00:10:16,138 --> 00:10:18,165
to up the stakes
to a no-limit game.

170
00:10:19,345 --> 00:10:20,974
I didn't lose that much.

171
00:10:21,016 --> 00:10:22,747
Two bars of latinum.

172
00:10:22,786 --> 00:10:25,053
I hope you have it.

173
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,856
I have it...

174
00:10:26,895 --> 00:10:28,022
most of it.

175
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:31,368
Worf?

176
00:10:31,406 --> 00:10:32,396
No.

177
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,977
Fine.

178
00:10:35,013 --> 00:10:36,880
I'll borrow it from Quark.

179
00:10:36,917 --> 00:10:39,218
He likes me.

180
00:10:40,593 --> 00:10:42,654
Major Kira's friend is ready
for transport.

181
00:10:42,697 --> 00:10:44,189
Quark may lend you

182
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:46,898
the money, but remember Rule
of Acquisition Number 111:

183
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:51,848
"Treat people in your debt
like family... exploit them."

184
00:10:51,883 --> 00:10:54,753
You know the Rules
of Acquisition?

185
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,726
I'm a graduate
of Starfleet Academy.

186
00:10:56,761 --> 00:10:58,594
I know many things.

187
00:10:59,801 --> 00:11:01,737
Energizing.

188
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,906
There's a power surge
in the buffer.

189
00:11:05,948 --> 00:11:08,476
Something is interfering
with the integration matrix.

190
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,253
I'm transferring her pattern
to the secondary buffer.

191
00:11:11,293 --> 00:11:13,126
Boost the gain
on the energizing coils.

192
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:15,898
It won't go any higher.

193
00:11:15,936 --> 00:11:17,337
I'm losing her.

194
00:11:56,526 --> 00:11:58,861
I'm sorry, Nerys.

195
00:11:58,898 --> 00:12:01,096
I'm hearing that a lot lately.

196
00:12:01,136 --> 00:12:02,331
Can I have a moment?

197
00:12:02,372 --> 00:12:03,773
Of course.

198
00:12:27,294 --> 00:12:31,201
I wish there was something
I could say, Major.

199
00:12:31,235 --> 00:12:33,795
Just tell me it
was an accident.

200
00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:36,230
The Constable thinks otherwise.

201
00:12:36,267 --> 00:12:39,934
I believe she was killed
by a remat detonator.

202
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:41,069
It's a device

203
00:12:41,111 --> 00:12:44,346
programmed to scramble
a transporter beam

204
00:12:44,385 --> 00:12:46,652
during rematerialization.

205
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:47,851
They're typically

206
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:50,228
no more than two cubic
millimeters in size.

207
00:12:50,265 --> 00:12:52,828
It could have been
hidden in her clothing

208
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,637
or injected into her skin.

209
00:12:55,677 --> 00:12:57,670
The device is typically used
by the Romulans.

210
00:12:57,714 --> 00:13:00,015
However, it is sold
on the black market.

211
00:13:00,053 --> 00:13:01,682
Why didn't the transporter
security system

212
00:13:01,723 --> 00:13:02,691
detect the device?

213
00:13:02,725 --> 00:13:03,715
We're not sure.

214
00:13:03,761 --> 00:13:06,996
The system is programmed
to scan for remats.

215
00:13:07,035 --> 00:13:08,766
So whoever did this

216
00:13:08,805 --> 00:13:10,399
has a sophisticated
understanding

217
00:13:10,442 --> 00:13:12,105
of our security protocols.

218
00:13:15,119 --> 00:13:18,422
And a vendetta against the
Shakaar resistance cell.

219
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,895
I thought you said

220
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,527
that Trentin Fala wasn't
a member of the Shakaar.

221
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:24,539
She wasn't...

222
00:13:25,542 --> 00:13:28,173
at least not officially.

223
00:13:29,952 --> 00:13:33,483
Fala spent the occupation
cleaning floors

224
00:13:33,526 --> 00:13:36,693
in a Cardassian records office
in Dakhur Province.

225
00:13:36,734 --> 00:13:39,262
She passed us information
for years

226
00:13:39,306 --> 00:13:41,242
without anyone catching on

227
00:13:41,276 --> 00:13:46,015
but she was always so afraid...

228
00:13:46,054 --> 00:13:48,491
afraid she'd be caught
and executed...

229
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,126
but she never stopped.

230
00:13:53,737 --> 00:13:55,366
I told her once

231
00:13:55,408 --> 00:13:58,404
that I thought she was
braver than all of us

232
00:13:58,448 --> 00:14:01,352
because she had to live
with her fear every day.

233
00:14:04,361 --> 00:14:06,832
Even after
the occupation was over

234
00:14:06,866 --> 00:14:08,095
she didn't want anyone to know

235
00:14:08,136 --> 00:14:09,537
that she was
secretly helping us.

236
00:14:09,572 --> 00:14:10,939
She was worried...

237
00:14:13,347 --> 00:14:16,548
that someone would come looking
for her for revenge.

238
00:14:16,588 --> 00:14:19,857
Looks like her fears
were well founded.

239
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,879
That's two.

240
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:35,057
That's two.
That's two.

241
00:14:37,266 --> 00:14:42,141
That's two.
That's two.

242
00:14:44,482 --> 00:14:45,781
Hello, Major.

243
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:48,256
I was just about to call you.

244
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:49,316
Quark, what is that?

245
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,456
I just found this padd

246
00:14:51,498 --> 00:14:54,494
in a shipment of Saurian brandy
I just received.

247
00:14:54,538 --> 00:14:56,440
It was coded for you

248
00:14:56,475 --> 00:14:59,971
but somehow,
I accidentally activated it.

249
00:15:00,017 --> 00:15:01,884
Give that to me.

250
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:07,462
That's two.
That's two.

251
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,627
That's two.

252
00:15:08,669 --> 00:15:09,637
That's...

253
00:15:09,671 --> 00:15:11,573
Since she was an informant

254
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:14,172
it stands to reason
that Fala was killed

255
00:15:14,215 --> 00:15:17,950
because she was providing
information to the resistance...

256
00:15:17,989 --> 00:15:20,586
information that the Shakaar
used to plan an attack

257
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,361
on a Cardassian target.

258
00:15:23,401 --> 00:15:27,672
The killer is probably someone
who was either injured or who

259
00:15:27,711 --> 00:15:30,478
lost a family member
or a friend in that attack.

260
00:15:30,516 --> 00:15:33,853
We planned dozens of attacks
based on Fala's information.

261
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,484
It could be any of them.

262
00:15:35,527 --> 00:15:37,326
Not "any."

263
00:15:37,365 --> 00:15:39,164
We're dealing with an operation

264
00:15:39,203 --> 00:15:41,367
in which you played
a prominent part.

265
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:43,878
Now, perhaps
you could make a list

266
00:15:43,912 --> 00:15:45,848
of all the attacks
by the Shakaar

267
00:15:45,884 --> 00:15:47,444
in which you participated.

268
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,787
It's a long list.

269
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:55,429
Someone is accessing
the security database.

270
00:15:55,471 --> 00:15:56,963
Can you trace it?

271
00:15:57,008 --> 00:15:59,035
No.

272
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,743
That's three.

273
00:16:00,784 --> 00:16:01,877
Mobara.

274
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:03,946
He was in the Shakaar.

275
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,425
Where does Mobara live?

276
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,433
Um, Musilla province,
at the University...

277
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,696
Engineering School.

278
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:12,537
I'm sending an emergency message
to the authorities in Musilla.

279
00:16:12,576 --> 00:16:13,669
Maybe it's not too late.

280
00:16:17,152 --> 00:16:18,485
Are you all right?

281
00:16:18,522 --> 00:16:19,957
No, I'm not all right!

282
00:16:19,992 --> 00:16:22,520
I haven't slept in three days,
someone is killing my friends

283
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:23,658
and my back...

284
00:16:32,687 --> 00:16:34,020
Sorry.

285
00:16:34,056 --> 00:16:36,823
No apology necessary, Major.

286
00:16:39,535 --> 00:16:41,562
They haven't been able
to contact Mobara

287
00:16:41,606 --> 00:16:43,132
so they're sending
a search party

288
00:16:43,176 --> 00:16:45,203
to the University right now.

289
00:16:45,248 --> 00:16:46,717
They'll let us know
what happens.

290
00:16:46,751 --> 00:16:48,448
Major

291
00:16:48,488 --> 00:16:50,287
if I may make a suggestion...

292
00:16:50,325 --> 00:16:52,626
why don't you return
to your quarters

293
00:16:52,664 --> 00:16:54,031
and rest for now?

294
00:16:54,066 --> 00:16:55,467
It may be several hours

295
00:16:55,503 --> 00:16:58,442
before they're able
to make a complete search.

296
00:16:58,477 --> 00:17:01,005
Maybe you're right.

297
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:08,125
But let me know
the moment you hear something.

298
00:17:08,164 --> 00:17:09,531
You have my word.

299
00:17:45,012 --> 00:17:46,641
I'm going to lie down.

300
00:17:46,682 --> 00:17:49,518
Help yourself to the replicator
if you're hungry.

301
00:17:49,556 --> 00:17:50,889
Thank you, Major.

302
00:19:07,928 --> 00:19:08,896
Don't move!

303
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:09,659
Hold it.

304
00:19:09,698 --> 00:19:10,859
Furel?

305
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,733
Nerys?

306
00:19:14,743 --> 00:19:17,910
Oh! You're lucky
I didn't shoot you.

307
00:19:17,983 --> 00:19:19,577
Well, I could say
the same about you.

308
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,112
What are you doing
creeping around

309
00:19:21,157 --> 00:19:22,456
in a dark room with a phaser?

310
00:19:22,493 --> 00:19:23,654
I live here.

311
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:24,891
What about him?

312
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:27,164
Oh... This is
Lieutenant Brilgar.

313
00:19:27,203 --> 00:19:29,123
He's station security
here to protect me.

314
00:19:29,256 --> 00:19:30,417
Oh. Sorry.

315
00:19:30,459 --> 00:19:33,363
You know these people, Major?

316
00:19:33,399 --> 00:19:35,563
I'm afraid so.
This is Furel, Lupaza.

317
00:19:35,604 --> 00:19:37,905
We were in the same
resistance cell.

318
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:40,574
Brilgar, sorry about the...

319
00:19:40,615 --> 00:19:41,914
Yeah, yeah.

320
00:19:41,952 --> 00:19:43,615
I'll be outside if you need me.

321
00:19:43,655 --> 00:19:46,126
Thank you.

322
00:19:46,161 --> 00:19:47,596
How did you get in?

323
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,361
We just installed
a new security system.

324
00:19:49,401 --> 00:19:51,132
And a pretty good one
it is, too.

325
00:19:51,172 --> 00:19:53,405
But they have not yet
invented the system

326
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:54,776
that Lupaza cannot beat.

327
00:19:56,116 --> 00:19:57,277
It took some work

328
00:19:57,318 --> 00:19:59,653
but I managed to retune
the transporter scrambler.

329
00:19:59,724 --> 00:20:01,785
You beamed in?
From where?

330
00:20:01,828 --> 00:20:03,821
We stowed away
aboard a transport ship

331
00:20:03,866 --> 00:20:06,030
making a run from Bajor.

332
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:07,370
Just before it docked

333
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:09,935
I accessed the station
personnel records.

334
00:20:09,979 --> 00:20:12,246
We beamed into the bedroom
about five minutes ago.

335
00:20:12,285 --> 00:20:14,346
We heard
somebody moving around in here.

336
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,517
I thought it was you.

337
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:17,323
But it turned out to be
a man with a phaser...

338
00:20:17,362 --> 00:20:18,854
And I tried to tell her

339
00:20:18,899 --> 00:20:20,835
that we should contact you
before we came...

340
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,169
You did not.

341
00:20:22,206 --> 00:20:23,800
I should have you both
thrown in the brig...

342
00:20:25,914 --> 00:20:28,010
but I'm glad to see you.

343
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,023
It's good to see you.

344
00:20:33,064 --> 00:20:34,693
Go get it.

345
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,169
What? Oh...

346
00:20:38,776 --> 00:20:40,473
Can I?

347
00:20:40,513 --> 00:20:41,606
Oh.

348
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:46,088
How much longer?

349
00:20:46,126 --> 00:20:47,253
A couple of weeks.

350
00:20:47,295 --> 00:20:48,594
Been sneezing?

351
00:20:48,631 --> 00:20:49,599
Off and on.

352
00:20:49,633 --> 00:20:50,932
The doctor's
giving me something.

353
00:20:50,969 --> 00:20:53,030
But before we get
too deep into baby talk

354
00:20:53,074 --> 00:20:55,477
I had another message today.

355
00:20:55,513 --> 00:20:56,982
This time, it's Mobara.

356
00:20:57,016 --> 00:20:58,713
- Dead?
- We don't know yet.

357
00:20:58,754 --> 00:21:01,282
There's a search party out
right now looking for him.

358
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:02,316
Do you have any suspects?

359
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:03,921
- No.
- Well, when you do

360
00:21:03,965 --> 00:21:05,730
- you let us know.
- That's why we're here...

361
00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:07,830
to find out who's doing this...

362
00:21:07,874 --> 00:21:09,275
and take care of it.

363
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:13,611
I can't send you out
like some assassination squad.

364
00:21:13,653 --> 00:21:16,318
You don't have
to send us anywhere.

365
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:17,919
You just give us the name.

366
00:21:17,962 --> 00:21:19,761
We'll take care of the rest.

367
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,497
The occupation is over.

368
00:21:21,537 --> 00:21:23,770
We can't go around
fighting private wars.

369
00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:24,777
Times have changed.

370
00:21:24,811 --> 00:21:25,938
We have got to change with it.

371
00:21:25,979 --> 00:21:27,208
Leave this for the authorities.

372
00:21:27,249 --> 00:21:28,217
Authorities?!

373
00:21:28,251 --> 00:21:29,219
Maybe you feel that way now

374
00:21:29,253 --> 00:21:30,517
but trust me

375
00:21:30,557 --> 00:21:34,999
when you find out
who killed Latha and Fala

376
00:21:35,033 --> 00:21:36,798
and maybe now Mobara

377
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:39,307
you're not going to want
to leave it to someone else.

378
00:21:39,342 --> 00:21:40,641
You're going to want him dead

379
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:43,242
and you're going
to want us to do it.

380
00:21:46,225 --> 00:21:47,922
Maybe so

381
00:21:47,962 --> 00:21:50,399
but we're not at that point yet.

382
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,163
Hmm.

383
00:21:53,607 --> 00:21:55,076
What's in the box?

384
00:21:56,413 --> 00:21:57,746
It's for you.

385
00:21:57,782 --> 00:21:59,081
For me?

386
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:01,352
A gift.

387
00:22:02,426 --> 00:22:03,952
<i>Makara</i> herbs.

388
00:22:03,997 --> 00:22:05,192
You're...

389
00:22:05,232 --> 00:22:07,703
You're supposed to take them
during your pregnancy.

390
00:22:07,738 --> 00:22:09,230
She knows what they're for.

391
00:22:10,611 --> 00:22:12,274
We thought
you might have trouble

392
00:22:12,315 --> 00:22:14,308
getting fresh herbs
on the station

393
00:22:14,352 --> 00:22:16,117
so we picked them last night.

394
00:22:17,126 --> 00:22:19,096
Thanks.

395
00:22:22,037 --> 00:22:24,600
Really... thank you.

396
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:29,515
Well, if you're staying,
I better find you some quarters.

397
00:22:29,553 --> 00:22:30,954
We're staying right here

398
00:22:30,989 --> 00:22:33,016
where we can keep
an eye on you...

399
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:34,690
on both of you.

400
00:22:34,731 --> 00:22:36,030
Yeah, we'll sleep out here.

401
00:22:36,067 --> 00:22:37,536
The couch is a little short

402
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:40,634
but it's probably
as comfortable as our bed.

403
00:22:40,677 --> 00:22:44,242
Well, since Keiko's visiting
her parents with Molly

404
00:22:44,285 --> 00:22:45,777
I guess there's room.

405
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,316
Hold it!

406
00:22:48,361 --> 00:22:49,386
It's all right!

407
00:22:57,681 --> 00:22:59,014
Miles...

408
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,887
we have houseguests.

409
00:23:10,142 --> 00:23:13,377
They found his body
about two hours ago...

410
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:15,819
or at least what was left of it.

411
00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:18,690
Mobara had
a micro-explosive implanted

412
00:23:18,727 --> 00:23:20,697
just behind his right ear.

413
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,828
How could someone
get close enough

414
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:25,340
to implant something
behind someone's ear

415
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:26,674
and not get caught?

416
00:23:26,712 --> 00:23:28,739
I doubt he was ever near Mobara.

417
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:32,747
The killer's shown a pattern
of using remote control devices.

418
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:35,821
He was probably using some sort
of hunter probe

419
00:23:35,865 --> 00:23:37,926
and injected Mobara as he slept.

420
00:23:38,003 --> 00:23:40,497
What are we dealing with here...
a professional assassin?

421
00:23:40,542 --> 00:23:42,672
Well, that was
my initial thought

422
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:43,942
but a professional

423
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:46,521
would never be sending
anonymous messages.

424
00:23:46,555 --> 00:23:48,115
No, our killer is someone

425
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,357
with a very personal
stake in this...

426
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:51,763
someone who is trying

427
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,565
to make a point to Major Kira.

428
00:23:53,604 --> 00:23:55,973
And once he drives
his point home?

429
00:23:56,076 --> 00:23:58,172
He'll try to kill her, too.

430
00:24:00,486 --> 00:24:01,613
That's one.

431
00:24:01,655 --> 00:24:03,625
That's two.

432
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:05,892
That's three.

433
00:24:05,931 --> 00:24:07,264
It doesn't sound natural.

434
00:24:07,301 --> 00:24:09,100
No kidding.

435
00:24:09,138 --> 00:24:10,437
I mean, I know they're using

436
00:24:10,474 --> 00:24:12,535
some kind of scrambler
to disguise the voice

437
00:24:12,579 --> 00:24:14,105
but there's something else.

438
00:24:14,149 --> 00:24:15,743
The rhythms don't
sound natural.

439
00:24:15,786 --> 00:24:17,153
More like a composite of words

440
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,523
from different speeches
put together.

441
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,256
You can tell that
through all the distortion?

442
00:24:20,296 --> 00:24:21,525
It's the lobes.

443
00:24:21,566 --> 00:24:24,197
The intonation and phrasing
are slightly off.

444
00:24:24,238 --> 00:24:25,365
I've made it a policy

445
00:24:25,407 --> 00:24:27,343
never to argue
with someone's lobes.

446
00:24:27,378 --> 00:24:28,437
All right

447
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,915
let's say these are
composite messages.

448
00:24:29,951 --> 00:24:30,976
Does that help us?

449
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,784
Maybe.

450
00:24:32,823 --> 00:24:33,916
Since the first word

451
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,224
of all three messages
is the same

452
00:24:35,262 --> 00:24:38,963
let's assume it's simply
been copied three times.

453
00:24:39,004 --> 00:24:40,165
That gives me a reference

454
00:24:40,206 --> 00:24:42,734
to begin screening out
the electronic interference.

455
00:24:42,778 --> 00:24:46,479
That's... that's... that's...

456
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,955
that's...

457
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,015
It's a female.

458
00:24:49,126 --> 00:24:50,720
That's...

459
00:24:50,763 --> 00:24:52,164
And it's not Cardassian.

460
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:52,996
You're sure?

461
00:24:53,769 --> 00:24:55,329
Uh, all right.

462
00:24:55,373 --> 00:24:56,672
All right.

463
00:24:56,709 --> 00:24:58,542
...that's... that's...

464
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,516
It's... Bajoran.

465
00:25:00,551 --> 00:25:02,612
I know that voice.

466
00:25:02,656 --> 00:25:06,289
Can I hear the rest
of the words?

467
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,300
That's one.

468
00:25:08,335 --> 00:25:09,998
That's two.

469
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:11,702
That's three...
It's me.

470
00:25:11,742 --> 00:25:13,371
That's one...

471
00:25:13,413 --> 00:25:15,349
He's using my voice.

472
00:25:16,954 --> 00:25:19,687
There's been an explosion
in the Habitat Ring.

473
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,457
Location.

474
00:25:21,497 --> 00:25:23,695
Level 5, Section 21-Alpha.

475
00:25:23,735 --> 00:25:25,899
The O'Brien's quarters.

476
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,169
Go to Red Alert.

477
00:25:27,209 --> 00:25:28,438
Stop all incoming
and outgoing ships

478
00:25:28,479 --> 00:25:29,447
until further notice.

479
00:25:29,481 --> 00:25:30,449
Aye, sir.

480
00:25:30,483 --> 00:25:31,508
Dax to Infirmary.

481
00:25:31,553 --> 00:25:34,286
Dr. Bashir report
to Habitat Ring Level 5

482
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:37,058
Section 21-Alpha...
medical emergency.

483
00:25:37,164 --> 00:25:38,359
Report.

484
00:25:38,401 --> 00:25:40,565
There's been an explosion
in O'Brien's quarters.

485
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:41,665
There's a hull breach.

486
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:43,575
The compartment is
venting air into space.

487
00:25:43,612 --> 00:25:44,580
Casualties?

488
00:25:44,614 --> 00:25:46,049
No word yet.

489
00:25:46,084 --> 00:25:48,077
I'm having trouble
scanning through the debris.

490
00:25:48,123 --> 00:25:49,113
Where's Kira?

491
00:25:51,129 --> 00:25:52,222
Major, you can't go in.

492
00:25:52,264 --> 00:25:53,232
There's a hull breach...

493
00:25:53,267 --> 00:25:54,257
Get out of my way!

494
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:58,743
Major, please...

495
00:26:04,091 --> 00:26:05,059
Major, no.

496
00:26:05,093 --> 00:26:06,824
You'll vent the whole corridor.

497
00:26:31,217 --> 00:26:32,948
Nerys?

498
00:26:32,987 --> 00:26:36,051
Nerys, can you hear me?

499
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,114
Julian...

500
00:26:38,248 --> 00:26:39,842
You're in the Infirmary.

501
00:26:39,885 --> 00:26:41,320
The baby?

502
00:26:41,354 --> 00:26:44,019
He's fine.

503
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:46,828
You suffered
a placental laceration

504
00:26:46,867 --> 00:26:49,304
and then you began
to hemorrhage

505
00:26:49,339 --> 00:26:51,503
but I've repaired the damage.

506
00:26:51,544 --> 00:26:53,309
You're going to be all right.

507
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:00,622
Lupaza and Furel...

508
00:27:00,663 --> 00:27:03,066
they're dead, aren't they?

509
00:27:03,102 --> 00:27:05,072
I'm afraid so.

510
00:27:07,412 --> 00:27:09,143
Miles?

511
00:27:09,183 --> 00:27:11,313
He wasn't there
when it happened.

512
00:27:14,026 --> 00:27:15,461
Did they die quickly?

513
00:27:15,496 --> 00:27:17,831
Instantly.

514
00:27:19,739 --> 00:27:21,436
Doctor, may I?

515
00:27:21,476 --> 00:27:23,446
I'll be right outside.

516
00:27:27,857 --> 00:27:31,058
I was 13 when I joined
the resistance.

517
00:27:31,097 --> 00:27:34,195
I'd been hanging around
the Shakaar base camp

518
00:27:34,238 --> 00:27:36,835
for a couple of weeks...
you know, running errands

519
00:27:36,877 --> 00:27:39,041
cleaning weapons,
that kind of thing.

520
00:27:39,082 --> 00:27:42,853
Then one night, they
had an ambush planned

521
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:46,352
and they were a man short,
so I volunteered

522
00:27:46,397 --> 00:27:50,999
but everyone thought
I was too young, too small.

523
00:27:53,012 --> 00:27:56,885
Lupaza stuck up for me.

524
00:27:56,921 --> 00:28:01,022
She said I had
the heart of sinoraptor

525
00:28:01,063 --> 00:28:05,402
and they didn't have
much choice.

526
00:28:05,439 --> 00:28:07,466
Furel made some kind of joke.

527
00:28:07,511 --> 00:28:09,481
I don't remember what it was

528
00:28:09,515 --> 00:28:12,316
but I do remember
that Lupaza hit him.

529
00:28:12,354 --> 00:28:14,587
She was always doing that.

530
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:17,793
They loved each other
in some way.

531
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:21,672
But it was up to Shakaar

532
00:28:21,709 --> 00:28:25,410
and he stared at me
for a long time

533
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:29,049
before he decided
I was big enough

534
00:28:29,091 --> 00:28:32,121
to carry a phaser rifle
after all.

535
00:28:32,165 --> 00:28:37,610
So we set the ambush up
along a ridgeline that night

536
00:28:37,644 --> 00:28:39,705
and waited.

537
00:28:39,748 --> 00:28:41,411
I was so cold.

538
00:28:41,452 --> 00:28:43,081
My hands were shaking.

539
00:28:43,122 --> 00:28:46,118
I was so afraid that one of them
would look at me

540
00:28:46,162 --> 00:28:47,756
and think that I was nervous

541
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:51,000
that I kept biting my fingers
to keep the blood flowing.

542
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:55,175
We must have waited there
three or four hours

543
00:28:55,216 --> 00:28:56,617
before the skimmer appeared.

544
00:28:56,651 --> 00:29:00,056
It set down
right where Furel said it would.

545
00:29:00,093 --> 00:29:03,624
And when that hatch opened

546
00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:05,968
and that first Cardassian
appeared

547
00:29:06,006 --> 00:29:07,498
I just started firing

548
00:29:07,543 --> 00:29:08,944
and I didn't stop

549
00:29:08,979 --> 00:29:12,441
till I'd discharged
the entire power cell.

550
00:29:14,458 --> 00:29:16,759
When it was all over, I...

551
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,495
I was so relieved
that I hadn't let anyone down

552
00:29:19,536 --> 00:29:21,632
I, I was giddy.

553
00:29:21,673 --> 00:29:25,774
Furel told me to stop grinning,
that it made me look younger

554
00:29:25,849 --> 00:29:27,512
but I couldn't help it.

555
00:29:29,491 --> 00:29:30,858
I was one of them.

556
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,903
I was in the resistance.

557
00:29:40,181 --> 00:29:43,154
Lupaza made me this...

558
00:29:43,187 --> 00:29:46,388
out of some of the metal
from that skimmer.

559
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,200
How were they killed?

560
00:29:54,245 --> 00:29:57,548
Someone attached
a small hunter probe

561
00:29:57,586 --> 00:30:00,422
to the hull
of a Talavian freighter.

562
00:30:00,459 --> 00:30:03,363
When the ship docked
at the station

563
00:30:03,398 --> 00:30:05,995
the probe detached itself
and then began a visual scan

564
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:08,703
of every room
in the Habitat Ring.

565
00:30:08,744 --> 00:30:11,181
Once the probe found
its assigned targets

566
00:30:11,216 --> 00:30:15,385
it attached itself to the window
and exploded.

567
00:30:24,445 --> 00:30:26,108
Do you have any leads?

568
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:28,920
My sources on Cardassia

569
00:30:28,954 --> 00:30:31,653
have given me a list
of possible suspects.

570
00:30:31,694 --> 00:30:34,325
They all have
the computer skills

571
00:30:34,367 --> 00:30:39,140
the opportunity, and the motive,
to carry out these attacks.

572
00:30:39,177 --> 00:30:41,375
You must have called in
a lot of favors.

573
00:30:41,415 --> 00:30:43,385
One or two.

574
00:30:43,419 --> 00:30:45,412
How many people
are on the list now?

575
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:47,257
Twenty-five.

576
00:30:47,295 --> 00:30:48,320
Can I see it?

577
00:30:48,363 --> 00:30:50,960
Not... just yet.

578
00:30:51,003 --> 00:30:54,808
I'd like to...
narrow it a little.

579
00:30:54,845 --> 00:30:58,148
You're afraid I'm going
to take the names

580
00:30:58,185 --> 00:31:00,748
and go charging off after them.

581
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:03,695
Something like that.

582
00:31:04,967 --> 00:31:06,800
You're right.

583
00:31:08,307 --> 00:31:10,174
I probably would.

584
00:31:10,212 --> 00:31:13,947
I'm going to find
the person that's done this.

585
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,548
I promise you that.

586
00:31:16,592 --> 00:31:18,995
I know you will, Odo.

587
00:31:21,002 --> 00:31:22,733
Keep me informed.

588
00:31:22,773 --> 00:31:25,006
Absolutely.

589
00:31:47,393 --> 00:31:49,694
Emergency transport standing by.

590
00:31:49,732 --> 00:31:51,725
Enter command code
authorization.

591
00:31:51,769 --> 00:31:54,970
Authorization: Kira-
one-five-seven-alpha.

592
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:57,243
Initiating transport.

593
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:31,446
Computer, initiate emergency
transport program Kira-2.

594
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,357
Initiating transport.

595
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:53,496
Computer, locate Major Kira.

596
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:56,237
Major Kira is
no longer on the station.

597
00:33:15,153 --> 00:33:17,488
She's obviously going after
the suspects on the list

598
00:33:17,525 --> 00:33:19,427
but she erased their names
from my computer file

599
00:33:19,462 --> 00:33:20,691
when she got them

600
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,497
so there's no way
to know where she's headed.

601
00:33:22,536 --> 00:33:23,731
Prepare the <i>Defiant.</i>

602
00:33:23,772 --> 00:33:24,933
I want to leave in ten minutes

603
00:33:24,974 --> 00:33:26,466
see if we can pick up
her ion trial.

604
00:33:26,511 --> 00:33:27,740
It will be difficult.

605
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,249
Our sensor logs show Major Kira

606
00:33:29,284 --> 00:33:31,653
masked her engine emissions
with a polaron field.

607
00:33:31,689 --> 00:33:32,850
The runabout's particle...

608
00:33:32,892 --> 00:33:34,259
I know
what the difficulties are.

609
00:33:34,295 --> 00:33:35,764
You have your orders.
Dismissed.

610
00:33:35,798 --> 00:33:37,267
Aye, sir.

611
00:33:40,575 --> 00:33:45,746
Kira Nerys, Personal Log,
Stardate 50416.2.

612
00:33:45,786 --> 00:33:48,918
I've eliminated three of
the suspects from Odo's list.

613
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,725
I'm satisfied that none of them

614
00:33:50,764 --> 00:33:52,393
could have committed
the murders.

615
00:33:52,434 --> 00:33:54,461
The fourth name is Silaran Prin

616
00:33:54,505 --> 00:33:57,603
a Cardassian living
on a planet near the DMZ.

617
00:35:15,517 --> 00:35:18,547
A creature, born within the
comforting anonymity of darkness

618
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:21,061
awakens in the harsh truth
of daylight.

619
00:35:21,096 --> 00:35:23,294
It squirms in the glare

620
00:35:23,334 --> 00:35:26,273
afraid of the light
that pins it to the chair

621
00:35:26,308 --> 00:35:28,939
like a needle through its heart.

622
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,007
Its heart beats faster...

623
00:35:31,051 --> 00:35:32,280
Who's there?

624
00:35:32,321 --> 00:35:35,088
Silaran, is that you?

625
00:35:35,127 --> 00:35:36,926
Panic starts
to creep into its soul.

626
00:35:36,964 --> 00:35:38,193
Does it understand?

627
00:35:38,234 --> 00:35:41,035
Or is it so blinded
by the light

628
00:35:41,073 --> 00:35:44,103
that it can think only
of returning

629
00:35:44,147 --> 00:35:46,983
to the velvet cloak of darkness?

630
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,352
No matter.

631
00:35:48,389 --> 00:35:51,156
Perhaps it is better
that it doesn't realize

632
00:35:51,195 --> 00:35:52,926
how close death has come.

633
00:35:52,965 --> 00:35:56,166
But make no mistake,
there is no escape.

634
00:35:56,206 --> 00:36:00,876
It has reached the end
and soon it will die.

635
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,964
What's the matter, Silaran?

636
00:36:10,003 --> 00:36:11,563
Are you so afraid
of a pregnant woman

637
00:36:11,607 --> 00:36:13,840
in a restraining field
you have to hide in the dark?

638
00:36:13,879 --> 00:36:16,818
It bears its tiny fangs,
hoping for a chance to strike...

639
00:36:16,852 --> 00:36:20,121
to sink its deep teeth deep
into the flesh of its tormentor

640
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:22,061
but that chance will never come.

641
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:24,226
You better hope
I don't get that chance.

642
00:36:24,268 --> 00:36:25,497
And somewhere
beneath the gleam

643
00:36:25,538 --> 00:36:27,531
of hatred in those eyes

644
00:36:27,575 --> 00:36:31,174
lurks the certain knowledge
of its impending death

645
00:36:31,216 --> 00:36:34,348
and it begins to know fear.

646
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:36,417
I'm not afraid of you.

647
00:36:36,462 --> 00:36:37,931
I'm not some coward

648
00:36:37,964 --> 00:36:39,957
who's been sending anonymous
messages and bombs

649
00:36:40,003 --> 00:36:41,870
to murder innocent people.

650
00:36:41,907 --> 00:36:44,037
No, Kira, I didn't
murder anyone!

651
00:36:44,078 --> 00:36:45,046
You did.

652
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,381
You killed them all.

653
00:36:47,419 --> 00:36:49,754
There.

654
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:51,921
That wasn't so hard, was it?

655
00:36:51,962 --> 00:36:53,955
Now we can talk.

656
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,061
Talk and lies won't help you.

657
00:36:56,104 --> 00:36:57,368
You're in the light

658
00:36:57,408 --> 00:37:00,005
and the light reveals the truth.

659
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:08,727
And the light shows me no regret
in those eyes, no compassion.

660
00:37:08,765 --> 00:37:12,398
You want me to...
feel compassion for you?

661
00:37:12,441 --> 00:37:16,006
You murdered five people.

662
00:37:16,048 --> 00:37:17,915
What compassion
did you show to them?

663
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,216
Unrepentant.

664
00:37:19,255 --> 00:37:20,223
How unfortunate.

665
00:37:20,257 --> 00:37:22,124
I thought you might
have changed...

666
00:37:22,161 --> 00:37:25,966
might have found a path
out of the darkness.

667
00:37:26,004 --> 00:37:27,997
What am I supposed
to feel repentant for?

668
00:37:28,041 --> 00:37:29,408
What are you talking about?

669
00:37:29,444 --> 00:37:31,471
That is part of your guilt.

670
00:37:31,516 --> 00:37:33,817
You did this to me...

671
00:37:33,887 --> 00:37:38,853
and you don't even know
who... I... am.

672
00:37:40,368 --> 00:37:43,204
So you were wounded
during an attack I carried out

673
00:37:43,242 --> 00:37:45,109
when I was part
of the resistance

674
00:37:45,146 --> 00:37:47,447
and I'm supposed to feel guilty?

675
00:37:47,484 --> 00:37:50,115
We were at war, Silaran.

676
00:37:50,157 --> 00:37:54,292
15 million Bajorans died
during the occupation

677
00:37:54,332 --> 00:37:56,826
and you want me
to feel sorry for you?

678
00:37:56,871 --> 00:37:57,998
No, I wasn't part of your war.

679
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,703
I was an innocent.

680
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:01,646
I wasn't even in the military.

681
00:38:01,682 --> 00:38:03,652
Do you know what I did on Bajor?

682
00:38:03,686 --> 00:38:05,315
I was a servant.

683
00:38:05,356 --> 00:38:10,995
I cleaned uniforms
for Gul Pirak.

684
00:38:11,036 --> 00:38:13,166
Gul Pirak...

685
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:17,041
Commander of the weapons depot
at Hathon.

686
00:38:17,082 --> 00:38:19,713
I'm glad that you remember.

687
00:38:19,754 --> 00:38:23,353
Now, do you remember...

688
00:38:23,396 --> 00:38:24,865
what you did?

689
00:38:24,933 --> 00:38:27,598
How you put a plasma charge

690
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:31,101
outside his bedroom window
in the middle of the night?

691
00:38:31,147 --> 00:38:33,014
I remember.

692
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,883
He executed

693
00:38:34,989 --> 00:38:38,429
15 Bajoran farmers because
they refused to display

694
00:38:38,463 --> 00:38:41,367
the Cardassian banner
outside their homes.

695
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,597
Trentin Fala showed you

696
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:44,575
how to circumvent
the defense system.

697
00:38:44,609 --> 00:38:47,673
Latha Mabrin built
the plasma charge.

698
00:38:47,716 --> 00:38:50,620
Furel and Lupaza
stood guard outside

699
00:38:50,656 --> 00:38:52,923
while you crept up to the house.

700
00:38:53,028 --> 00:38:55,226
None of us liked killing.

701
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:57,931
We were fighting
for our freedom against...

702
00:38:58,005 --> 00:38:59,702
You vaporized
the entire east wing!

703
00:38:59,742 --> 00:39:01,405
12 Cardassians were killed

704
00:39:01,446 --> 00:39:05,045
including Gul Pirak's
entire family.

705
00:39:05,088 --> 00:39:08,061
23 others were crippled.

706
00:39:08,094 --> 00:39:11,295
Don't you feel guilty?

707
00:39:11,335 --> 00:39:14,000
Don't you feel ashamed
of what you did?

708
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,204
None of you belonged on Bajor.

709
00:39:16,246 --> 00:39:18,148
It wasn't your world.

710
00:39:18,183 --> 00:39:21,486
For 50 years,
you raped our planet

711
00:39:21,523 --> 00:39:24,324
and you killed our people,
you lived on our land

712
00:39:24,364 --> 00:39:25,856
and you took the food
out of our mouths

713
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,802
and I don't care whether you
held a phaser in your hand

714
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:30,241
or you ironed shirts
for a living.

715
00:39:30,277 --> 00:39:33,216
You were all guilty, and you
were all legitimate targets!

716
00:39:33,249 --> 00:39:35,310
That's what makes you
a murderer...

717
00:39:35,354 --> 00:39:37,848
indiscriminate killing,
no sense of morality

718
00:39:37,893 --> 00:39:40,558
no thought given to
the consequences of your action.

719
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:43,400
That's what makes us different.

720
00:39:43,439 --> 00:39:44,874
I was a soldier!

721
00:39:44,908 --> 00:39:47,311
You're just a bitter old man
out for revenge.

722
00:39:47,347 --> 00:39:49,978
I am bringing the guilty
to justice...

723
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:56,432
and unlike you, I take care
to protect the innocent.

724
00:39:56,467 --> 00:39:59,838
I could have killed
every monk in that cavern

725
00:39:59,874 --> 00:40:02,107
or everyone on the runabout

726
00:40:02,146 --> 00:40:05,415
or half the population
of Deep Space 9, but I didn't.

727
00:40:05,454 --> 00:40:07,390
Only the guilty have died.

728
00:40:10,198 --> 00:40:12,031
And that is why...

729
00:40:12,135 --> 00:40:16,440
although your actions
have condemned you

730
00:40:16,478 --> 00:40:19,940
the life of your child
will be spared.

731
00:40:19,986 --> 00:40:21,649
What does that mean?

732
00:40:23,259 --> 00:40:25,058
What does that mean?!

733
00:40:25,164 --> 00:40:28,399
The creature's diseased mind
cannot understand its plight.

734
00:40:28,438 --> 00:40:31,308
Its imagination is too limited

735
00:40:31,344 --> 00:40:34,442
to perceive the truth...
it cannot be saved.

736
00:40:34,484 --> 00:40:37,251
But there is still hope
for the child.

737
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:39,522
It could be taken from the womb

738
00:40:39,655 --> 00:40:41,386
and raised in the light.

739
00:40:41,426 --> 00:40:42,519
Listen to me, Silaran.

740
00:40:42,562 --> 00:40:44,897
The child I'm carrying,
it isn't Bajoran...

741
00:40:44,933 --> 00:40:45,901
it's human.

742
00:40:45,936 --> 00:40:47,235
It has unique medical needs.

743
00:40:47,272 --> 00:40:49,402
If you force me to give
birth now, you risk...

744
00:40:49,444 --> 00:40:51,004
The creature's cries
grow louder

745
00:40:51,047 --> 00:40:52,346
but no one can hear them.

746
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:56,016
All that remains is to bring
the child into the light

747
00:40:56,058 --> 00:41:00,865
and discard the diseased
carcass of the mother

748
00:41:00,902 --> 00:41:04,775
before it can infect
its offspring.

749
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:07,646
You can't bring it
into the light... not yet!

750
00:41:07,684 --> 00:41:09,586
Dr. Bashir said
if I don't have at least

751
00:41:09,621 --> 00:41:10,816
three more weeks...

752
00:41:10,857 --> 00:41:11,847
It's time.

753
00:41:15,267 --> 00:41:19,572
We both agree
this baby is an innocent.

754
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,580
Don't put him at risk,
please, Silaran.

755
00:41:23,151 --> 00:41:25,018
Don't worry.

756
00:41:25,055 --> 00:41:28,722
I promise that I'll take care
of the child...

757
00:41:28,763 --> 00:41:34,105
and that I'll teach him
the difference between darkness

758
00:41:34,141 --> 00:41:35,200
and light.

759
00:41:37,883 --> 00:41:39,010
Wait.

760
00:41:41,892 --> 00:41:43,418
Please, I'm begging you.

761
00:41:45,667 --> 00:41:47,330
At least give me a sedative.

762
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:48,565
Show some compassion.

763
00:41:48,607 --> 00:41:49,974
Don't just cut me open.

764
00:41:56,524 --> 00:41:58,757
All right.

765
00:41:58,796 --> 00:42:01,700
I'll show more mercy
than you have.

766
00:42:08,684 --> 00:42:11,885
Take a good look
at my face, Kira!

767
00:42:11,925 --> 00:42:16,492
I want it to be
the last thing you see.

768
00:42:20,075 --> 00:42:22,376
The creature slept...

769
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:25,546
dreaming its dark dreams

770
00:42:25,588 --> 00:42:28,993
and happy to be
out of the light.

771
00:42:29,095 --> 00:42:33,697
The innocent life it held
would awaken in brilliance...

772
00:42:36,278 --> 00:42:38,248
and never...

773
00:42:38,282 --> 00:42:40,583
know darkness...

774
00:42:40,621 --> 00:42:41,885
again.

775
00:42:43,795 --> 00:42:44,660
Oh!

776
00:43:17,568 --> 00:43:18,901
Are you all right?

777
00:43:20,409 --> 00:43:21,810
She's fine

778
00:43:21,844 --> 00:43:24,042
but there's a large amount
of merfadon in her system.

779
00:43:24,116 --> 00:43:25,915
- "Merfadon"?
- It's a sedative.

780
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:29,057
But the <i>makara</i> herbs
she's been taking

781
00:43:29,127 --> 00:43:30,653
have counteracted the effect.

782
00:43:30,698 --> 00:43:32,395
I take it this is our assassin.

783
00:43:32,435 --> 00:43:34,998
Why did he give you a sedative?

784
00:43:36,277 --> 00:43:38,748
He wanted
to protect the innocent...

785
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:43,615
and separate the darkness
from the light...

786
00:43:45,797 --> 00:43:47,630
but he didn't realize...

787
00:43:49,806 --> 00:43:53,109
the light only shines
in the dark

788
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:56,985
and sometimes innocence is
just an excuse for the guilty.

789
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:11,683
Let's go home.

790
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:14,921
Sisko to <i>Defiant.</i>

791
00:44:14,961 --> 00:44:15,986
Go ahead.

792
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:18,331
Four to beam up.

793
00:44:18,369 --> 00:44:20,202
Energize.
