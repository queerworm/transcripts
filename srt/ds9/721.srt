1
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:08,837
Basically, we stumbled on it
by accident.

2
00:00:08,881 --> 00:00:12,151
At Chin'toka,
our entire fleet was disabled

3
00:00:12,189 --> 00:00:16,188
when the Breen engaged
their energy-dampening weapon.

4
00:00:16,267 --> 00:00:21,144
311 ships... Federation, Romulan
and Klingon... all lost power.

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,713
But one didn't... a bird-of-prey
called the <i>Ki'tang.</i>

6
00:00:24,756 --> 00:00:25,725
Why?

7
00:00:25,758 --> 00:00:26,988
What was different
about the <i>Ki'tang?</i>

8
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:28,054
We're not really sure.

9
00:00:28,098 --> 00:00:30,866
The only thing we can figure
is that just prior

10
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:33,069
to the engagement
their Chief Engineer

11
00:00:33,111 --> 00:00:35,447
adjusted the tritium
intermix to compensate

12
00:00:35,484 --> 00:00:38,116
for a containment problem
in the warp core.

13
00:00:38,157 --> 00:00:40,219
I've ordered every ship
in the Klingon fleet

14
00:00:40,262 --> 00:00:41,892
to adjust its reactor
the same way.

15
00:00:41,934 --> 00:00:44,270
Our vessels are
of a different design.

16
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,644
Can this technique be adapted
to protect them as well?

17
00:00:47,682 --> 00:00:48,981
Unfortunately, no.

18
00:00:49,018 --> 00:00:51,080
Your ships are still vulnerable,
and so are ours.

19
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:52,651
I've sent everything we know

20
00:00:52,695 --> 00:00:54,598
about the Breen weapon
to the Romulan Ministry

21
00:00:54,633 --> 00:00:56,467
of Science
and to Starfleet Engineering

22
00:00:56,505 --> 00:00:58,635
but realistically,
it's going to take awhile

23
00:00:58,677 --> 00:01:01,742
before they can figure out a way
to protect our ships.

24
00:01:01,786 --> 00:01:03,620
Thank you, Mr. O'Brien.

25
00:01:06,297 --> 00:01:09,898
Well, gentlemen, it seems
as if the Klingon fleet

26
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:14,281
is the only thing that stands
between us and the Dominion.

27
00:01:14,318 --> 00:01:16,312
What have we come to?

28
00:01:19,331 --> 00:01:23,638
By tomorrow, we'll have
1,500 Klingon vessels

29
00:01:23,676 --> 00:01:25,647
ready for deployment.

30
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:29,087
With the Breen, the Cardassians
and the Jem'Hadar

31
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:31,093
you're still outnumbered
20 to one.

32
00:01:31,128 --> 00:01:33,258
I am aware of that, General.

33
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,741
Obviously, the Klingons can't go
head-to-head with the Dominion

34
00:01:36,776 --> 00:01:39,214
but they may be able
to keep them distracted.

35
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,845
We'll operate
in small battle groups

36
00:01:40,887 --> 00:01:42,687
going in under cloak,
engaging the enemy

37
00:01:42,725 --> 00:01:44,525
and trying to provoke them
into pursuit.

38
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,363
With any luck

39
00:01:46,468 --> 00:01:48,804
they'll be able to keep
the Dominion off-balance

40
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:51,075
and prevent them
from launching an offensive.

41
00:01:51,113 --> 00:01:52,241
For how long?

42
00:01:52,283 --> 00:01:54,049
They can't keep them
at bay forever.

43
00:01:54,087 --> 00:01:55,283
No, they can't

44
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:57,022
but, fortunately,
we're not the only ones

45
00:01:57,062 --> 00:01:58,896
the Dominion has
to contend with right now.

46
00:01:58,934 --> 00:02:00,734
Damar's resistance movement.

47
00:02:00,772 --> 00:02:02,207
What's left of them.

48
00:02:02,242 --> 00:02:05,114
Half his troops were killed
in the assault on Rondac.

49
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,053
They may have failed
to capture Rondac

50
00:02:07,088 --> 00:02:10,028
but their attack sent a message
to the Cardassian people.

51
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,464
If the rebels can show them

52
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:13,367
that they have a chance
of succeeding

53
00:02:13,404 --> 00:02:14,839
their support will grow.

54
00:02:14,874 --> 00:02:17,939
Does the rebellion
have a chance of succeeding?

55
00:02:17,983 --> 00:02:20,478
Yes, but they have
to adjust their tactics...

56
00:02:20,522 --> 00:02:24,829
concentrate on small-scale,
hit-and-run attacks, sabotaging

57
00:02:24,867 --> 00:02:26,359
key facilities.

58
00:02:26,405 --> 00:02:27,635
Damar's a by-the-book soldier.

59
00:02:27,675 --> 00:02:30,045
Does he have any experience
waging this kind of campaign?

60
00:02:30,081 --> 00:02:32,576
No, he doesn't...

61
00:02:32,621 --> 00:02:37,031
which is why we have
to send him someone who does.

62
00:02:37,066 --> 00:02:39,094
You want me
to go behind enemy lines

63
00:02:39,138 --> 00:02:42,374
and teach a bunch of Cardassians
how to be resistance fighters?

64
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:45,581
I'm aware of the irony,
but the tactics you used

65
00:02:45,622 --> 00:02:47,856
to drive the Cardassians
off Bajor

66
00:02:47,894 --> 00:02:51,358
are exactly what the situation
calls for.

67
00:02:51,403 --> 00:02:52,804
To work with Damar...

68
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,341
When he killed Ziyal,
he murdered an innocent girl

69
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,322
that I considered
a part of my family.

70
00:02:59,357 --> 00:03:01,829
You're going to have to put
your personal feelings aside.

71
00:03:01,864 --> 00:03:05,134
Now, whether you like Damar
or not is irrelevant.

72
00:03:05,172 --> 00:03:06,198
We need him.

73
00:03:06,242 --> 00:03:08,646
The Dominion knows
they have to stop his rebellion

74
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:10,447
before it spreads,
and it's up to you

75
00:03:10,552 --> 00:03:11,953
to see that they don't.

76
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,756
It's as simple as that.

77
00:03:13,795 --> 00:03:15,094
Yes, sir.

78
00:03:16,936 --> 00:03:19,704
I understand that Damar
and his men went into hiding

79
00:03:19,743 --> 00:03:21,144
after the attack on Rondac.

80
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,649
Any idea how to locate them?

81
00:03:22,684 --> 00:03:25,282
I suggest you talk
to Mr. Garak about that.

82
00:03:25,324 --> 00:03:26,350
Garak?

83
00:03:26,394 --> 00:03:28,958
He still has contacts
on Cardassia.

84
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:32,134
If I were you, I would ask him
to join your team.

85
00:03:32,176 --> 00:03:33,338
He might be useful.

86
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:37,151
Damar and Garak...

87
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:39,661
should be
an interesting mission.

88
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:43,433
It's very difficult
to keep a supply

89
00:05:43,473 --> 00:05:46,105
of synthetic organs on hand
in a battlefield situation.

90
00:05:46,147 --> 00:05:48,449
You never know how many livers
you're going to need.

91
00:05:48,486 --> 00:05:52,087
Or, uh... how many hearts.

92
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:54,032
I can imagine

93
00:05:54,068 --> 00:05:57,532
but, uh, what does that
have to do with me?

94
00:05:57,609 --> 00:05:59,239
Well, the holy grail
of organ replacement

95
00:05:59,281 --> 00:06:00,375
is to be able to find a way

96
00:06:00,417 --> 00:06:03,357
to inject the patient with
undifferentiated tissue

97
00:06:03,391 --> 00:06:05,590
so that it can become
whatever organ is needed.

98
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,656
The only problem is...

99
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,603
Doctor, get to the point.

100
00:06:08,638 --> 00:06:12,444
I need to borrow...
a cup... of goo.

101
00:06:12,482 --> 00:06:14,248
Excuse me?

102
00:06:14,286 --> 00:06:15,312
Please?

103
00:06:15,356 --> 00:06:16,689
I'll give it back.

104
00:06:16,726 --> 00:06:19,255
You see, I need to study
your morphogenic matrix

105
00:06:19,299 --> 00:06:21,099
so that I can synthesize
organic tissue

106
00:06:21,138 --> 00:06:23,302
that can change form
the way your cells do.

107
00:06:23,343 --> 00:06:25,872
To use for organ replacement.

108
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:27,249
Exactly.

109
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:28,688
Well, can't you just...

110
00:06:28,724 --> 00:06:30,958
oh... scan me, or something?

111
00:06:30,997 --> 00:06:32,557
I need a sample.

112
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,400
It's for a good cause.

113
00:06:37,613 --> 00:06:38,673
All right, Doctor.

114
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:46,334
Just a tad more.

115
00:06:52,252 --> 00:06:53,380
Thank you.

116
00:06:53,421 --> 00:06:56,121
I am going to want that back

117
00:06:56,162 --> 00:06:58,726
as soon as Kira and I
return from our mission.

118
00:06:58,768 --> 00:07:00,967
Oh. You're going with her?

119
00:07:01,008 --> 00:07:03,138
She thought I might be useful.

120
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,308
When do you leave?

121
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,381
As soon as Garak
can locate Damar.

122
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:18,620
I am very concerned.

123
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,628
It's not like Solbor
to disappear this way.

124
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:26,171
Please do whatever
it takes to find him.

125
00:07:26,206 --> 00:07:27,266
Yes, Eminence.

126
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:32,154
Well done.

127
00:07:32,188 --> 00:07:34,956
I almost believed you myself.

128
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,626
How like a Cardassian

129
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,663
to find amusement
in an old man's death.

130
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:43,683
You don't know how much I
regret having to kill him.

131
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:46,123
He was going to expose us.

132
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,831
No one can be allowed
to stand in our way.

133
00:07:53,243 --> 00:07:55,613
Remember your place, Dukat.

134
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:58,623
I thought my place
was in your bed.

135
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,863
That was before
I knew who you were.

136
00:08:03,904 --> 00:08:04,998
Adami...

137
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,675
I'm not the same man
I was during the occupation.

138
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,382
The Pah-wraiths
have changed me.

139
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,991
But they can't change
what you did.

140
00:08:13,124 --> 00:08:16,896
Do you really think I could
let myself be touched by a man

141
00:08:16,934 --> 00:08:19,999
whose hands are stained
with the blood of my people?

142
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:22,206
When we do release
the Pah-wraiths

143
00:08:22,314 --> 00:08:24,582
from the fire caves

144
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,463
your hands will be stained
as well.

145
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,967
The Pah-wraiths will spare those
whom they find worthy.

146
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:37,587
The rest are of no consequence.

147
00:08:40,194 --> 00:08:43,829
You've been
studying that for days.

148
00:08:43,871 --> 00:08:46,571
Perhaps I could help.

149
00:08:46,611 --> 00:08:51,282
The text of the <i>Kosst Amojan</i>
is for my eyes alone.

150
00:08:54,331 --> 00:08:57,829
Well, have you learned
what we have to do

151
00:08:57,873 --> 00:09:00,437
to release the Pah-wraiths?

152
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,944
Only that
it's not a simple matter.

153
00:09:03,989 --> 00:09:05,083
Leave me.

154
00:09:05,126 --> 00:09:07,724
I've had enough
of your distractions.

155
00:09:25,613 --> 00:09:27,812
When is Gowron's ship
due to arrive?

156
00:09:27,851 --> 00:09:29,081
In the morning.

157
00:09:29,121 --> 00:09:33,428
Martok seems a little nervous
about the ceremony.

158
00:09:33,466 --> 00:09:35,938
Chancellor Gowron is traveling
all the way from Kronos

159
00:09:35,972 --> 00:09:38,308
to induct him into
the Order of Kahless.

160
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:39,507
I'd be nervous, too.

161
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,541
Come in.

162
00:09:43,893 --> 00:09:45,021
Good news.

163
00:09:45,063 --> 00:09:46,362
Garak was able to contact Damar.

164
00:09:46,433 --> 00:09:48,267
He's provided us
with his location

165
00:09:48,305 --> 00:09:50,607
and has requested assistance
as soon as possible.

166
00:09:50,644 --> 00:09:52,478
So, with your permission,
I'd like to depart

167
00:09:52,516 --> 00:09:53,485
first thing tomorrow.

168
00:09:53,518 --> 00:09:54,646
By all means.

169
00:09:54,688 --> 00:09:57,183
Uh... there is one other thing.

170
00:09:57,227 --> 00:09:59,164
Yes, Mr. Garak?

171
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:01,067
Damar expressed concern
when I told him

172
00:10:01,104 --> 00:10:03,406
that Colonel Kira would
be leading this mission.

173
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,812
Well, if he wants
to defeat the Dominion

174
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,414
he's going to have to put
his personal feelings aside.

175
00:10:08,523 --> 00:10:10,825
He's certainly willing
to do that.

176
00:10:10,863 --> 00:10:14,065
He knows the value
of your skills.

177
00:10:14,105 --> 00:10:16,304
Damar is concerned
that his men

178
00:10:16,344 --> 00:10:18,976
will see your uniform
as an affront.

179
00:10:19,017 --> 00:10:21,045
We Cardassians
are a proud people.

180
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:24,188
Losing Bajor
to a ragtag band of terrorists...

181
00:10:24,231 --> 00:10:25,700
no offense...

182
00:10:26,637 --> 00:10:28,471
was a humiliation.

183
00:10:28,575 --> 00:10:31,481
Simply put,
taking on a Bajoran officer

184
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:34,955
as an advisor would
undermine his authority.

185
00:10:34,992 --> 00:10:37,464
Sorry, Colonel.

186
00:10:37,498 --> 00:10:40,130
We'll have to find someone else
to head up the mission.

187
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:42,975
No... sir.

188
00:10:43,013 --> 00:10:46,511
Colonel Kira is
the best person for the job.

189
00:10:46,622 --> 00:10:49,254
There's another way
around this problem.

190
00:10:54,108 --> 00:10:55,543
I don't know.

191
00:10:55,579 --> 00:10:57,778
Do you really think it'll make
a difference to the Cardassians

192
00:10:57,818 --> 00:11:00,416
that you've been given
a Starfleet commission?

193
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:01,722
You're still a Bajoran.

194
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,162
A Bajoran with the authority

195
00:11:03,198 --> 00:11:05,032
to speak on behalf
of the Federation.

196
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,973
You realize you're going
to have to do something

197
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:09,447
about your uniform as well.

198
00:11:09,481 --> 00:11:11,953
I was afraid
you were going to say that.

199
00:11:15,096 --> 00:11:16,122
Well?

200
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,973
It's a little drab.

201
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:21,843
This is how I appeared

202
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,372
when I worked
for the Cardassians.

203
00:11:23,418 --> 00:11:27,224
Ah, well, it should
put them at ease, anyway.

204
00:11:27,261 --> 00:11:28,925
I wonder

205
00:11:28,966 --> 00:11:33,410
if Dr. Bashir could help us
with that nose of yours?

206
00:11:33,444 --> 00:11:35,882
I'm only willing to go so far.

207
00:11:35,917 --> 00:11:37,820
Damar's men are just going
to have to get used

208
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,188
to the idea of having me around.

209
00:11:39,225 --> 00:11:42,063
Oh, they'll tolerate you
to a point.

210
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:46,544
If I were you,
I'd watch my back.

211
00:11:47,547 --> 00:11:48,777
I'll see you in the morning.

212
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,346
You see the problem.

213
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,883
Our food supplies
are running low.

214
00:12:05,928 --> 00:12:07,124
We'll have to cut
back on rations

215
00:12:07,165 --> 00:12:08,999
until we can get ahold
of some food replicators.

216
00:12:09,037 --> 00:12:11,441
When I spoke to Garak,
I told him to bring some.

217
00:12:11,475 --> 00:12:13,947
Federation food replicators?

218
00:12:13,982 --> 00:12:15,417
We are in no position
to turn down help

219
00:12:15,453 --> 00:12:16,615
no matter where it comes from.

220
00:12:16,656 --> 00:12:19,322
Taking help from the
Federation is bad enough

221
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:22,303
but having to take it from
that Bajoran terrorist...

222
00:12:22,337 --> 00:12:25,641
Kira Nerys has certain skills
she's willing to teach us...

223
00:12:25,713 --> 00:12:29,485
skills we need if we're going
to defeat the Dominion.

224
00:12:29,522 --> 00:12:31,117
I can't believe
what I'm hearing.

225
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,790
When we were stationed
on Terok Nor

226
00:12:32,832 --> 00:12:34,096
you used to spend hours

227
00:12:34,135 --> 00:12:36,163
telling me
how much you despised her.

228
00:12:37,176 --> 00:12:39,044
I did hate her.

229
00:12:39,081 --> 00:12:42,146
That's a luxury I can no longer
afford and neither can you.

230
00:12:43,225 --> 00:12:45,424
I need your support in this,
my friend.

231
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,518
General.
Mr. Worf.

232
00:13:03,878 --> 00:13:06,544
Welcome to Deep Space 9,
Chancellor.

233
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:10,825
It's been too long, Captain.

234
00:13:10,863 --> 00:13:12,891
You know Admiral Ross.

235
00:13:12,936 --> 00:13:14,839
We met at Khitomer.

236
00:13:14,874 --> 00:13:17,004
Admiral, of course.

237
00:13:18,316 --> 00:13:20,219
Martok...

238
00:13:20,254 --> 00:13:22,692
the man I came to honor.

239
00:13:25,133 --> 00:13:26,397
The son of Mogh...

240
00:13:26,437 --> 00:13:27,565
Chancellor.

241
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:31,549
They say you've made him
part of your House.

242
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,178
That's true.

243
00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:40,605
Then what is past is past.

244
00:13:40,641 --> 00:13:41,871
If Martok considers you

245
00:13:41,911 --> 00:13:44,315
his brother, that's all
I need to know.

246
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:47,654
Come... I brought a barrel
of the finest bloodwine

247
00:13:47,692 --> 00:13:49,822
and it must be drunk tonight!

248
00:13:51,268 --> 00:13:53,000
The vintage... 2309, I hope.

249
00:13:56,415 --> 00:13:58,318
I guess we're not invited.

250
00:13:59,924 --> 00:14:02,054
Anyway, I finally
tracked her down to Quark's

251
00:14:02,096 --> 00:14:03,326
and I asked her flat out

252
00:14:03,366 --> 00:14:05,496
"Ezri, why are you avoiding me?"

253
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:07,669
She was just about to answer
when I got called away.

254
00:14:07,711 --> 00:14:10,115
I haven't noticed her
avoiding you.

255
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,950
You sure
you're not imagining things?

256
00:14:11,989 --> 00:14:14,223
Our paths haven't crossed
in days.

257
00:14:14,261 --> 00:14:15,787
Well, it's a big station.

258
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:20,205
The truth is, you want
to spend time with her

259
00:14:20,243 --> 00:14:22,373
so it seems
that she's never around.

260
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,148
There's something going on

261
00:14:24,186 --> 00:14:26,385
and I'm going to find out
what it is when she gets here.

262
00:14:26,426 --> 00:14:27,588
I told her I'd like to discuss

263
00:14:27,629 --> 00:14:30,295
the results
of her last medical exam.

264
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,204
Isn't that unethical
or something?

265
00:14:32,241 --> 00:14:34,075
Well...

266
00:14:34,112 --> 00:14:35,742
Is that Odo?

267
00:14:37,388 --> 00:14:39,359
Part of him, anyway.

268
00:14:39,393 --> 00:14:40,988
Oh, never mind.

269
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,021
I don't want to know.

270
00:14:43,036 --> 00:14:44,562
Computer

271
00:14:44,606 --> 00:14:47,603
begin a morphogenic
enzyme analysis.

272
00:14:50,722 --> 00:14:51,691
Hi.

273
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,988
Ezri.

274
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:54,055
Hi.

275
00:14:54,098 --> 00:14:56,126
Um, you wanted to see me?

276
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,300
Yes. Come on in.

277
00:15:05,561 --> 00:15:08,363
Well, um, it was good
running into you.

278
00:15:08,401 --> 00:15:10,167
I haven't seen you in days.

279
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,418
So...

280
00:15:15,462 --> 00:15:18,300
You said something
about my test results?

281
00:15:18,336 --> 00:15:19,703
Of course.

282
00:15:19,739 --> 00:15:21,208
Here it is.

283
00:15:23,249 --> 00:15:24,879
You know, uh...

284
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,654
we never finished
our conversation

285
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:28,993
the other day.

286
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,796
Our conversation?

287
00:15:30,835 --> 00:15:32,430
Yes, at Quark's.

288
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:36,006
You were telling me, uh,
why, uh, you were avoiding me.

289
00:15:40,828 --> 00:15:44,166
Well, I guess now
is as good a time as any.

290
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,079
Well, it goes back
to when Worf and I

291
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:52,090
were held prisoner by the Breen.

292
00:15:52,124 --> 00:15:53,992
We spent a lot of time together.

293
00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:54,998
Naturally.

294
00:15:55,032 --> 00:15:56,228
And you can imagine

295
00:15:56,268 --> 00:15:58,934
that it would bring up
all sorts of old feelings.

296
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,707
Sure.

297
00:16:00,746 --> 00:16:04,518
And well, one thing led
to another and...

298
00:16:04,556 --> 00:16:06,790
Ezri, you don't have
to say anymore.

299
00:16:06,828 --> 00:16:08,594
But I want to.

300
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:11,105
No, really.

301
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:14,113
Um, I wish you both
all the happiness

302
00:16:14,147 --> 00:16:15,116
in the world.

303
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,244
Who?

304
00:16:16,287 --> 00:16:17,551
You and Worf.

305
00:16:18,827 --> 00:16:20,957
No, Julian, that's not...

306
00:16:20,999 --> 00:16:22,902
Ezri, there's no need
to explain.

307
00:16:22,937 --> 00:16:24,908
No, you don't understand.

308
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,278
What I'm trying
to tell you is that...

309
00:16:27,315 --> 00:16:28,579
I'm in love...

310
00:16:28,618 --> 00:16:30,178
Oh, my God.

311
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:32,422
What?

312
00:16:32,461 --> 00:16:34,865
Julian, what's wrong?

313
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,254
I was running a scan
on the sample you left me

314
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:46,162
when I noticed
something... unusual.

315
00:16:46,197 --> 00:16:48,795
Unusual in what way?

316
00:16:48,838 --> 00:16:52,780
The disease
that's killing your people...

317
00:16:52,815 --> 00:16:54,547
you're infected.

318
00:17:04,879 --> 00:17:06,941
My guess is you became infected

319
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:08,819
when you linked
with the female shape-shifter.

320
00:17:08,857 --> 00:17:10,487
Are you sure about this?

321
00:17:10,527 --> 00:17:12,623
He doesn't have any symptoms.

322
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,569
So far, but from what I can tell

323
00:17:14,605 --> 00:17:16,473
the virus is replicating quickly

324
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:19,507
and it may not be long before
symptoms start to surface.

325
00:17:19,551 --> 00:17:21,351
Well, we have to get you
back to the station.

326
00:17:21,456 --> 00:17:23,256
No. We have a mission
to accomplish.

327
00:17:23,294 --> 00:17:24,695
I intend to see it through.

328
00:17:24,731 --> 00:17:25,700
Odo...

329
00:17:25,734 --> 00:17:27,033
It's all right.

330
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:29,041
At this point,
there's not much I can do

331
00:17:29,075 --> 00:17:31,547
but I feel confident
that's going to change.

332
00:17:31,582 --> 00:17:32,710
What do you mean?

333
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:34,723
I'm running a series of tests

334
00:17:34,757 --> 00:17:35,953
on the sample that you left me

335
00:17:35,993 --> 00:17:37,861
and I've asked Starfleet Medical
to send the results

336
00:17:37,898 --> 00:17:39,960
from the tests they ran on you
a few years ago.

337
00:17:40,003 --> 00:17:41,165
By comparing the results

338
00:17:41,207 --> 00:17:43,702
I might be able to figure out
how this virus works

339
00:17:43,746 --> 00:17:45,306
and that may well lead
to a cure.

340
00:17:45,351 --> 00:17:47,049
Thank you, Julian.

341
00:17:52,737 --> 00:17:55,301
We should be crossing
into Dominion space

342
00:17:55,344 --> 00:17:57,042
in just a few minutes.

343
00:17:57,082 --> 00:18:00,751
I'd better scan
for enemy patrols.

344
00:19:04,256 --> 00:19:07,823
What have you been keeping
from me, my sweet?

345
00:19:07,865 --> 00:19:11,398
What dark secrets?

346
00:19:29,121 --> 00:19:30,454
Dukat!

347
00:19:30,491 --> 00:19:33,465
Adami... help me.

348
00:19:33,499 --> 00:19:35,129
You fool!

349
00:19:36,139 --> 00:19:38,577
I can't see.

350
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:40,205
I warned you...

351
00:19:40,249 --> 00:19:44,420
the text of the <i>Kosst Amojan</i>
is for my eyes alone.

352
00:20:03,175 --> 00:20:06,206
Today, we honor
our brother Martok

353
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:11,195
in the manner...
Kahless taught us.

354
00:20:22,157 --> 00:20:24,287
I accept this honor

355
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,996
in the name
of the House of Martok

356
00:20:27,037 --> 00:20:32,073
and ask only to be allowed
to continue to serve the Empire.

357
00:20:36,595 --> 00:20:38,463
Martok!

358
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,630
We're next.

359
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:44,980
Martok! Martok! Martok!

360
00:20:45,017 --> 00:20:46,851
You're kidding.

361
00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:48,051
I wish I were.

362
00:20:49,094 --> 00:20:52,763
Martok! Martok!

363
00:21:00,123 --> 00:21:01,957
You have done well.

364
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:04,592
Thank you for the help,
my friend.

365
00:21:08,912 --> 00:21:10,245
It still stings.

366
00:21:10,282 --> 00:21:12,014
That's what the bloodwine
is for.

367
00:21:12,054 --> 00:21:13,957
Congratulations, General.

368
00:21:13,992 --> 00:21:15,758
Martok...

369
00:21:15,797 --> 00:21:18,497
how does it feel to be
the most famous warrior

370
00:21:18,537 --> 00:21:19,767
in the Empire?

371
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:23,111
I am grateful for the
opportunity to serve.

372
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,916
And you've served well

373
00:21:24,954 --> 00:21:26,514
but you've borne
the burden of this war

374
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:27,584
for a long time.

375
00:21:27,628 --> 00:21:29,292
I do it gladly

376
00:21:29,332 --> 00:21:33,435
and I'll keep on fighting
until the victory is ours.

377
00:21:33,476 --> 00:21:34,775
No, my friend.

378
00:21:34,813 --> 00:21:37,810
I can't ask you
to carry this weight forever.

379
00:21:37,854 --> 00:21:43,233
It's time for me to take
a more active role in this war.

380
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:49,147
As of today, I'm assuming
direct command of our forces.

381
00:21:55,834 --> 00:21:59,799
Chancellor, I...
I don't understand.

382
00:21:59,844 --> 00:22:05,017
Are you unsatisfied with the way
I have performed my duties?

383
00:22:05,058 --> 00:22:07,394
Would I have given you
the Star of Kahless

384
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,626
if I was not satisfied?

385
00:22:08,667 --> 00:22:11,469
You should be happy
you're a warrior again.

386
00:22:11,508 --> 00:22:14,380
No more meetings,
no more reports to file.

387
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,563
You'll be out there
savoring the heat of battle.

388
00:22:15,562 --> 00:22:18,296
You'll be out there
savoring the heat of battle.

389
00:22:18,336 --> 00:22:19,498
I envy you.

390
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:22,707
I intend to see an end
to this war, and soon.

391
00:22:22,748 --> 00:22:26,656
The Dominion will rue
the day they heard my name!

392
00:22:37,452 --> 00:22:40,050
No, I don't want to talk
to Lieutenant Douglas.

393
00:22:40,093 --> 00:22:42,657
I've already talked
to Lieutenant Douglas.

394
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,398
I need a copy
of these test results.

395
00:22:44,438 --> 00:22:46,409
My patient's life is at stake.

396
00:22:46,443 --> 00:22:47,537
I wish I could help

397
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:50,849
but as I said, the files
you requested are classified.

398
00:22:50,887 --> 00:22:54,852
Why would Odo's medical records
be classified?

399
00:22:54,897 --> 00:22:56,925
They are.
That's all I know.

400
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,804
I want to talk
to your supervising officer.

401
00:22:58,842 --> 00:23:01,041
You did... Lieutenant Douglas.

402
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,552
Then I want to talk to her
supervising officer, Ensign.

403
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,714
I'll patch you through

404
00:23:04,757 --> 00:23:06,956
but he's going to tell you
the same thing.

405
00:23:10,605 --> 00:23:12,165
Commander Hilliard here.

406
00:23:12,209 --> 00:23:14,180
Ah, Commander.

407
00:23:14,214 --> 00:23:17,586
I was hoping you could, uh,
sort out this situation for me.

408
00:23:17,657 --> 00:23:19,959
I realize that the files
I requested are classified

409
00:23:19,996 --> 00:23:22,468
but given the circumstances,
I was hoping you would be able

410
00:23:22,502 --> 00:23:24,940
to understand the need
for some expediency.

411
00:23:24,975 --> 00:23:26,274
Of course.

412
00:23:26,313 --> 00:23:28,842
You wouldn't mind answering
a few questions?

413
00:23:28,886 --> 00:23:31,792
Um... of course not,
if it's necessary.

414
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:35,496
Now, you've requested Security
Chief Odo's medical records

415
00:23:35,536 --> 00:23:36,835
from Stardate...

416
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,137
49419, sir.

417
00:23:38,176 --> 00:23:39,475
And you state

418
00:23:39,514 --> 00:23:41,610
that he has contracted
the morphogenic virus

419
00:23:41,652 --> 00:23:43,247
that's infected the Founders.

420
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:44,418
Correct.

421
00:23:44,459 --> 00:23:45,928
How did he contract it?

422
00:23:45,964 --> 00:23:48,528
Presumably when he linked
with one of them, sir.

423
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,906
You're saying that he's been
in contact with the enemy?

424
00:23:50,943 --> 00:23:52,242
Yes, but not recently.

425
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,012
It happened over a year ago.

426
00:23:54,051 --> 00:23:55,851
Now, I assume that you've done

427
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:58,158
your own scans of Odo
over the years.

428
00:23:58,195 --> 00:23:59,323
Of course.

429
00:23:59,365 --> 00:24:01,131
Then why do you need ours?

430
00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:04,575
To use as a point of comparison
in hopes of finding a cure, sir.

431
00:24:04,612 --> 00:24:05,774
A cure?

432
00:24:05,815 --> 00:24:07,284
That's right.

433
00:24:10,962 --> 00:24:12,956
Is there anything else, sir?

434
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,632
No. No, that pretty much
covers it.

435
00:24:15,674 --> 00:24:18,476
Good. So, um,
when can I expect to receive

436
00:24:18,515 --> 00:24:20,007
a copy of these files?

437
00:24:20,052 --> 00:24:22,456
I'm afraid
those files are classified.

438
00:24:22,491 --> 00:24:25,293
But... I thought
you just asked me

439
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:28,364
all these questions in order
to clear me to receive them.

440
00:24:28,407 --> 00:24:29,603
No, no, you misunderstood.

441
00:24:29,644 --> 00:24:30,874
I can't release those files

442
00:24:30,914 --> 00:24:33,044
to anyone that doesn't have
Sigma Nine Clearance.

443
00:24:33,086 --> 00:24:37,223
Listen, I don't give a damn
about Sigma Nine Clearance!

444
00:24:37,263 --> 00:24:39,895
All I care about is finding
a cure for this disease!

445
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:41,737
I fail to see
why you're so determined

446
00:24:41,842 --> 00:24:44,076
to cure a disease
that infects our enemy.

447
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:45,379
We're at war, Doctor.

448
00:24:45,418 --> 00:24:47,754
The Founders have nothing
to do with it.

449
00:24:47,858 --> 00:24:49,259
Odo's life is at stake!

450
00:24:49,294 --> 00:24:50,854
Odo, who by your own admission

451
00:24:50,899 --> 00:24:53,063
has been known to consort
with the enemy.

452
00:24:54,508 --> 00:24:57,880
Sir, you have to understand
the circumstances.

453
00:24:57,917 --> 00:25:00,013
I don't care
about the circumstances.

454
00:25:00,056 --> 00:25:01,457
If you find a cure

455
00:25:01,493 --> 00:25:03,361
there's a good chance
it'll fall into Dominion hands.

456
00:25:03,398 --> 00:25:06,098
That's a risk that Starfleet
Medical is not willing to take.

457
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:09,078
Request for the files is denied.

458
00:25:09,113 --> 00:25:11,745
Now, if I were you,
I would drop this matter.

459
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,984
Otherwise, I'll have to refer it
to Starfleet Security.

460
00:25:24,486 --> 00:25:27,460
Sounds like a typical bureaucrat
flexing his muscles.

461
00:25:27,494 --> 00:25:28,656
No, it was more than that.

462
00:25:28,697 --> 00:25:30,600
He practically accused me
of being a traitor.

463
00:25:30,635 --> 00:25:32,799
Made it sound like I was
in league with the Dominion

464
00:25:32,908 --> 00:25:34,343
just because I
wanted to help Odo.

465
00:25:34,378 --> 00:25:37,614
Maybe the attack on Starfleet
Headquarters has him spooked.

466
00:25:37,653 --> 00:25:38,815
You know, guys like Hilliard

467
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:40,952
are used to sitting behind
their desks, not under them.

468
00:25:42,733 --> 00:25:45,365
If only I could get ahold
of that file.

469
00:25:45,407 --> 00:25:47,310
Maybe the Captain
can request it.

470
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:49,579
Well, does he have Sigma Nine
Clearance, whatever that is?

471
00:25:49,617 --> 00:25:52,385
For Odo's sake,
we better hope so.

472
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:31,084
Welcome to the headquarters

473
00:26:31,126 --> 00:26:33,222
of the Cardassian
Liberation Front.

474
00:26:33,264 --> 00:26:36,363
It's been a long time.

475
00:26:37,709 --> 00:26:39,201
Yes, it has.

476
00:26:39,247 --> 00:26:41,411
Did you bring the
supplies we requested?

477
00:26:41,452 --> 00:26:43,822
Food replicators, weapons...

478
00:26:43,858 --> 00:26:45,852
I think you'll find
everything you've asked for.

479
00:26:45,897 --> 00:26:47,025
Excellent.

480
00:26:47,067 --> 00:26:48,468
The Cardassian people

481
00:26:48,503 --> 00:26:51,203
won't forget
the Federation's generosity.

482
00:26:51,244 --> 00:26:52,304
How nice.

483
00:26:52,348 --> 00:26:54,650
And now that the formalities
are over with

484
00:26:54,686 --> 00:26:56,954
let's try to remember
that our enemy

485
00:26:57,059 --> 00:26:59,965
is the Dominion
and not each other.

486
00:27:00,034 --> 00:27:04,535
I don't need to be reminded
who my enemies are.

487
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:14,795
A resistance organization
is structured into cells...

488
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:17,677
autonomous groups
of ten or 20 people.

489
00:27:17,713 --> 00:27:19,947
That way, if anyone
gets captured

490
00:27:19,986 --> 00:27:21,046
their ability to compromise

491
00:27:21,089 --> 00:27:23,584
the entire organization
is limited.

492
00:27:23,629 --> 00:27:26,067
They can't be forced to name
names that they don't know.

493
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:28,438
The Obsidian Order
worked the same way.

494
00:27:28,474 --> 00:27:31,106
We have to decentralize
your operation.

495
00:27:31,148 --> 00:27:33,620
Having all your men
in one place is just too risky.

496
00:27:33,655 --> 00:27:35,181
If we scatter our resources

497
00:27:35,225 --> 00:27:37,424
we won't be able
to defend ourselves

498
00:27:37,465 --> 00:27:38,991
against a Dominion assault.

499
00:27:39,101 --> 00:27:42,371
And if you stay in one place,
they can wipe out

500
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:45,385
your entire resistance movement
in one attack.

501
00:27:45,418 --> 00:27:47,446
Smaller groups are safer.

502
00:27:47,491 --> 00:27:49,759
They're harder to track down.

503
00:27:49,796 --> 00:27:52,291
I'll have my men investigate
possible locations

504
00:27:52,336 --> 00:27:53,635
for other bases.

505
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:54,903
Good.

506
00:27:54,943 --> 00:27:56,412
Now, Odo and Garak

507
00:27:56,447 --> 00:27:58,384
have been looking over
your intelligence reports

508
00:27:58,418 --> 00:28:00,355
and they came up with a list
of vulnerable facilities

509
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:02,520
for us to target.

510
00:28:02,563 --> 00:28:04,762
The weapons depot
on Adarak Prime

511
00:28:04,801 --> 00:28:07,365
is protected by only a single
garrison and there's

512
00:28:07,409 --> 00:28:10,383
a weakness in their
perimeter defenses.

513
00:28:10,416 --> 00:28:13,254
A small group could infiltrate
the compound and disable...

514
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:16,732
Adarak Prime is defended
by a Cardassian garrison.

515
00:28:16,766 --> 00:28:18,828
That's correct.

516
00:28:18,872 --> 00:28:20,502
You expect us to attack
our own people?

517
00:28:20,543 --> 00:28:23,038
If necessary, yes.

518
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:25,054
That's out of the question.

519
00:28:25,155 --> 00:28:26,715
I agree.

520
00:28:26,758 --> 00:28:29,560
We'll limit ourselves
to targets defended

521
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,400
by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen.

522
00:28:31,438 --> 00:28:34,844
Well, believe me,
I understand how you feel.

523
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,075
During the occupation

524
00:28:36,184 --> 00:28:38,622
I didn't want to attack
any facility

525
00:28:38,656 --> 00:28:41,094
that had a Bajoran
working in it, but I did it

526
00:28:41,129 --> 00:28:43,601
because they were collaborators.

527
00:28:43,636 --> 00:28:45,766
They were working
with the enemy.

528
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:48,646
We're not Bajorans.

529
00:28:48,682 --> 00:28:50,950
We don't kill our own.

530
00:28:50,988 --> 00:28:53,985
Well, then, you might as well
just give up right now

531
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:57,004
because the minute
that the Dominion realizes

532
00:28:57,038 --> 00:28:58,906
that you will not attack
your own people

533
00:28:58,942 --> 00:28:59,911
they will station

534
00:28:59,944 --> 00:29:02,314
a Cardassian
at every base they have.

535
00:29:02,351 --> 00:29:03,752
She's right.

536
00:29:03,789 --> 00:29:06,523
The Founders won't hesitate
to play your own people

537
00:29:06,562 --> 00:29:07,531
against you.

538
00:29:07,565 --> 00:29:10,367
Anyone who is not
fighting with you

539
00:29:10,405 --> 00:29:12,535
is fighting against you.

540
00:29:17,858 --> 00:29:19,327
You were saying

541
00:29:19,361 --> 00:29:21,667
the Adarak perimeter
defenses are vulnerable.

542
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,597
Damar!

543
00:29:22,703 --> 00:29:24,571
Not another word, Rusot.

544
00:29:26,045 --> 00:29:27,709
Continue.

545
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,618
We would need to disable

546
00:29:29,688 --> 00:29:31,852
the garrison's
security protocols.

547
00:29:31,894 --> 00:29:34,560
I believe
that's where I step in.

548
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:40,741
I'd love to have seen
Hilliard's face

549
00:29:40,784 --> 00:29:43,690
when he realized Captain Sisko
had Sigma Nine Clearance.

550
00:29:45,863 --> 00:29:47,561
So... is the file worth

551
00:29:47,601 --> 00:29:49,036
all the trouble
you had to go through?

552
00:29:49,071 --> 00:29:50,472
There's more data here
than I expected.

553
00:29:50,508 --> 00:29:53,414
Starfleet Medical
certainly were thorough.

554
00:29:53,449 --> 00:29:55,147
Oh, by the way...

555
00:29:55,188 --> 00:29:57,159
what happened with you and Ezri?

556
00:29:58,729 --> 00:30:00,028
Don't ask.

557
00:30:00,067 --> 00:30:01,263
Go on.

558
00:30:01,303 --> 00:30:04,105
Actually,
she got involved with Worf.

559
00:30:04,144 --> 00:30:05,306
What?

560
00:30:05,347 --> 00:30:06,680
She told you that?

561
00:30:06,717 --> 00:30:08,620
Well, not in so many words.

562
00:30:08,655 --> 00:30:11,389
Julian...

563
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:13,698
I had a drink with Worf
the other day.

564
00:30:13,735 --> 00:30:16,207
He told me that he and Ezri
were just friends.

565
00:30:16,242 --> 00:30:18,476
You must have
misunderstood her.

566
00:30:18,514 --> 00:30:21,488
I suppose it's possible.

567
00:30:21,522 --> 00:30:23,516
I mean, she didn't exactly
come out and say it.

568
00:30:23,561 --> 00:30:24,530
Well, did you at least

569
00:30:24,564 --> 00:30:26,398
find out
why she's been avoiding you?

570
00:30:26,435 --> 00:30:27,597
No.

571
00:30:30,914 --> 00:30:32,110
That's odd.

572
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,449
What?

573
00:30:33,487 --> 00:30:34,922
The dispersal pattern

574
00:30:34,957 --> 00:30:37,191
in this resonance scan...
I've seen it before.

575
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,529
What do you mean?

576
00:30:38,566 --> 00:30:39,967
When I first came to the station

577
00:30:40,003 --> 00:30:42,339
I had to familiarize myself
with Odo's physiology.

578
00:30:42,376 --> 00:30:45,441
Dr. Mora was kind enough
to share his data with me.

579
00:30:45,484 --> 00:30:46,976
This looks like the scan

580
00:30:47,022 --> 00:30:49,460
he did when he first found Odo.

581
00:30:49,494 --> 00:30:51,294
Are you sure?

582
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:52,768
There's a lot of numbers there.

583
00:30:52,804 --> 00:30:54,832
I saw it with my own eyes
not seven years ago.

584
00:30:54,875 --> 00:30:56,174
Huh. You really are

585
00:30:56,212 --> 00:30:57,738
genetically enhanced,
aren't you?

586
00:30:57,783 --> 00:30:59,252
According to the date

587
00:30:59,287 --> 00:31:01,589
this scan was done when Odo
was at Starfleet Medical.

588
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:03,654
Two different scans can't have

589
00:31:03,698 --> 00:31:05,601
exactly the same
dispersal patterns?

590
00:31:05,636 --> 00:31:07,539
It's impossible.

591
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:09,809
Someone took Dr. Mora's
results and built up

592
00:31:09,848 --> 00:31:11,716
a phony medical
workup around them.

593
00:31:12,521 --> 00:31:15,153
This isn't Odo's file.

594
00:31:15,195 --> 00:31:16,357
They sent a fake.

595
00:31:18,036 --> 00:31:19,802
Oh, I can't believe
Starfleet Medical

596
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,472
would actually
make up a fake file

597
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:23,847
just to throw you off.

598
00:31:23,884 --> 00:31:25,251
You're right.

599
00:31:25,288 --> 00:31:29,391
It isn't something
Starfleet Medical would do.

600
00:31:29,432 --> 00:31:31,232
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

601
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,739
Section 31.

602
00:31:32,774 --> 00:31:34,870
An organization that's prepared

603
00:31:34,913 --> 00:31:37,681
to do whatever it takes
to "protect" the Federation

604
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,386
wouldn't even blink
at doing something like this.

605
00:31:40,427 --> 00:31:42,489
They don't want me
to find a cure.

606
00:31:42,532 --> 00:31:45,734
They're afraid the Founders
will get hold of it.

607
00:31:45,774 --> 00:31:48,008
And to keep that
from happening...

608
00:31:48,047 --> 00:31:50,211
they're willing to let Odo die.

609
00:31:55,366 --> 00:31:58,100
First he gives me a medal,
then he takes over my command.

610
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,804
It makes no sense.

611
00:31:59,844 --> 00:32:03,250
Our people have come to see you
as a savior of the Empire.

612
00:32:03,286 --> 00:32:05,622
That is something
Gowron cannot tolerate.

613
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:07,893
He wants to be its savior.

614
00:32:07,965 --> 00:32:09,366
What's he afraid of?

615
00:32:09,402 --> 00:32:11,236
That I'm going
to challenge his position?

616
00:32:11,274 --> 00:32:13,268
I have no interest in politics.

617
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,713
I'm a soldier.

618
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:18,351
By the hand of Kahless...

619
00:32:18,392 --> 00:32:21,457
I've earned my position.

620
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,334
I've risen through the ranks,
fought countless battles

621
00:32:23,371 --> 00:32:24,931
and what has he done?

622
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:28,415
Schemed and plotted
his way to power.

623
00:32:28,452 --> 00:32:30,856
His military experience
is limited.

624
00:32:30,891 --> 00:32:33,261
He is not
half the tactician you are.

625
00:32:33,297 --> 00:32:38,004
Many brave warriors have given
their lives in this war.

626
00:32:43,691 --> 00:32:49,970
Whatever Gowron's motives are,
it is our duty to help him

627
00:32:50,008 --> 00:32:51,979
defeat the Dominion.

628
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:54,747
We owe it
to our fallen comrades.

629
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:59,756
I am honored
to be part of your House.

630
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,398
Hmm...

631
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,670
Well...

632
00:33:07,052 --> 00:33:09,684
I had better gather my things.

633
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:15,028
This office belongs
to Gowron now.

634
00:33:26,369 --> 00:33:27,999
How's the food?

635
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,738
Replicated.

636
00:33:30,947 --> 00:33:33,043
Are you going to ask him or not?

637
00:33:33,153 --> 00:33:34,783
I wouldn't recommend it.

638
00:33:34,824 --> 00:33:37,821
It's a legitimate
question, Garak.

639
00:33:37,865 --> 00:33:38,993
Maybe I just don't think

640
00:33:39,034 --> 00:33:40,560
it's a proper subject
for discussion

641
00:33:40,606 --> 00:33:43,603
not if we're all supposed
to be getting along.

642
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:49,094
Well, if you won't ask him,
I will.

643
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:50,721
Odo.

644
00:33:53,706 --> 00:33:58,116
When you were the Head
of Security on Terok Nor

645
00:33:58,185 --> 00:34:00,555
what did you think
was going to happen

646
00:34:00,591 --> 00:34:03,588
to the Bajoran
prisoners you arrested?

647
00:34:03,632 --> 00:34:05,227
You don't have to answer that.

648
00:34:05,269 --> 00:34:06,864
Why not?

649
00:34:06,907 --> 00:34:08,399
It's a legitimate question.

650
00:34:08,444 --> 00:34:10,472
Only if you want
to provoke an argument.

651
00:34:10,517 --> 00:34:12,215
Just as I said.

652
00:34:12,254 --> 00:34:13,849
I expected

653
00:34:13,892 --> 00:34:17,959
that my prisoners would
be dealt with justly...

654
00:34:19,138 --> 00:34:22,408
but I soon came to realize

655
00:34:22,448 --> 00:34:26,356
that Cardassians have
little interest in justice.

656
00:34:26,391 --> 00:34:28,123
Ah.

657
00:34:28,196 --> 00:34:32,229
Well, then, why didn't
you resign in protest?

658
00:34:34,177 --> 00:34:35,943
What are you getting at?

659
00:34:35,982 --> 00:34:37,451
Nerys, don't.

660
00:34:37,487 --> 00:34:40,153
I believe you've
struck a nerve.

661
00:34:40,193 --> 00:34:43,099
Apparently, Commander Kira
doesn't like to be reminded

662
00:34:43,135 --> 00:34:45,903
that her lover collaborated
with her enemies.

663
00:34:45,942 --> 00:34:47,411
Odo wasn't a collaborator.

664
00:34:47,446 --> 00:34:50,750
I suppose that depends
on your definition

665
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:51,882
of collaborator.

666
00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:52,893
Nerys...

667
00:34:52,926 --> 00:34:54,361
it isn't worth it.

668
00:34:54,397 --> 00:34:56,835
Odo's right, Commander.

669
00:34:58,541 --> 00:35:00,705
I guess we have
a difference of opinion.

670
00:35:06,428 --> 00:35:08,331
You don't know
how lucky you are.

671
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:09,563
Oh? Why is that?

672
00:35:09,603 --> 00:35:10,799
She would have killed you.

673
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,543
I only wish she had tried.

674
00:35:24,174 --> 00:35:27,342
Well, I'm glad
we're in agreement.

675
00:35:27,382 --> 00:35:29,911
If you want to knock over
some supplies, be my guest.

676
00:35:29,955 --> 00:35:32,484
You did the right thing, Nerys.

677
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,863
The Dominion is our enemy

678
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,130
not Rusot.

679
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:36,696
I don't need you
to remind me of that!

680
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,209
Oh...

681
00:35:40,249 --> 00:35:42,687
I'm sorry. I'm...

682
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:44,751
I'm sorry.

683
00:35:47,969 --> 00:35:50,237
It's just, uh...

684
00:35:50,275 --> 00:35:52,747
it's just so hot in here.

685
00:35:52,782 --> 00:35:54,412
Well...

686
00:35:54,453 --> 00:35:56,447
the Cardassians
do love the heat.

687
00:35:56,492 --> 00:35:57,859
I don't.

688
00:35:57,895 --> 00:36:01,301
I'm going to go see
if I can find a cooling unit.

689
00:36:01,338 --> 00:36:03,002
I'll come with you.

690
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:04,909
It's all right.

691
00:36:04,946 --> 00:36:07,714
I promise I won't hit anyone.

692
00:36:07,754 --> 00:36:09,414
I'll hold you to that.

693
00:36:36,082 --> 00:36:37,712
Now, you're not going
to believe this.

694
00:36:37,787 --> 00:36:38,847
Believe what?

695
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:42,092
Damar actually had a cooling
unit waiting for us.

696
00:36:49,851 --> 00:36:50,750
What's wrong?

697
00:36:50,821 --> 00:36:52,451
Nothing.

698
00:36:52,491 --> 00:36:53,960
I was just worried

699
00:36:53,996 --> 00:36:56,434
that you might have had
another run-in with Rusot.

700
00:36:56,469 --> 00:36:57,699
Don't worry.

701
00:36:57,739 --> 00:36:59,573
I'm going to keep a cool head.

702
00:36:59,611 --> 00:37:03,178
Assuming, of course,
I can get this thing to work.

703
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,348
Adami...

704
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:19,486
are you there?

705
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,682
I'm here.

706
00:37:32,429 --> 00:37:34,901
I spoke with the doctor.

707
00:37:34,935 --> 00:37:38,570
She says she can find
nothing wrong with your eyes.

708
00:37:38,611 --> 00:37:40,479
Then she's incompetent.

709
00:37:40,516 --> 00:37:43,684
A Cardassian doctor
would have cured me by now.

710
00:37:43,725 --> 00:37:46,527
You still don't understand,
do you?

711
00:37:46,566 --> 00:37:49,836
The Pah-wraiths
have taken your sight

712
00:37:49,941 --> 00:37:52,413
in punishment
for your arrogance.

713
00:37:52,447 --> 00:37:54,646
Only they can
give it back to you.

714
00:37:54,687 --> 00:37:57,593
I meant them no disrespect.

715
00:37:57,627 --> 00:37:59,861
I only wanted to study the book

716
00:37:59,967 --> 00:38:03,271
to see if I could help you learn
how to release them.

717
00:38:03,308 --> 00:38:06,578
You wanted to see
if you could do it without me.

718
00:38:08,288 --> 00:38:09,952
Well, you can't.

719
00:38:09,993 --> 00:38:12,591
Pray with me, Adami.

720
00:38:14,404 --> 00:38:17,640
Help me earn
the Pah-wraiths' forgiveness.

721
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:20,379
I'm afraid you'll have
to do that on your own.

722
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,411
Door.

723
00:38:24,865 --> 00:38:27,531
Deputy Bodan will show you out.

724
00:38:27,572 --> 00:38:31,639
"Show me out..."
I don't understand.

725
00:38:31,683 --> 00:38:34,987
Well, you need
a lesson in humility.

726
00:38:35,024 --> 00:38:37,758
I'm going to see
that you get it.

727
00:38:37,799 --> 00:38:40,499
By putting me out on the street?

728
00:38:40,539 --> 00:38:43,604
You'll find the Bajoran people
are very kind.

729
00:38:43,647 --> 00:38:47,886
A blind beggar will elicit
their sympathies, I'm certain

730
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:51,229
and with any luck, you'll earn
enough to eat, and perhaps

731
00:38:51,267 --> 00:38:53,762
even enough
for shelter each night.

732
00:38:53,806 --> 00:38:55,777
You're not...

733
00:38:55,811 --> 00:38:56,837
you're not serious?

734
00:38:56,881 --> 00:38:58,077
You may return

735
00:38:58,118 --> 00:38:59,952
when you've
proven yourself worthy

736
00:39:00,023 --> 00:39:03,658
and your sight
has been restored.

737
00:39:03,699 --> 00:39:05,465
Bodan.

738
00:39:05,504 --> 00:39:08,238
Adami, lis...

739
00:39:08,277 --> 00:39:10,647
Adami...

740
00:39:10,684 --> 00:39:12,655
Adami, listen to me, please!

741
00:39:12,689 --> 00:39:14,284
Adami!

742
00:39:22,748 --> 00:39:23,717
You see?

743
00:39:24,854 --> 00:39:26,449
Enter.

744
00:39:27,661 --> 00:39:29,291
Come in, come in.

745
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:36,848
I've been studying
the strategic situation.

746
00:39:36,885 --> 00:39:39,687
I want to share my thoughts
with you.

747
00:39:39,725 --> 00:39:41,217
Of course.

748
00:39:41,263 --> 00:39:42,995
Come.

749
00:39:43,101 --> 00:39:45,265
The Dominion is deploying

750
00:39:45,306 --> 00:39:48,576
its fleet in preparation
for a final offensive.

751
00:39:48,616 --> 00:39:51,886
They're destroying
our ships one by one.

752
00:39:51,924 --> 00:39:54,260
We must hold the line
until the Federation

753
00:39:54,297 --> 00:39:56,131
and Romulan fleets
become operational again.

754
00:39:56,169 --> 00:39:58,333
No, don't you see?

755
00:39:58,374 --> 00:40:01,176
That's exactly what the enemy
is expecting.

756
00:40:01,215 --> 00:40:03,619
The time to act is now.

757
00:40:03,655 --> 00:40:05,489
What are you proposing,
Chancellor?

758
00:40:05,526 --> 00:40:07,554
We're going on the offensive.

759
00:40:07,598 --> 00:40:09,728
Starting tomorrow,
I'm sending sorties

760
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:11,798
deep into enemy territory

761
00:40:11,843 --> 00:40:14,976
to strike at the very heart
of the Dominion.

762
00:40:15,017 --> 00:40:18,014
But we are barely
holding the line as it is.

763
00:40:18,059 --> 00:40:20,588
We need every ship we have
to defend the border.

764
00:40:20,632 --> 00:40:22,364
What's wrong with you two?

765
00:40:22,403 --> 00:40:24,875
Don't you understand?
We must seize the day!

766
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:27,382
We are outnumbered 20 to one.

767
00:40:27,416 --> 00:40:28,612
What of it?

768
00:40:28,653 --> 00:40:30,817
The element of surprise
will be on our side.

769
00:40:30,858 --> 00:40:33,387
Chancellor, in my opinion...

770
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,368
Did I ask your opinion?

771
00:40:37,041 --> 00:40:39,137
Trust me, my friends.

772
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:42,883
I can see it all so clearly.

773
00:40:42,923 --> 00:40:45,521
While our allies sit
and do nothing

774
00:40:45,564 --> 00:40:50,167
the Klingon Empire
will score the final triumph

775
00:40:50,242 --> 00:40:51,438
over the Dominion.

776
00:40:51,478 --> 00:40:53,916
We'll be the saviors
of the Alpha Quadrant.

777
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:56,116
The glory will be ours...

778
00:40:56,158 --> 00:40:59,132
and ours alone.

779
00:41:10,528 --> 00:41:12,158
I don't know, Julian.

780
00:41:12,266 --> 00:41:14,795
If Section 31
is involved with this

781
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:16,434
maybe we should
tell the Captain.

782
00:41:16,477 --> 00:41:17,969
We've been over this, Miles.

783
00:41:18,014 --> 00:41:21,352
If we tell him, he'll have to
report it to Starfleet Command.

784
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:23,190
31 will certainly get wind of it

785
00:41:23,261 --> 00:41:25,357
and once they realize we've
figured out the files are fake

786
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,202
they'll take steps to make
sure we don't find a cure.

787
00:41:28,241 --> 00:41:30,577
Hmm. I see your point.

788
00:41:31,884 --> 00:41:33,616
What steps do you think
they might take?

789
00:41:33,654 --> 00:41:36,560
Believe me, we don't
want to find out.

790
00:41:38,032 --> 00:41:39,866
Excuse me, gentlemen.

791
00:41:41,174 --> 00:41:43,042
Is that coffee?

792
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:47,251
I figured you were probably
working on a way to help Odo.

793
00:41:47,357 --> 00:41:50,559
I thought... this is
the least I can do.

794
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:52,091
How did you know Odo was ill?

795
00:41:52,136 --> 00:41:53,800
I hear things.

796
00:41:53,841 --> 00:41:55,778
Yeah, well, keep it
under your hat, will you?

797
00:41:55,812 --> 00:41:56,781
Why?

798
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:58,283
Just do it.

799
00:41:58,352 --> 00:41:59,878
All right.

800
00:41:59,922 --> 00:42:01,756
All right, do you
still want the coffee?

801
00:42:01,794 --> 00:42:03,924
Odo would be touched
if he knew you were doing this.

802
00:42:03,967 --> 00:42:07,339
You're not going
to tell him, are you?

803
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:09,209
It'll be our little secret.

804
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,714
Good luck.

805
00:42:21,846 --> 00:42:22,837
Here you go.

806
00:42:22,882 --> 00:42:24,374
Hang on, hang on.

807
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:27,292
I'm... just trying to figure out
when Odo became infected.

808
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,727
I analyzed the sample he left

809
00:42:28,765 --> 00:42:30,702
and mapped out the life
cycle of the virus

810
00:42:30,736 --> 00:42:33,436
and programmed the computer to
calculate just how long it took

811
00:42:33,477 --> 00:42:35,141
for the virus to reach
its present level

812
00:42:35,181 --> 00:42:36,309
of concentration.

813
00:42:36,418 --> 00:42:37,478
Well, that makes sense.

814
00:42:41,263 --> 00:42:43,131
Well, according to that

815
00:42:43,169 --> 00:42:45,003
he was infected
over two years ago?

816
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,635
More than that.

817
00:42:46,677 --> 00:42:48,911
I just don't understand.

818
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:50,351
I assumed he became infected

819
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:52,984
when he linked
with the female shape-shifter.

820
00:42:53,027 --> 00:42:54,291
But if it happened that long ago

821
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:56,233
how come he's never shown
any symptoms before?

822
00:42:56,269 --> 00:42:57,670
Good question.

823
00:42:58,910 --> 00:42:59,879
Got it.

824
00:42:59,912 --> 00:43:02,282
Stardate 49419.

825
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:04,289
Almost three years ago.

826
00:43:04,323 --> 00:43:06,226
Wait a minute.

827
00:43:06,261 --> 00:43:08,061
49419...

828
00:43:10,272 --> 00:43:14,112
That's the day that Odo
was at Starfleet Medical.

829
00:43:14,149 --> 00:43:15,140
Are you sure?

830
00:43:15,185 --> 00:43:16,552
Yes.

831
00:43:16,589 --> 00:43:20,588
My God, no wonder Hilliard
wouldn't let me see the file.

832
00:43:20,632 --> 00:43:23,572
Section 31 must have created
the virus, infected Odo

833
00:43:23,607 --> 00:43:26,375
and then used him
as a carrier.

834
00:43:26,481 --> 00:43:28,384
So that when he linked
with another changeling

835
00:43:28,419 --> 00:43:29,820
he'd pass it on.

836
00:43:29,856 --> 00:43:32,020
Eventually, the entire
race would be infected.

837
00:43:32,062 --> 00:43:35,936
31 isn't just trying to stop
us from finding a cure.

838
00:43:35,972 --> 00:43:37,407
They're trying to
cover up the fact

839
00:43:37,509 --> 00:43:39,104
that they set out
to commit genocide.

840
00:43:39,147 --> 00:43:41,585
Well, if they gave
Odo this disease

841
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,021
then they must have a cure.

842
00:43:43,057 --> 00:43:44,151
We have to find a way

843
00:43:44,193 --> 00:43:45,753
to get our hands
on that cure.

844
00:43:45,798 --> 00:43:49,535
Huh... before 31 gets
their hands on us.
