1
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:08,467
O'BRIEN:
Basically, we stumbled on it
by accident.

2
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:11,804
At Chin'toka,
our entire fleet was disabled

3
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:15,933
when the Breen engaged
their energy-dampening weapon.

4
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:20,562
311 ships-- Federation, Romulan
and Klingon-- all lost power.

5
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:23,941
But one didn't--
a bird-of-prey
called the<i> Ki'tang.</i>

6
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:25,359
Why?

7
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,568
What was different
about the<i> Ki'tang?</i>

8
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:27,695
O'BRIEN:
We're not really sure.

9
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:28,737
The only thing

10
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,572
we can figure is
that just prior

11
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,700
to the engagement
their Chief Engineer

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,118
adjusted the tritium
intermix to compensate

13
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,705
for a containment problem
in the warp core.

14
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:39,999
I've ordered every ship
in the Klingon fleet

15
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:41,458
to adjust its reactor
the same way.

16
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,878
Our vessels are of
a different design.

17
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:45,713
Can this technique
be adapted

18
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,339
to protect
them as well?

19
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:48,799
Unfortunately, no.

20
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,634
Your ships are
still vulnerable,
and so are ours.

21
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:52,302
O'BRIEN:
I've sent
everything we know

22
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,137
about the Breen weapon
to the Romulan Ministry

23
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,181
of Science and to
Starfleet Engineering

24
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,266
but realistically, it's
going to take awhile

25
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,852
before they can
figure out a way

26
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:01,353
to protect our ships.

27
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:03,104
Thank you,
Mr. O'Brien.

28
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:09,653
Well, gentlemen, it seems
as if the Klingon fleet

29
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:13,824
is the only thing that stands
between us and the Dominion.

30
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:15,993
What<i> have</i> 
we come to?

31
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:23,291
MARTOK:
By tomorrow, we'll have
1,500 Klingon vessels

32
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,210
ready for deployment.

33
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,589
With the Breen,
the Cardassians
<i>and</i> the Jem'Hadar

34
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,674
you're still
outnumbered
20 to one.

35
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,760
I am aware of that, General.

36
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,971
Obviously, the Klingons can't go
head-to-head with the Dominion

37
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:38,640
but they may be able
to keep them distracted.

38
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,350
We'll operate
in small battle groups

39
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,185
going in under cloak,
engaging the enemy

40
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,063
and trying to provoke them
into pursuit.

41
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:45,981
SISKO:
With any luck

42
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:48,316
they'll be able to keep
the Dominion off-balance

43
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,611
and prevent them
from launching an offensive.

44
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:51,946
For how long?

45
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:53,572
They can't keep them
at bay forever.

46
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:55,156
No, they can't

47
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,951
but, fortunately,
we're not the only ones

48
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:58,368
the Dominion has
to contend with right now.

49
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,412
Damar's resistance
movement.

50
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:01,622
What's left of them.

51
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,040
Half his troops
were killed

52
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,583
in the assault
on Rondac.

53
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,376
They may have failed
to capture Rondac

54
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,921
but their attack sent a message
to the Cardassian people.

55
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:10,756
If the rebels can show them

56
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:12,800
that they have a chance
of succeeding

57
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,259
their support will grow.

58
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:17,387
Does the rebellion
have a chance of succeeding?

59
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,140
Yes, but they have
to adjust their tactics--

60
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,352
concentrate on small-scale,
hit-and-run attacks, sabotaging

61
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,479
key facilities.

62
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,272
Damar's a by-the-book soldier.

63
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,441
Does he have any experience
waging this kind of campaign?

64
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:32,193
No, he doesn't....

65
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:36,448
which is why we have
to send him<i> someone</i> who does.

66
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:38,784
You want me
to go behind enemy lines

67
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:41,787
and teach a bunch of<i> Cardassians</i>
how to be resistance fighters?

68
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:44,999
I'm aware of the irony,
but the tactics you used

69
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:47,250
to drive the Cardassians
off Bajor

70
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,336
are exactly
what the situation

71
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:50,587
calls for.

72
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,171
To work with Damar...

73
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:56,677
When he killed Ziyal,
he murdered an innocent girl

74
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,637
that I considered
a part of my family.

75
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:01,180
You're going to have to put
your personal feelings aside.

76
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,600
Now, whether you
like Damar or not

77
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,601
is irrelevant.

78
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,103
We need him.

79
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,938
The Dominion knows
they have to stop his rebellion

80
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,815
before it spreads,
and it's up to you

81
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:11,232
to see that
they don't.

82
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,192
It's as simple
as that.

83
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,361
Yes, sir.

84
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:19,116
I understand that Damar
and his men went into hiding

85
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:20,575
after the attack on Rondac.

86
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,994
Any idea how to locate them?

87
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:24,705
I suggest you talk
to Mr. Garak about that.

88
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:25,747
Garak?

89
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,082
He still
has contacts

90
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:28,583
on Cardassia.

91
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,336
If I were you, I would ask him
to join your team.

92
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,754
He might be useful.

93
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:36,675
Damar and Garak...

94
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,886
should be
an interesting mission.

95
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:43,969
It's very difficult
to keep a supply

96
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:46,013
of synthetic organs on hand
in a battlefield situation.

97
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,182
You never know how many livers
you're going to need.

98
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:51,935
Or, uh... how
many hearts.

99
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,062
I can imagine

100
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:57,941
but, uh, what does that
have to do with me?

101
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,276
Well, the holy grail
of organ replacement

102
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:00,861
is to be able to find a way

103
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,613
to inject the patient with
undifferentiated tissue

104
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,866
so that it can become
whatever organ is needed.

105
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:06,992
The only
problem is...

106
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,910
Doctor, get to the point.

107
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,747
I need to borrow...
a cup... of goo.

108
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,541
Excuse me?

109
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,542
Please?

110
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,877
I'll give it back.

111
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,212
You see, I
need to study

112
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:19,462
your morphogenic
matrix

113
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,340
so that I can synthesize
organic tissue

114
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,590
that can change form

115
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,591
the way your
cells do.

116
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:26,220
To use for organ replacement.

117
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,554
Exactly.

118
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:28,972
Well, can't you just...

119
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,308
oh... scan me, or something?

120
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:32,726
I need a sample.

121
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,477
It's for
a good cause.

122
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:37,898
(<i> sighs</i> )

123
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,107
All right, Doctor.

124
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,365
Just a tad more.

125
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:53,663
Thank you.

126
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,583
I am going
to want that back

127
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,960
as soon as Kira and I
return from our mission.

128
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,255
Oh. You're going with her?

129
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:03,340
She thought
I might be useful.

130
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,549
When do you leave?

131
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,386
As soon as Garak
can locate Damar.

132
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,897
WINN:
<i>I am very concerned.</i>

133
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:22,901
It's not like Solbor
to disappear this way.

134
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:26,363
Please do whatever
it takes to find him.

135
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:27,447
Yes, Eminence.

136
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:32,369
Well done.

137
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,913
I almost
believed you myself.

138
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,706
How like a Cardassian

139
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,793
to find amusement
in an old man's death.

140
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:43,797
You don't know how much I
regret having to kill him.

141
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,091
He was going
to expose us.

142
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,763
No one can be allowed
to stand in our way.

143
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,683
Remember your
place, Dukat.

144
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,561
I thought my place
was in your bed.

145
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,775
That was<i> before</i> 
I knew who you were.

146
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,235
Adami...

147
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:08,780
I'm not the same man
I was during the occupation.

148
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,325
The Pah-wraiths
have changed me.

149
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:13,452
But they can't change
what you did.

150
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:15,370
Do you really
think I could

151
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,622
let myself be touched by a man

152
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,500
whose hands are stained
with the blood of my people?

153
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,836
When we do release
the Pah-wraiths

154
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,297
from the fire caves

155
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:30,010
your hands will be stained
as well.

156
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,553
The Pah-wraiths
will spare those

157
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,348
whom they find worthy.

158
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,976
The rest are of no consequence.

159
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,022
You've been

160
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,358
studying that for days.

161
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:47,068
Perhaps I could help.

162
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:51,656
The text of the<i> Kosst Amojan</i>
is for my eyes alone.

163
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:58,330
Well, have you learned
what we have to do

164
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,832
to release the Pah-wraiths?

165
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:04,169
Only that
it's not a simple matter.

166
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,504
Leave me.

167
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:08,256
I've had enough
of your distractions.

168
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,234
ROSS:
<i>When is Gowron's ship</i>

169
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,193
due to arrive?

170
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:29,652
In the morning.

171
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:33,781
Martok seems a little nervous
about the ceremony.

172
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,116
Chancellor Gowron
is traveling

173
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,493
all the way from Kronos

174
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,745
to induct him into
the Order of Kahless.

175
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:39,787
I'd be nervous, too.

176
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:40,788
(<i> door chimes</i> )

177
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:41,831
Come in.

178
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:45,460
Good news.

179
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,711
Garak was able
to contact Damar.

180
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,588
He's provided us
with his location

181
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,174
and has requested assistance
as soon as possible.

182
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,926
So, with your permission,
I'd like to depart

183
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:53,968
first thing
tomorrow.

184
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,262
By all means.

185
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,638
Uh... there is
one other thing.

186
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,474
Yes, Mr. Garak?

187
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,642
Damar expressed concern
when I told him

188
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,853
that Colonel Kira would
be leading this mission.

189
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,398
Well, if he wants
to defeat the Dominion

190
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:08,816
he's going to have to put
his personal feelings aside.

191
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,235
He's certainly willing

192
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:11,236
to do that.

193
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,779
He knows the value

194
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,364
of your skills.

195
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,575
Damar is concerned
that his men

196
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:19,453
will see your uniform
as an affront.

197
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,246
We Cardassians
are a proud people.

198
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:22,456
Losing Bajor

199
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:24,541
to a ragtag band
of terrorists--

200
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,126
no offense--

201
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,795
was a humiliation.

202
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,923
Simply put,
taking on a Bajoran officer

203
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:35,302
as an advisor would
undermine his authority.

204
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,678
Sorry, Colonel.

205
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,347
We'll have to find
someone else

206
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,515
to head up
the mission.

207
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:43,518
No... sir.

208
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:46,854
Colonel Kira is
the best person for the job.

209
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:50,024
There's another way
around this problem.

210
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:55,738
I don't know.

211
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,073
Do you really think
it'll make

212
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,116
a difference
to the Cardassians

213
00:10:58,116 --> 00:10:59,159
that you've been given

214
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,701
a Starfleet commission?

215
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,078
You're still
a Bajoran.

216
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,371
A Bajoran with the authority

217
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,332
to speak on behalf
of the Federation.

218
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,292
You realize you're going
to have to do something

219
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,628
about your uniform as well.

220
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:12,088
I was afraid
you were going to say that.

221
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,468
Well?

222
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,221
It's a little drab.

223
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,098
This is how I appeared

224
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,642
when I worked
for the Cardassians.

225
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:27,521
Ah, well, it should
put them at ease, anyway.

226
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:29,397
I wonder

227
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:33,610
if Dr. Bashir could help us
with that nose of yours?

228
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,196
I'm only willing
to go so far.

229
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,905
Damar's men are just going
to have to get used

230
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,366
to the idea of
having me around.

231
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:42,452
Oh, they'll tolerate you
to a point.

232
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:46,623
If I were you,
I'd watch my back.

233
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:48,833
I'll see you
in the morning.

234
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,558
You see the problem.

235
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:05,808
Our food supplies
are running low.

236
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,435
We'll have to cut
back on rations

237
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,396
until we can get ahold
of some food replicators.

238
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,606
When I spoke to Garak,
I told him to bring some.

239
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:14,317
Federation food
replicators?

240
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:15,443
We are in no position
to turn down help

241
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,861
no matter where it comes from.

242
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,614
Taking help from the
Federation is bad enough

243
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:22,534
but having to take it from
that Bajoran terrorist...

244
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:25,744
Kira Nerys has certain skills
she's willing to teach us--

245
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:29,499
skills we need if we're going
to defeat the Dominion.

246
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,376
I can't believe
what I'm hearing.

247
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,002
When we were stationed
on Terok Nor

248
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,379
you used to spend hours

249
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,381
telling me
how much you despised her.

250
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,300
I did hate her.

251
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,262
That's a luxury I can no longer
afford and neither can you.

252
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,390
I need your support in this,
my friend.

253
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,485
General.
Mr. Worf.

254
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,620
Welcome to Deep
Space 9, Chancellor.

255
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,957
It's been too long, Captain.

256
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,833
You know Admiral Ross.

257
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,919
We met at Khitomer.

258
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,921
Admiral, of course.

259
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,341
Martok...

260
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,594
the man I came to honor.

261
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,097
The son of Mogh...

262
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:27,557
Chancellor.

263
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:31,603
They say you've made him
part of your House.

264
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:33,104
That's true.

265
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,570
Then what is past is past.

266
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,904
If Martok considers you

267
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,532
his brother, that's all
I need to know.

268
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:47,702
Come-- I brought a barrel
of the finest bloodwine

269
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,912
and it must
be drunk tonight!

270
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,414
(<i> laughs</i> )

271
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,082
MARTOK:
The vintage--
2309, I hope.

272
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,501
(<i> Gowron laughing</i> )

273
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,338
I guess we're
not invited.

274
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:01,924
Anyway, I finally
tracked her down to Quark's

275
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,343
and I asked her flat out

276
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,720
"Ezri, why are
you avoiding me?"

277
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,555
She was just about to answer
when I got called away.

278
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,224
I haven't noticed her
avoiding you.

279
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,892
You sure
you're not imagining things?

280
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,061
Our paths haven't crossed
in days.

281
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,854
Well, it's
a big station.

282
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:20,318
The truth is, you<i> want</i> 
to spend time with her

283
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:22,320
so it<i> seems</i> 
that she's never around.

284
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,197
There's something going on

285
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,115
and I'm going to find out
what it is when she gets here.

286
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,492
I told her I'd like to discuss

287
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:30,161
the results
of her last medical exam.

288
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,246
Isn't that unethical
or something?

289
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,040
Well...

290
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,792
Is that Odo?

291
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,337
Part of him, anyway.

292
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:40,921
Oh, never mind.

293
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,048
I don't want to know.

294
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,425
Computer

295
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,387
begin a morphogenic
enzyme analysis.

296
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,641
Hi.

297
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:52,767
Ezri.

298
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,018
Hi.

299
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,145
Um, you wanted to see me?

300
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,064
Yes. Come on in.

301
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:08,241
Well, um, it was good
running into you.

302
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,909
I haven't seen
you in days.

303
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,998
So... (<i> clears throat</i> )

304
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,959
You said something
about my test results?

305
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,545
Of course.

306
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:21,921
Here it is.

307
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,717
You know, uh...

308
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:28,553
we never finished
our conversation

309
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:29,846
the other day.

310
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,431
Our conversation?

311
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,433
Yes, at Quark's.

312
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:36,686
You were telling me, uh,
why, uh, you were avoiding me.

313
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:44,819
Well, I guess now
is as good a time as any.

314
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,950
Well, it goes back
to when Worf and I

315
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,952
were held prisoner by the Breen.

316
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,579
We spent a lot of time together.

317
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:55,496
Naturally.

318
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,081
And you
can imagine

319
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,500
that it would bring up
all sorts of old feelings.

320
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,252
Sure.

321
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:04,964
And, well, one thing led
to another and...

322
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,341
Ezri, you don't have
to say anymore.

323
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,093
But I want to.

324
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,471
No, really.

325
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:14,724
Um, I wish you both
all the happiness

326
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:15,683
in the world.

327
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:16,768
Who?

328
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,102
You and Worf.

329
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,186
(<i> computer beeping</i> )

330
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,355
No, Julian,
that's not...

331
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,190
Ezri, there's no need
to explain.

332
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,401
No, you don't
understand.

333
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,779
What I'm trying
to tell you is that...

334
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:28,947
I'm in love...

335
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:30,782
Oh, my God.

336
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,909
What?

337
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:35,453
Julian, what's wrong?

338
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,670
I was running a scan
on the sample you left me

339
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,673
when I noticed
something... unusual.

340
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:49,175
Unusual in what way?

341
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:53,262
The disease
that's killing your people...

342
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,889
you're infected.

343
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,568
My guess is you became infected

344
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,278
when you linked
with the female shape-shifter.

345
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,905
Are you sure
about this?

346
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:13,324
He doesn't have
any symptoms.

347
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,075
So far, but from what I can tell

348
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,870
the virus is replicating quickly

349
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,956
and it may not be long before
symptoms start to surface.

350
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,791
Well, we have to get you
back to the station.

351
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,710
No. We have a mission
to accomplish.

352
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,003
I intend to see it through.

353
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:25,920
Odo...

354
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,338
BASHIR:
It's all right.

355
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,590
At this point,
there's not much I can do

356
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,968
but I feel confident
that's going to change.

357
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:33,302
What do you mean?

358
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,846
I'm running a series of tests

359
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:36,514
on the sample
that you left me

360
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,432
and I've asked Starfleet Medical
to send the results

361
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,934
from the tests they ran on you
a few years ago.

362
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:41,477
By comparing the results

363
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:44,230
I might be able to figure out
how this virus works

364
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,732
and that may well lead
to a cure.

365
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,525
Thank you, Julian.

366
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,696
(<i> sighs</i> )

367
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,700
We should be crossing
into Dominion space

368
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,535
in just a few minutes.

369
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:00,997
I'd better scan
for enemy patrols.

370
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:08,106
What have you been keeping
from me, my sweet?

371
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:12,026
What dark secrets?

372
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:25,832
(<i> piercing scream</i> )

373
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,335
(<i> groaning</i> )

374
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,711
Dukat!

375
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:33,714
Adami... help me.

376
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,424
You fool!

377
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,845
I can't see.

378
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,596
I warned you--

379
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:44,517
the text of the<i> Kosst Amojan</i>
is for my eyes alone.

380
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:06,372
Today, we honor
our brother Martok

381
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:11,418
in the manner...
Kahless taught us.

382
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,390
I accept this honor

383
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,309
in the name
of the House of Martok

384
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:32,065
and ask only to be allowed
to continue to serve the Empire.

385
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:38,612
KLINGON:
Martok!

386
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,740
We're next.

387
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,869
KLINGONS (<i> chanting</i> ):
Martok! Martok! Martok!

388
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:46,829
You're kidding.

389
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:47,997
I wish I were.

390
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,207
(<i> Klingons cheering</i> )

391
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:52,752
Martok! Martok!

392
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:02,261
You have done well.

393
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,555
Thank you for the help,
my friend.

394
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:07,600
(<i> friendly growl</i> )

395
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,394
It still stings.

396
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,312
That's what the
bloodwine is for.

397
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,898
Congratulations,
General.

398
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:15,858
Martok...

399
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:18,402
how does it feel to be
the most famous warrior

400
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,820
in the Empire?

401
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,949
I am grateful for the
opportunity to serve.

402
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,909
And you've served well

403
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,619
but you've borne
the burden of this war

404
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:27,661
for a long time.

405
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,413
I do it gladly

406
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:33,251
and I'll keep on fighting
until the victory is ours.

407
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:34,752
No, my friend.

408
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:37,838
I can't ask you
to carry this weight forever.

409
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:43,219
It's time for me to take
a more active role in this war.

410
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:45,805
As of today,
I'm assuming

411
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:49,016
direct command of our forces.

412
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:59,986
Chancellor, I...
I don't understand.

413
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:04,949
Are you unsatisfied with the way
I have performed my duties?

414
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:07,201
Would I have given you
the Star of Kahless

415
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:08,577
if I was not satisfied?

416
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,413
You should be happy
you're a warrior again.

417
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:14,333
No more meetings,
no more reports to file.

418
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,876
You'll be out there

419
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,671
savoring the heat
of battle.

420
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,006
I envy you.

421
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:23,050
I intend to see an end
to this war, and soon.

422
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,846
The Dominion will rue
the day they heard my name!

423
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:40,442
No, I don't want to talk
to Lieutenant Douglas.

424
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,862
I've already talked
to Lieutenant Douglas.

425
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:44,571
I need a copy
of these test results.

426
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,282
My patient's life
is at stake.

427
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:47,867
I wish I could help

428
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:51,037
but as I said, the files
you requested are classified.

429
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:54,999
Why would Odo's medical records
be classified?

430
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:57,126
They are.
That's all I know.

431
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:59,045
I want to talk
to your supervising officer.

432
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:01,339
You did-- Lieutenant Douglas.

433
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:03,757
Then I want to talk to<i> her</i> 
supervising officer, Ensign.

434
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,259
I'll patch you through

435
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:07,011
but he's going to tell you
the same thing.

436
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,432
Commander Hilliard here.

437
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,434
Ah, Commander.

438
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:15,978
I was hoping you could, uh,

439
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:17,813
sort out this
situation for me.

440
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,149
I realize that the files
I requested are classified

441
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:22,568
but given the circumstances,
I was hoping you would be able

442
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,945
to understand the need
for some expediency.

443
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,572
Of course.

444
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,949
You wouldn't mind answering
a few questions?

445
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:31,869
Um... of course not,
if it's necessary.

446
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:35,706
Now, you've requested Security
Chief Odo's medical records

447
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:37,083
from Stardate...

448
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,084
49419, sir.

449
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:39,543
And you state

450
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,754
that he has contracted
the morphogenic virus

451
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:43,463
that's infected the Founders.

452
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:44,506
Correct.

453
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,008
How did he contract it?

454
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:48,552
Presumably when he linked
with one of them, sir.

455
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:51,097
You're saying that he's been
in contact with the enemy?

456
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:52,390
Yes, but not recently.

457
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,141
It happened over a year ago.

458
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,935
Now, I assume that you've done

459
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:58,354
your own scans of Odo
over the years.

460
00:23:58,354 --> 00:23:59,479
Of course.

461
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,315
Then why do you need ours?

462
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:04,777
To use as a point of comparison
in hopes of finding a cure, sir.

463
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:05,903
A cure?

464
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:07,445
That's right.

465
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:13,077
Is there anything else, sir?

466
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:15,704
No. No, that pretty much
covers it.

467
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,582
Good. So, um,
when can I expect to receive

468
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,000
a copy of these files?

469
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,502
I'm afraid
those files are classified.

470
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:25,381
But... I thought
you just asked me

471
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:26,715
all these questions in order

472
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,466
to clear me
to receive them.

473
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:29,509
No, no, you misunderstood.

474
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,178
I can't release those files

475
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:33,013
to anyone that doesn't have
Sigma Nine Clearance.

476
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:37,475
Listen, I don't give a damn
about Sigma Nine Clearance!

477
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:38,852
All I care about
is finding a cure

478
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,104
for this disease!

479
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:41,814
I fail to see
why you're so determined

480
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:44,108
to cure a disease
that infects our enemy.

481
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:45,567
We're at war, Doctor.

482
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,861
The Founders have nothing
to do with it.

483
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,322
Odo's life is at stake!

484
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:50,864
Odo, who by your own admission

485
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,950
has been known to consort
with the enemy.

486
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:57,830
Sir, you have to understand
the circumstances.

487
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,082
I don't care
about the circumstances.

488
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,750
If you find a cure

489
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,669
there's a good chance
it'll fall into Dominion hands.

490
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:06,213
That's a risk that Starfleet
Medical is not willing to take.

491
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:09,049
Request for the files is denied.

492
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,760
Now, if I were you,
I would drop this matter.

493
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,096
Otherwise, I'll have to refer it
to Starfleet Security.

494
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:21,519
(<i> sighs</i> )

495
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,485
Sounds like a typical bureaucrat
flexing his muscles.

496
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:28,944
No, it was more than that.

497
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,737
He practically accused me
of being a traitor.

498
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,906
Made it sound like I was
in league with the Dominion

499
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,658
just because I
wanted to help Odo.

500
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:37,119
Maybe the attack on Starfleet
Headquarters has him spooked.

501
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,745
You know, guys like Hilliard

502
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,998
are used to sitting behind
their desks, not under them.

503
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:45,294
If only I could get ahold
of that file.

504
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:47,213
Maybe the Captain
can request it.

505
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:49,507
Well, does he have Sigma Nine
Clearance, whatever that is?

506
00:25:49,507 --> 00:25:52,385
For Odo's sake,
we better hope so.

507
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,881
Welcome to the headquarters

508
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:33,259
of the Cardassian
Liberation Front.

509
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:36,303
It's been a long time.

510
00:26:37,555 --> 00:26:39,223
Yes, it has.

511
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:41,350
Did you bring the
supplies we requested?

512
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,600
Food replicators

513
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,270
weapons...

514
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,729
I think you'll find
everything you've asked for.

515
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:46,897
Excellent.

516
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:48,399
The Cardassian people

517
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:50,859
won't forget
the Federation's generosity.

518
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,278
GARAK:
How nice.

519
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:54,363
And now that the formalities
are over with

520
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:56,782
let's try to remember
that our enemy

521
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:59,743
is the Dominion
and not each other.

522
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:04,415
I don't need to be reminded
who my enemies are.

523
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:14,632
A resistance organization
is structured into cells--

524
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:17,511
autonomous groups
of ten or 20 people.

525
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,637
That way, if anyone
gets captured

526
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:20,847
their ability to compromise

527
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:23,350
the entire organization
is limited.

528
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,852
They can't be forced to name
names that they don't know.

529
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:28,272
The Obsidian Order
worked the same way.

530
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:29,898
KIRA:
We have to
decentralize

531
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,358
your operation.

532
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,486
Having all your men
in one place is just too risky.

533
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:34,987
If we scatter our resources

534
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:37,281
we won't be able
to defend ourselves

535
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:38,907
against a
Dominion assault.

536
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,076
KIRA:
And if you stay
in one place

537
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,578
they can wipe out

538
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:45,038
your entire resistance movement
in one attack.

539
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:47,458
Smaller groups are safer.

540
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:49,460
They're harder to track down.

541
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:52,171
I'll have my men investigate
possible locations

542
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:53,464
for other bases.

543
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:54,756
Good.

544
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,383
Now, Odo and Garak

545
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,385
have been looking over
your intelligence reports

546
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,970
and they came up with a list
of vulnerable facilities

547
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:02,306
for us to target.

548
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:04,682
The weapons depot
on Adarak Prime

549
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:07,144
is protected by only a single
garrison and there's

550
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:10,105
a weakness in their
perimeter defenses.

551
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:13,233
A small group could infiltrate
the compound and disable...

552
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,360
CARDASSIAN:
Adarak Prime
is defended

553
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,529
by a Cardassian garrison.

554
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:18,614
That's correct.

555
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,282
You expect us to attack
our own people?

556
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:22,784
If necessary, yes.

557
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,911
That's out of the question.

558
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,580
I agree.

559
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,291
We'll limit ourselves
to targets defended

560
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:31,084
by the Jem'Hadar
and the Breen.

561
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:34,505
Well, believe me,
I understand how you feel.

562
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:35,839
During the occupation

563
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,592
I didn't want to attack
any facility

564
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:40,844
that had a Bajoran
working in it, but I did it

565
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,347
because they
were collaborators.

566
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:45,474
They were working
with the enemy.

567
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:48,352
We're not Bajorans.

568
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:50,688
We don't kill our own.

569
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:53,773
Well, then, you might as well
just give up right now

570
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:56,735
because the minute
that the Dominion realizes

571
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,445
that you will not attack
your own people

572
00:28:58,445 --> 00:28:59,655
they will station

573
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:01,948
a Cardassian
at every base they have.

574
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,617
She's right.

575
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:06,286
The Founders won't hesitate
to play your own people

576
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,454
against you.

577
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,915
Anyone who is not
fighting with you

578
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:12,125
is fighting against you.

579
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:19,049
You were saying

580
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:21,843
the Adarak perimeter
defenses are vulnerable.

581
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:22,886
Damar!

582
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,638
Not another word, Rusot.

583
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:27,974
Continue.

584
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:29,768
We would need to disable

585
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,937
the garrison's
security protocols.

586
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:34,648
I believe
that's where I step in.

587
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:40,946
BASHIR:
I'd love to have seen
Hilliard's face

588
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,573
when he realized
Captain Sisko

589
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:43,741
had Sigma Nine Clearance.

590
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:47,745
So... is the file worth

591
00:29:47,745 --> 00:29:49,079
all the trouble
you had to go through?

592
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,581
There's more data here
than I expected.

593
00:29:50,581 --> 00:29:53,584
Starfleet Medical
certainly were thorough.

594
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:55,377
Oh, by the way...

595
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:57,379
what happened with you and Ezri?

596
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:00,173
Don't ask.

597
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,467
Go on.

598
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:04,219
Actually,
she got involved with Worf.

599
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,471
What?

600
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:06,846
She told you that?

601
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,766
Well, not in so many words.

602
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:11,518
Julian...

603
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,771
I had a drink with Worf
the other day.

604
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:16,356
He told me that he and Ezri
were just friends.

605
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,609
You must have
misunderstood her.

606
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:21,695
I suppose it's possible.

607
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:23,113
I mean, she didn't exactly
come out and say it.

608
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:24,490
Well, did you
at least

609
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,533
find out why she's
been avoiding you?

610
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:27,743
No.

611
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,495
(<i> console beeping</i> )

612
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:32,080
That's odd.

613
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,332
What?

614
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:34,874
The dispersal pattern

615
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:37,085
in this resonance scan...
I've seen it before.

616
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,545
O'BRIEN:
What do you mean?

617
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,297
When I first came
to the station

618
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:42,549
I had to familiarize myself
with Odo's physiology.

619
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:45,594
Dr. Mora was kind enough
to share his data with me.

620
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:47,053
This looks like the scan

621
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:49,598
he did when he first found Odo.

622
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:51,308
Are you sure?

623
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:52,851
There's a lot
of numbers there.

624
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,978
I saw it with my own eyes
not seven years ago.

625
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,438
Huh. You really<i> are</i>

626
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:57,564
genetically enhanced,
aren't you?

627
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,232
According to the date

628
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,610
this scan was done when Odo
was at Starfleet Medical.

629
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,737
Two different scans
can't have

630
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:05,656
exactly the same
dispersal patterns?

631
00:31:05,656 --> 00:31:07,700
It's impossible.

632
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,785
Someone took Dr. Mora's
results and built up

633
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:11,662
a phony medical
workup around them.

634
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:14,998
This isn't Odo's file.

635
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,458
They sent a fake.

636
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,837
Oh, I can't believe
Starfleet Medical

637
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:22,255
would actually
make up a fake file

638
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,382
just to throw you off.

639
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:25,091
You're right.

640
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:29,304
It isn't something
Starfleet<i> Medical</i> would do.

641
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,223
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

642
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:32,766
Section 31.

643
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:34,852
An organization that's prepared

644
00:31:34,852 --> 00:31:37,771
to do whatever it takes
to "protect" the Federation

645
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:40,315
wouldn't even blink
at doing something like this.

646
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,568
They don't want me
to find a cure.

647
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:45,696
They're afraid the Founders
will get hold of it.

648
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:48,031
And to keep that
from happening...

649
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,075
they're willing to let Odo die.

650
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:58,083
MARTOK:
First he gives me a medal,
then he takes over my command.

651
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,752
It makes no sense.

652
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:01,961
WORF:
Our people have
come to see you

653
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,422
as a savior of the Empire.

654
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:05,632
That is something
Gowron cannot tolerate.

655
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,676
<i>He</i> wants to be its savior.

656
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,177
What's he afraid of?

657
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,430
That I'm going
to challenge his position?

658
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,014
I have no interest in politics.

659
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,683
I'm a soldier.

660
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:18,270
By the hand of Kahless...

661
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,897
I've<i> earned</i>

662
00:32:19,897 --> 00:32:21,565
my position.

663
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:23,233
I've risen through the ranks,
fought countless battles

664
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:24,818
and what has he done?

665
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:28,280
Schemed and plotted
his way to power.

666
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,699
His military experience
is limited.

667
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:33,076
He is not
half the tactician you are.

668
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:37,790
Many brave warriors have given
their lives in this war.

669
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:43,629
(<i> sighs deeply</i> )

670
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:49,843
Whatever Gowron's motives are,
it is our duty to help him

671
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:51,762
defeat the Dominion.

672
00:32:51,762 --> 00:32:54,514
We owe it
to our fallen comrades.

673
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:59,686
I am honored
to be part of your House.

674
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:02,314
Hmm...

675
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:03,607
Well...

676
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:09,613
I had better gather my things.

677
00:33:11,782 --> 00:33:14,743
This office belongs
to Gowron now.

678
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:27,840
How's the food?

679
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,633
Replicated.

680
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:32,845
Are you going
to ask him or not?

681
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:34,638
I wouldn't
recommend it.

682
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:36,640
It's a legitimate

683
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,724
question, Garak.

684
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,058
GARAK:
Maybe I just don't think

685
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:40,894
it's a proper subject
for discussion

686
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:43,355
<i>not</i> if we're all supposed
to be getting along.

687
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:48,777
Well, if you won't
ask him, I will.

688
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:50,570
Odo.

689
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:57,870
When you were the Head
of Security on Terok Nor

690
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:00,413
what did you think
was going to happen

691
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:03,458
to the Bajoran
prisoners you arrested?

692
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,002
You don't have
to answer that.

693
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:06,670
Why not?

694
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,129
It's a legitimate question.

695
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,215
Only if you want to
provoke an argument.

696
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:12,009
Just as I said.

697
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:13,552
ODO:
I<i> expected</i>

698
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:17,597
that my prisoners would
be dealt with justly...

699
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:22,352
but I soon came to realize

700
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:26,147
that Cardassians have
little interest in justice.

701
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,816
Ah.

702
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:31,820
Well, then, why didn't
you resign in protest?

703
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:35,699
What are you
getting at?

704
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:37,325
Nerys, don't.

705
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,745
I believe you've
struck a nerve.

706
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:42,831
Apparently, Commander Kira
doesn't like to be reminded

707
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,541
that her lover collaborated

708
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:45,584
with her enemies.

709
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,002
Odo wasn't a collaborator.

710
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:50,463
I suppose that depends
on your definition

711
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:51,631
of collaborator.

712
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:52,591
Nerys...

713
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:53,884
it isn't worth it.

714
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:56,595
Odo's right,
Commander.

715
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:00,390
I guess we have
a difference of opinion.

716
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,856
You don't know
how lucky you are.

717
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:09,066
Oh? Why is that?

718
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:10,483
She would have
killed you.

719
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:14,071
I only wish she had tried.

720
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:18,658
(<i> clattering loudly</i> )

721
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:26,917
Well, I'm glad
we're in agreement.

722
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:29,586
If you want to knock over
some supplies, be my guest.

723
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:32,338
You did the right thing, Nerys.

724
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:33,465
The Dominion is our enemy

725
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:34,758
not Rusot.

726
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:36,384
I don't need you
to remind me of that!

727
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:39,763
Oh...

728
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:42,265
I'm sorry. I'm...

729
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,434
I'm sorry.

730
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,815
It's just, uh...

731
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:52,400
it's just so hot in here.

732
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,986
Well...

733
00:35:53,986 --> 00:35:55,654
the Cardassians
do love the heat.

734
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:57,280
I don't.

735
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,826
I'm going to go see
if I can find a cooling unit.

736
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:02,577
I'll come with you.

737
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,370
It's all right.

738
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:07,290
I promise I won't
hit anyone.

739
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,417
I'll hold you to that.

740
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:37,487
Now, you're not going
to believe this.

741
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:38,947
Believe what?

742
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:42,075
Damar actually had a cooling
unit waiting for us.

743
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,539
(<i> sighing</i> )

744
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:50,917
What's wrong?

745
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,502
Nothing.

746
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:54,004
I was just worried

747
00:36:54,004 --> 00:36:56,422
that you might have had
another run-in with Rusot.

748
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:57,716
Don't worry.

749
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,718
I'm going to keep a cool head.

750
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:03,262
Assuming, of course,
I can get this thing to work.

751
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,443
Adami...

752
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:19,362
are you there?

753
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,750
I'm here.

754
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:34,794
I spoke with the doctor.

755
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:38,548
She says she can find
nothing wrong with your eyes.

756
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:40,550
Then she's incompetent.

757
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:43,595
A Cardassian doctor
would have cured me by now.

758
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:46,431
You still don't understand,
do you?

759
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:49,768
The Pah-wraiths
have taken your sight

760
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:52,478
in punishment
for your arrogance.

761
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:54,606
Only they can
give it back to you.

762
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:57,567
I meant them no disrespect.

763
00:37:57,567 --> 00:37:59,819
I only wanted to study the book

764
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:03,322
to see if I could help you learn
how to release them.

765
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:06,367
You wanted to see
if you could do it without me.

766
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:09,913
Well, you can't.

767
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:12,373
Pray with me, Adami.

768
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:17,587
Help me earn
the Pah-wraiths' forgiveness.

769
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:20,339
I'm afraid you'll have
to do that on your own.

770
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:21,382
Door.

771
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:27,346
Deputy Bodan
will show you out.

772
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:31,476
"Show me out..."
I don't understand.

773
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:34,813
Well, you need a
lesson in humility.

774
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:37,690
I'm going to see
that you get it.

775
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,443
By putting me out
on the street?

776
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:43,404
You'll find the Bajoran people
are very kind.

777
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:45,240
A blind beggar
will elicit

778
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,659
their sympathies,
I'm certain

779
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:51,037
and with any luck, you'll earn
enough to eat, and perhaps

780
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:53,581
even enough for
shelter each night.

781
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,374
You're not...

782
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:56,501
you're not serious?

783
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,794
You may return

784
00:38:57,794 --> 00:38:59,754
when you've
proven yourself worthy

785
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:03,549
and your sight
has been restored.

786
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:05,302
Bodan.

787
00:39:05,302 --> 00:39:07,929
Adami, lis...

788
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:10,473
Adami...

789
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,517
Adami, listen
to me, please!

790
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:13,935
Adami!

791
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:15,770
(<i> door closes</i> )

792
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:23,569
You see?

793
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:24,654
(<i> door chimes</i> )

794
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:26,239
Enter.

795
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,406
(<i> door opens</i> )

796
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:28,950
Come in, come in.

797
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,541
I've been studying
the strategic situation.

798
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:39,502
I want to share my
thoughts with you.

799
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:40,837
Of course.

800
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:42,839
Come.

801
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:45,091
The Dominion is deploying

802
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:48,427
its fleet in preparation
for a final offensive.

803
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:51,556
They're destroying
our ships one by one.

804
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:54,142
We must hold the line
until the Federation

805
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:55,894
and Romulan fleets
become operational again.

806
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:58,146
No, don't you see?

807
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,982
That's exactly what the enemy
is expecting.

808
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:03,401
The time to act is now.

809
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,195
What are you proposing,
Chancellor?

810
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:07,197
We're going on the offensive.

811
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:09,532
Starting tomorrow,
I'm sending sorties

812
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,492
deep into enemy territory

813
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:14,746
to strike at the very heart
of the Dominion.

814
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:17,665
But we are barely
holding the line as it is.

815
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:20,252
We need every ship we have
to defend the border.

816
00:40:20,252 --> 00:40:22,170
What's wrong with you two?

817
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,630
Don't you understand?
We must seize the day!

818
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:27,092
We are outnumbered 20 to one.

819
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:28,467
What of it?

820
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:30,511
The element of surprise
will be on our side.

821
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:33,139
Chancellor,
in my opinion...

822
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,891
Did I ask your opinion?

823
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,811
Trust me, my friends.

824
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:42,523
I can see it all so clearly.

825
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:45,318
While our allies sit
and do nothing

826
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:49,906
the Klingon Empire
will score the final triumph

827
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:51,408
over the Dominion.

828
00:40:51,408 --> 00:40:53,576
We'll be the saviors
of the Alpha Quadrant.

829
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:55,828
The glory will be ours...

830
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,623
and ours alone.

831
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:11,761
I don't know, Julian.

832
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:14,347
If Section 31
<i>is</i> involved with this

833
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:15,890
maybe we should
tell the Captain.

834
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,767
We've been over this, Miles.

835
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:20,979
If we tell him, he'll<i> have</i> to
report it to Starfleet Command.

836
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:22,814
31 will certainly
get wind of it

837
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,941
and once they realize we've
figured out the files are fake

838
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:27,860
they'll take steps to make
sure we don't find a cure.

839
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,029
Hmm. I see your point.

840
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,199
What steps do you think
they might take?

841
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,994
Believe me, we don't
want to find out.

842
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,620
(<i> door opening</i> )

843
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,497
Excuse me, gentlemen.

844
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,667
Is that coffee?

845
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:46,879
I figured you were
probably working on
a way to help Odo.

846
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:50,175
I thought... this is
the least I can do.

847
00:41:50,175 --> 00:41:51,676
How did you know Odo was ill?

848
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:53,552
I hear things.

849
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:55,388
Yeah, well, keep it
under your hat, will you?

850
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:56,389
Why?

851
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:57,723
Just do it.

852
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:59,558
All right.

853
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:01,436
All right, do you
still want the coffee?

854
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:03,562
Odo would be touched
if he knew you were doing this.

855
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:06,941
You're not going
to tell him, are you?

856
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,609
It'll be our little secret.

857
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,322
Good luck.

858
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:22,374
Here you go.

859
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:24,083
Hang on, hang on.

860
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,836
I'm... just trying to figure out
when Odo became infected.

861
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:28,421
I analyzed
the sample he left

862
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:30,173
and mapped out the life
cycle of the virus

863
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:32,842
and programmed the computer to
calculate just how long it took

864
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:34,677
for the virus to reach
its present level

865
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:35,928
of concentration.

866
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,055
Well, that makes sense.

867
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,560
Well, according
to that

868
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,521
he was infected
over two years ago?

869
00:42:44,521 --> 00:42:46,314
More than that.

870
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:48,316
I just don't understand.

871
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:49,775
I assumed he became infected

872
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:52,404
when he linked
with the female shape-shifter.

873
00:42:52,404 --> 00:42:53,988
But if it happened
that long ago

874
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,740
how come he's never shown
any symptoms before?

875
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:56,949
Good question.

876
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,368
(<i> console beeping</i> )

877
00:42:58,368 --> 00:42:59,369
Got it.

878
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:01,829
Stardate 49419.

879
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,748
Almost<i> three</i> years ago.

880
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:05,708
Wait a minute.

881
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:07,377
49419...

882
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:13,132
That's the<i> day</i> that Odo
was at Starfleet Medical.

883
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,133
Are you sure?

884
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,843
<i>Yes.</i>

885
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:20,223
My God, no wonder Hilliard
wouldn't let me see the file.

886
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:22,892
Section 31 must have created
the virus, infected Odo

887
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:25,853
and then used him
as a carrier.

888
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,813
So that when he linked
with another changeling

889
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:29,441
he'd pass it on.

890
00:43:29,441 --> 00:43:31,609
Eventually, the entire
race would be infected.

891
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:35,280
31 isn't just trying to stop
us from finding a cure.

892
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,781
They're trying to
cover up the fact

893
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:38,491
that they set out
to commit genocide.

894
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:40,993
Well, if they<i> gave</i> 
Odo this disease

895
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,412
then they must
have a cure.

896
00:43:42,412 --> 00:43:43,538
We have to find a way

897
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:45,331
to get our hands
on that cure.

898
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:49,001
Huh... before 31 gets
their hands on us.
