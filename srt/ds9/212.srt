1
00:00:03,197 --> 00:00:05,030
I am merely a businessman.

2
00:00:05,067 --> 00:00:06,627
It would take an orator

3
00:00:06,671 --> 00:00:09,939
with the skills of the late,
great Plegg himself

4
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:13,006
to sing the praises
of the late, great Plegg.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,920
What Ferengi could resist
the honor of owning

6
00:00:15,956 --> 00:00:19,190
a small piece of the man
that took a computer chip

7
00:00:19,229 --> 00:00:22,463
and turned it into
the modular holosuite industry?

8
00:00:22,502 --> 00:00:24,062
A small piece of the man

9
00:00:24,105 --> 00:00:26,541
that brought
holographic entertainment

10
00:00:26,577 --> 00:00:29,140
to the most remote parts
of the Quadrant

11
00:00:29,182 --> 00:00:30,742
creating profit centers

12
00:00:30,786 --> 00:00:35,022
from societies that could barely
afford to feed their own people.

13
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,586
How much are you asking?

14
00:00:36,631 --> 00:00:39,967
As I was about to tell
my good friend here

15
00:00:40,004 --> 00:00:42,532
a mere three strips of latinum.

16
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:44,739
And I'd be taking
a loss at that price.

17
00:00:47,518 --> 00:00:50,217
Okay, for you, two strips.

18
00:00:53,163 --> 00:00:55,190
Thank you very much.

19
00:00:55,234 --> 00:00:56,668
Three strips?

20
00:00:56,704 --> 00:00:58,503
That's a fair price for Plegg.

21
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,100
I suppose you're interested?

22
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:02,741
Humanoid death rituals
are an interest of mine.

23
00:01:02,783 --> 00:01:03,876
Death rituals.

24
00:01:03,918 --> 00:01:05,478
Everybody needs a hobby.

25
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:06,614
Mm-hmm.

26
00:01:06,657 --> 00:01:08,593
Some species burn their dead

27
00:01:08,628 --> 00:01:10,860
others pack them
in blocks of ice.

28
00:01:10,899 --> 00:01:12,892
Some even surround themselves

29
00:01:12,936 --> 00:01:15,202
with the company
of family corpses.

30
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:19,238
But the Ferengi ritual
of chopping up their loved ones

31
00:01:19,315 --> 00:01:21,717
and selling them...

32
00:01:21,754 --> 00:01:24,954
I find that irresistible.

33
00:01:24,994 --> 00:01:26,657
I'm very busy here.

34
00:01:26,697 --> 00:01:28,758
What a fitting
and distinguished way

35
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:31,534
to honor the memory
of great Ferengi entrepreneurs.

36
00:01:31,573 --> 00:01:34,204
I'm thinking of starting
a collection

37
00:01:34,245 --> 00:01:37,081
putting up a display case
in my office.

38
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:39,988
There'll be a special
space in there

39
00:01:40,024 --> 00:01:42,392
reserved just for you, Quark.

40
00:01:43,965 --> 00:01:45,662
I'm sure.

41
00:01:51,881 --> 00:01:53,680
You're serious?

42
00:01:53,718 --> 00:01:56,315
Have you ever known me
not to be?

43
00:02:03,771 --> 00:02:06,264
There is one thing
I was curious about.

44
00:02:06,309 --> 00:02:07,538
And what's that?

45
00:02:07,578 --> 00:02:09,172
How do I know it's Plegg?

46
00:02:09,215 --> 00:02:10,809
It says so on the label.

47
00:02:10,852 --> 00:02:14,018
Isn't there some
sort of letter of authenticity?

48
00:02:14,058 --> 00:02:17,292
The Ferengi Seal
of Dismemberment is right here.

49
00:02:17,398 --> 00:02:18,958
What more do you want?

50
00:02:19,002 --> 00:02:19,970
I want Plegg.

51
00:02:20,004 --> 00:02:20,972
You got him!

52
00:02:21,006 --> 00:02:22,600
Not if he's still alive.

53
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,837
Still alive?

54
00:02:24,913 --> 00:02:27,476
Still alive.

55
00:02:27,518 --> 00:02:28,645
Plegg?

56
00:02:28,688 --> 00:02:31,421
After I tracked him
down on Kholfa II

57
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:33,554
told him
about your little scheme

58
00:02:33,597 --> 00:02:34,929
he was quite amused.

59
00:02:34,967 --> 00:02:36,435
I'm not.

60
00:02:36,469 --> 00:02:38,268
Odo, I'm a victim here.

61
00:02:38,306 --> 00:02:41,039
I bought these discs
in good faith.

62
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:44,574
I have 5,000 pieces of Plegg
in my storeroom.

63
00:02:44,619 --> 00:02:46,213
Uh-uh-uh, not Plegg.

64
00:02:46,256 --> 00:02:47,349
Then who?

65
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,021
Good question.

66
00:02:50,064 --> 00:02:52,296
I demand an investigation.

67
00:02:52,334 --> 00:02:54,827
You'll get one, I promise you.

68
00:02:54,873 --> 00:02:56,866
Odo!

69
00:02:58,915 --> 00:03:00,714
Dr. Mora.

70
00:03:02,388 --> 00:03:05,827
It's been too long.

71
00:03:05,862 --> 00:03:07,695
You're looking well.

72
00:03:09,202 --> 00:03:10,636
Yes...

73
00:03:10,671 --> 00:03:12,971
coming along nicely.

74
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,877
Why didn't you let me know
that you were coming?

75
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:20,014
It was a last-minute
arrangement.

76
00:03:20,057 --> 00:03:23,359
Uh-huh. The trip from Bajor
takes five hours.

77
00:03:23,463 --> 00:03:26,765
Can I get you something...
Dr., uh, Mora, was it?

78
00:03:26,804 --> 00:03:31,006
Yes, some, uh, Deka tea
would be nice.

79
00:03:37,525 --> 00:03:40,053
Haven't quite managed
the ears yet, have you?

80
00:03:40,097 --> 00:03:41,760
Oh, no, but they're...

81
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:43,167
they're difficult.

82
00:03:43,203 --> 00:03:45,002
Is the suit a suit,
or part of you?

83
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,566
Oh, and what about the boots?

84
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:47,770
Here we are.

85
00:03:47,813 --> 00:03:49,111
Nice and hot.

86
00:03:49,148 --> 00:03:50,548
Thank you.

87
00:03:50,584 --> 00:03:51,916
So, um...

88
00:03:51,954 --> 00:03:54,015
you two seem to be old friends.

89
00:03:54,058 --> 00:03:56,051
Dr. Mora is
the Bajoran scientist

90
00:03:56,095 --> 00:03:58,565
who was assigned to
me after I was found.

91
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,572
I was personally responsible
for his development

92
00:04:01,606 --> 00:04:03,200
during his formative years.

93
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,338
So, this is a family reunion.

94
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,643
I had a hunch.

95
00:04:06,683 --> 00:04:09,712
Well, Odo's dad is
always welcome at Quark's.

96
00:04:09,756 --> 00:04:11,019
- He is not...
- Actually...

97
00:04:11,059 --> 00:04:12,926
I know he wouldn't
tell you himself

98
00:04:12,963 --> 00:04:15,160
but Odo is doing a wonderful job
here on the station

99
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,691
- if I may say so.
- Is he?

100
00:04:16,736 --> 00:04:18,831
Absolutely.
As a matter of fact

101
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,676
when you came in, he was just
beginning a fraud investigation.

102
00:04:21,713 --> 00:04:23,307
Quark!

103
00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:26,712
Excuse us.

104
00:04:26,756 --> 00:04:28,224
Of course.

105
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:31,791
The two of you have
a lot of catching up to do.

106
00:04:31,834 --> 00:04:35,399
If there's anything
I can help you with, Doctor

107
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,672
don't hesitate to call on me.

108
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:39,111
That was uncalled-for.

109
00:04:39,148 --> 00:04:40,742
Huh! You don't know Quark.

110
00:04:40,785 --> 00:04:43,313
I know that he was
trying to present you

111
00:04:43,356 --> 00:04:45,349
in as positive a light
as possible

112
00:04:45,394 --> 00:04:48,059
to someone he thought
was important to you.

113
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:49,728
And you responded with...

114
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:50,998
Please!

115
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:53,943
Still having trouble
with social integration.

116
00:04:53,978 --> 00:04:56,073
I integrate as much
as I want to.

117
00:04:56,115 --> 00:04:58,017
Define "as much as I want to."

118
00:04:58,053 --> 00:05:03,588
"As much as I want to"
means as much as I want to.

119
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,121
Hmm.

120
00:05:05,167 --> 00:05:08,264
Quark is a thief, a con man...

121
00:05:08,306 --> 00:05:11,301
nobody you want to know.

122
00:05:13,183 --> 00:05:16,121
So, um, tell me about
this police thing

123
00:05:16,155 --> 00:05:18,922
you've gotten yourself
involved with.

124
00:05:18,961 --> 00:05:20,361
Is it working out?

125
00:05:20,397 --> 00:05:23,858
I enjoy my work
as Chief of Security.

126
00:05:23,904 --> 00:05:25,464
Chief of Security

127
00:05:25,574 --> 00:05:28,478
at a way station in space.

128
00:05:28,513 --> 00:05:30,949
Don't you miss it, Odo?

129
00:05:30,985 --> 00:05:32,283
What?

130
00:05:32,321 --> 00:05:34,723
Our work.

131
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:36,057
Never.

132
00:05:36,095 --> 00:05:37,826
I don't believe it.

133
00:05:37,866 --> 00:05:39,733
I know you too well.

134
00:05:39,769 --> 00:05:41,932
You were unhappy in the lab.

135
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:44,103
I can't blame you for that.

136
00:05:44,145 --> 00:05:46,342
But the work, Odo, the work.

137
00:05:46,382 --> 00:05:48,181
The exploration of you

138
00:05:48,219 --> 00:05:51,282
what you are,
where you came from.

139
00:05:51,325 --> 00:05:54,058
That's never far
from your mind, is it?

140
00:05:54,098 --> 00:05:58,471
That part of it... is true.

141
00:05:58,506 --> 00:05:59,531
Good.

142
00:05:59,642 --> 00:06:02,375
Because I came here
counting on that.

143
00:08:11,462 --> 00:08:12,953
See you later, Dad.

144
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:14,525
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hold on!

145
00:08:14,568 --> 00:08:15,536
I'm late.

146
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:16,538
For what?

147
00:08:16,572 --> 00:08:17,540
For Nog.

148
00:08:17,574 --> 00:08:19,042
- Your homework.
- It's done.

149
00:08:19,078 --> 00:08:20,512
You studied that
entire Klingon opera

150
00:08:20,547 --> 00:08:21,674
for the music test on Friday?

151
00:08:21,716 --> 00:08:24,279
I'm going to ace the test,
Dad, I promise.

152
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:25,550
This isn't about tests, Jake.

153
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,580
This is about learning.

154
00:08:26,626 --> 00:08:28,459
You can't learn to
appreciate Klingon opera

155
00:08:28,496 --> 00:08:30,295
by cramming for the exam
the night before.

156
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,565
What am I ever going to use
Klingon opera for?

157
00:08:32,604 --> 00:08:35,599
Well...

158
00:08:35,644 --> 00:08:36,976
first of all

159
00:08:37,013 --> 00:08:39,814
you don't know what you're
going to be when you grow up.

160
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:43,291
You may discover along the way
that you want to be a musician

161
00:08:43,326 --> 00:08:48,098
or you may find yourself
among some Klingons...

162
00:08:48,136 --> 00:08:51,108
in a job... somewhere.

163
00:08:51,142 --> 00:08:52,474
Dad, even if I did

164
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:54,674
they wouldn't be going
around singing operas.

165
00:08:54,715 --> 00:08:56,651
It helps you understand
their culture.

166
00:08:56,686 --> 00:08:59,020
When was the last time you
listened to Klingon opera?

167
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,592
When I was your age.

168
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:03,462
There, you see?

169
00:09:03,499 --> 00:09:04,524
Yes. Do you?

170
00:09:04,568 --> 00:09:07,597
Just because you suffered
through all that

171
00:09:07,641 --> 00:09:09,338
doesn't mean I have to.

172
00:09:09,378 --> 00:09:11,712
Yes, it does.

173
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:13,944
Come in.

174
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:15,080
Dad!

175
00:09:15,123 --> 00:09:17,457
I have the perfect solution.

176
00:09:17,494 --> 00:09:18,462
Nog has the same test.

177
00:09:18,496 --> 00:09:19,794
Why don't you invite him over

178
00:09:19,832 --> 00:09:21,995
and you can listen
to the Klingon opera together?

179
00:09:25,343 --> 00:09:26,972
Please, Odo, sit down.

180
00:09:32,891 --> 00:09:36,888
Commander, I'd like to request
the use of a runabout.

181
00:09:36,933 --> 00:09:38,459
Of course.
For what?

182
00:09:38,503 --> 00:09:39,903
Dr. Mora Pol

183
00:09:39,972 --> 00:09:42,705
from the Bajoran Institute
of Science has asked me

184
00:09:42,744 --> 00:09:45,112
to help him secure
one from the Federation.

185
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,584
Why did he come to you?

186
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:49,750
Dr. Mora is the scientist
who was assigned to me

187
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:51,318
in my first years here.

188
00:09:51,362 --> 00:09:53,696
If he went
to the Board of Ministers

189
00:09:53,733 --> 00:09:56,169
to request permission
to approach you

190
00:09:56,205 --> 00:09:57,434
it would take months.

191
00:09:57,474 --> 00:09:59,410
And he's very anxious
to investigate

192
00:09:59,445 --> 00:10:01,745
something in the Gamma Quadrant.

193
00:10:01,782 --> 00:10:04,345
And, may I say,
Commander, so am I.

194
00:10:04,388 --> 00:10:07,087
You've gotten me curious,
Constable.

195
00:10:07,127 --> 00:10:08,288
Is it a secret?

196
00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:10,960
No, but there isn't
much to tell.

197
00:10:11,001 --> 00:10:13,632
One of the Bajoran
science probes

198
00:10:13,673 --> 00:10:15,734
recently scanned a planet

199
00:10:15,777 --> 00:10:18,977
about six light-years
from the wormhole.

200
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:22,683
It picked up some very
unique... and familiar...

201
00:10:22,724 --> 00:10:23,987
DNA patterns

202
00:10:24,093 --> 00:10:26,963
patterns very much
like my own, Commander.

203
00:10:26,999 --> 00:10:29,435
Dr. Mora thinks
he may have discovered

204
00:10:29,471 --> 00:10:32,466
the origin of my people...

205
00:10:32,511 --> 00:10:34,378
of me.

206
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:46,997
It would seem to me

207
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:49,532
that being a scientist
yourself, Lieutenant

208
00:10:49,578 --> 00:10:52,311
you can appreciate
the difficulty of our dilemma

209
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,015
and the elegance
of the solution.

210
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:57,048
When Odo was first found

211
00:10:57,126 --> 00:10:59,187
nobody knew who...
or, indeed, what...

212
00:10:59,231 --> 00:11:01,201
it was we were dealing with.

213
00:11:01,235 --> 00:11:03,671
A shapeless,
viscous mass of fluid

214
00:11:03,706 --> 00:11:05,642
a veritable organic broth.

215
00:11:05,677 --> 00:11:07,613
That was our Odo
in the beginning.

216
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,876
When did you realize

217
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:11,479
you were dealing with
a sentient life-form?

218
00:11:11,522 --> 00:11:12,581
He didn't.

219
00:11:12,624 --> 00:11:15,721
I had to teach him that myself.

220
00:11:15,763 --> 00:11:18,735
It's true.
It's very true.

221
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:19,896
Tell her.

222
00:11:19,938 --> 00:11:21,464
It was a dilemma for me.

223
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:24,948
I had never seen anything
like these creatures either.

224
00:11:24,982 --> 00:11:27,749
"Seen" isn't really
an appropriate description.

225
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,153
He had no eyes, per se.

226
00:11:29,191 --> 00:11:32,027
I was just trying
to describe it in simple terms.

227
00:11:32,062 --> 00:11:37,562
He had never perceived
anything like us before.

228
00:11:37,607 --> 00:11:38,973
Go on.

229
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:42,471
I knew I had to find some way
to communicate with them

230
00:11:42,517 --> 00:11:44,544
so I transformed myself into...

231
00:11:44,588 --> 00:11:45,681
It was remarkable.

232
00:11:45,723 --> 00:11:48,422
Every morning
I would come into the lab

233
00:11:48,462 --> 00:11:50,455
and every morning,
Odo would be there

234
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,336
resting in his liquid form
in a Krokan petri beaker.

235
00:11:53,372 --> 00:11:55,604
One morning I walked in
and Odo was gone.

236
00:11:55,643 --> 00:11:58,342
The beaker was empty,
but next to it

237
00:11:58,382 --> 00:12:02,254
was an identical beaker
that had not been there before...

238
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:06,060
a perfect replica in every way.

239
00:12:06,164 --> 00:12:10,195
It was... amazing.

240
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,078
Oh, it hasn't been the same
since you've gone, Odo.

241
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,747
Working with you

242
00:12:17,787 --> 00:12:21,750
has been the most rewarding
part of my career.

243
00:12:21,795 --> 00:12:22,888
Hmm!

244
00:12:22,931 --> 00:12:25,401
We're approaching the planet.

245
00:12:25,436 --> 00:12:27,497
Prepare to enter standard orbit.

246
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,100
Planet designated L-S VI.

247
00:12:29,143 --> 00:12:31,636
Initiating scans.

248
00:12:31,682 --> 00:12:33,948
There's a lot
of seismic activity down there

249
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:35,956
possibly volcanic in origin.

250
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,574
Moving into synchronous orbit.

251
00:13:12,775 --> 00:13:15,211
Do the letters mean
anything to you?

252
00:13:15,246 --> 00:13:17,512
No, I don't think so.

253
00:13:17,552 --> 00:13:20,752
Judging by its position
in the ruins

254
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:21,952
I think it's fair to say

255
00:13:21,993 --> 00:13:24,361
that this pillar represented
something important

256
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,799
to the people who lived here.

257
00:13:25,835 --> 00:13:26,996
Why don't we take it with us?

258
00:13:27,037 --> 00:13:28,528
Our computers back
on the station

259
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,510
might be able to decipher
the inscriptions.

260
00:13:30,544 --> 00:13:32,070
Mm-hmm.
Where is Dr. Weld?

261
00:13:32,113 --> 00:13:33,445
Dr. Weld?

262
00:13:33,484 --> 00:13:35,420
Over here.

263
00:13:41,466 --> 00:13:45,065
I think I may have found
what we're looking for.

264
00:13:50,116 --> 00:13:51,710
Is it carbon-based?

265
00:13:51,753 --> 00:13:53,347
No, silicate

266
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:57,694
but vegetative,
and very much alive.

267
00:13:57,732 --> 00:14:00,670
Odo, Jr., perhaps.

268
00:14:13,162 --> 00:14:15,759
Computer, begin transport.

269
00:14:30,664 --> 00:14:32,361
Come on!

270
00:14:40,684 --> 00:14:42,050
Computer, realign transporter.

271
00:14:42,087 --> 00:14:43,055
Lock onto our combadges.

272
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:46,220
Stand by.

273
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:48,094
This way.

274
00:15:02,728 --> 00:15:04,789
Ready for transport.

275
00:15:04,832 --> 00:15:06,859
Computer, energize!

276
00:15:21,933 --> 00:15:23,903
They're stable for now.

277
00:15:23,937 --> 00:15:25,634
Dax is in fair condition

278
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:28,441
but the Bajorans seem to be
more seriously affected.

279
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,541
Perhaps they were exposed
to more of the gas

280
00:15:30,584 --> 00:15:32,781
or there may be something
about Trill physiology.

281
00:15:32,822 --> 00:15:34,313
I'm not sure yet.

282
00:15:34,357 --> 00:15:35,347
And Odo?

283
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:36,361
I'm fine.

284
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:37,863
The paralyzing action occurred

285
00:15:37,898 --> 00:15:40,368
when the gas was taken into
the respiratory system.

286
00:15:40,403 --> 00:15:41,666
And since Odo doesn't have

287
00:15:41,706 --> 00:15:43,300
a respiratory system
as we know it

288
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,107
he apparently wasn't
affected at all.

289
00:15:45,146 --> 00:15:47,616
O'Brien has off-loaded
the cargo they brought back.

290
00:15:47,651 --> 00:15:49,780
He has everything set up
in the science lab.

291
00:15:49,822 --> 00:15:50,881
I understand there are

292
00:15:50,924 --> 00:15:52,860
some organic specimens
from that planet.

293
00:15:52,895 --> 00:15:55,662
Maybe there's something there
to help you figure this out.

294
00:15:55,701 --> 00:15:57,033
Good idea.

295
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,801
Will he be all right?

296
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,405
The molecule appears to have
quite an unstable structure.

297
00:16:02,447 --> 00:16:04,975
That might mean
the effect is temporary.

298
00:16:21,953 --> 00:16:24,516
I know how you feel,
Constable.

299
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:27,029
Feel?
About what?

300
00:16:27,063 --> 00:16:28,794
When my father became ill

301
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:31,202
I can remember
how small and weak

302
00:16:31,238 --> 00:16:33,674
he looked there,
lying on the bed.

303
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:36,010
He'd been so strong,
so independent.

304
00:16:36,048 --> 00:16:37,482
It always seemed to me

305
00:16:37,518 --> 00:16:40,285
that there was nothing
that he couldn't do.

306
00:16:40,323 --> 00:16:42,384
But, in the end, I realized

307
00:16:42,427 --> 00:16:45,490
there was nothing
that he could do

308
00:16:45,534 --> 00:16:49,167
and nothing I could do
to help him.

309
00:16:49,207 --> 00:16:52,202
I appreciate your thoughts,
Commander

310
00:16:52,247 --> 00:16:56,654
but Dr. Mora is not my father.

311
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:09,207
The computer is
having a hard time

312
00:17:09,247 --> 00:17:11,240
classifying your new life-form.

313
00:17:11,285 --> 00:17:12,378
Why?

314
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,515
Whatever it is,
it keeps changing.

315
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:17,028
Somehow it goes through
a metamorphosis

316
00:17:17,063 --> 00:17:20,365
every time it reproduces,
and it reproduces like crazy.

317
00:17:20,403 --> 00:17:21,701
Look at this.

318
00:17:21,739 --> 00:17:24,905
It multiplied so much,
I had to change containers.

319
00:17:24,946 --> 00:17:28,977
I'll put it in a level-5
security field overnight.

320
00:17:30,423 --> 00:17:33,122
I wish Dax were here
to take a look at it.

321
00:17:33,162 --> 00:17:34,756
How's she doing?

322
00:17:34,865 --> 00:17:37,928
Dr. Bashir thinks
she'll be fine.

323
00:17:48,893 --> 00:17:51,763
Any idea what it is?

324
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:54,896
I'm hoping it's a key,
Mr. O'Brien...

325
00:17:54,939 --> 00:17:56,841
a key to my past.

326
00:18:19,722 --> 00:18:22,215
Kira to Sisko.

327
00:18:25,199 --> 00:18:27,032
Go ahead, Major.

328
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:29,040
Sorry to bother you, Commander

329
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:31,807
but we need you up here
in the Science Lab.

330
00:18:31,879 --> 00:18:33,872
I'm on my way.

331
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:38,216
...the scan, sir.

332
00:18:38,258 --> 00:18:40,694
No positive ID on the life-form.

333
00:18:42,668 --> 00:18:44,900
The holographic readout...

334
00:19:09,454 --> 00:19:11,424
Any signs of a break-in?

335
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:12,824
Not that we could find.

336
00:19:12,895 --> 00:19:14,386
The security seal on the lab

337
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:16,423
was still in place
when we got here.

338
00:19:16,468 --> 00:19:17,697
I can't imagine

339
00:19:17,738 --> 00:19:20,140
why anyone would want
to steal that thing, anyway.

340
00:19:20,176 --> 00:19:22,612
You're suggesting the life-form,
itself, did this?

341
00:19:22,647 --> 00:19:24,446
I don't know
what did this, Commander

342
00:19:24,484 --> 00:19:27,149
unless a tornado passed
this way without us hearing it.

343
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,658
The room was locked.
It's gone.

344
00:19:28,693 --> 00:19:29,451
That's all I know for now.

345
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,212
Constable, get
a level-3 security scan

346
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:32,552
underway on the entire station.

347
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:35,390
Our scanners may have trouble
finding this life-form.

348
00:19:35,428 --> 00:19:36,555
It has metamorphic qualities

349
00:19:36,597 --> 00:19:37,997
that were confusing
the computer.

350
00:19:38,034 --> 00:19:40,699
You might want to run that sweep
two or three times.

351
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,733
Let's go to Yellow Alert.

352
00:19:42,777 --> 00:19:44,838
Major, you could help
me by reviewing

353
00:19:44,881 --> 00:19:48,081
the security camera records
and the heat sensor readouts

354
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:50,318
for the lab
and the surrounding areas.

355
00:19:51,828 --> 00:19:54,732
Commander, I'm picking up
slight trace elements

356
00:19:54,768 --> 00:19:56,863
near the ventilation
intake duct.

357
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:59,468
It looks as though our life-form
may have taken this way out.

358
00:20:03,986 --> 00:20:08,051
Dr. Bashir gave you
permission to be up and about?

359
00:20:08,094 --> 00:20:09,357
Dr. Bashir wouldn't listen to me

360
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,059
and hid my clothes,
so I wouldn't leave.

361
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,363
I had to sneak out
to my quarters

362
00:20:12,469 --> 00:20:14,564
in a hospital gown
that wouldn't close in the back.

363
00:20:14,606 --> 00:20:15,767
What did this?

364
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:17,108
The working theory is

365
00:20:17,145 --> 00:20:19,513
that life-form you brought back
is somehow responsible.

366
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,611
I don't believe it.

367
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,385
Good.
Find me a better theory.

368
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,321
Odo, Dr. Mora is awake

369
00:20:27,366 --> 00:20:29,598
and would like
to speak with you.

370
00:20:47,439 --> 00:20:50,434
I heard them say
something happened in the lab.

371
00:20:50,512 --> 00:20:52,448
The life-form sample is gone.

372
00:20:52,482 --> 00:20:53,450
Gone!

373
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:55,044
We're not sure how or why yet.

374
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:56,249
I want to help.

375
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,226
Everything is under control.

376
00:20:58,261 --> 00:21:00,663
I know more about shape-shifters
than anyone in this sector.

377
00:21:00,698 --> 00:21:03,932
Anyone except me, and I'll
be running the investigation.

378
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:05,406
Besides, we're not even sure

379
00:21:05,508 --> 00:21:08,139
it is
a shape-shifting life-form.

380
00:21:08,181 --> 00:21:10,617
Any metamorphic characteristics?

381
00:21:10,652 --> 00:21:13,590
It was changing faster
than the computer could analyze.

382
00:21:13,624 --> 00:21:15,651
Any indication of intelligence?

383
00:21:15,695 --> 00:21:17,163
Not unless you consider

384
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:20,603
wanton destruction of the lab
an indication of intelligence.

385
00:21:20,638 --> 00:21:22,801
It might be.
It might be.

386
00:21:22,844 --> 00:21:26,875
Don't dismiss any possibility.

387
00:21:30,158 --> 00:21:33,653
Dr. Weld hasn't
regained consciousness.

388
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,598
I feel responsible.

389
00:21:38,641 --> 00:21:42,206
I'm sure Dr. Bashir
is doing everything possible.

390
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:04,191
The same trace elements
are inside the duct.

391
00:22:04,226 --> 00:22:06,219
I'm following the trail.

392
00:22:06,263 --> 00:22:07,960
Moving toward corridor 2-H.

393
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,801
Nothing's showing up
anywhere on the scanners, Chief.

394
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:12,365
Yeah, I figured as much.

395
00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:15,745
Did the security cameras
in the lab give you anything?

396
00:22:15,782 --> 00:22:19,347
The security cameras stopped
operating for 43 seconds

397
00:22:19,389 --> 00:22:23,090
at 03:00 hours, five minutes...
right when the alarm sounded.

398
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:25,897
Stopped? You mean,
someone turned them off.

399
00:22:25,936 --> 00:22:28,669
More likely some kind
of power interruption.

400
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:30,302
It might have affected

401
00:22:30,345 --> 00:22:32,178
the security field
around the life-form, too.

402
00:22:32,215 --> 00:22:33,513
We're trying to analyze it now.

403
00:22:33,584 --> 00:22:35,520
Do the heat sensors
in the lab show

404
00:22:35,555 --> 00:22:37,752
any thermal deviation
at the same time?

405
00:22:37,792 --> 00:22:41,493
Almost a six degree increase
during the 43 seconds.

406
00:22:41,533 --> 00:22:43,765
But then back to normal
after that?

407
00:22:43,804 --> 00:22:45,204
Affirmative.

408
00:22:45,241 --> 00:22:46,870
Oh.

409
00:22:46,911 --> 00:22:50,544
We may be dealing
with an entity that absorbs

410
00:22:50,652 --> 00:22:52,747
low-frequency R-F energy.

411
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:54,884
It might be feeding off
our power.

412
00:22:54,927 --> 00:22:58,422
But an energy drain should be
showing up on our scans.

413
00:22:58,467 --> 00:23:00,403
Yeah, that's true, Constable.

414
00:23:00,438 --> 00:23:02,203
I don't get it.

415
00:23:02,242 --> 00:23:04,678
Maybe this thermal deviation
was a result of...

416
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,379
Chief?

417
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:09,218
Hold on, I hear something.

418
00:23:09,256 --> 00:23:10,690
We've got your position.

419
00:23:10,725 --> 00:23:13,526
Nothing else is showing
up anywhere near you.

420
00:23:13,631 --> 00:23:17,332
Well, I definitely
hear something ahead.

421
00:23:19,843 --> 00:23:22,406
Can you hear it on the com line?

422
00:23:22,449 --> 00:23:24,544
No.

423
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:30,028
It almost sounds like...
I can't describe it.

424
00:23:31,533 --> 00:23:33,366
I'm moving in closer.

425
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:38,042
If you run into my wife,
don't mention I did this.

426
00:23:39,116 --> 00:23:41,679
Move some backup
to the nearest corridor.

427
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,920
Security to core section,
Level Four, corridor 2-H.

428
00:23:44,961 --> 00:23:48,901
When I come home tonight,
she'll ask me how my day was

429
00:23:48,935 --> 00:23:51,736
and I'll say, "Fine, honey.
How was yours?"

430
00:23:53,677 --> 00:23:57,242
Sometimes I don't think she
really wants to know the truth.

431
00:23:57,285 --> 00:24:00,257
So I do us both a favor, and...

432
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:01,725
Oh...

433
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,493
It's a structural breach.

434
00:24:05,601 --> 00:24:08,232
O'Brien, report.

435
00:24:09,543 --> 00:24:12,674
I'm okay. I'm fine.

436
00:24:12,715 --> 00:24:15,710
I think I found
our missing life-form.

437
00:24:20,565 --> 00:24:23,503
Except it isn't
a life-form anymore.

438
00:24:23,537 --> 00:24:25,939
It's dead.

439
00:24:25,976 --> 00:24:29,882
Station Log, Stardate 47391.7.

440
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:33,377
Engineering crews have been
working for over 15 hours

441
00:24:33,424 --> 00:24:34,722
searching conduits.

442
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:37,252
There have been
no additional incidents

443
00:24:37,298 --> 00:24:38,858
and no further evidence

444
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:41,498
of the alien life-form
has been found.

445
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,305
With this kind
of cellular structure

446
00:24:43,344 --> 00:24:46,077
the life-form would have needed
a higher concentration

447
00:24:46,116 --> 00:24:48,518
of carbon dioxide
than our atmosphere provides.

448
00:24:48,554 --> 00:24:50,751
It just couldn't survive
out of its own environment.

449
00:24:50,791 --> 00:24:52,385
Well, that would be my analysis.

450
00:24:52,428 --> 00:24:54,557
But, with that in mind,
do you still think

451
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:57,092
this life-form was capable
of destroying the lab?

452
00:24:58,107 --> 00:24:59,541
That's not impossible.

453
00:24:59,576 --> 00:25:01,136
The environmental impact

454
00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:03,547
might have taken
some time to set in.

455
00:25:03,584 --> 00:25:06,215
I'd really like to get Dr.
Mora's opinion on all of this.

456
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:07,554
Well, he's much better.

457
00:25:07,592 --> 00:25:09,391
He should be up and around
in the morning.

458
00:25:09,429 --> 00:25:12,401
Feel like getting a <i>raktajino</i>
before we call it a night?

459
00:25:12,435 --> 00:25:14,302
My replicator or yours?

460
00:25:16,109 --> 00:25:18,545
I was thinking
more of the Promenade.

461
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,243
I knew that.

462
00:25:20,284 --> 00:25:21,650
Well, thanks, anyway.

463
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:24,420
I got a few things
to wrap up around here.

464
00:25:24,459 --> 00:25:26,452
Sleep tight, Julian.

465
00:25:32,141 --> 00:25:34,441
She enjoys it.

466
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:38,681
She actually gets some kind
of perverse pleasure out of it.

467
00:25:38,754 --> 00:25:42,455
And one of these days,
I'm going to stop chasing her

468
00:25:42,495 --> 00:25:44,624
and then we'll see.

469
00:26:35,982 --> 00:26:37,781
Emergency.

470
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,619
Emergency!

471
00:26:39,657 --> 00:26:41,820
Intruder alert.

472
00:26:55,555 --> 00:26:58,025
It happened so quickly.

473
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,896
I'm sorry I can't tell you
any more about it.

474
00:27:00,932 --> 00:27:03,563
It was behind me,
and then it was gone

475
00:27:03,605 --> 00:27:06,805
but it was big, very big.

476
00:27:06,844 --> 00:27:09,611
How badly did you injure it?

477
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:11,118
I don't know.

478
00:27:11,154 --> 00:27:13,556
I don't even know
if I injured it at all.

479
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:15,925
I just hit it once
with a laser scalpel

480
00:27:15,962 --> 00:27:18,023
in the arm or the leg
or the tentacle

481
00:27:18,066 --> 00:27:19,364
or whatever it was.

482
00:27:19,436 --> 00:27:21,929
And then it went
off the wall and was gone.

483
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:24,673
It appears as though
our life-form has survived

484
00:27:24,713 --> 00:27:26,808
and grown into something
interesting.

485
00:27:26,851 --> 00:27:28,149
Did you notice anything

486
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,124
when you entered
the room, Doctor?

487
00:27:30,158 --> 00:27:32,492
Anything out of place,
anything unusual?

488
00:27:35,335 --> 00:27:38,034
Was it unusually warm, perhaps?

489
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:42,036
Now that you come to mention it,
it was a bit warm in here.

490
00:27:42,081 --> 00:27:44,574
Another thermal distortion.

491
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,590
Did you try the lights, Doctor?

492
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:49,619
No, I didn't want
to disturb the patients.

493
00:27:49,663 --> 00:27:51,223
Commander, I suggest we check

494
00:27:51,267 --> 00:27:53,237
the R-F energy flow
to the Infirmary.

495
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:55,104
We might find
a power interruption

496
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,301
as we did in the lab.

497
00:27:56,344 --> 00:27:58,109
No blood or any fluid traces

498
00:27:58,146 --> 00:28:00,309
but I am picking up
a very slight trail of something

499
00:28:00,352 --> 00:28:02,219
we didn't see last time...
an organic residue.

500
00:28:02,256 --> 00:28:03,224
Enough to test?

501
00:28:03,258 --> 00:28:04,226
We'll see.

502
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,228
Sisko to Ops.

503
00:28:05,262 --> 00:28:06,389
Go ahead.

504
00:28:06,464 --> 00:28:09,197
Restrict all nonessential
personnel to their quarters

505
00:28:09,236 --> 00:28:10,636
and go to Red Alert, Major.

506
00:28:10,672 --> 00:28:11,697
Understood.

507
00:28:11,741 --> 00:28:13,232
Keep in touch
with Dax's progress.

508
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:15,214
She may give us a way
to track this thing.

509
00:28:15,282 --> 00:28:18,584
Until we can, I suggest
we close down the Promenade.

510
00:28:18,621 --> 00:28:20,614
I'll give the order, Constable.

511
00:28:21,627 --> 00:28:22,925
"Constable"?

512
00:28:22,963 --> 00:28:25,628
It's a nickname
that I barely tolerate.

513
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:27,935
It's an expression of affection

514
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:30,307
that you find
difficult to accept.

515
00:28:39,162 --> 00:28:42,328
You know, that was
a remarkable display back there.

516
00:28:42,369 --> 00:28:43,462
Display?

517
00:28:43,504 --> 00:28:45,974
Yes, you were very careful,
attentive.

518
00:28:46,009 --> 00:28:47,638
I was just doing my job.

519
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,149
I begin to think
that the scientific method

520
00:28:50,184 --> 00:28:52,416
and police method
have a lot in common.

521
00:28:52,456 --> 00:28:53,822
I never thought of it that way.

522
00:28:53,858 --> 00:28:54,917
Perhaps they do.

523
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,862
In science, we look
for the obvious.

524
00:28:56,897 --> 00:28:58,388
We track in a straight line.

525
00:28:58,434 --> 00:29:00,495
If something looks
too good to be true

526
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:01,801
it usually isn't true.

527
00:29:01,841 --> 00:29:04,038
If there appears to be
more to something

528
00:29:04,078 --> 00:29:06,378
than meets the eye,
there usually is more.

529
00:29:06,417 --> 00:29:07,783
We take it step by step.

530
00:29:07,819 --> 00:29:10,791
That applies to criminal
investigation as well.

531
00:29:10,825 --> 00:29:12,454
You do it very well.

532
00:29:12,496 --> 00:29:15,468
I'm very proud of you, Odo.

533
00:29:15,502 --> 00:29:16,800
Do you know that?

534
00:29:16,837 --> 00:29:17,998
Huh.

535
00:29:31,132 --> 00:29:32,430
Anything?

536
00:29:32,469 --> 00:29:35,839
The computer's having trouble
breaking down the DNA chains.

537
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:37,138
What about this pillar?

538
00:29:37,178 --> 00:29:39,011
Did the computer
have any success

539
00:29:39,048 --> 00:29:40,608
at decoding the encryptions?

540
00:29:40,652 --> 00:29:41,847
No luck there either.

541
00:29:41,887 --> 00:29:43,082
All things considered

542
00:29:43,123 --> 00:29:44,990
the computer's
having a bad week.

543
00:29:45,027 --> 00:29:48,124
We have such a limited database
for the Gamma Quadrant.

544
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:49,634
I have to close down
the Promenade.

545
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:52,198
Call me when you have something.

546
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:55,475
Wasn't that pillar
over here before?

547
00:29:55,515 --> 00:29:56,847
It was in my way.

548
00:29:56,884 --> 00:29:58,147
I had it moved.

549
00:30:01,427 --> 00:30:04,058
Have you compared this
new organic strain

550
00:30:04,098 --> 00:30:07,400
to the life-forms we brought
back from the planet?

551
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:10,240
Only enough to be sure
that they're not the same.

552
00:30:10,277 --> 00:30:12,144
It might be interesting to see

553
00:30:12,181 --> 00:30:14,583
if there are
any commonalties at all.

554
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:17,421
Let me run
a cross-tabulation analysis.

555
00:30:17,459 --> 00:30:19,793
It should only take
a few minutes.

556
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:23,268
Do you know Odo well,
Lieutenant?

557
00:30:23,303 --> 00:30:25,034
Not as well as I'd like to.

558
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,770
He keeps to himself a lot.

559
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:29,110
I'm not surprised.

560
00:30:29,148 --> 00:30:31,984
I never realized
till I actually saw him...

561
00:30:33,323 --> 00:30:36,295
how much I miss him.

562
00:30:36,329 --> 00:30:39,301
We didn't part
on very good terms, and...

563
00:30:39,335 --> 00:30:40,496
So I've heard.

564
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,475
Well...

565
00:30:43,511 --> 00:30:44,638
he wanted to leave

566
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,311
and we still had
so much work left to do.

567
00:30:47,352 --> 00:30:49,515
But I see him now, and I wonder

568
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,084
if he wasn't right
to go after all.

569
00:30:52,127 --> 00:30:54,097
He's come so far.

570
00:30:54,131 --> 00:30:57,764
He's an invaluable man
around here.

571
00:30:57,806 --> 00:31:01,576
I never thought he could do it...
integrate successfully.

572
00:31:01,614 --> 00:31:03,607
If you could have
seen him before...

573
00:31:03,718 --> 00:31:06,451
he was so ill-prepared
to be on his own.

574
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,426
I was sure he'd come back.

575
00:31:08,461 --> 00:31:11,331
I told him when he left
he'd come back

576
00:31:11,366 --> 00:31:14,031
and, all these years,
I was so certain

577
00:31:14,071 --> 00:31:18,171
that eventually, one day,
he'd show up at the lab.

578
00:31:20,685 --> 00:31:22,985
Well, I guess
I'd better get used

579
00:31:23,023 --> 00:31:24,766
to the idea he's not going to.

580
00:31:26,268 --> 00:31:27,931
Oh, here we are.

581
00:31:33,282 --> 00:31:34,409
Which one's this?

582
00:31:34,452 --> 00:31:36,922
That's the new one
from the Infirmary

583
00:31:36,957 --> 00:31:38,425
and this is the life-form
from the planet

584
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,396
but remember, it went
through several metamorphoses.

585
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:42,162
It's not the same entity.

586
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,502
The nucleotide sequences
are entirely different.

587
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:47,773
Some metachromic similarities.

588
00:31:47,812 --> 00:31:48,780
Yes...

589
00:31:48,814 --> 00:31:50,248
on a most basic level.

590
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,753
At best, they could
be distant cousins.

591
00:31:52,788 --> 00:31:56,785
The computer's broken down
the DNA chain on the new sample.

592
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,959
I can run an analysis
and see if it matches up

593
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:00,903
with any other life-form
in the computer.

594
00:32:00,938 --> 00:32:03,067
How long would that take?

595
00:32:03,109 --> 00:32:05,375
Two, three hours maybe.

596
00:32:06,415 --> 00:32:08,385
Let me know.

597
00:32:15,968 --> 00:32:19,099
Dr. Weld has regained
consciousness.

598
00:32:19,141 --> 00:32:21,772
It looks like he'll be fine.

599
00:32:21,813 --> 00:32:23,646
That's a relief.

600
00:32:26,656 --> 00:32:28,990
You don't seem relieved.

601
00:32:30,998 --> 00:32:35,132
You can tell that
just by observing me...

602
00:32:35,173 --> 00:32:38,977
the tone of my voice
my eyes, my body movement?

603
00:32:39,014 --> 00:32:40,482
Yes.

604
00:32:40,517 --> 00:32:45,983
You are truly a remarkable
life-form, Odo.

605
00:32:46,028 --> 00:32:50,732
But there is so much about you
we still don't understand.

606
00:32:50,771 --> 00:32:54,609
What are you getting at, Doctor?

607
00:32:54,645 --> 00:32:57,013
The computer has broken down
the DNA chain

608
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:59,920
from the organic sample
we found in the Infirmary.

609
00:32:59,956 --> 00:33:01,789
Dax is running
an analysis of it now.

610
00:33:01,826 --> 00:33:03,796
She'll identify it
in a couple of hours

611
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,390
but I already know what it is.

612
00:33:05,433 --> 00:33:07,335
I've seen it before.

613
00:33:10,009 --> 00:33:12,309
The organic sample...

614
00:33:12,347 --> 00:33:14,681
it's from you, Odo.

615
00:33:25,006 --> 00:33:26,839
The destruction
in the Science Lab

616
00:33:26,876 --> 00:33:29,780
occurred at 03:00 hours,
five minutes.

617
00:33:29,816 --> 00:33:34,223
The attack in the Infirmary
occurred at 19:35.

618
00:33:34,257 --> 00:33:36,591
Roughly 16 hours apart.

619
00:33:36,629 --> 00:33:39,499
Is your rejuvenation
period still 16 hours?

620
00:33:39,535 --> 00:33:43,873
Uh... I was in my pail
during both attacks.

621
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:46,142
But were you?

622
00:33:46,181 --> 00:33:47,649
I don't think so.

623
00:33:47,685 --> 00:33:50,155
I think, Odo,
that you've been placed

624
00:33:50,189 --> 00:33:54,220
in the ironic position of having
to track down yourself.

625
00:33:58,305 --> 00:33:59,796
How could this be?

626
00:33:59,842 --> 00:34:02,074
Has anything like this
ever occurred before?

627
00:34:02,113 --> 00:34:03,138
Of course not.

628
00:34:03,182 --> 00:34:04,343
Are you certain?

629
00:34:04,384 --> 00:34:05,647
Yes, I'm certain.

630
00:34:05,687 --> 00:34:08,180
There would have been incidents.

631
00:34:08,225 --> 00:34:10,753
Any unsolved crimes on the book?

632
00:34:10,797 --> 00:34:14,133
There are always
unsolved crimes.

633
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:17,574
Then the possibility exists.

634
00:34:17,611 --> 00:34:18,806
It doesn't!

635
00:34:18,847 --> 00:34:20,874
I do not commit criminal acts!

636
00:34:20,918 --> 00:34:22,512
It is not in my nature!

637
00:34:22,553 --> 00:34:24,318
Isn't it?

638
00:34:24,357 --> 00:34:27,888
The gas! Maybe it was
the gas on the planet.

639
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:28,900
It affected all of you.

640
00:34:28,934 --> 00:34:30,163
It must have done
something to me.

641
00:34:30,202 --> 00:34:31,170
A possibility.

642
00:34:31,204 --> 00:34:32,172
That has to be it.

643
00:34:32,206 --> 00:34:33,903
Certainly worthy
of an investigation.

644
00:34:33,944 --> 00:34:35,276
Dr. Bashir may be able...

645
00:34:35,313 --> 00:34:38,114
Dr. Bashir will not
understand any of this

646
00:34:38,152 --> 00:34:40,418
except that you have
turned into some kind

647
00:34:40,523 --> 00:34:43,016
of uncontrolled thing
that tried to kill him.

648
00:34:43,062 --> 00:34:45,898
Really, Odo, what do you
think they'll do with you?

649
00:34:45,934 --> 00:34:46,993
Do?

650
00:34:47,036 --> 00:34:49,029
They won't know
what to do with you!

651
00:34:49,074 --> 00:34:51,135
They'll put you
in a high-security prison

652
00:34:51,178 --> 00:34:53,809
or quarantine you
on a deserted asteroid

653
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:55,318
in the Gamma Quadrant.

654
00:34:55,353 --> 00:34:57,789
Odo, they'll put you in a zoo!

655
00:34:58,827 --> 00:35:01,320
I don't... believe that.

656
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:02,628
You don't know them.

657
00:35:02,668 --> 00:35:03,897
What other humanoid

658
00:35:03,937 --> 00:35:06,407
have you been able
to trust, except me?

659
00:35:06,475 --> 00:35:09,140
What makes you think
I trust you?

660
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:13,348
I resent that.

661
00:35:13,389 --> 00:35:15,018
I really do.

662
00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:17,792
After all the time
I invested in you

663
00:35:17,831 --> 00:35:19,824
after the education
I gave you

664
00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:21,429
the attention I gave you.

665
00:35:21,538 --> 00:35:25,239
You would not be here today
if it weren't for my guidance.

666
00:35:25,279 --> 00:35:28,115
I gave you more
than anyone else in my life!

667
00:35:28,152 --> 00:35:30,384
You were my life!

668
00:35:30,423 --> 00:35:32,222
And then you walked away.

669
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:36,098
And now you don't trust me.

670
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,102
Fine.

671
00:35:37,136 --> 00:35:39,869
Put yourself in their hands.

672
00:35:39,909 --> 00:35:43,040
You always had to learn your
lesson the hard way, didn't you?

673
00:35:44,952 --> 00:35:47,081
I...

674
00:35:47,123 --> 00:35:51,291
am not going back
to the Center with you.

675
00:35:51,331 --> 00:35:52,857
Why?

676
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:55,201
We'll work through this
together.

677
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:58,439
We'll solve it together,
just like we used to.

678
00:35:59,514 --> 00:36:01,507
No!

679
00:36:20,456 --> 00:36:23,428
I have a power failure
in Security, Commander.

680
00:36:23,462 --> 00:36:26,263
Sisko to Odo.

681
00:36:26,301 --> 00:36:27,769
Sisko to Odo!

682
00:36:27,804 --> 00:36:30,332
All deputies report
to the Security Office.

683
00:36:30,376 --> 00:36:31,936
Possible intruder.

684
00:36:31,979 --> 00:36:33,379
I'm tracking it.

685
00:36:33,415 --> 00:36:35,510
We have a power drain in
the life support conduit

686
00:36:35,619 --> 00:36:37,179
above the Security Office.

687
00:36:37,223 --> 00:36:40,218
If it's feeding off our power,
we may be able to slow it down

688
00:36:40,262 --> 00:36:43,861
by shutting off the primary flow
to the entire core section.

689
00:36:43,903 --> 00:36:44,893
Do it.

690
00:36:44,939 --> 00:36:46,499
Where the hell did it come from?

691
00:36:46,541 --> 00:36:48,238
Security to Ops.

692
00:36:48,278 --> 00:36:49,246
Go ahead.

693
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,509
There's no one down here, Major.

694
00:36:50,549 --> 00:36:52,314
And there's no sign of Odo?

695
00:36:52,353 --> 00:36:53,446
No, sir.

696
00:36:53,488 --> 00:36:55,822
I can help you with that, Major.

697
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:59,094
The creature you're after
is Odo.

698
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,567
There must have been some sort

699
00:37:00,669 --> 00:37:02,901
of metamorphic reaction
to the volcanic gas

700
00:37:02,941 --> 00:37:05,173
that we encountered
on the planet.

701
00:37:05,212 --> 00:37:07,148
Is there any way
to communicate with him?

702
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,151
I don't know.

703
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:09,745
It's not Odo, really.

704
00:37:09,788 --> 00:37:11,917
It's separate and independent

705
00:37:11,959 --> 00:37:13,895
from the Odo we know, and yet

706
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:16,230
at the very least,
it's aware of me.

707
00:37:16,268 --> 00:37:17,634
How can you know that?

708
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:20,801
The incident
in the Science Lab...

709
00:37:20,844 --> 00:37:22,643
I believe that was an attempt

710
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,643
to rescue the life-forms
I placed in containment.

711
00:37:26,688 --> 00:37:28,487
The second encounter

712
00:37:28,525 --> 00:37:31,497
occurred in the Infirmary,
where I was asleep.

713
00:37:31,531 --> 00:37:34,503
The third happened
just a couple of minutes ago

714
00:37:34,537 --> 00:37:38,032
when we got into a heated
discussion in Security.

715
00:37:40,917 --> 00:37:43,445
I think that even
the Constable himself

716
00:37:43,488 --> 00:37:47,223
would arrive at the same
conclusions given the evidence.

717
00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:53,604
On some instinctual level...

718
00:37:53,675 --> 00:37:56,054
the creature is
familiar with me.

719
00:37:57,357 --> 00:38:01,320
We might even conclude it has
hostile intentions toward you.

720
00:38:01,365 --> 00:38:02,856
It had occurred to me.

721
00:38:04,538 --> 00:38:07,169
The power shutdown
is complete, Commander.

722
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:09,339
Odo... or whatever
it is in there...

723
00:38:09,381 --> 00:38:11,510
has stopped moving
for the moment.

724
00:38:11,552 --> 00:38:13,954
Chief, based on your knowledge
of its behavior

725
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:16,461
if we can lure him out,
is there any way

726
00:38:16,495 --> 00:38:19,194
we can we set up
a force field to hold him?

727
00:38:19,234 --> 00:38:22,001
We could reverse polarity
on the energy fields.

728
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,374
That might work,
but it's only a guess.

729
00:38:24,411 --> 00:38:26,108
Set it up on the Promenade.

730
00:38:26,148 --> 00:38:28,209
I want a lot of room to operate.

731
00:38:28,252 --> 00:38:31,885
Major, station security teams
along the perimeter.

732
00:38:31,927 --> 00:38:35,024
How are we going to get him
to come out of the conduits?

733
00:38:35,066 --> 00:38:38,904
Maybe we could use some R-F
energy bursts to attract him.

734
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:41,309
There's only one way

735
00:38:41,412 --> 00:38:45,113
that you're going to attract
that creature into your trap.

736
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:49,989
It's me, it's after.

737
00:38:57,377 --> 00:38:58,845
Mr. O'Brien?

738
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,477
Our plan seems to be working,
Commander.

739
00:39:01,518 --> 00:39:03,681
He's following my trail
of energy crumbs

740
00:39:03,723 --> 00:39:05,021
directly toward you.

741
00:39:05,059 --> 00:39:07,291
On my signal, open the conduit
and let him in.

742
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:08,628
Aye, sir.

743
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:10,693
We're not sure
which vent he'll come through.

744
00:39:10,737 --> 00:39:12,297
Hopefully, it will be
the first one

745
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,706
available to him...
over there.

746
00:39:13,743 --> 00:39:17,877
If not, there are 17 others
he might choose.

747
00:39:17,918 --> 00:39:20,515
We're not stationing officers
near any of them.

748
00:39:20,556 --> 00:39:22,024
We don't want to scare him away.

749
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,257
I understand.

750
00:39:24,297 --> 00:39:26,767
Just get him to the force field.

751
00:39:26,802 --> 00:39:28,293
We'll do the rest.

752
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:35,511
Pass the word that phasers
are to be set on maximum stun.

753
00:39:35,553 --> 00:39:37,284
The moment Dr. Mora
appears to be

754
00:39:37,323 --> 00:39:38,814
in jeopardy, I'll open fire.

755
00:39:38,859 --> 00:39:40,692
Their orders are
to follow my lead.

756
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:43,361
If maximum stun doesn't
bring him down immediately

757
00:39:43,402 --> 00:39:44,870
we set phasers to kill.

758
00:39:44,906 --> 00:39:46,135
Commander...

759
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:47,200
I know, Major.

760
00:39:47,243 --> 00:39:48,837
Those are my orders.

761
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:58,086
Mr. O'Brien, we're ready.

762
00:39:58,132 --> 00:39:59,897
Releasing the conduit seal.

763
00:39:59,936 --> 00:40:02,840
Dr. Mora, did you hear that?

764
00:40:02,874 --> 00:40:04,206
Ready and waiting.

765
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:52,196
What are you waiting for?

766
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,230
I'm here.

767
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:56,907
And I'm not going anywhere.

768
00:41:41,505 --> 00:41:45,138
I've done it to you again,
haven't I, Odo?

769
00:41:45,179 --> 00:41:47,581
Made you a prisoner?

770
00:41:51,725 --> 00:41:55,722
Dear God, what have I done?

771
00:42:04,884 --> 00:42:07,788
Mr. O'Brien,
drop the force field.

772
00:42:07,824 --> 00:42:08,814
Aye, sir.

773
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,774
We have a lot... to talk about.

774
00:42:48,505 --> 00:42:52,275
I'm not going to try and explain
what happened to you, Odo

775
00:42:52,313 --> 00:42:54,806
because I haven't got
the vaguest idea.

776
00:42:54,851 --> 00:42:56,878
I can tell you
that with Dr. Mora's help

777
00:42:56,922 --> 00:42:59,392
we've managed to eliminate
all traces of the gas

778
00:42:59,427 --> 00:43:01,124
from your cellular structure.

779
00:43:01,164 --> 00:43:02,724
I prescribe rest

780
00:43:02,767 --> 00:43:06,069
because it's hard for a doctor
to go wrong with that one.

781
00:43:06,107 --> 00:43:10,343
Otherwise, there's not much more
I can do for you.

782
00:43:10,382 --> 00:43:12,113
Thank you, Doctor.

783
00:43:20,903 --> 00:43:22,532
I'm going home.

784
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:26,073
Dr. Mora...

785
00:43:27,917 --> 00:43:33,555
I want to be sure
you understand...

786
00:43:33,595 --> 00:43:35,895
I had no idea.

787
00:43:37,336 --> 00:43:42,472
You had to speak in a voice
loud enough for me to hear.

788
00:43:43,482 --> 00:43:45,076
I'm...

789
00:43:45,118 --> 00:43:47,315
sorry.

790
00:43:47,356 --> 00:43:50,226
I'm sorry it was necessary.

791
00:43:54,069 --> 00:43:57,041
I would like...

792
00:43:57,075 --> 00:44:00,536
in a very small way...

793
00:44:00,583 --> 00:44:02,610
to be part of your life again...

794
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,985
your life here

795
00:44:04,022 --> 00:44:05,582
on the station.

796
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:10,627
From time to time,
we could talk about things

797
00:44:10,669 --> 00:44:12,332
that matter to you...

798
00:44:12,373 --> 00:44:13,841
to us.

799
00:44:15,879 --> 00:44:18,407
I'd like that.
