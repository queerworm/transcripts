1
00:00:01,042 --> 00:00:03,796
QUARK:
I am merely
a businessman.

2
00:00:03,838 --> 00:00:05,422
It would take an orator

3
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:07,716
with the skills of the late,
great Plegg himself

4
00:00:07,758 --> 00:00:10,928
to sing the praises
of the late, great Plegg.

5
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:14,139
What Ferengi could resist
the honor of owning

6
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,642
a small piece of the man
that took a computer chip

7
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:20,771
and turned it into
the modular holosuite industry?

8
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,898
A small piece of the man

9
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,317
that brought
holographic entertainment

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,695
to the most remote parts
of the Quadrant

11
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,905
creating profit centers

12
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:33,617
from societies that could
barely afford to feed
their own people.

13
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:35,577
How much are
you asking?

14
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:38,747
As I was about to tell
my good friend here

15
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:40,958
a mere three strips
of latinum.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,418
And, uh, I'd be taking
a loss at that price.

17
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,795
(<i> grunts</i> )

18
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:48,423
Okay, for you, two strips.

19
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:53,888
Thank you very much.

20
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,138
Three strips?

21
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,974
That's a fair price
for Plegg.

22
00:00:57,016 --> 00:00:58,600
I suppose you're interested?

23
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:01,603
Humanoid death rituals
are an interest of mine.

24
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:02,771
Death rituals.

25
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:04,023
Everybody needs a hobby.

26
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,232
Mm-hmm.

27
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:07,067
Some species
burn their dead,

28
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:09,028
others pack them
in blocks of ice.

29
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,405
Some even surround
themselves

30
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,656
with the company
of family corpses.

31
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:15,701
But the Ferengi
ritual

32
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:17,786
of chopping up
their loved ones

33
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:19,663
and selling them...

34
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:23,417
I find that irresistible.

35
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,377
I'm very busy here.

36
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,588
What a fitting
and distinguished way

37
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:30,883
to honor the memory
of great Ferengi entrepreneurs.

38
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:32,885
I'm thinking of starting
a collection

39
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:35,429
putting up a display case
in my office.

40
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,639
There'll be a special
space in there

41
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:40,141
reserved just
for you, Quark.

42
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:43,979
I'm sure.

43
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:52,071
You're serious?

44
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,949
Have you ever
known me not to be?

45
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:04,959
There is one thing
I was curious about.

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,293
And what's that?

47
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,836
How do I know
it's Plegg?

48
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,630
It says so
on the label.

49
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,299
Isn't there some
sort of letter
of authenticity?

50
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,761
The Ferengi Seal
of Dismemberment
is right here.

51
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:17,429
What more do you want?

52
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:18,430
I want Plegg.

53
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:19,514
You got him!

54
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,016
Not if he's still alive.

55
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:22,434
Still alive?

56
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,896
Still alive.

57
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:27,314
Plegg?

58
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,984
After I tracked him
down on Khosla II,

59
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,526
I told him about
your little scheme

60
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,945
he was quite amused.

61
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:34,822
I'm not.

62
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,783
Odo, I'm a victim here.

63
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:39,910
I bought these discs
in good faith.

64
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:42,496
I have 5,000 pieces
of Plegg in my storeroom.

65
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,957
Uh-uh-uh, not Plegg.

66
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:46,125
Then who?

67
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,626
Good question.

68
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,629
I demand
an investigation.

69
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,132
You'll get one,
I promise you.

70
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:54,842
MAN:
Odo!

71
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,054
Dr. Mora.

72
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:03,182
It's been too long.

73
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,311
You're looking well.

74
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,064
Yes...

75
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,066
coming along nicely.

76
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,194
Why didn't you
let me know

77
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,655
that you were coming?

78
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,073
It was a last-minute
arrangement.

79
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,617
Uh-huh. The trip
from Bajor

80
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:22,201
takes five hours.

81
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:25,039
Can I get you something...
Dr., uh, Mora, was it?

82
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,208
Yes, some, uh, Deka tea
would be nice.

83
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,130
Hmm.

84
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,760
Haven't quite managed
the ears yet, have you?

85
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:41,429
Oh, no, but they're--
they're difficult.

86
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,306
Is the suit a suit,
or part of you?

87
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,933
Oh, and what about
the boots?

88
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:46,309
Here we are.

89
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,686
Nice and hot.

90
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:48,812
Thank you.

91
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,189
So, um...

92
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,273
you two seem to be
old friends.

93
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,818
Dr. Mora is the
Bajoran scientist

94
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,862
who was assigned to
me after I was found.

95
00:03:56,904 --> 00:04:00,365
I was personally responsible
for his development

96
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,742
during his formative years.

97
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,660
QUARK:
So, this<i> is</i> a
family reunion.

98
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,286
I had a hunch.

99
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,915
Well, Odo's dad is
always welcome at Quark's.

100
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,875
He is<i> not--</i>
Actually...

101
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,626
QUARK: I know he wouldn't
tell you himself

102
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,420
but Odo is doing a wonderful
job here on the station

103
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,505
if I may say so.
Is he?

104
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:17,716
QUARK: Absolutely.
As a matter of fact

105
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:20,010
when you came in, he was
just beginning a fraud
investigation.

106
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:21,344
Quark!

107
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,015
Excuse us.

108
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:26,641
Of course.

109
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,853
The two of you have
a lot of catching up to do.

110
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:33,023
If there's anything
I can help you with, Doctor

111
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:35,901
don't hesitate to
call on me.

112
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,277
DR. MORA:
That was uncalled-for.

113
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,446
ODO:
Huh! You don't
know Quark.

114
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,448
I know that he was
trying to present you

115
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,283
in as positive a light
as possible

116
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:46,661
to someone he thought
was important to you.

117
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,038
And you responded with--

118
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,664
Please!

119
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,708
Still having trouble
with social integration.

120
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,668
I integrate as much
as I want to.

121
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,712
Define "as much
as I want to."

122
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,547
"As much as I want to"

123
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:01,509
<i>means</i> as much
as I want to.

124
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:02,928
Hmm.

125
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:06,765
Quark is a thief,
a con man...

126
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,184
nobody you
want to know.

127
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:15,440
So, um, tell me about
this police thing

128
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,484
you've gotten yourself
involved with.

129
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,902
Is it working out?

130
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:21,780
I enjoy my work
as Chief of Security.

131
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,782
DR. MORA:
Chief of Security

132
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,118
at a way station in space.

133
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,370
Don't you miss it, Odo?

134
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,123
What?

135
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:32,666
DR. MORA:
Our work.

136
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,334
Never.

137
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,295
(<i> chuckles )</i>
I don't believe it.

138
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:37,838
I know you too well.

139
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,464
You were unhappy in the lab.

140
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:40,882
I can't blame you for that.

141
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:44,261
But the work,
Odo, the work.

142
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:46,345
The exploration of you

143
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:49,390
what you are,
where you came from.

144
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:52,186
That's never far
from your mind, is it?

145
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:56,397
That part of it...
is true.

146
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,816
DR. MORA:
Good.

147
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,777
Because I came here
counting on that.

148
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:10,120
(<i> theme music plays</i> )

149
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,159
See you later, Dad.

150
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,368
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hold on!

151
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,453
I'm late.

152
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,454
For what?

153
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,621
For Nog.

154
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,123
Your homework.
It's done.

155
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,458
You studied that
entire Klingon opera

156
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,084
for the music
test on Friday?

157
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,086
I'm going to ace the test,
Dad, I promise.

158
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,380
This isn't about tests, Jake.
This is about learning.

159
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,174
You can't learn to
appreciate Klingon opera

160
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,092
by cramming for the
exam the night before.

161
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:31,594
What am I ever going to use
Klingon opera for?

162
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,013
Well...

163
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,099
first of all

164
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:38,310
you don't know what you're
going to be when you grow up.

165
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:42,063
You may discover along the way
that you want to be a musician

166
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,316
or you may
find yourself

167
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,526
among some Klingons...

168
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,321

00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:51,823
Dad, even if I did

170
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,450
they wouldn't be going
around singing operas.

171
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:55,410
It helps you understand
their culture.

172
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:58,038
When was the last time you
listened to Klingon opera?

173
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,499
When I was your age.

Yes. Do you?

00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,380
Just because you
suffered through all that

177
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,340
doesn't mean
I have to.

00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,514
I have the perfect
solution.

183
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,098
Nog has the same test.

184
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,892
Why don't you invite him over

185
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,019
and you can listen to the
Klingon opera together?

186
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,648
Please, Odo, sit down.

187
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,115
Commander,
I'd like to request

188
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,700
the use of a runabout.

189
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,202
Of course. For what?

190
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:38,828
A Dr. Mora Pol

191
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,331
from the Bajoran Institute
of Science has asked me

192
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:43,917
to help him secure
one from the Federation.

193
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,626
Why did he come to you?

194
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,629
Dr. Mora is the scientist
who was assigned to me

195
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,465
in my first years here.

196
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,134
If he went to the
Board of Ministers

197
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:54,969
to request permission
to approach you

198
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,388
it would take months.

199
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,098
And he's very anxious
to investigate

200
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,891
something in the
Gamma Quadrant.

201
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,144
And, may I say,
Commander, so am I.

202
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,564
You've gotten me curious,
Constable.

203
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:06,981
Is it a secret?

204
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:10,318
No, but there isn't
much to tell.

205
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:15,198
One of the Bajoran
science probes recently
scanned a planet

206
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,825
about six light-years
from the wormhole.

207
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:21,496
It picked up some very
unique-- and familiar--

208
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:22,872
DNA patterns.

209
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:25,625
Patterns very much
like my own, Commander.

210
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,462
Dr. Mora thinks he
may have discovered

211
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:30,338
the origin of my people.

212
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,300
Of me.

213
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,062
DR MORA:
It would seem to me

214
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,189
that being a scientist
yourself, Lieutenant

215
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:51,151
you can appreciate
the difficulty
of our dilemma

216
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,653
and the elegance
of the solution.

217
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,572
When Odo was first found

218
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:57,574
nobody knew who--
or, indeed,<i> what--</i>

219
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:59,242
it was we were dealing with.

220
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:02,496
A shapeless,
viscous mass of fluid...

221
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,456
a veritable organic broth.

222
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,333
That was our Odo
in the beginning.

223
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,917
When did you realize

224
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,170
you were dealing with
a sentient life-form?

225
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,379
He didn't.

226
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,922
I had to teach him
that myself.

227
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,673
(<i> laughs</i> )

228
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:17,594
It's true.
It's very true.

229
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:19,053
Tell her.

230
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,848
It was a dilemma
for me.

231
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,933
I had never seen anything
like these creatures either.

232
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,561
"Seen" isn't really
an appropriate description.

233
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,062
He had no eyes, per se.

234
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,314
I was just trying

235
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:30,649
to describe it
in simple terms.

236
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:33,610
DR. MORA:
He had never<i> perceived</i>

237
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:35,445
anything like us before.

238
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,822
Go on.

239
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,950
I knew I had to find some way
to communicate with them

240
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:43,036
so I transformed
myself into--

241
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,496
DR. MORA:
It was remarkable.

242
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:45,704
Every morning

243
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,040
I would come into the lab

244
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,833
and every morning,
Odo would be there

245
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,336
resting in his liquid form
in a Krokan petri beaker.

246
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,214
One morning I walked in
and Odo was gone.

247
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,841
The beaker was empty,
but next to it

248
00:11:56,883 --> 00:12:00,554
was an identical beaker
that had not been there
before--

249
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:04,683
a perfect replica
in every way.

250
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:07,768
(<i> sighing</i> ):
It was... amazing.

251
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:12,857
Oh, it hasn't been the same
since you've gone, Odo.

252
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,484
(<i> sighs</i> )

253
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,486
Working with you

254
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:20,448
has been the most rewarding
part of my career.

255
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,950
Hmm!
DAX: We're approaching
the planet

256
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,078
Prepare to enter standard
orbit.

257
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:27,830
Planet designated L-S VI.

258
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,541
Initiating scans.

259
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,586
There's a lot of
seismic activity down there

260
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,629
possibly volcanic
in origin.

261
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,382
Moving into
synchronous orbit.

262
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,628
Do the letters mean
anything to you?

263
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,963
No, I don't think so.

264
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,591
Judging by its position
in the ruins

265
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,217
I think it's fair to say

266
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,386
that this pillar represented
something important

267
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,054
to the people
who lived here.

268
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:26,431
DAX:
Why don't we take
it with us?

269
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,141
Our computers back
on the station

270
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,684
might be able
to decipher
the inscriptions.

271
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,311
Mm-hmm.
Where is Dr. Weld?

272
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,646
(<i> yelling</i> ):
Dr. Weld?

273
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,397
DR. WELD:
Over here.

274
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,448
I think I may have found
what we're looking for.

275
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,247
Is it carbon-based?

276
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:52,624
No, silicate

277
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:56,169
but vegetative,
and very much alive.

278
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:59,798
Odo, Jr., perhaps.

279
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:15,062
Computer,
begin transport.

280
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,111
(<i> rumbling</i> )

281
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,788
Come on!

282
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,960
(<i> grunts</i> )

283
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,088
DAX:
Computer, realign
transporter.

284
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,965
Lock onto
our combadges.

285
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,884
COMPUTER:
Stand by.

286
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,595
ODO:
This way.

287
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:49,889
(<i> hissing</i> )

288
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,058
(<i> coughing</i> )

289
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,814
(<i> coughing</i> )

290
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,944
COMPUTER:
Ready for transport.

291
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,530
Computer, energize!

292
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,047
They're stable for now.

293
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,924
Dax is in fair condition

294
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,719
but the Bajorans seem to be
more seriously affected.

295
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:29,721
Perhaps they were exposed
to more of the gas

296
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:32,223
or there may be something
about Trill physiology.

297
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,307
I'm not sure yet.

298
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,267
And Odo?

299
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,560
I'm fine.

300
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,353
The paralyzing
action occurred

301
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:38,813
when the gas was taken into
the respiratory system.

302
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,440
And since Odo
doesn't<i> have</i>

303
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,108
a respiratory system
as we know it

304
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,318
he apparently wasn't
affected at all.

305
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,987
O'Brien has off-loaded
the cargo they brought back.

306
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,115
He has everything set up
in the science lab.

307
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:52,577
I understand there are
some organic specimens
from that planet.

308
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,662
Maybe there's something there
to help you figure this out.

309
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,080
BASHIR:
Good idea.

310
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,916
Will he be
all right?

311
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,169
The molecule appears to have
quite an unstable structure.

312
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,171
That might mean
the effect is temporary.

313
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:22,941
SISKO:
I know how you feel,
Constable.

314
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,777
ODO:
Feel?
About what?

315
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,529
SISKO:
When my father
became ill

316
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,824
I can remember
how small and weak

317
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,659
he looked there,
lying on the bed.

318
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,036
He'd been so strong,
so independent.

319
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,415
It always seemed to me
that there was nothing
that he couldn't do.

320
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:42,335
But, in the end,
I realized

321
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,671
there was nothing
that he<i> could</i> do

322
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,881
and nothing I could do
to help him.

323
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:51,385
I appreciate your thoughts,
Commander

324
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:55,306
but Dr. Mora
is not my father.

325
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,361
The computer is
having a hard time

326
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,029
classifying
your new life-form.

327
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,364
Why?

328
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,825
Whatever it is,
it keeps changing.

329
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,202
Somehow it goes through
a metamorphosis

330
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,745
every time
it reproduces

331
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:18,997
and it reproduces
like crazy.

332
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,748
Look at this.

333
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,918
It multiplied so much, I
had to change containers.

334
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:28,088
I'll put it in a level-5
security field overnight.

335
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:31,801
I wish Dax were here
to take a look at it.

336
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:33,386
How's she doing?

337
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,222
Dr. Bashir thinks
she'll be fine.

338
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,944
Any idea what it is?

339
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:53,740
I'm hoping it's a
key, Mr. O'Brien...

340
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,992
a key to my past.

341
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,017
KIRA:
Kira to Sisko.

342
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,022
Go ahead, Major.

343
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:28,148
KIRA:
Sorry to bother you,
Commander

344
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,984
but we need you up here
in the Science Lab.

345
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:32,570
I'm on my way.

346
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,157
MAN:
...the scan, sir.

347
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,326
No positive ID
on the life-form.

348
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:44,040
The holographic
readout...

349
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,775
Any signs of
a break-in?

350
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,068
Not that we
could find.

351
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,527
The security seal
on the lab

352
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,404
was still in place
when we got here.

353
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,657
I can't imagine why anyone
would want to steal that
thing, anyway.

354
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:20,618
You're suggesting
the life-form, itself,
did this?

355
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,536
I don't know<i> what</i>
did this, Commander

356
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,247
unless a tornado
passed this way
without us hearing it.

357
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,958
The room was locked.
It's gone.

358
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,751
That's all I
know for now.

359
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:30,586
Constable, get
a level-3 security scan

360
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:32,296
underway on
the entire station.

361
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:33,339
O'BRIEN:
Our scanners
may have trouble

362
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,799
finding this life-form.

363
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,300
It has metamorphic
qualities

364
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,052
that were confusing
the computer.

365
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,595
You might want
to run that sweep
two or three times.

366
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:41,305
Let's go to
Yellow Alert.

367
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,350
Major, you could help
me by reviewing

368
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,936
the security camera records
and the heat sensor readouts

369
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:49,188
for the lab and the
surrounding areas.

370
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,608
Commander

371
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,110
I'm picking up slight
trace elements

372
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:56,195
near the ventilation
intake duct.

373
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:59,073
It looks as though
our life-form may have
taken this way out.

374
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,079
SISKO:
Dr. Bashir gave you

375
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:07,373
permission to be
up and about?

376
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,000
Dr. Bashir wouldn't
listen to me

377
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,417
and hid my clothes,
so I wouldn't leave.

378
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,294
I had to sneak out
to my quarters

379
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,921
in a hospital gown
that wouldn't close in the
back.

380
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,422
DAX:
What did this?

381
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,008
The working theory is
that life-form

382
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,968
you brought back
is somehow responsible.

383
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,012
I don't believe it.

384
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,930
Good. Find me
a better theory.

385
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:26,726
Odo, Dr. Mora is awake

386
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,895
and would like
to speak with you.

387
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,122
DR. MORA:
I heard them say

388
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:49,957
something happened
in the lab.

389
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,792
The life-form sample is gone.

390
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,169
Gone!

391
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:54,420
ODO:
We're not sure
how or why yet.

392
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:55,504
I want to help.

393
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:57,548
Everything is
under control.

394
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,926
I know more about
shape-shifters
than anyone in this sector.

395
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:03,221
Anyone except me, and I'll
be running the investigation.

396
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,555
Besides, we're
not even sure

397
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,141
it<i> is</i> a shape-shifting
life-form.

398
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,894
Any metamorphic
characteristics?

399
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:13,064
It was changing faster
than the computer could
analyze.

400
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:14,941
Any indication
of intelligence?

401
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,859
ODO:
Not unless
you consider

402
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,987
wanton destruction
of the lab an indication
of intelligence.

403
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,949
It might be.
It might be.

404
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,952
Don't dismiss
<i>any possibility.</i>

405
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:33,042
MORA:
Dr. Weld hasn't
regained consciousness.

406
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:35,419
(<i> sighs</i> )

407
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,797
I feel responsible.

408
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:41,008
I'm sure Dr. Bashir
is doing everything possible.

409
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:03,363
The same trace elements
are inside the duct.

410
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:04,949
O'BRIEN:
I'm following the trail.

411
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:07,409
Moving toward corridor 2-H.

412
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,163
Nothing's showing up
anywhere on the scanners,
Chief.

413
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:11,580
O'BRIEN:
Yeah, I figured as much.

414
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:14,167
Did the security cameras
in the lab give you anything?

415
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:17,920
ODO:
The security cameras stopped
operating for 43 seconds

416
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:22,175
at 03:00 hours, five minutes--
right when the alarm sounded.

417
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:25,178
Stopped? You mean,
someone turned them off.

418
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:27,930
More likely some kind
of power interruption.

419
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:29,473
It might have affected

420
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,225
the security field
around the life-form, too.

421
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:32,726
We're trying
to analyze it now.

422
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,436
Do the heat sensors
in the lab show

423
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,563
any thermal deviation
at the same time?

424
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:39,942
SISKO:
Almost a six degree increase
during the 43 seconds.

425
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:42,695
But then back to
normal after that?

426
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,113
SISKO:
Affirmative.

427
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:45,698
Oh.

428
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:49,160
We may be dealing
with an entity that absorbs

429
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:51,996
low-frequency R-F energy.

430
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:54,123
O'BRIEN:
It might be feeding
off our power.

431
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:57,543
But an energy drain should be
showing up on our scans.

432
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,045
Yeah, that's true,
Constable.

433
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,296
I don't get it.

434
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:04,091
Maybe this thermal deviation
was a result of...

435
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:05,467
(<i> howling whoosh</i> )

436
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:06,719
SISKO:
Chief?

437
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,428
Hold on, I hear something.

438
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:10,430
We've got your position.

439
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,850
Nothing else is showing
up anywhere near you.

440
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,187
Well, I definitely
hear something ahead.

441
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:21,608
Can you hear it
on the com line?

442
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,902
No.

443
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:29,033
It almost sounds like...
I can't describe it.

444
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,578
I'm moving in closer.

445
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:36,957
If you run into my wife,
don't mention I did this.

446
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:40,544
Move some backup to
the nearest corridor.

447
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:44,006
Security to core section,
Level Four, corridor 2-H.

448
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:46,008
O'BRIEN:
When I come home tonight
she'll ask me how my day was

449
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:51,264
and I'll say, "Fine, honey.
How was yours?"

450
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,642
Sometimes I don't think she
really wants to know the truth.

451
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:59,105
So I do us both
a favor, and...

452
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,232
Oh...

453
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,483
It's a structural breach.

454
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:04,818
(<i> screams</i> )

455
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,280
O'Brien, report.

456
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:10,574
(<i> pants</i> )
I'm okay. I'm fine.

457
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:14,494
I think I found
our missing life-form.

458
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:23,254
Except it isn't a life-form
anymore. It's dead.

459
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:29,551
SISKO:
<i>Station Log, Stardate 47391.7.</i>

460
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:32,763
Engineering crews have been
working for over 15 hours

461
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,307
searching conduits.

462
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:36,225
There have been
no additional incidents

463
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:37,726
and no further evidence

464
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:40,438
of the alien life-form
has been found.

465
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:43,065
BASHIR:
With this kind
of cellular structure

466
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:44,482
the life-form
would have needed

467
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,193
a higher concentration
of carbon dioxide

468
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:48,112
than our atmosphere
provides.

469
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:50,114
It just couldn't
survive out of its
own environment.

470
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:51,615
Well, that would
be my analysis.

471
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,326
But, with that in mind,
do you still think

472
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:55,535
this life-form was capable
of destroying the lab?

473
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,288
(<i> sighs</i> )

474
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:58,998
That's not impossible.

475
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,416
The environmental impact

476
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:02,293
might have taken
some time to set in.

477
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:05,629
I'd really like to get
Dr. Mora's opinion
on all of this.

478
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:07,173
Well, he's much better.

479
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,924
He should be up
and around in the morning.

480
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:10,301
Feel like getting
a<i> raktajino</i>

481
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:11,469
before we call it
a night?

482
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:13,553
My replicator or yours?

483
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:17,433
I was thinking
more of the Promenade.

484
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:19,685
(<i> chuckles</i> )
I knew that.

485
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,270
Well, thanks, anyway.

486
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:23,563
Um, I got a few things
to wrap up around here.

487
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,774
Sleep tight, Julian.

488
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,948
She enjoys it.

489
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:37,244
She actually gets some
kind of perverse pleasure
out of it.

490
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:41,123
And one of these days,
I'm going to stop chasing her

491
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,876
and then we'll see.

492
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,379
(<i> distant rattling</i> )

493
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:11,278
(<i> beeping</i> )

494
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:16,325
(<i> howling whoosh</i> )

495
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:23,416
(<i> howling whoosh</i> )

496
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,338
(<i> howling whoosh</i> )

497
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,096
Emergency.

498
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,596
Emergency!

499
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:40,849
Intruder alert.

500
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:57,032
BASHIR:
It happened
so quickly.

501
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,910
I'm sorry I can't tell you
any more about it.

502
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:03,289
It was behind me,
and then it was gone

503
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,083
but it was big,
very big.

504
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:08,877
How badly did
you injure it?

505
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,463
I don't know.

506
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:13,382
I don't even know
if I injured it at all.

507
00:27:13,424 --> 00:27:15,301
I just hit it once
with a laser scalpel

508
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:16,969
in the arm or the leg

509
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,678
or the tentacle
or whatever it was.

510
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,223
And then it went
off the wall and was gone.

511
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:23,976
It appears as though
our life-form has survived

512
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:26,270
and grown into something
interesting.

513
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:27,729
Did you notice
anything

514
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,356
when you entered
the room, Doctor?

515
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,984
Anything out of place,
anything unusual?

516
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:36,780
Was it unusually
warm, perhaps?

517
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:39,366
Now that you come
to mention it,

518
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:41,410
it was a bit warm
in here.

519
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,745
Another thermal
distortion.

520
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,872
Did you try
the lights, Doctor?

521
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,792
No, I--I didn't want
to disturb the patients.

522
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,461
Commander, I suggest
we check

523
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:52,630
the R-F energy flow
to the Infirmary.

524
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,299
We might find a power
interruption, as we
did in the lab.

525
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:57,301
DAX:
No blood or any
fluid traces

526
00:27:57,343 --> 00:27:59,178
but I am picking up
a very slight trail of
something

527
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,721
we didn't see last time--
an organic residue.

528
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,349
Enough to test?
We'll see.

529
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:04,724
Sisko to Ops.

530
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,435
KIRA:
Go ahead.

531
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:07,436
SISKO:
Restrict all nonessential
personnel

532
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:08,521
to their quarters

533
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:09,813
and go to Red Alert, Major.

534
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:11,315
KIRA:
Understood.

535
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:12,941
Keep in touch
with Dax's progress.

536
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:14,401
She may give us a way
to track this thing.

537
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:16,403
Until we can,
I suggest

538
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:17,779
we close down
the Promenade.

539
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,448
I'll give the order,
Constable.

540
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:22,368
"Constable"?

541
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,870
It's a nickname that
I barely tolerate.

542
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:27,206
It's an expression
of affection

543
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,500
that you find
difficult to accept.

544
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:31,669
(<i> scoffs</i> )

545
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:41,261
You know, that
was a remarkable
display back there.

546
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:42,846
"Display"?

547
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:45,224
Yes, you were very
careful, attentive.

548
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,059
I was just
doing my job.

549
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,436
I begin to think that
the scientific method

550
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,564
and police method
have a lot in common.

551
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:53,899
I never thought
of it that way.
Perhaps they do.

552
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,401
Well, in science,
we look for the obvious.

553
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:57,277
We track in a
straight line.

554
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:59,363
If something looks
too good to be true

555
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:00,864
it usually isn't true.

556
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:02,866
If there appears to be
more to something

557
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:05,160
than meets the eye,
there usually is more.

558
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:06,704
We take it step by step.

559
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,415
That applies to criminal
investigation as well.

560
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,957
You do it very well.

561
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,294
I'm very proud
of you, Odo.

562
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:15,795
Do you know that?

563
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,339
Huh.

564
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:31,937
Anything?

565
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:35,107
The computer's having trouble
breaking down the DNA chains.

566
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,525
What about
this pillar?

567
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:38,360
Did the computer
have any success

568
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:39,861
at decoding the
encryptions?

569
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,154
No luck there either.

570
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,531
All things considered

571
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:44,241
the computer's
having a bad week.

572
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:46,118
We have such
a limited database

573
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,453
for the Gamma Quadrant.

574
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:48,828
I have to close down
the Promenade.

575
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,414
Call me when
you have something.

576
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:54,668
Wasn't that pillar
over here before?

577
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,128
It was in my way.

578
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,463
I had it moved.

579
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:04,010
Have you compared this
new organic strain

580
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,805
to the life-forms
we brought back
from the planet?

581
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:09,182
Only enough
to be sure that
they're not the same.

582
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,393
It might be
interesting to see

583
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:13,604
if there are any
commonalties at all.

584
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:16,231
Let me run
a cross-tabulation
analysis.

585
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:18,233
It should only take
a few minutes.

586
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,028
Do you know Odo well,
Lieutenant?

587
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,239
Not as well
as I'd like to.

588
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:25,449
He keeps
to himself a lot.

589
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:27,200
I'm not surprised.

590
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:30,621
I never realized
till I actually saw him...

591
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:32,623
(<i> laughs</i> )

592
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:34,916
how much I miss him.

593
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:38,170
We didn't part
on very good terms, and...

594
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,797
So I've heard.

595
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:42,299
Well...

596
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:43,759
he wanted to leave

597
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:46,345
when we still had
so much work left to do.

598
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,972
But I see him now,
and I wonder

599
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:51,308
if he wasn't right
to go after all.

600
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,226
He's come so far.

601
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,855
He's an invaluable man
around here.

602
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:59,107
I never thought
he could do it--

603
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:00,693
integrate
successfully.

604
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,235
If you could have
seen him before--

605
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:05,197
he was so ill-prepared
to be on his own.

606
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,366
I was sure
he'd come back.

607
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:10,160
I told him when he
left he'd come back

608
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,705
and all these years,
I was so certain

609
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:17,083
that eventually, one day,
he'd show up at the lab.

610
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:22,214
Well, I guess I'd
better get used

611
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:24,424
to the idea
he's not going to.

612
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:25,843
(<i> beeping</i> )

613
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,678
Oh, here we are.

614
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,309
Which one's this?

615
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:36,061
That's the new one
from the Infirmary

616
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,688
and this is the life-form
from the planet

617
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,981
but remember, it went
through several metamorphoses.

618
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,734
It's not the same entity.

619
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:45,153
The nucleotide sequences
are entirely different.

620
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:47,280
Some metachromic
similarities.

621
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:48,281
DR. MORA:
Yes...

622
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:49,742
on a most basic level.

623
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:52,244
At best, they could
be distant cousins.

624
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:54,204
DAX:
The computer's broken down

625
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,289
the DNA chain
on the new sample.

626
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,709
I can run an analysis
and see if it matches up

627
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:00,293
with any other life-form
in the computer.

628
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,713
How--how long
would that take?

629
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:05,006
Two, three hours maybe.

630
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,133
Let me know.

631
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,724
(<i> door opens</i> )

632
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:18,311
Dr. Weld has regained
consciousness.

633
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,731
It looks like
he'll be fine.

634
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:23,316
That's a relief.

635
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,739
You don't
<i>seem</i> relieved.

636
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:34,035
You can tell that
just by observing me--

637
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:35,995
the tone of my voice,

638
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,497
my eyes,
my body movement?

639
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:39,583
Yes.

640
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:44,254
You are truly a remarkable
life-form, Odo.

641
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:50,218
But there is so much
about you we still
don't understand.

642
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:52,930
What are you getting at,
Doctor?

643
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:56,266
The computer has broken down
the DNA chain

644
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:59,269
from the organic sample
we found in the Infirmary.

645
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,354
Dax is running
an analysis of it now.

646
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,148
She'll identify it
in a couple of hours

647
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:05,024
but I already
know what it is.

648
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,944
I've seen it before.

649
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,114
The organic sample...

650
00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:13,909
it's from you, Odo.

651
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,129
The destruction
in the Science Lab

652
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,966
occurred at 03:00 hours,
five minutes.

653
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:33,595
The attack in the Infirmary
occurred at 19:35.

654
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:35,722
Roughly 16 hours apart.

655
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:38,851
Is your rejuvenation
period still 16 hours?

656
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:43,271
Uh, I was in my pail
during both attacks.

657
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,524
But were you?

658
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:46,984
I don't think so.

659
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,319
I think, Odo,
that you've been placed

660
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:53,740
in the ironic position
of having to track down
yourself.

661
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:56,075
(<i> scoffs</i> )

662
00:33:57,661 --> 00:33:59,078
How could this be?

663
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,456
Has anything like this
ever occurred before?

664
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:02,582
Of course not.

665
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,792
Are you certain?

666
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:05,084
Yes, I'm certain.

667
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,546
There would have been
incidents.

668
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,088
Any unsolved crimes

669
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,465
on the book?

670
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:13,510
There are always
unsolved crimes.

671
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:16,889
Then the possibility exists.

672
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,056
It doesn't!

673
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:20,183
I do not commit
criminal acts!

674
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:21,810
It is not in my nature!

675
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:23,729
Isn't it?

676
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:27,232
The gas! Maybe it was
the gas on the planet.

677
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:28,525
It affected all of you.

678
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:29,860
It must have done
something to me.

679
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:31,403
A possibility.
That has to be it.

680
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:33,279
Certainly worthy of
an investigation.

681
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,656
Dr. Bashir may be able--

682
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:37,367
Dr. Bashir will not
understand any of this

683
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,786
except that you have
turned into some kind

684
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:42,205
of uncontrolled thing
that tried to kill him.

685
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:45,291
Really, Odo, what do you
think they'll do with you?

686
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:46,919
"Do"?

687
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,587
They won't know
what to do with you!

688
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,380
They'll put you in a
high-security prison

689
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:53,132
or quarantine you on
a deserted asteroid

690
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,509
in the Gamma Quadrant.

691
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:55,928
Odo, they'll
put you in a zoo!

692
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:57,303
(<i> gasps</i> )

693
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,557
I don't...
believe that.

694
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:01,892
You don't know them.

695
00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:03,309
What other humanoid

696
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,812
have you been able
to trust, except me?

697
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:08,481
What makes you think
I trust you?

698
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:12,778
I resent that.

699
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,362
I really do.

700
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:16,990
After all the time
I invested in you

701
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:19,034
after the education
I gave you

702
00:35:19,076 --> 00:35:20,911
the attention
I gave you.

703
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:24,247
You would not be here today
if it weren't for my guidance.

704
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:27,459
I gave you more
than anyone else in my life!

705
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,127
DR. MORA:
You were my life!

706
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:31,546
And then you
walked away.

707
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:35,425
And now you don't trust<i> me.</i>

708
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:36,802
DR. MORA:
Fine.

709
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,929
Put yourself
in their hands.

710
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:42,307
You always had to learn
your lesson the hard way,
didn't you?

711
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:46,311
I...

712
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:50,649
am not going back
to the Center with you.

713
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:51,900
Why?

714
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:54,277
We'll work through this
together.

715
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:56,071
We'll solve it
together

716
00:35:56,113 --> 00:35:57,864
just like we used to.

717
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:00,575
No!

718
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:04,412
(<i> Odo groans</i> )

719
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:06,999
(<i> moaning</i> )

720
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:13,046
(<i> hollow, reverberating howl)</i>

721
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:22,555
I have a power failure
in Security, Commander.

722
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,516
Sisko to Odo.

723
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:26,977
Sisko to Odo!

724
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:29,729
All deputies report
to the Security Office.

725
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:30,897
Possible intruder.

726
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:32,440
I'm tracking it.

727
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,651
We have a power drain in
the life support conduit

728
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,194
above the Security Office.

729
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,280
If it's feeding off
our power, we may be
able to slow it down

730
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,908
by shutting off the
primary flow to the
entire core section.

731
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,326
SISKO:
Do it.

732
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,079
Where the hell
did it come from?

733
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:48,165
SECURITY OFFICER:
Security to Ops.
Go ahead.

734
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,749
SECURITY OFFICER:
There's no one
down here, Major.

735
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:51,459
And there's no sign of Odo?

736
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:52,752
SECURITY OFFICER:
No, sir.

737
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:54,713
I can help you
with that, Major.

738
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,341
The creature
you're after<i> is</i> Odo.

739
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:02,012
There must have been some sort
of metamorphic reaction

740
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:04,389
to the volcanic gas that we
encountered on the planet.

741
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,016
Is there any way
to communicate with him?

742
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:07,266
DR. MORA:
I don't know.

743
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,894
It's not Odo, really.

744
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:11,021
It's separate
and independent

745
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:12,939
from the Odo we know,
and yet

746
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:15,150
at the very least,
it's aware of me.

747
00:37:15,192 --> 00:37:16,818
How can you
know that?

748
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:19,988
The incident
in the Science Lab--

749
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,032
I believe that
was an attempt

750
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:25,451
to rescue the life-forms
I placed in containment.

751
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:27,662
The second encounter

752
00:37:27,704 --> 00:37:30,832
occurred in the Infirmary,
where I was asleep.

753
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:33,501
The third happened
just a couple of minutes ago

754
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:36,922
when we got into a heated
discussion in Security.

755
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,844
I think that even
the Constable himself

756
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:46,514
would arrive at the same
conclusions given the evidence.

757
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,894
On some instinctual level...

758
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:55,065
the creature is
familiar with me.

759
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:00,904
We might even conclude it has
hostile intentions toward you.

760
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,989
It had occurred to me.

761
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,574
(<i> beeping</i> )

762
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:06,952
The power shutdown
is complete, Commander.

763
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,870
Odo-- or whatever
it is in there--

764
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:10,538
has stopped moving
for the moment.

765
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,583
Chief, based on
your knowledge
of its behavior

766
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:16,128
if we can lure him out,
is there any way

767
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:18,421
we can we set up
a force field to hold him?

768
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:21,299
We could reverse polarity
on the energy fields.

769
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,676
That might work,
but it's only a guess.

770
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,595
Set it up
on the Promenade.

771
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:27,722
I want a lot of room
to operate.

772
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:31,309
Major, station security teams
along the perimeter.

773
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:34,353
How are we going to get him
to come out of the conduits?

774
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:38,441
Maybe we could use some R-F
energy bursts to attract him.

775
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:40,819
There's only one way

776
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:44,572
that you're going to attract
that creature into your trap.

777
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,827
It's me it's after.

778
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:59,212
SISKO:
Mr. O'Brien?

779
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,797
O'BRIEN:
Our plan seems to be
working, Commander.

780
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,799
He's following my trail
of energy crumbs

781
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,383
directly toward you.

782
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,594
SISKO:
On my signal, open
the conduit and let him in.

783
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,096
O'BRIEN:
Aye, sir.

784
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:09,973
We're not sure
which vent he'll
come through.

785
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:11,308
Hopefully, it will
be the first one

786
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,976
available to him--
over there.

787
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:17,147
SISKO:
If not, there are 17
others he might choose.

788
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:18,982
We're not
stationing officers

789
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:21,567
near any of them.
We don't want to
scare him away.

790
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:23,528
I understand.

791
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:25,822
Just get him
to the force field.

792
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,490
We'll do the rest.

793
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,412
Pass the word
that phasers

794
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,873
are to be set
on maximum stun.

795
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,415
The moment Dr. Mora
appears to be

796
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,043
in jeopardy,
I'll open fire.

797
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,836
Their orders are
to follow my lead.

798
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:42,505
If maximum stun
doesn't bring him
down immediately

799
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:43,923
we set phasers to kill.

800
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:45,091
Commander...

801
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:46,467
I know, Major.

802
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:48,094
Those are my orders.

803
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:57,062
Mr. O'Brien,
we're ready.

804
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,646
Releasing the conduit seal.

805
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:01,941
Dr. Mora, did you
hear that?

806
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:03,318
Ready and waiting.

807
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,697
What are you waiting for?

808
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:52,825
I'm here.

809
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:56,413
And I'm not going anywhere.

I've done it to you again,
haven't I, Odo?

816
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:47,130
Made you a prisoner?

817
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,970
Dear God, what have I done?

818

(<i> howling whoosh</i> )

819
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,774
Mr. O'Brien,
drop the force field.

820
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:08,193

to talk about.

827
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:49,942
I'm not going to try
and explain

828
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,528
what happened
to you, Odo

829
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,905
because I haven't got
the vaguest idea.

830
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,282
I can tell you that
with Dr. Mora's help

831
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:58,951
we've managed to eliminate
all traces of the gas

832
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,745
from your
cellular structure.

833
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,663
I prescribe rest,

834
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:05,124
because it's hard
for a doctor to
go wrong with that one.

835
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:07,210
Otherwise, there's
not much more

836
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:08,627
I can do for you.

837
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:10,838
Thank you, Doctor.

838
00:43:20,432 --> 00:43:21,849
I'm going home.

839
00:43:23,435 --> 00:43:24,977
Dr. Mora...

840
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,901
I want to be sure
you understand...

841
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,071
I had no idea.

842
00:43:36,406 --> 00:43:40,034
You had to speak in a voice
loud enough for me to hear.

843
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:45,706
I'm... sorry.

844
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:49,627
I'm sorry
it was necessary.

845
00:43:53,423 --> 00:43:54,966
I would like...

846
00:43:56,468 --> 00:43:59,596
in a very small way...

847
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,764

850
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,481
From time to time,
we could talk about things

00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:12,691
