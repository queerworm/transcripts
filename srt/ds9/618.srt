1
00:00:02,196 --> 00:00:05,396
Computer, download file
to padd... F-7.

2
00:00:05,435 --> 00:00:06,767
Come on.

3
00:00:06,805 --> 00:00:07,830
Download complete.

4
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:09,206
Thank you! Nurse.

5
00:00:10,245 --> 00:00:12,181
You're up late.

6
00:00:12,216 --> 00:00:13,947
Ah, yes. I've got a few things
to finish up

7
00:00:13,986 --> 00:00:15,181
before I leave in the morning.

8
00:00:15,255 --> 00:00:18,854
I'm, uh, presenting a paper
at a medical conference.

9
00:00:18,896 --> 00:00:20,159
I see.

10
00:00:20,198 --> 00:00:21,291
Where is it?

11
00:00:21,334 --> 00:00:24,329
Risa, Casperia Prime?

12
00:00:24,373 --> 00:00:26,138
Casperia.
How'd you guess?

13
00:00:26,177 --> 00:00:28,545
Well, doctors always hold
their conferences

14
00:00:28,582 --> 00:00:29,550
at sunny resorts.

15
00:00:29,584 --> 00:00:30,984
Ours is a grim profession.

16
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,785
Don't you think
we deserve a break

17
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,224
from all the illness and death?

18
00:00:34,293 --> 00:00:35,488
Mm.

19
00:00:35,529 --> 00:00:38,194
Well, don't forget to take
plenty of sunscreen.

20
00:00:38,234 --> 00:00:39,497
Oh, let me guess.

21
00:00:39,537 --> 00:00:43,409
You dislocated your shoulder.

22
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:44,708
Not again.

23
00:00:44,748 --> 00:00:46,342
Afraid so.

24
00:00:46,384 --> 00:00:47,784
You promised me

25
00:00:47,821 --> 00:00:49,654
that you wouldn't go
kayaking again

26
00:00:49,691 --> 00:00:51,888
until your shoulder
had a chance to heal.

27
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:54,399
I know, but I can't stay away.

28
00:00:54,433 --> 00:00:56,266
It's like the river calls to me.

29
00:00:56,371 --> 00:00:58,000
Yes. It's saying, "Stay away.

30
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:01,207
Don't come near me
or I'll hurt you more!"

31
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:03,417
Ow.

32
00:01:03,451 --> 00:01:04,419
Much better.

33
00:01:04,453 --> 00:01:05,819
It'll be tender

34
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,656
for a few days;
so go easy on it.

35
00:01:07,694 --> 00:01:08,662
Right.

36
00:01:08,696 --> 00:01:10,130
If the pain gets any worse

37
00:01:10,165 --> 00:01:12,328
Nurse Bandee
will give you something.

38
00:01:16,511 --> 00:01:17,774
Thanks, Julian.

39
00:01:17,814 --> 00:01:19,408
Have a good time on Casperia.

40
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,354
I'm going to a medical
conference, not on vacation.

41
00:01:22,389 --> 00:01:23,949
Whatever you say.

42
00:01:23,993 --> 00:01:26,897
And if the river
calls you again, listen to it

43
00:01:26,932 --> 00:01:28,458
and stay away.

44
00:01:37,687 --> 00:01:40,750
The time is 0700 hours.

45
00:01:40,793 --> 00:01:42,888
What?

46
00:01:42,931 --> 00:01:44,798
You're joking.

47
00:01:44,835 --> 00:01:48,001
Computer, confirm time.

48
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:52,847
The time is 0700 hours,
11 seconds.

49
00:01:58,996 --> 00:02:00,328
Something tells me

50
00:02:00,365 --> 00:02:02,962
I'm going to need
a lot of <i>raktajinos</i> today.

51
00:02:07,513 --> 00:02:08,674
Oh.

52
00:02:22,844 --> 00:02:25,280
See you in a few days, old chum.

53
00:02:25,315 --> 00:02:26,749
Keep the home fires burning.

54
00:02:26,785 --> 00:02:28,117
This is the Captain.

55
00:02:28,154 --> 00:02:30,887
All senior officers report
to Operations immediately.

56
00:02:30,927 --> 00:02:32,361
What now?

57
00:02:47,694 --> 00:02:48,992
This better be quick.

58
00:02:49,029 --> 00:02:50,862
I've got a shuttle to catch.

59
00:02:55,743 --> 00:02:56,768
What's going on?

60
00:02:56,812 --> 00:02:58,007
Internal Affairs.

61
00:02:58,047 --> 00:02:59,072
What are they doing here?

62
00:02:59,116 --> 00:03:00,209
They're not saying.

63
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:01,549
If they'd called ahead

64
00:03:01,587 --> 00:03:03,250
we could have thrown
them a party.

65
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:06,092
Yeah, well, something tells me
it's not a social visit.

66
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,223
Where's the Captain?

67
00:03:07,265 --> 00:03:08,563
He's in there.

68
00:03:08,601 --> 00:03:10,833
He doesn't look too happy.

69
00:03:10,873 --> 00:03:12,706
No, he doesn't.

70
00:03:19,223 --> 00:03:21,318
All right, people

71
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,332
this is Deputy Director Sloan
of Internal Affairs.

72
00:03:24,366 --> 00:03:27,668
He's here under the authority
of the Federation Council.

73
00:03:27,706 --> 00:03:32,044
I expect you all to give him
your full cooperation.

74
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,755
Starfleet Intelligence
has reason to believe

75
00:03:36,792 --> 00:03:38,728
that there's been
a security breach

76
00:03:38,762 --> 00:03:39,957
aboard Deep Space 9.

77
00:03:39,998 --> 00:03:41,227
It appears that someone

78
00:03:41,267 --> 00:03:43,966
has been passing information
to the Dominion.

79
00:03:44,006 --> 00:03:45,338
With all due respect

80
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,743
I think there's been
some kind of mistake.

81
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,545
I hope you're right, Commander.

82
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:50,573
I really do

83
00:03:50,618 --> 00:03:53,351
but until we determine
the source

84
00:03:53,391 --> 00:03:56,261
we have to follow standard
containment procedures

85
00:03:56,297 --> 00:03:58,631
and isolate all members
of the senior staff.

86
00:03:58,668 --> 00:04:00,000
As of now

87
00:04:00,038 --> 00:04:03,272
you're all relieved of duty
and confined to quarters.

88
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:05,144
Confined to quarters?

89
00:04:05,181 --> 00:04:07,276
I don't like it
any more than you do.

90
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,810
You'll be contacted shortly.

91
00:04:08,856 --> 00:04:10,587
I'll be conducting interviews
with each one of you.

92
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,025
For the time being

93
00:04:12,062 --> 00:04:14,532
you are not to discuss this
matter amongst yourselves.

94
00:04:14,566 --> 00:04:15,534
Any questions?

95
00:04:15,568 --> 00:04:17,036
Uh, how long do you think

96
00:04:17,072 --> 00:04:19,099
your investigation's
going to take?

97
00:04:19,143 --> 00:04:21,671
That's difficult to say, Doctor,
but don't worry.

98
00:04:21,714 --> 00:04:23,741
We've already informed
Starfleet Medical

99
00:04:23,786 --> 00:04:25,847
that you won't be attending
your conference.

100
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,521
Oh, that's very considerate
of you.

101
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:30,326
Take them to their quarters.

102
00:04:38,314 --> 00:04:40,216
Would you come with me, please?

103
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,977
Hot buttered scones, <i>moba</i> jam,
red leaf tea.

104
00:06:57,021 --> 00:06:58,489
Please.

105
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,524
What's the matter
with this thing?

106
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,601
All right.

107
00:07:19,532 --> 00:07:21,092
Come in.

108
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,877
Would you please come
with me, Doctor?

109
00:07:30,354 --> 00:07:31,583
Uh...

110
00:07:31,656 --> 00:07:33,056
yes.

111
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:35,619
Certainly.

112
00:07:40,474 --> 00:07:41,737
Where are we going?

113
00:07:41,776 --> 00:07:42,835
To the Wardroom.

114
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,715
Director Sloan wants to
ask you a few questions.

115
00:07:49,492 --> 00:07:51,257
Stand clear.

116
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:57,366
What's going on?

117
00:07:57,408 --> 00:07:59,776
Nothing you need
to worry about, sir.

118
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,110
This way.

119
00:08:07,962 --> 00:08:10,262
Dr. Bashir, sir.

120
00:08:14,409 --> 00:08:15,502
Thank you.

121
00:08:21,456 --> 00:08:23,255
Dr. Bashir...

122
00:08:25,531 --> 00:08:27,626
have a seat, please.

123
00:08:27,735 --> 00:08:30,935
I'm sorry you're going to miss
your medical conference.

124
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,535
It couldn't be helped.

125
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:34,069
In a case like this

126
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:35,948
I have to follow
strict procedures.

127
00:08:35,985 --> 00:08:37,978
Yes, I understand.

128
00:08:38,023 --> 00:08:39,788
Maybe it's a blessing
in disguise.

129
00:08:39,826 --> 00:08:42,559
The last time you tried
to attend a medical conference

130
00:08:42,598 --> 00:08:44,898
you were taken prisoner
by the Dominion.

131
00:08:44,936 --> 00:08:47,567
An experience
I wouldn't care to repeat.

132
00:08:47,608 --> 00:08:49,441
I'm sure you wouldn't.

133
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:51,915
What, five weeks
in a Dominion prison camp?

134
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:54,478
I can't imagine
what that must have been like.

135
00:08:54,522 --> 00:08:56,651
Not pleasant.

136
00:08:56,693 --> 00:08:58,993
I read your report.

137
00:08:59,031 --> 00:09:00,294
It made me ask myself

138
00:09:00,334 --> 00:09:02,827
how I would have held up
under those conditions.

139
00:09:02,872 --> 00:09:05,742
I guess you never really know
until you go through it.

140
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:08,248
I'm sure you would have
been able to cope.

141
00:09:08,283 --> 00:09:10,253
We do what we have to
to survive.

142
00:09:10,287 --> 00:09:11,550
Mm-hmm.

143
00:09:11,589 --> 00:09:15,393
I was just reading over
some of your case reports.

144
00:09:15,431 --> 00:09:17,526
Fascinating stuff.

145
00:09:17,568 --> 00:09:20,938
The work you did with those
genetically enhanced patients...

146
00:09:20,974 --> 00:09:22,671
very impressive.

147
00:09:22,745 --> 00:09:23,770
Thank you.

148
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:26,148
Before you started working
with them

149
00:09:26,186 --> 00:09:28,315
Starfleet Medical described them

150
00:09:28,357 --> 00:09:31,261
as "alienated, uncommunicative
and hostile."

151
00:09:31,296 --> 00:09:33,095
And you were the first doctor

152
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:35,900
who managed to establish
a dialogue with them.

153
00:09:35,938 --> 00:09:37,270
Well, actually, I think the fact

154
00:09:37,308 --> 00:09:38,834
that I'm genetically enhanced
myself

155
00:09:38,877 --> 00:09:41,405
made them a little more open
to accepting me.

156
00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:42,712
You spoke their language.

157
00:09:42,818 --> 00:09:43,808
Exactly.

158
00:09:45,424 --> 00:09:48,294
I envy your profession.

159
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:51,734
You have a positive impact
on people's lives.

160
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,865
You know, I...

161
00:09:53,907 --> 00:09:56,970
I considered becoming
a doctor myself.

162
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,812
Ah, you have
a good bedside manner.

163
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:01,852
Actually, when I first came
in here

164
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:04,885
I, uh, half suspected that,
uh, I would be interrogated

165
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:06,455
under a very bright light.

166
00:10:07,902 --> 00:10:09,531
Not this time.

167
00:10:09,572 --> 00:10:13,011
Well, I see no need
to trouble you any longer.

168
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,038
Thank you for your cooperation.

169
00:10:18,657 --> 00:10:19,625
My pleasure.

170
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:24,295
Lieutenant Chandler will take
you back to your quarters now.

171
00:10:24,335 --> 00:10:26,601
Ah, I'm afraid I'm going to have
to ask you to stay there

172
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:28,575
until I've finished
with the rest of the interviews.

173
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:29,635
Well, in that case, maybe you

174
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,546
could send someone
to take a look at my replicator.

175
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:32,551
It's not working.

176
00:10:32,585 --> 00:10:34,817
Actually, we took them off line.

177
00:10:34,889 --> 00:10:37,452
To prevent anyone
from trying to replicate

178
00:10:37,495 --> 00:10:40,092
a communications device
or a weapon.

179
00:10:40,132 --> 00:10:43,970
Oh. Well, I just wanted
some breakfast.

180
00:10:44,007 --> 00:10:45,168
What would you like?

181
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,043
I'll have it sent right up
to your quarters.

182
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,275
Hot buttered scones

183
00:10:48,316 --> 00:10:50,809
<i>moba</i> jam
and some red leaf tea, please.

184
00:10:52,525 --> 00:10:54,222
Coming right up.

185
00:10:54,262 --> 00:10:55,252
Thank you.

186
00:10:56,266 --> 00:10:58,759
Doctor, one more thing.

187
00:10:58,803 --> 00:11:00,773
Those genetically enhanced
patients of yours...

188
00:11:00,807 --> 00:11:03,335
did Starfleet Medical
ask you to work with them

189
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,609
or did you volunteer?

190
00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:05,776
Oh, I volunteered.

191
00:11:05,817 --> 00:11:07,650
I see.

192
00:11:07,688 --> 00:11:08,678
Very good.

193
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,692
Come in.

194
00:11:29,798 --> 00:11:30,891
Here you are, sir.

195
00:11:30,933 --> 00:11:31,901
Thank God.

196
00:11:31,935 --> 00:11:32,994
I'm famished.

197
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,537
Cheers.

198
00:11:36,578 --> 00:11:37,603
Enjoy.

199
00:11:41,989 --> 00:11:43,925
Ugh.

200
00:11:45,596 --> 00:11:47,793
It's a little early for <i>gagh.</i>

201
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:54,872
Well, I hope you're enjoying
my scones, Worf.

202
00:12:51,528 --> 00:12:53,828
Miles, Sloan said we aren't

203
00:12:53,866 --> 00:12:55,095
supposed to be talking
to each other.

204
00:12:55,135 --> 00:12:56,934
I just wanted to make sure
you were all right.

205
00:12:56,972 --> 00:12:58,201
I'm fine, except I think

206
00:12:58,241 --> 00:13:00,507
someone's been snooping
around my quarters.

207
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:01,878
It wouldn't surprise me.

208
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:03,578
Has Sloan questioned you yet?

209
00:13:03,619 --> 00:13:04,587
Yeah, we just finished.

210
00:13:04,621 --> 00:13:05,589
How'd it go?

211
00:13:05,623 --> 00:13:06,613
It went fine.

212
00:13:06,725 --> 00:13:08,752
He just asked me
a few routine questions.

213
00:13:08,796 --> 00:13:10,390
Believe me, it's not fine.

214
00:13:10,433 --> 00:13:12,733
He just grilled me
for over two hours.

215
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:13,738
Two hours?

216
00:13:13,772 --> 00:13:14,797
About what?

217
00:13:14,841 --> 00:13:15,866
About you.

218
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,173
You're joking.

219
00:13:17,212 --> 00:13:18,977
I only wish I were.

220
00:13:19,016 --> 00:13:21,852
Every single question
was about you.

221
00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:23,414
Look, I better go

222
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:25,429
before they trace
this transmission.

223
00:13:25,463 --> 00:13:26,954
I just wanted to warn you
to watch your back.

224
00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:27,989
Miles, wait.

225
00:13:28,034 --> 00:13:30,061
What did he want
to know about me?

226
00:13:30,105 --> 00:13:31,938
Just be careful.
I think they're...

227
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,883
Come in.

228
00:13:41,193 --> 00:13:43,686
Director Sloan
wants to see you.

229
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:44,698
Again?

230
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:46,269
That's right.

231
00:14:22,242 --> 00:14:24,303
Did you get
your breakfast, Doctor?

232
00:14:24,346 --> 00:14:26,077
Yes, I did.

233
00:14:26,117 --> 00:14:28,519
Good.

234
00:14:28,555 --> 00:14:30,718
I was going over my notes
from our last conversation

235
00:14:30,793 --> 00:14:32,125
and there are
a couple of things

236
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,132
I'd like you to clarify.

237
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,134
Oh?

238
00:14:35,168 --> 00:14:36,568
You have a problem with that?

239
00:14:36,605 --> 00:14:38,370
- Not at all.
- Let's go back

240
00:14:38,409 --> 00:14:40,140
to the time you spent
with the Dominion.

241
00:14:40,178 --> 00:14:42,580
I wasn't "with" the Dominion;
I was their prisoner.

242
00:14:42,617 --> 00:14:45,110
You were held
at internment camp 371?

243
00:14:45,155 --> 00:14:46,123
That's right.

244
00:14:46,157 --> 00:14:47,922
- Barrack 6?
- Yes.

245
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,394
You were there for five weeks?

246
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:51,162
37 days, actually.

247
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,261
You're absolutely sure
about that.

248
00:14:53,304 --> 00:14:54,294
Yes.

249
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:57,004
And General Martok
was with you in Barrack 6.

250
00:14:57,045 --> 00:14:58,947
Correct.

251
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:01,613
He said that the Jem'Hadar
removed you from the barracks.

252
00:15:01,655 --> 00:15:03,852
I complained
when they cut our rations

253
00:15:03,892 --> 00:15:05,623
so they threw me in solitary.

254
00:15:05,663 --> 00:15:07,029
I see.

255
00:15:07,065 --> 00:15:10,037
And did you meet with anyone
during that week?

256
00:15:10,071 --> 00:15:12,007
I was alone.

257
00:15:12,042 --> 00:15:13,602
You're sure about that.

258
00:15:13,645 --> 00:15:14,977
Wait.

259
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,847
Um, let me think.

260
00:15:18,254 --> 00:15:20,281
Was I alone in solitary?

261
00:15:20,325 --> 00:15:21,657
Yes.

262
00:15:21,695 --> 00:15:24,165
I think I was.

263
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:26,465
You didn't meet with a Vorta?

264
00:15:26,505 --> 00:15:27,473
No.

265
00:15:27,507 --> 00:15:28,532
Or a changeling?

266
00:15:28,575 --> 00:15:29,770
No.

267
00:15:29,844 --> 00:15:31,107
So what you're telling me

268
00:15:31,146 --> 00:15:33,639
is you spent seven days
in complete isolation.

269
00:15:33,685 --> 00:15:35,017
It wasn't seven days.

270
00:15:35,054 --> 00:15:36,454
It was five... five days.

271
00:15:36,491 --> 00:15:38,654
Now that's odd 'cause
General Martok said

272
00:15:38,695 --> 00:15:40,163
you were gone for seven days.

273
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:41,758
He was wrong.
It was five.

274
00:15:41,801 --> 00:15:44,932
Why would he lie
about something like that?

275
00:15:44,974 --> 00:15:45,942
He wasn't lying.

276
00:15:45,976 --> 00:15:47,205
You can't both be right.

277
00:15:47,245 --> 00:15:49,147
He must have lost count
of the days.

278
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:51,015
He was under a great deal
of stress.

279
00:15:51,053 --> 00:15:52,112
And you weren't?

280
00:15:52,155 --> 00:15:54,455
Human beings are more adaptable

281
00:15:54,494 --> 00:15:57,091
to incarceration than Klingons.

282
00:15:57,132 --> 00:16:00,104
Especially when they're
genetically engineered?

283
00:16:00,138 --> 00:16:02,108
Meaning what?

284
00:16:02,142 --> 00:16:05,137
Let's move on
to the matter of your escape

285
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:06,206
from the camp.

286
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,117
I'll quote from your own report.

287
00:16:08,154 --> 00:16:11,217
"We constructed a transmitter
using components

288
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,492
"from the barracks
life-support system.

289
00:16:13,532 --> 00:16:15,502
"We used it
to contact our runabout

290
00:16:15,536 --> 00:16:17,529
and beam ourselves
out of the camp."

291
00:16:17,573 --> 00:16:19,064
Now forgive me, Doctor.

292
00:16:19,109 --> 00:16:21,637
That sounds
a little hard to believe.

293
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:23,081
It's what happened.

294
00:16:23,117 --> 00:16:25,782
Why would the Dominion
leave your runabout

295
00:16:25,823 --> 00:16:27,656
orbiting the camp unattended?

296
00:16:27,693 --> 00:16:29,686
They didn't think
we'd be able to contact it.

297
00:16:29,731 --> 00:16:31,097
Why not?

298
00:16:31,133 --> 00:16:34,503
They left you everything
you need to build a transmitter.

299
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,476
Isn't it more plausible

300
00:16:36,511 --> 00:16:38,708
that the Dominion
wanted you to escape?

301
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:39,774
Why?

302
00:16:39,817 --> 00:16:41,946
Why would they do that?

303
00:16:41,988 --> 00:16:44,117
So that you could start working
for them.

304
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:46,061
But I'm not working for them.

305
00:16:46,096 --> 00:16:47,690
How can you be sure?

306
00:16:47,733 --> 00:16:49,327
Excuse me?

307
00:16:49,369 --> 00:16:53,139
How can you be sure
you're not working for them?

308
00:16:53,177 --> 00:16:57,584
Are you familiar with the term
"engramatic dissociation"?

309
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,849
Vaguely.

310
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:01,382
The theory holds
that if a person's mind

311
00:17:01,427 --> 00:17:03,260
is sufficiently disciplined

312
00:17:03,297 --> 00:17:05,631
he'd be capable
of compartmentalizing

313
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:08,573
contradictory information,
believing one thing

314
00:17:08,608 --> 00:17:09,940
while doing another.

315
00:17:09,977 --> 00:17:13,747
I think you possess
that kind of mind.

316
00:17:13,785 --> 00:17:15,721
I think the Dominion saw that

317
00:17:15,756 --> 00:17:17,122
and decided
to take advantage of it.

318
00:17:17,158 --> 00:17:21,064
I think they broke you
and turned you to their cause

319
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,368
and then had you suppress
the memory of what happened.

320
00:17:24,406 --> 00:17:27,776
You're saying I'm a Dominion spy
and don't even know it.

321
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,213
What could be more perfect?

322
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:31,242
There's no chance
of you getting caught

323
00:17:31,286 --> 00:17:34,190
because you don't even realize
you're working for them.

324
00:17:34,226 --> 00:17:35,524
When they want to debrief you

325
00:17:35,562 --> 00:17:37,156
all they do
is trigger your memory.

326
00:17:37,198 --> 00:17:38,724
That's ridiculous.

327
00:17:38,769 --> 00:17:42,504
Doctor, I am trying to help you

328
00:17:42,542 --> 00:17:44,409
but I need your cooperation.

329
00:17:44,446 --> 00:17:47,646
I need you to tear down
the walls inside your mind

330
00:17:47,686 --> 00:17:50,122
to dredge up
a fragment of a memory...

331
00:17:50,158 --> 00:17:53,130
anything about your mission,
about your contacts.

332
00:17:53,164 --> 00:17:55,761
I know it's not easy,
but you've got to try.

333
00:17:56,971 --> 00:17:59,203
There are no memories
to dredge up.

334
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:04,110
I'm not suffering
from engramatic dissociation.

335
00:18:04,152 --> 00:18:06,885
I'm a loyal Starfleet officer.

336
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,894
And will not answer
any more questions

337
00:18:08,995 --> 00:18:11,090
unless I'm formally
charged and can respond

338
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:12,328
with the benefit of counsel!

339
00:18:12,368 --> 00:18:14,600
I've had enough of your lies,
Doctor!

340
00:18:15,709 --> 00:18:17,645
You think you're smarter
than the rest of us, don't you?

341
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,648
You think you're smarter

342
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:20,082
than the millions
of brave men and women

343
00:18:20,117 --> 00:18:22,280
who put their lives on the line
for the Federation.

344
00:18:22,322 --> 00:18:25,522
You want to do things
the hard way? Fine.

345
00:18:25,561 --> 00:18:27,121
But I'm going to get
the truth out of you

346
00:18:27,165 --> 00:18:30,262
and when I'm done, I'm going
to take whatever's left of you

347
00:18:30,304 --> 00:18:31,864
and I'm going to lock it away.

348
00:18:31,908 --> 00:18:33,571
Guards!

349
00:18:48,438 --> 00:18:49,701
Is it really necessary

350
00:18:49,741 --> 00:18:52,975
to drag a Starfleet officer
across the Promenade in irons?

351
00:18:53,014 --> 00:18:55,041
We have our orders, sir.

352
00:18:55,085 --> 00:18:56,918
Please stand aside.

353
00:18:56,956 --> 00:18:58,117
We'll get you out of this,
Julian.

354
00:18:58,158 --> 00:19:00,128
I'm sure this is all a mistake.

355
00:19:00,162 --> 00:19:01,688
Is it?

356
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,960
Where's Odo?

357
00:19:21,004 --> 00:19:22,199
In his quarters.

358
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,732
We'll be handling security
for the time being.

359
00:19:24,778 --> 00:19:25,837
This way.

360
00:19:40,575 --> 00:19:41,565
Too tight?

361
00:19:41,611 --> 00:19:42,579
A bit.

362
00:19:42,613 --> 00:19:43,774
You'll live.

363
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:47,152
Oh, so nice to see you
enjoying your work.

364
00:19:48,793 --> 00:19:50,456
I was with the Seventh Fleet

365
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:53,262
when the Dominion
attacked the Tyra system.

366
00:19:53,301 --> 00:19:56,000
98 of our ships were destroyed
in a matter of hours.

367
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,703
I lost a lot of friends.

368
00:19:57,744 --> 00:19:58,939
I lost a lot of friends, too.

369
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,948
I believe that

370
00:19:59,982 --> 00:20:02,316
but yours were Jem'Hadar.

371
00:20:02,353 --> 00:20:04,687
You won't be needing
this anymore.

372
00:20:04,725 --> 00:20:06,125
Step inside.

373
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:20,412
With all due respect, Captain

374
00:20:20,455 --> 00:20:22,288
if you would just wait
in the Security Office

375
00:20:22,326 --> 00:20:23,886
Director Sloan
should be here any minute

376
00:20:23,929 --> 00:20:25,694
and you can discuss
your request with him...

377
00:20:25,733 --> 00:20:26,860
There is nothing to discuss.

378
00:20:26,902 --> 00:20:29,168
I want ten minutes
alone with my officer

379
00:20:29,206 --> 00:20:30,401
and I want them now.

380
00:20:30,442 --> 00:20:32,002
Very well.

381
00:20:38,091 --> 00:20:40,961
I thought you should know,
Odo did some checking.

382
00:20:40,997 --> 00:20:43,399
Sloan had a son in Starfleet.

383
00:20:43,435 --> 00:20:44,926
He was a transport pilot.

384
00:20:44,971 --> 00:20:47,602
He was killed
by a Dominion patrol.

385
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:50,874
Maybe he thinks I supplied
them with the information

386
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:53,514
that helped them target
his son's ship.

387
00:20:53,555 --> 00:20:55,184
That's exactly what I think.

388
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:03,039
When my son's convoy
dropped out of warp

389
00:21:03,074 --> 00:21:05,203
to rendezvous
with a Klingon bird-of-prey

390
00:21:05,245 --> 00:21:07,340
they found
three Dominion attack ships

391
00:21:07,382 --> 00:21:09,648
waiting for them instead.

392
00:21:09,687 --> 00:21:12,180
I'm sorry for your loss.

393
00:21:12,226 --> 00:21:15,460
But don't you think that
your son's death indicates

394
00:21:15,499 --> 00:21:18,403
a conflict of interest
in your investigation?

395
00:21:18,438 --> 00:21:21,740
No, I think it gives me
an added incentive

396
00:21:21,777 --> 00:21:23,610
to go after the truth.

397
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,017
Now, what was it you wanted?

398
00:21:26,053 --> 00:21:27,021
I need to talk

399
00:21:27,055 --> 00:21:29,822
to my Chief Medical Officer
in private.

400
00:21:29,861 --> 00:21:31,694
I can understand that.

401
00:21:33,434 --> 00:21:34,527
But security protocol

402
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:36,733
requires that no one
talk to the prisoner

403
00:21:36,774 --> 00:21:38,208
without clearance from me.

404
00:21:38,244 --> 00:21:41,877
Director Sloan, have you
received orders from Starfleet

405
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,219
to relieve me of my command
of this station?

406
00:21:44,256 --> 00:21:45,724
No, I haven't.

407
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:48,390
Well, then, as long
as I remain in command

408
00:21:48,431 --> 00:21:50,994
I will see Dr. Bashir
whenever I please.

409
00:21:51,037 --> 00:21:52,198
Furthermore, from now on

410
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:54,573
I will sit in on all
interrogation sessions

411
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,637
to make sure
his rights are observed.

412
00:21:56,681 --> 00:21:58,275
Do I make myself clear?

413
00:21:59,921 --> 00:22:01,686
I believe so.

414
00:22:03,027 --> 00:22:05,897
Well, we'll see
each other tomorrow.

415
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:08,632
In the meantime,
enjoy your conversation.

416
00:22:16,687 --> 00:22:19,750
I appreciate your help, sir.

417
00:22:19,793 --> 00:22:22,093
We'll get this straightened out.

418
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,623
I promise you.

419
00:22:27,476 --> 00:22:31,644
Let's go back a few years
to the incident at Bopak III.

420
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:35,155
According to your report,
you and Chief O'Brien

421
00:22:35,191 --> 00:22:36,659
crash-landed on the planet

422
00:22:36,727 --> 00:22:39,893
where you then made contact
with a group of Jem'Hadar.

423
00:22:39,934 --> 00:22:41,665
We didn't make contact
with them.

424
00:22:41,704 --> 00:22:42,865
They captured us.

425
00:22:42,907 --> 00:22:44,205
Well, if that's the case

426
00:22:44,243 --> 00:22:46,110
why didn't you
attempt to escape?

427
00:22:46,147 --> 00:22:47,479
We didn't have a chance.

428
00:22:47,516 --> 00:22:49,782
According to Chief O'Brien

429
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:53,054
you were more interested
in curing the Jem'Hadar

430
00:22:53,094 --> 00:22:55,587
of their addiction
to ketracel-white.

431
00:22:55,632 --> 00:22:56,998
I'm a doctor.

432
00:22:57,035 --> 00:22:58,698
They were suffering
from withdrawal.

433
00:22:58,771 --> 00:23:00,205
They're the enemy...

434
00:23:00,241 --> 00:23:02,872
genetically engineered
killing machines.

435
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:04,348
They're not machines.

436
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,612
They're sentient beings

437
00:23:05,652 --> 00:23:07,645
and I couldn't just stand there
and watch them die.

438
00:23:07,756 --> 00:23:10,660
Why? Because you felt sympathy
for them

439
00:23:10,762 --> 00:23:13,232
being genetically engineered
yourself?

440
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:15,066
This is irrelevant.

441
00:23:15,105 --> 00:23:17,234
We're talking about an incident
that happened

442
00:23:17,275 --> 00:23:19,768
before Dr. Bashir allegedly
became a Dominion agent.

443
00:23:19,813 --> 00:23:21,111
It's not irrelevant, Captain.

444
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,450
If anything, it shows
he was already sympathetic

445
00:23:23,488 --> 00:23:24,683
to the Dominion.

446
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,088
But let's move on.

447
00:23:26,127 --> 00:23:27,960
Doctor, we spoke yesterday

448
00:23:27,997 --> 00:23:31,265
about a group
of genetically enhanced patients

449
00:23:31,303 --> 00:23:33,205
that you brought to the station.

450
00:23:33,241 --> 00:23:36,680
Why exactly did you decide
to work with them?

451
00:23:36,714 --> 00:23:39,242
They'd been institutionalized
most of their lives.

452
00:23:39,286 --> 00:23:40,880
I thought I might find a way

453
00:23:40,923 --> 00:23:42,984
to help them assimilate
into society.

454
00:23:43,027 --> 00:23:44,359
A laudable goal.

455
00:23:44,396 --> 00:23:47,197
What I find puzzling
is the way you went about it.

456
00:23:47,235 --> 00:23:50,298
These misfits had been sheltered
from the outside world

457
00:23:50,341 --> 00:23:52,368
for as long as they
could remember.

458
00:23:52,412 --> 00:23:55,248
Yet you chose
to bombard them with information

459
00:23:55,285 --> 00:23:57,084
about the war with the Dominion.

460
00:23:57,122 --> 00:23:59,456
Now, frankly, I'm surprised

461
00:23:59,493 --> 00:24:02,021
it didn't scare them
into a deeper isolation.

462
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:03,932
I wanted to engage them.

463
00:24:03,969 --> 00:24:05,335
And it worked.

464
00:24:05,371 --> 00:24:07,705
Is that why
you convinced Starfleet Command

465
00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:10,713
to give them access
to classified battle plans?

466
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,150
Starfleet was interested
in hearing our ideas

467
00:24:13,187 --> 00:24:14,713
on how to win the war.

468
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,156
How to win the war.

469
00:24:16,193 --> 00:24:19,529
You recommended
that the Federation surrender.

470
00:24:19,566 --> 00:24:22,367
We were looking for ways to save
as many lives as possible.

471
00:24:22,405 --> 00:24:25,571
Now, if you'd take the time
to examine the findings!

472
00:24:25,612 --> 00:24:26,739
Captain, you took the time

473
00:24:26,814 --> 00:24:28,545
to examine the findings,
didn't you?

474
00:24:30,722 --> 00:24:31,951
I did.

475
00:24:31,992 --> 00:24:33,757
And did you agree with them?

476
00:24:34,796 --> 00:24:35,764
No.

477
00:24:35,832 --> 00:24:37,358
Of course not.

478
00:24:37,402 --> 00:24:39,770
No loyal Starfleet
officer could.

479
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,707
I won't deny that Doctor Bashir

480
00:24:41,744 --> 00:24:43,771
has made
some questionable decisions

481
00:24:43,848 --> 00:24:46,148
in his career,
but that's a long way

482
00:24:46,186 --> 00:24:48,783
from convincing me
that he is a traitor.

483
00:24:48,824 --> 00:24:50,691
Now, so far, your case is based

484
00:24:50,728 --> 00:24:52,960
on circumstantial
evidence and speculation.

485
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,402
What other kind of case
can I make against a man

486
00:24:55,438 --> 00:24:56,736
who covers his tracks so well?

487
00:24:56,774 --> 00:24:59,644
That's a circular argument,
and you know it!

488
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,413
Captain, if Dr. Bashir
had been involved

489
00:25:02,452 --> 00:25:04,649
in one or two
questionable incidents

490
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:07,457
I could understand how you
might be able to dismiss it

491
00:25:07,495 --> 00:25:09,226
but the sheer number
of incidents

492
00:25:09,266 --> 00:25:11,759
form a pattern of behavior
that can't be ignored.

493
00:25:11,804 --> 00:25:15,335
I understand that you want
to be loyal to a man

494
00:25:15,378 --> 00:25:17,177
who's served under you
for so long.

495
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:19,880
I understand you'd be inclined
to take his word

496
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,651
over that of an outsider.

497
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:25,528
But step back for a moment
and think about it.

498
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,125
This man concealed the truth

499
00:25:27,168 --> 00:25:29,229
about his illegal
genetic enhancement

500
00:25:29,272 --> 00:25:30,672
for over 30 years.

501
00:25:30,708 --> 00:25:34,078
He lied to get
his medical license.

502
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:36,484
He lied to get into Starfleet.

503
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,683
He lied to you when he
came aboard this station

504
00:25:38,724 --> 00:25:40,523
and he's been lying
to you ever since.

505
00:25:43,434 --> 00:25:46,999
He did eventually
come forward...

506
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:48,066
and tell the truth.

507
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:50,478
That's right, he did. Why?

508
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:53,419
Why? What made you confess?

509
00:25:53,454 --> 00:25:54,615
Was it because you realized

510
00:25:54,656 --> 00:25:57,423
that it was your duty to be
honest with your Captain?

511
00:25:57,462 --> 00:25:58,521
No.

512
00:25:58,564 --> 00:25:59,657
Was it because you felt guilty

513
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,963
for having lied to him
for so long?

514
00:26:01,002 --> 00:26:01,799
No.

515
00:26:01,904 --> 00:26:03,430
Then why did you come forward?

516
00:26:03,474 --> 00:26:04,908
I was found out.

517
00:26:04,943 --> 00:26:06,572
And if you hadn't been found out

518
00:26:06,613 --> 00:26:11,453
would you have come forward and
told your Captain the truth...

519
00:26:17,135 --> 00:26:18,729
ever?

520
00:26:20,274 --> 00:26:22,574
I don't know.

521
00:26:22,612 --> 00:26:25,413
I see.

522
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,754
Sloan was right
about one thing, sir.

523
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,253
I should have told you the
truth from the beginning.

524
00:26:48,297 --> 00:26:49,265
You're right.

525
00:26:49,299 --> 00:26:51,030
You should have.

526
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:54,234
But let's put that
behind us for now.

527
00:26:54,276 --> 00:26:56,907
How can I defend myself
to this man?

528
00:26:56,947 --> 00:26:58,415
Whatever I say to him

529
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:02,185
he either thinks I'm lying
or repressing my memories.

530
00:27:02,225 --> 00:27:03,888
I know you're not lying, Julian.

531
00:27:05,765 --> 00:27:07,097
But?

532
00:27:07,135 --> 00:27:10,198
But... as a doctor

533
00:27:10,241 --> 00:27:13,008
isn't it in the realm
of medical possibility

534
00:27:13,046 --> 00:27:15,039
that the Dominion
did recruit you

535
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:17,417
and you have blocked it
out of your memory?

536
00:27:17,455 --> 00:27:21,259
Well, even if it is possible,
it didn't happen.

537
00:27:24,169 --> 00:27:25,866
You don't believe me, do you?

538
00:27:25,905 --> 00:27:27,396
I don't...

539
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,276
I don't think you're lying,
Julian.

540
00:27:37,629 --> 00:27:39,097
It's late.

541
00:27:39,131 --> 00:27:40,497
Try to get some sleep.

542
00:27:42,505 --> 00:27:44,805
We'll talk again in the morning.

543
00:28:03,593 --> 00:28:06,258
Sorry to interrupt your sleep,
Doctor.

544
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:09,032
Looks like you're going on
a little vacation after all.

545
00:28:09,071 --> 00:28:11,564
Where are you taking me?

546
00:28:11,609 --> 00:28:13,772
Starbase 53
for further questioning.

547
00:28:13,814 --> 00:28:15,545
Does Captain Sisko
know about this?

548
00:28:15,584 --> 00:28:18,112
It's none of his concern.

549
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:19,384
Not anymore.

550
00:28:19,425 --> 00:28:22,625
You have no right to do this,
Sloan.

551
00:28:22,665 --> 00:28:23,997
Oh, but I do.

552
00:28:24,034 --> 00:28:28,772
Starfleet Special Order 66715
gives me the authority

553
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:32,580
to neutralize security threats
to Deep Space 9

554
00:28:32,618 --> 00:28:35,054
by whatever means necessary.

555
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:38,995
Doctor, you're about to spend
the rest of this war

556
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:42,697
in a maximum-security cell...

557
00:28:42,738 --> 00:28:44,104
unless...

558
00:28:44,141 --> 00:28:46,304
you would care to put

559
00:28:46,346 --> 00:28:49,648
your thumbprint
on this confession.

560
00:28:49,685 --> 00:28:54,252
We can reword it if it doesn't
meet your exacting standards.

561
00:28:54,295 --> 00:28:56,424
You can take that confession

562
00:28:56,466 --> 00:28:59,495
and throw it
out of the nearest airlock.

563
00:29:00,707 --> 00:29:02,734
I thought so.

564
00:29:02,778 --> 00:29:05,375
Take him to the shuttle.

565
00:29:09,525 --> 00:29:11,552
Would you put your hands
in front of you, Doctor?

566
00:29:11,596 --> 00:29:13,691
He's beaming out!

567
00:29:13,733 --> 00:29:14,666
Stop him!

568
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:23,916
Good evening, Doctor.

569
00:29:23,987 --> 00:29:25,353
Weyoun?

570
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,189
Welcome home.

571
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:37,407
It would appear we got
you out just in time.

572
00:29:37,448 --> 00:29:38,746
It's all right.

573
00:29:38,783 --> 00:29:40,946
You're among friends now.

574
00:29:41,054 --> 00:29:42,215
Did they mistreat you?

575
00:29:42,257 --> 00:29:43,691
I don't see any bruises.

576
00:29:43,727 --> 00:29:45,959
Why did you bring me here?

577
00:29:46,064 --> 00:29:48,466
What choice did I have?

578
00:29:48,503 --> 00:29:51,373
Starfleet discovered
you were working for us.

579
00:29:51,409 --> 00:29:53,902
I'm not working for you.

580
00:29:53,947 --> 00:29:56,281
I'm not a Dominion spy.

581
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:01,591
You actually believe that,
don't you?

582
00:30:01,629 --> 00:30:03,997
That's why you're
such a good operative.

583
00:30:04,067 --> 00:30:05,467
You're lying.

584
00:30:07,173 --> 00:30:08,733
Oh, here we go again.

585
00:30:10,314 --> 00:30:12,580
These little conversations
of ours

586
00:30:12,618 --> 00:30:16,149
always follow
the same pattern:

587
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:19,027
You start out confused;
then you get angry;

588
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,724
then you deny everything

589
00:30:20,767 --> 00:30:24,035
until finally the walls
inside your mind

590
00:30:24,074 --> 00:30:27,946
start to break down
and you accept the truth.

591
00:30:27,982 --> 00:30:29,416
What truth?

592
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:31,684
That you broke me
in your prison camp?

593
00:30:31,723 --> 00:30:34,251
We're not barbarians.

594
00:30:34,294 --> 00:30:36,925
There was no torture involved.

595
00:30:36,966 --> 00:30:39,904
We simply helped you
to see that there's

596
00:30:39,939 --> 00:30:43,811
no way Starfleet
can defeat the Dominion

597
00:30:43,847 --> 00:30:45,076
and because you didn't want

598
00:30:45,182 --> 00:30:48,177
billions of Federation citizens
to lose their lives needlessly

599
00:30:48,222 --> 00:30:50,522
you agreed to provide us
with information

600
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,792
that would help us
end this war quickly.

601
00:30:52,831 --> 00:30:56,201
You rose above
the petty question

602
00:30:56,238 --> 00:30:59,005
of whose side you were on
and made...

603
00:30:59,044 --> 00:31:01,412
a moral decision.

604
00:31:03,453 --> 00:31:05,423
It's not surprising, really.

605
00:31:05,457 --> 00:31:07,927
After all, you are a doctor.

606
00:31:07,961 --> 00:31:10,056
You're saying
that I'm a traitor?

607
00:31:10,099 --> 00:31:13,538
Traitor, hero...

608
00:31:13,573 --> 00:31:15,805
those are just words.

609
00:31:15,844 --> 00:31:20,479
Oh, your friends on Deep Space 9
may vilify you, but history...

610
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:24,085
will judge you
to be a great man

611
00:31:24,194 --> 00:31:26,927
a visionary
who helped bring an end

612
00:31:26,966 --> 00:31:28,629
to one
of the most devastating wars

613
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:30,401
the galaxy has ever seen.

614
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,876
I-I don't remember.

615
00:31:32,911 --> 00:31:34,402
I don't remember any of it.

616
00:31:34,448 --> 00:31:35,882
Of course not.

617
00:31:35,917 --> 00:31:38,319
You suppressed the memories...

618
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:40,052
compartmentalized them.

619
00:31:40,092 --> 00:31:42,494
It's a remarkable ability,
but it does make

620
00:31:42,531 --> 00:31:45,560
these initial conversations
a bit wearing.

621
00:31:48,342 --> 00:31:49,810
Have something to eat.

622
00:31:49,845 --> 00:31:53,649
You always reintegrate better
on a full stomach.

623
00:31:57,093 --> 00:32:00,361
Do you remember
when I first offered you scones?

624
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:01,731
Back at the camp.

625
00:32:01,769 --> 00:32:02,794
No.

626
00:32:04,542 --> 00:32:06,341
Concentrate.

627
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:11,913
Sensory details are the key.

628
00:32:14,461 --> 00:32:17,992
I had you brought in
from solitary.

629
00:32:18,035 --> 00:32:21,064
You were very hungry,
but you refused to give me

630
00:32:21,107 --> 00:32:24,477
the satisfaction
of seeing you eat.

631
00:32:26,084 --> 00:32:28,681
Do you remember?

632
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,086
I don't remember...

633
00:32:32,129 --> 00:32:35,260
because it never happened!

634
00:32:35,302 --> 00:32:36,828
You were almost there.

635
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:38,101
Try again.

636
00:32:38,141 --> 00:32:40,669
With a little more effort,
you can break through.

637
00:32:40,714 --> 00:32:41,977
I'm not a Dominion spy!

638
00:32:42,016 --> 00:32:43,484
I can see this is going to be

639
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,284
one of our
more difficult sessions.

640
00:32:45,322 --> 00:32:48,192
I'm innocent. I don't care
what you or Sloan think.

641
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,771
Wait a minute.

642
00:32:55,844 --> 00:33:01,014
Why would you both be trying
to convince me of the same lie

643
00:33:01,054 --> 00:33:03,286
unless...

644
00:33:03,325 --> 00:33:05,591
you were working together?

645
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:07,293
Please, Doctor

646
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:09,132
listen to yourself.

647
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:11,299
Sloan's the traitor.

648
00:33:11,341 --> 00:33:12,468
Combat stations.

649
00:33:12,511 --> 00:33:13,843
Enemy ship approaching.

650
00:33:22,196 --> 00:33:23,722
Sisko.

651
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:29,009
I'm afraid we're going
to have to continue

652
00:33:29,043 --> 00:33:30,534
your debriefing later.

653
00:33:58,201 --> 00:33:59,864
Am I glad to see you.

654
00:33:59,905 --> 00:34:01,875
Away team to the <i>Defiant.</i>
We got him.

655
00:34:08,155 --> 00:34:10,625
I suppose you have
a reasonable explanation

656
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,628
for why the Dominion

657
00:34:11,662 --> 00:34:13,096
broke you out
of that holding cell.

658
00:34:13,131 --> 00:34:14,862
I understand
how this must look, sir.

659
00:34:14,902 --> 00:34:16,029
What did they want?

660
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,095
Weyoun just tried

661
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,938
to convince me
that I was his operative.

662
00:34:18,976 --> 00:34:20,741
I think he and Sloan
are working together.

663
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,839
Now that's enough.

664
00:34:21,882 --> 00:34:23,545
You know you're not going
to exonerate yourself

665
00:34:23,586 --> 00:34:24,952
by casting suspicions
on someone else.

666
00:34:24,988 --> 00:34:26,479
Well, maybe he's not a traitor.

667
00:34:26,524 --> 00:34:28,494
Maybe he's been replaced
by a changeling.

668
00:34:28,528 --> 00:34:29,553
All I'm saying is

669
00:34:29,598 --> 00:34:31,761
that both he and Weyoun
are trying to frame me.

670
00:34:31,802 --> 00:34:33,669
You have run out of excuses,
Doctor.

671
00:34:33,706 --> 00:34:35,938
You have to believe me.

672
00:34:35,977 --> 00:34:36,945
I'm innocent.

673
00:34:36,979 --> 00:34:39,108
I have had enough
of your lies, Doctor.

674
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,618
You can't just dismiss
what I'm saying.

675
00:34:40,653 --> 00:34:42,019
Because if I'm right,
there's no telling

676
00:34:42,056 --> 00:34:43,251
what kind of damage
Sloan can do...

677
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:44,520
Get him off my Bridge!

678
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,721
Let's go, Doctor.

679
00:34:45,763 --> 00:34:48,165
Jadzia, you believe me,
don't you?

680
00:34:48,201 --> 00:34:50,194
Why did you do it, Julian?

681
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,106
Miles? You?

682
00:34:54,815 --> 00:34:56,614
Your shoulder...

683
00:34:56,652 --> 00:34:58,178
it's all right?

684
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,450
Of course, it's all right.

685
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:01,960
But you dislocated it
yesterday when...

686
00:35:03,532 --> 00:35:06,129
we were playing springball.

687
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,333
So? It's better now.

688
00:35:09,343 --> 00:35:11,609
You didn't hurt it
playing springball.

689
00:35:11,649 --> 00:35:14,587
You dislocated it kayaking

690
00:35:14,621 --> 00:35:15,680
in a holosuite.

691
00:35:19,998 --> 00:35:21,227
You're not Miles.

692
00:35:26,578 --> 00:35:28,775
And you're not Captain Sisko.

693
00:35:28,816 --> 00:35:31,583
He'd at least be
willing to hear me out.

694
00:35:34,795 --> 00:35:36,560
This isn't real.

695
00:35:36,598 --> 00:35:38,363
It can't be.

696
00:35:41,574 --> 00:35:43,100
You're right, Doctor.

697
00:35:43,144 --> 00:35:44,237
None of it was real.

698
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,648
But I am

699
00:35:46,685 --> 00:35:48,951
and this isn't over.

700
00:35:55,925 --> 00:35:57,554
Congratulations, Doctor.

701
00:35:57,594 --> 00:36:00,498
It's not often
that we're proven wrong.

702
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,400
I take it you finally believe

703
00:36:02,437 --> 00:36:04,168
I'm not working
for the Dominion.

704
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:07,044
I'm leaning heavily
in that direction

705
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,550
but to erase
any lingering doubts

706
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:12,055
what do you say we make
one final test?

707
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:14,687
I've finished playing games
with you, Sloan!

708
00:36:14,729 --> 00:36:17,360
I can assure you, Doctor,
this is no game.

709
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:25,547
Don't be afraid.

710
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,416
I have no intentions
of hurting you.

711
00:36:27,454 --> 00:36:30,585
I just need to remove an implant
from behind your right ear.

712
00:36:30,627 --> 00:36:32,927
I tell you what.

713
00:36:32,965 --> 00:36:34,559
Why don't you do the honors?

714
00:36:34,601 --> 00:36:36,628
Give it to him.

715
00:36:37,674 --> 00:36:38,972
Go ahead, Doctor.

716
00:36:39,011 --> 00:36:41,277
It's only
a neurosynaptic relay.

717
00:36:41,315 --> 00:36:44,378
You've been recording my
neuro-electric responses.

718
00:36:44,421 --> 00:36:45,480
That's correct.

719
00:36:45,523 --> 00:36:47,550
And now I'd like
to check the findings

720
00:36:47,594 --> 00:36:49,962
in order to confirm
what I already believe...

721
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,525
that you're an innocent man.

722
00:36:51,569 --> 00:36:54,803
Now, either you remove the relay
or we will.

723
00:37:10,841 --> 00:37:12,811
Thank you.

724
00:37:12,845 --> 00:37:15,213
This'll only take a moment.

725
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:17,550
Take your time.

726
00:37:17,587 --> 00:37:20,320
I don't seem
to be going anywhere.

727
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,491
I'm glad to see your sense
of humor's returning.

728
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:25,162
That's a very good sign.

729
00:37:25,203 --> 00:37:26,671
Of what?

730
00:37:26,705 --> 00:37:28,641
You're beginning to relax.

731
00:37:28,676 --> 00:37:31,671
We subjected you
to high levels of stress

732
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:34,185
to ensure accurate test results

733
00:37:34,221 --> 00:37:37,523
and I'm glad to say
the results are in your favor.

734
00:37:37,561 --> 00:37:42,230
Your loyalty to the Federation
appears to be above reproach.

735
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:45,709
Why do I still detect a hint
of doubt in your voice?

736
00:37:45,778 --> 00:37:48,112
Well, frankly,
I would have preferred

737
00:37:48,149 --> 00:37:51,087
to have kept you under
observation a little longer.

738
00:37:51,121 --> 00:37:54,355
Unfortunately, we didn't know
about Chief O'Brien's injury

739
00:37:54,394 --> 00:37:57,298
or we would have incorporated
that into the program.

740
00:37:57,334 --> 00:37:59,031
So you beamed me
out of my quarters

741
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:01,041
into this holosuite
when I was asleep.

742
00:38:02,077 --> 00:38:04,605
I believe we allowed you
a full hour.

743
00:38:04,648 --> 00:38:07,415
No wonder I feel so tired.

744
00:38:08,656 --> 00:38:11,184
I suppose you find your subjects
more malleable

745
00:38:11,228 --> 00:38:13,289
when they have been deprived
of sleep.

746
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:15,165
Not a new technique, I admit

747
00:38:15,203 --> 00:38:17,435
but an effective
one nonetheless.

748
00:38:17,474 --> 00:38:21,414
So... why don't you tell me
who you are?

749
00:38:21,448 --> 00:38:23,645
Who you work for?

750
00:38:23,686 --> 00:38:25,349
I think it's obvious.

751
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:27,223
The same people you work for...

752
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,957
the Federation... Starfleet.

753
00:38:28,997 --> 00:38:30,557
You don't expect me to believe

754
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,593
you're with Internal
Affairs, do you?

755
00:38:32,637 --> 00:38:34,003
No, of course not.

756
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:36,341
Internal Affairs is
a competent department

757
00:38:36,378 --> 00:38:37,368
but limited.

758
00:38:37,414 --> 00:38:39,111
So which department
are you with?

759
00:38:39,151 --> 00:38:40,711
Let's just say I belong

760
00:38:40,753 --> 00:38:44,693
to another branch
of Starfleet Intelligence.

761
00:38:44,728 --> 00:38:47,859
Our official designation
is Section 31.

762
00:38:47,902 --> 00:38:49,165
Never heard of it.

763
00:38:49,204 --> 00:38:50,969
We keep a low profile.

764
00:38:51,008 --> 00:38:54,503
Works out better that way
for all concerned.

765
00:38:54,548 --> 00:38:56,609
And what does Section 31 do...

766
00:38:56,652 --> 00:38:59,488
apart from kidnapping
Starfleet officers?

767
00:38:59,524 --> 00:39:00,890
We search out and identify

768
00:39:00,928 --> 00:39:02,659
potential dangers
to the Federation.

769
00:39:02,697 --> 00:39:04,223
And once identified?

770
00:39:04,267 --> 00:39:06,533
We deal with them.

771
00:39:06,572 --> 00:39:07,733
How?

772
00:39:07,807 --> 00:39:09,606
Quietly.

773
00:39:09,645 --> 00:39:11,842
So if I had been
a Dominion agent

774
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:13,944
what would have
happened to me?

775
00:39:13,987 --> 00:39:17,592
We wouldn't be standing here
having this conversation.

776
00:39:17,724 --> 00:39:20,355
Starfleet sanctions
what you're doing?

777
00:39:20,397 --> 00:39:22,594
We don't submit reports

778
00:39:22,634 --> 00:39:26,038
or ask approval
for specific operations

779
00:39:26,075 --> 00:39:27,100
if that's what you mean.

780
00:39:27,144 --> 00:39:28,544
We're an autonomous department.

781
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:30,811
Authorized by whom?

782
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:33,150
Section 31 was part

783
00:39:33,189 --> 00:39:35,182
of the original
Starfleet Charter.

784
00:39:35,226 --> 00:39:38,164
But that was 200 years ago.

785
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:39,930
Are you telling me
you've been working

786
00:39:39,969 --> 00:39:42,030
on your own ever since?

787
00:39:42,074 --> 00:39:44,203
Without specific orders?

788
00:39:44,244 --> 00:39:47,478
Accountable to nobody
but yourselves?

789
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,953
You make it sound so ominous.

790
00:39:49,989 --> 00:39:51,423
Isn't it?

791
00:39:51,459 --> 00:39:53,987
Because if what you
say to me is true

792
00:39:54,031 --> 00:39:57,596
you function as judge, jury
and executioner, and I think

793
00:39:57,637 --> 00:39:59,128
that's too much power
for anyone.

794
00:39:59,174 --> 00:40:02,112
I admit it takes
exceptional people

795
00:40:02,147 --> 00:40:03,912
to do what we do...

796
00:40:03,951 --> 00:40:06,650
people who can sublimate
their ambitions

797
00:40:06,689 --> 00:40:09,217
to the best interests
of the Federation.

798
00:40:10,363 --> 00:40:11,957
People like you.

799
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,968
Me?

800
00:40:13,002 --> 00:40:15,234
You have all the qualifications

801
00:40:15,273 --> 00:40:17,709
to be a very useful
member of Section 31.

802
00:40:17,744 --> 00:40:20,010
A few minutes ago,
you were calling me a traitor.

803
00:40:20,049 --> 00:40:21,678
And now you want to recruit me.

804
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:24,418
Well, you're intelligent,
resourceful.

805
00:40:24,458 --> 00:40:27,123
You've always been fascinated
by covert operations.

806
00:40:27,164 --> 00:40:28,827
Why else would you spend
so much time

807
00:40:28,866 --> 00:40:29,834
in Quark's holosuites

808
00:40:29,868 --> 00:40:31,997
playing spy?

809
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,099
You're serious.

810
00:40:33,142 --> 00:40:35,169
We're on the same team.

811
00:40:35,213 --> 00:40:37,240
We believe
in the same principles

812
00:40:37,284 --> 00:40:41,349
that every other Federation
citizen holds dear.

813
00:40:41,392 --> 00:40:43,225
And yet you violate
those principles

814
00:40:43,262 --> 00:40:44,423
as a matter of course.

815
00:40:44,464 --> 00:40:46,058
In order to protect them.

816
00:40:46,101 --> 00:40:47,262
Well, I'm sorry

817
00:40:47,304 --> 00:40:49,969
but the ends don't always
justify the means.

818
00:40:50,009 --> 00:40:51,034
Really?

819
00:40:56,488 --> 00:40:59,358
How many lives do you
suppose you've saved

820
00:40:59,394 --> 00:41:01,421
in your medical career?

821
00:41:01,465 --> 00:41:03,332
What has that got
to do with anything?

822
00:41:03,369 --> 00:41:05,202
Hundreds? Thousands?

823
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,110
Do you suppose those
people give a damn

824
00:41:08,145 --> 00:41:11,606
that you lied to get
into Starfleet Medical?

825
00:41:14,558 --> 00:41:15,890
I doubt it.

826
00:41:17,931 --> 00:41:20,401
We deal with threats
to the Federation

827
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:23,533
that jeopardize
its very survival.

828
00:41:23,576 --> 00:41:26,605
If you knew how many lives
we've saved

829
00:41:26,715 --> 00:41:30,450
I think you'd agree that
the ends do justify the means.

830
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:32,619
I'm not afraid
of bending the rules

831
00:41:32,661 --> 00:41:35,189
every once in a while if
the situation warrants it.

832
00:41:35,233 --> 00:41:37,635
And I don't think
you are either.

833
00:41:37,671 --> 00:41:39,003
You've got the wrong man, Sloan.

834
00:41:39,041 --> 00:41:40,009
I don't think so.

835
00:41:40,043 --> 00:41:43,413
In time, you'll come
to agree with me.

836
00:41:43,449 --> 00:41:45,646
Don't hold your breath.

837
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,658
All I ask is that when you
get back to Deep Space 9

838
00:41:48,693 --> 00:41:50,356
you consider what I've said.

839
00:41:50,396 --> 00:41:52,332
And what if I decide
to expose you?

840
00:41:53,336 --> 00:41:54,326
Let's just say

841
00:41:54,371 --> 00:41:56,102
I'm not going to lose
any sleep over it.

842
00:42:06,061 --> 00:42:08,463
I'll say one thing
for this fellow, Sloan...

843
00:42:08,499 --> 00:42:09,626
he's clever.

844
00:42:09,701 --> 00:42:12,137
He timed the doctor's abduction
to coincide with his trip

845
00:42:12,173 --> 00:42:13,505
to the medical conference.

846
00:42:13,542 --> 00:42:14,874
That way he wasn't missed.

847
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:17,610
Yes. He's clever.

848
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:19,950
We went over Julian's quarters,
but we couldn't find

849
00:42:19,988 --> 00:42:21,821
any residual
transporter signatures.

850
00:42:21,859 --> 00:42:23,556
So either they got him
off the station another way

851
00:42:23,596 --> 00:42:25,156
or they have
transporter technology

852
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:26,930
that we can't detect.

853
00:42:26,969 --> 00:42:29,600
Captain, is there any
word from Starfleet

854
00:42:29,641 --> 00:42:32,111
about Sloan or Section 31?

855
00:42:33,449 --> 00:42:36,785
There's no record
of a Deputy Director Sloan

856
00:42:36,822 --> 00:42:38,348
anywhere in Starfleet.

857
00:42:38,392 --> 00:42:39,860
And as for Section 31

858
00:42:39,895 --> 00:42:43,095
that's a little more
complicated.

859
00:42:43,135 --> 00:42:47,235
Starfleet Command doesn't
acknowledge its existence

860
00:42:47,277 --> 00:42:49,713
but they don't deny it either.

861
00:42:49,781 --> 00:42:53,185
They simply said they'd look
into it and get back to me.

862
00:42:53,222 --> 00:42:53,985
When?

863
00:42:54,023 --> 00:42:55,720
They didn't say.

864
00:42:55,827 --> 00:42:57,159
That sounds
like a cover-up to me.

865
00:42:57,197 --> 00:43:00,830
I can't believe the Federation
condones this kind of activity.

866
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,863
Personally, I find
it hard to believe

867
00:43:02,907 --> 00:43:03,966
they wouldn't.

868
00:43:04,009 --> 00:43:07,345
Every other great power
has a unit like Section 31.

869
00:43:07,383 --> 00:43:09,046
The Romulans have the Tal Shiar.

870
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,420
The Cardassians had
the Obsidian Order.

871
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:13,690
But what does that say about us?

872
00:43:13,762 --> 00:43:15,595
When push comes to shove, are we

873
00:43:15,633 --> 00:43:18,103
willing to sacrifice our
principles in order to survive?

874
00:43:18,139 --> 00:43:20,439
I wish I had an answer
for you, Doctor.

875
00:43:20,476 --> 00:43:22,673
Maybe we should
do some checking...

876
00:43:22,714 --> 00:43:24,684
try to track down
this Sloan ourselves.

877
00:43:24,718 --> 00:43:26,711
That won't be easy.

878
00:43:26,755 --> 00:43:28,725
If he's right and
Section 31 has existed

879
00:43:28,826 --> 00:43:30,523
since the birth
of the Federation

880
00:43:30,563 --> 00:43:33,033
they've learned to cover
their tracks very well.

881
00:43:33,067 --> 00:43:34,730
We don't have to find them.

882
00:43:34,804 --> 00:43:36,637
They'll come to us.

883
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:43,954
You said that Sloan
tried to recruit you.

884
00:43:43,989 --> 00:43:45,287
I turned him down.

885
00:43:45,326 --> 00:43:46,760
He doesn't strike me

886
00:43:46,795 --> 00:43:49,562
as a man who takes "no"
for an answer.

887
00:43:49,601 --> 00:43:53,473
The next time he asks you
to join his little group

888
00:43:53,509 --> 00:43:55,741
you will say "yes."

889
00:43:56,782 --> 00:44:00,813
Well, congratulations,
Doctor.

890
00:44:00,856 --> 00:44:04,158
Looks like you're going to get
to play a spy after all...

891
00:44:04,197 --> 00:44:06,360
only this time, for real.
