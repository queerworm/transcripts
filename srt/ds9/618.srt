00:00:01,502 --> 00:00:05,547
Computer, download file
to pad... F-7.

2
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:06,632
Come on.

3
00:00:06,632 --> 00:00:07,800
COMPUTER:
Download complete.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,050
Thank you! Nurse.

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,346
You're up late.

6
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:13,848
Ah, yes. I've got a few things
to finish up

7
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:15,432
before I leave in the morning.

8
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:18,853
I'm, uh, presenting a paper
at a medical conference.

9
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:20,228
I see.

10
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:21,438
Where is it?

11
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:24,316
Risa, Casperia Prime?

12
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,318
Casperia.
How'd you guess?

13
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,654
Well, doctors always hold
their conferences

14
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:29,655
at sunny resorts.

15
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:31,114
Ours is a grim profession.

16
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,825
Don't you think
we deserve a break

17
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:34,159
from all the illness and death?

18
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,536
Mm.

19
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:38,246
Well, don't forget to take
plenty of sunscreen.

20
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:39,581
Oh, let me guess.

21
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:43,502
You dislocated
your shoulder.

22
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:44,628
Not again.

23
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:46,380
Afraid so.

24
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,882
You promised me

25
00:00:47,882 --> 00:00:49,758
that you wouldn't go
kayaking again

26
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:52,011
until your shoulder
had a chance to heal.

27
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:54,304
I know, but I
can't stay away.

28
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,306
It's like the river
calls to me.

29
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,099
Yes. It's saying,
"Stay away.

30
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,227
"Don't come near me
or I'll hurt you

31
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,311
more!"

32
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,312
(<i> groans</i> )

33
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,564
Ow.

34
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:04,523
Much better.

35
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:06,025
It'll be tender

36
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:07,568
for a few days;
so go easy on it.

37
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:08,861
Right.

38
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:10,153
If the pain gets any worse

39
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,031
Nurse Bandee
will give you something.

40
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,953
Thanks, Julian.

41
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:19,621
Have a good time
on Casperia.

42
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:22,416
I'm going to a medical
conference, not on vacation.

43
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,125
Whatever you say.

44
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,670
And if the river
calls you again, listen to it

45
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,171
and stay away.

46
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:40,642
COMPUTER:
The time is 0700 hours.

47
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,770
What?

48
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,980
You're joking.

49
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,149
Computer, confirm time.

50
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:52,738
The time is 0700 hours,
11 seconds.

51
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:54,573
(<i> groans</i> )

52
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:58,869
(<i> sighs</i> )

53
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,454
Something tells me

54
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,998
I'm going to need
a lot of<i> raktajinos</i> today.

55
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:08,629
Oh.

56
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:21,558
(<i> sighs</i> )

57
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:25,312
See you in a few days, old chum.

58
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:26,855
Keep the home fires burning.

59
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:27,940
SISKO:
<i>This is the Captain.</i>

60
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,274
<i>All senior officers</i>

61
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,818
<i>report to Operations</i>
<i>immediately.</i>

62
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:32,402
What now?

63
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,154
(<i> yawns</i> )

64
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,540
(<i> yawns</i> )

65
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,128
This better be quick.

66
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:50,796
I've got a shuttle to catch.

67
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:56,760
What's going on?

68
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,803
Internal Affairs.

69
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:58,762
What are they doing here?

70
00:02:58,762 --> 00:02:59,888
They're not saying.

71
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,515
DAX:
If they'd called ahead

72
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,224
we could have thrown
them a party.

73
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:04,601
KIRA:
Yeah, well,
something tells me

74
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,811
it's not
a social visit.

75
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:06,979
WORF:
Where's the Captain?

76
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:08,522
ODO:
He's in there.

77
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,732
BASHIR:
He doesn't look too happy.

78
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,275
ODO:
No, he doesn't.

79
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,451
All right, people

80
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,412
this is Deputy Director Sloan
of Internal Affairs.

81
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:27,541
He's here under the authority
of the Federation Council.

82
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,544
I expect you all
to give him your full

83
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:31,879
cooperation.

84
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,591
Starfleet Intelligence
has reason to believe

85
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,719
that there's been
a security breach

86
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,970
aboard Deep Space 9.

87
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,346
It appears that someone

88
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,765
has been passing
information
to the Dominion.

89
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,308
With all due respect

90
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,477
I think there's been
some kind of mistake.

91
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,437
SLOAN:
I hope you're
right, Commander.

92
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:50,647
I really do

93
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,358
but until we determine
the source

94
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,236
we have to follow standard
containment procedures

95
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,446
and isolate all members
of the senior staff.

96
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,199
SISKO:
As of now

97
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:03,077
you're all relieved of duty
and confined to quarters.

98
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:04,578
Confined to
quarters?

99
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,955
I don't like it
any more than you do.

100
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,707
You'll be
contacted shortly.

101
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,542
I'll be conducting interviews
with each one of you.

102
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,169
For the time being

103
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,462
you are not to discuss this
matter amongst yourselves.

104
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:15,463
Any questions?

105
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:16,965
Uh, how long do you think

106
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,093
your investigation's
going to take?

107
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:21,511
That's difficult to say, Doctor,
but don't worry.

108
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,638
We've already informed
Starfleet Medical

109
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,766
that you won't be attending
your conference.

110
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,435
Oh, that's very considerate
of you.

111
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,229
Take them to their quarters.

112
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:40,072
Would you come
with me, please?

113
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,281
(<i> exhales slowly</i> )

114
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:58,793
Hot buttered scones,<i> mobajam,</i>
red leaf tea.

115
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,379
Please.

116
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:05,508
What's the matter
with this thing?

117
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,346
All right.

118
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,233
(<i> door chimes</i> )

119
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,943
Come in.

120
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,658
Would you please come
with me, Doctor?

121
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:33,620
Uh...

122
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,871
yes.

123
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,332
Certainly.

124
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:43,463
Where are we going?

125
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,881
To the Wardroom.

126
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,426
Director Sloan wants to
ask you a few questions.

127
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,098
MAN:
Stand clear.

128
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,438
What's going on?

129
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:01,815
Nothing you need
to worry about, sir.

130
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:02,983
This way.

131
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,159
Dr. Bashir, sir.

132
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:17,456
Thank you.

133
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:25,130
Dr. Bashir...

134
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,550
have a seat, please.

135
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,345
I'm sorry you're
going to miss

136
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:32,887
your medical conference.

137
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,431
It couldn't be helped.

138
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,016
In a case like this

139
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,976
I have to follow
strict procedures.

140
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,853
Yes, I understand.

141
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,938
Maybe it's a blessing
in disguise.

142
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,607
The last time
you tried to attend
a medical conference

143
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,734
you were taken prisoner
by the Dominion.

144
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,363
An experience
I wouldn't care to repeat.

145
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:51,448
I'm sure you wouldn't.

146
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,741
What, five weeks in a
Dominion prison camp?

147
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,328
I can't imagine what
that must have been like.

148
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,538
Not pleasant.

149
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,832
I read your report.

150
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:02,417
It made me ask myself

151
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,794
how<i> I</i> would have held up
under those conditions.

152
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,630
I guess you never really know
until you go through it.

153
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,258
I'm sure you would have
been able to cope.

154
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,135
We do what we have to
to survive.

155
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,678
Mm-hmm.

156
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:17,265
I was just reading over
some of your case reports.

157
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,642
Fascinating stuff.

158
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,979
The work you did with those
genetically enhanced patients--

159
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:23,938
very impressive.

160
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,648
Thank you.

161
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,235
Before you started working
with them

162
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,320
Starfleet Medical described them

163
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,323
as "alienated, uncommunicative
and hostile."

164
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,075
And you were the first doctor

165
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,452
who managed to establish
a dialogue with them.

166
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:38,745
Well, actually,
I think the fact

167
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,205
that I'm genetically
enhanced myself

168
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,582
made them a little more open
to accepting me.

169
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,000
You spoke their language.

170
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,544
Exactly.

171
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:50,215
I envy your profession.

172
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:53,634
You have a positive impact
on people's lives.

173
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,762
You know, I...

174
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,890
I considered becoming
a doctor myself.

175
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,517
Ah, you have a good
bedside manner.

176
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,937
Actually, when
I first came in here

177
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,814
I, uh, half suspected that,
uh, I would be interrogated

178
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,275
under a very bright light.

179
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:09,776
(<i> chuckles</i> )

180
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,528
Not this time.

181
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:14,989
Well, I see no need
to trouble you any longer.

182
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,991
Thank you for your cooperation.

183
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,452
(<i> door opens</i> )

184
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:21,496
My pleasure.

185
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,206
(<i> clears throat</i> )

186
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:26,209
Lieutenant Chandler will take
you back to your quarters now.

187
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,587
Ah, I'm afraid I'm going to have
to ask you to stay there

188
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:30,171
until I've finished
with the rest of the interviews.

189
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,672
Well, in that case, maybe you

190
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,300
could send someone
to take a look at my replicator.

191
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,384
It's not working.

192
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,719
Actually, we took them off line.

193
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:37,887
To prevent anyone

194
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,431
from trying to replicate

195
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:42,016
a communications device
or a weapon.

196
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:45,061
Oh. Well, I just wanted
some breakfast.

197
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,521
What would you like?

198
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:48,731
I'll have it sent right up
to your quarters.

199
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,150
Hot buttered scones

200
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,693
<i>moba</i> jam and some
red leaf tea, please.

201
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,322
Coming right up.

202
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:56,990
Thank you.

203
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:00,743
Doctor, one
more thing.

204
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,829
Those genetically enhanced
patients of yours--

205
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,831
did Starfleet Medical
ask you to work with them

206
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,665
or did you volunteer?

207
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,667
Oh, I volunteered.

208
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,503
I see.

209
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:10,587
Very good.

210
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:28,813
(<i> door chimes</i> )

211
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:29,856
Come in.

212
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,275
Here you are, sir.

213
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:33,234
Thank God.

214
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,069
I'm<i> famished.</i>

215
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:37,489
Cheers.

216
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:39,574
Enjoy.

217
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,580
Ugh.

218
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:48,791
It's a little early for<i> gagh.</i>

219
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:56,007
Well, I hope you're enjoying
my scones, Worf.

220
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,763
(<i> console beeping</i> )

221
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:54,982
Miles, Sloan said we aren't

222
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,443
supposed to be talking
to each other.

223
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,194
I just wanted to make sure
you were all right.

224
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,613
I'm fine, except I think

225
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,780
someone's been snooping
around my quarters.

226
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,324
It wouldn't surprise me.

227
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,909
Has Sloan questioned you yet?

228
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:05,868
Yeah, we just finished.

229
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:06,869
How'd it go?

230
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,121
It went fine.

231
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,123
He just asked me
a few routine questions.

232
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,874
Believe me, it's not fine.

233
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,960
He just grilled me
for over two hours.

234
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,128
Two hours?

235
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,045
About what?

236
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,088
About<i> you.</i>

237
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:18,256
You're joking.

238
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,174
I only wish I were.

239
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:23,094
Every single question
was about you.

240
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,679
Look, I better go

241
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,222
before they trace
this transmission.

242
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,182
I just wanted to warn you
to watch your back.

243
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,350
Miles, wait.

244
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,185
What did he want
to know about me?

245
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,979
Just be careful.
I think they're--

246
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,233
(<i> sighs</i> )

247
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,777
(<i> door chimes</i> )

248
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:39,902
Come in.

249
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:44,991
Director Sloan
wants to see you.

250
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:45,950
Again?

251
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,410
That's right.

252
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:25,323
Did you get
your breakfast, Doctor?

253
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,033
Yes, I did.

254
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,536
Good.

255
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,830
I was going over my notes
from our last conversation

256
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,039
and there are
a couple of things

257
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,165
I'd like you to clarify.

258
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:35,166
Oh?

259
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,668
You have
a problem with that?

260
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:38,419
Not at all.
Let's go back

261
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,171
to the time you spent
with the Dominion.

262
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,590
I wasn't "with" the Dominion;
I was their prisoner.

263
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,967
You were held
at internment camp 371?

264
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,010
That's right.

265
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,762
Barrack 6?
Yes.

266
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:49,347
You were there for five weeks?

267
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:50,931
37 days, actually.

268
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:53,184
You're absolutely sure
about that.

269
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,268
Yes.

270
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,228
And General Martok

271
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,896
was with you in Barrack 6.

272
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,023
Correct.

273
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,609
He said that the Jem'Hadar
removed you from the barracks.

274
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,737
I complained
when they cut our rations

275
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,446
so they threw me in solitary.

276
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,114
I see.

277
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:09,950
And did you meet with anyone
during that week?

278
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,911
I was alone.

279
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,413
You're sure about that.

280
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,873
Wait.

281
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:16,750
Um, let me think.

282
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,253
Was I alone in solitary?

283
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,462
Yes.

284
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,048
I think I was.

285
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,259
You didn't meet with a Vorta?

286
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,510
No.

287
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,344
Or a changeling?

288
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,596
No.

289
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,180
So what you're
telling me

290
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,683
is you spent seven days
in complete isolation.

291
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:34,809
It wasn't seven days.

292
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,269
It was five--<i> five</i> days.

293
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,605
Now that's odd 'cause
General Martok said

294
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,106
you were gone
for seven days.

295
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,775
He was wrong.
It was five.

296
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:44,778
Why would he lie
about something like that?

297
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:45,820
He wasn't lying.

298
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,154
You can't
both be right.

299
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:48,948
He must have lost count
of the days.

300
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,867
He was under a great deal
of stress.

301
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,034
And you weren't?

302
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,412
Human beings are more adaptable

303
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:57,081
to incarceration
than Klingons.

304
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:00,084
Especially when they're
genetically engineered?

305
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,169
Meaning what?

306
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:05,131
Let's move on
to the matter of your escape

307
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,215
from the camp.

308
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,050
I'll quote from
your own report.

309
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,095
"We constructed a transmitter
using components

310
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,473
"from the barracks
life-support system.

311
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,433
"We used it
to contact our runabout

312
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,602
and beam ourselves
out of the camp."

313
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,145
Now forgive me, Doctor.

314
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,648
That sounds
a little hard to believe.

315
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,023
It's what happened.

316
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,652
Why would the Dominion
leave your runabout

317
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,528
orbiting the camp unattended?

318
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,530
They didn't think
we'd be able to contact it.

319
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,240
Why not?

320
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,494
They left you everything
you need to build a transmitter.

321
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,370
Isn't it more plausible

322
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,706
that the Dominion
wanted you to escape?

323
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:39,749
Why?

324
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:42,001
Why would they do that?

325
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,962
So that you could start working
for them.

326
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:45,922
But I'm not working for them.

327
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,465
How can you be sure?

328
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:49,383
Excuse me?

329
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:53,012
How can you be sure
you're not working for them?

330
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,806
Are you familiar
with the term

331
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:57,350
"engramatic dissociation"?

332
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,852
Vaguely.

333
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:01,395
The theory holds
that if a person's mind

334
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,189
is sufficiently disciplined

335
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,608
he'd be capable
of compartmentalizing

336
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:08,611
contradictory information,
believing one thing

337
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,070
while doing another.

338
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:13,867
I think you possess
that kind of mind.

339
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,785
I think the Dominion saw that

340
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,286
and decided
to take advantage of it.

341
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:21,207
I think they broke you
and turned you to their cause

342
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:24,460
and then had you suppress
the memory of what happened.

343
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,839
You're saying I'm a Dominion spy
and don't even know it.

344
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,256
What could be more perfect?

345
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,300
There's no chance
of you getting caught

346
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,094
because<i> you</i> don't even realize
you're working for them.

347
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,471
When they want to debrief you

348
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,015
all they do
is trigger your memory.

349
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:38,766
That's ridiculous.

350
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:42,478
Doctor, I am trying
to help you

351
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,313
but I need your cooperation.

352
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,650
I need you to tear down
the walls inside your mind

353
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,152
to dredge up
a fragment of a memory--

354
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,072
anything about your mission,
about your contacts.

355
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,575
I know it's not easy,
but you've got to try.

356
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,119
There<i> are</i> no memories
to dredge up.

357
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,917
I'm not suffering
from engramatic dissociation.

358
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:06,961
I'm a loyal
Starfleet officer.

359
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:08,963
And will not answer
any more questions

360
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:11,049
unless I'm formally
charged and can respond

361
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:12,299
with the benefit of counsel!

362
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,176
I've had enough of
your lies, Doctor!

363
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,470
You think
you're smarter

364
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,638
than the rest
of us, don't you?

365
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,015
You think
you're smarter

366
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,558
than the millions of
brave men and women

367
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,518
who put their lives
on the line for
the Federation.

368
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,354
You want to do things
the hard way? Fine.

369
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,356
But I'm going to get
the truth out of you

370
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,150
and when I'm done, I'm going
to take whatever's left of you

371
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,736
and I'm going
to lock it away.

372
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,362
Guards!

373
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:50,088
Is it really necessary

374
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:51,839
to drag a
Starfleet officer

375
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,424
across the Promenade
in irons?

376
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,635
We have our
orders, sir.

377
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,303
Please stand aside.

378
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:58,638
We'll get you
out of this, Julian.

379
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,556
I'm sure this is
all a mistake.

380
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,266
Is it?

381
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,577
Where's Odo?

382
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,079
In his quarters.

383
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,247
We'll be handling security
for the time being.

384
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,165
This way.

385
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:42,056
Too tight?

386
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:42,974
A bit.

387
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:44,266
You'll live.

388
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:47,520
Oh, so nice to see you
enjoying your work.

389
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,107
I was with the
Seventh Fleet

390
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:53,776
when the Dominion
attacked the Tyra system.

391
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,319
98 of our ships
were destroyed

392
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,570
in a matter of hours.

393
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,156
I lost a lot of friends.

394
00:19:58,156 --> 00:19:59,281
I lost a lot
of friends, too.

395
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,282
I believe that

396
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,869
but yours were Jem'Hadar.

397
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,163
You won't be needing
this anymore.

398
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:06,455
Step inside.

399
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,386
FEMALE OFFICER:
With all due respect,
Captain

400
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,221
if you would just wait
in the Security Office

401
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,723
Director Sloan
should be here any minute

402
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,224
and you can discuss
your request with him--

403
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,559
There is nothing
to discuss.

404
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,062
I want ten minutes
alone with my officer

405
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:30,104
and I want them now.

406
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:31,605
Very well.

407
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:40,740
I thought you should know,
Odo did some checking.

408
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,325
Sloan had a son
in Starfleet.

409
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,702
He was a transport pilot.

410
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:48,622
He was killed
by a Dominion patrol.

411
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,750
Maybe he thinks I supplied
them with the information

412
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,335
that helped them target
his son's ship.

413
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,795
SLOAN:
That's exactly
what I think.

414
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:02,803
When my son's convoy
dropped out of warp

415
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,014
to rendezvous
with a Klingon bird-of-prey

416
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:07,058
they found
three Dominion attack ships

417
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:08,101
waiting for them

418
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:09,351
instead.

419
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,436
SISKO:
I'm sorry

420
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:11,979
for your loss.

421
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:15,399
But don't you think that
your son's death indicates

422
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:18,277
a conflict of interest
in your investigation?

423
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,488
No, I think it gives me
an added incentive

424
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,365
to go after the truth.

425
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:25,576
Now, what was it
you wanted?

426
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:26,827
SISKO:
I need to talk

427
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:29,580
to my Chief Medical Officer
in private.

428
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,457
I can understand that.

429
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:34,460
But security protocol

430
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,462
requires that no one
talk to the prisoner

431
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,047
without clearance from me.

432
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:41,634
Director Sloan, have you
received orders from Starfleet

433
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:44,053
to relieve me of my command
of this station?

434
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:45,679
No, I haven't.

435
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,266
Well, then, as long
as I remain in command

436
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:50,768
I will see Dr. Bashir
whenever I please.

437
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:52,019
Furthermore, from now on

438
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,480
I will sit in on all
interrogation sessions

439
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,356
to make sure
his rights are observed.

440
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,900
Do I make myself clear?

441
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,487
I believe so.

442
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:03,656
Well

443
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,866
we'll see
each other tomorrow.

444
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,410
In the meantime, enjoy
your conversation.

445
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:19,505
I appreciate your help, sir.

446
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,924
We'll get this straightened out.

447
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:23,383
I promise you.

448
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:31,558
Let's go back a few years
to the incident at Bopak III.

449
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:34,854
According to your report,
you and Chief O'Brien

450
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,522
crash-landed on the planet

451
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:39,608
where you then made contact
with a group of Jem'Hadar.

452
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,401
We didn't make contact
with them.

453
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:42,569
They captured us.

454
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,904
Well, if that's the case

455
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,906
why didn't you
attempt to escape?

456
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,241
We didn't have a chance.

457
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:49,702
According to
Chief O'Brien

458
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:52,746
you were more interested
in curing the Jem'Hadar

459
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,249
of their addiction
to ketracel-white.

460
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:56,709
I'm a doctor.

461
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,336
They were suffering
from withdrawal.

462
00:22:58,336 --> 00:23:00,004
They're the enemy--

463
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:02,673
genetically engineered
killing machines.

464
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:04,008
They're not machines.

465
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:05,592
They're sentient beings

466
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:07,636
and I couldn't just stand there
and watch them die.

467
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,639
Why? Because you felt
sympathy for them

468
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,017
being genetically
engineered yourself?

469
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:15,019
SISKO:
This is irrelevant.

470
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:17,021
We're talking about
an incident that happened

471
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:19,357
before Dr. Bashir allegedly
became a Dominion agent.

472
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:20,941
It's not irrelevant,
Captain.

473
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:23,152
If anything, it shows he
was already sympathetic

474
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:24,444
to the Dominion.

475
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:25,821
But let's move on.

476
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,657
Doctor, we spoke
yesterday about a group

477
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:31,118
of genetically
enhanced patients

478
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,953
that you brought
to the station.

479
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:35,206
Why exactly did
you decide

480
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:36,790
to work with them?

481
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,085
They'd been institutionalized
most of their lives.

482
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:40,836
I thought I might find a way

483
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,629
to help them assimilate
into society.

484
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:44,131
A laudable goal.

485
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:47,051
What I find puzzling
is the way you went about it.

486
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:48,761
These misfits had been sheltered

487
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:50,054
from the outside world

488
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:52,223
for as long as they
could remember.

489
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:53,391
Yet you chose

490
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:55,101
to bombard them with information

491
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:56,810
about the war with the Dominion.

492
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,230
Now, frankly, I'm surprised

493
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,690
it didn't scare them
into a deeper isolation.

494
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,776
I wanted to engage them.

495
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,194
And it worked.

496
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:07,696
Is that why
you convinced Starfleet Command

497
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,699
to give them access
to classified battle plans?

498
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,993
Starfleet was interested
in hearing our ideas

499
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,494
on how to win the war.

500
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:15,955
How to<i> win</i> the war.

501
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:19,417
You recommended
that the Federation surrender.

502
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:22,378
We were looking for ways to save
as many lives as possible.

503
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:25,256
Now, if you'd<i> take</i> the time
to<i> examine</i> the findings...!

504
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:26,632
Captain, you
took the time

505
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,175
to examine the
findings, didn't you?

506
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,428
(<i> sighs</i> )

507
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:31,720
I did.

508
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,347
And did you
agree with them?

509
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:35,515
No.

510
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:37,143
Of course not.

511
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:39,645
No loyal Starfleet
officer could.

512
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,563
I won't deny that
Doctor Bashir

513
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,649
has made some
questionable decisions

514
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,859
in his career, but
that's a long way

515
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,654
from convincing me
that he is a traitor.

516
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,530
Now, so far,
your case is based

517
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,950
on circumstantial
evidence and speculation.

518
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,244
What other kind of case
can I make against a man

519
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:56,703
who covers his tracks so well?

520
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:59,457
That's a circular argument,
and you know it!

521
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:02,251
Captain, if Dr. Bashir
had been involved

522
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:04,544
in one or two
questionable incidents

523
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:07,340
I could understand how you
might be able to dismiss it

524
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,216
but the sheer<i> number</i>
of incidents

525
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,677
form a pattern of behavior
that can't be ignored.

526
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:15,097
I understand that you want
to be loyal to a man

527
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:17,183
who's served under you
for so long.

528
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:19,643
I understand you'd be inclined
to take his word

529
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,519
over that of an outsider.

530
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:23,730
But step back
for a moment

531
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,399
and think about it.

532
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:26,859
This man concealed
the truth

533
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:29,069
about his illegal
genetic enhancement

534
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,612
for over 30 years.

535
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:33,782
He lied to get
his medical license.

536
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,369
He lied to get
into Starfleet.

537
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:38,371
He lied to<i> you</i> when he
came aboard this station

538
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:40,080
and he's been lying
to you ever since.

539
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:46,628
He did eventually
come forward...

540
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:47,713
and tell the truth.

541
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:50,257
That's right,
he did. Why?

542
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:52,843
Why? What made
you confess?

543
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:54,552
Was it because
you realized

544
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:56,972
that it was your duty to be
honest with your Captain?

545
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,015
No.

546
00:25:58,015 --> 00:25:59,225
Was it because you felt guilty

547
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:00,809
for having lied to him
for so long?

548
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:01,810
No.

549
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:02,978
Then why did you come forward?

550
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,688
I was found out.

551
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,482
And if you hadn't been found out

552
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:10,944
would you have come forward and
told your Captain the truth...

553
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,244
ever?

554
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:22,081
I don't know.

555
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,499
I see.

556
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,006
(<i> sighs</i> )

557
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:36,970
(<i> sighs</i> )

558
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:44,478
Sloan was right
about one thing, sir.

559
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:48,107
I should have told you the
truth from the beginning.

560
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,108
You're right.

561
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:50,901
You should have.

562
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:53,987
But let's put that
behind us for now.

563
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:56,614
How can I defend myself
to this man?

564
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:58,367
Whatever I say to him

565
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:02,037
he either thinks I'm lying
or repressing my memories.

566
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,705
I know you're not lying, Julian.

567
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:06,917
But?

568
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:10,170
But... as a doctor

569
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,006
isn't it in the realm
of medical possibility

570
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,050
that the Dominion
<i>did</i> recruit you

571
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,177
and you<i> have</i> blocked it
out of your memory?

572
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:20,722
Well, even if it is possible,
it didn't happen.

573
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:25,561
You don't believe me, do you?

574
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:27,062
I don't...

575
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,900
I don't think you're
lying, Julian.

576
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:38,865
(<i> sighs</i> ):
It's late.

577
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:39,950
Try to get some sleep.

578
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:44,246
We'll talk again in the morning.

579
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:00,471
(<i> sighs</i> )

580
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:06,059
Sorry to interrupt
your sleep, Doctor.

581
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,979
Looks like you're going on
a little vacation after all.

582
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:10,356
Where are you taking me?

583
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:13,192
SLOAN: Starbase 53
for further questioning.

584
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,901
Does Captain Sisko
know about this?

585
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:17,404
It's none of his concern.

586
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,656
Not anymore.

587
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:21,367
You have no right
to do this, Sloan.

588
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:23,410
SLOAN: Oh, but I do.

589
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:28,123
Starfleet Special Order 66715
gives me the authority

590
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:31,960
to neutralize security threats
to Deep Space Nine

591
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,421
by whatever means necessary.

592
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:38,258
Doctor, you're about to spend
the rest of this war

593
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:41,887
in a maximum-security cell...

594
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:43,347
unless...

595
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:45,516
you would care to put

596
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:48,977
your thumbprint
on this confession.

597
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:52,272
We can reword it if
it doesn't meet your

598
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:53,524
exacting standards.

599
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:55,651
You can take that confession

600
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:58,696
and throw it
out of the nearest airlock.

601
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:01,990
I thought so.

602
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,535
Take him to the shuttle.

603
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,874
Would you put your hands
in front of you, Doctor?

604
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,834
SLOAN:
He's beaming out!

605
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:13,919
Stop him!

606
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:23,345
Good evening, Doctor.

607
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:24,722
Weyoun?

608
00:29:24,722 --> 00:29:26,473
Welcome home.

609
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:36,609
It would appear we got
you out just in time.

610
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:38,026
It's all right.

611
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,737
You're among
friends now.

612
00:29:39,737 --> 00:29:40,987
Did they mistreat you?

613
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,573
I don't see any bruises.

614
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:44,783
Why did you
bring me here?

615
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,244
What choice did I have?

616
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:50,163
Starfleet discovered
you were working for us.

617
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,832
I'm not working for you.

618
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:55,168
I'm not a Dominion spy.

619
00:29:55,168 --> 00:30:00,257
You actually believe that,
don't you?

620
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:02,718
That's why you're
such a good operative.

621
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:04,261
You're lying.

622
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:05,845
(<i> sighs</i> )

623
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:07,598
Oh, here we go again.

624
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:08,932
(<i> chuckles</i> )

625
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:11,226
These little
conversations of ours

626
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:15,021
always follow
the same pattern:

627
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:17,816
You start out confused;
then you get angry;

628
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,485
then you deny everything

629
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:22,862
until finally the walls
inside your mind

630
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:26,700
start to break down
and you accept the truth.

631
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,160
What truth?

632
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,454
That you broke me
in your prison camp?

633
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:32,956
We're not barbarians.

634
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:35,751
There was no
torture involved.

635
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:38,671
We simply helped you
to see that there's

636
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:42,132
no way Starfleet
can defeat the Dominion

637
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:44,009
and because you
didn't want

638
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:47,095
billions of Federation citizens
to lose their lives needlessly

639
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,181
you agreed to provide us
with information

640
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:51,517
that would help us
end this war quickly.

641
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:55,020
You rose above
the petty question

642
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,606
of whose side you were on
and made...

643
00:30:57,606 --> 00:31:00,233
a moral decision.

644
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:04,196
It's not surprising, really.

645
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:06,740
After all, you<i> are</i> a doctor.

646
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,784
You're saying
that I'm a traitor?

647
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:12,329
Traitor, hero...

648
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:14,581
those are just words.

649
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,583
Oh, your friends
on Deep Space Nine

650
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,169
may vilify you,
but history...

651
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:23,006
will judge you
to be a great man

652
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,718
a visionary who
helped bring an end

653
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:27,344
to one of the most
devastating wars

654
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:29,137
the galaxy has
ever seen.

655
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,682
I-I don't remember.

656
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:33,141
I don't remember any of it.

657
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,643
Of course not.

658
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:36,936
You suppressed
the memories--

659
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,814
compartmentalized
them.

660
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:41,400
It's a remarkable ability,
but it does make

661
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,110
these initial conversations
a bit wearing.

662
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,532
Have something to eat.

663
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:50,367
You always
reintegrate better

664
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:52,202
on a full stomach.

665
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:57,123
Do you remember

666
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,958
when I first offered you scones?

667
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,377
Back at the camp.

668
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:01,461
No.

669
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,131
Concentrate.

670
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:10,596
Sensory details
are the key.

671
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:16,894
I had you brought in
from solitary.

672
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:19,979
You were very hungry,
but you refused to give me

673
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:23,108
the satisfaction
of seeing you eat.

674
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:27,279
Do you remember?

675
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:30,908
I don't remember...

676
00:32:30,908 --> 00:32:33,993
because it
never happened!

677
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:35,454
You were almost there.

678
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:36,996
Try again.

679
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:39,416
With a little more effort,
you can break through.

680
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:40,834
I'm not a Dominion spy!

681
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:42,001
I can see this
is going to be

682
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,712
one of our
more difficult sessions.

683
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:46,506
I'm innocent. I don't care
what you<i> or</i> Sloan think.

684
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:51,970
Wait a minute.

685
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:59,311
Why would you both be trying
to convince me of the same lie

686
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,647
unless...

687
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:04,149
you were working together?

688
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,651
Please, Doctor

689
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:07,653
listen to yourself.

690
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:09,571
Sloan's the traitor.

691
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:10,906
MALE:
<i>Combat stations.</i>

692
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:12,365
<i>Enemy ship approaching.</i>

693
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:15,828
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

694
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:21,959
Sisko.

695
00:33:24,962 --> 00:33:27,506
I'm afraid we're going
to have to continue

696
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:28,966
your debriefing later.

697
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:46,274
(<i> grunting</i> )

698
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:56,660
(<i> sighs</i> )

699
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,203
Am I glad to see you.

700
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:00,163
Away team to the<i> Defiant.</i>
We got him.

701
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:09,130
I suppose you have
a reasonable explanation

702
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,340
for why the Dominion

703
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,842
broke you out
of that holding cell.

704
00:34:11,842 --> 00:34:13,343
I understand
how this must look, sir.

705
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:14,344
What did they want?

706
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:15,637
Weyoun just tried

707
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:17,347
to convince me
that I was his operative.

708
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:19,182
I think he and Sloan
are working together.

709
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,767
Now that's enough.

710
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,435
You know you're not going
to exonerate yourself

711
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,729
by casting suspicions
on someone else.

712
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:25,063
Well, maybe he's not a traitor.

713
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,606
Maybe he's been replaced
by a changeling.

714
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,233
All I'm saying is

715
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:30,151
that both he<i> and</i> Weyoun
are trying to frame me.

716
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:32,070
You have run out
of excuses, Doctor.

717
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,364
You have to believe me.

718
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:35,615
I'm innocent.

719
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,492
I have had enough of
your lies, Doctor.

720
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,036
You can't just dismiss
what I'm saying.

721
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:40,412
Because if I'm right,
there's no telling

722
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:41,705
what kind of damage
Sloan can do--

723
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:42,915
Get him off my Bridge!

724
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:44,165
Let's go, Doctor.

725
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,668
Jadzia, you believe me,
don't you?

726
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:48,628
Why did you do it, Julian?

727
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,380
Miles? You?

728
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,968
Your shoulder--

729
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:56,553
it's all right?

730
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:57,930
Of course, it's all right.

731
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:00,265
But you dislocated it
yesterday when...

732
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:04,644
we were playing springball.

733
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:07,773
So? It's better now.

734
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:10,025
You didn't hurt it
playing springball.

735
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:13,028
You dislocated it kayaking

736
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:14,071
in a holosuite.

737
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:19,576
You're not Miles.

738
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:27,042
And you're not Captain Sisko.

739
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:30,003
He'd at least be
willing to hear me out.

740
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,967
This isn't real.

741
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:36,718
It can't be.

742
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,640
SLOAN:
You're right, Doctor.

743
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,642
None of it was real.

744
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:44,977
But I am

745
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:47,186
and this
isn't over.

746
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,195
Congratulations, Doctor.

747
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:58,991
It's not often
that we're proven wrong.

748
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:00,784
I take it you finally believe

749
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:02,535
I'm not working
for the Dominion.

750
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:05,330
I'm leaning heavily
in that direction

751
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,041
but to erase
any lingering doubts

752
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:10,460
what do you say we make
one final test?

753
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:13,130
I've finished playing games
with you, Sloan!

754
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:15,590
I can assure you, Doctor,
this is no game.

755
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:23,974
SLOAN:
Don't be afraid.

756
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:25,809
I have no intentions
of hurting you.

757
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:28,895
I just need to remove an implant
from behind your right ear.

758
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,314
I tell you what.

759
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,816
Why don't you do the honors?

760
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:34,901
Give it to him.

761
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:38,279
Go ahead, Doctor.

762
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:39,990
It's only
a neurosynaptic relay.

763
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:42,826
You've been recording my
neuro-electric responses.

764
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:44,119
That's correct.

765
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,954
And now I'd like
to check the findings

766
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:48,206
in order to confirm
what I already believe--

767
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,875
that you're an innocent man.

768
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:53,086
Now, either you remove
the relay or we will.

769
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,634
(<i> device whirring</i> )

770
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,095
(<i> clicking</i> )

771
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:11,063
Thank you.

772
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:13,648
This'll only take a moment.

773
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,901
Take your time.

774
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:18,486
I don't seem
to be going anywhere.

775
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:21,948
I'm glad to see
your sense of
humor's returning.

776
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,575
That's a very good sign.

777
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:24,993
Of what?

778
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:27,120
You're beginning to relax.

779
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,998
We subjected you
to high levels of stress

780
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:32,667
to ensure accurate test results

781
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:35,921
and I'm glad to say
the results are in your favor.

782
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:38,173
Your loyalty
to the Federation

783
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:40,550
appears to be
above reproach.

784
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:44,137
Why do I still detect a hint
of doubt in your voice?

785
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:46,598
Well, frankly,
I would have preferred

786
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:49,434
to have kept you under
observation a little longer.

787
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:52,645
Unfortunately, we didn't know
about Chief O'Brien's injury

788
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:55,607
or we would have incorporated
that into the program.

789
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,275
So you beamed me
out of my quarters

790
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,194
into this holosuite
when I was asleep.

791
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,948
I believe we allowed you
a full hour.

792
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:05,658
No wonder I feel so tired.

793
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:09,495
I suppose you find your subjects
more malleable

794
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,664
when they have been
deprived of sleep.

795
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:13,541
Not a new technique,
I admit

796
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,627
but an effective
one nonetheless.

797
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:19,839
So... why don't you tell me
who you are?

798
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,092
Who<i> you</i> work for?

799
00:38:22,092 --> 00:38:23,843
SLOAN:
I think it's obvious.

800
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:27,055
The same people you work for--
the Federation... Starfleet.

801
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:30,976
You don't expect me
to believe you're with
Internal Affairs, do you?

802
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:32,518
No, of course not.

803
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:35,688
Internal Affairs is
a competent department
but limited.

804
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,482
So which department
<i>are</i> you with?

805
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,109
Let's just say I belong

806
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:43,113
to another branch
of Starfleet Intelligence.

807
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:46,158
Our official designation
is Section 31.

808
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:47,450
Never heard of it.

809
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,410
We keep a low profile.

810
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,831
Works out better that way
for all concerned.

811
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,958
And what does Section 31 do--

812
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:57,627
apart from kidnapping
Starfleet officers?

813
00:38:57,627 --> 00:39:00,964
We search out and identify
potential dangers
to the Federation.

814
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:02,507
And once identified?

815
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,843
We deal with them.

816
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,094
How?

817
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:07,887
Quietly.

818
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:10,307
So if I had been
a Dominion agent

819
00:39:10,307 --> 00:39:12,475
what would have
happened to me?

820
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:16,313
We wouldn't be standing here
having this conversation.

821
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:18,982
Starfleet sanctions
what you're doing?

822
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:21,484
We don't submit reports

823
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:24,779
or ask approval
for specific operations

824
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:25,864
if that's what you mean.

825
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,199
We're an autonomous department.

826
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:29,534
Authorized by whom?

827
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:31,744
Section 31 was part

828
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,872
of the original
Starfleet Charter.

829
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:36,791
But that was
200 years ago.

830
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,626
Are you telling me
you've been working

831
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,795
on your own ever since?

832
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,922
Without specific orders?

833
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:46,259
Accountable to nobody
but yourselves?

834
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:48,636
You make it sound
so ominous.

835
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,222
Isn't it?

836
00:39:50,222 --> 00:39:52,598
Because if what you
say to me is true

837
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:54,851
you function
as judge, jury

838
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:56,311
and executioner, and I think

839
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:57,687
that's too much power
for anyone.

840
00:39:57,687 --> 00:40:00,815
I admit it takes
exceptional people

841
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,567
to do what we do--

842
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:05,403
people who can sublimate
their ambitions

843
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,739
to the best interests
of the Federation.

844
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:10,533
People like you.

845
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,617
Me?

846
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:13,870
You have all the
qualifications

847
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,206
to be a very useful
member of Section 31.

848
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:18,708
A few minutes ago,
you were calling me a traitor.

849
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:20,085
And now you want to recruit me.

850
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:23,046
Well, you're intelligent,
resourceful.

851
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:25,757
You've always been fascinated
by covert operations.

852
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:27,384
Why else would you spend
so much time

853
00:40:27,384 --> 00:40:28,467
in Quark's holosuites

854
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:30,636
playing spy?

855
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:31,637
You're serious.

856
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:33,765
We're on the same team.

857
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:35,850
We believe
in the same principles

858
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:39,854
that every other Federation
citizen holds dear.

859
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,731
And yet you violate
those principles

860
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:42,982
as a matter of course.

861
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,359
In order to protect them.

862
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:45,818
Well, I'm sorry

863
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:48,529
but the ends don't always
justify the means.

864
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:49,447
Really?

865
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:58,039
How many lives do you
suppose you've saved

866
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:00,125
in your medical career?

867
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:02,127
What has that got
to do with anything?

868
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:03,920
Hundreds? Thousands?

869
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,839
Do you suppose those
people give a damn

870
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,091
that you lied to get

871
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:10,176
into Starfleet
Medical?

872
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:14,555
I doubt it.

873
00:41:16,433 --> 00:41:19,102
We deal with threats
to the Federation

874
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:22,188
that jeopardize
its very survival.

875
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:25,442
If you knew how many lives
<i>we've</i> saved

876
00:41:25,442 --> 00:41:29,070
I think you'd agree that
the ends do justify the means.

877
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,323
I'm not afraid of
bending the rules

878
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:33,741
every once in a while if
the situation warrants it.

879
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,286
And I don't think
you are either.

880
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:37,578
You've got
the wrong man, Sloan.

881
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:38,913
I don't think so.

882
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:42,125
In time, you'll come
to agree with me.

883
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:44,085
Don't hold your breath.

884
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:47,297
All I ask is that when you
get back to Deep Space Nine

885
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:48,714
you consider
what I've said.

886
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:51,717
And what if I decide
to expose you?

887
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:54,595
Let's just say I'm
not going to lose
any sleep over it.

888
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:06,483
I'll say one thing
for this fellow, Sloan--

889
00:42:06,483 --> 00:42:07,900
he's clever.

890
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,277
He timed the
doctor's abduction

891
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:10,569
to coincide
with his trip

892
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:12,030
to the medical
conference.

893
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,281
That way
he wasn't missed.

894
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:15,950
Yes. He's clever.

895
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,370
We went over Julian's quarters,
but we couldn't find

896
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:19,829
any residual
transporter signatures.

897
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:22,123
So either they got him
off the station another way

898
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:24,125
or they have
transporter technology

899
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:25,502
that we can't detect.

900
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:28,087
Captain, is there any
word from Starfleet

901
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:30,548
about Sloan
or Section 31?

902
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,008
(<i> sighs</i> )

903
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:35,136
There's no record
of a Deputy Director Sloan

904
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:36,762
anywhere
in Starfleet.

905
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,139
And as for
Section 31

906
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:41,642
that's a little more
complicated.

907
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:45,646
Starfleet Command doesn't
acknowledge its existence

908
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:48,191
but they don't deny it either.

909
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:51,569
They simply said they'd look
into it and get back to me.

910
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:52,404
When?

911
00:42:52,404 --> 00:42:53,654
They didn't say.

912
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,740
That sounds
like a cover-up to me.

913
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:59,327
I can't believe the Federation
condones this kind of activity.

914
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:01,204
ODO:
Personally, I find
it hard to believe

915
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:02,455
they wouldn't.

916
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:04,123
Every other great
power has a unit

917
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,666
like Section 31.

918
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,419
The Romulans have
the Tal Shiar.

919
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:09,879
The Cardassians had
the Obsidian Order.

920
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:12,090
But what does that say about us?

921
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,966
When push comes
to shove, are we

922
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:16,469
willing to sacrifice our
principles in order to survive?

923
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:18,888
I wish I had an answer
for you, Doctor.

924
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:20,056
KIRA:
Maybe we should

925
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:21,391
do some checking--

926
00:43:21,391 --> 00:43:23,226
try to track down
this Sloan ourselves.

927
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:24,977
ODO:
That won't be easy.

928
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:27,313
If he's right and
Section 31 has existed

929
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,023
since the birth
of the Federation

930
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:31,401
they've learned to cover
their tracks very well.

931
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:33,069
SISKO:
We don't have to find them.

932
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:34,987
They'll come to us.

933
00:43:39,576 --> 00:43:42,328
You said that Sloan
tried to recruit you.

934
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,621
I turned him down.

935
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,331
He doesn't strike me

936
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:48,084
as a man who takes "no"
for an answer.

937
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:52,004
The next time he asks you
to join his little group

938
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:54,090
you will say "yes."

939
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,802
ODO:
Well, congratulations

940
00:43:57,802 --> 00:43:59,512
Doctor.

941
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:02,474
Looks like you're going to get
to play a spy after all--

942
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:04,476
only this time, for real.
