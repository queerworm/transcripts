1
00:00:18,735 --> 00:00:20,500
It's Dr. Bashir, isn't it?

2
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,203
Of course it is.

3
00:00:22,244 --> 00:00:24,613
May I introduce myself?

4
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:26,711
Uh... yes.

5
00:00:26,754 --> 00:00:27,779
Yes, of course.

6
00:00:27,824 --> 00:00:29,487
My name is Garak.

7
00:00:29,528 --> 00:00:32,194
A Cardassian by birth,
obviously.

8
00:00:32,234 --> 00:00:35,071
The only one of us left
on this station

9
00:00:35,108 --> 00:00:36,577
as a matter of fact.

10
00:00:36,611 --> 00:00:40,245
So I do appreciate making
new friends whenever I can.

11
00:00:40,353 --> 00:00:43,919
You are new to the station,
I believe.

12
00:00:43,962 --> 00:00:45,956
I am, yes.

13
00:00:48,407 --> 00:00:50,275
Though...
though I understand

14
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:52,282
you've been here quite a while.

15
00:00:52,316 --> 00:00:54,685
Ah. You know of me then.

16
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:57,286
Would you care
for some of this Tarkalean tea?

17
00:00:57,328 --> 00:00:58,490
It's very good.

18
00:00:58,531 --> 00:01:01,129
What a thoughtful young man.

19
00:01:01,171 --> 00:01:03,438
How nice that we've met.

20
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,749
You know...

21
00:01:07,786 --> 00:01:11,090
some people say
that you remained on DS9

22
00:01:11,127 --> 00:01:14,533
as the eyes and ears
of your fellow Cardassians.

23
00:01:14,569 --> 00:01:15,833
You don't say.

24
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:20,448
Doctor... you're not intimating

25
00:01:20,484 --> 00:01:22,785
that I'm some sort of spy,
are you?

26
00:01:22,822 --> 00:01:25,624
I wouldn't know, sir.

27
00:01:25,663 --> 00:01:27,964
Ah. An open mind...

28
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:30,769
the essence of intellect.

29
00:01:30,808 --> 00:01:32,539
As you may also know

30
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:34,641
I have a clothing shop nearby

31
00:01:34,684 --> 00:01:37,155
so if you should
require any apparel

32
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,819
or simply wish, as I do

33
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,890
for a bit of enjoyable
company now and then

34
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:45,171
I'm at your disposal, Doctor.

35
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:47,680
You're very kind, Mr. Garak.

36
00:01:47,716 --> 00:01:51,886
Oh, it's just Garak...
plain, simple...

37
00:01:51,925 --> 00:01:53,394
- Garak.
- Garak.

38
00:01:54,498 --> 00:01:57,062
Now, good day to you, Doctor.

39
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:03,853
I'm so glad to have made

40
00:02:03,887 --> 00:02:06,689
such an interesting
new friend today.

41
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,452
You won't believe
who just sat down

42
00:02:19,491 --> 00:02:20,858
next to me in the Replimat.

43
00:02:20,895 --> 00:02:22,057
Major, Upper Pylon 3

44
00:02:22,098 --> 00:02:24,866
will be shut down for
maintenance for 48 hours.

45
00:02:24,905 --> 00:02:27,035
The spy.

46
00:02:27,077 --> 00:02:28,546
Garak, the Cardassian.

47
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,548
We don't know for a fact

48
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:30,641
Garak's a spy, Doctor.

49
00:02:30,685 --> 00:02:32,952
He is.
You should have heard him.

50
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,584
He-He introduced himself

51
00:02:34,627 --> 00:02:37,064
and, and, and he struck up
conversation just like that.

52
00:02:37,101 --> 00:02:38,400
He was making contact with me.

53
00:02:38,437 --> 00:02:39,599
With me, of
all people.

54
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:42,339
What do you think
he might want from you, Julian?

55
00:02:44,117 --> 00:02:45,245
I don't know...

56
00:02:45,286 --> 00:02:47,416
Federation medical secrets.

57
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,588
Rest assured, they're safe
with me, Commander.

58
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,929
I'm sure they are, Dr. Bashir.

59
00:02:50,967 --> 00:02:52,436
In fact, Chief O'Brien

60
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,102
I think you should place
a monitoring device on me.

61
00:02:58,151 --> 00:03:00,281
Well, just in case...

62
00:03:00,322 --> 00:03:01,290
he...

63
00:03:01,324 --> 00:03:03,158
he's up to something?

64
00:03:03,196 --> 00:03:04,688
I don't think that will be
necessary, Doctor.

65
00:03:04,733 --> 00:03:05,792
Just be very cautious when...

66
00:03:05,836 --> 00:03:08,570
Commander, we have a small craft
taking evasive action.

67
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:10,739
Cardassian war vessel
in pursuit.

68
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:12,114
On screen.

69
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,422
That's Bajoran.

70
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,993
That damned Cardassian's
firing at a Bajoran scout ship

71
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,565
in Bajoran space.

72
00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:23,634
Mr. O'Brien?

73
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:24,647
Confirmed, sir.

74
00:03:24,681 --> 00:03:26,446
They've crossed
into Bajoran space.

75
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,458
Open a hailing frequency
to the Cardassians.

76
00:03:29,492 --> 00:03:30,825
Channel open.

77
00:03:30,863 --> 00:03:34,235
Cardassian vessel,
you are violating Bajoran space.

78
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:36,002
Break off your pursuit.

79
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,707
Repeat: Break off now.

80
00:03:38,748 --> 00:03:41,117
No reply from the Cardassians.

81
00:03:41,153 --> 00:03:43,317
Bajoran vessel is hailing us.

82
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:44,589
Open the channel.

83
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:47,158
Space station, do you read?

84
00:03:47,202 --> 00:03:48,330
Space station...

85
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:50,171
We can only get audio,
Commander.

86
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:51,473
This is Benjamin Sisko

87
00:03:51,512 --> 00:03:53,506
Starfleet Commander
of the station.

88
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,712
Who are you?

89
00:03:54,753 --> 00:03:56,690
Why are they pursuing?

90
00:03:56,724 --> 00:04:00,165
Please! Repeating request
for emergency docking. Please!

91
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:03,469
The Bajoran scout ship
is badly damaged.

92
00:04:03,574 --> 00:04:05,477
Structural integrity is failing.

93
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,743
He's breaking up.

94
00:04:07,784 --> 00:04:09,219
Get him out, Mr. O'Brien.

95
00:04:09,254 --> 00:04:10,848
Aye, sir.

96
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:19,369
Medical assistance to Ops.

97
00:04:21,216 --> 00:04:24,189
My name is Tahna Los.

98
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:27,629
Request political asylum.

99
00:04:27,665 --> 00:04:29,568
Kira?

100
00:06:29,962 --> 00:06:31,762
His name is Tahna Los.

101
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,794
We fought together
in the underground.

102
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:36,072
Commander, the Cardassians
are hailing us.

103
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:37,444
Now they want to talk.

104
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:39,452
They're hopping mad.

105
00:06:39,485 --> 00:06:41,649
Open the channel, Mr. O'Brien.

106
00:06:41,691 --> 00:06:43,388
Federation Commander

107
00:06:43,428 --> 00:06:46,299
you have taken aboard
a known criminal.

108
00:06:46,335 --> 00:06:48,533
You will turn him over to us.

109
00:06:48,573 --> 00:06:50,338
He has requested asylum.

110
00:06:50,378 --> 00:06:52,315
You have not granted it?

111
00:06:52,349 --> 00:06:53,909
To be honest,
I haven't decided yet.

112
00:06:53,953 --> 00:06:55,582
He is <i>Kohn-Ma.</i>

113
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:58,654
Not even the Bajorans
would grant his kind asylum.

114
00:06:58,697 --> 00:07:03,333
He has committed heinous crimes
against the Cardassian people

115
00:07:03,376 --> 00:07:04,606
and I demand

116
00:07:04,646 --> 00:07:06,514
that you release him
to our custody.

117
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,350
I'll investigate the matter
immediately.

118
00:07:08,388 --> 00:07:10,552
In the interim, if you care
to dock your vessel

119
00:07:10,593 --> 00:07:12,119
I'll be glad
to hear an explanation

120
00:07:12,197 --> 00:07:13,689
for having violated
Bajoran space

121
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,136
and threatened
a Federation facility.

122
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,544
We have made no threat
to your facility.

123
00:07:19,582 --> 00:07:21,553
I stand corrected.

124
00:07:21,586 --> 00:07:23,283
Sisko out.

125
00:07:25,762 --> 00:07:27,562
The Major and I
will be at the Infirmary.

126
00:07:27,601 --> 00:07:30,072
I'd like some time to talk
with this fellow Tahna.

127
00:07:30,106 --> 00:07:31,575
When Gul Danar comes in

128
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,073
it would be nice if we had
a few docking regulations

129
00:07:35,118 --> 00:07:37,089
to keep him outside a while.

130
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,957
Understood.

131
00:07:46,178 --> 00:07:48,445
You're not seriously considering

132
00:07:48,484 --> 00:07:51,218
handing Tahna over
to the Cardassians?

133
00:07:51,257 --> 00:07:53,455
Were you part of
this <i>Kohn-Ma,</i> Major?

134
00:07:53,496 --> 00:07:55,967
If I had been,
I would not be working

135
00:07:56,001 --> 00:07:58,131
with the provisional
government now.

136
00:07:58,174 --> 00:07:59,404
No, you'd still be out there

137
00:07:59,443 --> 00:08:01,414
murdering Cardassians,
or even some Bajoran

138
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:02,940
that the <i>Kohn-Ma</i>
hold in contempt.

139
00:08:02,985 --> 00:08:04,181
Didn't they claim responsibility

140
00:08:04,288 --> 00:08:05,187
for the assassination

141
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:07,284
of one of your First Ministers
last month?

142
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:11,435
Look, I know Tahna.

143
00:08:11,472 --> 00:08:13,101
Is he <i>Kohn-Ma?</i>

144
00:08:13,142 --> 00:08:14,942
Yes, but...

145
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,213
I suggest you get your
priorities straight, Major

146
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:19,620
because I don't have any
room for divided loyalties

147
00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:20,787
in this command

148
00:08:20,828 --> 00:08:22,958
and I won't have
a <i>Kohn-Ma</i> terrorist

149
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:24,970
using this station
as a protective shield

150
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,735
for continuing violence.

151
00:08:26,775 --> 00:08:28,643
My priorities are straight,
Commander.

152
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,240
Let's not be confused here.

153
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,979
My loyalties are to Bajor

154
00:08:32,021 --> 00:08:34,254
and Bajor needs men
like Tahna Los.

155
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,992
Apparently, his war with the
Cardassians isn't over yet.

156
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:38,833
If Bajor is ever to rebuild

157
00:08:38,871 --> 00:08:41,001
a strong and independent
society

158
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:43,172
it will require the repatriation

159
00:08:43,214 --> 00:08:45,515
of splinter groups
like the <i>Kohn-Ma.</i>

160
00:08:45,554 --> 00:08:48,288
You have... we have...
an opportunity here, Commander.

161
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:50,228
I hope you don't miss it.

162
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:04,471
How is he?

163
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,311
Second-degree burns, lacerations

164
00:09:06,349 --> 00:09:07,682
a minor concussion.

165
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:10,920
Not much compared to what
he's been through before.

166
00:09:11,027 --> 00:09:12,656
Before?

167
00:09:12,698 --> 00:09:14,692
The most recent of these scars

168
00:09:14,736 --> 00:09:17,300
is only two,
perhaps three years old.

169
00:09:18,312 --> 00:09:20,841
Two and a half, actually.

170
00:09:20,884 --> 00:09:23,516
It's remarkable you
lived through this.

171
00:09:23,557 --> 00:09:27,522
It's a Cardassian technique
designed to keep you alive.

172
00:09:29,404 --> 00:09:31,375
I'm Commander Benjamin Sisko.

173
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:33,380
I have a few questions
for you

174
00:09:33,414 --> 00:09:35,385
if you're up to answering them.

175
00:09:35,418 --> 00:09:37,548
Commander Sisko hasn't decided

176
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,154
whether or not to grant you
asylum yet, Tahna.

177
00:09:40,197 --> 00:09:42,134
Major, perhaps I should
conduct this alone.

178
00:09:42,169 --> 00:09:44,402
Major?

179
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,576
I'm the liaison officer
to the Federation here...

180
00:09:48,617 --> 00:09:50,781
Still fighting for Bajor

181
00:09:50,822 --> 00:09:52,485
in my own way.

182
00:09:54,631 --> 00:09:56,795
I'll stop by later.

183
00:10:05,324 --> 00:10:07,888
What do you need to know,
Commander?

184
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,060
For starters,
why were they chasing you?

185
00:10:10,135 --> 00:10:13,473
You really want to hear
the story of my life?

186
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,879
I assume, as a member
of the <i>Kohn-Ma</i>

187
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,784
you've committed serious acts
against them.

188
00:10:17,821 --> 00:10:19,085
Any one of a hundred

189
00:10:19,191 --> 00:10:22,597
that would lead
to a Cardassian death sentence.

190
00:10:22,632 --> 00:10:25,069
Any of them since
their withdrawal from Bajor?

191
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:27,969
Frankly, yes.

192
00:10:28,012 --> 00:10:29,106
Why would you

193
00:10:29,181 --> 00:10:31,243
continue the violence
against them now?

194
00:10:33,392 --> 00:10:37,698
To be honest,
I'm not sure anymore.

195
00:10:37,735 --> 00:10:41,905
We say we're punishing them
for crimes committed against us

196
00:10:41,944 --> 00:10:44,508
for over half a century

197
00:10:44,551 --> 00:10:47,752
but I've had enough
of the killing.

198
00:10:49,763 --> 00:10:51,096
I'm sorry, Commander.

199
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:52,466
He needs rest now.

200
00:10:54,675 --> 00:10:56,406
Admiral, I think Commander Sisko

201
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,418
is being incredibly
short-sighted.

202
00:10:58,452 --> 00:11:01,550
He obviously doesn't understand
the issues involved.

203
00:11:01,592 --> 00:11:03,961
Thank you for bringing this
to my attention, Major.

204
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,561
I'll stay in close touch
with the situation.

205
00:11:06,604 --> 00:11:08,073
Thank you, Admiral.

206
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,731
Sir, the Cardassian warship
has docked.

207
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:21,068
Lieutenant Dax is making sure

208
00:11:21,105 --> 00:11:23,737
that all procedural details
are precisely observed

209
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:25,750
no matter how long it takes.

210
00:11:25,784 --> 00:11:27,185
Well done.

211
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:28,586
I have some more research

212
00:11:28,624 --> 00:11:30,492
to do on the <i>Kohn-Ma</i>
before I see them.

213
00:11:30,528 --> 00:11:34,800
Sir, I don't know much
about the Bajoran terrorists

214
00:11:34,838 --> 00:11:37,436
but you've never fought
the Cardassians, have you?

215
00:11:37,478 --> 00:11:38,811
No.

216
00:11:38,848 --> 00:11:42,448
Well, you wouldn't want
to turn a man... any man...

217
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,791
over to their tender care, sir.

218
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,232
You just wouldn't.

219
00:11:47,335 --> 00:11:48,634
Subspace transmission

220
00:11:48,672 --> 00:11:51,143
from Admiral Rollman
for you, Commander.

221
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:52,840
In my office.

222
00:11:59,364 --> 00:12:00,890
Ben, that Bajoran woman

223
00:12:00,934 --> 00:12:05,309
you have working for you
interrupted a staff meeting

224
00:12:05,345 --> 00:12:07,110
to tell me how she disapproves

225
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:09,518
of your handling
of this asylum matter.

226
00:12:09,555 --> 00:12:11,890
I think you have
a problem there, Commander.

227
00:12:11,927 --> 00:12:14,125
Yes, Admiral.

228
00:12:17,173 --> 00:12:18,472
It's all right.

229
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:19,842
You're safe.

230
00:12:22,854 --> 00:12:26,522
Strange to run
into each other here, isn't it?

231
00:12:26,563 --> 00:12:28,260
It's good to be with someone

232
00:12:28,366 --> 00:12:30,667
who knows what it's been like
out there.

233
00:12:30,706 --> 00:12:34,306
Wearing that uniform,
I thought maybe you'd forgotten.

234
00:12:35,383 --> 00:12:36,282
Never.

235
00:12:36,385 --> 00:12:37,284
No?

236
00:12:37,388 --> 00:12:39,484
Working on the inside
hasn't dulled

237
00:12:39,527 --> 00:12:41,190
that old fire just a little?

238
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,292
Uh... ask Sisko about that.

239
00:12:43,402 --> 00:12:44,701
Don't get along?

240
00:12:44,739 --> 00:12:46,903
Oil and water.

241
00:12:48,582 --> 00:12:51,214
You're tired.
I should go.

242
00:12:51,254 --> 00:12:53,282
Kira?

243
00:12:53,326 --> 00:12:55,958
Do you think he'll give me
to the Cardassians?

244
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,598
Over my dead body.

245
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,306
Now, that's the Kira I remember.

246
00:13:16,014 --> 00:13:18,110
If you require all vessels

247
00:13:18,153 --> 00:13:21,092
to endure such lengthy
docking procedures, Commander

248
00:13:21,126 --> 00:13:22,094
you're going to have

249
00:13:22,128 --> 00:13:23,654
a lot of impatient traffic
out there.

250
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,668
I apologize.

251
00:13:24,702 --> 00:13:26,730
We're still trying
to repair all the damage

252
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:28,333
your forces did
before they left.

253
00:13:28,377 --> 00:13:31,248
It does create
unreasonable delays.

254
00:13:31,284 --> 00:13:35,249
I accept your apology,
but not your explanation.

255
00:13:35,294 --> 00:13:37,356
What about Tahna Los?

256
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,836
Well, we've got a problem.

257
00:13:39,871 --> 00:13:43,607
A diplomatic insult
to the Cardassian people

258
00:13:43,646 --> 00:13:45,275
would be a problem.

259
00:13:45,318 --> 00:13:48,918
Delivering a wanted criminal
to us would not be.

260
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,959
Danar, in war, both sides
commit atrocities.

261
00:13:53,003 --> 00:13:55,635
I can only tell you
that we are certain

262
00:13:55,675 --> 00:13:57,839
he plans to commit
more acts of terrorism.

263
00:13:57,881 --> 00:14:00,820
He tells me that he has
renounced the <i>Kohn-Ma</i>

264
00:14:00,855 --> 00:14:02,985
and wants to help
to rebuild Bajor.

265
00:14:03,027 --> 00:14:07,367
He has committed brutal acts
of destruction and murder

266
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:10,376
and he must pay
for those crimes.

267
00:14:10,411 --> 00:14:13,783
I appreciate
the Cardassian position

268
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:17,386
but I know if a Bajoran
freedom fighter

269
00:14:17,495 --> 00:14:20,127
is turned over
to the Cardassians

270
00:14:20,168 --> 00:14:21,637
by the Federation

271
00:14:21,672 --> 00:14:24,645
that would be a mistake
that would undermine

272
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:27,652
everything that I'm trying
to accomplish here.

273
00:14:27,686 --> 00:14:28,985
So, with apologies

274
00:14:29,022 --> 00:14:32,052
I'm going to grant him asylum
for the time being.

275
00:14:32,096 --> 00:14:35,332
Eventually, he'll want
to relocate to Bajor

276
00:14:35,371 --> 00:14:38,003
and if you want
to pursue the matter

277
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:41,610
with the provisional government,
then that's your business.

278
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:59,153
How long since you've slept
in a comfortable bed?

279
00:14:59,194 --> 00:15:03,694
I can adapt to that part
very quickly, thank you.

280
00:15:03,738 --> 00:15:05,332
I'm glad you're here.

281
00:15:05,376 --> 00:15:07,779
We need you, Tahna.

282
00:15:07,815 --> 00:15:11,415
I don't think the Federation
has any use

283
00:15:11,457 --> 00:15:13,451
for my particular talents.

284
00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:15,158
I mean, Bajor needs you.

285
00:15:16,151 --> 00:15:18,622
If you had the impression
that I'm a Federation officer

286
00:15:18,657 --> 00:15:20,126
in any way, I promise you, I...

287
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,222
I thought you were
under Sisko's command.

288
00:15:22,265 --> 00:15:23,324
I am, but...

289
00:15:23,368 --> 00:15:27,104
Now, you see, that's something
I could never adapt to.

290
00:15:27,144 --> 00:15:29,012
Someone has
to coordinate relations

291
00:15:29,082 --> 00:15:31,987
between the Federation
and the provisional government.

292
00:15:32,022 --> 00:15:33,925
At least,
with someone like me here...

293
00:15:33,961 --> 00:15:35,294
Why?

294
00:15:35,331 --> 00:15:37,393
Why should they be here at all?

295
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,706
What right does this so-called
provisional government have

296
00:15:40,743 --> 00:15:44,479
to bring them here after
all we fought for, Kira?

297
00:15:44,518 --> 00:15:45,714
Freedom from domination.

298
00:15:45,755 --> 00:15:47,224
True independence.

299
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:48,728
No outsiders.

300
00:15:48,762 --> 00:15:51,029
No Cardassians
and no Federation.

301
00:15:51,068 --> 00:15:54,634
Things have changed, Tahna.

302
00:15:54,677 --> 00:15:56,978
With the discovery
of the wormhole...

303
00:15:57,016 --> 00:15:59,648
Oh, yes, the wormhole.

304
00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:01,853
Look, I don't want
the Federation here

305
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,022
any more than you do

306
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:05,590
but they are serving a purpose,
for the time being at least.

307
00:16:05,636 --> 00:16:07,037
Without the Federation

308
00:16:07,073 --> 00:16:09,910
the Cardassians would
be back in a minute

309
00:16:09,947 --> 00:16:12,350
to take control of the wormhole

310
00:16:12,385 --> 00:16:14,515
and the wormhole is
the future of Bajor, Tahna.

311
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,322
It's bringing ships
and commerce.

312
00:16:16,362 --> 00:16:18,799
It's making us
a power in the quadrant.

313
00:16:18,834 --> 00:16:21,067
I don't want to be a power
in the quadrant.

314
00:16:21,107 --> 00:16:22,941
I want Bajor for Bajorans.

315
00:16:22,978 --> 00:16:24,607
I want our homeland back.

316
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:26,050
We have it back.

317
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:27,316
And, as we grow stronger

318
00:16:27,355 --> 00:16:29,417
we'll be able
to defend it ourselves

319
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,089
without having to lean
on the Federation

320
00:16:31,131 --> 00:16:32,760
or anyone else.

321
00:16:32,801 --> 00:16:36,105
I know it's difficult to see
after all we've been through.

322
00:16:36,143 --> 00:16:37,806
We want it all now.

323
00:16:37,847 --> 00:16:40,411
But with people like you
leading the way...

324
00:16:40,453 --> 00:16:43,791
You have adapted, haven't you?

325
00:16:43,827 --> 00:16:48,395
Tahna, I have put myself
on the line for you here.

326
00:16:48,439 --> 00:16:51,139
You are finished
with the <i>Kohn-Ma?</i>

327
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:53,811
Yes.

328
00:16:53,851 --> 00:16:56,186
Yes, I am finished
with the <i>Kohn-Ma.</i>

329
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:01,403
I've been talking
with several of the ministers

330
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:04,103
of the provisional government
about amnesty

331
00:17:04,177 --> 00:17:07,549
for you and any member
of the <i>Kohn-Ma</i> who follows you.

332
00:17:07,585 --> 00:17:10,022
Well, there are some
who might...

333
00:17:10,057 --> 00:17:11,492
if there were assurances.

334
00:17:11,527 --> 00:17:13,794
I'm working on it, Tahna.

335
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,829
I'll find a way
to make it happen.

336
00:17:28,869 --> 00:17:30,338
What?

337
00:17:30,372 --> 00:17:32,103
Sir, we've had a little problem.

338
00:17:32,144 --> 00:17:36,610
These two women
are just arriving.

339
00:17:36,654 --> 00:17:38,921
They objected to giving up
their weapons.

340
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:42,091
Klingons do not
surrender their weapons.

341
00:17:42,134 --> 00:17:43,501
Who are you?

342
00:17:43,538 --> 00:17:46,808
We are Lursa and B'Etor
of the house of Duras.

343
00:17:46,845 --> 00:17:48,508
And we have
specific regulations.

344
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:51,614
You can leave the weapons
or leave the station.

345
00:17:51,657 --> 00:17:53,354
Your choice.

346
00:17:53,395 --> 00:17:54,557
Please make it now.

347
00:17:54,597 --> 00:17:55,930
Who are you?

348
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:59,669
I'm the one
giving you the choice.

349
00:18:10,101 --> 00:18:12,163
Welcome to DS9.

350
00:18:17,953 --> 00:18:21,519
We have some new guests
you might be interested in.

351
00:18:21,562 --> 00:18:23,054
A couple of Klingon sisters

352
00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:25,036
from the Duras family.

353
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,234
Lursa and B'Etor.

354
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:28,710
You know them then?

355
00:18:28,746 --> 00:18:32,187
They tried to grab control
of the Klingon High Council.

356
00:18:32,221 --> 00:18:33,884
Started a brief civil war.

357
00:18:33,924 --> 00:18:36,191
They've been out
of sight since then.

358
00:18:36,231 --> 00:18:37,928
I ran a security check.

359
00:18:37,968 --> 00:18:40,873
The Klingons have them
listed as renegades.

360
00:18:40,908 --> 00:18:43,277
We've heard they've been
trying to raise capital

361
00:18:43,314 --> 00:18:44,943
to rebuild their armies.

362
00:18:44,985 --> 00:18:46,956
What are they doing here?

363
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,516
Sitting.

364
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,966
They went straight to Quark's,
but not for the gambling

365
00:18:52,002 --> 00:18:54,496
and certainly not for the food.

366
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:55,976
They're just sitting.

367
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:57,845
I don't like it.

368
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:01,581
Why don't I... lock them up

369
00:19:01,624 --> 00:19:05,224
and call the Klingons
to come get them?

370
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:06,530
Odo.

371
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:09,168
If they're enemies
of the Klingon High Council...

372
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,704
They haven't broken
any laws here.

373
00:19:11,749 --> 00:19:15,520
You can't just
throw them in jail.

374
00:19:15,558 --> 00:19:17,961
You know, Cardassian rule
may have been oppressive

375
00:19:17,997 --> 00:19:20,264
but at least it was simple.

376
00:19:20,302 --> 00:19:22,500
Keep an eye on them.

377
00:19:24,011 --> 00:19:25,948
As you wish, Commander.

378
00:19:54,953 --> 00:19:57,983
And how are you this evening,
Mr. Garak?

379
00:19:58,026 --> 00:19:59,518
Excuse me.

380
00:19:59,563 --> 00:20:02,057
Just plain, simple Garak,
you said.

381
00:20:02,103 --> 00:20:03,903
Plain and simple.

382
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,603
Join me, Doctor.

383
00:20:05,645 --> 00:20:07,239
Enhance my evening.

384
00:20:07,282 --> 00:20:11,588
Keeping an eye on the ebb
and flow of things, are you?

385
00:20:11,626 --> 00:20:14,599
As a clothier,
I do have a keen interest

386
00:20:14,633 --> 00:20:17,663
on what the population
is wearing from day to day.

387
00:20:17,706 --> 00:20:20,611
Klingons have
an odd sense of style.

388
00:20:20,648 --> 00:20:22,448
Don't you agree?

389
00:20:22,485 --> 00:20:24,285
Oh, yes, they do.

390
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,622
But intriguing.

391
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,856
I would say

392
00:20:26,895 --> 00:20:31,896
that those two outfits
are worth studying closely.

393
00:20:38,857 --> 00:20:40,851
Look.

394
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:14,270
All right, where's the payment?

395
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:15,778
It's on its way.

396
00:21:15,813 --> 00:21:17,510
That was not the arrangement.

397
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,747
I couldn't stop to get it.

398
00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:21,851
I barely got past
the Cardassians.

399
00:21:21,894 --> 00:21:23,488
Your safety is not our concern.

400
00:21:23,531 --> 00:21:25,262
Your gold is.

401
00:21:25,302 --> 00:21:27,170
It will be available tomorrow.

402
00:21:27,207 --> 00:21:28,836
Good.

403
00:21:28,877 --> 00:21:32,044
Because if we have made
this trip for nothing

404
00:21:32,085 --> 00:21:35,081
you will have made
a fatal mistake.

405
00:22:01,338 --> 00:22:04,140
I managed to arrange a hearing
of the Ministers' Court.

406
00:22:04,178 --> 00:22:05,168
Any predictions?

407
00:22:05,215 --> 00:22:06,741
Well, I have
two of the ministers...

408
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:08,653
the smart ones...
ready to vote for amnesty.

409
00:22:08,756 --> 00:22:10,659
I'm sure one of the others
will fall in line.

410
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,059
Good.

411
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:14,227
And Tahna says
two more of the <i>Kohn-Ma</i>

412
00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:15,670
are willing to follow him

413
00:22:15,772 --> 00:22:17,902
if you'll guarantee
their safety.

414
00:22:17,945 --> 00:22:19,574
Done.

415
00:22:19,616 --> 00:22:21,678
I have to say this, Commander.

416
00:22:21,787 --> 00:22:25,250
When we first talked,
I wasn't sure you...

417
00:22:25,296 --> 00:22:29,932
This wouldn't have been possible
without your support.

418
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:32,605
I want you to know
it's appreciated.

419
00:22:32,647 --> 00:22:33,706
Be sure to mention it

420
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,085
the next time you chat
with Admiral Rollman.

421
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:38,821
Sir?

422
00:22:38,862 --> 00:22:40,730
Go over my head again

423
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:43,362
and I'll have yours
on a platter.

424
00:22:50,991 --> 00:22:56,197
So, Constable, news
about our Klingon sisters?

425
00:22:56,236 --> 00:22:58,605
They seem to make friends
easily.

426
00:22:58,642 --> 00:22:59,941
Friends?

427
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:02,381
Our reformed <i>Kohn-Ma,</i>
for example.

428
00:23:02,418 --> 00:23:05,050
Tahna, with Lursa and B'Etor?

429
00:23:05,091 --> 00:23:06,720
Talking about
a business arrangement.

430
00:23:06,795 --> 00:23:08,230
He's paying them for something.

431
00:23:08,265 --> 00:23:09,564
I don't know what.

432
00:23:09,602 --> 00:23:11,573
The gold is
supposedly on its way.

433
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:14,580
Two other members of the <i>Kohn-Ma</i>
may be bringing it.

434
00:23:14,614 --> 00:23:16,608
How do you know that?

435
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:24,366
Major Kira mentioned
that they were on their way.

436
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:27,434
Do you want her
to know about this?

437
00:23:27,478 --> 00:23:29,540
Not quite yet.

438
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:46,215
You are the clothier Garak?

439
00:23:46,256 --> 00:23:48,557
At your service, madam.

440
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:52,731
May I show you some
of our latest fashions?

441
00:23:52,772 --> 00:23:57,010
Perhaps some silk lingerie
from Kraus IV?

442
00:23:57,049 --> 00:23:59,851
Watch your tongue,
Cardassian, or I'll

443
00:23:59,889 --> 00:24:01,188
rip it out and eat it!

444
00:24:03,564 --> 00:24:06,196
I meant no offense.

445
00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:09,701
I have few Klingon patrons.

446
00:24:09,746 --> 00:24:13,653
So, is there something
you wish to buy?

447
00:24:13,688 --> 00:24:16,388
We're not here to buy.

448
00:24:16,428 --> 00:24:19,026
We are here to sell.

449
00:24:19,068 --> 00:24:20,469
We understand

450
00:24:20,505 --> 00:24:23,968
you still represent
Cardassian interests here.

451
00:24:24,014 --> 00:24:27,853
Ah, I am only a simple
clothing merchant.

452
00:24:27,923 --> 00:24:30,589
We have no time for your games!

453
00:24:30,629 --> 00:24:32,429
Do you want Tahna Los or not?!

454
00:24:32,467 --> 00:24:35,133
Are you in a position
to deliver the Bajoran

455
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:36,608
to Cardassian authorities?

456
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:38,010
What is he worth to them?

457
00:24:38,047 --> 00:24:40,815
In gold-pressed latinum?

458
00:24:51,446 --> 00:24:52,779
You insult us!

459
00:24:52,816 --> 00:24:55,653
Ladies, ladies, please.

460
00:24:55,689 --> 00:24:57,420
Everything is negotiable.

461
00:24:57,461 --> 00:25:00,025
I am no more
than what I seem to be...

462
00:25:00,066 --> 00:25:03,062
a merchant trying to make
the best transaction.

463
00:25:03,107 --> 00:25:07,813
So... let us haggle.

464
00:25:13,131 --> 00:25:14,121
Yes?

465
00:25:18,344 --> 00:25:20,838
I have
the third minister's vote.

466
00:25:20,883 --> 00:25:22,786
The hearing is simply
a formality now.

467
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:25,453
You are going
to receive amnesty, Tahna.

468
00:25:25,494 --> 00:25:28,365
I never realized you were such
an accomplished politician.

469
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:31,340
Me? A politician?

470
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:33,346
No, I don't think so.

471
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,944
You manipulate Sisko
and the Federation

472
00:25:36,052 --> 00:25:38,114
the ministers
of the provisional government...

473
00:25:38,157 --> 00:25:39,683
I'm just determined.

474
00:25:39,729 --> 00:25:43,397
I think they all simply
get tired of hearing my voice.

475
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:48,715
And here we expected to find

476
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:52,692
that Kira Nerys had lost
the fire in her heart.

477
00:25:52,726 --> 00:25:54,663
What are you talking about?

478
00:25:58,038 --> 00:26:00,339
You knew I was here
before you even came.

479
00:26:03,385 --> 00:26:05,322
Tahna, I trusted you.

480
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:07,190
I am <i>Kohn-Ma.</i>

481
00:26:07,227 --> 00:26:09,198
I fight for the freedom
of Bajor.

482
00:26:09,232 --> 00:26:11,203
You once fought for it, as well.

483
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:12,604
I'm still fighting for it.

484
00:26:12,641 --> 00:26:14,235
Stop deluding yourself!

485
00:26:14,278 --> 00:26:17,445
You say you don't believe
in the Federation.

486
00:26:17,485 --> 00:26:19,422
You say you don't believe
in the provisional government

487
00:26:19,456 --> 00:26:20,823
and yet you are
their dance instructor.

488
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,329
That's not fair.

489
00:26:22,363 --> 00:26:23,992
Don't be naive, Major!

490
00:26:24,035 --> 00:26:26,529
I don't want the Federation
here, but, for now...

491
00:26:26,574 --> 00:26:29,411
Once you're in your comfortable
bed with the Federation

492
00:26:29,447 --> 00:26:30,541
you won't be able to get out.

493
00:26:30,584 --> 00:26:31,678
We won't be able to get out.

494
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:33,245
If you expect me to commit

495
00:26:33,289 --> 00:26:35,783
some act of violence
against the Federation...

496
00:26:35,829 --> 00:26:38,027
No... no, the violence is over.

497
00:26:38,134 --> 00:26:39,433
That is the truth.

498
00:26:39,471 --> 00:26:41,772
No one will get hurt in any way.

499
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,040
I promise you that.

500
00:26:43,146 --> 00:26:44,946
But I do need your help.

501
00:26:44,985 --> 00:26:46,956
You already lied to me, Tahna.

502
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,619
I know how the game works.

503
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,685
To do what we plan

504
00:26:49,729 --> 00:26:52,200
we need a small ship
capable of warp speed.

505
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:56,234
I gambled that I could convince
you to get it for us.

506
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:58,648
And just what is
this peaceful plan?

507
00:26:58,684 --> 00:27:00,917
In one move, and nonviolently

508
00:27:00,956 --> 00:27:04,921
we accomplish everything
both of us has ever wanted

509
00:27:04,966 --> 00:27:05,934
for Bajor.

510
00:27:05,968 --> 00:27:06,958
How?

511
00:27:08,808 --> 00:27:11,041
I know the game, too, Kira.

512
00:27:11,113 --> 00:27:14,143
You know I cannot risk
telling you that.

513
00:27:14,188 --> 00:27:18,153
How do you know I won't
just go straight to Sisko?

514
00:27:20,502 --> 00:27:22,062
Well, if you do,
then we'll both know

515
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,234
where your loyalties are

516
00:27:23,276 --> 00:27:25,338
won't we?

517
00:27:32,382 --> 00:27:34,683
Ah, plain, simple Garak.

518
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,189
How are you today?

519
00:27:36,224 --> 00:27:39,220
Being observant, Doctor.

520
00:27:39,265 --> 00:27:40,666
I'm sure of it.

521
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:43,402
There's a time for levity,
my young friend

522
00:27:43,442 --> 00:27:46,574
and a time for genuine concern.

523
00:27:46,616 --> 00:27:49,612
The arrival on this station,
for instance

524
00:27:49,656 --> 00:27:51,889
of those two <i>Kohn-Ma</i> terrorists.

525
00:27:51,928 --> 00:27:54,422
Terrorists?

526
00:27:54,468 --> 00:27:56,439
What are they doing here?

527
00:27:56,473 --> 00:28:00,107
I'm not exactly sure,
but, together

528
00:28:00,148 --> 00:28:03,816
we might have some success
at finding out.

529
00:28:03,857 --> 00:28:05,622
Garak, I'm a doctor, not...

530
00:28:05,662 --> 00:28:08,464
And, once you do have
the appropriate answer

531
00:28:08,502 --> 00:28:12,307
I'm sure you'll know
what to do with it.

532
00:28:12,344 --> 00:28:14,144
I really must
be getting along now.

533
00:28:14,182 --> 00:28:15,811
Uh... Doctor...

534
00:28:15,853 --> 00:28:20,159
I think it's time for you
to take advantage of my shop.

535
00:28:20,196 --> 00:28:23,830
If you'll be there
at exactly 2055 hours tonight

536
00:28:23,872 --> 00:28:26,173
I promise to show you a suit

537
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:28,842
that will make you
into a new man.

538
00:28:28,884 --> 00:28:30,012
A suit?

539
00:28:30,053 --> 00:28:31,522
We're talking about terrorists

540
00:28:31,557 --> 00:28:34,530
and you want me
to buy a new suit.

541
00:28:34,564 --> 00:28:36,535
Doctor, am I making
myself clear?

542
00:28:36,569 --> 00:28:41,035
I want you to buy
a new suit tonight at 2055...

543
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:42,548
exactly.

544
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:43,882
Uh, yes.

545
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,219
I see.

546
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:47,557
Well, if you'll excuse me.

547
00:28:47,595 --> 00:28:49,395
Mmm.

548
00:28:54,378 --> 00:28:55,677
A suit.

549
00:28:55,715 --> 00:28:57,048
Mmm.

550
00:29:04,903 --> 00:29:06,372
Major.

551
00:29:06,407 --> 00:29:07,933
Commander.

552
00:29:12,488 --> 00:29:15,518
I'd like to meet the two <i>Kohn-Ma</i>
who just arrived

553
00:29:15,562 --> 00:29:16,792
as soon as possible.

554
00:29:16,899 --> 00:29:18,232
Of course.

555
00:29:18,269 --> 00:29:19,568
I'll arrange it.

556
00:29:19,605 --> 00:29:21,906
How do they seem to you?

557
00:29:21,944 --> 00:29:23,072
Sir?

558
00:29:23,114 --> 00:29:25,415
Do you feel as secure about them

559
00:29:25,452 --> 00:29:27,923
as you do about Tahna Los?

560
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:29,485
Absolutely.

561
00:29:29,529 --> 00:29:30,964
Commander Sisko.

562
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:37,281
I need some guidance.

563
00:29:37,315 --> 00:29:38,614
Yes, Doctor.

564
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:40,986
It's about Garak...
the Cardassian.

565
00:29:41,023 --> 00:29:45,125
I'm afraid this relationship
has gotten a little out of hand.

566
00:29:45,167 --> 00:29:46,135
How's that?

567
00:29:46,169 --> 00:29:48,299
He wants me to buy a suit.

568
00:29:48,341 --> 00:29:49,309
A suit?

569
00:29:49,344 --> 00:29:50,813
At exactly 2055 tonight.

570
00:29:50,847 --> 00:29:51,815
Why 2055?

571
00:29:51,849 --> 00:29:53,250
I don't know,
but it has something to do

572
00:29:53,286 --> 00:29:55,655
with those two Bajoran
terrorists on board.

573
00:29:55,691 --> 00:29:58,664
He says that, together,
he and I might discover

574
00:29:58,699 --> 00:29:59,998
what they're really doing here.

575
00:30:00,036 --> 00:30:02,098
I don't understand
why he wants me involved.

576
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,338
Sometimes communications
can't be conducted

577
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,679
through official channels.

578
00:30:05,715 --> 00:30:08,347
Maybe this is their way
of telling us

579
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:09,858
that we have a common enemy.

580
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:11,259
Well, what do you want me to do?

581
00:30:11,295 --> 00:30:14,929
I think, Doctor, you could
definitely use a new suit.

582
00:30:22,423 --> 00:30:24,394
Busy?

583
00:30:24,428 --> 00:30:27,732
What can I do for you?

584
00:30:27,768 --> 00:30:31,402
Are, um... are all
the security measures in place

585
00:30:31,444 --> 00:30:34,110
for the trip
to the Ministers' Court?

586
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:37,089
I told you they'd be
taken care of and they will.

587
00:30:42,737 --> 00:30:45,733
Fine.

588
00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:53,018
You know, there's one thing
about you humanoids

589
00:30:53,096 --> 00:30:55,728
I can't imitate very well.

590
00:30:55,768 --> 00:30:57,260
What's that?

591
00:30:57,306 --> 00:30:59,573
Pretense.

592
00:30:59,612 --> 00:31:02,608
There's a special talent to it.

593
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,919
It's as hard for me

594
00:31:04,957 --> 00:31:07,428
as creating one of your noses.

595
00:31:07,464 --> 00:31:11,668
Maybe that's why I've learned
to respect your opinion

596
00:31:11,707 --> 00:31:14,908
Constable... never any pretense.

597
00:31:25,908 --> 00:31:28,038
How much do you know about me,
Odo?

598
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:33,017
More than you probably realize.

599
00:31:34,862 --> 00:31:38,861
I've done some things
I'm not proud of.

600
00:31:40,543 --> 00:31:45,852
I still have nightmares about
the raids on the Haru Outpost

601
00:31:45,889 --> 00:31:50,595
but at least I was sure
about what I was doing then.

602
00:31:55,512 --> 00:31:57,004
And...

603
00:31:58,854 --> 00:32:02,295
there's something
you're not sure of now.

604
00:32:02,328 --> 00:32:05,301
You have no more love
for the Federation than I do.

605
00:32:05,336 --> 00:32:06,464
Meaning?

606
00:32:08,209 --> 00:32:10,807
Maybe there are still wars
to be fought

607
00:32:10,848 --> 00:32:13,251
and I'm just
making a fool of myself

608
00:32:13,288 --> 00:32:15,122
doing what I'm doing here.

609
00:32:17,565 --> 00:32:22,532
It sounds like you're trying to
talk yourself into something...

610
00:32:22,577 --> 00:32:24,548
or out of something.

611
00:32:24,582 --> 00:32:28,114
Either way,
I have to betray someone.

612
00:32:28,191 --> 00:32:32,793
The only important thing
is not to betray yourself.

613
00:32:35,274 --> 00:32:40,014
How could I possibly turn
against my own people?

614
00:32:40,052 --> 00:32:41,886
Are they

615
00:32:41,923 --> 00:32:43,256
your own people?

616
00:32:43,293 --> 00:32:46,095
They're no different
than I used to be.

617
00:32:47,804 --> 00:32:49,775
Used to be?

618
00:32:49,809 --> 00:32:52,873
I could just refuse
to help them...

619
00:32:52,916 --> 00:32:54,944
ignore the whole thing.

620
00:32:58,263 --> 00:33:04,575
The Joranian ostrich hides by
sticking its head underwater...

621
00:33:04,611 --> 00:33:08,017
sometimes even until it drowns.

622
00:33:09,857 --> 00:33:11,292
And they'd find a way

623
00:33:11,327 --> 00:33:13,856
to do whatever
they want to do anyway

624
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:17,466
and I'd still feel responsible
for the consequences.

625
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:29,330
It was so much easier
when I knew who the enemy was.

626
00:33:30,673 --> 00:33:32,302
Odo to Sisko.

627
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,315
Go ahead.

628
00:33:34,349 --> 00:33:36,183
There's someone down in here
in security

629
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,917
who wants to talk to you,
Commander.

630
00:33:43,538 --> 00:33:45,007
Come in quickly, Doctor.

631
00:33:45,041 --> 00:33:46,340
You're late.

632
00:33:46,378 --> 00:33:47,677
It's 2057.

633
00:33:47,714 --> 00:33:49,013
Now just take this

634
00:33:49,051 --> 00:33:52,423
and try it on
as many times as you like.

635
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:53,791
And stay very, very quiet.

636
00:33:53,828 --> 00:33:54,990
I was just...

637
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:08,660
Ah, right on time.

638
00:34:08,698 --> 00:34:10,167
Welcome.

639
00:34:10,201 --> 00:34:12,672
Save your welcome, Cardassian.

640
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:15,681
Do your people
want the Bajoran or not?

641
00:34:15,715 --> 00:34:19,349
I can now venture to say,
with some certainty

642
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,363
that you will receive
the agreed-upon payment

643
00:34:22,397 --> 00:34:23,696
on delivery.

644
00:34:23,734 --> 00:34:26,707
We will complete
our business with Tahna Los

645
00:34:26,741 --> 00:34:28,040
in four hours.

646
00:34:28,077 --> 00:34:30,207
And what business might that be?

647
00:34:30,249 --> 00:34:32,243
That is not your concern.

648
00:34:32,287 --> 00:34:35,226
If it requires
that those I represent

649
00:34:35,261 --> 00:34:38,565
must take extra precautions,
it becomes my concern.

650
00:34:38,603 --> 00:34:43,570
We will deliver him
a cylinder of bilitrium.

651
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:45,586
The rendezvous will be

652
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:49,254
on the dark side
of Bajor VIII's lower moon.

653
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:52,895
The Cardassians
can have him then.

654
00:35:04,933 --> 00:35:06,733
What's bilitrium?

655
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:08,570
Ah, a rare, crystalline element

656
00:35:08,608 --> 00:35:12,071
that can be an incredibly
powerful source of energy

657
00:35:12,117 --> 00:35:15,090
provided, of course, one has
an antimatter converter.

658
00:35:15,124 --> 00:35:17,425
Unfortunately,
that's why Cardassians

659
00:35:17,462 --> 00:35:20,128
were chasing Tahna Los
when he arrived here.

660
00:35:20,169 --> 00:35:22,436
He stole one.

661
00:35:22,474 --> 00:35:24,775
But if he's got both...

662
00:35:24,814 --> 00:35:26,283
Quite right, Doctor.

663
00:35:26,317 --> 00:35:28,550
He has the ingredients
for a bomb...

664
00:35:28,589 --> 00:35:34,160
a bomb of significant
destructive capability.

665
00:35:43,861 --> 00:35:45,832
We have nothing to hold them on.

666
00:35:45,866 --> 00:35:47,837
They haven't
committed any crime yet.

667
00:35:47,871 --> 00:35:49,397
Conspiracy is a crime.

668
00:35:49,441 --> 00:35:50,671
Conspiracy to what?

669
00:35:50,777 --> 00:35:52,577
We don't even know
what their plan is.

670
00:35:52,615 --> 00:35:54,586
Once the switch
with the Klingons is made

671
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,089
you've got them holding
the components

672
00:35:56,123 --> 00:35:57,148
to an explosive device.

673
00:35:57,193 --> 00:35:58,685
That's evidence
enough right there.

674
00:35:58,796 --> 00:36:00,231
Chief O'Brien is right.

675
00:36:00,267 --> 00:36:02,238
We have to give them
the runabout.

676
00:36:02,272 --> 00:36:03,240
Agreed.

677
00:36:03,274 --> 00:36:05,643
And I have to be on it.

678
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,548
Not agreed, Major.

679
00:36:07,584 --> 00:36:10,182
Commander, Tahna doesn't know
if he can trust me as it is.

680
00:36:10,224 --> 00:36:12,422
If I try to stay behind,
he won't buy into this.

681
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:14,660
The only way to convince him
is if I'm on board.

682
00:36:14,701 --> 00:36:16,034
If Tahna fails

683
00:36:16,071 --> 00:36:18,338
I promise you, others will try.

684
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:20,847
At least this way,
you can find out

685
00:36:20,883 --> 00:36:22,284
what they're up to.

686
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,689
Mr. O'Brien,
you and I will take a runabout

687
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:26,490
to a point behind
the second moon of Bajor VIII

688
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:27,692
to avoid detection.

689
00:36:27,733 --> 00:36:28,701
Aye, sir.

690
00:36:28,768 --> 00:36:31,707
Dax, stay in touch with us
on a secured channel.

691
00:36:31,775 --> 00:36:34,144
Keep an eye on the Cardassians.

692
00:36:34,182 --> 00:36:36,312
They'll be coming
to the party, too.

693
00:36:38,224 --> 00:36:40,525
You get him there, Major.

694
00:36:40,563 --> 00:36:42,830
We'll be waiting.

695
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:54,661
They're moving
into the runabout.

696
00:36:54,697 --> 00:36:55,687
Acknowledged.

697
00:36:55,733 --> 00:36:56,861
DS9 to <i>Ganges.</i>

698
00:36:56,902 --> 00:36:58,098
Go ahead.

699
00:36:58,139 --> 00:36:59,506
They're in the <i>Yangtzee Kiang.</i>

700
00:36:59,542 --> 00:37:01,513
They're initializing
prelaunch systems now.

701
00:37:01,547 --> 00:37:03,107
Understood, Lieutenant.

702
00:37:03,151 --> 00:37:05,486
Shut down
all main power systems.

703
00:37:11,671 --> 00:37:14,735
Dead quiet.

704
00:37:20,793 --> 00:37:24,256
Bajor VIII
in 120,000 kilometers.

705
00:37:24,302 --> 00:37:26,466
Dropping to impulse.

706
00:37:31,118 --> 00:37:32,587
What is that?

707
00:37:34,259 --> 00:37:36,423
An antimatter converter.

708
00:37:36,464 --> 00:37:38,492
I'm transferring power
from the ship's warp drive

709
00:37:38,536 --> 00:37:39,526
into the storage cells.

710
00:37:40,674 --> 00:37:43,545
We've got a Klingon bird-of-prey
de-cloaking dead ahead.

711
00:37:43,581 --> 00:37:44,914
It's all right.

712
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:47,684
We're here to meet them.

713
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:50,561
Klingons? Why?

714
00:37:50,597 --> 00:37:52,659
You'll know soon enough.

715
00:38:00,722 --> 00:38:03,193
The Klingons have powered up
their transporters.

716
00:38:03,228 --> 00:38:05,222
Prepare to go to full impulse.

717
00:38:14,388 --> 00:38:15,789
13 kilograms

718
00:38:15,825 --> 00:38:17,955
of gold-pressed latinum,
as promised.

719
00:38:17,997 --> 00:38:19,489
This is yours.

720
00:38:22,274 --> 00:38:24,268
<i>'EH. HlmaH!</i>

721
00:38:27,553 --> 00:38:28,852
What is it?

722
00:38:28,956 --> 00:38:31,622
Bajoran independence.

723
00:38:35,272 --> 00:38:37,436
Bird-of-prey is moving off
and cloaking.

724
00:38:38,545 --> 00:38:40,982
Set up an intercept course
for the runabout.

725
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:43,719
Intercept in one minute,
12 seconds.

726
00:38:47,768 --> 00:38:49,294
DS9 to <i>Ganges.</i>

727
00:38:49,339 --> 00:38:50,740
<i>Ganges.</i>

728
00:38:50,776 --> 00:38:52,644
The Cardassian Warship <i>Aldara</i>

729
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,480
is crossing the border,
Benjamin

730
00:38:54,518 --> 00:38:57,150
on an intercept course
with the <i>Yangtzee Kiang.</i>

731
00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:00,391
They'll enter Bajoran space
in 29 seconds.

732
00:39:00,432 --> 00:39:02,163
Acknowledged.

733
00:39:02,202 --> 00:39:05,004
The <i>Yangtzee's</i> sensors should
be picking us up now, sir.

734
00:39:08,885 --> 00:39:10,320
What is that?

735
00:39:10,356 --> 00:39:12,019
It's another runabout.

736
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:14,827
They must have been
waiting for us here.

737
00:39:14,866 --> 00:39:16,335
How did they know?

738
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:18,773
We also have a Cardassian
warship three minutes away.

739
00:39:18,809 --> 00:39:21,280
The Klingons must have
sold us out.

740
00:39:21,315 --> 00:39:23,343
Prepare to engage warp engines.

741
00:39:23,387 --> 00:39:24,913
There's nowhere to run, Tahna.

742
00:39:25,024 --> 00:39:26,186
We don't have to go far.

743
00:39:32,842 --> 00:39:34,813
I should have known.

744
00:39:34,847 --> 00:39:37,114
Now set the course for DS9.

745
00:39:37,153 --> 00:39:38,713
No.

746
00:39:38,757 --> 00:39:41,730
If you don't, I'll explode
the bomb right here and destroy

747
00:39:41,764 --> 00:39:43,495
all six colonies on Bajor VIII.

748
00:39:43,535 --> 00:39:46,599
You would kill thousands
of your own people for this?

749
00:39:46,643 --> 00:39:48,637
The question is
whether you would kill them

750
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,149
by refusing to set the course.

751
00:40:01,645 --> 00:40:03,114
They've gone to warp.

752
00:40:03,149 --> 00:40:04,448
Follow them.

753
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:06,821
<i>Ganges</i> to <i>Yangtzee Kiang.</i>

754
00:40:06,858 --> 00:40:10,994
Drop out of warp,
or we'll open fire.

755
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:13,437
Repeat:
Reduce your power immediately

756
00:40:13,473 --> 00:40:14,908
or we will open fire.

757
00:40:14,943 --> 00:40:18,679
I doubt he'll shoot
while his Major is on board

758
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:20,211
but just in case...

759
00:40:20,257 --> 00:40:22,057
This is the voice
of the <i>Kohn-Ma.</i>

760
00:40:22,161 --> 00:40:24,530
There is an armed
bilitrium explosive device

761
00:40:24,567 --> 00:40:25,557
on board this ship.

762
00:40:25,602 --> 00:40:29,168
Fire on us,
and you will detonate it.

763
00:40:29,211 --> 00:40:32,481
If that device goes off
while they're at warp

764
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:34,547
they'll spread radiation
across half the system.

765
00:40:34,591 --> 00:40:36,083
He's headed straight back
to the station.

766
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,430
This is the Federation
Vessel <i>Ganges</i>

767
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:42,704
to the Cardassian
Warship <i>Aldara.</i>

768
00:40:42,743 --> 00:40:47,083
So... we're finally allies,
Commander.

769
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,316
Gul Danar

770
00:40:48,357 --> 00:40:50,122
the Federation Runabout
<i>Yangtzee Kiang</i>

771
00:40:50,161 --> 00:40:52,098
is carrying an explosive
bilitrium device.

772
00:40:52,132 --> 00:40:53,601
Can you intercept

773
00:40:53,636 --> 00:40:55,607
before it reaches
the space station?

774
00:40:55,641 --> 00:40:58,135
Our time to intercept
is two minutes, 14 seconds.

775
00:40:58,214 --> 00:40:59,877
That's about a minute
too late, Commander.

776
00:40:59,918 --> 00:41:02,389
If I may take
this opportunity to say

777
00:41:02,424 --> 00:41:04,053
that I warned you...

778
00:41:04,095 --> 00:41:06,566
Can we get them
in a tractor beam?

779
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,035
Not at these speeds.

780
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:10,041
They have 27 seconds on us.

781
00:41:10,075 --> 00:41:12,604
We may have to shoot
them down, Commander.

782
00:41:12,649 --> 00:41:14,620
Ready photons, Chief.

783
00:41:14,654 --> 00:41:17,023
We'll fire as soon
as they slow to impulse.

784
00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:18,221
Aye, sir.

785
00:41:25,211 --> 00:41:28,777
100,000 kilometers to DS9.

786
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,622
This is your idea
of a nonviolent solution?

787
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,631
You realize there are hundreds

788
00:41:33,665 --> 00:41:35,932
of Bajoran civilians
aboard the station?

789
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:38,441
No one's going to be hurt, Kira.

790
00:41:38,477 --> 00:41:41,382
Adjust your course
to take a vectored approach

791
00:41:41,417 --> 00:41:43,946
past the mouth of the wormhole.

792
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:45,152
The wormhole...

793
00:41:45,193 --> 00:41:48,634
It's not the space station
you're after.

794
00:41:48,668 --> 00:41:50,639
You can't possibly believe
you can destroy

795
00:41:50,673 --> 00:41:52,610
the wormhole with that device?

796
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:55,310
I don't have to destroy it...
just collapse the entrance.

797
00:41:55,351 --> 00:41:58,655
You're only hurting Bajor
by doing this, Tahna.

798
00:41:58,692 --> 00:42:00,686
No more wormhole

799
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:03,966
no more Federation
or Cardassians...

800
00:42:04,005 --> 00:42:06,306
or anyone.

801
00:42:06,344 --> 00:42:09,121
Drop out of warp.

802
00:42:09,254 --> 00:42:10,153
Now!

803
00:42:15,135 --> 00:42:16,798
My God, they're going
into the wormhole

804
00:42:16,839 --> 00:42:18,069
at full impulse.

805
00:43:05,355 --> 00:43:06,847
Damn you.

806
00:43:06,893 --> 00:43:08,453
Sisko to Kira.

807
00:43:08,496 --> 00:43:10,694
Are you all right, Major?

808
00:43:10,802 --> 00:43:13,707
No, she's not all right,
Commander!

809
00:43:13,775 --> 00:43:16,612
And if you want her alive,
you'll do exactly as I say!

810
00:43:16,649 --> 00:43:18,209
Listen to me carefully, Tahna.

811
00:43:18,252 --> 00:43:20,553
You can either surrender now,
to me

812
00:43:20,592 --> 00:43:23,360
or you can wait
for the Cardassian warship

813
00:43:23,399 --> 00:43:26,497
and I can let them
deal with you this time.

814
00:43:26,539 --> 00:43:27,564
Your choice.

815
00:43:42,979 --> 00:43:46,351
There'll be no further
resistance, Commander.

816
00:44:02,225 --> 00:44:03,888
Tahna...

817
00:44:03,929 --> 00:44:06,230
the old ways don't work anymore.

818
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:08,432
Everything is different now.

819
00:44:08,473 --> 00:44:10,774
I had to do this.

820
00:44:10,812 --> 00:44:12,806
One day, you'll understand.

821
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,148
Traitor.
