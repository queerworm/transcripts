1
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:11,219
Do you need me, Julian?

2
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:12,763
How did you know
it was me?

3
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:14,890
There are different ways
to recognize someone.

4
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,767
The rhythm of their steps,
for example.

5
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,769
You are remarkable.

6
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:21,897
Julian, you and I
need to have a talk

7
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:23,941
about Trills
and relationships.

8
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:25,985
Fine. We'll do
it over supper.

9
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:28,236
Quark has found me this
delightfully dry champagne,

10
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:29,488
estate bottled
on Korris I.

11
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:32,950
Julian...
What is this?

12
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,994
An Altonian brain teaser.

13
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:36,912
A brain teaser?

14
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:38,205
A puzzle.

15
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,165
A puzzle?
Mmm.

16
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,585
I love puzzles.

17
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,921
How does it work?

18
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:48,173
It responds
to neural theta waves.

19
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:51,301
The goal is to turn the sphere
into a solid color.

20
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,511
And that's all?

21
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:53,679
That's all.

22
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,723
I've been trying
to master it

23
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:58,893
on and off for,
oh, 140 years.

24
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:01,812
Would you care to try?

25
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,522
Yes.

26
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:05,816
Just sit comfortably.

27
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:10,320
And release your tension
into my hands.

28
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,322
Your hands, they're cold.

29
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,074
It's a peculiarity
of the Trill.

30
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,617
Cold hands, warm heart.

31
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,619
Concentrate
on the sphere.

32
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,496
Clear your mind.

33
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:22,958
This requires focus
and clarity of thought.

34
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,084
I understand completely.

35
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:27,462
What is that exotic scent
you're wearing?

36
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,048
Focus

37
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:31,008
and clarity of thought.

38
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:33,260
Yes, yes,
I have it.

39
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,804
I'm going to release it
to you now, okay?

40
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,182
Okay.

41
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,475
Computer...

42
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:44,145
transfer control
to second player.

43
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:53,405
I think your mind
is still a little
busy, Julian.

44
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:55,908
Well... So, are you
free for supper?

45
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:56,909
(<i> door opening</i> )

46
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:57,910
Ready, Dax?

47
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,578
Sorry.

48
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,080
Perhaps another time.

49
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,331
Maybe you'd like
to try again.

50
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:05,000
Doctor.

51
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:11,090
Computer...

52
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,883
reset.

53
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,300
(<i> conversation and laughter</i> )

54
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,847
Business is good, Quark.

55
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:26,307
You're almost making
an honest living.

56
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,227
A lot of new faces.

57
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:31,897
Hmm.

58
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:34,942
The wormhole does bring
them our way, doesn't it?

59
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:38,403
Everyone wants a piece
of the new frontier.

60
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,572
And I'm sure you've
already tried

61
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,365
to sell it to
a few of them.

62
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,325
O'BRIEN:
We made the decision together.

63
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,493
KEIKO:
That's not true.

64
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,162
That's not true.
What?

65
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,706
You decided and asked
me to agree with it.

66
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:53,668
Grapevine says Chief O'Brien
and the missus

67
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,463
are having problems.

68
00:04:56,463 --> 00:05:01,635
I'll never understand
the humanoid need to...

69
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,262
couple.

70
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:08,475
You've never... coupled?

71
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:09,977
Choose not to.

72
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,645
Too many compromises.

73
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:14,606
You want to watch the
Karo-Net tournament.

74
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,984
She wants to
listen to music.

75
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,652
So, you compromise.

76
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,279
You listen to music.

77
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:23,740
You like Earth jazz.
She prefers Klingon opera.

78
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,450
So, you compromise.

79
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,828
You listen to
Klingon opera.

80
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,537
So, here you were

81
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:33,834
ready to have a nice night
watching the Karo-Net match

82
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,461
and you wind up spending
an agonizing evening

83
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,379
listening to Klingon opera.

84
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,840
KEIKO:
That's exactly...

85
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,177
Keiko, sit down.

86
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:45,095
I didn't mean...

87
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,388
What<i> could</i> they
be going on about

88
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:48,765
like that, anyway?

89
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,558
She doesn't like it here.

90
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:53,728
Mmm. Who does?

91
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,605
(<i> footsteps</i> )

92
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,822
Ah...

93
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:06,533
Huh. Don't even
think about it.

94
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,286
I can<i> so</i> think about it.

95
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:12,497
You might as well try
to find a drink of water

96
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,415
on the Yadozi Desert.

97
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:17,127
Besides, I'd say
our new Commander

98
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:18,753
is interested in her.

99
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,547
Not at all.

100
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:25,093
I know for a fact
that when she was a he--

101
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:29,264
you know,
before she got
this new body--

102
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:30,974
they were old friends.

103
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,851
Things change.

104
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,061
(<i> laughs knowingly</i> )

105
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,354
MAN:
All right, now here we go.

106
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,901
How long has he been here?

107
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,320
All right, one more time.

108
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,990
He came in on a
transport last night.

109
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,658
Oh...

110
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,451
Something
to eat?

111
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,870
Just steamed azna.

112
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,666
Well, some things
are still the same.

113
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,793
If you'd listen to me,

114
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,504
you would eat
steamed azna, too.

115
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,173
Dax, did I ever tell you
about the meals

116
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,466
my father used to cook for us
when we were children?

117
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,261
All the time.

118
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:10,638
Every night in my house,
my dad insisted

119
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:13,392
that we have supper together
as a family.

120
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:15,810
He would try out
his new recipes on us.

121
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,021
He used to call us
his test tasters.

122
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,815
Steamed azna would put
years on your life.

123
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,568
Dax, I don't want years
on my life

124
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:26,321
if I can only eat
steamed azna.

125
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,907
SautÃ©ed...

126
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:32,286
rolloped, fricasseed-- fine.

127
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:34,329
But not steamed.

128
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:41,002
I've missed your steamed azna.

129
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,800
You must miss Curzon, too.

130
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,552
He was...

131
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,889
you were, are...

132
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,059
a mentor,
another father to me.

133
00:07:56,059 --> 00:08:00,355
This happens to Trills,
Benjamin.

134
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:04,276
Sometimes our friendships
with other species don't survive

135
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:06,320
because of the change.

136
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,613
It won't be that way with us.

137
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,325
It's just a little uncomfortable
right now.

138
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:14,828
I suggest
that you allow yourself

139
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:18,373
to feel comfortable
with your discomfort.

140
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,250
Time can do the rest.

141
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,669
KEIKO:
I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

142
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,087
O'BRIEN: Keiko...

143
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,558
Dabo!

144
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,978
(<i> laughing</i> )

145
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,438
All right.

146
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,569
I don't want you
on this station.

147
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,238
Yeah, well, that's too bad

148
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,449
because I have
every right to be here.

149
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,616
I decide who has rights

150
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,576
and who doesn't
on this Promenade.

151
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:58,246
You better ask your Federation
superiors about that one.

152
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,332
I don't have to check
with anyone.

153
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:16,097
You have 26 hours
to get off this station.

154
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,233
Look, I'm willing
to ask for a transfer

155
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,859
if that will
make you happy.

156
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,610
That's not fair either.

157
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,072
You'd have to give up
your promotion.

158
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,656
Not necessarily.

159
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,825
I wish I knew the
right thing to do.

160
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,494
I'm just lost here.

161
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:40,121
Starfleet doesn't need a
botanist on this station.

162
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,040
Keiko, there's
a whole new quadrant

163
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,000
on the other side
of the wormhole

164
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,960
full of new plant life
to explore.

165
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,879
And ships going
to explore it

166
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,215
and I'm not on
any of them.

167
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,467
We'll be sending runabouts
through the wormhole.

168
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:53,801
I'll see to it
you get to go.

169
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,054
I don't need
favors from you.

170
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,181
I just need to be useful.

171
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,686
Just think how much
more attractive

172
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,772
this place could
be if you planted

173
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,024
some trees and flowers
in the Promenade.

174
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,901
You could even
create an arboretum

175
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,819
from the new specimens
we bring back

176
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,447
from the Gamma Quadrant.

177
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,204
Do you really want
to raise your daughter

178
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,290
in this place, Miles?

179
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,375
Kira to O'Brien.

180
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,668
Go ahead.

181
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:30,797
We have a nonfunctional power
transfer grid on level five.

182
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:35,093
All of the upper docking pylons
are out of commission.

183
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:36,761
On my way.

184
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,524
JAKE: Hi!

185
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,526
What do you want, hu-man?

186
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:53,153
My name's Jake.

187
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,654
I know who you are.

188
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,281
What's yours?

189
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,949
Why do<i> you</i> care?

190
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:00,743
Not exactly a lot of friends
to choose from around here.

191
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,078
You know what I mean.

192
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:06,416
Nog.

193
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,084
My name is Nog.

194
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:13,840
His name is Ibudan.

195
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,426
He used to run
black market goods through here

196
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:19,012
to the surface during
the Cardassian occupation,

197
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,139
gouging his fellow men

198
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,350
who needed medical supplies
and so forth.

199
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,353
Some Bajorans actually
considered him a hero,

200
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:30,273
but I saw him let a child die
when the parents couldn't afford

201
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,108
the drug that would have
saved her life.

202
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,693
A few years back,
he killed

203
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,655
a Cardassian officer

204
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:39,324
who wanted a payoff
to look the other way.

205
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,576
He went to prison for murder.

206
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,077
I sent him there.

207
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,455
For murder?
What's he doing out?

208
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,790
The provisional government
let him go.

209
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,543
Killing a Cardassian

210
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:52,212
isn't considered
much of a crime nowadays.

211
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,964
Doesn't sound like there's
much we can do about it.

212
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,757
I can get him off my Promenade.

213
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:59,219
If he hasn't done anything wrong

214
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,262
you can't just arbitrarily
force him to leave.

215
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:04,641
Watch me.
Mr. Odo,

216
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:07,977
you're not going to take the law
into your own hands.

217
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,646
The law?

218
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:13,358
Commander, laws change
depending on who's making them.

219
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:16,152
Cardassians one day,
Federation the next.

220
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,572
But justice is justice,

221
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:19,656
and as long as I'm

222
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:20,990
in charge of security--

223
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,950
If you can't work
within the rules

224
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,494
I'll find someone who can.

225
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,886
(<i> birds and insects chirping)</i>

226
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,749
(<i> sighs</i> )

227
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:12,709
(<i> chuckles</i> )

228
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,688
What are they?

229
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:37,692
Garanian bolites.

230
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:38,943
Come on!

231
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,949
I guess I know
the competition now.

232
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,785
What are you talking
about, Julian?

233
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:49,329
Well, did you have
a nice dinner with
Commander Sisko?

234
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,038
Julian, Trills do not
look for romance

235
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,290
the same way humans do.

236
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,501
In fact, we find it
quite a nuisance.

237
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,210
What? A nuisance?

238
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,297
It's a weakness of the young,
and although a Trill host

239
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:01,633
may have these...
feelings occasionally

240
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:04,135
it is our wish
to live on a higher plane,

241
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:07,138
to try to rise above
these kinds of temptations.

242
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:09,015
You said<i> "try</i> to rise above,"

243
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,518
which suggests you
don't always succeed.

244
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:12,811
Julian...

245
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:14,771
Sisko to Dr. Bashir.

246
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,063
Go ahead.

247
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,357
We need medical assistance

248
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,150
above the bar
in Holosuite Four.

249
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,652
Acknowledged, Commander.

250
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:22,236
I still have that champagne.

251
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,282
On ice.

252
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:36,042
WOMAN:
Are you done
with your shift?

253
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,961
MAN:
Just got off,
as a matter of fact.

254
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,643
(<i> both shuddering</i> )

255
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,978
(<i> laughing</i> )

256
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,363
Help us!

257
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:06,573
Somebody help us!

258
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:07,866
Something is
happening to us!

259
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:08,908
Get a doctor!

260
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,619
(<i> laughing</i> )

261
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,873
Oh!

262
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,169
(<i> embarrassed chuckle</i> )

263
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,050
(<i> clears throat</i> )

264
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,846
(<i> both laughing</i> )

265
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:46,195
ODO:
The door opened only twice.

266
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:50,825
The first time when the computer
logged Ibudan's check-in

267
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:53,035
at 1700 hours, 16 minutes.

268
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:56,623
The suite was secured,
so no one else could enter.

269
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:59,709
He ran Lauriento massage
holoprogram #101A.

270
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,419
13 minutes later

271
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:04,046
the door was opened
for the second time

272
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,591
but since Ibudan
obviously didn't exit

273
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:09,510
we have to assume
that's when the killer left.

274
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,179
Any evidence of a beam-in
during those 13 minutes?

275
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,933
No.
Well then,
how did the killer get in?

276
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:18,185
He might have entered
the holosuite the
same time Ibudan did.

277
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,480
BASHIR:
Cause of death's
no mystery.

278
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,148
The knife was thrust

279
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,275
directly between the left
and right thoracic vertebrae

280
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,235
perforating the lower ventricle
of the heart.

281
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,154
The murderer apparently
had a decent knowledge

282
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,572
of Bajoran anatomy.

283
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,282
Doctor, I want you

284
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:33,284
to look for evidence
that could establish

285
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:34,994
that someone was
in here with him.

286
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,746
I'll do a sweep
for hair follicles

287
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:39,248
any skin or cellular
remnants and DNA fragments.

288
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,251
How many ships have
left since yesterday?

289
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,920
Hmm, two.

290
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,381
A Federation survey ship
and a Vulcan science vessel.

291
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,925
Advise all
ships in dock

292
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,885
that departures
will be delayed

293
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:52,178
until further notice.

294
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,110
And they were just looking
for trouble.

295
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,698
Those kids had no reason to be
hanging around the Promenade.

296
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,200
It's about the
only place they
have to go.

297
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,243
We can't keep them
locked in their rooms.

298
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,037
This isn't like
a starship, Miles.

299
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,623
The kind of freedom children
have on the<i> Enterprise</i>

300
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,792
just won't work
on a space station.

301
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:25,712
There are too many ways to get
into serious trouble here.

302
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:28,214
What this place needs
is a school.

303
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:38,808
All ships have been informed
of the delays, Commander.
Major,

304
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:42,353
do you know
Mr. Zayra, who operates
the Transit Aid Center?

305
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:43,813
We've met.

306
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,398
He was just telling me
something disturbing.

307
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,858
I think
you should hear it.

308
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:49,694
It's just that the
murdered man, Ibudan--

309
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:50,945
I spoke to him yesterday

310
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,655
about an hour
before it happened.

311
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:53,740
Where was this?

312
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,741
Quark's.

313
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,076
By the dabo table.

314
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,204
It was after his struggle
with the shape-shifter.

315
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:03,875
He told me that
he was scared.

316
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:07,420
He was afraid that
Odo would kill him.

317
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,298
There isn't a more honorable man

318
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:13,384
on this station
than the Constable.

319
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:14,510
Maybe so.

320
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,933
All I know is, an hour
later, Ibudan was dead.

321
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,862
Computer, lights.

322
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:35,573
This was
Ibudan's quarters.

323
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:38,200
Feel free
to look around.

324
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,953
Double accommodations?

325
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,454
That's what
he requested,

326
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,414
but only one passenger
was logged in.

327
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:46,042
He probably just wanted
larger quarters.

328
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,335
If there's anything
else you need...

329
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,546
I want a record of all
the passengers onboard.

330
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,506
Of course.

331
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,717
I'll get you
a copy of the
ship's manifest.

332
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:01,348
Computer, how many entries
made from this terminal

333
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,350
during the last 78 hours?

334
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:06,228
Seven entries noted
in personal calendar files.

335
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,688
Show them to me.

336
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:14,570
Take me to Stardate 46384.

337
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:37,551
You won't get any argument
from me, Mrs. O'Brien.

338
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:40,013
When I heard what happened
this morning on the Promenade...

339
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,555
We weren't doing
anything.

340
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,017
I don't want to talk
about this now.

341
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,060
It's this Ferengi boy, Nog--

342
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,353
Jake won't be having

343
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:50,148
anything more
to do with him.

344
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:52,525
He's the only one here
even close to my age.

345
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,694
That's not exactly true, Jake.

346
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:55,945
There are 12 other
children onboard

347
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:58,114
ranging from eight to 16.

348
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:02,076
The problem is, there's no
structured activity for them.

349
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:06,288
Don't you miss the schools
you used to go to, Jake?

350
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,791
No... I guess.

351
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,793
Studying alone
on the computer,

352
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:13,087
it kind of gets
boring sometimes.

353
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:15,715
KEIKO:
You know, I've never actually
been a teacher, Commander,

354
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:18,968
but it's something I've
always thought about doing.

355
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,636
As a Starfleet Commander
and a father

356
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,930
I think it's a terrific idea.
What do you need?

357
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,264
Uh...

358
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,850
some space.

359
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,060
We'll find it.

360
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,855
Computers?
You'll have them.

361
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,776
I hope you realize
what you're getting
yourself into.

362
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,529
I can't force the Bajora,
the Ferengi or anyone else

363
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,489
to send their children
to your school.

364
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,657
And even if
they do come

365
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,409
everyone has a
different culture,

366
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,203
a different
philosophy.

367
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:47,496
I know I'll have to come up
with an innovative program

368
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,456
but I can't imagine any parent

369
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:52,543
not welcoming the news
of a school opening here.

370
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:54,294
Thank you,
Commander.

371
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,262
If I<i> hear</i> of you
hanging around with him...

372
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,933
I thought you didn't want
to talk about this now.

373
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:12,396
These are the DNA
sequence analyses,

374
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:15,357
the cellular spectrographs,
and the particulate
matter tracers.

375
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,443
I asked Lieutenant Dax
to confirm my findings,

376
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,153
and I'm afraid
she concurs.

377
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:22,865
There were no new DNA traces
found in the holosuite.

378
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:25,534
You're saying nobody went
into the room with him.

379
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,661
Well, apart from those of us
who were in there

380
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:31,373
<i>after</i> the body was discovered,
this was the only DNA present.

381
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,794
And we've identified
it as Ibudan's.
Wait a minute.

382
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:37,130
Ibudan goes into
the holosuite alone.

383
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,049
Locks the door.
Nobody transports in.

384
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,217
A few minutes later,
he's murdered.

385
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,635
How is that possible?

386
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:43,803
ODO:
It's not...

387
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,638
unless the murder was committed

388
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,766
by someone who could get through
the cracks in the door.

389
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:51,435
Say... a shape-shifter.

390
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,453
It's a pretty
neat package.

391
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,664
His calendar shows he was
planning to meet with me

392
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,582
at the time
of the murder.

393
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:16,169
No one except a shape-shifter
could get into the holosuite.

394
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:17,962
And since I'd obviously
be called there

395
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:19,505
after the body
was discovered,

396
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:22,216
traces of my DNA wind up
at the scene of the crime.

397
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:24,551
Do you have any
kind of an alibi?

398
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:27,138
Major, I have to return
to my natural state

399
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:29,473
every 18 hours
to regenerate.

400
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,267
To be quite honest
about it,

401
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:34,020
I was in a pail
in the back of my office

402
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,646
when Ibudan was killed.

403
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:38,649
The killer might have known
your regenerative cycle

404
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:40,734
and planned the
murder accordingly.

405
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:44,155
Like I said,
a neat package.

406
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:47,574
Who might want to
frame you for murder?

407
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:50,410
I can think of
about 500 different people,

408
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:54,040
but I haven't seen any of them
around the station recently.

409
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:59,170
Do you think
that Federation doctor

410
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:02,673
could do a sweep
of Ibudan's quarters for me?

411
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:04,008
See if he can find out

412
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:06,426
if somebody else was using
that second bed?

413
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:09,347
I'll send him over
there right away.

414
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,142
Thank you, Major.

415
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,482
Dabo!

416
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,818
You want<i> my</i> boy to go
to a Federation school?

417
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,362
Not just Federation.

418
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:26,404
I'm developing
a curriculum

419
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:28,406
that will take
a much broader approach.

420
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:29,992
Little lady,
little lady.

421
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:32,661
What do you know
of Ferengi education?

422
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,956
I understand you
employ a work-study
approach, Mr. Rom,

423
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:38,125
with apprenticeships
in a wide range

424
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,418
of business
and economic fields.

425
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:41,921
(<i> laughing</i> )

426
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:44,757
We throw them into the
cutthroat competition

427
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,300
of Ferengi commerce

428
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,928
and anyone who
survives, graduates.

429
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:51,013
Are you prepared
to teach<i> that</i> to my son?

430
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:53,933
I'm sure I couldn't improve on
what you've already taught him

431
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,226
in that department.

432
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:56,852
Thank you.
Thank you.

433
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,771
I've taught him
everything I know.

434
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:00,940
It's so important
that we prepare our youths

435
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,816
for the challenges
of the future.

436
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,026
Exactly.

437
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,403
Consider the advantage

438
00:24:05,403 --> 00:24:07,696
your son will have
over other Ferengi

439
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,949
once he's learned
about other cultures--

440
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,658
once he's learned
how others

441
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,411
run their economies,

442
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:15,413
conduct business,
negotiate...

443
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:18,207
You will teach my son
these things?

444
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:19,792
Knowledge is power,
Mr. Rom.

445
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,377
It can't work.

446
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,337
He will not listen
to you.

447
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:25,381
Why not?

448
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:26,673
You are female.

449
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,008
So?

450
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,802
My son cannot
learn anything

451
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,720
from a female
human teacher.

452
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,097
Let him try it
for a few weeks.

453
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:36,142
He has nothing to lose
and so much to gain.

454
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:37,810
I don't think so.

455
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,979
Will you at least
think about it?

456
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:41,272
Yes, yes, of course.

457
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:43,065
Now, really,
I'm quite busy.

458
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:44,566
Place your wagers,

459
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:45,985
place your wagers.

460
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,987
Get this lovely
young woman

461
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,447
a drink.

462
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:51,115
What do we really
know about him anyway?

463
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:52,658
He's not one of us.

464
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:54,243
He isn't<i> one</i> of anything.

465
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,369
(<i> chuckling</i> )

466
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:57,246
You know what
really bothers me?

467
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,623
This shifter was the
last Chief of Security

468
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,875
when the Cardassians
were here.

469
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,586
Yeah, he's the one
who caught Ibudan for them.

470
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,422
Why is he still Security Chief?

471
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:07,756
You're right.

472
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,801
We ought to talk
to Major Kira.

473
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:12,928
Nobody knows him
like I know him.

474
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,596
Let me tell you
something.

475
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:18,267
He's an ill-tempered,
overbearing crosspatch.

476
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,811
But he was no
Cardassian
collaborator

477
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:22,438
and he's no killer.

478
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:25,565
I can't believe you're
defending him, Quark.

479
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,443
You're his worst enemy.

480
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:29,236
Guess that's
the closest thing

481
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,280
he has in this
world to a friend.

482
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,781
(<i> chuckles</i> )

483
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:39,663
(<i> men laughing</i> )

484
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,126
MAN:
Security, huh?

485
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:46,879
(<i> laughing</i> )

486
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:08,775
(<i> whirring</i> )

487
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,359
Listen, I hear
what you're saying.

488
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,194
I understand your concerns.

489
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:54,780
We're not saying whether
he's innocent or guilty,
Commander.

490
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,198
All we're saying...

491
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:58,033
Isn't it reasonable
under the circumstances...

492
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,453
Thank you very
much for coming.

493
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,676
(<i> indistinct voices</i> )

494
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:22,724
Oh, this is wrong.

495
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,227
SISKO:
And what would you
suggest we do?

496
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:26,979
He didn't do it.

497
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:29,315
The man we have in charge
of a murder investigation

498
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:30,774
is the prime suspect, Major.

499
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,901
Those people have
a right to complain.

500
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,279
DAX:
Even if he's innocent,

501
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,738
it could still seem like

502
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:39,699
a conflict of
interest, Kira.

503
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:42,286
You're going to relieve him
of duty.

504
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:44,121
I don't see
any other choice.

505
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:47,625
He has been completely candid
about this investigation.

506
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:50,794
He could have covered his tracks
half a dozen times already

507
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,421
if he were guilty.

508
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:54,881
I appreciate
how you feel,

509
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:56,967
but the decision stands.

510
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:58,927
I'll inform him myself.

511
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,640
(<i> sighs</i> )

512
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:07,186
The only curious thing I found
were these seofurance fragments

513
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,686
near the matter
reclamation unit.

514
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:09,729
Dish, please.

515
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:14,193
It appears he was trying
to get rid of them.

516
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:15,902
Do you have any idea
what they're from?

517
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,404
I know exactly
what they're from.

518
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,614
A biological
sample container.

519
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,616
I use them all the time.

520
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:21,867
What would Ibudan
be doing

521
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,577
with a biological
sample container?

522
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:24,995
Well, that I'm
not so sure about,

523
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:26,664
but when I analyzed
the fragments

524
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:29,707
I detected traces
of a complex organic structure.

525
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:31,043
Translate, Doctor.

526
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:33,170
It suggests Ibudan may
have been conducting

527
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:36,382
some sort of medical
experiment on board his ship.

528
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:38,676
He wasn't a doctor
or a scientist.

529
00:28:38,676 --> 00:28:40,802
Well, let's see
what a standard

530
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,888
electrophoretic
analysis tells us.

531
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:52,022
What the...?

532
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:55,234
The complex proteins
are breaking down
into DNA fragments.

533
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,027
Now what does that mean?

534
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:58,529
It means...

535
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:00,822
we should set up
a bio-regenerative field

536
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,492
to accelerate
the cellular development.

537
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:05,869
If I can reconstruct
the DNA sequence

538
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,414
it might just give us
an idea what he was up to.

539
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:09,623
Sisko to Odo.

540
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:10,916
Here.

541
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:13,293
May I see you
in my office, please?

542
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,503
Acknowledged.

543
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,485
Commander?

544
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,070
Sit down.

545
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:48,036
I am temporarily
relieving you of duty.

546
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:51,749
I'm sure the reasons
are obvious.

547
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:55,127
Who will be taking over
the investigation?

548
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,713
I've placed Major Kira
and Lieutenant Dax in charge.

549
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:03,677
Will that be all, Commander?

550
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:06,680
I want you to know
I don't personally believe

551
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,099
that you're responsible
for this.

552
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:11,769
Really?

553
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:14,647
Now, how can that be true?

554
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:17,441
You don't know me.

555
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:20,444
You have no reason to believe
I wouldn't kill Ibudan

556
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:22,237
if it suited my fancy.

557
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:25,991
So don't tell me there isn't
some doubt inside of you--

558
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:28,494
some question
about whether or not

559
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:30,162
I murdered the man.

560
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,331
I simply feel
that putting Kira and Dax

561
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:34,040
in charge of the investigation

562
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,834
will be in everyone's
best interest,

563
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,504
including your own.

564
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:41,715
I'll take care
of my own best interests.

565
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:57,147
MAN 1:
That's him.

566
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:59,149
(<i> indistinct voices</i> )

567
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:02,319
MAN 2:
Yeah, they found his DNA...

568
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:38,230
(<i> fragments dropping</i> )

569
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,357
I can find out
who did it for you.

570
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:42,984
Not for me.

571
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,403
Tell it to Starfleet.

572
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:46,613
I'm not in charge
here any longer.

573
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:51,117
Well now, there's a piece
of good news to brighten my day.

574
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,411
You better take advantage

575
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,162
of my absence while
you can, Quark.

576
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,707
Oh, I will, I will.
Count on it.

577
00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:59,835
I'll have every
confidence man in the sector

578
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:00,836
onboard by tomorrow.

579
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:01,920
You do and I'll...

580
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,046
What?

581
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,131
You're going
to get sloppy

582
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:07,634
without me to keep
an eye on you.

583
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,428
I don't think so.

584
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:12,598
You've kept me on my toes
for far too long now.

585
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,349
Sure.

586
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:17,185
I've turned you
into a better crook.

587
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,937
Like it or not.

588
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,230
(<i> chuckling</i> )

589
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:25,611
Quark, think you could use

590
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:29,406
a shape-shifter
in your organization?

591
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,827
Uh...

592
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:37,080
(<i> chuckles</i> )

593
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,832
You had me going.

594
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:40,793
(<i> laughing</i> )

595
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:42,628
I did, didn't I?

596
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:44,045
Yes, you did.

597
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:47,132
(<i> both chuckling</i> )

598
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,513
You know, I've been
asking some friends

599
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:57,100
at Kran-Tobol Prison
about Ibudan--

600
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:01,020
whether he made any enemies
while he was there.

601
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,731
Couldn't find any.

602
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:06,192
Mostly he stayed around
the Bajoran dissidents

603
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:08,695
that the Cardassians locked up.

604
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:21,040
(<i> door closes</i> )

605
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,462
It's growing exponentially.

606
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:28,340
We're going to have to increase
the metabolic field energy.

607
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,592
Just what<i> is</i> it
that's growing in there?

608
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:32,511
Aren't those DNA patterns
humanoid, Julian?

609
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,429
Well, that's what
it looks like to me,

610
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:37,641
but there's a genetic drift
I can't quite put my finger on.

611
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:39,142
What<i> was</i> Ibudan up to?

612
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,644
We're going to have
to wait and see

613
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:42,646
what this becomes
before we have a clue.

614
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:44,272
You can transfer it
to the larger field now.

615
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:45,357
WOMAN:
Yes, Doctor.

616
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:46,733
Care for lunch?

617
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,109
Sure.

618
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,486
No, thank you.

619
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:51,738
Major Kira's waiting
for my report.

620
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:04,209
Just how many different lives
do you think she's led?

621
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:05,794
I don't even know.

622
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:09,840
He'll go--<i> she'll</i> go
through a list of them,

623
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,384
then out comes another one
in a later conversation.

624
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:15,428
I'd guess that Jadzia
is probably the sixth host.

625
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,472
Has she changed much?
Changed?

626
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,392
From the last
one. Curzon Dax.

627
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:23,269
I understand a Trill
integrates the personality

628
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:24,897
of each new host.

629
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:27,858
I guess I'll have
to find that out.

630
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:31,069
If I were to tell you
some of the mischief

631
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,321
he and I used to get into...

632
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,074
There was a time when
I was no older than you are

633
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:39,912
we were attending the running
of the Rujian Steeplechase.

634
00:34:39,912 --> 00:34:41,580
Dax loves the races.

635
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,123
Anyway, there were
these gorgeous, seven-foot

636
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:46,543
Ruji twin sisters
that Curzon knew.

637
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:48,127
And he and I--

638
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:57,303
I guess we won't be doing that
again soon, will we?

639
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,347
You care for her
a great deal, don't you?

640
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,811
Dax and I
are just friends, Doctor.

641
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:08,523
If you're interested,
you have nothing to fear
from me.

642
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:11,068
I mean,
if I were in your shoes

643
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:13,779
knowing Dax
as intimately as you do

644
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:16,573
I think I'd find her
hard to resist.

645
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:18,742
You don't understand, Doctor.

646
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:21,369
Dax used to beat me
regularly at bare fist

647
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,121
Juro Counterpunch.

648
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:26,416
Well, I guess you won't be doing
that again soon either.

649
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:28,376
MAN:
Let's get out of here.

650
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:31,463
No, I'm not drinking
with scum.

651
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,381
I won't drink
near this man.

652
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,591
Come on, let's go.

653
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:53,443
Yeah, in a semicircle here
facing the module.

654
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:55,320
That's right.

655
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,114
Thank you.

656
00:36:01,118 --> 00:36:03,120
Ah.
Here's Mommy.

657
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,538
Where have you been,
Mommy?

658
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,248
I've been getting ready
for school tomorrow, honey.

659
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:10,168
Can I come to school?
Oh, I wish you could.

660
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:13,046
At least then I'd know
one student would be coming.

661
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:14,255
(<i> sighs</i> )

662
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,715
But you have
to wait a year or two.

663
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,092
How's it going?

664
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:18,426
We'll be ready
in time.

665
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,053
In time for what,
I'm not sure.

666
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:21,721
Aside from Commander Sisko,

667
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,348
we haven't had
a firm commitment

668
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:24,683
from any of the parents.

669
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,018
What's this?

670
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:27,936
Just a little something
I replicated

671
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:29,312
on the way over.

672
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,814
Help Mommy to open
her present, Molly.

673
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:31,857
(<i> chuckles</i> )

674
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:33,608
Come on.

675
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,276
Yeah, go on.

676
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,779
Ooh. Pull.

677
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:41,282
Oh, Miles.

(<i> bell dings</i> )

679
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,828
Thank you.

680
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:46,913
I want to see
you standing

681
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,498
in the Promenade
tomorrow morning

682
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:50,333
ringing your school bell.

685
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:56,464
I better take her home.

Don't you know where
you're not wanted?

689
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:04,556
There he is. Get him.

690
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,725
Murderer!
Shape-shifting freak!

691
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:10,020
(<i> shouting</i> )

692
00:37:18,195 --> 00:37:19,654
You freak!

693
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,573
O'Brien to Ops.

694
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,825
Security to the Promenade,
on the double.

695
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:25,952
Acknowledged.

696
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:29,831
Yes, sir.

697
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:31,499
O'Brien to Sisko.

698
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,626
I'm here, Chief.
What's going on?

699
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,628
We've got a crowd--
more like a mob--

700
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,172
outside Odo's office.

701
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:39,716
You better get down here.

702
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:43,636
(<i> angry yelling</i> )

703
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:09,537

Shape-shifter!

707
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,420
Murdering shifter!

708
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,714
Shape-shifter!

709
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:23,802
Odo's inside?

710
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:25,553
Yes, sir. He went in
a few minutes ago.

711
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,305
The crowd followed him
from the bar.

712
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,015
I want more security here,
and I want them armed.

713
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,267
Aye, sir.

714
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:31,726
It's going to be harder
to control them

715
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:32,769
if the numbers keep growing.

716
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:34,020
We can secure all turbolifts--

717
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,730
slow down the traffic
onto the Promenade.

718
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,398
Good idea.

719
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:43,404
(<i> angry shouting</i> )

720
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:49,077
DAX:
Julian,
look at this.

721
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:51,997
The chromatin pattern's
changing.

722
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:54,457
It's definitely humanoid.

723
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,293
It's definitely humanoid.

724
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:02,632
It's definitely...
My God!

725
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:04,717
Dax, I think I know what it is.

726
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,636
Run a chromosome analysis.

727
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:09,222
I think we're going to find
a gene-sequence degradation.

728
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:23,903
(<i> chanting</i> ):
Shifter! Shifter!
Shifter!

729
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:28,700
Shifter! Shifter! Shifter!
Shifter!

730
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:32,620
Coming through.

731
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,378
What the hell do you people
intend to accomplish here?

732
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,130
We want
the shape-shifter.

733
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,756
And what do you think

734
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,591
you're going to do to him
<i>if</i> you get to him?

735
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,677
He deserves to die.
'Bout time!

736
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:49,137
He's right!

737
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:50,930
(<i> shouting dies away</i> )

738
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,599
How do you get a rope
around the neck
of a shape-shifter?

739
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,810
(<i> laughing</i> )
SISKO:
Listen to me.

740
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,396
You will disperse immediately.

741
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:01,566
Return to your quarters.
Return to your ships.

742
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,068
(<i> yelling resumes</i> )

743
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,574
(<i> whooshing</i> )

744
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:15,830
He's a murderer.

745
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,707
We want justice.

746
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:19,251
Do you?

747
00:40:19,251 --> 00:40:22,295
Justice. Really?

748
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:24,297
Is it justice you're after

749
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:28,218
or just some way to express
your anger, your fear?

750
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:29,844
Look at yourselves.

751
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:33,390
In an hour, you'll regret
what you tried to do here.

752
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:36,935
Do not condemn this man
because he is different
than you are.

753
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:40,230
We condemn him because
of the evidence.

754
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,981
CROWD:
Yeah!

755
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:44,650
Then take that evidence
to a court of law.

756
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,819
There will be no justice
served here today.

757
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,196
BASHIR:
Commander!

758
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:50,323
Commander Sisko,
I believe we have

759
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:52,117
some new evidence
to consider.

760
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:54,202
The man who was murdered
was not Ibudan.

761
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:55,620
What?!

762
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,414
Come with me.

763
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:04,087
All right, break it up now.

764
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:05,838
Move on, people.
Let's clear the area.

765
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,382
You heard what she said.
Let's go.

766
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:08,674
Come on.
Back to your quarters.

767
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:09,926
Quickly. Move!

768
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:12,053
A clone.

769
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:13,972
That's what Ibudan
was working on.

770
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:16,057
Creating a clone
of himself.

771
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:17,892
And then he killed
the clone

772
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:20,228
to frame me
for his murder.

773
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:23,273
How can we be sure
the victim was a clone?

774
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:25,900
A clone has identical DNA
to that of the donor,

775
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,693
but certain cloning
methods cause

776
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:31,114
a characteristic
gene-sequence degradation

777
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:32,949
which<i> can</i> be detected.

778
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:34,700
If you know to look for it.

779
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,161
We've matched
the victim's gene sequence

780
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:38,121
with the fellow
in the jar here.

781
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:39,872
They're definitely
both clones.

782
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:41,291
And what happens
to this one?

783
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:42,583
In about two days

784
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,419
he becomes a living,
breathing member

785
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:46,338
of Bajoran society.

786
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:49,257
ODO:
Let's hope he doesn't follow
in his donor's footsteps.

787
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:51,050
What about Ibudan?

788
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:56,139
I have an idea
where to find him.

789
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:05,273
Computer, lights.

790
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:18,328
Who are you?
How did you get in here?

791
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:20,163
Oh, I think you know.

792
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:23,458
I warn you,
I'll call Ship Security.

793
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:24,959
Do that.

794
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:27,379
I have some interesting
questions to ask them.

795
00:42:27,379 --> 00:42:29,297
For example, I'm especially
curious to know

796
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:31,007
how the name Lamonay S.

797
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:34,427
came to appear on this ship's
passenger list yesterday.

798
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:36,054
That is my name

799
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:37,889
and I arranged transport
on this vessel.

800
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:40,016
Why should that
be so strange?

801
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:43,144
You did not arrive
on this ship.

802
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:45,146
No.

803
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:48,191
Well, just what ship did you
arrive on, Mr. Lamonay S.?

804
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,276
I can't find any record
of your arrival

805
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,945
on any vessel that has docked
here in the last three weeks.

806
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:57,450
I assure you,
you are in error.

807
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:00,036
In fact, I think you
did arrive on this ship

808
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:01,913
and that you spent
the last few years

809
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:03,622
in a prison among
Bajoran dissidents,

810
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:05,708
one of whom, I've learned,
was a scientist

811
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:07,377
who was arrested
by the Cardassians

812
00:43:07,377 --> 00:43:09,254
for conducting
experimental research

813
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:10,338
into tri-phasic cloning.

814
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:21,224
Killing your own clone
is still murder.

815
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:26,145
<i>Commander's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46421.5.</i>

816
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:28,481
<i>Ibudan has been turned over</i>
<i>to the Bajoran authorities</i>

817
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:30,525
<i>just hours after his clone</i>
<i>gained consciousness</i>

818
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:32,318
<i>and began a new life.</i>

819
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,195
<i>The perpetrators</i>
<i>of the mob violence</i>

820
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:36,155
<i>have retreated</i>
<i>into their own business.</i>

821
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:39,492
<i>To my knowledge,</i>
<i>Odo has received no apologies.</i>

822
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:42,703
<i>Meanwhile, life on the station</i>
<i>has begun to return to normal.</i>

823
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,581
Computer, what time is it?

824
00:43:44,581 --> 00:43:47,083
0907 hours.

825
00:43:49,419 --> 00:43:50,753
I guess you were right.

826
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,505
It isn't going to be easy.

827
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:54,466
Maybe it's just going
to take a little time...

828
00:43:54,466 --> 00:43:57,594
Sit down!

829
00:43:57,594 --> 00:43:59,596
Not next
to that human boy.

830
00:43:59,596 --> 00:44:02,890
I don't want you to have
anything to do with him.

831
00:44:05,477 --> 00:44:09,105
We'll... try it
for a few weeks.

832
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:18,615
Please come in.

833
00:44:18,615 --> 00:44:20,992
Uh, take any seat.

834
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:22,868
Try to be on time
from now on.

835
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:24,579
My name is
Keiko O'Brien.

836
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:26,498
I'll be your teacher.

837
00:44:26,498 --> 00:44:28,625
Why don't we turn
on our computers

838
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:31,877
and access the files on Bajor
to find out a little bit more

839
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:34,506
about the people and
history of this world...
