00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:05,255
SISKO:
<i>Station Log, Stardate 48543.2.</i>

2
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:06,924
<i>A team of Cardassian scientists</i>

3
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:09,050
<i>is coming to the station</i>
<i>to assist us</i>

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,762
<i>in deploying a subspace relay</i>
<i>in the Gamma Quadrant.</i>

5
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:14,139
<i>If successful,</i>
<i>it will allow communication</i>

6
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:17,559
<i>through the wormhole</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

7
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,478
I've assigned
these quarters

8
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:22,815
to the senior Cardassian
scientist, her name is Ulani.

9
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:25,275
Her colleague, Gilora,
has the adjacent room.

10
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,443
It's warm in here.

11
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:27,820
I take it you reset

12
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,279
the environmental
controls.

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,906
I also had Chief
O'Brien reprogram

14
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:33,158
the replicators to provide
Cardassian food.

15
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:34,451
Security measures?

16
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,077
I've assigned
two of my people

17
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,830
to follow the Cardassians
at all times.

18
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,665
Fine, have them
keep their distance.

19
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:41,082
I want the Cardassians

20
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,710
to feel like guests,
not prisoners.

21
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,838
Commander, there are
still elements opposed

22
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:48,549
to the peace treaty
between Cardassia and Bajor

23
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:49,925
on both sides.

24
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:51,760
We have to be prepared
for trouble.

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,387
I realize that, but while
the Cardassians are here

26
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,305
I want the Bajorans

27
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,140
to get used to seeing them
walking on the Promenade...

28
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,559
buying from their shops,

29
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,143
eating from their
restaurants...

30
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,812
getting to know them
as something other

31
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,939
than brutal overseers.

32
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,816
(<i> door opens</i> )

33
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:08,527
I just received the final update
from the Cardassians

34
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:11,154
on the transceiver they designed
for the communications relay.

35
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,740
How does it look?

36
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,035
I'm still not convinced
it's going to work.

37
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:17,912
The Cardassians seem
sure that it will.

38
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:19,705
I hope
they're right.

39
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:25,920
Whose quarters
are these--

40
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,589
Gilora's or Ulani's?

41
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,049
Ulani's.

42
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:31,967
And how do you know
their names?

43
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:34,261
I was just informed
an hour ago.

44
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:37,556
Odo, please...

45
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:41,100
I have a bottle of<i> kanar</i>
<i>for each of them...</i>

46
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,397
along with a personal
invitation to Quark's.

47
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:47,733
Where did you get real<i> kanar?</i>

48
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:49,526
I've had three cases
in my storeroom

49
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,445
since the occupation.

50
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:54,114
There hasn't been much call
for it the past few years...

51
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,076
but that's about to change.

52
00:01:57,076 --> 00:01:59,536
There are only two Cardassians
coming to the station.

53
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,579
How much<i> kanar</i> do you think

54
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:02,372
they can drink?

55
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,750
There may only be two for now,
but there'll be more

56
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,418
thanks to the peace treaty.

57
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:08,921
And as the 34th Rule
of Acquisition states

58
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:10,672
"Peace is good for business."

59
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,925
That's the 35th Rule.

60
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:15,052
Oh, you're right.
What's the 34th?

61
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,345
"War is good for business."

62
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,764
It's easy to get them confused.

63
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,891
The way I see it,
it won't be long

64
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,684
before there's
a permanent

65
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,686
Cardassian presence
on the station...

66
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:27,397
scientists,
diplomats...

67
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,983
spies.

68
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:31,568
And they'll<i> all</i>
<i>be welcome at Quark's.</i>

69
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,946
As long as they can pay.

70
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:36,991
Rumor has it that the
shop next door to mine

71
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:38,909
is going out of business.

72
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:42,370
I'm thinking of renting it
and setting up

73
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,414
a few Cardassian
gaming concessions.

74
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:48,335
There'll be no live vole fights
on the Promenade, Quark.

75
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:49,837
I would never
be party

76
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:52,840
to anything so cruel
and inhumane.

77
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,968
But, of course,
if some Cardassians

78
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:59,220
happen to bring
their voles along

79
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,473
and they<i> happened</i>
<i>to get into a fight</i>

80
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:03,433
I could hardly be
held responsible for...

81
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,102
Oh, yes, you could.

82
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:07,646
And you will be.

83
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,899
Fine.

84
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,610
Forget the vole fights.

85
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,070
But I'll
tell you this.

86
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,613
Good<i> kanar</i>
<i>is hard to find.</i>

87
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,197
And I have
three cases of it.

88
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:21,493
But that's just
the beginning.

89
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:24,412
Soon, Quark's will become
known as the best place

90
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,957
for Cardassian food and drink
in this sector.

91
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:29,417
I'll probably set up
daily shipments from Cardassia.

92
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:30,919
I may even

93
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,672
need to buy my own
transport ship.

94
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:36,133
Quark, this<i> kanar</i>

95
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,425
has gone bad.

96
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,844
What?!

97
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,595
I suggest you take
your bottles

98
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:41,930
and leave, Quark

99
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,557
before I have
you arrested

100
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,934
for attempting
to poison our guests.

101
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,991
Excuse me, Commander.

102
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,035
There's a Vedek Yarka
here to see you.

103
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:04,953
He says
it's urgent.

104
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,666
Thank you for seeing me,
Emissary.

105
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,543
What can I do for you?

106
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:13,461
I am here with a warning
from the Prophets.

107
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,172
They don't want you
to let the Cardassians

108
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,840
come aboard this station.

109
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,343
If you do, you will bring
destruction on us all.

110
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,972
(<i> sighs</i> )

111
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,554
Are you making some
sort of threat, Vedek?

112
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,056
Not at all.

113
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:30,724
I'm simply telling you
what was foretold

114
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,184
in the ancient texts.

115
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:33,518
Ancient texts...
you mean a prophecy?

116
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,187
Trakor's Third.

117
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:37,856
When he first encountered
the Orb of Change.

118
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,398
I'm afraid I
don't know it.

119
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:41,735
Perhaps you should
make more time

120
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,111
to study the
texts, child.

121
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,612
Are you saying
that the arrival

122
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,156
of the Cardassian scientists

123
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,824
was foretold
in a Bajoran prophecy?

124
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:48,950
Exactly.

125
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,827
Trakor's words are clear.

126
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:54,748
"When the river wakes, stirred
once more to Janir's side

127
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:58,417
three vipers will return
to their nest in the sky."

128
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:00,879
The river has
awoken, Emissary.

129
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,298
The Qui'al Dam was just
put back into operation

130
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,092
to divert water
to the city.

131
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:07,302
Just as Trakor prophesied
over 3,000 years ago.

132
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,596
And even now, the vipers
are making their way here.

133
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,139
And I take it

134
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,682
you think the vipers
are a reference

135
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,434
to the Cardassian scientists?

136
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,687
Yes, and this station
is their nest in the sky.

137
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,735
And how exactly
is their presence here

138
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:26,238
going to bring destruction
on us all?

139
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:28,031
Trakor said

140
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,909
"When the vipers try to peer
through the temple gates

141
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,453
"a sword of stars
will appear in the heavens.

142
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,790
The temple will burn, and
the gates will be cast open."

143
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,209
You must not let
the Cardassians come here.

144
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:42,170
You must not let them
violate the Celestial Temple

145
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,964
or they will destroy it

146
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,425
and Bajor will be cut off
from the Prophets forever.

147
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:49,261
Slow down.
Now, let me get this straight.

148
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:52,889
You're saying that the vipers--
the Cardassians--

149
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:53,974
are going to destroy
the wormhole?

150
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,600
Don't you see?

151
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,019
This communications relay
you hope to create

152
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,896
is part of the prophecy.

153
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:03,650
It will allow the vipers to peer
through the temple gates--

154
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,526
the wormhole, as you call it.

155
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:08,363
And if they do, the temple
will be destroyed.

156
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:11,783
Even if we accept that the
Cardassians are the vipers

157
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:14,661
there are only two of
them coming, not three.

158
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,079
Isn't it possible

159
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,831
that there are
other mistakes

160
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,707
in your interpretation
of the prophecy as well?

161
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,543
There<i> will</i> be three vipers,
you will see.

162
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,504
SISKO:
Do you understand what
this communications relay

163
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,131
could mean for Bajor?

164
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,342
If it works,
we'll be able to stay in contact

165
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,135
with ships
in the Gamma Quadrant.

166
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,971
It'll facilitate exploration

167
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:35,015
help us monitor
Dominion activity

168
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,142
give us warning
in case of an attack.

169
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:40,228
<i>None</i> of that matters.

170
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,855
You must listen to me.

171
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,024
I know it is difficult
for you to accept

172
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,775
because you are not Bajoran.

173
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,153
I have studied the prophecies
all my life.

174
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,780
We are on the verge
of a great disaster.

175
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,492
Is the Bajoran Assembly
aware of this prophecy?

176
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:54,993
Yes...

177
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,453
as is the Kai herself.

178
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,288
Yet, they still want us
to proceed

179
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,581
with the establishment
of a communications relay.

180
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,709
They have chosen
to ignore the signs.

181
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,919
And that is why I came
to you, Emissary

182
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,546
because I have faith in you.

183
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,257
I know that you will do
what must be done.

184
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,426
Vedek...

185
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:14,179
I have the utmost respect
for your beliefs

186
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:17,807
but I have no intention
of calling this project off.

187
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:24,689
I hope that you will
reconsider, Emissary.

188
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,275
My followers and I
will remain on the station

189
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,069
and pray that you
change your mind.

190
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,196
You are free to do that,
of course.

191
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:41,456
Major, have Odo find out
everything he can

192
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,958
about Vedek Yarka
and his followers.

193
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,044
I don't want them
making any trouble

194
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,296
while the Cardassians
are here.

195
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,433
(<i> sighs</i> )

196
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,319
I'm Commander Benjamin Sisko

197
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:14,239
and, on behalf of the
United Federation of Planets

198
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,698
and Starfleet Command

199
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,618
I'd like to welcome you
to Deep Space 9.

200
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,203
Thank you, Commander.

201
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,621
I'm Dr. Ulani Belor.

202
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,914
Gilora Rejal.

203
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,999
The Cardassian
government

204
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,918
wishes to express
its gratitude

205
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:28,878
to the Federation
for agreeing

206
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,880
to work together
on this project.

207
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,758
It is our hope that it is the
first of many such projects

208
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,260
between
our peoples.

209
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,762
That's a hope I can
assure you we share.

210
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,474
This is my First
Officer, Major Kira.

211
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,601
And on behalf of the Bajoran
provisional government

212
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:44,018
I'd like to welcome you.

213
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,686
It is our belief
that this project

214
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,730
will mark the beginning
of a new era of peace

215
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,816
for Bajor
and Cardassia.

216
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,485
Thank you, Major.

217
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,488
Well...

218
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:57,449
now that we've gotten the
formalities out of the way

219
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:58,533
how was your trip?

220
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:01,328
Exhausting.

221
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,954
We spent most of it
rehearsing

222
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:05,081
what we were going to say
when we got here.

223
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,874
We're scientists,
not diplomats.

224
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,751
You did very well.

225
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,796
Please feel free to let
the Central Command know that.

226
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,590
In the past few days

227
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,926
I've been contacted by Guls
I haven't even heard of

228
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:20,972
all of them wanting to emphasize
how important this mission is.

229
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,265
I know what you mean.

230
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:23,891
I've gotten three calls

231
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,602
from Starfleet Command
just this morning.

232
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,521
(<i> laughs</i> )

233
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:29,564
Major Kira

234
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:32,317
I want to thank you personally
for allowing us to come here.

235
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,318
Me?

236
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,735
You're the ranking

237
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,029
Bajoran officer
on this station.

238
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,780
I'm sure we wouldn't be here

239
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,033
if you had been opposed
to working with us.

240
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,995
I'll work with anyone
who's interested in peace.

241
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:47,040
I'm glad we already
have so much in common.

242
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,753
Well, why don't I show you
to your quarters?

243
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,596
The signaling platform
we've designed

244
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,056
is intended to be positioned

245
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,849
in the Gamma Quadrant,
at this point--

246
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,851
two kilometers from the
far mouth of the wormhole.

247
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:10,480
Our transceiver is being
configured to fit inside it

248
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,856
and use its
existing power grid.

249
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,400
GILORA:
A similar transceiver

250
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,361
will be put in place
here on Terok Nor--

251
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:19,738
on Deep Space 9.

252
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:22,409
Ulani, I've looked over
your design specifications.

253
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,785
I'm not clear on what
sort of carrier wave

254
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,120
you're planning on using

255
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,455
to cut through
the interference

256
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,332
on the inside
of the wormhole.

257
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:32,627
We're planning to test various
types of soliton pulses.

258
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,045
One of them
should maintain

259
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,089
the required
signal integrity.

260
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,425
We tried something similar about
a year ago without much success.

261
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,884
Yes, the Bajoran
government

262
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,886
made your data
available to us.

263
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,804
I believe the problem
had to do with

264
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:46,015
the phase variance
in your transceiver coils.

265
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,727
Well, I configured
those coils myself.

266
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:51,812
The variance was less
than .01 percent.

267
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:55,066
Which, as you saw,
was unacceptably high.

268
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,277
Our new design has less
than half that variance.

269
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,112
You don't mind
if I look at the specs?

270
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,115
<i>If</i> you think
it's necessary.

271
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,575
Commander...

272
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,326
we'll need to make
a few adjustments

273
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,953
to the station's
signaling array

274
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,371
so that it
can accommodate

275
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,581
the type of
transmissions

276
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,249
we're planning
to use.

277
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,543
Chief O'Brien's people
can assist you with that.

278
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:15,295
And when you're ready

279
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:18,131
we'll take the<i> Defiant</i>
<i>to the Gamma Quadrant</i>

280
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,675
deploy the communications relay
and start running tests.

281
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,343
Excellent.

282
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:25,846
Well, it's been
a long day.

283
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,600
We'd like to get some rest
so we can start fresh tomorrow.

284
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,976
I'll have someone

285
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,561
show you to
your quarters.

286
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:33,104
Thank you, but that
won't be necessary.

287
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:34,314
Thank you.

288
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,154
Now, those are about

289
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,948
the two friendliest vipers
I have ever met.

290
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,660
I'll explain later.

291
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,869
(<i> door opens</i> )

292
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,164
Commander, I almost
forgot to tell you.

293
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,957
Another colleague
of ours, Dejar

294
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,833
will be arriving later today.

295
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,960
I'll arrange quarters.

296
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,836
Thank you.

297
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,548
So...

298
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,800
we need to discuss

299
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,718
what we're going
to do about...

300
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,722
What is it, Major?

301
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:10,183
There are going to be
three of them.

302
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,976
Yes?

303
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:15,854
Three vipers...

304
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:18,483
just like
in the prophecy.

305
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:31,538
ODO:
It turns out that Vedek Yarka
is no longer a Vedek at all.

306
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,790
He was stripped of his
title two months ago.

307
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,999
Why?

308
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,917
Officially, for teachings

309
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,546
not in keeping with
the Bajoran faith.

310
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:43,633
But according to my sources,
he was defrocked because he led

311
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:46,969
a series of protests
against the Vedek Assembly

312
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,430
when they endorsed the peace
treaty with Cardassia.

313
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,850
So Yarka may be
using this prophecy

314
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,143
as a way to scuttle
the peace treaty.

315
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,312
That would seem
to be his agenda.

316
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:59,566
And it's probably coloring
his view of the prophecy

317
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:02,276
just as your agenda
colors how you see it.

318
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,529
I don't have an agenda, Odo.

319
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,906
I want this project to succeed

320
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,949
because I want
the peace treaty to succeed.

321
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:12,579
If I thought for a moment
that there was any possibility

322
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,205
that this communications relay

323
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:16,082
could cause damage
to the wormhole

324
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,917
I'd put a stop to it right now.

325
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:21,462
That's not the agenda
I was referring to, Commander.

326
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,463
Oh?

327
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,964
I was referring

328
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,050
to your desire
to distance yourself

329
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,927
from the title of Emissary.

330
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,764
It's just an observation,
of course

331
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,640
but it's always seemed to me

332
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,976
that you've never been
comfortable with it.

333
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,107
(<i> sighs</i> )

334
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,943
I can't deny that.

335
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,239
Are you suggesting

336
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,950
that I'm dismissing
this prophecy too easily

337
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,245
because I don't want
to be the Emissary?

338
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:56,330
I'm not suggesting
anything

339
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,583
but it's been my experience

340
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:02,462
that all humanoids have
an agenda of some sort

341
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,505
and that their agendas
can influence them

342
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,966
without their even realizing it.

343
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,596
Morn came by the Infirmary
this afternoon.

344
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,640
He had an acute case
of food poisoning.

345
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,934
Morn? I didn't think anything
could make him sick.

346
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:17,518
Well, he said he had

347
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,186
a bad glass of
<i>kanar</i> at Quark's.

348
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,772
He should ask
for a refund.

349
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:22,356
Apparently, it was
on the house.

350
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,901
Major, may I have
a word with you?

351
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,360
I'll see
you later.

352
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,863
What can I do
for you, Vedek?

353
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:31,031
Have you been able to
convince the Emissary

354
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,075
to reconsider
his decision?

355
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,119
I haven't tried
and I'm not planning to.

356
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,913
But you must.

357
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,832
If not, the Celestial
Temple will be destroyed.

358
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,792
I'm not convinced
that's going to happen.

359
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,168
Don't you believe
in the prophecies?

360
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,252
Yes.

361
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,754
And don't you believe

362
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,464
that Commander Sisko
is the Emissary?

363
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:49,133
Vedek, you have to understand
my position here.

364
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:52,136
Commander Sisko is
my superior officer.

365
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,305
I have to deal with him
on that basis first.

366
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:56,390
So you do believe
he is the Emissary.

367
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,392
You just don't want
him to know that.

368
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,227
I understand.

369
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,688
You want him to know

370
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:02,814
that he can count
on you as an officer

371
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:04,649
under his command.

372
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:07,109
You want to keep your work
and your faith separate.

373
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,903
Yes, and for three
years now, I have.

374
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:11,155
I'm afraid
that's no longer possible.

375
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,782
The Prophets have chosen you

376
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,075
to help the Emissary
make this decision.

377
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:18,538
A decision that has profound
implications for all of Bajor.

378
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:21,123
You must convince him
to make the Cardassians leave

379
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,501
before the sword of stars
appears.

380
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,962
Vedek, if you're asking me to...

381
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:28,798
It is not I who is asking,
it is the Prophets.

382
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,842
If you turn your back
on them now

383
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:32,635
you're abandoning your faith.

384
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,428
And without your faith, Nerys

385
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,973
what do you have left?

386
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,191
I prefer
the serialist poets

387
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:50,319
from the First Republic,
like Iloja of Prim.

388
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,197
He's easily my favorite
Cardassian writer.

389
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,533
It is so rare to meet
a non-Cardassian

390
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,284
who appreciates
our literature.

391
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,912
I took an interest

392
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,205
because I had the
chance to meet Iloja.

393
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,498
You<i> knew</i> him?

394
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,458
One of my
previous hosts

395
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,045
Tobin, met him while he
was in exile on Vulcan.

396
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:11,215
As I recall, he had
quite a temper.
Really?

397
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:14,761
QUARK:
I believe this is the
party you're looking for.

398
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,136
ULANI:
Dejar.

399
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,598
May I introduce
Jadzia Dax

400
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,641
and Miles
O'Brien.

401
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,602
Our colleague,
Dejar.

402
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,562
We weren't expecting
you so soon.

403
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:27,231
I was able to arrange
special transportation.

404
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,983
I'm sure you were.

405
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,862
I took the liberty
of preparing

406
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:35,573
a few of our special
Cardassian delicacies.

407
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:43,081
Tojal in
<i>yamok</i> sauce.

408
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:44,331
Regova eggs.

409
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:47,126
All fresh,
not replicated.

410
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:52,465
Well, enjoy.

411
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,971
Is something wrong?

412
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,764
It's just...

413
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:03,059
I don't really care
for Cardassian cuisine.

414
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,310
GILORA:
We try to avoid it

415
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,270
whenever possible.

416
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,106
(<i> chuckling</i> )

417
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:10,566
Fortunately, those of us
in the Science Ministry

418
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,193
are provided with a wide variety
of off-world food.

419
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,237
Yes, we're
actually quite spoiled.

420
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,657
Some of us even think
of ourselves

421
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:20,326
as better
than the average Cardassian.

422
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,544
The main switching
relays are in here.

423
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:33,297
I think we should hook
your transceiver

424
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,799
to the ODN interface
through the...

425
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,968
What happened to
these couplings?

426
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:39,929
What? Oh, I-I made
some modifications.

427
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,973
Well, these relays
don't have nearly

428
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:44,058
as much carrying
capacity as before.

429
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:45,643
They won't be able to handle

430
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,311
the signal load
from the transceiver.

431
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,271
Well, in order
to bring the system

432
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:52,191
up to Starfleet code, I had
to take out the couplings

433
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,527
to make room
for a secondary backup.

434
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,864
Starfleet code requires
a<i> second</i> backup?

435
00:19:57,864 --> 00:20:01,492
In case the first one fails.

436
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,452
What are the chances that
both a primary system

437
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,205
<i>and</i> its backup would
fail at the same time?

438
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,290
Well, it's very unlikely,
but, in a crunch

439
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,544
I wouldn't like to be caught
without a second backup.

440
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,922
Well!

441
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:15,965
(<i> pounds fist</i> )

442
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,633
What's done is done.

443
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,260
I'll try to figure out
what we should do next.

444
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,346
Well, I think our best
bet would be to go...

445
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:25,391
Please, please just
give me a moment to think.

446
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,476
Fine.

447
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,520
I'll just sit
here quietly.

448
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,314
Huh. In that case,
could you get me

449
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,983
a cup of red leaf tea?

450
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,363
Why not?

451
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,295
We've loaded
the communications relay

452
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,463
into the<i> Defiant's</i> cargo bay.

453
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,049
Good.

454
00:20:58,049 --> 00:20:59,508
How are Chief O'Brien
and Gilora coming along?

455
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,301
They've run into
some kind of problem

456
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,803
but the Chief says
the transceiver

457
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,430
should be on line
in about four hours.

458
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,348
We won't be ready much
before that anyway.

459
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,684
DAX:
We've received clearance
from Ops, Commander.

460
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:11,062
Release docking clamps

461
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:13,355
and set a course
for the wormhole.

462
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,243
Full scan.

463
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:27,161
No sign of Dominion activity.

464
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:28,871
No other ships in the area.

465
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,457
SISKO:
All right, take
us into position.

466
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,751
Stand by to deploy the relay...

467
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:34,752
Wait a minute.

468
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:36,420
What is it?

469
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,548
I'm reading a large mass
of ice and ionized gas

470
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,883
entering
sensor range

471
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,426
bearing 215 mark 3.

472
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,303
It looks like a rogue comet.

473
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,805
Let's have a look.

474
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,431
Put it on screen.

475
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:52,770
It's beautiful.

476
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,563
DAX:
Its core contains

477
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,440
unusually high concentrations
of silithium.

478
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,691
That's why its tail

479
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:58,776
is so bright.

480
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:01,320
The sword of stars.

481
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,498
That's a very
colorful way

482
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:15,375
to describe
a comet, Major.

483
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,673
It's just a figure of speech.

484
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,846
Well, your sword of stars

485
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,597
is going to pass
very near the wormhole

486
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,349
but not close enough
to interfere with our plans.

487
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:33,269
We're in position, Benjamin.

488
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:35,938
Begin a final systems check
on the relay station.

489
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:38,149
I want to deploy it
within the hour.

490
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:50,703
Major, can I have
a word with you?

491
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:02,464
The sword of stars?

492
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:05,051
It certainly looked
like that to me.

493
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,760
That's open to debate

494
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,013
but what is not debatable
is that this prophecy

495
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:11,140
has no place
on the Bridge of the<i> Defiant</i>

496
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,142
especially in front
of the Cardassians.

497
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:15,435
At the moment, they are
not even aware of it

498
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:16,896
and I want
to keep it that way.

499
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:19,315
You're right.

500
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:20,900
It won't happen again.

501
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,069
Well...

502
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,367
I take it, Major

503
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:33,453
that you believe
the prophecy is coming true.

504
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:35,831
Yes, I do.

505
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,792
So you think I should
call this mission off?

506
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,128
Look at what's
happened already.

507
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:44,215
The river has returned to Janir,
the three vipers

508
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:45,841
now the sword of stars--

509
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,635
each of them predicted
by Trakor's prophecy.

510
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,848
And then
there's you...

511
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:55,309
the Emissary.

512
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:58,687
You're here.

513
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:02,400
You have a decision to make,
just like in the prophecy.

514
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,653
Do you really believe
that I'm the Emissary?

515
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,659
I guess I always have.

516
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:19,208
I... never wanted
to admit it to myself.

517
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:23,461
It's hard to work for someone
who's a religious icon.

518
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:28,466
(<i> sighs</i> )

519
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:34,556
I hope I don't offend
your beliefs

520
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:39,853
but I don't see myself as an
icon, religious or otherwise.

521
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:43,899
I'm a Starfleet officer, and
I have a mission to accomplish.

522
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:47,569
If I call it off, it has to be
for some concrete reason

523
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:52,490
something solid,
something Starfleet.

524
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,534
All right,
how about this?

525
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:56,703
The Prophets...

526
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,998
the aliens who live
in the wormhole

527
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,416
as you call them

528
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,126
exist outside
of linear time.

529
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:03,877
They know the past,
present and future.

530
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,379
Agreed.

531
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:06,839
It seems perfectly
reasonable

532
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,382
that they could've
communicated

533
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:09,883
their knowledge
of the future

534
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,885
to a Bajoran
named Trakor.

535
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,387
He wrote down
that knowledge

536
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:14,847
in the form
of a prophecy

537
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,974
and now, 3,000
years later

538
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:19,810
we are seeing
those events unfold.

539
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:22,938
To me, that reasoning
sounds concrete, solid.

540
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,024
I'd even call it
"Starfleet."

541
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,193
(<i> chuckles</i> )

542
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,364
But that all hinges
on how you interpret

543
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:33,740
an ancient text
that's been translated

544
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,994
and retranslated
over the centuries.

545
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:39,872
Words that were couched
in metaphor to begin with.

546
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:42,582
I'm sorry, Major

547
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:44,751
but where you see
a sword of stars

548
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:46,462
I see a comet.

549
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:51,842
Where you see vipers,
I see three scientists.

550
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:54,636
And where you see the Emissary

551
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:58,265
I see a Starfleet officer.

552
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,184
Dax to Sisko.

553
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:01,601
Go ahead.

554
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:04,271
We're ready to deploy the relay.

555
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:09,902
On my way.

556
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:18,244
(<i> sighs</i> )

557
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,213
All right.

558
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:30,881
Now we just have
to shunt the ODN line

559
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:32,466
through the secondary
field coils.

560
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:33,717
We can't do that.

561
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,219
Why not?

562
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:37,721
Because those coils
aren't configured

563
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,473
to handle ODN output.

564
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:40,640
Why not?

565
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,142
Did you modify them, too?

566
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,769
Actually,
I replaced them.

567
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:46,021
They were always
shorting out on us.

568
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,357
Frankly, I don't
see how this station

569
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:50,692
kept running during
the occupation.

570
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,194
Why didn't you tell me

571
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:54,405
you'd replaced
the secondary field coils?

572
00:26:54,405 --> 00:26:56,073
If you had told me

573
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:58,742
what you were planning
to do, I would have.

574
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:01,370
I don't have time
to explain everything.

575
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:04,664
What? You think I won't
be able to understand?

576
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:07,084
It<i> has</i> been
my experience that it...

577
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:09,253
What?

578
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:12,131
That humans aren't
good engineers?

579
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:16,718
No, not humans-- males.

580
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,596
I beg your pardon?

581
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:21,223
Men just don't seem to have
a head for this sort of thing.

582
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:23,559
That's why women
dominate the sciences.

583
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:26,812
Maybe on Cardassia,
but on this station

584
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:28,688
this<i> man</i> is
Chief of Operations

585
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:31,108
and I know more
about these systems

586
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:33,068
than anyone,
including you.

587
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,571
I think I know
what the problem is

588
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:39,032
so if you want to get
that transceiver on line

589
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:43,036
hand me the laser-torch
and give me some room.

590
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,338
(<i> sighs</i> )

591
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:04,642
Are we ready on this end?

592
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:06,185
Almost. I'm just
about to activate

593
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,145
the relay's
transmission array.

594
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:09,188
Dejar?

595
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:12,399
Standing by.

596
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,153
I am receiving
the relay's test signal.

597
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:17,863
Target the signaling array
toward the wormhole

598
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,156
and initiate
a carrier wave

599
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:20,533
in the delta
band frequency.

600
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:22,159
Initiating carrier wave.

601
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,994
If they receive it
on the station

602
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:25,663
they'll send
an acknowledging signal

603
00:28:25,663 --> 00:28:27,914
in the same frequency.

604
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:34,254
I'm not receiving anything.

605
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:37,007
Then we have to assume
it didn't work.

606
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:39,510
Let's try
the theta band frequency.

607
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,137
Initiating carrier wave.

608
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:47,393
Something's wrong.

609
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:49,645
I'm picking up a neutrino surge
from the wormhole.

610
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,652
Report!

611
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:58,945
Somehow the carrier wave
caused the wormhole to open.

612
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:01,948
The wormhole's gravity well has
increased by a factor of three.

613
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:04,784
Terminate the carrier wave
and maintain our position.

614
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,334
Gravimetric fields
have returned

615
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:13,335
to normal.

616
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:14,294
What happened?

617
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,338
I'm not sure.

618
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:18,006
The carrier wave shouldn't have
affected the wormhole at all.

619
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,717
Was there any damage
to the relay?

620
00:29:19,717 --> 00:29:21,843
None. I'm still receiving
the test signal.

621
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,470
Benjamin,
the gravitational surge

622
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,055
altered the course of the comet.

623
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:27,140
It's now heading directly
toward the wormhole.

624
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,101
If the comet enters the wormhole

625
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,852
the silithium in its core

626
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,646
will cause
a cascade reaction.

627
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:34,814
And collapse the wormhole
permanently.

628
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:45,367
<i>Commander's Log, supplemental.</i>

629
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,077
<i>With less than five hours</i>

630
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:48,954
<i>before the comet</i>
<i>reaches the wormhole</i>

631
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,997
<i>I've brought the Defiant</i>
<i>back to the station</i>

632
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:53,250
<i>and convened a meeting</i>
<i>of the entire science team.</i>

633
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,502
DAX:
Apparently,
the carrier wave we sent

634
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,921
created some sort of
subspace inversion

635
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,548
inside the wormhole.

636
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:00,840
That's what caused
the gravity well to form.

637
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,509
ULANI:
The possibility

638
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,762
of subspace inversion
was predicted in one

639
00:30:04,762 --> 00:30:06,054
of our computer
models.

640
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,389
Well, that wasn't
included

641
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:08,890
in the data
you sent us.

642
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,726
The probability
of such an occurrence

643
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,145
was less than two percent--
well within safety limits.

644
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:16,231
We saw no reason to include it
in the data we sent you.

645
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,275
It would seem that our
scientific methodologies

646
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:20,026
differ slightly.

647
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:22,154
It is our practice to examine
all possibilities

648
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:24,698
no matter how unlikely, before
we proceed with field tests.

649
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:26,241
We would, of course

650
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,452
prefer to operate
that way, as well.

651
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,621
However, since
the Science Ministry

652
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:33,248
falls under the jurisdiction
of the military

653
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,041
we have to follow
certain rules.

654
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,002
One of them is not
to make any project

655
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,211
look unnecessarily
dangerous.

656
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,005
We'll keep that in mind

657
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:42,215
when we resume work
on the communications relay.

658
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,550
DEJAR:
That is an extremely

659
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,926
unlikely possibility, Commander.

660
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,637
The Science Ministry

661
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:49,097
will undoubtedly wish
to assemble a new team

662
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,767
before proceeding
further.

663
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:53,686
SISKO:
That is,
of course

664
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:56,229
an internal Cardassian matter.

665
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,815
Chief...

666
00:30:57,815 --> 00:30:59,650
Dax feels
we can't risk

667
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,110
using tractor beams
to deflect the comet.

668
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,821
It would probably
break into smaller pieces

669
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:05,197
and we'd have
a bigger mess on our hands.

670
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,448
The same thing
would happen

671
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:07,574
if you tried
to destroy it

672
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:08,575
with a phaser beam.

673
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,327
Not necessarily.

674
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:12,204
I could modify the
<i>Defiant's</i> phaser array

675
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,872
to generate a beam
wide enough

676
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,666
to encompass
the entire comet.

677
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:18,168
Vaporizing it evenly,
so it won't break up.

678
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:20,170
How long would
the modifications take?

679
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,755
Three hours.

680
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:23,256
Get on it.

681
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,217
We'll be cutting this one
pretty close.

682
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,266
I've accessed
the<i> Defiant's</i>

683
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,476
primary phaser relay.

684
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:36,102
I'm going to try
shunting it

685
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,437
through the warp drive.

686
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,481
Won't that overload
the relay?

687
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:41,400
Not if we bypass
the plasma emitter.

688
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,194
I hadn't thought
of that.

689
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:48,907
(<i> stammering</i> )

690
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,744
The emitter coupling
is over there.

691
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:13,932
What are you
doing now?

692
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,559
I'm decoupling
the servos

693
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:17,394
so they don't
lock up.

694
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:29,448
You have very steady hands.

695
00:32:30,908 --> 00:32:34,202
Well they get the job done,
I guess.

696
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,622
And right now,
the most important job

697
00:32:36,622 --> 00:32:39,625
is bypassing the
plasma emitter.

698
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:50,552
I assure you,
I'm quite fertile.

699
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:53,263
I could provide you
with many healthy children

700
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:55,557
if that's your concern,
but, quite frankly

701
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:58,101
I think you're getting
a little ahead of yourself.

702
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,853
Children?

703
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:02,314
What are you talking about?

704
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,399
I already have a child

705
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,234
<i>and</i> a wife.

706
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,570
You're married?

707
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,280
Yes, happily!

708
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,158
Then why have you been
leading me to believe

709
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:14,284
that you wanted me?

710
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:16,161
I haven't.

711
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:20,248
All we've done
since we've met is argue.

712
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:24,169
I took your overt irritability
toward me as a signal

713
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:28,340
that you wished to pursue
some physical relationship.

714
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,216
Of course.

715
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:35,096
Well, that's how Cardassians,
uh, do things?

716
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,390
Oh, my.

717
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,352
I'm afraid
this is a case

718
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:44,356
of cross-cultural
misunderstanding.

719
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:45,398
I think so.

720
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:46,817
Oh.

721
00:33:46,817 --> 00:33:50,278
I'm not remotely
interested in you.

722
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:53,281
Well, that's not
what I meant.

723
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,742
Look, you are very attractive

724
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,369
and I'm flattered,
of course. but...

725
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:58,620
Please, Mr. O'Brien

726
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,580
there's no need
to continue.

727
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,124
You've made your
feelings clear.

728
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,505
Gilora, we-we have
to finish this.

729
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:13,886
I'm sure you can complete
the job on your own.

730
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,730
Chief O'Brien
said the modification

731
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,815
to the<i> Defiant's</i> phasers
would be ready

732
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:28,483
within half an hour.

733
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:31,319
Half an hour ahead
of schedule, hmm?

734
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,154
The Chief's
a born engineer.

735
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,781
He always gives himself

736
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,825
a comfortable margin
with his repair estimates.

737
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,623
Let me guess.

738
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:46,376
You're reading up
on Bajoran prophecies

739
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:47,878
concerning the Emissary.

740
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:50,005
There are hundreds of them.

741
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:52,424
Most of them are vague,
some are contradictory.

742
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:56,386
But just enough truth in
a few of them to make me wonder.

743
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:58,430
You mean some of them
have come true?

744
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,349
If you interpret them
in a certain way, yes.

745
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:04,561
So now you're wondering
if Trakor's prophecy

746
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,354
is going to come true,
as well.

747
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,732
I have to admit,
it's getting harder to ignore.

748
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:10,442
But, Benjamin,
there's every reason

749
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,945
to believe we'll be able
to destroy the comet.

750
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:14,863
I know.

751
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,907
But I'm becoming
more and more concerned

752
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:19,242
that if I don't send
the Cardassians home

753
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,078
something else will go wrong.

754
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:25,290
And the "gates of heaven
will burn and be cast open."

755
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,584
Let me ask you something.

756
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:29,377
If you never heard
Trakor's prophecy

757
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,129
what would you do?

758
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:35,968
I'd continue working
on the communications relay.

759
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:39,512
Then it seems to me
you have a choice.

760
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:43,100
You can either
make your own decisions

761
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,352
or you can let these prophecies
make them for you.

762
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,908
As soon as the<i> Defiant</i> is ready

763
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:03,036
have the Cardassians
meet us on board.

764
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:05,622
Yes, sir.

765
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,138
The comet is directly ahead.

766
00:36:21,138 --> 00:36:22,597
Distance, 200 kilometers.

767
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,390
Bring us to within
ten kilometers.

768
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:27,435
Chief, are your phaser
modifications on line?

769
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,854
O'BRIEN:
Aye, sir.

770
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:30,563
Phasers are locked on target.

771
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,654
Holding position
at ten kilometers.

772
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:39,031
SISKO:
Shields up.

773
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:41,282
Go to Red Alert.

774
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,492
Fire!

775
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:50,333
Chief, what the hell happened?

776
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,877
I don't know, sir.

777
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:53,628
The entire weapons
relay just blew.

778
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,172
All defensive
systems are down.

779
00:36:55,172 --> 00:36:56,923
Benjamin, the sensors show

780
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,591
that the modified phasers
never came on line.

781
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,468
We fired a standard burst

782
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,762
and it shattered the comet
instead of vaporizing it.

783
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,848
There's no way they should have
misfired like that.

784
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:06,474
I modified the systems myself.

785
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,351
KIRA:
Commander, the
three fragments

786
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,353
are still on course
for the wormhole.

787
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,313
How soon before
they reach the entrance?

788
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:15,358
26 minutes.

789
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:19,278
And without weapons,
we have no way of stopping them.

790
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,792
The main emitter coupling
has been depolarized.

791
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:35,503
I must have accidentally
inverted the power flow

792
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,422
when I tried to modify
the phaser array.

793
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,216
I can't believe it.

794
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:41,300
A first-year
engineering student

795
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,511
wouldn't make a
mistake like that.

796
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,680
This wasn't your
fault, Mr. O'Brien.

797
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,515
And it wasn't
an accident.

798
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,350
Gilora...

799
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,603
Dejar is a member
of the Obsidian Order.

800
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:52,938
She was assigned
to our team

801
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:53,939
for security reasons.

802
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:55,273
I believe

803
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,067
she sabotaged
this coupling.

804
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:58,651
SISKO:
The Order has always
been opposed

805
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,653
to the peace treaty
with Bajor.

806
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:03,531
They sent you here
to sabotage the relay

807
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,658
because if the
first joint venture

808
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:08,286
between Cardassia and
Bajor was a failure

809
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,205
it would probably
be the last.

810
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:12,373
This is all speculation,
Commander.

811
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,126
You have no proof.

812
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:16,962
If it was sabotage, a DNA
scan on the coupling

813
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:19,380
should reveal
who's responsible.

814
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,550
Take her to quarters
and detain her there.

815
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,305
SISKO:
Now that the comet's
been fractured

816
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,015
into smaller pieces

817
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:31,059
can we use the tractor
beams to deflect them?

818
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:32,685
They'd just
disintegrate further

819
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,062
releasing more silithium.

820
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:36,022
If we can't
stop the fragments

821
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:38,650
is there any way that we
can prevent the silithium

822
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,652
from interacting
with the wormhole?

823
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,487
Maybe if we could
contain it somehow.

824
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:43,989
ULANI:
If you could generate

825
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:45,949
a subspace field
around the fragments

826
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:48,034
that might contain
the silithium.

827
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,828
The warp drive...

828
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:52,497
it could create a subspace
bubble around the ship.

829
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:53,999
But we'd have
to maneuver the<i> Defiant</i>

830
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:55,667
between the fragments.

831
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,710
They're too close together.
There's not enough room.

832
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,505
A shuttlepod could
maneuver between them.

833
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:02,465
And its warp drive
should be able to create

834
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,259
a large enough
subspace field.

835
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:06,344
Maybe, but it could
overload the engines.

836
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,805
That's the chance
I'll have to take.

837
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:10,890
Major, you have the Bridge.

838
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:14,102
I want you to take the<i> Defiant</i>
<i>back into the Alpha Quadrant</i>

839
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:16,562
as soon as I've cleared
the shuttlebay.

840
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:17,772
Commander.

841
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:22,735
I want to go with you.

842
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:25,322
Not just because I'm
your First Officer

843
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:29,159
but because I believe I'm
here to help the Emissary.

844
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:33,955
Dax, the Bridge
is yours.

845
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:42,714
We've cleared
the shuttlebay.

846
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:45,466
Signal the<i> Defiant</i>
<i>that they can leave.</i>

847
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,802
They're heading
for the wormhole.

848
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,512
I'm going to take us in

849
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,348
behind the
comet fragments.

850
00:39:51,348 --> 00:39:54,559
It'll be easier to
maneuver into position.

851
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,369
Hold position here.

852
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:13,953
They could be in
for a rough ride.

853
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,081
Stand by transporters
in case we need

854
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:19,292
to beam them off the shuttlepod
when they clear the wormhole.

855
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:21,253
We're in position.

856
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:24,589
Activate the
subspace field.

857
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,132
Field engaged.

858
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:32,889
We'll reach the entrance
to the wormhole in...

859
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:34,807
five seconds.

860
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,910
The subspace field
is losing integrity.

861
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:56,913
Some of the silithium
is starting to leak through.

862
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:58,748
Divert power
from the engines

863
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:00,666
to the subspace field coils.

864
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,377
We'll let our
own inertia

865
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:04,087
carry us the
rest of the way.

866
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:05,380
That helped.

867
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,006
We're still losing silithium.

868
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,676
I'm picking up a neutrino surge.

869
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:12,429
Something's coming through.

870
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:21,980
(<i> sighs</i> )

871
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:24,607
(<i> sighs</i> )

872
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:25,566
Dax to Sisko.

873
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:26,859
Sisko here.

874
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,194
Are you all right, Benjamin?

875
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,612
There was some silithium leakage

876
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,281
inside the wormhole,
but we're fine.

877
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,159
I don't believe it.

878
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,119
What is it, Chief?

879
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:38,830
I'm picking up the test signal
from the communications relay.

880
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,373
SISKO:
How is that possible?

881
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:42,041
DAX:
I'm not sure.

882
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,835
We're reading
a subspace filament

883
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:45,420
leading back through
the wormhole.

884
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,630
It's acting like some kind
of carrier wave.

885
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,590
The comet fragments...

886
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,885
they must have left a silithium
trail in the wormhole.

887
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,679
It's almost like
the wormhole

888
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,722
was wedged open
just a crack...

889
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:59,976
just enough to let
subspace signals through.

890
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:02,854
The prophecy came true...

891
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:05,273
all of it.

892
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:10,945
We just misinterpreted
Trakor's words.

893
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,282
The three vipers.

894
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:17,952
He wasn't talking
about the Cardassians.

895
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:21,664
He meant the three
comet fragments.

896
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:25,960
The communications relay.

897
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,046
In a sense, we've been trying

898
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:30,548
to peer
through the temple gates.

899
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:33,885
The silithium
ignited the wormhole

900
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:36,221
burning the temple gates.

901
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:38,181
So that they never close again.

902
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:39,516
And it's
all because

903
00:42:39,516 --> 00:42:41,226
the Emissary...

904
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,271
used the sword of stars.

905
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:48,066
And Trakor saw it all...

906
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:51,236
3,000 years ago.

907
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:04,123
I just want to say
that I appreciate

908
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:06,251
what you did
on the<i> Defiant.</i>

909
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:08,211
I hope it doesn't cause
you too much trouble

910
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:10,129
when you get
back to Cardassia.

911
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:13,299
My superiors in the Science
Ministry will protect me.

912
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:16,511
Frankly, I think Dejar's
in much more trouble than I.

913
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:19,264
The Order doesn't
reward failure.

914
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:21,933
Still, it was
a brave thing to do.

915
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:23,642
I didn't want you
to take the blame

916
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:25,520
for something that
wasn't your fault.

917
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,564
I know how proud you are

918
00:43:27,564 --> 00:43:29,107
of your work.

919
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:30,649
Too proud, sometimes.

920
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:33,694
It's gotten me into trouble,
now and again.

921
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:36,072
What's your wife's name?

922
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:38,116
Keiko.

923
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:40,701
A lucky woman.

924
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:55,550
Emissary, I'm sorry
I doubted you.

925
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:58,595
I realize now I let my
distrust of the Cardassians

926
00:43:58,595 --> 00:44:01,264
blind me to the
Prophets' words.

927
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:02,890
It seems that the
Prophets want peace

928
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,642
between your two
peoples, after all.

929
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,603
Perhaps so.

930
00:44:06,603 --> 00:44:10,106
There are signs that
Trakor's Fourth Prophecy

931
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:12,650
will soon come
to pass, as well.

932
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,569
Don't tell me that it has
something to do with me.

933
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:16,237
You, Commander?

934
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:19,407
Well, it is a prophecy
about the Emissary.

935
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:21,493
Tell me about it.

936
00:44:21,493 --> 00:44:23,620
Trakor's Fourth Prophecy

937
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:26,789
says that the Emissary
will face a fiery trial

938
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,082
and he'll be forced to choose...
