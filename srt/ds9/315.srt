1
00:00:03,732 --> 00:00:06,602
Station Log, Stardate 48543.2.

2
00:00:06,637 --> 00:00:08,436
A team of Cardassian scientists

3
00:00:08,474 --> 00:00:10,171
is coming to the station
to assist us

4
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:12,909
in deploying a subspace relay
in the Gamma Quadrant.

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,443
If successful,
it will allow communication

6
00:00:15,488 --> 00:00:18,085
through the wormhole
for the first time.

7
00:00:19,095 --> 00:00:20,689
I've assigned these quarters

8
00:00:20,732 --> 00:00:23,932
to the senior Cardassian
scientist, her name is Ulani.

9
00:00:23,972 --> 00:00:26,637
Her colleague, Gilora,
has the adjacent room.

10
00:00:26,677 --> 00:00:27,736
It's warm in here.

11
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,046
I take it you reset
the environmental controls.

12
00:00:30,084 --> 00:00:31,713
I also had Chief O'Brien
reprogram

13
00:00:31,754 --> 00:00:34,419
the replicators to provide
Cardassian food.

14
00:00:34,459 --> 00:00:35,688
Security measures?

15
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:37,129
I've assigned two of my people

16
00:00:37,165 --> 00:00:39,032
to follow the Cardassians
at all times.

17
00:00:39,068 --> 00:00:40,833
Fine, have them
keep their distance.

18
00:00:40,872 --> 00:00:41,999
I want the Cardassians

19
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,806
to feel like guests,
not prisoners.

20
00:00:43,845 --> 00:00:47,045
Commander, there are
still elements opposed

21
00:00:47,084 --> 00:00:49,920
to the peace treaty
between Cardassia and Bajor

22
00:00:49,957 --> 00:00:50,925
on both sides.

23
00:00:50,959 --> 00:00:52,257
We have to be prepared
for trouble.

24
00:00:52,361 --> 00:00:54,924
I realize that, but while
the Cardassians are here

25
00:00:54,967 --> 00:00:56,367
I want the Bajorans

26
00:00:56,403 --> 00:00:58,805
to get used to seeing them
walking on the Promenade...

27
00:00:58,842 --> 00:00:59,810
buying from their shops,

28
00:00:59,844 --> 00:01:01,176
eating from their restaurants...

29
00:01:01,213 --> 00:01:02,910
getting to know them
as something other

30
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,216
than brutal overseers.

31
00:01:07,058 --> 00:01:09,723
I just received the final update
from the Cardassians

32
00:01:09,763 --> 00:01:12,701
on the transceiver they designed
for the communications relay.

33
00:01:12,736 --> 00:01:13,795
How does it look?

34
00:01:13,838 --> 00:01:17,242
I'm still not convinced
it's going to work.

35
00:01:17,345 --> 00:01:19,247
The Cardassians seem
sure that it will.

36
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:20,408
I hope they're right.

37
00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:27,629
Whose quarters are these...

38
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:30,000
Gilora's or Ulani's?

39
00:01:30,037 --> 00:01:31,232
Ulani's.

40
00:01:31,273 --> 00:01:33,266
And how do you know their names?

41
00:01:33,377 --> 00:01:35,472
I was just informed an hour ago.

42
00:01:35,514 --> 00:01:38,782
Odo, please...

43
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:42,488
I have a bottle of <i>kanar</i>
for each of them...

44
00:01:42,528 --> 00:01:47,527
along with a personal
invitation to Quark's.

45
00:01:47,572 --> 00:01:48,904
Where did you get real <i>kanar?</i>

46
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,105
I've had three cases
in my storeroom

47
00:01:51,146 --> 00:01:52,478
since the occupation.

48
00:01:52,515 --> 00:01:56,478
There hasn't been much call
for it the past few years...

49
00:01:56,523 --> 00:01:58,322
but that's about to change.

50
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,853
There are only two Cardassians
coming to the station.

51
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:03,427
How much <i>kanar</i> do you think
they can drink?

52
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,067
There may only be two for now,
but there'll be more

53
00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:07,509
thanks to the peace treaty.

54
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:10,038
And as the 34th Rule
of Acquisition states

55
00:02:10,084 --> 00:02:11,849
"Peace is good for business."

56
00:02:11,887 --> 00:02:14,289
That's the 35th Rule.

57
00:02:14,359 --> 00:02:16,295
Oh, you're right.
What's the 34th?

58
00:02:16,363 --> 00:02:18,560
"War is good for business."

59
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,627
It's easy to get them confused.

60
00:02:20,672 --> 00:02:23,906
The way I see it, it won't be
long before there's a permanent

61
00:02:23,945 --> 00:02:25,847
Cardassian presence
on the station...

62
00:02:25,882 --> 00:02:28,820
scientists, diplomats...

63
00:02:28,855 --> 00:02:30,050
spies.

64
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,960
And they'll all
be welcome at Quark's.

65
00:02:32,996 --> 00:02:35,057
As long as they can pay.

66
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,231
Rumor has it that the shop
next door to mine

67
00:02:38,273 --> 00:02:40,106
is going out of business.

68
00:02:40,144 --> 00:02:43,675
I'm thinking of renting it
and setting up

69
00:02:43,718 --> 00:02:45,688
a few Cardassian
gaming concessions.

70
00:02:45,722 --> 00:02:49,662
There'll be no live vole fights
on the Promenade, Quark.

71
00:02:49,697 --> 00:02:50,926
I would never be party

72
00:02:50,965 --> 00:02:53,994
to anything so cruel
and inhumane.

73
00:02:54,038 --> 00:02:57,204
But, of course,
if some Cardassians

74
00:02:57,244 --> 00:03:00,512
happen to bring
their voles along

75
00:03:00,551 --> 00:03:02,714
and they happened
to get into a fight

76
00:03:02,756 --> 00:03:05,226
I could hardly be
held responsible for...

77
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,025
Oh, yes, you could.

78
00:03:07,064 --> 00:03:08,761
And you will be.

79
00:03:10,404 --> 00:03:12,340
Fine.

80
00:03:12,441 --> 00:03:15,038
Forget the vole fights.

81
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,343
But I'll tell you this.

82
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:18,009
Good <i>kanar</i> is hard to find.

83
00:03:18,053 --> 00:03:19,784
And I have three cases of it.

84
00:03:19,823 --> 00:03:22,989
But that's just the beginning.

85
00:03:23,029 --> 00:03:25,899
Soon, Quark's will become
known as the best place

86
00:03:25,935 --> 00:03:28,566
for Cardassian food and drink
in this sector.

87
00:03:28,607 --> 00:03:31,100
I'll probably set up
daily shipments from Cardassia.

88
00:03:31,146 --> 00:03:35,086
I may even need to buy
my own transport ship.

89
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,890
Quark, this <i>kanar</i> has gone bad.

90
00:03:38,928 --> 00:03:40,226
What?!

91
00:03:40,264 --> 00:03:43,395
I suggest you take your bottles
and leave, Quark

92
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,064
before I have you arrested

93
00:03:45,107 --> 00:03:47,441
for attempting
to poison our guests.

94
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:02,400
Excuse me, Commander.

95
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:04,570
There's a Vedek Yarka
here to see you.

96
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:06,445
He says it's urgent.

97
00:04:08,754 --> 00:04:11,054
Thank you for seeing me,
Emissary.

98
00:04:11,092 --> 00:04:12,959
What can I do for you?

99
00:04:12,996 --> 00:04:14,932
I am here with a warning
from the Prophets.

100
00:04:14,967 --> 00:04:16,869
They don't want you
to let the Cardassians

101
00:04:16,904 --> 00:04:18,065
come aboard this station.

102
00:04:18,106 --> 00:04:21,773
If you do, you will bring
destruction on us all.

103
00:06:25,734 --> 00:06:27,897
Are you making
some sort of threat, Vedek?

104
00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:28,998
Not at all.

105
00:06:29,042 --> 00:06:30,909
I'm simply telling you
what was foretold

106
00:06:30,945 --> 00:06:32,174
in the ancient texts.

107
00:06:32,214 --> 00:06:33,774
Ancient texts...
you mean a prophecy?

108
00:06:33,817 --> 00:06:35,183
Trakor's Third.

109
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,124
When he first encountered
the Orb of Change.

110
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,651
I'm afraid I don't know it.

111
00:06:39,696 --> 00:06:41,928
Perhaps you should
make more time

112
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:43,333
to study the texts, child.

113
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,365
Are you saying that the arrival
of the Cardassian scientists

114
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:48,003
was foretold
in a Bajoran prophecy?

115
00:06:48,046 --> 00:06:49,014
Exactly.

116
00:06:49,048 --> 00:06:50,847
Trakor's words are clear.

117
00:06:50,884 --> 00:06:54,949
"When the river wakes, stirred
once more to Janir's side

118
00:06:54,993 --> 00:06:58,694
three vipers will return
to their nest in the sky."

119
00:06:58,734 --> 00:07:01,102
The river has awoken, Emissary.

120
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:03,609
The Qui'al Dam was just
put back into operation

121
00:07:03,643 --> 00:07:05,111
to divert water to the city.

122
00:07:05,147 --> 00:07:07,549
Just as Trakor prophesied
over 3,000 years ago.

123
00:07:07,585 --> 00:07:10,148
And even now, the vipers
are making their way here.

124
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,889
And I take it you think
the vipers are a reference

125
00:07:12,928 --> 00:07:14,362
to the Cardassian scientists?

126
00:07:14,398 --> 00:07:18,270
Yes, and this station
is their nest in the sky.

127
00:07:21,312 --> 00:07:23,977
And how exactly
is their presence here

128
00:07:24,018 --> 00:07:26,511
going to bring destruction
on us all?

129
00:07:26,556 --> 00:07:27,922
Trakor said

130
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:31,056
"When the vipers try to peer
through the temple gates

131
00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:33,696
"a sword of stars
will appear in the heavens.

132
00:07:33,737 --> 00:07:36,971
The temple will burn, and
the gates will be cast open."

133
00:07:37,011 --> 00:07:39,447
You must not let
the Cardassians come here.

134
00:07:39,549 --> 00:07:42,453
You must not let them
violate the Celestial Temple

135
00:07:42,521 --> 00:07:43,887
or they will destroy it

136
00:07:43,924 --> 00:07:46,828
and Bajor will be cut off
from the Prophets forever.

137
00:07:46,863 --> 00:07:49,699
Slow down.
Now, let me get this straight.

138
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:53,196
You're saying that the vipers...
the Cardassians...

139
00:07:53,243 --> 00:07:54,575
are going to destroy
the wormhole?

140
00:07:54,612 --> 00:07:55,602
Don't you see?

141
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:58,414
This communications relay
you hope to create

142
00:07:58,453 --> 00:08:00,013
is part of the prophecy.

143
00:08:00,057 --> 00:08:03,861
It will allow the vipers to peer
through the temple gates...

144
00:08:03,897 --> 00:08:05,799
the wormhole, as you call it.

145
00:08:05,834 --> 00:08:08,738
And if they do, the temple
will be destroyed.

146
00:08:08,773 --> 00:08:12,075
Even if we accept that
the Cardassians are the vipers

147
00:08:12,114 --> 00:08:14,950
there are only two of them
coming, not three.

148
00:08:14,986 --> 00:08:17,583
Isn't it possible
that there are other mistakes

149
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,959
in your interpretation
of the prophecy as well?

150
00:08:19,996 --> 00:08:22,968
There will be three vipers,
you will see.

151
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,131
Do you understand
what this communications relay

152
00:08:25,173 --> 00:08:26,300
could mean for Bajor?

153
00:08:26,342 --> 00:08:28,744
If it works,
we'll be able to stay in contact

154
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,477
with ships
in the Gamma Quadrant.

155
00:08:30,584 --> 00:08:33,420
It'll facilitate exploration

156
00:08:33,456 --> 00:08:35,449
help us monitor
Dominion activity

157
00:08:35,494 --> 00:08:37,487
give us warning
in case of an attack.

158
00:08:37,564 --> 00:08:40,593
None of that matters.

159
00:08:40,637 --> 00:08:41,935
You must listen to me.

160
00:08:41,973 --> 00:08:44,375
I know it is difficult
for you to accept

161
00:08:44,412 --> 00:08:46,109
because you are not Bajoran.

162
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:48,619
I have studied the prophecies
all my life.

163
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,055
We are on the verge
of a great disaster.

164
00:08:51,092 --> 00:08:53,825
Is the Bajoran Assembly
aware of this prophecy?

165
00:08:53,863 --> 00:08:55,229
Yes...

166
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:56,998
as is the Kai herself.

167
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,527
Yet, they still want us
to proceed

168
00:08:58,606 --> 00:09:00,872
with the establishment
of a communications relay.

169
00:09:00,911 --> 00:09:02,972
They have chosen
to ignore the signs.

170
00:09:03,015 --> 00:09:05,110
And that is why I came
to you, Emissary

171
00:09:05,153 --> 00:09:06,713
because I have faith in you.

172
00:09:06,756 --> 00:09:09,489
I know that you will do
what must be done.

173
00:09:09,595 --> 00:09:11,758
Vedek...

174
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:14,498
I have the utmost respect
for your beliefs

175
00:09:14,605 --> 00:09:18,375
but I have no intention
of calling this project off.

176
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:24,989
I hope that you will reconsider,
Emissary.

177
00:09:25,026 --> 00:09:27,691
My followers and I
will remain on the station

178
00:09:27,731 --> 00:09:29,792
and pray that you
change your mind.

179
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:32,773
You are free to do that,
of course.

180
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,858
Major, have Odo find out
everything he can

181
00:09:41,893 --> 00:09:44,363
about Vedek Yarka
and his followers.

182
00:09:44,398 --> 00:09:46,527
I don't want them
making any trouble

183
00:09:46,569 --> 00:09:48,436
while the Cardassians are here.

184
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,179
I'm Commander Benjamin Sisko

185
00:10:12,221 --> 00:10:15,125
and, on behalf of the
United Federation of Planets

186
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,628
and Starfleet Command

187
00:10:16,662 --> 00:10:19,634
I'd like to welcome you
to Deep Space 9.

188
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,170
Thank you, Commander.

189
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:22,868
I'm Dr. Ulani Belor.

190
00:10:22,908 --> 00:10:24,069
Gilora Rejal.

191
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:27,378
The Cardassian government
wishes to express its gratitude

192
00:10:27,417 --> 00:10:29,148
to the Federation for agreeing

193
00:10:29,188 --> 00:10:31,055
to work together
on this project.

194
00:10:31,091 --> 00:10:34,393
It is our hope that it is the
first of many such projects

195
00:10:34,431 --> 00:10:35,763
between our peoples.

196
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,567
That's a hope I can
assure you we share.

197
00:10:38,606 --> 00:10:41,169
This is my First Officer,
Major Kira.

198
00:10:41,212 --> 00:10:43,580
And on behalf of the Bajoran
provisional government

199
00:10:43,616 --> 00:10:44,675
I'd like to welcome you.

200
00:10:44,785 --> 00:10:46,276
It is our belief
that this project

201
00:10:46,322 --> 00:10:48,349
will mark the beginning
of a new era of peace

202
00:10:48,393 --> 00:10:50,556
for Bajor and Cardassia.

203
00:10:50,597 --> 00:10:52,157
Thank you, Major.

204
00:10:53,836 --> 00:10:54,963
Well...

205
00:10:55,005 --> 00:10:58,171
now that we've gotten
the formalities out of the way

206
00:10:58,213 --> 00:10:59,203
how was your trip?

207
00:10:59,248 --> 00:11:02,015
Exhausting.

208
00:11:02,053 --> 00:11:03,613
We spent most of it rehearsing

209
00:11:03,656 --> 00:11:05,922
what we were going to say
when we got here.

210
00:11:05,961 --> 00:11:07,658
We're scientists,
not diplomats.

211
00:11:07,698 --> 00:11:09,132
You did very well.

212
00:11:09,167 --> 00:11:12,537
Please feel free to let
the Central Command know that.

213
00:11:12,574 --> 00:11:14,339
In the past few days

214
00:11:14,378 --> 00:11:17,680
I've been contacted by Guls
I haven't even heard of

215
00:11:17,784 --> 00:11:21,690
all of them wanting to emphasize
how important this mission is.

216
00:11:21,792 --> 00:11:22,987
I know what you mean.

217
00:11:23,028 --> 00:11:24,394
I've gotten three calls

218
00:11:24,431 --> 00:11:26,264
from Starfleet Command
just this morning.

219
00:11:28,506 --> 00:11:29,701
Major Kira

220
00:11:29,808 --> 00:11:33,076
I want to thank you personally
for allowing us to come here.

221
00:11:33,115 --> 00:11:34,083
Me?

222
00:11:34,117 --> 00:11:35,210
You're the ranking

223
00:11:35,253 --> 00:11:36,882
Bajoran officer on this station.

224
00:11:36,922 --> 00:11:38,413
I'm sure we wouldn't be here

225
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:40,759
if you had been opposed
to working with us.

226
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,831
I'll work with anyone
who's interested in peace.

227
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:47,639
I'm glad we already
have so much in common.

228
00:11:49,481 --> 00:11:53,387
Well, why don't I show you
to your quarters?

229
00:11:59,835 --> 00:12:01,668
The signaling platform
we've designed

230
00:12:01,706 --> 00:12:03,140
is intended to be positioned

231
00:12:03,175 --> 00:12:05,111
in the Gamma Quadrant,
at this point...

232
00:12:05,145 --> 00:12:07,708
two kilometers from the
far mouth of the wormhole.

233
00:12:07,751 --> 00:12:11,155
Our transceiver is being
configured to fit inside it

234
00:12:11,191 --> 00:12:12,591
and use its existing power grid.

235
00:12:12,627 --> 00:12:13,890
A similar transceiver

236
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:17,495
will be put in place
here on Terok Nor...

237
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:19,439
on Deep Space 9.

238
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,207
Ulani, I've looked over
your design specifications.

239
00:12:23,249 --> 00:12:25,412
I'm not clear on what
sort of carrier wave

240
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,682
you're planning on using

241
00:12:26,722 --> 00:12:29,853
to cut through the interference
on the inside of the wormhole.

242
00:12:29,895 --> 00:12:33,494
We're planning to test various
types of soliton pulses.

243
00:12:33,536 --> 00:12:36,508
One of them should maintain
the required signal integrity.

244
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:39,139
We tried something similar about
a year ago without much success.

245
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:42,516
Yes, the Bajoran government
made your data available to us.

246
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:44,456
I believe the problem
had to do with

247
00:12:44,491 --> 00:12:46,893
the phase variance
in your transceiver coils.

248
00:12:46,929 --> 00:12:49,457
Well, I configured
those coils myself.

249
00:12:49,501 --> 00:12:52,667
The variance was less
than.01 percent.

250
00:12:52,707 --> 00:12:55,804
Which, as you saw,
was unacceptably high.

251
00:12:55,914 --> 00:12:58,077
Our new design has less
than half that variance.

252
00:12:58,118 --> 00:12:59,951
You don't mind
if I look at the specs?

253
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:02,755
If you think it's necessary.

254
00:13:02,861 --> 00:13:04,090
Commander...

255
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,066
we'll need to make
a few adjustments

256
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,197
to the station's signaling array
so that it can accommodate

257
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,768
the type of transmissions
we're planning to use.

258
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:14,213
Chief O'Brien's people
can assist you with that.

259
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,913
And when you're ready

260
00:13:15,954 --> 00:13:18,892
we'll take the <i>Defiant</i>
to the Gamma Quadrant

261
00:13:18,926 --> 00:13:21,328
deploy the communications relay
and start running tests.

262
00:13:21,365 --> 00:13:23,164
Excellent.

263
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:26,696
Well, it's been a long day.

264
00:13:26,742 --> 00:13:29,646
We'd like to get some rest
so we can start fresh tomorrow.

265
00:13:29,681 --> 00:13:31,947
I'll have someone
show you to your quarters.

266
00:13:31,986 --> 00:13:33,979
Thank you,
but that won't be necessary.

267
00:13:34,023 --> 00:13:35,013
Thank you.

268
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:41,703
Now, those are about

269
00:13:41,739 --> 00:13:44,677
the two friendliest vipers
I have ever met.

270
00:13:44,711 --> 00:13:47,342
I'll explain later.

271
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:52,023
Commander, I almost
forgot to tell you.

272
00:13:52,059 --> 00:13:53,688
Another colleague of ours, Dejar

273
00:13:53,729 --> 00:13:55,528
will be arriving later today.

274
00:13:55,567 --> 00:13:56,694
I'll arrange quarters.

275
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,466
Thank you.

276
00:14:00,008 --> 00:14:01,169
So...

277
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,303
we need to discuss

278
00:14:02,347 --> 00:14:04,317
what we're going to do about...

279
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:08,415
What is it, Major?

280
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:11,829
There are going to be
three of them.

281
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:12,889
Yes?

282
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:16,463
Three vipers...

283
00:14:16,508 --> 00:14:19,139
just like in the prophecy.

284
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:32,612
It turns out that Vedek Yarka
is no longer a Vedek at all.

285
00:14:32,647 --> 00:14:34,674
He was stripped of his title
two months ago.

286
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,980
Why?

287
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,990
Officially, for teachings

288
00:14:38,024 --> 00:14:40,621
not in keeping
with the Bajoran faith.

289
00:14:40,663 --> 00:14:44,694
But according to my sources,
he was defrocked because he led

290
00:14:44,738 --> 00:14:47,904
a series of protests
against the Vedek Assembly

291
00:14:47,944 --> 00:14:50,472
when they endorsed the peace
treaty with Cardassia.

292
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:52,816
So Yarka may be
using this prophecy

293
00:14:52,854 --> 00:14:55,324
as a way to scuttle
the peace treaty.

294
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:57,488
That would seem
to be his agenda.

295
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,661
And it's probably coloring
his view of the prophecy

296
00:15:00,703 --> 00:15:03,334
just as your agenda
colors how you see it.

297
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,504
I don't have an agenda, Odo.

298
00:15:05,546 --> 00:15:07,880
I want this project to succeed

299
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:10,114
because I want
the peace treaty to succeed.

300
00:15:10,155 --> 00:15:13,559
If I thought for a moment
that there was any possibility

301
00:15:13,596 --> 00:15:15,293
that this communications relay

302
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:17,165
could cause damage
to the wormhole

303
00:15:17,202 --> 00:15:18,967
I'd put a stop to it right now.

304
00:15:19,006 --> 00:15:22,445
That's not the agenda
I was referring to, Commander.

305
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,470
Oh?

306
00:15:23,516 --> 00:15:24,643
I was referring

307
00:15:24,685 --> 00:15:27,121
to your desire
to distance yourself

308
00:15:27,156 --> 00:15:29,126
from the title of Emissary.

309
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,723
It's just an observation,
of course

310
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:33,735
but it's always seemed to me

311
00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:36,741
that you've never been
comfortable with it.

312
00:15:42,252 --> 00:15:44,849
I can't deny that.

313
00:15:47,897 --> 00:15:49,126
Are you suggesting

314
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:52,002
that I'm dismissing
this prophecy too easily

315
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:54,602
because I don't want
to be the Emissary?

316
00:15:54,644 --> 00:15:56,341
I'm not suggesting anything

317
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,441
but it's been my experience

318
00:15:58,486 --> 00:16:02,085
that all humanoids have
an agenda of some sort

319
00:16:02,126 --> 00:16:05,257
and that their agendas
can influence them

320
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,826
without their even realizing it.

321
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,572
Morn came by the Infirmary
this afternoon.

322
00:16:12,614 --> 00:16:14,641
He had an acute case
of food poisoning.

323
00:16:14,684 --> 00:16:17,349
Morn? I didn't think anything
could make him sick.

324
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:18,414
Well, he said he had

325
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,257
a bad glass of <i>kanar</i>
at Quark's.

326
00:16:20,295 --> 00:16:21,763
He should ask for a refund.

327
00:16:21,832 --> 00:16:23,095
Apparently, it was on the house.

328
00:16:23,134 --> 00:16:25,935
Major, may I have
a word with you?

329
00:16:25,973 --> 00:16:27,100
I'll see you later.

330
00:16:27,142 --> 00:16:29,612
What can I do for you, Vedek?

331
00:16:29,648 --> 00:16:32,141
Have you been able
to convince the Emissary

332
00:16:32,186 --> 00:16:33,746
to reconsider his decision?

333
00:16:33,789 --> 00:16:36,488
I haven't tried
and I'm not planning to.

334
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:37,757
But you must.

335
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:39,790
If not, the Celestial
Temple will be destroyed.

336
00:16:39,901 --> 00:16:41,803
I'm not convinced
that's going to happen.

337
00:16:41,905 --> 00:16:43,203
Don't you believe
in the prophecies?

338
00:16:43,241 --> 00:16:44,266
Yes.

339
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,278
And don't you believe

340
00:16:45,312 --> 00:16:46,803
that Commander Sisko
is the Emissary?

341
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:50,218
Vedek, you have to understand
my position here.

342
00:16:50,255 --> 00:16:53,193
Commander Sisko is
my superior officer.

343
00:16:53,228 --> 00:16:55,460
I have to deal with him
on that basis first.

344
00:16:55,498 --> 00:16:57,559
So you do believe
he is the Emissary.

345
00:16:57,604 --> 00:16:59,471
You just don't want
him to know that.

346
00:16:59,506 --> 00:17:01,476
I understand.

347
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,478
You want him to know

348
00:17:02,512 --> 00:17:04,141
that he can count
on you as an officer

349
00:17:04,183 --> 00:17:05,310
under his command.

350
00:17:05,352 --> 00:17:07,983
You want to keep your work
and your faith separate.

351
00:17:08,024 --> 00:17:09,960
Yes, and for three years now,
I have.

352
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:12,090
I'm afraid
that's no longer possible.

353
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:13,795
The Prophets have chosen you

354
00:17:13,836 --> 00:17:16,204
to help the Emissary
make this decision.

355
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,610
A decision that has profound
implications for all of Bajor.

356
00:17:19,648 --> 00:17:22,050
You must convince him
to make the Cardassians leave

357
00:17:22,085 --> 00:17:23,679
before the sword of stars
appears.

358
00:17:23,722 --> 00:17:26,956
Vedek, if you're asking me to...

359
00:17:26,995 --> 00:17:29,831
It is not I who is asking,
it is the Prophets.

360
00:17:29,868 --> 00:17:31,838
If you turn your back
on them now

361
00:17:31,872 --> 00:17:33,637
you're abandoning your faith.

362
00:17:33,676 --> 00:17:35,475
And without your faith, Nerys

363
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,880
what do you have left?

364
00:17:46,367 --> 00:17:48,303
I prefer the serialist poets

365
00:17:48,338 --> 00:17:51,504
from the First Republic,
like Iloja of Prim.

366
00:17:51,544 --> 00:17:54,209
He's easily my favorite
Cardassian writer.

367
00:17:54,249 --> 00:17:56,583
It is so rare to meet
a non-Cardassian

368
00:17:56,621 --> 00:17:58,648
who appreciates our literature.

369
00:17:58,692 --> 00:17:59,785
I took an interest

370
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,230
because I had
the chance to meet Iloja.

371
00:18:02,265 --> 00:18:03,233
You knew him?

372
00:18:03,267 --> 00:18:04,633
One of my previous hosts

373
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:08,075
Tobin, met him while he
was in exile on Vulcan.

374
00:18:08,111 --> 00:18:11,140
As I recall,
he had quite a temper.

375
00:18:11,183 --> 00:18:12,242
Really?

376
00:18:12,285 --> 00:18:15,724
I believe this is the party
you're looking for.

377
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,194
Dejar.

378
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:19,631
May I introduce Jadzia Dax

379
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:21,637
and Miles O'Brien.

380
00:18:21,671 --> 00:18:23,641
Our colleague, Dejar.

381
00:18:23,675 --> 00:18:25,611
We weren't expecting
you so soon.

382
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,277
I was able to arrange
special transportation.

383
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:29,877
I'm sure you were.

384
00:18:31,057 --> 00:18:33,824
I took the liberty
of preparing

385
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:37,666
a few of our special
Cardassian delicacies.

386
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:43,914
Tojal in <i>yamok</i> sauce.

387
00:18:44,016 --> 00:18:45,382
Regova eggs.

388
00:18:45,418 --> 00:18:48,015
All fresh, not replicated.

389
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:53,364
Well, enjoy.

390
00:18:57,242 --> 00:18:58,505
Is something wrong?

391
00:18:58,544 --> 00:18:59,773
It's just...

392
00:18:59,814 --> 00:19:03,879
I don't really care
for Cardassian cuisine.

393
00:19:03,989 --> 00:19:07,189
We try to avoid it
whenever possible.

394
00:19:09,032 --> 00:19:11,560
Fortunately, those of us
in the Science Ministry

395
00:19:11,604 --> 00:19:14,303
are provided with a wide variety
of off-world food.

396
00:19:14,343 --> 00:19:16,370
Yes, we're
actually quite spoiled.

397
00:19:16,413 --> 00:19:18,713
Some of us even think
of ourselves

398
00:19:18,752 --> 00:19:21,154
as better
than the average Cardassian.

399
00:19:28,571 --> 00:19:30,939
The main switching relays
are in here.

400
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:33,503
I think we should hook
your transceiver

401
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:35,780
to the ODN interface
through the...

402
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:37,914
What happened
to these couplings?

403
00:19:37,957 --> 00:19:40,952
What? Oh, I-I made
some modifications.

404
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,966
Well, these relays
don't have nearly

405
00:19:43,034 --> 00:19:44,970
as much carrying capacity
as before.

406
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:46,438
They won't be able to handle

407
00:19:46,473 --> 00:19:48,340
the signal load
from the transceiver.

408
00:19:48,377 --> 00:19:50,176
Well, in order
to bring the system

409
00:19:50,215 --> 00:19:53,119
up to Starfleet code, I had
to take out the couplings

410
00:19:53,154 --> 00:19:55,647
to make room
for a secondary backup.

411
00:19:55,692 --> 00:19:58,823
Starfleet code requires
a second backup?

412
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,666
In case the first one fails.

413
00:20:01,705 --> 00:20:04,472
What are the chances that
both a primary system

414
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:07,174
and its backup would
fail at the same time?

415
00:20:07,215 --> 00:20:09,447
Well, it's very unlikely,
but, in a crunch

416
00:20:09,486 --> 00:20:12,390
I wouldn't like to be caught
without a second backup.

417
00:20:14,096 --> 00:20:15,895
Well!

418
00:20:16,935 --> 00:20:18,233
What's done is done.

419
00:20:18,271 --> 00:20:21,334
I'll try to figure out
what we should do next.

420
00:20:21,377 --> 00:20:23,279
Well, I think our best
bet would be to go...

421
00:20:23,314 --> 00:20:26,411
Please, please just
give me a moment to think.

422
00:20:26,453 --> 00:20:28,685
Fine.

423
00:20:28,724 --> 00:20:30,660
I'll just sit here quietly.

424
00:20:30,695 --> 00:20:34,965
Huh. In that case, could you
get me a cup of red leaf tea?

425
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:40,280
Why not?

426
00:20:54,476 --> 00:20:56,275
We've loaded
the communications relay

427
00:20:56,313 --> 00:20:57,781
into the <i>Defiant's</i> cargo bay.

428
00:20:57,817 --> 00:20:58,785
Good.

429
00:20:58,819 --> 00:21:00,686
How are Chief O'Brien
and Gilora coming along?

430
00:21:00,722 --> 00:21:02,213
They've run into
some kind of problem

431
00:21:02,258 --> 00:21:03,624
but the Chief says
the transceiver

432
00:21:03,661 --> 00:21:05,221
should be on line
in about four hours.

433
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,234
We won't be ready much
before that anyway.

434
00:21:07,268 --> 00:21:09,738
We've received clearance
from Ops, Commander.

435
00:21:09,774 --> 00:21:12,337
Release docking clamps

436
00:21:12,379 --> 00:21:14,246
and set a course
for the wormhole.

437
00:21:24,804 --> 00:21:26,204
Full scan.

438
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,107
No sign of Dominion activity.

439
00:21:28,177 --> 00:21:29,942
No other ships in the area.

440
00:21:29,981 --> 00:21:32,349
All right,
take us into position.

441
00:21:32,385 --> 00:21:34,821
Stand by to deploy the relay...

442
00:21:34,857 --> 00:21:35,825
Wait a minute.

443
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:37,293
What is it?

444
00:21:37,328 --> 00:21:40,664
I'm reading a large mass
of ice and ionized gas

445
00:21:40,701 --> 00:21:43,400
entering sensor range,
bearing 215 mark 3.

446
00:21:43,441 --> 00:21:45,308
It looks like a rogue comet.

447
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,870
Let's have a look.

448
00:21:46,915 --> 00:21:48,349
Put it on screen.

449
00:21:52,893 --> 00:21:53,861
It's beautiful.

450
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,158
Its core contains

451
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,633
unusually high concentrations
of silithium.

452
00:21:57,669 --> 00:21:59,832
That's why its tail
is so bright.

453
00:21:59,874 --> 00:22:02,208
The sword of stars.

454
00:22:11,484 --> 00:22:15,720
That's a very colorful way
to describe a comet, Major.

455
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,436
It's just a figure of speech.

456
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,341
Well, your sword of stars

457
00:22:27,382 --> 00:22:29,249
is going to pass
very near the wormhole

458
00:22:29,286 --> 00:22:32,190
but not close enough
to interfere with our plans.

459
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:34,092
We're in position, Benjamin.

460
00:22:34,129 --> 00:22:36,862
Begin a final systems check
on the relay station.

461
00:22:36,902 --> 00:22:38,963
I want to deploy it
within the hour.

462
00:22:48,024 --> 00:22:51,485
Major, can I have
a word with you?

463
00:23:01,617 --> 00:23:03,348
The sword of stars?

464
00:23:03,387 --> 00:23:06,359
It certainly looked
like that to me.

465
00:23:06,393 --> 00:23:07,452
That's open to debate

466
00:23:07,495 --> 00:23:09,863
but what is not debatable
is that this prophecy

467
00:23:09,901 --> 00:23:11,962
has no place
on the Bridge of the <i>Defiant</i>

468
00:23:12,005 --> 00:23:13,975
especially in front
of the Cardassians.

469
00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:16,206
At the moment, they are
not even aware of it

470
00:23:16,246 --> 00:23:17,806
and I want to keep it that way.

471
00:23:17,849 --> 00:23:20,149
You're right.

472
00:23:20,188 --> 00:23:21,748
It won't happen again.

473
00:23:22,792 --> 00:23:23,885
Well...

474
00:23:28,204 --> 00:23:29,695
I take it, Major

475
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:33,976
that you believe
the prophecy is coming true.

476
00:23:34,016 --> 00:23:36,544
Yes, I do.

477
00:23:36,587 --> 00:23:39,559
So you think I should
call this mission off?

478
00:23:39,593 --> 00:23:41,722
Look at what's happened already.

479
00:23:41,764 --> 00:23:44,759
The river has returned to Janir,
the three vipers

480
00:23:44,803 --> 00:23:46,294
now the sword of stars...

481
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,107
each of them predicted
by Trakor's prophecy.

482
00:23:51,316 --> 00:23:53,309
And then there's you...

483
00:23:53,354 --> 00:23:55,847
the Emissary.

484
00:23:57,295 --> 00:23:59,265
You're here.

485
00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:03,000
You have a decision to make,
just like in the prophecy.

486
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:07,071
Do you really believe
that I'm the Emissary?

487
00:24:11,256 --> 00:24:13,192
I guess I always have.

488
00:24:13,227 --> 00:24:18,762
I... never wanted
to admit it to myself.

489
00:24:19,906 --> 00:24:23,937
It's hard to work for someone
who's a religious icon.

490
00:24:32,265 --> 00:24:35,169
I hope I don't offend
your beliefs

491
00:24:35,204 --> 00:24:40,408
but I don't see myself as an
icon, religious or otherwise.

492
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:44,388
I'm a Starfleet officer, and
I have a mission to accomplish.

493
00:24:44,422 --> 00:24:48,089
If I call it off, it has to be
for some concrete reason

494
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:53,095
something solid,
something Starfleet.

495
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,076
All right, how about this?

496
00:24:55,111 --> 00:24:57,274
The Prophets...

497
00:24:57,315 --> 00:24:59,785
the aliens who live
in the wormhole

498
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,981
as you call them

499
00:25:01,023 --> 00:25:02,252
exist outside of linear time.

500
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,262
They know the past,
present and future.

501
00:25:04,296 --> 00:25:05,959
Agreed.

502
00:25:05,998 --> 00:25:08,731
It seems perfectly reasonable
that they could've communicated

503
00:25:08,771 --> 00:25:12,472
their knowledge of the future
to a Bajoran named Trakor.

504
00:25:12,512 --> 00:25:15,348
He wrote down that knowledge
in the form of a prophecy

505
00:25:15,384 --> 00:25:17,479
and now, 3,000 years later

506
00:25:17,522 --> 00:25:20,323
we are seeing
those events unfold.

507
00:25:20,361 --> 00:25:23,595
To me, that reasoning
sounds concrete, solid.

508
00:25:23,634 --> 00:25:25,501
I'd even call it "Starfleet."

509
00:25:29,346 --> 00:25:31,943
But that all hinges
on how you interpret

510
00:25:31,984 --> 00:25:34,216
an ancient text
that's been translated

511
00:25:34,256 --> 00:25:37,422
and retranslated
over the centuries.

512
00:25:37,462 --> 00:25:40,332
Words that were couched
in metaphor to begin with.

513
00:25:40,368 --> 00:25:43,101
I'm sorry, Major

514
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,235
but where you see
a sword of stars

515
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:46,907
I see a comet.

516
00:25:46,947 --> 00:25:50,978
Where you see vipers,
I see three scientists.

517
00:25:51,022 --> 00:25:55,156
And where you see the Emissary

518
00:25:55,197 --> 00:25:58,363
I see a Starfleet officer.

519
00:25:59,539 --> 00:26:00,802
Dax to Sisko.

520
00:26:00,841 --> 00:26:02,070
Go ahead.

521
00:26:02,111 --> 00:26:04,776
We're ready to deploy the relay.

522
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:10,287
On my way.

523
00:26:28,464 --> 00:26:29,432
All right.

524
00:26:29,466 --> 00:26:31,333
Now we just have
to shunt the ODN line

525
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:33,033
through the secondary
field coils.

526
00:26:33,072 --> 00:26:34,165
We can't do that.

527
00:26:34,209 --> 00:26:35,507
Why not?

528
00:26:35,544 --> 00:26:38,209
Because those coils
aren't configured

529
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,981
to handle ODN output.

530
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,010
Why not?

531
00:26:41,055 --> 00:26:42,718
Did you modify them, too?

532
00:26:42,792 --> 00:26:44,318
Actually, I replaced them.

533
00:26:44,362 --> 00:26:46,662
They were always
shorting out on us.

534
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,966
Frankly, I don't
see how this station

535
00:26:49,004 --> 00:26:51,201
kept running during
the occupation.

536
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:52,643
Why didn't you tell me

537
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:55,241
you'd replaced
the secondary field coils?

538
00:26:55,284 --> 00:26:56,445
If you had told me

539
00:26:56,486 --> 00:26:59,287
what you were planning
to do, I would have.

540
00:26:59,325 --> 00:27:01,990
I don't have time
to explain everything.

541
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:05,127
What? You think I won't
be able to understand?

542
00:27:05,171 --> 00:27:07,607
It has been
my experience that it...

543
00:27:07,642 --> 00:27:09,908
What?

544
00:27:09,946 --> 00:27:12,679
That humans aren't
good engineers?

545
00:27:12,718 --> 00:27:17,387
No, not humans... males.

546
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:18,954
I beg your pardon?

547
00:27:18,997 --> 00:27:22,299
Men just don't seem to have
a head for this sort of thing.

548
00:27:22,338 --> 00:27:24,935
That's why women
dominate the sciences.

549
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,344
Maybe on Cardassia,
but on this station

550
00:27:27,381 --> 00:27:29,248
this man is Chief of Operations

551
00:27:29,285 --> 00:27:31,755
and I know more
about these systems

552
00:27:31,823 --> 00:27:33,759
than anyone, including you.

553
00:27:33,794 --> 00:27:36,493
I think I know
what the problem is

554
00:27:36,533 --> 00:27:39,733
so if you want to get
that transceiver on line

555
00:27:39,772 --> 00:27:43,439
hand me the laser-torch
and give me some room.

556
00:28:04,189 --> 00:28:05,157
Are we ready on this end?

557
00:28:05,191 --> 00:28:06,625
Almost. I'm just
about to activate

558
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,687
the relay's transmission array.

559
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:09,698
Dejar?

560
00:28:09,732 --> 00:28:11,964
Standing by.

561
00:28:13,005 --> 00:28:16,570
I am receiving
the relay's test signal.

562
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:18,310
Target the signaling array
toward the wormhole

563
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:21,015
and initiate a carrier wave
in the delta band frequency.

564
00:28:21,055 --> 00:28:22,546
Initiating carrier wave.

565
00:28:22,592 --> 00:28:24,994
If they receive it
on the station

566
00:28:25,029 --> 00:28:26,555
they'll send
an acknowledging signal

567
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,331
in the same frequency.

568
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:34,910
I'm not receiving anything.

569
00:28:34,949 --> 00:28:37,546
Then we have to assume
it didn't work.

570
00:28:37,588 --> 00:28:40,024
Let's try
the theta band frequency.

571
00:28:40,059 --> 00:28:42,529
Initiating carrier wave.

572
00:28:46,205 --> 00:28:47,537
Something's wrong.

573
00:28:47,575 --> 00:28:50,138
I'm picking up a neutrino surge
from the wormhole.

574
00:28:55,724 --> 00:28:57,090
Report!

575
00:28:57,127 --> 00:28:59,461
Somehow the carrier wave
caused the wormhole to open.

576
00:28:59,499 --> 00:29:02,437
The wormhole's gravity well has
increased by a factor of three.

577
00:29:02,471 --> 00:29:05,204
Terminate the carrier wave
and maintain our position.

578
00:29:11,204 --> 00:29:13,732
Gravimetric fields have returned
to normal.

579
00:29:13,776 --> 00:29:14,744
What happened?

580
00:29:14,778 --> 00:29:16,007
I'm not sure.

581
00:29:16,047 --> 00:29:18,176
The carrier wave shouldn't have
affected the wormhole at all.

582
00:29:18,218 --> 00:29:19,847
Was there any damage
to the relay?

583
00:29:19,888 --> 00:29:21,949
None. I'm still receiving
the test signal.

584
00:29:21,992 --> 00:29:23,586
Benjamin,
the gravitational surge

585
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:25,258
altered the course of the comet.

586
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,202
It's now heading directly
toward the wormhole.

587
00:29:27,236 --> 00:29:29,263
If the comet enters the wormhole

588
00:29:29,308 --> 00:29:32,839
the silithium in its core
will cause a cascade reaction.

589
00:29:32,881 --> 00:29:35,283
And collapse the wormhole
permanently.

590
00:29:43,769 --> 00:29:46,366
Commander's Log, supplemental.

591
00:29:46,408 --> 00:29:47,501
With less than five hours

592
00:29:47,544 --> 00:29:49,138
before the comet
reaches the wormhole

593
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,706
I've brought the <i>Defiant</i>
back to the station

594
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:54,086
and convened a meeting
of the entire science team.

595
00:29:54,123 --> 00:29:56,184
Apparently,
the carrier wave we sent

596
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:58,697
created some sort
of subspace inversion

597
00:29:58,733 --> 00:30:00,430
inside the wormhole.

598
00:30:00,536 --> 00:30:02,004
That's what caused
the gravity well to form.

599
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:03,064
The possibility

600
00:30:03,108 --> 00:30:05,408
of subspace inversion
was predicted in one

601
00:30:05,446 --> 00:30:06,436
of our computer models.

602
00:30:06,515 --> 00:30:08,849
Well, that wasn't included
in the data you sent us.

603
00:30:08,886 --> 00:30:10,879
The probability
of such an occurrence

604
00:30:10,923 --> 00:30:13,918
was less than two percent...
well within safety limits.

605
00:30:13,963 --> 00:30:17,026
We saw no reason to include it
in the data we sent you.

606
00:30:17,069 --> 00:30:19,335
It would seem that our
scientific methodologies

607
00:30:19,374 --> 00:30:20,433
differ slightly.

608
00:30:20,476 --> 00:30:22,776
It is our practice to examine
all possibilities

609
00:30:22,814 --> 00:30:25,786
no matter how unlikely, before
we proceed with field tests.

610
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:29,190
We would, of course, prefer
to operate that way, as well.

611
00:30:29,226 --> 00:30:31,321
However, since
the Science Ministry

612
00:30:31,365 --> 00:30:34,098
falls under the jurisdiction
of the military

613
00:30:34,136 --> 00:30:35,730
we have to follow certain rules.

614
00:30:35,773 --> 00:30:37,709
One of them is not
to make any project

615
00:30:37,744 --> 00:30:39,212
look unnecessarily dangerous.

616
00:30:39,246 --> 00:30:40,441
We'll keep that in mind

617
00:30:40,483 --> 00:30:43,011
when we resume work
on the communications relay.

618
00:30:43,054 --> 00:30:46,026
That is an extremely
unlikely possibility, Commander.

619
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,861
The Science Ministry
will undoubtedly wish

620
00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:52,532
to assemble a new team
before proceeding further.

621
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,876
That is, of course,
an internal Cardassian matter.

622
00:30:56,915 --> 00:30:58,544
Chief...

623
00:30:58,586 --> 00:31:00,419
Dax feels we can't risk

624
00:31:00,456 --> 00:31:02,892
using tractor beams
to deflect the comet.

625
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:04,327
It would probably
break into smaller pieces

626
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:05,730
and we'd have
a bigger mess on our hands.

627
00:31:05,767 --> 00:31:06,996
The same thing would happen

628
00:31:07,035 --> 00:31:09,232
if you tried to destroy it
with a phaser beam.

629
00:31:09,273 --> 00:31:10,707
Not necessarily.

630
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:13,043
I could modify
the <i>Defiant's</i> phaser array

631
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:16,315
to generate a beam wide enough
to encompass the entire comet.

632
00:31:16,354 --> 00:31:18,985
Vaporizing it evenly,
so it won't break up.

633
00:31:19,026 --> 00:31:20,757
How long would
the modifications take?

634
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:22,426
Three hours.

635
00:31:22,467 --> 00:31:24,061
Get on it.

636
00:31:24,103 --> 00:31:25,766
We'll be cutting this one
pretty close.

637
00:31:32,286 --> 00:31:35,156
I've accessed the <i>Defiant's</i>
primary phaser relay.

638
00:31:35,192 --> 00:31:38,062
I'm going to try shunting it
through the warp drive.

639
00:31:38,097 --> 00:31:40,226
Won't that overload the relay?

640
00:31:40,268 --> 00:31:42,204
Not if we bypass
the plasma emitter.

641
00:31:42,239 --> 00:31:44,767
I hadn't thought of that.

642
00:31:49,521 --> 00:31:52,425
The emitter coupling
is over there.

643
00:32:13,001 --> 00:32:14,664
What are you doing now?

644
00:32:14,704 --> 00:32:17,904
I'm decoupling the servos,
so they don't lock up.

645
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:29,958
You have very steady hands.

646
00:32:31,638 --> 00:32:35,008
Well they get the job done,
I guess.

647
00:32:35,045 --> 00:32:37,345
And right now,
the most important job

648
00:32:37,382 --> 00:32:40,320
is bypassing the plasma emitter.

649
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:50,172
I assure you, I'm quite fertile.

650
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,941
I could provide you
with many healthy children

651
00:32:53,983 --> 00:32:56,351
if that's your concern,
but, quite frankly

652
00:32:56,387 --> 00:32:58,653
I think you're getting
a little ahead of yourself.

653
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:00,558
Children?

654
00:33:00,596 --> 00:33:02,930
What are you talking about?

655
00:33:02,967 --> 00:33:04,869
I already have a child

656
00:33:04,904 --> 00:33:06,806
and a wife.

657
00:33:06,842 --> 00:33:09,278
You're married?

658
00:33:09,313 --> 00:33:10,747
Yes, happily!

659
00:33:10,783 --> 00:33:13,755
Then why have you been
leading me to believe

660
00:33:13,789 --> 00:33:15,087
that you wanted me?

661
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:16,890
I haven't.

662
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:20,891
All we've done
since we've met is argue.

663
00:33:20,936 --> 00:33:24,842
I took your overt irritability
toward me as a signal

664
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:28,909
that you wished to pursue
some physical relationship.

665
00:33:28,952 --> 00:33:31,013
Of course.

666
00:33:31,057 --> 00:33:35,658
Well, that's how Cardassians,
uh, do things?

667
00:33:35,733 --> 00:33:38,203
Oh, my.

668
00:33:38,237 --> 00:33:41,073
I'm afraid this is a case

669
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:44,948
of cross-cultural
misunderstanding.

670
00:33:44,984 --> 00:33:46,043
I think so.

671
00:33:46,087 --> 00:33:47,578
Oh.

672
00:33:47,623 --> 00:33:50,959
I'm not remotely
interested in you.

673
00:33:50,996 --> 00:33:53,900
Well, that's not what I meant.

674
00:33:53,936 --> 00:33:56,567
Look, you are very attractive

675
00:33:56,608 --> 00:33:58,168
and I'm flattered,
of course. But...

676
00:33:58,211 --> 00:33:59,201
Please, Mr. O'Brien

677
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:01,375
there's no need to continue.

678
00:34:01,417 --> 00:34:03,683
You've made your feelings clear.

679
00:34:07,262 --> 00:34:09,255
Gilora, we-we have
to finish this.

680
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:14,503
I'm sure you can complete
the job on your own.

681
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:25,460
Chief O'Brien
said the modification

682
00:34:25,498 --> 00:34:27,468
to the <i>Defiant's</i> phasers
would be ready

683
00:34:27,502 --> 00:34:29,301
within half an hour.

684
00:34:29,339 --> 00:34:31,936
Half an hour ahead
of schedule, hmm?

685
00:34:31,978 --> 00:34:33,709
The Chief's a born engineer.

686
00:34:33,782 --> 00:34:35,148
He always gives himself

687
00:34:35,185 --> 00:34:38,055
a comfortable margin
with his repair estimates.

688
00:34:42,265 --> 00:34:44,394
Let me guess.

689
00:34:44,436 --> 00:34:46,929
You're reading up
on Bajoran prophecies

690
00:34:46,975 --> 00:34:48,569
concerning the Emissary.

691
00:34:48,612 --> 00:34:50,673
There are hundreds of them.

692
00:34:50,716 --> 00:34:53,186
Most of them are vague,
some are contradictory.

693
00:34:53,221 --> 00:34:56,991
But just enough truth in
a few of them to make me wonder.

694
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:59,294
You mean some of them
have come true?

695
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:02,237
If you interpret them
in a certain way, yes.

696
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:05,267
So now you're wondering
if Trakor's prophecy

697
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:06,974
is going to come true, as well.

698
00:35:07,015 --> 00:35:09,646
I have to admit,
it's getting harder to ignore.

699
00:35:09,687 --> 00:35:10,882
But, Benjamin,
there's every reason

700
00:35:10,923 --> 00:35:13,554
to believe we'll be able
to destroy the comet.

701
00:35:13,594 --> 00:35:15,564
I know.

702
00:35:15,598 --> 00:35:17,659
But I'm becoming
more and more concerned

703
00:35:17,703 --> 00:35:19,832
that if I don't send
the Cardassians home

704
00:35:19,874 --> 00:35:21,605
something else will go wrong.

705
00:35:21,645 --> 00:35:25,881
And the "gates of heaven
will burn and be cast open."

706
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,413
Let me ask you something.

707
00:35:28,457 --> 00:35:30,427
If you never heard
Trakor's prophecy

708
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:31,724
what would you do?

709
00:35:31,765 --> 00:35:35,603
I'd continue working
on the communications relay.

710
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:40,308
Then it seems to me
you have a choice.

711
00:35:40,348 --> 00:35:43,115
You can either
make your own decisions

712
00:35:43,154 --> 00:35:46,924
or you can let these prophecies
make them for you.

713
00:35:58,284 --> 00:36:00,686
As soon as the <i>Defiant</i> is ready

714
00:36:00,723 --> 00:36:03,661
have the Cardassians
meet us on board.

715
00:36:03,695 --> 00:36:06,097
Yes, sir.

716
00:36:20,829 --> 00:36:21,990
The comet is directly ahead.

717
00:36:22,032 --> 00:36:23,091
Distance, 200 kilometers.

718
00:36:23,134 --> 00:36:25,001
Bring us to within
ten kilometers.

719
00:36:25,038 --> 00:36:28,477
Chief, are your phaser
modifications on line?

720
00:36:28,511 --> 00:36:29,638
Aye, sir.

721
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:31,478
Phasers are locked on target.

722
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,660
Holding position
at ten kilometers.

723
00:36:38,698 --> 00:36:39,825
Shields up.

724
00:36:39,901 --> 00:36:41,335
Go to Red Alert.

725
00:36:42,338 --> 00:36:43,328
Fire!

726
00:36:48,885 --> 00:36:50,445
Chief, what the hell happened?

727
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:52,588
I don't know, sir.

728
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:54,652
The entire weapons relay
just blew.

729
00:36:54,696 --> 00:36:56,495
All defensive systems are down.

730
00:36:56,533 --> 00:36:57,762
Benjamin, the sensors show

731
00:36:57,803 --> 00:36:59,864
that the modified phasers
never came on line.

732
00:36:59,974 --> 00:37:01,169
We fired a standard burst

733
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:03,703
and it shattered the comet
instead of vaporizing it.

734
00:37:03,748 --> 00:37:05,718
There's no way they should have
misfired like that.

735
00:37:05,752 --> 00:37:07,278
I modified the systems myself.

736
00:37:07,322 --> 00:37:09,383
Commander, the three fragments

737
00:37:09,426 --> 00:37:11,328
are still on course
for the wormhole.

738
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:13,299
How soon before
they reach the entrance?

739
00:37:13,334 --> 00:37:15,167
26 minutes.

740
00:37:16,373 --> 00:37:20,040
And without weapons,
we have no way of stopping them.

741
00:37:30,356 --> 00:37:33,260
The main emitter coupling
has been depolarized.

742
00:37:33,295 --> 00:37:35,892
I must have accidentally
inverted the power flow

743
00:37:35,934 --> 00:37:37,801
when I tried to modify
the phaser array.

744
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:39,671
I can't believe it.

745
00:37:39,708 --> 00:37:41,769
A first-year engineering student

746
00:37:41,813 --> 00:37:43,908
wouldn't make
a mistake like that.

747
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:46,216
This wasn't your fault,
Mr. O'Brien.

748
00:37:46,254 --> 00:37:47,848
And it wasn't an accident.

749
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:49,724
Gilora...

750
00:37:49,761 --> 00:37:51,924
Dejar is a member
of the Obsidian Order.

751
00:37:51,966 --> 00:37:54,699
She was assigned to our team
for security reasons.

752
00:37:54,738 --> 00:37:57,140
I believe
she sabotaged this coupling.

753
00:37:57,176 --> 00:37:59,169
The Order has always
been opposed

754
00:37:59,214 --> 00:38:01,116
to the peace treaty with Bajor.

755
00:38:01,151 --> 00:38:03,884
They sent you here
to sabotage the relay

756
00:38:03,923 --> 00:38:06,052
because
if the first joint venture

757
00:38:06,094 --> 00:38:08,691
between Cardassia and Bajor
was a failure

758
00:38:08,732 --> 00:38:10,599
it would probably be the last.

759
00:38:10,636 --> 00:38:13,004
This is all speculation,
Commander.

760
00:38:13,042 --> 00:38:14,271
You have no proof.

761
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:17,476
If it was sabotage, a DNA
scan on the coupling

762
00:38:17,517 --> 00:38:19,783
should reveal who's responsible.

763
00:38:19,822 --> 00:38:22,817
Take her to quarters
and detain her there.

764
00:38:24,932 --> 00:38:29,270
Now that the comet's been
fractured into smaller pieces

765
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,573
can we use the tractor
beams to deflect them?

766
00:38:31,611 --> 00:38:32,977
They'd just disintegrate further

767
00:38:33,015 --> 00:38:34,244
releasing more silithium.

768
00:38:34,284 --> 00:38:36,345
If we can't stop the fragments

769
00:38:36,388 --> 00:38:39,019
is there any way that we
can prevent the silithium

770
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,962
from interacting
with the wormhole?

771
00:38:40,997 --> 00:38:42,967
Maybe if we could
contain it somehow.

772
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:44,230
If you could generate

773
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:46,399
a subspace field
around the fragments

774
00:38:46,508 --> 00:38:48,410
that might contain
the silithium.

775
00:38:48,512 --> 00:38:49,844
The warp drive...

776
00:38:49,882 --> 00:38:52,877
it could create a subspace
bubble around the ship.

777
00:38:52,921 --> 00:38:54,412
But we'd have
to maneuver the <i>Defiant</i>

778
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:55,755
between the fragments.

779
00:38:55,793 --> 00:38:58,093
They're too close together.
There's not enough room.

780
00:38:58,132 --> 00:39:00,865
A shuttlepod could
maneuver between them.

781
00:39:00,904 --> 00:39:02,965
And its warp drive
should be able to create

782
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:04,374
a large enough subspace field.

783
00:39:04,477 --> 00:39:06,811
Maybe, but it could
overload the engines.

784
00:39:06,849 --> 00:39:09,046
That's the chance
I'll have to take.

785
00:39:09,087 --> 00:39:10,784
Major, you have the Bridge.

786
00:39:10,823 --> 00:39:14,524
I want you to take the <i>Defiant</i>
back into the Alpha Quadrant

787
00:39:14,564 --> 00:39:17,161
as soon as I've cleared
the shuttlebay.

788
00:39:17,203 --> 00:39:18,000
Commander.

789
00:39:20,409 --> 00:39:23,040
I want to go with you.

790
00:39:23,081 --> 00:39:25,780
Not just because I'm
your First Officer

791
00:39:25,819 --> 00:39:29,520
but because I believe
I'm here to help the Emissary.

792
00:39:31,298 --> 00:39:34,168
Dax, the Bridge is yours.

793
00:39:41,084 --> 00:39:43,077
We've cleared the shuttlebay.

794
00:39:43,121 --> 00:39:45,854
Signal the <i>Defiant</i>
that they can leave.

795
00:39:45,894 --> 00:39:48,194
They're heading
for the wormhole.

796
00:39:48,232 --> 00:39:51,831
I'm going to take us in
behind the comet fragments.

797
00:39:51,871 --> 00:39:54,866
It'll be easier to maneuver
into position.

798
00:40:11,444 --> 00:40:12,503
Hold position here.

799
00:40:12,546 --> 00:40:14,311
They could be in
for a rough ride.

800
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,343
Stand by transporters
in case we need

801
00:40:16,388 --> 00:40:19,758
to beam them off the shuttlepod
when they clear the wormhole.

802
00:40:19,794 --> 00:40:21,764
We're in position.

803
00:40:21,798 --> 00:40:24,929
Activate the subspace field.

804
00:40:24,972 --> 00:40:26,566
Field engaged.

805
00:40:30,616 --> 00:40:33,417
We'll reach the entrance
to the wormhole in...

806
00:40:33,455 --> 00:40:35,118
five seconds.

807
00:40:52,326 --> 00:40:54,523
The subspace field
is losing integrity.

808
00:40:54,564 --> 00:40:57,468
Some of the silithium
is starting to leak through.

809
00:40:57,503 --> 00:41:01,170
Divert power from the engines
to the subspace field coils.

810
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:04,547
We'll let our own inertia
carry us the rest of the way.

811
00:41:04,584 --> 00:41:05,552
That helped.

812
00:41:05,586 --> 00:41:07,249
We're still losing silithium.

813
00:41:08,759 --> 00:41:11,059
I'm picking up a neutrino surge.

814
00:41:11,097 --> 00:41:12,794
Something's coming through.

815
00:41:25,025 --> 00:41:26,186
Dax to Sisko.

816
00:41:26,227 --> 00:41:27,195
Sisko here.

817
00:41:27,229 --> 00:41:28,492
Are you all right, Benjamin?

818
00:41:28,532 --> 00:41:30,000
There was some silithium leakage

819
00:41:30,035 --> 00:41:31,698
inside the wormhole,
but we're fine.

820
00:41:33,508 --> 00:41:34,942
I don't believe it.

821
00:41:34,977 --> 00:41:36,468
What is it, Chief?

822
00:41:36,514 --> 00:41:39,247
I'm picking up the test signal
from the communications relay.

823
00:41:39,287 --> 00:41:40,916
How is that possible?

824
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:42,585
I'm not sure.

825
00:41:42,626 --> 00:41:44,186
We're reading
a subspace filament

826
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:45,893
leading back through
the wormhole.

827
00:41:45,933 --> 00:41:48,028
It's acting like some kind
of carrier wave.

828
00:41:48,071 --> 00:41:50,064
The comet fragments...

829
00:41:50,108 --> 00:41:53,274
they must have left a silithium
trail in the wormhole.

830
00:41:53,315 --> 00:41:57,187
It's almost like the wormhole
was wedged open just a crack...

831
00:41:57,223 --> 00:42:00,354
just enough to let
subspace signals through.

832
00:42:00,395 --> 00:42:03,162
The prophecy came true...

833
00:42:03,201 --> 00:42:05,764
all of it.

834
00:42:05,806 --> 00:42:11,215
We just misinterpreted
Trakor's words.

835
00:42:12,753 --> 00:42:14,814
The three vipers.

836
00:42:14,857 --> 00:42:18,318
He wasn't talking
about the Cardassians.

837
00:42:18,365 --> 00:42:21,998
He meant
the three comet fragments.

838
00:42:24,644 --> 00:42:26,511
The communications relay.

839
00:42:26,548 --> 00:42:28,575
In a sense, we've been trying

840
00:42:28,618 --> 00:42:31,020
to peer
through the temple gates.

841
00:42:31,057 --> 00:42:34,223
The silithium
ignited the wormhole

842
00:42:34,263 --> 00:42:36,665
burning the temple gates.

843
00:42:36,701 --> 00:42:38,671
So that they never close again.

844
00:42:38,738 --> 00:42:41,539
And it's all because
the Emissary...

845
00:42:43,982 --> 00:42:45,679
used the sword of stars.

846
00:42:45,752 --> 00:42:48,485
And Trakor saw it all...

847
00:42:48,525 --> 00:42:51,622
3,000 years ago.

848
00:43:02,353 --> 00:43:04,653
I just want to say
that I appreciate

849
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:06,785
what you did on the <i>Defiant.</i>

850
00:43:06,828 --> 00:43:08,661
I hope it doesn't cause
you too much trouble

851
00:43:08,765 --> 00:43:10,131
when you get back to Cardassia.

852
00:43:10,168 --> 00:43:13,767
My superiors in the Science
Ministry will protect me.

853
00:43:13,808 --> 00:43:17,008
Frankly, I think Dejar's
in much more trouble than I.

854
00:43:17,048 --> 00:43:19,679
The Order doesn't
reward failure.

855
00:43:19,754 --> 00:43:22,487
Still, it was
a brave thing to do.

856
00:43:22,526 --> 00:43:24,120
I didn't want you
to take the blame

857
00:43:24,163 --> 00:43:25,894
for something
that wasn't your fault.

858
00:43:25,932 --> 00:43:29,427
I know how proud you are
of your work.

859
00:43:29,473 --> 00:43:30,964
Too proud, sometimes.

860
00:43:31,009 --> 00:43:34,106
It's gotten me into trouble,
now and again.

861
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:36,552
What's your wife's name?

862
00:43:36,587 --> 00:43:38,386
Keiko.

863
00:43:38,425 --> 00:43:41,056
A lucky woman.

864
00:43:53,488 --> 00:43:56,483
Emissary, I'm sorry
I doubted you.

865
00:43:56,527 --> 00:43:59,499
I realize now I let
my distrust of the Cardassians

866
00:43:59,533 --> 00:44:02,130
blind me to the Prophets' words.

867
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:03,698
It seems that the Prophets
want peace

868
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:05,402
between your two peoples,
after all.

869
00:44:05,445 --> 00:44:07,574
Perhaps so.

870
00:44:07,616 --> 00:44:11,020
There are signs
that Trakor's Fourth Prophecy

871
00:44:11,056 --> 00:44:13,458
will soon come to pass, as well.

872
00:44:13,495 --> 00:44:15,624
Don't tell me that it has
something to do with me.

873
00:44:15,665 --> 00:44:16,963
You, Commander?

874
00:44:17,001 --> 00:44:20,167
Well, it is a prophecy
about the Emissary.

875
00:44:20,208 --> 00:44:21,734
Tell me about it.

876
00:44:21,844 --> 00:44:24,645
Trakor's Fourth Prophecy

877
00:44:24,683 --> 00:44:27,712
says that the Emissary
will face a fiery trial

878
00:44:27,756 --> 00:44:28,883
and he'll be forced to choose...
