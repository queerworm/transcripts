1
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,897
Captain's Log, Stardate 51145.3.

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:10,382
The <i>Defiant</i> has been operating
out of Starbase 375

3
00:00:10,417 --> 00:00:14,657
conducting forays
into Dominion controlled space.

4
00:00:14,695 --> 00:00:16,860
While the missions have taken
a toll on my people

5
00:00:16,901 --> 00:00:18,735
they remain determined to do

6
00:00:18,773 --> 00:00:20,938
whatever it takes
to win this war

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,244
as do I.

8
00:00:23,586 --> 00:00:24,919
Here you are.

9
00:00:24,957 --> 00:00:27,522
Where did you get your
hands on Saurian brandy?

10
00:00:27,565 --> 00:00:29,092
In the middle of a war, no less.

11
00:00:29,135 --> 00:00:30,935
It's a busy starbase.

12
00:00:30,974 --> 00:00:34,472
I may be a cadet,
but I'm still a Ferengi.

13
00:00:34,517 --> 00:00:35,816
Lucky for us.

14
00:00:45,147 --> 00:00:46,879
Excuse me, Captain.

15
00:00:46,918 --> 00:00:49,254
The power cell
from the phaser array.

16
00:00:49,292 --> 00:00:51,229
We used it up
on the last mission.

17
00:00:55,341 --> 00:00:58,805
Take a good look at this,
people.

18
00:00:58,852 --> 00:01:01,324
It says something
about this ship.

19
00:01:01,358 --> 00:01:03,762
It says that we will fight

20
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:07,936
and we will keep on fighting
until we can't fight anymore.

21
00:01:07,977 --> 00:01:09,607
Yes, sir.

22
00:01:09,648 --> 00:01:12,486
You don't just throw
something like this away.

23
00:01:12,523 --> 00:01:13,787
No, sir.

24
00:01:23,354 --> 00:01:24,790
Admiral on deck.

25
00:01:26,028 --> 00:01:27,498
As you were.

26
00:01:27,532 --> 00:01:28,626
Ben.

27
00:01:28,668 --> 00:01:30,104
Admiral.

28
00:01:30,139 --> 00:01:32,874
Um, let's, uh, take a walk.

29
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,015
What was going on in there?

30
00:01:37,058 --> 00:01:39,053
Just a little ritual
we fell into.

31
00:01:39,097 --> 00:01:40,863
It kind of helps
the crew unwind.

32
00:01:40,902 --> 00:01:42,098
Well, they deserve it.

33
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,473
They did a hell of a job.

34
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,774
Thank you, sir.

35
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,412
But you didn't come here
to tell me that, did you?

36
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:50,729
No, I didn't.

37
00:01:50,763 --> 00:01:53,396
Ever since this war began,
the Dominion's been able

38
00:01:53,504 --> 00:01:55,202
to outmaneuver us at every turn.

39
00:01:55,243 --> 00:01:56,610
Wherever we send our ships

40
00:01:56,647 --> 00:01:58,676
they seem to be there
waiting for us.

41
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,745
I've noticed that.

42
00:01:59,788 --> 00:02:01,349
It was enough to make you think

43
00:02:01,393 --> 00:02:03,296
that they were
smarter than we are.

44
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:04,825
But they're not.

45
00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:07,741
They just had an edge that we
didn't know anything about...

46
00:02:07,778 --> 00:02:08,906
until yesterday.

47
00:02:08,948 --> 00:02:10,212
Starfleet Intelligence

48
00:02:10,251 --> 00:02:12,485
has located
a massive sensor array

49
00:02:12,524 --> 00:02:14,792
hidden on the periphery
of the Argolis Cluster.

50
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,026
The damn thing's capable

51
00:02:16,067 --> 00:02:18,335
of monitoring ship movements
over five sectors.

52
00:02:18,374 --> 00:02:21,747
That's how they managed
to stay one step ahead of us.

53
00:02:21,784 --> 00:02:24,758
They've had an enormous
tactical advantage.

54
00:02:24,792 --> 00:02:26,855
I want you
to take it away from them.

55
00:02:26,898 --> 00:02:27,924
Gladly, sir.

56
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,937
It won't be easy.

57
00:02:28,971 --> 00:02:30,441
The array is heavily defended.

58
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:34,074
This is the intelligence report.

59
00:02:34,118 --> 00:02:35,451
Look it over.

60
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:38,461
I want an attack plan
on my desk by 0800.

61
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,502
You'll have it.

62
00:02:51,868 --> 00:02:53,098
There he is.

63
00:02:53,138 --> 00:02:55,269
Damar's a creature
of habit, all right.

64
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:59,846
After a hard day at work,
he deserves his glass of <i>kanar.</i>

65
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,457
"Why are the Jem'Hadar
always in here?"

66
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:05,162
He asks himself.

67
00:03:05,205 --> 00:03:07,439
They don't drink.
They don't eat.

68
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:08,469
They don't gamble.

69
00:03:08,581 --> 00:03:10,381
All they do is take up space.

70
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:11,980
Damar asks his bartender

71
00:03:12,024 --> 00:03:15,363
if he found a padd
he was working on the other day.

72
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,166
My brother tells the truth.

73
00:03:17,205 --> 00:03:18,299
He hasn't seen it.

74
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:20,336
Damar doesn't like that.

75
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,044
The padd contained a draft copy

76
00:03:22,085 --> 00:03:24,216
of a secret memorandum
he was working on

77
00:03:24,258 --> 00:03:26,024
concerning the shortage
of white.

78
00:03:26,063 --> 00:03:28,365
In it, he speculates
that, without the drug

79
00:03:28,402 --> 00:03:30,236
the Jem'Hadar will run amok

80
00:03:30,275 --> 00:03:32,747
killing everyone
and everything in their path.

81
00:03:32,781 --> 00:03:34,946
Damar recommends
that if the Cardassians

82
00:03:34,988 --> 00:03:36,686
can't bring down the minefield

83
00:03:36,726 --> 00:03:39,564
and reopen the supply-line
from the Gamma Quadrant

84
00:03:39,635 --> 00:03:43,042
they should poison
the last ration of white

85
00:03:43,077 --> 00:03:46,416
eliminating the Jem'Hadar
before it's too late.

86
00:03:46,453 --> 00:03:49,256
How did you get ahold
of Damar's padd anyway?

87
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:51,767
I'm good with my hands.

88
00:03:52,904 --> 00:03:53,895
Here we go.

89
00:03:55,813 --> 00:03:57,146
They've seen him.

90
00:03:57,183 --> 00:03:59,621
Damar.

91
00:03:59,724 --> 00:04:01,923
The missing padd.

92
00:04:02,765 --> 00:04:04,064
Where'd you find that?

93
00:04:04,103 --> 00:04:07,134
Damar accuses them
of stealing it.

94
00:04:07,178 --> 00:04:09,115
But they say they found it
outside their quarters...

95
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,486
right where I left it.

96
00:04:11,523 --> 00:04:14,395
...have you and your whole race
thrown off of this station!

97
00:04:14,431 --> 00:04:16,299
I knew this was going to work.

98
00:04:16,337 --> 00:04:18,605
The Cardassians
and the Jem'Hadar

99
00:04:18,677 --> 00:04:20,774
can pretend to be allies...

100
00:04:20,816 --> 00:04:22,115
but they hate each other.

101
00:04:22,153 --> 00:04:23,383
Get out of my way!

102
00:04:24,326 --> 00:04:25,192
Ow.

103
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:42,407
When I confronted them,
they attacked me.

104
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:44,317
I don't care what they did.

105
00:06:44,355 --> 00:06:45,381
You should never have let

106
00:06:45,424 --> 00:06:47,054
this situation
get out of hand.

107
00:06:47,095 --> 00:06:48,257
Get out!

108
00:06:57,157 --> 00:07:01,534
How could Damar be
so stupid as to leave

109
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:04,703
such an inflammatory document
lying around for anyone to find?

110
00:07:04,744 --> 00:07:06,612
Your men stole it from him.

111
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,846
Jem'Hadar are not thieves.

112
00:07:07,887 --> 00:07:09,186
And Damar is not a liar.

113
00:07:09,224 --> 00:07:11,196
Keep your voice down.

114
00:07:14,304 --> 00:07:21,485
Our men need to see
that we're still allies.

115
00:07:22,494 --> 00:07:23,690
Smile.

116
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,639
Dukat.

117
00:07:26,673 --> 00:07:27,972
I'm smiling.

118
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,448
Gentlemen, I suggest
we get everyone out of here

119
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:31,509
as soon as possible.

120
00:07:31,553 --> 00:07:32,544
Odo's right.

121
00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:34,925
Tell your men they're
confined to quarters

122
00:07:34,962 --> 00:07:36,626
pending disciplinary hearings.

123
00:07:36,668 --> 00:07:38,434
I'll do the same.

124
00:07:38,472 --> 00:07:40,136
And keep smiling.

125
00:07:53,748 --> 00:07:54,910
Come.

126
00:08:04,077 --> 00:08:05,341
According to Intelligence

127
00:08:05,381 --> 00:08:07,717
the array is capable
of detecting cloaked ships

128
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:09,622
as far as two light years away.

129
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,566
By the time the <i>Defiant</i>
goes around the Argolis Cluster

130
00:08:12,601 --> 00:08:14,800
the Dominion will already know
we're coming.

131
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,640
You'll have a dozen
Jem'Hadar ships on you

132
00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:18,012
before you can even get close.

133
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,352
That's why we need the element
of surprise on our side.

134
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:21,358
It's the only way.

135
00:08:21,392 --> 00:08:23,056
What are you suggesting?

136
00:08:23,164 --> 00:08:26,002
That I take the <i>Defiant</i>
through the Argolis.

137
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:27,736
You can't get a ship
through there.

138
00:08:27,776 --> 00:08:30,750
You'd be cut to pieces
by the gravimetric shear.

139
00:08:30,785 --> 00:08:32,950
That's exactly
what the Dominion thinks.

140
00:08:32,991 --> 00:08:35,088
But if we come at them
from the Argolis

141
00:08:35,198 --> 00:08:36,793
they won't know what hit them.

142
00:08:36,836 --> 00:08:39,104
What makes you think
you can get through?

143
00:08:39,175 --> 00:08:40,439
Dax says she can navigate

144
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,211
around the gravimetric
distortions.

145
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,914
She's studied
protostar clusters.

146
00:08:43,955 --> 00:08:45,391
She knows what to look for.

147
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:47,831
It's a gamble

148
00:08:47,866 --> 00:08:49,530
but it's one
I'm willing to take.

149
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,508
All right.

150
00:08:53,682 --> 00:08:54,912
Let's give it a shot.

151
00:08:56,524 --> 00:08:57,857
When can you leave?

152
00:08:57,894 --> 00:09:00,493
As soon as we finish repairs
on the <i>Defiant.</i>

153
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:03,803
Keep me posted, Captain.

154
00:09:20,524 --> 00:09:23,590
You wanted to see me.

155
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,337
Well?

156
00:09:26,374 --> 00:09:28,939
Don't you have
something to say to me?

157
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:30,747
About what happened at Quark's?

158
00:09:30,786 --> 00:09:31,846
Yeah.

159
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:33,724
It worked better
than I expected.

160
00:09:33,761 --> 00:09:35,960
I knew you were behind it!

161
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:37,334
Of course you did.

162
00:09:37,371 --> 00:09:40,072
We discussed it
at our last resistance meeting.

163
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:42,711
And I said it was a bad idea.

164
00:09:42,753 --> 00:09:44,417
Yes, you did.

165
00:09:44,457 --> 00:09:46,325
And then you walked
out of the room

166
00:09:46,363 --> 00:09:48,231
like there was nothing
left to say.

167
00:09:48,302 --> 00:09:49,863
But Rom and Jake stayed

168
00:09:49,906 --> 00:09:52,539
and we discussed it,
and you know what?

169
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,609
I decided it was a good idea.

170
00:09:54,652 --> 00:09:57,683
So you went ahead
and did it behind my back?

171
00:09:57,728 --> 00:10:00,258
Why are you taking this
so personally?

172
00:10:00,302 --> 00:10:02,068
How do you expect me to take it?

173
00:10:02,107 --> 00:10:05,480
I spend my days sitting on the
Council with Dukat and Weyoun

174
00:10:05,516 --> 00:10:07,954
doing whatever I can
to make sure that Bajor

175
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,623
survives this war intact.

176
00:10:10,664 --> 00:10:12,031
The last thing I need

177
00:10:12,068 --> 00:10:15,042
is to have you running around
causing mayhem.

178
00:10:15,076 --> 00:10:17,709
Do you have any idea
what Dukat would do

179
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:19,449
if he found out
you were behind it?!

180
00:10:19,489 --> 00:10:21,426
It's all the excuse
he would need

181
00:10:21,461 --> 00:10:23,831
to throw every Bajoran
off this station.

182
00:10:23,868 --> 00:10:27,241
The Federation
is losing this war.

183
00:10:27,277 --> 00:10:29,842
We can't sit by and do nothing.

184
00:10:29,885 --> 00:10:32,951
There are limits
to what we can do.

185
00:10:32,993 --> 00:10:34,087
I'm beginning to think

186
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:36,192
you shouldn't have agreed to sit
on that Council.

187
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,264
It's as if you're so invested

188
00:10:38,308 --> 00:10:40,280
in making sure
the station runs smoothly

189
00:10:40,313 --> 00:10:42,011
you've forgotten
there's a war going on.

190
00:10:42,052 --> 00:10:44,524
Are you questioning
my loyalties, Major?

191
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:46,154
I need you, Odo.

192
00:10:46,197 --> 00:10:49,228
The resistance needs you.

193
00:10:51,277 --> 00:10:52,644
Answer me.

194
00:10:52,682 --> 00:10:55,383
Are you questioning
my loyalties?

195
00:10:55,423 --> 00:10:56,950
Oh, of course not.

196
00:10:56,993 --> 00:10:58,520
That's not what this is about...

197
00:11:03,077 --> 00:11:05,072
Hello, Odo.

198
00:11:05,116 --> 00:11:07,315
It's good to see you again.

199
00:11:12,961 --> 00:11:13,930
Leave us.

200
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,594
I need to speak with Odo.

201
00:11:15,636 --> 00:11:16,798
Do you?

202
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:20,447
It's all right, Nerys.

203
00:11:20,483 --> 00:11:22,955
I may as well hear
what she has to say.

204
00:11:22,989 --> 00:11:24,322
Are you sure?

205
00:11:32,884 --> 00:11:35,118
You called her "Nerys."

206
00:11:35,157 --> 00:11:36,285
What of it?

207
00:11:36,327 --> 00:11:39,928
Well, you used
to call her "Major."

208
00:11:39,971 --> 00:11:42,911
Using the name of a solid
denotes intimacy.

209
00:11:42,945 --> 00:11:46,512
You're a long way from home.

210
00:11:48,261 --> 00:11:50,733
Here to keep an eye
on the war effort?

211
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:54,733
I'm content to leave the details
of the war to the Vorta.

212
00:11:54,778 --> 00:11:58,516
Then what brings you
to Deep Space 9?

213
00:11:58,556 --> 00:12:00,254
You.

214
00:12:01,665 --> 00:12:04,503
I was trapped
in the Alpha Quadrant

215
00:12:04,606 --> 00:12:09,142
when Captain Sisko mined
the entrance to the wormhole.

216
00:12:09,185 --> 00:12:12,456
I have spent too much time
with solids.

217
00:12:12,494 --> 00:12:17,236
I came because I felt the need
to be with one of my own.

218
00:12:17,275 --> 00:12:18,505
Ah.

219
00:12:18,545 --> 00:12:20,015
Well, that's ironic

220
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:24,494
considering what happened
the last time we crossed paths.

221
00:12:24,528 --> 00:12:27,400
You caused the death
of a fellow changeling, Odo.

222
00:12:27,436 --> 00:12:30,274
Turning you into a solid

223
00:12:30,311 --> 00:12:33,912
was the only punishment
severe enough for your crime.

224
00:12:33,955 --> 00:12:36,154
And now
that I'm a changeling again

225
00:12:36,194 --> 00:12:39,134
you come here
as though nothing ever happened?

226
00:12:39,169 --> 00:12:41,471
We have forgiven you.

227
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:44,780
Well, I haven't forgiven you.

228
00:12:44,818 --> 00:12:49,890
It is time to put
the past behind us, Odo.

229
00:12:49,932 --> 00:12:51,630
And what about the present?

230
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:54,108
You're waging a war
against my home.

231
00:12:54,144 --> 00:12:56,081
This is not your home.

232
00:12:56,116 --> 00:12:58,783
You belong with your own kind

233
00:12:58,824 --> 00:13:00,796
as part of the Great Link.

234
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:03,463
I'm quite content here,
thank you.

235
00:13:03,504 --> 00:13:06,034
You say that
because you don't know

236
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:08,710
what you're capable of becoming.

237
00:13:08,752 --> 00:13:12,490
Perhaps if we spent
some time together

238
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:15,503
you might begin to understand.

239
00:13:34,256 --> 00:13:36,228
Admiral, you wanted to see me?

240
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,034
I just got word.

241
00:13:40,072 --> 00:13:42,671
Captain Bennet's promotion
has come through.

242
00:13:42,713 --> 00:13:43,807
At my recommendation

243
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,650
Starfleet's putting
her in charge

244
00:13:45,689 --> 00:13:47,091
of Seventh Tactical Wing.

245
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,655
She was one of the best
adjutants I've ever had...

246
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,067
a strong grasp of strategy

247
00:13:51,103 --> 00:13:52,971
and ability to see
the big picture.

248
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:54,741
Sounds like it's
not going to be easy

249
00:13:54,814 --> 00:13:56,751
to find someone
to take her place.

250
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,521
I already have... you.

251
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,360
Sir?

252
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:05,308
I've been very impressed with
you over these past few weeks.

253
00:14:05,343 --> 00:14:07,007
I think we would
make a good team.

254
00:14:07,048 --> 00:14:09,043
Thank you, sir.

255
00:14:09,087 --> 00:14:11,617
Your new assignment
is effective immediately.

256
00:14:11,661 --> 00:14:13,495
Immediately, sir?

257
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:15,505
What about the Argolis mission?

258
00:14:15,538 --> 00:14:17,840
Commander Dax will
captain the <i>Defiant.</i>

259
00:14:19,951 --> 00:14:21,546
She is up to it, isn't she?

260
00:14:21,588 --> 00:14:23,560
Oh, absolutely, sir.

261
00:14:23,594 --> 00:14:27,469
I guess I'd just
gotten used to the idea

262
00:14:27,505 --> 00:14:30,708
of commanding
the mission myself.

263
00:14:30,748 --> 00:14:33,152
Look over
these tactical reports.

264
00:14:33,188 --> 00:14:36,527
I want your thoughts
on the Bolian operation.

265
00:14:36,564 --> 00:14:38,536
We'll meet here at 0600.

266
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:41,537
Ben...

267
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:46,815
congratulations.

268
00:14:55,683 --> 00:14:59,216
Legate Krim will be arriving
in the morning.

269
00:14:59,261 --> 00:15:03,501
I'll have a security detail
escort him to your office.

270
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:05,773
Well, if that's all...

271
00:15:13,901 --> 00:15:18,038
Founder, you honor us
with your presence.

272
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,314
I understand the war
is going well.

273
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:22,290
Only because
I've followed the plan

274
00:15:22,325 --> 00:15:23,852
the Founders laid out for me.

275
00:15:23,963 --> 00:15:25,627
Welcome to Terok Nor.

276
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:29,542
I'm glad we're finally
getting a chance to meet.

277
00:15:29,578 --> 00:15:31,880
As leaders
of our respective worlds

278
00:15:31,986 --> 00:15:34,117
you and I will be
taking our people

279
00:15:34,158 --> 00:15:36,859
into a future
that I'm quite confidant...

280
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:38,426
What about the minefield?

281
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,442
Why hasn't it been deactivated?

282
00:15:40,476 --> 00:15:42,242
Yes, Dukat.

283
00:15:42,281 --> 00:15:45,221
This delay is intolerable.

284
00:15:45,255 --> 00:15:46,725
There are thousands
of Jem'Hadar ships

285
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,162
stranded on the other
side of the wormhole

286
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:50,500
waiting to come through
and join the war effort.

287
00:15:50,537 --> 00:15:54,344
Maybe you haven't read
the latest reports

288
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:56,683
but even without those ships

289
00:15:56,721 --> 00:15:59,320
I'm still winning this war.

290
00:15:59,362 --> 00:16:00,923
You're winning?

291
00:16:00,967 --> 00:16:02,801
I assure you,
I'm intimately involved

292
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:04,308
in all military decisions.

293
00:16:04,343 --> 00:16:06,713
See to it
the minefield is brought down.

294
00:16:06,749 --> 00:16:08,379
Of course.

295
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:12,295
We've imposed our presence
on you long enough.

296
00:16:14,905 --> 00:16:19,042
If there's anything you need
while you're here

297
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,986
please, let me know.

298
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,446
Do they always compete
with one another like that?

299
00:16:31,484 --> 00:16:33,888
As a matter of fact, they do.

300
00:16:33,925 --> 00:16:36,956
You have to interact
with them often.

301
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,199
It must be trying for you.

302
00:16:39,239 --> 00:16:41,302
It hasn't been easy.

303
00:16:41,346 --> 00:16:43,283
Now, if you'll excuse me

304
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:46,121
I have some work
to do in my quarters.

305
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:48,096
May I walk with you?

306
00:17:02,186 --> 00:17:05,753
To become a thing
is to know a thing.

307
00:17:05,796 --> 00:17:07,562
To assume its form

308
00:17:07,601 --> 00:17:11,510
is to begin to understand
its existence.

309
00:17:11,545 --> 00:17:15,352
You tried to teach me that
when I visited our homeworld.

310
00:17:15,389 --> 00:17:16,688
Hmm...

311
00:17:16,727 --> 00:17:18,026
I remember.

312
00:17:18,064 --> 00:17:19,864
I didn't understand

313
00:17:19,902 --> 00:17:21,839
what you meant by it at first.

314
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,173
So when I returned
to the station

315
00:17:23,211 --> 00:17:25,912
I got rid of all the furniture
I used to have in my quarters

316
00:17:25,952 --> 00:17:29,325
and replaced it
with these objects.

317
00:17:29,361 --> 00:17:33,134
I've assumed every shape
in this room.

318
00:17:34,777 --> 00:17:37,011
I suppose
if it weren't for you

319
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,922
I never would have known
the simple pleasure

320
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:43,765
of spending time existing
as a stone or a branch.

321
00:17:43,835 --> 00:17:46,775
I'm glad you learned
something from your visit.

322
00:17:47,847 --> 00:17:51,289
Your arrival was a time
of great joy for the Link

323
00:17:51,323 --> 00:17:55,734
and your departure,
a time of great sadness.

324
00:17:55,769 --> 00:17:58,800
If only you had stayed
with us, Odo...

325
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:01,282
I couldn't.

326
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:05,456
You chose the solids.

327
00:18:05,496 --> 00:18:07,695
And I haven't regretted it.

328
00:18:09,207 --> 00:18:10,939
Not even a little?

329
00:18:13,184 --> 00:18:17,390
I do think about the Link
from time to time.

330
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,298
It's there for you.

331
00:18:20,973 --> 00:18:22,203
I can't.

332
00:18:22,243 --> 00:18:23,804
Why?

333
00:18:23,881 --> 00:18:26,514
Because of Kira?

334
00:18:28,962 --> 00:18:31,936
You still have feelings
for her, don't you?

335
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,907
But she doesn't share them.

336
00:18:35,413 --> 00:18:37,385
I'm sorry.

337
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:39,322
Aren't you going to tell me

338
00:18:39,357 --> 00:18:42,126
I shouldn't waste my time
with a solid?

339
00:18:42,165 --> 00:18:44,934
You love her.

340
00:18:48,082 --> 00:18:49,552
And I wish I didn't.

341
00:18:52,293 --> 00:18:54,322
I'm so vulnerable to her.

342
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:56,896
All she has to do is smile at me

343
00:18:56,974 --> 00:18:59,208
and I'm happy beyond reason.

344
00:18:59,246 --> 00:19:01,718
A minor disagreement between us

345
00:19:01,753 --> 00:19:03,314
and I'm devastated.

346
00:19:03,358 --> 00:19:04,657
It's absurd.

347
00:19:04,695 --> 00:19:08,661
Sometimes, I wish I could
reach inside myself

348
00:19:08,706 --> 00:19:11,680
and tear out
my feelings for her.

349
00:19:11,714 --> 00:19:13,116
But I can't.

350
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,816
Poor Odo.

351
00:19:14,857 --> 00:19:18,060
I don't want your pity.

352
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:21,302
I am not offering pity.

353
00:19:21,342 --> 00:19:24,806
What I need is some peace.

354
00:19:24,851 --> 00:19:28,384
What you need is clarity.

355
00:19:34,244 --> 00:19:36,843
I can give you that.

356
00:19:51,726 --> 00:19:53,789
Do you want me to stop?

357
00:20:20,774 --> 00:20:22,438
That'll be all.

358
00:20:26,022 --> 00:20:28,017
What are you doing here, Damar?

359
00:20:28,062 --> 00:20:30,763
Did Dukat demote you
to security detail?

360
00:20:30,802 --> 00:20:32,739
What can I do for you, Major?

361
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:34,107
I'm looking for Odo.

362
00:20:36,017 --> 00:20:37,989
Well, he's not here.

363
00:20:38,022 --> 00:20:40,460
Do you know where he is?

364
00:20:40,496 --> 00:20:42,433
Yes.

365
00:20:42,468 --> 00:20:43,767
That's good.

366
00:20:43,805 --> 00:20:46,107
It's good to know
where your boss is.

367
00:20:48,251 --> 00:20:50,154
He's in his quarters

368
00:20:50,256 --> 00:20:52,159
with the other shape-shifter.

369
00:20:52,262 --> 00:20:54,666
Jealous, Major?

370
00:20:54,702 --> 00:20:57,335
Try to stay out of trouble,
Damar.

371
00:20:57,376 --> 00:21:00,874
You don't want to end up
on sanitation duty.

372
00:21:08,574 --> 00:21:10,238
Come in.

373
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,583
Odo?

374
00:21:17,934 --> 00:21:19,427
Nerys.

375
00:21:19,472 --> 00:21:20,736
I dropped by your office

376
00:21:20,775 --> 00:21:23,077
and Damar told me
you were here with her.

377
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,610
She was here,
but she's gone now.

378
00:21:25,655 --> 00:21:27,353
You all right?

379
00:21:27,394 --> 00:21:29,126
What did she want?

380
00:21:29,165 --> 00:21:32,139
She didn't want anything.

381
00:21:32,174 --> 00:21:34,612
Then what was she doing here?

382
00:21:36,653 --> 00:21:39,822
I know how you feel
about her, Major

383
00:21:39,862 --> 00:21:43,235
but there's no reason
to be concerned.

384
00:21:43,305 --> 00:21:47,613
You don't know how much
I wish I could believe that.

385
00:21:47,651 --> 00:21:50,021
You didn't link
with her, did you?

386
00:21:53,467 --> 00:21:55,598
Actually, I did.

387
00:21:55,639 --> 00:21:57,132
You did?

388
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,348
What were you thinking?

389
00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:06,926
She didn't find out
about the resistance

390
00:22:06,971 --> 00:22:08,805
if that's why you're worried.

391
00:22:08,843 --> 00:22:09,709
It's not.

392
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,719
The Link isn't about

393
00:22:12,754 --> 00:22:14,588
exchanging information.

394
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:18,262
It's about merging thought
and form, idea and sensation.

395
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:21,676
That sounds like a perfect way
to manipulate someone.

396
00:22:21,712 --> 00:22:24,515
She's not manipulating me.

397
00:22:24,554 --> 00:22:28,862
Ever since the day
you two crossed paths

398
00:22:28,899 --> 00:22:31,965
she has lied to you, tricked you

399
00:22:32,007 --> 00:22:34,309
stood in judgment of you.

400
00:22:34,415 --> 00:22:35,885
I don't trust her.

401
00:22:35,918 --> 00:22:37,890
I don't understand how you can.

402
00:22:37,924 --> 00:22:40,796
I linked with her.

403
00:22:40,832 --> 00:22:42,598
If she had any hidden motive

404
00:22:42,637 --> 00:22:44,164
I would have sensed it.

405
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:47,080
She's just trying
to teach me about myself...

406
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:49,350
about what I'm capable
of becoming.

407
00:22:49,457 --> 00:22:51,360
An intergalactic warlord, maybe?

408
00:22:51,395 --> 00:22:53,025
Because that's what she is.

409
00:22:53,066 --> 00:22:54,468
Who knows?

410
00:22:54,504 --> 00:22:55,871
By linking with her

411
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:58,243
I might be able
to make her understand

412
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,813
that the Federation doesn't
pose a threat to her people.

413
00:23:01,858 --> 00:23:07,170
You believe you can convince her
to call off the war?

414
00:23:07,205 --> 00:23:10,669
If you could
experience the Link

415
00:23:10,716 --> 00:23:15,058
you'd understand the effect
it has on my people.

416
00:23:15,095 --> 00:23:17,898
You'd realize
that anything is possible.

417
00:23:17,936 --> 00:23:22,905
I'm only beginning
to understand it all, myself.

418
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,511
I still have so many questions.

419
00:23:24,555 --> 00:23:28,396
Now that she's here, I have
a chance to find some answers.

420
00:23:28,499 --> 00:23:30,265
Odo, this isn't the time

421
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:33,039
to go off on some kind
of personal quest.

422
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,073
There's too much at stake.

423
00:23:35,118 --> 00:23:40,430
After the war is over,
do whatever you need to do.

424
00:23:40,499 --> 00:23:43,166
If you feel you need to go
and join the Great Link

425
00:23:43,206 --> 00:23:45,109
I'm...
I'm not going to stop you.

426
00:23:45,146 --> 00:23:47,779
But for right now

427
00:23:47,819 --> 00:23:50,452
I need you here... focused.

428
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,824
Please promise me

429
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:54,838
that you're not going
to link with her again.

430
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:58,877
Not until this is over.

431
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:03,086
All right.

432
00:24:03,129 --> 00:24:04,359
I won't.

433
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:06,633
Now, if you'll excuse me

434
00:24:06,672 --> 00:24:08,438
I have to get to work.

435
00:24:08,477 --> 00:24:12,420
I'll see you
at the resistance meeting.

436
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,192
Are you two ever
going to be finished?

437
00:24:41,232 --> 00:24:43,865
Just a few more minutes,
Commander.

438
00:24:43,907 --> 00:24:45,309
That's "Captain."

439
00:24:45,411 --> 00:24:46,847
It's an old naval tradition.

440
00:24:46,882 --> 00:24:49,856
Whoever's in command of a ship,
regardless of rank

441
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,885
is referred to as "Captain."

442
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:54,425
You mean, if I
had to take command

443
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,840
I would be called
"Captain," too?

444
00:24:56,877 --> 00:24:59,349
Cadet, by the time
you took command

445
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:02,687
there'd be nobody left
to call you anything.

446
00:25:02,726 --> 00:25:04,093
Good point.

447
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:13,317
Come to take a last look around?

448
00:25:13,423 --> 00:25:15,418
Not a last look, I hope.

449
00:25:15,462 --> 00:25:17,730
How are the repairs coming?

450
00:25:17,768 --> 00:25:19,238
Almost done.

451
00:25:19,273 --> 00:25:22,304
I wouldn't get too comfortable
in that chair, old man.

452
00:25:22,347 --> 00:25:25,344
When this war is over,
I'm going to want my ship back.

453
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:29,457
Fine. When this war's over,
I'm going on a honeymoon.

454
00:25:29,501 --> 00:25:30,731
All done here, Captain.

455
00:25:30,771 --> 00:25:32,469
- Very well.
- All right.

456
00:25:35,986 --> 00:25:38,356
Plot a course
for the Argolis Cluster

457
00:25:38,392 --> 00:25:40,124
and prepare for departure.

458
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:41,428
Aye, Captain.

459
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:46,407
Benjamin...

460
00:25:46,516 --> 00:25:49,650
I wish you were coming with us.

461
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,685
You'll do fine.

462
00:26:16,031 --> 00:26:18,333
Pardon our appearance.

463
00:26:18,371 --> 00:26:20,035
We're renovating.

464
00:26:21,045 --> 00:26:22,538
<i>Kanar.</i>

465
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:28,031
Not that one.

466
00:26:28,064 --> 00:26:29,466
The '27.

467
00:26:29,569 --> 00:26:31,233
'27?

468
00:26:33,413 --> 00:26:35,043
Expensive.

469
00:26:35,084 --> 00:26:37,056
I can afford it...

470
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:39,062
on a Gul's salary.

471
00:26:39,095 --> 00:26:40,497
Wait a minute.

472
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,195
You started a fight in my bar

473
00:26:42,238 --> 00:26:44,233
and now you're
getting a promotion?

474
00:26:44,277 --> 00:26:46,511
What kind of way is that
to run an army?

475
00:26:46,617 --> 00:26:48,748
Dukat wasn't happy
about what happened.

476
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:51,423
I had to find a way
to make it up to him.

477
00:26:51,463 --> 00:26:53,526
I hope it was something big.

478
00:26:53,569 --> 00:26:56,543
Let's just say...

479
00:26:56,578 --> 00:26:59,279
it will change
the course of history.

480
00:27:00,589 --> 00:27:02,561
As a businessman

481
00:27:02,594 --> 00:27:06,092
I'm very interested
in the course of history.

482
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,842
This one's on me.

483
00:27:09,882 --> 00:27:13,985
Well, that's very kind
of you, Quark...

484
00:27:19,642 --> 00:27:21,705
but I can't talk about it.

485
00:27:23,253 --> 00:27:24,951
Of course.

486
00:27:24,991 --> 00:27:26,552
I understand.

487
00:27:26,662 --> 00:27:28,657
Here.
Let me pour you another.

488
00:27:44,111 --> 00:27:45,513
There's obviously
a lot of bad blood

489
00:27:45,548 --> 00:27:47,611
between the Cardassians
and the Jem'Hadar.

490
00:27:47,721 --> 00:27:49,020
It wouldn't take much

491
00:27:49,058 --> 00:27:51,030
to get them to go
at each other again.

492
00:27:51,064 --> 00:27:53,036
Yeah, I'm not sure
we want to do that.

493
00:27:53,069 --> 00:27:54,231
But it worked so well.

494
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:56,369
What do you think, Odo?

495
00:27:58,684 --> 00:28:01,385
I'm not sure it's a good idea.

496
00:28:01,425 --> 00:28:02,655
Then we'll do something else.

497
00:28:02,695 --> 00:28:03,492
Major...

498
00:28:03,532 --> 00:28:04,501
Something

499
00:28:04,535 --> 00:28:05,561
that we can all agree on.

500
00:28:07,676 --> 00:28:10,148
Who could that be?

501
00:28:10,184 --> 00:28:12,052
We're just sitting here

502
00:28:12,088 --> 00:28:14,583
enjoying each other's company.

503
00:28:14,629 --> 00:28:16,429
Right.

504
00:28:16,467 --> 00:28:17,595
Come in.

505
00:28:19,743 --> 00:28:21,213
Brother...

506
00:28:21,248 --> 00:28:23,652
are you all right?

507
00:28:23,754 --> 00:28:26,660
No, I am not all right.

508
00:28:26,763 --> 00:28:31,573
I just shared a bottle
of <i>kanar</i> with Damar.

509
00:28:33,616 --> 00:28:35,211
That rhymes.

510
00:28:36,825 --> 00:28:38,523
You're drunk.

511
00:28:38,563 --> 00:28:41,264
Of course I'm drunk.

512
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:43,276
I wouldn't risk coming in here

513
00:28:43,309 --> 00:28:46,945
and associating myself
with your little resistance cell

514
00:28:46,986 --> 00:28:48,581
if I wasn't drunk.

515
00:28:48,624 --> 00:28:50,094
Oh, well then maybe
you'd better leave

516
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:51,098
before someone sees you.

517
00:28:51,131 --> 00:28:53,296
I tried.

518
00:28:53,337 --> 00:28:56,243
I tried my best

519
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:59,413
to run my establishment
under this occupation.

520
00:28:59,454 --> 00:29:00,924
But you know what?

521
00:29:00,958 --> 00:29:02,622
It's no fun.

522
00:29:04,803 --> 00:29:07,606
I don't like Cardassians.

523
00:29:07,644 --> 00:29:10,641
They're mean and arrogant.

524
00:29:10,686 --> 00:29:14,025
And I can't stand the Jem'Hadar.

525
00:29:14,062 --> 00:29:15,623
They're creepy.

526
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:18,972
They just stand there
like statues

527
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:21,345
staring at you.

528
00:29:23,354 --> 00:29:25,326
That's it.

529
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,129
I don't want to spend
the rest of my life

530
00:29:28,168 --> 00:29:30,367
doing business
with these people.

531
00:29:30,408 --> 00:29:32,276
I want the Federation back.

532
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,477
I want to sell root beer again.

533
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:36,080
All right.

534
00:29:36,123 --> 00:29:38,060
You made your point.
Relax.

535
00:29:38,096 --> 00:29:40,398
How can I relax

536
00:29:40,436 --> 00:29:43,433
when there are thousands
of Jem'Hadar ships

537
00:29:43,477 --> 00:29:46,383
sitting on the other side
of the wormhole

538
00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:49,222
waiting to come through?

539
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,593
Don't worry about it.

540
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:51,929
They're stuck there.

541
00:29:51,968 --> 00:29:54,806
Not if what Damar told me
is true.

542
00:29:56,882 --> 00:29:58,819
What are you talking about?

543
00:29:58,854 --> 00:30:04,997
He said he came up with a way
to deactivate the mines.

544
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:08,844
Dukat wants him to start
field tests right away.

545
00:30:14,691 --> 00:30:16,559
Come on, Quark, think.

546
00:30:16,596 --> 00:30:19,297
Did Damar say anything
about how he was planning

547
00:30:19,337 --> 00:30:20,704
to deactivate the mines?

548
00:30:20,741 --> 00:30:22,040
Yes.

549
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:26,182
He said something
about the station's...

550
00:30:26,223 --> 00:30:27,385
defector.

551
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:29,956
Defector?

552
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,196
That's impossible.

553
00:30:31,237 --> 00:30:32,798
The only person on the station

554
00:30:32,842 --> 00:30:34,312
who knows anything
about the mines is...

555
00:30:34,346 --> 00:30:36,716
Me.

556
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,747
Defector.
That doesn't sound right.

557
00:30:38,792 --> 00:30:43,100
Maybe it was... deflector?

558
00:30:43,138 --> 00:30:44,300
Yeah.

559
00:30:44,341 --> 00:30:45,503
Yeah, that's it.

560
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:48,109
He said something
about using the station's...

561
00:30:48,152 --> 00:30:50,020
deflector array.

562
00:30:50,123 --> 00:30:51,718
What do you think, Rom?

563
00:30:51,761 --> 00:30:53,459
I'm glad it wasn't me.

564
00:30:53,499 --> 00:30:55,299
About the deflector array.

565
00:30:55,338 --> 00:30:58,871
Is there any way to use it
to deactivate the mines?

566
00:30:58,915 --> 00:31:00,214
No.

567
00:31:00,251 --> 00:31:02,952
I designed the mines
to be self-replicating.

568
00:31:02,992 --> 00:31:06,195
The only way to keep them
from replacing themselves

569
00:31:06,235 --> 00:31:08,970
is to isolate them
in an anti-graviton beam.

570
00:31:09,009 --> 00:31:11,106
The deflector array
can't do that.

571
00:31:11,149 --> 00:31:14,488
Unless...

572
00:31:14,525 --> 00:31:16,018
you reconfigured

573
00:31:16,063 --> 00:31:19,129
the field generators

574
00:31:19,171 --> 00:31:22,145
and refocused the emitters

575
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:25,485
which would turn
the deflector array

576
00:31:25,522 --> 00:31:30,058
into one big anti-graviton beam.

577
00:31:30,168 --> 00:31:33,804
Why didn't you think of that
when you set up the mine field?

578
00:31:33,846 --> 00:31:35,943
Uh, I don't know.

579
00:31:35,985 --> 00:31:38,321
Uh, he doesn't know.

580
00:31:38,358 --> 00:31:39,657
Quark.

581
00:31:39,695 --> 00:31:43,604
How can we disable
the deflector array?

582
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:45,634
All you have to do is
access the EPS feed

583
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:46,978
and overload the waveguide.

584
00:31:47,015 --> 00:31:48,417
All right, let's do it.

585
00:31:48,453 --> 00:31:50,925
But there's no way
to get to the EPS feed.

586
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,525
It's in a secured conduit
rigged with alarms.

587
00:31:53,567 --> 00:31:55,937
Odo, can you
disable those alarms?

588
00:31:55,974 --> 00:31:58,880
I can take them off-line
for about five minutes

589
00:31:58,916 --> 00:32:00,888
if I run a security diagnostic.

590
00:32:00,921 --> 00:32:02,448
Will that give you enough time?

591
00:32:02,492 --> 00:32:03,825
I think so.

592
00:32:03,863 --> 00:32:04,832
I'll run the diagnostic

593
00:32:04,866 --> 00:32:06,838
as soon as I get to my office.
In the morning.

594
00:32:06,871 --> 00:32:07,931
All right.

595
00:32:07,974 --> 00:32:10,105
You and I will meet here.

596
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:13,086
At exactly 0800

597
00:32:13,122 --> 00:32:14,956
you will begin the diagnostic.

598
00:32:21,746 --> 00:32:23,580
Has there been any news, sir?

599
00:32:23,618 --> 00:32:24,848
None.

600
00:32:24,889 --> 00:32:27,259
The <i>Defiant</i> has been gone
over 16 hours.

601
00:32:27,295 --> 00:32:28,525
Mr. Worf

602
00:32:28,565 --> 00:32:31,130
I know
this is difficult for you.

603
00:32:31,173 --> 00:32:32,506
Yes, sir.

604
00:32:34,649 --> 00:32:37,623
But I sense it is
more difficult for you.

605
00:32:37,657 --> 00:32:39,560
The <i>Defiant</i> is your ship.

606
00:32:39,596 --> 00:32:41,294
Dax'll bring her home.

607
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,202
Besides

608
00:32:43,273 --> 00:32:45,643
there's no way she's going
to miss her own wedding.

609
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,453
No, I suppose not.

610
00:32:49,491 --> 00:32:52,021
As soon as I hear anything,
I'll let you know.

611
00:32:52,064 --> 00:32:53,192
Thank you, sir.

612
00:32:53,234 --> 00:32:54,396
Captain...

613
00:32:54,438 --> 00:32:55,931
you should get some rest.

614
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:59,075
Not tonight, Mr. Worf.

615
00:32:59,117 --> 00:33:00,450
Not tonight.

616
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,862
Ben?

617
00:33:17,903 --> 00:33:19,202
Admiral.

618
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,835
It's late.

619
00:33:20,878 --> 00:33:24,115
I know. I was just waiting
to see if there was any news.

620
00:33:24,154 --> 00:33:28,622
Ben, we've got a big day
ahead of us tomorrow.

621
00:33:28,666 --> 00:33:30,934
I want to nail down the details
on the Bolian operation.

622
00:33:30,973 --> 00:33:32,203
I need you focused.

623
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:34,009
I will be.

624
00:33:34,048 --> 00:33:35,415
I know how you feel
about your crew

625
00:33:35,452 --> 00:33:37,822
but you and I are responsible
for an entire tactical wing.

626
00:33:37,859 --> 00:33:39,226
Thousands of lives depend

627
00:33:39,262 --> 00:33:41,130
on the decisions
we make tomorrow.

628
00:33:41,168 --> 00:33:43,504
You can't afford
to be awake all night

629
00:33:43,541 --> 00:33:45,068
worrying about one ship.

630
00:33:45,113 --> 00:33:47,608
Admiral, you can
order me to my quarters

631
00:33:47,653 --> 00:33:49,921
but there's no way
I'm going to sleep.

632
00:33:49,959 --> 00:33:52,524
Not as long as the <i>Defiant</i>
is out there.

633
00:33:53,569 --> 00:33:55,164
All right, as you wish

634
00:33:55,207 --> 00:33:58,774
but you should
understand one thing.

635
00:33:58,817 --> 00:34:02,122
With any luck, we'll be sending
the <i>Defiant</i> on a lot of missions

636
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:05,727
and you're going
to have to get used to it.

637
00:34:07,976 --> 00:34:09,104
Good night.

638
00:34:20,681 --> 00:34:24,054
Have our people always
been shape-shifters?

639
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:27,121
Or was there a time
when we were like the solids?

640
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:29,066
Eons ago, we were like them

641
00:34:29,104 --> 00:34:33,310
limited to one form,
but then... we evolved.

642
00:34:33,349 --> 00:34:34,443
Ah...

643
00:34:34,485 --> 00:34:35,647
On the homeworld

644
00:34:35,689 --> 00:34:37,661
are you always in the Link

645
00:34:37,694 --> 00:34:40,361
or do you sometimes
take solid form?

646
00:34:40,402 --> 00:34:42,032
We prefer the Link

647
00:34:42,073 --> 00:34:45,047
but, on occasion,
it is interesting

648
00:34:45,081 --> 00:34:47,611
to exist as something else...

649
00:34:47,656 --> 00:34:49,183
a tree perhaps...

650
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,562
a cloud in the sky.

651
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:56,204
Ah... a cloud.

652
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,613
How many of us are there?

653
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:58,914
Oh...

654
00:34:58,954 --> 00:35:01,222
so many questions, Odo.

655
00:35:01,328 --> 00:35:02,923
I'm sorry

656
00:35:02,966 --> 00:35:06,271
but there's still so much
that isn't clear to me yet.

657
00:35:06,308 --> 00:35:08,142
If you link with me again

658
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,949
everything
will be made clear to you.

659
00:35:11,991 --> 00:35:13,791
You have to understand

660
00:35:13,829 --> 00:35:17,202
that the Link is
very overwhelming for me.

661
00:35:17,305 --> 00:35:19,800
Right now, it's easier to talk.

662
00:35:19,846 --> 00:35:21,943
But words are so clumsy

663
00:35:21,985 --> 00:35:23,580
so imprecise.

664
00:35:23,623 --> 00:35:24,785
Even so.

665
00:35:26,364 --> 00:35:27,697
As you wish.

666
00:35:31,244 --> 00:35:33,341
You haven't told me your name.

667
00:35:33,383 --> 00:35:35,948
What use would I have
for a name?

668
00:35:35,991 --> 00:35:39,364
To differentiate yourself
from the others.

669
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,995
I don't.

670
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:44,309
But you are a separate
being, aren't you?

671
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:47,185
In a sense.

672
00:35:50,097 --> 00:35:52,399
When you return to the Link

673
00:35:52,436 --> 00:35:57,006
what will become of the entity
I'm talking to right now?

674
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:59,215
The drop becomes the ocean.

675
00:35:59,256 --> 00:36:03,029
And if you choose
to take solid form again?

676
00:36:03,067 --> 00:36:07,033
The ocean becomes a drop.

677
00:36:07,078 --> 00:36:08,411
Ah...

678
00:36:10,086 --> 00:36:12,388
yes.

679
00:36:12,426 --> 00:36:15,127
I think I'm beginning
to understand.

680
00:36:15,167 --> 00:36:18,073
Then you can answer
your own question.

681
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:20,674
How many of us are there?

682
00:36:20,715 --> 00:36:22,949
One.

683
00:36:22,988 --> 00:36:24,424
And many.

684
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:27,059
It depends
on how you look at it.

685
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:28,161
Very good.

686
00:36:28,204 --> 00:36:31,475
You are beginning to understand.

687
00:36:31,513 --> 00:36:35,149
But there's so much
you don't know.

688
00:36:37,496 --> 00:36:38,658
Tell me.

689
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,862
Oh.

690
00:36:39,903 --> 00:36:41,635
Words are insufficient.

691
00:36:41,674 --> 00:36:43,144
Link with me again.

692
00:36:43,179 --> 00:36:47,817
It is the only way I can give
you the understanding you seek.

693
00:36:47,858 --> 00:36:49,351
I can't.

694
00:36:49,396 --> 00:36:51,766
Why not?

695
00:36:51,802 --> 00:36:54,776
I promised Kira.

696
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:56,280
She is a solid.

697
00:36:56,315 --> 00:36:59,346
This has nothing to do with her.

698
00:36:59,391 --> 00:37:03,164
This is about you,
about what you want.

699
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:14,824
Am I early?

700
00:37:14,867 --> 00:37:15,961
A little.

701
00:37:16,004 --> 00:37:18,944
I hope there's more
than just fruit in that basket.

702
00:37:18,979 --> 00:37:21,417
I needed a place
to hide my tools.

703
00:37:21,518 --> 00:37:24,823
In case anybody asks,
I'm making a delivery.

704
00:37:24,861 --> 00:37:26,627
Right.

705
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:28,832
Here's your fruit.

706
00:37:28,873 --> 00:37:31,779
I didn't order any fruit.

707
00:37:31,814 --> 00:37:34,218
Oh, your brother sent this,
didn't he?

708
00:37:34,254 --> 00:37:36,556
If he is trying to win me over

709
00:37:36,595 --> 00:37:38,726
tell him it's just
not going to work.

710
00:37:38,767 --> 00:37:40,704
Better yet,
I'll tell him myself.

711
00:37:56,583 --> 00:37:59,250
Odo should be
in his office by now.

712
00:38:01,263 --> 00:38:02,562
Now.

713
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:06,007
Remember, he's going to
interrupt the sensor alarms

714
00:38:06,043 --> 00:38:07,570
at exactly 0800 hours.

715
00:38:07,614 --> 00:38:09,586
I'll be ready.

716
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,956
If there's a problem,
I'll contact you.

717
00:38:11,993 --> 00:38:13,827
Good luck with your delivery.

718
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:31,978
Computer, time.

719
00:38:32,016 --> 00:38:34,990
0700 hours, 58 minutes.

720
00:38:35,025 --> 00:38:36,689
Two minutes to go.

721
00:38:54,345 --> 00:38:55,541
Odo.

722
00:38:57,687 --> 00:38:59,955
Kira to Odo.
Please respond.

723
00:38:59,994 --> 00:39:01,989
Kira to Odo.

724
00:39:03,704 --> 00:39:05,231
Odo, answer me.

725
00:39:14,301 --> 00:39:15,600
Computer, time.

726
00:39:15,638 --> 00:39:17,974
0700 hours, 59 minutes.

727
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,477
Hello, Major.

728
00:39:20,518 --> 00:39:22,786
Just the person
I was looking for.

729
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:25,933
Congratulations
on your promotion

730
00:39:25,967 --> 00:39:27,437
but we'll have to discuss

731
00:39:27,471 --> 00:39:29,534
the personnel report
another time.

732
00:39:30,613 --> 00:39:32,311
We'll discuss it now.

733
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,249
I don't think so.

734
00:39:38,736 --> 00:39:40,867
Kira to Rom.
Don't open that hatch.

735
00:39:41,878 --> 00:39:42,972
I already did.

736
00:39:43,015 --> 00:39:44,542
Get out of there.

737
00:39:46,792 --> 00:39:47,954
Intruder alert.

738
00:39:47,995 --> 00:39:49,328
Come with me.

739
00:40:07,583 --> 00:40:09,383
Well, well...

740
00:40:09,421 --> 00:40:11,324
what do we have here?

741
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:19,063
Captain's Log, Tactical Update,
Stardate 51149.5.

742
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,595
The <i>Defiant</i> has returned
to Starbase 375

743
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:25,047
after its successful attack
on the Dominion sensor array.

744
00:40:25,083 --> 00:40:26,519
Admiral Ross and I
have recommended

745
00:40:26,554 --> 00:40:28,856
that Commander Dax
and the entire <i>Defiant</i> crew

746
00:40:28,894 --> 00:40:32,427
be cited for exceptional
performance of their duties.

747
00:40:34,008 --> 00:40:35,444
Admiral on deck!

748
00:40:35,479 --> 00:40:36,539
Carry on.

749
00:40:36,582 --> 00:40:39,522
Nog, Saurian brandy
for the brass.

750
00:40:39,557 --> 00:40:41,654
Dax, could you
tell Ensign Kirby

751
00:40:41,696 --> 00:40:43,257
how I took over the con

752
00:40:43,301 --> 00:40:44,600
when Lieutenant Haj was injured?

753
00:40:44,638 --> 00:40:45,766
She doesn't believe me.

754
00:40:45,808 --> 00:40:48,475
Frankly, I'm not sure
I believe it happened myself.

755
00:40:49,986 --> 00:40:51,046
Sir. Sir.

756
00:40:53,296 --> 00:40:54,732
Congratulations, Captain.

757
00:40:54,767 --> 00:40:55,758
Thank you, sir.

758
00:40:55,803 --> 00:40:57,205
Will you excuse me a minute?

759
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,368
Julian needs me.

760
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:00,439
Certainly.

761
00:41:01,552 --> 00:41:03,455
Here you are.

762
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:04,823
Don't ask where he got it.

763
00:41:04,861 --> 00:41:06,729
Don't worry.

764
00:41:06,766 --> 00:41:08,634
I don't want to know.

765
00:41:13,251 --> 00:41:14,687
Here's another one, Captain.

766
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:24,882
Take a good look...

767
00:41:24,917 --> 00:41:27,914
because this says
something about us...

768
00:41:27,959 --> 00:41:29,793
that we're willing to fight

769
00:41:29,831 --> 00:41:31,392
and that we'll keep on fighting

770
00:41:31,503 --> 00:41:33,805
until we can't fight anymore.

771
00:41:33,842 --> 00:41:35,369
Yes, sir!

772
00:41:35,414 --> 00:41:37,909
You don't throw
something like this away.

773
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:39,685
No, sir!

774
00:41:50,422 --> 00:41:51,618
Hear, hear.

775
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,466
They're a good crew.

776
00:41:56,506 --> 00:41:57,999
The best.

777
00:42:01,553 --> 00:42:03,923
What do you say
we get back to work?

778
00:42:34,412 --> 00:42:35,882
What the hell happened?

779
00:42:35,915 --> 00:42:38,080
Why didn't you
disable that alarm?

780
00:42:39,326 --> 00:42:41,229
It's difficult to explain.

781
00:42:41,264 --> 00:42:44,136
Rom is sitting in a holding
cell being interrogated.

782
00:42:44,172 --> 00:42:45,471
He was counting on you.

783
00:42:45,509 --> 00:42:47,207
I was counting on you!

784
00:42:47,248 --> 00:42:48,478
I know.

785
00:42:48,517 --> 00:42:49,781
You know?

786
00:42:49,821 --> 00:42:51,952
Do you realize
what you just did?

787
00:42:51,994 --> 00:42:55,436
You just handed the Alpha
Quadrant to the Dominion.

788
00:42:55,471 --> 00:42:57,466
I was in the Link.

789
00:42:57,509 --> 00:43:00,210
Are you saying you forgot?

790
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:01,880
I didn't forget.

791
00:43:01,922 --> 00:43:04,292
It just...
didn't seem to matter.

792
00:43:04,328 --> 00:43:07,770
A lot of people
are going to die.

793
00:43:07,805 --> 00:43:09,400
Don't you care?

794
00:43:09,443 --> 00:43:13,409
It has nothing to do with me.

795
00:43:14,524 --> 00:43:16,324
How can you say that?

796
00:43:18,033 --> 00:43:20,836
If you could experience the Link

797
00:43:20,874 --> 00:43:23,940
you'd know
why nothing else matters.

798
00:43:23,984 --> 00:43:26,456
The last five years...

799
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:28,985
your life here, our friendship...

800
00:43:29,031 --> 00:43:30,592
none of that matters?

801
00:43:30,702 --> 00:43:32,833
It did... once.

802
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,182
I wish I could
make you understand

803
00:43:37,221 --> 00:43:38,885
but you can't.

804
00:43:38,925 --> 00:43:41,022
You're not a changeling.

805
00:43:42,502 --> 00:43:43,664
You're right.

806
00:43:45,176 --> 00:43:46,509
I'm a solid.

807
00:44:02,324 --> 00:44:05,264
You look troubled, Odo.

808
00:44:05,299 --> 00:44:07,099
Did she upset you?

809
00:44:10,781 --> 00:44:13,346
No, not really.

810
00:44:15,995 --> 00:44:16,986
Ah.
