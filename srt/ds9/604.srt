00:00:01,793 --> 00:00:06,089
SISKO:<i> Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 51145.3.</i>

2
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:09,551
<i>The </i>Defiant <i>has been operating </i>
<i>out of Starbase 375</i>

3
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:12,595
<i>conducting forays </i>
<i>into Dominion controlled space.</i>

4
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:15,598
<i>While the missions have taken a toll </i>
<i>on my people</i>

5
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:19,310
<i>they remain determined to do</i>
<i>whatever it takes to win this war</i>

6
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:20,937
<i>as do I.</i>

7
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:23,523
NOG: Here you are.

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,067
Where did you get your hands
on Saurian brandy?

9
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,610
In the middle of a war, no less.

10
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:29,654
It's a busy star base.

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,907
I may be a cadet, but I'm still a Ferengi.

12
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:34,284
Lucky for us.

13
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:45,336
Excuse me, Captain.

14
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:47,756
The power cell from the phaser array.

15
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,883
We used it up on the last mission.

16
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:59,350
Take a good look at this, people.
It says something about this ship.

17
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,270
It says that we will fight

18
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,775
and we will keep on fighting
until we can't fight anymore.

19
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:08,276
CREW: Yes, sir.

20
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:10,945
You don't just throw
something like this away.

21
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:12,739
CREW: No, sir.

22
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,078
( all cheer )

23
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,166
Admiral on deck.

24
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,335
As you were.

25
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:27,253
Ben.

26
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:28,588
Admiral.

27
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,257
Um, let's, uh, take a walk.

28
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,553
What was going on in there?

29
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:39,766
Just a little ritual we fell into.
It kind of helps the crew unwind.

30
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,810
Well, they deserve it.
They did a hell of a job.

31
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:42,727
Thank you, sir.

32
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,939
But you didn't come here
to tell me that, did you?

33
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,442
( chuckles )
No, I didn't.

34
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,945
Ever since this war began,
the Dominion's been able

35
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,696
to outmaneuver us at every turn.

36
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,115
Wherever we send our ships

37
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,908
they seem to be there waiting for us.

38
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,243
I've noticed that.

39
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:01,371
It was enough to make you think
that they were smarter than we are.

40
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,497
But they're not.

41
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:05,041
They just had an edge that we didn't know
anything about...

42
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,876
Until yesterday.

43
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,797
Starfleet Intelligence
has located a massive sensor array

44
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,549
hidden on the periphery
of the Argolis Cluster.

45
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:16,845
The damn thing's capable of monitoring
ship movements over five sectors.

46
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:20,014
That's how they managed
to stay one step ahead of us.

47
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,892
They've had an enormous
tactical advantage.

48
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,395
I want you to take it away from them.

49
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:26,980
Gladly, sir.

50
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,858
BEN: It won't be easy.
The array is heavily defended.

51
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:33,736
This is the intelligence report.
Look it over.

52
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,781
I want an attack plan on my desk by 0800.

53
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,158
You'll have it.

54
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:51,588
ROM: There he is.

55
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,756
Damar's a creature of habit, all right.

56
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,969
KIRA: After a hard day at work,
he deserves his glass of <i>kanar.</i>

57
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:03,808
"Why are the Jem'Hadar always in here?"
He asks himself.

58
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,978
They don't drink. They don't eat.
They don't gamble.

59
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:11,357
All they do is take up space.
Damar asks his bartender

60
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,985
KIRA: if he found a padd
he was working on the other day.

61
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:16,529
ROM: My brother tells the truth.
He hasn't seen it.

62
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:20,450
Damar doesn't like that.
The padd contained a draft copy

63
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:24,412
of a secret memorandum he was working on
concerning the shortage of white.

64
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:29,208
In it, he speculates that, without
the drug the Jem'Hadar will run amok

65
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,085
killing everyone and everything
in their path.

66
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,256
Damar recommends that if the Cardassians
can't bring down the minefield

67
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,800
and reopen the supply-line
from the Gamma Quadrant

68
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:41,346
they should poison the last ration
of white

69
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:44,265
eliminating the Jem'Hadar
before it's too late.

70
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,602
How did you get a hold
of Damar's padd anyway?

71
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,271
I'm good with my hands.

72
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,440
Here we go.

73
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,443
They've seen him.

74
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:57,987
JEM'HADAR: Damar.

75
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,073
KIRA: The missing padd.

76
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,367
DAMAR: Where'd you find that?

77
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,119
KIRA: Damar accuses them of stealing it.

78
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,413
ROM: But they say they found it
outside their quarters...

79
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,457
Right where I left it.

80
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,585
DAMAR: Have you and your whole race thrown
off of this station!

81
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:16,923
I knew this was going to work.
The Cardassians and the Jem'Hadar

82
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,549
can pretend to be allies...

83
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,468
But they hate each other.

84
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:21,469
DAMAR: Get out of my way!

85
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:22,637
( Quark screaming )

86
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,638
Ow.

87
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,937
( cries out )

88
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:32,939
( groans )

89
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,110
{\an8}DAMAR: When I confronted them,
they attacked me.

90
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,778
{\an8}I don't care what they did.

91
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:46,614
{\an8}You should never have let
this situation get out of hand.

92
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:47,573
{\an8}Get out!

93
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:02,463
{\an8}How could Damar be so stupid as to leave
such an inflammatory document

94
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:05,842
{\an8}-lying around for anyone to find?
-Your men stole it from him.

95
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,761
{\an8}-Jem'Hadar are not thieves.
-And Damar is not a liar.

96
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,471
{\an8}Keep your voice down.

97
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:20,690
{\an8}Our men need
to see that we're still allies.

98
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:22,942
{\an8}Smile.

99
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:25,820
{\an8}Dukat.

100
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,280
{\an8}I'm smiling.

101
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,323
{\an8}Gentlemen, I suggest we get everyone
out of here

102
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,741
{\an8}as soon as possible.

103
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:31,701
{\an8}Odo's right.

104
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:35,913
{\an8}Tell your men they're confined to quarters
pending disciplinary hearings.

105
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,457
{\an8}I'll do the same.

106
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,417
{\an8}And keep smiling.

107
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,179
{\an8}( chuckles )

108
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:53,973
{\an8}Come.

109
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,942
SISKO: According to Intelligence

110
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,861
the array is capable
of detecting cloaked ships

111
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,946
as far as two light years away.

112
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,699
By the time the <i>Defiant </i>goes around
the Argolis Cluster

113
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,160
the Dominion will already
know we're coming.

114
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:17,288
You'll have a dozen Jem'Hadar ships on you
before you can even get close.

115
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,665
That's why we need the element
of surprise on our side.

116
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:20,666
It's the only way.

117
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,460
What are you suggesting?

118
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,213
That I take the <i>Defiant </i>
through the Argolis.

119
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,714
You can't get a ship through there.

120
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:30,051
You'd be cut to pieces
by the gravimetric shear.

121
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,261
That's exactly what the Dominion thinks.

122
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,680
But if we come at them from the Argolis

123
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:35,932
they won't know what hit them.

124
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:37,975
What makes you think you can get through?

125
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:41,395
Dax says she can navigate
around the gravimetric distortions.

126
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,607
She's studied protostar clusters.
She knows what to look for.

127
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,819
It's a gamble
but it's one I'm willing to take.

128
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,072
All right.

129
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,033
Let's give it a shot.

130
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:56,911
When can you leave?

131
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,705
As soon as we finish repairs
on the <i>Defiant.</i>

132
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,625
Keep me posted, Captain.

133
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,725
( door opens )

134
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,270
You wanted to see me.

135
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,106
Well?

136
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,150
Don't you have something to say to me?

137
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,320
-About what happened at Quark's?
-Yeah.

138
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,907
-It worked better than I expected.
-I knew you were behind it!

139
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,367
Of course you did.

140
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,287
We discussed it at our last
resistance meeting.

141
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,914
And I said it was a bad idea.

142
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,791
Yes, you did.

143
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:47,253
And then you walked out of the room
like there was nothing left to say.

144
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:50,840
But Rom and Jake stayed
and we discussed it, and you know what?

145
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,718
I decided it was a good idea.

146
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:56,846
So you went ahead
and did it behind my back?

147
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,348
Why are you taking this so personally?

148
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,267
How do you expect me to take it?

149
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,854
I spend my days sitting on the Council
with Dukat and Weyoun

150
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,607
doing whatever I can
to make sure that Bajor

151
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:11,277
survives this war intact.
The last thing I need

152
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,155
is to have you running around
causing mayhem.

153
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:18,784
Do you have any idea what Dukat would do
if he found out you were behind it?

154
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:22,955
It's all the excuse he would need
to throw every Bajoran off this station.

155
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:28,961
The Federation is losing this war.
We can't sit by and do nothing.

156
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:32,131
There are limits to what we can do.

157
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,341
I'm beginning to think

158
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,301
you shouldn't have agreed
to sit on that Council.

159
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:39,347
It's as if you're so invested
in making sure the station runs smoothly

160
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,098
you've forgotten there's a war going on.

161
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,601
Are you questioning my loyalties, Major?

162
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,227
I need you, Odo.

163
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:48,397
The resistance needs you.

164
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,359
Answer me.

165
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,988
-Are you questioning my loyalties?
-Oh, of course not.

166
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,365
That's not what this is about--

167
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,741
( door opens )

168
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:06,123
Hello, Odo.
It's good to see you again.

169
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,549
Leave us.
I need to speak with Odo.

170
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:16,509
Do you?

171
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:22,807
It's all right, Nerys.
I may as well hear what she has to say.

172
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,058
Are you sure?

173
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,902
You called her "Nerys."

174
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,320
What of it?

175
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,198
Well, you used to call her "Major."

176
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:42,701
Using the name
of a solid denotes intimacy.

177
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,205
You're a long way from home.

178
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,334
Here to keep an eye on the war effort?

179
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:54,422
I'm content to leave the details
of the war to the Vorta.

180
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,342
Then what brings you to Deep Space 9?

181
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,177
You.

182
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,723
I was trapped in the Alpha Quadrant

183
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:08,436
when Captain Sisko mined
the entrance to the wormhole.

184
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,730
I have spent too much time
with solids.

185
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:16,944
I came because I felt the need
to be with one of my own.

186
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,070
Ah.

187
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,322
Well, that's ironic

188
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,701
considering what happened
the last time we crossed paths.

189
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:28,539
You caused the death
of a fellow changeling, Odo.

190
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,374
Turning you into a solid

191
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,794
was the only punishment
severe enough for your crime.

192
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,839
And now that I'm a changeling again

193
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,258
you come here as though nothing
ever happened?

194
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,343
We have forgiven you.

195
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,638
Well, I haven't forgiven you.

196
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:49,685
It is time to put the past behind us, Odo.

197
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,353
And what about the present?

198
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,981
You're waging a war against my home.

199
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,733
This is not your home.

200
00:12:56,775 --> 00:13:00,237
You belong with your own kind
as part of the Great Link.

201
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,948
I'm quite content here, thank you.

202
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:07,203
You say that because you don't know
what you're capable of becoming.

203
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:14,627
Perhaps if we spent some time together
you might begin to understand.

204
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,398
Admiral, you wanted to see me?

205
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:39,777
I just got word.

206
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,238
Captain Bennet's promotion
has come through.

207
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:45,282
At my recommendation
Starfleet's putting her in charge

208
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,492
of Seventh Tactical Wing.

209
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,411
She was one of the best
adjutants I've ever had,

210
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,581
a strong grasp of strategy
and ability to see the big picture.

211
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:56,126
Sounds like it's not going to be easy
to find someone to take her place.

212
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:59,296
I already have you.

213
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,714
Sir?

214
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,718
I've been very impressed with you
over these past few weeks.

215
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,720
I think we would make a good team.

216
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,097
Thank you, sir.

217
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,350
Your new assignment
is effective immediately.

218
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:12,643
Immediately, sir?

219
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,229
What about the Argolis mission?

220
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,690
Commander Dax will captain the <i>Defiant.</i>

221
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,235
She is up to it, isn't she?

222
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,736
Oh, absolutely, sir.

223
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:29,702
I guess I'd just gotten used to the idea
of commanding the mission myself.

224
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,539
Look over these tactical reports.

225
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,916
I want your thoughts
on the Bolian operation.

226
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,585
We'll meet here at 0600.

227
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:41,589
Ben...

228
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,427
Congratulations.

229
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:58,731
Legate Krim will be arriving
in the morning.

230
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:02,484
I'll have a security detail
escort him to your office.

231
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:04,904
Well, if that's all...

232
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:17,124
Founder, you honor us with your presence.

233
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,627
I understand the war is going well.

234
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,880
Only because I've followed the plan
the Founders laid out for me.

235
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,424
Welcome to Terok Nor.

236
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,136
I'm glad we're finally getting
a chance to meet.

237
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,849
As leaders of our respective worlds
you and I will be taking our people

238
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,143
into a future that I'm quite confident--

239
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,436
What about the minefield?

240
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,813
Why hasn't it been deactivated?

241
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:41,941
Yes, Dukat.

242
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,151
This delay is intolerable.

243
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,863
There are thousands of Jem'Hadar ships
stranded on the other side of the wormhole

244
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,990
waiting to come through
and join the war effort.

245
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,535
Maybe you haven't read the latest reports

246
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:58,791
but even without those ships
I'm still winning this war.

247
00:15:59,083 --> 00:15:59,917
You're winning?

248
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:03,504
I assure you, I'm intimately involved
in all military decisions.

249
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,048
See to it the minefield is brought down.

250
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,050
Of course.

251
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,220
We've imposed our presence
on you long enough.

252
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:18,060
If there's anything you
need while you're here

253
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,396
please, let me know.

254
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,822
Do they always compete
with one another like that?

255
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,741
As a matter of fact, they do.

256
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,452
You have to interact with them often.

257
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,746
It must be trying for you.

258
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,832
It hasn't been easy.

259
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,712
Now, if you'll excuse me
I have some work to do in my quarters.

260
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,880
May I walk with you?

261
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:05,107
To become a thing is to know a thing.

262
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,276
To assume its form

263
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,654
is to begin to understand its existence.

264
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:15,034
You tried to teach me that when I visited
our homeworld.

265
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,076
Hmm...

266
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,453
I remember.

267
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,248
I didn't understand
what you meant by it at first.

268
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,585
So when I returned to the station
I got rid of all the furniture

269
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:28,672
I used to have in my quarters
and replaced it with these objects.

270
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,551
I've assumed every shape in this room.

271
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,847
I suppose if it weren't for you

272
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,475
I never would have known
the simple pleasure

273
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:43,270
of spending time existing
as a stone or a branch.

274
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:46,732
I'm glad you learned something
from your visit.

275
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:50,444
Your arrival was a time of great joy
for the Link

276
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,656
and your departure,
a time of great sadness.

277
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,410
If only you had stayed
with us, Odo...

278
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,788
I couldn't.

279
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,666
You chose the solids.

280
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,045
And I haven't
regretted it.

281
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,297
Not even a little?

282
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:16,470
I do think about the Link
from time to time.

283
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:18,847
It's there for you.

284
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:21,642
I can't.

285
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:22,893
Why?

286
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,854
Because of Kira?

287
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,984
You still have feelings
for her, don't you?

288
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,695
But she doesn't share them.

289
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,156
I'm sorry.

290
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,076
Aren't you going to tell me

291
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,537
I shouldn't waste my time
with a solid?

292
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,540
You love her.

293
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,294
And I wish I didn't.

294
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,508
I'm so vulnerable to her.

295
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:58,720
All she has to do is smile at me
and I'm happy beyond reason.

296
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,558
A minor disagreement between us
and I'm devastated.

297
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:04,726
It's absurd.

298
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,896
Sometimes,
I wish I could reach inside myself

299
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,648
and tear out my feelings for her.

300
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,067
But I can't.

301
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,070
Poor Odo

302
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,156
I don't want your pity.

303
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,867
I am not offering pity.

304
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,163
What I need is some peace.

305
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,332
What you need is clarity.

306
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,507
I can give you that.

307
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,026
Do you want me to stop?

308
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:21,887
That'll be all.

309
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:30,520
What are you doing here, Damar?
Did Dukat demote you to security detail?

310
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,899
-What can I do for you, Major?
-I'm looking for Odo.

311
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,945
Well, he's not here.

312
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,030
Do you know where he is?

313
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,949
Yes.

314
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,452
That's good.
It's good to know where your boss is.

315
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,792
He's in his quarters
with the other shape-shifter.

316
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,710
Jealous, Major?

317
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,214
Try to stay out of trouble, Damar.

318
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,425
You don't want to end up
on sanitation duty.

319
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,516
( door chimes )

320
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:09,601
Come in.

321
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,107
Odo?

322
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:18,735
Nerys.

323
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:22,572
I dropped by your office
and Damar told me you were here with her.

324
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,075
She was here, but she's gone now.

325
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,785
You all right?

326
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,287
What did she want?

327
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,790
She didn't want anything.

328
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,001
Then what was she doing here?

329
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,464
I know how you feel about her, Major

330
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,676
but there's no reason to be concerned.

331
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:46,722
You don't know how much
I wish I could believe that.

332
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,391
You didn't link with her, did you?

333
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:54,730
Actually, I did.

334
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:56,773
You did?

335
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,528
What were you thinking?

336
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:08,243
She didn't find out about the resistance
if that's why you're worried.

337
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:09,453
It's not.

338
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:13,999
The Link isn't about
exchanging information.

339
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,919
It's about merging thought and form,
idea and sensation.

340
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:21,214
That sounds like a perfect way
to manipulate someone.

341
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:24,134
She's not manipulating me.

342
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,180
Ever since
the day you two crossed paths

343
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:32,017
she has lied to you, tricked you

344
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,312
stood in judgment of you.
I don't trust her.

345
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,314
I don't understand
how you can.

346
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,025
I linked with her.

347
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,903
If she had any hidden motive
I would have sensed it.

348
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:46,573
She's just trying to teach me
about myself,

349
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:50,911
-about what I'm capable of becoming.
-An intergalactic warlord, maybe?

350
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,579
Because that's what she is.

351
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:55,624
Who knows?
By linking with her

352
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,001
I might be able
to make her understand

353
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:01,338
that the Federation doesn't pose
a threat to her people.

354
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:06,468
You believe you can convince her
to call off the war?

355
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,638
If you could experience the Link

356
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:14,351
you'd understand the effect
it has on my people.

357
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,604
You'd realize that anything is possible.

358
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:22,651
I'm only beginning
to understand it all, myself.

359
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,152
I still have so many questions.

360
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:27,781
Now that she's here, I have a chance
to find some answers.

361
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:32,244
Odo, this isn't the time
to go off on some kind of personal quest.

362
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,538
There's too much at stake.

363
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:39,918
After the war
is over, do whatever you need to do.

364
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:42,838
If you feel you need to go
and join the Great Link

365
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,548
I'm... I'm not going to stop you.

366
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,842
But for right now

367
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,513
I need you here... focused.
Please promise me

368
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:54,349
that you're not going
to link with her again.

369
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,811
Not until this is over.

370
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:01,857
All right.

371
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,441
I won't.

372
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:07,779
Now, if you'll excuse me
I have to get to work.

373
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,616
I'll see you at the resistance meeting.

374
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:42,439
-Are you two ever going to be finished?
-Just a few more minutes, Commander.

375
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:45,400
That's "Captain."

376
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,486
It's an old naval tradition.
Whoever's in command of a ship

377
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,198
regardless of rank
is referred to as "Captain."

378
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,286
You mean, if I had to take command
I would be called "Captain," too?

379
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:59,539
Cadet, by the time you took command

380
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:02,083
there'd be nobody left
to call you anything.

381
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,211
Good point.

382
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,677
Come to take a last look around?

383
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,846
Not a last look, I hope.

384
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:16,723
How are the repairs coming?

385
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:18,767
Almost done.

386
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:22,187
I wouldn't get too comfortable
in that chair, old man.

387
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:24,814
When this war is over
I'm going to want my ship back.

388
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,693
Fine. When this war's over
I'm going on a honeymoon.

389
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,237
All done here, Captain.

390
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:31,738
-Very well.
-All right.

391
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:39,621
Plot a course for the Argolis Cluster
and prepare for departure.

392
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:40,664
HELM: Aye, Captain.

393
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,377
Benjamin...

394
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,630
I wish you were coming with us.

395
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,257
You'll do fine.

396
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,190
( sighs )

397
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:19,244
Pardon our appearance.
We're renovating.

398
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,454
<i>Kanar.</i>

399
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:26,876
Not that one.

400
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:28,920
The '27.

401
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,297
'27?

402
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:34,217
Expensive.

403
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,887
I can afford it...
On a Gul's salary.

404
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:39,723
Wait a minute.

405
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,976
You started a fight in my bar
and now you're getting a promotion?

406
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:45,687
What kind of way is that to run an army?

407
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:50,108
Dukat wasn't happy about what happened.
I had to find a way to make it up to him.

408
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,319
I hope it was something big.

409
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:54,696
Let's just say...

410
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,907
It will change the course of history.

411
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:01,828
As a businessman

412
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,998
I'm very interested
in the course of history.

413
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:08,960
This one's on me.

414
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:13,298
Well, that's very kind of you, Quark...

415
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,972
but I can't talk about it.

416
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:23,725
Of course.

417
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:28,521
I understand.
Here. Let me pour you another.

418
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:46,790
There's obviously a lot of bad blood
between the Cardassians and the Jem'Hadar.

419
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:50,126
It wouldn't take much
to get them to go at each other again.

420
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,087
Yeah, I'm not sure we want to do that.

421
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,421
But it worked so well.

422
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:55,590
What do you think, Odo?

423
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,553
I'm not sure it's a good idea.

424
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:01,805
Then we'll do something else.

425
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,431
-Major...
-Something

426
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,849
that we can all agree on.

427
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:06,684
( door chimes )

428
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:09,562
Who could that be?

429
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:13,191
We're just sitting here
enjoying each other's company.

430
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:15,693
Right.

431
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,694
Come in.

432
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:20,448
Brother...

433
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,909
are you all right?

434
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:25,912
No, I am not all right.

435
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:30,750
I just shared a bottle
of <i>kanar </i>with Damar.

436
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,752
( laughing )

437
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,170
That rhymes.

438
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,964
( laughing )

439
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,340
You're drunk.

440
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,968
Of course I'm drunk.

441
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,637
I wouldn't risk coming in here

442
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:46,099
and associating myself
with your little resistance cell

443
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,600
if I wasn't drunk.

444
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,227
Oh, well then maybe
you'd better leave

445
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,270
before someone sees you.

446
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,230
I tried.

447
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,567
I tried my best

448
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,528
to run my establishment
under this occupation.

449
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,489
But you know what?
It's no fun.

450
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,453
I don't like Cardassians.

451
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:13,126
They're mean and arrogant.
And I can't stand the Jem'Hadar.

452
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:14,502
They're creepy.

453
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:19,507
They just stand there like statues
staring at you.

454
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:23,970
That's it.

455
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:29,225
I don't want to spend the rest of my life
doing business with these people.

456
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,394
I want the Federation back.

457
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,105
I want to sell root beer again.

458
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:35,231
KIRA:
All right.

459
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:38,526
-You made your point. Relax.
-How can I relax

460
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:42,572
when there are thousands
of Jem'Hadar ships

461
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:45,283
sitting on the other side
of the wormhole

462
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,036
waiting to come through?

463
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,955
Don't worry about it.
They're stuck there.

464
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,583
Not if what Damar
told me is true.

465
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,337
What are you talking about?

466
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:03,718
He said he came up with a way
to deactivate the mines.

467
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:07,806
Dukat wants him
to start field tests right away.

468
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,105
Come on, Quark, think.

469
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,817
Did Damar say anything
about how he was planning

470
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,026
to deactivate the mines?

471
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,362
Yes.

472
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,698
He said something
about the station's...

473
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,200
Defector.

474
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:30,411
-Defector?
-That's impossible.

475
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:34,290
The only person on the station
who knows anything about the mines is...

476
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,208
Me.

477
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,961
Defector.
That doesn't sound right.

478
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:41,965
Maybe it was... deflector?

479
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:45,134
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

480
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,720
He said something
about using the station's...

481
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:49,681
Deflector array.

482
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,349
What do you think, Rom?

483
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:55,353
I'm glad it wasn't me.
About the deflector array.

484
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,648
Is there any way to use it
to deactivate the mines?

485
00:30:58,731 --> 00:30:59,566
No.

486
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:02,485
I designed the mines
to be self-replicating.

487
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,779
The only way to keep them
from replacing themselves

488
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,448
is to isolate them
in an anti-graviton beam.

489
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:10,076
The deflector array
can't do that.

490
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,704
Unless...

491
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:18,042
you reconfigured
the field generators

492
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,629
and refocused the emitters

493
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:25,049
which would turn
the deflector array

494
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:30,263
into one big anti-graviton beam.

495
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:33,516
Why didn't you think of that
when you set up the mine field?

496
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:35,268
Uh, I don't know.

497
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,896
( <i>imitating </i>) Uh, he doesn't know.

498
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:38,938
Quark.

499
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,234
How can we disable the deflector array?

500
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,946
All you have to do is access the EPS feed
and overload the waveguide.

501
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,114
All right, let's do it.

502
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:50,325
But there's no way
to get to the EPS feed.

503
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:53,202
It's in a secured conduit
rigged with alarms.

504
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,622
Odo, can you disable those alarms?

505
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,541
I can take them off-line
for about five minutes

506
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,543
if I run a security diagnostic.

507
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:02,587
-Will that give you enough time?
-I think so.

508
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:04,756
I'll run the diagnostic

509
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,257
as soon as I get to my office
in the morning.

510
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:09,594
All right.
You and I will meet here.

511
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:15,141
At exactly 0800
you will begin the diagnostic.

512
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,982
<i>Has there been any news, sir?</i>

513
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:23,900
None.

514
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,903
<i>The </i>Defiant <i>has been gone</i>
<i>over 16 hours.</i>

515
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,154
Mr. Worf

516
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:30,448
I know
this is difficult for you.

517
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,075
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

518
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:38,623
<i>But I sense it is more difficult for you.</i>
<i>The </i>Defiant<i> is your ship.</i>

519
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:40,833
Dax'll bring her home.

520
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:45,171
Besides there's no way she's going
to miss her own wedding.

521
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:48,841
<i>No, I suppose not.</i>

522
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,427
As soon as I hear anything,
I'll let you know.

523
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:55,223
<i>Thank you, sir. Captain...</i>
<i>You should get some rest.</i>

524
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,475
Not tonight, Mr. Worf.

525
00:32:58,935 --> 00:32:59,978
Not tonight.

526
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:19,247
-Ben?
-Admiral.

527
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:20,373
It's late.

528
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:23,167
I know. I was just waiting
to see if there was any news.

529
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,131
Ben, we've got a big day
ahead of us tomorrow.

530
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,466
I want to nail down the details
on the Bolian operation.

531
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,593
I need you focused.
I will be.

532
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:34,554
I know how you feel about your crew

533
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:37,306
but you and I are responsible
for an entire tactical wing.

534
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,101
Thousands of lives depend
on the decisions we make tomorrow.

535
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:44,397
You can't afford to be awake all night
worrying about one ship.

536
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:49,235
Admiral, you can order me to my quarters
but there's no way I'm going to sleep.

537
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:51,446
Not as long as the <i>Defiant </i>is out there.

538
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:54,198
All right, as you wish...

539
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,618
But you should understand one thing.

540
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:01,581
With any luck, we'll be sending
the <i>Defiant </i>on a lot of missions

541
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,709
and you're going
to have to get used to it.

542
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,337
Good night.

543
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:23,478
Have our people always
been shape-shifters?

544
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,522
Or was there a time
when we were like the solids?

545
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:32,945
Eons ago, we were like them limited
to one form, but then... we evolved.

546
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,072
Ah...

547
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:37,492
On the homeworld
are you always in the Link

548
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,994
or do you sometimes
take solid form?

549
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,370
We prefer the Link

550
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:45,792
but, on occasion, it is interesting
to exist as something else,

551
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:49,879
a tree perhaps...
A cloud in the sky.

552
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,298
Ah... a cloud.

553
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,220
How many of us are there?

554
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:58,137
Oh...

555
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,556
so many questions, Odo.

556
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:05,603
I'm sorry but there's still so much
that isn't clear to me yet.

557
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:10,274
If you link with me again
everything will be made clear to you.

558
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:16,697
You have to understand
that the Link is very overwhelming for me.

559
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:21,285
Right now, it's easier to talk.
But words are so clumsy

560
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,870
so imprecise.

561
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,080
Even so.

562
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:27,458
As you wish.

563
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,630
You haven't told me your name.

564
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:35,466
What use would I have for a name?

565
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:38,344
To differentiate yourself
from the others.

566
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,179
I don't.

567
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:43,850
But you are a separate
being, aren't you?

568
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:46,686
In a sense.

569
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:54,527
When you return to the Link
what will become of the entity

570
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,070
I'm talking to right now?

571
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,906
The drop becomes
the ocean.

572
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,743
And if you choose
to take solid form again?

573
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,288
The ocean becomes a drop.

574
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:07,832
Ah...

575
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,418
Yes.

576
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,838
I think I'm beginning to understand.

577
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:17,008
Then you can answer
your own question.

578
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,468
How many of us are there?

579
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:23,514
One. And many.

580
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:26,309
It depends on how you look at it.

581
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:27,518
Very good.

582
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,979
You are beginning to understand.

583
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,483
But there's so much you don't know.

584
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:38,070
Tell me.

585
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:38,988
Oh.

586
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:43,117
Words are insufficient.
Link with me again.

587
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:46,954
It is the only way I can give
you the understanding you seek.

588
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:48,539
I can't.

589
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,041
Why not?

590
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,127
I promised Kira.

591
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:58,841
She is a solid.
This has nothing to do with her.

592
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:02,470
This is about you about what you want.

593
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,858
-Am I early?
-A little.

594
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,611
I hope there's more
than just fruit in that basket.

595
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,613
I needed a place to hide my tools.

596
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:23,908
In case anybody asks,
I'm making a delivery.

597
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:25,618
Right.

598
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:28,079
Here's your fruit.

599
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,039
I didn't order any fruit.

600
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:33,751
Oh, your brother sent this
didn't he?

601
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:37,755
If he is trying to win me over
tell him it's just not going to work.

602
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,966
Better yet, I'll tell him myself.

603
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:58,276
Odo should be in his office by now.

604
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:01,487
Now.

605
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:04,824
Remember, he's going to interrupt
the sensor alarms

606
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,659
at exactly 0800 hours.

607
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,452
I'll be ready.

608
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,040
If there's a problem, I'll contact you.
Good luck with your delivery.

609
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:31,559
Computer, time.

610
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:34,186
<i>0700 hours, 58 minutes.</i>

611
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,855
Two minutes to go.

612
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:54,665
Odo.

613
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:58,878
Kira to Odo. Please respond.

614
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,130
<i>Kira to Odo.</i>

615
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,133
<i>Odo, answer me.</i>

616
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:14,643
Computer, time.

617
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:17,313
COMPUTER:<i> 0700 hours, 59 minutes.</i>

618
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:22,068
Hello, Major.
Just the person I was looking for.

619
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:26,447
Congratulations, on your promotion
but we'll have to discuss

620
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,407
the personnel report another time.

621
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,327
We'll discuss it now.

622
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,288
I don't think so.

623
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,127
Kira to Rom. Don't open that hatch.

624
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,421
I already did.

625
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,006
KIRA: <i>Get out of there.</i>

626
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,008
( alarm blaring )

627
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,552
Intruder alert. Come with me.

628
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:08,781
Well, well...

629
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:10,282
what do we have here?

630
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:18,749
SISKO:<i> Captain's Log, Tactical Update,</i>
<i>Stardate 51149.5.</i>

631
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:21,168
<i>The </i>Defiant <i>has returned</i>
<i>to Starbase 375</i>

632
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:24,755
<i>after its successful attack</i>
<i>on the Dominion sensor array.</i>

633
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,590
<i>Admiral Ross and I have recommended</i>

634
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,759
<i>that Commander Dax </i>
<i>and the entire </i>Defiant <i>crew</i>

635
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:31,887
<i>be cited for exceptional</i>
<i>performance of their duties.</i>

636
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:34,932
NOG: Admiral on deck!

637
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,267
Carry on.

638
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,727
Nog, Saurian brandy for the brass.

639
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:42,940
Dax, could you tell Ensign Kirby
how I took over the con

640
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:45,526
when Lieutenant Haj was injured?
She doesn't believe me.

641
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,320
Frankly, I'm not sure I believe
it happened myself.

642
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,613
( Sisko clears throat )

643
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:50,948
Sir. Sir.

644
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:54,368
Congratulations, Captain.

645
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,829
Thank you, sir.
Will you excuse me a minute?

646
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:58,789
-Julian needs me.
-ADMIRAL: Certainly.

647
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,793
Here you are.

648
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:04,462
Don't ask where he got it.

649
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:08,007
Don't worry.
I don't want to know.

650
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,093
( door opens )

651
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,054
O'BRIEN:
Here's another one, Captain.

652
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:24,482
Take a good look...

653
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:28,986
because this says something about us,
that we're willing to fight

654
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:33,365
and that we'll keep on fighting
until we can't fight anymore.

655
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:34,950
CREW: Yes, sir!

656
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:37,495
You don't throw something like this away.

657
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:38,996
CREW: No, sir!

658
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:50,925
Hear, hear.

659
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,931
-They're a good crew.
-The best.

660
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:03,312
What do you say
we get back to work?

661
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:37,471
What the hell happened?
Why didn't you disable that alarm?

662
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,683
It's difficult to explain.

663
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:43,352
Rom is sitting in a holding
cell being interrogated.

664
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:46,647
He was counting on you.
I was counting on you!

665
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,191
-I know.
-You know?

666
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,610
Do you realize
what you just did?

667
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:54,863
You just handed the Alpha
Quadrant to the Dominion.

668
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,615
I was in the Link.

669
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:59,618
Are you saying you forgot?

670
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:01,078
I didn't forget.

671
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,581
It just... didn't seem to matter.

672
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:08,419
A lot of people are going to die.
Don't you care?

673
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,339
It has nothing to do with me.

674
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:15,593
How can you say that?

675
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:22,891
If you could experience the Link
you'd know why nothing else matters.

676
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:30,024
The last five years, your life here,
our friendship, none of that matters?

677
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,984
It did... once.

678
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:37,823
I wish I could
make you understand but you can't.

679
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:40,200
You're not a changeling.

680
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:42,786
You're right.

681
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:45,623
I'm a solid.

682
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:55,633
( door opens, closes )

683
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,974
You look troubled, Odo.

684
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,352
Did she upset you?

685
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:12,816
No, not really.

686
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,236
Ah.
