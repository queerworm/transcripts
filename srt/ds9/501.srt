1
00:00:02,628 --> 00:00:06,214
<i>Last time on</i>
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine...

2
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:07,424
(<i> groaning</i> )

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,302
Odo! What's wrong?

4
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:12,721
I... I don't know.

5
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:15,056
(<i> yelling in pain</i> )

6
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:23,691
I think you did this to me.

7
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:26,318
You killed a changeling, Odo.

8
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:29,571
That's why we forced you
to return home...

9
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:33,158
to enter the Great Link
and be judged.

10
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,378
What have you done to him?

11
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,045
We made him a solid.

12
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:47,923
He's one of you now.

13
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:49,008
Captain...

14
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:50,801
I'm reading a heart...

15
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,135
lungs...

16
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,470
and a digestive system.

17
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,306
It's as if he
were... human.

18
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,684
...will be considered
the enemy and fired upon.

19
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,602
Captain...
it's him.

20
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,771
Gowron?
What about him?

21
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,523
During the Link,

22
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:06,650
I sensed that the
other changelings

23
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,944
were trying to hide
things from me--

24
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:12,698
faces, names...

25
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:15,034
one of them was him.

26
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:16,660
What are you saying?

27
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:21,248
I'm saying
that he's one of<i> them.</i>

28
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:25,627
Gowron, the head
of the Klingon Empire

29
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,796
is a changeling.

30
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,226
(<i> sighing</i> )

31
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,728
Where are they?

32
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:44,855
They should've been back
hours ago.

33
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,732
Maybe the meeting
with Starfleet Command

34
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:48,734
took longer
than they thought it would.

35
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:50,945
Why haven't Sisko or Dax
contacted us?

36
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:52,780
Well, the whole area
they're traveling through

37
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,074
is crawling with
Klingon ships.

38
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:57,952
The second they use their
subspace transmitter
they become a target.

39
00:01:57,952 --> 00:02:00,537
I never should've let them
leave in a runabout.

40
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,790
I should've insisted that
they take the<i> Defiant.</i>

41
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,792
You did.
But the Captain's
orders were clear.

42
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,794
As long as we're at war
with the Klingons,

43
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:08,879
we need the<i> Defiant</i> here
to help protect the station.

44
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,172
All I know is, I'd hate to be
dodging Klingon raiding parties

45
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,758
in nothing but a runabout.

46
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,718
It would take a fleet
of Klingon ships

47
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:17,679
to breach
the station's defenses.

48
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,099
I say we take
the<i> Defiant</i>
and go look for them.

49
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:22,350
I'm with Worf.

50
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,104
Glad the two of you
are in agreement.

51
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:27,397
But, with the Captain gone,
<i>I</i> am in charge
of the station,

52
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,024
and I say we stay.

53
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:32,861
You may be in charge
of the station, Major,

54
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,529
but I command
the<i> Defiant.</i>

55
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,824
Mr. Worf, the Captain
has given us our orders

56
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:40,201
and I intend for us
to follow them until
he issues new ones.

57
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,788
O'BRIEN: Hold on a minute.
I'm reading a warp signature

58
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,289
approaching the station.

59
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,836
It is the<i> Rio Grande.</i>
On screen.

60
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,548
Looks like they had a run-in
with some Klingons.

61
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:56,175
Weapons systems,
shields and com system

62
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:57,678
are all pretty
shot up.

63
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,013
Life signs?

64
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:01,723
Two: one human, one Trill.

65
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:06,145
Permission to welcome
the Captain back on board.

66
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:07,688
Permission granted.

67
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,150
(<i> sighing</i> )

68
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,369
Glad you made it
back in one piece.
So are we.

69
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,496
How was your meeting
with Starfleet Command?

70
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,498
I'm afraid the war
is not going very well.

71
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:28,792
The Klingons are throwing
everything they have at us.

72
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:32,337
Starfleet's been able
to slow them down,
but that's about all.

73
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:35,757
It's hard to believe
one changeling could
cause so much chaos.

74
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,259
He can if he's
impersonating the leader
of the Klingon Empire.

75
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,095
So is Starfleet going
to do something

76
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,763
about Chancellor
Gowron or not?

77
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,390
Oh, they're going
to do something.

78
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,433
Starfleet's sending
an infiltration team

79
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,894
to Klingon territory.

80
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:49,021
Their orders are
to do whatever it takes

81
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:51,190
to prove that Gowron's
a shape-shifter.

82
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,650
Tough assignment.

83
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,027
Who are they sending?

84
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,113
Me.

85
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:09,995
Captain, you're just
in time for Happy Hour.

86
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:11,663
Do I look happy, Quark?

87
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,332
You think any of these
people looked happy

88
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:15,125
when they walked in here?

89
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,878
How could they?
There's a war going on.

90
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,547
But they come because they know
I'll do everything in my power

91
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,423
to help them forget
their troubles.

92
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,343
For a reasonable fee, of course.

93
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:26,427
Now, what can I do for you?

94
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,680
I'm looking for Odo.

95
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,142
Oh, Captain, we all have our
failures, and he's mine.

96
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,353
Ever since he lost his
shape-shifting abilities,

97
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:36,479
I haven't been able to get
a smile out of him.

98
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,397
Where is he?
I'm telling
you, Captain,

99
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:40,984
that's one depressed
ex-changeling.

100
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,444
He's upstairs
at his usual table.

101
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,488
Just follow
the black cloud.

102
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,579
Constable.

103
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:53,747
Listen, Captain...

104
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,499
do you hear it?

105
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,545
(<i> fizzing</i> )

106
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,381
You mean the bubbles?

107
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,759
Soothing,
isn't it?

108
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,969
You know,
before I became a solid,

109
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,763
I never heard that.

110
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,933
I had no sense of taste

111
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:16,436
so I never paid much attention
to food or drink.

112
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:20,148
I had no idea
how seductive they could be.

113
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:27,781
Ah...

114
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:32,535
Would you like me
to get you a glass?

115
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,495
I'm on duty.

116
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:37,749
I'm not.

117
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,751
I thought you were
always on duty.

118
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,128
Mm...

119
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:45,840
You know, at first,

120
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,011
I found the whole process
of ingestion disgusting.

121
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,972
But now that I've
gotten used to it,

122
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,015
I find eating
and drinking

123
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,892
to be quite
comforting.

124
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:59,062
It's one of the few things
that you...

125
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,192
that<i> we...</i>

126
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,153
humanoids...

127
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,238
have control over.

128
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,489
Not necessarily.

129
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,532
There's always the temptation

130
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:14,328
to eat too much,
to drink too much.

131
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:21,418
One has to find something
to do with one's time.

132
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:24,212
For some reason,
my work isn't as...

133
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,881
fulfilling as it used to be.

134
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:30,385
I might be able to do
something about that.

135
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,846
Starfleet has ordered us

136
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,056
to try to expose
the Gowron changeling.

137
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,766
I want you to come with us.

138
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,311
Hmm.

139
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:44,524
Maybe it would be better
for you to take Deputy Yndar.

140
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,028
There's nothing I can do
that he can't.

141
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,405
I don't need Yndar.
I need you.

142
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:59,164
What you need is someone
who can turn into Gowron's
pet<i> targ.</i>

143
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,082
I can't do that anymore.

144
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:05,045
What I need
is my Chief of Security.

145
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,297
There will be a staff meeting
at 1600 hours.

146
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,882
I expect you to be there.

147
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,266
According
to Starfleet Intelligence

148
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,851
Chancellor Gowron has relocated

149
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:22,896
Klingon military headquarters
to Ty'Gokor.

150
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,315
That will make our job
more difficult.

151
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,608
Ty'Gokor is located
in an asteroid field

152
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,903
deep in Klingon space.

153
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:33,656
It is probably the most heavily
fortified installation
in the Empire.

154
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,451
There are at least 30 warships
stationed there

155
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:39,037
at any given time,
and the entire asteroid field

156
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,581
is protected
by a tachyon detection grid.

157
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,458
O'BRIEN:
Which means there's no way

158
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,544
we can get a cloaked ship
within transporter range.

159
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:47,379
Even if we do find
a way inside,

160
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,964
getting close to Gowron
will not be easy.

161
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:53,260
He is guarded around the clock
by his personal security force,

162
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,635
the<i> Yan-Isleth.</i>

163
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,346
The Brotherhood of the Sword.

164
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,348
KIRA:
Look, I don't want
to sound negative

165
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,517
but even if you do
get to Gowron,

166
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:03,520
how are you going to
prove to the Klingons
he's a changeling?

167
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,355
I doubt he's going
to stand still

168
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,107
and let us take
a blood sample.

169
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,276
Klingons are obsessive
about blood screenings.

170
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:12,195
If he's lasted this long,
the changeling
impersonating Gowron

171
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,988
must've already found
a way around them.

172
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,366
There is another option.

173
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,368
We could kill him.

174
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,996
Dead changelings do revert
to their gelatinous state.

175
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:27,419
Our orders are to expose Gowron,
not assassinate him.

176
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:33,967
Which is why Starfleet
has given us these.

177
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,145
Very impressive.
What are they?

178
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:48,482
They're modified
polaron emitters.

179
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:51,276
SISKO:
Starfleet Science
thinks that exposure

180
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:53,570
to polaron radiation
will have a destabilizing effect

181
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,196
on changeling physiology.

182
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,699
In other words,
if we use these on Gowron

183
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,743
and he is one of my people,

184
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,413
he won't be able to retain
his humanoid shape.

185
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:06,541
That's the theory.
The problem is,
for it to work properly,

186
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,169
you have to activate
all four emitters at once.

187
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,338
With this.

188
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,131
I hate prototypes.

189
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:16,301
Plus, too much polaron radiation
can be fatal,

190
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:19,220
which means we can only expose
a person once.

191
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,264
Any more than that,
changeling or not,

192
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,766
and they could die
from radiation poisoning.

193
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,685
The plan is to smuggle these
into Ty'Gokor.

194
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:30,398
Once they're set up, they can
cover about 12,000 cubic meters.

195
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,526
So, let me get this straight.

196
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:35,278
All we have to do
is get past an enemy fleet,

197
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,238
avoid a tachyon detection grid,

198
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,240
beam into the middle
of Klingon headquarters,

199
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,201
and avoid the Brotherhood
of the Sword

200
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,286
long enough to set these things
up and activate them

201
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:44,745
in front of Gowron.

202
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,540
If we succeed...

203
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,042
there will be many songs sung
in our honor.

204
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,002
Let's hope we're there
to hear them.

205
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,753
Well, the first problem

206
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,298
is how to get you safely
to Ty'Gokor.

207
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:58,677
That's one I think I can solve.

208
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,856
Major, I must say
I'm shocked.

209
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,442
You use my daughter
to lure me here,

210
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,486
you're asking me
to risk my ship

211
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:19,698
on some fool's errand
into the Klingon Empire,

212
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,991
and you're pregnant.

213
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,035
I hope First
Minister Shakaar

214
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:26,996
appreciates what
a lucky man he is.

215
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,416
Shakaar's not the father.

216
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,000
But then who is?

217
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,960
Chief O'Brien.

218
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,470
Promenade.

219
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:49,018
Well, at least
there's one good thing
about your condition.

220
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,187
You won't be going
on this suicidal mission.

221
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,064
It may not be
as hopeless
as you think.

222
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:55,316
How can Sisko
be so deluded

223
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,569
to think that he and
three of his crewmen

224
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:00,614
can infiltrate Klingon
military headquarters?

225
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,907
They'll be caught
in a heartbeat.

226
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,492
Maybe...

227
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,958
maybe not.

228
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,257
What's wrong, Dukat?

229
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:22,469
Haven't you ever seen
a Klingon before?

230
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,682
(<i> laughing</i> )

231
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,906
I see we're all here.

232
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,159
The ship is ready
for departure, sir.

233
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,495
At your convenience, Gul Dukat.

234
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,163
Captain, I insist we make

235
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:53,708
a holographic record
of the four of you.

236
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:58,045
Consider it payment in full
for the use of my vessel.

237
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,547
Maybe<i> after</i> the mission.

238
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,257
After the mission,
you'll all be dead.

239
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:06,179
Damar, let's not spoil
this special moment

240
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,807
with predictions of doom.

241
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:11,142
Even you have to appreciate

242
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:15,938
the... audacity
of Captain Sisko's plan.

243
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,940
Personally, I think
we'd be better off

244
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,694
launching an orbital assault
on Gowron's Command Center.

245
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,570
A full spread
of photon torpedoes

246
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,656
would take care of him,
the Klingon High Command

247
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:26,866
and everyone else within
a few hundred kilometers.

248
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,994
Ha! You should ask Dukat
for some shore leave.

249
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,330
I think you've been
in space too long.

250
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,415
(<i> laughing</i> )
Why?

251
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,626
Because I'm willing
to spill a little Klingon blood

252
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:38,085
to get
the job done?

253
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,546
O'BRIEN:
Shelling Ty'Gokor

254
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,088
won't get the job done.

255
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,841
You'd be lucky
to launch one torpedo

256
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:44,425
before they
shot you down.

257
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,678
Besides, even a dozen
won't penetrate

258
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:48,471
the shielding around
the Command Center.

259
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,682
Thank you for your input,
Mr. Damar,

260
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:53,434
but we'll stick
to the original plan.

261
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,688
Have you made any progress
with our Klingon identity files?

262
00:14:56,688 --> 00:15:00,149
Oh, don't worry, Captain.
By the time we get to Ty'Gokor,

263
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,485
we'll have something
suitably impressive

264
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,863
to plant in their central
computer system.

265
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:06,906
Our names should be added
to the list of candidates

266
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,700
for the Order
of the<i> Bat'leth.</i>

267
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,703
"The Order
of the<i> Bat'leth"?</i>

268
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,831
Don't you think
you might be overdoing it?

269
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:18,000
They'll be inducting some
new members in a few days,

270
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,421
and Chancellor Gowron
will be presiding
over the ceremony.

271
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:25,633
That should make
for a very interesting evening.

272
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,893
Here are the results
of the crew physicals.

273
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:36,728
Ah. Anything
interesting?

274
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:39,313
Lieutenant Vilix'pran
is budding again.

275
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,775
You're kidding.
How many will this make?

276
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:44,485
Oh, let's see now--
he had two from
the last litter...

277
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:48,114
four before that--
could be anywhere
from eight to 18.

278
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,074
He'll need bigger
quarters again.

279
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,201
He said the request
will be on your desk
in the morning.

280
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:55,162
(<i> sighs</i> ):
Eighteen?!

281
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,290
I just hope
I can survive<i> one.</i>

282
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,251
You're doing great.
Oh, I don't feel great.

283
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,629
You're...
positively glowing.

284
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,672
Oh, really?

285
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,091
I think so, but then
I suppose my opinion

286
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,968
doesn't
really count.

287
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,429
Oh, it counts,
but don't forget--

288
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,973
<i>this</i> is still
your fault.

289
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,809
<i>My</i> fault?!

290
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,894
You performed the transfer
from Keiko to me.

291
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,312
After you
volunteered.

292
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,105
After you put
the idea in my head.

293
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,399
After you flew the runabout
into an asteroid field.

294
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,402
After you insisted
we check on those
anomalous bio-scans.

295
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,655
That was Keiko!
That's right, it was,

296
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:29,948
but I'd rather blame<i> you!</i>

297
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,574
Whatever makes
you happy.

298
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,451
I never argue with my patients

299
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:36,078
or my commanding officer.

300
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:43,002
You think they'll make it?

301
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,545
They'll make it.

302
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:48,675
Question is:

303
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:51,427
Will you be able to give them
their old faces back?

304
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:02,104
We shall start
with you.

305
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,274
I am waiting.

306
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,986
I don't understand.

307
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:10,029
I am not interested
in excuses.

308
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,572
Are you a Klingon warrior

309
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,240
or an Alverian dung beetle?

310
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,494
I really don't see the point...

311
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,120
Do not look away from me.

312
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,289
I called you a dung beetle.
I heard you.

313
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,749
And what is your response?

314
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,835
You should have
your eyes examined.

315
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:25,419
(<i> chuckling</i> )

316
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:31,718
This is not going to work.

317
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,679
It is not enough
to look like a Klingon--

318
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:38,057
one must act like one.

319
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,351
Perhaps it is
better if I went...

320
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,602
(<i> yells</i> )

321
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,437
Are you questioning

322
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,732
the validity of my plan?!

323
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,692
Very convincing, Captain.

324
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:49,652
But was it your intention
to challenge me

325
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:52,279
to a battle to the death?
No, not at all.

326
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,908
Then next time,
do not strike me with
the back of your hand.

327
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:56,200
Use your fist.

328
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,747
This is more complicated
than I thought.

329
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:03,708
You should think twice
before insulting
a Klingon like that.

330
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,251
What did I do?
Look at you--

331
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,211
you stand so far
away from me.

332
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,922
You speak so softly.

333
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:10,381
Are you afraid of me

334
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,425
or just disgusted
by my presence?

335
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,137
(<i> shouting</i> ):
Klingon warriors speak
proudly to each other!

336
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:21,017
They do not whisper
or keep their distance!

337
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,435
Sorry!

338
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,228
(<i> growls</i> )

339
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,940
I'll do better next time.

340
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,943
Keep practicing.

341
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,748
Constable?

342
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,541
Captain...

343
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,086
I have no business
being on this mission.

344
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:50,546
I'm not a very
convincing Klingon.

345
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,465
Then you better work
on becoming one

346
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,842
because, like it or not,
you<i> are</i>  on this mission.

347
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,928
I'd hate to be
the reason it fails.

348
00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:59,430
Let me worry about that.

349
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,974
(<i> sighs</i> )

350
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:08,355
Odo... I know this has been
a difficult time for you--

351
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:12,902
that you would have never
chosen to become a solid--

352
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:16,405
but what's done is done.

353
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,909
Brooding about it
isn't going to change anything

354
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:22,369
and shirking
your responsibilities

355
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:25,539
isn't going to make you feel
better about yourself.

356
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:29,794
No...

357
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,755
I don't suppose it will.

358
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,343
Then I suggest
you get back in there

359
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,803
and do your job.

360
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:45,476
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

361
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,439
What's going on, Dukat?

362
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,317
We're being hailed
by another bird-of-prey.

363
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,069
ODO:
What are you
doing about it?

364
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:57,488
We're hailing them back.

365
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:59,782
I wouldn't worry--
this happens all the time.

366
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,826
DAMAR:
Sir, they're requesting
visual contact.

367
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,285
By all means.

368
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,454
It's a shame
you can't see

369
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,581
the holo-image I'm projecting
over the com system.

370
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,834
I make quite an
imposing Klingon.

371
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:12,045
Sir, the holo-filter's
not working.

372
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,713
What do you mean
it's not working?

373
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:16,174
Let me take a look at it.

374
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:19,135
Sir, they're repeating
the request.

375
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:21,721
The optronic relays
are fused.

376
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,764
Maybe Worf should
speak to them.

377
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,265
I might be able to convince...

378
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,851
I have a better idea.

379
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,235
You should have
let me speak to them.

380
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,612
Was that really necessary?!
It was either that,

381
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,240
or trust in Mr. Worf's
ability to lie,

382
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,617
and frankly, I have
more faith in my weapons.

383
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:46,954
Get us out of here, Damar.

384
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,707
I want to put as much distance
between us

385
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,500
and that wreckage as possible.

386
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,234
I hope I remember how
to set this thing up.

387
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:18,527
If that is a joke,
I am not amused.

388
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,988
It's not easy being funny
wearing these teeth.

389
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:25,159
Well, Captain, I've enjoyed
your company as always,

390
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:27,453
but it appears it is time
we said good-bye.

391
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:30,623
I don't envy your assignment.

392
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,792
Orbiting this place
for the next day or so

393
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:36,336
won't be the safest job
in the galaxy either.

394
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:39,590
Which is why we'll be leaving
as soon as you beam down.

395
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,301
Leaving? For how long?

396
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,263
I really don't see
any pressing need to come back.

397
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:46,973
That's not what we agreed to.

398
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:49,058
I realize that.

399
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:51,852
But how long do you think
we can stay here undetected

400
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,105
without the holo-filter?

401
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:56,523
Besides, if you succeed,

402
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:59,318
the war will be over
and you won't need us.

403
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,446
And if you fail...

404
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:10,788
Did you add our names
to the Commendation List?

405
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:15,375
I haven't survived this long
by being sloppy, Mr. Worf.

406
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,005
And now...

407
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:22,633
Jodmos, son of Kobor...

408
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:25,427
your medal awaits you.

409
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:35,604
<i>Cho'Ghos!</i>

410
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:45,281
(<i> boisterous voices</i>
<i>and laughter</i> )

411
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:59,962
(<i> singing in Klingon</i> )

412
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,263
Oh.

413
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:10,806
(<i> growls</i> )

414
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:13,893
(<i> laughing</i> )

415
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,435
(<i> chuckles halfheartedly</i> )

416
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,730
You all right?

417
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,439
I'm fine.

418
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,859
I just wish they'd stop
ringing that bell.

419
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,320
(<i> laughs</i> )

420
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:29,325
The Hall of Warriors.

421
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:33,537
You can smell the blood
of history in these stones.

422
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:36,040
Come. We must celebrate.

423
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,499
<i>t'QaH!</i>

424
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,627
Now what?

425
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:43,797
Now... we celebrate!

426
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,716
(<i> approving grunts</i> )

427
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:57,603
How's the view?

428
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:00,856
You know, you can tell a lot
about people's moods

429
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,441
just by watching them walk
on the Promenade.

430
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:07,487
When things are going good,
people take their time...

431
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:11,200
window shop,
talk to their friends.

432
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,745
(<i> sighs</i> ):
And then there's days
like today.

433
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:16,663
Everybody's in a hurry.

434
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:20,084
They can feel the Klingons
breathing down their necks.

435
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:24,546
Well, I shall have to remember
to walk a little slower.

436
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,967
"Show no fear."
That's my motto.

437
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:30,386
KIRA:
Ops to Dr. Bashir.

438
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:32,596
Go ahead, Major.
Report to the Infirmary.

439
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,640
The<i> Armstrong</i> and
the<i> Drake</i>  were ambushed

440
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,683
by a Klingon battle group
and they took heavy casualties.

441
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,560
They'll be docking
in a few minutes.

442
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,895
I'm on my way.

443
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:44,442
Your father's going
to be all right, Jake.

444
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,569
I suppose.

445
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:50,948
But sometimes I wish that
he wasn't so good at his job.

446
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:53,367
That way, maybe
every once in a while

447
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:55,911
they'd give someone else
the tough assignments.

448
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,871
He goes where he's sent.

449
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:00,249
It's all a part
of wearing the uniform,

450
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:02,876
and I doubt that's
ever going to change.

451
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:16,890
KLINGON:
I was the first
to board their starship.

452
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,517
With one blow
from my<i> Bat'leth,</i>

453
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:23,856
I beheaded their helmsman,
a Tellarite.

454
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:28,777
The pig didn't even have time
to raise his weapon.

455
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:32,281
Well, then, I turned
my attention to the Captain,

456
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:34,658
a Benzenite named Laporin.

457
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:38,954
Ah,<i> he</i> put up
a valiant struggle,

458
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:43,625
but in the end,
I ripped the breathing tubes
from his head and...

459
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,002
(<i> imitates slicing sound</i> )

460
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:46,712
(<i> laughing</i> )

461
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,886
Brag all you want,

462
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:58,057
but don't get between me
and the bloodwine!

463
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:00,017
(<i> laughing and cheering</i> )

464
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:04,188
KLINGON:
<i>Qapla'!</i>

465
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,403
You knew
Captain Laporin?

466
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:12,612
We went to the
Academy together.

467
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:14,865
How long before
Gowron gets here?

468
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:17,034
Many hours.
He will not appear

469
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:19,203
until tomorrow morning,
at the earliest.

470
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:21,705
This is...
an endurance test

471
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,790
as much as it is
a celebration.

472
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,959
It's part of
the Initiation Rite for
the Order of the<i> Bat'leth.</i>

473
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:29,463
The idea is to eat, drink,
stay awake all night

474
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:32,632
and still be clear-eyed when
Gowron arrives for the ceremony.

475
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,801
So, when do we set up
the emitters?

476
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:37,430
Not until morning.
I don't want to take the chance

477
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:40,266
of anyone spotting them
once they're in place.

478
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:43,394
In that case, we might
as well drink up.

479
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:47,523
(<i> sighing</i> ):
It's a pity it doesn't
have any bubbles.

480
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:49,483
(<i> chuckling</i> )

481
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,910
(<i> loud laughter</i> )

482
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:05,082
(<i> grunting</i> )

483
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:17,261
You know, I think I'm actually
beginning to like bloodwine.

484
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:21,890
It's really not too bad,
except for the taste.

485
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,519
Just be thankful
the anti-intoxicant we took
is still working.

486
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:28,939
Or you would be so drunk
you would not be able to stand.

487
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:35,653
(<i> grunts</i> )
(<i> chuckling</i> )

488
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:44,121
Not bad.

489
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:47,458
Captain of the Academy
wrestling team...

490
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:49,667
22 years ago.

491
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,170
Ow!

492
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:53,797
KLINGON:
General Martok!

493
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,257
Martok!

494
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:56,800
Hail Martok!

495
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,010
(<i> cheering</i> )

496
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,845
The General!

497
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:01,347
(<i> cheering</i> )

498
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:02,640
Captain.

499
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,724
I see him.

500
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:12,941
What if he recognizes us?

501
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,361
Then we'll have come
a long way for nothing.

502
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:17,571
(<i> cheering continues</i> )

503
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:31,877
<i>Qapla'.</i>
<i>Qapla'.</i>

504
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:33,587
<i>Qapla'.</i>
<i>Qapla'.</i>

505
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,256
<i>Qapla'.</i>

506
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:42,680
If Martok is here,
Gowron will not be
far behind.

507
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,390
Let's get it done.

508
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:19,466
Hold on there.

509
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:23,721
Don't I know you?

510
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:26,599
I would be honored
to think so.

511
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,434
I know we have met.

512
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:31,562
I am Pahash
of the House of Konjah.

513
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:34,231
The name is not
familiar to me,

514
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:37,067
but there is
something about you...

515
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:40,362
Perhaps we met
on the battlefield.

516
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:43,240
My regiment fought
at Mempa.

517
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,950
Mempa!

518
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,911
Many noble deeds were
done on that dark day.

519
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,372
And yours
have become legend.

520
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:52,916
Mempa...
yes, that must be it.

521
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,961
After the ceremony, would you
honor me with a drink?

522
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:58,589
We will salute the fallen.

523
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:01,341
There is something...

524
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:05,011
very familiar
about this face.

525
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:09,182
(<i> grunts</i> )

526
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,780
Hey, where's Gowron?

527
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,374
What is this?

528
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,387
Get away from me or you
won't live to see Gowron.

529
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:32,974
I'll take that.

530
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,934
This looks like
some sort of weapon.

531
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:37,312
Kodrak, my brother!

532
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,689
Ah, you found it.

533
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:40,399
Found what?

534
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,776
It is a tinghamut.

535
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:44,236
A what?

536
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:46,864
A Vulcan toy
for children.

537
00:31:46,864 --> 00:31:50,242
The spoils of war
from the raid on Archanis.

538
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,828
If you want one,
you will have
to find your own.

539
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:54,830
Give this to your son.

540
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,623
I'll make sure
he gets it.

541
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,041
(<i> cheering</i> )

542
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,753
Hail Gowron!

543
00:32:00,753 --> 00:32:02,546
Gowron!

544
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:04,214
Gowron!

545
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:22,691
Long live Gowron!

546
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:24,943

00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:30,741
Klingon warriors,
I salute you!

549
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:34,202
At least those of you
still on your feet.

550

(<i> laughing</i> )

551
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:41,126
This is a great day
for the Empire,

552
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:45,004
a day when we honor you
who have brought us glory,

553
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:50,385
whose deeds of valor
will live on in song and story!

554
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,262
(<i> cheering</i> )

555
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:56,349
And so, now, here,
in this hallowed hall,

556
00:32:56,349 --> 00:33:00,103
under the watchful gaze
of our greatest heroes

557
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,814
you will receive
the highest honor

558
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:04,775
that can be bestowed
upon a Klingon--

559
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:07,527
the Order
of the<i> Bat'leth!</i>

560
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,195
(<i> all cheering</i> )

561
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,364
(<i> chanting</i> ):
Gowron! Gowron!

562
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:12,491
Gowron!

563
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:21,959
Come forward, H'Ta,
son of Kahmar.

564
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:34,471
Glory to you

565
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:36,515
and your House.

566
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:45,482
This is my place!
Step down.

567
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:46,984
Find another.

568
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:48,861
MARTOK:
Come forward, T'Vis,

569
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:50,069
son of Barot.

570
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,738
(<i> cheering</i> )

571
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,617
That won't be necessary.

572
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:59,788
GOWRON: Glory to you
and your House.

573
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:03,876
Come forward, Huss,
daughter of Altrom.

574
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,634
KLINGON:
She brings honor to our House!

575
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:15,971
zGOWRON:
Glory to you

576
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:17,890
and your House.

577
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,477
Come forward, Jodmos,

578
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,229
son of Kobor.

579
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,940
(<i> cheering</i> )

580
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,509
Glory to you

581
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:57,012
and your House.

582
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:16,448
Captain Benjamin Sisko.

583
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:19,076
I knew I recognized
that face.

584
00:35:19,076 --> 00:35:20,410
Seal the room!

585
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:27,960
It seems we have
some uninvited guests.

586
00:35:37,094 --> 00:35:39,137
MARTOK:
Captain, you have no idea

587
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:42,515
how much I've looked forward
to killing you in battle.

588
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:45,727
And now your foolishness
has cheated me
of that pleasure.

589
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:48,396
I'm sorry
to disappoint you.

590
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,439
(<i> growls</i> )

591
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:50,690
Leave us.

592
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,485
You heard me!

593
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,245
(<i> quietly</i> ):
Don't you understand?

594
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:06,790
You've thrown your lives away
for nothing.

595
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:10,002
Or did you really think you
could fool us into believing

596
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:12,545
that Chancellor Gowron
was a Dominion spy?

597
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:14,673
Gowron is the one
who's fooling you.

598
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,633
And as long as you follow him,

599
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:18,969
the Empire will be nothing
but a pawn of the Founders.

600
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:20,595
Where's your proof?!

601
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,973
You want proof?
Take our polaron emitters

602
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:24,432
and use them on Gowron.

603
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:27,519
Gowron had your
equipment destroyed.

604
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:29,270
O'BRIEN:
Of course he did.

605
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,439
He had to make sure
he couldn't be tested.

606
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:34,860
Captain, your mission
was a failure.

607
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,528
For that, you deserve to die.

608
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,613
Would you be happier
if we'd succeeded?

609
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:41,992
I am a loyal officer
of the Empire.

610
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:48,623
You think we're right,
don't you?

611
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:51,417
You believe that Gowron
is a changeling, too.

612
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:52,836
That would be treason!

613
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:54,587
Since when
is it treasonous

614
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:57,174
to act in the best interests
of the Empire?

615
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:01,761
How long have you suspected?

616
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:05,223
Months.

617
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:08,643
I've known Gowron
a long time,

618
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:12,064
and it is no secret
that we have not always agreed

619
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:14,066
on the way he runs the Empire.

620
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:16,026
He is a politician.

621
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:19,696
Too eager to compromise,
too eager to talk.

622
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:22,032
Last year, he stopped the attack
on Deep Space 9

623
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:24,576
instead of going to war
with the Federation,

624
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,036
and then he changed.

625
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:29,288
Suddenly, he was the one
calling for war.

626
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:31,249
I would've thought that
would make you happy.

627
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:34,502
At first it did.
But after the war began,

628
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:37,463
he started ignoring
the counsel of his generals

629
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:40,217
throwing aside all wisdom
in his pursuit of victory.

630
00:37:40,217 --> 00:37:43,845
Our losses continue to mount

631
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:45,555
and still he listens to no one.

632
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:47,515
No one but the Founders.

633
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:52,062
There is only one certain way

634
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:54,773
to expose Gowron
for what he really is.

635
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:56,691
To prove beyond
a shadow of a doubt

636
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,151
that he is a changeling.

637
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:03,656
Gowron... must die.

638
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:06,826
Once he's dead, he'll revert
to his natural form

639
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,745
and all doubt
will be eliminated.

640
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:11,706
DYou could challenge him
to honorable combat.

641
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,833
There will be
no honorable combat

642
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,461
no formal challenges.

643
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:18,922
I will release you
and help you reach

644
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:21,967
the Hall of Warriors

645
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:24,177
and then...

646
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:27,139
you will kill him.

647
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,310
(<i> pounding</i> )

648
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:37,398
The prisoners will come with me
for further interrogation.

649
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:40,068
General, I have strict orders
from Gowron himself.

650
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:42,528
The prisoners are not
to leave this cell.

651
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:44,322
I see.

652
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,242
Well, we wouldn't want
to disobey the Chancellor.

653
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:53,206
Follow me.

654
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,920
What? Another toast?

655
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,299
Then let us salute
Rurik the Damned

656
00:39:02,299 --> 00:39:06,219
conqueror of the Zora Fel,
liberator of Vrax.

657
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:18,148
For the Empire.

658
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:19,232
Let's go.

659
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:23,945
Not you.

660
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:27,448
There's no telling where
your loyalties lie.

661
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:36,666
What is this?

662
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,459
It is your death!

663
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,053
No!

664
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:50,347
Lower your weapons.

665
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:52,390
If this traitor
wants a fight,

666
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,600
I will give him one.

667
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,353
You want to kill me, Worf?

668
00:39:56,353 --> 00:39:58,355
You're welcome to try.

669
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:10,950
What are they doing?

670
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,370
Why doesn't Sisko
just shoot him?

671
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:17,290
I have a better question.
Why isn't Gowron letting
his bodyguards kill Worf?

672
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,959
I'll tell you why.
Klingon honor.

673
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,212
A concept you should
be very familiar with.

674
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:24,923
My people, on the other hand
don't care about honor.

675
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:28,051
How did you put it?
"There will be
no honorable combat,

676
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:29,635
no formal challenges."

677
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,346
Hardly the words
of a Klingon.

678
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:33,056
Tell me,<i> General,</i>

679
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:35,975
did Gowron destroy
the polaron emitters,

680
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,936
or did you?

681
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:55,536
(<i> growling</i> )

682
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:06,423
ODO:
Worf, stop!

683
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,808
Martok's the changeling!

684
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:47,630
Well, looks like we found
our changeling after all.

685
00:41:56,389 --> 00:42:00,018
So the Founders mislead Odo
into thinking I was a spy,

686
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:02,228
hoping that you'd eliminate me

687
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:05,064
and pave the way for that
<i>thing</i>  imitating Martok

688
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:07,066
to take over the Empire.

689
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:09,402
That way, the war
between the Federation
and the Klingons

690
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:12,197
would continue until
both sides were destroyed.

691
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:15,492
Leaving the Alpha Quadrant wide
open for a Dominion invasion.

692
00:42:15,492 --> 00:42:17,743
That seems to have been
their plan.

693
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,537
And we played right into it.

694
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:22,540
But they sorely
underestimated Odo here.

695
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,459
Thank you.

696
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:26,919
If we really want to strike
a blow against the Founders,

697
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:29,172
we have to find a way
to end this war.

698
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:31,549
That may not be possible.
WORF: Why not?

699
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,634
You told us
that the Martok changeling

700
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,636
was the one who pushed for
the attack on the Federation.

701
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:38,264
True, but if your Klingon blood
wasn't so thin,

702
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:40,183
you'd know
that once battle has begun

703
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:43,144
there can be no turning back.
You want the war to end?

704
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:45,563
Then the Federation
must allow us to annex Archanis

705
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,857
and the other worlds
we've seized.

706
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:51,110
I wouldn't count on that.

707
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:55,490
But if the fighting stops
and the negotiations begin...

708
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,616
Ah, yes. Talk.

709
00:42:57,616 --> 00:43:00,078
That's right-- talk.

710
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:02,663
The last thing
the Dominion wants.

711
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:12,048
I will call a meeting
of the High Council.

712
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:15,093
Advise a temporary
cease-fire.

713
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:17,636
Where Gowron leads,
the Council will follow.

714
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:21,807
Perhaps. I'll see
to it that you're
safely delivered

715
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:24,102
back to that space
station of yours.

716
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:25,853
I'd appreciate that.

717
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:31,901
You have done a great
service to the Empire.

718
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:33,528
For that, I thank you.

719
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:39,117
As for you...

720
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:42,203
you should have killed me
when you had the chance.

721
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:45,664
I promise
you won't get another.

722
00:43:57,552 --> 00:44:00,721
Now, that's better,
isn't it?

723
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:04,100
I don't know.
I could do without
the ridges, but...

724
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,977
I kind of miss
the fangs.

725
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:07,395
(<i> chuckles</i> )

726
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:09,188
Well, that
leaves you, Odo.

727
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,689
It's about time.

728
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:12,900
I, for one, won't miss
the fangs at all.

729
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,945
Well, you know,
Constable, I can give you
any face you like--

730
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:17,905
Bajoran, human, Trill.

731
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:20,825
My old face will do
very nicely, thank you.

732
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:22,494
You heard the man.

733
00:44:22,494 --> 00:44:24,203
Whatever you say.
