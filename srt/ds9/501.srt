1
00:00:02,698 --> 00:00:05,466
Last time on
<i>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine...</i>

2
00:00:07,745 --> 00:00:08,576
Odo!

3
00:00:08,614 --> 00:00:10,608
What's wrong?

4
00:00:10,653 --> 00:00:12,921
I... I don't know.

5
00:00:21,982 --> 00:00:23,953
I think you did this to me.

6
00:00:23,987 --> 00:00:26,619
You killed a changeling, Odo.

7
00:00:26,661 --> 00:00:29,965
That's why we forced you
to return home...

8
00:00:30,003 --> 00:00:33,467
to enter the Great Link
and be judged.

9
00:00:43,137 --> 00:00:44,697
What have you done to him?

10
00:00:44,741 --> 00:00:46,371
We made him a solid.

11
00:00:46,412 --> 00:00:48,280
He's one of you now.

12
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:49,410
Captain...

13
00:00:49,453 --> 00:00:51,013
I'm reading a heart...

14
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:52,527
lungs...

15
00:00:52,561 --> 00:00:54,464
and a digestive system.

16
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,768
It's as if he were... human.

17
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:58,777
...will be considered
the enemy and fired upon.

18
00:00:58,811 --> 00:00:59,780
Captain...

19
00:00:59,814 --> 00:01:01,181
it's him.

20
00:01:01,217 --> 00:01:02,949
Gowron?
What about him?

21
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:04,619
During the Link

22
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:06,653
I sensed
that the other changelings

23
00:01:06,698 --> 00:01:08,760
were trying
to hide things from me...

24
00:01:08,804 --> 00:01:12,507
faces, names...

25
00:01:12,547 --> 00:01:15,385
one of them was him.

26
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,118
What are you saying?

27
00:01:17,158 --> 00:01:21,261
I'm saying
that he's one of them.

28
00:01:21,303 --> 00:01:25,576
Gowron, the head
of the Klingon Empire

29
00:01:25,614 --> 00:01:28,679
is a changeling.

30
00:01:41,622 --> 00:01:43,182
Where are they?

31
00:01:43,226 --> 00:01:45,562
They should've been back
hours ago.

32
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,125
Maybe the meeting
with Starfleet Command

33
00:01:47,169 --> 00:01:49,072
took longer
than they thought it would.

34
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:51,512
Why haven't Sisko or Dax
contacted us?

35
00:01:51,548 --> 00:01:53,382
Well, the whole area
they're traveling through

36
00:01:53,452 --> 00:01:55,150
is crawling
with Klingon ships.

37
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,058
The second they use
their subspace transmitter

38
00:01:57,095 --> 00:01:58,496
they become a target.

39
00:01:58,532 --> 00:02:00,902
I never should've let them
leave in a runabout.

40
00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:03,309
I should've insisted
that they take the <i>Defiant.</i>

41
00:02:03,345 --> 00:02:04,336
You did.

42
00:02:04,381 --> 00:02:05,941
But the Captain's orders
were clear.

43
00:02:05,985 --> 00:02:07,352
As long as we're at war
with the Klingons

44
00:02:07,456 --> 00:02:09,359
we need the <i>Defiant</i> here
to help protect the station.

45
00:02:09,428 --> 00:02:12,026
All I know is, I'd hate to be
dodging Klingon raiding parties

46
00:02:12,068 --> 00:02:13,230
in nothing but a runabout.

47
00:02:13,271 --> 00:02:15,265
It would take a fleet
of Klingon ships

48
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:17,075
to breach
the station's defenses.

49
00:02:18,517 --> 00:02:20,511
I say we take the <i>Defiant</i>
and go look for them.

50
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,548
I'm with Worf.

51
00:02:23,197 --> 00:02:25,567
Glad the two of you
are in agreement.

52
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:28,075
But, with the Captain gone,
I am in charge of the station

53
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,545
and I say we stay.

54
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,249
You may be in charge
of the station, Major

55
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:34,884
but I command the <i>Defiant.</i>

56
00:02:34,926 --> 00:02:37,330
Mr. Worf, the Captain
has given us our orders

57
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:38,767
and I intend for us
to follow them

58
00:02:38,804 --> 00:02:39,864
until he issues new ones.

59
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:42,378
Hold on a minute.

60
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:44,783
I'm reading a warp signature
approaching the station.

61
00:02:47,325 --> 00:02:48,589
It is the <i>Rio Grande.</i>

62
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:49,620
On screen.

63
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,109
Looks like they had a run-in
with some Klingons.

64
00:02:54,143 --> 00:02:56,809
Weapons systems, shields
and com system

65
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:58,481
are all pretty shot up.

66
00:02:58,588 --> 00:02:59,487
Life signs?

67
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:02,257
Two: One human, one Trill.

68
00:03:04,604 --> 00:03:06,666
Permission to welcome
the Captain back on board.

69
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:08,703
Permission granted.

70
00:03:20,512 --> 00:03:22,142
Glad you made it
back in one piece.

71
00:03:22,183 --> 00:03:23,174
So are we.

72
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:24,917
How was your meeting
with Starfleet Command?

73
00:03:24,956 --> 00:03:27,018
I'm afraid the war
is not going very well.

74
00:03:27,062 --> 00:03:29,330
The Klingons are throwing
everything they have at us.

75
00:03:29,368 --> 00:03:31,236
Starfleet's been able
to slow them down

76
00:03:31,273 --> 00:03:33,039
but that's about all.

77
00:03:33,077 --> 00:03:34,137
It's hard to believe

78
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:36,175
one changeling
could cause so much chaos.

79
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:37,518
He can if he's impersonating

80
00:03:37,623 --> 00:03:39,287
the leader
of the Klingon Empire.

81
00:03:39,327 --> 00:03:40,728
So is Starfleet going
to do something

82
00:03:40,765 --> 00:03:42,429
about Chancellor Gowron or not?

83
00:03:42,468 --> 00:03:43,937
Oh, they're going
to do something.

84
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,101
Starfleet's sending

85
00:03:45,143 --> 00:03:47,479
an infiltration team
to Klingon territory.

86
00:03:47,515 --> 00:03:49,645
Their orders are
to do whatever it takes

87
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,784
to prove that Gowron's
a shape-shifter.

88
00:03:52,863 --> 00:03:54,059
Tough assignment.

89
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:55,625
Who are they sending?

90
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:58,737
Me.

91
00:06:05,972 --> 00:06:08,604
Captain, you're just
in time for Happy Hour.

92
00:06:08,645 --> 00:06:10,046
Do I look happy, Quark?

93
00:06:10,082 --> 00:06:12,418
You think any of these people
looked happy

94
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,015
when they walked in here?

95
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,794
How could they?
There's a war going on.

96
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,567
But they come because they know
I'll do everything in my power

97
00:06:19,607 --> 00:06:21,237
to help them forget
their troubles.

98
00:06:21,278 --> 00:06:23,340
For a reasonable fee, of course.

99
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,513
Now, what can I do for you?

100
00:06:25,556 --> 00:06:27,048
I'm looking for Odo.

101
00:06:27,093 --> 00:06:30,899
Oh, Captain, we all have
our failures, and he's mine.

102
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,704
Ever since he lost
his shape-shifting abilities

103
00:06:33,744 --> 00:06:35,578
I haven't been able to get
a smile out of him.

104
00:06:35,615 --> 00:06:37,347
- Where is he?
- I'm telling you, Captain

105
00:06:37,387 --> 00:06:39,655
that's one depressed
ex-changeling.

106
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:42,221
He's upstairs
at his usual table.

107
00:06:42,266 --> 00:06:44,465
Just follow the black cloud.

108
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:51,390
Constable.

109
00:06:51,423 --> 00:06:52,892
Listen, Captain...

110
00:06:53,962 --> 00:06:55,431
do you hear it?

111
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,276
You mean the bubbles?

112
00:07:02,285 --> 00:07:04,780
Soothing, isn't it?

113
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:07,263
You know,
before I became a solid

114
00:07:07,298 --> 00:07:08,790
I never heard that.

115
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,566
I had no sense of taste

116
00:07:11,608 --> 00:07:14,946
so I never paid much attention
to food or drink.

117
00:07:14,984 --> 00:07:19,325
I had no idea
how seductive they could be.

118
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:28,350
Ah...

119
00:07:28,385 --> 00:07:31,689
Would you like me
to get you a glass?

120
00:07:31,728 --> 00:07:33,562
I'm on duty.

121
00:07:35,471 --> 00:07:36,872
I'm not.

122
00:07:36,908 --> 00:07:38,811
I thought you were
always on duty.

123
00:07:38,846 --> 00:07:40,145
Mm...

124
00:07:42,656 --> 00:07:45,026
You know, at first

125
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:49,037
I found the whole process
of ingestion disgusting.

126
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:51,201
But now that I've
gotten used to it

127
00:07:51,245 --> 00:07:55,051
I find eating and drinking
to be quite comforting.

128
00:07:55,155 --> 00:07:58,129
It's one of the few things
that you...

129
00:08:01,036 --> 00:08:03,098
that we...

130
00:08:03,142 --> 00:08:05,010
humanoids...

131
00:08:05,114 --> 00:08:07,348
have control over.

132
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:08,583
Not necessarily.

133
00:08:08,624 --> 00:08:10,788
There's always the temptation

134
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:13,461
to eat too much,
to drink too much.

135
00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:20,476
One has to find something
to do with one's time.

136
00:08:20,521 --> 00:08:23,153
For some reason,
my work isn't as...

137
00:08:23,194 --> 00:08:26,168
fulfilling as it used to be.

138
00:08:26,202 --> 00:08:29,574
I might be able to do something
about that.

139
00:08:29,611 --> 00:08:31,479
Starfleet has ordered us

140
00:08:31,516 --> 00:08:34,045
to try to expose
the Gowron changeling.

141
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:35,923
I want you to come with us.

142
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:39,201
Hmm.

143
00:08:39,235 --> 00:08:44,705
Maybe it would be better
for you to take Deputy Yndar.

144
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,382
There's nothing I can do
that he can't.

145
00:08:47,424 --> 00:08:49,588
I don't need Yndar.
I need you.

146
00:08:51,936 --> 00:08:58,146
What you need is someone who can
turn into Gowron's pet <i>targ.</i>

147
00:08:58,219 --> 00:09:00,383
I can't do that anymore.

148
00:09:00,424 --> 00:09:03,865
What I need
is my Chief of Security.

149
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,600
There will be a staff meeting
at 1600 hours.

150
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,577
I expect you to be there.

151
00:09:15,563 --> 00:09:17,397
According
to Starfleet Intelligence

152
00:09:17,435 --> 00:09:18,995
Chancellor Gowron has relocated

153
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:21,807
Klingon military headquarters
to Ty'Gokor.

154
00:09:21,847 --> 00:09:24,719
That will make our job
more difficult.

155
00:09:24,754 --> 00:09:27,158
Ty'Gokor is located
in an asteroid field

156
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,695
deep in Klingon space.

157
00:09:28,731 --> 00:09:32,001
It is probably the most heavily
fortified installation

158
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,168
in the Empire.

159
00:09:33,276 --> 00:09:35,612
There are at least 30 warships
stationed there

160
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:38,121
at any given time,
and the entire asteroid field

161
00:09:38,156 --> 00:09:41,028
is protected
by a tachyon detection grid.

162
00:09:41,063 --> 00:09:42,464
Which means there's no way

163
00:09:42,501 --> 00:09:44,529
we can get a cloaked ship
within transporter range.

164
00:09:44,572 --> 00:09:45,939
Even if we do find a way

165
00:09:45,976 --> 00:09:49,212
inside, getting close to Gowron
will not be easy.

166
00:09:49,284 --> 00:09:51,118
He is guarded around the clock

167
00:09:51,156 --> 00:09:53,994
by his personal security force,
the <i>Yan-Isleth.</i>

168
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,762
The Brotherhood of the Sword.

169
00:09:55,801 --> 00:09:57,795
Look, I don't want
to sound negative

170
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,834
but even if you do
get to Gowron

171
00:09:59,878 --> 00:10:01,974
how are you going to prove
to the Klingons

172
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:02,987
he's a changeling?

173
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,820
I doubt he's going
to stand still

174
00:10:04,858 --> 00:10:06,556
and let us take a blood sample.

175
00:10:06,596 --> 00:10:08,830
Klingons are obsessive
about blood screenings.

176
00:10:08,869 --> 00:10:09,929
If he's lasted this long

177
00:10:09,971 --> 00:10:11,635
the changeling
impersonating Gowron

178
00:10:11,676 --> 00:10:13,271
must've already found
a way around them.

179
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:15,581
There is another option.

180
00:10:15,619 --> 00:10:17,853
We could kill him.

181
00:10:17,892 --> 00:10:21,425
Dead changelings do revert
to their gelatinous state.

182
00:10:22,871 --> 00:10:27,076
Our orders are to expose Gowron,
not assassinate him.

183
00:10:27,116 --> 00:10:32,791
Which is why Starfleet
has given us these.

184
00:10:40,818 --> 00:10:43,017
Very impressive.

185
00:10:43,057 --> 00:10:44,652
What are they?

186
00:10:44,695 --> 00:10:47,567
They're modified
polaron emitters.

187
00:10:47,603 --> 00:10:50,736
Starfleet Science thinks
that exposure

188
00:10:50,778 --> 00:10:53,376
to polaron radiation
will have a destabilizing effect

189
00:10:53,418 --> 00:10:54,682
on changeling physiology.

190
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:58,390
In other words,
if we use these on Gowron

191
00:10:58,464 --> 00:10:59,990
and he is one of my people

192
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,940
he won't be able to retain
his humanoid shape.

193
00:11:02,975 --> 00:11:04,103
That's the theory.

194
00:11:04,145 --> 00:11:06,344
The problem is,
for it to work properly

195
00:11:06,418 --> 00:11:08,617
you have to activate
all four emitters at once.

196
00:11:08,657 --> 00:11:10,753
With this.

197
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:13,360
I hate prototypes.

198
00:11:13,436 --> 00:11:16,000
Plus, too much polaron radiation
can be fatal

199
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:18,915
which means we can only expose
a person once.

200
00:11:18,951 --> 00:11:20,717
Any more than that,
changeling or not

201
00:11:20,755 --> 00:11:22,885
and they could die
from radiation poisoning.

202
00:11:22,927 --> 00:11:26,333
The plan is to smuggle these
into Ty'Gokor.

203
00:11:26,369 --> 00:11:29,833
Once they're set up, they can
cover about 12,000 cubic meters.

204
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:31,782
So, let me get this straight.

205
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:34,757
All we have to do
is get past an enemy fleet

206
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:36,888
avoid a tachyon detection grid

207
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,958
beam into the middle
of Klingon headquarters

208
00:11:39,003 --> 00:11:40,563
and avoid the Brotherhood
of the Sword

209
00:11:40,606 --> 00:11:42,805
long enough to set these things
up and activate them

210
00:11:42,846 --> 00:11:44,179
in front of Gowron.

211
00:11:44,216 --> 00:11:46,016
If we succeed...

212
00:11:46,054 --> 00:11:48,754
there will be many songs sung
in our honor.

213
00:11:48,794 --> 00:11:50,458
Let's hope we're there
to hear them.

214
00:11:50,532 --> 00:11:52,058
Well, the first problem

215
00:11:52,103 --> 00:11:54,837
is how to get you safely
to Ty'Gokor.

216
00:11:54,877 --> 00:11:58,045
That's one I think I can solve.

217
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:11,351
Major, I must say I'm shocked.

218
00:12:11,386 --> 00:12:14,188
You use my daughter
to lure me here

219
00:12:14,227 --> 00:12:16,164
you're asking me to risk my ship

220
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:18,865
on some fool's errand
into the Klingon Empire

221
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:21,470
and you're pregnant.

222
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,642
I hope First Minister Shakaar

223
00:12:23,685 --> 00:12:26,487
appreciates
what a lucky man he is.

224
00:12:26,593 --> 00:12:29,065
Shakaar's not the father.

225
00:12:29,099 --> 00:12:30,500
But then who is?

226
00:12:30,603 --> 00:12:32,597
Chief O'Brien.

227
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:42,121
Promenade.

228
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,111
Well, at least
there's one good thing

229
00:12:47,145 --> 00:12:48,409
about your condition.

230
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,684
You won't be going
on this suicidal mission.

231
00:12:50,722 --> 00:12:52,382
It may not be
as hopeless as you think.

232
00:12:52,515 --> 00:12:54,075
How can Sisko be so deluded

233
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,684
to think that he
and three of his crewmen

234
00:12:56,726 --> 00:12:59,494
can infiltrate Klingon
military headquarters?

235
00:12:59,533 --> 00:13:01,629
They'll be caught
in a heartbeat.

236
00:13:01,673 --> 00:13:03,667
Maybe...

237
00:13:09,192 --> 00:13:11,186
maybe not.

238
00:13:16,544 --> 00:13:18,036
What's wrong, Dukat?

239
00:13:18,082 --> 00:13:21,683
Haven't you ever seen
a Klingon before?

240
00:13:41,175 --> 00:13:42,975
I see we're all here.

241
00:13:43,013 --> 00:13:45,542
The ship is ready
for departure, sir.

242
00:13:45,587 --> 00:13:47,786
At your convenience, Gul Dukat.

243
00:13:47,825 --> 00:13:49,819
Captain, I insist we make

244
00:13:49,864 --> 00:13:53,032
a holographic record
of the four of you.

245
00:13:53,073 --> 00:13:57,346
Consider it payment in full
for the use of my vessel.

246
00:13:57,384 --> 00:13:58,910
Maybe after the mission.

247
00:13:58,954 --> 00:14:00,686
After the mission,
you'll all be dead.

248
00:14:00,726 --> 00:14:05,762
Damar, let's not spoil
this special moment

249
00:14:05,805 --> 00:14:08,004
with predictions of doom.

250
00:14:08,045 --> 00:14:10,677
Even you have to appreciate

251
00:14:10,718 --> 00:14:14,216
the... audacity
of Captain Sisko's plan.

252
00:14:14,261 --> 00:14:16,232
Personally, I think
we'd be better off

253
00:14:16,266 --> 00:14:19,240
launching an orbital assault
on Gowron's Command Center.

254
00:14:19,274 --> 00:14:21,006
A full spread
of photon torpedoes

255
00:14:21,045 --> 00:14:23,574
would take care of him,
the Klingon High Command

256
00:14:23,619 --> 00:14:26,251
and everyone else within
a few hundred kilometers.

257
00:14:26,292 --> 00:14:29,232
Ha! You should ask Dukat
for some shore leave.

258
00:14:29,267 --> 00:14:31,762
I think you've been
in space too long.

259
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,112
Why? Because I'm willing
to spill a little Klingon blood

260
00:14:36,151 --> 00:14:37,552
to get the job done?

261
00:14:37,588 --> 00:14:40,288
Shelling Ty'Gokor
won't get the job done.

262
00:14:40,361 --> 00:14:42,560
You'd be lucky
to launch one torpedo

263
00:14:42,601 --> 00:14:44,093
before they shot you down.

264
00:14:44,138 --> 00:14:46,302
Besides, even a dozen
won't penetrate

265
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,680
the shielding around
the Command Center.

266
00:14:48,717 --> 00:14:50,688
Thank you for your input,
Mr. Damar

267
00:14:50,722 --> 00:14:52,784
but we'll stick
to the original plan.

268
00:14:52,827 --> 00:14:56,233
Have you made any progress
with our Klingon identity files?

269
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,432
Oh, don't worry, Captain.

270
00:14:57,473 --> 00:14:59,341
By the time we get to Ty'Gokor

271
00:14:59,378 --> 00:15:01,816
we'll have something
suitably impressive

272
00:15:01,851 --> 00:15:04,380
to plant in their central
computer system.

273
00:15:04,424 --> 00:15:06,760
Our names should be added
to the list of candidates

274
00:15:06,798 --> 00:15:08,165
for the Order of the <i>Bat'leth.</i>

275
00:15:08,201 --> 00:15:10,229
"The Order of the <i>Bat'leth"?</i>

276
00:15:10,273 --> 00:15:13,304
Don't you think
you might be overdoing it?

277
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:17,255
They'll be inducting
some new members in a few days

278
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:21,632
and Chancellor Gowron will be
presiding over the ceremony.

279
00:15:21,669 --> 00:15:25,041
That should make
for a very interesting evening.

280
00:15:31,996 --> 00:15:34,160
Here are the results
of the crew physicals.

281
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:36,138
Ah. Anything interesting?

282
00:15:36,173 --> 00:15:38,737
Lieutenant Vilix'pran
is budding again.

283
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,942
You're kidding.

284
00:15:39,984 --> 00:15:41,248
How many will this make?

285
00:15:41,287 --> 00:15:42,381
Oh, let's see now...

286
00:15:42,457 --> 00:15:44,121
he had two
from the last litter...

287
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,356
four before that...

288
00:15:45,397 --> 00:15:47,631
could be anywhere
from eight to 18.

289
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,003
He'll need
bigger quarters again.

290
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,512
He said the request will be
on your desk in the morning.

291
00:15:52,549 --> 00:15:53,950
Eighteen?!

292
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:56,824
I just hope I can survive one.

293
00:15:56,861 --> 00:15:57,830
You're doing great.

294
00:15:57,863 --> 00:15:59,800
Oh, I don't feel great.

295
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,238
You're... positively glowing.

296
00:16:02,274 --> 00:16:03,470
Oh, really?

297
00:16:03,511 --> 00:16:06,747
I think so, but then
I suppose my opinion

298
00:16:06,786 --> 00:16:08,381
doesn't really count.

299
00:16:08,457 --> 00:16:10,793
Oh, it counts,
but don't forget...

300
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,827
this is still your fault.

301
00:16:13,871 --> 00:16:15,135
My fault?!

302
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:17,409
You performed the transfer
from Keiko to me.

303
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,881
After you volunteered.

304
00:16:18,918 --> 00:16:20,410
After you put the idea
in my head.

305
00:16:20,455 --> 00:16:22,893
After you flew the runabout
into an asteroid field.

306
00:16:22,928 --> 00:16:23,954
After you insisted

307
00:16:23,998 --> 00:16:26,094
we check
on those anomalous bio-scans.

308
00:16:26,136 --> 00:16:27,537
That was Keiko!

309
00:16:27,574 --> 00:16:29,704
That's right, it was,
but I'd rather blame you!

310
00:16:29,746 --> 00:16:31,181
Whatever makes you happy.

311
00:16:31,216 --> 00:16:32,846
I never argue with my patients

312
00:16:32,887 --> 00:16:35,621
or my commanding officer.

313
00:16:41,142 --> 00:16:42,577
You think they'll make it?

314
00:16:42,613 --> 00:16:45,085
They'll make it.

315
00:16:45,119 --> 00:16:47,421
Question is:

316
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:50,956
Will you be able to give them
their old faces back?

317
00:16:59,757 --> 00:17:01,751
We shall start with you.

318
00:17:03,132 --> 00:17:04,796
I am waiting.

319
00:17:05,906 --> 00:17:07,706
I don't understand.

320
00:17:07,744 --> 00:17:09,476
I am not interested
in excuses.

321
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,143
Are you a Klingon warrior

322
00:17:11,186 --> 00:17:12,816
or an Alverian dung beetle?

323
00:17:12,858 --> 00:17:16,162
I really don't see the point...

324
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:17,498
Do not look away from me.

325
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,971
I called you a dung beetle.

326
00:17:19,007 --> 00:17:19,998
I heard you.

327
00:17:20,042 --> 00:17:21,409
And what is your response?

328
00:17:21,447 --> 00:17:23,509
You should have
your eyes examined.

329
00:17:27,663 --> 00:17:30,637
This is not going to work.

330
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:34,476
It is not enough
to look like a Klingon...

331
00:17:34,514 --> 00:17:37,146
one must act like one.

332
00:17:37,188 --> 00:17:40,060
Perhaps it is
better if I went...

333
00:17:41,331 --> 00:17:43,165
Are you questioning

334
00:17:43,203 --> 00:17:45,471
the validity of my plan?!

335
00:17:45,509 --> 00:17:46,944
Very convincing, Captain.

336
00:17:46,979 --> 00:17:49,508
But was it your intention
to challenge me

337
00:17:49,553 --> 00:17:51,079
to a battle to the death?

338
00:17:51,123 --> 00:17:52,217
No, not at all.

339
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,593
Then next time,
do not strike me

340
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,826
with the back of your hand.

341
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:55,857
Use your fist.

342
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,610
This is more complicated
than I thought.

343
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:01,948
You should think twice
before insulting

344
00:18:01,985 --> 00:18:03,511
a Klingon like that.

345
00:18:03,556 --> 00:18:04,525
What did I do?

346
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,550
Look at you...

347
00:18:05,594 --> 00:18:07,360
you stand so far away from me.

348
00:18:07,399 --> 00:18:08,561
You speak so softly.

349
00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:10,868
Are you afraid of me

350
00:18:10,908 --> 00:18:13,210
or just disgusted
by my presence?

351
00:18:13,247 --> 00:18:16,916
Klingon warriors speak
proudly to each other!

352
00:18:16,957 --> 00:18:18,587
They do not whisper

353
00:18:18,628 --> 00:18:20,531
or keep their distance!

354
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,092
Sorry!

355
00:18:23,976 --> 00:18:26,608
I'll do better next time.

356
00:18:27,819 --> 00:18:29,619
Keep practicing.

357
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:42,984
Constable?

358
00:18:43,025 --> 00:18:44,655
Captain...

359
00:18:44,696 --> 00:18:47,498
I have no business
being on this mission.

360
00:18:47,536 --> 00:18:49,838
I'm not
a very convincing Klingon.

361
00:18:49,876 --> 00:18:52,280
Then you better work
on becoming one

362
00:18:52,316 --> 00:18:53,478
because, like it or not

363
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:54,681
you are on this mission.

364
00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:56,692
I'd hate to be
the reason it fails.

365
00:18:56,727 --> 00:18:59,165
Let me worry about that.

366
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,643
Odo...

367
00:19:03,712 --> 00:19:06,652
I know this has been
a difficult time

368
00:19:06,686 --> 00:19:08,316
for you...

369
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:12,494
that you would have never
chosen to become a solid...

370
00:19:12,535 --> 00:19:15,839
but what's done is done.

371
00:19:15,876 --> 00:19:19,282
Brooding about it
isn't going to change anything

372
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:21,689
and shirking
your responsibilities

373
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:25,360
isn't going to make you feel
better about yourself.

374
00:19:28,577 --> 00:19:30,548
No...

375
00:19:30,582 --> 00:19:32,918
I don't suppose it will.

376
00:19:34,325 --> 00:19:37,299
Then I suggest
you get back in there

377
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,167
and do your job.

378
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:50,229
What's going on, Dukat?

379
00:19:50,266 --> 00:19:53,240
We're being hailed
by another bird-of-prey.

380
00:19:53,274 --> 00:19:55,245
What are you doing about it?

381
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:56,771
We're hailing them back.

382
00:19:56,883 --> 00:19:59,651
I wouldn't worry...
this happens all the time.

383
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:02,094
Sir, they're requesting
visual contact.

384
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:02,874
By all means.

385
00:20:03,008 --> 00:20:04,341
It's a shame you can't see

386
00:20:04,445 --> 00:20:07,043
the holo-image I'm projecting
over the com system.

387
00:20:07,085 --> 00:20:09,353
I make quite
an imposing Klingon.

388
00:20:09,425 --> 00:20:11,555
Sir, the holo-filter's
not working.

389
00:20:11,596 --> 00:20:13,191
What do you mean
it's not working?

390
00:20:13,234 --> 00:20:15,502
Let me take a look at it.

391
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:18,572
Sir, they're repeating
the request.

392
00:20:18,615 --> 00:20:21,281
The optronic relays are fused.

393
00:20:21,322 --> 00:20:23,259
Maybe Worf should speak to them.

394
00:20:23,294 --> 00:20:24,763
I might be able to convince...

395
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:26,632
I have a better idea.

396
00:20:34,022 --> 00:20:35,754
You should have
let me speak to them.

397
00:20:35,793 --> 00:20:37,423
Was that really necessary?!

398
00:20:37,531 --> 00:20:40,596
It was either that, or trust
to Mr. Worf's ability to lie

399
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:43,111
and frankly, I have more faith
in my weapons.

400
00:20:45,184 --> 00:20:47,018
Get us out of here, Damar.

401
00:20:47,056 --> 00:20:49,722
I want to put as much distance
between us

402
00:20:49,762 --> 00:20:51,926
and that wreckage as possible.

403
00:21:13,491 --> 00:21:15,725
I hope I remember
how to set this thing up.

404
00:21:15,763 --> 00:21:17,927
If that is a joke,
I am not amused.

405
00:21:17,969 --> 00:21:20,373
It's not easy being funny
wearing these teeth.

406
00:21:20,408 --> 00:21:24,647
Well, Captain, I've enjoyed
your company as always

407
00:21:24,686 --> 00:21:27,090
but it appears it is time
we said good-bye.

408
00:21:27,126 --> 00:21:29,758
I don't envy your assignment.

409
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:32,465
Orbiting this place
for the next day or so

410
00:21:32,507 --> 00:21:35,207
won't be the safest job
in the galaxy either.

411
00:21:35,247 --> 00:21:37,515
Which is why we'll be leaving

412
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,523
as soon as you beam down.

413
00:21:39,592 --> 00:21:40,959
Leaving?

414
00:21:40,995 --> 00:21:41,986
For how long?

415
00:21:42,032 --> 00:21:43,058
I really don't see

416
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:44,901
any pressing need to come back.

417
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,535
That's not what we agreed to.

418
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,205
I realize that.

419
00:21:48,248 --> 00:21:51,985
But how long do you think
we can stay here undetected

420
00:21:52,024 --> 00:21:53,722
without the holo-filter?

421
00:21:53,762 --> 00:21:56,200
Besides, if you succeed

422
00:21:56,236 --> 00:22:00,269
the war will be over
and you won't need us.

423
00:22:00,312 --> 00:22:02,044
And if you fail...

424
00:22:07,898 --> 00:22:10,530
Did you add our names
to the Commendation List?

425
00:22:10,573 --> 00:22:15,712
I haven't survived this long
by being sloppy, Mr. Worf.

426
00:22:15,753 --> 00:22:18,385
And now...

427
00:22:18,426 --> 00:22:22,027
Jodmos, son of Kobor...

428
00:22:22,069 --> 00:22:25,066
your medal awaits you.

429
00:22:33,699 --> 00:22:35,693
<i>Cho'Ghos!</i>

430
00:23:08,088 --> 00:23:09,079
Oh.

431
00:23:16,176 --> 00:23:17,304
You all right?

432
00:23:17,345 --> 00:23:18,871
I'm fine.

433
00:23:18,917 --> 00:23:21,481
I just wish they'd stop
ringing that bell.

434
00:23:26,101 --> 00:23:28,869
The Hall of Warriors.

435
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:32,646
You can smell the blood
of history in these stones.

436
00:23:32,686 --> 00:23:35,819
Come. We must celebrate.

437
00:23:35,861 --> 00:23:37,228
<i>T'QaH!</i>

438
00:23:38,434 --> 00:23:40,234
Now what?

439
00:23:40,272 --> 00:23:43,440
Now... we celebrate!

440
00:23:56,179 --> 00:23:57,478
How's the view?

441
00:23:57,516 --> 00:24:00,045
You know, you can tell a lot
about people's moods

442
00:24:00,089 --> 00:24:02,357
just by watching them walk
on the Promenade.

443
00:24:02,396 --> 00:24:07,205
When things are going good
people take their time...

444
00:24:07,242 --> 00:24:11,481
window shop,
talk to their friends.

445
00:24:12,589 --> 00:24:14,583
And then there's days
like today.

446
00:24:14,628 --> 00:24:16,531
Everybody's in a hurry.

447
00:24:16,566 --> 00:24:20,030
They can feel the Klingons
breathing down their necks.

448
00:24:20,075 --> 00:24:24,644
Well, I shall have to remember
to walk a little slower.

449
00:24:24,687 --> 00:24:26,681
"Show no fear."

450
00:24:26,726 --> 00:24:27,922
That's my motto.

451
00:24:27,962 --> 00:24:29,865
Ops to Dr. Bashir.

452
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,199
Go ahead, Major.

453
00:24:31,237 --> 00:24:32,297
Report to the Infirmary.

454
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,570
The <i>Armstrong</i> and the <i>Drake</i>

455
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:35,342
were ambushed
by a Klingon battle group

456
00:24:35,382 --> 00:24:36,783
and they took heavy casualties.

457
00:24:36,818 --> 00:24:38,413
They'll be docking
in a few minutes.

458
00:24:38,456 --> 00:24:39,482
I'm on my way.

459
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:44,304
Your father's going
to be all right, Jake.

460
00:24:45,675 --> 00:24:47,235
I suppose.

461
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,914
But sometimes I wish that
he wasn't so good at his job.

462
00:24:50,955 --> 00:24:53,051
That way, maybe
every once in a while

463
00:24:53,094 --> 00:24:55,828
they'd give someone else
the tough assignments.

464
00:24:55,868 --> 00:24:57,668
He goes where he's sent.

465
00:24:57,707 --> 00:24:59,975
It's all a part
of wearing the uniform

466
00:25:00,012 --> 00:25:02,780
and I doubt that's
ever going to change.

467
00:25:13,781 --> 00:25:16,914
I was the first
to board their starship.

468
00:25:16,956 --> 00:25:19,394
With one blow from my <i>bat'leth</i>

469
00:25:19,429 --> 00:25:21,924
I beheaded their helmsman

470
00:25:21,969 --> 00:25:24,305
a Tellarite.

471
00:25:24,342 --> 00:25:28,843
The pig didn't even have time
to raise his weapon.

472
00:25:28,887 --> 00:25:32,191
Well, then, I turned
my attention to the Captain

473
00:25:32,229 --> 00:25:34,633
a Benzenite named Laporin.

474
00:25:34,669 --> 00:25:39,045
Ah, he put up a valiant struggle

475
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,882
but in the end,
I ripped the breathing tubes

476
00:25:41,921 --> 00:25:43,390
from his head and...

477
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,742
Brag all you want

478
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:58,058
but don't get between me
and the bloodwine!

479
00:26:02,741 --> 00:26:04,176
<i>Qapla'!</i>

480
00:26:08,055 --> 00:26:10,151
You knew Captain Laporin?

481
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:12,530
We went to the Academy together.

482
00:26:12,567 --> 00:26:14,869
How long
before Gowron gets here?

483
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,707
Many hours.
He will not appear

484
00:26:16,745 --> 00:26:19,149
until tomorrow morning,
at the earliest.

485
00:26:19,184 --> 00:26:21,782
This is...
an endurance test

486
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,852
as much as it is
a celebration.

487
00:26:23,896 --> 00:26:24,922
It's part
of the Initiation Rite

488
00:26:25,033 --> 00:26:26,263
for the Order
of the <i>Bat'leth.</i>

489
00:26:26,303 --> 00:26:29,607
The idea is to eat, drink,
stay awake all night

490
00:26:29,644 --> 00:26:33,484
and still be clear-eyed when
Gowron arrives for the ceremony.

491
00:26:33,522 --> 00:26:35,652
So, when do we set up
the emitters?

492
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:36,754
Not until morning.

493
00:26:36,797 --> 00:26:38,700
I don't want to take the chance

494
00:26:38,735 --> 00:26:41,537
of anyone spotting them
once they're in place.

495
00:26:41,575 --> 00:26:43,911
In that case, we might
as well drink up.

496
00:26:45,085 --> 00:26:47,421
It's a pity it doesn't
have any bubbles.

497
00:27:12,591 --> 00:27:16,932
You know, I think I'm actually
beginning to like bloodwine.

498
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:19,464
It's really not too bad

499
00:27:19,509 --> 00:27:21,503
except for the taste.

500
00:27:21,614 --> 00:27:24,086
Just be thankful
the anti-intoxicant we took

501
00:27:24,121 --> 00:27:25,283
is still working.

502
00:27:25,324 --> 00:27:28,730
Or you would be so drunk
you would not be able to stand.

503
00:27:42,268 --> 00:27:43,567
Not bad.

504
00:27:43,639 --> 00:27:46,009
Captain of the Academy
wrestling team...

505
00:27:47,181 --> 00:27:49,311
22 years ago.

506
00:27:49,354 --> 00:27:50,823
Ow!

507
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,590
General Martok!

508
00:27:53,632 --> 00:27:54,828
Martok!

509
00:27:54,868 --> 00:27:56,600
Hail Martok!

510
00:27:57,708 --> 00:27:59,576
The General!

511
00:28:01,284 --> 00:28:02,344
Captain.

512
00:28:02,388 --> 00:28:04,552
I see him.

513
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:12,679
What if he recognizes us?

514
00:28:12,714 --> 00:28:15,118
Then we'll have come
a long way for nothing.

515
00:28:28,321 --> 00:28:29,312
<i>Qapla'.</i>

516
00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:31,819
<i>Qapla'.</i>

517
00:28:31,864 --> 00:28:33,299
- <i>Qapla'.</i>
- <i>Qapla'.</i>

518
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,000
<i>Qapla'.</i>

519
00:28:39,282 --> 00:28:42,780
If Martok is here
Gowron will not be far behind.

520
00:28:42,825 --> 00:28:44,455
Let's get it done.

521
00:29:17,583 --> 00:29:19,281
Hold on there.

522
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:23,597
Don't I know you?

523
00:29:23,631 --> 00:29:26,433
I would be honored
to think so.

524
00:29:26,472 --> 00:29:28,272
I know we have met.

525
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:31,409
I am Pahash
of the House of Konjah.

526
00:29:31,452 --> 00:29:34,050
The name is not familiar to me

527
00:29:34,092 --> 00:29:36,930
but there is
something about you...

528
00:29:36,966 --> 00:29:39,838
Perhaps we met
on the battlefield.

529
00:29:39,873 --> 00:29:43,075
My regiment fought at Mempa.

530
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:44,379
Mempa!

531
00:29:44,419 --> 00:29:48,863
Many noble deeds were done
on that dark day.

532
00:29:48,897 --> 00:29:51,267
And yours have become legend.

533
00:29:51,304 --> 00:29:52,773
Mempa...
yes, that must be it.

534
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,871
After the ceremony, would you
honor me with a drink?

535
00:29:55,915 --> 00:29:58,319
We will salute the fallen.

536
00:29:58,355 --> 00:30:01,193
There is something...

537
00:30:01,228 --> 00:30:04,863
very familiar about this face.

538
00:31:02,588 --> 00:31:05,390
Hey, where's Gowron?

539
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:15,348
What is this?

540
00:31:25,414 --> 00:31:27,978
Get away from me or you
won't live to see Gowron.

541
00:31:31,597 --> 00:31:32,793
I'll take that.

542
00:31:32,833 --> 00:31:34,929
This looks like
some sort of weapon.

543
00:31:34,972 --> 00:31:37,274
Kodrak, my brother!

544
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,747
Ah, you found it.

545
00:31:38,782 --> 00:31:40,377
Found what?

546
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,824
It is a tinghamut.

547
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,089
A what?

548
00:31:44,129 --> 00:31:46,863
A Vulcan toy for children.

549
00:31:46,903 --> 00:31:50,309
The spoils of war
from the raid on Archanis.

550
00:31:50,346 --> 00:31:53,752
If you want one
you will have to find your own.

551
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:55,017
Give this to your son.

552
00:31:55,091 --> 00:31:56,789
I'll make sure he gets it.

553
00:31:58,132 --> 00:32:00,866
Hail Gowron!

554
00:32:00,906 --> 00:32:04,278
- Gowron!
- Gowron!

555
00:32:20,891 --> 00:32:22,828
Long live Gowron!

556
00:32:22,863 --> 00:32:24,731
Long live the Empire!

557
00:32:28,445 --> 00:32:31,043
Klingon warriors, I salute you!

558
00:32:31,118 --> 00:32:34,890
At least those of you
still on your feet.

559
00:32:38,336 --> 00:32:41,242
This is a great day
for the Empire

560
00:32:41,277 --> 00:32:45,185
a day when we honor you
who have brought us glory

561
00:32:45,221 --> 00:32:50,566
whose deeds of valor
will live on in song and story!

562
00:32:52,841 --> 00:32:56,613
And so, now, here,
in this hallowed hall

563
00:32:56,651 --> 00:33:00,822
under the watchful gaze
of our greatest heroes

564
00:33:00,861 --> 00:33:02,764
you will receive
the highest honor

565
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,896
that can be bestowed
upon a Klingon...

566
00:33:04,939 --> 00:33:07,468
the Order of the <i>Bat'leth!</i>

567
00:33:09,517 --> 00:33:11,511
Gowron! Gowron!

568
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:12,650
Gowron!

569
00:33:19,176 --> 00:33:22,845
Come forward, H'Ta,
son of Kahmar.

570
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,147
Glory to you

571
00:33:34,249 --> 00:33:36,277
and your House.

572
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:44,533
This is my place!

573
00:33:44,575 --> 00:33:45,771
Step down.

574
00:33:45,811 --> 00:33:47,371
Find another.

575
00:33:47,416 --> 00:33:49,114
Come forward, T'Vis

576
00:33:49,153 --> 00:33:50,315
son of Barot.

577
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:56,001
That won't be necessary.

578
00:33:56,038 --> 00:33:58,100
Glory to you

579
00:33:58,144 --> 00:34:00,138
and your House.

580
00:34:00,182 --> 00:34:04,124
Come forward
Huss, daughter of Altrom.

581
00:34:10,413 --> 00:34:12,384
She brings honor to our House!

582
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:14,014
Glory to you

583
00:34:14,056 --> 00:34:17,189
and your House.

584
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:23,946
Come forward, Jodmos
son of Kobor.

585
00:34:51,788 --> 00:34:53,782
Glory to you

586
00:34:53,826 --> 00:34:56,664
and your House.

587
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:16,309
Captain Benjamin Sisko.

588
00:35:16,351 --> 00:35:18,846
I knew I recognized that face.

589
00:35:18,891 --> 00:35:20,155
Seal the room!

590
00:35:24,071 --> 00:35:27,672
It seems we have
some uninvited guests.

591
00:35:36,403 --> 00:35:38,875
Captain, you have no idea

592
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:42,009
how much I've looked forward
to killing you in battle.

593
00:35:42,051 --> 00:35:44,819
And now your foolishness
has cheated me

594
00:35:44,858 --> 00:35:45,884
of that pleasure.

595
00:35:45,928 --> 00:35:48,162
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

596
00:35:49,203 --> 00:35:50,194
Leave us.

597
00:35:51,643 --> 00:35:53,637
You heard me!

598
00:36:02,404 --> 00:36:04,204
Don't you understand?

599
00:36:04,242 --> 00:36:06,510
You've thrown your lives away
for nothing.

600
00:36:06,548 --> 00:36:09,818
Or did you really think you
could fool us into believing

601
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:12,522
that Chancellor Gowron
was a Dominion spy?

602
00:36:12,564 --> 00:36:14,934
Gowron is the one
who's fooling you.

603
00:36:14,969 --> 00:36:16,302
And as long as you follow him

604
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:18,870
the Empire will be nothing
but a pawn of the Founders.

605
00:36:18,914 --> 00:36:20,851
Where's your proof?!

606
00:36:20,885 --> 00:36:22,149
You want proof?

607
00:36:22,189 --> 00:36:24,251
Take our polaron emitters
and use them on Gowron.

608
00:36:24,294 --> 00:36:27,564
Gowron had
your equipment destroyed.

609
00:36:27,603 --> 00:36:29,301
Of course he did.

610
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,368
He had to make sure
he couldn't be tested.

611
00:36:31,413 --> 00:36:34,113
Captain, your mission
was a failure.

612
00:36:34,153 --> 00:36:36,387
For that, you deserve to die.

613
00:36:36,426 --> 00:36:38,556
Would you be happier
if we'd succeeded?

614
00:36:38,598 --> 00:36:41,800
I am a loyal officer
of the Empire.

615
00:36:44,981 --> 00:36:48,445
You think we're right,
don't you?

616
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:51,292
You believe that Gowron
is a changeling, too.

617
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:52,526
That would be treason!

618
00:36:52,567 --> 00:36:54,595
Since when is it treasonous

619
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,078
to act in the best interests
of the Empire?

620
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:01,649
How long have you suspected?

621
00:37:03,863 --> 00:37:05,230
Months.

622
00:37:05,267 --> 00:37:08,673
I've known Gowron a long time

623
00:37:08,709 --> 00:37:11,911
and it is no secret
that we have not always agreed

624
00:37:11,951 --> 00:37:13,922
on the way he runs the Empire.

625
00:37:13,957 --> 00:37:15,928
He is a politician.

626
00:37:15,962 --> 00:37:18,560
Too eager to compromise,
too eager to talk.

627
00:37:18,602 --> 00:37:21,576
Last year, he stopped the attack
on Deep Space 9

628
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:24,743
instead of going to war
with the Federation

629
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,310
and then he changed.

630
00:37:26,355 --> 00:37:29,386
Suddenly, he was the one
calling for war.

631
00:37:29,429 --> 00:37:31,765
I would've thought
that would make you happy.

632
00:37:31,802 --> 00:37:32,771
At first it did.

633
00:37:32,805 --> 00:37:34,297
But after the war began

634
00:37:34,342 --> 00:37:37,475
he started ignoring
the counsel of his generals

635
00:37:37,517 --> 00:37:40,183
throwing aside all wisdom
in his pursuit of victory.

636
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:43,563
Our losses continue to mount

637
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,537
and still he listens to no one.

638
00:37:45,572 --> 00:37:47,509
No one but the Founders.

639
00:37:47,543 --> 00:37:51,280
There is only one certain way

640
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,921
to expose Gowron
for what he really is.

641
00:37:54,963 --> 00:37:56,866
To prove beyond
a shadow of a doubt

642
00:37:56,901 --> 00:37:58,302
that he is a changeling.

643
00:37:59,642 --> 00:38:03,881
Gowron... must die.

644
00:38:03,952 --> 00:38:06,983
Once he's dead, he'll revert
to his natural form

645
00:38:07,027 --> 00:38:08,895
and all doubt
will be eliminated.

646
00:38:08,965 --> 00:38:11,871
You could challenge him
to honorable combat.

647
00:38:11,906 --> 00:38:13,774
There will be
no honorable combat

648
00:38:13,811 --> 00:38:15,041
no formal challenges.

649
00:38:15,081 --> 00:38:17,383
I will release you

650
00:38:17,421 --> 00:38:22,058
and help you reach
the Hall of Warriors

651
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:24,229
and then...

652
00:38:24,272 --> 00:38:27,269
you will kill him.

653
00:38:34,733 --> 00:38:37,832
The prisoners will come with me
for further interrogation.

654
00:38:37,874 --> 00:38:40,642
General, I have strict orders
from Gowron himself.

655
00:38:40,681 --> 00:38:43,085
The prisoners are not
to leave this cell.

656
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:44,420
I see.

657
00:38:44,458 --> 00:38:47,330
Well, we wouldn't want
to disobey the Chancellor.

658
00:38:52,044 --> 00:38:53,377
Follow me.

659
00:38:56,757 --> 00:38:59,697
What? Another toast?

660
00:38:59,731 --> 00:39:02,397
Then let us salute
Rurik the Damned

661
00:39:02,438 --> 00:39:06,312
conqueror of the Zora Fel,
liberator of Vrax.

662
00:39:17,176 --> 00:39:18,736
For the Empire.

663
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,113
Let's go.

664
00:39:22,055 --> 00:39:23,547
Not you.

665
00:39:23,593 --> 00:39:24,926
There's no telling

666
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:27,561
where your loyalties lie.

667
00:39:35,323 --> 00:39:36,987
What is this?

668
00:39:37,027 --> 00:39:38,622
It is your death!

669
00:39:47,187 --> 00:39:48,247
No!

670
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,524
Lower your weapons.

671
00:39:50,563 --> 00:39:52,591
If this traitor wants a fight

672
00:39:52,635 --> 00:39:54,937
I will give him one.

673
00:39:54,974 --> 00:39:56,774
You want to kill me, Worf?

674
00:39:56,812 --> 00:39:58,544
You're welcome to try.

675
00:40:09,578 --> 00:40:10,877
What are they doing?

676
00:40:10,915 --> 00:40:12,977
Why doesn't Sisko
just shoot him?

677
00:40:13,021 --> 00:40:14,651
I have a better question.

678
00:40:14,692 --> 00:40:17,494
Why isn't Gowron letting
his bodyguards kill Worf?

679
00:40:17,533 --> 00:40:18,832
I'll tell you why.

680
00:40:18,869 --> 00:40:20,168
Klingon honor.

681
00:40:20,206 --> 00:40:22,508
A concept you should
be very familiar with.

682
00:40:22,546 --> 00:40:25,178
My people, on the other hand
don't care about honor.

683
00:40:25,252 --> 00:40:26,551
How did you put it?

684
00:40:26,589 --> 00:40:28,560
"There will be
no honorable combat

685
00:40:28,595 --> 00:40:30,190
no formal challenges."

686
00:40:30,265 --> 00:40:32,031
Hardly the words of a Klingon.

687
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,700
Tell me, General

688
00:40:33,742 --> 00:40:36,544
did Gowron destroy
the polaron emitters

689
00:40:36,582 --> 00:40:38,212
or did you?

690
00:41:04,874 --> 00:41:06,708
Worf, stop!

691
00:41:15,134 --> 00:41:17,105
Martok's the changeling!

692
00:41:43,274 --> 00:41:47,981
Well, looks like we found
our changeling after all.

693
00:41:56,943 --> 00:42:00,281
So the Founders mislead Odo
into thinking I was a spy

694
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:02,221
hoping that you'd eliminate me

695
00:42:02,256 --> 00:42:05,789
and pave the way for that thing
imitating Martok

696
00:42:05,833 --> 00:42:07,166
to take over the Empire.

697
00:42:07,203 --> 00:42:08,638
That way, the war

698
00:42:08,673 --> 00:42:10,439
between the Federation
and the Klingons

699
00:42:10,478 --> 00:42:12,677
would continue
until both sides were destroyed.

700
00:42:12,717 --> 00:42:15,953
Leaving the Alpha Quadrant wide
open for a Dominion invasion.

701
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:18,191
That seems to have been
their plan.

702
00:42:18,232 --> 00:42:19,964
And we played right into it.

703
00:42:20,003 --> 00:42:23,307
But they sorely
underestimated Odo here.

704
00:42:23,345 --> 00:42:24,975
Thank you.

705
00:42:25,016 --> 00:42:27,352
If we really want to strike
a blow against the Founders

706
00:42:27,421 --> 00:42:29,655
we have to find a way
to end this war.

707
00:42:29,694 --> 00:42:30,754
That may not be possible.

708
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,062
Why not?

709
00:42:32,101 --> 00:42:33,833
You told us
that the Martok changeling

710
00:42:33,872 --> 00:42:36,208
was the one who pushed for
the attack on the Federation.

711
00:42:36,244 --> 00:42:38,773
True, but if your Klingon blood
wasn't so thin

712
00:42:38,819 --> 00:42:40,517
you'd know
that once battle has begun

713
00:42:40,556 --> 00:42:41,820
there can be no turning back.

714
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:43,557
You want the war to end?

715
00:42:43,597 --> 00:42:46,365
Then the Federation
must allow us to annex Archanis

716
00:42:46,405 --> 00:42:48,273
and the other worlds
we've seized.

717
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:51,284
I wouldn't count on that.

718
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:55,989
But if the fighting stops
and the negotiations begin...

719
00:42:56,029 --> 00:42:58,125
Ah, yes. Talk.

720
00:42:59,606 --> 00:43:00,632
That's right... talk.

721
00:43:00,674 --> 00:43:03,306
The last thing
the Dominion wants.

722
00:43:10,166 --> 00:43:12,638
I will call a meeting
of the High Council.

723
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:15,373
Advise a temporary cease-fire.

724
00:43:15,413 --> 00:43:18,387
Where Gowron leads,
the Council will follow.

725
00:43:18,421 --> 00:43:19,720
Perhaps.

726
00:43:19,758 --> 00:43:22,390
I'll see to it
that you're safely delivered

727
00:43:22,431 --> 00:43:24,630
back to that space station
of yours.

728
00:43:24,671 --> 00:43:26,403
I'd appreciate that.

729
00:43:29,316 --> 00:43:32,347
You have done a great
service to the Empire.

730
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:34,054
For that, I thank you.

731
00:43:37,805 --> 00:43:39,435
As for you...

732
00:43:39,475 --> 00:43:42,472
you should have killed me
when you had the chance.

733
00:43:42,583 --> 00:43:46,286
I promise
you won't get another.

734
00:43:58,392 --> 00:44:00,626
Now, that's better, isn't it?

735
00:44:01,767 --> 00:44:02,895
I don't know.

736
00:44:02,936 --> 00:44:04,930
I could do
without the ridges, but...

737
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:06,535
I kind of miss the fangs.

738
00:44:07,916 --> 00:44:09,819
Well, that leaves you, Odo.

739
00:44:09,854 --> 00:44:11,118
It's about time.

740
00:44:11,158 --> 00:44:12,958
I, for one, won't miss
the fangs at all.

741
00:44:12,996 --> 00:44:14,295
Well, you know

742
00:44:14,332 --> 00:44:16,496
Constable, I can give you
any face you like...

743
00:44:16,572 --> 00:44:18,509
Bajoran, human, Trill.

744
00:44:18,577 --> 00:44:21,483
My old face will do
very nicely, thank you.

745
00:44:21,518 --> 00:44:23,182
You heard the man.

746
00:44:23,222 --> 00:44:24,691
Whatever you say.
