00:00:01,585 --> 00:00:05,840
SISKO:
<i>Station Log, Stardate 47573.1.</i>

2
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:08,759
<i>To respond to questions</i>
<i>about setting up colonies</i>
<i>near the wormhole,</i>

3
00:00:08,801 --> 00:00:11,052
<i>Chief O'Brien and I</i>
<i>have set out</i>

4
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:13,514
<i>to survey nearby star systems.</i>

5
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:15,933
If it's an imposition...

6
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:17,225
No, sir, it's fine.

7
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:19,353
You're sure?

8
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:20,562
I'm sure, Commander.

9
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:22,815
Jake's a good fellow.

10
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:25,066
I'll enjoy
working with him.

11
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,944
I don't want you to make it
easy for him, Chief.

12
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:28,111
He has to know

13
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,071
what it takes
to make it in Starfleet.

14
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,032
I'll have him
up to his elbows

15
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:33,701
in thorium grease, sir.

16
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:35,410
It's not going
to be easy for him.

17
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,621
He placed in the lower
third of his age group

18
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:38,789
in mechanical aptitude.

19
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:41,124
Oh, good for him.
So did I.

20
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:44,503
You? Come on.
No, it's true.

21
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:47,046
It wasn't until I got
to the Cardassian front

22
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:49,257
I found out I had talents
I never knew I had.

23
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,384
At the front?

24
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:51,969
It was a matter
of figuring out

25
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:54,805
how to get a field transporter
operational in ten minutes

26
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:57,850
or wind up being
a Cardassian prisoner of war.

27
00:00:57,892 --> 00:01:01,812
Now, I didn't know a transporter
from a turbolift in those days,

28
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:05,440
but somehow,
in nine minutes, 53 seconds,

29
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,317
I got that thing to work.

30
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:10,529
I got 13 men safely
off the surface of Setlik III.

31
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:11,906
Next thing I know

32
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:13,615
I'm the tactical officer
on the<i> Rutledge.</i>

33
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:15,116
That's how I got
the gold suit.

34
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,745
Well, Jake is ready
for a new suit, too.

35
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:20,789
The boy seems to grow
a centimeter each week.

36
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,584
You know, he struck me out
with a curve ball the other day.

37
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,252
First time.

38
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:28,589
They grow up in a hurry,
don't they, sir?

39
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,173
That they do.

40
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:34,135
I think I've got one.

41
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,263
Computer, set
a new heading.

42
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:38,265
41 mark 301.

43
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,726
COMPUTER:
Confirmed.

44
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:42,686
It's an M-Class,
all right.

45
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:45,856
160 million kilometers
from Orellius Minor.

46
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:47,649
Should be a perfect place

47
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,359
to set up
a colony.
Mm-hmm,

48
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:51,695
But it looks like
someone's beaten us to it.

49
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:53,447
You're reading
life-forms?

50
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:54,907
Human life-forms.

51
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:57,534
I don't see anything
on the books

52
00:01:57,576 --> 00:02:00,454
about a colony
in the Orellius system.

53
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,330
Trying all hailing frequencies.

54
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,666
Moving into synchronous orbit.

55
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,544
No response.

56
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:10,505
I'm picking up some kind of
low-level duonetic field down
there.

57
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,716
It may be blocking
communications.

58
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:15,719
Let's introduce ourselves
to our neighbors.

59
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,022
(<i> tricorders buzzing</i> )

60
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:28,523
Yours, too?

61
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,609
Even the self-diagnostics
aren't working.

62
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,527
Just plain dead.

63
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,322
Sisko to<i> Rio Grande.</i>

64
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,240
Computer, respond.

65
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,493
(<i> buzzing</i> )

66
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,495
I'd say there's
no EM activity

67
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,788
at all around here.

68
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,998
Any idea why?

69
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,874
I'm not sure.

70
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,501
But it might have
something to do

71
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,878
with that duonetic field
our sensors picked up.

72
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,296
Well, I hope you find

73
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,881
a few more of those talents
you never knew you had

74
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:54,633
because, if you don't,
we're going to have

75
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:55,634
a hard time
getting off this...

76
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,136
MAN:
Don't move!

77
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:01,765
And put your hands up!

78
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,806
Turn around...

79
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,057
slowly.

80
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:17,859
They're from Starfleet.

81
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,194
That's right.

82
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:20,779
Mind if we put
our hands down?

83
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,491
Well, the uniforms
have changed...

84
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:27,786
or have I just forgotten
what they look like?

85
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,288
My name is Joseph.

86
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,539
Vinod's the one playing
with the sharp object.

87
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,874
I'm Benjamin Sisko

88
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,168
and this is
Miles O'Brien.

89
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,585
How did you
get here?

90
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,420
We were going to ask you
the same thing.

91
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,506
We were surveying
for habitable planets

92
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,382
when our sensors picked
up your life signs.

93
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,677
There was no record
of a human colony here.

94
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,887
Well, our group was on its way
to settle on Gemulon V

95
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,264
over ten years ago

96
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:49,266
when our ship developed
life-support problems

97
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:50,976
and we had to land here
for repairs.

98
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,270
Once we got here,
all our systems failed.

99
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:54,313
Nothing worked
anymore.

100
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:55,772
So we've seen.

101
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,398
JOSEPH:
We've been stuck here
ever since.

102
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,609
And I guess you
are, too, now.

103
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,028
We have a ship in orbit.

104
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,612
It won't take our
people long to find us.

105
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,323
We'll be able
to get you all out of here.

106
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:06,616
Well, after ten years,
this is our home.

107
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:09,286
But you just
said it yourself--

108
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:10,620
nothing works.

109
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:12,289
Well,<i> we</i> still do.

110
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:14,415
Well, come,
we'll show you.

111
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,543
Vinod, run ahead
and tell your mother, uh...

112
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,753
we have guests.

113
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:21,215
Come.

114
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:38,273
Erewon-class
personnel transport.

115
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,108
Commissioned
the<i> Santa Maria.</i>

116
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,236
Now we just call
it "the cabin."

117
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:48,533
After all this
time-- visitors!

118
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,995
JOSEPH:
Alixus, meet
Ben and Miles.

119
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:55,165
ALIXUS:
Welcome to
our community.

120
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:56,457
Miles.

121
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,751
Are there
others?

122
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,836
Just an empty
runabout in orbit.

123
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:02,256
Hopefully, it will
attract some attention.

124
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,591
A runabout-- is that some kind
of new Starfleet vessel?

125
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:07,468
Yeah, they commissioned the
first ones two years ago.

126
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,470
They're a short-range
interstellar craft

127
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,349
about a quarter the size
of your "cabin" there.

128
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:14,434
I was the engineer
aboard the<i> Santa Maria.</i>

129
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:15,852
You and Miles
will have a lot

130
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,520
to talk about, Joseph.

131
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,606
I'm sure all of us have
questions for our guests.

132
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,316
Who won the soccer matches
this year?

133
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,068
Is Golanga
still playing?

134
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,861
No, he hurt his knee
four years ago.

135
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:26,529
They replaced it
with a bio-implant

136
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,282
but he wasn't
the same after that.

137
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:30,200
Who was it that won
last year, anyway?

138
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:31,285
I can never remember.

139
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,494
What are women's
fashions like

140
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,955
back home now?

141
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,124
Oh, well...

142
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,126
Chief, you're
the married one.

143
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,585
Oh, Keiko, my wife

144
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:44,131
she's been replicating
longer dresses lately.

145
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,506
Oh, no, that means

146
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,884
I'll have to alter
everything I own.

147
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,886
(<i> laughter</i> )

148
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:52,555
Well, that may just be
the Bajoran styles

149
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,266
she sees on
<i>Deep Space 9.</i>

150
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:55,225
On<i> Deep Space 9?</i>

151
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:57,227
I'm sure
Ben and Miles

152
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,229
will be happy to tell us
everything we want to know.

153
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:01,273
There will be plenty
of time for that later.

154
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:02,857
Actually, the first
thing I'd like to do

155
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,943
is try and get
some response from
the EM systems.

156
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:08,571
We gave up any hope
of that years ago.

157
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,699
Yes, we noticed a low-level
duonetic field in the area

158
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:12,909
before
we transported down.

159
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,369
Yes, the same thing

160
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,621
appeared on our sensors
when we were landing.

161
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,124
Our engines failed almost
the instant we hit the surface.

162
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,835
Without a
functional tricorder

163
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,296
it was virtually impossible
to track down the source.

164
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,423
We do know that the
marshes all around us

165
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:28,591
are filled with
astatine deposits.

166
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,886
That's the only
explanation we have.

167
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:35,598
But we've done pretty well
without our tricorders

168
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,768
EM converters and com links,
haven't we?

169
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,397
After all, the human body
is a powerful tool.

170
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:46,776
We can plow the crops,
harvest the fields

171
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,403
construct the walls

172
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:51,572
that we need for protection
against the wilderness.

173
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:54,242
Weave the clothes that
we need to stay warm.

174
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,411
In a way,
we've rediscovered

175
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:59,622
what man is capable of
without technology.

176
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,666
It hasn't been easy.

177
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,378
We've had some bitter winters

178
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:08,798
and... we've lost
some dear friends.

179
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,927
But we're very proud
of what we've accomplished here.

180
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,804
You have every
right to be.

181
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:16,348
Are we all going to leave

182
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,308
when the others come
to rescue them?

183
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,687
That's something each of us

184
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,065
is going to have
to think about, isn't it?

185
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,532
Are you going
to leave, Alixus?

186
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,244
Speaking for myself, no.

187
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,120
No, I'll never leave.

188
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,663
And I'll
never want

189
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,875
what we have in our
community to change.

190
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,752
It means too much to me.

191
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,628
But while you are here,

192
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:52,133
you are welcome to everything
our community has to offer.

193
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:55,095
The only thing we ask
is that you contribute.

194
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,721
We all work for our supper.

195
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,056
You'd be surprised

196
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,267
how much sweeter it tastes
when you do.

197
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,643
We'll be happy
to do our part.

198
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:06,106
Joseph, would you find them
some bunks, please?

199
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,907
Two more strong,
healthy men, Vinod.

200
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:20,287
That could mean
an awful lot to
this community.

201
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,009
Do you know
an Admiral Mitsuya?

202
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,346
Best poker player in
the fleet, next to me.

203
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,014
Well, he's diverting
the<i> Crockett</i>

204
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,767
to stop at DS9
day after tomorrow

205
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,228
to talk about Cardassian
foreign policy?

206
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,231
That's just an excuse
to get Benjamin in a game.

207
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:50,484
Mitsuya cleaned him out
last year.

208
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:51,692
We better hail the<i> Rio Grande</i>

209
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,488
and get them
headed back this way.

210
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:57,449
I've worked two lifetimes
on Benjamin's poker.

211
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,409
He just can't learn
how to bluff.

212
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:00,952
That's odd.

213
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,330
I know, you'd think
a man like Benjamin...

214
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,832
No, the<i> Rio Grande...</i>

215
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:09,628
it's not responding
to our hails.

216
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,753
O'BRIEN:
Commander?

217
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,088
Oh, come in, Chief.

218
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,715
I was just reading
one of the books

219
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,009
our host has written.

220
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,512
Alixus is quite
a prolific author.

221
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:21,889
Yeah, a bunch of these
were left in my room, too.

222
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,559
I haven't had a chance
to look at them.

223
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,603
What does she
write about?

224
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:30,190
She seems to have something
to say on just about everything.

225
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,525
Yeah?

226
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:34,319
Economic analysis,
political commentaries,

227
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:35,487
literary critiques.

228
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:36,737
She says she's
spent her life

229
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,739
examining the
human condition.

230
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:39,866
And what's
her prognosis?

231
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,117
Not very good.

232
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,452
She says we
have become

233
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:46,122
fat and lazy and dull.

234
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:50,418
My wife told me something along
those lines just last week.

235
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:54,047
"The common conceit that
the human species has evolved

236
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,799
"over the last several
centuries is ludicrous.

237
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,426
"What gains we have made

238
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:01,846
"have come at the cost
of our own core identities.

239
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:05,350
Man has lost touch
with his true power."

240
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:10,063
Sounds like it took
a crash landing

241
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,357
for her to find
her paradise.

242
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,405
SISKO:
Have you found anything
in their ship

243
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,365
that can help us
restore contact
with the runabout?

244
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,325
There's nothing<i> to</i> find.

245
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,412
Wave guides,
conduits, baffle plates--

246
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,954
you name it, it's gone.

247
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,289
The ship looks like

248
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,500
it's been through
a Ferengi junkyard.

249
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:31,834
What happened
to it all?

250
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,127
We threw it away.

251
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,296
Well, since,
uh, none of it worked

252
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:40,385
to us, it was merely useless
junk taking up space.

253
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,053
Alixus felt its presence

254
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,598
was a constant reminder
of who you used to be.

255
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,058
Well, we all had to abandon
our dependence upon technology.

256
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,851
Removing every trace of it--

257
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,937
well, that made
the transition easier.

258
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:53,064
As an engineer,
you must have had

259
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,773
some problems
with that.

260
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,361
Well, I<i> was</i>
the last convert.

261
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:01,698
But, as time passed,
I realized Alixus was right.

262
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,575
She was helping us discover

263
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,702
a new philosophy of life
together

264
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:09,956
because we needed one
to survive.

265
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,667
And I'll tell you,

266
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,377
every one of us
is better for it.

267
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,254
We are more committed
to each other.

268
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,506
We are truly a part
of each other's lives.

269
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:21,175
We've renewed a sense
of community

270
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:24,137
that man left behind
centuries ago.

271
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:27,474
Joseph, Meg's fever
is getting worse.

272
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,611
The new herb doesn't seem
to be helping at all.

273
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:41,529
May I see?
Please.

274
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:44,198
We have an insect here
that transmits a disease

275
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,242
we haven't found
a cure for.

276
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,536
We've lost three
to it already.

277
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,288
Have you found
anything in the forest

278
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,415
like the sleeper fungi?

279
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,959
We've searched everywhere
for the right fungus or root

280
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,544
that would draw out
the infection.

281
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:57,920
SISKO:
If it keeps spreading,

282
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,839
she'll die before the
rescue team finds us.

283
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,342
O'BRIEN:
The medical kit
in the runabout

284
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,135
could probably
take care of this in a second.

285
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,512
We have got to find a way

286
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,347
to restore the com link
to the transporter.

287
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,557
That would only be
a waste of time.

288
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:12,519
This duonetic field
inhibits energy flow,

289
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,896
but a duonetic field
is a form of energy, too.

290
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,733
Maybe we could modify
our communicators

291
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,527
to run on the field itself.

292
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,861
Do you really think you could?

293
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,988
No!

294
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,949
If you want to put
your efforts to good use,

295
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,703
search the forest
for something else we might use.

296
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:30,995
This is primitive medicine.

297
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,622
You can't expect to save her...

298
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:36,083
Ben! May I see you
outside, please?

299
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:40,087
Talk like that
isn't constructive.

300
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,756
I'm talking about
saving the life

301
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,341
of one of your
followers.

302
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,092
You don't understand
this yet.

303
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,135
No one follows me.

304
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,970
They follow
their own hearts.

305
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,515
My heart tells me to try
to get back to my ship.

306
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:51,725
I'm sure it does,

307
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,226
but if we'd had
that attitude

308
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,394
for the last ten years

309
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,729
we wouldn't
have been doing

310
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,856
what was necessary
to survive here.

311
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:01,568
To find the plants, herbs, molds
that cure disease.

312
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:05,112
We've conquered 17 illnesses

313
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,741
with the most powerful resource
man has--

314
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,033
his ingenuity.

315
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,660
An interesting philosophy.

316
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:13,162
And while we're debating
it, a woman is dying.

317
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:15,331
We're doing everything
we can for her.

318
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:16,708
No, we're not.

319
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,376
I won't have you disrupting

320
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:21,128
everything this community
has worked for, Ben.

321
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,715
I don't intend to stay here
any longer than necessary.

322
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,341
And that's another thing.

323
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:28,344
Let's not bring up the Starfleet
rescue party again.

324
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:30,555
Until they come--
if they come--

325
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,099
you'll have to do things
our way.

326
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:39,522
I'd strongly advise
you get rid of that uniform.

327
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:43,526
By mid-afternoon,
it gets hot in the fields.

328
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,670
The<i> Rio Grande's</i> been spotted.

329
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,046
Where?

330
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,215
Details are coming in
from Starfleet.

331
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:07,884
The Romulan vessel<i> Gasko</i>

332
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:10,177
reported seeing
an abandoned runabout.

333
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:14,265
Markings NCC-72452.

334
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,643
That's our ship,
all right.

335
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,813
Traveling at warp 2
through sector 401.

336
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,398
At warp, with
no one on board?

337
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,275
Command wants to know
if we can send someone

338
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,318
to investigate.

339
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,986
Signal them affirmative.

340
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,364
I already have.

341
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,199
Runabout Pad C.

342
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:37,413
You've got a real
talent for this, Ben.

343
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:39,582
Well, my father
was a chef.

344
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:42,418
He grew all
his own vegetables.

345
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:47,340
My brothers and I were sent out
to the gardens every day.

346
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,466
Most of the others--

347
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,050
they'd only eaten
replicated food

348
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,385
before they got here.

349
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,053
The flavor of the foods
we prepare

350
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,472
was quite a surprise
to them.

351
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,474
But not you?

352
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:59,727
My mother would never
let me eat replicated food.

353
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,230
(<i> chuckling</i> )

354
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,732
What?

355
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:07,902
I can't help thinking
what my wife would say

356
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,779
if she saw me doing this.

357
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,364
Why?

358
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,283
Well, around my house I'm
known as "the black thumb."

359
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:16,661
I'm just one
of those people, you know.

360
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,913
The only way I could get
anything to grow

361
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,164
was to marry a botanist.

362
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,666
Oh, a botanist, really?

363
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:22,834
Yeah.

364
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:24,293
You should have seen
the arboretum

365
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:25,503
she grew on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

366
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,297
That's where I asked her
to marry me.

367
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,924
Oh, she'd love it here.

368
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:32,635
Maybe you'll
bring her someday.

369
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,053
Trouble is,
she wouldn't want to leave.

370
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,763
That's okay, too.

371
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,600
(<i> metal clanking</i> )

372
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,564
Come on.

373
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,025
Reach in.

374
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,026
Get my hand.

375
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:48,985
Here we go.

376
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:50,028
Good.

377
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,029
Easy now.

378
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,154
(<i> panting</i> )

379
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:02,498
Get him into the shade.

380
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:16,012
All right, sit
him down there.

381
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:17,346
Easy, easy.

382
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,348
All right, here.
All right, here.

383
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,767
Here, Stephan,
if you chew these,

384
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:24,395
they will help you
regain your strength.

385
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,313
What did he do
to deserve this?

386
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,107
He stole
a candle.

387
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,650
One candle?

388
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:30,985
How long was
he in there?

389
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,820
Since yesterday.

390
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,906
In that
hell box?

391
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:37,491
Is this part of your philosophy
of life, too?

392
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,035
You're a Starfleet
Commander.

393
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:40,912
I'm sure
you've had to discipline

394
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:42,162
members of your crew.

395
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,372
Discipline
is one thing.

396
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:44,707
Torture is another.

397
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:47,334
The first thing
this community accepted

398
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,670
was the need to establish
rules of conduct.

399
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,547
All of us,
including Stephan,

400
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,925
approved this form of
punishment as necessary

401
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,969
and fair.

402
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,012
How are you, Stephan?

403
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:01,265
(<i> coughing</i> )

404
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,643
I'll be all right.

405
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:09,690
I'm sorry, Alixus,
that I let down the community.

406
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:12,276
The matter is closed.

407
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,653
Go inside.

408
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,613
Get some rest now.

409
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,365
Thank you, Alixus.

410
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,784
Come on, easy.

411
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,411
Easy.

412
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,789
Stephan will never
steal another candle

413
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,749
and neither will
anyone else

414
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,042
who saw him here today.

415
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,336
In time, you'll
understand

416
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,212
that this is a simple

417
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,631
and effective way

418
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,300
to maintain law and order
in our community.

419
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,477
I get the distinct impression

420
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,896
she expects us
to be here for a while.

421
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:51,190
If there is a way
to adapt the energy

422
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,650
in the duonetic field

423
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,694
to get us back to the runabout

424
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,445
I want you to find it, Chief.

425
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,156
Yes, sir.

426
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,964
Is there anything
you need?

427
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:20,011
No, I don't think so.

428
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:25,224
I'm sorry, Alixus
doesn't believe in doors.

429
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:28,227
We all take it
for granted now.

430
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,855
You'll get used to it.

431
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:33,107
Hopefully, I won't
be here long enough

432
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:34,525
to get used to it.

433
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,527
You don't like it here,
do you?

434
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,113
It's not what
I'm used to.

435
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:40,740
Alixus has reminded us all

436
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,201
that it wasn't easy
for us at first either.

437
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,327
She's told us
to be patient with you.

438
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,747
Has she?

439
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,708
Your muscles must be sore
from all the work today.

440
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,794
This is an oil extract
from the Xupta tree.

441
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:56,214
It's wonderfully
soothing.

442
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,716
Thanks, I'll try some.

443
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,260
Would you like me
to massage you with it?

444
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,555
I don't think so.

445
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:05,806
Thanks anyway.

446
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,644
It'll make you feel
a lot better.

447
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,773
Here, let me show you.

448
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,195
Did she send you here?

449
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:24,992
Did she send you here
to make love to me?

450
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,836
Ben, come in.

451
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,588
I was just
writing

452
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,092
about you and Miles
in my journal.

453
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:43,261
I understand
you're quite a chef.

454
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,974
That's the first
core behavior

455
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,392
I've seen from you
since you arrived.

456
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,477
Core behavior.

457
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,229
Does that chapter come

458
00:21:53,271 --> 00:21:55,689
before or after
sexual procurement?

459
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,151
I assume you're talking
about Cassandra?

460
00:21:58,192 --> 00:21:59,986
Did you send her
to my room?

461
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,487
Yes.

462
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,281
I think you're contemptible.

463
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,032
Interesting.

464
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:07,493
Contemptible.

465
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,870
Try and see it
through our eyes

466
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:11,998
just for a moment, Ben.

467
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:16,210
Cassandra came to me;
she was worried.

468
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:19,421
She sensed that
you weren't happy.

469
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,798
She was right about that.

470
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,842
She was concerned
that all you see here

471
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,218
is work and hardship,

472
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,345
and she wanted you to share
in our joy as well.

473
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:30,516
So you sent her to me to win
my devotion to your cause.

474
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:33,393
I suggested she might
make it easier for you

475
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,812
to become a member
of our community.

476
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,897
The choice was hers.

477
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:39,608
Cassandra really
likes you, Ben.

478
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:47,241
It's fortunate that all these
books of yours aren't on padds

479
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:50,744
like the other materials
the colonists brought.

480
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,663
I used to print them
myself.

481
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,248
I'm not surprised.

482
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,416
Vinod tells me that you never
ate replicated food

483
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,877
before you came here.

484
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:02,673
I'm not sure
I see the connection.

485
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:05,634
It's just that you
never had much use

486
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:07,720
for technology, did you?

487
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,597
It's interesting how you
happened to crash on a planet

488
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,059
that fit your philosophy
of life so well.

489
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,434
I agree.

490
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,854
In fact, I've started
writing a book

491
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,231
about our experiences.

492
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,606
I've been wondering

493
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,026
if, in the ancient
religions of man

494
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:23,986
there aren't some new
truths to be found--

495
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:25,946
something to explain

496
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:28,366
how sometimes
fate delivers us

497
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:31,244
exactly where
we need to be.

498
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:34,872
Perhaps one day,
you'll even feel

499
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,583
the hand of God
on your shoulder.

500
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:40,502
You won't give a
millimeter, will you?

501
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,880
Look at you, still
in your uniform

502
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:45,925
wanting so badly to get
back to your station

503
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,843
with its
artificial gravity

504
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:49,553
and its sterilized air.

505
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,890
You are so disconnected

506
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:55,935
from your core
identity, Ben.

507
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:59,313
There is a better way.

508
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:02,524
How can we help you see it?

509
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:08,697
Perhaps good hard
work is the answer.

510
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:10,366
Vinod.

511
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:12,450
Yes, Mother?

512
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:14,661
Ben will be standing
watch tonight.

513
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,645
Are you all right,
Commander?

514
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:42,189
I'm a little tired,
but I'll be fine.

515
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:43,565
Any luck on your end?

516
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:46,610
This duonetic field
is still a mystery, sir.

517
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,570
I can't believe
it's being generated

518
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,697
by the astatine deposits
in the stream bed.

519
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:51,865
ALIXUS:
Good morning, Ben.

520
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:52,950
Ready
for some breakfast?

521
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,951
We have
some lovely fruit.

522
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,203
Try this.

523
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:57,455
We found it growing

524
00:24:57,495 --> 00:24:59,748
along the riverbank
a few years ago.

525
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,583
It's some kind
of native pear.

526
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,711
Oh, Ben, will you be able
to work your regular shift

527
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,130
in the field today?

528
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:07,714
What are you
talking about?

529
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,801
You just had him up all night,
standing watch.

530
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,304
Of course, if you'd like
to be relieved of your duties

531
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:15,306
all you have to do is ask.

532
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:17,266
I'll work my shift.

533
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:21,979
Good. We're so shorthanded
out there.

534
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:24,606
But you really should
do yourself a favor

535
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:27,525
and change into some
more comfortable clothes.

536
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:29,862
Oh, by the way, you'll
be pleased to know

537
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,323
Meg seems better this morning.

538
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:34,325
Joseph is very optimistic

539
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:38,078
about a new combination
of herbs he's trying.

540
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:53,593
We're picking up
a ship ahead.

541
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:56,805
It's the<i> Rio Grande,</i>
moving at warp 1.3.

542
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:58,682
Plotting an
intercept course.

543
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,642
Once we're abeam,
match our speeds exactly

544
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:01,685
and I'll transport over.

545
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:02,978
Like hell you will.

546
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,231
Sorry, I'm the
ranking officer here.

547
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:08,150
At warp, I wouldn't be
in such a hurry to volunteer.

548
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:10,236
You got a better idea?

549
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,238
I'm the science officer.

550
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,698
It's my job
to have a better idea.

551
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,116
(<i> sighs</i> )

552
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,538
What are you doing?

553
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,248
I'm trying
an old rope trick

554
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,665
I learned on Earth once.

555
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,667
A rope trick?

556
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,336
A very talented Hopi I knew

557
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:29,880
did things with a rope
you wouldn't believe.

558
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:32,716
It's an Old West American
artform.

559
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:36,970
You're suggesting we try to rope
the<i> Rio Grande</i> at warp.

560
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,556
With a tractor beam.

561
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:42,393
Once we pull it back to impulse,
isn't there a risk

562
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:45,479
that the strain
will rip both hulls apart?

563
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:47,314
If the ship assembly teams
back at the yards

564
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:50,526
did their jobs really well,
we'll probably make it.

565
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:52,152
If they had an off day,

566
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:53,362
we're going
to have a problem,

567
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:55,155
but it's our best shot.

568
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:58,451
Unless, as a ranking officer,
you have a better idea.

569
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:07,667
We're within tractor range.

570
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:11,297
Locking on.

571
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:19,305
Engaging
impulse engines.

572
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,354
(<i> metal straining and creaking)</i>

573
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,745
(<i> sighs</i> )

574
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:49,918
Remind me to send
a thank-you note

575
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,587
to the assembly teams.

576
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,965
All stop.

577
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,551
Computer, ready
transporter.

578
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:03,723
(<i> clanging</i> )

579
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,396
Meg has died.

580
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:14,485
Suddenly, quietly.

581
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:19,072
No one was prouder
of what we've accomplished here

582
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,241
than Meg was.

583
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:23,494
Her dedication
to this community

584
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:26,330
and to us, was an inspiration

585
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:32,294
which is why I find myself
so troubled today by an act

586
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:33,504
that by its very nature

587
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:36,882
defiles her memory.

588
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,467
Vinod.

589
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:43,847
All of us have welcomed

590
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,766
our new arrivals
with open arms

591
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:49,520
but they continue
to reject us.

592
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:51,522
Despite their
agreement

593
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:55,067
to respect our
fundamental
way of life,

594
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:57,194
this man has committed
the worst offense

595
00:28:57,236 --> 00:29:00,030
that can be committed
against this community.

596
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:04,284
He has selfishly
wasted precious time

597
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:07,663
that could have been
put to productive use.

598
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:09,289
Miles was discovered

599
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:12,918
trying to activate his
technological devices

600
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:15,295
so he could return
to his ship.

601
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:16,714
Alixus, I'm sure

602
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,757
he only wanted to get
to the medical equipment

603
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,384
which might have saved
Meg's life.

604
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:22,720
Thank you, Joseph.

605
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,138
I knew you would
feel that way

606
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,892
and I'm glad you said it,
so that all of us could see

607
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:32,020
the true danger
these two represent.

608
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:34,481
Our very own Joseph

609
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:37,025
defending what
he knows is wrong.

610
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:39,903
He knows that if we
had spent our energy

611
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:42,615
all these years,
trying to escape

612
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:44,575
we'd all be dead today.

613
00:29:44,617 --> 00:29:46,326
This is good.

614
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,412
This is a test
of our convictions

615
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:50,581
and we will survive.

616
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:53,417
(<i> metal clanking</i> )

617
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,669
You're not going
to put him in there.

618
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:57,212
No, Ben, I'm not.

619
00:29:57,254 --> 00:30:00,132
You are his commanding officer.

620
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:03,761
I hold you responsible
for his actions.

621
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,763
I'm putting you in there.

622
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,139
Wait a minute.

623
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:23,674
No signs of resistance.

624
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:25,175
None of the on-board weapons
has been fired.

625
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:26,468
But the logs have been erased.

626
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,803
Someone else
must have been here.

627
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:31,056
Maybe Sisko and
O'Brien beamed off

628
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,516
before the ship
was boarded.

629
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:34,142
But then why
would somebody

630
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:35,977
send the runabout
off at warp?

631
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,564
Why wouldn't they just
keep it or destroy it?

632
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:39,815
I think they were
trying to destroy it.

633
00:31:39,857 --> 00:31:41,274
How can you tell?

634
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,402
The hull's been exposed
to high temperatures

635
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:44,903
and intense
gamma radiation.

636
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:47,947
If we retrace the
<i>Rio Grande's</i> course

637
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,116
it takes us
right back to...

638
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,577
An F-type star.

639
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:52,745
Orellius Minor.

640
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:54,913
There's only one way

641
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,122
the ship could
only be coming

642
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,750
straight from
Orellius Minor,

643
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:58,917
and that's if someone
tried to destroy the ship

644
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,043
by flying it
into the star.

645
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:01,294
And missed.

646
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,338
If the trajectory
were slightly off

647
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:06,341
the star's gravity flux
would have deflected it

648
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:08,427
in a new direction.

649
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:11,430
Computer, send a tractor beam
to the<i> Orinoco.</i>

650
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:12,639
Prepare for a warp tow.

651
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:13,891
With a little luck

652
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,726
we'll be able to find
the warp signature

653
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:18,144
the engines left
when they were fired up.

654
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,146
Tractor beam in place.

655
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:23,233
Course laid in for
the Orellius system.

656
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:24,818
Engaging warp engines.

657
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,296
Please.

658
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:55,766
This is painful
for me, too.

659
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:58,059
I want so much
to give you water

660
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,937
to let you lie down

661
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:03,607
to sleep, but I can't.

662
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:05,943
Not without your help.

663
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:09,112
I know it's
too difficult

664
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:10,196
to speak right now.

665
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:13,158
Just rest.

666
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,333
Change doesn't come

667
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,376
easy to you, Ben.

668
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:24,753
I realize it.

669
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:27,840
Believe me,
I'm not expecting

670
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:30,008
some sudden,
miraculous conversion.

671
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:32,970
Change will come by itself,
if you're open to it.

672
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,221
But you do have
to show us

673
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,223
that you're open to it.

674
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:41,060
A good start would be
to get rid of the uniform.

675
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:50,988
I'll leave you these clothes.

676
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:56,535
Once you've changed,
you can have this water.

677
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:08,338
Join us, Ben.

678
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,932
Miles.

679
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,063
What are you doing here?

680
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:51,524
I need your help, Joseph.

681
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,151
With what?

682
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:57,280
(<i> sighs</i> )

683
00:35:57,322 --> 00:36:00,199
There's nothing I can do,
so please, don't ask me.

684
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,994
I've got to
try to track down

685
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:04,370
where that duonetic field
is coming from.

686
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:08,041
We told you, there
are astatine deposits.

687
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,542
That's not what's causing it.

688
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,128
If it were, I'd have
that transmitter running

689
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,963
and we'd all be out of here
already.

690
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:15,590
It's got to be something else.

691
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:18,301
And I think I figured a way
to get me to the source of it.

692
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,763
And you want me
to look the other way

693
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:23,765
while you leave.

694
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:27,226
She'd put you in the box,
wouldn't she?

695
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:30,271
Then do me a favor.

696
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:34,192
Look down at that hematite
deposit I just discovered.

697
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,568
Miles...

698
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,738
I can do it so it
won't hurt at all.

699
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,511
(<i> thud</i> )

700
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:04,222
I owe you one, my friend.

Well, you finally got one of us
out of our uniform.

O'BRIEN:
Come on, move it.

00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:18,731
Where's Alixus?

706
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,317
Get her out here.

is working now?

00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:49,221
Because I shut down
the duonetic field

712
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:51,264
that was stopping it
from working.

713
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:53,892
An artificially created
duonetic field.

714
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:57,770
Sisko to<i> Rio Grande.</i>

715
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:01,691
Computer, respond.

716
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:04,485
Your ship is no longer
in orbit, Ben.

717
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:07,113
I destroyed it.

718
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:12,785
I assume that means you control
the duonetic field.

719
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,829
I helped invent it.

720
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:16,664
You'd be surprised
how many scientists

721
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:19,834
are sympathetic
to my philosophies.

722
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:21,419
Then it was no accident

723
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,630
we developed life-support
problems near this planet.

724
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,466
No, we were always
on our way here, Joseph.

725
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,510
I chose it months
in advance.

726
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:32,389
It was far away
from any trade route,

727
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,724
completely isolated.

728
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:38,770
It was perfect for our...
ideal community.

729
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:43,691
I hoped when we landed
we would never leave here.

730
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:45,402
CASSANDRA:
You lied to us.

731
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:49,530
You've been lying to us
for ten years.

732
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,908
Yes, but perhaps
a lie can lead

733
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,077
to a more
important truth.

734
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,162
Would any of you
have learned

735
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:57,372
who you really are

736
00:40:57,414 --> 00:40:58,998
at the core

737
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,334
if you hadn't
have come here?

738
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:04,462
Joseph, you would
have been a repairman

739
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:07,257
all of your life.

740
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:10,176
Cassandra, you would have
been a technical clerk

741
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:13,096
in some closed-in room.

742
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:15,932
And, Stephan, my friend

743
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:19,978
you probably would have
been in prison by now.

744
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,439
Look at yourselves!

745
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,651
Look at what you've become!

746
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:33,699
What you've achieved here
has redefined your potential--

747
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:38,830
the potential of man--

748
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:42,208
just as I knew it would.

749
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:45,544
You are the living proof.

750
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:47,755
What of the dead?

751
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:52,677
What of Meg and the others?

752
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:59,600
Only my son knows
how I have suffered

753
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,312
as I watched each of them die.

754
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:05,690
You were willing to let them die
for your theories.

755
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:09,068
You're going to have to answer
for what you've done.

756
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:12,030
I'm prepared
to go with you.

757
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:14,949
Casualties were
inevitable.

758
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:18,619
I had to accept that
from the start.

759
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:21,956
What if it were your son
who had been sick?

760
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:24,083
Would you let him die, too?

761
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:31,341
Yes.

762
00:42:31,383 --> 00:42:33,885
For the sake
of the community.

763
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:39,682
I did it all
for the community.

764
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:46,439
Kira to Sisko.
Are you all right, Commander?

765
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:51,986
Everything is...
under control, Major.

766
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:54,989
Stand by to begin
multiple transports.

767
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:57,283
Acknowledged.

768
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:59,744
We have room for all of you
on the runabout.

769
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:03,706
If you have anything
you want to bring with you

770
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:04,999
you ought to get it now.

771
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:07,877
JOSEPH:
Miles...

772
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:11,964
this is our home.

773
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:16,052
Whatever Alixus may be
]guilty of

774
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:19,597
she did give us our community.

775
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:22,975
I'm not sure if we'll
leave the device

776
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:26,396
on or off, now that
we know it's there.

777
00:43:26,438 --> 00:43:28,731
And we'll have to decide

778
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:33,152
if we want to establish contact
with the outside world.

779
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:37,323
But Alixus is right.

780
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:42,661
We have found something here

781
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:45,664
that none of us is willing
to give up.

782
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:49,794
It's time for those of us
who don't belong here

783
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:51,796
to leave, Ben.

784
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,602
Four to beam
up, Major.

785
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,736
Come, come.
