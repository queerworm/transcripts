1
00:00:02,531 --> 00:00:06,405
Station Log, Stardate 47573.1.

2
00:00:06,441 --> 00:00:07,535
To respond to questions

3
00:00:07,578 --> 00:00:09,708
about setting up colonies
near the wormhole

4
00:00:09,751 --> 00:00:13,922
Chief O'Brien and I have set out
to survey nearby star systems.

5
00:00:13,961 --> 00:00:16,195
If it's an imposition...

6
00:00:16,301 --> 00:00:17,634
No, sir, it's fine.

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,802
You're sure?

8
00:00:19,843 --> 00:00:21,005
I'm sure, Commander.

9
00:00:21,047 --> 00:00:23,211
Jake's a good fellow.

10
00:00:23,319 --> 00:00:25,222
I'll enjoy working with him.

11
00:00:25,257 --> 00:00:27,353
I don't want you to make it
easy for him, Chief.

12
00:00:27,396 --> 00:00:30,427
He has to know what it takes
to make it in Starfleet.

13
00:00:30,471 --> 00:00:32,374
I'll have him
up to his elbows

14
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:33,935
in thorium grease, sir.

15
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:35,677
It's not going
to be easy for him.

16
00:00:35,718 --> 00:00:38,020
He placed in the lower
third of his age group

17
00:00:38,057 --> 00:00:39,253
in mechanical aptitude.

18
00:00:39,294 --> 00:00:40,695
Oh, good for him.

19
00:00:40,731 --> 00:00:41,700
So did I.

20
00:00:41,734 --> 00:00:43,728
You? Come on.

21
00:00:43,772 --> 00:00:45,036
No, it's true.

22
00:00:45,075 --> 00:00:47,411
It wasn't until I got
to the Cardassian front

23
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:49,784
I found out I had talents
I never knew I had.

24
00:00:49,821 --> 00:00:50,847
At the front?

25
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,690
It was a matter of figuring out

26
00:00:52,728 --> 00:00:56,192
how to get a field transporter
operational in ten minutes

27
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:59,006
or wind up being
a Cardassian prisoner of war.

28
00:00:59,044 --> 00:01:02,884
Now, I didn't know a transporter
from a turbolift in those days

29
00:01:02,922 --> 00:01:05,258
but somehow,
in nine minutes, 53 seconds

30
00:01:05,327 --> 00:01:07,856
I got that thing to work.

31
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:11,171
I got 13 men safely
off the surface of Setlik III.

32
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,270
Next thing I know

33
00:01:12,313 --> 00:01:14,181
I'm the tactical officer
on the <i>Rutledge.</i>

34
00:01:14,218 --> 00:01:16,212
That's how I got the gold suit.

35
00:01:16,256 --> 00:01:18,888
Well, Jake is ready
for a new suit, too.

36
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,927
The boy seems to grow
a centimeter each week.

37
00:01:21,971 --> 00:01:24,739
You know, he struck me out
with a curve ball the other day.

38
00:01:24,778 --> 00:01:25,838
First time.

39
00:01:25,881 --> 00:01:29,151
They grow up in a hurry,
don't they, sir?

40
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:30,658
That they do.

41
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:34,695
I think I've got one.

42
00:01:34,737 --> 00:01:37,005
Computer, set a new heading.

43
00:01:37,043 --> 00:01:39,071
41 mark 301.

44
00:01:39,115 --> 00:01:41,349
Confirmed.

45
00:01:41,455 --> 00:01:43,323
It's an M-Class, all right.

46
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,493
160 million kilometers
from Orellius Minor.

47
00:01:46,535 --> 00:01:49,703
Should be a perfect place
to set up a colony.

48
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:52,477
Mm-hmm, but it looks like
someone's beaten us to it.

49
00:01:52,517 --> 00:01:54,181
You're reading life-forms?

50
00:01:54,221 --> 00:01:55,656
Human life-forms.

51
00:01:55,692 --> 00:01:58,096
I don't see anything
on the books

52
00:01:58,132 --> 00:02:00,970
about a colony
in the Orellius system.

53
00:02:01,005 --> 00:02:02,839
Trying all hailing frequencies.

54
00:02:02,877 --> 00:02:05,281
Moving into synchronous orbit.

55
00:02:05,317 --> 00:02:07,185
No response.

56
00:02:07,221 --> 00:02:11,027
I'm picking up some kind of low-
level duonetic field down there.

57
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:13,469
It may be blocking
communications.

58
00:02:13,504 --> 00:02:16,306
Let's introduce ourselves
to our neighbors.

59
00:02:27,842 --> 00:02:29,141
Yours, too?

60
00:02:29,178 --> 00:02:31,742
Even the self-diagnostics
aren't working.

61
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:33,186
Just plain dead.

62
00:02:34,191 --> 00:02:36,059
Sisko to <i>Rio Grande.</i>

63
00:02:36,096 --> 00:02:37,862
Computer, respond.

64
00:02:40,207 --> 00:02:43,443
I'd say there's no EM activity
at all around here.

65
00:02:43,482 --> 00:02:44,678
Any idea why?

66
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:45,779
I'm not sure.

67
00:02:45,822 --> 00:02:47,291
But it might have
something to do

68
00:02:47,325 --> 00:02:50,458
with that duonetic field
our sensors picked up.

69
00:02:50,567 --> 00:02:51,661
Well, I hope you find

70
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,698
a few more of those talents
you never knew you had

71
00:02:53,743 --> 00:02:55,235
because, if you don't,
we're going to have

72
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,374
a hard time getting off this...

73
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:57,908
Don't move!

74
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,358
And put your hands up!

75
00:05:03,457 --> 00:05:04,983
Turn around...

76
00:05:05,027 --> 00:05:06,223
slowly.

77
00:05:14,953 --> 00:05:17,152
They're from Starfleet.

78
00:05:17,193 --> 00:05:18,423
That's right.

79
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,229
Mind if we put our hands down?

80
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:23,734
Well, the uniforms
have changed...

81
00:05:23,776 --> 00:05:27,274
or have I just forgotten
what they look like?

82
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,481
My name is Joseph.

83
00:05:28,522 --> 00:05:31,017
Vinod's the one playing
with the sharp object.

84
00:05:31,062 --> 00:05:33,694
I'm Benjamin Sisko
and this is Miles O'Brien.

85
00:05:33,735 --> 00:05:35,034
How did you get here?

86
00:05:35,072 --> 00:05:36,975
We were going to ask you
the same thing.

87
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,844
We were surveying
for habitable planets

88
00:05:38,882 --> 00:05:40,944
when our sensors picked
up your life signs.

89
00:05:40,988 --> 00:05:42,925
There was no record
of a human colony here.

90
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:45,329
Well, our group was on its way
to settle on Gemulon V

91
00:05:45,366 --> 00:05:46,335
over ten years ago

92
00:05:46,368 --> 00:05:48,602
when our ship developed
life support problems

93
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:50,441
and we had to land here
for repairs.

94
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,541
Once we got here,
all our systems failed.

95
00:05:52,584 --> 00:05:53,883
Nothing worked anymore.

96
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:55,049
So we've seen.

97
00:05:55,091 --> 00:05:56,651
We've been stuck here
ever since.

98
00:05:56,695 --> 00:05:58,825
And I guess you are, too, now.

99
00:05:58,867 --> 00:05:59,858
We have a ship in orbit.

100
00:05:59,903 --> 00:06:01,703
It won't take our people
long to find us.

101
00:06:01,742 --> 00:06:03,542
We'll be able
to get you all out of here.

102
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,984
Well, after ten years,
this is our home.

103
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:09,984
But you just said it yourself...
nothing works.

104
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:11,555
Well, we still do.

105
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:13,629
Well, come, we'll show you.

106
00:06:13,672 --> 00:06:17,078
Vinod, run ahead
and tell your mother, uh...

107
00:06:17,114 --> 00:06:18,310
we have guests.

108
00:06:19,688 --> 00:06:20,679
Come.

109
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:37,625
Erewon-class
personnel transport.

110
00:06:37,668 --> 00:06:39,502
Commissioned the <i>Santa Maria.</i>

111
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:41,738
Now we just call it "the cabin."

112
00:06:45,422 --> 00:06:48,190
After all this time... visitors!

113
00:06:48,229 --> 00:06:51,567
Alixus, meet Ben and Miles.

114
00:06:51,605 --> 00:06:54,738
Welcome to our community.

115
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:56,078
Miles.

116
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:57,210
Are there others?

117
00:06:57,286 --> 00:06:59,314
Just an empty runabout in orbit.

118
00:06:59,358 --> 00:07:01,762
Hopefully, it will
attract some attention.

119
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:04,133
A runabout... is that some kind
of new Starfleet vessel?

120
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:07,076
Yeah, they commissioned
the first ones two years ago.

121
00:07:07,111 --> 00:07:08,979
They're a short-range
interstellar craft

122
00:07:09,016 --> 00:07:12,115
about a quarter the size
of your "cabin" there.

123
00:07:12,157 --> 00:07:14,185
I was the engineer
aboard the <i>Santa Maria.</i>

124
00:07:14,263 --> 00:07:17,135
You and Miles will have a lot
to talk about, Joseph.

125
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,300
I'm sure all of us have
questions for our guests.

126
00:07:19,343 --> 00:07:21,075
Who won the soccer matches
this year?

127
00:07:21,114 --> 00:07:22,674
Is Golanga still playing?

128
00:07:22,718 --> 00:07:24,518
No, he hurt his knee
four years ago.

129
00:07:24,556 --> 00:07:26,220
They replaced it
with a bio-implant

130
00:07:26,328 --> 00:07:28,060
but he wasn't
the same after that.

131
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:30,002
Who was it that won
last year, anyway?

132
00:07:30,037 --> 00:07:31,097
I can never remember.

133
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,775
What are women's fashions like
back home now?

134
00:07:34,817 --> 00:07:36,788
Oh, well...

135
00:07:36,822 --> 00:07:38,952
Chief, you're the married one.

136
00:07:38,994 --> 00:07:40,258
Oh, Keiko, my wife

137
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:43,600
she's been replicating
longer dresses lately.

138
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,768
Oh, no, that means

139
00:07:44,809 --> 00:07:47,281
I'll have to alter
everything I own.

140
00:07:49,354 --> 00:07:52,054
Well, that may just be
the Bajoran styles

141
00:07:52,094 --> 00:07:53,724
she sees on Deep Space 9.

142
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:54,792
On Deep Space 9?

143
00:07:54,835 --> 00:07:55,997
I'm sure Ben and Miles

144
00:07:56,038 --> 00:07:58,602
will be happy to tell us
everything we want to know.

145
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,844
There will be plenty
of time for that later.

146
00:08:00,884 --> 00:08:02,787
Actually, the first
thing I'd like to do

147
00:08:02,822 --> 00:08:04,588
is try and get some response
from the EM systems.

148
00:08:04,627 --> 00:08:08,228
We gave up any hope
of that years ago.

149
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,267
Yes, we noticed a low-level
duonetic field in the area

150
00:08:11,378 --> 00:08:12,813
before we transported down.

151
00:08:12,848 --> 00:08:14,010
Yes, the same thing

152
00:08:14,051 --> 00:08:16,147
appeared on our sensors
when we were landing.

153
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:18,891
Our engines failed almost
the instant we hit the surface.

154
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:21,529
Without a functional tricorder

155
00:08:21,571 --> 00:08:23,907
it was virtually impossible
to track down the source.

156
00:08:23,944 --> 00:08:26,006
We do know that the
marshes all around us

157
00:08:26,049 --> 00:08:28,317
are filled
with astatine deposits.

158
00:08:28,355 --> 00:08:31,625
That's the only
explanation we have.

159
00:08:31,663 --> 00:08:35,332
But we've done pretty well
without our tricorders

160
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,505
EM converters and com links,
haven't we?

161
00:08:38,548 --> 00:08:42,012
After all, the human body
is a powerful tool.

162
00:08:42,057 --> 00:08:46,832
We can plow the crops,
harvest the fields

163
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:47,998
construct the walls

164
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,173
that we need for protection
against the wilderness.

165
00:08:51,215 --> 00:08:54,087
Weave the clothes that
we need to stay warm.

166
00:08:54,122 --> 00:08:56,184
In a way, we've rediscovered

167
00:08:56,228 --> 00:08:59,396
what man is capable of
without technology.

168
00:08:59,436 --> 00:09:01,339
It hasn't been easy.

169
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:04,210
We've had some bitter winters

170
00:09:04,248 --> 00:09:08,555
and... we've lost
some dear friends.

171
00:09:08,593 --> 00:09:12,626
But we're very proud
of what we've accomplished here.

172
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,368
You have every right to be.

173
00:09:14,475 --> 00:09:16,105
Are we all going to leave

174
00:09:16,145 --> 00:09:18,013
when the others come
to rescue them?

175
00:09:20,591 --> 00:09:22,255
That's something each of us

176
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,824
is going to have
to think about, isn't it?

177
00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:33,222
Are you going to leave, Alixus?

178
00:09:34,995 --> 00:09:37,091
Speaking for myself, no.

179
00:09:37,134 --> 00:09:39,002
No, I'll never leave.

180
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:43,540
And I'll never want what we have
in our community to change.

181
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,451
It means too much to me.

182
00:09:45,522 --> 00:09:47,254
But while you are here

183
00:09:47,293 --> 00:09:51,794
you are welcome to everything
our community has to offer.

184
00:09:51,838 --> 00:09:54,778
The only thing we ask
is that you contribute.

185
00:09:54,813 --> 00:09:56,477
We all work for our supper.

186
00:09:56,551 --> 00:09:57,645
You'd be surprised

187
00:09:57,687 --> 00:10:00,125
how much sweeter it tastes
when you do.

188
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,290
We'll be happy to do our part.

189
00:10:02,332 --> 00:10:05,933
Joseph, would you find them
some bunks, please?

190
00:10:12,593 --> 00:10:15,795
Two more strong,
healthy men, Vinod.

191
00:10:15,834 --> 00:10:20,107
That could mean an awful lot
to this community.

192
00:10:32,277 --> 00:10:34,715
Do you know an Admiral Mitsuya?

193
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,214
Best poker player in the fleet,
next to me.

194
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:39,923
Well, he's diverting
the <i>Crockett</i>

195
00:10:39,963 --> 00:10:42,458
to stop at DS9
day after tomorrow

196
00:10:42,503 --> 00:10:45,067
to talk about Cardassian
foreign policy?

197
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:48,051
That's just an excuse
to get Benjamin in a game.

198
00:10:48,084 --> 00:10:50,248
Mitsuya cleaned him out
last year.

199
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,193
We better hail the <i>Rio Grande</i>

200
00:10:52,229 --> 00:10:54,393
and get them
headed back this way.

201
00:10:54,434 --> 00:10:57,340
I've worked two lifetimes
on Benjamin's poker.

202
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,209
He just can't learn
how to bluff.

203
00:10:59,247 --> 00:11:00,739
That's odd.

204
00:11:00,784 --> 00:11:03,052
I know, you'd think
a man like Benjamin...

205
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,528
No, the <i>Rio Grande...</i>

206
00:11:05,563 --> 00:11:09,369
it's not responding
to our hails.

207
00:11:09,406 --> 00:11:10,602
Commander?

208
00:11:10,676 --> 00:11:11,975
Oh, come in, Chief.

209
00:11:12,014 --> 00:11:14,418
I was just reading
one of the books

210
00:11:14,452 --> 00:11:15,921
our host has written.

211
00:11:15,957 --> 00:11:18,259
Alixus is quite
a prolific author.

212
00:11:18,297 --> 00:11:21,601
Yeah, a bunch of these
were left in my room, too.

213
00:11:21,638 --> 00:11:24,304
I haven't had a chance
to look at them.

214
00:11:24,345 --> 00:11:26,179
What does she write about?

215
00:11:26,217 --> 00:11:30,159
She seems to have something
to say on just about everything.

216
00:11:30,194 --> 00:11:31,356
Yeah?

217
00:11:31,396 --> 00:11:34,164
Economic analysis,
political commentaries

218
00:11:34,204 --> 00:11:35,503
literary critiques.

219
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:39,483
She says she's spent her life
examining the human condition.

220
00:11:39,517 --> 00:11:40,679
And what's her prognosis?

221
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:42,017
Not very good.

222
00:11:42,057 --> 00:11:44,997
She says we have become
fat and lazy and dull.

223
00:11:45,032 --> 00:11:49,669
My wife told me something along
those lines just last week.

224
00:11:51,282 --> 00:11:54,723
"The common conceit that
the human species has evolved

225
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:57,697
"over the last several
centuries is ludicrous.

226
00:11:57,732 --> 00:11:59,292
"What gains we have made

227
00:11:59,336 --> 00:12:02,572
"have come at the cost
of our own core identities.

228
00:12:02,611 --> 00:12:05,209
Man has lost touch
with his true power."

229
00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:10,959
Sounds like it took
a crash landing

230
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,916
for her to find her paradise.

231
00:12:17,026 --> 00:12:18,724
Have you found anything
in their ship

232
00:12:18,764 --> 00:12:20,758
that can help us restore
contact with the runabout?

233
00:12:20,802 --> 00:12:22,796
There's nothing to find.

234
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:25,816
Wave guides,
conduits, baffle plates...

235
00:12:25,849 --> 00:12:27,683
you name it, it's gone.

236
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,814
The ship looks like

237
00:12:28,857 --> 00:12:30,953
it's been through
a Ferengi junkyard.

238
00:12:30,996 --> 00:12:32,329
What happened to it all?

239
00:12:32,366 --> 00:12:33,665
We threw it away.

240
00:12:33,703 --> 00:12:35,606
Well, since,
uh, none of it worked

241
00:12:35,641 --> 00:12:39,013
to us, it was merely useless
junk taking up space.

242
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:40,851
Alixus felt its presence

243
00:12:40,888 --> 00:12:44,226
was a constant reminder
of who you used to be.

244
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,759
Well, we all had to abandon
our dependence upon technology.

245
00:12:46,804 --> 00:12:48,399
Removing every trace of it...

246
00:12:48,475 --> 00:12:50,674
well, that made
the transition easier.

247
00:12:50,713 --> 00:12:52,809
As an engineer,
you must have had

248
00:12:52,853 --> 00:12:54,483
some problems with that.

249
00:12:56,095 --> 00:12:58,089
Well, I was the last convert.

250
00:12:58,133 --> 00:13:01,301
But, as time passed,
I realized Alixus was right.

251
00:13:01,341 --> 00:13:03,141
She was helping us discover

252
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:05,309
a new philosophy of life
together

253
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:09,591
because we needed one
to survive.

254
00:13:11,267 --> 00:13:14,001
And I'll tell you, every one
of us is better for it.

255
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,943
We are more committed
to each other.

256
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,214
We are truly a part
of each other's lives.

257
00:13:18,252 --> 00:13:20,918
We've renewed a sense
of community

258
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,726
that man left behind
centuries ago.

259
00:13:23,766 --> 00:13:27,230
Joseph, Meg's fever
is getting worse.

260
00:13:36,532 --> 00:13:39,472
The new herb doesn't seem
to be helping at all.

261
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,473
May I see?

262
00:13:40,543 --> 00:13:41,773
Please.

263
00:13:41,813 --> 00:13:45,219
We have an insect here
that transmits a disease

264
00:13:45,255 --> 00:13:47,249
we haven't found a cure for.

265
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:49,493
We've lost three to it already.

266
00:13:49,566 --> 00:13:51,264
Have you found
anything in the forest

267
00:13:51,304 --> 00:13:52,466
like the sleeper fungi?

268
00:13:52,507 --> 00:13:55,002
We've searched everywhere
for the right fungus or root

269
00:13:55,047 --> 00:13:56,607
that would draw out
the infection.

270
00:13:56,652 --> 00:13:57,746
If it keeps spreading

271
00:13:57,787 --> 00:14:00,727
she'll die
before the rescue team finds us.

272
00:14:00,762 --> 00:14:02,163
The medical kit in the runabout

273
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:03,863
could probably
take care of this in a second.

274
00:14:03,903 --> 00:14:05,065
We have got to find a way

275
00:14:05,107 --> 00:14:07,078
to restore the com link
to the transporter.

276
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:09,380
That would only be
a waste of time.

277
00:14:09,418 --> 00:14:12,256
This duonetic field
inhibits energy flow

278
00:14:12,292 --> 00:14:15,494
but a duonetic field
is a form of energy, too.

279
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:18,369
Maybe we could modify
our communicators

280
00:14:18,408 --> 00:14:20,311
to run on the field itself.

281
00:14:20,346 --> 00:14:21,645
Do you really think you could?

282
00:14:21,683 --> 00:14:22,548
No!

283
00:14:23,689 --> 00:14:26,754
If you want to put
your efforts to good use

284
00:14:26,797 --> 00:14:29,531
search the forest
for something else we might use.

285
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:30,799
This is primitive medicine.

286
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,332
You can't expect to save her...

287
00:14:32,378 --> 00:14:35,819
Ben! May I see you
outside, please?

288
00:14:37,858 --> 00:14:39,795
Talk like that isn't
constructive.

289
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,698
I'm talking
about saving the life

290
00:14:41,736 --> 00:14:43,137
of one of your followers.

291
00:14:43,172 --> 00:14:44,870
You don't understand this yet.

292
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,936
No one follows me.

293
00:14:45,979 --> 00:14:47,574
They follow their own hearts.

294
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:50,452
My heart tells me to try
to get back to my ship.

295
00:14:50,492 --> 00:14:51,586
I'm sure it does

296
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,189
but if we'd had that attitude
for the last ten years

297
00:14:54,234 --> 00:14:55,601
we wouldn't have been doing

298
00:14:55,671 --> 00:14:57,539
what was necessary
to survive here.

299
00:14:57,576 --> 00:15:01,313
To find the plants, herbs, molds
that cure disease.

300
00:15:01,353 --> 00:15:04,691
We've conquered 17 illnesses

301
00:15:04,728 --> 00:15:07,566
with the most powerful resource
man has...

302
00:15:07,602 --> 00:15:08,832
his ingenuity.

303
00:15:08,872 --> 00:15:10,364
An interesting philosophy.

304
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,779
And while we're debating
it, a woman is dying.

305
00:15:12,816 --> 00:15:15,254
We're doing everything
we can for her.

306
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,383
No, we're not.

307
00:15:16,425 --> 00:15:18,123
I won't have you disrupting

308
00:15:18,163 --> 00:15:21,137
everything this community
has worked for, Ben.

309
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:23,905
I don't intend to stay here
any longer than necessary.

310
00:15:23,945 --> 00:15:25,244
And that's another thing.

311
00:15:25,281 --> 00:15:28,414
Let's not bring up the Starfleet
rescue party again.

312
00:15:28,456 --> 00:15:30,620
Until they come... if they come...

313
00:15:30,662 --> 00:15:33,362
you'll have to do things
our way.

314
00:15:35,407 --> 00:15:39,578
I'd strongly advise
you get rid of that uniform.

315
00:15:39,619 --> 00:15:43,722
By mid-afternoon,
it gets hot in the fields.

316
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,773
The <i>Rio Grande's</i> been spotted.

317
00:16:02,812 --> 00:16:03,906
Where?

318
00:16:03,949 --> 00:16:06,217
Details are coming in
from Starfleet.

319
00:16:06,255 --> 00:16:07,781
The Romulan vessel <i>Gasko</i>

320
00:16:07,825 --> 00:16:10,195
reported seeing
an abandoned runabout.

321
00:16:10,231 --> 00:16:14,264
Markings NCC-72452.

322
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:16,404
That's our ship, all right.

323
00:16:16,448 --> 00:16:19,684
Traveling at warp 2
through sector 401.

324
00:16:19,789 --> 00:16:22,193
At warp, with no one on board?

325
00:16:22,229 --> 00:16:24,325
Command wants to know
if we can send someone

326
00:16:24,368 --> 00:16:25,337
to investigate.

327
00:16:25,371 --> 00:16:27,035
Signal them affirmative.

328
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,817
I already have.

329
00:16:30,852 --> 00:16:32,846
Runabout Pad C.

330
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:37,265
You've got a real
talent for this, Ben.

331
00:16:37,301 --> 00:16:39,603
Well, my father was a chef.

332
00:16:39,641 --> 00:16:42,307
He grew all his own vegetables.

333
00:16:42,348 --> 00:16:47,384
My brothers and I were sent out
to the gardens every day.

334
00:16:47,428 --> 00:16:48,488
Most of the others...

335
00:16:48,531 --> 00:16:50,161
they'd only eaten
replicated food

336
00:16:50,202 --> 00:16:51,262
before they got here.

337
00:16:51,305 --> 00:16:53,003
The flavor of the foods
we prepare

338
00:16:53,042 --> 00:16:54,511
was quite a surprise to them.

339
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:56,347
But not you?

340
00:16:56,385 --> 00:16:59,883
My mother would never
let me eat replicated food.

341
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:04,533
What?

342
00:17:04,573 --> 00:17:07,741
I can't help thinking
what my wife would say

343
00:17:07,848 --> 00:17:09,716
if she saw me doing this.

344
00:17:09,753 --> 00:17:11,052
Why?

345
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:14,188
Well, around my house, I'm
known as "the black thumb."

346
00:17:14,231 --> 00:17:16,465
I'm just one
of those people, you know.

347
00:17:16,504 --> 00:17:18,772
The only way I could get
anything to grow

348
00:17:18,877 --> 00:17:20,278
was to marry a botanist.

349
00:17:20,313 --> 00:17:21,646
Oh, a botanist, really?

350
00:17:21,683 --> 00:17:22,777
Yeah.

351
00:17:22,853 --> 00:17:24,152
You should have seen
the arboretum

352
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,250
she grew on the <i>Enterprise.</i>

353
00:17:25,293 --> 00:17:28,199
That's where I asked her
to marry me.

354
00:17:28,233 --> 00:17:29,999
Oh, she'd love it here.

355
00:17:30,038 --> 00:17:32,510
Maybe you'll bring her someday.

356
00:17:32,545 --> 00:17:34,037
Trouble is,
she wouldn't want to leave.

357
00:17:34,082 --> 00:17:35,712
That's okay, too.

358
00:17:42,504 --> 00:17:44,634
Come on.

359
00:17:44,677 --> 00:17:47,172
Reach in.

360
00:17:47,217 --> 00:17:48,186
Get my hand.

361
00:17:48,219 --> 00:17:49,188
Here we go.

362
00:17:49,222 --> 00:17:50,191
Good.

363
00:17:50,225 --> 00:17:51,216
Easy now.

364
00:18:00,986 --> 00:18:02,478
Get him into the shade.

365
00:18:13,752 --> 00:18:15,986
All right, sit him down there.

366
00:18:16,025 --> 00:18:17,255
Easy, easy.

367
00:18:17,295 --> 00:18:19,665
All right, here.
All right, here.

368
00:18:19,701 --> 00:18:21,865
Here, Stephan,
if you chew these

369
00:18:21,906 --> 00:18:24,538
they will help you
regain your strength.

370
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,312
What did he do to deserve this?

371
00:18:26,351 --> 00:18:28,049
He stole a candle.

372
00:18:28,089 --> 00:18:29,719
One candle?

373
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,888
How long was he in there?

374
00:18:30,997 --> 00:18:32,865
Since yesterday.

375
00:18:32,902 --> 00:18:35,602
In that hell box?

376
00:18:35,642 --> 00:18:38,308
Is this part of your philosophy
of life, too?

377
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,910
You're a Starfleet Commander.

378
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,753
I'm sure
you've had to discipline

379
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,919
members of your crew.

380
00:18:42,995 --> 00:18:44,294
Discipline is one thing.

381
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:45,391
Torture is another.

382
00:18:45,434 --> 00:18:48,168
The first thing
this community accepted

383
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,442
was the need to establish
rules of conduct.

384
00:18:50,481 --> 00:18:52,349
All of us, including Stephan

385
00:18:52,386 --> 00:18:54,756
approved this form
of punishment as necessary

386
00:18:54,792 --> 00:18:56,786
and fair.

387
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,858
How are you, Stephan?

388
00:19:02,145 --> 00:19:04,413
I'll be all right.

389
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:09,898
I'm sorry, Alixus,
that I let down the community.

390
00:19:10,031 --> 00:19:12,595
The matter is closed.

391
00:19:12,638 --> 00:19:13,902
Go inside.

392
00:19:13,941 --> 00:19:15,707
Get some rest now.

393
00:19:15,746 --> 00:19:18,720
Thank you, Alixus.

394
00:19:18,754 --> 00:19:20,053
Come on, easy.

395
00:19:20,091 --> 00:19:22,563
Easy.

396
00:19:22,597 --> 00:19:25,069
Stephan will never
steal another candle

397
00:19:25,104 --> 00:19:28,374
and neither will anyone else
who saw him here today.

398
00:19:28,412 --> 00:19:30,508
In time, you'll understand

399
00:19:30,551 --> 00:19:33,684
that this is a simple
and effective way

400
00:19:33,726 --> 00:19:36,632
to maintain law and order
in our community.

401
00:19:44,822 --> 00:19:46,656
I get the distinct impression

402
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:49,063
she expects us
to be here for a while.

403
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,803
If there is a way to adapt the
energy in the duonetic field

404
00:19:52,842 --> 00:19:54,836
to get us back to the runabout

405
00:19:54,881 --> 00:19:56,818
I want you to find it, Chief.

406
00:19:56,853 --> 00:19:58,345
Yes, sir.

407
00:20:13,563 --> 00:20:15,227
Is there anything you need?

408
00:20:16,403 --> 00:20:19,673
No, I don't think so.

409
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:25,521
I'm sorry, Alixus
doesn't believe in doors.

410
00:20:25,561 --> 00:20:28,535
We all take it for granted now.

411
00:20:28,569 --> 00:20:30,733
You'll get used to it.

412
00:20:30,774 --> 00:20:34,215
Hopefully, I won't be here
long enough to get used to it.

413
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,312
You don't like it here, do you?

414
00:20:36,355 --> 00:20:38,827
It's not what I'm used to.

415
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,388
Alixus has reminded us all

416
00:20:40,433 --> 00:20:42,962
that it wasn't easy
for us at first either.

417
00:20:43,006 --> 00:20:45,205
She's told us
to be patient with you.

418
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:46,544
Has she?

419
00:20:46,582 --> 00:20:50,354
Your muscles must be sore
from all the work today.

420
00:20:50,391 --> 00:20:53,593
This is an oil extract
from the Xupta tree.

421
00:20:53,701 --> 00:20:56,196
It's wonderfully soothing.

422
00:20:56,241 --> 00:20:58,371
Thanks, I'll try some.

423
00:20:58,412 --> 00:21:01,146
Would you like me
to massage you with it?

424
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,382
I don't think so.

425
00:21:04,428 --> 00:21:05,727
Thanks anyway.

426
00:21:08,071 --> 00:21:10,407
It'll make you feel
a lot better.

427
00:21:11,914 --> 00:21:13,714
Here, let me show you.

428
00:21:16,761 --> 00:21:19,063
Did she send you here?

429
00:21:21,139 --> 00:21:24,911
Did she send you here
to make love to me?

430
00:21:33,771 --> 00:21:35,742
Ben, come in.

431
00:21:35,776 --> 00:21:40,915
I was just writing about you
and Miles in my journal.

432
00:21:40,956 --> 00:21:43,155
I understand
you're quite a chef.

433
00:21:46,002 --> 00:21:47,905
That's the first core behavior

434
00:21:47,941 --> 00:21:50,311
I've seen from you
since you arrived.

435
00:21:50,347 --> 00:21:51,373
Core behavior.

436
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:53,012
Does that chapter come

437
00:21:53,055 --> 00:21:55,653
before or after
sexual procurement?

438
00:21:55,695 --> 00:21:57,963
I assume you're talking
about Cassandra?

439
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,994
Did you send her to my room?

440
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:01,235
Yes.

441
00:22:01,276 --> 00:22:03,179
I think you're contemptible.

442
00:22:03,214 --> 00:22:04,809
Interesting.

443
00:22:04,851 --> 00:22:07,380
Contemptible.

444
00:22:07,425 --> 00:22:10,297
Try and see it
through our eyes

445
00:22:10,332 --> 00:22:12,531
just for a moment, Ben.

446
00:22:12,572 --> 00:22:16,013
Cassandra came to me;
she was worried.

447
00:22:16,047 --> 00:22:19,146
She sensed
that you weren't happy.

448
00:22:19,189 --> 00:22:20,658
She was right about that.

449
00:22:20,693 --> 00:22:23,165
She was concerned
that all you see here

450
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,635
is work and hardship

451
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:27,701
and she wanted you to share
in our joy as well.

452
00:22:27,744 --> 00:22:30,478
So you sent her to me to win
my devotion to your cause.

453
00:22:30,518 --> 00:22:33,390
I suggested she might
make it easier for you

454
00:22:33,426 --> 00:22:34,895
to become a member
of our community.

455
00:22:34,929 --> 00:22:36,991
The choice was hers.

456
00:22:37,035 --> 00:22:39,907
Cassandra really likes you, Ben.

457
00:22:42,817 --> 00:22:47,318
It's fortunate that all these
books of yours aren't on padds

458
00:22:47,362 --> 00:22:50,895
like the other materials
the colonists brought.

459
00:22:50,938 --> 00:22:53,034
I used to print them myself.

460
00:22:53,076 --> 00:22:54,238
I'm not surprised.

461
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,650
Vinod tells me that you never
ate replicated food

462
00:22:56,686 --> 00:22:58,053
before you came here.

463
00:22:58,089 --> 00:23:02,830
I'm not sure
I see the connection.

464
00:23:02,869 --> 00:23:05,741
It's just that you
never had much use

465
00:23:05,777 --> 00:23:07,680
for technology, did you?

466
00:23:07,715 --> 00:23:10,746
It's interesting how you
happened to crash on a planet

467
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,285
that fit your philosophy
of life so well.

468
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,526
I agree.

469
00:23:14,566 --> 00:23:16,970
In fact, I've started
writing a book

470
00:23:17,006 --> 00:23:18,498
about our experiences.

471
00:23:18,543 --> 00:23:19,773
I've been wondering

472
00:23:19,846 --> 00:23:22,216
if, in the ancient
religions of man

473
00:23:22,252 --> 00:23:24,246
there aren't some new
truths to be found...

474
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:26,057
something to explain

475
00:23:26,096 --> 00:23:31,543
how sometimes fate delivers us
exactly where we need to be.

476
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:34,608
Perhaps one day,
you'll even feel

477
00:23:34,652 --> 00:23:37,785
the hand of God
on your shoulder.

478
00:23:37,826 --> 00:23:40,594
You won't give a millimeter,
will you?

479
00:23:40,633 --> 00:23:43,105
Look at you,
still in your uniform

480
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:46,137
wanting so badly to get
back to your station

481
00:23:46,181 --> 00:23:49,714
with its artificial gravity
and its sterilized air.

482
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:56,101
You are so disconnected
from your core identity, Ben.

483
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,410
There is a better way.

484
00:23:59,449 --> 00:24:02,855
How can we help you see it?

485
00:24:04,395 --> 00:24:08,839
Perhaps good hard
work is the answer.

486
00:24:08,873 --> 00:24:10,571
Vinod.

487
00:24:10,611 --> 00:24:12,479
Yes, Mother?

488
00:24:12,516 --> 00:24:14,988
Ben will be standing
watch tonight.

489
00:24:38,818 --> 00:24:40,482
Are you all right, Commander?

490
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:43,017
I'm a little tired,
but I'll be fine.

491
00:24:43,062 --> 00:24:44,326
Any luck on your end?

492
00:24:44,365 --> 00:24:47,271
This duonetic field
is still a mystery, sir.

493
00:24:47,307 --> 00:24:49,175
I can't believe
it's being generated

494
00:24:49,212 --> 00:24:51,514
by the astatine deposits
in the stream bed.

495
00:24:51,551 --> 00:24:52,611
Good morning, Ben.

496
00:24:52,653 --> 00:24:53,679
Ready for some breakfast?

497
00:24:53,723 --> 00:24:54,885
We have some lovely fruit.

498
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:57,056
Try this.

499
00:24:57,099 --> 00:24:58,295
We found it growing

500
00:24:58,336 --> 00:25:00,638
along the riverbank
a few years ago.

501
00:25:00,674 --> 00:25:02,269
It's some kind of native pear.

502
00:25:02,312 --> 00:25:05,445
Oh, Ben, will you be able
to work your regular shift

503
00:25:05,487 --> 00:25:06,786
in the field today?

504
00:25:06,824 --> 00:25:08,454
What are you talking about?

505
00:25:08,495 --> 00:25:11,401
You just had him up all night,
standing watch.

506
00:25:11,435 --> 00:25:13,930
Of course, if you'd like
to be relieved of your duties

507
00:25:13,975 --> 00:25:15,535
all you have to do is ask.

508
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,380
I'll work my shift.

509
00:25:17,418 --> 00:25:22,125
Good. We're so shorthanded
out there.

510
00:25:22,164 --> 00:25:24,796
But you really should
do yourself a favor

511
00:25:24,837 --> 00:25:27,811
and change into some
more comfortable clothes.

512
00:25:27,845 --> 00:25:30,079
Oh, by the way, you'll
be pleased to know

513
00:25:30,117 --> 00:25:32,555
Meg seems better this morning.

514
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,618
Joseph is very optimistic

515
00:25:34,663 --> 00:25:38,298
about a new combination
of herbs he's trying.

516
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:53,841
We're picking up a ship ahead.

517
00:25:53,879 --> 00:25:57,047
It's the <i>Rio Grande,</i>
moving at warp 1.3.

518
00:25:57,087 --> 00:25:58,921
Plotting an intercept course.

519
00:25:58,959 --> 00:26:00,896
Once we're abeam,
match our speeds exactly

520
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:01,990
and I'll transport over.

521
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,160
Like hell you will.

522
00:26:03,203 --> 00:26:04,695
Sorry,
I'm the ranking officer here.

523
00:26:04,741 --> 00:26:08,410
At warp, I wouldn't be
in such a hurry to volunteer.

524
00:26:08,451 --> 00:26:10,014
You got a better idea?

525
00:26:10,147 --> 00:26:11,879
I'm the science officer.

526
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,585
It's my job
to have a better idea.

527
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:20,265
What are you doing?

528
00:26:20,307 --> 00:26:23,543
I'm trying an old rope trick
I learned on Earth once.

529
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,315
A rope trick?

530
00:26:25,354 --> 00:26:26,914
A very talented Hopi I knew

531
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:29,556
did things with a rope
you wouldn't believe.

532
00:26:29,664 --> 00:26:32,432
It's an Old West American
art form.

533
00:26:32,472 --> 00:26:36,882
You're suggesting we try to rope
the <i>Rio Grande</i> at warp.

534
00:26:36,917 --> 00:26:38,352
With a tractor beam.

535
00:26:38,387 --> 00:26:42,193
Once we pull it back to impulse,
isn't there a risk

536
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:45,363
that the strain
will rip both hulls apart?

537
00:26:45,406 --> 00:26:47,570
If the ship assembly teams
back at the yards

538
00:26:47,611 --> 00:26:50,243
did their jobs really well,
we'll probably make it.

539
00:26:50,285 --> 00:26:53,259
If they had an off day,
we're going to have a problem

540
00:26:53,293 --> 00:26:54,819
but it's our best shot.

541
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:58,362
Unless as a ranking officer,
you have a better idea.

542
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:07,490
We're within tractor range.

543
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,996
Locking on.

544
00:27:16,721 --> 00:27:19,216
Engaging impulse engines.

545
00:27:47,367 --> 00:27:49,805
Remind me to send
a thank-you note

546
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:51,503
to the assembly teams.

547
00:27:53,215 --> 00:27:54,707
All stop.

548
00:27:54,785 --> 00:27:57,485
Computer, ready transporter.

549
00:28:06,817 --> 00:28:09,289
Meg has died.

550
00:28:09,324 --> 00:28:12,959
Suddenly, quietly.

551
00:28:12,999 --> 00:28:17,706
No one was prouder
of what we've accomplished here

552
00:28:17,812 --> 00:28:19,715
than Meg was.

553
00:28:19,817 --> 00:28:23,520
Her dedication
to this community

554
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,466
and to us, was an inspiration

555
00:28:26,501 --> 00:28:32,346
which is why I find myself
so troubled today by an act

556
00:28:32,383 --> 00:28:37,020
that, by its very nature,
defiles her memory.

557
00:28:37,062 --> 00:28:38,657
Vinod.

558
00:28:42,743 --> 00:28:46,776
All of us have welcomed
our new arrivals with open arms

559
00:28:46,888 --> 00:28:49,656
but they continue to reject us.

560
00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:51,723
Despite their agreement

561
00:28:51,766 --> 00:28:55,104
to respect
our fundamental way of life

562
00:28:55,142 --> 00:28:57,410
this man has committed
the worst offense

563
00:28:57,448 --> 00:29:00,012
that can be committed
against this community.

564
00:29:00,055 --> 00:29:04,499
He has selfishly
wasted precious time

565
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:07,906
that could have been
put to productive use.

566
00:29:07,942 --> 00:29:09,502
Miles was discovered

567
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:13,011
trying to activate
his technological devices

568
00:29:13,055 --> 00:29:15,459
so he could return to his ship.

569
00:29:15,495 --> 00:29:16,794
Alixus, I'm sure

570
00:29:16,831 --> 00:29:19,065
he only wanted to get
to the medical equipment

571
00:29:19,104 --> 00:29:20,734
which might have saved
Meg's life.

572
00:29:20,776 --> 00:29:23,010
Thank you, Joseph.

573
00:29:23,048 --> 00:29:25,247
I knew you would feel that way

574
00:29:25,287 --> 00:29:29,161
and I'm glad you said it,
so that all of us could see

575
00:29:29,197 --> 00:29:32,262
the true danger
these two represent.

576
00:29:32,305 --> 00:29:34,709
Our very own Joseph

577
00:29:34,745 --> 00:29:37,081
defending
what he knows is wrong.

578
00:29:37,118 --> 00:29:39,990
He knows that if we
had spent our energy

579
00:29:40,025 --> 00:29:42,793
all these years,
trying to escape

580
00:29:42,833 --> 00:29:44,861
we'd all be dead today.

581
00:29:44,971 --> 00:29:46,601
This is good.

582
00:29:46,643 --> 00:29:48,773
This is a test
of our convictions

583
00:29:48,815 --> 00:29:50,979
and we will survive.

584
00:29:53,694 --> 00:29:56,064
You're not going
to put him in there.

585
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,433
No, Ben, I'm not.

586
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:00,467
You are his commanding officer.

587
00:30:00,512 --> 00:30:03,918
I hold you responsible
for his actions.

588
00:30:03,988 --> 00:30:06,118
I'm putting you in there.

589
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,561
Wait a minute.

590
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:23,594
No signs of resistance.

591
00:31:23,628 --> 00:31:25,496
None of the on-board weapons
has been fired.

592
00:31:25,532 --> 00:31:26,728
But the logs have been erased.

593
00:31:26,769 --> 00:31:28,136
Someone else
must have been here.

594
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:31,478
Maybe Sisko and
O'Brien beamed off

595
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:33,041
before the ship was boarded.

596
00:31:33,085 --> 00:31:36,253
But then why would somebody
send the runabout off at warp?

597
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:38,823
Why wouldn't they just
keep it or destroy it?

598
00:31:38,867 --> 00:31:40,359
I think they were
trying to destroy it.

599
00:31:40,405 --> 00:31:41,704
How can you tell?

600
00:31:41,741 --> 00:31:43,905
The hull's been exposed
to high temperatures

601
00:31:43,947 --> 00:31:45,348
and intense gamma radiation.

602
00:31:45,384 --> 00:31:48,358
If we retrace the
<i>Rio Grande's</i> course

603
00:31:48,392 --> 00:31:50,454
it takes us right back to...

604
00:31:50,497 --> 00:31:52,057
An F-type star.

605
00:31:52,101 --> 00:31:53,127
Orellius Minor.

606
00:31:53,237 --> 00:31:55,471
There's only one way

607
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,606
the ship could be coming
straight from Orellius Minor

608
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:59,483
and that's if someone
tried to destroy the ship

609
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,614
by flying it into the star.

610
00:32:00,657 --> 00:32:01,717
And missed.

611
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,788
If the trajectory
were slightly off

612
00:32:03,832 --> 00:32:06,634
the star's gravity flux
would have deflected it

613
00:32:06,673 --> 00:32:07,869
in a new direction.

614
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:11,678
Computer, send a tractor beam
to the <i>Orinoco.</i>

615
00:32:11,719 --> 00:32:12,983
Prepare for a warp tow.

616
00:32:13,023 --> 00:32:14,117
With a little luck

617
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:15,891
we'll be able to find
the warp signature

618
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:18,425
the engines left
when they were fired up.

619
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,441
Tractor beam in place.

620
00:32:20,475 --> 00:32:23,506
Course laid in
for the Orellius system.

621
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,316
Engaging warp engines.

622
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,735
Please.

623
00:32:53,327 --> 00:32:56,199
This is painful for me, too.

624
00:32:56,235 --> 00:32:58,399
I want so much to give you water

625
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,377
to let you lie down

626
00:33:00,412 --> 00:33:03,339
to sleep, but I can't.

627
00:33:03,471 --> 00:33:05,705
Not without your help.

628
00:33:07,181 --> 00:33:09,983
I know it's too difficult
to speak right now.

629
00:33:10,022 --> 00:33:12,894
Just rest.

630
00:33:19,781 --> 00:33:22,949
Change doesn't come
easy to you, Ben.

631
00:33:22,989 --> 00:33:24,356
I realize it.

632
00:33:24,393 --> 00:33:27,390
Believe me, I'm not expecting

633
00:33:27,434 --> 00:33:29,530
some sudden,
miraculous conversion.

634
00:33:29,606 --> 00:33:32,705
Change will come by itself,
if you're open to it.

635
00:33:32,747 --> 00:33:36,918
But you do have to show us
that you're open to it.

636
00:33:36,959 --> 00:33:40,867
A good start would be
to get rid of the uniform.

637
00:33:47,185 --> 00:33:50,557
I'll leave you these clothes.

638
00:33:50,594 --> 00:33:56,269
Once you've changed,
you can have this water.

639
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,072
Join us, Ben.

640
00:35:40,145 --> 00:35:41,637
Miles.

641
00:35:46,495 --> 00:35:47,964
What are you doing here?

642
00:35:49,368 --> 00:35:51,362
I need your help, Joseph.

643
00:35:51,408 --> 00:35:53,038
With what?

644
00:35:56,922 --> 00:36:00,055
There's nothing I can do,
so please, don't ask me.

645
00:36:00,097 --> 00:36:01,623
I've got to try to track down

646
00:36:01,667 --> 00:36:04,037
where that duonetic field
is coming from.

647
00:36:04,074 --> 00:36:07,846
We told you, there
are astatine deposits.

648
00:36:07,884 --> 00:36:09,353
That's not what's causing it.

649
00:36:09,387 --> 00:36:11,655
If it were, I'd have
that transmitter running

650
00:36:11,693 --> 00:36:13,527
and we'd all be out of here
already.

651
00:36:13,565 --> 00:36:15,091
It's got to be something else.

652
00:36:15,136 --> 00:36:18,133
And I think I figured a way
to get me to the source of it.

653
00:36:19,981 --> 00:36:23,514
And you want me to look the
other way while you leave.

654
00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:26,223
She'd put you in the box,
wouldn't she?

655
00:36:26,264 --> 00:36:30,070
Then do me a favor.

656
00:36:30,108 --> 00:36:33,914
Look down at that hematite
deposit I just discovered.

657
00:36:33,952 --> 00:36:35,923
Miles...

658
00:36:35,957 --> 00:36:38,521
I can do it
so it won't hurt at all.

659
00:37:01,288 --> 00:37:03,886
I owe you one, my friend.

660
00:39:09,188 --> 00:39:13,153
Well, you finally got one of us
out of our uniform.

661
00:39:13,198 --> 00:39:17,197
Come on, move it.

662
00:39:17,242 --> 00:39:18,643
Where's Alixus?

663
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:20,274
Get her out here.

664
00:39:29,507 --> 00:39:31,569
Get him some water!

665
00:39:42,909 --> 00:39:46,817
Do you know why this phaser
is working now?

666
00:39:46,852 --> 00:39:48,982
Because I shut down
the duonetic field

667
00:39:49,024 --> 00:39:50,961
that was stopping it
from working.

668
00:39:50,995 --> 00:39:53,867
An artificially created
duonetic field.

669
00:39:53,903 --> 00:39:57,777
Sisko to <i>Rio Grande.</i>

670
00:39:57,813 --> 00:40:01,518
Computer, respond.

671
00:40:01,652 --> 00:40:04,454
Your ship is no longer
in orbit, Ben.

672
00:40:04,492 --> 00:40:07,021
I destroyed it.

673
00:40:07,066 --> 00:40:12,741
I assume that means you control
the duonetic field.

674
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,079
I helped invent it.

675
00:40:14,117 --> 00:40:16,715
You'd be surprised
how many scientists

676
00:40:16,758 --> 00:40:19,755
are sympathetic
to my philosophies.

677
00:40:19,798 --> 00:40:21,267
Then it was no accident

678
00:40:21,303 --> 00:40:24,607
we developed life-support
problems near this planet.

679
00:40:24,678 --> 00:40:27,378
No, we were always
on our way here, Joseph.

680
00:40:27,419 --> 00:40:29,618
I chose it months in advance.

681
00:40:29,658 --> 00:40:32,426
It was far away
from any trade route

682
00:40:32,465 --> 00:40:34,527
completely isolated.

683
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:38,569
It was perfect for our...
ideal community.

684
00:40:38,615 --> 00:40:43,651
I hoped when we landed
we would never leave here.

685
00:40:43,761 --> 00:40:45,356
You lied to us.

686
00:40:45,398 --> 00:40:49,397
You've been lying to us
for ten years.

687
00:40:49,443 --> 00:40:54,046
Yes, but perhaps a lie can lead
to a more important truth.

688
00:40:54,088 --> 00:40:59,090
Would any of you have learned
who you really are at the core

689
00:40:59,134 --> 00:41:01,264
if you hadn't have come here?

690
00:41:01,307 --> 00:41:04,509
Joseph, you would
have been a repairman

691
00:41:04,548 --> 00:41:07,146
all of your life.

692
00:41:07,188 --> 00:41:10,094
Cassandra, you would have
been a technical clerk

693
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:13,002
in some closed-in room.

694
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:15,771
And, Stephan, my friend

695
00:41:15,811 --> 00:41:19,914
you probably would have
been in prison by now.

696
00:41:19,955 --> 00:41:22,519
Look at yourselves!

697
00:41:22,562 --> 00:41:26,368
Look at what you've become!

698
00:41:26,405 --> 00:41:35,293
What you've achieved here
has redefined your potential...

699
00:41:35,328 --> 00:41:38,826
the potential of man...

700
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:42,141
just as I knew it would.

701
00:41:42,179 --> 00:41:45,643
You are the living proof.

702
00:41:45,689 --> 00:41:47,751
What of the dead?

703
00:41:50,033 --> 00:41:52,699
What of Meg and the others?

704
00:41:56,216 --> 00:41:59,520
Only my son knows
how I have suffered

705
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:02,326
as I watched each of them die.

706
00:42:02,365 --> 00:42:05,669
You were willing to let them die
for your theories.

707
00:42:05,707 --> 00:42:09,148
You're going to have to answer
for what you've done.

708
00:42:09,182 --> 00:42:12,088
I'm prepared to go with you.

709
00:42:12,124 --> 00:42:14,962
Casualties were inevitable.

710
00:42:14,998 --> 00:42:18,667
I had to accept that
from the start.

711
00:42:18,707 --> 00:42:22,113
What if it were your son
who had been sick?

712
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:24,349
Would you let him die, too?

713
00:42:28,566 --> 00:42:31,699
Yes.

714
00:42:31,741 --> 00:42:36,378
For the sake of the community.

715
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,861
I did it all for the community.

716
00:42:43,037 --> 00:42:46,570
Kira to Sisko.
Are you all right, Commander?

717
00:42:46,613 --> 00:42:52,254
Everything is...
under control, Major.

718
00:42:52,294 --> 00:42:55,393
Stand by to begin
multiple transports.

719
00:42:55,436 --> 00:42:57,430
Acknowledged.

720
00:42:57,474 --> 00:42:59,946
We have room for all of you
on the runabout.

721
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,923
If you have anything
you want to bring with you

722
00:43:03,958 --> 00:43:05,154
you ought to get it now.

723
00:43:05,195 --> 00:43:08,067
Miles...

724
00:43:08,102 --> 00:43:12,205
this is our home.

725
00:43:12,246 --> 00:43:16,188
Whatever Alixus may be guilty of

726
00:43:16,223 --> 00:43:19,995
she did give us our community.

727
00:43:21,203 --> 00:43:23,265
I'm not sure if we'll
leave the device

728
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:26,715
on or off, now that
we know it's there.

729
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:28,778
And we'll have to decide

730
00:43:28,822 --> 00:43:33,529
if we want to establish contact
with the outside world.

731
00:43:33,568 --> 00:43:37,476
But Alixus is right.

732
00:43:37,512 --> 00:43:43,016
We have found something here

733
00:43:43,059 --> 00:43:45,931
that none of us is willing
to give up.

734
00:43:46,034 --> 00:43:50,067
It's time for those of us
who don't belong here

735
00:43:50,111 --> 00:43:52,207
to leave, Ben.

736
00:44:03,313 --> 00:44:05,808
Four to beam up, Major.

737
00:44:14,374 --> 00:44:16,642
Come, come.
