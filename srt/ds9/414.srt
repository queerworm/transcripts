1
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,600
Is all this really necessary?

2
00:00:06,643 --> 00:00:08,477
The Klingon invasion
has all but destroyed

3
00:00:08,514 --> 00:00:09,847
the Cardassian health system.

4
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:12,186
They're suffering outbreaks
of all kinds of diseases

5
00:00:12,257 --> 00:00:13,749
and in epidemic proportions.

6
00:00:13,794 --> 00:00:15,628
Besides, you've only got
12 more inoculations to go.

7
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:17,101
Twelve?

8
00:00:17,136 --> 00:00:19,608
Sorry, but if you want
to go to the conference...

9
00:00:19,642 --> 00:00:22,480
I don't want to go.
I'm no diplomat.

10
00:00:22,517 --> 00:00:26,357
Going to some obscure
Cardassian outpost

11
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:28,557
to share Bajoran intelligence
about the Klingons

12
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:30,695
isn't exactly
something I'm good at.

13
00:00:30,738 --> 00:00:33,871
I don't know why I even agreed
to go in the first place.

14
00:00:33,913 --> 00:00:36,112
You agreed to go because
it was a personal request

15
00:00:36,152 --> 00:00:38,522
from the First Minister
of Bajor.

16
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,054
Oh, it was a personal request,
all right.

17
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:45,270
Shakaar took me to my favorite
restaurant in Jalanda City

18
00:00:45,342 --> 00:00:48,110
poured me glass after glass
of spring wine

19
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,147
and then took me to his home
and gave me a massage

20
00:00:51,191 --> 00:00:53,025
with Kolaish spice oil.

21
00:00:53,063 --> 00:00:54,931
Well... nice to know
he's keeping in touch

22
00:00:54,968 --> 00:00:55,994
with his constituents.

23
00:00:56,037 --> 00:00:58,133
It wasn't fair.

24
00:00:58,176 --> 00:01:00,671
I mean, I would have said yes
to anything at that point.

25
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:04,254
Ah... Ah...

26
00:01:04,292 --> 00:01:05,761
What is it?

27
00:01:05,796 --> 00:01:07,095
I'm seeing spots.

28
00:01:07,132 --> 00:01:08,226
Big, green swirling ones?

29
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:09,465
The size of Alvinian melons.

30
00:01:09,505 --> 00:01:10,997
And is the room
beginning to spin?

31
00:01:11,042 --> 00:01:12,068
Yes.

32
00:01:12,112 --> 00:01:14,106
Good. It means the vaccine's
beginning to work.

33
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,418
Everything will settle down
in a moment.

34
00:01:16,457 --> 00:01:18,553
Major, may I speak with you?

35
00:01:18,596 --> 00:01:20,533
Uh, I'm not going anywhere.

36
00:01:20,568 --> 00:01:22,972
This one's going to make you
feel a little queasy.

37
00:01:23,007 --> 00:01:23,976
Ah.

38
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:25,912
If you have something
to say to the Major

39
00:01:25,948 --> 00:01:27,076
you better make it fast.

40
00:01:27,117 --> 00:01:29,419
The Federation has some concerns

41
00:01:29,457 --> 00:01:31,861
about your upcoming meeting
with the Cardassians.

42
00:01:31,897 --> 00:01:33,230
So do I.

43
00:01:33,267 --> 00:01:35,033
There are certain
technological advances

44
00:01:35,072 --> 00:01:37,442
that we have shared with
both Bajor and the Klingons

45
00:01:37,478 --> 00:01:40,680
that we'd prefer to keep
out of Cardassian hands.

46
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,814
Such as?

47
00:01:41,856 --> 00:01:44,556
Photon torpedo
guidance systems...

48
00:01:44,596 --> 00:01:46,260
long-range sensors...

49
00:01:46,301 --> 00:01:48,637
enhanced warp core overdrives.

50
00:01:48,674 --> 00:01:50,143
This is a complete list.

51
00:01:51,681 --> 00:01:53,345
Oh. Well...

52
00:01:53,386 --> 00:01:55,654
I think the Cardassians
are going to be

53
00:01:55,692 --> 00:01:57,025
a little disappointed.

54
00:01:57,062 --> 00:01:58,031
Undoubtedly.

55
00:01:58,065 --> 00:01:59,660
Is that all?

56
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:00,693
Yes.

57
00:02:00,738 --> 00:02:03,108
Oh, good.
I'll be right back.

58
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,745
I'm glad I'm not going
to Cardassia.

59
00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:16,537
Come in.

60
00:02:19,186 --> 00:02:20,678
Hello, Major.

61
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:21,852
Dukat...

62
00:02:21,893 --> 00:02:23,864
what are you doing here?

63
00:02:23,898 --> 00:02:26,929
I'm to escort you
to your meeting on Korma.

64
00:02:26,973 --> 00:02:28,841
You're commanding the <i>Groumall?</i>

65
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:29,847
Thanks to you.

66
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,349
If you had not convinced me

67
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:34,085
to bring my half-Bajoran
daughter back to Cardassia

68
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,993
I'd still be
Chief Military Advisor

69
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,397
to the Detapa Council.

70
00:02:37,433 --> 00:02:39,063
They demoted you.

71
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:43,913
Exactly one week
after my mother disowned me

72
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,892
and my wife took
our children and left.

73
00:02:50,968 --> 00:02:54,374
You still did
the right thing, Dukat.

74
00:02:54,411 --> 00:02:57,476
And as a reward
for following your advice

75
00:02:57,553 --> 00:03:00,994
I have been relegated
to ferrying freight.

76
00:03:01,964 --> 00:03:03,628
And, occasionally

77
00:03:03,668 --> 00:03:08,009
various foreign dignitaries,
such as yourself.

78
00:03:08,046 --> 00:03:11,452
Look, if it makes you
feel better to blame me

79
00:03:11,522 --> 00:03:13,152
go right ahead.

80
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,662
No, no, no.

81
00:03:14,697 --> 00:03:15,893
I blame no one...

82
00:03:15,933 --> 00:03:17,459
but myself.

83
00:03:17,538 --> 00:03:20,306
I was indiscreet.

84
00:03:20,345 --> 00:03:24,686
I compromised myself and have
been punished accordingly.

85
00:03:24,723 --> 00:03:28,187
If someone under my command
had behaved so outrageously

86
00:03:28,232 --> 00:03:30,932
I would do
the same thing to him.

87
00:03:30,972 --> 00:03:34,846
Besides, I assure you, this is
only a temporary setback.

88
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:40,123
Everything I have lost...
I will regain.

89
00:03:40,163 --> 00:03:42,533
It's only a matter of time.

90
00:03:42,603 --> 00:03:44,540
Now...

91
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,911
may I take your bags?

92
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,351
Please?

93
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:09,093
Come in.

94
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:11,596
Ziyal...

95
00:06:11,642 --> 00:06:14,616
I didn't know
you were on board.

96
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:16,381
Hello, Major.

97
00:06:16,421 --> 00:06:18,449
Oh, please, call me Nerys.

98
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:23,935
So, I take it
living on Cardassia

99
00:06:23,973 --> 00:06:26,377
didn't work out very well.

100
00:06:26,413 --> 00:06:30,116
I wasn't exactly welcomed
with open arms.

101
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,922
There were some Cardassians

102
00:06:31,961 --> 00:06:36,098
who could see past the Bajoran
ridges on my nose, but not many.

103
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:37,438
I'm sorry.

104
00:06:37,476 --> 00:06:39,914
I know it must have been
very difficult for you.

105
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:42,353
The only good thing
about living on Cardassia

106
00:06:42,388 --> 00:06:44,724
was being with my father.

107
00:06:44,761 --> 00:06:47,701
I'm glad the two of you
are getting along.

108
00:06:47,735 --> 00:06:49,170
He's been wonderful.

109
00:06:49,206 --> 00:06:50,675
And so brave.

110
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,340
He never tried to hide me away.

111
00:06:52,381 --> 00:06:54,545
He never acted
like he was ashamed of me.

112
00:06:54,586 --> 00:06:58,585
We'd go out to dinner together,
take long walks.

113
00:06:58,697 --> 00:07:00,827
And now that he's been exiled?

114
00:07:00,869 --> 00:07:02,669
Wherever he goes, I go.

115
00:07:02,707 --> 00:07:06,376
He's the only family I have.

116
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:09,323
And this is
the only home I need.

117
00:07:10,862 --> 00:07:13,836
Your father isn't the only one
who's brave.

118
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,532
What's that?

119
00:07:16,577 --> 00:07:18,548
It's a battle drill.

120
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:21,385
On a freighter?

121
00:07:21,423 --> 00:07:24,089
Target at 400,000 kilometers
and closing.

122
00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:26,829
Shields at maximum.
Maintain scan.

123
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:29,138
Engineering and tactical ready.

124
00:07:29,177 --> 00:07:30,943
Waiting on weapons, sir.

125
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:33,215
What's taking so long?

126
00:07:33,254 --> 00:07:35,350
The phaser banks
are still charging.

127
00:07:35,392 --> 00:07:38,628
I want those weapons
on line now.

128
00:07:38,735 --> 00:07:40,831
Phasers ready.

129
00:07:40,873 --> 00:07:42,001
Lock on target.

130
00:07:42,043 --> 00:07:43,444
Target set.

131
00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:45,440
Fire!

132
00:07:49,496 --> 00:07:50,829
Time.

133
00:07:50,866 --> 00:07:52,632
Three forty-seven.

134
00:07:52,671 --> 00:07:54,231
That's pitiful.

135
00:07:54,275 --> 00:07:57,944
A crew of Ferengi scrap peddlers
could do better than that.

136
00:07:57,985 --> 00:07:59,979
Select another target.

137
00:08:00,023 --> 00:08:01,014
We'll do it again.

138
00:08:01,059 --> 00:08:02,153
Aye, sir.

139
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,040
This may be a lowly freighter,
Major

140
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,416
but it's still a military vessel

141
00:08:11,453 --> 00:08:14,187
and will be run
in a military manner.

142
00:08:14,226 --> 00:08:16,630
You know...

143
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:19,104
you could speed up
your phaser recharge time

144
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:21,668
by routing power through
an anodyne capacitor.

145
00:08:21,747 --> 00:08:23,684
Thank you, Major.

146
00:08:23,752 --> 00:08:25,689
That's very helpful.

147
00:08:25,757 --> 00:08:29,699
And if we had an anodyne
capacitor, we would use it.

148
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,064
But we don't.

149
00:08:31,103 --> 00:08:33,837
Major...

150
00:08:33,878 --> 00:08:37,216
Please forgive me.

151
00:08:37,253 --> 00:08:40,193
I do appreciate your suggestion.

152
00:08:40,227 --> 00:08:46,905
Any anger I may have expressed
is due to my...

153
00:08:46,945 --> 00:08:52,894
frustration over the complete
inadequacy of this... vessel.

154
00:08:57,271 --> 00:09:00,336
I hope you'll allow me
to make it up to you.

155
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:02,350
What did you have in mind?

156
00:09:02,384 --> 00:09:05,517
I was hoping
we might have dinner together.

157
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,998
After all,
it is Cardassian tradition

158
00:09:08,032 --> 00:09:10,698
for the Commanding Officer
of a ship

159
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,574
to entertain his guests.

160
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:20,357
Far be it from me to stand
in the way of tradition.

161
00:09:28,018 --> 00:09:30,786
This is Bajoran spring wine.

162
00:09:30,892 --> 00:09:32,760
My last bottle.

163
00:09:32,797 --> 00:09:36,637
It's one of the things
I miss most about Bajor.

164
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,083
I talked to Ziyal.

165
00:09:41,118 --> 00:09:42,918
She's a lovely girl.

166
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:48,928
I'm very glad that you
convinced me not to kill her.

167
00:09:48,973 --> 00:09:51,001
Despite everything
that's happened?

168
00:09:51,044 --> 00:09:54,348
You may not believe this, Major

169
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:58,523
but when it comes to Ziyal
I regret nothing.

170
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:01,834
It's good to hear that.

171
00:10:01,872 --> 00:10:03,341
By the way, Major

172
00:10:03,377 --> 00:10:06,476
what it this I hear
about you and Shakaar?

173
00:10:06,518 --> 00:10:09,013
I don't know what you've heard.

174
00:10:09,058 --> 00:10:11,292
First, it was Vedek Bareil

175
00:10:11,331 --> 00:10:15,330
and now it's the head
of the Bajoran government.

176
00:10:15,374 --> 00:10:18,371
You do like powerful
men, don't you?

177
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:21,150
First of all,
Shakaar's an old friend.

178
00:10:21,189 --> 00:10:24,493
Second of all,
what business is it of yours?

179
00:10:24,532 --> 00:10:28,669
Let's just say it's further
incentive for me to regain my...

180
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:30,269
former position.

181
00:10:32,753 --> 00:10:35,955
It's good to see you haven't
lost your sense of humor.

182
00:10:36,028 --> 00:10:41,600
I must say I've always admired
Shakaar's success with women.

183
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:45,379
The intelligence file I kept
on him during the occupation

184
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:48,621
is filled with reports
of his conquests.

185
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,155
In fact, if you
remember correctly

186
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,333
you were the only female
in his resistance cell

187
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,904
that he didn't... charm.

188
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:59,318
At least until now.

189
00:10:59,355 --> 00:11:02,329
Is that what you kept track of
during the occupation?

190
00:11:02,363 --> 00:11:03,457
No wonder you lost.

191
00:11:06,507 --> 00:11:07,703
More wine, Major?

192
00:11:08,746 --> 00:11:10,546
Another drill?

193
00:11:10,584 --> 00:11:14,390
I didn't schedule one.

194
00:11:14,427 --> 00:11:17,299
Sir, we're approaching
the outpost on Korma...

195
00:11:17,335 --> 00:11:18,702
or what's left of it.

196
00:11:18,738 --> 00:11:20,207
What are you talking about?

197
00:11:20,243 --> 00:11:21,907
From what we can tell,
it's been attacked.

198
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:23,918
The planetary defense systems
have been disabled.

199
00:11:23,953 --> 00:11:25,354
Every building
has been destroyed.

200
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:26,358
How many casualties?

201
00:11:26,391 --> 00:11:27,860
There are no life-signs.

202
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:30,460
Then we have to assume
that everyone at the outpost

203
00:11:30,502 --> 00:11:33,772
including the Cardassian and the
Bajoran dignitaries, is dead.

204
00:11:33,811 --> 00:11:36,045
Sir, I'm reading
a subspace distortion

205
00:11:36,117 --> 00:11:38,316
bearing 001, mark 15.

206
00:11:38,357 --> 00:11:39,383
On screen.

207
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:50,611
Klingons...

208
00:11:56,537 --> 00:11:58,029
They're scanning us, sir.

209
00:11:58,074 --> 00:11:59,942
Full power to forward shields.

210
00:11:59,979 --> 00:12:02,508
At this distance,
your shields won't mean much.

211
00:12:02,552 --> 00:12:05,822
Sir, they've stopped
scanning us.

212
00:12:05,861 --> 00:12:07,923
What are they doing?

213
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:10,732
Nothing, sir.

214
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:13,245
They don't seem to be in a hurry
to do anything about us.

215
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,251
They don't think
we're a threat, Dukat.

216
00:12:15,286 --> 00:12:17,554
Then why were they cloaked
when we arrived?

217
00:12:17,591 --> 00:12:19,357
They detected
an incoming vessel.

218
00:12:19,396 --> 00:12:21,732
They didn't know what it was,
so they hid.

219
00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:23,831
Now they know
and they're unconcerned.

220
00:12:23,874 --> 00:12:26,540
The Klingon ship
has lowered its shields.

221
00:12:26,582 --> 00:12:29,214
They're moving off
at one-quarter impulse.

222
00:12:29,255 --> 00:12:32,023
They'll pay for their arrogance.

223
00:12:32,062 --> 00:12:33,531
Charge phaser banks.

224
00:12:33,566 --> 00:12:35,126
What are you doing, Dukat?

225
00:12:35,237 --> 00:12:37,505
You can't go up against
a bird-of-prey.

226
00:12:37,543 --> 00:12:41,144
Must I remind you, Major,
they just murdered your people

227
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:42,152
as well as mine?

228
00:12:42,256 --> 00:12:43,623
I know that

229
00:12:43,659 --> 00:12:46,565
but getting all of us killed
isn't going to change that.

230
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,072
We're the only Cardassian ship
in the area.

231
00:12:49,107 --> 00:12:52,605
I'm not going to let these
Klingons escape unchallenged.

232
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:54,951
You attack them,
and all you're going to do

233
00:12:54,988 --> 00:12:56,514
is give them
a little target practice.

234
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,995
They're going
to blow us to pieces

235
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,192
with their first shot.

236
00:12:59,266 --> 00:13:00,394
Phaser banks charged.

237
00:13:00,436 --> 00:13:02,270
Lock phasers on target.

238
00:13:02,308 --> 00:13:03,277
Phasers locked.

239
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,802
Dukat!

240
00:13:04,848 --> 00:13:07,150
At least lock on
to the underside of their hull.

241
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:08,884
It's their weakest spot.

242
00:13:08,924 --> 00:13:09,742
You heard the Major.

243
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:11,779
Target set.

244
00:13:11,815 --> 00:13:13,649
Fire.

245
00:13:16,994 --> 00:13:18,965
Their shields were down

246
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:21,095
and we didn't penetrate
their hull.

247
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,209
Divert all power
to forward shields.

248
00:13:24,247 --> 00:13:25,238
Aye, sir.

249
00:13:37,715 --> 00:13:39,116
They've gone to warp.

250
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:42,955
Well...

251
00:13:45,636 --> 00:13:50,547
it would seem we're not...
worth destroying.

252
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:53,144
Lucky for us.

253
00:13:57,265 --> 00:14:01,902
I suppose
from their point of view...

254
00:14:01,945 --> 00:14:07,290
there's no honor in destroying
a worthless freighter.

255
00:14:10,968 --> 00:14:14,637
I have to inform
Central Command.

256
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:18,552
These Klingons
have been operating

257
00:14:18,655 --> 00:14:22,119
behind our lines with impunity.

258
00:14:22,163 --> 00:14:24,499
Someone has got to stop them.

259
00:14:28,013 --> 00:14:30,577
Someone else.

260
00:14:30,686 --> 00:14:33,819
How close is the nearest
Cardassian warship?

261
00:14:37,036 --> 00:14:39,600
Probably in the Dopa system
somewhere.

262
00:14:39,642 --> 00:14:41,704
That's almost three days away.

263
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:44,277
By the time they get here,
the Klingons will be long gone.

264
00:14:44,321 --> 00:14:47,420
That's true, but what
can we do about it?

265
00:14:47,463 --> 00:14:50,733
We can go after the Klingons.

266
00:14:54,347 --> 00:14:58,848
A moment ago, you
were advising caution.

267
00:14:58,892 --> 00:15:00,327
That's because a moment ago

268
00:15:00,362 --> 00:15:02,766
we were in no position
to fight back.

269
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:03,771
I have no intention

270
00:15:03,805 --> 00:15:05,605
of letting them get away
with what they did.

271
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,544
Now, you said scanners showed

272
00:15:07,582 --> 00:15:10,054
that the outpost
disruptors were disabled

273
00:15:10,088 --> 00:15:11,250
not destroyed, right?

274
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:12,453
Correct.

275
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,967
Dukat, do you think
you'd be able to repair

276
00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:16,402
one of those disruptors?

277
00:15:16,438 --> 00:15:17,498
What would be the point?

278
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,979
I doubt we can lure the Klingons
back to the outpost.

279
00:15:20,014 --> 00:15:22,486
Maybe not, but there's no reason

280
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,993
we can't make a few
alterations to your ship.

281
00:15:25,027 --> 00:15:29,802
What kind of alterations?

282
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,138
Here?

283
00:15:31,177 --> 00:15:33,080
In the cargo hold?

284
00:15:33,115 --> 00:15:34,448
Why not?

285
00:15:34,485 --> 00:15:39,088
Well, because the outpost's
planetary defense weapons

286
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,896
are system 5 disruptors.

287
00:15:40,935 --> 00:15:42,599
They were never designed

288
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,043
to operate aboard
a moving spacecraft.

289
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:46,446
And these cargo bays

290
00:15:46,482 --> 00:15:48,612
were never designed
to hold them.

291
00:15:48,654 --> 00:15:51,422
Dukat, you are going
to have to stop thinking

292
00:15:51,462 --> 00:15:54,060
like a Cardassian
military officer.

293
00:15:54,102 --> 00:15:55,093
And more like you?

294
00:15:55,138 --> 00:15:56,698
More like a resistance fighter.

295
00:15:56,742 --> 00:15:59,146
You have got to make
use of what you have.

296
00:15:59,182 --> 00:16:01,176
If you need a hammer
and you don't have one

297
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,246
use a pipe.

298
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,418
And you really think

299
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:06,593
we can make those weapons
operational on this ship?

300
00:16:06,635 --> 00:16:09,107
It's worth a try.

301
00:16:09,141 --> 00:16:13,608
I suppose if we disable
the tractor beam

302
00:16:13,653 --> 00:16:15,852
we could reroute enough power

303
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:18,490
to operate
one of the disruptors.

304
00:16:18,532 --> 00:16:21,734
But those weapons are huge.

305
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,275
What do we do
with all this cargo?

306
00:16:23,312 --> 00:16:24,303
Get rid of it.

307
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:27,654
All of it?

308
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:30,424
I realize it's traditional
for a Cardassian Captain

309
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,229
to take a percentage
of the haul

310
00:16:32,268 --> 00:16:35,140
but you are going to have
to shed a lot of traditions

311
00:16:35,176 --> 00:16:37,671
if you are serious about
fighting the Klingons.

312
00:16:37,716 --> 00:16:41,453
Some traditions
are hard to break.

313
00:16:41,492 --> 00:16:44,694
You'll get used to it.

314
00:16:52,253 --> 00:16:57,894
You... never cease
to impress me, Major.

315
00:16:59,539 --> 00:17:02,034
I have a lot
to learn from you.

316
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,336
Target at 500,000 kilometers.

317
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:14,970
System 5 disruptor
on line.

318
00:17:15,012 --> 00:17:16,311
Open cargo bay doors.

319
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:17,613
Doors opening.

320
00:17:17,653 --> 00:17:20,217
Telemetry lock confirmed.

321
00:17:20,259 --> 00:17:21,626
Are you ready?

322
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:25,161
Diverting all power
to your station.

323
00:17:25,206 --> 00:17:27,974
200,000 kilometers and closing.

324
00:17:28,012 --> 00:17:30,040
Fire!

325
00:17:35,967 --> 00:17:37,300
Very impressive, Major!

326
00:17:37,337 --> 00:17:39,103
Don't be too
impressed yet, Dukat.

327
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,701
We still have some problems.

328
00:17:40,745 --> 00:17:43,183
Firing the disruptor
ruptured power relays

329
00:17:43,218 --> 00:17:45,417
and plasma circuits
all over the ship.

330
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:48,455
We have small plasma leaks
in Levels 2, 4 and 5.

331
00:17:48,499 --> 00:17:50,025
I want those leaks
fixed immediately.

332
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,038
Aye, sir.

333
00:17:51,072 --> 00:17:52,804
We're going to have
to do something

334
00:17:52,844 --> 00:17:54,177
about that recoil.

335
00:17:54,214 --> 00:17:57,245
Major, I'm confident
you'll have that disruptor

336
00:17:57,289 --> 00:17:58,622
running so smoothly

337
00:17:58,659 --> 00:18:00,789
it wouldn't wake
a sleeping child.

338
00:18:02,168 --> 00:18:05,769
Why is it, when you smile,
I want to leave the room?

339
00:18:05,811 --> 00:18:09,183
I suppose it's because
of my overwhelming charm.

340
00:18:09,219 --> 00:18:12,091
But you must admit
it is rather amusing.

341
00:18:12,127 --> 00:18:15,158
When we do destroy
that bird-of-prey

342
00:18:15,202 --> 00:18:20,443
it will no doubt go a long way
toward restoring my reputation...

343
00:18:20,482 --> 00:18:23,114
and I have you
to thank for it.

344
00:18:23,155 --> 00:18:26,357
I'm trying not to think
about that.

345
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:28,129
Major...

346
00:18:28,168 --> 00:18:31,803
why are you so reluctant
to face the obvious?

347
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:33,543
We make an excellent team.

348
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,213
We are not a team, Dukat

349
00:18:35,254 --> 00:18:37,384
and we have nothing in common.

350
00:18:37,426 --> 00:18:38,622
The only reason I'm helping you

351
00:18:38,663 --> 00:18:41,660
is because those Klingons
killed 15 Bajoran diplomats.

352
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:44,268
There were Cardassians
at that outpost, too.

353
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,370
Maybe.

354
00:18:45,414 --> 00:18:47,351
But all you care about
is redeeming yourself

355
00:18:47,385 --> 00:18:48,752
in the eyes of the
Cardassian government.

356
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:50,988
You have seen an opportunity
for advancement

357
00:18:51,028 --> 00:18:52,361
and you are grabbing it.

358
00:18:53,601 --> 00:18:57,236
You judge me too harshly.

359
00:18:57,278 --> 00:19:01,015
Maybe I am seeking to regain
my former position...

360
00:19:01,054 --> 00:19:05,361
one which I earned
through hard work

361
00:19:05,399 --> 00:19:07,461
dedication, and sacrifice.

362
00:19:09,209 --> 00:19:12,513
But redemption is not
my sole motivation.

363
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,422
I care about my people

364
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,660
and I don't intend
to allow the Klingons

365
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,403
to get away
with murdering them.

366
00:19:25,718 --> 00:19:28,988
I'm a much more complicated man
than you give me credit for.

367
00:19:29,026 --> 00:19:30,690
Well, if that's true

368
00:19:30,731 --> 00:19:33,329
I suppose I prefer simpler men.

369
00:19:33,371 --> 00:19:35,843
Like Shakaar?

370
00:19:35,877 --> 00:19:37,541
It amazes me that a woman

371
00:19:37,582 --> 00:19:41,456
as intelligent
and sophisticated as you

372
00:19:41,492 --> 00:19:42,586
could be attracted

373
00:19:42,628 --> 00:19:45,260
to such a lumbering,
simplistic field hand.

374
00:19:45,302 --> 00:19:47,797
I mean, what could
the two of you

375
00:19:47,843 --> 00:19:49,438
possibly talk about?

376
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:53,216
That lumbering field hand
is the First Minister of Bajor

377
00:19:53,256 --> 00:19:55,660
and he knows more
about how to talk to me

378
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:56,858
than you ever will.

379
00:19:56,899 --> 00:19:59,098
How can you be so sure?

380
00:19:59,172 --> 00:20:01,406
After all, you don't
know me well enough

381
00:20:01,444 --> 00:20:02,462
to make a comparison.

382
00:20:02,595 --> 00:20:04,327
I don't want
to know you well enough.

383
00:20:04,367 --> 00:20:07,169
And if you want
to keep working with me

384
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:10,340
I suggest you stick to business.

385
00:20:12,053 --> 00:20:13,613
I'm sorry, Major.

386
00:20:13,658 --> 00:20:15,822
I didn't mean any harm.

387
00:20:15,863 --> 00:20:18,803
I was only making conversation.

388
00:20:23,249 --> 00:20:25,915
Damar, set another target.

389
00:20:25,956 --> 00:20:29,796
We'll test our new weapon
as soon as the Major's ready.

390
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:32,932
Let's see if we can't
work out our problems

391
00:20:32,975 --> 00:20:35,243
at least the ones we're
having with the disruptor.

392
00:20:38,521 --> 00:20:40,321
This is a standard issue

393
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,798
Cardassian
phase-disruptor rifle.

394
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,567
It has a 4.7 megajoule
power capacity

395
00:20:45,607 --> 00:20:48,979
three-millisecond recharge,
two beam settings.

396
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:52,751
How do you know so much
about Cardassian weapons?

397
00:20:52,792 --> 00:20:55,458
We captured a lot of them
during the occupation.

398
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,471
It's a good weapon...
solid, simple.

399
00:20:57,505 --> 00:21:01,106
You can drag it through the mud
and it'll still fire.

400
00:21:01,148 --> 00:21:04,452
Now, this... this is
an entirely different animal.

401
00:21:04,489 --> 00:21:06,551
Federation standard issue.

402
00:21:06,594 --> 00:21:08,497
It's a little less powerful

403
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,767
but it's got
a lot more options.

404
00:21:10,806 --> 00:21:12,105
16 beam settings.

405
00:21:12,142 --> 00:21:15,743
Fully autonomous...
recharge...

406
00:21:15,785 --> 00:21:17,756
multiple target acquisition...

407
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:20,524
gyro stabilized, the works.

408
00:21:20,565 --> 00:21:23,471
It's, um, a little
more complicated

409
00:21:23,505 --> 00:21:25,739
so it's not
as good a field weapon.

410
00:21:25,778 --> 00:21:27,476
Too many things
can go wrong with it.

411
00:21:27,516 --> 00:21:30,854
I can see why my father
likes having you around.

412
00:21:30,891 --> 00:21:34,195
I think, um...

413
00:21:34,233 --> 00:21:36,603
you should stick
with the Cardassian rifle.

414
00:21:36,639 --> 00:21:40,445
It's smaller, easier to use,
and if we get boarded

415
00:21:40,482 --> 00:21:42,042
I don't want you
to have to think too much

416
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,248
about the weapon you're using.

417
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:46,594
You don't like my father
very much, do you?

418
00:21:46,632 --> 00:21:48,398
No.

419
00:21:48,436 --> 00:21:49,496
I don't.

420
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:52,975
I understand.

421
00:21:53,015 --> 00:21:56,513
He did some very bad things
during the occupation.

422
00:21:59,967 --> 00:22:02,269
Yes, he did.

423
00:22:02,306 --> 00:22:03,775
It bothers him, you know.

424
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:04,779
Does it?

425
00:22:04,812 --> 00:22:05,803
Very much.

426
00:22:05,849 --> 00:22:07,615
He talks about it sometimes.

427
00:22:07,653 --> 00:22:09,852
He'd never admit it
to anyone else

428
00:22:09,892 --> 00:22:12,660
but he thinks
the occupation was a mistake.

429
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,728
Somehow I don't think
he'd say that

430
00:22:14,771 --> 00:22:16,401
if the Cardassians had won.

431
00:22:16,443 --> 00:22:17,571
Maybe not.

432
00:22:17,613 --> 00:22:19,812
But maybe losing made
him a better person.

433
00:22:19,851 --> 00:22:21,754
Well, then a lot
of innocent people died

434
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:24,591
for his education.

435
00:22:24,631 --> 00:22:26,602
I... I know.

436
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:27,798
I think about that a lot.

437
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:29,103
But when I look at my father

438
00:22:29,209 --> 00:22:30,941
I have a hard time
seeing a murderer.

439
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,279
And when I look at him

440
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:34,551
I have a hard time
seeing anything else.

441
00:22:38,968 --> 00:22:40,437
You're his daughter.

442
00:22:40,471 --> 00:22:42,807
My father says
that the two of you

443
00:22:42,844 --> 00:22:44,313
have a lot in common.

444
00:22:44,348 --> 00:22:47,116
That you both did things
during the war that you regret.

445
00:22:47,156 --> 00:22:49,958
That's why he cares so much
about what you think of him.

446
00:22:49,996 --> 00:22:53,699
Ziyal, what your father
wants from me

447
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:55,607
is forgiveness.

448
00:22:55,645 --> 00:22:59,086
That's one thing
I can never give him.

449
00:23:01,493 --> 00:23:03,123
Now...

450
00:23:03,164 --> 00:23:04,633
I think we should concentrate

451
00:23:04,668 --> 00:23:07,004
on getting you comfortable
with this weapon.

452
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:16,757
What about the Cardassian base
on the fourth moon of Rakal?

453
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,465
Mmm. It's subterranean.

454
00:23:19,507 --> 00:23:21,444
It's much too fortified
to be a viable target

455
00:23:21,478 --> 00:23:22,970
for a bird-of-prey.

456
00:23:23,015 --> 00:23:25,385
It would take
a Vor'cha-class cruiser

457
00:23:25,422 --> 00:23:26,982
to do any real damage.

458
00:23:27,026 --> 00:23:32,165
How about the station
on Amleth Prime?

459
00:23:32,206 --> 00:23:35,978
No, the Amleth system's located
inside an emission nebula.

460
00:23:36,016 --> 00:23:39,354
The Klingon cloaking device
would be useless.

461
00:23:39,391 --> 00:23:42,695
I know where they'll go next...

462
00:23:42,733 --> 00:23:44,100
Loval.

463
00:23:44,137 --> 00:23:47,407
That's on the other side
of the sector.

464
00:23:47,445 --> 00:23:50,442
A long way
from the Cardassian fleet.

465
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:57,404
From what it says here

466
00:23:57,438 --> 00:23:59,466
Loval is mainly
a civilian outpost

467
00:23:59,511 --> 00:24:01,505
with a small
subspace relay station.

468
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:04,682
The Klingons have been going
after a lot bigger prizes.

469
00:24:04,724 --> 00:24:07,664
What it says there
is not exactly true.

470
00:24:07,698 --> 00:24:11,036
Loval is also
a weapons research installation,

471
00:24:11,073 --> 00:24:14,810
which is supposed to be
a closely guarded secret.

472
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:19,226
Now, considering the targets
the Klingons have hit so far

473
00:24:19,261 --> 00:24:23,568
I think we've underestimated
their intelligence network.

474
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:28,415
Sounds like a choice target.

475
00:24:28,452 --> 00:24:30,686
Loval it is.

476
00:24:33,498 --> 00:24:35,800
The question is...

477
00:24:35,838 --> 00:24:39,210
even if we're right,
can we stop them?

478
00:24:39,247 --> 00:24:43,850
All we need is one good shot
with the new disruptor.

479
00:24:43,891 --> 00:24:47,833
Which won't be easy to get,
considering they'll be cloaked.

480
00:24:47,869 --> 00:24:49,601
We don't have to find them.

481
00:24:49,641 --> 00:24:51,737
We have to make them come to us.

482
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:54,251
Lure them in.

483
00:24:54,286 --> 00:24:57,351
Make them think that we're
a helpless freighter.

484
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,895
We have to make them

485
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:02,531
think... that we have
valuable cargo aboard.

486
00:25:04,011 --> 00:25:07,817
How does refined
dilithium crystal sound?

487
00:25:07,854 --> 00:25:13,129
I can get Damar to modify
the subspace transceiver array

488
00:25:13,168 --> 00:25:16,336
to emit a false
dilithium signal.

489
00:25:16,409 --> 00:25:18,437
Now, if I know the Klingons

490
00:25:18,482 --> 00:25:20,681
they'll lock
their tractor beam on us

491
00:25:20,721 --> 00:25:22,351
and try to take our cargo.

492
00:25:22,392 --> 00:25:24,591
And we'll have a little surprise
waiting for them.

493
00:25:24,631 --> 00:25:25,725
Yes.

494
00:25:25,767 --> 00:25:27,704
Not bad.

495
00:25:27,739 --> 00:25:31,009
I told you
we make a good team, Major.

496
00:25:31,048 --> 00:25:35,583
You are as insightful a woman
as you are intriguing.

497
00:25:37,598 --> 00:25:39,398
I thought we agreed

498
00:25:39,503 --> 00:25:41,406
to keep this
strictly business.

499
00:25:41,508 --> 00:25:43,240
Major, is it my imagination

500
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,412
or do you have a hard time
accepting compliments?

501
00:25:46,521 --> 00:25:50,258
I have a hard time accepting
compliments from you.

502
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:53,329
Well, I'll try
to restrain my enthusiasm

503
00:25:53,372 --> 00:25:56,038
but I can't make you
any promises.

504
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:59,851
We better get to Loval
before the Klingons do.

505
00:26:01,594 --> 00:26:02,563
Damar.

506
00:26:02,596 --> 00:26:03,895
Sir?

507
00:26:03,933 --> 00:26:06,132
Set a course for Loval.

508
00:26:06,172 --> 00:26:08,576
Maximum warp.

509
00:26:08,612 --> 00:26:10,242
Aye, sir.

510
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,932
Loval system
within scanning range, sir.

511
00:26:16,967 --> 00:26:18,961
Any sign of them?

512
00:26:20,008 --> 00:26:21,568
No, sir.

513
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:22,843
If they're not there now

514
00:26:22,883 --> 00:26:24,409
they'll be there soon enough.

515
00:26:24,453 --> 00:26:29,798
Begin modifications to the
subspace transceiver array.

516
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:43,134
We soldiers spend
a lot of time waiting

517
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:44,501
don't we, Major?

518
00:26:44,538 --> 00:26:48,002
It's not easy to keep
your mind from drifting.

519
00:26:48,048 --> 00:26:51,683
I don't usually have any
trouble concentrating

520
00:26:51,724 --> 00:26:53,786
unless I'm being distracted.

521
00:26:53,829 --> 00:26:56,529
Lately, when my mind wanders

522
00:26:56,603 --> 00:27:01,378
I find myself thinking
more and more about...

523
00:27:01,415 --> 00:27:04,480
Gul Marratt.

524
00:27:04,523 --> 00:27:05,316
Do you know him?

525
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:07,580
Very dashing.

526
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:13,229
One of Cardassia's
rising stars...

527
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:18,443
graduate of the Cardassian
Military Academy...

528
00:27:18,483 --> 00:27:23,554
smooth-talking junior member
of the Detapa Council...

529
00:27:23,597 --> 00:27:27,130
and like your friend Shakaar...

530
00:27:27,173 --> 00:27:29,144
quite a ladies' man.

531
00:27:29,178 --> 00:27:33,245
Especially
with other officers' wives.

532
00:27:33,289 --> 00:27:34,588
Including yours?

533
00:27:34,625 --> 00:27:36,220
Mmm.

534
00:27:36,263 --> 00:27:41,299
A year ago, he wouldn't
have dared, but now...

535
00:27:42,713 --> 00:27:46,051
I think the first thing I do
when I'm restored to power

536
00:27:46,088 --> 00:27:48,184
will be to demote him.

537
00:27:48,228 --> 00:27:52,969
Assign him to the Cardassian
Embassy on Breen.

538
00:27:54,979 --> 00:27:59,480
I hear it's bitter cold
on Breen.

539
00:27:59,524 --> 00:28:03,934
And we Cardassians
do despise the cold.

540
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,937
Sir.

541
00:28:04,971 --> 00:28:05,802
I've got something.

542
00:28:07,277 --> 00:28:09,407
On screen.

543
00:28:13,459 --> 00:28:16,433
Well, Major...

544
00:28:16,467 --> 00:28:22,039
it seems fate has smiled
on our little plan.

545
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:35,282
They're scanning us.

546
00:28:35,316 --> 00:28:37,116
Good.

547
00:28:37,154 --> 00:28:39,820
Let's hope they take the bait.

548
00:28:41,332 --> 00:28:44,306
Sir, they've locked
their disruptors on us.

549
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,869
They haven't fired.

550
00:28:46,913 --> 00:28:50,411
Which means they could be
interested in our cargo.

551
00:28:50,455 --> 00:28:52,358
They're hailing us, sir.

552
00:28:52,394 --> 00:28:53,829
Demanding our surrender.

553
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:55,357
They're interested.

554
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:57,100
Now let's see if you
can make them bite.

555
00:28:59,145 --> 00:29:00,809
On screen.

556
00:29:02,219 --> 00:29:04,281
Identify yourself.

557
00:29:04,324 --> 00:29:06,022
I'm Gul Dukat

558
00:29:06,063 --> 00:29:08,969
Commander of the Cardassian
Freighter <i>Groumall.</i>

559
00:29:09,004 --> 00:29:10,337
Who are you?

560
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:13,576
What is your cargo
and destination?

561
00:29:13,615 --> 00:29:16,521
We are carrying replicator
and transporter parts

562
00:29:16,557 --> 00:29:18,323
to the Dopa system.

563
00:29:18,361 --> 00:29:19,728
You're lying!

564
00:29:19,765 --> 00:29:21,861
I assure you, Captain...

565
00:29:21,904 --> 00:29:24,536
I'm confiscating your ship
and its cargo.

566
00:29:24,578 --> 00:29:26,708
On whose authority?

567
00:29:28,488 --> 00:29:31,986
On the authority
of the Klingon Empire

568
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:36,531
and the disruptors
I have pointed at your vessel.

569
00:29:38,982 --> 00:29:40,542
Convincing, wasn't I?

570
00:29:40,585 --> 00:29:41,781
I'll let you know.

571
00:29:43,527 --> 00:29:45,361
They've locked
their tractor beam on us.

572
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:49,938
Wait for my signal.

573
00:29:51,614 --> 00:29:53,950
Wait...

574
00:29:53,987 --> 00:29:57,257
Open the cargo bay doors.

575
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:58,629
Doors opening.

576
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,371
Fire.

577
00:30:07,422 --> 00:30:08,823
We've breached their hull.

578
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,592
Their impulse engines are down.

579
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:11,599
They're adrift.

580
00:30:11,633 --> 00:30:13,263
Excellent.

581
00:30:15,643 --> 00:30:18,047
They're re-locking
their disruptors on us.

582
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:20,989
All power
to forward shields.

583
00:30:29,212 --> 00:30:31,446
Damage?

584
00:30:31,485 --> 00:30:33,923
Both shields are down
to 20 percent!

585
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:36,088
We can't sustain another hit!

586
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:38,432
I think it's time to improvise!

587
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:43,014
I want all power
to the disruptors, now!

588
00:30:43,048 --> 00:30:45,282
You, get down
to the weapons room

589
00:30:45,321 --> 00:30:48,159
and find out
what's taking them so long.

590
00:31:08,714 --> 00:31:09,443
Major!

591
00:31:09,483 --> 00:31:11,751
Just give me a minute.

592
00:31:13,995 --> 00:31:15,727
Hurry, Major.

593
00:31:15,766 --> 00:31:18,102
Quiet.
I need to concentrate.

594
00:31:18,139 --> 00:31:20,441
Lock target.

595
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:22,415
Prepare to fire.

596
00:31:35,149 --> 00:31:39,091
You are a magician, Major.

597
00:31:39,127 --> 00:31:41,326
There's nothing magical
about it.

598
00:31:41,365 --> 00:31:44,362
Not when you know
Klingon transporter codes.

599
00:31:48,183 --> 00:31:49,743
It worked.

600
00:31:49,788 --> 00:31:51,383
All our people are here

601
00:31:51,458 --> 00:31:54,124
and all 36 Klingons
are on the freighter.

602
00:31:54,166 --> 00:31:56,730
Oh, I can just imagine
that Klingon Captain

603
00:31:56,772 --> 00:31:58,971
explaining this
to his superiors.

604
00:31:59,012 --> 00:32:01,314
He won't get the opportunity.

605
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:11,644
Was that necessary?

606
00:32:11,678 --> 00:32:13,740
You're the terrorist.

607
00:32:13,783 --> 00:32:16,381
You tell me.

608
00:32:16,456 --> 00:32:17,857
Weapons secured, sir.

609
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,056
Excellent.

610
00:32:19,097 --> 00:32:20,566
So is Engineering.

611
00:32:21,604 --> 00:32:23,302
Well done.

612
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:28,418
Well, Major...

613
00:32:28,522 --> 00:32:31,188
quite a prize we've taken.

614
00:32:31,229 --> 00:32:34,362
The first Klingon bird-of-prey

615
00:32:34,403 --> 00:32:37,901
ever to be captured
by Cardassia.

616
00:32:37,946 --> 00:32:39,814
I think I just found
a bigger prize.

617
00:32:39,851 --> 00:32:42,119
It looks like we've got
the target priorities

618
00:32:42,156 --> 00:32:45,689
of all Klingon raiders
in Cardassian space.

619
00:32:45,733 --> 00:32:48,137
Ha!

620
00:32:48,172 --> 00:32:53,482
I'll contact Central Command
and inform them of our success.

621
00:32:53,553 --> 00:32:58,624
I think I'll request
my Legate title be reinstated

622
00:32:58,667 --> 00:33:01,037
effective immediately.

623
00:33:01,073 --> 00:33:02,873
Get me Central Command.

624
00:33:02,911 --> 00:33:05,041
No, on second thought...

625
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,179
this is too important for them.

626
00:33:07,221 --> 00:33:11,892
I want to speak to the Chairman
of the Detapa Council himself

627
00:33:11,934 --> 00:33:13,564
on a secure channel.

628
00:33:13,605 --> 00:33:14,938
I can't do that from here, sir.

629
00:33:14,975 --> 00:33:17,139
The communication terminals
on the Bridge are down.

630
00:33:17,181 --> 00:33:19,277
But I could reroute it
to the Captain's quarters.

631
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,419
Good. Do so.
Then make the repairs.

632
00:33:22,462 --> 00:33:25,264
I want this ship
fully operational

633
00:33:25,302 --> 00:33:26,498
as soon as possible.

634
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:27,529
Aye, sir.

635
00:33:34,693 --> 00:33:37,131
Ziyal, do you see
the phase compensator

636
00:33:37,166 --> 00:33:39,137
in the backup plasma manifold?

637
00:33:39,172 --> 00:33:40,641
What's it look like?

638
00:33:40,675 --> 00:33:42,475
Perhaps I should go help her.

639
00:33:42,514 --> 00:33:44,212
Klingon technology is...

640
00:33:44,252 --> 00:33:46,155
Odd. Good idea.

641
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,218
Hang on, Ziyal.
Help's on the way.

642
00:33:48,262 --> 00:33:49,595
Understood.

643
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:52,936
You know something, Dukat.

644
00:33:52,974 --> 00:33:54,273
These computer logs

645
00:33:54,311 --> 00:33:56,248
are even more valuable
than I thought.

646
00:33:56,283 --> 00:33:57,718
They contain status reports

647
00:33:57,753 --> 00:34:01,456
from Klingon ships and outposts
throughout Cardassian space.

648
00:34:01,496 --> 00:34:05,131
With information like this,
Cardassia could launch a major

649
00:34:05,172 --> 00:34:06,972
counterattack
against the Klingons.

650
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:08,479
They could

651
00:34:08,514 --> 00:34:11,316
but they won't.

652
00:34:11,355 --> 00:34:13,485
Why not?

653
00:34:13,527 --> 00:34:17,560
The Detapa Council
has something else in mind.

654
00:34:17,605 --> 00:34:21,011
They've ordered me not
to engage the Klingons

655
00:34:21,046 --> 00:34:23,518
in any further conflict.

656
00:34:23,553 --> 00:34:27,100
The Council is looking
for a diplomatic solution.

657
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:29,933
They've ordered me
to return to Cardassia Prime

658
00:34:29,974 --> 00:34:34,179
to resume my...
post as Military Advisor.

659
00:34:34,218 --> 00:34:36,588
Well, I thought
that's what you wanted.

660
00:34:36,624 --> 00:34:38,322
It was.

661
00:34:38,362 --> 00:34:41,164
But what is the point
of being a military advisor

662
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,175
to a government
that won't fight?

663
00:34:43,209 --> 00:34:45,237
Well, you can change
their minds.

664
00:34:45,347 --> 00:34:49,586
Convince your fellow Cardassians
to go on the offensive.

665
00:34:49,625 --> 00:34:51,789
Nah, I'd be wasting my breath.

666
00:34:51,831 --> 00:34:54,133
They wouldn't listen to me.

667
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:56,642
No one wants to fight.

668
00:34:59,351 --> 00:35:01,185
There was a time

669
00:35:01,222 --> 00:35:06,327
when the mere mention
of my race inspired fear.

670
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:09,343
And now...
we're a beaten people.

671
00:35:09,377 --> 00:35:12,841
Afraid to fight back
because we don't want to lose

672
00:35:12,885 --> 00:35:14,788
what little is left.

673
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:17,193
That's not the Cardassians
I know.

674
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,030
What Cardassians?

675
00:35:19,068 --> 00:35:21,700
Don't you see, Major?

676
00:35:21,741 --> 00:35:23,712
They're paralyzed.

677
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:26,379
They're beaten and defeated.

678
00:35:26,421 --> 00:35:29,623
I am the only Cardassian left

679
00:35:29,662 --> 00:35:34,403
and if no one else will stand
against the Klingons...

680
00:35:34,442 --> 00:35:36,470
I will.

681
00:35:43,531 --> 00:35:45,297
Look, Dukat,
I know you're angry

682
00:35:45,336 --> 00:35:47,570
but maybe you ought to think
about what you're proposing.

683
00:35:47,609 --> 00:35:50,583
I mean, you can't go to war
against the whole Klingon Empire

684
00:35:50,616 --> 00:35:51,846
with one bird-of-prey.

685
00:35:51,887 --> 00:35:52,856
Why not?

686
00:35:52,889 --> 00:35:55,589
Your people fought
against us for 50 years

687
00:35:55,629 --> 00:35:58,694
with much less sophisticated
weaponry than this

688
00:35:58,737 --> 00:35:59,706
and you beat us.

689
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,039
It's not the same.

690
00:36:01,077 --> 00:36:02,603
The Bajoran people were united.

691
00:36:02,648 --> 00:36:04,619
We were all fighting
for the same goal.

692
00:36:04,653 --> 00:36:06,989
You and your crew
would be out there alone.

693
00:36:07,026 --> 00:36:09,794
Maybe at first,
but perhaps our actions

694
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:12,328
would inspire others
to join the struggle.

695
00:36:12,406 --> 00:36:14,776
It's not that easy, Dukat.

696
00:36:14,813 --> 00:36:16,305
I know...

697
00:36:20,427 --> 00:36:22,455
which is why I need you.

698
00:36:22,499 --> 00:36:23,468
Me?

699
00:36:23,502 --> 00:36:24,562
Who else?

700
00:36:24,605 --> 00:36:26,735
You know how to organize
a resistance cell

701
00:36:26,777 --> 00:36:29,375
you're an expert
in terrorist tactics

702
00:36:29,451 --> 00:36:30,715
you have close ties

703
00:36:30,754 --> 00:36:33,249
with Bajoran
and Federation officials

704
00:36:33,294 --> 00:36:35,789
and besides all that,
it would give you a chance

705
00:36:35,834 --> 00:36:37,566
to do what you were meant to do.

706
00:36:37,606 --> 00:36:39,976
No, thanks.

707
00:36:40,011 --> 00:36:41,241
I've already got a job.

708
00:36:41,281 --> 00:36:43,275
Oh! What do you mean?

709
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,416
On that space station?

710
00:36:45,492 --> 00:36:48,933
We both know your talents
are being wasted there.

711
00:36:48,968 --> 00:36:51,736
Coordinating docking assignments

712
00:36:51,775 --> 00:36:53,803
and leading training exercises.

713
00:36:53,847 --> 00:36:57,448
On Deep Space 9,
you're nothing but a bureaucrat.

714
00:36:57,523 --> 00:36:58,787
An administrator.

715
00:36:58,826 --> 00:37:02,529
If you come with me,
you can be a soldier again.

716
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:06,707
Think about it, Major...
the chance to fight

717
00:37:06,747 --> 00:37:10,188
against a superior foe
in a righteous cause.

718
00:37:10,223 --> 00:37:13,391
To protect a defeated
and broken people

719
00:37:13,432 --> 00:37:15,198
from a cruel aggressor.

720
00:37:15,236 --> 00:37:18,973
You know as well as I do
that, if Cardassia falls

721
00:37:19,013 --> 00:37:21,815
Bajor is next.

722
00:37:21,853 --> 00:37:24,189
Help me stop the Klingons

723
00:37:24,226 --> 00:37:27,667
before you become
their next target.

724
00:37:27,702 --> 00:37:30,436
You're really serious
about this.

725
00:37:30,476 --> 00:37:32,710
Absolutely!

726
00:37:32,749 --> 00:37:37,990
Look, Major,
I'm not asking you to like me

727
00:37:38,029 --> 00:37:40,365
or to be my friend.

728
00:37:40,402 --> 00:37:43,638
I'm asking you to join me.

729
00:37:43,677 --> 00:37:46,172
To fight at my side.

730
00:37:46,216 --> 00:37:50,158
You know
what I'm doing is right

731
00:37:50,194 --> 00:37:53,430
and it's what you
want to do as well.

732
00:37:53,469 --> 00:37:56,409
I know that our past
makes it difficult

733
00:37:56,443 --> 00:37:58,779
for you to accept me
as an ally.

734
00:37:58,816 --> 00:38:01,984
I also know that every fiber
of your being

735
00:38:02,024 --> 00:38:04,462
is telling you
to say "no, no, no"

736
00:38:04,497 --> 00:38:08,269
but somewhere,
I know there's a "yes."

737
00:38:08,307 --> 00:38:12,410
You need to listen
to that "yes."

738
00:38:12,451 --> 00:38:17,226
Not for my sake,
not for Cardassia's

739
00:38:17,264 --> 00:38:20,295
not even for Bajor's...

740
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,743
but for your sake.

741
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:27,550
We've completed repairs
on the navigation system

742
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,923
and the cloaking device.

743
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,631
Good. We'll leave
as soon as you have it on line.

744
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:38,106
Think about it, Major.

745
00:38:40,123 --> 00:38:44,031
Think about the possibilities.

746
00:38:54,928 --> 00:38:57,526
Nerys.

747
00:38:57,568 --> 00:38:59,836
I want to show you something.

748
00:38:59,875 --> 00:39:01,208
Go ahead, attack me.

749
00:39:01,245 --> 00:39:02,840
What are you talking about?

750
00:39:02,883 --> 00:39:03,977
It's okay.

751
00:39:04,018 --> 00:39:05,214
I know what I'm doing.

752
00:39:05,255 --> 00:39:06,850
Damar showed me a good trick.

753
00:39:06,893 --> 00:39:08,591
Try to stab me with the knife.

754
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,350
Guess it wasn't
such a good trick.

755
00:39:20,395 --> 00:39:23,163
The best way
to survive a knife fight

756
00:39:23,201 --> 00:39:24,933
is to never get in one.

757
00:39:27,279 --> 00:39:28,839
If I'm going to help my father

758
00:39:28,883 --> 00:39:30,786
I have to be prepared
for anything.

759
00:39:30,821 --> 00:39:33,521
Show me what you did.

760
00:39:33,562 --> 00:39:35,362
Please.

761
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,166
I know I have a lot to learn.

762
00:39:37,204 --> 00:39:39,768
I have been practicing
with the disruptor rifle

763
00:39:39,812 --> 00:39:41,976
but I need to know
how to defend myself

764
00:39:42,017 --> 00:39:44,045
in hand-to-hand combat.

765
00:39:44,089 --> 00:39:47,257
I was lucky not to have to fight
when we boarded this ship.

766
00:39:47,298 --> 00:39:49,030
I may not be so lucky next time.

767
00:39:49,068 --> 00:39:50,698
Chances are, you won't be.

768
00:39:50,773 --> 00:39:53,804
Fighting the Klingons
is going to take more

769
00:39:53,848 --> 00:39:57,118
than knowing how to fire a rifle
or use a knife.

770
00:39:57,156 --> 00:39:59,458
You have to learn
to be ruthless.

771
00:39:59,496 --> 00:40:02,334
You have to learn
to hate the Klingons...

772
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:04,740
even more
than you hated the Breen.

773
00:40:04,843 --> 00:40:07,315
Whatever it takes, I will do it

774
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:10,016
but I'm going to need your help.

775
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,090
You're right.

776
00:40:13,131 --> 00:40:15,626
You do need my help.

777
00:40:17,876 --> 00:40:20,975
I... am disappointed, Major.

778
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:23,046
But not surprised.

779
00:40:25,096 --> 00:40:27,432
Tell me...

780
00:40:27,469 --> 00:40:30,067
were you even tempted?

781
00:40:30,109 --> 00:40:31,476
Not really.

782
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:35,649
Hmm.
I thought I was so eloquent.

783
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:38,060
You had your moments

784
00:40:38,096 --> 00:40:39,794
but the fact of the matter is

785
00:40:39,833 --> 00:40:42,101
I've already been
where you're going.

786
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,612
I've lived the life
you're choosing...

787
00:40:44,646 --> 00:40:47,244
fighting hit-and-run,
always outgunned

788
00:40:47,286 --> 00:40:49,314
living on hate
and adrenaline...

789
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:52,231
it's not much of a life.

790
00:40:52,266 --> 00:40:53,667
And it eats away at you

791
00:40:53,703 --> 00:40:56,335
so that every day a
little bit of you dies.

792
00:40:56,377 --> 00:40:58,473
Very inspiring, Major.

793
00:40:58,515 --> 00:41:03,756
But I don't have
any choice in this...

794
00:41:03,796 --> 00:41:08,832
no more than you had
when you fought against us.

795
00:41:08,876 --> 00:41:10,676
No, I don't suppose you do.

796
00:41:10,714 --> 00:41:12,685
Hmm.

797
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:17,849
Well... all that's left
is for you to wish me luck.

798
00:41:17,982 --> 00:41:20,146
That's not quite all.

799
00:41:20,188 --> 00:41:22,250
There's still Ziyal.

800
00:41:22,327 --> 00:41:24,161
What about her?

801
00:41:24,198 --> 00:41:27,570
The life you're choosing
isn't for her.

802
00:41:27,608 --> 00:41:29,374
She deserves better.

803
00:41:29,413 --> 00:41:32,079
She deserves to be
with her father.

804
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:33,554
You taught me that.

805
00:41:33,589 --> 00:41:35,526
I love her.

806
00:41:35,562 --> 00:41:37,465
I know you do

807
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,768
and that's why you've got
to let her go.

808
00:41:39,806 --> 00:41:42,210
Go? Where?

809
00:41:42,245 --> 00:41:45,914
She's not welcome
on Cardassia or Bajor.

810
00:41:45,955 --> 00:41:49,157
This is the only place
she belongs.

811
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:52,461
That's not true.

812
00:41:54,243 --> 00:41:56,681
She could come
to Deep Space 9 with me.

813
00:42:04,604 --> 00:42:06,268
Are you serious?

814
00:42:06,308 --> 00:42:09,248
She's a remarkable young woman.

815
00:42:09,282 --> 00:42:10,946
I'll make sure she's okay.

816
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:13,015
Why?

817
00:42:13,059 --> 00:42:15,623
Why do you care so much?

818
00:42:18,072 --> 00:42:21,980
Because she reminds me
of myself...

819
00:42:22,016 --> 00:42:28,124
and I don't want her to go
through what I went through

820
00:42:28,165 --> 00:42:31,162
and neither do you.

821
00:42:38,225 --> 00:42:41,290
Captain, a Klingon bird-of-prey
just de-cloaked off the station.

822
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:42,529
On screen.

823
00:42:45,409 --> 00:42:47,039
They're hailing us.

824
00:42:47,081 --> 00:42:48,847
Let's find out what they want.

825
00:42:48,886 --> 00:42:50,116
Sir, it's Gul Dukat.

826
00:42:50,156 --> 00:42:52,754
On a Klingon ship?

827
00:42:52,795 --> 00:42:55,792
He's asking permission
to dock.

828
00:43:00,081 --> 00:43:03,955
When this is all over,
I'll come back for you.

829
00:43:03,991 --> 00:43:05,621
I promise you that.

830
00:43:05,662 --> 00:43:07,633
I know you will.

831
00:43:09,472 --> 00:43:11,102
Major...

832
00:43:12,714 --> 00:43:14,412
I'll take good care of her.

833
00:43:14,485 --> 00:43:16,115
I know.

834
00:43:16,156 --> 00:43:18,127
Well, Major, it appears

835
00:43:18,161 --> 00:43:20,895
that whether you like it or not

836
00:43:20,935 --> 00:43:24,433
our lives have become
deeply intertwined.

837
00:43:24,545 --> 00:43:27,713
That really pleases you,
doesn't it?

838
00:43:27,753 --> 00:43:29,656
Pleases me?

839
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:33,189
Major, it gives me
reason to live.

840
00:43:51,882 --> 00:43:53,181
Come.

841
00:43:53,218 --> 00:43:54,687
I'll show you to your quarters.

842
00:43:54,723 --> 00:43:55,851
Welcome back, Major.

843
00:43:55,893 --> 00:43:57,796
Odo, this is Tora Ziyal.

844
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,269
Gul Dukat's daughter.

845
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,674
She going to be living here
on the station with us...

846
00:44:02,711 --> 00:44:03,771
for a while.

847
00:44:03,813 --> 00:44:05,282
Ah.

848
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:08,518
I'll tell you all about it.

849
00:44:11,533 --> 00:44:13,527
I certainly hope so.
