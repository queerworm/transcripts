1
00:00:02,586 --> 00:00:04,171
(<i> Kira sighing</i> )

2
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:06,465
Is all this
really necessary?

3
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:08,133
The Klingon invasion
has all but destroyed

4
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:09,885
the Cardassian
health system.

5
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:11,929
They're suffering outbreaks
of all kinds of diseases

6
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:13,639
and in epidemic proportions.

7
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,307
Besides, you've only got
12 more inoculations to go.

8
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:17,476
Twelve?
Sorry,

9
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:19,186
but if you want to go
to the conference...

10
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:22,189
I don't want to go.
I'm no diplomat.

11
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:26,025
Going to some obscure
Cardassian outpost

12
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:28,195
to share Bajoran intelligence
about the Klingons

13
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,447
isn't exactly
something I'm good at.

14
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:33,033
I don't know why I even agreed
to go in the first place.

15
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,661
You agreed to go because
it was a personal request

16
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:38,163
from the First Minister
of Bajor.

17
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:41,082
Oh, it was a personal request,
all right.

18
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:44,920
Shakaar took me to my favorite
restaurant in Jalanda City,

19
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,798
poured me glass after glass
of spring wine,

20
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:50,801
and then took me to his home
and gave me a massage

21
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,427
with Kolaish
spice oil.

22
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,179
Well... nice to know
he's keeping in touch

23
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,639
with his constituents.

24
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,641
It wasn't fair.

25
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:00,227
I mean, I would have said yes
to anything at that point.

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,604
Ah...

27
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,899
Ah...
What is it?

28
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:06,483
I'm seeing spots.

29
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,943
Big, green swirling ones?

30
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:09,653
The size of
Alvinian melons.

31
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:11,363
And is the room
beginning to spin?
Yes.

32
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:13,574
Good. It means the vaccine's
beginning to work.

33
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:16,159
Everything will settle down
in a moment.

34
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,203
Major, may I speak
with you?

35
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,247
Uh, I'm not going
anywhere.

36
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:23,124
This one's going to make you
feel a little queasy.
Ah.

37
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:27,170
If you have something
to say to the Major,
you better make it fast.

38
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,130
The Federation
has some concerns

39
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,466
about your upcoming meeting
with the Cardassians.

40
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,968
So do I.

41
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:35,178
There are certain
technological advances

42
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,765
that we have shared with
both Bajor and the Klingons

43
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:40,017
that we'd prefer to keep
out of Cardassian hands.

44
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,393
Such as?

45
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:44,187
Photon torpedo
guidance systems...

46
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,981
long-range sensors...

47
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:48,233
enhanced warp core
overdrives.

48
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,735
This is a complete list.

49
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:53,154
(<i> groaning</i> ):
Oh. Well...

50
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:54,823
I think the Cardassians
are going to be

51
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,450
a little disappointed.

52
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,492
Undoubtedly.

53
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,954
Is that all?
Yes.

54
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:02,039
Oh, good.
I'll be right back.

55
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,086
I'm glad I'm not going
to Cardassia.

56
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:15,135
(<i> door chimes</i> )

57
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,303
Come in.

58
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,223
Hello, Major.

59
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,558
Dukat...

60
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,226
what are you doing here?

61
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:26,438
I'm to escort you
to your meeting on Korma.

62
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,231
You're commanding
the<i> Groumall?</i>

63
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,358
Thanks to you.
If you had not convinced me

64
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:33,487
to bring my half-Bajoran
daughter back to Cardassia,

65
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,405
I'd still be
Chief Military Advisor

66
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,740
to the Detapa
Council.

67
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,533
They demoted you.

68
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,201
(<i> chuckles</i> )

69
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:43,288
Exactly one week after
my mother disowned me

70
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:47,375
and my wife took
our children and left.

71
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,757
You still did
the right thing, Dukat.

72
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:56,760
And as a reward for
following your advice,

73
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,348
I have been relegated
to ferrying freight.

74
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,433
And, occasionally

75
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:07,270
various foreign dignitaries,
such as yourself.

76
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:12,734
Look, if it makes you
feel better to blame me,
go right ahead.

77
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:17,114
No, no, no.
I blame no one--
but myself.

78
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:20,075
I was indiscreet.

79
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:24,454
I compromised myself and have
been punished accordingly.

80
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,666
If someone under my command
had behaved so outrageously,

81
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,335
I would do
the same thing to him.

82
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:34,506
Besides, I assure you, this is
only a temporary setback.

83
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:39,386
Everything I have lost...
I will regain.

84
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,972
It's only a matter
of time.

85
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,515
Now...

86
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,268
may I take your bags?

87
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,770
Please?

88
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,196
(<i> door chimes</i> )

89
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,119
Come in.

90
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,663
Ziyal...

91
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,832
I didn't know
you were on board.

92
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,292
Hello, Major.

93
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:18,128
Oh, please, call me Nerys.

94
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:24,509
So, I take it
living on Cardassia

95
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,427
didn't work out
very well.

96
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:30,182
I wasn't exactly welcomed
with open arms.

97
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,600
There were some Cardassians
who could see past

98
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,021
the Bajoran ridges on my nose,
but not many.

99
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:40,734
I'm sorry.
I know it must have been
very difficult for you.

100
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:44,654
The only good thing
about living on Cardassia
was being with my father.

101
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,824
I'm glad the two of you
are getting along.

102
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,493
He's been wonderful.
And so brave.

103
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,329
He never tried to hide me away.

104
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,873
He never acted
like he was ashamed of me.

105
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:58,585
We'd go out to dinner together,
take long walks.

106
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,837
And now that he's been exiled?

107
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,131
Wherever he goes, I go.

108
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,217
He's the only family I have.

109
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,304
And this is
the only home I need.

110
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,808
Your father isn't the only one
who's brave.

111
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:14,851
(<i> alarm sounds</i> )

112
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,395
What's that?

113
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:18,521
It's a battle drill.

114
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,358
On a freighter?

115
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,944
Target at 400,000 kilometers
and closing.

116
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,821
Shields at maximum.
Maintain scan.

117
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,074
Engineering and tactical ready.

118
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,825
Waiting on weapons, sir.

119
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,036
What's taking so long?

120
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,122
The phaser banks
are still charging.

121
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:38,417
I want those weapons
on line now.

122
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:40,627
OFFICER:
Phasers ready.

123
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:41,920
Lock on target.

124
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,380
Target set.

125
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:45,382
Fire!

126
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:50,595
Time.

127
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,180
Three forty-seven.

128
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,599
(<i> sighing</i> ):
That's pitiful.

129
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,727
A crew of Ferengi scrap peddlers
could do better than that.

130
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,729
Select
another target.

131
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,815
We'll do it again.
Aye, sir.

132
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,738
This may be a lowly
freighter, Major,

133
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,991
but it's still
a military vessel

134
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:14,077
and will be run
in a military manner.

135
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,330
You know...

136
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,915
you could speed up
your phaser recharge time

137
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,460
by routing power through
an anodyne capacitor.

138
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,339
Thank you, Major.
That's very helpful.

139
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:29,426
And if we had an anodyne
capacitor, we would use it.

140
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:30,844
But we don't.

141
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,596
Major...

142
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:37,309
(<i> sighing</i> ):
Please forgive me.

143
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:40,854
I do appreciate your suggestion.

144
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:46,526
Any anger I may have expressed
is due to my...

145
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:52,699
frustration over the complete
inadequacy of this... vessel.

146
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,123
I hope you'll allow me
to make it up to you.

147
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:02,000
What did you have in mind?

148
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,170
I was hoping we might
have dinner together.

149
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,755
After all,
it is Cardassian tradition

150
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,425
for the Commanding Officer
of a ship

151
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:12,344
to entertain his guests.

152
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:20,060
Far be it from me to stand
in the way of tradition.

153
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,895
(<i> sighs</i> )

154
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,529
This is Bajoran
spring wine.

155
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:32,989
My last bottle.

156
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:36,201
It's one of the things
I miss most about Bajor.

157
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,621
I talked to Ziyal.

158
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,457
She's a lovely girl.

159
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:48,505
I'm very glad that you
convinced me not to kill her.

160
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:51,091
Despite everything
that's happened?

161
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:56,263
You may not believe this,
Major, but when it
comes to Ziyal

162
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,139
I regret nothing.

163
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,476
It's good to hear that.

164
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,144
By the way, Major,

165
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:06,106
what it this I hear
about you and Shakaar?

166
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,942
I don't know what you've heard.

167
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:12,237
First, it was
Vedek Bareil,

168
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,948
and now it's the head
of the Bajoran government.

169
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,410
You do like powerful
men, don't you?

170
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,954
First of all,
Shakaar's an old friend.

171
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,998
Second of all,
what business is it of yours?

172
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:28,211
Let's just say it's further
incentive for me to regain my...

173
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:29,921
former position.

174
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,427
It's good to see you haven't
lost your sense of humor.

175
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:41,349
I must say I've always admired
Shakaar's success with women.

176
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:44,978
The intelligence file I kept
on him during the occupation

177
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:48,440
is filled with reports
of his conquests.

178
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,525
In fact, if you
remember correctly,

179
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:53,945
<i>you</i> were
the only female
in his resistance cell

180
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:56,739
that he didn't... charm.

181
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,783
At least until now.

182
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,453
Is that what you kept track of
during the occupation?

183
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:02,996
No wonder you lost.

184
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,748
(<i> chuckling</i> )

185
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,292
More wine, Major?

186
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:08,668
(<i> alarm sounds</i> )

187
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,044
Another drill?

188
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:13,672
I didn't schedule one.

189
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:17,969
Sir, we're approaching
the outpost on Korma--
or what's left of it.

190
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:19,678
What are you
talking about?

191
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,640
From what we can tell,
it's been attacked.

192
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,350
The planetary defense systems
have been disabled.

193
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,059
Every building
has been destroyed.

194
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,187
How many casualties?
There are no life-signs.

195
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,772
Then we have to assume
that everyone
at the outpost,

196
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:33,109
including the Cardassian
and the Bajoran
dignitaries, is dead.

197
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,570
Sir, I'm reading
a subspace distortion

198
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,696
bearing 001,
mark 15.

199
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:38,906
On screen.

200
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,168
Klingons...

201
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:56,883
They're scanning
us, sir.

202
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,717
Full power
to forward shields.

203
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:01,221
At this distance, your
shields won't mean much.

204
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,683
Sir, they've stopped
scanning us.

205
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:06,767
What are they doing?

206
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,564
Nothing, sir. They don't
seem to be in a hurry

207
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,106
to do anything
about us.

208
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,192
They don't think
we're a threat, Dukat.

209
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,444
Then why were they cloaked
when we arrived?

210
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,196
They detected
an incoming vessel.

211
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:20,490
They didn't know what
it was, so they hid.

212
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,741
Now they know and
they're unconcerned.

213
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:25,453
The Klingon ship
has lowered its shields.

214
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,955
They're moving off
at one-quarter impulse.

215
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:30,709
They'll pay
for their arrogance.

216
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,419
Charge phaser banks.

217
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,003
What are you doing, Dukat?

218
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,339
You can't go up against
a bird-of-prey.

219
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,757
Must I remind you, Major,

220
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:41,177
they just murdered your people
as well as mine?

221
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:45,265
I know that, but getting
all of<i> us</i> killed isn't
going to change that.

222
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,808
We're the only Cardassian ship
in the area.

223
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:51,229
I'm not going to let
these Klingons escape
unchallenged.

224
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:53,356
You attack them, and
all you're going to do

225
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,358
is give them a little
target practice.

226
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,736
They're going
to blow us to pieces
with their first shot.

227
00:12:57,736 --> 00:13:00,905
Phaser banks charged.
Lock phasers on target.

228
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,824
Phasers locked.
Dukat!

229
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,744
At least lock on
to the underside of their hull.

230
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,704
It's their
weakest spot.

231
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,163
You heard the Major.

232
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,207
Target set.

233
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,126
Fire.

234
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,298
Their shields
were down

235
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,550
and we didn't penetrate
their hull.

236
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,595
Divert all power
to forward shields.

237
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:24,721
Aye, sir.

238
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,526
They've gone to warp.

239
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,530
Well...

240
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:50,163
it would seem we're not...
worth destroying.

241
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,707
Lucky for us.

242
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,714
I suppose from
their point of view...

243
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:06,721
there's no honor in destroying
a worthless freighter.

244
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,145
I have to inform
Central Command.

245
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:17,940
These Klingons
have been operating

246
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,653
behind our lines with impunity.

247
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:23,946
Someone has got to stop them.

248
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,617
(<i> sighs</i> )

249
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,952
Someone else.

250
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:33,164
How close is the nearest
Cardassian warship?

251
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,837
Probably in the Dopa system
somewhere.

252
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:40,880
That's almost
three days away.

253
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,675
By the time they
get here, the Klingons
will be long gone.

254
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:47,637
That's true, but what
can we do about it?

255
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:50,181
We can go after
the Klingons.

256
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:58,105
A moment ago,
<i>you</i> were advising caution.

257
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:59,649
That's because a moment ago

258
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:02,109
we were in no position
to fight back.

259
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,821
I have no intention
of letting them get away
with what they did.

260
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,989
Now, you said
scanners showed

261
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,242
that the outpost
disruptors were disabled,

262
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,619
not destroyed, right?
Correct.

263
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:15,582
Dukat, do you think
you'd be able to repair
one of those disruptors?

264
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:19,085
What would be the point?
I doubt we can lure the Klingons
back to the outpost.

265
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,546
Maybe not, but
there's no reason

266
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:24,215
we can't make a few
alterations to your ship.

267
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:29,053
What kind of...
alterations?

268
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:32,139
Here? In the cargo hold?

269
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,892
Why not?

270
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:37,645
Well, because the outpost's
planetary defense weapons

271
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,440
are system 5 disruptors.

272
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,569
They were never designed
to operate aboard
a moving spacecraft.

273
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:48,072
And these cargo bays
were never designed
to hold them.

274
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,533
Dukat, you are going
to have to stop thinking

275
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:53,286
like a Cardassian
military officer.

276
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,704
And more like you?

277
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,456
More like
a resistance fighter.

278
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,416
You have got to make
use of what you have.

279
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,335
If you need a hammer
and you don't have one,
use a pipe.

280
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:05,673
And you really think
we can make those weapons
operational on this ship?

281
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,049
It's worth a try.

282
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:13,097
I suppose if we disable
the tractor beam,

283
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,683
we could reroute
enough power

284
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,394
to operate one
of the disruptors.

285
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,230
But those weapons are huge.

286
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,483
What do we do
with all this cargo?
Get rid of it.

287
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,736
All of it?

288
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,739
I realize it's traditional
for a Cardassian Captain

289
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:31,866
to take a percentage
of the haul,

290
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:34,285
but you are going to have
to shed a lot of traditions

291
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,788
if you are serious about
fighting the Klingons.

292
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:40,583
Some traditions
are hard to break.

293
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,837
You'll get used to it.

294
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:57,266
You... never cease
to impress me, Major.

295
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,061
I have a lot
to learn from you.

296
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,655
Target at 500,000 kilometers.

297
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,907
System 5 disruptor
on line.

298
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:14,534
Open cargo bay doors.

299
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:15,827
Doors opening.

300
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:18,579
Telemetry lock confirmed.

301
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,247
Are you ready?

302
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:23,417
Diverting all power
to your station.

303
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,170
200,000 kilometers and closing.

304
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,255
Fire!

305
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,429
Very impressive, Major!

306
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,348
Don't be too
impressed yet, Dukat.

307
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:39,099
We still have
some problems.

308
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,435
Firing the disruptor
ruptured power relays

309
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,521
and plasma circuits
all over the ship.

310
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:46,524
We have small plasma leaks
in Levels 2, 4 and 5.

311
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:49,109
I want those leaks
fixed immediately.
Aye, sir.

312
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:51,738
We're going to have
to do something
about that recoil.

313
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:55,783
Major, I'm confident
you'll have that disruptor
running so smoothly

314
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,953
it wouldn't wake
a sleeping child.

315
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,872
(<i> laughing</i> )

316
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:03,791
Why is it, when you smile,
I want to leave the room?

317
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:07,294
I suppose it's because
of my overwhelming charm.

318
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:10,130
But you must admit
it is rather amusing.

319
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,467
When we do destroy
that bird-of-prey,

320
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:19,181
it will no doubt go a long way
toward restoring my reputation--

321
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,601
and I have you
to thank for it.

322
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:24,228
I'm trying not to think
about that.

323
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,439
Major...

324
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:30,068
why are you so reluctant
to face the obvious?

325
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:31,694
We make an excellent team.

326
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:33,279
We are not
a team, Dukat,

327
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,031
and we have
nothing in common.

328
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:37,033
The only reason
I'm helping you

329
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,827
is because those Klingons
killed 15 Bajoran diplomats.

330
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,413
There were Cardassians
at that outpost, too.

331
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:45,124
Maybe.
But all you care about
is redeeming yourself

332
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,918
in the eyes of the
Cardassian government.

333
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:49,003
You have seen an opportunity
for advancement

334
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,421
and you are grabbing it.

335
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:51,714
(<i> exasperated sigh</i> )

336
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:55,927
You judge me too harshly.

337
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:59,806
Maybe I<i> am</i> seeking to
regain my former position--

338
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:02,976
one which I earned
through hard work,

339
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:05,728
dedication
and sacrifice.

340
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:10,691
But redemption is not
my sole motivation.

341
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,611
I care about my people,

342
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:17,490
and I don't intend
to allow the Klingons

343
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,660
to get away
with murdering them.

344
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,665
I'm a much more
complicated man

345
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,166
than you give me
credit for.

346
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,751
Well, if that's true,

347
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:31,295
I suppose I prefer
simpler men.

348
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,547
Like Shakaar?

349
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:36,425
It amazes me
that a woman

350
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:39,512
as intelligent and
sophisticated as you

351
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:43,057
could be attracted
to such a lumbering,
simplistic field hand.

352
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:47,353
I mean, what could
the two of you
possibly talk about?

353
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:51,065
That lumbering field hand
is the First Minister of Bajor,

354
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:54,861
and he knows more
about how to talk to me
than you ever will.

355
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:56,988
How can you be so sure?

356
00:19:56,988 --> 00:20:00,491
After all, you don't
know me well enough
to make a comparison.

357
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:02,994
I don't want
to know you well enough.

358
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:05,705
And if you want
to keep working with me,

359
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:08,582
I suggest you stick to business.

360
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,461
I'm sorry, Major.

361
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,505
I didn't mean any harm.

362
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:17,008
I was only making conversation.

363
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,015
Damar,
set another target.

364
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:25,850
We'll test
our new weapon

365
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,061
as soon as
the Major's ready.

366
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:30,897
Let's see if we can't
work out our problems,

367
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:33,607
at least the ones we're
having with the disruptor.

368
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,112
KIRA:
This is a standard issue

369
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:40,406
Cardassian phase-
disruptor rifle.

370
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:43,826
It has a 4.7 megajoule
power capacity,

371
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:47,329
three-millisecond recharge,
two beam settings.

372
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,124
How do you know so much
about Cardassian weapons?

373
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:52,919
We captured a lot of them
during the occupation.

374
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,671
It's a good weapon--
solid, simple.

375
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,465
You can drag it
through the mud
and it'll still fire.

376
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:03,137
Now, this... this is
an entirely different animal.

377
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:05,056
Federation standard issue.

378
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:08,684
It's a little less powerful,
but it's got a lot more options.

379
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:12,312
16 beam settings.
Fully autonomous...

380
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:14,065
recharge...

381
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:16,067
multiple
target acquisition...

382
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:18,736
gyro stabilized,
the works.

383
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:21,572
It's, um, a little
more complicated,

384
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:23,824
so it's not
as good a field weapon.

385
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,576
Too many things
can go wrong with it.

386
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:28,955
I can see why my father
likes having you around.

387
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:32,583
I think, um...

388
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,794
you should stick
with the Cardassian rifle.

389
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:38,297
It's smaller, easier to use,
and if we get boarded

390
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,425
I don't want you
to have to think too much
about the weapon you're using.

391
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:44,804
You don't
like my father
very much, do you?

392
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:47,556
No. I don't.

393
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,185
I understand.

394
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:54,563
He did some very bad things
during the occupation.

395
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,194
Yes, he did.

396
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:01,737
It bothers him,
you know.

397
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,572
Does it?
Very much.

398
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,741
He talks about
it sometimes.

399
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,077
He'd never admit it
to anyone else,

400
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:10,579
but he thinks the
occupation was a mistake.

401
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,748
Somehow I don't think
he'd say that

402
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,374
if the Cardassians had won.

403
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:16,085
Maybe not.

404
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:18,587
But maybe losing made
him a better person.

405
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:22,424
Well, then a lot
of innocent people died
for his education.

406
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:25,761
I... I know.
I think about that a lot.

407
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,889
But when I look at my father
I have a hard time
seeing a murderer.

408
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,599
And when I look at him

409
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,559
I have a hard time
seeing anything else.

410
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,899
You're his daughter.

411
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,610
My father says
that the two of you
have a lot in common.

412
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,822
That you both did things
during the war that you regret.

413
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:47,825
That's why he cares so much
about what you think of him.

414
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:51,912
Ziyal, what your father
wants from me

415
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,747
is forgiveness.

416
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:57,043
That's one thing
I can never give him.

417
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:01,088
Now...

418
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,923
I think we
should concentrate

419
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,967
on getting you comfortable
with this weapon.

420
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:12,558
What about
the Cardassian base

421
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,560
on the fourth moon
of Rakal?

422
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,104
Mmm. It's subterranean.

423
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:20,816
It's much too fortified
to be a viable target
for a bird-of-prey.

424
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,443
It would take
a Vor'cha-class cruiser

425
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:25,612
to do any real damage.

426
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:29,950
How about the station
on Amleth Prime?

427
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:34,121
No, the Amleth system's located
inside an emission nebula.

428
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:37,083
The Klingon cloaking device
would be useless.

429
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:41,837
I know where they'll go next--
Loval.

430
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,048
That's on the other side
of the sector.

431
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:47,509
A long way from
the Cardassian fleet.

432
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:55,184
From what it says here,

433
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:56,977
Loval is mainly
a civilian outpost

434
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,563
with a small
subspace relay station.

435
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,732
The Klingons have been going
after a lot bigger prizes.

436
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:05,194
What it says there
is not exactly true.

437
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:08,530
Loval is also
a weapons research installation,

438
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,909
which is supposed to be
a closely guarded secret.

439
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:15,871
Now, considering the targets
the Klingons have hit so far...

440
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:21,377
I think we've underestimated
their intelligence network.

441
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:26,215
Sounds like a choice target.

442
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:28,508
Loval it is.

443
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:33,222
The question is...

444
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:37,475
even if we're right,
can we stop them?

445
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:40,980
All we need
is one good shot
with the new disruptor.

446
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,941
Which won't
be easy to get,

447
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:45,859
considering
they'll be cloaked.

448
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,445
We don't have
to find them.

449
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:49,487
We have to make
them come to us.

450
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:52,366
Lure them in.

451
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:55,493
Make them think that we're
a helpless freighter.

452
00:24:55,493 --> 00:25:00,291
We have to make them
think that we have
valuable cargo aboard.

453
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,503
How does refined
dilithium crystal sound?

454
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:10,843
I can get Damar to modify
the subspace transceiver array

455
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:14,221
to emit a false
dilithium signal.

456
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,307
Now, if I know the Klingons,

457
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:19,977
they'll lock
their tractor beam on us
and try to take our cargo.

458
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:22,271
And we'll have a little surprise
waiting for them.

459
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:23,439
Yes.

460
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:25,358
Not bad.

461
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:28,861
I told you
we make a good team, Major.

462
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:33,282
You are as insightful a woman
as you are intriguing.

463
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:39,413
I thought we agreed
to keep this
strictly business.

464
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:41,499
Major, is it
my imagination,

465
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:44,751
or do you have a hard time
accepting compliments?

466
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:48,047
I have a hard time accepting
compliments from you.

467
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:51,800
Well, I'll try
to restrain my enthusiasm,

468
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,303
but I can't make you
any promises.

469
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:56,889
We better get to Loval
before the Klingons do.

470
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:01,185
Damar.
Sir?

471
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:04,146
Set a course for Loval.

472
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:06,315
Maximum warp.

473
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:07,900
Aye, sir.

474
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:14,490
Loval system
within scanning range, sir.

475
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,033
Any sign of them?

476
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:19,412
No, sir.

477
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:21,955
If they're not there now,
they'll be there
soon enough.

478
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:27,420
Begin modifications to the
subspace transceiver array.

479
00:26:37,555 --> 00:26:40,640
We soldiers spend
a lot of time waiting,

480
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,768
don't we, Major?

481
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:46,313
It's not easy to keep
your mind from drifting.

482
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:49,191
I don't usually have any
trouble concentrating

483
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:51,360
unless I'm
being distracted.

484
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,820
Lately, when my mind wanders,

485
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,908
I find myself thinking
more and more about...

486
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:01,912
Gul Marratt.

487
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:03,497
Do you know him?

488
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:05,791
Very dashing.

489
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:12,047
One of Cardassia's
rising stars--

490
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:16,093
graduate of the Cardassian
Military Academy...

491
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:20,889
smooth-talking junior member
of the Detapa Council...

492
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:25,102
and like your friend Shakaar...

493
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:27,229
quite a ladies' man.

494
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:31,191
Especially with
other officers' wives.

495
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,734
Including yours?

496
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,861
Mmm.

497
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:39,158
A year ago, he wouldn't
have dared, but now...

498
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:44,288
I think the first thing I do
when I'm restored to power

499
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:46,290
will be to demote him.

500
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:51,086
Assign him to
the Cardassian
Embassy on Breen.

501
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,046
(<i> chuckling</i> )

502
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:57,551
I hear it's bitter cold
on Breen.

503
00:27:57,551 --> 00:28:02,181
And we Cardassians
do despise the cold.

504
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:03,890
Sir. I've got something.

505
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:06,684
On screen.

506
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:13,275
Well, Major...

507
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:20,157
it seems fate has smiled
on our little plan.

508
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,710
They're scanning us.

509
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,588
Good.

510
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:37,257
Let's hope they
take the bait.

511
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,845
Sir, they've locked
their disruptors on us.

512
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:44,890
They haven't fired.

513
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:48,644
Which means they could be
interested in our cargo.

514
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:51,397
They're hailing us, sir.
Demanding our surrender.

515
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:54,733
They're interested.
Now let's see if you
can make them bite.

516
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:58,445
On screen.

517
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:01,823
Identify yourself.

518
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,076
I'm Gul Dukat,

519
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:07,871
Commander of the Cardassian
Freighter<i> Groumall.</i>
Who are you?

520
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:11,041
What is your cargo
and destination?

521
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:15,837
We are carrying replicator
and transporter parts
to the Dopa system.

522
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,339
You're lying!

523
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:19,383
I assure you, Captain...

524
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:22,135
I'm confiscating your ship
<i>and</i> its cargo.

525
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,221
On whose authority?

526
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:25,764
(<i> chuckling</i> )

527
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:29,476
On the authority
of the Klingon Empire

528
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:33,188
and the disruptors
I have pointed at your vessel.

529
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,026
Convincing, wasn't I?

530
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,361
I'll let you know.

531
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,906
They've locked
their tractor beam on us.

532
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:47,494
Wait for my signal.

533
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:50,330
Wait...

534
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,710
Open the cargo bay doors.

535
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,128
Doors opening.

536
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:00,882
Fire.

537
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,597
We've breached their hull.

538
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:09,099
Their impulse engines are down.
They're adrift.

539
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:10,684
Excellent.

540
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:15,397
They're re-locking
their disruptors on us.

541
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:17,775
All power
to forward shields.

542
00:30:26,617 --> 00:30:28,744
Damage?

543
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:31,246
Both shields are down
to 20 percent!

544
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,373
We can't sustain
another hit!

545
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,875
I think it's time
to improvise!

546
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:40,297
I want all power
to the disruptors, now!

547
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:42,675
You, get down
to the weapons room

548
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:44,843
and find out what's
taking them so long.

549
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,158
Major!
Just give me a minute.

550
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,954
Hurry, Major.

551
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:15,499
Quiet. I need
to concentrate.

552
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:17,835
Lock target.

553
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:19,252
Prepare to fire.

554
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:36,395
You are a magician, Major.

555
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:38,731
There's nothing magical
about it.

556
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:41,191
Not when you know
Klingon transporter codes.

557
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:48,615
It worked.
All our people are here,

558
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:51,117
and all 36 Klingons
are on the freighter.

559
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:53,953
Oh, I can just imagine
that Klingon Captain

560
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:56,206
explaining this
to his superiors.

561
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:58,584
He won't get
the opportunity.

562
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:07,718
Was that necessary?

563
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:11,012
You're the terrorist.

564
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,514
You tell<i> me.</i>

565
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:16,393
Weapons secured, sir.
Excellent.

566
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:17,853
So is Engineering.

567
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,606
Well done.

568
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:25,819
Well, Major...

569
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:28,530
quite a prize we've taken.

570
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:31,658
The first Klingon bird-of-prey

571
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:35,036
ever to be captured
by Cardassia.

572
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,914
I think I just found
a bigger prize.

573
00:32:36,914 --> 00:32:39,999
It looks like we've got
the target priorities

574
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:43,712
of all Klingon raiders
in Cardassian space.

575
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:45,338
Ha!

576
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,633
I'll contact Central Command

577
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:50,761
and inform them of our success.

578
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:55,891
I think I'll request
my Legate title be reinstated,

579
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:58,310
effective immediately.

580
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,103
Get me Central Command.

581
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,397
No, on second thought...

582
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,566
this is too important for them.

583
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:06,652
I want to speak to the Chairman

584
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:10,656
of the Detapa Council himself
on a secure channel.

585
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:14,117
I can't do that from here, sir.
The communication terminals
on the Bridge are down.

586
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,369
But I could reroute it
to the Captain's quarters.

587
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:19,706
Good. Do so.
Then make the repairs.

588
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,208
I want this ship
fully operational

589
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,919
as soon as possible.

590
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,003
Aye, sir.

591
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:34,387
Ziyal, do you see
the phase compensator

592
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:36,348
in the backup plasma manifold?

593
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:37,933
What's it look like?

594
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:39,852
Perhaps I should
go help her.

595
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:41,812
Klingon technology is...

596
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:43,522
Odd. Good idea.

597
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,482
Hang on, Ziyal.
Help's on the way.

598
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:46,859
Understood.

599
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,363
You know something, Dukat.
These computer logs

600
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,866
are even more valuable
than I thought.

601
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:56,201
They contain status reports
from Klingon ships

602
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:58,745
and outposts throughout
Cardassian space.

603
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:01,122
With information like this,
Cardassia could launch

604
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:04,250
a major counterattack
against the Klingons.

605
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,460
They could,

606
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:09,756
but they won't.
Why not?

607
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:12,551
The Detapa Council
has something else in mind.

608
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:17,180
They've ordered me not
to engage the Klingons

609
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,017
in any further conflict.

610
00:34:20,017 --> 00:34:24,312
The Council is looking
for a diplomatic solution.

611
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:27,399
They've ordered me
to return to
Cardassia Prime

612
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:31,570
to resume my...
post as Military Advisor.

613
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,072
Well, I thought
that's what you wanted.

614
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,074
It<i> was.</i>

615
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:39,077
But what is the point
of being a military advisor

616
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,162
to a government
that won't fight?

617
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,748
Well, you can change
their minds.

618
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:44,583
Convince your fellow
Cardassians

619
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,209
to go on the offensive.

620
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:49,337
Nah, I'd be wasting my breath.

621
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,798
They wouldn't listen to me.

622
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:54,092
No one wants to fight.

623
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:58,764
There was a time

624
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:03,936
when the mere mention
of my race inspired fear.

625
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:07,564
And now...
we're a beaten people.

626
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:10,483
Afraid to fight back
because we don't want to lose

627
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,110
what little is left.

628
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,654
That's not the Cardassians
I know.

629
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,364
What Cardassians?

630
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,784
Don't you see, Major?

631
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:21,244
They're paralyzed.

632
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,622
They're beaten and defeated.

633
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:27,125
<i>I</i> am the only
Cardassian left,

634
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:32,089
and if no one else will stand
against the Klingons...

635
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:33,882
I will.

636
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,557
Look, Dukat,
I know you're angry,

637
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,684
but maybe you ought to think
about what you're proposing.

638
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:47,228
I mean, you can't go to war
against the whole
Klingon Empire

639
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,982
with one bird-of-prey.
Why not?

640
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:52,776
Your people fought
against us for 50 years

641
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:55,487
with much less sophisticated
weaponry than this,

642
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:58,073
and you beat us.
It's not the same.

643
00:35:58,073 --> 00:35:59,783
The Bajoran people
were united.

644
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:01,868
We were all fighting
for the same goal.

645
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,996
You and your crew would be
out there alone.

646
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:06,665
Maybe at first, but
perhaps our actions

647
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:09,459
would inspire others
to join the struggle.

648
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:11,920
It's not that easy, Dukat.

649
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,379
I know...

650
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,511
which is why I need you.

651
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,596
Me?
Who else?

652
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:24,099
You know how to organize
a resistance cell,

653
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:26,309
you're an expert
in terrorist tactics,

654
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:30,229
you have close ties
with Bajoran and
Federation officials,

655
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:32,231
and besides all that,
it would give you a chance

656
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:34,651
to do what you were meant to do.

657
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:36,611
No, thanks.

658
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,279
I've already got a job.

659
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,365
Oh! What do you mean?

660
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:42,742
On that space station?

661
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:46,830
We both know your talents
are being wasted there.

662
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,665
Coordinating docking assignments

663
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:50,876
and leading
training exercises.

664
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:53,670
On Deep Space 9, you're
nothing but a bureaucrat.

665
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,881
An administrator.

666
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:59,467
If you come with me,
you can be a soldier again.

667
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:03,638
Think about it, Major--
the chance to fight

668
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:07,184
against a superior foe
in a righteous cause.

669
00:37:07,184 --> 00:37:10,562
To protect a defeated
and broken people

670
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:12,939
from a cruel aggressor.

671
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:16,401
You know as well as I do
that if Cardassia falls,

672
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:19,029
Bajor is next.

673
00:37:19,029 --> 00:37:21,531
Help me stop the Klingons

674
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:24,492
before you become
their next target.

675
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:27,412
You're really serious
about this.

676
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:29,956
Absolutely!

677
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:35,170
Look, Major,
I'm not asking you to like me

678
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,881
or to be my friend.

679
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:40,633
I'm asking you to join me.

680
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:44,221
To fight at my side.

681
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:46,973
You know
what I'm doing is right,

682
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:50,309
and it's what you
want to do as well.

683
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:53,897
I know that our past
makes it difficult

684
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:56,108
for you to accept me
as an ally.

685
00:37:56,108 --> 00:37:58,526
I also know that every fiber
of your being

686
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,238
is telling you
to say no, no, no,

687
00:38:01,238 --> 00:38:05,117
but somewhere,
I know there's a "yes."

688
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:09,370
You need to listen
to that "yes."

689
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:13,250
Not for my sake,
not for Cardassia's,

690
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,293
not even for Bajor's...

691
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,672
but for your sake.

692
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:25,720
We've completed repairs
on the navigation system
and the cloaking device.

693
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:30,516
Good. We'll leave
as soon as you have it on line.

694
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:35,021
Think about it, Major.

695
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,985
Think about the possibilities.

696
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,747
Nerys.

697
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,293
I want to show
you something.

698
00:38:56,293 --> 00:38:58,211
Go ahead,
attack me.

699
00:38:58,211 --> 00:38:59,754
What are you
talking about?

700
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,589
It's okay.
I know what I'm doing.

701
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,049
Damar showed me
a good trick.

702
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,676
Try to stab me
with the knife.

703
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,771
Guess it wasn't
such a good trick.

704
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:20,025
The best way to
survive a knife fight

705
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:21,693
is to never get in one.

706
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:25,571
If I'm going to
help my father,

707
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,532
I have to be prepared
for anything.

708
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:30,160
Show me what you did.

709
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,913
Please. I know I have
a lot to learn.

710
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:36,457
I have been practicing
with the disruptor rifle,

711
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,793
but I need to know
how to defend myself

712
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,920
in hand-to-hand combat.

713
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,381
I was lucky not
to have to fight when
we boarded this ship.

714
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,258
I may not be
so lucky next time.

715
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:48,511
Chances are, you won't be.

716
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:51,056
Fighting the Klingons
is going to take more

717
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:54,475
than knowing how to fire a rifle
or use a knife.

718
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:57,270
You have to learn
to be ruthless.

719
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,356
You have to learn
to hate the Klingons...

720
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:01,566
even more
than you hated the Breen.

721
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:04,110
Whatever it takes,
I will do it,

722
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,779
but I'm going
to need your help.

723
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:09,908
You're right.

724
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:12,369
You do need my help.

725
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:18,250
I... am disappointed, Major.

726
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,876
But not surprised.

727
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,129
Tell me...

728
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,758
were you even tempted?

729
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:28,467
Not really.

730
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:32,847
Hmm. I thought
I was so eloquent.

731
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:35,058
You had your moments,

732
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:36,642
but the fact
of the matter is

733
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:38,644
I've already been
where you're going.

734
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:41,356
I've lived the life
you're choosing--

735
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:43,608
fighting hit-and-run,
always outgunned,

736
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:46,778
living on hate
and adrenaline...

737
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:49,447
it's not much of a life.

738
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,992
And it eats away at you
so that every day a
little bit of you dies.

739
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,161
Very inspiring, Major.

740
00:40:56,788 --> 00:41:00,250
But I don't have
any choice in this--

741
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:04,587
no more than you had
when you fought against us.

742
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:07,340
No, I don't suppose you do.

743
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,217
Hmm.

744
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:15,014
Well... all that's left
is for you to wish me luck.

745
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:17,642
That's not quite all.

746
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:19,560
There's still Ziyal.

747
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,229
What about her?

748
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:24,941
The life you're choosing
isn't for her.

749
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:26,525
She deserves better.

750
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,653
She deserves to be
with her father.

751
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:30,863
You taught me that.

752
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,698
I love her.

753
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:34,742
I know you do,

754
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,953
and that's why you've got
to let her go.

755
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:39,831
Go? Where?

756
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:43,042
She's not welcome
on Cardassia<i> or</i> Bajor.

757
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:46,379
<i>This</i> is the only place
she belongs.

758
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:49,090
That's not true.

759
00:41:51,301 --> 00:41:53,886
She could come
to Deep Space 9 with me.

760
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,355
Are you serious?

761
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:06,149
She's a remarkable
young woman.

762
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:08,109
I'll make sure she's okay.

763
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:10,236
Why?

764
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,780
Why do you care so much?

765
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:18,161
Because she reminds me
of myself...

766
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:23,500
and I don't want her to go
through what I went through...

767
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,170
and neither do you.

768
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:38,473
Captain, a Klingon bird-of-prey
just de-cloaked off the station.

769
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:39,682
On screen.

770
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:43,811
O'BRIEN:
They're hailing us.

771
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,230
Let's find out
what they want.

772
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,232
O'BRIEN:
Sir, it's Gul Dukat.

773
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:50,276
On a Klingon ship?

774
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,487
He's asking permission
to dock.

775
00:42:57,075 --> 00:43:01,204
When this is all over,
I'll come back for you.

776
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:02,955
I promise you that.

777
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,832
I know you will.

778
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:07,710
Major...

779
00:43:09,546 --> 00:43:11,714
I'll take
good care of her.

780
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,258
I know.

781
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:15,718
Well, Major, it appears

782
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:17,845
that, whether you
like it or not,

783
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:21,682
our lives have become
deeply intertwined.

784
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:24,977
That really pleases you,
doesn't it?

785
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:26,812
Pleases me?

786
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:30,316
Major, it gives me
reason to live.

787
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:39,867
(<i> sighing</i> )

788
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:51,379
Come. I'll show you
to your quarters.

789
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:53,089
Welcome back, Major.

790
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:57,135
Odo, this
is Tora Ziyal.
Gul Dukat's daughter.

791
00:43:57,135 --> 00:43:59,512
She going to be living here
on the station with us--

792
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:00,721
for a while.

793
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,265
Ah.

794
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:05,643
I'll tell you
all about it.

795
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:10,440
I certainly hope so.
