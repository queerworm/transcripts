1
00:00:06,074 --> 00:00:07,840
Anything yet?

2
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:08,939
Should be here any minute.

3
00:00:08,981 --> 00:00:10,041
Running a little late.

4
00:00:10,084 --> 00:00:12,352
This is no way to start
a relationship.

5
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:14,954
Hi, Ezri.

6
00:00:16,567 --> 00:00:18,401
So, how's Odo?

7
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:21,413
Oh, his body shows no signs
of the changeling disease.

8
00:00:21,447 --> 00:00:22,677
I believe he's cured.

9
00:00:22,717 --> 00:00:24,654
Oh, that's great.

10
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:28,865
Yes, in fact, um...

11
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,600
I'm going to discharge
him this afternoon.

12
00:00:31,641 --> 00:00:33,909
That's... that's really great.

13
00:00:33,946 --> 00:00:34,937
Yeah.

14
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:41,821
I don't get it.

15
00:00:41,867 --> 00:00:44,203
He's interested,
she's interested.

16
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,766
What's the problem?

17
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,750
He is an overgrown child

18
00:00:48,785 --> 00:00:52,318
and she is very... confused.

19
00:00:53,397 --> 00:00:54,627
It could still work.

20
00:00:56,104 --> 00:00:57,972
She's here.

21
00:01:00,516 --> 00:01:02,510
On screen.

22
00:01:07,232 --> 00:01:08,496
I didn't know we were

23
00:01:08,536 --> 00:01:10,632
getting another
Defiant-class ship.

24
00:01:10,675 --> 00:01:13,147
That's what happens
when you miss staff meetings.

25
00:01:13,182 --> 00:01:15,950
Looks... just like her.

26
00:01:15,988 --> 00:01:18,324
Let's hope she fights like her.

27
00:01:24,411 --> 00:01:27,179
All hands, attention to orders.

28
00:01:27,218 --> 00:01:30,317
From Starfleet Headquarters,
Office of the Admiralty

29
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:32,831
to Captain Benjamin L. Sisko.

30
00:01:32,866 --> 00:01:35,704
As of this date,
you are requested and required

31
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,768
to take command
of USS <i>Sao Paulo.</i>

32
00:01:37,812 --> 00:01:43,259
Signed, Vice Admiral William
J. Ross, Stardate 52861.3.

33
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,363
Computer, transfer
all command codes

34
00:01:46,468 --> 00:01:47,367
to Captain Sisko.

35
00:01:47,471 --> 00:01:49,670
Command codes transferred.

36
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:50,973
I relieve you, sir.

37
00:01:51,013 --> 00:01:52,277
I stand relieved.

38
00:01:52,316 --> 00:01:54,811
She's all yours, Ben.
You've a fine ship here.

39
00:01:54,856 --> 00:01:58,457
She has some...
big shoes to fill.

40
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:04,745
I hate the carpet.
I do.

41
00:02:04,782 --> 00:02:06,342
Oh, uh, by the way

42
00:02:06,453 --> 00:02:08,823
there's, uh, something else
on that padd

43
00:02:08,859 --> 00:02:10,351
that might interest you.

44
00:02:12,836 --> 00:02:15,308
Special Dispensation

45
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,371
from the Chief
of Starfleet Operations

46
00:02:17,415 --> 00:02:21,722
to change the name
from <i>Sao Paulo</i>

47
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:22,819
to <i>Defiant.</i>

48
00:02:34,526 --> 00:02:36,360
The Breen are going
to be in for a surprise

49
00:02:36,398 --> 00:02:38,426
when they train their
energy-dampening weapons

50
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:39,438
on this beauty, huh?

51
00:02:39,472 --> 00:02:40,600
The shield generators

52
00:02:40,642 --> 00:02:42,442
have been completely
reconfigured.

53
00:02:42,547 --> 00:02:44,541
Let's go look.

54
00:02:44,585 --> 00:02:45,576
You know what?

55
00:02:45,622 --> 00:02:47,559
I, uh, want to check out
my Sick Bay.

56
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,803
Well, I'll let you two
get acquainted.

57
00:03:09,617 --> 00:03:11,851
Hello, ship.

58
00:03:18,841 --> 00:03:20,471
Cardassia.

59
00:03:20,578 --> 00:03:24,179
It's as beautiful as I remember.

60
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:26,921
It won't be beautiful to my eyes
until the Dominion is gone.

61
00:03:26,962 --> 00:03:27,988
Orbital Traffic Control

62
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:29,729
is asking
for our security clearance.

63
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:31,170
I'll handle it.

64
00:03:31,206 --> 00:03:32,836
We're taking a big risk
coming here.

65
00:03:32,877 --> 00:03:33,868
I hope it's worth it.

66
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,281
Gul Revok and Legate Goris

67
00:03:35,317 --> 00:03:38,051
are ready to bring their troops
over to our side.

68
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,061
That's over
a half a million men.

69
00:03:40,096 --> 00:03:42,534
If we can convince Gul Seltan
to join us as well

70
00:03:42,636 --> 00:03:43,662
that's another 100,000.

71
00:03:43,705 --> 00:03:45,106
I think that is
worth the risk.

72
00:03:45,143 --> 00:03:47,239
And you're sure
you want me around?

73
00:03:47,281 --> 00:03:48,773
Before they join us,
they'll want assurances

74
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:50,152
that the Federation
will support them.

75
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:52,423
We've been cleared
for standard orbit.

76
00:03:52,461 --> 00:03:53,725
Do you have transport
coordinates?

77
00:03:53,764 --> 00:03:55,894
Yes. Transporter room
is standing by.

78
00:03:55,937 --> 00:03:57,429
Then the Bridge is yours,
Seskal.

79
00:03:59,212 --> 00:04:00,203
Good luck.

80
00:04:16,658 --> 00:04:17,557
Is that all of them?

81
00:04:17,661 --> 00:04:18,560
Yes, sir.

82
00:04:18,663 --> 00:04:20,293
Check the other side
of the cave!

83
00:04:20,334 --> 00:04:22,271
Inform the First that we have
killed all the traitors.

84
00:04:22,306 --> 00:04:23,798
How did they know?

85
00:04:23,842 --> 00:04:24,833
Well, well, well.

86
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:27,113
What do we have here?

87
00:04:27,152 --> 00:04:29,055
I told you I could
lure them here for you.

88
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,152
Gul Revok.

89
00:04:31,195 --> 00:04:33,189
He betrayed us.

90
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:35,569
Kira to Seskal.
Get us out of here.

91
00:04:35,606 --> 00:04:37,075
We're under attack!

92
00:04:38,881 --> 00:04:40,009
I can't lower the shields!

93
00:04:41,121 --> 00:04:43,525
Lock the disruptors
and return fire!

94
00:04:43,561 --> 00:04:45,999
Transfer the auxiliary
power to...

95
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:54,619
Seskal?

96
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,295
Seskal?

97
00:06:55,012 --> 00:06:56,311
Seskal?

98
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:57,817
Seskal, do you read me?

99
00:06:57,852 --> 00:07:00,051
I don't think
they're up there anymore.

100
00:07:00,092 --> 00:07:01,061
We've got to get out of here.

101
00:07:01,095 --> 00:07:02,496
No.

102
00:07:02,532 --> 00:07:05,266
Damar, do you know
any place we can go?

103
00:07:05,373 --> 00:07:06,501
Everyone I know on Cardassia

104
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:08,011
has either been
arrested or killed.

105
00:07:08,046 --> 00:07:09,949
I think I know someone
who might take us in.

106
00:07:09,984 --> 00:07:11,648
That is, if we can
get to the capital.

107
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:13,158
Well, we can't stay here.

108
00:07:21,915 --> 00:07:24,319
If you don't mind hiding
in a basement

109
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:27,123
then I guess I don't mind
having you down here.

110
00:07:29,836 --> 00:07:33,608
I don't hear from you for years

111
00:07:33,646 --> 00:07:37,349
and then you show up
on my doorstep

112
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:39,360
with these people.

113
00:07:39,428 --> 00:07:41,490
I do apologize for the intrusion

114
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:44,701
but you're the only person
on Cardassia I could trust.

115
00:07:44,741 --> 00:07:48,844
Well, don't blame me if you
don't have any friends left.

116
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,859
Well, now, where's
that light switch?

117
00:07:52,895 --> 00:07:55,561
It's smaller than I remember.

118
00:07:55,603 --> 00:07:57,403
I grew up in this house.

119
00:07:57,475 --> 00:07:58,876
Did I mention that?

120
00:07:58,911 --> 00:07:59,880
I thought you said

121
00:07:59,914 --> 00:08:01,213
Enabran Tain used to live here.

122
00:08:01,251 --> 00:08:03,347
Tain was Garak's father.

123
00:08:03,456 --> 00:08:05,655
He was unable
to acknowledge it publicly

124
00:08:05,696 --> 00:08:08,066
because he was head
of the Obsidian Order.

125
00:08:08,102 --> 00:08:12,307
Mila was our housekeeper
and most trusted confidante.

126
00:08:12,346 --> 00:08:14,682
I was never much of a cook

127
00:08:14,719 --> 00:08:16,815
but I knew how to keep a secret.

128
00:08:16,858 --> 00:08:18,852
We have to contact the
other resistance cells

129
00:08:18,897 --> 00:08:20,025
and warn them about Revok.

130
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:22,162
Is there any way
you can get us a com unit?

131
00:08:22,205 --> 00:08:24,643
If it's not too much
of an imposition.

132
00:08:24,678 --> 00:08:27,276
You shouldn't be involved
in this.

133
00:08:27,318 --> 00:08:29,688
We're attempting
to free our people.

134
00:08:29,724 --> 00:08:31,627
Do you want to live
under the Dominion

135
00:08:31,663 --> 00:08:32,996
for the rest of your life?

136
00:08:35,072 --> 00:08:36,736
I'm an old woman.

137
00:08:36,777 --> 00:08:40,149
I'm long past caring
about such things.

138
00:08:40,185 --> 00:08:43,387
But I'll get you your com unit.

139
00:08:43,427 --> 00:08:44,453
Mila...

140
00:08:44,563 --> 00:08:46,329
thank you.

141
00:08:46,368 --> 00:08:48,704
I promise we won't stay long.

142
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,316
Well, you might as well
make yourselves useful.

143
00:08:53,353 --> 00:08:56,623
This place hasn't
been cleaned in years.

144
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:04,939
You heard the lady.

145
00:09:08,492 --> 00:09:11,432
The glamour of being
a revolutionary, hmm?

146
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:18,609
Well, everything
checks out fine.

147
00:09:18,651 --> 00:09:20,485
I'm certifying you
fit for duty.

148
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,652
Finally.
Last time I spoke

149
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,964
with Kira, she wanted to know
when I'd be rejoining her.

150
00:09:26,071 --> 00:09:27,735
Odo, um...

151
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,905
there is something
you need to know.

152
00:09:29,947 --> 00:09:31,348
When I first discovered

153
00:09:31,385 --> 00:09:35,054
that you had become infected
with the morphogenic virus

154
00:09:35,095 --> 00:09:37,693
I assumed you'd contracted it
from the Founders.

155
00:09:39,171 --> 00:09:40,663
Didn't I?

156
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:42,771
No.

157
00:09:42,814 --> 00:09:44,409
The fact is, it was you

158
00:09:44,452 --> 00:09:47,016
who transmitted
the disease to them.

159
00:09:50,702 --> 00:09:52,570
But...

160
00:09:54,712 --> 00:09:56,774
how did I get it?

161
00:09:56,817 --> 00:09:59,449
You were deliberately infected.

162
00:09:59,491 --> 00:10:01,257
By whom?

163
00:10:01,296 --> 00:10:03,324
Section 31.

164
00:10:03,368 --> 00:10:04,998
They used you as a carrier

165
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:08,537
hoping you would pass on
the disease to the Founders.

166
00:10:08,581 --> 00:10:10,780
I'm sure you were never meant
to develop symptoms, but...

167
00:10:10,821 --> 00:10:13,589
I don't care whether
they meant to kill me or not.

168
00:10:13,627 --> 00:10:18,629
The reality is, the Federation
set out to destroy my people.

169
00:10:18,707 --> 00:10:21,202
Section 31 aren't part
of the Federation.

170
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:22,614
They're a rogue organization...

171
00:10:22,651 --> 00:10:25,557
Don't split hairs
with me, Doctor.

172
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:32,132
They used me as an instrument
to try to commit genocide.

173
00:10:32,176 --> 00:10:34,444
Now, we may be at war
with the Founders

174
00:10:34,482 --> 00:10:36,646
but that's no excuse.

175
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:40,629
I completely agree.

176
00:10:40,664 --> 00:10:45,335
And what does Starfleet
intend to do about it?

177
00:10:45,377 --> 00:10:46,710
The Federation Council

178
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:49,185
considered giving
the Founders the cure.

179
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,088
Then they decided against it.

180
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,221
Then they're abetting genocide.

181
00:10:53,264 --> 00:10:55,828
I don't condone
what Section 31 did

182
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,105
but the Founders
started this war, not us.

183
00:10:58,143 --> 00:11:01,676
Giving them the cure
would strengthen their hand...

184
00:11:01,719 --> 00:11:04,385
and we can't do that.

185
00:11:04,426 --> 00:11:05,986
Not when there are still

186
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,264
millions of men and women
out there

187
00:11:08,303 --> 00:11:10,935
putting their lives
on the line every day.

188
00:11:10,977 --> 00:11:12,914
Well, I can see
there's no use protesting.

189
00:11:12,948 --> 00:11:14,612
The decision's been made.

190
00:11:14,653 --> 00:11:18,652
Odo, I wish I didn't
have to say this

191
00:11:18,696 --> 00:11:20,063
but I need to know

192
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,402
you're not going to take
matters into your own hands.

193
00:11:26,216 --> 00:11:28,745
You have my word.

194
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:31,328
That's all I needed to hear.

195
00:11:31,362 --> 00:11:33,766
Interesting, isn't it?

196
00:11:33,835 --> 00:11:37,538
The Federation claims
to abhor Section 31's

197
00:11:37,578 --> 00:11:39,948
tactics, but when they need
their dirty work done

198
00:11:39,985 --> 00:11:41,922
they look the other way.

199
00:11:41,956 --> 00:11:45,830
It's a tidy little arrangement,
wouldn't you say?

200
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,031
Go ahead.
What have you got to lose?

201
00:11:58,065 --> 00:11:59,466
Our jobs.

202
00:11:59,502 --> 00:12:00,869
Let's do it.

203
00:12:00,906 --> 00:12:03,140
At this point, I don't
care if he fires me.

204
00:12:03,178 --> 00:12:04,408
That's the spirit.

205
00:12:04,448 --> 00:12:06,578
Remember, ask for ten percent

206
00:12:06,621 --> 00:12:07,885
but settle for 15.

207
00:12:07,924 --> 00:12:09,952
Okay.

208
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:15,935
Quark...

209
00:12:15,979 --> 00:12:17,448
we have something to say.

210
00:12:17,482 --> 00:12:18,610
Then say it.

211
00:12:18,652 --> 00:12:19,814
We don't think we should have

212
00:12:19,922 --> 00:12:21,482
to give you 20 percent
of our tips.

213
00:12:21,527 --> 00:12:23,623
Mm-hmm.

214
00:12:23,665 --> 00:12:27,163
We think ten percent
is more than fair

215
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:30,182
and we're not going back to
work until this is settled.

216
00:12:30,215 --> 00:12:31,445
Ten percent?

217
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:35,393
Quark, there's an incoming
transmission from Ferenginar!

218
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:37,765
It's the Grand Nagus!

219
00:12:38,971 --> 00:12:40,737
I'll take it in the back room.

220
00:12:40,776 --> 00:12:41,938
Well?

221
00:12:42,747 --> 00:12:43,977
I'll think about it.

222
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,549
What did he say?

223
00:12:47,594 --> 00:12:49,565
He's going to think about it.

224
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:03,263
Is that you?

225
00:13:03,305 --> 00:13:04,604
It's me.

226
00:13:04,642 --> 00:13:06,772
I can barely see you.

227
00:13:06,815 --> 00:13:08,877
It's the static.

228
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,446
Sorry about the static.

229
00:13:10,491 --> 00:13:11,721
It's raining here.

230
00:13:11,761 --> 00:13:14,667
It's always raining there.

231
00:13:14,701 --> 00:13:16,331
Not this kind of rain.

232
00:13:16,439 --> 00:13:18,877
...an accident
at the power plant.

233
00:13:18,912 --> 00:13:21,350
The contractor used

234
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:25,852
substandard relays,
the greedy bastard.

235
00:13:25,897 --> 00:13:31,572
There's a toxic electrostatic
cloud hanging over the city.

236
00:13:31,613 --> 00:13:33,584
What a frigging mess.

237
00:13:33,618 --> 00:13:37,721
So, what do I owe the pleasure?

238
00:13:37,761 --> 00:13:39,128
The pressure?

239
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,034
That's an ungrateful thing
to say.

240
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,369
I'm not pressuring you.

241
00:13:42,407 --> 00:13:46,315
No..."the pleasure."

242
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,287
You're not making any sense.

243
00:13:48,322 --> 00:13:50,316
Now shut up and listen.

244
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,889
I'm retiring.

245
00:13:52,935 --> 00:13:55,430
Your mother and I

246
00:13:55,474 --> 00:14:00,043
are moving to Risa
to enjoy our old age

247
00:14:00,086 --> 00:14:05,157
and do a lot of...,
if you know what I mean.

248
00:14:06,737 --> 00:14:08,401
Good for you...

249
00:14:08,507 --> 00:14:09,601
I guess.

250
00:14:09,644 --> 00:14:12,880
I'll be coming to Deep Space 9

251
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,947
to name my successor.

252
00:14:14,992 --> 00:14:16,427
Why here?

253
00:14:16,528 --> 00:14:18,226
Why do you think?

254
00:14:18,267 --> 00:14:19,965
To get away from the rain?

255
00:14:20,005 --> 00:14:21,805
No, my boy.

256
00:14:21,843 --> 00:14:24,840
I've chosen you to succeed me.

257
00:14:24,884 --> 00:14:30,229
You're going to be
the new Grand Nagus.

258
00:14:30,264 --> 00:14:32,132
Congratulations...

259
00:14:51,553 --> 00:14:52,647
Oh, I'm sorry.

260
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:55,663
I'm sorry.

261
00:14:57,234 --> 00:14:58,203
I'm sorry.

262
00:14:58,237 --> 00:14:59,206
I nearly... Hi.

263
00:14:59,239 --> 00:15:01,176
Hi.

264
00:15:01,212 --> 00:15:02,306
Your lunch?

265
00:15:02,347 --> 00:15:03,977
Uh, it's that time.

266
00:15:04,018 --> 00:15:05,648
Oh.

267
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,854
This is ridiculous.

268
00:15:07,895 --> 00:15:09,490
I know.

269
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:10,502
I have a confession...

270
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:12,005
Listen, I've been
meaning to tell you...

271
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:13,008
You go first.

272
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:14,011
No, that's all right.

273
00:15:14,044 --> 00:15:16,516
No, really, Julian.
You go first.

274
00:15:16,551 --> 00:15:18,215
Okay.

275
00:15:19,826 --> 00:15:22,424
You know how much
I value our friendship.

276
00:15:22,467 --> 00:15:27,242
Well... lately,
I've been wondering

277
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,016
if... maybe we could be...

278
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,219
Something more?

279
00:15:33,261 --> 00:15:34,230
Yes.

280
00:15:34,263 --> 00:15:35,391
Exactly.

281
00:15:35,433 --> 00:15:36,561
I've been wondering
the same thing.

282
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:37,730
Oh, I thought it was just me.

283
00:15:37,773 --> 00:15:38,742
Me, too.

284
00:15:38,776 --> 00:15:40,211
That's why I've been
so awkward around you.

285
00:15:40,246 --> 00:15:41,876
I've been trying to tell
you, but every time I...

286
00:15:41,917 --> 00:15:42,886
It just...

287
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:43,910
I couldn't get the words...

288
00:15:43,956 --> 00:15:45,220
I know, what is that?

289
00:15:45,259 --> 00:15:46,421
I don't...

290
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:48,795
I mean, I'm not
usually like this.

291
00:15:48,835 --> 00:15:49,997
If, if I find
somebody attractive

292
00:15:50,038 --> 00:15:52,134
I just, I just,
I just tell them

293
00:15:52,177 --> 00:15:55,345
and I don't play
these ridiculous games.

294
00:15:55,385 --> 00:15:56,649
Neither do I.

295
00:16:01,268 --> 00:16:03,467
You know...

296
00:16:03,506 --> 00:16:05,670
why we might be holding back?

297
00:16:05,712 --> 00:16:07,444
The friendship.

298
00:16:07,484 --> 00:16:10,252
You're right.

299
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:11,886
Why jeopardize our friendship

300
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,595
uh, by trying to turn this
into something else?

301
00:16:14,635 --> 00:16:17,005
I've made that mistake before.

302
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,477
Yes, and once you
cross the line...

303
00:16:18,512 --> 00:16:19,742
You can never go back.

304
00:16:19,782 --> 00:16:23,622
And if it doesn't work out,
you can never be friends again.

305
00:16:23,725 --> 00:16:26,323
I can't bear the thought
of losing you as a friend.

306
00:16:26,366 --> 00:16:27,767
Neither can I.

307
00:16:32,749 --> 00:16:35,085
So that's that.

308
00:16:35,122 --> 00:16:37,617
We figured it out.

309
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,936
You know, it takes
a certain maturity

310
00:16:41,973 --> 00:16:45,072
to not be swept away
by the romantic fantasy.

311
00:16:45,115 --> 00:16:46,209
That's right.

312
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,241
Why let, uh...

313
00:16:47,286 --> 00:16:49,485
physical attraction
overcome good sense?

314
00:16:49,526 --> 00:16:51,497
Chemistry isn't everything.

315
00:16:51,531 --> 00:16:52,625
Absolutely not.

316
00:16:52,668 --> 00:16:53,637
We're adults.

317
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,573
I think we should be
proud of ourselves.

318
00:16:55,608 --> 00:16:56,838
So do I.

319
00:16:56,878 --> 00:16:58,644
I feel much better.

320
00:16:58,683 --> 00:16:59,709
Friends?

321
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:01,983
Friends.

322
00:17:02,025 --> 00:17:04,897
Just think, this time next week

323
00:17:04,932 --> 00:17:07,666
I'll be living
in the Nagal residence.

324
00:17:07,707 --> 00:17:10,179
They say even
the waste extraction fixtures

325
00:17:10,213 --> 00:17:11,648
are plated with latinum.

326
00:17:11,683 --> 00:17:12,845
That's right!

327
00:17:13,889 --> 00:17:15,826
Oh, oh, the first thing
I'm going to do

328
00:17:15,861 --> 00:17:18,994
is rip them out and replace them
with solid latinum fixtures.

329
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,540
That's a little indulgent,
don't you think?

330
00:17:22,578 --> 00:17:24,674
Of course.
That's the point.

331
00:17:24,717 --> 00:17:28,250
A Nagus has to lead by example.

332
00:17:28,293 --> 00:17:31,631
My greed has to be
a shining light to everyone

333
00:17:31,668 --> 00:17:34,665
a testament
to the rewards of avarice.

334
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,944
Now, I hope you're
not going to be lonely

335
00:17:36,982 --> 00:17:40,617
in that great big
Nagal residence.

336
00:17:40,658 --> 00:17:42,720
I've got a room
picked out for you

337
00:17:42,764 --> 00:17:44,097
already, my dear

338
00:17:44,134 --> 00:17:46,936
with a view
of the Tower of Commerce

339
00:17:46,974 --> 00:17:51,783
and, uh, there'll be
a place for my dear brother

340
00:17:51,887 --> 00:17:52,878
my brave nephew

341
00:17:52,924 --> 00:17:54,554
and my lovely sister-in-law.

342
00:17:54,595 --> 00:17:56,064
Liquidator Brunt!

343
00:17:56,098 --> 00:17:58,366
- Uh, not him.
- Uh-uh.

344
00:17:58,405 --> 00:18:00,205
No. He's here.

345
00:18:08,464 --> 00:18:10,902
What brings you here
this time, Brunt?

346
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:17,050
Ferenginar is rife with rumors.

347
00:18:17,087 --> 00:18:20,323
They say the Grand Nagus
is coming to DS9

348
00:18:20,362 --> 00:18:22,800
to name his successor.

349
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:27,539
For once, the rumors...
are right.

350
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,587
I see.

351
00:18:35,434 --> 00:18:40,938
A thousand...
congratulations, my Nagus.

352
00:18:42,452 --> 00:18:44,423
He's not Nagus yet.

353
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:47,191
It's never too early
to suck up to the boss.

354
00:18:47,231 --> 00:18:50,535
I think I'm going
to like being Nagus.

355
00:18:50,573 --> 00:18:51,803
Don't stop.

356
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:55,750
...and thanks to the heroic
efforts of Gul Revok

357
00:18:55,786 --> 00:19:00,127
Damar was lured to Cardassia
to meet with five other traitors

358
00:19:00,164 --> 00:19:02,260
but his coconspirators
were killed

359
00:19:02,304 --> 00:19:05,768
before they could begin plotting
against the people of Cardassia

360
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:08,786
and Damar himself was killed

361
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,984
while trying to penetrate
our defense perimeters

362
00:19:11,027 --> 00:19:13,865
in a stolen Dominion vessel.

363
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,871
At least they're not looking
for us anymore.

364
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,306
...just hours ago

365
00:19:17,343 --> 00:19:20,181
acting on information obtained
by our intelligence operatives

366
00:19:20,216 --> 00:19:22,688
our brave troops began

367
00:19:22,723 --> 00:19:26,665
a coordinated assault
on Damar's terrorist bases.

368
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:32,614
From Atbar Prime to Regulak IV,
from Simperia to Quinor VII

369
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:37,025
our forces eliminated
a total of 18 rebel bases.

370
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,427
With the rebellion crushed...

371
00:19:38,465 --> 00:19:40,129
All 18?

372
00:19:40,168 --> 00:19:44,305
...nothing can impede
our march to final victory.

373
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:50,962
Truly, this is a great day
for the Dominion.

374
00:19:52,467 --> 00:19:55,133
How could they have compromised
our entire organization?

375
00:19:55,174 --> 00:19:56,302
We took every precaution

376
00:19:56,344 --> 00:19:57,779
encrypted every transmission,
screened...

377
00:19:57,814 --> 00:19:59,808
It doesn't matter
how they did it.

378
00:19:59,853 --> 00:20:01,254
It's done.

379
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:07,601
Now we've got to find
a way off Cardassia.

380
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,340
Garak, can we use that thing
to contact the Federation?

381
00:20:10,381 --> 00:20:12,649
With a signal that strong,
the Dominion would trace

382
00:20:12,686 --> 00:20:14,316
our location
in a matter of seconds.

383
00:20:14,357 --> 00:20:17,456
Well, we've got to do something.

384
00:20:17,499 --> 00:20:20,371
We are not spending
the rest of this war

385
00:20:20,407 --> 00:20:22,139
in this cellar, are we?

386
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:30,662
Are we?

387
00:20:41,862 --> 00:20:43,833
Financial advisor...

388
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,359
I don't know.

389
00:20:45,404 --> 00:20:47,774
I do have lots of connections
on Ferenginar.

390
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,279
I don't need your connections.

391
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:51,047
As Nagus, people
will be lining up

392
00:20:51,086 --> 00:20:52,612
to do business with me.

393
00:20:52,657 --> 00:20:55,425
You missed a spot.

394
00:20:55,464 --> 00:20:56,797
Oh.

395
00:20:56,834 --> 00:20:59,636
I'm sure there must
be something I can do

396
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,612
to make you change your mind.

397
00:21:01,646 --> 00:21:02,842
Possibly.

398
00:21:02,883 --> 00:21:07,088
Would... 40 bricks

399
00:21:07,161 --> 00:21:09,531
of gold-pressed latinum
do the trick?

400
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:11,093
No, but 70 would.

401
00:21:11,205 --> 00:21:12,070
Fifty.

402
00:21:12,107 --> 00:21:12,665
Sixty.

403
00:21:12,709 --> 00:21:13,369
Done.

404
00:21:15,415 --> 00:21:17,409
If you'll sign this.

405
00:21:17,455 --> 00:21:18,424
What is it?

406
00:21:18,457 --> 00:21:19,356
A receipt.

407
00:21:19,393 --> 00:21:20,362
For a bribe?

408
00:21:20,395 --> 00:21:23,061
Oh, surely you're aware

409
00:21:23,103 --> 00:21:24,515
of the new regulation
making all bribes

410
00:21:24,648 --> 00:21:25,479
tax-deductible.

411
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:26,509
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

412
00:21:26,553 --> 00:21:29,425
Did you just use the T-word?

413
00:21:29,461 --> 00:21:30,794
You mean "tax"?

414
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:34,830
Are you telling me there are...
Ts on Ferenginar?

415
00:21:34,874 --> 00:21:36,777
You haven't been keeping up

416
00:21:36,814 --> 00:21:39,150
with the latest reforms,
have you?

417
00:21:39,186 --> 00:21:40,655
Zek instituted

418
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,687
progressive income tax
three months ago.

419
00:21:43,732 --> 00:21:45,167
You call that a reform?

420
00:21:45,202 --> 00:21:48,700
Taxes go against the very spirit
of free enterprise.

421
00:21:48,745 --> 00:21:51,240
That's why they call it "free."

422
00:21:51,284 --> 00:21:53,552
The government needed revenues

423
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:56,062
to fund
the new social programs...

424
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:59,070
wage subsidies for the poor

425
00:21:59,104 --> 00:22:00,870
retirement benefits
for the aged

426
00:22:00,909 --> 00:22:01,935
health care for...

427
00:22:01,979 --> 00:22:03,005
Stop, stop, stop.

428
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:07,448
I had no idea
things had gotten so bad.

429
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:10,729
This is all Moogie's fault.

430
00:22:10,768 --> 00:22:14,072
She's been polluting Zek's mind
with notions of equality

431
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,579
and compassion.

432
00:22:15,614 --> 00:22:18,486
Whatever happened
to survival of the fittest?

433
00:22:18,521 --> 00:22:20,515
Whatever happened
to the rich getting richer

434
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,586
and the poor getting poorer?

435
00:22:21,629 --> 00:22:25,264
Whatever happened
to pure, unadulterated...

436
00:22:25,306 --> 00:22:26,866
- Greed.
- Greed?

437
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:30,443
Well, things change.

438
00:22:30,486 --> 00:22:32,548
And they're going
to change back.

439
00:22:37,538 --> 00:22:39,202
The first thing I'm going to do

440
00:22:39,242 --> 00:22:41,270
is eliminate
these so-called reforms

441
00:22:41,314 --> 00:22:44,014
before Ferenginar ends
up looking like a...

442
00:22:44,054 --> 00:22:45,614
Federation planet.

443
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:46,992
Oh, I'm not sure

444
00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:49,399
the Congress of Economic
Advisors will approve.

445
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:52,432
I don't care who they are
or what they are.

446
00:22:52,476 --> 00:22:54,846
As Nagus, I can do what I want.

447
00:22:54,882 --> 00:22:56,249
Not anymore.

448
00:22:56,287 --> 00:22:59,420
All regulations
proposed by the Nagus

449
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,794
have to be ratified

450
00:23:00,832 --> 00:23:03,361
by the Congress
before they become law.

451
00:23:03,405 --> 00:23:05,069
Oh, you'll still be
a powerful man.

452
00:23:05,109 --> 00:23:07,308
I wouldn't be sucking up
to you otherwise.

453
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:14,665
Blessed Exchequer, forgive us.

454
00:23:14,701 --> 00:23:19,236
Your children
have gone astray.

455
00:23:27,701 --> 00:23:30,937
If only they could see you now.

456
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:32,343
Who?

457
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,146
The people in the streets.

458
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:40,496
Everyone's talking
about Damar and his rebels.

459
00:23:40,534 --> 00:23:41,969
What are they saying?

460
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:45,469
How stupid we were for walking
into a Dominion trap?

461
00:23:45,514 --> 00:23:47,212
How arrogant we were

462
00:23:47,252 --> 00:23:49,690
to think we could beat them
in the first place?

463
00:23:49,725 --> 00:23:52,597
How glad they are
that we're all dead?

464
00:23:52,633 --> 00:23:55,037
Actually, they don't
really believe you are dead.

465
00:23:55,072 --> 00:23:56,667
Oh, you should
hear the stories.

466
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:59,114
"Damar is alive.

467
00:23:59,149 --> 00:24:02,248
"My cousin saw him
on Kelvas Prime."

468
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:04,455
"He faked his own death."

469
00:24:04,497 --> 00:24:08,838
"He is plotting a new offensive

470
00:24:08,874 --> 00:24:10,902
from his secret
mountain hideaway."

471
00:24:10,947 --> 00:24:14,217
You never told me you had
a secret mountain hideaway.

472
00:24:14,255 --> 00:24:16,591
I was going to surprise you.

473
00:24:16,628 --> 00:24:19,534
I wonder why they refuse
to believe you're dead.

474
00:24:19,569 --> 00:24:22,133
Oh, they've been lied to
so often.

475
00:24:22,176 --> 00:24:25,207
They don't trust anything
the Dominion says.

476
00:24:27,021 --> 00:24:28,787
No, what if it's more than that?

477
00:24:28,826 --> 00:24:30,261
What if we had
more of an impact

478
00:24:30,297 --> 00:24:32,131
than we realized?

479
00:24:32,169 --> 00:24:34,539
What if we turned you
into a legend?

480
00:24:36,513 --> 00:24:37,607
Some legend.

481
00:24:37,649 --> 00:24:39,084
Don't you see?

482
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,250
The people want
to believe in you.

483
00:24:41,292 --> 00:24:42,488
We can use that.

484
00:24:42,528 --> 00:24:44,830
Yes, the organized resistance
is gone

485
00:24:44,935 --> 00:24:49,002
but there's an entire
civilian population out there

486
00:24:49,046 --> 00:24:51,746
that is fed up with living
under the occupation

487
00:24:51,786 --> 00:24:54,418
and if Damar,
the man they couldn't kill

488
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:56,089
tells the people of Cardassia

489
00:24:56,131 --> 00:24:57,532
to rise up
against the Dominion...

490
00:24:57,567 --> 00:25:00,973
Then we might have
a revolution on our hands.

491
00:25:02,647 --> 00:25:04,481
Or you might really
get yourselves killed.

492
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:07,253
Anything's better
than rotting in this cellar.

493
00:25:09,198 --> 00:25:10,497
How do we begin?

494
00:25:13,442 --> 00:25:16,040
Where's the closest
Jem'Hadar barracks?

495
00:25:20,026 --> 00:25:22,260
Come in.

496
00:25:25,674 --> 00:25:30,642
Allow me to present Gul...
no, I'm sorry... Legate Broca

497
00:25:30,687 --> 00:25:33,125
the new leader
of the Cardassian Union.

498
00:25:37,872 --> 00:25:41,837
I serve the Founders
in all things.

499
00:25:41,882 --> 00:25:44,411
Your service is noted.

500
00:25:44,456 --> 00:25:47,555
Thot Pran, I look forward
to working with you

501
00:25:47,597 --> 00:25:49,465
and the Breen Confederacy.

502
00:25:51,975 --> 00:25:54,037
Your first task
will be to make

503
00:25:54,081 --> 00:25:55,745
a formal address
to the Cardassian people

504
00:25:55,785 --> 00:25:57,483
assuring them
that the Dominion has

505
00:25:57,523 --> 00:25:58,617
their best interests...

506
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,788
That can wait.

507
00:25:59,829 --> 00:26:01,891
But it can wait.

508
00:26:01,968 --> 00:26:05,603
Now that the rebellion
has been crushed

509
00:26:05,644 --> 00:26:08,914
it is time to turn our attention
to strategic matters.

510
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:12,654
The enemy has devised
a countermeasure

511
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,496
to our energy-dampening weapons.

512
00:26:14,534 --> 00:26:17,132
Therefore,
we must alter our tactics.

513
00:26:17,174 --> 00:26:19,544
We are falling back.

514
00:26:20,783 --> 00:26:24,589
No.
I don't mean surrender.

515
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:26,186
Perish the thought.

516
00:26:26,231 --> 00:26:28,601
The Dominion has never
surrendered in battle

517
00:26:28,637 --> 00:26:30,767
since its founding
10,000 years ago.

518
00:26:30,809 --> 00:26:34,980
I am ordering our troops
to retreat to Cardassian space.

519
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:38,826
We will establish
a new line of defense

520
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:41,359
along this perimeter.

521
00:26:41,404 --> 00:26:44,606
With less territory to defend,
we can concentrate our troops

522
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:49,214
and hold off any attack
if the enemy attacks at all.

523
00:26:49,258 --> 00:26:53,965
The Federation is,
by its very nature, timid.

524
00:26:54,003 --> 00:26:57,034
When they see we've pulled back,
their first impulse will be

525
00:26:57,111 --> 00:26:58,239
to leave us alone.

526
00:26:58,281 --> 00:26:59,409
Well, what about the Klingons

527
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,750
and the Romulans and the?

528
00:27:02,057 --> 00:27:04,825
I meant no disrespect.

529
00:27:04,865 --> 00:27:07,862
I was simply asking a question.

530
00:27:07,905 --> 00:27:11,813
Without the Federation,
the others are no threat to us.

531
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:14,414
Once the new perimeter
is established

532
00:27:14,456 --> 00:27:17,692
we will redouble
our shipbuilding efforts

533
00:27:17,731 --> 00:27:20,899
and increase production
of Jem'Hadar troops.

534
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:24,847
Retreat may prolong the war,
but in the end

535
00:27:24,884 --> 00:27:26,548
we will emerge stronger

536
00:27:26,587 --> 00:27:30,552
and in a far better position
to take the Alpha Quadrant

537
00:27:30,598 --> 00:27:32,762
once and for all.

538
00:27:42,469 --> 00:27:45,443
Did you know this Congress
of Economic Meddlers

539
00:27:45,477 --> 00:27:50,218
actually passed legislation
making monopolies illegal?

540
00:27:50,255 --> 00:27:51,690
What's the point
of being in business

541
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,928
if you can't corner the market...
gouge your customers?

542
00:27:54,968 --> 00:27:56,871
There's something to be said
for keeping prices down

543
00:27:56,906 --> 00:27:58,466
by ensuring
healthy competition.

544
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,174
So... what are you
going to do with the bar?

545
00:28:00,215 --> 00:28:02,186
You can't even dump
industrial waste anymore

546
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,986
because it might harm
"the natural habitat."

547
00:28:04,024 --> 00:28:06,588
I'm supposed to start
worrying about animals now.

548
00:28:06,631 --> 00:28:08,066
Look how they live...

549
00:28:08,102 --> 00:28:09,662
wallowing in dirt,
sleeping in trees.

550
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:11,436
That's not natural.

551
00:28:11,477 --> 00:28:13,573
I suppose you could argue
that Ferenginar's biodiversity

552
00:28:13,616 --> 00:28:16,282
is a precious resource
that belongs to everyone.

553
00:28:16,323 --> 00:28:19,161
So... what are you going
to do with the bar?

554
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,635
And don't even get me started

555
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:23,573
about this whole
"labor rights" thing.

556
00:28:23,608 --> 00:28:25,374
What have we come to

557
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:26,973
if you can't demand
sexual favors

558
00:28:27,018 --> 00:28:28,317
from the people in your employ?

559
00:28:28,354 --> 00:28:30,724
Unharassed workers
are productive workers.

560
00:28:30,761 --> 00:28:33,735
So... what are you going to do
with the bar?!

561
00:28:33,769 --> 00:28:34,931
Sell it!

562
00:28:34,972 --> 00:28:36,567
What would I want with it
anymore?

563
00:28:36,609 --> 00:28:39,081
I'll give you
5,000 bars of latinum

564
00:28:39,115 --> 00:28:40,745
and not one slip more.

565
00:28:40,787 --> 00:28:42,188
That's reasonable.

566
00:28:42,223 --> 00:28:44,251
It is?

567
00:28:44,295 --> 00:28:48,067
I'm telling you, Rom,
our people have lost their way.

568
00:28:48,106 --> 00:28:50,077
I just happen to have a contract
right here.

569
00:28:50,111 --> 00:28:51,945
I read a report that over
40 percent of the population

570
00:28:51,983 --> 00:28:54,319
no longer believes
that you have to buy your way

571
00:28:54,356 --> 00:28:56,224
into the Divine Treasury
when you die.

572
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,890
Can I have your thumbprint
here, please?

573
00:28:57,931 --> 00:28:59,332
They don't teach children

574
00:28:59,369 --> 00:29:01,237
the Rules of Acquisition
anymore!

575
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:04,247
And another print here.

576
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,217
There's a disease...

577
00:29:06,253 --> 00:29:08,555
spreading
through Ferengi society.

578
00:29:09,762 --> 00:29:11,699
It's making us soft.

579
00:29:14,073 --> 00:29:16,044
The 5,000 has been transferred
to your account.

580
00:29:16,078 --> 00:29:17,878
It was a pleasure
doing business with you.

581
00:29:17,916 --> 00:29:19,351
5,000?

582
00:29:19,387 --> 00:29:21,791
I thought you were going to hold
me up for at least eight.

583
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:23,990
I didn't even haggle with you.

584
00:29:24,032 --> 00:29:25,126
I know!

585
00:29:25,169 --> 00:29:27,140
It really threw me off.

586
00:29:27,174 --> 00:29:28,404
What's wrong with me?

587
00:29:28,444 --> 00:29:29,413
Don't worry, Brother.

588
00:29:29,447 --> 00:29:31,111
You're going to be so rich

589
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:33,554
what's a few thousand
bars of latinum?

590
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,458
I've been infected, too.

591
00:29:35,495 --> 00:29:38,297
I haven't raised prices
in months.

592
00:29:38,336 --> 00:29:39,805
I've even been considering

593
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,506
letting the dabo girls
keep most of their tips.

594
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:44,245
I've gone soft!

595
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:46,084
I kind of like you better
this way.

596
00:29:46,123 --> 00:29:47,524
I don't...

597
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:50,659
and I'm going to do
something about it.

598
00:29:53,174 --> 00:29:55,738
This disease
has got to be stopped

599
00:29:55,781 --> 00:29:58,846
before it destroys everything
Ferenginar stands for.

600
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:01,054
If Zek wants me to be Nagus

601
00:30:01,095 --> 00:30:02,827
he's going to have
to let me do things

602
00:30:02,866 --> 00:30:05,498
my way, or else...

603
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:08,342
I'll turn down the job!

604
00:30:08,381 --> 00:30:09,907
Are you serious?!

605
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:11,682
You bet I am.

606
00:30:11,722 --> 00:30:14,126
But being Nagus
will make you rich.

607
00:30:14,162 --> 00:30:15,290
I don't care.

608
00:30:15,332 --> 00:30:18,670
I won't preside over the demise
of Ferengi civilization.

609
00:30:18,707 --> 00:30:19,903
Not me!

610
00:30:19,944 --> 00:30:22,941
The line has to be drawn here!

611
00:30:23,018 --> 00:30:26,186
This far and no further!

612
00:30:35,184 --> 00:30:36,653
This way.

613
00:30:36,687 --> 00:30:38,989
He's been in there too long.

614
00:30:39,027 --> 00:30:40,691
Something's wrong.

615
00:30:40,731 --> 00:30:43,431
You there. Stop.

616
00:30:43,472 --> 00:30:45,170
Let me see your work order.

617
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,204
But I showed it to you
on the way in.

618
00:30:47,248 --> 00:30:50,712
This has not been
approved by the First.

619
00:30:50,757 --> 00:30:53,731
Ah! Yes.

620
00:30:53,765 --> 00:30:54,893
I can explain that.

621
00:30:54,934 --> 00:30:56,164
How much time?

622
00:30:56,204 --> 00:30:59,941
The detonator only had
a three-minute delay.

623
00:30:59,981 --> 00:31:01,952
The bomb could go off
any second now.

624
00:31:08,971 --> 00:31:11,500
Gentlemen, this is ridiculous.

625
00:31:11,545 --> 00:31:13,516
Come on, Garak.

626
00:31:14,886 --> 00:31:16,378
We have to do something.

627
00:31:19,699 --> 00:31:21,967
I don't know why you're making
such a fuss over this.

628
00:31:22,004 --> 00:31:23,303
I have a busy repair schedule

629
00:31:23,342 --> 00:31:24,868
and I can't stand here
all night...

630
00:31:24,912 --> 00:31:28,877
You will wait here
till the First arrives.

631
00:31:28,922 --> 00:31:30,323
And how long will that be?

632
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,556
You will wait!

633
00:31:31,597 --> 00:31:34,399
You! Jem'Hadar!

634
00:31:34,437 --> 00:31:38,642
Who are you to treat
a Cardassian citizen like that?

635
00:31:39,684 --> 00:31:42,886
It's him... Damar!

636
00:31:42,926 --> 00:31:44,225
Hold him here.

637
00:31:45,433 --> 00:31:48,566
Surrender yourself, or die.

638
00:31:48,607 --> 00:31:50,943
I choose neither.

639
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:55,655
Back, get back!

640
00:32:20,724 --> 00:32:21,818
It's Damar.

641
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:23,799
It's Damar!

642
00:32:23,832 --> 00:32:25,666
He's alive!

643
00:32:25,703 --> 00:32:29,475
Citizens of Cardassia, hear me.

644
00:32:29,513 --> 00:32:33,718
The Dominion told you that
the rebellion has been crushed.

645
00:32:33,758 --> 00:32:35,854
What you have seen here today

646
00:32:35,896 --> 00:32:38,836
proves that that is
yet another lie.

647
00:32:38,871 --> 00:32:41,709
Our fight for freedom continues

648
00:32:41,745 --> 00:32:45,015
but it will take place here
in the streets.

649
00:32:45,054 --> 00:32:49,019
I call on Cardassians everywhere
to rise up.

650
00:32:49,064 --> 00:32:52,470
Rise up and join me.

651
00:32:52,506 --> 00:32:55,070
I need you to be my army.

652
00:32:55,113 --> 00:32:58,919
If we stand together,
nothing can oppose us.

653
00:32:58,956 --> 00:33:03,127
Freedom is ours for the taking!

654
00:33:03,167 --> 00:33:04,967
Freedom!

655
00:33:05,006 --> 00:33:06,909
Freedom!
Freedom!

656
00:33:06,944 --> 00:33:10,385
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

657
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,288
Freedom! Freedom!

658
00:33:19,143 --> 00:33:21,473
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

659
00:33:32,534 --> 00:33:35,599
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

660
00:33:39,552 --> 00:33:40,521
What?

661
00:33:40,555 --> 00:33:41,888
What are you smiling at?

662
00:33:41,959 --> 00:33:43,827
You know, I was thinking.

663
00:33:43,863 --> 00:33:44,832
If it hadn't been

664
00:33:44,866 --> 00:33:46,666
for our little talk
the other day

665
00:33:46,705 --> 00:33:49,075
we'd probably be
just standing here

666
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,602
staring at our shoes.

667
00:33:50,648 --> 00:33:51,617
No, not a chance.

668
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:53,814
I'd have turned
and walked the other way

669
00:33:53,856 --> 00:33:55,052
as soon as I saw you.

670
00:33:55,093 --> 00:33:57,292
I'm glad we've got
it all behind us.

671
00:33:57,332 --> 00:33:59,064
Me, too.

672
00:34:02,111 --> 00:34:03,603
Excuse me.

673
00:34:25,806 --> 00:34:29,076
Huh.
I guess they worked it out.

674
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,284
It always brings
a tear to my eye

675
00:34:46,326 --> 00:34:50,063
to see a Nagus pass his staff
to a successor.

676
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:56,945
It's a privilege to witness
such a historic moment.

677
00:34:56,987 --> 00:34:57,956
Just wait and see.

678
00:34:57,989 --> 00:35:00,291
It's going to be more
historic than you think.

679
00:35:00,328 --> 00:35:01,763
They're here!

680
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,774
There you are, my boy.

681
00:35:04,807 --> 00:35:05,867
I have...

682
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:08,748
something for you.

683
00:35:08,784 --> 00:35:10,414
Not so fast, Zek.

684
00:35:10,454 --> 00:35:11,855
We need to talk.

685
00:35:11,892 --> 00:35:13,988
I knew you were going
to make this difficult.

686
00:35:14,031 --> 00:35:16,265
My mind is made up, Quark.

687
00:35:16,304 --> 00:35:19,335
Whining and complaining
won't do anything.

688
00:35:19,378 --> 00:35:20,642
I won't have anything to do

689
00:35:20,682 --> 00:35:23,280
with what you're doing
to our once proud civilization.

690
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:25,851
A man can only be pushed so far.

691
00:35:25,895 --> 00:35:26,955
If you want me to be Nagus

692
00:35:26,998 --> 00:35:29,026
you're going to have
to let me do things my way.

693
00:35:31,175 --> 00:35:33,146
Who wants you to be Nagus?

694
00:35:34,283 --> 00:35:36,413
Out of the way, Quark.

695
00:35:38,494 --> 00:35:40,796
Congratulations, Rom.

696
00:35:40,834 --> 00:35:44,240
You're going to make
a fine Nagus.

697
00:35:45,545 --> 00:35:46,809
I am?

698
00:35:46,849 --> 00:35:48,409
What's wrong?

699
00:35:48,453 --> 00:35:49,479
You seemed so happy

700
00:35:49,523 --> 00:35:51,426
when I talked to you
the other day.

701
00:35:51,461 --> 00:35:52,953
I did?

702
00:35:52,998 --> 00:35:53,989
That was me.

703
00:35:54,035 --> 00:35:55,767
You?!

704
00:35:55,806 --> 00:35:59,748
Oh. I thought
I was talking to Rom.

705
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:01,811
Must have been all the static.

706
00:36:01,854 --> 00:36:03,791
Glad we cleared that up.

707
00:36:05,631 --> 00:36:06,861
This is insane.

708
00:36:06,902 --> 00:36:10,674
You actually want
Rom to be Nagus?

709
00:36:10,712 --> 00:36:12,580
It was my idea.

710
00:36:12,616 --> 00:36:14,246
Figures.

711
00:36:14,287 --> 00:36:16,258
He's an idiot.

712
00:36:16,293 --> 00:36:19,095
You've always underestimated
your brother.

713
00:36:19,133 --> 00:36:19,998
Shh!

714
00:36:20,035 --> 00:36:22,303
A new Ferenginar

715
00:36:22,341 --> 00:36:28,220
needs a new kind of Nagus...
a kinder, gentler Nagus...

716
00:36:29,259 --> 00:36:31,059
and that's you, my boy.

717
00:36:31,097 --> 00:36:33,433
It's a great responsibility

718
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:36,638
to stand at the bow
of the Ferengi ship of state.

719
00:36:36,678 --> 00:36:39,344
A Nagus has to navigate

720
00:36:39,385 --> 00:36:42,918
the waters of the Great Material

721
00:36:42,961 --> 00:36:47,496
Continuum, avoid
the Shoals of Bankruptcy

722
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:52,919
and seek the Strong Winds
of Prosperity.

723
00:36:57,733 --> 00:37:00,331
I'll do the best I can.

724
00:37:01,877 --> 00:37:05,444
May I be the first
to offer my congratulations?

725
00:37:08,261 --> 00:37:09,560
Oh, Rom!

726
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,295
Way to go, Dad.

727
00:37:13,341 --> 00:37:15,813
All right, you want Rom?

728
00:37:15,847 --> 00:37:17,909
You can have him.

729
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,650
In fact, you deserve him.

730
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:22,687
He's perfect for this new
workers' paradise of yours.

731
00:37:22,732 --> 00:37:26,606
He can save the environment
and levy all the taxes he wants.

732
00:37:26,642 --> 00:37:30,106
He's not taking it very well.

733
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,676
In fact, as far
as I'm concerned...

734
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:37,796
the Ferenginar that I knew
doesn't exist anymore.

735
00:37:37,837 --> 00:37:41,574
No... I take that back.

736
00:37:41,614 --> 00:37:46,251
It will exist,
right here in this bar.

737
00:37:46,326 --> 00:37:49,266
This establishment

738
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:53,743
will be the last outpost
of what made Ferenginar great...

739
00:37:53,778 --> 00:37:57,276
the unrelenting lust
for profit!

740
00:37:57,388 --> 00:38:00,760
Broik, water the drinks!

741
00:38:00,796 --> 00:38:04,363
M'Pella, rig the dabo table!

742
00:38:04,406 --> 00:38:08,439
Rom... I want
to buy back the bar.

743
00:38:08,484 --> 00:38:10,079
That's all right, Brother.

744
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,385
I'll give it to you.

745
00:38:11,424 --> 00:38:13,258
I suppose you're going to let me

746
00:38:13,296 --> 00:38:15,358
keep the 5,000 bars
of latinum, too.

747
00:38:15,402 --> 00:38:17,202
You're my brother.

748
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,972
And you're an idiot.

749
00:38:20,281 --> 00:38:22,480
But I love you.

750
00:38:24,391 --> 00:38:26,385
Congratulations.

751
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:30,669
You're the perfect Nagus
for this new Ferenginar.

752
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:34,548
Are you sure we picked
the right brother?

753
00:38:34,584 --> 00:38:36,783
Come, my dear.

754
00:38:36,824 --> 00:38:39,626
Risa's waiting.

755
00:38:41,502 --> 00:38:42,903
Good luck, kid!

756
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,740
You're going to need it.

757
00:38:46,081 --> 00:38:48,109
I'm proud of you, son.

758
00:38:50,793 --> 00:38:52,593
Let's go, Zekkie.

759
00:38:54,971 --> 00:38:58,913
You know... I could use
a financial advisor.

760
00:38:58,947 --> 00:39:01,613
No kidding, but it's
not going to be me.

761
00:39:01,655 --> 00:39:03,854
I know someone who's available.

762
00:39:03,894 --> 00:39:05,329
Forget it!

763
00:39:05,398 --> 00:39:07,962
Not so hasty... let him
give you a pedicure first.

764
00:39:08,005 --> 00:39:10,705
Now, if you'll excuse me

765
00:39:10,745 --> 00:39:12,716
I've got to get back to work.

766
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,850
There's money to be made.

767
00:39:18,198 --> 00:39:20,169
How can I serve you, my...

768
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:29,725
Wow.

769
00:39:35,443 --> 00:39:37,346
According
to our intelligence reports

770
00:39:37,381 --> 00:39:39,284
the Dominion has
withdrawn completely

771
00:39:39,319 --> 00:39:42,418
from Klingon, Federation
and Romulan space.

772
00:39:42,528 --> 00:39:44,692
They seem to be forming
a new defensive perimeter

773
00:39:44,733 --> 00:39:47,035
within Cardassian territory.

774
00:39:47,072 --> 00:39:48,541
They must know we've developed

775
00:39:48,577 --> 00:39:50,445
a countermeasure
to the Breen weapon.

776
00:39:50,482 --> 00:39:52,578
That would be my guess.

777
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,557
There are advantages
to falling back.

778
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:56,152
They shorten their supply lines

779
00:39:56,196 --> 00:39:57,962
while forcing us
to lengthen ours.

780
00:39:58,001 --> 00:39:59,231
And with a smaller perimeter

781
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:01,401
they're less vulnerable
to hit-and-run attacks.

782
00:40:01,443 --> 00:40:04,109
It would take a major offensive
to break through their lines.

783
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:06,121
At a cost of thousands of ships.

784
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:08,252
The wiser course
would be to simply

785
00:40:08,294 --> 00:40:10,493
contain them
within their perimeter.

786
00:40:10,534 --> 00:40:12,505
That's what they're hoping
we'll do...

787
00:40:12,539 --> 00:40:14,841
to give them time
to rebuild their forces.

788
00:40:14,878 --> 00:40:16,313
He's right.

789
00:40:16,349 --> 00:40:18,217
We have them on the defensive.

790
00:40:18,253 --> 00:40:20,053
We should hit them
with everything we've got.

791
00:40:20,092 --> 00:40:21,459
Breaking through that line

792
00:40:21,495 --> 00:40:24,263
would be a very ugly,
very bloody job.

793
00:40:24,303 --> 00:40:26,707
If we do nothing

794
00:40:26,743 --> 00:40:29,876
the Dominion could sit
behind that perimeter

795
00:40:29,917 --> 00:40:32,038
for the next five years
rearming themselves

796
00:40:32,171 --> 00:40:35,043
and when they're ready
to come out, God help us all.

797
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:39,420
The Klingon Empire
votes to attack now

798
00:40:39,457 --> 00:40:41,895
before they have time
to recover.

799
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:47,134
Considering the alternatives...

800
00:40:47,177 --> 00:40:49,979
I'm afraid I have to concur.

801
00:40:53,794 --> 00:40:54,888
Very well.

802
00:40:56,735 --> 00:40:59,401
Then it's settled.

803
00:40:59,442 --> 00:41:01,276
We attack.

804
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,415
You're up late.

805
00:41:21,901 --> 00:41:23,531
You waiting for me?

806
00:41:27,882 --> 00:41:29,876
What's wrong?

807
00:41:33,965 --> 00:41:35,765
I'm pregnant.

808
00:41:38,711 --> 00:41:40,271
Are you sure?

809
00:41:40,315 --> 00:41:42,787
Of course I'm sure.

810
00:41:45,596 --> 00:41:48,000
Oh.

811
00:41:48,035 --> 00:41:49,504
Baby, I...

812
00:41:49,539 --> 00:41:51,407
I didn't mean...

813
00:41:52,413 --> 00:41:54,647
A... a baby.

814
00:41:56,324 --> 00:41:58,694
You and me...

815
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:00,998
a... wow.

816
00:42:01,035 --> 00:42:02,004
Surprise.

817
00:42:02,038 --> 00:42:03,975
"Surprise" is right.

818
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:06,505
Uh... how did... you?

819
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:08,612
- One of us...
- One of us...

820
00:42:08,655 --> 00:42:11,754
forgot our injection last month.

821
00:42:16,074 --> 00:42:19,914
Julian reminded me of that.

822
00:42:19,951 --> 00:42:23,187
It's just that the way things
have been going on...

823
00:42:23,227 --> 00:42:25,061
You don't have to apologize.

824
00:42:25,098 --> 00:42:26,728
I'm not!

825
00:42:26,769 --> 00:42:28,136
Are you kidding?

826
00:42:28,173 --> 00:42:31,671
This... this is wonderful.

827
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:35,248
I'm glad you think so.

828
00:42:36,294 --> 00:42:37,820
But you don't.

829
00:42:39,001 --> 00:42:41,998
I just keep thinking
about the Prophets.

830
00:42:42,042 --> 00:42:43,672
They warned you

831
00:42:43,712 --> 00:42:46,378
that marrying me
would bring you sorrow.

832
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:48,550
Kasidy, we have
been through this.

833
00:42:48,592 --> 00:42:53,127
I know we have, and I...
I know that we said

834
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:55,642
we wouldn't let the Prophets
run our lives

835
00:42:55,678 --> 00:42:56,874
but that was...

836
00:42:57,916 --> 00:43:00,388
that was before this.

837
00:43:00,423 --> 00:43:02,657
What if...

838
00:43:02,696 --> 00:43:07,072
what if they were trying
to tell you something?

839
00:43:07,107 --> 00:43:09,237
That something would
happen to our baby?

840
00:43:09,279 --> 00:43:11,182
Shh.

841
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:20,003
Nothing... is going
to happen to our baby.

842
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,170
Are you sure?

843
00:43:22,213 --> 00:43:24,447
I am the Emissary
of the Prophets

844
00:43:24,486 --> 00:43:28,394
and I know that nothing
is going to happen.

845
00:43:28,429 --> 00:43:30,958
Everything is going
to be all right.

846
00:43:33,074 --> 00:43:35,342
I hope you're right.

847
00:43:46,409 --> 00:43:47,901
We're going to have a baby.

848
00:43:50,686 --> 00:43:52,281
A baby.
