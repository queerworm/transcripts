1
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,466
Anything yet?

2
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:08,509
Should be here any minute.

3
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:10,010
Running
a little late.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,971
This is no way to start
a relationship.

5
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:14,556
Hi, Ezri.

6
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:18,059
So, how's Odo?

7
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:19,812
Oh, his body
shows no signs

8
00:00:19,812 --> 00:00:21,146
of the changeling
disease.

9
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,439
I believe he's cured.

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,232
Oh, that's great.

11
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,696
Yes, in fact, um...

12
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:31,239
I'm going to discharge
him this afternoon.

13
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,492
That's... that's
really great.

14
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:34,535
Yeah.

15
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:41,458
I don't get it.

16
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,919
He's interested,
she's interested.

17
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,420
What's the problem?

18
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,382
He is an
overgrown child

19
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:52,093
and she is
very... confused.

20
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,346
It could still work.

21
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:55,556
(<i> console beeping</i> )

22
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,516
She's here.

23
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,062
On screen.

24
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:08,109
EZRI:
I didn't know we were

25
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,195
getting another
Defiant-class ship.

26
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,823
That's what happens
when you miss staff meetings.

27
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:15,826
Looks... just like her.

28
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:18,037
Let's hope she fights like her.

29
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:27,004
ROSS:
All hands, attention to orders.

30
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:29,965
From Starfleet Headquarters,
Office of the Admiralty

31
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:32,426
to Captain Benjamin L. Sisko.

32
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:35,303
As of this date,
you are requested and required

33
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:37,264
to take command
of USS<i> Sao Paulo.</i>

34
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:42,853
Signed, Vice Admiral William
J. Ross, Stardate 52861.3.

35
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:46,065
Computer, transfer
all command codes

36
00:01:46,065 --> 00:01:47,066
to Captain Sisko.

37
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:49,317
Command codes transferred.

38
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,318
I relieve you, sir.

39
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:51,779
I stand relieved.

40
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:54,364
She's all yours, Ben.
You've a fine ship here.

41
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:58,118
She has some...
big shoes to fill.

42
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:04,374
I hate the carpet.
I do.

43
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,960
Oh, uh, by the way

44
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,462
there's, uh, something else
on that padd

45
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,005
that might interest you.

46
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,052
Special Dispensation

47
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:16,845
from the Chief
of Starfleet Operations

48
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:21,266
to change the name
from<i> Sao Paulo</i>

49
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,350
to<i> Defiant.</i>

50
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,115
The Breen are going
to be in for a surprise

51
00:02:36,115 --> 00:02:37,992
when they train their
energy-dampening weapons

52
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:38,951
on this beauty, huh?

53
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:40,119
The shield generators

54
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:42,037
have been completely
reconfigured.

55
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:44,039
Let's go look.

56
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,206
You know what?

57
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,917
I, uh, want to check out
my Sick Bay.

58
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,589
Well, I'll let you two

59
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,173
get acquainted.

60
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,190
Hello, ship.

61
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:19,908
GARAK:
Cardassia.

62
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:23,662
It's as beautiful as I remember.

63
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:26,123
It won't be beautiful to my eyes
until the Dominion is gone.

64
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:27,374
Orbital Traffic Control

65
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,001
is asking for our
security clearance.

66
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:30,669
GARAK:
I'll handle it.

67
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,171
We're taking a big risk
coming here.

68
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:33,254
I hope it's worth it.

69
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,840
Gul Revok
and Legate Goris

70
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,384
are ready to bring their
troops over to our side.

71
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,427
That's over
a half a million men.

72
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:41,930
If we can convince Gul Seltan
to join us as well

73
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,015
that's another 100,000.

74
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:44,307
I think that is
worth the risk.

75
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,560
And you're sure
you want me around?

76
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,020
Before they join us,
they'll want assurances

77
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,646
that the Federation
will support them.

78
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,648
We've been cleared
for standard orbit.

79
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,025
Do you have transport
coordinates?

80
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:55,152
Yes. Transporter room
is standing by.

81
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,820
Then the Bridge
is yours, Seskal.

82
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,364
Good luck.

83
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,914
(<i> shouting and weapons' fire)</i>

84
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,336
(<i> screaming</i> )

85
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:16,924
Is that all
of them?

86
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:18,133
Yes, sir.

87
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,927
Check the other
side of the cave!

88
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,386
Inform the First
that we have killed
all the traitors.

89
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,138
How did they know?

90
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:24,181
Well, well, well.

91
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,391
What do we have here?

92
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,393
I told you I could
lure them here for you.

93
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,353
Gul Revok.

94
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,647
He betrayed us.

95
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,816
Kira to Seskal.
Get us out of here.

96
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,193
We're under attack!

97
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:39,238
I can't lower the shields!

98
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,908
Lock the disruptors
and return fire!

99
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:45,244
Transfer the auxiliary
power to...

100
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:46,995
(<i> screaming</i> )

101
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,919
Seskal?

102
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:56,379
Seskal?

103
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:56,750
Seskal?

104
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,085
Seskal, do you read me?

105
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,170
I don't think
they're up there anymore.

106
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,255
We've got to get out of here.

107
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:02,839
No.

108
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,466
Damar, do you know
any place we can go?

109
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,843
Everyone I know
on Cardassia

110
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,427
has either been
arrested or killed.

111
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,389
I think I know someone
who might take us in.

112
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:12,015
That is, if we can
get to the capital.

113
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,350
Well, we can't stay here.

114
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,819
MILA:
If you don't mind hiding
in a basement

115
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,281
then I guess I don't mind
having you down here.

116
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:33,912
I don't hear from
you for years

117
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:37,498
and then you show up
on my doorstep

118
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,918
with these people.

119
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,962
GARAK:
I do apologize for the intrusion

120
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:45,048
but you're the only person
on Cardassia I could trust.

121
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:49,177
MILA:
Well, don't blame me if you
don't have any friends left.

122
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:52,597
Well, now, where's
that light switch?

123
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:55,600
GARAK:
It's smaller than I remember.

124
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,477
I grew up in
this house.

125
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,895
Did I mention that?

126
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,147
I thought you said

127
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:01,315
Enabran Tain used
to live here.

128
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,858
Tain was Garak's father.

129
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,860
He was unable to
acknowledge it publicly

130
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,280
because he was head
of the Obsidian Order.

131
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,367
Mila was our housekeeper
and most trusted confidante.

132
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,953
I was never much of a cook

133
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,788
but I knew how to keep a secret.

134
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:18,623
We have to contact the
other resistance cells

135
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,208
and warn them
about Revok.

136
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,419
Is there any way you
can get us a com unit?

137
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,629
If it's not too much
of an imposition.

138
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,257
You shouldn't be involved
in this.

139
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,468
We're attempting
to free our people.

140
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:31,428
Do you want to live
under the Dominion

141
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,013
for the rest of your life?

142
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,015
(<i> chuckles</i> )

143
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,641
I'm an old woman.

144
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:40,145
I'm long past caring
about such things.

145
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:43,231
But I'll get you your com unit.

146
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,565
Mila...

147
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,526
thank you.

148
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,695
I promise we won't stay long.

149
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,408
Well, you might as well
make yourselves useful.

150
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:56,619
This place hasn't
been cleaned in years.

151
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,711
You heard the lady.

152
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:11,176
The glamour of being
a revolutionary, hmm?

153
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,266
Well, everything
checks out fine.

154
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,143
I'm certifying you
fit for duty.

155
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,396
Finally. Last
time I spoke

156
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,856
with Kira, she wanted to know
when I'd be rejoining her.

157
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:27,401
Odo, um...

158
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,610
there is something
you need to know.

159
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,196
When I first discovered

160
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:34,866
that you had become infected
with the morphogenic virus

161
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:37,411
I assumed you'd contracted it
from the Founders.

162
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,580
Didn't I?

163
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,665
No.

164
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,459
The fact is, it was you

165
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,711
who transmitted
the disease to them.

166
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,259
But...

167
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,679
how did<i> I</i> get it?

168
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:59,307
You were deliberately infected.

169
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,101
By whom?

170
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,144
Section 31.

171
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,564
They used you
as a carrier

172
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:07,941
hoping you would pass on
the disease to the Founders.

173
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,025
I'm sure you
were never meant

174
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,651
to develop
symptoms, but...

175
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:13,530
I don't care whether
they meant to kill me or not.

176
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:18,368
The reality is, the Federation
set out to destroy my people.

177
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,828
Section 31 aren't part
of the Federation.

178
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:21,996
They're a rogue organization...

179
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,457
Don't split hairs

180
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:24,958
with me, Doctor.

181
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,211
They used me

182
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:30,088
as an instrument

183
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,672
to try to commit genocide.

184
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:34,008
Now, we may be at war
with the Founders

185
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,094
but that's no excuse.

186
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,348
I completely agree.

187
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:45,103
And what does Starfleet
intend to do about it?

188
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,563
The Federation Council

189
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,940
considered giving
the Founders the cure.

190
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,817
Then they decided against it.

191
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,902
Then they're abetting genocide.

192
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,738
I don't condone
what Section 31 did

193
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,949
but the Founders
started this war, not us.

194
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:01,161
Giving them the cure
would strengthen their hand...

195
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:04,164
and we can't do that.

196
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,624
Not when there are still

197
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:07,917
millions of men and women
out there

198
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,753
putting their lives
on the line every day.

199
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,589
Well, I can see
there's no use protesting.

200
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,466
The decision's been made.

201
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:18,345
Odo, I wish I didn't
have to say this

202
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,971
but I need to know

203
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:22,140
you're not going to take
matters into your own hands.

204
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,480
You have my word.

205
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,982
That's all I needed to hear.

206
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:33,568
Interesting, isn't it?

207
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:37,113
The Federation claims
to abhor Section 31's

208
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,658
tactics, but when they need
their dirty work done

209
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,660
they look the other way.

210
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,539
It's a tidy little arrangement,
wouldn't you say?

211
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:58,051
Go ahead.
What have you got to lose?

212
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,052
Our jobs.

213
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,512
Let's do it.

214
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:02,721
At this point, I don't
care if he fires me.

215
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:03,973
That's the spirit.

216
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,017
Remember,
ask for ten percent

217
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,561
but settle for 15.

218
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:09,646
Okay.

219
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:15,569
Quark...

220
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:16,903
we have something
to say.

221
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,112
Then say it.

222
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,614
We don't think
we should have

223
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:21,157
to give you 20 percent
of our tips.

224
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,201
Mm-hmm.

225
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:26,829
We think ten percent
is more than fair

226
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,748
and we're not going back to
work until this is settled.

227
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,501
Ten percent?

228
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:34,921
Quark, there's an incoming
transmission from Ferenginar!

229
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,173
It's the Grand Nagus!

230
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,093
I'll take it in the back room.

231
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,178
LEETA:
Well?

232
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,597
I'll think about it.

233
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,974
What did he say?

234
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,143
He's going to
think about it.

235
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,187
(<i> laughing</i> )

236
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,408
(<i> staticky</i> ):
Is that you ...?

237
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:04,701
It's me.

238
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,869
I can barely see you.

239
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,996
It's the static.

240
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,498
Sorry about the static.

241
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,750
It's raining here.

242
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,753
It's always raining there.

243
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:16,588
Not this kind of rain.

244
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:18,965
...an accident
at the power plant.

245
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,301
The contractor used

246
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:26,013
substandard relays,
the greedy bastard.

247
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:31,645
There's a toxic electrostatic
cloud hanging over the city.

248
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:33,688
What a frigging mess.

249
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:37,776
So, what do I owe the pleasure?

250
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,068
The pressure?

251
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,070
That's an ungrateful thing
to say.

252
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,405
I'm not pressuring you.

253
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:46,284
No... "the pleasure."

254
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,161
You're not making any sense.

255
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,121
Now shut up and listen.

256
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,915
I'm retiring.

257
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,376
Your mother and I

258
00:13:55,376 --> 00:14:00,006
are moving to Risa
to enjoy our old age

259
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:05,011
and do a lot of ...,
if you know what I mean.

260
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,515
Good for you...

261
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:09,599
I guess.

262
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:12,851
I'll be coming to Deep Space 9

263
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,937
to name my successor.

264
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,481
Why here?

265
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,191
Why do you think?

266
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,942
To get away from the rain?

267
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,736
No, my boy.

268
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:24,781
I've chosen you to succeed me.

269
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:27,701
You're going to be

270
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:30,203
the new Grand Nagus.

271
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,954
Congratulations....

272
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,799
(<i> gasps</i> )

273
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,558
(<i> both gasping</i> )

274
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:52,726
Oh, I'm sorry.

275
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:53,643
(<i> laughing</i> )

276
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,687
I'm sorry.

277
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:57,230
(<i> both laughing</i> )

278
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,314
I'm sorry.

279
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,273
I nearly... Hi.

280
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,192
Hi.

281
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:02,318
Your lunch?

282
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,862
Uh, it's that time.

283
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:05,739
Oh.

284
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,741
This is ridiculous.

285
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,617
I know.

286
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,828
I have a confession...
Listen, I've been
meaning to tell you...

287
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:12,829
You go first.

288
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,121
No, that's all right.

289
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,583
No, really, Julian.
You go first.

290
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,292
Okay.

291
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:22,338
You know how much
I value our friendship.

292
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:27,218
Well... lately,
I've been wondering

293
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:30,847
if... maybe we could be...

294
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,766
Something more?

295
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:33,767
Yes.

296
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:34,934
Exactly.

297
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,143
I've been wondering
the same thing.

298
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,270
Oh, I thought
it was just me.

299
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,730
Me, too.

300
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,398
That's why I've been
so awkward around you.

301
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:41,691
I've been trying to tell
you, but every time I...

302
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:42,817
It just...

303
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:44,068
I couldn't
get the words...

304
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,194
I know, what is that?

305
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,237
I don't...

306
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,447
(<i> sighs</i> )

307
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,782
I mean, I'm not
usually like this.

308
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,157
If, if I find
somebody attractive

309
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,159
I just, I just,
I just tell them

310
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,329
and I don't play
these ridiculous games.

311
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,456
Neither do I.

312
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,421
You know...

313
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,632
why we might
be holding back?

314
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,341
The friendship.

315
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:10,094
You're right.

316
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,721
Why jeopardize
our friendship

317
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,474
uh, by trying to turn this
into something else?

318
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,017
I've made
that mistake before.

319
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:18,436
Yes, and once you
cross the line...

320
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:19,604
You can never go back.

321
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,355
And if it
doesn't work out

322
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,566
you can never
be friends again.

323
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:26,235
I can't bear the thought
of losing you as a friend.

324
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,528
Neither can I.

325
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,828
So that's that.

326
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:37,371
We figured it out.

327
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,793
You know, it takes
a certain maturity

328
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:44,712
to not be swept away
by the romantic fantasy.

329
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:45,880
That's right.

330
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,214
Why let, uh...

331
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,300
physical attraction
overcome good sense?

332
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,344
Chemistry
isn't everything.

333
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,303
Absolutely not.

334
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,972
We're adults.

335
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:55,348
I think we should be
proud of ourselves.

336
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:56,557
So do I.

337
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,392
I feel much better.

338
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,393
Friends?

339
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,729
Friends.

340
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,524
Just think, this time next week

341
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:07,360
I'll be living
in the Nagal residence.

342
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,737
They say even
the waste extraction fixtures

343
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,322
are plated with latinum.

344
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,365
That's right!

345
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,658
(<i> laughing</i> )

346
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,493
Oh, oh, the first thing
I'm going to do

347
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:18,705
is rip them out and replace them
with solid latinum fixtures.

348
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,289
(<i> laughing</i> )

349
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,208
That's a little indulgent,
don't you think?

350
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,377
Of course.
That's the point.

351
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:28,130
A Nagus has to lead
by example.

352
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,300
My greed has to be
a shining light to everyone

353
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,220
a testament
to the rewards of avarice.

354
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,514
Now, I hope you're
not going to be lonely

355
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:40,059
in that great big
Nagal residence.

356
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,436
QUARK:
I've got a room
picked out for you

357
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,897
already, my dear

358
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:46,440
with a view
of the Tower of Commerce

359
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,320
and, uh, there'll be
a place for my dear brother

360
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,446
my brave nephew

361
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,240
and my lovely
sister-in-law.

362
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,658
Liquidator Brunt!

363
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,994
Uh, not him.
Uh-uh.

364
00:17:57,994 --> 00:17:59,662
No. He's<i> here.</i>

365
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:10,506
What brings you here
this time, Brunt?

366
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,258
(<i> scoffing laugh</i> )

367
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:15,636
Ferenginar is rife

368
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,637
with rumors.

369
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:17,680
They say

370
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,974
the Grand Nagus is coming to DS9

371
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,393
to name his successor.

372
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:27,189
For once, the rumors...
are right.

373
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,276
I see.

374
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:40,369
A thousand...
congratulations, my Nagus.

375
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:44,123
He's not Nagus yet.

376
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,584
It's never too early
to suck up to the boss.

377
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:49,670
I think I'm going
to like being Nagus.

378
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,255
Don't stop.

379
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:55,426
...and thanks to the heroic
efforts of Gul Revok

380
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:59,555
Damar was lured to Cardassia
to meet with five other traitors

381
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,933
but his coconspirators
were killed

382
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:05,269
before they could begin plotting
against the people of Cardassia

383
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:08,272
and Damar himself was killed

384
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,524
while trying to penetrate
our defense perimeters

385
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:13,277
in a stolen Dominion vessel.

386
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,071
At least they're not looking
for us anymore.

387
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,906
WEYOUN:
...just hours ago

388
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,659
acting on information obtained
by our intelligence operatives

389
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:22,244
our brave troops began

390
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:26,124
a coordinated assault
on Damar's terrorist bases.

391
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:31,963
From Atbar Prime to Regulak IV,
from Simperia to Quinor VII

392
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:36,509
our forces eliminated
a total of 18 rebel bases.

393
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,677
With the rebellion crushed...

394
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,512
All 18?

395
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:43,599
...nothing can impede
our march to final victory.

396
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:50,272
Truly, this is a great day
for the Dominion.

397
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:54,443
How could they have compromised
our entire organization?

398
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,903
We took every
precaution

399
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,237
encrypted every
transmission, screened...

400
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:59,239
It doesn't matter
how they did it.

401
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,533
It's done.

402
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:07,081
Now we've got to find
a way off Cardassia.

403
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,124
Garak, can we use that thing

404
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,667
to contact
the Federation?

405
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:12,211
With a signal that strong,
the Dominion would trace

406
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,713
our location
in a matter of seconds.

407
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:16,966
Well, we've<i> got</i> to do something.

408
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:19,593
We are<i> not</i> spending
the rest of this war

409
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,387
in this cellar, are we?

410
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,104
<i>Are</i> we?

411
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,658
Financial advisor...

412
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,410
I don't know.

413
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,913
I do have lots of connections
on Ferenginar.

414
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,247
I don't need
your connections.

415
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,083
As Nagus, people
will be lining up

416
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,667
to do business with me.

417
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,294
You missed a spot.

418
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,005
Oh.

419
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:58,674
I'm sure there must
be something I can do

420
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,426
to make you
change your mind.

421
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,719
Possibly.

422
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:06,140
Would... 40 bricks

423
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,559
of gold-pressed latinum
do the trick?

424
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,436
No, but 70 would.

425
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:11,478
Fifty.

426
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,479
Sixty.

427
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,648
Done.
(<i> laughing</i> )

428
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,692
If you'll sign this.

429
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:17,693
What is it?

430
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:18,652
A receipt.

431
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,653
For a bribe?

432
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:22,448
Oh, surely you're aware

433
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,366
of the new regulation
making all bribes

434
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,409
tax-deductible.

435
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,368
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

436
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:29,288
Did you just use the T-word?

437
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,748
You mean "tax"?

438
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:34,668
Are you telling me there are...
Ts on Ferenginar?

439
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,587
You<i> haven't</i> been keeping up

440
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:38,798
with the latest reforms,
have you?

441
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,466
Zek instituted

442
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:43,427
progressive income tax
three months ago.

443
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,971
You call that a reform?

444
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:48,557
Taxes go against the very spirit
of free enterprise.

445
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:49,892
That's why they

446
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:51,269
call it "free."

447
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:53,353
The government needed revenues

448
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,940
to fund
the new social programs--

449
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,901
wage subsidies
for the poor

450
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,736
retirement benefits
for the aged

451
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:01,695
health care for...

452
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:02,780
Stop, stop, stop.

453
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:07,201
I had no idea
things had gotten so bad.

454
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:10,663
This is all Moogie's fault.

455
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:13,874
She's been polluting Zek's mind
with notions of equality

456
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,375
and compassion.

457
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,502
Whatever happened

458
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,378
to survival of the fittest?

459
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,006
Whatever happened
to the rich getting richer

460
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:21,423
and the poor getting poorer?

461
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:24,844
Whatever happened
to pure, unadulterated...

462
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,679
Greed.
greed?

463
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:30,308
Well, things change.

464
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:32,350
And they're going
to change back.

465
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,858
The first thing I'm going to do

466
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:41,152
is eliminate
these so-called reforms

467
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,779
before Ferenginar ends
up looking like a...

468
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,363
Federation planet.

469
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:46,740
Oh, I'm not sure

470
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,202
the Congress of Economic
Advisors will approve.

471
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:51,996
I don't care who they are
or what they are.

472
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:54,581
As Nagus, I can do what I want.

473
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:55,916
Not anymore.

474
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,961
All regulations
proposed by the Nagus

475
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:00,504
have to be ratified

476
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:03,216
by the Congress
before they become law.

477
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:04,717
Oh, you'll still be
a powerful man.

478
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,886
I wouldn't be sucking up
to you otherwise.

479
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:14,268
Blessed Exchequer, forgive us.

480
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:18,772
Your children
have gone astray.

481
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,486
(<i> door opens</i> )

482
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,659
MILA:
If only they could see you now.

483
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,119
Who?

484
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,662
The people in
the streets.

485
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:37,250
Everyone's talking

486
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,877
about Damar
and his rebels.

487
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:41,503
What are they saying?

488
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:45,091
How stupid we were for walking
into a Dominion trap?

489
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:46,759
How arrogant we were

490
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,178
to think we could beat them
in the first place?

491
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:52,098
How glad they are
that we're all dead?

492
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:54,600
Actually, they don't
really believe you<i> are</i> dead.

493
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,352
Oh, you should
hear the stories.

494
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,729
"Damar is alive.

495
00:23:58,729 --> 00:23:59,939
"My cousin saw him

496
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,815
on Kelvas Prime."

497
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,901
"He faked his own death."

498
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:06,237
"He is plotting

499
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:08,364
"a new offensive

500
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,408
from his secret
mountain hideaway."

501
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:13,827
You never told me you had
a secret mountain hideaway.

502
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:16,122
I was going to surprise you.

503
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:19,041
I wonder why they refuse
to believe you're dead.

504
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,585
Oh, they've been lied to
so often.

505
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:24,630
They don't trust anything
the Dominion says.

506
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,384
No, what if it's more than that?

507
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:29,843
What if we had
more of an impact

508
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,637
than we realized?

509
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:34,098
What if we turned you
into a legend?

510
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:35,849
(<i> snorts</i> )

511
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:36,976
Some legend.

512
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,602
Don't you see?

513
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,854
The people<i> want</i>
to believe in you.

514
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,189
We can use that.

515
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,400
Yes, the organized resistance
is gone

516
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,570
but there's an entire
civilian population out there

517
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,157
that is fed up with living
under the occupation

518
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:53,951
and if Damar,
the man they couldn't kill

519
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,577
tells the people of Cardassia

520
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,163
to rise up
against the Dominion...

521
00:24:57,163 --> 00:25:00,540
Then we might have
a revolution on our hands.

522
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,877
Or you might really
get yourselves killed.

523
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:06,630
Anything's better
than rotting in this cellar.

524
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:09,842
How do we begin?

525
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,389
Where's the closest
Jem'Hadar barracks?

526
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:19,517
(<i> door chimes</i> )

527
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:21,603
Come in.

(<i> electronically</i>

Allow me to present Gul--
no, I'm sorry-- Legate Broca

530
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:32,448
the new leader
of the Cardassian Union.

531
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:41,290
I serve the Founders
in all things.

532
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,792
Your service is noted.

533
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:47,004
Thot Pran, I look forward
to working with you

534
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:48,922
and the Breen
Confederacy.

535

(<i> distorted voice</i> )

536
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,593
Your first task
will be to make

537
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:55,304
a formal address to
the Cardassian people

538
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:56,930
assuring them that
the Dominion has

539
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:57,931
their best
interests...

540
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,266
That can wait.

541
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,435
But it can wait.

542
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:05,272
Now that the rebellion
has been crushed

543
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,690
it is time to turn our attention

544
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,317
to strategic
matters.

545
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:12,071
The enemy has devised
a countermeasure

546
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,822
to our energy-dampening weapons.

547
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,534
Therefore,
we must alter our tactics.

548
00:26:16,534 --> 00:26:18,952
We are falling back.

549
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,246
(<i> distorted voice</i> )

550
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:23,790
No.
I don't mean surrender.

551
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,501
Perish the thought.

552
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:28,087
The Dominion has never
surrendered in battle

553
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:30,130
since its founding
10,000 years ago.

554
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:34,468
I am ordering our troops
to retreat to Cardassian space.

555
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:38,180
We will establish
a new line of defense

556
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,849
along this perimeter.

557
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,936
With less territory to defend,
we can concentrate our troops

558
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:48,524
and hold off any attack
if the enemy attacks at all.

559
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:53,446
The Federation is,
by its very nature, timid.

560
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:56,449
When they see we've pulled back,
their first impulse will be

561
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:57,615
to leave us alone.

562
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:58,742
Well, what about the Klingons

563
00:26:58,742 --> 00:26:59,952
and the Romulans
and the...?

564
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:04,206
I meant no disrespect.

565
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:07,167
I was simply asking a question.

566
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:11,046
Without the Federation,
the others are no threat to us.

567
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,715
Once the new perimeter
is established

568
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:17,136
we will redouble
our shipbuilding efforts

569
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:20,306
and increase production
of Jem'Hadar troops.

570
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:23,976
Retreat may prolong the war,
but in the end

571
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,769
we will emerge stronger

572
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:29,940
and in a far better position
to take the Alpha Quadrant

573
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,900
once and for all.

574
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:44,913
QUARK:
Did you know this Congress
of Economic Meddlers

575
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:49,502
actually passed legislation
making monopolies illegal?

576
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:51,170
What's the point
of being in business

577
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,838
if you can't
corner the market--

578
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,423
gouge your customers?

579
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,216
There's something to be said
for keeping prices down

580
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,010
by ensuring
healthy competition.

581
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,470
So... what are you
going to do with the bar?

582
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,305
You can't even dump
industrial waste anymore

583
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:03,056
because it might harm
"the natural habitat."

584
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,809
I'm supposed to start
worrying about animals now.

585
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,019
Look how they live--

586
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,728
wallowing in dirt,
sleeping in trees.

587
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:10,648
That's not natural.

588
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:12,858
I suppose you could argue
that Ferenginar's biodiversity

589
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:15,319
is a precious resource
that belongs to everyone.

590
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:18,030
So... what are you going
to do with the bar?

591
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:20,824
And don't even get me started

592
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,618
about this whole
"labor rights" thing.

593
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:24,453
What have we come to

594
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,038
if you can't demand
sexual favors

595
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,164
from the people in your employ?

596
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:28,499
Unharassed workers

597
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:29,958
are productive workers.

598
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,752
So... what are you going to do
with the bar?!

599
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:34,004
Sell it!

600
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:35,755
What would I want with it
anymore?

601
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:38,175
I'll give you
5,000 bars of latinum

602
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:39,801
and not one slip more.

603
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,303
That's reasonable.

604
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:43,263
It is?

605
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:47,142
I'm telling you, Rom,
our people have lost their way.

606
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,269
I just happen to have a contract
right here.

607
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,146
I read a report that over
40 percent of the population

608
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,399
no longer believes
that you have to buy your way

609
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:55,317
into the Divine Treasury
when you die.

610
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:56,943
Can I have your thumbprint
here, please?

611
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,404
They don't teach children

612
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:00,364
the Rules of
Acquisition anymore!

613
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:03,283
And another print here.

614
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,244
There's a disease...

615
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,454
spreading
through Ferengi society.

616
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,790
It's making us soft.

617
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,043
(<i> thumbprint registers</i> )

618
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:15,045
The 5,000 has been transferred
to your account.

619
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:16,922
It was a pleasure
doing business with you.

620
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:18,591
5,000?

621
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:20,842
I thought you were going to hold
me up for at least eight.

622
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:23,095
I didn't even haggle with you.

623
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,221
I know!

624
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:26,139
It really threw me off.

625
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,349
What's wrong with me?

626
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:28,392
Don't worry, Brother.

627
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:30,060
You're going to be so rich

628
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,605
what's a few thousand
bars of latinum?

629
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:34,398
I've been infected, too.

630
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:37,276
I haven't raised prices
in months.

631
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:38,985
I've even been considering

632
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:41,321
letting the dabo girls
keep most of their tips.

633
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,156
I've gone soft!

634
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,075
I kind of like you better
this way.

635
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:46,619
I don't...

636
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:49,496
and I'm going to do
something about it.

637
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,834
This disease
has got to be stopped

638
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:57,837
before it destroys everything
Ferenginar stands for.

639
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,923
If Zek wants me to be Nagus

640
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,841
he's going to have
to let me do things

641
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:04,470
my way, or else...

642
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:07,306
I'll turn down the job!

643
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:08,932
Are you serious?!

644
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,643
You bet I am.

645
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:12,686
But being Nagus
will make you rich.

646
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:14,313
I don't care.

647
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:17,483
I won't preside over the demise
of Ferengi civilization.

648
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:18,858
Not me!

649
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:21,987
The line has to be drawn here!

650
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,990
This far and no further!

651
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:35,584
This way.

652
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,919
He's been in there too long.

653
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,672
Something's wrong.

654
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:42,549
You there. Stop.

655
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,217
Let me see
your work order.

656
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,345
But I showed it to you
on the way in.

657
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:49,973
This has not been
approved by the First.

658
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,643
(<i> laughing</i> ):
Ah! Yes.

659
00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:53,811
I can explain that.

660
00:30:53,811 --> 00:30:55,270
How much time?

661
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:59,274
The detonator only had
a three-minute delay.

662
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,109
The bomb could go off
any second now.

663
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:10,118
GARAK (<i> faintly</i> ):
Gentlemen, this is ridiculous.

664
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,162
Come on, Garak.

665
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,040
We have to do something.

666
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:20,546
I don't know why you're making
such a fuss over this.

667
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:21,963
I have a busy repair schedule

668
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,465
and I can't stand here
all night...

669
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:27,427
You will wait here
till the First arrives.

670
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:28,928
GARAK:
And how long
will that be?

671
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,263
You will wait!

672
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:32,932
DAMAR:
You! Jem'Hadar!

673
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:37,062
Who are you to treat
a Cardassian citizen like that?

674
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:41,525
It's him-- Damar!

675
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:42,693
Hold him here.

676
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:47,155
Surrender yourself, or die.

677
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,366
I choose neither.

678
00:31:51,702 --> 00:31:53,328
(<i> yelling</i> )

679
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,038
Back, get back!

680
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,833
(<i> explosions and screaming</i> )

681
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,140
(<i> coughing</i> )

682
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,272
It's Damar.

683
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,315
It's Damar!

684
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,234
He's alive!

685
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:28,154
Citizens of Cardassia, hear me.

686
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:32,200
The Dominion told you that
the rebellion has been crushed.

687
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,327
What you have seen here today

688
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:37,372
proves that that is
yet another lie.

689
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:40,125
Our fight for freedom continues

690
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:43,462
but it will take place here
in the streets.

691
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:47,507
I call on Cardassians everywhere
to rise up.

692
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:50,761
Rise up and join me.

693
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:53,472
I need you to be my army.

694
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:57,434
If we stand together,
nothing can oppose us.

695
00:32:57,434 --> 00:33:01,605
Freedom is ours for the taking!

696
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:03,398
Freedom!

697
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,317
Freedom!
Freedom!

698
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:08,654
(<i> all yelling</i> ):
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

699
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:10,697
Freedom! Freedom!

700
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,074
(<i> yelling continues</i> )

701
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:20,248
(<i> chanting</i> ):
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

702
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:32,678
Good morning.

703
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:34,262
Good morning.

704
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,350
(<i> chuckling</i> )

705
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,351
What?

706
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:40,644
What are you smiling at?

707
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:42,228
You know,
I was thinking.

708
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:43,522
If it hadn't been

709
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,357
for our little talk
the other day

710
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:47,651
we'd probably be
just standing here

711
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:49,068
staring at our shoes.

712
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,362
No, not a chance.

713
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,489
I'd have turned
and walked the other way

714
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:53,866
as soon as I saw you.

715
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:56,117
I'm glad we've got
it all behind us.

716
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,661
Me, too.

717
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:02,207
Excuse me.

718
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:27,649
Huh. I guess they
worked it out.

719
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:45,083
It always brings
a tear to my eye

720
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,293
to see a Nagus
pass his staff

721
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:48,587
to a successor.

722
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,129
(<i> chuckling</i> )

723
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:55,134
It's a privilege to witness
such a historic moment.

724
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:56,595
Just wait and see.

725
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,847
It's going to be more
historic than you think.

726
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:00,432
They're here!

727
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:03,435
There you are, my boy.

728
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:04,477
I have...

729
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:07,439
something for you.

730
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:08,941
Not so fast, Zek.

731
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:10,400
We need to talk.

732
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,652
I knew you were going
to make this difficult.

733
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,738
My mind is made up, Quark.

734
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:16,281
Whining and complaining

735
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:17,699
won't do anything.

736
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,409
I won't have anything to do

737
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:21,870
with what you're doing
to our once proud civilization.

738
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,414
A man can only
be pushed so far.

739
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:25,958
If you want me to be Nagus

740
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:27,626
you're going to have
to let me do things my way.

741
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,588
Who wants you
to be Nagus?

742
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:35,092
Out of the way, Quark.

743
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:39,262
Congratulations, Rom.

744
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:42,682
You're going to make
a fine Nagus.

745
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:45,393
I am?

746
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,979
What's wrong?

747
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:48,063
You seemed so happy

748
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:50,023
when I talked to you
the other day.

749
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:51,524
I did?

750
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:52,567
That was me.

751
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,277
You?!

752
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:58,323
Oh. I thought
I was talking to Rom.

753
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:00,241
Must have been all the static.

754
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,201
Glad we cleared
that up.

755
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,413
This is insane.

756
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,206
You actually want

757
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:09,250
<i>Rom</i> to be Nagus?

758
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,169
It was my idea.

759
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,545
Figures.

760
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:14,547
He's an idiot.

761
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:17,592
You've always
underestimated
your brother.

762
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:18,635
Shh!

763
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:21,054
A new Ferenginar

764
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:26,685
needs a new kind of Nagus--
a kinder, gentler Nagus--

765
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:27,727
(<i> disgusted sigh</i> )

766
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,395
and that's you, my boy.

767
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:31,898
It's a great
responsibility

768
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:35,193
to stand at the bow
of the Ferengi ship of state.

769
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:38,071
A Nagus has to navigate

770
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:41,407
the waters of
the Great Material

771
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:44,161
Continuum,
avoid the Shoals

772
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:45,996
of Bankruptcy

773
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:49,624
and seek the
Strong Winds

774
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,250
of Prosperity.

775
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:58,675
I'll do the best I can.

776
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:03,763
May I be the first
to offer my congratulations?

777
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,060
LEETA:
Oh, Rom!

778
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:10,562
Way to go, Dad.

779
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:11,730
(<i> laughing</i> )

780
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,191
All right, you want Rom?

781
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:16,317
You can have him.

782
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,111
In fact, you deserve him.

783
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:21,280
He's perfect for this new
workers' paradise of yours.

784
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,118
He can save the environment
and levy all the taxes he wants.

785
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:28,413
He's not taking
it very well.

786
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:30,165
In fact, as far
as I'm concerned...

787
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:36,171
the Ferenginar that I knew
doesn't exist anymore.

788
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:40,133
No... I take that back.

789
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:44,679
It<i> will</i> exist,
right here in this bar.

790
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:47,724
This establishment

791
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:52,104
will be the last outpost
of what made Ferenginar great--

792
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:54,397
the unrelenting lust

793
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:55,774
for profit!

794
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:59,111
Broik, water the drinks!

795
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:02,572
M'Pella, rig the dabo table!

796
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:06,743
Rom... I want
to buy back the bar.

797
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:08,411
That's all right, Brother.

798
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:09,704
I'll give it to you.

799
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,581
I suppose you're going to let me

800
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:13,666
keep the 5,000 bars
of latinum, too.

801
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,501
You're my brother.

802
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,295
And you're an idiot.

803
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:20,673
But I love you.

804
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,677
Congratulations.

805
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:28,890
You're the perfect Nagus
for this new Ferenginar.

806
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:32,727
Are you<i> sure</i> we picked
the right brother?

807
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:35,105
Come, my dear.

808
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:37,941
Risa's waiting.

809
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:39,776
(<i> Zek laughing</i> )

810
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:41,319
Good luck, kid!

811
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,029
You're going
to need it.

812
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,449
I'm proud of you, son.

813
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,912
Let's go, Zekkie.

814
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:57,127
You know... I<i> could</i> use
a financial advisor.

815
00:38:57,127 --> 00:38:59,796
No kidding, but it's
not going to be me.

816
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:01,840
I know someone
who's available.

817
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,508
Forget it!

818
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:06,052
Not so hasty-- let him
give you a pedicure first.

819
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,680
Now, if you'll
excuse me

820
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,765
I've got to get
back to work.

821
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:13,893
There's money
to be made.

822
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:18,023
How can I serve you, my...

823
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:27,949
Wow.

824
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,332
According to our
intelligence reports

825
00:39:35,332 --> 00:39:37,250
the Dominion has
withdrawn completely

826
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:40,461
from Klingon, Federation,
and Romulan space.

827
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,505
They seem to be forming
a new defensive perimeter

828
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,883
within Cardassian territory.

829
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,509
They must know
we've developed

830
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,636
a countermeasure
to the Breen weapon.

831
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,763
That would be my guess.

832
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,515
There are advantages
to falling back.

833
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,100
They shorten
their supply lines

834
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,476
while forcing us
to lengthen ours.

835
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,270
ROSS:
And with a smaller
perimeter

836
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,272
they're less vulnerable
to hit-and-run attacks.

837
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:00,523
It would take
a major offensive

838
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,192
to break through
their lines.

839
00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:03,943
At a cost of
thousands of ships.

840
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:06,112
The wiser course
would be to simply

841
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:08,489
contain them within
their perimeter.

842
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,408
That's what
they're hoping we'll do--

843
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,952
to give them time
to rebuild their forces.

844
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,412
He's right.

845
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,289
We have them
on the defensive.

846
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:18,166
We should hit them
with everything we've got.

847
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:19,500
Breaking through that line

848
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,420
would be a very ugly,
very bloody job.

849
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,006
If we do nothing

850
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:27,884
the Dominion could sit
behind that perimeter

851
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:30,387
for the next five years
rearming themselves

852
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:33,431
and when they're ready
to come out, God help us all.

853
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:38,019
The Klingon Empire
votes to<i> attack</i> now

854
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:40,146
before they have
time to recover.

855
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:45,402
Considering the
alternatives...

856
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:48,196
I'm afraid
I have to concur.

857
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:53,326
Very well.

858
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,580
Then it's settled.

859
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,498
We attack.

860
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:13,596
You're up late.

861
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:21,896
You waiting for me?

862
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:28,236
What's wrong?

863
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,117
I'm pregnant.

864
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:38,537
Are you sure?

865
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:41,124
Of course I'm sure.

866
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:46,296
Oh.

867
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:47,588
Baby, I...

868
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,548
I didn't mean...

869
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,760
A... a baby.

870
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,806
You and me....

871
00:41:56,806 --> 00:41:59,267
a... wow.

872
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:00,310
Surprise.

873
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:02,228
"Surprise" is right.

874
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:04,605
Uh... how did... you...?

875
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,606
One of us...

876
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,108
One of us...

877
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:10,069
forgot our injection
last month.

878
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:14,282
(<i> sighs</i> )

879
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:18,244
Julian reminded me of that.

880
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:21,373
It's just that the way things
have been going on...

881
00:42:21,373 --> 00:42:23,291
You don't have to apologize.

882
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:25,001
I'm not!

883
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:26,378
Are you kidding?

884
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:29,881
This... this is wonderful.

885
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:33,301
I'm glad you think so.

886
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:36,095
But you don't.

887
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:40,225
I just keep thinking
about the Prophets.

888
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:42,060
They warned you

889
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,521
that marrying me
would bring you sorrow.

890
00:42:44,521 --> 00:42:46,689
Kasidy, we have
been through this.

891
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:51,403
I know we have, and I...
I know that we said

892
00:42:51,403 --> 00:42:53,654
we wouldn't let the Prophets
run our lives

893
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,073
but that was...

894
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:56,074
(<i> sighs</i> )

895
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:58,576
that was before this.

896
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,995
What if...

897
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:05,166
what if they were trying
to tell you something?

898
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:07,419
That something would
happen to our baby?

899
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:09,170
Shh.

900
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:18,137
Nothing... is going
to happen to our baby.

901
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:20,473
Are you sure?

902
00:43:20,473 --> 00:43:22,600
(<i> whispering</i> ):
I am the Emissary
