1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:06,005
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 50049.3.</i>

2
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:08,843
<i>We're conducting a mineral</i>
<i>survey of Torga IV,</i>

3
00:00:08,843 --> 00:00:10,970
<i>an uninhabited planet</i>
<i>in the Gamma Quadrant</i>

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,931
<i>believed to contain</i>
<i>vast deposits of cormaline.</i>

5
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:16,934
<i>Our mission is to</i>
<i>determine the feasibility</i>
<i>of establishing</i>

6
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:20,103
<i>a mining operation</i>
<i>on the planet's surface.</i>

7
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,898
Hey, Muniz.

8
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,610
What do you think of this?

9
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:32,324
It's a class-5
pyroclastic debris and ash.

10
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:34,493
Same morphology we've seen
all the way up, sir.

11
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:37,371
How many times do
I have to tell you to
stop calling me "sir"?

12
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:40,541
I'm not an officer.
Well, you know
more than they do.

13
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,877
Well, I wouldn't go
that far. But I do
know more than you,

14
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:45,170
so listen to me while I try
and teach you something.

15
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,673
This morphology is
not exactly the same.

16
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:50,926
These deposits are
more highly eroded.

17
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:52,594
So?

18
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:56,724
So... they're
different, that's all.

19
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:58,517
Just thought I'd point
that out to you.

20
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,060
I see.

21
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,729
I thought maybe
you just stopped

22
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:02,938
to catch your breath.

23
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:05,524
Me, out of breath?

24
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:07,317
I was climbing
mountains in Ireland

25
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,819
before you were born.

26
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:10,696
You mean "hills,"
don't you?

27
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:12,990
They have gently sloping
hills in Ireland.

28
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,115
No mountains.

29
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:16,994
But what do I know?

30
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:20,080
After all, you're
the mountain man...

31
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,207
an old mountain man.

32
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:25,335
You know something, Muniz?

33
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,713
You're due for a transfer.

34
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:30,007
How does waste extraction sound?

35
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:37,096
How's it going, Chief?
Fine, sir.

36
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:39,349
We finished the survey
of the south slope.

37
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,435
What do you think, old man?

38
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,270
Is this place
worth mining?

39
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,647
Absolutely. The cormaline
is only a few hundred meters

40
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,900
below the surface, and if
my readings are correct,

41
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,986
it's one of the richest
veins I've ever seen.

42
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:52,696
Mr. Worf?

43
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,907
Strategically,
the planet's location

44
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:56,700
would make it difficult
to maintain

45
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,493
adequate supply lines,
but not impossible.

46
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:01,246
Hoya to Captain Sisko.
Go ahead.

47
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:04,458
Sir, our sensors have detected
a ship dropping out of warp.

48
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,086
What kind of ship?
I'm not sure, sir.

49
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:08,921
I can't get
a good reading on it.

50
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:10,505
Plasma leaks
from its warp nacelles

51
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:11,840
are disrupting our sensors.

52
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,801
Whatever it is, it's fallen

53
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:15,928
into the gravitational pull
of the planet.

54
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:18,764
It should enter the atmosphere
near your position.

55
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,395
Sir, the ship
withstood the impact.

56
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,564
Survivors?
I can't determine that.

57
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,275
We're having trouble penetrating
the hull with our sensors.

58
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,193
Beam us directly
to the crash site.

59
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,166
A warship.

60
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,085
A Jem'Hadar warship.

61
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:02,343
DAX:
No hull breach.

62
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,888
The only damage I could find
was a crushed guidance thruster

63
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,598
if that's what it is.

64
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:09,643
O'BRIEN:
Captain, I think we have
an access point.

65
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,186
I'll be right there.

66
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:12,687
So, my young friend

67
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,564
what do you think
we're looking at?

68
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,399
An upside-down ship.

69
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,610
(<i> chuckling</i> ):
An airlock?

70
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,821
A maintenance hatch?
Maybe.

71
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,031
But this is a warship.

72
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,784
On a warship, you want
a big access point

73
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,620
on the belly to...
land troops.

74
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,413
There's hope
for you yet, Muniz.

75
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,414
Can you open it, Chief?

76
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,540
I think so.

77
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,585
(<i> mechanical clanking</i> )

78
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:41,175
Mr. Worf, take the point.
T'Lor, you stay put.

79
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,890
(<i> quietly</i> ):
Commander, secure the area.

80
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,212
(<i> creaking</i> )

81
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:28,740
(<i> gasps</i> )

82
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,469
These men didn't die
in the crash.

83
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,763
They've been dead for hours.

84
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:54,057
What killed them?

85
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:57,018
Massive osteonecrosis.

86
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,520
Every bone in their
body's been shattered.

87
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,149
Sounds like
inertial damper failure.

88
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,401
The ship accelerated...

89
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:07,112
people were thrown
into the bulkheads.

90
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:10,240
Nobody was alive when
this ship hit the planet,

91
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,367
yet it survived the impact.

92
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:15,245
Whoever designed this baby
knew what they were doing.

93
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,374
No viewscreen, no chairs...

94
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,460
O'BRIEN:
No EPS conduits.

95
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,045
No microfusion initiators.

96
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,797
No power converters--

97
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,674
at least none
that I can find.

98
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,677
I suppose getting
this ship up and running
won't be easy.

99
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,013
I can't even determine
if it has a warp drive.

100
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,556
I wonder if this is what all
the Jem'Hadar ships are like.

101
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:38,393
The bigger question is:
What's a Jem'Hadar ship

102
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:40,770
doing all the way out here?
We're at least three weeks away

103
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,314
from the nearest
Dominion outpost.

104
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:45,192
Captain, there are
29 other bodies.

105
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,694
No survivors.

106
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:51,531
Can we use the runabout's
tractor beam to haul
this thing into orbit?

107
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:55,702
This would be the greatest
intelligence find
in the last ten years.

108
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,372
We're not going to leave
it here to rust.
What do you say, Chief?

109
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:00,707
Well, we're not
going to haul it out
with a runabout.

110
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,835
Then we need something
with a little more muscle.

111
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,509
BASHIR:
We'll let the Major
be the judge of that.

112
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:13,928
What I'm saying is,
if you're going
to prosecute<i> me,</i>

113
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:18,141
I demand that you prosecute
my coconspirator.
I'm not a conspirator.

114
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,809
What would you call
yourself, Doctor?

115
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,644
An idiot.
I'll buy that.

116
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,522
For asking your help
in the first place.

117
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:25,773
Would someone please tell
me what's going on here?

118
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:29,361
Quark brought aboard a shipment
of Regalian fleaspiders

119
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:31,112
without an import permit.

120
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,572
He asked for them!

121
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,199
The spiders were
for you, Major.

122
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,867
I can synthesize a drug
from their venom

123
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,744
which should improve
your circulation.

124
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,787
But I didn't know
I needed a permit
to import them.

125
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:42,082
So what's the problem?
Fill out the paperwork.

126
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,708
ODO:
It's not
that simple anymore.

127
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,378
It seems that Quark
took the opportunity

128
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:49,548
to import illegal
Regalian liquid crystals

129
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:51,716
along with the fleaspiders.

130
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,553
The crystals are
a highly intoxicating

131
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:57,305
and sometimes dangerous
aphrodisiac.

132
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,766
What's love
without danger?

133
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:03,103
I don't have time for this.
I just spoke with Captain Sisko.

134
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,813
They found a crashed Jem'Hadar
ship in the Gamma Quadrant.

135
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:08,608
They need
the<i> Defiant</i> right away.
I'll be back in about a week.

136
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,445
When do we leave?
<i>I'm</i> leaving right away.

137
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:15,156
I'd say<i> you</i> have some
legal problems to work out.

138
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,117
Gentlemen...

139
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,169
O'BRIEN:
It's embedded about 90
meters into the rock.

140
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,922
If I can shake it loose by
firing the main thrusters

141
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:33,758
hauling it out of here
will be a lot easier.
There's a problem?

142
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,427
Well, to fire
the main thrusters,

143
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,596
I need to calibrate
the plasma injectors.

144
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:40,848
So far, I can't get a
grip on the ion regulator.

145
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:43,184
You want to try a hyper-spanner
above the matrix?

146
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,769
It might open it up a bit.

147
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,441
Maybe we won't send you
to waste extraction
after all, Muniz.

148
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:50,984
WORF:
Captain...

149
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,402
we buried the bodies

150
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,154
on the other side
of that ridge.

151
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:57,073
The DNA readings--
42 Jem'Hadar, one Vorta.

152
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,117
Hoya to Captain Sisko.
Go ahead.

153
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:01,620
A Jem'Hadar warship
has just dropped out of warp.

154
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,371
Break orbit
and get out of sight.

155
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,999
They've locked phasers on us.
Hard to port!

156
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,169
Shields are down!
Engage warp!

157
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,146
(<i> screams</i> )

158
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:33,067
Inside! We don't stand
a chance in the open.

159
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,851
We may not be safe in here.

160
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,396
The Jem'Hadar can transport
through just about anything.

161
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:16,403
(<i> footsteps</i> )

162
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,081
Why do they not come?

163
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,457
Give them time.

164
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,543
Watch our backs,
Commander.

165
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:33,836
We're moving to
the Command Center.

166
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,716
Can you walk?

167
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:39,175
Faster than you can.

168
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:55,358
Let me take a look at this.

169
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:56,817
I'm all right, Captain.

170
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,570
I've had worse
transporter burns.

171
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:59,946
Where's the medkit?

172
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,864
DAX:
T'Lor had it.

173
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,367
I don't need it, sir.
I'll be all right.

174
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:05,784
We have to stop
the bleeding.

175
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:07,495
I'll take care of that.

176
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,083
(<i> groans</i> )

177
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,085
Transporter burn.

178
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:16,003
"I'm all right, Captain."

179
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,839
Always kissing up
to the officers
aren't you, Muniz?

180
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,799
Just following your example.

181
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,260
You're my hero.

182
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,262
(<i> cloth rips</i> )
Hey!

183
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:26,055
I have to get to the wound.

184
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,933
But this is
my best uniform.

185
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,185
It's the only one
that fits right.

186
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,772
Don't worry.
When we get back,

187
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:36,441
we'll have Garak
make you a new one.

188
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,487
How long till
the<i> Defiant</i>
gets here?

189
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,281
Two and a half days.

190
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,577
Don't worry,<i> Jefe.</i>

191
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,621
I'll get you through this.

192
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:54,501
I feel better already.

193
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:57,253
We've only got one
portable generator.

194
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,963
The rest are at base camp.

195
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:05,512
Looks like you need
a new bandage, Enrique.

196
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:06,638
(<i> equipment powering up</i> )

197
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,055
Ah. Thanks, Chief.

198
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,559
I'll take it
from here, Commander.

199
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:18,525
Quique, do me a favor.

200
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,985
Please...

201
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,446
stop bleeding before
I run out of clothes.

202
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:26,073
I'll do the best I can.

203
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,952
What do you make
of this, old man?

204
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:36,668
My guess, it's some kind
of virtual sensory display.

205
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:39,420
The Jem'Hadar equivalent
of our viewscreen?

206
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,631
There are only
two headsets.

207
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:45,468
One for the Vorta and one
for the Jem'Hadar First.

208
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:48,346
Guess they're the only ones
who get to see what's
going on outside.

209
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:51,432
Captain Sisko,
my name is Kilana.

210
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:55,395
I'm the Vorta in charge
of the Jem'Hadar troops
surrounding you.

211
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,647
If you touch
the triangular green panel

212
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,649
on any of
the control consoles,

213
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,442
you'll be able to speak to me.

214
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,821
They know your name.

215
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,615
They always seem to be
one step ahead of us.

216
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:14,622
(<i> beeps</i> )

217
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,208
This is Captain Sisko.

218
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:20,253
Captain, I'm so happy
to hear your voice.

219
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,797
I heard there were
some casualties among your crew

220
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:25,383
and I feared
you may have been one of them.

221
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:29,429
Thank you for your concern.
What do you want?

222
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,724
To talk. I think it would be
in everyone's best interest

223
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:34,642
if you and I met face-to-face

224
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:38,271
and discussed the situation,
like reasonable people.

225
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,440
I can be reasonable.

226
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,982
So I've heard.

227
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:44,569
One escort each.
Agreed?

228
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,909
Agreed.

229
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:57,081
Your photograph
doesn't do you justice.

230
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,876
You're quite
striking in person.

231
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:04,004
Uh, look, I'm a little busy,
so let's skip the flattery.

232
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:08,551
Weyoun's report
on you was right.

233
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,804
You are direct.

234
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,179
I like that.

235
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,974
So, let me cut
to the chase.

236
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,226
I believe that is
the correct expression.

237
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,729
This is our ship.
We want it back.

238
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:22,398
<i>Was</i> your ship.
Now it's mine.

239
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,691
Oh.

240
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,276
Captain, I'm...

241
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:26,861
I'm a little disappointed.

242
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,905
That's the attitude of a thief,

243
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:32,325
not a Starfleet Captain
with a reputation for integrity.

244
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,994
This is clearly our property.

245
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,163
What gives you any claim to it?

246
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,833
An old legal tradition--
salvage rights.

247
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,669
We found a wrecked ship
and a dead crew,

248
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,211
and we found it first.

249
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,213
A very
interesting
position.

250
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:49,717
But I'm afraid the Dominion
doesn't recognize that...

251
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,594
tradition.

252
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,763
What may be
even more to the point,

253
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:57,350
we have you completely
surrounded and outnumbered.

254
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,855
Would you like
something to eat, Captain?

255
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,982
Or maybe something to drink?

256
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:26,754
These are<i> q'lavas--</i>
a personal favorite.

257
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:30,383
They're not poisonous, if
that's what you're thinking.

258
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,426
Not to you, anyway.

259
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:38,850
I hope you're not
teaching Jake to be
this suspicious, Benjamin.

260
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,393
Or do you prefer Ben?

261
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:41,853
"Captain" will be fine.

262
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:44,397
I'm sure it's my fault
that we seem unable

263
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:48,150
to establish an understanding
between us, Captain.

264
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,571
I'm sorry I'm not more
experienced in these matters.

265
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:54,323
This is my first mission
outside the Dominion

266
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:58,494
and my very first dealing
with anyone from the Federation.

267
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,706
I know you have
no reason to trust me,

268
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:05,710
but I hope you'll at least try
to consider my offer
with an open mind.

269
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,086
I'm listening.

270
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,922
If you'll leave
our ship,

271
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:10,590
I'll take you and your crew

272
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,258
back to your space station--
unharmed.

273
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,427
Our accommodations
may not be lavish,

274
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,429
but I promise
you'll all be well cared for

275
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,056
especially your wounded.

276
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:20,349
If you think I'm going
to deliver my people

277
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,936
into your hands
without a fight,

278
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:26,105
then this really must be
your first mission.

279
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,609
(<i> moans</i> )

280
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:35,406
(<i> beeping</i> )

281
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:38,325
I'd love to know how
the Captain's doing.

282
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,954
Any chance you can get
this thing working?

283
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:44,415
Not right away.
I'm still trying to get
the main power grid on line.

284
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,500
(<i> clicking, soft thumps</i> )

285
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,877
What's that?

286
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:06,604
(<i> soft ticking</i> )

287
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:09,023
That wasn't there before.
You sure?

288
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:10,316
Positive.

289
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:17,991
It's some kind
of sensor device.

290
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:20,868
Whatever it is, it doesn't
look too friendly.

291
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:27,959
Captain.

292
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:29,460
They're in the ship.

293
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,393
I knew it.

294
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,813
You've been goldbricking
all along.

295
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:52,358
Like I said,
you taught me everything I know.

296
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,778
Whatever this sensor
was supposed to do,

297
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:58,156
it did it and
then shut down.

298
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:00,199
Probably
a surveillance device.

299
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,409
To find out how many
of us there are...

300
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,120
how many weapons
we have.

301
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,873
(<i> Muniz groans</i> )
I don't think so.

302
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,541
They seem
to know all that already.

303
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,793
But it doesn't make sense.
If he had a rifle,

304
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:13,880
O'Brien and I would be dead,
but all he had was a knife.

305
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,090
And why send only
one Jem'Hadar?

306
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,552
(<i> sighs</i> ):
There's something
about this ship,

307
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:23,430
something so important that
they won't risk destroying it
in a full-on assault.

308
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,308
If that is true,
then we must find
out what it is.

309
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,477
Captain, the first thing
we need to do

310
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,604
is make a structural scan
of the ship.

311
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,106
Make our own blueprints.

312
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:34,692
Get started.

313
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:36,152
(<i> groaning</i> )

314
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:42,575
I'm leaking like a ruptured
plasma conduit, aren't I, sir?

315
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,035
It's not that bad.

316
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:46,120
You're lying.

317
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,372
What makes you say that?

318
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:51,333
I called you "sir"
and you didn't even flinch.

319
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,546
I must be dying.

320
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,384
Now you listen
to me, Quique.

321
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,429
You're not dying unless
I say you're dying,

322
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,932
and I say you're
going to make it.

323
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,982
How are you doing, Muniz?

324
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:18,277
We seem to be having
a difference of opinion
on that one, sir.

325
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:22,198
But I would like
to file a complaint.

326
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,867
The nurses around here
are all thumbs.

327
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,663
You watch it,

328
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:32,250
or I'll tighten this bandage
like a tourniquet.

329
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,627
And as for bedside manner,

330
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:37,713
I've known nicer voles.
Certainly prettier ones.

331
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:41,467
You keep moving around,
you won't need any nurse.

332
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,385
Listen to the
Chief, Muniz.

333
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,929
Save your strength.

334
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,612
I'm worried about
him, Captain.

335
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,739
I can't stop
the bleeding.

336
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,450
Maybe it's a side effect
of the Jem'Hadar weapons.

337
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,036
They must leave some kind
of anticoagulant.

338
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:12,623
If I don't get him to
a medical bay soon, he's
not going to make it.

339
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:15,835
None of us are going
to make it if we don't
get this ship operational.

340
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,628
I need to get
the power grid functioning

341
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:19,379
and the aft
turret weapon on line.

342
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,965
You're the only one
who can do that.

343
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:23,301
I'll take care of Muniz.
Captain--

344
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:24,885
You have your orders.

345
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,096
Yes, sir.

346
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,060
(<i> sighs</i> )

347
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,696
Chief...

348
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,240
structurally,
a lot about this ship's design

349
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,576
matches the other
Jem'Hadar warships we've seen.

350
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:52,246
But there are
significant differences.

351
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:55,541
There are many systems
that we are completely
unfamiliar with.

352
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:58,336
I can start to restore
power to the systems
one at a time.

353
00:22:58,336 --> 00:23:00,296
That'll give us a
chance to test them

354
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:01,755
and establish
their functions,

355
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,257
but it's going
to take awhile.

356
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:05,634
How long?
I wish I knew.

357
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,303
Well, you can do it, Chief.

358
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:09,263
I don't think
a ship's been invented

359
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:10,973
that you can't figure out.

360
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:19,982
Muniz is strong.
He'll make it.

361
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,901
No. He will not.

362
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,986
He will not see tomorrow.

363
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:26,239
You keep that
to yourself.

364
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,490
I don't want him to
hear that kind of talk.

365
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,951
It does no good
to shield him from the truth.

366
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,578
Let him prepare for death.

367
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:34,038
The hell I will.

368
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:36,290
His only hope is
to keep fighting.

369
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:38,167
If he gives up, it's over.

370
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:41,419
It was over the moment
he was shot by the Jem'Hadar.

371
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:43,672
Now, you listen to me.

372
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,507
That boy's life
is in our hands,

373
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,760
and I won't let anybody
give up on him.

374
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,557
Worf, what do you say
we go look

375
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,935
at that ion exchange matrix
we found?

376
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:58,229
And on the way,
maybe we can discuss

377
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:00,356
some of the finer points
of diplomacy.

378
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,279
KILANA:
Captain Sisko.

379
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,406
Captain, you're annoyed with me.

380
00:24:08,406 --> 00:24:10,032
I understand.

381
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:12,952
You feel betrayed,
and with good reason

382
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,995
but I really think
we should talk.

383
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,956
If it will make you feel
any better,

384
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,999
I'll come unarmed
and without an escort,

385
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,668
but I won't hold you
to the same restrictions.

386
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:29,718
If you have something
to say, say it.

387
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:34,472
Sending the Jem'Hadar
into the ship was a mistake,

388
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:36,016
and I apologize.

389
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,893
I trust no one was hurt,

390
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,895
but what choice did I have?

391
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,981
Just like you have to protect
the lives of your men,

392
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,524
I have to protect our...

393
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,152
property.

394
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:47,736
But I do hope

395
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,156
we can put that behind us

396
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:51,740
and move on.

397
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,700
Move on to what?

398
00:24:57,121 --> 00:25:00,707
I'm sure it's obvious by now
there's something
in the ship we want.

399
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:04,086
You allow me and my men
to retrieve the item,

400
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:08,548
we'll leave.
You can keep the ship.

401
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:10,176
How about this?

402
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:12,011
You tell me what it is you want

403
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:13,887
and I'll bring it out to you.

404
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,681
I'm afraid I can't do that.

405
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,891
Don't you trust me?

406
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:21,437
I'd like to, Captain,

407
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,230
but I can't.

408
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,816
Not under these circumstances.

409
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:28,652
There's simply...

410
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,779
too much at stake for us.

411
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,865
We've got a lot at stake, too.

412
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:35,701
I won't risk
the lives of my crew.

413
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:40,206
Well, it seems
we're approaching an impasse.

414
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:43,417
We've already arrived.

415
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,086
How unfortunate.

416
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,882
The negotiations have ended.

417

could have gone better.
(<i> beeping</i> )

422
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:31,257
All the ship's systems
are shutting down, Captain.

(<i> groaning</i> )

424
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:35,469
I need to know what's
going on out there.

425
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:37,179
Chief, get me some
sensor readings.

426
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,432
Dax, take care
of Muniz.

427
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:44,895
(<i> gasping</i> )

428
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:47,731
I can't feel my legs.

429
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,900
Don't worry,
they're there.

430
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,194
I managed to bypass
the virtual display interface

431
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:55,030
and hook up a tricorder
to the ship's sensor array.

432
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:59,617
Those are ultritium concussion
shells they're detonating.

433
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:01,954
Without shields, a direct
hit would destroy us.

434
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:04,331
I do not believe
they are trying
to hit us.

435
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:07,126
Their targeting
systems cannot be
that ineffective.

436
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,586
They're trying
to rattle us.

437
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:10,421
(<i> explosion</i> )

438
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:14,049
And we're not going
to let them do that.

439
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:18,095
The Vorta doesn't want the ship.

440
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:20,097
She wants something aboard it.

441
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:21,681
Any idea what?

442
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:23,392
It could be anything...

443
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:26,061
encoding device,
guidance system...

444
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,938
Maybe she lost an earring.

445
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:30,524
Whatever it is,
it's keeping us alive.

446
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:31,775
Find it!

Chief...

448
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,282
I need that weapon.

449
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:40,700
I'll still have to charge
the emitter arrays.

450
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,869
Stay on it.

Nice work,
Mr. O'Brien.

454
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,636
But the bad news is...

455
00:27:58,636 --> 00:28:00,429
the turret is stuck.

456
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:03,015
You can only fire
in one direction.

457
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:05,351
Maybe we'll get lucky
and the Jem'Hadar

458
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:07,102
will pick that place
to stand.

Yeah, that was
a good one.

480
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:19,007
I'll say one thing
for the Jem'Hadar.
They travel light.

No cargo, no storage

There may be some encoded

has been randomized.

In other words,
they're blank.

As far as
I can tell.

488

What is it?

497
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,590
It may have been
the Vorta's computer console.

498
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,550
I found it in one of
the upper compartments,

499
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:04,470
but the power grid is off-line
in that part of the ship.

500
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,722
So you ripped it
out of the wall.

you would consider that option.

00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,708
I'm not some
blood-thirsty Klingon

522
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:17,835
looking for an excuse
to murder my friend.

523
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:21,505
That's enough.
No.

524
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:26,009
You are just
another weak human
afraid to face death.

525
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,427
(<i> yells</i> )

526
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,262
I said that's enough!

527
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:30,930
You're Starfleet officers.

528
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,808
Now, start acting like it!

529
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:36,520
Tough guys--
a little pressure
and they buckle.

530
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,649
Dax, maybe you haven't noticed,

531
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:42,609
but no one's laughing.

532
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:51,410
Now, I know it's hot.
We're filthy. Tired.

533
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:55,288
And we've got ten isotons
of explosives going off outside.

534
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:58,876
But we will never
get out of this if we don't
pull it together

535
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:00,753
and start to act
like professionals.

(<i> shuddering groan</i> )
(<i> explosion</i> )

537
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:07,217
Chief, I want that power grid
up and running.

538
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:09,636
Aye, sir.

539
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:12,806
Commander Worf, see if you
can get that turret to rotate.

540
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:14,307
Aye, sir.

541
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:17,227
(<i> explosion</i> )

542
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:19,020
Dax, search the ship

543
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,480
again and again

544
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,858
until you find
what the Vorta wants.

545
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:27,237
Yes, sir.

546
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:30,699
(<i> explosion</i> )
(<i> sighs</i> )

547
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:34,244
And you, Mr. Muniz...

548
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:36,663
your orders are...

549
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,041
to stay alive.

550
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:46,840
<i>Captain's Log,</i>

555
00:32:58,936 --> 00:33:01,647
As soon as we finish calibrating
the induction reactors,

556
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,273
we can fire up the main core.

(<i> explosion</i> )

558
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:07,235
Good, because, unless
there are any objections,

559
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,279
I'd like to get
the hell off this planet.

560
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,490
I'm for that.
Ready, Chief.

561
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,241
I could use
a couple more hours

562
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,160
to fine-tune
the magnetic flux couplers,

563
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,996
but under the circumstances,
now's as good a time as any.

564
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,666
Then let's do it.
Everyone brace yourselves.

565
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:22,876
This is going to be
a rough ride.

566
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:24,670
Commence
launch sequence.

567
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,296
Ion thrusters
fully charged.

568

Ventral impellers,
one quarter.

00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,133
Plasma compensators,
on line.

570
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,802
Thrusters to one half.

571
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:39,518
Chief, I'm getting
a low-frequency resonance
in the main reactor housing.

572
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:42,771
That's all right.
Just keep compensating
with the inertial dampers.

573
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,564
Dampers are at maximum.

574
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,149
We need more power.

575
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,276
Ventral jets to one half.

576
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,654
It's working, Captain.

577
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:53,114
These engines
just might shake us loose.

578
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:55,241
Increase power to one half.

579
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,997
Main reactor housing,
destabilizing.

00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:01,832
Reactor containment field

00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:03,750
Induction dampers
disintegrating, Captain.

582
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,878
If we don't cut power, we're
going to have a core breach.

583
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:09,422
Disengage thrusters.

584
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:10,841
Power down all systems.

(<i> explosion</i> )

586
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:19,975
How bad?

587
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:22,519
Main power grid
is completely fused.

588
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,897
Structural integrity field
has collapsed.

589
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:29,108
We'll have to wait until
the<i> Defiant</i> gets here.

590
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:31,862
She'll be able to
pull us out of here
with a tractor beam.

591
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:34,781
Which means we have 36 hours
to make repairs.

592
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:37,200
You all know what to do.

593
00:34:41,038 --> 00:34:43,373
I could really
use your help now, Quique.

(<i> explosion</i> )

595
00:35:17,074 --> 00:35:19,826
I told Muniz
he was going to make it.

596
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:23,872
That's what a Captain's
supposed to say.

(<i> explosion</i> )

598
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:30,963
I have got to get this ship
back to the station, old man.

599
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:35,425
Five people have died
on this mission.

600
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:40,513
I want to be able
to tell their families why.

It's a changeling.

(<i> squealing roar</i> )

605
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:21,847
It can't hold
its shape.

606
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,933
It's dying.

607
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,686
Then we're in trouble.

608
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:33,775
That's what the Vorta
has been looking for--
a Founder.

609
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:37,070
No wonder the Jem'Hadar
wouldn't attack.

610
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,823
They couldn't risk
killing one of
their gods.

The bombing stopped.

614
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:11,855
Prepare for an assault.
Tell Worf to man the--

615
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:14,566
Where are your soldiers?
They're dead.

616
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,818
They killed themselves.
Why?

617
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:20,780
Because they allowed
a Founder to die.

618
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,824
You should have trusted me.

619
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:26,411
How could I?!
The first word out of
your mouth was a lie!

620
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:29,873
This isn't your
first mission outside
the Dominion, is it?

621
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,877
I regret saying that,

622
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:37,338
but my offer was genuine.

623
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:40,466
All that mattered to me
was the Founder.

624
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,510
Then you should have
told me about him.

625
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,555
You might have killed him
or made him a hostage.

626
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:46,806
No.

627
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:52,145
All I wanted was the ship.

628
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:54,731
And I was willing
to let you take it.

629
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:01,196
So...

630
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,449
this is how it ends.

631
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:06,118
(<i> footsteps approaching</i> )

632
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:11,539
It's true.
The Jem'Hadar died
by their own hands.

633
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,543
Muniz...

634
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,380
the runabout crew...

635
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:23,051
your soldiers...

636
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:27,055
they'd all still be alive
if we had trusted each other.

637
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:32,477
I have no way of stopping you
from taking the ship.

638
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:35,188
All I ask is that you
allow me to remove

639
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:37,190
some of the Founder's remains.

640
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,528
Of course.

641
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:11,183
Do you have any gods,
Captain Sisko?

642
00:39:11,183 --> 00:39:15,020
There are things I believe in.

643
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,396
Duty?

644
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,649
Starfleet? The Federation?

645
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:26,239
You must be pleased
with yourself.

646
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:28,241
You have this ship
to take back to them.

647
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,912
I hope it was worth it.

648
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:35,373
So do I.

649
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,431
(<i> sighing</i> )

650
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:09,324
What did Starfleet
have to say about
our prize?

651
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:10,700
They're pleased.

652
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:14,371
That's all?
Just pleased?

653
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:16,748
<i>Very</i> pleased.

654
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,499
They're giving us all medals.

655
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,879
I'll add it
to my collection.

656
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:27,592
Starfleet Command is waiting
for my official report,

657
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:30,678
but every time I try
to get it started...

658
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:35,600
I find myself staring
at the casualty list

659
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,769
and reading
the same five names

660
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:40,105
over and over again.

661
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:42,899
T'Lor, Rooney,

662
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:47,528
Bertram, Hoya, Muniz.

663
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:51,783
It may sound cruel,
but we both know

664
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,993
that ship out there
was worth it.

665
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,912
Those five deaths

666
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:58,957
may save 5,000 lives,

667
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:01,000
or maybe even five million.

668
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,921
And if I had to make the same
trade all over again, I would.

669
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:11,010
But five people are dead.

670
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,679
Fine men and women who deserved

671
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:16,391
a lot more than to die
on some lonely planet

672
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,476
50,000 light-years
away from home!

673
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,560
(<i> bangs padd</i> )

674
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,022
When you were
at the Academy,

675
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:25,150
was Professor Somak teaching?

676
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:29,279
Moral and Ethical Issues
of Command.

677
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:32,240
I remember her favorite speech:

678
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,993
"Always maintain
emotional distance

679
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:38,496
between yourself
and those under your command."

680
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,791
It's good advice.

681
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:43,918
And I try to follow it,

682
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,921
but it's a lot more complicated
<i>outside</i> of the classroom.

683
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:53,470
Did you know
that Jake and Muniz
have the same birthday?

684
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:57,849
That<i> I</i> performed
the ceremony at Hoya's wedding?

685
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:01,978
And Rooney--
he could play the trumpet.

686
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:04,022
I heard him
at Quark's once,

687
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:06,774
and he had the people
dancing in the aisles.

688
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,193
I remember.

689
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:13,572
And you know something else
I remember about him?

690
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:19,412
How<i> proud</i> he was
to wear his uniform

691
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:24,000
and how proud he was
to serve under you.

692
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,585
The same as Hoya,

693
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:31,966
T'Lor, Bertram and Muniz.

694
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:36,388
They chose a life
in Starfleet.

695
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:40,225
They knew the risks,

696
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:42,185
and they died
fighting for something

697
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:44,270
that they believed in.

698
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,856
That doesn't make it any easier.

699
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:49,984
Maybe nothing should.

700
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:15,134
We used a phase-conjugate
graviton emitter
in the tractor beam.

701
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:18,679
That baby came out
of the rock first time.

702
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,598
You would have
loved it, Quique.

703
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,892
(<i> door opens</i> )

704
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:25,019
I did not mean to interrupt.

705
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,604
It's all right.

706
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,981
You are performing
<i>Ak'voh</i>

707
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,733
for your friend.

708
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,610
I am?

709
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,447
Yes. It's an old
Klingon tradition.

710
00:43:35,447 --> 00:43:37,740
When a warrior dies in battle,

711
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,868
his comrades stay with the body
to keep away predators.

712
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:43,788
That allows the spirit
to leave the body

713
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:47,833
when it is time to make
the long journey
to<i> Sto'Vo'Kor.</i>

714
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:50,002
It's a fine tradition.

715
00:43:57,594 --> 00:43:59,720
What are you doing?

716
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,348
We will both keep
the predators away.

717
00:44:05,435 --> 00:44:07,604
I'm sure Quique
would like that.
