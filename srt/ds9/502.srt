1
00:00:02,264 --> 00:00:06,365
Captain's Log, Stardate 50049.3.

2
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:09,173
We're conducting a mineral
survey of Torga IV

3
00:00:09,245 --> 00:00:11,512
an uninhabited planet
in the Gamma Quadrant

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,489
believed to contain
vast deposits of cormaline.

5
00:00:14,523 --> 00:00:17,519
Our mission is to determine
the feasibility of establishing

6
00:00:17,563 --> 00:00:20,559
a mining operation
on the planet's surface.

7
00:00:21,572 --> 00:00:23,064
Hey, Muniz.

8
00:00:25,648 --> 00:00:27,242
What do you think of this?

9
00:00:29,122 --> 00:00:32,584
It's a class-5
pyroclastic debris and ash.

10
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,863
Same morphology we've seen
all the way up, sir.

11
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:36,804
How many times do
I have to tell you

12
00:00:36,839 --> 00:00:38,240
to stop calling me "sir"?

13
00:00:38,276 --> 00:00:39,437
I'm not an officer.

14
00:00:39,478 --> 00:00:41,243
Well, you know more
than they do.

15
00:00:41,282 --> 00:00:42,409
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

16
00:00:42,452 --> 00:00:43,579
But I do know more than you

17
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,419
so listen to me while I try
and teach you something.

18
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:48,259
This morphology is
not exactly the same.

19
00:00:48,365 --> 00:00:50,461
These deposits are
more highly eroded.

20
00:00:50,503 --> 00:00:52,736
So?

21
00:00:52,774 --> 00:00:57,216
So... they're
different, that's all.

22
00:00:57,251 --> 00:00:58,811
Just thought I'd point
that out to you.

23
00:00:58,855 --> 00:01:00,518
I see.

24
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:02,152
I thought maybe
you just stopped

25
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:03,220
to catch your breath.

26
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:05,427
Me, out of breath?

27
00:01:05,468 --> 00:01:07,837
I was climbing
mountains in Ireland

28
00:01:07,874 --> 00:01:09,035
before you were born.

29
00:01:09,077 --> 00:01:10,842
You mean "hills," don't you?

30
00:01:10,881 --> 00:01:13,250
They have gently sloping
hills in Ireland.

31
00:01:13,286 --> 00:01:14,413
No mountains.

32
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:17,252
But what do I know?

33
00:01:17,362 --> 00:01:19,856
After all,
you're the mountain man...

34
00:01:19,901 --> 00:01:22,532
an old mountain man.

35
00:01:24,243 --> 00:01:25,735
You know something, Muniz?

36
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,409
You're due for a transfer.

37
00:01:27,451 --> 00:01:30,652
How does waste extraction sound?

38
00:01:34,065 --> 00:01:35,967
How's it going, Chief?

39
00:01:36,002 --> 00:01:37,027
Fine, sir.

40
00:01:37,071 --> 00:01:39,304
We finished the survey
of the south slope.

41
00:01:39,376 --> 00:01:41,779
What do you think, old man?

42
00:01:41,815 --> 00:01:43,478
Is this place worth mining?

43
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:45,990
Absolutely. The cormaline
is only a few hundred meters

44
00:01:46,024 --> 00:01:48,495
below the surface, and
if my readings are correct

45
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,662
it's one of the richest
veins I've ever seen.

46
00:01:51,704 --> 00:01:52,933
Mr. Worf?

47
00:01:52,973 --> 00:01:55,171
Strategically,
the planet's location

48
00:01:55,211 --> 00:01:56,908
would make it difficult
to maintain

49
00:01:56,948 --> 00:01:59,078
adequate supply lines
but not impossible.

50
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,179
Hoya to Captain Sisko.

51
00:02:00,222 --> 00:02:01,748
Go ahead.

52
00:02:01,792 --> 00:02:04,959
Sir, our sensors have detected
a ship dropping out of warp.

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,299
What kind of ship?

54
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:07,564
I'm not sure, sir.

55
00:02:07,605 --> 00:02:09,165
I can't get
a good reading on it.

56
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:10,940
Plasma leaks
from its warp nacelles

57
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,312
are disrupting our sensors.

58
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:13,875
Whatever it is, it's fallen

59
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,323
into the gravitational pull
of the planet.

60
00:02:16,357 --> 00:02:19,489
It should enter the atmosphere
near your position.

61
00:02:23,774 --> 00:02:25,107
Sir, the ship
withstood the impact.

62
00:02:25,144 --> 00:02:26,339
Survivors?

63
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:28,008
I can't determine that.

64
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,578
We're having trouble penetrating
the hull with our sensors.

65
00:02:30,623 --> 00:02:33,094
Beam us directly
to the crash site.

66
00:02:44,753 --> 00:02:46,518
A warship.

67
00:02:46,558 --> 00:02:48,494
A Jem'Hadar warship.

68
00:04:59,687 --> 00:05:01,748
No hull breach.

69
00:05:01,793 --> 00:05:04,766
The only damage I could find
was a crushed guidance thruster

70
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:06,028
if that's what it is.

71
00:05:06,068 --> 00:05:09,007
Captain, I think we have
an access point.

72
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,270
I'll be right there.

73
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:12,042
So, my young friend

74
00:05:12,081 --> 00:05:13,710
what do you think
we're looking at?

75
00:05:13,752 --> 00:05:15,517
An upside-down ship.

76
00:05:16,826 --> 00:05:17,987
An airlock?

77
00:05:18,028 --> 00:05:19,189
A maintenance hatch?

78
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,199
Maybe.

79
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:22,169
But this is a warship.

80
00:05:22,204 --> 00:05:25,609
On a warship, you want
a big access point

81
00:05:25,644 --> 00:05:28,207
on the belly to...
land troops.

82
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,776
There's hope for you yet, Muniz.

83
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,084
Can you open it, Chief?

84
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:32,284
I think so.

85
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:39,334
Mr. Worf, take the point.

86
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,708
T'Lor, you stay put.

87
00:06:26,946 --> 00:06:28,939
Commander, secure the area.

88
00:07:47,055 --> 00:07:49,253
These men didn't die
in the crash.

89
00:07:49,293 --> 00:07:50,990
They've been dead for hours.

90
00:07:51,031 --> 00:07:53,502
What killed them?

91
00:07:53,537 --> 00:07:56,134
Massive osteonecrosis.

92
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:58,841
Every bone in their
body's been shattered.

93
00:07:58,881 --> 00:08:01,444
Sounds like
inertial damper failure.

94
00:08:01,487 --> 00:08:03,720
The ship accelerated...

95
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,732
people were thrown
into the bulkheads.

96
00:08:06,765 --> 00:08:09,863
Nobody was alive when
this ship hit the planet

97
00:08:09,905 --> 00:08:11,465
yet it survived the impact.

98
00:08:11,576 --> 00:08:14,845
Whoever designed this baby
knew what they were doing.

99
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,156
No viewscreen, no chairs...

100
00:08:19,192 --> 00:08:21,094
No EPS conduits.

101
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,795
No microfusion initiators.

102
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,203
No power converters...

103
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,210
at least none that I can find.

104
00:08:27,244 --> 00:08:29,009
I suppose getting
this ship up and running

105
00:08:29,047 --> 00:08:30,516
won't be easy.

106
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:33,421
I can't even determine
if it has a warp drive.

107
00:08:33,457 --> 00:08:36,088
I wonder if this is what all
the Jem'Hadar ships are like.

108
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,429
The bigger question is:

109
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:39,459
What's a Jem'Hadar ship
doing all the way out here?

110
00:08:39,504 --> 00:08:40,733
We're at least three weeks away

111
00:08:40,773 --> 00:08:42,106
from the nearest
Dominion outpost.

112
00:08:42,143 --> 00:08:45,082
Captain, there are
29 other bodies.

113
00:08:45,116 --> 00:08:46,915
No survivors.

114
00:08:46,954 --> 00:08:49,755
Can we use the runabout's
tractor beam

115
00:08:49,793 --> 00:08:51,262
to haul this thing into orbit?

116
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,860
This would be the greatest
intelligence find

117
00:08:53,902 --> 00:08:55,097
in the last ten years.

118
00:08:55,138 --> 00:08:56,664
We're not going to leave
it here to rust.

119
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:57,801
What do you say, Chief?

120
00:08:57,844 --> 00:09:00,407
Well, we're not going
to haul it out with a runabout.

121
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:03,480
Then we need something
with a little more muscle.

122
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,369
We'll let the Major
be the judge of that.

123
00:09:10,405 --> 00:09:11,965
What I'm saying is

124
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,638
if you're going to prosecute me

125
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,549
I demand that you prosecute
my coconspirator.

126
00:09:16,652 --> 00:09:17,779
I'm not a conspirator.

127
00:09:17,822 --> 00:09:19,314
What would you call yourself,
Doctor?

128
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:20,326
An idiot.

129
00:09:20,361 --> 00:09:21,796
I'll buy that.

130
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,231
For asking your help
in the first place.

131
00:09:23,266 --> 00:09:25,430
Would someone please tell
me what's going on here?

132
00:09:25,472 --> 00:09:29,311
Quark brought aboard a shipment
of Regalian fleaspiders

133
00:09:29,346 --> 00:09:30,713
without an import permit.

134
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,117
He asked for them!

135
00:09:32,153 --> 00:09:33,884
The spiders were for you, Major.

136
00:09:33,923 --> 00:09:35,688
I can synthesize a drug
from their venom

137
00:09:35,727 --> 00:09:36,991
which should improve
your circulation.

138
00:09:37,031 --> 00:09:38,124
But I didn't know

139
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,533
I needed a permit
to import them.

140
00:09:39,569 --> 00:09:40,764
So what's the problem?

141
00:09:40,805 --> 00:09:42,138
Fill out the paperwork.

142
00:09:42,175 --> 00:09:43,439
It's not that simple anymore.

143
00:09:43,477 --> 00:09:45,948
It seems that Quark
took the opportunity

144
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:49,286
to import illegal
Regalian liquid crystals

145
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:51,384
along with the fleaspiders.

146
00:09:51,429 --> 00:09:54,162
The crystals are
a highly intoxicating

147
00:09:54,201 --> 00:09:56,729
and sometimes dangerous
aphrodisiac.

148
00:09:56,773 --> 00:10:00,269
What's love without danger?

149
00:10:00,315 --> 00:10:01,408
I don't have time for this.

150
00:10:01,451 --> 00:10:03,011
I just spoke with Captain Sisko.

151
00:10:03,054 --> 00:10:05,617
They found a crashed Jem'Hadar
ship in the Gamma Quadrant.

152
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,095
They need the <i>Defiant</i>
right away.

153
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,463
I'll be back in about a week.

154
00:10:08,499 --> 00:10:09,467
When do we leave?

155
00:10:09,502 --> 00:10:10,629
I'm leaving right away.

156
00:10:10,671 --> 00:10:14,338
I'd say you have
some legal problems to work out.

157
00:10:14,378 --> 00:10:16,645
Gentlemen...

158
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,705
It's embedded
about 90 meters into the rock.

159
00:10:27,741 --> 00:10:30,577
If I can shake it loose
by firing the main thrusters

160
00:10:30,615 --> 00:10:32,448
hauling it out of here
will be a lot easier.

161
00:10:32,485 --> 00:10:33,714
There's a problem?

162
00:10:33,822 --> 00:10:35,382
Well, to fire
the main thrusters

163
00:10:35,425 --> 00:10:37,658
I need to calibrate
the plasma injectors.

164
00:10:37,696 --> 00:10:40,361
So far, I can't get a grip
on the ion regulator.

165
00:10:40,403 --> 00:10:42,966
You want to try a hyper-spanner
above the matrix?

166
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:46,039
It might open it up a bit.

167
00:10:46,081 --> 00:10:49,452
Maybe we won't send you to waste
extraction after all, Muniz.

168
00:10:49,489 --> 00:10:50,753
Captain...

169
00:10:50,825 --> 00:10:54,162
we buried the bodies
on the other side of that ridge.

170
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,361
The DNA readings...

171
00:10:55,403 --> 00:10:56,929
42 Jem'Hadar, one Vorta.

172
00:10:56,972 --> 00:10:57,962
Hoya to Captain Sisko.

173
00:10:58,008 --> 00:10:58,976
Go ahead.

174
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,377
A Jem'Hadar warship

175
00:11:00,414 --> 00:11:01,609
has just dropped out of warp.

176
00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:02,982
Break orbit
and get out of sight.

177
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:04,454
They've locked phasers on us.

178
00:11:04,488 --> 00:11:05,513
Hard to port!

179
00:11:07,262 --> 00:11:08,959
Shields are down!
Engage warp!

180
00:11:29,911 --> 00:11:30,970
Inside!

181
00:11:31,014 --> 00:11:32,916
We don't stand a chance
in the open.

182
00:12:04,676 --> 00:12:06,202
We may not be safe in here.

183
00:12:06,245 --> 00:12:09,514
The Jem'Hadar can transport
through just about anything.

184
00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:27,859
Why do they not come?

185
00:12:27,893 --> 00:12:28,986
Give them time.

186
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:31,056
Watch our backs, Commander.

187
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,731
We're moving
to the Command Center.

188
00:12:35,911 --> 00:12:37,540
Can you walk?

189
00:12:37,581 --> 00:12:39,244
Faster than you can.

190
00:12:53,616 --> 00:12:55,210
Let me take a look at this.

191
00:12:55,253 --> 00:12:56,654
I'm all right, Captain.

192
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,683
I've had worse
transporter burns.

193
00:12:58,727 --> 00:13:00,287
Where's the medkit?

194
00:13:00,331 --> 00:13:01,356
T'Lor had it.

195
00:13:01,401 --> 00:13:03,166
I don't need it, sir.

196
00:13:03,204 --> 00:13:04,297
I'll be all right.

197
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,173
We have to stop the bleeding.

198
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:07,907
I'll take care of that.

199
00:13:12,023 --> 00:13:14,016
Transporter burn.

200
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:15,587
"I'm all right, Captain."

201
00:13:15,632 --> 00:13:17,602
Always kissing up
to the officers

202
00:13:17,636 --> 00:13:18,729
aren't you, Muniz?

203
00:13:18,771 --> 00:13:20,798
Just following your example.

204
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:22,038
You're my hero.

205
00:13:23,282 --> 00:13:24,181
Hey!

206
00:13:24,217 --> 00:13:26,016
I have to get to the wound.

207
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:28,927
But this is my best uniform.

208
00:13:28,961 --> 00:13:31,159
It's the only one
that fits right.

209
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:33,135
Don't worry.

210
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,138
When we get back

211
00:13:34,172 --> 00:13:36,302
we'll have Garak
make you a new one.

212
00:13:38,548 --> 00:13:40,678
How long till the
<i>Defiant</i> gets here?

213
00:13:41,722 --> 00:13:43,214
Two and a half days.

214
00:13:45,497 --> 00:13:47,467
Don't worry, <i>Jefe.</i>

215
00:13:47,502 --> 00:13:49,563
I'll get you through this.

216
00:13:51,677 --> 00:13:54,616
I feel better already.

217
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:57,019
We've only got one
portable generator.

218
00:13:57,055 --> 00:13:58,786
The rest are at base camp.

219
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,494
Looks like you need
a new bandage, Enrique.

220
00:14:06,644 --> 00:14:08,011
Ah. Thanks, Chief.

221
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:11,416
I'll take it from here,
Commander.

222
00:14:15,496 --> 00:14:18,297
Quique, do me a favor.

223
00:14:18,336 --> 00:14:20,967
Please...

224
00:14:21,008 --> 00:14:23,479
stop bleeding before I
run out of clothes.

225
00:14:23,514 --> 00:14:26,042
I'll do the best I can.

226
00:14:27,856 --> 00:14:30,191
What do you make of this,
old man?

227
00:14:32,701 --> 00:14:36,072
My guess, it's some kind
of virtual sensory display.

228
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:38,909
The Jem'Hadar equivalent
of our viewscreen?

229
00:14:38,947 --> 00:14:40,746
There are only two headsets.

230
00:14:40,785 --> 00:14:45,318
One for the Vorta and one
for the Jem'Hadar First.

231
00:14:45,362 --> 00:14:46,523
Guess they're the only ones

232
00:14:46,565 --> 00:14:48,262
who get to see
what's going on outside.

233
00:14:48,302 --> 00:14:51,571
Captain Sisko,
my name is Kilana.

234
00:14:51,609 --> 00:14:54,172
I'm the Vorta in charge
of the Jem'Hadar troops

235
00:14:54,215 --> 00:14:55,308
surrounding you.

236
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,685
If you touch
the triangular green panel

237
00:14:57,722 --> 00:14:59,589
on any of the control consoles

238
00:14:59,626 --> 00:15:01,528
you'll be able to speak to me.

239
00:15:03,034 --> 00:15:04,663
They know your name.

240
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:08,200
They always seem to be
one step ahead of us.

241
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:17,196
This is Captain Sisko.

242
00:15:17,231 --> 00:15:19,725
Captain, I'm so happy
to hear your voice.

243
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:22,834
I heard there were
some casualties among your crew

244
00:15:22,877 --> 00:15:25,542
and I feared
you may have been one of them.

245
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,884
Thank you for your concern.

246
00:15:27,922 --> 00:15:29,391
What do you want?

247
00:15:29,425 --> 00:15:30,826
To talk.

248
00:15:30,862 --> 00:15:32,695
I think it would be
in everyone's best interest

249
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:34,362
if you and I met face-to-face

250
00:15:34,403 --> 00:15:38,401
and discussed the situation,
like reasonable people.

251
00:15:38,445 --> 00:15:40,312
I can be reasonable.

252
00:15:40,349 --> 00:15:41,978
So I've heard.

253
00:15:42,053 --> 00:15:43,716
One escort each.

254
00:15:43,757 --> 00:15:44,850
Agreed?

255
00:15:48,868 --> 00:15:50,998
Agreed.

256
00:15:54,313 --> 00:15:56,876
Your photograph
doesn't do you justice.

257
00:15:56,919 --> 00:16:00,017
You're quite striking in person.

258
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,892
Uh, look, I'm a little busy

259
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:04,060
so let's skip the flattery.

260
00:16:05,504 --> 00:16:07,600
Weyoun's report
on you was right.

261
00:16:07,643 --> 00:16:10,582
You are direct.

262
00:16:10,615 --> 00:16:12,448
I like that.

263
00:16:12,487 --> 00:16:15,186
So, let me cut to the chase.

264
00:16:15,226 --> 00:16:17,823
I believe that is
the correct expression.

265
00:16:17,865 --> 00:16:19,995
This is our ship.
We want it back.

266
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,334
Was your ship.

267
00:16:21,372 --> 00:16:22,567
Now it's mine.

268
00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:23,942
Oh.

269
00:16:23,978 --> 00:16:25,447
Captain, I'm...

270
00:16:25,481 --> 00:16:27,110
I'm a little disappointed.

271
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,985
That's the attitude of a thief

272
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:32,462
not a Starfleet Captain
with a reputation for integrity.

273
00:16:32,497 --> 00:16:34,866
This is clearly our property.

274
00:16:34,902 --> 00:16:37,430
What gives you any claim to it?

275
00:16:37,475 --> 00:16:40,276
An old legal tradition...
salvage rights.

276
00:16:40,314 --> 00:16:43,047
We found a wrecked ship
and a dead crew

277
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:44,681
and we found it first.

278
00:16:44,724 --> 00:16:46,591
A very interesting position.

279
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:50,000
But I'm afraid the Dominion
doesn't recognize that...

280
00:16:50,036 --> 00:16:52,166
tradition.

281
00:16:52,207 --> 00:16:54,337
What may be
even more to the point

282
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:56,406
we have you
completely surrounded

283
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:57,474
and outnumbered.

284
00:16:59,657 --> 00:17:02,026
Would you like
something to eat, Captain?

285
00:17:02,095 --> 00:17:04,122
Or maybe something to drink?

286
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:25,645
These are <i>q'lavas...</i>

287
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,081
a personal favorite.

288
00:17:27,117 --> 00:17:30,613
They're not poisonous,
if that's what you're thinking.

289
00:17:30,658 --> 00:17:32,594
Not to you, anyway.

290
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:39,068
I hope you're not teaching Jake
to be this suspicious, Benjamin.

291
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,704
Or do you prefer Ben?

292
00:17:40,747 --> 00:17:42,239
"Captain" will be fine.

293
00:17:42,283 --> 00:17:45,256
I'm sure it's my fault
that we seem unable

294
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,784
to establish an understanding
between us, Captain.

295
00:17:47,829 --> 00:17:51,793
I'm sorry I'm not more
experienced in these matters.

296
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:54,605
This is my first mission
outside the Dominion

297
00:17:54,644 --> 00:17:59,052
and my very first dealing
with anyone from the Federation.

298
00:17:59,087 --> 00:18:01,456
I know you have
no reason to trust me

299
00:18:01,492 --> 00:18:03,462
but I hope you'll at least try

300
00:18:03,497 --> 00:18:06,025
to consider my offer
with an open mind.

301
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,038
I'm listening.

302
00:18:07,072 --> 00:18:08,371
If you'll leave our ship

303
00:18:08,408 --> 00:18:10,002
I'll take you and your crew

304
00:18:10,044 --> 00:18:12,277
back to your space station...
unharmed.

305
00:18:12,316 --> 00:18:14,446
Our accommodations
may not be lavish

306
00:18:14,488 --> 00:18:16,982
but I promise
you'll all be well cared for

307
00:18:17,027 --> 00:18:18,496
especially your wounded.

308
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,331
If you think I'm going
to deliver my people

309
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:23,396
into your hands without a fight

310
00:18:23,441 --> 00:18:26,380
then this really must be
your first mission.

311
00:18:35,834 --> 00:18:38,431
I'd love to know
how the Captain's doing.

312
00:18:38,474 --> 00:18:41,139
Any chance you can get
this thing working?

313
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,307
Not right away.

314
00:18:42,349 --> 00:18:44,513
I'm still trying to get
the main power grid on line.

315
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,054
What's that?

316
00:19:06,575 --> 00:19:07,543
That wasn't there before.

317
00:19:07,645 --> 00:19:08,704
You sure?

318
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:09,942
Positive.

319
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,824
It's some kind of sensor device.

320
00:19:17,867 --> 00:19:20,532
Whatever it is, it doesn't
look too friendly.

321
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:27,686
Captain.

322
00:19:27,722 --> 00:19:30,125
They're in the ship.

323
00:19:44,626 --> 00:19:45,925
I knew it.

324
00:19:45,962 --> 00:19:48,593
You've been goldbricking
all along.

325
00:19:48,635 --> 00:19:52,075
Like I said,
you taught me everything I know.

326
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,281
Whatever this sensor
was supposed to do

327
00:19:56,318 --> 00:19:58,015
it did it and then shut down.

328
00:19:58,055 --> 00:19:59,888
Probably a surveillance device.

329
00:19:59,926 --> 00:20:02,227
To find out
how many of us there are...

330
00:20:02,264 --> 00:20:03,961
how many weapons we have.

331
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:06,802
I don't think so.

332
00:20:06,841 --> 00:20:08,367
They seem to know all that
already.

333
00:20:08,411 --> 00:20:09,640
But it doesn't make sense.

334
00:20:09,681 --> 00:20:12,118
If he had a rifle,
O'Brien and I would be dead

335
00:20:12,153 --> 00:20:13,645
but all he had was a knife.

336
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,991
And why send only
one Jem'Hadar?

337
00:20:16,028 --> 00:20:17,588
There's something

338
00:20:17,631 --> 00:20:19,864
about this ship,
something so important

339
00:20:19,903 --> 00:20:21,839
that they won't risk
destroying it

340
00:20:21,874 --> 00:20:23,138
in a full-on assault.

341
00:20:23,177 --> 00:20:24,406
If that is true

342
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:26,349
then we must find out
what it is.

343
00:20:26,384 --> 00:20:28,445
Captain, the first thing
we need to do

344
00:20:28,488 --> 00:20:30,549
is make a structural scan
of the ship.

345
00:20:30,593 --> 00:20:31,926
Make our own blueprints.

346
00:20:31,963 --> 00:20:34,491
Get started.

347
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,078
I'm leaking like
a ruptured plasma conduit

348
00:20:41,117 --> 00:20:42,381
aren't I, sir?

349
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:43,911
It's not that bad.

350
00:20:43,956 --> 00:20:45,926
You're lying.

351
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,261
What makes you say that?

352
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:51,135
I called you "sir"
and you didn't even flinch.

353
00:20:53,443 --> 00:20:55,037
I must be dying.

354
00:20:58,387 --> 00:21:00,357
Now you listen to me, Quique.

355
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:03,296
You're not dying
unless I say you're dying

356
00:21:03,332 --> 00:21:05,735
and I say
you're going to make it.

357
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,920
How are you doing, Muniz?

358
00:21:14,957 --> 00:21:15,982
We seem to be having

359
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:18,087
a difference of opinion
on that one, sir.

360
00:21:18,131 --> 00:21:22,129
But I would like
to file a complaint.

361
00:21:22,174 --> 00:21:24,668
The nurses around here
are all thumbs.

362
00:21:27,785 --> 00:21:29,084
You watch it

363
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:32,118
or I'll tighten this bandage
like a tourniquet.

364
00:21:32,162 --> 00:21:34,029
And as for bedside manner

365
00:21:34,066 --> 00:21:35,797
I've known nicer voles.

366
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:37,670
Certainly prettier ones.

367
00:21:37,707 --> 00:21:41,442
You keep moving around,
you won't need any nurse.

368
00:21:41,482 --> 00:21:43,475
Listen to the Chief, Muniz.

369
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,819
Save your strength.

370
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:01,791
I'm worried about him, Captain.

371
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,887
I can't stop the bleeding.

372
00:22:03,932 --> 00:22:06,403
Maybe it's a side effect
of the Jem'Hadar weapons.

373
00:22:06,437 --> 00:22:09,000
They must leave some kind
of anticoagulant.

374
00:22:09,043 --> 00:22:11,241
If I don't get him
to a medical bay soon

375
00:22:11,282 --> 00:22:12,979
he's not going to make it.

376
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:14,214
None of us are going to make it

377
00:22:14,254 --> 00:22:15,746
if we don't
get this ship operational.

378
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,658
I need to get
the power grid functioning

379
00:22:17,695 --> 00:22:19,221
and the aft
turret weapon on line.

380
00:22:19,265 --> 00:22:20,928
You're the only one
who can do that.

381
00:22:20,969 --> 00:22:22,336
I'll take care of Muniz.

382
00:22:22,372 --> 00:22:23,340
Captain...

383
00:22:23,374 --> 00:22:24,809
You have your orders.

384
00:22:25,813 --> 00:22:27,042
Yes, sir.

385
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:43,382
Chief...

386
00:22:43,418 --> 00:22:46,117
structurally,
a lot about this ship's design

387
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:49,061
matches the other
Jem'Hadar warships we've seen.

388
00:22:49,098 --> 00:22:51,331
But there are
significant differences.

389
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,599
There are many systems

390
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:55,007
that we are completely
unfamiliar with.

391
00:22:55,044 --> 00:22:56,536
Well, I can start
to restore power

392
00:22:56,581 --> 00:22:58,141
to the systems one at a time.

393
00:22:58,184 --> 00:23:00,177
That'll give us a chance
to test them

394
00:23:00,222 --> 00:23:01,782
and establish their functions

395
00:23:01,825 --> 00:23:03,454
but it's going to take awhile.

396
00:23:03,496 --> 00:23:04,623
How long?

397
00:23:04,665 --> 00:23:05,826
I wish I knew.

398
00:23:05,868 --> 00:23:07,097
Well, you can do it, Chief.

399
00:23:07,138 --> 00:23:09,234
I don't think
a ship's been invented

400
00:23:09,275 --> 00:23:10,869
that you can't figure out.

401
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:18,521
Muniz is strong.

402
00:23:18,562 --> 00:23:19,861
He'll make it.

403
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:20,889
No.

404
00:23:20,934 --> 00:23:22,061
He will not.

405
00:23:22,104 --> 00:23:24,200
He will not see tomorrow.

406
00:23:24,241 --> 00:23:25,870
You keep that to yourself.

407
00:23:25,912 --> 00:23:28,577
I don't want him to hear
that kind of talk.

408
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:31,088
It does no good to shield him
from the truth.

409
00:23:31,123 --> 00:23:32,558
Let him prepare for death.

410
00:23:32,593 --> 00:23:33,754
The hell I will.

411
00:23:33,796 --> 00:23:36,324
His only hope
is to keep fighting.

412
00:23:36,368 --> 00:23:38,338
If he gives up, it's over.

413
00:23:38,372 --> 00:23:41,436
It was over the moment
he was shot by the Jem'Hadar.

414
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,849
Now, you listen to me.

415
00:23:43,885 --> 00:23:45,582
That boy's life is in our hands

416
00:23:45,622 --> 00:23:47,752
and I won't let anybody
give up on him.

417
00:23:51,635 --> 00:23:53,605
Worf, what do you say
we go look

418
00:23:53,639 --> 00:23:55,940
at that ion exchange matrix
we found?

419
00:23:55,978 --> 00:23:58,142
And on the way,
maybe we can discuss

420
00:23:58,183 --> 00:24:00,586
some of the finer points
of diplomacy.

421
00:24:04,062 --> 00:24:06,158
Captain Sisko.

422
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,433
Captain, you're annoyed with me.

423
00:24:08,472 --> 00:24:09,701
I understand.

424
00:24:09,742 --> 00:24:13,182
You feel betrayed,
and with good reason

425
00:24:13,216 --> 00:24:15,312
but I really think
we should talk.

426
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:17,186
If it will make you feel
any better

427
00:24:17,225 --> 00:24:19,286
I'll come unarmed
and without an escort

428
00:24:19,329 --> 00:24:21,823
but I won't hold you
to the same restrictions.

429
00:24:27,647 --> 00:24:29,845
If you have something
to say, say it.

430
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:34,294
Sending the Jem'Hadar
into the ship was a mistake

431
00:24:34,329 --> 00:24:35,992
and I apologize.

432
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:38,730
I trust no one was hurt

433
00:24:38,771 --> 00:24:40,297
but what choice did I have?

434
00:24:40,342 --> 00:24:43,212
Just like you have to protect
the lives of your men

435
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:44,650
I have to protect our...

436
00:24:44,684 --> 00:24:46,244
property.

437
00:24:46,288 --> 00:24:47,848
But I do hope

438
00:24:47,891 --> 00:24:50,658
we can put that behind us

439
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:51,825
and move on.

440
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:53,803
Move on to what?

441
00:24:57,313 --> 00:24:58,942
I'm sure it's obvious by now

442
00:24:58,983 --> 00:25:01,284
there's something
in the ship we want.

443
00:25:01,321 --> 00:25:04,088
You allow me and my men
to retrieve the item

444
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:06,622
we'll leave.

445
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:08,660
You can keep the ship.

446
00:25:08,704 --> 00:25:09,968
How about this?

447
00:25:10,007 --> 00:25:12,103
You tell me what it is you want

448
00:25:12,145 --> 00:25:14,115
and I'll bring it out to you.

449
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,881
I'm afraid I can't do that.

450
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,981
Don't you trust me?

451
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:21,657
I'd like to, Captain

452
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,329
but I can't.

453
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:26,001
Not under these circumstances.

454
00:25:26,042 --> 00:25:29,015
There's simply...

455
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:31,019
too much at stake for us.

456
00:25:31,053 --> 00:25:33,023
We've got a lot at stake, too.

457
00:25:33,057 --> 00:25:35,858
I won't risk
the lives of my crew.

458
00:25:37,735 --> 00:25:40,434
Well, it seems
we're approaching an impasse.

459
00:25:40,474 --> 00:25:43,572
We've already arrived.

460
00:25:44,616 --> 00:25:46,712
How unfortunate.

461
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:49,751
The negotiations have ended.

462
00:26:25,134 --> 00:26:27,104
I take it things
could have gone better.

463
00:26:28,308 --> 00:26:30,677
All the ship's systems
are shutting down, Captain.

464
00:26:32,417 --> 00:26:34,581
I need to know
what's going on out there.

465
00:26:34,621 --> 00:26:36,819
Chief, get me
some sensor readings.

466
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,024
Dax, take care of Muniz.

467
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:47,178
I can't feel my legs.

468
00:26:47,215 --> 00:26:49,311
Don't worry, they're there.

469
00:26:49,354 --> 00:26:52,327
I managed to bypass
the virtual display interface

470
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:55,459
and hook up a tricorder
to the ship's sensor array.

471
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,099
Those are ultritium concussion
shells they're detonating.

472
00:26:59,142 --> 00:27:01,443
Without shields, a direct
hit would destroy us.

473
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,849
I do not believe
they are trying to hit us.

474
00:27:03,885 --> 00:27:06,584
Their targeting systems
cannot be that ineffective.

475
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,151
They're trying to rattle us.

476
00:27:10,033 --> 00:27:15,170
And we're not going
to let them do that.

477
00:27:15,211 --> 00:27:17,307
The Vorta doesn't want the ship.

478
00:27:17,348 --> 00:27:19,546
She wants something aboard it.

479
00:27:19,587 --> 00:27:21,113
Any idea what?

480
00:27:21,157 --> 00:27:22,558
It could be anything...

481
00:27:22,594 --> 00:27:25,533
encoding device,
guidance system...

482
00:27:25,566 --> 00:27:27,126
Maybe she lost an earring.

483
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:28,331
Whatever it is

484
00:27:28,406 --> 00:27:29,875
it's keeping us alive.

485
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:31,903
Find it!

486
00:27:33,751 --> 00:27:35,721
Chief...

487
00:27:35,756 --> 00:27:37,817
I need that weapon.

488
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,161
I'll still have to charge
the emitter arrays.

489
00:27:40,199 --> 00:27:41,394
Stay on it.

490
00:27:52,893 --> 00:27:54,658
You have your weapon, sir.

491
00:27:54,697 --> 00:27:56,189
Nice work, Mr. O'Brien.

492
00:27:56,234 --> 00:27:57,794
But the bad news is...

493
00:27:57,837 --> 00:27:59,864
the turret is stuck.

494
00:27:59,908 --> 00:28:02,539
You can only fire
in one direction.

495
00:28:02,582 --> 00:28:04,815
Maybe we'll get lucky
and the Jem'Hadar

496
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:06,549
will pick that place to stand.

497
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:17,907
Easy, Quique.

498
00:28:17,948 --> 00:28:20,249
There's nothing to be afraid of.

499
00:28:20,287 --> 00:28:23,749
I'm not afraid, Papa.

500
00:28:23,794 --> 00:28:27,097
It's beautiful.

501
00:28:27,135 --> 00:28:28,434
<i>Precioso.</i>

502
00:28:31,478 --> 00:28:32,947
Better than last year

503
00:28:32,981 --> 00:28:35,111
don't you think?

504
00:28:39,663 --> 00:28:41,964
<i>Los cohetes...</i>

505
00:28:42,001 --> 00:28:43,971
the fireworks of the <i>carnival...</i>

506
00:28:44,005 --> 00:28:45,804
they're terrific, aren't they?

507
00:28:45,843 --> 00:28:47,312
Easy, Quique.

508
00:28:50,954 --> 00:28:52,947
The colors...

509
00:28:54,962 --> 00:28:57,593
like a thousand shooting stars.

510
00:29:01,978 --> 00:29:04,814
That was a good one, huh?

511
00:29:06,488 --> 00:29:10,452
Yeah, that was a good one.

512
00:29:15,174 --> 00:29:17,144
I'll say one thing
for the Jem'Hadar.

513
00:29:17,178 --> 00:29:18,305
They travel light.

514
00:29:18,347 --> 00:29:21,320
No cargo, no storage
compartments.

515
00:29:21,354 --> 00:29:24,759
I did find these data crystals
in one of the computer rooms.

516
00:29:24,795 --> 00:29:27,859
There may be some
encoded information on them

517
00:29:27,902 --> 00:29:31,467
but the crystal structure
has been randomized.

518
00:29:31,543 --> 00:29:33,376
In other words, they're blank.

519
00:29:33,414 --> 00:29:35,008
As far as I can tell.

520
00:29:35,051 --> 00:29:36,178
It would help

521
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,122
if we knew
what we were looking for.

522
00:29:40,563 --> 00:29:42,533
But we don't.

523
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,378
<i>Las estrellas...</i>

524
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:50,509
<i>mira... que bonita.</i>

525
00:29:50,552 --> 00:29:51,953
<i>En la noche, bonita...</i>

526
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,219
Commander.

527
00:29:55,729 --> 00:29:56,856
What is it?

528
00:29:56,899 --> 00:29:59,029
It may have been
the Vorta's computer console.

529
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:01,006
I found it in one
of the upper compartments

530
00:30:01,042 --> 00:30:03,809
but the power grid is off-line
in that part of the ship.

531
00:30:03,848 --> 00:30:06,115
So you ripped it
out of the wall.

532
00:30:06,153 --> 00:30:08,123
Very nice.

533
00:30:08,157 --> 00:30:09,421
So, what do we do with it now?

534
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,428
Use it for a doorstop?

535
00:30:11,531 --> 00:30:14,298
I do not care
what you do with it.

536
00:30:14,338 --> 00:30:16,866
Worf, I was kidding.
It was a good idea.

537
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:19,541
We'll hook it up and see
if we can get it working.

538
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:22,187
You'd think they'd be tired

539
00:30:22,221 --> 00:30:23,520
of playing this game
with us by now.

540
00:30:23,558 --> 00:30:26,029
I have a game I would
like to play with them.

541
00:30:26,063 --> 00:30:27,862
If only I could
leave this prison

542
00:30:27,901 --> 00:30:30,634
and meet them face-to-face
on a field of battle.

543
00:30:31,675 --> 00:30:34,340
Right now, that doesn't
sound like a bad idea.

544
00:30:38,423 --> 00:30:41,521
Chief, could you
take a look at that console?

545
00:30:53,857 --> 00:30:55,953
That is no way
for anyone to die.

546
00:30:56,998 --> 00:30:59,799
I told you,
he is not going to die.

547
00:30:59,837 --> 00:31:02,810
It is only a matter of time.

548
00:31:03,846 --> 00:31:06,181
So we should just kill him,
right?

549
00:31:06,218 --> 00:31:09,919
If you truly are his friend,
you would consider that option.

550
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:12,020
It would be
a more honorable death

551
00:31:12,064 --> 00:31:13,499
than the one he's enduring.

552
00:31:13,534 --> 00:31:15,470
I'm not some
blood-thirsty Klingon

553
00:31:15,505 --> 00:31:17,635
looking for an excuse
to murder my friend.

554
00:31:17,744 --> 00:31:18,734
That's enough.

555
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:21,342
No.

556
00:31:21,385 --> 00:31:23,355
You are just
another weak human

557
00:31:23,389 --> 00:31:24,915
afraid to face death.

558
00:31:27,231 --> 00:31:28,860
I said that's enough!

559
00:31:28,901 --> 00:31:30,370
You're Starfleet officers.

560
00:31:30,405 --> 00:31:32,672
Now, start acting like it!

561
00:31:32,777 --> 00:31:34,337
Tough guys...

562
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,247
a little pressure
and they buckle.

563
00:31:37,586 --> 00:31:42,359
Dax, maybe you haven't noticed,
but no one's laughing.

564
00:31:47,075 --> 00:31:49,045
Now, I know it's hot.

565
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:50,138
We're filthy.

566
00:31:50,181 --> 00:31:51,582
Tired.

567
00:31:51,617 --> 00:31:55,022
And we've got ten isotons
of explosives going off outside.

568
00:31:55,058 --> 00:31:56,823
But we will never
get out of this

569
00:31:56,862 --> 00:31:58,422
if we don't pull it together

570
00:31:58,466 --> 00:32:00,527
and start to act
like professionals.

571
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:06,700
Chief, I want that power grid
up and running.

572
00:32:06,734 --> 00:32:09,171
Aye, sir.

573
00:32:09,207 --> 00:32:12,305
Commander Worf, see if you can
get that turret to rotate.

574
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,283
Aye, sir.

575
00:32:17,024 --> 00:32:18,891
Dax, search the ship again

576
00:32:18,928 --> 00:32:19,953
and again

577
00:32:19,997 --> 00:32:22,298
until you find
what the Vorta wants.

578
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,468
Yes, sir.

579
00:32:30,487 --> 00:32:33,756
And you, Mr. Muniz...

580
00:32:33,794 --> 00:32:37,290
your orders are...

581
00:32:37,335 --> 00:32:39,533
to stay alive.

582
00:32:44,117 --> 00:32:45,916
Captain's Log, supplemental.

583
00:32:45,954 --> 00:32:47,321
The Jem'Hadar barrage

584
00:32:47,357 --> 00:32:49,794
has continued on and off
for ten hours.

585
00:32:49,829 --> 00:32:51,458
Chief O'Brien has restored

586
00:32:51,566 --> 00:32:53,092
main power and helm control.

587
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,472
If we can bring
the ship's engines on line

588
00:32:55,509 --> 00:32:58,482
we may be able to lift off
and escape from here.

589
00:32:58,581 --> 00:33:01,144
As soon as we finish calibrating
the induction reactors

590
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:02,748
we can fire up the main core.

591
00:33:04,896 --> 00:33:07,026
Good, because, unless
there are any objections

592
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,594
I'd like to get
the hell off this planet.

593
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:09,606
I'm for that.

594
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,608
Ready, Chief.

595
00:33:10,642 --> 00:33:12,271
I could use
a couple more hours

596
00:33:12,312 --> 00:33:14,373
to fine-tune
the magnetic flux couplers

597
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:17,583
but under the circumstances,
now's as good a time as any.

598
00:33:17,623 --> 00:33:18,591
Then let's do it.

599
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:20,322
Everyone brace yourselves.

600
00:33:20,364 --> 00:33:22,334
This is going to be
a rough ride.

601
00:33:22,368 --> 00:33:24,167
Commence launch sequence.

602
00:33:24,205 --> 00:33:25,834
Ion thrusters fully charged.

603
00:33:25,875 --> 00:33:27,674
Ventral impellers,
one quarter.

604
00:33:27,712 --> 00:33:29,682
Plasma compensators, on line.

605
00:33:29,717 --> 00:33:31,346
Thrusters to one half.

606
00:33:35,363 --> 00:33:37,424
Chief, I'm getting
a low-frequency resonance

607
00:33:37,467 --> 00:33:38,766
in the main reactor housing.

608
00:33:38,804 --> 00:33:40,033
That's all right.

609
00:33:40,073 --> 00:33:42,306
Just keep compensating
with the inertial dampers.

610
00:33:42,345 --> 00:33:44,144
Dampers are at maximum.

611
00:33:44,182 --> 00:33:45,708
We need more power.

612
00:33:45,752 --> 00:33:47,916
Ventral jets to one half.

613
00:33:49,026 --> 00:33:50,325
It's working, Captain.

614
00:33:50,363 --> 00:33:52,732
These engines
just might shake us loose.

615
00:33:52,767 --> 00:33:54,931
Increase power to one half.

616
00:33:57,044 --> 00:33:59,675
Main reactor housing,
destabilizing.

617
00:33:59,716 --> 00:34:01,242
Reactor containment field
overloading.

618
00:34:01,287 --> 00:34:03,018
Induction dampers
disintegrating, Captain.

619
00:34:03,057 --> 00:34:05,460
If we don't cut power, we're
going to have a core breach.

620
00:34:07,467 --> 00:34:08,868
Disengage thrusters.

621
00:34:08,903 --> 00:34:10,429
Power down all systems.

622
00:34:17,923 --> 00:34:19,222
How bad?

623
00:34:19,259 --> 00:34:21,730
Main power grid
is completely fused.

624
00:34:21,764 --> 00:34:24,600
Structural integrity field
has collapsed.

625
00:34:26,275 --> 00:34:28,838
We'll have to wait
until the <i>Defiant</i> gets here.

626
00:34:28,881 --> 00:34:30,783
She'll be able to pull us
out of here

627
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:31,979
with a tractor beam.

628
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,491
Which means we have 36 hours
to make repairs.

629
00:34:34,526 --> 00:34:36,827
You all know what to do.

630
00:34:40,773 --> 00:34:44,008
I could really
use your help now, Quique.

631
00:35:16,652 --> 00:35:19,648
I told Muniz
he was going to make it.

632
00:35:20,995 --> 00:35:23,296
That's what a Captain's
supposed to say.

633
00:35:26,841 --> 00:35:31,807
I have got to get this ship
back to the station, old man.

634
00:35:31,852 --> 00:35:35,019
Five people have died
on this mission.

635
00:35:37,297 --> 00:35:40,030
I want to be able
to tell their families why.

636
00:35:45,181 --> 00:35:46,707
Ben...

637
00:36:01,984 --> 00:36:03,283
It's a changeling.

638
00:36:19,724 --> 00:36:21,591
It can't hold its shape.

639
00:36:23,432 --> 00:36:25,665
It's dying.

640
00:36:25,771 --> 00:36:27,764
Then we're in trouble.

641
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,215
That's what the Vorta

642
00:36:31,249 --> 00:36:34,484
has been looking for...
a Founder.

643
00:36:34,523 --> 00:36:37,086
No wonder the Jem'Hadar
wouldn't attack.

644
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:40,590
They couldn't risk
killing one of their Gods.

645
00:37:06,627 --> 00:37:08,256
The bombing stopped.

646
00:37:08,297 --> 00:37:09,596
Prepare for an assault.

647
00:37:09,633 --> 00:37:11,262
Tell Worf to man the...

648
00:37:11,303 --> 00:37:12,670
Where are your soldiers?

649
00:37:12,707 --> 00:37:13,868
They're dead.

650
00:37:13,909 --> 00:37:15,344
They killed themselves.

651
00:37:15,379 --> 00:37:16,678
Why?

652
00:37:16,716 --> 00:37:20,589
Because they allowed
a Founder to die.

653
00:37:20,625 --> 00:37:22,721
You should have trusted me.

654
00:37:22,795 --> 00:37:24,059
How could I?!

655
00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:26,366
The first word out of
your mouth was a lie!

656
00:37:26,403 --> 00:37:29,706
This isn't your first mission
outside the Dominion, is it?

657
00:37:31,114 --> 00:37:33,347
I regret saying that

658
00:37:33,386 --> 00:37:36,723
but my offer was genuine.

659
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,393
All that mattered to me
was the Founder.

660
00:37:40,434 --> 00:37:42,461
Then you should have
told me about him.

661
00:37:42,506 --> 00:37:45,479
You might have killed him
or made him a hostage.

662
00:37:45,512 --> 00:37:46,981
No.

663
00:37:48,352 --> 00:37:52,123
All I wanted was the ship.

664
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,156
And I was willing
to let you take it.

665
00:37:59,676 --> 00:38:00,940
So...

666
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,317
this is how it ends.

667
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:09,153
It's true.

668
00:38:09,198 --> 00:38:11,431
The Jem'Hadar died
by their own hands.

669
00:38:13,707 --> 00:38:15,370
Muniz...

670
00:38:17,716 --> 00:38:19,549
the runabout crew...

671
00:38:21,391 --> 00:38:23,361
your soldiers...

672
00:38:23,396 --> 00:38:27,063
they'd all still be alive
if we had trusted each other.

673
00:38:27,103 --> 00:38:32,046
I have no way of stopping you
from taking the ship.

674
00:38:32,081 --> 00:38:34,814
All I ask is that you
allow me to remove

675
00:38:34,921 --> 00:38:37,119
some of the Founder's remains.

676
00:38:40,934 --> 00:38:42,426
Of course.

677
00:39:08,428 --> 00:39:11,127
Do you have any Gods,
Captain Sisko?

678
00:39:11,167 --> 00:39:15,006
There are things I believe in.

679
00:39:15,042 --> 00:39:17,445
Duty?

680
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:19,127
Starfleet? The Federation?

681
00:39:23,135 --> 00:39:25,368
You must be pleased
with yourself.

682
00:39:25,473 --> 00:39:28,469
You have this ship
to take back to them.

683
00:39:30,318 --> 00:39:32,345
I hope it was worth it.

684
00:39:32,388 --> 00:39:35,623
So do I.

685
00:40:05,395 --> 00:40:08,857
What did Starfleet have to say
about our prize?

686
00:40:08,902 --> 00:40:10,235
They're pleased.

687
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:13,903
That's all?
Just pleased?

688
00:40:13,946 --> 00:40:16,042
Very pleased.

689
00:40:16,085 --> 00:40:18,055
They're giving us all medals.

690
00:40:20,361 --> 00:40:22,457
I'll add it to my collection.

691
00:40:22,499 --> 00:40:27,738
Starfleet Command is waiting
for my official report

692
00:40:27,777 --> 00:40:30,613
but every time I try
to get it started...

693
00:40:32,454 --> 00:40:35,187
I find myself staring
at the casualty list

694
00:40:35,227 --> 00:40:39,760
and reading the same five names
over and over again.

695
00:40:39,803 --> 00:40:47,218
T'Lor, Rooney,
Bertram, Hoya, Muniz.

696
00:40:47,253 --> 00:40:51,160
It may sound cruel,
but we both know

697
00:40:51,195 --> 00:40:53,530
that ship out there
was worth it.

698
00:40:53,567 --> 00:40:58,567
Those five deaths
may save 5,000 lives

699
00:40:58,612 --> 00:41:00,708
or maybe even five million.

700
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:04,713
And if I had to make the same
trade all over again, I would.

701
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:10,428
But five people are dead.

702
00:41:10,471 --> 00:41:12,532
Fine men and women who deserved

703
00:41:12,643 --> 00:41:16,083
a lot more than to die
on some lonely planet

704
00:41:16,117 --> 00:41:18,087
50,000 light-years
away from home!

705
00:41:20,593 --> 00:41:24,762
When you were at the Academy,
was Professor Somak teaching?

706
00:41:26,105 --> 00:41:28,906
Moral and Ethical Issues
of Command.

707
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:32,146
I remember her favorite speech:

708
00:41:32,185 --> 00:41:34,588
"Always maintain
emotional distance

709
00:41:34,691 --> 00:41:38,131
between yourself
and those under your command."

710
00:41:38,165 --> 00:41:41,468
It's good advice.

711
00:41:41,506 --> 00:41:42,941
And I try to follow it

712
00:41:42,976 --> 00:41:46,781
but it's a lot more complicated
outside of the classroom.

713
00:41:46,818 --> 00:41:48,811
Did you know

714
00:41:48,855 --> 00:41:53,457
that Jake and Muniz
have the same birthday?

715
00:41:53,499 --> 00:41:57,804
That I performed the ceremony
at Hoya's wedding?

716
00:41:57,842 --> 00:42:01,715
And Rooney...
he could play the trumpet.

717
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:03,811
I heard him at Quark's once

718
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:06,828
and he had the people
dancing in the aisles.

719
00:42:06,862 --> 00:42:08,958
I remember.

720
00:42:10,703 --> 00:42:13,470
And you know something else
I remember about him?

721
00:42:15,647 --> 00:42:20,522
How proud he was
to wear his uniform

722
00:42:20,558 --> 00:42:23,725
and how proud he was
to serve under you.

723
00:42:23,765 --> 00:42:26,362
The same as Hoya

724
00:42:26,404 --> 00:42:31,404
T'Lor, Bertram and Muniz.

725
00:42:33,419 --> 00:42:35,913
They chose a life in Starfleet.

726
00:42:37,595 --> 00:42:39,896
They knew the risks

727
00:42:39,934 --> 00:42:42,167
and they died
fighting for something

728
00:42:42,206 --> 00:42:44,039
that they believed in.

729
00:42:44,076 --> 00:42:46,570
That doesn't make it any easier.

730
00:42:47,617 --> 00:42:50,647
Maybe nothing should.

731
00:43:09,933 --> 00:43:12,906
We used a phase-conjugate
graviton emitter

732
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:14,910
in the tractor beam.

733
00:43:14,944 --> 00:43:18,406
That baby came out
of the rock first time.

734
00:43:18,452 --> 00:43:20,923
You would have loved it, Quique.

735
00:43:22,729 --> 00:43:24,790
I did not mean to interrupt.

736
00:43:24,833 --> 00:43:26,393
It's all right.

737
00:43:26,436 --> 00:43:30,537
You are performing <i>Ak'voh</i>
for your friend.

738
00:43:30,579 --> 00:43:32,515
I am?

739
00:43:32,549 --> 00:43:35,282
Yes. It's
an old Klingon tradition.

740
00:43:35,323 --> 00:43:37,453
When a warrior dies in battle

741
00:43:37,494 --> 00:43:40,956
his comrades stay with the body
to keep away predators.

742
00:43:41,001 --> 00:43:43,837
That allows the spirit
to leave the body

743
00:43:43,875 --> 00:43:45,174
when it is time

744
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:46,770
to make the long
journey to <i>Sto'Vo'Kor.</i>

745
00:43:47,784 --> 00:43:49,777
It's a fine tradition.

746
00:43:57,271 --> 00:43:59,332
What are you doing?

747
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:02,473
We will both keep
the predators away.

748
00:44:05,121 --> 00:44:08,526
I'm sure Quique
would like that.
