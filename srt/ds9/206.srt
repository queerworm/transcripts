1
00:00:01,794 --> 00:00:05,965
BASHIR:
<i>Medical Log, Stardate 47229.1.</i>

2
00:00:05,965 --> 00:00:08,300
<i>Chief O'Brien and I</i>
<i>have been working overtime</i>

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,219
<i>to prepare for the arrival</i>
<i>of a new cartographer.</i>

4
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:14,765
<i>Ensign Melora Pazlar</i>
<i>is the first Elaysian</i>
<i>to join Starfleet,</i>

5
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:18,435
<i>and, as such, requires</i>
<i>special accommodations.</i>

6
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:21,104
I haven't seen one
of these in 300 years.

7
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,815
I'm surprised
it was even on file

8
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:24,566
in the replicator's
data bank.

9
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:25,901
It isn't.

10
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,278
Ensign Pazlar sent me
the specifications.

11
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,905
She really uses one like this?

12
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:32,282
Her normal anti-grav unit
isn't going to work here.

13
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:35,452
Same problem we had with
the Starfleet cargo lifts.

14
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,788
Cardassian construction
just isn't compatible.

15
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:39,790
KIRA:
<i>Ops to Bashir.</i>

16
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,334
<i>The</i> Yellowstone<i> has just</i>
<i>docked at Airlock 14, Doctor.</i>

17
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:44,294
We're on our way.

18
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:50,801
BASHIR:
Just think of what she's gone
through to get here, Jadzia.

19
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,553
What it must be like
to adjust to our gravity

20
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,805
after growing up on a planet
with such low surface gravity.

21
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:57,057
Doctor, we've done
the best we can
with the ramps.

22
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,184
The Cardassians obviously
didn't have her in mind

23
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,020
when they built
this place.

24
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,772
Well, I've managed to modify
the maximum vertical clearance

25
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:06,233
of the chair three centimeters,
to a slope of 56 degrees.

26
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,568
Well, that still leaves
a lot of places

27
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:08,903
around here
she won't have access to.

28
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:10,237
Can't we just use
the transporter

29
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,238
to help her get around?

30
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,865
It makes sense to me,

31
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:15,409
but she sent word that it
wasn't acceptable to her.

32
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,702
I wonder why.

33
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:18,913
BASHIR:
I know exactly why.

34
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:20,288
She went through Academy
the same way.

35
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,540
Once her basic needs are met

36
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,124
she refuses
any special assistance.

37
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,877
She's extraordinary.

38
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:27,546
You make it sound as though
you've known her for years.

39
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:29,339
I almost feel as though I have.

40
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,341
I've pulled all
her personnel

41
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,134
and medical files
to get ready.

42
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:35,094
Her quarters-- they're ready,
aren't they?

43
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:37,389
I've got the bumps on the head
to prove it.

44
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:38,933
Thanks, Chief.

45
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:40,935
Let me know if there's
anything else I can do.

46
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:44,605
That'll be something to see--
when we switch off the gravity

47
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,273
and she flies around the room.

48
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:49,735
(<i> panting</i> )

49
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:12,299
Ensign Melora Pazlar
reporting for duty.

50
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:13,550
Welcome to DS9, Ensign.

51
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,886
I'm Chief Science Officer
Jadzia Dax

52
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,012
and this is...

53
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:18,597
Dr. Bashir, we spoke
on subspace.

54
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:20,015
Good to meet you in person.

55
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:21,182
I see you have
my trolley car
ready to go.

56
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,225
As requested.

57
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,143
Can I help?

58
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,895
I'm fine, thank you.

59
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,407
That's better.

60
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,159
You've modified it.

61
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,744
Yes, I wanted
to give you

62
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,454
as much mobility
as I could.

63
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:43,831
I've been practicing

64
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:46,125
on the model
I requested for a month.

65
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,375
Well, it's no problem.

66
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,628
We can replicate
the other design.

67
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:51,880
No, I'll just have to adapt.

68
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,430
DAX:
I will be accompanying you
on your survey mission.

69
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,349
I really don't think that'll be
necessary, Lieutenant.

70
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:05,144
I'm perfectly capable
of piloting a runabout.

71
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:06,895
Commander Sisko
thought that it...

72
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,647
I'm sure he thought
what every officer

73
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:10,273
I've ever served with
has thought--

74
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,526
that I need extra help
to get the job done.

75
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:13,944
Please tell him I don't.

76
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:16,363
Commander Sisko
wouldn't allow any Ensign

77
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,656
to take a runabout
into the Gamma Quadrant

78
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:18,949
the day after
she arrives.

79
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:20,534
I'm sure
the Chief Science Officer

80
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:21,952
has more
important things to do

81
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,412
than chart a sector
in the Gamma Quadrant.

82
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,957
Um, here we are.

83
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,583
You didn't modify
the specifications

84
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:29,710
I gave you
for my quarters, did you?

85
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,170
Not one iota.

86
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,672
You can control the gravity unit
with this device.

87
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:34,715
If you'd care to try it out...

88
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:35,924
Thank you, I will.

89
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,760
It was a pleasure
meeting both of you.

90
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:47,889
MAN:
Paltriss only created
80 of them, each a...

91
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,390
a work of art.

92
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,768
And I've come into
the possession of 42.

93
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:55,981
Forty-two?

94
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:58,817
My world will
honor your name

95
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:00,735
for returning
the rings of Paltriss

96
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:01,820
to his birthplace.

97
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,155
Honor my name
all you like

98
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:04,865
as long as your honor
is accompanied

99
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,659
by 199 bars of
gold-pressed latinum.

100
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,581
I heard you drive
a hard bargain.

101
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,584
Shall we celebrate
our closing the deal

102
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,170
with another drink?

103
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,215
(<i> sighs</i> )

104
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,845
Excuse me.

105
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:28,889
I'm sorry.

106
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,307
We're not open yet

107
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:32,017
but if you'll
come back in...

108
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,772
Have another
drink on me.

109
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:45,155
Fallit Kot, is
it really you?

110
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:48,075
How long has it been?

111
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:51,703
Eight years.
Eight long years.

112
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,997
Oh, it can't be.

113
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:58,752
I must say,
you look terrific.

114
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,045
Tanned, toned up...

115
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,005
all that baby fat
has disappeared

116
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,590
from your face.

117
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,051
You don't keep extra weight on
where I've been.

118
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,802
(<i> laughs uncomfortably</i> )

119
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,887
Just passing through
are you?

120
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,597
I bet you
have business

121
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:11,973
in the Gamma Quadrant.

122
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,517
You always had a sharp eye
for fresh territory.

123
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,061
Oh, I'm not going
to the Gamma Quadrant.

124
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,521
My business is
right here with you.

125
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,522
With me?

126
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,648
That's right.

127
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,695
I've come to kill you, Quark.

128
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,496
DAX:
I've gone through
her mission profile

129
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,457
and she certainly seems
to know what she's doing.

130
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,833
Nevertheless, this is

131
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,294
her first deep
space assignment.

132
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:42,045
And it doesn't make
sense to me to...

133
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,505
(<i> electronic whirring</i> )

134
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,549
Here she is.

135
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,432
Welcome, Ensign.

136
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:56,393
I'm Commander Benjamin Sisko.

137
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,019
Am I late?

138
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,854
No, not at all.

139
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,482
It looked as though the meeting
had already begun.

140
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,067
Dax and Bashir
were just telling me

141
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,819
about your request
to pilot a runabout alone.

142
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,992
Wouldn't it have
been more appropriate

143
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,202
to include me
in that conversation?

144
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,287
I was getting a briefing

145
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,164
by my senior
officers, Ensign.

146
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:20,167
We discuss personnel
matters all the time.

147
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:23,128
I'm sorry if I seem
overly sensitive,

148
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,546
but I'm used
to being shut out

149
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,299
of the "Melora problem."

150
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:30,760
The truth is, there is
no "Melora problem"

151
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,096
until people create one.

152
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,140
(<i> panting</i> )

153
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,313
This may sound
ungrateful

154
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:43,648
because Dr. Bashir has
been wonderfully helpful

155
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,859
in the preparations
for my arrival,

156
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,987
but frankly, I wonder
why a medical opinion

157
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,072
is necessary
in this discussion.

158
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,949
Julian knows more
of your capabilities

159
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,701
than any of us.

160
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,537
I don't need a medical opinion
to tell me my own capabilities.

161
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,080
Ensign...
I simply object

162
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,375
to being treated
like someone who is ill.

163
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,377
I don't see anybody doing that.

164
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,795
Try sitting in the
chair, Commander.

165
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:09,341
No one can understand
until they sit in the chair.

166
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,391
I've been in one chair
or another

167
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,267
since I left my home world.

168
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,562
My family gave me this cane.

169
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:27,025
It's made from the wood
of a garlanic tree.

170
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,318
They had no idea
what it would be like

171
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:29,528
to live off-world

172
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:32,197
in what you consider
"normal" gravity.

173
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:35,116
Only a handful of Elaysians
have ever left home,

174
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,785
but I always knew
that I had to be one of them.

175
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:41,915
I dreamt about exploring
the stars as a child,

176
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:46,336
and I wasn't going to allow
any... handicap--

177
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:50,549
not a chair,
not a Cardassian station--

178
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:53,260
to stop me
from chasing that dream.

179
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,053
You must feel
a great deal of pride

180
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:57,013
about everything
you've achieved.

181
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,140
And I've achieved that,
Commander,

182
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,684
without being dependent
on anybody.

183
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:06,064
To be honest,
I prefer to work alone.

184
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,941
It's simply easier for me.

185
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,317
(<i> sighs</i> )

186
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,569
I am not comfortable

187
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:12,487
sending you alone
into the Gamma Quadrant.

188
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:16,491
Sir... I can focus
on the job better.

189
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:19,453
I-I can work at my own pace
without being a bother

190
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,246
to anyone else.

191
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:24,124
Lieutenant Dax will
be going with you.

192
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,129
Yes, sir.

193
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:33,007
When do you wish to leave,
Lieutenant?

194
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:36,511
Your schedule
is fine with me.

195
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:39,013
Then tomorrow at 0730.

199
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:57,616
Is it working?

200
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:59,742
The low-grav
field actuator.

201
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,744
I just heard it go off.

202
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,746
It's working fine.

203
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,415
So you were just...

204
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,208
Oh, um... for me

205
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,711
it's like slipping
into a hot tub

206
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:13,423
at the end
of a long day.

207
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:15,091
Really?

208
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,179
I'm a shower man, myself.

209
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:21,764
Look at this.

210
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,227
Is this your husband?

211
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,562
Boyfriend?

212
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:32,317
Doctor, if you came
for an apology...

213
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,818
I apologize.

214
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,487
Apology?

215
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:38,823
My speech wasn't intended
to attack you personally.

216
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:44,371
I'm sure you never set out
to attack anyone personally,

217
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,540
but you do seem to attack a lot.

218
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,042
That's rather insensitive
of you, Doctor.

219
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,293
Julian.

220
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,295
I'm no longer your doctor.

221
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,712
I see.

222
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,798
You've decided I need a friend.

223
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,051
Ooh, was that an attack?

224
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,887
You see, you do it
so well, with such charm

225
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,597
it's hard to tell.

226
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:06,476
I really don't mean to...

227
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,478
Sure you do.

228
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:09,646
I beg your pardon?

229
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,523
Of course you mean to.

230
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:14,108
All of these broad shots
you fire--

231
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,734
they're just your way

232
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,487
of keeping the rest of the
universe on the defensive.

233
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:18,863
Has to be.

234
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,657
You're too good at it.

235
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,367
Well, uh...

236
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,579
it always seemed to work
pretty well.

237
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:29,040
Until now.

238
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,168
Well,<i> that</i> is the nicest thing
you've said to me.

239
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:35,463
Or anybody else.

240
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:37,798
Are you hungry?

241
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:40,510
I came here

242
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,761
thinking about
asking you to dinner.

243
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:44,805
Then afterwards,
we'll go dancing

244
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:45,806
I suppose.

245
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,100
Ooh, Red Alert.

246
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:51,938
I'm sorry.

247
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:54,982
Well, come on.

248
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,610
There's a new Klingon
restaurant open on the Promenade

249
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,946
if... you like
that sort of thing.

250
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,865
All right.

251
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,997
(<i> laughter and conversation</i> )

00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,472
Dinner is served.

253
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,223
I didn't
order dinner.

254
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,016

Do you know dabo,
Fallit?

267
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,272
It's a wonderfully
entertaining game

268
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,524
and easy to learn.

(<i> snaps fingers</i> )

270
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,068

When I was ten,

315
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:20,187
my father was
a Federation diplomat

316
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,440
on Invernia II.

317
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,733
One day, when we were

318
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,777
out on a remote
part of the planet,

319
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:28,404
we were hit by a
massive ionic storm,

320
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,031
and while we were
waiting it out

321
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:35,035
we found an Invernian girl,
about my age, who was sick.

322
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:38,331
After the storm cleared,
my father went for help,

323
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,207
but it was too late.

324
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,669
I sat there and watched her die.

325
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,004
The next day when he returned,

326
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,174
his guide told us that we
could have treated her

327
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,634
with a simple herb

328
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,803
that was growing
all around.

329
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,348
I could have saved her life.

330
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:00,603
And so you started
to study medicine.

331
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:04,941
Actually, first
I started to study tennis.

332
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,400
Tennis?

333
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,569
I really thought I could
make a career out of it.

334
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,029
You must be very good.

335
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,823
Well, I used to think so

336
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:15,409
but then I went to my
first major competition.

337
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,203
My opponent served first

338
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,580
and I heard the ball
bounce past me.

339
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,499
The computer announced
it was good

340
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,292
and I realized
I was in trouble.

341
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:27,005
Turned out, I had more talent
at medicine than tennis.

astrometric array

360
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,961
after going through
the mission profile again.

361
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:50,004
I came to the storage
bay to get one.

362
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:52,548
My mind was already
in the Gamma Quadrant.

363
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,508
I wasn't... paying
enough attention

364
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:55,593
to what I was doing.

365
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,720
I guess my boot

366
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,764
didn't make the lip
of the door.

367
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,933
I fell on my controls.

368
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:03,225
Dax to Bashir.

369
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:06,062
Ensign Pazlar's had
a, uh, minor accident.

370
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:07,271
We need to see you
in the Infirmary.

371
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,522
BASHIR:
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

372
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:09,523
<i>I'll be there in three minutes.</i>

373
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,984
What kind
of an architect

374
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,193
would deliberately
design a raised rim

375
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,446
at the entrance
to every door?

376
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,702
So much for the dangers
of the Gamma Quadrant.

377
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,704
I didn't even
make it there.

378
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,247
You will.

379
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,749
There's no concussion.

380
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:28,626
You can reschedule your
mission for tomorrow.

381
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,462
It was so...

382
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:34,007
(<i> sighs</i> )

383
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:37,802
Flopping back and forth
like a broken toy.

384
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:40,262
I didn't want anyone
to find me like that

385
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,306
but I couldn't
get up by myself.

386
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,891
Why didn't you
wait for Dax

387
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,601
before you went
into an area

388
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,769
that was unmodified with ramps?

389
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,312
I didn't need Dax

390
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,397
if I'd just paid attention.

391
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,775
Melora...

392
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,568
no one on
this station

393
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,988
is completely
independent.

394
00:19:56,988 --> 00:20:00,574
In space, we all depend
on one another to some degree.

395
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:04,037
I just want you all to know
that you can depend on me.

396
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,455
You've proven that.

397
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,625
Now what do the rest of us
have to do to convince you?

398
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,127
Of what?

399
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,587
That you can depend on us.

400
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,010
Have you ever heard
of the work

401
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,302
Nathaniel Teros did

402
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,638
with low-gravity
species 30 years ago?

403
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,306
Neuromuscular adaptation.

404
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,975
It had no practical
success at all.

405
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:28,061
No, but the principles
were sound

406
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:29,603
and a lot of progress
has been made

407
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,522
in neurochemistry
since then.

408
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:32,690
You think someday

409
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,483
I could throw away
the chair?

410
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,988
Theoretically...
perhaps.

411
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,120
Would you like
to come in?

412
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,206
Oh, no, I know how much
you look forward

413
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:49,999
to turning down
the gravity.

414
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:55,796
Don't let that stop you.

415
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:04,931
You may want
to brace yourself

416
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:06,599
until you get
used to it.

417
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:28,704
Come on, Julian.

418
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,170
What do I do?

419
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,089
Just give
a gentle push.

420
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:39,548
It's easy.

421
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:42,969
(<i> hesitant gasps</i> )

422
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:45,387
Oh... oh... oh...

423
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:49,100
Oh, oh... Oh!

424
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,852
This is astonishing!

425
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,647
I can't tell you how curious
I was about this.

426
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,108
Oh.

427
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:58,859
Most people are.

428
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:02,113
Sometimes they make me feel
like a carnival attraction.

429
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:04,698
So usually I prefer
to keep everyone out.

430
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:07,743
Well, thank you...
for letting me in.

431
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,830
(<i> clears throat</i> )

432
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,498
He's my brother.

433
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,374
Who?

434
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:20,798
Oh.

435
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:05,551
Setting course 28 mark 142.

436
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:06,802
Confirmed.

437
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:15,811
Computer... any
Vulcan études on file?

438
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,813
COMPUTER:
<i>Affirmative.</i>

439
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,982
If you have
no objections.

440
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:23,819
Computer, play us
something by Delvok.

441
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,988
Delvok never seems Vulcan to me.

442
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:27,489
There's too much... emotion

443
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,159
in his music.

444
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,370
(<i> quiet plucked-string melody</i>
<i>playing</i> )

445
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,372
It's pretty.

446
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:41,379
Tell me something,
Lieutenant--

447
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:43,505
you think there's room

448
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,175
for... romance
in Starfleet?

449
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,802
I think so.

450
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,012
You've made it work?

451
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:52,098
Mmm, now and then.

452
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:54,183
I mean really work.

453
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:56,394
Oh... really work.

454
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:57,811
Yes.

455
00:23:57,811 --> 00:24:01,565
Well, for that, I'd
have to go back, um...

456
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:02,816
150 years.

457
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,318
Oh...

458
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:06,112
that's a long time.

459
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:10,490
Could it be that Dr. Bashir's
bedside manner has won you over?

460
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:17,290
Our species are just
so... different.

461
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,582
Since when has that

462
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:19,792
ever stopped anyone?

463
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,627
I knew
a hydrogen-breathing Lothra

464
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:24,338
who fell hopelessly in love
with an Oxygene.

465
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:25,756
You're kidding.

466
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:28,092
How could they even be
in the same room?

467
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:30,761
40 minutes a day without
their breathing apparatus.

468
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:31,887
That's all.

469
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,640
57 years they
were together.

470
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,269
What-What about...
career conflicts?

471
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:40,687
Two friends of mine
from the Academy got engaged

472
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:42,648
even though they knew
they were being assigned

473
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:43,607
to different starships.

474
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,858
Subspace relationships?

475
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:45,818
Mm-hmm.

476
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,569
Oh, that's a tough one.

477
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,696
They may not be together
for a year or more,

478
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,657
and even then
for only a few weeks.

479
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:55,828
Love across light-years--
it's just so...

480
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:57,495
It lacks intimacy.

481
00:24:57,495 --> 00:24:59,539
You could say that.

482
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:05,712
I finish my mission here,
I move on to the next one.

483
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:09,175
What kind of future is that
for a romance?

484
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:11,969
Look at the alternative.

485
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:14,888
I guess.

486
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,438
Oh, it's you.

487
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:24,690
Don't be so happy
to see me.

488
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,317
All right, I won't.

489
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:29,862
Odo, there's
a desperate criminal

490
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,197
on board the station.

491
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:33,699
You wouldn't be talking
about Fallit Kot,

492
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:36,369
who just finished eight years
at a labor camp

493
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:38,829
for hijacking a shipment
of Romulan ale,

494
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:41,499
and whose name appears
right next to yours

495
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:42,958
on the original
indictment?

496
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,419
I had nothing to do
with the hijacking itself.

497
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:48,714
I was only the,
uh... middleman.

498
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:49,840
Trafficking
in stolen goods

499
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,175
should have been enough

500
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:53,219
to get you your own cell
at that Romulan camp.

501
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:54,303
Unless, of course,

502
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:57,223
you sold out your partner.

503
00:25:57,223 --> 00:26:00,726
I can honestly say
justice was served.

504
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,811
I would imagine Fallit Kot

505
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,856
is looking for his own
kind of justice now.

506
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:09,651
He threatened to kill me.

507
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:14,990
What?

508
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,616
Nothing.

509
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:17,868
Just a passing thought.

510
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,828
Odo, he means it.

511
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:23,541
Nothing I do
seems to change his mind.

512
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:25,251
You've got to do
something.

513
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:27,794
I'll do my job, Quark.

514
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,587
Yeah.

515
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,301
Unfortunately.

516
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,802
(<i> sighs</i> )

517
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,235
(<i> door opens</i> )

518
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:52,403
<i>Racht,</i> anyone?

519
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:53,653
I've been waiting
for you.

520
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:55,114
I've got something
to show you.

521
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:58,534
What is it?

522
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:00,953
It's a computer model of
an elevated neural output

523
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,538
from the brain's
gross motor cortex.

524
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,123
It's stimulating

525
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:06,708
acetylcholine absorption
to increase tensile strength.

526
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,502
The neuromuscular
adaptation theory?

527
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:10,087
It<i> was</i> theory
30 years ago,

528
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:12,298
but with the development
of neo-analeptic transmitters

529
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:13,673
it's not even that complicated.

530
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:15,509
It's just
that no one's ever gone back

531
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:17,177
to reexamine the ideas
of Nathaniel Teros.

532
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,054
Until now.

533
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:22,099
This...

534
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:24,184
could actually work?

535
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,019
No more servo controls.

536
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,521
No more chair.

537
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:01,263
Have I done
something wrong?

538
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:03,516
Not that I'm aware of.

539
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:07,769
We have something
in common.

540
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,188
We do?

541
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,482
I don't like
Quark either...

542
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:14,776
but I can't
let you kill him.

543
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,320
Kill him?

544
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,239
Did he tell you
I was going to do that?

545
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,908
I know of your
history together.

546
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:24,578
Let bygones be bygones,
I always say.

547
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:29,707
And I always say you can
tell a man's intentions

548
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:31,168
by the way he walks.

549
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:34,796
How do I walk?

550
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:38,634
Like someone carrying a lot
of weight on his shoulders.

551
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:40,844
Must be the memory
of those Romulan bricks

552
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,596
I carried for eight years.

553
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:44,431
Must be.

554
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,975
But you can't lock a man up
for the way he walks,

555
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,811
can you?

556
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,588
Well?

557
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:18,340
I'd say he's a man
with nothing to lose.

558
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,717
As opposed to me.

559
00:29:19,717 --> 00:29:22,261
I have no reason
to hold him for now

560
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:23,512
and he knows it.

561
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:25,472
I'll watch him
the best I can,

562
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:28,141
but I suggest you carry
a combadge with you

563
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,309
at all times.

564
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,936
Call me at the first
sign of trouble.

565
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,980
What if the first sign
is the last sign?

566
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,483
You people sell
pieces of yourself

567
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,026
after you die,
don't you?

568
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,319
Yes.

569
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,820
I'll buy one.

570
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:47,994
My heart is pounding.

571
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:49,705
I'd like to think that
has more to do with me

572
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:50,748
than the neo-analeptic
infusion.

573
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:51,873
Would that also explain

574
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,500
why my backside
is getting warm?

575
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,168
Well, that's more likely
the result

576
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,170
the neuromuscular
tissue stimulation

577
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,381
due to the increased activity
in the motor cortex.

578
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:01,800
I'd say that's enough
first time out.

579
00:30:04,762 --> 00:30:06,388
It's good that you've already

580
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:07,931
been using your muscles
in this gravity environment.

581
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,516
It'll make it
easier to adapt.

582
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,101
Feel any different?

583
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:13,270
No.

584
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,897
Nothing at all?

585
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:18,108
I'm sorry, Julian.

586
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:23,656
The acetylcholine absorption

587
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:25,658
is precisely
at 14% above normal.

588
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:27,493
Increased
tensile strength

589
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:29,495
would be the
inevitable result.

590
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:30,829
Julian?

591
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:37,877
I can lift my leg.

592
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:41,006
Your neural pathways
are beginning to adapt.

593
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,966
Endurance
and coordination

594
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,510
might take a while,

595
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,720
but we should
have you walking

596
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,222
within the hour.

597
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:57,356
How's the upgrade coming?

598
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:58,816

We've been
able to get it

599
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,066
to about 70%
of what we'd get

600
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:01,318
with a standard EPS,

601
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:02,902
but it looks like
that's going to be...

(<i> turbolift whirring</i> )

603
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:05,823
Well, I'll be damned.

604
00:31:07,825 --> 00:31:09,368
I wanted to give you

605
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,787
our first day's mission summary
myself, Commander.

606
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:13,539
A pleasure, Ensign.

607
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,000
Julian, how did you, uh...?

608
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,627
Oh, it was simply a matter
of increasing the output

609
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:20,253
on the brain's
motor cortex.

610
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,797
Someone else's research,
actually.

611
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:23,215
I just dotted the I's
and crossed the T's.

612
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:24,508
Well, you'll get your name

613
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:25,884
in the medical journals
for this one.

614
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,678
Yeah, I know, I...
Julian...

615
00:31:27,678 --> 00:31:29,596
I don't know
how to tell you this

616
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:30,972
but I'm not sure
I can make it...

617
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,766
Easy does it now.

618
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:34,893
It's just the first day's
treatment beginning to wear off.

619
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:35,894
Thank you.

620
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,312
Nothing to be concerned about.

621
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,814
Look, I better get you
back to your quarters.

622
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:40,482
I want you to get a good
night's rest tonight.

623
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:41,483
Oh, thank you.

624

Habitat Ring, Level 14.

625
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,159
With each
progressive treatment

626
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,703
you should get stronger,

627
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:56,081
and the effects
should last longer.

628
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:58,041
(<i> panting</i> )

629
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,710
What about this?

630
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,336
A low-grav
environment now

631
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:04,047
would really confuse
your motor cortex.

632
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,426
I understand.

633
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:12,639
Julian...

634
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:17,853
You let me fly
for the first time.

635
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:22,065
I let you walk.

636
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,442
We're even.

637
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:29,322
I'll see you in the morning.

No one can

Oh, I wasn't prepared
to entertain this evening,

but make yourself at home.

647
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:14,701
Oh, I already have.

What's mine is yours.

649
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:17,704
All you have
to do is ask.

650
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,247
I'm tired of
your gifts, Quark.

651
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:22,876
All I want is your

652

Wait!
Everything's negotiable.

I'm worth much more

The mattress felt like rocks,

662
00:33:57,577 --> 00:34:00,831
and every one of my muscles
ached all night long.

663
00:34:00,831 --> 00:34:02,040
You'll adjust to that

664
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,001
after a few more
treatments.

665
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:06,127
This time the
effects should last

some strange form

If you want to end
your dependence

on the chair
and the servo controls,

678
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:45,124
you're going
to have to give up

679
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,459
the low-grav environment.

680
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,420
You knew that that
was the trade-off.

681
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,630
And it seemed
like a good trade.

If I could just spend...

684
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:57,804
I'm just concerned that
going back and forth

685
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,347
could ultimately lead

686
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,391

could be affected.

690

The effects are
fully reversible

We can pull the plug
at any time before then.

693
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:18,784
But after that,
if all goes well,

694
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:21,954
your motor cortex impulses
will kick in on their own.

But then I start
to think about home

and how I won't ever
be able to go back.

00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:22,157
They warned me
about you!

721
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:23,658
Not true!

722
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,661
A deal is a deal-- Rule
of Acquisition Number 16.

723
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,121
Kot...

724
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:29,581
you got what
you came for.

725
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:30,999
Now let's be
reasonable.

726
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:32,250
(<i> yells</i> )

727
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:36,838
Pick it up.
Pick it up!

728
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:37,923
Move!
Hurry up!

729
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:40,425
Move! Move!

730
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:41,634
Let's go.

731
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,180
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

732
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:48,391
Priority-1 Security
to Level 22, Section 5.

733
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,902
I'm sure Julian
would understand.

734
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:00,904
Besides, he can still
publish the results

735
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:02,197
from your
first treatments.

736
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:04,908
Both of you--
back in the ship.

737
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:06,201
Let's go!

738
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:09,662
Move it!

739
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:13,917
KOT:
Come on, move it!

740
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:16,253
Now, get us
out of here.

741
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:18,296
He's already shot a man.
Do as he says.

742
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,756
I'll just wait
in the back.

743
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:21,216
In the front,
where I can see you.

744
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:22,259
There-- hurry up.

745
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:23,384
I'm moving
as fast as I can!

746
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:24,761
She's an Elaysian.

747
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:27,472
She needs motor support
in our gravity.

748
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:30,725
They're in the<i> Orinoco.</i>

749
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,518
Docking clamps
have been released

750
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:33,937
thrusters engaged.

751
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:36,189
Ready a tractor beam,
open a channel.

752
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:37,482
Open.

753
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,234
This is Commander
Benjamin Sisko.

754
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:41,653
Return to the station at once.

755
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,280
No reply.

756
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,490
Engage the tractor beam.

757
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,495
They've locked onto us
with the tractor beam.

758
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,705
Open the channel
to that Commander of yours.

759
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:56,334
Release this ship
or I'll kill a hostage.

760
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,128
SISKO:
<i>I'm willing to negotiate</i>
<i>your freedom,</i>

761
00:38:58,128 --> 00:38:59,879
<i>but first release those...</i>

762
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:02,048
Didn't you hear
what I just said?

763
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,424
(<i> whimpering</i> )

764
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:06,052
No, I have
something special

765
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,804
<i>in mind for you.</i>

766
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:20,025
Do I make myself clear?

767
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:23,320
Release the ship<i> now.</i>

768
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,280
SISKO:
Doctor, Chief-- with me.

769
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,823
Beam us to the<i> Rio Grande.</i>

770
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:28,116
Give us ten seconds

771
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,617
and then disengage
the tractor beam.

772
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:30,869
Understood.

773
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:34,455
Energizing.

774
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:42,588
They've released us.

775
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:45,008
Through the wormhole.

776
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,240
What was that?

777
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,368
I'm not sure.
What was it?

778
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:13,411
Another ship coming
through the wormhole.

779
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,620
Take us to warp.

780
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,373
We haven't even
set a course yet.

781
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:18,250
I don't care about the course,
just go to warp.

782
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,792
If we don't
set a course,

783
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:22,921
we could warp ourselves
into oblivion.

784
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:24,547
Fine, set a course.

785
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:26,591
Just get us out of here.

786
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,968
They're powering up
their warp drive.

787
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:29,969
Stay with them.

788
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,888
Engaging warp engines.

789
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:34,266
Can we beam them
aboard at warp?

790
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:36,393
I wouldn't recommend that.

791
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:51,366
KOT:
Get the phasers ready.

792
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:53,659
I'm not going
to fire at them.

793
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:56,246
Oh, you'll do it
or you'll die.

794
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:57,872
It's your choice.

795
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:00,417
Fine.

796
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:02,419
Then I hope
you can fly this ship.

797
00:41:02,419 --> 00:41:03,628
Just sit down

798
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:06,505
and do what
I told you. Now.

799
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:11,719
Quark, how well
do you know this man?

800
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,972
We've been friends for years,
not counting today.

801
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,307
DAX:
Well I suggest you
explain to him

802
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:17,225
that Starfleet
isn't going to give up

803
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:18,559
and stop chasing us.

804
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:19,894
That's true, Fallit.

805
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,646
You don't know
these Starfleet types.

806
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:23,356
Then we'll all die.

807
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:27,026
Great, we escape
and he's got

808
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,820
something "special"
planned for me.

809
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,238
We don't escape

810
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:31,739
and I just die
with everyone else.

811
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,074
I'm I missing
a choice here, Fallit?

812
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:34,284
KOT:
Be quiet, Quark.

813
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:46,671
They've dropped out of warp.

814
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:47,880
Go to impulse.

815
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,842
Sir, their gravity
generators are off.

816
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:52,385
Melora's alive.

817
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:54,179
Gravity's
been reinstated.

818
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:55,888
All engines are down.

819
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,265
Come on, Doctor.

820
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:11,488
I think we have
the situation

821
00:42:11,488 --> 00:42:13,572
in hand, Commander.

822
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,074
Sisko to<i> Rio Grande.</i>

823
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,201
Everything's
under control.

824
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:17,285
We're going home.

825
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:18,661
O'BRIEN:
<i>Aye, Commander.</i>

826
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,205
<i>Setting course</i>
<i>for the wormhole.</i>

827
00:42:27,337 --> 00:42:29,547
Why didn't
the phaser kill me?

828
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,840
Oh, I don't know.

829
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,675
Maybe all the
neurostimulants

830
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:35,011
we've been pumping
into your body.

831
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:37,180
That's what I was
wondering, too.

832
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,556
You know, it might make

833
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,683
an interesting side
effect to the treatment.

834
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,310
It's worth exploring...

835
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:47,440
Julian... I'm not going ahead
with the treatments.

836
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:49,817
Well, you can always
try it again someday

837
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,403
if you change your mind.

838
00:42:51,403 --> 00:42:54,822
I don't think I will.

839
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,699
I like being
independent.

840
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,743
But to give up
everything I am

841
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:03,456
to walk... on land...

842
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:05,583
well, I might be
more independent,

843
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,002
but I wouldn't
be Elaysian anymore.

844
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:10,380
I'm not sure what I'd be.

845
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:15,927
Besides, maybe independence
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

846
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,262
I kind of like how it feels

847
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:19,514
to be dependent on someone
for a change.

848
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:21,640
And I'm glad you
got me to unlock

849
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,226
the doors
to my quarters

850
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:27,146
so I could finally let someone
into my life.

851
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,689
So am I.
