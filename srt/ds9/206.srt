1
00:00:02,196 --> 00:00:05,931
Medical Log, Stardate 47229.1.

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,567
Chief O'Brien and I
have been working overtime

3
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:11,376
to prepare for the arrival
of a new cartographer.

4
00:00:11,414 --> 00:00:15,149
Ensign Melora Pazlar is the
first Elaysian to join Starfleet

5
00:00:15,188 --> 00:00:18,855
and, as such, requires
special accommodations.

6
00:00:18,896 --> 00:00:21,561
I haven't seen one
of these in 300 years.

7
00:00:21,602 --> 00:00:23,367
I'm surprised
it was even on file

8
00:00:23,405 --> 00:00:25,204
in the replicator's data bank.

9
00:00:25,242 --> 00:00:26,335
It isn't.

10
00:00:26,377 --> 00:00:28,643
Ensign Pazlar sent me
the specifications.

11
00:00:28,683 --> 00:00:30,083
She really uses one like this?

12
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:32,646
Her normal anti-grav unit
isn't going to work here.

13
00:00:32,691 --> 00:00:35,822
Same problem we had with
the Starfleet cargo lifts.

14
00:00:35,863 --> 00:00:38,562
Cardassian construction
just isn't compatible.

15
00:00:38,602 --> 00:00:39,900
Ops to Bashir.

16
00:00:39,938 --> 00:00:42,910
The <i>Yellowstone</i> has just
docked at Airlock 14, Doctor.

17
00:00:42,944 --> 00:00:44,846
We're on our way.

18
00:00:48,388 --> 00:00:51,189
Just think of what she's gone
through to get here, Jadzia.

19
00:00:51,227 --> 00:00:52,924
What it must be like
to adjust to our gravity

20
00:00:52,964 --> 00:00:55,264
after growing up on a planet
with such low surface gravity.

21
00:00:55,302 --> 00:00:57,602
Doctor, we've done
the best we can with the ramps.

22
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,008
The Cardassians obviously
didn't have her in mind

23
00:01:00,045 --> 00:01:01,377
when they built this place.

24
00:01:01,414 --> 00:01:04,011
Well, I've managed to modify
the maximum vertical clearance

25
00:01:04,053 --> 00:01:06,616
of the chair three centimeters,
to a slope of 56 degrees.

26
00:01:06,658 --> 00:01:07,887
Well, that still leaves
a lot of places

27
00:01:07,927 --> 00:01:09,122
around here
she won't have access to.

28
00:01:09,163 --> 00:01:10,563
Can't we just use
the transporter

29
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,590
to help her get around?

30
00:01:11,635 --> 00:01:12,967
It makes sense to me

31
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:15,942
but she sent word that it
wasn't acceptable to her.

32
00:01:15,977 --> 00:01:17,240
I wonder why.

33
00:01:17,279 --> 00:01:19,181
I know exactly why.

34
00:01:19,216 --> 00:01:20,650
She went through Academy
the same way.

35
00:01:20,686 --> 00:01:21,881
Once her basic needs are met

36
00:01:21,922 --> 00:01:23,892
she refuses
any special assistance.

37
00:01:23,926 --> 00:01:25,224
She's extraordinary.

38
00:01:25,262 --> 00:01:27,825
You make it sound as though
you've known her for years.

39
00:01:27,867 --> 00:01:29,803
I almost feel as though I have.

40
00:01:29,838 --> 00:01:33,471
I've pulled all her personnel
and medical files to get ready.

41
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:35,413
Her quarters...
they're ready, aren't they?

42
00:01:35,449 --> 00:01:37,749
I've got the bumps on the head
to prove it.

43
00:01:37,787 --> 00:01:38,948
Thanks, Chief.

44
00:01:38,989 --> 00:01:41,289
Let me know if there's
anything else I can do.

45
00:01:41,327 --> 00:01:44,926
That'll be something to see...
when we switch off the gravity

46
00:01:44,968 --> 00:01:46,870
and she flies around the room.

47
00:02:10,085 --> 00:02:12,613
Ensign Melora Pazlar
reporting for duty.

48
00:02:12,657 --> 00:02:13,886
Welcome to DS9, Ensign.

49
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:16,260
I'm Chief Science Officer
Jadzia Dax

50
00:02:16,297 --> 00:02:17,265
and this is...

51
00:02:17,299 --> 00:02:18,928
Dr. Bashir,
we spoke on subspace.

52
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:20,198
Good to meet you in person.

53
00:02:20,238 --> 00:02:21,570
I see you have my trolley car
ready to go.

54
00:02:21,607 --> 00:02:22,575
As requested.

55
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:23,577
Can I help?

56
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:25,513
I'm fine, thank you.

57
00:02:36,838 --> 00:02:37,999
That's better.

58
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,635
You've modified it.

59
00:02:39,678 --> 00:02:43,048
Yes, I wanted to give you
as much mobility as I could.

60
00:02:43,084 --> 00:02:44,347
I've been practicing

61
00:02:44,386 --> 00:02:46,754
on the model
I requested for a month.

62
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:47,817
Well, it's no problem.

63
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,989
We can replicate
the other design.

64
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:52,524
No, I'll just have to adapt.

65
00:02:57,947 --> 00:03:00,919
I will be accompanying you
on your survey mission.

66
00:03:00,953 --> 00:03:02,752
I really don't think that'll be
necessary, Lieutenant.

67
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,591
I'm perfectly capable
of piloting a runabout.

68
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:07,223
Commander Sisko
thought that it...

69
00:03:07,265 --> 00:03:08,996
I'm sure he thought
what every officer

70
00:03:09,036 --> 00:03:10,630
I've ever served with
has thought...

71
00:03:10,672 --> 00:03:13,108
that I need extra help
to get the job done.

72
00:03:13,144 --> 00:03:14,271
Please tell him I don't.

73
00:03:14,313 --> 00:03:16,783
Commander Sisko
wouldn't allow any Ensign

74
00:03:16,818 --> 00:03:18,344
to take a runabout
into the Gamma Quadrant

75
00:03:18,454 --> 00:03:19,444
the day after she arrives.

76
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,924
I'm sure
the Chief Science Officer

77
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,258
has more important
things to do

78
00:03:22,295 --> 00:03:24,926
than chart a sector
in the Gamma Quadrant.

79
00:03:24,968 --> 00:03:27,370
Um, here we are.

80
00:03:27,472 --> 00:03:28,906
You didn't modify
the specifications

81
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,376
I gave you for my quarters,
did you?

82
00:03:30,445 --> 00:03:31,572
Not one iota.

83
00:03:31,614 --> 00:03:33,982
You can control the gravity unit
with this device.

84
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:35,248
If you'd care to try it out...

85
00:03:35,288 --> 00:03:36,381
Thank you, I will.

86
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:39,225
It was a pleasure
meeting both of you.

87
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,407
Paltriss only created
80 of them, each a...

88
00:05:47,441 --> 00:05:49,138
a work of art.

89
00:05:49,178 --> 00:05:52,446
And I've come into
the possession of 42.

90
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:53,919
Forty-two?

91
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:57,684
My world will honor your name

92
00:05:57,728 --> 00:06:00,198
for returning
the rings of Paltriss

93
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,566
to his birthplace.

94
00:06:01,603 --> 00:06:02,628
Honor my name all you like

95
00:06:02,672 --> 00:06:04,403
as long as your honor
is accompanied

96
00:06:04,442 --> 00:06:08,348
by 199 bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

97
00:06:11,723 --> 00:06:14,057
I heard you drive
a hard bargain.

98
00:06:14,095 --> 00:06:17,295
Shall we celebrate
our closing the deal

99
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,964
with another drink?

100
00:06:24,749 --> 00:06:26,275
Excuse me.

101
00:06:27,355 --> 00:06:28,482
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:28,523 --> 00:06:29,684
We're not open yet

103
00:06:29,726 --> 00:06:31,525
but if you'll come back in...

104
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,331
Have another drink on me.

105
00:06:41,383 --> 00:06:44,617
Fallit Kot, is it really you?

106
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:47,684
How long has it been?

107
00:06:47,728 --> 00:06:51,132
Eight years.
Eight long years.

108
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:53,537
Oh, it can't be.

109
00:06:53,607 --> 00:06:58,140
I must say, you look terrific.

110
00:06:58,183 --> 00:06:59,412
Tanned, toned up...

111
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,615
all that baby fat
has disappeared

112
00:07:01,656 --> 00:07:02,885
from your face.

113
00:07:02,926 --> 00:07:05,523
You don't keep extra weight on
where I've been.

114
00:07:07,201 --> 00:07:08,430
Just passing through are you?

115
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,306
I bet you have business
in the Gamma Quadrant.

116
00:07:11,342 --> 00:07:13,835
You always had a sharp eye
for fresh territory.

117
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,350
Oh, I'm not going
to the Gamma Quadrant.

118
00:07:16,386 --> 00:07:18,856
My business is
right here with you.

119
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:19,949
With me?

120
00:07:19,993 --> 00:07:21,188
That's right.

121
00:07:24,335 --> 00:07:26,237
I've come to kill you, Quark.

122
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,313
I've gone through
her mission profile

123
00:07:35,357 --> 00:07:37,452
and she certainly seems
to know what she's doing.

124
00:07:37,495 --> 00:07:38,827
Nevertheless, this is

125
00:07:38,864 --> 00:07:40,230
her first deep
space assignment.

126
00:07:40,267 --> 00:07:41,930
And it doesn't make
sense to me to...

127
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:46,502
Here she is.

128
00:07:51,823 --> 00:07:53,291
Welcome, Ensign.

129
00:07:53,326 --> 00:07:56,093
I'm Commander Benjamin Sisko.

130
00:07:56,132 --> 00:07:57,795
Am I late?

131
00:07:57,835 --> 00:07:59,498
No, not at all.

132
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:02,272
It looked as though the meeting
had already begun.

133
00:08:02,311 --> 00:08:03,643
Dax and Bashir
were just telling me

134
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,513
about your request
to pilot a runabout alone.

135
00:08:08,957 --> 00:08:11,520
Wouldn't it have
been more appropriate

136
00:08:11,563 --> 00:08:13,931
to include me
in that conversation?

137
00:08:13,967 --> 00:08:15,561
I was getting a briefing

138
00:08:15,637 --> 00:08:17,766
by my senior officers, Ensign.

139
00:08:17,808 --> 00:08:20,803
We discuss personnel
matters all the time.

140
00:08:20,847 --> 00:08:23,785
I'm sorry if I seem
overly sensitive

141
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:28,090
but I'm used to being shut out
of the "Melora problem."

142
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:31,568
The truth is, there is
no "Melora problem"

143
00:08:31,603 --> 00:08:33,869
until people create one.

144
00:08:38,383 --> 00:08:39,874
This may sound ungrateful

145
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,755
because Dr. Bashir has
been wonderfully helpful

146
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,159
in the preparations
for my arrival

147
00:08:45,197 --> 00:08:48,260
but frankly, I wonder
why a medical opinion

148
00:08:48,303 --> 00:08:50,831
is necessary
in this discussion.

149
00:08:50,874 --> 00:08:52,844
Julian knows more
of your capabilities

150
00:08:52,878 --> 00:08:54,575
than any of us.

151
00:08:54,615 --> 00:08:57,348
I don't need a medical opinion
to tell me my own capabilities.

152
00:08:57,388 --> 00:08:58,856
- Ensign...
- I simply object

153
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:01,087
to being treated
like someone who is ill.

154
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:03,099
I don't see anybody doing that.

155
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:05,433
Try sitting in the
chair, Commander.

156
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:09,171
No one can understand
until they sit in the chair.

157
00:09:15,824 --> 00:09:17,453
I've been in one chair
or another

158
00:09:17,494 --> 00:09:18,928
since I left my home world.

159
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,470
My family gave me this cane.

160
00:09:22,504 --> 00:09:25,670
It's made from the wood
of a garlanic tree.

161
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,170
They had no idea
what it would be like

162
00:09:28,216 --> 00:09:29,309
to live off-world

163
00:09:29,352 --> 00:09:32,119
in what you consider
"normal" gravity.

164
00:09:32,157 --> 00:09:34,856
Only a handful of Elaysians
have ever left home

165
00:09:34,895 --> 00:09:37,560
but I always knew
that I had to be one of them.

166
00:09:37,601 --> 00:09:41,666
I dreamt about exploring
the stars as a child

167
00:09:41,776 --> 00:09:46,240
and I wasn't going to allow
any... handicap...

168
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:50,385
not a chair,
not a Cardassian station...

169
00:09:50,427 --> 00:09:53,126
to stop me
from chasing that dream.

170
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,999
You must feel
a great deal of pride

171
00:09:55,035 --> 00:09:56,800
about everything
you've achieved.

172
00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:59,071
And I've achieved that,
Commander

173
00:09:59,111 --> 00:10:01,513
without being dependent
on anybody.

174
00:10:01,549 --> 00:10:05,990
To be honest,
I prefer to work alone.

175
00:10:06,024 --> 00:10:07,857
It's simply easier for me.

176
00:10:09,198 --> 00:10:10,188
I am not comfortable

177
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:12,396
sending you alone
into the Gamma Quadrant.

178
00:10:12,438 --> 00:10:16,208
Sir... I can focus
on the job better.

179
00:10:16,245 --> 00:10:19,308
I-I can work at my own pace
without being a bother

180
00:10:19,351 --> 00:10:21,150
to anyone else.

181
00:10:21,189 --> 00:10:24,025
Lieutenant Dax will
be going with you.

182
00:10:27,401 --> 00:10:29,030
Yes, sir.

183
00:10:30,807 --> 00:10:33,141
When do you wish to leave,
Lieutenant?

184
00:10:34,348 --> 00:10:36,375
Your schedule is fine with me.

185
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:39,152
Then tomorrow at 0730.

186
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,489
Is it working?

187
00:10:57,528 --> 00:10:59,760
The low-grav
field actuator.

188
00:10:59,798 --> 00:11:01,768
I just heard it go off.

189
00:11:01,802 --> 00:11:03,499
It's working fine.

190
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,237
So you were just...

191
00:11:05,277 --> 00:11:07,008
Oh, um... for me

192
00:11:07,046 --> 00:11:10,577
it's like slipping
into a hot tub

193
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,251
at the end of a long day.

194
00:11:13,293 --> 00:11:14,990
Really?

195
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:19,263
I'm a shower man, myself.

196
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,738
Look at this.

197
00:11:24,715 --> 00:11:26,149
Is this your husband?

198
00:11:26,184 --> 00:11:27,413
Boyfriend?

199
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:32,192
Doctor, if you came
for an apology...

200
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,790
I apologize.

201
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,462
Apology?

202
00:11:35,503 --> 00:11:38,805
My speech wasn't intended
to attack you personally.

203
00:11:40,447 --> 00:11:44,251
I'm sure you never set out
to attack anyone personally

204
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:46,554
but you do seem to attack a lot.

205
00:11:46,592 --> 00:11:49,085
That's rather insensitive
of you, Doctor.

206
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,325
Julian.

207
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:52,269
I'm no longer your doctor.

208
00:11:52,304 --> 00:11:53,636
I see.

209
00:11:53,673 --> 00:11:55,666
You've decided I need a friend.

210
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,873
Ooh, was that an attack?

211
00:11:57,948 --> 00:12:01,011
You see, you do it so well,
with such charm

212
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,648
it's hard to tell.

213
00:12:04,628 --> 00:12:06,359
I really don't mean to...

214
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,392
Sure you do.

215
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,734
I beg your pardon?

216
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:11,435
Of course you mean to.

217
00:12:11,475 --> 00:12:13,882
All of these broad shots
you fire...

218
00:12:14,015 --> 00:12:15,040
they're just your way

219
00:12:15,084 --> 00:12:17,350
of keeping the rest of the
universe on the defensive.

220
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:18,687
Has to be.

221
00:12:18,725 --> 00:12:20,319
You're too good at it.

222
00:12:20,362 --> 00:12:21,762
Well, uh...

223
00:12:21,798 --> 00:12:25,293
it always seemed to work
pretty well.

224
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:27,332
Until now.

225
00:12:28,611 --> 00:12:31,742
Well, that is the nicest thing
you've said to me.

226
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,188
Or anybody else.

227
00:12:36,226 --> 00:12:37,455
Are you hungry?

228
00:12:38,865 --> 00:12:40,128
I came here

229
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:42,296
thinking about
asking you to dinner.

230
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:44,468
Then afterwards,
we'll go dancing

231
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,478
I suppose.

232
00:12:45,512 --> 00:12:46,707
Ooh, Red Alert.

233
00:12:50,455 --> 00:12:51,582
I'm sorry.

234
00:12:52,993 --> 00:12:54,359
Well, come on.

235
00:12:54,397 --> 00:12:57,563
There's a new Klingon
restaurant open on the Promenade

236
00:12:57,603 --> 00:12:59,596
if... you like
that sort of thing.

237
00:13:00,876 --> 00:13:02,573
All right.

238
00:13:23,421 --> 00:13:25,653
Dinner is served.

239
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:27,227
I didn't
order dinner.

240
00:13:27,261 --> 00:13:29,288
What better way to mollify...

241
00:13:30,535 --> 00:13:32,402
satisfy a hungry traveler

242
00:13:32,439 --> 00:13:35,843
than with a delicious
home-cooked meal?

243
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:41,322
Starting with a delicate
Vak clover soup.

244
00:13:52,613 --> 00:13:54,879
Why spoil your appetite
with soup?

245
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,080
Here's the real treat.

246
00:13:59,225 --> 00:14:04,293
Jumbo Vulcan mollusks
sautéed in rhombolian butter...

247
00:14:04,335 --> 00:14:07,432
a taste so exquisite,
it's to die for.

248
00:14:07,476 --> 00:14:08,808
Uh...

249
00:14:08,845 --> 00:14:10,313
or to live for, for that matter.

250
00:14:10,347 --> 00:14:13,878
Do you know dabo, Fallit?

251
00:14:13,922 --> 00:14:16,154
It's a wonderfully
entertaining game

252
00:14:16,193 --> 00:14:17,354
and easy to learn.

253
00:14:18,831 --> 00:14:20,824
I took the liberty of lining up

254
00:14:20,869 --> 00:14:23,203
a couple
of excellent tutors I know.

255
00:14:25,445 --> 00:14:26,674
Be sure to ask them

256
00:14:26,714 --> 00:14:29,515
about their "double down"
betting strategy.

257
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:36,895
If I haven't made it clear,
I intend your stay here

258
00:14:36,934 --> 00:14:41,467
to be as pleasurable
as you could ever imagine.

259
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,637
So...

260
00:14:43,748 --> 00:14:48,052
allow me to propose a toast.

261
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,616
To...

262
00:14:50,996 --> 00:14:52,659
old friends.

263
00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:54,794
Old debts.

264
00:14:57,174 --> 00:14:59,440
<i>Gagh Tek Or?</i>

265
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,812
Shall I order for us both?

266
00:15:00,849 --> 00:15:01,942
All right.

267
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,009
Um, let's see now.

268
00:15:03,053 --> 00:15:04,351
We'll have some <i>racht,</i>
of course.

269
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:05,618
<i>Racht...</i>

270
00:15:05,659 --> 00:15:07,356
And a double order

271
00:15:07,395 --> 00:15:09,695
of <i>gladst,</i> no sauce, please.

272
00:15:09,733 --> 00:15:11,430
<i>Gladst... usu bal.</i>

273
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:15,570
And a side order
of <i>zilm'kach.</i>

274
00:15:15,612 --> 00:15:17,707
Is that too much for two?

275
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:19,949
<i>Zilm'kach.</i>

276
00:15:22,526 --> 00:15:24,120
<i>Drak doo.</i>

277
00:15:24,162 --> 00:15:25,221
May I?

278
00:15:25,264 --> 00:15:26,664
Don't be alarmed.

279
00:15:28,103 --> 00:15:29,868
Excuse me, Julian,
I can't eat this.

280
00:15:29,907 --> 00:15:31,239
I know how it looks, but...

281
00:15:31,276 --> 00:15:33,212
<i>P'kar tel Durg Le Frakn'I?</i>

282
00:15:33,246 --> 00:15:34,680
<i>Dug a bul, rah'tar!</i>

283
00:15:34,717 --> 00:15:36,185
<i>D'tel klop a bul!</i>

284
00:15:36,219 --> 00:15:37,653
<i>Pak't pol!</i>

285
00:15:37,689 --> 00:15:39,318
<i>D'kar tel G'denna!</i>

286
00:15:42,398 --> 00:15:45,063
I like a customer
who knows what she wants.

287
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:53,444
<i>G'denna.</i>

288
00:15:53,488 --> 00:15:56,392
There's nothing worse
than half-dead <i>racht.</i>

289
00:16:04,643 --> 00:16:06,169
<i>Gagh Tek Or!</i>

290
00:16:15,364 --> 00:16:17,391
I was ten.

291
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:20,100
My father was
a Federation diplomat

292
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,269
on Invernia II.

293
00:16:22,311 --> 00:16:23,609
One day, when we were

294
00:16:23,648 --> 00:16:25,777
out on a remote
part of the planet

295
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:28,347
we were hit
by a massive ionic storm

296
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,826
and while we were
waiting it out

297
00:16:30,895 --> 00:16:34,995
we found an Invernian girl,
about my age, who was sick.

298
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:38,407
After the storm cleared,
my father went for help

299
00:16:38,443 --> 00:16:40,106
but it was too late.

300
00:16:40,147 --> 00:16:42,710
I sat there and watched her die.

301
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,847
The next day, when he returned

302
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:48,329
his guide told us that we
could have treated her

303
00:16:48,363 --> 00:16:51,802
with a simple herb
that was growing all around.

304
00:16:53,641 --> 00:16:55,440
I could have saved her life.

305
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:00,517
And so you started
to study medicine.

306
00:17:00,555 --> 00:17:05,053
Actually, first
I started to study tennis.

307
00:17:05,097 --> 00:17:06,258
Tennis?

308
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:08,565
I really thought I could
make a career out of it.

309
00:17:08,604 --> 00:17:09,970
You must be very good.

310
00:17:10,007 --> 00:17:11,806
Well, I used to think so

311
00:17:11,844 --> 00:17:15,248
but then I went to my
first major competition.

312
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,117
My opponent served first

313
00:17:17,154 --> 00:17:19,647
and I heard the ball
bounce past me.

314
00:17:19,693 --> 00:17:21,595
The computer announced
it was good

315
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,429
and I realized
I was in trouble.

316
00:17:23,466 --> 00:17:27,338
Turned out, I had more talent
at medicine than tennis.

317
00:17:37,094 --> 00:17:40,555
Well, I, um, have
an early mission tomorrow.

318
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:42,765
I better get some rest.

319
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,182
Of course.

320
00:18:08,056 --> 00:18:09,685
Dax to Pazlar.

321
00:18:11,764 --> 00:18:14,292
Computer,
level-1 security access.

322
00:18:15,404 --> 00:18:17,067
Ensign Pazlar?

323
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:21,744
Computer, locate
Ensign Melora Pazlar.

324
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:24,620
Docking Level 22, Section 14.

325
00:18:24,656 --> 00:18:26,216
Section 14?

326
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:39,915
We need to get you
to the Infirmary.

327
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:42,082
It's my own fault.

328
00:18:42,124 --> 00:18:43,353
I decided...

329
00:18:43,393 --> 00:18:45,693
I could use an extra
astrometric array

330
00:18:45,732 --> 00:18:48,202
after going through
the mission profile again.

331
00:18:48,236 --> 00:18:50,229
I came to the storage
bay to get one.

332
00:18:50,273 --> 00:18:52,709
My mind was already
in the Gamma Quadrant.

333
00:18:52,746 --> 00:18:54,739
I wasn't... paying
enough attention

334
00:18:54,783 --> 00:18:56,012
to what I was doing.

335
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:57,988
I guess my boot

336
00:18:58,022 --> 00:18:59,992
didn't make the lip
of the door.

337
00:19:00,026 --> 00:19:02,087
I fell on my controls.

338
00:19:02,131 --> 00:19:03,326
Dax to Bashir.

339
00:19:03,366 --> 00:19:06,167
Ensign Pazlar's had
a, uh, minor accident.

340
00:19:06,205 --> 00:19:07,571
We need to see you
in the Infirmary.

341
00:19:07,608 --> 00:19:09,805
Acknowledged.
I'll be there in three minutes.

342
00:19:09,846 --> 00:19:12,943
What kind of an architect
would deliberately design

343
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:15,651
a raised rim
at the entrance to every door?

344
00:19:18,567 --> 00:19:21,300
So much for the dangers
of the Gamma Quadrant.

345
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,242
I didn't even make it there.

346
00:19:23,277 --> 00:19:25,110
You will.

347
00:19:25,147 --> 00:19:26,172
There's no concussion.

348
00:19:26,216 --> 00:19:28,379
You can reschedule
your mission for tomorrow.

349
00:19:29,489 --> 00:19:31,083
It was so...

350
00:19:33,564 --> 00:19:37,197
Flopping back and forth
like a broken toy.

351
00:19:37,238 --> 00:19:39,766
I didn't want anyone
to find me like that

352
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,871
but I couldn't
get up by myself.

353
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:43,509
Why didn't you wait for Dax

354
00:19:43,551 --> 00:19:46,352
before you went into an area
that was unmodified with ramps?

355
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,790
I didn't need Dax

356
00:19:47,826 --> 00:19:50,023
if I'd just paid attention.

357
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:52,364
Melora...

358
00:19:52,402 --> 00:19:56,570
no one on this station
is completely independent.

359
00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:00,175
In space, we all depend
on one another to some degree.

360
00:20:00,217 --> 00:20:03,712
I just want you all to know
that you can depend on me.

361
00:20:03,758 --> 00:20:05,124
You've proven that.

362
00:20:05,161 --> 00:20:09,101
Now what do the rest of us
have to do to convince you?

363
00:20:09,135 --> 00:20:10,764
Of what?

364
00:20:10,806 --> 00:20:13,299
That you can depend on us.

365
00:20:17,418 --> 00:20:20,185
Have you ever heard of the work
Nathaniel Teros did

366
00:20:20,224 --> 00:20:22,353
with low gravity species
30 years ago?

367
00:20:22,395 --> 00:20:23,921
Neuromuscular adaptation.

368
00:20:23,965 --> 00:20:25,730
It had no practical
success at all.

369
00:20:25,769 --> 00:20:27,796
No, but the principles
were sound

370
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,434
and a lot of progress
has been made

371
00:20:29,476 --> 00:20:31,275
in neurochemistry since then.

372
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:34,285
You think some day
I could throw away the chair?

373
00:20:36,657 --> 00:20:38,854
Theoretically... perhaps.

374
00:20:44,339 --> 00:20:45,807
Would you like to come in?

375
00:20:45,842 --> 00:20:47,869
Oh, no, I know
how much you look forward

376
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,542
to turning down the gravity.

377
00:20:53,825 --> 00:20:55,727
Don't let that stop you.

378
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:06,305
You may want to brace yourself
until you get used to it.

379
00:21:27,024 --> 00:21:28,424
Come on, Julian.

380
00:21:34,874 --> 00:21:35,899
What do I do?

381
00:21:35,942 --> 00:21:38,003
Just give a gentle push.

382
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,309
It's easy.

383
00:21:42,722 --> 00:21:45,215
Oh... oh... oh...

384
00:21:45,261 --> 00:21:48,792
Oh, oh... Oh!

385
00:21:48,835 --> 00:21:51,500
This is astonishing!

386
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,410
I can't tell you how curious
I was about this.

387
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:56,980
Oh.

388
00:21:57,018 --> 00:21:58,418
Most people are.

389
00:21:58,453 --> 00:22:01,823
Sometimes they make me feel
like a carnival attraction.

390
00:22:01,861 --> 00:22:04,492
So usually I prefer
to keep everyone out.

391
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:07,436
Well, thank you...
for letting me in.

392
00:22:10,578 --> 00:22:12,241
He's my brother.

393
00:22:12,281 --> 00:22:14,148
Who?

394
00:22:19,395 --> 00:22:20,693
Oh.

395
00:23:02,682 --> 00:23:06,177
Setting course 28 mark 142.

396
00:23:06,222 --> 00:23:07,554
Confirmed.

397
00:23:11,901 --> 00:23:15,237
Computer...
any Vulcan études on file?

398
00:23:15,274 --> 00:23:17,540
Affirmative.

399
00:23:17,578 --> 00:23:20,516
If you have no objections.

400
00:23:20,551 --> 00:23:22,578
Computer, play us
something by Delvok.

401
00:23:24,425 --> 00:23:26,588
Delvok never seems Vulcan to me.

402
00:23:26,629 --> 00:23:29,658
There's too much... emotion
in his music.

403
00:23:32,008 --> 00:23:33,340
It's pretty.

404
00:23:39,255 --> 00:23:42,125
Tell me something, Lieutenant...

405
00:23:42,161 --> 00:23:46,899
you think there's room
for... romance in Starfleet?

406
00:23:46,937 --> 00:23:48,269
I think so.

407
00:23:48,306 --> 00:23:49,774
You've made it work?

408
00:23:49,809 --> 00:23:52,006
Mmm, now and then.

409
00:23:52,048 --> 00:23:53,915
I mean really work.

410
00:23:53,951 --> 00:23:56,251
Oh... really work.

411
00:23:56,289 --> 00:23:57,689
Yes.

412
00:23:57,758 --> 00:24:01,391
Well, for that,
I'd have to go back, um...

413
00:24:01,433 --> 00:24:02,731
150 years.

414
00:24:02,768 --> 00:24:04,168
Oh...

415
00:24:04,205 --> 00:24:05,868
that's a long time.

416
00:24:05,908 --> 00:24:10,281
Could it be that Dr. Bashir's
bedside manner has won you over?

417
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:17,155
Our species are just
so... different.

418
00:24:17,198 --> 00:24:19,532
Since when has that
ever stopped anyone?

419
00:24:19,569 --> 00:24:21,471
I knew
a hydrogen-breathing lothra

420
00:24:21,506 --> 00:24:24,205
who fell hopelessly in love
with an Oxygene.

421
00:24:24,245 --> 00:24:25,406
You're kidding.

422
00:24:25,447 --> 00:24:27,849
How could they even be
in the same room?

423
00:24:27,885 --> 00:24:30,686
40 minutes a day without
their breathing apparatus.

424
00:24:30,724 --> 00:24:31,692
That's all.

425
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:34,526
57 years they were together.

426
00:24:34,565 --> 00:24:38,026
What-What about...
career conflicts?

427
00:24:38,073 --> 00:24:40,543
Two friends of mine
from the Academy got engaged

428
00:24:40,577 --> 00:24:42,410
even though they knew
they were being assigned

429
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:43,416
to different starships.

430
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,611
Subspace relationships?

431
00:24:44,652 --> 00:24:45,620
Mm-hmm.

432
00:24:45,654 --> 00:24:47,248
Oh, that's a tough one.

433
00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:49,386
They may not be together
for a year or more

434
00:24:49,428 --> 00:24:51,557
and even then
for only a few weeks.

435
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:55,596
Love across light-years...
it's just so...

436
00:24:55,641 --> 00:24:57,372
It lacks intimacy.

437
00:24:57,411 --> 00:24:59,381
You could say that.

438
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:05,355
I finish my mission here,
I move on to the next one.

439
00:25:05,394 --> 00:25:08,833
What kind of future is that
for a romance?

440
00:25:08,867 --> 00:25:11,862
Look at the alternative.

441
00:25:13,476 --> 00:25:14,808
I guess.

442
00:25:20,824 --> 00:25:22,384
Oh, it's you.

443
00:25:22,428 --> 00:25:24,455
Don't be so happy to see me.

444
00:25:24,498 --> 00:25:26,024
All right, I won't.

445
00:25:26,069 --> 00:25:29,634
Odo, there's
a desperate criminal

446
00:25:29,675 --> 00:25:30,938
on board the station.

447
00:25:30,978 --> 00:25:33,506
You wouldn't be talking
about Fallit Kot

448
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:36,043
who just finished eight years
at a labor camp

449
00:25:36,089 --> 00:25:38,423
for hijacking a shipment
of Romulan ale

450
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,364
and whose name appears
right next to yours

451
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:42,731
on the original indictment?

452
00:25:42,768 --> 00:25:45,102
I had nothing to do
with the hijacking itself.

453
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:48,544
I was only the, uh... middleman.

454
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,777
Trafficking in stolen goods
should have been enough

455
00:25:50,884 --> 00:25:52,945
to get you your own cell
at that Romulan camp.

456
00:25:52,988 --> 00:25:56,951
Unless, of course,
you sold out your partner.

457
00:25:56,996 --> 00:26:00,561
I can honestly say
justice was served.

458
00:26:00,604 --> 00:26:02,699
I would imagine Fallit Kot

459
00:26:02,741 --> 00:26:05,770
is looking for his own
kind of justice now.

460
00:26:07,785 --> 00:26:09,618
He threatened to kill me.

461
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,355
What?

462
00:26:14,488 --> 00:26:15,820
Nothing.

463
00:26:15,857 --> 00:26:17,018
Just a passing thought.

464
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:18,892
Odo, he means it.

465
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:22,836
Nothing I do
seems to change his mind.

466
00:26:22,871 --> 00:26:24,362
You've got to do something.

467
00:26:24,408 --> 00:26:26,971
I'll do my job, Quark.

468
00:26:27,013 --> 00:26:28,812
Yeah.

469
00:26:31,322 --> 00:26:33,656
Unfortunately.

470
00:26:50,594 --> 00:26:51,755
<i>Racht,</i> anyone?

471
00:26:51,796 --> 00:26:52,957
I've been waiting for you.

472
00:26:52,998 --> 00:26:54,466
I've got something to show you.

473
00:26:56,305 --> 00:26:58,036
What is it?

474
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:00,272
It's a computer model
of an elevated neural output

475
00:27:00,313 --> 00:27:01,873
from the brain's
gross motor cortex.

476
00:27:01,916 --> 00:27:03,214
It's stimulating

477
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:06,189
acetylcholine absorption
to increase tensile strength.

478
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:07,819
The neuromuscular
adaptation theory?

479
00:27:07,861 --> 00:27:09,490
It was theory 30 years ago

480
00:27:09,532 --> 00:27:11,832
but with the development
of neo-analeptic transmitters

481
00:27:11,869 --> 00:27:13,235
it's not even that complicated.

482
00:27:13,273 --> 00:27:14,867
It's just
that no one's ever gone back

483
00:27:14,909 --> 00:27:16,708
to reexamine the ideas
of Nathaniel Teros.

484
00:27:16,746 --> 00:27:18,613
Until now.

485
00:27:20,019 --> 00:27:21,682
This...

486
00:27:21,722 --> 00:27:23,521
could actually work?

487
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,427
No more servo controls.

488
00:27:25,463 --> 00:27:26,989
No more chair.

489
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:01,266
Have I done something wrong?

490
00:28:01,302 --> 00:28:03,329
Not that I'm aware of.

491
00:28:05,343 --> 00:28:07,540
We have something in common.

492
00:28:07,581 --> 00:28:09,015
We do?

493
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:11,316
I don't like Quark either...

494
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,558
but I can't let you kill him.

495
00:28:14,595 --> 00:28:15,756
Kill him?

496
00:28:15,797 --> 00:28:18,769
Did he tell you
I was going to do that?

497
00:28:18,803 --> 00:28:21,239
I know of your history together.

498
00:28:21,275 --> 00:28:24,145
Let bygones be bygones,
I always say.

499
00:28:25,717 --> 00:28:29,248
And I always say you can
tell a man's intentions

500
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:30,817
by the way he walks.

501
00:28:32,564 --> 00:28:34,329
How do I walk?

502
00:28:34,368 --> 00:28:38,172
Like someone carrying a lot
of weight on his shoulders.

503
00:28:38,208 --> 00:28:40,508
Must be the memory
of those Romulan bricks

504
00:28:40,547 --> 00:28:42,015
I carried for eight years.

505
00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:44,076
Must be.

506
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:49,461
But you can't lock a man up
for the way he walks, can you?

507
00:29:13,746 --> 00:29:15,009
Well?

508
00:29:15,048 --> 00:29:18,043
I'd say he's a man
with nothing to lose.

509
00:29:18,088 --> 00:29:19,454
As opposed to me.

510
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:23,124
I have no reason to hold him
for now and he knows it.

511
00:29:23,165 --> 00:29:25,067
I'll watch him the best I can

512
00:29:25,102 --> 00:29:27,869
but I suggest you carry
a combadge with you

513
00:29:27,908 --> 00:29:28,876
at all times.

514
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,378
Call me at the first
sign of trouble.

515
00:29:30,413 --> 00:29:33,681
What if the first sign
is the last sign?

516
00:29:33,719 --> 00:29:36,121
You people sell
pieces of yourself

517
00:29:36,157 --> 00:29:37,820
after you die, don't you?

518
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:38,920
Yes.

519
00:29:38,963 --> 00:29:40,454
I'll buy one.

520
00:29:45,443 --> 00:29:47,072
My heart is pounding.

521
00:29:47,112 --> 00:29:48,843
I'd like to think that
has more to do with me

522
00:29:48,883 --> 00:29:50,112
than the neo-analeptic infusion.

523
00:29:50,152 --> 00:29:53,090
Would that also explain
why my backside is getting warm?

524
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,787
Well, that's more likely
the result

525
00:29:54,828 --> 00:29:56,593
the neuromuscular
tissue stimulation

526
00:29:56,632 --> 00:29:59,034
due to the increased activity
in the motor cortex.

527
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:01,667
I'd say that's enough
first time out.

528
00:30:04,581 --> 00:30:05,640
It's good that you've already

529
00:30:05,683 --> 00:30:07,653
been using your muscles
in this gravity environment.

530
00:30:07,687 --> 00:30:09,087
It'll make it easier to adapt.

531
00:30:09,123 --> 00:30:10,717
Feel any different?

532
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,094
No.

533
00:30:13,131 --> 00:30:15,601
Nothing at all?

534
00:30:15,637 --> 00:30:17,937
I'm sorry, Julian.

535
00:30:21,715 --> 00:30:23,412
The acetylcholine absorption

536
00:30:23,452 --> 00:30:25,422
is precisely
at 14% above normal.

537
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:29,260
Increased tensile strength
would be the inevitable result.

538
00:30:29,297 --> 00:30:30,526
Julian?

539
00:30:35,576 --> 00:30:37,478
I can lift my leg.

540
00:30:37,514 --> 00:30:40,714
Your neural pathways
are beginning to adapt.

541
00:30:40,753 --> 00:30:44,123
Endurance and coordination
might take a while

542
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:49,068
but we should have you walking
within the hour.

543
00:30:55,349 --> 00:30:57,216
How's the upgrade coming?

544
00:30:57,252 --> 00:30:59,085
We've been able to get it
to about 70%

545
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:00,854
of what we'd get
with a standard EPS

546
00:31:00,893 --> 00:31:02,692
but it looks like
that's going to be...

547
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:05,498
Well, I'll be damned.

548
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,042
I wanted to give you

549
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:11,512
our first day's mission summary
myself, Commander.

550
00:31:11,548 --> 00:31:13,279
A pleasure, Ensign.

551
00:31:14,755 --> 00:31:16,657
Julian, how did you, uh?

552
00:31:16,692 --> 00:31:18,525
Oh, it was simply a matter
of increasing the output

553
00:31:18,596 --> 00:31:19,689
on the brain's motor cortex.

554
00:31:19,731 --> 00:31:21,097
Someone else's research,
actually.

555
00:31:21,134 --> 00:31:22,865
I just dotted the I's
and crossed the T's.

556
00:31:22,904 --> 00:31:23,929
Well, you'll get your name

557
00:31:23,973 --> 00:31:25,533
in the medical journals
for this one.

558
00:31:25,643 --> 00:31:26,542
Yeah, I know, I...

559
00:31:26,645 --> 00:31:27,704
Julian...

560
00:31:27,747 --> 00:31:29,147
I don't know
how to tell you this

561
00:31:29,183 --> 00:31:30,549
but I'm not sure
I can make it...

562
00:31:30,653 --> 00:31:31,882
Easy does it now.

563
00:31:31,922 --> 00:31:34,553
It's just the first day's
treatment beginning to wear off.

564
00:31:34,594 --> 00:31:35,562
Thank you.

565
00:31:35,596 --> 00:31:36,689
Nothing to be concerned about.

566
00:31:36,732 --> 00:31:38,326
Look, I better get you
back to your quarters.

567
00:31:38,368 --> 00:31:39,997
I want you to get a good
night's rest tonight.

568
00:31:40,038 --> 00:31:41,006
Oh, thank you.

569
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,634
Habitat Ring, Level 14.

570
00:31:49,156 --> 00:31:53,096
With each progressive treatment,
you should get stronger

571
00:31:53,131 --> 00:31:55,762
and the effects
should last longer.

572
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,233
What about this?

573
00:31:59,276 --> 00:32:00,939
A low-grav environment now

574
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,611
would really confuse
your motor cortex.

575
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,122
I understand.

576
00:32:11,033 --> 00:32:12,296
Julian...

577
00:32:14,306 --> 00:32:17,472
You let me fly
for the first time.

578
00:32:18,983 --> 00:32:21,580
I let you walk.

579
00:32:21,688 --> 00:32:23,156
We're even.

580
00:32:27,567 --> 00:32:29,058
I'll see you in the morning.

581
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:43,361
Lights.

582
00:32:46,872 --> 00:32:48,170
Computer, turn on...

583
00:33:02,082 --> 00:33:03,050
Quark to Odo...

584
00:33:03,084 --> 00:33:04,713
No one can hear you, Quark.

585
00:33:04,755 --> 00:33:06,053
It's just you and me.

586
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,616
Fallit.

587
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:10,632
Oh, I wasn't prepared
to entertain this evening

588
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:12,329
but make yourself at home.

589
00:33:12,369 --> 00:33:13,632
Oh, I already have.

590
00:33:13,672 --> 00:33:15,437
What's mine is yours.

591
00:33:15,475 --> 00:33:16,738
All you have to do is ask.

592
00:33:16,779 --> 00:33:18,339
I'm tired of your gifts, Quark.

593
00:33:18,381 --> 00:33:21,820
All I want
is your miserable life.

594
00:33:21,855 --> 00:33:24,383
Wait!
Everything's negotiable.

595
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:27,098
Believe me...

596
00:33:27,199 --> 00:33:29,101
I'm worth much more
to you alive.

597
00:33:29,136 --> 00:33:30,195
How's that?

598
00:33:30,238 --> 00:33:34,474
How does 199 bars

599
00:33:34,514 --> 00:33:37,486
of gold-pressed latinum
sound to you?

600
00:33:43,766 --> 00:33:45,565
It's a start.

601
00:33:55,355 --> 00:33:57,154
The mattress felt like rocks

602
00:33:57,192 --> 00:34:00,323
and every one of my muscles
ached all night long.

603
00:34:00,365 --> 00:34:03,496
You'll adjust to that
after a few more treatments.

604
00:34:03,538 --> 00:34:07,205
This time the effects
should last for several hours.

605
00:34:11,722 --> 00:34:15,126
Exactly when does this
become irreversible?

606
00:34:15,195 --> 00:34:18,965
Melora...
if you're not certain...

607
00:34:19,003 --> 00:34:20,096
No, I'm sure it's just

608
00:34:20,138 --> 00:34:22,631
some strange form
of buyer's remorse.

609
00:34:22,677 --> 00:34:23,872
I'll be fine.

610
00:34:23,913 --> 00:34:27,249
Tell me exactly
what you're feeling.

611
00:34:30,425 --> 00:34:32,588
Last night, I just missed...

612
00:34:35,435 --> 00:34:37,598
I didn't feel like me.

613
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:40,177
If you want to end
your dependence

614
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:43,183
on the chair
and the servo controls

615
00:34:43,284 --> 00:34:45,618
you're going to have to give up
the low-grav environment.

616
00:34:45,656 --> 00:34:47,853
You knew
that that was the trade-off.

617
00:34:47,894 --> 00:34:49,864
And it seemed like a good trade.

618
00:34:49,898 --> 00:34:52,495
Until I realized
I couldn't do it anymore.

619
00:34:52,536 --> 00:34:54,062
If I could just spend...

620
00:34:54,106 --> 00:34:57,078
I'm just concerned
that going back and forth

621
00:34:57,112 --> 00:35:00,745
could ultimately lead
to a loss of fine motor control.

622
00:35:00,786 --> 00:35:02,049
Meaning?

623
00:35:02,089 --> 00:35:04,321
Your ability to perform
complex tasks

624
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,521
could be affected.

625
00:35:09,336 --> 00:35:12,831
The effects are fully reversible
for the next few days.

626
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:15,781
We can pull the plug
at any time before then.

627
00:35:15,816 --> 00:35:17,843
But after that, if all goes well

628
00:35:17,887 --> 00:35:21,348
your motor cortex impulses
will kick in on their own.

629
00:35:21,394 --> 00:35:22,794
Permanently.

630
00:35:34,654 --> 00:35:37,147
It's starting to wear off again.

631
00:35:47,446 --> 00:35:49,712
I don't understand myself.

632
00:35:49,751 --> 00:35:53,350
How could I possibly
have second thoughts?

633
00:35:53,391 --> 00:35:56,261
This would mean
real independence.

634
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:59,302
It's everything
I ever wished for.

635
00:36:00,973 --> 00:36:02,909
But then I start
to think about home

636
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:05,107
and how I won't ever
be able to go back.

637
00:36:05,148 --> 00:36:07,084
Well, maybe just
for a short visit

638
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:11,423
but... never really go back.

639
00:36:14,266 --> 00:36:16,463
<i>The Little Mermaid.</i>

640
00:36:17,672 --> 00:36:18,970
Mermaid?

641
00:36:19,009 --> 00:36:21,947
It's an Earth fable
by Hans Christian Andersen.

642
00:36:21,982 --> 00:36:25,421
She trades
her magical life under the sea

643
00:36:25,455 --> 00:36:28,427
for a pair of legs
to walk on land.

644
00:36:29,864 --> 00:36:32,357
Didn't she live
happily ever after?

645
00:36:45,228 --> 00:36:47,995
Ashrok.
Right on time.

646
00:36:50,038 --> 00:36:53,910
May I present my longtime
business partner, Fallit Kot.

647
00:37:00,592 --> 00:37:02,960
For your inspection.

648
00:37:09,209 --> 00:37:11,236
Exquisite.

649
00:37:14,219 --> 00:37:16,689
Then our transaction
is complete.

650
00:37:16,724 --> 00:37:18,090
Not quite.

651
00:37:18,127 --> 00:37:20,290
I'll be taking them, too.

652
00:37:20,331 --> 00:37:21,799
They warned me about you!

653
00:37:21,835 --> 00:37:23,133
Not true!

654
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:26,301
A deal is a deal...
Rule of Acquisition Number 16.

655
00:37:26,343 --> 00:37:27,470
Kot...

656
00:37:27,512 --> 00:37:29,072
you got what you came for.

657
00:37:29,116 --> 00:37:30,414
Now let's be reasonable.

658
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:36,329
Pick it up.
Pick it up!

659
00:37:36,363 --> 00:37:37,524
Move!
Hurry up!

660
00:37:37,566 --> 00:37:39,934
Move! Move!

661
00:37:39,971 --> 00:37:41,269
Let's go.

662
00:37:44,613 --> 00:37:48,074
Priority-1 Security
to Level 22, Section 5.

663
00:37:55,869 --> 00:37:57,930
I'm sure Julian
would understand.

664
00:37:57,974 --> 00:37:59,967
Besides, he can still
publish the results

665
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:01,742
from your first treatments.

666
00:38:03,117 --> 00:38:04,312
Both of you...
back in the ship.

667
00:38:04,353 --> 00:38:05,685
Let's go!

668
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,258
Move it!

669
00:38:11,266 --> 00:38:13,293
Come on, move it!

670
00:38:13,337 --> 00:38:15,830
Now, get us out of here.

671
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,003
He's already shot a man.

672
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:18,013
Do as he says.

673
00:38:18,047 --> 00:38:19,174
I'll just wait in the back.

674
00:38:19,216 --> 00:38:20,742
In the front,
where I can see you.

675
00:38:20,785 --> 00:38:21,753
There... hurry up.

676
00:38:21,787 --> 00:38:23,187
I'm moving as fast as I can!

677
00:38:23,224 --> 00:38:24,351
She's an Elaysian.

678
00:38:24,393 --> 00:38:27,126
She needs motor support
in our gravity.

679
00:38:29,069 --> 00:38:30,230
They're in the <i>Orinoco.</i>

680
00:38:30,271 --> 00:38:33,368
Docking clamps have been
released, thrusters engaged.

681
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:35,711
Ready a tractor beam,
open a channel.

682
00:38:35,748 --> 00:38:36,773
Open.

683
00:38:36,818 --> 00:38:38,788
This is
Commander Benjamin Sisko.

684
00:38:38,822 --> 00:38:41,088
Return to the station at once.

685
00:38:41,126 --> 00:38:42,789
No reply.

686
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:45,164
Engage the tractor beam.

687
00:38:47,105 --> 00:38:50,009
They've locked onto us
with the tractor beam.

688
00:38:50,044 --> 00:38:52,344
Open the channel
to that Commander of yours.

689
00:38:53,384 --> 00:38:55,820
Release this ship
or I'll kill a hostage.

690
00:38:55,856 --> 00:38:57,519
I'm willing to negotiate
your freedom

691
00:38:57,559 --> 00:38:59,426
but first release those...

692
00:38:59,529 --> 00:39:01,431
Didn't you hear
what I just said?

693
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:07,368
No, I have something special
in mind for you.

694
00:39:17,665 --> 00:39:19,396
Do I make myself clear?

695
00:39:19,436 --> 00:39:22,636
Release the ship now.

696
00:39:22,675 --> 00:39:24,577
Doctor, Chief... with me.

697
00:39:24,613 --> 00:39:26,207
Beam us to the <i>Rio Grande.</i>

698
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:27,411
Give us ten seconds

699
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:29,079
and then disengage
the tractor beam.

700
00:39:29,122 --> 00:39:30,454
Understood.

701
00:39:32,862 --> 00:39:34,125
Energizing.

702
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:42,071
They've released us.

703
00:39:42,115 --> 00:39:44,585
Through the wormhole.

704
00:40:06,408 --> 00:40:07,376
What was that?

705
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:08,435
I'm not sure.

706
00:40:08,479 --> 00:40:09,742
What was it?

707
00:40:09,781 --> 00:40:12,480
Another ship coming
through the wormhole.

708
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,579
Take us to warp.

709
00:40:13,622 --> 00:40:15,990
We haven't even
set a course yet.

710
00:40:16,028 --> 00:40:17,691
I don't care about the course,
just go to warp.

711
00:40:17,731 --> 00:40:19,667
If we don't set a course

712
00:40:19,701 --> 00:40:22,673
we could warp ourselves
into oblivion.

713
00:40:22,707 --> 00:40:24,370
Fine, set a course.

714
00:40:24,411 --> 00:40:26,574
Just get us out of here.

715
00:40:26,615 --> 00:40:28,778
They're powering up
their warp drive.

716
00:40:28,853 --> 00:40:29,946
Stay with them.

717
00:40:29,989 --> 00:40:31,720
Engaging warp engines.

718
00:40:31,759 --> 00:40:34,229
Can we beam them
aboard at warp?

719
00:40:34,264 --> 00:40:36,291
I wouldn't recommend that.

720
00:40:49,361 --> 00:40:51,160
Get the phasers ready.

721
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,634
I'm not going
to fire at them.

722
00:40:53,669 --> 00:40:56,266
Oh, you'll do it or you'll die.

723
00:40:56,308 --> 00:40:57,834
It's your choice.

724
00:40:57,944 --> 00:41:00,176
Fine.

725
00:41:00,216 --> 00:41:02,379
Then I hope
you can fly this ship.

726
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:06,360
Just sit down
and do what I told you. Now.

727
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:10,668
Quark, how well
do you know this man?

728
00:41:10,703 --> 00:41:13,937
We've been friends for years,
not counting today.

729
00:41:13,977 --> 00:41:15,206
Well I suggest you
explain to him

730
00:41:15,246 --> 00:41:17,273
that Starfleet
isn't going to give up

731
00:41:17,317 --> 00:41:18,615
and stop chasing us.

732
00:41:18,652 --> 00:41:19,677
That's true, Fallit.

733
00:41:19,721 --> 00:41:21,691
You don't know
these Starfleet types.

734
00:41:21,725 --> 00:41:23,592
Then we'll all die.

735
00:41:24,764 --> 00:41:26,961
Great, we escape and he's got

736
00:41:27,003 --> 00:41:28,996
something "special"
planned for me.

737
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,338
We don't escape

738
00:41:30,376 --> 00:41:31,776
and I just die
with everyone else.

739
00:41:31,812 --> 00:41:33,007
I'm I missing
a choice here, Fallit?

740
00:41:33,048 --> 00:41:34,175
Be quiet, Quark.

741
00:41:44,971 --> 00:41:46,702
They've dropped out of warp.

742
00:41:46,742 --> 00:41:47,767
Go to impulse.

743
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:50,873
Sir, their gravity
generators are off.

744
00:41:50,917 --> 00:41:52,511
Melora's alive.

745
00:41:52,554 --> 00:41:54,319
Gravity's been reinstated.

746
00:41:54,357 --> 00:41:55,848
All engines are down.

747
00:41:55,893 --> 00:41:57,361
Come on, Doctor.

748
00:42:09,788 --> 00:42:13,592
I think we have the situation
in hand, Commander.

749
00:42:13,629 --> 00:42:14,597
Sisko to <i>Rio Grande.</i>

750
00:42:14,631 --> 00:42:15,860
Everything's under control.

751
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,868
We're going home.

752
00:42:16,902 --> 00:42:18,200
Aye, Commander.

753
00:42:18,238 --> 00:42:20,265
Setting course for the wormhole.

754
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:29,619
Why didn't the phaser kill me?

755
00:42:29,661 --> 00:42:30,890
Oh, I don't know.

756
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:32,797
Maybe all the neurostimulants

757
00:42:32,834 --> 00:42:34,997
we've been pumping
into your body.

758
00:42:35,038 --> 00:42:37,099
That's what I was
wondering, too.

759
00:42:37,143 --> 00:42:38,406
You know, it might make

760
00:42:38,445 --> 00:42:40,847
an interesting side
effect to the treatment.

761
00:42:40,883 --> 00:42:42,317
It's worth exploring...

762
00:42:42,353 --> 00:42:47,386
Julian... I'm not going ahead
with the treatments.

763
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:49,798
Well, you can always
try it again someday

764
00:42:49,834 --> 00:42:51,531
if you change your mind.

765
00:42:51,571 --> 00:42:54,839
I don't think I will.

766
00:42:54,878 --> 00:42:56,745
I like being independent.

767
00:42:56,782 --> 00:43:03,558
But to give up everything I am
to walk... on land...

768
00:43:03,595 --> 00:43:05,690
well, I might be
more independent

769
00:43:05,733 --> 00:43:07,999
but I wouldn't
be Elaysian anymore.

770
00:43:08,037 --> 00:43:10,600
I'm not sure what I'd be.

771
00:43:12,613 --> 00:43:15,881
Besides, maybe independence
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

772
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,388
I kind of like how it feels

773
00:43:17,423 --> 00:43:19,586
to be dependent on someone
for a change.

774
00:43:19,627 --> 00:43:21,654
And I'm glad you
got me to unlock

775
00:43:21,698 --> 00:43:23,189
the doors to my quarters

776
00:43:23,235 --> 00:43:27,175
so I could finally let someone
into my life.

777
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:28,873
So am I.

778
00:43:30,081 --> 00:43:39,192
<i>Aler acht'jar,</i>
<i>Aler acht'jar</i>

779
00:43:39,234 --> 00:43:46,944
<i>T'lembda boool-gah toh-gal</i>

780
00:43:46,982 --> 00:43:55,329
<i>Aler acht'jar,</i>
<i>Aler acht'jar</i>

781
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:58,338
<i>T'lembda boool-gah</i>
<i>to lohh...</i>

782
00:43:58,372 --> 00:44:00,399
Oh, you must be exhausted.

783
00:44:00,442 --> 00:44:02,309
Uh, if you don't want to stay...

784
00:44:02,346 --> 00:44:05,045
No, let's just sit
a while and listen.

785
00:44:05,084 --> 00:44:11,290
<i>Rom ara Rom Rom-rom</i>

786
00:44:11,331 --> 00:44:17,640
<i>T'el Do'a, Do'a...</i>

787
00:44:17,677 --> 00:44:21,242
I want to remember all of this.

788
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:23,143
<i>Rom ara Rom Rom-rom...</i>

789
00:44:23,142 --> 00:44:26,912
<i>Rom ara Rom Rom-rom...</i>
