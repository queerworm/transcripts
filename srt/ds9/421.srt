1
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,347
Here they are.

2
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:14,389
Welcome.

3
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:19,102
PADD:
Recording.

4
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:22,356
Character sketches
for possible stories.

5
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,774
A Bolian

6
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:25,693
tries to impress
a dabo girl

7
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,152
by wearing a toupee.

8
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:32,783
A thief disguises
himself as a monk

9
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:34,827
so he can swindle a Ferengi.

10
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,623
A woman...

11
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:41,416
traveling alone.

12
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,671
She's come a long way.

13
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:08,485
(<i> sobbing</i> )

14
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,821
Lwaxana?

15
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,490
Oh, hello, Odo.

16
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,993
You've been crying.

17
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:19,079
I can't help it.

18
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,497
Why?

19
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,250
Because...

20
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:28,296
I'm pregnant.

21
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,251
It's a miracle.

22
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:33,212
I never thought
I could have another baby.

23
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:36,758
Then those were tears
of happiness.

24
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:41,555
I won't let him do it, Odo.

25
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,515
Who? What?

26
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:45,851
My husband, Jeyal.

27
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,728
He wants to take my baby.

28
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,270
That's why I ran away.

29
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,565
Please, Lwaxana,
try to be calm.

30
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:52,566
Now, tell me.

31
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,984
Why would your husband

32
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,319
want to take your
baby from you?

33
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,445
He's Tavnian.

34
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,489
And...?

35
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,910
They believe in strict
separation of the sexes.

36
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,162
Boys are raised by men,
girls by women.

37
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,873
Why, those poor children
aren't even told

38
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:10,209
the other sex<i> exists</i>
until they're 16.

39
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:13,003
And your child is male.

40
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,963
Uh-huh, and the day

41
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,132
Jeyal found out, he said
that he was going

42
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:20,510
to take my baby away from me
as soon as he was born.

43
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,471
Well, I told him that
that isn't what we agreed--

44
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,473
that he had said that it was
going to be different with us

45
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,934
because<i> I</i> wasn't Tavnian.

46
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,685
But he changed his mind.

47
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,520
During our
wedding ceremony,

48
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,816
he spoke so beautifully
about why he wanted to marry me,

49
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,611
but afterwards...
it was as if I had become

50
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,613
a piece of property
in his eyes.

51
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,698
So you ran away.

52
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,618
And it wasn't easy, believe me.

53
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,078
Toward the end, I was

54
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:48,288
practically a prisoner
in my own house.

55
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:52,126
Well, now that you've
shown your husband

56
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:55,712
how determined you are
to be part of your boy's life,

57
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:59,967
perhaps he'll reconsider
his position.

58
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,551
Oh, no, not Jeyal.

59
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,345
He's the most willful man
I've ever met.

60
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:07,891
Oh! I'm so tired.

61
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:12,395
I've never needed a friend
more than I do right now.

62
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,231
(<i> sighing</i> )

63
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,900
I... appreciate your situation,

64
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,069
and I would like to help...

65
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,738
I knew you would.

66
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,741
You're such a dear, sweet man.

67
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:30,164
Unfortunately, I'm
also a very busy man.

68
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:33,292
Oh, believe me, Odo,
the last thing I want

69
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:35,127
is to become a burden to you.

70
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:37,712
I know how you value
your privacy.

71
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,089
All I want is a quiet place

72
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,675
where I can have my baby
in peace.

73
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,844
I was about to suggest
the very thing.

74
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,680
I'll find out when the next
transport leaves for Betazed.

75
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,556
Oh, I couldn't
possibly go there.

76
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,642
That's the first place
Jeyal will look for me.

77
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:52,311
I know him.

78
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:54,521
He won't give up,
not until he finds me

79
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,481
and gets his son back.

80
00:05:56,481 --> 00:06:00,277
That's why I came to you,
because I knew you'd protect me.

81
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:04,572
You<i> will</i> protect me,
won't you, Odo?

82
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,431
You're a writer.

83
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,895
I could see
you were somewhere else--

84
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,981
someplace you were inventing.

85
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,734
I'm, uh, working on a story.

86
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:44,696
I can spot a creative soul
a galaxy away.

87
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,742
My name is Onaya.

88
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,618
Jake Sisko.

89
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,329
Do you live here?

90
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,122
Yes.

91
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,457
I love
Cardassian architecture--

92
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,710
the way
things flow together.

93
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,003
Kell used to say

94
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:03,006
that every element
had to be of a piece

95
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,967
yet have a beauty all its own.

96
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,762
Tavor Kell, the architect?

97
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,931
I knew him
when he was in exile.

98
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,807
What was he like?

99
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:13,975
Shy.

100
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:17,187
Unsure of himself
and his talent.

101
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:21,983
Most people would never notice
someone like him,

102
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:25,362
but I have a weakness
for artists.

103
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:29,699
You wouldn't think
he was shy from his designs.

104
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,995
When I first met him,
they were as timid as he was.

105
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:37,707
I was always telling him
to stop censoring himself.

106
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,085
He must have
listened to you.

107
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:44,464
I've found artists
have a weakness for me as well.

108
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,509
At least, I hope they do.

109
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:55,016
I, uh... I've always wondered
what Kell would have designed

110
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,476
if he had lived longer.

111
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:01,273
He accomplished more
in the years that he had

112
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:04,318
than most people could
in a dozen lifetimes.

113
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:07,779
His name is known
throughout the Quadrant.

114
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:11,074
His buildings will stand
for centuries to come.

115
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:14,035
Isn't that
what an artist wants--

116
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,288
to be remembered?

117
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,459
Isn't that why you write?

118
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:22,877
I don't know.

119
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:26,131
I think it's mostly because
I like to tell stories.

120
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:29,176
There's no reason
to hide your ambition, Jake.

121
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,636
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

122
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:35,182
I think it's what makes
artists so compelling.

123
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,184
All right.

124
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:40,145
I-I guess I do want
to be remembered.

125
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:44,149
So what are you doing
to make sure you will be?

126
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:49,488
Well, I'm thinking of going to
the Pennington School on Earth.

127
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:52,866
You already have
the talent inside you.

128
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,826
I can see it.

129
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:57,120
You just need someone

130
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,082
to help you bring it
to the surface.

131
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,792
How?

132
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,669
There are ways.

133
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,963
Exercises.

134
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,590
Techniques.

135
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,219
Can you show them to me?

136
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:16,764
Come to my quarters tonight.

137
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,061
I'll be there.

138
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,208
Are you packed?

139
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,335
Kasidy's ship is going
to be here any minute.

140
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:47,421
Dad, I-I was thinking
about staying home.

141
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:48,796
Staying home?
This trip was your idea.

142
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:49,923
I know.

143
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,008
You mean, you really
want to pass up

144
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,844
three days
in the Bajoran outback?

145
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,388
I thought maybe you and Kasidy

146
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:58,432
would have a better time
without me.

147
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:01,642
Oh, lay off
the matchmaking, Jake.

148
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,686
Kasidy and I are doing fine.

149
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,813
It's not just that.

150
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:08,400
I'm also working on this story,

151
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,527
and I don't want to lose
my concentration.

152
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,195
You can write
on the trip.

153
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:16,157
Look, I'm not trying
to talk you into anything.

154
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,868
I don't get leave often,
and I was looking forward

155
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,162
to the three of us
spending time together.

156
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:25,208
Me, too, but...
I really need to focus on this.

157
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,626
All right.

158
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,044
Good luck with it.

159
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,047
(<i> sighs</i> )

160
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,883
See you in
a couple of days.

161
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,892
My marriage was a sham.

162
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,812
What I'd mistaken for love...

163
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,773
was nothing more
than a prison.

164
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,318
So... tell me.

165
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,570
Where are you girls headed?

166
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,489
Oh.

167
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:56,906
A holosuite.

168
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:00,118
King Arthur's court.

169
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,579
Camelot.

170
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,914
Love betrayed...

171
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,502
Dreams...

172
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:10,128
shattered.

173
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:11,505
Look at them.

174
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:13,340
You'd think somebody died.

175
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,426
I don't know if it's because
she's Betazoid or what,

176
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,219
but her mood is contagious.

177
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,764
As soon as she walked in here,
things started getting quiet.

178
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,518
Well, what do you
want me to do about it?

179
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:26,853
Either cheer her up
or get her to leave,

180
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:30,023
because if you don't,
I'm going to throw her out.

181
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,572
(<i> clearing throat</i> )

182
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:39,199
Odo.

183
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,326
Won't you join the party?

184
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:44,496
Actually, I have
some free time,

185
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:46,414
and I was wondering

186
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:49,376
if you wanted
to take a walk.

187
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,002
I would.

188
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:53,213
I meant Lwaxana.

189
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:56,257
I would love to.

190
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,342
Sorry.

191
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:58,843
Maybe next time.

192
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,684
I'm so depressed.

193
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:10,480
Kestra was six years old
when she died.

194
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,400
My sweet little girl.

195
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:18,488
I lost my parents,
a sister, a husband.

196
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:19,947
But nothing...

197
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:22,158
nothing compared
to losing her.

198
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,327
Uh...

199
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:27,372
I didn't mean
to carry on like that.

200
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:28,540
I'm sorry.

201
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,709
No, don't apologize.

202
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,751
I think I finally
understand

203
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:34,629
why you're so determined

204
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:37,882
not to let your husband
take the baby from you.

205
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,427
These are your quarters,
aren't they?

206
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,136
Yes.

207
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,264
Right next to yours.

208
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,224
My replicator is acting up.

209
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:49,018
Would you mind terribly if,
if we popped in

210
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,730
so I could get a cup
of Gavaline tea?

211
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,275
Of course not.

212
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:05,285
Uh, the replicator
is right over here.

213
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,079
I'll let Chief O'Brien
know about yours.

214
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,247
Oh, I already did.

215
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,582
He said he'd get to it

216
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,041
as soon as he could.

217
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:15,295
Gavaline tea.

218
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:18,423
Is, um... is this
for shape-shifting?

219
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,841
Yes.

220
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:24,554
Actually, most people
think it's a sculpture.

221
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:27,181
Well, what do
most people know?

222
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,433
Thank you.

223
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:35,940
May I ask you
something, Odo?

224
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,609
Are you over her?

225
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:40,278
Don't worry.

226
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:44,157
I'm not going to throw myself
at you if you say yes.

227
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:51,956
Major Kira
and First Minister Shakaar

228
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,832
are involved now.

229
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,960
How sad.

230
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,004
Not at all.

231
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,923
I'm happy for her.

232
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,885
Well, just don't
go do what I did--

233
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,972
look for someone
to fix your broken heart,

234
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,517
then end up pregnant
and on the run.

235
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,435
Ah...

236
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:16,523
I don't think there's
much danger of that happening.

237
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,524
(<i> chuckles</i> )

238
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,066
(<i> gasps</i> )

239
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,778
What is it?

240
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,780
The baby kicked.

241
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,574
May I sit down for a minute?

242
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:29,243
I, I... I don't
have any furniture.

243
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,329
The floor will do.

244
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,122
Oh.

245
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,424
(<i> sighs</i> )

246
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,553
Uh, how are you
feeling now?

247
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,095
Like a changeling

248
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,640
who's had to hold
his shape too long.

249
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,850
Ah.

250
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,018
Well, I, uh...

251
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,604
I think I know
how that feels.

252
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,773
Oh...

253
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:01,150
he's moving.

254
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,904
Here. You want to feel?

255
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,489
There.

256
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,661
Yes.

257
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,913
Oh.

258
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,040
Oh, I'm so tired, Odo.

259
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,960
I don't think I've had
a decent night's sleep

260
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,504
in weeks.

261
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,134
Sometimes,
with Betazoid babies,

262
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:31,138
you can actually
sense their thoughts.

263
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,018
Oh, such contentment.

264
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:39,773
(<i> sighs</i> )

265
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,441
Yes...

266
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,276
I can feel it, too.

267
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,781
You know,
someone once said,

268
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:52,452
"Life is a search to find
the peace you once had

269
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,662
when you were safe
inside your mother."

270
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,876
I didn't have a mother.

271
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:02,128
Oh...

272
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,922
don't worry, it's all right.

273
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:07,801
You'll find your peace...

274
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,636
just the same.

275
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,851
Lwaxana?

276
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,352
Hmm?

277
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,939
Your replicator
isn't really broken,

278
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:22,231
is it?

279
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,858
No.

280
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:30,197
I'm sorry
if I made you feel unwelcome.

281
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,574
It's...

282
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:34,243
it's just my way...

283
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,749
Lwaxana?

284
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,156
Yes?

285
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,116
It's Jake... Jake Sisko.

286
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,702
Remember me?

287
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,163
Come in.

288
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,002
I, uh...

289
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:26,796
I brought some of my stories
for you to read.

290
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,840
I don't need to.

291
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,090
Oh.

292
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,885
I thought maybe...

293
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:35,137
It's what you're going
to be writing next

294
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,597
that interests me.

295
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:41,019
You seem nervous, Jake.

296
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:43,855
Maybe a little.

297
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:46,273
That's understandable.

298
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:50,236
You should be nervous
when you start something new.

299
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,906
Although maybe
not this nervous.

300
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:54,949
Haven't you
ever been alone

301
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:57,577
in a woman's
quarters before?

302
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:01,748
Whatever you're thinking,
put it out of your mind.

303
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,457
You're here to work.

304
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,710
Now...

305
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:12,091
what's the most ambitious story
you ever wanted to tell?

306
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,218
I have an idea for a novel.

307
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,930
It's sort of autobiographical.

308
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,974
The main character's
mother dies.

309
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,976
It's not about that, really.

310
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:24,353
It's about
a lot of things.

311
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:27,941
So many, it all seems
so big to you right now.

312
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:31,235
You're afraid
that you can't do it justice.

313
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,404
Yeah.

314
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:38,284
But I'll bet you know
what the first line is.

315
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,954
How'd you know that?

316
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:43,998
I have something
I want to show you.

317
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,796
Revalus used it
when he wrote<i> The Wait.</i>

318
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,213
You knew him?

319
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,841
I have a weakness
for artists.

320
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,051
I told you that.

321
00:18:57,011 --> 00:19:00,389
I want you to have it.

322
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:05,103
I don't know what to say.
Thank you.

323
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:06,896
There's more.

324
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,943
Here...

325
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:13,903
JAKE:
Paper?

326
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,825
I've never worked
on paper before.

327
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,284
Revalus used to say

328
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,954
that "a writer should
put pen to paper

329
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:26,582
as if he were a painter
putting brush to canvas."

330
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,836
It's a part of what
he called "visceral writing."

331
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,462
What's that?

332
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:34,048
It's one of the techniques
I told you about.

333
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:36,884
Can you teach it to me?

334
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,345
That's why you're here.

335
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:43,016
Isn't it?

336
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,436
The opening line
of your novel...

337
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,063
write it down.

338
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:52,191
(<i> pen scratching across paper)</i>

339
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:02,702
Now keep going.

340
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,244
What do you mean,
"keep going"?

341
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:06,580
Write whatever
comes to you.

342
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,834
The idea is to create
a stream of consciousness

343
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,752
and see where
that takes you.

344
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,629
You can edit later.

345
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:18,092
Just write the first thing
that comes to mind.

346
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:20,386
I won't look.

347
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:23,472
Let the words
tumble out of you.

348
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,725
Don't censor them.

349
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,853
Feel the pen...

350
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:30,437
in your hand...

351
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,773
the texture of the paper.

352
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:36,443
Let yourself fall
into a rhythm.

353
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,740
You feel where
my thumbs are?

354
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,824
Mm-hmm.

355
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,617
That's your
foramen magnum.

356
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,412
It's a focal point

357
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:49,082
for the body's
bioelectric field.

358
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:52,710
There's another one...

359
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,212
here.

360
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:58,507
The Vulcans call
them<i> qui'lari.</i>

361
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:04,138
The Indians of ancient Earth
called them<i> chakras.</i>

362
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:09,894
I know how to stimulate them
to make you feel restful...

363
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:12,939
or energized...

364
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,232
or even...

365
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,359
creative.

366
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:23,323
This isn't bad.

367
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:27,703
I told you
I could help you.

368
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:32,166
Let the words...

369
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,376
flow, Jake.

370
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,637
Let them flow.

371
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,483
Yes...

372
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,946
that's it.

373
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:07,160
Let them flow.

374
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,903
There you are.

375
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:43,988
(<i> gasps</i> )

376
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,537
(<i> chuckling</i> ):
Got you that time.

377
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,582
That's not fair.

378
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,210
I didn't know
you could do surfaces.

379
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,086
Well, now you do.

380
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,629
Shall we try again?

381
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,215
Are you sure you're up to it?

382
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:04,050
Oh, absolutely.

383
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:07,720
I haven't had so much fun
in months.

384
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,929
Really?

385
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:12,350
Neither have I.

386
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,559
Security to Odo.

387
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,353
Go ahead.

388
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:17,521
A transport just arrived
from the Umani sector.

389
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:20,149
The man you asked us
to look out for was on it.

390
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:21,692
Acknowledged.

391
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:23,944
You know what to do.
Aye, sir.

392
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,363
It's my husband, isn't it?

393
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:26,322
Stay here.

394
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:28,199
I'll handle this.

395
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:38,042
You'd better have a good reason
for dragging me in like this.

396
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:40,294
I'm Chief of
Station Security.

397
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:42,588
That's all the
reason I need.

398
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:45,383
Well, well.

399
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:47,009
You're the changeling.

400
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:49,345
Odo... if I remember correctly.

401
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:50,428
And what of it?

402
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:52,556
Lwaxana told me
all about you.

403
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:55,268
How you broke her heart.

404
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:58,354
Strange she'd come running
to you for protection.

405
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:01,899
Her pregnancy must have her
confused, poor woman.

406
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:03,901
I find her remarkably
clear-headed.

407
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,361
She doesn't want to see you,

408
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,738
so you might as well
turn around and go home.

409
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:09,031
I've come a long way.

410
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:11,491
I'm not leaving here
empty-handed.

411
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,493
She is not going back with you.

412
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,204
I am not talking
about her.

413
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:17,206
I'm talking about my son.

414
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:20,084
I intend to see
that he is raised by men--

415
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:22,878
not by the pampering foolishness
of women.

416
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,380
I hate to disappoint you,

417
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,591
but Lwaxana has no intention
of giving him up to you.

418
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,927
Her intentions
do not concern me.

419
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:32,888
As her husband,
I have a legal right to my son.

420
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:37,475
I've been familiarizing myself
with Tavnian laws.

421
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:40,562
It's well established
that the male child

422
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:43,607
is considered the property
of the mother's husband.

423
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:46,902
Exactly.

424
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,029
Not the child's father.

425
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,906
The mother's husband.

426
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,908
By the time Lwaxana gives birth,

427
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,828
<i>you</i> won't be her husband.

428
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,747
We're getting married?

429
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:02,126
If you take me as your husband
in a legal Tavnian ceremony,

430
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:05,212
your marriage to Jeyal
will automatically be annulled,

431
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,631
and he'll lose his claim
to the baby.

432
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:11,093
I-I... I don't quite
know what to say.

433
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:13,595
I'm... well, I'm
just touched

434
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:16,015
by your willingness
to do this for me.

435
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:17,891
Well, it's not so much, really.

436
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:20,353
We'll remain husband and wife
for a few months,

437
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:22,188
long enough to satisfy
Tavnian law,

438
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:25,607
and then get an annulment
of our own.

439
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:30,321
It's not as if I was planning
to marry someone else.

440
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:35,868
Even so... thank you.

441
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:39,330
There is one thing
I don't understand.

442
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:43,167
Jeyal insisted on staying
to witness the ceremony.

443
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,294
He did?

444
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,923
Is that a problem?

445
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,926
In a, uh, Tavnian wedding,

446
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,762
the groom must stand
before the bride

447
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:58,724
and tell her why he wants
to marry her.

448
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:02,186
And then, in front
of his family and friends,

449
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:05,022
he must proclaim
his love for her,

450
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:09,443
and convince her
to accept him as her husband.

451
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:12,738
Well, I trust I can count on you
to accept me,

452
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:15,115
even if I just stand there
and read last week's

453
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,950
criminal activity report.

454
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:21,455
Um... no, no, no, you don't
quite understand.

455
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:26,210
If anyone present
doubts the groom's sincerity,

456
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:29,380
they can challenge the validity
of the marriage.

457
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:39,765
You mean... I have to convince
Jeyal that I want to marry you?

458
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:44,103
(<i> sighs</i> )

459
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:47,314
(<i> sighs</i> )

460
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:55,114
I've never been able
to write like this.

461
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:57,116
Ideas are coming so fast.

462
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,825
I can barely keep up
with them.

463
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:02,413
It's amazing, isn't it?

464
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:07,834
(<i> gasping</i> )

465
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:15,593
Jake...

466
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:16,760
It's okay.

467
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,636
It's just a nosebleed.

468
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:20,931
You should rest.

469
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:22,891
I'll be all right.

470
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,811
It's already stopped.

471
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,854
Where was I?

472
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:42,620
Did I miss something?
I didn't know Odo was getting
married till this morning.

473
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,622
I'm not sure he knew either.

474
00:27:44,622 --> 00:27:46,290
Who's he?

475
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:50,127
KIRA:
I think that's
Lwaxana's husband.

476
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,631
Good of him to come.

477
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:02,640
Well...

478
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,975
I'm so glad you
could make it.

479
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:06,852
I'm sure you are.

480
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:09,480
It's not too late
to call this off.

481
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,649
Your dignity's
important to you.

482
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:13,233
I understand that.

483
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,611
I would not want
anyone to see me

484
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:18,572
go through a charade
like this.

485
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:20,949
If you don't mind,

486
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:24,328
this is a very special
moment for me.

487
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:28,790
(<i> door opens</i> )

488
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:49,395
(<i> clears throat</i> )

489
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,692
In keeping with
Tavnian tradition,

490
00:28:54,692 --> 00:28:58,028
I stand before you
here in my home,

491
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:00,489
among my worldly possessions,

492
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:03,992
and declare my wish
to add this woman

493
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,827
to that which is mine.

494
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,121
She is as kind as
she is beautiful

495
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:11,083
and I want her to be

496
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:14,253
part of my life
from this day on.

497
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:15,546
Marry me, Lwaxana.

498
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:17,339
Am I the only one

499
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:20,342
who finds this a pale
declaration of love?

500
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:22,678
You could be talking
about any woman!

501
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:25,347
Lwaxana is not
just any woman!

502
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:26,973
Not to me.

503
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:30,102
Then prove it to us.

504
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,153
(<i> clears throat</i> )

505
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,241
(<i> sighs</i> )

506
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:49,037
Before I met her...

507
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,497
my world was...

508
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:54,793
a much smaller place.

509
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,211
I kept to myself.

510
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,255
I didn't need
anyone else,

511
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:00,299
and I took pride
in that.

512
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,925
The truth is...

513
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:06,138
I was ashamed of what I was.

514
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:12,561
Afraid that if people saw
how truly different I was,

515
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:14,521
they would recoil from me.

516
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:19,192
Lwaxana saw how
different I was...

517
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:22,195
and she didn't recoil.

518
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:26,283
She wanted to see more.

519
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:31,288
For the first time
in my life...

520
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,208
someone wanted me
as I was.

521
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,254
And that changed me...

522
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,547
forever.

523
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:45,385
The day I met her

524
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:49,598
is the day I stopped
being alone.

525
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:59,232
And I want her
to be part of my life

526
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,276
from this day on.

527
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:05,823
Marry me, Lwaxana.

528
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:09,201
Let me into your light.

529
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,121
Lwaxana?

530
00:31:14,665 --> 00:31:17,042
I give myself to you...

531
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:22,172
forever and always.

532
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:26,051
I say for all to hear
that this woman is mine.

533
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:28,887
If anyone challenges
my claim to her,

534
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,973
let them do so now.

535
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:42,735
I present to you...

536
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:45,028
my beloved wife.

537
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,740
(<i> applause</i> )

538
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:53,829
Odo.
Chief.

539
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:56,415
Congratulations.
Congratulations.

540
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,628
Congratulations.

541
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,380
Well done.

542
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:08,761
I...

543
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:10,970
cherished you, Lwaxana.

544
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:14,683
You were my most
treasured possession.

545
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:18,311
Take care of our son.

546
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:21,106
When he asks...

547
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:22,941
speak well of me.

548
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,366
(<i> chuckling</i> )

549
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,497
Ladies and gentlemen,
please do me the honor

550
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,541
of accompanying me
to my humble establishment.

551
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:41,585
I'm throwing a party
for the happy couple.

552
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:42,628
Quark?

553
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:43,587
What can I say?

554
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:44,797
I'm a hopeless romantic.

555
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:47,090
(<i> all chuckling</i> )

556
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:52,930
Are you all right?

557
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:56,850
We did it.

558
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,644
He's really leaving.

559
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:00,061
It would appear so.

560
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:03,690
Oh, Odo, you
were wonderful.

561
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,358
You know, for a minute there,

562
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:08,194
I really believed you
wanted to marry me.

563
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:11,156
I suppose that we should
tell them the truth...

564
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,742
but let's wait till
after the party.

565
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:20,499
Jake, you should rest.

566
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:23,293
Not now.

567
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:25,044
I'm on to something.

568
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:27,881
Your father will
be home soon.

569
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:30,049
You should be there.

570
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:32,093
I'll see him later.

571
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,597
Enough.

572
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:38,266
What'd you do that for?

573
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,727
You're pushing yourself
too hard.

574
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,020
No, I'm not.

575
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,730
My mind has never
been so clear.

576
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,565
Everything is
coming together.

577
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:48,318
At this rate, I can finish
this novel in a few days.

578
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:49,778
And you will.

579
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:51,363
I promise you.

580
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:55,158
But if you rest now,
your work will be even better.

581
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,161
All right.

582
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,413
I'll go home.

583
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,875
Maybe get some sleep.

584
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:05,669
You'll come back later?

585
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:07,796
Of course.

586
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:09,548
(<i> whispering</i> ):
I need you.

587
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:20,976

(<i> diners gasp</i> )

591
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:07,898
BASHIR:
Something has stimulated

592
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:11,026
Jake's brain functioning in
a way that I have never seen.

593
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:14,153
The capillaries in his cerebral
cortex have dilated 20 percent.

594
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:17,365
Neurotransmitter production
is up by at least that amount,

595
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,492
and neural activity
is off the scale.

596
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,327
Do you have any idea
what caused it?

597
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:22,412
Not yet, but it's
a good thing

598
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,081
we got him here
when we did.

599
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:26,374
His cortex was on the verge
of synaptic collapse.

600
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,209
But he<i> is</i> going
to be all right.

601
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,168
Mm-hmm.

602
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:30,670
I'd like to keep him

603
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,506
in the neural stabilization
field for a while.

604
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,634
Onaya.

605
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:37,594
Jake.

606
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:39,930
Where is she?

607
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:42,390
Jake, what happened?

608
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,645
I'm going to
talk to Odo,

609
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:50,023
see if he knows anything
about this Onaya.

610
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:52,442
I'll let you know
if his condition changes.

611
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:57,864
I'll be in the lab.

612
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,584
(<i> monitor beeps</i> )

613
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:24,182
(<i> grunts</i> )

614
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:32,398
Come with me, Jake.

615
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:35,276
It's time to finish...

616
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,570
what we started.

617
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,037
I'm picking up
concentrated traces

618
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:47,706
of some sort of psionic energy
in the bulkhead.

619
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,916
The tests I ran indicated
that Jake's mental activity

620
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,669
was stimulated by some kind
of psionic phenomenon,

621
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:55,421
possibly telepathic
in nature.

622
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,507
Then this entity
Nurse Tagana saw

623
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:59,051
could have been
responsible.

624
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:00,969
We have to find it,
then get Jake back

625
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:03,055
in the neural stabilization
field before it's too late.

626
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:05,098
I'll tell Odo to have
his search parties

627
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:07,642
reconfigure their tricorders
to scan for psionic energy.

628
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,435
That'll help,
but only for a while.

629
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:10,896
Psionic residue
decays within minutes.

630
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:12,313
Then we'd better
get moving.

631
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:19,571
ONAYA:
Keep going, Jake.

632
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,699

00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:27,037
The moment...

634
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:28,705
I saw you...

635
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:30,665
I knew you
were worthy

636
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:33,001
of what I could
give you.

637
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:36,421
But I can't stay
with you forever.

638
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:39,257
This is your chance...

639
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,051
to create something

640
00:37:41,051 --> 00:37:46,098
that will live on
long after you're gone.

641
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:54,522
There...

642
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,691

about 20 meters
in this direction.

647

I'll go this way.

You swing around
and take Tunnel 61-G.

649
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:24,552
What's wrong?

650
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:27,430
I-I can't...

651
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:29,975
Let me help you.

652
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:38,150
That's better,
isn't it?

Dad, don't--
don't interfere.

656
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:55,083
I said get away!

Go ahead.

Lock on
to my signal

660
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:07,345
and stand by
to beam Jake

661
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,721
directly
to the Infirmary.

662
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:11,057
You're too close
to the reactor core.

663
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:13,810
There's so much interference,
I can't get a lock.

664
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,645
Get a medical team
down here immediately.

665
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:16,688
Aye, sir.

666
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,606
What<i> are</i> you?

667
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,441
It's not what I am that matters.

668
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:21,901
It's what I do.

669
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:24,403
You don't know
the minds I've touched--

670
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:26,823
Catullus, Tarbolde, Keats...

671
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:28,407
a hundred others.

672
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,327
I unlocked their potential.

673
00:39:30,327 --> 00:39:31,953
Is that what you did to Jake?

674
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:32,996
Look at him!

675
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:35,165
They all die in the end,

676
00:39:35,165 --> 00:39:38,417
but look what I gave them
in return-- immortality.

677
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:40,879
Their names
will live on forever.

678
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,464
And you--
what do you get out of it?

679
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:47,719
What I need to survive,
so I can go on, find others,

680
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:51,056
and unlock their talents
as well.

681
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:53,766
He was the youngest
I ever found.

682
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,434
So eager...

683
00:39:55,434 --> 00:40:00,648
ready to give everything
he had in one great burst.

684
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,567
What a waste.

685
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:07,613
I will never forget you, Jake.

686
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:11,450
You're not going anywhere.

687
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:31,012
I have
wonderful news.

688
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,513
There's a transport
for Betazed

689
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:33,723
leaving this afternoon.

690
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:36,142
I'm going home.

691
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,853
I thought you were planning
on having the baby here.

692
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,230
If I did,

693
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,689
I'd end up staying
for months,

694
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,149
and that wouldn't be fair.

695
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:45,484
I've imposed
on you enough.

696
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,989
Lwaxana...

697
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:52,658
you could deliver
at any time now,

698
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:55,412
and it's a long way
to Betazed.

699
00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:57,372
You really should stay.

700
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:01,667
I'll miss you, too.

701
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:04,296
Then why leave?

702
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:09,884
You've gotten used
to having me around,
haven't you?

703
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,391
Oh, you dear,
sweet man.

704
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,059
Don't you see?

705
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:21,646
What you want is company,
someone to take care of.

706
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,775
Is that so wrong?

707
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:27,568
No, of course not.

708
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:31,739
The problem is, I want much
more than that from you.

709
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,992
You see, I can't help it.

710
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:36,786
I'm still in love with you.

711
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:39,998
And as much as I wish that
you were in love with me,

712
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:41,540
I know you're not.

713
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,712
I could stay.

714
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,923
I could try to make you
fall in love with me,

715
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:53,052
but we both know
that won't happen.

716
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:55,513
Then I'd end up
resenting you,

717
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:58,141
and our friendship
is far too important

718
00:41:58,141 --> 00:42:00,226
for me to let that happen.

719
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:03,313
That's why it's better
for both of us

720
00:42:03,313 --> 00:42:04,439
if I leave now.

721
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:19,371
Good-bye, husband.

722
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:22,207

(<i> door opens</i> )

726
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:40,933
How are you feeling?

727
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,060
(<i> sighs</i> )

728
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,769
Okay, I guess.

729
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:45,771
You've read it?

730
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:47,815
I just finished.

731
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,901
What do you think?

732
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:52,737
You've got a good start
on a novel here, Jake.

733
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:56,199
The dialogue is sharp,
the story's involving,

734
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:58,368
the characters are real.

735
00:42:58,368 --> 00:43:00,495
The spelling is terrible.

736
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,456
I especially like the father.

737
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:05,250
Remind you of anyone?

738
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,043
A bit.

739
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:08,753
It's really good.

740
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,256
I know.

741
00:43:11,256 --> 00:43:12,424
I just wish I wrote it.

742
00:43:12,424 --> 00:43:13,883
You did.

743
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:15,427
How can I be sure?

744
00:43:15,427 --> 00:43:16,719
I mean, without Onaya...

745
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:17,720
Listen to me.

746
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,597
You wrote these words, not her.

747
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:22,267
But she got them
out of me.

748
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:25,644
Which means they were somewhere
inside of you.

749
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:28,356
And all you have to do

750
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:30,525
is to learn to find
them for yourself.

751
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:34,153
You're right.

752
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:35,613
But I got to tell you.

753
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,782
I don't feel up to writing
just yet.

754
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:39,409
That's understandable.

755
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:41,369
Take it easy for a while.

756
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:42,954
You'll get back to it.

757
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:45,664
And then, someday...

758
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:48,834
when you're ready,
maybe you'll finish it.

759
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:50,920
Sounds like a plan.

760
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:55,633
I've got to get to work.

761
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,219
I'll check in on you
in a couple of hours.

762
00:43:58,219 --> 00:43:59,596
I'll be here.
