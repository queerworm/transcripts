1
00:00:12,883 --> 00:00:14,648
Here they are.

2
00:00:14,687 --> 00:00:15,712
Welcome.

3
00:00:18,561 --> 00:00:20,029
Recording.

4
00:00:20,064 --> 00:00:23,332
Character sketches
for possible stories.

5
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,809
A Bolian tries to impress
a dabo girl

6
00:00:26,844 --> 00:00:28,370
by wearing a toupee.

7
00:00:30,585 --> 00:00:33,716
A thief disguises
himself as a monk

8
00:00:33,758 --> 00:00:35,921
so he can swindle a Ferengi.

9
00:00:39,002 --> 00:00:40,562
A woman...

10
00:00:40,605 --> 00:00:42,598
traveling alone.

11
00:00:44,647 --> 00:00:46,810
She's come a long way.

12
00:01:09,462 --> 00:01:11,898
Lwaxana?

13
00:01:11,934 --> 00:01:14,497
Oh, hello, Odo.

14
00:01:14,539 --> 00:01:17,067
You've been crying.

15
00:01:17,111 --> 00:01:20,106
I can't help it.

16
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,641
Why?

17
00:01:22,656 --> 00:01:24,455
Because...

18
00:01:27,465 --> 00:01:29,492
I'm pregnant.

19
00:03:28,946 --> 00:03:30,848
It's a miracle.

20
00:03:30,884 --> 00:03:34,254
I never thought
I could have another baby.

21
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,855
Then those were tears
of happiness.

22
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:42,501
I won't let him do it, Odo.

23
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,476
Who? What?

24
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,946
My husband Jeyal.

25
00:03:46,982 --> 00:03:48,611
He wants to take my baby.

26
00:03:48,685 --> 00:03:50,245
That's why I ran away.

27
00:03:50,289 --> 00:03:52,521
Please, Lwaxana,
try to be calm.

28
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,619
Now, tell me.

29
00:03:53,695 --> 00:03:57,328
Why would your husband
want to take your baby from you?

30
00:03:57,369 --> 00:03:58,598
He's Tavnian.

31
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:00,437
And?

32
00:04:00,476 --> 00:04:01,569
They believe

33
00:04:01,611 --> 00:04:03,706
in strict separation
of the sexes.

34
00:04:03,749 --> 00:04:06,151
Boys are raised by men,
girls by women.

35
00:04:06,187 --> 00:04:08,715
Why, those poor children
aren't even told

36
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:11,195
the other sex exists
until they're 16.

37
00:04:11,231 --> 00:04:13,998
And your child is male.

38
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:16,006
Uh-huh, and the day

39
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,942
Jeyal found out, he said
that he was going

40
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:21,314
to take my baby away from me
as soon as he was born.

41
00:04:21,351 --> 00:04:24,255
Well, I told him that
that isn't what we agreed...

42
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,453
that he had said that it was
going to be different with us

43
00:04:26,494 --> 00:04:27,962
because I wasn't Tavnian.

44
00:04:27,998 --> 00:04:29,558
But he changed his mind.

45
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,433
During our wedding ceremony

46
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:35,741
he spoke so beautifully
about why he wanted to marry me

47
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,513
but afterwards...
it was as if I had become

48
00:04:38,552 --> 00:04:40,647
a piece of property in his eyes.

49
00:04:40,756 --> 00:04:42,749
So you ran away.

50
00:04:42,794 --> 00:04:45,561
And it wasn't easy, believe me.

51
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:46,931
Toward the end, I was

52
00:04:46,969 --> 00:04:49,439
practically a prisoner
in my own house.

53
00:04:49,473 --> 00:04:53,038
Well, now that you've
shown your husband

54
00:04:53,081 --> 00:04:56,680
how determined you are
to be part of your boy's life

55
00:04:56,721 --> 00:05:01,025
perhaps he'll reconsider
his position.

56
00:05:01,064 --> 00:05:02,498
Oh, no, not Jeyal.

57
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:05,300
He's the most willful man
I've ever met.

58
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:08,800
Oh! I'm so tired.

59
00:05:08,846 --> 00:05:13,379
I've never needed a friend
more than I do right now.

60
00:05:15,292 --> 00:05:17,785
I... appreciate your situation

61
00:05:17,831 --> 00:05:20,097
and I would like to help...

62
00:05:20,135 --> 00:05:22,663
I knew you would.

63
00:05:22,706 --> 00:05:25,837
You're such a dear, sweet man.

64
00:05:26,882 --> 00:05:31,220
Unfortunately,
I'm also a very busy man.

65
00:05:31,257 --> 00:05:34,286
Oh, believe me, Odo,
the last thing I want

66
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,993
is to become a burden to you.

67
00:05:36,034 --> 00:05:38,631
I know how you value
your privacy.

68
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,163
All I want is a quiet place

69
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,678
where I can have my baby
in peace.

70
00:05:42,713 --> 00:05:44,876
I was about to suggest
the very thing.

71
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:47,685
I'll find out when the next
transport leaves for Betazed.

72
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:49,590
Oh, I couldn't
possibly go there.

73
00:05:49,627 --> 00:05:51,620
That's the first place
Jeyal will look for me.

74
00:05:51,664 --> 00:05:52,927
I know him.

75
00:05:52,967 --> 00:05:55,530
He won't give up,
not until he finds me

76
00:05:55,572 --> 00:05:57,371
and gets his son back.

77
00:05:57,409 --> 00:06:01,406
That's why I came to you,
because I knew you'd protect me.

78
00:06:01,451 --> 00:06:05,687
You will protect me,
won't you, Odo?

79
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,605
You're a writer.

80
00:06:33,782 --> 00:06:35,752
I could see
you were somewhere else...

81
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:39,053
someplace you were inventing.

82
00:06:39,093 --> 00:06:41,690
I'm, uh, working on a story.

83
00:06:41,731 --> 00:06:45,831
I can spot a creative soul
a galaxy away.

84
00:06:47,376 --> 00:06:49,869
My name is Onaya.

85
00:06:49,915 --> 00:06:51,578
Jake Sisko.

86
00:06:51,617 --> 00:06:53,348
Do you live here?

87
00:06:53,388 --> 00:06:55,017
Yes.

88
00:06:55,058 --> 00:06:57,494
I love
Cardassian architecture...

89
00:06:57,529 --> 00:06:59,658
the way things flow together.

90
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,929
Kell used to say

91
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:03,840
that every element
had to be of a piece

92
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:07,211
yet have a beauty all its own.

93
00:07:07,249 --> 00:07:09,846
Tavor Kell, the architect?

94
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:12,187
I knew him when he was in exile.

95
00:07:12,226 --> 00:07:14,059
What was he like?

96
00:07:14,096 --> 00:07:15,223
Shy.

97
00:07:15,265 --> 00:07:18,396
Unsure of himself
and his talent.

98
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:23,039
Most people would never notice
someone like him

99
00:07:23,081 --> 00:07:26,451
but I have a weakness
for artists.

100
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:30,951
You wouldn't think
he was shy from his designs.

101
00:07:30,997 --> 00:07:35,199
When I first met him,
they were as timid as he was.

102
00:07:35,238 --> 00:07:38,973
I was always telling him
to stop censoring himself.

103
00:07:39,013 --> 00:07:41,313
He must have listened to you.

104
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:45,951
I've found artists
have a weakness for me as well.

105
00:07:47,596 --> 00:07:49,998
At least, I hope they do.

106
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:56,169
I, uh... I've always wondered
what Kell would have designed

107
00:07:56,213 --> 00:07:57,807
if he had lived longer.

108
00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:02,553
He accomplished more
in the years that he had

109
00:08:02,592 --> 00:08:05,621
than most people could
in a dozen lifetimes.

110
00:08:05,665 --> 00:08:09,001
His name is known
throughout the Quadrant.

111
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,478
His buildings will stand
for centuries to come.

112
00:08:12,512 --> 00:08:15,382
Isn't that
what an artist wants...

113
00:08:15,418 --> 00:08:17,786
to be remembered?

114
00:08:19,626 --> 00:08:21,994
Isn't that why you write?

115
00:08:22,032 --> 00:08:24,195
I don't know.

116
00:08:24,236 --> 00:08:27,538
I think it's mostly because
I like to tell stories.

117
00:08:27,576 --> 00:08:30,548
There's no reason
to hide your ambition, Jake.

118
00:08:30,582 --> 00:08:32,950
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

119
00:08:32,986 --> 00:08:36,551
I think it's what makes artists
so compelling.

120
00:08:36,594 --> 00:08:38,621
All right.

121
00:08:38,664 --> 00:08:41,534
I-I guess I do want
to be remembered.

122
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,704
So, what are you doing
to make sure you will be?

123
00:08:47,382 --> 00:08:50,821
Well, I'm thinking of going to
the Pennington School on Earth.

124
00:08:50,855 --> 00:08:54,294
You already have the talent
inside you.

125
00:08:54,329 --> 00:08:56,265
I can see it.

126
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,532
You just need someone

127
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:02,409
to help you bring it
to the surface.

128
00:09:02,446 --> 00:09:04,177
How?

129
00:09:04,216 --> 00:09:06,083
There are ways.

130
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,317
Exercises.

131
00:09:08,357 --> 00:09:10,827
Techniques.

132
00:09:10,862 --> 00:09:13,527
Can you show them to me?

133
00:09:13,568 --> 00:09:17,269
Come to my quarters tonight.

134
00:09:21,015 --> 00:09:22,609
I'll be there.

135
00:09:43,227 --> 00:09:44,890
Are you packed?

136
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,832
Kasidy's ship is going
to be here any minute.

137
00:09:46,867 --> 00:09:49,030
Dad, I-I was thinking
about staying home.

138
00:09:49,071 --> 00:09:50,505
Staying home?
This trip was your idea.

139
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:51,635
I know.

140
00:09:51,677 --> 00:09:53,704
You mean, you really
want to pass up

141
00:09:53,748 --> 00:09:56,515
three days
in the Bajoran outback?

142
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,183
I thought maybe you and Kasidy

143
00:09:58,224 --> 00:10:00,194
would have a better time
without me.

144
00:10:00,228 --> 00:10:03,530
Oh, lay off
the matchmaking, Jake.

145
00:10:03,568 --> 00:10:05,629
Kasidy and I are doing fine.

146
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:07,505
It's not just that.

147
00:10:07,542 --> 00:10:10,241
I'm also working on this story

148
00:10:10,281 --> 00:10:12,274
and I don't want to lose
my concentration.

149
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:14,186
You can write on the trip.

150
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,986
Look, I'm not trying
to talk you into anything.

151
00:10:18,063 --> 00:10:20,556
I don't get leave often,
and I was looking forward

152
00:10:20,602 --> 00:10:22,799
to the three of us
spending time together.

153
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:27,007
Me, too, but...
I really need to focus on this.

154
00:10:27,047 --> 00:10:28,538
All right.

155
00:10:28,584 --> 00:10:30,075
Good luck with it.

156
00:10:34,196 --> 00:10:35,756
See you in a couple of days.

157
00:10:41,984 --> 00:10:44,284
My marriage was a sham.

158
00:10:44,323 --> 00:10:47,420
What I'd mistaken for love...

159
00:10:47,462 --> 00:10:50,366
was nothing more than a prison.

160
00:10:50,402 --> 00:10:52,736
So... tell me.

161
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:54,900
Where are you girls headed?

162
00:10:54,943 --> 00:10:56,640
Oh.

163
00:10:56,681 --> 00:10:58,207
A holosuite.

164
00:10:58,251 --> 00:11:01,348
King Arthur's court.

165
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,656
Camelot.

166
00:11:03,695 --> 00:11:06,131
Love betrayed...

167
00:11:07,869 --> 00:11:09,600
Dreams...

168
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,303
shattered.

169
00:11:11,343 --> 00:11:12,641
Look at them.

170
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:14,410
You'd think somebody died.

171
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:17,547
I don't know if it's because
she's Betazoid or what

172
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:19,218
but her mood is contagious.

173
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:22,926
As soon as she walked in here,
things started getting quiet.

174
00:11:22,966 --> 00:11:25,459
Well, what do you
want me to do about it?

175
00:11:25,505 --> 00:11:27,998
Either cheer her up
or get her to leave

176
00:11:28,043 --> 00:11:31,243
because if you don't,
I'm going to throw her out.

177
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:40,229
Odo.

178
00:11:40,268 --> 00:11:42,568
Won't you join the party?

179
00:11:42,606 --> 00:11:45,669
Actually, I have some free time

180
00:11:45,712 --> 00:11:50,552
and I was wondering
if you wanted to take a walk.

181
00:11:50,588 --> 00:11:52,056
I would.

182
00:11:52,091 --> 00:11:54,425
I meant Lwaxana.

183
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:57,458
I would love to.

184
00:11:57,502 --> 00:11:58,527
Sorry.

185
00:11:58,571 --> 00:12:00,131
Maybe next time.

186
00:12:03,981 --> 00:12:07,147
I'm so depressed.

187
00:12:07,188 --> 00:12:12,153
Kestra was six years old
when she died.

188
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,931
My sweet little girl.

189
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:19,969
I lost my parents,
a sister, a husband.

190
00:12:20,013 --> 00:12:21,573
But nothing...

191
00:12:21,617 --> 00:12:23,917
nothing compared to losing her.

192
00:12:23,955 --> 00:12:25,925
Uh...

193
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:28,931
I didn't mean
to carry on like that.

194
00:12:28,965 --> 00:12:30,263
I'm sorry.

195
00:12:30,301 --> 00:12:32,271
No, don't apologize.

196
00:12:32,305 --> 00:12:35,972
I think I finally understand
why you're so determined

197
00:12:36,012 --> 00:12:39,382
not to let your husband
take the baby from you.

198
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:42,152
These are your quarters,
aren't they?

199
00:12:42,191 --> 00:12:43,717
Yes.

200
00:12:43,761 --> 00:12:45,822
Right next to yours.

201
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,835
My replicator is acting up.

202
00:12:47,869 --> 00:12:50,670
Would you mind terribly if,
if we popped in

203
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:53,407
so I could get a cup
of Gavaline tea?

204
00:12:55,418 --> 00:12:57,047
Of course not.

205
00:13:03,634 --> 00:13:06,970
Uh, the replicator
is right over here.

206
00:13:07,007 --> 00:13:09,638
I'll let Chief O'Brien
know about yours.

207
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,807
Oh, I already did.

208
00:13:10,848 --> 00:13:13,615
He said he'd get to it
as soon as he could.

209
00:13:15,157 --> 00:13:16,922
Gavaline tea.

210
00:13:16,961 --> 00:13:19,956
Is, um... is this
for shape-shifting?

211
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,334
Yes.

212
00:13:22,372 --> 00:13:26,142
Actually, most people
think it's a sculpture.

213
00:13:26,179 --> 00:13:28,776
Well, what do most people know?

214
00:13:28,818 --> 00:13:30,150
Thank you.

215
00:13:34,128 --> 00:13:37,589
May I ask you something, Odo?

216
00:13:37,635 --> 00:13:39,126
Are you over her?

217
00:13:39,171 --> 00:13:41,768
Don't worry.

218
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:45,750
I'm not going to throw myself
at you if you say yes.

219
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:53,599
Major Kira
and First Minister Shakaar

220
00:13:53,634 --> 00:13:55,501
are involved now.

221
00:13:55,538 --> 00:13:57,599
How sad.

222
00:13:57,642 --> 00:13:59,669
Not at all.

223
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,514
I'm happy for her.

224
00:14:04,021 --> 00:14:06,549
Well, just don't
go do what I did...

225
00:14:06,593 --> 00:14:09,622
look for someone
to fix your broken heart

226
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:12,229
then end up pregnant
and on the run.

227
00:14:12,271 --> 00:14:13,865
Ah...

228
00:14:13,941 --> 00:14:18,041
I don't think there's
much danger of that happening.

229
00:14:22,124 --> 00:14:23,422
What is it?

230
00:14:23,461 --> 00:14:25,431
The baby kicked.

231
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:28,198
May I sit down for a minute?

232
00:14:28,236 --> 00:14:30,799
I, I... I don't
have any furniture.

233
00:14:30,842 --> 00:14:33,074
The floor will do.

234
00:14:33,113 --> 00:14:34,707
Oh.

235
00:14:45,103 --> 00:14:48,075
Uh, how are you feeling now?

236
00:14:48,109 --> 00:14:49,577
Like a changeling

237
00:14:49,613 --> 00:14:52,346
who's had to hold
his shape too long.

238
00:14:52,384 --> 00:14:53,545
Ah.

239
00:14:53,587 --> 00:14:55,557
Well, I, uh...

240
00:14:55,591 --> 00:14:58,324
I think I know how that feels.

241
00:14:58,363 --> 00:15:00,492
Oh...

242
00:15:00,535 --> 00:15:02,698
he's moving.

243
00:15:02,739 --> 00:15:06,509
Here. You want to feel?

244
00:15:06,547 --> 00:15:08,176
There.

245
00:15:11,155 --> 00:15:13,318
Yes.

246
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:15,556
Oh.

247
00:15:15,598 --> 00:15:17,568
Oh, I'm so tired, Odo.

248
00:15:17,602 --> 00:15:21,565
I don't think I've had
a decent night's sleep

249
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,204
in weeks.

250
00:15:25,751 --> 00:15:28,746
Sometimes, with Betazoid babies

251
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:32,731
you can actually
sense their thoughts.

252
00:15:35,136 --> 00:15:37,629
Oh, such contentment.

253
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:42,974
Yes...

254
00:15:43,052 --> 00:15:45,045
I can feel it, too.

255
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,292
You know, someone once said

256
00:15:49,331 --> 00:15:54,000
"Life is a search to find
the peace you once had

257
00:15:54,074 --> 00:15:56,374
when you were safe
inside your mother."

258
00:15:58,851 --> 00:16:01,584
I didn't have a mother.

259
00:16:01,623 --> 00:16:03,593
Oh...

260
00:16:03,627 --> 00:16:05,597
don't worry, it's all right.

261
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,264
You'll find your peace...

262
00:16:09,305 --> 00:16:11,298
just the same.

263
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,483
Lwaxana?

264
00:16:18,524 --> 00:16:19,753
Hmm?

265
00:16:19,793 --> 00:16:23,790
Your replicator isn't
really broken, is it?

266
00:16:23,834 --> 00:16:25,497
No.

267
00:16:27,975 --> 00:16:31,813
I'm sorry
if I made you feel unwelcome.

268
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,148
It's...

269
00:16:33,186 --> 00:16:35,817
it's just my way...

270
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,433
Lwaxana?

271
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,764
Yes?

272
00:17:13,801 --> 00:17:15,737
It's Jake... Jake Sisko.

273
00:17:15,771 --> 00:17:17,365
Remember me?

274
00:17:19,411 --> 00:17:20,743
Come in.

275
00:17:23,854 --> 00:17:25,483
I, uh...

276
00:17:25,523 --> 00:17:28,495
I brought some of my stories
for you to read.

277
00:17:28,529 --> 00:17:30,499
I don't need to.

278
00:17:30,533 --> 00:17:31,728
Oh.

279
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:33,501
I thought maybe...

280
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:36,773
It's what you're going
to be writing next

281
00:17:36,813 --> 00:17:38,304
that interests me.

282
00:17:40,621 --> 00:17:42,750
You seem nervous, Jake.

283
00:17:42,792 --> 00:17:45,491
Maybe a little.

284
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,830
That's understandable.

285
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:52,037
You should be nervous
when you start something new.

286
00:17:52,077 --> 00:17:54,605
Although maybe
not this nervous.

287
00:17:54,649 --> 00:17:59,113
Haven't you ever been alone
in a woman's quarters before?

288
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:03,325
Whatever you're thinking,
put it out of your mind.

289
00:18:03,366 --> 00:18:05,063
You're here to work.

290
00:18:05,103 --> 00:18:07,335
Now...

291
00:18:07,374 --> 00:18:13,615
what's the most ambitious story
you ever wanted to tell?

292
00:18:13,654 --> 00:18:15,954
I have an idea for a novel.

293
00:18:15,991 --> 00:18:18,588
It's sort of autobiographical.

294
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,727
The main character's mother
dies.

295
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,763
It's not about that, really.

296
00:18:23,807 --> 00:18:26,073
It's about a lot of things.

297
00:18:26,111 --> 00:18:29,606
So many, it all seems
so big to you right now.

298
00:18:29,652 --> 00:18:32,954
You're afraid
that you can't do it justice.

299
00:18:32,992 --> 00:18:34,928
Yeah.

300
00:18:34,963 --> 00:18:39,996
But I'll bet you know
what the first line is.

301
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:42,532
How'd you know that?

302
00:18:42,577 --> 00:18:45,743
I have something
I want to show you.

303
00:18:48,255 --> 00:18:50,935
Revalus used it
when he wrote <i>The Wait.</i>

304
00:18:51,068 --> 00:18:52,229
You knew him?

305
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,706
I have a weakness for artists.

306
00:18:54,743 --> 00:18:56,075
I told you that.

307
00:18:58,082 --> 00:19:01,350
I want you to have it.

308
00:19:03,927 --> 00:19:05,088
I don't know what to say.

309
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,098
Thank you.

310
00:19:06,132 --> 00:19:07,897
There's more.

311
00:19:10,073 --> 00:19:13,045
Here...

312
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:14,912
Paper?

313
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,652
I've never worked
on paper before.

314
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,058
Revalus used to say

315
00:19:21,095 --> 00:19:23,794
that "a writer should
put pen to paper

316
00:19:23,834 --> 00:19:27,329
as if he were a painter
putting brush to canvas."

317
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:30,905
It's a part of what
he called "visceral writing."

318
00:19:30,948 --> 00:19:32,246
What's that?

319
00:19:32,284 --> 00:19:35,085
It's one of the techniques
I told you about.

320
00:19:35,123 --> 00:19:37,788
Can you teach it to me?

321
00:19:37,829 --> 00:19:40,494
That's why you're here.

322
00:19:42,504 --> 00:19:44,030
Isn't it?

323
00:19:46,045 --> 00:19:48,413
The opening line
of your novel...

324
00:19:48,449 --> 00:19:50,078
write it down.

325
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,646
Now, keep going.

326
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,342
What do you mean, "keep going"?

327
00:20:05,383 --> 00:20:07,615
Write whatever comes to you.

328
00:20:07,654 --> 00:20:10,820
The idea is to create
a stream of consciousness

329
00:20:10,861 --> 00:20:12,694
and see where that takes you.

330
00:20:12,732 --> 00:20:14,463
You can edit later.

331
00:20:14,501 --> 00:20:19,205
Just write the first thing
that comes to mind.

332
00:20:19,244 --> 00:20:21,271
I won't look.

333
00:20:21,315 --> 00:20:24,515
Let the words tumble out of you.

334
00:20:24,554 --> 00:20:26,683
Don't censor them.

335
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,788
Feel the pen...

336
00:20:29,832 --> 00:20:31,461
in your hand...

337
00:20:31,502 --> 00:20:33,768
the texture of the paper.

338
00:20:33,807 --> 00:20:37,440
Let yourself fall into a rhythm.

339
00:20:39,718 --> 00:20:41,881
You feel where my thumbs are?

340
00:20:41,923 --> 00:20:42,891
Mm-hmm.

341
00:20:42,925 --> 00:20:44,792
That's your foramen magnum.

342
00:20:45,831 --> 00:20:47,357
It's a focal point

343
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,167
for the body's
bioelectric field.

344
00:20:51,308 --> 00:20:53,608
There's another one...

345
00:20:53,713 --> 00:20:55,342
here.

346
00:20:55,383 --> 00:20:59,551
The Vulcans call them <i>qui'lari.</i>

347
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:05,000
The Indians of ancient Earth
called them <i>shakras.</i>

348
00:21:05,036 --> 00:21:10,981
I know how to stimulate them
to make you feel restful...

349
00:21:12,017 --> 00:21:14,010
or energized...

350
00:21:14,054 --> 00:21:15,249
or even...

351
00:21:16,993 --> 00:21:18,553
creative.

352
00:21:22,103 --> 00:21:24,232
This isn't bad.

353
00:21:24,274 --> 00:21:28,841
I told you I could help you.

354
00:21:30,854 --> 00:21:33,222
Let the words...

355
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:35,388
flow, Jake.

356
00:21:43,379 --> 00:21:45,815
Let them flow.

357
00:21:56,505 --> 00:21:58,498
Yes...

358
00:22:01,215 --> 00:22:03,014
that's it.

359
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:08,184
Let them flow.

360
00:22:42,463 --> 00:22:44,433
There you are.

361
00:22:50,881 --> 00:22:53,147
Got you that time.

362
00:22:55,223 --> 00:22:56,920
That's not fair.

363
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,725
I didn't know
you could do surfaces.

364
00:22:58,762 --> 00:23:00,857
Well, now you do.

365
00:23:00,901 --> 00:23:02,335
Shall we try again?

366
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:03,999
Are you sure you're up to it?

367
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,805
Oh, absolutely.

368
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:09,647
I haven't had so much fun
in months.

369
00:23:09,684 --> 00:23:10,777
Really?

370
00:23:12,857 --> 00:23:14,120
Neither have I.

371
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,526
Security to Odo.

372
00:23:15,563 --> 00:23:16,997
Go ahead.

373
00:23:17,033 --> 00:23:19,367
A transport just arrived
from the Umani sector.

374
00:23:19,404 --> 00:23:22,001
The man you asked us
to look out for was on it.

375
00:23:22,043 --> 00:23:23,511
Acknowledged.

376
00:23:23,545 --> 00:23:24,672
You know what to do.

377
00:23:24,714 --> 00:23:25,682
Aye, sir.

378
00:23:25,716 --> 00:23:27,184
It's my husband, isn't it?

379
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,188
Stay here.

380
00:23:28,222 --> 00:23:30,215
I'll handle this.

381
00:23:36,571 --> 00:23:40,032
You'd better have a good reason
for dragging me in like this.

382
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:42,242
I'm Chief of Station Security.

383
00:23:42,283 --> 00:23:44,549
That's all the reason I need.

384
00:23:44,587 --> 00:23:47,218
Well, well.

385
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,889
You're the changeling.

386
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:51,196
Odo... if I remember correctly.

387
00:23:51,234 --> 00:23:52,259
And what of it?

388
00:23:52,303 --> 00:23:54,330
Lwaxana told me all about you.

389
00:23:54,374 --> 00:23:57,175
How you broke her heart.

390
00:23:57,213 --> 00:24:00,208
Strange she'd come running
to you for protection.

391
00:24:00,252 --> 00:24:03,656
Her pregnancy must have her
confused, poor woman.

392
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,594
I find her remarkably
clear-headed.

393
00:24:05,629 --> 00:24:07,155
She doesn't want to see you

394
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,670
so you might as well
turn around and go home.

395
00:24:09,704 --> 00:24:10,933
I've come a long way.

396
00:24:10,974 --> 00:24:13,240
I'm not leaving here
empty-handed.

397
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:15,271
She is not going back with you.

398
00:24:15,316 --> 00:24:17,081
I am not talking about her.

399
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,885
I'm talking about my son.

400
00:24:18,922 --> 00:24:21,758
I intend to see
that he is raised by men...

401
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:24,561
not by the pampering foolishness
of women.

402
00:24:24,601 --> 00:24:26,230
I hate to disappoint you

403
00:24:26,271 --> 00:24:29,368
but Lwaxana has no intention
of giving him up to you.

404
00:24:29,411 --> 00:24:31,643
Her intentions
do not concern me.

405
00:24:31,681 --> 00:24:34,915
As her husband,
I have a legal right to my son.

406
00:24:34,954 --> 00:24:39,395
I've been familiarizing myself
with Tavnian laws.

407
00:24:39,431 --> 00:24:42,232
It's well established
that the male child

408
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:45,572
is considered the property
of the mother's husband.

409
00:24:47,146 --> 00:24:48,672
Exactly.

410
00:24:48,715 --> 00:24:50,981
Not the child's father.

411
00:24:51,021 --> 00:24:52,615
The mother's husband.

412
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,820
By the time Lwaxana gives birth

413
00:24:54,928 --> 00:24:57,764
you won't be her husband.

414
00:24:59,003 --> 00:25:00,403
We're getting married?

415
00:25:00,439 --> 00:25:03,775
If you take me as your husband
in a legal Tavnian ceremony

416
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:06,874
your marriage to Jeyal
will automatically be annulled

417
00:25:06,918 --> 00:25:09,411
and he'll lose his claim
to the baby.

418
00:25:09,457 --> 00:25:13,022
I-I... I don't quite
know what to say.

419
00:25:13,065 --> 00:25:15,433
I'm... well, I'm just touched

420
00:25:15,469 --> 00:25:17,905
by your willingness
to do this for me.

421
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,637
Well, it's not so much, really.

422
00:25:19,677 --> 00:25:22,170
We'll remain husband and wife
for a few months

423
00:25:22,216 --> 00:25:24,049
long enough to satisfy
Tavnian law

424
00:25:24,087 --> 00:25:27,389
and then get an annulment
of our own.

425
00:25:27,426 --> 00:25:32,334
It's not as if I was planning
to marry someone else.

426
00:25:33,505 --> 00:25:37,639
Even so... thank you.

427
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,982
There is one thing
I don't understand.

428
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:45,085
Jeyal insisted on staying
to witness the ceremony.

429
00:25:45,129 --> 00:25:47,122
He did?

430
00:25:48,669 --> 00:25:51,664
Is that a problem?

431
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:54,703
In a, uh, Tavnian wedding

432
00:25:54,747 --> 00:25:57,617
the groom must stand
before the bride

433
00:25:57,653 --> 00:26:00,591
and tell her why he wants
to marry her.

434
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:03,826
And then, in front
of his family and friends

435
00:26:03,865 --> 00:26:06,735
he must proclaim
his love for her

436
00:26:06,771 --> 00:26:11,440
and convince her
to accept him as her husband.

437
00:26:11,481 --> 00:26:14,578
Well, I trust I can count on you
to accept me

438
00:26:14,621 --> 00:26:17,320
even if I just stand there
and read last week's

439
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,760
criminal activity report.

440
00:26:18,795 --> 00:26:23,168
Um... no, no, no, you don't
quite understand.

441
00:26:23,205 --> 00:26:27,874
If anyone present
doubts the groom's sincerity

442
00:26:27,913 --> 00:26:31,374
they can challenge the validity
of the marriage.

443
00:26:36,063 --> 00:26:41,701
You mean... I have to convince
Jeyal that I want to marry you?

444
00:26:53,982 --> 00:26:56,579
I've never been able
to write like this.

445
00:26:56,688 --> 00:26:58,487
Ideas are coming so fast.

446
00:26:58,525 --> 00:27:00,324
I can barely keep up with them.

447
00:27:00,362 --> 00:27:02,355
It's amazing, isn't it?

448
00:27:14,724 --> 00:27:17,024
Jake...

449
00:27:17,061 --> 00:27:18,188
It's okay.

450
00:27:18,231 --> 00:27:20,030
It's just a nosebleed.

451
00:27:20,067 --> 00:27:22,537
You should rest.

452
00:27:22,573 --> 00:27:24,509
I'll be all right.

453
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:27,379
It's already stopped.

454
00:27:27,416 --> 00:27:29,409
Where was I?

455
00:27:41,143 --> 00:27:42,338
Did I miss something?

456
00:27:42,379 --> 00:27:44,440
I didn't know Odo was getting
married till this morning.

457
00:27:44,483 --> 00:27:46,612
I'm not sure he knew either.

458
00:27:46,654 --> 00:27:48,317
Who's he?

459
00:27:48,358 --> 00:27:52,321
I think that's
Lwaxana's husband.

460
00:27:53,668 --> 00:27:55,763
Good of him to come.

461
00:28:03,254 --> 00:28:04,586
Well...

462
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:06,819
I'm so glad you could make it.

463
00:28:06,861 --> 00:28:08,295
I'm sure you are.

464
00:28:08,331 --> 00:28:11,462
It's not too late
to call this off.

465
00:28:11,504 --> 00:28:13,531
Your dignity's important to you.

466
00:28:13,575 --> 00:28:15,238
I understand that.

467
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:17,544
I would not want
anyone to see me

468
00:28:17,583 --> 00:28:20,555
go through a charade like this.

469
00:28:20,589 --> 00:28:22,889
If you don't mind

470
00:28:22,926 --> 00:28:26,491
this is a very special
moment for me.

471
00:28:53,955 --> 00:28:56,688
In keeping
with Tavnian tradition

472
00:28:56,727 --> 00:28:59,927
I stand before you
here in my home

473
00:28:59,967 --> 00:29:02,369
among my worldly possessions

474
00:29:02,406 --> 00:29:05,845
and declare my wish
to add this woman

475
00:29:05,879 --> 00:29:07,781
to that which is mine.

476
00:29:07,816 --> 00:29:10,116
She is as kind
as she is beautiful

477
00:29:10,154 --> 00:29:12,955
and I want her to be

478
00:29:12,993 --> 00:29:16,227
part of my life
from this day on.

479
00:29:16,267 --> 00:29:17,462
Marry me, Lwaxana.

480
00:29:17,503 --> 00:29:19,200
Am I the only one

481
00:29:19,239 --> 00:29:22,143
who finds this a pale
declaration of love?

482
00:29:22,178 --> 00:29:24,614
You could be talking
about any woman!

483
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:27,315
Lwaxana is not just any woman!

484
00:29:27,356 --> 00:29:29,292
Not to me.

485
00:29:29,326 --> 00:29:32,594
Then prove it to us.

486
00:29:48,431 --> 00:29:51,369
Before I met her...

487
00:29:51,404 --> 00:29:52,930
my world was...

488
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:57,212
a much smaller place.

489
00:29:57,248 --> 00:29:58,716
I kept to myself.

490
00:29:58,751 --> 00:30:00,584
I didn't need anyone else

491
00:30:00,622 --> 00:30:02,592
and I took pride in that.

492
00:30:02,626 --> 00:30:04,289
The truth is...

493
00:30:05,999 --> 00:30:08,469
I was ashamed of what I was.

494
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:14,778
Afraid that if people saw
how truly different I was

495
00:30:14,883 --> 00:30:16,978
they would recoil from me.

496
00:30:17,021 --> 00:30:21,519
Lwaxana saw
how different I was...

497
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,526
and she didn't recoil.

498
00:30:26,507 --> 00:30:28,807
She wanted to see more.

499
00:30:31,216 --> 00:30:33,618
For the first time in my life...

500
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:37,558
someone wanted me as I was.

501
00:30:38,831 --> 00:30:41,598
And that changed me...

502
00:30:41,637 --> 00:30:43,037
forever.

503
00:30:45,845 --> 00:30:47,815
The day I met her

504
00:30:47,849 --> 00:30:52,085
is the day I stopped
being alone.

505
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:01,606
And I want her
to be part of my life

506
00:31:01,644 --> 00:31:03,773
from this day on.

507
00:31:05,985 --> 00:31:08,217
Marry me, Lwaxana.

508
00:31:08,256 --> 00:31:11,524
Let me into your light.

509
00:31:13,801 --> 00:31:15,668
Lwaxana?

510
00:31:16,974 --> 00:31:19,410
I give myself to you...

511
00:31:21,484 --> 00:31:24,354
forever and always.

512
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:28,455
I say for all to hear
that this woman is mine.

513
00:31:28,498 --> 00:31:31,095
If anyone challenges
my claim to her

514
00:31:31,136 --> 00:31:34,370
let them do so now.

515
00:31:42,492 --> 00:31:44,985
I present to you...

516
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:47,466
my beloved wife.

517
00:31:54,817 --> 00:31:56,308
- Odo.
- Chief.

518
00:31:56,352 --> 00:31:58,949
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

519
00:32:02,231 --> 00:32:03,860
Congratulations.

520
00:32:03,901 --> 00:32:05,666
Well done.

521
00:32:09,746 --> 00:32:10,975
I...

522
00:32:11,015 --> 00:32:13,178
cherished you, Lwaxana.

523
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:17,126
You were my most
treasured possession.

524
00:32:18,598 --> 00:32:20,625
Take care of our son.

525
00:32:20,668 --> 00:32:23,469
When he asks...

526
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:25,341
speak well of me.

527
00:32:37,301 --> 00:32:39,703
Ladies and gentlemen,
please do me the honor

528
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,767
of accompanying me
to my humble establishment.

529
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:43,871
I'm throwing a party
for the happy couple.

530
00:32:43,915 --> 00:32:44,905
Quark?

531
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:45,918
What can I say?

532
00:32:45,952 --> 00:32:47,079
I'm a hopeless romantic.

533
00:32:54,001 --> 00:32:55,367
Are you all right?

534
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,609
We did it.

535
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:00,944
He's really leaving.

536
00:33:00,982 --> 00:33:02,576
It would appear so.

537
00:33:02,619 --> 00:33:05,921
Oh, Odo, you were wonderful.

538
00:33:05,992 --> 00:33:07,757
You know, for a minute there

539
00:33:07,796 --> 00:33:10,359
I really believed you
wanted to marry me.

540
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,429
I suppose that we should
tell them the truth...

541
00:33:13,473 --> 00:33:16,172
but let's wait
till after the party.

542
00:33:19,853 --> 00:33:23,816
Jake, you should rest.

543
00:33:23,861 --> 00:33:25,660
Not now.

544
00:33:25,698 --> 00:33:27,258
I'm on to something.

545
00:33:27,301 --> 00:33:30,296
Your father will be home soon.

546
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,469
You should be there.

547
00:33:32,512 --> 00:33:34,482
I'll see him later.

548
00:33:36,654 --> 00:33:37,952
Enough.

549
00:33:37,989 --> 00:33:40,688
What'd you do that for?

550
00:33:40,728 --> 00:33:42,994
You're pushing yourself
too hard.

551
00:33:43,066 --> 00:33:44,261
No, I'm not.

552
00:33:44,301 --> 00:33:45,998
My mind has never been so clear.

553
00:33:46,072 --> 00:33:47,735
Everything is coming together.

554
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,680
At this rate, I can finish
this novel in a few days.

555
00:33:50,715 --> 00:33:52,241
And you will.

556
00:33:52,284 --> 00:33:53,547
I promise you.

557
00:33:53,587 --> 00:33:57,550
But if you rest now,
your work will be even better.

558
00:33:59,498 --> 00:34:00,591
All right.

559
00:34:00,635 --> 00:34:02,764
I'll go home.

560
00:34:02,806 --> 00:34:05,140
Maybe get some sleep.

561
00:34:05,177 --> 00:34:07,910
You'll come back later?

562
00:34:07,949 --> 00:34:09,976
Of course.

563
00:34:10,087 --> 00:34:12,023
I need you.

564
00:34:30,393 --> 00:34:31,884
Promenade.

565
00:34:52,939 --> 00:34:54,738
Orange juice.

566
00:35:08,269 --> 00:35:09,966
Something has stimulated

567
00:35:10,006 --> 00:35:13,240
Jake's brain functioning in
a way that I have never seen.

568
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:16,342
The capillaries in his cerebral
cortex have dilated 20 percent.

569
00:35:16,385 --> 00:35:19,516
Neurotransmitter production
is up by at least that amount

570
00:35:19,558 --> 00:35:21,619
and neural activity
is off the scale.

571
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:23,530
Do you have any idea
what caused it?

572
00:35:23,566 --> 00:35:25,968
Not yet, but it's a good thing
we got him here when we did.

573
00:35:26,005 --> 00:35:28,533
His cortex was on the verge
of synaptic collapse.

574
00:35:28,576 --> 00:35:30,375
But he is going to be all right.

575
00:35:30,413 --> 00:35:30,905
Mm-hmm.

576
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:32,268
I'd like to keep him

577
00:35:32,308 --> 00:35:35,144
in the neural stabilization
field for a while.

578
00:35:35,181 --> 00:35:37,242
Onaya.

579
00:35:37,285 --> 00:35:39,221
Jake.

580
00:35:39,255 --> 00:35:41,384
Where is she?

581
00:35:41,493 --> 00:35:44,021
Jake, what happened?

582
00:35:45,501 --> 00:35:48,064
I'm going to talk to Odo

583
00:35:48,107 --> 00:35:51,602
see if he knows anything
about this Onaya.

584
00:35:51,646 --> 00:35:54,082
I'll let you know
if his condition changes.

585
00:35:57,625 --> 00:35:59,618
I'll be in the lab.

586
00:36:31,626 --> 00:36:33,858
Come with me, Jake.

587
00:36:33,898 --> 00:36:36,927
It's time to finish...

588
00:36:36,971 --> 00:36:39,373
what we started.

589
00:36:45,588 --> 00:36:47,581
I'm picking up
concentrated traces

590
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:50,118
of some sort of psionic energy
in the bulkhead.

591
00:36:50,164 --> 00:36:52,464
The tests I ran indicated
that Jake's mental activity

592
00:36:52,568 --> 00:36:55,335
was stimulated by some kind
of psionic phenomenon

593
00:36:55,374 --> 00:36:57,867
possibly telepathic in nature.

594
00:36:57,913 --> 00:37:00,145
Then this entity
Nurse Tagana saw

595
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:01,652
could have been responsible.

596
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:03,417
We have to find it,
then get Jake back

597
00:37:03,457 --> 00:37:05,620
in the neural stabilization
field before it's too late.

598
00:37:05,661 --> 00:37:07,563
I'll tell Odo to have
his search parties

599
00:37:07,598 --> 00:37:10,297
reconfigure their tricorders
to scan for psionic energy.

600
00:37:10,337 --> 00:37:11,863
That'll help,
but only for a while.

601
00:37:11,908 --> 00:37:13,434
Psionic residue
decays within minutes.

602
00:37:13,477 --> 00:37:14,911
Then we'd better get moving.

603
00:37:20,491 --> 00:37:22,120
Keep going, Jake.

604
00:37:26,636 --> 00:37:29,699
The moment...

605
00:37:29,742 --> 00:37:31,336
I saw you...

606
00:37:31,379 --> 00:37:33,315
I knew you were worthy

607
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:35,616
of what I could give you.

608
00:37:35,654 --> 00:37:39,058
But I can't stay
with you forever.

609
00:37:39,095 --> 00:37:41,931
This is your chance...

610
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,665
to create something

611
00:37:43,704 --> 00:37:48,772
that will live on
long after you're gone.

612
00:37:55,795 --> 00:37:57,195
There...

613
00:37:57,231 --> 00:37:59,463
it'll stop in a minute.

614
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:08,616
I'm getting something...

615
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:11,181
about 20 meters
in this direction.

616
00:38:11,226 --> 00:38:12,626
I'll go this way.

617
00:38:12,661 --> 00:38:15,029
You swing around
and take Tunnel 61-G.

618
00:38:25,521 --> 00:38:27,115
What's wrong?

619
00:38:28,693 --> 00:38:30,025
I-I can't...

620
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:32,667
Let me help you.

621
00:38:38,313 --> 00:38:40,806
That's better, isn't it?

622
00:38:51,573 --> 00:38:52,734
Get away from him!

623
00:38:54,045 --> 00:38:55,947
Dad, don't... don't interfere.

624
00:38:55,982 --> 00:38:57,781
I said get away!

625
00:39:05,033 --> 00:39:06,023
Sisko to Ops.

626
00:39:06,069 --> 00:39:07,128
Go ahead.

627
00:39:07,171 --> 00:39:08,662
Lock on to my signal

628
00:39:08,707 --> 00:39:11,338
and stand by to beam Jake
directly to the Infirmary.

629
00:39:11,379 --> 00:39:13,679
You're too close
to the reactor core.

630
00:39:13,717 --> 00:39:16,153
There's so much interference,
I can't get a lock.

631
00:39:16,189 --> 00:39:18,216
Get a medical team
down here immediately.

632
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,228
Aye, sir.

633
00:39:19,262 --> 00:39:20,993
What are you?

634
00:39:21,032 --> 00:39:23,264
It's not what I am that matters.

635
00:39:23,303 --> 00:39:24,532
It's what I do.

636
00:39:24,572 --> 00:39:27,042
You don't know
the minds I've touched...

637
00:39:27,077 --> 00:39:29,377
Catullus, Tarbolde, Keats...

638
00:39:29,415 --> 00:39:31,044
a hundred others.

639
00:39:31,085 --> 00:39:33,248
I unlocked their potential.

640
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:34,953
Is that what you did to Jake?

641
00:39:34,993 --> 00:39:35,961
Look at him!

642
00:39:35,995 --> 00:39:37,965
They all die in the end

643
00:39:37,999 --> 00:39:41,403
but look what I gave them
in return... immortality.

644
00:39:41,439 --> 00:39:43,773
Their names
will live on forever.

645
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:46,212
And you...
what do you get out of it?

646
00:39:46,249 --> 00:39:50,587
What I need to survive,
so I can go on, find others

647
00:39:50,624 --> 00:39:53,926
and unlock their talents
as well.

648
00:39:53,965 --> 00:39:56,835
He was the youngest
I ever found.

649
00:39:56,869 --> 00:39:58,235
So eager...

650
00:39:58,273 --> 00:40:03,545
ready to give everything
he had in one great burst.

651
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:05,644
What a waste.

652
00:40:07,157 --> 00:40:10,688
I will never forget you, Jake.

653
00:40:11,699 --> 00:40:14,569
You're not going anywhere.

654
00:40:31,739 --> 00:40:33,971
I have wonderful news.

655
00:40:34,011 --> 00:40:36,676
There's a transport for Betazed
leaving this afternoon.

656
00:40:36,716 --> 00:40:39,016
I'm going home.

657
00:40:39,055 --> 00:40:41,959
I thought you were planning
on having the baby here.

658
00:40:41,994 --> 00:40:44,659
If I did, I'd end up
staying for months

659
00:40:44,699 --> 00:40:46,065
and that wouldn't be fair.

660
00:40:46,102 --> 00:40:48,630
I've imposed on you enough.

661
00:40:50,444 --> 00:40:52,880
Lwaxana...

662
00:40:52,915 --> 00:40:55,648
you could deliver
at any time now

663
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:58,386
and it's a long way to Betazed.

664
00:40:58,426 --> 00:41:00,555
You really should stay.

665
00:41:02,701 --> 00:41:04,534
I'll miss you, too.

666
00:41:04,572 --> 00:41:07,237
Then why leave?

667
00:41:09,382 --> 00:41:11,875
You've gotten used
to having me around

668
00:41:11,919 --> 00:41:12,909
haven't you?

669
00:41:16,729 --> 00:41:19,360
Oh, you dear, sweet man.

670
00:41:19,402 --> 00:41:20,962
Don't you see?

671
00:41:21,005 --> 00:41:24,740
What you want is company,
someone to take care of.

672
00:41:26,416 --> 00:41:28,682
Is that so wrong?

673
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,383
No, of course not.

674
00:41:30,424 --> 00:41:34,694
The problem is, I want much
more than that from you.

675
00:41:34,732 --> 00:41:36,895
You see, I can't help it.

676
00:41:36,936 --> 00:41:39,567
I'm still in love with you.

677
00:41:39,608 --> 00:41:42,910
And as much as I wish that
you were in love with me

678
00:41:42,948 --> 00:41:44,679
I know you're not.

679
00:41:47,958 --> 00:41:49,187
I could stay.

680
00:41:49,228 --> 00:41:51,927
I could try to make you
fall in love with me

681
00:41:51,966 --> 00:41:56,031
but we both know
that won't happen.

682
00:41:56,075 --> 00:41:58,307
Then I'd end up resenting you

683
00:41:58,346 --> 00:42:01,216
and our friendship
is far too important

684
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:03,222
for me to let that happen.

685
00:42:03,256 --> 00:42:06,285
That's why it's better
for both of us

686
00:42:06,329 --> 00:42:07,558
if I leave now.

687
00:42:20,123 --> 00:42:22,320
Good-bye, husband.

688
00:42:22,361 --> 00:42:25,197
Good-bye...

689
00:42:25,233 --> 00:42:26,724
wife.

690
00:42:41,699 --> 00:42:42,860
How are you feeling?

691
00:42:45,173 --> 00:42:46,733
Okay, I guess.

692
00:42:46,776 --> 00:42:48,678
You've read it?

693
00:42:48,713 --> 00:42:50,740
I just finished.

694
00:42:50,784 --> 00:42:52,845
What do you think?

695
00:42:52,888 --> 00:42:55,724
You've got a good start
on a novel here, Jake.

696
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,221
The dialogue is sharp,
the story's involving

697
00:42:59,268 --> 00:43:01,170
the characters are real.

698
00:43:01,205 --> 00:43:03,471
The spelling is terrible.

699
00:43:04,511 --> 00:43:06,413
I especially like the father.

700
00:43:06,449 --> 00:43:08,214
Remind you of anyone?

701
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,915
A bit.

702
00:43:09,955 --> 00:43:11,822
It's really good.

703
00:43:12,861 --> 00:43:14,227
I know.

704
00:43:14,264 --> 00:43:15,357
I just wish I wrote it.

705
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,766
You did.

706
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:18,362
How can I be sure?

707
00:43:18,406 --> 00:43:19,601
I mean, without Onaya...

708
00:43:19,642 --> 00:43:20,610
Listen to me.

709
00:43:20,644 --> 00:43:22,546
You wrote these words, not her.

710
00:43:22,581 --> 00:43:25,109
But she got them
out of me.

711
00:43:25,153 --> 00:43:28,557
Which means they were somewhere
inside of you.

712
00:43:29,895 --> 00:43:31,158
And all you have to do

713
00:43:31,198 --> 00:43:33,464
is to learn to find
them for yourself.

714
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:37,008
You're right.

715
00:43:37,043 --> 00:43:38,477
But I got to tell you.

716
00:43:38,513 --> 00:43:40,983
I don't feel up to writing
just yet.

717
00:43:41,017 --> 00:43:42,417
That's understandable.

718
00:43:42,454 --> 00:43:44,219
Take it easy for a while.

719
00:43:44,258 --> 00:43:45,852
You'll get back to it.

720
00:43:45,894 --> 00:43:48,525
And then, someday...

721
00:43:48,566 --> 00:43:52,027
when you're ready,
maybe you'll finish it.

722
00:43:52,073 --> 00:43:54,270
Sounds like a plan.

723
00:43:56,348 --> 00:43:58,911
I've got to get to work.

724
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:01,583
I'll check in on you
in a couple of hours.

725
00:44:01,625 --> 00:44:03,288
I'll be here.
