1
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:08,049
(<i> sighs</i> )

2
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:11,386
I never should have let her go,
not in her condition.

3
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:14,849
Chief, I am certain
Dr. Bashir and Major Kira

4
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,266
are taking good care
of your wife.

5
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:18,185
And besides, you
know there's no way

6
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,061
you could have kept
Keiko from going.

7
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:21,438
She's been talking

8
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,524
about the botanical
mysteries on Torad V

9
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,150
for a long time.

10
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,401
You're lucky
she agreed

11
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:27,903
to limit the trip
to three days.

12
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:30,030
Three days
in the Gamma Quadrant.

13
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,115
Do you know what she
wanted to do last week?

14
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:33,241
What?

15
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:34,702
She wanted
to go back to Bajor

16
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:36,871
and rappel down
the cliffs of Undalar

17
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:38,789
to get a fungus sample.

18
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:41,542
Rappel to get fungus!

19
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:44,419
It's as if I have to remind her
that she's pregnant.

20
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:47,882
Yeah. I guess
the extra weight,
the morning sickness

21
00:00:47,882 --> 00:00:49,008
the mood swings

22
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:50,634
the medical
examinations--

23
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:52,678
they aren't reminders enough.

24
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:55,055
I have work to do.

25
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:58,684
Hey!

26
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,144
CROWD:
Dabo!

27
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,855
DABO GIRL:
Very good!
We have a winner!

28
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:05,733
Rom! My brother!

29
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:07,818
I'm glad to see you.

30
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:10,362
Let me pour you
a snail juice.

31
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:12,656
Okay, but only one.

32
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:13,949
My shift starts
in 33 minutes.

33
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,200
I'll make it a tall one

34
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,284
and it's on the house.

35
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,369
We're celebrating.

36
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,371
Celebrating?!

37
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:21,373
What?

38
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:22,750
My return from
two weeks

39
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,709
on Ferenginar.

40
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:24,793
Didn't you miss me?

41
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,253
Uh, I suppose.

42
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,505
And<i> I</i> missed<i> you.</i>

43
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:31,550
That's two reasons
for celebrating.

44
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,260
Enjoy.

45
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,262
Thanks.

46
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,972
Just the way
you like it?

47
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,600
Perfect.

48
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,100
(<i> chuckles</i> )

49
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,228
So, how was your trip?

50
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,438
Did you close
the vole belly deal?

51
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:45,856
The what?

52
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:48,984
Oh, yeah. Closed it
on the first day.

53
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:50,652
15 percent
profit margin.

54
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:51,653
Great.

55
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,447
Did you see Moogie?

56
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:54,489
Mother's fine.

57
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:55,783
She sends her love.

58
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,659
What else did you do?

59
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,871
Well, let's see, uh...

60
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:01,997
I closed the deal--
told you that.

61
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:03,874
Did some shopping...

62
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:06,334
Made a pilgrimage
to the Great Marketplace.

63
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,545
And, uh... oh, yes.

64
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,047
I found out, uh...

65
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,968
I'm...

66
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:15,677
I'm dying!

67
00:02:24,103 --> 00:02:25,854
What are you all
looking at?

68
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,983
Haven't you ever seen
a dying man before?

69
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:31,271
You're dying?

70
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:35,984
I got my results

71
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,237
from my annual
insurance physical.

72
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:41,907
All the tests came back
negative except for one.

73
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:44,451
I have Dorek syndrome.

74
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,745
But... that's incurable.

75
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,329
That's right,

76
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,665
which explains the "dying" part.

77
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,085
But... Dorek syndrome...

78
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:54,211
it's so rare.

79
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:55,670
It strikes

80
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,965
only one out of every
five million Ferengi.

81
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:00,884
I finally beat the odds.

82
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,889
How long do you have before...?

83
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,726
According to Dr. Orpax,
six days...

84
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,019
maybe seven.

85
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,520
Is he sure?

86
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,606
Oh, of course,
he's sure.

87
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,108
He's one of the most
expensive doctors

88
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:17,234
on Ferenginar.

89
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,860
He charges two
slips of latinum

90
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,821
just to walk into
the waiting room.

91
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,906
This is terrible!

92
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:25,117
I don't want you
to die, Brother.

93
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:27,244
Maybe you should get
a second opinion.

94
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:28,578
Have Dr. Bashir examine you
when he gets back

95
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:29,788
from the Gamma Quadrant.

96
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,414
Bashir? How good
could<i> he</i> be?

97
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,500
He doesn't even charge.

98
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,545
Besides, what could
a hu-man doctor know

99
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,589
about Dorek syndrome?

100
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,303
You're going to die!

101
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:46,596
(<i> sobbing</i> )

102
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:50,934
I have six days to take care
of everything-- my will...

103
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:53,187
Moogie's pension.

104
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:55,480
I have to make
funeral arrangements.

105
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,523
Pay off my debts.

106
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,399
That's a lot of debts, Brother.

107
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,569
Yes, but half of those
are to hu-mans, Bajorans

108
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,654
a couple of Klingons.

109
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,281
Rule of Acquisition 17:

110
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,283
A contract is a contract
is a contract--

111
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:07,868
but only between Ferengi.

112
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,495
Exactly. 

113
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,913
But you're right.

114
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:17,878
It's still a lot of debt.

115
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:20,881
You could always sell

116
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,632
the desiccated remains
of your corpse

117
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:23,967
on the Ferengi Futures Exchange.

118
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:27,679
Who'd want to buy a disk
of desiccated Quark?

119
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,556
I'm nobody--

120
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:32,433
just some bartender
with a domineering mother

121
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,810
and an idiot brother.

122
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,603
You were the Grand Nagus.

123
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,105
For a week.

124
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:41,818
If I'm lucky, I'll be a footnote
in some...

125
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,737
Ferengi financial almanac.

126
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,947
You anticipated
the change of administrations

127
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,574
here on the station.

128
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,826
And as a reward

129
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:53,247
I'm inextricably linked
to the Federation.

130
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:58,626
I'm a<i> joke</i> on Ferenginar.

131
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:01,420
Starfleet's favorite bartender!

132
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,215
The synthehol king!

133
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:04,883
What a legacy.

134
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,634
You're not
a joke here.

135
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,929
You're a respected
businessman...

136
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,764
a pillar of the community

137
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,183
a man with... many friends.

138
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,893
Friends?

139
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:17,062
Community?

140
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:20,399
You sound like
some sniveling hu-man.

141
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,319
The only opinions I care about
are those of my peers--

142
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,487
<i>Ferengi</i> businessmen.

143
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,740
In their eyes

144
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,660
I'm a second-rate,
small-time operator.

145
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,126
Stop it!

146
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,128
Stop it, Brother!

147
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:43,004
You<i> are</i> somebody.

148
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,965
You'll see.

149
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,426
You march right over
to that com link

150
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:49,719
and offer your
vacuum-desiccated remains

151
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,930
for sale
on the Futures Exchange.

152
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,140
You'll see.

153
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,891
Bids'll come flooding in

154
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,935
from all over
the Ferengi Alliance.

155
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:59,646
Everyone will want a disk
of Quark on their desk.

156
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,107
In fact, there may
not be enough of you

157
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,442
to meet the demand.

158
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:04,609
(<i> chuckles</i> )

159
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,445
You're a liar,
but I love you.

160
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:08,488
Just wait.

161
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:12,075
When you see how much
your body is worth

162
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:15,329
you're going to wish
you died years ago...

163
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,872
or something like that.

164
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,174
Captain, something's coming
through the wormhole.

165
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,258
On screen.

166
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,430
Magnify.

167
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,351
WORF:
The<i> Volga.</i>

168
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:38,893
It has been damaged.

169
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,854
Dr. Bashir is requesting

170
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,064
emergency transport
to the Infirmary.

171
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,441
Two patients:

172
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,401
Major Kira...

173
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,195
Keiko O'Brien.

174
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:58,746
Major.

175
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:01,291
Keiko's still in surgery

176
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,293
but she's going to be just fine.

177
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:04,794
And the baby?

178
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,591
Oh, my God.

179
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,801
No, no, Chief.

180
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,261
The baby's fine.

181
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,262
Are you sure?

182
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,722
Positive.

183
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,474
Everything's okay.

184
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,438
The baby...

185
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:26,483
just had a change of address,
that's all.

186
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:27,775
What do you mean?

187
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,130
Your son's living here now.

188
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,520
Major Kira almost
had us clear

189
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,979
of the asteroid field

190
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,524
and then the deflectors
became overwhelmed.

191
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,526
We were sideswiped
by a rock

192
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:10,735
the size
of this room.

193
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,487
A fuel pod exploded

194
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,697
and Keiko was thrown
against the bulkhead.

195
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,657
She had a concussion,
broken ribs,

196
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,076
internal hemorrhaging.

197
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:19,619
I managed to stabilize her

198
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,662
but the baby's autonomic
functions were failing.

199
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,207
I had to find another womb
for the baby

200
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,584
and the only two people
available

201
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:28,378
were Major Kira... and me.

202
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,380
I think you made
the right choice, Doctor.

203
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:37,554
But... the Major's Bajoran.

204
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,680
How can she carry a human baby?

205
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,724
Well, I had to stimulate
Kira's estrogen

206
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,435
and progesterone production

207
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:46,521
and administer high doses
of tesokine to enable the baby

208
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:48,689
to metabolize
Bajoran nutrients.

209
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,984
But the bottom line is
it worked, right?

210
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,569
Right.

211
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:57,198
So, uh, when will Keiko
be strong enough

212
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,783
to take the baby back?

213
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,328
Well, Keiko should be
up on her feet again

214
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,037
in a day or two.

215
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,705
However, the baby...

216
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,001
What?

217
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:12,088
Major Kira will have to carry
the baby to term.

218
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,882
You see, Chief,
Bajoran women

219
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,926
carry their children
for less than five months.

220
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,179
Because they have
such a short gestation period

221
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,514
they vascularize very quickly.

222
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,098
Mother and child form

223
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:25,101
a complex interconnecting
network of blood vessels.

224
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,061
And in order to transfer
the baby back to Keiko

225
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,855
I would have to sever those ties

226
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,441
which would likely cause massive
internal hemorrhaging in Kira

227
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,401
and a severe respiratory trauma
for the baby.

228
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,697
So...

229
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:41,242
what you're telling me
is that...

230
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:44,454
Major Kira's going to have
my baby?

231
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,546
(<i> door chimes</i> )

232
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:53,712
What is it?

233
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:58,926
Hello, Brother.

234
00:11:58,926 --> 00:11:59,969
You wanted to see me?

235
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,054
Come here.

236
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,307
Did you get
lots of bids?

237
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,642
I wouldn't say lots.

238
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:06,976
How many?

239
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,479
Let me count.

240
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,022
One.

241
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:13,233
Oh?

242
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,235
17 bars, three strips

243
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,070
and five slips
of latinum

244
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,946
for the entire
collection.

245
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,074
It's a generous
opening bid.

246
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:24,494
It's an insultingly
low offer.

247
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:27,746
Oh, and it
also happens to be

248
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:32,043
the exact sum total
of your life savings.

249
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,294
Oh?

250
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,796
What a coincidence.

251
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:38,049
Stop it. I don't want
your charity.

252
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,551
It's not charity.

253
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,927
I want to have something

254
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,637
to remember you by
when you're gone.

255
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,182
I knew this was a mistake.

256
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,476
But, Brother, you've
got to give it time.

257
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,562
Your body's only been
on the Exchange--

258
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:51,854
Oh, forget the bidding!

259
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,984
This has<i> all</i> been a mistake.

260
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,945
My life...

261
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,697
coming here...

262
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:04,659
putting a bar on this Cardassian
monstrosity of a station.

263
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,202
What was I thinking?!

264
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,749
(<i> monitor beeps</i> )

265
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,042
Brother,
come here quick.

266
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,711
It's a bid.

267
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:15,670
A bid.

268
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,796
A<i> huge</i> bid.

269
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,885
500 bars of latinum...

270
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,763
for the entire set.

271
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:26,180
That's 10,000 strips.

272
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,517
That's one million slips.

273
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,102
That sounds even better.

274
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:33,104
It doesn't say
who the bidder is.

275
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:34,314
It's not me.

276
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,607
No kiddin'.

277
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:37,024
You think it's Moogie?

278
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,527
No. She doesn't
like me that much.

279
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,861
She might buy one disk

280
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,113
but all 52?

281
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,365
No.

282
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,743
Who could it be?

283
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:53,040
Who could afford to spend
500 bars of latinum on me?

284
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,835
Grand Nagus Zek.

285
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,045
The Nagus?

286
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,548
Of course.
It makes perfect sense.

287
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,008
He always liked me.

288
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,718
He<i> used</i> you when it
suited his needs.

289
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:05,136
I don't think
it's the same thing.

290
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:06,763
Don't you see?

291
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,598
He used me<i> because</i> he liked me.

292
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,433
He couldn't admit
that in public.

293
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:13,353
So he made this
anonymous bid

294
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:16,773
as a gesture of his
appreciation and gratitude.

295
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,775
That doesn't sound
like the Nagus I know.

296
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:21,068
But it doesn't matter
who made the offer.

297
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,612
The important thing is

298
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:25,156
this could stimulate
further bidding.

299
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:29,327
Well, now let's
not be foolish, Rom.

300
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:31,663
If we wait

301
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:35,082
the Grand Nagus might
just change his mind.

302
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,919
Going once, going twice, sold.

303
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:46,052
Congratulations,
Brother.

304
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,722
Yeah.

305
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:51,766
It took me my whole life...

306
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:54,935
but I'm going to die a winner.

307
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,196
Hi.

308
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,156
Hi.

309
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:10,744
How are you feeling?

310
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:13,996
Like I've been hit
by a ten-ton rock.

311
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:17,751
Julian says I'll be
on my feet tomorrow.

312
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:19,753
How are you?

313
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,796
Fine.

314
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,257
Though...

315

(<i> laughs</i> )

316
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,386
I think I've put
on a little weight.

317
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:30,054
You carry it well.

318
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:37,395
You know, what...
what you're doing for me

319
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:39,606
and for us, I...

320
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:40,857
(<i> sighs</i> )

321
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:42,609
I don't know how to thank you.

322
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,026
Oh.

323
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,073
Keiko...

324
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,325
this is<i> your</i> baby.

325
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,371
(<i> laughing</i> )

326
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,709
That will pay off Moogie

327
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,711
leaving 196 bars of latinum

328
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:05,005
to pay off Uncle Gorad
and Cousin Gaila.

329
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:08,175
Is that clear?

330
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,510
I think so.

331
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,262
Good. Now, on to my
funeral arrangements.

332
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,640
First...
Quark?

333
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,768
I want my eulogy
to take place in the holosuite.

334
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,352
We'll charge admission--

335
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,562
two slips a head.

336
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,689
I don't know about that.

337
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:22,982
You're right.

338
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,651
Make it three.

339
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:25,693
Quark.

340
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,027
Huh?

341
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,572
I just received
an odd message

342
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,741
from a Dr. Orpax
of Ferenginar.

343
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,451
He wanted me to tell you
that he's very sorry

344
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:34,786
but you don't have
Dorek syndrome.

345
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,871
Does that make
any sense to you?

346
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:38,790
You don't have Dorek syndrome?

347
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,667
Do you know
what that means, Rom?

348
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,002
It means you're going to live!

349
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:50,217
It means I get to sue Dr. Orpax
for malpractice!

00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,014

00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:42,478
I'm talking about you.

371
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,438
I paid 500 bars of latinum

372
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,482
for your
desiccated remains

373
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,484
and I'm here to collect.

374
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,403
You're the anonymous buyer?

375
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,112
Well, who did
you expect?

376
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,698
The Nagus?

377
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:54,657
The Nagus?

378
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:55,867
(<i> laughing</i> )

379
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:58,202
Of course not.

380
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,788
I'm just a little
surprised it was you.

381
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,790
I guess you haven't
heard the news.

382
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,251
You mean that you
don't have Dorek syndrome?

383
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,127
I know all about it.

384
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,380
But, uh, I don't understand.

385
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,131
What are you doing here?

386
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,801
I'm here to get what I paid for.

387
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:17,597
The contract calls for 52 disks
of vacuum-desiccated Quark

388
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,306
available within six days.

389
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:22,226
I'm here to make sure
you deliver

390
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,812
the merchandise.

391
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:33,237
Maybe I wasn't clear.

392
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,781
I'm not dying.

393
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,657
Maybe<i> I</i> wasn't clear.

394
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,242
I don't care.

395
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,202
I want...

396
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,496
my merchandise.

397
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:46,584
I have a<i> thousand</i> ideas

398
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,836
of how to defile
your remains.

399
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,671
Want to hear
my favorites?

400
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,423
(<i> sighs</i> )

401
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:53,841
I see.

402
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,676
How foolish of me.

403
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,971
I forgot to mention
that on top of your full refund

404
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:01,515
you'll also be receiving an
additional five bars of latinum

405
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,976
for your troubles.

406
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,396
Did I say five?
I meant ten.

407
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,523
You drive a hard bargain.

408
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:13,820
12-- that's my final offer.

409
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,035
Look, it's late,
you've come a long way.

410
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:22,328
Why don't we stop this haggling

411
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,704
and you just tell me
how much you want?

412
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,373
What I want...

413
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:30,377
is 52 disks
of vacuum-desiccated Quark--

414
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,421
nothing more

415
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,923
nothing less.

416
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:36,884
But I'm not going
to die just yet!

417
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,928
(<i> chuckling</i> )

418
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:50,106
What do you
expect me to do?
Kill myself?

419
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:51,315
(<i> chuckling</i> )

420
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,651
Of course not.

421
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:55,862
You can have someone
do it for you.

422
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,446
I recommend
strangulation--

423
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,448
leaves the body
relatively unmarked

424
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,366
for desiccation.

425
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:01,701
You can't be serious.

426
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,870
A contract is a contract...

427
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,371
Is a contract.

428
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:06,998
I know that.

429
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:09,208
But you don't
collect on contracts

430
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,960
under these
circumstances.

431
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:19,010
We're not Klingons.

432
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,553
We're businessmen.

433
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,722
This is not business,

434
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,515
Quark.

435
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,726
This is personal.

436
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,519
But why?

437
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:31,064
What have I ever
<i>done</i> to you?

438
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,773
<i>Done</i> to me?

439
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:36,027
And you call
your brother an idiot?

440
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:39,739
Nothing you have
ever<i> done</i> to me

441
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:42,909
has been more than
a minor inconvenience, no.

442
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:46,037
Protecting your mother
from an FCA audit

443
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:49,749
and secretly settling
with your striking employees

444
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,960
were nothing
more than<i> symptoms</i>

445
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,089
of a vile and
insidious weakness...

446
00:20:56,089 --> 00:21:00,051
a weakness that
makes me loath you,

447
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:01,886
not for what you've done

448
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:04,471
but for who you are,
what you are.

449
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,224
A bartender?

450
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:09,102
A philanthropist.

451
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:11,104
I am not.

452
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:13,814
You give your customers
credit at the bar!

453
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,942
You only take
a 30 percent kickback

454
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:17,526
from your employees' tips

455
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,279
and you sold food and
medicine to Bajoran refugees

456
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,572
at cost!

457
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:23,574
That's not true.

458
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:26,285
It was just<i> above</i> cost.

459
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,745
Close enough.

460
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:32,208
It was still a generous
hu-manitarian gesture.

461
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,709
You've gone Starfleet.

462
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,377
You might as well be wearing
one of their uniforms.

463
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,796
It's people like you

464
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:39,882
that give honest Ferengi
businessmen a bad name.

465
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,175
I can reform.

466
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:43,302
I'll start gouging
the customers again.

467
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,472
I'll revoke all
my employees' vacation time.

468
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:49,767
You gave them vacations?

469
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:51,852
I didn't<i> give</i> them anything.

470
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,605
They contributed
to a central fund

471
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:56,149
which I manage...

472
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:57,191
You...

473
00:21:57,191 --> 00:22:00,069
<i>disgust</i> me.

474
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,363
Look!

475
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,743
I understand
your anger.

476
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,329
You're absolutely
right about me

477
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:15,084
but there must be some
accommodation we can make--

478
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:17,711
something other than
me killing myself.

479
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:18,963
Of course there is.

480
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:21,799
You can break the contract.

481
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:24,718
Me-- break a Ferengi
contract? Never.

482
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:25,761
Never?

483
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:26,679
Uh-uh.

484
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,181
I wonder if there's

485
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:30,474
enough Ferengi left in
you to stick to that.

486
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:33,435
Part of me hopes you<i> will</i> 
break it, because then

487
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,729
everything you and your
family own on Ferenginar

488
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:38,858
will be confiscated and
sold to the lowest bidder.

489
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,400
Your mother will be forced

490
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,402
to live on the streets,
begging for scraps of food

491
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:45,405
and, of course, no Ferengi
will do business with you

492
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:46,824
or even talk to you.

493
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,659
You'll be cut off
from all contact

494
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,077
with your own people.

495
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:54,123
I<i> like</i> Ferengi.

496
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:58,002
I-I feel comfortable
around them.

497
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:01,547
Well,<i> we</i> don't feel
comfortable around<i> you.</i>

498
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,966
You're a disease, Quark

499
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,467
a festering tumor

500
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,595
on the lobes of
Ferengi society

501
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:11,307
and it's my job
to cut you off.

502
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,903
One step at a time.

503
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,656
Yeah...

504
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,325
we're almost there.

505
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:33,871
Prepare for docking.

506
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:36,332
Thrusters back to half.

507
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:38,000
Yes.

508
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,417
(<i> sighs</i> )

509
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:41,837
Nice landing,
Captain.

510
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,421
Let me know
when you want

511
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:44,882
to get underway again.

512
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:46,550
I think I'll stay
here a week.

513
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,553
(<i> chuckling</i> )

514
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:52,139
(<i> sighs</i> )

515
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,267
Did you see Kira today?

516
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:55,559
Yeah.

517
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,395
I saw her in Ops.

518
00:23:57,395 --> 00:24:00,522
I was thinking about
inviting her to dinner.

519
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:04,902
Good idea. Maybe she could
come by<i> every</i> evening.

520
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:11,742
Even if she came by every
evening, it wouldn't be enough.

521
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:14,370
I know I'm being selfish.

522
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,038
I should be grateful

523
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:18,374
that my baby's alive and well.

524
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:23,796
But I shouldn't have
to make appointments

525
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,798
to be with my own child.

526
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:32,263
Miles, what are
we going to do?

527
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:37,435
I don't know.

528
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,613
I know what you're
thinking, Brother--

529
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:52,241
that you can't break a
sacred Ferengi tradition.

530
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:53,575
But the truth is

531
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,577
defying Ferengi
tradition isn't so bad.

532
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,079
I did it--
I formed a union.

533
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,414
Everyone said
I was crazy

534
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:00,082
that no Ferengi
would have

535
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,667
anything to do
with me.

536
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,543
They didn't want
anything to do with you

537
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:04,878
<i>before</i> you formed
the union.

538
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:07,714
If you try the
trousers on first

539
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:10,676
you'll see I've added some
extra padding to the seat

540
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:13,804
which should make swiveling
on your barstool

541
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:15,513
much more comfortable.

542
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:23,939
I'm afraid<i> your</i> pants won't be
ready until next week, Quark.

543
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,649
That's not
why I'm here.

544
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:28,152
Ah! And what can I do for you?

545
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:31,697
I want to hire you,
not as a tailor--

546
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,657
as an assassin.

547
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,954
I don't know
what you're talking about.

548
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,165
Oh, yes, you do.

549
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:43,541
You weren't
always a tailor.

550
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:45,002
You're right.

551
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:47,129
I used to be a gardener.

552
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:50,590
Now, if you have something you
want weeded, you let me know.

553
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,677
Not some<i> thing...</i>

554
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,346
some<i> one.</i>

555
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:59,058
You're going to have
Brunt killed.

556
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:01,810
I didn't think
you had it in you, Brother.

557
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,730
What a bold,
uncompromising move.

558
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,648
Would you be quiet?

559
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:11,611
I don't want you to kill Brunt.

560
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:13,364
I want you to kill me.

561
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,795
You want me to kill<i> you.</i>

562
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:31,631
Well, that's different.

563
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:33,759
Something swift
and painless

564
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,635
and preferably
bloodless...

565
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:38,514
though I imagine that's
not always possible.

566
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:39,723
Wait a minute!

567
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,559
You can't do this.

568
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:43,519
I thought you were going
to break the contract.

569
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,354
What are
the key words there?

570
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:46,313
<i>You</i> thought.

571
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,314
But, Brother...

572
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,816
Don't "Brother" me, Rom.

573
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:51,985
I'm not like you or Nog
or Moogie

574
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,695
or the rest
of our pathetic family.

575
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:57,283
I'm a Ferengi businessman.

576
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:01,078
And I made a contract.

577
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:03,872
And a contract
is a contract is...

578
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,750
Don't quote
Rules of Acquisition to me!

579
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,877
This is your life
we're talking about!

580
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,170
That's right.

581
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,047
<i>My</i> life!

582
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,466
What's the most important
thing in my life?

583
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:15,092
Business.

584
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:17,928
That's who I am.

585
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:19,513
That's what I do.

586
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:21,348
I'm a businessman.

587
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:25,227
And more than that,
I'm a Ferengi businessman.

588
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:27,313
Do you know what that means?

589
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:29,356
It means that I'm
not exploiting

590
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,150
and cheating people at random.

591
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:35,779
I'm doing it according
to a specific set of rules.

592
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:40,075
The Rules of Acquisition.

593
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:43,370
And I won't disregard them
when I find them inconvenient.

594
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,247
Inconvenient?

595
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:47,707
You're going to die!

596
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:53,088
Yes.

597
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:56,342
And when I arrive at the gates
of the Divine Treasury

598
00:27:56,342 --> 00:28:00,638
the Registrar will accept
my bribe and usher me inside

599
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:02,515
and do you know why?

600
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:07,811
Because I died
<i>exactly</i> the way I lived--

601
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,480
as a Ferengi!

602
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:15,861
Garak, let's
talk about death.

603
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:23,952
(<i> gasps</i> )

604
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,371
He's kicking so hard.

605
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:27,164
Do you think
he's all right?

606
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:28,832
Oh, it's a good sign.

607
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:31,168
Molly--
I thought she was going

608
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:33,295
to kick her way out of me.

609
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:36,674
Lower back, huh?

610
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:38,008
(<i> groans</i> )

611
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:40,260
Hold on. I have
just the thing.

612
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:45,599
It was so thoughtful of you
to share this with us.

613
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:46,975
Thank you, Major.

614
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:50,354
Please...<i> Nerys.</i>

615
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:53,106
So, um,
any morning sickness?

616
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,525
What's that?

617
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:57,653
Well, I don't know
how it is for Bajorans

618
00:28:57,653 --> 00:29:00,989
but, typically, human mothers
wake up feeling nauseous.

619
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:04,076
Well, it doesn't work
that way for Bajorans.

620
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:07,079
Typically, we start
sneezing-- uncontrollably.

621
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,289
But this is a human baby.

622
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,625
I don't know what to expect.

623
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,627
Here you go.

624
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:14,961
Oh...

625
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,505
Slide that in there.

626
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:18,090
Get this side...
Sorry.

627
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,258
Better?

628
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:20,300
I'm hungry.

629
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,385
Oh, much.

630
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:22,595
Put your
feet up.

631
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:23,970
Oh, no, no, that's fine.

632
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,389
It<i> is</i> about that time.

633
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:26,765
I'll get dinner started.

634
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,808
I should be going
back to my quarters.

635
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:30,977
Why? Have dinner
with us.

636
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:32,563
I don't want to impose.

637
00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:34,648
Nerys, you're having
our baby.

638
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:35,982
You're family now.

639
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,651
That's right.

640
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:40,696
In fact, Keiko and I have been
talking about something.

641
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:42,114
(<i> clears throat</i> )

642
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:43,574
Well, we have an idea

643
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:45,200
that we'd like
you to consider.

644
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,368
It's just an idea.

645
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,412
We don't want to pressure you.

646
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:49,622
I understand.
What is it?

647
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,208
Go ahead.

648
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:03,510
Mmm... mmm!

649
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:05,804
Ooh.

650
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:08,724
Mmm.

651
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,144
(<i> gasps</i> )

652
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,687
(<i> bones snapping</i> )

653
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:21,779
How's that?

654
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:28,327
Awful!

655
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:33,165
Did you hear that sound
of bone snapping?

656
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:35,668
I don't want that to be
the last thing I hear.

657
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:38,671
It wasn't that loud.

658
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:40,172
You don't have these ears.

659
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,424
Snapping vertebrae is<i> out.</i>

660
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:45,010
We're running
out of options, Quark.

661
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,513
You don't want to be vaporized
because you need a body.

662
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:48,888
The disrupter ruined

663
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:51,558
your clothing,
the knife was too savage

664
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,101
the nerve gas smelled bad

665
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,604
hanging took too long
and poison...

666
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,105
What was wrong with poison?

667
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,691
It doesn't work!

668
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:01,485
If I know the food is
poisoned, I won't eat it.

669
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:02,986
Could you get rid of this?

670
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,113
The sight of it
is making me sick.

671
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,657
Computer, remove corpse.

672
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:08,867
For a man who wants
to kill himself

673
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,577
you are strangely
determined to live.

674
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,454
I'm going to die--
don't you worry about that.

675
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:13,789
I just want to find
the right way.

676
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:14,873
Right way?

677
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,750
I don't want to see it coming

678
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:20,295
or hear it or feel it
or smell it.

679
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:23,632
I just want to go on with
my life and then... I'm dead.

680
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:24,675
Ah.

681
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:25,759
(<i> snaps fingers</i> )

682
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,678
You want to be surprised.

683
00:31:27,678 --> 00:31:30,389
Exactly. I want to wake up
in the Divine Treasury

684
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:32,516
and have no idea
how I got there.

685
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:33,767
I see.

686
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:37,771
Perhaps that can be arranged.

687
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:39,314
Really.

688
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,983
You have my word.

689
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,610
You'll never know

690
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,904
what hit you.

691
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,296
(<i> breathing heavily</i> )

692
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:12,472
Computer?

693
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:13,640
Lights.

694
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:23,149
Garak, if you're in here...

695
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:25,611
I'm not going to be surprised!

696
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:54,890
Where am I?

697
00:32:57,434 --> 00:33:00,270
"Please have your profit
and loss statement

698
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,730
"ready for inspection...

699
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,818
before entering
the Divine Treasury."

700
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,738
I'm dead.

701
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:15,201
Garak, you're good.

702
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:26,129
I'm really dead.

703
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,299
You're not just dead, Quark...

704
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,135
you're an idiot!

705
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,219
(<i> laughing</i> )

706
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,221
Who... are you?

707
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:38,934
I am Gint,
the first Grand Nagus.

708
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:41,812
You look like...

709
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:44,189
like my brother Rom.

710
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:47,609
That's because this is
a dream, you imbecile.

711
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,820
So...

712
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,656
I'm not dead.
What a clever boy--

713
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:53,991
always thinking.

714
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:55,408
I'm asleep.

715
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:58,745
That explains why
this place looks so tacky.

716
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:02,290
I mean, the Divine Treasury...

717
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,709
please.

718
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:06,378
Don't blame me
for your limited imagination.

719
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:09,088
Now, I'll make it simple.

720
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:12,258
You have to break
the contract with Brunt.

721
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,095
You got to be joking.

722
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:17,806
You're Gint.

723
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:20,058
You wrote
<i>The Rules of Acquisition--</i>

724
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:24,021
the scared precepts upon which
all Ferengi society is based.

725
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:27,607
Oh, you of all people
can't expect me to break them.

726
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:30,443
Why not?
They're just rules.

727
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:34,113
They're written in a book

728
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:36,074
not carved in stone.

729
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,827
And even if they were in stone,
so what?

730
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:41,246
A bunch of us just made them up.

731
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:43,331
Are you saying
they don't matter?

732
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,708
Of course they matter!

733
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:46,710
That's why
they're a best seller.

734
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,046
But we're talking
about your life here.

735
00:34:49,046 --> 00:34:51,798
The Rules are nothing
but guideposts...

736
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:52,799
suggestions.

737
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,134
Then why call them "Rules"?

738
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:58,931
Would you buy a book called
<i>Suggestions of Acquisition?</i>

739
00:34:58,931 --> 00:35:00,015
Doesn't quite have

740
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:01,725
the same ring
to it, does it?

741
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:03,643
You mean it was
a marketing ploy?

742
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,478
Shh!

743
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,356
A brilliant one.

744
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:11,150
Rule of Acquisition 239:

745
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:14,404
"Never be afraid
to mislabel a product."

746
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:18,575
I've based my entire life
around these Rules.

747
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:20,911
How can I just walk
away from them?

748
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,123
Because I'm
telling you to.

749
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,584
But you can't do that.

750
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:30,295
You're not Gint.

751
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:32,965
This is just a dream.

752
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:34,549
Exactly.

753
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,009
And I wouldn't be here

754
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:38,386
if you didn't<i> want</i>
to break the Rules.

755
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,680
You just need
someone's permission.

756
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,349
So I'm giving it to you.

757
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,518
I suppose...

758
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:48,605
if the First Nagus Gint

759
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:51,066
came to me in a vision

760
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:54,527
and told me to
<i>break</i> the Rules...

761
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:58,239
that would be all right.

762
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,783
BRUNT:
Quark, hold
it right there!

763
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:02,786
Brunt, FCA.

764
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:04,329
What are you doing here?

765
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:05,747
This is a private vision.

766
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:07,290
I'm here to remind you

767
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,835
of the consequences
of disregarding the Rules--

768
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:12,754
poverty, destitution,
exile.

769
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:15,173
I know.
I know, but look!

770
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,509
Gint himself has come
to me in a vision.

771
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:20,386
He's telling me
to break the contract.

772
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:21,680
That is
not Gint.

773
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,098
Gint was a lot taller.

774
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:25,308
You listen to that
fraud, you'll regret it

775
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,893
for the rest of your
miserable life.

776
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:30,647
I say we kill him right now.

777
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:32,440
This is a dream.

778
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,693
You can't kill me.

779
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,987
However...

780
00:36:36,987 --> 00:36:41,783
people have been known
to die in their sleep.

781
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:46,079
Come on!
Rom!

782
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,831
Gint-- whatever
your name is!

783
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:49,124
Help me.

784
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:50,458
He's got a point,
Quark.

785
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,459
It's a dream.

786
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,670
I can't really
do anything.

787
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:57,423
But if you want to live,
break the contract.

788
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:59,134
It's your only hope.

789
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:02,846
(<i> gasping</i> )

790
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,934
I'm alive.

791
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:10,520
(<i> sighs</i> )

792
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,314
I find it surprising

793
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:17,027
that someone with such long,
slender and nimble fingers

794
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:20,989
has never
practiced<i> oo-mox.</i>

795
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:25,118
Come to beg
for your life?

796
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,707
What is this?

797
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:32,751
I am returning
your 500 bars of latinum

798
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:34,211
plus interest.

799
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:38,215
I told you I wasn't
interested in a refund.

800
00:37:38,215 --> 00:37:39,340
I know.

801
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,468
I'm breaking the contract.

802
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:45,346
(<i> laughing</i> )

803
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,015
I knew it.

804
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:49,726
You're just like the
rest of your family--

805
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:52,395
weak-lobed degenerates...

806
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,689
another loser

807
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:58,818
in a long line
of failed Ferengis.

808
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:00,361
Look, I've broken
the contract

809
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,114
so do your job--

810
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:05,117
take my assets, revoke
my Ferengi business license.

811
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:08,661
Do whatever you have to do,
then get out.

812
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:13,583
And if I ever see you
walk into my bar again...

813
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:15,877
Yes?

814
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:18,630
You won't walk out.

815
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:24,928
May I have your
attention, please?!

816
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:30,934
Brunt, FCA.

817
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:34,395
As of this moment, no
further Ferengi commerce

818
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:36,856
may be conducted
in this bar.

819
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,985
No Ferengi may be
employed by this bar

820
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:42,487
no Ferengi may eat or drink
in this bar

821
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:45,031
and no Ferengi--

822
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,950
<i>no</i> Ferengi!--

823
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:50,287
may do business with<i> that</i> man!

824
00:38:56,417 --> 00:39:00,463
Confiscation of assets
will begin immediately.

825
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,761
Ladies and gentlemen...

826
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,889
this bar is closed
until further notice.

827
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:14,519
Thank you for your patronage.

828
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:41,921
(<i> door chimes</i> )

829
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,422
O'BRIEN:
Come in.

830
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:47,135
I'll take that,
Major. Oh-- Nerys.

831
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,553
Is this it?

832
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:49,971
Oh, I travel light.

833
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:51,848
Would you like
to see your room?

834
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:53,016
Sure.

835
00:40:05,362 --> 00:40:07,155
Welcome to
your new home.

836
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:10,325
At least until the baby is born.

837
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:12,077
Are you my aunt?

838
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:16,622
Well...

839
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,208
Sounds right to me.

840
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:24,089
Aunt Nerys.

841
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:26,465
Aunt Nerys,
can I play in your room?

842
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:28,927
Anytime you want.

843
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:02,627
How are you,
Brother?

844
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:04,337
How<i> am</i> I?

845
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:06,214
I'm broke...

846
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:09,259
ruined, destitute...

847
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:10,509
a pariah.

848
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:11,719
How are things with you?

849
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,804
Not bad.

850
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,472
Glad to hear it.

851
00:41:24,274 --> 00:41:26,025
They took everything?

852
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,735
Mm-hmm.

853
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,695
Including this shirt.

854
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:33,908
I'm supposed
to send it to Brunt
in the morning.

855
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:37,829
Don't worry.
I have some old clothes
I was going to throw out.

856
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:39,247
Hmph.

857
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:41,249
I'd rather be naked.

858
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:43,001
Okay.

859
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:45,795
Brother, the way

860
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:47,880
you stood up to Brunt...

861
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:53,178
Well, I want you to know
that I'm very proud of you.

862
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:55,888
Well, then...

863
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:59,225
I guess throwing my entire
life away was worth it.

864
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,269
I wouldn't go that far.

865
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:02,561
Mmm.

866
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:08,193
So, what are you going
to do now?

867
00:42:09,486 --> 00:42:10,987
Well, Rom...

868
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,033
I've been thinking long and hard

869
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:16,493
and you know what?

870
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:20,163
I don't have a clue.

871
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:22,999
Quark, where do you want this?

872
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:24,083
What is it?

873
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,503
A case of
Alvanian brandy.

874
00:42:26,503 --> 00:42:28,421
A patient sent
it as payment

875
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:30,089
but I can't accept it.

876
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,216
Nice try, Doctor

877
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:33,009
but I don't want
your charity.

878
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:35,470
Oh, it's not charity.
I find it undrinkable.

879
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,472
So, do you want it
or shall I dump it?

880
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:40,725
(<i> bottles clattering</i> )

881
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:43,228
Quark, my sister
sent me these.

882
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:44,687
I thought you
might want them.

883
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,647
But they're really ugly.

884
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:52,404
They're not as ugly
as the old ones

885
00:42:52,404 --> 00:42:53,863
but they're pretty bad.

886
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:55,407
This is all very amusing

887
00:42:55,407 --> 00:42:57,992
but I can't start a bar
with a case of bad brandy

888
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:59,411
and a set of...

889
00:42:59,411 --> 00:43:02,163
<i>ugly</i> glasses.

890
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:03,581
SISKO:
Quark.

891
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,750
Yes, Captain?

892
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,419
We're doing some
structural repair

893
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:08,961
on Level 2 of
the Habitat Ring.

894
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,547
We need a place to store
some extra furniture

895
00:43:10,547 --> 00:43:11,797
for the next few months

896
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:13,466
and it looks like
you have the room.

897
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:20,181
Captain, where do
you want me to put

898
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:21,640
all this furniture?

899
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,351
We have three levels,
Constable, use them all.

900
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:24,602
Understood.

901
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,854
Captain, you can't do this!

902
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:32,151
Not without paying
a storage fee.

903
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:37,240
A minimum storage fee--
practically nothing.

904
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:39,784
Send me the bill.

905
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,703
QUARK: All right.

906
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,330
Don't just stand there, Odo.

907
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,623
Move it all in.

908
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:46,707
Ah!

909
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,549
Look at them, Brother.

910
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:57,760
And you thought
you had no assets.

911
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,845
Sisko, Dax,

912
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:02,056
Bashir, Morn...

913
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,724
