1
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:12,480
I never should have let her go,
not in her condition.

2
00:00:12,517 --> 00:00:15,853
Chief, I am certain
Dr. Bashir and Major Kira

3
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,484
are taking good care
of your wife.

4
00:00:17,527 --> 00:00:19,394
And besides,
you know there's no way

5
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,195
you could have kept
Keiko from going.

6
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:22,291
She's been talking

7
00:00:22,336 --> 00:00:24,568
about the botanical
mysteries on Torad V

8
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,339
for a long time.

9
00:00:26,377 --> 00:00:29,178
You're lucky she agreed
to limit the trip to three days.

10
00:00:29,216 --> 00:00:31,345
Three days
in the Gamma Quadrant.

11
00:00:31,387 --> 00:00:33,380
Do you know what she
wanted to do last week?

12
00:00:33,425 --> 00:00:34,393
What?

13
00:00:34,427 --> 00:00:35,759
She wanted to go back to Bajor

14
00:00:35,797 --> 00:00:38,063
and rappel down
the cliffs of Undalar

15
00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:40,003
to get a fungus sample.

16
00:00:40,038 --> 00:00:42,976
Rappel to get fungus.

17
00:00:43,011 --> 00:00:45,243
It's as if I have to remind her
that she's pregnant.

18
00:00:45,282 --> 00:00:46,648
Yeah.

19
00:00:46,685 --> 00:00:49,178
I guess the extra weight,
the morning sickness

20
00:00:49,223 --> 00:00:50,248
the mood swings

21
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:51,988
the medical examinations...

22
00:00:52,029 --> 00:00:53,999
they aren't reminders enough.

23
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:55,331
I have work to do.

24
00:00:58,976 --> 00:00:59,966
Hey!

25
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,448
Dabo!

26
00:01:02,483 --> 00:01:04,043
Very good!
We have a winner!

27
00:01:04,086 --> 00:01:06,785
Rom! My brother!

28
00:01:06,825 --> 00:01:09,057
I'm glad to see you.

29
00:01:09,096 --> 00:01:11,464
Let me pour you a snail juice.

30
00:01:11,501 --> 00:01:13,733
Okay, but only one.

31
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:15,207
My shift starts in 33 minutes.

32
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:16,403
I'll make it a tall one

33
00:01:16,444 --> 00:01:17,673
and it's on the house.

34
00:01:17,714 --> 00:01:18,682
We're celebrating.

35
00:01:18,716 --> 00:01:20,686
Celebrating?!

36
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,587
What?

37
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:25,026
My return from two weeks
on Ferenginar.

38
00:01:25,061 --> 00:01:26,029
Didn't you miss me?

39
00:01:26,063 --> 00:01:27,429
Uh, I suppose.

40
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:29,936
And I missed you.

41
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:32,841
That's two reasons
for celebrating.

42
00:01:32,877 --> 00:01:34,403
Enjoy.

43
00:01:34,447 --> 00:01:35,472
Thanks.

44
00:01:36,484 --> 00:01:38,181
Just the way you like it?

45
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:40,685
Perfect.

46
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:44,424
So, how was your trip?

47
00:01:44,467 --> 00:01:45,765
Did you close
the vole belly deal?

48
00:01:45,803 --> 00:01:46,964
The what?

49
00:01:47,005 --> 00:01:50,307
Oh, yeah. Closed it
on the first day.

50
00:01:50,345 --> 00:01:51,939
15 percent profit margin.

51
00:01:51,982 --> 00:01:52,950
Great.

52
00:01:52,984 --> 00:01:54,647
Did you see Moogie?

53
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,656
Mother's fine.

54
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,851
She sends her love.

55
00:01:56,892 --> 00:01:58,828
What else did you do?

56
00:01:58,863 --> 00:02:02,029
Well, let's see, uh...

57
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:03,367
I closed the deal...
told you that.

58
00:02:03,404 --> 00:02:04,964
Did some shopping...

59
00:02:05,008 --> 00:02:07,707
Made a pilgrimage
to the Great Marketplace.

60
00:02:07,747 --> 00:02:09,649
And, uh... oh, yes.

61
00:02:09,684 --> 00:02:11,415
I found out, uh...

62
00:02:14,126 --> 00:02:15,458
I'm...

63
00:02:15,495 --> 00:02:17,021
I'm dying!

64
00:02:25,348 --> 00:02:28,081
What are you all looking at?

65
00:02:28,121 --> 00:02:30,182
Haven't you ever seen
a dying man before?

66
00:04:32,102 --> 00:04:33,400
You're dying?

67
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:38,010
I got my results

68
00:04:38,047 --> 00:04:40,347
from my annual
insurance physical.

69
00:04:40,385 --> 00:04:44,120
All the tests came back
negative except for one.

70
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,561
I have Dorek syndrome.

71
00:04:46,597 --> 00:04:49,033
But... that's incurable.

72
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:50,435
That's right

73
00:04:50,471 --> 00:04:52,907
which explains the dying part.

74
00:04:52,944 --> 00:04:55,312
But... Dorek syndrome...

75
00:04:55,348 --> 00:04:56,407
it's so rare.

76
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,611
It strikes

77
00:04:57,652 --> 00:05:00,145
only one out of every
five million Ferengi.

78
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:03,061
I finally beat the odds.

79
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,066
How long do you have before?

80
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:11,945
According to Dr. Orpax,
six days...

81
00:05:11,982 --> 00:05:13,314
maybe seven.

82
00:05:13,351 --> 00:05:14,649
Is he sure?

83
00:05:14,686 --> 00:05:16,656
Oh, of course, he's sure.

84
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,319
He's one of the most
expensive doctors

85
00:05:18,361 --> 00:05:19,329
on Ferenginar.

86
00:05:19,363 --> 00:05:21,026
He charges two slips of latinum

87
00:05:21,066 --> 00:05:23,002
just to walk
into the waiting room.

88
00:05:23,037 --> 00:05:24,904
This is terrible!

89
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:27,241
I don't want you to die,
Brother.

90
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:29,146
Maybe you should get
a second opinion.

91
00:05:29,182 --> 00:05:30,981
Have Dr. Bashir examine you
when he gets back

92
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:31,988
from the Gamma Quadrant.

93
00:05:32,022 --> 00:05:33,490
Bashir?
How good could he be?

94
00:05:33,591 --> 00:05:35,493
He doesn't even charge.

95
00:05:35,595 --> 00:05:39,626
Besides, what could
a hu-man doctor know

96
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,867
about Dorek syndrome?

97
00:05:44,046 --> 00:05:46,448
You're going to die!

98
00:05:49,022 --> 00:05:53,190
I have six days to take care
of everything... my will...

99
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,200
Moogie's pension.

100
00:05:55,234 --> 00:05:57,534
I have to make
funeral arrangements.

101
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:58,868
Pay off my debts.

102
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:00,776
That's a lot of debts, Brother.

103
00:06:00,812 --> 00:06:03,716
Yes, but half of those
are to hu-mans, Bajorans

104
00:06:03,751 --> 00:06:04,980
a couple of Klingons.

105
00:06:05,021 --> 00:06:06,148
Rule of Acquisition 17:

106
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,092
A contract is a contract
is a contract

107
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,459
but only between Ferengi.

108
00:06:10,498 --> 00:06:12,593
Exactly.

109
00:06:12,635 --> 00:06:14,103
But you're right.

110
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:20,244
It's still a lot of debt.

111
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,779
You could always sell

112
00:06:22,822 --> 00:06:24,689
the desiccated remains
of your corpse

113
00:06:24,726 --> 00:06:26,423
on the Ferengi Futures Exchange.

114
00:06:26,463 --> 00:06:29,958
Who'd want to buy a disk
of desiccated Quark?

115
00:06:30,004 --> 00:06:31,735
I'm nobody...

116
00:06:31,774 --> 00:06:34,541
just some bartender
with a domineering mother

117
00:06:34,613 --> 00:06:36,081
and an idiot brother.

118
00:06:36,116 --> 00:06:37,915
You were the Grand Nagus.

119
00:06:37,953 --> 00:06:39,216
For a week.

120
00:06:39,256 --> 00:06:43,891
If I'm lucky, I'll be a footnote
in some...

121
00:06:43,932 --> 00:06:45,868
Ferengi financial almanac.

122
00:06:45,902 --> 00:06:48,202
You anticipated
the change of administrations

123
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,869
here on the station.

124
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:51,972
And as a reward

125
00:06:52,015 --> 00:06:55,419
I'm inextricably linked
to the Federation.

126
00:06:57,425 --> 00:07:00,956
I'm a joke on Ferenginar.

127
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:03,527
Starfleet's favorite bartender!

128
00:07:03,571 --> 00:07:05,803
The synthehol king!

129
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,140
What a legacy.

130
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:08,807
You're not a joke here.

131
00:07:08,848 --> 00:07:10,943
You're a respected
businessman...

132
00:07:10,986 --> 00:07:12,819
a pillar of the community

133
00:07:12,856 --> 00:07:15,555
a man with... many friends.

134
00:07:15,628 --> 00:07:17,119
Friends?

135
00:07:17,165 --> 00:07:19,135
Community?

136
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:22,573
You sound like
some sniveling hu-man.

137
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:26,481
The only opinions I care about
are those of my peers...

138
00:07:26,517 --> 00:07:28,987
Ferengi businessmen.

139
00:07:29,022 --> 00:07:31,083
In their eyes

140
00:07:31,126 --> 00:07:35,089
I'm a second-rate,
small-time operator.

141
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:41,502
Stop it!

142
00:07:41,547 --> 00:07:43,517
Stop it, Brother!

143
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:45,453
You are somebody.

144
00:07:45,488 --> 00:07:47,185
You'll see.

145
00:07:47,225 --> 00:07:49,753
You march right over
to that com link

146
00:07:49,796 --> 00:07:52,198
and offer your
vacuum-desiccated remains

147
00:07:52,235 --> 00:07:54,364
for sale
on the Futures Exchange.

148
00:07:54,406 --> 00:07:55,533
You'll see.

149
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,135
Bids'll come flooding in

150
00:07:57,178 --> 00:07:59,444
from all over
the Ferengi Alliance.

151
00:07:59,482 --> 00:08:02,215
Everyone will want a disk
of Quark on their desk.

152
00:08:02,255 --> 00:08:04,691
In fact, there may
not be enough of you

153
00:08:04,726 --> 00:08:06,160
to meet the demand.

154
00:08:07,398 --> 00:08:09,163
You're a liar, but I love you.

155
00:08:09,202 --> 00:08:11,035
Just wait.

156
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:14,740
When you see how much
your body is worth

157
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:17,876
you're going to wish
you died years ago...

158
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,720
or something like that.

159
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:29,537
Captain, something's coming
through the wormhole.

160
00:08:29,572 --> 00:08:30,562
On screen.

161
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:35,911
Magnify.

162
00:08:38,323 --> 00:08:39,586
The <i>Volga.</i>

163
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,288
It has been damaged.

164
00:08:41,329 --> 00:08:43,162
Dr. Bashir is requesting

165
00:08:43,199 --> 00:08:45,669
emergency transport
to the Infirmary.

166
00:08:45,704 --> 00:08:46,967
Two patients:

167
00:08:47,006 --> 00:08:48,976
Major Kira...

168
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,444
Keiko O'Brien.

169
00:08:59,965 --> 00:09:01,058
Major.

170
00:09:01,102 --> 00:09:03,265
Keiko's still in surgery

171
00:09:03,306 --> 00:09:05,606
but she's going to be just fine.

172
00:09:05,644 --> 00:09:07,375
And the baby?

173
00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:12,956
Oh, my God.

174
00:09:12,991 --> 00:09:14,118
No, no, Chief.

175
00:09:14,161 --> 00:09:15,629
The baby's fine.

176
00:09:15,664 --> 00:09:16,689
Are you sure?

177
00:09:16,732 --> 00:09:18,098
Positive.

178
00:09:18,136 --> 00:09:19,833
Everything's okay.

179
00:09:23,346 --> 00:09:25,748
The baby...

180
00:09:25,784 --> 00:09:28,779
just had a change of address,
that's all.

181
00:09:28,823 --> 00:09:30,086
What do you mean?

182
00:09:49,063 --> 00:09:51,591
Your son's living here now.

183
00:10:04,695 --> 00:10:08,065
Major Kira almost had us clear
of the asteroid field

184
00:10:08,101 --> 00:10:10,698
and then the deflectors
became overwhelmed.

185
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,008
We were sideswiped by a rock
the size of this room.

186
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:15,676
A fuel pod exploded

187
00:10:15,717 --> 00:10:18,017
and Keiko was thrown
against the bulkhead.

188
00:10:18,055 --> 00:10:19,957
She had a concussion,
broken ribs

189
00:10:19,992 --> 00:10:21,290
internal hemorrhaging.

190
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,524
I managed to stabilize her

191
00:10:22,564 --> 00:10:24,830
but the baby's autonomic
functions were failing.

192
00:10:24,868 --> 00:10:27,431
I had to find another womb
for the baby

193
00:10:27,474 --> 00:10:28,703
and the only two people
available

194
00:10:28,743 --> 00:10:31,544
were Major Kira... and me.

195
00:10:31,616 --> 00:10:33,711
I think you made
the right choice, Doctor.

196
00:10:37,594 --> 00:10:40,657
But... the Major's Bajoran.

197
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,966
How can she carry a human baby?

198
00:10:43,005 --> 00:10:45,032
Well, I had to stimulate
Kira's estrogen

199
00:10:45,075 --> 00:10:46,669
and progesterone production

200
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:49,878
and administer high doses
of tesokine to enable the baby

201
00:10:49,918 --> 00:10:52,013
to metabolize
Bajoran nutrients.

202
00:10:52,056 --> 00:10:54,253
But the bottom line is
it worked, right?

203
00:10:54,295 --> 00:10:55,889
Right.

204
00:10:57,467 --> 00:11:00,439
So, uh, when will Keiko
be strong enough

205
00:11:00,473 --> 00:11:02,170
to take the baby back?

206
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,841
Well, Keiko should be
up on her feet again

207
00:11:04,882 --> 00:11:06,077
in a day or two.

208
00:11:06,117 --> 00:11:08,144
However, the baby...

209
00:11:09,591 --> 00:11:11,288
What?

210
00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:15,463
Major Kira will have to carry
the baby to term.

211
00:11:15,503 --> 00:11:18,202
You see, Chief, Bajoran women

212
00:11:18,242 --> 00:11:20,235
carry their children
for less than five months.

213
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,580
Because they have
such a short gestation period

214
00:11:22,617 --> 00:11:24,143
they vascularize very quickly.

215
00:11:24,188 --> 00:11:25,486
Mother and child form

216
00:11:25,523 --> 00:11:28,518
a complex interconnecting
network of blood vessels.

217
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,465
And in order to transfer
the baby back to Keiko

218
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,968
I would have to sever those ties

219
00:11:32,002 --> 00:11:34,838
which would likely cause massive
internal hemorrhaging in Kira

220
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,936
and a severe respiratory trauma
for the baby.

221
00:11:40,152 --> 00:11:42,315
So...

222
00:11:42,357 --> 00:11:44,725
what you're telling me
is that...

223
00:11:44,762 --> 00:11:47,996
Major Kira's going to have
my baby?

224
00:11:56,151 --> 00:11:57,414
What is it?

225
00:12:01,194 --> 00:12:02,423
Hello, Brother.

226
00:12:02,464 --> 00:12:03,432
You wanted to see me?

227
00:12:03,466 --> 00:12:04,627
Come here.

228
00:12:05,637 --> 00:12:07,607
Did you get lots of bids?

229
00:12:07,707 --> 00:12:09,107
I wouldn't say lots.

230
00:12:09,143 --> 00:12:10,372
How many?

231
00:12:10,413 --> 00:12:12,976
Let me count.

232
00:12:13,018 --> 00:12:14,612
One.

233
00:12:14,655 --> 00:12:16,625
Oh?

234
00:12:16,659 --> 00:12:20,565
17 bars, three strips
and five slips of latinum

235
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,502
for the entire collection.

236
00:12:22,537 --> 00:12:24,530
It's a generous opening bid.

237
00:12:24,575 --> 00:12:27,843
It's an insultingly low offer.

238
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:31,047
Oh, and it also happens to be

239
00:12:31,087 --> 00:12:35,654
the exact sum total
of your life savings.

240
00:12:35,697 --> 00:12:36,892
Oh?

241
00:12:36,932 --> 00:12:39,334
What a coincidence.

242
00:12:39,371 --> 00:12:41,534
Stop it.
I don't want your charity.

243
00:12:41,575 --> 00:12:43,066
It's not charity.

244
00:12:43,111 --> 00:12:44,306
I want to have something

245
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:46,147
to remember you by
when you're gone.

246
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:49,652
I knew this was a mistake.

247
00:12:49,691 --> 00:12:51,957
But, Brother,
you've got to give it time.

248
00:12:51,996 --> 00:12:54,091
Your body's only been
on the Exchange...

249
00:12:54,133 --> 00:12:55,328
Oh, forget the bidding!

250
00:12:57,407 --> 00:13:00,470
This has all been a mistake.

251
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,540
My life...

252
00:13:02,584 --> 00:13:04,075
coming here...

253
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,151
putting a bar on this Cardassian
monstrosity of a station.

254
00:13:08,194 --> 00:13:09,754
What was I thinking?!

255
00:13:15,242 --> 00:13:16,505
Brother, come here quick.

256
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,174
It's a bid.

257
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,182
A bid.

258
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:21,448
A huge bid.

259
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:26,329
500 bars of latinum...

260
00:13:26,365 --> 00:13:28,301
for the entire set.

261
00:13:28,336 --> 00:13:29,599
That's 10,000 strips.

262
00:13:29,638 --> 00:13:32,838
That's one million slips.

263
00:13:32,877 --> 00:13:34,574
That sounds even better.

264
00:13:34,615 --> 00:13:36,710
It doesn't say
who the bidder is.

265
00:13:36,819 --> 00:13:37,809
It's not me.

266
00:13:37,854 --> 00:13:38,981
No kidding.

267
00:13:39,023 --> 00:13:40,549
You think it's Moogie?

268
00:13:40,593 --> 00:13:42,893
No. She doesn't
like me that much.

269
00:13:42,931 --> 00:13:44,331
She might buy one disk

270
00:13:44,368 --> 00:13:45,734
but all 52?

271
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:47,740
No.

272
00:13:47,774 --> 00:13:50,074
Who could it be?

273
00:13:50,112 --> 00:13:56,683
Who could afford to spend
500 bars of latinum on me?

274
00:13:58,896 --> 00:14:00,364
Grand Nagus Zek.

275
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,527
The Nagus?

276
00:14:01,568 --> 00:14:04,038
Of course.
It makes perfect sense.

277
00:14:04,073 --> 00:14:05,507
He always liked me.

278
00:14:05,543 --> 00:14:07,069
He used you when it
suited his needs.

279
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:08,546
I don't think
it's the same thing.

280
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:10,211
Don't you see?

281
00:14:10,252 --> 00:14:11,949
He used me because he liked me.

282
00:14:11,989 --> 00:14:13,720
He couldn't admit
that in public.

283
00:14:13,826 --> 00:14:16,730
So he made this anonymous bid

284
00:14:16,765 --> 00:14:20,169
as a gesture of his
appreciation and gratitude.

285
00:14:20,205 --> 00:14:22,175
That doesn't sound
like the Nagus I know.

286
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:24,509
But it doesn't matter
who made the offer.

287
00:14:24,548 --> 00:14:25,948
The important thing is

288
00:14:25,983 --> 00:14:28,614
this could stimulate
further bidding.

289
00:14:28,656 --> 00:14:32,892
Well, now let's
not be foolish, Rom.

290
00:14:32,931 --> 00:14:39,001
If we wait, the Grand Nagus
might just change his mind.

291
00:14:39,043 --> 00:14:42,574
Going once, going twice, sold.

292
00:14:47,326 --> 00:14:49,489
Congratulations, Brother.

293
00:14:49,531 --> 00:14:52,024
Yeah.

294
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:55,303
It took me my whole life...

295
00:14:55,342 --> 00:14:58,610
but I'm going to die a winner.

296
00:15:07,076 --> 00:15:10,412
- Hi.
- Hi.

297
00:15:11,986 --> 00:15:13,819
How are you feeling?

298
00:15:13,856 --> 00:15:17,226
Like I've been hit
by a ten-ton rock.

299
00:15:17,263 --> 00:15:20,930
Julian says I'll be
on my feet tomorrow.

300
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,940
How are you?

301
00:15:22,974 --> 00:15:24,944
Fine.

302
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,307
Though...

303
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,623
I think I've put
on a little weight.

304
00:15:31,659 --> 00:15:33,356
You carry it well.

305
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:40,636
You know, what...
what you're doing for me

306
00:15:40,677 --> 00:15:42,840
and for us, I...

307
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,852
I don't know how to thank you.

308
00:15:45,887 --> 00:15:47,355
Oh.

309
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,221
Keiko...

310
00:15:52,266 --> 00:15:54,600
this is your baby.

311
00:16:01,317 --> 00:16:03,048
That will pay off Moogie

312
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:04,853
leaving 196 bars of latinum

313
00:16:04,891 --> 00:16:08,193
to pay off Uncle Gorad
and Cousin Gaila.

314
00:16:10,068 --> 00:16:11,331
Is that clear?

315
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:12,703
I think so.

316
00:16:12,741 --> 00:16:14,677
Good. Now,
on to my funeral arrangements.

317
00:16:14,711 --> 00:16:15,679
First...

318
00:16:15,713 --> 00:16:16,942
Quark?

319
00:16:16,982 --> 00:16:20,045
I want my eulogy
to take place in the holosuite.

320
00:16:20,088 --> 00:16:21,648
We'll charge admission...

321
00:16:21,692 --> 00:16:23,024
two slips a head.

322
00:16:23,061 --> 00:16:25,031
I don't know about that.

323
00:16:25,065 --> 00:16:26,363
You're right.

324
00:16:26,401 --> 00:16:27,927
Make it three.

325
00:16:27,971 --> 00:16:28,939
Quark.

326
00:16:28,973 --> 00:16:30,464
Huh?

327
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:35,008
I just received an odd message
from a Dr. Orpax of Ferenginar.

328
00:16:35,052 --> 00:16:36,851
He wanted me to tell you
that he's very sorry

329
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:38,289
but you don't have
Dorek syndrome.

330
00:16:38,324 --> 00:16:40,317
Does that make any sense to you?

331
00:16:40,362 --> 00:16:42,195
You don't have Dorek syndrome?

332
00:16:42,232 --> 00:16:44,031
Do you know what that means,
Rom?

333
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,302
It means you're going to live!

334
00:16:48,144 --> 00:16:53,451
It means I get to sue Dr. Orpax
for malpractice!

335
00:16:56,394 --> 00:16:58,489
And I'm going to live.

336
00:17:08,017 --> 00:17:09,816
I'm coming.

337
00:17:10,857 --> 00:17:12,383
I'm coming.

338
00:17:12,426 --> 00:17:14,692
I-I-I'm coming!

339
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:19,769
Computer, lights.

340
00:17:23,783 --> 00:17:25,115
Come in already.

341
00:17:29,293 --> 00:17:32,060
Brunt, FCA.

342
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:34,331
Don't tell me
this is a surprise audit.

343
00:17:35,505 --> 00:17:37,372
Not this time.

344
00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:40,745
I'm here to...

345
00:17:40,783 --> 00:17:42,548
check on my merchandise.

346
00:17:42,587 --> 00:17:44,147
What are you talking about?

347
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,784
I'm talking about you.

348
00:17:45,827 --> 00:17:47,763
I paid 500 bars of latinum

349
00:17:47,797 --> 00:17:49,790
for your desiccated remains

350
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,805
and I'm here to collect.

351
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:53,809
You're the anonymous buyer?

352
00:17:53,843 --> 00:17:55,642
Well, who did you expect?

353
00:17:55,746 --> 00:17:58,148
- The Nagus?
- The Nagus?

354
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,620
Of course not.

355
00:18:01,658 --> 00:18:04,094
I'm just a little surprised
it was you.

356
00:18:04,129 --> 00:18:06,326
I guess you haven't
heard the news.

357
00:18:06,367 --> 00:18:08,564
You mean that you
don't have Dorek syndrome?

358
00:18:08,606 --> 00:18:09,665
I know all about it.

359
00:18:11,143 --> 00:18:12,840
But, uh, I don't understand.

360
00:18:12,881 --> 00:18:14,544
What are you doing here?

361
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:17,111
I'm here to get what I paid for.

362
00:18:17,155 --> 00:18:20,925
The contract calls for 52 disks
of vacuum-desiccated Quark

363
00:18:20,963 --> 00:18:22,796
available within six days.

364
00:18:22,834 --> 00:18:25,601
I'm here to make sure
you deliver

365
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,271
the merchandise.

366
00:18:36,294 --> 00:18:37,991
Maybe I wasn't clear.

367
00:18:38,031 --> 00:18:39,660
I'm not dying.

368
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,568
Maybe I wasn't clear.

369
00:18:41,604 --> 00:18:43,198
I don't care.

370
00:18:43,241 --> 00:18:44,972
I want...

371
00:18:45,011 --> 00:18:47,174
my merchandise.

372
00:18:47,215 --> 00:18:53,683
I have a thousand ideas
of how to defile your remains.

373
00:18:53,729 --> 00:18:55,562
Want to hear my favorites?

374
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:58,700
I see.

375
00:18:58,739 --> 00:19:00,402
How foolish of me.

376
00:19:00,442 --> 00:19:02,674
I forgot to mention
that on top of your full refund

377
00:19:02,714 --> 00:19:06,381
you'll also be receiving an
additional five bars of latinum

378
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,911
for your troubles.

379
00:19:10,061 --> 00:19:12,088
Did I say five?
I meant ten.

380
00:19:12,132 --> 00:19:14,364
You drive a hard bargain.

381
00:19:15,605 --> 00:19:18,805
12... that's my final offer.

382
00:19:23,654 --> 00:19:25,817
Look, it's late,
you've come a long way.

383
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,021
Why don't we stop this haggling

384
00:19:27,062 --> 00:19:28,553
and you just tell me
how much you want?

385
00:19:28,598 --> 00:19:31,161
What I want...

386
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:35,303
is 52 disks
of vacuum-desiccated Quark...

387
00:19:35,345 --> 00:19:37,315
nothing more

388
00:19:37,349 --> 00:19:38,647
nothing less.

389
00:19:38,685 --> 00:19:41,680
But I'm not going
to die just yet!

390
00:19:50,241 --> 00:19:52,108
What do you expect me to do?

391
00:19:52,145 --> 00:19:54,878
Kill myself?

392
00:19:56,087 --> 00:19:58,557
Of course not.

393
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,720
You can have someone
do it for you.

394
00:20:00,763 --> 00:20:02,197
I recommend strangulation...

395
00:20:02,232 --> 00:20:04,168
leaves the body
relatively unmarked

396
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,171
for desiccation.

397
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:06,571
You can't be serious.

398
00:20:06,607 --> 00:20:08,702
A contract is a contract...

399
00:20:08,745 --> 00:20:10,111
Is a contract.

400
00:20:10,148 --> 00:20:11,947
I know that.

401
00:20:11,985 --> 00:20:14,080
But you don't collect
on contracts

402
00:20:14,123 --> 00:20:15,786
under these circumstances.

403
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:23,899
We're not Klingons.

404
00:20:23,942 --> 00:20:25,468
We're businessmen.

405
00:20:25,512 --> 00:20:27,243
This is not business.

406
00:20:27,282 --> 00:20:29,479
Quark...

407
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,513
this is personal.

408
00:20:31,557 --> 00:20:33,288
But why?

409
00:20:33,327 --> 00:20:35,820
What have I ever done to you?

410
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:37,459
Done to me?

411
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:40,838
And you call your brother
an idiot?

412
00:20:40,943 --> 00:20:44,474
Nothing you have
ever done to me

413
00:20:44,516 --> 00:20:47,818
has been more than
a minor inconvenience, no.

414
00:20:47,857 --> 00:20:50,727
Protecting your mother
from an FCA audit

415
00:20:50,763 --> 00:20:54,498
and secretly settling
with your striking employees

416
00:20:54,536 --> 00:20:57,667
were nothing more than symptoms

417
00:20:57,709 --> 00:21:00,977
of a vile
and insidious weakness...

418
00:21:01,016 --> 00:21:04,956
a weakness
that makes me loath you...

419
00:21:04,991 --> 00:21:06,551
not for what you've done

420
00:21:06,594 --> 00:21:09,327
but for who you are,
what you are.

421
00:21:09,366 --> 00:21:11,029
A bartender?

422
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,837
A philanthropist.

423
00:21:13,942 --> 00:21:16,003
I am not.

424
00:21:16,046 --> 00:21:18,574
You give your customers
credit at the bar!

425
00:21:18,618 --> 00:21:20,850
You only take
a 30 percent kickback

426
00:21:20,889 --> 00:21:22,289
from your employees' tips

427
00:21:22,325 --> 00:21:25,058
and you sold food and
medicine to Bajoran refugees

428
00:21:25,098 --> 00:21:26,327
at cost!

429
00:21:26,367 --> 00:21:28,496
That's not true.

430
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,100
It was just above cost.

431
00:21:31,143 --> 00:21:32,338
Close enough.

432
00:21:32,379 --> 00:21:36,877
It was still a generous
humanitarian gesture.

433
00:21:36,988 --> 00:21:38,081
You've gone Starfleet.

434
00:21:38,124 --> 00:21:40,185
You might as well be wearing
one of their uniforms.

435
00:21:40,228 --> 00:21:41,526
It's people like you

436
00:21:41,563 --> 00:21:44,763
that give honest Ferengi
businessmen a bad name.

437
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,066
I can reform.

438
00:21:46,106 --> 00:21:48,201
I'll start gouging
the customers again.

439
00:21:48,244 --> 00:21:51,239
I'll revoke all
my employees' vacation time.

440
00:21:51,283 --> 00:21:54,517
You gave them vacations?

441
00:21:54,556 --> 00:21:56,788
I didn't give them anything.

442
00:21:56,828 --> 00:21:59,561
They contributed
to a central fund

443
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:01,033
which I manage...

444
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,038
You...

445
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:05,187
disgust me.

446
00:22:06,522 --> 00:22:07,512
Look!

447
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:11,899
I understand your anger.

448
00:22:11,934 --> 00:22:14,531
You're absolutely
right about me

449
00:22:14,572 --> 00:22:19,139
but there must be some
accommodation we can make...

450
00:22:19,181 --> 00:22:22,017
something other than
me killing myself.

451
00:22:22,054 --> 00:22:23,249
Of course, there is.

452
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:25,921
You can break the contract.

453
00:22:25,962 --> 00:22:29,059
Me... break a Ferengi contract?
Never.

454
00:22:29,101 --> 00:22:30,069
Never?

455
00:22:30,103 --> 00:22:31,071
Uh-uh.

456
00:22:31,105 --> 00:22:32,130
I wonder if there's

457
00:22:32,174 --> 00:22:34,737
enough Ferengi left in you
to stick to that.

458
00:22:34,779 --> 00:22:37,649
Part of me hopes you will
break it, because then

459
00:22:37,685 --> 00:22:39,951
everything you and your
family own on Ferenginar

460
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:43,190
will be confiscated
and sold to the lowest bidder.

461
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:44,322
Your mother will be forced

462
00:22:44,365 --> 00:22:46,699
to live on the streets,
begging for scraps of food

463
00:22:46,736 --> 00:22:49,606
and, of course, no Ferengi
will do business with you

464
00:22:49,642 --> 00:22:51,008
or even talk to you.

465
00:22:51,045 --> 00:22:54,347
You'll be cut off from all
contact with your own people.

466
00:22:56,222 --> 00:22:58,385
I like Ferengi.

467
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,231
I-I feel comfortable
around them.

468
00:23:02,267 --> 00:23:05,728
Well, we don't feel
comfortable around you.

469
00:23:05,774 --> 00:23:08,244
You're a disease, Quark

470
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:12,777
a festering tumor
on the lobes of Ferengi society

471
00:23:12,821 --> 00:23:15,691
and it's my job to cut you off.

472
00:23:26,048 --> 00:23:28,177
One step at a time.

473
00:23:29,956 --> 00:23:31,858
Yeah...

474
00:23:31,893 --> 00:23:33,726
we're almost there.

475
00:23:36,068 --> 00:23:38,197
Prepare for docking.

476
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:40,539
Thrusters back to half.

477
00:23:40,577 --> 00:23:42,274
Yes.

478
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,050
Nice landing, Captain.

479
00:23:46,088 --> 00:23:49,060
Let me know when you want
to get underway again.

480
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,927
I think I'll stay here a week.

481
00:23:56,442 --> 00:23:58,435
Did you see Kira today?

482
00:23:58,546 --> 00:23:59,980
Yeah.

483
00:24:00,016 --> 00:24:01,645
I saw her in Ops.

484
00:24:01,686 --> 00:24:05,056
I was thinking about
inviting her to dinner.

485
00:24:05,093 --> 00:24:09,363
Good idea. Maybe she could
come by every evening.

486
00:24:11,906 --> 00:24:15,869
Even if she came by every
evening, it wouldn't be enough.

487
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:18,545
I know I'm being selfish.

488
00:24:18,586 --> 00:24:22,754
I should be grateful
that my baby's alive and well.

489
00:24:25,433 --> 00:24:27,903
But I shouldn't have
to make appointments

490
00:24:27,938 --> 00:24:30,101
to be with my own child.

491
00:24:34,118 --> 00:24:36,681
Miles, what are we going to do?

492
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:41,831
I don't know.

493
00:24:52,287 --> 00:24:54,280
I know what you're thinking,
Brother...

494
00:24:54,325 --> 00:24:56,853
that you can't break
a sacred Ferengi tradition.

495
00:24:56,896 --> 00:25:00,232
But the truth is defying
Ferengi tradition isn't so bad.

496
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,830
I did it...
I formed a union.

497
00:25:01,872 --> 00:25:03,306
Everyone said I was crazy

498
00:25:03,343 --> 00:25:06,213
that no Ferengi would have
anything to do with me.

499
00:25:06,248 --> 00:25:08,150
They didn't want
anything to do with you

500
00:25:08,186 --> 00:25:09,620
before you formed the union.

501
00:25:09,655 --> 00:25:12,354
If you try the trousers on first

502
00:25:12,394 --> 00:25:15,195
you'll see I've added
some extra padding to the seat

503
00:25:15,233 --> 00:25:18,467
which should make swiveling
on your barstool

504
00:25:18,506 --> 00:25:20,237
much more comfortable.

505
00:25:24,518 --> 00:25:28,686
I'm afraid your pants won't be
ready until next week, Quark.

506
00:25:28,726 --> 00:25:30,194
That's not why I'm here.

507
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:32,861
Ah! And what can I do for you?

508
00:25:32,901 --> 00:25:36,432
I want to hire you,
not as a tailor...

509
00:25:36,475 --> 00:25:38,570
as an assassin.

510
00:25:41,352 --> 00:25:43,618
I don't know
what you're talking about.

511
00:25:43,656 --> 00:25:45,853
Oh, yes, you do.

512
00:25:45,894 --> 00:25:48,194
You weren't always a tailor.

513
00:25:48,232 --> 00:25:49,495
You're right.

514
00:25:49,535 --> 00:25:51,505
I used to be a gardener.

515
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:55,206
Now, if you have something you
want weeded, you let me know.

516
00:25:55,246 --> 00:25:58,241
Not something...

517
00:25:58,286 --> 00:25:59,983
someone.

518
00:26:01,358 --> 00:26:03,487
You're going to have
Brunt killed.

519
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:06,399
I didn't think
you had it in you, Brother.

520
00:26:06,435 --> 00:26:09,271
What a bold,
uncompromising move.

521
00:26:09,308 --> 00:26:11,175
Would you be quiet?

522
00:26:12,681 --> 00:26:15,983
I don't want you to kill Brunt.

523
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,956
I want you to kill me.

524
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:35,017
You want me to kill you.

525
00:26:35,058 --> 00:26:37,757
Well, that's different.

526
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:39,859
Something swift and painless

527
00:26:39,902 --> 00:26:41,804
and preferably bloodless...

528
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:44,811
though I imagine
that's not always possible.

529
00:26:44,845 --> 00:26:46,006
Wait a minute!

530
00:26:46,047 --> 00:26:47,573
You can't do this.

531
00:26:47,684 --> 00:26:49,586
I thought you were going
to break the contract.

532
00:26:49,655 --> 00:26:51,454
What are
the key words there?

533
00:26:51,492 --> 00:26:52,460
You thought.

534
00:26:52,494 --> 00:26:53,462
But, Brother...

535
00:26:53,496 --> 00:26:55,932
Don't "Brother" me, Rom.

536
00:26:55,967 --> 00:26:58,028
I'm not like you or Nog
or Moogie

537
00:26:58,071 --> 00:27:00,007
or the rest
of our pathetic family.

538
00:27:00,042 --> 00:27:03,607
I'm a Ferengi businessman.

539
00:27:05,052 --> 00:27:07,284
And I made a contract.

540
00:27:07,324 --> 00:27:10,353
And a contract
is a contract is...

541
00:27:10,396 --> 00:27:13,061
Don't quote
Rules of Acquisition to me!

542
00:27:13,101 --> 00:27:15,298
This is your life
we're talking about!

543
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,501
That's right.

544
00:27:16,542 --> 00:27:18,239
My life!

545
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:19,942
What's the most important
thing in my life?

546
00:27:19,982 --> 00:27:21,611
Business.

547
00:27:22,921 --> 00:27:24,321
That's who I am.

548
00:27:24,358 --> 00:27:25,987
That's what I do.

549
00:27:26,027 --> 00:27:27,758
I'm a businessman.

550
00:27:27,797 --> 00:27:31,567
And more than that,
I'm a Ferengi businessman.

551
00:27:31,605 --> 00:27:33,598
Do you know what that means?

552
00:27:33,709 --> 00:27:37,410
It means that I'm not exploiting
and cheating people at random.

553
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:42,188
I'm doing it according
to a specific set of rules.

554
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:46,366
The Rules of Acquisition.

555
00:27:46,402 --> 00:27:49,636
And I won't disregard them
when I find them inconvenient.

556
00:27:49,741 --> 00:27:51,643
Inconvenient?

557
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,149
You're going to die!

558
00:27:57,022 --> 00:27:59,356
Yes.

559
00:27:59,394 --> 00:28:02,764
And when I arrive at the gates
of the Divine Treasury

560
00:28:02,801 --> 00:28:07,071
the Registrar will accept
my bribe and usher me inside

561
00:28:07,109 --> 00:28:08,840
and do you know why?

562
00:28:08,879 --> 00:28:14,220
Because I died
exactly the way I lived...

563
00:28:14,257 --> 00:28:15,920
as a Ferengi!

564
00:28:19,501 --> 00:28:22,439
Garak, let's talk about death.

565
00:28:30,356 --> 00:28:31,654
He's kicking so hard.

566
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:33,490
Do you think he's all right?

567
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:34,997
Oh, it's a good sign.

568
00:28:35,032 --> 00:28:37,468
Molly...
I thought she was going

569
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,736
to kick her way out of me.

570
00:28:41,578 --> 00:28:43,069
Lower back, huh?

571
00:28:44,384 --> 00:28:46,718
Hold on.
I have just the thing.

572
00:28:48,592 --> 00:28:51,792
It was so thoughtful of you
to share this with us.

573
00:28:51,832 --> 00:28:53,300
Thank you, Major.

574
00:28:53,335 --> 00:28:56,637
Please... Nerys.

575
00:28:56,675 --> 00:28:59,408
So, um, any morning sickness?

576
00:28:59,448 --> 00:29:00,814
What's that?

577
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:03,879
Well, I don't know
how it is for Bajorans

578
00:29:03,923 --> 00:29:07,590
but, typically, human mothers
wake up feeling nauseous.

579
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:10,431
Well, it doesn't work
that way for Bajorans.

580
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:13,567
Typically, we start
sneezing... uncontrollably.

581
00:29:13,609 --> 00:29:15,670
But this is a human baby.

582
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,080
I don't know what to expect.

583
00:29:18,118 --> 00:29:20,179
Here you go.

584
00:29:20,222 --> 00:29:21,451
Oh...

585
00:29:21,492 --> 00:29:23,121
Slide that in there.

586
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:24,790
Get this side...
Sorry.

587
00:29:24,831 --> 00:29:25,924
Better?

588
00:29:25,967 --> 00:29:26,935
I'm hungry.

589
00:29:26,969 --> 00:29:28,028
Oh, much.

590
00:29:28,071 --> 00:29:29,198
Put your feet up.

591
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,503
Oh, no, no, that's fine.

592
00:29:30,543 --> 00:29:31,841
It is about that time.

593
00:29:31,879 --> 00:29:33,245
I'll get dinner started.

594
00:29:33,282 --> 00:29:35,377
I should be going
back to my quarters.

595
00:29:35,419 --> 00:29:37,548
Why? Have dinner with us.

596
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:39,219
I don't want to impose.

597
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,253
Nerys, you're having
our baby.

598
00:29:41,298 --> 00:29:42,732
You're family now.

599
00:29:42,767 --> 00:29:43,962
That's right.

600
00:29:44,003 --> 00:29:47,305
In fact, Keiko and I have been
talking about something.

601
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:51,708
Well, we have an idea
that we'd like you to consider.

602
00:29:51,752 --> 00:29:52,742
It's just an idea.

603
00:29:52,854 --> 00:29:54,949
We don't want to pressure you.

604
00:29:54,991 --> 00:29:56,220
I understand.
What is it?

605
00:29:58,632 --> 00:29:59,565
Go ahead.

606
00:30:06,815 --> 00:30:09,810
Mmm... mmm!

607
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,256
Ooh.

608
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:14,989
Mmm.

609
00:30:26,955 --> 00:30:28,253
How's that?

610
00:30:33,034 --> 00:30:34,697
Awful!

611
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,501
Did you hear that sound
of bone snapping?

612
00:30:39,548 --> 00:30:41,916
I don't want that to be
the last thing I hear.

613
00:30:41,952 --> 00:30:44,719
It wasn't that loud.

614
00:30:44,758 --> 00:30:46,284
You don't have these ears.

615
00:30:46,327 --> 00:30:48,524
Snapping vertebrae is out.

616
00:30:48,566 --> 00:30:51,036
We're running
out of options, Quark.

617
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:53,540
You don't want to be vaporized
because you need a body.

618
00:30:53,609 --> 00:30:54,872
The disrupter ruined

619
00:30:54,911 --> 00:30:57,815
your clothing,
the knife was too savage

620
00:30:57,851 --> 00:30:59,514
the nerve gas smelled bad

621
00:30:59,554 --> 00:31:01,547
hanging took too long
and poison...

622
00:31:01,658 --> 00:31:03,355
What was wrong with poison?

623
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:04,693
It doesn't work!

624
00:31:04,731 --> 00:31:07,201
If I know the food is
poisoned, I won't eat it.

625
00:31:07,236 --> 00:31:08,670
Could you get rid of this?

626
00:31:08,706 --> 00:31:10,676
The sight of it
is making me sick.

627
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,339
Computer, remove corpse.

628
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,509
For a man who wants
to kill himself

629
00:31:14,551 --> 00:31:16,987
you are strangely
determined to live.

630
00:31:17,022 --> 00:31:18,821
I'm going to die...
don't you worry about that.

631
00:31:18,859 --> 00:31:20,191
I just want to find
the right way.

632
00:31:20,228 --> 00:31:21,196
Right way?

633
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:23,257
I don't want to see it coming

634
00:31:23,301 --> 00:31:26,535
or hear it or feel it
or smell it.

635
00:31:26,575 --> 00:31:29,911
I just want to go on with
my life and then... I'm dead.

636
00:31:29,948 --> 00:31:30,916
Ah.

637
00:31:31,952 --> 00:31:34,047
You want to be surprised.

638
00:31:34,089 --> 00:31:36,720
Exactly. I want to wake up
in the Divine Treasury

639
00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:38,789
and have no idea
how I got there.

640
00:31:38,832 --> 00:31:40,232
I see.

641
00:31:40,268 --> 00:31:44,003
Perhaps that can be arranged.

642
00:31:44,043 --> 00:31:45,477
Really.

643
00:31:45,513 --> 00:31:48,246
You have my word.

644
00:31:48,284 --> 00:31:52,122
You'll never know
what hit you.

645
00:32:16,107 --> 00:32:18,738
Computer?

646
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:19,872
Lights.

647
00:32:26,962 --> 00:32:29,593
Garak, if you're in here...

648
00:32:29,634 --> 00:32:32,104
I'm not going to be surprised!

649
00:32:58,992 --> 00:33:01,224
Where am I?

650
00:33:03,902 --> 00:33:06,065
"Please have your profit
and loss statement

651
00:33:06,107 --> 00:33:08,373
"ready for inspection...

652
00:33:09,681 --> 00:33:12,244
before entering
the Divine Treasury."

653
00:33:14,657 --> 00:33:16,183
I'm dead.

654
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:21,394
Garak, you're good.

655
00:33:31,858 --> 00:33:34,226
I'm really dead.

656
00:33:35,331 --> 00:33:37,358
You're not just dead, Quark...

657
00:33:38,605 --> 00:33:40,039
you're an idiot!

658
00:33:41,143 --> 00:33:43,204
Who... are you?

659
00:33:43,247 --> 00:33:46,880
I am Gint,
the first Grand Nagus.

660
00:33:46,922 --> 00:33:49,826
You look like...

661
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,024
like my brother Rom.

662
00:33:52,065 --> 00:33:55,504
That's because this is
a dream, you imbecile.

663
00:33:55,539 --> 00:33:57,236
So...

664
00:33:57,275 --> 00:33:58,709
I'm not dead.

665
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,544
What a clever boy...

666
00:34:00,583 --> 00:34:01,846
always thinking.

667
00:34:01,885 --> 00:34:03,046
I'm asleep.

668
00:34:03,087 --> 00:34:06,652
That explains why this place
looks so tacky.

669
00:34:06,695 --> 00:34:09,997
I mean, the Divine Treasury...

670
00:34:10,034 --> 00:34:11,833
please.

671
00:34:11,872 --> 00:34:14,503
Don't blame me
for your limited imagination.

672
00:34:14,543 --> 00:34:17,276
Now, I'll make it simple.

673
00:34:17,315 --> 00:34:20,549
You have to break
the contract with Brunt.

674
00:34:22,525 --> 00:34:24,495
You got to be joking.

675
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:26,089
You're Gint.

676
00:34:26,133 --> 00:34:28,296
You wrote
<i>The Rules of Acquisition...</i>

677
00:34:28,337 --> 00:34:32,107
the scared precepts upon which
all Ferengi society is based.

678
00:34:32,145 --> 00:34:35,606
Oh, you of all people
can't expect me to break them.

679
00:34:35,653 --> 00:34:38,625
Why not?
They're just rules.

680
00:34:40,395 --> 00:34:42,058
They're written in a book

681
00:34:42,098 --> 00:34:44,034
not carved in stone.

682
00:34:44,069 --> 00:34:46,939
And even if they were in stone,
so what?

683
00:34:46,975 --> 00:34:49,343
A bunch of us just made them up.

684
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:51,349
Are you saying
they don't matter?

685
00:34:51,383 --> 00:34:52,749
Of course, they matter.

686
00:34:52,853 --> 00:34:54,755
That's why
they're a best seller.

687
00:34:54,824 --> 00:34:57,226
But we're talking
about your life here.

688
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:59,732
The Rules are nothing
but guideposts...

689
00:34:59,767 --> 00:35:00,962
suggestions.

690
00:35:01,003 --> 00:35:03,200
Then why call them "Rules"?

691
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,907
Would you buy a book called
<i>Suggestions of Acquisition?</i>

692
00:35:06,948 --> 00:35:09,715
Doesn't quite have
the same ring to it, does it?

693
00:35:09,787 --> 00:35:11,654
You mean it was
a marketing ploy?

694
00:35:11,691 --> 00:35:13,490
Shh!

695
00:35:14,731 --> 00:35:16,199
A brilliant one.

696
00:35:16,233 --> 00:35:19,069
Rule of Acquisition 239:

697
00:35:19,106 --> 00:35:22,545
"Never be afraid
to mislabel a product."

698
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:26,485
I've based my entire life
around these Rules.

699
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,048
How can I just walk
away from them?

700
00:35:30,395 --> 00:35:33,561
Because I'm telling you to.

701
00:35:33,601 --> 00:35:35,594
But you can't do that.

702
00:35:36,808 --> 00:35:38,208
You're not Gint.

703
00:35:38,244 --> 00:35:40,909
This is just a dream.

704
00:35:40,949 --> 00:35:42,417
Exactly.

705
00:35:42,452 --> 00:35:44,081
And I wouldn't be here

706
00:35:44,122 --> 00:35:46,319
if you didn't want
to break the Rules.

707
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,523
You just need
someone's permission.

708
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:51,229
So I'm giving it to you.

709
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,399
I suppose...

710
00:35:53,441 --> 00:35:56,470
if the First Nagus Gint

711
00:35:56,513 --> 00:35:59,076
came to me in a vision

712
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,580
and told me
to break the Rules...

713
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:06,328
that would be all right.

714
00:36:06,366 --> 00:36:07,800
Quark, hold it right there!

715
00:36:08,805 --> 00:36:10,741
Brunt, FCA.

716
00:36:10,776 --> 00:36:12,210
What are you doing here?

717
00:36:12,245 --> 00:36:13,771
This is a private vision.

718
00:36:13,815 --> 00:36:15,249
I'm here to remind you

719
00:36:15,284 --> 00:36:17,881
of the consequences
of disregarding the Rules...

720
00:36:17,923 --> 00:36:19,050
poverty, destitution

721
00:36:19,092 --> 00:36:20,789
exile.

722
00:36:20,863 --> 00:36:22,389
I know.
I know, but look!

723
00:36:22,432 --> 00:36:25,427
Gint himself has come
to me in a vision.

724
00:36:25,471 --> 00:36:28,341
He's telling me
to break the contract.

725
00:36:28,377 --> 00:36:29,709
That is not Gint.

726
00:36:29,747 --> 00:36:30,806
Gint was a lot taller.

727
00:36:30,916 --> 00:36:33,216
You listen to that fraud,
you'll regret it

728
00:36:33,254 --> 00:36:34,814
for the rest
of your miserable life.

729
00:36:34,924 --> 00:36:38,659
I say we kill him right now.

730
00:36:38,698 --> 00:36:40,327
This is a dream.

731
00:36:40,368 --> 00:36:42,736
You can't kill me.

732
00:36:42,773 --> 00:36:44,834
However...

733
00:36:44,877 --> 00:36:49,785
people have been known
to die in their sleep.

734
00:36:50,789 --> 00:36:52,986
Come on!

735
00:36:53,027 --> 00:36:54,188
Rom!

736
00:36:54,229 --> 00:36:55,823
Gint... whatever your name is!

737
00:36:55,866 --> 00:36:57,129
Help me.

738
00:36:57,168 --> 00:36:58,363
He's got a point, Quark.

739
00:36:58,404 --> 00:36:59,394
It's a dream.

740
00:36:59,439 --> 00:37:01,841
I can't really do anything.

741
00:37:01,878 --> 00:37:05,373
But if you want to live,
break the contract.

742
00:37:05,418 --> 00:37:07,285
It's your only hope.

743
00:37:14,002 --> 00:37:15,904
I'm alive.

744
00:37:17,981 --> 00:37:19,746
I find it surprising

745
00:37:19,785 --> 00:37:24,055
that someone with such long,
slender and nimble fingers

746
00:37:24,093 --> 00:37:28,124
has never practiced <i>oo-mox.</i>

747
00:37:29,939 --> 00:37:32,239
Come to beg for your life?

748
00:37:35,817 --> 00:37:37,753
What is this?

749
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:40,088
I am returning
your 500 bars of latinum

750
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:41,388
plus interest.

751
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:45,334
I told you I wasn't
interested in a refund.

752
00:37:45,369 --> 00:37:46,359
I know.

753
00:37:47,573 --> 00:37:49,736
I'm breaking the contract.

754
00:37:52,683 --> 00:37:54,117
I knew it.

755
00:37:54,153 --> 00:37:56,989
You're just like
the rest of your family...

756
00:37:57,026 --> 00:37:59,691
weak-lobed degenerates...

757
00:37:59,731 --> 00:38:01,826
another loser

758
00:38:01,869 --> 00:38:05,900
in a long line
of failed Ferengis.

759
00:38:05,944 --> 00:38:07,470
Look, I've broken the contract

760
00:38:07,513 --> 00:38:09,039
so do your job...

761
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:12,249
take my assets, revoke
my Ferengi business license.

762
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:15,854
Do whatever you have to do,
then get out.

763
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:21,034
And if I ever see you
walk into my bar again...

764
00:38:21,074 --> 00:38:23,067
Yes?

765
00:38:23,111 --> 00:38:26,015
You won't walk out.

766
00:38:28,288 --> 00:38:32,092
May I have your attention,
please?!

767
00:38:33,799 --> 00:38:38,137
Brunt, FCA.

768
00:38:38,241 --> 00:38:41,908
As of this moment,
no further Ferengi commerce

769
00:38:41,949 --> 00:38:43,885
may be conducted in this bar.

770
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,051
No Ferengi may be
employed by this bar

771
00:38:47,093 --> 00:38:49,563
no Ferengi may eat or drink
in this bar

772
00:38:49,597 --> 00:38:52,728
and no Ferengi...

773
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:54,364
no Ferengi!...

774
00:38:54,407 --> 00:38:58,006
may do business with that man!

775
00:39:03,625 --> 00:39:08,932
Confiscation of assets
will begin immediately.

776
00:39:11,741 --> 00:39:14,041
Ladies and gentlemen...

777
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:17,645
this bar is closed
until further notice.

778
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:21,959
Thank you for your patronage.

779
00:39:49,417 --> 00:39:50,908
Come in.

780
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:54,485
I'll take that, Major... Nerys.

781
00:39:54,527 --> 00:39:56,018
Is this it?

782
00:39:56,064 --> 00:39:57,464
Oh, I travel light.

783
00:39:57,499 --> 00:39:59,230
Would you like to see your room?

784
00:39:59,303 --> 00:40:00,396
Sure.

785
00:40:12,529 --> 00:40:14,522
Welcome to your new home.

786
00:40:14,567 --> 00:40:17,869
At least until the baby is born.

787
00:40:17,906 --> 00:40:19,466
Are you my aunt?

788
00:40:21,714 --> 00:40:22,875
Well...

789
00:40:24,186 --> 00:40:25,780
Sounds right to me.

790
00:40:29,597 --> 00:40:31,567
Aunt Nerys.

791
00:40:31,601 --> 00:40:33,833
Aunt Nerys,
can I play in your room?

792
00:40:33,872 --> 00:40:36,365
Anytime you want.

793
00:41:08,408 --> 00:41:10,105
How are you, Brother?

794
00:41:10,145 --> 00:41:11,306
How am I?

795
00:41:11,347 --> 00:41:13,283
I'm broke...

796
00:41:13,318 --> 00:41:14,445
ruined...

797
00:41:14,487 --> 00:41:16,821
destitute...

798
00:41:16,858 --> 00:41:17,826
a pariah.

799
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,192
How are things with you?

800
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,255
Not bad.

801
00:41:20,298 --> 00:41:21,995
Glad to hear it.

802
00:41:31,721 --> 00:41:33,588
They took everything?

803
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:35,059
Mm-hmm.

804
00:41:35,095 --> 00:41:37,361
Including this shirt.

805
00:41:37,433 --> 00:41:41,066
I'm supposed to send it to Brunt
in the morning.

806
00:41:41,107 --> 00:41:42,507
Don't worry.

807
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:45,379
I have some old clothes
I was going to throw out.

808
00:41:45,482 --> 00:41:46,711
Hmph.

809
00:41:46,751 --> 00:41:48,846
I'd rather be naked.

810
00:41:48,888 --> 00:41:50,653
Okay.

811
00:41:51,961 --> 00:41:55,365
Brother, the way
you stood up to Brunt...

812
00:41:56,904 --> 00:42:00,776
Well, I want you to know
that I'm very proud of you.

813
00:42:00,812 --> 00:42:03,248
Well, then...

814
00:42:03,284 --> 00:42:06,849
I guess throwing my entire
life away was worth it.

815
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:08,861
I wouldn't go that far.

816
00:42:08,895 --> 00:42:10,056
Mmm.

817
00:42:13,271 --> 00:42:15,764
So, what are you going
to do now?

818
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:18,605
Well, Rom...

819
00:42:19,917 --> 00:42:22,480
I've been thinking long and hard

820
00:42:22,523 --> 00:42:24,014
and you know what?

821
00:42:25,529 --> 00:42:27,795
I don't have a clue.

822
00:42:27,833 --> 00:42:30,634
Quark, where do you want this?

823
00:42:30,672 --> 00:42:31,731
What is it?

824
00:42:31,774 --> 00:42:34,142
A case of Alvanian brandy.

825
00:42:34,179 --> 00:42:37,710
A patient sent it as payment,
but I can't accept it.

826
00:42:37,753 --> 00:42:38,880
Nice try, Doctor

827
00:42:38,922 --> 00:42:40,789
but I don't want your charity.

828
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:43,125
Oh, it's not charity.
I find it undrinkable.

829
00:42:43,164 --> 00:42:45,225
So, do you want it
or shall I dump it?

830
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:50,870
Quark, my sister sent me these.

831
00:42:50,912 --> 00:42:52,438
I thought you might want them.

832
00:42:52,482 --> 00:42:54,384
But they're really ugly.

833
00:42:57,659 --> 00:43:00,027
They're not as ugly
as the old ones

834
00:43:00,064 --> 00:43:01,464
but they're pretty bad.

835
00:43:01,534 --> 00:43:03,094
This is all very amusing

836
00:43:03,137 --> 00:43:05,665
but I can't start a bar
with a case of bad brandy

837
00:43:05,709 --> 00:43:07,235
and a set of...

838
00:43:07,279 --> 00:43:09,944
ugly glasses.

839
00:43:09,984 --> 00:43:11,384
Quark.

840
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:13,652
Yes, Captain?

841
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:15,159
We're doing
some structural repair

842
00:43:15,195 --> 00:43:16,527
on Level 2 of the Habitat Ring.

843
00:43:16,564 --> 00:43:18,557
We need a place to store
some extra furniture

844
00:43:18,601 --> 00:43:19,626
for the next few months

845
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:21,299
and it looks like
you have the room.

846
00:43:25,749 --> 00:43:27,878
Captain, where do
you want me to put

847
00:43:27,919 --> 00:43:29,285
all this furniture?

848
00:43:29,323 --> 00:43:31,225
We have three levels,
Constable, use them all.

849
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,250
Understood.

850
00:43:32,295 --> 00:43:34,629
Captain, you can't do this!

851
00:43:37,205 --> 00:43:39,802
Not without paying
a storage fee.

852
00:43:41,781 --> 00:43:45,151
A minimum storage fee...
practically nothing.

853
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:47,784
Send me the bill.

854
00:43:49,129 --> 00:43:50,427
All right.

855
00:43:50,465 --> 00:43:52,025
Don't just stand there, Odo.

856
00:43:52,068 --> 00:43:53,297
Move it all in.

857
00:43:53,337 --> 00:43:54,737
Ah!

858
00:44:00,585 --> 00:44:02,179
Look at them, Brother.

859
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:05,456
And you thought
you had no assets.

860
00:44:05,528 --> 00:44:07,555
Sisko, Dax

861
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,694
Bashir, Morn...

862
00:44:09,737 --> 00:44:11,137
they're my assets?

863
00:44:11,173 --> 00:44:12,733
To name a few.

864
00:44:13,678 --> 00:44:14,976
I guess you're right.

865
00:44:15,013 --> 00:44:16,983
Huh.

866
00:44:17,017 --> 00:44:18,680
I need a drink.

867
00:44:21,861 --> 00:44:23,193
Li...
