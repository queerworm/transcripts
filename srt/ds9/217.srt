1
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:11,762
BASHIR:
You know,
if there's anything

2
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:13,012
I can do for you
while you're here...

3
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:14,682
Oh, you've already
been helpful.

4
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,475
Just hearing about
Dax makes me

5
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,268
a little less nervous
about the whole thing.

6
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,312
Really? There's no
reason to be nervous.

7
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:21,856
Jadzia will be
a wonderful host...

8
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:24,191
Well, that is, she<i> is</i>
a wonderful host

9
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,484
in a Trill manner
of speaking.

10
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:26,861
I'm sure you'll learn
a lot from her.

11
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:28,195
She sounds
very different

12
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:30,030
from the other Daxes
I have heard about.

13
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:31,198
In what fashion?

14
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,574
Let me put it this way.

15
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:34,159
When I was told
that Jadzia Dax

16
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:35,744
had been designated
my field docent

17
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:37,746
I asked for
reassignment.

18
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:38,998
You're joking!

19
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,415
Why?

20
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:43,585
Because Dax is famous
for breaking initiates.

21
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:44,753
Breaking them?

22
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:46,463
I looked up
the records.

23
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:48,298
Over the past
200 years

24
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,009
Dax has personally
eliminated

25
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:52,928
57 host candidates
from the program.

26
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:56,056
I suppose it's
too late

27
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,307
to introduce myself to her.

28
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:58,642
Too late? I doubt it.

29
00:00:58,684 --> 00:00:59,977
Jadzia's a night owl.

30
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:02,771
Computer, locate
Lieutenant Dax.

31
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:05,774
Lieutenant Dax is on
Level 7, Section 5.

32
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:07,317
Ah, of course.

33
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:10,029
Then take us to
Level 7, Section 5.

34
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,781
That's the computer's way

35
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,867
of telling us
she's in Quark's.

36
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:19,120
Over 5,000 candidates

37
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:21,999
qualify for the training
program each year.

38
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:23,918
Only 300 symbionts
are available

39
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,210
on the average.

40
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,170
It doesn't take much
for one of us

41
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,214
to get knocked out
of consideration.

42
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,425
The administrators only
want hosts who are...

43
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,593
(<i> shouting</i> )

44
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:33,761
QUARK:
Acquire!

45
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,303
Confront!

46
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:38,348
(<i> cries of dismay</i> )

47
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,184
...the best and
the brightest.

48
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,770
It's the ears!

49
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,772
Every time he
goes to acquire

50
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,608
he scratches behind
his left ear, like this.

51
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,234
Don't play
with my ears...

52
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,946
unless you're
serious about it.

53
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:53,154
Jadzia...

54
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,949
you have
a guest.

55
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,659
Oh, you're not supposed
to be here till tomorrow.

56
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,244
Yes, ma'am.

57
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,371
I caught a transport from
Starbase 41 a day early.

58
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:02,497
We found ourselves
sitting

59
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,999
next to each other
on the way here.

60
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,834
I've been telling
Arjin all about you.

61
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:07,002
Really?

62
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,964
Well, not quite
<i>all</i> about you.

63
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:12,007
Do you play<i> tongo,</i> Arjin?

64
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,759
<i>Tongo?</i>

65
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:14,927
No, sir.

66
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:18,013
Then you'll have
to leave, Arjin.

67
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,848
The risk's to you,
Lieutenant.

68
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:20,933
Shame on you, Quark.

69
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:22,309
Where are your manners?

70
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,227
This is a Trill initiate
you're speaking to.

71
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,187
Of course he doesn't
play<i> tongo.</i>

72
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,107
(<i> sighs</i> )

73
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,817
I beg your pardon.

74
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,777
So, we'll have
to teach him.

75
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:34,071
Actually, it is
very easy to learn.

76
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:36,323
How much money did
you bring with you?

77
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:38,283
Give the young
fellow a seat.

78
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,576
You, out!

79
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:40,995
It was a very
long trip.

80
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:42,955
I think perhaps
I should...

81
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:44,456
Oh, of course,
you're tired.

82
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:45,958
I'll take you
to your quarters.

83
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,126
Roll me away,
fellows.

84
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,669
QUARK: We can't
roll you away.

85
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,087
They're sore losers.

86
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:52,297
QUARK: You can't
quit now. You just won!

87
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:56,384
Female!

88
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:14,148
(<i> door chimes</i> )

89
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,817
Yes?

90
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,777
Oh... I'm sorry.

91
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:22,114
I thought this
was Lieutenant
Dax's quarters.

92
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:24,407
She's in the shower.

93
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,618
Oh... well, uh,
in that case...

94
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,328
Is she expecting you?

95
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,247
Yes, my name is Arjin.

96
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:32,291
She told me I should
be here at 0800...

97
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,708
DAX:
Is that Arjin?

98
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,252
You're early
again, Arjin.

99
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:37,171
We're going to have
to work on that.

100
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,130
I can come back.

101
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:39,589
Don't be silly.
Come in.

102
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,258
I'll only be a minute.

103
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,510
It always takes me longer
to get ready as a female.

104
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,803
I have to go.

105
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,721
I have to be
at Calondia IV
by tomorrow.

106
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,182
When's my rematch?

107
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,017
Oh, I'll be back
next week.

108
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:53,312
It was fun.
Brutal, but fun.

109
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:54,980
Safe trip!

110
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,732
The replicator makes
a decent citrus blend.

111
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,902
Thanks, but I've already
had something to eat.

112
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,737
Would you get me a Black Hole?

113
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,072
A what?

114
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:06,533
A Black Hole--
it's a Ferengi drink.

115
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:10,162
A bartender I've known
for a hundred years

116
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:11,872
introduced it
to Curzon.

117
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,248
Or was it Lela?

118
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,791
Well, it was ages ago.

119
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,543
Try one.
You might like it.

120
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,670
Computer, black hole.

121
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,632
DAX:
Oh, my muscles
are so sore.

122
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,383
Did you ever wrestle

123
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,803
Galeo-Manada
style, Arjin?

124
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:27,762
Wrestle?

125
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,139
DAX:
You should.

126
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:30,891
It's a great way
to start the day.

127
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,017
It makes you
more alert.

128
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,601
I'll set you
up with Trajok.

129
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,145
He's a great coach.

130
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:37,272
Okay.

131
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,193
Mmm... better.

132
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:43,153
So, you don't play<i> tongo...</i>

133
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:44,779
you don't wrestle.

134
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,241
What<i> are</i> we going to
do while you're here?

135
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:49,326
Well, I was under
the impression

136
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:50,911
that field training
consisted of...

137
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,579
I know all about
field training.

138
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,040
Jadzia went through it
a few years ago.

139
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,666
Yes, ma'am.

140
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:01,129
Arjin, if you truly want
to become a Trill host someday

141
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,382
you'll never call me
"ma'am" again.

142
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:05,550
Yes... Lieutenant.

143
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:09,263
Why don't you try "Jadzia"?

144
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,308
If you think
that's appropriate.

145
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:18,521
Oh, I'm sure it isn't
appropriate at all.

146
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,108
But then, I hate
to be appropriate.

147
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,199
(<i> thump and cry of pain</i> )

148
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,577
Nothing!

149
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:36,790
Ah!

150
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,499
Over here, Chief.

151
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,351
Oh.

152
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:59,271
All right, come to Papa.

153
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:01,522
SISKO: Major?

154
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,983
Voles, sir.

155
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,276
Voles?

156
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,486
Cardassian
legacy.

157
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,029
They weren't
bothering us

158
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,740
till we started moving
into areas of the station

159
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,533
that they'd been hiding in.

160
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:16,663
Now they're spreading
out all over the place.

161
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:20,834
They seem to be attracted
to electromagnetic fields.

162
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,710
Give me a hand,
Major, will you?

163
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,298
Phasers on stun,
Mr. O'Brien.

164
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,468
I want those voles taken alive.

165
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,678
Benjamin, I'd like
you to meet Arjin

166
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,763
the host candidate
I told you about.

167
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,140
Commander Benjamin Sisko.

168
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,391
Sir.

169
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,892
And that's
our First Officer

170
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,687
Major Kira, and Chief
Engineer O'Brien

171
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,605
conducting repairs?

172
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,858
Chasing
Cardassian voles.

173
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,026
Really?

174
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,028
I've never seen
a Cardassian vole.

175
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,363
Oh...

176
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,822
be my guest.

177
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:56,328
So, you're the one who
picked the black marble.

178
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,329
Sir?

179
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:58,663
Field training with Dax

180
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,041
was the nightmare
of the initiate corps.

181
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,876
DAX:
That was
<i>Curzon</i> Dax.

182
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:03,877
(<i> phaser fires</i> )

183
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,128
Gotcha!

184
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,796
Arjin, here.

185
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,190
Spectacular, isn't it?

186
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,901
Uh... it's amazing.

187
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:39,120
Computer, play something
by Frenchotte.

188
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,247
Frenchotte?

189
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,998
A self-exiled Romulan.

190
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,375
I collect forgotten composers.

191
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,667
(<i> classical music plays</i> )

192
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,669
You feel like taking
the controls?

193
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,838
I've never flown
a Federation
runabout before.

194
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,840
These things practically
fly themselves.

195
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:53,927
You have third-level
flight experience, don't you?

196
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:57,472
Actually, I just finished
my fifth level last month.

197
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,682
Fifth! I didn't
finish third until...

198
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,601
Your last year
of training.

199
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,520
You've been studying up
on me, Arjin.

200
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:05,688
Well, I can't say
that I blame you.

201
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,566
I did the same thing
when I found out

202
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,692
who my field docent
was going to be.

203
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,487
And how did you feel
when you found out

204
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:13,988
it was going to be<i> Curzon Dax?</i>

205
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,617
"Nauseous" might be
the best description.

206
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:21,079
I suppose it wouldn't be fair
for you to give me a few tips.

207
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,622
Tips?

208
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,832
On how you managed
to impress him.

209
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,377
Look, let's get
one thing straight.

210
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:30,255
I'm not Curzon or Lela
or any of the others.

211
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:31,798
I'm Jadzia Dax.

212
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,551
Jadzia's only a few years
older than you are.

213
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:37,220
You're
her first initiate.

214
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,306
To be honest, in a lot of ways

215
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:42,016
I still feel
like an initiate, myself.

216
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:45,228
I can still remember
the pressure of competition

217
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,606
when Jadzia was going
through it.

218
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:50,066
And I'm not going
to make this difficult for you.

219
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,235
You don't have
to impress me, okay?

220
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:55,322
Okay.

221
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,157
Okay.

222
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,075
So, how did you?

223
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,496
Impress him?

224
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,247
I didn't.

225
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:07,584
Curzon recommended that my
initiate period be terminated.

226
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:13,590
I've got it! Engaging
manual stabilizers.

227
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:15,509
Shutting down all engines.

228
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,093
Computer, analyze
stability loss.

229
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,137
<i>Stability loss</i>
<i>was due to an impact</i>

230
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,722
<i>by a subspace</i>
<i>interphase pocket.</i>

231
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,517
Nature of
interphase pocket?

232
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,352
<i>Unknown.</i>

233
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,603
Damage report.

234
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:28,605
<i>Starboard nacelle</i>
<i>nonfunctional.</i>

235
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:32,150
<i>Maximum available power</i>
<i>50 percent.</i>

236
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:35,111
Jadzia...

237
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,572
you better take
a look at this.

238
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,994
DAX:
Looks like we
snagged something

239
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,621
from that
subspace pocket.

240
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:47,957
Computer, identify mass
on the starboard nacelle.

241
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:50,335
<i>Unknown.</i>

242
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,685
Maybe we could create

243
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,603
some kind of EM pathway
along the inner hull

244
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:09,812
and try to lure them
into a trap.

245
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,481
Uh-huh, but how
could you do that

246
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:13,816
without shutting down all
the other power systems?

247
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,027
I can't, and it would take
days to round them all up.

248
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,779
We'd have to evacuate
the station.

249
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,990
The only other thing
I can come up with

250
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:23,660
is a directional
sonic generator.

251
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:25,579
Now, I can adjust
it to a frequency

252
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,330
that'll be
uncomfortable
to their ears

253
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,374
and drive them out of
hiding, one at a time.

254
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,125
But, at that rate,
I'll be doing this

255
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,669
for the rest of
my tour of duty.

256
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:35,380
It ran right across
a dabo table!

257
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,382
How'd it die?

258
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:40,009
Get into your food?

259
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:42,178
As landlords,
you're responsible for this.

260
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,390
I expect vermin control,
or I'm going to have to...

261
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,850
Leave?
Oh, please say, "Leave."

262
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:51,312
I'd take a Cardassian vole
over you any day.

263
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,190
The girl insists
on fighting

264
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:55,483
her latent attraction
to me.

265
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,151
(<i> laughs raucously</i> )

266
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,237
What<i> are</i> you going to do
about these pests, O'Brien?

267
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,739
Relax, Quark.

268
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,198
We're working on something new

269
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,200
that ought to make the voles
beg for mercy.

270
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:05,243
What is it?

271
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,621
Well, a sonic...

272
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:10,831
(<i> screaming in pain</i> )

273
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,917
Stop!

274
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,507
You all right?

275
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,259
Are you all right?

276
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,427
What?

277
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,844
Chief, the<i> Mekong</i>
just came back

278
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:24,803
through the wormhole.

279
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,056
They're showing damage.

280
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:28,266
SISKO: Open a channel, Major.

281
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,643
Put them on screen.

282
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:30,727
Are you all right, Dax?

283
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,437
Our power reserves are gone.

284
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:33,480
We could use a tow.

285
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,564
What happened?

286
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:35,856
Not exactly sure.

287
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,984
We picked up some kind
of subspace seaweed

288
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,611
on our starboard nacelle.

289
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:42,280
We couldn't get rid of it
without causing further damage.

290
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,031
You can shut down your
engines, Lieutenant.

291
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,617
We'll bring
you into Pad D.

292
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,577
Set up a containment chamber
in the Science Lab

293
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:48,745
for me, would you, Chief?

294
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:50,330
When we get this thing untangled

295
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,666
I'd like to study it
under controlled conditions.

296
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:54,083
We'll need a
couple of hours.

297
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,627
Morning will be fine.

298
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,337
That'll give Arjin and me
a little time to recoup.

299
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,797
Acknowledged.

300
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,006
Stop by
and fill me in later.

301
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,132

Can you believe it?

A Klingon song

00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,659
You haven't touched your<i> racht.</i>

318
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:11,369
No, I have.

319
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,496
It's interesting.

320
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:16,249
No, you've moved it
around your plate

321
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,168
to make it look like
you've touched it.

322
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,004
I didn't have to move it.
It moved itself.

323
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,465
Arjin, if this didn't
appeal to you

324
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,384
why didn't you
say something?

325
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,344
No, it's all right.

326
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:30,096
I wasn't really
very hungry, anyway.

327
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:35,059
Speak up for yourself
while you're here, okay?

328
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,520
I'll make a concerted effort.

329
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:44,444
So... who sponsored you
for the program?

330
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,362
My father.

331
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:48,322
Was he joined?

332
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,868
No, but he had great
ambitions for his children.

333
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:55,914
He was a pilot instructor
at the Gedana post for 40 years.

334
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,331
He died last year.

335
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,627
I see where you got
your flight skills.

336
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,003
My sister was always
his choice for joining

337
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,089
but after she got accepted
to the program

338
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,800
she ran off and got married.

339
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:09,051
My father never
spoke to her again.

340
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,804
On the day
that he died

341
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:13,681
he turned to me, and he said

342
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,892
"I'm counting on you."

343
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:18,978
His last words to me.

344
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,357
Did he want you to enter
Starfleet after joining?

345
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,694
To put your flight training
to good use?

346
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,155
Honestly, he couldn't care less
what I did afterwards

347
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,282
as long as I became joined.

348
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,784
That was
his only goal.

349
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:37,121
And what about<i> your</i> goals?

350
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:43,127
There are so many possibilities
when you're joined.

351
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,338
I'm not sure what I'd do yet.

352
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,256
I figured I'd get
a lot of guidance

353
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:49,300
from the symbiont,
wouldn't you say?

354
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,845
Well, a symbiont's
influence<i> is</i>

355
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:54,973
very strong, Arjin,
but you're the host.

356
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,933
You've got to be strong enough

357
00:16:56,975 --> 00:17:00,186
to balance that influence
with your own instincts.

358
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:03,731
If you can't, the symbiont
will overwhelm your personality.

359
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,200
Oh, they are a nuisance,
aren't they?

360
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,536
I was hoping you found
a way to deal with them.

361
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,121
Federation technology
isn't up to the task, eh?

362
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,790
Look, I just thought
in the interests

363
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:22,333
of good relations,
you might...

364
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,085
You've got the station.
You've got the voles.

365
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,963
By the way, their
mating season

366
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,715
begins in about six weeks.

367
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,174
Thanks for your help.

368
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:33,302
The Federation could always
withdraw from Baj...

369
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,014
What's this?

370
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,598
Got me. It's
from Julian.

371
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,976
He called it the solution
you've been looking for.

372
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:47,107
"It worked in Hamlin."

373
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,779
Very funny.

374
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:01,247
Your move.

375
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,875
Your seaweed's been safely
transported to the Science Lab.

376
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,334
Did you take
a look at it?

377
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:06,878
Mm-hmm. What
do you think?

378
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,088
We did as much analysis
on the runabout as we could.

379
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:12,132
None of the
matter would scan.

380
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,718
We'll do more
tests tomorrow.

381
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,637
How'd your initiate come
through the experience?

382
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:17,931
Fine.

383
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,599
He's a good pilot.

384
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,600
Uh-oh.

385
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:21,726
What?

386
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:22,810
I know that look.

387
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,645
What look?

388
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,146
<i>That</i> look, old man.

389
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,314
The one that says

390
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,692
"This one isn't
going to make it."

391
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,819
Not because of me.

392
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,905
But you have your doubts.

393
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:34,948
I have my doubts.

394
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,449
What is his problem?

395
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,367
I'm not sure what
he brings as a host

396
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:39,786
how he'll advance
a symbiont

397
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,412
to the next level.

398
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,873
Frankly, he's more than a
little arrogant, Benjamin.

399
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:45,875
Is he?

400
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:47,835
Okay, for a Trill,
that's to be expected.

401
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,212
Check. But he's riding
his father's ambitions

402
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,798
and he doesn't
have any idea

403
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,258
what he'd do with a
symbiont if he got one.

404
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,094
Have you confronted him?

405
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,805
It's not my job
to confront him.

406
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,057
Isn't it?

407
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:03,392
My job is to show
him what it's like

408
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:06,062
to function as a joined
Trill-- that's all.

409
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:07,981
I can show you
the guidelines.

410
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:09,107
They're very clear.

411
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,399
Mm-hmm.

412
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,654
Who am I to confront him?

413
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,075
You're Dax.

414
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:21,828
Yes, but I'm not Curzon Dax

415
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,705
and I won't do to him
what Curzon did to me.

416
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,374
So...

417
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,211
what<i> are</i> you going to do?

418
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,967
This kid has
to measure up soon

419
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,385
or he'll never be chosen.

420
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,097
True?

421
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:43,474
So, you're not
doing him any favors

422
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,852
by avoiding
a confrontation, are you?

423
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:49,605
Curzon was tough--

424
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:52,900
maybe even abusive
in his own charming way--

425
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,360
but he always demanded

426
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:57,113
the highest standards
of excellence

427
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:59,032
from these host candidates.

428
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:01,241
You don't know
what he did to me.

429
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,452
I know you made it
through the program.

430
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,873
No thanks to him.

431
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,749
Are you sure?

432
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:49,165
Voles have eaten through the
security field's energy lines.

433
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:52,085
No telling how long
it'll take me to
set up another field.

434
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:54,461
So, nothing is secure
on this station anymore?

435
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,671
Is there any reason
to believe

436
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:57,381
there's an imminent threat
from this?

437
00:20:57,423 --> 00:21:00,051
Not as far as I can tell,
but I can't tell you a lot yet.

438
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:01,635
I want to know
what we're dealing with

439
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:02,887
as soon as possible.

440
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:05,305
I'll schedule
a briefing for 1400 hours.

441
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,349
And take those phasers
off stun, Chief!

442
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,768
No more Mr. Nice Guy.

443
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,231
Arjin, how's your
astrophysics profile?

444
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,941
It's one of my
better subjects.

445
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,818
Maybe that's why I was
sent here to work with you.

446
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:21,781
Set me up
a gravimetric microprobe.

447
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,658
I need to calibrate
the energy profile.

448
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,077
Jadzia...

449
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:28,246
I felt that last night

450
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,624
maybe I didn't express myself
well about my own goals.

451
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:34,794
I think you expressed
yourself<i> very</i> clearly.

452
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,503
I just didn't want you to think

453
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,338
that I hadn't<i> set</i> any
goals for post-joining.

454
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,591
I have thought
about Starfleet.

455
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,676
With my flight training,
it would be a perfect...

456
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,512
Starfleet's a career.
A pilot's a job.

457
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,224
What does that have to do
with being joined?

458
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:50,893
I'm not sure I understand.

459
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:53,312
No, I don't think
you do.

460
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:54,730
I'm sorry?

461
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:57,691
I think you're telling me
what I want to hear.

462
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,110
That's not true.

463
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:01,862
I think you went to your
quarters last night

464
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:04,031
and you tossed
and turned in bed

465
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:06,408
because you knew
some of the things

466
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,410
you said to me
concerned me.

467
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,288
And now you're
trying to fix it.

468
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,372
I'm... I'm just
trying to clarify...

469
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,749
I know what it's like.

470
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,626
I've tossed and turned myself.

471
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,628
Please don't insult me
by denying it.

472
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,049
I'm finished.

473
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:25,469
Let's run a phase
variant analysis.

474
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:32,601
I'm worried
about you, Arjin.

475
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:33,686
Worried?

476
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,647
I'm worried you're not
preparing yourself

477
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,858
for being joined.

478
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,567
That's it?

479
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,321
A day and a half,
and you've made up your mind.

480
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:44,738
I didn't say that.

481
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,740
Look, you've
gotten this far

482
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,743
by anticipating every demand
of the program

483
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:53,455
and performing above everyone's
expectations, am I right?

484
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,666
I'd like to think that's true.

485
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,085
And I'm telling you,
from this point on

486
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:01,339
that's not going to be
good enough.

487
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:02,882
(<i> console bleeping</i> )

488
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:06,260
Highly structured, but it
doesn't seem to conform

489
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:08,095
to any of our physical laws.

490
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:11,057
Computer, run a spectral line
profile analysis.

491
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:14,685
<i>Spectral analysis will take</i>
<i>approximately seven minutes.</i>

492
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:18,564
Just to... speak up for myself,

493
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:22,193
I'm feeling
a little betrayed here.

494
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:24,237
I mean, after your impassioned

495
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:27,990
"I am Jadzia, fellow initiate"
speech in the runabout...

496
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:29,075
I understand

497
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,492
why you feel that way

498
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,078
but this isn't about me.

499
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,705
This is about the standards
for Trill hosts.

500
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,250
The opportunity is too rare
and too important

501
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:39,210
to waste on the wrong candidate.

502
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:45,799
And in your mind,
I'm a wrong candidate?

503
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,177
I don't know that yet.

504
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:52,430
But I felt it only fair to let
you know I am worried about you.

505
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:55,268
I see.

506
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:01,023
I should have known this.

507
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:03,859
I should have realized this.

508
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:06,444
You're Dax.

509
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:09,740
"Standards for Trill hosts"?

510
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:12,701
That is really incredible
coming from<i> you.</i>

511
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:15,079
I have never seen
any host in my life

512
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:18,749
who is so far below those
standards as you are,<i> ma'am.</i>

513
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:24,922
No wonder Curzon Dax tried
to terminate your training.

514
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,814
I was finally able to read
the EM flux.

515
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,441
There are high plasma
concentrations

516
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:45,025
in a rapidly-expanding mass.

517
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:46,235
How rapidly?

518
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:47,736
The energy buildup

519
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:49,947
is already straining
the containment chamber.

520
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:52,074
On top of that, the mass
periodically undergoes

521
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:53,159
phased expansions

522
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,661
and grows in spurts.

523
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:57,204
It's a very specific
growth pattern

524
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:58,747
that the computer recognized.

525
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:00,416
Recognized as what?

526
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:02,835
The expansion patterns
of a universe.

527
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,295
What?

528
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:05,921
A universe?

529
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:08,506
What we have here, Benjamin,
is a proto-universe

530
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:11,551
in its earliest stages
of formation.

531
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,304
Unfortunately,
as it grows

532
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:15,389
it's displacing
our own universe.

533
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:17,808
Can we get it back
where it came from?

534
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,352
This has turned
into an energy mass

535
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:21,020
with properties
that don't conform

536
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,520
to our own laws of nature.

537
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:24,231
I have no idea
what might happen

538
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:25,816
if we tried to move it

539
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:28,486
let alone take it back
into the wormhole.

540
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:29,903
Even if we
get it there,

541
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,864
the wormhole's
verteron nodes

542
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:34,408
would probably interact
with the energy fluctuations

543
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:38,037
of the protouniverse,
causing a devastating reaction.

544
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,122
It could threaten
this whole system.

545
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:41,748
And if we don't do anything,

546
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,876
it'll eventually obliterate
this system, and beyond.

547
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,170
Can't we contain
it somehow?

548
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:47,671
DAX:
Not without
destroying it.

549
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:48,964
Under the circumstances

550
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:50,883
that sounds like
a pretty good option to me.

551
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:53,219
DAX: We can create a force field
that will contain it.

552
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,761
If we can suppress it
long enough

553
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,806
the feedback pressure should
create an implosive wave.

554
00:25:57,848 --> 00:25:59,266
It would self-destruct.

555
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:01,435
How long before
the next phase
of expansion?

556
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,561
About three hours.

557
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:07,941
The collateral shock waves
will probably destroy the lab.

558
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:11,070
Can we get this
containment field
ready by then?

559
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,612
Yes, sir.

560
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,074
Have Odo evacuate
Section 14.

561
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,742
SISKO: Dismissed.

562
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:26,877
Ah...

563
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,795
Another?

564
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,923
Just keep pouring
until I drown.

565
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,299
Sounds pretty serious.

566
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,301
Serious? No.

567
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:36,678
I just threw my whole
life out a porthole--

568
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,013
nothing serious.

569
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:39,597
There isn't a problem
in the world

570
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:41,767
that can't be fixed
by the right holosuite program.

571
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:44,520
Never trust a Trill, Quark.

572
00:26:44,562 --> 00:26:46,855
Why not?

573
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:48,690
They're... two-faced.

574
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,025
Does that go
for all Trills

575
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:52,069
or just for the ones
with the worm?

576
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:55,573
Any worm named Dax.

577
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:58,616
Did she break
your heart, son?

578
00:26:58,658 --> 00:26:59,743
What?

579
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:00,911
Mine, too.

580
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,662
And Bashir is in here
every other day

581
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,498
crying into
his synthale over her.

582
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,125
The Promenade is littered
with the bodies...

583
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,626
It wasn't my heart she broke.

584
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:11,130
It was<i> me.</i>

585
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,798
My career, my life...

586
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,007
Wait a minute.

587
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,633
Is this about
all that "initiate" stuff?

588
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:19,388
She told me I wasn't
preparing myself to join.

589
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,848
With the worm?
So, that's<i> her</i> opinion.

590
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,434
What's that worth, anyhow?

591
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:24,851
A bad recommendation

592
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,313
from your field docent,
and you can forget it.

593
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:30,190
Listen, son, when I was
a young man, no older than you,

594
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:34,945
I had an apprentice position
with the District Sub-Nagus.

595
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:37,114
I licked his boots
like you couldn't believe.

596
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:39,074
He loved me.
I was his golden boy.

597
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:40,409
I was on the high road

598
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:43,370
to the top of the Ferengi
business world

599
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:44,955
and then, it all fell apart.

600
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:46,123
How?

601
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:49,126
Rule of Acquisition 112:

602
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:52,212
"Never have sex
with the boss' sister."

603
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,466
I was fired, broke.

604
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:58,760
It was quite a setback
to my ambitions.

605
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:01,221
Well... how did you recover?

606
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:02,306
Never did.

607
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:03,516
Look at me--

608
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:05,100
tending bar out here
in wormhole junction

609
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:08,395
while the big boys
fly by me at warp speed.

610
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:12,274
You only get one shot
at the latinum stairway.

611
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:15,819
If you miss it,
you miss it.

612
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:19,697
Welcome to the club, son.

613
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:22,742
Well... thanks.

614
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:25,454
Glad I could help.

615
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:45,724
Computer, confirm
the localized entropy decrease

616
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:46,725
in the energy mass.

617
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:48,352
<i>Confirmed.</i>

618
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:50,729
How much have the readings
decreased in the last hour?

619
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,357
<i>Localized entropy readings</i>
<i>have decreased 12 percent</i>

620
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:55,108
<i>during the last 58 minutes.</i>

621
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,985
This can't be right.

622
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:58,278
The whole thermodynamic
structure

623
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,113
would have to be changing.

624
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,949
Activate a quantometer probe.

625
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,827
Verify filter calibration.

626
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,871
<i>Filter calibration verified.</i>

627
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:12,042
Set energy flux resolution
to 0.1 microdyne.

628
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:15,546
Begin high-resolution
energy scans.

629
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:18,298
There must be a malfunction
in the sensors.

630
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,467
Computer, run a self-diagnostic

631
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:22,886
and check
quantometer calibration.

632
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,804
<i>Calibration is locked</i>
<i>and normal.</i>

633
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,390
<i>Diagnostic underway.</i>

634
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:29,809
Are there any feedback anomalies
in the dynametric array?

635
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:30,894
<i>Negative.</i>

636
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:32,521
What's the feedback reading?

637
00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:35,482
<i>Feedback reading is zero.</i>

638
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:36,858
<i>Diagnostic complete.</i>

639
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,361
<i>Sensors are</i>
<i>functioning normally.</i>

640
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,156
ODO:<i> Odo to Sisko.</i>

641
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,241
Yes, Odo?

642
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:46,493
<i>Section 14 has been evacuated.</i>

643
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:47,869
Acknowledged.
Mr. O'Brien?

644
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,496
Just finishing,
Commander.

645
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:52,040
Sisko to Dax.
We're preparing
to establish

646
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:55,085
the containment field.
I want you out of
the lab during this.

647
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,920
I'm already out, Benjamin
but I'm not sure

648
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:58,880
you're going
to want to do this now.

649
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,382
Why not?

650
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:03,802
I found indications of life
in the protouniverse.

651
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:13,186
DAX:
Non-random thermodynamics...

652
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,855
irregular power consumption.

653
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:18,609
The computer's confirmed it.
These are life signs.

654
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:19,859
Now, wait a minute.

655
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:22,112
Single-cell microbes
are life-forms, too

656
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:24,531
but Dr. Bashir has
a hypospray that'll kill them

657
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:26,325
to say nothing
of the voles.

658
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,534
Kira, we could very well

659
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:29,286
be dealing with
intelligent life here.

660
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:30,788
Well, how
is that possible?

661
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,540
You told us that
this protouniverse
was just formed.

662
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:36,460
It's quite possible.
We may have only
experienced hours

663
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:37,795
since this universe
was formed

664
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:38,962
but there's no
way of knowing

665
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:40,589
how fast time
is moving for them.

666
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:42,966
Theoretically,
billions of years
may have passed.

667
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:44,593
An entire
evolution
of a species

668
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:45,594
might have
taken place

669
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:46,679
within the
last few hours.

670
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,846
It's possible.

671
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,014
O'BRIEN:
<i>O'Brien to Sisko.</i>

672
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:50,307
Go ahead, Chief.

673
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,100
Commander,
if we're going to implement

674
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:53,852
that containment field,
we'd better do it now.

675
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,688
In two minutes,
this thing's going to expand.

676
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:57,314
Get your people
out of there, Chief.

677
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:59,274
We're not going
to put up the
containment field.

678
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:00,275
<i>Aye, sir.</i>

679
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:01,527
Commander,
this is only

680
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,153
going to delay
the inevitable.

681
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,780
Take us to Yellow
Alert, Major.

682
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:06,532
Move the repair
crews into position.

683
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,963
COMPUTER:
Warning, hull breach.

684
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,549
Level 22, Section 14.

685
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,591
Sisko to O'Brien.

686
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:26,009
Seal off Section 14.

687
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:27,636
Move your repair crews in.

688
00:31:27,678 --> 00:31:29,012
O'BRIEN:<i> Aye, sir.</i>

689
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:31,306
How long before
the next expansion?

690
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:32,307
Roughly five hours.

691
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:34,059
How much will it expand?

692
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,895
About 300 percent.
We'll lose a whole section
of the station.

693
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,856
By tomorrow,
the station will be gone.

694
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,607
BASHIR: We could beam
them into space--

695
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:42,651
give us some more time
to come up with a solution.

696
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:44,194
KIRA:
We already have
a solution

697
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:45,612
and the longer we wait

698
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:46,822
the harder it's going to be
to implement it.

699
00:31:46,864 --> 00:31:49,115
I'm sorry, but it's us or them.

700
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,492
We have to destroy it.

701
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:52,745
You can't just wipe
out a civilization.

702
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:54,788
We'd be committing
mass murder.

703
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,832
It's like stepping on ants, Odo.

704
00:31:56,874 --> 00:31:59,167
I don't step
on ants, Major.

705
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,879
Just because we
don't understand

706
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,757
a life-form, doesn't
mean we can destroy it.

707
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:06,800
Well, do you have a better idea?

708
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:10,846
Does anyone?

709
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:13,973
I'll give you my decision
in an hour.

710
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,903
SISKO:
<i>Personal Log, supplemental.</i>

711
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,112
<i>One hour.</i>

712
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,364
<i>One hour to make a decision</i>

713
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:32,743
<i>that could mean the life</i>
<i>or death of a civilization</i>

714
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:34,745
<i>or the end to our own.</i>

715
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:38,081
<i>My mind keeps going back</i>
<i>to the Borg.</i>

716
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:41,877
<i>How I despised</i>
<i>their indifference</i>

717
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,337
<i>as they tried</i>
<i>to exterminate us.</i>

718
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:47,966
<i>And I have to ask myself,</i>
<i>"Would I be any different</i>

719
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:52,053
<i>if I destroyed another universe</i>
<i>to preserve my own?"</i>

720
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,976
Hey.

721
00:32:58,017 --> 00:32:59,102
Hi, Dad.

722
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:01,271
What are you doing
back so early?

723
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:03,064
I just wanted to see you.

724
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:07,778
He told you, didn't he?

725
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,070
Told me what?

726
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,948
Chief O'Brien.
Darn it, he promised.

727
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,866
If there's something
you want to tell me

728
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:15,243
I want to hear it.

729
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:23,376
I love her, Dad.

730
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:24,878
Okay.

731
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,589
She's everything I ever
wanted in a woman.

732
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:29,716
I'm sure she's
a wonderful girl.

733
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:32,051
Oh, she's not a
girl; she's a woman.

734
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,471
She doesn't like to
be called "girl."

735
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,431
Everyone calls her
that, and she hates it.

736
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:38,391
She wants to be something
better than that.

737
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,768
Than what?

738
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,895
Than a dabo girl.

739
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:44,898
You're in love
with a dabo girl?

740
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,274
Wait a minute.

741
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:47,734
You said Chief O'Brien
told you that...

742
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,319
No, I didn't.

743
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:52,531
Who is she,
and how old is she, Jake?

744
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,615
Oh, geez...

745
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:55,116
I wanted to tell you

746
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,536
but I was sure you
wouldn't understand.

747
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,538
So, now you're hiding
things from me?

748
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,039
You mean, you would
have understood?

749
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,415
Of course not.

750
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:08,797
It's Mardah, isn't it?

751
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:13,552
The one you've been
tutoring in entomology.

752
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:16,013
I really want you
to meet her, Dad.

753
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,556
I really want
to meet<i> her.</i>

754
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:20,475
Can I invite her
to dinner tonight?

755
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:22,477
No.

756
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:25,063
Not tonight.

757
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:26,857
But soon.

758
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:28,608
Thanks, Dad.

759
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,151
You'll love her.

760
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,910
DAX:
What's so interesting
in there?

761
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:39,411
I can see my future.

762
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:41,914
I wouldn't trust
a glass of synthale

763
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:44,123
to tell you the future.

764
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:47,085
Let's just get this
over with, okay?

765
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:50,296
Just use a sharp blade,
so I won't feel it.

766
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:54,051
You don't know me as well
as you think you do.

767
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:57,303
I'm sure you looked
at all the training profiles

768
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:00,306
but that doesn't tell you
who Jadzia really was

769
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,100
before she was joined.

770
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:07,064
She was the quietest, shyest

771
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,858
most withdrawn young woman
you've ever known.

772
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,111
Brilliant...
top grades...

773
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:16,281
and not a clue
to what life was about.

774
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:18,867
She had never lived
outside the program

775
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:20,368
and it didn't matter

776
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,913
because she was sailing
through it.

777
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:25,290
Until she met Curzon Dax.

778
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:29,753
Curzon sized her up
in about 20 seconds

779
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:34,132
and made the next two weeks
the most miserable of her life.

780
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:37,510
She cried herself
to sleep every night.

781
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:40,639
She hated him for it.

782
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,474
But when the field
training was over

783
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,142
and she learned about
Curzon's recommendation

784
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:47,020
to terminate her
from the program

785
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:49,106
she went back a different woman.

786
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,691
She found her voice
and reapplied.

787
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:55,487
She tore through the program
with a passion, a vengeance.

788
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,822
And in the end

789
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:59,491
the administrators
chose her for joining.

790
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:02,243
How did you wind up
with the Dax symbiont?

791
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:03,787
When I found out

792
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:07,290
Curzon was dying,
I requested the Dax symbiont.

793
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,042
And Curzon didn't object?

794
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:10,251
No.

795
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,796
And I've never been sure
quite why.

796
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:16,883
Except, as I've come to know
Curzon's dark sense of humor

797
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:21,013
I have a feeling the irony
might have appealed to him.

798
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:24,724
Jadzia Dax
is not Curzon Dax.

799
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:27,185
But I<i> am</i> Dax

800
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:31,106
and I am slowly coming to terms
with what that means to me.

801
00:36:31,148 --> 00:36:33,692
Sometimes it means
gambling or wrestling.

802
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:36,528
Sometimes it means
waking up an initiate

803
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:40,490
before he slides into the middle
of the pack and gets overlooked.

804
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:43,368
You're giving me another chance?

805
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:46,913
You are the only one who can
give yourself another chance.

806
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:48,331
You can't simply do this anymore

807
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,750
to meet other people's
expectations--

808
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:55,088
not your father's,
not your teachers', not mine.

809
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,464
You need to discover

810
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:58,800
what Arjin wants
out of life,
out of joining.

811
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:00,886
SISKO:
Lieutenant...

812
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,055
we'll try to take it back
through the wormhole.

813
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:04,848
How soon can you be ready?

814
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,474
I want to be sure
the containment field

815
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:08,727
can block out
any verteron-node radiation

816
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,353
as we pass through it.

817
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:12,022
Uh, about two hours?

818
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:14,482
Better get started.

819
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:19,112
Wouldn't hurt to have
a level-five pilot along.

820
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,917
Chief?

821
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,878
The containment
field is in place
and holding, sir

822
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,671
but I'd like to run
a practical test

823
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:38,090
on the verteron integrity.

824
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:39,632
"Like to"
or "need to"?

825
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,551
That thing expands again
in less than an hour.

826
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,428
Well, this is
the strongest force field

827
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:44,930
I know
how to construct, sir.

828
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,848
A test would
at least give us the odds

829
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,975
of getting it through
the wormhole intact.

830
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:50,309
I'm not playing
the odds today.

831
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,978
Sisko to<i> Rio Grande.</i>
Your status?

832
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,190
DAX: Systems check complete.
Auxiliary power to shields.

833
00:37:55,232 --> 00:37:57,109
I'd say we're packed and
ready to go, Benjamin.

834
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,526
Ready transporter.

835
00:37:58,568 --> 00:37:59,861
O'BRIEN: Locking onto
the containment field.

836
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:00,946
Energize.

837
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,492
Chief, we're getting
a phase variation here.

838
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,203
Stand by.

839
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:11,206
The energy fluctuations are
driving the transporter crazy.

840
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,794
DAX: We've got it now.

841
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:18,213
Switching your transporter
to secure mode.

842
00:38:18,255 --> 00:38:20,257
O'BRIEN:
Readings
are stable.

843
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,466
SISKO: When you're
ready, Dax.

844
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,760
Take us out
gently, Arjin.

845
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:25,678
Firing thrusters.

846
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:34,146
O'BRIEN:
Energy readings from the
containment field are holding.

847
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:36,273
Take us to 50 kph.

848
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,775
Confirmed, 17 seconds
to wormhole.

849
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,485
Hold at 50 kph.

850
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,112
Ten seconds
to the wormhole.

851
00:38:42,154 --> 00:38:44,281
Reading higher levels
of neutrino activity.

852
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,158
A short cross
to the other side

853
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,408
and we're home free.

854
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,660
<i>Rio Grande</i> to Ops.

855
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:51,037
Com links will terminate
in five seconds.

856
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,915
<i>See you later.</i>

857
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:56,042
Acknowledged,
<i>Rio Grande.</i>

858
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:00,922
May the Prophets guide you.

859
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:13,310
DAX: Containment-field stability
is down to 85 percent.

860
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,394
Every time we pass through
a verteron node

861
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,105
there's resonance leakage
from the energy mass.

862
00:39:17,147 --> 00:39:18,857
In 20 seconds,
we'll be out of here.

863
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,441
We'll never make it.

864
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,944
Field stability is down
to 65 percent and falling.

865
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:24,946
We've got to kill
our forward acceleration now!

866
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:27,532
All engines stop.

867
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:31,244
38 percent stability,
still falling...

868
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:33,705
26 percent...

869
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:36,291
Computer, thrusters on reverse,
two-second burst.

870
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:39,460
All stop.

871
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:45,758
It's stabilizing.

872
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,012
The containment field
is at 27 percent.

873
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:51,723
26 percent and holding.

874
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:00,273
Now what?

875
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:01,941
Well, we can't
stay here.

876
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:04,319
In 42 minutes, that
energy mass expands.

877
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:05,570
And once it
intersects

878
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,405
with one of those
verteron nodes

879
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:09,574
they'll feel the result
in the Cardassian home world.

880
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,076
But the containment field
is so weak now

881
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,911
it will fail as soon as we start
to move again.

882
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:15,038
Then I guess we'll just
have to let it fail.

883
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,497
Let it fail?

884
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,624
But you said it yourself,

885
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,919
if we pass through even
one of those verteron nodes

886
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,755
without the containment field,
the energy mass will explode.

887
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,840
Then we'll just have
to avoid them.

888
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:28,218
You're talking
about precision flying

889
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,510
through a wormhole.

890
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:30,803
It's never been done.

891
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,555
Until now.

892
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:33,598
Jadzia...

893
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,933
I'm a level-three
pilot.

894
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,642
You're a level-five.

895
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,520
I'll do it if I have to,
but I don't have time to argue.

896
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,857
Watch the conn read-outs.

897
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:46,194
I'll try to keep at least
50 meters away from any node.

898
00:40:46,236 --> 00:40:47,528
Understood.

899
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,655
Computer, calibrate
internal scanners

900
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,325
to detect verteron radiation
in the cabin.

901
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:54,119
Activate sonic indicators.

902
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,871
Verteron levels are
well within safe limits.

903
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:58,790
We'll start with
one short thruster blast

904
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:00,583
and we'll coast through.

905
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,919
That'll protect the containment
field for a few extra seconds.

906
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:04,212
Thrusters ready.

907
00:41:04,254 --> 00:41:06,589
I'm taking the inertial
dampers off-line.

908
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:07,924
It'll be a rougher ride

909
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:11,136
but I'll have a little more
response time.

910
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,637
Firing thrusters.

911
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:20,437
Velocity is
at 40 meters per second.

912
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,648
COMPUTER:
<i>Warning, containment field</i>
<i>at 10 percent.</i>

913
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:25,233
60 seconds to Gamma.

914
00:41:25,275 --> 00:41:26,818
Node to starboard

915
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:29,737
bearing 037 mark seven.

916
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:32,198
Firing starboard thruster.

917
00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:39,747
COMPUTER:
<i>Warning.</i>

918
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,040
<i>Containment field</i>
<i>has collapsed.</i>

919
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:45,378
No more margin for error.

920
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,672
45 seconds to Gamma.

921
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:51,384
Node to port,
bearing 030 mark 51.

922
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:53,345
I've got it.

923
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:00,185
35 seconds to Gamma.

924
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:02,228
Verteron levels are still okay.

925
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:05,564
Jadzia, look at this.

926
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:08,818
We're never going
to get through it.

927
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,278
Reading a passage.

928
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,823
Adjust heading
to 130 mark 47.

929
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,408
Confirmed.

930
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:18,661
Sensors say it's directly ahead.

931
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:21,373
I don't see it.

932
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:23,249
Hold your course.

933
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:24,376
I don't see it!

934
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:27,586
I see it!

935
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:30,465
It's less than 17 meters across.

936
00:42:30,507 --> 00:42:32,384
The ship is only 14 meters wide.

937
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:34,677
That gives you over two meters
to work with.

938
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:45,021
Verteron levels are red-lining.

939
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,150
Five seconds to Gamma.

940
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:03,415
This is going to look very good
on your initiate record, Arjin.

941
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:06,459
Now, let's get
this thing

942
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,627
back where it belongs.

943
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:18,179
There's one thing
I want to do before I go

944
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:19,638
and that is to apologize

945
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,267
for the things I said
to you in the lab.

946
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:25,603
That was the first
time you were being
honest with me.

947
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:29,065
Somehow, I always expected that
joining would make any Trill...

948
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:33,236
complete, serene,
wise beyond her years.

949
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:35,654
And I'm none
of those things?

950
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:39,409
What I mean is,
you're nothing
like I expected.

951
00:43:39,451 --> 00:43:41,660
I'm nothing
like I expected.

952
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:42,870
Life after life--

953
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:44,663
with each new personality

954
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,665
stampeding around
in your head--

955
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,834
you get desires
that scare you

956
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,837
dreams that used to belong
to someone else.

957
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,257
I wouldn't recommend
it for everyone

958
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:57,093
but, in time, I might
recommend it for you--

959
00:43:57,135 --> 00:43:58,595
when you're ready.

960
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,972
I know what I have to do.

961
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:04,809
Good luck.

962
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,685
Thank you.

963
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:14,777
I'm not Curzon.
