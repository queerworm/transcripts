1
00:00:10,275 --> 00:00:11,938
You know,
if there's anything

2
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,711
I can do for you
while you're here...

3
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,550
Oh, you've already
been helpful.

4
00:00:15,588 --> 00:00:16,955
Just hearing about Dax
makes me

5
00:00:16,992 --> 00:00:18,986
a little less nervous
about the whole thing.

6
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:20,898
Really? There's no
reason to be nervous.

7
00:00:20,934 --> 00:00:22,734
Jadzia will be
a wonderful host...

8
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:24,435
Well, that is, she is
a wonderful host

9
00:00:24,476 --> 00:00:25,775
in a Trill manner
of speaking.

10
00:00:25,813 --> 00:00:27,476
I'm sure you'll learn
a lot from her.

11
00:00:27,516 --> 00:00:28,746
She sounds very different

12
00:00:28,786 --> 00:00:30,551
from the other Daxes
I have heard about.

13
00:00:30,591 --> 00:00:31,559
In what fashion?

14
00:00:31,593 --> 00:00:32,652
Let me put it this way.

15
00:00:32,696 --> 00:00:34,131
When I was told
that Jadzia Dax

16
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:35,795
had been designated
my field docent

17
00:00:35,837 --> 00:00:37,933
I asked for reassignment.

18
00:00:37,975 --> 00:00:39,376
You're joking!

19
00:00:39,412 --> 00:00:40,642
Why?

20
00:00:40,682 --> 00:00:43,587
Because Dax is famous
for breaking initiates.

21
00:00:43,622 --> 00:00:44,955
Breaking them?

22
00:00:44,992 --> 00:00:47,259
I looked up the records.

23
00:00:47,364 --> 00:00:49,426
Over the past 200 years

24
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:51,736
Dax has personally
eliminated

25
00:00:51,775 --> 00:00:54,110
57 host candidates
from the program.

26
00:00:54,148 --> 00:00:58,113
I suppose it's too late
to introduce myself to her.

27
00:00:58,157 --> 00:00:59,820
Too late?
I doubt it.

28
00:00:59,861 --> 00:01:01,455
Jadzia's a night owl.

29
00:01:01,498 --> 00:01:03,594
Computer,
locate Lieutenant Dax.

30
00:01:03,637 --> 00:01:06,667
Lieutenant Dax is on
Level 7, Section 5.

31
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:07,906
Ah, of course.

32
00:01:07,947 --> 00:01:10,977
Then take us
to Level 7, Section 5.

33
00:01:11,021 --> 00:01:12,889
That's the computer's way

34
00:01:12,926 --> 00:01:15,193
of telling us
she's in Quark's.

35
00:01:17,403 --> 00:01:19,237
Over 5,000 candidates

36
00:01:19,274 --> 00:01:22,008
qualify for the training
program each year.

37
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:25,146
Only 300 symbionts are
available on the average.

38
00:01:25,188 --> 00:01:27,284
It doesn't take much
for one of us

39
00:01:27,393 --> 00:01:29,193
to get knocked out
of consideration.

40
00:01:29,232 --> 00:01:31,533
The administrators only
want hosts who are...

41
00:01:32,673 --> 00:01:33,937
Acquire!

42
00:01:33,976 --> 00:01:35,445
Confront!

43
00:01:38,554 --> 00:01:41,322
...the best and the brightest.

44
00:01:41,394 --> 00:01:42,863
It's the ears!

45
00:01:42,898 --> 00:01:44,801
Every time
he goes to acquire

46
00:01:44,836 --> 00:01:47,707
he scratches behind
his left ear, like this.

47
00:01:47,743 --> 00:01:49,337
Don't play with my ears...

48
00:01:49,446 --> 00:01:51,542
unless you're
serious about it.

49
00:01:52,554 --> 00:01:53,613
Jadzia...

50
00:01:53,657 --> 00:01:55,058
you have a guest.

51
00:01:55,093 --> 00:01:57,725
Oh, you're not supposed
to be here till tomorrow.

52
00:01:57,767 --> 00:01:59,259
Yes, ma'am.

53
00:01:59,304 --> 00:02:01,741
I caught a transport from
Starbase 41 a day early.

54
00:02:01,776 --> 00:02:02,938
We found ourselves
sitting

55
00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:04,608
next to each other
on the way here.

56
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:07,120
I've been telling
Arjin all about you.

57
00:02:07,156 --> 00:02:08,318
Really?

58
00:02:08,358 --> 00:02:10,420
Well, not quite all about you.

59
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,126
Do you play <i>tongo,</i> Arjin?

60
00:02:12,168 --> 00:02:13,933
<i>Tongo?</i>

61
00:02:13,972 --> 00:02:15,134
No, sir.

62
00:02:15,175 --> 00:02:18,012
Then you'll have
to leave, Arjin.

63
00:02:18,048 --> 00:02:20,019
The risk's to you,
Lieutenant.

64
00:02:20,053 --> 00:02:21,956
Shame on you, Quark.

65
00:02:21,992 --> 00:02:23,359
Where are your manners?

66
00:02:23,394 --> 00:02:25,456
This is a Trill initiate
you're speaking to.

67
00:02:25,499 --> 00:02:27,470
Of course he doesn't
play <i>tongo.</i>

68
00:02:28,707 --> 00:02:29,937
I beg your pardon.

69
00:02:29,977 --> 00:02:31,811
So, we'll have to teach him.

70
00:02:31,848 --> 00:02:34,046
Actually, it is
very easy to learn.

71
00:02:34,086 --> 00:02:36,523
How much money did
you bring with you?

72
00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:38,393
Give the young fellow
a seat.

73
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,729
You, out!

74
00:02:39,767 --> 00:02:41,259
It was a very long trip.

75
00:02:41,304 --> 00:02:43,001
I think perhaps
I should...

76
00:02:43,042 --> 00:02:44,807
Oh, of course,
you're tired.

77
00:02:44,845 --> 00:02:46,816
I'll take you
to your quarters.

78
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,217
Roll me away, fellows.

79
00:02:48,254 --> 00:02:49,587
We can't roll you away.

80
00:02:49,624 --> 00:02:50,957
They're sore losers.

81
00:02:50,994 --> 00:02:54,264
You can't quit now.
You just won!

82
00:02:54,302 --> 00:02:56,466
Female!

83
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:16,281
Yes?

84
00:05:16,318 --> 00:05:17,981
Oh... I'm sorry.

85
00:05:18,022 --> 00:05:21,326
I thought this was
Lieutenant Dax's quarters.

86
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,596
She's in the shower.

87
00:05:23,635 --> 00:05:25,902
Oh... well, uh,
in that case...

88
00:05:25,941 --> 00:05:27,706
Is she expecting you?

89
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:29,408
Yes, my name is Arjin.

90
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,717
She told me I should
be here at 0800...

91
00:05:31,755 --> 00:05:33,019
Is that Arjin?

92
00:05:33,058 --> 00:05:34,493
You're early again, Arjin.

93
00:05:34,528 --> 00:05:36,191
We're going to have
to work on that.

94
00:05:36,299 --> 00:05:37,563
I can come back.

95
00:05:37,602 --> 00:05:39,037
Don't be silly.
Come in.

96
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,507
I'll only be a minute.

97
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:42,843
It always takes me longer
to get ready as a female.

98
00:05:42,881 --> 00:05:44,077
I have to go.

99
00:05:44,118 --> 00:05:46,089
I have to be at Caledonia IV
by tomorrow.

100
00:05:46,123 --> 00:05:47,615
When's my rematch?

101
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,220
Oh, I'll be back next week.

102
00:05:49,297 --> 00:05:52,703
It was fun.
Brutal, but fun.

103
00:05:52,738 --> 00:05:54,230
Safe trip!

104
00:05:54,275 --> 00:05:57,112
The replicator makes
a decent citrus blend.

105
00:05:57,149 --> 00:06:00,247
Thanks, but I've already
had something to eat.

106
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:02,021
Would you get me a Black Hole?

107
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:03,428
A what?

108
00:06:03,464 --> 00:06:05,935
A Black Hole...
it's a Ferengi drink.

109
00:06:05,971 --> 00:06:09,412
A bartender I've known
for a hundred years

110
00:06:09,446 --> 00:06:11,349
introduced it to Curzon.

111
00:06:11,383 --> 00:06:12,647
Or was it Lela?

112
00:06:12,686 --> 00:06:14,121
Well, it was ages ago.

113
00:06:14,156 --> 00:06:15,921
Try one.
You might like it.

114
00:06:15,961 --> 00:06:18,159
Computer, black hole.

115
00:06:20,238 --> 00:06:21,969
Oh, my muscles
are so sore.

116
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:23,877
Did you ever wrestle

117
00:06:23,913 --> 00:06:26,248
Galeo-Manada style,
Arjin?

118
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:27,251
Wrestle?

119
00:06:27,355 --> 00:06:28,414
You should.

120
00:06:28,457 --> 00:06:30,086
It's a great way
to start the day.

121
00:06:30,128 --> 00:06:31,427
It makes you more alert.

122
00:06:31,464 --> 00:06:33,024
I'll set you up with Trajok.

123
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:34,629
He's a great coach.

124
00:06:34,672 --> 00:06:36,666
Okay.

125
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,679
Mmm... better.

126
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,691
So, you don't play <i>tongo...</i>

127
00:06:42,725 --> 00:06:44,058
you don't wrestle.

128
00:06:44,095 --> 00:06:46,532
What are we going
to do while you're here?

129
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:48,595
Well, I was
under the impression

130
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,268
that field training
consisted of...

131
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,836
I know all about
field training.

132
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,580
Jadzia went through it
a few years ago.

133
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,214
Yes, ma'am.

134
00:06:57,627 --> 00:07:00,600
Arjin, if you truly want
to become a Trill host someday

135
00:07:00,634 --> 00:07:02,764
you'll never call me
"ma'am" again.

136
00:07:02,806 --> 00:07:05,073
Yes... Lieutenant.

137
00:07:06,515 --> 00:07:08,645
Why don't you try "Jadzia"?

138
00:07:10,725 --> 00:07:12,958
If you think
that's appropriate.

139
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,732
Oh, I'm sure it isn't
appropriate at all.

140
00:07:17,775 --> 00:07:20,543
But then, I hate
to be appropriate.

141
00:07:30,238 --> 00:07:31,935
Nothing!

142
00:07:34,616 --> 00:07:36,142
Ah!

143
00:07:36,187 --> 00:07:38,090
Over here, Chief.

144
00:07:53,394 --> 00:07:55,831
No.

145
00:07:55,866 --> 00:07:58,771
All right, come to Papa.

146
00:07:58,807 --> 00:08:00,937
Major?

147
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:02,471
Voles, sir.

148
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:03,815
Voles?

149
00:08:03,852 --> 00:08:05,948
A Cardassian legacy.

150
00:08:05,991 --> 00:08:07,358
They weren't bothering us

151
00:08:07,394 --> 00:08:10,128
till we started moving
into areas of the station

152
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:11,796
that they've been hiding in.

153
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,872
Now they're spreading
out all over the place.

154
00:08:15,914 --> 00:08:20,220
They seem to be attracted
to electromagnetic fields.

155
00:08:20,258 --> 00:08:22,252
Give me a hand,
Major, will you?

156
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,771
Phasers on stun,
Mr. O'Brien.

157
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:28,972
I want those voles taken alive.

158
00:08:29,013 --> 00:08:30,984
Benjamin, I'd like
you to meet Arjin

159
00:08:31,017 --> 00:08:33,181
the host candidate
I told you about.

160
00:08:33,223 --> 00:08:34,658
Commander Benjamin Sisko.

161
00:08:34,694 --> 00:08:35,822
Sir.

162
00:08:35,862 --> 00:08:37,388
And that's our First Officer

163
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,099
Major Kira,
and Chief Engineer O'Brien

164
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:42,110
conducting repairs?

165
00:08:42,144 --> 00:08:44,240
Chasing Cardassian voles.

166
00:08:44,283 --> 00:08:45,445
Really?

167
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,581
I've never seen
a Cardassian vole.

168
00:08:47,624 --> 00:08:48,854
Oh...

169
00:08:48,893 --> 00:08:50,385
be my guest.

170
00:08:53,338 --> 00:08:56,311
So, you're the one
who picked the black marble.

171
00:08:56,345 --> 00:08:57,370
Sir?

172
00:08:57,414 --> 00:08:58,849
Field training with Dax

173
00:08:58,884 --> 00:09:01,048
was the nightmare
of the initiate corps.

174
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:02,456
That was Curzon Dax.

175
00:09:03,462 --> 00:09:04,430
Gotcha!

176
00:09:04,464 --> 00:09:06,332
Arjin, here.

177
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:24,912
Spectacular, isn't it?

178
00:09:24,947 --> 00:09:27,545
Uh... it's amazing.

179
00:09:36,441 --> 00:09:38,674
Computer, play something
by Frenchotte.

180
00:09:38,713 --> 00:09:39,772
Frenchotte?

181
00:09:39,816 --> 00:09:41,376
A self-exiled Romulan.

182
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,946
I collect forgotten composers.

183
00:09:44,193 --> 00:09:46,027
You feel like taking
the controls?

184
00:09:46,064 --> 00:09:48,297
I've never flown
a Federation runabout before.

185
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,137
These things practically
fly themselves.

186
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:53,444
You have third-level
flight experience, don't you?

187
00:09:53,482 --> 00:09:56,854
Actually, I just finished
my fifth level last month.

188
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:59,259
Fifth! I didn't
finish third until...

189
00:09:59,296 --> 00:10:00,993
Your last year of training.

190
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,970
You've been studying up
on me, Arjin.

191
00:10:03,005 --> 00:10:04,999
Well, I can't say
that I blame you.

192
00:10:05,043 --> 00:10:07,139
I did the same thing
when I found out

193
00:10:07,181 --> 00:10:09,277
who my field docent
was going to be.

194
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,849
And how did you feel
when you found out

195
00:10:11,892 --> 00:10:13,521
it was going to be
Curzon Dax?

196
00:10:13,564 --> 00:10:17,061
"Nauseous" might be
the best description.

197
00:10:17,105 --> 00:10:20,546
I suppose it wouldn't be fair
for you to give me a few tips.

198
00:10:20,581 --> 00:10:22,016
Tips?

199
00:10:22,051 --> 00:10:24,386
On how you managed
to impress him.

200
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:26,894
Look, let's get
one thing straight.

201
00:10:26,928 --> 00:10:29,901
I'm not Curzon or Lela
or any of the others.

202
00:10:29,936 --> 00:10:31,428
I'm Jadzia Dax.

203
00:10:31,473 --> 00:10:33,967
Jadzia is only a few years
older than you are.

204
00:10:34,012 --> 00:10:36,644
You're her first initiate.

205
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,815
To be honest,
in a lot of ways

206
00:10:38,857 --> 00:10:41,386
I still feel
like an initiate, myself.

207
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:44,768
I can still remember
the pressure of competition

208
00:10:44,804 --> 00:10:47,071
when Jadzia was going
through it.

209
00:10:47,111 --> 00:10:50,552
And I'm not going
to make this difficult for you.

210
00:10:50,586 --> 00:10:53,320
You don't have
to impress me, okay?

211
00:10:53,358 --> 00:10:56,890
- Okay.
- Okay.

212
00:10:56,933 --> 00:10:58,733
So, how did you?

213
00:11:00,308 --> 00:11:02,108
Impress him?

214
00:11:02,147 --> 00:11:03,548
I didn't.

215
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:07,319
Curzon recommended that my
initiate period be terminated.

216
00:11:10,499 --> 00:11:13,131
I've got it!
Engaging manual stabilizers.

217
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,904
Shutting down all engines.

218
00:11:14,944 --> 00:11:17,074
Computer,
analyze stability loss.

219
00:11:17,116 --> 00:11:19,645
Stability loss
was due to an impact

220
00:11:19,688 --> 00:11:22,091
by a subspace interphase pocket.

221
00:11:22,128 --> 00:11:23,893
Nature of interphase pocket?

222
00:11:23,932 --> 00:11:25,162
Unknown.

223
00:11:25,202 --> 00:11:27,002
Damage report.

224
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,273
Starboard nacelle
nonfunctional.

225
00:11:29,312 --> 00:11:31,806
Maximum available power
50 percent.

226
00:11:31,851 --> 00:11:34,688
Jadzia...

227
00:11:34,724 --> 00:11:37,127
you better
take a look at this.

228
00:11:40,505 --> 00:11:42,533
Looks like we
snagged something

229
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,068
from that subspace pocket.

230
00:11:44,113 --> 00:11:47,485
Computer, identify mass
on the starboard nacelle.

231
00:11:47,522 --> 00:11:49,959
Unknown.

232
00:12:04,534 --> 00:12:05,833
Maybe we could create

233
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,773
some kind of EM pathway
along the inner hull

234
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:09,210
and try to lure them
into a trap.

235
00:12:09,245 --> 00:12:10,680
Uh-huh, but how
could you do that

236
00:12:10,715 --> 00:12:12,982
without shutting down all
the other power systems?

237
00:12:13,021 --> 00:12:15,356
I can't, and it would take
days to round them all up.

238
00:12:15,393 --> 00:12:17,922
We'd have to evacuate
the station.

239
00:12:17,966 --> 00:12:20,233
The only other thing
I can come up with

240
00:12:20,338 --> 00:12:22,902
is a directional
sonic generator.

241
00:12:22,945 --> 00:12:24,939
Now, I can adjust
it to a frequency

242
00:12:24,983 --> 00:12:26,646
that'll be uncomfortable
to their ears

243
00:12:26,687 --> 00:12:28,715
and drive them
out of hiding, one at a time.

244
00:12:28,758 --> 00:12:30,421
But, at that rate,
I'll be doing this

245
00:12:30,462 --> 00:12:31,931
for the rest
of my tour of duty.

246
00:12:31,966 --> 00:12:34,837
It ran right across
a dabo table!

247
00:12:34,873 --> 00:12:36,638
How did it die?

248
00:12:36,677 --> 00:12:38,112
Get into your food?

249
00:12:39,284 --> 00:12:41,278
As landlords,
you're responsible for this.

250
00:12:41,388 --> 00:12:44,692
I expect vermin control,
or I'm going to have to...

251
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,133
Leave?
Oh, please say, "Leave."

252
00:12:47,169 --> 00:12:50,735
I'd take a Cardassian vole
over you any day.

253
00:12:52,682 --> 00:12:53,981
The girl insists
on fighting

254
00:12:54,019 --> 00:12:55,352
her latent attraction to me.

255
00:12:56,357 --> 00:12:58,760
What are you going to do
about these pests, O'Brien?

256
00:12:58,797 --> 00:13:00,198
Relax, Quark.

257
00:13:00,234 --> 00:13:01,533
We're working on something new

258
00:13:01,571 --> 00:13:03,542
that ought to make the voles
beg for mercy.

259
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:04,669
What is it?

260
00:13:04,711 --> 00:13:07,012
Well, a sonic...

261
00:13:10,191 --> 00:13:12,389
Stop!

262
00:13:16,807 --> 00:13:18,744
You all right?

263
00:13:18,778 --> 00:13:20,681
Are you all right?

264
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:21,878
What?

265
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:23,479
Chief, the <i>Mekong</i>
just came back

266
00:13:23,522 --> 00:13:24,855
through the wormhole.

267
00:13:24,892 --> 00:13:26,327
They're showing damage.

268
00:13:26,396 --> 00:13:27,558
Open a channel, Major.

269
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:28,829
Put them on screen.

270
00:13:28,869 --> 00:13:29,928
Are you all right, Dax?

271
00:13:29,971 --> 00:13:31,874
Our power reserves are gone.

272
00:13:31,909 --> 00:13:32,934
We could use a tow.

273
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:33,969
What happened?

274
00:13:34,015 --> 00:13:35,245
Not exactly sure.

275
00:13:35,284 --> 00:13:37,312
We picked up some kind
of subspace seaweed

276
00:13:37,356 --> 00:13:38,757
on our starboard nacelle.

277
00:13:38,793 --> 00:13:41,664
We couldn't get rid of it
without causing further damage.

278
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,671
You can shut down your
engines, Lieutenant.

279
00:13:43,705 --> 00:13:44,935
We'll bring you into Pad D.

280
00:13:44,974 --> 00:13:47,036
Set up a containment chamber
in the Science Lab

281
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:48,138
for me, would you, Chief?

282
00:13:48,182 --> 00:13:49,549
When we get this thing
untangled

283
00:13:49,585 --> 00:13:51,954
I'd like to study it
under controlled conditions.

284
00:13:51,991 --> 00:13:53,585
We'll need a couple of hours.

285
00:13:53,628 --> 00:13:54,824
Morning will be fine.

286
00:13:54,864 --> 00:13:56,858
That'll give Arjin and me
a little time to recoup.

287
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:58,031
Acknowledged.

288
00:13:58,073 --> 00:13:59,508
Stop by and fill me in later.

289
00:13:59,543 --> 00:14:00,568
<i>Mekong</i> out.

290
00:14:02,015 --> 00:14:04,350
Come on, I'll take
you to dinner.

291
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:19,282
<i>Ak'la bella Doo-oo</i>

292
00:14:19,323 --> 00:14:23,698
<i>bella Ak'la Doo-oo</i>

293
00:14:23,734 --> 00:14:28,143
<i>la suhm la suhm</i>

294
00:14:28,178 --> 00:14:33,145
<i>I'Kahtra la suhm...</i>

295
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:41,610
<i>Ak'la bella Doo-oo!</i>

296
00:14:44,349 --> 00:14:45,716
She taught that to me.

297
00:14:45,753 --> 00:14:47,017
Can you believe it?

298
00:14:47,056 --> 00:14:48,993
A Klingon song
I'd never heard.

299
00:14:49,028 --> 00:14:52,298
She collects
lost composers.

300
00:14:52,336 --> 00:14:54,603
<i>Ak un lach'tel?</i>

301
00:14:54,641 --> 00:14:57,239
<i>Doko, Doko,</i>
<i>un Koliay Trill.</i>

302
00:14:58,952 --> 00:15:01,618
Don't get any ideas.

303
00:15:01,658 --> 00:15:03,184
She's mine.

304
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:09,601
You haven't touched your <i>racht.</i>

305
00:15:09,644 --> 00:15:10,977
No, I have.

306
00:15:11,014 --> 00:15:12,882
It's interesting.

307
00:15:12,918 --> 00:15:15,618
No, you've moved it
around your plate

308
00:15:15,658 --> 00:15:18,563
to make it look like
you've touched it.

309
00:15:18,598 --> 00:15:21,469
I didn't have to move it.
It moved itself.

310
00:15:21,538 --> 00:15:23,805
Arjin, if this didn't
appeal to you

311
00:15:23,845 --> 00:15:25,713
why didn't you say something?

312
00:15:25,749 --> 00:15:27,720
No, it's all right.

313
00:15:27,754 --> 00:15:30,750
I wasn't really
very hungry, anyway.

314
00:15:30,794 --> 00:15:34,462
Speak up for yourself
while you're here, okay?

315
00:15:34,503 --> 00:15:36,974
I'll make a concerted effort.

316
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:43,751
So... who sponsored you
for the program?

317
00:15:43,792 --> 00:15:45,729
My father.

318
00:15:45,763 --> 00:15:47,700
Was he joined?

319
00:15:47,735 --> 00:15:51,141
No, but he had great
ambitions for his children.

320
00:15:51,177 --> 00:15:55,347
He was a pilot instructor
at the Gedana post for 40 years.

321
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:56,788
He died last year.

322
00:15:56,824 --> 00:16:00,025
I see where you got
your flight skills.

323
00:16:00,064 --> 00:16:02,262
My sister was always
his choice for joining

324
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,467
but after she got accepted
to the program

325
00:16:04,508 --> 00:16:06,034
she ran off and got married.

326
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,448
My father never
spoke to her again.

327
00:16:08,485 --> 00:16:13,191
On the day that he died,
he turned to me, and he said

328
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,258
"I'm counting on you."

329
00:16:16,805 --> 00:16:18,536
His last words to me.

330
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,773
Did he want you to enter
Starfleet after joining?

331
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:24,881
To put your flight training
to good use?

332
00:16:26,094 --> 00:16:29,660
Honestly, he couldn't care less
what I did afterwards

333
00:16:29,702 --> 00:16:31,467
as long as I became joined.

334
00:16:31,506 --> 00:16:33,841
That was his only goal.

335
00:16:33,878 --> 00:16:36,715
And what about your goals?

336
00:16:38,925 --> 00:16:42,593
There are so many possibilities
when you're joined.

337
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:44,831
I'm not sure what I'd do yet.

338
00:16:44,872 --> 00:16:46,775
I figured I'd get
a lot of guidance

339
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,804
from the symbiont,
wouldn't you say?

340
00:16:48,848 --> 00:16:51,183
Well, a symbiont's
influence is

341
00:16:51,221 --> 00:16:54,285
very strong, Arjin,
but you're the host.

342
00:16:54,328 --> 00:16:56,265
You've got to be
strong enough

343
00:16:56,299 --> 00:16:59,500
to balance that influence
with your own instincts.

344
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,345
If you can't, the symbiont
will overwhelm your personality.

345
00:17:10,867 --> 00:17:12,838
Oh, they are a nuisance,
aren't they?

346
00:17:12,872 --> 00:17:15,436
I was hoping you found
a way to deal with them.

347
00:17:15,479 --> 00:17:18,350
Federation technology
isn't up to the task, eh?

348
00:17:18,386 --> 00:17:20,151
Look, I just thought
in the interests

349
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,625
of good relations,
you might...

350
00:17:21,693 --> 00:17:24,598
You've got the station.
You've got the voles.

351
00:17:24,633 --> 00:17:28,039
By the way, their mating season
begins in about six weeks.

352
00:17:28,075 --> 00:17:29,476
Thanks for your help.

353
00:17:29,512 --> 00:17:32,644
The Federation could always
withdraw from Baj...

354
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:36,289
What's this?

355
00:17:36,329 --> 00:17:37,889
Got me.
It's from Julian.

356
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:41,202
He called it the solution
you've been looking for.

357
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:46,512
"It worked in Hamlin."

358
00:17:49,761 --> 00:17:51,492
Very funny.

359
00:17:58,815 --> 00:18:00,546
Your move.

360
00:18:00,587 --> 00:18:03,651
Your seaweed's been safely
transported to the Science Lab.

361
00:18:03,727 --> 00:18:05,458
Did you take a look at it?

362
00:18:05,499 --> 00:18:07,264
Mm-hmm.
What do you think?

363
00:18:07,303 --> 00:18:10,276
We did as much analysis
on the runabout as we could.

364
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,677
None of the
matter would scan.

365
00:18:11,713 --> 00:18:13,080
We'll do more tests tomorrow.

366
00:18:13,116 --> 00:18:16,146
How did your initiate come
through the experience?

367
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,455
Fine.

368
00:18:17,493 --> 00:18:19,156
He's a good pilot.

369
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:20,166
Uh-oh.

370
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,259
What?

371
00:18:21,303 --> 00:18:22,328
I know that look.

372
00:18:22,372 --> 00:18:23,966
What look?

373
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:25,569
That look, old man.

374
00:18:25,613 --> 00:18:26,707
The one that says

375
00:18:26,782 --> 00:18:29,049
"This one isn't
going to make it."

376
00:18:29,089 --> 00:18:31,322
Not because of me.

377
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:33,457
But you have your doubts.

378
00:18:33,499 --> 00:18:34,729
I have my doubts.

379
00:18:34,802 --> 00:18:35,964
What is his problem?

380
00:18:36,004 --> 00:18:38,100
I'm not sure what
he brings as a host

381
00:18:38,143 --> 00:18:41,310
how he'll advance a symbiont
to the next level.

382
00:18:41,351 --> 00:18:43,949
Frankly, he's more than
a little arrogant, Benjamin.

383
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,323
Is he?

384
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,331
Okay, for a Trill,
that's to be expected.

385
00:18:47,365 --> 00:18:49,598
Check. But he's riding
his father's ambitions

386
00:18:49,637 --> 00:18:51,038
and he doesn't have any idea

387
00:18:51,074 --> 00:18:53,272
what he'd do with a symbiont
if he got one.

388
00:18:53,312 --> 00:18:55,442
Have you confronted him?

389
00:18:55,484 --> 00:18:58,389
It's not my job
to confront him.

390
00:18:58,426 --> 00:19:00,488
Isn't it?

391
00:19:00,531 --> 00:19:02,695
My job is to show him
what it's like

392
00:19:02,736 --> 00:19:05,402
to function as a joined
Trill... that's all.

393
00:19:05,442 --> 00:19:07,310
I can show you
the guidelines.

394
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:08,542
They're very clear.

395
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:09,651
Mm-hmm.

396
00:19:12,391 --> 00:19:14,122
Who am I to confront him?

397
00:19:16,868 --> 00:19:18,235
You're Dax.

398
00:19:18,271 --> 00:19:20,903
Yes, but I'm not Curzon Dax

399
00:19:20,945 --> 00:19:25,354
and I won't do to him
what Curzon did to me.

400
00:19:25,388 --> 00:19:28,384
So...

401
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,264
what are you going to do?

402
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:34,942
This kid has
to measure up soon

403
00:19:34,979 --> 00:19:37,416
or he'll never be chosen.

404
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:40,284
True?

405
00:19:40,324 --> 00:19:42,557
So, you're not
doing him any favors

406
00:19:42,596 --> 00:19:45,067
by avoiding
a confrontation, are you?

407
00:19:45,103 --> 00:19:48,737
Curzon was tough...

408
00:19:48,778 --> 00:19:51,910
maybe even abusive
in his own charming way...

409
00:19:51,952 --> 00:19:53,478
but he always demanded

410
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:56,084
the highest standards
of excellence

411
00:19:56,129 --> 00:19:58,123
from these host candidates.

412
00:19:58,167 --> 00:20:00,468
You don't know
what he did to me.

413
00:20:00,506 --> 00:20:02,704
I know you made it
through the program.

414
00:20:04,282 --> 00:20:05,911
No thanks to him.

415
00:20:05,952 --> 00:20:08,253
Are you sure?

416
00:20:46,115 --> 00:20:48,586
Voles have eaten through the
security field's energy lines.

417
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:51,356
No telling how long it will
take me to set up another field.

418
00:20:51,395 --> 00:20:53,993
So, nothing is secure
on this station anymore?

419
00:20:54,034 --> 00:20:55,367
Is there any reason
to believe

420
00:20:55,404 --> 00:20:57,067
there's an imminent threat
from this?

421
00:20:57,108 --> 00:20:59,774
Not as far as I can tell,
but I can't tell you a lot yet.

422
00:20:59,815 --> 00:21:01,580
I want to know
what we're dealing with

423
00:21:01,686 --> 00:21:03,053
as soon as possible.

424
00:21:03,089 --> 00:21:05,322
I'll schedule
a briefing for 1400 hours.

425
00:21:05,361 --> 00:21:07,491
And take those phasers
off stun, Chief!

426
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:09,298
No more Mr. Nice Guy.

427
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,238
Arjin, how's your
astrophysics profile?

428
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,342
It's one
of my better subjects.

429
00:21:15,385 --> 00:21:18,757
Maybe that's why I was
sent here to work with you.

430
00:21:18,794 --> 00:21:21,163
Set me up
a gravimetric microprobe.

431
00:21:21,199 --> 00:21:24,195
I need to calibrate
the energy profile.

432
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,539
Jadzia...

433
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:27,570
I felt that last night

434
00:21:27,615 --> 00:21:30,782
maybe I didn't express myself
well about my own goals.

435
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:33,660
I think you expressed
yourself very clearly.

436
00:21:33,696 --> 00:21:35,496
I just didn't want you
to think

437
00:21:35,533 --> 00:21:37,766
that I hadn't set any
goals for post-joining.

438
00:21:37,805 --> 00:21:39,776
I have thought
about Starfleet.

439
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:42,977
With my flight training,
it would be a perfect...

440
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:45,583
Starfleet is a career.
A pilot is a job.

441
00:21:45,624 --> 00:21:48,461
What does that have to do
with being joined?

442
00:21:48,498 --> 00:21:50,696
I'm not sure I understand.

443
00:21:50,736 --> 00:21:52,707
No, I don't think you do.

444
00:21:52,808 --> 00:21:54,072
I'm sorry?

445
00:21:54,111 --> 00:21:57,084
I think you're telling me
what I want to hear.

446
00:21:57,118 --> 00:21:58,417
That's not true.

447
00:21:58,455 --> 00:22:01,223
I think you went to your
quarters last night

448
00:22:01,262 --> 00:22:03,290
and you tossed
and turned in bed

449
00:22:03,334 --> 00:22:05,805
because you knew
some of the things

450
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,834
you said to me concerned me.

451
00:22:07,877 --> 00:22:09,574
And now you're
trying to fix it.

452
00:22:09,615 --> 00:22:11,779
I'm... I'm just
trying to clarify...

453
00:22:11,821 --> 00:22:13,085
I know what it's like.

454
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:14,889
I've tossed and turned myself.

455
00:22:14,928 --> 00:22:17,126
Please don't insult me
by denying it.

456
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:21,905
I'm finished.

457
00:22:21,945 --> 00:22:25,009
Let's run a phase
variant analysis.

458
00:22:29,162 --> 00:22:32,260
I'm worried about you, Arjin.

459
00:22:32,303 --> 00:22:34,604
Worried?

460
00:22:34,642 --> 00:22:36,943
I'm worried you're not
preparing yourself

461
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,416
for being joined.

462
00:22:38,451 --> 00:22:39,750
That's it?

463
00:22:39,854 --> 00:22:42,759
A day and a half,
and you've made up your mind.

464
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,228
I didn't say that.

465
00:22:44,265 --> 00:22:46,202
Look, you've gotten this far

466
00:22:46,236 --> 00:22:49,004
by anticipating every demand
of the program

467
00:22:49,043 --> 00:22:52,779
and performing above everyone's
expectations, am I right?

468
00:22:52,819 --> 00:22:55,758
I'd like to think that's true.

469
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:58,424
And I'm telling you,
from this point on

470
00:22:58,466 --> 00:23:00,869
that's not going to be
good enough.

471
00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:05,510
Highly structured, but it
doesn't seem to conform

472
00:23:05,549 --> 00:23:07,452
to any of our physical laws.

473
00:23:07,488 --> 00:23:10,427
Computer, run a spectral line
profile analysis.

474
00:23:10,461 --> 00:23:14,631
Spectral analysis will take
approximately seven minutes.

475
00:23:14,671 --> 00:23:17,769
Just to... speak up for myself

476
00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:21,479
I'm feeling
a little betrayed here.

477
00:23:21,521 --> 00:23:23,583
I mean, after your impassioned

478
00:23:23,626 --> 00:23:27,499
"I am Jadzia, fellow initiate"
speech in the runabout...

479
00:23:27,536 --> 00:23:29,939
I understand
why you feel that way

480
00:23:29,974 --> 00:23:31,443
but this isn't about me.

481
00:23:31,478 --> 00:23:34,178
This is about the standards
for Trill hosts.

482
00:23:34,218 --> 00:23:36,986
The opportunity is too rare
and too important

483
00:23:37,025 --> 00:23:39,087
to waste on the wrong candidate.

484
00:23:41,068 --> 00:23:45,808
And in your mind,
I'm a wrong candidate.

485
00:23:45,845 --> 00:23:47,542
I don't know that yet.

486
00:23:47,584 --> 00:23:52,585
But I felt it only fair to let
you know I am worried about you.

487
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,762
I see.

488
00:23:58,443 --> 00:24:01,007
I should have known this.

489
00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:03,817
I should have realized this.

490
00:24:03,889 --> 00:24:06,360
You're Dax.

491
00:24:06,395 --> 00:24:09,699
"Standards for Trill hosts"?

492
00:24:09,737 --> 00:24:12,608
That is really incredible
coming from you.

493
00:24:12,644 --> 00:24:15,138
I have never seen
any host in my life

494
00:24:15,182 --> 00:24:18,953
who is so far below those
standards as you are, ma'am.

495
00:24:20,262 --> 00:24:24,432
No wonder Curzon Dax tried
to terminate your training.

496
00:24:39,608 --> 00:24:41,545
I was finally able to read
the EM flux.

497
00:24:41,579 --> 00:24:43,310
There are high plasma
concentrations

498
00:24:43,351 --> 00:24:44,752
in a rapidly-expanding mass.

499
00:24:44,787 --> 00:24:45,755
How rapidly?

500
00:24:45,789 --> 00:24:47,019
The energy buildup

501
00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:49,394
is already straining
the containment chamber.

502
00:24:49,431 --> 00:24:51,459
On top of that, the mass
periodically undergoes

503
00:24:51,503 --> 00:24:55,239
phased expansions,
and grows in spurts.

504
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:57,181
It's a very specific
growth pattern

505
00:24:57,217 --> 00:24:58,777
that the computer recognized.

506
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,551
Recognized as what?

507
00:25:00,592 --> 00:25:02,790
The expansion patterns
of a universe.

508
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:03,798
What?

509
00:25:03,832 --> 00:25:05,894
A universe?

510
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:08,842
What we have here, Benjamin,
is a protouniverse

511
00:25:08,878 --> 00:25:11,008
in its earliest stages
of formation.

512
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,644
Unfortunately, as it grows

513
00:25:12,687 --> 00:25:14,749
it's displacing
our own universe.

514
00:25:14,793 --> 00:25:17,230
Can we get it back
where it came from?

515
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:19,429
This has turned
into an energy mass

516
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,600
with properties
that don't conform

517
00:25:21,642 --> 00:25:23,043
to our own laws of nature.

518
00:25:23,078 --> 00:25:24,946
I have no idea
what might happen

519
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:26,384
if we tried to move it

520
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,516
let alone take it back
into the wormhole.

521
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,261
Even if we get it there,
the wormhole's verteron nodes

522
00:25:32,301 --> 00:25:34,795
would probably interact
with the energy fluctuations

523
00:25:34,841 --> 00:25:37,973
of the protouniverse,
causing a devastating reaction.

524
00:25:38,081 --> 00:25:40,211
It could threaten
this whole system.

525
00:25:40,253 --> 00:25:41,517
And if we don't do anything

526
00:25:41,556 --> 00:25:43,993
it'll eventually obliterate
this system, and beyond.

527
00:25:44,029 --> 00:25:45,897
Can't we contain it somehow?

528
00:25:45,933 --> 00:25:47,961
Not without destroying it.

529
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:49,474
Under the circumstances

530
00:25:49,509 --> 00:25:51,810
that sounds like
a pretty good option to me.

531
00:25:51,848 --> 00:25:53,910
We can create a force field
that will contain it.

532
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:55,319
If we can suppress it
long enough

533
00:25:55,356 --> 00:25:57,691
the feedback pressure should
create an implosive wave.

534
00:25:57,729 --> 00:25:59,164
It would self-destruct.

535
00:25:59,199 --> 00:26:01,933
How long before
the next phase of expansion?

536
00:26:01,972 --> 00:26:03,407
About three hours.

537
00:26:03,442 --> 00:26:07,281
The collateral shock waves
will probably destroy the lab.

538
00:26:07,318 --> 00:26:10,416
Can we get this containment
field ready by then?

539
00:26:10,459 --> 00:26:12,156
Yes, sir.

540
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:14,633
Have Odo evacuate Section 14.

541
00:26:14,669 --> 00:26:16,332
Dismissed.

542
00:26:25,529 --> 00:26:26,497
Ah...

543
00:26:26,531 --> 00:26:28,331
Another?

544
00:26:28,369 --> 00:26:30,340
Just keep pouring
until I drown.

545
00:26:30,373 --> 00:26:31,842
Sounds pretty serious.

546
00:26:31,877 --> 00:26:32,845
Serious?

547
00:26:32,879 --> 00:26:34,041
No.

548
00:26:34,116 --> 00:26:36,680
I just threw my whole life
out a porthole...

549
00:26:36,722 --> 00:26:37,850
nothing serious.

550
00:26:37,891 --> 00:26:39,417
There isn't a problem
in the world

551
00:26:39,462 --> 00:26:41,865
that can't be fixed
by the right holosuite program.

552
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:45,342
Never trust a Trill, Quark.

553
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,366
Why not?

554
00:26:46,412 --> 00:26:48,849
They're... two-faced.

555
00:26:48,884 --> 00:26:50,012
Does that go for all Trills

556
00:26:50,054 --> 00:26:51,648
or just for the ones
with the worm?

557
00:26:52,761 --> 00:26:55,563
Any worm named Dax.

558
00:26:55,601 --> 00:26:58,733
Did she break your heart, son?

559
00:26:58,775 --> 00:26:59,834
What?

560
00:26:59,878 --> 00:27:01,108
Mine, too.

561
00:27:01,147 --> 00:27:02,981
And Bashir is in here
every other day

562
00:27:03,018 --> 00:27:04,749
crying into
his synthale over her.

563
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,884
The Promenade is littered
with the bodies...

564
00:27:05,925 --> 00:27:06,791
It wasn't my heart she broke.

565
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,194
It wasn't my heart she broke.

566
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,198
It was me.

567
00:27:10,232 --> 00:27:11,895
My career, my life...

568
00:27:11,937 --> 00:27:13,099
Wait a minute.

569
00:27:13,139 --> 00:27:15,633
Is this about
all that "initiate" stuff?

570
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,313
She told me I wasn't
preparing myself to join.

571
00:27:19,354 --> 00:27:21,484
With the worm?
So, that's her opinion.

572
00:27:21,526 --> 00:27:23,155
What's that worth, anyhow?

573
00:27:23,197 --> 00:27:24,427
A bad recommendation

574
00:27:24,467 --> 00:27:27,908
from your field docent,
and you can forget it.

575
00:27:27,942 --> 00:27:30,881
Listen, son, when I was
a young man, no older than you

576
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:34,116
I had an apprentice position
with the district sub-nagus.

577
00:27:34,157 --> 00:27:36,959
I licked his boots
like you couldn't believe.

578
00:27:36,997 --> 00:27:39,093
He loved me.
I was his golden boy.

579
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,537
I was on the high road

580
00:27:40,572 --> 00:27:43,043
to the top of the Ferengi
business world

581
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,809
and then, it all fell apart.

582
00:27:44,849 --> 00:27:47,047
How?

583
00:27:47,088 --> 00:27:48,717
Rule of Acquisition 112:

584
00:27:48,758 --> 00:27:51,458
"Never have sex
with the boss' sister."

585
00:27:52,835 --> 00:27:55,467
I was fired, broke.

586
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,944
It was quite a setback
to my ambitions.

587
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,509
Well... how did you recover?

588
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:01,521
Never did.

589
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:02,650
Look at me...

590
00:28:02,691 --> 00:28:05,289
tending bar out here
in wormhole junction

591
00:28:05,331 --> 00:28:08,099
while the big boys
fly by me at warp speed.

592
00:28:08,138 --> 00:28:12,274
You only get one shot
at the latinum stairway.

593
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:15,949
If you miss it, you miss it.

594
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,827
Welcome to the club, son.

595
00:28:21,503 --> 00:28:22,972
Well... thanks.

596
00:28:23,007 --> 00:28:25,673
Glad I could help.

597
00:28:42,553 --> 00:28:45,024
Computer, confirm
the localized entropy decrease

598
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,359
in the energy mass.

599
00:28:46,397 --> 00:28:47,696
Confirmed.

600
00:28:47,732 --> 00:28:50,101
How much have the readings
decreased in the last hour?

601
00:28:50,139 --> 00:28:53,078
Localized entropy readings
have decreased 12 percent

602
00:28:53,112 --> 00:28:54,877
during the last 58 minutes.

603
00:28:54,916 --> 00:28:56,215
This can't be right.

604
00:28:56,253 --> 00:28:58,451
The whole thermodynamic
structure

605
00:28:58,491 --> 00:29:00,188
would have to be changing.

606
00:29:00,229 --> 00:29:02,097
Activate a quantometer probe.

607
00:29:02,134 --> 00:29:05,005
Verify filter calibration.

608
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:07,103
Filter calibration verified.

609
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:11,248
Set energy flux resolution
to.1 microdyne.

610
00:29:11,289 --> 00:29:14,627
Begin high-resolution
energy scans.

611
00:29:14,664 --> 00:29:18,298
There must be a malfunction
in the sensors.

612
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,333
Computer, run
a self-diagnostic

613
00:29:20,378 --> 00:29:22,508
and check
quantometer calibration.

614
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:24,645
Calibration is locked
and normal.

615
00:29:24,688 --> 00:29:26,123
Diagnostic underway.

616
00:29:26,158 --> 00:29:29,222
Are there any feedback anomalies
in the dynametric array?

617
00:29:29,266 --> 00:29:30,735
Negative.

618
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,741
What's the feedback reading?

619
00:29:32,774 --> 00:29:34,608
Feedback reading is zero.

620
00:29:34,645 --> 00:29:36,137
Diagnostic complete.

621
00:29:36,182 --> 00:29:38,619
Sensors are
functioning normally.

622
00:29:41,762 --> 00:29:43,254
Odo to Sisko.

623
00:29:43,299 --> 00:29:44,267
Yes, Odo?

624
00:29:44,302 --> 00:29:46,432
Section 14 has been evacuated.

625
00:29:46,474 --> 00:29:47,442
Acknowledged.

626
00:29:47,476 --> 00:29:48,444
Mr. O'Brien?

627
00:29:48,478 --> 00:29:49,947
Just finishing, Commander.

628
00:29:49,981 --> 00:29:50,949
Sisko to Dax.

629
00:29:50,984 --> 00:29:53,319
We're preparing to establish
the containment field.

630
00:29:53,356 --> 00:29:54,985
I want you out of the lab
during this.

631
00:29:55,061 --> 00:29:56,394
I'm already out, Benjamin

632
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,628
but I'm not sure you're going
to want to do this now.

633
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,573
Why not?

634
00:30:00,607 --> 00:30:03,808
I found indications of life
in the protouniverse.

635
00:30:10,498 --> 00:30:13,164
Non-random thermodynamics...

636
00:30:13,204 --> 00:30:15,802
irregular power consumption.

637
00:30:15,844 --> 00:30:18,681
The computer's confirmed it.
These are life signs.

638
00:30:18,718 --> 00:30:19,914
Now, wait a minute.

639
00:30:19,953 --> 00:30:21,947
Single-cell microbes
are life-forms, too

640
00:30:21,992 --> 00:30:24,463
but Dr. Bashir has
a hypospray that'll kill them

641
00:30:24,498 --> 00:30:26,263
to say nothing of the voles.

642
00:30:26,302 --> 00:30:27,430
Kira, we could very well

643
00:30:27,472 --> 00:30:29,272
be dealing with
intelligent life here.

644
00:30:29,309 --> 00:30:30,642
Well, how is that possible?

645
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:32,877
You told us that this
protouniverse was just formed.

646
00:30:32,918 --> 00:30:33,908
It's quite possible.

647
00:30:33,954 --> 00:30:35,355
We may have
only experienced hours

648
00:30:35,391 --> 00:30:37,225
since this universe
was formed

649
00:30:37,262 --> 00:30:38,629
but there's
no way of knowing

650
00:30:38,666 --> 00:30:40,226
how fast time
is moving for them.

651
00:30:40,269 --> 00:30:41,363
Theoretically

652
00:30:41,405 --> 00:30:43,068
billions of years
may have passed.

653
00:30:43,109 --> 00:30:44,578
An entire evolution
of a species

654
00:30:44,613 --> 00:30:46,914
might have taken place
within the last few hours.

655
00:30:46,952 --> 00:30:48,080
It's possible.

656
00:30:48,121 --> 00:30:49,283
O'Brien to Sisko.

657
00:30:49,324 --> 00:30:50,657
Go ahead, Chief.

658
00:30:50,694 --> 00:30:52,129
Commander,
if we're going to implement

659
00:30:52,231 --> 00:30:53,996
that containment field,
we'd better do it now.

660
00:30:54,035 --> 00:30:55,835
In two minutes,
this thing's going to expand.

661
00:30:55,873 --> 00:30:57,308
Get your people
out of there, Chief.

662
00:30:57,344 --> 00:30:59,315
We're not going to put up
the containment field.

663
00:30:59,348 --> 00:31:00,316
Aye, sir.

664
00:31:00,351 --> 00:31:03,222
Commander, this is only
going to delay the inevitable.

665
00:31:03,258 --> 00:31:04,659
Take us to Yellow Alert, Major.

666
00:31:04,694 --> 00:31:06,597
Move the repair
crews into position.

667
00:31:19,897 --> 00:31:23,599
Warning, hull breach.
Level 22, Section 14.

668
00:31:23,639 --> 00:31:24,733
Sisko to O'Brien.

669
00:31:24,776 --> 00:31:26,075
Seal off Section 14.

670
00:31:26,112 --> 00:31:27,809
Move your repair crews in.

671
00:31:27,849 --> 00:31:29,113
Aye, sir.

672
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:31,283
How long before
the next expansion?

673
00:31:31,325 --> 00:31:32,293
Roughly five hours.

674
00:31:32,328 --> 00:31:33,456
How much will it expand?

675
00:31:33,496 --> 00:31:34,590
About 300 percent.

676
00:31:34,633 --> 00:31:36,797
We'll lose a whole section
of the station.

677
00:31:36,838 --> 00:31:38,775
By tomorrow,
the station will be gone.

678
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:40,747
We could beam them into space...

679
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:43,274
give us some more time
to come up with a solution.

680
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,653
We already have a solution

681
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:45,818
and the longer we wait

682
00:31:45,859 --> 00:31:47,693
the harder it's going to be
to implement it.

683
00:31:47,731 --> 00:31:49,200
I'm sorry, but it's us or them.

684
00:31:49,234 --> 00:31:50,293
We have to destroy it.

685
00:31:50,337 --> 00:31:52,808
You can't just wipe
out a civilization.

686
00:31:52,843 --> 00:31:54,746
We'd be committing mass murder.

687
00:31:54,781 --> 00:31:57,218
It's like stepping on ants, Odo.

688
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,757
I don't step on ants, Major.

689
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:01,923
Just because we
don't understand

690
00:32:01,965 --> 00:32:05,029
a life-form, doesn't
mean we can destroy it.

691
00:32:05,072 --> 00:32:07,043
Well, do you have a better idea?

692
00:32:08,347 --> 00:32:11,149
Does anyone?

693
00:32:11,187 --> 00:32:14,183
I'll give you my decision
in an hour.

694
00:32:23,216 --> 00:32:26,018
Personal Log, supplemental.

695
00:32:26,056 --> 00:32:27,184
One hour.

696
00:32:27,225 --> 00:32:29,219
One hour to make a decision

697
00:32:29,297 --> 00:32:32,669
that could mean the life
or death of a civilization

698
00:32:32,705 --> 00:32:34,733
or the end to our own.

699
00:32:34,777 --> 00:32:38,218
My mind keeps going back
to the Borg.

700
00:32:38,252 --> 00:32:41,886
How I despised
their indifference

701
00:32:41,927 --> 00:32:44,262
as they tried
to exterminate us.

702
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:47,899
And I have to ask myself,
"Would I be any different

703
00:32:47,941 --> 00:32:52,111
if I destroyed another universe
to preserve my own?"

704
00:32:56,629 --> 00:32:58,258
Hey.

705
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,290
Hi, Dad.

706
00:32:59,335 --> 00:33:01,329
What are you doing
back so early?

707
00:33:01,374 --> 00:33:03,071
I just wanted to see you.

708
00:33:05,918 --> 00:33:07,889
He told you, didn't he?

709
00:33:07,923 --> 00:33:09,051
Told me what?

710
00:33:09,092 --> 00:33:11,461
Chief O'Brien.
Darn it, he promised.

711
00:33:11,498 --> 00:33:14,062
If there's something
you want to tell me

712
00:33:14,104 --> 00:33:15,437
I want to hear it.

713
00:33:20,787 --> 00:33:23,589
I love her, Dad.

714
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:24,926
Okay.

715
00:33:24,964 --> 00:33:27,664
She's everything I ever
wanted in a woman.

716
00:33:27,704 --> 00:33:29,766
I'm sure she's
a wonderful girl.

717
00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:32,076
Oh, she's not a girl;
she's a woman.

718
00:33:32,114 --> 00:33:34,585
She doesn't like
to be called a "girl."

719
00:33:34,621 --> 00:33:36,888
Everyone calls her that,
and she hates it.

720
00:33:36,926 --> 00:33:39,524
She wants to be something
better than that.

721
00:33:39,565 --> 00:33:40,533
Than what?

722
00:33:40,568 --> 00:33:42,094
Than a dabo girl.

723
00:33:42,138 --> 00:33:45,339
You're in love
with a dabo girl?

724
00:33:45,413 --> 00:33:46,575
Wait a minute.

725
00:33:46,615 --> 00:33:48,244
You said Chief O'Brien
told you that...

726
00:33:48,286 --> 00:33:49,482
No, I didn't.

727
00:33:49,522 --> 00:33:52,758
Who is she,
and how old is she, Jake?

728
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:53,822
Oh, geez...

729
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:55,301
I wanted to tell you

730
00:33:55,336 --> 00:33:58,138
but I was sure you
wouldn't understand.

731
00:33:58,176 --> 00:33:59,708
So now, you're hiding
things from me?

732
00:33:59,842 --> 00:34:01,106
You mean, you would
have understood?

733
00:34:01,145 --> 00:34:03,582
Of course not.

734
00:34:06,257 --> 00:34:08,786
It's Mardah, isn't it?

735
00:34:10,434 --> 00:34:13,236
The one you've been
tutoring in entomology.

736
00:34:13,274 --> 00:34:15,541
I really want you
to meet her, Dad.

737
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,243
I really want to meet her.

738
00:34:17,283 --> 00:34:20,085
Can I invite her
to dinner tonight?

739
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:22,095
No.

740
00:34:22,129 --> 00:34:24,761
Not tonight.

741
00:34:24,802 --> 00:34:26,602
But soon.

742
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,439
Thanks, Dad.

743
00:34:28,477 --> 00:34:29,810
You'll love her.

744
00:34:34,926 --> 00:34:37,455
What's so interesting
in there?

745
00:34:37,498 --> 00:34:39,127
I can see my future.

746
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:41,471
I wouldn't trust
a glass of synthale

747
00:34:41,508 --> 00:34:43,979
to tell you the future.

748
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:46,749
Let's just get this
over with, okay?

749
00:34:46,787 --> 00:34:50,023
Just use a sharp blade,
so I won't feel it.

750
00:34:50,096 --> 00:34:53,662
You don't know me as well
as you think you do.

751
00:34:53,704 --> 00:34:56,871
I'm sure you looked
at all the training profiles

752
00:34:56,912 --> 00:35:00,010
but that doesn't tell you
who Jadzia really was

753
00:35:00,053 --> 00:35:01,818
before she was joined.

754
00:35:03,495 --> 00:35:06,627
She was the quietest, shyest

755
00:35:06,668 --> 00:35:09,641
most withdrawn young woman
you've ever known.

756
00:35:09,675 --> 00:35:12,648
Brilliant...
top grades...

757
00:35:12,683 --> 00:35:15,987
and not a clue
to what life was about.

758
00:35:16,024 --> 00:35:18,656
She had never lived
outside the program

759
00:35:18,697 --> 00:35:20,030
and it didn't matter

760
00:35:20,101 --> 00:35:22,665
because she was sailing
through it.

761
00:35:22,707 --> 00:35:25,008
Until she met Curzon Dax.

762
00:35:25,046 --> 00:35:29,182
Curzon sized her up
in about 20 seconds

763
00:35:29,223 --> 00:35:33,894
and made the next two weeks
the most miserable of her life.

764
00:35:33,934 --> 00:35:37,170
She cried herself
to sleep every night.

765
00:35:37,209 --> 00:35:40,307
She hated him for it.

766
00:35:40,349 --> 00:35:42,217
But when the field
training was over

767
00:35:42,254 --> 00:35:44,657
and she learned about
Curzon's recommendation

768
00:35:44,693 --> 00:35:46,789
to terminate her
from the program

769
00:35:46,831 --> 00:35:48,961
she went back a different woman.

770
00:35:49,003 --> 00:35:51,236
She found her voice
and reapplied.

771
00:35:51,276 --> 00:35:55,343
She tore through the program
with a passion, a vengeance.

772
00:35:55,385 --> 00:35:56,547
And in the end

773
00:35:56,588 --> 00:35:59,288
the administrators
chose her for joining.

774
00:35:59,328 --> 00:36:02,028
How did you wind up
with the Dax symbiont?

775
00:36:02,068 --> 00:36:03,401
When I found out

776
00:36:03,438 --> 00:36:07,038
Curzon was dying,
I requested the Dax symbiont.

777
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,948
And Curzon didn't object?

778
00:36:08,984 --> 00:36:10,043
No.

779
00:36:10,087 --> 00:36:12,558
And I've never been sure
quite why.

780
00:36:12,593 --> 00:36:16,558
Except, as I've come to know
Curzon's dark sense of humor

781
00:36:16,603 --> 00:36:20,602
I have a feeling the irony
might have appealed to him.

782
00:36:20,646 --> 00:36:24,553
Jadzia Dax is not Curzon Dax.

783
00:36:24,588 --> 00:36:26,752
But I am Dax

784
00:36:26,794 --> 00:36:30,759
and I am slowly coming to terms
with what that means to me.

785
00:36:30,804 --> 00:36:33,436
Sometimes it means
gambling or wrestling.

786
00:36:33,477 --> 00:36:36,041
Sometimes it means
waking up an initiate

787
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:40,150
before he slides into the middle
of the pack and gets overlooked.

788
00:36:40,259 --> 00:36:43,323
You're giving me another chance?

789
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:47,103
You are the only one who can
give yourself another chance.

790
00:36:47,143 --> 00:36:49,171
You can't simply do this anymore

791
00:36:49,281 --> 00:36:51,650
to meet other people's
expectations...

792
00:36:51,687 --> 00:36:54,923
not your father's,
not your teachers', not mine.

793
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:56,431
You need to discover

794
00:36:56,465 --> 00:36:59,495
what Arjin wants out of life,
out of joining.

795
00:36:59,539 --> 00:37:00,838
Lieutenant...

796
00:37:00,876 --> 00:37:03,815
we'll try to take it back
through the wormhole.

797
00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:05,284
How soon can you be ready?

798
00:37:05,319 --> 00:37:07,313
I want to be sure
the containment field

799
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:09,659
can block out
any verteron-node radiation

800
00:37:09,696 --> 00:37:11,461
as we pass through it.

801
00:37:11,501 --> 00:37:12,526
Uh, about two hours?

802
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:14,335
Better get started.

803
00:37:15,678 --> 00:37:18,845
Wouldn't hurt to have
a level-five pilot along.

804
00:37:30,647 --> 00:37:32,207
Chief?

805
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:35,190
The containment field is
in place and holding, sir

806
00:37:35,225 --> 00:37:36,922
but I'd like to run
a practical test

807
00:37:36,962 --> 00:37:38,226
on the verteron integrity.

808
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:39,892
"Like to" or "need to"?

809
00:37:39,935 --> 00:37:41,906
That thing expands again
in less than an hour.

810
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,808
Well, this is
the strongest force field

811
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:45,212
I know
how to construct, sir.

812
00:37:45,249 --> 00:37:47,152
The test would
at least give us the odds

813
00:37:47,187 --> 00:37:49,215
of getting it through
the wormhole intact.

814
00:37:49,259 --> 00:37:50,660
I'm not playing
the odds today.

815
00:37:50,695 --> 00:37:52,221
Sisko to <i>Rio Grande.</i>
Your status?

816
00:37:52,266 --> 00:37:53,963
Systems check complete.

817
00:37:54,003 --> 00:37:55,199
Auxiliary power to shields.

818
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:57,472
I'd say we're packed and
ready to go, Benjamin.

819
00:37:57,511 --> 00:37:58,536
Ready transporter.

820
00:37:58,581 --> 00:38:00,278
Locking onto
the containment field.

821
00:38:00,318 --> 00:38:01,308
Energize.

822
00:38:03,826 --> 00:38:06,765
Chief, we're getting
a phase variation here.

823
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,394
Stand by.

824
00:38:08,437 --> 00:38:11,501
The energy fluctuations are
driving the transporter crazy.

825
00:38:13,684 --> 00:38:16,486
We've got it now.

826
00:38:16,524 --> 00:38:18,825
Switching your transporter
to secure mode.

827
00:38:18,862 --> 00:38:20,491
Readings are stable.

828
00:38:20,533 --> 00:38:21,832
When you're ready, Dax.

829
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:23,999
Take us out gently, Arjin.

830
00:38:24,041 --> 00:38:26,069
Firing thrusters.

831
00:38:31,125 --> 00:38:34,531
Energy readings from the
containment field are holding.

832
00:38:34,567 --> 00:38:36,629
Take us to 50 kph.

833
00:38:36,672 --> 00:38:39,041
Confirmed, 17 seconds
to wormhole.

834
00:38:39,077 --> 00:38:40,877
Hold at 50 kph.

835
00:38:40,915 --> 00:38:42,316
Ten seconds to the wormhole.

836
00:38:42,419 --> 00:38:44,788
Reading higher levels
of neutrino activity.

837
00:38:44,824 --> 00:38:46,555
A short cross
to the other side

838
00:38:46,596 --> 00:38:47,758
and we're home free.

839
00:38:47,798 --> 00:38:48,960
<i>Rio Grande</i> to Ops.

840
00:38:49,001 --> 00:38:51,472
Com links will terminate
in five seconds.

841
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:54,173
See you later.

842
00:38:54,213 --> 00:38:56,480
Acknowledged, <i>Rio Grande.</i>

843
00:38:58,624 --> 00:39:01,358
May the Prophets guide you.

844
00:39:10,753 --> 00:39:13,783
Containment-field stability
is down to 85 percent.

845
00:39:13,828 --> 00:39:15,628
Every time we pass through
a verteron node

846
00:39:15,665 --> 00:39:17,693
there's resonance leakage
from the energy mass.

847
00:39:17,737 --> 00:39:19,331
In 20 seconds,
we'll be out of here.

848
00:39:19,408 --> 00:39:20,341
We'll never make it.

849
00:39:20,443 --> 00:39:23,280
Field stability is down
to 65 percent and falling.

850
00:39:23,317 --> 00:39:25,345
We've got to kill
our forward acceleration now!

851
00:39:25,422 --> 00:39:27,859
All engines stop.

852
00:39:27,894 --> 00:39:31,630
38 percent stability,
still falling...

853
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:34,234
26 percent...

854
00:39:34,276 --> 00:39:38,275
Computer, thrusters on reverse,
two-second burst.

855
00:39:38,319 --> 00:39:39,948
All stop.

856
00:39:44,033 --> 00:39:46,129
It's stabilizing.

857
00:39:46,172 --> 00:39:49,236
The containment field
is at 27 percent.

858
00:39:49,279 --> 00:39:52,184
26 percent and holding.

859
00:39:59,369 --> 00:40:00,337
Now what?

860
00:40:00,372 --> 00:40:01,431
Well, we can't stay here.

861
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:04,913
In 42 minutes,
that energy mass expands.

862
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:07,684
And once it intersects
with one of those verteron nodes

863
00:40:07,723 --> 00:40:09,921
they'll feel the result
in the Cardassian home world.

864
00:40:09,962 --> 00:40:11,556
But the containment field
is so weak now

865
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,468
it will fail as soon as we start
to move again.

866
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:15,473
Then, I guess we'll just
have to let it fail.

867
00:40:15,575 --> 00:40:16,908
Let it fail?

868
00:40:16,945 --> 00:40:18,312
But you said it yourself.

869
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:21,117
If we pass through even
one of those verteron nodes

870
00:40:21,155 --> 00:40:24,459
without the containment field,
the energy mass will explode.

871
00:40:24,497 --> 00:40:26,297
Then we'll just have
to avoid them.

872
00:40:26,334 --> 00:40:28,703
You're talking
about precision flying

873
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:29,970
through a wormhole.

874
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,377
It's never been done.

875
00:40:31,413 --> 00:40:33,110
Until now.

876
00:40:33,151 --> 00:40:34,119
Jadzia...

877
00:40:34,153 --> 00:40:35,520
I'm a level-three pilot.

878
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,889
You're a level-five.

879
00:40:36,927 --> 00:40:39,525
I'll do it if I have to,
but I don't have time to argue.

880
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:43,099
Watch the conn read-outs.

881
00:40:43,142 --> 00:40:46,708
I'll try to keep at least
50 meters away from any node.

882
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:47,844
Understood.

883
00:40:47,886 --> 00:40:50,153
Computer, calibrate
internal scanners

884
00:40:50,191 --> 00:40:52,823
to detect verteron radiation
in the cabin.

885
00:40:52,864 --> 00:40:54,493
Activate sonic indicators.

886
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:57,304
Verteron levels are
well within safe limits.

887
00:40:57,342 --> 00:40:59,210
We'll start with
one short thruster blast

888
00:40:59,246 --> 00:41:00,681
and we'll coast through.

889
00:41:00,717 --> 00:41:02,983
That'll protect the containment
field for a few extra seconds.

890
00:41:03,117 --> 00:41:03,982
Thrusters ready.

891
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:05,749
I'm taking the inertial
dampers off-line.

892
00:41:05,789 --> 00:41:07,885
It'll be a rougher ride

893
00:41:07,928 --> 00:41:11,026
but it'll have
a little more response time.

894
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:12,766
Firing thrusters.

895
00:41:17,818 --> 00:41:20,416
Velocity is
at 40 meters per second.

896
00:41:20,458 --> 00:41:23,659
Warning, containment field
at 10 percent.

897
00:41:23,699 --> 00:41:25,328
60 seconds to Gamma.

898
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:29,745
Node to starboard,
bearing 037 mark 7.

899
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:32,252
Firing starboard thruster.

900
00:41:37,298 --> 00:41:38,597
Warning.

901
00:41:38,635 --> 00:41:41,233
Containment field has collapsed.

902
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,478
No more margin for error.

903
00:41:45,518 --> 00:41:47,580
45 seconds to Gamma.

904
00:41:47,623 --> 00:41:51,530
Node to port,
bearing 030 mark 51.

905
00:41:51,566 --> 00:41:53,594
I've got it.

906
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:00,118
35 seconds to Gamma.

907
00:42:00,153 --> 00:42:02,386
Verteron levels are still okay.

908
00:42:02,425 --> 00:42:05,489
Jadzia, look at this.

909
00:42:05,533 --> 00:42:08,769
We're never going
to get through it.

910
00:42:08,807 --> 00:42:10,174
Reading a passage.

911
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:13,810
Adjust heading to 130 mark 47.

912
00:42:13,852 --> 00:42:15,481
Confirmed.

913
00:42:15,524 --> 00:42:18,622
Sensors say it's directly ahead.

914
00:42:20,001 --> 00:42:21,470
I don't see it.

915
00:42:21,504 --> 00:42:23,167
Hold your course.

916
00:42:23,209 --> 00:42:24,644
I don't see it!

917
00:42:26,183 --> 00:42:27,652
I see it!

918
00:42:27,686 --> 00:42:30,250
It's less than 17 meters across.

919
00:42:30,359 --> 00:42:32,421
The ship is only 14 meters wide.

920
00:42:32,464 --> 00:42:34,935
That gives you over two meters
to work with.

921
00:42:42,354 --> 00:42:45,327
Verteron levels are red-lining.

922
00:42:47,366 --> 00:42:49,496
Five seconds to Gamma.

923
00:43:00,665 --> 00:43:04,231
This is going to look very good
on your initiate record, Arjin.

924
00:43:04,274 --> 00:43:08,945
Now, let's get this thing
back where it belongs.

925
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,100
There's one thing
I want to do before I go

926
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,700
and that is to apologize

927
00:43:19,744 --> 00:43:22,308
for the things I said
to you in the lab.

928
00:43:22,383 --> 00:43:25,481
That was the first time
you were being honest with me.

929
00:43:25,525 --> 00:43:29,057
Somehow, I always expected that
joining would make any Trill...

930
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:33,236
complete, serene,
wise beyond her years.

931
00:43:33,276 --> 00:43:35,611
And I'm none
of those things?

932
00:43:35,649 --> 00:43:39,591
What I mean is,
you're nothing like I expected.

933
00:43:39,625 --> 00:43:41,755
I'm nothing like I expected.

934
00:43:41,796 --> 00:43:44,633
Life after life...
with each new personality

935
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:46,834
stampeding around
in your head...

936
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:48,937
you get desires that scare you

937
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:51,953
dreams that used to belong
to someone else.

938
00:43:51,988 --> 00:43:54,255
I wouldn't recommend
it for everyone

939
00:43:54,294 --> 00:43:57,131
but, in time, I might
recommend it for you...

940
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:59,138
when you're ready.

941
00:43:59,172 --> 00:44:01,166
I know what I have to do.

942
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,217
Good luck.

943
00:44:05,253 --> 00:44:07,121
Thank you.

944
00:44:12,805 --> 00:44:15,432
I'm not Curzon.
