<i>Last time on</i> Deep Space Nine...

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:04,839
SISKO:
This is the emblem

3
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:06,214
of the Alliance
for Global Unity.

4
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:08,592
They call themselves
the Circle.

5
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:10,761
What gives them the right
to mess up our station?

6
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:12,554
They're an extremist faction

7
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:15,098
who believe in Bajor
for the Bajorans.

8
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,142
I can't loan you
a Starfleet runabout

9
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:19,144
without knowing
where you plan on taking it.

10
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:22,898
To Cardassia IV to rescue
a Bajoran prisoner of war.

11
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,569
Come on.

12
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:29,655
We have a ship waiting.

13
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:33,534
What you did today, Major,
was declare war on Cardassia.

14
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:35,410
Thankfully, they declined
the invitation.

15
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,746
What if I told you
that I knew someone

16
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,748
who could bring
stability to Bajor?

17
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:42,041
Someone who could
unite the factions

18
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,711
and give us a chance
to do our job?

19
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:46,672
Bajor doesn't
need a man.

20
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:51,010
It needs a symbol,
and that's what you are.

21
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,179
The Navarch needed to return
here to assume his new post.

22
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:57,599
He's been made the Bajoran
Liaison Officer to Deep Space 9.

23
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:00,268
I already have
a liaison officer.

24
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:01,770
JARO:
Not anymore
you don't.

25
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,356
Major Kira is no longer
assigned to this post.

26
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:06,942
She's been recalled to Bajor.

27
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:10,278
<i>And now, the continuation.</i>

28
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:20,539
Frankly, Commander,
I'm surprised at your reaction.

29
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:25,419
Oh, I don't think much
surprises you, Minister.

30
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:29,006
But I was expecting you
to be celebrating.

31
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:30,257
I was under the impression

32
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,884
Major Kira has been
nothing but trouble...

33
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:33,260
Who gave you that impression?

34
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,555
Common knowledge.

35
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:38,849
Major Kira has my
complete respect.

36
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,308
She's been invaluable

37
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,310
in establishing
this command post,

38
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,397
and now she's been dismissed
without anyone consulting me,

39
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:46,982
and I don't appreciate it.

40
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:50,694
Commander, Starfleet
doesn't consult us

41
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:52,696
when they wish to promote
one of their officers.

42
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,823
Are you suggesting that this
is a promotion for Kira?

43
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,742
Certainly, it is.

44
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:58,869
We need to find
the proper spot for her.

45
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,830
After all, she's the one
who brought Li Nalas back to us.

46
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,834
Well, then, that's
a different matter.

47
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,548
I'm glad you see it.

48
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,717
Yes, of course I do.

49
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,427
For a minute,
I was thinking to myself

50
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:18,179
"There's a warm wind
blowing in from Minicoy."

51
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,228
I'm sorry?

52
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,439
It's just
an old saying from Earth.

53
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,609
It all started with a famous
ambassador from Minicoy

54
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:33,487
who used to bluster,
exaggerate, and dissemble

55
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,114
to get what he wanted.

56
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:37,032
Not at all like you or me.

57
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:39,326
He was a bag
of hot air,

58
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:42,245
and everyone recognized him
for what he was.

59
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:46,750
May I assume you're satisfied
with the assignment of Li

60
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,794
to fill your vacant post?

61
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:50,587
I'd thought you'd want Li
to stay in the capital

62
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,255
to strengthen
the provisional government.

63
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:55,467
Frankly, I'm not sure
it's safe in the capital

64
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:57,302
with what's going on these days.

65
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,804
The Circle?

66
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:01,306
The fires and graffiti
were a nuisance,

67
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,808
but two days ago

68
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:06,227
one of my fellow Ministers
was attacked and beaten.

69
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:09,690
We can't risk the same thing
happening to Li Nalas.

70
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,530
Look at it this way, Commander.

71
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,659
We're entrusting
Bajor's greatest hero to you.

72
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:21,952
Could you have

73
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,871
a better liaison
officer than Li Nalas?

74
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,706
I think not.

75
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,627
Commander, your son
has been waiting

76
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,837
to speak to you
on the com.

77
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,382
Jake?

78
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,925
<i>Dad?</i>
<i>I'm outside our quarters.</i>

79
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,886
<i>Could you come down</i>
<i>for a minute?</i>

80
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,470
Is something wrong?

81
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,723
<i>I really think you ought</i>
<i>to come down, Dad.</i>

82
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,558
On my way.

83
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:50,313
What's the problem?

84
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,815
Look.

85
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,401
(<i> door chimes</i> )

86
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:01,778
Come in.

87
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,783
You're not...?

88
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,076
Leaving?

89
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,452
I really don't have
much choice, do I?

90
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,871
You're not just
leaving, Major.

91
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:11,997
You're surrendering.

92
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,540
You break the rules, you pay.

93
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,875
Wait a minute.

94
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,668
I want to be sure
I heard that correctly

95
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,712
because it doesn't sound
like the Kira Nerys

96
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,881
who has made a career
out of breaking the rules.

97
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,590
Well, I guess I broke
one too many.

98
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,218
Major, you've been
breaking one too many

99
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:25,802
for 14 1/2 years.

100
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,223
Cardassian rules, Bajoran
rules, Federation rules--

101
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:31,266
they're all meaningless to you

102
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,434
because you have a personal code

103
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,436
that's always
mattered more

104
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:38,899
and I'm sorry to say,
you're in slim company.

105
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,775
I'll miss you too, Odo.

106
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:47,115
Have you asked
Sisko for help?

107
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:50,035
I'm sure he'll do whatever he
thinks is best for the station.

108
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,953
You haven't even
gone to him?

109
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,955
Well, what do you
want me to do, Odo?

110
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,498
Fight for what you want!
It's what you do best!

111
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,292
Well, maybe I just want
a vacation.

112
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,878
Ach! Idiotic bureaucracy!

113
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:03,131
Now, I suppose they'll expect
me to break in a new man.

114
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,842
A great man-- Li Nalas
can handle the job, believe me.

115
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,844
Well, you did
fairly well at it

116
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,263
once I smoothed
your rough edges.

117
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:11,098
Hah.

118
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,640
What's so funny?

119
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,269
I thought<i> you</i>
did fairly well

120
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,520
once I smoothed
<i>your</i> rough edges.

121
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,022
(<i> door chiming</i> )

122
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,232
Yes?

123
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:21,275
Am I disturbing anything?

124
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:22,525
Stick around.

125
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,027
You can help me cry
in my synthale.

126
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,486
I thought I should return
this epidellic lotion.

127
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:26,988
No. If you like it...

128
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,907
Oh, it's wonderful.
Well, then keep it.

129
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,325
How can you be chatting
about skin lotion

130
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:31,910
at a time like this?
(<i> door chimes</i> )

131
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,745
Do you have any idea
where you'll be stationed?

132
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,163
Come in.
Not yet.

133
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,831
They say that after I've
taken some leave time

134
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,166
I've earned a desk

135
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,043
at the Foreign Affairs
Building somewhere.

136
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,169
Doctor.

137
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,212
Foreign Affairs
Building?

138
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:43,255
I came to give you my best.

139
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:44,256
Well, that's
rather dull.

140
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:45,299
I beg your pardon?

141
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:46,300
Dull is a polite word for it.

142
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,968
Doctor, if you were Kira

143
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,178
wouldn't you at least be
complaining to Commander Sisko?

144
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,180
Look, I just wanted
to wish you good luck.

145
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,514
Thank you, Doctor.

146
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:54,474
Complaining about what?

147
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,976
Never mind, Doctor.

148
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,019
If she doesn't care,
why should we?

149
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,562
Have they given you
any reason yet?

150
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,064
Did they give you
any alternative?

151
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,232
I do care.
No, they haven't.

152
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:03,442
No, they didn't.

153
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:04,734
I really ought
to finish packing.

154
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,902
You said she doesn't care.

155
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,195
You mean about
leaving the station?

156
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,155
(<i> door chimes</i> )

157
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,656
By all means,
come on in.

158
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,032
She's done well here.
She ought to stay here.

159
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,575
And I say she could use
a little support

160
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:13,660
from her friends, Doctor.

161
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,869
Well, yes,
certainly, but...

162
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,330
Uh...

163
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,665
Chief! Come in.

164
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:19,916
I didn't mean to intrude.

165
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,251
I was just...

166
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,836
Don't worry, Chief,
it's all been said.

167
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,464
I have a good deal more to say,
thank you, Doctor.

168
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:26,465
Look, I could come back.

169
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:27,799
DAX:
Odo, leave her alone.

170
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,426
This is Kira's
decision to make--

171
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,470
unless, of course, you
want me to talk to Sisko.

172
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,513
I knew what I was doing.
I knew the risk.

173
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,265
That's not
what she asked.

174
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,850
I'd just like to say, Major

175
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,810
it's been a pleasure
serving with you.

176
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,395
(<i> door chimes</i> )
Come in.

177
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,063
Will someone please explain
this conversation to me?

178
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,898
A party! Oh!

179
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,942
For you, I would have reduced
my catering rate.

180
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:46,901
It's not a party.

181
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,320
Voodai.
What's that?

182
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,364
A bottle of my favorite
synthale, I think.

183
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:51,490
That's very
thoughtful, Quark.

184
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,033
It's also very small.

185
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,702
I was anticipating
a far smaller gathering.

186
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,121
I thought perhaps
an intimate farewell drink

187
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,373
a sympathetic smile...

188
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,915
a shoulder to cry on.

189
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:01,875
As I was
saying, Major...

190
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,084
You'd be surprised

191
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,169
how often
that works with women.

192
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,170
Is this a joke?

193
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,629
Did you plan this?

194
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:07,839
BASHIR:
Nobody could have<i> planned</i> this.

195
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,882
(<i> door chimes</i> )

196
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:09,924
Oh, we're open
for business.

197
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:10,967
Come on in,
join the crowd.

198
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,053
Vedek Bareil.

199
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,763
I hope I'm not interrupting.

200
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,015
No. Please come in.

201
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,100
These are my...

202
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:24,439
these are my friends.

203
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:31,530
I had no idea you were coming
to the space station.

204
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,614
Well, nowadays,
it's probably wiser

205
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,575
not to announce these things.

206
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,369
How bad is it
on Bajor, Vedek?

207
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:39,246
The violence has

208
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:40,914
seriously escalated.

209
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,624
It almost seems there are
more weapons on the street now

210
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:44,959
than during the occupation.

211
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,294
How could that be?

212
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,962
Where would they be coming from?

213
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:51,550
I try to concentrate
on more spiritual matters.

214
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,967
Yes, of course.

215
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,678
I mean... I didn't mean
to suggest that you...

216
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,721
I understand

217
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,557
your duties here
are finished.

218
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:01,393
Yes, they are.

219
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:04,271
Do you have any immediate plans?

220
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:12,695
I haven't really had much chance
to give it any thought.

221
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:16,366
Then perhaps I have
the perfect solution.

222
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:20,161
Come and stay at our
monastery for a while.

223
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:24,707
It can help when the spirit
gets a little bruised.

224
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,710
Thank you.

225
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:11,963
Major?

226
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:18,094
I just want you
to know that, uh...

227
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:22,849
if there's anything
I can do to help.

228
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,809
Major...

229
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,520
I'm sorry.

230
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,855
I didn't want this job.

231
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,275
Neither did I.

232
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,694
I mean, back when
I was sent here

233
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:37,155
in the first place

234
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:40,908
but it, um, turned out
better than I expected.

235
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:43,870
I'm sure it will
for you as well.

236
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:47,748
I don't even know
what I'm supposed to do here.

237
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:50,585
How does a "Navarch"

238
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:53,921
fit into
this command structure?

239
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,966
SISKO:
As I understand
the position

240
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,386
you report directly
to the Prophets

241
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:02,222
but, from time to time,
I might ask your help.

242
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,722
Commander

243
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:10,063
anything you need from me,
I will try my best to do

244
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:15,360
but I know that I can
never replace Major Kira.

245
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,278
No one could.

246
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,366
Thank you, sir.

247
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:26,913
Request permission to disembark.

248
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,418
I'm going
to get you back, Major.

249
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:37,006
I promise that
to both of us.

250
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,561
Docking Bay 3.

251
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:25,430
May I make a
friendly observation?

252
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,307
It's crooked.

253
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,975
It's crooked.

254
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,227
I've been adjusting it
for an hour.

255
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,395
It looks fine from over here,

256
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:35,440
but then I go
over there and it's...

257
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,857
(<i> sighs</i> )

258
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,319
This isn't working, Bareil.

259
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,362
It's only a row
of stones.

260
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,156
No, it isn't.
It's me.

261
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,574
The stones are straight.

262
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:46,743
I'm the one who's crooked.

263
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:49,954
Is that really
how you see yourself?

264
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,748
Sometimes.

265
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:54,542
Sometimes I even like
being that way.

266
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:06,053
If I stay here much longer

267
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:09,390
I'm sure I could destroy
your entire arboretum.

268
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,393
Well, perhaps you'd
rather try your hand

269
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,270
at woodcrafts.

270
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:18,232
Can I tell you something
very personal?

271
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,651
Of course.

272
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,235
You won't tell?

273
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,363
I'm a Vedek.

274
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:28,242
I have absolutely
no artistic skills.

275
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:31,287
I was the worst finger painter
at the four-year-old level.

276
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,664
My parents were humiliated.

277
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:35,041
It'll be our secret.

278
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,752
The point is...

279
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:40,296
I'm useless here.

280
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,215
So?

281
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,425
So?

282
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,594
I need to feel useful.

283
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,596
It might be interesting

284
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,640
to explore useless
for a while--

285
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,684
see how it feels.

286
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,811
Oh...

287
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,814
Well, you don't know me.

288
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,107
I'm beginning to.

289
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:05,363
It's time, isn't it?

290
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:08,533
Time?

291
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,702
Come inside with me.

292
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:12,412
I really should finish...

293
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,455
Come.

294
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,729
I've never been to this part
of the monastery before.

295
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:41,190
May it be the first
of many visits.

296
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,193
Bareil, maybe we
should talk about...

297
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,332
Oh, Bareil...

298
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:01,544
all my life, I dreamed of this.

299
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,813
It is the Third Orb--

300
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:22,899
the Orb of Prophecy
and Change.

301
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,741
What do I do?

302
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:35,453
Be useless, Nerys.

303
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:39,373
Allow the Prophets
to guide you.

304
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,927
The Chamber of Ministers.

305
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,763
Dax.

306
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:54,973
Listen to them, Kira.

307
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:56,724
I can't hear them.

308
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:57,976
It's all right.

309
00:16:57,976 --> 00:16:59,519
Listen.

310
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:06,567
(<i> gasps</i> )

311
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,945
Can you hear them now, child?

312
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,990
JARO:
I hear them, Major.

313
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,617
They're calling to me.

314
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,911
BAREIL:
Don't listen to him, Nerys.

315
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:20,623
Allow<i> yourself</i> to hear them.

316
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:23,209
They're calling to you.

317
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,295
Blasphemy.

318
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,882
(<i> gasps</i> )

319
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,049
Listen to them, Nerys.

320
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,926
Help me to hear them.

321
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:33,678
I don't know how.

322
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:36,014
But you do.

323
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,440
You do.

324
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,834
You do.

325
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,843
(<i> gasping</i> )

326
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,061
<i>Last night alone,</i>
<i>we had dozens of beatings.</i>

327
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:24,270
<i>They're everywhere--</i>

328
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,354
<i>till we go looking for them</i>

329
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,856
<i>and then they're nowhere.</i>

330
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,691
Which would suggest
they have powerful friends

331
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:30,443
to warn them and protect them.

332
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:31,986
<i>Probably.</i>

333
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,446
<i>We've got to put a stop to this</i>

334
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,655
<i>before it gets out of hand.</i>

335
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,323
<i>Now, the provisional government</i>

336
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,076
<i>is bringing troops</i>
<i>into the capital.</i>

337
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:39,410
Troops?

338
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,203
<i>That will put an end</i>
<i>to the Circle.</i>

339
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,957
<i>And you keep your eyes open</i>
<i>up there, old friend.</i>

340
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,834
I always do.

341
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,755
No, I haven't
made any progress

342
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,966
in finding the ones
who assaulted you.

343
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:54,467
It's over, Odo.

344
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,635
The investigation
isn't closed.

345
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:56,719
It's just...

346
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,512
You don't understand.

347
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,555
It's over.

348
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:00,848
What are you talking about?

349
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,016
Everything.

350
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:04,477
Bajor, the provisional
government

351
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,479
the Federation being
here-- all of it.

352
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,939
We got to leave.

353
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:09,523
Well, I do anyway.

354
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,651
You can just turn
into a couch.

355
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,070
You mean because
of this Circle business?

356
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,363
They're just
a bunch of hooligans

357
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,532
who use violence
to get attention.

358
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:21,327
I happen to know they
have enough weapons

359
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:24,163
and explosives and supplies
to support an army.

360
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,582
How do you know that?

361
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,584
I've been asking questions
of people

362
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,920
who don't answer questions
from people like you.

363
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,422
Where would the Circle
be getting so many weapons?

364
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,465
The Kressari.

365
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:35,675
The Kressari?

366
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,384
That doesn't make any sense.

367
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,720
The Kressari
don't even have a military.

368
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,305
They're botanic DNA traders.

369
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:44,517
Well, they're not
delivering flowers these days.

370
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,268
I know, Odo.

371
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,773
Computer, when's the next
Kressari vessel due here?

372
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:53,151
The Kressari Vessel<i> Calondon</i>

373
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:56,988
is scheduled to arrive
in 36 hours.

374
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,574
Do you know
where these weapons

375
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,451
are being sent to on Bajor?

376
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,452
No, not exactly.

377
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,704
Find out.

378
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,622
Are you out of your mind?

379
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:10,084
My plan is to put
as much distance as possible

380
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:12,378
between me and Bajor,
thank you very much.

381
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,005
(<i> sighs</i> )

382
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:16,507
Quark, I hate to do this,
but I guess I'll have to.

383
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:17,550
That's not fair.

384
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,135
I haven't done anything yet.

385
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,344
Whatever you're going to do,
it's not fair.

386
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,345
You're a deputy.

387
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,347
It's not-- what?

388
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,348
You're a deputy.

389
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,641
I want you to find out

390
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,185
where the weapons
are going on Bajor.

391
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:29,812
Meanwhile...

392
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,064
I'm going to find out

393
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:33,024
exactly where
they're coming from.

394
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:35,275
You and me, a team?

395
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,903
That's right.

396
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,529
(<i> laughing loudly</i> )

397
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,160
Good-bye.

398
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,913
Either that or I'm
putting you in a cell.

399
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,247
That's not fair.

400
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,582
On what charge?

401
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,751
Impeding an investigation--

402
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,878
unless you want
to reveal the identities

403
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:55,213
of the people
you've been talking to.

404
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:56,338
You know
I can't do that.

405
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,092
It's your choice.

406
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:01,802
You're a deputy
or you're a prisoner.

407
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:07,433
I'm a deputy.

408
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,355
I've got to go to Bajor.

409
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,941
Odo has some information

410
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,192
that suggests
we may be facing a coup,

411
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,610
and I've got to check
things out.

412
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,819
Is there any way
I can help?

413
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,279
Your military contacts--

414
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,655
see if you can
get a feeling

415
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:22,782
for how much support

416
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,658
the provisional
government has.

417
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,660
No problem.
What about the station
while you're gone?

418
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,455
Dax and Mr. O'Brien
can handle things in Ops.

419
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:30,957
If you need
any other help...

420
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:32,374
Help?
I can't even sneeze

421
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,585
without three people
handing me handkerchiefs

422
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:36,003
but I<i> was</i> thinking

423
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,172
we might want
to establish a curfew.

424
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:40,258
Another cargo bay was
vandalized last night.

425
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:41,217
Good idea.

426
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,342
I've asked Odo

427
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,803
to assign you
a bodyguard.

428
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,054
Oh, it's not necessary.

429
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:46,264
I think it is.

430
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:47,556
Docking Bay 1.

431
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:57,483
Woodcrafts--

432
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,277
definitely the
way to go.

433
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:01,320
Is that where
the Prophets led you?

434
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,991
Yeah. Lots of, uh, hammers
and nails and saws

435
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,366
surrounded by monks
and Vedeks--

436
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:07,743
very safe and secure.

437
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,954
You don't want
to talk about it.

438
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:12,165
No.

439
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:21,966
Can I tell you something
very personal?

440
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:24,802
I'm not a Vedek,
but I can keep a secret.

441
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:28,139
The last time
I encountered
the Third Orb

442
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:30,474
you were part
of my vision.

443
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,434
Me?

444
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:35,562
It's the reason
I came to the station

445
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:37,815
to invite you here.

446
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:39,317
What...

447
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:43,070
what part did I play
in your vision?

448
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,323
It's not important.

449
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:48,868
I was just wondering
if I was part of yours.

450
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,370
No. No, you weren't.

451
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,081
(<i> rumbling</i> )

452
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:57,375
How could there be a storm
on a day as lovely as this?

453
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:58,544
That's not thunder.

454
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,378
I know that sound.
That's gunfire.

455
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:04,591
What a pleasure to come upon
such a flowing exchange

456
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:07,636
of spiritual
harmony.

457
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,305
Vedek Winn.

458
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:12,558
We've met before,
haven't we... Major?

459
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:13,934
Major...

460
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,561
Kira Nerys.

461
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,730
That's right.

462
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,565
Major Kira.

463
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,734
From the space station.

464
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,110
What brings you here?

465
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,403
I do, Vedek Winn.

466
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:27,781
Good for you,
Vedek Bareil.

467
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:31,577
After working so hard,
you deserve a little recreation.

468
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,207
Major Kira is here
to explore her<i> pagh.</i>

469
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:38,542
A worthy endeavor
for someone who has led

470
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:41,003
such a life of violence, child.

471
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:43,923
And I'm sure the Assembly
would have had no objection

472
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:44,965
to your encounter

473
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,592
with an Orb

474
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,677
had Vedek Bareil consulted us.

475
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,931
No one has ever been held
to that formality.

476
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,682
You're right,
of course.

477
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:57,978
But I've always consulted
with the Assembly in advance.

478
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,022
I think of it as a courtesy.

479
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:02,733
Nothing more, nothing less.

480
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:05,194
How long will you be
with us, Major?

481
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:07,405
I'm not sure.

482
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:12,492
Feel free to stay as many days
as you like.

483
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:14,036
Even a week, if necessary.

484
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,718
Have them withdraw from
the northeast quadrant.

485
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,095
Move them to join

486
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:33,222
the 14th column
<i>south</i> of the city.

487
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,900
General Krim.

488
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,611
I'm Benjamin Sisko.

489
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,363
We met during a session

490
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:50,906
of the Executive
Committee last year.

491
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,659
I remember, Commander.

492
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:56,578
I was impressed
by your talk.

493
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,956
As I recall, you disagreed
with all of it.

494
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:00,498
Yes.

495
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:02,876
But you presented
your arguments well.

496
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,711
What can I do for you?

497
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:06,630
I understand
you're in command

498
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,632
of the forces
defending the city.

499
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:11,302
I'd hardly call it
defending the city.

500
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:12,886
There is concern
in some quarters

501
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,763
that the military is unwilling

502
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:17,057
to confront the forces
of the Circle.

503
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,852
I don't know with whom
you've been speaking, Commander.

504
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,687
I've been observing
troop movements.

505
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:24,773
Every time there is
a potential confrontation

506
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:27,109
the military withdraws
to a safer position.

507
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:29,778
You can't possibly appreciate

508
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,781
that this is Bajoran
against Bajoran.

509
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,617
I appreciate that the
provisional government

510
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:38,371
will stand<i> only</i> if the
military supports it.

511
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:43,000
We are all patriots, Commander.

512
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,960
We have intelligence
that the Circle

513
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,753
is being armed
by the Kressari.

514
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,088
The Kressari?

515
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:54,761
I hadn't heard that.

516
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,305
We've been trying
to track the movement

517
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:57,306
of those shipments.

518
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:58,682
If we could determine

519
00:25:58,682 --> 00:25:59,892
where they're stored,
then we can...

520
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,727
I'd like to know.

521
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:03,770
You'll be the first one
I contact.

522
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,939
Thank you.

523
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,775
There is one other thing,
General.

524
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:12,488
My First Officer,
Major Kira Nerys...

525
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:14,198
Yes, I know Major Kira.

526
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:15,657
I understand

527
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,910
she hasn't been reassigned yet.

528
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:21,080
It would mean a great deal to me
to get her back.

529
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,249
That's out of my purview,
Commander.

530
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:26,710
You might want to discuss it
with Minister Jaro.

531
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:33,008
Commander Sisko...

532
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,678
you told me about
the Kressari

533
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,972
before you asked the
favor regarding Kira.

534
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:46,688
You could have tried
to trade that information

535
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:47,940
for the favor.

536
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,484
I wouldn't do that.

537
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:53,904
I'll remember that about you.

538
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:01,995
He's calling again.

539
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:08,252
What do you think
we should do?

540
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:13,466
I think he's getting
tired of seeing me smile.

541
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:16,009
Anything new
from O'Brien or Odo?

542
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,304
They haven't come up
with anything yet.

543
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,892
(<i> sighs</i> )

544
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,685
All right.

545
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,563
Put him on the screen.

546
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:30,608
I will give this a try.

547
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:33,068
I am First Officer
Li Nalas.

548
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,779
Can I help you?

549
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:38,574
Somebody better be able
to help me.

550
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:41,076
I have been delayed
for six hours.

551
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:44,704
I can assure you
the Kressari government

552
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:46,457
will lodge a formal protest.

553
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:47,791
My apologies.

554
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,336
Apparently, there has been
some confusion

555
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:52,004
with your manifest interface

556
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:54,798
in our computer inventory
system that had to be...

557
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,800
Yes, yes.
I know all of that.

558
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,803
I didn't know they were going
to be opening

559
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,680
every container
in my cargo hold!

560
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,809
Do you understand
these are highly sensitive

561
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,769
herbaceous materials?

562
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:11,106
I am sure that all necessary
precautions are being taken.

563
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:14,401
This is ridiculous.
I have a schedule to keep!

564
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,903
We should be able to have this
all cleared up in a few minutes.

565
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:20,115
That's what I was told
a few hours ago.

566
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:29,958
Dax to O'Brien.

567
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,835
Yes, Lieutenant?

568
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:34,046
We don't want to hold up
the Kressari

569
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:35,839
any longer than necessary.

570
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,925
Well, there isn't much more
we can accomplish for now.

571
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,345
The ship's due back here
the day after tomorrow.

572
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:44,139
Perhaps we'll be able to correct
any additional problems then.

573
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,392
Yeah, we'd come
to the same conclusion.

574
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:47,934
O'Brien out.

575
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:51,730
A fair voyage to you, Captain.

576
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,943
Prepare for immediate departure.

577
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,578
(<i> squeaking</i> )

578
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,335
Major.

579
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:18,048
Commander.
I didn't hear you.

580
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:23,512
I'm sorry if
I interrupted

581
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:25,305
your meditation.

582
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:26,806
Daydream.

583
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:27,891
Daydreaming...

584
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:30,519
I think I remember
doing that

585
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:33,272
a long, long time ago.

586
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:36,024
I've discovered
it's like riding a bicycle.

587
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,859
It comes back to you
right away.

588
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:38,985
Can I bring you

589
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:40,529
back to reality
for a minute?

590
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:43,156
Back to reality...

591
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,825
or back to DS9?

592
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,494
Are you still interested?

593
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:50,372
A lot has happened here.

594
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:55,794
I encountered an Orb,
Commander.

595
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:59,632
It's given me
a great deal to think about.

596
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:02,468
They do have a way of
doing that, don't they?

597
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:05,679
Well...

598
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,264
I just came
to let you know

599
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:08,848
that we haven't
given up yet

600
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:10,016
but for the moment

601
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,685
there seem to be
some bigger problems

602
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:12,894
for the leaders down here.

603
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:15,855
I heard the gunfire
in the distance.

604
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:19,443
That distance
is getting closer.

605
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:21,861
The Circle is
for real, Major.

606
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:24,197
They've been armed
for a coup.

607
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,199
And I'm not at all convinced
that the military

608
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,661
is going to back the
provisional government.

609
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:31,705
I didn't realize it...

610
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:37,002
We've been so isolated.

611
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:40,964
Well..

612
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,467
I guess I'd better get back.

613
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:44,968
Commander...

614
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:49,097
Me, too.

615
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,602
I told you I haven't given up.

616
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:09,075
(<i> Kira gasps</i> )

617
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:10,369
(<i> hypospray hisses</i> )

618
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:24,966
(<i> squeaking</i> )

619
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,510
KRESSARI:
Begin transport.

620
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:36,061
I think you'll find
everything's in order.

621
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:42,025
(<i> instrument buzzing</i> )

622
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,527
Very well.

623
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:45,738
If you'll sign off
on the shipment

624
00:31:45,738 --> 00:31:46,864
we'll be on our way.

625
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:52,327
CARDASSIAN:
Return transport.

626
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,663
(<i> whoosh of active transport)</i>

627
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,920
(<i> squeaking</i> )

628
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,964
(<i> indistinct voices</i> )

629
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,930
Good afternoon.

630
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,904
So... you're involved

631
00:32:26,904 --> 00:32:28,697
with the Circle.

632
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:29,907
I am the Circle, Major.

633
00:32:29,907 --> 00:32:31,867
Now I understand
why you wanted

634
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:34,578
to ship Li Nalas
off to the station.

635
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:35,788
The last thing
I need right now

636
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:37,205
is a great war hero

637
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,875
capturing the devotion
of the Bajoran people.

638
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:42,294
How can you betray
your own government?

639
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:43,378
Major, I don't have

640
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,797
to tell you.

641
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:47,257
I've heard your opinion
of this government.

642
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:48,634
Government?

643
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:50,677
They can't even agree
it is a government

644
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,137
so they call it "provisional."

645
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:54,473
It's just another word
for powerless.

646
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:03,941
I won't allow the Bajoran people
to be powerless anymore.

647
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:06,693
We have been doormats

648
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:09,613
to the Cardassians,
and now the Federation--

649
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:11,824
any great power that happens by.

650
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:14,075
We will not be that again.

651
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:18,831
We are a people who brought art
and architecture

652
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:19,998
to countless planets.

653
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,875
We don't deserve to be victims.

654
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:24,837
If you want to change
the government, Minister Jaro

655
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:26,546
you vote to change it.

656
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:29,549
You don't sneak up
from behind it with a dagger.

657
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,343
We'll discuss politics
at another time.

658
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:34,805
I need to know, please,
what the Federation will do

659
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:36,974
once our objective
becomes clear.

660
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:45,524
Major, I've heard you have
no love for the Federation.

661
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:47,275
I'm not an unreasonable man.

662
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,610
I'm willing to send you back
to the station

663
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,320
if that's what you want.

664
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,198
I'll give you that station
after we get rid of Starfleet.

665
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:54,825
Now, do you believe
they will continue

666
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:56,451
to support the
provisional government?

667
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,453
How about
our own military?

668
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,247
I'd worry about them first
if I were you.

669
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,043
What will the Federation do,
Major?

670
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,336
What will Sisko do?

671
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:08,672
You know him better
than any Bajoran.

672
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:19,057
No one despises the Cardassians
more than I, Major

673
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,977
but we did learn
a few things from them.

674
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:24,938
Like how to encourage people
to talk.

675
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:27,106
Let's go.

676
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,869
Bareil says there were
no signs of a struggle.

677
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:41,162
Maybe somebody
saw them leave.

678
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:44,041
That's what we need to find out.

679
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:46,084
O'BRIEN:
What if they transported
her off the grounds?

680
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,878
Let's hope they didn't.

681
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:49,796
Now, we can't expect much help
from the local authorities.

682
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,381
They've got their hands full.

683
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:54,801
Commander, I should be able
to get some cooperation.

684
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:55,886
If my name carries any weight

685
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:56,929
let's use it.

686
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:57,888
Good.

687
00:34:57,888 --> 00:34:58,931
When's Odo due back?

688
00:34:58,931 --> 00:35:00,849
Not for another 12 hours.

689
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:04,394
Who needs Odo when you've got
his number one deputy?

690
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:06,521
Quark, this
isn't the time.

691
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,481
No, this is exactly the time.

692
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,067
I think I know
where you can find Kira.

693
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:11,568
Go on.

694
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:14,738
You see, uh, Odo blackmailed me
into helping him.

695
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:16,322
A matter which I've been meaning

696
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,741
to bring to your
attention, Commander.

697
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:18,867
Quark.

698
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,452
I managed to find out

699
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:23,162
where the Circle's
headquarters is.

700
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,707
In the labyrinths beneath
the Perikian peninsula.

701
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:27,417
Sisko to security.

702
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:28,627
Go ahead.

703
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,295
I need a couple of officers

704
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:32,464
to go on a rescue mission
to Bajor.

705
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:33,715
Report to Runabout Pad C.

706
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:34,967
On our way.

707
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:37,260
Doctor, Lieutenant,
you're with me.

708
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,261
Mr. O'Brien

709
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,179
you'll be our pilot.

710
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,431
Configure the runabout sensors

711
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:42,975
for a full sweep
of the peninsula.

712
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:45,226
Once we find the base,
I'll depending a great deal

713
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,686
on your famous
transporter talents.

714
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:47,646
Aye, sir.

715
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:49,982
Commander,
I'm going.

716
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:51,775
No, it's too dangerous.

717
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:54,402
Don't you understand?
I can do this.

718
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,529
I don't know what it means
to be a Navarch

719
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:59,282
but I can fight in the trenches
and I take orders well.

720
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:02,828
Besides, I owe her one.

721
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,332
Dax, you're in charge.

722
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:10,002
We can discuss appropriate
compensation for this

723
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:11,711
at a more convenient time!

724
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:21,096
Need one.

725
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,725
Check all the settings
on those phasers.

726
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:29,187
Two men, Sector B.

727
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,188
Take your positions.

728
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,439
Yes, sir.

729
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,121
(<i> indistinct voices</i> )

730
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:47,789
Only five

731
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:49,582
but they've got
more firearms

732
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,417
than a Galaxy-class
starship.

733
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,586
(<i> Kira yelling</i> )

734
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:56,131
Where the hell's
it coming from?

735
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:00,093
All right,
straight power play.

736
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:01,803
Nothing fancy.

737
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:04,389
Expect heavy resistance.

738
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,265
Anyone who finds Kira

739
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:08,434
pin this on her,
and call for transport

740
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:09,644
immediately.

741
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:12,981
Let's do it.

742
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:19,529
(<i> yelling</i> )

743
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:24,492
Kira!

744
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:48,725
Chief

745
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:50,852
get us out of here!

746
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:05,075
We don't have time for this.

747
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,121
Ow, ow.
Ouch.

748
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:10,413
Do not talk.

749
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,165
We have to assume
Jaro will move quickly

750
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:13,416
now that we've got you back.

751
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,834
Li is the only
chance we've got.

752
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,544
Me?

753
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:19,589
Jaro knows you're the only
force that could stop him.

754
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:20,882
If we could get him
to the Chamber

755
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:21,967
of Ministers...

756
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:23,426
It's much
too great a risk.

757
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,220
He'd be dead before he
had a chance to speak.

758
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,388
Courtesy of a Cardassian weapon.

759
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,224
The Circle's being supplied

760
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:30,349
by the Cardassians.

761
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:31,309
What?

762
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,352
I borrowed the proof.

763
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:36,064
It's got a Gul's
thumb scan on it.

764
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:38,233
The Circle hates
the Cardassians.

765
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:39,901
They don't know
it<i> is</i> the Cardassians.

766
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:42,528
They think they've been buying
from Kressari traders.

767
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:43,613
I don't understand.

768
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:45,448
Why would
the Cardassians

769
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,533
want to help Jaro
if he hates them?

770
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:50,245
Because it gets them
what they want the most.

771
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:51,329
Rid of us.

772
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,123
They're just using Jaro.

773
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:55,792
Once the Federation
is forced to leave...

774
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:57,627
The Cardassians
come back.

775
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:59,296
We've got to do
something.

776
00:38:59,296 --> 00:39:01,380
<i>I've</i> got to
do something.

777
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:05,718
Sisko to Ops.

778
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,095
DAX:
<i>Go ahead.</i>

779
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:09,264
Dax, open a channel to Bajor.

780
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:11,432
<i>Tell them that Navarch Li Nalas</i>

781
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:14,519
<i>wants to address the Chamber</i>
<i>of Ministers on subspace.</i>

782
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:15,979
I can't do it, Benjamin.

783
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:18,356
All frequencies
to Bajor are jammed.

784
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:21,776
<i>We lost all communication with</i>
<i>the planet five minutes ago.</i>

785
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,278
Then, it has started.

786
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:29,617
Get me Admiral Chekote
at Starfleet Command.

787
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:42,630
I feel the Prophets
smiling on me today, Vedek.

788
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:46,425
The Prophets have rarely
encountered a<i> pagh</i>

789
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:49,888
as forceful as yours,
Minister Jaro.

790
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:56,644
So, what's it
to be, Winn?

791
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,855
Be?

792
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:02,275
Don't tease me.

793
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:06,363
I can't interpret
the prophecies for you, Essa.

794
00:40:06,363 --> 00:40:08,865
I know the future.

795
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:11,034
It belongs to me.

796
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:13,870
I don't need your
interpretation.

797
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,872
Then what?

798
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:19,334
Your support.

799
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:21,920
I've made it very clear
to you how I feel.

800
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,423
Your public support.

801
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:29,928
Support from the Vedek
of an order so small as mine

802
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:33,806
surely would not be significant.

803
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:40,605
You stand for a return...
to orthodox values, as do I.

804
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:43,400
We're a match
made by the Prophets.

805
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,736
I wish there were more
with that opinion.

806
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:49,488
Unfortunately,
as my assembly

807
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:52,533
approaches the selection
of a new Kai

808
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:55,870
I fear my voice
is rarely heard.

809
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,330
That can change.

810
00:40:57,330 --> 00:41:00,708
Can it?

811
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,795
Think of the prestige of having
the new leader of Bajor

812
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:05,671
being a member of your order.

813
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,218
If you<i> are</i>
the new leader.

814
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:14,931
Have the Prophets given you
a reason to doubt it?

815
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:17,600
I didn't say that.

816
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:25,524
Then let them bless
my ascension.

817
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:28,486
Tell the people
the Prophets are with me.

818
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:33,199
That's a lot to ask.

819
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,327
I know that.

820
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:40,832
I need more than
just prestige, Essa.

821
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,459
I know that, too.

822
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:44,461
The people
need leadership

823
00:41:44,461 --> 00:41:46,171
to return to
the old values--

824
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:49,007
yours and mine.

825
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,595
I can think of no
one more worthy

826
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,514
of being the next
Kai than you, Winn.

827
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,017
I shall do everything
in my power

828
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:00,518
to see that you are.

829
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:07,859
The Prophets<i> are</i> smiling
on you today, Minister.

830
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:21,789
Dax?

831
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,916
I have Admiral Chekote
on subspace.

832
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,668
In my office.

833
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,128
Commander, two
assault vessels

834
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:28,254
are headed this way

835
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,714
on direct course
from Bajor.

836
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:31,216
They've given
all non-Bajorans

837
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:32,509
seven hours
to evacuate.

838
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,765
Admiral, are you up-to-date
on my communiqués?

839
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:43,186
<i>I think so, Commander.</i>
<i>How's it look?</i>

840
00:42:43,186 --> 00:42:45,522
Not good--
Jaro has the military,

841
00:42:45,522 --> 00:42:47,357
communications have been
cut off,

842
00:42:47,357 --> 00:42:49,192
and assault vessels
are on their way here.

843
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:50,485
<i>Are you preparing to withdraw?</i>

844
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:52,945
Admiral, we've just
obtained evidence

845
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:54,447
that the Circle's
been receiving weapons

846
00:42:54,447 --> 00:42:55,740
from the Cardassians.

847
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,326
If we withdraw,
we'll be giving Bajor

848
00:42:58,326 --> 00:42:59,911
and the wormhole back to them.

849
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:01,579
<i>Damn.</i>

850
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:04,499
<i>That's a hell of a turn.</i>

851
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:07,043
<i>How can these Bajorans get</i>
<i>in bed with the Cardassians?</i>

852
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:09,462
They don't even know
the Cardassians are involved.

853
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:11,297
<i>Then you're saying</i>
<i>that it's</i>

854
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:13,508
<i>a genuine political revolution</i>
<i>internal to Bajor.</i>

855
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:15,427
Supported by the Cardassians.

856
00:43:15,427 --> 00:43:18,179
<i>But internal to Bajor.</i>

857
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:20,932
<i>The Cardassians</i>
<i>might involve themselves</i>

858
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:24,352
<i>in other people's civil wars,</i>
<i>but we don't.</i>

859
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:26,396
<i>The Prime Directive applies,</i>
<i>Ben.</i>

860
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:30,525
Admiral.

861
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:33,445
<i>Would you say that our people</i>
<i>on the station are in danger?</i>

862
00:43:33,445 --> 00:43:35,071
Yes.

863
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:37,282
<i>Then there's no other choice</i>
<i>but to evacuate.</i>

864
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:38,866
<i>We'll have to worry</i>

865
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,119
<i>about the long-term</i>
<i>political implications</i>

866
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,412
<i>down the road.</i>

867
00:43:42,412 --> 00:43:43,913
<i>That's an order, Commander.</i>

868
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,506
Chief, how long will it take us
to evacuate Deep Space 9?

869
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:55,716
I'd say we could have
all of our people

870
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:57,594
out and away
in... three hours.

871
00:43:57,594 --> 00:43:59,637
I mean
a complete evacuation.

872
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:03,433
I intend to take all Starfleet
instruments, materiel...

873
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:06,436
in fact, all Federation
property of any kind.

874
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:07,895
How quickly
can we do that?

875
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:10,231
Well, sir, that'll
take days--

876
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:11,774
one week,
for all I know--

877
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:13,568
but those assault vessels

878
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:15,820
are going to be here
in seven hours.

879
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:23,828
Then, I guess some of us
won't quite be done

880
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:25,497
by the time they get here.
