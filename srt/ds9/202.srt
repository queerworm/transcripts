00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:05,327
Last time on <i>Deep Space Nine...</i>

2
00:00:05,368 --> 00:00:06,495
This is the emblem

3
00:00:06,536 --> 00:00:08,061
of the Alliance
for Global Unity.

4
00:00:08,106 --> 00:00:09,870
They call themselves
the Circle.

5
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:12,038
What gives them the right
to mess up our station?

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,844
They're an extremist faction

7
00:00:13,883 --> 00:00:16,410
who believe in Bajor
for the Bajorans.

8
00:00:16,454 --> 00:00:18,424
I can't loan you
a Starfleet runabout

9
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:20,485
without knowing
where you plan on taking it.

10
00:00:20,528 --> 00:00:24,262
To Cardassia IV to rescue
a Bajoran prisoner of war.

11
00:00:27,741 --> 00:00:28,709
Come on.

12
00:00:28,743 --> 00:00:30,770
We have a ship waiting.

13
00:00:30,814 --> 00:00:34,878
What you did today, Major,
was declare war on Cardassia.

14
00:00:34,921 --> 00:00:36,823
Thankfully, they declined
the invitation.

15
00:00:36,857 --> 00:00:39,020
What if I told you
that I knew someone

16
00:00:39,062 --> 00:00:41,055
who could bring
stability to Bajor?

17
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:43,433
Someone who could
unite the factions

18
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,063
and give us a chance
to do our job?

19
00:00:45,106 --> 00:00:47,975
Bajor doesn't need a man.

20
00:00:48,011 --> 00:00:52,178
It needs a symbol,
and that's what you are.

21
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:55,555
The Navarch needed to return
here to assume his new post.

22
00:00:55,591 --> 00:00:58,995
He's been made the Bajoran
Liaison Officer to Deep Space 9.

23
00:00:59,031 --> 00:01:01,661
I already have
a liaison officer.

24
00:01:01,702 --> 00:01:03,364
Not anymore, you don't.

25
00:01:03,406 --> 00:01:06,104
Major Kira is no longer
assigned to this post.

26
00:01:06,144 --> 00:01:08,444
She's been recalled to Bajor.

27
00:01:08,482 --> 00:01:11,852
And now, the continuation.

28
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:22,002
Frankly, Commander,
I'm surprised at your reaction.

29
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:26,903
Oh, I don't think much
surprises you, Minister.

30
00:01:26,948 --> 00:01:30,443
But I was expecting you
to be celebrating.

31
00:01:30,487 --> 00:01:31,580
I was under the impression

32
00:01:31,623 --> 00:01:33,421
Major Kira has been
nothing but trouble...

33
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,826
Who gave you that impression?

34
00:01:36,632 --> 00:01:38,066
Common knowledge.

35
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:40,435
Major Kira
has my complete respect.

36
00:01:40,472 --> 00:01:41,735
She's been invaluable

37
00:01:41,774 --> 00:01:43,767
in establishing
this command post

38
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,908
and now she's been dismissed
without anyone consulting me

39
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,384
and I don't appreciate it.

40
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,824
Commander, Starfleet
doesn't consult us

41
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:53,988
when they wish to promote
one of their officers.

42
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,227
Are you suggesting that this
is a promotion for Kira?

43
00:01:56,267 --> 00:01:58,099
Certainly, it is.

44
00:01:58,137 --> 00:02:00,130
We need to find
the proper spot for her.

45
00:02:00,174 --> 00:02:03,145
After all, she's the one
who brought Li Nalas back to us.

46
00:02:04,315 --> 00:02:07,343
Well, then,
that's a different matter.

47
00:02:11,228 --> 00:02:12,992
I'm glad you see it.

48
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,932
Yes, of course I do.

49
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,131
For a minute,
I was thinking to myself

50
00:02:17,172 --> 00:02:19,938
"There's a warm wind
blowing in from Minicoy."

51
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,015
I'm sorry?

52
00:02:27,056 --> 00:02:29,083
It's just
an old saying from Earth.

53
00:02:29,126 --> 00:02:32,428
It all started with a famous
ambassador from Minicoy

54
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:35,301
who used to bluster,
exaggerate and dissemble

55
00:02:35,371 --> 00:02:36,737
to get what he wanted.

56
00:02:36,773 --> 00:02:38,435
Not at all like you or me.

57
00:02:38,477 --> 00:02:40,640
He was a bag of hot air

58
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,811
and everyone recognized him
for what he was.

59
00:02:43,853 --> 00:02:48,260
May I assume you're satisfied
with the assignment of Li

60
00:02:48,295 --> 00:02:50,322
to fill your vacant post?

61
00:02:50,398 --> 00:02:52,026
I'd thought you'd want Li
to stay in the capital

62
00:02:52,068 --> 00:02:53,832
to strengthen
the provisional government.

63
00:02:53,871 --> 00:02:56,740
Frankly, I'm not sure
it's safe in the capital

64
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,837
with what's going on these days.

65
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,178
The Circle?

66
00:03:00,215 --> 00:03:02,685
The fires and graffiti
were a nuisance

67
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,018
but two days ago

68
00:03:04,056 --> 00:03:07,290
one of my fellow Ministers
was attacked and beaten.

69
00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:10,961
We can't risk the same thing
happening to Li Nalas.

70
00:03:15,844 --> 00:03:17,905
Look at it this way, Commander.

71
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:22,080
We're entrusting
Bajor's greatest hero to you.

72
00:03:22,122 --> 00:03:23,090
Could you have

73
00:03:23,123 --> 00:03:25,320
a better liaison
officer than Li Nalas?

74
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:26,989
I think not.

75
00:03:30,036 --> 00:03:31,972
Commander, your son
has been waiting

76
00:03:32,006 --> 00:03:33,440
to speak to you on the com.

77
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:36,677
Jake?

78
00:03:36,714 --> 00:03:38,342
Dad?
I'm outside our quarters.

79
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,284
Could you come down
for a minute?

80
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:41,687
Is something wrong?

81
00:03:41,723 --> 00:03:44,193
I really think you ought
to come down, Dad.

82
00:03:44,228 --> 00:03:46,060
On my way.

83
00:03:50,572 --> 00:03:52,234
What's the problem?

84
00:03:52,276 --> 00:03:53,403
Look.

85
00:06:02,243 --> 00:06:03,575
Come in.

86
00:06:07,452 --> 00:06:08,750
You're not?

87
00:06:08,788 --> 00:06:09,756
Leaving?

88
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,088
I really don't have
much choice, do I?

89
00:06:11,126 --> 00:06:12,617
You're not just leaving, Major.

90
00:06:12,662 --> 00:06:13,687
You're surrendering.

91
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,700
You break the rules, you pay.

92
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:16,701
Wait a minute.

93
00:06:16,735 --> 00:06:18,363
I want to be sure
I heard that correctly

94
00:06:18,405 --> 00:06:20,237
because it doesn't sound
like the Kira Nerys

95
00:06:20,275 --> 00:06:22,609
who has made a career
out of breaking the rules.

96
00:06:22,646 --> 00:06:24,137
Well, I guess I broke
one too many.

97
00:06:24,182 --> 00:06:26,277
Major, you've been
breaking one too many

98
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,618
for 14½ years.

99
00:06:27,655 --> 00:06:30,889
Cardassian rules, Bajoran
rules, Federation rules...

100
00:06:30,927 --> 00:06:32,863
they're all meaningless to you

101
00:06:32,898 --> 00:06:35,061
because you have a personal code

102
00:06:35,102 --> 00:06:36,900
that's always mattered more

103
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:40,308
and I'm sorry to say,
you're in slim company.

104
00:06:40,345 --> 00:06:42,440
I'll miss you too, Odo.

105
00:06:46,255 --> 00:06:48,452
Have you asked Sisko for help?

106
00:06:48,493 --> 00:06:51,487
I'm sure he'll do whatever he
thinks is best for the station.

107
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:53,328
You haven't even gone to him?

108
00:06:53,368 --> 00:06:55,166
Well, what do you
want me to do, Odo?

109
00:06:55,205 --> 00:06:56,833
Fight for what you want!
It's what you do best!

110
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,740
Well, maybe I just want
a vacation.

111
00:06:58,778 --> 00:07:01,180
Ach! Idiotic bureaucracy!

112
00:07:01,216 --> 00:07:04,552
Now, I suppose they'll expect
me to break in a new man.

113
00:07:04,588 --> 00:07:07,423
A great man... Li Nalas
can handle the job, believe me.

114
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,053
Well, you did fairly well at it

115
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,771
once I smoothed
your rough edges.

116
00:07:10,904 --> 00:07:12,372
Hah.

117
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:13,999
What's so funny?

118
00:07:14,044 --> 00:07:16,537
I thought you did fairly well

119
00:07:16,582 --> 00:07:18,916
once I smoothed
your rough edges.

120
00:07:20,422 --> 00:07:21,549
Yes?

121
00:07:21,591 --> 00:07:22,718
Am I disturbing anything?

122
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:23,727
Stick around.

123
00:07:23,761 --> 00:07:25,229
You can help me cry
in my synthale.

124
00:07:25,264 --> 00:07:27,325
I thought I should return
this epidellic lotion.

125
00:07:27,368 --> 00:07:28,563
No. If you like it...

126
00:07:28,604 --> 00:07:29,127
Oh, it's wonderful.

127
00:07:29,171 --> 00:07:30,400
Well, then keep it.

128
00:07:30,506 --> 00:07:31,838
How can you be chatting
about skin lotion

129
00:07:31,876 --> 00:07:33,401
at a time like this?

130
00:07:33,445 --> 00:07:35,415
Do you have any idea
where you'll be stationed?

131
00:07:35,515 --> 00:07:36,414
Come in.
Not yet.

132
00:07:36,517 --> 00:07:38,315
They say that after I've
taken some leave time

133
00:07:38,354 --> 00:07:39,322
I've earned a desk

134
00:07:39,356 --> 00:07:41,588
at the Foreign Affairs
Building somewhere.

135
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,595
Doctor.

136
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:43,597
Foreign Affairs Building?

137
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:44,599
I came to give you my best.

138
00:07:44,632 --> 00:07:45,600
Well, that's rather dull.

139
00:07:45,634 --> 00:07:46,602
I beg your pardon?

140
00:07:46,636 --> 00:07:47,763
Dull is a polite word for it.

141
00:07:47,804 --> 00:07:48,863
Doctor, if you were Kira

142
00:07:48,907 --> 00:07:51,173
wouldn't you at least be
complaining to Commander Sisko?

143
00:07:51,211 --> 00:07:53,545
Look, I just wanted
to wish you good luck.

144
00:07:53,582 --> 00:07:54,743
Thank you, Doctor.

145
00:07:54,784 --> 00:07:55,945
Complaining about what?

146
00:07:55,985 --> 00:07:57,453
Never mind, Doctor.

147
00:07:57,489 --> 00:07:59,459
If she doesn't care,
why should we?

148
00:07:59,525 --> 00:08:01,153
Have they given you
any reason yet?

149
00:08:01,195 --> 00:08:02,629
Did they give you
any alternative?

150
00:08:02,665 --> 00:08:03,792
I do care.
No, they haven't.

151
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:04,801
No, they didn't.

152
00:08:04,835 --> 00:08:06,167
I really ought
to finish packing.

153
00:08:06,204 --> 00:08:07,331
You said she doesn't care.

154
00:08:07,373 --> 00:08:09,239
You mean about
leaving the station?

155
00:08:09,276 --> 00:08:10,574
By all means, come on in.

156
00:08:10,612 --> 00:08:12,410
She's done well here.
She ought to stay here.

157
00:08:12,516 --> 00:08:14,075
And I say she could use
a little support

158
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,143
from her friends, Doctor.

159
00:08:15,187 --> 00:08:16,382
Well, yes, certainly, but...

160
00:08:16,423 --> 00:08:17,857
Uh...

161
00:08:17,892 --> 00:08:20,124
Chief! Come in.

162
00:08:20,163 --> 00:08:21,961
I didn't mean to intrude.

163
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:23,058
I was just...

164
00:08:23,101 --> 00:08:24,399
Don't worry, Chief,
it's all been said.

165
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:27,067
I have a good deal more to say,
thank you, Doctor.

166
00:08:27,108 --> 00:08:28,076
Look, I could come back.

167
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,203
Odo, leave her alone.

168
00:08:29,245 --> 00:08:30,611
This is Kira's
decision to make...

169
00:08:30,648 --> 00:08:32,777
unless, of course, you
want me to talk to Sisko.

170
00:08:32,819 --> 00:08:34,846
I knew what I was doing.
I knew the risk.

171
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,687
That's not what she asked.

172
00:08:36,726 --> 00:08:38,126
I'd just like to say, Major

173
00:08:38,161 --> 00:08:40,631
it's been a pleasure
serving with you.

174
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:41,793
Come in.

175
00:08:41,835 --> 00:08:43,737
Will someone please explain
this conversation to me?

176
00:08:43,772 --> 00:08:45,138
A party! Oh!

177
00:08:45,174 --> 00:08:47,303
For you, I would have reduced
my catering rate.

178
00:08:47,345 --> 00:08:48,313
It's not a party.

179
00:08:48,346 --> 00:08:49,314
Voodai.

180
00:08:49,348 --> 00:08:50,316
What's that?

181
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,818
A bottle of my favorite
synthale, I think.

182
00:08:51,853 --> 00:08:52,878
That's very thoughtful, Quark.

183
00:08:52,921 --> 00:08:54,480
It's also very small.

184
00:08:54,591 --> 00:08:57,027
I was anticipating
a far smaller gathering.

185
00:08:57,062 --> 00:08:59,589
I thought perhaps
an intimate farewell drink

186
00:08:59,633 --> 00:09:00,760
a sympathetic smile...

187
00:09:00,802 --> 00:09:02,430
a shoulder to cry on.

188
00:09:02,472 --> 00:09:03,440
As I was saying, Major...

189
00:09:03,473 --> 00:09:04,441
You'd be surprised

190
00:09:04,475 --> 00:09:05,443
how often that works with women.

191
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:06,443
Is this a joke?

192
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,445
Did you plan this?

193
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:09,141
Nobody could have planned this.

194
00:09:10,153 --> 00:09:11,348
Oh, we're open for business.

195
00:09:11,388 --> 00:09:12,583
Come on in, join the crowd.

196
00:09:12,624 --> 00:09:14,651
Vedek Bareil.

197
00:09:14,693 --> 00:09:17,459
I hope I'm not interrupting.

198
00:09:17,499 --> 00:09:18,797
No. Please come in.

199
00:09:18,835 --> 00:09:20,862
These are my...

200
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:26,078
these are my friends.

201
00:09:29,287 --> 00:09:33,192
I had no idea you were coming
to the space station.

202
00:09:33,227 --> 00:09:35,390
Well, nowadays,
it's probably wiser

203
00:09:35,431 --> 00:09:37,367
not to announce these things.

204
00:09:37,402 --> 00:09:39,030
How bad is it on Bajor, Vedek?

205
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:42,635
The violence has
seriously escalated.

206
00:09:42,678 --> 00:09:45,410
It almost seems there are
more weapons on the street now

207
00:09:45,449 --> 00:09:46,815
than during the occupation.

208
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:47,820
How could that be?

209
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,686
Where would they be coming from?

210
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:53,162
I try to concentrate
on more spiritual matters.

211
00:09:53,196 --> 00:09:54,494
Yes, of course.

212
00:09:54,532 --> 00:09:57,264
I mean... I didn't mean
to suggest that you...

213
00:09:57,303 --> 00:10:00,206
I understand
your duties here are finished.

214
00:10:00,243 --> 00:10:03,078
Yes, they are.

215
00:10:03,114 --> 00:10:06,017
Do you have any immediate plans?

216
00:10:10,427 --> 00:10:14,332
I haven't really had much chance
to give it any thought.

217
00:10:14,368 --> 00:10:17,966
Then perhaps I have
the perfect solution.

218
00:10:18,008 --> 00:10:21,845
Come and stay
at our monastery for a while.

219
00:10:21,881 --> 00:10:26,345
It can help when the spirit
gets a little bruised.

220
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,692
Thank you.

221
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:13,772
Major?

222
00:11:17,381 --> 00:11:19,783
I just want you to know that,
uh...

223
00:11:19,818 --> 00:11:24,350
if there's anything
I can do to help.

224
00:11:24,394 --> 00:11:26,364
Major...

225
00:11:26,398 --> 00:11:27,957
I'm sorry.

226
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,368
I didn't want this job.

227
00:11:32,408 --> 00:11:34,001
Neither did I.

228
00:11:35,113 --> 00:11:38,813
I mean, back when I was
sent here in the first place

229
00:11:38,853 --> 00:11:42,622
but it, um, turned out
better than I expected.

230
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,631
I'm sure it will
for you as well.

231
00:11:45,665 --> 00:11:49,468
I don't even know
what I'm supposed to do here.

232
00:11:49,505 --> 00:11:52,237
How does a "Navarch"

233
00:11:52,277 --> 00:11:55,647
fit into
this command structure?

234
00:11:55,683 --> 00:11:58,677
As I understand the position

235
00:11:58,723 --> 00:12:00,955
you report directly
to the Prophets

236
00:12:00,992 --> 00:12:03,622
but, from time to time,
I might ask your help.

237
00:12:03,732 --> 00:12:05,030
Commander

238
00:12:05,067 --> 00:12:11,409
anything you need from me,
I will try my best to do

239
00:12:11,445 --> 00:12:16,785
but I know that I can
never replace Major Kira.

240
00:12:16,821 --> 00:12:18,984
No one could.

241
00:12:21,095 --> 00:12:22,997
Thank you, sir.

242
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:28,698
Request permission to disembark.

243
00:12:30,379 --> 00:12:33,043
I'm going to get you back,
Major.

244
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:38,784
I promise that to both of us.

245
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,142
Docking Bay 3.

246
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,474
May I make
a friendly observation?

247
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:30,544
- It's crooked.
- It's crooked.

248
00:13:30,587 --> 00:13:33,057
I've been adjusting it
for an hour.

249
00:13:33,092 --> 00:13:34,526
It looks fine from over here

250
00:13:34,561 --> 00:13:36,497
but then I go
over there and it's...

251
00:13:39,103 --> 00:13:41,198
This isn't working, Bareil.

252
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:43,300
It's only a row of stones.

253
00:13:43,343 --> 00:13:45,073
No, it isn't.
It's me.

254
00:13:45,114 --> 00:13:46,742
The stones are straight.

255
00:13:46,816 --> 00:13:48,682
I'm the one who's crooked.

256
00:13:48,719 --> 00:13:52,158
Is that really
how you see yourself?

257
00:13:52,192 --> 00:13:53,490
Sometimes.

258
00:13:53,528 --> 00:13:56,522
Sometimes I even like
being that way.

259
00:14:05,483 --> 00:14:07,953
If I stay here much longer

260
00:14:07,988 --> 00:14:11,188
I'm sure I could destroy
your entire arboretum.

261
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:14,357
Well, perhaps you'd
rather try your hand

262
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,265
at woodcrafts.

263
00:14:17,739 --> 00:14:20,039
Can I tell you something
very personal?

264
00:14:20,077 --> 00:14:21,545
Of course.

265
00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:23,275
You won't tell?

266
00:14:23,315 --> 00:14:24,751
I'm a Vedek.

267
00:14:24,884 --> 00:14:29,689
I have absolutely
no artistic skills.

268
00:14:29,726 --> 00:14:32,697
I was the worst finger painter
at the four-year-old level.

269
00:14:32,732 --> 00:14:34,166
My parents were humiliated.

270
00:14:34,202 --> 00:14:36,536
It'll be our secret.

271
00:14:36,573 --> 00:14:39,373
The point is...

272
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:41,904
I'm useless here.

273
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:43,645
So?

274
00:14:43,685 --> 00:14:48,126
So?
I need to feel useful.

275
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,156
It might be interesting
to explore useless for a while...

276
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,170
see how it feels.

277
00:14:54,204 --> 00:14:56,070
Oh...

278
00:14:56,107 --> 00:14:59,307
Well, you don't know me.

279
00:14:59,347 --> 00:15:01,817
I'm beginning to.

280
00:15:04,122 --> 00:15:06,854
It's time, isn't it?

281
00:15:08,096 --> 00:15:09,758
Time?

282
00:15:09,798 --> 00:15:11,859
Come inside with me.

283
00:15:11,903 --> 00:15:13,896
I really should finish...

284
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,933
Come.

285
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:39,108
I've never been to this part
of the monastery before.

286
00:15:39,152 --> 00:15:42,613
May it be the first
of many visits.

287
00:15:42,658 --> 00:15:45,789
Bareil, maybe we
should talk about...

288
00:15:57,351 --> 00:15:59,685
Oh, Bareil...

289
00:15:59,722 --> 00:16:02,990
all my life, I dreamed of this.

290
00:16:18,355 --> 00:16:21,292
It is the Third Orb...

291
00:16:21,327 --> 00:16:24,321
the Orb of Prophecy and Change.

292
00:16:30,444 --> 00:16:33,074
What do I do?

293
00:16:33,115 --> 00:16:36,713
Be useless, Nerys.

294
00:16:36,755 --> 00:16:40,854
Allow the Prophets to guide you.

295
00:16:49,611 --> 00:16:52,377
The Chamber of Ministers.

296
00:16:53,819 --> 00:16:54,946
Dax.

297
00:16:54,987 --> 00:16:56,455
Listen to them, Kira.

298
00:16:56,491 --> 00:16:57,925
I can't hear them.

299
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,428
It's all right.

300
00:16:59,463 --> 00:17:00,954
Listen.

301
00:17:07,711 --> 00:17:10,375
Can you hear them now, child?

302
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:13,182
I hear them, Major.

303
00:17:13,221 --> 00:17:15,783
They're calling to me.

304
00:17:15,825 --> 00:17:17,920
Don't listen to him, Nerys.

305
00:17:17,963 --> 00:17:21,766
Allow yourself to hear them.

306
00:17:21,803 --> 00:17:24,467
They're calling to you.

307
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,573
Blasphemy.

308
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,418
Listen to them, Nerys.

309
00:17:31,453 --> 00:17:32,978
Help me to hear them.

310
00:17:33,023 --> 00:17:34,993
I don't know how.

311
00:17:35,026 --> 00:17:37,360
But you do.

312
00:17:45,846 --> 00:17:47,839
You do.

313
00:18:04,012 --> 00:18:06,005
You do.

314
00:18:23,013 --> 00:18:24,845
Last night alone,
we had dozens of beatings.

315
00:18:24,882 --> 00:18:25,941
They're everywhere...

316
00:18:25,985 --> 00:18:27,180
till we go looking for them

317
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,381
and then they're nowhere.

318
00:18:28,422 --> 00:18:30,517
Which would suggest
they have powerful friends

319
00:18:30,627 --> 00:18:32,425
to warn them and protect them.

320
00:18:32,463 --> 00:18:33,761
Probably.

321
00:18:33,798 --> 00:18:35,232
We've got to put a stop to this

322
00:18:35,269 --> 00:18:36,532
before it gets out of hand.

323
00:18:36,571 --> 00:18:38,039
Now, the provisional government

324
00:18:38,073 --> 00:18:39,701
is bringing troops
into the capital.

325
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,870
Troops?

326
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,539
That will put an end
to the Circle.

327
00:18:42,614 --> 00:18:45,848
And you keep your eyes open
up there, old friend.

328
00:18:47,223 --> 00:18:48,555
I always do.

329
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,532
No, I haven't made any progress

330
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:54,694
in finding the ones
who assaulted you.

331
00:18:54,736 --> 00:18:56,034
It's over, Odo.

332
00:18:56,072 --> 00:18:57,472
The investigation isn't closed.

333
00:18:57,508 --> 00:18:58,533
It's just...

334
00:18:58,576 --> 00:19:00,044
You don't understand.

335
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:01,206
It's over.

336
00:19:01,248 --> 00:19:02,648
What are you talking about?

337
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:03,709
Everything.

338
00:19:03,752 --> 00:19:06,052
Bajor, the provisional
government

339
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:08,219
the Federation being here...
all of it.

340
00:19:08,261 --> 00:19:09,524
We got to leave.

341
00:19:09,596 --> 00:19:10,996
Well, I do anyway.

342
00:19:11,032 --> 00:19:13,161
You can just turn into a couch.

343
00:19:13,203 --> 00:19:15,673
You mean because
of this Circle business?

344
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,837
They're just
a bunch of hooligans

345
00:19:17,878 --> 00:19:20,007
who use violence
to get attention.

346
00:19:20,048 --> 00:19:22,678
I happen to know
they have enough weapons

347
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,714
and explosives and supplies
to support an army.

348
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:28,229
How do you know that?

349
00:19:28,263 --> 00:19:30,233
I've been asking questions
of people

350
00:19:30,266 --> 00:19:32,429
who don't answer questions
from people like you.

351
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:35,033
Where would the Circle
be getting so many weapons?

352
00:19:35,075 --> 00:19:36,100
The Kressari.

353
00:19:36,144 --> 00:19:37,442
The Kressari?

354
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,108
That doesn't make any sense.

355
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,416
The Kressari
don't even have a military.

356
00:19:41,453 --> 00:19:42,921
They're botanic DNA traders.

357
00:19:42,957 --> 00:19:45,951
Well, they're not
delivering flowers these days.

358
00:19:45,995 --> 00:19:47,988
I know, Odo.

359
00:19:49,502 --> 00:19:52,473
Computer, when's the next
Kressari vessel due here?

360
00:19:52,507 --> 00:19:54,807
The Kressari Vessel <i>Calondon</i>

361
00:19:54,844 --> 00:19:58,806
is scheduled to arrive
in 36 hours.

362
00:20:00,655 --> 00:20:02,351
Do you know
where these weapons

363
00:20:02,391 --> 00:20:03,916
are being sent to on Bajor?

364
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,155
No, not exactly.

365
00:20:05,196 --> 00:20:06,255
Find out.

366
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:08,268
Are you out of your mind?

367
00:20:08,302 --> 00:20:11,763
My plan is to put
as much distance as possible

368
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:14,109
between me and Bajor,
thank you very much.

369
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:18,650
Quark, I hate to do this,
but I guess I'll have to.

370
00:20:18,687 --> 00:20:19,655
That's not fair.

371
00:20:19,689 --> 00:20:21,089
I haven't done anything yet.

372
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,525
Whatever you're going to do,
it's not fair.

373
00:20:22,561 --> 00:20:23,324
You're a deputy.

374
00:20:23,362 --> 00:20:25,332
It's not... what?

375
00:20:25,366 --> 00:20:26,334
You're a deputy.

376
00:20:26,367 --> 00:20:27,335
I want you to find out

377
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:28,997
where the weapons
are going on Bajor.

378
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,771
Meanwhile...

379
00:20:31,811 --> 00:20:32,972
I'm going to find out

380
00:20:33,013 --> 00:20:34,915
exactly where
they're coming from.

381
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,079
You and me, a team?

382
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,884
That's right.

383
00:20:45,235 --> 00:20:46,203
Good-bye.

384
00:20:46,237 --> 00:20:48,537
Either that
or I'm putting you in a cell.

385
00:20:48,574 --> 00:20:50,065
That's not fair.

386
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,635
On what charge?

387
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,707
Impeding an investigation...

388
00:20:53,817 --> 00:20:55,683
unless you want
to reveal the identities

389
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,280
of the people
you've been talking to.

390
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:58,313
You know I can't do that.

391
00:20:59,761 --> 00:21:01,229
It's your choice.

392
00:21:01,264 --> 00:21:03,860
You're a deputy
or you're a prisoner.

393
00:21:06,477 --> 00:21:09,073
I'm a deputy.

394
00:21:13,056 --> 00:21:15,026
I've got to go to Bajor.

395
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:16,527
Odo has some information

396
00:21:16,562 --> 00:21:17,825
that suggests
we may be facing a coup

397
00:21:17,864 --> 00:21:19,025
and I've got to check
things out.

398
00:21:19,066 --> 00:21:20,329
Is there any way I can help?

399
00:21:20,369 --> 00:21:23,238
Your military contacts...
see if you can get a feeling

400
00:21:23,274 --> 00:21:26,109
for how much support
the provisional government has.

401
00:21:26,146 --> 00:21:28,139
No problem. What about the
station while you're gone?

402
00:21:28,183 --> 00:21:30,983
Dax and Mr. O'Brien
can handle things in Ops.

403
00:21:31,022 --> 00:21:32,490
If you need any other help...

404
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:33,890
Help?
I can't even sneeze

405
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:36,226
without three people
handing me handkerchiefs

406
00:21:36,264 --> 00:21:37,357
but I was thinking

407
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,461
we might want
to establish a curfew.

408
00:21:39,504 --> 00:21:41,633
Another cargo bay was
vandalized last night.

409
00:21:41,674 --> 00:21:42,642
Good idea.

410
00:21:42,675 --> 00:21:45,373
I've asked Odo
to assign you a bodyguard.

411
00:21:45,414 --> 00:21:46,507
Oh, it's not necessary.

412
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:47,847
I think it is.

413
00:21:47,885 --> 00:21:49,217
Docking Bay 1.

414
00:21:57,602 --> 00:22:00,870
Woodcrafts...
definitely the way to go.

415
00:22:00,909 --> 00:22:02,741
Is that where the Prophets
led you?

416
00:22:02,778 --> 00:22:06,444
Yeah. Lots of, uh,
hammers and nails and saws

417
00:22:06,485 --> 00:22:08,010
surrounded by monks
and Vedeks...

418
00:22:08,055 --> 00:22:09,080
very safe and secure.

419
00:22:09,123 --> 00:22:11,355
You don't want to talk about it.

420
00:22:11,394 --> 00:22:13,694
No.

421
00:22:19,476 --> 00:22:23,245
Can I tell you something
very personal?

422
00:22:23,282 --> 00:22:26,219
I'm not a Vedek,
but I can keep a secret.

423
00:22:26,254 --> 00:22:29,590
The last time
I encountered the Third Orb

424
00:22:29,627 --> 00:22:31,927
you were part of my vision.

425
00:22:31,965 --> 00:22:33,958
Me?

426
00:22:34,001 --> 00:22:36,972
It's the reason
I came to the station

427
00:22:37,007 --> 00:22:39,307
to invite you here.

428
00:22:39,345 --> 00:22:40,813
What...

429
00:22:40,847 --> 00:22:44,513
what part did I play
in your vision?

430
00:22:44,554 --> 00:22:46,524
It's not important.

431
00:22:46,557 --> 00:22:50,553
I was just wondering
if I was part of yours.

432
00:22:52,067 --> 00:22:53,899
No. No, you weren't.

433
00:22:55,406 --> 00:22:58,970
How could there be a storm
on a day as lovely as this?

434
00:22:59,013 --> 00:23:00,003
That's not thunder.

435
00:23:00,048 --> 00:23:01,846
I know that sound.
That's gunfire.

436
00:23:01,885 --> 00:23:06,086
What a pleasure to come upon
such a flowing exchange

437
00:23:06,126 --> 00:23:09,097
of spiritual harmony.

438
00:23:09,131 --> 00:23:10,394
Vedek Winn.

439
00:23:10,501 --> 00:23:14,065
We've met before,
haven't we... Major?

440
00:23:14,106 --> 00:23:15,335
Major...

441
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:16,900
Kira Nerys.

442
00:23:16,946 --> 00:23:19,212
That's right.

443
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,684
Major Kira.

444
00:23:20,719 --> 00:23:23,019
From the space station.

445
00:23:23,057 --> 00:23:24,423
What brings you here?

446
00:23:24,459 --> 00:23:26,793
I do, Vedek Winn.

447
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:29,062
Good for you, Vedek Bareil.

448
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,937
After working so hard,
you deserve a little recreation.

449
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:37,544
Major Kira is here
to explore her <i>pagh.</i>

450
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,451
A worthy endeavor
for someone who has led

451
00:23:40,487 --> 00:23:42,548
such a life of violence, child.

452
00:23:42,591 --> 00:23:45,653
And I'm sure the Assembly
would have had no objection

453
00:23:45,697 --> 00:23:48,463
to your encounter with an Orb

454
00:23:48,502 --> 00:23:50,334
had Vedek Bareil consulted us.

455
00:23:50,372 --> 00:23:53,708
No one has ever been held
to that formality.

456
00:23:53,745 --> 00:23:55,407
You're right, of course.

457
00:23:55,447 --> 00:23:59,716
But I've always consulted
with the Assembly in advance.

458
00:23:59,756 --> 00:24:01,851
I think of it as a courtesy.

459
00:24:01,893 --> 00:24:04,329
Nothing more, nothing less.

460
00:24:04,364 --> 00:24:07,130
How long will you be with us,
Major?

461
00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:09,105
I'm not sure.

462
00:24:09,139 --> 00:24:14,103
Feel free to stay as many days
as you like.

463
00:24:14,148 --> 00:24:16,014
Even a week, if necessary.

464
00:24:29,376 --> 00:24:31,812
Have them withdraw
from the northeast quadrant.

465
00:24:31,847 --> 00:24:32,974
Move them to join

466
00:24:33,015 --> 00:24:35,178
the 14th column
south of the city.

467
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:46,799
General Krim.

468
00:24:46,841 --> 00:24:49,437
I'm Benjamin Sisko.

469
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:51,311
We met during a session

470
00:24:51,348 --> 00:24:52,816
of the Executive
Committee last year.

471
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:55,515
I remember, Commander.

472
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:58,493
I was impressed by your talk.

473
00:24:58,528 --> 00:25:01,021
As I recall, you disagreed
with all of it.

474
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:02,261
Yes.

475
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:04,601
But you presented
your arguments well.

476
00:25:04,639 --> 00:25:06,301
What can I do for you?

477
00:25:06,342 --> 00:25:08,437
I understand you're in command

478
00:25:08,479 --> 00:25:10,415
of the forces
defending the city.

479
00:25:10,449 --> 00:25:12,976
I'd hardly call it
defending the city.

480
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,716
There is concern
in some quarters

481
00:25:14,757 --> 00:25:16,487
that the military is unwilling

482
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,894
to confront the forces
of the Circle.

483
00:25:18,931 --> 00:25:21,595
I don't know with whom
you've been speaking, Commander.

484
00:25:21,636 --> 00:25:23,629
I've been observing
troop movements.

485
00:25:23,673 --> 00:25:26,303
Every time there is
a potential confrontation

486
00:25:26,344 --> 00:25:28,871
the military withdraws
to a safer position.

487
00:25:28,916 --> 00:25:31,648
You can't possibly appreciate

488
00:25:31,687 --> 00:25:34,351
that this is Bajoran
against Bajoran.

489
00:25:34,393 --> 00:25:37,262
I appreciate that the
provisional government

490
00:25:37,298 --> 00:25:40,235
will stand only
if the military supports it.

491
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,704
We are all patriots, Commander.

492
00:25:44,744 --> 00:25:45,837
We have intelligence

493
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,510
that the Circle is being armed
by the Kressari.

494
00:25:48,551 --> 00:25:50,042
The Kressari?

495
00:25:54,328 --> 00:25:56,389
I hadn't heard that.

496
00:25:56,432 --> 00:25:58,230
We've been trying
to track the movement

497
00:25:58,269 --> 00:25:59,237
of those shipments.

498
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,295
If we could determine

499
00:26:00,339 --> 00:26:01,807
where they're stored,
then we can...

500
00:26:01,841 --> 00:26:03,309
I'd like to know.

501
00:26:03,345 --> 00:26:05,508
You'll be the first one
I contact.

502
00:26:05,615 --> 00:26:07,710
Thank you.

503
00:26:07,752 --> 00:26:10,484
There is one other thing,
General.

504
00:26:10,524 --> 00:26:14,224
My First Officer,
Major Kira Nerys...

505
00:26:14,264 --> 00:26:16,028
Yes, I know Major Kira.

506
00:26:16,067 --> 00:26:19,665
I understand
she hasn't been reassigned yet.

507
00:26:19,707 --> 00:26:22,873
It would mean a great deal to me
to get her back.

508
00:26:22,913 --> 00:26:24,940
That's out of my purview,
Commander.

509
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:28,387
You might want to discuss it
with Minister Jaro.

510
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:34,927
Commander Sisko...

511
00:26:36,504 --> 00:26:38,234
you told me about the Kressari

512
00:26:38,274 --> 00:26:40,767
before you asked the favor
regarding Kira.

513
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:48,421
You could have tried
to trade that information

514
00:26:48,459 --> 00:26:49,586
for the favor.

515
00:26:49,661 --> 00:26:52,325
I wouldn't do that.

516
00:26:53,435 --> 00:26:55,598
I'll remember that about you.

517
00:27:00,843 --> 00:27:03,109
He's calling again.

518
00:27:06,853 --> 00:27:09,415
What do you think we should do?

519
00:27:09,459 --> 00:27:13,592
I think he's getting
tired of seeing me smile.

520
00:27:14,635 --> 00:27:17,265
Anything new
from O'Brien or Odo?

521
00:27:17,306 --> 00:27:19,606
They haven't come up
with anything yet.

522
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,882
All right.

523
00:27:26,923 --> 00:27:28,789
Put him on the screen.

524
00:27:28,827 --> 00:27:31,696
I will give this a try.

525
00:27:31,731 --> 00:27:34,258
I am First Officer Li Nalas.

526
00:27:34,303 --> 00:27:36,967
Can I help you?

527
00:27:37,008 --> 00:27:39,672
Somebody better be able
to help me.

528
00:27:39,713 --> 00:27:42,309
I have been delayed
for six hours.

529
00:27:42,351 --> 00:27:45,915
I can assure you
the Kressari government

530
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:47,860
will lodge a formal protest.

531
00:27:47,894 --> 00:27:49,123
My apologies.

532
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,496
Apparently, there has been
some confusion

533
00:27:51,534 --> 00:27:53,127
with your manifest interface

534
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:56,039
in our computer inventory
system that had to be...

535
00:27:56,076 --> 00:27:57,874
Yes, yes.
I know all of that.

536
00:27:57,912 --> 00:28:01,146
I didn't know they were going
to be opening

537
00:28:01,218 --> 00:28:03,711
every container
in my cargo hold!

538
00:28:03,756 --> 00:28:06,887
Do you understand
these are highly sensitive

539
00:28:06,928 --> 00:28:08,726
herbaceous materials?

540
00:28:08,765 --> 00:28:12,295
I am sure that all necessary
precautions are being taken.

541
00:28:12,338 --> 00:28:15,275
This is ridiculous.
I have a schedule to keep!

542
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,974
We should be able to have this
all cleared up in a few minutes.

543
00:28:18,015 --> 00:28:21,283
That's what I was told
a few hours ago.

544
00:28:28,668 --> 00:28:31,138
Dax to O'Brien.

545
00:28:31,172 --> 00:28:33,142
Yes, Lieutenant?

546
00:28:33,175 --> 00:28:35,236
We don't want to hold up
the Kressari

547
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:36,804
any longer than necessary.

548
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:39,979
Well, there isn't much more
we can accomplish for now.

549
00:28:40,021 --> 00:28:42,287
The ship's due back here
the day after tomorrow.

550
00:28:42,326 --> 00:28:45,320
Perhaps we'll be able to correct
any additional problems then.

551
00:28:45,364 --> 00:28:47,493
Yeah, we'd come
to the same conclusion.

552
00:28:47,535 --> 00:28:49,197
O'Brien out.

553
00:28:50,206 --> 00:28:52,870
A fair voyage to you, Captain.

554
00:28:56,117 --> 00:28:58,212
Prepare for immediate departure.

555
00:29:12,847 --> 00:29:14,509
Major.

556
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:19,151
Commander.
I didn't hear you.

557
00:29:22,498 --> 00:29:26,301
I'm sorry if I interrupted
your meditation.

558
00:29:26,338 --> 00:29:28,102
Daydream.

559
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,268
Daydreaming...

560
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:34,182
I think I remember doing that
a long, long time ago.

561
00:29:34,218 --> 00:29:36,814
I've discovered
it's like riding a bicycle.

562
00:29:36,856 --> 00:29:38,985
It comes back to you
right away.

563
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,463
Can I bring you
back to reality for a minute?

564
00:29:41,498 --> 00:29:44,060
Back to reality...

565
00:29:44,103 --> 00:29:46,699
or back to DS9?

566
00:29:46,741 --> 00:29:48,768
Are you still interested?

567
00:29:48,812 --> 00:29:51,510
A lot has happened here.

568
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:57,187
I encountered an Orb,
Commander.

569
00:29:57,227 --> 00:30:00,757
It's given me
a great deal to think about.

570
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,770
They do have a way
of doing that, don't they?

571
00:30:05,741 --> 00:30:06,936
Well...

572
00:30:06,977 --> 00:30:10,211
I just came to let you know
that we haven't given up yet

573
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,218
but for the moment

574
00:30:11,252 --> 00:30:12,743
there seem to be
some bigger problems

575
00:30:12,788 --> 00:30:13,881
for the leaders down here.

576
00:30:13,923 --> 00:30:17,259
I heard the gunfire
in the distance.

577
00:30:17,296 --> 00:30:20,598
That distance is getting closer.

578
00:30:20,635 --> 00:30:23,105
The Circle is for real, Major.

579
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,474
They've been armed for a coup.

580
00:30:25,511 --> 00:30:27,504
And I'm not at all convinced
that the military

581
00:30:27,548 --> 00:30:29,950
is going to back
the provisional government.

582
00:30:29,986 --> 00:30:32,957
I didn't realize it...

583
00:30:35,295 --> 00:30:38,164
We've been so isolated.

584
00:30:39,369 --> 00:30:41,965
Well...

585
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:44,603
I guess I'd better get back.

586
00:30:44,646 --> 00:30:46,512
Commander...

587
00:30:47,951 --> 00:30:50,581
Me, too.

588
00:30:51,991 --> 00:30:54,928
I told you I haven't given up.

589
00:31:26,354 --> 00:31:27,822
Begin transport.

590
00:31:34,869 --> 00:31:37,533
I think you'll find
everything's in order.

591
00:31:43,384 --> 00:31:44,750
Very well.

592
00:31:44,787 --> 00:31:46,780
If you'll sign off
on the shipment

593
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:48,052
we'll be on our way.

594
00:31:51,999 --> 00:31:53,558
Return transport.

595
00:32:11,368 --> 00:32:13,361
Good afternoon.

596
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:29,690
So... you're involved
with the Circle.

597
00:32:29,735 --> 00:32:31,033
I am the Circle, Major.

598
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:33,165
Now I understand why you wanted

599
00:32:33,207 --> 00:32:35,643
to ship Li Nalas
off to the station.

600
00:32:35,678 --> 00:32:38,376
The last thing I need right now
is a great war hero

601
00:32:38,484 --> 00:32:40,977
capturing the devotion
of the Bajoran people.

602
00:32:41,021 --> 00:32:43,491
How can you betray
your own government?

603
00:32:43,526 --> 00:32:45,826
Major, I don't have to tell you.

604
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:48,493
I've heard your opinion
of this government.

605
00:32:48,535 --> 00:32:49,764
Government?

606
00:32:49,804 --> 00:32:51,706
They can't even agree
it is a government

607
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,231
so they call it "provisional."

608
00:32:53,276 --> 00:32:55,769
It's just another word
for powerless.

609
00:33:01,558 --> 00:33:05,190
I won't allow the Bajoran people
to be powerless anymore.

610
00:33:05,231 --> 00:33:07,793
We have been doormats

611
00:33:07,836 --> 00:33:10,534
to the Cardassians,
and now the Federation...

612
00:33:10,574 --> 00:33:12,874
any great power that happens by.

613
00:33:12,912 --> 00:33:15,041
We will not be that again.

614
00:33:15,082 --> 00:33:19,716
We are a people who brought art
and architecture

615
00:33:19,758 --> 00:33:20,987
to countless planets.

616
00:33:21,027 --> 00:33:22,929
We don't deserve to be victims.

617
00:33:22,963 --> 00:33:25,900
If you want to change
the government, Minister Jaro

618
00:33:25,935 --> 00:33:27,563
you vote to change it.

619
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:30,599
You don't sneak up
from behind it with a dagger.

620
00:33:30,643 --> 00:33:32,407
We'll discuss politics
at another time.

621
00:33:32,481 --> 00:33:35,783
I need to know, please,
what the Federation will do

622
00:33:35,819 --> 00:33:38,016
once our objective
becomes clear.

623
00:33:43,466 --> 00:33:46,562
Major, I've heard you have
no love for the Federation.

624
00:33:46,606 --> 00:33:48,268
I'm not an unreasonable man.

625
00:33:48,308 --> 00:33:50,072
I'm willing to send you back
to the station

626
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:51,307
if that's what you want.

627
00:33:51,348 --> 00:33:54,410
I'll give you that station
after we get rid of Starfleet.

628
00:33:54,453 --> 00:33:56,423
Now, do you believe
they will continue

629
00:33:56,457 --> 00:33:58,119
to support
the provisional government?

630
00:33:58,159 --> 00:33:59,787
How about our own military?

631
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:02,824
I'd worry about them first
if I were you.

632
00:34:04,704 --> 00:34:06,674
What will the Federation do,
Major?

633
00:34:06,708 --> 00:34:07,801
What will Sisko do?

634
00:34:07,844 --> 00:34:09,973
You know him better
than any Bajoran.

635
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:19,834
No one despises the Cardassians
more than I, Major

636
00:34:19,877 --> 00:34:23,145
but we did learn
a few things from them.

637
00:34:23,182 --> 00:34:26,119
Like how to encourage people
to talk.

638
00:34:26,155 --> 00:34:28,387
Let's go.

639
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:40,102
Bareil says there were
no signs of a struggle.

640
00:34:40,146 --> 00:34:42,207
Maybe somebody saw them leave.

641
00:34:42,283 --> 00:34:45,049
That's what we need to find out.

642
00:34:45,089 --> 00:34:47,457
What if they transported
her off the grounds?

643
00:34:47,493 --> 00:34:48,961
Let's hope they didn't.

644
00:34:48,996 --> 00:34:51,330
Now, we can't expect much help
from the local authorities.

645
00:34:51,367 --> 00:34:52,426
They've got their hands full.

646
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:56,033
Commander, I should be able
to get some cooperation.

647
00:34:56,075 --> 00:34:58,204
If my name carries any weight,
let's use it.

648
00:34:58,245 --> 00:34:59,110
Good.

649
00:34:59,147 --> 00:35:00,115
When's Odo due back?

650
00:35:00,149 --> 00:35:01,947
Not for another 12 hours.

651
00:35:01,985 --> 00:35:05,617
Who needs Odo when you've got
his number one deputy?

652
00:35:05,659 --> 00:35:07,561
Quark, this isn't the time.

653
00:35:07,596 --> 00:35:09,394
No, this is exactly the time.

654
00:35:09,432 --> 00:35:11,368
I think I know
where you can find Kira.

655
00:35:11,403 --> 00:35:12,462
Go on.

656
00:35:12,505 --> 00:35:15,705
You see, uh, Odo blackmailed me
into helping him.

657
00:35:15,743 --> 00:35:17,211
A matter which I've been meaning

658
00:35:17,313 --> 00:35:18,872
to bring to your attention,
Commander.

659
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:19,975
Quark.

660
00:35:20,018 --> 00:35:21,577
I managed to find out

661
00:35:21,621 --> 00:35:24,217
where the Circle's
headquarters is.

662
00:35:24,259 --> 00:35:26,855
In the labyrinths beneath
the Perikian peninsula.

663
00:35:26,897 --> 00:35:28,365
Sisko to security.

664
00:35:28,399 --> 00:35:29,628
Go ahead.

665
00:35:29,668 --> 00:35:31,227
I need a couple of officers

666
00:35:31,305 --> 00:35:33,366
to go on a rescue mission
to Bajor.

667
00:35:33,408 --> 00:35:34,899
Report to Runabout Pad C.

668
00:35:34,945 --> 00:35:35,913
On our way.

669
00:35:35,946 --> 00:35:38,246
Doctor, Lieutenant,
you're with me.

670
00:35:38,317 --> 00:35:41,517
Mr. O'Brien,
you'll be our pilot.

671
00:35:41,557 --> 00:35:42,718
Configure the runabout sensors

672
00:35:42,759 --> 00:35:44,091
for a full sweep
of the peninsula.

673
00:35:44,128 --> 00:35:46,428
Once we find the base,
I'll depending a great deal

674
00:35:46,466 --> 00:35:48,094
on your famous
transporter talents.

675
00:35:48,135 --> 00:35:49,103
Aye, sir.

676
00:35:49,137 --> 00:35:51,266
Commander, I'm going.

677
00:35:51,341 --> 00:35:52,969
No, it's too dangerous.

678
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:55,572
Don't you understand?
I can do this.

679
00:35:55,615 --> 00:35:57,812
I don't know what it means
to be a Navarch

680
00:35:57,853 --> 00:36:00,824
but I can fight in the trenches
and I take orders well.

681
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:04,126
Besides, I owe her one.

682
00:36:06,702 --> 00:36:08,638
Dax, you're in charge.

683
00:36:08,672 --> 00:36:11,199
We can discuss appropriate
compensation for this

684
00:36:11,244 --> 00:36:13,008
at a more convenient time!

685
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,460
Need one.

686
00:36:24,467 --> 00:36:27,233
Check all the settings
on those phasers.

687
00:36:28,474 --> 00:36:30,272
Two men, Sector B.

688
00:36:30,344 --> 00:36:31,505
Take your positions.

689
00:36:31,547 --> 00:36:32,845
Yes, sir.

690
00:36:47,341 --> 00:36:50,780
Only five, but they've got
more firearms

691
00:36:50,814 --> 00:36:52,510
than a Galaxy-class starship.

692
00:36:54,855 --> 00:36:57,519
Where the hell's it coming from?

693
00:36:58,863 --> 00:37:01,299
All right, straight power play.

694
00:37:01,334 --> 00:37:03,064
Nothing fancy.

695
00:37:03,103 --> 00:37:05,437
Expect heavy resistance.

696
00:37:05,474 --> 00:37:07,272
Anyone who finds Kira

697
00:37:07,344 --> 00:37:10,908
pin this on her, and call
for transport immediately.

698
00:37:12,654 --> 00:37:14,122
Let's do it.

699
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:25,675
Kira!

700
00:37:49,019 --> 00:37:52,081
Chief, get us out of here!

701
00:38:04,146 --> 00:38:06,742
We don't have time for this.

702
00:38:09,089 --> 00:38:11,150
Ow, ow.
Ouch.

703
00:38:11,192 --> 00:38:12,160
Do not talk.

704
00:38:12,194 --> 00:38:13,856
We have to assume
Jaro will move quickly

705
00:38:13,897 --> 00:38:15,092
now that we've got you back.

706
00:38:15,133 --> 00:38:16,601
Li is the only
chance we've got.

707
00:38:16,636 --> 00:38:17,968
Me?

708
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:20,999
Jaro knows you're the only
force that could stop him.

709
00:38:21,043 --> 00:38:23,570
If we could get him to the
Chamber of Ministers...

710
00:38:23,614 --> 00:38:24,741
It's much too great a risk.

711
00:38:24,783 --> 00:38:26,753
He'd be dead before he
had a chance to speak.

712
00:38:26,787 --> 00:38:28,916
Courtesy of a Cardassian weapon.

713
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:31,861
The Circle's being supplied
by the Cardassians.

714
00:38:31,896 --> 00:38:32,864
What?

715
00:38:32,898 --> 00:38:34,764
I borrowed the proof.

716
00:38:34,801 --> 00:38:37,704
It's got a Gul's thumb scan
on it.

717
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,676
The Circle hates
the Cardassians.

718
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,474
They don't know
it is the Cardassians.

719
00:38:41,514 --> 00:38:44,041
They think they've been buying
from Kressari traders.

720
00:38:44,085 --> 00:38:45,280
I don't understand.

721
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,811
Why would the Cardassians

722
00:38:46,856 --> 00:38:49,019
want to help Jaro
if he hates them?

723
00:38:49,061 --> 00:38:51,793
Because it gets them
what they want the most.

724
00:38:51,832 --> 00:38:52,891
Rid of us.

725
00:38:52,934 --> 00:38:54,562
They're just using Jaro.

726
00:38:54,603 --> 00:38:57,403
Once the Federation
is forced to leave...

727
00:38:57,442 --> 00:38:59,172
The Cardassians come back.

728
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:00,942
We've got to do something.

729
00:39:00,981 --> 00:39:02,917
I've got to do something.

730
00:39:05,724 --> 00:39:07,090
Sisko to Ops.

731
00:39:07,126 --> 00:39:08,355
Go ahead.

732
00:39:08,462 --> 00:39:10,728
Dax, open a channel to Bajor.

733
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:12,702
Tell them that Navarch Li Nalas

734
00:39:12,737 --> 00:39:15,903
wants to address the Chamber
of Ministers on subspace.

735
00:39:15,942 --> 00:39:17,604
I can't do it, Benjamin.

736
00:39:17,645 --> 00:39:20,138
All frequencies
to Bajor are jammed.

737
00:39:20,183 --> 00:39:23,211
We lost all communication with
the planet five minutes ago.

738
00:39:23,255 --> 00:39:24,746
Then, it has started.

739
00:39:27,429 --> 00:39:31,163
Get me Admiral Chekote
at Starfleet Command.

740
00:39:39,184 --> 00:39:43,818
I feel the Prophets
smiling on me today, Vedek.

741
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:47,889
The Prophets have rarely
encountered a <i>pagh</i>

742
00:39:47,933 --> 00:39:51,372
as forceful as yours,
Minister Jaro.

743
00:39:55,046 --> 00:39:58,017
So, what's it to be, Winn?

744
00:39:58,051 --> 00:40:00,180
Be?

745
00:40:00,222 --> 00:40:03,661
Don't tease me.

746
00:40:03,694 --> 00:40:07,861
I can't interpret
the prophecies for you, Essa.

747
00:40:07,902 --> 00:40:10,372
I know the future.

748
00:40:10,407 --> 00:40:12,468
It belongs to me.

749
00:40:12,578 --> 00:40:15,481
I don't need
your interpretation.

750
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:17,485
Then what?

751
00:40:17,587 --> 00:40:20,718
Your support.

752
00:40:20,758 --> 00:40:23,388
I've made it very clear
to you how I feel.

753
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:26,732
Your public support.

754
00:40:26,769 --> 00:40:31,403
Support from the Vedek
of an order so small as mine

755
00:40:31,445 --> 00:40:34,416
surely would not be significant.

756
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:42,090
You stand for a return...
to orthodox values, as do I.

757
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:44,760
We're a match
made by the Prophets.

758
00:40:44,801 --> 00:40:48,365
I wish there were more
with that opinion.

759
00:40:48,408 --> 00:40:50,844
Unfortunately, as my assembly

760
00:40:50,879 --> 00:40:54,045
approaches the selection
of a new Kai

761
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:57,387
I fear my voice is rarely heard.

762
00:40:57,424 --> 00:40:58,892
That can change.

763
00:40:58,928 --> 00:41:01,956
Can it?

764
00:41:01,999 --> 00:41:05,335
Think of the prestige of having
the new leader of Bajor

765
00:41:05,372 --> 00:41:07,204
being a member of your order.

766
00:41:09,046 --> 00:41:11,710
If you are the new leader.

767
00:41:13,553 --> 00:41:16,388
Have the Prophets given you
a reason to doubt it?

768
00:41:16,426 --> 00:41:18,953
I didn't say that.

769
00:41:23,738 --> 00:41:26,732
Then let them bless
my ascension.

770
00:41:26,777 --> 00:41:29,908
Tell the people
the Prophets are with me.

771
00:41:32,755 --> 00:41:34,725
That's a lot to ask.

772
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:36,819
I know that.

773
00:41:40,168 --> 00:41:42,297
I need more than just prestige,
Essa.

774
00:41:42,338 --> 00:41:43,966
I know that, too.

775
00:41:44,009 --> 00:41:47,743
The people need leadership
to return to the old values...

776
00:41:47,782 --> 00:41:50,617
yours and mine.

777
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,892
I can think
of no one more worthy

778
00:41:55,929 --> 00:41:58,024
of being the next Kai
than you, Winn.

779
00:41:58,067 --> 00:42:00,435
I shall do everything
in my power

780
00:42:00,471 --> 00:42:01,962
to see that you are.

781
00:42:04,912 --> 00:42:09,079
The Prophets are smiling
on you today, Minister.

782
00:42:21,609 --> 00:42:23,134
Dax?

783
00:42:23,179 --> 00:42:25,547
I have Admiral Chekote
on subspace.

784
00:42:25,583 --> 00:42:26,881
In my office.

785
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:29,549
Commander, two assault vessels
are headed this way

786
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,058
on direct course from Bajor.

787
00:42:31,093 --> 00:42:34,064
They've given all non-Bajorans
seven hours to evacuate.

788
00:42:38,506 --> 00:42:41,477
Admiral, are you up-to-date
on my communiqués?

789
00:42:41,512 --> 00:42:44,712
I think so, Commander.
How's it look?

790
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:47,084
Not good...
Jaro has the military

791
00:42:47,122 --> 00:42:48,818
communications have been cut off

792
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:50,760
and assault vessels
are on their way here.

793
00:42:50,795 --> 00:42:52,354
Are you preparing to withdraw?

794
00:42:52,397 --> 00:42:54,629
Admiral, we've just
obtained evidence

795
00:42:54,735 --> 00:42:56,294
that the Circle's
been receiving weapons

796
00:42:56,338 --> 00:42:57,533
from the Cardassians.

797
00:42:57,573 --> 00:43:00,066
If we withdraw,
we'll be giving Bajor...

798
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:01,807
and the wormhole... back to them.

799
00:43:01,848 --> 00:43:03,339
Damn.

800
00:43:03,384 --> 00:43:05,877
That's a hell of a turn.

801
00:43:05,922 --> 00:43:08,586
How can these Bajorans
get in bed with the Cardassians?

802
00:43:08,693 --> 00:43:11,163
They don't even know
the Cardassians are involved.

803
00:43:11,198 --> 00:43:12,598
Then you're saying that it's

804
00:43:12,634 --> 00:43:15,104
a genuine political revolution
internal to Bajor.

805
00:43:15,138 --> 00:43:17,199
Supported by the Cardassians.

806
00:43:17,242 --> 00:43:19,610
But internal to Bajor.

807
00:43:19,713 --> 00:43:22,616
The Cardassians
might involve themselves

808
00:43:22,685 --> 00:43:25,851
in other people's civil wars,
but we don't.

809
00:43:25,891 --> 00:43:28,225
The Prime Directive applies,
Ben.

810
00:43:30,266 --> 00:43:31,529
Admiral.

811
00:43:31,569 --> 00:43:35,201
Would you say that our people
on the station are in danger?

812
00:43:35,242 --> 00:43:36,369
Yes.

813
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:38,972
Then there's no other choice
but to evacuate.

814
00:43:39,015 --> 00:43:40,210
We'll have to worry

815
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:42,881
about the long-term
political implications

816
00:43:42,922 --> 00:43:43,890
down the road.

817
00:43:43,923 --> 00:43:45,721
That's an order, Commander.

818
00:43:50,636 --> 00:43:55,168
Chief, how long will it take us
to evacuate Deep Space 9?

819
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:57,476
I'd say we could have
all of our people

820
00:43:57,514 --> 00:43:59,346
out and away in... three hours.

821
00:43:59,385 --> 00:44:01,183
I mean a complete evacuation.

822
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:04,853
I intend to take all Starfleet
instruments, materiel...

823
00:44:04,894 --> 00:44:07,797
in fact, all Federation
property of any kind.

824
00:44:07,834 --> 00:44:09,530
How quickly can we do that?

825
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:13,339
Well, sir, that'll take days...
one week, for all I know...

826
00:44:13,377 --> 00:44:17,578
but those assault vessels are
going to be here in seven hours.

827
00:44:22,927 --> 00:44:25,397
Then, I guess some of us
won't quite be done

828
00:44:25,432 --> 00:44:27,025
by the time they get here.
