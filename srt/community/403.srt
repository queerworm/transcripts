to the Inspector Spacetime

Are you watching

12
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,321
Why does he have
to wake up so early?

Can't we just tell Abed
that we're sleeping
together?

14

No. No. Abed's fragile.

We have to ease him
into it, okay?

16
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:38,121
Do we want him to freak out
and then we have
to rescue him

00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,915
from some fantasy world
where submarines
are small enough

00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:43,919
I totally want
to do that.

00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:45,713

Troy, it's a week away,
and we need to revise
our whole strategy.

Mwah.

25
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:58,851
Troy, I've printed out
several maps of
the convention center

26
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:00,978
and color-coded
the best potential routes.

a longer stride,

though.

You're right.
For an Inspector

I would need a bag
to put over my head.

But Annie and I
are going skiing.

50

I agreed to this road trip.

no one was trying
to leave you out.

We just assumed
you wouldn't be interested.

00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,434
Which is why
we left you out.

00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:23,727
That's not fair.

is find the booth
where they take
the gluon photo.

76
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:02,683
It's a photo
where two people
are fused together

Because they've never seen
a man who's had sex before?

102
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,701
All right, how many of those
do you have in your chamber?

103
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,119

Okay. Now we're
definitely leaving.

But I've never been

I know.

Abed, the gluon photo line
looks really long.

119
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,030
We should probably
get in it now.

120

Definitely.
Right after I find Toby.

We've been emailing
for months.

125
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:50,749
Oh. You never
mentioned him.

126
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,417
Well, you've been
so busy lately having sex.

127
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,752
Besides, we talked
about embracing change,

128
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,462
so I'm expanding
my social circle.

129
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:57,422
I just hope he makes it.

130
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,466
He works in Nigeria
in banking.

131
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,176
He almost
couldn't come because
all his money was tied up

132
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:02,469
in this financial thing,
but I sent him 700 pounds

133
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,720
and a plane ticket,
so he should be here.

134
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:05,639
Oh, Abed.

135
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,015

Ooh, before I forget,
here is your check.

Thanking you very much
indeed.
Nice.

140
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,609
You wouldn't believe
how many people
I emailed asking for help,

141
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:18,693
and they completely
ignored me.

142

Hmm.
Toby, this is Britta.

but then his wife

What a bitch.

152
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,211
Wait, was that
the female inspector?

153
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,005
Not in front of Toby.

154
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,381
Hey, gluon line,
we should probably
get in it right now.

155
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,634
Alternatively,
someone might just happen

156
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,595

want us here?

174
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,767
Yeah, I'd like
a turkey burger

175
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,229
and a second turkey burger,
but with no bun.

176
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,981
My husband
doesn't do carbs.

177
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,483

like a scotch.

Horrible.

Brilliant.

Do they even
have to talk?

201
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,720
They could just
touch tentacles

to steal your boyfriend.

208
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,278
I'm gonna get a refill.

209
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,579
What if Abed wants
to replace me?

210
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:20,250
It makes me
so angry and sad
all at the same time.

211
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:21,793
I know, but
you have to hide it,

212
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,086
because,
for some reason,

213
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:24,921
men find these feelings
to be psycho,

214
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,674
and, if you freak out,
it's only gonna
push Abed away.

if they don't come back
to you,

217

they were never yours
to begin with.

218
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:35,807
That makes no sense.

hit by a car
or fall down a well?

He really needs
the diffuser for his hair.

279
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,021
It sounds shallow,
but he's a lawyer.

280
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,357
Actually,
having dual careers

281
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,025
has put a lot of stress
on our marriage.

282
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,527
Hence the separate rooms.

00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:55,280

is really gonna change
all that.

284
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:56,864
My husband
will finally see me

Actually I would like
to say something.

295
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:24,351
I am friends with
a couple of huge
<i>Inspector Spacetime</i> fans,

296
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,311
and I think
what they like
about the show

297
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:27,854
is that it's smart,
complicated,

298
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,231
and doesn't talk down
to its audience.

299
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:33,443
So, if you'd like to
make a really good
American version,

300
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:34,693
you should
stay true to that.

00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,909

But everyone here
thinks you're so nice.

00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,677

bring you down here.

And your American accent
isn't at all convincing.

319
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:28,540
We come all this way,
and you just
leave me alone

320
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:31,334

00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,148
(SILENTLY) What?

347
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:38,526
I can't wait.
We can visit

348
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:39,778
the original
<i>Spacetime</i> set.

349
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:41,195
And I've got
a spare bedroom,

350
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,405
so you can stay
as long as you like.

351
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:43,782
That all sounds great.

352
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:44,865
But I don't know
if I could just
pick up and leave.

353
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,285
I have a life here.
For now.

354
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,203
What do you mean?

355
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,539
Well, let's face it.
Neurotypicals don't have
the same focus you or I have.

356
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:52,957
They always
get distracted...

357
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,627
By marriage, kids,
competitive cooking shows.

358
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,295
Like your
best friend David.

359
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,421
That's right.

360
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,047
Who was planning
on coming here

361
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,090
even though
you were trapped
in Nigeria?

362
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:02,925
Yeah, but I wouldn't
say trapped.

363
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,093
And you went to me
and not to your best friend
and constable for help?

364
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:06,137
Well, his wife
probably deleted
the email.

365
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,681
She's a total...
BOTH: Minerva.

366
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,390
Right.

367
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:10,725
And you're dressed
as the third Inspector,

368
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,226
who was famous for trying
to strangle the actor

369
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,478
who played
Constable Dudley,
because they were

370
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,021
both pursuing
Linda McCartney.

371
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,147
David doesn't
actually exist, does he?

372
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,357
You're mad.

373
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,983
Nothing you've said
can prove that.

374
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,193
Except that when we met
you said his name
was Andrew.

375
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,695
Bollocks.
Yeah.

376
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:24,238
All right.
Guilty as charged.

377
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:28,493
Look, I had to be sure,
didn't I?

378
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,077
When you sent me
that first email

379
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,121
in which you figured out
that Inspector Spacetime

380
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,499
is both his own grandfather
and grandmother,

381
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,459
I knew we were soul mates.

382
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,211
You and I are special.

383
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,879
Neurotypicals won't admit it,

384
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,089
but some people
are just better
than everybody else.

385
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,217
They can't handle it,
so they always leave.

386
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,720
Just like how
the brilliant Inspector
has constant adventures,

387
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,847
while his constables
always eventually return

388
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,266
to their dull, ordinary
Earth lives.

389
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,812
But maybe there's a reason
the Inspector always chooses
a human companion.

390
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:57,564
He's an alien,
but his human friends

391
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,650
keep him grounded
and invested in the world,
like with me and Troy.

392

If I could Winger you
for a second.

393
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,611
Sure. I don't know
what that means, but...

394
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:07,114
Maybe all relationships are
made up of logical inspectors

395
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,826
and emotional constables,
and we need both

396
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:12,412
to make space and time
a better place.

397
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:14,914
Maybe you're right.

398
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:20,253

399
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,462

have told me.

Well, I just went upstairs
and saw your room.

455

Saw the two robes,
the two coffee cups,

456

one with lipstick,
one without.

457
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:05,001
And I saw actual hair
that looked a lot like mine

00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:06,377
on my side
of the sink,

459
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,004
so I have some questions.

460
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:09,839
Oh, God.
First one,

461
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:11,758
is that actually my hair,
and, if so,

462
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,384
did it fall out naturally?

463
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,011
Because if it did,
you need to
tell me right now,

to call science.

is going on?

have been play-acting

that we were married,
and then the staff

468
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,396
thought you were cheating,
and I had to save face.

469

Do I have
to worry about this?

470
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,735
No, I was just daydreaming.

471
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,821

a half a dozen times.

thrown in his face?

00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,257
<i>Do you know</i>
<i>why that is, ensign?</i>

520
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,220
<i>Because,</i>
<i>Inspector Spacetime,</i>

521
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,806
<i>our minds would be blown</i>
<i>with the space/time confusion.</i>

522
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:07,683
<i>That's right.</i>

523
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:11,020
<i>And now I must sleep</i>
<i>with the sexiest</i>
<i>woman here,</i>

524
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:13,355
<i>who is also</i>
<i>my grandmother,</i>

525
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,858
<i>or I will cease</i>
<i>to exist.</i>

526
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,777
<i>How do you know</i>
<i>I'm not your grandmother?</i>

527
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,612
<i>There's only one way</i>
<i>to find out.</i>

528
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,157
I hate you.
