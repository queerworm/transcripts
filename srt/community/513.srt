00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:04,880
PELTON:
This is Russell Borchert,

2
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:06,005
computer genius,

3
00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:08,049
anti-deodorant activist,
and millionaire.

4
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:11,386
He was rich
for having invented
the 9-track cassette,

5
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:15,307
which the 8-track industry
paid to keep quiet.

6
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:18,059
He funneled that wealth
into a computer school
called Greendale,

7
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,771
where he obsessively
pursued a new project,

8
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:24,775
a machine that can
process feelings.

9
00:00:24,817 --> 00:00:28,028
He apparently used
nothing but gold
to assemble his circuitry,

10
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:31,072
believing it to be
a better conductor
of human emotion.

11
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,993
It was a weird time.
<i>The Bionic Woman</i>
won an Emmy.

12
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,120
ANNIE: Rumors spread
about his relationship
with computers,

13
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:39,289
and one day,
he disappeared,

14
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:42,292
hence the legend
that he died of
the first computer virus.

15
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:44,670
The city bought the campus,
and life went on.

16
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:48,131
PELTON:
His body was never found,
nor was his immense wealth.

17
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,009
Some people said
he hid his money

18
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:52,594
using a portal
to another dimension.

19
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:54,221
Those people were on LSD.

20
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:57,892
Everyone else said
he had a secret vault
in his office.

21
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:59,476
Well, where's his office?

22
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:01,269
Good question.

23
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:05,106
We found this confession
written by Greendale's
first dean.

24
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:08,151
"To protect
the student health and
the school's reputation,

25
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:11,112
"I have sealed off
the computer department

26
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,407
"and removed the stairwell
to that entire section."

27
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,200
A section that remains
on this campus somewhere,

28
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:16,493
its secrets untouched,

29
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:18,286
including quite possibly
Borchert's millions.

30
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,039
If we found it,

31
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,207
we could buy it
from the city
before Subway.

32
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,376
Then I could really go nuts
with this place.

33
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:26,712
This is the kind
of adventure I usually
have to force upon us,

34
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:28,338
and here it is,
falling into our laps.

35
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,549
We're like <i> The Goonies,</i>
except our story
tracks logically

36
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,010

of holding up to objective
critical scrutiny.

You can't fight city hall.

Uh, apparently you can.
That's why it took so long.

42

Well, I'll be damned.
Would you look at that?

43
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,481
It's so clear now.

44
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,650
The entire school
is shaped like a penis.

45
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,611
No, that.

46
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,905
It says right here
that this stairway
leads to sublevel three.

47
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:54,698

the teachers' lounge is?

into something safer,

176
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,151
something that would last
six episodes

177
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:43,195
and have a lot of bickering
about tweezers and gluten,

178
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:45,197

and an equally
waspy brunette couple

179
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,032

<i>Better With My Worse Half</i>

or <i> Awfully Wedded</i>
or <i> Tying The Not,</i>

without a k,

Sorry.

The point is,
this show, Annie,

187
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,297
it isn't just their show.

188
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:05,466
This is our show,
and it's not over.

189
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,801
And the sooner
we find that treasure,

190
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,803
the faster
the Jeff-Britta pilot
falls apart.

191

00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:11,973

You're welcome.

194

What?

195
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,772
You were about to start
a kiss lean.

Fine.

find anything?
PELTON: No.

We've searched
every crevice
of this place,

200
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:30,491
and the only treasures
we've found

201
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,327
are this CB radio,

202

with white people on them,

203

205
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,545
Seems like an odd place
for a dead end, though.

206
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,838
Could be a secret door.

207
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,341
Maybe the jukebox
is the key to it.

208
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,468
Just remember,
it's okay if we fail.

209
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,553

That's right.

210

211

Right.

219
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:09,364
Because 127 in binary code
would be a palindrome.

220

is <i> Open The Door</i>

they went down inside it.
