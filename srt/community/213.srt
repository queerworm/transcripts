to the original script

343

damage control.

Damage?
The only damage

345
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,549
is me blowing the roof
off the universe.

346
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:27,051
I am not letting you
go back on that stage.

347
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,929
Well, maybe I won't be visiting
you late at night anymore

00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,972
with a generous spirit.

You sick, sick,
sad old man.

350
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,065
This is why I didn't wanna
take money from my parents.

351
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,025

pulling my strings.

is hit the reset button

down to average.

The way you got the kids
to think that they needed drugs.

that dependence was the enemy.
