00:00:02,628 --> 00:00:05,380
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
It's open!

2
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:09,635
Look at us.
Our group's first grown-up
Christmas party.

3
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:11,762
Thanks for hosting.
I hope you don't mind.

4
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:13,263
I brought a few things
just to make the place

5
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:16,099
look a little less
short-term
corporate housing.

6
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:18,435
Oh, well,
<i>mi casa es su</i>
art project.

7
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:20,145
Cool.

8
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:23,022
Figured
just a little
something there,

9
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:26,067
a little zhuzh
right there.

10
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,654
Just a few things
to add a little Annie.

11
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:29,947
Annie, do we have to
have another talk

12
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:31,365
about you wanting
to play house with me?

13
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,033
Sha.

14
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:35,911
Sha-na-not.

15
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:38,873
I'm just decorating
for a party.

16
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:41,709
Oh, I saw these curtains,
and I couldn't resist.

17
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,793
Let's just
live with them
for a night.

18
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:43,878
We can totally
return them.

19
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,921
Oh, let's totally
return them.

20
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:49,090
Jeff.
Live with them
for one night.

21
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:52,302
Actually,
these will also work
for Valentine's Day,

22
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,262
Presidents Day,
whenever people
get to see it.

23
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:58,099
Annie, what is this?

24
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:01,061
Oh.
I know we said
no gifts,

25
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:03,355
but I couldn't resist.

26
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:04,899
You realize
you've just put
your friends

27
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,233
in a very
awkward position.

28
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,485
A gift
creates obligation.

29
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:10,029
I don't see it
that way.

30
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,530
Well, I do,
and I think
the others will too.

31
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:12,740
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

32
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,408
Merry Christmas.

33
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,326
I know we said no gifts,
but I couldn't resist.

34
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:18,495
Oh, who couldn't have
seen that coming?

35
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:20,288
Oh, Annie,
I love what you did
with the place.

36
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,791
It's a work
in progress.

37
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,252
Good tidings,
fellow
Christmas celebrators.

38
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:26,628
And to all
a good wassailing.

39
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,130
I know we said no gifts,
but we couldn't resist.

40
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:32,091
There's a real problem
with resistance
in this group.

41
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,929
Hi.
Thank you all
so much

42
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,805
for inviting me
to my first Christmas.

43
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:40,851
Oh, Annie explained to me
that "no gifts"
means "bring gifts."

44
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:43,062
I'm getting it.
No means yes.

45
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:44,438
(HUMMING)

46
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:48,316
So this is Christmas.
Just this.

47
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,693
I was hoping
we could do a <i> Die Hard</i>
in a restaurant.

48
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:50,945
There's a place
called Nakatomi Sushi.

49
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:53,238
I hear
the Hans grouper
is to die for.

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,698
Come on, people,
it's all spelled out
in your e-vites.

51
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,784
I know you opened them.
Oh, I brought gifts.

52
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,953
Does Annie
live here now?

53
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:02,831
Okay.
Now that
we're all here...

54
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,499
Oh, wait.
Where's Pierce?

55
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,919
Oh, sensitivity training
with Gilbert.

56
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:09,421
Apparently
watching <i> Invictus</i>
didn't do the trick.

57
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:10,631
Oh. Okay.

58
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,800
Well, now that
we are all here,

59
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,636
I have some good news
and some bad news.

60
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,596
Great.
Black licorice?

61
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,306
I have to start
with the bad news.

62
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,516
It's about
our History paper.

63
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,852
I heard through
back channels
we got a failing grade.

64
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,687
ALL: What?
Kendra told me.

65
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,731
She does assistant work
for Professor Cornwallis.

66
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:29,858
I'll bet she does.

67
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,485
We failed?
This is terrible.

68
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,862
I need that paper
to graduate.

69
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,155
Who screwed up
their section?

70
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:36,657
Jeff, it doesn't matter.
No, it matters to me.

71
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,409
I want to know
who cost me
my early graduation.

72
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,620
I didn't do
anything wrong.
I worked really hard.

73
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:43,497
Guys, there's no need
to point fingers,

74
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,499
because I haven't told you
the good news.

75
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,167
I invited the professor
to our party tonight.

76
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,168
Annie!
What?
How is that better?

77
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,170
No, no, Annie's right.
This could work.

78
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,381
I mean,
the grade isn't
etched in stone.

79
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,050
I mean,
these British guys
like to socialize

80
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:56,259
with their students.

81
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,512
We just need to
show him a good time,

82
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,347
laugh at his jokes,
love whatever he loves,

83
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:01,932
and by
the end of the night

84
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:04,476
I bet you
we can get that grade
back up to a C.

85
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,769
Who knows?
Maybe even an A.

86
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,146
Or something realistic.

87
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:09,148
And just like that
our pleasant holiday party

88
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:10,899
turned into a tense,
high-stakes secret mission.

89
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:13,192
No costumes.
No funny voices.

90
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,070
Oh.
ABED: Okay.

91
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,989
But, for the purpose
of story symmetry,

92
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:19,198
I suggest
we wait here silently
until the professor arrives.

93
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,784
It's the only
real plot point
we need next.

94
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,290
Oh, what...
This is ridic...

Didn't want to
appear rude.

Was I expected
to bring a gift?

No.
Nor was anyone else.

Can I show you around,
starting with the bar?

Very feminine.

use "feminine"

Hurry back soon.

117
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:34,357
Hey, Abed,
got you an early
Christmas gift.

118
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,902
I know you were
bummed about not doing
<i>Die Hard</i> in a restaurant.

119
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:39,988
And your
recent divorce.

"To Abed.
Yippee-ki-yay,
Father Christmas."

121
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,909
I tried to get you
taking off shoes,

122
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,493
but I didn't know
how to wrap it.

I've never seen before.
It's Macallan Eighteen.

126
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:54,502
I like to serve it neat
if that's okay with you?

127
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,629
What, in America?

128
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,256
Don't you mix it
with cherry pop

129
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,008
or monterey
jack cheese?

130
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,385
Professor,
these are melon slices
with ham.

131
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,012
And asparagus
wrapped in salmon.

132
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,974
I see somebody's
been attempting tapas.

133
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,391
Oh, that would be me.

134
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,270
I think cuisine is like
a window into history.

135
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,604
I believe
it was the Hun...

136
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,315
Actually, you know,
I was talking to the ladies.

00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,691
BOTH: Oh.

00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,027
Well, I'll let...
I'll leave you three be,
all right?

139
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,362
Britta.

140
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:24,074
Look, the professor
seems to be responding

141
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:25,450
to things that
I don't have,

142
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,327
so you gotta get in there
and jiggle something.

143
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:30,164
He hates me.
He called me
broken Barbie all year.

144
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:31,623
Well, we're all
gonna have to work it

145
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,375
if we're gonna get
that grade changed.

146
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,461
Be honest.
Your section
sucked, right?

147
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,380
No way.
I read an entire book
on the Peloponnesian War.

148
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,800
Wow.
You pronounced it right.

149
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,552
Then someone else
had to tank it
for us to get that F.

150
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:45,762
Someone else?

151
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:49,557
Can you keep a secret?
Yeah.

152
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,144
I blew my section off.
What?

153
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:54,188
Well, there was
a secret Tom Waits show
in town,

154
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,314
so I did the math.

155
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:56,898
There's seven sections
to the paper.

156
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,234
Annie gets an A,
Pierce buys
his from Neil,

157
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:00,485
so that's solid.

158
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,112
And then you guys get
B's and C's,

159
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:03,864
so, I figured
if my section gets an F,

160
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,325
the worst
we could end up with
is a C-minus.

161
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,951
So you just left
your section blank?

162
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:09,703
No, of course not.

163
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,579
I copied and pasted
the lyrics to
<i>War, what is it good for?</i>

164
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,123
Good God.
Shh.

165
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,250
Your friends
were counting on you.

166
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,793
Well, that's
their fault.

167
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,461
I have
carefully cultivated

168
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,714
a persona that screams,
"You're on your own."

169
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,050
That's my judgey face.

170
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,592
Noted.
I'll make it right.

171
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,802
I'm going back in.

172
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,598
How's it going?

173
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,726
Well, he asked me
to get my fit bum
to the kitchen for a refill,

174
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,102
so that's good, right?

175
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,562
Kevin's showing him
a card trick.

176
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:36,771
What?

177
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,648
Oh, God.

178
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:39,774
Is this a card?

179
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,526
No, it isn't.
Queen of hearts.

180
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:42,986
No, I'm asking,
is this a card?

181
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,280
Hey, Kevin, did you know
that we have bubble wrap?

182
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:48,325
What?
Poppy poppy paper.

183
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:50,744
I so enjoy that.
Do you mind
if I pop some?

184
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:51,995
Oh, go crazy.

185
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:53,705
Changnesia.

186
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,665
I mean,
why do you
indulge that idiot?

187
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,667
Oh, I, too,
was skeptical at first,

188
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,418
but now I actually have
some sympathy.

189
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,879
I believe
it was Tacitus who said...

190
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,548
You know, Mr. Winger,
your pathetic attempts

191
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,842
to suck up to me
are a wee bit transparent.

192
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:08,136
I mean,
I can only surmise that
it's something to do

193
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,430
with the C-minus
I gave you
for that final paper.

194
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,224
C-minus?

195
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,975
Oh, thank you.
Is this the...

196
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,476
If you'll excuse us.

197
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,396
Annie, he's giving us
a C-minus.

198
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,897
Right.
A C-minus

199
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:19,856
is not a failing grade.

200
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,316
To me, it is.

201
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:22,734
I'm on
a valedictorian track,

202
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,653
and a C-minus
means I fail to get
valedictorian.

203
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,906
You ruined
our Christmas dinner

204
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,491
so you could be crowned
the smartest person
at the dumbest school?

205
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,119
Look, the only reason
I agreed

206
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,162
to kiss
that pompous Anglo's ass

207
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,997
was because I thought
we were getting an F.

208
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,540
Good news,
Mr. Winger.

209
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,459
You may remove your lips
from my buttocks,

210
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,046
because you have
in fact succeeded
in changing your grade.

211
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,006
It's now an F.
What?

212
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,633
You're F-ing us?

213
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:49,677
Professor, if you could
just give us a minute,

214
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,721
this has been
a terrible misunderstanding,

215
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:54,474
and I'm sure
we can get this
whole thing sorted out.

216
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,436
Bedroom.
Now.

217
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,148
Jeff just got us an F.

218
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,274
I thought we had an F.

219
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:03,524
No, we were lied to.

220
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,943
This isn't fun.
That guy's creepy.

221
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,403
Yeah, if there's
a human version

222
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:07,821
of Scrooge McDuck,
this guy is it.

223
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,656
This wouldn't
have happened
if Jeff hadn't taunted him.

224
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:12,200
No, it wouldn't
have happened
if you hadn't decided

225
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,493
a C-minus
isn't good enough.

226
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,078
When are you
gonna grow up
and realize

227
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,414
that grades don't matter
outside of school?

228
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:18,665
That's a lie they tell
dumb people

229
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,334
when they're fitting them
for work boots.

230
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,835
All we needed
was a passing grade,

231
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,254
and we had it
until you dragged us
into this mess.

232
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,300
Judgey face.
All right.

233
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:29,550
I will talk to him,
man to man,

234
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,345
and try to get
our C-minus back.

235
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:32,720
Ah!

236
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:33,972
Annie, it's the best
we can do right now.

237
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,182
Let me handle this.

238
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,517
CORNWALLIS: Let go of me,
you big, hairy nutter!

239
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:41,062
I'm proving my worth
to you guys.

240
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:42,356
Do you want me
to kill him?

241
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,030
Kevin, bad!

242
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,449
I have changnesia.
I'm not a dog.

243
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:54,868
Professor,
we're so sorry.

244
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,870
Obviously,
Kevin made a mistake.

245
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,372
Or did he?

246
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:00,040
Why are you
or did he-ing him?

247
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,667
I'm just saying
the professor can't get
any more tied up,

248
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,752
and we can't get
any less than an F,

249
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,172
so let's just take a beat
and think this through.

250
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:09,132
Okay, this is way better
than <i> Die Hard</i>
in a restaurant.

251
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:12,802
So what exactly
is your plan here,
Mr. Winger?

252
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:15,138
I mean, I'm certainly
not gonna change your grade,

253
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,724
and it'll take
several days to starve me

254
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:20,977
as I really loaded up
on that dreadful tapas.

255
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,271
Oh, but you already
have changed it, Professor.

256
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,981
You just dropped it
to an F,

257
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,774
thereby proving the work
on the page

258
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,902
is not the only factor
you consider.

259
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,779
And now, thanks to Kevin's
complete misreading
of the situation,

260
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,948
we have
our moment
of maximum leverage,

261
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,159
so let's just talk
about this F.

262
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:39,787
Maybe it can come up
to a C-minus,
or, who knows,

263
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,248
perhaps an A.

264
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,166
This is actually a felony.

265
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,377
I mean,
I will call the police,

266
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,337
and you will all
go to jail.

267
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,172
Let me explain to you
why you won't do that.

268
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:50,507
First, he's tied up.

269
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:52,759
First, you're tied up,
and second,

270
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,303
who can really be sure
what happened
in this apartment?

271
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:56,971
Maybe you attacked
one of us.

272
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,516
Oh, really?
Where are the signs
of struggle?

273
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,269
Oh.
You were
full of scotch

274
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,728
when things took
a dark turn.

275
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,773
We'd all heard
about your troubles
with co-eds

276
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,358
back at Oxford,

277
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,152
but it was becoming
all too real.

278
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:13,488
As you lumbered
around the room,
we had to assume

279
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,032
you were coming
after me or Britta.

280
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,033
(CLEARS THROAT)

281
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,577
Or Shirley,

282
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,370
who I didn't
mention earlier,

283
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:22,705
because she
intimidates you sexually.

284
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,082
Thank you.

285
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,625
Point being,

286
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,419
let's just take
the idea of the police

287
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,087
off the table,
shall we, Professor?

288
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,465
Fine. You think
you can hold
this group together

289
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,550
without anyone cracking?

290
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:35,051
Oh, we're solid.

291
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:38,472
Empires are always
destroyed from within.

292
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:39,889
And I can
prove it to you

293
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:43,477
from the comparative comfort
of this tacky chair.

294
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,604
I will give
an A right now

295
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,064
to the first person
that unties me.

296
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,190
The rest of you
will fail.

297
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:50,733
(ALL SHOUTING)

298
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:53,736
Stay where you are.

299
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,822
This is amazing
and possibly all
in real time.

300
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,073
Everybody, stop it.

301
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,575
No one listen to him.

302
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:01,161
The professor's job
is to make us turn
on one another.

303
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,745
We hold all the cards

304
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,539
as long as
we stay united.

305
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,082
And, Kevin,
you're one of us.

306
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,667
Thank you.
All right.

307
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,379
Who will be
the betrayer...

308
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,714
The type-A Lolita,

309
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,092
the put-upon housewife...

310
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:17,511
Is that me?

311
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:20,972
Or how about you,
the odd,
emotionless Muslim?

312
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,308
I mean, come on,
you don't deserve an F.

313
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,393
And you know that,
because of
your impairment,

314
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,562
they'll forgive you
anyway.

315
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,856
All true,
but I'm probably not
your best target.

316
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,316
If you don't mind,
I'd like to get some popcorn.

317
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,026
Typically, it takes a while
for villains to ramp up.

318
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,944
Promise not to monologue
till I get back?

319
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,613
Give it up, Professor.
You got nothing.

320
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:39,032
Oh, I've got plenty.

321
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,950
Why don't we just
let him go
and be done with this?

322
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,619
It's Christmas.
We have gifts to unwrap.

323
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:44,996
Don't you see?
We can't now
or someone will get the A.

324
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,331
No one wants to
screw the group.

325
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,832
Oh, you see that,
Professor?

326
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,376
Your offer
actually made it harder

327
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,918
for you to get untied,

328
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,711
because no one wants
to be the betrayer.

329
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:56,007
Beware the Ides of March,
Mr. Winger.

330
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,717
Everyone wants to be
the betrayer.

331
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,928
What the hell
is your game?

332
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,098
I'm trying
to teach you History.

333
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,477
Your failure
will be the same
as any self-obsessed nation.

334
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,812
You only
care about each other
when you're winning.

335
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,690
The Romans loved Rome

336
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,191
when it was raping
half the world,

337
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,860
but when Hannibal
came charging
over the Alps,

338
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,529
the Romans
turned on themselves

339
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:20,907
as quickly as you can say,
<i>e pluribus unum.</i>

340
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,117
I'm pretty sure
it's anus.

341
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,120
Usually, the cracks
are hidden
within the alliances.

342
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:27,997
So let's see.

343
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,249
In any group of seven,

344
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,627
there's bound to be
some romantic entanglements.

345
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,962
See, I've noticed
that the damaged blonde

346
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,549
is dating
the childish black one,

347
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:40,134
I wonder,
does anyone take issue
with that pairing?

348
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,928
You're fishing, Professor.
No one has anything

349
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,555
against Britta
and Troy dating.

350
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:44,931
And that's coming
from Jeff,

351
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,974
and we used to date,
so...

352
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,935
Britta,
information is ammo.

353
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,562
And what we did
was not dating.

354
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:52,731
Uh.
Ah. A little friction.

355
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,441
That usually
indicates heat.

356
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,693
Heat?
There's no heat.

357
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:57,860
If there was heat,
I'd be nervous,

358
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,362
and, if I was nervous,
I'd be rambling,

359
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:01,281
and I'm definitely
not rambling,
so there's no heat.

360
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:04,075
Ah, well, I think
we found our triangle.

361
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,869
Thank you
and welcome
to the party, Troy.

362
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,414
(WHISPERS)
He knows my name.
Guys, keep it together.

363
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,541
(MICROWAVE BEEPS)

364
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:12,959
(CHUCKLES)

365
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,217
I missed something great,
didn't I?

366
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,219
Enough.
It's time to stop
arsing about

367
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:24,554
and get serious.

368
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,889
So let's hear it
from the one person

369
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,891
who needs
that A the most

370
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,186
and can't possibly abide
by an F,

371
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:37,442
the one person on pace
to become
class valedictorian.

372
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,277
I would never turn
against the group.

373
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,945
I'm not talking
about you, Miss Edison.

374
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,614
What?
Abed?

375
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,365
Jeff?

376
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:45,533
Is it me?

377
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:46,993
Oh, my God, Britta?

378
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,745
First of all, it's me,
and, second of all,

379
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:50,163
you put Britta
ahead of me?

380
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,456
None taken.

381
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,082
Oh, my God, Shirley.

382
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:54,334
Why didn't
you ever tell me
about it?

383
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,876
I didn't think
it was a competition.

384
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,087
Oh, of course
you'd play it that way

385
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,798
so I wouldn't be
expecting...

386
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:02,216
A church-going
mother of three
to be smart, huh?

387
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:06,012
So, Miss Edison,
it's decision time, isn't it?

388
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,888
Annie,
don't listen to him.

389
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,684
You know you can't make
valedictorian with an F.

390
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:14,187
And you can eliminate
your competition
in one easy step.

391
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:17,524
What else do you have
to lose, my dear?

392
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:20,151
I mean, these people,
they're not here
to support you.

393
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:23,822
I mean,
they already hate you
for this disaster of a party.

394
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,406
Not this guy.

395
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:27,908
No.
I can't.

396
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,537
Give it up, Professor.
You've fired
all your bullets.

397
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:34,040
No, I've got
one more bullet left,

398
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,125
and it's a doozy.

399
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,837
Mr. Winger, would you like
to tell your friends

400
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,339
why they did so poorly
on this paper,

would all work hard,

an evening

Rizzoli and Isles,

is going on in here?

the Benedict Arnold,

to find out now.

what you taught us
tonight?

That, yes,

our weakness.
It's our strength.

The one thing
that we can count on

453

is that the six of us

made by one of us.

And that means,
at any given moment,

one of us
is screwing up so badly,

465
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,862

the betrayer would say.

tie a knot?

00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,689
Really simple.

482
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,106
So you go...

483
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,778
Make a little rabbit ear
like so,

484
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,531

down the well.

What?

What do you
want me to say?

489
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:07,545
What do you
want me to say?

490
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,547
That I did it
because I'm lonely?

491
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:12,008
That my daughter
isn't in town?

492
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,509
That she never
comes to see me

493
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:17,055
because she finds me
too manipulative?

494
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,724
Or you could say
you're sorry
for the whole thing.

495
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:23,061
Yes, I suppose
that would be accurate.

And that, as compensation
for the mental anguish
you caused us,

497
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,565
you'll give us an A.

Overreaching?

499
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,902
Fair enough.

500

can grade us separately.

Shirley and Annie
can get their A's.

give us an A,

That's really great.

Yeah.

Oh!
By the way,

528
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:38,011
I didn't get
anyone gifts,

529
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:39,386
so my gift to you all

530
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,597
is you get to lord it
over me for the next year.

531
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:44,642
No, stupid,
a gift doesn't
create an obligation.

532
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:47,020
It's the obligation
that's a gift.

533
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,563
I gotta
drop a deuce.

534

I was gonna save these

were getting antsy.

At nice times

549
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,609
I wonder what's happening
in the darkest timeline.

Timeline?

551

no dark timelines.
