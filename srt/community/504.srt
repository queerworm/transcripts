1
00:00:02,294 --> 00:00:04,505
Well, that was
a weird afternoon.

2
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:08,300
I guess I knew Pierce
was part of a weird,
futuristic cult,

3
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:11,804
but I wasn't prepared
for a funeral
with so much beeping.

4
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:14,055
Well, let's not judge.

5
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:17,726
Everyone has a right
to whatever fake religion
they delusionally choose.

6
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:21,355
Abed, you were by the coffin
for a long time.
Are you okay?

7
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:24,399
I'm okay.
Although...

8
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,527
<i>♪ Troy and Abed</i>
<i>are in mourning ♪</i>

9
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:27,862
Will you guys
please stop doing that?

10
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:29,655
I can't believe you did it
during your eulogy.

11
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:31,824
So uncomfortable.

12
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:34,702
I don't think the audience
got that we were singing
"mourning" with a "U."

13
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,954
You were singing
"mourning" with a "U"?

14
00:00:36,996 --> 00:00:38,455
Oh, no.

15
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:41,041
I still don't fully understand
the Laser Lotus theology.

16
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:44,294
So Pierce's body
is in the coffin,
and we buried it,

17
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:46,672
but this energon pod
contains his life...

18
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:49,090
Vapor?

19
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,134
Yeah, it's all right here
in this incredibly persuasive
literature they passed out.

20
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:54,972
Once you reach level 16,
you can see
the color blurble.

21
00:00:55,014 --> 00:00:56,473
Of all the ridiculous
cartoon nonsense.

22
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:58,809
If there is a blurble,
the Lord keeps it hidden
for a reason.

23
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:00,185
What up, n-bombs?

24
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:02,813
How was the funeral?
Awesome?

25
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:05,649
No, Chang, our friend's
funeral was not awesome.

26
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:08,318
It was deeply sad.
You know, funeral style.

27
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,821
Excuse me.
I thought you
guys hated Pierce.

28
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:12,364
(ALL PROTESTING)

29
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,866
We did not hate Pierce.
Craziness.

30
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:15,325
All right, are you sure
you guys aren't

31
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,828
just doing the
"respect the dead"
jig-a-lig?

32
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,039
I think you have us mistaken
for you, Chang.

33
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,417
I don't know.
I definitely remember you
complaining about him

34
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,126
a lot.

35
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,713
We complained about him
when he was alive.
This is different.

36
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:29,423
Can't believe we'll never
see him again.

37
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,341
Just a reminder
you gotta live
life to the fullest.

38
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:32,801
By the time
Pierce was my age,

39
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:35,637
he had already been fired
from 15 jobs.

40
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:37,973
I've only seen two
<i>Police Academies.</i>

41
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,934
The last two.

42
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:42,519
Well, he's gone too soon
but won't be soon forgotten.

43
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:44,897
I would say you're
quite correct, Mr. Winger.

44
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,065
Who the hell are you?

45
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,608
My name is Mr. Stone.

46
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,317
That's easy for you to say.

47
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:51,737
And for us to say.

48
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:53,447
I work for Mr. Hawthorne.

49
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,283
He specified in his will
that no matter
how natural in appearance

50
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,493
the circumstances
of his death,

51
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:02,289
a private inquest should be
conducted to determine
whether any one of you,

52
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,166
his former study group,
murdered him.

53
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,919
(GASPS)
What?

54
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:09,046
To be cleared,
you must all submit
to a polygraph test.

55
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:13,133
Aw, schnizzle.
You guys are in trouble!

56
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,259
Later.

57
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,928
Mr. Chang, I presume.

58
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,889
You're also listed
as a suspect
and requested to participate.

59
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:21,100
Fine, but I ask
the questions.

60
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,350
I'm afraid
I can't allow that.

61
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:25,312
All right,
then just the "fine" part.

62
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,481
(AIR HISSING)
Oh! Oh!

63
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,733
We're losing Pierce!
Everyone, quickly!

00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,986

00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:34,947

They're like the pie fight
of cop movies.

78
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,272
Or the acupuncture
of the legal system.

79
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,441
I can't believe Pierce
would think
we might murder him.

80
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:12,901
Yeah, what a waste
of murder.

81
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:14,653
I mean, he was, like, 79.

82
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:15,946
I don't suppose anyone
wants to know

83
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:17,906
I consider
this a violation.
Mmm-mmm.

84
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,407
Come on, it's just Pierce
being Pierce.

85
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,826
It's his final wish.

86
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,619
If I had a final wish,
I'd use it to stay alive.

87
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,412
Let's do it.
How do we begin?

88
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,165
We're to start
with Miss Perry.

89
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:28,249
State your name.
Britta Perry.

90
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,585
Have you ever had
any thoughts of violence
towards Pierce Hawthorne?

91
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,629
No.
Lie.

92
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:36,257
I mean, I may have wanted
to slap him now and again,
but I didn't kill him.

93
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,052
In all your sexual fantasies
about Pierce Hawthorne,

94
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:39,260
none of them involved
his murder?

95
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,721
What? No.

96
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,806
But you have had
sexual fantasies
about Mr. Hawthorne.

97
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,850
No! What kind of
question is that?

98
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,435
I'm asking the questions
just as Mr. Hawthorne
wrote them down,

99
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,896
I assure you.

100
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,689
Mr. Winger,
state your name.

101
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:51,565
Jeffrey Winger.

102
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:52,858
Are you gay?
No.

103
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,526
Are you sure you're not gay?
Yes.

104
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,028
Gay murderer says what.
What?

105
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,654
He's telling the truth.
I've been instructed

106
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,073
to point out
that that means you're gay.

107
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,448
Ms. Bennett.
Hmm?

108
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,992
State your name.
Shirley Bennett.

109
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:03,284
Are you a dishonest person?

110
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,079
No.
She thinks that's true.

111
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,747
Uh, you could have
just said no.

112
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,582
I'm watching you
acting scientific

113
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,000
and then adding
your little two cents
every now and again.

114
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,002
Huh?
Continue.

115
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:13,628
Is it true that you're
a platinum level donor

116
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,631
with the pro-life organization
prenatalpatriots.org?

117
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,425
What?
Keep it cool, girls.

118
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,719
It's my money.
It's my choice.

119
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,637
Yeah, well, if I wanted
the government in my uterus,

120
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,973
I'd fill it with oil
and Hispanic voters.

121
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,601
Keep it frosty, ladies.
Don't let your goats
get gotched.

122
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,644
Mr. Barnes, state your name.

123
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:30,979
Troy Barnes.

124
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,564
D'oh! I meant to say,
"Butts Carlton."

125
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,649
He did mean to say,
"Butts Carlton."

126
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,860
(SNICKERS)
She said it.

127
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,905
Mr. Barnes, did you get angry
when Mr. Hawthorne told you
Fat Albert died of diabetes?

128
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:41,782
Yes, like any American would.

129
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,283
Angry enough to murder him?
No.

130
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,576
Is it true that you
and Abed Nadir

131
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,453
have an elaborate
doomsday escape plan

132
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:49,873
to be used in the event
of zombie attacks?

133
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:52,084
We may have a designated
rendezvous point

134
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:56,379
and a couple of bugout bags
filled with gold coins
and condoms

135
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,133
just in case we need to
bargain our way onto a boat.

136
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:01,342
The gold coins
are for buying food.

137
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:05,264
Does your doomsday plan
account for the welfare
of any of your other friends?

138
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,015
Pass.
Answer the question.

139
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,350
No.
Troy! Rude!

140
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,645
It's a doomsday plan,
not a picnic plan.

141
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,063
Do you really wanna see
the horrors

142
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:15,190
we might have to endure
just to get on a boat?

143
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,650
I guess not.
That's a lie.

144
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,652
Ah!
He's doing it again.

145
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,028
Pierce is doing it again.

146
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,822
Mr. Chang, state your name.

147
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:25,325
Benjamin Franklin Chang,
ready to deal out the truth.

148
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:28,411
Nothing to hide.
Let's do this.

149
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,581
Have you ever masturbated
in the study room?

150
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,753
Mr. Nadir, state your name.
Abed Nadir.

151
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,630
Have you ever 9/11'd anyone?

152
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,007
Nope.
When you were a child,

153
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,967
did you ever kill a squirrel
with a slingshot

154
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,551
and were surprised
that you felt nothing

155
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,972
and wondered if
you were capable of
doing it to a human?

156
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:50,017
No.

157
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,894
(SIGHS)
Ooh.

158
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,396
Do you and Troy still actively
use Jeff's Netflix account
without his permission?

159
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,356
Wait, what?
You told Pierce that?

160
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,776
You logged in at our place
and never logged out,
so we use it.

161
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:02,361
Is that why my review
of <i> The Grey</i>
is constantly changing?

162
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,738
Yes, stop giving it
four stars.

163
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,115
I like Liam Neeson!

164
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:06,700
Then send him a message about
the roles he chooses.

165
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,660
Look, this is not the issue!
You're stealing from me!

166
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,121
And as your roommate,
you're making me
an accomplice.

167
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:12,831
I had no idea.
Lie.

168
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,582
Why would I even try that?

169
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,709
State your name please, Miss.

170
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,252
Annie Edison.

171
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,254
Miss Edison, did you use
your exceptional intelligence

172
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,798
and organizational skills
to plot the foolproof murder

173
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,050
of Pierce Hawthorne?

174
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,302
Aww!
And no.

175
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:29,056
Is it true that you
overcharged Troy and Abed
for their share of the rent?

176
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,349
(WHISPERS)
Pierce!

177
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:31,683
Annie?

178
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,852
Yes, but for a good reason.

179
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,937
You guys know you're bad
with money.

180
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,898
I padded your share
of the rent by $10

181
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,440
and I've been putting it into
a savings account

182
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,193
that yields 4%.

183
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:43,028
You'll be thanking me
in six years

184
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,905
when you find out
you have $86.

185
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,240
That's jacket money.

186
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,949
Oh, did you hear that, Abed?

187
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,035
We've been washing
paper plates and
making our own toothpaste.

188
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,410
But don't you worry.

189
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:52,746
When we have robot bodies
on the moon,

190
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,122
we can share a free jacket.

191
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,124
Annie, you should know better
than to horde money.

192
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,292
That's a stereotype.

193
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,920
Was that anti-Semitism?
No!

194
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,255
That's sensitivity.

195
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,090
It's anti-Semitic
to do things like that

196
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,716
when you know full well
you're Jewish.

197
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,343
Whoa.
We could have bought a tire

198
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:08,136
for our tire swing
with that money.

199
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,679
Or your own Netflix account?

200
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,431
Liam Neeson? Not that great.
Your rating system is flawed.

(OVERLAPPING SHOUTING)

202
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,854
All right!
(SHOUTING STOPS)

203
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,231
Let's begin.

204
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:22,734
Wait, wait.
What do you mean, "begin"?

205
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,861
That completes the calibration
round of questioning.

206
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:26,321
We're ready to begin
the formal inquest.

207
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:27,447
I think we're ready to end.

208
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,032
We've humored this
long enough.

209
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,410
Jeff, it's for Pierce.

210
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,995
Look, respect for the dead
is only a thing

211
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,623
because the dead usually
don't do any more damage.

212
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:37,874
Ah.
That's true.

213
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,876
You can quit any time
you like.

214
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:43,422
But it should be noted
that Mr. Hawthorne's estate
is worth over $20 million

215
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,839
and only those cleared
of his murder

216
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,800
can receive
their bequeathments.

217
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,094
I'm only gonna say this once.

218
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,637
Clearly, Pierce is trying
to lure us

219
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,764
into a labyrinth
of emotional manipulation

220
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,474
and strategic instigation.

221
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,310
And I think we're all
smart enough to know

222
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:57,978
we should quit
while we're not ahead.

223
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,562
I do believe we should...
Yes, definitely.

224
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,273
...quit while we're ahead.
Absolutely.

225
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,275
Right.
They're all lying.

226
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,819
We all know that,
you judgmental bitch!

227
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,786
Miss Perry, have you ever
eaten at the sandwich shop

228
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,080
started by Mrs. Bennett
and Mr. Hawthorne?

229
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,082
Yes.

230
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:20,500
And what sandwich
would you order from
Shirley's Sandwiches?

231
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,543
The only one I can,
the Helen of Soy with no mayo.

232
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:23,920
Helen of Soy.
Are you aware that in order

233
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,547
to save money,
Shirley stopped
using real tofu

234
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,925
and replaced it with
a midwestern tofu substitute

235
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,969
called "Meatfu"?

236
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,762
Oh, my God!
Oh!

237
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:35,974
It's still not
actually meat...
legally.

238
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:39,227
You have never respected
anything that I hold sacred!

239
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,104
I'm sorry!
Shirley, did you know

240
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:44,441
that Britta was high
on marijuana at
your son's baptism?

241
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:45,692
I'm sorry?

242
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,445
Well, no higher than usual.
Not true.

243
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:50,822
You did drugs in my church?

244
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,367
No, I did drugs in
the parking lot of
your church.

245
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:54,617
How else do you
expect somebody

246
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,328
to sit through something
like that?

247
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,413
At least with a bris there's
an element of suspense.

248
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,375
Well, next time, I'll have
Cheech and Chong
do the warm-up!

249
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,752
Guys, these questions
are obviously designed
to turn us against each other.

250
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,754
If we want to beat Pierce
at his game,

251
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,424
we have to own up to
our mistakes and
forgive each other.

252
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,968
Mr. Winger, is it true
that you keep trophies
of your sexual conquests?

(ALL GASP)

254
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,222
In a church, Britta?

255
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,390
For shame.

256
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,016
It's where Jesus
gets his mail.

257
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,894
Answer the question,
Adrien Grody!

258
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,937
I know what Pierce
is referring to.

259
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:26,149
I have a box of
forgotten items in
my apartment.

260
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:29,027
I happen to be a single male.
Visitors leave things.

261
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,530
Is one of your trophies
a pair of
Miss Perry's panties?

262
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,991
(GASPS)
You told me
a hawk stole them!

263
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,452
You exploited me
and made me believe

264
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,329
in a slightly
more magical world.

265
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:41,456
If you want to collect
women's underwear,
can't you just buy them?

266
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:42,332
They have to be
won in battle.

267
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:44,042
Oh!
Blegh! Gross!

268
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,460
Jeffrey!
Awesome.

269
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:48,213
I think we can all agree
that the gross thing here

270
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,923
is that Pierce is snooping
through my stuff.

271
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,925
Not really, Abed and I
go through
your stuff all the time.

272
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,052
Why do you keep bread
in the freezer?

273
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,096
And why does your bathroom
mirror say, "You're special,"
when you fog it up?

274
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,222
Look, I don't have
to answer these...

275
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:58,932
You took a shower?
Yeah.

276
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,350
Mr. Barnes.
Okay! I did it!

277
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:01,935
Okay?
I killed Pierce!

278
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,686
Lie.
Okay, good.

279
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:04,812
Just making sure.

280
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,731
You and Abed Nadir
have a specialized,

281
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,233
exclusive handshake
that you refuse to do

282
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:09,192
with your other friends?

283
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,319
Absolutely.

284
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:12,820
Mr. Barnes, did you invent
that handshake?

285
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,030
Yes.

286
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,449
Lie.

are you a subscriber

00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,454
No.

296

Can't look at you right now.

297
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,928
Then you should know
I'm crying.

298
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,555
I forgive you,
but only to escape
the established pattern

299
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:39,764
of self-righteous
indignation

300
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,349
followed by immediate
comeuppance.

301
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,767
Mr. Nadir.

302
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:43,935
Okay, I guess it's
happening anyway.

303
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,270
You broke my heart.
Continue.

304
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,147
Is it true that you planted
geo-trafficking devices

305
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,648
on everyone in the group
so that you would know

306
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,567
where they are at all times?
Yes.

307
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,530
Okay, you guys are changing
your faces.
Are you mad at me or hungry?

308
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,240
You're tracking us?

309
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:58,783
We're mad at you, Abed.

310
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,994
Why?
Because we already live

311
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,079
in a totalitarian
surveillance state.

312
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,332
Do you not read
my status updates?

313
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,583
But I'm not the government.
I'm your friend.

314
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,502
That's what governments
say, nimrod.

315
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,629
It's cool.
When one of you
gets kidnapped,

316
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,255
you'll be glad
you don't have to count

317
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:13,672
the bumps on the highway
from the trunk of the car.

318
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:16,050
Are those blinking dots us?
Mmm-hmm.

319
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,844
Well, what's this one
all the way to the side?

320
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:21,097
That's where Pierce is buried.

321
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:24,518
Is that why you were spending
so much time by the coffin?

322
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,061
I was trying to get it back.
They're expensive.
And he's not moving anymore.

323
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,147
Abed, where did you plant
these things?

324
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,982
If you makes you feel
any better, you'll
never find them.

325
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:34,027
I know you know it's wrong
to do that without telling us.

326
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,321
Shame on you!
Okay, I'm ashamed.

327
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,822
BOTH: Lie.

328
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,866
Miss Edison, is it true
you once secretly dosed

329
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,075
the members of
your study group

330
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,994
with a pharmaceutical
amphetamine?

331
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,497
Uh-hmm.

332
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,792
Oh, uh, yes, kind of.
What?

333
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,462
It sounds worse on paper
than it was.

334
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,297
We were cramming
for the Anthro final.

335
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,840
Everyone was falling asleep.

336
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,051
I put five milligrams
of something-something

337
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,470
in your coffees
and we all got an "A."
Done!

338
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:02,013
I'm a bad person
for tracking your location,

339
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,722
but you altered
my brain chemistry?

340
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,475
I was up for three days
that week.

341
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:06,643
I invented an entire language,

342
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:07,810
you <i> fliztbarping gitzgorg.</i>

343
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,646
I'm sorry.
You messed with my brain.

344
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:11,314
That's a big deal.
This is a big deal.

345
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,482
I don't mess
with your brain, Annie.

346
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:14,275
You kind of do.
I don't think I do.

347
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:15,443
What about
her Facebook boyfriend?

348
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:16,695
What?
That's different.

349
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:18,238
You made a profile
for a fake dude

350
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,114
and lured her
into an online relationship.

351
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,200
He's catfishing you.

352
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:25,620
You're Olympic pole-vaulting
hopeful Brent Underjaw?

353
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,080
I noticed whenever you were
in a relationship,

354
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,998
you hummed a lot and made
pancakes in the morning.

355
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,376
It wasn't about hurting you.
I did what I did in the name
of breakfast.

356
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:34,212
I bore my soul to you!

357
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,716
I told you about my holding
hands at Disneyland fantasy.

358
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:40,552
Do you care about people
at all, Abed?

359
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:43,430
Answer on the polygraph!

360
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:44,763
Jeff made me apply
for handicapped parking

361
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,641
so he can get a better spot.

362
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,142
Britta's the one
that invited Garrett

363
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,436
to Annie's birthday party!

364
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,563
Troy won't sit
on a toilet seat after Jeff!

365
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:52,980
When we're alone,
Shirley refers to you guys

366
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,148
as "those people."

367
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,774
Oh! When Annie's
with other females, dude,

368
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,277
she calls Jeff her uncle!

369
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,861
Shirley thinks
we're all going to hell!

370
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,905
You are all going to hell!
Oh, what?

371
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:04,367
(OVERLAPPING SHOUTING)

372
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:05,910
Guys, stop!

373
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:08,538
We have to stop letting
Pierce do this to us!

374
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:13,334
Mr. Hawthorne hasn't asked
a question in quite
some time, Mr. Winger.

375
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,253
He's right.

376
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:18,047
I actually forgot for a second
that Pierce was dead.

377
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,133
Maybe that's what he wanted.

378
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,510
Or maybe he wanted us
to know we're no better off
without him.

379
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,471
Or no better than him.

380
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,347
Hmm.

381
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,891
He kind of nailed it,
didn't he?

382
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,519
I didn't just masturbate
in the study room.

383
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:34,773
I masturbated everywhere.

384
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,816
Everywhere!

385
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,738
Huh.

386
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,491
Confession is good
for the soul.

387
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,867
You should try it sometime.

388
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,959
There's another round
of questions,
if you'd like to continue.

389
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,835
You want to give us a moment
to sit in our own filth

390
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,755
before you heap
another bucket on us?

391
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:00,674
It's strange
after all these years

392
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,383
how much we've kept hidden
from each other.

393
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:05,553
You'd think by now
we would have learned
to be better people.

394
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,180
I think we got into this mess
by thinking

395
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,433
there was such a thing
as better people.

396
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,893
Wait.
That's it.

397
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,062
If we're no better
than Pierce,

398
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,940
and Pierce is no worse
than us, then that means

399
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,359
nobody's really that bad.

400
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,402
So what if we're willing
to suffer

401
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:25,198
and inflict pain at the mere
prospect of material reward?

402
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,367
If we stop now,
that doesn't make us better.

403
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:30,745
It just makes us so dishonest
that we would rather be poor

404
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,580
than admit we're flawed.

405
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:36,459
Pierce admitted he was flawed,
and he died rich.

406
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:40,505
Let's celebrate his life
and death in the honest way,

407
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,757
not by saying fake nice things
around a casket,

408
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,051
but by admitting
we're monsters

409
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:48,971
and clawing joyfully
for some of his cash.

410
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:53,017
So does anybody
have anything left
before we continue?

411
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:56,855
Let's empty our tanks of
lies once and for all.

412
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,148
I'm Jeff Winger,
and if I had my choice,

413
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,108
I would rather look
at myself naked

414
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,027
than the women I sleep with.

415
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:06,113
I'm the one who hit
Jeff's Lexus
in the parking lot.

416
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,199
It wasn't a taco truck,
and it was racist of me

417
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,577
to improvise
such an ethnically
specific vehicle.

418
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,454
I only give money
to homeless people
when I'm walking with someone.

419
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,373
I've never been
to LEGOLAND.

420
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,500
I just wanted you guys
to think I was cool.

421
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:20,587
I can be passive-aggressive
sometimes.

422
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,422
Don't everybody disagree
at once.

423
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,757
Oh, Lord, I did it again.

424
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,466
When any of you chew gum,
I want to punch you.

425
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:26,885
You may as well
have submachine guns
in your mouths.

426
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,344
It vibrates my skull.

427
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:31,806
Everybody clear?
All right.
(ALL AGREEING)

428
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:34,475
Mr. Stone, hit us
with your grand finale.

429
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:37,186
May it be as brutal
as we deserve.

430
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:38,438
Very well.

431
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,107
Mr. Hawthorne's final round
of questions.

432
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:43,401
Britta Perry.

433
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,820
"Do you know that you hate
yourself more than you should

434
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:48,865
"and that your passion
inspired me?"

435
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:50,199
No.

436
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,910
That's true.
She didn't know.

437
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,913
"To Miss Perry,
I leave my iPod Nano

438
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,957
"filled with music
to take life
less seriously by."

439
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:00,126
Oh, that's nice.

440
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,253
"I also leave you
this liquid nitrogen
cooled cylinder

441
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,838
"of my hyper-virile sperm

442
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,090
"in case your lesbian
lifestyle one day wears out

00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:09,093
"and you wish to raise
an army of geniuses."

444
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,804
Shirley.
Hmm?

445
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,263
"Did you know that you
are not only a credit

446
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,474
"to your race and gender,
but to our species,

447
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,726
"and that I was intimidated
by your strength of character

448
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,812
"and business acumen?"
Yes.

449
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,271
"To Shirley Bennett

of my sperm."

Oh.

00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,118
"Did you know that you were
always my favorite?"

458
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,829
You mentioned it once,
but...

459
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,039
"I leave you this tiara, which
you once refused to accept.

460
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,333
"It's the same tiara
I used to wear

"when my mother
would verbally assault me

No.

00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,148
Yep.
Here's your sperm.

that you possess

"not to waste it like I did?"

476
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:17,077
I think.

477
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,165
"To Troy,
I leave the obligatory sperm."

478
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,877
Maybe it's because
everyone else got one,

479
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:26,420
and because
it's an old man's semen,

480
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:30,299
but, um,
I'm kind of disappointed.

481
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:32,426
"In addition, I am prepared
to leave Troy Barnes

Okay, I'm a lawyer, Troy.

498
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,882
It should be possible

499
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:13,467
to contest these conditions
as unreasonable...

500
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,177
I'll do it.
And Pierce can take

501
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,345
his mind games
and his sperm
and he can put...

Pierce was
a crazy old coot, yeah,

506
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:26,188
but I think he knew
something about me

507
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,900
that even I didn't know
until now.

508
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,234
Because he's offering me
something

509
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:33,738
I've been searching for
my whole life.

00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:38,785
Millions of dollars.

511
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,704
And being a man
or whatever he said.

512
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:44,123
Jeff, say something.

513
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,044
I'm speechless.

514
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,881
Somebody say something!

515
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:53,132
Abed?

516
00:18:56,594 --> 00:19:00,347
Cool.
Cool, cool, cool.

517
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,016
That's a lie.

518
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,236
And then that sperm
came down!

519
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,739
I mean,
I couldn't say anything!

520
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:19,909
But oh, my God!
I was gonna explode!

521
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:22,912
And then that one,
that last question,

522
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:25,665
with all of that nice stuff
out on the table,

523
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,000
and you guys were
having this discussion

524
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,584
about whether or not to quit?

525
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:31,211
At first, I was like,
"Aaaaah!"

526
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,421
But you did it!

527
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:35,549
You did it!
It was amazing!

528
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,136
You're amazing, man!
You're amazing!

529
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,554
Guys, this is the best.

530
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,807
We should do this every week.

531
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:44,934
Oh, I'm a fun guy, you know?

532
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:47,061
I mean, you talk about lying.

533
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,312
I was lying the whole time.

534
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,481
This is who I really am.
This is me.

535
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,942
This is the real me.
I'm artistic.

536
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:56,737
Ideas come to me all the time.

537
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,656
I have this idea for a movie.

538
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:01,534
It's about this guy
who oversees polygraph tests,

539
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:04,411
and the biggest obstacle
is how good-looking he is.

540
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,747
People can't focus
and tell the truth.

541
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,124
It's unbelievable.

542
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,043
By the way, uh,

543
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:12,503
we never found out
how Pierce died.

544
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:15,673
Oh, my God.
I can't believe
I didn't tell you yet.

545
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:20,219
It was dehydration
from filling up
all of those cylinders.

546
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,389
I mean, it's how I want to go,
but, hey, I'm a little nutty.

547
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,265
Mmm!

548
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,768
Are you guys thinking
what I'm thinking?

549
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,436
Shots!
