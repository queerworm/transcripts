00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:03,504
Save Greendale Committee,
please welcome

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:06,715
our newest member,
math teacher Ben Chang.

3
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:13,180
Okay,
let's get serious.

4
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:15,140
I've compiled
a short list

5
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,392
of the most immediate
Greendale emergencies.

6
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,311
Is deforestation
on the list?

7
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:22,230
I, for one, am glad
that this is happening.

8
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,650
What this school needs
is a band of heroes,

9
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:26,610
champions willing
to rise up

10
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:30,030
and "get all
those potatoes
out of the gym."

11
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:31,406
We're like House Vogadash

12
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,784
in the HBO original series
<i>Bloodlines of Conquest.</i>

13
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:35,661
BRITTA: Oh, yeah!
<i>Bloodlines of Conquest.</i>
That's my show right there.

14
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:37,037
That is a good show.

15
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:39,456
They really get
the incest right.

16
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,002
What the hell
is <i> Bloodlines of Conquest?</i>

17
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,628
It's a medieval
fantasy series.

18
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,421
It's based
on these great books
that nobody seems to read.

19
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:49,008
It's great.
It's got betrayal, boobs,
espionage, dragons.

20
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:51,176
Oh, wait, dragons?
Is that a spoiler?

21
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,803
I just started Season One.

22
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:55,347
I don't start watching shows
until they're so popular

23
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,391
that watching them
is no longer a statement.

24
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,559
So because you're
three seasons behind,

25
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,727
we have to live
in a fantasy world

26
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,520
where there's
no such thing as dragons?

27
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,022
Do we also have to pretend
that Lord Stevarios
is still alive?

28
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,064
Oops.
(ALL GASP)

29
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,607
Oh!
BRITTA: Thanks, Abed.

30
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,526
How about I buy all the
<i>Bloodlines of Conquest</i> books,

31
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:10,195
read ahead, and spoil
the whole series for you?

32
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:12,072
That's insane.
That's something
an insane person would do.

33
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:13,615
ANNIE:
Knuckleheads, focus.

34
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:15,200
Item one,

35
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,494
the Greendale student census
is out of date.

36
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:20,080
Britta, Abed, why don't you
partner up on that one?

37
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,957
Give you a chance
to squash this beef.

38
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,918
Next, the midterm dance
is tonight.

39
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,168
Who wants to be
on the decorating committee?

40
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,420
Mmm.
(CLEARS THROAT)

41
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,047
Fine, I'll do it.
I'll do it.

42
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:31,508
I will be on
that committee.
Me too.

43
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,844
Are you guys volunteering
because you think
I'll do all the work?

44
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:35,054
I wouldn't.
No. Not at all.

45
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:37,222
I don't care enough
to lie, so no.

46
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:41,685
I will reward that honesty
by giving you something easy.

47
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:44,897
A bulletin board fell down
in the cafeteria
a couple months ago.

48
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:45,981
Think you can get it
hung back up?

49
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:48,108
I'll give it a drive-by.
Great.

50
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,819

our first task,

What can I do for you?

67
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,480
Can you get me a drill,
a couple of screws,
and a bulletin board?

68
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,565
No, I cannot.
Okay, I tried. Bye.

69
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:11,942
You wanna hang
a bulletin board,

70
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:13,318
you need to get a work order
from the head janitor.

71

They get more powerful
than you?

72
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,572
Hello, I'm taking
the school census.

73
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,158
Please fill out this form,
but don't talk to me.
I can't hear.

74
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:23,662
Are you deaf?
But you read lips?

00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,540
Barbagarbagarba

76
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,083
That was gibberish.
You're good.

77
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:32,129
I wish I knew
sign language.

78
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,093
Are you going to have
another intense burst
of compatibility

we never see again?

80
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,221
I can't hear you.

81
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:47,352
The midterm dance
will need a visual theme,

82
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:50,689
like "let's blow off steam,"
and it's trains.

83
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:51,732
I have an idea.

84
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,233
Chang, your last idea
was to murder.

85
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,443

The bulletin board's a no-go.

86
00:03:55,485 --> 00:04:00,157
Really?
So you did your best,
and this task just...

87
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,367
Eludes you?

88
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,578
I have a lifetime
of experience
with red tape.

89
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:05,787
I know when to walk away.

90
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,789
Yeah, you do.
Hey, Edison.

91
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,499
The system is lazy.

92
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,835
I have integrity,
too much to deal
with any of it.

93
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:13,170
I'll do it myself.

94
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:14,796
And I would love
to watch you try.

but she's getting there.

that bulletin board hung up?

105
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,787

109
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:57,047
Any way we could
bump that up a little,

110
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:58,632
so it's somewhere above...

111
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,467
"Lower flag
for Reagan's death?"

112
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,928
You gotta talk to
a custodian for that,
we're janitors.

113
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,596
There's a difference?

114

to like you.

that you will be crying uncle

ever goes up.

to move a work order
for a bulletin board

from the bottom of the queue
to the top.

160

Now how can I do that
when I'm dealing with this?

<i>their porn unblocked.</i>

you were a cop?

00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,582
So what, is it worth it?

172
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,418
Is that what
a bulletin board is
to you, Professor?

173
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,044
A piece of cork?

174
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,963
That's not what it is
to people that
lose their pets,

175
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,381
people that need rides,

176
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:47,550
people whose bad bands
need bad bass players.

177
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:50,637
To them, every pushpin
has the power
to change the future.

178
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,473
So yes, Professor,
it's worth it.

179
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,768
I know a lady
in the I.T. department.

180
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,376
Okay, I'll put some food
on the tables,

181
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,586
we'll lower the lights,
and that's a midterm dance.

182
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:29,050
I guess it could use
a little something
theme-wise.

183
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,551
I have an idea.

184
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,267
"Bear down for midterms."

185
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,811
What?

186
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,314
"Bear down for midterms."

187
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:45,525
You can't just repeat it.
You need to
explain yourself.

188
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:47,861
It's midterm time.

189
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:51,114
Mmm-hmm.
People have to bear down,

190
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,615
study hard,
get to work.

191
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:55,869
It's "bear down
for midterms."

192
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,245
Is there a dot
I'm not connecting?

193
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,997
Uh-uh.
It's a play on words.

194
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,415
"Bear down"
is an expression.

195
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:02,250
I know the expression,
Chang.

196
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,544
"Fly on the wall"
is an expression,

197
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:08,131
but if I want to pitch
"fly on the wall
for midterms,"

198
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,550
you might ask,
"what do you mean?"

199
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,843
(SOBBING)

200
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:16,973
Chang?
Are you crying?

201
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,933
I understand
I've been crazy in the past,

202
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,936
but that doesn't make it
any less frustrating

203
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,897
to be completely dismissed
like this.

204
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,316
I don't know if you guys
even see me as human anymore.

205
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,485
I don't know if
it's like a joke to you.

206
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:29,777
Are all Asian men
like a joke?

207
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,029
If it's like
a racial thing.
No.

208
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,280
No! No!

209
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,824
I've paid for my crimes.

210
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:38,995
Underneath all the craziness,
I am still a human, and I...

211
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:43,124
I do want to make
a difference and...

212
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,544
Can you respect that?
Please?

213
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,588
Chang...

214
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,216
What can we do here?

215
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:52,842
Bear down for midterms.

216
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,219
Okay.
Okay, well...

217
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,430
We'll...
Put up some bear things?

218
00:09:56,471 --> 00:10:00,141
We'll bear down.
For midterms.

219
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,935
Okay.

220
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,729
You want me to lift
web restrictions
solely for custodial?

221
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:08,024
They need to
have full access,
so they can research, um...

222
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,359
Custodian stuff.

223
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,778
If the filter
is mistakenly
blocking a site,

224
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,947
they just need to submit
the URL, and I can...

225
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,324
Okay,
what do you want?
Excuse me?

226
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,742
Tell us what
we can do for you

227
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,453
so that you can
do this for us.

228
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:20,870
Oh. Cool.

229
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,581
I... I didn't know
it could work that way.

230
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,583
I guess I could use
decent parking.

231
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,667
Right now
they make me park
in Annex B.

232
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,044
Like a... (SIGHS)

233
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,130
Lunch lady.

234
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,173
Our committee
can talk to Parking.

235
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:33,633
But, Debra,
let's be clear.

236
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:34,968
I want everything
to get through
that porn blocker.

237
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,094
What do you mean
everything?

238
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,180
Everything!

239
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:40,599
Understood.

240
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,728
(LAUGHING)
I'm very happy right now.

241
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,189
So just bears
everywhere?
CHANG: Yep.

242
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:52,193
And then we'll have
some cakes, party hats,

243
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,154
birthday stuff!
(CHUCKLES)

244
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,738
This is coming together
better than I thought.

245
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,782
I'm sorry,
birthday stuff?

246
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,076
Yes, Duncan.
Okay, I'm sorry.

247
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,203
Birthday stuff.

248
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:06,166
Well, I've been sad to see
that bulletin board down
in the cafeteria for so long.

249
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,959
I've always had a passion
for bulletins.

250
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,336
If parking
for the IT guy

251
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:12,172
puts that board back
where it belongs,

252
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,174
I won't stand in the way.

253
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,176
You know what you need,
speaking as a fan
of bulletins...

254
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,553
You need to have the Dean
appoint someone
to oversee them,

255
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,764
to make sure bulletins
stay organized
and protected.

256
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,224
I'll do it.
We could look into that.

257
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,352
Well, not to be that guy,
but, uh...

258
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,316
You think
you could look into that
before I do this for you?

259
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:34,068
You want to control
all the bulletin boards
in the school. Why?

260
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,613
You might want to start
talking turkey, Waldron,

261
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:38,198
because the Macy's Parade
is almost over,

262
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,200
and Grandma's
getting drunk.

263
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,160
Do you know
where my department's power
comes from, Miss Edison?

264
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,287
Parking spaces.
Wrong.

265
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,873
There was plenty of space
to park in dinosaur times,

266
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,792
but not one single
parking department.

267
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,045
My power comes
from a scarcity of parking,

268
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,755
just like your dad's comes
from a lack of hugs.

269
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,341
And you know what takes
my power away?

270
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:57,800
Carpools.

271
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,554
Carpools organized
through ride shares.

272
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,681
Ride shares posted
on bulletin boards,
you son of a...

273
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:04,641
You can take the books
off your head

274
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:06,560
because
we're done posturing.

275
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,895
You want me to talk turkey,
well, gobble gobble.

276
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,813
I want ride shares gone.

277
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,483
Let's get out of here.
All right.

278
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:14,901
What?
I'll talk to the Dean.

279
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,459
I must say,
I don't know what we did,

280
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:32,960
but we sure
did the hell out of it.

281
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,672
I guess the key
to dance decoration
is just pick an idea.

282
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:38,258
And then bear down.
Right, buddy?

283
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,217
Here are your sodas.

284
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,135
Oh, my God.

285
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,930
Yeah, pretty great.
Yeah. Bear down, baby.

286
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,933
Too soon, you guys.
This is way too soon.

287
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,269
Too soon for wha...
Too soon for this!

288
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,811
After this morning
in Wisconsin?

289
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,732
Bear breaks loose
at a kid's birthday party,

290
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,692
mauls a whole bunch
of people?

291
00:12:55,734 --> 00:13:00,530
Why am I explaining this
when this is obviously
a ghoulish reference to it?

292
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:02,657
The news has been
covering it all morning!

293
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,747
That's where
I got the idea.

294
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:11,249
You know how sometimes
you hear something
and forget you heard it,

295
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,500
but you think
you came up with...

296
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,586
Oh, man.
This is bad.

297
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:17,505
(SNAPS FINGERS)
We're in crisis mode now.

298
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:20,841
We really messed up,
you guys.

299
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,470
An office
of bulletin board oversight.

300
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,472
Ah, what a novel idea.

301
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,014
I'm gonna fill out
this form right away.

302
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,016
But first, a toast.

303
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,935
To hanging
a bulletin board.

304
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:34,355
Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.

305
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,815
Uh, first time toasting?
Get in here, buddy.

306
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,193
Easy peasy,
lemon squeezy.

307
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,362
I'm not saying that.

308
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:44,783
Ah, well,
I hate to be that guy,

309
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,660
but I'm not
signing this form

310
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:50,664
until professor Hickey says
"Easy peasy, lemon squeezy."

311
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,749
Damn it, Annie.
Don't do this.

312
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,543
Whatever you've got
in your butt,

313
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,044
can we get it out later?

314
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,380
When, after he signs it?
After it's all too late?

315
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:02,008
Annie?
You petty old man.

316
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,468
When we started this,

317
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,844
I thought you'd get a taste
of the system and spit it out,

318
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,055
not open a bottling plant.

319
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,766
You're just like
all the people that...

320
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:12,143
What?
The people that
put you here?

321
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,563
The people
in the big machine
that made you fail?

322
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,273
You went from being a cop

323
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:19,942
to teaching Criminology
because of the system,
right?

324
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,402
Unfortunately for Greendale,

325
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,697
you have to prove it
by getting nothing done.

326
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,490
Well, here's a bulletin
for you...

327
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:29,410
"Annie Edison
doesn't get nothing done."

328
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,663
Yow.
And where should I put
that bulletin, Edison,

329
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:35,041
on a sham piece of cork
controlled by a parking guy

330
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,960
that lights his cigars
on student ride shares?

331
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,506
(GASPS) My God, Annie.

332
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,424
What kind of labyrinth
have you created?

333
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:44,801
Certainly not
the magic kind

334
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:46,594
with puppets
and macho rock stars.

335
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,262
You whored
yourself out, kid.

336
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,972
You wanted
that board so bad

337
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,183
that you made every board
on campus worthless,

338
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:55,687
and in doing so
made the school
just a shade dirtier.

339
00:14:57,856 --> 00:14:59,607
I thought better of you,
young lady.

340
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:03,695
Oh, man.
This got Sorkin-y.

341
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:06,406
Yeah, well,
I didn't think anything
in particular of you,

342
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,990
and now I see why!

343
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,828
Okay, I didn't follow
most of that,

344
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,455
but it feels like
I ought to do this.

345
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:15,915
Hmm?

346
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:24,924
Oh, hey, Annie.

347
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,802
Um...
What do you think?

348
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,596
"Fat dog for midterms"?

349
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,723
Yeah!
Pretty cool.

350
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:33,015
I don't understand.

351
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,726
It's an expression.
"Fat dog for midterm."

352
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,895
Like, don't sweat it,
fat dog it.

353
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,814
Hang out, relax,
like a fat dog. Bah!

354
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:40,981
You can look it up
on Wikipedia.

355
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,400
There's an entry
in there.
Yep.

356
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,903
I never... Okay.

357
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,114
I just...
I feel like I'm missing...

358
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,032
You know, Annie, um...

359
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:53,661
Sometimes it feels like
you don't take us seriously.

360
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,705
Aw.
Yeah, I guess
we bring it on ourselves,

361
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:56,831
but it's still
pretty frustrating.

362
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:58,666
Annie,
is this a race thing?

363
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,836
Race!
No! God, no!

364
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,589
You guys! I accept
that it's an expression,

365
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,758
but I don't see
the connection to...

366
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,218
You're overthinking,
Annie. It's decorating.

367
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,179
Just pick an idea
and bear down on it.

368
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,849
Um, really poor choice
of words, Ben... Too soon.

369
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,142
But you guys are right.

370
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,603
I'm sorry.
I've had a really hard day.

371
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,772

You never called.
