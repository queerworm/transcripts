00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:06,715
Good meeting.

4
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:08,008
Oh, Jeff,
what time's dinner?

5
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,136
Uh, dinner?

6
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:12,972
Jeff, you didn't
invite Shirley?

7
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:14,598
Well, it's Tuesday.

8
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,058
Shirley always goes
to Elijah's karate practice
on Tuesdays.

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,393
It's okay.

10
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,437
Part of making sacrifices
for my loved ones

11
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:23,691
is not expecting
my loved ones
to make sacrifices.

12
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,067
BOTH: Aw.

13
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,945

14
00:00:27,987 --> 00:00:29,029

and Mondays...

(SHOUTS)
We're not moving it!

16
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:35,118
When Shirley
can have dinner,
we'll have another dinner,

17
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,204
because it's just dinner.

18
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:39,247
And there's no need
to manipulate each other.

19
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,082

that's what you do.

00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:46,630

Hello,

25
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:55,138
This is David and Bixel.

26
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,765
They're app designers.

27
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,392
They'd like to beta test

28
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,978
their latest
social-networking app
on our campus,

29
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,771
which could be
good for us.

30
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:04,565
Look what Facebook

31
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:07,442
Hey, guys.
Bixel and I would
like to introduce you

32
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,820
to a little app called
meowmeowbeenz.

33
00:01:09,862 --> 00:01:10,946
Ooh.

34
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,406
Meowmeowbeenz lets you say

35
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:13,490
how much you like,

36
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:14,616

38
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,787
all from a standard
non-boost mobile phone.

00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:23,959
Bixel, what did you
think of the way
the dean introduced us?

41
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,335

I thought he did great.

42
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,838
That's why I'm giving him
five meowmeowbeenz.

Well, Bixel, I'm sorry,

45
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:33,468
but I thought his intro
was just okay.

46
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:36,931
That's why
I'm gonna give him

47
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:40,059

00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:49,693

Garrett's got
three meowmeowbeenz.
Star- Burns is a two.

Are you telling me
people are actually
using this stupid app?

It's addictively effective.
No, it's effectively stupid.

75
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:00,555
There already was
a rating system
in place called

76
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,891
"cool people get more,"
and it was working fine.

77
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:05,102
Meowmeowbeenz takes
everything subjective
and unspoken

78
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:06,478
about human interaction
and reduces it

What happened to you?

84
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,657
I sat on a toilet so long,
my feet fell asleep,

85
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,618
then I noticed limping
was getting meowmeowbeenz,

86
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,871
so I just kind of
started committing.

87
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,498

Mmm-hmm.

Wait. Are you using

If you can't kill it,

Please tell me
you're not using this app.

101
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,998
Uh, I liked
the idea at first,

giving a voice
to the unheard,

103
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,168
but then Annie
just told me

104
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,837
that the rating system
is exponentially weighted.

105
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,296
As your ratings go up,

106
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,298
your ratings
of other people
become more important.

107
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,383
No.

108
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,260
It just means
the more others like you,

109
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,887
the more likeable
you can make others.
It makes sense to me.

110
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,513
You know who else
it made sense to?
