1
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:08,550
We are so screwed.
How are we gonna
memorize all this?

2
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:09,927
Let's just
go over it again.

3
00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:11,846
Kingdom, phylum, class...

4
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:14,014
Order, family,
genus, species.

5
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,476
I use a mnemonic device.

6
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:19,353
"Kevin, please come
over for gay sex."

7
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:23,774
Why wouldn't
you use "Karen"?

8
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:25,526
'Cause it's gay sex, dummy.

9
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:26,819
So use "great".

10
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:28,737
Now I can't remember
anything. Thanks!

11
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,531
God, why do we always
end up in this position?

12
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,032
For all the time
you spend here,

13
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:33,742
you'd think we wouldn't
have to cram so much.

14
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:35,035
Maybe we never
get any work done
because we have

15
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:36,119
so much fun hanging out
together.

16
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,455
Definitely,
maybe that's why.

17
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:45,253
Ah, the duali-Dean of man.
(GIGGLES)

18
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:48,590
I'm dressed this way
because I have good news
and bad news.

19
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:50,342
You have got to
be kidding me.

20
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:53,470
The bad news is
Professor Kane
has the flu.

21
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:56,264
The good news is
biology class is canceled.

22
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,432
(ALL CHEER)

23
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,559
After you.

24
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,478
What a gentleman.

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,272
Guys,
we don't have to cram
last minute anymore.

26
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,274
Last minute got
moved to tomorrow.

27
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,193
Three-hour lunch?
Three-hour lunch?
Three-hour lunch?

28
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:09,444
Three hours?

29
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,572
I could watch
the first half
of three movies.

30
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,532
Ooh, I don't have to go
to the fast food restaurant
across the street.

31
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,116
I can go to the fancy one
across town.

32
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,368
Their manager
wears a tie.

33
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,328
If we don't eat,
we can make-believe

34
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,955
an whole episode's worth
of Inspector Spacetime
in the Dreamatorium.

35
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:21,248
Word.
Yeah.

36
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,585
Maybe we should go
to Senor Kevin's.

37
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,712
Britta, didn't you want
to try that new
cage-free bean burrito?

38
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:29,130
The tortillas are made with
micro-financed flour.

39
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,340
Troy, you could drive.

40
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:32,300
You always like
that spiral parking ramp.

41
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,219
You just keep turning left,
but you end up up!

42
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,387
I can't go
to Senor Kevin's.

43
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:36,513
The manager and I
are enemies.

44
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:37,932
He said
<i>Die Hard</i> was bad.

45
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:39,349
He said <i> Die Hard</i>
was bad.
I know, buddy.

46
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:40,976
Well, how about this.

47
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:44,103
This lunch is
already a runaway train,
no point in stopping it.

48
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,565
Troy, Britta, you go
to Senor Kevin's.

49
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,316
Abed promised
he'd show me how
the Dreamatorium works.

50
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,318
Today's the perfect day
for it.
But I want to...

51
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,362
Abed, don't you think
today's the perfect day
for it?

52
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:53,655
No.

53
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:56,450
Abed.
Is this a social cue?

54
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:59,745
I left my <i> Puttin' on the Ritz</i>
cane in here earlier.

55
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,414
I know it probably
has another name,

56
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:06,001
but, um, can I be
perfectly honest
with you guys?

57
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:08,128
I think I went too far
with this one.

58
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:12,049
I have to go
to the bank today.

59
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:13,801
What am I supposed to
tell people in line?

60
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,136
"I had good news
and bad news"?

61
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,932
Come on, Craig.
Get your life together.

<i>with temporary constable,</i>
<i>Geneva.</i>

76
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:21,160
Geneva, I need
the quantum spanner,
the big one.

77
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,203
Oi, gov'ner,
quantum spammer,
up an' at 'em, in'it?

78
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,207
If we can't get out
of orbital lock,

79
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,127
the Blorgons
may intercept.

80
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:31,503
Tut tut, m'lord.

81
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:34,464
Wouldn't give
a tuppence for
that sticky wicket.

82
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,300
Okay, stop simulation.

83
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:40,137
More British?
I can't do this anymore.

84
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:42,097
But the Blo-gons might
intercept...

85
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,390
It's Blorgons with an "r".

86
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,225
Blo-gon means "thank you"
in Blorgon.

87
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,977
Can't we play something
I know about

88
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:48,603
like hospital administration?

89
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:55,110
You're mad at me
for playing matchmaker
with Troy and Britta.

90
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,695
You think you're
gonna lose Troy.

91
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,530
I'm not petty, Annie.
I'm mad at you because
you tampered

92
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,657
with the fabric
of the group.

93
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,826
How do you know
Troy and Britta pairing up
wouldn't destroy everything?

94
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,995
I run the scenarios.
I examine this stuff from
every conceivable angle.

95
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:07,164
Oh, and you can do that
but I can't?

96
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:09,374
You don't have
a patent on being
a control freak, Abed.

97
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,085
I kind of do.

98
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:12,502
You think this is
just a room where
Troy and I play dinosaurs

99
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,337
versus river boat gamblers
together?

100
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,797
Sure, it's how I got
the construction approved,

101
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:19,134
but, much like myself,
the Dreamatorium
has higher functions.

102
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,594
Would you like me
to show you
how your stunt

103
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,096
with Troy and Britta
will play itself out?

104
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,346
Why not?

105
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,224
Execute simulation
Troy/Britta.

106
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,726
Render environment
Senor Kevin's.

107
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:32,313
(AS TROY)
Oh, those appetizers
were dope and legit!

108
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,608
(AS BRITTA)
I don't usually
support lunch

109
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,611
because it's unfair
to breakfast.

110
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:40,072
(AS TROY) I never
thought about meals
fighting each other.

111
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,200
I guess that explains
why you never

112
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:45,452
see any two of them
on the same table.

113
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,871
So I guess
Annie's pretty hot
to get us together.

114
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,331
She probably just doesn't
understand people.

115
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,792
Well, the sooner
the food comes,

116
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,210
the sooner
this will be over.

117
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,881
I'm afraid your food
won't be ready for
another half hour.

118
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:00,968
I'm too busy misunderstanding
the whole point of <i> Die Hard.</i>

119
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,139
I can't wait to
get home to Abed.

120
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,514
So you can dart
back and forth

121
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,142
doing impressions
of your friends.

122
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,893
There's no science
at work here.

123
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,312
You're right.

124
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,355
The science is
at work in here.

125
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:21,404
This is
the Dreamatorium's engine.

126
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,906
My thoughts are collected
by this box

127
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:25,075
and everything I know
about my friends
is stored here.

128
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:28,328
Both are distilled by logic
and then recombined
into objective observation.

129
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,830
I'm able to simulate
any of the study group

130
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,123
and even
a half-accurate Chang

131
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:33,792
in over 7,000
unique situations.

132
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,544
Abed, it's cardboard tubes
and a funnel.

133
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,879
Well, you see it that way
because it's calibrated

134
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,338
to a specific level
of brain function.

135
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,591
Right. I'm stupid.

136
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:44,343
Not stupid,
just less able to
see what I see.

137
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:47,181
Gee, you've got it
all figured out.

138
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:49,641
(PHONE RINGS)

139
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,726
King of toilet paper rolls
over here.

140
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,814
Hey, Troy,
I'm glad you called.

141
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,107
Your lunch is
going well, right?

142
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:58,692
Yeah, just checking
on Abed.

143
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,861
Making sure he's okay.

144
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,071
What? He's fine.

145
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:05,157
He just implied I operate
on a lower level

146
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,993
of brain function,
so business as usual.

147
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:11,370
Great, um, just,
you know, make sure
he stays comfortable.

148
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,706
I worry about him
when I'm not around.

149
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:17,002
Well, he's fine,
he always will be.

150
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:18,962
People bend over backwards
to cater to him.

151
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:21,798
He's just extra sensitive
in the Dreamatorium.

152
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,134
It takes a lot out of him
to run that thing.

153
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:25,260
I don't want you to
break his brain.

154
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:26,385
Bye, Troy.

155
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,556
How is he?
He'll be okay.

156
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,267
It's so sweet how much
you care about him.

157
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,186
And another thing
I hate about <i> Die Hard,</i>

158
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:36,395
two FBI agents
named Johnson?

159
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,735
I've been thinking about
our Inspector Spacetime
scenario.

160
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,904
It might work better
if instead of
playing Geneva,

161
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,030
you played Rosamund.

162
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,240
She was a constable
in Season Five

163
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,575
and she only
had three lines.

164
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,369
I have a better idea.

165
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,371
You know what would
make your scenarios
a lot more realistic?

166
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:53,496
If Troy weren't
on a date.

167
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,123
Why don't you take
all your thoughts

168
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:58,293
and your logic
and add one step
to the process.

169
00:06:58,335 --> 00:06:59,753
What are you doing?
From now on,

170
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,963
before you do
or say anything,

171
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:04,758
you're gonna think
about how it affects
the people around you.

172
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,177
We lower functioning brains
call this "empathy".

(HIGH-PITCHED WHIMPERING)

174
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,225
Abed?
(SCREAMS)

175
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,435
Abed?

176
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,522
Oh, my God,
I broke Abed.

177
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,986
Abed?

178
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,780
You know how
you wanted me to tell you

179
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,907
when you were
being scary weird
instead of cute weird?

180
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,284
This is scary weird.

181
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,247
Hello, Annie.

182
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,042
What was I doing
on the floor?

183
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,002
Were we doing it?

184
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,838
Are you being Jeff?

185
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,633
Well, I'm not
being a Kardashian.

186
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:47,926
So where are we now?

187
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:48,927
We're in
the doctor's lounge

188
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,804
of Greendale
Hospital School.

189
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,055
Hospital school?

190
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,848
It's a sexy
emotional school

191
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,311
where doctors save
lives and make love,
often simultaneously.

192
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:59,104
Our stories,
ripped from the headlines.

193
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:01,064
Our passions, unbridled.

194
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:02,774
Our cafeteria, eh...

195
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,944
Make love to me, Ann.

196
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,405
I know I'm just a surgeon
and you're a hotshot
upstart administrator,

197
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,073
but damn the rules,
damn the system,

198
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:13,076
damn our two foot
height disparity,
I want you.

199
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:16,163
Okay, Abed, I get it,
we have different
sensibilities.

200
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,497
Later.

201
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,710
Bye.

202
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,963
I'm leaving.

(SIGHS)

204
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,808
Okay, Dr. Jeff,

205
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,685
can you please tell me
where I can find Abed?

206
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:39,811
I owe him an apology.

207
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,730
Abed?
Never heard of him.

208
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:43,815
Terrific.

209
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:48,695
I asked you a question,
doctor.

210
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:51,448
I'm a surgeon!
And I'm your administrator!

211
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,283
I left my wife for you
and she was pregnant!

212
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:55,827
Who do you think
inseminated her?

213
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,829
Now tell me
what I want to know
or God as my witness,

214
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,289
I'll have
your stethoscope.

215
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:00,915
Fine.

216
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,042
Dr. Perry might know.

217
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:05,545
Render environment
bio lab.

218
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,549
Look,
there's Britta and Troy

219
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,592
fooling around
with each other.

220
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,887
Look, there's Abed having
overcome his issues.

221
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,138
Nice try.

222
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,182
Dr. Barnes, Dr. Perry.

223
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,728
We just saved an uninsured
homeless man's life.

224
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,231
Using an unapproved
procedure.

225
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,274
Now, we're going to kiss.

226
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,533
This is what
you think I want?

227
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,951
What do you want,
administrator?

228
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,412
I want to talk to Abed.

229
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:39,871
There's no one here
by that name.

230
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,249
You're lying.
Maybe I am, so what?

231
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,167
I was raised on
the mean streets
of Harlem.

232
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:45,210
I'm not scared of you.

233
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,087
Well, be scared of this.

234
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:54,094
Sodium pentothal,
known commonly
as truth serum.

235
00:09:56,513 --> 00:10:00,350
I saw Abed's name
in the hospital
school files,

236
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,143
I love butt stuff,
I hate spiders,

237
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,937
I stole a pen
from the bank,

238
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:07,732
I cried during <i> About a Boy..</i>.
<i>The Soundtrack...</i>

239
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,817
I don't wash my hands
before surgery.

240
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,112
I can see why women
find Clive Owen attractive
to the point

241
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,614
where I might
just as well be
attracted to him.

242
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,284
I use comparisons
to Hitler to win arguments
on the Internet

243
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,618
at the drop of a hat.

244
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,328
I know nothing about wine.

245
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,705
I'm more turned on by women
in pajamas than lingerie.

246
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,624
I just want to know
they feel comfortable.

247
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,503
I didn't get <i> Inception.</i>

248
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:31,256
(SOBBING)
I didn't get <i> Inception.</i>

249
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:34,134
(SOBBING CONTINUES)

250
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,927
You said you saw
his name in the files.

251
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,678
There's so many layers.

252
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,432
Right, render environment
medical study room.

253
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,059
There's head nurse,
Shirley,

254
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,270
talking to tragic,
heart-wrenching
Alzheimer's patient

255
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:48,273
and Emmy-contender,
Pierce Hawthorne.

256
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:51,192
Mr. Hawthorne,
you're out of
your bed again.

257
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:52,735
'Cause I think
I'm on a train.

258
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,654
Oh! Oh!

259
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,739
Shirley, get me
the file on Abed.

260
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,408
Abed doesn't exist,
young lady.

261
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,909
He exists if I say so.

262
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,161
This is my hospital school.

263
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,121
Your hospital school,
young lady, is a simulation

264
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,290
being run through a filter
of other people's needs.

265
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,125
Abed's been filtered out
because nobody needs him.

266
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,003
I need him.

267
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,045
Well, you're not simulated.

268
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,297
No, but this is!

269
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,673
(SLAP SOUND)
Ooh!

270
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,426
And there's more
where that didn't
come from.

271
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:18,136
This is a private
compartment.

272
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,305
Jeff, get the files.
Why me?

273
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:21,722
Because you can see
the cabinets.

274
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,725
And I'll make love to you.

275
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:25,935
Jackpot.

276
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:33,692
There is an Abed
in this hospital school,
but he's not a doctor.

277
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,446
He's a patient.

278
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,573
Notify security!
Conductor!

279
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,074
Jeff, take me to Abed.

280
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,284
Now where is that?

281
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,203
Enough games,
just take me
where I wanna go.

282
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:45,704
Follow me.

283
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,375
Are we close?

284
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,335
Almost there,
although you should
probably run in place

285
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:51,461
and let the hallway
move around you.

286
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,054
Here we are.
Where?

287
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,639
Where you wanted to go.

288
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:04,265
The last night of school,
first year.

289
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,561
The night we kissed.

290
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:11,105
Abed wasn't there,
so whose memory is this?

291
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,357
Maybe it's yours.

292
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,609
Maybe the Dreamatorium
really works.

293
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:17,028
Or maybe
Leonard was watching
from the bushes

294
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,072
and told Abed about it.

295
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,449
I don't have cable.

296
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:22,950
Knock it off, Abed.

297
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:26,705
I'm not Abed.
You're confused
and so was I.

298
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,289
But not anymore.

299
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,917
Jeff... Abed... Stop.

300
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,628
I don't wanna do this.
I wanna talk to Abed.

301
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:37,840
I'm taking the file.

302
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:43,221
Oh, it says Abed
is in the recovery parlor.

303
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,806
Condition, never better.

304
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,808
You're not holding anything.

305
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,812
This is the file.

306
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:55,442
Abed Nadir,
psychiatric patient 1373,

307
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,652
control freak
with no empathy.

308
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:00,863
People bend over backwards
to cater to him.

309
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,908
Signed,
healthcare administrator
Annie Edison.

310
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,621
That's out of context.

311
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:09,122
Shh.

312
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,998
You've thought
of everything, Annie.

313
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,126
With Abed gone and
Troy and Britta together,

314
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,211
there's nothing standing
in the way of us.

315
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,504
Wait, what?

316
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:19,340
Come on.
This is you dream.

317
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,884
This is why you
played matchmaker.

318
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,220
This is what's
important to you.

319
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,557
You are not Jeff.

320
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:30,017
Because Jeff cares
about Abed.

321
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,062
And I did not push
Troy and Britta together
so this would happen.

322
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:34,314
I did it because I thought
they were cute together

323
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,732
and this would
have been a bonus.

324
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:38,526
And we are not here.

325
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:42,363
And I'm not staying here
because I hate
whoever you are.

326
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:43,698
You should probably
storm off in...

327
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,823
Oof!

328
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,867
In place.

329
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:57,920
Where do you
wanna go next?

330
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,798
I wanna be alone.

331
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:01,633
Sounds good to me.

332
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,677
Execute simulation,
Annie/Annie.

333
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,766
There. Now we're alone.

334
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,519
Great, so you're me now.

335
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,021
Why are you blowing
our magic moment
with Jeff?

336
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,106
It's not magic.
It's not even real.

337
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,567
But we love Jeff.

338
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,862
No, we don't.

339
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:25,865
We're just in love
with the idea
of being loved.

340
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,659
And if we can teach a guy
like Jeff to do it,

341
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,327
we'll never be unloved.

342
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:32,330
So we keep running
the same scenario
over and over

343
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,790
hoping for
a different result.

344
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:35,333
Running scenarios.

345
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,751
Careful now.

346
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,169
You're starting
to sound like Abed.

347
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:44,050
So...
I probably shouldn't say
things like <i> "Star Wars.</i>

348
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,260
<i>"Zardoz, Cougar Town,</i>
cool, cool, cool."

349
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,804
Stop it.
Pop culture,
pop culture.

350
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:49,848
I'm on a TV show.
You're gonna get
in trouble.

351
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:51,891
Meta, meta.

352
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:53,685
It's Abed!

353
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,395
I got an Abed here!

354
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,896
Get him!

355
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:59,399
That's it.
I find you guilty
of being Abed.

356
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,734
You're under arrest!

357
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,068
Can I just
interject and say

358
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,027
I don't know what
the hell's going on?

359
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,663
This time
you'll never get out.

360
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:15,915
Abed?

361
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,086
Abed.

362
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,338
(ANNIE'S VOICE) Yeah.
I found you by turning
into you, how cool is that?

363
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,131
Cool.
Cool, cool, cool.

364
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,217
Tell me where we are
so I can pretend to see it.

365
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:30,054
We're inside a locker.
It's where I spent a lot
of time in junior high.

366
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,806
You think this is
where we'd put you?

367
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,474
You know
that's absurd, right?

368
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:34,975
Well, I'm not stupid.

369
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,728
You can see I've increased
the square footage.

370
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,145
It's a metaphorical locker.

371
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,522
It's a place where
people like me get put

372
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,441
when everyone's finally
fed up with us.

373
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:44,652
Abed, so maudlin.

374
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:45,904
If you start turning
into a vampire...

375
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,113
I've run the simulations,
Annie.

376
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:48,698
I don't get married,
I don't invent

377
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,408
a billion dollar website
that helps people have sex.

378
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,535
I don't make it
into Sundance,
Slamdance or dance pants.

379
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,120
Troy invents dance pants
in 2019.

380
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,413
Don't tell him,
he needs to
stumble onto it.

381
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:56,956
All right, listen.

382
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,458
The scenarios
you run in here

383
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:02,002
are like great
science fiction.

384
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:05,423
They're impressive
and detailed
and insightful,

385
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,801
but they're not
accurate for crap.

386
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,385
Science fiction
never has been.

387
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,178
Look at <i> 2001.</i>

388
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,680
Did we have
a space odyssey?

389
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:15,057
No, we got snowboarding
in the Olympics

390
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,893
and we over-validated
Carson Daly.

391
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,937
That poor guy.
Yeah, cry me a river.

392
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,772
My point is,
your simulations

393
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,649
are nothing more
than anxieties.

394
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,900
You're afraid
you don't fit in.

395
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,318
You're afraid
you'll be alone.

396
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:28,988
Great news.
You share that
with all of us,

397
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:32,158
so you'll never be alone
and you'll always fit in.

398
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,161
And, yes,
that's why I meddled
with Troy and Britta.

399
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,203
You caught me.

400
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,622
I was trying
to make life go

401
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,457
according to
some script.

402
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,585
I can't.
You can't.

403
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:45,880
We both need to get more
comfortable winging it.

404
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,632
At least it'll
be less work.

405
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,801
It would cut down
my Dreamatorium time
by 18 hours a week.

406
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,010
I could take up yoga.

407
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,012
You've got
the body type.

408
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,889
Now, let's get you
out of here.

409
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,224
I don't know how.
These fake shackles
don't have a fake key.

410
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,687
Isn't that what
a quantum spanner's for?

411
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,355
Technically, no.

412
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:05,024
But that's fine.

413
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,277
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLES)

414
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,240
So should we
get back to lunch?

415
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,159
I guess so.
A little more anticlimactic

416
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,619
than I would have
simulated it,
but whatever.

417
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:19,079
Anticlimactic?

418
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:22,709
Render environment
observo-deck,
HMS <i> Spacetime 12.</i>

419
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,631
Inspector,
set the tachyon drive
to hyperjump.

420
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:30,758
We must get to
the other side
of this star field

421
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,092
before the Blorgons
intercept.

422
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,722
Blorgons in this sector?

423
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,224
Well, this mission has gone
pear-shaped, indeed.

424
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,142
Prepare to hyperjump
on my mark.

425
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,729
Bugger the dovecotes,
Inspector.

426
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,231
We're too late!
Blorgons!

427
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:48,150
<i>Eradicate! Eradicate!</i>

428
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,611
Our quantum blasters
are useless
against their armor.

429
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:53,197
We're as cooked
as Lord Nelson's
mutton, we are.

430
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,033
Not if I can help it.

431
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,828
I'll see you on
the other side, Inspector.
Wherever that is.

432
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,205
Don't you mean
"whenever that is"?

433
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,709
(BATTLECRY)

434
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,921
Take that, Blorgon scum!

435
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:09,672
You'll blo-gon me
for this later.

436
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,383
Ow, Annie!

437
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,093
Oh, oh, my God!

438
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,929
Abed, I'm so sorry.

439
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,555
No, no,
you're committing.

440
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:18,681
This is good stuff.

441
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,099
Thanks.

442
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,644

449
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,161
I'm hungry.
Are you hungry?
Yeah.

450
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,914
I'll make us
buttered noodles.

451
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:46,166
<i>Using an elusive</i>
<i>new technique</i>
<i>known as "empathy".</i>

452
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,546
So was the other
fast food place worth
the drive, Shirley?

453
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:52,298
You know,
half way there I thought,
"What am I doing?

454
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,383
It's the same
fast food place
in a different location.

455
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:56,886
"Have the margins
of my life become
so narrow?"

456
00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:58,721
So I went to the mall
and had pizza.

457
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:00,473
I beat <i> The Matrix</i> today.

458
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:03,267
Sounds like this has been
a game-changing day
for all of us.

459
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,144
I almost sat on my balls,

460
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:08,397
but at the last second,
I made an adjustment.

461
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:10,316
Good job!
Good work.

462
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,317
Good job, man.

463
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,319
Well, we had
a good lunch, too.

464
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,362
Yeah.

465
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,239
I spoke to the manager
about <i> Die Hard,</i>

466
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,491
and I told him
he should be
ashamed of himself.

467
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,660
Thanks.

468
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,202
Sorry I bailed
on the Dreamatorium.

469
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,246
It's okay, Annie did
pretty good in a pinch.

470
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,500
All right,
back to cramming?

471
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,546
The people at the bank
loved my outfit.

472
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,008
And they had all kinds of
questions about it

473
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,550
and my answers
seemed to amuse

474
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,178
and...and even
liberate them a little.

475
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,930
A few of us went
to lunch

476
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:44,934
and I had the deepest
conversation of my life.

477
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:47,269
I gotta go,
I'm telling everybody.

478
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:51,398
Hmm, maybe after
a long, dark night,

479
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,109
the sun is starting
to rise on Greendale.

480
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:55,903
Maybe. Maybe not.

481
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:57,363
You never can tell
what kind of day
you're gonna have.

482
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:01,492
Okay, I didn't really
avoid sitting on them.

483
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:02,618
I sat right on them.

484
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,995
Oh.
Aw.

485
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,329
I'm sorry.
Pierce, I'm sorry.

486
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:06,664
Hurt like hell.

487
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,207
I saw eagles.

Today we're joined

00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:16,549
Hi!
Who's gonna
show us how

491
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,092
to spruce up your
apartment on a budget.

492
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,802
So, Annie,
what inspired
this throw?

493
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,846
Well, I just thought
that I'd cover up
the stain

494
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:23,931
where Abed spilled Code Red
on the couch last week.

495
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:25,307
Oops. Crafty.

496
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,893
And you have some tips
on entertaining.

497
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,602
Yes, if you're
expecting company,

498
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,230
but you don't
have enough chairs,
you can bring out

499
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:35,109
pillows from your bedroom
and use them on the floor
for a Moroccan feel.

500
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:37,361
Ooh, a taste
of the Orient.
Ooh!

501
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,697
Actually, boys, I have
a little surprise for you.

502
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:40,865
Uh-oh.
While you two were out

503
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:42,158
playing blazer tag...

504
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,450
That's laser tag
with sport coats.

505
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:47,454
I did a little extreme
bedroom makeover!

506
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,374
I unbunked your beds
and got scrap fabric and...

507
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,835
(HIGH-PITCHED WHINE)

508
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:54,336
It's okay, buddy.
We can put it back.

509
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,963
We can put it back
the way it was.
