Where did you get this?

20
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,469
Some one-armed guy
with a scar on his
face dropped it off.

21
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:53,679
He said he was
Star-Burns' lawyer.

22
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:54,972
How one-armed was he?

23
00:00:55,014 --> 00:00:56,306
Tell me when to stop.

24
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:00,978
It was the other arm.
You guys!

25
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,146
I feel oddly compelled
to fulfill his request.

26
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,982
Would you guys help me
write obituary copy?

27
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:08,569
You mean like, "Star-Burns
died how he lived.
In a meth lab explosion"?

28
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,988
Can we turn this off?
I'm not as comfortable
with death as you guys.

29
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,280
He's in a better
place now.

32
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:18,078
Star-burns also
left me his ashes.

33
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,454
He requested
they be burnt.

34
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:20,789
I don't think he knows
how ashes work.

35

do celebrity impressions?

about the holocaust

I'm talking
about Star-Burns,
you know, dying.

49
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,716
I know it's sad, but death
is a natural part of life

50
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,051
and by the time
I finish this sentence,

I have to
call my pen pal.

54
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,768
Star-Burns was a good man.

55
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,645
He barely
sued me that time
I ran over his foot.

56
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,939
I say we honor Star-Burns
by discussing him

57
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:28,440
the same amount we did
when he was alive.

58
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,734

have some respect.

63
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,911
Okay, good, I gotta go.
This costs $7.

64
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:45,540
But he was also a classmate,
a kinda sorta friend sometimes

65
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,793
and above all,
a human being.

66
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,210
He touched all our lives.

67
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,378
Annie has a point.

68
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,422
The death of a peer,
especially at our age,

69
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,842
can trigger a whole
range of emotions.

76
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,396
Great.
Yeah.

77
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,357
I was hoping
you'd say that, because

78
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,192
I came prepared.

79
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,279

a chance to say to me.

00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:33,839

Ask me something else.

87
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,550
Have you seen
Tim Russert?

88
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,178
Guys, you are
doing this wrong.
Ask me something personal.

89
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,470
Star-Burns,
I didn't know
you that well,

90
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:41,889
but why did you smell
exactly like salami?

91
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,349
Abed.
I got one.
Where's my comb?

92
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,851
I don't know.
Yep, it's him.

93
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,895
Why did you
tape that switchblade
to your ankle?

94
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,437
Why did you always poop
with the stall door open?

95
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,647
Is it true you
made out with Britta?

96
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,024
I don't see
how that's relevant.

97
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:53,650
It was fat Neil's
black light party.

98
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,944
Vicki saw you.
If that's true...

99
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:59,865
If. Maybe it was because
she was really drunk

100
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:02,784
and she had just found out
that her first boyfriend
was getting married.

101
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:05,495
If you guys are gonna
do this wrong, then
I'm gonna take these off.

no larger
than three ounces.

I'm sorry, Chang,
this stuff is too extreme.

122
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,879
This is a community college,
not an inner-city high school.

123
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,173
It's a community college
where a degenerate

124
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,341
just blew himself up
with stolen lab equipment.

125
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,510
To be fair,
it was the crystal meth

126
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,346
inside the stolen
lab equipment
that blew him up.

127
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,348
That's the problem

128
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,309

how the sausage gets made.

130
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,562
Well, I'll tell you
how the sausage gets made.

131
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:14,940
It's a lot of ground
meat and it gets
stuffed into a casing

132
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,943
that looks like a cross
between a dude's
dong and a poop.

133

how that helps me,
but please leave.

will regret this.

144
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,604

he's catching fire too.

(SOBBING) Britta!

146
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,400
Why are you making us
feel these things?

147
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:02,529
We need to bring
our emotions to the surface
and explore them.

148
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,072
Does it always have
to be puppies though?

149
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,699
Oh, come on, everybody.

150
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,534
This is a completely
unnecessary process.

151
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,452
What Jeff's
doing right now
is called denial

152
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,496
and it is the first
of five stages of grief

153
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,581
that ends with acceptance.

154
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,374
Name any other stage.
What are you, my final?

155
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,336
Maybe we don't need
grief counseling.

156
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:19,213
But seems like
the least we could do

157
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:20,964
is have a memorial
or something.

158
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:23,091
Oh, yes, we could
have a little service

159
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,509
and I could bring
some of my brownies

160
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,303
and I guess someone
should sing <i> Ave Maria.</i>

161
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:28,096
I mean,
I can do it. Whatever.

162
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:29,723
Sure, why not
drag it out for weeks?

163
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,808
Why not wallow
for the rest of our lives

164
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,768
and never
get anything done?

165
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,064
Or we could just admit
the simple fact that one day,

166
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:40,608
something is in your life
and one day, it's not.

I understand you wanted

to sing something as well?
No, thank you.

188
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:58,603
Okay, then let's move
on to the eulogies.

189

Does anyone have
anything they wanna say
in the memory of Star-Burns?

190

Oh! Because his sideburns
were shaped like stars.

I just got that.

Anything at all.

say what you're feeling.

After learning about
Star-Burns' death,

197
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:26,756
I personally went through
the stages of grief

198
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,591
and have now arrived

199
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,927
at the final one,

200
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,304
Whoo! Closure!

Acceptance
that this place,

202
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:38,518
this fallujah
of higher learning

203
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,562
is a prison from
which none of us
will ever escape.

204
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,273
Okay, Jeffrey,
now we're mixing
metaphors here...

205
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:45,066
And it turns out

206
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:49,737
that Star-Burns,
this man in this urn,

207
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,157
was a hero to us
the whole time

208
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,908
because he did
the one thing

209
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,619
that none of us
ever tried to do.

210
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:58,538
He got out.

211
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,710
And then he exploded.

212
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,380
Because Greendale
hates its students.

213
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:09,257
No. No.
It sucks the lives
from their bodies

214
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:13,011
and forces
their desiccated husks
to attend summer school.

215
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:16,306
Okay, Jeffrey,
this is a funeral.
Let's keep it light.

216
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,016
Annie, Annie,
maybe you could say

217
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,268
something nice
about Star-Burns.

218
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,187
Get some sugar
to go with that spice.

MAN: Way to go, Jeff.

220
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:31,112
Star-Burns or Alex,
as he like to be called,

221
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:33,156
was a human being.

222
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,116
A Greendale human being.

223
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,576
Like me.

224
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:42,374
I've given this place
my childhood,

225

my enthusiasm,
and my loyalty,

226
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,795
and in return,
Greendale has warped me

227
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,964
like a barbie
in a microwave.

228
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:53,593

community college
in our community.

Let that sink in.

232
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:06,189
And the cherry
on top on this
total lack of sundae,

233
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:11,319
I'm failing
a remedial biology
class on a technicality

how to run a school.

um, was a drug dealer.

Which, of course,
is not good behavior.

Which... But he...
It was a business.

an entrepreneurial spirit.

Dreams of opening
a sandwich shop
in this cafeteria.

251
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,665
And Greendale listened
to those dreams,

252
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:06,791
and stole them.

253
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,962
And sold them to Subway.

replaced around here is you.

343
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,221
Oh, my god, it's me.

344
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,348
(GASPS) I will...

345
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:38,688
The single worst wake riot
this district has ever seen.

346
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,190
And we've seen our share.

347
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:45,820
Tables, chairs, floors,
ceilings, all affected.

348
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:50,074
A campus
already in mourning
is pushed into chaos.

349
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,159
And sitting here
facing me now,

350
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,454
the so-called
Greendale Seven.

351
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:58,917
Reportedly responsible
for inciting the
entire chain of events.

352
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,962
This is some
pretty serious stuff.

353
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,925
Sir.

354
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:11,137
Although my friends
and I behaved
somewhat irresponsibly,

355
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,973
we shouldn't forget about
the circumstances on campus.

356
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:17,393
We had just
lost a classmate.

357
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:20,187
And a lizard,
Your Majesty.

358
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:26,319
It was an emotional time
and we acted emotionally.

359
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,072
But the real question is,
how did the school respond?

360
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,117
The riot was exacerbated

361
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,286
by the school
security staff's

362
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:38,080
heavy-handed and,
frankly, insane response.

363
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,416
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Hey, everyone.

364
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,042
Oh, so sorry
to pop in like this.

365
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,336
I really hope
I'm not interrupting.

366
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,922
Just wanted to see how
everything's going,

367
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:47,298
and those are
for you fellows.

368
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,509
I never forget a face
or a favorite cookie.

369
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,552
And I brought extras,
because I know how Richie

370
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:54,013
got into that
last basket I brought.
(ALL LAUGHING)

371
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,015
Probably good
to have a backup.

372
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,977
I did. I did get into
them pretty good.

373
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,395
So everything going okay?

374
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,356
Or are you guys going to
trash this building too?

375
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,525
Yeah, we were just
going over the charges.

376
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,819
Seems like you
had your hands full
with these individuals.

377
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,362
This is crazy.

378
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,656
You guys are
really buying this?
Excuse me?

379
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,575
Chang is a psychopathic
wannabe warlord

380
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,911
with an army
of prepubescent thugs.

381
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:20,874
He was living
in the school's air
vent system with a monkey!

382
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,166
That's not...

383
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,877
Well, where's the dean?
He'll tell you.

384

Hey, guys.
Can't stay, gotta run,

385
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,840
but, uh,
these troublemakers
have got to go.

I've heard enough,

387
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,763

what choice I have.

Yep.

Okay,

13 years of college
down the drain.

398
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:11,340
I was gonna be
the first one in my family

399
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:13,593
to graduate from
community college.

400

Everyone else graduated
from normal college.

401

Now they're really gonna
give me a hard time.

Yeah, well, my life
can't get double ruined.

Can't believe
we're expelled.

Greendale was our home.

405
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,232
Britta, isn't it time
for you to explain

406
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,650
that every failure
is also an opportunity?

407
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:32,319
Whatever, I'm the worst.
I'm also the worst.

408
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,864

but I am gonna forgive you.

who gets it?

411
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,829
I'll get it.

412
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,999
You guys remember our
housewarming party?

413
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,543
What would have happened
if I had just let Jeff
roll the die that night?

414
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:49,879
I assumed this
was the best timeline,
but what if it's the darkest?

415
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:52,423
Well, I don't
think anyone knows
what you're talking about,

416
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,550
but it does seem like things
couldn't get any worse.

417
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,142
No.

get through this.

you're not the worst.

421
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,153
You're the best.

422
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,950
He's right.
Things are bad.

423

But we're together.

424
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:22,996
That makes this
the perfect timeline.

425
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,205

There are other timelines?
