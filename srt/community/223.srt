353
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:10,775
You want me to call 911?

354
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:13,319
Sucker!
Son of a bitch, seriously?

355
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,946
Told you, dude.
I'm the best!

356
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:17,865
You're the worst.
I'm out of the group?

357
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,492
You're out of mine!

358
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,870
And I'm winning!
We've created a monster.

359
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,081
Let's not give ourselves
too much credit.

360
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:28,042
I'm out. Some old guy pretended
to have a heart attack.

361
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,460
Shot me in the gut.

362
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,505
I don't care,
that's your problem.

363
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:35,008
This school sucks.
Well, then why do you go here?

364
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:38,511
I wouldn't go to this toilet
with my big sister's toe.

365
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,220
I take a class online.

366
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,806
I was paid to be here
and win the game

367
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:43,223
so my boss
could keep his money.

368
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,726
You work for
the ice cream company?

369
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,937
Sweetie, this thing
is so much bigger

370
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:50,731
than you can even imagine.

371
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:54,443
I'm out of here,
I got Coldplay tickets.

372
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,778
Coldplay?

373
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:58,322
Too late, bean allergy,
you blew it.

374
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,783
CHANG:
<i>Hello?</i>

375
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:04,370
Anybody?

376
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,331
Does anyone have
an alliance I can join?

377
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,542
I'm really loyal.

378
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:13,087
[SCREAMING]

379
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,094
Am I out?

380
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:25,558
MAN 1:
In formation.
Blue Leader, standing by.

381
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:28,061
Blue Leader, stand by.

382
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:29,520
MAN 2:
Red 5, standing by.

383
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,105
MAN 3:
White Clones, standing by.

384
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:33,066
PATTY:
On your knees.

385
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:37,070
No Greendale student can be
allowed to win this game.

386
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:41,824
Initiate Plan B:
Operation Total Invasion.

387
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:50,083
Greendale students,
I understand you've unified

388
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,710
<i>and intend</i>
<i>to draw this game out.</i>

389
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:57,381
<i>Well, if it's a war you want,</i>
<i>it's a war you shall lose.</i>

390
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:01,052
<i>Resistance is as pointless</i>
<i>as your degrees.</i>

[♪♪♪]

392
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,514
Are we the Little Rascals?
I was.

393
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,934
I'm the dean,
stop shooting me!

394
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,602
We're gonna lose
this war and school.

395
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,604
This is it.
We're dying out here.

396
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,606
I had a dream it'd end this way.
Once I'm gone, I'm gone.

397
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:16,316
I'll see you in hell.
That's the tip of the iceberg.
