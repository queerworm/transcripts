00:00:01,961 --> 00:00:04,505
WOMAN: <i> A new day has</i>
<i>dawned at Greendale</i>
<i>Community College.</i>

2
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:06,256
<i>Some said</i>
<i>we'd never bounce back</i>

3
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:09,009
<i>after the unfortunate events</i>
<i>of the star-burns wake riot</i>

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,052
<i>instigated by</i>
<i>the Greendale seven.</i>

5
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:13,639
<i>But today</i>
<i>the guilty parties</i>
<i>have been expelled,</i>

6
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:15,015
<i>enrollment is up,</i>

7
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:17,392
<i>and tuition is more</i>
<i>affordable than ever.</i>

8
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,645
<i>The architect of</i>
<i>this modern-day miracle?</i>

9
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:22,021
<i>Security chief</i>
<i>Benjamin Franklin Chang,</i>

10
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:24,232
<i>a man who has</i>
<i>brought security, harmony,</i>

11
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,151
<i>and success to what</i>
<i>is fast becoming</i>

12
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,529
<i>the area's premier</i>
<i>community college.</i>

13
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,489
<i>Greendale's</i>
<i>never been better.</i>

14
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,282
<i>Thanks, Chang.</i>

15
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:34,618
You see?
It's not the real dean.

16
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,371
Of course.
The head of security at
Greendale community college

17
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:40,040
has kidnapped the dean
and replaced him with

18
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:42,250
a deanel-ganger.

19
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,419
Well, when you
say it that way,
it sounds ridiculous.

20
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,421
Yeah, the word we used
was doppel-deaner.

21
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,465
Look, I hate cops.

22
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:52,553
You have to
do something.

23
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:53,637
Isn't this a felony?

24
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,597
Chang is holding a man
against his will.

25
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:58,308
The real dean
never would have
expelled us.

26
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,476
He loved us.

27
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:02,312
Unfortunately, love is
not admissible evidence.

28
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:03,898
Oh.

32
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:16,493
Fine.
We'll get some proof.

33

No, you won't.

34
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:21,081
If I catch any of you
within 50 feet of Greendale,
I'll throw you all in jail.

35
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,753
Thanks for the hot water.

36
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:28,756

How's the planning
going for my birthday
Chang-stravaganza?

45
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,713
The magician's booked,
and the invitations went out

46
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,172
to the school board
and the Budweiser frogs.

47
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,215
Perfect.

48
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,342
Yeah, um,
one little snag.

49
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,261
See, we're kind of
running out of money,

50
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:17,930
what with all the
students dropping out

51
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:19,347
and the cost of your throne.

52
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,182
It's a prescription throne.

53
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,851
I have back mumps.

54
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:24,519
Don't look it up.
It's rare.

55
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,271
But you might be right.

56
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,899
We should free up
some revenue for
entertainment at the party.

57
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:30,442
Where's my deanel-Chang-er?

58
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:35,948
Fire the custodial staff.

59
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,659
Okay. Cool.

60
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,786
Do you think I could
get out a little early?

61
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:41,745
My wife's getting
her braces off, and...

62
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:43,455
No.
Okay.

63
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,048
I love how binoculars
make far away things

64
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,591
seem like they're close.
They're like...

65
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:56,969
BOTH: Telephones

66
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:58,762
Snagged one
of those flyers.

67
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:00,472
(GASPS) First Chang
kidnaps the dean,

68
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,683
and now he throws himself
a birthday party?

69
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,435
It's just like Stalin
back in Russia times.

70
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,062
Dance-off?
Sundae bar?

71
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:08,856
One of those Ed Hardy
street magicians?

72
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,191
What kind of
monster would...

73
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,361
(GASPS)
Photo booth with props!

74
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,113
Chang's got to be holding
the dean on campus,

75
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:18,032
but there's no way we're
gonna get past those guards.

76
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:19,574
We need somebody
on the inside.

77
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,620
I may know a guy.

78
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:25,914
And the air-conditioning
repair annex won't admit

79
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:27,833
to any knowledge
of what's going on.

80
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,752
But the fact is,

81
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:33,130
wherever there is air,
we have eyes.

82
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,465
Gross.

83
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:38,343
Suffice it to say,
if Chang were holding
your dean captive,

84
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,637
it'd be pretty foolish
to hold him on campus.

85
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:43,682
It'd be even
more foolish to hold him
in a central air room

86
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,476
in the cafeteria,
which we monitor.

87
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,395
<i>Oh, no, Jeffrey.</i>

88
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:51,439
<i>Looks like PB and J again.</i>

89
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,317
<i>You win the bet.</i> (LAUGHS)

90
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,694
So he's in
the cafeteria building?

91
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:58,238
Suppose he is.
In the basement.

92
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,823
And suppose you
wanted to get to him.

93
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:02,034
<i>Suppose you actually</i>
<i>managed to make it</i>

94
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:03,368
<i>past the guards</i>
<i>at the front,</i>

95
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,120
<i>there's 50 more inside,</i>
<i>armed to the teeth</i>

96
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,998
<i>with stun batons</i>
<i>and misplaced</i>
<i>sexual aggression.</i>

97
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,708
<i>Let's say you happen</i>
<i>to get past them</i>

98
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,585
<i>and then you get to meet</i>
<i>Chang's number one,</i>

99
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:16,339
<i>Joshua,</i>
<i>a 4'10", 105-pound bucket</i>
<i>of piss and zit cream.</i>

100
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:19,176
I cannot express
to you how much
I hate this kid.

101
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:22,387
<i>Now, beyond</i>
<i>that dog sneeze</i>
<i>in a pair of Reeboks,</i>

102
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:25,140
<i>you're gonna find</i>
<i>a state-of-the-art keypad</i>
<i>on the basement door.</i>

103
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:28,143
And just for extra fun,
they change the code
every day,

104
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:31,188
and the only copy is
locked up in Chang's office.

105
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,773
Now, just for a lark,

106
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,316
let's pretend you
actually make it down
to the basement door.

107
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,777
<i>Who is there to greet you?</i>

108
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,071
<i>Another guard</i>
<i>and another lock</i>

109
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:40,280
<i>to which there is</i>
<i>only one key.</i>

110
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:42,824
<i>And where is that key?</i>

111
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:50,165
Well, where is it?

112
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:52,584
Oh, sorry,
it's very clear in my head.

113
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,086
Key's around Chang's neck.

114
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:56,296
The point is,
you're not getting down
there without our help.

115
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,132
So help us.

116
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:00,801
We have
no horse in this race,

117
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,302
but there is
one thing we want.

118
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,975
Not a lot of people
get a second chance.

119
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,310
Just you
and probably Obama.

120
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,397
Give it some thought.

121
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,693
Great, so according
to Troy's intel,

122
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:19,820
Greendale is impregnable.

123
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,947
So what do we do?
Only one answer.

124
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,240
Elaborate heist?
Elaborate heist?

125
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:25,867
We'll need disguises.
I do a great swami.

126
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,744
Of course it works
best with a cobra,

127
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,412
but if you guys cut me
a length of garden hose...

128
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,455
Are we all forgetting
that if we get caught

129
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,082
on that campus,
we go to jail?

130
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:33,875
Do you know
how long someone
as sarcastic as I am

131
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,543
would last in prison?

132
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,587
Such a long time.

133
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:40,048
There's got to be
a practical way to do this.

134
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,925
There is another way in.

135
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:45,095
If I enroll
in the AC school,
they'll help us.

136
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:46,471
We could walk in and out.

137
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:47,848
It'll mean I'll have
to move out of here

138
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,516
and into
AC school housing,

139
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:52,102
and I won't be
able to hang out
with you guys anymore,

140
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:55,105
or have a relationship,
or use the word "sensational"
for some reason.

141
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:57,899
Troy, we are
not losing you
to save the dean

142
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:01,111
or Greendale.
Or anything, ever.

143
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:07,492
Don't be so
dramatic, Troy.
The answer is simple.

144
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,995
We just have to plan
an elaborate heist.

145
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:12,039
Yes.
Great, I'll get my turban.

146
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,374
Everyone except Pierce has
to plan an elaborate heist.

148

Now go party
your butts off.

00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,778
Troy and Abed,
you make a run for it.

341
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,863
Dean, I think
it's time to party.

342
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,531
Hmm.

343
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,118
Hey, what the freak?

344
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,494
(ELECTRONIC DANCE MUSIC)
BOY: What's going on?

345
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:55,246
(SCREAMS)

346
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,372
No! No! No!

347
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,249
You weigh nothing!
I can't see them.

348
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,959
They're too many of them.

349
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,631
Oof.
Baboof.

350
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,471
Which wire do I cut?
There's only one.

351
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,765
God, I hope I'm right.

352
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,863
Study group!

353
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,993
You did it!
So we're done, right?

354
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,995
We're done?
Done, done, done?

355
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,956
Not done.

356
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,333
You foiled me
for the last time.

357
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,005
(LAUGHING WICKEDLY)

358
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:49,843
So, it ends as it began.

359
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:52,136
It didn't begin this way.

360
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,554
What the hell's
going on in here?

361
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,974
Hey, fellas.

362
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,433
I just caught
the Greendale seven

363
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,352
trying to burn down
the school.

364
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,896
I'm a hero.
How about that cake?

365
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,857
He's lying.
He kidnapped the dean.

366
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,817
Yeah, we gathered that much
when we found these two

367
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,151
slap-fighting
in the hallway.

368
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,194
You stole my life!

369
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:11,030
It is hard out there
for a fake Moby!

370
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,827
Carl, Richie,
let me ex-Chang.

371
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,915
I'm not getting
paid, am I?

372
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,335
Hey!

373
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:27,421
So a madman
in a napoleon costume

374
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,883
ran the school
into the ground
and almost blew it up?

375
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:31,759
Yeah.
And on our watch.

376
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:33,845
What happened to us?

377
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:35,930
Well, I have
a drinking problem.

378
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,974
We're going to get fired.

379
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,768
Only a matter of time
until everyone finds out
what happened here.

380
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,562
Nobody can sit
on something this big.

381
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,271
I'll sit on it.

382
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:48,108
When I became dean,
I made a pledge

383
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,819
to swallow
this school's failures

384
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:52,196
and spit out degrees
because that's

385
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:55,658
what deans do.

386
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,868
You'd do that for us?

387
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,327
No.

388
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:00,038
I do it for Greendale.

GIRLS: Aw.

390
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,457
It's great to
have you back, Craig.

391
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,836
It's almost as if you were
never unknowingly gone.

(LAUGHS)

393
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,464
Perfect. I left
my credit card there.

394
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,799
Thanks, Craig.

395
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,887
You guys saved me.

396
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:18,431
I don't know
how I will ever repay you.

397
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,017
You already have.

Troy, you don't
have to do this.

The AC school has
no claim on your soul.

401
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:33,195
No, but I do.

402
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,614
A man's only as good
as his word,

403
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,866
or his nod through a camera
to a guy with a button.

Or do, if you want,
I'm not your boss.

When you finally finish
that jigsaw puzzle,

414
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:22,036
will you tell me
what kind of boat is
at the end of that dock?

415

This is a lock of my hair.

What did he say to you?

421
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,964
He said, "I know
you hate when people
do this in movies."

this hard house!

This is my school!

428
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:48,581
It's called Greendale,
and I'm the dean
of the entire school.

429

I mean,
I wasn't for a while,
but it's a long story.

You guys, everybody,

431
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,964

during the day sometime.
