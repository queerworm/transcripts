00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,655
(HISSES)
(GASPS) I'm sorry.

177
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:30,075
We just finished
telling him about it,

178
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,410
and you grab it
and squeeze it?

179
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,911
I said I was sorry.

180
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:36,331
Uh-huh. And so as a group,
do you always indulge Abed

181
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,208
in these little
misadventures?

182
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,918
Take that back.

183
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,879
Our adventures
are very manly.

184
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,049
I have to say
there's more important

185
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,302
to mental health
than a support system.

186
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:51,846
And assuming that
this group is, for Abed,
said support system,

187
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,349
I think
I've heard everything
I need to hear

188
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,476
in order
to make a decision.

189
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,519
I think that Abed
should be committed.

190
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:03,191
You mean committed
to his character work,
right?

191
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,610
Because he already is.
Abed, show him
your Don Draper.

192
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:06,694
Cigarettes.

193
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,489
(LAUGHTER)
No, I mean an institution.

194
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,117
You mean like marriage?

195
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,285
I mean
a mental institution.

196
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,245
Ah. So do I.

197
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,497
Will someone
please help me
lighten the mood?

198
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:25,755
(SOBBING) Please,
Mr. Dr. Psychiatrist, sir,

199
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,383
please don't
send my best friend
to crazy people jail.

200
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,051
Relax.
He doesn't have the right.

201
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:31,345
Abed's not dangerous.

202
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:34,264
Yeah,
he's just unique,
like a snowflake

203
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:35,556
who gets
bent out of shape

204
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,267
when you mix up <i> Star Wars</i>
and <i> Space Treks.</i>

205

Or a serial killer's
signature.

206
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,854
I'm a psych major.

207
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,064
His continued obsession with
Greendale Community College

208
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,066
suggests the potential
for escalation.

209
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,986
And, frankly, these stories
you've been telling me
are very troubling.

210
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,363
You're troubled?

211
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,490
I don't remember any
of those things happening.

212
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,074
Since when do these three
live together?

213
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,994
Look, Abed's obsession
with Greendale
doesn't make him crazy.

214
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,204
If you had gone
to school there,

215
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,621
you'd be obsessed
with it too.

216
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,790

We had lockers.
