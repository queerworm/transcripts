1
00:00:01,168 --> 00:00:03,211
His name
is Archie Decoste.

2
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:06,465
Age, 22,
total years spent
in high school, seven.

3
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:08,342
SAT score zero.

4
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:11,512
And he was
recently arrested
for selling marijuana

5
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:14,097
to a police officer
at a police station.

6
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,725
So, you want us
to help you
recruit this idiot

7
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:19,520
instead of an honors student
or a science genius?

8
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,229
Do we go
to the same Greendale?

9
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:24,942
Ah, but let me reveal
the fortune inside
this cookie.

10
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:27,945
Family net worth,
$8 million.

11
00:00:27,987 --> 00:00:30,781
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is what we

12
00:00:30,823 --> 00:00:33,784
in the community college
recruiting game
call a "whale."

13
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:36,620
The perfect mix
of low intellect,

14
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:37,788
high lack of ambition,

15
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,832
and limitless
parental support.

16
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:42,626
So, a rich dumb-dumb
who will never graduate

17
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:45,086
and keep dropping money
into the school indefinitely.
Got it.

18
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,755
Is there really
that much money
in this, Dean,

19
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:48,007
or is it like
that endorsement deal

20
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:50,217
you made
with Let's potato chips?

21
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:53,094
If you don't like
the crispy-licious taste
of Let's,

22
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,681
feel free to eat
that other greasy brand.

23
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:57,516
Splingles?
Not this guy.

24
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:58,851
Thank you, Troy,

25
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:01,020
and, I will explain
the value

26
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,856
of this whale
by describing one

27
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:05,399
who's been swimming
right under your nose.

28
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,986
Pierce Hawthorne
has taken 80%

29
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:11,154
of Greendale's classes
more than twice.

30
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,156
He is the only
Greendale student

31
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,242
who has ever paid
for a premium locker

32
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:17,995
or the extended
pencil warranty.

33
00:01:18,037 --> 00:01:20,039
Pierce cannot know
about this.

34
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,041
He's a big baby
who throws tantrums

35
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,083
when anyone else
gets attention.

36
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,336
Remember when Kerri Strug
visited our campus?

37
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:27,963
That was horrible.
That was awful.

38
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:30,632
I have scheduled
Archie's visit for tomorrow

39
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,634
when Pierce
has no classes.

40
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,553
Guys, I'm asking,

41
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,722
as treasurer
of the Forensics Club.

42
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:39,016
The dean said we could use
some of the whale money
for a new body farm.

43
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:40,392
Mmm.
Who wants to help?

44
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:41,852
I'm in.
Sounds like a romper.

45
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:43,311
We do need money.

46
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,064
The biology department's
been dissecting

47
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,982
the same dead pig
for 10 years.

48
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,358
If we land this kid,

49
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,944
we can buy
100 dead pigs

50
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:51,486
and make everybody happy.

51
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,488
I'll help where I can,
but I started
a new PE class.

52
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,907
I've been avoiding it
for three years,

53
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:56,617
but you can't run
from running forever.

54
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:57,826
I'm in PE too.

55
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:59,536
I made room
in my trophy case.

56
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,663
Then, I remembered
classes don't
give out trophies,

57
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,041
so I put a fishbowl
there instead.

58
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:05,709
It's been quite
the week.

59
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:07,878
So, the rest of us
will have to pick up
the slack,

60
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,714
and, yes, Jeffrey,
I assume you're out,

61
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:13,050
because of
your track record
of literally being

62
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:14,259
too cool for school.

63
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,678
Actually, you can
count me in on this one.

64
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,888
What?
(ALL REACT)

65
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,807
You had me at
"no Pierce."

66
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,183
He's been all over me
lately to hang out.
It's weird.

67
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,478
You just want to be
a part of something.

68
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:28,107
Admit it,
Thanksgiving softened
that Winger underbelly.

69
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,942
Ugh, Britta.

70
00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:33,153
Now, let's set sail
and hunt that whale!

71
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,322
Yeah.
Hey, let's do that.

72
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,490
Oh!

73
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,117
You know
what the commercial says.

74
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,328
"Keep your damn hands
off my Let's."

81
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:11,775
Hey, Jeff,
there you are.

82
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:14,319
I was thinking
we could swing by
this great barbershop I know.

83
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,863
You're looking
a little stubbly,

84
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,197
and nobody handles a razor
like an Italian.

85
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,077
They develop nimble fingers
from pleasing
their mistresses.

86
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:24,997
Thank you for
opening my eyes
to two new stereotypes.

87
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,832
Now, how can
I put this?

88
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,876
No.
I don't want to go.

89
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,795
Not now, not ever.
No.

90
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,049
No prob.

91
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,842
We'll work
around your skedge.

92
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:38,385
Ah.

93
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,095
It's okay.
Pierce is gone.
ALL: Yes.

94
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,304
Walking dead
has left the building.

95
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,514
Resume operation,
deadliest catch.

96
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,558
Archie is gonna love
this banner.

97
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,560
The name,
brand glitter
really shows.

98
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:47,853
Yo, yo, yo.

99
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,271
School board guys
in the hizzie!

100
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,524
Richie, Richie,
pace yourself.

101
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,650
Hey, there, Dean.

102
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,110
Just thought
we'd pop in

103
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,528
and check
on the big whale hunt.

104
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,239
Ah, what a day we have
planned for young Archie.

105
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,367
Library tour,
calculator
lab demonstration...

106
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,078
And,
it all culminates

107
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,371
in the
"spirit of Greendale"
reception.

108
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,082
Magnitude
is a soft yes.

109
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:09,499
Oh, wow,
that's a get.

110
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,002
As much as we love
that Magnitude,

111
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:14,588
your tour may be
lacking a little...

112
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,006
Tour sucks, bro.

113
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:18,299
What?
You gotta think big.

114
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:21,803
Hookers, blow,
hookers.

115
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,097
He's been mixing,

116
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,015
but there is
some wisdom there.

117
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:26,641
We need
this whale money.

118
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,560
The kid
likes snowboarding.

119
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:32,814
Maybe Shaun White
finds his way
on the faculty roster.

120
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:33,941
He likes to party.

121
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,443
Maybe Greendale
suddenly has a frat.

122
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,570
The Delta Cubes,
or whatever.

123
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,072
Dean, you're not
considering this, are you?

124
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:42,074
No, no.
Greendale stands
on its own.

125
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:43,366
No hookers,
no blow,

126
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,202
no Shaun White frat.

127
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:46,954
College dean
threatening a fraternity.

128
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,250
You'll never shut down
the Delta Cubes.

129
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,002
What?
Delta Cubes,
Delta Cubes, Delta Cubes...

130
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:56,130
Look,
it's your call, Craig.

131
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,715
Don't let this whale
swim away.

132
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:01,969
Cruise by
Skeeper's Express
for a refill?

133
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,303
I'll second that motion.

134
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,514
(SIGHS)

135
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,225
I've been working
on my victory dances.

136
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:10,769
Basketball,
football,

137
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,980
and crab soccer.

138
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,106
That one's the hard one.

139
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:16,108
Well, that's nice.

140
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,943
Hey, when I was
in grade school,

141
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:21,738
PE was about
being picked on
and picked last,

142
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,991
but, you'll put me
on your team, right?

143
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,243
Right, but also, wrong.
Ah.

144
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:27,911
PE's about
survival of the fittest.

145
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:29,412
(BLOWS WHISTLE)
Line up, class.

146
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,668
Welcome to PEE
I'm Coach Jason Chapman.

147
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,628
Physical education
education?

148
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,922
I thought that was a typo
in the course cartalogue.

149
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,465
It started as a typo,

150
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,009
but it's grown
into one of Greendale's

151
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,969
most successful programs.

152
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,595
Anyone can take PE.

153
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,931
I teach my student coaches
to teach PE.

154
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:50,184
(SCOFFS)

155
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:51,226
Something funny,
Coach Barnes?

156
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,978
No, it's just...

157
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,729
You're teaching us
how to be gym teachers.

158
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,023
Gym teachers?

159
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,441
A gym
is a building,

160
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,902
a man-made structure
inside which

161
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,737
Physical Education
teachers

162
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,907
teach Physical Education
to Physical
Education students.

163
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,159
Pop quiz,
Coach Barnes,

164
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:09,244
a student is choking
on a plastic golf ball.

165
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:10,453
What do you do?
I...

166
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,164
How many
orange cones
does it take

167
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:13,915
to line
a regulation soccer field?

168
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,335
What if students
are talking
during stretches?

169
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,419
When my kids
talk past bedtime,

170
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,421
I use my angry voice,
and I say,

171
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,132
"The next peep I hear
will be the last."

172
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:24,051
And I give 'em
one of these.

173
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,384
Not bad,
Coach Bennett.

174
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:26,887

00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:07,897
and they always give me
free stuff,

522
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:09,690
like that jet ski
I sunk,

523
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:11,233
but it would be
pretty sweet

524
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,860
to be treated
like a normal dude...

525
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,487
(LAUGHS)
So I'm in.

526
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,822
(SIGHS)

527
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:18,407
Magnitude.

528
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:20,200
You usually
have the perfect blend

529
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:24,204
of brevity and wit
that sums up
situations like this.

530
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:26,040
Pop pop!

531
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,207
Yay!

532
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,793
Oh, that's so good!

533
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,128
So good!

534
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,504
I think
we all learned today

535
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:34,632
that all human beings
deserve dignity.

536
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:35,758

00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,183
Delta Cubes,

540
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,267
Slack attack?

541
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,268
Ah!

542
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,480
ALL: Delta Cubes!
Delta Cubes!

543
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,190
Mark my words,
Delta Cubes,

544
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:53,192
you'll pay for this!

545
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:55,486

547
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,120
Is this seat taken?

548
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:05,830
Free country.

I was thinking

551
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,007
I might start coming here
more often.

552
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,635
I like the vibe.

553
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,516
You know what sport
I never got?

554
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:26,726
Golf.

555
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,063
No argument here.

556
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:32,272
They lost me immediately
with the clown clothes.

557
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,316
You know,
I belong to a dozen
country clubs.

558
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,651
Never played.

559
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,695
I just spend my time
hitting on the waitresses.

560
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,947
There's something
about a country club
waitress

561
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,241
that just makes you wanna
pay your dues every year.

Honestly, after all that,
you still eat Splingles?

572
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,227
Uh, yeah, Troy.

573
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,311
Splingles
have 30% less fat.

574

They're the fit chip.

go home.
