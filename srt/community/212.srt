Everyone have a good break?

00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:14,556
I discovered a new muscle
to work out.

9
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:17,100
Ladies, you'll thank me
come tank-top season.

10
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,936
I checked all of
Pierce's wardrobes

11
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:20,855
for portals
to magical worlds.

12
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:22,230

was something called

I joined a group
that cleans the city.

We picked up litter
and dredged the river.

Is it the Russian guy

an immediate answer,

Yes, you heard me right,
I have stopped drinking,

118
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,115
mainly due to the fact

119
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:42,741
that I could no longer
get an erection.

120

you can expect both this class
and my penis

00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,998
Why wouldn't he?
He is so sweet.

00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,582
Yeah, sweet and wise.

142
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,709
He has lived
such a long, full life.

143
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,129
How old is he again?
Thirty-something.

144
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:39,298
He has a landline
and uses the word "album."

145
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:41,382
You don't think
he's too old for me?

146
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:44,303
No.
No, come on, by that logic,

147
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:46,638
I wouldn't have a shot
with anybody at this table.

This class is about to
get really hard.

151
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,605
I have an idea about that.
Rich is really smart

152
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,398
and he knows a lot
about anthropology.

153
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,859
If we start
studying with him,

154
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,111
it could help a lot,
plus, you know...

155
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:04,363
Heh-heh.
Oh, you know what, though?

156
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:06,116
I just realized.

157
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:08,785

right?

you're always talking about

for someone old enough

to find your racism subversive.

162

163
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:21,673
There's a process.
It takes time.

164
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:24,383
Well, then I say
we gather all the candidates

165
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:26,803
and make an informed,
democratic decision.

about two more good years.
