1
00:00:01,251 --> 00:00:03,170
So according
to the demonologist,

2
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:05,046
the gymnasium is clean.

3
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:07,299
Jeez, we're running out
of to-do stars.

4
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:08,467
Already dealt with.

5
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:10,302
JEFF: It's hard to believe.

6
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,262
Somewhere along the way,
we started turning
this school around.

7
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:13,555
Huh.

8
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:15,015
Hmm.
Huh.

9
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:18,519
What the hell was that?
What was what?

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,270
That long, quiet lull.
I don't like it.

11
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:22,314
It's called contentment,
dude.

12
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,649
Exactly. We're never content.
Someone's always got to
have a problem.

13
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:25,066
I've got a problem.

14
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,652
I don't like Abed's problem
with our lack of problems.

15
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:28,403
Ooh.
Oh. Ah, okay.

16
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:29,780
(LAUGHING)

17
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:31,198
I commented on his commentary.

18
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,408
I just drew a circle
around Abed, baby.

19
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,910
(SWEET VOICE)
I don't think it's nice

20
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:37,329
to pigeonhole
people's gimmicks.

21
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,289
(DEEP VOICE)
You hear me, two voice?

22
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:42,292
Abed, let us have a moment
of peace and stillness.

23
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:44,085
They're kind of rare
around here.

24
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,671
All I'm saying is,
calm before the storm.

25
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,172
Says the storm generator.

26
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,383
All right, fine.
Let's be content.

27
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,593
Hmm. Hmm.

There's an insurance
appraiser coming tomorrow.

Your ass
is getting appraised

51
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:53,739
insurance-style.

53
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,575
What does that mean?

54
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:59,036
We hope it means
we find out that
your school

55
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:01,162
is very, very valuable
to the city.

56
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,123
Hey,
how hilarious would that be?

57
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:04,374

00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,751
Are you guys drunk?

59
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:07,461
Good luck proving it
before we're not.

60
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,879
Yeah.

61
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:10,213

00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:22,601
So what?

69
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,645
I made all the vegetables
disappear.

70
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,981
Usually, a lot more than this
happens in 30 minutes
is all I'm saying.

71
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:28,649
We're just relaxed and happy.

72
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,818
I care more about this
than anything I've ever
cared about.

73
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,987
Best $199 I've ever spent.

74
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:34,738
It's three dollars.

What are you playing?

76
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:40,327
That's control software
for some kind of
irrigation equipment.

00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,122
It's fun.

Save Greendale committee,
unite.

79
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,751
Boom.
An insurance appraiser
is coming tomorrow

80
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:50,253
to inspect the school,
and if he doesn't
appraise us good,

81
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,131
the school is doomed,
doomed.

82
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:53,924
Call to adventure.
Call to adventure.

83
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:55,634
What's an insurance appraiser?

84
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,385
Something that sounds
normal and boring

85
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,681
but is actually scary,
like a raised mole
or a turkey deep fryer.

86
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,142
There's only one man
qualified to appraise
insurance,

87
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:05,184
and he died 2,000 years ago
on a cross.

88
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:08,229
I've seen
insurance appraisers bleed.

89
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:11,274
Their blood's different,
darker.

90
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,360
Everyone, take a breath.

91
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:16,530
You're overreacting
because this school
is addicted to crisis.

92
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,406
They're like one
of those hurricane
Katrina dogs

93
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,450
that won't let anyone
pet them anymore.

94
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:23,996
JEFF: But the weird thing
we need to get used to
is this:

95
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:25,413
The school's in decent shape.

96
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,457
This doesn't have to be
a big deal.

97
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:29,710
I wrote a paper
on those dogs.

98
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:36,424
We've worked hard all semester
to save this school.

99
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,011
Truth is, we did.

100
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:40,804
So relax.

101
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,890
Are you sure, Jeffrey?
I promise.

102
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,641
Jeff's heart is in
the right place,
but he's wrong.

103
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:47,853
Greendale is a crazy place
where crazy things happen.
I have a plan.

104
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,980
We'll pretend our school
has a world renowned
physics department.

105
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:50,981
Dean,
start learning Swedish.

106
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:53,025
I'll do my best!

107
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:54,693
Hickey, do you keep in touch
with any unstable criminals
that you busted?

108
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,195
Mmm, five.

109
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,905
Get them down here
for costume measurements.

110
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,074
Annie, we need to make
a particle accelerator
out of Kleenex boxes.

111
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:01,742
Nope.
Nobody do any of that.

112
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,952
Abed, outside.

113
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,248
There is no story.

114
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,917
Everything's a story, Jeff.
Getting out of bed is a story.

115
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,334
Certainly this is a story.

116
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,711
I mean, start with
the study room.
We're content.

117
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,546
I'm concerned.
Skip the fruit-matching stuff.

118
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,673
Dean enters with
the insurance appraiser story,

119
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,133
call, refusal.

120
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,885
You're literally dragging me
across a threshold

121
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,595
demanding there be no story,
which puts me

122
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,097
into a whole new world
that I'm gonna have to
adapt to.

123
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,306
Well, you have to do it
by yourself, please.

124
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,601
Okay?
Because if this appraisal
is a story,

125
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:30,604
that means we're in trouble,
and we are not in trouble,

126
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,023
because if we are...

127
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:34,315
No more stories.

128
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,901
Tada.

129
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:38,779
So we'll see you later.

130
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,239
After no story.

131
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,823
No story.

132
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,368
So be it.

133
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,287
Let the lack of story...

134
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,042
(SLURPING)

135
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,308
Hey.

136
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:10,310
Oh, put one trap
behind each cabinet.

137
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,520
Although
I think we're good.

138
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,439
The cafeteria food killed
most of the roaches anyway.

139
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,817
JEFF: Hey, check it out.

140
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,026
Is this a wedding ring?

141
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,027
PELTON: Are you kidding?

142
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,487
What...

143
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,114
Aw...

144
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:23,991
I lost this
my first week here.

145
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,243
Oh,
who's the lucky...

146
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,703
It's my mom's.

147
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,538
I started wearing it
because... I don't know.

148
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,332
Everybody dreams
of settling down, right?

149
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,044
And because it fits.

150
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,005
She had huge fingers
for a woman,

151
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,214
part of what killed her,
really.

152
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,550
I'm not dreaming
about settling down.

153
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,052
Well,
maybe you already have.

154
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,721
You're teaching,
and you like it.
You love Greendale.

155
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,474
No,
I love scotch and myself.

156
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,643
I tolerate Greendale.

157
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,062
It's a good school.
That's why there's no need
for this to get sentimental.

158
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,355
This inspection is going to be
the most boring thing

159
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,025
to happen here
since Britta dated Troy.

160
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:01,360
All right, no story.

161
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,362
Wait.

162
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,782
If there's no story,
what am I explaining?

163
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:08,285
I'm in a story.

164
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,162
Okay, think, Abed, think.

165
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,371
How do you shake a story?

166
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:16,043
The answer

167
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,919
is in the teacher's lounge.

168
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,971
(DRAMATIC MUSIC)

169
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,142
Here he comes,
here he comes.
Okay.

170
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,645
Hi, there.
My name is Ronald Mohammed.

171
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,105
Go ahead.
I've heard them all.

172
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,899
RONALD: The city of Greendale
has sent me here

173
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,194
to assess this campus' level
of liability.

174
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:44,196
Now,
what do I mean by liability?

175
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,989
Well, the city
