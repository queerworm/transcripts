178
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,435
Britta. What are
you doing here?

179
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,604
Oh, I was just
getting some air.

180
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,814
Me too.
And wondering something.

181
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,149
I was wondering
something, too.

182
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,360
Tell me.
No, you first.

183
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,987
BOTH:
I was wondering, what would it
be like if we were partners?

184
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,322
What's going on here?

185
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:28,865
Were you thinking
of changing partners?

186
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,491
Who's thinking
of changing partners?

187
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,327
Were you gonna bail on me?

188
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,913
No. No one here is thinking of
changing partners. No, sir.

189
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,456
I am!

190
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,293
While he was spying,
I found a turtle.

191
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,669
It's not fair that
I should be the only one here

192
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,923
saddled with a total
waste of space loser.

193
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,008
No offense, Todd.
None taken.

194
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,886
Why should you all get
the exact partner you wanted?

195
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,805
That's right.

196
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,099
It's totally not fair that
we saddled Pierce with Todd.

197
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:56,726
We should probably choose again.
I mean, just to be fair.

198
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,062
So it's agreed.
Let's go to the study room

199
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,981
and deal with this Todd
problem once and for all.

200
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,191
Okay.

201
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,692
Um, did you want me to come?

202
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,362
Um, it's called
"the Todd problem."

203
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:19,791
Okay, we just have to
come up with a fair way

204
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:23,795
to decide who is gonna be
stuck for an entire semester

205
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:26,881
with this...random.

206
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,301
This, uh...non-grouper.

207
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:31,052
No offense, Todd.
None taken.

208
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,595
I'm happy to work
with whoever.

209
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,140
There's only one way
to decide this fairly.

210
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,933
We go boy-girl, boy-girl.

211
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,560
But everyone has to have
a different hair color.

212
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,104
And be from
a different high school.

213
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,357
And be a different race.

214
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:45,442
I guess I'd be with...Britta.

215
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,152
I guess my hands are tied.

216
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,945
The hair color
concept intrigues me

217
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,697
because it's how
I distinguish you anyway.

218
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,449
But what if we
arrange by age,

219
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,909
so the young people can work
while the old people sleep.

220
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,828
Um, I was just wondering
who you considered old,

221
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,955
because I'd like
to remind you again

222
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,915
that I'm just about
the same age as Jeff.

223
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,459
I was counting Jeff as old too.
Hey!

224
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,127

That's all right then.

225
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,838

how my age has anything to--

[SNORING]
Oh, for heaven's sake, Pierce!

227
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,468
I was thinking the thing that
would be most beneficial--

228
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,220
You know, for the group.
--would be to

229
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,889
pair the people with the
lowest GPAs with the highest.

230
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,349
Hmm. Interesting.

231
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:19,434

carrying the lowest?

232
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:21,228

you might want that.

00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,814

Wait, no.
Pew, pew, pew-- Wait.

00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:33,448

newborn that I'd like to get--

00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,992
Oh, perfect! You'll enjoy
talking to Shirley about kids.

pawn Todd off on me.
