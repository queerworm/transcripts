(DRAMATIC MUSIC)

2
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:21,146
My name is Kevin,
or so they tell me.

3
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:24,065
Actually, they told me
my birth name
is Benjamin Chang,

4
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:27,903
but I can't remember anything
before six months ago.

5
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,530
But by using
a special, shiny glass

6
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,532
called a mirror,

7
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,993
I've estimated
that I'm 15 years old,

8
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,829
although I have no way
of knowing.

9
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:39,581
Changnesia is a fascinating
and extremely rare disease

10
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:42,125
on the forefront
of the psychological
landscape.

11
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,545
DR. KEDAN: <i> Compared with your</i>
<i>garden variety amnesia,</i>

12
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:47,255
<i>Changnesia is immeasurably</i>
<i>more complex.</i>

13
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:52,386
<i>Its varied</i>
<i>and seemingly</i>
<i>random symptoms,</i>

14
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:55,514
<i>its resistance</i>
<i>to both traditional</i>
<i>and new age medicine,</i>

15
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:58,017
<i>why Changnesia</i>
<i>affects the memory</i>

16
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,101
<i>but not the ability</i>
<i>to make forced puns...</i>

17
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,353
These are all things
we can study

18
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,355
now that someone
finally has it.

19
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:04,648
I first met Chang
when I hired him

20
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,567
as a Spanish teacher
at Greendale.

21
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:09,570
Then he became
a disgraced student,

22
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,488
psychopathic music major,

23
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,740
homeless vent dweller,

24
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:13,908
security guard,
keytarist,

25
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,034
power hungry warlord,

26
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,785
and now, Kevin.

27
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:18,161
It's sad
to see him like this.

28
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,246
Well, it's mixed.

29
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:20,956
He was pretty terrible
before.

30
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:23,876
I'm developing a theory
which some find controversial.

31
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:26,003
Perhaps Chang
actually used to be Kevin,

32
00:01:26,045 --> 00:01:27,838
went crazy,
and became Chang.

33
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,214
And then,
at some point,

34
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,717
Chang hit his head,
went un-crazy,

35
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,054
thereby reverting back
to regular old Kevin again.

36
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:36,304
DR. KEDAN:
That makes no sense.

37
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,933
Science tells us

38
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:41,142
hitting his head
would only cure him

39
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,520
if hitting his head
was the original cause.

40
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:45,188
Told you
it was controversial.

41
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,315
Here at Greendale,
we accept all students,

42
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:50,235
whoever they may be
or have forgotten they were.

43
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:51,820
But assisting
in Kevin's recovery

44
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:54,031
has put a financial strain
on the school.

45
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:56,199
That's why
we are appealing

46
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,868
<i>to the MacGuffin</i>
<i>Neurological Institute</i>

47
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,536
<i>for this $40,000 grant,</i>

48
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:03,082
so we can continue
to fight
this terrible disease

49
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,626
and hopefully, one day,
pay for this documentary.

50
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,379
How was that, Abed?
That's too beggy?

51
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:10,881
ABED:
No, that was great.

52
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:13,092
But I could use
a new camera,
with a smoother zoom.

53
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,886
Oh, okay.
Well, just be sure
to get my good side, okay?

54
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:17,763
This documentary
needs to be convincing.

55
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:21,391
This needs to be
the <i> Hoop Dreams</i>
of things people care about.

56

57
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,105
The dean
wants a propaganda film,

58
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,941
but I intend to explore
all sides
of this serious issue,

59
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:30,901
including those who don't
think it's a serious issue.

60
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,694
Hey, Jeff.

61
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:33,862
What are you doing?

62
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,322
Making a documentary
on Changnesia.

63
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,531
You gotta be
(BLEEP) kidding me.

64
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,866
ABED: Got it.
Beautiful.

65
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,743
All right,
let's get one more

66

The history

What's the
MacGuffin Institute?

82
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,375
PIERCE: Fine.
I'll tell him.

83
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,920
But one day,
you'll all be old and slow
and lose at things,

84
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:33,338
and when that day comes,

85
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,924
I won't remember
what I'm doing now.

86
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:38,635
Lord, the MacGuffin Institute
is coming to Greendale
on Friday

87
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:42,263
because they might
give the school money
to study Changnesia.

88
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:45,100
Changnesia isn't a disease.
It's a con.

89
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,144
You're seriously
helping this lunatic?

90
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:48,854
He kept the dean
in a dungeon.

91
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,147
He tried
to kill us.

92
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:51,940
He ate his twin
in utero.

93
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,026
That was Chang.
This is Kevin.

94
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:55,944
They're the same idiot.

95
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,946
How would you know?
Have you ever even
spent any time with him, Jeff?

96
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:00,699
I was reluctant
to accept Kevin
at first, too,

97
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:04,161
but he's just so sweet.

98
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:06,080
The world is
brand new to him.

99
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,748
He approaches everything
with the wonderment

100
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,125
of a small child
or a cartoon alien.

101
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,334
Whoa.

102
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,461
This makes
things smaller.

103
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,255
No, no...
Bigger.

104
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,298
Oh, bigger.

105
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,676
Well, enjoy
your collective delusion.

The whole thing.
Okay, put it together
for me.

113
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,690

All right, thanks, buddy.

You don't seriously think
Chang is Kevin, do you?

117
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,782
No, I believe the good Lord
made Chang Chang.
Kevin is a choice.

Thank you.
I'm seriously worried
about the rest of the group.

they're in

get to work.

No, Shirley,
you've got to
help me stop this.

Hmm?

The customers
love Kevin.

130
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:03,804
I think it's because
he's a good listener.

131
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,347
Most words are new to him,
so it's all
still fascinating.

a second chance.

It doesn't mean I forgot.
I just forgave.

Why does everyone
keep forgetting
about that?

00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:35,294
But he didn't.
And you used
to be a sleazy lawyer.

gave you a second chance?

a completely

181
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:45,322

to find out

what happened to Kevin before
he showed up at Greendale.

193

What hellish experiences
did he overcome
during those missing months?

194

Do you think you can
use your forensic knowhow
to do some investigating?

195
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,142

Obvi.

196
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,560
Can I help?

197
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,187

The postman
found Kevin here.

203
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:30,200
He said he was soaking wet
and smelled like fish.

204
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:31,285
I know it's not a lot
to go on...

205
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,536
Um, it's almost
too much to go on.

230

You said,
"You hired Chang?"

231

And I said,
"I'm Kevin,
and you are?"

00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,050
And you said,
"Not calling you Kevin,"

00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,302
and I said,
"Hi, not calling you Kevin.
What are you having?"

234
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,012
And you said,
"None of this."

235
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,472
And then Shirley said,
"I don't care
what he calls himself.

236
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,056
"He's a hard worker.

237
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,516
"We're all broken people,

deserve a second chance.

a second chance.

239
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,395
"Doesn't mean I forgot.
I just forgave."

240
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,230
And you said,
"Chang didn't sleep
with a stripper.

241

"He tried
to kill us.

242
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,317
"Why does everyone keep
forgetting all that?"

243
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,402

to be a sleazy lawyer."

Changnesia's hard
to understand.

535

At least, that's what
people tell me.

536
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,817
Now, I don't know
a thing about it,

537
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,777
which apparently
is one of the symptoms,

538
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,153
and it's so frustrating.

539
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:20,409
Look, I know Chang
was a bad guy.

540
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:24,246
So he probably deserved
everything you did to him.

541
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,957
But you're not a bad guy.

542
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,458
You just made a mistake.

543
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:31,170

to start over fresh
if you are.

547
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,556
But I have got an idea
of what it feels like

548
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,433
to be Chang.

549

that name behind

anyone can make.
