00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:04,171
And Andre's
going as Han Solo.

2
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:05,255
Oh!

3
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:06,340
The boys
are storm troopers

4
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:07,382
and little baby Ben
is an Ewok.

5
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,343
Oh!
Oh!

6
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:10,845
Aw, you don't
have enough children.

7
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:12,596
Happy Halloween parties,
everyone.

8
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:13,597
You all look great...

00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,265
Ham.
Pig.

10
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:16,350
Let me guess.

11
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,268
You're a flimsy excuse
to be shirtless,

12
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,394
wearing silk underwear.

13
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:21,689
And you are
as wrong
as you are welcome.

14
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:22,898
Now, this year,
I planned

15
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,566
a two person costume
with Annie.

16
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:25,818
She's going
as my ring girl.

Pretty freakydeaky, huh?

20
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:34,201
Annie, no.
I meant the boxing match
ring girl.

21
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,077
They're the sexy ones
that hold the round numbers.

22
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,579
Yeah, see?

23
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:40,207
This is why
we can't just text
about it, Jeff.

24
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:41,375
I don't watch sports.

25
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,918
But there's no boxer
in <i> The Ring.</i>

26
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,712
Yeah, well,
I don't watch
scary movies.

27
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,463
And that's why
we leave

28
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:50,300
the couples' costumes
to the couples,
she said wisely.

29
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:52,177
You should probably warn
your boyfriend's boyfriend.

30
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,428
Just because
we're dating

31
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,014
doesn't mean
that we have to do
everything together.

32
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,598
Well, you need to do
some things together.

33
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,642
We do some things.

34
00:00:58,684 --> 00:00:59,894
We do a lot of things.

35
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:01,896
(GASPS)
Not all the things.

36
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,272
Things.

37
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,149
Okay, so, we're all here...

to Vicki's party

for reasons
beyond our control
or concern.

40

through his face.

42
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,659
Does Vicki have a TV?
Abed, it's a party.

43
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:17,411
You're not watching TV.
No, I'll be
watching <i> Annie.</i>

44
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,579
She started watching
<i>Cougar Town</i> reruns,

45
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,163
which makes <i> Annie</i>
my third favorite show,

46
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,874
and tonight
is their
Hallowine special.

47
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:24,919
Ooh, that's right.
Better not
miss the merlot.

Clink!

49
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:27,629
What? You fall into it.

50
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,088
That was Pierce.

51
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,340
He accidentally
locked himself
in his panic room

52
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:31,466
and he needs our help.

53
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,218
ALL: Oh!
No, "Oh!"

54
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,094
"Oh" means we are going
against our will,

55
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:36,847
and we are not going.
He's lying.

56
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:38,473
He seemed pretty upset,

57
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,516
and he's been all alone
up there in that mansion

58
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:41,018
ever since I moved out,

59
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,937
and his dad,
you know,

60
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:44,438
got killed by Jeff.

61
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,525
Hmm, calling for help.
A classic call for help.

62
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:51,278
Hello, Dr. Perry's office.
Damaged psyche?

63
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,863
Yes,
I'll accept the charges.

66
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:58,786
Maybe we should just
stop by on our way
to the party.

67
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:02,289
I assure you,
the only thing Pierce
is trapped in is adolescence.

68
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,749
He is
a geriatric toddler,

69
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,126
throwing the most
elaborate tantrums
money can buy,

70
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,545
and I, for one,
am not gonna stand by

71
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:10,839
and allow some lonely,
ridiculous person

72
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,424
to derail
our group's plans.

73
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:16,053
Ding, ding, ding!

Ah, the only thing spooky
about this place

88
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,727
is the tacky decor.

89
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:08,229

threw up <i> Miami Vice.</i>

So tacky.

I don't know.
Maybe Pierce
isn't doing so well

93
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,696
since he lost his father
and then his inheritance

94
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,238
in a video game battle
with Gilbert,

he never knew he had.

and just skip to the catch.

344
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,199
Pierce spent his whole,
pathetic life

345
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:24,369
begging for scraps
of his father's approval.
I moved on.

346
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,246
Maybe Pierce
needs a dad.
I don't.

347
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,788
Don't you?
Stop that!

348
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,541
Okay,
if I need a dad
so bad,

349
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,419
how come I've had
his phone number
for three weeks

350
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,629
without
the slightest urge
to call him?

351
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:37,131
You found your dad?

00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:39,300

We have no Abed,

377
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,372
Pierce sent us
on a wild goose chase.

378

Jeff was right.
I am naive.

Oh,
don't listen to him.

380
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,044
There's nothing naive
about helping
a friend in need.

Jeff would know that
if he wasn't too cool

loop back
to the indoor swing room.

asked someone

to help you
with your stupid prank
and then forgot.

was a hard no.

one explanation.

I belittled my father's
good name for a prank,

467
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,945
and his ghost has returned
to scold me

468

butcher you guys
for going along with it.

in this room

ask yourself,

475
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:27,087
is the real threat
out there

Well, technically,
it's my house.

487
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:52,238
After our father died,

488
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,156
I became
the sole inheritor
of his estate,

489
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,701
including all six houses
and the decommissioned
submarine.

490
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,118
What?
What?

491
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,120
So you came here
to kick me out?

492
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,956
Actually, I came here
to give you the deed,

493
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:04,124
but on the day
of my arrival,
you were out.

494
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,960
I noticed mail piled up
by the door.

495
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:07,921
I took it in,
paid the overdue bills,

496
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:10,339
replaced a few
light bulbs,
and, well,

497
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,008
that was six weeks ago.

498
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,301
So you've been living here
in secret this whole time?

499
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,387
Yes.
I'm ashamed to say

500
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,640
that after a lifetime
as Cornelius's assistant,

501
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:22,393
I've had a difficult time
adjusting to his passing.

502
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,562
It seems his absence
has taken a greater toll

503
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,272
than his presence
ever did.

504
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:28,649

purpose again,

I've been discovered
by your thin friend,

506

and bid you <i> adieu.</i>

Look, I've been doing
really well
since Dad died,

511
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,086
so I don't need anyone
taking care of me,

512
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,837
but if you're having
a tough time...

anything else, brother?

00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,930
Yes. Bring it in.

00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,650
Tell Vicki I say
Happy Halloween.
That'll mess with her.

520
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:11,818
You sure
you don't want to come?

521
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,235
I've got a mask
for you to wear.

522
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,570
One that doesn't zip
at the mouth.

523
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:16,072
No, thanks.

524
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:17,531
I'll hang around here
with Gilbert.

525
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,199
He needs me.

526
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,952
Oh, that's nice.

527
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:22,536
What was all that
about masks?

528
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,621
Don't know,
don't want to.

529
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,123
Fair enough.

530
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,126
Hey, how about you and I
skip out on this party?

531
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,961
Why? To do what
and where?

532
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:32,797
Oh, I was thinking
you could show me
some <i> Inspector Spacetime.</i>

533
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:33,923
You're always
talking about it.

534
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:35,091
I've never seen
a full episode.

535
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:37,927
Oh, are you sure
you want to?

536
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:40,138
It starts pretty slow.
The first inspector
couldn't even time travel.

537
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,472
Uh!
That sounds fine.

538
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,223
After a night
of running in circles,

539
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,934
trying to untie
Winger knots,

540
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:46,477
I'm looking
for something slow.

541
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:54,027
Sorry I ruined
your night.

542
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:56,029
Actually,
Pierce ruined my night,

543
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,113
but you were right
to let him.

544
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:58,447
You still want to go
to the party?

545
00:19:58,489 --> 00:19:59,907
I heard Vicki
bought dry ice

546
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:01,868
and gave Leonard
the wrong address.

547
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,953
Uh, I'll take a pass.
Oh.

548
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:06,205
I have some
unfinished business
at home.

549
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,209
(MELLOW POP MUSIC)

550
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,459
Troy!

551
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:55,254
Are you in here?

552
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,132
Abed, was that you?

553
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:01,260
I want to show you something
on the other side
of the bookcase.

554
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:04,638
Troy?

555
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,265
Find me
as soon as you can.

556
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,436
Who is in my house?

557
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,022
Gilbert!

558
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:14,815
Hijinks.

559
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,946
Indubitably.

560
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,198
Did it work?
Are you tall?
