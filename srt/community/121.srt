00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:42,443
ABED:
<i>At Greendale, they were always</i>
<i>out of chicken fingers.</i>

173
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:44,445
<i>So whoever could get them</i>
<i>had power.</i>

174
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:47,199
<i>I the guy was in the apron,</i>
<i>so I came up with a system.</i>

175
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,492
<i>Pretty soon half the chicken</i>
<i>at Greendale</i>

176
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,912
<i>was going out the side door.</i>

177
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,788
<i>Everybody in our crew</i>
<i>had a job.</i>

178
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,123
<i>T-Bone was the bag man.</i>

179
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,000
<i>He'd move the fingers</i>
<i>to a storeroom</i>

180
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,752
<i>where two girls</i>
<i>did the packaging.</i>

181
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,921
<i>We could trust them</i>
<i>not to eat the supply</i>

182
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,881
<i>because Britta</i>
<i>was a vegetarian.</i>

183
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:05,800
<i>And Shirley figured that if</i>
<i>she stole, she'd go to hell.</i>

184
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,136
<i>They'd hand the stuff</i>
<i>out the window to Annie.</i>

185
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,389
<i>She was the leg man,</i>
<i>the distributor.</i>

186
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,017
<i>The crazy thing was,</i>
<i>it was their food.</i>

187
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,519
<i>And we were stealing it</i>
<i>and giving it back to them</i>

188
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,938
<i>like it was a big favor.</i>

189
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,689
<i>Nobody asked any questions,</i>

190
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,608
<i>because Pierce's experience</i>
<i>as a CEO</i>

191
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,361
<i>had taught him how to keep</i>
<i>the wheels from squeaking.</i>

192
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,154
<i>I had it all worked out</i>
<i>on a schedule.</i>

193
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,864
You know,
I've never been fired.

194
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,908
<i>The minute</i>
<i>you thought about busting us</i>

195
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:32,160
<i>was the minute</i>
<i>you had chicken in your hand.</i>

196
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,288
It's just insulting
that you're eating

197
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:36,415
his chicken fingers
in front of me.

198
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:39,500
<i>Everyone had their hand out.</i>
<i>Everyone wanted what we had.</i>

199
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,128
Oh. Well, here you go.

200
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,090
<i>And Jeff had the most</i>
<i>important job of all.</i>

201
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,467
<i>He was at the top.</i>
<i>He was the boss.</i>

202
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,344
<i>He was our leader.</i>

203
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:51,054
What the hell is going on?

204
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,472
AV kids hooked it up.

205
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,349
Abed supplied
the whole department

206
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:55,767
with chicken fingers.

207
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,894
You think that's good,
check out my posse

208
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,396
and Troy's monkey.

209
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:00,939
Troy, why do you have a monkey?

210
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:03,024
It's an animal
that looks like a dude.

211
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,401
Why don't I have
10 of them?

212
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:09,197
Guys, look at
what Abed scored for me.

213
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:13,285
It has a million zippers,
and it was free.

214
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,622
SHIRLEY:
Oh, robot.

215
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,873
I am a robot.

216
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,126
I am programmed
to love this backpack.

217
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,710
This is insane.

218
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,131
More insane than programming
them to replace auto workers?

219
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,841
What?

220
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:31,428
Okay, okay, if you're not
in this study group, please...

221
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:34,181
SHIRLEY: No, no.
That means you, sexy dreadlocks.

222
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,849
Britta's hairdresser.
What?

223
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,725
Pierce's hackneyed entourage.

224
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,353
Hackneyed?

225
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:40,979
You see the turban guy?
Yes...

226
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,731
in a '90s ski movie
that featured an entourage.

227
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,942
Don't you think
this is getting out of hand?

228
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,736
We won't get caught. We have
campus security on the take.

229
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,905
Abed's got it all figured out.

230
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,325
Well, that's a relief.
Yeah, it's pretty cool

231
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:55,576
being friends with
the biggest man on campus.

232
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,745
Isn't that right,
Annie's Boobs?

233
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,414
Please rename that thing.

234
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,416
This time,
not with a contest on Twitter.

235
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,044
It's his Twitter account.
He can do what he wants.

236
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,670
They are my body parts.

237
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,423
Know what I don't appreciate?
I do not consent to this.

238
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,175
You'll be begging
for his company.

239
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:11,592
ANNIE:
I own that.

240
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,136
I wouldn't threaten a monkey.

241
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,638
They have more lactic acid
than us.

242
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,433
Shared my chicken with him.
Talk to the backpack.

243
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:22,270
TROY: You're the worst, Annie.
PIERCE: Streets ahead.

244
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:28,443
WOMAN:
Now, where's he going?
Uh, hello?

245
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,906
Line starts behind you.
Oh, he's cool.

246
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,782
WOMAN:
Six fingers every Wednesday.

247
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,659
ABED:
Cool. And what can you offer?

248
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,871
WOMAN:
I have a bicycle.
And I teach beginner's tennis.

249
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:41,331
ABED:
Cool, okay.

250
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:45,544
Six fingers Wednesdays,
all right.

251
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:46,961
We'll be in touch, Janel.

252
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,881
Thank you, Abed.
You're welcome.

253
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,841
Hey, Jeff.
Hey, buddy.

254
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,760
It's quite a setup
you got here.

255
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,054
Yeah,
I'm pretty excited about it.

256
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:59,516
It turns out everyone has needs
and everyone has functions.

257
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,518
Look, I've been thinking.

258
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,478
Maybe I need to hit
the big red button

259
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,772
and bring an end
to this operation.

260
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:09,150
I mean, it's been fun,
but it's out of control now.

261
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,693
Am I right?
I don't know.

262
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,029
The entire campus
is controlled by our group.

263
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,822
Our group is controlled
by chicken,

264
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,741
and the chicken is controlled
by me.

265
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,993
Float?
I'm good.

266
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,621
Abed,
the mafia movie is over.

267
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,956
I'm not doing a mafia movie.

268
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,958
I don't need to use
movies or TV shows

269
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,251
to talk to people anymore.

270
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,378
I needed them
because the day-to-day world

271
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,797
made no sense to me,
but now everyone's speaking

272
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,382
the same language:
chicken.

273
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,884
I understand people
and they understand me.

274
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:38,555
People are gonna get tired of
chicken. I'm tired of chicken.

275
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:42,809
You're not tired of chicken.
You miss the taste of control.

276
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,394
Well, that's crazy.

277
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,272
Is it?

278
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,526
The very thing that drove you

279
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:53,487
to this room
is what would prevent you

280
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,363
from properly running
this machine.

281
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,949
Or even being a cog in it,
your ego.

283
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,456
This has been about me
the whole time.

284
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:08,960
You want a shot
at the Jeff Winger throne?

285
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,838
You better bring
a powerful ass.

Oh, and for your information,
I don't have an ego.

You all have to stop working
for him.

296
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:43,620
Let this operation dry up
and let his wheels spin down.

297
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,581
At which point you would be
in charge again, right?

298
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,333
What?
BRITTA: This is so sad.

299
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,919
You're jealous of Abed
because he's providing for us.

300
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,006
I'm concerned about Abed because
he won't listen to reason.

00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:57,592
Won't listen to your reason.

Get me an entourage.
Get Troy a monkey.

That's what a real boss does.

308
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,690

be talking to him

Does that mean we shouldn't
listen to him either?

jackets for our crime family?
