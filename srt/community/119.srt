your flaws, Jeff?

Why are you letting
this guy get to you?

What's really going on?
I made a bad pot.

I always thought that
I was special and different.

And I guess I just have
a really hard time

Jeffrey,
when I was born,

362
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:49,073
I got my umbilical cord
wrapped around my neck,

363
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,991
both arms
and one of my ankles.

364
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:54,161
Mom said the doctors
stopped delivering me

365
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,247
and just started laughing.

366
00:15:56,247 --> 00:16:00,334
I mean, if I ever let being bad
at something stop me,

367
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,836
I wouldn't even be here.

call failure, I call living.

smoother since he drowned.
