I'm Annie's backpack.

Stop it, Troy.

12
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:50,718
Annie, say there are two friends
and they're in the same class,

13
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:53,345
and one of them wants to ask
the other one out on a date.

14
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:56,097
Like a grownup date,
but within biking distance

00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:58,851
of his parents' house.

16
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:00,895
Well, they could do
something on campus.

17
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:03,271
Tomorrow, there's a picnic
with live music

18
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,773
on the east lawn.

19
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:07,902
They're calling it
A Night Under The Stars.

20
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:11,071
Cool. I bet Randi would
love that type of thing.

21
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,074
Randi?
Oh, I thought--

22
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,368
Oh. You thought--

23
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:19,538
I can't believe I misled you
like that.

24
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:21,540
Listen...

25
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,626
Randi can be the name
of a guy or a girl.

26
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:27,504
And in this case,
it is definitely a girl.

27
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:30,382
Thanks for your help.

28
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:34,428
You're welcome.
And I hate you.

00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,304
And I wanna have
your children.

00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:38,891
Damn, I picked the wrong
couple to follow this morning.

31
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:40,935
Jeff and Britta are dead air.

00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:42,394
Are you okay?

33
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:44,939
It looks like you have actual
bed head this morning.

34
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,691
In fashion, I'm what's known
as a tastemaker.

35
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:50,027
And you missed an entire side
of your face shaving.

36
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:52,529

so will Gwen Stefani.

Oh, the guy with tiny nipples
you did it with.

Oh, God.
Hi, Vaughn.

42
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,414
Can we talk sometime?

43
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:04,249
I'm sorry
about how things ended.

44
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,043
Well, I'm sorry
I can't accept your apology

00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,711
because you're toxic,

You're like the exact opposite

Let me talk to him for you.

It'll be better

about our chubby thighs

The condo board's
trying to bluff me

by listing my place
as available.

120
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,579
But look at those faucets.

00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,372
Handcrafted in Italy.

What kind of offer is that?

00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,828
These are mint-condition issues.

is priceless.

anything more out of life

than cereal?

164
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,401
Sometimes I pour hot cocoa mix
into cold milk

165
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:24,069
and drink it like
a cold hot chocolate.

166
