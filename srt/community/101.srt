Good morning.

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,675
Many of you
are halfway through

3
00:00:07,675 --> 00:00:11,178
your first week here
at Greendale, and as your dean,

4
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:13,973
I thought I would share

5
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:16,558
a few thoughts of wisdom
and inspiration.

6
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,477
What is community college?

7
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:21,146
Well, you've heard
all kinds of things.

8
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:25,776
You've heard it's loser college
for remedial teens,

9
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:27,987
20-something dropouts,

10
00:00:27,987 --> 00:00:30,572
middle-aged divorcees,

11
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,574
and old people keeping
their minds active

12
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:35,494
as they circle
the drain of eternity.

13
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:37,621
That's what you've heard.

14
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:40,541
However, I wish you luck.

15
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:47,006
Okay, you know-- Uh-oh.

16
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:48,465

to this speech.

17
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,217
There's a middle card
that's missing.

18
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:51,886
Can we look around
our immediate areas?

19
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:53,345
Because I really wanted to--

20
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:55,556
I'm only half Arabic.
My dad is Palestinian.

21
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,933
He's a U.S. citizen, he's not
a threat to national security.

22
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:00,310
A lot of people wanna know that
because he has an angry energy.

23
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,437
But not angry at America,
angry at my mom for leaving.

24
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,939
She did leave
because he was angry

25
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,649
and he was angry
because she's American.

26
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:09,028
My name's Abed.
Abed, nice to know you

27

that I had?
Oh, uh--

she was borrowing a pencil.

But her name is Britta,
28, birthday in October.

35

Has two older brothers.
One works with children

I might look up.

37
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,425
She thinks she's gonna
flunk tomorrow's test.

38
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,595
She needs to focus. She's sorry
if that makes her seem cold.

less into integrity
