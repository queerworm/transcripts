Hot 'n' Brown's coffee
really wakes me up

3
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:13,973
to the fact
that its coffee sucks.

4
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,099
I miss having
a coffee shop.

5
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:19,060
Now where am I going
to get my cappuccinos
and Sarah McLachlan CDs?

6
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:21,313
It wasn't that great.
If had this space,

7
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,190
I would have
served fresh fruit
and sandwiches,

8
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:25,442
and I would've got rid
of that take-a-penny,
leave-a-penny nonsense.

9
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:27,361

to have a penny,
you'd have one.

like a wealthy murderer?

00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:33,492
I look like
an entrepreneur.

13
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:36,453
Now that my dad's gone,
I'm expanding

are the stuffed animals,

the men are
making them talk,

84

and they're not
drinking tea,

85
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,165
they're drinking
antiquated gender roles.

86

Somebody tell Britta
what an analogy is.

Look, I can't get behind
this marriage thing, either.

91
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:40,387
It was invented back
when "till death" meant
"till your first cold."

92

I mean, life's too long
to spend it with
someone else.

93
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,432
It's a sucker's game.
It's a mutual cop out.

94
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,685
I mean, just nut up
and die alone.

95
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:47,978

in two days,

and the wedding
is the day after that,
on our anniversary.

100
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,821

can make it,

101

because you're
already here.

in the study room?

103

certain policies

104

like second weddings,
and tight jeans and...

00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,084
Um, Jeff, I was wondering
if you would do us the honor

107
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,459
of giving a toast
at our wedding?

108
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,627
Good idea!

109
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,047
Jeff has a lot of thoughts
about marriage.

110
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:16,631
I would be honored.

111
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,466
Shirley, do you need
any help with your wedding?

112
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:19,843
This probably
sounds silly,

113
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:22,054
but every time I see
a wedding idea I like,

114
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:23,055
I put it in
a little scrapbook.

115
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:25,348
Oh, that's nice.
Ooh.

116
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,934
We can help too.
We just saw

the <i> Inspector Spacetime</i>
wedding episode,

118
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,104
so we know what pitfalls
to avoid.

119
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,813
Be sure to get a DNA reading
of your prospective mate.

120
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,899
Inspector Spacetime ended up
marrying himself as a baby.

00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,692

and gray shirts.

lay down on the sidewalk

(GRUNTS)

171
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:28,889
Shirley, my ninth-grade
English teacher used to say,

172
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,266
"There will always
be a reason not to
follow your dreams."

173
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,518
At the time, he meant
I was under the age
of consent.

174
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,896
But his words
still apply.

175
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,315
Are you sure your wedding
is the reason you're bailing

176
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:39,733
on this business
with Pierce?

177
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,985
Uh, in the words
of my ninth-grade
English teacher,

178
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,403
"You are dippin' and dappin'
and don't know
what's happenin'."

179
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,198
Fine, we both went
to public school.

180
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,991
It's just that
I don't want to
see you slide

181
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,576
into your old
comfort zone.

182
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:50,785
You don't know that.

183
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,663
I am gonna start
a business... Soon!

184
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:56,791
I can't help it if I have
floral arrangements to pick
and a DJ to hire...

185
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,668
Shirley, if that really
is your excuse,

186
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,419
I will plan
your wedding for you!

187
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,797

188
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,424
(LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY)

189
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,553
Ooh-hoo!
Thank you.

190
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,430
Oh, my good God.
Thank you for that.

191
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,016
I was serious.

192
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:17,979
Britta, you're not
planning my wedding.

193
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,981
What if Annie helps?
Oh, hey, guys.

194
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,442
Did someone say "Annie",
"help," "wedding,"

195
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,152
and something
about maybe hydrangeas?

196
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:27,030
Shirley,
you can lie to yourself,
but you can't lie to me.

197
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,448
Do not use
your second wedding

198
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,825
as an excuse
to limit yourself.

199
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:34,371
Pierce, come here.

200
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:37,457
Shirley, do you take this man
to be your business partner?

201
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,460
Mmm, I guess.
PIERCE: Sure.

202
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,545
I had to shelve
the Trouser Bench anyway.

203
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,214
There are still some parts
of the prototype

204
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:45,590
that need to
be extracted.

205
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,511
Maybe you're
misunderstanding?

206
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,472
I mean, from my butt.

207
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,058
Excuse me.

208
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,646
Meet Shirley.

209
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:02,607
She's modern, she's urban,
she's fun, and she's hungry.

210
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,610
You probably
notice she's black,
but not a stereotype...

211
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,946
Suburban black.
Is she suburban
or urban?

212
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,406
She's half-urban.

213
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:12,367
Let's say,
writer's secret,
bad pitch...

214
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,869
Her father's
a record producer,
her mother's a Shirelle.

215
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,289
We're supposed to be
preparing a business pitch.

216
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:18,706
What about
revenue projections?

217
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,334
What are the margins
gonna be?

Sweet, innocent Shirley.

221
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,842
What was the question?

222
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:32,220
Look, this was
Britta's stupid idea.

223
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,763
I'd rather be with my man,
planning my wedding,

224
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:37,392
and you'd clearly rather be
with Halle Berry in 1999.

225
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:38,852
Pleasure not doing business
with you.

226
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,897
Shirley,

228
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:50,197
They were just waiting
for my dad to be out
of the picture.

229
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,823
I'm not an entrepreneur.

230
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,533
I'm just a kid
with a bunch of money, I...

231
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,455
Please, please,
help me be somebody.

232
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:00,457
Let me invest in you.

233
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,466
First thing we need
to figure out
is our overhead.

234
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:11,385
Do you have a pen?
Yeah.

235
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:16,223
Oops. These pockets.

236
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,307
Do you know someone
that can buy a pen?

237
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:19,142
Yes!

238
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,728
Well, have you thought
about the color story
for your wedding?

239
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,063
He means
the theme of the wedding.

240
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,314
Right, Dale?
Mmm-hmm.

241
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:25,982
Same theme
as every wedding...

242
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,526
Conformity,
blind participation,
and patriarchal...

243
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,486
What about pink?
We don't call it pink.

244
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:30,820
We don't call anything
by its name.

245
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:33,073
That's, like,
day-one floral school stuff.

246
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,033
This is citrine.
This is opalescent.

247
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,452
This is sea glass, cameo,
and cerulean.

248
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,829
Come on,
how difficult is this?

249

one of these,

250
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,876
one of these, this one,

251
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,003
this one and, like,
stick a ribbon on it.
Happy?

252
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:52,759
Britta, that's a really
beautiful arrangement.

253
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,844
Color me lavender.

254
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,846
"Lavender"
means "impressed."

255
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,099
Yeah, well, great.
Flowers look good
in a pot.

we're dressed.

into something appropriate

and be on our way.

to believe, Jeff.

You once convinced Troy
that turtlenecks were
made of turtles' necks.

It's true,
my superpower is that
I can assume any position

as an option for myself,
down the road.

But I do have
a kryptonite.

283
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,863
It's so obvious to me
that marriage is dumb,

284

I can't even pretend
to get behind it.

I think would make
the perfect toast?

in your heart.

at this.

307

I know.
What's wrong with you?

308
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:04,974
This may shock you, Annie,
but I come from a long line
of wives and mothers.

309
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:07,977
Many do.
But I ran away from it
my whole life.

I refused to give Santa
a Christmas list,

311

to depend on any man
for anything.

very happy someday.

Well, yeah.

331
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,858
Uh, I had a drink,

332
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,776
and I looked
in my heart,

333
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,779
and here's what I got
so far...

334
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,366

"Webster's Dictionary
defines?"

That's the Jim Belushi
of speech openings...

00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:12,125
It accomplishes nothing,
but everyone keeps using it
and nobody understands why.

339
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,501
Yeah, well,

don't believe in marriage.

I do.
It's inevitable.

343

a counter across here
and the ovens there.

the quarterly earnings be?

the fiscal...

makes no sense.

to be the start of us
getting back to normal.

Yes.

went out the door

an odd thought.

What if once you go
from being weird to normal,

something nice
at her wedding.

This is the rehearsal.
Shut up, Leonard!

404
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:43,568
Those teenage girls
you play ping-pong with
are doing it ironically.

405
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,654
Well!
I searched my heart

406
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:50,575
for something nice to say
at a wedding.

407
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,827
And I found nothing,
so I had a drink.

408
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:55,288
And then
I looked real hard.

409
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,957
And you know
what I found?

410
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:05,214
My daddy said he would stay
with my mommy forever,
and he left!

411

Marriage is a lie!
Nobody commits to this!

Nobody stays
with anybody forever,
so why do we keep lying?

that's all I'm ever gonna be!

to believe that?

believes it, jackass!

of layers to this.

to follow, but...

was all about, Andre?

you see that's not all
I'm about anymore.

are you two doing?

I am a fool.

for a life of this.

what kind of wedding
I could throw

gave a crap?

Being good at weddings
doesn't make you good
at marriage.

00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,793
Exactly. People can
make all sorts
of promises,

448

but they never
stick it out.

It's not something you
just stick out, man,
all right?

450
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,173
It's a risk
that you take together.

451
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,925
And you don't
just promise it once.

452
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,677
You got to promise it
every day.

453
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:35,388
Yes, but the person you're
making promises to
is going to change.

454
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,681
You have to
accept that.

455
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:39,893
I do. But do you promise
to be patient

456
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:42,353
when that person's
stereo business
takes a little while

457
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,605
to get off the ground.
I do, but...

458
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,232
Do you accept that ten years
is more than a little while

459
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,775
and that iPods
aren't going away,

460
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:49,360
and maybe it's time
to let somebody else
take the lead?

461
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:52,780
I do.

462
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,991
You do?

463
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:58,494
Yes, baby,
I swear I do.

464
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:02,081

whatever it takes
to make this work forever.

the sandwich place.

510
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:53,442
What? Pierce and I
put a lot of work
into that idea.

511
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:55,695
How could you
do this, Dean?
I'm sorry!

512
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,321
The board went over my head
on this one.

513
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:00,116
And I don't remember being
invited to your wedding,

514
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:03,036
so I guess we're even on
the hurting-each-other front.

515
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,164
I'm a blast at weddings.

516
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,333
There go all my dreams.

517
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,877
This is just a setback.

518
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,253
You don't have to give up
just because of Subway.

519
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,214
Guess I better go break
the news to Pierce.

520
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,924
He's not
gonna like this.

521
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,509
Remember that
temper tantrum he threw

522
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,219
when Adam Sandler "stole"
his idea for <i> Jack and Jill?</i>

523
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,971
You're underestimating him.

524
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:24,765
I think Pierce is
a lot more mature than
we all give him credit for.

525
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:29,228
PIERCE: Look at me now, Dad!
How's it taste?

526
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:32,272
How many sandwich places
did you have?

527
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:34,734
(CACKLES) None!

528
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,112
