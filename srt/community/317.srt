<i>These are their stories.</i>

7
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:15,098
You'll be better off
without her.

8
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,643
She was perfect.
Warm, smart, beautiful.

9
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:21,062
I'm never gonna
find another dental
hygienist like that.

10
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,356
Well, you should
stop hitting on her.

11
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:25,024
Hey, she's the one
putting her hands
in my mouth.

12
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:26,944
Hey!

13
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:28,028
Over here.

14
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,534
Move along,
nothing to see here.

15
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,160
That's the first time
those words have
actually been true.

16
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:36,954
Ms. Edison,
when you called me
down here at midnight,

17
00:00:36,996 --> 00:00:38,622
I expected
more than a yam.

18
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:40,624
Specifically since you said,
"There's been a murder."

19
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:41,834
Our yam was murdered.

20
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:43,460
If it's any consolation,
she got me here

21
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:45,253
on a very misleading
text message.

22
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,297
Jeff, technically,
you are about to be screwed
in the biology room

23
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:49,048
because our final project
has been destroyed.

24
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,259
All right, look,
I'm sorry for your loss.

25
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,554
I know you guys put
the work in, so you'll
get a passing grade.

26
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,055
A passing grade?

27
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,306
Like a C?

28
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:58,600
Why don't I just
get pregnant at
a bus station?

29
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,686
That was going to be
an A+ yam.

30
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:03,981
I can't give an A+
to everyone whose yam
falls off a counter.

31
00:01:04,023 --> 00:01:06,066
Somebody did this to us.

32
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:08,443
In science,
we call that a hypothesis.

33
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,863
You find something
to back it up
and we can talk.

34
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:12,865
Now if you'll excuse me,
I was watching <i> Mama's Family.</i>

35
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,327
What happened?
Our yam was killed.

36
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,538
But Professor Kane says
we can still get an A
If we figure out who did it.

37
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,081
He did not say that.
He basically did.

38
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:23,000
You let me handle
the nitty-gritty.

39
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:25,002
In the meantime,
I need somebody
to drum up suspects.

40
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:28,005
I can help you with that.
I watch crime shows
when I'm bored.

41
00:01:28,047 --> 00:01:29,423
You boys,
canvas for witnesses,

42
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,717
establish a time frame
and motive
and bring me a suspect.

43
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,134
You've got 48 hours
before the trail runs cold,

44
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,887
so start with the last person
to see that yam alive.

45
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:36,388
Yes, ma'am.
Understood.

46
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,474

to pull the short straw?

49
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,188
It's not a short straw.

50
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,106
It's a hot potato.

51
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:50,527
Yeah, well,
looks pretty cold to me.

52
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:53,864
Cold? Or dead?

do the zinger.

Sure, I always say
you guys should ask
me more questions.

Did you water
our biology yam
last night?

66
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,927
Of course I watered it.
It was my turn, wasn't it?

67
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:58,137
I hold up my end.

68
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:00,639
Did you hold it
or drop it?

69
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,433
Okay, whoa,
I had nothing
to do with that.

get in the room.

Make up your mind, Pierce.
Did you water the yam
or weren't you there?

72
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,149
Okay, I lied
about watering it.

73
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:12,191
I got there too late,

already locked.

00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,202
It was my yam too.

Look, even if
I wanted to hurt
your yam, I couldn't.

98
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,784
I went by the bio room at 8:10
to chart my yam's growth,

99
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:03,994
the door was already locked.

100

There's a lot of that
going around.

101
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,621
Oh, yeah.
It's true.

102
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,916
I had to take
a picture of my yam
through the door.

103
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,125
See?

104
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,377
Your yam was fine
when I left.

105
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:18,341
I transferred or "downloaded"
Todd's photograph
to this computer

106
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,468
and as you'll see,
with a few adjustments,

107
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,262
I can make the entire image...

00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,640

gets locked at 8:00.

Which means whoever
did the crime...

118
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:44,034
Got in there before
the doors were locked
and stayed there for hours.

122

from the front office.

00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,751

I could...

can check out a key

currently taking classes
and show school ID.

172
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,506
Look, I'll try
to keep him busy.

173
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:07,261
You guys go to the lab,
see if they figured out
how our yam met its masher.

174
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,888
I can, both,
see and hear you.

175
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,475
The yam's vascular cylinder
is completely disintegrated.

176
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,270
Any possibility
it happened naturally?

177
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,646
Sure, if the gardener's
Joseph Mengele.

178
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,023
Look at the root system.

179
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,775
This level of smushing

180
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:24,194
is consistent with
someone stepping on the yam
after it was dropped.

181
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:25,987
So whoever did this
was angry.

182
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:29,283
Hey, I just cut 'em open.
You want motive,
talk to a shrink.

183
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:32,327
What I can tell you
is that for a raw yam
to get it this bad,

184
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,288
you need more than gravity.

185
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,455
You need a boot.

(GAGS)

187
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,086
We have to tell
Professor Kane.

188
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:42,712
There's nothing here
to connect to Star-Burns.
He'd have to confess.

189
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,339
Oh, yeah, sure.

190
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,007
Maybe if we ask him nice,
he'll write us
a love letter too.

191
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:49,803
Well, whoever
did do this does
owe you guys a letter.

192
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,138
An A.

193
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:56,101
This yam was
about to bloom.

194
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:58,895
Damn.

195
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:00,730
We named the yam "Pam."

196
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,109
It rhymed.

197
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,696
Even if we could prove
that Star-Burns stole
Magnitude's key,

198
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,781
it's not enough.

199
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,158
But we know
Star-Burns did it.

Keep the hot dog.

You're telling me
after all this,

203
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,080
our suspect's
gonna slip away

204
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,166
on the technicality
that we're not police?

205
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,168
Okay, look,
you don't need authority
to get a confession.

206
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,128
You need leverage.
Something to hold
over his head.

207
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,545
Like what?
He's Star-Burns.

208
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:25,713
Break into his locker.

209
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:26,840
You'll find enough dirt
to bury him.

210

Jeff, that's not ethical.

you have to do.

to get compassionate.

to get justice.

be doing this.

No.

Tell it
to the biology professor.

00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,278
Oh, now wait!
I know who did it.

237
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,197
I left the door open
and someone came in.

238
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,115
He dropped your yam.

239
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,783
Will you tell
our teacher who it was?

If you promise
I won't get in trouble

241
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:38,870
for stealing that
meth lab stuff.

242
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,080
Sure, whatever.
Fine.

00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,591
and then I saw him
running out of the room
holding his hand.

248
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:54,135
Looked like he cut himself.

definitive proof that Todd,

264
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,671
with malice of forethought,
smashed our yam.

265
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,882

why in hell he's
being harassed.

00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,914
Mr. Winger,
what is the intention here?

281
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:07,959
Simple.
When Todd smashed our yam,
he stole an A from us.

282
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,252
We want it back.

283
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,338
You mean
if he smashed the yam.

of this Mr. Star-Burns,

as to why he was at the scene.

doing there?

with the witness.

291
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,854

of a degenerate

with the man in uniform.

was doing there
is irrelevant.

is what he saw.

as good as his uniform.

Now out here,
it's supposed to be different.

308
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,847
And in my class,
it will be.

309
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,474

321
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,747
Shirley did some
more digging.

322
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,791
Turns out Todd's yam
never even sprouted.

00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,544
Goes to motive.

324
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:35,129
And Star-Burns puts Todd
in the classroom at 8:10.

325
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,881
Opportunity.

326
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,383
Add to that a cut
on the hand
and the Winger charm,

327
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,093
we might get an A++.

328
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,386
We still have
a lot of work to do.

329
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:42,845
Oh, I think you've
done enough.

330
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,723
Colonel Archwood
got to Star-Burns.

00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:46,516
Threatened to involve
the real cops.

332
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:47,808
Now Star-Burns
is in the wind.

you guys do in here?

and you make your
little speeches,

another dirtbag walks?
