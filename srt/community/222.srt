force anything, won't you?

that baby out of Shirley.

Okay, at each
contraction,

373
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,419

Shirley to push.

Okay, so in World War II,

a lot of us were rounded up
in labor camps, mining mostly.

390

Hundreds of Changs were born
underneath the earth.

five years underground.
