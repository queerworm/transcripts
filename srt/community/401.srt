(APPLAUSE AND LAUGHTER)

00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:09,301
Wait a minute.
Something's changed.

4
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:11,052
Oh, there's 12 additional
thumb tacks on that board.

5
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:13,180
They're driving me crazy.
(LAUGH TRACK)

6
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:16,350
No, I meant this.
Trying out the hipster look.

7
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,226
It's cool,
but also not.

8
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,353
(LAUGH TRACK)

9
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,188
Hey, guys,
have a good summer?

10
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:22,606
Take them off.

11
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:24,107
(LAUGH TRACK)

12
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,443
Happy first day
of school.

13
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:28,111
Oh.
(LAUGH TRACK)

14
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,614
Good morning.
I brought brownies.

15
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:31,949
Oh.

16
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:35,703
Congratulations, it's me.

17
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:41,500
Huh, I see
we've all reinvented
ourselves over the summer.

18
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,210
A little late
to the hipster party much?

19
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,128
A little much
on the much much?

20
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,755
(LAUGH TRACK)

21
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:48,966
We should get to class?
Where's Pierce?
I don't know.

22
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:50,049
Hey-o!

23
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:53,929
Sorry, I'm late.

24
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,015
Damn Mexican cleaning woman
did a cha-cha

25
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,809
on my glasses,
so I got to wear
this old pair.

00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:00,101

BRITTA: <i> Abed. Abed.</i>

28
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:06,984
Abed.
Yup.

29
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:08,610
Did you go
to your happy place?
Yeah.

30
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:11,196
Did you envision
a babbling brook
like I described?

31
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,447
I started out
with a babbling brook,

32
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,241
but then I layered in elements
from our world.

33
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,826
I'm sure fans
of the babbling brook
will complain,

34
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:16,994
but I thought
that was limiting.

35
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:18,495
Well, it's best
to keep it simple.

36
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:20,080
It was a babbling brook.
Okay.

37
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,707
Here's the deal,
Jessica Biel.

38
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:25,044
The first day of senior year
is emotional for everyone,

39
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:27,212
so I hereby therapize you
to go

40
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:30,382
to your happy place
whenever you feel stressed.

41
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:33,761
I found
my lucky notebook.
Found my lucky charm.

42
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,179
Abed, you ready for our last
first day of school?

43
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:39,098
Are you ready, buddy?

44
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,101
I just need a minute.

00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,305
I can't believe we're finally
getting into this class.

58
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:19,556
I can't believe
there's a class

59
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:20,891
called The History
of Ice Cream.

60
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:23,518
Seniors! (LAUGHS)

61
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,854
There they are.

62
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:30,985
Seniors!

63
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:33,904
Oh, speaking of seniors,
I've decided I'm going
to do senioritis this year.

64
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:36,949
You know, just hangin' out
and blowin' off classes,

65
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:39,493
pullin' pranks,
not sayin' my g's.

66
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,954
Ooh, I'll pull
some pranks with you.

67
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:44,247
Okay.
Or Jeff or whoever.

68
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,499
You know, whoever's around.
Whatever.

69
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,542
So, Abed, after class,
we're still doing

70
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,086
our first-day-of-school
tradition, right?
You know it.

71
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:50,462
We like to make wishes
in the fountain.

72
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,630
BOTH: Oh!

73
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,008
Fellas, I hate to tell you,
wishes aren't real.

74
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,593
If you want something bad,
you have to work for it.

75
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:57,886
Or use a spell.

76
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,471
All of our wishes
come true.

77
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,141
Last year, Troy wished we got
bin Laden and the Dorito Taco.

78
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:03,767
Yeah, but Obama got credit
for both.

79
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:06,061
Could you wish for Jeff
to be on time for once?

80
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:08,438
No. No wasting wishes
on impossibilities.

81
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,773
We have to make
this year count,

82
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:10,941
especially
since it's the last one.

83
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:13,527
(DRAMATIC MUSIC)

84
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,404
Oh, no, is all this for
The History of Ice Cream?

85
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,657
They overbooked it, so it's
first come, first serve now.

86
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,034
Oh, just like
real ice cream.

87
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:21,409
Guys, over here.

88
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,536
SHIRLEY: Oh, Jeffrey!

89
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,126
Jeff, I can't believe
that you came early.

90
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:30,418
Don't you read
Garrett's Twitter feed?

91
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,337
He posted a crisis alert
about it.

92
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,881
I came early
to save seats.

93
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:37,009
Oh, you know what, girls,
I gave you the old flyer.

94
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:39,219
Instagram for Besties
is in room 44.

95
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,723
Showing up early,
helping others,

96
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,307
sending girls away?

97
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,393
Could this be
a whole new Jeff Winger?

98
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:47,936
Don't ruin it
by approving it.

99
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,526
Oh, so that's progressed.

100
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,195
I mean, it's progressed,

101
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,905
but it hasn't
progressed-progressed.

102
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:58,947
It's progressive.

103
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,240
Good luck, Troy.

104
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:03,243
Hey! You can't
just walk in here!

105
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,245
I've been pissing in jars
for an hour

106
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,705
trying to keep this seat.

107
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:07,998
Oh.
Too bad, Leonard.

108
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,833
(OVERLAPPING STATEMENTS)
All right, all right.

109
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,377
All right.
Simmer dean.

110
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,755
This can't be good.
He's dressed as himself.

111
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:18,050
Greendale's registration
system has been hacked.

112
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:20,301
That's right.
Someone hacked

113
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,303
into the supply closet
and counterfeited

114
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,514
these History of Ice Cream
admission cards.

115
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:28,309
(GASPS)
Whoever did this
is very good.

116
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,771
There is only one fair way
to solve this.

117
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:34,233
So follow me to...

118
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,408
(CONTINUES SAYING "TO")

119
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:00,383
The Hunger Deans!

120
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,551
(SCATTERED APPLAUSE)

121
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,137
Thank you.
Thank you.

122
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:06,347
There are 35 tests
of strength and agility.

123
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,850
The winner of each one
of these contests

124
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,394
will be awarded
a red rubber ball.

125
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,438
No ball,
no ice cream.

126
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,191
And these are impossible
to counterfeit

127
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:20,570
because each one
has been marked
by my distinct bite print.

128
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,697
Oh, Lord, no.
Yes.

129
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,158
Guys, we need
to take this class.

130
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,160
It's the only history credit
this semester.

131
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,745
Whatevs.
We'll take it next semes.

132
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:30,122
Ter. Semester.

133
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:32,166
But I need it now.

134
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:35,002
Okay, I took
some extra classes online,

135
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,878
and I'm one
history credit away
from graduating.

136
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,631
(GASPS)
Jeff, you're
graduating early?

137
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,383
Well, graduating after 30
can't be characterized
as early.

138
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:43,885
When were you gonna
tell us, Jeff?

139
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,095
I was working on a speech.

140
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:47,681
And, believe me,
it tied in a lot of things.

141
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,267
There was a lot
of resolutions
and epiphanies.

142
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:52,144
And it would have gone down
a lot better

143
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:54,188
after we had taken
the ice cream class
together.

144
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,814
So that's why
you were holding
our seats?

145
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,356
For your own
selfish reasons?

146
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,151
No, I want us
to take the class together.

147
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:01,569
I just want it to be
the last class
we take together.

148
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,238
(GASPS)
I probably should have
phrased that differently.

149
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,115
Fine.
Win your red ball.

150
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:07,742
What do I care? I've got
a senior prank to pull.

151
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,077
Shirley.
Mmm-hmm.

152
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,495
So, Abed, ready
to make some wishes?

153
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,789
Make chocolate hot dogs
a reality?

154
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,166
Actually, why don't you go
with Britta?

155
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,125
I think I'll just
hang out here and watch.

156
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,584
Really?
Are you sure?

157
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:20,130
Yeah, I'm fine.
F-I-N-E or F-Y-N-E?

158
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,882
We made one of 'em a code
for "not fine."

159
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,718
BOTH: Oh.
F-Y-N-E.

160
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,427
Okay, he's fine.
Let's go.

161
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,638
See you around,
old Jeff.
No.

162
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,474
New Jeff. New Jeff does not
just look out for himself.

163
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,392
New Jeff is gonna win
seven red balls

164
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,187
because he is not gonna
take that class

165
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,064
unless you guys
are with me.

166
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:40,275
Look, we're gonna have
to leave this place
sometime.

167
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,819
Like an ice cream cone
melting in the sun,

168
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:45,739
our time here
can't last forever.

169
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,406
That was part of the speech
I was writing!

170
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:51,494
Hey, guys.
What's going on?

171
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,580
Oh, just making plans
for the future.

172

into a disaster.

348
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:13,144
I was this close
to getting those two girls.

349
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,355
Jeff, look how close
you're holding
your fingers together.

350
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,731
That's your penis.

351
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,316
(LAUGH TRACK)

352
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,900
Guys, great news.

353
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,444
After just
one forensics class,

354
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,738
I found a way to retrieve
our student records.

355
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,448
It turns out
there's a backup.

356
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,616
And it's in this safe.

357
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:28,576
(AUDIENCE REACTIONS)

358
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:35,166
I have a theory, Dean.

359
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,459
Do tell.

360
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,795
I don't think
you want me to graduate.

361
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:40,880
Don't be absurd, Jeffrey.

362
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,090
I want success
for all Greendale students.

363
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,552
Oh, really?
Then answer me this.

364
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,804
What happened
to the other history class?

365
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:49,013
What other history class?

366
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:51,808
The second history class,

367
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,685
the one that
actually taught history,

368
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,603
that disappeared
from the schedule

369
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,731
after I took
summer classes.

370
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:59,691
Oh, you're telling yourself
a fantasy.

371
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:02,235
Who really made
those counterfeited
ice cream tickets?

372
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,738
Who's so good
that they got
your handwriting

373
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:06,364
with its hearts
and flourishes?

374
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,783
Oh, God, you're right.

375
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,201
I can't let you go,
Jeffrey.

376
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,661
You weren't supposed
to compete.

377
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:12,912
You were supposed
to walk away

378
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,121
with the rest
of the study group.

379
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,999
You can't not get rid of me
that easily.

380
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,960
Oh, God, why'd I make it
feats of strength and grace?

381
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:23,757
It's as if I wanted you
to win.

382
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,925
But that can't be true.

383
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,555
Smile. Best friends.

384
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:31,848
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

385
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,980
Let's hug it out.
Okay.

386
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,818
Here.
One more ball to go.

387
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,236
But it's another
dance contest,

388
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,280
so I think I got it.

389
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,489
What's wrong with Abed?

390
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:55,955
No, no, no, no,
don't open the safe.

391
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,290
We're redoing
our first three years.

392
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,459
That's what I want.
It's okay, Abed.

393
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,086
Here's a trick I use
when I feel overwhelmed.

394
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:05,339
Just imagine a happy place
and then go there.

395
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,054
ALL:
<i>♪ Greendale babies</i>

396
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,641

00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,643

401
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,780
<i>♪ Greendale babies ♪</i>

402
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,990
Pierce, what did you do
to Abed?

403
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,242
Gay balls!

404
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:34,285
Nailed it.

405
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,289
Don't ask.
Don't tell.

406
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:41,292
Poor Abed. Is he
in his Imagination Emporium?

407
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,795
Dreamatorium.
No, this seems
like something new.

408
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:47,632
Abed was having some anxiety
about all the changes
this year,

409
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:51,260
so I may have told him to go
to a happy place in his mind.

410
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:54,054
You told him
to go somewhere
in his mind?

411
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,723
Do you realize
who you told that to?

412
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:59,268
The last competition
to win a red ball
begins in one minute.

413
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,812
Honestly, Jeff,
you can go.

414
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,021
No one will think
you're selfish.

415
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,065
This looks bad.

416
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,067
I wish
I hadn't broken Abed.

417
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,529
There is one thing
we could try.

418
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,865
Oh, okay.

419
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,370
(GRUNTS)

420
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,624
Hey, let's play pretend.

421
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,417
Yeah, we could be cowboys.

422
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,794
We could be spacemen.

423
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:26,504
(BABBLING)

424
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,633
That's right, baby Pierce.
We can play forever.

425
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,637
It's not working.
What's not working?

426
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,932
Okay, contestants,
final competition
begins right now.

427
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,685
God, I hate new Jeff.

428
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:45,314
Hey, guys,
I have something to say.

429
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:47,191
ALL:
Yay! Like always!

430
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,318
I was just
outside Babyville.

431
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,945
There's nothing
outside Babyville.

432
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,197
You know what,
there is!

433
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,866
And it was scary,

434
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,326
because change
is always scary.

435
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:59,119
But then I thought
of you guys,

436
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,163
and I wasn't so scared.

437
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,999
Abed, when you brought
this group together,

438
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:06,669
you changed our lives,
but then we changed
each other.

439
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:09,171
And we're gonna
keep changing
in unexpected ways.

440
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,007
And we're still
gonna be friends,

441
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:13,133
even if we don't all become
professors at Greendale

442
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,177
or open
a restaurant together

443
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,972
or move into the same
apartment building
after Pierce dies.

444
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:19,473
(LAUGH TRACK)

445
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,894
Even if we go somewhere,
we're not going anywhere.

446
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:25,271
ALL: Aw.

447
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:26,480
(APPLAUSE)

448
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:37,116
That was a killer
speech, Jeff.

449
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:39,077
Oh.
I didn't say anything.

450
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,494
I literally just walked up.

451
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,788
I know.
I made the speech for you.

452
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,289
It hit all the right notes.

453
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,582
I was trying to hang on
to this moment

454
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,333
because I was so afraid
of the future,

455
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,669
but then I realized
all of this was
once the future.

456
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,922
And it was completely
different from
what I'd known before.

457
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:52,673
And it was
happening so fast,

458
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,760
but in the end,
or in the now, I guess,
it turned out great.

459
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:59,055
And just like ice cream,
we've melted together
and made a new...

460
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:00,807
I just had to
run the scenario
to figure it out.

461
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:01,933
Oh.

462
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,434
Sorry I missed
the fountain.

463
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,561
It's okay.
Britta introduced
a new rule...

464
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,105
No rules.

465
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,481
Cool.
We can discuss it.

466
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:11,358
When they were incepting,
I got their balls.

467
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,239
Well, now that we're out
of History of Ice Cream,

468
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,909
I can finally take
Advanced Claims Denial.

469
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:22,036
You should take Forensics.

470
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,084
Can somebody tell me
what the hell we just did?

471
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,754
Jeffrey.
Jeffrey, wait.

472
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,089
Dean, what are you...
(SNIFFS)

473
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:34,966
Oh! You smell like the floor
of a movie theater.

474
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,550
Yeah, but not
for the usual reasons.

475
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,177
I have had the worst day.

476
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,637
Our dance photo
didn't come out,

477
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,221
someone moved
my stapler,

478
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:44,058
and, worst of all,
I hurt you.

479
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,895
But you'll be happy to know
that we'll be offering
another history class,

480
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,271
because I care about you.

481
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,982
And not because I found out
if we don't offer

482
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:53,901
a real history class
we'll lose, like,
$40,000 in grant money.

483
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,820
Thank you, Dean.

484
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,113
By the way, you didn't have
to come all this way
to tell me that.

485
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:59,490
Oh, no,
it wasn't a problem.

486
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,075
It's on my way.

487
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,620
Please tell me
you're breaking
into that condo.

488
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,413
No, I bought it.

489
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,666
Now we'll be
like almost roomies.

490
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,835
Oh, good, you got wine.
I've got
<i>Friends With Benefits.</i>

No subtext.

492
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,048
I don't know why I was
so worried about change.

493
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:16,757
This year's gonna be great.

494
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:17,800
I'll be right over.

Ah!
Not so fast, you two.

00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,091
Get ready to run.
In these heels?

get those dresses?
