1
00:00:02,586 --> 00:00:05,506
This is a historic day
for Greendale.

2
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:10,469
This state-of-the-art Subway
sandwichery in our cafetorium

3
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:13,388
represents Greendale's
first steps forward

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,557
into the realm
of the legitimate!

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,934
STUDENTS: Ooh.

6
00:00:16,976 --> 00:00:18,393
Oh, oh. No problem.
You know what?

7
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,896
I'm just going to
get it started
with my teeth.

8
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:23,482
The legitimate! Oh.
The legitimate!

9
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:24,984
That should be
my sandwich shop.

10
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:26,902
It was my idea
to put one there.

11
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,445
We're here for you,
Shirley.
Yeah.

12
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:30,405
Troy, Annie, and I
know what it's like
to be displaced.

13
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,366
They're tenting
our building for termites,
so we're homeless.

14
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,075
I'm staying
in the sleep study lab.

15
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,911
All I have to do is wake up
every three hours and go...

16
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:38,706
(SCREAMS)
And I get two credits.

17
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,123
Yeah,
and we're going to build

18
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:41,000
a super awesome pillow fort
here at the school.

19
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,209
Another pillow fort?

20
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,003
Kind of repeating
yourselves, aren't you?

21
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:46,588
That was a blanket fort.
This will be a pillow fort.

22
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,507
Way more difficult,
way better.

23
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:50,676
All difficult things
are better,
like carrying a disease

24
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:52,720
or holding in
a fart right now.
Ah-ha!

25
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,597
I just found out
how Shirley and I are
going to take down Subway.

26
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,975
Oh, how?
Dean?

27
00:00:58,017 --> 00:01:00,185
I assume you're familiar
with the Greendale bylaws.

28
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,812
I am not.

29
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:03,355
Shirley,
you do the honors.

30
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:05,148
My brain starts
getting weird
this time of night.

31
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,734
It's 10:00 a.m.

32
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,652
You're welcome.
Uh-oh.

33
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:11,321
"Any business
operating for profit
on Greendale's campus

34
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:15,158
"must be at least 51%
owned by a registered
Greendale student"!

35
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,370
That's too bad, Dean.
I don't recall
seeing Subway

36
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,205
in my premenopausal,
postfeminist

37
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:22,082
experiential
marketing class.

38
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:24,043
Actually,
I'm on the wait list

39
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:25,627
for the
premen/postfem/ex mark.

40
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:27,046
Who are you?

41
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:29,840
Gang, meet Greendale's
newest student, Subway.

42
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:31,967
Your name is Subway?

43
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,345
Yep, using a groundbreaking
but surprisingly legal process

44
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:38,348
known as corpohumanization,
real people such as myself

45
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:42,061
are now allowed to represent
the collective humanity
of business owners.

46
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:44,354
I have contractually waived
my birth identity

47
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:49,109
and am now
a man and student
named Subway.

48
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:51,612
I don't believe this.

49
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,822
Come on, Subway,
there is no way
you're 5'10".

50
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,784
So you can vote?

51
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,744
Actually, no,
because technically
I'm only a week old.

52
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:00,829
Aw.

53
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,289
But please don't think of me
as any less human
than yourselves.

54
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,541
I'm here to hang out,
take weird classes,

55
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:07,544
and party as hearty
as my morality clause
allows.

56
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:10,505
Eat fresh? Eat fresh?

57
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,092
Eat fresh.
That's my man.

58
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,468
Wow, did you know
Greendale students

59
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:17,137
are technically
in the Army Reserves?

60
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:21,558
Let's say a little prayer
for peace.

61
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,853
<i>♪ Give me some rope</i>
<i>Tie me to dream</i>

62
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:28,023
<i>♪ Give me the hope</i>
<i>to run out of steam</i>

63
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:31,485
<i>♪ Somebody said</i>
<i>it can be here</i>

64
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:35,405
<i>♪ We could be roped up,</i>
<i>tied up, dead in a year</i>

65
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:40,410
<i>♪ I can't count the reasons</i>
<i>I should stay</i>

66
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:44,748
<i>♪ One by one they all</i>
<i>just fade away ♪</i>

67
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,921
Annie,
you've got to get me
into this sleep lab.

68
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:52,714
I can't think
of a better use
of my time here

69
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:53,799
than being unconscious.

70
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:55,383
It's not a blow-off class,
Jeff.

71
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,511
We're only allowed to bring
one stuffed animal.

72
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,387
I'm bringing Ruthie...

73
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,765
(WHISPERS)
But using her pouch
to sneak in Nathan.

74
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,976
Well, have fun.

75
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,604
Wait, since when
do we have lockers?

76
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:11,025
Uh, since
Registration Day, 2009.

77
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:14,402
Jeff, did you skip
the Pre-orientation Freshman
Welcome Seminar

78
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,613
and Diversity Fire Circle?

79
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,573
This explains so much
about you.

80
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,200
Are you saying
I've had a locker here
for two and a half years?

81
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:27,749
Whoa, whoa. Wow.

82
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,877
"Halloween dance."
"Post-halloween dance."

83
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,170
"Dance contest."

84
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,838
"Contest dance."
Oh, come on.

85
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,008
What's this? "Save Garrett"?
What's wrong with Garrett?

86
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,218
Nothing now.
We saved him.

87
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,221
Aah!

88
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:42,514
Wait,
that's "saved" Garrett?

89
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,934
Ooh, what's this?
Love letter?

90
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,145
Oh, it's probably
one of many.

91
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:50,064
Oh, no.
This is a hate letter.

92
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:51,815
What?
Let me see that.

93
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:53,400
"Dear Jeff,
this might come as a shock

94
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,318
"to someone who thinks
he's God's gift
to the world,

95
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,196
"but you're actually
an inconsiderate jerk.

96
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,321
"Kim."

97
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,407
"Inconsiderate"?
Who's Kim?

98
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,367
I don't know, and clearly
she doesn't know me.

99
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,827
(SNEEZES)
GIRL: Gesundheit.

100
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,453
I didn't sneeze.

101
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,747
(SCOFFS)

102
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:12,044
Look at these idiots.
Cattle, sheep...

103
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:14,295
Other animals
that travel in herds.

104
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,589
I want to say snakes.

105
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,758
Am I the only person
enraged by the fact

106
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,885
that corporations
are taking human form?

107
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:22,888
I totally predicted this
in my high school
newspaper column

108
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,305
"Britta Unfiltered."

109
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,725
Unfiltered. I get it.
Get what?

110
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:30,729
Actually, maybe Subway
taking human form
could be its undoing.

111
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,231
Uh, Britta...

112
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,357
You're a, uh,
progressive woman

113
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,862
of a more
liberated looseness.

114
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:41,615
You could get close to Subway
and find out some dirt on him.

115
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,700
Corporate espionage.
I like it.

116
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,077
Microphones hidden
in lipstick.

117
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:46,995
Lipstick hidden
in microphones.

118
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,789
And the deadliest weapon
of them all...

119
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,207
The penis flytrap.

120
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:52,251
Okay!
This conversation is over.

121
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,003
I am not a whore,
and not that
I've done the math,

122
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,422
but if I were, I'd be
the super classy kind

123
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:00,134
that gets flown
to Dubai to stay
in an underwater hotel.

124
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,973
Abed, Troy.

125
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,390
Ah, don't worry, Dean.

126
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,767
We have all
the proper permits
right here.

127
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,269
Oh, silly me!

128
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,188
This is a coupon for 20% off
at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.

129
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:17,317
No need to bribe me, Troy.
Actually...

130
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:18,652
There's plenty more
where that came from.

131
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,362
Look, I was just Googling
record lengths of stuff,

132
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,657
and apparently there's
a Guinness World Record

133
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,034
for the biggest pillow
or blanket fort.

134
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,078
So you boys...
You should go for it.

135
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,579
Put this school
on the map.

136
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,583
We'd have a better chance
of setting the record

137
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,128
if we made this
a blanket fort,
you know, take less time.

138
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,879
We wanted to make
a pillow fort.

139
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,756
I don't want
to sacrifice quality
for square footage.

140
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,466
We don't need
a world record to tell us
we did something cool.

141
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:42,550
But if we won,
we might meet that dude

142
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,760
with the curly
fingernails.

143
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,470
Shridhar Chillal?
Not interested.

144
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,181
I saw him on a talk show.
He came off as pretentious.

145
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,351
I'm going to
go get a drink.
Okay.

146
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,772
Troy Barnes.

147
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:56,982
Vice Dean Laybourne.

148
00:05:57,024 --> 00:06:00,194
You have a beard
and a ponytail.

149
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:01,569
Going through some stuff
right now, Troy.

150
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,655
Don't worry about it.
(CLEARS THROAT)

151
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,157
Any chance you've given
a second thought to joining

152
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,159
my air conditioning
repair school?

153
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:08,910
Sorry.

154
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,787
Kind of busy at the moment
doing some awesome work
with Abed.

155
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:13,081
Ah, yeah, Abed.

156
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,917
You guys watch that
television show together,
don't you?

157
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,544
<i>Inspector Spacetime.</i>

158
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:18,712
Funny, Troy.

159
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,588
You and Abed have
always reminded me

160
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,883
of the Inspector and
his trusty constable Reggie.

161
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,134
(CHUCKLES) Cool!

162
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:26,261
The Inspector, of course,
is smart, decisive,

163
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,929
and Reggie is...

164
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:30,349
Well, he's Reggie.

165
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:33,977
Reggie is trained
in zero-gravity martial arts
and has a whistle.

166
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,478
(WHISPERS) Yeah.

167
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,564
But he never really
gets to blow the whistle

168
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:40,775
unless the Inspector
says it's okay.

169
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,362
Less of a friendship,
more of a self-centered nerd

170
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:45,697
and his naive,
obedient lapdog.

171
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:46,948
Well, I got a thing.

172
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,575
You take care.

173
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,662
Well, according to the office,
this is the locker

174
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:56,541
of the only Kim I've had
any class with since 2009.

175
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,877
Wonder what you did
to make her so mad.

176
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,047
Maybe the two of you made out,
and then you forgot about her.

177
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:04,925
Annie, that's what
you think of me?

178
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,425
I don't make out
with forgettable women.

179
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,719
Can I help you?

180
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,263
We're looking
for Kim McFadden.

181
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:10,389
This is her locker,
right?

182
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,140
Are you serious?

183
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,475
She slipped a note
into my locker
a couple years ago.

184
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,810
I guess I pissed her off
somehow.

185
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,062
I'm hoping to apologize.

186
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:19,273
That might not be easy.

187
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,566
Kim's no longer
with us.

188
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,443
She died two weeks ago.

189
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:24,485
What?

190
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,280
Sorry to drop that
on you and run,

191
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,948
but there's a rally
for Garrett.

192
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,657
But we saved him.

193
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,035
Did we?

194
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,292
What do you recommend?

195
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,377
What's it to you,
meat pusher?

196
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:42,379
Sounds like you might
be a vegetarian.

197
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:43,671
You should try
Subway's Veggie Delite.

198
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,216
You should try reading
Orwell's <i> 1984.</i>

199
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:47,842
I have.
It's a great book.

200
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,510
It really awakened me
in high school.

201
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,553
I think kids should
be forced to read it.

202
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:53,765
Me too.
Anyway, you're living it.

203
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,393
You're a human puppet
with big sandwich's
hand up your ass.

204
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:58,103
Is this what you dreamt
of being?

205
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:01,231
Unfortunately
I'm not allowed to
discuss my former life

206
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:02,983
or engage in any
nonplatonic relations,

207
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,484
practice religion
in public,

208
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,569
or eat any nonfresh,
unhealthy food like that

209
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,071

outside Subway.

210
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:09,739
Why are you getting
all that?

211
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,491
I wanted to
stand next to you
for a moment.

212
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,077
It was worth it.

213
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:17,122
Like a good book by Orwell
or a Veggie Delite.

214
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,587

I think you might see
more than all of us.

this paragraph.

I can't say
that I did.

234
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,104
I just think it's
a striking expression
of love's ability

00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:26,733
to persevere within
the cracks and cogs
of inhuman systems.

She is someone who died
thinking I was a dick.

I can never
apologize.

269

I can never
change her mind.

That makes me

You think that's
what an apology is?

272
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:53,945
A spell you cast
on another person to
make them forgive you?

273
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,198
Apologies are opportunities
to admit your own mistakes.

274
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,950
Apologize to her locker.

275
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,786
But how can I apologize
if I don't know
what I did wrong?

276
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:05,915
Well, didn't she call you
inconsiderate?

exactly what you did wrong.

to lie there.

for him.

Just plant this
on Subway,

and you'll never have
to see him again.

303

Is there a way
we can connect them?

You can't
connect the blanket fort
to the pillow fort

a pillow fort.

you introduced
yourself to me.

I wrote that note.

from my name that I am a girl.

but to make up
that awesome story

took him seriously.
