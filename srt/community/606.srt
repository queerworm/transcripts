I'm sorry if I used photography

506
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,736
to digitally approximate
some of your naked bodies.

507
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:13,405
It's all right.

508
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,365
-It is?
-No!

Sure.

That thing you said back there
about not being a part of anything,

515
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,310
is that really how you feel?

516
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,353
It's not a question of how I feel.

The words "common" and "courtesy"
