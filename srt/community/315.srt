the students know

13
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:22,898
that if you're on campus
this weekend,

14

you'll have to park
on the street

15
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:25,818
because of the carnival.

16
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,696
On an unrelated note,
I'm into trains now.

17
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,113
A real carnival?

18
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,491
Is the company called
Red Beard's Amusements?

19
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:33,826
Name rings a bell.

20
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:35,285
But with me,
that could mean anything.

21
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:37,204
I wonder.

22
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:39,456

Some things are funny
because they make no sense.

27
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,256
And that is not
one of them.

28
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:51,510
Well, it looks like my news
has incited some doings.

29
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:54,054
And if that's not my job,
what is?

30
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:56,015

Eh.
Administrate the school.

33
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,356
So, Britta, tell us
about your carnival
worker boyfriend.

34
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:05,941
Why, so you all can get
a big laugh?

35
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:07,108
Yeah.
I'd love to
have a laugh.

36
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,736
(GIGGLING)
The exact reason.

37
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,612
Fine. I'm not
ashamed of my past.

38
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:12,072
And if it entertains
you guys,

39
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:13,365
that's great
because we're friends.

40
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:16,326
His name is Blade and...

(HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER)

42
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,120
What?
Oh, no, Britta!

43
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:21,331
She invoked friendship
to undercut the laugh,

44
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:23,751
and we're still laughing.
That's how funny it is!

45
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,419
His name is Blade.
Is that legal?

46
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,879
Shouldn't New Line Cinema
be suing him?

47
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:29,840
He was called that
before that stupid movie.

48
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:31,800
He was called that
before the fantastic movie.

49
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,594
And it was a Marvel Comic
in 1973.

50
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:34,595

51
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,179

BRITTA: I'm glad you guys
are reacting this way.

57
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:49,150
I need to be reminded
that he is the worst
on Earth.

58
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,194
Because if he comes
through town and calls me,

59
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,154
I will be there
in five minutes.

60
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,032
I don't understand.
Uh, Andre much?

61
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:56,909
Okay, I understand.
I don't.

62
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:58,077
You will.
What's that mean?

63
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,120
He's hung.
Oh, God!

64
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,204
Pierce, you're disgusting.

65
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,331
Just like that
I'm disgusting again.

It was in my hand.

that she just can't shake
from her system

no matter much
she knows better.

70
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,634
I lucked out with Andre,
but God help me.

71
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,469
As you all know,
there's not a lot
he couldn't get away with.

72
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,430
So what, Britta?
You're in love with a guy

73
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,766
who's named after
a kickboxing
vampire movie?

74
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:23,102
A fantastic kickboxing
vampire movie.

75
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,354
No, I don't believe in love
because of this guy...

76
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,607

a kickboxing vampire movie.

your shirt?

Not if it's working.

It is Blade's carnival
that's coming.

He's working the BB gun
duck-shooting gallery.

I guess he finally got
the promotion.

99
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:29,793
And he will call me.

100
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:31,128
And left unattended,

101
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,212
I will end up doing him
like a crossword,

102
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,715
and I will regret it.

103
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,341
So I need you
to take my phone,

104
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,759
and don't give it back
until Monday!

105
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:38,844

For real?
Pipe it!

107
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,556
And I need to stay with you
this weekend.

108
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,933
Not just stay with you,
I need to be on lockdown.

I'm unable to make him
see it that way.

128
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:26,016
I need you
to change his mind.

129
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:28,227
But if he's not interested,
what can I do?

130
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,562
Dean, have we forgotten
that your school

131
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,981
is under the AC Repair
School's thumb?

Uh, we have not.

133
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:38,153
Then mine is not to tell you
how to do what I want done.

134
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:41,073
Mine is to want
and to say my want.

135

Yours is to know
and to do.

136
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,911
I know exactly what to do.

137
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:53,961

get me a, um, book
on how to do things?

138

just make me
a scotch and soda.

It has two blades.

One blade is silver,
the other blade is

Guys, could we maybe
watch a different movie

or just stop
saying that word
six times per minute?

What word?
Blade.

148
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,815
Oh, because of
Britta's ex-boyfriend.

149
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,900
Can you check
my messages for me
and tell me if he called?

150
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:17,943
I don't think
that's a good idea.

"No, your mother
isn't dying"

bachelor's degree,

and then I cheated
on the LSAT.

367

how do you cheat on the LSAT?

did it, baby.

out of high school
and joined the carnival.

here you are.

ever done in this booth?

No, I am not in love
with Britta.

And yes, I'm insanely
jealous of him.
What's his secret?

Why do you wanna
know the secret to
making a woman psycho?

we won't get
into a fight?

in his skull,

destroying
the part of his brain
that feels shame.

to people for the same reason

Why wouldn't he
have told me that?

494

if you knew.

517
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,712
TROY: Oh, yeah!
<i>That thing is freezing!</i>

518
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,797
<i>You know what could</i>
<i>learn a lesson from</i>
<i>that cold spot?</i>

519
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,841
<i>The air conditioning unit</i>
<i>in my living room.</i>

520
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:18,509
(LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY)

521
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:21,054
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>so yesterday,</i>
<i>typical Sunday.</i>

522
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:22,513
<i>I was hanging out</i>
<i>in my Dreamatorium.</i>

523
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:23,848
Whoo!

524
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,349
<i>This ever happen</i>
<i>to you guys?</i>

525
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,309
<i>I couldn't remember</i>
<i>where I imagined the door.</i>

526
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,269
(TROY CHUCKLING)
<i>Then I realized</i>

527
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,605
<i>I was in</i>
<i>an actual bathroom.</i>

528
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:35,902
Uh, no offense,
but this material

529
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,737
seems pretty specific
to your apartment.

530
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,906
I don't think it'll work
at an open mic.

531
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,080
<i>Y'all ever notice</i>
<i>the difference</i>

532
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:49,207
<i>between me and Troy</i>
<i>brushing our teeth?</i>

533
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,292
<i>I brush my teeth</i>
<i>like this.</i>

534
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,754
<i>Troy brushes his teeth</i>
<i>like this.</i>

535
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:57,256
(CHUCKLING) I do!

536
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,633
I do! I brush my teeth
just like that.

537
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,177
<i>Now you know</i>
<i>what I'm gonna</i>
<i>talk about next.</i>

538
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:02,720
ABED: <i> Toaster oven!</i>
Toaster oven!

539
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:03,679
It's from his album.
