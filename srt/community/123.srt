00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,245
Oh, hi.
Hey, how's it going?

358
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,414
You still
have some paint.

359
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:44,791
Oh, thanks.

360
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,043
Um, I was thinking--
You don't have to.

361
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,711
It didn't happen.

362
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,588
It's not a mistake.
Just that it didn't happen.

363
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:51,965
It was a crazy night
of paintball.

364
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,382
Exactly. Tension relieving.

365
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,593
Absolutely. No need
to mention it to anyone.

366
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:57,344
Right, no big deal.
Nothing's changed.

367

Something's changed.

368
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:04,184
Oh, Abed. Crazy Abed.

369
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,062
No, something's different now.

370
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:09,065
Me? I'm sporting a man-thong.
Maybe.

371
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:13,193
Or maybe it's that I
have emerged victorious

372
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,947
with a priority registration
form.

373
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:19,033
Oh!
Well done, Jeff.

next semester,
if anybody asks, you have gout.

379

Do you mind walking with a limp?
Mm.

380
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:38,011
Thank you, Jeffrey.
Look, Annie.

381
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:41,681
Wow, I didn't see that coming.
Neither did I.

382
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,265
So no one feels it?

383
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,059
No one senses anything's
different?

384
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,978
Nope.
Not at all.
