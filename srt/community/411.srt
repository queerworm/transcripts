1
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:04,588
Come on, guys.
I got class in 15 minutes.

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,423
This should not be
that difficult.

3
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:08,884
We just need to figure out
an idea for our final
history project.

4
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:10,427
What we need
to figure out

5
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:12,930
is Greendale's obsession
with group assignments.

6
00:00:12,972 --> 00:00:14,515
(SCOFFS)
Classic herd mentality.

7
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:16,016
All right,
Britta doesn't have one.
Who else?

8
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:19,895
I've been told
I look like a Kennedy.

9
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:21,689
Nope, not an idea.
That's a statement.

10
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,106
Anyone not on medication?

11
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,650
Jeff, we have
to take this seriously.

12
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:27,903
This assignment?
This, we have
to take seriously?

13
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:30,197
"Pick any moment
from history
and tell me about it.

14
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:32,449
"Be as creative as you want.
Or not. I don't care.

15
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:33,993
"Professor Cornwaaa..."

16
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,202
He didn't even finish
signing his name.

17
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:37,496
Okay, yes,
he phoned this one in

18
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,999
but my run at valedictorian
is in jeopardy.

19
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,917
As is mine.
As is Shirley's.

20
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:43,836
And I just took one
for the team

21
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:45,587
by accepting that C+
on our last history paper.

22
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,673
As did I.
As did Shirley.

23
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:49,048
So I'd think you'd want
to rise to the occasion

24
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,010
and help get me
back on top.
Or me.

25
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,095
Shirley, I'm speaking
for both you and me.

26
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,682
Then, you might want to teach
your mouth how to say
"we," "our," and "us."

27
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,478
I've been told
I look like a Kennedy.

28
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,064
Nope, still just
a random statement,
and still useless.

29
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,482
Okay.
How about this?

30
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:07,902
We do a series of banners...
Great, it's settled.

31
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:09,945
You don't even know
what I'm going to say!
Don't need to.

32
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,113
Tomorrow is Friday,
and I have no intention
of being here late.

33
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,033
Your banner thing
sounds doable.

34
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,618
And this assignment?
Passable, so passable.

35
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,079
And passable
assures my graduation,

36
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,248
so we are doing doable
and passable.

37
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:24,835
Uh, speaking of tomorrow,
Troy and Britta,

38
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:27,796
have you decided what
you're gonna do for
your one-year anniversary?

39
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,049
BOTH: Of?

40
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:31,967
Your first date?

41
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,844
Oh! Yeah! (SCOFFS)
Da-doy.

42
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:35,971
That was a test,
and you failed.
I was just kidding.

43
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:37,639
You guys are dating?
Man!

44
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:39,934
Somebody's sure
working her way
around the table.

45
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:41,852
Aren't you?

46
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:43,938
Well, you should really
do something special.

47
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,773
Something romantic.
Mmm-hmm.

48
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,108
Like go back
to <i> Senor</i> Kevin's for lunch,
where it all began.

49
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,860
(GIGGLES)

50
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:52,071
Yeah, sure.
We could do that.

51
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,739
Sure,
that sounds fun.

52
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,116
Speaking of anniversaries,

53
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:57,743
it is the third anniversary

54
00:01:57,785 --> 00:02:00,037
of me and Abed
watching <i> Freaky Friday</i>
for the first time.

55
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,832
BOTH: Oh!
That, you remember?

56
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:06,334
Movie Trolley is having
an "end of the video store
chain industry" sale,

57
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,253
so I got you a six-pack
of body switching movies

58
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:09,880
and a two-year-old box
of Raisinets,

59
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:12,049
all for under five bucks.
Whoo!

60
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,093

(STILTED) Oh, Troy,
you are so thoughtful.

67
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,775
I wish I had the capacity
for sentimentality
like you do.

68
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:33,320
(STILTED) Me?
I wish I was more like you.

69
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,323
No emotional hang-ups,
endless cool adventures.

70
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:37,699
You have it so easy.

71
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,493
No, you do, Troy.

72
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,161
No, you do, Abed.

73
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:44,164

that would work.

Yes. That would be this day.

Look, I know that
it was awkward yesterday.

90
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:52,399
They pointed it out
and we didn't remember
but... (SCOFFS)

91
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,942
that doesn't mean
that we should
feel pressure

92
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,028
to make some big deal
out of it, right?

No, I'm looking
forward to it.

Super looking
forward to it.
I'm just saying...

95
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:03,243
Yeah.

when we faked a body switching
thing and it didn't work?

Well, now,
it's actually worked.

Huh.

Okay,
so we're telling the story

109

of the American Revolution
through banners.

00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,207
Everyone is responsible
for one.

111
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:52,584
To maximize efficiency,
I've designated areas:

112
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,254
Colored pencils and markers,
paints, puffy paint...

113
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,338
Yes,
there's a difference.

114
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,883
Decoupage and glitter and...

115
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,470
This is the approval station,

116
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,014
where Shirley and I
will decide whether
you have to start over or not.

117
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:09,517
Annie, remember.
We're doing doable
and passable.

to help us...

by Leonard?

Yes, we slipped
below Leonard,

124
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:27,494
but Annie and I are
a close three and two,

Annie is the three.

126

we pretended to
switch bodies yesterday?

Unfortunately,
yes, dorks.

137
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,234
Well, it really happened.
I'm actually Abed.

138
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:01,236
And I'm actually Troy.

139
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,071
All right.
I don't care who's who.

and that's all I need

to complete
this passable project
in a doable amount of time.

00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:11,121
Wish we could help, Jeff,
but in order to switch back,

143
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:12,956
we have to recreate
the exact moment
that all this happened,

144
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:14,958
but the DVD is missing.
Of course it is.

145
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,375
So now,
I have to find it

146
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:17,585
while Troy goes on
an anniversary date
with Britta.

00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,091
How about you make
a banner as Troy

150
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,509
and you make
a banner as Abed,

151
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:25,844
and we'll be done
within the hour.

152
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,138
Uh, per banner,
if we're lucky.

153
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,806
And that's
if we want an A.

154
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,558
Okay, you two
need to let go
of the pressure

155
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,310
you're putting
on this project
to get an A.

to be number one!

Sorry.

159
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,984
I have to go talk to Troy.

160
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:43,111
Yes, please.

161
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,780
Tell your boyfriend
and his boyfriend
that playtime is over.

Annie, Shirley, go find out
what's keeping Leonard on top.

163
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,410
And Abed won't switch back
until we get that DVD.
I'll deal with that.

164
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,080
And then,
we are meeting back here

165
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,873
and getting up
into some puffy paint

166
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,958
and doing our doable,
passable banners!

to do?

Or don't.

170
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:02,839
I'm on it.

171
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,507
Wait, Troy!

172
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,467
I'm Abed.
Oh, right.

173
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,930
Uh, "Troy," could you
please excuse us?

174
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,974
You were weird this morning,
and now, well, weirder.

175
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,517
Are we still on
for <i> Senor</i> Kevin's

176
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,686
or are you guys doing
this whole switchy thing?

177
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,563
Actually, he's kind of
going through some stuff.

178
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,149
Oh.

179
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,110
Is he having some issues
that he's having trouble
dealing with?

180
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:27,364
Yeah, he kind of needs this,
so he's really laying into it.

181
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:31,285
Oh, so he might need
an almost therapist.

182
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,453
Perhaps I'll pencil him in
for a session,

183
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:36,456
you know,
after my date with Troy.

184
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,625
See you later, Abed.

185
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:42,879
Dean, I need you.

186
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,340
(GASPS) It's happening.
Shut the door.

187
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,175
What?
Hmm?

188
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:50,220
Dean, I need you
to give this DVD
to Troy and Abed.

189
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:51,805
Oh, I love those movies!

190
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:54,599
They should make more of them.
They're a timeless tale.

191
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:55,850
Why can't you
give it to them?

192
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,936
Troy and Abed think
they switched bodies

193
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,854
while holding
onto a <i> Freaky Friday</i> DVD,

194
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:03,024
which, of course,
is now mysteriously missing,

195
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,692
and they can't switch back
until they find it.

196
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,028
Now, I'd give them
this one myself,

197
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,697
but they'll think
that I bought it,
which I did.

198
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,199
Wait.

199
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,533
How did they switch bodies?

200
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,245
(SCOFFS) Well, they held
onto the DVD and said...

201
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,247
BOTH: I wish I could
switch places with you
for just one day.

202
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:18,539
Oh! Oh!

203
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,917
Ah! (GASPS)

204
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:23,795
Sorry. Routine
light switch check.

205
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,422
That is not a thing!

206
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:27,882
What?

207
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,510
(DEEP, AS JEFF)
Oh, you've got
to be kidding me.

208
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,304
I'm you?

209
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:35,556
What?
No! You're not.

210
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,643
Of course.
It's fricking Friday.

211
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,812
There's no justification
to be made,

212
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,648
because it can't happen,
weirdo.

213
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,942
Whatever, Dean.
Now, please leave your office

214
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:49,570
so I can start
to work on your weird body
that I'm now stuck in!

215
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,408
You're not even
holding a phone!

216
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:00,081
So, Troy,
how's Abed coping?

217
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:02,750
I mean,
with his day in your body?

218
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,253
You'd have to ask him.
I, for one, am freaked.

219
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:06,629
Look at his arms and legs.

220
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,882
He's like
the pick-up sticks
of people.

221
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:12,552
Do you think he's trying
to hide from something
he's not understanding?

222
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,595
If you're worried about Abed,
you should talk to him.

223
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,182
Right.
I should talk to him.

224
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:21,019
Well, well, well.
John McLame.

225
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,104
Never thought
I'd see your face again.

226
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,772
Back for more, huh?

227
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,607
I'm sorry,
back for what?

228
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,109
Punishment.

229
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,820
Last time I saw you,
you got your panties
all in a wad

230
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:34,615
'cause I said <i> Die Hard</i>
was a suckfest of a movie.

231
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,993
(FORCED) Wait, what?
You hate <i> Die Hard?</i>

232
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,786
That sounds insane to me.

233
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,163
It is,
without a doubt,

234
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,874
the most unnecessary movie
ever made.

235
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,336
I'm not who you think
I am, man.

236
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:48,880
What else do you hate
about the movie?

237
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:52,175
'Cause I would love to hear
all of your opinions.

238
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:55,429
(LAUGHING) Well, I mean,
where to even start?

239
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,680
It's riddled with plot holes.
There's no logic to it.

240
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:01,726
I would rather
watch a napkin sit
and do nothing all day

241
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:06,314
than to even
endure the trailer
for <i> Die Hard!</i>

242
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,608
Wow, that's hatred.

243
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,780
Babe, we should order.

244
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,616
I'm both starving
and another word
for wanting food.

245
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,953
Troy!

246
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,496
Oh, thank God,
you've come to your senses.

247
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:22,747
You answered to Troy.

248
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,874
We're in public.
I have to. I'm Abed.

249
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,209
Of course you are.

250
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:30,213
Well, Abed, I found the DVD.
You can switch back now.

251
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:32,299
(CHUCKLES) Nice try.
That's the remake.

252
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,050
In the original,
the mom and daughter
simply exclaimed,

253
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:35,635
"I wish I could
switch places with you
for just one day."

254
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:36,761
Like we did.

255
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,138
In that one,
there's a magic
fortune cookie.

256
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,973
Oh, I always wondered
what the differences were.

257
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,809
Listen, why don't
I pitch you a remake
of a remake,

258
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,437
where my magic mouth
tells you drop the act

259
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,314
because Abed
isn't even here.

260
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,856
Then, you cough up the DVD

261
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,858
and we go tell Abed
you're back
in your own bodies,

262
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,861
so we can go do doable
and passable banners.

263
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,489
First,
that's a terrible movie.

264
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,739
Second, I understand
why you're frustrated,

265
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,575
it's in your nature,
but this is happening.

266
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:00,743
This happened.
So, unless we find
that DVD...

267
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,203
Oh, no,
let's go find this DVD.

268
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:04,247
By all means,
let's waste more
of my life.

269
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,500
Now, we were the last ones
to leave the study room
last night.

270
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,542
Maybe one of
the janitors took it.

271
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,169
Great.
Let's go find that janitor.

272
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,587
Maybe you can
switch bodies with him,

273
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:11,921
or maybe
with his magic mop...

274
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:13,756
Stop pitching.
It's not your thing.

275
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,092
You're right,
that's ridiculous,
unlike what we're doing.

276
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:17,427
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

277
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,138
Dean?

278
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,098
Yeah, come in.

279
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,683
I'd stop what I'm doing,
but then I'd be
depriving you of the view.

280
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,234
You're welcome.
What's up?

281
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:35,445
Um, is this a bad time?

282
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:37,572
Uh, I'm in Greendale,
stuck in the body

283
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,240
of a man who could be
Gollum's shadow,

284
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,951
so yeah,
I'd say it's half past suck.

285
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,620
(LAUGHS) Totally.

286
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,788
"Half past suck."
That's funny.

287
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,124
Okay.
That's creepy.

288
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:50,043
Uh, Dean.

289
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,878
We're losing to Leonard
in the race of valedictorian,

290
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,754
and we were wondering
if we could take a peek

291
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,632
at his transcripts to see
how that is even possible.

292
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:57,758
Are you serious?
Mmm.

293
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,386
You mean
put my integrity
on the line?

294
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,513
You want me
to jeopardize
the very reputation

295
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:04,391
of this school
that I've spent
so long protecting?

296
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,976
You're right.
We're sorry.

297
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,479
And that is what
I would be saying
if I gave a crap.

298
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,064
Awesome!

299
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,820
Ah, here's the answer.

300
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:21,449
Back in 1968,
Leonard got an A in
rotary phone maintenance.

301
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:24,327
Since then, he's been taking
every other class pass/fail

302
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,287
to keep a perfect GPA.

303
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:27,664
Well, what does this mean?

304
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:30,083
It means we're taking
an old man down.

305
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,292
(GASPS) Ooh.

306
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,003
You're welcome.

307
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,464
What is wrong with you?

308
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:37,840
I don't know.

309
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,594
How's your bean burrito?

310
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:42,887
Good. Thank you
for ordering for me.

311
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,431
I know
what you always get.

312
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,224
Yeah, you know me so well.

313
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,850
I know a lot about you.

314
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,185
I know you grind
your teeth at night,
it keeps me up.

315
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:50,978
I know about your tattoo.
Which one?

316
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,105
The Greenpeace one
you haven't gotten yet

317
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,982
because you're afraid
of needles.

318
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,984
Did Troy tell you
these things?

319
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,861
I am Troy.

320
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,697
Well,
it must upset Abed

321
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:03,617
to hear all of this
relationship talk.

322
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:06,035
He doesn't seem to care.
Maybe.

323
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:08,955
But maybe he doesn't like
talking to you about us.

324
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,332
I could see that
causing him to act out.

325
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:12,667
Nah, I don't see that.

326
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,294
I don't think
he's that invested in us.

327
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,045
But he talks to you
about us.

328
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,213
I talk to him.

329
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:22,385
What do you say
when you talk to him
about us?

330
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,512
Do you tell him
that things are good?

331
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:27,307
I don't know.
Are they?

332
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,392
Well, what you think?
Well...

333
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:32,562
I guess I wonder
why we didn't
remember our anniversary.

334
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:34,981
Not everybody's Annie.
No, but I don't know.

335
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,191
Seems like, you know,
that would be special to us,

336
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,402
like, especially
if things were good.

337
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:40,570
Something we'd want
to celebrate.

338
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,071
Well, we are.

339
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:43,948
Are we?

340
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,035
(LAUGHTER)
Yes, Lord Brickell,

341
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,829
I was indeed
down by the stables.

342
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,001
Damn, man.
You ever heard of knocking?

343
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,003
Yup, just heard it,
when I did it a second ago.

344
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,255
They've seen too much!
Let's kill them!

345
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:01,048
Stand down,
Crazy Schmidt.

346
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,092
What we're doing here
is none of their business.

347
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:04,843
We're having
Murder Mystery Night
during the day.

348
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,929
I was fine with
"none of your business."

349
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,515
We're looking
for a <i> Freaky Friday</i> DVD.

350
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,100
Oh, I love those movies.
They should make
more of those...

351
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:13,894
Nope. We left it
in study room "F"
last night.

352
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,563
Well, everything we find
goes straight to
the Lost and Found.

353
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,106
Great, show us.

354
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:19,484
And the "wasting my life" tour
continues.

355
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:22,195
Leonard!

356
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,863
We just looked
at your transcript.

357
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,826
I knew this day would come.
I'm outta here.

358
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,288
There you go.
My work here is done.

359
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,914
You're one and two again.

360
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,710
Now, you can direct
your anger and
resentment at each other.

361
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:37,752
Congrats.

362
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,420
Classic wrap-up.

363
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:40,505
Shut up, Leonard!

364
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:41,881
I've got a picture
of your old nose!

365
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,966
It was a lateral move!
Dean!

366
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,677
(TURNED ON) Dean.
Annie.

367
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,512
Why is this happening?

368
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:53,309
Holy Makes-Complete-
Sense-At-This-School!

369
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:55,269
FYI, one of these piles
is load-bearing,

370
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,896
so, uh, yeah,
watch that.

371
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:58,732
Jeez.

372
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,777
This is gonna be harder
than I thought.

373
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:03,862
This DVD isn't
gonna find itself.

374
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,113
And neither are we, Troy,

375
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,408
because it's not in here,
and you know that.

376
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,992
This is dumb.

377
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,286
Why are you
so committed to this bit?

378
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,664
If you're really
a friend to Abed, to me,

379
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:16,541
then you'll end it, now.

380
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,042
Sorry.

381
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,628
I have to keep
going, for Troy.

382
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,714
You don't have
to dig through
all this stuff. I will.

383
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,257
I know
it isn't your problem.

384
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,885
I'm just glad I'm here.

385
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,220
This is the sweeter end
of the deal.

386
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:32,223
Troy still has to go
on his date with Britta.

387
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:35,017
I don't understand
this whole relationship thing

388
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,728
or why Troy would even
want to be in one.

389
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,608
How long have you
felt this way?

390
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,359
Or at least,

391
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,945
how long have you
been talking to Abed
about this?

392
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:49,073
Not that long.

393
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,242
It's more lately,
I guess.

394
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,077
It's felt different,

395
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,871
like we're working at it
too hard.

396
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:56,790
And he doesn't think
it should be.

397
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,543
It should be easy,
but he says it isn't.

398
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,921
It feels like
we're just going
through the motions.

399
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:06,966
Because he's afraid
if he doesn't, it just ends.
Then what?

400
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,092
What if they're not
friends anymore?

401
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,971
He'd hate that.
He'd hate himself.

402
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,055
I don't want to lose
what we had.

403
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,767
So he's here,
at this point,

404
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,310
not knowing
how to talk to her,

405
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,979
not knowing how to tell her
that he wants to break up.

406
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,983
Wait, are you
breaking up with me?

407
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:27,278
I think so?

408
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,535
I'm sorry, Jeff.

409
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:37,079
I shouldn't have
brought you down here,
into any of this.

410
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,165
Especially for a bit.
I know you don't
respect them.

411
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,250
That's true. They're dumb,
and I stand by that,

412
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,169
but committing to them isn't.

413
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,464
I wish I had the courage
to commit to a bit
like you, Abed,

414
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,758
or to a relationship,
like Troy.

415
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,760
Committing is hard,

416
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:52,971
because we're all scared
of what happens

417
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,515
when we find out
we committed
to the wrong thing,

418
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:59,894
but there's no shame
in what Troy's done.

419
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:03,063
He put himself out there
and he really tried,

420
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,985
and that proves he cares.

421
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,029
That said,
and as hard
as it may seem,

422
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:13,700
right now, Troy needs
to show he cares.

423
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:18,204
He needs to put
himself out there
and own how he feels.

424
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,790
That proves he's a man.

425
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:25,712
So...

426
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,089
Yeah, I don't think
this is the way

427
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,175
either of us
thought this would go.

428
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:34,094
No, I can't say
that I did.

429
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:38,057
I mean, not this,
not us here.

430
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,060
(SIGHS)

431
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:46,273
But I can say that
whenever you guys switch back
to your original bodies,

432
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:51,070
I want to thank Abed
for being such a good friend
to both of us.

433
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,279
Troy, wait.

434
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,199
Don't do it like this.

435
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,827
I understand why
you had to go high concept,
because you're scared,

436
00:17:57,869 --> 00:17:59,078
but Britta deserves better.

437
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,081
Troy, it's time.

438
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,462
BOTH: I wish
I had my own body back!

439
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,381
(BABBLING GIBBERISH)

440
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,553
Sorry, routine
light switch check.

441
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:16,763
(BABBLING CONTINUES)

442
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,310
Oh.
Hmm.

443
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:32,403
Oh, I've been meaning
to see this.

444
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:35,114
First, the easiest part,
because it's the most obvious.

445
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:38,409
I'm sorry.

446
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,454
I think I proved today
that I'm not ready for this.

447
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:44,082
I wanted it to work.
I did.

448
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,584
I care about you so much,

449
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,127
and I love
being around you.

450
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,839
I just think I'm better
as your friend,

451
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,302
because that I know
I can be good at.

452
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,768
So I'm number two again,
which is what it is.

453
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,562
But, you know,
if I'm not going
to be valedictorian,

454
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:07,688
I'm glad it will be you.

455
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,231
Mmm, me too.

456
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,068
You mean,
you hope it's me
if it's not you,

457
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,903
or that you're glad
it's you?

458
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:16,280
Yes.

459
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:17,573
Thanks for everything
you did for me today.

460
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,075
I'm sorry
I pulled you into it.

461
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:21,119
That was my problem,
not yours.

462
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,162
It's the best way
someone's ever
woken me up in my life.

463
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,372
How was lunch?

464
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,375
It was good.
It really was.

465
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,877
I'll tell you
about it later.

466
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,504
Oh, there you are.

467
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,630
I got bored waiting,

468
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,966
so I went ahead
and did our whole project.

469
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:37,093
(CHUCKLES)
Pierce, no offense,

470
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:39,137
but banners
are kind of my...

471
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,805
Oh.

472
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:43,766
Holy Makes-No-
Sense-Whatsoever.

473
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:46,185
PIERCE: Whole thing
took 25 minutes tops.

474
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,355
ALL: Huh.

475
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,524
Early weekend?
Early weekend?
Early weekend?

476
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,401
Guys, I need to apologize
for my behavior today.

477
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,529
When I switched bodies
with Jeffrey...
Nope.

478
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,156
I thought I knew
what it would be like

479
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,740
to have Jeffrey
inside of me...

480
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,701
That did not happen.
...but as it turns out,

481
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,078
having Jeffrey
inside of me...
Nope again.

482
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,872
...only brought out
the worst in me.

483
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,916
Which is to say,
having Jeffrey
inside of me...

484
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,543
No one was
inside of anyone!

485
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,669
...was wrong...

486
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,381
...to have Jeffrey
inside of me.
Shut up!

487
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,091
So I'm sorry.

488
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,759
Now, if you'll excuse me,

489
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,761
I scolded Leonard today,

490
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:23,139
and according
to Greendale bylaws,

491
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:26,308
I now have to grant him
three wishes.

492
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,603
Um, we need to get scolded
by the dean immediately.

493
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,855
SHIRLEY: Mmm-hmm.

494
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,790
Oh, man. Football is "frun."
That is an interest I have.

495
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:53,252
Also, plumbing
and air conditioning
are things I think about.

496
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,921
(LAUGHS)

497
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,547
Come on, man.
What are we...
What's happening?

498
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,382
I couldn't...
I'm sorry, keep rolling.

499
00:20:58,424 --> 00:20:59,759
Okay. Come on.

500
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,968
Feetball is...
(LAUGHS)

501
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:01,886
"Feetball"?
"Feetball"!

502
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,596
Did I say...
Dorks!

503
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,973
Stop doing outtakes.
You switched bodies
last week.

504
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,892
Hey, guys,
I just want to apologize...

505
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,769
(LAUGHS)

506
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,729
Oh, my God!
Hey, Dean, walk much?

507
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:15,315
Am I right? (LAUGHING)
I'm sorry, I never do this.

508
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,609
Dean, we stopped
doing outtakes.

509
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,652
Oh, okay.
Yeah, we did that.

510
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:21,155
Oh, no worries.
Thanks for including me. Okay.

511
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,741
Whoa!
(CHUCKLES)

512
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,492
No? Still not doing it?
Okay.
