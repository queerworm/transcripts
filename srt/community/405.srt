00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:35,937
We need to do
a prison break.

171
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,526
(SIGHS)

172
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,195
Happy Thanksgiving?

173
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:45,030
You really "you'd"
this one, huh?

174
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,157
Okay, yes, I meddled
against your wishes,

175
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,035
and yes,
I got this address
from the Dean, but hey.

176
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,704
You had a moment of doubt,
and here I am to help you
through it.

177
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,123
Psychology tells us
there are no accidents.

178
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,833
Oh, really?
What about car accidents,

179
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,710
Tara Reid,
or the Hindenburg?

180
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,419
Here goes nothing.

181
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:05,926
Hello, William.

182
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:15,727
So, uh, how about we make
a couple of ground rules?

183
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:16,937
Actually,
that sounds good.

184
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,772
Okay.
No hugs.

185
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,523
Wouldn't want one.
No apologies.

186
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,276
Wouldn't accept one.
No calling you "Dad."

187
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,152
No expectations.
No BS.

188
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:25,237
Drink?
Scotch.

189
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,780
Eighteen?
Neat.

190
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,115
I just want to acknowledge

191
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,491
that there are
a lot of emotions
flowing right now,

192
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,412
and you two are probably
feeling a strong impulse

193
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,955
to sleep with each other,

194
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,457
and hey, that's normal.

195
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:40,210
Wow.
I'll get the drinks.

196
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,505
So, how about that?
No muss, no fuss.

197
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:47,426
Jeff, I urge you not to run
from the muss and fuss.

198
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,760
Hi.

199
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:51,596
Hi.

200
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,765
You must be
my half-brother.

201
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,810
Oh, your hands
are so much bigger
than mine.

202
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,395
Your nail beds are perfect.

203
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:00,105
I can't do it.
I can't.

204
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,649
Oh, God.
Oh, it's coming up.

205
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,858
When I get upset,
I vomit.

206
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,611
Oh, I see you've
met Willy Junior.

207
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:09,530
You said he wasn't
going to replace me.

208
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,200
He's the Schwarzenegger.
I'm the DeVito.

209
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,744
I get it.
(LAUGHS)

210
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:17,080
Okay, fellas,
let's get right into it.

211
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,666
I think the big question
on everyone's mind is,

212
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,128
why don't I go
help Willy Junior?

213
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,421
Hmm?

214
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,592
ABED:
<i>One thing was clear to me</i>
<i>and the rest of the crew.</i>

215
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,053
<i>Bennett lockup was not</i>
<i>where we belonged.</i>

216
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,139
<i>We belonged in the sun,</i>
<i>with the wind in our hair,</i>

217
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,641
<i>or maybe at a Bennigan's,</i>
<i>enjoying a Turkey O'Toole.</i>

218
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,352
We should tunnel out.

219
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:39,894
Abed,
Shirley is our friend,

220
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,229
and we're guests
in her home.

221
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,856
We need a plan
that won't hurt
her feelings,

222
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,732
or damage her property.

223
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,985
Definitely don't look
behind that poster, then.

224
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,487
I could pretend
to have a stroke.

225
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,864
Do a gibberish
foreign language.

226
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,991
What if I did
a gibberish foreign
language like <i> Star Wars?</i>

227
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,161
You'd like that, I bet.
Dick.

228
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,872
Look, I'm sure
we'll figure out
a way out of here.

229
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,916
What's important
right now is that
we stick together.

230
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,085
Yeah.
Oh, there you are.

231
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,545
Who wants
a pre-dinner snack?

232
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,130
(GROANS)
Oh!

233
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,631
Oh, pumpkin,
what's wrong?

234
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,843
Oh, it's too embarrassing

235
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,221
to talk about in front
of the guys, know what
I mean, girlfriend?

236
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:17,724
Oh, sweetie.
Do you have
your monthly shame?

237
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,559
SHIRLEY:
Do you want to lie down
in Elijah's room?

238
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,978
Oh, I don't think
that's going to cut it.

239
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,898
I probably need to go home
and call Dr. Collins.
It's that bad.

240
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,567
Oh, well, you know,
my sister-in-law's
a gynecologist,

241
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,152
and she's right
in the other room.

242
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,988
There's no need to bother
your doctor on a holiday.

243
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,199
Go ahead.
Mmm-hmm.

244
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,410
ABED: <i> I'd like to tell you</i>
<i>Annie avoided Shirley's</i>
<i>doctor sister-in-law,</i>

245
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,495
<i>but this ain't no fairy tale.</i>

246
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:39,579
<i>This is Thanksgiving.</i>

247
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,749
WILLIAM:
Let's see, what else?

248
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,044
You've got some diabetes,
on my mother's side.

249
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,379
Good to know.

250
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:50,215
I like your hair.
The presence of it,
I mean.

251
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:53,427
So I have a question,

252
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,345
and it's been weighing
on me pretty heavily.

253
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:58,056
At your age,
in the bedroom...

254
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,476
Oh, yeah.
It's all good.

255
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,353
Yeah?
Real good.

256
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:06,189
Look at them.
Bonding.

257
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,733
Probably laughing
'cause I can't grow a beard.

258
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,444
(SNAP FINGERS)
I have an idea.

259
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:14,030
Why don't we use
these dinner rolls
to do some "roll" play?

260
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,949
(CHUCKLES)
I see what I did there.

261
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,742
Okay.

262
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,328
This roll,
this is me.

263
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,207
He's crying.
Good.

264
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,833
That's really good.

265
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,378
So, uh,
what do you do?

266
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,047
I'm a lawyer who faked
a Bachelor's degree

267
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,550
and practiced Law
for seven years
before I got caught.

268
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:35,093
(LAUGHS)

269
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,719
I like your hustle.

270
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:40,474
Reminds me of the summer
I was Ralph Lauren
out in St. Tropez.

271
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,601
'83, I'm on a boat
with, uh...

272
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:44,644
Damn it, Willy!

273
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,646
I'm expressing.
Knock it off.

274
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:49,983
Why can't you just
swallow it, like any
normal person?

275
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,986
Oh! Oh, right.
Like your new son.

276
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:56,531
Like Mister... (STAMMERS)
Mister I've Got My Shirt...

277
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,283
I don't know a lot
of personal details
about you yet.

278
00:10:58,325 --> 00:10:59,493
Well, my name's Jeff.

279
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:02,454
Don't help me,
Mr. Helper Guy.

280
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:04,164
First mom dies,
now this?

281
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,832
Hey, she died
20 years ago, Willy.

282
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,459
He keeps singing
the same old song.

283
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:10,545
Wow.
She died on you.

284
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,172
Here I thought
you'd become
Father of the Year,

285
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,672
but you just got stuck.

286
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,091
Yeah, well, look,
I don't have to tell you

287
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,010
I'm not a natural caretaker,

288
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:20,555
but with Willy,
you know, I...
I checked all the boxes,

289
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,183
and he still turned out
softer than wet cheese.

290
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,185
I don't get it.

291
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:28,480
He keeps saying
he's going to move out
next week, since '03.

292
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,607
Oh, man, I couldn't
wait to get out.

293
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:31,983
I got my own place
when I was 18.

294
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,901
I was the same way.
(CHUCKLES)

295
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,531
So who's ready to eat?

296
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,783
Jeff, you care
to carve the turkey?

297
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,077
I knew it!
You love him
more than me.

298
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,414
I'll show you.
I'll run away.

299
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:49,376
Oh, please.
Hey, be my guest.

300
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,711
You run away,
and I'm going to sleep
like a baby tonight.

Oh, now, I'm sorry
you guys had to see that,

303
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,302
but maybe you could
shrink his head,

304
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,221
since you're here
for some reason.

305
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:04,516
Yes.
I can do this.

306
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:07,227

where you're hurt!

now he's getting up.

asked to see the scar,

I didn't want
to get found out,

00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:35,448
so I took mom's scissors,
and I made one.

It hurt like hell,
but it was worth it.

Because I got 17 cards,

466
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,123

them in a box

00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,717
So pretty.
JEFF: Sit, sit, sit.

507
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,844
ABED: <i> We never got</i>
<i>to do a</i> Shawshank <i> homage,</i>

508
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:22,055
<i>not the way I wanted to.</i>

509
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:24,015
<i>Maybe the hardest prisons</i>
<i>to break out of</i>

510
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,767
<i>are the ones without locks.</i>

511
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,936
<i>Wait, that doesn't</i>
<i>make any sense.</i>

512
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,772
<i>After that day,</i>
<i>Jeff seemed like</i>
<i>a man unburdened.</i>

513
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:33,566
<i>He told me about</i>
<i>seeing his father again,</i>

514
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,484
<i>about how leaving there</i>
<i>felt like breaking free</i>

515
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,403
<i>of an emotional prison</i>
<i>he'd been in for years.</i>

516
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,488
<i>Something about</i>
<i>shackles on his heart?</i>

517
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,199
<i>To be honest,</i>
<i>I stopped listening.</i>

518
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,825
<i>I was thinking</i>
<i>about Christmas.</i>

519
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,035
<i>I hope we do</i> Die Hard.

520
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,745
<i>I hope it's in a restaurant.</i>

521
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,872
<i>I hope it lays out as cleanly</i>
<i>as it does in my dreams.</i>

522
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,373
<i>I hope it's cool.</i>

523
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:50,541
<i>Cool, cool, cool.</i>

524
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,043
Cheers.
Cheers.

525
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,420
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone,
including you, Dean.

(HUMMING JAZZY TUNE)

527
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,386
Hey.

528
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,267
(HUMMING)

529
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:13,189
Hmm.

530
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:15,024
(HUMMING)

531
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,280
Oh, my.

532
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:26,202
I'll have to remember
this for next year.

533
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:27,286
Mmm-hmm.
