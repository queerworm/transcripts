00:00:01,168 --> 00:00:03,963
So cellular mitosis
is what?

00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,130

3
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:06,966
Wrong, and stop
guessing that.

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,467
Annie.
I'm worried
about Abed.

5
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:10,177
He hasn't
left the apartment
since Troy moved out.

6
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:12,137
He won't even play
in the Dreamatorium.

7
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,221
Sorry, not "play."

retaking biology all summer,

10
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:20,061
and if I don't
pass this final,
it was for nothing.

11
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,522
Can we stay on target?

12
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:23,774

"sexy construction worker"?

13

ALL: Ooh!
Stay... Stay on target.

00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:30,197

because I'm building
to big news.

its agreement with Greendale,

16
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:34,785
and the restaurant
I've chosen

17
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:38,956
to occupy
the cafeteria kiosk is...

18
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:41,458

(ALL CHEERING)

19
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,836
I just need one of you
to sign this

20
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:45,546
as the official owner
of the business.

21
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,506
Ooh,
we should both sign it,
we're 50-50 partners.

22
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,842
But there's
only one dotted line
on the form, so...

23
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:51,468
Oh, well, Pierce can...
Me.

24
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,678
Hey!
I paid for it.

25
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,013
Well, there'd be no "it"
to pay for

26
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,472
if I hadn't done
all the work.

27

is becoming a mountain.

an alpine costume.

you'd try to box me out

Hawthorne Wipes did.

letting you guilt me

32

call yourself the owner
of my company.

No.

I am here to replace
my fake bachelor's

36

to my life as a lawyer.

their interests.

Today is Abed's
first therapy session.

45

He's been feeling
extra vulnerable lately

to the air conditioning
repair school,

47
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:44,980
so he's finally
gonna let me practice
my psych skills on him.

of our history.

that I once thought

that this might be me.

that it's you.

You are
the true repairman, Troy.

air conditioners,

who fix them.

as inner dialogue.

let Britta fix you, right?

you're broken,

if I talk to Britta.

173
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:21,691
Oy-yay, oy-yay,

Craig Pelton presiding.

174
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:25,153
(LAUGHING) First off,
there's one decision

175
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,322
I'll need
your help making.

176
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,824
<i>Judging Amy</i>
or <i> Judge Judy?</i>

177
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,160
You say your name
is Evil Abed,

178
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:35,080
which does not throw me,
because I'm a therapist.

179
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:36,664
So let's talk
about evil.

180
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:43,504
You know what?
Maybe I should talk
to Good Abed instead.

181
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,590
Where I come from,
his name is Lame Abed.

182
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,176
And you come from...
The darkest timeline.

183
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,844
You might call it
the Britta of timelines,

184
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,430
where everything
is the worst.

185
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,141
Jeff has one arm there.
Annie shot Pierce.
Troy can't speak...

186
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,892
Ah! Now we're
getting somewhere.

187
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,645
I think Lame Abed
sent you to talk

188
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:01,189
because you're
more equipped
to deal with fear.

189
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,233
That's the lame way
of seeing it, yes.

190
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,277
Here's the truth.

191
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,903
I've crossed
into your dark timeline,

192
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:07,988
and now I'm going
to darken it.

193
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,530
How?

194
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:10,907
Tell me about
your parents, Britta.

195
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:14,286
Um... No?

196
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,415
Barnes, you should be
in the chapel.

197
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:20,083
We lost a great
man today.

198
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,002
Yeah, he was the best,
wasn't he?

199
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,253
That's why
I don't understand

200
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,256
how he could rupture
a Freon line.

201
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:27,466
That's kind of
a rookie mistake.

202
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,426
I'm sure it was just
a faulty valve.

as Vice Dean,

204
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,137
I'm gonna have them
all replaced.

205
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,763
So you're
Vice Dean now?

206
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,640
Why the sudden interest
in air conditioning repair?

207
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:36,599
I thought you missed
your friends.

208
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,685
I do.
Then go be with them.

209
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,354
I'm releasing you.

210
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,105
But you...
Good-bye, Troy.

211
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:50,447
Miss Edison,
do you recognize
the baby in that picture?

212
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:52,449
That's Shirley's baby Ben.

213
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:55,660
Would you think less
of Shirley Bennett

214
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:59,414
if she offered
to sell Ben on Craigslist

215
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,624
for a chance
to bump it with Denzel?

216
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,626
That was a joke
for my cousin.

217
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,670
Damn those Facebook
privacy settings.

218
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,130
Jeff, do something.
He's got nothing.

219
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,589
I'm sure she didn't
mean that.

220
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:12,802
Or perhaps she doesn't
even love that baby,

221
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:16,556
because she spent
most of last year
not even knowing

222
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,517
who the father is.
Objection.

you were gonna go easy.

228
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,239
Felt easy to me.

229
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:35,825
What was he wearing?

230
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,618
He was dressed
as a dinosaur.

231
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,538
Is that why you dropped
out of high school?
I don't know.

real glasses?

233
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:41,789
No.

234
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,042
Ah, do you
feel that, Britta?

235

10% darker now.

of person becomes
a psychologist, Britta?

A person that wishes,
deep down,

239
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,343
that everyone more special
than them was sick,

240
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:56,304
because "healthy"
sounds so much more
exciting than "boring."
