00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,548
Vision boarding.

178
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:24,134
Okay, vision boarding!
Oh, hi, Jeffrey.

179
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:26,094
Dean, I have to warn you
about something,

180
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,554
because it's the
right thing to do.

181
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,182
But first,
why is there a big
empty box on your desk

182
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:31,474
that says
"Humphries" on it?

183
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,564
Okay, the press has been
calling about Humphries,

184
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,858
and I didn't want any details
about his enrollment here

185
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,109
to be spun against us,

186
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,237
so now there are no details.

187
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:44,403
Oh, ooh.

188
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,323
That was his thesis.

189
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,493
Okay! So sue me!

190
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,912
This ain't Harvard, Jeffrey.

191
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,705
Okay, my job is

192
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,166
to give a certain number
of degrees per year,

193
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,043
or we could get shut down.

194
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,878
And that would be bad
because...

195
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,881
Ah, because then
I wouldn't have a job.

196
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:05,217
And, you know,
Greendale is a good place
for good people.

197
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,551
That whole spiel, huh?

198
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,345
Yeah.

199
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:10,180
That whole spiel.

200
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:12,849
(GRUMBLES)

201
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:13,975
(LINE RINGING)

202
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,978
Wingblade.
Shock me by impressing me.

203
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,439
He shredded Humphries.
<i>What?</i>

204
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,025
I told you!
How could you
let this happen?

205
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,652
Sir, I have to ask you
to leave the concierge desk.
(GROANS)

206
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:28,365
Jeff, this case
was all I had.

207
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:29,824
I am screwed!

208
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,535
My wife left.
My girlfriend dumped me.

209
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,204
And they're sisters, so now
the whole family's pissed.

210
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:35,914
Shut up.

211
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,291
Bring me all the paperwork
for filing a class action.

212
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,750
Letters of intent,
engagement, everything.

213
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:39,834
Multiple copies.

214
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,754
Winger, you just lost
our client!

215
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,089
Yeah.

216
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,133
But I can create
five new ones.

217
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,343
It's so dusty.
Let's get this
off the table.

218
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,470
And that's
the Winger guarantee.

219
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,644
Okay, maybe
we should brainstorm
fundraising ideas...

220
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,562
Oh!
That aren't bake sales...

221
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,773
Hey.
Or opening a zoo where
the humans are in cages

222
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:02,857
and the animals
come to visit.

223
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,276
G'oh!
(GROANS)

224
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,486
Are you okay, Jeff?
You left kind of freaked out.

225
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,157
Well...

226
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,409
I can't stop thinking
this school might be
in trouble

227
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:13,910
because of this
bridge-collapsing guy.

228
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,662
He's the one
making bad bridges.

229
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:19,166
That's like me
blaming owls for how much
I suck at analogies.

230
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,419
Sometimes a student
will claim, in court,

231
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:25,297
that their school
ruined their life,

232
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:26,840
and they'll win.

233
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,300
You want to save Greendale?

234
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,510
Make it litigation-proof.
How?

235
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,887
Think like the enemy.

236
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,764
How did Greendale
damage you, Annie?

237
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:37,351
It didn't. I love
hospital administration.

238
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:40,437
Is that your job?
Well...not yet.

239
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,024
But I administer things
to hospitals,

240
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,692
like these.

241
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:46,943
Pen?

242
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,196
"Futurza"?

243
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,822
They're a rising star
in pharmaceuticals.

244
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,282
They invented fibromyalgia

245
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:54,201
and the cure
for fibromyalgia.

246
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,077
You push drugs now?
That's ironic.

247
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,996
I push pens, Britta.

248
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,040
Speaking of irony,
how's the therapy market?

249
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,958
Depressed?
I'm on sabbatical.

250
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,001
You're Jewish?

251
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,294
I'm doing
hands-on research

252
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:06,338
about the psychology
of alcoholism.

253
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,131
You're a bartender,
aren't you?

254
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,175
Which is basically like
a modern-day therapist.

255
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,634
If somebody tells me
about a murder,

256
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,094
I can't tell anyone.

257
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,929
Wow, you're even bad
at bartending.

258
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,556
What about you?

259
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,975
Abed's working on
the next billion-dollar
social media app.

260
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,728
And when it takes off,
all I got to do is sue him.

261
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,313
It's fool-proof.

262
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:24,898
You're programming now,
Abed?

263
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,317
Didn't get any work with
your four-year film degree?

264
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:28,609
One job,
directing a commercial.

265
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,652
Still haven't been paid.

266
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,987
I'll cut you
a check tomorrow,

267
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,156
but just so we're clear,
you quit.

268
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:34,741
Creative differences.

269
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,201
I asked you to put
the phone number on
the screen.

270
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,370
I didn't like the number.
555? It's derivative.

271
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:39,579
It's the number
of my business.

272
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,580
It sounds fake.

273
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,040
How can every number
start with 555?

274
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,166
Are there only
10,000 numbers?

275
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,918
Abed, you quit?

276
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,253
You said you got fired.

277
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,129
You haven't paid rent in our
apartment in two months.

278
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:49,423
Well, why don't you
sell him a pill

279
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:50,965
that will help him
give up on his dreams?

280
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,176
Relaxabrex doesn't make you
give up on your dreams.

281
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,095
That's a side effect.

282
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,847
At least the drugs I sell
don't get slurped
out of my belly button.

283
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,266
That's only on
Tummy Tuesdays!

284
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,142
Oh, it's okay...
Oh, I'm sorry...

285
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:02,352
Andre left again.

286
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,732
It's...it's not like
last time.

287
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,776
He's staying with family.

288
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,070
He took the boys.
He took the dog.

289
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,530
He took the D.V.R.

290
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:16,616
166 episodes of <i> Bones</i>
just gone.

291
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:20,120
It was my fault this time.

292
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,162
I cheated on him

293
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,458
with Shirley's sandwiches.

294
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:25,666
I threw the money
into expanding.

295
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,253
I just didn't think
I could fail.

296
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:33,841
Okay.

297
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,761
Well, just so you know,

298
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,389
this is the sort of stuff
that someone could use

299
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:41,641
to make a claim
against a school.

I want you to think about
what I said

304
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,531
as an exercise.

305

about doing this without...

you asked for.

312
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,763
Oh.

313
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,140
Classic Winger.

314
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,225
I forgot what it was like
to be good at being bad.

315
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,853
So just close the deal
and bring it home
to daddy, eh?

I'll take it from here.

No, no, but it's my case.

319
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,109

Good.

more scared.

You trust-funded,

You're an amateur
monster, Alan,

325
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,206
and you stomp in the grave
of a real monster

to stay buried

have shame,

to this school.

That's for making
the last four years happen.

334
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:04,432
And now I get to make
them un-happen

335

for me and the only people
I care about.

Are you sure?
Yes.

352
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,515
And we've come
to a decision as a group,

353
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:48,727
and please don't judge us
for suggesting it.

354
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,729
Hey, I'll back you up
no matter what.

355
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,313
We decided to re-enroll
at Greendale.

356
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:53,772
What? Are you nuts?

357
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,900
(ALL CHANTING)
Greendale! Greendale!

358
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,277
Greendale! Greendale!

359
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,194
You guys want to
keep it down?

00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:02,031
Chang?
Kevin?

362
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:05,619
Chang.

363
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,785
I've dropped
the amnesia thing,

364
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,663
copped to my crimes,
and went to jail.

365
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:09,706
Now I'm on work release.

366
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:11,458
Working as what?
Math teacher.

367
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,833
Next, explain the pajamas.

368
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,335
Well, I'm on work release
from house arrest,

369
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:15,211
but I don't have a home.

370
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,504
See this?

371
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:19,466
This won't let me travel
100 yards from this,

372
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,884
and this only has
a 30-yard cord,

373
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,178
so I can only travel...

374
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,430
Whatever.
You do the math.

375
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:26,514
You said you teach math.

376
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,807
Exactly, I teach it.
You do it.

377
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,188
Chang was faking
his Changnesia?

378
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,483
They seriously rehired
a teacher

379
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,443
they fired for trying
to burn down the school?

380
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,654
After being rehired
as a security guard

381
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,614
after being fired for
impersonating a teacher.

382
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,407
That's insane,
and I'm Abed.

383
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:46,409
Worse than insane.
Irresponsible.

384
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:48,369
Evil.
I don't believe in evil.

385
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:51,331
But this school clearly
got a finger up its butt
as a child.

386
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,166
This place ruins lives.

387
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,959
If that were true,

388
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:59,088
then what could we
possibly do about it?

389
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:01,758

Make 'em dance, Winger.

392
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:10,391
Ew, Jeff, what's your evil
old legal nemesis doing here?

393
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:11,850
Nemesis?

394
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:15,188
No, we were partners again

395
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,315
until I lost my usefulness.

396
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,150
I may be evil,

397
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:23,070
but your friend here is
so much more dangerous.

398
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,739
Tell 'em how it took you
30 minutes

399
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,866
to make them think
they wanted to sue
their own school.

(GASPS)

401
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:31,663
I did it. (CHUCKLES)

402
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,039
Sorry.

403
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,750
Anyway, I'll leave you
to pick up these pieces.

404
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,585
I'm gonna go
score some blow.

My dealer's
a gym teacher here.
(CHUCKLES)

406
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:50,849
You were lying to us?

407
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,226
I never lied to you.

408
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,854
I showed you
the right truth.

409
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,522
Britta, when we met,

410
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,148
you were
an eclectic anarchist.

411
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,693
How did you become
the group's airhead?

412
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,444
Thank you?
And, Shirley,

413
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:05,572
you've gone from
an independent divorcee

414
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,407
striking out on her own

415
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:10,577
to a bankrupt fry cook hoping
for a call from her husband.

416
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,705
Troy, your entire identity
has been consumed

417
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,540
by your relationship
with another man.

418
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,291
You found my
Clive Owen Tumblr.

419
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,711
And what happened to Annie
the unstoppable go-getter?

420
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,588
Well, there was that
gas leak last year.

421
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,798
Oh, don't blame it all
on the gas leak year.

422
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,508
This was
a four-year process.

423
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,635
We went in one end
as real people

424
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:30,096
and out the other end
as mixed-up cartoons.

425
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,305
Cool.
Sure.

426
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,724
This coming from
the guy who's had

427
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,475
how many psychotic breaks
on campus?

428
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:35,894
Are we including
the gas leak year?

429
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,271
You all came here with
a chance to be something,

430
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,356
and you all had that
taken away from you.

431
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:42,316
Get something back.

432
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,818

But you're our hero.

435
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,783
I mean, in the commercial...

436
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,284
The commercial was a lie.

437
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,160
You staged a robot fight?

438
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,161
Yeah.

439
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,664
In real life,
the robot wins.

440
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:02,962
Troy?

441
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,551
If Jeff didn't change,

442
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,887
then Jeff is right.

443
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:13,640
Case closed.
Let's make some money.

444
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,683
Okay, Jeff, if this is what
you really want to do.

445
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:17,811
I'll sign.

446
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,813
The choice to make is yours.

447
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,522
No, it's yours.

448
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,819
We're putting Greendale
in your hands.

449
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:35,995
Do we all have
to say something?

450
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,789
No, you can
just sign it.
Okay.

451
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:40,708
You brought us together.

452
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,042
With lies.

453
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,462
But what you do is
above lying, remember?

454
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:45,463
You show us the right truth.

455
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,010
You won't regret this.

(ALL CHEER HALFHEARTEDLY)

457
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,226
I'd like to take
the study room table
in back and burn it.

458
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,646
Burn it? Why?

459
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:04,649
The same reason
I never returned <i> Time Bandits</i>
to blockbuster.

460
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,026
Nobody else deserves it.

461
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:17,036
Jesus!

462
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:19,914
Looks as if you've lost
your way.

463
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:20,957
Pierce?

464
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,041
Continue on this path,

465
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,668
and you might miss
your last chance

466
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,587
to see the Pierce Hawthorne
Museum of gender sensitivity

467
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:29,298
and sexual potency
on the central quad.

468
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,092
The museum and this hologram
were donated in compliance

469
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:35,471
with a court order
I'm not allowed to discuss.

470
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:38,391
Let's just say some women
can't take a compliment.

471
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,018
Unbelievable.

472
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,770
What I am allowed
to discuss is Greendale,

473
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,146
and I'll say this.

474
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,607
Don't turn your back on it.

475
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:49,235
Take it from a man with
no legal right to be there.

476
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,571
You're in a special place.

477
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,031
A crappy place, sure,

478
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,908
but only because it gives
crappy people a chance

479
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,993
to sort themselves out.

480
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,872
Did I sound gay
at the end?

481
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,122
Do you want to do
another take?

482
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,249
Ah!

483
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,793
Jeffrey, I'm not decent.
I know.

484
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,211
These are the signatures

485
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,756
of the five people
that are crazy enough

486
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,424
to care about this toilet.

487
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,676
And tonight, I almost
got them to sue it.

488
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:14,969
Heed the warning!

489
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,763
It's not easy being dean,
Jeffrey!

490
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,264
Then stop being the dean!

491
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,182
It's my whole ideantity!

492
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,309
I mean, wah,
see what I did there?
That's proof!

493
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:25,021
Get your crap together.

494
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:27,065
Your job is not
to hand out degrees.

495
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,400
Your job is to
make this a toilet

496
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,361
that people don't have
to be crazy to care about.

497
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:35,364
But you could stay here
and help me save the school.

498
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:36,449
For how much money?

499
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,825
I, I can't offer you
any money.

500
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,285
I could offer you a job.

501
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,954
You just described slavery.

502
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:43,581
I mean, there's nothing
in the budget
for school saver,

503
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:47,167
but I could hire you as...

504
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,714
(SIGHS)
Screw you, Abed.

505
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:57,136
I'd be depressed right now
if these samples from work

506
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,430
weren't giving me
a new outlook on life.

507
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,265
If you're interested
in learning more,

508
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,434
ask your doctor
if Joyvatrex
is right for you.

509
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,894
Oh, honey.

510
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:06,395
If we sue Greendale,

511
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:07,855
can I be
a surprise witness?

512
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,440
Wait. Don't tell me.

513
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,400
Stop!

514
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:12,568
We shouldn't
sue the school.

515
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,361
Oh.
Come on!

516
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,739
Are you trying to give us
emotional whiplash?

517
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:19,993
Look, if you feel
there's more work to be
done on yourselves,

518
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:23,121
then as crappy
as this place is,

519
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,413
it's a place that
you can do it.

520
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:25,539
You got a job
teaching here,
didn't you?

521
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,583
I don't want
to talk about it.

522
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,837
Well, then,
I'm getting back into
forensic science.

523
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,088
That was my actual dream.

524
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,881
It's my fault
I bailed on it.

525
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:36,175
A film degree doesn't
make me a filmmaker.

526
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,384
I need to learn how to work
with other people.

527
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,845
I need to figure out
who I am.

528
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,262
I'll help you.

529
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,056
Get out of my brain.

530
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,224
I need to learn how
to really run a business

531
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,853
by my own standards,
not Greendale's.

532
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,604
I'm gonna get
a four-year psych degree,

533
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:49,605
then a master's,

534
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,983
and become
a real psychologist.

535
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,694
Or you could find
another major.

536
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,070
A real psychologist.

537
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:58,031
How about English?
Psychology.

538
00:19:58,072 --> 00:19:59,782
All right,
what's important is,

539
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,951
no matter what,

540
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:05,121
we'll be trying
to talk Britta into doing
something different

541

545
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:20,594

Oh, my god, be careful!

a voice-over wrap-up

at the end of
every episode.

553
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:41,281
Wow.
Cool.

554
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:44,284
<i>Because around here,</i>
<i>they never last very long.</i>

555
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,914
Once more.
More teachery.

556
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,498
I want to kill myself.

557
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,499
Use that.

558
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,674
Are you a good person?

559
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:00,259
Yes, unlike you.

560
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,179
I can guarantee
the Winger beaten you.

561
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:04,304
Not anymore.
