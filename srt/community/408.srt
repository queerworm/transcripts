1
00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:03,754
And then
in the season finale,

2
00:00:03,796 --> 00:00:05,756
they reveal the whole thing
was a dream,

3
00:00:05,798 --> 00:00:07,257
when the inspector
wakes up

4
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:11,345
next to a very young
and very topless Cheryl Tiegs.

5
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:12,387
(GROANING)

6
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,222
Even Pierce loves
this show now?

7
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:15,516
It's not
<i>Inspector Spacetime.</i>

8
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,392
It's the American version,
and it's a travesty.

9
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,269
It's broad, obvious, sexist,
and the timing is...

10
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:21,146
Honey, I'm Dean!

11
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:22,690
What the hell
is wrong with you?

12
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:25,776
Oh, Jeffrey,
you are too much.
(LAUGHS)

13
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:27,903
Why, I was doing
some house cleaning
the other day...

14
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,363
"Deana Reed" style...

15
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:31,072
When I realized,
"Gosh, golly,

16
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,826
"it's been ages
since we had a dance."

17
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:37,663
So, this Friday
we are going back to
Greendale's golden age

18
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:39,874
with an old-fashioned
sock hop!

19
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,208
(BOTH GIGGLING)

20
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,960
The health department
requires you wear shoes.

21
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:45,004
What a "coincidean."

22
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:47,214
You're throwing a dance
the same day
the CDC is confiscating

23
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:48,924
our drinking fountains.
Well...

24
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,676
Placating students
with a fun event.

25
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:52,093
Classic bread and circuses.

26
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,846
In ancient Rome,
the emperor would
distract the populace

27
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:55,055
from their problems
by allocating money

28
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,682
for free bread and circuses.

29
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:58,058
I've been making
a conscious effort
to get away

30
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,393
from filtering everything
through TV.

31
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:00,728
I figured it's time
I showed some growth.

32
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:01,896
It's been three
and a half seasons...

33
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:02,980
Is what the old me
would have said.

34
00:01:03,022 --> 00:01:04,147
Oh.
Aw.

35
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,859
Anyhoo, it is
a Sadie Hawkins dance,

36
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:10,195
which means
girls ask the boys.
Oh, I love those!

37
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:13,365
So, ladies, get out there
and make yourselves useful.

38
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,242
(SNORTS) So you're saying
There's one day a year

39
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:16,994
when women are free
to choose their own mates.

40
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:19,329
What is this,
cave-person times?

41
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:21,749
Well I have already started
on a Sadie Hawkins banner,

42
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,043
so this thing
is pretty much
set in stone.

43
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:25,544
Well then maybe I'll throw
my own dance,

44
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:28,630
one that doesn't
conform to your
oppressive gender norms.

45
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:30,507
Give me a break.

46
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:34,135
You think a dance
can just be thrown
together willy-nilly?

47
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,888
You think
I decide to just do

48
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,515
a rain forest theme
and buy palm fronds

49
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:39,808
and rig the
sprinkler system to...

50
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,936
Hold on,
I gotta write this down.

51
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:45,230
<i>♪ Give me some rope</i>
<i>Tie me to dream</i>

52
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:48,358
<i>♪ Give me the hope</i>
<i>to run out of steam</i>

53
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,904
<i>♪ Somebody said</i>
<i>it can be here</i>

54
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:55,574
<i>♪ We could be roped up,</i>
<i>tied up, dead in a year</i>

55
00:01:55,616 --> 00:02:00,704
<i>♪ I can't count the reasons</i>
<i>I should stay</i>

56
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:05,125
<i>♪ One by one they all</i>
<i>just fade away ♪</i>

57
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:10,672
So, Britta, you're gonna
throw a protest dance?

58
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,382
Is that a thing?

59
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:13,550
It is now.

60
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:15,594
And instead of
Sadie Hawkins,

61
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,346
my dance will honor
a real feminist icon,

62
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,140
someone who worked
for women's rights

63
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:23,727
every day of the year...
Sophie B. Hawkins.

64
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:27,064
Oh...
It wasn't really...

65
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:28,732
You know what, Britta,
you're right.

66
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,234
A Sophie B. Hawkins dance

67
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,028
is just what
this school needs...

68
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,571
Thanks, Jeff.

69
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:38,408
To celebrate Sophie B. Hawkins
and all her accomplishments.

70
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,702
Jeez, Winger, who's throwing
this dance, me or you?

71
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:44,289
Um, Britta, I think
you meant to say
Susan B. Anthony,

72
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,874
not Sophie B. Hawkins.

73
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,918
Britta for the whoops!

74
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,795
Didn't you have a cat named
Susan B. Anthony?

75
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,338
How did you manage
to "Britta" that?

76
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,507
I didn't "Britta" anything.
I meant Sophie B. Hawkins.

77
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:56,718
Really?
Your plan was to
throw a dance

78
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,763
honoring the singer of
<i>Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover?</i>

79
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,180
And <i> As I Lay Me Down</i>

80
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:02,766
which in my opinion
is the far superior song.

81
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,183
Ooh, that is a good song.
Yeah.

82
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,811
Yes.

83
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:09,023
I am throwing
a Sophie B. Hawkins dance.

84
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:12,191
(GASPS)
And it is gonna
be amazing,

85
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,778
and when people come
they're gonna be like,

86
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,906
"Damn! She straight
Britta'd' this!"

87
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:20,034
Because, that's right,
I'm taking it back!

88
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,666
You're really doing this?

89
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,877
Look, as someone who
faked being a lawyer
for seven years

90
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,503
I appreciate your
commitment to the bit,

91
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,212
but just admit
you were wrong.

92
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,589
So you can say
I "Britta'd" it?

93
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,591
Yes, of course.
That goes without saying.

94
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,094
But come on,
it was a small mistake.

95
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,972
Call this off before
it becomes a full-scale
"Brit-astrophe."

96
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:43,557
I coined that.
Jeff,

97
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,059
if you don't want
to come to my dance

98
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,352
you are free to go
to the Sadie Hawkins dance,

99
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:51,231
which will be happening
at the same time
across the cafeteria.

100
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:52,691
Our school has limited
venue options.

101
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,818
Oh, I wouldn't miss it.

102
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,362
Oh, and one last thing...
You do realize

103
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,781
that if you call it
a Sophie B. Hawkins dance

104
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,076
people will expect
Sophie B. Hawkins

105
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:03,577
to actually be there, right?

106
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,246
(LAUGHS) Yes.

107
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,084
And when she comes
I'm gonna be like,

108
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,212
<i>"I Will Remember You</i>
doubting me."

109
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,880
That's a Sarah Mclachlan song.

110
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,510
So, Abed, I was thinking
about what you said,

111
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,846
about showing growth,
and I was thinking

112
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,347
maybe one way
to do that is

113
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,391
to meet new people and...
Where's this going?

114
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,935
Can I set you up
with a date

115
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,811
for the Sadie Hawkins
day dance?
A blind date.

116
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:30,854
I've always thought
of myself as more of
an acquired taste...

117
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:33,023
Mmm.
But...okay.

118
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:34,315
Ooh, if you're open
to meeting someone,

119
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,026
there's a number
of eligible young ladies

120
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:37,652
in my church.
Shirley!

121
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,947
I'm already finding
a date for Abed.
I asked first.

122
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,282
There's no reason
we can't both help
Abed find someone.

123
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,533
Why don't we each
pick a girl

124
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:44,701
and then let Abed decide,

125
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,203
instead of making it
a competition.

126
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:47,204
That's exactly
a competition.

127
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:49,289
So it is.
Only for the loser.

128
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,041
(DRAMATIC MUSIC)

129
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,085
I need the computer.

130
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:55,129
Pierce, there are, like,
dozens of computers.

131
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,337
Yeah, but my email is
on this one.

132
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,799
Pierce!
Jeez, what's up your butt?

133
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,134
I may have lied
this morning

134
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:01,551
about meeting
Sophie B. Hawkins

135
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,178
because I didn't want Jeff
to make fun of me,

136
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,305
and then I may have lied
to cover that lie,

137
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:08,058
and now I'm in deep...lies.

138
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,936
So what?
So you told a lie, big deal.

139
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:13,730
The important thing
is never to admit it.

140
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,523
Actually, I was thinking
about coming clean.

141
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,484
And give Winger
the satisfaction?

142
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,986
Hell, no.

143
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,696
Besides, anything could happen
between now and that dance.

144
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,198
An asteroid could hit.

145
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,033
Do you want to be
the schmuck who apologizes

146
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,868
just before the world ends?

147
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,080
That kind of makes sense.
Thank you.

148
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:31,414
Damn right
it makes sense.

149
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,792
You're talking
to the wisest man on campus.

150
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,752
Now seriously,
I need to get to my email.

151
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,629
The post office
is about to close.

152
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:38,672
Pierce!

153
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,048
Guys, check out
my friend Britta's

154
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,716
Sophie B. Hawkins dance.

155
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,593
I'll be spinning the hits
from yesterday and today,

156
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,971
which are basically
the same to me
since I have Changnesia.

157
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,388
That guy's like Teflon.

158
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,307
No matter how much
awful stuff he does,

159
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:49,557
he keep getting
another chance.

160
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,269
Yeah, he's like
the Colin Farrell of people.

161
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:53,812
You want to help me
with Britta's dance?

162
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,897
Could be a chance
for classic Troy
and Abed hijinks.

163
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,816
In the interest of growth
I'm trying to avoid hijinks,

164
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,027
as well as capers,
romps, and exploits.

165
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,444
Escapades are a gray area.

166
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,198
(CLEARS THROAT) Abed.
This is Kat.

167
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,866
Hi, Kat.
Nice to meet you.

168
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,575
She wants
to ask you something.

169
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:10,871
Isn't she
perfect for Abed?

170
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,956
She's like one of
those quirky girls
from the movies.

171
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:14,208

with a song.

I picked. (CHUCKLES)

It's cool. Not like
it was a competition
or anything.

181

Just be gentle
when you tell Shirley
that she was the loser.

182
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,239
Or do you
want me to tell her?

183
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,614
It's cool.
I'll handle it.

184
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:52,829
So, was that girl
an alien or a toddler
with a growing disease?

I talked to a lovely girl
at my church

187
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,252
and she'd be happy to go
to the dance with you.

188
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,544
I appreciate it, Shirley,
but I...

189
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,420
I hope you will
at least consider it,

190
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,382
and not just because
saying "no" would
crush this poor girl,

191
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:04,674
but because
I don't want you

opportunity of a lifetime.

Britta's dance with her.

Oh, goody!
I'll set it up.

Oh, I hope
this doesn't hurt

197
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,019

go tell her.

a date to the dance?

Yep.
Now I have two,
which means

203
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:30,200
I can do the classic
two dates in one night

in a comically
implausible situation.

00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,502
it's a once in a lifetime
opportunity for hijinks.

you wore last week.

wear it home,

does that big public

507

to the Lilith Fair between
1997 and 1999.

508
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,165
I knew it.
You're safe.

509
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,710
You did this?
But why?

510
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,463
Because, in the face
of all logic and reason,

511
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:35,591
Britta didn't back down.
That makes no sense.

512
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:36,801
Also, I didn't
like the way

513
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:37,927
you were being
such a jerk to her.

514
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:39,053
Well, she was acting crazy.

515
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,763
Yeah, but what choice
did she have?

516
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:41,973
You make fun of her,

517
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:43,850
you use her name
as a synonym
for screwing up.

518
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,601
Cut her some
slack, Jeff.

519
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:48,604
(CHEERING)
She helped you reconcile
with your dad.

520
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:51,482
For Pete's sake,
let her be happy.
