1
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:04,045
Hmm.

2
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:05,589
Shirley, did you ever date
Roger Ebert?

3
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:08,342
Excuse me?
Nothing.

4
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:09,551
Britta, did you ever
take pictures of your feet

5
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:10,427
and post them
on the internet
for money?

6
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:13,263
Sha-ha! No.

7
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:15,265
Guys, this history final
is going to be killer.

8
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:16,767
We have to study.

00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:18,101
It's no fair
Professor Cornwallis

10
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,728
turned all
hard-assed again.

11
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,605
Lucky Pierce.

12
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:23,148
Donating his
kidney to Gilbert
to get out of it.

13
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,024
I never thought
he'd be that generous.

14
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:26,109
Although,
he did seem disappointed

15
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,528
that the operation
didn't involve

16
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:28,654
sleeping with
a Russian woman,

17
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:29,613
then waking up
in a bathtub
full of ice.

18
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:30,614
Hmm.
JEFF: Guys!

19
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:32,407
Hmm?
History!

20
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,826
I am studying history.
I'm studying our history.

21
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:35,410
ALL: Abed!
JEFF: Nobody bite.

22
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,955
We agreed no biting.

23
00:00:37,997 --> 00:00:39,540
But, Jeff,
it's a graduation gift.

24
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,208
You see, on the surface
we seem like
just a group of people

25
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,668
from diverse backgrounds who
have become unlikely friends.

26
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,962
But according
to my research,

27
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:46,588
our paths have crossed
many times.

28
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,174
We were destined to meet.
Like a team of superheroes.

29
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:51,677
This is our origin story.

30
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,846
And here...we...go.

31
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:55,764
Abed, we don't have
origin stories.

32
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,057
We have lives.

33
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,058
Well, at least...

34
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,604
Yep, just me.

35
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:03,981
So you're saying
we're all connected

36
00:01:04,023 --> 00:01:05,733
like the classic
French film trilogy

37
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,693
<i>Bleu, Blanc, Rouge?</i>

38
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:08,986
No, like something
more accessible.

39
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:10,988
Like <i> Unbreakable.</i>
Wow.

40
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,365
Abed, I know
it's disappointing to you,
but we're not superheroes.

41
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:16,284
This is the real world,
not some
comic book adventure.

42
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,913
I've done it.
I've infiltrated the school.

43
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:21,206
I've learned its secrets.

44
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:23,375
I've gained everyone's trust.

45
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:26,670
And now, on the anniversary
of my empire's destruction,

46
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:28,213
vengeance will be mine.

47
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:31,926
(DISTORTED VOICE)
<i>No, vengeance will be ours.</i>

48
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:33,635
<i>Okay, can you stop that?</i>
<i>It really creeps me out.</i>

49
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:38,057
(NORMAL VOICE) I'm sorry.
Just really love this thing.

00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,504
I've been doing exhaustive
research into our lives.

59
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,172
Once I find the last
one or two missing pieces,

60
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,093
I'll have conclusive proof
that we were all
destined to meet.

61
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,510
This is how
we're all connected.

62
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,262
I call it the crazy quilt
of destiny

63
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:18,847
mainly because
the loom of fate
was already taken.

64
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:20,432
Really?
Look.

65
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,642
I don't care what tricks
or nonsense you have

66
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,310
in your scrapbook,
Martha Stewart,

67
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,853
but there's no way
you're gonna
get me to believe

68
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,314
there's some outside force
controlling my destiny.

69
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,149
And I think you used
that particular phrasing

70
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,692
because I know
you've seen <i> Star Wars.</i>

71
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:33,153
(GASPS)
Everybody's seen <i> Star Wars.</i>

72
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,447
Yes, but you first saw it
when it was
re-released in 1982

73
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,699
at the Greendale palladium
at 4:15 in the afternoon.

74
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,284
And it was the best time
you ever had with your father.

75
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,244
How did you know that?

76
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,663
You keep this ticket stub
in your wallet.

77
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,372
Abed, you can't...

78
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,750
Give it back!
Whoa!

79
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:49,753

in the distant mists
of a lost era:

(ECHOING) 2008.

81
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,426
I know you're
all wondering
how I do it.

82
00:02:56,468 --> 00:03:00,139
How do I balance
straight As,
extracurriculars,

83
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:03,224
and Israeli folk dancing
every Friday night?

84
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:07,437
It's a simple matter
of organization,

85
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,108
dedication, and...

86
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,242
And we're back!

87
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,995

92

So I heard you
weren't doing that
great in algebra,

93

and you know,
if you need
a tutor for math,

I'd be happy to help.

I'm being
recruited by colleges
to play football.

96
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:39,928
Oh.
I don't have time for math.

97
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,514
The only thing
that matters to me
are statistics.

98
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,642
Ooh!
Uh, that's also
a type of math.

(BELL RINGS)

100
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:49,229
But we already knew
I went to high school
with Troy,

101
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,398
and it's not like he even
remembered I existed.

102
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,067
Yeah, I don't
remember her at all.

00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:54,442
We should probably
drop this.

BRITTA: Wait,
where's Pierce on this chart?

105
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:57,946
His contribution
to the group has
already been noted.

Hey, is that a sad face?
I wouldn't know.

108
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,578
You have to look deeper.
Here. Take this, for example.

109
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,081
It's a receipt I found
in the back of Shirley's
sock drawer on Thanksgiving.

110
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:08,999
You went in my bedroom
for some comic book thing?

111
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,251
Oh, no, my feet were cold.
Ah, here.

112
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,586
You should probably
wash those.
Oh.

113
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,421
ABED: Discovering the receipt
was dumb luck,

114
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:17,507
but it proves
that we were at the mall
on the exact same day.

115
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,676
Shirley, do remember
what you bought for $54
at the Love Hut?

116
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,261
What? Hmm? No.

117
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,182
So excited about tonight,
honey.

00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:28,727

since we had adult time
without the kids.

00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:35,150
Well, I may have
an anniversary
surprise for you too.

121
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,111
Well, I'm in public,
but, uh...

122
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,070
You know you gonna get it,
right?

00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:40,280
You gonna get it!

It's a critical document.

See, Greendale

00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,479
we turn into a casino

I found it in a copy of

it was definitely creative.

five years back taxes

Excuse me, Mr. Winger,
can we get a...

172
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:31,933
You're a hero.

173
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,727
Hi.
Hi.

174
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:36,563
Guys! We have
got to capitalize
on this momentum.

175
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:40,734
It is time An-her-chists
finally takes a stand
on animals rights.

176
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,362
There is a medical lab
in an office building nearby.

177
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:44,696
Next week,
I say we break in there...

178
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,157
Actually, we were thinking
this is our last hurrah.

179
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,742
But this was
our first hurrah.

180
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,785
We're just getting going.
Britta, we're done.

181
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,162
I had a hamburger
the other day,

182
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:53,496
and suddenly
I'm not cold
all the time.

183
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:56,457
Fine. Go.
I don't need you.

184
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,420

without her organization?

185
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:05,884
Jeffrey, how could you?

186
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,594
Well, I was
a really good lawyer.

187
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:10,055
Mysti is the stripper
that Andre cheated
on me with,

188
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,431
and you defended her.

189
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:13,600
Shirley, I...

190
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,476
If you hadn't gotten
that homewrecker off,

191
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,229
Andre never
would've met her.

192
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:20,107
ABED: Jeff ends
Shirley's marriage.

193
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,442
See? I told you
we were always
destined to meet.

194
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,443
Hmm.

195
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,030
ABED: I knew Shirley and Jeff
went to the same rec center,

196
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,573
but I had no idea
their paths crossed again.

197
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,367
This is good.
This is really great.

198
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:31,492
We're really filling in
some plot holes here.

199
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,661
This is good stuff.
It's really good.

200
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:37,082
Have I missed something?
These aren't plot holes, Abed.
This is my life.

201
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,459
But this kinda connection
only makes our origin story
more compelling.

202
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,502
Like how awesome it is
when Uncle Ben is murdered
in <i> Spider-Man.</i>

203
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,504
Hmm.
My marriage almost ended.

204
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,505
If it weren't for Jeff,

205
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,133
that jezebel
would've been in jail

206
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,968
instead of between
my Laura Ashley sheets.

207
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,345
Hey, this is not my fault.

208
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,973
And by the way,
the case didn't work out
too great for me either.

209
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,682
It was supposed to make
my career,

210
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,435
but it put a target
on my back.

And it doesn't affect
his breathing?

214
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,026
Nope.

215
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,695
Mysti, can I talk to Jeff
for a moment?

216
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,990
I will go, uh,
powder my nose.

217
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,492
For real.

218
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,536
Listen.

219
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,289
There's this rumor
going around the firm

220
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,499
that you never received
an undergraduate degree.

221
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,085
(LAUGHS)
That's ridiculous.
I know.

222
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:25,464
I mean, some jag
is obviously jealous
of your rising star.

223
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,007
But the fact is,
until this is settled,

224
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,176
the bar isn't gonna
let you practice.

225

So you got caught
in your own lie?

226
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,682
I almost lost my family.

227
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,225
How does your
little tragedy
even compare?

228
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,478
Because I had to go
to school here.

229
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,979
Abed, do not write that down.

230
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,357
It's not like
I made Andre cheat.

231
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,859
Well, I happen to think
it's cool that
we're all connected,

even if some of it's
in bad ways.

I'm finally willing
to forgive Annie

a keg stand.

nothing to do with me.

And you already admitted
that you faked that injury

249

take the pressure

you said to me.

You didn't even
remember that I went
to school with you.

00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,411
They need an enemy.

345
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,580
Batman has the Joker,
the Justice League
has The Legion of Doom,

346
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:12,208
and this study group...
Has me.

347
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,294
I'm the supervillain.
Why didn't I see it before?

348
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,212
I'm emotionless, logical,
smarter than everybody else.

349
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:18,506
Hey!
I tried sawing off
Jeff's arm.

350
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:19,924
Why do you keep
saying that?

351
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,342
I should go. It's not
safe to be around me.

352
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:22,594
I'm just as bad.

353
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,011
I couldn't handle the monkey,

354
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,723
so I traded it in
for a glaucoma brownie,

355
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:28,433
even though I knew
if it bit someone,

356
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,685
it would make them
a teensy bit psychotic.

357
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:31,810
Britta's right.

358
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,689
We've all made
some bad decisions.

359
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,815
And if you really wanna know
who the villain is here,

360
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,192
it's me.

361
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,615
Ah.
Wee! (GIGGLES)

362
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:45,408
Yeesh, I didn't think
it was possible

363
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,785
to put more glitter on.

364
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,536
It's coming off of you
like pig-pen.

365
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,580
Well, some people
seem to like it.

366
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:53,040
This married guy
just gave me
his phone number.

367
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,417
Can you believe
his wife left him

368
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,085
on their anniversary?

369
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:58,379
You gonna call him?
I mean, he did just win
a bunch of money.

370
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:00,089
I don't know though.
You don't know what?

371
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:01,508
You're not married.

372
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,050
You gotta grab
what you want
in this life.

373
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,219
That's the way it works.

374
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,845
Someone just took something
important from me.

375
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:08,889
And you know what?

376
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,184
I admire him for it.

377
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,269
All right, I mean,
I guess I'll go talk to him.

378
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,895
You do that.
And I'm gonna go get

379
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,649
"crap on other
people's lawns" Drunk.

380
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:19,192
To a memorable evening
for both of us.

381
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,824
Maybe you coincidentally
affected some of us.

382
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,576
But I actively
endorsed pain.

383
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:32,079
I was the bad guy,
and...

384
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,499
I'd like to think
I'm not that guy anymore.

385
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,209
Also, and I hate
to bring this up,

386
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,713
you did once make me
pee myself.

387
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:42,923
Well, I guess
we're even then.

388
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,759
I might finish
studying at home.

389
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,561
Just ten minutes ago,

390
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,895
I would've been so excited
about that peeing thing.

391
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:13,663
I wanted to make a prequel,
and I ruined everything.

392
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,416
I guess it could happen
to anyone.

393
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,585
I should probably
write George Lucas
a note of apology.

394
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,879
Okay, let's not get crazy.

395
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,922
And you didn't
ruin anything.

396
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,008
SHIRLEY: May I sit here?

397
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,510
JEFF: Shirley,
what are you doing here?

398
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,095
Oh, just wanted
some yogurt.

399
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,433
And I do know
you're not that
person anymore.

400
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,227
Are you sure?
'Cause I was
awfully good at it.

401
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,937
Well, we all do bad things
every now and again.

402
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:40,064
I mean, I put
a stripper's head
through a jukebox.

403
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,441
Hmm.

404
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:42,942
What are you guys
doing here?

405
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,865
I guess we all
really wanted yogurt.

406
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:50,658
You know what's weird?

407
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,160
This is where I first decided
to go to Greendale.

408
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,079
ANNIE: Wait, really?

409
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,791
This is where I was
when I first decided
to go to Greendale.

410
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,041
You're kidding me.

411
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,797
<i>Senor</i> Chang, I know you're
as disappointed as I am

412
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:05,632
in the caliber of students
we have at Greendale.

413
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:09,677
But the mall offers
a whole new
valuable demographic

414
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,387
of people awake
during the daytime.

415
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,514
All right,
I'll pass flyers
at yogurtsburgh.

416
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,475
Self-serve yogurt.

417
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:18,144
Those doofuses already know
one marketable skill.
Okay, Ben...

418
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,187
But it still has
the tags on!

419
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,940
So I lost the receipt.

420
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,232
It's not like I even got
to wear it,

421
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:26,068
because my husband's
a tasteless man slut.

422
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,988
What...
Hey, littering!

423
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,784
(GASPING)

424
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,162
This better not awaken
anything in me.

425
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,297
God, this day...

426
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,007
I thought pushing
that woman's head
through a jukebox

427
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,592
would make me feel better,
but I'm just...

428
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,093
Out of $54...

429
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,638
And a marriage.

430
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,806
<i>Crystal Skull</i> was aliens,

431
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:56,223
so it's a pretty great film.

432
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,149
You guys seen this?

433
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:08,778
Guys, working the program
with you has been so great.

434
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,447
I feel like I'm finally ready
to get my life back on track.

435
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,035
Last chance.
Just walk over
there right now

436
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,996
and apologize
to the theater manager.

437
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,039
Midichlorians.

438
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:22,249
Midichlorians!

439
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,376
Fine.

440
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,044
Then you're not going
to film school!

441
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,674
Hi! Do you have
any vegan froyo?

442
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:32,010
Do you even know
what froyo is?

443
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,012
Fine. Do you have
a job application?

444
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,137
Hey.

445
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,806
That weird guy
hasn't blinked once.

446
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:39,851
Oh, yeah.

447
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,855
What a dweeb.
Yeah, what a dweeb.

448
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,356
(LAUGHS)
Oh, nice shot, man!

449
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,029
Hey, do you work
at Greendale?

450
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,613
Work? That's putting it
charitably.

451
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:54,949
Greendale Community College
is a total joke.

452
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,744
They'd give a degree
to a monkey.

453
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:01,789
Hey, does Ian Duncan
still teach psychology
at Greendale?

454
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,499
That drunken limey?
That's the one.

455
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:04,959
He's got tenure.

456
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,794
Maybe getting my degree
won't be as hard as I thought.

457
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:08,337
(PIERCE GRUNTING)

458
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,381
WOMAN:
Sir, what are you doing?

459
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,843
WOMAN: Can we get
some help out here?

460
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:16,012
Some old guy
broke the machine and is
faking a heart attack.

461
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,559
Oh, wait.

462
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,061
Ah, stupid.

463
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,563
(ALL LAUGHING)

464
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,572
Cool, cool, cool.

465
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:37,450
Wait, so was that old guy
really Pierce?

466
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:41,120
We'll never know,
because he'll never
ever remember.

467
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,580
What are the chances
of all of us

468
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,041
ending up at the same place
at the same time twice?

469
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,918
Abed, it's amazing.

470
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,335
I mean, yes,
2008 was the height

471
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,005
of the slightly sour
frozen yogurt craze, but...

472
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:53,215
That still doesn't explain it.

473
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,635
Maybe we really were
all meant to be together.

474
00:18:55,676 --> 00:19:00,514
I'm not sure I understand it,
but maybe we don't have to.

475
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,810
What I do know is that
the ways our paths crossed,

476
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:07,146
even when they were bad,
all led us to this point.

477
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,691
And I wouldn't have it
any other way.

478
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:13,111
So what you're saying
is that we're all each other's
uncle Ben's murder.

479
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,237
And we're all Spider-Men.

480
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,116
Yeah.

481
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,617
Let's say I'm saying that.

482
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,786
Mmm, I think we know
whose will this really is.

483
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:24,747
Yeah, I think I do.

484
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,000
I'll be right back.

485
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,172
Hello?

486
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,176
Hey, Abed.

487
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:42,098
(SIGHS) Just doing
some pilates.

488
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,017
I was looking for you.
Wha... I...

489
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:47,061
We discovered
you're the reason
we all went to Greendale.

490
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,479
You linked
all of our stories.

491
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,564
Like how the cosmic cube
assembled The Avengers.

492
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:53,109
That, and the 4-billion-dollar
deal with Disney.

493
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:55,653
Turns out
you were always one of us.

494
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,197
So I came to see
if you wanted to get
some frozen yogurt.

495
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,074
Really?

496
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,076
That's...

497
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:04,745
That's all I ever wanted.

498
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,249
But it's too late.

499
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,335
Here's another thing
I realized.

500
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:14,005
Because of you
we got to reinvent
ourselves at Greendale.

501
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:16,716
Everyone should have
the same chance,
don't you think...

502
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,592
Chang?
It's not Chang.

503
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:19,593
It's Kevin.

504
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:23,806
How long have you known?

505
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,059
Known what?

506
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,310
Only you know
who you really are.

507
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,438
Also, you may have
experimental monkey fever.

508
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:33,649
You coming?

509
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,488
Yeah.

510
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,619
Actually, can we stop
at the post office first?

511
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,121
I have something to mail
for the dean.

512
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,956
It's confidential
and I don't wanna
talk about it,

513
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:50,208
so stop interrogating me.

514
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,297
I'm out.
