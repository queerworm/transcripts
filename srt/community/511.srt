We just got a very interesting
energy surge
at the Greendale site.

174
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,729
<i>Oh, okay.</i>
<i>That's super fascinating.</i>

175
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,647
<i>Um, Destro's dead!</i>

176
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:40,192
<i>Oh, my gosh, Destro?</i>
<i>Were you guys close?</i>

177
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,194
Were we close?
Yes!

178
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:43,570
What kind of a question is...

179
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:46,240
Okay, fine.
I loved him!

180
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,075
Is that what you want
to hear?

181
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,743
Called it.
(DEVICE BEEPS)

182
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,246
And we are going to find out
how this happened,

183
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:57,084
and G.I. Joe
is going to paybra!

184
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,752
COBRA: (CLEARS THROAT)
I riffed that.

185
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,503
No wrong answers.

186
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:03,257
It's a condition that
comes on when you get
to a certain weight.

187
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,592
Oh, I see.
So is there a
Mr. Tight Ship, or...

188
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,760
Um...

189
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,262
(ALARM BLARING)

190
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:09,428
TIGHT SHIP:
That's a code three.

191
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,431
Cobra forces are
infiltrating the base.

192
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,809
Cobra!

193
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:18,146
Avenge my totally
platonic friend!

194
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,275
Oh, great, and
we're stuck in here.

195
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:23,360
DEEP DISH:
We don't have to be.

196
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:26,821
For 15 years, I have used
my trademark tablespoon
to excavate a tunnel,

197
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,574
swallowing handfuls
of dirt and rock
with my meals

198
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,243
and listening only
to Smash Mouth

199
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:32,994
in order to justify
this poster.

200
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,205
Now I am within inches
of reaching the...

201
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,417
WINGMAN:
Come on, if we
help save the base,

202
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,460
maybe they'll let us
be G.I. Joes again.

203
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,172
Battle stations!

204
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:45,882
BUZZKILL:
Snakes at 6 o' clock.

205
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,553
Okay, now remember,
don't kill anybody.

206
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,847
Just lay down
a suppressive fire,
like this.

207
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:57,018
WINGMAN: Oh, sorry.
Sorry! Oh, my gosh!

208
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,563
Oh, God.
Oh, man.
Oh, darn it.

209
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,399
Yeah, I'd say
they're suppressed.

210
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:05,610
WINGMAN: Jeez.
Aw, was that a lifeline?
Sorry!

211
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,112
Someone's killing people.

212
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,905
It's Wingman!
He's escaped!

213
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,325
Lay down a
suppressive fire!

214
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,410
They're suppressive
firing at us!

215
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:15,162
I think we'll be okay.

216
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,038
Remember, this is all
just a cartoon about
action figures for kids.

217
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,332
Shut up, Fourth Wall,

218
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,208
get into the new
G.I. Joe submachopter

219
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,003
with twin rocket launchers
and rotating attack jet.

220
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,884
All I want to do is
be a good G.I. Joe.

221
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,552
What's wrong with me?

222
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,263
I'm not sure, but
I think our answers
will be at Greendale.

223
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:34,681
Ugh.
FOURTH WALL:
(ECHOING) Greendale.

224
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,350
FOURTH WALL:
Whoops.

225
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,059
BUZZKILL:
Shouldn't somebody
be flying the plane?

226
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,853
FOURTH WALL:
It's submachopter.
BUZZKILL: Whatever.

227
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,104
THREE KIDS:
Will somebody
grab the stick?

228
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:42,563
I don't wanna die
up here! Oh, lord!

229
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,362
ANNOUNCER: <i> The G.I. Joe</i>

<i>Buzzkill...</i>

231
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:51,990
All government is a lie.

I control everything,

Doesn't this guy
also do the voice

236
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,791
ANNOUNCER:
<i>And their nefarious,</i>
<i>ruthless leader, Wingman.</i>

237
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,002
Hey, that's not true!
I love G.I. Joe!

238
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,837
ANNOUNCER: <i> I don't know, man.</i>
<i>Seems like you hate it.</i>

239
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,588
This is all
a misunderstanding.

(GASPS)

244
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,721
Cartoon coffee?

245
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,556
Tightship is piloting
the submachopter.

246
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,266
At first it was Buzzkill, but
she almost crashed five times,

247
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,726
and when we pointed it out,

248
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,019
she called us sexist
and went to the bathroom.

249
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,562
THREE KIDS:
You know she's smoking
in there, right?

250
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,398
She broke the detector.
That's a federal crime.

251
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,774
I keep having
these visions.

252
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,776
Kids, little boys.

253
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,696
Uh, are these visions
we should share
with the authorities?

254
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,907
I want to go to this
Greendale place now.

255
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,658
We're on our way.
Do you remember
Greendale, Jeffrey?

256
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,702
Why did you call me that?
What's with you people?

257
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:38,953
BOTH: What do you mean,
"You people"?

258
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,372
Oh!
Nice.

259
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,876
COBRA SOLDIER:
Sector three, all clear.

260
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,753
That's the entrance
to the excavation site.

261
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,796
How do we get past
those guards?

262
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,673
I think I got an idea.

263
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,178
Your idea was doing
exactly what we did

264
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,721
to those other guards
back at headquarters?

265
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,014
It was proven effective.

266
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,558
I don't know,
seems kind of cheap.

267
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,351
From an animated perspective,
very cheap.

268
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:02,602
Help me club
this hatch open.

00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:04,687
(THUDDING)

270
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:10,110
I know this place.

271
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,820
It's filling me
with a sense of
endless hours

272
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:16,824
for unfair wages and
printers that never
have toner.

COBRA ASSISTANT COMMANDER:
What is this, Major Dick?

274
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,370
That is a request
for hazard pay.

275
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:23,540
Maybe you haven't heard,
but we can actually
die now.

276
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:25,083
You know we can't
afford this.

277
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,043
Oh, so we can afford
to create a new model

278
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,753
of weaponized vehicle
once a week,

279
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,381
but we basically
get minimum wage
to risk our lives.

280
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:33,758
Well, welcome to
Cobra, Ximxam.

281
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,177
Maybe you noticed
our logo was a snake?

282
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,388
Suck it up, guys!
And while I have
your attention, here.

283
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,014
What is this?

284
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,267
We have to lower the salaries.
Our insurance is going up.

285
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,560
No way.
What?

286
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,395
Hey, you people
can actually die now.

287
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:46,980
It affects the health plan.

But which me

299
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,963
is the real me?

(LAUGHTER ECHOING)

301
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:16,843
Probably the one
in the middle.

302
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,261
The middle, right?

303
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,639
Ahhh! Ow, my leg!
Ow!

304
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,557
Now, before you
fight me, G.I. Joe,

305
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:23,766
you should be warned.

306
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,353
I, Ximxam, have a twin
brother named Mixmax

307
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,605
that feels all my pain.

308
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:31,191
And how is that
supposed to affect us?

309
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,193
Psychologically?

310
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,486
Ahhh!

Sorry.

00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,910
It's pointless to explain.

315
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,829
Hurts so much!

00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,462
Shouldn't have done that.
Ooh.

Nope.
Don't like that sound.

It's as if there's
something about this place

of lame name is that?

something this cool,

your wingpack,
or is it sold separately?

should allow me
to come up with
an oversimplified solution.

00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,310

I have to get something.

347
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,978
What?
The truth.

348
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,783
Oh, crap.

349
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,497
Ah, Jeff, while you were gone,
I figured everything out

350
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,165
and did everything
that needs to be done.

351
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,959
This may be your delusion,
but I'm still the one
on the ball.

352
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,253

I'm unconscious.

353
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,796
Jeff Winger's unconscious,
because he...

354
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,341
I drank a fifth of scotch.

355
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:22,761
And I took some pills.

356
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:25,555

I have three kids.

357
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:26,889
Are you saying you tried to...

358
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,975
No, they were
these stupid youth pills

359
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,851
that I bought in Koreatown.

360
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,938
I took them because
it's my birthday and...

361
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,315
I've been lying about my age.

363

I'm really ready to deal with.

364
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,154

to deal with it unconsciously
through a psychotic break.

Now, these are
the three layers of reality.

00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,535

from the live action layer

368
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,788
by a dangerous mid-layer
called children's
toy commercials,

369
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:51,331
which I believe you're seeing
in your visions.

370

to break this barrier, and...

371
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,293
I'm not going back.

372
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,711
Jeff, you have to go back.

373
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:59,422
I don't wanna be a middle-aged
community college teacher.

374

I wanna be in G.I. Joe.

I wanna fight for freedom
wherever there's
trouble forever.

Jeff, that's
your 10-year-old self talking.

377
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:09,223
You've receded into some
infantile part of your mind.

378

00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,522

is controlling you.
You have to get away from him.

382

That's the point.

real medical jeopardy?

386

in a one-hour drama?

387

00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,897
You have
any more of these pills left?

510
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:09,899
I had the craziest dream.

511
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:11,776
It was all animated

512
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,487
and a <i> G.I. Joe</i> cartoon,
and you were all in it.

513
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,822
In it? How much?

514
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,239
What clothes
did you draw me in?

515
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,908
Hmm, fully animated?

516
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,868
But it was all a dream
because you were unconscious.

517
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,621
Remember that Christmas
when I...
ALL: Yes!

518
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,457
Jeff, here's your present.

519
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,961
Slim pickings
at the hospital gift shop,
but we made do.

520
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,464
(CHUCKLES)

521
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,215
"It's an old boy."

522
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,093
ALL: Yes.
SHIRLEY: He is a old boy.

523
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:39,219
He's an old boy.

524
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,263
Bring it in, guys.
ALL: Aw!

525
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,264
Jeff!

526
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,391
Hey, listen,
I got a former partner

527
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,854
that's been here since '89
in a coma, so... Hmm.

528
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,939
1889?
(ALL LAUGHING)

529
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:52,108
Winger, you're funny.
(CHUCKLES)

530
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,193
(ALL LAUGHING)

531
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,279
(CHATTING INDISTINCTLY)

532
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:02,702
This is cool!
Make my name too.

533
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,371
What are you guys,
cavemen?
BOTH: Buzzkill!

534
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:06,831
What you're doing
is a waste of spray paint.

535
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:09,583
We live in a fascist police
state disguised as democracy.

536
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,377
You think you're gonna
shatter that illusion

537
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,629
by celebrating your own
meaningless identities?

538
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,548
Is church over yet?
CHILDREN: Fourth Wall!

539
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,508
A good syndicated cartoon
has a lesson at the end.

540
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,468
But getting heavy-handed
or preachy could turn

541
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,637
an entire generation
into jaded, sarcastic babies.

542
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,264
Be friendly and direct.
And keep
the message simple.

543
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,017
Graffiti is bad.
Go play sports.

544
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:27,852
Cool!
I get it!

545
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:29,812
I was trying to hold them
to a higher standard.

546
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:32,565
If the media tells kids
what to think,
all they'll know is...

547
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,067
And knowing
is half the battle.
What?

548
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:36,527
ANNOUNCER: <i> G.I. Joe!</i>
