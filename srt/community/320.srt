<i>why record myself</i>
<i>breathing weird</i>

525
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,845
<i>and letting you destroy me.</i>

526
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:21,267
<i>Because I am</i>
<i>a man of honor.</i>

527
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:25,897
<i>So you've earned</i>
<i>the pleasure of my death.</i>

528
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,607
But I didn't.

529
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,149
I'm not the one
that beat you.

530
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,359
PIERCE: Yes, you are.

531
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,988
We're forfeiting.

532
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,490
AUTOMATED VOICE: <i> Warning.</i>
<i>Player forfeit in 30 seconds.</i>

533
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,742
PIERCE:
Gilbert, you're right.

534
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,326
You were more his son
than me.

535
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,870
You took all his crap

536
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:42,789
and you didn't even
get to take his name.

537
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:47,209
He once sat on me in church
just so he could see better.

538
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,963
We've only been
playing this game
a couple of hours.

539
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:52,757
You've been playing it
your whole life,

540
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,675
and now it's time
for your reward, brother.

541
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,137
So get in there
and kill our dad.

542
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,932
Thank you, Pierce.

543
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:03,684
Wait a second.
Here, take this.

544
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,311
(GASPS) Oh!
Whoa!

545
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:06,687
You may need it.
Oh, Pierce.

546
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:09,023
You really don't know how
this works, do you?

547
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:11,109
Are you always
carrying that?

548
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,234
Not in the shower.

549
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,945
(SIGHS)

550
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:15,780
(CLICK, EXPLOSION)

551
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,698
(WINNING MUSIC PLAYING)

552
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,703
(FIREWORKS EXPLODING)

553
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,165
I'd like to thank you
again for today

554
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,542
and offer my apologies
for my conduct.

555
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,961
I wasn't myself.

556
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:32,713
Family can make a person
do a lot of crazy things.

557
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:36,009
I understand.
I have an uncle who
makes his own pizza.

558
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,384
Don't worry about it.
Yeah, totally.

559
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,846
If it would make it up
to any of you in any way,

560
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,305
there's a bar in town
called Skeepers,

561
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,223
and I hear they make
a specialty drink...

562
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:46,060
A margarita, in fact,
and it's served in a glass

563
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,646
an entire yard long.

564
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,272
My treat.
Score.

565
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,483
PIERCE:
This is the greatest day
of my life.

566
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,610
I've always wanted
to have a brother.

567
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,822
Hey, hey,
settle a bet.

568
00:19:57,864 --> 00:20:01,784
The word "mulatto,"
Is it okay or
just borderline?

569
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,161
We apologize for him.

570
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,286
GILBERT:
Oh, that's okay.
He's family.

571
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,171
(TYPING)

572
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,384
Hilda, my love, I said
I'd come back for you.

573
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:25,808
(BABY BABBLING)
ABED: I don't know.

574
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:26,934
I just think that
in a parallel universe,

575
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:29,269
blorgons are...
Hold on.

576
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,815
A baby.
I wasn't expecting this.

577
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,817
Guess we'll have to
support it.

578
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,944
I guess I could get
some kind of job,
maybe at Beans and More.

579
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,404
I'll probably have to work
double shifts, but...

580
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,656
Oh, I see.

581
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:42,366
While you're off,
climbing the ladder
at Beans and More,

582
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:43,534
I'll just stay home
and raise him alone.

583
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:44,994
That's fine. I'll just
give up on my dreams.

584
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:46,746
Here we go.
What?

585
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,831
He needs to learn
a strong man can cry.

586
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,424
So, what were you saying
about blorgons?

587
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,093
Blorgons...
In this other universe,

588
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:01,468
they're actually
called glorbons.
