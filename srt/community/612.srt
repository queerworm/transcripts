00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:51,198
That's a quote directly from
<i>The New York Times</i>, April 4th, 2002.

499
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:56,578
Despite this fact, state laws on incest
remain inconsistent and outdated.

500
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:59,247
I mean, I can make love
to my cousin in Nebraska.

501
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:03,126
If I take her on a date in South Dakota,
I'm looking at 15 years prison time.

502
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,046
<i>I told the </i>Community<i> writers,</i>
<i>"Attention must be paid."</i>

503
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,924
<i>They said they'd allow me to</i>
<i>address it on one condition.</i>

504
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:13,053
At the end of the episode, I must appear
and identify myself as writer.

505
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:16,097
Look, I'm not trying to tell you
how to feel about incest.

506
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:19,851
I'm just letting you know
there's more to it than you've been told.

507
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,353
I'm Briggs Hatton.

508
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:24,856
I wrote the <i>Community</i>
season six incest episode.

509
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,566
Good night.

510
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,653
