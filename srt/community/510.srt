takeaway from last time

that we can use D&amp;D
to reprogram brains?

we almost caused a suicide?

an evil necromancer dwells.

(WATER SLOSHES)
(GASPING)

174
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,441
(SCREAMING) Father!

175
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,359
ABED: If you're
going to continue,

176
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,361
I need Hank, Britta,
Chang, and Dean Pelton
to go into a different room.

177
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,156
Yeah, we're not
going to continue.

178
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:05,573
Thank you very much, guys.

179
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,159
This was just awesome.

180
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:09,368
Yeah, wait, wait, wait.
I'll play your dragon game
with you.

181
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,121
But let's
make it interesting.

182
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:13,957
If I kill the necrophile
before you do,

183
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:16,043
I come
to my grandson's birthday.

184
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,669
We'll settle it like men.

185
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,672
Or whatever you call
the guys that play this.

186
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,049
Okay.

187
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:26,303
But if I kill
the necromancer

188
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:27,929
before you do,

189
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:30,515
then you don't
go to Christmas
or Thanksgiving

190
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:31,683
at Aunt Rachel's.

191
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:32,809
You don't even go to that.

192
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,769
Yeah, but I will
if you don't.

193
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:38,190
Okay, fine.
HANK: Okay.

194
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:39,816
Let the real game begin.

195
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,819
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

196
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,410
I will find you!

197
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,417
Well, I'm assuming
you guys can help me
beat him,

198
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,338
because if we lose,
I'm gonna punch each
of you in the heart.

199
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:07,635
ABED: You awaken
on a muddy riverbank,

200
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,388
surrounded by treacherous,
god-forsaken,

201
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:11,390
non-zipline
vacation jungle.

202
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,475
I build a fire
and construct
a crude wooden rack

203
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,811
to dry my boots
and oversized codpiece.

204
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,563
All right, and I can
make some s'mores

205
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,066
out of horse meat
and s'more horse meat.

206
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,402
Build a fire?
Horse s'mores? Screw this.

207
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,653
The river runs east.
I head west.

208
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,905
Tiny Nuggins scampers
into the jungle.

209
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,907
Hey, pal,
I didn't scamper

210
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,533
in the jungles
of Nicaragua,

211
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,785
and I'm not gonna do it now.

212
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,037
Wait, come back!
I follow him.
Me too.

213
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,664
Tiny Nuggins, if we rest,
we'll regain our strength.

214
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,417
And lose my family.

215
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,835
I'll imaginary sleep
when I'm imaginary dead.

216
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,212
Through the brush
in the distance,

217
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:43,755
you notice a patrol
of half a dozen hobgoblins.

218
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,966
(HOBGOBLIN GROWLS)
Hobgoblins?

219
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,009
Larger, stronger, and
worth more in scrabble
than regular goblins.

220
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,677
Everybody, get down.
I punch him in the heart.

221
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,263
What?
Well, I punch him
in the heart,

222
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:52,597
and I keep running.

223
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,848
There are no women
with them, are there?

224
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,475
I got class.

225
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,810
You charge toward them,
alerting them
to your presence,

226
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,229
and you attack
the nearest one
in the chest.

227
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:00,730
You miss and fall down.
What?

228
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,441
Oh.

229
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,317
The hobgoblins
are heading toward
Nuggins with spears.

230
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:04,484
Oh, no!

231
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,569
Uh, I cast entangle
on them.

232
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,447
Crouton the druid
waves her arms,

233
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,116
causing grass, vines,
and branches

234
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,826
to entangle
the limbs of...

235
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,869
(HOBGOBLINS GROAN)
Four hobgoblins.

236
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,704
(SQUEALS)

237
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,999
The two free hobgoblins
fire arrows at Crouton.
One pierces her shoulder.

238
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,292
(ARROW THWACKS)
Oh!

239
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:21,709
ABED: The other her chest.
Ow!

240
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,128
I fire an arrow at them.

241
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,671
(ARROW WHOOSHES)
Hit.

242
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,508
Ah, these hobgoblins
don't like their odds.

243
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,550
They bolt into the jungle.

244
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,094
Yes.
Yeah, you better run.

245
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,637
Go find a name

246
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,764
that's not just
another creature's name
plus "hob."

247
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:35,765
ABED: Uh-oh.

248
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,728
Crouton?
I'm here.

249
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,773
She was badly wounded
from her fall
in the Skull river,

250
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:46,526
and the arrows
were just too much.
I'm sorry.

251
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,363
That's it?
Is she dead?

252
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,114
Yes, that's it, hickey.

253
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:53,992
I'm dead.
But it's okay.

254
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,410
I'm on your side.

255
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,496
Which is why I'm dead.

256
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,789
And I may be gone,
but just remember

257
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,709
whenever the wind whispers
through the woods,

258
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,585
you got me killed.

259
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,718
Now, you listen to me,
young man.

260
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,304
I've punched about
a thousand hearts
in my life.

261
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:16,931
I never, never missed.

262
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,433
Have you ever been
a three-foot-tall halfling

263
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:19,642
running through
two-foot-high vines,

264
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,436
trying to punch
a seven-foot monster?

265
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,730
I'm gonna go check
on the others.

266
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,190
You might want
to check your character.

267
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:26,733
Or just kind of
generally take
this game seriously.

268
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,109
Your son does.

269
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,363
I take a moment
of silence

270
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:34,782
to mourn my fallen comrade,
Crouton...

271
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,577
Before rifling
through her belongings.

272
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,539
(HUMMING)

273
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,831
What news of my father?

274
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:42,832
You have no way of knowing
where the others are.

275
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,167
Damn it.

276
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:45,710
You're still
traveling north

277
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:46,836
along the narrow
cliff edges of
the Hawthorne mountains.

278
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,296
Okay, I'll roll
for any encounters.

279
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:51,341
I'd like to cast
a healing spell
on Fibrosis.

280
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:53,552
Oh. Thank you.

281
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,471
But I... I'm not gonna
help you kick your dad
out of your life.

282
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,723
I don't think
this competition
is healthy,

283
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,559
and I don't think
what you did back there
was cool.

284
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,769
Look, you think
I'm the bad guy

285
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,938
because I didn't invite him
to my son's birthday.

286
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:08,775
But you know
where he was
for most of my birthdays?

287
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,986
Little place that rhymes
with "not there."

288
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,572
Times Square?

289
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,616
The four of you
hear an ominous screeching.

290
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,452
Moving upward into view,

291
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:21,788
three huge, white arachnids
with eagle wings.

292
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,165
Sky spiders.

293
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,793
I draw my sword
and I cry out...
(SWORD UNSHEATHES)

294
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,503
"Back, eight-legged demons!

295
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,589
"I will not scoop you up
with a catalog

296
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,049
"and let you outside
on this day!"

297
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,718
Stay your blade,
Joseph Gordon.

298
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,805
Sky spiders are
as frightened of us
as we are of them.

299
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,474
Plus they eat
all the sky mosquitoes.

300
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:41,808
Mmm.

301
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:44,894
I cast speak with monsters,
and I say,

302
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:47,606
"Hello.
You're looking well."

303
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:50,733
The lead spider
bends four knees

304
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,068
and twitches
its hairy ovipositor,

305
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,529
rhythmically secreting
and retracting

306
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:57,031
a giant droplet
or drop of silk.

307
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,450
Oh.

308
00:10:58,492 --> 00:10:59,700
Fibrosis, as a ranger,
you recognize this

309
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,869
as the arachnid's signal
of submission.

310
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,913
Oh. Nice work, Tristram.

311
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:07,208
Damn, you made
that sky spider
your bitch, yo!

312
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,380
You've tracked
the hobgoblins
to this shack.

313
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:13,923
One guard
hob-guards the door.

314
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,383
That's what they
call guarding.
Go.

315
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:16,759
Sniper arrow on the guard.

316
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,219
It strikes true.
The guard drops.

317
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:20,263
I move to the doorway.
Detect traps.

318
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,473
None detected.
I enter.

319
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:22,932
Left flank.
Right!

320
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,309
One hobgoblin, facing east.

321
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:25,560
Backstab.
Double damage.

322
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:26,894
Critical hit.
He's dead.

323
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,313
Footsteps behind
the door to the north.

324
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:29,606
I notch two arrows.

325
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:31,608
I climb the walls
to get above the door.

326
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,067
Five goblins enter
from the north.

327
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,402
I fire.
Both arrows hit.

328
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,404
Cleave!
You kill one
and wound another.

329
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,365
I drop on the last one
and grapple.

330
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,907
You got ahold of him.

331
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,159
This one is for crouton.

332
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,701
With his dying breath,
he utters...

333
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:46,498
(CREEPY VOICE)
"The dark lord
will kill you all."

334
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,958
Wait, these things can talk?

335
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,710
I want two taken alive.
I want to try something.

336
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:55,714
Hi. I'm Tiny Nuggins.

337
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,342
I'm gonna put
my dagger down
right here,

338
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,010
so we can just talk.

339
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,388
(GRUNTS) Human trash.

340
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,682
Yeah, look,
I'm gonna give it to
you straight.

341
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,266
We're looking
for a necromancer.

342
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,561
We don't need
two goblins to find him.

343
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:08,769
So between
you and your friend,

the most useful?

Man, your friend
sure can talk.

346
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,819
Liar. He'll never turn.

347
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,239
Oh, yeah,
because of that
famous goblin loyalty.

you just got married.

like your wedding toast.

Golbak said that?

357
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,386
Klang doesn't approve
of you and Lisa, Golbak,

358
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:45,806
and I don't get the sense
it's because of his
feelings for you.

359
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,684
You know,
I think about Lisa,

from your location,

as the hilt of diehard
seeks its blade.

399

The beam arcs
and meets an equal beam
in the woods to the north.

00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:17,991
Too heavy for a bridge?
It breaks.

516
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:19,659
Get hit?
Take damage.

517
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,243
Spend an hour
outside someone's front door,

518
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,787
fighting over who
gets to kill him?

519
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,413
He leaves through the back.

520
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:25,957
He's out there somewhere.

521
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,084
You might find him,
if you get your
crap together.

522
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:30,461
Hey, guys.
Take it from
a bunch of ghosts.

523
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,296
This is no kind of life.

524
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,674
You need fresh air
and frozen yogurt.

525
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,258
It's on me.
(ALL GASPS)

526
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,343
Hug it out.

527
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,552
Oh, see...
Hug it out?

528
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,554
Gag me.
Who even uses that phrase?

529
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,140
All right, I'm climbing down
the ladder. I'm gonna
find this guy.

530
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,808
I stay and search
the workshop.

531
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,309
Does he have any stuff
there that can heal me?

532
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,393
You do find some potions.

533
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,104
Okay, well,
I get half of that.

534
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:49,814
Excuse me, you just
went down the ladder.

535
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,065
Well, I can hear you...

536
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:52,150
Can I hear him
looting upstairs?

537
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,567
Not if I move about
silently.

538
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:57,321
Fine. Fine.
If I heal you,
can we divide the potions?

539
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,406
Okay. But I decide
who gets what.

540
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,659
All right, fine, but
we've gotta be
wary of traps.

541
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,327
I don't have to do a damn
thing that you tell me to do.

542
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,287
What's going on?
Shh.

543
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,831
You outta your mind?
Do you wanna get...
Oh, you give me a break.

544
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,082
The necromancer or not?

545
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,375
Do you want...

546
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,835
(ARGUMENT CONTINUES
IN BACKGROUND)

547
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,503
Do they like each other now?
Are you kidding me?

548
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,630
They can't stand
being in the same room.

549
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:17,175
I also don't think
they can handle being apart.

550
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:22,596
And I think
they just found a way
to avoid doing either.

551
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,978
And that's the best
most fathers and sons
can do.

552
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,688
(GASPS)

553
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,940
(CHOKED UP)
You've made me
so proud today.

554
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,567
Ugh.

555
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,110
Does anyone know
where we can buy
a real sword?

556
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:38,237
Oh, Jeffrey.
(CHUCKLES)

557
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:48,664
You're still at the entrance
to the chamber of grief.

558
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,501
Your move, Mr. Tickles.

559
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:59,425
You successfully pour more tea
into Count Frogula's cup.

560
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,677
That puts it
at Hillary Rodham kitten.

561
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:05,431
Okay, you attempt
to pass crumpets.

562
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,186
You fail.

563
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:12,021
Okay, guys, I'm getting
a little frustrated.

564
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,023
If you'd just take a look
at your inventories,
you'll see that...

565
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:15,441
Abed, are you almost done?

566
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,235
I can't sleep
without my stuffies.

567
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,861
Fine. Hold on.

568
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,573
Oh, a goblin notices you
and murders you all.

569
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:23,824
You're dead.
They're all yours.
