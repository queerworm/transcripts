1
00:00:02,294 --> 00:00:04,546
Hey.
Get out of my chair,
or I'll have you disbarred.

2
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:06,005
Oh, wait.
That already happened.

3
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:08,759
Cash.
Tango.

4
00:00:08,801 --> 00:00:10,344
My old partner
in my new firm.

00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:12,763
(LAUGHS)

6
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:14,598
Does it get any better?

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,724
Not unless you leave.

8
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:17,518
(CHUCKLES)
Still got it.

9
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,812
So a little birdie told me

10
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:21,647
you're graduating
kiddie college.

11
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:23,273
You must be excited
to get that lollipop.

12
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:25,150
Hey.

13
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:26,902
It's a sticker.
Ha.

14
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:29,070
I know you're busy, not,
so allow me to whip it out.

15
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,447
Come work with me.

16
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:31,991
You'll be a full partner,
six figures,

three secretaries.

18
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:34,702
What's that?
Not enough money?

19
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:35,911
I'll double it.
Bam, done.

20
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:37,746
That's how we negotiate.
Lunch?

21
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:39,832
Wow.
I drive a hard bargain.

22
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:42,501
But, Mark,
aren't you worried
I'm a little out of practice?

23
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,295
The only cases
I've tried lately are
about sandwiches and yams.

24
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:46,881
Please, you were
a better lawyer

25
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:49,008
when you weren't a lawyer
than most lawyers I know.

26
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:50,133
It's still in you.

27
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,720
I'll give it some thought.

28
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,639
Just shake
my hand, idiot.
It's simple.

29
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,561
I like simple.

30
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,187
Take a look around, Winger.

31
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:04,481
This is your new old life.

32
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:07,693
I don't get it.
We just had Christmas,
and now it's warm outside.

33
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:10,529
Of course it is, dummy.
We just finished
fall-spring semester.

34
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,447
Bring on summer-winter.

35
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,616
I can't wait.
My final film school class
is just called Opinions.

36
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:16,911
Professor Taylor
is scheduled to teach,
but I have a rebuttal.

37
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:20,372
Lucky. I transferred
to Forensics late and
got the worst classes.

38
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:23,500
Skull fragment collection,
advanced advanced decomp,

39
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:26,045
and intro to senselessness
were all full.

40
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:27,421
I still have a year
of A/C repair left.

41
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,882
I passed all my classes,
so now I just do yoga

42
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:31,050
while the teachers
write down my wisdoms.

43
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,468
Wait a minute.
Jeff passed History.

44
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,845
He's graduating early.

45
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:36,889
I'm totally unprepared
to deal with this.

46
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:38,432
No, Annie,
please, don't...

00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,436
Well, it's official.
It's on a banner.

49
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,021
Congratulations, Jeffrey.

50
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:46,065
You worked hard
not to work hard
to earn that degree.

51
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:48,525
Yeah, you took
so many blow-off classes
and pointless electives.

52
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:49,401
What did you end up
majoring in?

53
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,694
Education.

54
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:51,862
PIERCE: You had to win,
didn't you?

55
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:53,739
When I was inches
from the finish line.

56
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:55,741
Pierce, you have
so many credits,
they have grand-credits.

57
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:56,951
Just graduate already.

58
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,159
When's the
graduation ceremony?

59
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,745
Never.
It's community college.

60
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:02,998
You just send in some papers
and they stop charging you.

61
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,917
It's moving,
in its own way.

62
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,586
So this is it?
A banner and some soda
Troy forgot to bring?

63
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,965
No.
As far as graduations go,
it's boring but grounded.

64
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:12,716
I was hoping for more.

65
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,093
Can we at least
walk with you to
the dean's office?

66
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,469
What, now? No.

67
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,054

I was going to

whenever.

69

Don't be silly.
We started as
a study group,

70
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,350
we'll finish
as a study group.

we can all leave behind.

all the necessary paperwork.

Oh, dean.
I can come back.

No, I can do this.
Just need to sign
the old John dean-cock

91
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:18,740
and you will
be graduated.

92
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,995
So this is it?

93
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:24,746
Mmm-hmm.
Huh.

94
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:28,500

a little more pageantry.

Annie's right.

97
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:34,381
We should throw a party
to mark the occasion.

98
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,590
(SQUEALS)
A small one.

99
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:36,717

a small cake...

00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:39,970
Maybe some flowers,
an archway...

wear a suit.

like a wedding.

Not a wedding.

Tomorrow?

109
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:51,982
Is that enough time
to plan a whole wedding?

00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:53,650
Absolutely.

forward to graduation

a job lined up

Well, then,
let them eat cake.

you know, emotionally.

to graduate, Jeff.

Well,
what about Abed?

125

I mean,
the stress of me leaving
might send him spiraling.

126

Come on,
give him some more credit.

127
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,476
He's really progressed
since he opened up
to my therapizing.

128

when he wouldn't stop

where I lost my arm?

00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,192
And Pierce died,
and Annie went insane,

132
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:37,194
and he blamed it all
on you throwing some dice.

133
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:38,653
He has not brought
that up in months.

You're right, Britta.

to give Abed a chance.

Astronomy next semester.

on a number.

you dropped that cake.

Hey.
What's going on?

179
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:34,061
Why are you trying
to avoid graduating?

180
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,478
I wish I knew.

181
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,897
I think it's because
you're scared

182
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,066
to take this law job
with your old partner.

183
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,235
But don't let that
stop you from graduating.

184
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:42,819
Take the job,
don't take the job.

185
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,445
Either way, your friends
are always going

186
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,739
to be here
to support you.

187
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,907
Good to know.

188
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,407
See you at graduation.

189
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,661
And they call us
the worst.

190
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:52,913
Took you long enough.

191
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,581
Hey, nobody said
you had to travel naked.

192
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,250
Oh. You brought the good one.

193
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,501
You hold that,
I'll do the sleeve.

194
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,962

There...

195
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,421
Ah. Good.

Middle finger
works great now.

197
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,303
It's worse
than I thought.

198
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:11,098
They made lame Jeff
too lame to leave Greendale.

199
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,682
He's got to take that job.

200
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,434
But how do we
make him do that?

201
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,395
By turning the
study group against him

202
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,439
so he'll run screaming
from this rancid cocoon

203
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,566
into the welcoming arms
of darkness.

204
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,277
How hard is that
to understand?

205
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,652
It's not.

206
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,280
I just like
when you talk down
to me like a child.

Oh! Jeff.

210
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:35,414
It's bad luck
to see the graduation
before the graduation.

211
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,664
I had to talk to you.

212
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,584
Today is bringing up
so many emotions.

213
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:40,794
It's a lot
to take in.

214
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,254
I'm not making you
feel nervous

215
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:43,797
about graduating,
am I?

216
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,466
Well, you are making me
feel something.

217
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,469
And it's not
about graduating.

218
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,721
I'm saying
I'm hot for you.

219
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,098
Me?

220
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,434
Is this for real?

221
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,560
Is my beating heart
for real?

222
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,770
Oh, Annie.

223
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,814
I don't know if it's
the beautiful decorations,

224
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,191
or the impending
floral archway,

225
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:06,278
but there's
something about this
that feels so right.

226
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,031
It's the perfect moment
to remember you by.

227
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,699
Remember me by?

228
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,118
I'm not going anywhere.

229
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,995
Exactly.
You're going nowhere.

230
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:18,623
I'm about to
return to my cool,
adult, lawyer life,

231
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,667
and you're going
to be stuck here,
playing high school.

232
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:21,960
Why are you saying this?

233
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,211
So you face the facts.

234
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,755
Once I graduate,
I'm gone.

235
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,471
Winger,
streaking on your
last day of school?

236
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,181
Respect.

237
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,183
Oh, so I got
the save the date
for your graduation.

238
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,643
Should I bring a date,
or try to hook up there?

239
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,854
I'm not going to your
stupid graduation, jerk.

240
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,357
I can't believe you said
those things to me.

241
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,066
What things?
Don't play dumb.

242
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,401
You want to leave? Leave.

243
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:47,444
See if I care.

244
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:49,154
What did you do?

245
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,239
I have no earthly idea.

246
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:53,867
Hook up there.

247
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,832
Hello, Abed.
Hello, Evil Jeff.

248
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,209
What?
How did you...

249
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,044
I may not be good
with facial expressions,

250
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,586
but I know
an evil doppelganger
when I see one.

251
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,172
Plus your arm makes a noise
every time you move it.

252
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,507
Silence.
(MECHANICAL ARM WHIRRING)

253
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,716
Are you here
to kill Jeff?

254
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:12,052
Oh, you non-evils
are so naive.

255
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,470
I'm here to save Jeff

256
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:15,972
from the smothering teat
of his study group.

257
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,225
Is that a paintball gun?
You wish.

258
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,730
Cool.

259
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,857
Wait. Cold.

Hi.

263
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:38,661
Out of my chair, monkey.

267
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:56,471
Um, okay,
let's start with "huh?"

268
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,891
Jeff, I'm sorry.
I made it all up.

269
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,227
I've been so upset
about you graduating

270
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:05,021
that I've gone
a little crazy, emotionally.

271
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,023
Oh, good.
I thought I was
losing my mind.

272
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,733
Make it up to you
with a hug?

273
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,242
This breakfast sandwich cart
is such a great idea.

274
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:18,826
It's never
too early for Shirley...

275
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,661
To make a boatload off
of hung over college kids.

276
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,622
Speaking of
great idea having,
hear me out.

277
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:25,875
It's called
"the Troy-jan horse."

278
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:30,046
It goes bread,
lettuce, ham, ham,
bacon, chocolate...

279
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,965
Oh, how you doing,
the graduate?

280
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,301
Just stopping by
to hand out some un-vites

281
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,718
to my graduation.

282
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,720
Here's one for
the desperate housewife

283
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,181
who spends more time
with her pathetic business

284
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:41,308
than with her family.

285
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,934
And you.

286
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,395
If you call a sandwich
a "Troy-jan horse,"

287
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:47,230
people are
going to think
there's horse in it.

288
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:50,191
Oh, my dreams.

289
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:53,069
Whatever, losers.
See you never.

290
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,654
Where's Abed?

291
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:57,824
Is anyone here?

292
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:00,034
Hello, Abed.
Welcome to our home.

293
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,078
Hello, Evil Abed.
It's just Abed now.

294
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,830
After we met,
I abandoned my evil goal

295
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,624
to focus on brightening
my own timeline instead.

296
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,417
Do you live here alone?
Yes.

297
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,544
Evil Troy moved out
when I gave up the cause.

298
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,004
Now he only listens
to Evil Jeff,

299
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,964
who sort of took over
this year, villain-wise.

300
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,633
Jeff left Greendale
and became a scummy
lawyer again,

301
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:16,009
but the more evil
he got,

302
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,594
the more he became
tortured by the idea

303
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:18,928
that there's still
a good Jeff out there,

304
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,514
being good somewhere.

305
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:21,556
That's why he forced me
to show him

306
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:22,807
how to travel
between timelines.

307
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,018
My God.
This is so cool.

308
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,478
I know.
You have no idea

309
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,104
how long I've been waiting
to talk to you about it.

310
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,023
Kind of a <i> Superman III</i>
meets that <i> Star Trek</i> episode

311
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,149
meets season three
of <i> The Cape.</i>

312
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,984
<i>The Cape</i> was cancelled.
Not here.

313
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,778
They retooled it for cable,
and it's awesome.

314
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,030
Want to see it?

315
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,490
Desperately.

316
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:40,325
But I need to get
back to my timeline
and stop Evil Jeff.

317
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,327
So I came to the only person
who could help me. Me.

318
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:43,662
I'll get you home, Abed.

319
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:46,623
But first,
you'll need some supplies.

320
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,464
Everyone must be
running late.

321
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:56,715
Here, Jeffrey.
You're graduated.

322
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,843
Take your precious diploma
and just go.

323
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,429
I cannot believe
the hurtful things

324
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:02,639
you said to me
in my office.

325
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:03,890
I'll have you know

326
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,684
that wanting
a little pageantry
in your life

327
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:08,853
isn't a crime
or a lifestyle choice.

328
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:16,277
Okay, Annie,
something definitely
weird is happening.

329
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,154
No one's here,
the dean is mad at me,

330
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:20,448
and he is never
mad at me, and...

331
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,116
A third reason.

332
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,702
Congratulations, Jeff.

333
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:25,078
Don't worry
about the study group.

334
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,246
You can talk
to them later.

335
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,497
Why don't you and I
go celebrate

336
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:30,291
someplace private
and boozy?

337
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,835
Annie, why are you
acting like a mistress
in a lifetime movie?

338
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,671
(LAUGHS)
You're funny.

339
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:37,424
Oh, sweetheart,
you dropped
your phone earlier.

340
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,134
You've got a voicemail
from a guy named Mark?

341
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,720
You should call him.

342
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,804
Not now.
I have to find the others
and figure this out.

343
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,181
Crap.
We're losing him.

What?

345
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:48,727
BOTH: Who are you?

346
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,437
You're me?

347
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,439
But how?
But how?

348
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,814
Enough of the pleasantries.

349
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,108
I've come
from the Darkest Timeline

350
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,068
to make sure
you take that job.

351
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,195
It's essential
to our future.

352
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:00,988
You want it, idiot,
so take it.

353
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,575
I can't. I've spent
almost four years here,

354
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,577
growing and changing
and making dioramas.

355
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,495
I'm not that
guy anymore.

356
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:10,582
You're wrong.
Greendale may have dulled
your killer instinct,

357
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:13,000
but trust me,
it's still in you.

358
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:16,713
It's time to leave this place
and reclaim your proper life.

359
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:19,966
No. Not without
my study group.

360
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,427
Ugh. Now who's
in a lifetime movie?

361
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,638
Then I'll be rid of you
another way.

362
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:32,853
Friendship!

363
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,737
Mmm. Cold.

364
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,739
Well,
the subtle approach failed.

365
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:45,450
What's next?
Explain it slowly.

366
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:48,161
Need some help?

367
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,622
Let's burn this mother down.

368
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,005
Jeff must be
graduating about now.

369
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,340
I wonder
if anyone's there.

370
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,800
Doubt he cares.

371
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,593
Pierce won't even
respond to my texts.

372
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,720
I wonder what terrible things
Jeff said about him.

373
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,054
I've got some guesses.

374

(ALL GASPING)
Let me finish.

375
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,184
Look, I know
this may sound crazy,

376
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,851
and more
than a little convenient,

377
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,313
but whatever I said to you,
it wasn't me.

378
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,397
It was Evil Jeff.

379
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,274
(SCOFFS) Come on.

380
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:20,026
Something happened
when I rolled that die.

381
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,944
Something terrible.
Something only nerds
can understand.

382
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,238
Mmm-hmm.
You have to believe me.

383
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,406
They're coming for us.

384
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:26,866
No.

385
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,202
We're coming for them.

386
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,745
Abed,
where have you been?

387
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:31,871
You guys never believe me,
so this time,

388
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,581

to prove to all of you...

391
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,838
Whoa.

392
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,589
Actually, I figured that
these paintball warping guns
would convince you.

393
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,883
Listen up, people.
We've got an inter-dimensional
battle on our hands.

394
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,552
Our evil counterparts
are waging a war,

395
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,428
and it's either us or us.

396
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,888
All right.

397
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,891
Let's light up
these dark suckers.

398
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,810
Okay, everyone.
Stay sharp.

399

If you see yourself,
warp on sight.

400
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:59,816
I'd like to warp myself
to a dairy-free mudslide.

401
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:01,192
That's just vodka, Shirley.

402
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,276
I know what it is.

403
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,444
MAN: Ah-ha.

404
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:05,697
Pierce? We thought
you were dead.

405
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:08,825
Hell, no.
After I got shot,
I faked my death

406
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,493
to teach
you all a lesson.

407
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,078
Lesson about what?

408
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,747
Who can remember?
It was more than a year ago.

409
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:16,207
And yet,
here you all are,

without me.

Again,
we thought you were dead.

beat the lame study group.

413
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,549
Just tell me
how this works.

414
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:27,176
Fine.
It's complicated,
but basically,

415
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:29,888

to shoot themselves wins.

Winner.

Well, that bow
tied itself.

on my coat.

420
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,020
Dang, it's spreading.

421
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,231
Damn it, Britta.
Did you shoot yourself too?

422
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,442
Every time.
Hey.

423
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,235
Don't talk to her
like that.

424
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,153
Every time.

425
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,697
We're here. Scatter.

426
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:56,623
Get help.

427
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,377
Can't hide forever,
lame Annie.

428
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:02,587
Just let me shoot you.

with Jeff there.

Nobody sleeps with Jeff.

Not even me.

I've been
counting bullets.
One of us is out.

Is it you?
Yes.

439
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,321
Why would you
tell me that?

440
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,281
To sound intimidating.

441
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:37,497

Okay.

You've got
to take him out.

446

Why don't I just give him
what he wants?

What?
You can't give up now.

Why not?
Because it's not real.

Look around, Jeff.

450
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,222
Haven't you noticed
the vending machines

451
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,891
are full of meats
and hard-boiled eggs?

455
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:04,565
Yeah.

created in your own mind.

is within.

Greendale has
changed you too much.

460
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,199
So part of you
wants Evil Jeff to win,

461
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,534
because then you could
go backwards and pretend

462
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:15,827
you're the same guy
you were four years ago.

463

If this is all
in my mind,

then I don't really
need to fight him.

away from me.

changed my life.

Whatever.

I'm so used
to being the guy

who can talk his way
out of anything,

when you don't
want a way out?

for me is indescribable.

is immeasurable,

split it seven ways.

into some small local firms.

00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,366
I can pop by
any time I want.

522
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,535
You know, just to settle
any group arguments

523
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:03,786
about who
misses me the most.

524
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,579
Oh...

525
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:06,747
What do you think?

526
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,248
To Jeff.
To Jeffrey.

528
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,762
Welcome back.

529
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,472
We've got a jam-packed show,
so let's get started.

530
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:25,474
Today, as always,
we'll be visited
once again

531
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:28,268
by Greendale's king
and supreme lord master,
Dean Chang.

532
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,270
Looks like
he'll be talking
about squash this time.

533
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:31,772
Oh, I'm super excited
for that.

534
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:34,150
And not only
because it's mandatory.

535
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:35,902
But first,
we'll take a spin
around the Timeline map

536
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:39,072
and find out what's
happening in the universes
that parallel ours.

537
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,116
Thanks, us.

538
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:43,201
I'm standing here
in Timeline five,

539
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,618
where things
are pretty much normal.

540
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,037
Normal?

541
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,830
Troy, people are
on fire in Nairobi.

542
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:49,540
You call that normal?

543
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,876
I've become much more
conscious of world issues

544
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:55,129
since Troy and I
decided to give our
baby an African name.

545
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,381
Isn't that right, Chewbacca?

546
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:58,925
It means,
"He who hunts bounties."

547
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,134
Back to you.

548
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:04,805
Wow, it sounds like
things are really
heating up in Nairobi.

549
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,933
That's nothing
compared to the fire
in our studio audience.

550
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,102
Hey, idiots.

551
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:10,310
How many times
have I told you,

552
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,854
the show doesn't
really exist.

553
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,814
No one's watching.

554
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:15,399
Duh-doy. We know.

555
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:16,776
Yeah, we're just
messing around.

556
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:17,860
See you at lunch,
Evil Jeff.

557
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:19,237
See you at lunch.
