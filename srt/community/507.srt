00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:14,809
(CHUCKLES)

177
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,567
I said I was sorry.
(LAUGHS)

178
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,527
I'm sorry
I punched my landlord,

179
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,654
but I'm not gettin'
my deposit back.

180
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,073
That's an example
of you being punished

181
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,283
for choosing
to hurt someone.

182
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:30,617
I wrecked your papers
by accident.

183
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:33,328
You chose to spray
this crap on purpose

184
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,414
because you didn't care
what happened.

185
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,539
You know,
let me tell you something.

186
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,292
For five years,
I have watched people

187
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,043
walk around
on your eggshells.

188
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:43,463
"Oh, Abed.
He's so imaginative,
so magical.

189
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,215
"Everybody hide
their hamburgers!

190
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:48,343
"If Abed sees a hamburger,
we'll all travel in time.

191
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,304
"Let's eat cookies
and ice cream

192
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,555
"and dress in pajamas
in the middle of the day."

193
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:55,475
I watched
my third wife die!

194
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,397
You think I'm spoiled?
(LAUGHS)

195
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,190
And you think
I'm spoiled because
it's never occurred

196
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,151
to anyone to do this?

197
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,902
You're not the Marco Polo
of bullying me.

198
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,904
You're just another
tourist taking pictures
of a great, big wall.

199
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,530
Oh, you're gonna
make me cry.

200
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:10,991
When's the last time someone
physically limited you?

201
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,409
Oh, just now.

202
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:15,078
You physically
ruined my drawings.

203
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,498
Drawings of what?

204
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,542
You're an artist?

205
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,380
I destroyed
something valuable?

206
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,760
Looked like you
were doodling chickens.

207
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,804
He is a duck!

208
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,389
Uh-oh.

209
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,808
(APPLAUSE)

210
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,726
(EXHALES)
Hey!

211
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,355
You're not allowed in there.

212
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,564
Well, I just did
a one-man show

213
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,317
for a little audience
that would beg to disagree.

214
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:48,236
Audience?
In there?

215
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,864
We haven't had a single
person or performance

216
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:54,993
in that theater
since the 1997 fire.

217
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,953
24 people died.

218
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,290
So what have
you guys been up to?

219
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:01,624
Well, this.
Raising money.

220
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,418
Organizing.
Trying to make a difference.

221
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,463
I'm impressed,
and embarrassed.
I sold out.

222
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:07,964
We sold out.
You did not sell out.

223
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,842
I'm going to
community college
to start a career.

224
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,135
We're in real estate.

225
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:14,471
We own the building
we're standing in.

226
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:16,556
Wow.
You guys did sell out!

227
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,599
I know!
(ALL LAUGHING)

228
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,810
I should introduce
myself to her friends.

229
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:22,145
I knew it!

230
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,771
You don't have
a drinking problem!

231
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,316
You have feelings for Britta,
you disgusting monster!

232
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,109
Fine. Yes.

233
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,277
Something about
everybody liking her
turns me on.

234
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:30,695
Ugh.
It's a problem I have.

235
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,114
I hated Reese's pieces
before ET. Ate them, sorry.

236
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,491
You're a bad friend!

237
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:36,368
That's not fair!

238
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:39,079
Wait, that's really not fair.
You're a terrible friend.

239
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,580
She was mine first.

240
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:41,789
And it's not like
she belongs to anybody.

241
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,124
Oh, here we go.

242
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,419
"Love isn't a game,"
say the guys that always win.

243
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,587
And now, you're going
to go pull a Dane Cook

244
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,297
in one of those
three movies he was in

245
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,591
about Dane Cook
getting laid by accident.

246
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:54,719
Only it's not
a Dane Cook movie, Jeff,

247
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:58,390
because this time,
someone's watching me.

248
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:01,226
Your friend,
British Jason Biggs.

249
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:04,604
If you never
call me Dane Cook again,
I'll stand down.

250
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,398
For an hour.

251
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,608
Okay. An hour.

252
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,448
Are your duck
drawings a secret?

253
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,074
Is that why you do 'em
when nobody's around?

254
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,700
Not that it's
any of your business,

255
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,161
but I am a cartoonist
in my spare time.

256
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,914
My cartoon's about a duck.
I was drawing him.

257
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,417
Does the duck have a name?
Does he have powers?

258
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,710
I'm not pitching to you.

259
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,129
You're afraid
I won't like it.

260
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,505
Sure.

261
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,882
I've been a cab driver,
a soldier, a cop,

262
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:35,718
but what terrifies me
the most is the opinion

263
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,845
of a manchild
in cardboard pants.

264
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,723
Kickpuncher was a cop
before he became a cyborg.

265
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,768
So you were a cop
before you became this.

266
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:48,356
And what were
you before this?
Were you normal?

267
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:51,318
Or do you act like this
because somebody
stuffed you in a locker?

268
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,069
Is that the idea?
Other way around.

269
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:55,447
What else do you
want to know about me?

270
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:56,697
What makes you
stop talking.

271
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,366
Letting me go.
After you miss your movie.

272
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,243
Because you
want me to suffer.

273
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,912
For destroying
your duck cartoons?

274
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:04,122
The ones you're ashamed of?

275
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,687
(CHUCKLES)

276
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,689
Uh, which one
were you laughing at?

277
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,775
(APPLAUSE)

278
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,819
No, no, no, no, no!
Stop that!

279
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,321
You're ghosts!

280
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,864
We're ghosts?

281
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,283
The janitor out there
told me you died in 1997.

282
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,160
Janitor?

283
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,122
Hey!

284
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:48,208
Those guys in there told me
that you're the one
that died in a fire

285
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,459
and you're a ghost!

286
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:52,086
And you just believed 'em?

287
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,797
You just believed
a bunch of ghosts?

288
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,091
(LAUGHS)

289
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,427
(SCREAMING)

290
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,265
(GASPS)
Have you guys

291
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:07,768
seen that billboard
on Water Street
for <i> Consensual</i> perfume?

292
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,688
The one with the man chasing
the woman through the grass

293
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,314
and it says,
"Proven in its field"?

294
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,524
Yeah, proven in its field

295
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:14,817
and in labs on
the eyeballs of rabbits.

296
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,654
We should make it say that!
Who's got the spray paint?

297
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,364
(LAUGHTER)

298
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:20,990
No, guys, I'm serious!

299
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:23,034
Doug and Janet,
you're on lookout.

300
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:26,246
Michael works the ladder.
I will banksy that mother!

301
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:29,040
Come on, guys, we gotta
start taking risks again.

302
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:32,126
Well, that's convenient for
the one with nothing to lose.

303
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:38,883
Oh, so the person
with the least wealth has
the least valid argument?

304
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,719
That's convenient.

305
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,888
Britta, how many people
have you fed this year
besides yourself?

306
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,056
Oh, Janet...
No, look.

307
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,183
I've spent enough
time feeling bad.

308
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,689
(MOCKING)
Fight the power!

309
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:53,940
(ALL SNICKERING)

310
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,412
Would you like to go...

311
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:08,913
Yeah.
Yeah?

312
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,082
Oh, my God.

313
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:16,296
(WATCH BEEPS)
(CHUCKLES)

314
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,847
These are really good.

315
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,976
It helps me to see
why you were so upset.

316
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,519
Did I ruin anything
as good as what's in here?

317
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:33,480
Ah, just practice drawings.

318
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,566
I have to practice
drawing the duck
from different angles.

319
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:39,235
It's hard when his back's
turned three quarters
because of the beak.

320
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,612
Well...

321
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,281
I'm a real jerk
for wrecking it.

322
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,783
Ah, you didn't do it
on purpose.

323
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,033
That doesn't
excuse my behavior.

324
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,786
No, I appreciate that.

325
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,828
It's a good apology.
You're a good kid.

326
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,710
All right. Well...

327
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,712
I can see from
the clock that if I hit
all the green lights...

328
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:58,921
I'm sorry,
I can't let you go.

329
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,674
That'd undercut
the larger lesson.

330
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,258
Yes, the lesson being
that you're very talented.

331
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,177
But I have this thing.
I can't walk into a movie...

332
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,762
You're not
going to the movie.

333
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,224
Yes, I am.

334
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,059
You need this.
Let me go!

335
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,479
This is you learning.

336
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,481
You're a bad person
and a bad cartoonist.

337
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:19,025
You go ahead.
Hurt my feelings.

338
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,401
Oh! You have feelings, huh?

339
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,069
Have you considered
putting them into your work?

340
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,197
Your cartoons are
monuments to joylessness,

341
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,948
nervously assembled
jokes based on nothing
from your life

342
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,158
or anyone's life!

343
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,493
You're furious at me
for being creative

344
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:29,828
because you want to
be able to create.

345
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,496
You have all this rage
and shame and loneliness,

346
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,122
which I don't
even know how to feel
much less understand,

347
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,499
