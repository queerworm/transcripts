00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,502
[narrator] 
NOW THE STORY

2
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:04,337
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY 
WHO LOST EVERYTHING...

3
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:05,796
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE...

4
00:00:05,796 --> 00:00:07,132
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:15,640
IT'S ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

6
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:20,603
[narrator] 
IT WAS MONDAY MORNING,

7
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:22,897
AND MICHAEL BLUTH 
WAS NERVOUS ABOUT MEETING...

8
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:25,441
WITH THE NEW PROSECUTOR 
OF HIS FATHER'S CRIMINAL CASE.

9
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:27,735
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE 
SO NERVOUS ABOUT, MICHAEL.

10
00:00:27,735 --> 00:00:29,987
IT'S A NEW PROSECUTOR. 
IT'S A WHOLE NEW BEGINNING,

11
00:00:29,987 --> 00:00:33,241
A NEW DAY, A NEW CASE, 
A WHOLE NEW SET OF LIES.

12
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:34,450
- I'M NOT LYING ANYMORE, MOM.

13
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,036
[narrator] 
MICHAEL WAS LYING.

14
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,163
HE FOUND HIS FUGITIVE FATHER 
EARLIER IN THE WEEK,

15
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,206
AND HE WAS HIDING HIM 
IN THE ATTIC...

16
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,832
WHERE GEORGE SR. 
WAS CURRENTLY WAITING

17
00:00:41,832 --> 00:00:43,293
FOR HIS BREAKFAST.

18
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,378
- ABOUT THE BUSINESS, 
JUST FOR THE RECORD,

19
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:48,047
I WAS NOT INVOLVED WITH DAD 
BUILDING HOUSES IN IRAQ.

20
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:49,840
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT 
I'M GONNA TELL THEM.

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,551
- IS THAT FOR LINDSAY?

22
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,678
BECAUSE SHE'S NOT SCARED 
TO EAT IN FRONT OF ME ANYMORE.

23
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:55,180
THOSE ARE 
THE WHITES ONLY, YES?

24
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,848
- THESE AREN'T FOR LINDSAY. 
THESE ARE MINE.

25
00:00:57,848 --> 00:00:59,809
- ANYWAY, I'M NOT LYING 
ANYMORE EITHER, MICHAEL.

26
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,853
I'M BEING LIED...

27
00:01:02,853 --> 00:01:04,814
ON. 
- [gasps]

28
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,899
- WOW. NOW MORE'S GONNA 
COME UP THAN GO DOWN.

29
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:11,321
- I GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE.

30
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,572
- HMM?

31
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,240
- I CAN'T 
TAKE THIS ANYMORE.

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,411
I MEAN, SHE'S JUST 
SO LOVING AND AFFECTIONATE.

33
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,746
I-- I-- THIS IS NOT 
THE WOMAN I FELL IN LOVE WITH.

34
00:01:20,746 --> 00:01:22,915
- OSCAR, PLEASE. YOU CAN'T GO. 
YOU GOTTA STAY, OKAY?

35
00:01:22,915 --> 00:01:24,792
THIS IS THE NICEST SHE'S BEEN 
SINCE SHE FOUND OUT

36
00:01:24,792 --> 00:01:26,169
ROSA COULD BREAST-FEED BUSTER.

37
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,837
- OH, BUSTER, DON'T EVEN 
BRING THAT UP.

38
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:29,214
HE'S WELL INTO 
HIS ARMY TRAINING.

39
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,090
[narrator] 
ACTUALLY, BUSTER HAD HIT A WALL

40
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,383
IN HIS ARMY TRAINING.

41
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:34,177
- I CAN'T DO IT!

42
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,095
I CAN'T MAKE MY BED, 
AND I CAN'T DO THIS EITHER!

43
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:38,264
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO YELL 
AT ME AND CALL ME "HOMO"

44
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,350
AND MOTIVATE ME OVER THIS WALL?

45
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,017
- WE CAN'T DO THAT ANYMORE. 
LAWSUIT.

46
00:01:42,017 --> 00:01:43,686
[narrator] 
IN FACT,

47
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,938
IT WAS A RECENT RULING... 
PROSECUTED BY THE SAME MAN

48
00:01:45,938 --> 00:01:48,316
WHO MICHAEL WAS SOON 
TO MEET WITH.

49
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,900
- IT'S GOING TO BE 
A LONG TIME BEFORE

50
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,736
SERGEANT WENDELL BAKER... 
CALLS SOMEONE

51
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:53,904
"PRIVATE HOMO" AGAIN.

52
00:01:53,904 --> 00:01:56,031
- GOD WILLING, 
HE'LL FAIL BOOT CAMP.

53
00:01:56,031 --> 00:01:58,576
- WELL, WHY WOULDN'T HE? 
HE ALREADY FAILED DAY CAMP.

54
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:01,204
HEY. 
- HI. HEY, DAD.

55
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,413
YOU READY FOR THE PROSECUTOR?

56
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,290
- HI. 
I HOPE SO.

57
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,667
HOW'D THAT MATH TEST WORK OUT? 
- OH, IT WAS OKAY, I GUESS.

58
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:08,002
BUT-- I DON'T KNOW.

59
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,337
IT WAS WEIRD. 
I STUDIED WITH ANN,

60
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:10,963
BUT I STILL GOT A B-MINUS.

61
00:02:10,963 --> 00:02:12,590
- ANN GOT YOU A B-MINUS?

62
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,718
- WELL, IT WASN'T ANN. 
SHE'S AN EXPERT IN MATH.

63
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:18,053
ISN'T THAT CUTE? 
- IS IT?

64
00:02:18,053 --> 00:02:19,472
[narrator] 
MICHAEL FELT HIS SON

65
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:20,806
WAS SETTING THE BAR TOO LOW...

66
00:02:20,806 --> 00:02:22,600
WITH HIS DATING STANDARDS.

67
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,560
- NO, IT WASN'T ANN'S FAULT.

68
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,814
I THINK I JUST ENDED UP THINKIN' 
ABOUT THE QUESTIONS TOO LONG.

69
00:02:28,814 --> 00:02:30,608
AND SO, BY THE TIME 
I PUT AN ANSWER DOWN,

70
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:31,984
I WENT WITH, LIKE, 
MY FIFTH CHOICE

71
00:02:31,984 --> 00:02:33,611
OR SOMETHIN' LIKE THAT.

72
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,821
- GEORGE MICHAEL, 
NEVER SETTLE FOR FIFTH CHOICE.

73
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:37,365
SOMETHING BETTER 
IS GONNA COME ALONG.

74
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:38,866
SHE JUST HAS TO.

75
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:40,701
- I THINK MAYBE SITTING 
IN THE BACK OF THE CLASS

76
00:02:40,701 --> 00:02:42,245
WITH ANN IS A BAD IDEA.

77
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,913
YOU KNOW, 
SHE'S JUST SO PRETTY.

78
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,165
I GET DISTRACTED, 
I GUESS.

79
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,666
- DO YOU?

80
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,918
- I WISH 
I COULD DRAW HER NOSE.

81
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:51,421
- MAYBE IT'S YOUR EYES.

82
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,298
MAYBE YOU NEED GLASSES... 
FOR YOUR GRADES.

83
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,508
DIDN'T YOU SAY YOU HAD 
A HARD TIME READIN' THE BOARD...

84
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,092
SITTIN' IN THE BACK ROW?

85
00:02:57,092 --> 00:02:58,844
- NO, I SAID I WAS 
IN THE BACK OF THE CLASSROOM.

86
00:02:58,844 --> 00:02:59,887
- THAT'S WHAT 
I MEAN. YEAH?

87
00:02:59,887 --> 00:03:01,096
- IT'S DIFFERENT. NO. NO.

88
00:03:01,096 --> 00:03:02,682
WELL, I DON'T KNOW. 
MAYBE.

89
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,475
- NO, DEFINITELY. 
I'LL CALL THE EYE DOCTOR.

90
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,060
- I GUESS.

91
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,853
- I'M GONNA SET YOU UP 
AN APPOINTMENT. OKAY?

92
00:03:07,853 --> 00:03:09,689
- HEY, GANG. 
- TOBIAS.

93
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,649
- OH. OOH, I'M AFRAID 
I'LL HAVE TO TAKE THEM TO GO.

94
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,025
I'M LATE FOR THE GYM.

95
00:03:13,025 --> 00:03:14,777
OH, AND ALSO, 
HERE'S A NUMBER...

96
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:17,905
IN CASE THE BLUE MAN GROUP 
CALLS AND NEEDS AN UNDERSTUDY.

97
00:03:17,905 --> 00:03:20,575
I JUST FOUND OUT THAT MY 
CELLULAR TELEPHONE WAS A LEMON.

98
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,742
IT DIDN'T WORK.

99
00:03:21,742 --> 00:03:23,077
- [hoarse voice] 
NEITHER DO YOU.

100
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,329
- [scoffs]

101
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,996
- PRETTY BRAVE CARD 
FOR YOU TO PLAY.

102
00:03:25,996 --> 00:03:27,998
- I JUST CAN'T STAND IT. 
TOBIAS GETTING IN SHAPE...

103
00:03:27,998 --> 00:03:29,292
[door closing]

104
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,210
FOR A BUNCH 
OF SLUTTY GYM RATS.

105
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,671
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR VOICE? 
- NOTHING. I'VE BEEN GOING OUT.

106
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,340
[narrator] 
LINDSAY HAD BEEN

107
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,467
FREQUENTING SINGLES CLUBS, 
ALSO STILL HOPING TO MAKE

108
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,593
HER OPEN MARRIAGE WORK--

109
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:39,802
- WHOO!

110
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,304
[narrator] 
WHICH IT WON'T.

111
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:44,098
- I DIDN'T CATCH THAT. 
- WHOO!

112
00:03:47,643 --> 00:03:50,145
I WONDER HOW MANY WOMEN 
HE'S SLEPT WITH, IF ANY.

113
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:52,147
- LINDSAY, IT'S NOT 
A COMPETITION.

114
00:03:52,147 --> 00:03:54,442
- OF COURSE IT IS, MICHAEL. 
THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT SCORING.

115
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,151
- MAYBE IN THE '70s.

116
00:03:56,151 --> 00:03:58,153
- THAT MANY? WE'VE ONLY 
BEEN DOING THIS FOR A MONTH.

117
00:03:58,153 --> 00:03:59,614
- INSTEAD OF COMPETING 
WITH TOBIAS,

118
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:00,990
WHY DON'T YOU TRY SPENDING...

119
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,533
A LITTLE MORE TIME 
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER?

120
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,576
- WHY? TOBIAS DOING THAT?

121
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,952
[narrator] 
AT THAT MOMENT,

122
00:04:04,952 --> 00:04:06,621
LINDSAY'S DAUGHTER... 
[doorbell rings]

123
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,205
WAS IN THE PROCESS 
OF WOOING HER OWN MAN.

124
00:04:08,205 --> 00:04:09,374
- WHO IS IT?

125
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,625
- STEVE HOLT!

126
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,252
[narrator] 
MAEBY HAD EVEN STARTED

127
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,753
ORDERING UNNECESSARY ITEMS...

128
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,505
JUST TO HAVE MORE OCCASIONS 
TO SEE HIM.

129
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,797
- UH, YOU ORDERED

130
00:04:16,797 --> 00:04:18,341
A "MEMORIES OF THANKSGIVING" 
BASKET?

131
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,842
- WOW, THAT LOOKS GREAT.

132
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:21,927
- [hoarsely] 
MAEBY, WHO'S YOUR FRIEND?

133
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:24,972
- IS THIS YOUR SISTER? 
- NO.

134
00:04:24,972 --> 00:04:27,182
BUT YOU JUST MADE MY DAY.

135
00:04:27,182 --> 00:04:29,852
- THANK YOU FOR THE BASKET. 
SEE YA.

136
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,898
- [singsong] 
HE THINKS I'M CUTE.

137
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,692
- HE'S 19. HE'S A SENIOR 
AT MY HIGH SCHOOL.

138
00:04:36,692 --> 00:04:39,320
[narrator] 
AND HAD BEEN FOR SEVERAL YEARS.

139
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,285
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

140
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,912
I THINK I AM GONNA SPEND 
MORE TIME WITH MY DAUGHTER.

141
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:53,000
- I CAN'T PROMISE YOU I WON'T 
TELL THE PROSECUTOR ABOUT THAT.

142
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,338
- WHERE YOU BEEN?

143
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,882
- ARE YOU WEARING MY 
DEAD WIFE'S MATERNITY CLOTHES?

144
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:02,092
- YEAH. IT'S THE ONLY THING 
I COULD FIND.

145
00:05:02,092 --> 00:05:03,678
WHERE ARE THE EGGS?

146
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,721
- DOCTOR SAYS THEY'RE BAD 
FOR THE BABY.

147
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:07,473
- SO, YOU READY FOR 
THIS NEW PROSECUTOR?

148
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,475
- I WAS UNTIL YOU CAME BACK.

149
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,185
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA 
TURN ME IN, ARE YOU?

150
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,603
BECAUSE I HAD NO IDEA

151
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,772
THERE WERE SANCTIONS 
AGAINST, UH, IRAQ.

152
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,231
YOU KNOW, 
TH-THEY SENT ME OVER THERE.

153
00:05:16,231 --> 00:05:17,900
THEY SAID, "GO BUILD."

154
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,194
UH-- UH, DO I LOOK LIKE 
A CRIMINAL MASTERMIND TO YOU?

155
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:21,696
HOW DO YOU GET THIS HAM OPEN?

156
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,072
I CAN'T-- I CAN'T GET 
THIS HAM OPEN.

157
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,365
- I'M NOT GONNA TURN YOU IN.

158
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,616
BUT YOU HAVE PUT ME 
IN A POSITION

159
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,159
WHERE I'M GONNA HAVE TO LIE.

160
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:28,953
WHY DID YOU COME BACK HERE 
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

161
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,580
- OH, NO REASON.

162
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,457
YOUR MOTHER HAPPENS TO BE 
SHTUPPING MY BROTHER,

163
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,249
THAT'S ALL.

164
00:05:34,249 --> 00:05:36,168
I'M ONLY HERE TO FIND OUT 
IF I HAVE A SHOT WITH HER.

165
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:37,628
IF SHE'S REALLY IN LOVE 
WITH OSCAR--

166
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,129
I DON'T KNOW-- 
TO HELL WITH HER.

167
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:40,548
I'LL JUST-- 
I'LL JUST LEAVE.

168
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,426
I'LL NEVER COME BACK.

169
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,470
- GREAT. SHE'S REALLY 
IN LOVE WITH HIM.

170
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,389
- THAT'S VERY FUNNY. 
I NEED YOU TO FIND OUT, OKAY?

171
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,516
'CAUSE EVER SINCE 
I-- I HEARD ABOUT THIS--

172
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,685
[breathes deeply] 
I CAN'T SLEEP.

173
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,104
I CAN'T-- I CAN'T EAT.

174
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:58,858
OH. LOOK, IT JUST PEELS OFF. 
ISN'T THAT CLEVER?

175
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,735
[narrator] 
LATER THAT DAY, GEORGE MICHAEL

176
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,737
WAS HAVING HIS EYE EXAM... 
AND FINDING IT TO BE

177
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,615
JUST AS DIFFICULT 
AS HIS MATH EXAM.

178
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,075
- ONE OR TWO? 
- TWO. NO. NO, ONE.

179
00:06:08,075 --> 00:06:12,997
- OKAY. TWO OR THREE? 
- THREE.

180
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:14,957
UH, UNLESS THREE IS 
TOO MUCH OF AN IMPROVEMENT.

181
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:17,292
I'M SORRY, IS ONE-- IS ONE 
IN THE MIX STILL?

182
00:06:17,292 --> 00:06:18,586
[narrator] 
AND MICHAEL MET

183
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,212
WITH THE NEW PROSECUTOR, 
WAYNE JARVIS.

184
00:06:20,212 --> 00:06:22,089
- I'M SORRY.

185
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:24,383
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS 
IS NOT A CONFLICT OF INTEREST.

186
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:26,719
YOU ALMOST REPRESENTED US, 
AND NOW YOU'RE THE PROSECUTOR.

187
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,178
- THE PATRIOT ACT. 
READ IT.

188
00:06:28,178 --> 00:06:29,764
- I-I'M NOT EVEN 
THE PRESIDENT ANYMORE.

189
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,348
MY BROTHER GOB IS.

190
00:06:31,348 --> 00:06:33,308
- I SPOKE WITH GOB. 
HE APPEARS TO KNOW NOTHING.

191
00:06:33,308 --> 00:06:35,603
- YEAH, THAT'S NOT AN ACT. 
HE TWICE TRIED TO MICROWAVE...

192
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,730
A DING DONG 
WHILE IT WAS STILL IN ITS FOIL.

193
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,524
TWICE. 
- TWICE?

194
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,566
- TWO TIMES.

195
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:41,651
[narrator] 
IN FACT,

196
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,360
GOB HAD BEEN GRILLED EARLIER.

197
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,195
- I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING 
ABOUT THE BUSINESS!

198
00:06:45,195 --> 00:06:46,739
- WE'RE GONNA GET YOU, BLUTH.

199
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,783
WE'LL GIVE YOU 
A FEW MINUTES TO THINK

200
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:49,909
ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.

201
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,955
HE KNOWS LESS THAN ANYONE 
WE HAVE EVER QUESTIONED.

202
00:06:54,955 --> 00:06:56,206
[narrator] 
GOB KNEW TOO LITTLE

203
00:06:56,206 --> 00:06:57,958
TO KNOW THAT, HOWEVER,

204
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:01,128
AND HIS CONFIDENCE 
HAD NEVER BEEN MORE SHAKEN.

205
00:07:01,128 --> 00:07:02,880
AND JUST WHEN HE THOUGHT 
HE COULDN'T HANDLE

206
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,507
ANOTHER EMBARRASSMENT--

207
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,551
- YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

208
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,928
THINGS COULD GET VERY MESSY 
FOR YOU, MICHAEL, UNLESS YOU

209
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,596
HAVE SOMETHING TO BARGAIN WITH,

210
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,682
LIKE, SAY, A FUGITIVE.

211
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,391
- I DON'T KNOW 
WHERE TO FIND SUCH A THING.

212
00:07:14,391 --> 00:07:15,893
- LOOK HARDER.

213
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,478
THERE MIGHT BE 
SOMETHING IN IT FOR YOU.

214
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,146
- SOMETHING TO GET 
ME OFF THE HOOK?

215
00:07:19,146 --> 00:07:21,816
- IF YOU COULD FIND 
A CERTAIN SOMEONE.

216
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:25,486
- CAN I HAVE A MOMENT ALONE 
WITH MY CLIENT, PLEASE?

217
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:29,073
DID YOU FOLLOW ANY OF THAT?

218
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:31,576
- YEAH. HE'S HINTING THAT 
HE'S GONNA GRANT ME IMMUNITY,

219
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,869
BUT ONLY ON THE CONDITION 
THAT I TURN IN MY FATHER.

220
00:07:33,869 --> 00:07:36,831
- YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR FATHER IS? 
NO, WAIT. DON'T TELL ME NOW.

221
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:40,417
OKAY. IF YOU KNOW, 
GIVE ME A HIGH FIVE.

222
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,963
MM-MMM.

223
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,469
[narrator] 
MICHAEL HAD JUST FOUND OUT...

224
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,971
HIS LEGAL PROBLEMS MIGHT GO AWAY 
IF HE TURNED IN HIS FATHER.

225
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,556
[beeps]

226
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,641
- IT'S JUST 
YOU AND ME NOW, HUH?

227
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:59,479
- NO, BARRY, I-- I KNOW 
WHERE MY FATHER IS, OKAY?

228
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,564
HE CAME BACK TO MAKE SURE 
THAT MY MOTHER WASN'T

229
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,483
REALLY IN LOVE WITH MY UNCLE.

230
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,359
HE WANTS TO KNOW IF 
HE'S STILL GOT A SHOT WITH HER.

231
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,569
IF HE DOESN'T, HE'S LEAVING.

232
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,153
- IF HE'S GOT A SHOT WITH HER,

233
00:08:08,153 --> 00:08:09,614
JUST GIVE ME A LITTLE TAP 
ON THE FANNY.

234
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,616
- THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN. 
- OKAY.

235
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,743
THEN LOOK, JUST TELL HIM 
ANYTHING HE WANTS TO HEAR

236
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,452
TO KEEP HIM FROM RUNNING.

237
00:08:15,452 --> 00:08:17,788
WE JUST HAVE TO KEEP HIM HERE 
UNTIL WE CAN HEAR...

238
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,540
WHAT KIND OF DEAL 
THEY'RE OFFERING YOU.

239
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,166
YOU JUST TRUST ME.

240
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,168
I'M A LOT MORE COMPETENT 
THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE.

241
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:28,090
OH, I FORGOT TO TAKE 
THE TINFOIL OFF TOO.

242
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,050
I REALLY WANTED THAT.

243
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,594
[narrator] 
BUSTER, MEANWHILE,

244
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,513
WAS SHARING HIS FAILURE... 
WITH SOMEONE WHO WAS

245
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,055
WELL-VERSED ON THE SUBJECT.

246
00:08:35,055 --> 00:08:36,724
- I MEAN, I COULDN'T 
GET OVER THE WALL.

247
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,475
THEY PUT ME 
ON SUSPENSION UNTIL I CAN.

248
00:08:38,475 --> 00:08:40,102
- PERHAPS YOU NEED 
TO FIND SOMEBODY

249
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,186
WHO CAN MOTIVATE YOU.

250
00:08:41,186 --> 00:08:42,479
- YEAH, BUT WHO?

251
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,898
[narrator] 
AND THEN IT HIT HIM.

252
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,525
- AH!

253
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,901
[narrator] 
GOB HAD ALWAYS PROVEN

254
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,068
A GOOD MOTIVATOR FOR BUSTER.

255
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:49,153
- DO IT! 
[blow lands]

256
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,155
- [groans]

257
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,323
- WHEN YOU DO THIS WITHOUT 
GETTING PUNCHED IN THE CHEST,

258
00:08:53,323 --> 00:08:54,366
YOU'LL HAVE MORE FUN.

259
00:08:54,366 --> 00:08:55,535
- [weakly] 
THANKS, BROTHER.

260
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,161
- HEY, BROTHER,

261
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,914
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO 
TO THE OLD PLAYGROUND WITH ME?

262
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,749
- I'M SURE AS HELL 
NOT GONNA GO BACK TO WORK.

263
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,417
I'M NEVER GOING BACK THERE.

264
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,502
- OH. WELL, THEN PERCHANCE 
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO BORROW

265
00:09:05,502 --> 00:09:07,880
YOUR CELLULAR TELEPHONE?

266
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,424
- I'M NOT FIT 
TO RUN A COMPANY.

267
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,426
AND I DON'T DESERVE 
A FANCY PHONE.

268
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,136
- WELL, THE BLUE MAN GROUP 
MIGHT NEED ME.

269
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,681
AND I DO DESERVE A FANCY PHONE.

270
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,183
[narrator] 
THEY DIDN'T, AND HE DOESN'T.

271
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,393
MICHAEL KNEW HE COULDN'T 
LET HIS FATHER GET AWAY.

272
00:09:21,393 --> 00:09:22,853
SO HE DECIDED TO SEE

273
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,689
IF HIS MOTHER AND OSCAR 
REALLY WERE IN LOVE.

274
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,607
- SO, COME ON.

275
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,734
AREN'T YOU REALLY JUST DATING 
OSCAR TO GET BACK AT DAD?

276
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,361
- OH, IT MAY HAVE 
STARTED AS THAT,

277
00:09:31,361 --> 00:09:35,365
BUT I HAVE 
FALLEN IN LOVE WITH OSCAR.

278
00:09:35,365 --> 00:09:36,951
AND IT'S SO NICE 
NOT TO HAVE TO WORRY

279
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,118
ABOUT GETTING PREGNANT.

280
00:09:38,118 --> 00:09:39,745
THE DOCTOR SAID

281
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,371
I COULDN'T BE A MOTHER NOW 
IF I TRIED.

282
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:43,498
- AND THAT WAS WITHOUT 
EVEN INTERVIEWING ME.

283
00:09:43,498 --> 00:09:45,585
- HERE YOU GO. 
HOT TEA.

284
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,838
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE-- 
A HOTTIE.

285
00:09:52,382 --> 00:09:54,009
- STOP ME FROM 
POURING THIS ON MYSELF.

286
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:55,886
I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE.

287
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,847
- ALL RIGHT. 
NOW, LISTEN, OSCAR.

288
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,140
MAYBE YOU SHOULD THINK 
ABOUT MOVING ON, YOU KNOW.

289
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,558
THIS REALLY ISN'T YOUR SCENE,

290
00:10:01,558 --> 00:10:04,103
WITH THE SWEATERS 
AND THE FURNITURE.

291
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,688
MAYBE YOU SHOULD 
TAKE A LEAP AT FREEDOM,

292
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,189
LIKE MY FATHER.

293
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,191
JUST RUN.

294
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:12,236
[air horn blasts] 
IS THAT HER RAPE HORN?

295
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:15,489
- IT'S MORE LIKE 
A STARTER'S PISTOL.

296
00:10:17,032 --> 00:10:19,201
- [whispers] 
RUN.

297
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,204
[narrator] 
MEANWHILE, TOBIAS

298
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,247
SET ABOUT LEARNING HOW TO

299
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,707
OPERATE HIS NEW CELL PHONE.

300
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,541
[Final Countdown melody] 
- OH!

301
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,168
[narrator] 
AND LINDSAY TRIED

302
00:10:28,168 --> 00:10:30,170
TO SPEND MORE TIME 
GETTING TO KNOW HER DAUGHTER.

303
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:31,255
- [hoarsely] 
HI, BABY.

304
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,882
OH, STEVE. HI.

305
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,133
- HI.

306
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,885
- WHAT ARE YOU 
DOING HERE?

307
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,970
- I THOUGHT I'D SPEND 
A LITTLE TIME WITH MY DAUGHTER.

308
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,764
AFTER ALL,

309
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,974
IT HASN'T BEEN THAT LONG 
SINCE I'VE BEEN IN HIGH SCHOOL.

310
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,225
[bell rings] 
IS THAT A FIRE?

311
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,351
- WE HAVE TO 
GO TO CLASS.

312
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,603
- OKAY. 
WELL, THIS WAS FUN.

313
00:10:46,603 --> 00:10:48,981
MAYBE LATER WE CAN ALL SPEND 
A LITTLE MORE TIME TOGETHER.

314
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,608
GO SHOPPING. 
GET A DRINK.

315
00:10:51,608 --> 00:10:53,903
- I'M IN SCHOOL. 
AND I'M 15.

316
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:57,907
- OH. WELL, 
I'M MUCH, MUCH, MUCH...

317
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,825
OLDER THAN 15.

318
00:11:01,201 --> 00:11:02,912
- YOU DON'T LOOK IT. 
- OH, STEVE.

319
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,831
HE THINKS I'M YOUNG. 
YOU MADE MY DAY AGAIN!

320
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,417
[laughing]

321
00:11:10,502 --> 00:11:11,962
- YOUR MOM'S PRETTY, UH, 
OUT THERE.

322
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,756
- SHE'S NOT MY MOM.

323
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,841
- BUT SHE SAID 
YOU WERE HER DAUGHTER.

324
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,260
- HIS DAUGHTER. 
THAT'S MY DAD.

325
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,055
- THAT'S A DUDE? 
- AND THE WORST PART IS,

326
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,973
HE THINKS HE'S PASSING.

327
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,436
[narrator] 
RIGHT OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL,

328
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,438
BUSTER TRIED TO PUT 
HIS OWN PLAN...INTO ACTION

329
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,773
BY STIRRING UP OLD MEMORIES.

330
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,316
- WHAT DO YOU SAY?

331
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,526
I NEED YOUR HELP 
TO GET OVER THE WALL. PUSH ME.

332
00:11:34,526 --> 00:11:36,528
- I'M THE PATHETIC ONE, BUSTER, 
NOT YOU.

333
00:11:36,528 --> 00:11:39,198
I TOTALLY FREAKED OUT IN FRONT 
OF THAT PROSECUTOR TODAY.

334
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:42,159
LIKE A LITTLE GIRL 
IN A LITTLE DRESS--

335
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,245
LITTLE SADDLE SHOES, 
LITTLE PIGTAILS.

336
00:11:45,245 --> 00:11:47,539
- WOW, THAT DOES SOUND 
LIKE A LITTLE GIRL.

337
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:49,792
COME ON, GET MY IRE UP.

338
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,794
PUSH ME! 
[chuckles]

339
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,754
OH.

340
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:56,924
OH, THIS IS TURNING OUT

341
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,300
TO BE MUCH MORE FUN 
THAN I'D HOPED.

342
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,844
[narrator] 
IT WAS FUN.

343
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,636
BUT IT WASN'T 
MAKING HIM A BETTER SOLDIER.

344
00:12:01,636 --> 00:12:03,430
- PUSH ME HIGHER. 
[chuckles]

345
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,474
OOH! 
I'LL DO IT.

346
00:12:06,641 --> 00:12:07,893
WHOO!

347
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,478
[narrator] 
AND MICHAEL REPORTED

348
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:10,771
TO HIS FATHER ABOUT

349
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,564
HIS MEETING WITH THE PROSECUTOR.

350
00:12:12,564 --> 00:12:14,608
- PROSECUTOR OFFER YOU A DEAL? 
- THAT WAS NOT SAID.

351
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:17,027
BUT, UH, MORE IMPORTANTLY, 
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT IT SEEMS

352
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:19,279
LIKE OSCAR'S ON HIS WAY OUT.

353
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,281
- REALLY?

354
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:23,575
- YEAH. SO JUST SIT TIGHT, 
AND EVERYTHING SHOULD BE FINE.

355
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,955
- WOW. HEY, BY THE WAY, 
I BROKE THIS THING. I--

356
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:30,916
WHAT THE HELL IS IT ANYWAY? 
- THAT'S A BREAST PUMP, DAD.

357
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,211
- OH. WELL, I DID NOT 
USE IT FOR THAT.

358
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,670
[narrator] 
AND SO MICHAEL WENT

359
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,589
TO MEET THE PROSECUTOR.

360
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:39,758
- I FELT OBLIGATED TO SHARE 
SOME PHOTOGRAPHS WITH YOU.

361
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:42,052
I OBTAINED THESE FROM 
THE BLUTH COMPANY E-MAIL SERVER.

362
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,554
- YOU TAPPED INTO OUR E-MAIL? 
THAT'S LEGAL?

363
00:12:44,554 --> 00:12:46,598
- I'M GOING FOR A HOT DING DONG.

364
00:12:46,598 --> 00:12:49,601
HOT DING DONG? 
YEAH?

365
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:51,770
- MICHAEL, THIS IS 
A CLOSE-UP SATELLITE PHOTOGRAPH

366
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,397
OF THE IRAQI COUNTRYSIDE.

367
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,941
SEE THIS LITTLE SERIES OF HILLS 
AROUND THAT STREAM?

368
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,110
THOSE ARE BUNKERS. 
WE BELIEVE THAT THOSE BUNKERS...

369
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,320
CONTAIN WEAPONS 
OF MASS DESTRUCTION.

370
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,738
WE ALSO THINK THAT YOUR FATHER

371
00:13:01,738 --> 00:13:04,283
WAS BUILDING ON THAT LAND 
TO HIDE THEM.

372
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:07,077
WHICH IS WHY THAT PHOTOGRAPH 
WAS ON HIS E-MAIL.

373
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:09,830
- ARE YOU SERIOUS? 
- ALMOST ALWAYS.

374
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,957
I WAS ONCE CALLED 
THE WORST AUDIENCE PARTICIPANT

375
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,000
CIRQUE DU SOLEIL EVER HAD.

376
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,543
- THIS IS A BIG ACCUSATION.

377
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,795
- I DID NOT FIND 
THEIR BUFFOONERY AMUSING.

378
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:18,797
- ABOUT MY FATHER.

379
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:21,466
- HE'S GUILTY, MICHAEL, 
OF MEDIUM TO HEAVY TREASON.

380
00:13:21,466 --> 00:13:23,635
THAT PROVES IT. 
YOU CAN'T PROTECT HIM.

381
00:13:23,635 --> 00:13:26,555
TURN HIM IN 
AND IMMUNITY IS YOURS.

382
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,392
[narrator] 
MICHAEL RETURNED HOME

383
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,810
TO CONFRONT HIS FATHER. 
- MICHAEL?

384
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,478
MOM WAS JUST HERE 
LOOKING FOR YOU.

385
00:13:33,478 --> 00:13:35,272
SHE'S CLAIMING OSCAR'S 
DISAPPEARED BECAUSE

386
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,565
OF SOMETHING YOU SAID.

387
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:37,858
- CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW. 
- REALLY?

388
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,443
WHAT'S WRONG 
WITH YOUR VOICE?

389
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,028
- I CAN TALK, SURE.

390
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,696
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING 
TO OSCAR.

391
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,364
ANYTHING ELSE? 
- NO.

392
00:13:44,364 --> 00:13:45,866
OH. HEY, DID I TELL YOU?

393
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,701
I ACCIDENTALLY 
RAN INTO STEVE HOLT.

394
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:50,412
- WOW. EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU 
IS SO WOMANLY.

395
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,664
YOU'RE EVERYTHING 
A WOMAN SHOULD BE.

396
00:13:52,664 --> 00:13:55,375
- [hoarsely] 
THANK YOU, STEVE.

397
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,086
WE ENDED UP 
MAKING A LUNCH DATE.

398
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,129
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE 
SPENDING TIME WITH MAEBY.

399
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,256
- YEAH. I'LL HAVE TO 
RESCHEDULE HER.

400
00:14:01,256 --> 00:14:03,258
BUT MOM ISN'T THE ONLY ONE 
"FINDING LOVE" WHERE SHE

401
00:14:03,258 --> 00:14:04,301
LEAST EXPECTS IT.

402
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,427
HER WORDS.

403
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,636
- WH-WHOA! 
FINDING LOVE--

404
00:14:06,636 --> 00:14:09,348
SHE SAID THAT? 
WHERE, HERE?

405
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,350
- YEAH, SHE WON'T 
SHUT UP ABOUT HIM.

406
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,851
SHE SAID "TINGLING," 
LIKE, 75 TIMES.

407
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,478
- GETS ME TINGLING.

408
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:18,023
AND, YOU KNOW, WITH OSCAR 
THERE'S TINGLING.

409
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,524
- SHE SAID THOSE WORDS 
IN THIS HOUSE?

410
00:14:19,524 --> 00:14:22,611
- YEAH.

411
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,404
- DAD?

412
00:14:24,404 --> 00:14:26,365
HELLO?

413
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,246
[narrator] 
MICHAEL HAD JUST

414
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,372
DISCOVERED THAT HIS FATHER

415
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,539
HAD ESCAPED FROM THE ATTIC.

416
00:14:34,539 --> 00:14:36,166
- HELLO?

417
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,960
- THIS IS GONNA SOUND 
LIKE A STRANGE QUESTION,

418
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,503
BUT HAVE YOU SEEN DAD?

419
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,213
- OF COURSE NOT. 
AND I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU.

420
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,715
YOU TRIED TO SCARE AWAY OSCAR, 
WHICH DIDN'T WORK.

421
00:14:43,715 --> 00:14:46,718
HE'S BACK. 
- I JUST, UH--

422
00:14:46,718 --> 00:14:48,262
I JUST WANTED 
TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU.

423
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,055
THAT'S-- 
THAT'S ALL I'M GOOD FOR.

424
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,724
- DID YOU HEAR THAT? 
HE SAID HE JUST WANTS TO--

425
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:55,310
- GOOD-BYE, MOM. 
- HAVE SEX WITH ME.

426
00:14:58,438 --> 00:14:59,731
YOU SMELL 
LIKE A PINECONE.

427
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:01,400
- YEAH, THAT'S THE WEED.

428
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,735
I WENT TO MY, UH, 
MY-- [bleep] HOLE TRAILER,

429
00:15:03,735 --> 00:15:06,071
AND I-- I SMOKED SOME 
LIKE A CIGARETTE.

430
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:09,783
- SHOULD WE TAKE IT 
INTO THE BEDROOM?

431
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:13,037
- ONLY IF YOU REALLY LOVE ME. 
- OF COURSE I DO.

432
00:15:15,747 --> 00:15:18,208
- [inhales] 
OHH.

433
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,252
[muttering]

434
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,754
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? 
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

435
00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:24,924
- I'M ON MUSHROOMS!

436
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,009
I'M ON BAD MUSHROOMS!

437
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,677
[narrator] 
AND SOON, THE PROSECUTOR'S

438
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,637
EVIDENCE BECAME PUBLIC.

439
00:15:30,637 --> 00:15:33,098
- WE'VE OBTAINED PHOTOGRAPHS 
THAT OFFICIALS CALL

440
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,684
DEFINITE PROOF 
OF W.M.D.'s IN IRAQ.

441
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,769
WHAT THAT MEANS 
FOR YOUR WEEKEND AT 10:00.

442
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:39,563
[narrator] 
IT SEEMS THAT DUE

443
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,773
TO THE NEW INFORMATION-SHARING 
PROVISIONS...

444
00:15:41,773 --> 00:15:44,401
IN THE PATRIOT ACT, THE PHOTOS 
HAD MADE THE ROUNDS...

445
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:47,529
THROUGH SEVERAL BRANCHES 
OF GOVERNMENT...

446
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,781
AND ULTIMATELY 
TO THE U.S. ARMY ITSELF.

447
00:15:49,781 --> 00:15:52,034
- I JUST CAME BACK TO TELL YOU. 
I CAN'T DO THAT WALL.

448
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,328
- THERE'S NO TIME FOR THAT. 
WE'RE SHIPPING OUT WITHOUT YOU.

449
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,538
- WHAT? 
- DIDN'T YOU SEE?

450
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,290
- PICK IT UP. PICK IT UP.

451
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,293
- WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION?

452
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,587
- THOSE BASTARDS. 
- I DID NOT SAY THAT.

453
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:04,964
- ARE YOU GONNA LET THAT SLIDE?

454
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,591
ARE YOU GONNA 
ALLOW YOUR CHILDREN,

455
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:09,676
AND YOUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN,

456
00:16:09,676 --> 00:16:11,886
AND ANY CHILDREN 
THAT I MIGHT HAVE OUT THERE...

457
00:16:11,886 --> 00:16:14,639
TO LIVE IN FEAR 
FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES?

458
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,559
CLIMB THAT WALL, HOMO!

459
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,311
- CLIMB IT.

460
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,937
[narrator] 
AND JUST AS THE MEN THOUGHT

461
00:16:20,937 --> 00:16:22,564
THE DAY COULD 
GET NO MORE SURPRISING,

462
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,608
[yelling] 
IT DID.

463
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,068
- OHH! OOH! 
[thuds]

464
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,652
[whimpering]

465
00:16:27,652 --> 00:16:29,488
- WHEN YOU DO THIS 
WITHOUT GETTING PUNCHED,

466
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,990
YOU'LL HAVE MORE FUN.

467
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,325
- OH, HEY, GEORGE MICHAEL. 
- OH, HI.

468
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,410
- THEY FOUND W.M.D.'s IN IRAQ, 
SO WE GOT A HALF DAY.

469
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:38,497
- COOL. SO I GOT 
A "C" ON MY MATH TEST.

470
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,832
NOT ANTICIPATING 
A GOOD REACTION ON THAT.

471
00:16:40,832 --> 00:16:42,251
- WELL, THE "B" GOT YOU GLASSES.

472
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,461
MAYBE THIS TIME 
YOU'LL GET A NECK BRACE.

473
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:47,839
ANYWAYS, HAVE YOU SEEN MY MOM?

474
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,299
- SEEMS POSSIBLE.

475
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,717
- SHE'S ON HER WAY 
TO MEET STEVE HOLT.

476
00:16:50,717 --> 00:16:52,636
- I THOUGHT YOU LIKED HIM.

477
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,763
- I DO. I'M CRAZY ABOUT HIM. 
BUT HE'S OBSESSED WITH HER.

478
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,681
THAT'S ALL HE WANTS 
TO TALK ABOUT.

479
00:16:56,681 --> 00:16:58,100
[narrator] 
LINDSAY FELT BAD.

480
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,768
PERHAPS SHE HAD 
HURT HER DAUGHTER...

481
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,020
BY PUTTING HERSELF FIRST.

482
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,729
BUT SHE WOULD HAVE FELT WORSE

483
00:17:02,729 --> 00:17:04,564
IF SHE'D REMAINED 
EVEN A MOMENT LONGER.

484
00:17:04,564 --> 00:17:06,816
- BUT IT'S ONLY BECAUSE 
HE THINKS SHE'S GOT A PENIS.

485
00:17:06,816 --> 00:17:08,443
OH, I TOLD HIM 
SHE WAS A TRANNY.

486
00:17:08,443 --> 00:17:09,861
[narrator] 
MEANWHILE, MICHAEL WAS

487
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:11,488
STILL UP IN THE ATTIC.

488
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,407
- DAD, WHAT'S GOIN' ON? 
SOMEBODY COULD SEE YOU.

489
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,075
- WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE, MIKE?

490
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,993
YOU'RE TURNING ME IN, 
AREN'T YOU?

491
00:17:16,993 --> 00:17:19,163
- THEY SAY YOU'RE INVOLVED 
IN SOMETHING REAL BIG, DAD.

492
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,747
THEY'VE GOT PHOTOS.

493
00:17:20,747 --> 00:17:23,042
- NOT TRUE. BUT GO. 
KNOCK YOURSELF OUT. TURN ME IN.

494
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,710
I WENT AND I SAW FOR MYSELF.

495
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,671
SHE'S IN LOVE WITH HIM.

496
00:17:29,756 --> 00:17:31,466
- THEN WHY DID YOU COME BACK?

497
00:17:31,466 --> 00:17:33,427
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST 
LEAVE FOREVER LIKE YOU SAID?

498
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,969
- AND GO WHERE?

499
00:17:34,969 --> 00:17:36,346
[sighs]

500
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,432
MAKE A DEAL 
FOR YOURSELF, MIKE.

501
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,559
I GOT NO LOVE 
IN MY LIFE ANYMORE.

502
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,893
[narrator] 
AND MICHAEL REALIZED

503
00:17:41,893 --> 00:17:43,812
FOR THE FIRST TIME...

504
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:46,148
THAT HIS FATHER WAS CAPABLE 
OF HAVING HIS HEART BROKEN.

505
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,607
LATER THAT DAY,

506
00:17:47,607 --> 00:17:49,526
MICHAEL HAD HIS MEETING 
WITH THE PROSECUTOR.

507
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:50,944
- SO, WHERE THE HELL IS HE?

508
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,362
COME ON, BLUTH. 
WHAT'S IT GONNA BE?

509
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,989
YOUR FATHER OR YOUR FREEDOM?

510
00:17:54,989 --> 00:17:56,325
[narrator] 
AND MICHAEL HAD TO DO

511
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,992
THE RIGHT THING.

512
00:17:57,992 --> 00:18:00,079
- I DON'T KNOW 
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.

513
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,333
- MICHAEL, WHEN WE STARTED 
TALKING TO YOU,

514
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,667
WE DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING.

515
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,545
BUT NOW... WE GOT SOMETHING.

516
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,046
AND YOU'RE GONNA 
DO TIME FOR IT.

517
00:18:10,046 --> 00:18:11,506
- THOSE ARE THE PICTURES?

518
00:18:11,506 --> 00:18:14,050
- THEY'RE ALL OVER THE NEWS.

519
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:16,428
- THOSE ARE BALLS. 
- WHAT?

520
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,887
[narrator] 
BARRY WAS RIGHT.

521
00:18:17,887 --> 00:18:19,973
TOBIAS HAD INADVERTENTLY 
PHOTOGRAPHED HIMSELF...

522
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,933
WHILE LEARNING TO USE 
HIS CAMERA PHONE.

523
00:18:21,933 --> 00:18:25,270
- SEE, UH, THIS CLOSE, 
THEY ALWAYS LOOK LIKE LANDSCAPE.

524
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,565
NOPE, YOU'RE LOOKIN' AT BALLS.

525
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,150
[narrator] 
SOON, FORENSIC SCIENTISTS

526
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,568
CONFIRMED THIS.

527
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,403
AND FOR THE SECOND TIME 
IN TWO DAYS,

528
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,447
THE INFORMATION-SHARING NETWORK 
PUT INTO PLACE

529
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,865
BY THE PATRIOT ACT...

530
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,908
WAS PUT TO USE.

531
00:18:38,908 --> 00:18:41,786
- THEY'RE BALLS?

532
00:18:41,786 --> 00:18:43,788
- WE'RE LOOKING AT BALLS. 
LET'S TURN IT AROUND.

533
00:18:43,788 --> 00:18:45,332
- COPY ON BALLS. 
WE'RE TURNING.

534
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:46,958
[narrator] 
AND EVENTUALLY, THE NEWS

535
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,793
TRAVELED BACK TO THE SOURCE.

536
00:18:48,793 --> 00:18:51,921
- WE GOT ONE WRONG, 
AND WE DO APOLOGIZE.

537
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,926
- I'M ON TV.

538
00:18:56,926 --> 00:18:58,553
[narrator] 
AND MICHAEL RETURNED HOME

539
00:18:58,553 --> 00:18:59,596
A FREE MAN.

540
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,265
- YOU GOT THE GLASSES.

541
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,974
NOW YOU'LL DO BETTER 
ON THOSE MATH EXAMS.

542
00:19:02,974 --> 00:19:04,518
- I THINK I BLEW 
THE EYE EXAM TOO.

543
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,645
EVERY TIME I TAKE THESE OFF, 
I FEEL BETTER.

544
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,398
- LET ME SEE 'EM.

545
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,982
- I'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE.

546
00:19:10,982 --> 00:19:13,026
[narrator] 
FOR A WHILE, GEORGE MICHAEL...

547
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,362
HAD SHARED A ROOM 
WITH HIS UNCLE TOBIAS.

548
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,030
- OH, TH-THERE'S A LADDER.

549
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:20,492
- [groaning] 
I DON'T NEED IT.

550
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:24,204
- YEAH, I DON'T THINK 
YOU NEED GLASSES, SON.

551
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:27,499
- WELL, IF THE COPS ARE WAITING, 
I'M READY TO GO.

552
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,543
I GOT NOTHIN' 
SINCE YOUR MOTHER DESERTED ME.

553
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,336
- YOU KNOW, 
YOU-- YOU DESERTED HER, DAD.

554
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,547
YOU KNOW, YOU ESCAPED, 
AND THEN YOU FAKED YOUR DEATH.

555
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:36,007
I'M NOT SO SURE SHE SEES YOU 
AS THAT RELIABLE.

556
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:38,385
BUT, LISTEN, 
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

557
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,345
I DID NOT TURN YOU IN.

558
00:19:42,138 --> 00:19:44,308
- YOU DIDN'T? 
- NO.

559
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,850
AND I DON'T KNOW 
WHETHER IT'S JUST

560
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,602
TRACY'S MATERNITY CLOTHES,

561
00:19:47,602 --> 00:19:50,189
BUT IT'S VERY NICE TO SEE 
A SOFTER SIDE OF YOU.

562
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,773
ALTHOUGH I'M SORRY

563
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:54,150
THAT YOU FEEL YOU HAVE 
NO LOVE IN YOUR LIFE.

564
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,528
- WELL, I DON'T-- 
I DON'T FEEL THAT WAY ANYMORE.

565
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:01,115
THANKS.

566
00:20:01,115 --> 00:20:03,910
BEEN A LONG TIME 
SINCE SOMEONE STOOD UP FOR ME.

567
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:08,623
- FOUND HER PERFUME, HUH?

568
00:20:08,623 --> 00:20:09,958
- JUST A LITTLE 
LEFT IN THE BOTTLE.

569
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,125
- WELL, THAT WAS 
THE END OF IT.

570
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,502
- YEAH.

571
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,338

OSCAR RETURNS TO FIND 
A NOW-DISTANT LUCILLE.

575
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:23,597
- I'M BACK. 
BUT JUST FOR NOW.

576
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,724
'CAUSE YOU GET 
ON MY CASE-- SHOO--

577
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,352

578
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,354
[narrator] 
WHICH WAS WHAT

579
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,105
ATTRACTED HIM TO HER... 
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,398

I WAS HOPING WE COULD 
GO TO DINNER TONIGHT.

587
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,200
- OH, I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA 
GO SEE STEVE HOLT AT SCHOOL.

588
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,202
- NO, I JUST WANTED 
TO CHECK HIM OUT...

589
00:20:46,202 --> 00:20:49,038
AND MAKE SURE HE'S 
GOOD ENOUGH FOR MY DAUGHTER.

590
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:51,500
IS IT-- 
- IT'S A "SHEH-MA-LEE."

591
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,543

RETURNS TO 
AN UNFORTUNATE QUIRK.

596
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,844

MY CUTOFFS.

597
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,768

CUTOFFS UP HERE?
