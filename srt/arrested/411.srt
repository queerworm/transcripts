00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:14,682
NARRATOR:<i> Gob Bluth had just</i>
<i>been told by his father</i>

2
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:17,100
<i>to go to work</i>
<i>for his younger brother.</i>

3
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:18,894
And then thanks
for the birthday card

4
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:22,021
that I never got from you
for the last 40 years.

5
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:23,858
NARRATOR:
<i>In fact,</i>

6
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:25,901
<i>-it was a brother with whom</i>
<i>Gob...</i> -What the hell?

7
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:27,110
-(horns honking)
<i>-...was secretly competitive.</i>

8
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,403
MICHAEL:
I got the right of way.

9
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,823
-GOB: N-No.
-MICHAEL: Okay. (laughs)

10
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:34,451
NARRATOR:<i> And perhaps it was</i>
<i>that sense of competition...</i>

11
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:37,078
(tires screeching, horn honking)

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,206
<i>...that led</i>
<i>to this tinkling match.</i>

13
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:41,041
GOB:
<i>I've met someone.</i>

14
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:43,752
Can't really give you any
information-- kind of famousy.

15
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:45,420
-I also met someone.
-Have you?

16
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,631
Also famousy.
Can't give<i> you</i> any information.

17
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:50,133
-Is it Julie Bowen?
-No, it's not.

18
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,802
-Is yours Julie Bowen?
-Is yours Julie...?

19
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:54,555
Oh, my God, Michael,
you're seeing Julie Bowen?

20
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:55,806
I am not seeing Julie Bowen,

21
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:58,017
but if you are,
you tell me right now.

22
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,769
I want to hear you say the words
"I'm not seeing Julie Bowen."

23
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:02,938
I have not seen Julie Bowen.

24
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,398
Well, that's a funny way
to phrase it.

25
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,233
NARRATOR:
<i>This went on for some time,</i>

26
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,944
<i>but eventually</i>
<i>they started talking business.</i>

27
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:10,988
If it wasn't for the movie
thing, I would do it myself.

28
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,197
They practically sell
themselves; you just got

29
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,866
-to bring the people in.
-(squawk)

30
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:16,243
-Lindsay.<i> -But soon the hard</i>
<i>lemonade softened</i>

31
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,995
<i>-their competitive edge.</i> 
-No, no, this-- maybe Tobias.

32
00:01:18,037 --> 00:01:19,538
<i>And Michael confessed</i>

33
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,584
<i>that he had grown estranged</i>
<i>from his son.</i>

34
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,919
I'll call him for you.

35
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,004
You've given me
a new sense of purpose.

36
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:28,839
I don't want you
to get your hopes up.

37
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:31,466
You know, when I said that, that
these places sell themselves,

38
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:35,303
I should have gone on to say,
you know, that, that, uh...

39
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,889
No, they don't.

40
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:39,224
No, I'm not talking
about selling these mausoleums.

41
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,476
I mean destroying Tony Wonder.

42
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,854
I'm gonna destroy his career the
same way that he destroyed mine.

43
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:46,314
NARRATOR:<i> Gob was referring</i>
<i>to an escape act</i>

44
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,191
<i>he'd performed that had failed</i>

45
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,944
<i>when the hidden compartment</i>
<i>that held</i>

46
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:52,446
<i>the keys to his escape</i>
<i>hadn't opened...</i>

47
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,614
-It's not going to work.
<i>-...humiliating him</i>

48
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,032
<i>in front of his bride...</i>

49
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:57,367
<i>-uh, her...</i> 
-He's not coming back.

50
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,453
<i>...and all of Christendom.</i>

51
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,956
Destroying Tony Wonder is
your sense of purpose?

52
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:03,498
I thought you said,
thanks to me...

53
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,792
Because he's performing
at a gay club tonight,

54
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,209
and I need you to act as
my boyfriend

55
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,252
to help me get in.

56
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,088
I'm gonna say no, thank you.

57
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,756
And don't you think
it's a little inappropriate?

58
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:12,215
I am your brother.

59
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,009
You sound like my son.

60
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:17,096
NARRATOR:<i> Whom Gob had spoken to</i>
<i>earlier that day.</i>

61
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,473
<i>-And in a van, by the way.</i> 
-Hey, you remembered.

62
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:23,811
(chuckles) How about you and I
go to a magic show together?

63
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,062
(laughing):
I love magic, of course.

64
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:27,064
I mean, my dad's a magician.

65
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:30,818
-Well, you're my dad, I mean,
so, so you should know. -Right.

66
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:34,571
Well, it'd be sort of a, a
father-son thing at a gay club.

67
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,406
Well, technically gay night
at a magic club.

68
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:37,950
Hey, you know what'd be funny?

69
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:39,701
If you pretended
to be my boyfriend

70
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:40,869
so I could lock
this guy Tony Wonder...

71
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,704
You know, I-I don't know,

72
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:45,332
I-I don't think this whole thing
is sounding like a good idea.

73
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,668
Besides, last time we tried
to do something together,

74
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,252
-you didn't even show up.
-You know what?

75
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,588
You're mad at me--
I get it, I totally get it,

76
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,424
-and guess what--
I'm mad at you. -You know, Dad,

77
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,927
that attitude might be
why you're alone all the time.

78
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:59,013
-The way you treat people...
-What about you?

79
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:01,640
I didn't hear from you
for your entire childhood,

80
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,391
and then thanks
for the birthday card

81
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:07,729
that I never got from you
for the last 40 years.

82
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,314
NARRATOR:
<i>This was extra hard for Steve</i>

83
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,483
<i>to hear on his actual birthday.</i>

84
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:12,818
And didn't you already try
locking Tony Wonder in

85
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,611
-his trick?
-Oh, yeah, but that

86
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:16,530
wasn't for revenge,
that was just on spec.

87
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,491
-Just like Tony Wonder.
<i>-And it didn't work. Besides,</i>

88
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,576
that's before I knew that
he had locked me in my trick.

89
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,871
You still don't know that he
tried to lock you in your trick.

90
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,789
Hey, I do know, I have proof.

91
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:30,502
I went in that cave
and I found this.

92
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,087
We both know
what that stands for.

93
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:33,130
Jesus.

94
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:34,255
No, that would be a "J."

95
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,674
This is a "T."

96
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,759
Tony Wonder was there
in the cave the night

97
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,012
that I did my big illusion,
so when I went yesterday

98
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:42,014
to the cave and I saw
that this had wedged

99
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:44,933
my compartment door shut,
I knew that I'd been wronged.

100
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:46,226
Okay, the only thing
that we know

101
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,854
is that you tried to
lock Tony Wonder

102
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:49,813
in his trick first.

103
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:51,106
-Right?
-No,

104
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:52,399
-no.
-So you're even.

105
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,026
Because mine didn't work.

106
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:55,986
He got the last laugh,
which, in this case, happened

107
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:57,445
to be the first laugh.
I don't understand

108
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,822
why you can't seem to follow me

109
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,615
-on any of this.
-Gob, you've got a chance

110
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,118
to build a brand-new life.
Don't run away from it again.

111
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,162
-Don't try to escape it.
-I don't do that, Michael.

112
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:06,997
Listen, if you insist
on speaking to me like you're

113
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,332
my wife, then don't be surprised
to find my (bleep) in you

114
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,376
and then you never hear
from me again.

115
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,628
(sighs)
I'm offering you a good job

116
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,840
selling good homes,
making real good money,

117
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:21,469
and I'm not asking
for anything in return.

118
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,346
What is this?

119
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,639
I'm asking for a little
something in return.

120
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,016
These-- this is for the movie.

121
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:27,768
This is for your life rights
in perpetuity,

122
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,770
in the known universe
and beyond.

123
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,563
Blah, blah, blah, look at this.

124
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,440
What's that mean--
you're not gonna sign it?

125
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,983
No, I was just thinking

126
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,527
that I should have my attorney
Bob Loblaw look at this.

127
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,529
Oh, he doesn't need to-- it's
all pretty boilerplate stuff.

128
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:40,614
Yeah, no, I'm fine with it.

129
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,407
I'm gonna be in a movie.

130
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,575
-(laughs)
-No, you're not.

131
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,994
I'm gonna be in a movie. Okay.

132
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,704
NARRATOR:
<i>Now the story of a family</i>

133
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:51,374
<i>whose future</i>

139
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,517
I need to see you tonight.

140

<i>-...to talk to his son.</i> 
-It's about your father and you.

141
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,731
Really, is... is he upset?

142
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,817
(over phone):
Do I seem like a clown to you?

143
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,193
I got it.

144
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:19,903
Do I seem like some kind
of a clown to you?

145
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:21,905
Look, I got it, I got it,
Uncle Gob, just tell me where.

146
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,741
Meet me tonight
at the Gothic Castle.

147
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,160
I will-- the Gothic Castle?

148
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,744
No, the Gothicassle.
Yes, the Gothic Castle.

149
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,412
No, I didn't say
the Gothicassle.

150
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,290
What, what do you think,
they call it the Gothicassle?

151
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,624
No, I said the Gothic Castle.

152
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,251
-It's the Gothic Castle.
-Gothic Castle.

153
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:35,460
Okay.

154
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:38,088
TAILOR:
I think you look amazing.

155
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,631
I'll take it.

156
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:40,966
-Great.
-No, no.

157
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,927
The compliment, not the shirt.

158
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:46,221
NARRATOR:<i> And so it was</i>
<i>a very worried George Michael</i>

159

<i>his uncle at the Gothic Castle,</i>

160
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,643

<i>the Gothicassle.</i>

162
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:55,147
-Uncle Gob.
-Don't call me Unc...

163
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:56,648
Actually, no, that's good,
that works here.

164
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,357
Is my dad upset?
What's going on?

165
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,152
-No, he's fine. -But you told me
he was really upset

-about something.
-I don't know.

167
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,363
I do know that your daddy
wants you to get

168
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:05,740
your hot, little, tight,
little, hot ass

169
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,575
right up there right away
to see him.

170
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,452
-BOUNCER: You're good. -You,
you had me come all the way here

171
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,121
just to tell me
my dad wants me to meet him?

172
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:12,956
No, no, those two things
are unrelated.

173
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,042
No, I'm, I'm here 'cause
I'm trying to lock this guy Tony

174
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,543
into this gay magic trick,

175
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,962
and I just needed
a believable arm candy bean.

176
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:21,006
And don't make that face;
you look homophobic.

177
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,799
-No, I'm not being homophobic.
-Why are you doing this?

178
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,551
-I'm, I'm uncomfortable.
-This is very important for me.

179
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,427
Don't worry, you're blending in
here perfectly.

180
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,386
A newbie.

181
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,430
(chuckles)
Except,

182
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,891
even if he does post that
somewhere,

183
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,226
the Fakeblock thing
will scrub it away.

184
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,019
You know about Fakeblock?

185
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,979
You know, that's my software.

186
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,065
I wonder if my dad thinks
I'm blowing him off

187
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,108
because that's starting
to take off now.

188
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,277
Well, you should go find out
'cause I do know that your dad

189
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,321
is really, really,
really upset with you.

190
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:46,156
He is upset?
I asked you that.

191
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:48,449
That was literally
the first thing I asked you.

192
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,327
You're giving me these craz...

193
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:51,870
-Mad?
-N...

194
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,747
-God, what is that inky taste?
-It's my stamp.

195
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,374
-Oh, I'm so sorry about that.
-No, that-that's okay.

196
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:57,625
I probably won't come back in.

197
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,627
I-I'm gonna go see my dad.

198
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,380
Yeah, you are
'cause you're a good son.

199
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,007
Ow!

200
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,967
-Bit my tongue, that little
bitch.<i> -Oh, no, he didn't.</i>

201
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,303
-They're always doing that.
<i>-I mean, oh, no, he didn't.</i>

202
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,597
Thank you, George Michael;
honestly I owe you big-time.

203
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,724
Not a lot of nephews
would do this for their uncles.

204
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:13,975
Now get out of here.

205
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,186
I never want to sleep
with you again.

206
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:17,854
I mean, I probably will.
(whispers): I don't.

207
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,314
But are we good?

208
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:20,982
-We're good.

Just go to work.

Didn't expect to see you here.
Want to get a drink later?

242
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,626
<i>And believe it or not,</i>

243
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,295
Now everybody's gay!

246
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,635
<i>They started out gay.</i>

247
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,554
You missed your cue!

<i>Vamanos!</i>

255
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,281
Oh, hey, come on, man.

256
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:34,615
Timing, right?

257
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:35,742
Hey, leave the mask.

258
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:36,993
Yeah, of course-- mask.

259
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,328
Yeah, that makes sense.

260
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,996
I use a mask myself, in my act.

261
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:42,665
But you have to tell me how
you do that bean bag trick.

262
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,709
Well, I guess,
since you're a magician, too.

263
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:45,835
But not a word of this.

264
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:48,046
(whispering):
I did use a mask.

265
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,256
I put it on another guy,

266
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,673
and then I was
in the bean bag chair

267
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,758
the whole time.

268
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,343
Oh, well, that's... that's...

269
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:55,053
(whispering): ...that's why
they put that sign

270
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,097
on the bean bag chair that says,
"Do not steal this..."

271
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,973
<i>And the magicians</i>
<i>shared the secrets</i>

272

275
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,106
So how have you been?

276
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,858
I haven't seen you
since your "wedding,"

277
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,360
when you did the Jesus gag.

278
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:12,320
See, it's like a quotation mark,
but with a "W."

279
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:13,821
Oh, yeah, right, I got ya.

280
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,532
That's... I should do that.

281
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:16,657
Hey, don't. Okay?

282
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,993
I-I... I won't.

283
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,455
Yeah, uh, no, the marriage
was unsuccessful.

284
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:24,499
I guess you could say
I was a runaway groom.

285
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,334
Well, makes sense now,
doesn't it?

286
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:27,544
What do you mean?

287
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:28,628
Well, I mean,
you are gay, right?

288
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,505
Oh, yes, right, yeah.

289
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,924
Very... because of
what I'm... dressed...

290
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,384
And my boyfriend
was here earlier.

291
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:35,843
And-and he bit my tongue.

292
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,637
<i>And that's when Gob did</i>

293
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:38,972
<i>a magic trick of his own.</i>

294
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,723
-Want to see?
-No, I believe you.

295
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,016
I'm just surprised, though,

296
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,060
because you are
the Christian magician.

297
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:46,438
Although you did look awfully
shredded on that cross.

298
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,855
You should have seen me

299
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,399
when they took me
out of the storage locker.

300
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:52,319
-Hmm. -But how'd I get in
the storage locker?

301
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,736
That's okay;
I know it didn't work.

302
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,363
Made the "Woops" column
in<i> Poof.</i>

303
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,532
<i>It's cool, though, man;</i>
<i>I've been there.</i>

304
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:58,699
<i>Your assistant probably</i>
<i>sabotaged you.</i>

305
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,243
I don't even use one anymore.

306
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,411
I resorted to using my own legs

307
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:03,121
in the
"Saw the Lady in Half" gag.

308
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,414
I even shaved them.

309
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:06,666
Want to feel?

310
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:07,917
Wow, they are smooth.

311
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,752
Like a lady's.

312
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,421
I think.

313
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:13,047
(laughing)

314
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,757
You're funny.

315
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,593
-Too bad we can't do this more.
-Why?

316
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:17,802
I don't know if it'd be

317
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,220
great for my reputation
to be seen

318
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:21,348
with the fundamentalist
Christian magician.

319
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,934
<i>And he was suspicious that Gob</i>
<i>might not actually be gay.</i>

320
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:27,354
MAN: Valet is closing.
The Cabriolet--

321
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,023
-license plate: "ANUS TART."
-That's me.

322
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,899
Aw, what the hell,
let's do it.

323
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,944
<i>And that's when Gob came up</i>

324
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,363
Yeah, let's risk it.

325
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,531
Right? Let's risk it!

326
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:39,032
Come on.

327
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:45,330
<i>The next day, Gob shared</i>
<i>his new plan with Tobias.</i>

328
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:46,705
Good. Seems like
you're done talking.

329
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,375
I, too, am in a relationship,

330
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,044
but mine is purely
a revenge-based deal.

331

How do you make someone
fall in love with you?

334
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,844
-Can you pass the mustard,
please? -Yeah.

335
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,471
Oh, it's easy when
you've got so much in common.

336
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:02,972
Last night, for instance,

337
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,474
we both got a case
of the munchies,

338
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:06,434
and then we went out
and we stole these pies...

339
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:10,480
<i>As it turns out, they did</i>
<i>a lot more than steal pies.</i>

340
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:14,317
<i>They had a raucous good time.</i>

341
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,776
And then the candy
bean dish right here,

342
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,153
we made those
at "Color Me Mine,"

343
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:18,655
and I know they're
kind of cockeyed,

344
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:20,615
but they remind us both
of my crooked smile.

345
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,741
Sounds like you're really
into this girl.

346
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,494
Don't call me girl, friend.

347
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,371
No, this is purely
an act of revenge,

348
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,665
filled with white-hot hate.

349
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:31,501
I'd tell you on who, but this
person is sort of a celebrity.

350
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:32,586
Oh!

351
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,753
Well, turns out my femme fatale

352
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,172
is a bit of a celebrity herself.

353
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:38,007
<i>And that's when</i>
<i>Gob found a solution</i>

354
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,884
<i>to filling one of the houses.</i>

355
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,469
...I've been looking
for a place to live.

356
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,012
That's great.
When can you move in?

357
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,723
Uh, duh! Now!

358
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:47,392
Oh, the other sex offenders
are going to be so jealous.

359
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:50,228
Wait a minute...

360
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,314
you know of other people
with similar needs?

361
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,149
<i>And that's when</i>
<i>he filled the rest.</i>

362
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,901
Oh, I have a list of men

363
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,487
that could fill
every opening you have.

364
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,780
(coughing)

365
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,866
(laughs, coughs)

366
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,286
Let me get a shot of mustard.

367
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,329
That was all cheese,
but no mustard.

368
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,081
<i>Not wanting</i>
<i>to appear desperate,</i>

369
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:13,792
<i>Gob waited till late afternoon</i>
<i>to continue his plan</i>

370
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,503
<i>to make Tony</i>
<i>fall in love with him.</i>

371
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,255
TONY (recorded):
It's Tony.

372
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:20,841
I'm not here right now,
because I'm right behind you.

373
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,594
Made you look.

374
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,137
But how did I know you looked?

375
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,764
Because I'm right behind you!

376
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,643
Made you look again.

377
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:30,935
Tony, it's Gob.

378
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,313
Man, does anybody
ever fall for that?

379
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:36,483
Listen, uh, I was just,
I was thinking about you--

380
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,526
what a fun night
we had the other night.

381
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,612
So just call me
when you get a chance.

382
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,572
Okay? All right.

383
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,574
(ringtone plays)

384
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:45,659
Wow, that was fast,
you hot little...

385
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,368
-It's your mother.
-Hi.

386
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,203
Sorry, I thought you were
somebody else.

387
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,539
I can't tell you who, 'cause I'm
dating someone famous.

388
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:54,125
<i>And that's when Gob</i>
<i>was given a new job.</i>

389
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,127
You better start
to build this wall, pronto.

390
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,755
I tried with your father,
but he can't do it.

391
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:00,757
<i>And that's when Gob</i>
<i>was told to make it</i>

392
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,592
(with Lucille):
<i>...look like major construction</i>

393
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:03,884
<i>had begun on the wall.</i>

394
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:07,096
<i>So Gob set out to find a crew.</i>

395
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:08,640
(men shouting)

396
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:11,850
-(feedback screeching)
-Who wants to... (screaming)

397
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,144
Hurt my ears.

398
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,772
Who wants
to help me build a wall...

399
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:18,191
to keep Mexicans out of America?

400
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,984
(bleep)
All right, all right!

401
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,068
(men shouting in Spanish)

402
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,529
Who wants to help me

403
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,904
build a wall for no reason?

404
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,865
It's a different wall.

405
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:26,907
(men shouting, cursing)

406
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,076
-(bleep)
-(men shouting angrily)

407
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,411
(bleep)

408
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:31,538
(Gob shouting,
feedback screeching)

409
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,956
Aah! This thing is loud!

410
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,584
<i>And so he decided to head</i>
<i>to the border ribbon</i>

411
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:38,419
<i>to put in some</i>
<i>manual labor himself.</i>

412
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:39,879
GOB: ...show everyone
that I'm not afraid of

413
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,007
the sweet sting of sweat
in my eyes.

414
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,553
<i>...when he came across</i>
<i>a local maca picker.</i>

415
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,555
You need help to make
your sign stand up?

416
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,181
Yes. No!

417
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,726
I need to find some Mexicans
to help build this wall.

418
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,185
Hey, you know what?

419
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,395
You should get the Chinese
to build your wall.

420
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,396
We make great walls.

421
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,397
That would be great.

422
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,732
How can we make that happen?

423
00:14:58,773 --> 00:14:59,858
I'm Chinese; I know all Chinese.

424
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,234
I hook you up.

425
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,610
-Well, that's, uh...
-(ringtone playing)

426
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,320
That'd be... great.

427
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:05,905
Would you get off
my (bleep), Mother!

428
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,241
Well, if I wasn't sure
you were gay, I am now.

429
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,535
It's Tony. Hey, Tony.

430
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,119
Sorry I couldn't
talk last night,

431
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,664
but, uh, I'd really love
to get together later.

432
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:17,041
This week,
or maybe Saturday, say, 5:00?

433
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,710
-Great.
-I'm thinking Little Ballroom.

434
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:21,003
Little Ballroom good?
Or you sick of Little Ballroom?

435
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,673
-I'll see you there.
-Bye.

436
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:25,258
That was Tony.
My friend Tony.

437
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,468
Oh, she sounds wonderful.

438
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,054
No... no...
I'm gonna get revenge on him

439
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,806
and destroy his life.

440
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,224
Her life.

441
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,560
Our... life.

442
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,687
Destroy our life.

443
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,064
Destroy our life.

444
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,524
That doesn't matter.
Who cares?

445
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,860
<i>But Tony Wonder</i>
<i>had a secret, too.</i>

446
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:45,361
We're on.

447
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,280
And he definitely thinks
you're gay, right?

448
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,948
Don't worry, the only thing I'm
better at than (bleep)-ing women

449
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,867
is pretending I'm gay.

450
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:52,702
Trust me, I am all man.

451
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:54,704
Give me a little leg shave?

452
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:56,289
All right, well,
you have to be careful.

453
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,331
If Gob finds out
you're straight,

454
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,125
he'll use it to ruin you,

455
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:02,295
and I'll lose the hundred grand
I stole from Lucille Austero

456
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,088
to re-brand you
as the gay magician.

457
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,466
<i>It seemed Sally Sitwell</i>
<i>had a secret also.</i>

458
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,134
I know that.

459
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,552
Why are you telling me all this?

460
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,846
'Cause if she finds out,
we both go down.

461
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,598
And I don't want
to have to sell that closet

462
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,391
as a sweat sauna on Craigslist.

463
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:16,183
-Ow!
-Ooh. Sorry.

464
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,769
It's fine.

465
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:18,812
And as long as we're recapping

466
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,647
things that we already know,

467
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,022
an inside source tells me

468
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,859
he's my ticket
to Internet billions.

469
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,152
Inside source?

470
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,069
Oh, I didn't tell you that?

471
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,237
-No.
-That's new?

472
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,157
It's "in the bag."

473
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,618
<i>Tony made that sound</i>
<i>a lot cooler than it was.</i>

474
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,702
That Fakeblock thing will
scrub it away.

475
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:35,787
You know about Fakeblock?

476
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,622
You know, that's my software.

477
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,290
I wonder if my dad thinks...

I've never done it before.

489
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,696
Anyway, he's halfway to falling
in love with me already.

490
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:13,324
I mean, he actually sounded
excited about seeing me tonight.

491
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:16,243

destroy our life with Gob.

00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:57,535
and that weird fuzzy moth
in the drain...

508
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:00,830
NARRATOR:<i> It seemed Sally</i>
<i>had two secrets.</i>

509
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,878
<i>And days later,</i>
<i>Gob was feeling pretty good.</i>

510
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,423
<i>China Garden had come through</i>
<i>with a crew to build the wall,</i>

511
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:13,009
<i>and with the help of</i>
<i>a well-placed ad,</i>

512
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:17,137
<i>he'd successfully filled all</i>
<i>the homes in Sudden Valley.</i>

513
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,140
<i>And he was on his way to</i>
<i>a hot date with Tony Wonder.</i>

514
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,936
Siri, where is
the Little Ballroom?

515
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:24,645
SIRI:
I have three matches.

516
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:27,815
(mumbles):
I'm going to need the gayest.

517
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,442
Did you say the "grayest"?

518
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,151
(snickering)

519
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,946
I need the, uh, gayest one.

520
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,614
SIRI:
Did you say the "grayest"?

521
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:35,949
I need the gayest
Little Ballroom!

522
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,618
SIRI:
Okay, Gob, try this one.

523
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:43,414
I've got to tell Michael
that I saw another map car.

524
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,124
He's gonna be blown away.

525
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,960
GOB:
<i>You don't see them a lot.</i>

526
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,628
<i>-Well...</i>
<i>-I'm fine.</i>

527
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,546
...looks like he's turning
into a parking lot.

528
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:53,173
My Little Ballroom.
Of course, yeah.

529
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,801
<i>She's got a kid,</i>
<i>he's acting like</i>

530
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,594
<i>he's Father of the Year</i>
<i>or something.</i>

531
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,137
<i>I bet he's pretending</i>
<i>Steve Holt is, like, nine.</i>

532
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,764
<i>I just saw him,</i>
<i>he looks 50.</i>

533
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,390
NARRATOR:
<i>But of course Gob was</i>

534
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,476
<i>at the wrong Little Ballroom.</i>

535
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,852
I do not get this lifestyle.

536
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,771
-Gob?
-You're mistaken.

537
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,898
Hi, there.

538
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,900
-Michael.
-Yeah.

539
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:12,652
Well, look who's here: you.

540
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,112
Where is she?

541
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,613
First of all, that's very dated
of you, Michael.

542
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,615
"He's" don't like
to be called "she's"

543
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,700
and I don't who this he-man is
that you're referring to.

544
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:20,994
No, no, no, it's a "she."
My girlfriend.

545
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:22,328
That's who I'm talking about.

546
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,871
Rebel. Rebel Alley.
Where is she?

547
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,706
-Never met him.
-It's a she.

548
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,333
Nice try.
Now what are you doing here?

549
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:28,626
You gonna meet her here
with her son, maybe,

550
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:29,752
so her son can play
in the ball pit?

551
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,378
That's disgusting, Michael.

552
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,464
-This is no place for a child.
-I know what you do.

553
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,008
Mom told me
you were bragging about

554
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,383
seeing somebody in showbiz.

555
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,218
Then I see
a frozen dove in a freezer.

556
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,971
That could be anything.

557
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,639
It said "Love each other"
on the foot band.

558
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:42,932
Yeah, that does
sound like one of mine.

559
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:44,183
Whose freezer was it in?

560
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,935
Rebel. Rebel Alley's.
Nice try, Gob.

561
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:47,436
If I want to see bad acting,

562
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:49,229
I'll go see Tobias in
<i>A Jew Comes to Dinner.</i>

563
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,690
<i>But Gob wasn't acting.</i>

564
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,151
<i>He'd just forgotten</i>
<i>that he had met</i>

565
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,861
<i>a still-partying Rebel Alley.</i>

566
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,155
It's a little dove.
He's so cute.

567
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,824
<i>And Rebel returned home</i>
<i>to an unfortunate surprise.</i>

568
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,117
(dove squawks)

569
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:06,622
<i>She felt bad,</i>
<i>so quickly put it in a bag,</i>

570
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,958
<i>wrote down the species</i>
<i>and location</i>

571
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,503
<i>from which she'd acquired it</i>
<i>and then one further caution.</i>

572
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,756
<i>It was a merry mix-up.</i>

573
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,717
<i>But neither of them</i>
<i>knew any of this.</i>

574
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,760
Honestly, I have no idea what
you're talking about, Michael.

575
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,179
Yes, you do.
I got you dead to rights.

576
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,847
Dead to rights!

577
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:25,141
If ever we were gonna
have a fight, Michael,

578
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:27,143
this would be
the safest place to do it.

579
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:29,228
-Right! Let's do it! -This gay
bar would be the best...!

580
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:32,481
...something that can fillet a
chicken and subdue an intruder.

581
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:33,649
Let's do it!

582
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,030
Back to My Little Ballroom?

583
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,614
Yeah, this is the middle
of their workday.

584
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,575
Hey! Hey! Come back here!

585
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,326
You son of a bitch, Gob!

586
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,829
You'll never catch me, Michael!

587
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:49,999
♪ You raped and pushed
and struggled ♪

588
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,084
♪ All those balls in the air...♪

589
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,128
You have to find me, Michael!

590
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,547
♪ How hard can it be? ♪

591
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,257
Gob?

592
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,384
♪ ...those balls in the air ♪

593
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:05,639
♪ But keep those
balls in the air ♪

594
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:09,602
♪ Balls in the air. ♪

595
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,437
Are we done?

596
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,730
I'm just surprisingly tired.

597
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:15,649
So tired... and so not hurt.

598
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,902
Look, I'm not the guy, Michael.

599
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:19,987
I thought you'd be proud of me.
I did what you said.

600
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,406
I filled all your...
your houses.

601
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:23,574
Hang on-- filled 'em?

602
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,534
Every last one of 'em.

603
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:26,619
With who?

604
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,371
With sex offenders.

605
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:31,749
Hey! Hey!

606
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,085
Gob, you're out of the movie!

607
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:35,878
BOY: Thanks for ruining
my birthday party.

608
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:41,383
NARRATOR:
<i>After fighting with Gob,</i>

609
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,552
<i>Michael paid a return visit</i>
<i>to his mother.</i>

610
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:44,971
-What happened to your eye?
-Oh...

611
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,639
Is that from Gob?
Was I right about him?

612
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,724
No, actually.
Want to hear a funny story?

613
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,310
You're out of the movie.

614
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:52,645
Hold on, George.

615
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:53,813
I beg your pardon?

616
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,481
Did you say George?
Is that Dad?

617
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,150
'Cause he's the one
who told me to hire Gob.

618
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:58,818
I actually owe him a call.

619
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,111
Hey, Dad, how you doing?

620
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:01,946
Y-Yes, he did.

621
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:03,197
With sex offenders.

622
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:04,865
You want
to hear something funny?

623
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:06,993
You're out of the movie!

624
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,661
Want to hold for Mom? Yeah.

625
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:11,122
Bye.

626
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:15,168
<i>And later that night,</i>
<i>Gob went to win back the trust</i>

627
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:18,296
<i>of the man he was still</i>
<i>hoping to con.</i>

628
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,880
Hey, look...

629
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,548
<i>Although he quickly</i>
<i>lost sight of that plan.</i>

630
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,302
-You're mad at me.
-You stood me up.

631
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,513
Oh, no-- Siri sent me
to the wrong "Ballroom,"

632
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,431
and then I got in this fight
with my brother

633
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,267
that didn't hurt,
it was just a whole...

634
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:32,810
Oh, is that it?
Or is it because

635
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:35,062
your boyfriend is 20
and I'm nearly twice that?

636
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:37,106
You think that I care
that you're...

637
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:38,774
three years older than me?

638
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:40,860
No! I don't--
Check my phone. Check my phone.

639
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,486
I don't need to check
your phone; come on in.

640
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,113
<i>But getting Gob's boyfriend's</i>

641
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:46,240
<i>contact information</i>
<i>out of that phone</i>

642
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:48,326
<i>was the reason</i>
<i>for Tony's charade.</i>

643
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:49,994
He hates me;
the whole family hates me.

644
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:52,246
-Damn it!
<i>-Which he remembered too late.</i>

645
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:53,664
Yeah, damn it!

646
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,582
I mean, I even helped
fill his stupid homes

647
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:58,127
with sex offenders,
and yet he still hates me.

648
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:00,129
Sex offenders need
a place to live, too.

649
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:03,883
Yes! Exactly!
That's what I always say.

650
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,384
It's, like, God...
you get me.

651
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:08,386
Well, you're an easy guy to get.

652
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,181
I can't go home;
he's probably waiting for me.

653
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:11,515
He's gonna be my boss?

654
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:12,808
He's the younger brother.

655
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,768
-How old is he?
-42.

656
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,145
Same!

657
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:18,189
My younger brother's 42, also.

658
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:19,232
Same!

659
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:20,774
But...

660
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,151
-I mean 32.
-Third... two...

661
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:23,569
-32.
-32! Same!

662
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,112
-Same! I was gonna say it.
-Same?

663
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:27,240
-I was thinking the same.
-That's so weird!

664
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:29,116
(both talking at once)

665
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:31,327
-...same.
-...same.

666
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:32,452
-Crazy!
-...zy!

667
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:33,537
Do you want a glass of wine?

668
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:34,621
I love wine.

669
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,123
-Red wine?
-I love red wine!

670
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:37,250
-Same!
-Same!

671
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,209
(laughing)

672
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:39,459
It's, like, two same.

673
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,087
-That's in-same.
-Totally in-same.

674
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:43,130
<i>It turns out the guys</i>
<i>had tons in common.</i>

675
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,673
-That's so weird.
-...weird.

676
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:46,424
-Like...

-Same.
-Same.

<i>The hours melted away...</i>

683
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:04,110
TONY:
I guess I must have been...

684
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,278
<i>...and perhaps,</i>
<i>pretending to be gay...</i>

685

...when I started saying "same."

00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:13,827
-Same. -That's about
the same time I got into magic.

689
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,829
You know, I think I got into
misdirection 'cause I just...

690
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,665
maybe I was trying to hide
my feelings or something.

691
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,710
I was just doing it
to get out of gym.

692
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:23,461
Who's Jim?

693
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:24,546
No, I... phys ed.

-Oh... kidding.
-(laughing): Right.

696
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,969

Kidding.

(Gob sighs)

705
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,368
I'll get some water.

-Yeah.
-Yeah, just...

709
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:04,295
<i>And chose not to take it.</i>

710

BOTH:
Ah.

717
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:47,004
We were really thirsty.

718
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,381
Well, I guess I should get go...

719

Yeah, I'd say stay,
but I just... I feel...

720

I just feel like we should
take it slow, you know.

721
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,179
Oh, same.

722
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:58,140
I-I would definitely stay
and have gay sex with...

723

or normal sex with you, but...

724
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,229
Yeah, I would totally have
gay sex or whatever, but...

725
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,605
just drank a lot of water,
you know.

726
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:09,318
I-I just... I just had
a lot of water, too.

727
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,986
Yeah, I don't want
to rush things.

728

-Same.
-Same.

729
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,614
You know, maybe we make
a date to do it

730
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,450
another time,
and tonight we just...

731
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:18,160
We can just sit and talk.

732
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:20,246
<i>Gob had never said anything</i>
<i>like that before.</i>

733
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,248
That would be amazing.

<i>And then he said something else</i>

Why don't we have normal sex
on Cinco?

742
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,731
Let's have normal sex on Cinco.

Whoo! Huh?

00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,170
GOB:
Well...

753
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:11,797
-(chuckles)
-How long has it been?

754
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:13,840
-It's been five years.
-What are you doing here?

755
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,760
I'm taking my five-year-old
to see<i> Fantastic Four.</i>

756
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,345
I'm pretty sure
that's an adult...

757
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:19,763
Wait, you have a five-year-old?

758
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:20,889
<i>Oui.</i>

759

What? We what?

760
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,018
No,<i> oui.</i> 
It's French for "yes."

761
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,604
As in, "Yes, I have a son,

762
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:29,106
and his father's a magician."

Don't worry. It's not you.

767
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,411
It was a real magician.

768
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:44,163
He took advantage
of how angry I was

769
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,914
when you wouldn't come out
of that cave.

770
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:47,749
He promised me
a life together, and after

771
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,294
he had his way with me,
he never wanted to see me again.

772
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:52,171

there's anything wonderful

Are you saying...

775
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,675
-Yes.
-Tony's straight?

<i>Gob felt betrayed by a person</i>
<i>he was starting to trust,</i>

<i>and he decided</i>

How would you like to spend
the night making revenge love?

779
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,687
(sighs) Uh, Jacqueline,
could you, uh...?

780
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:13,400
<i>With a plan to get revenge</i>
<i>on Tony Wonder taking shape,</i>

781
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:15,528
<i>Gob met with Ann</i>
<i>at the model home.</i>

782
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:17,946
I'm ready, Gob.

783
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:19,532
Yeah, okay, well,
don't get ready yet.

784
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:22,117
Uh, Tony's not
going to be here for a bit.

785
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,577
Tony?

786
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:26,455
You're having sex
with Tony Wonder tonight.

787
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:29,041
Well, I-I thought
we were having sex.

788
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,043
Oh. Uh, no, thank you.
(chuckles)

789
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:33,711
Listen, here's the plan--
this house is wired

790
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:36,215
with hidden cameras
from<i> Entrap a Local Predator.</i>

791
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:39,510
There, there, there and there.

792
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,303
We're going to destroy
Tony's career

793
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:44,223
by proving that he's straight
when he has sex with you

794
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,266
while you're wearing...

795
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:48,185
this Gob mask.

796
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:49,936
Oh, and this little black
mini-robe.

797
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:53,232
Just to really sell
that you're a man.

798
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,941
Why would I wear a Gob mask?

799
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,194
Because Tony's coming here
expecting to have sex with me.

800
00:28:57,236 --> 00:29:00,406
Look, in the act of having
fake gay sex,

801
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,408
you're going to take off
the mask to reveal

802
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,159
that you're having
real straight sex,

803
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:06,370
destroying his career,
and it's all going to be

804
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:08,497
captured on that camera
right there.

805
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:10,874
I don't want to have sex
with Tony.

806
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:13,544
Aren't you just a little cur...?

807
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:14,878
I have a child with him!

808
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,130
Okay, yes, new plan.

809
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,966
I'm going to wear
this Tony Wonder mask,

810
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:23,053
you're going to wear
the Gob mask, and...

811
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:25,431
I am going to have sex with you.

812
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,140
I'm sorry about all that.

813
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:30,018
And then, again, you're
going to rip off the Gob mask,

814
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,562
and the world will think
that he's straight,

815
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:32,771
and it'll ruin his career.

816
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:33,855
That's great.

817
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,190
Much simpler plan, thank you.

818
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:37,276
But the main event
is us having this...

819
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:41,405
pretend gay
but actually straight sex.

820
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:42,531
And you know what it is?

821
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:43,865
It's a straight bait.

822
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,534
I just realized,
it's a straight bait.

823
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:46,952
You ever watch those?

824
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:49,829
Good, and let me
have the room, yeah.

825
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:53,417
I need a little while
to get same.

826
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:56,670
To be the same.

It's Ann.

834
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:13,687
Awfully funny time

Yes, it is an awfully funny time

you.

837
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,612
I know I owe you child support.

Don't worry, I got
something big in the works.

839

-What are you doing here?
-Gob invited me.

841

He's planning
on getting revenge on you.

842
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:32,038
(laughs)
He would never do that.

843
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,417
Then why did he want to have sex
with me with this on?

844
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:37,670
Wait a minute.

845
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:39,713
Sex with you?

846
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:41,715

-I just... Why would he do that?

849
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:49,097
I thought he was gay.

850
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:51,433
-Tony, you're not gay, either.
-That's business.

851
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:53,602
Why do you think David Geffen
pretends to be gay?

852
00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:55,187
You think
the Shubert Organization

853
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,855
would entrust a project
like<i> Dreamgirls</i>

854
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:58,357
to a straight producer?

855
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,150
How do you know so much
about<i> Dreamgirls?</i>

856
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,068
'Cause it's my business
to know about<i> Dreamgirls.</i>

857
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,903
And if you wanted to be
in a film version

858
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:07,032
of a musical called
<i>The Magic Show,</i> done in 1974

859
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:09,618
by another secretly straight guy
named Doug Henning,

860
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,370
you'd make it
your business, too.

861
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:12,746
I mean,
they can't give everything

862
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:13,997
to Doogie Howser, right?

863
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,082
Biggest fake gay there is,
by the way.

864
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,752
But if I fund it,
then they can't say no to me.

865
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:20,879
But it's big money--
I mean, 20, 30, 40 mil.

866
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,255
Fakeblock money.

867
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,882
I can't believe
I'm telling you all this.

868
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:25,884
I... I've been
overexplaining the (bleep)

869
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,093
out of everything lately.

870
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,554
You can't tell a soul.

871
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,096
No one I know will care.

872
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,641
Look, do you want
to out Gob as gay

873
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:34,768
so it'll ruin his career
as the Christian magician?

874
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,145
-Yes, of course.
-Are you still your own legs?

875
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:39,565
And do you have toenail polish
on you right now?

876
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:42,317
Are you asking, am I wearing
any, or do I have any extra?

877
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:44,152
Because the answer
to both questions is yes.

878
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:46,655
Then we're covered.
You and I will have sex.

879
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:49,199
And you wear this Gob mask, and
I'll wear a Tony Wonder mask.

880
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:50,659
Okay, I have two questions.

881
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:52,745
One: Are you going to
move this time?

882
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:56,498
And two: Why can't I just be me
and you wear the Gob mask?

883
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:00,085
I just thought that if you
had to have sex with a man,

884
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:02,003
wouldn't it be more of a turn-on

885
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,548
to have sex with someone
that looks like you?

886
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,467
Okay.

887
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:09,553
Put these on,
and then meet me in the bedroom

888
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:12,598
in five minutes for some serious
secular intercourse.

889
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:13,973
With myself.

890
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,769
Yeah.

891
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,447
-Same.
-Same.

892
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:31,700
-Same.
-Same.

893
00:32:31,742 --> 00:32:34,160
<i>And two men who never loved</i>
<i>anyone but themselves...</i>

894
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,955
-Same. Same.
-Become... the same.

895
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:40,876
<i>...prepared to ruin</i>
<i>each other's reputation.</i>

896
00:32:40,918 --> 00:32:43,295
-Same.
-Same.

897
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:46,548
-Same.
-Same.

898
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,467
GOB:
I should dim the lights.

899
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:52,679
<i>And that's how Ann</i>
<i>not only performed</i>

900
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:56,683
<i>a real-life version of Tony's</i>
<i>most beloved illusion...</i>

901
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:58,518
Now everybody's gay!

902
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,521
<i>...but was responsible</i>
<i>for the first reported instance</i>

903
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:04,733
<i>of a Christian</i>
<i>straight-to-gay conversion.</i>

904
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:12,365
<i>Gob went downstairs</i>
<i>to take a forget-me-now...</i>

905
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,284
Is that you, Maria?

906
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:17,287
<i>...when he bumped into a</i>
<i>brother who also had a secret.</i>

907
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,498
GOB: We did make quite a mess
in that bedroom.

908
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,333
-Michael.
-Gob?

909
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,376
<i>And relished the opportunity</i>
<i>to rub it in.</i>

910
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:26,087
Besides, you could not make me
feel worse right now.

911
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,673
I'd be willing
to let you have your

912
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,466
apology back if you give me
the chance to try.

913
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:32,385
Bad example. If you were ashamed
of being in love with a man,

914
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,805
suddenly discovered
these new feelings,

915
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:36,222
something that you only
allowed to happen because

916
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,975
you thought he was gay
and you were hoping

917
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,769
to exact revenge, but then
you found out he was straight,

918
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:43,188
then you wanted to get even,
so maybe you put a mask

919
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,857
on someone and then tried
to convince yourself

920
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:47,025
that the sex you were
about to have was with yourself,

921
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:49,695
but it turned out to be him,
and all you ended up doing

922
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,822
was proving that your feelings
were real...

923
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:53,782
then I might say something like,
"Homo much?"

924
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:56,034
-It's not that.
-I said, "Bad example."

925
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:57,452
Hey, listen, Michael,
if you want,

926
00:33:57,494 --> 00:33:58,787
-we can split this.
-No.

927
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:00,706
Believe me,
this is the last time I ever

928
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:01,999
-judge you for anything
-(door opens)

929
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,000
that you ever do.

930
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,918
Oh, (bleep).

931
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,420
Is that who you were with?

932
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,840
<i>And Gob decided to be generous</i>

933
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:12,300
<i>-with his last forget-me-now...</i>
-(grunting): No!

934
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:14,511
<i>and for the first time,</i>
<i>it was Michael</i>

935
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:17,597
<i>who forgot his shame,</i>
<i>and Gob who remembered.</i>

936
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,558
Stupid, forgetful Michael.

937
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:25,313
<i>Michael wakes up and is</i>
<i>reminded of something horrible.</i>

938
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:28,191
FATHER MARSALA (over TV):
700,000. Think about it.

939
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:29,776
That is a very big number.

940
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:31,737
700,000 abortions every year...

941
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,488
NARRATOR:
<i>The amount of money he owed</i>

942
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:36,825
<i>because Tobias wanted</i>
<i>to mount this abortion.</i>

<i>he never thought he'd do...</i>

LUCILLE 2 (recorded):
Vote for Lucille!

946
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,458
-(beep)
-Hey, Lucille 2.

947
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,461
I was hoping that
we could get together

948
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:51,506
and talk about how I can
repay you that loan.

949
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:54,217
<i>...and had already done.</i>

950
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:56,386
<i>And then, with nothing</i>
<i>left to lose,</i>

951
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:58,013
<i>he makes another call.</i>

952
00:34:58,055 --> 00:35:00,098
Rebel. Yeah, Michael.

953
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,683
I need to come over.

954
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:03,435
I'm... I don't want to act

955
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:06,688
like it doesn't matter
to me anymore, 'cause it does.

956
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,106
Well, there's somebody here
right now.

957
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:09,482
I don't care.

958
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,026
The thing with
the other guy, it's...

959
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:12,819
you know, that's over,
so we don't...

960
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:15,154
we don't ever have to talk
about that ever again.

961
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,531
It's going away.

962
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:19,492
Okay, well, you can
come over later, okay?

963
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,954
-Good-bye.
-I'll see you soon.

964
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:25,999
GEORGE MICHAEL:
Who was that?

965
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:28,167
No one.
