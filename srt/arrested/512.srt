00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,436
-I have a confession.
-Oh.

4
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:22,689
[Oscar] You're not a fugitive wanted
for killing Lucille 2.

5
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:23,982
And you're not on the run.

6
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:26,943
I was just telling you that
because I've just enjoyed being

7
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,695
with you so much, and, um...

8
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:29,821
Sorry.

9
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,992
-I have a confession of my own to make.
-[Oscar] Huh?

10
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,870
I also knew
we were not being looked for.

11
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:39,831
I went along with it
because I-- I-- I wanted to spend

12
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:41,666
some more time with you.

13
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:47,172
All right.
All right, well, then go on inside

14
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:50,717
and sign out,
and, uh, let's continue the adventure.

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,260
Okay. [laughs] Okay, okay.

16
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:53,595
-But while I'm gone...
-Yeah?

17
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:56,556
Pick what you want to do when we get back.
Here's your choices:

18
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,725
lay down inside,
get scared of the dark inside,

19
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:00,518
or play hide-and-go-seek inside.

20
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:04,689
This shouldn't take too long.
I hope you don't mind waiting for me.

21
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:07,192
-Hey, I ain't going nowhere.
-[Buster] Okay.

22
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,653
[clears throat] Oh, and one more thing.
I don't like the smell of marijuana

23
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,782
or your behavior when I've caught you,
so it's me or the weed.

24
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,243

for joining us for dinner.

37
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,078
{\an8}[man] The least we can do
is pick up the check.

38
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,330
{\an8}You have burned so many phones

-Oh, that voice.

00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:11,798
{\an8}Well, shall we conclude the pleasantries
and move on to business?

43
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:14,801
{\an8}Okay, so as you probably heard,
our daughter,

44
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:17,679
{\an8}-Lindsay, lost the election.
-[Lucille] Ah, that's right,

45
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:21,182
{\an8}and her opponent Sally Sitwell
is very anti-wall.

46
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,476
{\an8}We pleaded with her
and asked her to support it,

47
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,978
{\an8}but she won't do it.

48
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,272
{\an8}-So, our hands are tied.
-[George Sr.] That's right.

49
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:30,859
{\an8}So, unfortunately, we-- we, uh,
are unable to build the wall.

50
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,152
{\an8}So unfortunate.

{\an8}[traditional Chinese music playing]

52
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,406
{\an8}Okay. Done.

53
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,949
{\an8}Hey, is this music to you guys?

54
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,243
{\an8}I mean, do you really hear this as music?

55
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,453
{\an8}But Ms. Sitwell has publicly supported

56
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,330
{\an8}the construction of the wall.

57
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:49,919
{\an8}Technically, yes, but you see,
uh, on the flip side of that...

58
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,547
We did not expect you to know that.

59
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,342
We're upset.

Look, we invested your money.
That's the truth.

00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:02,974
[Ron]  <i>...but to tell a lie</i>

I mean, just like that,
but, um, you know what?

66

-We-- We were thinking...
-Wouldn't they rather wait

67
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,319
until the investment comes to fruition?

68
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,696
We want the wall.
We'll pass on the fruition.

69
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:19,949
Well, but, the banks are closed,
you know, tomorrow being the seventh.

70
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,452

We'll talk in a couple of days.

-Oh, that's good.
-[man] No, we won't.

00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:25,997
You will hear from our people.

73
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,374
Oh, please, please sit down.
Please, can we just sit down?

74
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,711
All right? Wait, I cannot believe
I'm gonna do this, um...

75
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,422
I want to tell you the truth,

76
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:37,175
which is what my son insisted we do
from the start.

77
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,260
The doctors give him three months to--

78
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:42,513
-We spent all your money.
-What did you lie?

79
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,141
We bought the land on the border
with your money.

80
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,310
I mean, at least we thought we did,
and we were gonna

81
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,229
sell it back to the United States
for a profit,

82
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,647
and we weren't gonna tell you.

83
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,067
But guess what? We-- We bought... [laughs]

84
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,860
We bought the wrong land.

85
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,112
And then, the-- the Romneys came.

86
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,740
Uh, not the regular ones;
the Mexican Romneys.

87
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,493
-We have Romneys.
-Mm-hmm.

88
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,621
-Go on.
-Then we spent every last dime we had

89
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,957
trying to get our idiot daughter elected.

90
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,376
Who, by the way,
has completely disappeared.

91
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,087
So even if she had won,
she couldn't have helped.

92
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,673
And we've been lying to you for months.

93
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,969
Honesty's good.

94
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:25,056
And my wife is leaving me,
and I don't know what to do.

95
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,601
And I think she's [bleep] a surfer,
and I can't get hard.

96
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,478
That is more than enough honesty.

97
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,981
-Oh, noodle stab. I mean...
-We had no idea

98
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,692
how humiliating your circumstances were.

99
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,986
It is very important for our partners,

100
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,404
even in great failure,

101
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,657
to remain honorable and save face.

102
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,326
We'd like to offer you the opportunity

103
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,120
to once again experience dignity

104
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,914
by making a monetary gift to your family.

105
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:53,626
[Ron] <i>And that's when the honesty</i>
<i>unexpectedly paid off.</i>

106
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:56,587
Perhaps $3 million will suffice

107
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,715
for removing some shame.

108
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:03,219
Three million dollars. I mean,
that gets... Whew. That gets... [laughs]

109
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,388
...gets rid of a lot of-- lot of shame.

110
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,348
I mean, there would still be shame.

111
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,392
Yeah, I mean,
we had shame walking in the door,

112
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,893
but, I mean, wow...

113
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,937
Is there a bank account
we can wire the money to

114
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,481
that would avoid unwanted attention
for you?

115
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,191
[Ron] <i>The Bluths had such an account.</i>

116
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,401
Oh, yeah, uh...

117
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,902
That's... She's got that.

118
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,113
[Ron] <i>And back at the office,</i>

119
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,198

120
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,826
<i>-which he claimed was a... </i>
-Whoops! Force of habit.

Hey, Fakeblock.

122
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,580
[man] It's not the paycheck guy.
Don't worry about it.

123
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:34,334
[Ron] <i>Only to discover</i>
<i>some very disgruntled</i> <i>Fakeblock employees.</i>

124
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:36,586
Hey, Maeby.

125
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:37,879
-Hey.
-[Michael] Hi, there.

126
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:40,089
Hey, what's with the games?

127
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,133
The new president seems to think
it's good for morale.

128
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,885
[employee] We'd rather get paid.

129
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,595
[Maeby]
The new president gave you checks.

130
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,473
-You just can't, uh, cash 'em.
-You hired a president?

131
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,933
Yeah, we had to, in order to put
the company on the market.

132
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,935
But the guy I got is kind of an expert

133
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,104
at creating the illusion of success.

134
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,190
Please don't tell me
that you made Gob the president.

135
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,691
[Gob] Did somebody wonder...

136
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,238
if somebody else made Gob the president?

137
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,699
-I wonder.
-[game chimes]

138
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,494
Catchphrase could use some pruning.

139
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,829
What are you doing?
I thought my son was president.

140
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,831
No, he's chief technical officer.

141
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,625
The president goes
with the company when we sell.

142
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,669
I'm all for selling Gob,
but I thought I talked him out of that.

143
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,338
Can I talk to George Michael? Is he here?

144
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,589
[Maeby] George Michael?

145
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:23,758
Who's that?

146
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,803
He's a singer, I think. [chuckles]

147
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:29,055
Like, a gay one. And, you know,

148
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:30,765
you can't convert that away,
but yeah,

149
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:33,601
I think that guy is a singer.
Do we have Internet?

150
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,019
Uh, sorry, George Maharis.

151
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,312
No, I'm not George Maharis.

152
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,357
George Michael is George Maharis,
and he's in your old office.

153
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,775
-Oh. Thank you.
-[Gob] Don't know.

154
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,652
Once you're gay, you're gay, Michael!

155
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:46,447
[laughs] God, Michael's so stupid.
Everybody's gonna see.

156
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,866
-[knock on door]
-[Michael] Hi. Hey.

157
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,827
I'm sure you're busy.
I said I'd never do this.

158
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,370
-No, it's just--
-Am I interrupting?

159
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,872
Uh, sorry. It's--
You know how deadlines are

160
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:58,418
-with this stuff. It's tight.
-Sure. You're selling the company?

161
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,628
I thought the free office space
would help.

162
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,547
No, it's just, we have so many expenses

163
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,507
that I don't know
how I'm gonna pay the staff.

164
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,634
-[Michael] Mm-hmm.
-I've gone through this three times.

165
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,678
I'm just... [grunts] I gotta get smart.

166
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:12,140
-Well, hey, can't you get an intern?
-No, I keep getting Catwoman.

167
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,975
-What's that?
-It's the thread-count question.

168
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,935
It's gotta be the thread-count question.

169
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,396
Well, you lost me there.
Hey, you can't give up.

170
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,064
'Cause we just talked about this.

171
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,316
Bluth boys, we never give up.

172
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,527
And I hope that this isn't about Rebel.

173
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,696
I think it is a big mistake
to take her money.

174
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,156
She's your girlfriend,
not a business partner.

175
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,032
No, I agree. I'm not--
I'm not gonna do that.

176
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,035
Definitely not. Because I'm a long way
from making this thing work.

177
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,787
I can't afford to keep this thing running

178
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,873
for another year,
and that's how long it could take.

179
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,584
I'll lose the employees,
and then I'll never get a buyer.

180
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,502
I just don't think I can save it.

181
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,546
Oh, boy. Listen,
I'm sure I'm not one to talk.

182
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,381
I finally got Mom and Dad to admit

183
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,759
they've screwed the company
with that ridiculous wall project.

184
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,053
But it's over. Some things are just...

185
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,930
they're-- they're beyond saving.

186
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,057
Even if I did,
they wouldn't be able to admit it.

187
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,144
I mean,
they just do not appreciate what I do.

188
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,605
I just think it's too bad that...

189
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:03,649
I'm not gonna be able to run
the family business with my son.

190
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,277
We could've brought this thing
into the 21st century.

191
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,862
It would've been fun.

192
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,572
It sure would've been fun. Hey.

193
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,492
I got you an office-warming gift.

194
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,160
I guess now it's an office-closing gift,

195
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,912
but take a look at this.

196
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,748
Your first paycheck
at the banana stand. Look at that.

197
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,291
Oh, I just wanted to frame up

198
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,543
the-- the first one
as a reminder of the value

199
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,545
of a-- an honest day's work.

200
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,714
It's funny, I don't remember getting

201
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,508
-a paycheck from--
-You didn't.

202
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,177
No, I couldn't give this to you
because you were underage.

203
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,304
In fact, I couldn't pay you,
period, as an employee

204
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,972
without getting in trouble
with the government.

205
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,016
I think we had you coded as a topping.

206
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,435
No, in fact, where is it?
There it is, right there.

207
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,313
"Payment of two drums
of dried George Michael."

208
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:45,066
-"A cocoa-based, non-digestive... "
-"Colorant."

209
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,817
-I used to love those.
-[Michael] Yeah.

210
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,070
-I still do, kiddo.
-[chuckles softly]

211
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:53,658
Well, maybe we're gonna end up together
in the banana stand someday.

212
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,369
Mm. Well, there's always money
in the banana stand.

213
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,246
-Right.
-Where is that from?

214
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,122
-Is that from something?
-It's the only part of the business

215
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,542
-that always turned a profit.
-Right. Well, I know it did.

216
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,003
Although, I just--
I went through the books recently,

217
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,631
and I did not see any income
from the banana stand.

218
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,926
-Wouldn't have been much.
-Right, but it would've been something.

219
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,720
They would've had to have kept it.
Let me see that check again.

220
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:20,685
-That is not our banana logo, is it?
-[George Michael] No.

221
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,229
-Guess that's the bank's logo?
-No.

222
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,231
That's an island.

223
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,942
This is a check from the Cayman Islands.

224
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:30,361
[Ron] <i>It appeared there was</i>
<i>at least one account</i>

225
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:33,489
<i>-Michael hadn't been privy to.</i>
-[George Michael] I'll tell you what,

226
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,825
it feels good to finally hold this check
in my hands.

227
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:39,412
-Just symbolically, after...
-George Michael, that check...

228
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,289
-Rip it up?
-[Michael] No.

229
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,291
But, uh, give it to me.
It's not even for you.

230
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,417
It's for toppings.

231
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,129
[Ron] <i>George and Lucille, meanwhile,</i>

232
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,506
<i>were celebrating their success</i>
<i>with the Chinese.</i>

233
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,632
You were brilliant.

234
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,010
Wow. Three million dollars.

235
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,721
When Michael says honesty pays,
he was right.

236
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,097
Three million!

237
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,890
Oh, hey. How'd it go?

238
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,143
-What are you doing here?
-Oh, I asked him to come.

239
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,520
Dusty's an expert on Orient-- Uh...

240
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,899
<i>-Asian </i>inscrutability.
-Very good.

241
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,235
-So it went good?
-[both] Oh.

242
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,738
Excellent.
We told them we lost all their money,

243
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,032
and they gave us $3 million.

244
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,285
[George Sr.] So, uh,
what's the proper Asian response to that?

245
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,579
-You can't keep it.
-What?

246
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:22,913
You're supposed to give it back.

247
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,749
That way, you can save face.

248
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,751
I lost this face when I was 65.

249
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,753
I'm keeping the money.

250
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:30,338
They didn't give it to you as a gift.

251
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,341
They gave it to you as a chance
to regain your pride.

252
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,177
If you keep the money,
they'll be mildly displeased

253
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,888
and probably seek
a merciless revenge.

254
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:42,183
But if you give it back to them,
see, that's it, you're out.

255
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,060
Hard to hear, I know.

256
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,312
But there's freedom for you
in the exchange.

257
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,898
[Ron] <i>Dusty had more wisdom</i>
<i>than it appeared.</i>

258
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,567
-You said we'd get ice cream.
-[Lucille gasps]

259
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,903
I have to get Dusty ice cream.

260
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,572
-Um...
-[door opens]

261
00:10:58,616 --> 00:10:59,700
[door closes]

262
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,955
[Ron] <i>Meanwhile, Maeby was growing tired</i>
<i>of her living conditions.</i>

263
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,334
-[Maeby] Stan, turn down Wayne Brady!
-I surely couldn't. [laughs]

264
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:11,462
[troupe laughs]

265
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,633
Anyway, none of it was our fault.

266
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:19,845
For whatever reason,
our dreams have not panned out.

267
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,555
[DeBrie] I just wanted to get out

268
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,140
of doing things like <i>Straightbait.</i>

269
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,434
I just couldn't do
another group [bleep] scene,

270
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,520
but I love staying at Tent City.

271
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:30,106
Yes, but that turned out to be
a travel and adventure store.

272
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,234
And we were squatting right in the middle
of their summer two-for-one.

273
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:36,362
But that's when we met Buster,
who told us where you were.

274
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,656
Guys, this is not an option.

275
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,491
These two aren't even our real family.

276
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:43,411
Besides, Stan's already getting suspicious
of me as an old lady.

277
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,162
He's certainly not gonna buy it from you.

278
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,832
And I'm not gonna last much longer
if I can't get rid of this guy.

279
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,834
[Murph] Oh, like-- like a boyfriend?

280
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,586
'Cause you're rather quite attractive
for an older lady.

281
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,089
[Tobias] That is your half-sister.

282
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,842
Okay, the party.

283
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,386
'Cause I was gonna say,
does she have, like, a half-daughter?

284
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,263
-Oh, that's not...
-What is this?

285
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,597
Voices up. [laughs]

286
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,558
[in high-pitched voice] <i>Enchanté.</i>

287
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,185
Are these people your family?

288
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,062
Is that why you wanted me to go?

289
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,609
[Ron] <i>And caught with nowhere to hide,</i>

290
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,653

Yes. They are.

292
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,035
I shall pack my things.

293
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,040
[Maeby] Well, that was a freebie.

294
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,752
Now I just gotta figure out
how to get rid of you guys.

295

-Group hug.
-No. I don't want to...

[Ron] <i>And while Maeby had finally accepted</i>

301
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,936
<i>Michael was ready to investigate his.</i>

[Michael] Where are you,
banana stand money?

303
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,371
"There's always money
in the banana stand."

304
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,793
That's gotta be from <i>South Park.</i>

305
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,255
[Ron] <i>Back at the office,</i>
<i>the employees were growing restless.</i>

306
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,132
Which one is getting suspicious?

307
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,009
Yeah, I think all of them.

308
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,887
They keep throwing
these tough tech questions at me, like,

309
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,806
"What should we be working on?"
Stuff like that.

310
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,808
I hate "What should we be working on?"

311
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,643
'Cause then you're tempted to be like,

312
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,686
"Know what?
We need you to invent Fakeblock."

313
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,813
The minute you say that...

314
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,439
Then they know there's no Fakeblock.

315
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,733
Yeah. I mean, isn't this why
we hired a president?

316
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,860
Exactly to not answer these questions.

317
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,863
[George Michael] He said
he's putting together some surprise.

318
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,615
You know what these people need?

319
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:47,451
A little leadership
and a little inspiration.

320
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,662
So go give it to 'em. There you go.

321
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,705
-Wait, me? Well, I don't...
-[Maeby] Get out there.

322
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:55,876
Hey, guys.

323
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,714
-Yo.
-[man] Hey.

324
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,260
All right, question:

325
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:08,013
How many of you wake up
with a knot in your stomach?

326
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,061
Right. Me, too.

327
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,606
But I like to think of that knot
in my stomach

328
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,026
as a little ball of energy.

329
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,614
You know, it keeps me frightened

330
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,157
when I should be calm.

331
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,120
It pumps adrenaline through my veins

332
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,999
when ordinary blood is what I need.

333
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:40,379
But, you know, all of these things
can create a winning spirit.

334
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,300
One that I would like
for all of you to share in.

335
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,928
So that we can turn those knots
in our stomach

336
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,139
into why-nots.

337
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,933
-[employees murmur in approval]
-You know?

338
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,519
People say there-- there's no such thing

339
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,105
as privacy on the Internet.

340
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,982
-Well, why not?
-Why not?

341
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,483
-[man 2] Yeah.
-Right.

342
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,235
People say no one can build

343
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,446
a completely impenetrable wall.

344
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:08,240
-Why not?
-[employees] Why not?

345
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,451
And, you know, people say
you shouldn't start a company

346
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,745
without cracking the technology

347
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,707
that supports the flagship product
of the company.

348
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,626
For obvious reasons.

349
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,961
-Well, why not?
-[employees] Why not?

350
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,589
And what if you find out
you're never gonna get paid,

351
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,174
there is no product, and you're like,

352
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,967
"Well, we can't let him get away
with this."

353
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,887
-Well, why not?
-[employees murmuring]

354
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,805
[Ron] <i>That may have been a step too far.</i>

355
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:32,848
<i>But it wouldn't matter,</i>

356
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,351
<i>because Maeby had just gotten</i>
<i>some good news.</i>

357
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,685
Sorry, um, we-- we did it.

358
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,938
-What?
-We just sold Fakeblock.

359
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,648
-What?
-Yeah.

360
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,984
-We sold it? Uh, how much?
-Yeah.

361
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,111
Three million dollars.

362
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,947
-Three million dollars?
-[Maeby] Yeah.

363
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,115
That's way more
than Rebel was ever offering.

364
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,575
There's no way
she can be mad at me.

365
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,202
Who cares if she's mad
at you or not?

366
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,664
-We did it. We are geniuses.
-[George Michael] I can stop lying to Dad.

367
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,415
I mean, I feel bad for the new owner.

368
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,793
It's bogus software. I mean,
what if it bankrupts them?

369
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:01,710
Oh, click.

370
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,212
How sorry can you feel for some guy

371
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:07,716
who's obviously incredibly rich
and has $3 million to drop

372
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,135
on a .wav file
that's just the sound of a piece of wood.

373
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,013
[George Michael, laughing]
You know...

374
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,765
We had those checks issued to you,

375
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,351
and you're thinking,
"We want to cash those checks."

376
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,687
-Well, why not?
-[employees] Why not?

377
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,980
Why the hell not?

378
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,691
-[laughs] Yeah.
-Keep doing what you're doing.

379
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,067
-Cash those checks.
-[employees whoop]

380
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,027
-[George Michael] We've got jobs.
-[Ron] <i>While they were</i>

381
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,779
<i>-getting out of the business...</i>
-[Maeby] Except us.

382
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:31,198
-Yeah, we're out of here.
<i>-...directly upstairs,</i>

383
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,951
<i>George and Lucille were finally</i>
<i>back in it.</i>

384
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:36,078
-Hello, hello.
-[gasps] There he is,

385
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,871
the man of the hour!

386
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:39,873
You all right, Mom?

387
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,667
I'm just happy to see you.

388
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:42,918
That's what's off.

389
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,462
How was that meeting
with the Chinese investors?

390
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,840
It was fantastic. I mean,

391
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,967
that advice you gave us,
the honesty thing,

392
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,927
it was-- it was great. Thank you.

393
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,389
The truth came out of my mouth
as easy as any lie I could've thought of.

394
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,141
[George Sr.] She was so believable.

395
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,851
I thought she <i>was </i>lying.

396
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,311
[Lucille] It was
like the opposite of Pinocchio.

397
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,814
I swear, I think my nose got smaller.

398
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,524
Well, wouldn't have been the first time.

399
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,359
[George Sr.] Anyway, it worked.

400
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,070
The wall is off,
and we are out of that contract.

401
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,530
Everything is good.

402
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,532
-And we can start over.
-That's so great.

403
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,534
That's so great. That's just...
It's perfect.

404
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,202
You-- You know, you guys

405
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,872
finally discovered the value
of telling the truth.

406
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,874
I just-- I wish that you had learned that

407
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,625
before you lied to me.

408
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,544
Can you be more specific with that?

409
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:28,172
-There's been a number of lies.
-[Michael] Sure.

410
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,215
When you told me
that this company was bankrupt.

411
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,634
-But we <i>are </i>bankrupt, Michael.
-[George Sr.] Flat broke.

412
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:36,430
But the family business is still alive,
and the Bluths are back.

413
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:39,016
-We are bigger and better than ever.
-[Michael] Okay.

414
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:42,394
I dug a little bit deeper,
and I found some extra capital.

415
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,604
Really? That's fantastic.

416
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:44,563
-But how much?
-Yeah.

417
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,315
Hey, um... Oh, everybody's here.

418
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,192
-Hi.
-I was hoping to talk to you for a minute.

419
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,319
I have something
I want to discuss with you, too.

420
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,279
I was just gonna call down,
have you come up.

421
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:53,906
Mine is private. It's business-related.

422
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,909
Well, this is a business conference room.
Why don't you share it here?

423
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,036
-[sighs]
-You might as well just tell him.

424
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,665
-I sold Fakeblock.
-[Ron] <i>And as George Michael</i>

425
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,418
<i>prepared himself</i>
<i>for his father's disappointment...</i>

426
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,628
You what?

427
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,172
That's so great!

428
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,133
-You're not disappointed?
-Disappointed?

429
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:16,053
No, I'm not disappointed.
Boy, George Michael.

430
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,306
-And we got three mil for it.
-Come on.

431
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,767
You sold your first business,
and you got three million?

432
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:25,729
[shrieks] Three mil?
That is such great news!

433
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:29,441
Mr. Big Business,
sold your company. How do you feel?

434
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,902
To be honest,
I feel incredibly relieved.

435
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,738
I'm glad I stuck it out
and didn't declare bankruptcy.

436
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,365
It's been a tremendous pressure on us.

437
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:39,326
We had to pay off the employees,
and the bank took the rest of it,

438
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:42,579
-but I'm glad I'm back at zero.
-[George Sr.] We're both at zero.

439
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,456
-It's great.
-Did this by himself.

440
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,333
All that burden on your shoulders.

441
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,710
No one to help you. A little baby Atlas.

442
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,463
-Oh, is that how you see me?
-Hmm? Oh, doesn't matter.

443
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,882
Hey, I got an announcement
to make myself, okay?

444
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,300
Since I found some extra money,

445
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,970
I decided to expand.
And what is the company motto?

446
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,055
Find a little extra money,
put it in a Bluth.

447
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,475
<i>I </i>bought Fakeblock.

448
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:05,727
What?

449
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,312
[Maeby] No, um...

450
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,607
No, this company, uh, B.S. Enterprises,
bought Fakeblock.

451
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,777
I'm B.S. Enterprises.
It-- It was "Banana Stand,"

452
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,362
but it's also got a second meaning.

453
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,114
-Bullshit.
-Bluth and Son.

454
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:21,910
I bought you! I had to use a shell company
because I knew

455
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,287
you were gonna give me
a discount,

456
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,580
and I wasn't gonna have that.

457
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,124
You bought Fakeblock? This is...

458
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,376
This is a dream come true, is it not?

459
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:30,878
That's how I felt when I found

460
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,671
the money for it in a hidden account.

461
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,465
Well, that certainly explains
the complete lack of vetting

462
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,718
-of our software.
-[Michael] Mm-hmm, sure. Listen,

463
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,928
I'm not gonna get involved
in any of that tech stuff,

464
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,805
even though I did spend
that couple of months

465
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,183
at the Search campus.
But I'm not gonna start coding,

466
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:47,102
'cause if Fakeblock doesn't work,
we lose both companies for good.

467
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,061
You understand?

468
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,898
-[George Michael] I thought it was over.
-You thought it was over.

469
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,649
Look how emotional he is, huh?

470
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:56,028
Listen, that's why I stepped in.
Fakeblock ain't going nowhere.

471
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:59,907
[Ron] <i>But while Michael enjoyed</i>
<i>that the news made his son so happy,</i>

472
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,701
<i>he was even more eager</i>
<i>to see it do the opposite</i>

473
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:05,370
<i>-to his parents. </i>
-Where'd you find that three million?

474
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,956
In your banana stand slush fund.

475
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,875
I mean, I-- I know that you have been

476
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,545
ripping us off with money
for years, but $3 million?

477
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,505
-Shh.
-That's not our money, Michael.

478
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,007
Listen to me.
That money was given

479
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,219
to us by the Chinese
so we could give it back to them.

480
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,887
It was face-saving money.

481
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:24,139
And now you've spent it,
and on what?

482
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,308
My son's future.
And that money's gonna now save

483
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,769
the company, because it's invested
in something valuable.

484
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,355
[George Sr.] We were out.
You understand?

485
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,482
We were out. No wall. No wall.

486
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,859
But if the Chinese see
we're buying companies,

487
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,277
they're going to want it now.

488
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,529
And we are screwed.
Do you understand that?

489
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,950
You, me,
and especially George Michael.

490
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,993
-Unless you get the money back from him.
-No, no.

491
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,120
No, no. George Michael's
got nothing to do with this.

492
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,747
You better tell that to the Chinese,

493
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,875

He paid off his debts.

George Michael,
tell them how great your company is

503

and that the son they can't compliment
is about to make them rich.

504

Tell them that I made the right choice.

"Wait until you find out
who the president is"?

516
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:54,688
Yes, but then we figured it out,
and your father said, "Oh, no."

517

[George Sr.] So we've got $3 million

if it was his right hand,

willing to spend 3KK on my company,

529
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:35,979
-might be able to spread wealth on myself.
-Did my hand get off on this floor?

Well, look who finally decided to show up.
