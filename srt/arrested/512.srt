00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,436
-I have a confession.
-Oh.

4
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:22,689
[Oscar] You're not a fugitive wanted
for killing Lucille 2.

5
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:23,982
And you're not on the run.

6
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:26,943
I was just telling you that
because I've just enjoyed being

7
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,695
with you so much, and, um...

8
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:29,821
Sorry.

9
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,992
-I have a confession of my own to make.
-[Oscar] Huh?

10
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,870
I also knew
we were not being looked for.

11
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:39,831
I went along with it
because I-- I-- I wanted to spend

12
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:41,666
some more time with you.

13
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:47,172
All right.
All right, well, then go on inside

14
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:50,717
and sign out,
and, uh, let's continue the adventure.

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,260
Okay. [laughs] Okay, okay.

16
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:53,595
-But while I'm gone...
-Yeah?

17
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:56,556
Pick what you want to do when we get back.
Here's your choices:

18
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,725
lay down inside,
get scared of the dark inside,

19
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:00,518
or play hide-and-go-seek inside.

20
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:04,689
This shouldn't take too long.
I hope you don't mind waiting for me.

21
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:07,192
-Hey, I ain't going nowhere.
-[Buster] Okay.

22
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,653
[clears throat] Oh, and one more thing.
I don't like the smell of marijuana

23
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,782
or your behavior when I've caught you,
so it's me or the weed.

24
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,243

{\an8}[man] The least we can do
is pick up the check.

38
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,330
{\an8}You have burned so many phones

00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:11,798
{\an8}Well, shall we conclude the pleasantries
and move on to business?

43
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:14,801
{\an8}Okay, so as you probably heard,
our daughter,

44
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:17,679
{\an8}-Lindsay, lost the election.
-[Lucille] Ah, that's right,

45
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:21,182
{\an8}and her opponent Sally Sitwell
is very anti-wall.

46
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,476
{\an8}We pleaded with her
and asked her to support it,

47
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,978
{\an8}but she won't do it.

48
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,272
{\an8}-So, our hands are tied.
-[George Sr.] That's right.

49
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:30,859
{\an8}So, unfortunately, we-- we, uh,
are unable to build the wall.

50
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,152
{\an8}So unfortunate.

{\an8}[traditional Chinese music playing]

52
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,406
{\an8}Okay. Done.

00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,949
{\an8}Hey, is this music to you guys?

54
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,243
{\an8}I mean, do you really hear this as music?

55
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,453
{\an8}But Ms. Sitwell has publicly supported

56
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,330
{\an8}the construction of the wall.

57
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:49,919
{\an8}Technically, yes, but you see,
uh, on the flip side of that...

58
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,547
We did not expect you to know that.

59
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,342
We're upset.

Look, we invested your money.
That's the truth.

[Ron] Â <i>...but to tell a lie</i>

66

-We-- We were thinking...
-Wouldn't they rather wait

67
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,319
until the investment comes to fruition?

68
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,696
We want the wall.
We'll pass on the fruition.

00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:19,949
Well, but, the banks are closed,
you know, tomorrow being the seventh.

70
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,452

We'll talk in a couple of days.

-Oh, that's good.
-[man] No, we won't.

You will hear from our people.

73
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,374
Oh, please, please sit down.
Please, can we just sit down?

74
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,711
All right? Wait, I cannot believe
I'm gonna do this, um...

75
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,422
I want to tell you the truth,

76
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:37,175
which is what my son insisted we do
from the start.

77
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,260
The doctors give him three months to--

78
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:42,513
-We spent all your money.
-What did you lie?

79
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,141
We bought the land on the border
with your money.

80
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,310
I mean, at least we thought we did,
and we were gonna

81
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,229
sell it back to the United States
for a profit,

82
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,647
and we weren't gonna tell you.

83
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,067
But guess what? We-- We bought... [laughs]

84
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,860
We bought the wrong land.

85
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,112
And then, the-- the Romneys came.

86
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,740
Uh, not the regular ones;
the Mexican Romneys.

87
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,493
-We have Romneys.
-Mm-hmm.

88
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,621
-Go on.
-Then we spent every last dime we had

89
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,957
trying to get our idiot daughter elected.

90
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,376
Who, by the way,
has completely disappeared.

91
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,087
So even if she had won,
she couldn't have helped.

92
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,673
And we've been lying to you for months.

93
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,969
Honesty's good.

94
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:25,056
And my wife is leaving me,
and I don't know what to do.

95
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,601
And I think she's [bleep] a surfer,
and I can't get hard.

96
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,478
That is more than enough honesty.

97
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,981
-Oh, noodle stab. I mean...
-We had no idea

98
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,692
how humiliating your circumstances were.

99
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,986
It is very important for our partners,

100
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,404
even in great failure,

101
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,657
to remain honorable and save face.

102
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,326
We'd like to offer you the opportunity

103
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,120
to once again experience dignity

104
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,914
by making a monetary gift to your family.

105
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:53,626
[Ron] <i>And that's when the honesty</i>
<i>unexpectedly paid off.</i>

106
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:56,587
Perhaps $3 million will suffice

107
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,715
for removing some shame.

108
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:03,219
Three million dollars. I mean,
that gets... Whew. That gets... [laughs]

109
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,388
...gets rid of a lot of-- lot of shame.

110
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,348
I mean, there would still be shame.

111
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,392
Yeah, I mean,
we had shame walking in the door,

112
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,893
but, I mean, wow...

113
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,937
Is there a bank account
we can wire the money to

114
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,481
that would avoid unwanted attention
for you?

115
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,191
[Ron] <i>The Bluths had such an account.</i>

116
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,401
Oh, yeah, uh...

117
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,902

118
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,113
[Ron] <i>And back at the office,</i>

119
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,198

120
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,826
<i>-which he claimed was a... </i>
-Whoops! Force of habit.

Hey, Fakeblock.

122
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,580
[man] It's not the paycheck guy.
Don't worry about it.

123
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:34,334
[Ron] <i>Only to discover</i>
<i>some very disgruntled</i> <i>Fakeblock employees.</i>

124
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:36,586
Hey, Maeby.

125
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:37,879
-Hey.
-[Michael] Hi, there.

126
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:40,089
Hey, what's with the games?

127
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,133
The new president seems to think
it's good for morale.

128
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,885
[employee] We'd rather get paid.

129
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,595
[Maeby]
The new president gave you checks.

130
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,473
-You just can't, uh, cash 'em.
-You hired a president?

131
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,933
Yeah, we had to, in order to put
the company on the market.

132
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,935
But the guy I got is kind of an expert

133
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,104
at creating the illusion of success.

134
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,190
Please don't tell me
that you made Gob the president.

135
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,691
[Gob] Did somebody wonder...

136
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,238
if somebody else made Gob the president?

137
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,699
-I wonder.
-[game chimes]

138
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,494
Catchphrase could use some pruning.

139
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,829
What are you doing?
I thought my son was president.

140
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,831
No, he's chief technical officer.

141
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,625
The president goes
with the company when we sell.

142
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,669
I'm all for selling Gob,
but I thought I talked him out of that.

143
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,338
Can I talk to George Michael? Is he here?

144
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,589
[Maeby] George Michael?

145
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:23,758
Who's that?

146
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,803
He's a singer, I think. [chuckles]

147
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:29,055
Like, a gay one. And, you know,

148
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:30,765
you can't convert that away,
but yeah,

149
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:33,601
I think that guy is a singer.
Do we have Internet?

150
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,019
Uh, sorry, George Maharis.

151
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,312
No, I'm not George Maharis.

152
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,357
George Michael is George Maharis,
and he's in your old office.

153
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,775
-Oh. Thank you.
-[Gob] Don't know.

154
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,652
Once you're gay, you're gay, Michael!

155
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:46,447
[laughs] God, Michael's so stupid.
Everybody's gonna see.

156
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,866
-[knock on door]
-[Michael] Hi. Hey.

157
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,827
I'm sure you're busy.
I said I'd never do this.

158
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,370
-No, it's just--
-Am I interrupting?

159
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,872
Uh, sorry. It's--
You know how deadlines are

160
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:58,418
-with this stuff. It's tight.
-Sure. You're selling the company?

161
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,628
I thought the free office space
would help.

162
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,547
No, it's just, we have so many expenses

163
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,507
that I don't know
how I'm gonna pay the staff.

164
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,634
-[Michael] Mm-hmm.
-I've gone through this three times.

165
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,678
I'm just... [grunts] I gotta get smart.

166
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:12,140
-Well, hey, can't you get an intern?
-No, I keep getting Catwoman.

167
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,975
-What's that?
-It's the thread-count question.

168
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,935
It's gotta be the thread-count question.

169
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,396
Well, you lost me there.
Hey, you can't give up.

170
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,064
'Cause we just talked about this.

171
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,316
Bluth boys, we never give up.

172
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,527
And I hope that this isn't about Rebel.

173
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,696
I think it is a big mistake
to take her money.

174
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,156
She's your girlfriend,
not a business partner.

175
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,032
No, I agree. I'm not--
I'm not gonna do that.

176
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,035
Definitely not. Because I'm a long way
from making this thing work.

177
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,787
I can't afford to keep this thing running

178
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,873
for another year,
and that's how long it could take.

179
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,584
I'll lose the employees,
and then I'll never get a buyer.

180
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,502
I just don't think I can save it.

181
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,546
Oh, boy. Listen,
I'm sure I'm not one to talk.

182
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,381
I finally got Mom and Dad to admit

183
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,759
they've screwed the company
with that ridiculous wall project.

184
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,053
But it's over. Some things are just...

185
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,930
they're-- they're beyond saving.

186
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,057
Even if I did,
they wouldn't be able to admit it.

187
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,144
I mean,
they just do not appreciate what I do.

188
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,605
I just think it's too bad that...

189
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:03,649
I'm not gonna be able to run
the family business with my son.

190
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,277
We could've brought this thing
into the 21st century.

191
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,862
It would've been fun.

192
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,572
It sure would've been fun. Hey.

193
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,492
I got you an office-warming gift.

194
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,160
I guess now it's an office-closing gift,

195
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,912
but take a look at this.

196
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,748
Your first paycheck
at the banana stand. Look at that.

197
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,291
Oh, I just wanted to frame up

198
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,543
the-- the first one
as a reminder of the value

199
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,545
of a-- an honest day's work.

200
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,714
It's funny, I don't remember getting

201
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,508
-a paycheck from--
-You didn't.

202
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,177
No, I couldn't give this to you
because you were underage.

203
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,304
In fact, I couldn't pay you,
period, as an employee

204
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,972
without getting in trouble
with the government.

205
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,016
I think we had you coded as a topping.

206
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,435
No, in fact, where is it?
There it is, right there.

207
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,313
"Payment of two drums
of dried George Michael."

208
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:45,066
-"A cocoa-based, non-digestive... "
-"Colorant."

209
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,817
-I used to love those.
-[Michael] Yeah.

210
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,070
-I still do, kiddo.
-[chuckles softly]

211
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:53,658
Well, maybe we're gonna end up together
in the banana stand someday.

212
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,369
Mm. Well, there's always money
in the banana stand.

213
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,246
-Right.
-Where is that from?

214
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,122
-Is that from something?
-It's the only part of the business

215
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,542
-that always turned a profit.
-Right. Well, I know it did.

216
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,003
Although, I just--
I went through the books recently,

217
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,631
and I did not see any income
from the banana stand.

218
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,926
-Wouldn't have been much.
-Right, but it would've been something.

219
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,720
They would've had to have kept it.
Let me see that check again.

220
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:20,685
-That is not our banana logo, is it?
-[George Michael] No.

221
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,229
-Guess that's the bank's logo?
-No.

222
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,231
That's an island.

223
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,942
This is a check from the Cayman Islands.

224
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:30,361
[Ron] <i>It appeared there was</i>
<i>at least one account</i>

225
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:33,489
<i>-Michael hadn't been privy to.</i>
-[George Michael] I'll tell you what,

226
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,825
it feels good to finally hold this check
in my hands.

227
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:39,412
-Just symbolically, after...
-George Michael, that check...

228
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,289
-Rip it up?
-[Michael] No.

229
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,291
But, uh, give it to me.
It's not even for you.

230
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,417
It's for toppings.

231
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,129
[Ron] <i>George and Lucille, meanwhile,</i>

232
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,506
<i>were celebrating their success</i>
<i>with the Chinese.</i>

233
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,632
You were brilliant.

234
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,010
Wow. Three million dollars.

235
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,721
When Michael says honesty pays,
he was right.

236
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,097
Three million!

237
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,890
Oh, hey. How'd it go?

238
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,143
-What are you doing here?
-Oh, I asked him to come.

239
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,520
Dusty's an expert on Orient-- Uh...

240
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,899
<i>-Asian </i>inscrutability.
-Very good.

241
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,235
-So it went good?
-[both] Oh.

242
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,738
Excellent.
We told them we lost all their money,

243
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,032
and they gave us $3 million.

244
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,285
[George Sr.] So, uh,
what's the proper Asian response to that?

245
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,579
-You can't keep it.
-What?

246
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:22,913
You're supposed to give it back.

247
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,749
That way, you can save face.

248
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,751
I lost this face when I was 65.

249
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,753
I'm keeping the money.

250
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:30,338
They didn't give it to you as a gift.

251
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,341
They gave it to you as a chance
to regain your pride.

252
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,177
If you keep the money,
they'll be mildly displeased

253
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,888
and probably seek
a merciless revenge.

254
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:42,183
But if you give it back to them,
see, that's it, you're out.

255
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,060
Hard to hear, I know.

256
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,312
But there's freedom for you
in the exchange.

257
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,898
[Ron] <i>Dusty had more wisdom</i>
<i>than it appeared.</i>

258
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,567
-You said we'd get ice cream.
-[Lucille gasps]

259
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,903
I have to get Dusty ice cream.

260
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,572
-Um...
-[door opens]

261
00:10:58,616 --> 00:10:59,700
[door closes]

262
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,955
[Ron] <i>Meanwhile, Maeby was growing tired</i>
<i>of her living conditions.</i>

263
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,334
-[Maeby] Stan, turn down Wayne Brady!
-I surely couldn't. [laughs]

264
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:11,462
[troupe laughs]

265
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,633
Anyway, none of it was our fault.

266
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:19,845
For whatever reason,
our dreams have not panned out.

267
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,555
[DeBrie] I just wanted to get out

268
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,140
of doing things like <i>Straightbait.</i>

269
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,434
I just couldn't do
another group [bleep] scene,

270
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,520
but I love staying at Tent City.

271
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:30,106
Yes, but that turned out to be
a travel and adventure store.

272
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,234
And we were squatting right in the middle
of their summer two-for-one.

273
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:36,362
But that's when we met Buster,
who told us where you were.

274
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,656
Guys, this is not an option.

275
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,491
These two aren't even our real family.

276
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:43,411
Besides, Stan's already getting suspicious
of me as an old lady.

277
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,162
He's certainly not gonna buy it from you.

278
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,832
And I'm not gonna last much longer
if I can't get rid of this guy.

279
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,834
[Murph] Oh, like-- like a boyfriend?

280
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,586
'Cause you're rather quite attractive
for an older lady.

281
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,089
[Tobias] That is your half-sister.

282
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,842
Okay, the party.

283
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,386
'Cause I was gonna say,
does she have, like, a half-daughter?

284
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,263
-Oh, that's not...
-What is this?

285
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,597
Voices up. [laughs]

Are these people your family?

288
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,062
Is that why you wanted me to go?

289

[Ron] <i>And caught with nowhere to hide,</i>

290

Yes. They are.

292
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,035
I shall pack my things.

293
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,040
[Maeby] Well, that was a freebie.

294
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,752
Now I just gotta figure out
how to get rid of you guys.

295

<i>Michael was ready to investigate his.</i>

[Michael] Where are you,
banana stand money?

00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,371
"There's always money
in the banana stand."

304
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,793
That's gotta be from <i>South Park.</i>

305

[Ron] <i>Back atÂ the office,</i>
<i>the employees were growing restless.</i>

306
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,132
Which one is getting suspicious?

307
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,009
Yeah, I think all of them.

308
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,887
They keep throwing
these tough tech questions at me, like,

309
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,806
"What should we be working on?"
Stuff like that.

310
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,808
I hate "What should we be working on?"

311
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,643
'Cause then you're tempted to be like,

312
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,686
"Know what?
We need you to invent Fakeblock."

313
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,813
The minute you say that...

314
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,439
Then they know there's no Fakeblock.

315
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,733
Yeah. I mean, isn't this why
we hired a president?

316
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,860
Exactly to not answer these questions.

317
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,863
[George Michael] He said
he's putting together some surprise.

318
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,615
You know what these people need?

319
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:47,451
A little leadership
and a little inspiration.

320
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,662
So go give it to 'em. There you go.

321
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,705
-Wait, me? Well, I don't...
-[Maeby] Get out there.

322
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:55,876
Hey, guys.

323
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,714
-Yo.
-[man] Hey.

324
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,260
All right, question:

325
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:08,013
How many of you wake up
with a knot in your stomach?

326
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,061
Right. Me, too.

327
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,606
But I like to think of that knot
in my stomach

328
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,026
as a little ball of energy.

329
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,614
You know, it keeps me frightened

330
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,157
when I should be calm.

331
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,120
It pumps adrenaline through my veins

332
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,999
when ordinary blood is what I need.

333
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:40,379
But, you know, all of these things
can create a winning spirit.

334
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,300
One that I would like
for all of you to share in.

335
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,928
So that we can turn those knots
in our stomach

336
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,139
into why-nots.

337
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,933
-[employees murmur in approval]
-You know?

338
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,519
People say there-- there's no such thing

339
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,105
as privacy on the Internet.

340
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,982
-Well, why not?
-Why not?

341
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,483
-[man 2] Yeah.
-Right.

342
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,235
People say no one can build

343
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,446
a completely impenetrable wall.

344
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:08,240
-Why not?
-[employees] Why not?

345
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,451
And, you know, people say
you shouldn't start a company

346
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,745
without cracking the technology

347
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,707
that supports the flagship product
of the company.

348
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,626
For obvious reasons.

349
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,961
-Well, why not?
-[employees] Why not?

350
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,589
And what if you find out
you're never gonna get paid,

351
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,174
there is no product, and you're like,

352
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,967
"Well, we can't let him get away
with this."

353
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,887
-Well, why not?
-[employees murmuring]

354
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,805
[Ron] <i>That may have been a step too far.</i>

355
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:32,848
<i>But it wouldn't matter,</i>

356
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,351
<i>because Maeby had just gotten</i>
<i>some good news.</i>

357
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,685
Sorry, um, we-- we did it.

358
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,938
-What?
-We just sold Fakeblock.

359
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,648
-What?
-Yeah.

360
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,984
-We sold it? Uh, how much?
-Yeah.

361
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,111
Three million dollars.

362
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,947
-Three million dollars?
-[Maeby] Yeah.

363
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,115
That's way more
than Rebel was ever offering.

364
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,575
There's no way
she can be mad at me.

365
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,202
Who cares if she's mad
at you or not?

366
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,664
-We did it. We are geniuses.
-[George Michael] I can stop lying to Dad.

367
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,415
I mean, I feel bad for the new owner.

368
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,793
It's bogus software. I mean,
what if it bankrupts them?

369
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:01,710
Oh, click.

370
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,212
How sorry can you feel for some guy

371
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:07,716
who's obviously incredibly rich
and has $3 million to drop

372
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,135
on a .wav file
that's just the sound of a piece of wood.

373
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,013
[George Michael, laughing]
You know...

374
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,765
We had those checks issued to you,

375
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,351
and you're thinking,
"We want to cash those checks."

376
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,687
-Well, why not?
-[employees] Why not?

377
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,980
Why the hell not?

378
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,691
-[laughs] Yeah.
-Keep doing what you're doing.

379
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,067
-Cash those checks.
-[employees whoop]

380
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,027
-[George Michael] We've got jobs.
-[Ron] <i>While they were</i>

381
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,779
<i>-getting out of the business...</i>
-[Maeby] Except us.

382
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:31,198
-Yeah, we're out of here.
<i>-...directly upstairs,</i>

383
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,951
<i>George and Lucille were finally</i>
<i>back in it.</i>

384
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:36,078
-Hello, hello.
-[gasps] There he is,

385
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,871
the man of the hour!

386
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:39,873
You all right, Mom?

387
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,667
I'm just happy to see you.

388
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:42,918
That's what's off.

389
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,462
How was that meeting
with the Chinese investors?

390
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,840
It was fantastic. I mean,

391
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,967
that advice you gave us,
the honesty thing,

392
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,927
it was-- it was great. Thank you.

393
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,389
The truth came out of my mouth
as easy as any lie I could've thought of.

394
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,141
[George Sr.] She was so believable.

395
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,851
I thought she <i>was </i>lying.

396
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,311
[Lucille] It was
like the opposite of Pinocchio.

397
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,814
I swear, I think my nose got smaller.

398
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,524
Well, wouldn't have been the first time.

399
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,359
[George Sr.] Anyway, it worked.

400
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,070
The wall is off,
and we are out of that contract.

401
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,530
Everything is good.

402
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,532
-And we can start over.
-That's so great.

403
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,534
That's so great. That's just...
It's perfect.

404
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,202
You-- You know, you guys

405
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,872
finally discovered the value
of telling the truth.

406
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,874
I just-- I wish that you had learned that

407
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,625
before you lied to me.

408
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,544
Can you be more specific with that?

409
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:28,172
-There's been a number of lies.
-[Michael] Sure.

410
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,215
When you told me
that this company was bankrupt.

411
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,634
-But we <i>are </i>bankrupt, Michael.
-[George Sr.] Flat broke.

412
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:36,430
But the family business is still alive,
and the Bluths are back.

413
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:39,016
-We are bigger and better than ever.
-[Michael] Okay.

414
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:42,394
I dug a little bit deeper,
and I found some extra capital.

415
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,604
Really? That's fantastic.

416
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:44,563
-But how much?
-Yeah.

417
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,315
Hey, um... Oh, everybody's here.

418
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,192
-Hi.
-I was hoping to talk to you for a minute.

419
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,319
I have something
I want to discuss with you, too.

420
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,279
I was just gonna call down,
have you come up.

421
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:53,906
Mine is private. It's business-related.

422
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,909
Well, this is a business conference room.
Why don't you share it here?

423
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,036
-[sighs]
-You might as well just tell him.

424
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,665
-I sold Fakeblock.
-[Ron] <i>And as George Michael</i>

425
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,418
<i>prepared himself</i>
<i>for his father's disappointment...</i>

426
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,628
You what?

427
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,172
That's so great!

428
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,133
-You're not disappointed?
-Disappointed?

429
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:16,053
No, I'm not disappointed.
Boy, George Michael.

430
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,306
-And we got three mil for it.
-Come on.

431
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,767
You sold your first business,
and you got three million?

432
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:25,729
[shrieks] Three mil?
That is such great news!

433
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:29,441
Mr. Big Business,
sold your company. How do you feel?

434
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,902
To be honest,
I feel incredibly relieved.

435
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,738
I'm glad I stuck it out
and didn't declare bankruptcy.

436
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,365
It's been a tremendous pressure on us.

437
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:39,326
We had to pay off the employees,
and the bank took the rest of it,

438
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:42,579
-but I'm glad I'm back at zero.
-[George Sr.] We're both at zero.

439
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,456
-It's great.
-Did this by himself.

440
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,333
All that burden on your shoulders.

441
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,710
No one to help you. A little baby Atlas.

442
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,463
-Oh, is that how you see me?
-Hmm? Oh, doesn't matter.

443
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,882
Hey, I got an announcement
to make myself, okay?

444
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,300
Since I found some extra money,

445
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,970
I decided to expand.
And what is the company motto?

446
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,055
Find a little extra money,
put it in a Bluth.

447
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,475
<i>I </i>bought Fakeblock.

448
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:05,727
What?

449
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,312
[Maeby] No, um...

450
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,607
No, this company, uh, B.S. Enterprises,
bought Fakeblock.

451
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,777
I'm B.S. Enterprises.
It-- It was "Banana Stand,"

452
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,362
but it's also got a second meaning.

453
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,114
-Bullshit.
-Bluth and Son.

454
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:21,910
I bought you! I had to use a shell company
because I knew

455
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,287
you were gonna give me
a discount,

456
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,580
and I wasn't gonna have that.

457
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,124
You bought Fakeblock? This is...

458
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,376
This is a dream come true, is it not?

459
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:30,878
That's how I felt when I found

460
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,671
the money for it in a hidden account.

461
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,465
Well, that certainly explains
the complete lack of vetting

462
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,718
-of our software.
-[Michael] Mm-hmm, sure. Listen,

463
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,928
I'm not gonna get involved
in any of that tech stuff,

464
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,805
even though I did spend
that couple of months

465
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,183
at the Search campus.
But I'm not gonna start coding,

466
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:47,102
'cause if Fakeblock doesn't work,
we lose both companies for good.

467
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,061
You understand?

468
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,898
-[George Michael] I thought it was over.
-You thought it was over.

469
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,649
Look how emotional he is, huh?

470
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:56,028
Listen, that's why I stepped in.
Fakeblock ain't going nowhere.

471
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:59,907
[Ron] <i>But while Michael enjoyed</i>
<i>that the news made his son so happy,</i>

472
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,701
<i>he was even more eager</i>
<i>to see it do the opposite</i>

473
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:05,370
<i>-to his parents. </i>
-Where'd you find that three million?

474
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,956
In your banana stand slush fund.

475
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,875
I mean, I-- I know that you have been

476
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,545
ripping us off with money
for years, but $3 million?

477
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,505
-Shh.
-That's not our money, Michael.

478
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,007
Listen to me.
That money was given

479
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,219
to us by the Chinese
so we could give it back to them.

480
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,887
It was face-saving money.

481
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:24,139
And now you've spent it,
and on what?

482
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,308
My son's future.
And that money's gonna now save

483
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,769
the company, because it's invested
in something valuable.

484
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,355
[George Sr.] We were out.
You understand?

485
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,482
We were out. No wall. No wall.

486
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,859
But if the Chinese see
we're buying companies,

487
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,277
they're going to want it now.

488
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,529
And we are screwed.
Do you understand that?

489
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,950
You, me,
and especially George Michael.

490
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,993
-Unless you get the money back from him.
-No, no.

491
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,120
No, no. George Michael's
got nothing to do with this.

492
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,747
You better tell that to the Chinese,

493
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,875
because they will trace the $3 million
to him,

494
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,378
and they will be mildly displeased.

495
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:55,837
You have to get that money back.

496
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,215
They're going to be mildly displeased.

497
00:20:58,298 --> 00:20:59,758
Mildly displeased.

498
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:02,636
It's too late. You heard him.
He paid off his debts.

499
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,554
You just can't say I made a good decision.

500
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,556
Dad, I'm mildly displeased
about something.

501
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,892
This. This is what I spent your money on.
Look at him.

502
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,436
George Michael,
tell them how great your company is

503
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,108
and that the son they can't compliment
is about to make them rich.

504
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,402
Tell them that I made the right choice.

505
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,243
[sighs] You made the right choice.

506
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,870
Fakeblock is real.

507
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,999
It's a-- It's a very weird way

508
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:36,003
to say it, but, you know,
Fakeblock, it's real.

509
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,838
This is the--
This is the best investment

510
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,965
this family has made in years.

511
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,174
I feel sick.

512
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,426
I've felt better.

513
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:45,429
Wait till you find out
who the new president is.

514
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,848
-Oh, no.
-Did somebody say,

515
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,393
"Wait until you find out
who the president is"?

516
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:54,688
Yes, but then we figured it out,
and your father said, "Oh, no."

517
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,398
[George Sr.] SoÂ we've got $3 million

518
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,984
tied up in something Gob's in charge of?

519
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,945
[Maeby] Maybe we could just hire him,
like, a really good assistant.

520
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,488
One step ahead of you.

521
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,241
I took this guy home with me
last night after I found him

522
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,160
next to the police station.

523
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:11,288
Please say hello
to my new right-hand man!

524
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,461
-Now, geo-bead.
-Did somebody say,

525
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,629
"I took this guy home with me
after I found him

526
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:22,758
next to the police station. Say hello..."

527
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,428
[Gob] Well, that would've been better
if it was his right hand,

528
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:31,308
but, uh... but I figured, if somebody's
willing to spend 3KK on my company,

529
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:35,979
-might be able to spread wealth on myself.
-Did my hand get off on this floor?

530
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,523
Well, look who finally decided to show up.

531
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:41,109
Steve McQueen from <i>The Great Escape.</i>

532
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,237
I take it you saw the unwanted posters?

533
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,114
[Buster] Yes, and I got the hint.

534
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,367
-No one was chasing after me.
-[Lucille gasps]

535
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,744
Oh, right. It had two meanings.

536
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,245
Well, I'm sorry.

537
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,998
But if you hadn't insisted
on being in that stupid parade,

538
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,625
none of this would've happened.

539
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,378
Yes, well,
that parade created a great deal of...

540
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,880
pain for a lot of us.

541
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:05,550
âª <i>Who's gonna tell you when... </i>âª

542
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,719
But, anyway, we're here to celebrate.

543
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:10,180
I'm sure somebody did something
to make this a party

544
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,640
-for the president.
-[elevator dings]

545
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:12,766
Bluth?

546
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:14,601
[George Sr.] Wait a minute.
What's going on?

547
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:15,936
Oh, Wait, what's going...

548
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,938
Who did this?
Is this because I'm still gay?

549
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:21,024
Hot Cops? On such short notice?
Who did this?

550
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,610
-'Cause the conversion didn't take?
-Buster Bluth?

551
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,487
Yes! Who did this?

552
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,656
-Who did this?
-You're under arrest.
